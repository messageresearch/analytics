TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. Sometimes I think we we won't really fully understand it till we get there. &gt;&gt; We get a glimpse of it inside of our life, our heart, but perfect love. That's who God is. It's a person, the very person of Jesus Christ. Are you thankful to be in his house this morning? Amen. We come to worship him, spirit and truth. And so, just turn to your neighbor and shake each other's hand as we sing that once more. Oh, when we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus and sing and shout the victory. Oh, sing the wondrous love of Jesus. See his mercy and it's about his grace in the meion bright and left. Oh, he'll prepare for salation. Oh, when we all get together. What a day of rejoicing that will be when we all see Jesus sing and shout victory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that course touching Jesus. And uh we're going to ask brother Jeffrey if he would come and lead us in Bible reading this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're just thankful for God. Uh I I love to use people and their gifts and talents in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, your body was made to walk and to move and to exercise and to each member has a part and plays. And so we just thank the Lord for &gt;&gt; um him using all of us in our capacity. You just never know what you know, brother Brown said, if you if you ever think, Lord, what do you want to use me for? He said, try it. If you feel that desire of something, see if God uses that gift in your life. You never know what God can can do through through your life. So, we're going to ask him to come this morning. Touching Jesus is all that really matters. And your life will never be the same. There is only one way to touch you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all come expecting expecting to get fed this morning. &gt;&gt; All right. All right, we're going to be reading from uh Romans 8 1-2 and we'll speak to the author before we go to the word. Bow your heads. Precious heavenly father, Lord, we just thank you for this wonderful day you've given us, Lord, and the opportunity for us to come together and worship you. We just thank you for all your blessings, Lord, you bestow upon each one of us, Lord. And we just ask that you come down, Lord, and open our hearts tonight this this morning, Lord, that we may receive you and and just be with all the ones here this morning and be with brother Daryl, Lord, as he's studying, Lord. Just you come through him and speak to us, Lord, and and we come with expectations, Lord, and bless the reading of the word. We ask all these things in your precious name, Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; For the law, the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death. &gt;&gt; For what the law could not do, and that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh. and for sin condemn sin in the flesh &gt;&gt; that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. &gt;&gt; To be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is immity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; but ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit. If so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not in the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sit righteousness. &gt;&gt; But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh. &gt;&gt; Thank you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. Brother, um continue to remember brother Donnie in your prayer. I know um him having a um his surgery. He's a former Marine and it's hard to uh hold hold down a former Marine. He said, "I want to be there." I said, "You let your body heal. just just let let the Lord work in your body, you know, and uh you just watch. We're we're here and the Lord knows all things. So, but we're we're thankful for brother Donnie, brother Kie. Uh I call brother Kie our um Errol Jones.

There you purchase my redemption when you broke sin heart and set my spirit free. Hallelujah. Oh, I'm amazed that you love me. Yes, I'm amazed that you came through your precious blood I found pardon and my sins are all they're all washed away. Oh, my sins are washed away. And yes, it's true. There have been days when I felt you. Lord, you know the many times I've gone astray, but I've learned your love is stronger than. Are you thankful for that this morning? And your ear is open every time I pray. No one else has ever cared for me like you, Lord. Other friends could never be so close to me. And I'm not afraid to face the problems of tomorrow.

It just breaks. It loose you. And we're thankful to our living God that comes with a quickening power &gt;&gt; that endows us that he can &gt;&gt; he can free us. &gt;&gt; But the key is to know you're already freed. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's the that's the the faith that can come to a person.

We appreciate everybody for coming and cooking and all that. We had uh had a a rather large crowd yesterday. So, we sure appreciate all the food that you that you cooked. And brother Daryl poured his heart out yesterday. Well, he's rested up, ready to pour his heart out again today. And uh he'll be with us uh today. And then we'll uh I'll be speaking this coming Wednesday and get everything started. Sunday before Sunday, it's going to sound weird. We're going to start on the seals, but I want you to read Christ the mystery of God revealed. Read the book. Listen to the tape. Christ is the mystery of God revealed. All right. Between now and Sunday, Sunday, we'll start on the uh on the seals and the teaching there. But just keep us in prayer. You stay in prayer for yourself that we'll receive. And just remember, too, that the banquet, you need to RSVP or sign up downstairs. If you're bringing someone with you, uh a couple, now these couples now, not individual, couples. If you're bringing couples with you, we need to RSVP them also. That way we can have enough for the caterer and that Anna and them can get all the um plates all to accommodate that many people. Uh the group from Ohio is coming and they're going to be here Friday and we're going to uh have a little fellowship with them and then Saturday and then brother Isaac will be speaking just for a few moments Saturday at the banquet and then Sunday brother Eric Gael from Honduras uh will be here speaking for us on Sunday they're coming to the banquet also. So uh we when we were what when we were over there in what December uh Christine we were there in December and I asked him I said you like to come. He said yeah I'd like to come. I said, "Well, you're preaching that Sunday." If you come, if you're going to drive all the way from Honduras, you might as well do something. But everybody knows Brother Eric and we love him and support him and and love him with the love of the Lord. So, and also remember that if you are coming to the banquet, there will be and you need to or we can help you make arrangements for babysitting because there's some won't be going. I think maybe there'll be some coming from Ohio that's single that may help, but we will find a babysitter somewhere. My house is open like it always is. Hannah, my daughter, said she would be there to help us. So, if anybody needs a babysitter, uh we'll find you one. But, uh this is this is a uh I don't know, we've tried to figure out how many years it was. It's at least 15 or more that we've had the the Valentine's banquet, and it's got bigger and bigger every year. So, uh, it's just a time we can all get together and what said there stays there. &gt;&gt; One more time, what's said there stays there. &gt;&gt; No, we have a good time in the Lord. We'll have a good catered meal and then we will uh then we'll uh do some games and prizes and have brother Isaac speak a minute for us and and then we will uh have a good time just fellowshipping with each other. Uh, good to see brother K's with us today. I missed you the other day when I wasn't here, but good to see you, man. Good, good to have you with us. And uh we love you with the love of the Lord. Good to have our brother back with us there. Good to see you. Yep. Good to have you back with us. Amen. You ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the most important thing. Listen, I sp I spoke Wednesday in what? Expectation. Did you expect you was going to hear from God today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I got up this morning expecting that God was going to speak to me through song, Jeffrey, and Amy. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was a surprise. It really wasn't a surprise. Something I was expecting. So, the Lord places people in, takes people out, puts people in. If God does it, it's always going to be successful. Always. &gt;&gt; So, good to have them. They've grown up in this church, brought their kids up in the church, and we sure do appreciate them and appreciate that uh Brother Jeff helping us out there with the with our responsive reading. So, all minds and hearts clear, you're expecting something. &gt;&gt; We're expecting to hear from God today. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're not expecting to hear from God, like I said before, if you're expecting and you got so much expectation, just drop a little over on your neighbor that ain't expecting much. Amen. If your cup overflows, what does it do? Just makes a mess everywhere, doesn't it? Just all falls all over the counter and everything. Well, all right, Sister Regina, you just let it all pour out. Let it all go and we'll be sitting over there and get all kind of wet. I want to get wet by the what? The water of the word. &gt;&gt; So, let's sing as our brother comes, Brother Daryl Ward from Johnson City, Tennessee. He's always he I always ask him to come and already ask him for next year in January if we're still here because I believe that he is one of the most humble men I've ever met and he has a testimony and the Lord has used him. I told him you know he was in the operating room for about 15 years um there in in Tennessee and and I told him I said you probably helped more people out of the operating room than you ever helped in the operating room those 15 years. And he told me a couple of testimonies. One for sure that that God moved on somebody. If if I'm operated on, I want some holy hands around there somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Daryl was there and he he prayed for this one man that they the doctor pronounced him he was not going to live. He was going to die. And God just give him 10 more years. &gt;&gt; 10 years. &gt;&gt; 10 more years. The doctor said he'll never survive. He'll never make it. But he did. But he just didn't that position didn't know the great physician, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cuz he was practicing and the God we got don't practice. He does what he said he'd do. So let's sing as we have our brother come, brother Daryl Warden from Johnson City, Tennessee, and speak for us today. Long reserve for our walk in this world. They resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God impart. Words of life, words of hope gives us strength and helps us cope. In this world, wherever we roll, the word of God will guide us home. Word of God, ever true, never failure, changing me and changing you. And we have come with open hearts. Let the word of God impart and holy works of our faith is handed down to this age. Great warriors brought you the word through sacrifice. Oh he the faithful work of Christ. Holy word, long brings everything for our in this world. We resound with God's own heart. Oh, let the word of God. Words of God, ever true changing me and changing you. We have come with open hearts. Oh, let the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To me, that's the key is to come with an open heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we sing that song, Fill My Cup. But I believe if we had a real revelation of how the Lord wanted to bless us, we would sing Fill My Truck. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the prophet said he wants to give you the Holy Ghost even more than you want to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of God, how rich, how pure. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. I was thinking as singing that song of way up in the cold country of Alaska, the little Eskimo village of Chivac. They was singing that song. It just took me back there for a minute there. Precious people back up there about 150 mile below the Arctic Circle. No red lights, no cars, just snowmobiles and four-wheelers, but they love the Lord just as much as you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and count it an honor to be with you once again and certainly enjoyed the song service and the fellowship and appreciate the food yesterday and all the hands provided. It was just it was just wonderful to see some brother Mike Hannis and some of those folks. It was just really such a good time and &gt;&gt; thank you for allowing us to come. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles this morning, turn with us to the book of Mark. We want to read from Mark chapter 14 at verse 36. And I bring you greetings from my pastor, brother Donnie Reagan. Told me to tell you all hello and bring greetings to you from my family. and we just count it an honor to be here and with you today. Mark chapter 14 verse 36. The Bible says this. And he said, "Aba Father, &gt;&gt; all things are possible unto thee." &gt;&gt; Amen. take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, &gt;&gt; but what thou wilt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he cometh and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Couldest thou not watch one hour? Watch ye and pray, least ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. And again he went away and prayed and spake the same words. &gt;&gt; And when he returned, he found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy, neither witch day what to answer him. And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, sleep on now. Take your rest. It is enough. The hour is come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us go. Lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. Let's bow our heads. I want to speak to this morning for just a few minutes on the season of recognition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or the hour is come. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; thank you Lord for all that you've done for us. Bless your children today Lord as we surrender this congregation and oursel into your hands for your glory in Jesus name. God bless you. You may be seated. Go with me this morning for just a minute. We take this little trip. We find oursel in a garden and we see a man kneeling, crying out and we notice that he's shaken &gt;&gt; and afraid. And we know that the Bible teaches us that this man went a stone throw away from his friends to pray because he needed to be alone. And yet he didn't want to be alone. &gt;&gt; For it was his hour of rrestling out his will. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that he prayed earnestly that if there should be a way that the cup could pass from him. And we can almost hear him as he's crying out saying, "Father, all things are possible. You can do anything. Don't make me drink this cup. And he gets up and he goes back and he finds his disciples sleeping and he says, "Wake up. Pray with me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; "Would you just pray with me?" And he goes back and the Bible says that being in agony, he prayed more earnestly. And this sweat, as it were, great drops of blood fall into the ground. And we see him in his flesh, in his shaken, and in his fear, and in his rrestle. And you said Jesus afraid. Well, the Bible says, "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him who was able to save him from death, &gt;&gt; and was heard in that he feared, &gt;&gt; and he prayed more earnestly, as it were, as sweat, were great drops of blood falling to the ground." Amen. &gt;&gt; Now there is a medical condition called hematradosis. And hematidosis is a rare medical condition where the sweat glands that contain the capillaries that feed the sweat glands, they rupture and seep into the sweat glands and they actually sweat blood. &gt;&gt; It can be triggered by extreme physical and emotional anguish. And he comes back to find Peter and him sleeping. And he says, "Peter, wake up, Peter. &gt;&gt; Could you not watch with me one hour?" &gt;&gt; And Peter, I could just see him as he he wakes up and he maybe rubbing his eyes. He says, "Master, is a what's the matter? You're shaking? Is that is that blood on you? Are you bleeding?" He said, "Peter, watch with me. Help me pray. said, 'Lord, what what shall I pray? And the Bible says he comes back a third time. And when he comes back the third time, he said unto them, "Sleep on and take your rest. It's enough. The hour is come. &gt;&gt; Behold, he, the son of man, is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise up, let us go. Lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand." Now the hour had come. The hour denotes a certain definite time or season. And Jesus was saying here speaking he said father the time has come. Now the prophet said there's seasons for everything. Do you believe that you sew in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there's seasons when the time comes that's right for things to happen. He said do you believe that? See see certain seasons bring certain responses. Yes. &gt;&gt; Watermelon and picnics in the summer cuz it's the season. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Hot chocolate and vegetable soup &gt;&gt; in the winter &gt;&gt; because it's the season for it. And each season carries its anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each season carries its anointing. There's things that God has promised for this age that would happen. And there's a people on the earth now whose very purpose for being here is to fulfill these promises. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For this cause was they born. You were born for a purpose. The season of these things to happen is here. The hour has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was praying to the father. He acknowledged that he is aware that this is his time. All the preparation, the first two pulls of his ministry, all the fishes and the loaves and the miracles was to get the people's attention to a vindicate who he was. It had come down to this very hour. The hour is come. Jesus coming down to the end of his ministry and his very purpose for being on the earth. The hour of his purpose had come and the words of the prophets would be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we find Jesus now in Pilate's hall, judgment hall, betrayed by a message follower &gt;&gt; who walked with him, who said he loved him, who was a part of the message. Now all of a sudden, he forsakes the message and betrays the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my God, &gt;&gt; where are we at? &gt;&gt; Judas sold him out for 30 pieces of silver. &gt;&gt; Today, they sell him out for an internet spot. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pilate said unto him, "Art thou a king then?" And Jesus answered, "Thou sayest, I a king. To this end was I born. For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth, AND EVERYONE THAT IS OF the truth &gt;&gt; heareth my voice." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That ought to make you shout this morning. Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice. &gt;&gt; The hour has come. the season, the words that the prophet has spoke has come into manifestation IN PILATE'S JUDGMENT HALL. THEY SAID, "PILATE, this man claims to be the son of God." &gt;&gt; When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was more afraid. And he went again into the judgment hall and said unto Jesus, "Whence art thou?" But Jesus gave him no answer. &gt;&gt; He stood before Pilate, and Pilate SAID, "WHAT IS TRUTH?" Think about this. He said, "Pilate standing there. Jesus standing there." And Pilate says, "What is truth?" AND TRUTH WAS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE HIM &gt;&gt; and he didn't recognize it. And we're LIVING IN THE SAME ERA WHERE PEOPLE ARE TODAY ARE SAYING, "WHAT is truth?" &gt;&gt; Because of all the AI and the things people don't even know what to believe. WE'VE MADE FULL CIRCLE. WE'RE BACK HERE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND TRUTH IS STANDING BEFORE THIS NATION AND THEY'VE REJECTED IT. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Then said Pilate unto him, Speakst thou not unto me? Knowest thou not I have power to crucify thee, and I have power to release thee? And Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above. &gt;&gt; Therefore, he that deliverth me unto thee hath the greater sin. &gt;&gt; The hour has come for the fulfillment of the prophecy. God's word will not return unto him void. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. THEN IF GOD SAID THERE'LL BE A RAPTURE, THERE'LL BE A RAPTURE. IF THE GOD SAID OUR BODIES WILL BE CHANGED in a moment, in a TWINKLE OF AN EYE, THAT'S THE WAY IT'LL BE. AMEN. THE WORD WILL not return unto him void, &gt;&gt; but it will accomplish that which it was sent to do. AND NO ONE CAN STOP IT. OH, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOBODY CAN, NO GOVERNMENT, NO NATION, NO WAR, NO NUCLEAR WEAPON CAN STOP GOD FROM FULFILLING HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. No one can stop it. Jesus recognized his hour. said, "The hour has come." The hour has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Came time for Noah to go into the ark. Look, Noah could not have gone into the ark before God was ready for him to go. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet said God would not be a just God to send someone to judgment that was just. And Noah, oh, don't miss this. Noah was the preparation before judgment. &gt;&gt; They rejected him. They rejected his message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just think about it for a minute. If this congregation right here was the days of Noah, do you realize only eight of us would went into that boat? &gt;&gt; Think about that. &gt;&gt; Think about that. What a small minority. If this was the days of Noah, only eight in this room would have got into that boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Would you have got in it, &gt;&gt; brother? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? Yes. &gt;&gt; Would you have got in the boat? Only eight souls did. &gt;&gt; But in order to get into the boat, you would have had to one to believe he was a prophet against all those who said he was false. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You had to believe that his message was from God, REGARDLESS OF HOW SIMPLE it was. &gt;&gt; Three, you had to go against all the INTERNET AND THE SCIENCE IN THAT DAY &gt;&gt; THAT said that it's it's not going to rain. THERE'S NOTHING UP THERE FOR IT TO RAIN. HE'S NOTHING BUT A LIAR. &gt;&gt; BUT I TELL YOU THIS MORNING, IF YOU COULD SEE YOUR DAY, HALLELUJAH, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HIS DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. FOR THE SAME GOD THAT REVEALED IT TO NOAH HAS REVEALED OUR DAY TO US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the season came for Noah to go into the ark, God shut the door behind Noah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Noah didn't shut the door. GOD DID. AND ALL OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE ELSE TO EVER ENTER WAS gone because God had closed the door. Amen. The hour had come. The season was right. Amen. Noah's message was the preparation for escape. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you just imagine? Look at just a moment. God was preparing. Noah's preaching. And the first thing you know, WHILE ONE DAY THERE COME A THUNDER, A blast and I see the first lightning come up and flash across the sky. The season of fulfillment had come. The hour had come for Noah to go into the ark. He began to fill the pool. &gt;&gt; And Noah said, "Come on, honey." Boy said to the wives, "Come on, honey." And they got into the ark. And the people said, "I wonder what happened." &gt;&gt; A blast went off somewhere. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A ROCKET OR SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; A BLAST WENT OFF SOMEWHERE AND A CLOUD BEGAN TO RISE. WHAT WAS IT? A SIGN THAT THE HOUR IS COME. THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROPHET'S MESSAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Noah's message was the preparation for the escape. AND WITH THE BLAST OF THUNDER AND THE RISING OF A SUPERNATURAL CLOUD &gt;&gt; WAS THE evidence that the message was ripe. THERE WAS A BLAST FOLLOWED BY A CLOUD AND THE CLOUD WAS THE SIGN. BEHOLD, THE RAIN COMETH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH, think about this. IT HAD NOT RAINED FOR THREE and a half years of a drought. He was in the land and up on a mountain PRAYING SIX TIMES HE SENT GAHESA. NOTHING. There's nothing out there. &gt;&gt; The seventh time he sent Gahesa. And Gahesa come back. He said, "I see a cloud the size of a man's hand. Right? &gt;&gt; IN A HOT, DRY CLIMATE WHERE THERE HAD BEEN NO RAIN FOR three and a half years, &gt;&gt; A CLOUD THAT SMALL WOULD HAVE just vapored away. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; BUT WHY DIDN'T IT? BECAUSE IT WAS A SUPERNATURAL CLOUD. &gt;&gt; AND IT TESTIFIED. WHAT DID THAT CLOUD TESTIFY OF? AN ABUNDANCE OF RAIN WAS COMING. &gt;&gt; The hour had come. The rain WAS GOING TO FALL. GOD VINDICATED HIS PROPHET. THE CLOUD WAS THE RECOGNITION that the rain was coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And they got into the ARK AND GOD SHUT THE DOOR. AND ALL THOSE WHO LAUGHED AT HIM AND MOCKED AT HIM, ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE RAIN BEGIN TO FALL. BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I can hear him cry out, "Oh, Noah. Noah, we was just aggravating YOU, BUDDY. PLEASE LET US IN. LET US IN. NOAH, OPEN THE DOOR. For God's sake, Noah, IF YOU DON'T TAKE ME, TAKE MY BABY. DON'T LET MY BABY PERISH. LET ME IN. LET ME IN. But you see, Noah could not OPEN THE DOOR CUZ HE NEVER SHUT IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I TELL you young people, I tell you, brother, sister, if you feel that pull today AND YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU NEED TO BE, GET INSIDE THE ARK OF SAFETY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity to escape this unto generation. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; The prophet told the story of the son of man who owned the company, the meat packing company of Chicago. And he went out west to a ranch to find a bride. And he asked this little girl if she would marry him. And she said yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's got to be more than a nod. You've got to make your voice heard. You've got to identify your voice with this message. And the best way to do it is WITH AN AMEN AND A HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE IT, LORD. &gt;&gt; He asked her, "Will you marry me?" She said, "Yes." And he promised her he would come back FOR HER AT A CERTAIN TIME FOR HER to be ready. &gt;&gt; Now, notice this. As the season approached, all that time after he left, she was among all these other ranch workers and all these other people. But all of a sudden, when the season was right, she goes into a little room &gt;&gt; and puts on a wedding garment. &gt;&gt; Not one person of that ranch helped her. &gt;&gt; N &gt;&gt; you see, she made herself &gt;&gt; ready. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she came out no longer identify as a as a dishwash lady. Right? &gt;&gt; SHE CAME OUT IDENTIFIED AS A BRIDE. AND AS SHE BEGAN TO IDENTIFY AND EXPRESS WHO SHE WAS, THAT'S WHEN the critics started. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Are you hearing me, friends? Do you not see where we're at? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. She made herself ready. And the first thing you know, what did they do? THEY GOT AROUND HER, BE TO DANCE AND SING SONGS AND MAKE FUN OF her &gt;&gt; and made out like they WERE THE BRIDE, PRETENDING to be a bride. BUT IT ALL THE CRITICS, ALL THE HARASSMENT, ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY POSTED ON THE INTERNET, IT DID NOT BOTHER HER. &gt;&gt; SHE WAS CERTAIN, AMEN, THAT THE PROMISE THAT HE HAD GAVE HER WAS TRUE. &gt;&gt; Her eyes wouldn't critics. Her eyes was on the promise. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS MORNING? DON'T LOOK AT THE CRITICS. LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; She watched that little old clock tick up and the first thing you know it was about one minute. Oh, I saw the other day that that doomsday clock, I forget how many seconds they said it was 45, 50, something like that, seconds from destruction. The old clock is ticking right up. And she was watching that clock in about 1 minute. Oh my. And someone said, "I thought he was coming. He's supposed to be HERE AT A SUCH AND SUCH TIME. Don't worry. He'll be here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all I want to know. He promised he'd be here. That's all I want to know. HE'S COMING. THAT'S ALL. WHEN I DON'T KNOW, but I'll be ready when he comes. I'VE GOT THE WEDDING GARMENT ON. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'VE DRESSED MYSELF IN THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The hour has come for his return. The season is right. The promise isn't true. Amen. And right while they were making the most fun. While they were making the most fun and all these different things about her and teasing her and making fun of her and everything, they heard the wheels are coming and the horse hoofs are beating and the old grind of the sand under THE BOOKBOARD AND SHE BROKE THROUGH THOSE LINES AND OUT INTO THE YARD she went. WHO WAS IT? THERE HE WAS DRESSED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE CARRIAGE WAS READY. AND HE GRABBED her into his arms and put her up on the bookboard and turned the carriage to Chicago. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll come for you. He promised her. And when you see this happening, get ready. The hour has come. &gt;&gt; The pool &gt;&gt; is at hand. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in John 16:21, "A woman when she is in travail have sorrow because her hour has come. But as soon as she's delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish &gt;&gt; for joy that a man is born into the world. A woman knows when it's her hour, not the neighbors, &gt;&gt; not the neighbor's time, not someone else's time, but that birth pain strikes her. She recognizes it &gt;&gt; that the hour, her hour &gt;&gt; has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have at home a program called Ask a Nurse. My wife is a registered nurse, surgical nurse, and she was pregnant with Jessica, our first child. We, well, we actually lost our first child, but Jessica, our second child, and she was pregnant with Jessica, and it was on a Saturday morning, and I was going to go down in the backyard and cut some trees. And Cheryl came out on the back porch. And she said, "Honey," I said, "Yes." She said, "It's time. I I need to go." And I said, "Are you sure?" I said, "Maybe we should call Ask a nurse because you can call them and ask them, you know, and they'll tell you whether you should come in or not." I said, "Maybe we should call Ask a nurse." And my wife, God bless her heart, just as calm, she goes, "But I am a nurse." I said, "Oh yeah, I'll get the bag." Oh my, you got to love your wife, you know. &gt;&gt; But it was her hour. the the recognition that our HOUR HAS COME. THE season of fulfillment had come and Jessica was born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints, THE HOUR'S COME. ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU FEELING THE BULL, THE BIRTH PAIN? DO YOU FEEL THAT PULL? WE'VE CAN PASS THIS MOUNTAIN LONG ENOUGH. TURN YE NORTHWARD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The hour's come. That's what the church is doing today. For Jesus is the word and he's the bridegroom and the bride is a part of the groom. Therefore, the word that is to be fulfilled in this day is the same word that was fulfilled in his day. &gt;&gt; It's the same word, same experience, SAME LIFE, SAME WORD, same experience, same life. &gt;&gt; What the same mean? It means the same. &gt;&gt; Israel's in her homeland. Elijah's done come and gone. There's a rapture of the church. Amen. THAT IS BONE OF HIS BONE, FLESH OF HIS FLESH, WORD OF HIS WORD, LIFE OF HIS LIFE. SHE WILL be him expressed. The works he DOES, SHE WILL DO ALSO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's a season of recognition. The hour has come. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED ON SUNSET PEAK on Sunset Mountain? LOOK IT UP AND SEE SUNSET PEAK ON SUNSET MOUNTAIN. A BLAST FOLLOWED BY A CLOUD OF SEVEN ANGELS VINDICATING THAT THE MESSAGE WAS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID, "SOON COMETH THE REAL RAIN." &gt;&gt; Not just the rain, but the real rain. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see why I've been so zealous of the kind of seed I planted for the body. The rain's going to fall pretty soon. I mean, the real rain. &gt;&gt; And it's got to have a seed to fall on. &gt;&gt; It's got to have a seed to fall on. I hope I live to see it. Do you understand now? It'll be the living word. Not the written word, but the living word. &gt;&gt; THE WORD MADE FLESH AND LIVING. AMEN. THE living word as it was at the beginning. THE SPOKEN WORD OF GOD HAVE HIS POWER FOR IT IS in him. &gt;&gt; His own body working his own way. Looking to the promises THAT GOD GAVE THIS BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE PROMISES THAT GOD GAVE THIS BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You see, if you taught Methodist message, it wouldn't work for us. It takes no effect on us because this is not Methodist time. THIS IS BRIDE TIME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; If Moses taught the message of Noah, it would take no effect. If Jesus taught Moses message, it would take no effect. The predestinated seed are laying there will only be watered by that type of water that's given &gt;&gt; for that seed. &gt;&gt; So, the anointing that falls UPON THE BRIDE. IT'S NOT A METHODIST anointing or a Lutheran. COME ON, SOMEBODY. BUT IT IS AN ANOINTING. AN ANOINTING THAT'LL FALL UPON A PREDESTINATED SEED. AND THE SEED of the anointing WILL MATCH. AND WHAT WILL IT DO? BUT IT'LL BRING FORTH FRUIT for his kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; A tree is known by its fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The beauty of a tree is NOT THE BRANCH. IT'S THE FRUIT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's given for that seed. It won't grow under any condition. It must be the condition that grows it. And when you see the church getting worldly like it was in the days of Sodom, &gt;&gt; you know, like when they're now in the church world today, &gt;&gt; they're allowing trans v. &gt;&gt; They're wearing transsexuals to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're having they're having men dressed like women teaching Sunday school &gt;&gt; as it was in the days OF SODOM. SO IS IT IN THIS DAY. BUT AIN'T IT SOMETHING? ALL OF A SUDDEN, EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT TRANS. A change from one to another. &gt;&gt; If the world's looking at a trans, I'm looking at a trans, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not changing to a woman, BUT CHANGING. OH, HALLELUJAH. CHANGING INTO THAT IMAGE GOD HAD OF ME BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SEE, SODOM, see the world all going into worship the God of this evil age. and seeing that and seeing A LITTLE MINORITY GROUP gathered under the INSPIRATION OF GOD PRODUCING again &gt;&gt; the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You see, if a farmer goes and plants his seed and covers it up, he must let that seed go through the full cycle of growth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because if he harvestes it any other time prior to the maturity of that seed, &gt;&gt; he can never have another crop. So he must wait till that seed comes to maturity before he harvestes it. And once it comes to maturity, he can take THAT SEED BECAUSE THAT SEED HAS THE ABILITY to reproduce itself again. And when will Christ TAKE HIS CHURCH WHEN SHE HAS THE ABILITY TO REPRODUCE HIM AGAIN ON THE EARTH, MAKING THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE THE SAME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, we just came through Christmas with three planets lined up. It made the announcement of THE BRIDEGROOM ON THE EARTH, &gt;&gt; CHRIST on the earth. &gt;&gt; But what did the prophet say? I believe it was 1964. I believe it was THAT FIVE PLANETS LINED UP. AND WHAT DID THE PROPHET SAY? IT WAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE BRIDE ON THE EARTH in infancy. &gt;&gt; But a man don't marry a baby, but he must wait till she comes into her season. The hour has come for her season of love. And when she enters that SEASON OF LOVE, SHE CAN reproduce him again. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, God. I see it, but I want to see it more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Producing again the life of Jesus CHRIST BY THE SCRIPTURES THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. You know what hour that you're living in. The Bible fortell by prophecy, &gt;&gt; what day that we're living and what time we're living and what kind of events ought to be taking place. It foretells it exactly to the letter. &gt;&gt; Amen. Huh? Ain't it something that all of a sudden our government is now investigating UFOs after all these years of people seeing UFO sightings and now our government is trying to figure out what they are? Well, they could come and ask us. We'd have saved them a lot of money because we had a prophet to tell us that they were investigating angels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said one day they'll drop DOWN AND WHEN THEY GO, YOU'LL GO WITH THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You see the hour that we're living in, friends. Amen. And it'll not miss one age. Not one time. It fortells exactly to the letter. Has never missed one age all the time. Not one time has it ever missed and it won't. FOR WHO ARE PREDESTINATED TO SEE IT? &gt;&gt; Will see it. Jesus said, "No man can COME TO ME EXCEPT MY FATHER DRAWS HIM FIRST, AND ALL THAT MY FATHER HATH GIVEN ME will come." &gt;&gt; It's the word joining the word. The word joining with the word. It can do nothing else. We know it. The day that we're living in, the hour has come. The season of recognition of who I am. &gt;&gt; Who I am. Who am I? I'm not a church member. &gt;&gt; I'm not just a message follower. Don't misunderstand me. &gt;&gt; But more than that, &gt;&gt; the word becoming flesh, THE PROMISED WORD FOR THIS DAY, &gt;&gt; being watered BY AN ANOINTING TO BRING FORTH THAT seed to do what? To reproduce. Not another church, NOT ANOTHER ORGANIZATION, BUT TO reproduce Christ. &gt;&gt; He said, "A little while the world will see me no more, BUT YE SHALL SEE ME." HOW, LORD? HOW? FOR I'LL BE WITH YOU, &gt;&gt; even &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. At the same time, the bride has recognized the evening light has just began to recognize the hungry Pentecostals have began to recognize them organizations hasn't got it. And the things they're looking for, they're so twisted and torup. It's the time of recognition. Recognition. You've got to recognize. The world has recognized. THE NATIONS HAS RECOGNIZED. SCIENCE HAS RECOGNIZED. THE DEVIL HAS recognized it's a time he can wreck havoc on women, wreck the church, WRECK THE PEOPLE. HE'S RECOGNIZED IT. &gt;&gt; AND GOD HAS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE'S A PEOPLE ON THE EARTH THAT HE PREDESTINATED TO LIFE. He's recognized it's THE TIME TO SEND HIS MESSAGE. AND HE'S DID IT. THE PEOPLE HAS RECOGNIZED IT. THE BRIGHT TIME has realized the evening light. &gt;&gt; You see, the prophet SAID, "THE WORD MANIFESTED FOR THAT HOUR IS THE LIGHT OF THAT HOUR." &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. THE WORD MANIFESTED FOR THAT HOUR IS THE LIGHT OF THAT HOUR. &gt;&gt; THEN THE evening light, the evening light is just not the name of the church. &gt;&gt; The evening light is you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the light of the world." And then he said, "You're the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:26, "Even the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now he may has made manifest to his saints, &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest to his saints." It denotes a set time or a season like the song Amazing Grace. I once was lost, but now &gt;&gt; I'm found. &gt;&gt; To whom God would make known. To whom God would make known. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Uh that'd be us. &gt;&gt; WHICH IS CHRIST IN YOU. &gt;&gt; CHRIST IN YOU. &gt;&gt; THE HOPE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Of glory. &gt;&gt; The action. You see the action of the mystery unfolding. It's causing a reaction &gt;&gt; to those it's unfolding to. &gt;&gt; It's causing a reaction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery unfolding is causing a reaction to those that's unfolding to. Paul is telling us here in the book OF COLOSSIANS THAT GOD HAD THIS GREAT MYSTERY HID FROM AGES and from generations &gt;&gt; until a set season or a time &gt;&gt; that he would make the mystery known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now why AFTER AGES AND GENERATIONS WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS MYSTERY THAT GOD KEPT IN HIMSELF, WHY WOULD ALL of a sudden &gt;&gt; he would want it to be made known? Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery, this mystery that he would make it known at a set SEASON OR A SET TIME. I SAY TO YOU THIS MORNING THAT THIS IS THE TIME &gt;&gt; when the time comes to make known that this hidden mystery when it comes time to be made known. How would he do it? How would he make this mystery known? &gt;&gt; Paul tells us in Ephesians 3:3 how that by revelation, &gt;&gt; right? By revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in few words. REVELATION IT EQUALS MANIFESTATION. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID GOD DOES IT AND then he reveals it. &gt;&gt; He makes the mystery known by revelation. IT EQUALS MANIFESTATION. THE MANIFESTATION OF THE BRIDE IS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE MYSTERY has been released. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's secret mystery that he had before the world began. Now in THE BACK PART OF GOD'S MIND, WE SAID IT YESTERDAY. THIS MYSTERY LAID IN THE BACK OF GOD'S MIND, &gt;&gt; something that he was trying, he was going to achieve. He had a motive in doing it. God just don't do something just to do it. Everything he does is for a purpose. &gt;&gt; He had a motive in doing it. In order to do what? In order to let himself be expressed. &gt;&gt; God had this secret in his mind. Nobody knew nothing about it. For who had access to God's mind? He allowed Moses to go back to the beginning. That was as far as Moses could go. &gt;&gt; But think of it. Oh God, think of it. In this hour that we're living in, HE ALLOWED THE PROPHET OF MALACHI 45 AND SIX TO GO INTO THE BACK PART OF GOD'S MIND &gt;&gt; TO catch this secret and to reveal it to his bride. &gt;&gt; Now, why would God suddenly want this secret to be made known? A secret that he had kept down through the ages and generations. There must be somebody on the earth now who can receive it. A PREDESTINATED CHOSEN BODY OF PEOPLE on the earth that knows what he wants done with his word. For the PROPHET SAYS SHALL HAVE THUS SAYAITH the Lord &gt;&gt; or keep still. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When a son of God by faith takes the word of God into his heart and speaks it back up on his lips, it's just the same as deity speaking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, we just came through Christmas and I don't know how many manger scenes I passed with Jesus in a baby in a manger. You've seen them. But you know, today, if you really want to do an accurate PORTRAYAL OF WHERE CHRIST WAS, you'd have to go out and lay in the yard yourself. &gt;&gt; Christ, the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED. AMEN. A predestinated chosen body of people on the earth that knows what he wants DONE WITH HIS WORD. NOT GOD ABOVE US. NOT JUST GOD WITH US, BUT GOD IN US, THE HOPE OF GLORY. CHRIST IN YOU, CHRIST IN ME, THE HOPE OF GLORY. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this, "What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" &gt;&gt; The temple of God, the temp, you know, the dwelling place of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; What agreement hath the dwelling place OF GOD WITH IDOLS? FOR YE ARE THE TEMPLE of the living God, &gt;&gt; as God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE. Notice that God's desire is not just to be with his people. But he wants to be in his people. &gt;&gt; For he said, I will not DWELL WITH THEM, BUT I WILL DWELL IN THEM. AND I WILL NOT WALK WITH THEM, BUT I WILL WALK IN THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; God the creator walking in his creation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T STAGGER INTO THIS MESSAGE, FRIENDS. GOD PREDESTINATED YOU &gt;&gt; FOR this time. The hour has come. The season &gt;&gt; of recognition. &gt;&gt; This season, this hour, THIS TIME, BRIDE TIME. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET NEVER EVEN SAID BRIDE TIME TO THE LATER part of 60s. 64 I believe it was something like that the middle of ' 64 that he started talking about a bride time. &gt;&gt; God wanted to EXPRESS HIMSELF IN A BODY of believers called the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the manifested Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory. The great manifested God in Christ. Now Christ manifested in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look, what was once God's great secret, God's great mysterious secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believers. That is the body of Christ. What was God's once great secret in his mind before the foundation of the world is now made manifest. Now, WHERE WHERE IS IT MADE MANIFEST? In you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the Welch revival? And they went over to find out this revival, to find out what's going on. And they saw a policeman standing on the street corner and they went to that policeman to find out where the Welch revival was. Now, I want you to understand, they didn't go to the policeman and ask directions because he was a policeman. &gt;&gt; And when they went to him and said, "Sir, WHERE IS THE WELCH REVIVAL?" HE NEVER SAID, "GO two blocks, turn right, turn left, there's a library. Behind the library, there's a storefront. That's where you'll find it." He never GAVE THEM A GPS LOCATION. &gt;&gt; But when they said, "SIR, WE'RE HUNGRY. WHERE IS THE WELCH REVIVAL?" YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID? YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT. &gt;&gt; NOW, why did they go TO HIM? NOT BECAUSE he is a policeman, BUT HE WAS STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER SINGING A GOSPEL SONG. &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't talking about the revival. HE WAS MANIFESTING THE REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TALK ABOUT THE TOKEN. YOU MUST NOW APPLY THE TOKEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. OH, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Where is it made manifest? In his bride. Then God would manifest in one man. God would manifest in one man. Now he's manifested in an entire church universal &gt;&gt; all over the world. The body of Christ is represented all over the world. And what does that do? It makes St. John 14:12 and it vindicates it to be the truth. For Jesus said, "The works I do shall you do also, and greater works than this shall you do." Now, you can't do nothing greater that open blinded eyes and raised the dead. So, what was he saying? All the things that took place in Jesus day, it was in his body, ONE MAN DOING THESE MIRACLES. BUT NOW, it's a universal BRIDE AROUND THE WORLD and over in Africa and down in South Africa and down in Tennessee AND HERE IN GEORGIA. GOD IS DOING GREAT THINGS. WHY? IT'S A UNIVERSAL BRIDE. MORE WORKS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE it's a many member bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And say, look, if I'm the if I'm the foot of the body of this bride, if I'm his body represent and I'm the foot, if I'm the bottom, if I where the little toe meets the foot and that if that's what I am, I'm still in the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even if that's who I am, if that's who I am IN THE BODY OF CHRIST, EVERY DEVIL IS STILL UNDER MY FEET. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LOWER. LOWER. Stomp Satan. Lower. &gt;&gt; Amen. God wouldn't manifest in one man. Now he's manifested in the entire church universal. EVERYWHERE. GOD CAN WORK THROUGH EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN &gt;&gt; that'll open up their heart &gt;&gt; and let the Lord Jesus come in and work his will through them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. &gt;&gt; How did he Can I have just a few more minutes? Look, how did he identify the bridegroom on the earth? He sent a messenger with the spirit of Elijah upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then how will he how will he announce the bride on the earth? It'll be a be a messenger with the spirit of Elijah upon him. &gt;&gt; For the same word speaks for the groom SPEAKS ALSO FOR THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; LOOK, last year we had a eclipse. Remember I think it was around April the 10th we had an eclipse and I was down in Hardy, Arkansas because that's where it was a 100%. And if you're at a 100% where the eclipse is, it's total darkness. So we preached a meeting down there and then on that Monday we stood over to watch the eclipse. And when it when that moon and that sun became one, it was total darkness where we were standing. &gt;&gt; Turkeys begin to gobble. Roosters was roosting. &gt;&gt; It's the craziest thing you ever seen. You could look out on the horizon and see light, but right there where we was at WAS DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; AND AS I STOOD THERE, you know, you couldn't had to have these special glasses, but once the moon covered the sun, you could take the glasses off and just look at it. It was phenomenal. How many knows what I'm talking about? It came through here a few years ago. And I was standing there looking at that moon. Now, the prophet said the moon is the type of the church and the sun is the type of Christ. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I It just struck me. I got so happy that when the moon and the sun become one, there was darkness on the earth. &gt;&gt; When Christ and his church becomes one, it's in the Leosa age. Amen. &gt;&gt; The age of gross darkness when the two become one. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S COMING. I TELL YOU, IT'S HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. The mystery of God should be finished and declared to his servants, the prophets. Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's MYSTERY IN CHRIST. MARY was a human incubator. She carried the holy child and brought him to birth. It was a God man. He was the son of God. He was a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined. &gt;&gt; He was the first of a new race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; He is the head of the new race. Well, if there's a head, there got to be a body. &gt;&gt; What good's a body without a head? What good's a head without a body? &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the head of a new race. And he's the head of the body of the church, who is the beginning, THE FIRSTBORN FROM THE DEAD, THAT IN ALL THINGS HE MIGHT HAVE THE PREEMINENCE. THEREFORE, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things are come become new. There can see though that that the old man was of the old order of a creation. NOW IN UNION WITH CHRIST, HE HAS BECOME a new creation of God. You see, Satan has no ability to create. He can pervert, but he can't create. ONLY GOD CAN CREATE. SO, this new race &gt;&gt; must come from the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Created in union with Christ Jesus, unto good works, oh God. Ephesians 4:24. and that ye put on the new man &gt;&gt; which after God is created in righteousness &gt;&gt; and true holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A season when the head and the body unites. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, do you see the hours come? &gt;&gt; This is who we are. We've come into a new year. &gt;&gt; It's the hour of the manifestation of who we are. &gt;&gt; We don't have to pump it up. We don't have to work it up. We just live it. &gt;&gt; You just live it. It'll manifest itself through you. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; A new creation, a new race. &gt;&gt; A God man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said Jesus was all man. He was all God. He was a man when he wept in the garden. &gt;&gt; But when he threw his shoulders back and said, "Lazarus, come forth." That was MORE THAN A MAN. THAT WAS GOD. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A MAN WHEN HE'S SLEEPING ON THE BOAT, TIRED FROM PREACHING. BUT WHEN HE PUT HIS FOOT ON THE BOW OF THE BOAT AND SAID, "PEACE BE STILL." THAT WAS GOD IN A MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SEE, my brother, my sister, that's what his desire has been all along. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; To walk in us &gt;&gt; to live in us. For what is true fellowship? Two fellows &gt;&gt; in the same ship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Can you see it, my brother, my sister? &gt;&gt; God, help us this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Help us this morning. And what does it take? &gt;&gt; What does it take for this to manifest in us? A surrendered life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just something yielded. &gt;&gt; Something yielded that he can work his work through. As I said yesterday, God don't need something big. He just needs something yielded. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him today? &gt;&gt; Do you see your hour? Don't you see the critics rising up? &gt;&gt; It's the season for it. &gt;&gt; Look, I I'll close with this, but look, when Jesus was here and he started his ministry, the Bible says he was glorified by all. &gt;&gt; Is that not true? &gt;&gt; In three years and six months, it come from being glorified by all to the point they hated him &gt;&gt; till they killed him. That's &gt;&gt; right. in a short season. &gt;&gt; They went from loving him to hating him &gt;&gt; to criticizing him to calling him a devil and a false prophet. &gt;&gt; They rejected him. They rejected his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what came next? The resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. that we're living in an hour that all of a sudden I've been in this message a long time, but I have never seen this message abused and criticized &gt;&gt; than it is right now. &gt;&gt; This believe the sign and all these things that people are doing and all this hate and all this and that if I don't know if you saw it or not, but somebody went up to brother Bram's grave and wrote all kinds of nasty words on it. Did you see that? Desseecrated his grave. It's the hour that we're living in. Don't you see the final rejection of his word is his bride? And when they reject this bride, &gt;&gt; what comes next? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you see where we're at in time, friends? It's here. The season is here. The time has come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel the birth pains. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I feel the going home pains. &gt;&gt; Oh, are you ready? &gt;&gt; There's Listen, listen to me, young people. There is nothing. There is nothing in this nation worth missing this rapture over. &gt;&gt; There's not enough money. There's not enough. &gt;&gt; Get under his wings. &gt;&gt; Hide yourself under his wings. The hour has come in a little while. Oh my. Let's be ready. &gt;&gt; God, give me more love. &gt;&gt; Give me more power. More of you &gt;&gt; in my life. Do you love him today? &gt;&gt; Do you believe him today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God sent this message to find you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah, "They shall be called the sought out." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sought out. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We shall be called the sought out. &gt;&gt; Who do you reckon's looking for us? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom looking for &gt;&gt; his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Oh, God. May the Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Oh God, how I love you, Lord. How I feel your presence on me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. More love, more power, more of you in my life. More love. More power, more of you in my life. And I will worship you with all of my heart. And I will worship you with all of my mind. And I will worship you with all of my strength. For you are my Lord. Lord, more love, more power, more of you in my life. More love, more power, more of you in my life. And I will worship you with all of my heart. And I will worship you with all of my mind. And I will worship you with all of my strength. For you are my Lord. Oh Lord Jesus. God, it's our hunger today, God. &gt;&gt; We don't want the world, Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't want the world order. We don't want the things of the world. It's you we hunger for, Lord. That anointing, that real rain that is to fall upon us to bring forth fruit. Oh God, help us, Lord God, in this hour when everything is turning against us. Lord, yet you said, "I'll never leave thee, nor will I forsake thee." Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will be with you. Oh God, we are so grateful, Lord, of this hour that these mysteries, these great things that you hid in your mind, Lord, has now been placed into our hearts that we may manifest it back upon our flesh that the world may know you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. I'm so glad my children don't have to go back to 65 and find you doing miracles and signs and wonders. But today, the hour that we're LIVING IN, MY CHILDREN are witness of miracles and signs and wonders and these things. Lord, we don't seek after them. We don't follow signs, but they do follow us, Lord God. And we are grateful today to be a part of the economy of God. And Lord, as we come into this new year, God, let this be the year of consecration, of more dedication, of service, Lord, to lay into your presence, to ripen in the presence of the sun. Oh God, grant it, Lord. Bless this church. Let a revival strike this church, LORD. LET IT STRIKE this little community of Lula, Lord. that'll strike this PART OF GEORGIA THAT THAT LAST seed can be found, Lord, because we know when that last one comes in, you'll close the book and call for your bride. Oh, Father, until then, let us labor, Lord. Oh, Father, let us labor. God, we don't have to manifest the light, but let us bear that light, Lord Jesus. Let it reflect through us, Lord, that the world may know that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Bless your children today, Lord. We pray if you're here, friends. If that's your desire today, why don't you just lift your hands up to him and say, "Lord, Lord, this new year, God, I want to rededicate. I want to reconsecrate myself to you, Lord. Oh, Father, many walked away this year, but I'm still here, Lord. I'm still believing, oh God. I lift my heads to you, Lord, today. More love, more power, more of you in my life, oh God. That's what I need, God. That's all I need, Lord. That's all I need, Lord, is you, God. Come today, Lord. I open up my heart to you. I receive it today, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, I pray for those that are afflicted today. The sick that are among us in the name of Jesus. May the anointing of God move upon them today, Lord. Let the sickness leave them. Let the affliction leave them. Let the weariness leave them. Let the oppression and the depression, let it leave them today in the name OF JESUS CHRIST. WE ARE NOT CHILDREN OF DARKNESS. WE ARE THE children of light. Amen. And we are your people. You are our God. Amen. We are your people. We are your people and you are our God. And we love you, Lord. And we worship you, God. And we receive you today in the name of Jesus. Oh God, bless Brother Way, Lord. Use him, God. Use him for your glory. Anoint these other ministers here, Lord, as they travel through Central America, different parts of the world. Use them, oh God. I pray in the name of Jesus. Oh God, may we not have to point to somewhere where the revival is, but may we be like that POLICEMAN AND SAY WE ARE THE BRIDE'S REVIVAL. Oh God, not just a rain, but the real rain. Oh God, the real rain to a vindicate that the message is right. Grant it Lord God. Grant it Lord in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Go brother sing us something brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. soul.

It shall forever more endure the saints that &gt;&gt; Oh, can we worship him just for a minute? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The love of the God is greater. That time for can never tell. It goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, bow down with him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. to win through his child. He reconcile and pardon us from sin.

Love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless. Amen. And strong. reach out forever more endure the saints and a shallow. Amen. Brother Joe, let's sing more of you. Can you hear more of you? We got more of you. More of you. more of you. &gt;&gt; A second before. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh we got more of you on the on the uh on the list. More of you. I want more of you. Is that our Is that our prayer? Is that our plea? I want more preaching like I want to hear. The only way you going to hear right there more of you today, this hour, this day is the day of salvation. This is the day that's coming. Noah was preaching 120 years. And like I said the other day, he expected it to rain. &gt;&gt; Well, his expectation came to pass. &gt;&gt; It did rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what about it, though? Only eight people went in. 120 years. Brother Daryl, sometimes we get disappointed because people don't want to hear us. What about preaching for 120 years the same message and you get no results except one day God comes on the scene and says, "Get in the ark." This is all that's going to hear me. This is it. And that's what's going to happen. When we come to this day that God's going to shut the door on the Gentile church, there'll be no one else saved. That'll be it. Whoever's in's in. Whoever's out is out. Everybody with me? Every person has got a seat on that ark. If you will expect that you have a seat on that ark, God's given us a way. And through preaching, through fellowshipping, I cannot see how somebody would sit at home and try to make have a service. I just can't see that. We are sheep. We need to be together. We need fellowship. We need to feed off each other. Everybody with me? Feed off each other. The highs, the lows, the ins and outs, the ups and downs. Sometimes, you know, you may be up and your brother and sister may be down. Or you may be down and your brother and sister may be up. Well, that's why we bind together and we bring everybody into the fold and we try our best to love God with all of our heart. But you know how to love. It's just like brotherh Manuel was saying today. They asked Jesus. They said, "What's the two of the greatest commandments, right?" He said, "Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and love thy neighbor as thyself." These are two of the greatest commandments. Why? Because if you can love your brother or your neighbor as much as you do you, you're doing a good thing. Think about that. Love your neighbor just as you love yourself. That's the love of God. Can we say it now? What I need is more of you. I've had but yet I hunger still worshiping. There's a wonderful atmosphere today. Get what you need. Get it today for more of you. You sing it to me. Let that be your desire. More. Yes. More of you. I want more of you. Oh, I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. Hey, listen. I've had enough of this world. I've had my fill of this world. I want the heavenly things that God has got for us and to give us right now. Heavenly places while we're still standing in hell. What a miracle. Sing it to him. You're a miracle where you're standing today. I want more of you. Grant it, Lord. I want more of you. I I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. Oh, sing it to him. Of things I've had in my field. Oh, but yet I hunger still. Here we are, empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. One more time, sing it to him. I want more of you. Let that be your prayer. I want more of you. Oh, I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. Yes, Lord. Amen. Grant it. of things I've had my fear. But yet I hunger still empty and bad. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. Amen. God wants to have the preeminence. The only way you can have the preeminence is to have more of him. You remember you know what preeminence is? Preeminence mean you put him before everything else. And that's what he that's why I want you to read Christ the mystery of God revealed. And he he quoted about three pages of it just a few minutes ago if you're realizing it. That's where he was uh he was preaching from. So, but we're going to um we're going to start there because if listen, if we don't know that it's Christ in us, you'll never know what a seal is. &gt;&gt; You'll be sealed out of any revelation without the seal of God in your heart. And that's just the way God works. But you know what? God said, I'm going to do it in simplicity. I'm going to let a seventh grade prophet that can't hardly speak good English. I'm going to send it through him so that every person little or big can understand what he's saying and make it so simple that even the common people. Now listen, the son of man ministry was what? Jesus Christ on earth in in human flesh. And the Bible said the common people heard him gladly. Not the hierarchy, not even the religious world. The common people heard him gladly. And that's us. We're just common people. But we got a message that's so powerful. One day it's going to absolutely change your body. And the words that you speak out of your mouth is going to raise the dead. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; The word you're going to speak. I was thinking as brother brother Daryl was was was speaking, I thought, Lord, you're in his mind and he's speaking what you told him to what you told him to speak. But it's happening in a split second. I mean, a split second. &gt;&gt; In the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, we're going to be changed. Listen, why not start now a little bit at a time? Let's change a little bit at a time. And then one day, we're going to be changed and got and raptured out of this place. Tell Brother Daryl how much you appreciate it. Very timely message. Very wonderful message. Very timely. And we sure appreciate him. Like I said before, he he us he starts our year out. Wonderful. And just pray for him as he heads back home and and up there with brother Donnie and helps him out. Puts his shoulder to the wheel there and and uh he's been to Lord, he's been to 30 something countries. I don't know if some of you know his testimony, but he went to the he got in the army to see the world and they put him in like Fort Bragg uh North Carolina or somewhere and he never got out overseas. But now since he got in the right army, &gt;&gt; since he got in the right army 30 years ago, he's been in 30 something different countries and and they're calling him all the time wanting him to go to those countries. So God works in mysterious ways. Amen. God bless you. Love you with the love of the Lord. Remember the uh Yes. &gt;&gt; Can I get a pray for &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Come on. Now, Brother Roger is Sister Cleleta's son-in-law, okay? He's married to Chi. And uh actually, I talked to Lauren the other day. She's doing okay. Trying to get her to come to church, but he has uh he's going to have open heart surgery. Now, this is one man standing here today. How many of y'all had open heart surgery? I didn't think so. &gt;&gt; This one has. &gt;&gt; Canard, &gt;&gt; and he's went through it. and Anna Canard already has at home, but he knows more than anything the struggle &gt;&gt; of an open heart surgery. So, we're going to pray. &gt;&gt; We're going to pray number one that God will touch his soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heal his soul first. Give me my heart transplant. &gt;&gt; I fish with the fish, not for fish. &gt;&gt; That's fish for him. Fishers of men. That's right. Well, we're going to pray that God's going to change him and then help the doctors if he has to go through it just like we did with brother Boyd. Bless those hands, Lord. Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, Lord, where our brother stands here today. Lord, we know brother Roger, Lord, and we've known him for a while. Father, I pray that you would be with him and bless him. He's a wonderful man to be around. Father, we pray that you'd touch his heart, Lord, the real heart, the one that the doctor's not going to touch, but Dr. Jesus, you can touch his real heart. And Father, I pray that you'd be with the doctors as they perform the surgery, Lord. And that he'll come out of it, Lord, and be a better person, Father. Lord, show him as maybe this is something to tell him that he needs to get right with you, Father, and that that will happen, Lord. And our brother, Lord, I pray that you give Brother Boyd and ones that hang around him, Lord, the the wisdom to speak the words to him, Lord, that he'll come back to you, Father. I pray these things in Jesus name. Amen. Believe that you just hang around him. Amen. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, God will let somebody go through something. so that they can be a witness for another person. Could have let brother Boyd go through this. You think, "Boy, that's horrible." That's the way my God works. Amen. He'll let you go through a trial and a tribulation just so you can be what? An example and be a testimony of the test that you took. So sometimes we uh Paul says, "I glory in my infirmity." Why? because he wanted to show the people that God could heal you of anything. That's what um I'll tell you this real quick what brother u um Daryl was telling about me about the surgery. This man, his his bowels had blown up and he was just absolutely gone. They had to take big sections of it out and and he had, you know, all kind of infection and all that stuff and they opened him up and and brother Daryl said he was standing in the in the operating room and he's like something came over him. You know what the doctor stood there and said he will never make it. He is not going to live. And brother Daryl was in his mind. He was thinking, you know, boy, this is bad because he's looking he's looking at this man's whole insides is completely rotten. He said something came over him and said, "Is there anything too hard for God?" And that man lived 10 more years. Brother Daryl prayed with him and and I'm sure he, you know, just being in Listen, being in the room with a believer sometimes is the greatest thing you'll ever have. Hello, somebody. You say, "Well, I don't feel that way." Hey, well, you better get something in your heart to feel that way. Amen. Cuz believers love believers. &gt;&gt; Amen. We love our believers. We love the people that believe with us. And as we stand, as we stand today as the bride of Jesus Christ, as he said back there, we are going to be an invincible army. Satan will not be able to stand against this bride. I believe that cuz I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it looks bad." Who who asked you about what he looked like when Jesus Christ hung on the cross? That was the worst, awful, pitiful thing you could ever see in your life. But it was the greatest thing that ever happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was beginning to be the what? Firstborn from the dead. The beginning of the creation of God. The beginning of this new race. You and I are a part of that new race. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Today we are. That's what we're going to be speaking on. He didn't know that in a couple weeks cuz you're part of this. If you're not a part of this new race, then you're not going to understand the seals. But the seals are for you. The seals, as as brother Richard Wilson said, this message is summed up in one sentence. God and man are one. That's what brother Brandham wanted us to see was that God and man was one. Not God and man too. God and man was one. &gt;&gt; That's right. We are the bride of Jesus Christ. That makes us God made manifest in another form. I didn't make myself that. God did. God said he'd have somebody stand on the earth that would believe him. So, he had to send us a prophet to turn us into the right direction. And I believe he has. I believe we're heading in the right direction. So, God bless you. Love you with the love of the Lord. Let's bow our heads and be dismissed. Just remember us. They're coming up here Wednesday and and then regular service next Sunday and it will be probably regular for the next uh until uh February when we have the banquet with brother Eric here. Uh we'll be speaking a good bit because we want to bring out some things on the seals that will help us through the year. So dear heavenly father, Lord, thank you for this day. Lord, I pray number one for our servant, Lord, that spoke to us today. That you'd give him strength, Father. That you would give him, Lord, um safe travel back home, Lord. And that you will bless each person that's in this building, Lord. That we've received something today from an eternal God. And I pray, Lord, that it will become part of us and we'll live it, Father, instead of just trying to remember it. Lord, we'll live it. It'll live through each and every one of us, Father. Just be with the ones that are sick, the ones that are not here, Sister Rebecca, and different ones that that sickness has come upon. And I pray that you'd break that spirit, Father. That you would break us, Lord, that spirit of there, Lord. I didn't mention, but Terrence and Lisa and all them, they have the they have the um bug and stomach bug. And Father, I pray that you'd that you'd bless them, Father, right now in the name of the Lord Jesus, that you'd take all that away from each one, Lord, cuz we've all been through that and we're a witness so we can enter in, Lord, and ask you, Lord, that you would take them, Lord, and and raise our body up, Lord, get rid of that virus in all of us. I pray that that you would bless each one now. Lord, heal the sick. Lord, I mean the sin sick. Lord, it's time that Noah preached. It's going to rain. Well, as our brother said, the prophet of God brought us a message and now the real rain is beginning to fall. Father, be with us now as we continue on home and we come back together on Wednesday night. Father, just bless each one. Thank you for being with us today and with our brother. We ask your blessings in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. Go with the Lord. I am blessed. I am every day that I live. I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning, when I lay my head to rest, I am blessed. I am blessed through the sunshine and rain and even sorrows my pain. Jesus still is my comfort in God. And his love comforts me. Oh, and his grace has set me free. And someday I shall stand by his son. And I am blessed. Oh, I'm so blessed. So blessed. Every day that I live, I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning, when I lay my head to rest, I am blessed. I am blessed and I help you for my feet. And I have many toe and a home up in heaven by and brothers and sisters on this earth. They are my
