for the atonement to be made of it for those that are sick among us and just have your way blessed and it's only these families are in the loss of the loved one and just be with each one we love you and we thank you got us in Jesus name Amen 1st Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again and what a process going on being born again how not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible one that then has nothing to do with your seed of what you are what this is or what you're born and of course why this is what it said by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever so that's the main thing is the Word of God ok we'll go over to 2nd Peter 1 Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue or by are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the of on nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through us and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ I mean you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word brother Tony and him doesn't have any arrangements yet so we will get to that when the arrangements were made okay now I've been speaking on trying to get us to the position to where we could follow in the the lineup of understanding the stature of a perfect man all right and doing that we're trying to date to move a little bit into it and you know if you get bored of me speaking about these things evidently they're not as invaluable as valuable to you as they are to me so because that's the thing that that I want to make sure or that we all understand but now I'm not saying this and or no reflections or nothing's nothing to me because you'll hear me say things sometimes that you wonder why I say them but I'm just plain and I'm just blunt so that's the best way to be and that way you don't misunderstand me see there was a doctrine back years ago on second Peter of the stature of a perfect man and the doctrine was that you did not have these virtues you could not get these virtues until you know you would not be born again until you reach the height of the statue of a perfect man and receives a headstone well I've never been able to follow that I'm serious I don't argue with nobody back oh they know been native arguing it's not gonna solve any time will I bless God I got my point across well then you know you know what you're doing you got your point across what good is it you know what but there weren't that doctrine went among the people of the message and is still prevalent especially in the overseas feel that these things are still being taught and they've put out a lot of different points on it but I've tried to make my stand at that time to the same that I do now I believe what the Prophet taught us you know because that's the only way that we had to know what things are is by the prophets message that he has brought unto us and then that way you know we come to a place of having understanding and we've spent a couple of messages talking about one especially on how that we Peter is saying to these people here that I have this faith and I'm addressing this to people that has that faith so whatever faith Peter had he's addressing the message to the people that have that same faith so then you say well we don't have the faith of the Apostles well why not you know why not why can't we say we have the faith of the Apostles all right now Heights and growth and development adoptions and things like that or different things our way of progressiveness but everybody must be born again there's no way of bypassing any of these things all right and I tried to get you to see and we'll we'll make it this away this morning to where you see where I'm heading I believe that Peter and Paul brother branham said preach the same thing now if you take Paul and read him he covers a lot of thoughts in pre destinations and uncovering the Romans you know of the adoptions and things and he covers it in that line whereas Peter covers it in this growth development or the stature are what we need to have to bring these things into manifestation what I believe that I believe that Paul and Peter preached the same thing I believe brother Branham preached what they did you know I believe he brought to us the understanding that Paul and Peter was bringing are trying to bring back guard alright and in doing that then I believe that to be and I believe then true that by the Prophet bringing that message to us you know all right then we can move on in the Lord and it will we'll finalize in the finishing up with these things one day in the rapture all right and believing then the fivefold ministry is according to what the Bible says and the Prophet said it's for the perfecting of the saints or bringing these virtues into the body of Christ I believe that and that that puts it to her that we have a five fold ministry as the Prophet said these young men take this and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord all right now I've heard a your lot of you listen to a lot of things on him but I don't but some people every once in a while send me a tape and I listen and things and I heard one man on a tape car and he was emphatically declaring that he believed in the fivefold ministry and he believed it cause he was part of the fivefold ministry all right yes oh well that's good then but then I played another time with a sign man preaching another time and he said brother Branham was the fivefold ministry well now I don't know which one he's saying to be right I'm just telling you you need to listen to what you're listening to you might find out if you listen a little while you might find out these people are saying a lot of things you don't understand but that ain't gonna do it because it doesn't matter to me it wouldn't matter to me if every minister in this message declared that we had to only play the types of the Prophet you know in the services that wouldn't change me that wouldn't change me none whatsoever post on I believe in the fivefold ministry but I believe now this is what I do believe you know I believe brother Branham could fulfill any office in the film industry I believe that because of the position he was in and what he was doing and he done those things he done everything he said it was even a deacon he said he was he was everything and he could do those things I believe that all right but then after his passing on now it's delivered to the ministry to where the minister is to take that and only preach what he preached all right so then that gets into the category with a lot of things going on today that you don't agree with you know but that's all right what does it matter what does it make any difference who police want whether later that you know they believe this they believe what do you believe and I think we were to just stand on what we believe and say that that's it you know good or bad as far as is doing and I believe then that there is to be in this last days of finishing up of all things all right then we'll read that this morning when we get down to it of what the Prophet said but I want you to think about what we were talking about that Peter said of those of like precious faith in other words he said I've got it we read it from the profit I've got this faith and I'm addressing this to those that have this fight well now that's what's your prophet say it well I don't believe so I don't care what you believe I'm you ask me say brother what do you think this is what the Prophet says it so that solves it with me I don't have any ain't gonna argue with you about it but you ask me I will just tell you what do you think we have the faith of the father's I believe in the Bride of Christ somewhere around the world is the faith of the father because according to the Bible and according to the Prophet it has never been to a position to where that God ever left the earth there has always been God dwelling among mankind and no matter what you would say about what I don't think this is isn't it that ain't got none do it Hebrews 13:8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever so then he said he ever was here he's still here alright now that's Bible that's what I was telling my wife the other day I don't understand people you know I thought the Bible said you know and I thought that was what it was supposed to be I thought that was what is far well how come as quick as you see these people backslide you know quick as you see them turn against the message what do they do they start cutting the hair painting the face and wearing the wrong clothes and going to the world men and women why do you do that the Bible tells us not to do that well I had a prophet he the probably left me a word he met you love he told you what the Bible says the Bible wide it is it shows there's something wrong with the interior part of the being that is making the things and they're just going and showing they should they ought to walk out a long time before then but they stayed with it to to where as long as it was working and then they got their own things and then how they ought to end the Prophet was wrong here the Prophet was wrong dark you know this will well all right I think I'd have to do with Loula Georgia and he's got nothing to do with what I believe cuz I believe the message because that's what I want you to think about today Paul and Peter said the same thing brother Branham said to sign time Paul and Peter said would you agree all right now the fivefold ministry is supposed to say the same thing the Prophet said now I agree with one thing that there's a lot of people that called herself thoughtful ministry I'm not gonna put them in any category of trying to say they're following what the Prophet said now I'm with you now whether we don't still go throw stones cause remember either throw he that lives in glass house but he that lives in glass house don't throw stones that's a pretty good way of doing it all right but see Peter was saying I have this faith and I'm delivering this to people that have this same faith all right now that solves the problem then you said well is there ever there has never been an age now listen there has never been an age that God was not in that age right come on now there's never been an age that God wouldn't in that age there's never been an age that it was not the Holy Ghost in each searching there's never been an age that there wasn't a group of people that had the Neuwirth I'm talking about after calvary i have to receive an old ago coming down it's never been an age it's always been the baptism with Holy Ghost in their age and those of like precious faith right so they had the same faith Peter had now not the growth development that's the thing we'll have to get through not the growth development of what Peter in them was doing but the same faith the same new birth I listened over a couple of times to the last messages and I was driving hard and I'm driving hard now if you have the new birth if you have the bad when the Holy Ghost this day you have the same life precious faith that Peter was talking about if not what do you have you know what do you have if you don't have it well I just don't see it I think I do it it's hard for me to stand here now I'm serious it's hard for me to stand here and look back at the dark ages and see those people dying like crazy but yet realizing that was the Holy Spirit in those people that was doing that right that was God in those people and they were dying to where we could come forth right but they were waiting on us that's brother Leticia's quit our Wednesday night I enjoy this message and you know but the point I wanted him to continue on was the fact that you you talk about you know EJ's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost DJ's got the pity you know they're great hood well why would anybody be upset about any other age getting more than that God now we got the new bird I'm serious this is this is my point I'm sorry well here we have all of us have the baptism and hole goes in these Church age well what if God give one Church edge a little more than the other because of the situation's of the way they existed or whatever are the harder times or the thing what would I be upset you mean I just get in you understand that sorry now I'm gonna preach this anyway yeah I just get in the body I get the new birth I get my penny I get my pay why don't I be upset with somebody getting more what would make me get upset because that brother Kali would get two pennies you know her whatever it was what would I say to that I thank God that he gave in there I mean I thank God down through the ages that we look at those things and you look at it the way the Prophet bring those ages coming down was marvelous to me to always mean so marvelous to think of how God could come on the scene and each one of those ages and do the things he done I'm just saying plain language if anybody is not happy with a penny they get then they didn't get a penny you did not get the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're not satisfied with what you got well I think we ought to have more words what what would be the reason why would you not want everybody else to have more than you've got right why would you not want people to have more than what you like we're talking buddy you know in eternal life and in in do it why would not we be so happy that that gets me I've just charged my soul out to think about people that they get upset because well I don't want we know God's been better to them people are he he wouldn't over here he wouldn't know with our listen Church those spirits and things better get gone because they are not of God right why wouldn't we be happy for somebody else to make it for me to see that you made it and I miss it that's no problem I told you about it I had a dream just tell the dream is a dream I had a dream one time and I've seen all of you make it and I turned around and went back you know what I was happy I didn't go away crying and pouting and because that's just the way I am I want you to be there I want you to have everything you can have God pours it all on you and don't give me nothing but the I got the eternal life right that's that's just me I'm sorry all right but listen see those of like precious faith the same new birth in each age every age had the new birth that is the light precious faith then we start we brought it on up a little bit further in second theater to the divine nature that's what we're talking about an afternoon sir the divine nature of God the whole entire period is the divine nature of God it starts at faith that's the divine nature that gives us a very nature the very life of Almighty God His divine nature given into our hearts to make us his children when we don't deserve any of it but he gave these days and each time down through their part of his divine nature building the pyramid as it comes forth and goes on into all right the divine nature well I just don't see it well see that's you know a lot of people get up in the morning I guess and they say well I tell you what I don't see the Sun coming up with this you know you think it's gonna stop now I've always tried to explain this one time faith faith can bring light into being but unbelieving don't put light out I've always tried to explain that that's a carnal way of saying it but it's true darkness your unbelief is not gonna put out God you can pout in your novela mouth all you want that ain't gonna change God but your faith can increase as you see God living this is the day that we should be thinking about the greatest of all as you and I have year come to a place to work that we're facing stepping over into eternity well they said that all alone I've heard that and the first come into message well you still gonna hear today cause it's true somebody's gonna walk off this earth in a change of the body well you know while we're gonna do cause God said it that's the ninth time God said it was gonna be that way that's gonna be that away our on belief ain't gonna do it our own beliefs ain't you ain't gonna keep the Sun from coming up it's going to I've set out after all you want to sit I don't believe this coming up it's gonna come on up so this don't waste your time okay now back in that part trying to get it to us to a position to where we could understand I want to emphasize this over and over to us because of what I'm saying the doc turn was back there that we only have this some kind of a of work of God among us and and things that was called many different things but the the new birth is the new birth well we did you you know you claim that as the new burden people now the Prophet said it it's not what me and you say it's what the prophet said and the Prophet said what the what Peter said and Peter said what Paul said and Paul said what God said so now I feel pretty good way of lining it up you know so as long as we say what he's saying let's see what is it in the church a book where it says that the the fivefold ministry they don't they don't know how is it stated they don't in other words they don't honor the Word of God and believe God's Word to her even I mean I believe that I see that I see it among the the day in our that we're living so you know that as that's going on but just remember to one thing if we can see the devil working why can't we realize what God is doing why is the devil doing that they had to come up into the message and see the message in the point of their natural things before they could fall away you can't fall off of the house do you get upon it well see then that's the point of what I'm trying to get us to follow into that so now I want to make sure you follow that with a lineup like this those of like precious faith all right now go ahead and pull up number one so we read these other day in parts of them and all but I want to make sure he said having escaped the corruption of the world having escaped that the lust and the corruption of the world you're above that now who's just talking to those of like precious faith and the lust of the corruption of the world you're above that now now that's the type of person that he's talking to the person that has escaped these things see the corruption of the world you realize the new birth what it has done for you in that soul that you have within you is eternal life the very life of Almighty God living within us we can't die we've already died we died to ourselves and accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior why should we worry about things no there's no no problem that wrote it on that well this is what we'll get back to in a little bit now he has given us the outline here what to do he's giving us the outline of what to do Peters give it to us add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience caught in this really kind of charity know how to do it as I said we're all trying to come closer to God that's why I chose this message this morning the church knowing the people are traveling the different thing oh well what's he saying Peter is giving us an outline of how to come closer to God what you see we we we still put it well I just don't see it what does that mean God's not doing it is your tab of unbelief going to stop god I just don't I just don't see it I don't see the faith of heart I've tried to explain a lot of things to people and I know I get in trouble trying to explain but I do it to do it for the heping of you and I'll just keep on do anything you know I wonder what would happen if you took the book of Acts the people in the book of Acts and put us them in our day do you realize Jesus only faced the Sadducees Pharisees and the Herodians a couple of little groups right you realize that first church only faced two or three doctrinal issues and thoughts and you bring that down here to where we are right you don't never think about that said Lord how would it be with that church bringing it down Oh they've just me that they do do mm-hmm they'd be fighting like everything I like what one man said one time you know he's talking about Sid if he's talking about if Paul will hear he'd do this if Paul was here he'd do that if Paul was here and his brother was and said if Paul was here he'd how the best car he'd have a big Cadillac he'd have a big church he'd have a big this and big that you know I'm always sarcastic I know what I'm sorry but I said it like this when he finally hushed for a little bit I said if Paul was here he'd be in jail before midnight that's the best way to say he'd be in jail just a little bit huh but listen Church listen to what your prophet is saying do we believe in moon down to number two and start on the earth did my whole subject is based upon faith right you don't know he's saying that I have obtained this faith and I'm addressing this to them that have has obtaining the like precious faith I want it's not to the outside world it's to the church see those that are in Christ now how much clearer could it be how much plainer could it be what the Prophet is saying right okay yeah then think about it think about what he's saying the world we would escape that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is God's requirements there's not a person in here that loves God but wants to wants to be come more like Christ now it's laid out here what every Christian laid out to me how to be more like Christ the statue of a perfect man is laying out how to be cooked more like Christ right it's bringing us to that position he says Peter is outlining something there for us that how to get there Peter's laying out how to get to the Statue of perfect man he's not laying out how to get born again he's addressing it to people that are born again this is addressed to the church those that are in Christ Jesus and on the way you'll be in Christ Jesus is what baptized by the baptism with the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ you're in Christ Jesus right and what's it doing but listen now here's what I want you to get to go ahead to number four what I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house and he says you build it for other woods and them's carpenters and all you know I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house right where God can dwell he wants to dwell in you he wants to make you like himself and what did the Prophet come far I remember what we're following Paul Peter said to sign thine brother branham is to say the same thing so now they were telling how to become into the spirit well what's brother Branham doing right so now he's telling us so there's the Bible telling us add to your faith virtue or not attempt replacing them riding it out Paul and Peter said in the signs I brother Branham is saying the same thing well now if the faithful minister said in the same thing that isn't it lined up right you know if not then in other words come and show me where that I've missed what the Prophet is saying but don't come to me with little mealy-mouthed things well I just don't see it I'm gonna tell you go to the pulpit and get I mean to the and get born again oh you can't see without God in you anyway let's see that's not the people ain't gonna do that but they're going to keep their me what is it you know but listen I'm going to tell you how to build your spiritual house he said how are we to build our spiritual health add to your faith virtue and knowledge tempers rolling don't of them and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many like to be that congregation is the dwelling place of the Living God now all right he's what he's come for that do you realize I've made this for 40 years and listen to the point you get fed up with me saying thing forty years is what I've been saying do you realize without God sending a prophet were you and I would be you don't never think like that God what would it be in if you hadn't sent a prophet you realize there was nobody in organized religion teaching and never still and not doing it now teaching the statue of a perfect man I don't like to make things hard but I make them pretty hard do you realize there's an organization out there that 2nd Peter is laid out on the floor in that organization and is teaching you to how to come up the stature of a perfect man you got a ride out over here so it's called a staircase lecture you mean they know more about God than their true church well they're using it to show the stacks or the growth development then you got to go through degrees so now you'll know who what we're talking about okay without this being outlandish if you don't know who that was it's amazing Masonic Lodge Masonic Lodge we'll lay it out on there I've never been there but I've been told it and not just by one but by meaning you know what takes place in those places code I've always been honored by you know I never had no trouble with nobody called I'm going through awful nothing I never told the brothers here to get out of it but now listen and that's why I'm here this morning is try to teach this little church and myself how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God okay then what go ahead to number six I want to get these to where you'll know that what I'm saying at least I'm trying to say what the prophets say it then you can make up your choice about what you believe huh look what he talked about we're not building an organization when I here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by His Word God sent that you see you know you don't listen to me when I'm trying to explain something now Peter was one really original right and he is teaching what Jesus taught him three and a half years right three and I've years I'll keep emphasizing that or you'll think about it they were in their teaching ministry to get them ready for the baptism of the holy ghost three and 1/2 years here comes the Apostle Paul Paul has nobody to teach him that's what he said said no man taught me this time why because he was a prophet I've tried to get you to see what a prophet means a prophet means a way or an opportunity to be able to get into the presence of God right hey I lost my muse you remember in the Bible well go here and do that hey I love so much stole my car right a prophet means an ability or an opportunity to enter into the presence of God you never thought about that of a prophet well here's Paul who taught Paul he went to the backside of the desert spent he said 15 one time another time he says three years or three and a higher studying the Word of God come out preaching the same thing Peter did who talked brother branham letter Brendan went to the backside of the desert just like Paul did and when we wrote around him come out from there he was teaching identically what Paul was teaching and teaching identically what Peter was teaching right see God took him to by himself and told him and gaining the uppity one because it was a promise to you and me Malachi 4 is a promise behold I send you Elijah the prophet it was a promise for him to send that that's the Word of God to be fulfilled right so then that's what he's doing that's what I'm trying to tell you Pross sent me to build individuals okay going to the next I've tried to get this message all of these is from the statue of perfect man in case you don't look down the river like I've tried to get this message over at the Tabernacle to see that these men each member of the tabernacle becomes this it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this is 33 years 33 years the man has tried to get the Branham tabernacle seeing the Word of God right now bring it on down to us by way of tapes and ministries inside right by way of the Prophet 33 years now that's something I need what about a man standing our day in and day out and he said Here I am he said I pour my heart out he said I preached here he said I'll go out and I come back and he said I find a women worse than it was when I left how do you think he felt how do you think he felt brother Ida wouldn't just speaking on women he'd go out and see it and come back and find those people in Wuerffel shape him trying to do everything he couldn't get it to him okay well let's go one more then we'll switch horses in the middle of the stream we in just a minute now now look what he says from the stature of a perfect man lust for money lust for big things lust for popularity these things are dead to the believer we don't care a 10 or a cottage washing up here live or die sinker drowned this is a thing that I'm interested in in the kingdom of God whether I maintain my home whether I maintain my family where I maintain whatever it is let me maintain Christ our hopeful glory beyond me up Oh Lord I listen to it into this let Christ be my head that working through me on my foundation my faith is in him let virtue knowledge temperance patient called it brotherly kindness working me all the Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or swim that's all he desired to do was to teach us the statue of a perfect man now how to come to that we've already preached it so there's no worry I was laying her there they're not thinking ever their home thinking about what God has done for us because I'm serious and you heard me say this and I'll say it again so just go ahead then brother mold finished in 1971 or two right in their preaching on stature of a perfect lamb I asked him a simple question I said okay now we know what we need how do we get it he was serious because I serious then he said I don't know I said I don't either a lot of difference in having a knowledge of something or even knowing that you need something are to be able to say you've got what you need a lot of difference in it he was serious to answer it it was about 82 when God revealed to me what it would take I still believe that more and more today and I'll get to it when I get there how do we get these virtues well I just need Virgil I just have it now your profit if you read the message you heard him say but that's not the way to get it well I got how faith that's how well I did study the magic I'll get it um but listen now where does he go now I've read all of this from there back to try to declare and understand two people that knew that would listen on the internet or whatever you hear it to understand that we believe God promised to send Elijah the Prophet and Elijah the Prophet would come and bring the word unto us and he would have to come into the earth as a human being and grow in grace and knowledge of his own and keep bringing it more and more and more it's like I was showing the other day that brother Branham said I didn't know this would fit in here on this second Peter in other word until I was up in the woods the other day with Charlie and them and God showed me this when he's been teaching it all along you go back to the earth to the fifties and steady the message he was always trying to teach the growth development in Jesus Christ that's what caught me so much to realize that here's a man that had these things but yet always looking for more of God not satisfied with just being here and being there no but he comes out declaring build me up Lord fill me in other words with these things that I may teach others now here's what we're going to have a little chitter chatter for a minute okay but am I going I'm gonna read it and then you can decide what you want to okay look what he says let that work in me let Christ virtues and on his flow out that I might be able to teach those now he declares who's he's gonna teach but do we believe it come on for God has said in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and bring in all these virtues into it for the perfecting perfection of the coming of the Son of God now he's declared what is to take place Lord fill me up build me up that I may teach others now he's taking the next stage of what that I may teach others that I may teach the fivefold ministry that they may bring these things now there's worth it if the brother that I heard to say it when he said brother Branham was the fivefold ministry no I told you what I believe he could fulfill every office of the fivefold ministry yes siree he could take each office and deliver and use that office and work in it because he was a prophet sent from God what he said now these young men will take it home and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord the fie foam industry the hey church I'm serious it's can be we need to get something straight get it straight and then just let down here so well this is it this is the straight thing right placing it in total order that the Prophet was to come to teach others how to get working what I am then he sees and he brings forth the fivefold ministry is that not according to Ephesians is it not according to Ephesians go ahead brother pull up the seasons you got down is that not according to what it says yes he that descended is the same awful that I've seen it up above all heavens that he might fill all things he gave some apostles some prophets and he talking about gifts right coming down some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ okay now I'm gonna lay it a little deeper in a second so you better start frowning or smiling one of the two okay you're real feisty on that let's just lay it out now if you don't believe in the fivefold ministry what you're doing here what are you using the fivefold ministry is just a hope just in case this fails over here let me be over here that won't work what do you believe in the fivefold ministry but I told you over and over told you want to go I don't believe with all the fivefold ministry that's Nexus to me at the fivefold ministry I have no problems with that I'm not talking about those with false doctrines and thunders and virtues and souls and all kind of River Jordans and no holy ghost and all of that coming down I spent how many services back about three years ago that I covered each one of those doctrines and why I do not believe them took a whole service like I don't believe in the two Lords I don't believe in the two sold I don't believe in the seventh under virtual messages I don't I believe what brother Branham said well I've been honest enough well I thought man they're gonna get me on this one one man sent back a note and said you don't understand brother so-and-so that was the only comment that I had after I forgot how many services covering each doctrinal issue and showing why I don't believe it because I won't be the pastor I'm gonna make it plain right I believe in a fivefold ministry right but I don't believe in a onefold and I don't mean brother Branham will put that above okay brother Branham was outside the fivefold ministry in the base he could fulfil it was in the office but he comes outside the fivefold ministry to teach those that are in the fivefold ministry that's all I've ever said to you not putting him outside know where we're putting it to the right order he's the one that brought the message we're supposed to take his message and declare it to the people and teach it the same way he did and look for the same things he looked for right for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and curd about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ I believe in the FIFO ministry and then there's no part so saying well well brother so-and-so don't believe it without ain't gonna do it Sam yeah I'm not so and so that's it's been if you don't talk to God itself I think the one but I just ask you a simple question what are you doing listening if you don't believe in the five for ministry and the heaven help don't make it well just in case these other things that I've got don't work out let me have this right here this would be straight and honest and say this is where we're staying all right and see then that puts it into that place place to her that we can lay it down and just say this is it you say to me brother day what do you believe I believe the Word of God and I believe God has declared it and brought it unto us he wrote it delivered it brought it into our being gave us the wonderful opportunity of books and etc you know the printings and the thing to where we could read it he got it brought over in two different languages you know King James Version zet cetera to word that we could be able to read it and study it he has given us everything that was to be and he promised to send a prophet in the last day and he said it right he said the prophet of God among us to bring the message the Prophet had to go back and put his in the Bible he said there's we're not adding to they said to and said when your ability said you could write or what 23rd chapter of Revelation he said they were trying to trap him but then he turned it back to the honest to the point he said you can't add to the Word of God that if you do you add two plagues to your own self look what it's so dangerous to say well brother branham was a false prophet you know well what are you saying when you say and he's not right with God what you see Church to believe what the prophet has brought us is wonderful but that takes a FIFO ministry to carry it home there's any problem with that I mean that's the Word of God and that's the prophet yeah but I just don't sit what that's where the trouble is I have seen we want our own ways and that's where we hear what we want to Richard now talking about this yesterday coming up the road you know really you hear what you want to hear they don't matter what's there do you hear what you want to hear right now that may be sound crazy but it's true they don't matter what say it you get what you believe like I said about the brother that said he believed in the fivefold ministry most people do what Arthur brother he blame the fivefold ministry yeah he believes it his one out and he believes in it did you say he don't believe in it said now he believes in it within the next get another message it says brother Branham was the fivefold ministry well somebody needs get straight that's all I say it not trying to make anything to word it would do but try my best to explain to you what the Bible is talking about why don't we get down to what the word is saying it's like I said want to go you mean I would backslide go back out in the world first thing you know I'm a drunk now I'm gonna alcoholic I don't run into the pool going I'm doing Hong Kong well you know what that mean I mean that wasn't say to start with it's time to face those things huh what you got to remember something else is true now come on open your mind for a second you realize if you use the word backslide correct you got a wonderful thing you can't backside if you haven't been somewhere well brother Dale I'm Baxley it well good now you can do something about it now let's pray for you don't move I'll get back in so you think I'm lost I just say is lost I said she's battling you said yours back flip do you understand but see we like the old Pentecostal words what well I'm backsliding what I do and I had just crazy same things baptism long ago I back slid so I left sight left the baptismal hole Goshen and come down to sanctification you never did how the baptismal hold go cause if you ever did you can't lose it right you can't lose it if you ever had it and you came back slide if you ain't been some work to backslide from take it like that bullet it's all back clear well praise God knowing there's somebody right we can get with God to get straight well you're not gonna condemn us all sinners to hell why why when we're all brethren said we backside Daly is that what he said oh but that was he meant to say you backside he knowed how to talk he said we that's what always were so marvelous with me to read him and hear him say those things that he put herself right in this category with everybody he never boosted his self away up above even though ever ride in the world was to be there because of what God done every rider in the world was to boost him up but he never boosted itself up he always boosted the people up that's a true Christian he had that grace that her brother was talking about Wednesday night see if you know how Grace you can't give out grace right you can't give out grace if you don't have grace you don't know what grace is how can you give grace to anybody else but come on church I'm trying to get you to just to see the truth of what we're talking about God wrote in his word with the Apostle Peter Paul would come along riding his writings and they're all saying the same thing different wording different mannerisms different styles different things to say different things to deal with yes but the same faith now you remember life Sunday when I thought I went over and over over and over one faith one Lord one baptism not many face no not a faith it's be faith right see then let's put our whole life on the one thing and see for ourselves what it's all about God has given us the opportunity to have a great day in a time to live you realize that sometimes it would be better if we were totally persecuted now I can quote brother Branham so come on the run said the church does better under persecution now you know yourself you do better when things are going wrong somebody to get a that's our problem that's my problem right now ain't nobody want to argue with okay are you gonna argue it but I'm sure gonna contend for the faith right why can't we be what we are and just be Christians in this and the last side all of the things of doctrines of man's ideas and come forth with the Word of God come on musicians come on I'm just trying my best to get you to see something and if it hurts your feelings I'm sorry but I'm not sorry we're bringing out in the open any thoughts this is contrary to the Word of God I'm not because that's that's what I'm here for that's the things that we're - and that's what I've said to you now I made it plain two or three times one more Paul and Peter said the same thing the Prophet said in the same time the fivefold ministry is to say the same thing if you don't change the fivefold ministry is that plain enough is that and and brother Branham even made it's older than frantically one time he says it asked him honestly what was the question will the bride have a will rot have a ministry they know who knows what he said I know one back her shaking head two or three you know what said will the bride have a ministry sure she consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers they were asking him about a ministry and he's explaining the ministry come on that's the quote will the bride have a ministry he did say yes it's gonna be great things hear great things out darkness to be Doudna he said she the bride consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers that's the ministry that's why I've always said wouldn't it be something for coming to ask you to run for president and I'm a pastor of a church and asked me to run for president will that be the biggest disgrace well because I got the greatest opportunity missed an O [Music] Oh anybody have a need just come unless
