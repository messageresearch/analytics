TRANSCRIPT
========================================
expect good morning everyone everybody feeling good doing good why is that so loud oh that's fun everybody never been that loud everybody's Qui been on no that's not it it's coming through here we're looking at Matthew Chapter 5 but turn to um John St John not first John no John Matthew Mark Luke John that John Big John John Big John John John what John one not first John but John one we got that Monica you say both yeah one one is kind with one with the five kid four kid yeah I see them they just came in husband husband's blindead Brown they're from Florida the's from Ohio okay well the Florida ones are here I just thought they our church is expanding this morning yeah Monica family it would expand all right let's review before we get to John where we came from blessed are the poor in spirit for their is the Kingdom of Heaven in 2 Corinthians 8:9 for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich so Christ was an example for us to follow and he demonstrated all these attributes the characteristics of someone that is in this new kingdom that he's um telling about in Psalm 861 bow down in your ear oh Lord hear me for I am poor and needy characteristics of a bever of believer blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted everybody can see all right he has despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not a man of sorrow is and acquainted with grief Sor him because people turned him down and wouldn't believe his message and couldn't see him and then we uh taking on the same attributes we begin to mourn for sin in our lives and mourn because other people just like he mourned that people couldn't see see the word that he was trying to teach can't see the truth blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth the me will get all the promises of God everything that was promised when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force in John 65 to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone think about and and us the the spirit of God in us makes us not to want to promote ourselves and make us some something big but uh just like he did and I know the whole I know the whole story about how it wasn't time for him to to introduce his Earthly Kingdom but uh it's kind of uh the spirit of it is he he uh didn't he wasn't interested in making himself uh over you know right something something big in that way his Brethren therefore said unto him John in John 73 show thyself un the world cuz they thought U and it goes on in John 73 that he um went separated himself and went apart from the people his bre if and show show thyself under the world and that's what uh maybe a lot of times we kind of it's the opposite of meekness to show make yourself something big blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled fulfilled by fulfilling God's word Matthew 5:17 think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill to fulfill everything that the pro that the word spoke about and in John 4:34 Jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work and that's what we're our our role is to uh believe God's word take it in fulfill everything that God's word said about us if it said we're blessed uh then we could hang on to that promise that if we hunger and thirst after righteousness we see see God's word make uh made real in our lives and not just uh we're not just here to learn about God and and put it up on the shelf and say yeah I know I know all about it but it's to change our lives to fulfill his word in US blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy Titus 3:5 said not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost and mercy how do you know if you if Mercy has been shown to you then you will show Mercy in James 21:18 he said yeah a man may say thou H has faith and I have Works show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works this is a a characteristic of a Believer to be merciful to others to introduce to pull other people to Christ by your life and then blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and that's what we're going to talk about now what what does it mean to be pure in heart and if you're pure in heart you'll see God and think about when Jesus was standing on this mountain telling all of these Parables the the almighty God remember that first slide was that that Galaxy that the hble telescope took a picture of the same one that spoke that Gacy into existence was standing before them speaking these Beatitudes speaking these blessings but they couldn't see him because uh maybe their motives and objectives and the things that they desired in life were not pure and think about go down back through history and think about all the people that did see God and it's not the people that lived uh you kind of uh might be tempted to let make like merciful shall obtain Mercy because uh like uh that we're saved by our works or the pure in heart will see God because they live pure lives which is is true but it's uh remember Rahab uh saw God she was a uh a prostitute the woman at the well was a a woman of ill Fame uh this the Good Samaritan all uh go down through history and the people that saw God were Longing To See were had a desire to see God and um even though when they saw him maybe their lives weren't perfect but after they saw God then God began to purify their lives and uh um root a change in their life so the pure in heart is we looked at that quote last time where brother R said the the pure in heart is someone that will believe God that will take God at his word and won't settle for uh any leev to any uh false Doctrine to be to be introduced so let's look at John 1 46 and 49 see what kind of what kind of person it takes to uh to see God start at John 1 verse 46 and Nathaniel said unto him Nathaniel was talking to Phillip who had been praying a Desiring to see the things of God and brought up maybe to look for a messiah that one would come to um deliver men from their sins and he he was praying when Philip found him Andel or Nathaniel was praying when Philip found him and Nathaniel or first Versa sorry and Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto him come and see now all the others maybe look Upon Jesus and and could not see God made manifest mhm Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith him behold an Israelite indeed and whom is no G now his motives and objectives and what he was Desiring in life was pure and uh it reminds me of a story my dad used to tell me growing up about he uh he was in a Pentecostal church and one day he got in the car and there was a a minister in the car and he pulled out this big water of bills and said son if you want to be a preacher this is what you can have a big water bill so his motives and objectives were not in he wasn't he was not pure in heart Desiring to see Desiring to seek God now Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee now Nathaniel's Eyes Are Open he can see that this just isn't any man think about all the all the uh all the times that brother brandham turned his back on the audience in the congregation and some people in the audience could see God in that man but some couldn't and then we're going to kind of go down through uh the how brother random said you can see God in his universe and his word and his son and his people and all four of those uh some can see God you can look up in the stars and look outside and see God uh manifesting his telling the story of the Resurrection by the way the sun moves across the sky and goes down and comes up the next day or how every every fall the uh nature goes into the ground and then comes up the next year resurrection and you can look at those things and one person can see God and the other can't the same thing about uh what about when the when a minister standing behind the platform this this morning after this Sunday school lesson some will be able to say well this this this is the word of God because I know that it Bears record with it's the same thing that Paul said and others will say well it's just I'm just here I'm just a church some can see God in the people and some can't Nathaniel said unto him once knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called the when thou was under the washed under the Fig Tree I saw thee Nathaniel answered and said unto him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel and he got a revelation he can see God he look past the flesh think about Peter uh when Jesus said who who am I and he said thou are the Christ the son of God and he said Flesh and Blood My Flesh my outside hasn't revealed this to you but the Father in Heaven has revealed has opened this to you because Peter was pure in heart so let's um so you can see God in his universe and his word and his son and his people and when you can see these things by Christ Living in you brother Rand said and show us the father and suffices there was so much God on the inside he could see him on the outside he's talking about that Deacon in his church if you want to see God in his Universe get him on the outside and he goes on to talk about watch the birds sing in the trees he's in his Universe did you ever see him in a sunset you can see him all around because he's he fills you up right and changes the way you look at things right changes your eyesight now let's look at uh expand it on out look into look into the universe and the um the U remember how brother brand talked about Daniel uh uh was the head of the Magi in in Babylon and if you look back through history all of the the constellations and the star patterns and everything are the exactly the same across all of the civilizations they came back through down through history somebody way back Beyond had a revelation Josephus said it goes all the way back to Seth that he could look up into the stars and say that uh I and see God's word patterned in the stars the story of redemption told now it's got to take a revelation because look at this you got 1 2 3 4 five five stars how can you see a ram in that little simple constellation Aries you look up in the stars and see well there's there's the Redeemer Aries mhm that's the same way not just the universe the same way with uh the the word and the sun you can open up this this Bible and unless God opens it to you it's just like this constellation I I don't know what it means I remember when I first started my journey I would open up a church AG book and uh the Bible and I it it was almost like Greek but over time it begins God to unfold it right that's right and unfold it and uh in in James chapter 4 James said um uh he wrote uh if you draw unto God he'll draw unto you and cleanse your cleanse your hands you oh you Sinners and purify your heart uh he's talking about uh he said purify your heart you double minded because a pure heart is somebody that desires to see God and and won't take anything else not any leev of the world is Desiring to um to for just the pure unadulterated word of God to see him and his creation and his people and his word and his son and look at at the solar system and you can see God in his Perfection how remember number three is life on the third day of creation life was came into being and uh what planet are we 1 2 3 and it just speaks of of uh you look at how the moon was put into orbit just perfectly to reflect the light of the sun it testifies of the bright and this and and in God how when it's a full moon you can look up into the night sky and see the the Moon is so bright that you can see everything and the Earth was put into orbit in such a way that they had it was just big enough to hold just to to pull just amount the right amount of atmosphere together so that we could have air to breathe if it was too big it would spin into the sun if it was too small you wouldn't have enough oxygen and atmosphere but it was placed just perfect you know Mercury was just a a big old hot cold so close to the Sun that nothing could live on it but we're positioned right in just the right spot let's look at real quick at Psalm 19 which tells of the of the heavens now you can kind of see the pattern here verses 1 to 4 this this first part talks about the the heav theonomy and then this last part talks about the scriptures and it's compared them and you and you think when you read it he's changing topics when he Swit when he gets to verse seven when he starts talking about the scriptures he's talking about something else but he's talking about the same thing Jack have a question yeah I get up really early in the morning sometimes you see that Moon and all the stars seem like that fade away but you see one star which is north star mhm what that shining star so let's uh let's read through this real quickly uh the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork day unto Day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge every day when the sun comes up Resurrection every night you're going to have to die use your time wisely um you're going to have to die unless you go in the Rapture yes uh there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard all over the Earth the heavens testify of God's glory and of his of redemption their line is gone out through all the Earth their measurement uh you're going to have to answer one day for uh judgment is what this story is that there's a redeemer and and it's the same story that is told in this Bible that's why we don't have to look at the stars now because that same story was first told in the heavens now it's and then it was told in the pyramid it was magnified and now it's told in this Bible magnified even greater and greater their Ling has gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he said a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoice rejoices as a strong man to run a race his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit into the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof now verse seven swi to talk about the scriptures and how the same thing applies to God's word here that we're reading the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the statutes of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether more to be desired are they than gold yet and much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward we warned by the reading of the scripture just the same way the Ancients were warned by looking at the stars for 2,000 years or so so before Moses began to write the scripture the Stars testified of that a redeemer would have to come who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from Secret faults keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let him not let him not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength amen and my redeemer then Psalm 147 for he said he tell the number of the Stars he calleth them all by their names every Star God gave a name and some of the names of the stars are written in the Bible in job 91 he said which maketh Arcturus Arcturus is the constellation boots and boots was the man that had a sickle in one hand and and a Shepherd staff in the other to both reap and to and to her the sheep and Orion Orion is the uh the the ancient acadians called called and the the light of Heaven the um coming down from heaven bringing Revelation and playes in the chambers of the South ples is a constellation that has seven stars job 26:13 by his Spirit ples the Ancients called that the congregation of the Lord job 2613 by his Spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand ha formed the Crooked serpent serpent there's a big serpent that typifies that great battle that goes that went all all the way from Genesis to Revelation job 38: 31-32 can't thou bind the sweet influences of ples or loose the bands of Aran cast thou bring forth mazero in his season or C thou guide Arcturus with his sons a't that something Arcturus had sons and mazero is the zodiac sign that um I'm going talk about in if we have some time Amos 58 seek him that maketh the Seven Stars the Seven Stars as ples and Orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the Waters of the sea and porth them out upon the face of the Earth the Lord is his name and brother R said the he talking about the ancient and as I got back into some of the ancient history this is in his wonders to perform 1958 such as his two bab on and many of the other ancient writers to study what these Magi I find out the Magis in India were really the means of the Persians that we were speaking of the other night in bu shar's Big Rock and Roll Party when the me of Persians took over the Babylonian Kingdom and they had immigrated and got up into India now the Indian is called the Untouchable but the Hindu is the Mido Persian and and in there they still have these Arts of the wise man now I find that these Magis were not these type of fellas today that take the stars and tell fortunes cuz taking the stars and trying to look at yourself is the opposite of what you should be doing or what they they back then when that was their Bible when they were looking at that it should have been telling of Christ the Redeemer and the story of redemption but they were scientific men who watched the heavenly bodies and could look know every little star that was visible to the human eye and they were pure in heart any little move it meant some spiritual significance that meant something let's look at uh for they had learned in J watching a star 1959 for they had learned in job and of the moving of the stars and the names of the stars and they watched for that that one true God to give them a Sign by the stars and they stud those Stars just like we study the Bible it was handed down Scrolls from ancient fathers that they studied those heavenly bodies and they knowed where everyone was and if one moved the least bit out of its place they knew it and I'm sure it bothered him a little bit cuz you want to have everything just like in uh when you hear someone teaching something that's a little bit off the word bother you you want to uh be real careful one day uh one day they were looking at the stars and they saw brother talked about how they they were looking up of the night sky and thinking about all the things that Daniel wrote about and uh they saw a strange star and then and they followed it when they got to their destination they tried to tell everybody about it but they were the only ones that could see what the message of that star where it was taking them and Josephus tells a story of how they look down in this well the same well that David dug and when they got to Bethlehem and they looked down in the well at the bottom of it they could see the reflection of that star and they knew that's how they knew that they were in the right place um so the star LED them to God now the zodiac is a um brother R talked about the Zodiac beginning with Virgo and ending with Leo the Lion and that's not the way that astrologers read it astrologers start at Aries and then at Pisces but it goes around in a circle and when you look up at the night sky the sun and the and the constellations are moving they're both moving but the sun moves faster and every month the sun moves in a line right through all the constellations and it touches on each one one after the other now over time after about 2,000 years the Ancients knew that the uh constellations will begin to change a little bit the the the order of it there's a little bit of shift so that now we're um we're seeing the start of the year begins a couple of constellations over than what it did when uh you know two two or 3,00 years ago so they had to leave us a a way for us to know where it started is it's a never ending circle where do you start do you start at Aries like the astrologers say or do you start at Virgo and brother Brown knew that you started Virgo there's a temple in E Egyptian temple that uh was uh built in uh hundreds hundreds of years before Christ was born and in the in the top of this Temple there's a a little a little graphic of uh Virgo and Leo the Lion and it shows which direction to go because of the Sphinx the Sphinx has a woman's head and a lion's tail and it's pointing that way and so they say that's how you that's how that's the the riddle of the Sphinx is which way to how to read the uh the constellation and in Shalom the first Bible Shalom 1964 brother R said in the Zodiac we find out in the constellations of the stars that he declared the whole Bible in the constellation of the zodiac we find out there that he starts off the very first figure in the zodiac is the Virgin and the last figure in the zodiac is Leo the Lion showing that Jesus will come first to the Earth by a verion he'll come the second time as the lion of the tribe of Judah and he goes through the cross fish the cancer Aid what we're living in now and all the heav is declared and then uh he said and God's only provided place of worship did you notice that it starts off of the Virgin the first figure in the Zodiac the last figure is Leo the Lion he come first by the Virgin he comes next as the lion of the tribe of Judah just before that a cancer ra a cross fish all the rest of the ages if we had time to go through it which we have at the Tabernacle I don't I guess that's not record it CU must not be can't find it yeah so um in the 1800s this lady name by name of Francis Roland went back she spent her whole life going back to the ancient uh to to try to find what the meaning of the uh star signs she went back to find what the Ancients called the stars that were part of the constellation so uh just a real high level overview I wanted to quickly go through uh this the name of the stars in the constellation so uh in Virgo you got Stars called alimac which was Arabic for the branch SE there's another star called SE which means the Messiah uh there's another star called zavi jaave the gloriously beautiful and alamedan who shall come down there it's also there's also a calan word vend mediatrix the branch who cometh and so there's 12 there's 12 12 constellations in main constellations in the uh zodiac and in each constellation around them are uh two three or four small constellations that kind of are interwoven and they're all relate so serpents wraps around Ursa Miner to tell a story what why is the serpent wrapping around Ursa Minor and so they all interact when Orion comes up the Scorpion goes down you'll never see Orion and the Scorpion in the sky at the same time because when Aion comes the bringer of Life the Scorpion goes below the Horizon you can't see them together when scorpion goes up Orion goes down and vice versa so the constellations that are part of Virgo's coma the woman and child desired of all Nations sent Taurus despise sin offering and Boots that's the one archus that job talked about he cometh with his Shepherd's Crook and his sickle Libra is the scales in Hebrew maanam weighing in Arabic Al zua Redemption and UK and aad and tuu or the holy Altar and it it has these Stars Zu alui the purchase zuban chamali the price which covers zubab close is close to Centaurus the price of the conflict and in that Constellation Are the are the are the uh they called deacons the crooks the cross lupus the lamb s the lamb it's called the lamb in the ancient dendera zodiac and uh Corona the crown or Jewel and uh Scorpio and the the odd thing about it is and astrologist say that a Scorpio is represented by two animals it's the only one that's represented by two and the other the one the other animal that Scorpio is is the eagle so if you look at the the four corners of the zodiac you got Aquarius the man Taurus the Bull uh Scorpio the eagle and Leo the lion that represent the four corners of the zodiac blind man Ox Eagle MH and the stars that make up the Scorpion are Anar is the wounding and it's this deep red star in the center of the Scorpion and lth the perverse the star and the stinger and constellations that make up Scorpio are serpents and of ofus the struggle with the Enemy and Hercules the mighty one uh and there's a star in Hercules called Ral gey the head of him who bruises and you can kind of see how this all fits together wrestling with the serpent stepping on the head of the Scorpion see how they all fit together you got the scales over here just a beautiful story Sagittarius the redeemer's Triumph the beauty of the coming forth you got stars named name the gracious one nkey Prince of the earth now whoer they going or sending forth we just got a few seconds you can see the the con the 12 constellations are divided up into groups of four four four four and the first four end with the defeat of Draco the dragon the second four end up with the uh cedus the sea monster leviathon B the third book ends with Hydra the old serpent destroyed so they're all four they're all three reading repeating that same story capricornus is the place of the sacrifice there's a star called dby the sacrifice slain ma mad Arab like the slave and it has constellations called Saga the arrow sent forth Aila the e wounded the dolphin Rising so the eagle goes down wounded and then Rises up in Resurrection delphinus and there there's so much in these constellations why why the uh the the last one was a part goat and part fish Redeeming the people that that were in him Dinda the sign of Aquarius is the a man with a with a bucket pouring out water s elet the record of the pouring for side out soon to pour out in numbers 24:7 it says he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many Waters and his King shall be higher than a God and his kingdom shall be exalted in Isaiah 44:3 for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine Offspring and the constellation and Aquarius areis australas a stream Pegasus he goeth and returneth who he ascended to his father and then so he could return in us and pour out his blessings and sness the blesser returneth and then uh real quick pises this is where the astrologers end the constellation but this is uh this isn't the end for the if you look at it the right way from Virgo to Leo the Egyptians call it P Orion the fishes of him that cometh and Hebrew D the fishes and O there's a star called OCTA that United and another star called alaka the H and the constellations that are part of B Pisces are the band binding cus the sea monster the band binds the fish together to the monster and androma the chain woman sfus the Redeemer coming to rule Hosea 11:4 said I drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and I was to them them as they take off they that take off the Yol on their jaws and I laid meat unto them and Isaiah 52 2:3 Shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down Jerusalem loose thyself from the band of th neck o captive Daughter of Zion for thus sayith the Lord you have sold yourselves for not and ye shall be redeemed without money stop right all right amen
