[17:36] amen make that where you can see
[17:39] it in a
[17:46] minute I do
[17:50] that now here we
[17:55] go sorry about that
[18:02] that better all right well we could
[18:05] quote this anyway you didn't even need
[18:06] to see it in the beginning was the word
[18:08] the word was with God and the Word was
[18:09] God and the Word was made flesh and
[18:11] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[18:13] the glory of the only begotten of the
[18:14] father full of grace and truth John 3:3
[18:18] and Jesus answered and said verily
[18:19] verily I say unto thee except the man be
[18:21] born
[18:22] again he cannot enter enter or see or
[18:26] understand the kingdom of God John 16:12
[18:29] says I have yet many things to say unto
[18:32] you but you cannot bear them now this is
[18:34] Jesus speaking how be it when he the
[18:37] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[18:38] you into all Truth for he shall not
[18:40] speak of himself but whosoever he shall
[18:43] who whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[18:45] he speak like I said before he's
[18:47] speaking through the bride and he will
[18:49] show you things to come you may be
[18:50] seated the Lord has his Blessing to the
[18:52] reading of the word now we're looking
[18:54] toward we're going to stop today and and
[18:57] talk about a couple of things that that
[18:59] we have not really discussed kind of
[19:01] break it down for the morning and then
[19:03] uh uh do a little preaching this
[19:05] afternoon but we we're trying to get to
[19:07] a place of maturity amen every one of us
[19:10] trying to get to a place of maturity
[19:11] we're not you shouldn't be satisfied
[19:13] with where you are you shouldn't be
[19:15] satisfied with what you are all right
[19:18] we're going to be what God told us we're
[19:19] going to we're going to agree with him
[19:21] that we are perfect but on this side
[19:24] looking at us it's kind of sometimes
[19:25] hard to look in the mirror and say
[19:27] you're a perfect
[19:31] guy come look in my mirror then y'all
[19:33] come look in my mirror and you look and
[19:35] see the same you'll see a person that's
[19:36] not perfect but I'm just going by what
[19:38] God Said but he gave us a way to get
[19:41] there and he said we are going to be
[19:44] changed in the moment in the twinkl of
[19:46] an ey there's somebody that's not going
[19:49] to die somebody is going to tell death
[19:52] you do not have a Hold on Me Anymore all
[19:56] right but it's not going to be a baby
[20:00] driving the
[20:01] car it's going to be a mature bride that
[20:04] knows what to do brother Brown said with
[20:06] the word of God somebody that's studied
[20:08] somebody that's prayed somebody that's
[20:10] read your Bible that that's listened to
[20:12] the prophet's message that that listens
[20:14] to to sermons and and really get
[20:16] something out of it all right cuz the
[20:19] Bible tells us the marriage of the Lamb
[20:21] has come and his wife has made herself
[20:22] ready now remember the wife made herself
[20:25] ready here yes we're not waiting to get
[20:29] to Perfection that's right Perfection
[20:31] has met us here yes sir all right our
[20:34] white robes are here yes not coming
[20:37] we're not going to receive white robes
[20:39] the day you received the baptism of the
[20:40] Holy Ghost your soul was robed in the
[20:43] robe of righteousness your soul was
[20:46] robed in
[20:49] Perfection you say I can't see it well
[20:51] there's there's a dual thing we got to
[20:53] look at and that's why that we get the
[20:54] statue of perfect man and we'll talk
[20:56] about in just a minute there's there's a
[20:58] spirit realm of you that's
[21:00] human your soul is obviously the real
[21:03] you but there's a spirit part of you
[21:05] that's human that is a nature that you
[21:08] know we fight it yes everybody fights
[21:12] who do you fight the most you fight
[21:14] yourself all right but there is a there
[21:18] is a place for us to be there's a place
[21:21] that the prophet of God I believe in the
[21:23] end time that that irenius and and
[21:25] Martin and Luther and different ones
[21:27] they couldn't stand behind the pull pit
[21:29] and say Hey you are The Perfect sinless
[21:32] Bride of Jesus Christ now they may have
[21:34] weaved it in their sermon but they ended
[21:36] it by baptizing people in the name of
[21:38] father son Holy Ghost they ended it by
[21:40] saying let's speak to the Trinity all
[21:42] right so they didn't have everything
[21:44] they were robed but they were robed in
[21:46] their
[21:47] soul all right they they were whest they
[21:50] were white white righteous in their soul
[21:53] but their Humanity their their their
[21:56] Spirit realm is what thought was
[21:58] controlling or suppressing because of
[22:01] what they
[22:02] heard all right we'll read it in just a
[22:05] minute that's why that the prophet had
[22:07] to come that's why I keep reading it
[22:08] that that there's a the weakness was
[22:11] where
[22:13] pulet weakness was in the pull pet but
[22:15] now being that the weakness is in the
[22:18] pull pet I declare to you today the
[22:20] strength is in the pull pet if it's a
[22:23] truth the strength is in the pull pit
[22:25] and it's out to you making us all
[22:27] stronger
[22:30] taking us
[22:31] somewhere not just you know well it's
[22:33] Sunday well it's Wednesday well it's Bob
[22:37] Bob brother Bob well we love brother Bob
[22:40] oh my goodness he's been in Hebrews for
[22:42] all this time I wish they'd stay in
[22:45] Hebrew okay I'm 13 something in on the
[22:49] son of man I ain't even got to the son
[22:50] of man yet so we're getting
[22:53] there thank God he gave us thank God he
[22:56] gave us all this time to get ready ready
[22:58] but there's one day when he's going to
[22:59] say Hey listen hey I've had
[23:03] enough come on up a little higher
[23:06] there's that
[23:08] call and where's the call coming from
[23:10] it's coming from inside you if you have
[23:12] the new birth there has to be a call
[23:13] inside of you all right and we'll talk
[23:16] about that in just for just a minute so
[23:18] the marriage when you become born again
[23:21] you become married you are Ms Jesus
[23:24] Christ right he robes you with
[23:27] righteousness he robes your soul it's
[23:29] just as perfect as God is it has changed
[23:32] into an 18year old kid yes
[23:36] sir I just believe that that's the power
[23:40] that's already laying inside of you if
[23:41] you're born again today already laying
[23:44] inside of you all right but then we got
[23:46] to get that out to the spirit realm
[23:48] because Satan can play in that Spirit
[23:50] realm and and seemingly push push God
[23:54] back into your soul I said seemingly cuz
[23:58] sometimes we feel defeated sometimes we
[24:00] feel like we're not worth anything
[24:02] that's right sometimes we feel like
[24:04] we're not perfect sometimes we feel like
[24:06] well it just ain't worth it it's worth
[24:09] it yes
[24:11] sir we'll talk about that in just a
[24:13] minute CU I want to break something down
[24:15] for you that we haven't done before on
[24:17] you must be born again brother Brown
[24:19] you're still what you are until you're
[24:21] actually born again of the spirit of God
[24:24] you know brother R tells us he said the
[24:26] soul is the nature of the spirit and
[24:29] that really just turns people upside
[24:31] down and and that's where you get your
[24:34] two Soul Doctrine and you you know your
[24:35] spirit overtakes this and any
[24:38] garbage but the soul is the nature of
[24:40] the spirit what if if you today if you
[24:43] love the
[24:46] Lord you come to church you set aside
[24:49] time you're here to to take your memory
[24:53] that you that you have that you have
[24:55] learned from Brother Dale and brother
[24:57] Bob and the different ones brother Aaron
[25:00] Brother Louis and listen to those
[25:02] different ones and brother collie long
[25:04] time ago when he used to do Sunday
[25:05] school class and different ones he used
[25:07] to preach you know you you what you're
[25:09] using your memory yes sir you're you're
[25:12] pulling that out like a computer you've
[25:14] got it stored and you're pulling it out
[25:17] either that or you're sitting here
[25:19] numb are you just sitting here not
[25:21] thinking about nothing how to fix your
[25:23] tractor how to cut your
[25:26] grass one brother told Brother Dell one
[25:29] time said brother Dale said I I didn't I
[25:31] want to be honest he said I didn't hear
[25:33] a thing you said he said but I I figured
[25:36] out how to fix my tractor while I was
[25:37] sitting in church well at least he was
[25:40] honest well praise the
[25:44] Lord I know our mind wanders don't tell
[25:46] me your mind doesn't wander
[25:48] off am I preaching to the right oh
[25:51] brother Anderson's
[25:56] like
[25:58] so the soul is the nature of the spirit
[26:00] your your your spirit your soul feeds
[26:03] off and come it has to come through
[26:05] memory reason it's got to come through
[26:06] that filter all right but now I want to
[26:09] tell you something though when we get to
[26:11] a spot I want you to see something that
[26:13] even brother Dale years
[26:15] ago you know brother Brown said you have
[26:18] one sense in the soul Faith or doubt
[26:20] right five in the memory reason
[26:23] conscious effects and Imagination five
[26:25] in the in the natural realm see feel
[26:28] smon here but inside you you have either
[26:31] God or the devil that's it all
[26:33] right but he had never dawned on him
[26:36] till he was and we'll read it here in
[26:37] just a minute when brother R went across
[26:39] a curtain of time he was in his
[26:41] theophany he was in his soul that was
[26:43] eternal and he would he had met people
[26:45] that their soul was
[26:47] eternal and they spoke to him they had
[26:50] memory of
[26:51] him they were conscious that he we'll
[26:54] read it here in just a few minutes when
[26:55] he went across a curtain of time so so
[26:58] when brother how went across a curtain
[27:00] of time it wasn't just his soul and it's
[27:01] like hanging up in the closet no no no
[27:05] he has fresh memory re and conscious
[27:07] effects and Imagination and I don't
[27:09] think his memory is completely blank to
[27:11] what he was on
[27:13] Earth wasn't to brother brandom it
[27:15] wasn't to those people they said hey
[27:17] you're you were a
[27:19] leader they had their memory reason but
[27:21] it was way bigger way more expanded than
[27:25] what ours is cuz we have that thing like
[27:27] the Bible said you know well that
[27:28] brother did this to me and that listen
[27:31] when we when across the curtain of time
[27:32] them brothers wasn't beating each other
[27:34] to death try to get the brother Rand
[27:35] them come on
[27:37] somebody them sisters wasn't going I got
[27:40] to him
[27:42] first no they said my precious brother
[27:45] and they came in order and ran and
[27:47] hugged his
[27:48] neck so the new birth is an experience
[27:51] so you've got to experience it here but
[27:53] where does it take place the new birth
[27:56] takes place in your
[27:58] soul and then it works its way out
[28:02] through the memory reason but then Satan
[28:05] because of the Fall he has access to
[28:07] work this way into that memory reason
[28:10] conscious affection imagination and mess
[28:13] you up or try to mess you up listen he
[28:16] can't make your soul listen to me he
[28:20] can't make your soul
[28:23] sin you're a free moral agent but if
[28:26] you're a Christian today Soul can't
[28:28] sin you say brother R says I sin every
[28:31] day you sin in your spirit realm every
[28:33] day listen I sin because I don't let my
[28:36] soul take
[28:38] over that's my sin my sin is unbelief
[28:42] that's why brother Bram said that's all
[28:43] sin was was
[28:46] unbelief listen to the inside the new
[28:49] birth is an experience something takes
[28:52] place so it's not in other words it's
[28:54] not the what we always thought was a new
[28:56] birth was that now I get this new
[28:58] feeling now I get this new emotion now I
[29:01] get this now that's not
[29:03] it it's what it's Jesus Christ
[29:06] personally coming to you his
[29:09] person coming to your
[29:13] person cleaning out your person not
[29:17] destroying you you're still a human not
[29:20] destroying you but he comes and dwells
[29:24] inside of you he loves something about
[29:28] you cuz he said this is my beloved Son
[29:31] in whom
[29:32] I'm pleased to dwell God Don't
[29:36] Lie God does not lie he can't
[29:39] lie if he come on the day of Pentecost
[29:41] and told them hey I'm pleased to dwell
[29:43] in those 120 people came to Jesus on the
[29:46] River Jordan by type and said I'm
[29:49] pleased to dwell in that human be vessel
[29:52] what about me and you the day you got
[29:54] born again God said hey I love that guy
[29:56] I love that sister
[29:59] but I don't like their
[30:01] ways so I'm going to send Apostles
[30:03] prophets pastors teachers and
[30:04] evangelists see see you can go the other
[30:07] way and you can say well if my soul is
[30:09] already perfect if I'm already redeemed
[30:13] why do I need
[30:15] you why do I need to
[30:18] study cuz that Soul inside of you wants
[30:23] out he's wanting to work in your memory
[30:27] reason conscious affection imagination
[30:29] so the preaching of the word is for what
[30:31] driving out unclean
[30:35] spirits the only way you can cast out a
[30:37] devil really is by the word of God all
[30:39] right cuz Satan can't cast out Satan and
[30:42] you can't say well well I'm going to
[30:44] just you know do like the Catholic
[30:46] Church they going to put the water on
[30:47] you and throw stuff at you and all that
[30:48] stuff you can't do that you preach the
[30:51] word of God and make that devil so
[30:54] mad till you don't want to live there
[30:56] anymore
[30:58] but you shall receive power after that
[31:01] the Holy Ghost has come upon you so
[31:02] we've become powerless without the new
[31:05] birth and then we were talking about a
[31:07] permitted power power was given what
[31:09] given to Satan to do what it was given
[31:11] to Satan to do one
[31:13] thing one thing and that's keep you from
[31:17] getting born
[31:18] again you say no it's it's it's it's
[31:21] prnography is this is it no it's to keep
[31:23] you from being born again if he keep you
[31:25] from being born again he's got a all the
[31:27] other stuff that's
[31:29] right that's why brother Ram said the
[31:31] new birth right he said sin is unbelief
[31:37] yes listen your person today your person
[31:40] your soul is believing or not
[31:46] believing if you're a
[31:49] non-believer you're just sitting here I
[31:52] did that for
[31:54] years as a young kid
[32:00] hallu but Power was given well so do
[32:04] y'all well after your birth you're just
[32:06] dead I mean you're dead all the way
[32:08] around right that's why it's so
[32:10] important that's why I'll read this
[32:11] quote where brother R talks about your
[32:13] Soul's worth 10,000 worlds I'll read
[32:15] here in just a minute so we're going to
[32:16] get into the soul and separate it just a
[32:18] little bit more than we did the other
[32:20] day but now remember where in
[32:22] Revelations you look at we're going to
[32:24] get into the seals here pretty quick
[32:27] where do these white horse riders come
[32:30] from and where did they
[32:34] go where' they come
[32:37] from they come from
[32:43] you white
[32:46] righteous a horse is a power and when
[32:49] brother Rams broke that seal open when
[32:51] God broke that seal to brother brandham
[32:53] Satan had to what ride away
[32:57] he had to ride off he had to get away
[33:00] from that word that brother Randon was
[33:02] preaching he had to get away from it
[33:04] that's why you and I that's why I said
[33:06] let out what you are either you got
[33:07] those and you realize you got
[33:10] them or you realize you've got the lion
[33:13] ox man and Eagle inside and let that do
[33:15] the
[33:17] work so we want the horses I don't care
[33:20] what color they are we want them to ride
[33:21] away from us yes sir all right because
[33:24] we are a white righteous bride that's
[33:26] going to ride on a white
[33:29] horse but now remember not to
[33:34] battle no no no we come back Revelations
[33:37] 19
[33:38] Victorious riding on White Horse with a
[33:41] man leading us and said word of God down
[33:43] his thigh guess what all of us have the
[33:44] word of God down our thigh as we come
[33:47] out but that per that power was
[33:49] permitted to do one thing and that was
[33:52] that was almost to see the very elect
[33:55] but it was to make it was to show that
[33:58] God knew what he was doing come
[34:01] on by in just instead of just saying
[34:03] okay your soul is yeah yeah you're it
[34:06] you day of Pentecost all right Peter you
[34:08] ain't got to do nothing else now you're
[34:09] done you're you're sealed not what it do
[34:13] to
[34:13] Peter it really unsealed who Peter was
[34:17] they came out of a sealed door opened up
[34:20] the sealed
[34:22] Windows huh all that they were sealed up
[34:25] they were scared about
[34:27] once they receive this dunamis or this
[34:29] power then what did that first thing
[34:31] they did they run outside and said
[34:34] hey this is
[34:40] that brother M tells us
[34:43] that Christ in the true church is a
[34:46] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[34:48] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[34:50] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[34:51] church now look come to the church not
[34:53] the not not come into the barrooms and
[34:55] not come into the church
[34:58] this is all the devil's worried about
[34:59] he's not worried about them guys out
[35:01] there he's worried about you and he's
[35:04] really
[35:05] worried cuz remember we have his answer
[35:08] we know how to handle him now we're
[35:10] supposed to be able
[35:11] to and defile it making it lukewarm
[35:14] formal and Powerless by doing what
[35:18] saying well come shake my hand and
[35:20] you're born again come and save three
[35:23] hell marries and you're born again come
[35:25] and let me sprinkle you and you're born
[35:27] again oh it doesn't matter you can why
[35:29] you're not perfect and I'm not perfect
[35:31] you can't live that life they're exactly
[35:35] right but if you got somebody inside of
[35:38] you he can live that life if we'll just
[35:40] let him
[35:43] out Church age book says Satan crept
[35:45] into the church and blinded the people
[35:48] to this truth he's talking about water
[35:49] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[35:51] and and the trinitarian doctrine that's
[35:53] all false when they were blinded to it
[35:56] Who blinded
[35:57] them the preachers the priest they
[36:02] blinded the people the
[36:04] pope it wasn't long to the Church of
[36:07] Rome stop baptizing in the name of the
[36:08] Lord Jesus Revelations
[36:11] 2:6 but this thou Hast that thou hatest
[36:14] the Deeds of the nicians that word
[36:17] hatest means detest God detests false
[36:21] Doctrine which I also detest he said in
[36:25] other words it was a group of people
[36:27] that stood one day and said hey I don't
[36:29] believe that sthus guy I don't believe
[36:32] that false teaching over here from
[36:33] brother so and so and brother so and so
[36:35] everybody with
[36:37] me Revelations 2:14 but it keeps going
[36:40] to another church age I have a few
[36:42] things against it because they they hold
[36:44] you hold the doctrine there are them
[36:47] that hold the doctrine of balam who
[36:49] taught balb to cast a stum block before
[36:51] the children of Israel same thing in the
[36:52] message today to eat things sacrificed
[36:54] into idols and commit fornication so
[36:57] hast thou also them that hold the
[36:59] doctrine so now it's come to a doctrine
[37:01] of the nicians look which things I
[37:04] hate he said repent or else I will come
[37:08] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[37:10] them with the sword of my mouth which is
[37:13] the
[37:14] word Resurrection 1953 brother ad says
[37:17] see I don't want to blame you people
[37:19] it's the pull pits where it started no
[37:21] wonder that's the damnation of the
[37:23] country when Satan got in the pull pit
[37:25] that's the truth failing to preach what
[37:27] the UN unadulterated word of God or a
[37:30] furtherment of the Gospel I'm saying
[37:33] statue of perfect man growth development
[37:35] not just that you got it and just you're
[37:38] here no failing to preach the
[37:41] unadulterated word of God and the word
[37:44] of God will what produce just exactly
[37:48] what it said it would do I say to you
[37:50] today hang
[37:52] on this thing will produce itself it'll
[37:54] have to produce itself am amen amen but
[37:58] we explain it all way it's all way
[38:01] that's for some other day no it's for
[38:04] here 1964 talking about Satan got a hold
[38:07] of the Masterpiece in the Garden of Eden
[38:10] but praise God the great sculptor he
[38:13] started back what he started back with
[38:15] that foundation and then he's building a
[38:18] stature of a perfect he's building a
[38:20] bride like I'm going to tell you in a
[38:21] few minutes that is that can withstand
[38:24] all this yes there's some that couldn't
[38:27] they couldn't withstand that do listen
[38:29] that doctrine of father son Holy Ghost
[38:31] come from the pits of Hell brother BM
[38:33] said but they received that and they
[38:35] took it into their person not their soul
[38:38] but they took it into their being and
[38:40] preached it Satan was doing all
[38:44] that God never preached a trinitarian
[38:46] Doctrine see that's something it's hard
[38:48] for us to understand that how Luther can
[38:51] be born
[38:52] again that's why a lot of people thought
[38:54] he wasn't Luther can be born again in
[38:56] sealed perfect in his soul got a white
[39:01] robe but then he could preach a
[39:02] trinitarian Doctrine which didn't come
[39:04] from there it come from his person it
[39:07] come from his personality it came from
[39:09] what Satan could play with his memory
[39:10] reason conscience reasoning you still
[39:13] got reasoning though you're born again
[39:15] still got reasoning still got memory
[39:17] reason conscious all these different
[39:19] things we'll talk about that in just a
[39:24] minute then we come to a place where
[39:26] brother had to divide this out and
[39:28] remember look this is on the first seal
[39:31] so on the very first seal he is setting
[39:34] a a precedence I am talking to the bride
[39:40] only because those white horse riders
[39:42] folks that was in the
[39:45] church of his
[39:48] day he was dealing with it he could see
[39:51] it those Pentecostals that could live
[39:54] like the devil out out there and come in
[39:56] church and speaking tongues and
[39:58] interpretation and sound like Angels he
[40:00] said he knew where that horse
[40:08] was come truth he had problem with that
[40:14] horse well get
[40:17] quiet but he did where did it ride away
[40:19] from
[40:20] him cuz he preached several times a
[40:23] mighty conqueror back in the late 50s he
[40:25] preached out of Revelation
[40:27] six that that white horse rider was
[40:29] somebody sitting on it was the Holy
[40:30] Ghost down through the church he told
[40:32] you that well that was
[40:34] false all right but he had to come to a
[40:37] truth and he did praise God for the
[40:38] opening of these seals he said for all
[40:40] the different doctrines that he had
[40:41] already preached he he preached serpent
[40:44] seed he preached all these different
[40:45] doctrines why am I against organized
[40:47] religion why am I against this then he
[40:49] comes up in 1963 at the seals he said
[40:52] now I know
[40:53] why I hated that system so much
[40:57] now I know
[40:59] why that that white horse rider was not
[41:02] Christ he was the
[41:05] Antichrist so we come to a spot where
[41:07] brother man says
[41:09] hey I'm talking to the bride
[41:14] only remember he said this is that third
[41:17] pull who is it to the bride church and
[41:19] totally lost well in other words he was
[41:21] separating each one so that we would
[41:24] understand and listen because if you you
[41:26] get caught in the
[41:29] church you could be a foolish virgin but
[41:32] you can't be
[41:33] bride that's why I call you bride that
[41:36] you'll understand do you understand
[41:38] today that you're bride yes oh I think
[41:41] I'll just make it as a foolish virgin no
[41:42] you
[41:44] won't fish virgin somebody hadn't been
[41:47] taught we can't plead that
[41:53] sorry and then never since Jesus Christ
[41:55] on Earth I was thinking about this even
[41:57] yesterday a formidable opponent I was if
[42:01] you look on YouTube it's kind of well
[42:03] that's not really funny but you remember
[42:05] who Mike Tyson is you know he's he was
[42:07] this bad guy and I mean he'd knock you
[42:08] out in about 10 seconds well they was
[42:10] this one guy I mean he was cocky and he
[42:12] was pointing fingers and he you know
[42:14] you're out of here I'm I've got you and
[42:16] he was this much taller than him than
[42:20] Tyson they went out there and the bell
[42:22] went Ding and 8 seconds later that guy
[42:25] was knocked completely out
[42:27] he hit him one time that's the way the
[42:29] devil ought to be he thinks we're so
[42:31] little and so
[42:32] insignificant you just wait he now has a
[42:36] formidable opponent if he tells you this
[42:38] you say no that's not right if he tells
[42:40] you this no that's not right he tells
[42:42] you this no that's not right confuse
[42:45] him he's confused us long enough let's
[42:47] confuse
[42:50] him tired of that being confused we're
[42:52] all confused unless we have good
[42:56] teaching and a
[42:58] mature
[43:00] Ministry Amen brother R said look
[43:04] there's been bride there's been churches
[43:05] churches Brides Bri now see there's been
[43:07] Brides down through the church age but
[43:09] remember when when a
[43:12] bride marriage and
[43:15] divorce when a when a the bride commits
[43:18] adultery against a groom he can put her
[43:21] away and marry another
[43:23] right according to the Bible and in type
[43:27] that's what happened the the
[43:28] Pentecostals the Baptist the Methodist
[43:30] they were bride and there's some bride
[43:32] in there but but they the word didn't go
[43:34] on
[43:35] further they took on that denominational
[43:39] idea and God had to put them away I'm
[43:42] divorcing you remember he divorced
[43:43] Israel in the Old
[43:46] Testament he can do
[43:48] that but he's got a bride in every
[43:50] Church
[43:52] age and he sure got a bride in this age
[43:55] cuz he said right here but there's got
[43:57] to come one you see how he's honing this
[44:01] thing down as that pyramid hones down
[44:03] everything's being honed
[44:05] down to just a small group of people
[44:09] that's going to really receive this and
[44:10] carry it on to the coming of the Lord
[44:13] but there's got to come one Hallelujah
[44:15] there has to come a real bride now not
[44:17] the other Brides were false they were
[44:20] false bride but they weren't that false
[44:22] being not born
[44:25] again there must come one that's got not
[44:27] only got the mechanics but the
[44:30] Dynamics now what's the mechanics the
[44:32] mechanics is the word of God and then
[44:34] the Dynamics is the spirit on the word
[44:36] of God everybody with me all right
[44:39] quickening what you heard according to
[44:42] the
[44:43] mechanics that Dynamic Sparks what's
[44:46] inside that engine everybody with me all
[44:49] right we've got an engine we've had
[44:51] maybe the mechanics all these years
[44:53] we've had the the the workings of the
[44:55] word of God you know the cylinders and
[44:57] the valves and the cam shaft and all the
[45:00] different things we got that but without
[45:02] a
[45:03] spark without
[45:05] fuel it just sit there and it
[45:09] right but with the Dynamics in it carry
[45:14] us down the
[45:15] road see is what until we come to that
[45:20] place until we find that place what good
[45:22] is it to just polish the hubs
[45:29] we're talking about love the token the
[45:31] other Sunday full obedience now
[45:34] look the brides down through the church
[45:37] Ages were not fully
[45:40] obedient the first church ages maybe but
[45:43] then it got eroded like I said before
[45:45] like like like God told us said I have
[45:47] something against you you've accepted
[45:50] these false
[45:51] doctrines these Deeds now the doctrines
[45:54] you've accepted them and I've had to put
[45:56] you away that didn't mean that there was
[45:59] not born again Believers don't ever
[46:00] think that there are going to be way
[46:02] more in the church ages behind us than
[46:05] they are
[46:09] us because remember this is what honing
[46:13] time but full obedience look to the full
[46:16] word of God they didn't have the full
[46:18] word of God they thought they did Luther
[46:20] thought he did Wesley thought they did
[46:23] but they did
[46:24] not but now we have the full word of God
[46:28] so that entitles us to the Token what
[46:32] does it do that token keeps us from
[46:36] death they died in the Old Testament
[46:39] they died in the old church ages they
[46:41] died in part of this church
[46:44] age but the full word entitles us to
[46:48] that token that went over the door that
[46:51] not only saved our soul but it's going
[46:53] to change our body yes sir amen right
[46:56] that's the full word of God entitles us
[46:59] to this
[47:01] token and what happened when that token
[47:03] was applied right no Death Angel and
[47:07] they got to
[47:08] leave the next morning remember after
[47:11] the doorpost they went out the next day
[47:14] next
[47:14] morning look not what somebody has put
[47:17] into
[47:18] it and added to it but what God said
[47:22] about it Ephesians 4:29 says grieve not
[47:25] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[47:27] sealed until the day of redemption now
[47:30] hold that thought because we're going to
[47:31] talk about that in just a few minutes
[47:35] cuz brother Ram told us said what he's a
[47:36] very timid holy spirit is very timid you
[47:38] know what he does he'll set in your soul
[47:41] come on he'll set in your
[47:43] soul and let you do something
[47:50] wrong to see what you'll
[47:53] do even brother Ram said he'll have one
[47:56] brother say something against you to see
[47:58] how you'll react now that sounds a
[48:01] little that sounds a little like
[48:04] provoking but now it's
[48:07] proving it's proving who you are we are
[48:10] going to prove who we are sir you're not
[48:14] going to be able to help
[48:15] it you're going to prove who you
[48:18] are you know why by who you
[48:21] are all right and how we react as
[48:24] brother B was talking about brother
[48:25] kindness and all the different things
[48:27] you just don't see that much there's not
[48:30] like if you take brotherly kindness and
[48:31] run it right down just like I did the
[48:33] other day that brother Bob did there's
[48:35] really not a lot of people that has
[48:36] brotherly
[48:44] kindness see the holy spirit is so timid
[48:47] how many knows that just real timid so
[48:49] he's just going to sit there and he's
[48:52] going to wait on you brother R said
[48:54] he'll go out on a limb he don't go out
[48:56] of your he don't go out of your body and
[48:58] go sit on the limb of a
[49:00] tree but in figurative he does you know
[49:04] but that's the only thing brother Brown
[49:05] could use as a as a example was that he
[49:08] withdraws himself until you get yourself
[49:11] straightened out you know why because
[49:13] that thing that thing this is your soul
[49:15] that thing can't stand
[49:17] sin that's why when you do do something
[49:19] wrong and something
[49:23] goes shouldn't have done that
[49:27] and then we wait a little bit later and
[49:29] like brother Dell says we make it your
[49:33] fault no I'm like brother Bob if I've
[49:36] said anything to offend you forgive me I
[49:39] really really don't want
[49:43] anything against me if we have to go
[49:47] across that
[49:48] other cross that curtain of time brother
[49:51] BR said death does what doesn't change
[49:54] you that's right changes your Dwelling
[49:57] Place if you Harbor feelings here how
[49:59] you going to go
[50:04] there can't do
[50:06] it so any Interruption bothers him
[50:09] that's why we don't talk all in church
[50:12] all as you know just a a you know hello
[50:15] brother God bless you or changing of the
[50:17] tombs or whatever up here but no no
[50:19] conversation man you go to a Baptist
[50:21] Church we went to one not very long ago
[50:24] year or so ago and it was just like a
[50:26] lodge you walked in the back and they're
[50:28] leaning up against you know the're
[50:30] leaning up inside right here and they're
[50:31] talking back and forth and everybody's
[50:33] Milling around talking it's just it
[50:35] sounds like Walmart you know it's just
[50:36] you hear
[50:38] voices and then about 5 minutes before
[50:41] the 6:00 service starts they just kind
[50:43] of start migrating into a seat somewhere
[50:45] they never prayed they never done
[50:47] anything they talking about everything
[50:48] in the world well now okay where was the
[50:52] Holy
[50:53] Ghost it was G ging the ones of us that
[50:56] did have it when we walked in the
[50:58] door did it grieve them I'm not saying
[51:01] they don't have the Holy Ghost but it
[51:02] didn't grieve them because their
[51:04] Doctrine said they could do
[51:08] that that's the doctrine God
[51:11] hates that's why brother ramam said make
[51:13] it cold formal and Powerless cuz he's
[51:15] not even in those denominations anymore
[51:17] he's trying to pull people out yes they
[51:19] will be foolish virgins yes there'll be
[51:21] people giving eternal life but there are
[51:23] no bride in the denom ational
[51:29] system well I say Amen because look at
[51:32] it look at
[51:36] it but God promised he would restore
[51:38] how's he going to restore he's going to
[51:40] restore through a Ministry fivefold
[51:41] Ministry that gives it to the people and
[51:44] then they eat and become what that
[51:46] Ministry talks about that's and you go
[51:49] through all these stages let's just get
[51:50] through that because you know I'm
[51:51] metamorphis I want to start right here
[51:54] let's talk about your soul just for me
[51:57] put everything
[51:59] away put the chicken
[52:02] away Bob just had to say mashed potatoes
[52:05] put the mashed potatoes
[52:08] away put the macaroni and cheese away
[52:11] that's three favorites so put them
[52:14] away let's talk about this just for a
[52:16] minute then we'll eat all that when we
[52:17] go downstairs all right God says behold
[52:21] look All Souls are mine he didn't say
[52:23] all
[52:24] spirits he didn't say all
[52:27] bodies he said All Souls are mine right
[52:31] all right as the soul of the father so
[52:34] also the soul of the son is
[52:39] mine then he sums this whole thing up
[52:41] and says the soul that
[52:44] sinth it shall die didn't say the body
[52:48] didn't say the spirit said the soul that
[52:51] sinth now what is a soul let's look at
[52:53] the Hebrew lexan we've been through this
[52:55] many many times before but we got some
[52:57] new ones and we got some that need to
[52:58] really hear this I need to really hear
[53:00] it cuz I'm the one that put it in here
[53:02] just a few minutes ago cuz I thought man
[53:03] I need to listen to this too your soul
[53:07] is yourself now look hold on just a
[53:10] minute there's a spirit of humanity all
[53:14] right there's a spirit because animals
[53:18] have a
[53:19] spirit they can function they see taste
[53:22] feel smell and hear they have memory
[53:25] they have reasoning conscious
[53:27] affection but not in the
[53:29] soul everybody with me because they
[53:32] can't per it's not a person it's not an
[53:35] individual to me uh you look at deer and
[53:38] you look at all that that's nature
[53:40] that's God that's God's nature moving
[53:43] through animals and he said it was good
[53:46] in the Garden of
[53:48] Eden they can procreate and it's
[53:52] good but me and you can't just procreate
[53:56] anytime we want to cuz we have a soul
[53:59] there's something that's going to be
[54:00] judged those animals are never going to
[54:02] be judged never will they be judged
[54:04] that's right all right the reason they
[54:06] are what they are now because they're
[54:08] eating each other and getting killed on
[54:09] the highway is because of
[54:11] who
[54:14] you when Adam fell everything above look
[54:17] when Adam fell now this is not Christ I
[54:20] mean but Adam was the Apex he was The
[54:23] Headstone of the human
[54:25] race
[54:28] amen he fell cuz he wasn't the savior of
[54:32] the human race but he was the head of
[54:34] the human race he had power on
[54:37] everything on Earth he had
[54:40] power he was given that
[54:43] power but he traded it to save his
[54:47] bride okay Jesus Christ same way he had
[54:52] power over everything and he give it
[54:54] away to get his bride then he's the only
[54:58] one that can save us and he's the only
[54:59] one who can come back up and say all
[55:00] power in Heaven and Earth given unto me
[55:01] he goes right back to be The Headstone
[55:03] again cuz remember he was the Chief
[55:06] Cornerstone to build the human race to
[55:08] build us the bride he became down
[55:11] here that was that was cut off that was
[55:14] done away with they rejected the man
[55:17] standing there that could save them
[55:20] all but there's a group of people that's
[55:22] going to be his body his bride body that
[55:26] he's going to build and then he's going
[55:28] to be happy to be in us and set right
[55:30] down on top of us all right be our
[55:34] head praise the
[55:36] Lord so let's look at this just for a
[55:39] minute strong concordance soul is self
[55:43] life creature person appetite mind
[55:49] living being desire emotion and passion
[55:52] all right now
[55:53] look that which breathe the breathing
[55:56] substance being Soul the inner being of
[55:59] a man now when a soul leaves a man what
[56:01] happens he quits
[56:05] breathing and you look and and I want to
[56:07] try to explain this and
[56:09] not not hurt anybody's feelings because
[56:12] death is not a good thing as far as the
[56:14] way we look at
[56:15] it because it's a separation it's a gap
[56:18] we've all you know we're intertwined
[56:19] together and we've we we you I've been
[56:21] with Brother house since since I was
[56:23] about 8 or nine years old and we fished
[56:25] and we hunted we all went to to the uh
[56:28] fishing thing um with the Father's
[56:31] day but that part's
[56:34] gone that part's gone never to come back
[56:37] like that
[56:39] again
[56:42] okay but now
[56:44] look that which breathes the breathing
[56:46] substance when brother how was was
[56:49] passing from this life to the next life
[56:51] something happened in his
[56:53] body to release that
[56:57] Soul what happens when somebody dies
[56:59] they die because they can't keep their
[57:01] soul inside their
[57:05] body that not what death is your soul
[57:08] leaves your body because there's
[57:10] something I am now functioning my soul
[57:13] is functioning my body is functioning
[57:15] and my spirit's functioning because
[57:17] everything's working together everybody
[57:19] with me don't go to sleep this is your
[57:22] soul it's worth 10,000 words worlds
[57:25] words and
[57:27] worlds but something inside of you has
[57:30] has stopped when your heart stops your
[57:33] soul leaves your
[57:35] body
[57:38] right when you stop breathing when you
[57:40] can't breathe when different things
[57:41] happen to
[57:42] you that's why that soul is so important
[57:45] but it's also important to make sure you
[57:47] keep the other guy outside Guy Healthy
[57:49] too I know you know bodily exercise
[57:52] doesn't profit much but it does help to
[57:54] do a little a little bit to keep that
[57:55] thing back together right sister Ruth
[57:58] she said praise the
[58:01] Lord but living being living being look
[58:05] with life in the blood I keep going the
[58:08] man himself so he the the definition has
[58:11] come to because a living being is a is a
[58:13] deer a deer is a living being but it's
[58:15] not a living
[58:17] person all right it's not something that
[58:19] you named well some we do name our pets
[58:22] so but it's a living being with life in
[58:24] the blood but it's not a
[58:28] man it's not himself it's not a person
[58:31] it's not an
[58:33] individual it's the seed of your
[58:36] appetite it
[58:38] is seed of emotions and
[58:42] passions look activity of mind all right
[58:48] activity of the will so see that stops
[58:51] all animals animals do not have a will
[58:54] right they are controlled by Nature they
[58:57] do the same thing all the time unless we
[59:01] mess it up and build a road through
[59:02] their hunting property where they go
[59:05] hunting
[59:06] at that's why we hit a lot of deer and
[59:09] things and kill them the activity of the
[59:12] will look activity of the
[59:15] character you know you you look at a
[59:17] little dog and a little dog he'll
[59:19] develop some kind of a little character
[59:20] but he's not a
[59:22] person he's not going to look at you one
[59:25] day and say no I don't want to do that
[59:28] but now your kid when it's born it's
[59:30] going to look at you one day and say no
[59:32] I don't want to do
[59:34] that
[59:38] right somebody said one day said you
[59:41] know um um a little bitty small
[59:44] kitten will walk across this right here
[59:46] like this and look over that way and
[59:49] look over that way and walk around never
[59:52] will fall
[59:53] off but you put a baby right here that
[59:57] baby gonna fall off all right so there
[1:00:00] but so but what I'm saying is that
[1:00:01] they're controlled by a nature that's
[1:00:03] that's a little different than
[1:00:06] ours we've got to develop one yeah that
[1:00:11] cat can
[1:00:12] jump move all those other animals they
[1:00:15] can do things superhuman sometimes and
[1:00:17] then the baby's like help me you
[1:00:21] know so it's the activity of a character
[1:00:23] so watch this
[1:00:26] this is brother brandham now now we're
[1:00:28] look we're talking about Saul Now what
[1:00:29] went across a curtain of time when
[1:00:32] brother Brown said I stepped across the
[1:00:34] curtain of time he said I looked back
[1:00:37] and saw
[1:00:38] what my body and it was moving so it
[1:00:42] wasn't dead right it it was
[1:00:46] moving he made that pretty plane it was
[1:00:49] moving all right so when he stepped
[1:00:52] across a curtain of time what was what
[1:00:54] stepped across it was the real him his
[1:00:58] soul but when he stepped across that
[1:01:00] curtain of time like I said before he
[1:01:02] wasn't just something that you hang up
[1:01:04] in the closet and wait till the other
[1:01:06] parts come together no he had memory
[1:01:08] reason conscious effects and Imagination
[1:01:11] all those people had memor re and cons
[1:01:13] because watch this and the voice that
[1:01:15] was above me said this is something like
[1:01:17] Jacob when he had gathered with his
[1:01:19] people just then I looked and men were
[1:01:22] coming oh by the groups knocking each
[1:01:23] other out of the away and no by the
[1:01:26] groups brotherly
[1:01:29] kindness millions of them oh
[1:01:33] my and they were
[1:01:35] running throwing their arms around me
[1:01:38] and screaming my precious brother they
[1:01:40] knew who he
[1:01:43] was and Ma you know I was married before
[1:01:46] and my wife died Billy's mother that's
[1:01:49] the reason Billy and I stick together
[1:01:51] she died when he was 18 months old his
[1:01:54] little sister sister was 8 months old
[1:01:55] she died with a mother I've been poing
[1:01:57] Mama to Billy and I seen hope coming
[1:02:00] working her way through the crowd now he
[1:02:02] is standing in his theophany is
[1:02:04] everybody with me he's standing in his
[1:02:07] soul and his soul is going that's my
[1:02:12] wife
[1:02:14] right he's thinking that's my
[1:02:18] wife she's on this
[1:02:21] side heading toward him not saying
[1:02:24] that's my
[1:02:26] husband cuz she had broke through he was
[1:02:28] he was kind of in between she had broke
[1:02:31] through and was completely in this realm
[1:02:34] but she knew he was a brother and she
[1:02:36] had no problem brother rown said she did
[1:02:39] what oh I thought surely she'll call me
[1:02:41] her husband and when she got close to me
[1:02:44] see I could see her bless her heart
[1:02:45] blackhair German girl you know black
[1:02:47] hair she threw her arms around me she
[1:02:49] said my darling
[1:02:51] brother I thought I don't understand
[1:02:54] this
[1:02:55] there's another woman just a girl put
[1:02:57] her arms around me and said my precious
[1:02:58] brother and she hugged this woman and
[1:03:00] said think of it look now look think of
[1:03:02] it he's finally arrived with
[1:03:08] us they must have knew he was
[1:03:11] coming he's finally arrived with us
[1:03:15] these men they picked me up so they knew
[1:03:18] who brother random was they picked him
[1:03:21] up and set me upon a little place like
[1:03:23] this I saidh is this he said in Earth
[1:03:27] you was a
[1:03:29] leader I said I don't understand it just
[1:03:31] then the voice spoke to me and said this
[1:03:33] is when you gather with your people I
[1:03:36] said when I die you mean this is what
[1:03:38] I'll be yes I said oh why do I ever fear
[1:03:41] this this is wonderful oh my just
[1:03:44] perfection that won't reach it
[1:03:47] superb that wouldn't reach it there's
[1:03:49] not words in the English dialect that
[1:03:51] could reach it God knows why I'm telling
[1:03:53] this from my heart it happened so those
[1:03:55] people were aware with with their senses
[1:03:59] but they must have known in their self
[1:04:01] who brother brandom was cuz they came
[1:04:04] there under his ministry cuz I I cut
[1:04:06] some of that out but brother Bram said
[1:04:08] are these all

[1:04:11] are your con your converts not Paul's
[1:04:14] not Peter's not Billy Graham not all
[1:04:18] Roberts these are your converts in other
[1:04:21] words they heard his message and
[1:04:24] accepted
[1:04:25] God accepted Christ as their savior
[1:04:28] under his ministry and they knew that
[1:04:32] he's finally arrived they've been
[1:04:33] looking for
[1:04:36] him that's in the soul
[1:04:40] yes brother Brown tells us I don't have
[1:04:42] this I'm just going to read it 1957 I
[1:04:44] already shut my computer and I pulled
[1:04:46] this off but brother Brown says look

[1:04:53] an altar this altar I want them to come
[1:04:56] right on I'm waiting for you my dear
[1:04:58] friend oh this little body of yours is

[1:05:04] 10,000 worlds now listen to what he says
[1:05:07] though this is healing on a higher
[1:05:12] level this is eternal
[1:05:16] healing he's talking about your new
[1:05:18] birth Eternal healing is the healing of
[1:05:20] the Soul you don't have to do that by
[1:05:21] one time cuz it continues on he said
[1:05:23] look if a man gets healed here at the
[1:05:25] platform he's going to get sick again if
[1:05:28] he lives long enough but if a man gets
[1:05:30] saved he's got everlasting life and we
[1:05:33] raised up in the last day there's your
[1:05:35] difference this is eternal healing he
[1:05:38] said this is eternal I believe he said
[1:05:40] this is eternal healing this is
[1:05:42] temporary
[1:05:44] healing all
[1:05:46] right now
[1:05:48] listen one soul is worth 10,000 worlds
[1:05:52] then God said All Souls are mine
[1:05:55] I'm here to protect cuz what's going to
[1:05:56] go to the day of judgment sure listen
[1:05:59] we're not but the ones that do have to
[1:06:01] go to the Judgment their soul everything
[1:06:04] they got goes there but God's going to
[1:06:06] judge their soul because their soul
[1:06:09] emanated out through their come on
[1:06:11] somebody through their spirit in their
[1:06:12] body and it made them react in a way not
[1:06:17] godly but it all emanated from the
[1:06:19] soul all right now I know there's a lot
[1:06:22] we can talk about there but the soul is
[1:06:24] the most important thing I know brother
[1:06:26] R said you can go completely back crazy
[1:06:28] in your mind and commit suicide and your
[1:06:30] soul still be born again now remember
[1:06:32] that all right but I want you to realize
[1:06:37] something be careful with
[1:06:41] that look at the
[1:06:44] life we all have issues and problems we
[1:06:47] all let Devils get on us am I preaching
[1:06:49] to the same Crown we all that demons get
[1:06:51] a hold of us sometimes but you need to
[1:06:54] get rid of that thing in the name of the
[1:06:56] Lord
[1:06:57] Jesus you don't exactly have to call the
[1:06:59] pastor you don't exactly have to call a
[1:07:02] deacon you exactly have that in your
[1:07:05] hole right here in that hole called a
[1:07:06] mouth but it comes from whatever's
[1:07:08] inside now remember if Satan's inside
[1:07:11] here he can't cast himself
[1:07:15] out that's why brother Brown said
[1:07:17] they'll say Jesus Jesus and not get
[1:07:20] anything cuz Jesus wasn't in their
[1:07:22] soul he was you become an anointed one
[1:07:26] then an anointed one now let's talk
[1:07:27] about that just for a second before we
[1:07:28] get to this an anointed one what happens
[1:07:31] to him his soul has not been converted
[1:07:34] all
[1:07:35] right but he has been anointed he has
[1:07:38] entered a realm of God that God make
[1:07:42] listen God makes these promises by my
[1:07:44] stripes your heel that's to
[1:07:47] everybody Sinner and Saint brother B He
[1:07:49] he'll tell you he said Sinners will come
[1:07:51] by this platform and get healed and he
[1:07:53] said Saints will not get
[1:07:55] healed why because the Saints going oh I
[1:07:58] did this I did this to my neighbor all
[1:08:00] but a prostitute just walked up and said
[1:08:01] hey I believe what that guy says I
[1:08:04] believe what that guy says if he says
[1:08:05] I'm Healed then I'm Healed and listen
[1:08:06] God's Got A
[1:08:08] Healer right so you enter in listen that
[1:08:11] to me anointed ones is
[1:08:16] temporary we've been talking about it an
[1:08:17] ed ones is temporary but when you're the
[1:08:21] soul inside of you is God that's not an
[1:08:24] anointing that's right that's the birth
[1:08:27] that's where you're sealed until the day
[1:08:29] of your Redemption that's where God
[1:08:30] Burns you out and puts him
[1:08:34] in think about
[1:08:37] it think about what God did for
[1:08:41] you he gave you a new heart we've been
[1:08:43] talking about that he softens you
[1:08:47] up why so that he can the timid Holy
[1:08:50] Spirit can enter
[1:08:52] in amen you can't forget he's not timid
[1:08:55] all the time he is timid all the time
[1:08:57] all
[1:09:00] right so that's why this is important
[1:09:03] when we read second Peter 1 he's talking
[1:09:06] to your
[1:09:08] soul all right is everybody with me
[1:09:10] Peter's talking to the soul of man cuz
[1:09:13] you don't get the divine nature and
[1:09:14] divine power in your spirit realm
[1:09:18] right he's talking to your soul and
[1:09:22] Peter's a real good one to do that cuz
[1:09:24] he's he knows one thing on that day of
[1:09:26] Pentecost something got burned out of
[1:09:28] him and something got put in him amen so
[1:09:31] what better preacher that could go that
[1:09:33] went through all these emotions cursing
[1:09:35] and and you know all those things and
[1:09:37] then now he's trying to teach us how to
[1:09:39] have the divine nature of
[1:09:41] God grace and peace be multiplied to you
[1:09:44] through the knowledge of God and of
[1:09:45] Jesus our lord according to his divine
[1:09:47] power his
[1:09:50] soul the soul of God
[1:09:55] hath given unto us all things that
[1:09:56] pertain unto what life and
[1:09:59] godliness
[1:10:02] how through the knowledge of him that
[1:10:04] had called it who called you Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ called you to glory and virtue
[1:10:11] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:10:13] great and precious
[1:10:16] promises that by these promises what you
[1:10:18] might be divine part look be partakers
[1:10:21] of what someone's divine nature
[1:10:24] you were not born with a divine
[1:10:26] nature you were born with a
[1:10:31] nature all right God give you a soul
[1:10:34] permitted you to come here to give you a
[1:10:36] choice everybody with me but that you
[1:10:40] might be what partakers we can stand up
[1:10:42] here all day and talk about that good
[1:10:44] mashed potatoes and that good um chicken
[1:10:47] and all that good stuff downstairs and
[1:10:49] you know what if you're not allowed to
[1:10:51] go down there and eat it you just going
[1:10:54] to sit here and
[1:10:55] die but we can talk about it all we want
[1:11:01] to Talk's cheap when it's on
[1:11:03] paper you got to make it
[1:11:06] live Listen White paper's cheap and
[1:11:08] black Ink's
[1:11:11] cheap but when you got to make it live
[1:11:13] yes we going to go St downstairs and eat
[1:11:16] where are giving un us look at seed and
[1:11:18] great and precious promises that by
[1:11:19] these promises you might be partakers of
[1:11:22] the divine nature look having
[1:11:25] escaped you were bound you were in
[1:11:28] prison yes you were incarcerated yes you
[1:11:31] were put in the pawn
[1:11:34] shop you were
[1:11:37] dead you've escaped
[1:11:39] that how you had a nature
[1:11:42] change you had the devil's nature thrown
[1:11:45] out thrown out and God's nature put in
[1:11:49] that's what you have with a new birth
[1:11:52] you've escaped the corruption that is in
[1:11:54] the world through lust you've escaped
[1:11:56] going to judgment why because God's
[1:11:58] going to judge a soul
[1:12:01] right All Souls are
[1:12:03] mine it's the soul that sinth that
[1:12:06] dies right so he's judging
[1:12:10] souls he can't judge yours if you're
[1:12:13] born again CU it's him right it's so
[1:12:18] much him brother said one time it's so
[1:12:19] much him till you're exed
[1:12:21] out I mean you're completely
[1:12:24] gone the life that I now live I live by
[1:12:28] what the faith of the Son of God we must
[1:12:32] have the mind of Christ our problem is
[1:12:35] is we try to use ours a
[1:12:39] lot Romans 8:14 for as many as are led
[1:12:42] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[1:12:44] of God that's what I was telling
[1:12:46] yesterday you know we weren't just
[1:12:48] celebrating a life
[1:12:50] yesterday we were celebrating a son of
[1:12:53] God
[1:12:54] amen Born Again baptized with the Holy
[1:12:58] Ghost Son of God celebrating that life
[1:13:02] yes sure we talked about but see in all
[1:13:05] of our everything that we talked about
[1:13:07] about brother how it all culminated in
[1:13:10] that he was born again yes that's what I
[1:13:12] was telling him I said you can say all
[1:13:14] the good story I said it would be a
[1:13:15] different I didn't say this but it' be a
[1:13:17] different story if he was a rank Center
[1:13:21] come on it would oh yeah you could have
[1:13:24] real happy this and happy that but not
[1:13:27] somebody that held that people could say
[1:13:29] that work with him all those years that
[1:13:33] never seen a man like that Christian man
[1:13:36] oh yeah listen there people in that
[1:13:38] building that probably said I remember
[1:13:39] when brother Hal got mad and throw
[1:13:41] something so
[1:13:42] what that's the human
[1:13:45] part oh you don't do that but you need
[1:13:48] to go to another church and I don't
[1:13:51] think you're going to be able to find it
[1:13:55] cuz we do have issues we're not going to
[1:13:57] get into it we may get into it this
[1:13:58] afternoon when you come out of that
[1:14:00] Spirit realm is where you have your
[1:14:03] issues cuz listen one more time if your
[1:14:06] soul is the soul of God how can it have
[1:14:11] issues God don't have issues issues
[1:14:14] means problems we used to say it when we
[1:14:17] when we was at the chicken plant they
[1:14:19] say look don't say ever say problem say
[1:14:22] issues it's the same
[1:14:25] thing we have
[1:14:28] issues well that means we have
[1:14:32] problems but
[1:14:35] look brother how was a Son of God
[1:14:37] because of the new
[1:14:39] birth not really because he was a human
[1:14:42] daddy that's the human part that's what
[1:14:45] I want to tell you over here in the
[1:14:46] human part separate that part he was a
[1:14:48] daddy to Janet and and uh Debbie right
[1:14:52] but his saw he was a Son of God yes
[1:14:56] child of God
[1:14:58] yes and he received the spirit of
[1:15:01] adoption when he got born again but he
[1:15:02] didn't come to
[1:15:04] it am I with me sorry I man when you
[1:15:07] can't be adopted in
[1:15:11] heaven can't be
[1:15:13] adopted in
[1:15:15] heaven you got to have these virtues why
[1:15:18] Peter stood one day and he said add yes
[1:15:22] to your
[1:15:24] faith right here yes sir right now add
[1:15:27] to your faith
[1:15:29] virtue knowledge Temperance here yes in
[1:15:34] other words your walk Peter said our
[1:15:36] walk has got to be the Walk of that man
[1:15:40] that I walked with for three and a half
[1:15:42] years and didn't understand
[1:15:48] him but I want to be like Peter I really
[1:15:52] do
[1:15:54] I really do cuz Jesus looked at Peter
[1:15:57] and said Peter I prayed for
[1:16:00] you I know Satan's going to sift you
[1:16:03] like s because of your
[1:16:08] nature Satan's going to bother you
[1:16:10] because of who you are so I'm going to
[1:16:13] pray for
[1:16:14] you I'm going to let you know you may
[1:16:17] not know it now but I know in my mind
[1:16:19] from back before the foundational world
[1:16:21] you're going to preach a sermon
[1:16:22] Hallelujah in second
[1:16:26] Peter there's going to be a sermon
[1:16:28] preached that's going to help not just
[1:16:30] your little
[1:16:33] handful but thousands and millions of
[1:16:37] people wow and Peter's going I fight for
[1:16:41] you
[1:16:42] Lord
[1:16:45] I didn't even understand what he and
[1:16:48] Jesus I'm praying for you Peter I know
[1:16:49] what you're going to do I'm you're going
[1:16:52] to cuss three times times you're going
[1:16:53] to deny me that you don't even know
[1:16:55] me come on and you going to come up and
[1:16:59] get all full of yourself and you going
[1:17:00] to take this sword instead of this sword
[1:17:02] you going to take and whack that guy's
[1:17:03] ear
[1:17:06] off but I prayed for you
[1:17:10] Peter I prayed for you put your name in
[1:17:15] there for you have not received the
[1:17:17] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[1:17:18] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:17:20] whereby you cry father father in other
[1:17:23] words your soul is redeemed you've rece
[1:17:26] you you're into the family of God now
[1:17:27] listen as brother Dell said many many
[1:17:29] years ago Satan I mean God does not
[1:17:32] adopt Satan's kids so you got to get
[1:17:33] into the family before you can get
[1:17:35] adopted all right that's why we'll read
[1:17:37] here T this afternoon that your adoption
[1:17:39] and your birth is two different things
[1:17:42] now you receive the spirit of adoption
[1:17:44] you're
[1:17:45] Peter you're in
[1:17:47] line but you got to get in
[1:17:50] family Peter you're in line I'm going to
[1:17:52] use you I'm going to pray for
[1:17:55] you but until you get the Holy Ghost
[1:17:58] you're not in my
[1:18:00] kingdom listen only kingdom of God is
[1:18:02] the people the the the children of God
[1:18:06] right which you have received the spirit
[1:18:09] of adoption Spirit itself look bearing
[1:18:11] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:18:14] children of God now this is Peter
[1:18:17] talking the spirit itself bearing
[1:18:20] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:18:23] children of God and if children then
[1:18:26] heirs HS of God and join HS with Christ
[1:18:29] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:18:30] may be also
[1:18:32] glorified
[1:18:34] together we're still now remember look
[1:18:37] now we're still in the soul because when
[1:18:40] you become born again you're a newborn
[1:18:42] babe the Bible says in
[1:18:47] Christ but
[1:18:49] listen that's why I wanted to pull this
[1:18:51] apart a little bit we'll stop right here
[1:18:52] and we'll just pick it up this
[1:18:55] afternoon when you're born again in your
[1:18:59] soul I believe God changes your soul to
[1:19:02] an 18y old child person person do I get
[1:19:05] an amen you not believe I do listen
[1:19:09] that's my hope that's my driving force
[1:19:12] that there's something inside of me
[1:19:13] different than what it was
[1:19:15] before and the life that I now live
[1:19:19] yes but that newborn babe is the second
[1:19:22] realm
[1:19:25] your Soul's not a
[1:19:27] baby Hey listen even in that whole
[1:19:31] analogy there with brother Braham going
[1:19:32] across a curtain of time in another
[1:19:35] Vision that he had he saw
[1:19:37] who Sharon Rose Sharon Rose was six
[1:19:41] months old when she
[1:19:44] died brother maram said who are
[1:19:48] you she was a grown woman
[1:19:51] right
[1:19:53] we're not going to have babies running
[1:19:55] around in heaven nothing against
[1:19:57] children you have them down here brother
[1:19:59] call laugh you have them down here but
[1:20:02] you want to grow up too don't you
[1:20:03] brother that's right you want to grow up
[1:20:07] but as newborn babes that's what we'll
[1:20:08] get to this afternoon when you come when
[1:20:10] you become born again you're you're an
[1:20:13] 18y old person and listen the only thing
[1:20:17] that's hindering you is what the next
[1:20:20] realm your spirit Realm right your your
[1:20:23] spirit realm was a
[1:20:26] baby you have a
[1:20:29] birth you have a birth it's
[1:20:32] God birth it's got to work its way
[1:20:36] listen you're contrary to God the Bible
[1:20:38] says you're born contrary to
[1:20:41] God so it and it doesn't I I just wish
[1:20:45] it changed my spirit realm but it is now
[1:20:49] through a
[1:20:50] journey of test and trial
[1:20:53] tribulations why so that we can love God
[1:20:58] more so we can love God more that he's
[1:21:00] took us from a baby where we didn't know
[1:21:03] how to excuse me we didn't know how to
[1:21:07] handle that soul that was inside of us
[1:21:10] cuz we weren't born with that kind of a
[1:21:12] person we were born with the nature of
[1:21:15] whatever you
[1:21:16] got contrary to God now the Bible didn't
[1:21:19] AB it's
[1:21:21] contrary there's nothing about you
[1:21:25] good until you're born again nothing
[1:21:27] about you
[1:21:29] nothing so now you've went through your
[1:21:32] life being
[1:21:35] worthless but you get up to whatever age
[1:21:37] you got to New Birth you get the new
[1:21:39] birth well now listen your body is not
[1:21:41] going to automatically get younger I
[1:21:42] wish you would your body is not going to
[1:21:44] automatically get younger and your
[1:21:46] spirit realm's not going to know how to
[1:21:48] handle that new person inside of
[1:21:50] you so the newborn bab part Desiring the
[1:21:55] sere milk of the word that what that you
[1:21:57] may grow not that you get now brother
[1:21:59] Ram had to give us an analogy we'll
[1:22:00] close right here he said it's like a
[1:22:02] little button remember didn't you
[1:22:03] remember that it's like a little button
[1:22:05] that comes into you at a new birth and
[1:22:06] then it
[1:22:08] grows well I I I believe that but that
[1:22:11] was his analogy of trying to tell you
[1:22:13] that your second realm was so much
[1:22:17] against it
[1:22:20] still am I with we are we okay
[1:22:23] that Spirit realm didn't know how don't
[1:22:25] know how to handle that
[1:22:27] soul and that's where the fight is
[1:22:30] that's where the newborn babe is the
[1:22:32] newborn babe is the second real
[1:22:36] guy listen how can you have God inside
[1:22:40] of you and then him not be all
[1:22:43] knowing God's all knowing all the time
[1:22:47] and the part that you get of him is not
[1:22:49] less
[1:22:51] knowing
[1:22:54] Hallelujah that's why musicians come
[1:22:57] that's why we have had so much trouble
[1:22:59] since the day of
[1:23:01] Pentecost we have not been able to
[1:23:05] realize the Body Spirit soul and their
[1:23:10] function even Paul tells us he said I
[1:23:12] wish that your whole body Soul and
[1:23:15] Spirit be
[1:23:18] Sanctified got to start somewhere though
[1:23:21] got to start by a new birth that's why
[1:23:23] they call it new new birth right newborn
[1:23:27] babes you don't know how to handle this
[1:23:30] new birth this new thing you got inside
[1:23:32] of you cuz listen you were dead and
[1:23:37] lost now you're healed and
[1:23:40] eternal in your
[1:23:42] soul can't have a new
[1:23:47] thought can't change or it's not
[1:23:51] God everybody with me so where is the
[1:23:54] change part it's in your spirit realm
[1:23:56] we'll talk about that that's where
[1:23:57] you're a newborn
[1:23:59] babe CU you take
[1:24:01] a you take a person
[1:24:03] that let's wait do this afternoon we we
[1:24:06] let's sing a song we'll do it this
[1:24:08] afterno it'll take too long to explain
[1:24:10] that but a newborn baby Desiring the
[1:24:12] Sensi milk of the word what's happening
[1:24:14] is that Dynamo that's inside of you that
[1:24:16] soul that now is all of God and you
[1:24:19] together
[1:24:21] vulcanized and when he vulcanize
[1:24:23] remember what happens can't tell the
[1:24:25] difference can't pull them

[1:27:12] more like
[1:27:15] thee is that your desire make me more
[1:27:18] like thee cuz we're born
[1:27:21] contrary but when you get the new birth
[1:27:23] you get that little spark that you need
[1:27:26] start listening to that listen if it
[1:27:28] leads you in wrong it ain't God pretty
[1:27:31] simple that's why I believe we have
[1:27:32] Satan's answer cuz see Satan would say
[1:27:35] no well that's that that's you know you
[1:27:38] no we know what happens in the soul we
[1:27:40] know what happens in the spirit realm we
[1:27:42] know how they're connected by our
[1:27:44] natural environment
[1:27:47] right but if you're born again in your
[1:27:49] soul folks Satan can't touch your soul
[1:27:53] he cannot touch your soul that's one
[1:27:55] thing he can't get his grimy hands on he
[1:27:57] cannot get his grimy hands on your soul
[1:27:59] if he touches your soul it's going to be
[1:28:01] hotter than he'll ever get in hell right
[1:28:04] cuz you're a Dynamo that's the Eternal
[1:28:05] that's the man that created the world
[1:28:08] living inside of you sometimes we we
[1:28:11] belittle the new birth that we have it's
[1:28:12] the greatest thing brother R said you'll
[1:28:14] ever have it's to get born again and
[1:28:18] then let that life out even the Bible
[1:28:21] tells says why hide it under a
[1:28:24] bushel why hide it in a basket let it
[1:28:29] out let's sing it one more time live
[1:28:33] your life through me is that your desire
[1:28:40] Jesus
