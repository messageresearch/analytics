a methan lab had been found in an old farmhouse in the ad joint joining County and he asked one he asked me a rectorial question why didn't we have a drug problem when you and I was growing up I replied I had a drug problem when I was young I was drugged to church on Sunday morning I was drugged to church for weddings and funerals I was drugged to family reunions and Community socials no matter the weather I was drugged by my ears when I was disrespectful to adults I was drugged to the Woodshed when I disobeyed my parents to a lie brought home a bad report card did not speak with respect spoke ill of the teacher or the preacher or if I didn't put forth my best effort in everything that was asked to me I was drugged to the kitchen sink to have my mouth washed out with s i utter a profanity I was drugg out to pour weeds and Mom's Gardens and flower beds and cucker barels out of Dad's Fields I was drugged to the homes of family family friends and neighbors to help out some poor soul who had no one to mow the yard repair the clothesline or chop some firewood and if my mother had ever known that I took a single dime as a tip for this kindness she would have drugged me back to the Woodshed these drugs are still in my veins and they have a different they have an effect on my behavior and everything I do or say or think they are stronger than cocaine crack or herin and if the day children had this kind of drug problem America would be a better place God bless the parents who drugged us amen so I thought that was good Hallelujah if you have your Bibles turn to

John 10:25 and it says Jesus answered them I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe me not because you are not of my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father are one let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we love you with all that's within our hearts

guess this is more water right that's all right if I drink out of somebody else or whatever amen amen I like to read that again verse 25 and I just want to hit on verse 25 and 26 and this morning and maybe uh 27 and 28 tonight if that' be all right verse 25 after Amplified it reads like this Jesus answered them I have told you so yet you do not believe me man can you imagine that he said I told you so but yet you do not believe me oh I want to believe him this morning I don't want to just believe him with my lips but I want it to come from way down here amen he said you I told you I told you so yet you do not believe me you you do not trust me and rely on me if there ever was somebody I wanted to trust this morning that him amen Amen Brother P I can't put my confidence in anything else amen cuz everything else is running out amen I can't put my confidence in the in the economic situation because it's running out amen I can't put my trust in politics cuz it's rotten only thing I can put my trust in is God this morning and that's who I want to put my trust in and I want to believe him from the bottom of my heart I want to trust him this morning and I want to rely on him amen cuz he will see me through through amen I cannot see myself through amen you cannot see me through but he can see us all through if we just put our trust and confidence in him this morning he'll see us through amen he he didn't not a promise that we he see us around the trial over the trial or under the trial but he promised that he'd see us through our trials and our battles and our and our besetting he said he he promised that he'd be with us hallelujah amen he amen amen amen the very works that I do he said by by the power of my father and in my father's name bear witness concerning me amen he said the works that I do they bear witness of who I am oh I wonder this morning we may say we're bride but I wonder our life testifies this morning that we are bride amen I don't want to just say I'm bride but I want my life to testify that I am right amen I want my very actions to testify that I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God oh yes right amen my very actions amen my very life amen I want to be a part Christ in me and me in Christ right amen hallelujah he said they bear witness concerning me they are my credentials and evidence amen they're my credentials amen I don't have a PhD or a ddl or whatever but my credentials is that the word of God testifies of Who I Am The Works that I do they testify amen I might not been to a college or or got some kind of Seminary degree but the life that I live Bears witness of who I am this morning amen that life that bears witness of me amen my credentials they're my credentials and evidence and support of me and verse 26 like like this but you do not believe and trust and rely on me because you do not belong to my fold can you imagine he said but you don't amen believe in me why cuz you do not belong to my f you are no sheep of mine amen let me read you what the prophet said he said here he said he said any man he said they'll run into a basement and hide and refuse the sunlight and they said they'd rather live in darkness he said there's something mentally wrong with that person amen and so now this morning we have the light of the word of God Amen and if we refuse that light amen said we rather live in darkness then there's something wrong with us this morning amen I don't want to be like that guy he refuses the sunlight he said there's no such a thing and he runs down there into the bank you said well he he's crazy something's wrong with him upstairs amen so he refuses he said I don't believe in so I'm going down and I'm going to live in the basement and he rather live in dark but I don't want to be live cuz I'm not a a child gness I'm a Child of Light this morning and I want light amen and light is the only thing that's going to guide my path right hallelujah amen amen it a God my past amen he he runs back in a man that he can see the word of God Amen and he can see that it's true amen he can take this word and he can see that it's true amen then he said he'd rather run back into this domination denominational creats and live in darkness when he sees that the the word of God is is is uh is true then something's wrong with them spiritually right amen I'm saying God you that we sung that song Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord amen let me see you then once I see you Lord let me be led by that amen let me be led by that word Lord let me be led by your Holy Spirit Lord amen once I see you amen no wonder we got so many denominations today right amen what did they do they that little wrote out their little uh manuscrip and put a period on there and God said God it's only this and put a period on there and then God couldn't move when God decided to move on they said right there because they put a but God I don't want to put a period on God I said God you open my eyes this morning and there's more for me you reveal it to me and let me be faithful and walk in that right walk in the light is he is the light and be faithful when he reveals something to you walk in there right amen and you're faithful to walk walk in that then he'll reveal more to you you can walk in what he's revealed to you that's right amen that's what I want to do this morning amen just walk in the light as he is the light amen and the only way I can do that is have him living in me that's right amen I can become him and he become me he became me that I might become him by Grace amen hallelujah I'm glad that he became me that I might become him he who know knew no sin became sin that's right amen that I might become the very righteousness of God amen amen oh my hallelujah amen listen what he says but Jesus said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me for the works than that the father's given me to do they testify who I am amen any man the Son of God God testifies The Works that he's that he's ordained to do if he does the scripture don't back it up then leave it alone amen if the scripture don't back it up then leave it alone I'm saying God help me then this morning amen let me make sure that I'm walking in your word let me make sure that I got what it takes Amen on the inside of me to prove we your word by my life that I'm living that's right amen amen amen amen see cuz here it was he said you don't believe me amen why because you're not a part of me but I think it's like this amen when we come in contact with this unchangeable amen what this unchangeable this in irrefutable truth am when we come into contact with this unchangeable amen it don't change God don't change for nobody amen oh the denominations and all that they may vote here this and that amen they may say what's all right for women preachers amen but God done took his vot Hallelujah they may say well it's all right for homosexuals and all that but God done took his vote and when we come into contact with it's unchangeable that's right irrefutable I mean you can't refute it he me it's your refutable truth then it changes us if there's something in us to be changed amen he said when we come in contact there is no middle ground amen hallelujah there's no middle ground when we come into contact with there's no middle ground there's no stradle of theend uh Mir Rocky we either believe in him or we don't that's right amen can you imagine that here was that young guy in the Bible the Rich Young Ruler they call him he came in contact amen oh he might have seen cuz later on he tell we we'll get to that let me I'll just jump ahead of myself but he came in contact oh there was me he probably been to church before cuz he said to Jesus that he kept all the Commandments from his youth he was brought taught right amen had a nice family Sister Jude had a nice mom and dad that taught him right took him to Sunday school and all that and but there was still something missing something lacking and when he came in contact with This Man Called Jesus he knew there was something different about him it wasn't just any runof-the-mill preachers that he had seen right there was something different why because he came in contact with irrefutable truth unchangeable truth right and then he had to make a decision amen amen cuz the Bible says he ran amen and said good Master there must have been something pulling at him Amen brother dick cuz he ran the scripture says and the Bible says he ran and said good Master what must I do to be saved amen what must I do amen he wanted brother Ryan he wanted to know amen there was something amen he came into contact with this irreputable truth truth amen and something took place only something happened and he said what can I what must I do and when Jesus told him said keep all the Commandments he said I kept these from all my you but God but Jesus being that God Prophet looked into his life and said you lack one thing he said go and sell all th has and give to the poor and come and take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in glory amen you have Treasures in Heaven but something happened amen he could not am lay aside amen that weight that was tendering him amen even though he came in contact with it think about it this morning amen when we come in contact and we realize that this is the truth amen that this word of God Amen is irrefutable what are we going to do that's right that's right amen that's right what are me and you going to do amen amen amen oh he had to build bigger barns amen cuz he kept on but later we find out his identification was that the scripture says he lifted up his eyes and hell and cried being in torment why because instead amen he could not he could not Str the offence he can say well and I don't know if the Lord would have made him give up all that maybe the Lord just wanted to see where his heart was amen see where his motives was see what his objective was amen oh I hope our heart is right this morning I hope our motives is right this morning rejected of right are right this morning Lord amen bless hallelujah amen and he couldn't stradle the fence no more amen he couldn't stand the he couldn't stand neutral no more he had to make up in his mind this is either the truth and I'm going to live it amen I'm going to serve him or this is not the truth and I'm going to walk away from it and he walked away from it God help us this morning that's right amen amen help us this morning right amen see whenever truth is presented to a person they produce one of two reactions amen the first reaction is that that is that the soul and search of God responds posit positively and promptly right that so is a search for God right it comes in contact amen amen and the first reaction is it responds promptly and positively amen there's an immediate move toward the truth amen hey I believe this is the truth and I'm going to lay everything aside I'm going to take up my cross and I'm going to fall this cuz I know there's something in here are pulling me toward death amen I can't straddle the fence no more amen this is UN unchangeable it's irrefutable and I can't St V nor I got to follow this righten amen it's responding in a positive the way it's responding promply amen oh my and what else does it do amen there's immediate move amen toward the truth that they become a vital

it's a final part of my life right God help me this morning that's right amen I think of these things amen amen let me just share this with you real quick what they had a subject they was talking on

black as oh God help me this morning amen I want to make sure that my life corresponds with this word of God right hallelujah amen this word of God is God's mirror I want to look at it make sure I got every hair in place make sure I got the wedding garment on Amen that wedding garment is the word of God God right amen cuz he said he's going to have a church God said he said I didn't say it brother way didn't say it amen God brother didn't say it but God say that he was going to have a church amen without smar wrinkle that's right amen and if he said he's going to have one then he's going to have one that's right whether you're a part of it or I'm a part of it God's still going to have one that's right amen amen so what mean you need to do is become a part of it he said how do I become a

me in Christ that's right hallelujah oh my help me Lord amen amen amen amen amen they change amen it changes and conditions of person until he is formed to Christ amen that's the first reaction the second the second reaction like I said one or two reactions when they come into when it whenever truth is presented that first reaction you know it becomes a part of their life they respond to it amen and then that it's God's life amen moving into human character and it actually changes and conditions a person until he is formed into Christ right amen the seual reaction is the opposite amen it's a negative reaction amen it's a rejection of Truth and a rejection of Christ right thank you I don't want to reject him this morning but if he's come to you and he spoke to your heart respond to him amen amen respond to the poor amen amen oh God help us amen see this was true in his days upon the earth when he was here upon the Earth the same as it is today that c called him a devil they did the same spirit that is today they called him a devil amen they schemed to destroy him amen finally they hung him on a cross and they thought my that's that we'll get rid of it amen we'll get rid of it

amen amen John 3:16 Says for God so loved the world that he gave that's right amen that he gave how that he gave right God help me Amen to give amen help me to give that way they should have realized who he was amen they should have realized amen when he even when he even came back and he was walking on the road to M they didn't know cuz he kind of withheld their eyes their eyes hadn't become open yet amen and they said hey ain't you just a stranger cuz he asked him say why is your countenance so sad why is every why you look so gri and everything and your head's hung down they said oh you don't you know you're just a stranger here and you don't know what's been going on and Jesus said what things like he didn't know amen they said well you know we thought hey this was going to be the kingdom was going to be restored to this time and how they came and they took our master and they told him all that we thought he was a fulfillment this and how they hung it on the cross Lu the third day and Jesus beginning at the prophet Moses amen begin to expound the scriptures to him concerning himself amen so don't you understand if you don't believe the scriptures hey Moses wrote about it amen Moses wrote about this amen and he said all fools and slow heart then they bid him to come by amen cuz he acted like and he done something that was kind of familiar how he broke back and the Bible says and their eyes became open oh God I want you to open my eyes this morning Lord and let me realize Lord when I see the things of the that's happening in the world see what's going on there is prophecy being fulfilled that I got to look lift out my head cuz my redemption's dra down amen that's right not a time to play Church it's not a time to play tily Wings it's a time to move for God that's right amen amen amen hallelujah see they should have realized who he was the scripture po spoke about him David Isaiah eel said he would come but they did not accept him amen they refused to believe him they rejected and reputed all that he said that's right repudiated all that he said but turn with me to Isaiah real quickly Isaiah 61 amen though they did that like I said they should have

looking to it amen listen what the prophet God said when the church he said the church has always been in the all scar of the Earth to the world hated by all people cast out in alleys anywhere they can live wandered about in deserts and wearing sheep skins and goat skins and was destitute and Afflicted and tormented yes those people that there how will our testimony stand up against theirs in

wickedness age when everything from Ephesus all the way ped up into this age every Spirit we got to combat it right and we will overcome amen he said there will be somebody that's going to overcome I am going to overcome I am a winner let me read you this listen what the prophet said when what's he speaking of the ritual of the church people come to church and say they have repented and are baptized into Christ taking on the name of the Lord Lord Jesus and they did that in the wilderness also Paul said that's what the Corinthians had done they come in and was baptized in the Christ took on Christ outwardly professionally but hadn't taken him on intellectually had accepted had taken him on intellectually had accepted him that's like a film I seen one time Martin Luther he said I got

hear I'll live it that's right amen until then I'll just be just be something I profess I don't want to be just a professor I want to be a possessor amen listen he said they take it on outwardly professionally had take but brother it's a lot more than intellectuals it goes beyond that it goes to a genuine birth not just a mental conception or an an emotional work but a birth an experience something that goes PM down deep into the heart and changes the innermost being that makes you do things you would not have done other words amen it makes you love those who are unlovable it makes you act different than you ever thought you would act and when situations arise it your anchor hallelujah oh God thank you Lord amen oh let it be to me this morning Christ in me and me in Christ he said when you do that it's by birth by that something goes Plumb down in the innermost be being that anchors there and when sit it makes you love those that are unlovable it makes you do things you would have never thought you would have done that's true it makes you act different than you ever thought you would act and when situations arise it's your anchor you don't have to wonder will I make it oh no it isn't whether I'll make it it's already made for me right hallelujah it's already made for me right amen man he said like that it's already made for me Christ in me has made it himself that's
