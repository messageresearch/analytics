something it'll things Begin to Fall in in the line don't they you think that if God can can create a world and create the universe by his word and can control the planets and things what can he can do with your life if you get in this objection to the word that God can control your life by the word we just want to read tonight from The Book of Revelation chapter four um and uh you know we were we were planning to be out of town this weekend but it looks like we'll be here hey everybody everybody up there got covered so they're like just stay stay where you are for now so but but keep that little group in prayer um they kind of been having a rough time with that so um it's you know it's a thing but we've gotta we've got a miracle working God that's on the scene but I want to um uh you're probably not going to be surprised what scripture I'm gonna preach from tonight we'll just preach from Revelation 4 again and and take a a little different angle maybe just speak on a Vindicated life amen Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather once more around your word Lord and come together Lord right here in the middle of the week and everybody's traveling from Far Lord to gather together and get a little encouragement and I pray God that you'll give him what they need tonight Lord Jesus that you'll speak something Lord it'll be helpful and edifying Lord it'll Lord power him through Lord Jesus and give them something to to know a little bit more of what we're doing here and how to get out of here we thank you Lord Jesus for your grace that you've given unto us in this hour Lord and we just invite you in to move Among Us Lord because Lord surely Lord we can teach your word but Lord it takes the spirit to Quicken it to us and make it a living reality Lord we just ask you Lord that you'll feel welcome here Among Us Lord and move to move in this place Lord and and just help us Grant it now Lord we ask your blessing on on your word and your name amen so in Revelation chapter 4 verse 1 it says after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you these things which must be hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one said on the throne now you think about what this what kind of scene this is opening up here I I just pray that we can really see the scene as the way that look at it like John looked at it that something's happening and he that set was to look upon like a Jasper and a sergeant Stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as we've been speaking the last few times I kind of talked on this scripture that that John Heard a Voice and you you think that John John after all that this church ages had been opened up and and uh in the last chapter that that John looked and he heard a he he saw a door was opened up in heaven and you know brother Brown will explain all these all these symbols to us that that uh that door was when when how you think about how how this situation that we're into tonight that you know you're down here in your carnality and you're you're you're going through life and you're you're you know maybe sitting here tonight you just start examining yourself and and you think think of all the problems you got and all the all the things that you don't like you don't like about yourself and you think well I wish that I could get rid of these things well God has made a way and you see John that's what really what John was looking at he's looking at that door that was opened up in heaven and how how are we going to get out of here tonight I I want to I you know there's problems in our lives and things that are wrong in our lives and things that need to be corrected and I thank God that he has given us a way to correct our fallen nature to correct our countenality correct everything about us and a way to to get out of here so that we can if we just looked at him look because Christ is the door Christ is the door and how do you get through the door it's through faith faith is the key that opens the door so how's John how did John get up through that door how are you and I going to get up through that doors Revelation a personal revelation to us of who Jesus Christ is and you see as Christ is revealed that as a side effect of that as Christ is revealed and because you're part of Christ you are revealed too so as he's being revealed then you are being revealed and then that gives you that's really what the seals are to do as the as Christ as God pulled the cover off of the whole thing then it begins to reveal to you who you are and that what that to reveal to you that that that what God has done for you that God has taken you from a place where you were incarnality and your own messed up condition that that like we've been talking about in Sunday school that that uh you uh all that stuff that happened in the Garden of Eden to get us into the place that we were we were and we needed to be redeemed and God come down and died for us on the cross and filled us with the Holy Ghost and took us from changes from this to this to this until finally you can look look like John did and look and see a door opened in heaven one day we're going to have to come to that place where we can get out of here we you've got to come to a place where you you're you're not just guessing and probing and wondering if we're going to be able to take a body change but you know that you're gonna step out of here step out of this room so John heard a voice and it was calling him up here and he heard a voice that was clear and distinct and brother Adam said it was the same voice that spoke to her it spoke to him here on Earth what what can we get out of that it's the same voice yeah we sometimes we want to make it so complicated and things but you see it was the same voice all the time it's the same voice that called you that first little camp meeting you were in that personal situation maybe somebody was witnessing to you and you begin to hear that tongue of God on your life and it wasn't the man talking to you but it was the voice of God in your heart speaking to you and and he said same voice that's been calling you all along it's the same voice that's speaking to you here tonight that's calling you that's identifying you with the scripture because you know you've got to have you got to have an identified life you've got to have a Vindicated life that's what I'm speaking of tonight oh you you look at like you look at John what the life that that man lived that that that John John uh John typified the kind of person that's going to it's going to take to go in a Rapture John John was the eagle of the Matthew Mark Luke John he was you can see to follow that plan through the the first four the first four gospels that went from Lion ox man and eagle and and John typified the eagle who who was lifted up in his Revelation Who had who had a a greater understanding maybe than the the way that everybody else would look at it and that's the same way that a born-again believer in this age is going to have to come it's gonna you're gonna have to be lifted up not lifted up Beyond just being born again and lifted up Beyond just being going up the stature perfect man but lifted up into the promises of a Capstone Revelation where you know what God is doing where you understand these things and you see the whole time it was the same voice and brother Adam would say he was in the candy speaking from them to his church the voice the voice was the voice of Christ now now think tonight let's let's think let's meditate on these things I just want to kind of talk to you tonight to think what what is it going to take to go in the Rapture now now what what is it what kind of person is it going to take you you think tonight about all our problems and things about maybe differences between one another and problems with marital problems and just whatever whatever it might be there's always problems I I'm not I'm not trying to you know I'm tonight I'm not running after I'm not trying to attack nothing so let's just be at Liberty and I'm not coming after nothing but you know we've all got problems but you see you can't take you can't take your grudges and things with you you got to lay those weights down you got to get rid of those things you see that's the picture that John was John was love love and you got to have so much love love for one another that you don't even care if somebody smites you on your cheek you don't care what someone what you see maybe let's restate that sometimes you can here it hurts but you see Love Will project love love projects when it you it's something Supernatural taking place and you can't how are you going to go in the Rapture with grudges and anger and bitterness and bitter towards one another can't forgive one another you see love can forgive somebody when it looks like how are you going to forgive how you how can you forgive but love will come in and take over and forgive somebody when it looks like there's no way how are we going to take it go in the Rapture you can't take your carnality in the Rapture you can't take your you can't take your pride you can't take your enmity you can't take all of your bad feelings what's it going to take to go in the Rapture it's going to take Oneness Oneness with God the same word the same word that was sown in the beginning the same life the same character the same love I'm talking about the same love that could be hanging up on the cross and say father forgive them that kind of love I'm talking about the kind of love that could be there in the Garden of Gethsemane saying father not my will but thine be done oh when we want it we want to accomplish a purpose for our own selves but to lay down that that selfishness and where you just want to do something for your own prosperity to lay that down and say God whatever you want me to do that's what I want to do whatever you want me to go that's where I want to go that's what's going to take to go in the rapture foreign [Applause] why why will it take that because the Bride of the Bride that's going to go in the Rapture is going to be just like Jesus I'm talking about a life just like Jesus a character just like Jesus a life that is exactly like Jesus Oh you see when we study these things out that's on this board behind me these aren't just things to learn but these are things that must be projected in your life the character of Christ demonstrated through you the same Temperance the same ability to control your emotions to control your reaction to a situation the same patience the ability to wait on God and wait for your brother and sister that might be upset with you and might not be at the place that you think they ought to be but you wait on them because the same life that was in Christ is in you the bride is going to be just like Jesus Jesus oh you think well that's a tall order tonight but but yet God has given us the recipe and it's laying here in the pages that's why when I'm preaching tonight to you from Revelation chapter four I'm not just preaching something to learn about I'm not just preaching something that John knew that he had studied about but something that John saw my Revelation it's got to come by Revelation and you realize that your character your character is actually connected to your Revelation that's why Revelation is so important as these things are revealed to you precept upon precept word upon word line upon line it's actually changing who you are to be like Jesus oh Lord his voice his voice is actually changing your character oh you think tonight well I don't know why we need to come to church well that's why because I want my character to be changed I don't know why we need to be gathered around one together I don't know why we don't can't just sit at home because because I I want my character to be changed I I don't know about you but there's a lot of things still in my life that I find that are lacking things that I want to be able to lay down and the only way that we're going to get rid of them is not by our own efforts or by our own works but by submitting to the voice of God what voice are you talking about tonight brother Bob I'm talking about that voice that John heard the voice that's been dealing with you in your whole Christian Journey that voice that voice is changing you that voice is changing it's correcting your character it's correcting who you were and changing it to what God saw you would be before the foundation of the world brother Brown said so when you surrender your complete being oh when you surrender your complete being how many wants to do that tonight to Just Surrender everything about us my soul and my spirit and my body surrender it all so he can change it all oh there's the secret of the Rapture right there so he can change it all my body my soul and my spirit and body so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word Temperance patience godliness Broly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around there he is a candidate to go in the rapture and I was I was thinking about you know that story that of Noah and the Ark you think about how Noah built that Ark and he got brother Ram said he would get that's your team wood and then he would pitch it and the Bible talks about that he would pitch it pitch it fill it up with that that pine tar and put that in that chateem wood now you think about that now that it started out as your team would but brother Brian when he explained that he said you put that pine tar in it and it ain't your teamwood anymore it's Pine why because the spirit will change you now that's what I'm talking about here tonight that that it behooves us to look at our life and see if our life Compares with the scripture because if you have a true revelation of the word of God it's going to change your life it's unavoidable because a revelation is something that's Supernatural so if the supernatural God gives you a supernatural Revelation it's going to have a supernatural impact on your life you can't just stay here in the same condition and say well something's happening to me but I still struggle with this and struggle with that things are began going to begin to fall off but just like that team would that team would was changed when it got pitched within without and then Noah could take that and put it in the ark and it would become something it would become a part of God's plan and purpose you got to be identified your life has to be identified your life has to be Vindicated with this word and and what I'm getting here tonight is that's that picture of what John saw he saw a vision of of these things that I'm speaking of here tonight you got to be identified brother Adam said somewhere you must show your life shows tonight where you are identified oh you think about what a that's that seems almost like complicated or whatever whatever you'd say like a complex thing to think about but to think now that wherever you go that you can preach a message with your life I told Brother Wade uh on Sunday that the day before we went to I was picking my wife up at Ross and and uh you know we were just in the parking lot and this man came up to us in the parking lot after he saw my wife and my daughters walking around in their dresses and coming to the car and he started talking to me about how he was looking he saw he saw some people that were trying to live according to the scripture and he began to talk to us about how he was he he didn't he wasn't happy with where he was and he was looking for a church because there's people everywhere that are looking for something and you see you see now the example of the point I'm trying to make is that your life is a sermon and everywhere you go people can see if you believe what you say you believe because your life is on display and you actually oh you think about all these sermons that brother Brandon preached about your life did he preached the message influence that it Isaiah got to looking at the life of Josiah and and he was like and he failed his in his influence because his life didn't match up with what his testimony was and you think about the prayer the message the Paradox where brother Adam said that your life that God can change your life and that's a greater Miracle you think about all these things that God oh what a great thing it is to have a changed life that can preach a sermon up your life can preach a sermon greater than maybe any preacher the greatest sermon that any preacher could preach that when you go to Walmart and when you go to work and people see you people see you at work and you're not going out and drinking alcohol with everybody else that you're something different about you that you're you cause your life and your testimony is on display oh you see that's why when we come to church some people come to church because they're told we got to do it and some people come to church because of the good singing and some people come for a fellowship and some people just come to be a part of something but I'm coming to be changed I'm coming because I want to see more of Jesus Christ when we sing that word that song that song opened the Eyes of My Heart that's their purpose to come to church because Revelation is what is going to change us and Revelation is what's going to take us out of here Revelation is what's going to open up that door in heaven revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ to you means more than anything else the Revelation personally to you of who Jesus Christ is and it's got to be personally to you amen oh you see so many people look at the minister and they say well if I can just get the minister to Pat me on the back or give me that special word of acknowledgment but you see that's not what it is it's got the minister is to it's the minute what is what is the preaching of the Gospel to set an atmosphere in the church so that you begin to you begin to God can begin to draw you and you can begin to have a relationship with God not with the minister but between you and God now brother Brian said the same voice that said to John come up is the same voice that'll summons the church someday the same voice that said to John come up is the same voice that'll summons the church someday how are we going to take a rapture brother brother Bob I'm we're just gonna we're just gonna want to real bad oh we're just gonna wait till the date on the calendar shows up no it'll be a revelation that'll take you in the rapture same voice that John summoned John to come up that was written in first Thessalonians the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the Trump of God and John said he that voice sounded like a trump that voice that's that it's that same voice that was in the prophet's message same voice that's speaking through the bride to get them ready the same voice the voice and it's still going to be the same voice that calls you up to reveal himself to you then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and brother Bram said it's the same thing tonight when a clear sounding voice says sin and repent I'll give you eternal life oh think about that and now he's bringing it down here to right here in this congregation sitting here tonight on a Wednesday night and we're tired and the week has been hard but it's the same voice tonight when a clear sounding voice says repent and I'll give you eternal life repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ brother Brown said and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the summons nothing uncertain about it what is it that voice that voice is calling us it's calling us higher now you remember we we all want to go higher and you sometimes we try to work things up and try to we try to go higher by pushing other people down try to go higher by elevating ourselves but remember and God the way up to go up now this it is so perplexing that the way up is not to not to put yourself up not to try to get yourself into a position but the way up is to always go down to where that to go down and Jesus typified that example throughout his life even to the place where you know they're sitting there eating eating the last supper and Jesus gets out the water and it gets down and starts washing his disciples feet because you got to go down so far until you're washing off that dirty manure from the street you're helping your brother helping your brother out in whatever way you can now there's true love to get down and then brother Brown even said he said you got to come to dust you got to get to a place that you know that you're nothing and don't never arise above it for as soon as you rise above it you ride eyes above God as soon as you arrived above dust what does that mean I I want something practical I can take home with me bro brother Bob when when a minister goes to another church and he comes in there with his chest pumped out and he's like if they don't ask me to preach then bless God they they don't like this and they don't like that oh you see we go in like dust duh when you rise above dust then you rise above God bless God so and so won't talk to me they can't talk to me that way but Jesus let them talk to him that way Jesus they're hanging on the cross and they were smiling him on the face and and spitting on him and everything and and he just let them I hope why can't we just let people talk to us he just let him if we're gonna be like Jesus but you see you can't just be like Jesus because you want to real bad it takes the word of God in your life you've got to be receptive to the word you've got to allow because what is the word doing that voice as it's spoken over your life is actually claiming your life and claiming you and changing your life is actually claiming your life and claiming you and changing you so you're like him so you walk like him and talk like him and act like him because his life is in you until the bride is him she is him because his life and his characteristics are all manifested in her and that's what John was representing John represented you John was love John come to a place there on that island where God come down and showed him the whole plan took him up and showed him the door opened in heaven showed him the The Throne of God with the Brazen altar in front of it and the 24 elders and the cherubims and this whole scene that was opening up at an emerald rainbow around about The Throne all these things and you see that was representing that was typing you sitting here tonight that was typing you that John John was love and you're going to have you're going to have Capstone love to get out of here enough love to turn the other cheek love enough to not rile back love enough not to roll back even when you've got a right Love Enough to think that you're nothing in First Corinthians Paul said If any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet is he ought to know but if any man what love God love God the same is known of him I I want people to know that I love God you know when you get in your mind sometimes that how much you know then before you know it you'll turn a corner and you'll find out how much you didn't know that's why Paul was saying that if any man think that he knoweth anything soon as you think you oh you think now I've got it down I understand that being born again I I now I can I can really preach and then you turn a corner and you find out that you got to add to your faith virtue and now you've got all that figured out oh you got it figured out and and there's always more around the corner and you think that you know it all and then you just turn around the corner and there's somebody else that maybe knows a little bit more about this particular thing than you do that's why we always need to don't never rise above the Dust and even Jesus God God made himself oh you think about that Jesus come down and made himself of no reputation in Philippians chapter 3 he said uh he said let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mine Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others unless this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a serpent it was made in the likeness of man now what does that mean to take on no reputation the man that made brother Brown said the man that made a false leg got a reputation for doing it oh you think about that now but the man that made a real leg when he was here didn't get no reputation the man that made the real teeth he didn't get it it didn't take his self no reputation but the man that made false teeth got a reputation the man that made an artificial eye made himself a name by doing it but the man that made the real eye took all himself no reputation but he was Emmanuel now if if God himself manifested in flesh could array himself like that the god that made a leg and an eye and an arm and all those things could take himself take no reputation then what about you and I it's gonna the Revelation a revelation is going to take us out of here is going to come to a bunch of nobodies I think that's the point that I'm trying to make somebody that's willing to just allow themselves to be run over somebody is willing to allow themselves to be used and abused brother said look at who John the Baptist was some kind of odd little fella a Woodsman out in the woods a nobody but it was revealed to him look at the little Virgin Mary look at everybody in the Bible who amounted to nothing a man Elijah to come out of the Wilderness nobody knew nothing about him a little nobody and he said rain ain't going to fall till I could call the rain won't fall until I call for it look at look at Moses who he thought he tried to be somebody but then he God took him out on the desert so he could prove to him what he really was that he wasn't nobody he wasn't a nobody and he needed God to move on the scene for him look at Abraham who a man out in the Fertile Crescent and God just turned him around one day and said get out here get out here in this Promised Land a man that God God showed him who he really was they heard the call and it was revealed to him revealed to a bunch of nobodies a little nobody on the Isle of Patmos that they got so frustrated with that they couldn't Bowl him and all that they said well I don't know what to do with him so we'll just put you out here brother said he was alone alone on the Isle of patma a nobody a nobody that gets to a place where they're no they're down in the dust that's the kind of person that God can work with I want to say this tonight that it's the kind of person that God can work with it's like brother Brown said to make little man with his lunch box going to work you don't have to work nothing up and try to be something special the little sister hanging her clothes out to dry on a clothesline and you see these aren't just stories to see like just rhetoric to try to get everybody worked up and cry a little bit but it's real it's real this is something real that the Revelation to get out of here is going to be revealed to Humble Little People humble people like Hattie Wright that didn't have no money and she was sitting up there and the tractor had fallen on her husband but yet God came by and paid her a visit that's the kind of people aren't you glad that that's the kind of people that the word is revealed to a little humble group of people not something special in the way that the world calls special but God has made you a special group of people a special class of people why because you were willing to humble yourself to the word of God and submit yourself to his authority and do like do like Ruth and lay at the feet of your Redeemer and say cover me over I'm not worth nothing without you but if you'll cover me over I know that you'll accomplish the purpose John heard a voice calling him up come up hither and that voice is yet calling today you know in John chapter 10 Jesus said to him the porter openness and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own Sheep by name and leadeth him out and when he puteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice oh I I I I I feel like I I just can't reiterating that I'm enough a born-again Believer ever ever believer should know should be able to recognize the voice of God when you hear when you hear a good sermon preached over the pulpit you should something something begins to stir I recognize that voice that's that's my God calling me when you're talking to a believer in the parking lot something will begin to stir up within you is faith building up to know that that's that's my God talking to me that's the voice that I've heard since the very beginning you know a man can't call you a man can't draw you a man can't give you this invitation brother Brandon would say but that's why we can't force you to believe but what I can do I can't force you to be a Christian I can't force you to come to church I can't force you to come to the Bible say dirty I can't force you to gather around but what I can do I can speak a word of encouragement to you I can speak what's written here in the Bible and set an atmosphere in the church and create an environment where you can respond to God and what God God can do what no man could ever do you see Jesus said no man could come to me except the Father which I sent me drawing and I'll raise him up at the last that no man can come to me except the father drawn but when God calls you oh if God is calling at your heart tonight don't don't put don't let another day go by until you respond that is the greatest gift on the face of the earth when God draws a man when God speaks to your heart and begins to begins to reveal himself to you begins to what you to say I I want to speak to your heart now oh to think now that your life now see you've got to have a Vindicated life that your life can create an atmosphere that your words can create an atmosphere that your words and your life can create an atmosphere where somebody wants to be a Christian create an atmosphere where somebody wants to give their heart to the Lord that's the kind of Christian I want to be there I want to stir you up tonight to want to be that kind of Christian every born-again believer has the power to create an atmosphere that around you everywhere you go because a born-again Believer is a Creator you have the ability to create an atmosphere what kind of an atmosphere an atmosphere where other people want to be like Jesus let's I I want to encourage you tonight to let's let's stir ourselves up to examine ourselves and look at our life and say am I that kind of a person because what I'm talking about tonight is you've got to be that kind of a person if you want to step over without dying step over into eternity and take a Rapture to go straight through that door that John said because why why brother Bob because to be that kind of a Believer to be that kind of person to go to the Rapture without taste and death you've got to be like Jesus you got to be just like Jesus my brother Adam said do you now and do you now believe he said now let me tell you something each man that's born again with the spirit of God in him is a miniature creator now that might shake you a little but that's the truth we're in the image of God God is a Creator that's the reason that you can believe that God could heal a person because God is in you and God made this world he just spoke it and his word become material the very ground that you're sitting on is the word of God made manifest if he didn't where where did he get it well see he just spoke it and it turned into existence he believed in his own word and if a man's born to the spirit of God he's an offspring of God and that part of God is in him and he believes every word that God says will materialize see so that makes him part of God the Holy Spirit and the man makes him a part of God and now now here's the the Clincher did you ever see people nice people but you just couldn't hardly stand to be around sure you have you don't have nothing against them but you can't stand to be around them usually the reason you can't stand to read around somebody is because they're pulling you down and they're saying you I don't want to hear negative stuff all the time and they're they're trying to lift themselves up by saying something hurtful poking and prodding and always picking and wonderful people surely but you don't want to be around them and then then brother Brown will say then you've seen some person that saw maybe a little old scrawny fella that's what I'm talking about or a little old woman bent over a wash tub but you just love to be around that person you just love them somehow what what are you talking about brother bro I'm talking about little nobodies somebody bent over a wash tub it's the atmosphere that they've got around it the way they live they create an atmosphere that you like to be into that's lovely people to be with I ought to think that the words that you say can create an atmosphere that your life creates an atmosphere that preaching creates an atmosphere oh surely you can recognize here that sitting in this in this place that there's a different atmosphere that there is outside in the world there's an atmosphere when you sit under the the the the anointing of the preaching of the Gospel that begins to cause you to think that all things are possible well maybe when you were driving in on the way to church tonight you were thinking that you've been having a rough week and then you come into church and you begin to think you start thinking about where you are in your life and that you've heard that voice all this time that same voice has been calling you and it begins to anoint your faith begins to lift you up why because God wants you to come up higher he's calling you higher he's calling you higher just like he called John up it's the preaching the words the life the life of the Gospel that you see on display here at the church sets an atmosphere in your it sets to the atmosphere in the building an atmosphere to draw you up higher that's what the preaching of the Gospel is for to create an atmosphere to draw you up higher to draw you a pyre which is why you'll never go higher than what is preached it's got to be high to draw you up it's got to be deep to draw you up why because because we're not here just to be born again we're not here just to sit around at the bottom but we've been called to be like John to be an eagle to fly up into the heavenlies so the preaching of the Gospel in this day has got to be high that there's so many different Avenues I could go down it's like all of a sudden I'm thinking of different things that could be said but I gotta said he's the one that showed John the mystery of them seven golden candlesticks holding the Seven Stars the white wigs feet like brass eyes like fire all the symbols he's the one that gave the gospel he's the one that gave the message he's the one that has been speaking through the seven churches he's the one that spoke through the seven certain Messengers is his voice and it's the same one we say that's been speaking to you the whole time of your Christian Journey what are you talking about brother Bob I'm talking about that one day you knew that it was time to turn around damn it just like Abraham one day you knew that the message was true not because somebody told you but because you heard the voice of God one day you will know that it's time to go up not because somebody preached a real good sermon that kind of got everybody you know thinking along a good theological line but one day you'll know that it's time to go up because you'll hear the voice of God what is it the voice of Revelation a revelation that your Redemption is complete so in Revelation chapter 4 verse two to three it says immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one said on the throne and he that set was to look upon like a Jasper and a sword and stone there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald now brother Ryan will say every word's got a meaning ever he he said every person every person in this building tonight based depending on what month you were born in has a birthstone and every time that a patriarch was born they had a birthstone now now you think about that I think let's let's really meditate on this tonight that the first of those birthstones was Reuben and the last of those birthstones was Benjamin in other words he's speaking that God is the first and the last first and last of what that he started this church ages he's finished him he started your Revelation and he's going to finish it he's going to bring you to an end he started the whole thing and he's going to finish it he said the first was Reuben the last was Benjamin the birthstone of Reuben was Jasper the birthstone of Benjamin was Sergeant he was to look upon as Reuben and Benjamin the first and the last he that was which is and shall come he was Alpha and the Greek alphabet Omega and the Greek alphabet he was the first the last he was from Benjamin to Reuben from Reuben to Benjamin what is it speaking of that he's the author of your faith and he's your finisher he's it's the same voice the whole time and the one that started the work in you is able to finish it he's the one from Reuben to Benjamin Jasper to Sardis what is it it's a journey it's a process that God has been dealing with you as he takes you on a attorney just like he took Abraham on and Ruth on and estheron at every all these stories in the Bible David and Abraham and everyone at Moses every one of them you can go back to and see that they started off somewhere and God took them to a place of of completion in their life there's a start of something and there's an end of something brother Brown said he was the beginning of time he's the ending of time he was the first of the Patriarchs he's the last of the Patriarchs he was the spirit that was in the Church of Ephesus he was the spirit in the Church of laodicea he is the first and the last A to Z first last he that was and shall come rude and offspring of David the Morning Star the lily of the valley the rose and shared he's the first and the last now that's why that's why when you get up when you begin as the seals begin to open up the seventh seal is what the end the end of all things so as the seals begin to open up what's the seals reveal and they'll see a seals of revealing a journey and the seventh seal is the end that's why brother Brian would say it's the seventh seal is the end it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of the church age it's the end of the Seven Seals it's the end of the trumpets it's the the end of the vows and even ends the ushering end of the Millennium and that's what we're looking at here when we look at these two stones The Jasper and The Sword and the stone it's talking about a journey now brother would say you take you take these birthstones as a mother as the mothers cried out that they were actually speaking where these children of Israel be placed in the Homeland and you take those stones that typified each of those children the children of Israel and you and you put them put them in that urum let's think about this now because what what are we talking about tonight I'm talking about that your life has to be Vindicated your life has to be proven scripturally that matches up with the Bible that's the kind of person that's going to take a body change that's why you know as we're studying these things out these sermons that that brother Brown preached these little stories that are just kind of woven in here are for a purpose to build up our faith to give us a revelation of something that maybe was previously hidden so brother Brown he would say now I'm just going to this is kind of a long reading but now now think about taking those stones and putting them into the breastplate of the high priest and when a prophet comes and speaks before those stones that are in that breastplate a light is going to shine to show whether or not the prophet's word is true and he said well then mothers he said let me show you a Divine word friend so that your faith will be built certain in the word of God every time them Hebrew mothers when they were in labor given labor pains to be born these children the very words that she uttered in her birth give the man the baby that was born of her his name and positionally placed him in Palestine where he'll be at the coming of the Lord the labor pains in this mother like Ephraim means by the Sea and Ephraim was given his lot by the sea and say Judah meant I don't know what the word means but I could pick it out now see that's where I don't have time these short things to pick those things up but then go back and Judah whatever Judah means men in his position placed among the children of Israel each one of those children when they were born they had a birthstone and when Aaron the high priest over each one of those children had a breastplate on him his dress that's what I want to hold off just a little longer to get into this sixth verse because that brings in every symbol of the Old Testament right into there all the furniture and everything in the Old Testament was a pattern of that was seen in heaven patterned back to the human being and here's Aaron's breastplate he was a high priest notice the birthstone of each tribe was represented in there one a birthstone put his stone in there the tribe of Ephraim the tribe of Manasseh the tribe of GAD The Tribe of Benjamin all was represented in in here and that's taught everybody was represented in that breastplate everybody from their birth representing their birth was put in that breastplate then they take those birthstones and pretty gems and hang it on the post like this and if a prophet prophesied and it's a sound right or not they taken him down to this urum thumb and let him tell his prophecy if there's a sacred light come on there and begin to flash these Stones together it was God speaking back it was for the whole tribe all of them every tribe now I I want to maybe just cause you to think for a moment if you could take a Lively Stone and put them where they're supposed to be and then let a prophet speak in front of him the light would flash back to vindicate that that prophet's message was true then that would mean if you were Lively stones and that would mean that you actually are the proof that the prophet's message is true when the prophet speaks over your life and the light of the Gospel the light of what that same light that was in that Pillar of Fire over him is anointing the church today and I'm proven that's what brother Randall was bringing out when he preached to Revelation chapter 4 part 2 that that same Pillar of Fire is now in you the same Pillar of Fire that most churches have hanging on the wall in their congregation so it can be referred to that same Pillar of Fire is in you in your life and when the prophet speaks the light flashes across your life to show that his word was true that means your life is the very Vindication that this word is true the word of God has positionally placed you in your inheritance and you are the proof is true because the word of God has claimed your life when the prophet prophesied the light is shown in your life to prove that it was correct oh you see what is the proof what is the proof of the pudding what is the proof of what tree it is what is the proof the proof is in the life when the life comes up out of that tree and begins to Bear forth fruit you can look and say there's an orange hanging off that tree and I know that that's an orange tree because I can see the life that's what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7 he said every tree that breakth forth not good fruit is hewned down and cast Into the Fire wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them how are you going to know them how are you going to know a real G I'm talking about this kind of a real genuine Christian by their fruits and what did Brothers say your fruit was your Doctrine and your Doctrine planted in the sea of a of a heart that's willing to receive it well it'll Bubble Up and produce the thing that was planted in the heart of your ground the same thing that was planted is what'll produce what are you produce and you're producing the word that you've held because the word is what will change your character and the character that's on display is what was sown in your heart hey hey I don't know how that doesn't stir anybody up and a paradox brother Ryan said you thinking you have and having it it's two different things you might be able to try to say you have and you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it he said no matter how many emotions how much you jump run Sensations speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you might lay it upon which is all right I believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is now now the fruit the fruit of this kind of Christian somebody that's yielded themselves to the place where they come up to love and acting just like Jesus what's going to be on display the fruits of the spirit they're going to love they're going to have joy and speakable they're going to have all these fruits on display able to bear with one another that's the kind of Christian that I think John was was that this story is speaking of here in Revelation chapter four somebody that comes to a place comes to a place where you can take a body change you're going to be just like Jesus you got to have the life on display you got to have the token life on display the token is the blood and what's in the blood is the life that's why it says there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an eminent oh you think about this picture that John saw there was a rainbow round about The Throne complete not like a half rainbow but all the way around and it wasn't like a seven colored rainbow it was one color and he said it was like an emerald in other words it was green a green rainbow a greenish he said this greenish what does green represent life green is the Evergreen always stays green is life why because this kind of a Christian is going to be a fountain of everlasting life this kind of a Christian is going to have an Artesian well bubbling up within them some this kind of Christian is going to take a body change you're going to be able to see that life on this place so much that it they'll they'll create an atmosphere everywhere they go you'll be able to look at them and say that person right there has got all these virtues in them this person has got patience and Temperance and they know what they're talking about when I talk to them and they're encouraging when I when I sit around with them they're not pushing me down and trying to build themselves up by pushing me down and picking on everybody else and fighting a weak spot like a chicken in the barnyard does and poking at it but they're trying to build up one another Like an Eagle because that's what an eagle does an eagle will find another eagle with crushed on their eyes and then try to build them up and encourage them that's the kind of love that's got to be on display oh the picture of that life a picture of that life is a Vindication of this message that's the proof that this message is true and brother Brown said now that you might not you might know that the color of the light that's where the Laurel and the Lord's light that follows the Lord and it's as the Lord is Amber yellowish green that's the same color of the light that's with us today as the scientist has took its picture yellowish green Amber oh see we we always for years people they look at that picture on their wall and they say that was back there with brother Branham he had this special anointing and all these which which of course we know that he did but the point that I'm trying to make is that same God that was with him typified shown visibly in that with that same with that light that same God is here with you tonight it's here with us creating this atmosphere in this building right now surely surely you can recognize that God is with us here surely you can recognize surely if you're sensitive to the movement of the Holy Spirit you can recognize his presence in that place at this place why because we know that same Pillar of Fire is with us now he said I want you to remember that God still exists in the same colors from the loins upward fire Amber Kohler shot with a movie camera or with a color camera Amber from the loins up from the loins down and all around many colors like us in the rainbow in the sky after a rain Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Holy Spirit still in his power still in his church in this last day oh oh can't you see that tonight church that he's still in the same power because he's still the same yesterday today and forever somebody asked brother Brown and one of the questions that answers sermons in 1964 he said uh he said I guess he said what was the other question I get so wound up when these forget what these things were one of them was was I the son of man and here it is I believe the son of man or was the pillar of fire the son of man he said no the pillar of fire is the anointing amen he said now that Pillar of Fire is the logos that went out of God the logos which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God when God becoming to a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the great spirit that went forth It's condescending coming down it's coming down coming down to where to rest in you in your heart that's the picture that John saw is that God is dwelling in you that that right that Emerald rainbow all around that Throne is showing that God that life is in you he said and who do you say this is he said Lord we know it's you it's Jesus Christ and the person of the Holy Ghost he is the Holy Ghost I come from God I go to God and we see the great Pillar of Fire Among Us Lord the same as they did in the first part of the Bible with Moses we've seen it in the middle of the Bible when Paul was on his road to Damascus we see it now here we see it at the end time again it's the same Lord Jesus made flesh and his people anointing his word for the bride oh to think about that same life that was with brother Branham was with you now that's something to meditate on when you lay behind beside your bed tonight and you say your evening prayers that's something to meditate on when you open up your Bible tomorrow morning and you begin to pour through the scriptures to think that that same Pillar of Fire is with you and that same Pillar of Fire is changing you what is it life in you brother Bob said in the message of Grace he said now Jesus Christ dwells in the people one day Christ was in a pillar of fire that one you see taken and we believe it to be Jehovah God that's what the angel was trying to get to us now he was in the fatherhood then he was the father of Israel and Nation then he came and dwelt among his people as Christ the son is that right Christ was the son of God now he's Christ the Holy Spirit which is the anointing Christ means the anointed and the anointed one upon the people Christ with us the holy spirit is Christ with us in us and he asked that question you believe that if that Holy same Holy Ghost is with us that means that that same life is in you that that same life is in the church and the whole Christian story is about life from the time that Abel offered that sacrifice because he knew it was life he knew it was blood to the time that Christ offered his sacrifice for us so that his life could be put in us to now where that same life is in you and the fullness the fullness of the God had bodily back in his bride again revealing Christ in his fullness that God would be manifested with the same character the same attributes the same response to the world and you know that life will be an attraction the life is an attraction what is the life the life becomes a voice that is thundering out the life becomes the greatest testimony that's ever been lived the greatest testimony is a life that is lived by the word what kind of life you talking about I'm talking about that life like brother Chris long was preaching about that where you become a burning bush where when people when people see the life that you live they want to turn aside to ask you some questions about what you believe oh that's that's that's what we all got to attain to we've all got to put Christ on display we're we're demonstrating the same love and the same joy and the same peace and long-suffering now there's how you get the Saints to come to church there's how you get people to come to Fellowship is let there be an attraction there's how you get people together around there's an attraction there's an attraction that'll draw the predecinated and then you see you see there's a there was an attraction there's a third pool attraction to draw those rainbow trout fish you can't oh well you fisherman you know that when you go fishing you can't get you can't like Rush a bunch of fish to get up in your boat you gotta catch them you got to put some bait on the hook and the bait on the hook is the life they'll see your life and they'll want to know more and they bite the hook and the hook is the word and the word grabs them so let them see your life because your life is the greatest sermon that could ever be preached oh how many wants your life your your actions and your words to be that kind of Attraction tonight I'm going to stop on that note tonight that's I've got so many I got probably another I don't know how many pages but we could go on and on tonight but let's the musicians go ahead and come up but let's you see this still alive and it's it can't be forced You Don't Force It Don't force it don't work it
