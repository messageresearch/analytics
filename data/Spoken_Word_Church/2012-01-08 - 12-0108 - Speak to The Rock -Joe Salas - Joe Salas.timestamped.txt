[0:01] my turn
[0:03] today myself it is uh speak to the Rock
[0:06] and I'm going to use two scriptures I've
[0:08] got more scriptures but these are the
[0:10] ones that we're going to read out the
[0:11] Bible
[0:16] when when God said Moses to take his
[0:19] people out of Egypt uh two and a half
[0:21] million people on it too made it to the
[0:23] promised land
[0:24] because of their unbelieved Joshua and
[0:27] Caleb
[0:29] now here's what he's gonna hurt the
[0:30] other day so brother Brown said Egypt is
[0:33] a type of the world
[0:35] they said we can't leave this message
[0:38] they said at least in Egypt we had here
[0:42] goes makeup pants scissors they also
[0:46] have
[0:47] football it's all right throw that one
[0:49] in there
[0:53] you see they weren't ready for the
[0:55] journey
[0:56] so are we ready for the tournament
[1:00] let's read our scriptures numbers 20 1
[1:04] to 12 1-12
[1:07] foreign
[1:22] into the deserts of Zion in the first
[1:26] month and the people of voted and Miriam
[1:30] died there and was buried there
[1:33] and there was no water for the
[1:35] congregation and they gathered
[1:36] themselves together against Moses and
[1:39] against Aaron
[1:41] people
[1:42] both osmosis and speak and saying would
[1:46] God
[1:47] that we had died when our brother died
[1:49] before the Lord why have you brought up
[1:52] the congregation of the Lord and to the
[1:54] Wilderness that we
[1:56] and our cattle should die there
[1:59] and wherefore have you made us to come
[2:01] out of Egypt
[2:03] to bring us into this evil place it is
[2:06] no place a seed or a figs or a vines or
[2:09] pomegranates either is there any water
[2:12] to drink
[2:14] and Moses and Aaron went from the
[2:16] presence of the assembly unto the door
[2:19] of the Tabernacle of the congregation
[2:21] and they fell upon their faces in the
[2:24] glory of the Lord appeared unto them
[2:28] and the Lord respect unto Moses and says
[2:31] saying this is what God told Moses to do
[2:35] take the rod and gather the assembly
[2:38] together
[2:40] in Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto
[2:43] the rock speak ye unto the Rock
[2:46] before their eyes and it shall give
[2:49] forth his water and thou shalt bring
[2:51] forth
[2:53] to them water out of the rocks of that
[2:56] shall give the congregation in their
[2:58] BEAST's dream
[3:01] and Moses took the rod from him before
[3:03] the Lord as he commanded and Moses and
[3:06] Aaron gather
[3:07] the congregation together for the Rock
[3:10] and he said
[3:12] he said unto them hear me hear now he
[3:16] Rebels must we fetch you we're out of
[3:18] water of this rock
[3:21] and Moses lifted up his hand and with
[3:23] his rod
[3:24] he smoked the rock twice
[3:27] that's what it did twice
[3:31] and the water came out of that
[3:33] abundantly and the congregation drank
[3:36] and their Beast also
[3:39] and there are spec onto Moses and Air
[3:42] because you believe me not to sanctify
[3:46] me in the eyes of the children of Israel
[3:48] therefore
[3:49] you should not bring this congregation
[3:52] into the land which I have given them
[4:00] now what did Moses do he uh
[4:04] he traded that promised land for a
[4:07] moment of anger
[4:11] in the bottom of the numbers 20
[4:15] Scorpio says
[4:17] The Rock Christ as First Corinthians 4
[4:20] Once meeting knits needs not to be it's
[4:24] made in crucified again
[4:28] but an end time will prior crucified by
[4:31] rejecting his word but it cannot be
[4:34] crucified once
[4:36] said Moses acted exalted himself and
[4:39] imply entitled The One sacrifice wasn't
[4:43] in in future
[4:46] does deny the eternally
[4:49] I think shave I don't know other blood
[4:53] the Abundant water Grace reaching the
[4:55] meet other people despite the error of
[4:58] the leader tells
[5:00] a refreshing and power through the
[5:02] spirit
[5:04] okay let's go to uh part of the
[5:06] scripture
[5:10] First Corinthians
[5:11] 10 1-4
[5:14] he said moreover brother
[5:17] I would not let you be ignorant that all
[5:21] our fathers were under the cloud and all
[5:22] passed through the sea and Aaron we're
[5:25] all baptizing to Moses and the cloud and
[5:28] in the sea and they all eat the same
[5:31] spiritual meat and did our drinkers same
[5:34] spiritual drink before they drink of
[5:36] that spiritual rock that follow them and
[5:39] that rock was Christ
[5:43] by many of them God was not well pleased
[5:47] for they were overthrown in the
[5:49] wilderness
[5:54] thank you
[5:59] in the message speak to the July 23 23rd
[6:04] 1960 brother mom said
[6:07] he said it must have been a hard morning
[6:10] everybody was all confused and
[6:13] frustrated because I said all night long
[6:16] the cattle had
[6:21] behold and the children cried and the
[6:24] people had fussed and argue and quarrel
[6:28] he said poor Moses it was a dreadful
[6:30] time for him you see he had come down
[6:32] into Egypt and had brought the children
[6:35] according to the purpose of God
[6:38] and was leading them to the promised
[6:39] land
[6:40] said Atlanta along with milk and honey
[6:42] was a promise of God to protect them and
[6:45] to supply everything they had need of
[6:47] until they reached this glorious land
[6:51] flowing with milk and honey
[6:53] said Moses and God called servant or
[6:56] named Prophet Pillar of Fire over him
[6:59] follow him confirming the words that he
[7:02] spoke the signs
[7:04] and wandered on his road to the promised
[7:06] land with the children
[7:08] a very definite type rather of a journey
[7:12] today
[7:12] we're on a road to the promised land and
[7:15] we are being led by the great Holy
[7:17] Spirit as it was led and natural we are
[7:20] LED in the spiritual
[7:22] to this great promised land that God
[7:24] made the promise
[7:27] and gave to us God had promised there
[7:29] God had promised them to supply all
[7:33] their needs that their final Minds had
[7:36] taken them out of the
[7:38] Divine will of God and gave them a
[7:40] desert route
[7:42] same message
[7:46] you say about what carnal laws began to
[7:48] come along them it finally drove them
[7:50] off the main path into the desert
[7:53] said they made their fatal mistake when
[7:55] they failed to go on
[7:57] they were on the journey not very much
[7:59] many miles they could have made it in a
[8:02] few days
[8:03] that all that is two million people out
[8:06] into the desert if they stayed on the
[8:08] path
[8:12] but when they came to a place called
[8:14] queries
[8:16] at one time I was called a great
[8:18] judgment seat it was a great spring or
[8:21] well there were many little whales he
[8:24] said a perfect type of the church
[8:27] and the church is the Judgment seat
[8:30] where Heaven is a great Judgment of sea
[8:33] of God and the little Wells represent
[8:36] the little churches all
[8:38] oh a judgment begins at the house of God
[8:42] how many how many times did President
[8:44] talks about that
[8:53] he said now they make their fatal
[8:55] mistake when they began to murmur
[8:56] against Moses and against God's servants
[8:58] and against God and it bypassed them and
[9:02] remember every one of them that murmur
[9:05] never went over into the land
[9:08] he said Jesus said when he was on Earth
[9:10] your father's deity man I am the
[9:12] Wilderness but there are everyone dead
[9:20] here's what they've done they left the
[9:22] garlic pots in Egypt to eat Angels food
[9:24] and was complaining
[9:26] you could think of it you see you see
[9:28] then also they had left the Muddy Waters
[9:31] of Egypt to drink from that spiritual
[9:33] Rock so still complaining about it
[9:36] they had left the boasting Physicians of
[9:39] Egypt that boosted how great they were
[9:41] to be with a great precision
[9:43] that there wasn't even their clothes
[9:46] they didn't
[9:48] there wasn't a few one among them
[9:51] they they come from the Wilderness still
[9:54] complaining
[10:00] this ain't out of the message I just got
[10:01] this from Summer
[10:03] he says that don't complain about torns
[10:05] Among Roses but be grateful for Roses
[10:08] among the poem
[10:18] he said now we find that they
[10:21] they seen those Miracles look what was
[10:23] with them they had a smitten rock with
[10:26] them they could drink from it they had a
[10:27] breast serpent with them for healing oh
[10:30] my they had a prophet with them that had
[10:33] the word of God over the prophet was a
[10:36] pillar of fire it was due doing the
[10:38] leading and not one time
[10:41] had it ever failed them
[10:45] it hadn't failed God doesn't fail he
[10:47] cannot fall fail and remain God he's
[10:49] still God the smitten Rob the breast
[10:52] serpent the prophet and atonement is
[10:55] sacrifice everything Grace had provided
[10:58] for them already
[11:01] and afterward afterwards God had done
[11:04] all these things they were like a lot of
[11:06] people today there has to be babied
[11:08] around
[11:09] god um God doesn't want babies God wants
[11:13] man and women
[11:24] out of the message that ever pressed
[11:26] some water from the Rock brother but I
[11:28] said it was July 23 1961
[11:37] . he said in this Exodus they were given
[11:40] a spiritual leader which was Moses a
[11:42] great unknown that Prophet that was a
[11:44] great man he was a godly man he was
[11:47] warning godly man God called him from
[11:50] his mother even before that time
[11:52] God ordained him before the foundation
[11:54] of the world to be the leader to that
[11:57] generation to bring this Exodus to the
[11:59] people
[12:04] now when they were down in Egypt and God
[12:06] sent Moses he stretched forth the rod
[12:08] and fleas and lies came on the ground he
[12:12] stretched forth towards the Sun and then
[12:15] it went down he stressed it over the
[12:17] waters and it turned to blood
[12:20] he said what
[12:22] Israel was over in Canaan over in Goshen
[12:25] just having a glorious time he said the
[12:27] Sun never went down the place never
[12:30] struck them well they were just having a
[12:32] glorious time
[12:39] said and that's the way Israel was
[12:41] supposed to be but it became
[12:45] bored some he said all this old light
[12:48] bread and Angels bread well what what do
[12:51] we care about this old library
[12:55] and everything is wrong and it's all
[12:59] manner that falls out of every night
[13:01] why we would rather have some garlic and
[13:04] leeks on Egypt you see their hearts
[13:07] wasn't ready for their Journey
[13:10] I never knew what leaks were too sort of
[13:12] the Cooking Channel the other day looks
[13:15] like a onion or something
[13:18] it's all right
[13:22] uh
[13:24] you said it
[13:26] now we find out that I'm on this road
[13:28] after they got like that this they came
[13:30] to a place
[13:33] uh parrot hair then we find out he said
[13:38] let's break it down then the name down
[13:40] that's where the
[13:42] name Hera means a dry place or a desert
[13:48] he said in order to get these people to
[13:51] some water after they got over there
[13:53] this dry place was made at Calvary
[14:00] and there God told Moses he said take
[14:02] the rod and the elders and go forth and
[14:05] I will stand under on that rock before
[14:06] you
[14:07] and this rock was Christ
[14:09] and Moses with a rod that he had brought
[14:12] judgment upon the nation of Israel took
[14:15] the same rod and spoke the judgments of
[14:19] God upon the rock
[14:21] he said see he took the sins of the
[14:23] people into this wrath which he should
[14:25] have spoke with the people instead of
[14:28] smiling them the people who smoked The
[14:30] Rock
[14:31] and they rocked through the work of God
[14:33] brought salvation brought water to
[14:36] perishing people he brought life to a
[14:38] dying people
[14:40] and that's what God did by taking his
[14:43] one of judgment right and one thing
[14:46] my sins and your sins around this world
[14:50] when he should have struck us but he
[14:52] struck Christ
[14:54] that from him come forth Waters which
[14:56] means Spirit the Holy Spirit came from
[14:59] him to give us life now we have eternal
[15:02] life now that rock was Christ
[15:09] he said uh some people
[15:12] has it upon their
[15:16] their hearts and mind that all Israel
[15:18] drank and then they packed up and the
[15:20] camel's name
[15:21] their
[15:23] pictures on their horses and so forth
[15:25] and took their kids and journey on into
[15:27] somewhere else and left the rock they're
[15:30] sprinkling
[15:31] he said that's wrong that rock followed
[15:34] them and that waterfall of them didn't
[15:37] say what we saw in First Corinthians 10.
[15:39] I believe that 11 verse he can find it
[15:42] that Brock would follow Israel wherever
[15:45] they went from that day and Sport The
[15:48] Rock went with him and the waters
[15:49] followed him
[15:54] see that rock follow Israel they never
[15:56] followed Iraq but the rock followed them
[15:58] Israel went on their Journey they had
[16:01] put they had by one thing to do let's
[16:03] keep this straight course right straight
[16:06] on to the promised land
[16:08] and that rock
[16:10] and the water follow them
[16:14] he said God took the judgments of the
[16:16] people and placed them upon Christ and
[16:19] smoking
[16:22] did you notice there was a clap in the
[16:26] Rock from then on the Rock had a clap in
[16:28] it where Moses smokes and Christ had a
[16:32] cleft
[16:35] he was smitten he was wounded for a
[16:37] transgression and with his stripe we
[16:40] were healed
[16:41] from their life
[16:43] come forth that it Waters our life that
[16:46] we so enjoyed
[16:50] he said the Bible says that Waters
[16:52] follow the children of Israel when they
[16:54] got thirsty they knew the water was near
[17:13] I'm going back to the speaking to the
[17:15] Rock
[17:17] he said if you need nice big to the Rock
[17:19] if you need Joy speak to the Rock if you
[17:22] need healing speak to the Rock if you
[17:24] need the Holy Ghost speak to the Lord he
[17:26] said whatever you need
[17:28] to the Rock he'll bring forth his water
[17:31] if you believe that
[17:32] he said what the church needs today is
[17:36] get back on a speaking term with Iraq
[17:38] the Rock of Ages Christ Jesus God's men
[17:41] wrath that's God's Rock he said it's
[17:45] salvation of God they're still our
[17:47] commandment
[17:49] today
[17:50] is the name of the Rock and God will
[17:52] bring forth this
[17:54] his water out of the Rock
[18:09] in New Mexico uh
[18:11] I don't want to say where but where to
[18:13] make them bombs
[18:15] I don't want to say uh
[18:18] I find out that that they had a treaty
[18:21] with like Russia and China and other
[18:23] countries they can only supposed to have
[18:26] so many nuclear bombs
[18:28] now it was almost there what they're
[18:30] doing is there this disassembling The
[18:32] Palms not making fun so you think other
[18:35] countries are going to be doing the same
[18:37] thing
[18:39] no
[18:43] so brother Brian I said when the bombs
[18:45] start dropping there's only one shelter
[18:47] we have and that is in Jesus Christ
[18:50] so but if you're a son or daughter of
[18:52] God and say if you're not a little ego
[18:54] because Jehovah evil will hide us on the
[18:58] cleft of the rock where nothing can harm
[19:01] us
[19:05] I like that song by The George sings I
[19:07] think they sang Nick last week
[19:10] says that he hired my soul he said he
[19:13] hired my soul in the cleft of The Rock
[19:16] their Shadows that drive thirsty land
[19:19] he hired in my life in the depth of his
[19:22] love and covers me there with his hands
[19:25] yeah
[19:32] Jesus talking to the woman at the well
[19:33] in John 4 13-14
[19:37] Jesus answered and said unto her
[19:39] whosoever drinked it up as water shall
[19:42] thirst again
[19:46] never thirst but the water that shall
[19:49] give him shall be in him and well the
[19:52] waters bringing up into everlasting life
[19:56] Exodus 33 20-22
[20:00] and he said thou cannot see my face but
[20:03] they're
[20:05] shall no man see me and live and the
[20:08] Lord said behold there is a place by me
[20:10] and not shall stand upon a rock
[20:13] all right and it shall come to pass for
[20:15] my glory past that I will put it in a
[20:18] cleft of The Rock and I will cover thee
[20:20] with my hand while I passed I guess
[20:22] that's where they got that song
[20:28] Psalms 18 2 the Lord is my rock and my
[20:31] Fortress and my deliverer my God my
[20:34] strength in whom I will trust my mother
[20:36] and the horn are my salvation and my
[20:39] high tower
[20:41] Psalms 105 38 for 1.
[20:44] he said Egypt was glad when they
[20:46] deported for the fear of them fell upon
[20:49] them
[20:49] he spread a clout for a cover and it's
[20:52] hard to give life in the night the
[20:55] people asked and he brought whales and
[20:57] satisfy them with the Bread of Heaven
[20:59] he opened the Rock and The Waters passed
[21:02] out and they ran and they dry in dry
[21:05] places like the river
[21:09] Psalm 78 15 16.
[21:13] declared the rocks in the wilderness and
[21:14] gave them drink as out of the Great
[21:16] deeps
[21:18] he brought them streams also out of the
[21:21] Rock and costs
[21:23] Waters to run down like Rivers
[21:26] anybody has any questions or comments or
[21:29] fire behind him
[21:32] yeah I just caught something which I
[21:35] never cut before when the Lord told
[21:38] Moses to speak to the Rock he smelled it
[21:42] but did he do it as a symbol when you
[21:45] read father speak to the Rock president
[21:48] said that's why God was too slide us but
[21:52] he smoked Christ
[21:54] is that and yeah like a type of it
[21:58] because I think Moses made a mistake
[22:01] well there's another scripture where it
[22:03] says
[22:04] wait till Smite The Rock but there's two
[22:08] different scriptures but I kind of went
[22:10] with this one because uh you can only
[22:12] crucify Christ once you know he can't
[22:17] crucify him again
[22:19] I mean we can crucify like I said
[22:21] rejecting his word but yeah
[22:24] okay
[22:27] thank you thank you
