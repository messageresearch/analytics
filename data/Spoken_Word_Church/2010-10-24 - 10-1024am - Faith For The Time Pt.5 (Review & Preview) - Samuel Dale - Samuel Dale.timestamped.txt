[35:52] and you that have had trouble you know
[35:55] enter there in and pray one for the
[35:58] other okay all right Hebrews 6 Romans 9
[36:01] Hebrews 4 Heavenly Father we thank you
[36:04] for a day and a time that we can gather
[36:07] together and just sit down for a little
[36:08] bit and just Fellowship around your word
[36:12] Lord because that should be our desire
[36:14] for all of the time to be able to come
[36:18] together and to listen from you cuz we
[36:23] we can read your word but it takes you
[36:25] to give us the understand it so just
[36:28] have your way now forgive our sins
[36:30] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[36:32] remember all the sick among us there's
[36:34] many things that here but you said you
[36:37] sent your word it healed us and
[36:39] delivered us from destruction thank you
[36:41] for all of the things the testimonies
[36:43] your love and your grace and Lord Just
[36:46] Have Your Way in Jesus name
[36:50] amen we read Hebrews
[36:53] 6 and just hold you page there and it'll
[36:56] be help you when you get back to Hebrews
[36:58] 4 cuz it's just over so Hebrews
[37:01] 6 therefore leaving the principles of
[37:04] the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[37:08] Perfection not laying again the
[37:10] foundation of repentance from dead works
[37:12] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[37:15] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[37:17] and of resurrection of the dead and of
[37:20] Eternal
[37:21] judgment this and this will we do if God
[37:25] permits all right now so I said just
[37:28] hold that and drop over to to Romans 8
[37:32] or excuse me Romans
[37:34] 9 and we'll read verse
[37:39] 30-33 what shall we say then that the
[37:42] Gentiles which followed not after
[37:44] righteousness have obtained to
[37:46] righteousness even the righteousness
[37:48] which is of Faith but Israel which
[37:51] followed after the law of righteousness
[37:53] hath not obtained to the law of
[37:55] righteousness wherefore other words why
[37:58] because they sought it not by faith but
[38:01] as it were by The Works of the law for
[38:04] they stumbled at The Stumbling stone
[38:07] that is is written behold I lay in Zion
[38:09] a stumbling
[38:11] stone and rock of offense and whosoever
[38:15] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[38:18] now go back over to Hebrews
[38:24] 4 let us therefore fear lest a promise
[38:28] being left us of entering into his rest
[38:31] any of you should seem to come short of
[38:33] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[38:36] well as unto them but the word preached
[38:39] did not profit them why not being mixed
[38:43] with faith in them that heard it you may
[38:46] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[38:49] the reading of the
[38:51] word now I wanted to
[38:54] uh continue on and
[38:59] you know we will but I mean I I wanted
[39:02] to uh bring another
[39:04] message and we'll take it up this
[39:07] afternoon but uh this has been on my
[39:11] mind all
[39:13] week and uh I just want to do it so
[39:16] we'll just we'll just review and preview
[39:20] a little bit of what we've been talking
[39:22] about and uh you know make sure that we
[39:27] understand it cuz I I was up this
[39:30] morning and i' been studied all
[39:31] yesterday afternoon for a long time and
[39:35] I was I'm completely satisfied with this
[39:38] afternoon message to to speak on it and
[39:41] have some thoughts going on down the
[39:43] line for other sermons but it just kept
[39:45] coming back and kept coming back so
[39:47] maybe we need to review a little bit you
[39:51] know of what we've been talking about
[39:53] and at least you'll know for sure what
[39:56] I'm saying and that way then you want to
[39:59] you know you want to misunderstand me
[40:02] but I I I don't want to just keep saying
[40:05] the same thing over again but Paul said
[40:08] sometimes that was
[40:09] needful because it's very helpful unto
[40:12] us all right but we've been talking
[40:15] about now for quite a while this is
[40:18] message number five we've been talking
[40:22] about going on to Perfection but we
[40:26] titled it faith for the time and uh you
[40:29] know trying to see why would Paul say
[40:35] that leaving the principles of the
[40:37] doctrines of Christ let us go on to
[40:39] Perfection you know he had a reason for
[40:42] saying that or he would not have made
[40:45] that statement and as I said to you then
[40:48] here's Paul preaching and he has the new
[40:53] birth and I believe that Paul had the
[40:56] the uh faith of the fathers you know I I
[41:00] believe that because of of him and what
[41:03] he was saying and how he was used to
[41:05] write the word and he went to the back
[41:07] side of the desert and stayed there for
[41:09] uh quite a while and came out and
[41:11] brother R said preaching the same thing
[41:13] that Peter did right so Paul was saying
[41:17] you know now let us lay aside not lay
[41:20] aside like do away
[41:22] with right that is not the understanding
[41:26] uh that is there it's not doing away
[41:30] with it U good to see our brother back
[41:32] there with us but I think he's been here
[41:34] before so okay forget it you get welcome
[41:37] that time good to see you though you but
[41:41] uh see
[41:43] Paul said then going on laying aside
[41:46] right and as I said you you build a
[41:48] building you pour the foundation right
[41:51] but you don't leave that Foundation
[41:53] right you build on top of it right but
[41:56] you must must leave the foundation cuz
[41:59] you're not back down hammering on it and
[42:01] chipping on it and working on it you're
[42:03] you you leave there so that's what Paul
[42:06] is saying to to go on to
[42:09] Perfection right and going on in the
[42:12] revealed word amen and that was his
[42:15] desire right all right so Paul would
[42:17] call it you know going on unto
[42:21] Perfection all right Peter would call it
[42:24] uh growing in Grace and knowledge
[42:27] you know and things like that and we
[42:29] know that the first thing that we've
[42:31] seen the very principles of all
[42:34] Christianity is the new birth right
[42:37] because that's where our beginning is at
[42:39] amen and we are to build a body of
[42:42] Christ amen and see then in building
[42:44] that we must go on and not just stay
[42:47] with the feet all the time and you know
[42:49] continue to to pick around on on little
[42:52] bitty things because uh you know we need
[42:55] to continue on that's right but see it's
[42:58] growing in Grace and knowledge so it
[43:01] will take the revealed word now that's
[43:04] my whole point right of of trying to
[43:06] bring it I wrote it in here twice to
[43:08] make sure and I underlined it but see
[43:12] perverted word that's it right there
[43:14] perverted word will not bring you unto
[43:17] Perfection amen that's right see there
[43:19] there's no way it's it's because you're
[43:22] you're trying to build a body of Christ
[43:24] and how can you put something in the
[43:26] body of Christ as you're coming down see
[43:29] that would would be different from what
[43:30] the others and in the Old Testament each
[43:33] one of those prophets they Dove tail
[43:36] together it may not sound like it
[43:38] sometimes but give it a little time and
[43:41] read it and they'll all be bringing the
[43:43] beautiful picture as it's building the
[43:46] body of
[43:47] Christ see then in the New
[43:50] Testament see we must build the body of
[43:54] Christ see the bride of Christ comes
[43:56] forth building a body upon Earth and in
[43:59] doing that it can't be perverted word
[44:02] right all right so we can't use that to
[44:08] to uh you know to say well we had this
[44:11] and we had that well we had part of it
[44:14] right right we understood things in part
[44:17] that's right but when that which is
[44:19] perfect the scripture says is come then
[44:21] that which is in part is done away
[44:23] that's right now Peter is not or Paul
[44:26] neither one is saying see to do
[44:32] away but don't stay down on the bottom
[44:35] all the
[44:36] time like I said people of the message
[44:39] will say we don't want to get into those
[44:41] deep things well now why did God write
[44:46] it in his word that's right amen it's
[44:48] not that now forgive me is not that the
[44:52] same way we talked when we were in
[44:54] organized religion and we said stay out
[44:57] of the Book of Revelations oh my cuz we
[45:00] don't understand it come on you you
[45:02] can't understand Genesis just be in the
[45:04] little simple things of the new birth
[45:07] and and and just being good people and
[45:10] all like that well now that's why I read
[45:12] what Paul said about the the children of
[45:15] Israel right because the children of
[45:19] Israel they was keeping the dos and the
[45:21] don'ts to the letter right I mean they
[45:25] had her down to the letter right but yet
[45:29] what was their trouble as Paul
[45:31] said that they were trying to
[45:35] establish not the righteousness of God
[45:38] by faith right but they were trying to
[45:41] establish their own
[45:43] righteousness I don't do this and I
[45:45] don't do that remember the the man
[45:47] praying you know and Lord I pr I do this
[45:50] and I'm not like that
[45:53] sinner but there was a sinner down there
[45:55] just saying Lord forgive me
[45:57] amen the scripture tells you which one
[45:59] was
[46:00] forgiven now but see Paul says the
[46:03] children of Israel sought it not by
[46:05] faith right all right by
[46:08] Revelation all right now could we be
[46:11] that way and just want to settle down
[46:14] and you know and and stay with the
[46:18] things when Paul was laying down some
[46:20] pretty good Doctrine and calling it
[46:24] principles one God
[46:28] baptisms resurrection of the Dead
[46:31] Eternal judgment those are pretty strong
[46:33] meat right you know I mean I'm not
[46:35] throwing that to anybody but you
[46:38] couldn't walk across the street over
[46:40] here to this church and preach those
[46:43] things
[46:44] right see you would be ousted after just
[46:48] a little bit right you know why because
[46:51] they don't believe it that's right right
[46:54] but now for us to stay on those little
[46:57] things was my whole
[46:59] point see then we can be like Israel and
[47:03] we canot seek it by faith see and be as
[47:07] we read in in Hebrews that the gospel
[47:11] being preached unto
[47:13] us it won't profit us
[47:17] anything well if I just get to heaven
[47:19] well that's that's a good point that's
[47:21] that's all right but
[47:27] we're not in the time of just saying
[47:29] let's be good and go to church and you
[47:32] know that's that's not today you and I
[47:35] living that was a day and a time to just
[47:38] call yourself a Christian at one time
[47:40] would get you killed right but see we're
[47:43] protected by the law and we thank God
[47:45] for it and and the things today to be
[47:47] able to to believe what we believe but
[47:50] that will be fastly taken from
[47:52] us but the thing of it is in the
[47:58] time that we
[48:00] have see we should spend our time trying
[48:04] to to uh lay up right you know now if
[48:09] you knew you know if you knew that next
[48:12] year we're all going to be without a job
[48:15] and we got a couple of more months or
[48:16] three or something you know the end of
[48:18] the year uh the what would you do if you
[48:22] knew everybody's going to be out of work
[48:23] next year what would you do right now
[48:26] not just halfhazard but knowing that
[48:28] everything going to be out Ain going to
[48:30] be working well everybody' be storing up
[48:33] a little money right everybody be
[48:35] putting you wouldn't be going out and
[48:37] buying all these fancy new stuff you'd
[48:39] be buying some food you'd be buying the
[48:42] Necessities to be able to live for a
[48:44] year all right now is that true well see
[48:48] then that's the way it should be in the
[48:50] gospel right in the gospel we should be
[48:55] getting prepared
[48:57] for whatever will come all right which
[49:01] means we need to get into the word right
[49:05] amen right see we need to get into the
[49:07] reveal word now when I say word that's
[49:10] right I'm not talking about letters on a
[49:12] page right amen when I talk about the
[49:15] word of God I'm talking about the
[49:16] revealed word of God Amen because we
[49:19] prove through the point of our many
[49:22] messages that we can actually take the
[49:24] letter of the word
[49:27] and Paul look at the statement he made
[49:29] he said the letter kill it
[49:33] right now he was
[49:35] saying even the things he
[49:39] preached would kill us right if it
[49:42] wasn't revealed amen
[49:45] right see I'm talking about the revealed
[49:47] word see and we must in this day believe
[49:50] that God has given us the fully revealed
[49:54] work now I got it right over here so
[49:57] I'll just read it to you you say well
[49:59] brother Dale do you believe you have the
[50:01] perfect
[50:02] interpretation I have the message right
[50:07] right I believe the message is perfect
[50:10] right
[50:12] now and I believe that what's been
[50:15] revealed to me is perfect
[50:17] amen all right amen I believe what's
[50:19] been revealed to you is perfect right
[50:21] that's what makes it perfect see when
[50:24] it's revealed not letters come on not to
[50:27] be able to quote it not to be able to
[50:29] read it off the computer screen right
[50:32] right but for it to be a reality living
[50:34] in our hearts and lives we see that way
[50:37] then so you can't leave the principles
[50:40] like we interpret that is saying because
[50:44] the principles that that we stand on was
[50:47] the revelation of one
[50:49] God the revelation of you
[50:53] know the
[50:55] Resurrection The revelation of
[50:58] the judgment and how it can be see those
[51:03] are part of it but we can't stay on
[51:07] that we must continue on that's right
[51:11] amen now what I'll be doing in the next
[51:14] couple of services I know will be
[51:17] illustrating some things to you all
[51:20] right now I I try to do that because I
[51:24] believe illustrations help if if we had
[51:27] a drawing board we'd draw it out you
[51:29] know up here and I know we can set up
[51:31] some things but we just not set up too
[51:33] good for for that but I believe
[51:38] illustrations help right amen and I
[51:41] believe reminding us
[51:43] helps right and see that way then you
[51:46] can't come up and say well brother Dale
[51:47] you said so and so I said what H that's
[51:51] right but I Illustrated it to you I
[51:54] showed you what I meant by what I was
[51:55] saying right
[51:57] I I like to use illustrations because
[52:01] that that opens the mind of the
[52:04] individual to be able to receive and
[52:07] we'll be taking some things to show how
[52:10] did you
[52:11] start and go
[52:15] on you can take the Bible you can take
[52:18] the prophet's message and you can
[52:20] isolate one thing and you can bring it
[52:24] from the Bible and the prophet's message
[52:26] message as to what you're talking
[52:30] about and it be right what you're
[52:34] saying but yet then something else will
[52:37] be
[52:39] said well what are you going to do with
[52:42] that well I'm going to just stay with
[52:45] this well now that's not going on that's
[52:48] right right that's right going on is to
[52:52] to take what you've got the new birth is
[52:55] where you must start at right all right
[52:57] right the Apostle Paul had the new birth
[53:00] amen all right and we'd have to agree by
[53:03] the time he come here in Hebrews of
[53:05] writing that he was standing there with
[53:08] the faith of the fathers even to
[53:10] understand greater things than the Peter
[53:13] and the apostles did right all right and
[53:16] and doing that then Paul
[53:19] says
[53:21] okay all right we're in 100% agreement
[53:25] we need a new birth
[53:28] that's number one we need the
[53:30] understanding of one God
[53:33] right we need to understand the
[53:36] resurrection that's right and about hell
[53:38] and how it can not be
[53:42] Eternal but yet God can have eternal
[53:44] judgment because once he judges you
[53:47] that's judgment's over there's no court
[53:49] of
[53:50] appeal see he saying then now let's go
[53:55] on let's eat the the greater things you
[53:59] remember the children of
[54:01] Israel they had Mana you know in the
[54:04] wilderness the bread came down the Mana
[54:07] right you know people don't take hear me
[54:09] they don't understand what words I'm
[54:10] saying but the bread in the wilderness m
[54:13] a n n a n I guess is or n m a n n a all
[54:18] right but
[54:20] see they had that mana and it was
[54:22] beautiful right it was wonderful and
[54:25] they lived by each
[54:29] day and it came each day but they
[54:32] couldn't hold over
[54:34] right see because that would be the
[54:37] example of doing what we're saying
[54:39] staying on the
[54:41] foundation let me get a little extra
[54:43] today because it might not be any
[54:45] tomorrow well now that's doubting
[54:47] God I mean if he bring it one day why
[54:51] can't he bring it the next
[54:54] day so you said yeah with little quick
[54:56] well you know there was a time the Mana
[54:57] did cease you know what right you did
[55:00] her Bible learned you know what I'm tell
[55:02] you when they entered the promised land
[55:04] the land of Canaan right and they ate of
[55:07] the old corn of the land you know the
[55:10] manist
[55:12] righten all right but what did they
[55:15] do well don't have anything to eat I
[55:19] guess if we get anything to eat we got
[55:21] across Jordan which is type of death you
[55:23] know but we got to across Jordan we got
[55:26] got to go back in the wilderness and
[55:28] find the
[55:30] Mana no what happened
[55:33] amen the old corn of the land became a
[55:38] stronger meat unto them you know a meal
[55:41] unto them right than what the Mana
[55:44] was and it wasn't getting something you
[55:47] know it was the same thing it was just
[55:49] not God bringing it to them from on they
[55:51] were going to have to do some things to
[55:52] get it yourself but now when they first
[55:55] got there they didn't have to
[55:57] right he gave it to them see showing
[56:01] what it was going to be and the prophet
[56:02] of God said what a deeper revelation of
[56:05] the word of God right Amen in the
[56:09] adoption series he covers that a deeper
[56:12] Revelation am was what the old corn
[56:15] stood for all right now then it's in the
[56:19] Bible that we can bring it out to show
[56:21] you know from the from this to this and
[56:23] this to this and this to this see
[56:27] but there was a day the Mana was
[56:29] perfect but there was a day when you
[56:34] couldn't go out and gather it but to
[56:37] show that it was part of the word of
[56:41] God and not leaving the principles like
[56:44] we think y then they took a
[56:49] pot and they put the Mana down in the
[56:52] pot they put the pot behind the veil in
[56:55] the inner Veil you know inner Court not
[56:57] just the the second Veil and sometimes
[57:00] you you you got confusion in that and
[57:02] and you you don't understand um you know
[57:05] David went in and ate the shoe bread
[57:07] right but you better check it out the
[57:09] shoe bread is not the Mana right see you
[57:12] study here I send you second court right
[57:16] he didn't go behind the veil he would
[57:18] have been killed right amen all right
[57:20] but see then check that out but see
[57:22] behind the veil there was a
[57:25] pot and you know what I'm just honest I
[57:28] swe I think no I think if they still had
[57:31] that pot and could find it that that
[57:33] Mana would still be good right
[57:35] amen cuz it was set aside for each
[57:38] priest right the succession of priest
[57:42] that would come they would be able to
[57:44] reach in and get a B they couldn't take
[57:47] a handful in their pocket and take it
[57:49] out with them you know they they
[57:51] couldn't do nothing like that but it
[57:52] showed that leaving the principles is
[57:55] not like what we think right is taking
[57:59] that as a foundation and continue on
[58:02] amen that's right it's like your Prophet
[58:04] preaching one true and living
[58:08] God and then one day God opened the
[58:11] seals to him right then we'll get back
[58:14] to this and what did he say in other
[58:16] words what
[58:18] happened he said my Revelation right
[58:22] right that Jesus and God is a self-same
[58:25] person amen
[58:27] he said thereby amen that's got to be
[58:30] the
[58:31] Antichrist because he knew what he's
[58:33] talking about right why the the the Mana
[58:36] had become the old corn right he kept
[58:40] going on in the
[58:42] word and see there's Paul now watch it
[58:46] Paul back there so I'm going to try to
[58:48] come through now and listen Paul back
[58:51] there in the he had the new
[58:54] birth right and he was going on to
[58:57] Perfection right well you know what
[59:00] brought it brought him to the Statue of
[59:01] a perfect man where we call it the faith
[59:03] of the
[59:04] fathers all right right okay he brought
[59:08] him to that place that was Perfection
[59:11] compared to his Perfection of the new
[59:14] birth amen that was greater Perfection
[59:17] not something different it was like the
[59:20] Mana and the old corn it was just going
[59:22] on in the word it was a greater opening
[59:25] of the word right right right now see
[59:29] that went down through a while but it
[59:31] was
[59:32] lost in the Dark Ages not the holy the
[59:36] Holy Spirit was not taken away it was
[59:39] the word that was taken away the the
[59:41] ability to be able to understand was
[59:43] taken away all right but see Martin
[59:46] Luther came out one day preaching the
[59:48] just shall live by
[59:50] faith now watch that this afternoon
[59:57] that just shall live by faith put them
[59:59] people if they believed it in the body
[1:00:02] of Christ right
[1:00:05] right he put them in the body of Christ
[1:00:09] cuz it was a new birth right
[1:00:12] and Martin Luther would say now let's go
[1:00:15] on see he could read Paul let's go on to
[1:00:18] Perfection he probably wondered what
[1:00:20] that meant and pondered it but he still
[1:00:23] wanted to go
[1:00:24] on some of those people went on and
[1:00:27] picked up in the days of John
[1:00:31] Wesley see some of them said we're going
[1:00:33] to stay with Luther
[1:00:35] yep we got it we got the books we got
[1:00:38] the texes we got it all set up like the
[1:00:40] people of the message today right we got
[1:00:42] it all ready let's stay with this and
[1:00:46] watch them deep things now watch them
[1:00:48] intellectual preachers and all they'll
[1:00:51] they'll they'll confuse you you know
[1:00:54] they they they'll mess you up cuz
[1:00:56] they're just preaching about
[1:00:58] intellect well what's wrong with the
[1:01:00] people that can't preach at all that's
[1:01:03] right I'm sorry I'm just I'm blunt oh
[1:01:07] Lord you know my thought's always been
[1:01:10] one
[1:01:11] thing if it was not for us why did God
[1:01:14] put it in the word that's right and if
[1:01:16] the message is not for us why did God
[1:01:19] send a prophet to preach it to us all he
[1:01:21] had to do is send him down and tell him
[1:01:23] you got it sit down take it easy we'll
[1:01:25] get out of your a while no that Prophet
[1:01:28] was constantly why because down to those
[1:01:32] dark ages and the things we could go
[1:01:33] through a long course of
[1:01:36] it actually what they done when they
[1:01:39] when they cabbage down on that word it
[1:01:41] become a caral reform right a time of
[1:01:44] reformation
[1:01:46] right now remember we read that from the
[1:01:48] prophet so you can take this message and
[1:01:51] make it carnal reform right I'm still
[1:01:54] thinking you're in the message when
[1:01:55] you're only in Reformation right
[1:01:57] Reformation is simply just quitting what
[1:01:59] you're doing and go start doing
[1:02:01] something else right and that's the way
[1:02:03] the people are the message people
[1:02:05] believe and if it's your then you know
[1:02:06] I'm against it people say well we come
[1:02:08] in the message what else you want me to
[1:02:09] do right I mean we're in the message
[1:02:13] well see that becomes stale stagnant
[1:02:16] because we must keep on growing amen
[1:02:19] right I have always tried to keep
[1:02:22] something out ahead of you right
[1:02:26] to to be able to keep you interested in
[1:02:30] coming back to hear the rest of the
[1:02:32] story Paul Harvey would
[1:02:35] say cuz I I see I want to go
[1:02:39] on but God sent a prophet see to restore
[1:02:43] those things that's right and he had to
[1:02:45] be standing with the faith of the
[1:02:47] fathers or God would have not ow
[1:02:50] unfolded the rest of the word under him
[1:02:52] right amen but he had to grow into that
[1:02:54] right amen but remember remember he was
[1:02:56] a prophet you said who taught brother
[1:02:58] ROM God did who taught Paul right right
[1:03:02] all right right who taught Paul he said
[1:03:04] nobody didn't teach him I didn't get it
[1:03:06] from man he got on the back side of the
[1:03:07] Desert from God why because he was a
[1:03:09] prophet
[1:03:11] right now here's my point you just me
[1:03:15] and you couldn't wear out on the back
[1:03:17] side of the desert and get it ourselves
[1:03:18] see that's what we think right you can't
[1:03:20] do it God had to send us a prophet Amen
[1:03:24] to be able to teach us us the revelation
[1:03:27] of the word of God right but that
[1:03:29] Prophet was constantly going on to
[1:03:32] Perfection what he would see one day
[1:03:35] then he he'd see something then he'd
[1:03:37] climb and he'd see something he'd climb
[1:03:38] and he'd see something I listening to
[1:03:40] him one day on on a tape and I thought
[1:03:42] oh God you know he said now I got a
[1:03:45] scripture right
[1:03:48] here he preached and he preached and he
[1:03:50] preached and at while he'd say now now I
[1:03:53] got another scripture listen to it you
[1:03:55] know what cuz he preached up that point
[1:03:57] and then something else was
[1:03:59] unfolding something else was unfolding
[1:04:02] it's a constant climbing is not doing
[1:04:05] away with
[1:04:06] anything that's right Martin Luther the
[1:04:09] truth of the just shall live by faith is
[1:04:11] a basic foundation for
[1:04:16] Christianity but to stay with what he
[1:04:19] taught would become dead works that's
[1:04:22] right was that what Paul called it amen
[1:04:26] for us to just stay with the message is
[1:04:28] you know well well we understand we
[1:04:30] believe this and we believe that you
[1:04:34] know but we don't believe we don't want
[1:04:36] to go any further now
[1:04:39] why what are you afraid
[1:04:42] of well brother I'm afraid of getting
[1:04:44] confused don't worry about it that's
[1:04:47] right you born that way right you know
[1:04:51] and until God reveals it we're still
[1:04:53] that
[1:04:54] way that's right if there something
[1:04:56] you're looking in the Bible you're
[1:04:57] looking in the prophet's message and you
[1:05:00] see it looks like two things y you know
[1:05:04] or some contradiction just remember you
[1:05:06] don't see the Revelation that's right
[1:05:08] that's sensible right
[1:05:11] right I sat down many a time and and
[1:05:14] studied on the godhead and I could just
[1:05:16] see it so beautiful it would just
[1:05:19] unfold Through the Bible the next day
[1:05:23] you could ask me what I saw and I
[1:05:24] couldn't even tell you right
[1:05:26] amen come on are you that way right
[1:05:29] because see it's it's something else
[1:05:31] that God wants to reveal come on and
[1:05:34] like I've always tried to tell you what
[1:05:36] we have today is just a foundation when
[1:05:39] we come to tomorrow oh my come on
[1:05:43] right what we have today what we hear
[1:05:46] today if you hear something today that
[1:05:48] you hadn't heard you know put together
[1:05:51] in a way for God to reveal it I don't
[1:05:53] mean you hadn't heard the words right
[1:05:54] right you know what that tomorrow will
[1:05:57] be that'll just be a foundation that's
[1:05:59] right you know what it'll be a former
[1:06:02] rain come
[1:06:04] on it'll be a former rain see because
[1:06:08] the latter rain must
[1:06:11] come on each one of the forers or
[1:06:14] there's no need of it all right but you
[1:06:16] understand what I'm saying yes see then
[1:06:19] when this message
[1:06:21] came this message is to take you and I
[1:06:24] to a change of the
[1:06:28] you agree to a change and a Rapture
[1:06:31] we're not looking for something other
[1:06:32] somewhere another Messenger to come
[1:06:35] brother Dale to be able to tell you what
[1:06:37] it is no I can't tell you what it is the
[1:06:39] Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the
[1:06:41] word amen but neither can brother random
[1:06:43] tell you what it is come on brother it
[1:06:46] takes God to reveal it that's right he
[1:06:48] can say the letter of the words and the
[1:06:50] things and surely we know perfectly well
[1:06:54] that he never brought is perverted word
[1:06:56] come
[1:06:58] on what was the things that was not
[1:07:00] right like the White Horse riter Etc he
[1:07:03] corrected himself right that's right
[1:07:07] what had to be corrected about the
[1:07:09] understanding of the evidence of the
[1:07:10] Holy Ghost he told us that right and he
[1:07:14] said I used to believe
[1:07:16] that we said I don't believe that
[1:07:19] now you know why he is going on to
[1:07:23] Perfection amen the that's right through
[1:07:26] the revealing of God's word will take
[1:07:29] you and I to Perfection that's
[1:07:32] right we don't have to go somewhere
[1:07:36] else the prophet turned us back to the
[1:07:39] Bible that's right right and see then if
[1:07:42] we can't take the Bible and the
[1:07:45] prophet's
[1:07:46] message right people will argue and say
[1:07:49] well brother R's not here but the
[1:07:51] message is here right that's right
[1:07:55] you know I mean one thing for certain at
[1:07:59] least we can sit down now with the
[1:08:01] computer abilities the way we have it
[1:08:03] and we can sit down and and discuss
[1:08:09] something and we have the ability to be
[1:08:12] able to cover the whole
[1:08:14] message whereas it used to be I remember
[1:08:17] brother Mo telling this he heard brother
[1:08:18] brandham you know one day when he was up
[1:08:20] at Jeffersonville there preaching and he
[1:08:23] he heard him he said and said there was
[1:08:25] Adam said he sinned and was cast out of
[1:08:28] the
[1:08:30] garden he said you know what it was
[1:08:32] months before we ever got another tape
[1:08:35] or heard another
[1:08:36] sermon and said you know what I thought
[1:08:38] during that time there was Adam cast out
[1:08:40] of the garden because he
[1:08:42] sinned I said that looks bad he said but
[1:08:46] then one day we got a takee and brother
[1:08:48] Ram said but when Adam was cast out of
[1:08:51] the garden that he had an atonement made
[1:08:53] for him he had a covering we see that
[1:08:56] took it
[1:08:58] away and that's all I'm trying to do
[1:09:00] about all the
[1:09:03] word it's not to show how smart you
[1:09:06] are but it's to show that God's word is
[1:09:12] perfect and we must go on in the
[1:09:15] revealing of the word but part word now
[1:09:19] what go this see perverted word won't do
[1:09:22] it we' all agree that yes h but see part
[1:09:26] word won't do it
[1:09:28] right part word comes because of our
[1:09:32] ignorance because we haven't heard maybe
[1:09:35] right amen that could be part
[1:09:38] word but see then when we sat down and
[1:09:41] cabage down on it and refuse to go
[1:09:44] on then what we have will become part
[1:09:48] word and there's no way to go to
[1:09:50] Perfection that's right
[1:09:53] amen I I I what I don't understand I'm
[1:09:56] honest I'm
[1:09:58] sorry I'm just an old human
[1:10:01] being and I just talk human I just don't
[1:10:05] understand how that we can have this
[1:10:08] message as it
[1:10:10] is and then there' be so
[1:10:14] many
[1:10:19] splits doctrinal issues that people
[1:10:22] differ about
[1:10:25] out of one
[1:10:28] message amen right the Baptist is not
[1:10:31] that confusing
[1:10:33] right is that true
[1:10:36] right they may argue and fuss over a
[1:10:39] little bit thing but they'll tell you
[1:10:40] the basics
[1:10:43] right you going to get baptized that's
[1:10:46] right if you go to that Baptist Church
[1:10:48] right I don't care how many times you've
[1:10:50] been
[1:10:52] baptized I don't care if the pope of
[1:10:54] Rome baptized you and and dedicated you
[1:10:57] and whatever he done I don't care who
[1:10:59] done it you go into the Baptist Church
[1:11:01] you're going to get baptized that's a
[1:11:04] Basics to see in this message is just
[1:11:06] anything just well there don't go off on
[1:11:09] that brother he that's just his way of
[1:11:11] seeing it now you mean there's two ways
[1:11:13] of seeing
[1:11:15] something that problem long time ago you
[1:11:19] know I don't believe in two ways to see
[1:11:21] something well you just we just you just
[1:11:23] stubborn about what well come in let's
[1:11:25] talk about it I've always been willing
[1:11:27] to sit down and discuss what I believe
[1:11:31] right but is always say now don't come
[1:11:33] along with a little six or seven and
[1:11:35] start talking about brother d i don't
[1:11:37] agree with you on some statements you
[1:11:38] made the other day you
[1:11:40] know now show it to me prove to me in
[1:11:43] the Bible where I'm wrong
[1:11:46] right why because I want to go on Amen
[1:11:50] see we talk about a
[1:11:52] Rapture when your Prophet told us what
[1:11:55] it
[1:11:57] was he said the Rapture is a
[1:12:02] revelation well what are we looking for
[1:12:05] he didn't say the Rapture is reading
[1:12:06] this message he didn't say the Rapture
[1:12:09] was studying this message putting it
[1:12:11] together doing a great discourse upon
[1:12:14] something you know what I'm saying and
[1:12:15] taking all the quotes right the computer
[1:12:19] is not going in the
[1:12:22] Rapture you may think a lot of your on
[1:12:25] it 9 10 12 hours a day but that's good
[1:12:31] brother no it's not going that's right
[1:12:35] the the books and the tapes is not going
[1:12:37] that's
[1:12:38] right it's a group of
[1:12:40] people that the word becomes alive in
[1:12:43] them is where the Rapture is going to be
[1:12:46] the prophet said the bride would be
[1:12:49] Wai amen the bride would be waiting for
[1:12:52] the revelation of the Rapture come on
[1:12:54] well you know what waiting for the
[1:12:55] revelation of rapture means
[1:12:57] right if I don't have the revelation of
[1:13:00] rapture right now you know what that
[1:13:01] statement said I'm waiting for it that's
[1:13:03] right
[1:13:04] amen but when it
[1:13:08] comes see I won't be waiting for it
[1:13:11] that's right amen now I may have to wait
[1:13:13] for it to be made manifest see Paul
[1:13:16] that's what I tried to show you what
[1:13:18] Paul was doing when Paul said you
[1:13:19] chaining a on the trick of an ey he had
[1:13:22] the Revelation he seen it right but he
[1:13:25] couldn't attain un to that's
[1:13:27] right cuz had he done that you and I
[1:13:30] wouldn't be here that's right amen
[1:13:32] praise the Lord amen he said but we'll
[1:13:35] go on to these things if God permit
[1:13:37] that's
[1:13:38] right but you know God didn't permit him
[1:13:40] to go on that's right
[1:13:43] right but you know what I'm standing on
[1:13:45] today you know the Revelation that I'm
[1:13:48] waiting on today on the revelation of
[1:13:50] rapture is what he showed Paul that's
[1:13:52] right that's right he said number
[1:13:54] brother I want your you don't know what
[1:13:56] you're talking about that's right
[1:13:57] because if it won't compare to what Paul
[1:14:00] said right and if it's not the same
[1:14:02] Revelation Paul had then brother Ram
[1:14:04] didn't have the right Revelation that's
[1:14:06] right amen that's right and when he said
[1:14:08] we have the perfect interpretation come
[1:14:10] on he didn't stop at that he said with
[1:14:14] Divine Vindication in other words God
[1:14:17] Vindicated it right Paul God Vindicated
[1:14:21] what Paul said right
[1:14:23] amen right right right now if you don't
[1:14:26] get it how Vindicated get this one thing
[1:14:29] what Paul said I'm looking forward to it
[1:14:33] amen right amen so the Vindication is
[1:14:36] the people who believe the word of God
[1:14:40] righten let us go on to Perfection amen
[1:14:45] let us keep praying God give us each day
[1:14:48] our daily
[1:14:51] bread what we have
[1:14:54] today I mean man you can eat a seven
[1:14:56] course meal you can do all you want to
[1:15:00] but you know
[1:15:04] tomorrow you can talk all you want to
[1:15:07] about it
[1:15:10] that's Brother Gary back there has
[1:15:12] always wanted to go out there and try
[1:15:13] that 72 oce steak and I'd like to go
[1:15:15] with him I believe if anybody get close
[1:15:17] to eating it he
[1:15:19] can but you know what if he ate the
[1:15:22] whole time that's right
[1:15:25] the next day he could talk about it but
[1:15:28] you know what that old gut would be
[1:15:30] growling like
[1:15:33] everything that's the only thing I've
[1:15:35] ever done in the message of the hour and
[1:15:38] I realize that what we have
[1:15:41] today becomes a former Reign for God to
[1:15:45] be able to move on right and bring more
[1:15:48] unto usen that's right
[1:15:51] am to open the word
[1:15:55] so then perverted word we're not even
[1:15:57] talking about
[1:15:59] it that's not what Paul is talking about
[1:16:02] there in in
[1:16:05] Romans they had the word of God right
[1:16:11] those children of Israel had the word to
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:16] letter but they sought it not by faith
[1:16:19] that's right
[1:16:20] amen they could explain all of them
[1:16:23] seven compound names with Jehovah but
[1:16:25] they could explain every scripture it's
[1:16:27] even said that they a scroll could be
[1:16:28] wrote up and they could stick a pen
[1:16:30] through there and they could tell you
[1:16:31] the letters that it went through right
[1:16:34] why because they had read it so many
[1:16:38] times but Paul said now your problem
[1:16:43] is you're not seeking it by faith
[1:16:47] amen you're not seeking a revelation of
[1:16:51] what that is you're only wanting to do
[1:16:54] or don't do right and you think by doing
[1:16:57] or don't doing that that's going to make
[1:16:59] you a place
[1:17:01] right but you see
[1:17:03] church I've said over and over we can
[1:17:05] have this letter to the this message
[1:17:07] letter to the perfect but if it's not
[1:17:14] revealed then I believe that the things
[1:17:16] blood of random said if we wait upon a
[1:17:19] revelation they will come together I
[1:17:21] believe that amen amen right something
[1:17:24] he would say one day looking totally
[1:17:26] contrary to what he would say even maybe
[1:17:28] in the same
[1:17:31] message statements he'd make if we wait
[1:17:35] upon God and let him reveal it you'll
[1:17:36] find out brother around couldn't say it
[1:17:38] no other way
[1:17:41] right you know on the Statue of perfect
[1:17:43] man that brother ROM never read the
[1:17:45] scripture over the other scripture where
[1:17:47] it talks about the stature of a perfect
[1:17:49] man right the fullness of stature he
[1:17:52] didn't read that yeah my wife asked me
[1:17:55] one day saidh didn't he read this
[1:17:57] scripture I said because the Holy Ghost
[1:17:58] didn't want him to read it
[1:18:01] right that he didn't use that one
[1:18:04] scripture would have been really the
[1:18:05] very wording that right see you know why
[1:18:09] God didn't want him to
[1:18:13] right see sometimes in my preaching I
[1:18:16] know and realize that that I try my best
[1:18:19] to bring something down so close until I
[1:18:22] realized that I have to watch it cuz
[1:18:24] Satan can get there
[1:18:27] right and he can tell you that that's
[1:18:29] what you
[1:18:32] got because it's been brought down so
[1:18:35] straight and so perfect until there's no
[1:18:37] way to argue about
[1:18:38] it well I just don't believe it well
[1:18:41] that's all
[1:18:43] right it's all
[1:18:45] right but don't blame me for wanting to
[1:18:48] go on
[1:18:49] right when we left to church and came
[1:18:52] here and started this work the first
[1:18:54] church first message I preached was
[1:18:56] going Beyond man's
[1:18:59] Camp I'm still want to do
[1:19:02] that that's still my goal is to go
[1:19:05] beyond man's Camp because man's Camp
[1:19:07] will sit down and die on
[1:19:09] something I want to go on I want to keep
[1:19:12] going on see why because the Rapture is
[1:19:15] a
[1:19:17] revelation we read that see and we get
[1:19:19] to Great Revelation about it but we fail
[1:19:21] to read the same sentence where he said
[1:19:23] and the bride will will be waiting for
[1:19:25] the revelation of the
[1:19:29] Rapture and I've told you what I believe
[1:19:31] I don't believe the Rapture could have
[1:19:33] ever taken place if brother random had
[1:19:34] to come and preach that message I
[1:19:37] Hest why because he was putting together
[1:19:40] all of the scriptures that's
[1:19:44] right and you go back to the Rapture and
[1:19:47] find out if I'm not right that he covers
[1:19:48] from the New Birth all the way
[1:19:51] up he doesn't leave all of this
[1:19:56] is part of it leaving the principles and
[1:19:59] going on to Perfection is not leaving
[1:20:01] word that is revealed it is leaving our
[1:20:04] dead letter form that we thought made us
[1:20:06] right it is the things that we didn't
[1:20:09] have right it was the partial
[1:20:11] realization that we were just trying to
[1:20:13] hold on to that we think that's
[1:20:17] it we must go on to perfect
[1:20:21] realization and then the word will fit
[1:20:23] together M amen things that I studied on
[1:20:27] I've studied on some things for 20 years
[1:20:30] before I ever preach
[1:20:31] it and I could give you every quote and
[1:20:34] every scripture that brother ROM
[1:20:36] used but I would not preach it until God
[1:20:39] revealed
[1:20:42] it how many of people in the message
[1:20:45] would open they say that they' studied
[1:20:46] on something 20 years before they preach
[1:20:48] it I just get what the prophet said and
[1:20:51] I just preach it it's up to God to you
[1:20:53] that's why there's so much error that's
[1:20:55] right that's right so much
[1:21:00] error brother brand makes some
[1:21:02] statements and those statements he made
[1:21:04] keeps me from preaching some things that
[1:21:06] I believe I could
[1:21:07] see but you know what when he made the
[1:21:11] statement he's the prophet not me that's
[1:21:17] right but you understand what I'm trying
[1:21:19] to say yes we say we have the complete
[1:21:26] interpretation and that's what your
[1:21:28] Prophet said that was one of the last
[1:21:29] quotes of the
[1:21:33] day and I
[1:21:35] believe that this message of the
[1:21:38] hour not the way so and so interprets so
[1:21:41] and so brother Dale interprets anybody
[1:21:43] interprets not any of that I believe the
[1:21:46] message is the perfect interpretation
[1:21:49] amen perfect enough to take us in a
[1:21:52] Rapture right Amen to change these our
[1:21:54] bodies and take us into right
[1:21:57] right I believe
[1:22:01] that but you see when we're looking at
[1:22:04] something and we see it and it looks
[1:22:08] contradictory you cannot rightly have
[1:22:12] faith right that's where somebody like
[1:22:14] me comes
[1:22:15] along you know brother D what are you
[1:22:19] I'm just
[1:22:20] me people have said I'm a teacher well
[1:22:24] if I I am a
[1:22:27] teacher now you got plent plenty of
[1:22:29] quotes from brother brandom that said
[1:22:30] the teachers is when messed it up
[1:22:35] oh but do you go on and quote the rest
[1:22:38] of it where that R said that that nobody
[1:22:40] touch the teacher putting it together
[1:22:42] and do you read the others where he said
[1:22:44] the teacher is the one that positionally
[1:22:45] places you in the body see see you can
[1:22:49] use quotes for what you
[1:22:52] want you can make the teacher look bad
[1:22:55] that's right now honestly that poor
[1:22:58] brother R said the teachers in Christ of
[1:23:00] Min God reveal I'm pretty sure he said
[1:23:02] where the teachers is
[1:23:05] one I believe that the fivefold
[1:23:07] Ministries he's talking about right amen
[1:23:10] not just one teachers he's talking about
[1:23:13] all the teachers of the fivefold
[1:23:15] ministry not just a
[1:23:17] teacher right and I'm not defending that
[1:23:20] point I'm just making a statement
[1:23:22] right because Ever every
[1:23:27] preacher don't matter where your Apostle
[1:23:29] Prophet Pastor V teacher whatever you're
[1:23:32] supposed to be able to teach in the
[1:23:33] capacity that you
[1:23:37] are see we can say it and say well now
[1:23:39] the teachers when messed it up we see
[1:23:41] what are you trying to
[1:23:43] say I'll tell you what one man
[1:23:48] said he said that it was not the
[1:23:51] five-fold ministry that went off the
[1:23:53] word in the Dark Ages it was the deacons
[1:23:57] the elders etc
[1:23:59] etc well he was the one that wrote the
[1:24:04] book you know yeah I'm just telling you
[1:24:08] he was the one that wrote the book in
[1:24:10] the book The Church age
[1:24:12] book in the church age book brother R
[1:24:14] said it was the five-fold ministry that
[1:24:16] went off in the ages that's
[1:24:18] right what right see but yet he says
[1:24:23] that it wasn't a fivefold Ministry going
[1:24:24] on well you know who I'm going to
[1:24:25] believe right amen but I don't
[1:24:28] understand how you can sit down and pin
[1:24:30] something and then come out with an idea
[1:24:31] like that I don't get that but let's
[1:24:34] just
[1:24:36] listen when the word is fully revealed
[1:24:39] the Rapture will come right I believe
[1:24:42] that I said fully revealed
[1:24:45] amen now that's around the world Amen
[1:24:48] right that is not just
[1:24:50] Lula
[1:24:52] right around the world amen when the
[1:24:55] word is fully revealed then the Rapture
[1:24:58] will come because the revealed word can
[1:25:02] never be perverted word come on God
[1:25:05] can't God can't reveal a Trinity there's
[1:25:08] no such thing
[1:25:10] right people are say oh I got that
[1:25:12] Revelation in the Trinity where'd you
[1:25:14] get it you didn't get it from
[1:25:16] God cuz God don't know a Trinity
[1:25:20] right well I'm just trying to explain
[1:25:23] something well what you're trying to
[1:25:24] explain sure is messed up that's
[1:25:27] right like I said now see there's no
[1:25:30] doubt about the word of
[1:25:34] God there shouldn't be we have the texes
[1:25:37] we have the books we have the computer
[1:25:40] to be able to run it with and the only
[1:25:42] reason I use the word computer is the
[1:25:45] fact that you can just run so much of it
[1:25:46] that's right amen people say I don't
[1:25:48] like them old computers and that
[1:25:50] computer ain't going to say nothing that
[1:25:51] that ain't put in it that's right
[1:25:55] I'll just stay with the books well I can
[1:25:57] show you some places in the books used
[1:25:59] to be a lot of them that there's a lot
[1:26:00] of mistakes made in the
[1:26:04] books see because some man wouldn't put
[1:26:06] that in the book for took it off and put
[1:26:08] it in the book for well now see but
[1:26:12] let's don't be like one man told waiting
[1:26:14] us one time he said we're talking in a
[1:26:17] group I've told you about it my wife
[1:26:19] punched me cuz she thought I was going
[1:26:20] to take it up because but the man said I
[1:26:23] don't read that Church A's
[1:26:25] book oh said the reason I don't said
[1:26:28] Le's wife wrote it
[1:26:33] yeah she said I'm no not hearing a big
[1:26:38] crowd the next morning I just mentioned
[1:26:41] it to them I said brother you made a
[1:26:43] statement
[1:26:45] yesterday and I said you know you said
[1:26:49] that brother Lee Vil's wife wrote the
[1:26:50] book I said brother Lee Vil is the one
[1:26:52] that wrote the church A's book not his
[1:26:54] wife right well I've been told that his
[1:26:57] wife wrote it I said his wife probably
[1:26:59] did type some of it out might have done
[1:27:02] that but she didn't write it right he
[1:27:04] said well all brother I can't
[1:27:06] read what he said and I'm I was honest
[1:27:08] you know and I I knew then why I didn't
[1:27:11] say something in front of everybody
[1:27:12] because I would have been belittling him
[1:27:15] and I knew I didn't want to do that but
[1:27:17] I said brother I said brother random
[1:27:21] okay to church hbook
[1:27:25] I said then it's okay to read it you
[1:27:28] know see because it's the word of
[1:27:32] God that's right that's it's the word of
[1:27:34] God the Bible is the word of God this
[1:27:36] message is the word of God but we've
[1:27:39] been talking about that we've got to go
[1:27:40] on to Perfection the new birth is
[1:27:44] wonderful but the new birth is like a
[1:27:46] baby born amen you don't want it to stay
[1:27:49] that way
[1:27:52] right you want it to grow up
[1:27:55] it's not made to stay that way so you
[1:27:58] feed it you help it you you take care of
[1:28:01] it see until one day it'll stand there
[1:28:05] in its own
[1:28:07] Perfection you know what and it can have
[1:28:09] children and you amen and all it'll
[1:28:13] produce that's all I tried to do about
[1:28:15] the word of God is to get you and I to
[1:28:17] take what we have but not cabbage down
[1:28:20] on it and just keep going on keep going
[1:28:22] on and keep going on
[1:28:25] right the things that all of the other I
[1:28:28] don't I didn't mean all okay the thing
[1:28:31] that most of the ministers do is they're
[1:28:34] scared of something got around preached
[1:28:37] oh amen cuz they're afraid to get it
[1:28:42] wrong I honor them for that that's a
[1:28:45] fine but
[1:28:47] somebody has got to break the message
[1:28:49] down to us cuz your Prophet when said
[1:28:51] that was what would take place he said
[1:28:53] to I Ministry take the message and break
[1:28:55] it down to the people now I didn't say
[1:28:57] that your Prophet said it we see people
[1:28:59] that won't even go to church they won't
[1:29:00] have nothing to do with a five-fold
[1:29:01] Ministry until they got a burial or a
[1:29:03] Baby dedicated then when they do my
[1:29:06] phone will ring they want me to go bury
[1:29:07] somebody or
[1:29:09] something and I found out here the other
[1:29:11] day you know that they they wound up in
[1:29:13] one place taking communion this brother
[1:29:15] has to come down and give them communion
[1:29:17] cuz tape recorder can't give you
[1:29:19] communion that's not a joke it's true
[1:29:22] that's right yeah but that's what we do
[1:29:25] see we don't believe in this but we got
[1:29:27] these little bitty quirks that we've got
[1:29:28] to go
[1:29:29] with and see yeah go we don't want to
[1:29:32] put on a tape at a funeral and just let
[1:29:34] it play you know and then go bury the
[1:29:35] body but now
[1:29:37] listen we have the perfect
[1:29:40] interpretation right and God Vindicated
[1:29:45] the prophet's message to be true amen
[1:29:48] all right but now let's take this life
[1:29:49] statement you know that brother brandham
[1:29:51] said the bride
[1:29:56] would vindicate come on Malachi 4 come
[1:30:00] on
[1:30:01] brother brother don't need Vindicated he
[1:30:03] look Vindicated see
[1:30:06] now you're the one that's to arguing
[1:30:08] with him not me amen R said the bride
[1:30:11] would vindicate Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[1:30:14] Revelation
[1:30:17] 10:7 now what does vindicate mean see we
[1:30:19] think vindicate means you got to raise
[1:30:21] the dead to heal the sick do no
[1:30:24] the Bride of Jesus Christ sure I believe
[1:30:27] that she will be doing that I believe in
[1:30:29] the bride of Christ around the world the
[1:30:30] dead is being raised the sick has been
[1:30:32] healed wonderful marvelous things are
[1:30:34] taking place around the world in the
[1:30:35] bride of Christ I believe that that
[1:30:37] right am but the main thing is to do
[1:30:40] what you want to do the works of
[1:30:44] God what is the works of
[1:30:49] God well he sit now what is the works of
[1:30:52] God right to believe them that he
[1:30:59] sins so we believe brother Brand's
[1:31:01] message
[1:31:04] right amen we believe his message was
[1:31:08] Vindicated but you see if it's not made
[1:31:10] manifest by somebody that's it amen you
[1:31:15] know then there won't be a Rapture right
[1:31:19] amen it may just be one person it
[1:31:22] doesn't matter if it's one 10 me that
[1:31:24] doesn't make any B of difference it's
[1:31:25] one
[1:31:26] person that has to do with the
[1:31:28] Vindication and still proves what he
[1:31:30] said the bride will vindicate right
[1:31:35] right well they got dealing the sick
[1:31:37] over here and they that's right cuz
[1:31:39] that's partial realization that's right
[1:31:41] it's still working it's partial
[1:31:43] realization but you know who's doing it
[1:31:45] if the sick's being healed God's doing
[1:31:47] it dead being raised God's doing right I
[1:31:50] don't care who's doing the other part of
[1:31:51] it right God has to be the one to heal a
[1:31:56] sick but you see let us go on in the
[1:32:00] message of the hour
[1:32:03] right well brother it's been 40 years
[1:32:07] okay maybe they give us maybe God will
[1:32:08] give us 40
[1:32:10] more you know what he'll give us 40 more
[1:32:12] if we need
[1:32:14] it right
[1:32:17] right cuz he promised
[1:32:20] it that's right he promised it
[1:32:25] you see back in those days years ago
[1:32:27] people were saying you
[1:32:29] know they used the
[1:32:32] quote as a
[1:32:35] u an ability to be able to uh show how
[1:32:39] smart they were but years ago the people
[1:32:42] would read the quote out of the Daniel
[1:32:45] 70
[1:32:47] weeks and they'd say if you don't
[1:32:50] understand the Daniel 70 weeks that's
[1:32:51] what brother BR says verbatim almost wor
[1:32:54] if you don't understand Daniel 7 which
[1:32:56] you can't understand the seals and those
[1:32:59] things then they turn around and see you
[1:33:02] understand Daniel 7 W is it three and a
[1:33:05] half or
[1:33:06] seven one brother said well just put it
[1:33:08] together it's three and a half and seven
[1:33:10] that makes 10 and a
[1:33:15] half but see people wouldn't try to
[1:33:18] preach Daniel 70 weeks right so thereby
[1:33:22] the seals became a taboo for them
[1:33:24] somebody to try to preach but you
[1:33:29] see God revealed a said to we amen
[1:33:33] that's right so we could understand
[1:33:35] that's right the
[1:33:38] seals amen so we can
[1:33:44] understand then he's revealed a lot of
[1:33:46] things from that time on
[1:33:49] right cuz we don't have to go back and
[1:33:51] change any of it right
[1:33:54] right what I believe there I believe
[1:33:57] today in
[1:34:00] 1969 in Athens Georgia I preached that
[1:34:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the
[1:34:07] son of
[1:34:08] man on the earth in the last day the
[1:34:11] revealed word right amen
[1:34:15] 1969 you know I still believe that amen
[1:34:19] amen you know that 69 how many that's 40
[1:34:22] something years M you know I still
[1:34:25] believe it you know why I believe it cuz
[1:34:28] it's
[1:34:32] true cuz I was reading what the prophet
[1:34:35] said and believing what he said it
[1:34:38] wasn't my idea I just like everybody
[1:34:41] else but when God reveals something to
[1:34:44] me I don't have no trouble challenge
[1:34:45] that's why we open up the internet it's
[1:34:47] out there I ain't challenging nobody to
[1:34:49] nothing I'm just telling you what I've
[1:34:51] left that's
[1:34:52] right you can take it do what you want
[1:34:55] to with it it's up to you you can
[1:34:57] ridicule it you can do anything you want
[1:34:58] to that's your
[1:35:00] problem right I just try to say what I
[1:35:02] say right and believe what I believe
[1:35:06] right but I am open internet or anywhere
[1:35:10] to anyone to come show me where I preach
[1:35:11] from
[1:35:13] amen now I don't mean a quote right you
[1:35:16] know except for me come on Brothers I
[1:35:19] don't mean like the other day when I was
[1:35:21] trying to make November and October the
[1:35:22] same month
[1:35:25] boy brother I got you well that's all
[1:35:28] right I'm not going off on nobody called
[1:35:30] you corrected me I'm just saying
[1:35:32] wouldn't that be something for me to get
[1:35:34] something off the internet to come back
[1:35:35] and say it was wrong War are wrong you
[1:35:39] said I told supposed to be
[1:35:43] November no get in the Bible right right
[1:35:46] show me where I'm off this word show me
[1:35:49] where I've ever taught anything that's
[1:35:51] not in this Bible right show me where
[1:35:53] I've never Tau what the prophet said
[1:35:55] that's
[1:35:56] right the 70 weeks the seals the
[1:35:59] marriage and divorce the one God the the
[1:36:03] things come and let's talk about it why
[1:36:06] cuz I want to go on to
[1:36:09] Perfection maybe you have what I have
[1:36:11] need of so let's go on to
[1:36:15] Perfection but let's don't forget these
[1:36:18] things that's what the people of the
[1:36:19] message there's a big doctrine of the
[1:36:21] people of the message like this that
[1:36:23] until'
[1:36:24] 62 brother Brandon was preaching but
[1:36:27] when the seals broken the
[1:36:29] things is a different message because
[1:36:32] this over here straightened all that out
[1:36:34] back there now show to show me where it
[1:36:40] did show me where it
[1:36:45] did the son of man come to straight and
[1:36:47] brother ran them
[1:36:50] out
[1:36:52] no that's right
[1:36:56] I
[1:36:57] thought that it didn't take the seals to
[1:36:59] make him
[1:37:02] right a
[1:37:04] prophet I thought he's born a
[1:37:08] prophet and being born the prophet he
[1:37:11] never believed in the
[1:37:14] Trinity because it was
[1:37:19] unscriptural but yet he had a Baptist
[1:37:21] Bible and converted them to a Baptist
[1:37:23] faith
[1:37:24] until God revealed amen he said one day
[1:37:26] I used to think Jesus loved me and God
[1:37:28] hated me he never believ in the
[1:37:31] Trinity when I proves he did no it
[1:37:34] didn't show you where he said let's
[1:37:36] stand together and address the third
[1:37:38] person of the
[1:37:40] Trinity that didn't mean he's trary
[1:37:43] right he's talking about your third
[1:37:46] person not his is cuz he didn't believe
[1:37:48] in
[1:37:49] one see that's where that all it takes
[1:37:52] is just simply let the Holy
[1:37:54] Spirit but let's go on in this
[1:38:00] message the way has been made for you
[1:38:03] and I to go
[1:38:04] on now I believe that I believe the way
[1:38:08] has been made I believe now he has
[1:38:12] permitted the word to come to the place
[1:38:15] right to where that we can walk off the
[1:38:17] earth in a rure amen I believe that amen
[1:38:23] I believe that's earnestly contending
[1:38:25] for the
[1:38:26] faith and I believe
[1:38:29] that there a lot of things maybe we
[1:38:31] don't understand how it goes together
[1:38:33] it's all
[1:38:35] right but God will reveal what we have
[1:38:38] need
[1:38:42] of but let's don't let this message
[1:38:44] become dead works or carnal reform right
[1:38:49] and just get down on the foundation and
[1:38:51] just play around let's go on
[1:38:55] you know that they took that old corner
[1:38:57] of the
[1:38:58] land and you know what they done with
[1:39:05] it
[1:39:07] right there wasn't enough corn in the
[1:39:09] land for them to live off of all the
[1:39:11] rest of the years they live
[1:39:13] there they ate the old corn of the land
[1:39:16] but then they took that and planted it
[1:39:20] amen
[1:39:21] amen hallelujah and you know what they
[1:39:24] received a crop off of
[1:39:28] that exactly what they put in the ground
[1:39:31] that they've been eating old corn so
[1:39:33] they never did quit eating old corn come
[1:39:37] on right
[1:39:41] Hallelujah they took the word of God
[1:39:44] Amen done what they're supposed to do
[1:39:46] with it down to the ages this word was
[1:39:49] planted into the
[1:39:51] ground and it's come back out amen and
[1:39:54] here now in full
[1:39:57] maturity for you and
