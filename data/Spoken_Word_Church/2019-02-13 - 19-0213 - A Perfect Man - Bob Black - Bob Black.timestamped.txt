[6:23] [Music]
[6:40] a man it's good to be in the house of
[6:44] the Lord and God bless you Saints let's
[6:47] turn over to Genesis chapter 37 and then
[6:50] we'll read from Genesis chapter 41 just
[6:57] see where the Lord leads us tonight the
[6:59] reason really what got me on this text
[7:01] was um you just get emotional you kind
[7:11] of start thinking about where the Lord's
[7:13] brought you from the journey that he's
[7:15] taking you own and and all the kind of
[7:18] hard things that have have happened in
[7:21] your life are kind of things that take
[7:24] place and so come on now but I want to
[7:39] take a little topic tonight of the takes
[7:41] of a perfect man because we know that
[7:44] brother Brian preached the statute of
[7:47] perfect man and all the sermons after
[7:48] that and really the whole message is to
[7:50] get us to a place where we're not just
[7:54] little babies wandering around wondering
[7:56] what we're here for
[7:57] then we have a knowledge of what the day
[7:59] in the hour that we're living in that we
[8:01] have understanding of what we're doing
[8:02] here that our purpose and then we're not
[8:04] just tossed around by every wind of
[8:06] doctrine and you know you just think
[8:10] about where you've come how you've come
[8:11] through you've seen all the strange
[8:13] doctrines and all the different things
[8:15] going around but yet God has kept you
[8:18] straight in the straight and narrow and
[8:20] begin to open up the word to you you
[8:23] know my we we've got a lot to be
[8:25] thankful for so let me take off my coat
[8:29] here let's read from Genesis chapter 37
[8:33] verses 1 to 4
[8:41] and Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his
[8:45] father was a stranger in the land of
[8:48] Canaan these are the generations of
[8:52] Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was
[8:55] feeding the flock with his brethren and
[8:57] the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and
[8:59] with the sons of Zilpah his father's
[9:01] wives and Joseph brought unto his father
[9:04] their evil report now Israel loved
[9:06] Joseph more than all his children
[9:08] because he was the son of his old age
[9:10] and he made him a coat of many colours
[9:12] and when his brethren saw that their
[9:14] father loved him more than all his
[9:15] brethren they hated him and could not
[9:17] speak peaceably under him now let's kind
[9:20] of go over to Genesis chapter 41 because
[9:24] we got about how he he was given a coat
[9:26] a robe and turned to verse 38 and and
[9:32] read to 42 and pharaoh said unto his
[9:35] servants can we find such a one as this
[9:37] is a man and whom the Spirit of God is
[9:40] and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much
[9:43] as God hath showed the all this there's
[9:45] none so discreet and wise as thou art
[9:49] thou shall be over my house and
[9:51] according unto that word shall all my
[9:53] people be ruled only in the throne will
[9:56] I be greater than now and Figaro said
[10:01] unto Joseph see I have set thee over all
[10:03] the land of Egypt and favorite took off
[10:06] his ring from his hand and put it upon
[10:08] Joseph's hand and arrayed him investors
[10:17] of fine linen and put a gold chain about
[10:20] his neck let's go to the Lord in prayer
[10:23] well God was so thankful today Lord
[10:26] Jesus to be a Christian
[10:27] Lord God we're so grateful to you to be
[10:30] able to gather together amongst fellow
[10:32] believers Lord Jesus that we're all
[10:34] growing in grace Lord Jesus toward us
[10:36] this finality to come to an adoption
[10:39] Lord where you look at us Lord Jesus and
[10:42] you say that man or that woman looks
[10:46] acts exhibits the exact same traits that
[10:49] I do and I'll set him up I'll put him on
[10:52] a crown
[10:53] I put him on a throne put a crown on him
[10:55] robe and give him a signet on his hand
[10:58] and set him on rulership God was so
[11:02] grateful Lord Jesus to have heard this
[11:04] message of this day Lord God to give us
[11:07] to give us this kind of faith this kind
[11:09] of a message Lord granted I pray Lord it
[11:12] tonight Lord Jesus won't just be it like
[11:14] any other church service Lord because I
[11:16] don't believe that tonight Lord we've
[11:17] come just to learn about things Lord but
[11:20] we've come to receive overcoming power
[11:22] and Lord we've heard a message we
[11:24] received a message to give us that Lord
[11:27] God grant that Lord Jesus said you'll
[11:29] open up ever as we open up the doors of
[11:32] our heart Lord Jesus that you'll feel
[11:33] welcome here Lord God that you'll come
[11:35] and abide with us and worship with us
[11:37] Lord Jesus but truly you've given us
[11:40] something to worship we Lord God to
[11:42] worship You Lord Jesus we ask your
[11:44] blessing upon the reading of your word
[11:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:47] amen
[11:51] you may be seated you know the first
[11:55] time I preached I forgot to tell
[11:56] everybody be seated we were coming up
[12:02] the road and we were talking about
[12:03] Monica was just tearing this story of
[12:05] this missionary named David Livingstone
[12:07] that the first time he preached he uh he
[12:10] he got so scared got so nervous he
[12:12] couldn't even finish the reading of the
[12:14] scripture and he ran off and just about
[12:16] destroyed his reputation but uh anyway
[12:19] you know God God takes us through trials
[12:22] and through through different things and
[12:24] everything and and and he's leaving us
[12:26] alone so what I want to talk about
[12:28] tonight is a perfect man and it you know
[12:31] to to get perfection it there's all
[12:35] these different little milestones along
[12:37] the road to perfection and and you know
[12:40] you think a perfectionist is really like
[12:42] climbing a mountain and you know what
[12:44] the Peter talked about how they accept
[12:47] accept you have these virtues you cannot
[12:49] see afar off you cannot see you cannot
[12:51] even really know what's going on unless
[12:53] you get climb up this mountain so you
[12:56] know brother Joe back there he's got
[12:59] this idea that that me and him and
[13:01] and maybe our kids when we go out with
[13:03] some time we can we'll go up hike Pikes
[13:06] Peak and climb up the mountain climb up
[13:08] this big high mountain that's in the I
[13:11] guess it's the highest in the east east
[13:13] eastern side of the high somewhere it's
[13:16] a big mountain and so you know when you
[13:20] begin to look at climbing the mountain
[13:22] you you begin to look at what's what's
[13:24] involved in that it's not something that
[13:27] you just go especially in this case you
[13:29] get up high and there's all the way to
[13:32] the top and there's less oxygen a whole
[13:34] lot less oxygen that there is down at
[13:36] the bottom and there's you know a lot of
[13:39] people especially the elderly and
[13:40] whatnot they get up to the top and they
[13:42] you know get fainting spells and
[13:44] headaches and start feeling miserable
[13:46] and all that kind of stuff so you don't
[13:48] want to approach it lightly you want to
[13:50] do your research you want to do your
[13:52] reading and make sure that you're
[13:53] prepared for that for the journey and
[13:56] you know brother Branham talked about
[13:57] how when you go when you start this
[13:59] journey this journey up up the statue of
[14:02] a perfect man what you need to do is you
[14:04] need to get a guide first because I like
[14:06] on a hunting trip or any kind of
[14:08] excursion like this where you you're not
[14:11] it's a place a way that you've never
[14:13] been before then you don't know where
[14:15] you're going you need somebody to be
[14:16] able to guide you and so you need you
[14:19] need the right equipment in other words
[14:21] and so they start on this to start on
[14:24] this journey you need to be equipped
[14:27] with the thing that will carry you
[14:29] through so I want to maybe kind of
[14:32] backtrack a little bit listen let's look
[14:33] backwards and remember how you were
[14:35] first born again and remember all the
[14:37] the challenges of all the struggles and
[14:40] things of you know you'd hear a preacher
[14:42] talking about anointed ones and maybe
[14:44] within your heart you would begin to
[14:45] question and mine anointed one do I have
[14:47] the real genuine thing the real genuine
[14:49] article and then you begin to dig deeper
[14:52] and find out what it really means to be
[14:53] a born-again Christian maybe tonight
[14:56] some of you were sitting here wondering
[14:58] if you were a real born-again Christian
[14:59] I you know it's kind of difficult to say
[15:01] things like that
[15:02] to put that out there but but brother
[15:05] Branham told us the truth of the message
[15:06] the truth of the gospel is that there is
[15:08] a mixed multitude and every assembly
[15:11] there's a true believer them
[15:12] believer in the unbeliever and you got
[15:14] all that that you're preaching to so
[15:16] maybe tonight something that there is
[15:18] say it might go out to your heart and
[15:20] you might kind of prick you and make you
[15:22] come to a realization that something's
[15:24] maybe something's not quite right and
[15:27] you know the the kind of the cornerstone
[15:31] or the central part the pivotal
[15:34] scripture of the whole Bible is Hebrews
[15:36] 4:12 that says for the word of God is
[15:39] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[15:42] two-edged sword and you know we can feel
[15:44] that any Christian that's been in church
[15:46] for long enough knows knows how how
[15:49] painful the Word of God can be sometimes
[15:51] as it strikes and begins to shape in
[15:54] that masterpiece off knocking the little
[15:55] pieces off that shouldn't be there that
[15:57] sword is striking and and what's it
[15:59] doing what it's doing is is its
[16:01] revealing what's really there because
[16:03] without their Scripture and and the
[16:06] Prophet to explain to us how would we
[16:07] know the difference between an anointed
[16:10] one and someone that's really got a word
[16:12] birth because it says now listen to this
[16:15] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[16:18] soul and spirit that there's a
[16:20] difference between the soul and the
[16:22] spirit there's a difference between
[16:24] those two you are you were made up of
[16:27] three different pieces you've got a body
[16:28] and a spirit and a soul and so the Word
[16:32] of God when it's preached it can discern
[16:35] it is a it says and of the joints and
[16:37] marrow the body and as a discerner of
[16:41] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[16:43] so in the world of God goes out and his
[16:45] priests preach from behind the pool pour
[16:47] that's that's why I believe that the
[16:49] preaching of the gospel is really the
[16:50] highest form of worship because the
[16:52] preaching of the gospel bursts people
[16:55] into the kingdom
[16:56] it causes lives to be changed it gives
[16:58] overcoming power it causes the sinner to
[17:01] realize that they're lost and then it
[17:02] gives them life so when the word of God
[17:04] goes out and it begins to it begins to
[17:08] have an effect on the individual and to
[17:10] really understand what kind of effect
[17:12] that has on the individual you have to
[17:13] take let's take a deeper look at what
[17:15] the individual is made of because you
[17:17] know we we go around and we we you know
[17:20] when we're driving a car we put our
[17:21] hands on the steering wheel and we turn
[17:23] to the left
[17:24] right and and we're thinking about where
[17:26] we're gonna go we're reasoning at work
[17:28] when I sit down at work and we have
[17:30] these meetings and things and and we
[17:32] talk about what the best thing to do
[17:33] whether to buy some software or not how
[17:36] to implement it how where to put the
[17:38] databases where to do all the different
[17:40] things and we're reasoning things and so
[17:42] you you begin to think just as a natural
[17:44] human being that that is where that is
[17:46] where the majority of your of your
[17:49] essence is that the majority of your
[17:52] your being is but that's not really the
[17:55] case your being is like an iceberg we're
[17:58] down under the water under the depths
[18:01] there most of the iceberg is that's the
[18:04] soul of the man the soul of the beans
[18:06] and that soul is wherever that soul
[18:09] leans that's the way that that man is
[18:11] going to go you know I began to read
[18:14] just kind of see what what psychologists
[18:17] have to say about the subconscious and
[18:19] the conscious and they say man if you if
[18:22] you look at if you hook a man up to
[18:23] electrodes and things they begin to see
[18:25] that the man he spends the majority of
[18:28] his time the majority of his thinking
[18:31] 95% of his of his of his existence is in
[18:35] that subconscious room something where
[18:38] you're not even aware of it when you're
[18:40] going about your daily tasks but yet
[18:42] that thing that you're not aware of that
[18:44] thing that's underneath the current
[18:46] underneath the water you so to speak is
[18:48] what's moving you what's driving you and
[18:50] that's that's what you know so many
[18:53] Christians today they sit in churches
[18:55] and they and they hear the gospel and
[18:57] they and they just kind of sit there and
[18:59] they're not feeding on it there they're
[19:01] just occupying a chair warming the chair
[19:05] that they're sitting in and they think
[19:06] that they're saved when really there's
[19:09] an anointing on them they feel good that
[19:11] get in the atmosphere they like the
[19:13] music they're like hearing a firey
[19:15] sermon they like hearing somebody jump
[19:17] up and down or it's watching this they
[19:18] like being in an atmosphere but yet
[19:20] there's something that's lacking in
[19:22] their soul and so when you see you've
[19:25] got to be equipped you got to be
[19:26] equipped with the right thing and I'm
[19:28] talking about you got to be equipped by
[19:30] a word birth when you hear the word it
[19:33] goes down into that heart that listen
[19:35] the only
[19:37] get your soles straighten up the oh
[19:39] there's only one way one Avenue to get
[19:42] that soul right and it's not by jumping
[19:45] up and down it's not even really it's
[19:47] not going by going through prayer lines
[19:49] it's not by by so much as people laying
[19:52] the hands on you or or getting real
[19:54] emotional but the only way to get faith
[19:56] faith that will change your soul is by
[19:59] the hearing of the word by the hearing
[20:01] of the gospel and I'm not talking about
[20:04] just just like learning like you're in
[20:06] school and whatnot but when you when you
[20:08] hear over the pulpit when you hear it
[20:11] preached that that Jesus Christ died for
[20:13] your sins that he paid it away that he
[20:15] paid the price for all of your iniquity
[20:17] all of you everything has already been
[20:19] paid for and you sit there and believe
[20:21] it and receive it when you hear that
[20:22] that if you want the new birth repent
[20:25] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[20:26] Jesus Christ it what his name is as
[20:28] Jesus Christ that name that was a
[20:30] mystery all down through the ages and is
[20:32] now revealed to you is now made plain
[20:34] and you sit and receive that into your
[20:37] soul it will change you it will change
[20:38] you and when you when you're conscious
[20:41] and your subconscious gets lined up with
[20:44] the world of God something's got to
[20:46] happen now I know maybe that's that
[20:51] maybe that's a little bit basic and
[20:53] everything maybe you say well we know
[20:55] how to get a new birth and everything
[20:56] but see this little principle that the
[20:59] subconscious in agreement with the
[21:01] conscious in agreement with God's Word
[21:03] will change your body see it will change
[21:06] your body as you feast upon the Word of
[21:09] God it is changing you from from from
[21:11] mortal to immortality of course now as
[21:16] we get into this you don't think I've
[21:18] gotten away from my my topic Joseph
[21:21] because as you get into this as you
[21:23] start going down this journey you might
[21:26] be like Joseph and looking around at all
[21:28] the circumstances thinking nothing's
[21:29] going on it looks like I'm in prison I'm
[21:32] in prison chains everything around me
[21:35] looks like nothing like nothing's
[21:36] happening
[21:37] but something's taking place sometimes
[21:40] you got to go through the sorrow and the
[21:41] pain and all the troubles and everything
[21:43] to get out on the other side and let me
[21:45] tell you when you come out the other
[21:46] side you talk about rejoicing
[21:48] when you come out when there's sorrow
[21:50] when a child is being born with but when
[21:52] the baby's comes forth all that's
[21:54] forgotten well one day we'll forget all
[21:56] the sorrow or like like Abraham did when
[21:58] he sat down with Melchizedek and he ate
[22:00] bread and wine after the battle was over
[22:02] after the battle and after the battles
[22:04] over we'll sit well around the
[22:06] circumference of the earth with Jesus
[22:07] and eat that communion with him because
[22:10] the battle will be over the battle will
[22:12] be conquered Nevada will be won
[22:14] sometimes it looks like nothing's taking
[22:18] place
[22:20] listen let's just dwell on this for a
[22:22] little bit about that subconscious and
[22:24] the cut and the cautious because that's
[22:26] that's so many people's problems today
[22:29] is a you know you think you'll think
[22:33] that that because you are around other
[22:37] believers that because you sit in a
[22:39] message church that you've reasoned it
[22:41] out and you you reason in your mind it
[22:44] seems reasonable it seems reasonable to
[22:46] do that to go to church and all these
[22:48] kind of things but but it's got to drop
[22:52] down a little deeper let's let's read
[22:54] number two the inside man see what the
[22:58] Prophet said about this he said why
[23:05] jesus said have faith in God is that
[23:07] right for verily verily I say unto you
[23:10] if you not if I if you shall say unto
[23:13] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[23:15] it
[23:16] it'll be it has to it has to do just
[23:19] what you say if you didn't doubt it now
[23:23] you believe it up here we're in your
[23:26] reasoning and your memory faculty and
[23:28] all that all that conscious level now
[23:31] let's get this subconscious believing it
[23:33] to and when the subconscious and this
[23:35] conscious in harmony with God then it'll
[23:39] happen so there's there's the nth Wow
[23:42] when I pray when I seek out for
[23:45] something when I'm calling out to God
[23:47] for my children when that gets lined up
[23:49] it will happen
[23:51] that's a listen that's that's the
[23:53] promise of God you we've got all these
[23:56] promises you know brother Graham talked
[23:57] about how that he gave us the immutable
[24:00] mutability of God that God cannot live
[24:02] to evidences that these promises are
[24:05] true that he cannot lie at the man a God
[24:08] that cannot lie that would promise you
[24:10] something and and if that man that a God
[24:12] that cannot lie would promise you
[24:14] something you got two proofs there then
[24:16] it's got to come to pass it cannot it
[24:18] can't falter a fail the promises of God
[24:21] are true as we read these quotes you'll
[24:26] find out that seeing it and you're in
[24:28] your conscious level in your conscious
[24:30] you can reason things out but down in
[24:32] that subconscious it doesn't reason
[24:35] that's a very important point
[24:37] it doesn't reason all it does is it just
[24:40] maybe very quietly says yes or no so in
[24:47] your conscious you're up there saying
[24:48] well I believe I believe I believe like
[24:50] brother Brennan will say people will
[24:51] come through the prayer line I believe
[24:52] that I'm going to be healed
[24:54] but down and that's subconscious so it
[24:56] would maybe hold his hand up and just
[24:57] say no no and now remember that message
[25:02] that y'all were just listening to
[25:03] perfect faith he said when perfect faith
[25:05] comes that subconscious is saying yes
[25:08] let's see how it seems it seems real
[25:11] simple but it just keeps building on up
[25:14] it just this is how we're going to take
[25:17] a body change by that subconscious being
[25:20] an agreement with the conscious which is
[25:22] an agreement with the Word of God
[25:26] the brother brother said this spirit and
[25:29] the bride say come the spirit and the
[25:31] Prophet are in agreement with the bride
[25:34] and they're all in agreement they're all
[25:35] saying the same thing when they're all
[25:38] saying the same thing something has got
[25:39] to happen
[25:41] let's read number three expectation now
[25:45] you say I've got faith the first thing
[25:49] you have to have a base for faith that's
[25:52] God's Word right this is the day when
[25:54] people have a base for all sorts of
[25:56] things that they believe but they don't
[25:58] even base it in sound sense they don't
[26:00] base it in anything if somebody were to
[26:02] ask what why do you believe such a such
[26:04] a thing will they just seem like a good
[26:06] idea but praise God we've got a Bible to
[26:09] base everything on
[26:11] and brother branham said this this is
[26:13] God and printed form you take God and
[26:16] print him that's what that's a quote
[26:18] print him on the pages and this is what
[26:20] you got so when you read this it becomes
[26:22] not pretty anymore but a living reality
[26:28] that you can base your word on you can
[26:31] base you can base your faith on this
[26:34] this is what we base our base our faith
[26:36] on come on Bob let's keep reading
[26:39] well then the man goes to school and he
[26:42] learns theology he reads it said God
[26:45] said so yes I believe that I believe
[26:48] that he's got a good theological
[26:50] education but does he really believe it
[26:53] he believes that here in his mind see
[26:56] but he's got a subconscious also and
[26:58] that subconscious disagrees with this
[27:00] because when he starts to do it he's a
[27:02] little bit scared it won't happen and it
[27:04] won't that's right oh brother and sister
[27:08] when perfect faith comes you won't be
[27:09] scared to take a body change everything
[27:13] will be lined up just right let's read
[27:16] number 4 he said in faith 1956 he said
[27:20] do you believe that ladies sitting right
[27:22] there yes had more faith than you
[27:23] thought you had see see she didn't in
[27:26] her conscious maybe she was kind of
[27:28] thinking I don't you know I don't feel
[27:30] anything I don't I don't see a pillar of
[27:33] fire or anything but yet something down
[27:36] in her subconscious was working she had
[27:39] faith and didn't even realize it faith
[27:41] it's a subconscious thing lady faith is
[27:44] not a mental act see is something that
[27:46] you subconsciously do it let's dwell on
[27:50] that first just a second let's roll that
[27:51] around faith is not a mental act you
[27:54] can't get faith by just by just thinking
[27:56] real hard or struggling real hard or
[27:59] trying to pray a good great big old
[28:01] prayer or anything or working yourself
[28:04] up
[28:04] none of that creates faith faith only
[28:07] comes by the word and you see that's
[28:09] what people struggle with so much well
[28:11] why should as soon as people start
[28:14] struggling with things that are that are
[28:15] caused by a problem in the subconscious
[28:18] what do they do they start leaving
[28:19] Church they start leaving the place
[28:21] where the word
[28:22] is preached over the pulpit any problems
[28:25] with the subconscious you need to you
[28:27] need to dig into that word more than
[28:28] ever that's when you should hang on
[28:31] let's keep reading it's something that
[28:34] you subconsciously do it people try to
[28:35] look to their intellects for faith when
[28:37] faith doesn't lay in here reasons lay
[28:39] here faith lays in the soul now the
[28:42] trouble with your foot and leg you
[28:44] believe that Jesus Christ make you well
[28:45] you do and it keeps going on talking to
[28:48] her about faith because faith lies is
[28:52] something working way down on the
[28:55] insider and the reason I'm kind of
[28:56] dwelling on this is because we've got
[28:58] you cannot take this journey up this
[29:00] mountain like I was talking about that
[29:02] journey that we want to take out west if
[29:04] we go out where Lord willing you can't
[29:07] go up that mountain if you're not
[29:09] equipped for the journey
[29:10] you can't take this journey up this
[29:13] mountain if you're not equipped make
[29:15] sure you're equipped before you start
[29:17] the journey why why is it so important
[29:19] to make sure you're equipped well one
[29:21] reason is because this journey is rough
[29:23] when all the persecutions set in or all
[29:26] the things all that all the trials and
[29:28] things of life listen to now is getting
[29:31] it's getting close to where you get
[29:33] you're starting to see the effects of
[29:35] the squeeze we're talking I was
[29:37] listening to people talking about in
[29:38] Africa how they're starting to to
[29:40] catalog all the churches if you're a
[29:42] message church you've got a phone into
[29:43] the government now all around the world
[29:45] things like this are starting to take
[29:47] place but before there can be a general
[29:49] squeeze there's got to be an individual
[29:51] squeeze you've got to have that
[29:52] individual squeeze in your life first to
[29:55] make sure that that you got to go
[29:57] through that wine press that that press
[29:59] where all that all the goodness is
[30:00] squeezed out all the fruit can be made
[30:02] manifest all of that stuff you've got to
[30:04] go through that first and two before but
[30:07] don't don't attempt to do that without
[30:09] being equipped with something on the
[30:11] inside that can pressurize you to
[30:13] withstand the things that are coming
[30:15] from the outside I mean you know think
[30:18] about all the all the ones that have
[30:20] have seemingly been in the message for
[30:23] years and years and as soon as people
[30:25] start posting things online believe the
[30:27] sign or whatever all the different
[30:29] things that have come up about well I
[30:31] don't know if the how many people fell
[30:33] off the bridge please
[30:34] come on what's that got to do with my
[30:36] salvation how many people fell off the
[30:39] bridge and just making up concoction
[30:40] things but yet they don't have something
[30:42] on the inside to pressurize themselves
[30:44] so they can fly high with the Eagles and
[30:46] so they fall apart I got I got tons of
[30:54] quotes here trying to see what I can
[30:56] look at I can kind of skip over save
[30:58] time we got here yeah I don't get
[31:09] nervous it's okay so we're talking about
[31:15] let me switch back to the story of
[31:17] Joseph here because the story of Joseph
[31:20] begins begins with him getting a coat of
[31:23] many colors and brother branham said
[31:25] that compare that type that was a type
[31:27] of that that robe that goes on the
[31:29] believer to prepare them for the journey
[31:32] those are my words prepare and prepare
[31:34] them for the journey but it's a type of
[31:36] the type of the Holy Spirit a type of
[31:38] the Holy the Holy Ghost what is the
[31:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost when the
[31:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:43] when when you receive the baptism of the
[31:46] Holy Ghost in your soul it's not just a
[31:49] feeling or sensation but it's the
[31:52] revelation of Jesus Christ down in your
[31:55] soul and that soul when when the
[31:57] revelation comes it'll produce a
[31:59] reaction a lot of times now the reaction
[32:02] might be different in different people
[32:04] that's what makes it so hard to express
[32:05] one person gets the revelation and they
[32:07] begin to cry and weep one person who
[32:09] gets the revelation and they begin to
[32:11] run around the building one person gets
[32:13] a revelation and they just begin to
[32:14] throw up their hands and rejoice but
[32:16] it's all the same thing different it's
[32:19] the concept between all the different
[32:21] individuals is that it's a revelation of
[32:24] Jesus Christ and it will have a
[32:26] different it will have it will cause
[32:27] emotions cause different things and
[32:29] different people different ones but the
[32:31] constant is that it's a revelation and
[32:34] so Joseph will say he got a revelation
[32:36] of who Jesus Christ was he got it from
[32:39] his father because the father is the one
[32:40] that gave him that Road when he compared
[32:42] him for the journey of course Joseph
[32:44] didn't know he
[32:45] wasn't quite aware that he was fixing
[32:47] the girl on a journey but you see
[32:49] quickly as soon as he begins to go on
[32:51] this journey he gets thrown into a pit I
[32:57] wanted to get thrown in a pit because of
[32:59] the revelation he had that's the same
[33:00] reason that that cane came through you
[33:03] know slew Abel the same reason that that
[33:06] Judas got upset with Jesus all the all
[33:10] down through the scripture the the ones
[33:12] with the true revelation have always
[33:14] been persecuted but I just want to kind
[33:18] of let's look at uh let's look at this
[33:21] scripture for a second Genesis 37 23 to
[33:24] 24 they cast him they took him and they
[33:28] cast him into a pit and the pit was
[33:30] empty and there was no water in him and
[33:34] Joseph being spiritually hated because
[33:37] of his revelation you see kind of maybe
[33:40] maybe step back and imagine Joseph in
[33:43] this situation spiritually that he's and
[33:45] he's now a little babe let's say let's
[33:47] put it over in the New Testament because
[33:49] we know in the Old Testament they did
[33:51] not have the new birth and so that God
[33:53] did not dwell down in their soul but
[33:55] over in the New Testament place him over
[33:57] here he's now a little babe in Christ
[33:58] and so you know God God did not
[34:03] predestinate us to remain little babies
[34:06] you were not where's that in the
[34:08] scripture Ephesians 1:5 says having
[34:10] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[34:12] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[34:14] according to the good pleasure of his
[34:15] will the good pleasure of his will is
[34:17] not for you to remain a little baby
[34:19] tossed around tossed about by every wind
[34:21] of doctrine wondering what's right
[34:22] wondering what's true being somebody
[34:25] that easily offended everything every
[34:27] time somebody wrongs you it just bruises
[34:29] you so easily but he's he's
[34:31] predestinated us to be called called to
[34:33] a higher place too hot called to a
[34:35] higher walk call to adoption but the
[34:38] path to get to that is sometimes fraught
[34:40] with danger and peril and all these
[34:42] things God God God called us to be a
[34:45] perfect man of course what stumbles us a
[34:48] lot of times is we think if I come to I
[34:50] can't come to church I can't get around
[34:51] those people because everybody there is
[34:53] perfect what makes us perfect it's not
[34:56] not the
[34:57] not that's trying to do it what makes us
[34:59] perfect is the holy God that lives
[35:02] inside of us because we've we've heard
[35:03] the word that's what makes it churches
[35:06] the place as a place it's the best place
[35:08] for the imperfect to go churches for the
[35:11] imperfect cuz you've got everybody
[35:13] starts off in perfect one time or
[35:15] another you start off a sinner we were
[35:17] born and seeing shapen in iniquity a
[35:19] spouse from my mother's womb speaking
[35:21] lies coming in the world coming in the
[35:23] world Rome and we needed to be made
[35:25] right and so you look at look at this
[35:28] whole journey the whole journey of
[35:30] Joseph typifies the journey of a
[35:32] believer and brother Graham said Joseph
[35:35] represented perfection he took talking
[35:38] about how you know Abraham represent
[35:40] election Isaac represented calling Jacob
[35:43] grace and then Joseph perfection and
[35:45] then he compared that to the to the last
[35:47] four Luther Wesley Pentecost and then
[35:51] coming up into the message of the our
[35:53] perfection why because the word that
[35:55] we've heard will make us perfect like
[35:57] Joseph was a perfect people with a
[36:00] perfect word a perfect faith that's what
[36:03] brother brand preached those things a
[36:04] statue of a perfect man with perfect
[36:07] faith but see God God knows exactly how
[36:11] to raise up children he doesn't you know
[36:16] Joseph he got that robe put on him by
[36:19] his earthly father he got the robe laid
[36:22] on his shoulders and and you think well
[36:24] maybe maybe Joseph kind of started
[36:27] getting in his head that now he's gonna
[36:29] he began to have dreams and spiritual
[36:31] things happening to him maybe maybe just
[36:33] in his natural mind he began to think
[36:35] well maybe I am better than these other
[36:37] ones maybe there's something a little
[36:38] makes me a little bit better and you
[36:40] know there is something special about
[36:42] the believers you're elected God has got
[36:44] us got his eye on you he gives you an
[36:47] angel when you're born but but what
[36:49] makes you special is not not the things
[36:51] that you do it's not it's not that we're
[36:54] better than anyone else it's the word
[36:56] that we've heard that makes us special
[36:57] and so so you see he began to maybe just
[37:02] just kind of dramatize a little bit
[37:03] maybe began to think some thoughts like
[37:05] that and and then God had to kind of let
[37:08] him go through a little a few little
[37:09] trials and things
[37:11] to press out to expose that the virtues
[37:14] to expose a real perfect man why because
[37:19] you've got to have character to reign
[37:22] you know brother ain't even talked about
[37:24] how that God took a picture of you
[37:25] before the foundation of the world and
[37:27] and that picture of you that that he saw
[37:30] kind of like Joseph at the end of this
[37:32] journey he's got a picture of you that
[37:34] he saw and the picture of you is not of
[37:37] you as a little baby and as none of you
[37:39] as the old man it's a picture of you at
[37:41] the prime of your life in perfection
[37:43] with perfect teeth and perfect hair and
[37:46] perfect all everything just perfect
[37:48] because that's its picture of you and
[37:51] that's what we're walking into
[37:52] but now I want to stress it this part of
[37:55] Joseph sure nough that that the picture
[37:58] that was in God's mind was not of a
[38:01] little baby not of a little bit we got
[38:04] this picture of Jesus sometimes as
[38:06] leaving him still in the manger crying a
[38:09] little baby but he grew up and was a man
[38:11] that preached and talked and spoken and
[38:14] and causes the fig tree to stop bearing
[38:16] fruit and I did all these things walked
[38:19] on water as a man your journey your the
[38:22] end of your journey is not just to be a
[38:24] little baby yes see God wants us to not
[38:35] not crawl around on her on all for so to
[38:37] speak not you know suck it a little Pasi
[38:40] but he wants us in that the journey of
[38:43] the the story and that they're in a
[38:44] zekiel I believe this is equal 36 or 37
[38:47] of the the dry bones that they began as
[38:52] the word began to be spoken to them they
[38:54] one thing led to another until finally
[38:57] at the end they were standing up
[38:58] standing up and believed in perfect
[39:02] faith able to walk and God doesn't want
[39:04] us to just crawl around wondering cry
[39:06] and what's going on he wants us to stand
[39:08] up on her own two feet you know that
[39:11] really the reason I began to kind of
[39:13] dwell on this is because you know was
[39:15] that he started he started school this
[39:17] year and when he got over there at the
[39:19] school he began to talk about all the a
[39:21] lot of the other students they had
[39:23] parents with them shadowing over them
[39:25] just kind of like in other words they
[39:27] didn't they couldn't stand on their own
[39:28] two feet they had to have their parent
[39:30] there to click the mouse for them and
[39:32] sign up for their classes and do all
[39:33] that kind of stuff I remember when I
[39:35] dropped him off for the standardized
[39:37] testing and everything we we're all
[39:38] sitting there in the car watching all
[39:40] the students walk in and and there was
[39:42] one student that had their mama with him
[39:44] carried in the lunch bag with him you
[39:46] see you see that even in the natural
[39:48] that looks odd that looks odd for
[39:50] somebody to be kind of relying on their
[39:52] mama to bring a lunch bag with them and
[39:54] walking in there going into the test
[39:55] none of the other students had their
[39:56] mama with them but their mama's going
[39:58] with them to make sure they get to the
[39:59] right place and do the right thing and
[40:01] all that kind of stuff now in the
[40:02] spiritual you say you're supposed to
[40:04] stand on your own two feet yeah let me
[40:07] get to preacher now you're supposed to
[40:09] be you're supposed to have your own your
[40:11] own relationship with Jesus Christ
[40:13] you're not supposed to be growling
[40:15] around wondering wondering you know it
[40:17] seems like so many today they they rely
[40:19] so much on the pastor or on the Deacons
[40:22] or on somebody else to have the
[40:23] relationship with God for on their
[40:25] behalf so that they don't have to work
[40:27] they don't have to go through all the
[40:28] trials maybe that Josephina they do they
[40:30] don't wanna have to endure all that
[40:31] stuff let somebody else go to people's
[40:33] houses let somebody else do all the
[40:35] praying let somebody else do all the
[40:37] struggling and everything let somebody
[40:38] else do all the worrying about whether
[40:40] there's something really going on if
[40:42] God's really doing something in the
[40:43] people's lives let somebody else do that
[40:46] but God wants you to stand on your own
[40:47] two feet on your own two feet so you
[40:50] know you won't be a little baby you know
[40:53] today today is and then even in the
[40:56] natural but even in the realm that's not
[40:58] spiritual everything's everybody's so
[41:00] concerned with with not being offended
[41:03] with not everything having everything
[41:04] just just right and you think think
[41:06] about that situation that that Joseph
[41:09] was in where he put that he got that
[41:11] road put on him and now he's in danger
[41:13] of being like a little delay out of
[41:15] seeing snowflake y'all know what a
[41:17] layout I see the snowflake is a layout
[41:19] of seeing the snowflake is where they
[41:21] say it snow for every snowflake is
[41:23] unique every single snowflake is special
[41:25] and so every single snowflake needs
[41:27] special treatment
[41:28] every single spray and by special
[41:30] treatment they mean well I've got a
[41:32] right to this I've got a right to do
[41:34] whatever I
[41:35] I've got a right to not be offended I've
[41:37] got to write in some of the Saks classes
[41:39] we were astounded in fact this wasn't
[41:41] the case when I went to school but now
[41:43] when you start class on the first on the
[41:45] very first day just so nobody is
[41:47] offended they ask what kind of pronoun
[41:49] would you like to be referred to pronoun
[41:52] what kind of pronoun would you like to
[41:54] be referred to now you know on the west
[41:55] coast now they're saying that there are
[41:57] 16 different pronouns that you have a
[41:59] right to be referred to and you're in
[42:01] your in your school or else they can
[42:03] take you away from your parents or just
[42:05] starting all this kind of stuff
[42:07] snowflakes snow but God is not raising
[42:09] us up to be a little snowflakes where we
[42:11] can't be touched we can't be offended
[42:13] well we think we've got a you don't have
[42:15] a single right coming you don't have a
[42:18] right to yourself at the end of the
[42:20] store we'll find out that Joseph was
[42:22] chained by shackles to the world he was
[42:25] he was willing to do sacrifice
[42:27] everything in his life to see the Word
[42:30] of God fulfilled and so that's maybe my
[42:33] message tinnitus you know you think you
[42:35] think you've got that you're put on here
[42:37] on earth to be a mechanic or to be a
[42:40] teacher or to be maybe a computer
[42:42] analyst or whatever but your job that's
[42:44] not your job or here on earth that's not
[42:47] your role your role is to fulfill the
[42:49] Word of God to see the Word of God
[42:51] fulfilled in your life and to see that
[42:54] word of God fulfilled you've got to grow
[42:56] into the stature of a perfect man not
[42:59] somebody that just feels like they need
[43:00] special treatment not somebody that
[43:03] feels like they can't have somebody
[43:04] disagree with them my my you think think
[43:08] about in this message with all the
[43:10] different disagreements over the years
[43:12] if people got so offended every time
[43:14] somebody disagreed with them where would
[43:15] we be but it's a growth process it's God
[43:19] bringing us into the full stature of a
[43:21] perfect man it's just somebody that's
[43:23] that has authority that has speaking
[43:26] conditioners somebody that grows up into
[43:28] the third pool and you know the third
[43:29] pool comes there's a lot of different
[43:31] things that come with the third pool you
[43:33] want to talk about the third pool it's
[43:34] the opening of the word to but it's also
[43:36] speaking conditions and it's also
[43:38] preaching to the Lost and there's a lot
[43:40] of things that go with that so if you
[43:42] want to get into the third pool you've
[43:44] got to get into the word
[43:45] that you not be tossed about by every
[43:47] wind of doctrine be a little baby and
[43:48] all those kind of things yeah you're
[43:56] right I do need something it's time to
[43:58] that's the top of the hour that's time
[44:00] to drink some more you know I think let
[44:07] me use Monica's family as an example
[44:10] because her she her parents raised up 13
[44:12] children which is quite a feat so I kind
[44:14] of look sometimes look to them to see
[44:16] you know how they how they raised up
[44:18] their children when when they're a lot
[44:21] of Monica's brothers when they when as
[44:22] they began to get older they didn't that
[44:24] they sent them off to the bank they
[44:26] wouldn't go with them and like have you
[44:27] know had the back of their neck come on
[44:29] we're going to the bank they take them
[44:30] to the they'd sent them off to the bank
[44:32] you talk to the teller you do all the
[44:33] stuff you transfer the money you do all
[44:35] you do all this kind of stuff you talk
[44:38] on the phone you do all this guys that
[44:39] why because they didn't want him to beat
[44:41] this little sniffling layout of seeing
[44:43] snowflakes they wanted to be raised up
[44:45] so that one day they could stand on
[44:47] their own two feet even in the natural
[44:49] that's that's a goodly thing but in the
[44:51] spiritual that's what God wants us to be
[44:53] he wants us to come up to where we're
[44:55] not we don't have to turn run around and
[44:57] where's mama well or worse
[45:00] where's where's my spiritual daddy where
[45:02] well when that when the time comes when
[45:05] you need something do you need to go
[45:07] find the pastor or can you listen one
[45:10] day one day you might get to the place
[45:12] where when the doors are closed we might
[45:15] all be dispersed or something and you
[45:17] won't be able to run to a prayer line
[45:18] you won't be able to run and fast and
[45:21] pray and do all these kind of stuff
[45:22] because you got to be standing on your
[45:24] own two feet but I believe that's what
[45:26] the preaching of the gospel here at this
[45:27] church has been preparing us for maybe
[45:29] some time has been rough maybe it's been
[45:31] hard but it's preparing us to stand on
[45:33] our own two feet so that when the time
[45:35] comes maybe you can speak some food on
[45:38] your table for yourself maybe you can
[45:40] speak something to speak a condition
[45:41] listen it's not normal for people to go
[45:44] around and not be able to speak to a
[45:47] mountain and move it it's not normal to
[45:49] not be able to speak to the winds and
[45:52] the waves and cause it to cease when I
[45:55] Adam was in the Garden of Eden he could
[45:56] speaking and calm things that
[45:59] said things bring peace to the earth and
[46:02] that's what the normally is that's what
[46:05] the Word of God is bringing us back into
[46:07] an equilibrium where that is normal that
[46:09] will be normal it's not normal you say
[46:12] well I need to rely on somebody else to
[46:14] do the speaking it's about past time to
[46:17] rely on somebody else we need to get the
[46:19] plate to a place where we can stand on
[46:21] our own when you see to get to that
[46:26] place Joseph had to go through some
[46:29] trials they threw him in the pit what
[46:30] about brother Branham you have a devil
[46:33] on you and he went down in that cave and
[46:34] he said I'm staying here until I figure
[46:36] out what's going on and then he met an
[46:37] angel wouldn't would he have met the
[46:39] angel made probably if he hadn't gone
[46:42] into that cave and we've had and got
[46:44] squeezed a little bit you've got a devil
[46:45] he was wondering whether he had a devil
[46:47] or not
[46:48] I wonder tonight if maybe some of us
[46:50] should get serious about whether we're
[46:52] just an anointed one or not whether
[46:53] there's the work we've had a real word
[46:55] birth get serious and get serious with
[46:57] God and don't check it out and find out
[46:59] cuz you've got to you've got to go
[47:01] through those times you've got to go
[47:03] through those places God God will
[47:05] squeeze you there's got to be an
[47:08] individual squeeze before there's a
[47:10] general squeeze you see that talk about
[47:16] Jase Jacob wrestling with the angel
[47:18] listen if you have a wrestled with the
[47:20] angel then you don't need somebody to
[47:23] explain what wrestling with the angel is
[47:25] wrestling wrestling with the angel you
[47:28] know when you come into the message you
[47:30] begin to wonder you begin to wrestle
[47:31] whatever doctrine that you heard every
[47:33] scripture what do you mean I should be
[47:35] baptized like that what do you mean
[47:36] there's not a Trinity what do you mean
[47:38] all this kind of stuff and you began to
[47:39] wrestle it and when you wrestled you you
[47:42] wrestle by turning pages you open up the
[47:44] pages of your Bible and the patients are
[47:46] the message books that have been given
[47:47] to you and you start turning pages you
[47:49] get on your knees and you wrestle and
[47:51] you come out on the other side like like
[47:54] Jacob did after he wrestled with the
[47:55] angel you never walk the same after
[47:58] you've wrestled with the angel you don't
[47:59] walk the same anymore
[48:00] because you've been delivered you've
[48:02] come through you've come through a
[48:04] process where something has been birthed
[48:07] in you and listen the bride is coming
[48:09] through a process now where the son of
[48:11] man is
[48:11] birth its producing its producing the
[48:14] word made flesh the word and I'm not
[48:17] saying that's something coming I'm
[48:19] saying it's right here it's already here
[48:22] it's listen I believe that even in this
[48:24] church even in there is assembly there's
[48:26] there's ones at all different levels but
[48:28] there's somebody here that's it that's
[48:30] sitting in adoption
[48:31] there's somebody here there's got to be
[48:33] somebody here they're sitting in
[48:34] adoption there's somebody here that said
[48:36] he ever ever stains or somebody here
[48:38] that's just being born in maybe but
[48:40] listen I don't believe it's far off I
[48:42] don't believe we're looking for
[48:43] something to come way down the road I
[48:45] believe that the Word of God is in flesh
[48:47] right here right now because the
[48:52] scripture says it is let's let's keep
[49:03] reading I've got these different stages
[49:10] in my nose look you got a UK how could
[49:15] Joseph come to that throne without
[49:17] character if he came to that throne he
[49:20] would be like a lot of maybe politicians
[49:22] today that are in leadership positions
[49:24] but they have no true character and so
[49:27] there a lot of big talking and
[49:28] everything but one wrong move and a
[49:30] button gets pressed and a bomb gets
[49:32] dropped because there's no character no
[49:34] character but but power without
[49:36] character is satanic
[49:37] but character in power Oh oh my I think
[49:41] what that would be that would be
[49:42] somebody like Joseph where they they
[49:44] couldn't can even point a finger at him
[49:46] and find one flaw and this kind of
[49:49] character does not come by trying to be
[49:52] good this kind of character only comes
[49:55] by the word because this kind of
[49:56] character is the word made flesh this
[49:59] kind of character is God in you remember
[50:03] brother Brown talked about how that when
[50:04] you go beyond the curtain of time when
[50:06] you step over there the only thing
[50:09] you're going to take with you is your
[50:11] character now you can either take the
[50:13] character of this world of this legacy
[50:15] and age or you can take the character of
[50:16] God that he is he's after he's been
[50:19] birthed into you let's kind of let's
[50:23] take a step back and look at
[50:25] look at this this whole story of Joseph
[50:28] because you know ministers preach in
[50:29] different ways and I kind of preached
[50:32] from like a big landscape view I know
[50:34] I'm just painting a picture where or you
[50:37] can kind of see the whole thing
[50:38] and but you know you can see in the life
[50:43] of Joseph you can see the entire journey
[50:46] of Jesus Christ you can see the entire
[50:49] journey of a Christian and because you
[50:53] can see the entire journey of all the
[50:55] seven church ages in the life of G of
[50:58] Joseph because his life types out every
[51:02] feast all the seven feasts let me just
[51:06] go through that real quick
[51:07] old brother Bob don't get Teddy calling
[51:10] us cuz listen the seventh you'll know
[51:17] that right the seven feasts type type
[51:19] the journey type the whole journey of
[51:22] the Christian experience from Passover
[51:23] all the way over to the feast of
[51:25] tabernacles a feast of Passover and the
[51:27] feast of unleavened bread or typed in
[51:29] his when he went down into the prison
[51:31] and on one side of Jesus was the was one
[51:35] that was one thing that went into
[51:37] paradise on the other was one that that
[51:39] lost eternal life there was two theis on
[51:42] either side of him and just like Joseph
[51:44] down there and that in that prison when
[51:46] he got thrown into the prison for you
[51:50] know they light up part of his wife lied
[51:51] on him and said all those things all one
[51:54] side was the butler and on one side was
[51:56] the Baker and and one got restored and
[52:00] the other got his head cut off so let's
[52:04] keep going on this the next feast is the
[52:06] feast of firstfruits because when Joseph
[52:08] came out of that he it's just like Jesus
[52:11] being risen he came out of that out of
[52:14] that prison out of that thing and he and
[52:16] he was put into after after the Pharaoh
[52:19] began to talk to him and and heard about
[52:21] how he could interpret dreams just like
[52:24] how the bride today can has an
[52:26] understanding of the word of the hour
[52:27] and the day that we're living in and
[52:29] just like Jesus had an understanding of
[52:32] who he was who what the son of man was
[52:34] and all those things and so Jesus Jesus
[52:38] rose from the
[52:39] even on the feast of firstfruits and
[52:41] Joseph rose from the prison on the feast
[52:43] of firstfruits we'll say it like that
[52:45] and then and then Passover where what
[52:51] does what happens on the feast of
[52:53] Passover
[52:54] God he pours out his spirit and begins
[52:57] to call to him a bride which is the same
[53:01] thing that Joseph did he began to he got
[53:04] a Gentile bride and drew her to him and
[53:06] and meanwhile the feast of the trumpets
[53:08] begins to unfold because the features of
[53:10] the trumpets because to call the 144,000
[53:13] back to their homeland draw them back
[53:15] and so that on the day of the feast of
[53:18] atonement they recognize who he is and
[53:21] recognize that he's the one that they
[53:22] killed and that's the same thing that
[53:24] played out in Joseph's life that the
[53:26] Jacob and all of his brethren they were
[53:29] turned back and they went through all
[53:30] the process of getting Benjamin and
[53:32] finally Benjamin came and then they
[53:34] recognized who Joseph was and then we've
[53:37] got the Feast of Tabernacles because
[53:39] after all this was done all of them came
[53:41] and they lived there they lived there in
[53:43] in the Millennium we'll say in the
[53:45] Millennium there they lived there and
[53:47] peace down in Egypt because the whole
[53:52] the whole life of Joseph types this
[53:55] process that's going on and see God has
[53:58] taken us through a process - and what
[54:01] he's doing is as you go through this
[54:04] journey he's got to test you to see if
[54:07] there's any lease will say any leaky
[54:10] spots to make sure that all of these
[54:12] virtues all of these things are packed
[54:16] in there real good and you can't shake
[54:18] the boxcar around see you see maybe when
[54:25] when Joseph began his journey at faith
[54:27] and he was given that that road you
[54:29] could say that was faith because he
[54:31] that's when you start your journey at
[54:33] faith the same Road maybe will say like
[54:37] this to say when you get a robe with
[54:40] Elijah Elisha got a robe
[54:42] it was the same robe that Elijah wore
[54:44] that road was given to him you get the
[54:48] same the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:50] the same power
[54:52] see he kept on going he then he went
[54:54] into into Potiphar's house and the Bible
[54:57] says that Potiphar looked up to him and
[54:59] and he demonstrated virtue and strength
[55:01] because out of him was flowing that
[55:03] grace that God to him God gave him you
[55:05] know brother Owen said virtue was a pass
[55:07] for it to pass out and so there Potiphar
[55:09] looked on him with you know admiration
[55:12] where is all this coming from and he set
[55:14] him over the whole house so that when
[55:16] Potiphar's wife came to him and began to
[55:18] accuse him he said look I can't I can't
[55:22] get involved with you here your husband
[55:24] has set me over things that in his house
[55:27] that he's not even aware of because he
[55:29] respects me he trusts me so much and you
[55:32] see virtue is when somebody is when
[55:34] somebody looks at that life and they
[55:35] know that there's a real Christian
[55:37] living that life because it's like that
[55:39] it's like a locomotive that that sermon
[55:41] our preach to remember that worth it
[55:42] once the fire gets burning in the boiler
[55:44] and the sting is moving the virtue
[55:47] powers the wheels because the virtue was
[55:50] the power they gets the train moving it
[55:52] gets it moving and you keep on going
[55:54] then then Joseph got thrown it down into
[55:58] the prison and he he revealed to the
[56:01] baker and the butler what their dreams
[56:03] were and he said maybe within himself he
[56:05] said remember me when you go back to the
[56:09] to Pharaoh remember me but then he had
[56:12] to stay down there two more years you
[56:14] know brother Graham taught us patience
[56:15] is patience with God waiting and
[56:17] trusting that God is going to bring to
[56:19] pass it what his dream his dream was
[56:22] that his vision was that one day he
[56:24] would be sitting on that throne so he's
[56:26] waiting he's waiting for that to come to
[56:28] pass he's trusting that God will bring
[56:30] it to pass patiently patiently with his
[56:33] brother and sister patiently with God
[56:37] knowledge to understand what his place
[56:41] was that he was supposed to come to the
[56:44] throne because God has shown it - I
[56:46] wonder how many today you know wondering
[56:51] what what we're doing here what what the
[56:54] church is for what the bride is for but
[56:56] somebody with knowledge will have an
[56:58] understanding of the day in the hour
[56:59] that we're living in and what's taking
[57:01] place and then temperance doesn't fly
[57:05] off for
[57:06] I lose can't you know talk it out with
[57:09] somebody doesn't jump to conclusions and
[57:11] when Potiphar's wife began to poke and
[57:12] prod at him he didn't roll back he
[57:15] didn't accuse and all different things
[57:16] but you know he just something within
[57:18] him was able to withstand the pressure
[57:20] of the outside and then we get to
[57:23] godliness to be like God I think maybe
[57:28] sometimes that's a little bit confusing
[57:30] sometimes godliness is confusing but you
[57:33] know godliness and and Joseph and Joseph
[57:36] situation down in that prison he began
[57:39] to be shackled he began to realize that
[57:42] his purpose was to fulfill the will of
[57:45] God that's the purpose of every believer
[57:47] when you get to godliness you begin to
[57:50] say that I only do that which is
[57:52] pleasing to the Father because your yoke
[57:55] to that word like Jesus there in the
[57:57] Garden of Gethsemane when he began to he
[57:59] said father let this cup pass from me
[58:01] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[58:04] done see even in his flesh even in his
[58:07] groanings he it was something within me
[58:11] I don't want this to go through all this
[58:13] uh it's not something that I'm looking
[58:17] forward to certainly and you know many
[58:19] things in the Christian journey you it's
[58:22] not a lot of fun to go through but yet
[58:24] it's bringing it it's fulfilling the
[58:27] Word of God brother Branham had to go
[58:29] through all of the things of his wife
[58:31] pass it away and his child all those
[58:33] things that he tells in his life story
[58:35] to see God's Word made manifest in his
[58:37] life the Psalms 119 49 50 it says
[58:44] remember the word under thy servant upon
[58:47] which thou has caused me to hope this is
[58:50] my comfort in my affliction for thy word
[58:52] hath quickened me
[58:54] that's the comfort that we have in our
[58:56] affliction that we've heard the word and
[58:58] job 36 15 he said it says he delivered
[59:01] the poor in his affliction and openeth
[59:03] their ears and oppression think about
[59:05] that and oppression your ears become
[59:08] open Bob of course you're going through
[59:10] a squeezing time you begin to trust in
[59:12] God more but God has given us something
[59:16] to rejoice about
[59:18] Paul said in Ephesians 4:6 20 he said
[59:21] for me that utterance may be given unto
[59:23] me that I may open my mouth boldly to
[59:25] make known the mystery of the gospel for
[59:28] which I am an ambassador in bonds that
[59:30] there and I may speak boldly as I ought
[59:32] to speak you see as you climb up this
[59:36] mountain I believe that you become more
[59:38] and more yoked to God you become more
[59:40] and more unwilling to do anything that
[59:43] would be displeasing to God unwilling to
[59:45] do anything that would be displeasing to
[59:47] him that would sever that relationship
[59:49] you know when Jesus could say I and my
[59:52] father are one
[59:53] I and my father are one that means that
[59:56] there they were United I there's no
[1:00:00] there's no they he didn't want to break
[1:00:06] any kind of fellowship and you know a
[1:00:08] believer today to come to a place where
[1:00:12] you can see I and my father are one
[1:00:14] means you've got to be so yoked to the
[1:00:17] word until you're ready to go through
[1:00:19] the fire like the three of you children
[1:00:21] you're ready to go into the Lions Den
[1:00:22] like Daniel you're ready to do you're
[1:00:25] ready to die like Peter did you're ready
[1:00:27] to die like the the early Christians
[1:00:29] that they put them out on the lakes of
[1:00:30] ice and and sit there and watched over
[1:00:33] them until they died until they froze in
[1:00:35] the cold
[1:00:35] I believe this that's what we're coming
[1:00:38] to to where it doesn't matter I you know
[1:00:42] it doesn't matter what people say what
[1:00:45] people say on the internet it doesn't
[1:00:47] matter what people say well we're coming
[1:00:49] to a place where we're we're ready to
[1:00:51] speak freely about what we believe that
[1:00:53] we're ready to share these kind of
[1:00:55] mysterious things that maybe we've been
[1:00:57] holding back on all these years all down
[1:01:01] through these these last maybe 20-30
[1:01:03] years however many it seems like maybe
[1:01:05] now people are ready to cut loose and
[1:01:08] share exactly what they really believe
[1:01:11] about about the message of the hour why
[1:01:14] because we're coming to a perfect faith
[1:01:16] and we've got a perfect word to bring us
[1:01:19] to that a perfect faith and a perfect
[1:01:21] word I'm trying to close here yo I know
[1:01:26] sometimes you get a little bit technical
[1:01:27] and everything and it starts to you know
[1:01:31] so hang on they're with me but listen
[1:01:36] listen so let me let me bring him back
[1:01:39] around to where where I first started
[1:01:41] from you need to be equipped you need to
[1:01:44] be equipped with a word birth to take
[1:01:46] this journey Rob Rotman the message
[1:01:48] perfect faith he said he and the
[1:01:51] questions and answers on the seals is
[1:01:52] really where I'm talking about he he
[1:01:54] started when he began to talk about how
[1:01:56] that the mystery of the seven seals had
[1:02:00] gone from the people he began to talk
[1:02:03] about how that it wasn't for them he
[1:02:04] said you're not supposed to know these
[1:02:06] things so don't put no interpretation to
[1:02:08] it but then if you keep reading out a
[1:02:10] little bit further he begins to talk
[1:02:11] about a listening post the listening
[1:02:15] post and he said now now here's a post
[1:02:17] and that's what we'll call that a
[1:02:18] listening post see and it's got radio C
[1:02:21] and there's warnings and things can be
[1:02:24] done like a sword in your hand C it can
[1:02:26] pick from the evil or pick from only as
[1:02:28] it gets this message C did you and n
[1:02:31] begins to talk about how there's 10,000
[1:02:33] voices in the room did you know there's
[1:02:34] ten thousands of voices in this room
[1:02:37] right now see listen you start off you
[1:02:40] start off your journey getting equipped
[1:02:43] with that teacher that will teach you
[1:02:45] from the inside in other words you've
[1:02:47] got to have that equipment to be able to
[1:02:50] receive the message for your day you got
[1:02:53] to be able to you got to be able to to
[1:02:55] tune in to the radio station to get the
[1:02:58] word to get the revelation and as you
[1:03:00] keep growing up you're you're tuning
[1:03:02] into the frequency and and and you begin
[1:03:05] to hear different things
[1:03:07] I mean honestly when when the preaching
[1:03:09] of the gospel goes forth everybody in
[1:03:12] here is hearing a different message
[1:03:13] everybody's hearing something different
[1:03:15] depending on where you are what you're
[1:03:16] struggling with all the different things
[1:03:18] but you're tuning in because that
[1:03:20] receiver on the inside is giving you
[1:03:22] exactly what you need what you have need
[1:03:24] of but see listen brother Brown began to
[1:03:27] talk about how that see when you grow up
[1:03:29] you begin to grow up to a place where
[1:03:33] it's time to get this perfect faith and
[1:03:35] he began to talk about this listening
[1:03:37] post see it wasn't time back then it
[1:03:40] wasn't time it wasn't possible for you
[1:03:43] to turn in to tune in to that
[1:03:44] see you know of course some dear some
[1:03:48] some continue in and everything but I
[1:03:50] believe now is the time we're getting
[1:03:53] our frequency tuned in you know this the
[1:03:56] seals can't be open to a little baby
[1:03:58] the seals can't be open to somebody
[1:03:59] until they've until they've grown up to
[1:04:01] a place what God looks at them and says
[1:04:04] yo you've got all the virtues it's time
[1:04:07] for the headstone to come then then that
[1:04:10] capstone revelation can be revealed with
[1:04:12] that person and see listen here's
[1:04:14] another thing that's kind of interesting
[1:04:15] about the head can when they're hit
[1:04:17] whenever the head comes when the head
[1:04:20] comes to the church even when the head
[1:04:22] comes to a to your own family when a man
[1:04:25] takes headship over his family it will
[1:04:28] always cause a disturbance it always
[1:04:30] causes a disturbance when a man begins
[1:04:32] to say this whole house is mine see you
[1:04:36] this and this day a lot of times people
[1:04:37] say well the man is supposed to have a
[1:04:39] man cave and put him off to the side
[1:04:42] somewhere but God doesn't have a man
[1:04:45] cave the whole house is his he comes in
[1:04:48] and he sits down and he says it's all
[1:04:50] mine
[1:04:51] everywhere I if I want to go in the
[1:04:53] kitchen if I want to go in the in the
[1:04:55] bedroom everywhere I've got free reign
[1:04:57] of this house let's see see listen even
[1:05:00] in the natural if a man begins to start
[1:05:03] putting his foot down about in this
[1:05:04] house and Maya asks for me and my house
[1:05:07] we will serve the Lord many times it
[1:05:10] creates a disturbance and you see
[1:05:12] sometimes that you see you see you still
[1:05:14] see men that are in the kind of a little
[1:05:16] baby form and they don't they hadn't
[1:05:17] quite taken figured out how to take
[1:05:19] headship over their house you know you
[1:05:22] you can take head try to take headship
[1:05:24] in a lot of different ways but I believe
[1:05:25] that the way a Christian takes headship
[1:05:27] over their home is by the Word of God
[1:05:29] listen you can get a lot more love
[1:05:32] either you get your wife to love you a
[1:05:34] lot more by getting down on your knees
[1:05:36] and spending time with the kids opening
[1:05:38] up the word that'll get out a whole lot
[1:05:40] more love and respect out of your wife
[1:05:42] and out of your children then then a lot
[1:05:44] of other things it'll get a whole lot
[1:05:46] more respect than a Hallmark card let's
[1:05:48] say like that
[1:05:55] so what what what I was getting at is
[1:05:58] [Laughter]
[1:06:01] we're able now we're able now because
[1:06:04] we've heard the word and we've gone
[1:06:06] through all these struggles and we've
[1:06:07] gone through all these things we've come
[1:06:10] to a place now where we're able to tune
[1:06:12] in to the right frequency I believe I
[1:06:14] don't believe it's a far fish to say
[1:06:16] that we're we're at a place now where
[1:06:17] we're we can begin to tune in to the
[1:06:20] frequency of the capstone revelation we
[1:06:23] begin we can begin to to look at we
[1:06:25] don't get bored when we come to church
[1:06:26] and somebody's breaking down the seven
[1:06:28] trumpets and the seven vials and the
[1:06:30] seven seals and the seven churches and
[1:06:32] all the things that go into that because
[1:06:34] something down on the inside of us is is
[1:06:37] feeding on that we're waiting we're
[1:06:39] waiting we're longing for the transfer
[1:06:41] for something to change within us you
[1:06:44] see where we're not just coming to
[1:06:46] church just to occupy pew or sit in
[1:06:48] church just to have fun or just to be
[1:06:51] seen or just to make to network and then
[1:06:54] try to find job relationships and things
[1:06:56] like that or to get to enjoy the good
[1:06:59] coffee like many people do but we're
[1:07:01] coming to church to be to be made
[1:07:03] overcomers to be transformed by the
[1:07:05] renewing of our mind because what he's
[1:07:13] not he's not coming back for a little
[1:07:15] baby baby bride he's coming back for a
[1:07:17] mature word bride and that's what the
[1:07:20] Prophet said he would be pointing to the
[1:07:22] skies to a word born bride not a little
[1:07:25] baby not somebody that's just so easily
[1:07:27] offended so easily pricked and marred
[1:07:30] and and doesn't know what's right and
[1:07:32] what's wrong
[1:07:32] but I believe that we're coming to a
[1:07:35] place where we know listen when Joseph
[1:07:37] got that throne when you when you sit
[1:07:41] with him on that throne let me let me
[1:07:44] preach on that for a second because you
[1:07:48] know you know that story about the UH I
[1:07:53] got it right here I think I do
[1:08:00] yes I do Matthew chapter 20 when this
[1:08:07] the mother of the sons of zebedee she
[1:08:09] began to ask Jesus can my can my son sit
[1:08:12] on the right hand or to the left hand
[1:08:13] and I'm gonna just read this for a
[1:08:16] second I'm closing here hang on just for
[1:08:19] a second
[1:08:21] Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the
[1:08:23] twelve disciples a part of the way and
[1:08:24] said unto them this is Matthew 20 verse
[1:08:26] 17 behold we go up to Jerusalem and the
[1:08:29] Son of man shall be betrayed into the
[1:08:30] chief priests and under the scribes and
[1:08:32] they shall condemn him to death and
[1:08:33] shall deliver him to the Gentiles the
[1:08:36] mock and to scourge and to crucify him
[1:08:37] and the third day he shall rise again he
[1:08:40] just got 'told telling a very sound like
[1:08:43] a very sad thing he's gonna get
[1:08:45] crucified all this kind of stuff and
[1:08:47] then right after that right after he
[1:08:50] told all the things that company he
[1:08:52] would have to drink the persecution and
[1:08:53] all this kind of stuff then then came to
[1:08:57] him the mother of Zebedee's children
[1:08:58] with her sons worshiping him and
[1:08:59] desiring a certain thing of him and he
[1:09:02] said what wilt thou she say the name
[1:09:04] grant that these two my two sons may sit
[1:09:06] the one on thy right hand and the other
[1:09:08] on the left in that Kingdom but jesus
[1:09:10] answered and said you know not what she
[1:09:12] asked are you able to drink of the cup
[1:09:13] that I shall drink of and to be baptized
[1:09:16] with the baptism that I am baptized with
[1:09:18] they they say unto Him we are able and
[1:09:20] he said unto them ye shall drink indeed
[1:09:22] of my cup and be baptized with the
[1:09:24] baptism that I am baptized with but to
[1:09:26] sit on my right hand and on my left is
[1:09:28] not mine to give but that she'll be it
[1:09:30] shall be given to them for whom and it's
[1:09:32] prepared of my father why did he say
[1:09:34] that it's not mine to give because
[1:09:35] listen I put it like this that seat was
[1:09:38] reserved not that there's a right hand
[1:09:40] or a left hand seat or something like
[1:09:42] that but listen you've got every down
[1:09:44] through these seven Church ages
[1:09:45] everybody has a place that's reserved
[1:09:48] for them for them a place a partial
[1:09:51] portion of the word for each of them to
[1:09:52] fulfill in their hour and your portion
[1:09:55] and this day there's someone this prove
[1:09:57] this that's that their portion their
[1:09:59] seat I'll put it like that their seat is
[1:10:01] to fulfill the adoption to fill coming
[1:10:04] to a place where you sit and authority
[1:10:06] over over what those three things were
[1:10:08] that their brother has said sin Satan
[1:10:11] and
[1:10:11] flesh to sit in authority over there you
[1:10:14] think about how when you come to
[1:10:15] Authority when you come to that throne
[1:10:18] when you come to sit with him in the
[1:10:20] Father's throne
[1:10:21] then you're in authority over those
[1:10:23] three things overseeing why because sin
[1:10:25] has been cast out sin has been cast out
[1:10:28] of your being cast out of you that God
[1:10:30] has come to take over because he gave
[1:10:32] you the equipment on your day of
[1:10:34] Pentecost he filled you with the Holy
[1:10:36] Ghost and down in your soul he began to
[1:10:38] work out and out from you all the sin
[1:10:40] all the unbelief until until you got all
[1:10:43] that lined up in your conscious your
[1:10:44] subconscious and it matches up with the
[1:10:47] Word of God
[1:10:47] and over Satan why why because when
[1:10:51] Satan looks at a man like this with
[1:10:54] perfect faith a perfect a perfect man he
[1:10:58] doesn't know what to do with it he jumps
[1:11:01] around like Potiphar's wife and pokes
[1:11:03] and prods and says well like Potiphar's
[1:11:05] wife if you read in the in the scripture
[1:11:07] she kept coming over and over well how
[1:11:09] about now how about now you know and I'm
[1:11:12] sure she you know dressed the part and
[1:11:14] and adorned herself all in all kinds of
[1:11:17] ways and kept badgering him and kept
[1:11:19] badgering him listen a man like this
[1:11:23] can't be hindered like by Satan saying
[1:11:27] Satan can't get to it
[1:11:29] brother Brahim said a man you can get
[1:11:31] you can come to the place where the
[1:11:33] devil doesn't know what to do with you
[1:11:36] because you're you come to a place of
[1:11:38] authority over sin Satan and the flesh
[1:11:42] because listen if you come to a place
[1:11:44] where you're conscious and your
[1:11:46] subconscious agrees with the Word of God
[1:11:48] where the spirit and the bride and the
[1:11:51] prophet are all in agreement your body
[1:11:53] will have to be changed your flesh will
[1:11:56] have to be changed
[1:11:58] you know the musicians could go ahead
[1:12:01] and come I'm trying to wind up here you
[1:12:03] could he gave us he's given us in this
[1:12:06] day by a perfect message by perfect word
[1:12:10] overcoming power to sit in authority to
[1:12:13] have dominion over sin Satan and the
[1:12:15] flesh to have and you can see that in
[1:12:18] the life of Joseph where Joseph started
[1:12:20] off being equipped he went through all
[1:12:21] these things when you look you look
[1:12:23] around and you're like think back to
[1:12:24] your
[1:12:25] life were you think about all the things
[1:12:27] that happen to you that we're
[1:12:28] discouraging all the things that you
[1:12:31] know I you know you think about people
[1:12:35] that I've gone through things in my life
[1:12:38] where what people would begin to ask me
[1:12:41] well if you if you've got what you say
[1:12:43] you do why don't you just speak and cast
[1:12:45] it out or whatever speaking and and
[1:12:47] bring ela you know make all these dares
[1:12:49] and all this kind of stuff all that all
[1:12:52] that stuff all those hard likes all
[1:12:54] those travails that you can look back on
[1:12:56] where to bring you into a perfect place
[1:12:58] into a perfect faith and I'm gonna stop
[1:13:05] right there you can stand with me
