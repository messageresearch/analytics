[28:09] 7.
[28:11] now remember the lord willing on the 2nd
[28:14] of october brother keith reed will be
[28:16] here preaching for us for the weekend
[28:19] now to the children especially
[28:23] we've got you some new basketball goals
[28:25] and got some new basketballs
[28:27] down there so we're asking you to do
[28:31] for us you know and help us now i know
[28:33] uh kids that the bigger ones they want
[28:35] to play and bounce on the asphalt you
[28:38] know and it does work better i know that
[28:40] but i'm sorry but we designated and and
[28:44] and richard and terence and zach and
[28:48] all
[28:49] just a whole bunch got down there and
[28:51] fixed the goal where the the little kids
[28:53] could play so that's that one on the
[28:55] asphalt now at the end there is made for
[28:58] the little bitty kids you know the
[29:00] little little bitty girls and
[29:03] little boys that
[29:04] you know that can get out there and play
[29:06] so now please kids go on down to yours
[29:09] and play
[29:10] and you know
[29:12] uh do the best you can down there and
[29:14] have some shooting goals and things you
[29:16] know but don't be up trying to be with
[29:19] the little kids we're trying to make it
[29:20] as safe as possible
[29:22] but we want the little kids to have a
[29:24] good time too
[29:25] because you know they've been kind of
[29:26] pushed out we had the big goals and
[29:28] couldn't do it now we've got it fixed
[29:30] where we can do that and we're in the
[29:32] process of trying to buy some new swing
[29:34] sets
[29:35] and things of that order and we just ask
[29:38] you to help us you know to do and if we
[29:41] come out and we put a little poster sign
[29:43] up on there and says
[29:44] no child under a certain age swings on
[29:47] this we'll please abide by kids because
[29:49] we're we're going to spend a lot of
[29:51] money it's going to cost up and weigh
[29:53] into the thousands of dollars to buy two
[29:56] different swing sets
[29:58] one for the little kids and one for the
[29:59] bigger kids to swing on so you know we
[30:02] don't want to tire up the little kids
[30:04] things and i know some of you get out
[30:06] there and and want to play on the monkey
[30:08] bars and walk the top well um parents if
[30:11] i was you i'd instruct my kids not to
[30:13] try to walk on top of them beans up
[30:15] there you know because they're small and
[30:17] they can get hurt so uh you know just uh
[30:22] adults instruct and then when we do get
[30:24] that set up we will probably try to like
[30:26] in you know appoint a person to stay out
[30:28] there
[30:29] and direct and make sure that everything
[30:31] goes good you know with the kids because
[30:34] we want you to play we just don't want
[30:35] you get hurt
[30:37] so don't get up on the top of those bars
[30:39] and walk out across there that you know
[30:41] i know your kids and i like to play
[30:43] tarzan when i was a kid too we swung out
[30:45] the trees and you know and all like that
[30:48] but brother ray tried it yesterday
[30:50] stepping out of the van with the bus and
[30:51] wound up laying on the ground
[30:53] but i didn't hear him yelling like
[30:55] tarzan
[30:56] we thank god that he was with him
[30:58] because he did slip and fall and just
[31:01] flat on his back right there
[31:03] and we got some scratches out of it but
[31:05] he he's still all right we thank god for
[31:07] that
[31:08] we didn't want nobody to get hurt amen
[31:11] but just remember that kids okay
[31:14] genesis 1 26 and 27 we'll try to pick up
[31:17] the point and move on then we'll go to
[31:19] genesis 2 7. heavenly father we thank
[31:22] you for your loving your grace and to us
[31:24] we thank you
[31:25] that you are god and you change not
[31:28] and that way we can depend upon what
[31:31] you say
[31:33] and we thank you and we ask you to just
[31:35] help us
[31:36] help us to realize realization lord
[31:39] to be able to be your children to be
[31:41] your offspring
[31:43] and what you'd have for us to be here
[31:44] upon earth we love you and we thank you
[31:48] bless the little ride around the world
[31:50] lord remember sister faith our brother
[31:52] richards we forgot this morning but we
[31:55] you know you remember
[31:56] and sister faye was real sick and in the
[31:59] hospital so we ask you to reach down and
[32:01] touch her
[32:02] and just bless each one we love you and
[32:04] we thank you
[32:05] have your way now in jesus name
[32:08] amen
[32:10] so we go to
[32:11] genesis 1 26 and 27 and then we'll go to
[32:14] 2-7 because we're trying to tie together
[32:16] the the point
[32:18] of what we've been what we're talking
[32:20] about this morning right
[32:25] and god said let us make man in our
[32:27] image after a likeness and let them have
[32:29] dominion over the fish of the sea
[32:31] and over the fowl of the iron over the
[32:33] cattle and over all the earth and over
[32:35] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[32:37] the earth
[32:39] so god created man in his own image in
[32:41] the image of god created in him male and
[32:45] female created he them
[32:48] now we go over genesis 2 7 and the lord
[32:50] god form man out
[32:52] man of the dust of the ground
[32:55] and breathed into his nostrils breath of
[32:57] life and man became
[33:00] a living soul you may be seated the lord
[33:03] had his blessing to the
[33:04] reading of the word
[33:07] now
[33:08] i hope that we
[33:11] you know
[33:14] had a have an understanding to
[33:16] to you know
[33:18] understand the point of what
[33:21] we're trying to get to this morning
[33:23] of the
[33:26] creation of the spiritual man
[33:28] now
[33:30] the spiritual man
[33:32] 126-27 the prophet we gave this morning
[33:35] was created before the foundation of the
[33:38] world
[33:40] but the natural man of genesis 2 7
[33:44] he was created on the sixth day
[33:48] all right
[33:49] and
[33:50] doing that then the spiritual man was
[33:52] created before the world the natural man
[33:54] was created
[33:56] and
[33:56] in the creation of lining up one two
[33:59] three four five six seven day okay we
[34:01] know in genesis 2
[34:04] then
[34:05] that it goes on to about verse 20 to 25
[34:09] and it speaks about
[34:11] the fact that god
[34:13] put adam to sleep
[34:15] and took a rib and made him a help meet
[34:19] all right that would have been in the
[34:21] sixth
[34:22] day
[34:23] of the creation of man see nothing was
[34:26] created in the seventh day
[34:28] god rested i know that's contrary to
[34:32] the jewish teaching they say that
[34:34] they're seven days creation
[34:36] but i can't find it but then some of the
[34:39] others believe
[34:41] too that more was created but that's all
[34:43] right that's their business
[34:45] now what i want you to see today
[34:49] is one thing
[34:52] all right
[34:53] now he was made a spiritual man
[34:57] before the foundation of the world
[34:59] and so i was trying to explain about the
[35:02] word creation
[35:04] and to get you to see that when we look
[35:08] at something and we talk about creation
[35:10] our human mind locks on to the point of
[35:13] of like something that was not in
[35:16] existence
[35:17] and then it comes into existence
[35:20] and we we try to make some kind of a
[35:22] certain beginning of things
[35:25] instead of making it to where that we
[35:28] can
[35:28] can uh stay with it in the correct order
[35:32] the word creation doesn't always signify
[35:36] something that's coming into being that
[35:38] as i said that didn't exist
[35:42] it's just a way of stating
[35:44] what
[35:45] you know what it is
[35:48] it's a creation right it means that it
[35:50] was maybe
[35:52] not in that form before
[35:55] but then it became into a form
[35:59] to be able to be seen
[36:01] and we covered where the prophet of god
[36:03] said that god's
[36:05] first creation was himself
[36:10] and then out of that came the logos
[36:12] the another creation
[36:15] but that's not another creation like a
[36:18] different creation
[36:20] it's the same creation in another form
[36:24] another way of doing to where he can
[36:25] reveal himself like i said about the the
[36:28] the fish you know jesus didn't
[36:30] they didn't walk up to him and hand him
[36:32] the fish and the loaves and he said well
[36:33] go set that down over there i'll just do
[36:35] it from here
[36:37] no he took that
[36:40] and he kept from that of the original
[36:43] creation
[36:44] because that way then you can tie all
[36:47] together all right
[36:49] now
[36:50] so as we see them
[36:53] we come to the
[36:55] point of
[36:56] the natural creation
[36:58] of man
[36:59] and
[37:01] that natural creation was brought into
[37:03] being is
[37:04] looking even like the animals
[37:08] but i hope you was listening this
[37:10] morning that
[37:12] god is a
[37:14] person
[37:15] he's real
[37:18] right
[37:19] he has a body
[37:22] he has a place he lives
[37:24] he has a house to live in the prophet of
[37:26] god said
[37:28] all right
[37:28] then in all of that
[37:31] as i tried to explain in the previous
[37:34] messages we look at things here and we
[37:37] tap it on the pulpit of those maybe on
[37:39] tape or something
[37:41] that we think this wood this is oak wood
[37:44] and it's really
[37:45] you know extremely hard
[37:47] and and all because one of the hardest
[37:49] of our woods here in this part of the
[37:51] country
[37:52] uh maybe the hickory a little harder but
[37:56] it's firm and solid
[37:59] and all but you know
[38:00] that's
[38:01] not really
[38:02] the hard that's not real
[38:05] the world above us is what's real
[38:08] the dimensions above us is more real
[38:10] than we are
[38:11] and if we would look at that and stay
[38:13] with that point
[38:15] then we could see that you know god is
[38:18] real as we keep going up
[38:21] and we would we would find a play
[38:23] somewhere
[38:26] that
[38:28] you know we could find what reality
[38:30] really is or what something is real
[38:34] all right
[38:35] now
[38:37] to look at the man then
[38:40] see brother branham said he took that
[38:44] 126 and 27 man
[38:46] and he said that's the catch that where
[38:48] people don't understand
[38:50] he said they don't see
[38:52] that there was a spiritual creation in
[38:54] genesis 1
[38:55] and then a physical creation in genesis
[38:58] 2.
[38:59] all right so then he took the man of
[39:01] genesis 1 put him into the
[39:03] physical body of genesis 2 but when he
[39:07] put him in there he put him in a special
[39:09] way because
[39:10] he
[39:12] he put him there as one body
[39:14] there was only one body standing there
[39:16] any place within him
[39:18] the theophany
[39:21] the eternal life of god
[39:23] came into adam
[39:25] well brother branham you can go back to
[39:27] those questions and answers in genesis i
[39:29] ask you to do and you'll see in dark
[39:31] you know i'm trying to cut down instead
[39:33] of bringing so much to you
[39:36] and you know but brother brown said he
[39:38] was in adam and
[39:41] that's theophany
[39:42] well
[39:43] now he said her natural being
[39:47] now listen
[39:50] her natural being
[39:53] has elements
[39:56] would be called a by-product
[39:59] right
[40:00] right but he said in her spiritual
[40:02] condition
[40:05] she was not in my brother right
[40:09] right
[40:11] now
[40:12] so follow that line with me now
[40:15] and he said a true husband and wife
[40:18] becomes one in god
[40:22] he said their hearts beat as one they
[40:24] become one in their thinking and they're
[40:26] doing
[40:27] and he said as they do that then truly
[40:29] they're coming back to look like and it
[40:31] was there that adam and eve in the
[40:34] garden standing there in a beautiful
[40:36] condition before sin entered would be a
[40:39] type of christ in the church
[40:42] and so is a husband and wife
[40:44] truly you know a husband and wife
[40:47] they become one together
[40:49] and then their hearts speed is one
[40:52] then
[40:53] why wouldn't you believe that he could
[40:55] say that he was in adam
[40:58] in theophany
[41:01] and then separated why wouldn't we
[41:03] accept that as being a truth because
[41:06] what i've tried to get you to see
[41:08] is that genesis 1 26 is just one person
[41:12] yeah right right that's not
[41:15] a lot of people
[41:17] but ron said that's where he made man
[41:20] not
[41:21] amen you know like
[41:23] he made man
[41:24] all right
[41:25] so then
[41:27] when you come forth in genesis 2
[41:30] and you put that into a body
[41:33] you see him standing there
[41:36] and what we're looking at a lot of times
[41:38] our mind will lock on a point
[41:40] that we'll only see adam as
[41:43] uh you know that say well
[41:45] it took out the feminist
[41:48] part
[41:50] you know and put it into a body called
[41:53] eve which their name wasn't eve at that
[41:56] time
[41:57] i like what brother stephen wilson said
[41:58] the other day he said when you get down
[42:01] do you call her eve she'd become a
[42:02] byproduct
[42:04] that's when she really messed up because
[42:06] her name wasn't even
[42:09] her name was adam
[42:11] when she developed the name king richie
[42:14] scripture when the name came of eve that
[42:16] meant the mother of all living right
[42:19] theirs were something messed up by that
[42:21] time
[42:22] it was getting all confused
[42:24] but see
[42:26] and i'm not
[42:27] i know the quotes of brother branham and
[42:29] i i love to read
[42:32] and see what he has to say
[42:35] and he said we have taken the woman and
[42:36] made her our god
[42:39] but said remember
[42:43] eve was made for adam
[42:45] right now
[42:46] that's right
[42:48] not adam
[42:50] now i know the women don't like those
[42:53] terminologies
[42:55] but this church should realize by now
[42:57] what brother dale has tried to preach
[42:58] over 40 years to you amen that i am not
[43:02] what is the word i don't i don't i can't
[43:04] finish
[43:06] what's what's that word
[43:10] showing his stick or whatever it is i
[43:12] don't know
[43:13] i'm not the kind that pushes women down
[43:17] all right never what y'all put the words
[43:19] to it
[43:21] i don't have enough education
[43:24] i don't put the women down
[43:26] but i don't push the woman up okay
[43:29] okay
[43:31] so then you ought to realize that we're
[43:33] in a position
[43:35] to where we hold it correct that brother
[43:37] adams would say that on one side she is
[43:40] a symbolic
[43:41] symbol of all things
[43:44] dirty
[43:46] unholy
[43:48] garbage cans
[43:50] and we call her sex deposits you know
[43:54] disposal excuse me
[43:57] and uh but he said on the other hand
[44:00] she's the top of everything beautiful
[44:03] he said she's the top of the bride of
[44:05] christ
[44:09] after a while we're going to get down to
[44:10] where brother branham said something
[44:12] that is going to
[44:14] shock you just a little
[44:16] about most people in their ways of
[44:18] talking about a byproduct
[44:20] i said in most people's ways of talking
[44:22] about a bright brother
[44:25] to me i hear preachers preach about
[44:27] women and by product
[44:29] you know i don't like the jokes where he
[44:31] said yeah they buy products they'll buy
[44:32] every product they can get
[44:34] i don't like that that is silly
[44:38] most men are outspenders and more than
[44:40] women
[44:42] and i just
[44:43] you know
[44:45] would you spend theirs on hunting and
[44:46] fishing and
[44:48] stuff like that
[44:50] i've
[44:51] killed about 30 deer in my lifetime and
[44:54] if i calculated how much it cost me per
[44:56] pound i would have about a hundred
[44:59] thousand dollars per pound in every deer
[45:01] that i've killed
[45:03] so i don't think we need to talk about
[45:05] spending and garbage who's spending too
[45:07] much or what
[45:08] you know
[45:09] i think we ought to just settle down be
[45:11] human forget it
[45:13] and that's what i try to be
[45:15] i don't try to build up i don't try to
[45:17] turn down i try to just state and try to
[45:20] state all that brother branham had to
[45:22] say right
[45:24] but
[45:25] how would you write a statement like
[45:26] this boy you cut it off out there on me
[45:28] on the internet you good because
[45:30] you make me say something bad but
[45:33] how would you like it if brother brown
[45:35] called the bride the bride
[45:39] a byproduct
[45:44] so stay with me
[45:46] paul harvey we get to get to page two
[45:50] but we're not gonna get there right now
[45:52] all right
[45:53] just to make that the word
[45:55] you know
[45:56] you better search out what you're
[45:57] talking about instead of trying to do
[45:59] because what i think most preachers are
[46:02] talking about when they called a woman
[46:04] to byproduct they're talking about them
[46:06] as porterhouse steaks
[46:08] and maybe they might give the woman the
[46:10] right to be
[46:11] uh
[46:13] hamburger
[46:16] and and my wife is very choicey about it
[46:19] and
[46:20] she she doesn't like to buy this regular
[46:22] hamburger meat
[46:24] all right she gets to what is the
[46:26] ground ground
[46:28] brown round as we call it she likes to
[46:31] get that for the hamburger meat all
[46:34] right now i remember when we were so
[46:36] poor
[46:37] that we ate the hamburger meat
[46:43] and what was it used to put in it uh
[46:48] no
[46:49] what are you used to stirring the
[46:50] hamburger meat years ago
[46:53] um
[46:57] well no not the heifers that's later
[46:58] this is on down i'm talking about
[46:59] welding back when i'm dipping
[47:01] red in it we used to put bread but it's
[47:03] not called bread it was something else
[47:06] oatmeal
[47:08] okay
[47:10] used to put oatmeal
[47:13] some of you ain't old enough to know
[47:14] that we ate oatmeal hamburgers
[47:18] all right
[47:19] but it went down and it took care of a
[47:21] lot of things down in the body and we
[47:23] lived
[47:25] and i didn't know what a steak was until
[47:27] i got married
[47:29] i told you i thought when my wife cooked
[47:31] the first chicken she cooked the breast
[47:33] and asked her what in the world the
[47:34] thing was and all i was used to was the
[47:37] neck and the wings
[47:40] you know what we didn't get that when we
[47:42] was kids the preacher got the chicken
[47:45] all right
[47:47] make sure you don't go to sleep
[47:49] but listen
[47:51] see that's what i think people do
[47:54] you see the mail showing us pigs as
[47:57] we're calling a lot of times
[48:00] they want to down everybody
[48:04] why
[48:06] truth is truth
[48:09] your sisters have a place
[48:13] you have the right to prophet said and
[48:15] we'll get to it in a little bit that was
[48:17] where she was made she has a right to
[48:19] say yes or no
[48:22] and you don't blame nobody else don't
[48:23] blame nobody for how you wound up being
[48:26] made in your body
[48:29] you blame yourself for what you are
[48:31] that's right
[48:32] and then you do something about it
[48:36] it's almost to the point that it's just
[48:38] about like that women can't even be
[48:40] saved
[48:41] and i've even heard preachers preach
[48:43] that women shall be saved in
[48:45] childbearing and they just stop
[48:48] and i asked this brother one day i said
[48:50] why don't you quote the rest of that
[48:51] verse
[48:52] he said what i quoted the verse i said
[48:54] no you didn't you left off the last part
[48:58] i said you said some woman shall be
[49:00] chilled saved in
[49:01] you left off where it says if she
[49:03] continues in the faith
[49:05] you didn't talk about that if you just
[49:06] talk about her having babies she's going
[49:08] to be saved that's catholic church
[49:11] sister anna you mean it
[49:13] she came from there that's catholic
[49:15] church
[49:16] that's why they don't believe in birth
[49:17] controls right
[49:19] and things like that all right
[49:21] now let's go on
[49:23] get all the natural out
[49:27] but you know that one thing i like i
[49:30] looked for this and i found the part
[49:31] where i'm talking about adam
[49:33] brother adam said god
[49:35] looked down on adam
[49:39] and saw him not by himself
[49:43] he said he saw him lonely
[49:47] you know what because he was in heaven
[49:51] but there is a quote that runs close
[49:53] similar to it that
[49:55] he said because god
[49:57] at one time was lonely
[50:00] you know god had attributes in him to be
[50:02] a savior a healer deliverer etc you know
[50:06] father
[50:08] all of that
[50:10] and you know he wanted them displayed
[50:11] that's why he was lonely
[50:14] all right
[50:15] but he said adam was lonely
[50:18] because he had nobody he could look at
[50:19] the animals he could see them the male
[50:21] and the female he could see all of the
[50:23] things
[50:24] but nobody for him
[50:27] so god put him to sleep and
[50:29] made him
[50:30] help me it says
[50:32] now a lot of people read that and they
[50:34] still ain't getting it right it doesn't
[50:36] say help mate
[50:37] you make it don't say that read your
[50:39] bible
[50:41] it says help meet m-e-e-t
[50:45] two men can be mates
[50:47] two women can be mates
[50:50] but a wife is really a part of a man
[50:53] that's the way they ought to consider it
[50:55] and that's why don't ever ask me to do a
[50:58] wedding
[50:58] to work that you want to keep your
[51:00] mighty name right i'll tell you up front
[51:02] i ain't going to do it
[51:05] because that's what we took totally
[51:07] derogatory to the bible
[51:10] to say i'm going to keep my maiden name
[51:12] no
[51:13] we'll get into a few things in a minute
[51:14] maybe about a by-product
[51:17] but that's what i said i see most people
[51:19] talk about byproducts and just like and
[51:21] they preach it that she's just a garbage
[51:23] can
[51:25] well
[51:27] why don't they ever get to the point
[51:28] that she's the bride of christ
[51:31] why don't they ever get to the point of
[51:33] realizing they
[51:35] are the bride of christ
[51:37] you know that brothers no matter what
[51:39] you think about your masculinity
[51:42] in the body of christ we are feminist
[51:46] because we're body of christ
[51:49] he's the man we're the the
[51:52] wife
[51:54] that goes beyond your natural
[51:56] comprehension man
[51:58] but now get what i'm saying
[52:02] the spiritual man first genesis 1 26
[52:05] made in the image of god
[52:07] because that was god
[52:11] the genesis 2 man was the man that was
[52:14] put in the garden adam
[52:16] to start that part of it
[52:19] and i'm going to try to go through a
[52:20] certain way this evening and then i'll
[52:22] drop back
[52:24] to pick up
[52:25] the whole
[52:27] thing of mankind
[52:28] and maybe wednesday
[52:32] but
[52:33] see when he put him in in flesh
[52:37] even though and that was what made him
[52:39] lonely
[52:42] what made him lonely was
[52:44] the in flesh inside of him
[52:47] was something else
[52:51] now
[52:52] i know two ways brother random does it
[52:54] and i'll try to give you both of them
[52:57] he covers it the word that it looked
[52:59] like in a scale going across some quotes
[53:02] that
[53:05] god didn't think enough of her to put
[53:07] her in the first creation
[53:09] does he say she's not an original
[53:15] and you can take that and you can run a
[53:16] long line of things
[53:19] that she was not in the original
[53:22] and then not being in the original then
[53:25] she would have been a byproduct
[53:29] but most people don't look up byproduct
[53:31] anyway
[53:32] they know all about it they're already
[53:34] educated spiritually they know all about
[53:36] it but your look up by product
[53:40] it means something of equal
[53:42] value right or even greater
[53:52] yeah brother
[53:54] ain't greater i didn't say that
[53:57] but there's one thing about it
[54:00] your sisters has got something
[54:03] that you can type the bride of christ
[54:08] you can type the bride of christ
[54:13] keep yourself
[54:14] unto your husband girls
[54:19] don't throw it out to everybody else
[54:20] because
[54:21] if they do
[54:22] i'm just blunt to say it you belong to
[54:25] everybody else
[54:27] and that's the same thing with boys
[54:30] keep yourself into the
[54:32] world today when you get married you
[54:34] won't have the problems
[54:37] life
[54:39] you know well i have trouble doing it
[54:42] you ain't got such a trouble
[54:44] as you will have if you go do it wrong
[54:47] all right
[54:48] but now think on it just trying to get
[54:50] something to you
[54:55] we know that eve was not made like the
[54:57] other animals
[55:00] but all the other animals was made in an
[55:02] original creation right
[55:10] but yet
[55:14] brother adam gets on to the other side
[55:16] of what i was saying there that
[55:19] you can bring her out it's
[55:20] you know
[55:21] god didn't even think enough in her to
[55:23] make her like a dog he just made a dog
[55:25] female didn't like that much as a woman
[55:27] well that's not exactly
[55:29] i don't believe the way to go
[55:33] he thought so much of the
[55:38] one we call eve
[55:40] until he never took a lump of clay to
[55:42] make her out of it
[55:46] you took her from adam
[55:52] you don't hear it that way do you
[55:54] no
[55:55] don't want to down see everybody
[55:59] but he thought so much until he didn't
[56:01] go to that
[56:05] he put adam to sleep
[56:08] when adam was lonely why didn't he just
[56:09] take a lot of clay just creating a wife
[56:13] because see she wouldn't have been part
[56:15] of adam
[56:17] and in no way could you have a type
[56:20] out of that
[56:22] because a male and a female animal is
[56:24] not a type of christ in the church
[56:28] we came out of the side of of
[56:30] jesus christ
[56:33] the same as eve came out of adam
[56:38] we had to come out of christ
[56:41] so as i said you can type it in every
[56:43] which way you want it
[56:45] but yet take the real time
[56:49] what was different about eve
[56:54] what was odd and different about her
[57:00] she was created
[57:02] perfect
[57:06] so that's what most people think you
[57:07] know they want to
[57:08] their little thoughts
[57:11] adam is perfect but she just didn't
[57:13] quite make it
[57:17] where do you get that from
[57:20] where did god get any imperfection
[57:24] to create the imperfect
[57:26] all i want to know
[57:31] where did god get anything to bring
[57:33] anything
[57:34] he creates nothing that's not perfect
[57:36] now there's different between the word
[57:37] perfect and
[57:38] eternal all right
[57:41] i didn't say eternal i said perfect
[57:45] he created adam perfect
[57:48] he created me perfect
[57:50] right
[57:53] if you're going to do anything with
[57:54] bringing and talk about byproducts bring
[57:57] it in to break more on over as stephen
[58:00] said when she gets that name
[58:02] and bringing her into the you know the
[58:05] things
[58:07] don't do it in the original because you
[58:08] didn't have a name
[58:11] that's why sisters you lose your name
[58:13] when you get married
[58:14] right
[58:16] that's why we lost our name when we
[58:18] married christ
[58:22] we become christians
[58:25] miss jesus
[58:29] see in that way you can keep it in the
[58:31] perfect order
[58:34] what about her being created
[58:37] co-equal
[58:39] you don't hear these quoted by the
[58:41] byproduct people
[58:42] okay
[58:45] how about being co-equal
[58:48] bring it up my brother
[58:51] anderson
[58:52] trying to remember who's pulling the
[58:54] cords today
[58:57] look what he's right around says on
[58:59] marriage and divorce 1965
[59:02] 2 21 the morning service number one on
[59:04] your notes paragraph 102. look what he
[59:06] says
[59:08] notice why did she do such a thing
[59:11] being in that high order
[59:14] she was right with man
[59:16] co-equal with him
[59:18] we all know that she lost her
[59:20] co-equalness with man when she sinned
[59:24] and then god put her under the rulership
[59:27] notice the reason she had done these
[59:29] things and the way she was doing was
[59:30] what she's not in god's original
[59:33] creation
[59:35] all right
[59:37] now there's a quoting here somewhere
[59:38] where brother brown said
[59:39] that when he created adam
[59:43] he said and see we on the count one day
[59:45] he said it could have been years and
[59:46] years and years and years
[59:49] before eve came into being
[59:51] right
[59:53] but see she was co-equal
[59:58] now for my understanding of co-equal
[1:00:02] it'd be kind of hard to tack on the word
[1:00:04] byproduct there as our understanding of
[1:00:07] my product
[1:00:10] are you listening
[1:00:14] now take that quote from the prophet of
[1:00:16] co-equal
[1:00:18] and slap a by-product on top of it and
[1:00:21] see what what what can you do
[1:00:27] now the reason she's a byproduct
[1:00:30] is that he did not take another lump of
[1:00:32] clay
[1:00:33] and make her out of it
[1:00:36] that's the reason she's a byproduct
[1:00:40] he took a part of adam
[1:00:43] a product
[1:00:46] and took a part of it and made a
[1:00:48] byproduct
[1:00:50] and she was perfect beautiful
[1:00:53] everything wonderful no problem
[1:00:59] all right
[1:01:00] i told him i gave him a couple we don't
[1:01:02] have to jump on i called him to throw in
[1:01:04] quote so
[1:01:06] okay brother
[1:01:08] anderson throw in the quote where you
[1:01:09] got it on
[1:01:11] corinthians book of correction top of
[1:01:13] the page is the one i gave you with no
[1:01:14] number on it
[1:01:15] 1957 414
[1:01:18] paragraph e49 so let's see hey man they
[1:01:22] get good in there you had it it just
[1:01:24] disappeared
[1:01:26] you know
[1:01:27] all right
[1:01:28] they they play with things back there a
[1:01:30] little you know because we're getting
[1:01:32] used to all this stuff
[1:01:33] but look
[1:01:35] read this one very carefully
[1:01:38] at the beginning they were one god when
[1:01:41] he made man he made him a dual person
[1:01:43] both male and female he separated him in
[1:01:46] flesh and put him here on earth and
[1:01:48] flesh
[1:01:49] and the female part was still in spirit
[1:01:53] look
[1:01:54] friends god was so careful
[1:01:58] oh how this don't let it leave you
[1:02:01] god never got a handful of dust and made
[1:02:03] it eve
[1:02:04] she'd have been a different creation
[1:02:07] and she's not a creation
[1:02:10] she's a by-product
[1:02:14] huh
[1:02:15] i don't degrade that
[1:02:18] he's explaining it
[1:02:21] all right
[1:02:23] be a difference he's not a he's
[1:02:25] not a creation she's a by-product and
[1:02:28] god goes over in the heart of adam his
[1:02:30] right hand right out from under his
[1:02:32] heart and takes a rib and makes a wife
[1:02:35] and the very part of adam's spirit was
[1:02:37] in the woman
[1:02:39] and they
[1:02:40] too are one
[1:02:42] soul body spirit
[1:02:49] now you argue with brother around you're
[1:02:51] going to argue with me because i'm going
[1:02:52] to argue me
[1:02:53] i'm going to read
[1:02:56] he said they were one
[1:02:58] body
[1:03:00] soul body and spirit
[1:03:03] okay
[1:03:06] don't look too much like a bad product
[1:03:10] looks like part of adam
[1:03:13] right
[1:03:15] so they're one they're a perfect oneness
[1:03:18] a real woman and a real husband a real
[1:03:21] wife they are one together
[1:03:24] what is it type of christ
[1:03:27] from out of his bosom
[1:03:30] not a by-product now watch what you say
[1:03:33] not a methodist
[1:03:36] now what's he saying
[1:03:41] he's making a by-product they're an
[1:03:42] organization
[1:03:45] right come on read it
[1:03:47] or a badness or a pentecostal hatch up
[1:03:50] no sir but out of his own heart
[1:03:53] he took the sweetheart that's as pure
[1:03:55] and loyal and she can be she's a as
[1:03:59] loyal as a lily
[1:04:01] then he goes to solomon
[1:04:05] while you're there brother
[1:04:08] anderson just drop them down to the
[1:04:09] spoken words original seed and let's get
[1:04:11] one
[1:04:12] beautiful look
[1:04:13] 1962 318 paragraph
[1:04:16] 51
[1:04:19] look what your prophet had to say
[1:04:23] now he gave him a bribe
[1:04:25] atop the second atom
[1:04:28] he gave the first atom of bride she
[1:04:29] failed
[1:04:31] he gave the second adam
[1:04:33] christ a bride
[1:04:35] she failed
[1:04:37] that's exactly why
[1:04:39] she's not an original
[1:04:43] okay
[1:04:44] she's a by-product
[1:04:49] now we're going to get down to where
[1:04:50] you're gonna have to think in a little
[1:04:52] while to what really was the fall
[1:04:56] and why your prophet would make these
[1:04:58] statements
[1:05:01] he said the bride fell
[1:05:06] no no brother brad can't fall well now
[1:05:09] you talk to your prophet
[1:05:12] he said the bride failed
[1:05:14] on that other one he called the
[1:05:16] byproduct to measure just a baptist etc
[1:05:22] now what's he talking about
[1:05:26] he's talking about that
[1:05:30] they could not come back to originality
[1:05:34] no denomination can come back to
[1:05:36] originality
[1:05:40] we've got to come back to the seed
[1:05:44] in christ
[1:05:46] so what's he saying here
[1:05:49] look the bride today is a
[1:05:52] by-product
[1:05:55] oh
[1:05:56] brother now now
[1:05:59] he
[1:06:00] read
[1:06:05] she she calls herself the bride you say
[1:06:07] oh he can talk about the denominations
[1:06:13] until you and i come back
[1:06:17] to the original seed
[1:06:20] we are a byproduct
[1:06:23] a denomination
[1:06:27] now swallow that
[1:06:29] and pray no well bless god we ain't a
[1:06:32] denomination
[1:06:34] what's the difference
[1:06:36] what is a denomination
[1:06:40] well a denomination is a group of people
[1:06:42] got together attacking
[1:06:44] well we've got two souls seventh under
[1:06:45] virtue perusia solomon river jordan i'm
[1:06:48] still stamping and i don't know how many
[1:06:49] stamps they can stamp
[1:06:58] that's why i said it i'm in it
[1:07:01] until the bride of christ comes back to
[1:07:03] the original seed go to masterpiece
[1:07:07] god use them denominations
[1:07:12] go to masterpiece sometime and read it
[1:07:15] and notice where he stops with
[1:07:18] mary
[1:07:19] as a representative of azusa street
[1:07:22] pentecost
[1:07:27] because the word was in mary
[1:07:30] only to the ability to give birth
[1:07:36] he said mary was not the seed i'd ask
[1:07:39] you to get that
[1:07:40] book and read over and over and over
[1:07:44] said mary was not the seed said the seed
[1:07:48] was in mary
[1:07:50] she gave birth to it
[1:07:52] right
[1:07:54] we must give birth to the word
[1:07:56] right
[1:07:58] then we won't be a byproduct
[1:08:02] until we give birth to it we are a
[1:08:04] byproduct
[1:08:06] that's right
[1:08:08] because we're an organization right
[1:08:11] bless god i don't like it i'll turn you
[1:08:13] off goodbye
[1:08:17] come on
[1:08:18] all right
[1:08:19] when you say around here you'll find out
[1:08:21] we believe strong
[1:08:24] in what we believe come and show me
[1:08:25] where i'm wrong
[1:08:27] but you better bring your computer and
[1:08:29] brother brandon with you
[1:08:31] i'm not going to argue with you on
[1:08:32] nothing else
[1:08:34] we're going to see what he had to say
[1:08:35] about it
[1:08:36] see what the bible has to say about it
[1:08:40] but we said but brother daley was just a
[1:08:42] by-product
[1:08:45] all right your signification is what
[1:08:48] upon the basis of what we just brought
[1:08:51] what is a byproduct
[1:08:56] a byproduct simply means
[1:08:59] something taken from the original
[1:09:05] to make another product
[1:09:10] all right
[1:09:13] now
[1:09:16] when we get on down see then you see
[1:09:18] that as sin enters the picture
[1:09:23] surely
[1:09:25] he becomes
[1:09:27] a hybrid
[1:09:32] but now tell me how eve is a hybrid
[1:09:38] god made her
[1:09:39] did he make her a hybrid
[1:09:43] come on
[1:09:45] you better say no
[1:09:48] you didn't make her a hybrid
[1:09:51] right
[1:09:53] you made her right
[1:09:56] she became a hybrid
[1:09:59] because she accepted the wrong seed
[1:10:03] then really she became a high breeder
[1:10:08] there was nothing wrong with these right
[1:10:14] she wasn't made some vulgar form
[1:10:20] you know what her problem was
[1:10:23] she was made beautiful
[1:10:26] and she couldn't handle it
[1:10:31] she couldn't handle it
[1:10:34] no she was made beautiful
[1:10:36] she was co-equal
[1:10:39] got other quotes if you'd like them
[1:10:44] there was only one covenant
[1:10:48] when adam and eve was coequal
[1:10:52] there was only one covenant
[1:10:56] when he sinned
[1:10:59] god made another covenant
[1:11:04] put it up right
[1:11:08] let's go ahead pull up um 194 okay then
[1:11:12] we'll go through that number 95.
[1:11:17] and notice after the beginning after the
[1:11:19] beginning after time began
[1:11:21] back in that was eternity
[1:11:23] is over notice
[1:11:25] after that fall was made by eve after
[1:11:28] the fall there was no need to there was
[1:11:32] need to be another covenant
[1:11:34] now this is going to stumble you
[1:11:36] and he said i'll give you scripture
[1:11:38] god at the beginning made one of a kind
[1:11:40] but now after the fall
[1:11:42] right they didn't say
[1:11:44] he made it wrong after the fall
[1:11:46] we're going beyond the covenant was
[1:11:48] co-equal
[1:11:50] but now after the fall there is another
[1:11:53] covenant made but she was no longer
[1:11:55] ruler with him
[1:11:58] each must have a separate covenant
[1:12:06] what made the two covenants come into
[1:12:08] being
[1:12:10] because of her fault
[1:12:15] because of what happened
[1:12:20] god never made two covenants in the
[1:12:21] beginning
[1:12:25] when he was in adam there was no need of
[1:12:27] two covenants you agree
[1:12:30] when eve was taken from adam
[1:12:33] and placed in a rightful position
[1:12:39] there was no need of two covenants
[1:12:43] she was coequal
[1:12:47] but when she done what she done
[1:12:52] she became to a position no longer
[1:12:54] co-equal
[1:12:57] now listen come on church
[1:12:59] this is the covenants that goes down to
[1:13:01] the polygamies et cetera et cetera et
[1:13:03] cetera i don't have time to explain it
[1:13:06] this is not talking about that a woman
[1:13:08] has one way of salvation a man has
[1:13:10] another there's only one way of
[1:13:11] salvation that's jesus christ don't get
[1:13:14] over on the other side with it
[1:13:16] the two covenants wound up to were
[1:13:21] that he
[1:13:22] wound up with more than one wife
[1:13:26] which she could never have
[1:13:28] but one husband that's
[1:13:30] right he can put her away marriage and
[1:13:33] divorce
[1:13:36] but there's no scripture for a woman to
[1:13:38] ever divorce a man
[1:13:40] period
[1:13:44] that's right mine
[1:13:47] not because that she was
[1:13:52] a bad egg
[1:13:57] but because she let the egg go bad
[1:14:05] two covenants
[1:14:09] look at the next one
[1:14:11] number three
[1:14:12] right record 198
[1:14:14] marriage and divorce
[1:14:18] you talking about the beginning it
[1:14:19] wasn't so we got another covenant now
[1:14:21] it's another covenant now there's a
[1:14:24] there is a covenant for the product
[1:14:31] all right
[1:14:33] and the byproduct
[1:14:37] see now she's developed the wrong thing
[1:14:40] now she is a byproduct
[1:14:43] that is in bad shape
[1:14:48] a covenant for the product
[1:14:52] the male
[1:14:53] the covenant for the right product the
[1:14:55] female
[1:14:57] i didn't write the book
[1:15:03] but i do believe in the straightness of
[1:15:04] the book
[1:15:06] you keep it right
[1:15:11] now
[1:15:13] requiring another covenant
[1:15:20] see
[1:15:21] adam and eve was co-equal one man one
[1:15:23] woman now the woman sinned and what does
[1:15:26] she do that throwed them all to death
[1:15:29] and god had to make a covenant by that
[1:15:31] another covenant here it is right here
[1:15:33] in genesis 3 16.
[1:15:35] he made another covenant all right
[1:15:39] i'll put enmity between thy seed and
[1:15:41] seed of the woman
[1:15:44] now
[1:15:45] by product
[1:15:49] what made the byproduct to be in our
[1:15:51] word or terminologies of what we look at
[1:15:53] it as a bad thing
[1:15:56] with what the by-product done
[1:15:59] will you go along with me
[1:16:02] i said all of that to say one statement
[1:16:04] will you go along with the statement
[1:16:06] that she
[1:16:08] done the wrong
[1:16:13] not that she was made wrong
[1:16:17] not that she was forced into a situation
[1:16:20] that she could not uh resist
[1:16:26] but she was the one that done the wrong
[1:16:31] now we
[1:16:32] get onto the basis of looking at it as
[1:16:35] something that's not right
[1:16:40] but still
[1:16:41] now
[1:16:42] get the whole point
[1:16:48] i know what brother branham says and i
[1:16:50] just quotes there i'll give them to you
[1:16:52] if you want them
[1:16:56] that she was made to where she could
[1:16:58] fall
[1:17:02] now what's he talking about
[1:17:06] he said she was made
[1:17:08] so she could fall
[1:17:13] now
[1:17:15] did god
[1:17:16] make her
[1:17:18] wrong
[1:17:20] that's my point
[1:17:23] if you believe that then there's no need
[1:17:25] to continue under the rest of the story
[1:17:27] if you believe god made her wrong
[1:17:37] she was made perfect
[1:17:44] she started from beauty as number one
[1:17:49] and she began to reason
[1:17:56] no female animal can reason
[1:17:59] you agree
[1:18:01] female animals dog cats whatever
[1:18:04] they don't reason
[1:18:07] she was made with the ability to reason
[1:18:13] you know there's nothing wrong with
[1:18:14] reasoning
[1:18:17] you know the bible says come let us
[1:18:18] reason together
[1:18:20] though your sins will be scarlet
[1:18:21] there'll be white us all right
[1:18:24] there's nothing wrong with reasoning if
[1:18:26] it's in the right way
[1:18:30] reasoning is what helps us in life and
[1:18:33] doings and
[1:18:34] doing better and better jobs and
[1:18:37] you know
[1:18:39] and reasoning upon the word of god right
[1:18:43] no blessed god i don't reason brother
[1:18:44] dale i just take what it says well then
[1:18:50] i'm sorry
[1:18:52] this
[1:18:55] you trying to convince me or yourself
[1:19:01] but what way was she made
[1:19:05] see lucifer was made perfect
[1:19:09] and on one of those quotes if you looked
[1:19:11] them down a little bit while ago is
[1:19:12] underlying
[1:19:14] lucifer at one time was co-equal with
[1:19:16] god
[1:19:19] except for the fact he couldn't create
[1:19:24] what did lucifer fall from
[1:19:27] reasoning
[1:19:29] beauty
[1:19:32] knowledge
[1:19:34] wisdoms
[1:19:36] wanting to know more
[1:19:39] wanting to be looked up to right
[1:19:43] what did he kill leave in the garden
[1:19:46] you be his god
[1:19:53] well you know what that was what she's
[1:19:54] supposed to be
[1:19:58] right
[1:20:01] you know if we believe that he was in
[1:20:03] adam
[1:20:05] and if we believe rhetoric said that she
[1:20:07] was in him in theophany
[1:20:10] right you may not agree with this that's
[1:20:12] all right
[1:20:14] show me where i'm wrong
[1:20:17] adam had eternal life
[1:20:19] what did he have
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:25] see now
[1:20:26] you want to drop down and say now she is
[1:20:28] created a little bit different you know
[1:20:31] she didn't get exactly all of it so that
[1:20:33] made her where she could uh
[1:20:35] now brother branham
[1:20:36] didn't say that right
[1:20:40] that's your thoughts
[1:20:42] sister asked me yesterday said about the
[1:20:44] mormons and the way they believe in them
[1:20:45] they said where did they get that from i
[1:20:47] said sitting down thinking
[1:20:52] amen
[1:20:59] but
[1:21:02] satan took the thing to remember the sin
[1:21:04] in heaven would have to be descent on
[1:21:05] earth and it would have to return in the
[1:21:07] end time
[1:21:12] he was not made a sex pot
[1:21:18] that is the attribute
[1:21:23] agreed
[1:21:26] she wasn't made that she couldn't
[1:21:28] control herself
[1:21:34] if you did you got trouble with god
[1:21:35] making her that way that's right
[1:21:44] you got trouble with god making her
[1:21:47] if you don't let him make her
[1:21:49] in a certain way
[1:21:53] if he does anything whatsoever to make
[1:21:55] her wrong
[1:21:57] in any form
[1:21:58] then other than what he made adam
[1:22:05] you got a
[1:22:08] problem you better remember one thing
[1:22:18] you say adam was perfect i agree
[1:22:25] okay
[1:22:31] but from my understanding of the bible
[1:22:35] even the beast brought
[1:22:37] cain
[1:22:39] adam and eve brought abel
[1:22:44] well you know then adam had the ability
[1:22:49] i don't want to get
[1:22:50] nasty do you follow me
[1:22:55] yeah he was perfect
[1:22:59] hey folks don't run down here to all of
[1:23:02] this stuff i've been asked this you know
[1:23:04] people say okay don't let me go down to
[1:23:06] the this is a point go down to the ymca
[1:23:10] and work out
[1:23:14] so good
[1:23:17] but how come in the ymca i think i've
[1:23:20] been to one
[1:23:21] i just take everybody else's word okay
[1:23:24] but there ain't never a 400 pound woman
[1:23:27] out there showing you how to work
[1:23:28] weights
[1:23:30] in her bikini
[1:23:42] you go in there and man they get them
[1:23:44] pumping and waste this little girl come
[1:23:45] back oh look at it man you're strong
[1:23:50] he goes home dying from pain
[1:23:54] right
[1:23:58] get what i'm talking about
[1:24:02] we look at adam and the beauty and all
[1:24:04] and it was perfect
[1:24:07] but you know he did
[1:24:09] have an act with eve
[1:24:14] you know that god never beat him to
[1:24:16] death about doing that
[1:24:21] you know why
[1:24:24] he was human amen
[1:24:31] don't go down to the honky tonks boys
[1:24:33] think you can testify to them women
[1:24:38] come on
[1:24:40] this gets the point of what i'm talking
[1:24:42] about
[1:24:43] i'm talking about what's the difference
[1:24:44] in adam and eve
[1:24:50] if you make it eve so lustfully sinful
[1:24:53] in her
[1:24:54] desires and her doings until she can't
[1:24:58] control herself
[1:25:02] why didn't adam say
[1:25:05] i don't want you no more
[1:25:10] i'm so holy and pious i can't do that
[1:25:14] but he did
[1:25:17] i ain't never heard nobody preach like
[1:25:18] you i agree with you they've never been
[1:25:20] nobody with me
[1:25:22] like i am
[1:25:24] well i hope it gives you a little
[1:25:26] understanding
[1:25:30] to get away from looking down on women
[1:25:32] and being byproducts you know dog meat
[1:25:35] you big old steak you know
[1:25:38] look at me i didn't fall
[1:25:41] the bible says
[1:25:44] in adam
[1:25:46] all
[1:25:47] die
[1:25:48] amen he never sold the human race
[1:25:53] adam sold the human race
[1:25:57] am i in the bible
[1:26:00] adam had a right to just throw her away
[1:26:02] you say top christ okay fine
[1:26:06] but he had the right to do it and the
[1:26:08] bible told him not to do it
[1:26:10] right
[1:26:13] there's a lot of incidents in the bible
[1:26:15] where that people would take back but
[1:26:16] the bible said don't do it
[1:26:21] you're going to stay in the scripture
[1:26:22] it's going to be plain
[1:26:26] but was he made such a way
[1:26:31] can't you see exactly what happened in
[1:26:33] heaven
[1:26:35] lucifer
[1:26:39] and what started out so simple
[1:26:43] i want things to be prettier that's
[1:26:45] right
[1:26:46] i want it to be beautiful
[1:26:50] i i kind of think maybe that
[1:26:52] that i'm a pretty nice guy
[1:26:58] and it wound up in a battle in heaven
[1:26:59] had to be cast out
[1:27:02] went up in sin right
[1:27:04] what happened in the garden
[1:27:11] it probably took years and years
[1:27:15] to explain to for the beast to explain
[1:27:18] to eve
[1:27:21] the whole situation
[1:27:25] and why would brother branham emphasize
[1:27:27] over and over
[1:27:29] and say she was wrong and said she still
[1:27:33] thinks she's right
[1:27:37] that's right
[1:27:39] come on did he do it
[1:27:41] emphasize it she still thinks he's right
[1:27:47] and she becomes what
[1:27:49] mess of this baptist presbyterian
[1:27:51] brandon mouse
[1:27:53] lula ice
[1:27:55] okay
[1:28:00] you know what the exaltation was i tried
[1:28:02] to explain it the other night and i'm
[1:28:04] sorry i don't have a way and sometimes i
[1:28:05] lose my thought and gotta preach like
[1:28:07] get it back
[1:28:08] but
[1:28:09] it's all right
[1:28:11] what's the problem today
[1:28:14] people come to a church and they don't
[1:28:16] know nothing hardly about you know the
[1:28:20] deeper things of bread around his
[1:28:21] message
[1:28:23] would you let them hang around for a few
[1:28:24] years and first thing you know they
[1:28:26] begin to get hooked into that real good
[1:28:28] and you know what
[1:28:31] they find out they know more than the
[1:28:41] you pastor the one that taught them
[1:28:44] well you know my brother daley is i hope
[1:28:46] you do know more than i do
[1:28:49] that don't bother me
[1:28:52] what bothers me is when people unless
[1:28:53] you get to the big head
[1:28:55] and they won't listen
[1:28:58] because that's what happened in heaven
[1:29:05] that's what happened to eve in the
[1:29:06] garden
[1:29:09] she got to knowing more about it than
[1:29:10] adam
[1:29:13] and you say but now brother dale
[1:29:19] what happened in the garden
[1:29:24] if it was over a period of time
[1:29:29] before the the
[1:29:31] things takes place as we call it
[1:29:34] why didn't adam know all about
[1:29:42] why didn't adam say he leave that based
[1:29:44] alone now
[1:29:50] what took care of it the whole beast and
[1:29:52] eve
[1:29:54] when i tried to explain to you the other
[1:29:56] night
[1:30:01] satan lucifer tried his best to destroy
[1:30:03] michael and michael was the thing that
[1:30:05] stood between him and god to keep him
[1:30:07] from being killed
[1:30:12] there in the garden
[1:30:14] god had to blind adam's eyes
[1:30:18] right looked like he was seeing what was
[1:30:20] going on
[1:30:26] but he didn't see it
[1:30:31] it was all in god's plan to kind of let
[1:30:33] everything just kind of run wouldn't it
[1:30:35] yes
[1:30:36] to give everybody a choice he gave the
[1:30:38] devil a choice he took his choice look
[1:30:40] what he went wrong with it
[1:30:43] and tell me i want to know i mean i'm
[1:30:44] honest i'm sorry i just like to know
[1:30:47] things
[1:30:48] show me the great thing that that
[1:30:50] lucifer done in heaven
[1:30:57] what was the great thing he done
[1:31:00] to get kicked out
[1:31:08] come on
[1:31:09] it's been preached to you but do you
[1:31:10] even see it now what was the great thing
[1:31:12] you've
[1:31:15] he done eat up in his own self
[1:31:19] pride
[1:31:22] look at me
[1:31:24] i'm more beautiful than michael
[1:31:26] that was my job and he took it away from
[1:31:28] me
[1:31:30] just help me and we'll get it back
[1:31:33] what else you're going to say happened
[1:31:34] in heaven
[1:31:36] we done done away with the fact that he
[1:31:38] was committing adultery running around
[1:31:40] and
[1:31:41] all that things were taking place in
[1:31:42] heaven
[1:31:44] because he wouldn't die
[1:31:48] and if it was angels couldn't have done
[1:31:50] it
[1:31:52] but they have no
[1:31:54] ways
[1:31:57] so when he come to even the garden they
[1:31:59] started real slow
[1:32:01] look how beautiful you are
[1:32:05] don't you know eve that they're
[1:32:06] withholding from you the very thing
[1:32:11] you know when she was in adam
[1:32:13] when god said multiply and replenish the
[1:32:15] earth
[1:32:18] agree
[1:32:22] don't you think that some of that would
[1:32:24] be retained when she would be put in her
[1:32:26] own natural being
[1:32:29] especially if she
[1:32:32] was part of adam's soul
[1:32:37] part of his being
[1:32:44] but we think we get it all figured out
[1:32:45] when we think that then adam was
[1:32:47] masculine and feminine we see him on one
[1:32:48] side and he said
[1:32:50] oh you're doing this one animal
[1:32:52] hi animals how you doing
[1:32:58] i don't think anyway i'm sorry
[1:33:08] here regardless of what you think was
[1:33:09] pulled out and put over the other you
[1:33:10] got to remember
[1:33:12] there were one
[1:33:15] that's right two people standing there
[1:33:17] with bodies right right
[1:33:20] but one identity
[1:33:24] her name was adam
[1:33:29] she don't get the name eve until the
[1:33:32] fall transmits that's right
[1:33:36] so the beauty of the things that she had
[1:33:39] the way she was made
[1:33:43] now i'm sorry i just talked plain so if
[1:33:46] you don't like it i'm sorry
[1:33:48] you don't see too many prostitutes that
[1:33:50] weigh 450 pounds
[1:33:55] not blown enough yes
[1:33:57] i'm sorry you don't see that that's
[1:34:00] right
[1:34:01] it's in beauty
[1:34:12] your sisters have your beauty
[1:34:14] but your beauty is your husband
[1:34:26] and why is it you get up and you pretty
[1:34:29] yourself up
[1:34:30] and you really smell good
[1:34:33] and you look good and you dress up just
[1:34:36] go buy groceries
[1:34:44] and the hubby comes in and there you are
[1:34:46] and there it all moves around
[1:34:49] okay
[1:34:53] you get the point
[1:34:58] and it will shock me if i come in one
[1:35:00] day my wife was standing there with a
[1:35:02] you know all dolled up and everything
[1:35:04] and said hi honey i'd say oh wrong house
[1:35:12] well honest
[1:35:15] she does dress up for me though
[1:35:18] i just hope you get the point
[1:35:20] i'm trying to get to you a simple little
[1:35:22] instruction what was the difference in
[1:35:24] adam and eve
[1:35:26] we don't solve one problem
[1:35:29] adam had ever ability
[1:35:31] and produced the ability
[1:35:36] and it says he killed the human rights
[1:35:42] he said brother daley never heard nobody
[1:35:44] talk like him i agree with you
[1:35:46] but is it the truth yes
[1:35:49] that's right
[1:35:51] but eve got in her beauty
[1:35:54] i know be glad to get them to you
[1:35:57] lord around said she was made that way
[1:36:04] he said she was made beautiful
[1:36:07] how did he
[1:36:08] know
[1:36:10] i'd run around but i loved it
[1:36:12] because i believe him
[1:36:14] he said there stood adam said he wasn't
[1:36:16] a great big masculine thing looking like
[1:36:18] a big city just kind of wasn't a guy
[1:36:20] problem maybe you know
[1:36:24] but he said understood if i get it wrong
[1:36:26] y'all correct what
[1:36:27] blond-headed blue-eyed
[1:36:32] beautiful
[1:36:35] he said i see all these pictures they
[1:36:37] draw and said makes it look so weird but
[1:36:40] he said no said she was the prettiest
[1:36:42] woman
[1:36:48] and you know what
[1:36:50] how many quotes you want
[1:36:52] that was her curse
[1:36:56] you want tim
[1:36:58] told you i don't bring everything you
[1:36:59] think i'd pray a lot but
[1:37:02] that was her curse
[1:37:05] the curse of making her beautiful
[1:37:10] to make her
[1:37:12] to give her to adam
[1:37:17] god didn't want to give adam an ugly
[1:37:18] woman
[1:37:22] he doesn't want an ugly woman i ain't
[1:37:24] talking about
[1:37:25] when you got run over by a truck you
[1:37:26] can't have it
[1:37:32] you know what i mean by that that's an
[1:37:34] old joke among us
[1:37:36] we're a bunch of we're just ugly
[1:37:40] but beauty is beauty
[1:37:44] i look at you girls and i see you
[1:37:48] i think oh god what if it would be for a
[1:37:50] world full of people
[1:37:51] the word that you see the sisters that
[1:37:53] are really dressed nice and you know not
[1:37:55] showing yourself to the world
[1:37:57] why would you want to show yourself to
[1:37:58] the world
[1:38:02] why would you want to unveil your body
[1:38:04] and show it to the world
[1:38:10] not realizing you're going to pay for
[1:38:11] commitment adultery
[1:38:15] but why wouldn't you want to have your
[1:38:17] beauty to your husband and your husband
[1:38:19] only
[1:38:23] see if he would have stayed right look
[1:38:24] what it would have been
[1:38:27] lucifer to stay right look what it would
[1:38:29] have been
[1:38:35] but eve was made
[1:38:41] and given a
[1:38:42] beautiful being of herself
[1:38:48] and satan says don't you realize that's
[1:38:49] what you're made for
[1:38:51] i've preached to you what 40 years and
[1:38:53] you know what i'm fixing to say what i
[1:38:54] preach for 40 years
[1:38:57] satan was trying to tell eve that she
[1:38:59] was
[1:39:00] going to bring forth
[1:39:03] the product
[1:39:05] that god wanted rob
[1:39:09] i've always believed that
[1:39:11] she believed she was going to bring
[1:39:13] forth what god had said multiply and
[1:39:16] replenish the earth
[1:39:21] she was trying to help god
[1:39:25] just as sarah was trying to help god
[1:39:28] when she gave hagar to abraham
[1:39:38] her beauty was her curse
[1:39:45] she wasn't made as i said to be all
[1:39:49] lustful
[1:39:56] you look beautiful
[1:40:02] she had to be
[1:40:06] brought into a place
[1:40:09] and that had to be through her spiritual
[1:40:11] being
[1:40:14] in their spiritual beings she began to
[1:40:15] accept satan's lie
[1:40:17] right
[1:40:18] and then things started happening
[1:40:25] then the beast could say look at the
[1:40:26] animals they are reproducing
[1:40:29] that's what you made for
[1:40:34] but at that time the animals were
[1:40:35] reproducing
[1:40:39] look what they're doing
[1:40:41] they're multiplying replenishing the
[1:40:43] earth
[1:40:44] because that's what you're money for
[1:40:47] brother brown said the mind things she
[1:40:49] done she mixed her seed
[1:40:52] she couldn't wait
[1:40:54] well where's original seed he said
[1:40:57] the church can't wait
[1:41:01] you look around this message people
[1:41:05] and you see
[1:41:07] that they can't wait
[1:41:10] they gotta have something tantalizing
[1:41:11] something going something running some
[1:41:14] way
[1:41:15] some new thing
[1:41:25] now brother brown said the way that the
[1:41:27] woman was made with one thing and i'll
[1:41:28] end with
[1:41:30] he said she was made to be able to
[1:41:32] receive
[1:41:34] at any time
[1:41:37] a male
[1:41:39] said whereas the animals
[1:41:42] you look at a line
[1:41:45] but he's mean and tough
[1:41:48] but he will not touch that female
[1:41:53] until she's ready
[1:41:56] because he knows he's going to have some
[1:41:58] scars on his
[1:42:12] he said she was made to work
[1:42:14] she could receive a mail at any time
[1:42:18] now
[1:42:25] i've been not going away i think a lot
[1:42:27] of times but
[1:42:30] i was going to say part of it what's
[1:42:33] wrong with a man and wife being husband
[1:42:34] and wife and living together
[1:42:38] now you understand my point
[1:42:39] everybody know what i'm talking about
[1:42:42] what's wrong with that
[1:42:45] nothing
[1:42:52] so was she made
[1:42:54] in a bad way
[1:43:01] but her beauty her desire of knowledge
[1:43:04] her all kind of things took her to a
[1:43:06] place that she eventually done the wrong
[1:43:08] thing
[1:43:13] no
[1:43:15] right act with the wrong person as you
[1:43:17] say
[1:43:21] she didn't become a hybrid
[1:43:24] for a high breeder
[1:43:28] because that's what she done she bred
[1:43:30] the animal race
[1:43:32] to the human race
[1:43:36] and then you can think all you want to
[1:43:38] of how holy and pious and lovely you are
[1:43:41] you ain't nothing but a
[1:43:44] hybrid that's right
[1:43:49] every human being in the world
[1:43:52] except jesus christ
[1:43:56] prophet priest king or who
[1:44:00] is a hybrid
[1:44:02] you want those quotes brother branham
[1:44:04] said i'm a hybrid
[1:44:09] because you see
[1:44:11] the byproduct
[1:44:14] that should have been that brother
[1:44:15] maloney said actually the word foreign
[1:44:17] and i don't know this in the greek i'm
[1:44:19] just quoting him
[1:44:21] sounds good
[1:44:22] he said in the greek that really
[1:44:25] eve was signifying as being
[1:44:28] a womb of wounds w-o-m-b one you know
[1:44:35] to reproduce the man
[1:44:40] that's how close it is
[1:44:44] she's given to reproduce man
[1:44:48] her problem was she refused to reproduce
[1:44:50] an animal in man
[1:44:53] because we know what happened in the
[1:44:54] garden
[1:45:00] you ever noticed then that god didn't
[1:45:01] curse adam
[1:45:03] you want the quote
[1:45:07] god didn't curse he you want the quote
[1:45:16] he cursed the animal
[1:45:18] because now the animal must be the
[1:45:21] sacrifice
[1:45:22] that's right
[1:45:24] because he said the animal calls to fall
[1:45:28] now it must be accepted as a sacrifice
[1:45:33] so then you started making your
[1:45:35] sacrifices of animals until jesus came
[1:45:41] a lot of people don't read enough to
[1:45:43] know what read around and say it
[1:45:47] but what about it
[1:45:49] you sisters you have the most wonderful
[1:45:51] opportunity in the world
[1:45:57] hold yourself
[1:46:01] keep yourself pure
[1:46:06] why won't you even want to
[1:46:08] go in and show your body
[1:46:14] why would you have any desires
[1:46:16] whatsoever
[1:46:17] as to anyone else besides your husband
[1:46:20] and i'll say say that brothers why would
[1:46:21] you
[1:46:24] because remember i just got through
[1:46:26] proving the point that you may not like
[1:46:28] a lot of people here that won't like it
[1:46:30] at all but you know adam had a part to
[1:46:32] do with this thing
[1:46:36] because he had a choice
[1:46:41] now let's don't go too far okay
[1:46:48] because there is doctrines among the
[1:46:50] people of the message that said
[1:46:52] adam grabbed eve and planted his seed
[1:46:55] within her to save her
[1:46:58] now you
[1:46:59] brother gary what was that you used to
[1:47:01] tell me about them when y'all live down
[1:47:03] on the 10th street
[1:47:05] you know
[1:47:06] the hippie movement
[1:47:08] free love
[1:47:17] if sex is what kept eve from being
[1:47:19] destroyed then what's wrong with it
[1:47:27] no no no come on
[1:47:30] sex didn't keep me from being destroyed
[1:47:33] sex was the
[1:47:34] original and then they'll take julian
[1:47:36] and tamar and they bring it over and
[1:47:38] they try to bring out these beautiful
[1:47:39] things
[1:47:41] and they show that
[1:47:43] tamar took
[1:47:45] you know
[1:47:46] judah took tamar planted his seed to
[1:47:49] savor
[1:47:51] let me quote brother branham
[1:47:53] i don't see
[1:47:56] how that adultery can be a predestinated
[1:48:00] seed
[1:48:01] quote
[1:48:06] brother there where does that leave me
[1:48:08] because i'm not
[1:48:09] don't worry about it because ain't none
[1:48:11] of us in this building original season
[1:48:13] naturally
[1:48:18] i don't care what you think your family
[1:48:19] come from
[1:48:21] what tree you come off of
[1:48:25] all the human race is a garbage can
[1:48:30] was run around saying that an
[1:48:31] illegitimate child
[1:48:33] he said i don't see how the illegitimate
[1:48:34] child can go into rapture
[1:48:39] you see why people want to quote but
[1:48:41] they don't answer the quote
[1:48:44] every one of us in this building was
[1:48:46] born from an adulterous act right oh no
[1:48:48] no my mom and dad was married well what
[1:48:50] about grandma grandpa what about grandpa
[1:48:52] grandpa grandpa grandpa grandpa
[1:48:57] don't remember the
[1:48:58] bibles this is bad for one's other
[1:49:02] that's right
[1:49:05] what's brother brown saying
[1:49:08] an illegitimate child is not a
[1:49:10] predestinated seed
[1:49:13] because he talked about the seed of
[1:49:14] natural things
[1:49:19] because if you get born again
[1:49:21] you're not illegitimate anymore
[1:49:24] and if i was bastard born from 40
[1:49:27] generations
[1:49:28] and you could prove my dna went straight
[1:49:31] back to cain
[1:49:33] i would still stand here today and say
[1:49:35] jesus christ has saved me
[1:49:43] no sex act didn't save me
[1:49:46] a creation
[1:49:47] to come into being all right
[1:49:50] to take my place and pay my price
[1:50:07] my child going into rapture no but all
[1:50:09] babies go to heaven so what are you
[1:50:10] worried about that's right
[1:50:13] from the time we go into rapture it's
[1:50:14] only three and a half years
[1:50:17] maybe you can't believe it three and a
[1:50:18] half years old so don't worry about it
[1:50:20] but it's not going in the rapture with
[1:50:22] you
[1:50:23] because like i've always told you
[1:50:27] you have a child today and rapture takes
[1:50:29] place tomorrow that baby's going with
[1:50:31] you if mom and daddy are going
[1:50:35] i believe that because i believe in in
[1:50:38] jesus christ
[1:50:41] being a savior
[1:50:43] a redeemer
[1:50:46] he come to redeem you and i from those
[1:50:49] things that we thought were our ideas
[1:50:51] and that's the main sin that we have
[1:50:55] is our concept or thoughts of what we
[1:50:57] believe
[1:50:58] because mama told me grandma told me
[1:51:00] grandpa told me
[1:51:04] he said we're laying in the bible yes it
[1:51:06] is
[1:51:08] people are getting just upset with you
[1:51:10] because you tell them it's not in the
[1:51:11] bible
[1:51:13] mom told me what
[1:51:16] i don't want to call mama liar i just
[1:51:18] say mama didn't read it right
[1:51:21] that's right
[1:51:23] my mama your mama who it was
[1:51:26] they just didn't read it right
[1:51:31] because we're down here remember we're
[1:51:33] here where it can be brought into being
[1:51:35] now the thing that was in heaven that
[1:51:37] was unbelief
[1:51:39] and the thing that happened in the
[1:51:40] garden
[1:51:43] now why is it that you see around this
[1:51:45] message
[1:51:46] that is turning to beautiful buildings
[1:51:48] and beautiful congregations
[1:51:52] sorry
[1:51:54] not jealous i don't want 700 i'd wear my
[1:51:57] arm out
[1:52:00] because you know yourself when i go
[1:52:01] outside i shake hands with everybody
[1:52:03] you don't shake hands with me today
[1:52:04] it'll be your fault you won't hang
[1:52:06] around long enough
[1:52:08] if i had 700 i'd shake hands with 700.
[1:52:12] i know jealousy of all these people we
[1:52:14] could have that we could have a brand
[1:52:15] new building
[1:52:18] but instead of that we try to put it
[1:52:19] back in for the work of the lord
[1:52:31] okay i'm tickled but we really work good
[1:52:33] around here
[1:52:35] we look at the video sometimes when we
[1:52:37] see we did that
[1:52:38] the things here at sure oh yeah we got a
[1:52:41] little small
[1:52:42] 700 camera or something maybe i don't
[1:52:44] know what it was sitting over here and
[1:52:46] the man sitting on the still haven't
[1:52:47] operated don't even have automatic
[1:52:48] controls
[1:52:50] and we have a small place up here to the
[1:52:53] to the musicians have to play in harmony
[1:52:56] because if the film goes up
[1:52:58] the horn's got to go down they have
[1:53:00] enough room to breathe
[1:53:04] i need a lot about beauty around here
[1:53:07] but you know i love it
[1:53:10] i love her music
[1:53:13] i love people
[1:53:17] because we're trying the same thing
[1:53:20] we're trying
[1:53:21] amen trying to get rid of what he let
[1:53:24] get in her way
[1:53:28] oh look how y'all look at lulu got all
