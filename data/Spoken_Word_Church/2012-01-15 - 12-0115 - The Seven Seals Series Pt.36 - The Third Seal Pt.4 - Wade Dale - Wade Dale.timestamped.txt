[4:46] big enough
[4:48] no not a box big enough all right well
[4:52] this another thing is coming up that's
[4:54] really important that that
[4:56] um I feel important to us
[4:58] is I know that um at the time is we we
[5:02] always say the time's near the times at
[5:04] hand you know for the for the catching
[5:06] away in the bride and I believe it but
[5:08] you know brother random said if you were
[5:09] building a house he should continue
[5:10] building it even if you know the Lord
[5:12] was coming tomorrow right
[5:14] plant potatoes go ahead and plant them
[5:16] today if you even know the Lord's going
[5:18] to come tomorrow
[5:20] so if you and I went through this
[5:21] Financial Peace University class given
[5:23] by Dave Ramsey last year and if it
[5:26] wasn't for that class when I went from a
[5:28] thousand dollars a week to 600 a week we
[5:31] would have been in trouble
[5:32] but being that we went through this
[5:34] class we
[5:36] didn't miss a lake I mean we didn't miss
[5:38] anything we already had everything set
[5:40] up for it and you say well
[5:43] you ought to be able to do it without
[5:44] coming to the class remember we're sheep
[5:47] why we got deacons we don't need deacons
[5:49] if everybody's got the Holy Ghost and
[5:50] everybody will act right we don't need
[5:52] deacons but we got deacons in the church
[5:53] right we don't need preachers God said
[5:55] he'd talk to us individually but no you
[5:57] got to have them because we're sheep we
[5:59] have to be led all right we have to be
[6:01] told what to do when you like it or not
[6:03] we have to be told what to do and you
[6:05] know somebody can beat it in you but a
[6:06] lot of times you know they can try to
[6:08] beat it in you but unless you really see
[6:10] it on paper I was telling Richard this
[6:13] morning that June and I we went through
[6:15] this class back in February and it's a
[6:17] commitment it's a committal class
[6:18] because you've got to come 13 weeks
[6:21] straight can't miss but one
[6:24] one lesson
[6:26] congratulations
[6:30] you got to physically go for it
[6:33] and where Keller Williams has been
[6:36] generous to let us borrow their room
[6:39] up in Gainesville which is a more
[6:41] central location
[6:43] uh to have it here we've had to put up a
[6:45] screen because a lot of us caught on DVD
[6:47] by Dave himself
[6:49] we'd had to do it in the sanctuary and I
[6:51] don't have a problem with doing it in
[6:52] sanctuary but
[6:54] we need to leave money matters you know
[6:56] as individuals maybe do it we had a big
[6:59] place down here we could have done it
[7:00] but
[7:01] Keller Williams through sister Rebecca
[7:04] and sister uh
[7:08] are gracious enough to let us have it
[7:10] and we we're going to open it to anyone
[7:13] you'll see posters and like I said on
[7:15] Richard he said well what's the cost
[7:17] well it doesn't cost you anything to
[7:18] come to the first preview which is going
[7:20] to be on February the 23rd that's on
[7:21] Thursday
[7:23] he said why why Thursday well if you're
[7:26] going to be committed you'll come if you
[7:27] don't you won't I mean that's just the
[7:28] way it is we we didn't miss a course I
[7:31] missed one because I had preaching no
[7:33] brother just died
[7:34] but just died February the 14th last
[7:37] year
[7:38] and I went to the funeral and I missed
[7:40] one of the classes on Friday
[7:42] but if we have them on Thursday from 7
[7:44] to 9 at Keller Williams some of you may
[7:46] not be able to attend which is fine I
[7:47] mean it's okay
[7:49] but we'll be teaching a Financial Peace
[7:51] University class it is a faith-based it
[7:54] is not a get rich quick scheme it's not
[7:56] something you're going to probably like
[7:59] we didn't like it at first but then it
[8:01] became fun didn't it okay I mean it's
[8:03] fine now uh and it's one thing mama
[8:06] always taught us she always said you
[8:08] know you need this not spend your money
[8:10] before you get it
[8:11] well that's okay that's old that's old
[8:13] school
[8:14] Now Dave teaches that you spend your
[8:16] money before you get it
[8:18] it works out much better to spend your
[8:20] money before you get it than it is after
[8:23] you get it
[8:24] because
[8:26] your money has to have a name
[8:30] you say well I'm going to make 600 this
[8:32] week all right well you know you have
[8:33] 600 you should take a whole month and
[8:36] you spread it out in a whole year and
[8:37] you spread this thing out and you put
[8:39] them in envelopes and we'll we'll uh I
[8:41] don't spend much time on it but I just
[8:42] want to kind of give you something to
[8:44] good luck at brother Dale said it was
[8:46] okay for us to do it so it's it's fine
[8:49] to uh
[8:50] to try to do this because you know it's
[8:52] we still got to live in this world
[8:55] and whether we like it or not we got to
[8:57] make money until they take it all away
[8:59] from us
[9:00] we got to make money to survive
[9:03] and we have learned to be able to give
[9:06] more we got to be able to save more
[9:09] uh you'll see if you take the course
[9:12] that out in the in the world of of the
[9:15] Evangelical Christians only three
[9:17] percent of the people tied now that
[9:19] don't happen in this church probably 97
[9:21] percent of the people kind of in this
[9:23] church are 90 should be it should be 100
[9:25] I don't know why it isn't because you're
[9:27] robbing yourself of a blessing not God
[9:29] God doesn't need your money
[9:31] God can do with ten percent what we
[9:33] can't do with 90. that's right right and
[9:35] he never has looked at the stock market
[9:37] to see no he's always had something in
[9:40] place to uh to uh to take care of his uh
[9:43] economy because we're not building a
[9:45] kingdom down here but it is a lot easier
[9:47] that if you hit a financial crunch
[9:49] to be able to say hey I got something to
[9:51] fall back on hey we got a little money
[9:53] put together here or
[9:55] like Terrence and I were talking the
[9:57] other day he said well you know what
[9:59] he said all these people that that
[10:01] rented houses I'm talking about message
[10:02] people it's renting houses and done all
[10:04] this stuff and took their kids out of
[10:05] school and worked hard for a living they
[10:07] come down to the old age and they don't
[10:09] have nothing because they thought the
[10:10] Rapture was going to take place so we're
[10:12] not going to put any money up
[10:13] not only smart to start putting money up
[10:15] it doesn't matter if you know God's
[10:16] coming tomorrow
[10:19] because what if he don't come in 10 more
[10:21] years a lot of us are going to be in our
[10:22] 60s
[10:24] all right so I'm in there 70s
[10:29] think about that online you'll be 70
[10:31] years old
[10:35] but anyway if you want to come that's
[10:36] fine we may teach one later on in the
[10:39] year down toward Commerce because some
[10:41] of those down there want us to uh to do
[10:43] one down there but it's really fun it's
[10:46] it's something that it only takes two
[10:48] hours of your time a week and you know
[10:50] we sit around and go on the internet and
[10:52] do things like that
[10:53] and it is I wouldn't do it if it wasn't
[10:56] Christian based he doesn't have any
[10:57] off-colored jokes or say he's really um
[11:00] to be a nominal Christian I guess he's
[11:01] probably one of the best ones you can
[11:03] you can get if you listen to the radio
[11:04] program he has radio programs all over
[11:07] the country
[11:08] he does not want you to become Filthy
[11:11] Rich he just wants you to be able to
[11:12] live
[11:13] be able to live through life and do
[11:14] things and but on February the 23rd
[11:17] we're going to have a preview session at
[11:19] Keller Williams at seven o'clock then
[11:22] the classes start March the 1st and they
[11:24] end the week before
[11:26] May of the uh
[11:29] Memorial Day weekend
[11:31] which June and I will be going to
[11:32] Wichita during that weekend so I'm glad
[11:34] it ends at that time but it's a 13-week
[11:37] course like I was telling Richard
[11:40] you can believe this or not we when we
[11:43] started the course the kits are 100.
[11:46] to get the kids you get a lifetime
[11:48] membership you get all these resources
[11:50] from his website
[11:52] and also it teaches you the average
[11:55] person that takes this class
[11:58] is pays off 2700 2700 worth of debt
[12:04] and save a thousand dollars
[12:07] you're in that 13 week so it's a pretty
[12:09] good investment June and I of course I
[12:11] was making money then you know making
[12:13] the the thousand dollars a week then and
[12:15] we were doing fine we paid off 6 500 in
[12:18] debt in 13 weeks
[12:21] and we saved a thousand dollars for our
[12:25] emergency fund just in 13 weeks not by
[12:28] collecting any other income I think the
[12:30] only big thing we've done I sold a four
[12:31] wheeler
[12:33] to a Boyden
[12:35] and whatever that tall guy's name is
[12:37] early
[12:38] so
[12:39] it's a good thing Dave teaches the class
[12:41] yeah
[12:42] but but it's fine it's just something
[12:44] you know that it's something to do
[12:46] that's not wasteful the time's not
[12:47] wasteful so it's an investment just
[12:49] think about it and it's productive and
[12:51] it is but it's a commitment you say well
[12:53] I don't know about 13 weeks well you
[12:54] know you may not do the course either
[12:56] because June and I are still doing
[12:58] you know I don't agree with every
[13:00] principle the man has
[13:02] but if I agree with 90 of them then I
[13:04] can apply that 90 to what I'm doing and
[13:07] it makes me 90 better
[13:09] all right so and it's really not for
[13:11] everybody but you know what there's
[13:13] there was a lady in our class that was a
[13:14] single mom had two kids she was
[13:17] struggling bad
[13:19] and she got better in that 13 weeks you
[13:21] didn't pay off 6 500 worth of debt but
[13:23] she paid off some debt and she had a
[13:26] thousand dollar emergency fund within
[13:27] that 13 weeks didn't do anything
[13:29] different she just changed her uh
[13:31] attitude toward
[13:33] how she keeps her money all right so
[13:35] remember that just for your information
[13:37] we'll have posters up here sister
[13:40] Rebecca is going to take some to Keller
[13:41] Williams we're going to post it on the
[13:43] website and uh if anybody wants to
[13:45] attend they sure can well let's try to
[13:48] chapter six let's finish with the third
[13:49] seal I want to finish it up today and
[13:52] get it get it complete now everybody
[13:54] remember the banquet coming up is on
[13:56] what the 18th
[13:58] I gotta get these out of the way the
[13:59] 18th the 11th is the Youth Camp
[14:04] Lord willing in March the 23rd through
[14:08] the 26th or 27th June and I are going to
[14:11] be at Ron Spencer's
[14:13] for a little time of rest and relaxation
[14:19] and have a meeting that weekend so just
[14:21] be
[14:22] keep us in the prayer
[14:24] and like I said we'll be at brother
[14:26] Dutch God's at the end of this end of
[14:28] this month so just remember us
[14:33] chapter six
[14:36] and when it opened the third seal verse
[14:38] five and when you opened the third seal
[14:39] I heard the third Beach they come and
[14:41] see and I'll be held a little black
[14:42] horse and he that sat on him had a pair
[14:44] of balances in his hand I Heard a Voice
[14:46] in the midst of the four beats they a
[14:48] measure of wheat for opinion three
[14:49] measures of barley for a penny see thou
[14:51] hurt not the oil
[14:54] and the wine now let's turn over to
[14:56] Matthew
[14:58] 24.
[15:09] verse seven
[15:12] so remember verse 5 would be your first
[15:15] steal verse 6 would be your second seal
[15:17] verse seven and eight would be your
[15:21] third seal for nation Nation shall rise
[15:24] against nation and Kingdom against
[15:26] Kingdom and there shall be famines and
[15:28] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[15:30] places all these are the beginning of
[15:32] Sorrows I don't know if you read the
[15:34] paper this morning
[15:35] or looked on the internet but it's kind
[15:37] of a striking thing that that
[15:39] earthquakes and divers places there was
[15:40] earthquake in Ohio the other day
[15:43] that they said was caused because
[15:44] they're going after natural gas so they
[15:46] call it fracturing or fracking and what
[15:49] they go in is they go in and they
[15:51] actually blast at an angle through a
[15:53] rock
[15:55] to get to that natural gas and what it's
[15:57] doing is when you do it at an angle what
[15:59] happens if there's anything underneath
[16:01] there that that don't need to be there
[16:03] or some kind of hole what happened
[16:05] that's what an earthquake is
[16:07] moving of the ground
[16:09] so this morning out in Oregon they're
[16:12] actually drilling into a volcano and
[16:15] going to press water into that volcano
[16:18] could create geothermal steam at the top
[16:21] of the volcano where they've got a
[16:23] turbine and they're going to try to
[16:24] generate power that way
[16:26] as I said that people were concerned
[16:28] that if you push water down in there
[16:30] what's going to happen they don't have a
[16:32] clue so
[16:34] man is really my point is man is really
[16:37] earthquakes don't have to just be that
[16:39] the Earth is moving man's doing a lot of
[16:42] things think of all the oil we take out
[16:43] on the ground why do you think there's
[16:44] sinkholes in Florida
[16:46] we're taking all the groundwater up out
[16:48] of the out of the soil and guess what
[16:51] it just falls down so man is one that's
[16:53] destroying ourselves
[16:55] Nation shall rise against Nations see
[16:57] that's man nation is not what is Israel
[17:01] what is Russia it's the people right all
[17:04] right same way with hearing Kingdom
[17:06] Satan's kingdom against God's Kingdom
[17:09] but see he made a promise in this third
[17:12] uh seal that ceases do not hurt the oil
[17:14] and wine so he's going to protect the
[17:16] group of people we said they showed
[17:19] entire that this is the baptism of the
[17:21] Holy Ghost the third seal right
[17:24] and then we see that the pair of
[17:26] balances that the Catholic church was
[17:28] charging for no business
[17:30] Wheaton of barley was the staff of life
[17:33] and the black horse was denomination
[17:35] their death that was set up in the fifth
[17:37] and sixth Church age
[17:38] because of denominational ideas
[17:43] because the the first seal you saw that
[17:45] Antichrist Spirit there was people
[17:47] talking about things then you see it
[17:49] come a little bit closer become a false
[17:51] prophet and then we got the Beast coming
[17:54] up here
[17:55] and what's that happened this this
[17:57] denominational idea
[18:00] has now moved over into what we call the
[18:03] bride it's not out there anymore it's in
[18:07] here the denomination brother Daniel's
[18:08] been preaching a long time our own
[18:11] denominational ideas is what's killing
[18:13] us
[18:14] well this is what I think it is stop
[18:17] this is what I think it is stop and you
[18:20] see many preachers across the land
[18:22] preaching false Doctrine well what is
[18:24] that that's a denomination that's not
[18:26] God God Don't Preach false doctors man
[18:29] preaches false doctor so as the Black
[18:32] Death the black horse comes riding in
[18:37] which is the Blackness of death also we
[18:40] got to see that like what brother Dale's
[18:42] been preaching that you can't condemn a
[18:44] dead man
[18:45] my damn man can't sin
[18:48] you're dead
[18:49] can't stand can't do anything wrong we
[18:52] covered that before in this but as all
[18:55] the nations are rising against nation
[18:56] and all the doctrines against doctrines
[18:59] we see that all these things are the
[19:01] beginning of Sorrows verse 8 look that's
[19:03] what's happening
[19:05] all these are the beginning of Sorrow
[19:07] now we know for a fact excuse me a fact
[19:10] that these seals are going to open in
[19:12] their natural form and have open in
[19:15] their natural form and let's clear
[19:17] something up
[19:18] I think I maybe mentioning it before but
[19:21] in the seals
[19:23] you can see that the seals are not open
[19:26] hold on and you can see that the seals
[19:29] are open because if you don't have a
[19:30] revelation they're not open
[19:32] okay so where brother Brown says well
[19:35] the seventh seal has not been Vindicated
[19:36] yet on this episode not been revealed
[19:38] yet that's true but he says the seventh
[19:41] seal has been open
[19:43] Jesus opened six of them right here
[19:46] and then he was the seventh that that
[19:48] you had to know him
[19:50] his own people didn't even know it but
[19:53] to see on the day of Pentecost that man
[19:55] was revealed in a portion to that group
[19:57] of 120 in the upper room and that sealed
[19:59] them in so the seals are open it's an
[20:04] open book you don't ever see a closed
[20:06] book you see open book all right same
[20:09] way with you and I and then during all
[20:10] this time of of enrollment I mean in
[20:13] yeah in Romans and all that talking
[20:15] about adoption that's what leads us up
[20:17] we've got to be able to know
[20:20] that that man we got to have the
[20:22] intelligence of the real man who Jesus
[20:25] Christ he was the only man that real
[20:27] I guess you might say the whole package
[20:30] deal he was the greatest man that ever
[20:32] walked on the face here he said well he
[20:33] was God he was man also
[20:36] but he was God man right right he was a
[20:39] great he was the Fulfillment of what God
[20:41] wanted in the Garden of Eden that's
[20:42] right
[20:43] right
[20:45] but it's the shrewness of this combat
[20:47] Beast is coming in and we've got to have
[20:49] the shrewness of God Amen the knowledge
[20:52] it's not bad to have knowledge see right
[20:54] there on a pyramid have knowledge
[20:56] what not not not not not
[20:59] how to you know do calculus or trick no
[21:02] we need the knowledge to know that when
[21:04] this comes
[21:06] we cast it out that's right
[21:08] that's why brother Brown will say here
[21:10] stands the Lamb with a book in his hand
[21:11] and there goes the white horse rider
[21:12] well see here stands the land with a
[21:14] book in his hand there goes the rainbow
[21:15] shark here stands the land with a book
[21:16] in his hand there goes to black horse
[21:17] rider you got to see that opposition
[21:19] riding away from your
[21:24] ideas
[21:27] you gotta see that that's why these
[21:29] seals are so important for the
[21:31] Redemption of this body
[21:35] to be real honest with you
[21:37] you don't need the seals to be a
[21:39] born-again Christian
[21:43] well
[21:48] um FM Bosworth didn't have the seal
[21:52] and the form that we're looking at now
[21:54] sure everybody's read them and
[21:56] everybody's commented on them and made
[21:57] commentary but there's going to be a lot
[21:59] of people but see they never made the
[22:00] change of the body they had never had
[22:03] somebody come on the scene to explain
[22:04] and say hey this is important
[22:07] this has got to be understood you've got
[22:10] to see this opposition riding away from
[22:13] you because in all actuality Luther
[22:15] Luther didn't see this
[22:18] because he still took on he didn't take
[22:21] on denomination he was not a
[22:22] denomination but he took on that
[22:24] father-son Holy Ghost baptism which was
[22:26] that horse still riding but God winked
[22:29] at that and said hey I know you don't
[22:31] need to understand that you can't
[22:32] understand it but I've got to put it in
[22:34] my Bible they are in my word so that
[22:38] we can take a body change and therefore
[22:41] we take a body change everybody behind
[22:43] us
[22:44] I hope you understood that in
[22:45] Revelations when we're reading
[22:46] Revelations 8 a long time ago
[22:49] it says the whole creation is groaning
[22:51] and waiting well that's not just the
[22:53] dogs and the cats and the trees
[22:56] that's the people that's going on
[22:59] right that's the people that's going on
[23:01] they were in Ukraine they were Creek New
[23:03] Creation if they were born again they're
[23:05] dead waiting on us
[23:07] so they grown and wait
[23:09] how long how long but not to have been
[23:11] into our blood but how long how long in
[23:12] that dimension
[23:14] they told Brother grandma if you had to
[23:16] come but the angel said hey you're going
[23:18] to go back to Earth with this group of
[23:19] people because they're not complaining
[23:21] they don't have their human bodies
[23:25] good yeah I thought I needed
[23:29] the regulation of the seals only to get
[23:33] out of here and FF boss was of another
[23:36] age
[23:38] he is in another age but he had the new
[23:39] birth without understanding the sales
[23:43] that's what I said
[23:46] no but I am required to have this
[23:49] Revelation right
[23:51] he was not required but what I said was
[23:54] he didn't maybe I didn't say to clear
[23:56] them
[23:57] you can have the new birth and not have
[23:59] the revelation of these seals because a
[24:02] new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[24:04] Christ which is the seals but in part
[24:06] that's right in cars right okay in part
[24:09] A lot of those people brother Brown were
[24:11] preaching to were born again Christians
[24:13] and he said it's gone from you you're
[24:15] not going to get it that didn't mean
[24:16] that everyone was going to hell no right
[24:18] but they were just not to the ability to
[24:21] understand this at the time and enough
[24:24] with the Holy Ghost teaching I said holy
[24:26] ghost teaching they had enough of the
[24:28] Holy Ghost to get them in the body they
[24:30] just didn't have enough Holy Ghost
[24:31] teaching to open that book completely
[24:34] and say hey I got enough for this guy to
[24:36] be changed now not just the one inside
[24:38] of me I got enough of this so I'm not
[24:40] saying that they didn't have the Holy
[24:41] Ghost I'm saying that they can you can
[24:43] have the Holy Ghost and I don't
[24:45] understand the seals but
[24:46] in this age it's required that if you
[24:48] get the Holy Ghost it'll lead you into
[24:50] all truth which is this right here
[24:53] most of them die are all of them died
[24:56] all of them all of them died that's the
[24:59] whole case they have the whole case they
[25:01] even the ones that died from from uh
[25:04] what today's 15th from February the 15th
[25:07] 2002 from their back they did not get
[25:11] the total revelation of these seals
[25:13] because they died true total revelation
[25:15] of these seals makes a body change right
[25:17] yeah okay you ever understand that maybe
[25:19] maybe I could confuse you more not
[25:21] trying to help you no but what I'm
[25:22] trying to say is you can't you can't say
[25:25] well I gotta understand this to get the
[25:27] Holy Ghost no you got to get the Holy
[25:28] Ghost to understand this that's right
[25:30] but to get the Holy Ghost and not
[25:31] understand these is not a problem
[25:34] you're just gonna have to die before you
[25:37] take a body change
[25:38] is that okay everybody all right over
[25:41] there you okay with that FF Bosworth is
[25:43] dead
[25:44] all the people from February the 15th
[25:46] 2012 from this day backwards trying to
[25:50] think of somebody even brother Tom
[25:52] some of the ones just went on they went
[25:54] on because they didn't have the total
[25:56] Revelation and hey you know what
[26:04] 21 I was sitting in here brother Brown
[26:07] said one in a million yes
[26:09] they might be 20 of us have to die yeah
[26:14] one left that's right in this room right
[26:16] here but no shame I mean we're all born
[26:19] again right no shame that's right Body
[26:22] Spirit Souls got chain back then
[26:28] but they had to die but you've got to
[26:31] know this to get all three of these
[26:33] things change and that's what Daddy's
[26:35] really trying to preach right now he's
[26:37] really trying to preach that that Soul
[26:39] inside perfect and I love it when he's
[26:41] preaching on Romans 8 1 there's
[26:43] therefore now now no condemnation he
[26:45] ain't talking about soul
[26:48] soul never had condemnation start with
[26:49] but he said there is therefore now no he
[26:52] must be talking about something else
[26:54] must be talking about the outside guys
[26:55] that's right that's right everybody
[26:57] understand that yes one more time
[26:59] Revelations eight there is therefore now
[27:02] no condemnation so Paul came to a point
[27:07] in his Revelation or in his prophecy
[27:10] that there was going to come a group of
[27:11] people that even your body
[27:14] was not going to have anything counted
[27:16] against you
[27:17] not that we're going to be a bunch of
[27:18] robots or be a bunch of people that you
[27:20] know uh don't live life just like we're
[27:22] talking about going to this course I
[27:24] still believe in you know we got to
[27:25] still live
[27:27] I've seen quacks you've seen quacks
[27:29] you've seen people in this message you
[27:30] know take all the kids out of school put
[27:31] them to work you know what they'll work
[27:33] till the day they die they don't ever
[27:34] have nothing
[27:35] uh you know look who want to have a
[27:37] brother Danny he's a good example if
[27:39] they have not prepared before
[27:43] you never know you may fall off the
[27:44] house tomorrow and I may fall off the
[27:46] house tomorrow
[27:48] I know if you don't wish I known me
[27:49] worst enemy
[27:51] but what I'm saying is I go in in these
[27:54] foreclosed homes and I see these great
[27:55] big homes I see a swimming pool I see a
[27:58] place where they used to park a boat at
[27:59] least it does too you see I mean you go
[28:04] and they probably made wives of money
[28:06] you know 100 Grand a year maybe or more
[28:09] or 200 Grand a year some of these when
[28:11] we do gone why because maybe the wife
[28:15] boom lost their job so now they got to
[28:17] live off one income
[28:19] they've extended their stuff so much
[28:22] till like Lisa said if they had enough
[28:24] money to buy and fill up a swimming pool
[28:26] they ought to save that money and paid
[28:27] the bill and that's the truth
[28:29] and that's what this course will teach
[28:31] you too it'll give you a little bit and
[28:32] it'll give you scriptural background
[28:34] because you know the Bible says that the
[28:36] borrower is always slave to the lender
[28:38] that's right
[28:40] always the borrower if you borrow and
[28:42] hey I owe money on my house but that's
[28:44] it I don't own no more man it's not my
[28:46] house
[28:47] just a little bit not much but you still
[28:50] if anything ever happened to me or
[28:53] anything ever happened to Jim well June
[28:55] I don't want anything just to happen to
[28:57] her but since I haven't heard but I'd be
[28:58] okay but if anything ever happened to me
[29:00] I should have enough provision that she
[29:01] can at least pay the house off
[29:03] and have some money left over
[29:06] right
[29:07] because you never know you said well
[29:08] we're going to take a Rapture one in a
[29:10] million remember that's one in a million
[29:13] believers
[29:14] that's not one in a million out here in
[29:16] the world right that was one in a
[29:18] million believers are going to stand for
[29:20] the body chain so you know the message
[29:22] 40 something year and I've heard that 40
[29:25] something years we're going in the
[29:27] Raptor so we're not going to yeah put up
[29:29] nothing or nothing but this live and
[29:32] spend everything and whatever and them
[29:34] people don't have it and we've even
[29:37] heard people that say that they they go
[29:39] in they just get a credit card and run
[29:40] the credit card bill up because they
[29:42] were going in a Rapture well guess what
[29:47] they're still playing on them now
[29:49] because rap train took place and that
[29:50] was 20 something years ago
[29:52] so you know that's just really not
[29:57] intelligent
[29:59] trying to get away from all the mother
[30:01] words I told them to have to shop the
[30:02] other day I didn't want to hear idiot
[30:03] and stupid again because I hear that all
[30:05] day I don't hear it no more so we got
[30:07] they're not intelligent are less
[30:09] intelligent and that's true we all have
[30:12] a little bit of an intelligence problem
[30:14] when it comes to a lot of things I'm not
[30:16] strong in a lot of areas I'm weak in a
[30:17] lot of areas but you know what we base
[30:20] everything on though that God will take
[30:21] care of us but we don't be stupid that
[30:23] God's gonna take care of us say well
[30:24] we're just not going to work God's Gonna
[30:25] no he's not gonna put that pork chop on
[30:27] your plate
[30:29] you're gonna go Walmart or film her and
[30:32] buy that pork chop now when you get Dash
[30:34] print and you've done all you can do and
[30:37] you don't know there's nothing else to
[30:38] do and you you know you fall sick or
[30:40] something happens to you I believe God
[30:42] will take care of you but not just
[30:44] willingly say hey
[30:46] I ain't doing a thing God's just going
[30:48] to take care of all my needs see brother
[30:51] Danny and sister George they took care
[30:52] of a lot of their needs beforehand they
[30:54] had insurance
[30:55] they had money put back and they're okay
[30:58] my point is if that would have happened
[31:00] to a normal couple that's why we do
[31:02] foreclosed homes
[31:03] because if brother Dan lost his income
[31:05] for a year almost when his year almost a
[31:08] year right out of the Year wasn't it
[31:11] one of you take what you make a year and
[31:13] say I'm not making that no more for a
[31:15] year and see how long you're gonna last
[31:18] thank you sister you're not going to
[31:20] last long at all but they made
[31:22] Provisions they were intelligent enough
[31:25] humanly intelligent enough to say hey
[31:28] this could happen
[31:30] and then not being foolished I mean they
[31:31] drive car with 300 000 miles on it so do
[31:34] I now how much 365 365 000 miles you say
[31:39] my gosh but you know what Dave Ramsey
[31:43] loves that he said hey
[31:45] no car payment finally the car is paying
[31:47] off because you never went on a car you
[31:50] know that as well as I do you always
[31:51] gonna you know be behind but but as long
[31:54] as you keep it up I mean where do we
[31:56] they drive a long way to work every day
[31:59] get in and go but you know what make
[32:02] Provisions what I'm saying same thing
[32:03] with these seals we're going to make
[32:05] Provisions that's right that it's not
[32:07] just that we're going to be saved and
[32:10] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[32:12] Ghost
[32:13] that's okay
[32:15] but we something's pulling us further
[32:20] because the Holy Ghost said I'll be with
[32:22] you even in you and I'll in other words
[32:24] take you into all truth show you things
[32:26] to come right so God I believe God's
[32:29] given us a holy intelligence
[32:32] so we don't have to be filthy rich
[32:35] but we don't have to live poor either
[32:37] right
[32:38] I call it comfortable
[32:41] and and in this class what helped what
[32:44] helped me it modified my behavior June
[32:46] and I were doing some things Danny Joyce
[32:48] were doing some things but this really
[32:50] modifies your behavior it makes you do
[32:52] things that you sometimes you don't want
[32:54] to do
[32:55] you'll hear Dave Ramsey say beans and
[32:56] rice and then the next night you have
[32:58] something different you have rice and
[32:59] beans that's true
[33:02] but I mean why and look
[33:05] if you enjoy a steak that's fine but but
[33:07] you know he kind of gives you a gives
[33:10] you a lot of pointers and I really
[33:11] enjoyed it I'm like that that's fine do
[33:14] I you just get them if you can afford
[33:15] steak that's fine send it on paper first
[33:17] yeah that's one that's what this whole
[33:19] thing is you put it on paper and that's
[33:21] the same thing that talk about these
[33:22] seals it's something that you've got to
[33:24] be committed to
[33:26] you can't just not read your Bible and
[33:27] get revelation of the seal if you can't
[33:29] just not come to church but once or
[33:30] twice a month and get the revelation of
[33:32] the sales you can't do that
[33:34] right and you know what you know that
[33:37] but a lot of people know that and still
[33:39] do it see that's that's where iniquity
[33:41] comes in I remember the first seal was
[33:43] the mystery of iniquity knowing to do
[33:45] different and you don't do it right
[33:47] knowing to do different you said to
[33:49] Message Church you know these things
[33:53] and some Jesus said one time you know in
[33:55] the reading of the when David reads the
[33:57] the scripture for the communion he says
[34:00] happier they happier ye if you do them
[34:03] right what do the artists of God
[34:05] happy are you if you do that all right
[34:07] so have your you if we do finish this
[34:10] we're going to finish this third seal by
[34:12] showing that we need to we need to still
[34:14] die even though we're born again
[34:16] we need to still die
[34:19] pop was talking this morning and I was
[34:21] just talking about we're not rich
[34:23] whatever
[34:24] pay your time he promised
[34:28] promise that's right
[34:31] that's right and if he does that you're
[34:34] not going to starve or you're not going
[34:37] to be without something somebody told me
[34:39] one time said I can't afford to pay my
[34:41] ties I said I can't afford nothing
[34:42] exactly right that's the first check we
[34:45] write every month and Dave even tell you
[34:47] he said that but that's so strange that
[34:48] you see these great big churches they're
[34:50] building out in the world
[34:52] these great big worship centers they're
[34:54] building and only three percent of their
[34:56] congregation Ties on a regular basis in
[34:58] other words every week right
[35:01] that's hard to believe
[35:03] right yeah it's hard to believe
[35:06] do it he's blessing something yeah
[35:08] somebody's getting a blessing you know
[35:10] and that's what's that's what you and I
[35:12] need to look at these seals these seals
[35:14] are not a condemnation the seals are a
[35:16] condemnation to the world but it's a
[35:17] blessing to us right this is this should
[35:20] be blessing you say death yeah it's too
[35:22] much of me alive I know that you know
[35:24] why because I live with this guy right
[35:25] here every day I see that I need to do
[35:27] just like Paul Die daily Paul wasn't
[35:30] talking about dying for the Holy Ghost
[35:31] again he already had the Holy Ghost so
[35:33] what was going to die the old nature he
[35:35] said well the old Nature's dead
[35:36] somewhere in there that old nature of me
[35:39] is gone that used to do the things of
[35:41] the world but I still got a spirit that
[35:44] Satan can still penetrate down through
[35:45] this through these and these and this
[35:49] right the five senses he can still
[35:51] penetrate at least down to that spirit
[35:53] and you live in memory reason conscious
[35:56] affection and Imagination five things
[35:58] that you that Satan still plays in those
[36:01] five Realms right he can't play down
[36:03] into Faith or doubt if he's not down
[36:05] there your faith right but what do we do
[36:09] we build the wall that holds that Holy
[36:12] Ghost and don't let it out
[36:14] but then when we let the Holy Ghost take
[36:17] over our memory take over our reasoning
[36:19] that's right I wished I could lose my
[36:21] memory I really do
[36:23] back until 12 years ago I wish my memory
[36:25] would just erase but you know God said
[36:27] he never even remembered the sins to
[36:29] start with thank God for that because if
[36:33] he remembered him he'd have to account
[36:34] them to you that's right man see so he
[36:37] don't account to you because he can't
[36:38] remember him but see we then we do
[36:40] things every day that we have to ask God
[36:42] to forgive him for I hope you pray every
[36:43] morning God forgive me don't forgive me
[36:45] of what I've done forgive me I mean
[36:47] forgive me what's coming forgive me what
[36:48] I've done go be Catholic
[36:51] Lord forgive me this morning I know I'm
