[4:22] just regular scripture we've been
[4:24] reading
[4:26] in
[4:28] Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of
[4:31] the Church of the lady of sanr these
[4:34] things sayth the amen the faithful and
[4:37] true witness the beginning of the
[4:39] creation of God all right let's just go
[4:41] back to where we were on the same
[4:43] scripture we used in the last message to
[4:46] Malachi 4 because I want us to pick up
[4:51] that part and try to continue on in our
[4:53] thought so remember now it says Malachi
[4:56] 4:4 said remember ye the law of Moses is
[4:59] my servant which I commanded unto him in
[5:02] for all Israel with his statutes
[5:05] and judgment remember what I said
[5:07] everything back there is pointing down
[5:12] here okay he told it all there he told
[5:15] what would happen there in Malachi all
[5:18] right now then he goes through the
[5:19] points of what would be there John the
[5:21] Baptist and in the end time to come to
[5:25] the uh forth coming of Elijah behold I
[5:28] will send you the prophet before the
[5:31] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[5:32] the Lord and he shall turn a heart of
[5:34] the fathers to the children and a heart
[5:37] of the children to their fathers lest I
[5:39] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[5:42] you may be seated the Lord add his
[5:44] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[5:48] I've been approached by some that ask
[5:53] about the services our Sunday morning
[5:56] and the brother and what he was bringing
[5:59] and and uh I had a discussion with him
[6:02] about that but I'm like this that's like
[6:04] I told him uh what anybody believes is
[6:08] their business that's their point that's
[6:10] all right that's that's their business
[6:12] you know to do whatever but then I said
[6:15] I've been approached about it so I I
[6:17] have to come to the pull pit and say a
[6:19] few words about it and uh if you'll
[6:22] notice he kept saying that that a lot of
[6:25] that was
[6:27] circumstantial well you know
[6:30] um we had a man back about a year before
[6:34] that had a whole lot about
[6:35] circumstantial and his point was that
[6:38] Adam placed his seed into Eve to save
[6:42] her well there's none of that written in
[6:44] the Bible so circumstantial means a
[6:47] point that in other words if you you got
[6:50] a witness to a crime and they witness
[6:53] that's not circumstantial right
[6:55] circumstantial is when you supposing a
[6:58] lot of things you know kind of doing it
[7:01] in that line and
[7:03] circumstantial and then you know brother
[7:06] saying those things that he brought out
[7:08] I said well I'm glad you said
[7:10] circumstantial because that uh you know
[7:14] I'm like
[7:15] this if the prophet says it I believe it
[7:19] all right but if he doesn't explain
[7:22] something then it's best for us to not
[7:26] to try to
[7:27] suppose a lot on what we think and we
[7:30] you know we see something and we say
[7:32] well that looks like that's got to be
[7:34] that's if the prophet didn't say that
[7:38] then you're going on your own even
[7:40] though you may think you have a right of
[7:43] that point and that's all right uh but
[7:46] you know the brother made the statement
[7:48] that uh ham had a relationship with
[7:54] Noah's wife which would have been his
[7:56] own
[7:57] mother and that was this
[7:59] the point that it says there you know
[8:02] what happened in uh with Noah but and
[8:06] that it it just won't hold together and
[8:10] that's what I expressed a couple of
[8:11] little points and I'll just make a
[8:13] statement or two and then we'll get off
[8:15] of that and go on now in the time when
[8:19] Noah and them you know after the ark the
[8:22] one question I asked him I said how old
[8:25] was Noah
[8:27] and his wife wife I said according to
[8:31] records there's no children was born you
[8:35] know other than ham sham and japeth to
[8:37] them and I said besides it the Bible
[8:40] says that Noah planted a Vineyard how
[8:43] long would it take to get a Vineyard up
[8:45] and another where you can get some
[8:46] grapes off of it to to be able I said
[8:48] you adding too much time you know to
[8:50] your point but I said it's all right but
[8:53] see that's he was taking his point and I
[8:56] enjoyed up to that part um I did I
[8:59] enjoyed what he had to say up to that
[9:01] was fine when Bringing Down the the seed
[9:03] of The Serpent and the things but I I
[9:07] didn't agree with that part so I went
[9:10] and just looked it up I knew what it was
[9:12] but I wanted to make sure I looked it up
[9:14] to see and brother brandham says I they
[9:17] can pull this up on questions and
[9:18] answers Real 2 and 54 uh
[9:22] 10:3 and I've run the message to try to
[9:25] find anything that related to any of the
[9:28] points
[9:29] and but this is what brother brandham
[9:33] says now you see ham sham and now
[9:36] ham he did not try to hide his
[9:42] father's now he did not try to hide his
[9:45] father's nakedness but laughed and made
[9:48] fun of it and God put a curse on him for
[9:51] looking to his father's nakedness and
[9:54] not trying to cover up his shame and ham
[9:57] sham and japo backed up and threw their
[10:00] coats over their father when he was
[10:02] laying naked and now God told ham that
[10:06] his this gener his generation would
[10:09] serve the others all right that was that
[10:12] was fine but you know I know they have
[10:15] it there go ahead and pull up the one in
[10:17] Genesis where it talks about it because
[10:19] I want you to look at the point of the
[10:21] scripture and Noah began to be in
[10:23] husbandman and he planted a Vineyard he
[10:25] drank the wine and was drunken was UN
[10:27] and was uncovered Within his tent now I
[10:31] mean that's just plain as anybody could
[10:33] want to know or read anything whatever
[10:36] you want to go from there now maybe some
[10:38] of you don't know it maybe I shouldn't
[10:40] mention it but for a long time back oh
[10:44] 30 40 years they were saying then that
[10:48] they believed that ham was a
[10:51] homosexual you may have heard that or
[10:53] may not have heard it but they were
[10:55] actually some of the men in the message
[10:57] were teaching that well I didn't agree
[10:59] agree with that and I don't agree with
[11:01] with the the person you know what was
[11:03] being said but look what he said and ham
[11:06] the father of Cana saw the nakedness of
[11:08] his
[11:09] father and told his two Brethren without
[11:12] it doesn't say a thing about him
[11:13] touching or anything no relationship no
[11:17] touching he saw
[11:19] him saw him laying there naked probably
[11:22] Noah got drunk you know and he was
[11:25] laying out there and look sham and japa
[11:28] took a gar
[11:29] and laid it upon both their shoulders
[11:31] and went backward and they covered their
[11:33] father's nakedness he had the scriptures
[11:36] he were using a lot of those things is
[11:38] throughout there about uh you know if
[11:41] you lay with this if you do this or if
[11:43] you do that if you do that
[11:48] but the one question I asked him and the
[11:51] question I would ask
[11:53] you is this this
[11:56] point uh he said and I told him about
[12:02] that and gave him the quote he said that
[12:05] Eve was
[12:09] cursed well now brother brandom
[12:11] according to uh paragraph 3:26 if you
[12:14] want to pull it up in the future home
[12:16] said do God didn't curse
[12:18] Adam he might have done the same thing
[12:21] but he cursed the Earth thorns and
[12:24] thistles he didn't curse
[12:27] Eve but said Adam would be her ruler
[12:30] amen I ask him a simple question that I
[12:33] ask you and it's a uh hypothetical or
[12:38] circumstantial
[12:40] circumstantial okay it's one we're we're
[12:43] just you know circumstantial a
[12:46] little the
[12:48] Beast was cursed and made a
[12:52] snake
[12:54] right all
[12:55] right now if Eve was to have been cursed
[13:01] would she been made a
[13:04] snake circumstantial
[13:07] evidences see we can all think and have
[13:10] our points and our thoughts not to try
[13:14] doctrinal issues or nothing because
[13:15] there's no doctrinal issues to those
[13:17] things you go into circumstantial things
[13:20] that you think looks
[13:23] good and and when you wind up it doesn't
[13:27] turn out too good because Eve wasn't
[13:30] cursed you say yes he was now the whole
[13:33] human race was cursed amen right the
[13:36] whole human race was cursed with the
[13:39] curse that was placed upon Eve the curse
[13:42] that was placed upon the the Beast made
[13:45] him a snake but the curse that came on
[13:49] mankind was not to make them go into the
[13:53] snake Kingdom you know it was to make
[13:56] them to be that the wound was
[14:01] cursed all right and see the brother
[14:04] kept he emphasized and gave a quote out
[14:06] of serpent
[14:08] seed emphasizing like ham and what he
[14:12] said was he said the seed come over in
[14:15] the ark just like it did in the
[14:17] beginning through the
[14:19] woman well that's all right that's the
[14:21] direct
[14:24] quote but see woman you may signify only
[14:28] one see he was leaning his thought
[14:33] toward Noah's
[14:37] wife but that doesn't work because
[14:39] that's not the quote brother brandham
[14:41] says now that's the quote he says it he
[14:44] said just like in the beginning through
[14:47] the woman their
[14:50] wives now if you can pull that one up on
[14:53] the serpent seed paragraph 197 see They
[14:56] Carried the seed of Satan right through
[14:59] the
[15:00] ark the
[15:02] wives what was it the polluted
[15:05] wound that's just simple that's not
[15:09] circumstantial that's plain
[15:11] sense because you know the Bible said
[15:13] that anything of woman is what full of
[15:16] trouble and no good but I'm just saying
[15:20] that I didn't care for that thoughts so
[15:24] that way and I did tell him I would
[15:26] correct it with the you know with the
[15:29] church and tell it I didn't agree with
[15:30] that but I wasn't going to lambast him
[15:32] about it that's everybody's belief to
[15:35] believe what you want to
[15:37] believe it's hard enough and problems
[15:40] enough to stay with the message to the
[15:43] point of taking and stay in with the way
[15:45] brother brandham brings it amen I don't
[15:48] mean that wrong I just mean it is hard
[15:51] enough to keep things straight sometime
[15:53] because the way sometimes he'll seem
[15:55] like he says this sometimes seem like he
[15:57] says that that you know and trying to
[16:00] bring together those things we don't
[16:02] need to hatch up some more things you
[16:04] know but see people those things they
[16:07] want something like to get an
[16:10] attention and like I said you know uh
[16:14] the doctrines has been there that they
[16:16] thought ham was a
[16:17] homosexual the doctrines has been there
[16:20] even as I mentioned it that uh you know
[16:23] that Adam placed his seed into Eve to
[16:27] save her that would make sex you're
[16:30] Redemptive and that won't
[16:32] work but just just let that go and let
[16:35] it let it I wouldn't I told him I said
[16:37] it doesn't bother
[16:38] me because I just don't believe it I
[16:42] said you know I'm not going to say
[16:44] you're wrong I'm going to say I don't
[16:49] understand
[16:50] it I don't understand it I can't see
[16:54] that away so then there's no problems
[16:57] with with doing that but that's all
[16:59] right that there you know I did write
[17:02] some little things in you know that to
[17:04] uh Express but
[17:09] um
[17:13] circumstantial like you say
[17:15] circumstantial
[17:17] evidence is proof of a
[17:20] facts offered as evidence for which
[17:25] other facts are to be inferred
[17:29] you know in in infer s in other words
[17:32] say that s contrasted with direct
[17:36] evidence it's not no direct and the word
[17:39] circumstantial using it by itself really
[17:41] means unessential y circumstances means
[17:46] when you look it up it means
[17:48] unessential it means secondary
[17:51] y it means
[17:56] incidental and and you know it just
[17:59] won't work you don't don't do it okay I
[18:01] made that point and I'm not nobody uh I
[18:06] still love everybody and forget it but I
[18:08] just don't agree okay now let's get into
[18:10] what we've been talking
[18:12] about now we've been talking about
[18:15] that's why we read in am Malachi the
[18:18] point there that we know they remember
[18:20] back a few weeks ago when we're
[18:21] preaching that then the the spirit of
[18:25] Elijah would come five times
[18:29] all right it came in Elijah it came in
[18:31] Elisha it came in John the Baptist it
[18:35] came in William brandham in the last
[18:37] days and it will be in one of the two
[18:41] witnesses over to Israel to finish the
[18:44] five times all right it's the same
[18:50] Ministry all right because all of it is
[18:52] bringing forth the word of God all right
[18:56] but it's not the same way a or thought
[18:59] or method or or doing you can't take uh
[19:04] you can
[19:05] compare brother brandom and the other
[19:08] Elijah by saying they were Wilderness
[19:10] men they were Hunters they were doing
[19:13] but that's not to do with their message
[19:15] you can't take the this message and do a
[19:19] lot with this message to this message to
[19:21] that message other than saying they're
[19:23] bringing the word of God all right so
[19:26] then it would be that you could have the
[19:28] five steps stages or whatever of the
[19:32] ministry of
[19:33] Elijah all right now my whole point has
[19:37] been for the past few Services is
[19:40] talking about the ministry of Jesus
[19:43] Christ all right now we went back to
[19:47] show it in
[19:48] stages how that before the Lord Jesus
[19:52] Christ was crucified he gave the
[19:56] disciples power to cast out Devils heal
[19:59] the sick even to raise the Dead the many
[20:03] great things was given them but there
[20:05] was some things that would be given
[20:08] later that were not instilled into them
[20:12] at that point but that was the ministry
[20:15] of Jesus Christ all right now I
[20:18] emphasized there that to me now that
[20:22] when you talking about the ministry of
[20:24] Jesus Christ and then you can look at
[20:27] and you can see healing and signs and
[20:29] wonders you can see it all down Through
[20:32] the Ages and through time that uh you
[20:35] know it's been there and see the reason
[20:39] it's been there was because Jesus Christ
[20:41] gave that before
[20:44] Calvary see then it would leave it open
[20:47] as we'll get to the scripture later
[20:49] tonight or maybe
[20:51] Sunday we'll get to the scripture where
[20:54] it says I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[20:56] Flesh that's right right
[20:58] all right now we know that that was
[21:02] poured out back there 2,000 years ago
[21:05] but we know too that it was poured out
[21:08] in the last days to fulfill the
[21:11] scriptures but remember now it's poured
[21:13] out in the last 2,000 years because I've
[21:16] got the quotes laying here from the
[21:17] prophet it's been poured out the last
[21:19] 2,000 well that means it started there
[21:23] and it's still being poured out it's
[21:25] just meaning the point that it started
[21:29] from The Upper Room experience in a
[21:32] great way and then come through the ages
[21:36] and it is to finish in the last days as
[21:39] the ministry of Jesus
[21:42] Christ then it's easier to look to see
[21:45] I'll get back to it more and more we
[21:47] look at and say well The Headstone was
[21:49] rejected well we don't know what it
[21:51] looks like we don't know no no no no
[21:53] you're you're wrong
[21:55] there your headstone is exactly the same
[21:58] thing as the Cornerstone Cornerstone was
[22:01] revelation of Jesus Christ so The
[22:03] Headstone has got to be the revelation
[22:05] of Jesus
[22:06] Christ but it's something that was not
[22:09] understood down through time that's
[22:11] right all right and I've tried to
[22:13] emphasize the point like I said Jesus
[22:16] gave them
[22:17] power they found a man over here healing
[22:20] in time there was not of them but Jesus
[22:24] said leave him alone it's in the gospel
[22:26] leave him alone said because if he ain't
[22:29] if he ain't against us he's for us you
[22:31] know leave him alone he just some way he
[22:35] picked up that point and it worked all
[22:38] right but then we found out that Jesus
[22:41] spoke
[22:42] of a coming of the baptism of the Holy
[22:46] Ghost the
[22:48] kingdom and as he spoke of those things
[22:51] that would take place in a greater
[22:53] manner or
[22:56] way when he would go go
[22:58] away and come
[23:01] back you don't have other disciples with
[23:03] the ability to impart eternal life
[23:07] before
[23:08] Calvary right but now after Calvary
[23:11] they're giv that right all right but
[23:14] just remember now that we kept giving
[23:16] the emphasis if you want them raise your
[23:18] hand with thow them on the screen or
[23:19] whatever to to for you to understand
[23:23] remember Jesus could not impart eternal
[23:27] life
[23:29] amen he said well now you getting well I
[23:32] well I mean I'm was honest I can be show
[23:34] it to me where he gave eternal life to
[23:36] anybody because the Holy Ghost had not
[23:39] been given that was John right and we
[23:41] gave about three quotes where brother
[23:43] random said that even Jesus could not
[23:46] preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz
[23:49] it did not come yet he said well why did
[23:52] he preach he preached the Kingdom
[23:54] right right he preached the kingdom
[23:58] but he was saying it's at hand all right
[24:01] but then when he came into to Calvary
[24:05] and came back no longer is it preaching
[24:08] that's it's at hand like way out
[24:10] somewhere it's here all right now see
[24:15] then in doing that then
[24:18] see we know that Jesus himself not being
[24:21] able
[24:23] to now I'm looking at the quote where
[24:25] it's got it on the five identification
[24:29] if they want to pull that up it be
[24:30] number two if Christ would not let a
[24:33] bunch of men who'd walk with him for
[24:37] three and a half
[24:38] years go preach any
[24:42] gospel or could not preach any gospel
[24:47] until they waited for the Holy Ghost
[24:50] right the church today has to do the
[24:53] same thing what wait for the Holy Ghost
[24:57] all right
[24:58] see there's no
[25:00] way that you can give the Holy Ghost to
[25:03] anyone we know that it's not to say I'm
[25:05] going to impart eternal life I'll just F
[25:07] I'll just give it to somebody no that's
[25:10] what the man in Acts thought they were
[25:12] doing he said give me power to lay my
[25:15] hands on somebody and give them the Holy
[25:17] Ghost the way you've been doing it and
[25:19] Peter says you don't know what you're
[25:20] talking about in other
[25:21] words cuz he wasn't just giving out the
[25:24] Holy Ghost just laying hands on giving
[25:26] out and doing no it had to be done
[25:29] according to the word that's why your
[25:31] Prophet would emphasize
[25:33] what if you want to try to uh impart
[25:37] eternal
[25:39] life he said here's the water get them
[25:42] to the water what is imparting eternal
[25:44] life what would it be first is I
[25:46] remember I brought it out you had to
[25:48] have
[25:49] it and if Jesus could not preach it
[25:53] until he went to the
[25:55] stages you know or you want call it till
[25:58] it come to a place then of the
[26:00] crucifixion then when he came back he
[26:03] could impart eternal
[26:05] life right but he didn't just impart it
[26:09] on anybody you can't do that it's not to
[26:12] just give out like this go just give it
[26:14] out you got to go
[26:18] scriptural scriptural you got to go to
[26:21] the through the scriptures you got to
[26:22] line them up repent everyone and be
[26:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[26:26] remission of sins and you shall receive
[26:28] the gift of the Holy Ghost but now I
[26:30] hope you follow the point
[26:33] though once Jesus went to where he was
[26:36] and come back he could impart eternal
[26:40] life all right and once he could impart
[26:43] eternal life to the ones he imparted it
[26:46] to they could impart eternal life also
[26:50] not just go out I'll give it to you I
[26:52] I'll let you have it you can have it
[26:53] I'll hand it out not that
[26:55] way it's getting them in the
[27:00] word right getting them into the word
[27:04] telling them what the word
[27:06] says and you tell somebody repent every
[27:09] want be baptized I ain't doing that but
[27:10] I want the Holy Ghost well you ain't
[27:12] going to get it well you going to tell
[27:14] me I'm not going to get yeah I'm going
[27:15] to tell you a't going to get it is that
[27:17] plain enough going be no argument cuz
[27:21] ain't no argument to it if you won't do
[27:23] what the word
[27:25] says how can you get eternal life
[27:31] there's there's where the trouble with
[27:32] mankind see but now the point of doing
[27:35] all of that was to get to one thing that
[27:38] I ended the message
[27:40] up talking
[27:43] about the same Ministry that Jesus
[27:53] had so follow me
[27:56] now he gave him his ministry before
[27:59] Calvary that was his ministry they had
[28:02] the same Ministry he
[28:05] had they could cast out Devils they
[28:07] could heal the sick they could raise the
[28:10] dead and that's what he
[28:12] done but they couldn't impart eternal
[28:15] life they could in no way bring
[28:17] Salvation back to the
[28:20] people but neither could he that's
[28:24] right because he said he would do it
[28:27] that away all right and that's the way
[28:30] it's going to be done but then after
[28:33] Calvary and after the Holy Ghost
[28:35] came now you moved up a step in the
[28:38] ministry of Jesus
[28:40] Christ right you moved up to
[28:44] Salvation whereas before then you were
[28:46] only speaking of things to
[28:50] come but you come to
[28:52] Salvation all right there on the day of
[28:55] Pentecost then it was 3,000 Reed
[28:58] salvation at one time right
[29:03] right it was
[29:06] imparted right what did they say men and
[29:09] Brethren what must we
[29:13] do and I like the way brother R said it
[29:16] you know they said what must we do he
[29:18] said we tell them what not to do and all
[29:20] this that and the other he said that
[29:22] wasn't a question amen they didn't
[29:24] preach a legalistic message and got
[29:27] people saved now I don't mean I believe
[29:29] in firm believer and living
[29:31] right there's one quote in here that
[29:33] brother Brown says if you talk about the
[29:36] the being able to impart eternal life he
[29:39] said you got to have it in your
[29:42] life right it can't be done just because
[29:45] of anything all right but see the
[29:47] ministry of Jesus
[29:52] Christ the 3,000 went forth
[29:56] immediately under the ministry of Jesus
[29:59] Christ a partaker of
[30:02] that but now we know that they did
[30:06] not of the 3,000 receive the same
[30:11] position whatever you want to call it
[30:14] placing uh cuz you can't divide up in
[30:17] amount that doesn't work you know a
[30:18] mount that doesn't work uh the least
[30:20] little amount in God is just as much as
[30:22] the greatest amount that's right but
[30:25] that 3,000 see they they could go out
[30:28] and talk to others of eternal life that
[30:30] they had in their
[30:31] lives but still you see the group that
[30:34] had come
[30:36] to the upper room
[30:40] experience that that
[30:42] group was set in a deeper position amen
[30:45] higher position whatever you want to
[30:47] call it what you make the
[30:49] wordings set in a different
[30:52] realm all right brother Randon will use
[30:54] the word so we can use it and and and
[30:57] I'm sorry that that's all the words i'
[30:59] have
[31:00] but those in the upper room had a great
[31:03] deep experience that's cuz they'd been
[31:06] trained for three and A2
[31:08] years but the ones
[31:10] outside 3,000 they only heard one
[31:15] sermon right but yet they received
[31:18] eternal
[31:20] life right now by them receiving eternal
[31:26] life
[31:28] they could have went out to help imp
[31:31] part eternal life that's right cuz they
[31:33] could go tell others how they got
[31:35] saved is that the way brother Rand said
[31:38] about it when the man come to it what
[31:39] should we do brother Randon should we
[31:41] seek gifts should we seek that should we
[31:43] do that he said just go tell how you
[31:46] candle got
[31:47] lit that's right go tell them about the
[31:50] Christ in you but that Upper Room
[31:52] experienced people were not as I was
[31:54] going to use the word right around uses
[31:56] the word novice
[31:59] yeah see no novice wrote anything in the
[32:02] scripture right you
[32:05] know it wasn't that all of those
[32:10] writers was in the upper room
[32:13] maybe because you got some like Timothy
[32:16] and different
[32:17] things but there was no novice used to
[32:20] write the
[32:22] word so then you would be counting the
[32:25] 3,000 as no
[32:29] this we heard this the other day about
[32:32] somebody that we've heard of and known
[32:35] and they're in a place and uh now they
[32:39] they they're going to be a
[32:42] preacher well that's all right I ain't
[32:44] saying nothing about it I'm just saying
[32:47] that you take them off his brother run
[32:49] set a dance floor on Saturday night and
[32:51] put them in the pull pit on Sunday
[32:52] morning preaching now that doesn't work
[32:56] too good
[32:57] you put somebody in a dry
[33:00] out
[33:02] clinic and then they confess they called
[33:04] to
[33:05] preach while they in the dry out
[33:08] Clinic I'm just too old that doesn't fit
[33:11] now I'm sorry I'm not telling God how to
[33:14] do his business cuz that ain't none of
[33:16] my
[33:16] business but I'm just saying that don't
[33:18] look too good that's right there's a lot
[33:20] of circumstan will around
[33:23] that circumstances will get caught up
[33:25] and that guy will when he comes out of
[33:27] and starts trying to preach he get into
[33:30] some circumstances all right but now see
[33:33] talking about I'm trying to get a point
[33:36] in your
[33:37] mind because I got a a message to follow
[33:40] this but I'm I'm trying to get a point
[33:42] in your
[33:45] mind of the ministry of Jesus
[33:48] Christ and people today would say I
[33:51] don't see the ministry of Jesus
[33:55] Christ
[33:59] see Believers in the message and people
[34:01] would say I just don't see the ministry
[34:02] of Jesus
[34:05] Christ
[34:09] well you want to meet right over here in
[34:11] this Baptist Church or or go to a
[34:14] Pentecostal church and see somebody
[34:16] healed or delivered from drugs
[34:21] and that's the point I've been
[34:23] making Jesus gave the disciples
[34:27] before
[34:29] Calvary that ability to do
[34:32] that and thereby pouring out his Spirit
[34:35] on All
[34:38] Flesh it would bring All Flesh to the
[34:43] ability to where they could pray for the
[34:47] sick cast out
[34:49] devils are you following me see that
[34:52] works you tell me that don't work then
[34:55] you tell me I don't see the ministry of
[34:56] Jesus
[34:58] Christ I just say meet me this Sunday
[35:01] we'll go up and gains with a free chapel
[35:03] and they'll probably have
[35:05] miracles in that
[35:09] service well who's doing
[35:11] it remember what Jesus
[35:14] said when they said he ain't one of us
[35:17] you know that's what the people in the
[35:19] message say right people in the message
[35:22] bad to say you know they're just not one
[35:24] of us we're we're something different
[35:28] well why don't we act different that's
[35:30] right that's right if we're the son of a
[35:32] king let's act like the son of a king
[35:34] that's right you remember the story son
[35:36] of the king you remember the African guy
[35:38] came over that was happy and doing and
[35:40] running the rest of them they had to
[35:41] beat him to get him to
[35:42] work he was acting like the son of a
[35:45] king cuz that's who he was all right see
[35:49] my point is to try to get you away from
[35:53] thinking negative thoughts amen
[35:58] negative thoughts to say we don't have
[36:01] the ministry of Jesus
[36:04] Christ well they've got
[36:06] it we can at least have
[36:09] that come
[36:12] on you going to tell me it's not out
[36:14] there
[36:18] working it's working in those
[36:23] ministers it's working in the people
[36:27] that's the ministry of Jesus Christ
[36:29] that's right if not whose Ministry is it
[36:32] now don't jump around with
[36:35] anointings because remember the
[36:37] anointing is the anointing of Jesus
[36:41] Christ so don't jump with anointings to
[36:44] say oh that's just
[36:47] anointings if anybody's ever
[36:50] healed it's got to be God doing the
[36:52] healing I don't care where they're
[36:55] at I don't care care if the pope of Rome
[36:57] does it I don't care if the Beatles done
[37:00] it that's right I don't care who it is
[37:04] is long if it works God was doing the
[37:06] working right well see then let's get
[37:10] away from that
[37:11] negative get away from I just don't see
[37:14] the ministry of Jesus
[37:20] Christ at least get to the point of
[37:22] confessing what's here amen you know
[37:27] that brother brand I want to get to it
[37:28] the Lord willing Sunday you know brother
[37:30] brand said God can't do nothing for you
[37:32] until you confess
[37:34] it that's right
[37:38] right and he said he can't do nothing
[37:40] for you that's right well you God can do
[37:44] what he wants
[37:45] to he can't break his own
[37:49] word when he said he wouldn't do it the
[37:52] prophet says he can't do it that's
[37:55] enough yeah
[37:58] right but see the ministry of Jesus
[38:02] Christ so now there right after
[38:05] Calvary you see even in that two stages
[38:10] of the ministry of Jesus
[38:12] Christ cuz you see a group of people
[38:15] that was in the upper room that were
[38:17] tutored by the word until they came to a
[38:22] place it didn't help my throat none for
[38:24] not preach for a few weeks
[38:27] so you pray for
[38:28] that but
[38:30] see that Upper Room experience put those
[38:36] disciples to right here where it said
[38:38] holy spirit on your
[38:40] pyramid now if you wanted I got it in
[38:42] the back where brother R said the
[38:44] disciples had these
[38:46] virtues
[38:47] uh what my spirit where that on the
[38:52] message the stature of a perfect man he
[38:54] said they had all these virtues in you
[38:56] here these qualifications so the
[38:58] disciples had them they didn't have the
[39:01] headstone right because the headstone
[39:03] was
[39:03] rejected it became the Chief
[39:07] Cornerstone
[39:09] right it's the same Stone it's the
[39:13] position of the stone so the position of
[39:17] the stone deals with
[39:20] different Ministry parts or whatever but
[39:23] the same
[39:24] Ministry the same Lord
[39:27] Jesus all right see then that 120 The
[39:31] Upper Room you can place them
[39:35] with as we would call it the faith of
[39:38] the
[39:40] father right cuz that would be what
[39:43] would have to be with
[39:48] Elijah now come on Elijah
[39:52] turned John the Baptist
[39:55] now brought the message stood between
[39:58] the Old Testament and the New
[40:01] Testament was the
[40:03] Keystone to plac in there to be able to
[40:07] identify Jesus
[40:11] Christ
[40:12] right was not that the ministry of Jesus
[40:15] Christ
[40:16] yes because it was meant to be that he
[40:19] would introduce all
[40:22] right but he could not bring to PA what
[40:25] he was introducing
[40:28] because that was meant for somebody else
[40:30] in another day or another stage or
[40:32] another part that's just what I'm trying
[40:34] to get you to
[40:36] see John the Baptist according to what
[40:38] we read in the
[40:40] Bible that's part of Elijah would turn
[40:42] the hearts of the Old Testament
[40:45] Saints to the New Testament message is
[40:49] so what it says turn the hearts to the
[40:51] fathers to the children what is the New
[40:53] Testament message the New Testament
[40:55] message is not a baby
[40:59] now come on
[41:02] listen when he turned those I was trying
[41:05] to hit it the other day where you'd
[41:06] think about it John spoke of the coming
[41:10] Messiah and introduced
[41:13] him right and when those
[41:17] 120 received him they
[41:22] received the
[41:24] faith of the fathers turned to the faith
[41:29] of the
[41:30] children not meaning the
[41:33] babies not in relation to baby form
[41:36] turning them to the New Testament
[41:38] message brother brand said John turned
[41:42] he spoke and pointed
[41:44] that and those disciples even some of
[41:46] his
[41:48] disciples left them and John and went
[41:51] with
[41:53] Jesus see he what he brought was
[41:56] enough come on folks right thank
[42:01] sensible do you realize when he
[42:03] introduced that one standing on the
[42:05] shores of Galilee who he
[42:07] introduced not a
[42:13] man every scripture that would be in the
[42:15] New Testament everything in the book of
[42:17] wed on the Seals Everything About That
[42:20] lamb to take the
[42:22] book there he
[42:25] stood
[42:26] amen there he stood it on on the shores
[42:29] of Galilee
[42:31] amen he didn't just turn them to a faith
[42:38] baby he turned them to a full grown sons
[42:41] and daughters of God that came out of
[42:43] the upper
[42:45] room with the ability to write the
[42:49] word not novices or babies or
[42:53] anything full grown men in the gospel
[42:56] and
[42:59] women called a faith of the
[43:05] fathers then they took the faith of the
[43:09] fathers and taught it that's what Peter
[43:12] was doing in second Peter they took the
[43:14] faith of the
[43:16] fathers and they taught those that had
[43:20] come in and receive the new birth of the
[43:22] 3000 and the others that received around
[43:26] as you would be going out to the house
[43:27] of Kus and the different ones and they
[43:31] begin to teach
[43:33] them the faith they had right right
[43:37] trying to get them to see where they had
[43:39] been turned
[43:41] to not to just a baby
[43:44] thought no they were full
[43:49] grown come on let's get out of the fact
[43:52] of whether the egg come first or the
[43:55] chicken well you don't know which one
[43:57] well I do cuz God started everything as
[44:02] full
[44:04] grown Adam and Eve was full
[44:08] grown the disciples was full grown right
[44:13] you said but they didn't have a
[44:14] headstone now come on that's why Paul
[44:16] would pick it up later in the scriptures
[44:18] and bring it to you don't go that route
[44:20] you're making yourself run off they had
[44:23] a head back there there's been a head on
[44:26] way down to ever Church age sir amen
[44:28] that's right the head of God is the
[44:30] word but it's just not come back into
[44:33] the stone that was to be because it was
[44:35] a stone of
[44:37] stumbling are you following me then the
[44:41] 3,000 and all of those outside could
[44:43] start coming up to where the disciples
[44:47] were and that's the ministry of Jesus
[44:51] Christ
[44:54] right that's why they could say Silver
[44:57] and Gold Have I None but in the name of
[44:59] Jesus
[45:01] Christ right see then here comes time
[45:05] down
[45:06] through and I've got quotes lay here
[45:09] where brother Brown said the same
[45:10] Ministry of Jesus Christ come down
[45:12] through all the ages you going to read
[45:17] that it wasn't another Ministry down
[45:20] through Luther and Wesley and them in
[45:21] the in the Dark Ages and thing you know
[45:23] some kind of it was the ministry of
[45:24] Jesus Christ might have been in the
[45:26] ministry of Jesus Christ it that the
[45:28] 3,000 received sure might have been that
[45:31] part but it was still the ministry of
[45:32] Jesus Christ there was no age without
[45:35] the ministry of Jesus Christ there was
[45:36] no age without the Holy
[45:38] Ghost you can't have
[45:41] it see then it's to get our thoughts
[45:44] away from well I just don't
[45:49] see we've got to confess what we see
[45:54] amen
[45:56] and this is not a new message to me
[45:58] you've done been women know it's a 40y
[46:01] old
[46:03] message now I've been teaching you 40
[46:05] years these things not just just coming
[46:08] down to this
[46:11] thought because I've always taught the
[46:13] ministry of Jesus Christ come down
[46:15] through there and you and I are the ones
[46:17] that the prophet would say we're living
[46:18] below our
[46:20] standards why because we won't say What
[46:23] God
[46:24] Says yeah get on that now that's
[46:26] Sunday's message
[46:28] okay all right pull back walk over
[46:33] here but what about
[46:35] it brother brand him on a message called
[46:38] Philadelphian Church age he said the
[46:40] ministry that he gave
[46:44] them was actually the sharing of his own
[46:49] Ministry with
[46:51] them for it says it in Matthew 935 to 38
[46:58] the disciples had the ministry of Jesus
[47:02] Christ that was what it was was the
[47:04] ministry of Jesus Christ in them go on
[47:07] down and just keep pulling up some we'll
[47:08] read go down to the next one
[47:09] confirmation of the commission which is
[47:11] number
[47:12] nine while they're getting it up to that
[47:15] point it says the same Holy
[47:18] Spirit he's talking about Paul and Saul
[47:20] and now that same Holy Spirit we find it
[47:23] right amongst the Pentecostal people
[47:26] today what the same Ministry of Jesus
[47:30] Christ the evening light right down
[47:33] amongst the Pentecostal people what
[47:35] preaching the same
[47:37] gospel giving Vindication of the same
[47:40] gospel the same signs that followed
[47:43] there is the same signs that follow now
[47:46] and if that Pillar of Fire listen our
[47:49] light that we have with us did not
[47:53] produce The Same Spirit and the same
[47:56] evidence it did when it was in Jesus
[47:59] Christ then it would be the wrong Pillar
[48:01] of Fire the wrong Spirit be the wrong
[48:05] thing but if it does produce and do just
[48:07] exactly what Jesus done when he said he
[48:11] that believeth in me the works that I
[48:14] do do you
[48:16] understand do you follow what he's
[48:18] saying but yet we say we don't see the
[48:20] ministry of Jesus
[48:23] Christ why are we say
[48:27] Going On To The Next One patas Vision
[48:29] number 10 on
[48:31] you and he brings it down in talking
[48:33] about an angel for each Church
[48:36] age oh that's going to be beautiful this
[48:39] week when we go back Yonder in history
[48:42] and pick up them angels and see the very
[48:45] same
[48:46] Ministry they
[48:49] had right we see the very same they had
[48:52] the same Ministry exactly the same all
[48:56] down through the ages in that little
[48:59] church the ministry of Jesus Christ has
[49:01] never
[49:04] left the problem with it is because
[49:09] mankind has rejected it by doubting
[49:15] it now he's talking about in the ages
[49:17] that the people having it the same
[49:20] Ministry Jesus Christ had had had is in
[49:23] his church tonight I'm going right on
[49:26] down through the Ephesian Church age he
[49:28] says they had the same Ministry they did
[49:30] at the beginning and that Ministry
[49:32] cannot change it must stay Pentecost all
[49:34] the way through number 12 he coming down
[49:37] to the unconditional Covenant the same
[49:40] Ministry Christ had in his had is in his
[49:43] church tonight same signs same wonders
[49:46] Same Spirit same kind of works that
[49:48] Jesus did here on Earth the church has
[49:52] to do the same thing if it's not it's
[49:55] not to the seat of Abraham it's not the
[49:57] Church of Jesus Christ that's right see
[49:59] we come down to our
[50:01] age and we see the ministry of Jesus
[50:04] Christ and brother brandham that's
[50:05] what's wrong with the people now see
[50:07] they can remember what was back there
[50:09] that's
[50:10] right but they'll say we don't have the
[50:12] ministry of Jesus Christ see then what
[50:14] you're doing is you're cutting off all
[50:17] the whole Ministry of Jesus Christ
[50:19] because your thoughts are built upon the
[50:21] ministry in brother Bram there'll never
[50:23] be another Ministry one person that will
[50:25] be able to do that it can't be done amen
[50:28] it won't be done I don't care who says
[50:30] it is it can't be done why because that
[50:32] would be make a prophit out of the
[50:34] person and that's not according to the
[50:36] scriptures it's unfinished am you'd be
[50:38] trying to get six or seven
[50:40] Elijah that won't work we see our minds
[50:43] is connected back to the
[50:45] thoughts of the things that the people
[50:49] of the end time
[50:52] saw amen that was the ministry of Jesus
[50:55] Christ
[50:56] but that's not what he's talking about
[50:57] here cuz he says the church
[51:01] right well you got to argue with him
[51:04] about
[51:06] it look what he goes on down to the
[51:09] faith once delivered to the to the
[51:11] Saints the holy spirit's here with the
[51:13] same Ministry that was delivered to the
[51:17] Lord look what stop by the Lord Jesus
[51:22] Christ to his apostles
[51:27] and she's come through a
[51:30] Darkness but the clouds are clearing
[51:32] back the same holy spirit is come to
[51:35] revealing the same
[51:39] thing he said the same one he passed
[51:43] out there's never been an age without
[51:45] the ministry of Jesus Christ there's
[51:46] never been an age without the Holy Ghost
[51:48] of Jesus
[51:50] Christ it may be not be in the
[51:53] manifestation I'm not saying that I've
[51:56] taught that that's what I hope you're
[51:57] catching
[52:00] on you say when well just listen to
[52:03] watch being sad when the upper room took
[52:05] place there was
[52:06] 120 right that had been two to three and
[52:09] a half years but when the Holy Ghost
[52:11] fell outside it fell on a group of
[52:14] people of 3,000 that had just heard one
[52:16] message that's right amen but it's the
[52:19] same Ministry of Jesus Christ right
[52:23] amen at least we could say that
[52:28] well I just don't see it I just don't
[52:29] see it well then what would it take for
[52:32] us to be able to see
[52:35] it
[52:37] right look what he says on Watchman what
[52:39] of the night and now the spirit of God
[52:41] in the church today is just exactly like
[52:45] it was when it was in Jesus in Christ
[52:52] Jesus same y
[52:56] do you understand what I'm trying to get
[52:58] us to a point of
[53:02] thinking get us to a point of not
[53:06] sitting down and not looking for
[53:10] something but to believe what is here
[53:12] while we're sitting down if you want to
[53:15] do it that
[53:18] way you see that's the way I see God and
[53:20] the way I see Jesus
[53:24] Christ whatever he was he still is and
[53:27] what he is he always had been that's
[53:30] right or Hebrews 13:8 is wrong right I
[53:33] just don't see it well then what what's
[53:35] wrong right I know you don't like me to
[53:38] make the statement of the point but I've
[53:40] asked you to do it sit down sometimes
[53:43] and calculate the healings that was in
[53:45] the 20 years of the book of
[53:48] Acts write down how many healings and
[53:51] miracles happen in the 20-year period
[53:56] from Calvary to the book of Acts I mean
[53:58] you know coming on over to
[54:00] the first church
[54:05] age brother random then it won't stumble
[54:07] you or throw it in the wrong way for him
[54:10] to say I've seen more in one
[54:13] service that is in the book of
[54:18] Acts Church calculate Among Us the
[54:22] things God has
[54:24] done
[54:25] some of you have been here 20 years go
[54:28] back and calculate some of the healings
[54:30] and the signs and the Wonders amen that
[54:33] has taken place that's just is in this
[54:36] group what about the whole group around
[54:37] the
[54:39] world what about the lady over there
[54:41] overseas that had that meal Barrel that
[54:43] never went
[54:47] out there's a lot of people went over
[54:49] there and tried to eat out of it see if
[54:50] he get it eat up and it didn't
[54:54] work
[54:58] see we've seen the signs and wonders
[55:00] it's Jesus
[55:01] Christ if you're ever healed it's Jesus
[55:05] Christ I don't care if you take aspir
[55:08] and get rid of the headache the aspir is
[55:10] not doing it Jesus Christ made a way
[55:13] where that would work upon the human
[55:18] body see all I'm trying to do is get us
[55:20] to a point of
[55:24] confessing
[55:28] confessing the position that we're
[55:31] in that's
[55:34] right see then I expect I've told you
[55:38] over and
[55:40] over it's a little off paraphrase I
[55:42] meant the other day and I brought it to
[55:44] you but it's not exactly word for word
[55:46] the way we always quot it but it's still
[55:49] saying the same thing I believe there'll
[55:51] come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:53] from heaven will fill every five being
[55:55] and take us into Rapture that's a quote
[55:59] it's close in the paraphrase but it's
[56:01] close enough to be
[56:03] right so I'm not sitting down not
[56:05] looking for something no I look every
[56:10] day rode by
[56:13] over yesterday and Wade was bushhoging
[56:15] and I tried to catch up with him and
[56:17] missed the road and June finally she I
[56:20] on know on the phone with her to ask her
[56:22] what road he was on and she said just go
[56:24] over there brother there where you saw
[56:25] the Lord at and turn
[56:27] right I knew right where she was
[56:31] at you remember the story I saw the Lord
[56:33] about 11 years old 11 12 years old
[56:36] somewhere
[56:37] in I went by there
[56:40] yesterday I slow
[56:43] down I said Lord thank you for meeting
[56:45] me
[56:46] there but I said Lord I thank you you
[56:49] didn't stay
[56:51] there now I don't mean he he de
[56:55] christianized nobody he didn't stay
[56:57] there see they became a denomination and
[57:00] cut it all off he had been put on
[57:02] outside that was what my thoughts right
[57:05] and I said Lord thank you for coming out
[57:07] where I'm at and getting me and bringing
[57:09] me on you know God I believe
[57:13] that I look forward to every day in
[57:16] Christ am when I pray for somebody here
[57:20] and you come up to me to be prayed for
[57:22] prayed for you when I pray for you and
[57:24] you don't get healed that makes me sick
[57:27] at my stomach
[57:28] right I don't go home blaming
[57:32] you I don't go home and say well if so
[57:35] and so hadn't been in the church maybe
[57:37] you it would have been all right I got
[57:39] the quote from the prophet where one
[57:40] person I know how to quote too I know
[57:43] you can quote yourself to
[57:46] death I blame myself when you are not
[57:52] healed and I believe if we'd ever bet
[57:54] every one of us get that idea in our
[57:56] mind to blame our own selves I believe
[57:59] we'd see more of God dealing Among Us
[58:02] right right that's
[58:04] right
[58:07] yeah but we've got all kind of things we
[58:10] can do it with you
[58:12] know you remember the brother here one
[58:14] time that said he saw the pillar of fire
[58:17] around a pool
[58:19] pit I'm not doubting
[58:23] him and he saw it two or three times
[58:26] around the pull
[58:30] pit and he told one day he said I saw
[58:33] the pillar of fire and said it was
[58:34] leaving the pull pit going
[58:39] down a brother got up later ministering
[58:43] and used a little circumstantial
[58:47] evidence and he said brother Dale the
[58:49] pillar of fire was leaving out of the
[58:53] church
[58:55] I come right back behind him and I said
[58:58] no way the pillar of fire wouldn't leave
[59:01] and out of the church it was going back
[59:03] where I wanted to go where the people's
[59:05] at it was going to the congregation
[59:08] where the people was at cuz that'll get
[59:10] it away from looking at pillars of fire
[59:13] around me and you'd believe what was
[59:15] said if there a pillar of fire hanging
[59:16] around
[59:20] me I just swear I've always tried to be
[59:23] honest
[59:27] you can't build something around some
[59:29] kind of an idea or thought that's
[59:31] circumstantial
[59:34] right well brother Dell I believe you
[59:36] this I believe you that like I told you
[59:38] twice I've approached it from this pull
[59:40] pit when people would say I was a
[59:42] prophet and I said
[59:45] no I will not have that to be brought to
[59:48] understanding in this pull pit that I
[59:50] would in any way consider myself to be a
[59:53] prophet
[59:56] why because I don't believe it well what
[59:58] are you I'm me that's the best way to
[1:00:01] say it I'm me what are you trying to
[1:00:05] find some gimmick or thing that would
[1:00:07] work and then You' say the ministry of
[1:00:09] Jesus Christ is
[1:00:14] here when brother brandham said that
[1:00:16] that
[1:00:17] day he
[1:00:19] said I'd rather see love among a group
[1:00:23] of people
[1:00:25] then five maybe if I miss it I believe
[1:00:27] it's right 5,000 Miracles or something
[1:00:32] healings in
[1:00:36] there he said he'd rather to see love
[1:00:39] amen right then the healing
[1:00:43] and you know what I told Brother Mo when
[1:00:45] he told me about the things that
[1:00:47] happened in brother Brandon's Ministry
[1:00:48] and I believed
[1:00:50] him I believed him that it took place
[1:00:53] but I said I can't depend on that that
[1:00:55] but you tell me what he taught and I'll
[1:00:57] know whether or not he was a prophet of
[1:00:59] God thank God I got a hold of somebody
[1:01:03] that could tell me what a prophet taught
[1:01:05] yes
[1:01:06] sir and I still stand on that this day
[1:01:09] to believe that what God has brought to
[1:01:12] you and I the same Ministry of Jesus
[1:01:14] Christ is here amen at least we could
[1:01:17] say it's here as the the disciples had
[1:01:20] it before Calvary amen do you understand
[1:01:25] you see what I'm talking about if it's
[1:01:27] working why can't we say it's Jesus
[1:01:31] Christ well they're not one of
[1:01:35] us might find out we're not one of
[1:01:38] us
[1:01:40] right right that's I liked old brother
[1:01:43] Theo Rasmus when he was bringing that
[1:01:45] message that time and he said said look
[1:01:48] at
[1:01:49] there he said his name is j s u
[1:01:53] s
[1:01:55] cuz he's reading the scripture about us
[1:01:57] and us and us he said his name is j s us
[1:02:01] he said you take the US off of it and
[1:02:03] said his name is
[1:02:05] Jess and he said you take me and you
[1:02:07] away from it said his name would just be
[1:02:09] Jess it wouldn't be Jesus I Glory
[1:02:12] Hallelujah I shouted about it
[1:02:15] because I always thought the prophet
[1:02:17] tried to teach us that we're a part I
[1:02:20] thought he taught us that the godhead
[1:02:21] wouldn't complete without you amen
[1:02:27] you see the prophet spoke and pointed to
[1:02:29] a church a word born
[1:02:33] bride sure we're living way below our
[1:02:35] privileges yes
[1:02:37] sir way below it right but you know what
[1:02:41] we're still
[1:02:44] here I was talking to a man at work down
[1:02:47] there one time and
[1:02:49] uh he was talking about you know the the
[1:02:51] Catholic church and the wrong and he
[1:02:53] said H it he said how many Catholics are
[1:02:55] they at that time it was like 500
[1:02:56] million or something it was way back you
[1:02:58] know and uh he said in other words
[1:03:02] you're trying to tell
[1:03:04] me that there's 500 million people's
[1:03:06] wrong and you're right I said I didn't
[1:03:08] say that but I believe
[1:03:14] it and he said you mean to tell me that
[1:03:18] God would something would hear you more
[1:03:20] than you hear them I I'm still
[1:03:23] alive
[1:03:26] I said that ever right to not
[1:03:28] be I'm still alive he come back and
[1:03:31] apologize he said I didn't mean it that
[1:03:33] way I said that's all
[1:03:36] right but listen
[1:03:39] Church we've got to confess it now we'll
[1:03:42] pick that up Sunday and going on if we
[1:03:44] don't confess it God can't do
[1:03:46] it CU now listen listen and read your
[1:03:49] Bible everything in the Bible someone
[1:03:53] confessed it it as
[1:03:56] being are you listening someone said
[1:04:03] it
[1:04:05] right the Bible is a record and has
[1:04:08] natural things in it of Life
[1:04:11] yes but inside of that is a bride of
[1:04:13] Christ or people of God that have spoken
[1:04:17] all the way down that's what Martin
[1:04:18] Luther done when he walked out there and
[1:04:20] he said the just shall live by faith he
[1:04:23] said it right
[1:04:25] God made it
[1:04:30] live God brought it on sin he made it
[1:04:33] live what if he'd never said it oh well
[1:04:36] somebody else would have Oh Glory you're
[1:04:40] great you sure a believer in God and
[1:04:42] predestination ain't
[1:04:45] you well you don't think somebody else
[1:04:47] could said it no I know they couldn't
[1:04:48] say it you know why cuz Luther said it
[1:04:50] that's right right does that solve the
[1:04:53] problem a lot of people said it but God
[1:04:56] never come on the scene to what they
[1:04:58] said but when Luther said to just shall
[1:05:00] live by faith God said Heaven opened
[1:05:03] Glory go down now and make it alive in
[1:05:06] the
[1:05:08] people cuz he said what God Said right I
[1:05:11] thought confession was to confess what
[1:05:13] God Said say what he
[1:05:17] said but I'm trying to hold it to a
[1:05:19] point tonight of understanding the one
[1:05:23] thing
[1:05:25] let me go back to it again I don't mind
[1:05:27] that I hope you do Jesus Christ gave the
[1:05:30] disciples before Calvary his
[1:05:34] ministry and it was the same Ministry he
[1:05:37] had that's
[1:05:40] right they had the ministry that he had
[1:05:43] the same one then one the day of
[1:05:46] Pentecost he came back and lived in them
[1:05:49] the same Ministry that he
[1:05:53] had
[1:05:55] right the 3,000 receive the same
[1:05:59] ministry as just a new birth
[1:06:02] babies but they begin to grow in Grace
[1:06:04] and knowledge and that lasted for four
[1:06:06] ages you hear your Prophet saying it
[1:06:09] that the pure unadulterated word lasted
[1:06:11] through the first four
[1:06:13] ages it began to dwindle down yes and
[1:06:16] going down but it last in state but see
[1:06:19] then you come out with Luther them
[1:06:20] that's why it comes out with the very
[1:06:21] first one talking to somebody the other
[1:06:23] day about why did it come out in that
[1:06:25] age and said you got a name that you're
[1:06:27] living but you're
[1:06:30] dead it was the name of Jesus that was
[1:06:33] lost not that they called him some other
[1:06:36] name not that they called him by another
[1:06:40] Jim Joe Charlie or something no it was
[1:06:42] the Revelation so the faith of the
[1:06:45] fathers was lost right down through that
[1:06:49] ages but the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:06:53] lost that great ministry that those
[1:06:55] Apostles Apostles had be to
[1:07:01] deteriorate brother RS when that said it
[1:07:03] he said the bride should have never went
[1:07:04] to
[1:07:06] NAA I know people right here that differ
[1:07:09] with me in this pull pit about that but
[1:07:10] I can't help it brother r one said it he
[1:07:13] said they come back with things they
[1:07:15] shouldn't have come back
[1:07:18] with you said people with the faith of
[1:07:20] the fathers yes people with the faith of
[1:07:22] the fathers went down to see they come
[1:07:25] out of there with just little sayings
[1:07:27] and little thoughts that begin to just
[1:07:30] Trinkle down until the faith of the
[1:07:32] fathers was
[1:07:33] lost but you never lost the ministry of
[1:07:36] Jesus Christ because it was down through
[1:07:37] every Church age and every time he was
[1:07:40] still alive still manifesting
[1:07:43] himself zeusa Street comes back and the
[1:07:45] prophet said no Messenger to the age of
[1:07:48] zeusa street he said because the Holy
[1:07:50] Ghost came himself in the fullness he he
[1:07:54] said of the
[1:07:56] baptism but he said then at end the age
[1:07:58] of messenger would
[1:08:01] come what did he start out doing read
[1:08:04] your statue of perfect man I hope you've
[1:08:06] read it over and over he says on there
[1:08:08] he said that it took him 30 years to
[1:08:11] come to that place of preaching
[1:08:15] that sure he knew about it sure he knew
[1:08:18] about the faith of the father sure he
[1:08:20] knew about adoption he had taught it
[1:08:22] before then and coming
[1:08:25] down what was it that he said he said I
[1:08:29] just got this right here the other day
[1:08:32] down in the
[1:08:33] woods
[1:08:35] what the ability to become to the
[1:08:39] stature of a perfect man right add to
[1:08:41] your faith virture knowledge Temperance
[1:08:43] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:08:46] and in
[1:08:49] love
[1:08:50] church I've taught that all along I
[1:08:53] don't understand
[1:08:56] see I've always looked for Jesus
[1:09:00] Christ but yet I know and realize if I
[1:09:03] don't confess
[1:09:06] it he can't do it oh now you man
[1:09:09] yourself something you he can't I didn't
[1:09:12] say it we'll get on it
[1:09:14] Sunday your Prophet is one that said
[1:09:17] it he said if we don't confess it he
[1:09:20] can't do it that's
[1:09:22] right
[1:09:24] somebody's got to say it do you
[1:09:27] understand what I'm saying Martin Luther
[1:09:29] come out of there right exactly in the
[1:09:31] word of God and said that just shall
[1:09:33] live by faith and God said that's it
[1:09:37] open up the doors of Heaven because a
[1:09:39] Zeus of streets coming and I'm going to
[1:09:41] pour out my spirit cuz it's started
[1:09:43] right now in Martin Luther
[1:09:47] right I can pour out my spirit then he
[1:09:50] says on All Flesh your sons and
[1:09:53] daughters
[1:09:55] what in my
[1:09:58] handmaids it go out on everybody that's
[1:10:00] why the anointing can work and go on
[1:10:02] people that's right and things can take
[1:10:05] place because God poured it out right
[1:10:08] yeah but then a prophet came on the
[1:10:12] scene and God began to
[1:10:17] restore
[1:10:19] right then and a
[1:10:22] prophet was more manifestation of
[1:10:26] God than had ever
[1:10:29] been down through time
[1:10:34] right
[1:10:36] right before all of that it had never
[1:10:39] worked the way that worked that's right
[1:10:42] the great Apostle Paul would holler a
[1:10:44] Man Out Of Glory to hear that cuz he
[1:10:47] know it's
[1:10:52] true see Church we've got to come back
[1:10:54] to the faith of the fathers before we
[1:10:56] can talk about anything
[1:10:58] else but you know what I love to hear
[1:11:00] Brother Rand make statements like I was
[1:11:02] thinking there a while ago when I said
[1:11:04] Luther said that you shall live by faith
[1:11:06] and God come
[1:11:07] down I'd like for you to go home and get
[1:11:09] the message called a
[1:11:12] Rapture either read it or listen to the
[1:11:16] tape and listen very carefully when he
[1:11:19] gets over in the
[1:11:21] message and he says he's speaking of the
[1:11:24] Rapture the
[1:11:27] change how many of you know what he
[1:11:32] said he said it has been
[1:11:35] spoken now let it come to
[1:11:39] pass you say a't that just a little bit
[1:11:42] no I believe if he hadn't come and told
[1:11:45] us that we wouldn't know how to go to a
[1:11:46] change that's right that's what I
[1:11:48] believe we' have to go by the grave
[1:11:51] somebody else have to pull us up y right
[1:11:53] right
[1:11:54] right but he said it has been spoken now
[1:11:57] let it come to
[1:11:59] pass cuz see Paul could just say change
[1:12:02] the moment twinkle of an eye he couldn't
[1:12:04] see it but when it come down to brother
[1:12:07] brandham see he seen it he just didn't
[1:12:10] get to walk into it at that place come
[1:12:13] on
[1:12:16] right do you understand the ministry of
[1:12:19] Jesus
[1:12:21] Christ and see we still left off one
[1:12:24] thing if you've listened and we're going
[1:12:27] to drop back Sunday pick up a little bit
[1:12:29] to the confession but they still a
[1:12:33] headstone even though we talk about the
[1:12:36] faith of the
[1:12:37] fathers there's a headstone to come
[1:12:40] after
[1:12:42] that there's more to
[1:12:46] come but it's more the ministry of Jesus
[1:12:49] Christ but if we don't walk now here's
[1:12:52] my lifesty statement if we can't walk
[1:12:55] now and saying Jesus Christ is alive
[1:12:59] among his bride around the world doing
[1:13:03] great signs and wonders and miracles and
[1:13:06] things
[1:13:07] happening then we're confessing him to
[1:13:09] be the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:13] amen that's right but Brother D I just
[1:13:15] can't see it I didn't know that it was
[1:13:18] to be
[1:13:19] seen I thought it was to be
[1:13:22] believed
[1:13:24] I thought the scripture says
[1:13:27] what not we see to
[1:13:29] believe it say we believe to
[1:13:32] see let us believe it and start talking
[1:13:35] about it right instead of the mey mouth
[1:13:39] down and out as brother for he said wowy
[1:13:41] wowy wowy W you
[1:13:45] know at least let say
[1:13:49] it come on we'll get to it Sunday is it
[1:13:52] right you cannot be healed if you don't
[1:13:56] say you're
[1:13:58] healed you cannot be saved according to
[1:14:01] the Book of
[1:14:02] Romans unless you confess with your
[1:14:05] mouth of what you're believing in your
[1:14:07] heart that's what
[1:14:10] says you believe it in your
[1:14:12] heart you remember the lady or who it
[1:14:15] was told the other one said I got the
[1:14:16] Holy Ghost other day but said don't tell
[1:14:19] nobody now they didn't get the Holy
[1:14:22] Ghost
[1:14:24] they didn't get the Holy Ghost right go
[1:14:26] you want to tell everybody come on
[1:14:28] musician I just want you to think about
[1:14:32] it think about what I'm trying to say
[1:14:36] the ministry of Jesus Christ let's
[1:14:38] confess it is here that's right amen it
[1:14:42] is because if we don't confess it's here
[1:14:46] what is to come will never come and if
[1:14:49] it does we don't we won't know what it
[1:14:52] is
[1:15:00] right we won't know what it
[1:15:04] is but if we confess it then God can
[1:15:07] that's right come upon our
[1:15:09] confession now think about that
[1:15:11] scripture and read it if you can he
[1:15:13] maketh intercession Upon Our
[1:15:19] confession all right now if that's plain
[1:15:24] sense then what does it
[1:15:29] mean if we got plain Common Sense what
[1:15:32] does it mean when you say that he makes
[1:15:36] intercession Upon Our
[1:15:39] confession that means if you don't
[1:15:42] confess it he ain't making no
[1:15:48] intercession
[1:15:52] right you say yeah well I've got the
[1:15:54] Holy Ghost all right keep confessing for
[1:15:57] more all right what do we got 369 let's
