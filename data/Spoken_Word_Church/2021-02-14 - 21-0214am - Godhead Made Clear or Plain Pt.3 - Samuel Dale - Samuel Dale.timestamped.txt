[3:33] the point lord to reveal yourself and
[3:35] make a make us to be
[3:38] to the point that we want to more just
[3:40] know about you
[3:42] is our desire forgive our sins cleanse
[3:45] us and bless each one
[3:47] and guide each and every one need just
[3:49] lead the sick
[3:51] and have your way in your love we know
[3:54] it's one of your attributes
[3:56] to display a healer so we don't have to
[3:59] worry about
[4:00] asking and wondering if it can be done
[4:03] we know it is already finished and we
[4:06] love you and we thank you in jesus name
[4:08] amen hebrews we've been on this for a
[4:12] little while and
[4:14] i don't know how much more we'll stay
[4:16] but we'll go to verse
[4:18] 3 of hebrews 10. but in those sacrifices
[4:23] there's a remembrance you know the the
[4:25] law of the shadows and the things
[4:29] again made of sins every year
[4:32] see it just keeps piling up it's no good
[4:35] all right
[4:36] for it is not possible that the blood of
[4:38] bulls and of goats
[4:40] should take away sins wherefore when he
[4:43] cometh into the world
[4:44] he says sacrifice and offering thou
[4:47] wouldest not
[4:48] but a body has thou prepared me
[4:51] a way for a redeemer
[4:56] to be made manifest and come forth was
[4:59] made possible in
[5:00] the lord jesus okay let's go to
[5:02] ephesians
[5:06] 5 what have we got um
[5:10] 10 22 22 all right
[5:17] let's go verse 21 submitting yourselves
[5:20] one to another
[5:21] in the fear of god wives submit
[5:23] yourselves
[5:25] unto your own husband as unto the lord
[5:29] for the husband is the head of the wife
[5:31] even as christ is the head of the
[5:33] the church and he is the savior of the
[5:37] body
[5:38] therefore as the church is subject unto
[5:40] christ
[5:41] so let the wives be to their own
[5:43] husbands into
[5:44] in everything husbands love your wives
[5:48] even as christ also loved the church and
[5:50] gave himself for
[5:52] it that he might sanctified and cleanse
[5:55] it with a washing of the water of the
[5:56] word let's just stop there
[5:58] because we know what it's dealing with
[6:00] because we're talking about and want to
[6:02] talk today a little bit about the body
[6:04] and things and we know that paul was
[6:08] using the wife and the husband
[6:10] as a type of christ in the church
[6:12] because that's what we want to deal with
[6:14] today
[6:14] we want to talk about the body and
[6:16] dealing with it and knowing that uh
[6:20] there had to be a an atonement made
[6:23] so as it was then jesus christ the human
[6:25] body came into existence
[6:28] to pay the price all right so then
[6:31] that's not all of it either
[6:33] because see god can't be without a body
[6:37] once he unites or brings himself forth
[6:39] into a
[6:40] position or situation or character
[6:43] or attribute or whatever words you want
[6:47] to use once he
[6:48] comes to that place he cannot back up
[6:51] it will always be there because when
[6:53] even when we get there
[6:56] it won't do away because we're going to
[6:57] see the nail prints in his hand
[7:00] now that's something isn't it to where
[7:02] that we'll know all about it okay
[7:04] you may be seated lord add his blessing
[7:06] to the reading of the word
[7:07] you know that's what i want to do i want
[7:11] us to think on
[7:15] the body because god cannot be
[7:19] without a body now when he was back
[7:22] before the foundation of the world
[7:25] and dealing with that and coming down uh
[7:28] he had a body he lived in a body
[7:32] but that body was not a human element
[7:36] 16 elements as we call it not a human
[7:38] body
[7:39] it was a body it was a place that he
[7:42] lived he dwelt there
[7:44] and and i believe that he was you know
[7:47] uh
[7:47] in what we would call to come on later
[7:49] picking up the word theophany or
[7:51] something like that
[7:52] to try to express it but to me it's the
[7:54] best way to express it is just to think
[7:56] about it a little bit
[7:58] because he had to come forth to be able
[8:02] to
[8:02] make the atonement all right
[8:05] and pay the price and to do that and see
[8:08] then we've been through
[8:09] studying about adam and how that god
[8:12] made him and things happened back there
[8:14] and then see we was we dwelt a long time
[8:17] i
[8:18] sometimes i want to just sit down and uh
[8:22] maybe it would be good to just say it
[8:24] like this and i will because i think
[8:25] about it that a
[8:26] lot is just sit down and put
[8:30] step one step two step three four five
[8:33] and come through the bible and to see
[8:36] the
[8:36] the natural things
[8:40] that have taken place you know the
[8:42] atonements the things the
[8:44] the crucifixions the things like that
[8:47] that were natural
[8:48] things to transpire
[8:51] that god had in his mind as wade was
[8:54] bringing out
[8:55] there the other night no wednesday you
[8:56] know of being in his mind
[8:59] and in that part then uh you know you
[9:02] can see that
[9:03] he had these things in his mind but then
[9:05] he would bring it forth into a natural
[9:07] thing
[9:08] and then you can read the bible
[9:12] i see the problem with people trying to
[9:15] read the bible
[9:16] is they're trying to figure out what
[9:18] it's saying
[9:20] amen there let me be an odd way of doing
[9:23] what i approach it but i always approach
[9:25] everything kind of odd anyway
[9:27] but you know we're not supposed to try
[9:30] to figure out
[9:33] the bible we're supposed to read it
[9:36] believe it study it thank god for it
[9:41] and just let it be there with us all the
[9:43] way through
[9:44] and and it's not something that we do
[9:47] but there
[9:47] is a natural story i was thinking a lot
[9:50] about this
[9:52] recently the bible has a natural
[9:56] story natural things
[10:00] if you'd read it like that and read that
[10:03] here is this
[10:04] and here is this and here's this and
[10:06] here comes adam and here comes eve and
[10:08] here comes
[10:09] those were things that were natural
[10:13] happenings and it came all the way
[10:16] through that you had a david you had all
[10:18] of the
[10:18] the things you had a goliath you had a
[10:20] killing and all like that you had
[10:22] those were natural things
[10:26] all right and see pointing on down and
[10:28] then finally here
[10:30] would come jesus christ into the world
[10:33] in a human form as a natural
[10:37] person you know a human being
[10:40] amen he just wouldn't come in there and
[10:43] then just stand up and you know well i'm
[10:44] it couldn't be touched or whatever no he
[10:47] had that story about him
[10:49] it's a natural there's a natural story
[10:51] to the bible
[10:53] and when you're reading it if you just
[10:55] read it and say
[10:56] well you know this took place
[11:01] this happened here's where david come in
[11:04] and look what he'd done and look what
[11:05] happened
[11:06] and look like the things that he'd done
[11:08] and all like that and look at
[11:09] abraham a friend of god
[11:13] look at all of the things that took
[11:14] place in the time as what we call
[11:17] the bible as it's being made being
[11:21] written
[11:21] or brought into being you know and
[11:24] see it didn't end when jesus christ came
[11:28] that was the fulfillment of it to bring
[11:30] it into being to where we could see
[11:33] more our day well you know what i think
[11:36] about is
[11:36] is what we've we've talked about in in
[11:39] the
[11:39] past few services on back about you know
[11:42] we talk about the
[11:43] the the woman in the white house well
[11:46] we're living
[11:47] in a day and i tried to explain it then
[11:50] we're living
[11:50] in a day when literally the bible
[11:54] is still being written
[11:58] you realize by that being prophesied by
[12:00] the prophet
[12:02] that they'd come that time then that
[12:05] would have to take place
[12:07] because it's the word of god and then
[12:10] being in having to take place
[12:11] see then it would be something natural
[12:16] all right something natural would have
[12:18] to take place
[12:19] there would have to be a time that
[12:20] there'd be a lady in the white house
[12:23] well then that puts us living
[12:26] exactly the word of god as it's being
[12:30] written it's still being written
[12:35] every time a born-again believer comes
[12:37] into the body of christ
[12:40] you realize that you're doing the the
[12:42] scripture wade was using the other day
[12:44] and was with the incontinence was my
[12:47] members
[12:48] fashion when you back there you know and
[12:50] each one coming forth
[12:53] and as each person comes into the body
[12:55] of christ
[12:56] except in jesus christ that's part of
[12:58] the bible being fulfilled
[13:02] why don't you think of yourself like
[13:03] that
[13:05] we're living in a time when it is being
[13:08] made
[13:09] manifest it's not just talking about it
[13:12] we read about it we talked about the
[13:14] woman in the white house
[13:16] we laughed at the uh that it couldn't be
[13:19] a pretty hillary because he was too ugly
[13:21] and
[13:22] we we've done all the natural things
[13:26] but you know what
[13:29] it's reality
[13:32] that's right read the bible like a a
[13:35] book that's
[13:37] being written now
[13:41] see when you come into the body of
[13:42] christ that puts your name in the book
[13:44] amen right
[13:49] this just trying to get you to think
[13:51] about something because you know
[13:53] that's the way it is see god can't
[13:57] he doesn't exist or unless our word
[14:00] can't
[14:01] to a lot of people knocks them in the
[14:03] head and they they think well you're
[14:05] saying that god can't do this
[14:07] no god won't do it all right
[14:11] god exists in a situation to where
[14:14] that he can manifest himself any way he
[14:17] wants to
[14:18] but yet he can't come no other way than
[14:21] what the word says
[14:23] so if we see our day where are days in
[14:26] the word
[14:27] it's written see what's taking place
[14:30] today is in the word
[14:31] yes all right see then uh you know we
[14:34] we can look forward uh peggy was asking
[14:37] me some questions the other day about
[14:39] the
[14:39] uh the tribulation and the
[14:41] pre-tribulations and
[14:43] and the things you know and we we just
[14:44] begin to talk about
[14:46] uh things that uh could be expected
[14:50] see we're not in the tribulation
[14:53] don't think that if we're in the
[14:55] tribulation we don't miss the rapture
[14:59] but just remember like i've always tried
[15:01] to tell you see we look at things and
[15:03] and we see something and and we try to
[15:06] figure it out
[15:08] well i've just always just been natural
[15:10] in my thinking
[15:11] and if you'll be natural into reading
[15:13] the bible then
[15:14] it can be made manifest or known what
[15:18] it's talking about
[15:20] because see you you'd come through the
[15:22] bible just i'm hung on this so i'm gonna
[15:24] get it out of the way
[15:25] uh you take see
[15:28] you've got the creation of the world
[15:32] and then you got adam and eve created
[15:35] well see that's not an addition to the
[15:38] bible
[15:40] but it is one thing for certain adam and
[15:43] eve came forth into a physical
[15:45] manifestation
[15:46] amen you know alive they became alive
[15:50] all right see then they can can be alive
[15:53] and we can go through a lot of the
[15:54] others
[15:55] but now here's my point the
[15:59] god back before the world
[16:02] he was an elohim the self-existing
[16:05] the great i am the great jehovah god
[16:10] and he wanted to dwell with his people
[16:13] he was lonely he wanted to dwell with
[16:16] his people
[16:18] all right so we begin to
[16:21] bring forth his thoughts
[16:26] he began to bring forth his uh
[16:30] manifestations and bring it into being
[16:33] all right and here as those things are
[16:36] brought into being
[16:37] we can see how he unfolds himself and
[16:40] coming down to where we're living
[16:42] so god has never been to the basis
[16:45] that he didn't have a body now now
[16:47] here's we're going to start with that
[16:48] just a little bit and try to get on it
[16:50] but he's never been to a place that he
[16:52] didn't have a body
[16:54] it may not have been a 16 element
[16:59] you know he may have existed in a
[17:02] theophany but
[17:03] the prophet called that a body
[17:07] he may have existed in other forms
[17:11] but the thing about it was he existed he
[17:14] had a body
[17:16] but that was not the way that he wanted
[17:19] it
[17:21] so he turned it around
[17:25] and began to manifest it the way
[17:28] that he wanted it as i was going to say
[17:31] about adam
[17:32] and eve you see a natural story over
[17:34] here
[17:35] but then here comes a spiritual
[17:36] happening
[17:38] then you start thinking about adam and
[17:40] eve and
[17:41] you start thinking about the the times
[17:44] and the creation and what it was
[17:46] and you begin to see how they lived
[17:49] and see how that we can live and how our
[17:52] being all right
[17:53] get the point now see god has always had
[17:57] a body
[18:01] all right but never had it like he
[18:04] wanted it
[18:05] because he could not make manifest all
[18:08] of his attributes
[18:10] right until he come forth into a
[18:13] manifestation
[18:15] and and say the healer the deliverer
[18:17] there's
[18:18] the savior the attributes and the things
[18:21] that god would
[18:22] uh bring forth you know and make
[18:24] manifest
[18:25] in in in life
[18:28] and see as he's doing that he's writing
[18:31] the bible
[18:34] so that we later could be able to read
[18:37] that
[18:39] and see that there was a living reality
[18:41] back there
[18:44] like i said god had a body he had a way
[18:47] of living
[18:48] he lived in a form back there before
[18:51] that he ever started creating anything
[18:55] i don't think he was just a wind blowing
[18:57] and just floating around
[18:58] and just something like that you know
[19:01] the prophet said he's a being
[19:04] so he's not like the wind he said well
[19:08] at one time he was like no
[19:10] he never was a time that god was not
[19:13] real
[19:15] that's where we try to figure out
[19:18] there's where we read the story then we
[19:20] try to comprehend the story
[19:23] without going to a spiritual revelation
[19:26] to understand what's going on
[19:30] we're going to the point of trying to
[19:31] figure it out ourselves all right
[19:33] but you see he's always had a way of
[19:39] living it wasn't that he was
[19:43] non-existent
[19:44] then he come into existence i've never
[19:47] believed nothing like that
[19:48] because if he ever was god he still is
[19:50] god now we know we use the word god
[19:53] okay see we're so smart we use the word
[19:55] well he wasn't god
[19:57] god is an object of worship see
[20:01] you're getting into those that are
[20:02] saying a moment ago trying to figure
[20:04] things out
[20:06] when brother branham would say god
[20:11] well he's not god see we're so smart but
[20:14] brother random had a way of preaching
[20:16] he said god was the self-existing
[20:20] god was the great elohim god was not he
[20:23] didn't have no problem using the word
[20:25] god
[20:29] but yet we're actually correcting him
[20:32] in the basis of us saying well but god's
[20:34] not god until he created some
[20:37] all right the prophet said the first
[20:38] thing he created was angels
[20:44] he said that made him god said they
[20:45] worshipped him
[20:47] all right
[20:50] but if you think about the children of
[20:52] god
[20:53] the children of god existed before the
[20:56] angels
[20:58] so now you've got two creations that's
[21:02] what i'm telling you
[21:03] we try to figure things out
[21:08] instead of just accepting it like it is
[21:11] and read it the bible the message the
[21:14] thing
[21:15] read it and let god then come on the
[21:17] scene
[21:18] in that and
[21:22] reveal himself through that to me and
[21:24] you
[21:25] because that's what we're here for he
[21:28] created us for a purpose
[21:33] then he began his own part of bringing
[21:35] his own self into being
[21:37] where we could see something tangible
[21:40] see something real
[21:44] all right see that's why i said don't
[21:47] ever think that there was a time that
[21:48] god didn't exist
[21:52] well how did he exist he existed the way
[21:56] he needed to be or was
[22:02] you say you mean to tell me that you
[22:04] think that god one time
[22:06] existed i do what do you think where did
[22:09] he come from and
[22:10] what is your thoughts i believe that
[22:12] back before the foundation of the world
[22:14] and all i can
[22:15] that god was there
[22:19] more real than you and me are now
[22:24] but he was existing alone
[22:27] he had the attributes within him right
[22:30] and he wanted to display them
[22:32] and you know to bring him out that was
[22:34] great but he existed alone
[22:36] but yet he did exist
[22:40] and he had a body to live in back there
[22:44] but not the kind of body that he wanted
[22:47] to do
[22:48] all right see even adam and eve
[22:52] in the way that they done and sinned he
[22:55] didn't want that sinful body
[22:59] but yet it was placed in there all right
[23:02] but see one day something happened now
[23:05] here's my point that all that's to say
[23:07] one thing
[23:09] when i read in hebrews 10 5 there and it
[23:12] says
[23:12] a body has thou prepared me
[23:19] god provided his own body
[23:24] adam and eve didn't create him a body
[23:27] mary never created him a body
[23:31] we can't create him a body
[23:34] but yet if we go along with the story of
[23:37] what we're looking at
[23:38] and see how he come into manifestation
[23:41] you can see that still he is here
[23:44] now in his body and this
[23:47] is the body that he wanted to have here
[23:53] well i don't have a problem with this
[23:56] old flesh
[23:58] my brother uh richard wilson used to
[24:00] like cause some of us to say it
[24:01] he said y'all said old flush flush
[24:04] the flesh you know but think about it
[24:08] what i'm trying to get a point to you is
[24:10] one thing
[24:12] don't think god had a beginning
[24:16] he never had a beginning he always was
[24:18] god
[24:20] all right now don't think that there was
[24:23] a time that he didn't exist
[24:25] in a body
[24:28] he existed in a bodily form back but a
[24:31] bodily form that's different from this
[24:33] form
[24:34] you can call it a theophany you can call
[24:36] it those things
[24:38] you know the one i like is to get into
[24:42] those words like that
[24:43] and look up logos and find out the word
[24:46] logos means speech
[24:50] that's a thrill to me to know that
[24:54] that word word
[24:58] is speech all right
[25:02] god was real that's that's my whole
[25:04] point i was trying to get a little
[25:05] little statement in right here then
[25:07] we'll start reading something
[25:09] god is real he
[25:12] never existed to worry that he was not
[25:15] real
[25:16] that's right he was real
[25:20] all right see then he began to he was
[25:23] not satisfied to stay
[25:25] in that position or situation or
[25:28] whatever you want to call it
[25:30] he didn't want to stay that way
[25:34] he had his thoughts
[25:38] he created angels
[25:41] he had a lot of things that he created
[25:46] right well yet he wasn't happy
[25:52] he was living there in a body
[25:56] but he wasn't satisfied in that form
[26:01] he wanted to be kin folks
[26:04] you know what see everybody now wants to
[26:07] try to find out who their ancestors are
[26:10] you know
[26:11] i mean i get tickled at all that they
[26:13] don't find out who they are and they
[26:14] find out who they are they want to deny
[26:15] them
[26:16] but uh you know
[26:20] but think about it god wanted to make
[26:23] himself
[26:25] tangible
[26:29] he could live in a in an existing
[26:31] situation
[26:32] with us he did with adam and eve in the
[26:35] garden
[26:37] he come down in the cool of the day
[26:41] so then he had a body in the garden
[26:44] when he walked with them but he wasn't
[26:47] satisfied
[26:50] see that shows my point of what i'm
[26:52] talking about that god always
[26:54] existed in a body god always had
[26:57] some form or bodily form
[27:02] but the difference is in the elements
[27:04] and the different things
[27:05] see while he was there in the garden
[27:07] with adam and eve he was not in a
[27:09] 16-element physical body
[27:13] but yet he was real if they could talk
[27:16] to him he could fellowship with him
[27:20] so the body he had back there was a
[27:23] wonderful situation
[27:25] but it was not what he wanted to stay
[27:30] he didn't want to stay to the bases that
[27:32] he just had adam and eve to the point
[27:34] like that
[27:34] and he could come down every day it was
[27:36] all coming forth to what he wanted
[27:41] he wanted a family
[27:46] he wanted people he wanted somebody to
[27:50] love him
[27:52] the angels they were created
[27:55] they could worship him
[27:58] but that was still not what he wanted
[28:03] they said adam and eve they could do
[28:05] this that the other and worship god
[28:06] that wasn't still within it he had to
[28:10] allow
[28:11] sin to enter the picture
[28:16] he had to allow sin to enter the picture
[28:22] to where he could come forth and
[28:25] manifest himself
[28:26] in the way he wanted
[28:30] that odd he had to permit sin
[28:34] to enter the picture to bring forth the
[28:36] body that he wanted
[28:39] us to be in
[28:42] he doesn't want us today just being a
[28:44] theophany floating around or this that
[28:46] or the other
[28:48] we're not supposed to be there we're
[28:50] human beings
[28:53] we're the children of god
[28:58] hmm
[29:01] but think about it god has always had
[29:07] some form whatever that you could call a
[29:11] body
[29:16] but then he makes emphasis
[29:20] and shows us that a body
[29:24] that's stuff provided me
[29:27] god made a body
[29:31] through the virgin birth through the
[29:34] not a creating remember how we kept
[29:36] bringing those things out
[29:38] adam and eve created full-grown and i
[29:41] created a baby then grown up
[29:43] but jesus was begotten
[29:46] and he started life as a baby but you
[29:49] know what there was jehovah
[29:52] laying in a cradle there was the body
[29:57] that he wanted then he would have to
[30:00] wait and let that body grow up let that
[30:02] age come on and let the things happen
[30:05] and it looks like that he ordered just
[30:07] to wipe this off and wipe that off and
[30:09] and made the whole thing come out right
[30:11] no he that wouldn't have been what he
[30:13] wanted
[30:17] now i i want you to think with me on
[30:21] something that the way that here this
[30:23] whole human mind thinks
[30:25] you know there's no other way
[30:29] now listen there's no other way this
[30:32] thing could have happened than the way
[30:33] it happened
[30:40] now let that's just just let that
[30:43] thought run through your mind
[30:47] if there was any other way of doing it
[30:49] he would have done it that way
[30:53] so even sin entering the picture as i've
[30:56] always said
[30:57] tried to quote to you that brother ryan
[30:58] said god did not curse eve
[31:00] and adam
[31:03] how could he curse him when he'd already
[31:05] put eternal life in their soul
[31:09] that's why i emphasized that so much he
[31:11] put that eternal life he couldn't curse
[31:16] them
[31:18] brother run said he can't curse you
[31:21] he said you got eternal life
[31:24] thank you that's a wonderful situation
[31:27] but see what i'm talking about
[31:29] the scripture says a body thou has
[31:31] provided it finally came
[31:35] after a four thousand year period
[31:39] it came to a being that would be the one
[31:42] that would be the body like he wanted
[31:48] all right
[31:52] so he brought into being a body
[31:56] that he could come and dwell in
[32:03] it had to wait a while for all the
[32:04] things to made manifest i
[32:06] tried to preach that to you where like
[32:08] the river jordans and the things like
[32:10] that
[32:11] sure those things are great he wasn't
[32:14] the great eternal
[32:15] elohim self-existing almighty god in
[32:17] manifestation
[32:19] on the river jordan
[32:22] he was a human being but god was
[32:25] dwelling in there that was the elohim
[32:27] that self-existing the almighty the old
[32:29] thing
[32:29] was dwelling in that body
[32:36] see i'm trying to preach the god head if
[32:37] you understand what i've been trying to
[32:40] do to understand that
[32:44] he's father son and holy ghost and
[32:46] without those three attributes
[32:49] he's not real
[32:52] all right see then he comes down
[32:56] and he brings into being the body that
[32:59] he desired that body that was hebrews 10
[33:02] 5 is speaking of that a body thou hast
[33:04] provided
[33:06] that was god's plan and purpose
[33:10] he was going to make that body
[33:14] bring it into being
[33:18] so he's always had a body
[33:21] it's just the way we use the terms and
[33:24] the thoughts
[33:26] we think well no he was just back there
[33:28] he just floating around he was just
[33:30] he just wasn't done no no
[33:33] whatever he was back there is more real
[33:35] than we are now
[33:40] see to think about now the body that
[33:44] thou has provided god provided a body
[33:49] and that body was the lord jesus christ
[33:52] in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[33:55] bodily
[33:56] in that body
[34:00] and that body was not eternal because it
[34:04] had a beginning
[34:06] all right one day he was crucified
[34:12] went to the grave all the things but
[34:14] when he come forth from there and
[34:16] ascended on high
[34:19] there is when he reached his position
[34:22] of a body
[34:25] because there it was all made eternal
[34:29] see that's the point i'm trying to get
[34:31] if you don't forget anything get out of
[34:32] the messy today you get one thing
[34:34] god has a plan and purpose for you
[34:41] i'll give you the quote where the
[34:42] prophet was talking about it in the
[34:44] fullness of the godhead bodily
[34:47] he said he couldn't do it in the days of
[34:48] luther
[34:52] he said he couldn't do it in the days of
[34:53] wesley
[34:55] that he couldn't do it in the days of
[34:57] the pentecostal
[35:00] couldn't do what couldn't bring forth
[35:02] the way he wanted
[35:07] see you and i when we walk off of this
[35:11] earth
[35:12] in a glorified condition then the body
[35:15] of god will be in reality
[35:19] oh that just runs all the way that way
[35:22] and goes all the way that way
[35:28] but see a body has not provided for me
[35:32] that's what jesus was saying
[35:36] was he speaking to another person
[35:40] was he trying to figure it out with the
[35:42] second or third person what to do or
[35:44] whatever
[35:47] now there's where we have to take the
[35:48] story and let the prophet explain
[35:51] because we can't do it as i said we try
[35:55] to
[35:55] make these things we can't do it
[35:58] that's what i'm talking about the bible
[36:01] read the bible
[36:06] naturally just read it naturally
[36:10] and you'll see the most marvelous
[36:12] beautiful picture
[36:14] that starts out there in genesis and it
[36:17] begins to unfold
[36:21] and all of these people
[36:26] that have lived and been part of god's
[36:29] plan
[36:31] they're just making it manifest
[36:34] you and i are making it manifest now
[36:40] see we've got to we've got to be to the
[36:42] basis that we've got to have the change
[36:43] of these bodies
[36:45] because it won't fit this way all right
[36:48] that's fine we just have a change in the
[36:49] body but the thing about it is we've got
[36:51] to first get to the point that
[36:52] that we can realize and believe that we
[36:55] are the body of christ
[36:59] come on church wake up to one point
[37:04] we baptist taught that the bride we
[37:06] didn't know the word the bride
[37:08] we called it the church but we taught
[37:12] that
[37:13] that christ would come and live in a
[37:15] person
[37:16] and once that would be finished then we
[37:18] would all go to a glorified state
[37:21] somewhere
[37:22] in a glory land oh happy hunting ground
[37:24] of the indian or whatever it was
[37:27] we taught those things we talked about a
[37:30] change
[37:35] see see then when i read it where it
[37:38] says the body thou hast provided me
[37:41] i see god provided a fleshly human
[37:45] element a body
[37:48] that we call jesus
[37:55] right he created that and brought it
[37:58] into being
[37:59] that was the body that he wanted
[38:05] yeah we had already messed up the story
[38:08] the the picture was
[38:10] already in bad shape you know the cap
[38:12] and the tree
[38:13] and all of that and the other we don't
[38:14] have everything messed up
[38:16] because we tried to figure it out
[38:18] ourselves
[38:23] if you understand what i'm talking about
[38:25] start reading in genesis
[38:26] and then just just let your mind float
[38:29] and just
[38:30] go from genesis and the things that's
[38:32] happening and then jump over to abraham
[38:36] about 12 13 14.
[38:40] getting on into there you see a
[38:43] spiritual thing taking place
[38:45] you see something is marvelously
[38:47] happening that the word of god has told
[38:49] you the literal things
[38:51] it ain't going to put us in the rapture
[38:53] for the white house to be full of women
[38:59] i mean i don't care if they get a half a
[39:01] dozen presidents and what they do
[39:03] i'm not against none of that i have
[39:04] nothing no problems but i know one thing
[39:07] for certain that's not going to put me
[39:08] in the rapture
[39:12] but when i come to the place that i
[39:14] finally come to the situation
[39:16] that there's a reality of revelation
[39:18] into my heart that i
[39:19] am god's body
[39:26] now come on jesus is not here
[39:30] if he was here he couldn't be here in a
[39:31] physical body right is that that's the
[39:33] way the prophet explains it
[39:35] he you know he said these people saying
[39:37] they got blood running out and he said
[39:38] no i said if you've done that said you'd
[39:40] have jesus in the literal and he said
[39:41] you can't do that
[39:47] but you just think about we are the body
[39:50] of christ
[39:55] i can take this here's the book here's
[39:57] what i'm talking about reading this and
[39:59] coming through it
[40:00] take this and read what the prophet had
[40:02] to say
[40:03] about how jesus came and what he was
[40:07] that he was the fullness of the godhead
[40:09] bodily
[40:14] in a human flesh
[40:18] called the son of god i thought we were
[40:24] his children
[40:26] then we would be the sons and daughters
[40:28] of the living god
[40:31] as paul was doing to them on mars hill
[40:33] he said
[40:34] some of your points have said we are you
[40:36] are we are his offspring
[40:42] we are the children of god
[40:46] we are the people that couldn't happen
[40:48] in the days of luther
[40:50] they never had the revelation correct
[40:52] about the chains of different things
[40:54] because like i said we could talk about
[40:56] these things in the baptists and all
[40:58] but we still couldn't see it because we
[41:00] couldn't get the godhead straight
[41:04] we couldn't get the rest of the word
[41:05] straight but we have no excuse now
[41:11] we have the prophet's message we have no
[41:13] excuse
[41:15] to say i can't understand or it's just a
[41:18] mystery to me about god
[41:20] what is a mystery
[41:23] a mystery is something that is
[41:25] withholding until our revelation comes
[41:27] but when the revelation comes it's not a
[41:29] mystery anymore
[41:39] see a body jesus came to a position
[41:42] there
[41:43] that he lived in a human body
[41:49] he growed up he became the sacrifice
[41:56] and looked like he was destroying the
[41:58] thing
[42:00] did he come to do because he just gave
[42:03] his life
[42:08] because now listen what i'm saying
[42:12] he gave his life so the next stage of
[42:16] the story would be correct
[42:20] that it could be that a body thou has
[42:23] provided
[42:24] me
[42:28] jesus was that human body right
[42:31] in him with the whole reconciling the
[42:33] world all the time
[42:35] god was in christ doing those things
[42:39] but when he died
[42:42] and resurrected he's not here in a
[42:46] physical form
[42:48] he's not you're in a corporal body right
[42:53] but he has a body
[42:57] who is it we are his body we've always
[43:00] taught that
[43:01] when are we going to believe it
[43:05] we've always talked about the body of
[43:07] christ
[43:08] preached about it taught about it sung
[43:11] about it
[43:12] wrote songs great things
[43:16] just about the body of christ
[43:23] because when it happened there what
[43:25] would have took place had he went back
[43:27] up and
[43:28] and didn't have a body
[43:34] so he went up and a few days later he
[43:36] came back
[43:41] he came back to a body
[43:44] called the church the bride of christ
[43:52] he wouldn't left without a body
[43:57] and he says about this body that the
[43:58] greater things that we could do than
[44:00] what he done
[44:02] and we argue about what that means
[44:06] instead of reading what the prophet says
[44:08] about it and knowing what it means
[44:12] we know he's saying that it was in many
[44:14] members over here whereas the lord jesus
[44:16] was just one
[44:22] you see church we talk about the body we
[44:25] talk about what it is
[44:26] but we are his body
[44:32] and the way i think of it is like this i
[44:33] think of it in one way
[44:35] because here is my point we come to a
[44:39] day
[44:39] in time we can say well this could mean
[44:43] this and this could mean that and
[44:45] and my brother you want to go talk to
[44:47] him
[44:48] he'll say it like this he'll say uh um
[44:52] well those virgins all over the world
[44:56] but there's many virgin girls had babies
[45:00] i said you just lied and he's a 14-year
[45:04] theologian
[45:06] in the methodist seminary i said you
[45:09] just lied
[45:11] i said because that can't be
[45:15] well you know we had neighbors down
[45:17] there that had that had babies and never
[45:19] had no husband i said they lied
[45:24] i said that ain't the point the point is
[45:28] the virgin birth is for the one lord
[45:30] jesus christ
[45:32] now we have a spiritual birth
[45:35] that brings us into a virgin condition
[45:38] existence
[45:40] the born-again believer
[45:44] see he just stepped out of that body
[45:48] you say well people that say you know
[45:50] well if if jesus was god how could he
[45:52] die he didn't die jesus
[45:56] jesus would be the the god when you're
[45:58] using it but then it turns right back
[46:00] around and saying that jesus
[46:01] is the body
[46:04] see it's according what you're talking
[46:05] about
[46:10] see i don't have to look in a mirror to
[46:12] try to figure out and go in the bathroom
[46:14] you know
[46:14] and look up who am i praying to today
[46:17] well i got a picture here i got a
[46:18] picture here got a yeah i got one of
[46:20] brother random oh here we'll try that
[46:21] out in a while
[46:23] you say you're joking you're crazy no i
[46:26] ain't
[46:27] because that's what we do
[46:32] but listen church
[46:35] the lord jesus christ was the body of
[46:40] god it was the
[46:43] situation coming to existence
[46:49] that god could live with man
[46:56] god could come down and live
[47:00] with man
[47:03] that he could dwell with us
[47:06] and he could call us his children
[47:11] see he never left then without a body
[47:12] because quick as that body left and
[47:14] exited out and went up
[47:17] in the resurrection a few days later
[47:19] here he comes back
[47:24] into the body now i'm going to say this
[47:27] so i want you to listen
[47:30] see on the day of pentecost come into
[47:32] reality the body
[47:34] as well as what the bible said a body
[47:36] thou has prepared me because on the day
[47:38] of pentecost
[47:39] a bride came forth
[47:44] a church a bride came forth
[47:49] to be the people of god
[47:52] to be his children to be his offspring
[47:55] to be his
[47:56] body that he could live in
[48:00] so he wasn't left without a body
[48:04] you are his body
[48:09] when are we going to realize that and
[48:12] think about us as being reality and real
[48:14] as i'm saying a minute ago and seeing
[48:16] things in our day that we can say
[48:19] the prophet stood and told us these
[48:21] things oh you can argue what
[48:23] he said it like this one time he said in
[48:25] 50 something
[48:26] he said russia's got
[48:30] jet airplanes we knew that because
[48:35] you know the the when they divided
[48:38] what was it berlin or whatever they got
[48:41] so many of the scientists we got so many
[48:43] of the scientists and
[48:44] and they were smart the russians got a
[48:46] lot of those things
[48:48] but he said they had flying saucers
[48:54] right what about your prophet talking
[48:58] about flying saucers
[49:01] oh they're just a physicist of your
[49:02] imagination that is
[49:05] he talked about it you know what that
[49:07] was to me
[49:08] writing of the bible
[49:13] but then here one day comes forth a
[49:15] statement that
[49:16] a woman will be in the white house oh
[49:19] can't be done
[49:20] that was back before the what what is
[49:22] that word suffering
[49:24] or whatever what it means is women's
[49:25] right to vote
[49:28] i wonder how many of you women think
[49:30] about what brother branham said
[49:34] and i'm not against this that or the
[49:36] other i don't vote
[49:38] i don't fool with none of that i just
[49:40] try to preach to get you to see who you
[49:43] are
[49:49] brother brown said the worst mistake
[49:50] that was ever made
[49:55] was giving the woman the right to vote
[49:58] now how many of you women thinking about
[50:00] that
[50:00] i don't like that
[50:04] i don't i don't he could have said it
[50:06] some other way
[50:12] well if i was a woman then i just wasn't
[50:15] fooled with going down and registered to
[50:16] vote
[50:20] but that's my privilege
[50:26] silly too you say
[50:29] are you against women voting no they got
[50:31] no problem
[50:33] i got one thing for sure by the women
[50:35] voting
[50:36] came to pass what the prophet said
[50:40] oh if the women had not had the right to
[50:43] vote they would have never been a woman
[50:45] in the white house
[50:46] so the prophet would have been wrong
[50:48] when he said a woman in the white house
[50:53] do you get what i'm talking about
[51:02] see by the giving the right to the women
[51:04] to vote they brought in all of the
[51:06] things
[51:07] that's not being against it i don't even
[51:09] vote myself that's what i'm saying
[51:12] that's your privilege i ain't saying for
[51:14] nobody not to vote or to vote or
[51:16] whatever to do
[51:21] i'm trying to preach something to get us
[51:22] to see who we are
[51:27] now wouldn't it be a shame for somebody
[51:29] to come up and
[51:31] here i've been pastoring a church now
[51:33] for 40 years and
[51:35] and here they come up with something try
[51:36] to give me a special deal
[51:39] let me run for president because i've
[51:41] been pastoring
[51:42] that's a disgrace you're asking me to
[51:46] run for president well brother dale you
[51:48] can get things strained out
[51:49] no we know better than that in office
[51:51] ever no george washington never office
[51:53] we don't heard the prophet
[51:55] right so there wouldn't be no need of it
[51:58] my point is one thing
[52:00] it would be a disgrace for me to step
[52:02] down out of the pulpit
[52:03] to go past go and be president of the
[52:06] united states
[52:07] that's right i would not be fulfilling
[52:10] the bible that i'm trying my best to
[52:12] find and to walk therein
[52:16] you see then i can turn over here and
[52:18] say
[52:20] hey
[52:23] this is happening
[52:28] these things are happening
[52:31] we're seeing the earthquakes and we're
[52:33] seeing the the thing we're seeing the
[52:35] plagues we're seeing all of the things
[52:42] but are we seeing it in the order of
[52:44] understanding are we trying to keep it
[52:45] in
[52:46] or just not
[52:53] the prophet taught that the bride does
[52:55] not go through the tribulation
[52:59] but he thought there could be a
[53:00] pre-tribulation
[53:03] you don't hear that one used
[53:06] a pre-tribulation
[53:10] oh blessed god one of these days
[53:12] california's gonna slide under because
[53:14] it's going to be an earthquake
[53:15] which one
[53:22] you better not be here when that six
[53:24] seal earthquake takes place
[53:28] get out of here four to six seals
[53:31] six seal earthquakes gonna take
[53:33] california under but what about a
[53:35] pre-tribulation
[53:39] he said we'd be at the mercy of the
[53:40] elements and the different things
[53:43] but we're not going to be in the
[53:44] tribulation
[53:47] well that's tribulation that sounds like
[53:48] a tribulation to me no it's not
[53:50] because tribulation is a wrath of god
[53:55] just get that
[53:56] right in your mind what is tribulation
[53:59] wrath
[53:59] of god
[54:04] so you can see there can be a california
[54:05] earthquake i've tried to preach it 40
[54:07] years ago
[54:08] they could be a california earthquake
[54:14] then they could be another california
[54:15] earthquake
[54:17] there could be two of them taking place
[54:25] and that last earthquake is going to be
[54:26] when the sixth seal opens
[54:28] we better not be here when that seal
[54:31] breaks
[54:32] in the natural it's already broken and
[54:35] spiritual for us to understand
[54:37] we better not be here when it does in
[54:39] the natural we better start listening
[54:44] all right
[54:48] but do you get what i'm talking about
[54:51] god wanted a body so he
[54:55] created a human element body
[55:00] and we call his name jesus because
[55:03] that's the only name that god ever had
[55:05] is
[55:05] jesus all right
[55:09] and see then he went through what he was
[55:11] supposed to go through
[55:12] to pay the price to do all the things to
[55:15] make the sacrifice
[55:16] etc and then he left this world
[55:22] where's his body
[55:26] just a few days later here he come back
[55:30] right into his bride and made her
[55:34] his body we are his offspring
[55:39] we are his children he's got a body to
[55:43] live in now
[55:51] that's what it doesn't bother me i'm i'm
[55:53] human i'm i'm
[55:55] i know and i exist with all of us being
[55:57] humans but
[55:58] it doesn't bother me about all this of
[56:00] the viruses and stuff like that
[56:06] i'm a human being it does and that human
[56:08] being side
[56:09] but yet i know that he's gonna take care
[56:12] of me
[56:16] well that's why i didn't jump up down
[56:18] when all of them were saying that you
[56:20] know
[56:20] that if you had the viruses then you
[56:22] wouldn't have god you wouldn't a part of
[56:24] the body of christ
[56:25] show that to them in the word
[56:30] you realize what they were saying
[56:33] they were saying that the lord jesus
[56:34] christ had a virus
[56:36] because he was sick
[56:42] you don't listen to what people say and
[56:44] then analyze what they say
[56:49] jesus christ was sick then are you going
[56:52] to say that because of him being sick he
[56:54] was not of god
[56:56] um
[57:00] brother branham was sick
[57:04] stomach viruses all kinds of things
[57:08] all kind of situations
[57:11] but did it mean he wasn't of god no it
[57:13] was more the fact that he was of god
[57:18] he said well you've had the virus
[57:20] brother dale yeah i know what
[57:22] that's what they say i don't know
[57:24] nothing about it
[57:25] i stayed five days in the hospital for
[57:27] them to run me through
[57:28] they come in there one day and said
[57:30] going home i don't know what it was
[57:32] doing
[57:34] i didn't see nobody i didn't get no
[57:36] weather reports i didn't have nobody
[57:37] telling me what was going on
[57:39] the kids had called pig get called we
[57:41] was doing the best we could do to
[57:42] communicate but
[57:44] i wasn't worried
[57:50] because i believe god is real
[57:55] and if i am a child of god then i am the
[57:58] body that god is inhabiting
[58:01] do you think that way you need to
[58:08] i got notes here if you want them how
[58:11] jesus was the body of god
[58:13] that in body he was a man in spirit he
[58:16] was god
[58:21] how many you want us to read we've read
[58:23] them over and over to you
[58:24] jesus was the body of god
[58:31] how many do you want to read only 31 or
[58:34] 32.
[58:41] jesus was the flesh of god
[58:45] a tabernacle that god dwelt in here
[58:48] on the earth
[58:52] can you see one god you realize without
[58:56] that
[58:58] person now of jesus christ
[59:01] the human element your godhead is not
[59:04] complete
[59:07] because you only got a father in a holy
[59:09] spirit
[59:10] and that's what we had right come on
[59:14] i admit where i come from because that
[59:16] was the way i saw it
[59:18] the brother mode asked me what i saw i
[59:19] told him i said i saw god in three
[59:20] persons
[59:22] father's son holy ghost
[59:26] he said you're just as much as trinity
[59:27] as anybody else i said explain that he's
[59:29] a person of personality
[59:30] personality is an individual
[59:32] individual's a person i said okay i
[59:34] don't believe that no more
[59:36] it didn't take a whole lot for me to
[59:37] figure that out i knew i was wrong
[59:44] because all we was dealing with back
[59:46] there was a spirit and a soul or
[59:48] something like that
[59:49] or our fathers and and spirit
[59:54] but to understand one god you've got to
[59:56] have father son in the holy ghost
[1:00:01] see so that means
[1:00:04] when he left he was coming back
[1:00:10] as the holy spirit
[1:00:14] all right are you listening
[1:00:17] on the day of pentecost the holy spirit
[1:00:20] came back
[1:00:21] the spirit of almighty god
[1:00:26] not a second person not another thought
[1:00:28] or idea but the spirit of almighty god
[1:00:31] was coming back
[1:00:32] to live in a people
[1:00:37] that would make them the children of god
[1:00:41] god would have a body
[1:00:49] but you see that's why jesus can't come
[1:00:51] brother brown said he said
[1:00:53] said he when he comes back said it'd be
[1:00:54] the millennium
[1:00:57] because you think about it
[1:01:01] what if he come back right now
[1:01:04] and mess up every scripture in the bible
[1:01:06] because he'd be here in the body
[1:01:10] but he's already got a body
[1:01:13] we're his body
[1:01:19] see if he come right now there'd be two
[1:01:22] bodies
[1:01:22] that won't work
[1:01:28] he said well don't you expect no i'm
[1:01:30] expecting him to meet him in the air
[1:01:32] come on let's begin with the prophet he
[1:01:34] said he doesn't come to earth and set
[1:01:36] his foot on earth at that time
[1:01:37] he said we meet him in the air
[1:01:44] he can't come down now to a body because
[1:01:47] we are the body
[1:01:52] listen back there you had father you had
[1:01:56] the holy spirit
[1:02:00] now i'm trying to make an illustration
[1:02:02] out of this so don't run it off from the
[1:02:04] wrong end cause you're gonna
[1:02:05] bypass my whole point
[1:02:10] for the foundational world he was father
[1:02:16] right he was the spirit
[1:02:22] but he didn't have a 16-element body
[1:02:26] but he had a body a theophany
[1:02:30] a glorified condition existence whatever
[1:02:35] but see that was not his plan
[1:02:38] are you listening if you didn't get the
[1:02:41] whole point
[1:02:42] just listen i'm trying now i've read the
[1:02:44] book over to so far
[1:02:46] now i'm trying to just put the little
[1:02:47] pieces into it
[1:02:51] because you see when he came back on the
[1:02:55] day of pentecost
[1:02:58] it was not a flesh body coming to live
[1:03:00] in you and i
[1:03:03] so what did it take to make him complete
[1:03:11] it took a time that he would have a
[1:03:13] human body
[1:03:16] did he dwell on earth in a flesh
[1:03:20] 16 elements that would make his plan
[1:03:23] complete
[1:03:24] read christ the mystery god revealed
[1:03:29] god had a plan and a purpose that he was
[1:03:33] going to achieve
[1:03:34] and that was to make himself manifest
[1:03:39] see so jesus was father son and holy
[1:03:42] ghost
[1:03:44] not a trinity not a twoness
[1:03:49] but a real truth one true and living god
[1:03:52] he then had a body
[1:03:56] that he could walk in
[1:04:00] so he fellowshipped with a group of
[1:04:01] people and stayed with him for
[1:04:05] his life 33 years
[1:04:10] but it still wasn't a finish because he
[1:04:13] knew that he was going to have to give
[1:04:15] up that life
[1:04:16] that was within him he knew that he was
[1:04:19] going to have to
[1:04:20] die right are you listening
[1:04:24] jesus knew he was going to die
[1:04:29] all right listen what i'm saying if he
[1:04:31] knew he was going to die
[1:04:33] what was he going to do
[1:04:36] because he was going to lose the body
[1:04:38] because the soul and the spirit and the
[1:04:40] being and
[1:04:41] all that of almighty god couldn't die
[1:04:47] right god can't die come on i'm with you
[1:04:53] because you're dividing them up
[1:04:57] but when he made that possible by living
[1:04:59] in that human element
[1:05:02] brother brown said it made the three a
[1:05:04] triunity
[1:05:06] not a trinity
[1:05:10] not three persons one person
[1:05:13] manifested in three manifestations
[1:05:16] one person manifested in many many forms
[1:05:25] don't you think it was probably getting
[1:05:26] pretty strong long about him last few
[1:05:28] days
[1:05:30] when he seen that even all that he had
[1:05:33] done seems to have been
[1:05:34] worth nothing because they were just
[1:05:37] running from him and
[1:05:39] he told peter he said peter you're going
[1:05:41] to deny me
[1:05:43] oh peter no i won't i'll be there i'll
[1:05:46] fight for you to the end
[1:05:47] he meant it physically it's for right
[1:05:49] there he'd a fault cause he done it he
[1:05:51] tried it
[1:05:53] quick as they come and tried to pick him
[1:05:54] up in the garden who happened what what
[1:05:56] did peter do
[1:05:57] grabbed a sword whacked off a guy's ear
[1:05:59] he was fighting
[1:06:02] because it hadn't dawned on him what was
[1:06:04] taking place
[1:06:06] but when jesus said give me that sword
[1:06:08] if you take the sword you'll die by the
[1:06:10] sword
[1:06:16] then peter began to realize this man
[1:06:20] is going to die
[1:06:25] but he didn't know the story of how what
[1:06:27] it was made to work that that would be
[1:06:28] the only way he could ever get salvation
[1:06:32] he had the anointing
[1:06:36] he had the anointing of the spirit he
[1:06:38] had the gifts he had the things
[1:06:40] right but he began to realize
[1:06:43] something's going to take place
[1:06:46] because this man is talking about dying
[1:06:49] and now i realize it's physical
[1:06:55] because why didn't he grab a sword and
[1:06:57] start slinging
[1:07:00] peter began to realize
[1:07:05] he also seen his master
[1:07:08] say leave it alone
[1:07:12] this is all the plan of god to be made
[1:07:15] manifest
[1:07:18] i've got to go to calvary
[1:07:21] i've got to give my life because that's
[1:07:24] the only way
[1:07:26] you can get eternal life peter
[1:07:32] but it's also the only way that i'll
[1:07:34] have a body
[1:07:36] because i'm gonna have to give up this
[1:07:37] one
[1:07:40] i'm gonna have to exit this body well
[1:07:42] that's literally all he done
[1:07:44] jesus never died you on a quote from the
[1:07:46] prophet jesus didn't die
[1:07:48] and he ain't talking about the father
[1:07:50] son or any i mean
[1:07:51] he's talking about jesus never died he
[1:07:54] gave up his life
[1:07:56] he exited the body himself he went out
[1:07:58] he didn't
[1:08:02] he died himself he gave his own life
[1:08:08] because he knew the story that that was
[1:08:10] the only way to bring to
[1:08:12] the finality of what he come to do
[1:08:17] and that he was going to have a body
[1:08:21] what if he had a little time that he'd
[1:08:23] been able to sit down with peter and the
[1:08:25] 12 and
[1:08:26] you know and all of them and and start
[1:08:28] explaining what was taking place
[1:08:31] but he couldn't do it all done finished
[1:08:35] he had tried to explain it throughout
[1:08:36] his life and in the ministry
[1:08:38] and thing but he couldn't do it
[1:08:41] but jesus was simply saying i'm doing
[1:08:43] this to bring forth the body
[1:08:46] i'm going away but i'm coming back
[1:08:50] well he was expecting him physically to
[1:08:52] come back
[1:08:55] right but he wasn't talking about
[1:08:57] physically coming back
[1:09:00] he was talking about coming back in
[1:09:02] spirit form
[1:09:03] to dwelling them to make them his
[1:09:06] offspring
[1:09:08] to give eternal life
[1:09:11] see a body
[1:09:15] you realize on the day of pentecost it
[1:09:16] provided him a body
[1:09:20] how many do you want on these
[1:09:25] notice now he is the head of the body
[1:09:30] that's born from the sin of unbelief
[1:09:36] which is he is the head of the church
[1:09:40] which is his body and he wants
[1:09:44] the preeminence listen now
[1:09:47] listen close while we're
[1:09:51] what he is to be the head of the body
[1:09:55] his bride's body which is taken
[1:09:58] from him flesh and blood
[1:10:02] like in adam how much were you on
[1:10:09] as the head was struck from the
[1:10:12] took from the grave so must the body
[1:10:15] follow him
[1:10:17] where the head goes truly the body's
[1:10:18] going the bridegroom
[1:10:20] the bride being the body
[1:10:24] of the bridegroom
[1:10:31] some of you have these you got all of
[1:10:33] them and the rest of them if you want
[1:10:34] them i'll be glad to run you some
[1:10:36] because i'll run a good mini for this
[1:10:38] afternoon because i want to get into
[1:10:39] something else
[1:10:42] so you see if we don't get this right
[1:10:45] about the body of christ
[1:10:46] and the doings and the salvation and the
[1:10:49] point
[1:10:49] then how in the world can you talk about
[1:10:51] a bride being the fullness of the
[1:10:52] godhead bodily
[1:10:57] brother branham said she was
[1:11:01] well i can't believe it well then okay
[1:11:04] if you can't believe it then you won't
[1:11:06] be a part of it
[1:11:08] oh you'll be a luther you'll be a wesley
[1:11:10] you'll be a pentecostal
[1:11:12] but they couldn't do it they couldn't
[1:11:15] come forth
[1:11:17] it's the end time bride
[1:11:20] that will come forth
[1:11:26] so he had a body in jesus christ but he
[1:11:28] wants a body to live in
[1:11:31] the stature of a perfect man
[1:11:36] right the stature of a perfect man is
[1:11:39] the body of christ
[1:11:42] he's the head
[1:11:47] somebody's going to walk those steps
[1:11:50] until they can come into the
[1:11:52] position and god's going to come and
[1:11:55] take us out of this
[1:11:59] what are we going to be willing to do
[1:12:01] and to fight what has to be done
[1:12:03] or what are we going to do are we going
[1:12:06] to be scared to death when things start
[1:12:08] happening and they start closing down on
[1:12:10] us and
[1:12:10] whatever they decide to do and i ain't
[1:12:12] talking about tribulation
[1:12:13] that's what i'm talking about to you
[1:12:15] we've got a pre-tribulation
[1:12:19] the bride don't go through the
[1:12:21] tribulation but she goes through a
[1:12:22] pre-tribulation
[1:12:28] brother branham says
[1:12:33] israel will be getting their message
[1:12:42] while the church is getting
[1:12:48] persecution
[1:12:50] i ain't going to try to explain what
[1:12:51] he's saying i'm just saying what he said
[1:12:55] he said they'll take he said they'll get
[1:12:58] there while they're getting their
[1:12:59] message
[1:13:00] triple h is going to sit in over here
[1:13:03] and work its way to israel
[1:13:06] then the great tribulation strikes
[1:13:10] israel
[1:13:12] see that's why you can't understand that
[1:13:14] seven and three and a half
[1:13:18] people can't follow what the prophet is
[1:13:20] saying
[1:13:22] but they can't follow it with one thing
[1:13:24] we're not
[1:13:25] he's told us over and over we're not to
[1:13:26] be in the tribulation
[1:13:28] but he told us over and over we'd be at
[1:13:30] the mercy of the elements
[1:13:32] but see they don't look at a
[1:13:33] pre-tribulation
[1:13:40] you see as the bride begins to realize
[1:13:42] who she is and what's taking place
[1:13:44] then the body of god is being formed on
[1:13:46] earth
[1:13:50] getting ready you think he's going to
[1:13:53] run off and leave us
[1:13:55] when he spent all of this time trying to
[1:13:57] get us to come to that place home
[1:13:58] musician
[1:13:59] where he can come to a place that they
[1:14:01] can that he can manifest himself in us
[1:14:05] i hope you're listening
[1:14:08] i've got the notes for whatever you want
[1:14:10] to read them of all the prophet told
[1:14:12] about how that jesus
[1:14:14] was the body of almighty god
[1:14:18] that don't make a trinitarian point
[1:14:21] that makes the one true and living god
[1:14:23] to be in reality
[1:14:26] that jesus was almighty god
[1:14:31] all god was he poured into christ
[1:14:37] but see then we fail to follow the other
[1:14:39] of all crisis poured into the church
[1:14:47] until we realize that things has taken
[1:14:49] place
[1:14:50] it ought to be setting our hearts on
[1:14:54] fire
[1:14:56] getting ready to get out of here
[1:15:03] i don't i don't want to stay in this
[1:15:05] whole world i don't know about you
[1:15:07] i mean man i'm 80 years old but that
[1:15:09] still ain't here
[1:15:11] i've enjoyed my life i've had a
[1:15:12] wonderful life
[1:15:17] that i could live for god
[1:15:20] but i want to get out of here
[1:15:25] i want to leave
[1:15:28] what about you let's stand together
[1:15:31] think on these things we'll get back to
[1:15:32] it this afternoon on the godhead
[1:15:36] the bride will wind up being the godhead
[1:15:38] bodily or there's not going to be a
[1:15:40] taking her out of here
