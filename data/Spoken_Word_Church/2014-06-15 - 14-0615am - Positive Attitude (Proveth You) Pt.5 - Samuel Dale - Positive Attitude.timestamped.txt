[6:57] and i think it was 14 of us or something
[6:59] like that it was down this year because

[7:03] time and we found out a lot of things we
[7:06] didn't know so sister esther

[7:13] where she at she's back there okay don't
[7:16] let him fool you anymore he can cook
[7:20] he came up there saying he didn't even
[7:22] know how to make his own bed
[7:24] and he left cooking eggs
[7:28] and cooking um
[7:31] hush puppies and doing a good job we
[7:33] fired boyd
[7:34] he has to go over to the to the cleaning
[7:37] camp or something you know and take over
[7:40] on that side because it was it was a
[7:42] great time
[7:43] we really did and while we're at it
[7:45] we'll go ahead i got a lot of things and
[7:47] then we'll start now
[7:49] we're going to have a meeting here the
[7:52] fourth of july weekend all right
[7:54] that will be the first saturday in july
[7:58] which will be our
[8:00] regular bible study
[8:02] doing all right so we're going to have
[8:05] saturday night
[8:07] and sunday all right i want to give you
[8:09] an opportunity and then we're not going
[8:11] to vote we're just going to leave it as
[8:13] a you can let me know
[8:16] but
[8:17] what we're going to do we're going to
[8:18] have a fish fry that weekend
[8:21] all right so i'm going to give you two
[8:23] options
[8:25] all right you think it over comment back
[8:27] on it
[8:28] option one saturday afternoon
[8:32] meet about two three o'clock two o'clock
[8:36] you know here at the church down the
[8:38] stairs we'll meet
[8:40] and we will be cooking the fish
[8:43] and we will have hot dogs and things you
[8:45] know
[8:46] extra in case you don't like fish
[8:48] but we'll do that on saturday afternoon
[8:51] and then have bible study at six o'clock
[8:56] all right so that way you can make your
[8:58] plans and any of you from away
[9:01] that want to stay we will make sure you
[9:03] have a place to stay with somebody you
[9:06] know for the saturday night all right
[9:10] that's the option one we're going to
[9:12] have saturday services and we're going
[9:15] to have sunday services all right so
[9:18] it's not you're not thinking about that
[9:20] the other way is we can have the
[9:22] saturday night service
[9:24] of the
[9:25] bible study
[9:26] of those who would like to come to the
[9:28] bible study
[9:29] and we will like we say always we will
[9:32] might try to make a way for you to
[9:34] spend the night or do something saturday
[9:36] night you don't have to go back home all
[9:38] right and then we will have sunday
[9:41] morning service
[9:43] and have
[9:44] a fish fry and about starting quick as
[9:47] we get through
[9:48] eating maybe about 1 30 two o'clock
[9:52] sunday afternoon having no evening
[9:55] service
[9:56] all right so you're gonna have to let me
[9:58] know
[9:59] kind of the way you want so you got it
[10:01] we're going to how the service is
[10:03] saturday we're going to how the service
[10:04] is sunday so it's not a doing that way
[10:07] but it'll be a decision of whether or
[10:09] not you want to do on saturday and how
[10:12] the fish fry or how the fish fry on
[10:14] sunday
[10:15] all right because if you do on sunday
[10:17] the only problem we have
[10:20] is we finish and then there's going to
[10:22] have to be a delay
[10:24] in the time because we got to cook the
[10:26] fish which is going to take an hour or
[10:28] so to getting everything to going okay
[10:31] let me know about which way you want to
[10:33] go
[10:34] all right
[10:35] and that'll that we'll determine on that
[10:38] and doing
[10:39] in that okay
[10:41] let's see we got that now the way
[10:44] uh
[10:45] i started to have friday saturday and
[10:47] sunday because july the 4th is actually
[10:49] on friday but we will just have it the
[10:52] saturday bible study

[11:07] he was
[11:08] had a lot of diarrhea
[11:10] and he's also
[11:11] passing some blood
[11:13] so remember that

[12:05] i think that's all of the announcements
[12:07] did i miss any
[12:08] if i did i'll catch back up in a little
[12:11] bit okay
[12:13] remember we're still on the positive
[12:15] attitude so
[12:16] deuteronomy 13 and exodus 20 let's pray
[12:20] heavenly father we thank you for your
[12:22] grace and your love unto us
[12:24] thank you for all things and we pray
[12:27] that you would come among us today in a
[12:29] mighty way and
[12:30] do as you've always said that you would
[12:33] send your word and heal us
[12:35] and deliver us from destruction remember
[12:37] these that are sick
[12:38] remember the different ones lord among
[12:40] us and just have your way with each and
[12:43] every one of us that we may all
[12:45] lord be what you want us to be
[12:48] forgive our sins
[12:50] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[12:53] and lord just blessing god each and
[12:55] every one of us as we read your word you
[12:58] come and speak to our hearts we love you
[13:00] and we thank you in jesus name
[13:03] all right deuteronomy
[13:06] 13. we were on this last week
[13:09] and uh
[13:12] but you know i thought well we need to
[13:14] continue on this part
[13:16] i'll get more to that in a little bit
[13:18] but we want to read from deuteronomy
[13:21] 13.
[13:22] now remember in like in deuteronomy 18
[13:26] you're covering that if a prophet come
[13:29] and the word always comes to the prophet
[13:31] you know and the things come to pass
[13:33] you're supposed to hear that prophet
[13:35] right
[13:36] but this is the scripture that a lot of
[13:37] people never
[13:39] hardly relate to
[13:41] is deuteronomy 13 1 through 3.
[13:44] all right if there arise among you a
[13:46] prophet or a dreamer of dreams and
[13:49] giveth thee a sign or a wonder now watch
[13:53] and the sign or the wonder come to pass
[13:57] whereof he spake unto thee saying
[13:59] let us go after other gods
[14:01] which thou has not known
[14:03] and let us serve them see that's if
[14:06] that's what he says to you let's go
[14:07] after this let's go after a two soul a
[14:09] seventh under virtue
[14:11] forgive me okay
[14:13] no after false doctrines all right
[14:16] that shall not hearken unto the words of
[14:19] that prophet
[14:20] or that dreamer of dreams for you the
[14:23] lord your god proveth you
[14:26] to know whether you love the lord your
[14:28] god with all your heart
[14:30] and with all your souls so now he's
[14:33] going to do that now we read in
[14:35] exodus
[14:38] uh
[14:39] 20 verse 20
[14:42] verse 20 of what you're getting there
[14:44] verse
[14:46] 19 this is moses and you know it
[14:48] when they come out and got egypt i mean
[14:50] the people out of egypt and are out at
[14:52] the in the whole mountains on fire
[14:55] and they said until moses speaks thou
[14:57] with us verse 19
[14:59] and we will hear but let not god speak
[15:01] with us lest we die
[15:03] and moses said unto the people fear not
[15:07] for god has come to prove you
[15:10] and that his fear may be before your
[15:12] faces
[15:13] that you sin
[15:15] not you may be seated
[15:17] the lord add his blessing
[15:19] to the reading of the word
[15:21] now
[15:25] i want to
[15:27] the brothers pull up something and i
[15:28] hope
[15:29] that it doesn't bother the sister that
[15:31] gave me the testimonies okay
[15:33] all right
[15:34] uh and on the
[15:36] thing you'll see some writings because
[15:39] i actually saw the sister standing up
[15:42] last sunday during the worship service
[15:46] from back there and i thought
[15:48] you know that's odd because
[15:50] i don't mean wrong but i just mean that
[15:52] a lot of times you don't see people
[15:54] just one person here standing up worse
[15:56] than god
[15:57] but she was standing up and i think
[15:58] sister gail was standing there
[16:00] with her
[16:01] last sunday but i want you to read the
[16:03] testimony that her sister gave and i
[16:06] wanted i wrote up the top of it that
[16:08] remember that
[16:10] when wade was preaching the other night
[16:11] that brother aldous shot his arm up and
[16:14] and it just started moving so i'm saying
[16:17] god is with us but look at the testimony
[16:19] now if you have trouble reading it
[16:23] you know we can make some copies
[16:27] she said brother dale there's
[16:29] here's a praise report
[16:31] last sunday june the 8th during the
[16:33] morning worship service and i wrote
[16:35] there i saw her stand up see i saw it
[16:39] i felt the presence of the holy spirit
[16:42] very strong
[16:44] i couldn't help myself i just stood up
[16:46] and praised the lord
[16:49] praised the lord
[16:50] in that instant he healed my right knee
[16:53] completely
[16:54] also
[16:55] through my body
[16:57] through through my whole body i felt a
[17:00] power surge
[17:02] and a renewed feeling remains
[17:04] i had been taking three to nine
[17:07] ibuprofens every day for over a year
[17:10] just to keep going
[17:12] and to walk
[17:13] since last sunday i haven't felt any
[17:16] pain
[17:17] and definitely i have not take not
[17:20] needed any medication
[17:23] or pain pills
[17:25] praise to our lord and savior jesus
[17:27] christ sister charlotte marlowe
[17:30] i believe that don't you
[17:34] all right now what did brother brown say
[17:36] for god to touch one person
[17:38] so we got two accounts there
[17:41] he said that should encourage everybody
[17:44] to
[17:44] believe all right encourage you to
[17:48] believe
[17:49] and say well he can do it for one person
[17:50] he can do it for me
[17:53] and should be able to follow that line
[17:55] all right and if you want a copy of that
[17:58] but it will be on the internet part we
[18:00] can uh let him run it off it's all right
[18:02] with his sister to give the testimony
[18:06] all right
[18:08] now remember what we've been talking on
[18:11] the positive attitude
[18:14] and that's what i said about
[18:16] doings we talk about healing we talk
[18:18] about
[18:19] things happening
[18:20] and i believe that god as the prophet
[18:23] said wants to heal us
[18:26] more than we want to be healed
[18:28] you know when i first heard that i
[18:29] thought
[18:31] okay
[18:33] that don't sound like us old
[18:35] human beings
[18:36] that don't sound like
[18:38] you know i want to be healed
[18:41] i don't want to be sick
[18:43] and you say something to people and say
[18:45] what do you mean you think i want to be
[18:47] sick
[18:49] and i've said it and i still believe it
[18:51] and i'll keep on saying it i believe
[18:53] there's a lot of people in the world
[18:56] that i'd rather be sick than well
[19:00] i won't back off from that one step
[19:03] because i believe it
[19:04] you know why because you can never get
[19:06] them to a point to believe that they're
[19:07] healed
[19:10] you can't get them to a point to believe
[19:11] it
[19:12] and they ain't got nothing to talk about
[19:15] i got one in here i'm going to read it a
[19:17] little while when i get down to it what
[19:18] brother branham was saying he preached
[19:20] the message he went right down into
[19:22] discernment and irish people was doing
[19:24] exactly what he said
[19:26] he said they'd do it how many times have
[19:28] i told you
[19:30] we hear faith preach we talk about the
[19:33] word and then outside i got a doctor's
[19:36] point did we
[19:37] we are not worried about doctors we
[19:39] believe in doctors we go to doctors we
[19:42] thank god for doctors
[19:44] they are god's sent
[19:46] your prophet went to the doctor
[19:49] when grass valve is grass valley
[19:51] california when he was preaching jehovah
[19:53] jairus series he's having to go just
[19:54] about every day
[19:56] to the doctor and the sick being healed
[19:58] maybe dead raised and things we believe
[20:01] in doctors but we don't put the doctor
[20:03] first
[20:06] we put god first and we believe it and
[20:09] we thank god then for every help
[20:11] and aid that we can get
[20:13] in that line
[20:15] but see you can say
[20:18] you know it's hard to get people to just
[20:20] say
[20:21] i am healed
[20:24] what did it say
[20:26] well i don't want to lie about it and i
[20:28] ain't feeling better
[20:32] right i don't want to lie
[20:35] you liar anyway
[20:37] you're born a liar don't worry about
[20:39] being one
[20:41] you're born one
[20:43] when you say if you're sick and god has
[20:46] not healed you you're a liar because
[20:48] he's already done it
[20:50] right
[20:51] right
[20:52] but yet we were so super religious
[20:55] we don't want to lie
[20:58] if i said i was healed and me still
[21:00] hurting i'd be a liar
[21:04] okay
[21:05] so you're a liar
[21:08] but you don't understand my case
[21:11] i guess
[21:12] god's got different cases but
[21:16] brother brown said the same for
[21:17] everybody but anyhow
[21:21] do you understand what i'm getting at
[21:24] the prophet said the biggest portion of
[21:26] our faith is what
[21:28] mental faith
[21:31] all right
[21:32] he said hold on to your mental faith and
[21:34] confess it
[21:37] you remember when he was talking about
[21:39] how that that he started confessing he's
[21:41] healed and he was vomiting like crazy he
[21:44] was he said he'd hold his hand over his
[21:46] mouth
[21:47] and vomiting through his hand and saying
[21:49] i'm healed
[21:52] you remember what he told the blind man
[21:54] go say you're healed
[21:56] you know what he confessed it till god
[21:59] come on this thing and he healed him
[22:02] well
[22:04] well as he wounds he will his brother
[22:05] fourny said
[22:07] we're just so pitiful
[22:12] i would to god we would get out of being
[22:16] babies
[22:18] i'll read the first one we'll get to in
[22:20] a minute we've really been talking about
[22:22] i believe it's one where he talks about
[22:23] just being jellyfish christian
[22:28] jellyfish
[22:33] it ought to be the time that we get down
[22:35] and at least say what the word says
[22:41] they said something to brother brown
[22:42] said you told him people was healed he
[22:44] said the bible says they're healed
[22:52] right but think about it
[22:55] he said the right mental attitude
[22:58] toward any promise of god
[23:01] will bring that promise to pass
[23:06] now what's the right man latitude
[23:09] well i'm not gonna say i'm here cause
[23:10] i'm not you
[23:12] when i'm healed i'll get up until i'm
[23:14] healed don't worry about it you'll never
[23:16] say it
[23:20] because you must first you'll never be
[23:22] saved that way remember
[23:24] your first what
[23:26] confess with your mouth
[23:27] believe in your heart
[23:30] right
[23:32] the confession goes with it
[23:34] you know all right
[23:38] but then remember what we got down to
[23:39] into life's message
[23:43] you know that god loves to test our
[23:45] faith
[23:48] you remember that god loves to test our
[23:51] faith
[23:52] well what kind of a god have you got
[23:54] you sound like you've got a god that
[23:56] allows sickness as well we'll read it
[24:00] if he don't allow it it don't come
[24:06] but we're going to get it in the right
[24:07] place
[24:10] you know god loves to test your this was
[24:12] what i was trying to get across last
[24:14] weekend
[24:15] he loves to test you mental faith right
[24:18] that's right
[24:20] you know mental faith just just saying
[24:22] by strike some heal or believing it just
[24:24] start now he loves to test that
[24:27] why
[24:29] because he wants to know whether or not
[24:31] you're going to believe his word
[24:33] that's right right
[24:37] well i just can't understand
[24:40] that's what it means that's why people
[24:41] are not healed
[24:43] they can't even stand the mental test
[24:48] and i know my language forgive me out
[24:50] there
[24:51] when i say mental
[24:53] i mean m-e-n-t-a-l i know a lot of
[24:56] people say i'm hard to understand well
[24:59] all right get your dicks in here and
[25:00] look it up
[25:01] you know you'll find the word
[25:03] all right
[25:05] he loves to test
[25:07] your mental faith
[25:13] god loves to put you to a test
[25:16] what did he say about job
[25:19] devil comes up talking to
[25:21] god
[25:24] and he said have you considered my
[25:26] servant job
[25:29] you know what god's proud of him
[25:32] you know what he's proud to put him to a
[25:34] test
[25:35] you know what
[25:37] he lost what seven kids
[25:40] and even his wife turned against him
[25:45] boys all over him
[25:47] you ever had one
[25:50] you ever had a rising as we call them
[25:52] today
[25:56] you don't want them all over you
[26:00] you don't want one
[26:02] a little pimple on your face that you
[26:04] pop that comes out you know that ain't
[26:06] horizon
[26:07] verizon has got a core that goes down
[26:11] deep
[26:12] i had two on my arm one time
[26:15] about
[26:16] probably between an inch and a half to
[26:19] two inches apart
[26:22] and when i pulled that core out
[26:24] there was a tunnel away between both of
[26:27] them
[26:29] i'm talking about a
[26:31] core big enough to
[26:33] be bigger than a pencil i mean bigger
[26:35] than a a big large match stem
[26:40] job had them all over him
[26:46] and god says
[26:48] go at him satan but you can't take his
[26:50] life
[26:56] and then we get all upset because of
[26:58] some little bad cold we got
[27:04] we'll get to the point in a minute
[27:06] but he loves to test just our faith of
[27:09] what we say
[27:15] he loves to really loves to test us then
[27:18] after we get the faith
[27:23] he loves to test us after we really get
[27:26] the revelation
[27:30] you know after he's revealed to us
[27:32] what's going to be
[27:40] just think about it i wish that you
[27:42] would listen or read
[27:44] the message called perfect faith
[27:48] i wish you would get that one read it or
[27:50] listen to it
[27:52] all right
[27:53] god loves to try us
[27:56] and we'll allow things to come among us
[27:59] to trust
[28:02] that's right
[28:03] we'll get to it in a minute where
[28:04] nothing can't happen to you that unless
[28:06] god permits it
[28:10] enjoy he talks about
[28:12] 225
[28:14] the
[28:15] locust caterpillar he said my great army
[28:18] he even called you
[28:21] that i've allowed to come among you
[28:24] he says thou sent
[28:26] now we know he didn't
[28:28] make it come
[28:31] and we know that that
[28:33] that
[28:34] kangaroo bomb we're looking caterpillar
[28:36] is not god's army
[28:38] of great good things
[28:41] but it's what he permits
[28:45] he allows it to come among you
[28:48] all right
[28:51] in first peter 4 and 12.
[28:56] he said beloved think it not strange
[28:59] concerning
[29:01] the fiery trial
[29:02] which is to try you what
[29:07] as though some strange thing happened
[29:13] to you
[29:19] read it again
[29:20] beloved
[29:22] think it not strange concerning the
[29:24] fiery trial
[29:26] which is to try you
[29:29] don't feel stress make it strong you
[29:31] know well i'm going to only want to stay
[29:33] with you i'm the only one's ever had
[29:35] this case
[29:42] watch
[29:44] and say as though some strange thing
[29:47] happened
[29:50] to us
[29:56] things are not strange in god
[30:00] i thought we believed it was for a
[30:01] reason
[30:07] nothing can happen
[30:10] to you
[30:11] unless god allows it to come upon you
[30:18] now
[30:20] come on forgive me for being just blunt
[30:22] the way that i talk but
[30:24] you know we blame the devil for
[30:25] everything
[30:29] like that lady said he is a good devil
[30:32] but
[30:36] what if the problem you're in is a test
[30:38] or a trial
[30:42] and when we get through here i hope you
[30:44] realize that
[30:46] there cannot be
[30:49] a problem come upon you that god does
[30:52] not allow
[30:58] but ron said the devil is the best thing
[31:00] you ever had outside of salvation
[31:04] maybe a good wife and salvation
[31:09] he keeps you on your knees praying right
[31:15] i'm just sorry for the old boy
[31:17] because he can't be saved
[31:21] but whether you like it or not he's my
[31:23] buddy
[31:28] whether you like it or not he's yours
[31:29] too or would it be
[31:34] because
[31:36] he will make us come to the place
[31:40] that we're supposed to be
[31:45] well i don't like the devil there you
[31:47] want i hate him oh yeah
[31:51] most time you don't even know who he is
[31:53] you you called him around and said call
[31:55] him jesus jesus and worship the devil
[31:57] now that was his words
[32:01] a lot of times we think that it's
[32:04] god that's doing things when it's the
[32:05] devil
[32:08] or we think it's the devil doing things
[32:09] when it's god doing the things
[32:13] come on church wake up and let's at
[32:15] least we ought to be able to realize a
[32:16] little bit
[32:18] and see the day in the hour that we're
[32:19] living we talk about coming to a change
[32:21] of the body
[32:23] the prophet said we can't even have
[32:24] faith for divine healing hardly
[32:30] well i think it's about time to quit
[32:32] playing games
[32:34] i preached this 40 years ago why not
[32:36] keep preaching it now
[32:42] anytime a trial or a test comes we're to
[32:44] say
[32:45] thank you lord
[32:49] now what's
[32:52] to come out of this
[32:55] what do you mean you think the lord when
[32:57] you're sick
[33:00] oh you're poor
[33:06] your brother monk used to say and the
[33:08] guy said he then
[33:10] told him one time he's sick for the
[33:11] glory of the lord
[33:14] and then one time somebody said somebody
[33:15] got a leg off for the glory of the lord
[33:17] he said we'll cut the other one off give
[33:19] him double glory
[33:21] no we're not stupid or silly
[33:26] i don't go pray for a test to come i
[33:29] just know they're going to come
[33:32] right
[33:32] you don't have to figure them out
[33:34] they're going to come
[33:36] if you ain't been tested you're going to
[33:38] be why because the bible said
[33:41] every son that cometh
[33:44] must be what
[33:47] chastened
[33:51] it's for our benefit
[33:54] you know and i don't understand how come
[33:55] things are going wrong
[34:00] and we think everything's supposed to go
[34:02] right because we're a christian
[34:04] the prophet said
[34:06] you confess you're born again he said
[34:09] the devil turns every gun he's got on
[34:11] you
[34:14] go back in the bible and study some of
[34:16] those the lord jesus
[34:19] do it
[34:21] and we know he was right
[34:24] what about the apostle paul
[34:27] we know he was right
[34:28] what about all the others
[34:32] what about all down to the ages of the
[34:34] fox book of martyrs
[34:36] were on their own records the catholic
[34:38] church admit to killing 68 million
[34:42] christians
[34:46] burned at your stake done everything in
[34:48] the book
[34:54] and like
[34:56] the bible was talking about wednesday
[34:57] night until even
[34:59] the people the soldiers that was
[35:01] carrying them and doing these things to
[35:03] them a lot of times just got converted
[35:06] and walked right in with them
[35:07] right into the lion's den
[35:14] you know evidently if they got converted
[35:17] when they was going towards the lines
[35:18] then i guess you know let's go we're
[35:20] going home
[35:21] ain't no god i don't they better god
[35:23] he'd be helping us
[35:26] i wouldn't follow him would you
[35:30] but it would change around a little bit
[35:32] when i seen somebody and he was saying
[35:34] praise the lord i'm going to die today
[35:38] i'm going there that line's going to eat
[35:40] me up for the glory of the lord
[35:44] i'd rather be here than anywhere
[35:47] i must think about following him
[35:51] but no no we want to cry pity parties
[35:55] wealthy wealthy wu
[35:59] nobody ain't as bad as i am
[36:05] if you don't believe these people worse
[36:06] than you go sit in the doctor's office
[36:08] for a little while
[36:15] you want to go with me once every six
[36:17] months you know where i go
[36:19] do a cancer specialist cause they want
[36:21] me to go because they keep telling me i
[36:23] got leukemia
[36:28] you want to go in there and look at
[36:29] those poor old people
[36:32] and i just cry
[36:35] women sitting there no higher where the
[36:36] chemo
[36:38] burn them up and
[36:43] and then we get a bad cold i don't know
[36:46] what's wrong
[36:52] he said brother dale you shouldn't be
[36:53] that you're just preaching some good
[36:55] things
[36:56] i thought that was good to tell the
[36:58] truth
[37:00] you know
[37:02] listen to what your prophet had to say
[37:05] that's like i like to say it that way
[37:07] i believe what he says but i like to say
[37:10] your prophet
[37:11] you know you claiming to be a prophet
[37:13] go ahead brother let's look at this one
[37:18] waters of separation
[37:20] he's 1955
[37:23] e15
[37:25] he said i used to often time wonder
[37:28] what's the matter
[37:29] with the christian church
[37:31] they're so scared of things
[37:37] huh
[37:39] ain't nobody get cancer
[37:41] i'm dying
[37:45] right
[37:48] you tell you got a bad cold
[37:50] and you don't panic
[37:55] but they tell you you got cancer
[37:58] there's probably more people dying every
[38:00] day with a bad cold to do with cancer
[38:05] come on
[38:07] they're so scared of things
[38:10] well you got nothing to be scared about
[38:14] the first word nearly jesus said after
[38:16] the
[38:16] resurrection fear not
[38:19] don't fear don't get scared
[38:22] there ain't nothing going to happen
[38:24] nothing can happen
[38:26] nothing can bother a christian amen
[38:30] not even death itself
[38:33] can even touch the christian
[38:38] think about it
[38:41] he didn't hear my words and believeth on
[38:43] him that sent me
[38:44] hath everlasting life
[38:46] and shall not come into condemnation but
[38:49] it's passed from death to life amen
[38:53] death itself has no reign over a
[38:55] christian
[38:57] you know the prophet one time said death
[38:59] is my
[39:03] he he's my heifer i've got to that quote
[39:06] he carries me into the presence of god
[39:14] remember who was it the brother laying
[39:17] there and they come in and started
[39:18] singing the real sloth songs you know oh
[39:22] you know
[39:24] jesus
[39:26] keep me
[39:28] he said who's dying here you or me
[39:31] sing me some peppy songs
[39:40] death itself has no reign over a
[39:41] christian
[39:42] christ died in our state
[39:44] amen what a marvelous what what a faith
[39:47] that ought to be built up in the people
[39:50] come on
[39:52] something that'll total mark
[39:56] you'll never get nothing by being a
[39:58] jellyfish little jellyfish christian no
[40:01] sir did you ever see a jellyfish you
[40:03] just hit him he splattered all over
[40:05] everything
[40:06] really don't help you talk about a
[40:07] jellyfish and what it's doing said
[40:09] brother we need some christians not
[40:11] jellyfish
[40:13] but with a backbone
[40:15] that's right that'll stand
[40:17] oh i don't mean to fuss with people
[40:20] but stand for your god
[40:22] given rights that christ died for
[40:27] certainly
[40:28] not pushed around
[40:30] we don't have to be no sir
[40:32] we got we got an inheritance amen and
[40:35] our inheritance belongs to us it's your
[40:38] privilege to have
[40:40] anything that you inherited
[40:42] through accepting jesus christ and dying
[40:45] to yourself how marvelous yes sir satan
[40:48] says well i'll tell you what i'm going
[40:50] to do no you ain't going to do nothing
[40:53] that's the way to talk back to him
[40:56] say i know my position in christ
[40:59] and you just might as well get away
[41:02] ain't listening to you no more
[41:04] i got an inheritance
[41:11] but what do we do
[41:16] see we we want somebody
[41:18] to pet us
[41:22] right
[41:26] you remember right around and when they
[41:28] said something about that
[41:29] they said enjoyed something and the guy
[41:32] said i don't want nobody bragging on me
[41:34] he said you lied and i didn't
[41:37] there's something close to that
[41:40] you know
[41:42] we all want to be petted
[41:49] the husband wants the wife
[41:51] to pet him
[41:53] the wife wants the husband to pet him
[41:56] wrap her
[42:02] just human beings you know
[42:07] you know you don't get up every day and
[42:08] tell your wife how ugly she is
[42:13] you did you wouldn't have a wife lawn
[42:22] right
[42:23] we love to be petted
[42:26] and that's part of the human being
[42:28] but when it comes to christianity
[42:33] we're supposed to have a backbone
[42:39] brother made this statement one time
[42:41] about the children of israel and moses
[42:43] and i'll paraphrase it but
[42:46] he said he tried them people through all
[42:49] he said because he wanted to know
[42:51] when he got to crossing over jordan
[42:54] that he'd held the right people
[42:59] well i thought he knowed all about it
[43:02] well
[43:03] maybe he just kind of cuts things off
[43:06] every once in a while
[43:07] and allows us to move along in life
[43:13] but not be a jellyfish
[43:18] maybe somebody with a backbone
[43:27] romans 8 28 says what and we know that
[43:31] all things
[43:33] work together for good to them
[43:36] that love god
[43:38] to them are who are they called
[43:40] according to his purpose
[43:42] well if we don't believe all things work
[43:44] together for good to them that are that
[43:46] love god maybe we don't love god
[43:49] oh
[43:51] well i didn't think it looked like that
[43:53] in writing
[43:54] well why don't you read it
[44:02] and we know that all things
[44:10] all right
[44:11] now we're going to get down to something
[44:13] later in the message on the
[44:18] wednesday here a couple of weeks from
[44:19] now
[44:21] on some things about
[44:23] faith
[44:28] and how that really faith is
[44:33] it's a revelation
[44:37] but have you ever had a revelation that
[44:38] all things work together for good
[44:43] come on i'm asking you seriously
[44:46] i quoted that to a sister one time and
[44:49] she let me know in a hurry that she
[44:51] didn't believe it
[44:53] she said i got a husband dead and a son
[44:55] that's sick how can everything be for
[44:58] the glory of the
[45:02] lord like the way brother hamptons one
[45:05] time because i remember him saying this
[45:07] and it really well with me
[45:12] and we know that all things work
[45:14] together for good to them that love god
[45:17] and to them
[45:18] who are the called
[45:23] according to his purpose
[45:28] if we don't believe that trials and
[45:30] troubles and heartaches
[45:32] is a part of the christian life
[45:35] we don't believe the word of god
[45:38] many are the afflictions of the
[45:40] righteous
[45:41] but the lord leadeth out of them all
[45:49] now you mean brother dale that those
[45:51] people that were fed to the lines and
[45:53] killed and taken and just cut babies out
[45:56] of their pregnant women's stomach and
[45:59] feed them to the dogs and let them just
[46:01] stand there and bleed to death and
[46:11] talk about a loving god
[46:15] you know what if they hadn't done that
[46:17] and went into the ground you and i
[46:18] wouldn't be here
[46:20] that's one thing we ought to think about
[46:23] we wouldn't be
[46:26] here you think we're going out of here
[46:29] on a flower bed of ease
[46:34] oh but god loves his bride i've heard
[46:37] that love so much till i always got sick
[46:39] of the word love
[46:42] god loves his people he's not going to
[46:43] let them be tested or tried
[46:46] now i want that in the message i want it
[46:48] in the bible
[46:51] i don't give a hoot about your opinion
[46:52] of mine neither one i want in the
[46:54] prophet's message or i want it in the
[46:55] bible
[46:57] yeah but he just loves me so much
[47:00] till it don't matter what i do he
[47:02] forgives me
[47:04] oh you ain't forgiven
[47:07] you got a problem
[47:08] mentally first off
[47:11] second off spiritually
[47:13] all right
[47:15] well look all things work together for
[47:18] good
[47:20] to them that love god
[47:26] i know i'm a funny person i know i'm i
[47:29] know i'm made that way i'm just sorry
[47:31] it's my nature it's my way
[47:34] i know that i life and cut up a lot
[47:38] i know that
[47:40] but i can't stand it when everybody's
[47:43] down at the mouth so much
[47:48] you
[47:50] know bible says laughter is a good
[47:53] medicine
[47:54] oh i got what a prophet said we're not
[47:56] supposed to cut up
[47:58] i've got one too you know what he said i
[48:00] used to think that
[48:04] you want that one
[48:10] see i love to take what he says here 62
[48:14] and go to 64 and see what he's saying
[48:20] could you take one and say all you want
[48:21] to
[48:25] but he said i even found out that jesus
[48:27] had a sense of humor
[48:33] evidently it was some kind of a comical
[48:34] joke among them that are called harry
[48:36] the fox
[48:37] then go tell that fox that was evidently
[48:39] had something to do with some comical
[48:41] joke
[48:44] but yet we're think see here's one side
[48:46] of oh we're supposed to be a long face
[48:50] and never be happy for nothing because
[48:53] i'm so spiritual
[48:59] you'd make a good monk go to the
[49:02] monastery in salaam
[49:05] but here's the other side half and glory
[49:07] let's try everything and and i get sick
[49:09] at this
[49:12] we were at a place one time and we had
[49:13] just cast a demon off of a lady i'm not
[49:16] kidding you
[49:18] she sat down and started playing the
[49:19] piano
[49:23] and then she started playing the piano
[49:25] this other sister that was so spiritual
[49:27] she started laughing and talking and
[49:30] above everybody
[49:31] doctor's joking and
[49:34] i wanted to tell her to shut up
[49:37] but you know what i would have done i
[49:38] would have hurt her feelings and 90 of
[49:40] the people in there because
[49:44] you see i can't stand it when you're
[49:46] talking about the lord and i know
[49:49] i'm number one
[49:52] you come and sit down and talk with me
[49:54] me and you'll talk about the lord
[49:57] if you want to talk about it
[49:59] but if you don't want to talk about it
[50:01] man you're going to talk about hunting
[50:02] fishing
[50:07] because i'm not going to override you
[50:09] and make you talk to me about the lord
[50:14] like danny we're sitting on a boat on
[50:17] fishing that's before he ever come to
[50:18] the lord he said now samus at any time
[50:20] you won't talk about the lord you just
[50:21] go ahead and talk about it
[50:27] well see i believe in the middle of the
[50:29] road
[50:32] the middle of the road somewhere
[50:37] they said brother branham said to keep
[50:38] you rolling up in the mountains
[50:40] i've talked to brothers it was our
[50:42] personally with him
[50:44] he said he'd keep you rolling telling
[50:46] jokes and life and then talking
[50:52] but you know when a man was serious
[50:54] don't you
[50:56] you know that
[50:59] but see we think we're so super
[51:01] duper christians until
[51:03] you know we're not supposed to have any
[51:05] troubles
[51:08] and what's the first question
[51:10] why is this on me
[51:15] why am i having this problem
[51:19] you know
[51:25] and
[51:27] i don't think i even assigned a number
[51:29] to it brother joe
[51:31] but it will be between six and seven
[51:36] if you can get it up there while we're
[51:37] reading it
[51:39] you know what it is is hebrews chapter 4
[51:42] 1957
[51:44] 901 the evening service
[51:48] certainly they got weary every time they
[51:49] get to a place
[51:51] when a showdown then what would they do
[51:55] they would fly loose and get weary
[51:59] and want to turn back
[52:02] and why did this happen to me
[52:08] look what he says
[52:10] strange thing this morning after
[52:12] preaching
[52:14] that just as hard as i could
[52:18] there was many came into the altar
[52:22] and questioned it
[52:24] why does this happen to me
[52:29] it just got to explaining and preaching
[52:32] the whole sermon on people saying why
[52:35] did this happen to me
[52:39] and they come up why did this happen to
[52:41] me
[52:43] it goes over the top of the people's
[52:45] head
[52:47] that's what he said
[52:52] yeah we think we're so super-duper we
[52:54] have so much faith
[52:56] we're going to find out one of these
[52:58] days faith is a simple matter
[53:02] that's our problem we're trying to make
[53:04] it work
[53:05] when faith does not need anything to
[53:06] work it needs somebody to believe it
[53:16] nothing can happen to you and i let's go
[53:18] back now to number three
[53:20] i'll get part of these this morning
[53:22] which is taken from a message called i
[53:24] know
[53:27] in jeffersonville preacher easter
[53:29] message
[53:31] paragraph 36
[53:33] it's those crucial hours that press us
[53:35] on to those sacred sands
[53:38] it was in the bible and remember no
[53:40] matter how great the distress is
[53:42] satan cannot take your life until god
[53:45] has finished with you
[53:48] there is nothing can happen to you
[53:51] unless god permits it
[53:56] there is no evil can come unless god
[53:58] permits it
[54:00] and as far
[54:01] is for your good
[54:03] he's working that
[54:11] nothing can happen unless god permits it
[54:18] now i've always tried to be sensible and
[54:20] be a human being to think about
[54:21] everything that's why i say we blame the
[54:23] devil for everything
[54:25] just because you've got a bad coal
[54:27] doesn't necessarily mean the devil's
[54:29] after you it just means we're in an
[54:31] environment where there's going to be
[54:32] bad colds
[54:34] there's going to be this and there's
[54:35] going to be that
[54:37] and when something comes more into the
[54:39] drastic realms
[54:42] you know
[54:43] job had a pretty good set of
[54:45] circumstances
[54:47] to lose seven kids and all of his crops
[54:51] and his camels and all of his sheep and
[54:54] whatever he had
[54:55] yes
[54:57] and he's sitting out there and he said
[54:59] his best friend brother around said a
[55:00] little puppy dog
[55:02] and he's scraping himself with a piece
[55:04] of pottery
[55:10] and his wife comes up and said why don't
[55:12] you curse god and die
[55:16] but all of his friends they
[55:18] right
[55:20] all of his friends instead of coming by
[55:23] and being sympathetic with him you know
[55:25] and
[55:26] even praying for him
[55:29] right
[55:30] what were they doing
[55:33] job you must be a secret sinner
[55:36] you've done something wrong
[55:39] now
[55:40] if you hadn't
[55:42] god wouldn't allow this to come on you
[55:49] god put this on you because you've done
[55:51] something wrong
[55:56] he said i've offered sacrifices
[56:00] i've done everything god told me to do
[56:04] he tells me anything else to do i'll get
[56:06] rid of that that's
[56:08] the way we'd say it right yes
[56:11] well yeah we have so much troubles
[56:15] you know that troubles make you a
[56:17] character
[56:18] i'm sorry to say that it makes most
[56:20] people in the wrong character but
[56:23] troubles makes a character development
[56:25] in you that
[56:30] be done for good or bad
[56:34] oh we want to blame it on mom and daddy
[56:36] right i ain't heard it from my daddy i
[56:38] walk like him i look like him back like
[56:40] me drunk my drink
[56:46] we always want to blame somebody else
[56:51] right
[56:52] you know if now what's the point if you
[56:55] want to blame somebody else for all of
[56:57] it then you can't give credit to god
[57:00] for him putting you through the test
[57:03] did you get that i just now caught that
[57:05] myself
[57:06] if you blame everybody else you cannot
[57:09] say
[57:10] god is testing me
[57:13] you say god was testing grandma
[57:18] you're acting like grandma
[57:22] but we all want to do that
[57:24] i just can't help but be this
[57:29] my daddy
[57:31] sorry to say he was
[57:33] old country boy that loved to get drunk
[57:38] and he drank up to about two years
[57:40] before he died
[57:45] but i don't have to be a drunk
[57:48] and you know what it evidently set a
[57:50] stage so i can say it now i'm not saying
[57:51] they didn't never drink i ain't never
[57:53] told nobody my kids didn't drink
[57:55] because i'm just going to be blunt they
[57:57] probably did they tried it
[58:01] i'm just honest my kids wouldn't do
[58:03] something like that
[58:04] boy
[58:06] you don't know about raising kids
[58:13] i've always told you my kids my
[58:15] grandkids my great-grandkids it's got a
[58:17] halo but it's held up with horns
[58:24] but how come none of us
[58:26] i don't know of any of my brothers now i
[58:28] told you i'm sure they probably drank i
[58:30] know none of my brothers
[58:33] and in my family until this day
[58:36] there's only maybe one or two
[58:39] that ever does any drinking to the
[58:41] extent of a volume you know getting
[58:43] drunk
[58:46] and out of a hundred and something of us
[58:49] counting or mower you know a family
[58:53] i don't know whether it put a
[58:55] point on them or what but
[59:01] i'm like everybody else i looked at
[59:03] liquor and different things never tasted
[59:05] it because i didn't care
[59:10] but you see most people won't be honest
[59:12] enough to say what i say
[59:15] you know the reason i didn't smoke when
[59:17] i was a kid
[59:19] couldn't afford it
[59:22] smoke rabbit tobacco grapevines coffee
[59:25] grounds
[59:28] fig leaves
[59:32] i don't mind being honest
[59:33] that's where you want to beat on the
[59:35] kids for doing things and you're the
[59:37] ones that done it before them and you
[59:39] had your day we had our bell-bottom
[59:41] pants and duck haircuts
[59:43] and yet you make fun of these with their
[59:45] pants falling off of them
[59:51] see you don't want to be honest
[59:54] because i couldn't afford to do a lot of
[59:56] things maybe you did
[59:58] maybe that was your downfall
[1:00:05] but you see i just didn't want to do it
[1:00:09] i decided smoking wouldn't work nothing
[1:00:12] i didn't have to be delivered of it when
[1:00:14] i come in this message i didn't have to
[1:00:15] quit drinking smoking gambling running
[1:00:17] around with women all them things i
[1:00:19] i just didn't do them when i was a
[1:00:21] sinner
[1:00:27] are you trying to make yourself
[1:00:28] something better
[1:00:33] i will say one thing i didn't do it
[1:00:37] and you did
[1:00:40] now argue the point
[1:00:45] yeah but you wouldn't raise up under my
[1:00:46] environment and you don't die when all
[1:00:48] the alcohol was there
[1:00:50] i've hauled boys to guilds for from
[1:00:51] guilds for
[1:00:53] the homer
[1:00:54] to get beer
[1:00:56] and bring it back
[1:00:58] and set it out of my vehicle and go over
[1:01:00] and walk over and sit down and they
[1:01:02] drank it
[1:01:06] i don't mind being truthful
[1:01:10] but you see i just didn't want to do it
[1:01:16] but listen folks
[1:01:17] we talk about
[1:01:21] god in his ways
[1:01:25] but do we think about god trying his
[1:01:28] children
[1:01:30] to see what we're going to do
[1:01:35] permitting things to happen
[1:01:37] to see what you're going to do i'm going
[1:01:38] to try to get to a point if i can right
[1:01:40] here in a minute okay
[1:01:43] he permits it there's no evil can come
[1:01:46] from god come unless god permits it
[1:01:49] do we believe that
[1:01:55] do we actually believe that
[1:01:58] right or is that just a quote
[1:02:02] i'm believing for your case but it's
[1:02:04] hard to me believe from mine
[1:02:06] well i got such a bad one
[1:02:11] yeah
[1:02:14] what about it
[1:02:18] look at the next one
[1:02:22] look at number four i believe it is
[1:02:25] yeah time tested memorial
[1:02:29] he's talking about the guy that built
[1:02:30] the bridge
[1:02:32] that they said would not be able to hold
[1:02:33] up over some
[1:02:35] body of water or some river or something
[1:02:38] he tested every bolt he done everything
[1:02:42] they said it won't hold
[1:02:45] that's what they're saying today
[1:02:47] it's your holy ghost religion you're
[1:02:48] talking about it won't be long
[1:02:52] let me stop right there and say this
[1:02:54] part
[1:02:58] you know sometimes we have this
[1:03:00] super-duper religious attitude about us
[1:03:02] and we're so up and old nothing is
[1:03:05] bothering us you know when we're really
[1:03:08] and then we just start deteriorating
[1:03:14] and then you know the women they quit
[1:03:15] cutting their higher quit fighting their
[1:03:16] fights then all at once you see a little
[1:03:18] makeup up here
[1:03:21] you see a little
[1:03:22] trimming of the hair up here you see a
[1:03:24] little something happen
[1:03:28] what listen
[1:03:30] if you don't know it i'll tell you
[1:03:34] because i was there
[1:03:37] right
[1:03:39] a sinner looking at you and seeing you
[1:03:42] and they see you put that little bit of
[1:03:45] makeup on
[1:03:47] they know you are
[1:03:49] no more than they are
[1:03:56] your testimony has gone out the window
[1:04:04] you're testifying we don't do this and
[1:04:06] we don't do that but then you do a
[1:04:08] little sip you know and take a little
[1:04:09] drink or something or you dress comes up
[1:04:12] a little bit you begin to show
[1:04:15] sorry i was raised in the world
[1:04:19] i know what a prostitute
[1:04:22] looked like
[1:04:28] and i know what they're doing
[1:04:30] to attract
[1:04:33] and then i see sisters
[1:04:36] doing the same thing
[1:04:38] but yet testifying i'm a christian i'm a
[1:04:40] believer
[1:04:42] like i told you one time i wish some of
[1:04:44] you wouldn't tell where you go to church
[1:04:50] because
[1:04:52] somebody's gonna ask you one day well
[1:04:54] what does your pastor believe about that
[1:05:01] you know maybe i'm all preaching got the
[1:05:02] medal in but that's all right i'm the
[1:05:04] one that gets paid the
[1:05:06] medal the only one in the building
[1:05:08] that's right
[1:05:11] all right
[1:05:12] but is it the truth
[1:05:16] what do you believe amen
[1:05:18] all right
[1:05:19] this holy
[1:05:20] ghost it won't last in other words it
[1:05:24] won't be long trill burned down
[1:05:27] but it don't burn down
[1:05:29] oh the fire only waters it now we should
[1:05:31] explain that one
[1:05:33] how can the fire water it
[1:05:40] if you take a jet airplane you begin to
[1:05:41] learn
[1:05:43] you know then a jet airplane they spray
[1:05:44] water in the cylinders
[1:05:48] ow right
[1:05:52] come on
[1:05:53] but it won't be long
[1:05:56] you'll go back to doing it
[1:05:58] but it only streams and it gets you a
[1:06:00] new hold
[1:06:02] every trial testing every time a wind
[1:06:04] hits a tree
[1:06:05] and shoves it back and forth
[1:06:08] and back and forth
[1:06:09] it only loosens the roots
[1:06:12] so it can go deeper
[1:06:14] and get a better hold
[1:06:16] every time sickness strikes you
[1:06:19] it's right you're home listen
[1:06:23] so has everybody got off the tree
[1:06:27] he said well what do you mean i mean
[1:06:28] just what i said the other
[1:06:30] day i know how the human mind works most
[1:06:34] of you are still thinking about the tree
[1:06:35] now that it winds well and how the small
[1:06:37] tree will lights it through a storm and
[1:06:40] you ain't listening
[1:06:46] now get off the tree
[1:06:49] every time sickness strikes your home
[1:06:51] every time that trial strikes your home
[1:06:54] every time the neighbors say something
[1:06:56] bad about you
[1:06:58] it's only shaking you loosen you up so
[1:07:01] you get down and get a better hold
[1:07:03] on the eternal rock of god's unmovable
[1:07:06] word
[1:07:08] that's how god does it
[1:07:10] he sends those trials and tests
[1:07:13] trials to test you to prove you
[1:07:16] to shake you up
[1:07:18] and to give you a new hope
[1:07:20] to prove you
[1:07:21] was that what we read in
[1:07:25] exodus to prove you
[1:07:30] but what do we do
[1:07:33] it loosens us up
[1:07:35] to give us a better hold
[1:07:40] now we're not dummies i hope not
[1:07:43] we're not to go around and say well i
[1:07:45] hope something comes on me where i can
[1:07:48] glorify the lord but being gone don't
[1:07:50] worry about it it's gonna come you don't
[1:07:52] have to go searching for it
[1:08:03] okay
[1:08:04] lord one of it done that's the first
[1:08:06] question we ought to ask
[1:08:08] right that ought to be done what have we
[1:08:09] done that's fine that's human that's
[1:08:12] terminology that's human
[1:08:14] but then we realize we're not doing
[1:08:16] anything
[1:08:18] and it's the test that god has put us
[1:08:20] through
[1:08:21] to prove us
[1:08:25] now if those people back in the dark
[1:08:27] ages was put through those tests to
[1:08:30] prove them
[1:08:31] what should we think about this day
[1:08:36] like brother who would it brother bob
[1:08:37] talking about wednesday night
[1:08:39] that the preacher even would say i'm not
[1:08:41] going to tell anybody where i what i
[1:08:44] believe
[1:08:45] because i don't want them coming after
[1:08:47] me
[1:08:48] you know
[1:08:50] you remember the lady right around
[1:08:52] talked about said
[1:08:55] i got the holy ghost last night but said
[1:08:57] don't tell nobody
[1:08:59] she didn't get it
[1:09:02] i don't give a hoot she didn't get it
[1:09:06] it's like a house on a fire on a windy
[1:09:08] day
[1:09:10] you mean you'd be scared to go in and
[1:09:11] tell your boss what you believe
[1:09:15] my boss knows why i believe he read my
[1:09:17] books cause it's in his office
[1:09:26] he wrote on my report he said religious
[1:09:28] person constantly quoting the bible
[1:09:33] in his office with spoken word books
[1:09:38] he read them
[1:09:43] well i don't want nobody to know it i
[1:09:44] believe brother brown was prophet
[1:09:46] don't worry about you don't believe it
[1:09:51] now i ain't got a sign out in front of
[1:09:52] my house because i get tickled onto both
[1:09:54] sides right i get tickled at people
[1:10:02] there are
[1:10:03] people in the pentecostals you know go
[1:10:05] put a sign up in front of their house
[1:10:09] the ten commandments is in this place
[1:10:13] and then you go there and say well what
[1:10:14] about the first one that says it's just
[1:10:16] one god
[1:10:19] right
[1:10:22] you see what i mean
[1:10:24] you don't have to put a sign on your
[1:10:25] back run down the road we believe
[1:10:26] brother ryan was a prophet
[1:10:28] natar says a man he knows i worked with
[1:10:30] him week after week brother dick addison
[1:10:32] and i never mentioned brother branham i
[1:10:34] talked about the bible
[1:10:38] then one day
[1:10:39] he said where'd you get this
[1:10:42] i said now we'll talk
[1:10:47] i think my testimony is my my witness of
[1:10:50] what i'm saying
[1:10:52] i don't scream and holler to try to make
[1:10:54] everybody say they're believing a
[1:10:56] prophet brother tom fox bush he was
[1:10:59] pretty strong and bad he just go in the
[1:11:01] cafe and he called the waiter

[1:11:11] him
[1:11:13] i'm just saying i don't do it that away
[1:11:15] but you know what the brother gary
[1:11:18] atkins
[1:11:19] will tell you
[1:11:20] that he was spotting him on
[1:11:22] weightlifting brother tom was and
[1:11:24] brother gary made a mistake
[1:11:27] you know a good church to go to
[1:11:31] what are you going to do when a man got
[1:11:32] about 250 300 pound up above your head
[1:11:35] and he's looking down at you and said
[1:11:37] would you like to have the address
[1:11:40] and you just keep slowing that thing
[1:11:41] down
[1:11:43] you know
[1:11:45] you're gonna want the address in a hurry
[1:11:46] and
[1:11:47] that was brother tom i loved him and i
[1:11:49] didn't have a problem i told him
[1:11:51] personally don't do that tom
[1:11:53] i don't don't do that i'm not making
[1:11:55] light of him
[1:11:57] it's just his ways but there's people
[1:11:59] sitting here that come from that
[1:12:02] and you know the man sitting right over
[1:12:03] there he'll tell you in a hurry
[1:12:06] and there's another one raise their hand
[1:12:07] and they're the boy they'll say
[1:12:10] he said like uh
[1:12:13] which one would it move up in
[1:12:17] nashville or knoxville one
[1:12:19] and one of your brothers danny danny
[1:12:22] danny dan
[1:12:24] dan okay
[1:12:25] uh he said
[1:12:28] tom will buy y'all the food you want to
[1:12:30] eat if you're sitting licensed to him
[1:12:31] talk about the word
[1:12:34] if you want a meal just go sit down talk
[1:12:36] to him
[1:12:37] well he would
[1:12:39] and that's all right
[1:12:42] but i just believe just being every day
[1:12:45] i don't go down to my neighbors and tell
[1:12:46] him all about brother branham i don't
[1:12:48] have to you know why i don't have to if
[1:12:50] boys will tell you
[1:12:52] you know what they'll tell you one of
[1:12:53] them did just recently not too long ago
[1:12:55] was talking he said i used to because
[1:12:58] their kids are about the same age of our
[1:13:00] kids you know the boys
[1:13:02] he said we used to lay in the house up
[1:13:04] there and play games and things said
[1:13:06] listen to that man on that tape
[1:13:11] they know what we believe
[1:13:13] why do you think i opened up on the
[1:13:15] internet
[1:13:16] you think i'm afraid of the law
[1:13:20] everybody knows what i believe
[1:13:22] amen but i'm not challenging the law
[1:13:26] i believe in it
[1:13:28] i'm just saying be what you are
[1:13:31] god loves to test you
[1:13:34] he let people turn against you let
[1:13:36] everything in the world happen
[1:13:39] to test you
[1:13:40] to try you
[1:13:42] all right now let's get this license
[1:13:44] real quick
[1:13:46] because we got to get something
[1:13:47] straightened out right here
[1:13:49] all right
[1:13:51] go ahead and pull up
[1:13:53] because remember now the quotes we give
[1:13:55] you
[1:13:56] god loves to test you
[1:14:01] all right now
[1:14:04] look what james says let no man say when
[1:14:06] he's tempted
[1:14:08] i am tempted of god
[1:14:12] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:14:16] neither attempteth he
[1:14:18] any man
[1:14:23] but every man is tempted when he's drawn
[1:14:25] away of his own lust and enticed
[1:14:28] now what's the difference between tests
[1:14:31] and temp webster gives it very very
[1:14:33] close
[1:14:34] webster will interrelate the word
[1:14:36] between test and temp and the word test
[1:14:38] is not in the bible
[1:14:40] you know so it's not a you know you
[1:14:42] can't look it up to try to find a
[1:14:44] uh definite point
[1:14:47] see god don't tempt you
[1:14:52] he tests you
[1:14:54] well i looked up dictionary all same
[1:14:56] word
[1:15:02] but what about it
[1:15:05] he don't tempt us
[1:15:07] but he tries us that's
[1:15:15] tempting is to
[1:15:17] provoke
[1:15:23] whereas
[1:15:25] test
[1:15:27] is a trial
[1:15:28] of your quality to prove
[1:15:35] so no man
[1:15:37] cannot be tempted with evil
[1:15:39] neither attempted he any man
[1:15:42] now brother dale what you're saying
[1:15:43] about all this sickness coming in the
[1:15:44] devil you're saying god's tempted no no
[1:15:46] god permits
[1:15:50] god don't tempt
[1:15:53] now there's a police officer sitting
[1:15:55] back here that can tell you the law
[1:15:58] uh
[1:16:00] you can't go down the road
[1:16:04] and and
[1:16:05] you know it's
[1:16:07] tempting
[1:16:08] for you to go lay down
[1:16:12] a handful of money
[1:16:16] and then they can't arrest you for
[1:16:18] stealing it
[1:16:21] he said yeah they can cause it
[1:16:22] laws is crazy now
[1:16:24] but
[1:16:25] if you pick that money up
[1:16:28] the law has to give you a time element
[1:16:32] to be able to figure out what you're
[1:16:33] going to do
[1:16:34] because you can go hunt for the people
[1:16:36] that
[1:16:37] it was
[1:16:39] you can't go out and a prostitute go to
[1:16:42] bed with a man and then
[1:16:44] say that they
[1:16:46] that he's
[1:16:47] propositioned them
[1:16:50] no because that's tempting
[1:16:54] so the law says you can't do that
[1:16:59] you're not supposed to to publicly put
[1:17:02] anything out there to tempt and then
[1:17:05] arrest
[1:17:08] even the law says that
[1:17:10] god does not
[1:17:13] make prostitutes to tempt men
[1:17:20] come on
[1:17:21] don't be going off on me
[1:17:24] he don't do that to tempt
[1:17:28] he permits it to come in to be
[1:17:34] test is to check out your quality
[1:17:39] you know
[1:17:42] god does test us
[1:17:44] but he don't tempt us
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:48] he said well okay we'll read what
[1:17:50] brother ryan said about where you won't
[1:17:51] listen to me
[1:17:52] go ahead brother pull up
[1:17:56] number
[1:17:56] six
[1:17:59] which is god in his own word preaching
[1:18:01] 57
[1:18:04] 3 23 3 44
[1:18:06] god doesn't tempt men
[1:18:08] but god tries men
[1:18:11] test them
[1:18:12] god cannot tempt you
[1:18:14] but god can test you and every son that
[1:18:16] comes to god must be tested or child
[1:18:18] trained before he can be a son
[1:18:21] and if we can't stand chastisement the
[1:18:23] bible said we become illegitimate
[1:18:25] children and not the children of god
[1:18:27] because a child of god is born of god
[1:18:29] and he will stand the test
[1:18:32] anywhere anytime
[1:18:34] or any condition that's right a child
[1:18:36] that's born of god
[1:18:38] he that's born of god does not commit
[1:18:40] sin
[1:18:43] god had confidence in joke
[1:18:47] there's a lot of difference in testing
[1:18:48] and tempting
[1:18:50] i'll stop with that
[1:18:54] tempting is deliberately
[1:18:57] laying out in front of you
[1:19:00] some form
[1:19:03] or doing something
[1:19:06] and it's illegal to do that and then
[1:19:08] arrest you immediately
[1:19:10] and call you a thief
[1:19:13] you've got to give an amount of time for
[1:19:15] the person to be able to
[1:19:17] return the money or do whatever or carry
[1:19:20] it to the police or you know
[1:19:23] what you call that word entrapment
[1:19:27] all right now entrapment is a common
[1:19:29] word among us that means they trapped
[1:19:31] you
[1:19:33] deliberately traps you
[1:19:38] and see god don't tempt nobody he don't
[1:19:40] make these things
[1:19:45] come up in front of you
[1:19:47] to tempt you
[1:19:50] he permits things to happen
[1:19:53] to test
[1:19:54] well i don't know the difference in the
[1:19:56] word well
[1:19:57] all right then
[1:19:59] the difference in the word is
[1:20:01] satan
[1:20:02] attempts
[1:20:08] god tests
[1:20:11] all right
[1:20:12] satan tempts you
[1:20:17] but god tests you
[1:20:20] a lot of difference in it
[1:20:24] don't say god is tempting me
[1:20:27] to do wrong
[1:20:29] because you're totally out of the word
[1:20:34] and he doesn't test you
[1:20:37] to try to
[1:20:39] you know
[1:20:40] put it in the wrong point
[1:20:43] he tests you to let you find out what
[1:20:44] you'll do
[1:20:50] worked at general motors and
[1:20:52] these are there brother colley brother
[1:20:54] al brother
[1:20:55] dick i know for sure tony probably
[1:20:57] remembers it
[1:20:59] uh
[1:21:00] at a man named bradbury right
[1:21:03] he cashed checks
[1:21:06] when he cashed a check and
[1:21:08] he would keep the change off of the
[1:21:10] check
[1:21:11] and he literally cashed it he literally
[1:21:13] had a drawer just like a bank would
[1:21:15] layer you know things in it he had
[1:21:18] hundreds fifties twenties tens fives and
[1:21:21] ones
[1:21:22] but he didn't deal with no change
[1:21:25] he made more money cashing checks in a
[1:21:28] week then he made it working at general
[1:21:30] motors
[1:21:35] and he's also loan money
[1:21:37] well you know what he'd do any loan
[1:21:39] money
[1:21:39] attempted
[1:21:41] he loaned you 20 bucks he paid him back
[1:21:43] 30 on friday and he automatically
[1:21:46] deducted that
[1:21:47] from you to cash your check he was very
[1:21:50] smart
[1:21:52] my point is one thing
[1:21:55] he carried within his billfold from ten
[1:21:57] to twenty thousand dollars because he
[1:22:00] loaned money all week long these
[1:22:02] brothers know the story
[1:22:04] on the fridays or what day we got to
[1:22:06] thank he would bring from 40 to thousand
[1:22:09] dollars
[1:22:11] in a brown paper bag
[1:22:16] because you're gonna cash all those
[1:22:17] checks
[1:22:18] guy tried to rob him one day he also
[1:22:20] carried a gun
[1:22:21] he got by with it all right
[1:22:25] but
[1:22:26] he was a trainer on our line that i
[1:22:28] worked on
[1:22:30] and uh
[1:22:31] he never did like me too well
[1:22:34] from personal reasons
[1:22:38] one day he came down through there
[1:22:39] working
[1:22:42] and he had that big old stack of money
[1:22:44] in that
[1:22:45] brown paper bag
[1:22:49] and he
[1:22:51] laid it on my desk because he had to get
[1:22:52] some tools out of his pocket cover all
[1:22:54] you know to work
[1:22:56] and he forgot it
[1:22:59] and he went on down the line working on
[1:23:01] that car
[1:23:03] about
[1:23:04] five ten minutes later
[1:23:07] he comes down the line boy he was
[1:23:09] worried
[1:23:11] because it was
[1:23:13] the money was dire cash money no way to
[1:23:15] say it was his
[1:23:17] or whatever
[1:23:19] he comes walking down the line and more
[1:23:21] he's looking everywhere i said bradbury
[1:23:24] he said yeah
[1:23:25] i said open that drawer right there
[1:23:30] i said your money's in there
[1:23:34] he changed his attitude about me for
[1:23:38] you know still didn't probably like me
[1:23:40] but he changed his attitude
[1:23:42] because i could have put that money in
[1:23:43] my pocket and kept it
[1:23:46] from 40 to 60 000
[1:23:48] it would have been no way he could prove
[1:23:50] anything
[1:23:52] and nobody would have seen it because
[1:23:54] nobody down the line knew where his
[1:23:55] money was he was asking
[1:23:58] i just took it when he walked off i took
[1:24:00] it stuck it in the drawer put some stuff
[1:24:02] over it
[1:24:05] my point is one thing
[1:24:09] god was testing me yes
[1:24:13] but he was not tempting me
[1:24:15] the devil allowed the man to put the
[1:24:17] point there
[1:24:18] to tempt me
[1:24:22] but i had no thoughts of keeping that
[1:24:24] money
[1:24:25] there was not even a thought not even a
[1:24:28] an inkling
[1:24:30] of keeping that money
[1:24:33] i would have fought you
[1:24:34] to kept his money
[1:24:39] because see i've always tried to believe
[1:24:40] in being a christian
[1:24:45] what would you do if you had an
[1:24:47] opportunity to pick up forty thousand
[1:24:49] sixty thousand dollars and walk off with
[1:24:51] it
[1:24:54] i don't mean a thing to me
[1:24:59] that means nothing to me
[1:25:05] i would just give it back to you
[1:25:09] well brother dale i have to admit
[1:25:12] i wouldn't do that well
[1:25:14] i have to admit there's something wrong
[1:25:16] with you
[1:25:19] is that blunt enough
[1:25:21] i have to admit there's something wrong
[1:25:22] with you now i didn't say there's
[1:25:24] something wrong with you if you thought
[1:25:26] about it
[1:25:27] because that's human
[1:25:33] i sold my home we did in 1973.
[1:25:39] sold it to my brother
[1:25:42] no so did my nephew
[1:25:46] my brother came up and offered me ten
[1:25:48] thousand dollars
[1:25:51] i had never signed no paperwork it was a
[1:25:53] verbal agreement between terry and
[1:25:55] myself
[1:25:57] he said i'll give you ten thousand
[1:25:59] dollars
[1:26:01] or a man did to my brother i said tell
[1:26:04] sam i give him ten thousand dollars
[1:26:05] above what terry offered him he said he
[1:26:08] ain't signed no dealings i know i said
[1:26:10] don't make no difference
[1:26:12] my word is my bond
[1:26:14] even my brother when he found out he
[1:26:16] said let him have it we'll divide the
[1:26:19] money you
[1:26:20] know
[1:26:22] i said no
[1:26:24] my word is my bond
[1:26:31] if we can't be that
[1:26:33] in human life
[1:26:35] let's don't even talk about all the
[1:26:37] other
[1:26:38] because you see sometimes god does test
[1:26:40] you
[1:26:41] to see what you're going to do
[1:26:48] well what does that guy do being a
[1:26:49] christian
[1:26:55] i'll let you talk about that in your own
[1:26:57] ways come on musicians let's
[1:27:03] my point is
[1:27:05] the world is looking at you and i
[1:27:11] and you know what at general motors
[1:27:13] you've heard me say it and these older
[1:27:15] brothers knows
[1:27:16] it i was oldest seniority hand on the
[1:27:20] labor pool
[1:27:22] which meant i could pick my job
[1:27:27] i could pick my job every day my
[1:27:29] supervisor you've heard me tell you
[1:27:31] about him
[1:27:34] he had to depend on me most of the time
[1:27:36] to be able to handle even what was doing
[1:27:38] because he didn't know what we were
[1:27:40] doing
[1:27:42] and people wouldn't even call him to try
[1:27:44] to straighten something out they call me
[1:27:46] they'd come and get me off the line and
[1:27:48] make me go do something to straighten up
[1:27:50] the thing
[1:27:56] but you know what
[1:27:58] every day i would look around and i'd
[1:28:00] see some of them guys and i'd say man he
[1:28:01] looks like he's tired
[1:28:03] you take that job
[1:28:06] sometimes we had jobs it was nothing
[1:28:08] more than just floating
[1:28:10] walking around
[1:28:11] moving nuts and bolts and
[1:28:13] maybe standing there putting washers on
[1:28:15] a boat you know
[1:28:16] sub-assembly they called it
[1:28:19] so you take that one
[1:28:22] i'll take this one
[1:28:24] which meant i was picking the strut up
[1:28:26] which was the whole shock assembly with
[1:28:28] your hoove on it
[1:28:30] which weighed 80 90 pounds
[1:28:34] and then having to hang them up on a
[1:28:35] hook
[1:28:36] and the hook got higher because they
[1:28:37] didn't stop
[1:28:42] point
[1:28:43] was what
[1:28:45] there ain't nobody that's ever worked
[1:28:46] with me said i didn't carry my load
[1:28:53] that i sat down
[1:28:55] didn't do nothing
[1:28:58] this weekend we were up there doing what
[1:28:59] to do
[1:29:01] i was up helping them do around the
[1:29:03] count when
[1:29:04] i had the right to sit back and say
[1:29:05] serve me boys i'm your pastor
[1:29:10] no i wasn't washing dishes
[1:29:12] moving things and doing things
[1:29:15] why because i believe
[1:29:18] in being
[1:29:20] a christian all the way through
[1:29:24] and i don't say god is tempting me with
[1:29:26] i know no but he's testing us
[1:29:31] satan tempts
[1:29:32] god tests
[1:29:35] he allows things to come our way to see
[1:29:38] what we'll do
[1:29:41] but you don't go out there and build it
[1:29:43] up and then bring it and set it in front
[1:29:45] of us
[1:29:48] he doesn't use entrapment
[1:29:50] he knows we're human beings and we're
[1:29:52] going to go through life
[1:29:54] and be tempted and tested
[1:29:59] but what are we going to do
[1:30:02] understand
[1:30:04] what's that
[1:30:05] spiral booth we're 88 in the spa anybody
[1:30:07] have a need
[1:30:28] uh
[1:30:37] is
[1:30:49] foreign
[1:31:22] everything will be all right
[1:31:30] anybody else is this happening
[1:31:54] we believe it
[1:31:56] we thank god
[1:31:57] that he's a healer and we believe he'll
[1:31:59] take care of you
[1:32:00] father in jesus name we send this to
[1:32:02] brother dean lord believe in your word
[1:32:04] that by your stripes he's healed
[1:32:07] in jesus name
[1:32:22] if we can't stand the trials and
[1:32:24] testings
[1:32:29] then evidently we're not the children of
[1:32:31] god
[1:32:50] is
