[9:54] a little bit of bring us a little bit of
[9:57] we were kidding the other day you know
[9:59] how some of the big name preachers they
[10:01] have an organist sitting over there you
[10:03] know when he makes a point they go
[10:04] aren't we the smart you never know
[10:09] especially second service when all the
[10:12] sleepers are here yeah mm-hmm I just
[10:17] will just connect it to your bench and
[10:20] turn it on right yeah uh-huh good to be
[10:23] in the house of Lord good disabled I got
[10:26] to get crowned today Lord bless you
[10:28] let's turn into revelations six and get
[10:31] started
[10:34] have a good week this week y'all have a
[10:36] good week this week have a good week
[10:39] this week we really
[10:43] Lord just opened my eyes on something
[10:45] yes sir this morning actually no just
[10:47] last night and then this morning a
[10:49] little bit too so you get to meditating
[10:52] on certain things and then it takes you
[10:54] to other things and maybe we'll get into
[10:58] that but I'm telling you that we're
[11:01] standing this fourth seal and I I really
[11:03] didn't want to get to part ten I wanted
[11:05] to kind of continue on but still being
[11:08] as important as it is I think we ought
[11:10] to stay there till we get it finished
[11:11] till we get it to where we can
[11:13] understand it today I want to in my own
[11:18] feeble way and I mean that literally
[11:21] brother Dale has explained this for
[11:23] years about the son of God son of man
[11:25] son of David and all that and I'm gonna
[11:27] try to maybe draw it out a little bit
[11:28] kind of like he did years ago and
[11:31] refresh our memory just a little bit and
[11:33] for the new ones that are that are here
[11:35] that didn't get to see that cuz that was
[11:37] man that was like 90 80 90 80s 90s you
[11:42] know 80 81 82 so some of you weren't
[11:46] even breathing at that point so maybe
[11:49] we'll get to try to hit the high points
[11:52] today cuz I was thinking this week this
[11:54] week and I thought well we'll get into
[11:57] the son of man will you really don't
[12:00] understand until and I know you do
[12:02] because when you you ever been talking
[12:05] to somebody and you really know that
[12:06] they don't getting it or that they have
[12:10] questions about it and you know even in
[12:13] conversation with people you so when
[12:15] you're up here preaching you know
[12:16] sometimes man it flows like honey on a
[12:20] warm day sometimes it flows like honey
[12:23] on a cold day
[12:24] same honey but one foal it flows a
[12:27] little faster than the other so when
[12:30] we're talking about the dispensations
[12:32] we're going to try to maybe today show
[12:35] how important it is that if we don't get
[12:38] the son of man revelation in this hour
[12:40] we have missed that coming we have
[12:44] missed the coming of William Marion
[12:46] Branham we have missed his coming and
[12:48] why he came to deliver this message
[12:50] until we see what the son of man is we
[12:55] missed it if we don't okay now I'm not
[12:58] saying you missed the right drum now am
[12:59] i saying you missed Christianity I'm
[13:01] just saying you're missed
[13:01] what our box is what was delivered to us
[13:06] so let's bow our heads and try to you
[13:09] pray for me and I'll pray for you do you
[13:11] have any father we pray Lord that you'd
[13:13] be with us today bless your people Lord
[13:16] sometimes we get tired and weary and
[13:19] worn our mind drifts off to different
[13:22] things but Lord just let us focus today
[13:23] on one one thing and that's you Lord not
[13:27] not words not so much as letters on a
[13:32] page but let it come alive in a heart
[13:34] let it be something that we take with us
[13:36] and we'll be able to as the two from
[13:39] Emmaus it just burning their heart when
[13:41] you open the scripture to him why
[13:42] because you were the word you were the
[13:44] word Lord and you were telling them
[13:46] about yourself but now we know Lord that
[13:49] that revelation is the same here you
[13:54] were God in human flesh talking to the
[13:56] tool at Emmaus but they did not
[13:58] understand because they didn't have the
[13:59] Holy Ghost but Lord now us with the Holy
[14:03] Ghost in our heart the very one that
[14:05] wrote the word Lord we should know in
[14:08] our own being we should know what this
[14:12] words all about because the one that
[14:15] wrote it is now inside of the believers
[14:17] and we need to yield ourselves to you
[14:20] Lord that we will understand more Father
[14:22] and that there's the days go on Lord
[14:25] that you'll get sweeter and sweeter and
[14:27] that the word will become more rich Lord
[14:30] and all the other things of life will be
[14:32] just shed away father forgive us of our
[14:35] sins and bless this Lord take care of us
[14:37] through this service be ones that are
[14:39] sick we were the ones that are traveling
[14:40] be with the missionaries on the foreign
[14:43] fields Lord give them fruit for their
[14:44] labor father just bless us in Jesus name
[14:46] we pray amen and when he had opened the
[14:51] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[14:52] fourth beast say come and see who's the
[14:54] fourth beast the eagle and I looked and
[14:56] behold a pale horse and his name that
[14:58] sat on him was death and hell followed
[14:59] with him
[15:00] and power was given unto them over the
[15:02] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[15:03] the sword and with hunger with death and
[15:05] with the beasts of the earth you may be
[15:07] seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[15:08] the reading of the
[15:09] now let's just kind of background for a
[15:11] few minutes and then we'll we'll try to
[15:14] go through this maybe a little bit
[15:19] quickly and two to maybe get it in our
[15:23] heart and life that that we are surely
[15:26] in a special time this is not just if
[15:29] this is just if this is just going to
[15:31] church and this is just another church
[15:33] age and efficient just another then it's
[15:36] just another it's just another time this
[15:38] but it's not it it's it's not it this is
[15:41] when when the son of man appears on the
[15:45] earth he's not going to appear in his
[15:46] flesh he's going to appear in your flesh
[15:51] so you are the walking Son of Man on the
[15:55] earth as a collective body not as one
[15:57] person we know that there's no one can
[16:00] take the place of one man son of man
[16:02] except Jesus Christ himself but what did
[16:05] he do he transferred that to me and you
[16:08] that you and I have come to an end time
[16:11] to where where God sent a prophet that
[16:13] was a conduit of God that when God spoke
[16:17] it come through his mouth and it wasn't
[16:21] just for him and it wasn't basically for
[16:26] the ones that were listening while he
[16:27] was alive swine says in the days of the
[16:30] boys because many times we see and I've
[16:32] read you many times before in the sixth
[16:34] seal brother Branham said it's gone from
[16:35] you and it's not even for you but go
[16:38] only the same a simple Christian life
[16:40] that's what he was telling the people
[16:41] because the revelation of the Son of God
[16:43] was never lost in the church ages the
[16:48] Holy Ghost was in every church age we'll
[16:50] look at just a second but the son of man
[16:52] revelation is what was lost in the
[16:53] church ages name him Jesus Christ became
[16:58] the chief Cornerstone why so that he
[17:01] could I was talking to the brothers and
[17:04] sisters downstairs you know why didn't
[17:06] God just like I said before why didn't
[17:09] God just walk out of the tomb and just
[17:10] say okay devil dead all your demons are
[17:12] dead and I'm all my children come to
[17:15] life that would have been really easy
[17:16] but there's a journey in there why did
[17:20] he come up to Abraham when he come to
[17:21] the earth
[17:22] when he was in the ER Chaldees and he
[17:23] said Abraham get up and take a walk go
[17:27] on a journey right and 25 years later
[17:31] that came to pass that he will still
[17:33] have a baby well now why didn't God just
[17:34] say okay Abraham tomorrow I'm gonna
[17:36] change your body I'm gonna change
[17:37] Sarah's body and when you gonna have a
[17:38] child and everything's gonna be done
[17:40] that wouldn't have been the journey of
[17:42] Abraham that wouldn't have been the
[17:44] journey of the Christian same way with
[17:46] you and I so we have a time in our life
[17:48] that this this journey your your journey
[17:51] means something because you know what
[17:52] God saw your journey before the
[17:54] foundation of the world he saw the
[17:56] choices you would make and he wrote the
[17:59] word according he wrote the word
[18:03] according to what you do because you got
[18:06] to look back in the Bible and see you
[18:07] write well if you can't see your journey
[18:10] in the Bible then you're not in there
[18:12] the Pharisees remember brother Brown
[18:14] said the Pharisees we're blacked out one
[18:16] sure their names in the Bible Pharisee
[18:19] sad you see but if they weren't born
[18:22] again their names are not in the Bible
[18:23] their name the name that they're they're
[18:26] identified with it's not in the
[18:27] scripture you and I have an
[18:29] identification you and I are the bride
[18:31] of Jesus Christ
[18:32] we're not Israel we're Gentiles and God
[18:39] come for a Gentile bride the man so you
[18:41] and I have come to a place that we have
[18:44] we have not just we have not just come
[18:49] to a place to where we look back and go
[18:51] wow that was that was good well that was
[18:53] good but that's not this this is fresh
[18:58] meat this is fresh revelation this is
[19:00] what the eagle eats now remember an
[19:02] eagle doesn't eat you watch an old
[19:05] Buzzard he'll eat something's been dead
[19:06] for what five six seven eight ten days
[19:08] he don't care
[19:09] behind eagle you don't see an eagle
[19:10] crowding around touching it no it's
[19:12] fresh kill so you and I have to come
[19:14] every Sunday every Wednesday every time
[19:16] we pray and read our Bible and open the
[19:18] books we have to have fresh meat it has
[19:21] to be something fresh for us to eat to
[19:23] be to be that was the problem with
[19:26] Pentecost that was the problem with all
[19:28] them he said they what those uncle three
[19:29] unclean spirits like frogs what they
[19:31] look back and you know it was great when
[19:35] brother Brown was
[19:35] it was great when the meetings happen
[19:37] but like brother Dale said if we don't
[19:38] move off that if we don't move off that
[19:41] it was just all signs and wonders and it
[19:43] was all the discernment then we missed
[19:47] the message we've missed the message but
[19:50] remember with a message there's always a
[19:52] sign always there's always a sign with a
[19:56] message but what's more important I
[19:58] thought signs followed the believer not
[20:02] the believers following signs that was
[20:04] the problem with the Pentecost they got
[20:06] all flesh feeling good and they went off
[20:08] with the signs and left the message and
[20:11] the messenger they left brother Branham
[20:15] and they went for the signs you know
[20:16] they didn't know they didn't they didn't
[20:18] hear the message that was behind it
[20:20] so you and I have the message that's
[20:22] behind it you and I have the message
[20:24] this is what brother Branham came and
[20:27] gave his life for the 50 something years
[20:29] this right here is what he give his life
[20:31] for is to have a group of people sitting
[20:33] on the face of the earth that listens to
[20:35] the Word of God
[20:37] and gets a revelation remember what I
[20:41] said this morning those using them in
[20:42] Bible study you know we're in the fourth
[20:44] seal and we've been on this for almost
[20:46] eight months and we're just in the
[20:48] fourth seal and I've had ten parts on
[20:50] the fourth seal brother Brown preached
[20:52] one night the fourth seal the seal books
[20:57] not much bigger than this book but yet
[20:59] that's what's going to get us out of
[21:01] here
[21:01] so what do we have to do we have to get
[21:03] there revelation that's in there
[21:05] the revelation that's in those words
[21:07] it's not just the fourth seal is it's
[21:09] the pale horse rider no that fourth seal
[21:11] is the resurrection is the change of the
[21:13] money it's the rapture it's all the
[21:15] death has been destroyed death has been
[21:19] destroyed on that fourth seal we see
[21:21] death and Hell being on that scripture
[21:23] but they don't that's not we're not
[21:25] included in that we must separate
[21:28] ourselves that's our whole thing we have
[21:30] I was telling them this morning
[21:31] downstairs we have everything so common
[21:36] everything so common Israel when Israel
[21:41] started growing up in Egypt remember
[21:43] when Joseph they went down to Egypt and
[21:44] they started living and they started
[21:46] multiplying they were working for
[21:48] Pharaoh
[21:49] right they were not slaves at the time
[21:52] but they were working with feral then
[21:54] all of a sudden they got easy and they
[21:56] become slaves but when they become
[21:58] slaves feral one day says I want you to
[22:02] double your production I want you to do
[22:04] this without straw I want you to do this
[22:07] and you're not going to eat but one mill
[22:08] of dance to the three they started
[22:11] crying for a deliverer when that
[22:13] happened same way with us we've had so
[22:15] much ease in Zion to where I told them
[22:18] it's morning I said they when the
[22:20] parking lot full of cars there's
[22:21] probably a million dollars worth of cars
[22:23] in our little parking lot close to it if
[22:25] you counted them all up face value right
[22:28] and we were desperate that we're
[22:33] desperate the only thing we're desperate
[22:35] for is to make sure that Zaxby's has got
[22:37] chicken I said that cuz that's my
[22:41] desperation in tax means that take but
[22:46] in that trail I mean that's the truth so
[22:48] what do we you know so what are we doing
[22:50] we we have to see this as we've got to
[22:56] be prepared for something to happen
[23:00] Israel wasn't prepared
[23:03] they just got so easy down in Egypt till
[23:06] everything it's kind of like you know
[23:08] the old story that you know how to cook
[23:10] a frog right everybody knows how to cook
[23:12] a frog afraid of dad you've cooked many
[23:15] a turtle but I don't know if he's ever
[23:17] cooked the Frog yeah did he ever cook
[23:19] the Frog didn't think so Oscar was a
[23:22] good brother I enjoyed
[23:23] oh wait Ginny's in the back Jim Ginny's
[23:25] a lot older than Frieda so was it frog
[23:28] legs but if you took a frog though and
[23:30] put it in a bowl and pot of water what's
[23:32] the first thing it's going to do jump
[23:33] out but if you put it in that water and
[23:36] it's just about 70 degrees and then you
[23:38] just keep turning it up and turning it
[23:39] up and turn it up and turn it up and
[23:41] turn it up all the saying you got a bold
[23:43] frog if that's what you want but that's
[23:46] kind of like the way it is with us we've
[23:48] been so easy to where I think God now
[23:50] it's kind of turning the temperature up
[23:51] just a little bit trying to you know
[23:54] trying to keep us in line and keep us
[23:57] you say well why do we go to church
[23:59] every Wednesday never sunny why do we
[24:00] have to you know why because
[24:02] it keeps us ready for the time coming
[24:04] because we know the times coming we know
[24:08] we're in the time that is coming we're
[24:10] not in luthor we're now we got to go
[24:11] through justification i mean go through
[24:13] sanctification and the Holy Ghost and
[24:15] come into this age know we're in that
[24:16] age we're in the fourth age we must see
[24:20] that the son of man is hearing what he's
[24:22] doing oh we miss what we're here for
[24:25] but listen I promise you somebody will
[24:27] see it because God saw somebody see he
[24:31] threw for knowledge he saw somebody take
[24:34] this thing and carry it on if not then
[24:37] because remember he he doesn't cast his
[24:40] pearls before swine
[24:41] it will not return void his word because
[24:44] why when he speaks the word he already
[24:46] knows somebody's gonna take it so I let
[24:49] it be us I'm trying to give you a pep
[24:51] talk ever it's us it's not somebody else
[24:53] it's us you said you need a pep talk I
[24:56] need one every day when I get out of the
[24:58] bed I promise you when you get fifty
[25:00] eight years old you need a pep talk
[25:01] whether you give it to yourself or
[25:03] somebody else gives it to you you need a
[25:05] pep talk to get out of the bed spirits I
[25:09] mean naturally but not spiritually
[25:11] spiritually we do need a pep talk but
[25:12] this is where we get our pep talk we'll
[25:14] get our pep talk here hey madam when we
[25:16] mash play we get our pep talk because
[25:18] that's God talking to me telling me who
[25:20] I am or what I'm doing here
[25:21] all right so John 12:23 let's read this
[25:24] and then we'll continue them jesus
[25:27] answered them saying the hours come that
[25:30] the Son of man should be glorified ready
[25:33] verily I say unto you except a corn of
[25:34] wheat fall on the ground and die it
[25:36] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[25:38] forth much fruit Jesus Christ had to die
[25:41] the son of man had to die so that you
[25:45] and I could have life all right so
[25:48] that's talking about the Son of Man the
[25:50] corn of wheat fell in the ground we know
[25:53] that was back in the Dark Ages also but
[25:55] Jesus I believe right here because he
[25:57] says this is the hour that the Son of
[25:59] man should be glorified how is he gonna
[26:01] be glorified he's got died amen
[26:06] you and I remember I I'll find that
[26:08] quote maybe next Sunday brother Brown
[26:10] said we are his victory because if he
[26:13] resurrected his self and there's nobody
[26:16] else
[26:16] got it what good is it no he got on the
[26:21] cross for me and you he died for me and
[26:24] you and he resurrect you for me and you
[26:26] man cuz he had children that he foreknew
[26:28] those he foreknew he did predestinate
[26:31] we're talking about that this morning
[26:33] down in in romans 8 and 9 finally got
[26:37] through 8 but verily I say to you except
[26:40] a corn of wheat fall on the ground and
[26:41] died abideth alone but if it not bring
[26:42] forth much fruit so before we get into
[26:46] this I'm gonna read a few more but
[26:47] remember remember the sign phoenician
[26:51] woman she said thou son of David if you
[26:54] don't think a position means something
[26:56] or a title or RA approach to God doesn't
[27:01] mean anything it did to the Tsar
[27:04] Phoenician woman the sovereign nation
[27:06] woman was what Gentile she said thou son
[27:09] of David have mercy on me
[27:11] thou son of David have mercy on me the
[27:13] Bible says he's never even turned around
[27:15] brother Ram said he never even
[27:16] acknowledged she was talking to him so
[27:20] don't tell me the titles of that part
[27:22] and that dispensation doesn't mean
[27:24] something but she said my lord now when
[27:27] she said my lord that covered it all
[27:29] alright so that's the same way with you
[27:31] and I codes remember brother Branham
[27:32] said we would at the end time that you
[27:35] would say called Jesus Jesus is not
[27:37] getting anything why because you don't
[27:39] have a revelation who thy name is that's
[27:42] why you won't get anything but if you
[27:43] know who that man is and if you know
[27:46] where he is his character and what he's
[27:48] doing then when you say Jesus he turns
[27:55] and says yes what can I do for you amen
[28:01] so if it die if it doesn't die if it
[28:06] falls in the ground died abideth alone
[28:07] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[28:10] fruit so it had to die to bring me and
[28:12] you forth remember but you and I had to
[28:15] be brought into the dispensation that we
[28:18] are predestinated for remember brother
[28:23] Branham way and we're still talking
[28:25] about the Eagle anointing that's our
[28:27] anointing the Eagle anointing is our
[28:30] raise up higher be able to see further
[28:33] get more revelation and absolutely soar
[28:36] above all others now that doesn't make
[28:38] us better than anybody else but you know
[28:40] what this age is like brother Branham
[28:43] said in the countdown he said this is
[28:45] the astronaut age
[28:46] God has pressurized you to make it you
[28:51] Luthor couldn't made it Wesley couldn't
[28:54] made it Pentecostal couldn't make it but
[28:56] you can make it because the Prophet told
[28:59] us you can make it you were pressurized
[29:01] you know why you're pressurized for the
[29:03] job because you don't have a lot of
[29:05] questions think about it you don't have
[29:11] a lot of questions like others did
[29:13] Wesley could open the Bible and he had a
[29:15] revelation of what he was coming to do
[29:17] but he didn't have a full revelation he
[29:19] didn't have a full restoration he was
[29:21] just reforming right he was just
[29:23] reforming the people to an idea to a
[29:25] method but that's what God was using for
[29:28] the time but then he was still a
[29:29] Trinitarian so he looked through it with
[29:31] turnit Aryan glasses right but that's
[29:35] not that's not restoration restoration
[29:39] is back to where the faith of the
[29:40] father's never had a revelation of
[29:43] father son Holy Ghost never had a
[29:45] revelation of eternal hell that ain't a
[29:48] revelation not a revelation
[29:52] it's a revelation that it's wrong but
[29:58] yet it's still in the Word of God Jesus
[30:01] spoke it baptized in the name of the
[30:04] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[30:05] Ghost he said exactly what he was
[30:07] supposed to say but everybody took it as
[30:11] partial revelation and they said well
[30:14] we'll just baptizing G what jesus said
[30:16] we're not gonna worry about I mean the
[30:17] people who ever told you that and
[30:18] they've ever told you that they've told
[30:20] me they said well we'll take what Jesus
[30:22] said over what Peter said under that
[30:25] pentacon I said no they fightin each
[30:27] other in the Bible that's why they find
[30:31] each other I said I thought Jesus didn't
[30:34] have the keys to the kingdom I thought
[30:35] he gave him to Peter he said whatever
[30:37] you loose on earth i loosed in heaven
[30:39] whatever you bind on earth
[30:41] mind in heaven so when Peter turned that
[30:42] key God didn't say stop no no he said
[30:47] that's right so that's the way you have
[30:50] to look at but you know what that does
[30:51] take a revelation but but a revelation
[30:53] of Father Son and Holy Ghost being a
[30:54] true baptism is not a revelation the
[30:57] Trinity is not a revelation amen so but
[31:00] that's what I'm saying we now all have
[31:02] true revelant we have the revelation we
[31:05] have the faith of the fathers we have
[31:09] something to work with amen
[31:12] you and I have something to work with
[31:13] they didn't have everything to work with
[31:15] down through time you and I have
[31:17] something to work with
[31:19] weather and you know what it's whether
[31:21] you want to work it or not it's whether
[31:24] you want to work it or not you can work
[31:26] it if you want to and you don't have to
[31:27] you're still a free moral agent amen
[31:32] all right let's read John 11 will
[31:34] background just a minute and then we'll
[31:36] start mm-hmm continuing here John 11:21
[31:43] then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if I'd
[31:45] been here my brother had not died but I
[31:47] know that even now whatsoever that I
[31:50] will ask you God God will give it to
[31:51] them jesus said unto her thy brother
[31:53] shall rise again that's a good
[31:57] denominational idea amen that's a good
[32:01] that's cuz everybody thinks there's
[32:02] going to be a resurrection but what
[32:05] about a man standing there and said it's
[32:07] right here not coming it's right here
[32:11] because that's what he told Martha
[32:12] Martha senator I know all that he will
[32:14] rise again in the resurrection at the
[32:17] last day jesus said unto her I am the
[32:20] resurrection and the life he that
[32:22] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[32:25] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[32:27] believeth in me shall never die believe
[32:30] us now this know somebody's gonna
[32:32] fulfill that script or some kind of
[32:33] buddy's gonna believe that and he said
[32:36] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[32:37] shall never die
[32:38] believe it's tell this everybody okay
[32:43] all right now we know that when I
[32:46] remember back up here that death has to
[32:48] be destroyed in this in this time a
[32:51] restoration of all things has to take
[32:53] place a resurrection
[32:55] that's a take place and a rapture takes
[32:56] place on this seal so we have to y'all
[32:59] sleep back there Regina you put them all
[33:06] to sleep talking about your vacation Hey
[33:12] no remember death has to be destroyed
[33:22] Anderson knock on the window back there
[33:27] then ain't he's running the show
[33:31] Josh Josiah knew it when you were to be
[33:33] working Bob hey Bob Bob sittin right
[33:37] there everybody blame Bob I tell you
[33:43] while they fix that we were at a be
[33:44] meeting the other day and this guy was
[33:46] doing this program and the lights were
[33:48] down you know and he was bringing out
[33:50] his little program and he was talking to
[33:52] hello he was talking about this program
[33:54] and he started talking about this guy
[33:56] named the fat man man that how you
[33:57] didn't like his what he was doing and he
[33:59] didn't like the way he fed his bees and
[34:01] he didn't like it and somebody said he's
[34:03] sitting right there
[34:05] the guy was in the fat bee man was in
[34:09] the meeting and this guy Lord you
[34:11] talking about backing up and you hear
[34:13] that boy he just bless his heart glad
[34:19] the lights were off his face was
[34:20] probably as red as that but so it wasn't
[34:24] Bob Bob sitting right there wasn't Bob
[34:26] fault this has to be destroyed the
[34:28] restoration of all things take place the
[34:29] resurrection has to take place a rapture
[34:32] takes place on this seal so this seal
[34:34] death is destroyed now the son of man
[34:41] remember watch in the son of god
[34:44] dispensation you can't kill the son of
[34:46] God son of God is the eternal God
[34:49] Creator God will look at in a minute but
[34:51] the son of man had to die to bring him
[34:55] into brotherhood with me and you he had
[34:58] to become human flesh to be heirs and
[35:02] joy there he had to die
[35:04] but the only nine wants the Bible said
[35:07] he died once for all all right so he
[35:10] died so that we don't have to die
[35:13] that's Believix now this we got to
[35:19] believe that because I'm telling you
[35:22] just as soon as he stood and said all
[35:24] power in heaven has been given unto me
[35:25] brother Brown said potentially that your
[35:28] body was even justified sanctifies I
[35:30] mean glorified what he said 2,000 years
[35:39] 2,000 years from that point we're still
[35:42] dying when we don't have to Jesus never
[35:48] stood up and said all power in heaven
[35:50] there's been giving just to me
[35:52] no it's been given unto me and I say
[35:57] that you go get in a room and in ten
[36:01] days from now you're gonna get the Holy
[36:03] Ghost and I'm gonna come back and I'm
[36:05] gonna dwell in you and the things I do
[36:07] you sure do also amen that's the part we
[36:12] miss the things I do you sure do also
[36:16] all right let's read number one
[36:17] restoration of the bride tree I like to
[36:21] read this because we know that this is
[36:24] the end time this is the last there is
[36:27] no fifty there's no fifth messenger
[36:30] there's no there's no restoration past
[36:36] this time listen listen Israel and all
[36:41] that that's all that's not Gentile so
[36:43] you got separated because when I say
[36:46] when I run a restoration is oh it's
[36:48] restoration is over for the Gentiles not
[36:52] for the Jews
[36:53] they've got 144,000 is going to have to
[36:55] be restored and get the Holy Ghost after
[36:57] we're gone so you can't say it but when
[37:00] but when the preacher says alright you
[37:03] know we say well well it's all done when
[37:04] we well it's all done for us it's all
[37:08] done for us the son of man listen they
[37:11] won't get a son of man revelation
[37:14] 144,000 no no
[37:18] we are the only ones we are the only
[37:22] ones that get that revelation while
[37:24] we're alive on the earth think about
[37:29] that think about what that prophet
[37:32] brought so that we can have right now
[37:33] not go too sure it's gonna be easy in
[37:36] the millennium to understand the son of
[37:39] man we got to understand it now because
[37:42] the son of man he's been here the whole
[37:45] time that's just not been a revelation
[37:49] of who he is and where he's at for
[37:52] killers took it for messengers destroyed
[37:54] it for messengers of death took it away
[37:56] in Dogma for messengers of righteousness
[37:59] restored her back again prophesied son
[38:01] of man can these bones live which we had
[38:04] time got to wrote down but have to miss
[38:05] the prophesy can these bones live what's
[38:08] the four stages of that coming forth to
[38:09] the church what is that that's human
[38:12] flesh that's human bones as human sinew
[38:15] that's human muscle that's human flesh
[38:18] and then what is it human life life
[38:22] being blown into what's the four stages
[38:24] of Ezekiel dry bones but the life only
[38:27] comes not when the sinew was on them but
[38:29] when the wind blowed upon them
[38:31] that's the hour you and I are living in
[38:33] that's when it comes back that fourth
[38:36] message you notice he didn't say
[38:39] messenger there he said that fourth
[38:41] message of life I will restore stay at
[38:45] the Lord hallelujah glory praise be to
[38:46] God the fourth light is to come that
[38:49] will bring forth the same signs watch
[38:51] justification brought back the Pulte
[38:52] sanctification brought back the bark
[38:54] doctor of holiness walk ball back to
[38:56] leave Pentecost now look to get back
[38:59] with what I'm going to say in a minute
[39:01] these are all these are all the son of
[39:06] God in the church ages this is the son
[39:10] of God in the church ages walk bought
[39:13] breaks the leaves Pentecost he didn't
[39:14] say these was wrong this is what was
[39:15] bringing it back okay what brought it
[39:18] back the leaves Pentecost what is it
[39:20] Pentecost release clapping of the hands
[39:21] joy bridge Orson Pentecost what the
[39:23] forth was the word itself the word made
[39:27] flesh fruits of the proof of the
[39:30] resurrection sign that
[39:31] crisis finally after justification had
[39:34] been planted sanctification planted
[39:36] baptism of the holy ghost all these had
[39:38] to be planted and it had to be planted
[39:41] in me and you because you and I we
[39:43] understand listen there's a part of
[39:48] justification that nobody understood but
[39:50] us a mysterious part he's talking about
[39:54] a mysterious part of sanctification a
[39:56] mysterious part of the baptism the Holy
[39:58] Ghost
[39:58] you know what the mysterious part of the
[40:00] baptism the Holy Ghost to me starts it's
[40:02] not down here that's right here that's
[40:07] the mysterious part that man has left
[40:09] off they just said all we got the Holy
[40:11] Ghost we got the Holy Ghost shout speak
[40:12] in tongues just like I said Pentecost
[40:14] wave it whoa we got it brother Bronson
[40:17] didn't say they didn't have it he said
[40:20] they cabbies down and stopped and God
[40:23] moved on that plus he said that's good
[40:28] but plus means more what the forth was
[40:31] the word self the word made flesh fruits
[40:33] for the proof of the Resurrection son
[40:34] that Christ has finally after
[40:36] justification been planted same case
[40:38] you've been playing baptism of the Holy
[40:39] Ghost organizations died out and Christ
[40:43] has again centered himself like that cap
[40:46] of the pyramid you see it right back
[40:47] then first wine justification
[40:49] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[40:51] then coming of the captain he's talking
[40:53] about the capstone revelation and who is
[40:56] the headstone the son of man is the
[40:59] headstone the son of man is the
[41:01] headstone so you and I we get that part
[41:05] what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being
[41:08] honed out right now he's talking to you
[41:19] I'm gonna say this with all sincerity I
[41:23] love reading the Bible and don't get me
[41:26] wrong it does talk about me but this
[41:30] prophets message because this this is to
[41:33] Christians all around chews gentle and
[41:36] so is this but that's talking to me when
[41:40] that thing came when that message come
[41:42] at home down home down to where it's
[41:45] talking to
[41:45] he was telling us how to get out of here
[41:47] you and me not another group me and you
[41:51] now I don't take this over the Bible you
[41:54] understand don't get me wrong but when I
[41:56] read this I go man God is talking to me
[42:01] he said a man personally to talk to me
[42:04] he didn't seem to talk to you he seemed
[42:05] talking to me
[42:07] you got to say the same thing what is it
[42:10] that Holy Ghost months being honed out
[42:12] so that it can fit with the same kind of
[42:14] ministry he had when he went away that
[42:17] when he comes back it'll catch the whole
[42:21] thing in the rapture where the justified
[42:23] sanctified and the baptism of the Holy
[42:25] Ghost that pyramid will stand again the
[42:28] house of God will live again the Tree of
[42:30] Life is growing again what is it it's a
[42:34] bride tree why do you preach the
[42:36] resurrection of the or restoration of
[42:38] the bride tree amen thereby all right
[42:42] with that say ma'am
[42:43] all right proving his word number two
[42:45] we've read this from before I want to
[42:46] read it again
[42:47] this would be about time number five I'm
[42:49] like brother Claude if I read it 17
[42:51] times you'll get it now after 1900 years
[42:55] with the church ages past now what she's
[42:58] putting it in position and all things
[42:59] that he prophesied of Luther Wesley we
[43:01] just went through and seeing it drawing
[43:03] out the moon came down brought it out
[43:04] the Lord wrote it on the board here for
[43:07] us and showed it come down himself and
[43:08] confirmed it right after 1900 years and
[43:12] we're at the end of the Laodicean Church
[43:14] age he promised in Luke 17 30 that this
[43:18] same son of man he promised it would be
[43:22] revealed in the days like it was in
[43:24] Sodom upon the earth did he do it does
[43:27] it have to come to pass it's impossible
[43:29] now remember he came in three names the
[43:32] son of man a prophet the son of God the
[43:35] spirit now he's talking about Jesus when
[43:37] Jesus come he came the Son of Man all
[43:40] right then
[43:41] the Son of God the spirit down through 7
[43:44] Church ages will draw it out in a minute
[43:45] then the son of David for the Millennium
[43:47] but in between this conjunction now
[43:52] what's the conjunction the conjunction
[43:55] is between this and this because
[43:58] remember
[43:59] and don't get me wrong but you have two
[44:01] wipeouts under david for me and you and
[44:04] that's not to us
[44:06] sour Phoenician woman son of David have
[44:10] mercy we don't need that part so mark
[44:14] that one off for me and you but now that
[44:16] does go into the Millennium we know that
[44:19] but you and I have to get the Son of God
[44:21] in the Son of Man right the son of David
[44:24] will come when we get all those other
[44:26] parts right that ok but in between this
[44:29] conjunction now why is it got to be
[44:32] because remember God died in human flesh
[44:37] God resurrected in human flesh God went
[44:41] took a glorified body into another
[44:43] dimension in human flesh sent back his
[44:45] spirit to get into the believer to get
[44:48] them to understand what he's already
[44:50] said or understand the Word of God all
[44:52] right now according to his own words in
[44:54] the day when the Son of man shall be
[44:56] revealed that's now reveal himself as
[45:01] what not son of God son of man will
[45:04] reveal his self in a different way I
[45:06] want you to read that reveal yourself in
[45:08] a different way we'll show you maybe the
[45:19] different way in just a minute
[45:22] let's read number three we've been
[45:25] reading these we're gonna read them
[45:26] again because I don't want you to get
[45:31] confused yourself go to the next one
[45:33] please the anointing once a ten-time
[45:36] what is it not the angel as the son of
[45:38] man so get it out your head brother
[45:41] brown wedding son a man okay there's no
[45:44] one can be the Son of Man except Jesus
[45:46] Christ you can't a human being can't do
[45:49] what he did he's all he was human yeah
[45:52] he was human he was God what none of us
[45:56] in this building virgin-born
[45:57] so that just absolutely I'm just talking
[46:00] to y'all so that just kind of disc ludes
[46:02] us that's being the son of man okay so
[46:05] if you think William Branham is the son
[46:07] of man then he was virgin born and that
[46:08] ain't true we know that you like like
[46:11] somebody said ask him
[46:14] remember what they said that brother
[46:16] Browns kids were Immaculate Conception
[46:18] he spoke them into existence somebody
[46:19] said you need to ask sister Mita about
[46:21] that how silly and stupid and that is
[46:25] stupid because there's only one man he
[46:27] had to be the virgin born son of God
[46:30] because the Bible made him the virgin
[46:32] born son of God
[46:33] amen so let's give honor her honors do
[46:36] not the angel as the son of man but the
[46:38] messenger is revealing the son of man
[46:41] can you get it separated now that's
[46:43] where it seems to be so hard for you you
[46:45] see not the son of man himself but the
[46:47] seventh angel the seventh messenger is
[46:49] revealing to the public the Son of Man
[46:54] because it's left - shuk can't organize
[46:57] it it's the grain itself again because
[47:00] remember the corn of wheat when it went
[47:01] into the ground that was the son of man
[47:03] that went in they planted the son of man
[47:08] over there in Jerusalem in that tomb on
[47:10] the side of a mountain right and then
[47:13] that son of man came out of that tomb
[47:14] God with human flesh and said I all
[47:18] power and heaven earth been given unto
[47:19] me so it's the grain but what happened
[47:22] is is that thing went back in the ground
[47:25] and it's come back today into the
[47:29] full-grain the revelation of the Son of
[47:31] Man all right now let's read number 4
[47:33] now who is this son of man rising of the
[47:37] Sun this is quote number 4 in the
[47:40] beginning was the word now who is the
[47:42] son of man in the beginning was word was
[47:45] with god and the word was gone the word
[47:46] was made flesh and dwelt among us and if
[47:49] all the teaching that we have in
[47:50] confirmation of the word of God by word
[47:53] of god by signs by wonders we see today
[47:55] that in the Book of Luke here that we
[47:58] just quoted from the Luke the 17th and
[48:00] 30th verse Malachi 4 different
[48:02] scriptures we're acquainted with that
[48:03] the word again is waved over the people
[48:05] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[48:09] denominational ideas and the son of God
[48:11] is alive again with the baptism of the
[48:13] Holy Spirit right among us and it's
[48:15] giving us life alright so now let's read
[48:18] number 5 3rd Exodus
[48:24] so that's the way it is again today cuz
[48:26] I want you to know something you and I
[48:28] this is for me and you so that's the way
[48:32] it is again today God is calling his
[48:34] elected people has he not called you you
[48:37] he's called you people you sitting in
[48:39] this building you have been called but
[48:42] what have you been called to you well
[48:45] I'm just in the message like brother
[48:47] Dale said this morning night you know I
[48:48] I could I don't cut my hair and I folks
[48:51] that's a laundry list
[48:53] that's a laundry list that we should be
[48:58] past leaving again the principles the
[49:00] doctrine of Christ let's go on to
[49:01] perfection okay and they are elected now
[49:05] and now they are elected for what now
[49:09] look we are elected for a resurrection
[49:11] and what kind of sign is he's showing
[49:14] them resurrection sign he showed the
[49:18] sign to me and you we are the elected
[49:21] for what for a resurrection you and I
[49:25] he's talking to us we are elected for a
[49:29] resurrection that's our box if you want
[49:31] to call it all right so now let's read
[49:35] right here and then will for a few
[49:38] minutes will drawn on the board who is
[49:42] this son of man Matthew 13 737 242 the
[49:47] parable of the store the seed now who
[49:48] was the sword the seed the Son of Man in
[49:54] listen listen in type because remember
[50:01] the Son of man has no well well you
[50:05] might say the Son of Man the Son of Man
[50:07] Jesus himself the man did have seed as a
[50:10] human mortal man but that ain't what
[50:13] this is talking about that's what got us
[50:15] in trouble so get off of it that's the
[50:17] part the guys in trouble we should have
[50:19] been the spoken word is the original see
[50:21] that's what he come for he come to speak
[50:23] us into existence he come to spread the
[50:26] seed Word of God the field is the world
[50:29] the good seed are the children of the
[50:32] kingdom but the tares are the children
[50:35] of the wicked one he the so it
[50:38] good seed is the son of man he actually
[50:42] gave you an opportunity to be born the
[50:47] second time he gave you the ability to
[50:50] be born again because your mom and daddy
[50:53] gave you a natural seed to be born the
[50:55] first time the Son of Man sowed the good
[50:58] seed amen brother Dale's been reading
[51:01] you were not born we're not born again
[51:02] of corruptible seed we're born of
[51:06] incorruptible seed which is the Word of
[51:08] God I wish people would get that
[51:10] everybody's you know you they get these
[51:13] wild ideas about this seed God's seed is
[51:22] his word period there's no little
[51:24] wiggling squiggly tail thing running
[51:27] around in God that was you know you were
[51:29] entwined in God's DNA which is his word
[51:32] his word is his power amen and you and I
[51:37] are intertwined in that if we're born
[51:40] again believers now right that makes you
[51:42] the children of God rather than a are
[51:45] the children of the devil you were born
[51:48] the children of the devil why you were
[51:51] born between Satan and Eve what the act
[51:52] the physical act that's our problem but
[51:58] God had to come down a human flesh to
[52:01] show the good seed remember he didn't
[52:04] have no physical children but what was
[52:06] he doing every time he was speaking for
[52:07] three and a half years he was what he
[52:09] was sowing the seed word so that you and
[52:14] I could be born because you and I are
[52:15] born by the Word of God amen that all
[52:19] right to me that's just so simple
[52:21] Matthew 16 when Jesus came to the coasts
[52:24] of Caesarea Philippi he asked his
[52:25] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[52:28] the Son of Man am now that was the
[52:33] question we've been through this before
[52:35] but some of you knew and but we're gonna
[52:38] cover it again whom do men say that I
[52:41] the Son of Man I am now
[52:45] now that was it's not a man that's what
[52:51] he asked all right
[52:55] and they said some say you're John the
[52:58] Baptist some say you're Elijah and
[53:03] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[53:05] he saith unto them but whom say you that
[53:09] I am you've heard all these rumors who
[53:12] do you say I am and Simon Peter answered
[53:15] and said thou art the Christ the Son of
[53:18] God right then he didn't say you're the
[53:25] Son of Man right
[53:30] don't Peter said thou art the Christ the
[53:33] Son of the Living God in other words
[53:37] we'll see them in the you were the
[53:39] Creator God they knew he would somewhere
[53:41] in that body was a creator somewhere
[53:45] somewhere in there somewhere you
[53:50] wherever you will try to figure that out
[53:52] in a minute
[53:53] and jesus answered and said unto him
[53:55] blessed art thou that he didn't say now
[53:56] Simon you didn't answer my question
[53:59] he answered it the best of his ability
[54:01] and actually I don't believe you
[54:04] understood it because it didn't come
[54:06] from him flesh and blood didn't reveal
[54:12] that to you but my father which is in
[54:14] heaven and I say unto thee that thou art
[54:17] Peter and upon this revelation not the
[54:22] revelation of what he asked remember you
[54:26] asked this question he got this answer
[54:32] and upon this revelation I'll build my
[54:35] church
[54:36] okay I'll build my church what is the
[54:40] church we're going to make it real
[54:41] simple that's going to be what seven
[54:46] church ages that's the Church of God
[54:48] started on the day of Pentecost and will
[54:51] end the Gentile ones when we go in the
[54:53] rapture all right that's the Son of God
[54:56] revelation
[55:02] upon this rock I'll build my church all
[55:06] right son of God is the spirit but now
[55:14] he didn't begin right here
[55:16] he began way over here and let me let me
[55:20] draw this he began in infinity you say
[55:25] beginning infinity is even wrong
[55:28] somebody got that started smiling you
[55:30] know but yeah he began in infinity but
[55:34] wait a minute the Bible says we're gonna
[55:37] read it in a minute and we're gonna tie
[55:38] this together with something he says the
[55:42] beginning of the creation of God now
[55:43] that's kind of that's what the Bible
[55:46] says so we had to have a prophet come
[55:48] and tell us so we had to brother Brown
[55:50] says what he said back before the
[55:53] eternal way back over here where there
[55:56] was no explanation of who he was he
[55:59] drops down into a form called the Son of
[56:02] God now I'm doing away with a bunch of
[56:05] quotes but if you don't know what he
[56:06] said by now you need to study because
[56:11] the son of God is the creator he's the
[56:13] one that stepped out and said come from
[56:15] Elohim the logos all the way down and
[56:17] spoke and said let there be
[56:19] let there be let there be let there be
[56:22] do you know there's somebody inside of
[56:24] you that when you look at pending stars
[56:31] he got he you were in him before they
[56:34] were now that don't make you nothing but
[56:41] it makes God something when his very
[56:44] thoughts was before those stars that are
[56:46] up in the sky because remember they had
[56:48] a beginning you don't preach that
[56:55] that'll help you there but look that's
[56:57] what you got inside of you and you know
[56:59] why brother Branham said you know why he
[57:01] said he what he said he said you have
[57:03] enough power in you to create a world
[57:08] why because the one who created the
[57:10] worlds within you
[57:11] I'm telling you we this is our problem
[57:15] this is us and this is God that's our
[57:21] problem
[57:24] this is us and this is God same line
[57:30] that's our problem we're like I said
[57:32] we're tunas more than we are wanting
[57:35] more than we are true oneness but the
[57:37] Son of God when you when you say who is
[57:39] the son of God that's what the
[57:41] revelation who didn't because remember
[57:43] who did he say it came from my father
[57:49] which is in heaven
[57:52] there's the creation there's the creator
[57:54] that's brother branham called it many
[57:57] things but you can call theophany the
[58:00] logos the speech the son of God was the
[58:04] creator and he was standing there in
[58:09] eternity amen then he comes down through
[58:14] the Old Testament thereby okay he comes
[58:18] down through the Old Testament as that
[58:20] person that understanding let's put it
[58:23] that way he come as that understanding
[58:25] cuz there's only one person of God okay
[58:28] but to be revealed to me and you listen
[58:31] this is where it's got to be this is
[58:34] where it's got to be because this is the
[58:36] way he told the Prophet and if the
[58:37] prophet he told it to the Prophet the
[58:39] Prophet told of us so it's got to be
[58:41] true so here's the Son of God the
[58:43] theophany the Genesis 1:26 man this man
[58:46] never fail even though this man was
[58:53] inside because remember if you look at
[58:55] your genealogy what did they call Adam
[58:59] then call Adam son of man they called
[59:03] him son of God because he was that
[59:06] original son that was supposed to watch
[59:09] speak and bring things forth right
[59:12] that's why I said I said Adams purpose
[59:15] was to bring me in you without sex
[59:19] spoken word because it didn't take sex
[59:21] to create the
[59:23] globen no gout no it was what his
[59:26] thought come down to a speech
[59:28] so there's your son of God the Son of
[59:31] God revelation takes for you from
[59:32] eternity to eternity but now remember it
[59:36] never fell it never sinned it never let
[59:47] me try to focus on something here it did
[59:51] not need a revelation hey no that's what
[1:00:00] I'm trying to say hang on just a minute
[1:00:01] because if we would see plainly this son
[1:00:05] of God it wouldn't be because right
[1:00:07] here's where he's hid the most not let
[1:00:10] me put it that way maybe the maybe the
[1:00:12] most he's hid is in the son of man cause
[1:00:14] nobody understood it they can understand
[1:00:16] the I worked across senator living god
[1:00:17] you're the creator god you're the
[1:00:19] Creator God all down through these
[1:00:21] church ages but they missed this one
[1:00:23] even when he come they missed him when
[1:00:27] he came they said well you're the son of
[1:00:30] God but remember the son of God is a
[1:00:33] spirit dot down through the Old
[1:00:36] Testament now remember that was Jehovah
[1:00:39] brother Brahim explained it many times
[1:00:40] God above us then he dropped down into
[1:00:43] the son of man God with us then he come
[1:00:47] back to the Son of God again but God in
[1:00:49] us above us with us and in us but why is
[1:00:55] right here right in here we got to have
[1:00:59] something in this conjecture because
[1:01:03] this is what this is son of David when
[1:01:11] we go in the rapture I don't want I want
[1:01:13] to stop right here if I don't do nothing
[1:01:14] else when we go into rapture God sure he
[1:01:18] goes to the Jews to get to 144,000 let's
[1:01:21] just put three and a half years or seven
[1:01:22] actually seven years over here he comes
[1:01:26] as the son of God because it's the Holy
[1:01:27] Ghost there buddy okay it's the Holy
[1:01:31] Ghost in the believer it's the Holy
[1:01:33] Ghost in the believer down to the church
[1:01:35] ages like
[1:01:36] said the Son of God never never fell
[1:01:39] thereby okay with that we can draw a
[1:01:43] line so this was the Holy Ghost for
[1:01:45] those of you that don't know that that
[1:01:47] Holy Ghost is what brother Branham said
[1:01:49] he came back on the day of Pentecost in
[1:01:51] the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:53] Ghost the soul of God and came into the
[1:01:56] believer and made him children of God
[1:01:59] upon this rock I'll build my church so
[1:02:02] he built all this on the revelation of
[1:02:06] the Son of God but right here he came as
[1:02:11] the son of man himself the person Jesus
[1:02:15] right okay okay so now we're back to
[1:02:21] what brother Branham said a minute ago
[1:02:22] he came as the son of man son of God son
[1:02:27] of David but right in this conjecture he
[1:02:31] has to come back as the son of man
[1:02:34] why why why do you have to come back to
[1:02:44] the son of man because the son of man is
[1:02:47] the only one that took a body change the
[1:02:51] son of man is my brother now sure we
[1:02:54] know for a fact right here that he was
[1:02:57] the son of God in seven Church ages amen
[1:03:00] that's the Holy Ghost son of God's
[1:03:06] Spirit God that spirit God went into the
[1:03:10] believers and made them born-again
[1:03:12] Christians with the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:14] Ghost but no rapture no body change no
[1:03:21] resurrection they'll be all right with
[1:03:24] that there's never been a shirt and I
[1:03:26] don't get me wrong
[1:03:27] people have been resurrected but they've
[1:03:30] died again I'm done by the resurrection
[1:03:33] like Jesus had a resurrection now he's
[1:03:36] one that had it he's the one who can
[1:03:38] tell us about it he saw all the Son of
[1:03:41] God can tell us anything yeah okay all
[1:03:43] right he's all-knowing but why do you
[1:03:45] become the Son of Man if we didn't even
[1:03:47] understand what he was doing
[1:03:49] he come down here to be our brother to
[1:03:52] show the ability for us to come but
[1:03:56] remember he left and didn't come back at
[1:04:02] the Son of man in the church angel he
[1:04:04] came back as the son of garden of church
[1:04:05] Asia but right before the coming of the
[1:04:09] rapture he has to come back at the Son
[1:04:11] of Man I just read it to you brother
[1:04:12] Brown many many many many many times so
[1:04:17] I believe we have a revelation of the
[1:04:20] Son of God if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:04:23] today you have some sort of revelation
[1:04:25] of who he is if he's living inside of
[1:04:27] you you ought to have some semblance of
[1:04:29] a revelation of who he is and what he's
[1:04:32] doing he's helping you live a good
[1:04:33] Christian life but the son of man was
[1:04:37] God in flesh that was changed that was
[1:04:42] resurrected but also that came to earth
[1:04:45] and ate like you and I ate that bled
[1:04:48] like you and I bled that all right but
[1:04:52] he had to go away he had to leave but
[1:04:59] I'll come again
[1:05:00] tell no one this vision until the Son of
[1:05:04] Man remember he died right here this is
[1:05:08] the cross he died right here where else
[1:05:11] did he die son of man be risen again he
[1:05:15] died in the church ages they killed him
[1:05:22] but he's got to come back in power to
[1:05:24] teach me and you how to take a body
[1:05:25] change that's the whole purpose
[1:05:28] it's the four that son of man to be back
[1:05:31] in me and you and I'll have some quotes
[1:05:33] in that Sunday about all the son of man
[1:05:35] being in the bride not one person it's
[1:05:38] going to be in the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:41] not just one man all right they're very
[1:05:44] okay with that because you look this is
[1:05:50] what's going to be hard everybody okay
[1:05:51] now we got son of God's the Spirit God
[1:05:53] he's the one that created all things
[1:05:55] then he comes as the son of man in ad
[1:05:59] whoever for when he was born to a t30 he
[1:06:02] dies crucified
[1:06:03] rose again standing in a glorified body
[1:06:06] takes a resurrection comes back on the
[1:06:09] day of Pentecost as the son of God as he
[1:06:11] promised he builds his church on that
[1:06:14] alright and then he's got to come back
[1:06:17] at the son of man listen who in the
[1:06:19] world would have known that except for
[1:06:21] the prophet in the end time nobody would
[1:06:23] have known that you know why because
[1:06:25] nobody ever preached it to start with
[1:06:27] even Paul Irena smart none of them
[1:06:31] covered that son of man like William
[1:06:33] Branham did nobody you say well how do
[1:06:35] you know because the seven seals had to
[1:06:37] reveal the Son of Man the opening of
[1:06:40] those seals that we're talking about
[1:06:41] right now is telling you that your flesh
[1:06:44] can be changed
[1:06:46] let's just be real honest people down
[1:06:50] through the church ages did not rely on
[1:06:53] some message to take them to a body
[1:06:56] change when I die hallelujah by and by
[1:07:02] I'll fly away that's not much of a
[1:07:05] revelation in this day when I die and
[1:07:10] all these other deaths things well
[1:07:12] that's all they saw that but late but
[1:07:15] they knew that was going to come up
[1:07:16] Martha oh I know in the last days we're
[1:07:20] gonna resurrect jesus said my lord I am
[1:07:24] the resurrection believe in me believe
[1:07:30] this now this I'm telling you today in
[1:07:33] 2018 believe us now this that that same
[1:07:37] man that walked the shores of Galilee is
[1:07:39] walking in you and the same ministry is
[1:07:44] back in you the message of the opening
[1:07:51] of the seals it's for you and you only
[1:07:55] hey come on people there's things that I
[1:07:59] told you and I never tell you why she's
[1:08:03] my wife do you ever talk to you love her
[1:08:09] enough to figure out what he wants to do
[1:08:11] hmm because you got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:16] that's what many people and I'm sorry to
[1:08:20] say I've never heard anybody preach on
[1:08:22] the statue a perfect man except us here
[1:08:24] in this church have you I want you to
[1:08:27] raise your hand I want you to take short
[1:08:29] dummy all right one stood right there
[1:08:31] somebody preached on the Son of Man
[1:08:32] that's one hand out of about 80 but
[1:08:37] that's what's important that's the
[1:08:38] problem what a lot of people are getting
[1:08:40] the Holy Ghost and they say well I I got
[1:08:42] it and that's okay you're going to
[1:08:46] heaven but I want God to work in me like
[1:08:48] he worked when he was standing on the
[1:08:50] face of the earth he worked through one
[1:08:53] man called William Branham for a little
[1:08:55] while
[1:08:55] but he promised they'd work through all
[1:08:57] of us all of us from women to children
[1:09:00] to men it doesn't matter
[1:09:02] that's what I'm looking for I want the
[1:09:06] devil now look he destroyed the effects
[1:09:09] of the devil right there at Calvary but
[1:09:11] remember it's not going to be applied it
[1:09:13] hasn't even been applied to the church
[1:09:15] ages it's going to be applied to us for
[1:09:17] a short time and then 144,000 s got to
[1:09:20] die but then we got a glorious
[1:09:24] millennium but you know what's gonna
[1:09:25] happen in the Millennium Satan's still
[1:09:27] gonna be alive he's still gonna be there
[1:09:29] right but not that future home people
[1:09:33] that future home you'll see lots of son
[1:09:37] of man walking around in that new city
[1:09:39] so who is this son of man he's a
[1:09:45] revelation of the seven seals
[1:09:46] he's a revelation that your body can be
[1:09:49] changed nobody ain't nobody believed
[1:09:52] that hey hate the people in the message
[1:09:56] don't believe that you're gonna take a
[1:09:58] body change oh they say you're gonna
[1:10:00] take a body change but they say you're
[1:10:02] gonna get a new one that I need a change
[1:10:04] that's exchange like I said let's go
[1:10:07] back again that'd be easy for God to do
[1:10:09] just say all mark you've been living in
[1:10:11] an old Sam body just throw it down over
[1:10:14] yon and I'll give you a new that's not
[1:10:17] the way done Jesus he didn't just throw
[1:10:19] the body out in the desert like somebody
[1:10:21] preached you know no that man had nail
[1:10:25] prints in his hand
[1:10:26] but he ate fish and he walked to a wall
[1:10:31] that's the god I serve that's a god I
[1:10:34] have but do you know what the here's our
[1:10:37] problem we've read this one scripture

[1:10:51] gonna read this it started to be a
[1:10:56] little bit lone but everybody be alright
[1:11:02] revelations 1 verse 10 I was in the
[1:11:04] spirit on the Lord's Day and heard
[1:11:05] behind me a great voice of the trumpet
[1:11:06] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[1:11:09] and the last what they'll see us write
[1:11:11] in the book and sending them to the
[1:11:12] seven churches which are in Asia and
[1:11:14] Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis
[1:11:18] Philadelphia allowed us them and I
[1:11:20] turned to see the voice that spake with
[1:11:21] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:11:22] candlesticks and they're right here but
[1:11:25] I want you to watch what he showed John
[1:11:29] what he showed John alright
[1:11:33] in turn see the voice is paid with me
[1:11:35] and I turned I saw seven golden
[1:11:36] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:11:38] seven golden candlesticks one like unto
[1:11:40] the Son of Man clothed with the garment
[1:11:43] down to the foot and Girt about the paps
[1:11:44] with a golden girdle okay alright
[1:11:47] alright with that his head in his hair
[1:11:50] with white as wool and why does no one
[1:11:51] his eyes were flame to fire his feet was
[1:11:54] like brass as if they burned in the
[1:11:55] furnace his voice is the sound of many
[1:11:56] waters he had in his hand in seven stars
[1:11:59] now what was the seven stars that was
[1:12:00] the seven churches I mean seven
[1:12:03] messengers and out of his mouth was the
[1:12:05] two-edged sword and a watch let's not

[1:12:08] but now it's read 18 I am he that liveth
[1:12:11] and was dead
[1:12:13] I am heat now he's telling you who he
[1:12:17] was
[1:12:18] there's the son of man there stood the
[1:12:22] son of man because he was dead at one
[1:12:24] time that flesh if that man walked in
[1:12:27] died I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:12:31] and behold I am Alive for evermore amen
[1:12:35] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:12:39] some
[1:12:40] we're in that fourth seal he takes those
[1:12:44] keys and makes them manifest why did
[1:12:47] this what is a seal listen and I looked
[1:12:50] and behold a pale horse and his name
[1:12:51] that sat on him was death and hell
[1:12:53] followed with him that's the fourth seal
[1:12:57] right here he is already an i elated
[1:13:00] that and have the keys of hell and of
[1:13:04] death now let's read what brother
[1:13:05] Branham says about it on the 7th church
[1:13:07] age 1954 now that's the Bible then
[1:13:11] what's the spirit said see the
[1:13:12] candlesticks all right now the 13th
[1:13:14] verse and in the midst of the seven
[1:13:16] golden candlesticks one like the Son of
[1:13:18] Man what one like him who was this his
[1:13:23] bride hmm who was this his bride one
[1:13:29] like him watch how it was clothed with
[1:13:31] the garment down to the foot the
[1:13:33] holiness of Jesus Christ covering her he
[1:13:35] washed us from our sins with his own
[1:13:37] blood all right girded about the paps
[1:13:40] not a man roll it up please not a man a
[1:13:46] woman with a golden girdle the gospel
[1:13:50] that held the power and glory of God
[1:13:51] over the body of Christ oh what a
[1:13:53] beautiful picture we get here under
[1:13:54] consideration and then he says down to
[1:13:57] the foot you know where it was that keep
[1:13:59] going down to where it says words read
[1:14:01] save time here keep going keep going and
[1:14:05] his feet were like fine brass that's
[1:14:08] telling you last Sunday I want to
[1:14:09] brother branham to explain it to you
[1:14:10] brass always his judgment now if his
[1:14:13] feet was like brass it was the believers
[1:14:17] in the seven churches right that's why I
[1:14:19] said we do not stand in judgment we
[1:14:23] stand as judge and then brass always his
[1:14:27] judgment you know the brazen altar and
[1:14:29] the brass serpent so forth brass speaks
[1:14:31] of judgment his feet then the Church of
[1:14:34] Jesus Christ is set upon divine judgment
[1:14:38] imaginable right with that you and I
[1:14:40] will judge angels you and I will judge
[1:14:43] the world I read that to you believe
[1:14:46] it's now this Amen believe it's now this
[1:14:50] and I want to read you this let's go to
[1:14:51] Revelation 3:15 and let's see what's
[1:14:53] going to happen
[1:14:54] here I kind of I kind of you know
[1:15:00] sometimes you and you do it as well as I
[1:15:03] do you think you got a revelation and
[1:15:05] then sometimes you don't but then you
[1:15:09] what then when you find a quote where
[1:15:10] brother branham confirms that revelation
[1:15:13] you thank God for it
[1:15:15] because he didn't send that prophet to
[1:15:17] you he sent him to me and I've already
[1:15:18] told you them and to the angel of the
[1:15:21] church of the laodiceans right now this
[1:15:22] is me and you these things saith the
[1:15:25] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:15:26] beginning of the creation of God now who
[1:15:28] was the beginning of the creation of God
[1:15:30] the Son of God no he was the creator who
[1:15:33] was the beginning of the creation to God
[1:15:35] the Son of man you saw how in the world
[1:15:37] that's the way the creation should have
[1:15:41] been had there not been a fall Jesus
[1:15:44] came virgin born spoken word of God you
[1:15:48] and I come the same way huh when you're
[1:15:55] born again you're not born again a sex
[1:15:57] you born again in the spoken word of God
[1:16:01] the beginning of the creation of God and
[1:16:04] brother Branham says you and I are the
[1:16:06] King yet continuation of that creation I
[1:16:08] know that works that they don't need a
[1:16:11] coal in their heart now this is us I
[1:16:12] would thou wert cold or hot so then
[1:16:14] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:16:16] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:16:18] mouth because I said I am rich and
[1:16:21] increased with Goods and have need of
[1:16:22] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[1:16:23] wretched miserable poor and blind and
[1:16:26] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[1:16:28] tried in the fire that thou may us be
[1:16:30] rich talking to me and you know and what
[1:16:34] raiment that thou must be closed that
[1:16:36] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[1:16:37] in the north of all eyes with eyesalve
[1:16:39] that thou mayst see as many as I love I
[1:16:43] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[1:16:44] and repent now listen this is not in any
[1:16:47] other Church age this next statement
[1:16:51] this is for us this is our box behold I
[1:16:56] stand at the door knock hold on a minute
[1:17:05] that has to be a man standing there
[1:17:10] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[1:17:15] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:17:17] I will come into him and what's up with
[1:17:20] him
[1:17:20] and here with me now for a long time I
[1:17:24] saw that's got to be the son of man
[1:17:26] that's not the Son of God the Son of God
[1:17:30] never was put out of the church Bob
[1:17:34] son of god was never put out of the
[1:17:35] church it's the son of God down through
[1:17:38] 7 Church ages folks who would put out of
[1:17:41] the church the Son of Man was put out of
[1:17:44] the church and couldn't get back in I
[1:17:47] have a quote go to the next one if you
[1:17:52] don't believe it but I'll let brother
[1:17:53] Ram tell you feast of the trumpets 1964
[1:17:55] words now listen loosening of these a
[1:17:56] classic leads ethical spears now 20
[1:17:59] years later after that war we see the
[1:18:00] loosening of the ecclesiastical spear
[1:18:02] one under the seventh seal that's us the
[1:18:05] seventh trumpet of the Jews look at the
[1:18:07] moon darkening out what the intent when
[1:18:09] did the moon darken out in the loudest
[1:18:11] and church age remember he drew that
[1:18:14] little bit of light that was left in the
[1:18:15] loudest in church they show he's talking
[1:18:17] about us so it drawn out the son of man
[1:18:20] being drove from the church not the son
[1:18:24] of God the Son of Man that's what
[1:18:26] brother Dale's been preaching and that's
[1:18:28] what thrilled my soul this morning
[1:18:30] that's what he's preaching the son of
[1:18:32] man is what was drove out of the church
[1:18:33] not the son of God
[1:18:35] that's not the son of God standing at
[1:18:37] the door knocking he's in the church
[1:18:38] he's in the believer it was a revelation
[1:18:42] of the Son of Man they went they put out
[1:18:44] they put him out of the door but he said
[1:18:49] can I come back in what a gentleman can
[1:18:54] I come back in because when you bring
[1:18:56] somebody into your house you've welcomed
[1:18:58] them there and you make them a part of
[1:19:01] the house and a part of your fellowship
[1:19:05] that's the whole part the Son of Man was
[1:19:08] what was drove from the church that was
[1:19:09] the son of man standing in that
[1:19:11] revelations behold ah
[1:19:15] can I interpolate behold i the son of
[1:19:18] man Stan
[1:19:19] at the door because it's a human being
[1:19:21] knocking remember what brother Graham
[1:19:23] said in Revelations 5 he said that had
[1:19:25] to be a human that took the book he said
[1:19:28] a lamb can't take a book he said it had
[1:19:31] to be a human that was this bloody son
[1:19:34] of man that took that book see that we
[1:19:36] can go on another Avenue with the Son of
[1:19:38] Man the Son of Man is what took the book
[1:19:42] hello
[1:19:44] bleeding bloody man took the book that
[1:19:48] was the son of man because he's your is
[1:19:50] your intercessor the Internet only one
[1:19:55] intercessor between God and man and
[1:19:57] that's the man Christ Jesus why the man
[1:19:59] Christ Jesus so who is this son of man
[1:20:03] he's now back in his church we have
[1:20:08] opened the door somebody broke the seal
[1:20:14] and laid him in somebody somebody broke
[1:20:21] that seal and let that son of man back
[1:20:24] in the door because he's back in his
[1:20:27] church he's right here
[1:20:35] well I may not admit nothing to you but
[1:20:37] it did to me then he waited till the
[1:20:41] very end time when they throwed him out
[1:20:43] of the church because remember when we
[1:20:50] get to that Seventh Seal that's the end
[1:20:53] of all things what ended what ended
[1:20:57] Christ's earthly journey he died well I
[1:21:06] said you hear me what ended Christ's
[1:21:08] earthly journey he died
[1:21:11] and he came back as the son of God that
[1:21:16] son of man was hid now sure John turns
[1:21:20] and looks and sees one like unto the Son
[1:21:22] of man you say well that's wrong brother
[1:21:24] Dale brother way that's wrong no it was
[1:21:27] God's bride is feminist God's bride is
[1:21:30] God in human flesh
[1:21:32] even in the fourth church age that was
[1:21:34] God in human flesh but their
[1:21:36] understanding was not that he had
[1:21:40] already been put out of the church but
[1:21:43] God through the Son of God revelation
[1:21:44] gave them just enough to get through
[1:21:46] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:21:48] thou shalt be saved
[1:21:49] amen then the Son of God will come and
[1:21:53] dwell in your heart but that's not in
[1:21:55] your heart
[1:21:58] that's not in your heart you got it in
[1:22:02] your heart down here this is working on
[1:22:06] the second man it's just working on the
[1:22:08] spirit realm of man and when we get
[1:22:12] right up to here of them brother Dale
[1:22:13] gets the worries taught it it's the same
[1:22:15] thing the son of man if listen if the
[1:22:18] son of man was the headstone right here
[1:22:21] and he was rejected then the son of
[1:22:24] man's got to come back as the headstone
[1:22:26] in the end time saying son of man to be
[1:22:29] accepted open the door and let him in
[1:22:33] let's stand our feet open the door and
[1:22:38] let him in you know I don't feel sorry
[1:22:47] for the people back in the other ages
[1:22:50] that's what we built everything on they
[1:22:52] just didn't have enough revelation they
[1:22:55] didn't have enough revelation to believe
[1:22:57] that that was God that they were God in
[1:23:00] human flesh and then Lord of mercy when
[1:23:05] the denominations come along made him
[1:23:08] three come on made him three made him
[1:23:12] false baptism
[1:23:14] thank you brother made him help me in
[1:23:17] eternal scaring people what they do they
[1:23:20] put that son of man outside the door and
[1:23:23] they said no we'll take that but this is
[1:23:26] too strong for us remember this is meat
[1:23:31] you say oh that's me well yeah but this
[1:23:33] is meat this is the Eagle age this is

[1:26:50] it's like brother Dale said it's really
[1:26:52] nice to have healings and and an emotion
[1:26:56] but man let's get excited about this get
[1:27:00] excited that that there there's there's
[1:27:05] a time and a place for all things this
[1:27:09] is the time and this is the place for
[1:27:11] the son of man to not be outside the
[1:27:13] church to be in the church you bring him
[1:27:17] to church and you nurture him and yet
[1:27:20] that is the stature of a perfect man
[1:27:22] that is the stature of the Son of Man
[1:27:25] and man so we get it as we eat we get
[1:27:32] stronger and then one day it's just
[1:27:36] going to materialize folks it's not
[1:27:37] gonna be some great mm-hmm
[1:27:40] my brother Dale said brother mode always
[1:27:41] said it's not you know firemen even in
[1:27:45] their haste our firemen never skipped a
[1:27:48] rung he knows how to he knows how to
[1:27:50] climb that ladder why he ain't comment
[1:27:52] faster because if you jump about three
[1:27:54] rungs up and grab it and you miss you
[1:27:56] might get hurt but they know how to do
[1:27:58] it and that's the way it's been
[1:27:59] happening where that that fireman
[1:28:01] climbing each each level each ladder and
[1:28:04] we don't miss a step we don't miss the
[1:28:07] step we won't get hurt but that last
[1:28:09] step is not this far where all the other
[1:28:12] ones were like this because if you have
[1:28:14] you ever went down the stairs that they
[1:28:16] weren't even
[1:28:18] that's why all steps are supposed to be
[1:28:20] even because your brain is in cadence
[1:28:23] walking down the steps well if you got
[1:28:25] one that's this tall and one it's that's
[1:28:27] tall you're in trouble
[1:28:28] God steps for just nothing they're the
[1:28:30] same this thing this whole thing all
[1:28:33] through life God has brought us to a
[1:28:35] place to where all we do is now is just
[1:28:38] feed on the Word of God
[1:28:39] feed on the Word of God feed on the Word
[1:28:42] of God there's not some magic formula
[1:28:44] that we're going to stir up somewhere in
[1:28:46] the back room and everybody drink it and
[1:28:50] go in the rapture no it's gonna be the
[1:28:52] Word of God but the son of man standing
[1:28:55] at that door
[1:28:56] but when brother Branham preached those
[1:28:58] seals and broke those seals he broke
[1:28:59] that door open I believe and Christ
[1:29:02] walked right into the church and said
[1:29:05] Here I am but you know what the problem
[1:29:08] was they were looking at William Branham
[1:29:13] they were looking at William Branham
[1:29:15] that's why he had to go off the scene he
[1:29:17] must decrease that I may increase what
[1:29:20] Christ increased Christ increased in me
[1:29:23] and you hey man
