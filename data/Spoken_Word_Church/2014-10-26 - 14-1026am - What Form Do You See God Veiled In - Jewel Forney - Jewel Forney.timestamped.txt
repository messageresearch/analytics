[10:00] if you got your bibles this morning i'm
[10:01] gonna go to two places in the scripture
[10:04] romans eight
[10:06] and i'm gonna read from the book of
[10:07] philippians two but i wanna begin
[10:09] reading that romans eight
[10:11] and uh everybody this scripture probably
[10:14] don't been read more than
[10:15] any other scripture you can think of
[10:17] what i'm concerned in the bible
[10:20] romans 8 29
[10:23] to verse 31 i believe it is
[10:26] and it says here
[10:28] for what he did for new he also did
[10:33] predestinate to be conformed to the
[10:35] image
[10:36] of his son
[10:38] that he might be the firstborn among
[10:40] many brothers
[10:42] moreover when he did predestinate to
[10:44] them he also called
[10:46] and whom he called to them he also
[10:49] justified and whom he justified then he
[10:52] also glorified him
[10:54] what shall we
[10:56] what shall
[10:57] we then say to these things
[11:01] if god be for us
[11:03] who can be against us
[11:06] i like this scripture right there to put
[11:07] the devil on the back burner already i
[11:10] mean so the next uh
[11:12] uh philippians 2
[11:15] and i'm going to be starting at verse 5
[11:18] philippians 2 verse 5.
[11:22] and let me find it myself
[11:26] it says here let this mind
[11:31] be in you which also was in christ jesus
[11:36] being uh
[11:38] who being in the form of god thought it
[11:41] not robbery
[11:42] to be equal with god
[11:46] but made himself of no reputation
[11:49] and took upon him the form of a servant
[11:52] and
[11:53] was made in the lightness
[11:56] amen that's a prayer
[11:59] father help me oh god
[12:01] to heal my mind
[12:02] my body my spirit my soul to you this
[12:05] morning god
[12:07] father god help me to catch the mind of
[12:09] christ for this assembly lord
[12:11] now father god i give you all my script
[12:13] lord i give you all my mind body soul
[12:16] and spirit will you please take over in
[12:18] the name of jesus christ we pray
[12:21] amen god bless you you may be seated one
[12:23] moment
[12:27] thank the lord for the reading of the
[12:29] word of god
[12:30] you see brother lewis amen
[12:32] thank the lord for the word of god this
[12:35] morning that we realize here that i like
[12:37] the way paul said it here he said
[12:40] another word of timothy uh of paul
[12:42] saying in philippians say being in the
[12:44] form of god
[12:46] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[12:48] god
[12:49] in other words either way paul was
[12:51] saying in the scripture he thought it
[12:53] not robbery to come to the same
[12:56] revelation that christ walked in
[12:59] hallelujah i had a title this morning
[13:02] i'm going to use this title
[13:04] what form do you see god veiled in
[13:08] it's very important that you know what
[13:11] form you're looking for right hallelujah
[13:13] that way some people say i'm looking for
[13:15] the form of the pillow fire i'm looking
[13:17] for the form of the car but i'm looking
[13:19] for the goddess skin
[13:21] hallelujah that's the form i want to see
[13:23] god in this hour i'm going to use the
[13:24] quotation from the mighty god unveil
[13:28] this is the form we're taking he's
[13:30] taking on his form he said now in
[13:32] ezekiel uh two and verse three he was
[13:35] there speaking to jehovah himself called
[13:38] called an ezekiel
[13:39] prophet son of man
[13:42] did he say son of man means a this is
[13:44] the message the mighty god unveiled page
[13:47] eight he said son of man means a prophet
[13:50] he has to come that way
[13:52] see the people trying to make it come
[13:54] some other way but that is the only
[13:57] interest he got into this life
[13:59] in florida he had to come through a
[14:02] prophet
[14:03] hallelujah if he chained the pattern he
[14:05] break the scripture
[14:06] and he said he has to come that way
[14:09] to do to fulfill due to romans 18 and
[14:12] verse 15 which moses said the lord your
[14:15] god shall raise up raise up among you a
[14:18] prophet like it unto me he never
[14:21] he never called himself the son of god
[14:23] he referred to himself son of man
[14:26] because he had to come according to the
[14:30] scripture i did not according to a human
[14:33] will but according to the scripture
[14:36] if god do something this morning he's
[14:38] still got to come according to the
[14:40] scripture he will never change his
[14:43] coming outside the scripture
[14:45] and he says and see he
[14:48] he has to make himself known
[14:51] those two pieces of
[14:53] uh uh uh those two pieces of torn paper
[14:57] the old testament
[14:59] has
[15:00] had to make those two pieces uh and why
[15:03] i'm ready back read the same thing
[15:04] excuse me
[15:06] yeah the old testament prophecy his own
[15:10] and then we're dealing with his own he
[15:11] pulled it up praise god and he's dealing
[15:13] with his own character
[15:15] to to to be exactly the same so he has
[15:19] he come the son of man
[15:22] it come in that
[15:24] form
[15:25] hallelujah that was the form that god
[15:27] has failed him now i want you to notice
[15:29] here as i begin to look at the word of
[15:31] god as i take this code off
[15:35] one thing i believe boy you can't work
[15:37] and fight with a codom
[15:39] so thank god for that and otherwise it
[15:41] comes in the form of the son of man and
[15:44] the point of it is so we feel like if
[15:46] god comes in a prophet he always got to
[15:49] come that way right right hello bego god
[15:52] can surely do nothing except he revealed
[15:55] himself that way
[15:57] that is scripture for his coming
[15:59] so now we find him we find here that we
[16:02] want to look at him as he begin to come
[16:04] up begin to be paralyzed himself into
[16:07] the form of a man but he had to come to
[16:10] a prophet first
[16:11] hallelujah we find here that i began i
[16:14] took isaiah 61 and then he began to
[16:17] isaiah was a prophet hallelujah and it
[16:19] would israel got the inspiration of god
[16:23] thought in his mind and i thought the
[16:25] word had to be a thought before it could
[16:27] be made flesh i dare say ain't underwear
[16:30] and underwear he began to prophesy a
[16:32] virgin secrecy how did he begin to speak
[16:35] the word of god and did we find here in
[16:37] isaiah 61 he began to tend to that word
[16:41] be made flesh
[16:44] let's look at isaiah 61. isaiah 61 verse
[16:47] 1 i like the way jesus said here what
[16:50] the word god come here he was here here
[16:52] with this prophecy was here and it been
[16:54] it been as they were speaking these
[16:56] things under inspiration son of man he
[16:59] catches the mind of god and he began to
[17:01] speak the word hallelujah in the word so
[17:04] here he was he'd say and when he was
[17:06] speaking that inspiration was on him and
[17:09] it seemed like he was talking about
[17:10] himself but he was clear he was speaking
[17:13] the word of god and god would
[17:14] materialize himself around flesh
[17:18] he says here the spirit of the lord god
[17:22] is upon me
[17:23] because
[17:25] the lord has anointed me to preach
[17:28] good tiding unto the meat
[17:30] he has sent me to bind up the
[17:32] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[17:36] captain
[17:37] and the opening of the prison to them
[17:39] that are bound
[17:41] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[17:43] lord
[17:44] and the day of revenge
[17:47] of our god today to
[17:49] comfort all that moan so i love speaking
[17:52] these words under inspiration but as
[17:54] long as it was right there under the
[17:56] heart and lord that word was right there
[17:59] and it never did nothing never took or
[18:01] never came to pass it was no good it was
[18:04] just been laying down but it had to come
[18:06] to pass and if god spoke it he had to
[18:09] come and fulfill it
[18:11] so whenever released the word god had to
[18:13] materialize himself around that promise
[18:16] hallelujah so we found her and we
[18:18] noticed the story here in the world how
[18:20] did he always come through how he always
[18:22] come through prophecy hallelujah that is
[18:25] this coming how did isaiah
[18:27] i knew he had to come to the fulfillment
[18:29] of that prophecy because the prophet
[18:31] said club modern evictions made clear by
[18:33] prophecy
[18:35] so modern events is made clear about
[18:37] prophecy he had to come according to
[18:39] prophecy
[18:41] so he wouldn't materialize himself and
[18:43] one day a virgin she had to step into
[18:45] prophecy
[18:47] mary was not it was no accident that
[18:49] mary went down to the well there was no
[18:51] accident hey what she was doing that
[18:53] morning it was according to prophecy
[18:57] she had to be the one
[18:59] it could nobody even fulfill her place
[19:02] nobody could take your place
[19:04] how do god know who he is they know
[19:06] where you come from
[19:07] and nobody can take your place how did
[19:09] so mary had to be the she had to be the
[19:12] virgin
[19:13] i know a lot of times
[19:15] we don't find over the years people get
[19:17] worked up in their minds
[19:19] and now they'll come up and they'll say
[19:21] a statement like this
[19:23] i got pregnant and i didn't know no man
[19:25] if they tell you that they automatically
[19:26] tell you a lot right
[19:29] they tell you a lot that ain't going to
[19:31] happen but once
[19:32] that ain't going to happen but one time
[19:33] ain't now nothing tell me that what
[19:35] happened since that time right
[19:36] hallelujah a little worse if that didn't
[19:38] work we cannot believe a lie like that i
[19:40] don't care how much they speaking to us
[19:42] how holy look underworld anymore one man
[19:44] come that way and that was the man
[19:46] christ jesus however another man could
[19:48] have come that way then it could have
[19:50] been another land worthy to take the
[19:51] book but it wasn't but one man that was
[19:54] worthy to take the book and that was the
[19:55] man that come without sex desire how do
[19:57] you know a man that come by the spoken
[19:59] word prophecy of the word that's right
[20:01] hello
[20:02] so mary came down that morning how did
[20:05] mary identify him she you know what she
[20:07] might not have realized but she was
[20:09] standing in isaiah prophecy
[20:11] right mary was walking in isaiah privacy
[20:14] a verdict she could see hallelujah she
[20:16] would have knew her plan she couldn't
[20:18] say this day isaiah prophecy fulfilled
[20:21] how did she was standing in the prophecy
[20:23] for that hour
[20:24] and all of a sudden she had to believe
[20:26] it
[20:29] see the point of it is today is getting
[20:31] people to believe
[20:32] how do you know to get the people to
[20:34] believe america just was going to be uh
[20:36] operated by faith
[20:38] hallelujah in other words another word
[20:40] anyway we always talk about the evidence
[20:42] of the holy ghost and won't believe a
[20:44] promise
[20:45] holy everywhere the very evidence of the
[20:47] holy ghost feed off the promises
[20:49] hallelujah show the evidence of the holy
[20:50] ghost and the word did the prophet god
[20:52] use the message in the future on page 26
[20:55] and he began to talk about the evidence
[20:57] said the holy ghost mary had to come to
[21:00] a clear understanding of what she was
[21:02] doing
[21:04] god don't never take us by surprise
[21:06] about accident we got a clear
[21:08] understanding where we come from we got
[21:10] a clear understanding where we're going
[21:12] from how to go until we realize if we
[21:14] got a clear understanding if i'm coming
[21:16] from god i'm going back to god holy
[21:19] ain't no devil hell to stop your destiny
[21:21] holy should he go down here he uses the
[21:23] quotation in the future he said now what
[21:26] we what what we are
[21:28] talking and
[21:29] tell talking the other day the evidence
[21:32] of the lord he goes see the evidence
[21:35] of the holy ghost is when you can
[21:37] receive the word not some system
[21:40] but have a clear
[21:42] understanding
[21:44] how do you know that word is a clear
[21:47] understanding clear understanding it
[21:50] watch it vindicate itself then you know
[21:53] you are in the scripture and once you
[21:56] see the word come to pass you see your
[21:58] position in the scripture
[22:01] people don't want to tell you right now
[22:03] until you meet that word made flesh
[22:05] until it becomes anywhere this word can
[22:07] not just see you you just not should
[22:09] never walk around all your life with a
[22:11] book in your hand that ain't gonna do
[22:12] you no good when you fight the devil you
[22:14] gotta get the book in your heart so when
[22:16] you speak the word you become a little
[22:18] voice
[22:21] to mary here she's come here she became
[22:24] that prophecy anyway she met she stepped
[22:26] in isaiah prophecy holly what did she do
[22:29] she had to have a clear understanding
[22:32] she could not be in the spirit of
[22:34] confusion because the holy ghost is not
[22:35] a
[22:36] confusion
[22:37] there's a presence of almighty god
[22:39] breaking in on mary like that it throwed
[22:41] her into whoa
[22:43] man would you explain it never happened
[22:45] before
[22:46] here she was standing there a the man a
[22:49] gabriel standing there with a message
[22:51] from the king
[22:53] holly mary mary you have been highly
[22:55] favored
[22:56] hallelujah you have been highly
[22:58] favorable among women hallelujah mary
[23:00] and you shall receive a son and born of
[23:03] the holy ghost mary thank you be there
[23:05] oh my lord
[23:06] wait a minute holy holy holy
[23:08] we don't get ahead of the program
[23:10] i ain't got married yet and i don't even
[23:12] know a man
[23:13] hallelujah so she put it back on human
[23:15] ability to produce a child she put it
[23:18] about the way human but reproduction to
[23:20] bring forth a child she said i don't
[23:22] even know a man that she knew that was a
[23:24] that was the logical that was the way
[23:25] that life comes but god said no mary not
[23:28] just time this is the seal's been opened
[23:31] this ain't got nothing to do with man
[23:33] hollywood they tell mary hit mary said i
[23:35] don't understand it then he had to go
[23:37] and break a seal right right he goes way
[23:40] back
[23:41] and he goes say mary
[23:42] i see right now you're not catching what
[23:44] i'm saying
[23:45] you remember the last time you died
[23:47] cousin elizabeth she was all humped over
[23:50] and uncle and uncle and unconscious
[23:53] how they were walking around that
[23:54] brother could get around hallelujah
[23:56] couldn't hardly get to the anyway that's
[23:58] what mary would remember she remember
[24:00] looking at a cousin a little bit and uh
[24:03] because of zachariah how they were
[24:05] getting old in the old days
[24:07] but he said mary i want to let you know
[24:10] right now he said oh god tell you an
[24:12] elizabeth in her old lady have already
[24:16] received a baby how do we marry cena see
[24:19] that ain't nothing too hard for god
[24:21] it ain't meant to hurt your fault of god
[24:23] if god could bring a baby out of
[24:25] elizabeth holy how much more being under
[24:28] me according to that word god
[24:33] she brought through prophecy
[24:35] hallelujah john had to be on earth
[24:38] before jesus could come
[24:40] because the prophet had always
[24:41] forerunned the word
[24:42] so you cannot break the order of the
[24:44] scripture how little john had you know
[24:46] where
[24:47] the bible said john and she had carried
[24:49] this baby
[24:51] she had had this baby in her womb six
[24:53] months i think it was
[24:55] and had no revival right hallelujah
[24:57] there was no thunder to wake john up
[24:59] hallelujah another way you could have
[25:01] the first sixth seal and not be in the
[25:03] revelation of the word i'll leave the
[25:05] first six seals and not him himself but
[25:07] when she everywhere so she had not had a
[25:09] revival and since it's six churches but
[25:12] mary came yeah how did it carry the
[25:15] world of life
[25:17] and when she greeted jim a little boy
[25:19] and spoke his name and whatever she done
[25:22] john leaped in her womb for joy when it
[25:24] was the word spoke life
[25:27] the word bring life
[25:29] and life was in the body
[25:31] she was carrying the word of life in her
[25:33] body and she said jesus and every devil
[25:37] in hell know their name
[25:44] so now jesus we find him he'll go
[25:46] prophecy now we we were dealing with
[25:48] prophecy this morning so jesus had to
[25:50] find himself
[25:53] he had to find himself
[25:55] it was good to say he was the messiah
[25:57] but it was another thing to find himself
[25:59] in the scripture
[26:00] now we find a lot of history
[26:03] it didn't record a lot of things in his
[26:05] life
[26:06] we had a few events that it took place
[26:07] when he was younger
[26:09] one was he was in the temple teaching
[26:10] when he was 12 years old
[26:12] how did we remember that
[26:14] and then and we remember a couple of
[26:15] little things that happened in his in
[26:17] his life when he was you went real small
[26:19] it does not really say a lot about jesus
[26:22] life
[26:23] when he was uh when he was small
[26:25] only on the referee we got on a few
[26:28] things that he did when brother
[26:29] peregrine goes down in egypt
[26:33] and pulls up the old manuscripts
[26:35] and one of the manuscripts was telling
[26:37] about jesus when he was a baby
[26:39] hallelujah another word that because he
[26:41] was dealing with when mary you remember
[26:43] when he goes into the wedding the
[26:45] wedding fish
[26:46] mary told those disciples whatever he
[26:49] tell you you just do it
[26:51] honey don't you try to question it just
[26:54] do it right why mary had to have an
[26:56] experience that this son had power and
[26:59] he was supernatural
[27:01] so you know so she goes here and i was
[27:03] looking at brother read a manuscript
[27:04] years ago and it really hit me mary in
[27:07] other words if he said he said what
[27:09] happened was the reason mary faith was
[27:11] built to the way it was when jesus was a
[27:14] little bitty baby holly mary was sitting
[27:16] on
[27:17] some corner somewhere and she had a
[27:19] bucket of water uh uh uh either a pan or
[27:22] water whatever and she was washing jesus
[27:25] and she was cleaning him up i didn't
[27:27] know the old man sitting there with a
[27:28] wizard on him and so when mary got
[27:31] through washing jesus she slid the
[27:32] bucket over there and this man sitting
[27:34] at the wizard oh he reached down and
[27:36] touched the water and his hand grew out
[27:38] straight mary said that got to be a god
[27:41] man
[27:42] why didn't we tell you you just do it
[27:44] right holy i want to tell you this
[27:46] morning why don't we tell you just do it
[27:48] don't question god don't question faith
[27:51] he said it he promised it and he'll
[27:53] stand behind it
[27:56] to be valuable though jesus must
[27:58] identify himself
[28:00] it was time for prophecy to be fulfilled
[28:02] the word had to be in flesh hallelujah
[28:04] ordered to take this part of the book
[28:07] so now he ought to fulfill the port
[28:09] concerning himself how what do we do he
[28:11] goes in here to the book of saint luke
[28:15] say luke the saint luke the fourth
[28:18] chapter
[28:19] and i want to begin
[28:21] at the verse 18 just the same time
[28:24] say luke
[28:25] the fourth chapter and verse 18
[28:29] 2 21 here he goes he goes until we know
[28:32] the story goes into the temple and that
[28:34] way and they handed him a scroll
[28:37] and what jesus began to say he began to
[28:40] take the scripture
[28:41] he began to say i am standing in isaiah
[28:45] prophecy
[28:47] nobody was trying to let the people i am
[28:49] standing in isaiah prophecy hallelujah
[28:52] so he said now if you notice here he was
[28:55] going back to something being preached
[28:57] 800 years ago
[28:59] he was if modern event was made clear
[29:02] the word and the body becoming one
[29:05] he says here
[29:07] the spirit
[29:09] of the
[29:10] lord is upon me
[29:14] i was the greatest anointing that would
[29:15] hit the earth right how did the greatest
[29:18] anointing hit the earth you said well
[29:19] that's shouting and running out no the
[29:21] greatest anointing has been able to find
[29:22] yourself in the word
[29:24] because you find people that just shout
[29:26] run holly shout all over the
[29:28] building but they don't know their
[29:29] position in the world and when the
[29:31] storms come and the trials come they
[29:33] move off and run their faith how do they
[29:35] leave the church where they do they
[29:36] don't know their position right
[29:38] hallelujah he said the spirit of the
[29:40] lord god is upon me
[29:43] because he has anointed me
[29:45] to preach the gospel
[29:49] not only him every preacher that's
[29:52] called by the holy ghost is under the
[29:53] same covenant
[29:55] you got to be anointed by him to preach
[29:56] the gospel hallelujah that's the only
[29:58] way you could be
[29:59] hallelujah
[30:01] gospel don't come by intellectual
[30:03] training how did we got many preachers
[30:05] that went to school and became
[30:07] intellectual teachers of the scripture
[30:09] and what do they teach the people they
[30:10] don't teach the people to get closer to
[30:12] god they teach them away from god
[30:14] because you got to be anointed by god to
[30:16] preach the word
[30:18] says he says here he says he'd have
[30:21] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[30:24] poor
[30:26] he has sent me
[30:28] to heal the brokenhearted
[30:31] to proclaim liberty to the captive
[30:33] and the recovering of sight to them
[30:36] to the blind
[30:38] to set it liberally to them that are
[30:40] bruised
[30:41] to preach the acceptable year
[30:44] of the lord
[30:45] this way he was he now it's something
[30:48] taking place here because when you start
[30:49] to read a scripture i read the whole
[30:51] scripture
[30:52] when i read isaiah 61 i didn't stop
[30:54] right there in the second verse and just
[30:56] stop i read the whole thing out when
[30:59] jesus got to this point he stopped right
[31:01] in the right before he completed the
[31:03] second verse and it though the people
[31:05] because when somebody do this you think
[31:06] why didn't finish
[31:08] everybody look at him while he didn't
[31:10] finish the scripture
[31:12] he did finish the scripture he fulfilled
[31:14] the part that was concerning him in
[31:16] prophecy he was no need to read the rest
[31:19] of it that was not his part right
[31:21] hallelujah he was playing at the
[31:23] sympathy
[31:25] right so he didn't end the word then
[31:27] they closed in the book
[31:28] he closed the book right there i knew he
[31:30] was the one that could close and open it
[31:32] so he called the book right there and
[31:34] then he the bible said and then him and
[31:36] when he closed the book
[31:38] he gave it again to the ministers
[31:41] and he sat down
[31:44] and the eyes of all them were
[31:47] in the synagogue were fastened on him
[31:50] right they were sitting in a in a state
[31:52] of
[31:53] what did he why he didn't finish reading
[31:55] this
[31:56] why he called the book and just give it
[31:58] back he didn't even read the rest of it
[32:00] how did he read the part that was
[32:01] concerning him
[32:03] then he goes in here to every eye was up
[32:04] on him in the synagogue and then then he
[32:07] sat down and he and he began to say unto
[32:11] them
[32:12] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[32:17] your ears i mean what was he talking to
[32:19] he was talking to the sheep
[32:21] right i wanted to seek your heart
[32:24] certainly don't have ears
[32:26] so he was speaking to all the elections
[32:28] right there how did this day this
[32:29] scripture it fulfilled in your ear he
[32:31] was talking to the legacy blessing all
[32:34] your ears all right for we know the time
[32:36] that we live in
[32:37] prophecy holy we fire so he always
[32:40] take the prophecy concerning him and we
[32:42] noticed right here and we noticed it
[32:44] here we go he knew what jesus life was
[32:47] built around prophecy
[32:49] his death he went to hell
[32:52] on a prophecy of one man they committed
[32:54] adultery
[32:57] now you know we're going to go to hell
[33:00] you're going to die you want to make
[33:01] sure you got a man
[33:02] that you don't got nothing in his life
[33:05] but jesus was not looking at his body
[33:07] he was looking at the soul that was in
[33:09] david because david said lord i hear
[33:11] that word in my heart that i don't sin
[33:13] against you my body might have made a
[33:14] mistake but i didn't do it in the first
[33:16] place i didn't know what he was looking
[33:18] at anyway he was looking at the prophecy
[33:20] he was looking at the position he called
[33:22] david and david stepped in the spirit of
[33:24] prophecy and he prophesied
[33:26] anyway hey look at my i didn't know
[33:28] where my balls in my and he began to
[33:31] promise about his bones and how did he
[33:33] another way he began to speak of death
[33:36] and jesus what the hell
[33:39] a one-man
[33:40] prophecy amen david prophesied how death
[33:44] would be
[33:45] right and jesus took that scripture
[33:47] along and he went down and faced satan
[33:49] with him
[33:50] on one man prophecy
[33:52] but by one man prophecy it brought his
[33:55] body out of the grave one man probably
[33:57] put him in the grave one man prophecy
[33:59] brought him out of the grave and that
[34:01] what job said hallelujah don't he scared
[34:04] word destroy my flesh but in my flood i
[34:07] shall see jesus he recognized his body
[34:10] he's seen the resurrection
[34:12] one man probably put him in the grain
[34:14] and one man probably brought him out of
[34:16] the grave that's why he's standing on
[34:18] myself tonight this morning
[34:20] hallelujah prophecy
[34:22] find him we find that these other guys
[34:27] coming from the book of emails
[34:29] the reason they was confused
[34:32] confusion is when you don't know your
[34:34] place in the scripture
[34:36] hallelujah in other words i know i know
[34:38] we in with the message here but brother
[34:39] brandon said i preach the bible
[34:41] and then when people trying to try and
[34:43] approve a quote without the bible it
[34:44] don't work
[34:46] brother brandon proved to quote his
[34:48] bible wasn't his absolute
[34:50] how do you know what he said if i say
[34:51] something the bible doesn't go back to
[34:52] the word right i'll leave it under the
[34:54] word so you know where anyway so we
[34:56] realized that the brother brother had a
[34:57] respect for god's word
[34:59] and proven paul had a respect for the
[35:01] word
[35:02] how do we everyone shall we begin to go
[35:04] in here and we find here that from the
[35:06] road emails so guys was not in prophecy
[35:11] they was in the flesh
[35:13] and it was
[35:14] you know because it was in the flesh
[35:16] all they could see was the death
[35:18] all they had to look at job they would
[35:20] saw the resurrection
[35:21] how they were they were looking at the
[35:22] death where they everybody was where and
[35:24] they were they were looking at the devil
[35:26] here and here they were going down the
[35:27] road they was all sad and they were beat
[35:30] down and they all they was all on the
[35:32] depression here they were going down
[35:34] here why was he while they were
[35:37] oh my god my how they doing to my lord
[35:40] all they could see was
[35:42] hallelujah jesus good and the bible said
[35:45] what it was he steps out in a glorified
[35:47] body how to a young body 18 years old or
[35:51] 20 years old that they never had contact
[35:53] with right right
[35:55] amen
[35:57] it's all right to remember brother sam
[36:00] you know it's good you can remember
[36:01] brother sam hallelujah you know you and
[36:04] and and you know in our minds here we
[36:06] wouldn't have a picture and never saw
[36:08] him when he was a young boy we just look
[36:10] at him
[36:11] i remember brother sam that is the way
[36:13] you're going to see brother sam
[36:15] hallelujah because that's all you ever
[36:16] saw him you saw him in that body his
[36:19] older guys however's gray and everything
[36:21] and that's where you remember brother
[36:23] sam and then you see him that way that's
[36:26] the way you're going to look and that's
[36:27] the way he's in your mind that was the
[36:28] seed had been planted in your mind that
[36:30] brother said but if i turn if i never
[36:32] saw brother sam as a young man and he
[36:35] looked like brother zach yeah yeah so
[36:37] then now when i see if he'd come out of
[36:39] his brother's eye i wouldn't be able to
[36:41] look at him and tell if this brother sam
[36:44] or not because now he's in a young body
[36:47] and when anyway when he stepped out in
[36:49] this body they could not recognize the
[36:51] body
[36:52] because you don't accept christ by sight
[36:55] you're accepted by faith they come by
[36:57] hearing the word
[36:58] the word of prophecy is what opened the
[37:00] eyes hallelujah so he goes out here he
[37:02] steps into this dimension stepping into
[37:04] the body
[37:06] not into a theology
[37:08] this is a body that you can touch
[37:10] a body that you can feel he didn't go
[37:12] down to he didn't go when he come back
[37:14] up he out of the out of the tomb he
[37:16] didn't leave the body in the grave he
[37:18] picked that body up chained the elements
[37:20] like he did in the day of abraham and
[37:22] walked out right
[37:23] and he walked down the road with him
[37:26] and he began to quote scripture to him
[37:28] because he was concerned and if you
[37:29] don't know the scripture you won't know
[37:30] what i'm here for how so he if you
[37:33] notice he goes back to the scripture
[37:35] starting with the man's seed moses
[37:37] he says here
[37:40] old food the flow of heart
[37:43] that believe all
[37:45] that the prophets had said right
[37:48] concerning me
[37:49] because he realized the prophecy was
[37:52] coming through prophets so you're
[37:53] pointing him back if you would have
[37:55] stayed with the prophets you would have
[37:56] knew what i'm here to do you would have
[37:58] been in the scripture anyway did he
[38:01] begin to rebuke because they didn't stay
[38:02] with what the prophet was saying they
[38:04] began to try to take their seminary idea
[38:06] or something what somebody else said oh
[38:08] it don't matter what nobody else said
[38:09] they're gonna be a revelation according
[38:11] to the word of god i don't care how many
[38:13] churches don't believe that but i
[38:14] believe in the changing of the body
[38:18] he's the old food slow of heart then he
[38:20] texts the scriptures concerning himself
[38:23] and revealed himself to them right and
[38:25] then here they would it was all whoa
[38:27] whoa we never hear nobody open the word
[38:29] like that
[38:30] hallelujah ain't never heard nobody do
[38:32] this the bible says here there's a
[38:33] little flame probably flicking in their
[38:35] heart
[38:36] at evening time
[38:39] the evening time
[38:41] the cheap meal of the day

[39:54] gotta get ugly how do you if you got a
[39:56] big old barbecue rim you can't sit there
[39:58] with a big barbecue ribs
[40:01] all right now you just you might roll
[40:03] your sleeves up
[40:05] put your apron on and get ugly holly
[40:07] that's the only way you're gonna enjoy
[40:08] the ribs one time i was eating a i went
[40:11] out with a family and they were they
[40:12] kept me to a place you eat lobsters or
[40:14] not lobsters or
[40:16] crabs crab legs and uh and their words
[40:19] and here they were they brought a big
[40:20] plate of crab leg and i'm sitting there
[40:22] thinking
[40:25] trying to keep it
[40:26] and this girl looked at me she was
[40:28] eating
[40:29] she said
[40:30] what you could eat like a sis and eat
[40:32] like a man
[40:35] she gave me a complex
[40:38] i said i can't believe this girl just
[40:40] rebuked me won't you eat like a man to
[40:42] quit eating like a how did he say
[40:44] that i told my
[40:48] the cheat meal the other day
[40:50] they called jesus in at the chief at the
[40:52] evening time
[40:54] and that's when he brought he goes into
[40:56] the place with them
[40:58] in the chief mail
[40:59] and it says here
[41:01] he goes this guest this is our guest
[41:04] normally when you have a guest the most
[41:06] hospitable thing to do is have him to
[41:08] either bless the table
[41:10] you know he always normally guess get
[41:13] uh
[41:14] you know you got to guess that i know
[41:15] what you people thinking every time i'm
[41:17] preaching can we get to eat first
[41:21] back mama
[41:23] but gibbs told me that when they was
[41:24] young the preachers got to eat first
[41:26] they got all the good chicken and got
[41:28] the
[41:28] chicken feet
[41:30] the kids got the chicken feet i said man
[41:32] don't give me no chicken feet that's the
[41:34] only thing i don't eat on chicken and
[41:35] feeds
[41:37] too many other parts you can eat outside
[41:39] the feast
[41:40] hallelujah anyway he said but you know
[41:42] but here they were they gave jesus the
[41:43] guest on break the bread
[41:46] jesus knew this was going to open the
[41:47] eyes
[41:49] because this was probably they're going
[41:50] to remember something that he always
[41:52] done
[41:52] something that they seen him do time at
[41:54] the time at the time he broke the bread
[41:57] a certain way he could break the bread
[41:59] he kept giving it out and he kept giving
[42:01] it out and they noticed the bread was
[42:03] not consumed
[42:04] how then they began to realize oh no
[42:07] their eyes come open
[42:09] and they knew him
[42:11] but it was not important that they knew
[42:13] him it was important that they know
[42:15] their place in the scripture
[42:17] hey jesus did not leave him now with the
[42:19] eyes open looking at him he opened the
[42:21] eyes to the scripture because he know
[42:23] after he leaves they got to be in the
[42:25] word to find their place
[42:29] god bless you brother just stop there
[42:31] praise the lord we're dealing with a
[42:36] heaven
[42:37] amen sorry i'm dealing with a little
[42:40] break on what form do we see god failed
[42:42] in dealing with prophecy so now we fight
[42:44] here so jesus said we find that jesus
[42:46] did anything and he made himself known
[42:48] by prophecy he never changed his pattern
[42:51] and that's the way he got why he left
[42:53] him with the scripture
[42:55] if you notice he said he opened their
[42:57] eyes they knew him
[42:59] and then he realized okay this anyone
[43:01] left them in that point all they would
[43:03] have stayed right there in that spot
[43:05] right
[43:06] but he opened their understanding
[43:09] that they may understand the scripture
[43:12] because he know after his resurrection
[43:14] after he'd be sent back he gonna pick up
[43:17] the same order that he gave moses the
[43:19] lord him god should do nothing
[43:21] right he would never change that order
[43:24] right now
[43:25] that were the people that misguided
[43:27] he don't never change that order
[43:30] the lord your god would raise up a
[43:31] prophet liking unto me
[43:33] so now let us get here i'm going to deal
[43:35] this in him
[43:37] because now we realize here so he leaves
[43:39] he sends back his spirit according to
[43:42] the prophecy of joel
[43:44] that was prophecy
[43:46] that was not no accident that people got
[43:48] excited like that how this shoots the
[43:49] scene
[43:50] since the screen revival was only the
[43:52] prophecy how i poured my spirit right on
[43:55] your sons and your daughters and they
[43:58] shall prophesy it it had to come to pass
[44:02] they were standing in prophecy when this
[44:04] took place
[44:05] in other words so we remember god when
[44:07] he did this uh outpouring of the spirit
[44:09] right here they maybe people begin to to
[44:12] get called up and seeing them the power
[44:14] of god moving through the church
[44:15] prophecies taking place things taken
[44:17] place people's getting heavy speaking in
[44:19] tongues that was good that was his day
[44:22] but it was bringing us to something
[44:25] it was bringing into something because
[44:27] he was it had to be
[44:29] according to the scripture for us to
[44:31] understand what we ain't it had to be a
[44:33] prophecy
[44:35] because that was dave's mistress
[44:38] jesus never opened the last boy
[44:40] he said i didn't preach the you know the
[44:41] claim the liberty and you know and all
[44:43] that he never preached that part so
[44:44] something still was sealed because he
[44:45] closed the book he didn't say nothing
[44:47] about it
[44:48] so that was something else to come
[44:49] healthy so we we're standing in prophecy
[44:51] so now it goes all the way over here so
[44:53] we got we we must find our day and time
[44:56] now all of a sudden according to
[44:58] prophecy you know he said a grain of
[45:00] wheat must go into the ground a greater
[45:02] we had to fall into the ground that
[45:04] great rail fell into the ground but if
[45:06] it lay if it don't go into the ground it
[45:08] abides alone holy that won't be no
[45:10] revival but if it go into the ground and
[45:13] pray for many fruits
[45:16] one corn
[45:17] on the day of pentagon brought the three
[45:19] thousand believers
[45:22] what are they doing that corn is
[45:24] beginning to bring more corn how they
[45:26] sure he had to go in the ground so he
[45:28] went in the ground through the darkness
[45:30] of justification where's the saints
[45:31] forget
[45:32] on up to come on to our day all right
[45:34] and that they did at the evening time
[45:36] before they do what they're going to go
[45:37] back into the grain again i'm back into
[45:39] the seed again holy what is the seeds
[45:41] how it's time to go to the rapture right
[45:43] right how did prophecy have put us all
[45:45] the way through history until the coming
[45:47] of the lord and rapture form right
[45:50] people if you're looking for something
[45:51] else to happen you don't miss the whole
[45:53] real revelation what he come to do
[45:55] revelation couldn't do not you just come
[45:57] to stir it jesus
[45:58] why are you standing here again
[46:02] there ain't no prayer you better be
[46:03] looking at it downhill you better be
[46:05] looking at now you don't need to be
[46:06] looking up for him to come you better be
[46:08] looking in here on the inside now
[46:12] so i'm going to deal with so here you go
[46:14] he goes down so now we see all the
[46:16] events taking place by prophecy okay he
[46:19] coming up through the edges so now he
[46:21] got he got to manifest himself again in
[46:23] prophetic form hallelujah according to
[46:25] prophecy amen three and seven surely the
[46:27] lord that god would do nothing except he
[46:29] revealed his secrets to the servants of
[46:30] the prophet according to malachi 4 he
[46:33] would come after the order he if you go
[46:34] back to malachi 4 if you notice in
[46:36] malachi 4 he takes them back and he
[46:39] opened the understanding to what he
[46:41] opened his understanding and his first
[46:43] coming all right let's go to malachi 4.
[46:45] right yeah
[46:47] malachi the fourth chapter
[46:50] people don't want to tell you this
[46:52] this did not come
[46:54] has come by the open holy ghost
[46:56] hallelujah you say brother jewel you say
[46:58] how you know i've seen it by the holy
[46:59] ghost right not by mental conception but
[47:02] by what god revealed hallelujah i want
[47:04] you to notice here when jesus come out
[47:05] of the resurrection if you notice his
[47:07] brother and he brought your brother as
[47:09] soon as he come out and stepped out of
[47:10] the glorified bloody on the way to
[47:12] emmaus
[47:13] he says he goes back and he says
[47:17] he take those fools and slow hard to
[47:20] remember all that the prophet said did
[47:22] he take the scripture concerning moses
[47:24] and begin to bring it up right so when
[47:26] he goes right here and then where he
[47:27] goes into malachi malachi the fourth
[47:30] chapter let me try to say what verse i'm
[47:31] trying to get to hallelujah let me find
[47:33] my place in here
[47:34] and and in verse four malachi the fourth
[47:38] chapter wait a minute
[47:40] yeah verse four and it says here if you
[47:43] notice right here what did he do he goes
[47:46] and do the same thing right he did when
[47:48] he come out of the grave holly on the
[47:51] road ebayers he's a remember who yeah
[47:56] he goes back probably because it's the
[47:58] resurrection of his second coming of
[48:00] christ
[48:02] he's taking on the same voice that he
[48:04] had there
[48:05] remember
[48:07] the laws of moses my word
[48:11] and and i command him in what hearing
[48:14] what the word is
[48:16] it for all israel with the statues of
[48:18] judgment so then i didn't go he takes
[48:21] the scripture and he fulfilling what he
[48:24] left off right how did he go with the
[48:26] day of revenge he never preached but
[48:27] when he take this scripture
[48:29] it goes right into the judgment right
[48:32] hallelujah did he say behold
[48:34] hallelujah did he go right to the
[48:36] prophet behold
[48:38] i was saying unto you elijah not son of
[48:41] god right right but son of man
[48:44] he's coming back in prophetic form again
[48:47] elijah shall we send unto you elijah the
[48:50] prophet
[48:51] before the coming
[48:52] and great and dreadful day of the lord
[48:55] hallelujah and he
[48:57] shall turn the horse of the fathers to
[49:00] the churches hallelujah and the churches
[49:03] to to their father lest i come and smack
[49:06] the earth with a curse what are you

[49:11] adam had already done
[49:13] when they when they fell when he even
[49:15] had them failed for adam's sake the
[49:17] ground was current but i'm coming to
[49:18] turn him back if i don't either
[49:23] holly the car's got to be left
[49:26] that's why we got to go back to restored
[49:28] eating right how
[49:39] so we're right there
[49:41] so now we find her
[49:42] the question i'm trying to get to
[49:44] this is the question is
[49:47] why is the people falling away now
[49:50] why all of a sudden
[49:52] it's been a great falling away
[49:55] from all this truth
[49:57] lord your jew what can we do to stop it

[50:03] ghost hallelujah that's what you're
[50:05] blaming your revelation is today
[50:07] hallelujah if you ain't got the holy
[50:08] ghost why because this is the edge

[50:17] that peoples have been blinded
[50:20] go out west yeah yeah i wish and uh
[50:23] brother ben you believe the message
[50:25] that's right i ain't going to go that

[50:28] the message but i'm talking about i
[50:29] don't been to arizona or one-third of
[50:31] the arizona area believes in brother
[50:33] brandon gonna come back
[50:35] set up a tent and get an airplane the
[50:37] airplane is so out of date
[50:46] and why would he need a tent when jesus
[50:48] come in he'll go cholesterol glory five
[50:50] bodies he didn't need a tent he just
[50:52] stepped right through the door
[50:53] hallelujah
[50:55] he didn't need a tent to get away going
[50:56] when philip got so called up he didn't
[50:58] need a tent he didn't translate him over
[51:00] there
[51:01] jeremy why would he need a tip
[51:06] well people get but the point of it is
[51:09] prophecy that's right bro
[51:11] they won't even need an airplane
[51:13] harley we won't need our plane to get
[51:14] off the earth
[51:16] hallelujah won't be able to hold the
[51:18] third pool harley has the same mission
[51:20] in the caterpillar lays in you right how
[51:23] do the more you eat that word the more
[51:24] you terrorize the body around that seed
[51:29] but look here five people was mixed up
[51:32] my brother brandon become god because
[51:34] they could not discern the prophecy
[51:37] from the prophet right
[51:38] hallelujah they said that's it anyway
[51:40] you remember john come on the earth
[51:43] that says they bowed to him
[51:46] oh you're the messiah
[51:48] they wanted to worship him
[51:50] but john did not get him to look at him
[51:53] he put him in prophecy
[51:55] i am the voice
[51:57] of one crime in the wilderness he
[52:00] pointed them back outside
[52:02] he knew what his position was in the
[52:04] world
[52:06] and the people that they got caught up
[52:08] in these spirits that said
[52:09] we need to pray for them
[52:11] because they ain't not found themselves
[52:13] they're looking at the prophet said of
[52:14] the prophecy
[52:15] so they got the revelation mixed up they
[52:18] looking for brother brandon come back
[52:19] and do something when they should be
[52:20] looking at prophecy is already doing it
[52:22] hallelujah show your deals he goes on
[52:24] here and let me go to revelation 10.

[57:02] righteousness your righteousness as a
[57:04] filthy ragged gossip only when you have
[57:06] righteous you got to come to him he got
[57:08] to come to you it's got to be through
[57:10] his blood not through the whole through
[57:12] the blood all right
[57:14] then he says here
[57:16] that's why he could not preach the seals
[57:17] until he preached a breach right because
[57:20] see if he would have preached the seals
[57:22] before he preached a breach of
[57:23] righteousness
[57:24] would not be holy enough
[57:26] to go behind the veil
[57:28] but right before he preached the seals
[57:29] he preached a breach and the breach
[57:31] brought bleach and what he did he gave
[57:33] you wash you it cleared it up so we
[57:36] could go into the king james i did what
[57:38] he ain't out we are in the chamber now
[57:42] hallelujah right and he said unto me
[57:46] right
[57:47] amen bless us all day let's see can you

[57:54] said blessed all day
[57:56] which are called
[57:58] unto the marriage supper of the lamb
[58:01] he said unto me
[58:03] these are the true sins of god
[58:05] so now
[58:07] the spirit
[58:08] a deity always following the revival
[58:11] spirit of guilty always try to follow
[58:13] man
[58:14] so there's a daily spirit that's going
[58:16] to be so close in this message that
[58:18] you're going to have to take god's
[58:19] spirit and discern that spirit highly or
[58:21] else you could be peeled up because
[58:23] you're gonna begin to look at the vessel
[58:25] and then people begin to look at the
[58:26] vessel and then finally they realize the
[58:28] vessel is a man and they think you know
[58:29] they leave the message right so he goes
[58:31] here he's out fell in his feet to
[58:34] worship him
[58:36] true prophet will never accept worship
[58:38] right true preacher man of god will
[58:40] never accept worship he will never point
[58:43] you to himself he will always point you
[58:45] to the cross
[58:46] he will always point you to the blood
[58:48] and when a man begins to say look at you
[58:49] look at himself remember that is a wrong
[58:52] spirit that is antichrist exactly
[58:55] because god would not share his glory
[58:58] so he said read another word you don't
[59:00] come to church and you say well brother
[59:02] sam he got many mistakes so do you
[59:05] when he gets a new body then he won't
[59:07] have no mistakes
[59:08] but up until then we all got to deal
[59:10] with mistakes
[59:12] so he says here he said and i fell in
[59:14] his feet to worship him and he said unto
[59:16] me
[59:17] say do it not
[59:19] right
[59:20] that was a revelation that hour right
[59:23] that was a revelation that ever paul
[59:25] said no if not i died for you it was not
[59:28] paul's die for you it was christ he
[59:30] always kept him in position with the
[59:31] cross he said if any angel changes let
[59:35] it be a curse
[59:36] even we ourself right we leave this
[59:39] position in the world let us be a curse
[59:41] exactly right hallelujah and he said he
[59:44] said do it not for for i am that fellow
[59:46] servant wanted that brother to have the
[59:48] testimony
[59:50] right of of jesus
[59:52] worship
[59:53] exactly the object of worship no other
[59:55] person you can worship with god how do
[59:57] you worship god for the testimony of
[1:00:00] jesus is the spirit of what
[1:00:02] how do you show the only way you could
[1:00:03] ever see god only way you could see god
[1:00:06] and through the spirit of what
[1:00:09] hallelujah so he put us back now we know
[1:00:11] our position right now
[1:00:13] that's why we can find what day we
[1:00:14] living in
[1:00:16] without knowing prophecy you would not
[1:00:18] know the day you lived in so the prophet
[1:00:20] used a scripture
[1:00:22] i'll use the scripture real quick
[1:00:25] when you go and preach a certain message
[1:00:28] he preached it in the message invisible
[1:00:31] union
[1:00:32] let me show you how he started this
[1:00:34] message all
[1:00:36] so he goes in the invisible unit he's
[1:00:38] going to preach so he goes with and he
[1:00:40] starts it off with prophecy right he
[1:00:43] goes and he says
[1:00:45] invisible union page 5
[1:00:47] and he says
[1:00:48] now
[1:00:50] in romans 7 i trust that you have your
[1:00:53] bibles open
[1:00:55] everywhere across the country anyway he
[1:00:57] realized this was so important right
[1:00:59] we want to read closely now
[1:01:02] just smash it out of here it seems like
[1:01:05] his own
[1:01:06] marriage and divorce
[1:01:08] what was he doing why did he go back
[1:01:10] because marriage and divorce was
[1:01:12] original sin that fell in the garden so
[1:01:14] all therefore they ever get straightened
[1:01:16] out we had no opposition what happened
[1:01:19] why we got to go back and go back to
[1:01:21] eden because that's where we fell from
[1:01:23] so he gets through message marriage and
[1:01:25] divorce
[1:01:26] romans seven right he said to me it
[1:01:29] seems like his own marriage in the boy
[1:01:32] but he was saying i'm going back and i'm
[1:01:33] picking up everything that adam lost
[1:01:36] hallelujah going back now through this
[1:01:37] man i got to pick up everything that
[1:01:39] adam lost all right glory he'll marry a
[1:01:41] new voice he's a but i realize to me it
[1:01:45] is prophecy right right to the to for
[1:01:48] the church in the last days
[1:01:51] let us read then he go say no you're not
[1:01:53] didn't go to the bro he said no not
[1:01:55] brother for i speak to to them that know
[1:01:57] the law how that the law has have
[1:01:59] dominion over a man as long as he lives
[1:02:02] hallelujah indeed he goes right to the
[1:02:03] church he's sure the woman must have
[1:02:05] another word and the way all over the
[1:02:06] husband lives she's under that law he
[1:02:08] goes into these things right here i'm
[1:02:09] not going to get mad before don't get
[1:02:10] nervous
[1:02:13] what was he doing why did he go to that
[1:02:16] because now he he's dealing with
[1:02:17] something in the beginning
[1:02:19] that woman fell from which was the type
[1:02:22] of the church
[1:02:23] what did he fall for she fell from the
[1:02:26] position of the word right
[1:02:28] and adam fell to the position of the
[1:02:30] wife
[1:02:31] which become perverted
[1:02:34] boy it's a powerful scripture let me let
[1:02:36] me just deal with this real quick
[1:02:40] believe me people don't caught up in
[1:02:41] this thing right now so
[1:02:43] when adam fell
[1:02:45] he fell from the position
[1:02:48] by listening to his wife
[1:02:50] in other words he was the one and he was
[1:02:53] co-equal with adam as long as she say
[1:02:55] submission to his shield
[1:02:58] you submission to the word and lord you
[1:03:00] stay submission to your pastor right
[1:03:02] right in the word that the way they
[1:03:04] probably put it as long as he stays with
[1:03:06] the word you have no right
[1:03:07] you have no right you have no right to
[1:03:10] if he's preaching you the word you have
[1:03:12] no right
[1:03:13] to challenge him in any way
[1:03:15] or try to turn him anyway
[1:03:19] ain't that true bro
[1:03:20] that one we got two he's a two spirits
[1:03:22] that dominate the church two spirits
[1:03:23] what would they be jezebel ism and and
[1:03:26] bayleism right a nicoletta listen
[1:03:28] brother
[1:03:29] try to control one control the church
[1:03:31] one controller the pastor but the point
[1:03:33] over there we need the control of the
[1:03:34] word
[1:03:35] so now what did that do adam failed in
[1:03:37] other words so this is what he goes and
[1:03:39] picks up romans seven how do what he do
[1:03:42] straighten out without him done done
[1:03:44] right yeah right and then and and in
[1:03:46] genesis 3 verse
[1:03:48] verse uh 17 it says here and he said it
[1:03:51] in adam
[1:03:52] because god
[1:03:53] has talked unto the voice
[1:03:56] of thy wife
[1:03:57] that's genesis 3 17
[1:03:59] because god has hearkened to the voice
[1:04:02] of thy wife in other words there's some
[1:04:04] other voice there but one voice
[1:04:06] hallelujah your name but one voice in
[1:04:08] the day of the voice of the seven angel
[1:04:10] it was not voices if there's another
[1:04:12] voice there there's an unclean spirit
[1:04:14] working in the church hallelujah then he
[1:04:16] says here he says here i want you to
[1:04:18] notice right here it was one voice here
[1:04:19] he said he said it right here in verse
[1:04:21] 17. and under adam he said because i
[1:04:23] have heard that to the voice of thy wife
[1:04:26] and has eaten
[1:04:28] of the tree which i
[1:04:30] command thee saying thy shall not eat of
[1:04:34] it
[1:04:35] the voice of god say don't do it right
[1:04:38] step on the e say we can do it that's
[1:04:40] what the church tells the people today
[1:04:42] you're gonna have to live like this
[1:04:43] they're just taking it too far you can
[1:04:45] make the rapture god don't mind if you
[1:04:46] drink a little bit you think that
[1:04:50] yourself in the frying pan here we are
[1:04:53] amen so that adam's done this
[1:04:56] now remember adam in a position that god
[1:04:58] could not curse adam and remain god
[1:05:01] because of every soul of god was god
[1:05:03] so god would have cursed out he would
[1:05:05] have to put a crush on his own self
[1:05:07] right and he said it in his own word he
[1:05:10] said
[1:05:11] curse it is the ground right for our
[1:05:14] sake right
[1:05:15] so he bypass
[1:05:17] the soul it cuts the ground right why
[1:05:20] because say they gonna get his hand on
[1:05:21] the book of life right the lamb's
[1:05:22] looking like and when he was gonna go
[1:05:24] get his head on the soul of adam he
[1:05:25] would have perverted he had to go back
[1:05:26] to his redeemer hallelujah he said what
[1:05:28] did he do he said the book that he went
[1:05:29] back to the kids from a redeemer i knew
[1:05:31] god knew that adam wouldn't be lost
[1:05:33] right right how do sure he says here
[1:05:34] he's said because it'd be graffiti i say
[1:05:37] and solve i eat of it all the days
[1:05:39] of thy life those that this one shall he
[1:05:41] bring forth to thee and i shall eat does
[1:05:43] he eat the herd of the field did he say
[1:05:46] if he went on here let me go yeah that's
[1:05:47] good and right 19 yeah
[1:05:50] and then the sweat
[1:05:52] right anybody here don't sweat
[1:05:56] if you don't sweat you did
[1:05:59] because sweaters are fulfilling a
[1:06:01] prophecy of a curse
[1:06:03] it had to happen
[1:06:04] now everybody know right now i'm not
[1:06:06] dead
[1:06:09] sweat is a fulfillment of prophecy you
[1:06:11] know what what does it mean i'm perfect
[1:06:13] i said do you sweat
[1:06:15] well yeah i said you ain't perfect
[1:06:17] because they didn't sweat you just
[1:06:18] happened
[1:06:19] hallelujah this was a sign that you died
[1:06:22] every time you sweat every time you
[1:06:23] sweat preaching this way every day your
[1:06:25] pastor get up and he give labor brought
[1:06:26] away get up here and label and sweat
[1:06:28] coming in that's a sign they give in
[1:06:30] their life right that's the sign you
[1:06:32] swear you're giving that life
[1:06:33] that while you get through sweat and
[1:06:34] you're warm and you're tired you've got
[1:06:36] to replenish yourself with drinking
[1:06:37] water and trying to get food why because
[1:06:39] your body's giving out life right how do
[1:06:42] you say in the other word he's in the
[1:06:44] sweat of our face
[1:06:46] that should eat bread
[1:06:48] until i returned unto the ground for out
[1:06:50] of it was not taken for dust thou are
[1:06:54] and unto dust shall i return right so
[1:06:56] what did he do he cursed the earth
[1:07:00] he gave satan permission
[1:07:02] to put sickness on your body
[1:07:05] but not your soul
[1:07:07] told job you could touch everything but
[1:07:08] you can't touch your soul
[1:07:10] you could take all you got but you can't
[1:07:12] touch the why satan had dominion for the
[1:07:14] body right but he never had dementia oh
[1:07:17] joe's soul
[1:07:19] what did he do when satan got this
[1:07:21] element
[1:07:22] of of power in the earth the earth was
[1:07:26] cursed somebody shed in the blood had
[1:07:28] not only redeemed man same plan of
[1:07:30] redemption deemed the earth by and the
[1:07:32] man's he used the same place why i got
[1:07:33] to earth
[1:07:34] that's what we're in
[1:07:36] and you might thank you as good as you
[1:07:38] was when you was 20 years old
[1:07:40] and if you think you ain't good enough
[1:07:42] you can buy your holiday and grow your
[1:07:44] ponytail it won't work
[1:07:48] you get up to 120 all your hair blow out
[1:07:54] i mean just that way you know we i know
[1:07:55] we all we and you know old man's field
[1:07:57] you know every time we get filming i'm
[1:07:59] pretty good
[1:08:00] yeah i remember one time i mean my son
[1:08:02] was in a weight room
[1:08:04] i walked over there to a bench
[1:08:06] i probably at that time i might have
[1:08:08] been 40
[1:08:09] 46 maybe
[1:08:11] i walked up there until he had 250
[1:08:13] pounds on i said let me show this boy
[1:08:15] what kind of dead what kind of man he
[1:08:17] got
[1:08:18] for a dad
[1:08:19] i got that on that bench
[1:08:26] three times
[1:08:28] i got up and i stuck my chest out i
[1:08:30] looked at my boy
[1:08:31] i said you see that son
[1:08:34] he got down there he said
[1:08:41] and i looked at my ain't going to show
[1:08:42] you everything i know
[1:08:48] this curses on this body
[1:08:51] why because once satan got the plan to
[1:08:53] the earth
[1:08:54] he was able to produce
[1:08:57] thorns and thistles which is now in to
[1:08:59] be burned right they're going to be
[1:09:01] rejected and burned right so now we go
[1:09:04] back to your prophecy now this is what
[1:09:05] it is this prophecy the curse of the
[1:09:07] earth is on our bodies this is what we
[1:09:10] our soul been redeemed back but we got
[1:09:11] to go back and get a redeemed body then
[1:09:13] we go back to the redeem earth holy so
[1:09:15] now the plan of a deal why we gotta read
[1:09:17] why we in the shape we i had to read
[1:09:20] what reader died just said he goes right
[1:09:22] here he's a reader he's a reader that
[1:09:24] just here not long ago
[1:09:26] where young girls are going through
[1:09:28] menopause
[1:09:30] and means
[1:09:31] the change of life between 20 and 25
[1:09:34] years old
[1:09:37] the change of oh man this guy y'all
[1:09:40] thanks man
[1:09:42] what a hit my ass i'm glad i thank god
[1:09:45] for science too he
[1:09:47] just says go ahead younger going through
[1:09:49] the
[1:09:50] menopause
[1:09:52] between
[1:09:53] the change of life between 20
[1:09:55] and 25 years old
[1:09:58] they are
[1:10:00] they are going through the middle edge
[1:10:03] now you know that that right there and
[1:10:05] that's some people's habits some
[1:10:07] people's
[1:10:07] uh some people this is uh
[1:10:10] it probably know that causal just right
[1:10:12] here is going to do this especially this
[1:10:13] other generation now we know uh the
[1:10:16] brother just had a baby we know he's not
[1:10:18] going to do none of this
[1:10:22] so he didn't pass 25 he told me he was
[1:10:23] 38 years old so here we are
[1:10:26] so he goes there so the dirty corruption
[1:10:28] why because of science research
[1:10:31] of food the only weapon that satan had
[1:10:34] we love
[1:10:36] food
[1:10:37] man didn't think years ago you could eat
[1:10:39] a biscuit and run all day
[1:10:41] you eat a biscuit two hours later i'm
[1:10:43] hungry
[1:10:46] satan's science
[1:10:48] has begun satan has been walking to tear
[1:10:50] down his body
[1:10:52] and when he get the body we he
[1:10:53] eventually goes to the brain and he
[1:10:55] weakens not only the body the brain and
[1:10:57] the body so he goes and he starts
[1:10:59] working to death why because science and
[1:11:01] research and food that have broken down
[1:11:04] have broke down from the natural thing
[1:11:06] we should put in our what
[1:11:09] that why we have to take vitals it ain't
[1:11:12] nothing natural
[1:11:13] but all the stuff ain't natural that's
[1:11:15] the good stuff
[1:11:17] you know you get a hamburger you know
[1:11:18] you're dying but you're dying happy
[1:11:21] i mean you're my way to believe you know
[1:11:23] when you're saying y'all shouldn't be
[1:11:24] eating this hamburger and you think but
[1:11:26] man that joker looks so good
[1:11:31] we are we have nothing but a bunch of
[1:11:33] mush
[1:11:34] of dying corruption now that's what the
[1:11:37] church is also in the it's the same what
[1:11:41] right he goes he goes in the way there
[1:11:43] he goes right there if you notice he's
[1:11:45] taking this and he goes back to the fall
[1:11:47] in the garden and he put the church on
[1:11:49] the same level right right right what
[1:11:51] did he do
[1:11:52] what we eat
[1:11:54] hallelujah what we eat so the revelation
[1:11:56] is what are you gonna restore it fell
[1:11:59] from eating the word
[1:12:01] if you notice in the prophecy in the
[1:12:02] beginning adam fell from eating he
[1:12:05] failed to eat the word to live forever
[1:12:07] so if the church fell from eating the
[1:12:09] word how he must restore it back right
[1:12:11] by eat it just take the book
[1:12:14] by probably and eat the book what it's
[1:12:17] going to turn your body back like it was
[1:12:19] in the beginning we need to put the
[1:12:20] right things back in our body and the
[1:12:22] only thing that can change your body is
[1:12:24] the word
[1:12:26] i could go on and on but i'm going to
[1:12:28] get red prop i got my parachute on
[1:12:30] something i'll leave something to say
[1:12:31] this
[1:12:33] because i see it today now i'm going to
[1:12:35] get the following away real quick
[1:12:37] that's the one i want to close on
[1:12:40] falling away why are so many people
[1:12:42] falling away
[1:12:43] brother brandon goes in and he takes
[1:12:45] another quote
[1:12:46] and he begin to speak on this
[1:12:49] going yeah this is it
[1:12:51] he they paid nor but not paid 11. he
[1:12:53] said let me prophesy something to you
[1:12:56] let me prophesy not just go and say a
[1:12:58] word right not just say a word because
[1:13:01] it'll be different where you can say
[1:13:02] well that's his opinion but if his
[1:13:04] prophecy didn't mean that he just spoke
[1:13:06] it then we got to wait till the event
[1:13:07] made clear
[1:13:08] so now he let me prophesy something to
[1:13:10] you
[1:13:11] just before it comes to pass
[1:13:15] so that make it prophecy he's speaking
[1:13:17] it
[1:13:18] man i clear this guy good
[1:13:21] man that's all right let me find what
[1:13:23] paragraph is that but huh 82. hell yeah
[1:13:27] that's why bartima that's all right
[1:13:30] you know tell brothers tell brother sam
[1:13:32] you are resigning your job and you're
[1:13:34] going to be traveling with me for now
[1:13:39] amen okay okay
[1:13:42] and i need your boy man i wouldn't have
[1:13:44] never wear my glasses he said let him
[1:13:46] prophesy something to you
[1:13:49] before it come to pass
[1:13:51] the whole world
[1:13:53] is groping in what right
[1:13:57] and
[1:13:58] we'll get worser
[1:14:03] and
[1:14:03] worser
[1:14:05] and worser until they become a bunch of
[1:14:09] the writers
[1:14:11] and it's almost that way right right

[1:14:20] prophecy
[1:14:22] we have seen it got worser
[1:14:24] and worser and worser until they become
[1:14:27] a bunch of neurotics
[1:14:30] people they got no natural affection for
[1:14:32] life
[1:14:33] you'll get more time today for killing a
[1:14:35] man dog you killing the owner
[1:14:40] so what we gonna do about this is know
[1:14:42] we can do about it to fall in the way
[1:14:44] coming people are falling away the minds
[1:14:46] is breaking down why because in the
[1:14:48] natural their bodies is breaking
[1:14:49] people's bodies weak today
[1:14:52] everywhere you go there's a pharmacy
[1:14:56] every corner when i was a boy you never
[1:14:58] i didn't even we had one drugstore in
[1:15:00] the town
[1:15:02] central dun dun right in the town you
[1:15:04] get sick that's where you went
[1:15:06] but the day i got a book i got to go in
[1:15:08] and find out which one i want to go to
[1:15:10] you got ride a's you got cbs you got
[1:15:13] this over here and this they all over
[1:15:14] there why did they show you their
[1:15:16] society and the coming of the lord that
[1:15:18] our bodies is materializing and breaking
[1:15:21] down so when the body we tell light and
[1:15:22] break down what do the people turn to
[1:15:24] what do people turn to they turn to
[1:15:26] sorcery that's what some pharmacy means
[1:15:28] they turn back to sorcery they try to
[1:15:31] heal themselves by medicine ain't even
[1:15:33] one thing you can heal the body that the
[1:15:34] blood of jesus christ
[1:15:37] that prophecy here
[1:15:39] we got to get realized here people
[1:15:41] people fall away their minds are falling
[1:15:43] away they rejected the message why
[1:15:45] because they don't eat the word this day
[1:15:47] y'all they got some man-made idea
[1:15:50] well my church was that what fell with
[1:15:52] the church
[1:15:53] i said you said well i'm going to be
[1:15:54] deceived how can i be deceived see
[1:15:56] that's what i want to get out of your
[1:15:57] mind how can you be deceived
[1:16:00] now if you say i'm deceived you're
[1:16:02] saying i have a perverted spirit
[1:16:04] i'm feminine
[1:16:06] because the feminist spirit was diseased
[1:16:09] but when we if you notice here when we
[1:16:11] get back and restore back to the word it
[1:16:12] says let the mind that was in christ
[1:16:14] not the mind that was in eve hallelujah
[1:16:17] what did he do he bring you back to your
[1:16:18] position honey adam was never deceived
[1:16:21] he was deceived adam was not guilty he
[1:16:24] was that what he tried to bring about
[1:16:26] when the word cannot be deceived
[1:16:28] that's the man's seed for this all that
[1:16:30] is what prophecy calls about back to the
[1:16:33] word so we cannot be deceived
[1:16:35] church i thank god for the word
[1:16:36] musicians come on all right
[1:16:39] that's why we can't be deceived
[1:16:41] why the word cannot be deceived
[1:16:44] she was deceived right she would deceive
[1:16:47] if you remember him when adam fell what
[1:16:49] did he tell adam adam when that unveiled
[1:16:51] when adam had his wife when adam had his
[1:16:55] when adam had it when god took his wife
[1:16:57] out
[1:16:57] what did he do
[1:16:59] he put adam into a what
[1:17:01] a deep sleep
[1:17:04] a deep sleep
[1:17:06] and he opened the side of adam
[1:17:09] and he took out of the side of adam
[1:17:11] a rib
[1:17:13] and all these things
[1:17:14] and he gave adam
[1:17:16] uh uh a help me
[1:17:19] and adam called her woman
