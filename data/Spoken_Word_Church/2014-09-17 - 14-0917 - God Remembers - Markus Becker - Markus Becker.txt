TRANSCRIPT
========================================
shake hands with the one next to you and say the movie and i amen you believe it you know the prophet said that's thus saith the lord the move is on so it's up to us to move with it amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord good to be here on a wednesday night everything glad to have our brother with us we won't say much about other than just he has he's the one helping our instrumental in putting on a thing called the message companion and it's really from what i've seen of it is real good it's got dvds with it it's got everything brother luis can help us with other things later and telling us about it because he knows a lot about it and things but it's kind of a thing showing you like when brother adam would speak of the squirrels then it relates to that area and that doings and the things you know and tells a lot about the different things is what little i've looked through it and we have we will order some and let them you know let our brother bring him back to us but we just let him explain what he wants to to us and that way he can can bring it all out in the open and let us know what they're trying to do but we appreciate him and he's one he's living proof of one thing you know brother branham said east nation nation and things has a spirit and has this that or the other but you know the brother is living proof that the new birth can change you totally around he's a german supposed to be staunch and you know blunt but he you know what he's just like us i mean that's what we found out we made some good contact today while we're eating and just having a good time and all and i hope you see what i mean about it and i'm not throwing off on donations no nothing just being the truth about it the holy spirit can make us all be the same no matter where we're at so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart as brother marcus becker comes to speak unto us he's from germany he'll be here for a week or two and on and traveling so you pray for him but this this open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i want to see i want to see openly thank you very much in shining in the light of the glory maybe when the music is slightly playing uh that we are praying together again and maybe you're very slightly playing and while we were having our heads bowed and if somebody has a need on his heart that he may raise his hands to the lord and just as a little background heavenly father we are very thankful for this welcoming spirit father and my heart's desire is that you may speak to each and every one lord you made a certain subject on my heart and it seems that you want to encourage someone father on our way back home father we believe we came from eternity and we go back to eternity father lord on this earth lord we have a lot to go through but as david said the lord is my shepherd i shall not be in wand and may you especially speak to us this evening that have a little bit of a feebleness of a weakness maybe a little bit discouraged maybe frustrated from life and lord may you strengthen us with your power by the holy ghost and by the word we ask for this noble pastor for his church may you bless them and continue to bless them and may you bless every hand that's raised up to you and may you speak to us father ask it in jesus name amen hallelujah thank you very much the brothers god bless you richly and i think while we're standing we are starting with the opening of the word with the spirit with the scripture being read and i give some greetings but i think i don't want to let you stand that way and we are going to read uh the familiar scripture in the second book of kings in chapter 4 and verse 32 and it is the very famous story of elisha and the chunamide woman and when elisha was coming to the house behold the child was dead and laid upon the bed he went in there before and shut the door upon the twain and prayed unto the lord and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes and he called gehasi and said call the shunamite so he called her and when she was coming unto him he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out may the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word and we may be seated and pastor there is time for me to put up the jackets thank you very much you know i'm you made such nice compliments that i have to fulfill what you said and and i thank you very much for this nice invitation for me to be here and uh for the wonderful fellowship with the way for you yourself with the sisters for the eating and but the luis who's taking really care of me and for those who don't know me and my name is marcus becker i come from germany and i'm here for two weeks for exactly that project and if you you allow you just i just say just a word what we what we made is we were we were bringing all the events that happened in the later part of brother brandon we put them in between of his sermon titles so that if you see if you're reading a certain preaching of a certain message you understand what happened in the ministry of brother branham uh in the denominational world at that time we even put israel right into it what happened to israel exactly because i saw the israel flag we are standing so we are one in that thing i mean uh we love that country we love the gods people there so it is uh let me see while the supernatural books is is following certain let me say a certain line now this is a panoramic view about everything that happened around we understand that uh let me say that many of the young people is is they're not reading the message as they should and i understand it in that way because the message is a huge mountain of 1100 books i mean where to start and what to end and so it is not it is so this message companion is explaining let me say uh telling the life and the and the events let me say like kennedy coming up and kennedy being murdered and all these things that happened especially to the us like uh uh uh uh like um fidel castro came up in a political world and then you understand when brother brandon makes certain stan statements what happened to this and so we want to encourage them to read it uh and to use it we didn't call it a book it's a companion that means we for those who love the message that means those who doesn't love the mess will not love the book neither but it's for those who are reading message messy books you know and you're to feeling to to feed on it and then there is a little dvd that means we went over there two years ago to arizona and we were filming in hd quality the places where the prophet was with a very gentle help of our noble brother green you know he said we always wanted to do this and here comes some some hillbillies from germany and they but but that's some i mean that's how it is but it i want to say like this it was a it was a friendship project of of of germany of south africa and of of of the states of the united states because our noble brother lonnie was helping a lot in that in that book you know with his kind of proofreading and so forth and we trust is is a blessing because it's not a doctrinal book of trying to defend or anything like this as we said uh we were just speaking in the car today i mean we cannot hinder that every revival brings false twins i mean that's that's that's god's law you know and it's no you know you waste your time in preaching against false doctrines because if one camp is destroyed the next one comes up i mean but but what we want to do is to preach the right dollar right and all the rest becomes clear right and i think that's so important and i believe this message it's pla explains itself so much right and so therefore we we we want to give this and and we uh yeah it is our contribution let me say maybe for our next generation if the lord is carrying we don't believe in being here too much time on this earth but but uh let me say to let the message explain itself right and then uh we sometimes we put certain events in the in in this in in the life of the prophet we bring it back into the bible i mean let me be honest with you uh we all we're all rejoicing that brother brennan went to sabino canyon here's the sword in his hand but where is the need to have a picture with the eagle and a sword in his hand if you don't understand what does it mean for me then it becomes just a cult just uh it's become you know and then you have to find the bible okay now here is joshua entering to the promised land that's what we believe and the first thing that happened is here's a mankind with a sword in his hand right and he says i'm he and he was the the leader of of of of of the princes of of the heavenly host and i mean here comes brother abraham and he has he has that that sword into his hand and it fitted exactly my hands i mean therefore i always said this and i hope you don't take it personally but this message that we believe doesn't come from america it comes from the presence of almighty i mean that's that's true i mean that's what the angel told the prophet i'm sent from the presence of almighty and and so we are very thankful for this and we we understand that it had to be an american preaching yet uh because we understand that the gospel goes from the east to the west and then it goes in that way you know and uh therefore we don't believe too much in an eighth messenger because you know because the the history comes at the end on sunset mountain on the west coast of america so the eighth messenger must live in the sea in the in the pacific ocean we don't believe too much in those things you know maybe we will see a picture you see at home i'm a plumber you know i have a good qualification but i'm i i i i i i i choose to make a simple job to have more time for the lord you know but we're simple people and we believe this message is for simple people you don't have to have a theological background but you have a heart right with god and then the holy spirit brings revelation and it has nothing to do how how high the iq is or how low the iq is sometimes a high iq stands in in in our own way you know exactly right and i think you you found out already that when i'm preaching in english you have to take what i want to say okay don't take i can really say don't take what i said but what i want to say and brother we have certain other things we made some interviews and we are continuing this week and brother louis is helping me and thank you very much for everything brother louise your family pastor dale brother wade for all of you it's a pleasure for me to be here around i always say this the the germans are very nice people but only those who have the holy ghost but i believe it's for the americans the same that that it has to be it has to be that way you know and but i'm i'm very happy thank you thank you very much for this compliment pastor dale and uh it is so that we have to break away from our nation national spirits we have to await break away from our cult you know culture is many times cult you know and culture makes you feel better than others i mean we are sinners safe by grace and the prophet said something very very nice he says if you want to continue with god never let an arrogant spirit come among you therefore i'm not too much uh let me say uh uh we are the super eagles and the great eagles and then we are those speakers but if you are an eagle you don't have to tell that you are an eagle people will feel that you have something you know you don't a real true believer doesn't have to defend to explain himself all the way he is what he is by god's grace you know exactly so and blessed be the name of the lord i really feel well and if you wouldn't mind i go direct in the subject because i made another promise that i will not take more time than your normal local service because i'm i have a lot of disadvantages but i have some advantages too and one of the advantages i know to respect people and know how to respect churches and how they feel and and and therefore even if you say take time i know we have children here i want to tell them i want to be i want to see them tomorrow at school in good condition in good shape uh making good marks you know they don't have any kind of an excuse mama i have a bad mark because the preacher was too long no no i take my time to to to finish exactly when you have your service finished again i for me it's a privilege to be here and brother dale again thank you very much the lord bless you rich i know he has different ministers here and it doesn't make me nervous but it makes me let me say uh it makes me appreciating that privilege that i have for this evening yeah i really really thank you very much for this right bless it be the name of the lord now the the text i was i'm i'm i'm a little bit of a praying type of a man to be honest i take a lot of time to be just uh alone with the lord i'm not a uh uh a complicated person but i find out that you can have a good sermon but it must be inspired by the lord and what i find out too is that sometimes the holy spirit is leaving a hundred people just to speak to one or two and maybe 89 said i mean we heard this already and two said now that was for me you know i mean that's what a shepherd does you know and so he laid something on my heart which a subject that i love a lot because it deals with god remembers and we find out that here is a story in the bible of a shunammite woman and the prophet elijah and i want to make the mixture between elijah and elisha because both both were prophets one was following the other right and those were men at the same time right yeah and the greatness in man in god is that god can understand man because you became man and that kind of uh we know the story of the prophet elij elijah when he went into the wilderness after his great victory on mount carmel i mean killing 400 prophets and then here's jesse bell and bringing out that threat yeah and we understand that when he went into the wilderness brother branham preached two times about this and he says what does thou hear elijah and what does thou hear elijah and we understand that brother branham preached about his own situation at that time because 1959 1960 it was the time when he preached a rejected king now the denomination already left him because they wanted to have the gift of the messenger but they didn't want to have the message exactly so and we understand that he was in that situation and he says that elijah went into the wilderness and he left his servant gihasi behind him and here's brother what the prophet said which is gold to understand people because brother brahms says that if persons come in that condition they want to be alone yeah i mean i always say dears if people goes to problems they don't need bible slogans they don't need just a quote they don't need you you only believe on brother no no i mean i always tell this you have you have to have leadership to help a person going through a through a moment of difficulties the great pioneers by the name of arthur rubinstein he was asked the question is it difficult to play piano and archer rubinstein said no it's very simple you just have to press the right buttons at the right time and i mean to have a to correct a person is very simple too you just have to be the right person at the right time at the right sp place in the right spirit saying the right thing and the other one understands it in the right way in his right time it's so simple so if if you want to help a person comfort a person many times no word is the best words instead of just bringing some bible slogans and that prophet elijah said he wanted he wanted to be alone so when he was alone god saw the man yeah and he sends down an angel and i want to say this tie deals to revelation 10 for our day time because that angel had something to eat right and the prophet said and and you see the wisdom of god because brother branham preaches about a sickness that never exists in the 60s but it's existing today what we call the burn out system the burn out the heart attack the man the the sickness for manager completely and and elijah came to that point of a complete burn out it was not even invented that kind of a sickness and the profit speaks about people who are working too much and there are people who are working to less man so we are not believing too much in jobless conditions if you're in that condition i mean don't say it is god-given try to do something exactly so if if you did everything you don't have a job that's another thing but try to do anything with that you can do to serve the lord and and and when god came down i mean he didn't didn't come down just with words just with slogans but he sent an angel and that angel put elijah to sleep and brother blame said that is the problem of people today they are overworked they are stressed he said it's a problem with their nerves nothing with the soul but with the nerves of the people and when he when he was waking up then that angel had something to eat and he says elijah eat because by the strength of that of that of that cookies of these cakes you will you will go for a long way now when he received that that kind of food he was running unto the mountain of the lord the mount horeb for 40 days the prophet said i wanted to know which kind of vitamins were in those cakes and and and take our time i mean this is a dark age this is what the prophet called satan's eden there was never a time so hard to serve the lord than today i hope i can say it behind the pulpit but i i i will use it in nice words this is the complete age of immorality where people have a lot of problems because it's pressing upon people this is the age of of of of of network and i'm i'm i'm i i i see a great danger in those things exactly so and it seems that that you know that demon power is coming down but i want to say jesus is winner because he sent us a message which is not only in formation but it is spiritual food in due seasons amen because that angel had a book in his hand and the bride has to eat that book now tie that to what jesus said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me it was never fulfilled in jesus time as jesus of nazareth but we had a prophet who said you're not feasting from me but from the body word of christ i mean therefore this message what we believe is red bull amen can you say amen now now you don't see very much but when i was a boy i was making bodybuilding we were not believers at that time but and therefore we were we didn't know god and so i had two stars in my life one was sylvester stallone and one was arnold schwarzenegger and i i remember i saw that film by the name of conan you know and and and schwarzenegger who is just using his breast muscle he goes like so so so i went there to make some bodybuilding and i went back before the mirror and i looked but there was nothing doing that that's how it went but but so and and i always say the church is everything that you see here was here it just changed its place okay right therefore don't invest too much time in bodybuilding if you're a sister don't invest too much too much money in cosmetics because you are getting older anyhow i mean okay but for the brothers the same i have a nice uh we're not making to correct jokes but i have a nice story that one one a boy saw saw some wedding photos of his of his mama and daddy right and and he says mama uh i mean who is the man on that photo you know a nice nice young man and he says uh she said no that's daddy and he says and who is the fat one with no hair who is living now in our home if not only is jesus we become older but they have good news there is a theory waiting there is a there's a new body waiting therefore don't we always tell our young people don't make too much bodybuilding make soul building by the word of the lord but what i find out i was a young boy and i found out when i'm making was making bodybuilding if you want to have muscles you cannot eat mcdonald's my you need a you need a steak you need something solid to eat and the prophet of god said face has muscles on his breast hair on his breast i'm a face has muscle so if you want to have face muscles you cannot eat facebook you cannot eat harry potter you cannot watch television you have to have a spiritual stake that's the message of the hour something solid to eat you cannot live from facebook and all these things it's it's you it's nothing for your soul right now therefore we understand god understood the situation of that prophet and take this to the prophet elijah now when he came through those cities uh i i i'm sure that he hadn't have a a t-shirt by the name of elisha the prophet he was a man like all the rest of them but while he was walking to that city israel didn't like them at all right israel were they hated those prophets now you have to see one thing that 42 children were killed because of the respectlessness of the parents you see that when elijah came through the children made fun of the prophet elijah and he turned around and cursed them and two bears came now brother branham says it like this he said the children said on the streets what the parents said behind the curtains now be sure that the spirit that you have will fall on your children if you don't like a minister they don't like that minister neither because it's the anointing which governs your home if you speak critically they become critics amen uh we have a slogan in germany and i believe it is it is the same for here it says show me your company and i'll show you who you are right that means if you are in a train with five smokers and you cannot come out of that train and you're not a smoker but when you come out of that train you are smelling like all the rest of the smokers it is the question with whom we have fellowship with whom we have therefore we tell our young people to your if you want to have a friend show search somebody who is closer to the lord than you yourself and it will not work with some facebook friends because you don't know who's on the other line that's for sure but what happened is this i mean i i i was a sunday school teacher and i'm i want to be honest i'm leaning a little bit towards legalism but that's that is fine for you can you say amen i'm a little bit of a conservative type i'm young but i'm very conservative but uh you know we i was in a a sunday school teacher and we had two boys they came in like this and i wondered myself who the parents were and i was in the sanctuary and soon i found out who the parents were because they were too coming in like this the way we come to church they will come to church the way we respect the lord they will respect the lord therefore i always say and i'm happy as a guest minister you can take all the liberty because you don't know really but we always say it's home don't come always too late to church because you're teaching your children a lesson to disrespect god no exactly so you you can you can say it's the traffic but it cannot be the traffic every wednesday and every sunday okay no don't do this i mean the way you they come you come they will come therefore we believe that the parents should be prayed up before they come to church take their children into an atmosphere and really be really ask the lord to speak to their hearts elijah elisha lived in that country and those people they didn't like it and it kept and it costs the life of these children oh wow god help us that we understand we have a responsibility for our youngsters not only in words but by our behavior but our by our ways how we speak how we think i think uh american children are the same as germans because you know uh uh when when when they shouldn't listen to something they they find it out i don't know exactly how they make it but they are playing somewhere but the ear goes and and and you you're telling something critically after three weeks they tell you what you're told right exactly they have they have a they have a a heavily heavenly navigation system or something like a uh how do you call it nba system uh or nsa system right they have it already included by birth they listen to all things that they shouldn't listen to so therefore the prophet said even our our our thoughts should be sanctified before the lord right i mean now it caused the the the life of these children but we will find out some example of people who saved their household by vision because that woman i mean she saw that prophet elijah or elijah when he passed by she was just standing there and she says i find out that this is a holy man now who told her i tell you the same god who told hetty right to do the same one because jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now let me say this as a key sentence it is no no matter how wrong you are in your doctrine i don't say i don't want to say you should be no no no no no but the holy spirit brings you on the track again no matter how deep you are in the message you are not deep in the message but if you can respect god there is a blessing on its way already for that other use absolutely so god it will pay off respect for god because that woman she had a vision that this man is a man of god and she said to her husband she said we are preparing a room for this man and whenever he comes by we make like life a little bit easier so that he may sit down we know that especially that church knows about that question that was asked to brother branham what is the reward of a prophet right in 1964 and i learned just before the service that that it was the mother of our most noble brother joseph who asked that question you know i didn't know before but the lord laid that subject on my heart brother brandon what is the reward of a prophet and brother branham said it it is to be a friend of a prophet remember the shunammite woman and i want to be honest i never understood it but today i understand because year by year passed by and the prophet and his servant went into that home right and you know she didn't say uh well i'm coming to church all these years and i'm i'm uh paying my tithing so i want to have some benefit it was not hurt talented thing for her it was normal to serve the lord aliyah it was not gehasi telling now we have to make a little social program uh let's collect some money for that woman because she was a knight no no but it was god speaking to his prophets i mean when brother brain speaks about that woman inviting the prophet elijah in the message be certain of god he said it was not her bidding and it was god's bidding it was not him going it was god coming into that home in form of a man so that woman she said no i have everything and then we find out that she doesn't have a boy and the prophet says says to her say whatever it is in your heart and the lord will grant it exactly so whatever you want to have on your husband said she doesn't have a boy and we know that uh the children at that time were life insurance for the family right right so god in his greatness is honoring a woman who knows to honor god and brother brahman said you can do nothing for god unless that he pays it back for you blessed be the name of the lord i mean that is a message that always stirs my heart because i want to say it matters to serve the lord it matters to pray it matters to pay tithings all those people who don't pay their tithing it's not because they they they are too starchy to do it but they have a lack of revelation what is behind because there's a blessing going with that kind of an act i mean therefore we even believe now uh in that way i'm speaking to the wrong audience don't stay on sunday morning home put your feet on the desk and watch a service via internet if there is no church that's another thing and then you are just having your cup of coffee put your shoes on the desk and say amen brother preaching and you have honey you have another coffee for me brother brandon says we have to make a sacrifice in order to be blessed exactly so hallelujah somebody said brother marcus i'm just only listening to the best minister that is brother branham i said i make it the same way and there's no other message that i listen but at least monday tuesday thursday friday saturday the rest i go to church there's no contradiction at all right now when that happened we are finding out that time means nothing for god you see here is a man by the name of of abraham and abraham giving tithings to melchizedek and god remember it four generations later and make contribution up to up to levy i'm we're simple people man we we don't have nothing to to inherit or to give to our children now i'm a german without a mercedes-benz and that that that means something that means something so i'm not really a german but we're choosing that way whenever when we have money left we give it to the mission because we we say we're we i i have a castle anyhow it's already paid it's there it's just waiting i'm just having some years here on this earth we have a strategy in our family because i'm a full working person we say one week for the family and fight for the law because we have six weeks in in germany right you say brother marcus if you don't have a car and you don't you can have a car nothing or a house whatever uh you can have whatever you want but but let me say this do you can you inherit something to your daughter i said yes blessings brother branham came to a young man which came later brother makonda who was a pastor over there in tucson and brother lonnie always told us that story that brother brennan went to the young man and he says he was a businessman at that time he said your business is doing fine and all is well and and the young brother said yes brother i mean everything is going fine i don't know exactly and then i'm such a success and so forth and then brother bryan says something which is gold for us as parents he took him by the hand he says god blesses you because you have parents who loyal serve the lords if you want to inherit something to your children inherit blessings from parents who serve the lord i mean let me say you have a feeling for an older person in the church and you are visiting him maybe he is a handicapped one maybe he is old maybe he needs help and you are just there to help that person and god in heaven says to his angels i see what brother so-and-so does how can we help them and maybe god can say i will make that his children all their life will never be sick right because we have a king who is almighty hallelujah therefore elohim said to sarah is there anything to heart for the lord amen touching the heart of the lord not only god give give but doing something to please him and god will reward it anyhow amen can you say amen i want to say this it matters to serve the lord amen it matters to because you're reaping in your life you you have a feeling for others you're praying for others you give a phone call something to encourage and you are depressed yourself and god will wake somebody up to him to encourage you because you reap what you thought a real christian is not an egoistical person because he understands the blessing of my brother is my blessing he understands that there is a body work which is going on and then this and i want to tell it to the older people among us mostly people say brother mark is a youth preacher i mostly invite for youth game but let me speak about the use over 80 because your inner man is young anyhow we'll never become old right amen god remembers when we came to the message i mean i was around 20 we were we were we were we were unbelievers before i mean we were full of zeal that's true we were full of dynamics and we were full of naivety i mean whole germany comes to the message of the hour by marcus becker i mean and then god comes to form our character and then he goes and then i mean here comes the eagle i mean and after all these years in the message today we are just praying lord keep me faithful on the way is that true but remember you as older persons the prayers that you prayed 40 years ago we forgot what we prayed right but god did never forget god did not forget what you said when you were 40 years younger 50 years god for him it's present i i love i love that little illustration that brother billy paul made he said brother branham was there and here comes that little young girl with his shoes and she was a handicapped person and the prophet said now why do you have the new shoes and the young girl says brother bryan because when you pray for me i believe i'm gonna be healed amen and the prophet said why don't you sit down over there and so that your little faith is raising up a little bit i mean therefore we come to church right right amen preaching is not to the intellect preaching is to out to the inner man exactly is not right so brother brain was continuing i think two or three hours later behind the prophet was sitting his own brother by the name of donny and donnie was sitting behind brother branham and he was watching that girl and he thinks by himself man can you imagine this my father my brother forgot completely that little girl maybe he doesn't have faith and he wants to finish the service and then we are all dismissed and we all forget about that young girl and in that moment brother branham turns around he says no no no donny i didn't forget her and then he said something which is even greater donnie jesus didn't forget her neither i mean when we have prayed by faith god remembers we forget our own prayers but god remembers them he brings them up in his time hallelujah therefore it says in his time not your time not my time in his time he does great things blessed be the name of the lord amen therefore i always say this if you're you if you're new in the message or if you're young in the message i mean there is days when you feel saved and there is days where you feel very much saved and there is days where you feel the bride you make it you the rapture and then there is days you feel nothing right you you think did i make a start right but god is not looking about upon our present condition god looks on the inner man not our form our physical daily form god looks in eternity from eternity to eternity can you say amen therefore never put your christian faith on your feelings because your feelings will always deceive you stand on the word here i am therefore i always say this you must find your name in the bible i mean there is no marcus becker in the bible although the bible says take marcus with you he will be he will be useful for the ministry but i found my name because it says behold i will send you the prophet elijah and my bible says i sent marcus becker on all those who love this message the prophet elijah they are from myself blessed be the name of the lord god remembers amen right may it be a bomb mean to somebody to understand god knows where i am god knows who i am and god remembers me i always love that illustration you know about our god why we are bragging upon upon our lord jesus christ one day a young boy came to a shop to to buy some some some some some dogs and the the owner of the dogs came down and the boy said i want to have that dog and the owner said i mean that dog is handicapped i mean why don't you take another one this one cannot really run he doesn't have the value like the others why don't you take a a strong one and the boy was was putting off his his throws and from his knee down he had an artificial leg and he says i want to have this dog because if i'm going out with him he understands me and i understand and brother blame says this god became teenager so that he will understand the teenagers god became human so when you're praying about anything he knows what you talk about blessed be the name of the lord god became men to understand mankind and and that you don't have to tell stories oh lord you can't say lord here i am my my power is at the end but i'm counting on your energy i mean we cannot and we cannot see this message in a pentecostal vision i mean here's the prophet of god he received the holy ghost in the age of 20 21 and two times after he received the holy ghost he wanted to take his life explain this to a pentecostal i mean the holy ghost is joy it's it's it's yeah that's the holy ghost is is is many more things it's farming it's pressing it's it's wringling out our old nature that's how he goes to character farming time therefore we are not charismatic every day with jesus is better than the day is this your life it's not my life you say but who is happy my inside man he is happy all the days but we are going to distress to tensions to problems and then the sovereign hands of the lord comes and gives us deliverance hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord therefore we will make it not because of ourselves because of a mighty father who is taking care of us hallelujah i will just show you some examples and the technician helped me because i'm technically i'm just a hillbilly i mean just some example will you help me brother jose right now this is the picture i will not go through the text of because i will keep my time uh because brother blame said that man is as good as his word and that we will do like this but let it be little lessons which are not deep but at the same time very deep because we want to see people blessed and blessing is not always a question of doctrine blessing is a question of attitude amen you can be that you can be sitting among in branham tabernacle in the in the ministry of brother branham yourself or in the 60s but if your attitude is not right you will never get the full benefit of everything amen now this is this is this is congressman up show and you understand um he was he was crippled i think over 60 years before brother branham was preaching the holy ghost declared him to be healed nobody preached no altar call no line no no but the holy ghost said this in my words now his time is there right yeah all these 60 years god was just saying i have a date for him you could pull r you could pull put put oil on him you could invite ministers like you want to lay hands god has his time for everything and god is not nervous at all because god sees the end for the beginning you cannot push gods no you cannot stress god that is what the great evangel is trying to do in the kick around the bull god you have to do you promise god promised to heal but he has his time nobody tells god what to do and want to do glory can you say amen and he was his time was there and the holy spirit just said it's now time and brother bram said brought congressman absol is declared to be free to be healed next one please hallelujah right now this is this is this is a picture that we all know this is brother donnie wurtz right he is uh he is he we met him years ago he came with brother green this is brother branham and this is brother donnie with brother branham i always say my little brother donny i mean he was taller than brother green but look at this he said brother branham but because he had the cancer on his ear what's the matter donovan that ear he said brother banish it has been there for a long time i don't know i caught him by the hand there it was a big cancer on his ear never said one word just held it it was off my brother in a day or two after there wasn't even a scar left of it it was his respect to the god of heaven by the quickening power killed the cancer and spared the life of donovan vert back there amen exactly brother brahm did not say he was very deep in the dark we believe i'm i'm i like to teach a little bit but not this evening we don't say doctrine it's very important the opening of the word but i want to here god speaks about blessings by attitudes you are never you no matter no matter where somebody stands in the message or outside of the message you never make a mistake in respecting people you say denominational yeah we believe denomination they have there we know what the prophet said but when you are speaking face to face somebody you wish in god's blessings because because you are not the judge about this person he stands alone before god one day yeah all those who doesn't believe the message like us i mean we are the only eagles and all these chicken and the message now you are it's not our turn to say who is eagle who's chicken but make sure your life with god if nobody becomes judges and arrogant and you know no no no it is his attitude tell it to your children tell them tell them no matter what it is but we respect the lords respect for elders respect for ministers you're blessed already amen you have that attitude already your family is already blessed you can nothing to do against it because god loves respect god is not impressed by singing right right god is not but you know some some jingly swag got some jesus they call it the golden voice but i prefer a golden heart a silver voice or let me say a german voice but a golden heart you say oh my singing god was so impressed all the angels know how to sing i mean do you think god is impressed by our singing when all the hosts of heaven amen when they start to sing the pillars will start to will start to move but god in this arrogant age of loud is he a god is impressed by somebody who can show respect exactly so that is it was impressing god right now that woman sarah she is i think she is married to the pastor in the brandon tabernacle today sister sarah she's in the generation book now look at that look at that story and and and may this be again gold no matter where you're standing if you're old or young you're new in the message you're advancing the message but they had a photo that that they should do at the end of their uh let me see at the end of the school and on that photo a day everybody had had addressed a school uniform which is very very short now she refused to be on that photo and she got problems with her teacher and so forth because it was the final photo of the class she refused because it was too lucy for her to to wide open a couple of weeks later she was winning a sewing contest suing contest amen although that she was not very gifted a couple of weeks later brother branham phoned to that family and he was speaking to her father and then he says this can you give me uh rebecca i think rebecca's her name can you give me becky yes and he says and brother blame said this becky i heard that you were winning that number three in the suiting contest i think far far far far for the whole state of of indiana or kentucky and she said yes brother branham it was just uh uh was just great and then brother blame says this becky god gave you that victory because he saw your attitude when they made the photo amen exactly exactly i mean you you say brother marcus hair and clothing has nothing to do with salvation that's one thing but it's it shows my respect for god god will honor it it shows it blessed be the name of the lord little things that you can do just to honor hallelujah blessed be little little little things amen amen amen i could give a lot of example but we are going god remembers next one please right here is here is our robots here is the entrance to our roberts university i mean i mean look at this when brother branham came on the scene he was like david because nobody had feared goliath and nobody could uh win against goliath but here comes a little man with a little slingshot but with a commission from god and you see the bible when when david killed goliath the bible says all israel ran after after the philistines when the ministry of brother branham came up a lot of people saw it and made exactly the same thing right a allen tommy osborne tommy osborne was sitting in his meeting of brother branham and he said and the voice said you can do the same thing all these ministries come out of the ministry of brother branham but the problem is only this that loud this here has only one voice that's right exactly exactly they all have the sign but behind their signs is no voice because it says in the days of the voice singular and we as the fightful ministry we don't bring our own message but we are bringing to the people what was preached before already i mean because the bride has to prophesy again that means it was already prophesied we can update it a little bit but but we don't have a message of our own i'm not interested that my tapes go around i'm i'm i'm he said brother marcus why don't you why don't you speak so so little about your ministry and so big about brother branham's ministry because brother branham he he's already uh he passed over nearby i mean to be honest which minister today can say that the pillar of fire came already in the room when he was born right who can say this when i came to the message i wanted to ask my mother i mean when i was born did you see nothing no no no no the man therefore the bible doesn't say in the days of the man of the seventh century but in the voice and and god said martin luther and invented the press the printing press and god sent the seventh angel and we have all the tapes god god allowed it so that the voice is still living blessed peter but here is you understand what spiritual warfare is and we are under it and don't tell me brother marcus we don't tell what you're speaking this evening i know i'm because i know who where i'm going through because here is the prophet of god i mean he takes a whole audience under his control and here satan comes with thought because brother brain passed exactly by this this is the entrance of our robert university and he goes by this and satan says yeah you see look our roberts looked at university and you have just one typewriter and brother branham follows the thoughts which come from satan sometimes we follow these things too we have to exactly right huh and then brother builds up a complex and he says and look how how about satan what a liar he is because he said to brother yeah maybe god couldn't trust your money that's that that's exactly i mean here is a man who takes every spirit under his control right and satan come here maybe god couldn't trust you and brother ben believes that lie he says yes it may be so that god and he becomes a little bit depressed and then a voice come he says look up and he looks i am your portion blessing is not money blessing is not people blessing is eternally is heavenly we are not charismatic who believe oh god gave me got me a cadillac and you can you can have nothing on this world and be the most blessed person no here's the man i mean again the seals are open this is may 1963 the seals are open and brother brahma gets the complex preachers standing in the gap he said i'll build up a complex and look and look let me say like this don't expect unbelievers to understand you don't if you go to school even home school but if you go to university don't expect that everybody taps on your shoulder they they cannot do this right you have to bear a reproach for the message in germany we don't have homeschooling they have to go and you have to go to the hall of critics every day with the long skirt they have to go exactly so sometimes you cannot even trust yourself right your own thoughts because here's the menu seals are open and he said many people told me that i was not qualified for the job i mean i'm happy that god is not a great democrat god ordains god doesn't ask god ordains amen i mean if god would have asked loud he's here uh my our friend from lao this year who do you want to have as a messenger i mean loud is he would have voted benny hinn oh jimmy swaggart because somebody who is mixing everything a little bit rock music a little bit you stay how you are but jesus loves you but and then he sends a man a small man yeah i mean to show a world that his my his might is is might in in in in us as small persons but he came to that point depressed discouraged now we always make a joke now i know that you are everybody's up but you have a joke i mean even even let me say we have some people in the church that are working outside as farmers that's another thing but let me speak to normal people it's so respectless to start snoring in the church if if if you want to if you really want to hurt a minister you come in with your pillow we see it sometimes in german you know and i'm a translator and then i'm standing at the outside door and people then come oh brother it was a blessing and then i thought by myself what was the did you dream of a mercedes benz or what was the blessing you see i mean can you say amen amen i always tell our young people have you ever seen a minister going to the toilet why why why while there he's preaching so don't go every i just speak to the young elder one sometimes i have their problem that is always with no pro but but we had some time a boy you know he every every so he went to this he went to the toilet you know and one thing is sure if somebody goes to the toilet el all the heads is following that person to understand now there must be a seal revealed behind that door what is what is but i believe there is no much mystery still left you know everything is revealed anyhow but you can distract the people right you're building up a service and it comes to a certain highlight and then and you see how and when it comes to the highlight then all these little things okay satan says okay next time at uh let me say on sunday at 12 30 i'm phoning again they're not for sure because we are we don't have to deal with flesh and blood but it's it's spiritual powers they say amen so these people had power on the prophet that he got discouraged therefore in one certain things let me say this don't let the opinion of people be your own opinion sometimes you go ways that nobody understands and be honest sometimes you don't understand yourself but it has to be in the world don't become odd right don't say the law told me to be divorced and marry somebody who's 30 years younger and i didn't want but you know i must be obeying being and so no no no it must be in the word okay but then you have to go your way and then it's like this then the voice says to brother brahm now that's your life right and i will show you one point which makes things so simple that's your life seven peaks three pulls in between of the seven peaks right right now that makes it like this that's what the voice said to brother branham that's your life and that's your life and that's marcus becker life that's our life therefore i always say this if you are on the peak don't become arrogant don't say i don't know why this family has this promise it seems to be real and they were reaping what they were saying because don't forget the next valley is waiting for you but if you are down in the valley don't give up don't give up because god says the next mountain is waiting already that's your life after the seventh speak the prophet said that was the third pull right was eternity no one man minister comes behind the message of the prophet exactly it cannot be because that you say brother marcus how can you because after that seventh peak there was no more peak right so simple that we all understand because every doctrine which is in the messy which came after brother branham is building a camp upon a person right exactly until you came to come to that point that you have to listen to their tape and brother brandon was his forerunner exactly right so if if i would come one day here say brother friends i am humble but god spoke yesterday to me that brother branham did not tell everything and there is certain things like the seven thunders they have to be revealed and i will preach them to you yeah and if you want to be in the bride you have to all be connected to my home address so to have a further revelation of what brother branham couldn't preach so i hope that you are spiritual and mature enough to to take me yeah put your arms around me amen say brother marcus we love you we will always love you but go home come here come in go home things things that we see partly in this message coming up is demonic it's demonic don't play around with it because when the messenger left the scene he self took over yeah therefore we believe in revelation 10 that christ coming down now i mean i i had on my mind to speak about the different phases of the minister about the brain but just let me give me one clue the last the last ministry that was revealed to the prophet was the eliezer ministry and the message ashamed he said i opened my bible lord showed me one of the ministry he was the seventh and he was the angel to laodicea he had the moses man he had the joshua or he was the prophet elijah all this but they said show me a ministry that was elijah that was the the the ministry of of eliezer end of 1965. now if you see the bible when eliezer comes and he takes the bride and the bride sees isaac you see the bride falls in love with isaac and so the ministry of eliezer the best man is just going back so there where therefore we are very thankful that brother branham is not living anymore amen because if not there would be no church here we would be all connected to jeffersonville nobody would preach nobody would do anything because of so god says we had that ministry but i want the other sons to come in rightness immaturity amen but look at this how people can be good-hearted fine people but have the wrong vision right i mean because some of the people because that isaac for us it's the word brother brandon calls it the entire holy ghost we can call it a capstone we can there's a lot of things that we can call it but there's too much people they are not marrying the world but they want to marry eliezer can you say man i'm in there one day fall in love with eliezer but elijah said now that is your husband not me they want brother brent speak up all the good times when the prophet was there i want to say there there's a greater than solomon is here today therefore he will not come back because his eliezer ministry is over he will not come back right because he is here and we think it's certainly different than denominations and not going into fanaticism because we will meet him in the air at the same time we believe in balance and you say amen but look the last part of his life the third pull and then it went directly into eternity if somebody comes up brother marcus super movement in the message and you know like in the days of brother branham and we have this i mean you can stay cool you can say is it a world we rival or is it just a denominational charismatic revival upon a man you know exactly god does a word revival in our day make the next one please i'm just hurrying through right i mean next one no going back to this okay i'm just hiring in that way last one yeah now that's a prophet i mean this is 1963 the end of the year he comes the storm and comes down and here is the three deers they stood there a little while walked across to eat over my hand always turned around and looked at me like that and walked on and off and stand and looked again walked right out of the woods and i was standing i thought that's unusual for dear wonder if it's because the lord jesus is here his presence and just then a voice spoke to me you remember your promise didn't you i knew it was him i said yes lord now you understand why all these events are important to put them in a certain order because brother bram said in this message i was weary for many years i had a burden i went to the ocean i went into the and nothing satisfied me that was in october november 1963 the opening of or the the message flashing red sign was in i think it was april or may 1964 63. in that service brother vay turned dead fell down dead people who were there gave their testimony that brother when brother way fell down that's just the way she's a nurse she looked at him and brother blame came from the pulp in his direction and since the weight said brother blame he's he's dead his eyes turned back and brother brain said something again which is gold god never forgets he said sister ray you are a nurse you had compassions with others now god has compassion with you you you get you you you get what you in a positive way it it matters to serve the law god god pays it back in wonderful ways but what happens here is a man raising up from the dead but the burden never left the prophet right right exactly exactly you can have every weekend signs and miracles whatever it will never solve your problem they are fine we love them we want to have more but this is not the answer on the challenge today the answer was the voice of god speaking to him he said so i do remember mine i will never leave you i will never forsake you that burden lifted christian friends it hasn't been back since that was last october i have been a different person keep your promise to god whatever you say to god you believe it separate yourself from anything contrary to the word god will hear and answer prayer let us bow our heads the raising up of the dead did not lift the burden of the prophet but when he heard his voice brother marx we need a new minister who comes up with the same gifts of the prophet the power lays in the spoken words hallelujah brother marcus uh we have to go to a certain convention one time in a year um and and in that conde convention we get rapturing faith and and and if if if you're not there you i said this is a very blessed doctrine right you know who's everybody blessed with this delta airlines american airways they love this kind of of doctrines because you have to go to a certain point to receive something but the brides she receives it from the words and then you can go from convention to convention but you understand i need to hear his voice to my heart and then you have conference with god hallelujah actually last one because i'm i'm harry and sue amen amen now israel why is god so thought and cared so much about that little place of palestine when it's just a little spot but right there is where the temple sets in that's where the new jerusalem will break right there olive mountain shall cleave part the right left shoulder when she pushes up from beneath now look at this the parallel because in the same night when israel was formed to be a nation the angel came to the prophet right look at this no civilization that was ever destroyed ever came back right right never you take the greeks you take the romans you take the meters the persians the babylonians you take the maya you take the at sticks you take the chinese you take every civilization that one time was destroyed it never came back again small dispersed but god is with them calls them after 2 000 years right on the same spot from where they belonged even theodore herzl wanted to put them to argentina or to uganda to put a place for the jews but god said i will remember my promise amen and look at this and how how wonderful that is we love the luther reformation the luther revival we love the pentecost revival in the azusa way street but one time a revival burns down according to the word of the prophet it never comes back again it never comes that's what the prophet says there is only one thing that comes back it's the word of the lord which was in the beginning comes back at the end i mean amen right god doesn't go back not even in the pentecostal move as we had a hundred years ago god goes forward god goes forward this is promised land time this is new a new dispensation of time coming i told the brother you have sometimes movements in the message and they start up and they crumble down everything that man started will be finished right at latest when the founder dies because it was his idea to collect people around his idea but when he dies everything will crop the only thing which will never die is the word of the lord because it's eternal amen therefore that sister says i prefer to be in the word than in heaven and i think even brother brain said how that and that sister said because heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away i think this was the last just let me finish that story i mean can you say amen we are 35 at 45 i'm through the lord is winning can you say amen according to my to my promise but it's just wonderful to share these thoughts to understand no matter where you are today you can be blessed by the right action but the right attitude and no matter how down you are today exactly god is not nervous about that condition because when he called you he saw all the way until the rapture and we have to understand that if we want to make it we have to have the right energy drink to eat the message of the hour and these cakes will bring us unto the holy mountain of the lord this time mount zion that little boy died when he was around 12 years old and that woman was settling the moon to go to the prophet elijah now the death of the little boy was hit to the prophet do you think that the prophet can be fooled it can be you know i think it was jacob he was even fooling his own father or right even brother brandon had a story where somebody says i need tires i'm a minister from stones and brother brahms says later he was a complete lie i gave him the money and then exactly so god allows many things god allows those things so he sends gehasi ask that wife what's wrong with her and she arrives and guess he said it's all well with your child all well and she said all as well brother said the little little one lays dead and she's at all as well what does it mean god is in control about everything so she came to the prophet he says uh now you promised me that son and now he's dead so you have to do something with it so god says so the prophet elijah says okay i will send a little gift some penty cost a blessing okay you have a little staff and uh gerhard you laid on the boy you know i hope i say the right thing we love gifts i wish i would have more gifts but gifts doesn't give you eternal life gifts help you that's fine but eternal life comes by the word by the spoken word exactly so sometimes you have more gifts and you have more confusion right so he sends a gift and lays it upon the dead child you know gifts are wonderful but gifts doesn't bring life not even today gifts can impress my speak life doesn't come from speaking in tongues life comes by the spoken word comes and says maya i tried everything he goes to the prophet said prophet you have to go yourself right whenever it becomes important for god he comes personally he doesn't set an angel i i just give you a little illustration here were those three boys in the fiery furnace and they went into it god is able to deliver us and god was just standing with his angel i make a little little not to be respected but just to make a little illustration and brother blame says and the first angel comes woolworths boomers let me go down i will go i was destroyed with fire and brother blame said god said i have to calm down myself because here is my children and he was the fourth man in that whenever it becomes important god comes down personally earlier take it to revelation 10 not into fanaticism but taking the time there is a time like never was before this is more than pentecost we loved it but this is more than this hallelujah now ty now that that that prophet elijah with the lord himself so he comes down personally and he goes in that room and he closes the door now this is just an illustration i might be wrong on this but just an illustration now tie this to the tent vision that the prophet had i mean to the little room right where people went in and exactly and came out amen now he was just i mean and he was there now outside the people because these people were charismatic they thought if god works it has to be loud it has to be emotional it i have to feel something but god does great things in silence so they were just telling him did you hear anything with nothing it was not in jesus name no no no no no no no no no but what he did then because brother abraham said it is the servants is so much in silence right he closed the door and laid himself upon the boy by healing in a special way right right and when he laid himself upon this look his nose became his nose his mouth became his mouth his mind became his mind and he was laying long enough upon the boy he began to sneeze seven times it was not a great healing gift that came but it was the person himself laying himself upon his bride his dead bride denominational dead bride laying it himself right i mean the rest outside did not see what happened inside but what god is doing today will not be a public show anyhow it is a platform time is over to invite somebody was especially to stir the people this is time to enter into the holy of holy with him personally so life was transmitted i mean and these were they heard nothing people say today i mean the message is silence is a little bit dead i always say it's that for you because the bride is in a revival like never before like never be this is another form than pentecostal this is hearts revive this is the word manifested in us but it's a process it takes time maybe one of them one of the servants called in elijah what are you doing we hear nothing and elijah said you cannot teach pentecost and baby supernatural things that is laying upon him and now let me finish by the last i'm going in time i'm in all right look the time that we live amen loud is here because god builds up a bride pentecostal age speaking in tongues great time we thank god i time god send the prophet the eyes now is the if if you have a head like this only till here i mean something is missing intelligence time the mind of christ let me pass something if the mind of christ that's the supernatural part today and you cannot make bodybuilding here it's silent but great things are going in these little heads there's not much in it be sure but the little brain which is in it there's many things that's going in so god is in a stage today where people think nothing happens and you could say this is the greatest time for the bride hey say amen god remembers yes hallelujah pastor dave you will pray with us hallelujah god bless you it was a pleasure to speak to you right amen thank you very much thank you very much can you say amen let's give our brother a good man we believe it though because we believe in a very positive attitude very positive attitude because that's where we put it right amen so you tell our brother how much you appreciate it we appreciate him him coming and speaking for us and pray that the lord will bless him as he travels on up the highway tomorrow and night and all like that then when he comes back to maybe he'll have us some books we can pass them around and tapes because they got the videos to see and all of that so we appreciate it amen all right so what do we got let's just sing okay if anybody has a need the altar is open there's a blessed time that's coming coming soon it may we shall see the king when he comes we shall see the king we shall see the king he believe it i believe we're seeing the king by the revealed word don't you man in the name of the lord jesus christ you're the see the winner we need to leave it's your night this remembers your time listen to it you don't want to turn it away we shall see the king we shall see the king do you believe it being in power anybody else we shall see the key we you've heard shall great message i believe it so now come and reap the benefits it may be evening morning all right we shall see anybody else in japanese did he that would mess up things wouldn't it he'd have two bodies and he don't need that but we meet him in the air right we shall see we shall see the king when one thing god is doing something around the world amen you're right i've always told you that if he's doing anything here he's doing around the world right well you know what i believe our brother come from germany that's right to let us know about it don't you right god's working living in a positive attitude believing in a right in a people that are getting ready right everything else is just depressing right exactly pushing down but that don't have anything to do with the bride of christ no exactly so absolutely so you know what your prophet said god's waiting on the people right to call him on the scene right yes yeah that's true he's waiting on the people to call him right so then it's up up to you and i am right right amen yes father that's true just bless us that you know just pray that the lord will bless our brothers as he travels on and bring in the word and the things and doing and all of his work that he's doing there and things and we pray that the lord would bless all it right just remember pray one for another remember brother alex mother we know sunday i believe saturday she fell and we prayed about it our sunday and i hadn't heard anything about how she's doing but we pray she's doing all right that the lord take care of her and all that so yeah all right anything else before we go is anybody going to the fellowship meeting all right brother ryan them's going i was just going to kind of get a little goal all right about how many he's coming because i got to call him and tell him that we're not going to be able to come because i'm not going to my wife i'm not going to i'm not going to go without her and i'm not going to put her that far okay so we'll have tell them we'll have at least probably 10 to represent out of here that'll be coming all right and that'll let them
