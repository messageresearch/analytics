wants to get baptized remember we we're already I mean we're always in that line of loving to baptize and things and to do so if you see that remember that we are having that okay is that all the announcements I think that's about it so let's pray read our scripture and go right on in to the comments and questions Lord Jesus we thank you for the opportunity to be able to stand before a congregation and to be able to speak about things Lord that we don't know everything we don't claim to but we sure are a whole lot better off than what we used to be because we do have some answers maybe to some of the things and then those things that are unanswerable we'll that'll take care of that later we just ask you to help us and guide each one of us that we may speak about you because you are the one and only one that can answer any question in the mind and hearts of mankind forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace and love and let your light shine in each one of our hearts in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 verse 12 and I turn to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like UND defined Bry as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters all right now let's go over to Peter because this will just be more or less a relating to uh all of the point in relation of questions so we wanted to read this second Peter 1 Simon Peter a servant and Apostle Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises Prophet would be saying what these promises that by these these promises of what he's promised to come you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we'll just come in a little to line up our thoughts and then we will have open discussion open questions as to the things that we've been talking about and you know I you know me I love questions brother random said one day questions makes a strong Church you know you ponder about that you say well questions makes a strong Church well may I rephrase that without it being any interpretation or thought wrong questions that are answered is what makes a strong church now even questions that are asked does let the pastor or the person know a little bit about what is on the mind of the people all right so then it's uh you know it's to that point all right now we have come to the place in the message of talking about the new birth and what takes place and we're talking about that the new birth is the the birth of the word and the reason that we need to be born again is the fact that Adam and Eve sold us out in the garden and put us into a position driven out of the garden bringing us into a place that we talk about and call Satan's domain which is the world and the things all right then we went through covering that as God saw we needed that well I mean saw that we were coming well he knew it that he would be begin to condescend downward into an Earthly existence if you want to use it in that form coming from the supernatural down into the natural form that we speak of when he came into Earth all right he's done so that we could have the right to the new birth and become uh the children of God everyone must have the new birth that is in the body of Christ you've got to have that to be in the body of Christ all right and remember that it has been the same in every age the New Birth has it's always been the birth of the word no matter what age it was Luther's just shall live by faith it was the birth of the word all right and that the evidence has always been the same for every age all right not the uh you know the doings we may have different thoughts and ideas about about uh some of the things but remember it's got to come back to the point that the evidence is the same in every age because if it's a birth of the word it's a birth of the word in every age and it comes to that the new birth being the birth of the word that is made Alive by the coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the soul of God changed to a form to be able to unite with you and I in our soul to where that our soul could be made Eternal right all right then bringing it to that position then we can start by the opening of the word to be able to climbing upwardly as the word is being revealed to us it will build into those virtues we speak of Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience will come into being by the opening of the word until it will bring us to a complete birth of the word and that's what this age is to bring each one of the ages had their part all right but this age must come to the fullness of the birth of the word and if Luther was to have the birth of justification wesle sanctification Pentecostal baptism we have to have the birth of the entire word of God to be able to bring us to a place as I was saying this morning if we are waiting for a bus to pull up at least we've come through that line we are getting to the point of bringing the bus into being because we're getting to where that we would be ready for whatever that you would think would be coming or whatever is to take place I have my own thoughts on that and I fully believe that one day when the head and body units that as brother randam would say there'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll fill every fiber of our being and take us into Rapture all right so you know I'm looking for something to happen but I'm not sitting still not looking at the things that are being are taking place among us because then we must look at that through that all right where is the revealing then of the word it's not in the head because you know you call it Spirit realm or brain and all of those things it doesn't make no difference the revealing of the word is not aead knowledge if if it was then why would you need where would put knowledge in the pyramid see that's definitely not our knowledge it has to be his knowledge all right so that's the opening of the word I had some quotes this morning like where brother Bram says on the uh perfect Faith he says you become the word as you receive the word all right so if we're talking about building a word body then it was necessary that God send us the word to be able to you know come into that place all right so he's taken care of that sending us the profit of the of the age and letting us come into that being all right now we talked about it ending this morning that when we were born into the world in Satan's domain that the nature of our soul our being that we are was into that Realm Of Satan and it would be that way and it would be pulling us downward no matter what the baby is and how good of a family it's in mama don't lie daddy don't lie no lies around it it still winds up being a liar it's just it's just part of what we are because it's the domain that we're in of Satan the the realm we're in all right that's the undercurrent carrying us down that if we die in that stage that we will just what when death takes a place it's not that you are are going or whatever you're doing you just step out of this body right right you don't have to step into another body you step out of this body all right once you step out of this Physical Realm then you're automatically already that body which is the soul of the individual all right but if you're born again see that's a downward current but if you're born again when you're born again you heard from your theophany you started an upward pulling up going up the stature of a perfect man adding Faith to Virtue to knowledge to temper Place coming to the positive of the word of God Amen this is the only age that can come to that maturity the way that was to be now we believe the disciples had the virtues right but they did not have the headstone that's why your Prophet said it he said it hadn't come yet all right so then it means somewhere in the end time somebody's got to find a reality of what's taking place here it's not what's going to be in heaven we're not doing that it's it's the point of seeing eternal life here as it dwells in a individual by the new birth to make our soul Eternal because it started off as a pattern as to Adam and Eve in that God started that with Adam and Eve in the garden full grown and with eternal Souls right all right because they had eternal life all right then their soul would be called their theophany and brother Ram said e was in Adam in theophany that's right all right said Adam wasn't satisfied or complete when it was when he come into flesh he said because part of his being was still in theophine all right so now get my point they are they entered their theophany it was there that was their soul all right but see then we want to think that our theophany is up under under somewhere and we're here going going through all of this to finally get up to there well Adam and Eve didn't have to come that way right when God breathed eternal life into the nostrils of Adam that was the Genesis 1 126 man right right and it says let us make man all right so whatever image God was in that's the image we're in right whatever image we're in that's the image God was in or you got something wrong with with your terminology all right then as the word is revealed to you and I we go from a part think you know way of speaking from partial realization coming to the perfect realization of that that's being revealed am all right so this was the end time the great day to where that we could see about Redemption the old days we looked at Redemption as going up to heaven you know one of these days we'll be redeemed we'll get out of this world we're going to get us a new body cuz we don't need this and all of that well we've got away from that by the opening of the word are supposed to have all right that would bring us to the position to where that we would realize eternal life here that's what I told you that was the thing that caught me more than anything in the world brother Mo began to tell me about the things I said listen I believe you you've seen the dead rais you've seen the sick heill that's all right now this is the words that I give him I said that's all right I believe you he referred he said you know brother Tatum you know and back then we knew each other in the bases that you know we knew that Tatum family and are wonderful persons and all and he said now he's seen all these things I said well and good I said but I've not I've not seen him so what you're saying to me is wonderful but I I'm not one that could see that and say that I believe he was a prophet but I said you tell me what he taught in the word or from the word you know bringing it and I said I'll know whether he was a prophet or not because I did always believe one thing the word come to the prophet I didn't understand that like we do now but I believe that they spoke in their day as God personal to each one of them I saw that in the Baptist Church I could see and realize those things you know back there all right and see when he said okay we won't deal no more about whether brother random was a prophet or not we'll deal with what he said some of us were discussing something there at lunch and I told him I said you know there's a lot of people believe that brother brandham was the one that come to John on patmas whether you believe that or not that's up to you I ain't going to argue with you but they believe that all right but I said wouldn't it be something for you to walk up to a center out on the street and you're trying to win him to God and you walk out there to him and you say we believe God sent a prophet and he's the one that come to John on Patman what a person don't even know what in the world you're talking about but that's supposed to convert people to the message I know what it convert me to it'd convert me turning around going the other way cuz I think I done run into a bunch of Cs but bring me the word here that's one that I talked two years ago and for a long time we talked about God and not real and what the word said and we got it to the bases I said okay now brother dick what do you believe he said okay I don't believe that anymore about the three person he said I believe that it's three manifestations I said okay I let him talk to me all right then I told him I said okay now if it's three manifestation and not three Gods now no more and not one this now but God do I said what about this water baptism and he said what do you mean because see I didn't know he had been pondering those things in his mind I said what you know he said what do you mean I said well what about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well see I had laid it down to where that if he was going to argue about Father Son and Holy Ghost then he didn't believe in his three manifestation he was still trinitarian so give people the word and then let them come to the other things you know God sent a prophet all these things that's wonderful but give them the word first and let them see what it is because once they see the word being revealed they can't argue about the other things okay we went through covering even how that the opening of the word would bring us as I said from partial realization to perfect we even talked about Ezekiel and how that through the prophit that breathed upon those that were standing there that had the the skin had the the things you know the bones and all but it took the breath to come and how that this end time message then would be the point that it would be that God is using the word to bring us to the place that we're supposed to be and I'm a firm believer that the message of the hour is that word of God that was to be brought that mankind knew of certain things and even the Great Apostle Paul and them that knew of a lot more than we think about us yet still they were left with questions in their mind and could only deal with prophecies and things of future events but you and I are no longer in the day of dealing with prophecies we are in the days when the prophecies are being made manifest right right you go back and listen to the prophecy even in the 50s and then you get a newspaper and read it he'd say it like this he said they're going totally insane out on the streets and then you get in the car and drive down the road you say prophecy fulfilled here comes another one you know cuz everything is going that way all right thank God for the truth that's allowed us to understand the word of the hour you know to bring us to that place to where that God will be able to move Among Us and you say I just don't see anything going on well may I state it this way as I said about a doctor the other day that a doctor friend of mine he said he was asked by the doctor said how can you believe in healing and and you knowing whats you know about medical science he said he turned around to the man and said well how can you believe in medical science' how can you you not believe it you know when your your your medical science teaches you that there's a God because it's showing that you know the the inwards and outwards the making of This human body it was explained well see that's what I'm saying that I believe you say I don't see anything going on why not but you say but but we're just not having the signs and wonders there's none of us supposed to have signs and wonders like brother around him had a nobody ever said anything like that I believe though and I've taught you and believe it that around the world today the ministry of Jesus Christ is in the Bride of Jesus Christ amen now if you tell me that ain't true I'm going to ask you about Hebrews 13:8 right see you're going to make it great here long here great here greater here something wrong you're going to make it I believe even in the days of Martin Luther you go back and study they had great signs and wonders taking place cuz it always been Supernatural where the Supernatural is at no matter what age and see the reason we don't see a lot of things we don't believe it that's right amen right we don't believe in ourselves that's right so right then am I going to blame you because it's and say well I don't see you do like one man said he told this other one one day said you ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing well you know what that'd be two nothings I guess you'd have so the best thing to do on that would just be get out of the way and this was a preacher and he was talking to a preacher so I think them two preachers ought to shut up and sit down and get out of the way cuz I see and believe God is revealing himself and doing things among us and I believe it okay now that gets me to where that I Matt to telling you that I believe the supernatural God is here may I quote your prophet he said outside of the body of Jesus Christ he's here just like he was now you say I don't see that well then you're the one that's blind you're doubting your own words of your Prophet that was said well it's going to happen one of these days well when is that going to be I mean what am I supposed to do you know sit down and wait no we keep on going all right but now let's get into the questions and answers what about you what do you think about the day that we're living in the times and things I've got a couple to uh relate to and I'll read this and a lot of it is comment but I'll read it and try the best to answer that and you get ready and we'll have the the others that are are there all right so the person wrote said this is three thoughts talking about Spirit five senses memory reason conscious affections Etc say your personality consists of both spirit and soul I agree with that because I believe your your spirit displays what's in your soul all right so whatever you use consense of whatever that would would do you're spirit will do from whatever is within sight the only thing I hold with that line is Satan can enter that Spirit until he can make that Spirit be contrary to what is within the soul I believe that now I believe he's got that Inlet to where that he can can do it all right but consisting yes because your spirit displays what's in your soul all right it says separating them sounds like your personality is going back to God well what I saying this morning you know about the things the your personality let's separate that a little bit because my point of what I was talking about this morning was that hey and I've got two hours 5:00 okay no but the your personality is is what you are right amen connecting your body your spirit your soul together that is a personality that's a person that's what you are all right all of those things but the spirit who goes back to God would not be the wrong personality no way could you take that back you could count it as the good parts of you and okay that'll be all right as long as you're holding it to the right thoughts because you know what we spend so much talking about the bad thoughts you know what you hear very little said about the good thoughts right that's right how many sits around and say now I had a good thought the no I had a bad thought the other day that's why we oh we talk about the bad some pointing at each other now so they must have talked about these things but all right it is the truth is it why can't we talk about the good thoughts as we were talking last night in the Bible study I believe when we get to heaven we can remember what happened here I mean even the wrong things it would happen but it won't be remembered as wrong things if we remember what happens in this world would not we remember the good and the bad but take away the bad you know let's see can I get the scripture and like a woman having a baby that when the child is born all the things are pass about that right well wouldn't it be that way in heaven that we could remember these things in life and doings and and said you know that was pretty bad then but said now I life about it see that would be your personality that would be your your doings all right then they went on to say that in the genetic C in personalities you know they're passed down through generations and I agree with that you know you see somebody say they're acting just like Grandpa maybe they never seen grandpa but they're acted like them you know because it's just traits and and genetic parts that happen that comes through that way and and certain things are the same way that you'd see it in grandfather say is that based on the spirit or the body or both well it would to me it would be in both because you're connecting together that if I act like Grandpa then my body's got to be involved but a motivated by something else inside and uh you know and and I'm H us to believe one thing your soul being the real you but still that Soul has the uh it is you but you have a nature in ways that wouldn't always be just the body or the spirit it would be the soul because as I tried to teach you through the message that it took 75 years to God get to my soul like it is what would you be if You' have stopped when I was about 40 30 I would have never heard of this message so I'm I believe it still the nature is being made through God's nature but also life itself you know it is learning to do those things all right but see I look at it as you being Body Spirit and soul a person amen my soul is what I really am the spirit that's within me is me and it's manifest me and my body just makes manifest what I am within right so I'm a triun being in to make those manifest and I may in that triun being act like my grandfather because maybe he was in that realm I like to think about my dad in this much I I never knew my dad because he he passed away when I was about some somewhere around 4 years of age and uh I can't remember that I think about brother Bram saying first thing he remember was a vision 18 months old would remember he was a prophet and God had him made that way cuz I I can't remember my daddy and he was I was somewhere in the neighborhood of four years of age see maybe some of you say well I can remember when I was two years old well that's all right I can't the first thing I remember about my after my dad died was leading a horse out in the backyard and pulling it in the holding it and me stoning in a tire that I can remember that and I can remember that Daddy had some chew debaca and I already had the denty but I got a hold of Daddy's CH de backer and I go down to the barn and boy I had me a time as a little boy and about that time it went to go both ways and I can remember crawling back to the house I can remember the only thing I remember in house laying on that bed and looking at everything going around I was a sick little boy but okay now listen I believe that genetic traits are pass down I said something the other day maybe you hadn't considered but why is it that you go so long and you wind up somebody looks like great great great Granda well you know they used to I used to think well that's okay but but you know I got to thinking about if we all come from Adam and Eve you know and I know the Beast and what just point but you know that we'd all have the original DNA do you know that after the flood you only had the DNA of Noah right right sure now you can have the wise coming down from this and the men coming down but get my point a no problem to me to find out that there was somebody back under 10 Generations that looked identical to me because that would be just be part of the genetics but I also remember one other thing brother brandham said maybe it was your Gra grandmother something like that now if I get it wrong you said it prayed for you well how did your great grandmother pray for you she was just praying about being a Christian but she was asking God to bless her genealogy you know the offspring that would come we don't think about that do we all right anyhow going on So to that clarify maybe to the person if it don't then they can ask me more questions and uh this one is going to take about 45 minutes I don't mean that wrongly now but it says based on what brother brandham said now you got to listen our diagram of the pyramid is wrong being that the seventh the Holy Ghost is the seventh age messenger brother brandham message is the Capstone all right granted the Holy Ghost is revealed revealed Holy Ghost revealed each age message now in other words we believe it but here's something that I believe needs to be thought of we look at the pyramid and we try to figure it out and we get it down and see you want to put Elijah as a messenger to the seventh Church age and all right we believe that we believe that is being truth and I believe the message he brought is The Headstone to the church Capstone whatever because number one remember brother Brown's message was not from 40 or 33 when he would be down there you'd call him under Ohio River 30 something up to 63 that wasn't brother Brown's message that was the Bible it was his part or part of his ministry to take up those loose ends and bring it out to where it was supposed to be but Paul and them had already preached the faith of the fathers they had already preached the statute of perfect man they already brought those things that wasn't brother Brown's message I'm trying to lay down a point for you to think of see brother Brown's message begun in the seals his message that's what he says in the Rapture book he said not in the years of preparation but said when he begin to sound his message so now you got to bring brother Brown's message then up from isusa Street and bring it out in the end time but you got to let it tie together with a zeusa street y all right now that's where I got into it years ago trying to explain it and people don't want to listen to you about it but I'll open for you to explain it so then there eight manifestations of God in the seven Church ages amen but there's only seven Messengers amen there's eight manifestations of God right amen but now watch there's only seven ads now I can give you the quote off of that if you like it there's only seven ads there's not eight ads we're not into some strange Doctrine issue we're in a truth amen faith is not an adding faith is a birth that's right amen it doesn't say add Faith the prophet said have faith and be born again and then you add to your faith virtue now is that what we read in the Bible right faith is not faith is a birth right it's the new birth Faith amen all right so if you take that look what you've got faith as being the new birth you add virtue there's one knowledge two Temperance three patience four godl is five brotherly kindness six headstone is seven you okay you bring it the way the prophet talked it seven ads the new birth is not an ad it is the birth itself you have to to how that before you can talk about something being added no and bringing it to the place to understand look what your Prophet had to say all right let me get this over here so go ahead brothers and pull up I gave him a couple of quotes and let's read it from the first seal let's read what your Prophet had to say he said we found in the studies of the scriptures scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time Paul came or come at the end of the age all right now we got Paul down here on the bottom where did he come into being at what it come to the End of the Age end of what age if he come to the End of the Age how did he bring the message to Ephesus well he just come to end of the age and brought it real quick no no no no that that that won't that don't work it come at the End of the Age end of what age if he come at the end of the age as your mind is doing look what you got where did he come at the end of the age well let's let brother brandham say it where we can back up and then you'll understand what he's getting at Paul come at the End of the Age we find out that irenius come at the End of the Age Martin End of the Age right now you're going to tie it together Luther the end of the Catholic age now you going to bring Luther at the end of the age or you going to bring him here and let him bring the message to the age which way you do let's let brother random answer it Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age right okay Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification through baptism of the Holy Ghost that requires you to stop and think every messenger come at the end of the age did Brother brandham come at the End of the Age of Wesley or did he come at the End of the Age of Lady OA right which one all right let's let him answer his own question at the End of the Age Pentecost got the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive end of the Pentecostal age according to the word as God helped me to to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all of those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church do you believe that was brother bram's Ministry I do that's why I believe he come to the end of the age he come at the end of lady oia not at the begin beginning of Lady here so you follow so you can argue about the beginnings of where we started talking about Paul at the End of the Age I ran at the end of the but when brother Randon says Luther the end of the Catholic age now what did he say Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification and it's supposed to be a messenger come down here at the end of Pentecost so you got to get things in the correct order or you're out of line let's read the next one and let him answer it this is questions and answers on the seals 63 go ahead and pull it up you see each one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit look that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet that wouldn't brother brandom you say how do you know cuz he said it wasn't all right that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age right what because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism right now that makes me sick when I remember how people Tau about Pentecost as being false and Pentecost is not being real I'm talking about zeusa Street when brother randam said it's the baptism it is what the holy ghost coming himself in the fullness of the baptism but at the end of the ages always ends upon the other we find there the messenger sent and all these Scruples and things to be placed in their places like that then the Rapture comes to the church amen so then there eight manifestations of God Amen there's only seven Church ages but there's only seven manifestation of age Messengers because when the Holy Ghost came himself on a zeusa street he used the oneeyed black man to bring a message that's quoting brother BR but he's not counted in the ages so the drawing is Right amen it's just our understanding of the drawing right that's messed up right because looking at the drawing what do we see when the day of Pentecost was coming to an end Paul come comes on the scene end of Pentecost when Paul's message is going out arenus comes on the scene cuz each one of them brings a message to the age then as the the brother R called it the Catholic age coming to an end Martin Luther comes on the scene the messenger always comes at the end of the age but make sure you get it right so Paul didn't come right here in the age call Paul come into the prior part before go to irus Martin go to how can you prove it because Luther comes at the end of the Catholic G Wesley where did he come at the end of Luther's age now you cannot put the burst and the time of the church age Messengers within what you're thinking you can't do that anyway because some of them were born real early some of were born real late of the age I'll tell you that in case you want to go look up the dates in the times of the messengers to save you a lot of trouble I openly Proclaim that every messenger was not to coming down right down at the end dead end and things but then I openly proclaimed that that was the end of the age when another messenger steps on the scene you've ended your prior age so when Luther come on the scene the Catholics and all of that it was gone he said we know to do a c that's where you're wonderful in your thinking India would really argue with brother brandom when he said the church started out as Catholic right he said they were the original Catholic and he said I'm the original Catholic amen not Roman Catholic means Universal but do you understand what I'm meaning see then you bring it correctly then you got Paul irenius Columbo Martin and Columbo Luther Wesley Elijah but you got a split part in here you've got the holy ghost coming right here on isusa Street this holy ghost covers all of this right that's why it says holy spirit brother R said those disciples had these virtues but he said he didn't have the headstone so the disciples was right to the place of what Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost come on the day of of zeusa Street in the gifts and the Wonders and the things that were happening until like we were quoting the other night where brother Brown said he said die for just a little while after that ofus he said they were more ready for the Rapture than we are you ever heard him say it like that more ready than we are what you mean ready than we are they all trinitarian he was talking about the spirit among the people the love the joy the things of God the moving of the Holy Spirit among the people that were yes trinitarians and teaching a trinity and God's still coming down and doing great wonders and signs among them he's not talking about the word that's revealed because that's what he's covering here the messenger comes the end of the age to bring the message to the next age now watch if you jumped up real quick where would you go if you pulled Elijah up here trying to connect in there to the way that we look at it a lot of time what are you saying I thought brother R said the Elijah of this day is who I thought he said the Elijah this day is the Lord Jesus Christ now what is it is it 464 seal book what it where it says another great prophet which is not talking about brother brandham ausa Street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet of God not the messenger of Malachi 4 that was to come at the end of his Street the end of lady oia because this messenger is to come what is the messenger to do he rebukes the previous age and he brings his message brother brandham come to rebuke the zeusa street Pentecost Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and all you don't pay close attention to what brother randam was say you know that he said we know the Baptist is two or three hund years back before us right and brother randam said one day he said the Baptist is just now become a denomination you know when they become a denomination when they turn him down in his message when they turn the message down for this age they become a denomination how much more is it today when the people are turning down the message right well you see what I'm talking about there only seven Messengers men named as seven Messengers Paul irus stars is Paul irus Columba Martin Luther Wesley and Elijah so the Elijah this day being the Lord Jesus Christ when that isusa street happened that's why it tees me up for people to say that they say brother Randon was wrong in his early Ministry but the son of man comes straightened him out now I'd like for that to be explained it would no son of man come and straighten him out he was right or the son of man wouldn't have come on the scene you said well he he didn't know about right he didn't know about the white horse rider but neither did anybody else neither did anybody in the world know about it until the seals broke to the prophet even though who was it what's his name it slip from it uh the one that taught white horse rider Lin Clarence Lin Clarence Lin taught the white horse rider was was the Antichrist way before brother Brandon but he was no Messenger to the age that was the Holy go speaking through and working through gifts and different things but it was not the messenger of Malachi 4 so you see what I'm talking about you got the holy ghost coming himself on the de of zeusa street but then at the End of the Age The Prophet comes on the scene to tie up all the loose sins this was the angel the star of all things the messenger to bring all of the loose ends together and tie up bring it together and bring the word for the Rapture that's why I quote it a lot to you he says on the Rapture mess it has been spoken now let it come to pass if he hadn't said it could it ever come to pass I don't look at R R's message as an addition to the Bible no sir re m- it was what the whole Bible was talking about brought into reality we see then you don't have to change the drawings correct we just change our understanding and the key is to see that the messenger comes at the end of the age but the key to see is the Holy Ghost came himself on zusa street that Holy Ghost just moved right on over into what did he say Smith Wigglesworth which one of them died in 24 hours later he was on this on the field the holy ghost that was in them people moved right on through him brother Rams had now you ain't going to like this I know L other people don't like me to talk but brother had the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost on theusa Street Pentecost I don't have no problem saying that the baptism of the Holy Ghost they fell on a zeusa street I can quote the prophet was exactly like the book of Acts now that's what he said am exactly like the day of Pentecost but now you got to to explain that because here you've got the Holy Ghost falling on the day of Pentecost in the upper room on 120 that stood at the faith of the fathers you got 3,000 outside just heard one sermon ain't saying they didn't know about a lot of things heard one sermon and receive the Holy Ghost everybody that gets the baptism of the Holy Ghost get the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost or else you didn't get it CU that way you can separate it then and see that 120 of them was at the faith of the fathers but the 3,000 were just born babies that's why you don't have a noice writing the word you don't do that you got those that had the faith to tell you what the faith was right you see that that's people don't consider that point to thing about if you say that the Holy Ghost you got is the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost I'll say Amen but now make sure you're explaining the difference in the upper room is 120 compared to the 3,000 outside because there's a vast difference between the two it was not those that were out there outside that wrote the word it was not out of the 3,000 that they wrote the word it was out of the upper room experience and those that they taught of their own experience Timothy wrote I wouldn't say I wouldn't argue with you I don't believe Timothy probably wouldn't in the upper room but he sat under Paul and was taught the word of God in his Clarity and then he knew what to take place but you understand what I'm saying you don't have to change the pyramid you know the doctor you the thought you leave it but you get the understanding of the Holy Ghost coming at the end of the eight and right there is where Paul came into being right here at the bottom irus Martin Columbus Luther Wesley Pentecost brother brandham to bring us the message you ever noticed in the Bible that it was the prophet's words that changed things the prophet the message he brought opened to mankind God for that age and that time this messenger go back and study how that the messenger come at the end of the age but study it like this no Messenger to the age the Holy Ghost came himself then just let that Holy Ghost just come right on over into the prophet he had to have the Holy Ghost he was born a prophet but he had to have the Holy Ghost now he was the one that said that not me did he receive the new birth all right go back in the Old Testament and study it how that you sound a trumpet and that trumpet as it sounds to the the people might have set them free or bound them one of the two yeah this message will either set you free or it'll bind you one of the two it will it'll bind you back to your old doctr or ideas run you to it or it'll set you free what do you think about it anybody got any comments on what I've said so far all right oh where Bob Ryan okay brother Bob's got the thing back there we going got a few comments questions first off I want to say I really appreciate what you preached about the uh Soul and Spirit how that it develops and that shed a lot of light on that for me because uh I didn't even realize it but I always thought that when we're born born a natural birth we receive a fully developed Soul and Spirit and we just kind of grow into it and I never really considered that your soul and spirit have to develop but that actually opened a lot of light on a lot of things for me as I dwelt on that for the next few weeks after you first mentioned it and uh I thought of a few things that support that and uh Proverbs 22:6 train up a child and the way he should go um that's one of the things I thought of it supports what you're saying because you know when we're born you know at that age like Catholics say give us a child until they're five and we'll have them you know the rest of their life and well unless God intervenes you know right but um they as children at that age were very very tender and fragile and and can really be U you know LED one way or another right because of that Soul not being developed yet in spirit and all brother brandom also said after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food you left the other thing you have been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theop exactly and also I I don't know if he made this comment but I've heard it here a lot and I believe it that our theophany is being built around our Born Again experience and I wrote down here that I conclude then that after we are saved God leads us in a path that will mold our character and thus our soul into that theophan body M so you preached the matching pieces series also back in 93 I think um God is making our soul match our theophany would that be right making our our soul bring the word yeah so he's making it match what he saw in heaven he's making what's here match what's there exactly and then the scriptures also the footsteps of the righteous are order of the of the Lord that's another one that supports that and all things work together for good to them that love God m mhm um I had one question about it though death only changes our dwelling place right right it doesn't change anything of what we are so then uh if a baby dies the soul is not developed what happens to the soul of the baby and example as Sharon Rose died at about 18 months old brother renom saw saw her beyond the curtain of time exactly with a developed uh whatever you know Soul or whatever and she actually knew things and knew where where she was and she knew uh she was mentioned something about Billy Paul waiting on him and all these other things so what transitioned her into that developed State and she died as a baby because she became to the full maturity of what she would have would have been had she come into the world you know and lived uh because you got to admit it that way if she did come to it that way she would have come to it later but God sees that and when he sees that see the baby the soul of that baby is his theophany but then when you change it like that and put it as it goes beyond the curtain of time remember all babies go to heaven it it it's that's what I tried to emphasize this morning in Wednesday night that you know you reach the age of accountability then your soul has to answer see because until that it's not it's under the blood of Jesus Christ so when Sharon Rose left this body she went straight into what she should have been had she come into the natural and been and would never baby be that way now there is some technical question about brother brandom talking when he talks about a baby that's ill legitimate he said I can't see that's a predestinated seed all right I'll go along with him because I believe that that was just an act of life but the baby goes to heaven anyway it don't matter whether it's Mom and Daddy's good or bad or whatever it is the baby goes to heaven automatically all right but see Sharon Rose actually could tell brother brandom what was going to take place so she had entered into a situation of her soul that she connected to the point of being her theop that's what I've tried to explain to you that she then was into the position she should have been but she never attained to that in life you know she didn't live that long all right had you reached the age of accountability then you would have a problem with the soul as the baby going into uh the position of maybe Sharon Rose went I don't put it just because Sharon Rose was his daughter that that would be you're getting a little bit too close to uh trying to make everything work out that way I I'd rather stay with the point that all babies go to heaven and that she was in that form at 18 months old that she knew no sin no situation no regards whatsoever so she would step right into where she should have been to start with because that would be her her doings and that would be her theophany which is her soul she went to the real you her soul and when he saw her she was 18 20 years old you know she wasn't and she never reach that in life so it's not based upon what we reach in life it's What God Says about it all right okay and then U all right one thing I Stumble at is when I hear people say that uh I was born again on a certain day I know you came in the message and studied for two years and then I believe your story is that you and sister Peggy received the baptism Holy Spirit at the same time you fell one way and she fell the other brother Wade I think has a date on the calendar Brother Gary Atkins has a you know a battle of I20 right I don't have any of those red letter dates I've been being born again since uh well basically since I was a child I've been receiving the understanding of the truth and then around the age of accountability was uh convicted and and and got saved as the Baptist call it which was justification and then came into more light much more light in the message and since then I've been continually being born again I've never stopped right but I don't have a red letter date on the calendar I can point to and say it happened on this day does everybody need a date I believe you need the experience but remember the definition of an experience is something you live through it could be over a long period of time see I I admit that I or say that I was I repented I done everything I could do back there in the in the years in the Baptist for that time and then I come into the message but I don't credit it as saying I come into the message meant that I was born again I did go on to a place to have an experience that I can anchor that to and I believe everybody needs something to Anchor it to amen you know I'm not saying for you to to uh deny the Holy Ghost and say you didn't have it I've never taught anybody that way I believe you need to keep confessing it until you will walk into it that's just like me brother randam said if you'll stay under the spout long enough you'll come forth speaking in tongues right but you know I've never spoken AR you going to say that I'm not saved no that wouldn't be the sign of the Wonder the sign of the Wonder is the birth of the word all right now to have the Holy Ghost and have a problem may I quote R random his daughter in law uh receive the Holy Ghost one night right he said it and the next night she was doubting it you see do you remember the man that uh found a little paper you know and what will you do and or whatever it was on the paper and he started searching and going everywhere and and and trying to get people to pray for him to be saved he went to Brother around him and he said you got it when you read that think about that so when you read that said you made a decision right or you thought about it at least you know we'll call it that and see then that way God can can give you the new birth without having some kind of an outward experience or emotions because that's what he said is to receive the Holy Ghost without a sensation now I've always said and believe in it that everybody that's ever born again has an experience and maybe your experience is living through a long period of time but one of these days you'll go back and you'll remember where you got started at maybe and something will trigger from that to be able to tie together but until that time I'm just honest as it can be keep seeking God that's right I don't see where there's any problem with seeking God after you get the new birth I thought that was what it was supposed to be amen don't ever stop praying for God to fill you with his love and understanding to give you a new birth to birth the word that you've heard but remember then the new birth is what a revelation of Jesus Christ and see somewhere you'll tie it to that of saying well there where I got started I got started right there in a Baptist Church at an altar and see I'm just a different type of person see from most everybody most everybody would say well you said you saw the Lord or something when you 12 11 12 years old that's right I did I believe it but when I came on to this message that became alive to me of what I had really seen and all I wanted was to make sure I keep praying every day Lord feel me with your love give me an anchor in my soul I believe that I'm born again but keep on revealing yourself cuz if you do I know I'm born again I'm not going to tell anybody that you're not born again I'm going to just tell you don't stop seeking God all right then if you get upset with me because I'm telling you to don't seek God you know what I'm going to tell you you didn't get born again okay does that offend you I'm going to tell you if you say well i' I'm blessed God I got saved on December the 14th right there and I there and you get mad at me about it because I've stirred you a little bit you didn't get born again that day that's right you're proving it so it's not me telling you you're not born again right it's like I told a brother that left here that time he told everybody said brother Dale said I wasn't saved I wasn't born again I never did I said said I'm telling you your actions the way you're acting is not a Christian right and I don't believe that's a Christian acting like that he went away telling everybody I said I wouldn't he wouldn't I didn't I said you're acting that way that's your choice because the birth to each individual is a birth yes but don't ever stop seeking God if there's anything that ever stuck into my mind is brother random when he would pray he would pray like he was the worst person in the world the worst sinner could ever be thought of and said Lord I Thank you for saving me and Lord just fill me with your love you see you can get to New Birth without really having a great knowledge about it that's my point but somewhere one day you'll connect back to that and you'll and you'll see hey that was where I started at any more yeah um I agree with you on that there was one time in my experience since a Baptist kid that I can think of that I did stop and about that time and that was in the Baptist Church God put in my mind a question about how do I know that I'm right and how do I know that I'm in the right denomination because I prayed one time and said father thank you for letting me be born in the right denomination and I based that simply on the fact that I knew that he knew that I loved him and wanted the truth so I thought he wouldn't be let me wouldn't let me be born in the wrong one because I know we weren't all right all believe in different things but about that time God put the question in my mind how do you know you're right and that's when I was around 15 or 16 years old and then I was 17 when I came to the message so um one other one other question or comment slash question about the soul developing you you preached a while back years ago I guess that Jesus God came down in his son Jesus and in a limited form he was limited to the extent that he couldn't see the sin of those around him or have to kill them right because sin can cannot dwell in the presence of God so then I would say then too that would it be I guess it'd be right to say that Jesus when he was born being that he was our Kinsman he came also with a limited or a underdeveloped I guess you could say spirit and soul and had to develop because he grew in Grace and knowledge I supposed to say he grew in Grace and knowledge and he had to do that to suffer as we suffered and to be tempted in all points as we were tempted I mean that's profound to think that God could limit himself to that extent to where he could be uh limited and so so much to where he had to develop in his spirit and soul so then God I guess you could say you know Elohim LED his son along paths in life through Temptations and everything to develop that soul to what it needed to be right yeah because see if if he grew in Grace and knowledge then there has to be a point that something about him could grow but like you're saying to me that the limit was the fact of him being in human flesh we don't think about us being that that limit that's that limits us as being in human flesh it's pretty easy sometime in that Spirit realm to see things and real good and all but then all at once that human being starts rising up the body and it doesn't work too good you know but that's he grew in Grace and knowledge he was almighty God yeah but remember by being in flesh is what limit him it wasn't spirit and soul limitation it was by being in flesh because it's hard to bring this flesh into being that's right you know you can say all you want to you say well I it's easy no it's not it's hard to bring the flesh into being you can say Well it my spirit that's not into being well just remember your spirit and flesh can't be separated a whole lot you got you got to deal with that anything else that's all okay anybody else any comments up to where we are anybody with any other question I got one more part on here but anybody with any thoughts any questions or thoughts comments Oh Sister Trudy excuse me yeah just today I I got the Revelation to me uh death just helps us step out of this worldly costume it's just like stepping out of a garment and going into another another realm you know it's beautiful that way yeah and there's no fear there that's right got to remember Revelation is always in in the heavenlies right so then Revelation is trying to pull us into another realm right and that's the're doing anything else no not right now anybody else any comments thoughts I have one more here that's kind of a we'll cover it in a rim but uh to the person that asked the question now don't think that I'm correcting your thoughts but I have to correct your thoughts to answer it in the right order okay all right that's a good way of getting by with it I guess but not against anybody It's just sometimes we word something that maybe in your Bible that's laying in front of you it says something but in my Bible it's laying here it's got a different word so then you know I'm I'm saying it that way the best I I can cuz says when we're born again we're sitting with Christ in Heavenly places and I agree that's right Heavenly places now watch not heaven when you're born again you don't go to heaven you're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jes in Christ Jesus you're not going to heaven that's that's still above that's going to take a change a Rapture to take us there and that word comes from Heavenly in that one is 2032 which means like Heavenly Realms I looked this up to me but the person put it this way when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved which was going with Corinthians we have one waiting in the heavenlies right not heaven all right now I agree with the statement okay like we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places we're not in heaven all all right I agree with when the Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting in the heavens it's not in heaven it's right here in us we just step over into heaven when we drop this robe of Flesh we step right into heaven but what I say in that numbers 3272 which means Heaven the one in Corinthians I said I wasn't trying to correct the point I was correcting the word when you you use the word Heaven it says Heavens in Corinthians it doesn't say heavenlies but now maybe your Bible says heavenlies M says Heaven all looks like the same real in both instances I agree when you're born again not your body not your spirit but your soul is brought into eternal life right and that is Heavenly places in Christ Jes Jesus right while I'm living here now I can be so happy I can be to the point of saying wonderful for to be able Lord that you allowed me to see your word I'm in Heavenly places even when he's not revealing it to me I love to read I love to read the word of God even when he's not revealing it now you know what I mean by that how many of you would agree that you read a lot of times and didn't get nothing as we call it you know I mean you read and you read and you read and you say I I just didn't get anything Lord from that and then the next day you pick read the same scripture it's not something different to get but that scripture opens up to you now you're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you a changed the word at all you ain't changed your place that you're in you just just been taken out of this natural carnal mind into a Supernatural part of doings mean because that's the moving of the individual see that's the way I see and believe that your soul is your theophany and the minute you die it's not over there but the second you die you're over there it's right here within you brother said the soul no matter what condition it's in death just takes it to its Destiny we shouldn't even fear death because death is an ability to move from this uh house past house into a wonderful situation but that's all that I've ever tried to preach for all of these years is that Soul because this goes all the way back into the mid 70s at least or in there earlier 1969 in Athens Georgia I was preaching that the Bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man in the last days so you know what I believed it because that was what I was preaching you see death just removes us from this situation to another situation it's not not over the until this one dissolves that's what the scripture said if this Earthly paracle were dissolved it's not over there until this is dissolved who this Mell check we have not the bodies yes all right but we're being built here into the image of that and that's where it was mentioned about that yeah I've always tried to teach you what when how many years ago was that matching pieces probably 1995 okay 1995 I was preaching mashing pieces and my point was the same as of today when Martin Luther there was no way that man could die there was nothing could happen to him because he wouldn't match in what was in heaven but the minute the man reached that message and saw that the just shall live by faith Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in him upon Earth matched him to what was in heaven now he's going you know he had to go from in home but the only difference is somebody's going to get it here because the matching pieces is coming here I want everything brought here you may want to go up that's all right we may be talking about the same thing but that's just me and my carnality all right I don't want to go to heaven heav I want God to come here to take me there then everything will be in great shape and that'll be your matching pieces when it matches here on Earth what you are in heaven that the word says it that's where a lot of people don't get the idea maybe is the thought that I try to make you say well but brother Dale uh I don't find us in the Bible I can find this I can find that I can read this I can see Paul Peter but I don't find us in the Bible the Book of Revelations the book we were told to stay away from that we couldn't understand it the entire Book of Revelations is speaking about somebody and the biggest portion of that is speaking about you and I if you want to read yourself read the book of Revelation cuz I invite you to show me anywhere in the Book of Revelation that Jesus Christ is Ever by come on even after we get out of here he's through the two witnesses show me where he's everbody in the Book of Revelation the book we were told to stay away from is our book to let us know who we are well I just read about a white horse and a red horse and a and a I just read and that's just confusing to me why is it confusing go get the prophet's message and let him explain what that means right and let him it tell about these things like I said here in and we've been reading you know one in the m seven golden candles sck like unto the son of man brother Brandon plainly states bride form he's shown in Bride form why don't we read the book of Revelation then is wonderful book to describe everything to us because it is the book that tells us about heaven it is the book that tells us about the opening of the word it's the book that tells us about the whole Plan of Redemption but we read it still and typ into the symbolics well the prophet told us about the symbolics if you have any trouble with I'll be glad to let you have my Bible on a short term I've done that one time and brother Reed he he finally I sent him one because Jos had one and we we got up and old Bible and let him take it cuz he wanted to get all of the things I wrote on the side you know where the uh you you may not write in your Bible that's that's that's okay I don't I'm not going to condemn you but where brother bandam explain something I like to write it down you know you know and then somebody comes along I said well they used to call my Bible they used to say in the in the Bible study that Jos had to cheat cheat sheet because he had it written down on the side what it was all about and you just turn over and read it where he says in chapter five he said it's not a verse by verse happening he said it's a scene not a verse by verse do it he said it's a scene well see that it hits me I write it down any more questions if anybody got anything sister G I just have a question Genesis 126 and Genesis 27 is it possible that that happened at the same time and if not why would it be that he would create like them a theophany and then flesh later on well it couldn't be at the same time because of the 126 man being the even was created for the foundation of the world you know see we put it there as on the sixth day right but remember like I've stated to you if you're reading the the uh Genesis account you you you got to be real careful how you put that account because the Man was created on the sixth day but yet it's done moved over to where it looks like that he's in the seventh but he's not he's in the sixth day all right so his creation was spiritual man first which would be before the foundation of the world as far as my concerned amen but then the physical man would be chapter 2 see then you put the spiritual man into the physical man so they could be Untold eons of time between the spiritual part in the physical Genesis 2 but it wouldn't make no difference if it was Split Second you know it would still be different it wouldn't be the same point but it would be you know because to me you got to have the you got to get it together where the morning star sang together sons of God shout it for Joy the mind of God and all the things that he saw and then you got to go to uh uh Ezekiel 18:4 All Souls are mine and then go back to the point that brother brandham said All Souls in the mind of God was created for the world you got to go back up into that to be able to come down then to see that the Genesis 2 man was a physical creation that come after the world right see to me Genesis 1 was way before the world yes amen it's just placed over here as to and it's placed really so far over as I said it's hard for you to say this the sixth day you if brother randam didn't say it was a sixth day I could argue with you about it because it sure don't look like it look like the seventh day when man comes into being but he said no that he come to being on the sixth day but his spiritual condition was before the world ever begot to being part of him that's why I believe that your soul is your theophany if you're born again and that's eternal life that all right anything else anybody else we're doing pretty good I got about 7 minutes after 4 so we took a little longer than I thought we would let's go into the communion finish that up get it out of the way and then we will go eat some pizza and they have a good time doing that it's all right if the brothers they got it ready all right so let's stand we'll go into the communion any more questions I don't have the answer to everything I got a lot of questions too that you pray me sister cath going to be getting on anane and they going to be flying out of here and heading up to see Sister Mary all right so let's give them a prayer cloth the piece and let them place it on them we was up to hospital the other day with Anna and we give her the prayer cloth and she taped it under her armband piece brother Danny still got is under his watchband don't worry about wearing him out you ain't going to wear the Holy Ghost off of it so if you say well well I happen to take a bath with that on don't worry about it you ain't going to wash the Holy Ghost off he's the one that's going to take care of you all the way through so let's pray about our brother and sister having a safe trip okay father we ask you to just bless and be with Brother Ray sister Kathy as they're going to see Sister Mary and Lord just take care of them give them a safe journey let everything be safe and sure no problems no trouble with any transportation whatsoever that everything be wonderful and that they may have a good time together as they fellowship and then flying back home Lord take care of everything we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen tell sister Mary we said IO okay we'll go into 1 Corinthians 11 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sub saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup cuz remember if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you're not supposed to take the communion that's that's the point it's it's not supposed to be until you settle that with God for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh them Nation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we're judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat ter one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together un condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come so let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer praying one for another and just keep praying for Brother Gary because you he needs our prayers father we love you and we thank you and we ask you to just bless each one make us worthy to be able to take this communion today because we know that there's nothing in us that is worthy of anything but yet you are the one that's worthy so you just come Lord and you set us all aside that we could have this time of communion together we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we ask you to just bless this bread been made for this purpose this afternoon that we may partake of this and do of what you called to us an ordinance or a thing for the church to do we have this Lord and we believe you and we thank you this is not your body no more than the wine is not your blood but it's in symbolics and we thank you for us us having that understanding of all things being right we love you now we ask you to sanctify this bread and the partakers in Jesus name amen this is not a just a play thing or just a a little ordinance that we take but it is a reality of the word of God because our Lord and Master said for us to do this until he come well there's people in the message that think the Lord has come so much that they don't take communion well I I just don't go along with that I think he's talking more of the physical part of his coming that is not complete yet and in doing that then we just go right on take into communion and don't worry about nobody else but we're not condemning anybody else for their thoughts or ideas we're just being what we are and doing what we believe and letting it be it that way Lord Jesus we thank you for this wine it's went through the process and now gets better with each day because it's a type of your blood Lord that was shed for us and we thank you we ask you to sanctify the wine and the partakers as we together Lord can say thank you for all things and as we eat the natural little piece of bread and drink this little wine tomorrow it will be blood cells in our body cuz there a literal part of it we thank you for all things we love you sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river I'll rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there Glory then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I walk by the River I'll rest need the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me you know to think about the way God does things what about each CH a man that had no physical connection there was no way tide would be in there when he spoke the things to the disciples but he chose the Apostle Paul to write about the communion you know because he could tie it together with the Old Testament and bring it out into being and and let it be into manifestation or maybe the
