Your Grace be there to express yourself unto each one we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now have your way in our hearts and our lives we love you we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord in Jesus name Romans 8 . and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate than he also called in whom he called him he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us he may be seated the Lord had his Blessing if God be for us who can keep this and taking place yeah if God saw a bride that would come to a place in a position to walk off of this Earth then all the gates of hell can't stop her I know that and I realize that the more each day as we go that you know it's all in his hands and everything but we we just appreciate it you know I joined to just make one comment Brother Gary and I was talking a little bit out there a while ago about something you know that I'm always saying and uh I know it's kind of a odd way and maybe a funny way but I'm kind of a funny Feller that seems kind of odd too so it all fits me anyway but we was talking about how that you know I've always said did God before the world see this or are we living exactly what he saw is this it you say well what would that have to do with it well if he saw this it's not something personal to him he could just stay up in heaven and forget it you know but if this is what he saw and he's now seeing it then it's something real and personal you realize that as we go along one of these days and get down to some thoughts about the Rapture you'll see that we've got to realize realization of what's right now me being back before the world there's no faith in me believing that I was before the world you may think well that just makes me feel so great good that's fine but there's no faith back there my faith is anchored right now in what I'm hearing and what I'm able to receive that's building it to the base that my faith is becoming more real you know more real I was thinking while ago thinking well you know a lot of people would be afraid to stand out as I do and just speak hard and straight but yeah I've got two things is to my advantage if I'm right everything's good shape if I'm wrong somebody can help me because at least I'm telling you what I believe if I tell you what I believe then I can have help somewhere down the road all right if I don't you know well I'm kind of maybe maybe that might be right I don't know about no no no it's this one boy ain't gonna do it like that I'm going to tell you what I believe and then we're going to go from dark and I won't have any troubles if you come up and say I don't believe you that's no problem to me you know because I just that's just up to the Lord to reveal not up to me all right now try not to spend too much time on background which I generally do a lot of times but I'm hoping that it's beginning to develop into our thinking as I was saying this morning about the the part of foreknowledge you know meaning that fact are thought of a knowledge before it transpires of what will transpire if if you know they wouldn't have been written about something that would take place in other words if Isaiah was saying a virgin shall conceive if that never had taken place look what it would have been right you wouldn't call it a false prophecy but you would call it a you know it wouldn't be a reality and see the Bible says that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb before the foundation of the world you know slain but now he wasn't physically slain and if that never happened then we're still in our sins but it did happen here on Earth all right so then we try to get everything to line up into that of thinking of foreknowledge because even though we're trying to go back in to the mind of God and think about these things you will see this as quick as we do already have some notes written before we jump right back to where we're at in life because right around and said it was God's plan and purpose to give his eternal life to you and I what about that that was his plan and purpose was to divide himself I remember brother Mo preaching on that years ago you know and you talk about him dividing himself and you think about taking an apple and you cut it up seeing the smallest you could ever cut it up you're giving it away you'd still run out of pieces well the way I look at the way God is and the way he's expanding himself that the more he expands himself the greater he gets instead of running out of pieces you know and and doing it and we're not going to run out of the word don't worry about that no we're going to try to keep right on going with it all right but talking about how does God predestinate he predestinates by his foreknowledge and that would mean that he would be infinite in doing those things and all that's down here in life and everything God knew would take place transpire Among Us and they will be as I said a moment ago a bride because God said it that will walk off the earth in rapture I'm intending to be part of the one that walks off I may not be if I don't worry about whether I'm alive you know that doesn't matter to me if I have to go by the grave that's no disgrace I'll just have to beat you up his sister Cleveland used to say you'd say if I die before before you know you do brother Dale I'll just get to beat you up I said well that's be a good thing she's kind of small she probably whipped me now but because you know but think about it now do you see what I'm trying to drive at I mean whether you believe it or not see there was a time that God dwelt Alone he was self-existing and when he dwelt alone he then he was we can't use the word God because it means an object to worship and we can't use the just the point of Elohim as to be himself existing but to just think about God and how Eternal he is and what he can do that's the whole thing I want you to see if anything else is to look back at God and see his condescending downward to where we can comprehend and if he had not sent us a prophet we would not have it I said this morning maybe that's a hard way of saying it but see we say well well I've got the Holy Ghost God can reveal it to him well why didn't he that's just as plain as it can be man sitting at my house one day and I knew their Doctrine and they said we go beyond brother Branham said you know said he preached us up to here and then we go beyond him I said well according to my understanding brother he preached us all the way to the Future home and I said if you can tell me anything I placed our go ahead you know well he just hushed him called me a smart alec but maybe I was you know but it's true you know because if he could tell me something home Beyond where the Prophet took us going out to eternities and bring down something you know but they didn't have that point in mind you know exactly but now think about it God dwelt Alone but he dwelt alone with his thoughts his attributes now he had attributes in him we went through that this morning you were an attribute in your father but you don't remember being there and there was no part of you there physically in the basis of a of a person the best you could do was maybe a a gene don't even bring it down to a germ because you can't do that when you're coming down from granddaddy you know great granddaddy Etc you only bring it to a germ when you get it to the basis of the connecting to make you so then you would just be in a gene in some connection some way back in your your DNA makeup that they can follow it right but not at something wiggle tails you know you know what I'm getting at the wiggle tails you know the little thing that connects to make the body all right see then you you can't do that it'd have to be wound back past that and and I never could comprehend what was doing it and I knew that but we all did but brother Branham said it one day he said the uh Gene or germ or whatever it would be that would make a a gnat was the same size as a gene or a germ that would make an elephant yeah if you can explain that to me then we'll uh we'll we'll talk a little but now think about it God dwelt Alone with his thoughts all right now then that could not mean that you and I in any form could be back there physically that ought to be enough common sense to think about it you don't need a revelation to realize that you know it's not a supernatural great Revelation boy look at me I was back there you know no what we are had to start somewhere and if it started somewhere it certainly didn't start in eternity I'm talking about me and you now something about us physically cannot be put back into eternity the best we can do is to say in the mind of God all right now but remember that every person that ever be in the world was in the mind of God also at the time he thought of you being here today he thought of the world and how it's going and where the people are at so then we don't lay on well I was in his mind no I want to be apart of God that the only one that's eternal and not to just be something he thought of because that's that's basically our mentality of our thinking is that the best we could do was some word down the line he thought of something well all right he did but just remember the eternal life you have is not a thought of God it's God himself or you've got multiple gods some way you know something figured out so they don't erase a lot of things I've noticed and brother random on a on some quotes looking at he said I'm not doing this to to uh create a doctor and he said I'm doing this to straighten it out you know so that's a good way I'm not trying to show some smart alec Doctrine and thought I'm trying to straighten out our doctrines because God's Doctrine didn't need to be straightened out the Bible said what it meant meant what it said we were the ones that had it confused and so is the prophet's message all right but now to think about it that if God is eternal infinite Etc then he's never had another thought now that that's that's hard for us to even fathom whatsoever that he never had another thought because he thought was perfect eternal all right we'll get to it maybe not today but brother Brown says in a church age book he said the thoughts of God are eternal he said that gives an eternal thought to the elect why because to realize that not that we were what he thought of but to be a part of him I tried to explain right after lights this morning the fact of the thoughts of God and how that our thoughts can be changed or whatever you know added to but his thoughts is a part of him now I believe in this way that God saw that Judas was going to do what he would do you'll go along with it well see then you say well there was no hopes for Judas no he had it offered but God knew he would never accept it he knew he would never accept it well then you're not blaming God are making him a chooser you're making him as to know what will be I believe in Eternal thoughts of God to be a part of that one who was doing the thinking is my desire that way I can rest in knowing that if I have eternal life I don't have to worry about anything he said well if they said to run around and said that would give me a ride to just go out and do anything he said I do what I want to see it's not some loose ended thing that you just sent this way no that's one thing that I'm hoping that about eight sermons on four knowledge or nine I guess it's a 10 or 11 well now that it would finally get down into you as to what I'm trying to drive out this is the most wonderful day that has ever been in the world I had rather be here than to be back there walking on the shores of Galilee with the Lord Jesus Christ you would think oh if I could just be back there see that's you're still trying out here with these old things no I'd rather be here today than any word that I know of In Time or any point because you know what what's going to happen somebody's going to catch it and somebody is going to walk off the earth that's never been done before he said well Enoch done it and Elijah wouldn't know but not this way they went because of God you're speaking it was gone we have something to do with this right we are living our predestination and we're proving what we are and see there's there's no need of worrying that's why I always live an open book my wife says a lot of times that you're just too open no I'm just an open book you know why because I don't want no close pages because if I got closed Pages I'll have to those out to be open one of these days without the answer for see I'd rather just be what I am and I enjoy being a Christian I enjoy thinking about God's word and just meditating on it still in the middle of the night it just something to wake up and to lay there and just think about that God has given you and I all of the word that will ever be given to mankind in this world I'd give my own not me but him you say well the Jews has got theirs but we already know what's going to happen did you listen to why I said it I said he's given unto us all the word that will ever be given on this side of Eternity and we can rejoice in believing it and accepting it in the little simple things that we wondered about you know down through our time in organized religions in time those things are becoming just so simple you remember how you used to think about whether hell was eternal or not and if you went there you might burn eternally because that's what she was taught this little simple thing how many gods are they well we believe it's just one but it's God in three persons Blessed Trinity nobody can understand it we just have to believe and just but to think of the day and the hour that we're living It's the Most Wonderful Time the world has ever seen I told you I love this point so we'll start from that one of the quote we gave this morning from who do you say this is go ahead brother Knight number nine because I love this quote who you say this is 64 12 27 paragraph 67. that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt Alone with his thoughts he'll never do that again he'll never dwell alone with his thoughts why because his thoughts are being made manifest and that's why we are right here right here okay Lula Georgia that's why we're right here this day is God fellowshipping with his thoughts being made manifest see there you are so you by taking thought cannot add one cubit to your stature you can't do no good number two you know but to God to fellowship with his thoughts see his thoughts are being made manifest his attributes are being made manifest and he has the ability to not stay up in heaven but to come down here and fellowship with you and I I thought the prophet said the purpose of God creating man was for Fellowship what part of the fellowship do you think he's going to get the most enjoyment of and don't misunderstand me he enjoys it all he's even not over here pointing to nothing but he's in these churches and they're seeing an endorsement about him and you know he's there because he loves worship no man well look around you might have a problem with a guy sitting next to you a few of you looked around anyway thank you Fellowship brother Bonds were said Two Fellas and one ship that's what I told her brother one time I said I'm tickled to death to ride in your boat anytime you want to ride in it we'll just sit down and talk about what you believe but I said there's only one stipulation I want you to ride in my boat for just a little while I said because I want to talk to you about what I see right all right now let's get on to the thought so we dwelled alone with his attributes that's his thoughts that's his thoughts see we want to put something back younger and put our connections back there and say well if if I could just find out I was back there no as I said I'd rather know him right here because see I know I've experienced salvation so I know I've experienced it I'm not putting it on something somebody might trick my thoughts of a long time ago I am experiencing what I believe and having a good time in doing that all right now here's what we're going to be on this evening so I've had this for us to do on Wednesday but so we're still on the same notes if you got them you can just but I want us to think about back before time or anything back where we was talking about in the mind of God and thinking about God dwelling alone and if there's no part of us humanly speaking could exist in eternity whether Body Spirit our soul see that's why I fight those doctrines you don't realize it see the two Soul people they talked and if you could be saved you had two Souls with the person that couldn't be saved just had one because he got it from the Devil all right but the other one it could be saved he had two Souls Satan give him one the devil give him one well I told him I said I can't go along with that because Satan's not a creator you know so then he can't give your soul he perverts the nature of your soul I talked with a man that started the doctrine I said I can't see it because their point was well all you needed to do was kill that old soul that come from the Devil because that other Soul come from God and always was eternal now check your Doctrine and see if I'm right that was why it was called two Souls one coming from God one coming from the devil kill the one that come from devil when it comes from God didn't need nothing within you don't need Jesus Christ that's what I tried my best to tell some of them I know I'm very good hateful and old goat says things hard but I said I said there's no more than one I told a man it was a Church of Christ one time you know they they believe in water baptism under regeneration I said if that's true now uh the biggest fish place I can find where there's a lot of people is I'll just meet you in Gainesville and we'll go out on Lake Lanier we're the swimming pools the Lakes out you know and I said we'll just walk down the line and we'll just push them in in the name of the Lord Jesus of course he didn't like the Lord Jesus Christ but that's another point but uh you know I said we'll just push them in well that wasn't being sarcastic I was telling the truth and I told a man about the two Soul doctors talking to me I said that be so all you need to do is kill the one that comes from the Devil Boeing he's gone y'all might have to go to heaven right because if you sold the Eternal where's your soul going so you just killed the one they come from the devil do that with a 22 right between the eyes and you got it made you automatically in heaven well you're just too sarcastic did the point get across I don't care about the rest of it did the point get across folks we need a new birth we must have a new birth there's no choice about it because we only have eternal life by receiving it and only by that by him coming to Earth could he share that eternal life with you and I all right what were we back before the foundation world you know back on in God's mind the back part of God's mind back when he was dwelling alone we would have to be a part of that God to be there now will you go along with that we couldn't be there's people in identities because the first thing it was created was angels people didn't come first don't worry about it I got the notes already for the morning Stars saying together the sons of God shouted for Joy they're laying on the desk waiting about three services but think about it to be a part of God not just something he thought of that's not my goal sister Gail to just be something he thought of and the best he could think of me now we will get to it like this you know that foolish virgins are only what he thought of but one day they'll get eternal life but that eternal life they receive will not make them the bride of Christ so they were only a part in the basis of what he thought of we're not just what he thought of we've got to be him made manifest and be careful brother Dale you're going to make us deity how much do you want for the quotes okay did the prophet say it is deity speaking did the prophet call us little Messiahs see I'm talking about being a part of that God that would think of all the other things and at that same time he would think about what I would be if he put me in flesh he knowed that I'd want to be saved not because he would give me eternal life coming upon the Earth with my foreknowledge he would know I'd want to be saved then he could predetermine it but there's no foreknowledge connected to the part of God that I'm speaking of I'm speaking of the one that done the thinking I'm speaking of the god that had the foreknowledge I'm speaking of Sons and Daughters of a living God sons and daughters are God's offspring you follow me not something thinks of but for him why can't we Rejoice about thinking of those things well brother random what were we back there all right let's pick up on number 11. well let me let's get number 10 first brother Joe I don't want to lose this one come back okay who is this Melchizedek recent 65 paragraph 46 47 now in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just got alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect and sat down in his mind and draw out what he thinks it's going to be to build he's going to build create now he cannot create he can take something that's been created make it into something different all right but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires that's the thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then a word a thought when it's expressed as a word a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so if God's attributes excuse me so it's God's attributes then it becomes a thought than a word now in the seal book I'll be glad to find you the pages right around is referring to Moses that said God gave the thought to Moses he said first it's God's thoughts and then it's Moses thought he said it's not a word yet he said then he steps out and speaks and says Let There Be flies he said it become a word so there is a way to come for it to be the word see so that's why he's talking about this it's God's attributes then it becomes a thought then a word notice those who have who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always was not your being here but the shape and form of the infinite God now how much plainer could that be he's covered the thoughts attributes down to thoughts and even down to word and then turns right around and says not your being now you know what he's talking about not our being not us not Body Spirit and soul human beings because that wasn't back there see not your being here he goes on to talking about that God is Not Like the Wind on down below God is a being I love that he's a being he's not like the wind rather random where we what were we before the world were we Spirits now go to number 11. in the first parts of number 11 was on paragraph 165 if we were saved before the fact oh we don't want to stop here if we were saying before the foundation where were we yes yes sir Revelation 13 8 said that we were saved and your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever created then he goes through Ephesians and giving you the scriptures and the things how did he come to Die For Us roll it on up now and we'll go to the the quote that comes after it your name was written in the book for the foundation of the world he goes on to the next paragraph said were we Spirits then no we were not even nothing but in God's mind we were and he spoke it and it materialized so we wasn't spirits we were to have enough one-eyed in high sense he Brother Don rodel used to say a good point anyone one-eyed in high sense knows our bodies went back there and we're named Spirits were in the mind of God in God's thinking then he would speak it it would become material so we're going to be dealing this afternoon with the fact that there's not any part of us physically speaking of any form Body Spirit and soul that would be back there you said well what about your soul not our souls we'll get to that in a minute only the soul that comes from God God's Own God's soul is the only one that has eternal life Even Adam being created come on Blasphemous names God had to breathe into Adam eternal life the rest don't come that way becoming sin right all right let's run on Fires now and pick up what we're doing look at the next one number 12 sirs we would see Jesus 1964. I hate to read all of it but I don't want to lose it either God is life eternal life in the beginning was God it wasn't God at that time because God the English word god means object of worship and there wasn't nothing but him he was eternal just the Eternal one and there was no moon no stars No Angels no nothing but in this being that we call God our Father whose attributes and him was attribute to be father and him was attributed to be God and him was attribute to be son and him was attribute to be Savior and him was attribute to be healer and all these things that we see now is just displaying his attributes yeah now if we if you were in his thinking at the beginning and look at all the IFS if you got eternal life there is only form of eternal life eternal life has no beginning it has no ending so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him your form your shape and what you are now is just a negative okay when you come into the world he explains what you know about 20 God takes a picture life develops it out all right so then what were we not any form of this this is just a negative this this part that we live in is a negative not a positive point okay all right look what he says things that are to be number 13. we've got two of them out here today that they don't have to be back there in the back because whenever doing pretty good so we had these notes along all they got to do is just keep running them now the only way that you can be a son or a daughter of God what because you have to be the have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life that was God there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always well I heard it was in him always now what does he say the gene of your life spiritual life now you be real careful with brother random and watch it and you'll see him so accurate and amazing me of the accuracy the man holds because when he wants to use germ he knows how to say it when he wants to use Gene he knows how to say it you remember what we were saying this morning you and your daddy your granddaddy your great granddaddy he was only in gene when you come to Daddy in connection with Mama you talk about a germ right Gene don't give birth germs look you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and see you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you right to light up this age you're expressing God's life in you because you're our son or a daughter of God therefore you get what I mean they say Amen you are now made you're you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and to this people in this neighborhood where you you associate where you are or God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you you ever if you've got eternal life there's more questions right then it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation World knew that you would be here and when the word or the water the washing and the water of the word fell upon you you it was expressed in a being right now you have fellowship with your father not just as you have with your Earthly father see you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you what about it are we the children of God then we're his offspring and the only way you can be an offspring of God is to be a child of God it says well we must be born again now if not then you're going to have to rewrite the whole Bible the message and everything even two thousand years of church history because every age has had the new birth and believe in God for that age if it's not you're going to have to rewrite and the disciples just come to a knowledge and Jesus just gave them a knowledge and he didn't have to die on Calvary he just gave him a knowledge and went on even in the uh you said well what we need is an opening for understanding even in Jesus after his resurrection he spoke to the disciples and they seen what he was talking about other times they would say now we believe it was just an opening of our understanding that we need or is it in a new birth where the person can come into us why did Jesus have to go to hell if all we need is a knock on the head and kill us to get rid of the Old Devil what does Jesus have to go to hell for I got it laying right here if you want me to read it we'll run around and said his Gene his person his soul his theophany of his being went to hell those disciples laying in the upper room waiting on eternal life had he not come back and given them eternal life where would we all be so it's not just a head knowledge of what we are it's an experience if nothing else this church ought to know brother Dale believes in the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in a definite experience of justification I believe in a definite experience of sanctification I certainly believe in the definite experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in you that's the only way we can have eternal life not killing off some old soul or some thought but an experience that takes place here that's why I'd rather be here than anywhere all right let's go on let's go on down to number 14. um works as Faith expressed Spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things and you do it but that don't mean you're saved see if it's just someone anointing or some Spirit there's some idea that we have or some anointing of a spirit that we shout glory to hallelujah we're saved you know crying for you know whatever that doesn't mean anything read it think of it conference prophesied you just cast out Devils see the spirit anointed him the rain falls under just the unjust the weeds can Rejoice with the wheat but it's what it is at the core okay there's where you can intellectuals can accept and say oh sure that looks good I believe that that still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still It Isn't So come on because that soul hasn't come from God there's only one soul one theophany on Eternal Soul the Bible says All Souls are mine known Ezekiel 18 4. because he created him but there's only one soul in Genesis 1 26 and 27. let us make man in our own image that's the theophany your Prophet said that's why I believe that praise Hebrew 80 of the Hebrew Book your soul is your theophany what a sinner has a theophany a body to go to when he dies I'm quoting brother Branham but a Christian has an upward current Cinder has a downward Christian has an upward and see when you receive eternal life it's not just some baptism of the spirit well I I thought right around talked about it he did because that's what it is but they fail to read these would run around them and it's laying here if you like it lord said God sent back his soul on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost entombment 1953. what is the new birth well it's just a knowledge good Baptist that we believe but it's not some anointing on your spirit what did he say because if that soul hasn't come from God All Souls come from God now what's he just what's he talking about there's only one soul that comes from God eternal that's Jesus Christ every other Soul has to have eternal life Even Adam he breathed into his nostrils and he became a living Soul Blasphemous names the prophet said he breathed eternal life into Adam but see when we're born as babies we don't get eternal life we only get life permitted we're not eternal life or else Jesus Christ would not have it had to come see but if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean that they're saved that's exactly right see the spirit can be there the real genuine Spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you and that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul That Never Dies right it's got eternal life it always was eternal life see it come from God it goes to God it's the soul see why we need to know doctrines and ideas you ask a lot of ministers about the soul and they know nothing about it they've oh yeah the soul towards yeah but I'm not interested in satisfying you to get you to come to church or to be here or whatever to do I'm trying to preach to your soul I'm not trying to preach to your body I'm not trying to preach to your spirit I'm trying to preach to that inward part of you see when God according to souls that are in prison he said if he can get that soul to stand still long enough he said it'll die I think this gets you to listen until it worked and be planted then the Holy Ghost can come on the word why didn't no Holy Ghost come home a whole group of people on the day of Pentecost it came on 120 in the upper room but those were the ones that had heard the word you show me anywhere in the Bible that the holy ghost ever came on anybody that the word wouldn't plant it first that's all I desire show me any Scripture anybody that got the new birth without the word being planted all right well did that make us anything different are we some kind of super duper thing in the end time to see if that Soul hasn't come from God and the only one I'm concerned about being coming from God is his own soul and he sent back that Soul on the day of Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Spirit one because the spirit could anoint the spirit that's why you can have anointed ones and we just read the prophet said you can make it look like it's real now I can't look at you and determine the only thing I can determine is one thing and the only thing you can determine is one thing brother random what is the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word you Shout Scream holler do all you want to still be lost but if you ever receive eternal life you can never be lost if you like 120 it was scared to death right you know one of them remember brother Ryan said one of them said why don't we just take it by faith you know taking it by faith didn't take away fear and if I'd have been there I believe I'd have said to you I'm still scared but when that Holy Ghost came they went right out of that room it wasn't scared of nothing well because they had something not just an anointing not just a fleshly thing they had a person living inside of them Paul said it's not I that liveth the Christ that liveth in me what he says go ahead to the next one 15. this is who is this Melchizedek paragraph 52 53 and we find him at the beginning his attributes and now you were with him then then is when the Book of Life comes into view and he goes through the scriptures you know for the founding think of it before Jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he came on Earth and several thousand years before you come on Earth Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world and the Book of Life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation world that's the Bible true so your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world now you were dire in his attributes I want you you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life that's why you don't remember you're part of his life you're part of God when you become a son and daughter of God right don't remember the point we're trying to get to go on to the next 16. hmm ernan Church AIDS pretty good little bit of reading but bear with me page 149. watch carefully down see this before there was ever respect of Stardust before God was God God is an object of adoration and no one was Dire to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit listen the bride was already in his mind he didn't say on his mind the one I like is I gave you one dish the other week where where brought around and says the bride will never be in his mouth you remember that one a few weeks ago did the bride will never be in his mouth why because he can spew you out right he could feel you out if you're just in his in his mouth because he's going to spew everything else out but when you're in his mind he can't get rid of you he said I mean you're engraved upon the Palms with my hand that scripture Wright was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be in omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts and he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real now they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he's drawn up in which one day will become you remember a while ago we was reading it was like a man with a thought you remember that one remember the quote like a man with his dogs that he could think about what to make now he's saying it God's not that away is he contrary no he's explaining it see God in this point here is not like a man when you come to the Eternal thoughts of God in eternal life he's not like a man that's trying to think out what he's going to do his thoughts are eternal but then when man started to develop or we started he started condescending he started talking about what he would do he's not wrong he's right in both places he just needs a little getting together see here he's talking about it there's no way to change it and you see say that he has chosen Us in him Jesus for the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind launch him and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it he said well then are you trying to say that we are his you know just in his mind no because we were in his mind he couldn't make it wouldn't be Jews I mean he'd be choosing if he picked out a bride are you listening if you were just in his mind just thinking of something he'd be choosing us but if we're a part of his mind if we're a part of his thoughts and that is only the eternal life that you have by the new birth do you understand that get that dwell in you that's what I believe anyway I believe you must receive eternal life if you're born with it then Jesus didn't have to die we'll get to the next message and he's thinking I've got another one but do you see what I'm talking about the bride of Christ it's not just in his mind they're very part of him there is very thoughts listen you know that he could have been God and let me put it let me straighten it out he was God not creating the angels right they made him God they worshiped him you know he could be you're going to frown on me so listen he could be father without a fall the fall bring savior healer two different words he could be a father without a fall that's only talking about the eternal life that's not talking about you and I as people they would have still had to brought us into being some way and he had Adam and Eve in the garden in the correct beautiful position you say how would we come they don't need to talk about it because we didn't but the truth is we could have come had there been no fall but he also had other attributes of Savior and healer so he couldn't have done that so he had to bring it some way that he could not only be God he could not only be father and have offspring but he could be Savior and healer so that would have to develop into the full knowledge and coming forth see but us being a part of God's thoughts not just something he thought of it was just something thought of you're dealing foreknowledge but to go back past four knowledge all the way into the mind to the Eternal God he dwelt alone now this is the way I love it he dwelt alone with his attributes his thoughts he said all right there was a time he was self-existing he dwelt alone with his thoughts his attributes had he not brought us into being as people he would have stayed self-existing if you could bring it into some way without a fall you're leaving him too much back is self-existing you realize Church in the worst shape that you and I could be in he still loves his people he loves his children Prophet said who would God hear quicker an angel or a child of his who would you hear quicker a neighbor or your children come on so the thoughts of God are eternal they are real they're not simply like a man with a blueprint for knowledge a man with a blueprint is for knowledge that's the point we got to this morning with the other quote where brother Brandon said it's just like a man thinking about something he can't create but he can take what's made he said God could create when he moved away now here's the whole point I chose to to start with the quote that he said he would never be self-existing again right I expressed all the thoughts of what we could about Jehovah meaning father with a family see he put us into this world and we could have called him father but that would have never been all he wanted he wanted you and I to love him why does your children love you Terence Lisa has to hide before they could sneak away from baby Ace right now to slip away and hide because we don't he's going to squall his eyeballs out you know why I'm sure I'm just saying it okay playing just talking I'm sure that he loves his up on Nanny on the other side I'm sure of that but what's the difference not it David and him don't have anything to do with him yes they do and play with but not like Terence does a lot of these little kids love Terence because he's always playing with him talking to him he gets them as quick as he can when they're born sits back there and half the time he's got they've got one or two on the line with them half the time holding them why because that child knows they love him because of the way they display it you thank God don't pet and pamper us oh you say I'm so sick I'm feeling so bad my daddy must be mad at me we'll go ask him right ask him if he is is he mad at you would you just think about what he's done for us think about how he saved us he's given us of his own life he's made us what he wants us to be his children and yet every one of us are different right so it's not just one set of line that he wants to to do and have of children he deals with every child in the way of that child and he loves to be worshiped what about the worships one praise a long time one shouts one's emotional another one is just quiet I'm not a prior Warrior never been one never claimed to be one I believe God's answered a few prayers I prayed but I've never been a prior Warrior there are prior Warriors that people just pray and pray and I thank God for that because who was it one of the Great Men down through time when he would go in to have a Revival he would get people and just put them under the bridges prayer warriors he put them under the bridges for the people to cross over to come into the city and revivals swept forth that's their ways but some are like me just you don't have to pet and pamper me I love it I'm a human being but you know how to do that I love you whether you love me or not whether you'll ever love me or not I love you and I don't love my kids just because they're my offspring I have a personal relationship with each one of them in a personal way the grandkids the great grandkids I have a relationship with each one of them they know they can come to Papa anytime and probably help them well because I want to be that to them if we could be that to one another how about God who loves us he gave sister Gail you the new birth for some reason he said well no I was just so good foreign he gave it for some reason he made you his child for some reason what is that reason or what is that thought that we need to bring I believe that the children of God who have eternal life that eternal life is a part of God put into you and I makes us his offspring so no matter what you think there was something about you that God did like but yet he offers it to everybody to where he's not a respecter person but he knows who will receive it and who won't do you say but I've got all these quotes brother they were the prophet said you always was eternal keep on reading as you're reading that and notice what he says if you have eternal life you always was eternal if you have eternal life that eternal life was eternal not the form of our being here not any of this Mom and Daddy had a way of bringing those things but yet before the world ever begun God's plan and purpose was not to have a Judas that would be lost remember he cannot cannot lose you and then try to save you just for some purpose like that he can't make you lost just to get to save you so he put us on three more agencies where we could choose though he placed Adam and Eve in the garden but yet knowing what they would do and when he did they turned him down but you know what Adam had eternal life and I believe Eve had eternal life in her soul why because brother Ryan said they had the same theophany that's what he says and they don't argue with me about it go to uh Janice question answer on Genesis they had eternal life given unto them imparted but yet the Bride of Jesus Christ has eternal life by choosing they never chose to have it but we chose to have eternal life we accept him as our savior you know what then he accepts us but see the way people preach it they preach it with the same old calvinistics ideas and talks and it comes back to that one old thing that I talked about this morning that old ego that old ego when salvation has nothing to do with the Flesh of mankind they will be a day this flesh will be made Eternal why because we're going to where our father's at don't ever get in your mind that we were some kind of a little something running around up in heaven just get in your mind one thing brother Dale please there is only one God and that God is eternal and that God had to come down and some way and I can't explain it I don't know how he could come into you and I and give us eternal life can you explain what would cause that to happen without running into some form of a choosing I've done the best I could do 10 sermons to get you away from those things to think about something we could be the only thing we are is we accepted him that's what brother Dale I got word of prop amen I've been through that he said it's not whether you choose him or not that's whether he chose you and we were chosen remember in him so we remember the message it's not whether or not brother Mark that I'm chosen is whether or not he was chosen because if I'm in him and he chose him I've got it made are you listening God chose Jesus Christ to die for our sins you know the whole story he didn't choose another person a second person or a son he came himself that's why I don't believe in many gods if you believe that you are a son of Jesus which were the son of God you're a grandchild is that simple but now if you believe that Jesus was God the Eternal God dwelling in flesh and that old Calvary he could rip that life out the prophet says it because he was body of creation Hebrews 11 5 the body that has made me the Run said the father made it for him you explain it but inside of him was a very Spirit of almighty God in the very soul of almighty God and when he died on Calvary he released that Spirit it went back to God he could come back and anoint people to be anointed yes with the very Soul was the one that went to pay my price in hell the scroll the spirit the person the prophet said of his being the theophany and see then when that person that you and I when we die to ourselves through justification sanctification the cleansing of the vessel getting the soul cleaned enough the word God could come in and bring his own life the prophet said it's you and God and I are together as persons you can't explain that because he's not talking about two people it's not you and God and there's two different persons it's God who has given eternal life to your soul and that's a child of God that's a offspring of God you see why we need a new birth more than anything yes but brother Dale I believe the message I shouted what we just read as your Prophet said you can do every bit of that and still be lost you tell me the devil don't believe this message until you need to wake up he knows more about it you and I do but he's also smart enough until I watch very carefully what I read maybe I shouldn't say this I'm too blunt I guess I find too many mistakes in a lot of the books I read I'll be glad someday to go through them with you now I'm not throwing off on them people because heaven helped the people that was translating them and bringing it out they've done the best they could do but if you punctuate this thing wrong you're changing the very thought but thank God for what we've got come on Church but even a tape I can't do it now with these mp3s and things now Richard can because he's got the ability but in them old type days I could cut and splice a tape so perfect until you'd never know that I'd cut that tape and took part of it out because we couldn't afford to send back after new tapes every time one got broke we had to cut them and put them back together right brother Ray so we know we were losing maybe a word or something but you can make bread around say anything you want to but there's one thing about it if I have the spirit of almighty God Living In My Soul by the new birth I'm not worried about who's trying to misinterpret or mistranslate I'm depending on him to bring a message what do you think about it God will never again dwell alone and once he started condescending this way he started bringing himself into being and he brings Jehovah into being and he says I'll be like a father with a family eternal life what does it mean to you well I always was eternal I got all these quotes I always was eternal I don't have to be saved brother Dale I've had people to say that I've heard a lot of preachers say that that you've listened to that's why I said finds you had to listen very carefully to brother Dale and anybody else yeah but brother Dale you're too sweet of a guy you know better than that I don't have to explain that part you know this ain't no sweet old guy this guy's fighting for his life and emotional fighting for yours I'm trying to get you to at least have an ability to be able to receive the message correctly then what you do with it after then I can't my kids are not saved because they're my kids but God did say you will be there with your Offspring so if I can believe it then I'll accept it what do we think about it God to never dwell alone that he could save Jacob but he'd know what Esau would do so we could go ahead and write it down see then we're proving our predestination come on brothers we're proving what we are I don't have to prove a thing brother Dale if you don't live a Christian Life you sure ain't an example it's got to be in him isn't it what are we going to sing boys I am blessed okay I know I am you know okay let's say you guys Stand Together okay boys go ahead yeah I'm glad I am blessed every day that I live if I am blessed right when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head not till I left because you cut your day short I am blessed thinking unto him I am I am I am blessed every day that I live I am I'm blessed when I wake up in the morning when I lay my head to that I am blessed but I am blessed I am but eternal life what does it mean to you means a difference of whether or not that I'm saved run around and got in the field one got over the seventh seal and what'd he say the one with the same simple message is it called if you don't you work yourself away from it what is the same simple message and on that future home come at a place we go to right right in the middle of it he said if you don't get nothing else he said you get this Plan of Salvation most marvelous message you know about page 15 16 and read what he says about the new birth how you're Justified how you're Sanctified the unclean Spirit goes out and how that Holy Spirit comes and lives in you they folks be talking about a world for us to go to you realize that we're not if we don't become any children here we won't become his children die I hope you understand that form even though that those who get eternal life into white Throne will not be the Sons and Daughters of the Living God they will be impartation imparted unto him because you came fall is not too bad if we get on the right Channel think about Redemption remember redeemed means to go back where you come from right if you only go back to his full knowledge you're not redeemed I'd put that in my account and think about it if you want to go back to foreknowledge you're not fully redeemed redeem means to go back where you come from if you wasn't there you never will be there that's why the prophet will say if you have eternal life the eternal life you have never had a beginning and never had an ending not to do it let's sing ain't God good okay nobody okay yeah love and praising a little more today you believe it I ain't gone through it he blessed things undisturbing that's what we are we ought to thank you love and praise him a little more today what happened to us I'm a brand new man all things are passed away I've been born again that's what I am you dismissed just sing after one another as you're leaving pray one for another foreign all right foreign
