[0:54] of Jesus Christ
[0:56] amen amen so this morning I the
[1:00] blessings of a
[1:01] mother and uh Proverbs 1 got two
[1:05] scripture readings here Proverbs 1 7-9
[1:09] says the fear of the Lord is the
[1:11] beginning of knowledge but fools despise
[1:14] wisdom and instruction my
[1:17] son hear the instruction of thy father
[1:20] and forsake not the law of thy
[1:22] mother for they shall be an ornament of
[1:25] Grace upon thy head and chains about thy
[1:28] neck
[1:30] and Proverbs 6:20
[1:32] says my son keep thy father's
[1:35] commandment and forsake not the law of
[1:37] thy mother bind them continually upon
[1:40] thine heart and tie them about thine
[1:43] neck when thou goest it shall lead thee
[1:45] when thou sleepest it shall keep thee
[1:48] when thou awest it shall talk with thee
[1:50] for the Commandment is a lamp and the
[1:53] light and the law is light and reproofs
[1:55] of instructions are the way of life
[2:01] um so
[2:05] um I've been uh doing a little studying
[2:08] on on this and looking at some different
[2:11] things
[2:12] and there was a Sunday uh a teacher she
[2:17] had a group of uh second graders and she
[2:21] was teaching on on magnets and what they
[2:24] what they're used for and U sometime
[2:28] after that she had a she had they had
[2:30] the class had a test and she included
[2:33] one of the a question on the test and it
[2:37] said my full name has six letters the
[2:40] first one is m i pick up things what am
[2:46] I they said when she when the children
[2:49] turned in the tests and she checked
[2:51] almost half of them had answered
[2:54] mother and so I thought that was really
[2:57] good that you know because Mom's do so
[3:00] much for us and you know they help us
[3:02] out so much and um I was wanting to you
[3:06] know I was looking in the scripture I
[3:08] was trying to find something that you
[3:10] know to from the scripture and I I've
[3:12] been reading different ones and I've
[3:14] been uh just in my personal reading I've
[3:17] been reading in the Book of Proverbs
[3:18] quite a bit and uh I just i' had come
[3:21] across these
[3:23] and you know it says the the fear of the
[3:26] Lord is the beginning of of knowledge
[3:30] and you know God told us to honor our
[3:32] fathers and our mothers you know he said
[3:35] he said hear the instructions and
[3:36] forsake not the law of thy
[3:38] mother and it says and it shall be an
[3:41] ornament of Grace upon thy head and
[3:43] chains about thy neck and in Proverbs it
[3:46] tells us it said tie those about thy
[3:49] neck and I was looking at that and you
[3:52] know it talks about the uh ornament of
[3:55] Grace upon your
[3:57] head and see those are things that not
[4:01] just as in Proverbs where it talks about
[4:04] uh bind them continually upon your heart
[4:07] not just on the N word but when it talks
[4:09] about it being an ornament of Grace upon
[4:11] your head or chains about thy neck or
[4:12] binding them about your neck I was uh
[4:15] doing a little reading and you know it's
[4:17] those things are not just things that we
[4:20] take inwardly but it's things that are
[4:22] expressed outwardly and those things so
[4:26] it's not just things that um we we hold
[4:29] in our heart but it's things that we've
[4:30] learned and things that we've been
[4:32] instructed in that we ought to express
[4:35] and we should show those things and you
[4:37] know um I always tell everybody that you
[4:41] know I I look so much like my my dad and
[4:44] so many things um I I can see my dad but
[4:48] then you know uh people will tell me how
[4:51] much I'm like my mom I guess I have a a
[4:54] sense of humor and and different things
[4:55] and certain expressions and things that
[4:58] come from my mom and uh and somebody
[5:02] said that I have a uh the ability or the
[5:06] uh uh the uh I do it very often uh I
[5:11] always always make list out for
[5:13] everything you know I like to write
[5:14] everything down and my mom's got lists
[5:16] for lists because you know of of things
[5:18] that she writes down because she keeps
[5:20] up with everything but you know it's one
[5:22] of the things like you can't argue with
[5:23] her about uh points because you know
[5:27] she's got a list of everything that's
[5:28] been wrote down so uh she can she's got
[5:31] she's got evidence because she's got it
[5:33] in in black and white so um but you know
[5:36] that's way sometimes it it keeps it's a
[5:38] way of keeping up with things of knowing
[5:40] what's what needs to be done and what
[5:42] you you know keeping up with dates and
[5:44] different things like that because
[5:46] people well I'll just remember that well
[5:48] you won't and sometimes you you don't
[5:51] you don't remember those things and and
[5:53] uh I think it was Einstein that said
[5:56] pale linkk was better than good memory
[5:59] and so you know those things we we get
[6:01] from our our uh from our parents but you
[6:04] know that's one thing I always remember
[6:05] about mom she always had she had always
[6:06] had a list for everything and so th
[6:08] those things that that you've been
[6:10] taught you know write those things down
[6:13] but it's like um here where he was
[6:15] talking about forsake not the law of thy
[6:16] mother the things that you've learned
[6:18] from your parents and you know the one
[6:21] thing that I I think about my
[6:27] mom I never
[6:31] you know people always talk about
[6:33] ministers being Papa called Mama
[6:36] sent you know I can say I wasn't like
[6:40] that and so many times in my life when
[6:43] when I want to do something I always
[6:45] told everybody that my mom should have
[6:47] been a
[6:49] lawyer because I mean she always come up
[6:52] with all kinds of uh Arguments for or
[6:57] against something and it was always you
[6:59] know why or why not well my mom she she
[7:03] could build a
[7:04] case on why it should be or what because
[7:06] whatever she believed in she believed in
[7:09] and she build a case for
[7:11] her and you know and so there's a you
[7:14] know instead of
[7:17] um having somebody just try to push you
[7:19] into
[7:21] something I appreciate that she stood
[7:24] there and she was like you got to make
[7:27] this decision for yourself
[7:30] are you sure are you
[7:32] sure and sometimes I think that's really
[7:35] helped me be the person that I am today
[7:38] because I don't mind standing on my on
[7:40] two
[7:42] feet because it's not just having
[7:45] somebody hand you everything
[7:48] right because you know you start out
[7:51] with a
[7:52] mom and you
[7:54] know they feed you and they clothe you
[7:58] but you know there's there's
[8:00] uh milestones in your life there's
[8:03] certain levels that you've got to reach
[8:05] in life and you know one of the first
[8:07] things they try to do is teach you how
[8:08] to
[8:10] walk well you know you can't carry a
[8:12] child forever you've got to get to the
[8:15] point where they've got to put their
[8:16] feet on the
[8:17] ground and you know you got to let them
[8:20] and it's like all you can do is protect
[8:21] them and watch over them but you the
[8:23] rest of the time they got to do it on
[8:25] their own they got to learn how to pull
[8:27] up on their own you can't do do that for
[8:29] them they've got to learn how to balance
[8:32] on their own now you can hold their hand
[8:35] but they got to put their feet on the
[8:36] floor and they got to be able to walk on
[8:38] their
[8:39] own and there's some there's a time when
[8:41] you you go through that you know you got
[8:43] to turn them
[8:44] loose because they got to learn how to
[8:46] walk on their
[8:47] own and you just stand there and you're
[8:50] close by and you're just watching them
[8:53] just trying but they've got but they've
[8:55] got to turn loose and go on their own
[8:58] and all through all through life it it's
[9:00] the same it's the same thing we got to
[9:02] come to the place as they as they grow
[9:05] up you they've got to experience things
[9:07] on their own I mean and it's the same
[9:10] thing it's a turning loose and you just
[9:12] got to set up parameters for them to be
[9:14] in but they've got to be able to walk
[9:16] and all the other things you know you
[9:20] try to teach them right from wrong and
[9:23] even even just common courtesy and
[9:25] manners everything that's taught you you
[9:27] know you have to reinforce those things
[9:28] and just show them
[9:32] and I was I
[9:34] was when the boys were little you know
[9:38] you go back to things that happen in in
[9:39] your life experiences that you've had
[9:41] and you know it's just like you get to a
[9:43] certain age and and and Adam he's got
[9:46] really always had real bad allergies and
[9:49] you know it was all the time blowing his
[9:50] nose and everything like that it's like
[9:52] well listen you know you get to a point
[9:53] where somebody don't have to tell you go
[9:55] blow your nose you know because you know
[9:57] it's like well Mama blows your nose all
[9:59] the time cuz you know you're running
[10:01] around and she's trying to catch you
[10:03] come here so I blow your nose but then
[10:05] there's a time you know it's like
[10:06] somebody shouldn't have to tell you to
[10:08] do that you should be able to do that on
[10:10] your own Hey listen you know and then
[10:14] you know uh you know some children
[10:17] levite um they uh they you don't realize
[10:21] it but but they think they wear their
[10:25] cleanex and it's
[10:27] like it's like no no listen we we have
[10:31] handkerchiefs we have tissues we have
[10:33] things that you don't have to do that
[10:34] you know but I mean it goes there's a
[10:37] whole process of things that you have to
[10:39] learn but you know Mom pushes you in
[10:43] that way and you know and so you know
[10:46] you think about all the things that you
[10:48] you go through in life and and you know
[10:52] it's not just not
[10:55] just I know this morning we we talk
[10:57] about just our our moms as the ones that
[11:01] birthed us and raised us but you know
[11:03] there's a lot of
[11:05] women that you know I I I sometimes they
[11:09] don't think they get the recognition
[11:10] they ought to
[11:12] right just just because you don't birth
[11:14] the
[11:15] child that doesn't mean that this day is
[11:18] not
[11:19] yours and you know one of the things is
[11:23] uh when when you look at not not just
[11:25] the because in and just even in the um
[11:29] definition of the word it doesn't just
[11:31] necessarily mean women that birth
[11:34] children but it's a female parent
[11:36] somebody that fits into that category
[11:38] there's a lot of grandmothers that fit
[11:40] in that category there's a lot of aunts
[11:42] that fit in that category because you
[11:44] know that's that's the one female
[11:48] per uh lady there's a woman in your life
[11:53] that really had an impact on you growing
[11:56] up and you know some people you know
[11:58] they they lose their they lose their
[12:00] their biological mothers at an early age
[12:02] but there's somebody that's always been
[12:04] there to help raise you to help support
[12:09] you and you know even even as the as the
[12:14] Apostle Paul tells us in the scripture
[12:16] you know we should honor the older women
[12:20] as mothers and the younger women as
[12:23] sisters and you know I've always and
[12:24] I've always said and I always say this a
[12:27] lotone when I always talk about our
[12:29] church I tell them I've got a lot I've
[12:31] got a lot of moms
[12:32] here I feel I feel like I've got a lot
[12:35] of moms here and you know because over
[12:38] the over the 20s something years I've
[12:39] been here I feel like I've had a lot of
[12:41] moms that have really um tried to be
[12:44] very supportive of me and uh maybe give
[12:48] instruction
[12:50] too but you know it's it's a blessing
[12:52] that that you know so not only it just
[12:54] just a a female parent or somebody in
[12:56] that parenting role but somebody that
[12:58] had that was older had a or someone that
[13:02] was in
[13:03] Authority School teachers Sunday school
[13:05] teachers there's different ones that fit
[13:07] in that category that have that same
[13:09] motherly
[13:10] role and and and so this morning I I
[13:13] want to thank all the
[13:15] sisters and don't discount what you've
[13:17] done what God's called you to
[13:20] do because you know there's there's no
[13:23] there's no big eyes or little 's and um
[13:27] I want to I want to get to a few things
[13:28] that this morning if I if time holds but
[13:32] uh time's Moving on but uh you know I
[13:34] think about
[13:35] uh the uh the old the elderly uh
[13:41] sisters or somebody somebody that uh
[13:44] even the word mother talks about even
[13:46] the origin or the source of something
[13:49] somebody that's come and really helped
[13:51] you start out in a certain way or do the
[13:53] different things and it's not just but
[13:56] any kind of uh lady that's really helped
[14:00] you in your life your Sunday school
[14:01] teachers I know people that have talked
[14:03] about even even people that are uh piano
[14:06] teachers and different things like that
[14:08] have really had an impact in their life
[14:09] that uh you sew seeds into that into
[14:12] that person's life and many years later
[14:14] they still remember what that person's
[14:16] done for you and and not so I I think
[14:19] about all of those things and the the
[14:23] affection and and things that have been
[14:25] from different different sisters
[14:28] different women in your life that have
[14:29] really been a a blessing to you and you
[14:32] know I think today is a day not just
[14:34] think our biological moms but for all of
[14:37] those those ladies those sisters that
[14:40] have that have labored in whatever kind
[14:42] of way to be a blessing to you I I think
[14:45] we honor them today
[14:49] also and uh I was I was doing a little
[14:52] research and on this topic and uh just
[14:55] want to share a few things with you that
[14:58] uh I thought was uh really
[15:00] interesting
[15:02] U of all if you take all languages in
[15:05] all the all the world if you take every
[15:08] language and the first 23 words that are
[15:12] written in any
[15:14] language of any any so as far back as
[15:19] scientist and archaeologists or whoever
[15:21] linguist have studied all throughout the
[15:23] world one of the first 23 words that are
[15:26] written anywhere that we know of any
[15:29] known language one of those words is
[15:32] mother and I thought that was pretty
[15:34] amazing that and even when you go back
[15:36] and you start looking at the U atmology
[15:40] of words and you start tracing back how
[15:42] all these words uh fit together in the
[15:44] beginning and the root words and and you
[15:47] know even uh you go back and start
[15:49] looking at you go back to the Greek and
[15:51] the Hebrew and and Latin and and all
[15:54] these different ones and even you know
[15:56] uh just like Spanish you know being uh
[16:00] MRE being mother and mother and you know
[16:03] a lot of different uh languages mom is
[16:06] pretty close to being together because
[16:08] if you look how it goes back but uh I
[16:10] was reading and and this man was talking
[16:13] about the
[16:15] uh atmology of words when you start
[16:17] tracing it back to seeing how all this
[16:20] ties together and he said when you go
[16:24] and you start looking at the structure
[16:25] of words and he talks about mothers and
[16:29] the impact that they have in our lives
[16:31] and build and he's like if you follow
[16:33] this back far enough you'll find that we
[16:35] have two words that I thought was really
[16:38] interesting the first one is the word
[16:40] matter when you go back to because in
[16:44] science you know matter is what
[16:46] everything consists of so when you go
[16:49] back look at atams and all this it's
[16:52] matter and and so the root when you when
[16:55] you trace it back the root for the word
[16:57] matter goes back is tied to the same
[17:00] root that mother comes
[17:02] from because it all ties together
[17:05] because everything that we have comes
[17:07] from our mom she brings us she's our
[17:10] origin she's what brings us in and it
[17:12] all ties back together so the word
[17:14] matter as far as science the building
[17:16] blocks of all things are tied back to
[17:19] that same word but also the word
[17:21] material the material also goes back to
[17:24] that same route and I thought that was
[17:26] really interesting how all of that ties
[17:28] together because you know what what
[17:30] matters is what our moms teach us but
[17:33] and the and the M material so everything
[17:36] that we have are the building blocks of
[17:38] Our Lives come from our mom and it also
[17:42] when you look at the root word of that
[17:43] it all comes from the same
[17:45] word and even even when you go back even
[17:48] further into some of the other ones uh
[17:51] even the root word from the word Sans
[17:53] from the Sanskrit
[17:56] language um which is ma it me means to
[18:00] make and I thought that was really
[18:02] interesting because you know what that's
[18:04] where our moms are the ones that bring
[18:06] us into this and they're the ones that
[18:08] bring us life and they're the ones that
[18:09] show us what matters and they're the
[18:11] ones that give us the building block
[18:13] they give us the things that we need to
[18:15] be successful in life what matters is
[18:19] our moms and what matters in our lives
[18:22] are the things that our moms teach
[18:24] us and I thank God for mine that you
[18:27] know all of those things is
[18:30] brother
[18:33] uh brother
[18:35] Ryan my mind went blank but I was
[18:38] thinking about brother Brian talking
[18:39] about the Fifth Gospel you know we have
[18:42] we have the Bible but the first preacher
[18:45] that you have the first one that's going
[18:46] to teach you about God is your mother
[18:48] and here she is to teach you these
[18:50] things to bring you up in and admonition
[18:53] of God and to bring you to the place
[18:56] that you ought to come to not just in
[18:59] the in the natural and and showing you
[19:01] the things that you need naturally but
[19:03] the things that you need spiritually to
[19:05] bring you to the place that you need to
[19:07] be equipped because you know as as
[19:11] someone says if you if you uh if you get
[19:16] your child into
[19:18] Harvard but they don't make it to Heaven
[19:21] you
[19:24] failed because you know if we could if
[19:26] we just equip them just just for the
[19:28] natural world just to be successful here
[19:31] but if they're not successful if they
[19:33] don't get to the place spiritually that
[19:36] they need to be if that then you know
[19:38] what we we
[19:40] failed because I would much I would much
[19:42] rather my children know Jesus Christ in
[19:45] the power of his
[19:46] resurrection than to have all the money
[19:49] in the world that's right because you
[19:51] know what H what profit is a man if he
[19:54] gains the whole world and loses his own
[19:56] soul that's right and what will a man
[19:58] give in exchange for It
[20:00] soul and so it's really important to see
[20:03] those things what we need in this
[20:08] world
[20:10] and we see here in
[20:13] in Proverbs
[20:16] 31 you know it talks about the virtuous
[20:19] woman and her
[20:21] price it says her price is far above
[20:25] rubies and I'm not going I'm not going
[20:27] to get into that this morning but you
[20:29] know you you think about all the things
[20:31] that she done all the work that she put
[20:34] in and in the Scripture it says that her
[20:38] children rise up and call her blessed
[20:41] her husband also and he praiseth her all
[20:44] the things that she all the labor that
[20:46] she puts in and all the things that she
[20:49] done and the example and all of the
[20:52] service all the things that talks about
[20:54] there in Proverbs that that a woman does
[20:57] that a mom puts in all the work that she
[20:59] puts in and God calls her blessed and
[21:02] you know I can say that I am blessed
[21:05] this morning I've been really blessed
[21:08] and I before before I finish this
[21:10] morning you know you you look and
[21:13] brother randam says here in the message
[21:16] letting off the
[21:19] pressure he said we serve God in the
[21:21] category that we're put in and it comes
[21:23] back just the
[21:25] same and you know God brother br here
[21:29] and he's speaking of um there's a couple
[21:32] of people I want to look at but this
[21:33] morning you know when I was reading and
[21:35] and thinking about I always think about
[21:37] sister Ford I don't know if y'all
[21:39] remember Lloyd Ford was a was a friend
[21:41] of brother Brams and his his mom uh was
[21:45] Sister Ford and he called her mother
[21:47] Ford and you know he says you know he he
[21:50] said um when she passed away you know
[21:53] Lloyd come to brother randam and wanted
[21:54] her wanted him to do her funeral and and
[21:57] he says you know here is little mother
[21:58] forward as we know her and he said she
[22:01] washed my little dirty face when I was a
[22:03] little kid many times said they was as
[22:06] poor as as poor could be and he she was
[22:10] born a female a lovely girl but you know
[22:14] and all the things you know said talking
[22:16] about helping the neighbors and all kind
[22:18] of stuff the the testimony that she
[22:22] had but he said above all that he said I
[22:25] had the privilege one time of seeing
[22:26] that seed German gerz by by the Holy
[22:29] Spirit she was bornn again of the spirit
[22:31] of God he said now we're going to plant
[22:33] her in a little bit in the ground and it
[22:36] was talking about he said how can we
[22:38] intelligent say that she will not rise
[22:41] again and I always I always think about
[22:43] every time I hear that you know of of
[22:45] the testimony what kind of testimony we
[22:48] could
[22:48] live and always think about her and her
[22:52] testimony you know just just a poor lady
[22:55] there in the church and everything but
[22:56] you know she had a real impact on
[22:58] brother
[22:58] random and the other lady I always think
[23:01] of when when I think about Mother's Day
[23:03] and there's a lot of moms but you know I
[23:06] the one person that always stands out to
[23:08] me is uh Abraham Lincoln's stepmom her
[23:12] name was Sarah Bush Lincoln and we'll
[23:14] have the musicians come y'all y'all can
[23:16] come on but uh I always think about her
[23:18] you know he lost his he lost his birth
[23:20] mom when he was 9 years
[23:22] old and his stepmom she she she came
[23:27] into his life when he 10 years old but
[23:30] she was a very spiritual
[23:32] lady and she's the one that really saw
[23:35] that God had his had his hand upon
[23:37] Abraham Lincoln God had a calling in his
[23:40] life to do something great you know she
[23:43] would really encouraged him to study
[23:45] even though his dad just wanted him to
[23:46] be a
[23:48] worker like you know he worked on the
[23:50] farm and he worked on other Farms
[23:51] because he made money but there was a
[23:53] thing that she really instilled in him
[23:55] was the uh the Bible
[23:59] and Pilgrim's
[24:00] Progress you know she really had and she
[24:03] really encouraged him to study and and
[24:07] seek God because God had had a calling
[24:09] in his life and you know it's I always
[24:13] think about her because sometimes we
[24:14] think you know we we don't realize what
[24:17] the power impact that we have in
[24:19] people's lives and just because you're a
[24:21] stepmom or whatever doesn't mean that
[24:23] you are not meaningful you won't have an
[24:27] impact on people
[24:29] brother BR
[24:30] says he says he said your mother he said
[24:35] if you want to do anything for her he
[24:37] said do it
[24:38] 365 days a year he said go to her house
[24:42] and offer prayer and live for God that's
[24:45] the thing to do and bring up your
[24:47] children and when your children come up
[24:50] they'll call you blessed after you've
[24:53] passed on Beyond the Veil that's the
[24:54] real Spirit of motherhood and the real
[24:57] Spirit of Mother's Day Mother's Day is
[25:00] 365 days a
[25:02] year and so I I thank the Lord for all
[25:05] the all the blessings that I've I've
[25:09] received and not just from my mom but
[25:13] all the other sisters that have been a
[25:14] blessing to me and that's what I want to
[25:17] be I want you know because I want to I
[25:20] want to be an
[25:22] example that their their labor their
[25:25] hard work everything
[25:28] then we can show them what the example
[25:31] that they've taught
[25:33] us and
[25:36] so I want to thank each one of you this
[25:38] morning all the sisters it's been a it's
[25:41] been a a wonderful thing and we may not
