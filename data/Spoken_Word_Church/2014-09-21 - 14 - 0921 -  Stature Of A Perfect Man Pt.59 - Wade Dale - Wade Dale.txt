TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that so he had to come to bring all this up and us last people to the complete work he didn't he didn't come to just scruple around he'd come for a reason right and that was the reason the restorative complete well see 40 1947 he preached the word first serve when he preached was what 1947 first recorded sermon was so he started right here and from 47 to 1963 he preached it here in tight okay and type he preached to hear he thought he was finished remember spoken words original C 1962 he said the true word struck the Earth or Robert Plant the scene Billy Billy Graham plant seed and I plan to see but remember the holy spirit said pick up your pen and run he said as of yet yeah Malachi 4 has not been made known now it was not the first part of Malachi 4. remember the prophet Malachi 4 has to do two things number one go to Malachi four go to Revelation 10 7. that's why my brother Brown had to put them two together Revelation 10 7 was this coming down so that we have the ability to receive this so he had to put 10 7 Revelation 10 7 with Malachi 4 because Malachi 4 does say restore the hearts of the children right to the fathers this was to follow children to the fathers okay because remember it was the fathers to the children's what John took the Old Testament fathers and brought them to newborn baby brought them you know in dispensation coming across then you come back around where the fourth Spirit of Elijah had to bring this restore back to here 47 to 63 but you can't throw away 47 to 63. you have no Foundation you just have this and you can't understand this without this this for well that's not really working in your life there's no way you can understand this we got to go sorry Fred well just hold it for next week that's why these are we have to do these people it's a recorder we're gonna read some things today what we're going to do is we're going to try it we I think we're okay and through with brotherly kindness that's going to be a hard one for everybody to grab a hold of but it is this the thing that this whole pyramid hinges on is if we don't come to brotherly kindness we can't come to the rest of it so as we come up and we see these virtues working in our life let's start this and we see them working in our life we got to come to brotherly kindness and I want to mention something to you today for you to think about all right in every age okay in every age everybody got me every age Paul we know for sure do we say well the first church age are they even actually the first three Church ages had the faith of the fathers which is right here got it everybody got that everybody understand that this is the faith of the fathers James says contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints Peter said Silver and Gold Have unknown Paul casting out Devils we see those and I like what that brother said Wednesday night I really enjoyed it that was good if you weren't there you better listen to it that's right twice right because he brought out some really good things one thing he brought out was about gifts gifts are not to be leaned on as a positive identification of where you are that's right gifts are given to you like a gift like a gift God gives you a gift and you open it and what it does is a surprise or it's something to enhance your Christianity not to say that you're a Christian right right I love that and I've never seen it that way before to it to explain it to somebody and you know brother random around about what he did explain after the Pentecostal but he really didn't say hey this is to enhance your Christianity not to say that you are a Christian because gifts and callings are without repentance but if you're a god-called person and God gives you a gift that's God working in you and through you with a gift right because remember Caiaphas had a gift he was black inside right he went to hell but he rejected the word he killed the word actually but he also prophesied that was a gift that he had that he could enter into Balaam had a gift that he could enter into speak to God he knew how to get an audience with God he knew how to make the right sacrifice be new and you know what it wasn't uncommon that he would get an audience with God right right so he had been getting an audience with God for a long time but that's the gift that he had that if he would have used it right then see let's just put it this way for an example if he would have been a born-again Christian he couldn't turn the word down like he did if Caiaphas would have been born again God in his soul see God would have used that gift and also he would have used the gift of the Holy Ghost then he would the gifts that went on top of that that would enhance your journey and I love what the brother said because that's what he meant if he didn't say that in words he meant that he it enhances your journey it doesn't prove your journey speaking in tongues don't prove you got the Holy Ghost right but speaking in tongues if it's a prophecy to somebody it's God using you to help somebody else right which is what virtue say so the first church age the first church age had these gifts and I want you to look now remember brother round and he'll explain and will not read it but right before this explanation brother Brown talks about looking at the pyramid on the back of a dollar bill the capstone's not on it even the pyramids in Egypt is not caps on them they're flat there's no there's no top or head on it all right because remember Jesus was rejected he was the headstone he was the head of the church so this is his head this is his body okay this is adoption this is not right this is not Paul wasn't adopted that's right but Paul was right here now you received the spirit of adoption right here right right right where you cry out by father our daddy daddy I'm crying for my daddy right here but you're not crying up here right you're speaking right you're speaking the word here this is what is What God Says now see remember on the River Jordan God identified who his son was not had become or already he was already a son but his identification came on the River Jordan the anointing for his ministry came and he preached for three and a half years well that man was this total pyramid right that man was this total pyramid even because he was the head of the church right The Headstone came in Jerusalem in April in a Manger right Born of a virgin say we and I know and I know it's right listen but brother Branham and brother Bill always quotes that he became the force of the godhead on River Jordan well I showed him a quote to other neighbor brother Brown said he was born the fullness of the godhead he was born because he couldn't he couldn't he could not gain any attribute God don't gain attributes right right that's right he grew into those attributes just like you do see that's the same way you do you don't have those attributes at your natural birth sure you may have some of these naturally but like brother Tim says like I said these are god-given these are nothing man you can't go to school you can't go to class and learn this in a university that's right just a School of Hard Knocks is the only way you're going to get these right right right right right yes if he was all the attributes he grew he grew and to me Jesus was not a dual person don't get me wrong you hear me he's not doing he's not two people right but there was a human part of Jesus not separate when he had to contend with the things on this Earth God never had to contend with the things on his earth like Jesus did when he was born a baby remember I told you though that Melchizedek stepped into a body spoke to Abraham turned into them Sada and went right back out of existence well he didn't go through life as a child he didn't have to eat sure they fed him a calf but he didn't have to Jesus had to eat Jesus had to breathe and all those things why that's what he chose to do God made his choices yep but he makes the right ones first we make choices and may make the wrong one first but he makes the right choice every time right so the you know what he said well I'd have done it a different way well no no you wouldn't if you was God that's exactly the way you'd do it the way he came but he had to come in human flesh to be our brother born a baby Holy Ghost was in him he was the Holy Ghost it's not that he it's not that he received the Holy Ghost he received an anointing for his ministry which is part of the Holy Ghost see remember you received baby form by father down here right baby baby daddy daddy I'm crying I need something because I don't have enough of these virtues to get into the Bible or get into the prophet's message and say oh that's what they're saying oh that's what that's meaning oh that's the way I'm supposed to live right if you don't see this in the journey like I was talking about the other day with Abraham if you don't see yourself in Abraham's Journey then you need a new birth I mean you just need to be born again you need to go back and say God I need to start right here when Abram was called out Abram was called out and you know what Abram came out he moved he was always moving always going somewhere all right so baby form Faith this same holy spirit is down here but this Holy Spirit here is not the same as this Holy Spirit here in you that's right as far as manifestation the Holy Spirit doesn't change ever he was the Holy Spirit that said let there be all right the Bible even said Jesus Christ created all things right so that was the Holy Ghost back in the back and back part of God's mind coming out speaking let there be right so Jesus didn't have a different Holy Ghost that's where people get these female Holy Ghost and male holy ghosts and two Lords and two this and do that no God was one God was Jesus Christ God all night all right there wasn't no other attribute somewhere else our Jesus would have displayed it all right so everything we need for our Earthly Journey God gives us at the new birth down here baby form Faith that's when you are born again and like I said before it happened in my journey it happened in Abram's Journey God was just giving him stuff he was just he was just if he say hey give a thing now sometimes you cry that's right yes and he says don't you know don't you know that you got to go through this right and this right see that's what don't you know that you got to go through these things most people in the message don't know that you got to go through this you've got to go through this to get even to get to where you can be raptured change of the body now remember truly down here you can be born again you're just a Eternal as God is that don't mean one thing you're boring me you're going in the rapture but you're not going to take a change of the body down here that's right right now or Paul would have took the change of the body right here that's why this message is so important because this message in its totality now listen to me and it's not just 63 to 65 in its total form is this because remember this was rejected and it's not come right okay that's why there's no head on the pyramid again say that again can you say that again Jesus came this is Jesus I wish I had that I saw one time there was a statue of perfect man uh picture with Jesus imprinted in here with his head right there and I can't find it anymore so if somebody finds it let me know all right but this is Jesus Jesus was born he was the fullness of the godhead Bobby he didn't have to be taught now listen in his Humanity had to be taught to walk and deliver that's his this outside man not a different man but this outside flesh had to learn how to walk and how to learn how to go to the bathroom he wore diapers just like her babies do he wasn't if he was any different than a human he could not die for the human race okay brother Brown said he was tempted in all points what about Mary Magdalene remember he lived with me if not he didn't listen uh no he didn't live with Mary Magdalene he lived in the same house because remember all him were together Lazarus Mary Magdalene Mary Morrison all in they were all together that's right well she was a prostitute don't you think he saw some things that maybe Roger you know tweaked his senses because he was a human but remember the Denver said me and you and me and him is is that I will as a human as a human and not born again I will entertain those thoughts and continue with the thought somebody understand that but see now with the Holy Ghost you can't help those knots coming but what you do is you do just like Jesus that's right yeah that's right you do just like Jesus did those thoughts will come he just the prince of the world is coming he has nothing in me well now what did that what's that good to tell you he will come right the prince of this world has come what in other words what the prince of this world Satan has come to Jesus and tempted him but he said he has nothing in me yeah I like what a good attempts at last week he said uh I'm a Christian I don't do them things and it kind of helps you in your mind I'm a Christian album that's right because the thoughts are going to come I I don't and that's where a lot of you have this battle you have this battle that no one having evil thoughts and then I'm evil this is the Devil's Playground he is allowed by the Fall to come into this thing right here yes right because remember Eve let him in here first right special cases all aside male and female you must process in your mind what you're going to do next now sure somebody says well I reacted and didn't think no no you there was a process there somewhere and like you know like male and female men and women you get the thought up here before the act happened right you have to get this thing going right that's what Eve did she got this thing going Satan got in this thing instead of this he couldn't get into her heart remember she was born she's not born again but she had to hold it up right she had she had an eternal life in her soul so they couldn't get to this he got to this and remember what she done was she reasoned on the word because she wasn't Maybe had all these working remember because brother Brown said she took her Human Side her feelings emotions Satan knew that part was weak you know I was thinking something the other day we talk about free moral agency let me tell you how Free Will agency works here you've got only two people on the Earth Adam and eat right right at that time when they were walking in eternity when they were walking in the garden in other words maybe not an eternity but walking in the garden there was no time right God would come down every day and talk to Adam and Eve is that right that's what the prophet said both of them not just one both of them Now Eve one often did what she did why didn't God Adam being a son why didn't Adam go be careful son your wife's fixing to do something wrong he couldn't do that that's right three more right absolutely so don't tell me that the Primo agency is gone in the end time that's what a lot of people say well you don't have three more life you just always was Adam Adam God if it was me God I said Adam be careful tomorrow your wife's fixing to do something you know God knew what was going on because I knew when he created him what they were going to do but he couldn't influence Adam he had to let Adam make a human choice absolutely right absolutely to display what was in God God always wanted to save somebody because he was a savior he always wanted to save somebody he always wanted to be the one that that comes and brings somebody out of something that's what a savior is right when you save somebody in the water what you do is you go down to where they are pull them up out of where they are and put them in the boat our problem is we jump out of the boat sometimes to get back in the water that's justification justification is that you know you're ready God will bring you out but you know you jump right back in but now when you receive the Holy Ghost when you come back out you're not going to jump back in yeah that's right but during your journey you may jump back to water a few times so just a little cute little analogy there but to display the attributes to display the attributes he had to allow Adam so look brother Brown said whatever he gave adam he gives you that's right so it's your choice but God knowing your choice by your free moral agency and everybody there's no way that God could allow somebody to go into heaven because of their own merits and their own thoughts and their own ideas that were in listen I'm not finished that were influenced by God nobody understand that because if God influences Bible says Bob you got to be this you gotta and then he doesn't this person over here say me right and then I see him standing at the wife don't judgment judging that's right not being judged and my thoughts are why did you go do that God and why did you not do it to me but no at the at the Judgment God's going to say Tuesday August the 24th 1973 I came to you yeah and you turned me down you know what that person's thoughts gonna be yes he did but I've shared my conscience so much I've got so far away from God I don't remember that but God that's to me brother Brown said God is just the Bible says God is just and to be just he had to give you a free moral agency right right now you'll hear Brother Brown say you didn't have anything to do with it I agree with that but you got to put it in the context of what he's speaking that's right because if we didn't have anything to do with it he did choose this one and not choose this right and that's unjust right right a judge can't come in and be unjust he's going to go by the laws that he set forth himself right so everybody it doesn't matter if it was from Adam all the way to the end time that's right has been given this free moral agencies he does by foreign remember you didn't have anything how many of us had anything to do with getting us here your Mom and Daddy got us here by yeah having an act and one met one and here you come well now that is the problems of God but like I've always said God knew when you got here that you would want it more than Joe blow out here I don't want to say that Joe Joe Jones or whoever so he had it waiting for you sure then he gave you an angel at Birth he knows these things but we don't see if we knew the end from the beginning we'd probably all go crazy yes wouldn't we if we knew the end from the beginning see that's where God knows all things he knows if he dumps on us all at one time Jesus is the only one that can handle this all at one time right that's right because he wasn't born of fornication he wasn't born of sin that's right he's born right the first time we need to be born the second time to get born right okay so let me finish this somebody else have a I just wanted you know me but I I was wondering what those attributes that he had as a young child he was probably a tender little boy he didn't feel no I think he threw roxions he's got a human side no Jesus Christ is the baby got whip yeah I'm just because you did didn't you you had to know what it was like delicious but now remember the Bible says he grew in Grace and knowledge right he was made perfect by the things he what there's your scripture right there if he didn't suffer why suffering doing something wrong right we suffer because we do something wrong our backside gets flattened and hopefully it connects to the brain and I believe no actually I'm sorry I don't believe that I believe he was a boy right up to being a boy I believe he you know played with you know sticks and stones and yeah he probably pulled the girl's hair and if he didn't he wouldn't know what to be if God made anything any more special then you beside being almighty God then he's got to come back as a different person nobody understand that yes he had to come by because you know people say well and that's what people in the message are saying they said well Jesus wasn't perfect because the Bible said he was made perfect by the things he suffered no he was made complete right exactly he was born with this the fullness of the godhead Bible okay that led him and got him guided him but he had a human side he had a human side now I'm not saying he had human nature but he had a human side that would allow him to get angry in a temple and run the people out to grow in Grace and knowledge and it says and favor with men so yeah he was a proper child I believe when he got older but when he was a kid he was just kidding he was just a kid you know he run around with the kids and I just believe he did kid things because remember even listen let me prove that even when he was 30 years old John the Baptist who was his first cousin did not know he was the Lamb of God right he had played with him I just read that quote the other day brother said God Jesus and John the Baptist played together and John never knew who he was so he was not so special now remember the Bible says John was filled with the holy ghost from his mother one so he was a special child not special you understand what I mean but but the Bible says he was born for a purpose remember he was real young and went out in the desert himself but remember he played with Jesus Christ himself and probably that day when he said Behold the Lamb of God because remember the Bible says that John he told John said John whoever you see the dove descend and remain now remember I believe he saw these other kind of fish and all these other priests remember they would always come and they were questioning I believe he could see the Holy Spirit go on those people but not remain yeah yeah because the conference the Holy Spirit would come on confidence and he would prophesy Holy Spirit would come on confidence and he would take the sacrifice in for the Year and God would honor that but the Bible says the Holy Ghost would come on and remain so he probably even saw Jesus he probably saw an anointing come one day and he said well it's not leaving yeah this must be the man that's why I told him in that crowd he said behold in other words look finally the Lamb of God has made itself known this is the man right here and I believed in John's in John's Humanity he said I've been beside him all along and didn't know who he was now tell me tell me that he will differ from that now Jesus was not different Jesus went through every form and condition we went through but without sin you and I are sinners that's right our nature is so close like Tim said our nature is so close to a beast nature because remember that's what came into the fall was the Beast nature that Beast nature came into the human race yeah right and it doesn't brother Brandon said without the Holy Ghost you're just a brute beast that's right you have a nature that's Fallen well see Jesus didn't have that nature to deal with but he was remember when he came into this world when he was born into this world he was born in Satan's domain he got older so he was he was he was uh susceptible to to everything that was in this Fallen condition even though he's a child listen you are you not born again right well you don't look any younger than 10 years ago that I saw you because this is a fallen condition but inside of me is eternal man that this 18 years old 20 years old that's the Paradox in the end time or all the way through actually is that God can indwell somebody and they still look old even Jesus that's why the scribes in them had a problem with this man they thought the Messiah was going to come like brother Brown said walk up to the temple yeah and live like a monk I guess you know you know no thoughts no bad nothing but they would watch Jesus he'd go ahead and talk to a prostitute they call him a wine they called him a wine Bearer he must have drank some wine he was a common man that there was no difference in him and me and you during his life except when he walked onto that River Brown said bears were God identified where he was so that was his identification brother Brown calls it this coronation day where God didn't give him the Holy Ghost to make him God he was all where he died but he got an anointing for his ministry so that now truly all these things are working in that man's life to its 100 percent do you understand what I said 100 because that's what we got to come to we got to come to this right here Martin Luther I believe there's people on Martin Luther's age that come to Bubbly Commons but not adoption no one has reached adoption except Jesus brother Branham and the people in the end time is the only people that's why I said I told you the other day real narrow up here at stop a lot of people born again down here and Through the Ages Paul irenius Martin all these Great Men brother Branham come to this place and had to come to this place before the next step comes that's what we were going to get into but we don't have time but we'll talk about this Holy Spirit next Sunday the Lord willing and then me and Bob both are going to be gone so um you want to do it on the what fourth fifth October 5th I'm gonna be in Mobile Alabama preaching for a little brother Matthew Bray and um tagging along he's gonna sing special he's gonna be George Beverly Shea so anyway right here it's where every Christian began since the day of Pentecost the 3 000 downstairs started right here now the 120 upstairs had been tutored by this headstone see because remember he said I will draw all men to me draw right right I'll draw them in not just as a new birth not just calling it neighbor but I'll draw because look if if God was here somebody's got to be here to draw right so Jesus had to be here he had to be the full expression of God the headstone remember when it was rejected then from then on all down Through the Ages you had that was that was all it would come everybody understand that now sure you get Divine love down here but it's not the fullness remember this is a headstone this is a this is the pyramid in itself but remember this pyramid can't be complete without that pyramid yeah got it see that's not a true pyramid but that is right that's a true pyramid what but you put the two together he's the head he controls the body so the Lord Jesus on on Mount Transfiguration brother Brown said it was now this is my beloved Son whom I please as well hear ye him it brings it down to a point all right on Sunset Mountain I believe that's the same thing happened to brother Brown brother Brown was took it up on a mountain took on the mountain a cloud Roselle's talking about a cloud of witness well that's our cloud of witness right there that cloud that's our crap that's our greater cloud of witness but brother random came to this because he had to come to this before you and I can come to him somebody had to there had to be a first group they had to be a first partaker so he first partook of it Jesus number one then run around them but now you and I could get a body change you got to be up here we can't take a body change right here there's nobody changing this because remember all those people are dead right there's only a few people that's going to reach that right there and even the ones that reach there have died Jesus died brother Brown died so there's got to be a special anointing in the end time that puts all this together reason brother Brown couldn't take a body change because I wasn't here yet the body is not complete without you oh yeah go ahead I thought Freda had her hand up she had her hand up because you had your hand up no I had my hand up okay um that's what people don't understand why Prophet at the time they had that's right
