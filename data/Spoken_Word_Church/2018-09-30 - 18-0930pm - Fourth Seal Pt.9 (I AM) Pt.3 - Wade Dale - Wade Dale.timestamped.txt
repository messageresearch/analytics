[21:56] and we lock the playground back and the
[21:59] keys were still in the playground and we
[22:01] only have one extra set and Joshes got
[22:03] it so without him you hadn't gotten the
[22:05] playground so adults do not give the

[23:06] 10:30 so if you can't go let's pray for
[23:09] him anyway I mean good to be in the
[23:10] house of Lord let's turn our Bibles to
[23:12] revelations chapter 6 continue our
[23:15] thought we had thought we might try to
[23:19] take it on to the son of man but I think
[23:23] we need to cover one more little point
[23:25] before we do and this will be I am the
[23:28] resurrection and the life part 3 we
[23:30] really hadn't got to that but remember
[23:32] as we were talking about last Sunday we
[23:35] must see a full restoration before you
[23:39] can even talk about a resurrection
[23:41] must be a full restoration because that
[23:43] there's been no when you say
[23:46] resurrection sure we've had
[23:47] resurrections I mean a permanent
[23:49] resurrection which means those people um
[23:56] Lazarus did not receive a permanent
[23:59] resurrection he was a temporary
[24:01] resurrection because he died again we're
[24:04] talking about this resurrection where
[24:05] there won't be any dying anymore amen so
[24:08] that's the resurrection that we're
[24:09] talking about because I want to show you
[24:11] two that we're brother Branham told us
[24:14] many times but it's been in the Bible
[24:15] forever that we're we're sitting in
[24:18] heavenly places as we speak today even
[24:20] all right so let's go to the Lord in
[24:21] prayer revelation 6 we're on the fourth
[24:24] seal everything culminates on this
[24:27] fourth seal for the Gentile what we
[24:29] called our Gentile age right there
[24:32] because there is more for everybody else
[24:34] there's more for the world there's more
[24:35] for the Jews there's more for the you
[24:38] know you got your millennium you got all
[24:40] these things but for the Gentile
[24:41] dispensation to be over there must be a
[24:44] resurrection full restoration or
[24:47] resurrection body change in a rapture
[24:49] alright okay and that will happen on
[24:52] this side on earth I believe it'll
[24:55] happen where we can see it I don't want
[24:58] to do I don't want to put it off like
[24:59] grandma well it's you know Lord's coming
[25:01] no he's here I always thought that the
[25:04] Lord was here you know we just got to
[25:06] realize that so let's pray you how many
[25:09] father we pray Lord that you will be
[25:10] with us today be the active participant
[25:13] in this service Lord you'd be the one
[25:15] that does the speaking but you wanted to
[25:17] does the hearing father just take care
[25:19] of the things that are all the things
[25:20] that the world Lord made just be shut
[25:22] off for a little while and as the as the
[25:24] priest that of old went behind the veil
[25:27] and the prophet of God told us that that
[25:30] curtain was there when that curtain shut
[25:32] the whole world was was blocked out he
[25:34] couldn't hear or see anything but you
[25:36] Lord the Shekinah glory that come down
[25:38] Lord and anointed that temple where lord
[25:41] now we know that that Shekinah glory is
[25:43] not in a physical temple as it would be
[25:47] wood and stone but it has moved into
[25:49] flesh and now Lord we come boldly to the
[25:53] throne and
[25:54] the petition of all the ones that are
[25:55] sick Lord that you would be with them
[25:57] that you would touch their bodies father
[25:59] the ones that are on the highways ones
[26:02] we're going to be on the highways Lord
[26:03] we pray that you'd be with them father
[26:05] take care of us now in this service
[26:07] anoint us for this journey Lord that we
[26:10] just think in a minute ago it's been a
[26:11] long journey for some but Lord it's all
[26:15] going to culminate one day to where that
[26:17] journey is gonna end and we're gonna
[26:19] live with you for an eternity Father
[26:20] forgive us Lord of our sins and bless us
[26:23] in Jesus name we pray amen
[26:25] and always bless the missionaries when
[26:28] the foreign field give them fruit for
[26:30] their labor when he had opened the
[26:31] fourth seal I heard the voice of the
[26:33] fourth beast say come and see and I
[26:35] looked and behold a pale horse and him
[26:37] he his name that sat on him was death
[26:40] and hell followed with him and power was
[26:42] given unto them over the fourth part of
[26:44] the earth to kill with a sword and with
[26:46] hunger and with death and with the
[26:48] beasts of the earth you may be seated in
[26:50] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[26:51] of the word let's go ahead and go to
[26:53] Joel let's go ahead and read those I
[26:56] like to read them because it really I
[26:58] think it maybe gets our mind in in order
[27:01] that that this is not a prophecy now
[27:04] this is a reality when it was written in
[27:08] Joel that was a prophecy Joel prophesied
[27:11] even when Peter comes up on the day of
[27:14] Pentecost and says this is that that was
[27:17] fulfilling that part of a prophecy but
[27:20] it wasn't fulfilling the whole prophecy
[27:22] cause back when Papa when Peter stood up
[27:25] and said this is down on the day of
[27:26] Pentecost a full restoration had begun
[27:29] but it had not come to full fruition
[27:31] okay it was in motion but it had not
[27:35] come to the apex and the apex is the
[27:38] statue of a perfect man with the
[27:40] headstone on the pyramid amen that all
[27:45] right so let's read Joel be glad you
[27:49] children of John resign and rejoice in
[27:52] the Lord your God we have given you the
[27:54] former rain moderately and he will cause
[27:56] to come down for you the rain the former
[27:58] and the latter rain in the first month
[28:01] the floor shall be full of wheat the fat
[28:04] shall overflow with wine and oil and I
[28:07] restore to you that's personally didn't
[28:10] say I was to them it says to you I will
[28:12] restore to you the years that the locust
[28:16] has eaten the cankerworm caterpillar
[28:17] Palma worm my great army which I sent
[28:19] among you and you shall eat and plenty
[28:21] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[28:23] the Lord your God that has dealt
[28:25] wonderfully with you and my people
[28:26] she'll never be ashame let's read John
[28:29] 12 23 through 24 and jesus answered them
[28:32] saying the hour is come that the son of
[28:35] man should be glorified verily verily i
[28:39] saying to you except a corn of wheat
[28:40] fall into the ground and die the son of
[28:44] man could not be glorified
[28:45] now that's before that's really what
[28:47] it's saying right son of man cannot be
[28:49] glorified but if it die it bringeth
[28:52] forth much fruit all right
[28:55] and Jesus said the hour is come that the
[28:57] Son of man should be glorified my
[29:00] brother Dale was talking about this
[29:01] morning we we have to bring the son of
[29:04] man is is the headstone and then the son
[29:09] of man is God in human flesh amen
[29:12] here not in another dimension but here
[29:15] amen and like we like we always say it's
[29:18] the capstone this looks just like a
[29:21] pyramid there's your pyramid there's
[29:24] your head and some of you know I want to
[29:27] bring it out just as easy as I can some
[29:32] of you last Sunday we're looking a
[29:33] little cross-eyed at me when I said
[29:34] Jesus didn't restore all things I read
[29:37] you the Bible that said he did but let
[29:40] me ask you a question
[29:41] talking about the Bible study this
[29:42] murder sentence cool this morning if
[29:45] Jesus came to restore all things when
[29:49] Jesus came out of the tomb what did he
[29:52] say all power in heaven and earth has
[29:57] been given unto me if he was if it not
[30:00] he was lying it's all power in other
[30:04] words before he before he was in the
[30:07] grave he had a flesh body that was human
[30:09] just like me in you right and it was
[30:13] deteriorating it was dying all right and
[30:16] then also he didn't know all things
[30:18] because when he went to the mountain
[30:22] only a prophet of God could tell us that
[30:24] why Moses and Elijah was there you
[30:28] remember what the Prophet said they were
[30:29] telling telling him about his second
[30:32] coming
[30:33] what is his second coming this coming
[30:36] hey man so they were telling him about
[30:39] that coming so there were certain things
[30:41] that he didn't know but when he stepped
[30:43] out of that tomb he had a flesh body
[30:45] that was glorified it can move between
[30:47] dimensions because remember our flesh
[30:49] body cannot move between dimensions
[30:52] brother branham's body was laying on the
[30:55] bed and he went into another dimension
[30:58] history - he did but he had to leave his
[31:00] flesh that mom and daddy brought had to
[31:03] stay in the ground that okay but Jesus
[31:06] walked out of the tomb he said all power
[31:08] and Hitler has been given unto me why
[31:09] didn't he just step over into another
[31:11] dimension and just take the devil and go
[31:12] put he's God he has all power he has no
[31:21] limitations why didn't he just go over
[31:23] and zap the devil amen don't you think
[31:27] like that way he said oh pound then they
[31:29] fit with me I said buddy we're done with
[31:31] you I can get rid of you right now but
[31:35] why did he not cuz he was not the one to
[31:39] restore all things he was not the one to
[31:43] restore all things he was the one to
[31:46] start the restoration but he was not the
[31:49] one to restore the Bible said even Jesus
[31:53] himself when he came down off the
[31:54] mountain he said surely Elijah will come
[31:56] and restore all things so it was given
[32:03] to a man the message was given to a man
[32:07] it had to be a man in human flesh amen
[32:13] we'll get into something in a minute
[32:15] that all right so just think about that
[32:17] though Jesus was not he made the way
[32:20] sure it's all got to do with Jesus all
[32:24] of it has to do with him
[32:25] without him nothing it hinges all on him
[32:30] but he transferred that power to
[32:32] somebody else
[32:34] because he knows he defeats the devil
[32:37] actually to him the devil's already
[32:40] defeated he created him so who's it left
[32:46] to its left to the bride it's left to
[32:50] the son of man the word in human flesh
[32:53] we'll look at it in just a minute I just
[32:55] want to give you something to maybe keep
[32:57] you a little bit away we may have to do
[33:00] German chocolate cake today we'll see
[33:05] man Lisa made some of the other day it
[33:10] was good John 11 Jesus said 25 says I am
[33:17] the resurrection and the life
[33:18] don't skip some of that he that
[33:21] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[33:24] shall he live and whosoever then
[33:26] believeth in me shall never die believe
[33:29] us now this all right amen
[33:33] believe it I am the resurrection and the
[33:37] life in other words mark that was saying
[33:40] Lord I know that he shall rise again in
[33:43] the resurrection at the last day she was
[33:46] doing just like everybody else she was
[33:48] pushing it forward to the future
[33:50] putting it on somebody else's shoulder
[33:54] and then Lord I know he'll raised at the
[33:58] last day and Jesus I'm sure Jesus just
[34:01] looked at her and said I'm the
[34:03] resurrection
[34:05] why are you looking for a later time I
[34:07] am the resurrection in the life but see
[34:11] that's what we got to see that if we're
[34:13] according to Romans 8 if we're heirs and
[34:15] joint heirs with Christ the joint heir
[34:18] that we get is what he got if he said I
[34:24] am the resurrection and the life we're
[34:26] heading toward that who said that the
[34:28] son of man said that the son of man
[34:31] stood on earth in a flesh body that was
[34:33] dying and said I am the resurrection and
[34:36] the life
[34:37] what part of that can we not see believe
[34:39] it's now this amen believe us now this
[34:43] that you and I have a part in this
[34:46] listen this whole resurrection thing
[34:48] hinges on a bride coming to perfection
[34:52] coming to arrest full restoration then
[34:57] all right men because Jesus made the way
[35:00] honestly he will ease the way the truth
[35:02] in the life he came remember remember
[35:06] brother Branham said he said Jesus
[35:08] didn't come to bring you an inheritance
[35:11] I've read that quote a hundred times
[35:14] Jesus did not come to bring you an
[35:16] inheritance he came to make a way to you
[35:20] to get back to your inheritance which
[35:23] our inheritance is that Genesis 1:26 man
[35:26] back before there was a fall that's what
[35:28] he gave us he gave us a way to get back
[35:31] to that because the way was lost in the
[35:35] garden so Jesus give us the way to get
[35:38] by but the way to get back is yeah it's
[35:40] him but it's through human flesh but not
[35:44] his flesh what a better way to defeat
[35:49] the devil instead of just being God and
[35:50] saying you know do away with you then to
[35:53] just say I think I'm just gonna take a
[35:54] bunch of people that's the devil that
[35:57] the devil don't think nothing of yeah
[36:00] it's kind of like the Sampson thing you
[36:02] know I'm gonna tell I'm not gonna take
[36:03] Samson Samson is not gonna be 64 and 320
[36:07] and benchpress a thousand pounds know
[36:09] he's gonna weigh about 90 pounds he's
[36:11] gonna look like somebody's accountant or
[36:14] is he near counting us in here that's
[36:15] okay look looks like somebody's
[36:17] accountant they set behind the desk all
[36:20] day in the middle of Atlanta hallelujah
[36:23] and he's going to destroy the world with
[36:26] us guy amen what better way to do that
[36:31] but no man tanks though that Samson was
[36:34] just great big you know Arnold
[36:35] Schwarzenegger looking thing
[36:37] why were they looking for its power of
[36:39] heat they knew where his power come from
[36:40] if you look like that but if you look
[36:42] like a little shrimp guy trust the same
[36:45] way it is with God he's going to take a
[36:46] group of people that doesn't look like
[36:49] to have any power at all and he's gonna
[36:51] live through them and work through him
[36:53] and destroy the devil through a ma'am
[36:55] and that's you done all right
[37:00] because watch we read this the other
[37:02] Sunday in Ezekiel let's go on down a
[37:06] little bit further remember let's
[37:07] remember the four things that we're
[37:09] doing now not to get too far ahead and
[37:11] remember number one death has to be
[37:13] destroyed
[37:13] number two a restoration of all things
[37:16] takes place a resurrection has to take
[37:19] place all right it's got to happen and
[37:22] then a rapture takes place on this
[37:25] fourth seal but the rapture remember the
[37:28] rapture is two what is rapture rapture
[37:32] means ecstasy it means being taken up
[37:35] into a different level right so that's
[37:38] what's going to happen because look I
[37:40] promise you if that's been destroyed in
[37:43] you if you've been restored back to
[37:47] where you can stand on the earth and you
[37:49] can control things like Adam did and you
[37:52] see the dead people come out of the
[37:54] ground and walk in among you don't you
[37:56] think what kind of ecstasy we're gonna
[37:58] have what kind of a caught thing we're
[38:00] just going to be caught soaked up into
[38:03] that so we're just going to be pulled
[38:05] over into another dimension we're just
[38:08] going to be pulled over into another
[38:09] dimension and let them destroy this side
[38:11] on this dimension then we're just going
[38:13] to step right back in this dimension
[38:14] amen
[38:15] so that's why it to me that I'm not
[38:17] looking for a rapture not anymore I'm
[38:21] not looking for a rapture the rapture
[38:23] will come but it will not come before
[38:25] these other three things happen amen so
[38:29] I'm looking for them first I'm trying to
[38:31] get away to where we can see that first
[38:33] and then the rapture will take place I
[38:36] promise you it'll have to take place
[38:38] they'll have to be a catching away but
[38:43] we were talking this morning June and
[38:44] I'm coming up the road we were watching
[38:45] them listening on a nominal Christian
[38:49] radio station and they only know what
[38:50] they know but they were like you know
[38:55] when the dead breaks out of the ground
[38:57] and when the trumpet sounds the Dave
[38:59] Lord's gonna come that's all they know
[39:02] they don't know that the trumps already
[39:04] sounded we've got that we are the
[39:09] recipients of that Christ has already
[39:11] come
[39:13] and the resurrection they're looking for
[39:15] is the same one Martha was looking for
[39:18] they know there's going to be a
[39:19] resurrection but they don't know about
[39:21] this resurrection this one is secret
[39:24] there won't be graves popped open no no
[39:28] that glorified body will come right out
[39:29] of there they'll walk through man what a
[39:34] power what a power that they were
[39:38] planted in corruption but they'll be
[39:39] raised in incorruption and they're not
[39:41] going back down again either we've seen
[39:43] people raised from the dead with their
[39:44] own very eyes but one day they're gonna
[39:46] put that man back in the ground as Tom
[39:48] Terry's but not when you see this Jen
[39:52] this resurrection this resurrection not
[39:54] the general resurrection
[39:56] that's what Martha was all about a
[39:57] general resurrection that's why all the
[39:59] all the believers in the world are
[40:01] teaching is oh there's gonna come a
[40:03] resurrection we're gonna see Christ I
[40:06] talked to a guy one time and that's all
[40:08] he could see was that he said well I'll
[40:10] be glad when I can look up in the sky
[40:12] and see the clouds
[40:14] you know the Bible said the clouds will
[40:16] break and Christ will come walking
[40:19] that's not the one you want to see
[40:22] that's still general that's when Christ
[40:25] comes to fight with for the Jews that's
[40:28] not when are you coming to get you and
[40:29] me you've already missed the
[40:31] resurrection you're supposed to if you
[40:33] see that one so see you unit but see how
[40:36] he understands that brother Dale said
[40:37] they've been taught wrong that can't
[40:40] restore there's no restoration in that
[40:43] that's just really putting it off for
[40:45] somebody else to do well I can do it but
[40:49] I know somebody no this is it this is it
[40:54] I will restore santé Lord and if the
[40:59] Lord's here then unit and you and I are
[41:00] part of that restoration right so death
[41:04] has to be destroyed or restoration of
[41:06] all things take place the resurrection
[41:07] has to take place and the rapture takes
[41:09] place on this fourth seal we're mover
[41:11] talking about spiritual death and
[41:13] spiritual death listen when brother Dale
[41:16] was talking about the church ages the
[41:19] spiritual death went and I see you which
[41:21] would be 6 in the 600's between 600 and
[41:24] 1500 when Martin Luther came in that was
[41:27] a long time that was almost 1500 years
[41:29] that it took for Satan listen for Satan
[41:33] to eat the word down with his dogmas and
[41:36] creeds and ideas amen
[41:40] then Martin Luther comes out preaching
[41:43] the just shall live by faith the
[41:44] two-shoes all right but it took that
[41:46] whole length of time for the corn of
[41:49] wheat to go in the ground and die but it
[41:52] didn't abide alone I mean you can't kill
[41:54] God he's always there I'd rather have
[41:57] one speck of God I'd rather have one
[41:58] cell of God than to have anything cell
[42:00] in the whole wide world just one cell so
[42:03] that one part of God live and don't get
[42:07] me wrong
[42:07] that fourth church age when all they did
[42:10] was live day by day to die that's right
[42:15] they lived the murders they live day by
[42:17] day to die because there were Christians
[42:19] they're just as much born-again
[42:21] believers as you and I sitting here
[42:23] today amen they just didn't have all the
[42:27] word to work with the word they had to
[42:29] work with was what they was told and
[42:32] what they read in whatever scripture
[42:34] there was at the time right but see you
[42:36] and I to restore all things then see we
[42:38] had to come to a place to where we had
[42:41] to have number one we had to have the
[42:43] word in our availability it had to be
[42:45] where we could get to it and then more
[42:48] important than ever there had to be a
[42:51] prophet come and be a word prophet and
[42:56] Elijah to restore all things according
[43:01] to what the Bible said
[43:03] jesus said surely Elijah will come and
[43:05] restore all things when I know other
[43:06] lives I did that except that one Elijah
[43:10] one never restored all things number two
[43:12] never restored all things number three
[43:15] introduced the Messiah that's all his
[43:17] job was okay amen but that fourth Elijah
[43:22] was the one to come in the last Church
[43:24] age and he was the one to come in our
[43:27] time and to not only bring us to the
[43:29] faith of the fathers but to bring us to
[43:31] Revelation that had been lost down
[43:33] through time because like real Adele
[43:36] said this morning that headstone was
[43:38] gone
[43:41] the top of the pyramid was flat amen but
[43:46] the headship which is the seven sealed
[43:49] to me it's the headship of this God's
[43:56] bending the headship of your heart since
[43:57] today of Pentecost amen
[43:59] I'll read it here in just a minute God's
[44:01] been the headship of the soul of man
[44:03] since since the 120 in the upper room
[44:06] right but see when the Son of man was
[44:09] here and when he said all power and
[44:11] heaven are given unto me he wasn't just
[44:13] God in his soul he wasn't just gone in
[44:18] his spirit he was gone in his flesh hey
[44:22] man that's what we want we got God in
[44:24] flesh here what's to stop us what's to
[44:30] stop us nothing now let's go and read
[44:40] let's just get that for me I don't wanna
[44:42] get too muddled up in some of the stuff
[44:44] I've been but I was gonna read the one
[44:46] where brother and let's talk about the
[44:47] the womb of the mine but yarder you
[44:50] ought to know that the woman your mind
[44:52] is where you lose it first
[44:53] man you lose it in the womb of your mind
[44:55] first
[44:56] all right you Satan gets in the womb of
[44:57] your mind and brother BAM says the only
[44:59] way we can ever be born again first and
[45:01] the womb of your mind receive the word
[45:02] then the Spirit comes on top of that it
[45:05] brings it to life there you are that's
[45:06] what it does so that's pretty simple how
[45:09] the new birth happens I was telling them
[45:11] this morning downstairs if you ever
[45:12] thought about this just give you it this
[45:14] is a little extra tidbit have you ever
[45:17] thought about this why didn't Matt why
[45:20] did the Holy Ghost come to Mary remember
[45:24] the angel come and said you will be what
[45:26] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost right and
[45:30] there will be conceived in your womb a
[45:32] child why didn't he say the father come
[45:37] it's all there the same person I know
[45:39] that but they have different operations
[45:42] they have different operations why did
[45:48] the Holy Ghost come and overshadow Mary
[45:51] why did Gabriel specifically say the
[45:54] whole
[45:54] ghosts will overshadow you and you'll
[45:56] bring forth the child very specific
[45:59] because that's what births you I you may
[46:05] not think anything about that but I bout
[46:07] had a running fit when I when I saw that
[46:09] that's what bursts you so it had to be
[46:12] the Holy Ghost overshadow Mary because
[46:15] what was formed in her was what the son
[46:18] of man but it was gone in human flesh
[46:22] same way with you the Holy Ghost
[46:26] overshadowed you one day and brought
[46:29] forth a child a baby at faith that's why
[46:35] we can be heirs and joint heirs with
[46:36] Christ whatever he gets is what we get
[46:41] he got birthed by the Holy Ghost guess
[46:44] what we get birthed by the Holy Ghost
[46:46] amen you and I have come to a place now
[46:49] to where all these ant questions are you
[46:52] wonder you and I did wonder because
[46:54] cousin even brother branham uses that
[46:56] analogy many times when he talks about
[46:58] you know the the Trinity because they
[47:03] said remember when Jesus grew up he said
[47:04] I came for my father then he'll go back
[47:08] to that verse that says Gabriel said the
[47:11] Holy Ghost over shouting and we know
[47:12] it's the same person but why didn't they
[47:15] say the father because the father's not
[47:17] that's not what bursts you own earth the
[47:19] Holy Ghost is what bursts you own earth
[47:21] amen so that's what birth Jesus that way
[47:24] we can be heirs and joint heirs with
[47:26] that man called Jesus whatever he got
[47:28] that's what we get now we were trapped
[47:31] and birthed the wrong way the first time
[47:33] we know that I hope that's plain but the
[47:36] second birth comes from the Holy Ghost
[47:39] burning out the old man in yot soul amen
[47:44] and then he comes running and then we
[47:49] cry Abba Father then we cry Romans 8 we
[47:54] go daddy daddy we need something you
[47:57] didn't cry for your daddy daddy when you
[47:59] was not born again
[48:00] oh yeah sure right at the time when you
[48:02] did but you went out there drinking a
[48:04] beer going well wonder what daddy God is
[48:06] doing today now you were talking
[48:08] daddy devils who you were talking to you
[48:11] were talking to your first day
[48:13] no birds birds was talking not your
[48:15] second bird that second birth took care
[48:17] a lot of those things amen I said a lot
[48:20] but not all because of this thank God
[48:23] for that too you know that explains a
[48:25] lot that helps you it ought to help you
[48:27] and your life knowing that some of the
[48:30] things that we do that are wrong we say
[48:32] are we born again see remember that's
[48:33] what sister Shepherd had a problem with
[48:36] brother Branham I the way you teach it
[48:40] yeah
[48:42] God said well I'll just give you a dream
[48:44] sister and I'll have a prophet here
[48:46] they'll tell you what it says and I'll
[48:48] give you the very man that is in that
[48:51] vision I'll give you the very man to
[48:53] tell you that you're okay
[48:55] that's what brother Branham said told
[48:58] her she was fine right that was her
[49:01] problem she was worried about things but
[49:03] when you put these things in order put
[49:04] the statue of a perfect man in now let
[49:07] me ask you a question that statue of a
[49:10] perfect man it's not fard the father
[49:14] he's perfect
[49:19] statue of a perfect man that man is you
[49:23] he shall know it's Jesus come on people
[49:26] we know that but he's already perfected
[49:29] he's trying to get you perfected he's
[49:32] trying to get me and you perfected amen
[49:36] that's the whole thing because truly you
[49:42] see that in other teachings or maybe
[49:44] even denominations
[49:45] well I'm perfect because Jesus is
[49:47] perfect I'm this but now I ain't perfect
[49:51] ain't nobody perfect you ain't perfect I
[49:54] ain't perfect ain't nobody perfect I
[49:55] hear that all the time
[49:56] well Christ my daddy said I was and if I
[50:02] go through the same channels he did
[50:05] it'll be all right he gave us the
[50:08] prescription and all we got to do is
[50:10] follow it I told him this morning I said
[50:12] everything we need for our body change
[50:13] for all these things that we're talking
[50:15] about we're not have to go to some
[50:16] mystery book to find it it's already in
[50:20] the Bible
[50:21] amen and we've already had temporary
[50:25] body changes we've already had people
[50:27] travel to time
[50:29] we've already had these things even in
[50:31] the Old Testament listen wherever anus
[50:34] is right now his body is different than
[50:39] what it was on the earth or he couldn't
[50:41] go to another in another dimension
[50:43] because flesh can't travel through
[50:45] dimensions it has to stay here Jesus
[50:49] didn't travel through dimensions until
[50:50] he got a body change amen so wherever it
[50:56] is that he got a body change comes
[50:58] remember he's our example whatever that
[51:02] is whatever you want to say he's
[51:04] something we're not in this dimension
[51:06] Philip Philip got transported Philip got
[51:11] transported from somewhere right on a
[51:14] cross the three Hebrew children got put
[51:24] in the furnace so hard it killed the
[51:25] people to put them in it and when they
[51:28] came out their clothes didn't even smell
[51:31] so they got a body changing their body
[51:33] and what the hell out so what I'm saying
[51:37] is we think oK we've been giving all
[51:41] this and now that body changes where he
[51:45] like on Mount Everest somewhere that we
[51:48] got to navigate it's already been
[51:51] navigated for us we just got to follow
[51:54] the plan but remember that was temporary
[51:59] this is not that was temporary with the
[52:04] three Hebrew children because they're
[52:05] laying somewhere dead in the grave
[52:13] but we won't because they weren't fully
[52:17] restored
[52:18] why did Izzy Keo tell us prophesy on a
[52:23] man and say to the wind thus that the
[52:26] Lord God come from the four winds o
[52:29] breath and breathe upon those slain that
[52:32] they may live and once the four things
[52:34] the four things were not given they were
[52:37] not parts given to an angel we're gonna
[52:42] cover something in a few minutes about
[52:43] that to hold that point remember Satan
[52:48] it's not a human
[52:50] Satan is an angel Satan's an angel he's
[52:54] not a human being he's an angel brother
[52:56] branham covers that up but I didn't
[52:58] breathe but Satan it's an angel he's a
[53:00] created being he was an angel but why
[53:03] didn't he kill talk about bones and
[53:06] sinew and meat and skin and breath
[53:11] because it's going to happen in bones
[53:14] and sinew in meat and in flesh and if I
[53:18] was preaching this somewhere else people
[53:20] would be shouting and they will be
[53:21] running the aisles but that's okay I
[53:24] know how y'all are it's gonna happen
[53:32] that way Ezekiel said it was going to
[53:34] happen that whoa that way listen so I
[53:36] prophesied as he commanded me and the
[53:39] breath came into them and they lived and
[53:41] stood upon their feet an exceeding great
[53:43] army then he said unto me son of man
[53:45] these bones are the whole house of
[53:46] Israel
[53:48] now they say our bones are dried and our
[53:51] hope is lost and we are cut off is that
[53:53] what we're standing today no therefore
[53:57] prophesy and say unto them thus saith
[54:01] the Lord God they go
[54:02] behold O my people I will open your
[54:05] graves and cause you to come up out of
[54:08] your graves and bring you into the land
[54:10] of Israel and you shall know that I am
[54:13] the Lord when I have opened your graves
[54:15] all my people and brought you up out of
[54:17] your graves and shall put myself and
[54:20] shall put my spirit in you and you shall
[54:23] live and I shall place you in your own
[54:24] land that you shall know that I the Lord
[54:26] spoken it and performed it staff the
[54:30] Lord now look the next thing well let's
[54:33] skip that skip the next go to the next
[54:38] quote I'm trying to build something up
[54:40] here just for a second remember we read
[54:42] in the restoration of the bride tree for
[54:44] death messengers killed it so forth life
[54:46] the messengers for life messengers has
[54:48] to bring it back now those life
[54:49] messengers are connected to what the
[54:53] Holy Ghost which is connected to thank
[54:57] you you can say you if you can see me if
[54:59] you want to but they connected to if you
[55:03] have the Holy Ghost today
[55:05] you have those four messengers working
[55:08] in you not working in an angel not
[55:13] working in this one are they working in
[55:15] you amen and if four messages of death
[55:19] killed the tree four messengers of life
[55:20] force toward the tree well where are
[55:22] those four messengers they're in the
[55:26] bride they're only in the bride they're
[55:29] nowhere else in the world but in the
[55:31] bride he's going to restore it so how's
[55:36] it going to restore by the four
[55:38] messengers in you because look even the
[55:49] four messengers of life brother Branham
[55:55] calls Martin Luther a human John Wesley
[56:01] a human the Pentecostal movement was
[56:04] begun by a man a human and then we had a
[56:08] human coming the end time the Elijah
[56:13] number four - what restore all things
[56:19] what was the fourth the word now I'll
[56:22] tell you this it was not just the word
[56:25] the word been there it was the Word made
[56:29] flesh
[56:30] it was a flesh word that stood at that
[56:33] was the problem
[56:34] the problem was is we had people reading
[56:37] this book
[56:42] without the oligo without the four
[56:46] messengers and then and that's the
[56:49] problem
[56:50] my brother Nell said false preachers
[56:52] bring false birth and that's what we see
[56:54] we see that manifesting now how people
[56:57] for 40 years preach this message I
[56:59] always thought man how does somebody
[57:00] preach 40 years in a congregation he has
[57:03] buried him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:05] Christ under the message of William
[57:06] Branham he's married him in the name of
[57:09] the Lord Jesus Christ under the message
[57:10] to William Branham he has brought him to
[57:13] the altar got born again under the
[57:16] messages of last hour and he's standing
[57:18] up their false prophet the whole time
[57:22] because remember he didn't get born
[57:24] again and then loses borning in
[57:25] experience and then deny the message no
[57:27] they wasn't something inside there to
[57:29] begin with amen so see that's the
[57:32] paradox that how God can use somebody to
[57:35] get you born again and they not even be
[57:38] born again think of my brother Ernie
[57:40] Villanueva about how the man that
[57:42] brought him to the Lord well you know
[57:43] you had to smoke that smoke a little pot
[57:46] had to take a little cannabis off to get
[57:51] anointed but brother only came in
[57:53] underneath that gifts and callings or
[57:56] without repentance there's your proof
[58:00] right there all these gifts you have all
[58:02] the gifts you want to it's like we were
[58:03] talking about this morning and I want
[58:06] you to see this because God works in
[58:08] human flesh but when Jesus was here on
[58:10] the earth and don't get me wrong I told
[58:13] him I said this is all over the internet
[58:15] so that's okay but I just don't approve
[58:17] of these prayer lines are fine but
[58:21] brother Brown never had never had a
[58:22] prayer line where people jump into
[58:24] screaming and throwing them down and
[58:25] pulling their hair and stomping them
[58:27] jesus never raised his voice brother
[58:29] Branham never raised his voice he was so
[58:31] under control
[58:34] supreme power in control so that in this
[58:38] screaming and jumping and shouting and
[58:40] trying to get people built up just
[58:43] tomorrow you know what they're back in
[58:45] the same place they were right set them
[58:49] down and teach them and that's okay if
[58:52] you want to scream and shout that's
[58:53] alright
[58:54] with me but what are you screaming
[58:57] shouting about
[58:59] because remember Jesus never had to
[59:03] scream at the devil if you have to
[59:06] scream at the devil you better be
[59:07] careful you may be like the seven sons
[59:11] of sceva Jesus we know Paul we know but
[59:17] we don't know you and you're doing
[59:20] something you're not supposed to be
[59:21] doing so we're just gonna teach you a
[59:23] lesson so they just yep and that's okay
[59:29] but that's what I'm telling you emotion
[59:30] is fine and getting that's okay we have
[59:34] to have certain things but to be fully
[59:37] to where we have to have a prayer line
[59:38] and you have to be throwing and spitting
[59:40] and throwing them on the ground and I've
[59:41] seen it you've seen it you don't need
[59:44] that you do not need that I'd rather
[59:49] have somebody stand up and look at me
[59:51] and say look the Lord and he'll tell him
[59:56] exactly what's going on like brother
[59:57] branham you know he he never shouted at
[1:00:01] nobody he was so in control that's the
[1:00:06] way I want it to be I like to shout
[1:00:10] about my salvation I like to cry about
[1:00:12] my salvation but you don't have to do
[1:00:15] that to get people healed hard to get
[1:00:18] people to the Oh you don't have to do
[1:00:19] that because remember God is revealed in
[1:00:30] human flesh but the devil can anoint
[1:00:33] your human flesh that's why that we've
[1:00:36] this that's why the full restoration has
[1:00:38] to come to where it's God restoring your
[1:00:42] flesh when God restores your flesh
[1:00:46] that's why would Jesus same way with him
[1:00:48] he said all power in heaven there's been
[1:00:49] getting unto me what that was God that
[1:00:52] was flesh that was all God but when he
[1:00:55] was walking and when Satan would come to
[1:00:57] him that was a human mortal man that
[1:01:01] Satan was talking to he was so hid cuz
[1:01:07] how could
[1:01:07] badi say if you be remember Satan said
[1:01:10] if you be the Son of God he oughta known
[1:01:12] he was but there was something different
[1:01:14] cuz you know what Satan was looking at
[1:01:17] he was looking at flesh just like he
[1:01:18] lives at you how in the world how in the
[1:01:22] world can that be a son of God I'm done
[1:01:25] okay that's okay how'd it work
[1:01:27] I'm kin that man son of God cuz I got a
[1:01:31] laundry list of things he did wrong last
[1:01:33] week
[1:01:33] Satan was right there going I went that
[1:01:35] one that one that one that one right
[1:01:38] so what's what we're moving to in
[1:01:40] restoration we're moving to what forget
[1:01:43] that that's not even so remember if
[1:01:48] Satan says anything he's a liar so
[1:01:50] whatever he comes and tells you he's
[1:01:52] lying but when our flesh is turned into
[1:01:56] the glorified condition Satan has no
[1:01:59] whole I brother Dale said when we leave
[1:02:01] this earth in a body changed in a
[1:02:03] rapture we can say we are truly born
[1:02:08] again cuz up until the change this comes
[1:02:11] from my mom and my daddy and it's dead
[1:02:13] this this part you see but the Bible I
[1:02:19] thought told us we were sitting in
[1:02:21] heavenly places now is it light or a we
[1:02:25] lying
[1:02:26] the Bible's not lying we might have a
[1:02:29] little problem though if we don't start
[1:02:32] seeing it that way
[1:02:33] amen but he's supposed to let's skip a
[1:02:37] few things to go down to number two
[1:02:39] proving his words talking about Luke
[1:02:41] seventeen thirty I'm going to hit the
[1:02:42] son of man just for a second but I want
[1:02:44] you to see something here right at the
[1:02:45] end we'll skip through a little bit a
[1:02:47] little bit of this everybody all right
[1:02:51] say man now after nineteen hundred years
[1:02:55] with the church age pass and all the
[1:02:57] things that prophesied of Luther and
[1:02:59] Wesley this is 1964 this is after the
[1:03:01] seal we just went through and seen it
[1:03:04] draw it out and the moon came down and
[1:03:06] drawed it out the Lord draw it on the
[1:03:07] board here and showed it come down and
[1:03:09] confirmed it after nineteen hundred
[1:03:10] years and we're at the layout of Stan
[1:03:12] Church aid he prophesied in Luke 17 30th
[1:03:16] at this same not a different this same
[1:03:21] a man would be revealed in the days like
[1:03:25] it was inside them upon the earth did
[1:03:27] you get it does it have to come to pass
[1:03:31] it's impossible now you understand
[1:03:33] that's not he's meaning it's impossible
[1:03:35] it's impossible for it not to come to
[1:03:37] pass now remember he come in three names
[1:03:39] the son of man a prophet the son of God
[1:03:43] the spirit the son of David for the
[1:03:45] Millennium but in between this conjunct
[1:03:48] conjunction now according to his own
[1:03:51] words in the day when the Son of man
[1:03:53] shall be revealed revealed himself as
[1:03:56] what not son of God we should have son
[1:04:02] of God some God should be just so clear
[1:04:04] to us that is the Holy Ghost that is
[1:04:07] that is God in spirit form but this son
[1:04:13] of man something we can see because
[1:04:16] remember we don't see the Son of God as
[1:04:18] then no man has seen God at any time but
[1:04:22] we see the son of man who declares who
[1:04:25] he is
[1:04:26] so what's the different you say well
[1:04:27] that's Jesus now that's you that's you
[1:04:31] that's the Son of God working through
[1:04:32] human flesh reveal himself as what not
[1:04:37] son of God son of man will reveal
[1:04:40] himself in a different way now if we
[1:04:42] believe what the Prophet said it must be
[1:04:44] a different way than we've seen it ever
[1:04:46] before I'm just telling you what he said
[1:04:51] let me read that one more time the son
[1:04:54] of man shall be revealed reveal himself
[1:04:55] as what not son of God son of man will
[1:05:00] reveal him his self in a different way
[1:05:06] everybody alright with that I'm just
[1:05:09] reading what the Prophet said in a
[1:05:12] different way so it's not going to be
[1:05:13] something that's the the norm that okay
[1:05:18] now let's read the next one number three
[1:05:21] in the very day that the Son of Man is
[1:05:25] revealed
[1:05:27] revelations 10 one two seven reading
[1:05:29] when you get home the seventh angels
[1:05:31] message what is it opening up the
[1:05:34] seals now see he didn't go to luke 1730
[1:05:37] on this one and he didn't go to Malachi
[1:05:39] for he went to revelations 10 that's
[1:05:42] when the seals are to be revealed
[1:05:44] this seals is the son of man okay I mean
[1:05:49] just for illustration purposes what
[1:05:51] birthed you the son of God birthed you
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:55] to the Church ages it was the son of God
[1:05:58] I just read that where is the son of man
[1:06:01] right here the son of man was the head
[1:06:06] walk it on the earth God in human flesh
[1:06:13] could it be God in your flesh
[1:06:17] revelations 10 one two seven reading
[1:06:19] when you get home the seventh angels
[1:06:20] message opening up the seals what is it
[1:06:23] not the angel is the son of man the
[1:06:26] brother branham was not the son of man
[1:06:28] we know that but the messenger is
[1:06:31] revealing the son of man can you get it
[1:06:34] separated now and I'll promise you they
[1:06:37] did not at first and still don't know
[1:06:40] brother Branham was not God listen
[1:06:44] brother Branham don't have to come back
[1:06:46] to bring us something that ain't already
[1:06:47] brought us okay
[1:06:51] I'm resting on that because remember I
[1:06:55] told you last Sunday he who prophesized
[1:06:57] must die brother Branham prophesied of a
[1:07:00] group of people to come sure he saw a
[1:07:03] part of it but remember he didn't see it
[1:07:06] all because he told him on the sixth
[1:07:08] seal or on the questions and answers he
[1:07:10] said you're not getting it it's not for
[1:07:12] you it's gone from you and there's no
[1:07:15] way you can get it what did he see he
[1:07:20] saw that spirit lift off of those people
[1:07:22] and go to a future group what are we
[1:07:27] looking at a future group are we looking
[1:07:29] at the reality of it are we are we
[1:07:32] looking at a vision are we in the vision
[1:07:34] a man are we looking at something are we
[1:07:37] in it
[1:07:38] brother basical was two hours in a
[1:07:40] vision before he realized he was making
[1:07:42] that vision
[1:07:43] come to pass because remember a vision
[1:07:47] if it's from God has to come to pass a
[1:07:52] vision from God now I tell my visions
[1:07:54] from meeting by a vision from God has to
[1:07:57] come to pass
[1:07:58] that's why brother Branham could depend
[1:08:00] on that's why Jesus could depend on
[1:08:02] visions brother Branham said Jesus saw
[1:08:04] Lazarus raised four days before he raved
[1:08:06] now what kind of confidence is that
[1:08:08] that's a lot of confidence when you can
[1:08:10] say I was telling them downstairs when
[1:08:12] you can know exactly what's going to
[1:08:13] happen tomorrow by a vision tonight and
[1:08:15] you know what's gonna happen tomorrow
[1:08:17] where's the fear at there's no fear you
[1:08:23] know what we're looking at our problem
[1:08:25] is we're looking at the Bible as a
[1:08:27] vision we're looking at the prophets
[1:08:29] message the division not a reality
[1:08:32] because God remember God's what his
[1:08:35] thoughts become expressed his thoughts
[1:08:39] become Express the vision is now what
[1:08:43] we're walking in because if not then
[1:08:46] we're prophesying we're speaking of
[1:08:49] something to come we can't do that we
[1:08:54] can't think this mountain is so high we
[1:08:58] always tell them this morning you know
[1:08:59] the Bible says doesn't say thus saith
[1:09:02] the Lord if you speak to this mountain
[1:09:05] it says you you speak to this mountain
[1:09:10] and not doubt in your heart see that's
[1:09:14] our problem we've made this thing a
[1:09:15] mountain we've made it a mountain that
[1:09:19] we can't get over until we you know
[1:09:22] that's the problem I'm just gonna say it
[1:09:23] that's the problem I have with people
[1:09:25] that think brother Browns got to come
[1:09:27] back they're just pure lazy they have no
[1:09:30] revelation they are pure lazy people
[1:09:32] because you know what they're doing
[1:09:33] they're throwing it well I'm just gonna
[1:09:35] sit here until he gets back and then
[1:09:39] he'll tell us hogwash that's the lie the
[1:09:42] devil because you know what the devil
[1:09:45] wants you to do he wants you to believe
[1:09:46] that I want the son of man here these
[1:09:53] son of man he called it the son of man
[1:09:57] and when these son demands here they
[1:09:58] can't be another man here not the angel
[1:10:04] is the son of man but the messenger is
[1:10:07] revealing the son of man can you get it
[1:10:10] separated down that's where it seems to
[1:10:12] be so hard for you see he was picking up
[1:10:14] their thought not the son of man himself
[1:10:17] but the seventh angel the seventh
[1:10:20] messenger is revealing to the public the
[1:10:22] Son of Man because it's left the shuk he
[1:10:26] can or you can't organize the son of man
[1:10:29] now they have organized part of the Son
[1:10:31] of God
[1:10:32] cuz in the denominations that was the
[1:10:35] Holy Ghost come okay but was but God
[1:10:39] winked at their ignorance because it was
[1:10:41] not a full restoration going on but now
[1:10:44] with the full restoration if it's the
[1:10:46] grain you can't go backwards you can't
[1:10:50] put the grain back in the husk back in
[1:10:54] the stock back in the it's all dead it's
[1:10:59] all dead the grain is all that's left
[1:11:02] and that's me in you my screaming at you
[1:11:06] you okay alright get you some get you
[1:11:09] some earplugs my brother Larry's got
[1:11:10] over I'm just glad you don't wear them
[1:11:14] kind of looks like your muffs
[1:11:16] that'd be a little and that's okay from
[1:11:19] if he hears hurt that's no problem I
[1:11:21] know I talk loud but that's another
[1:11:27] thing we were talking about this morning
[1:11:28] they you know God's not deaf you don't
[1:11:31] have to scream to God you don't he deaf
[1:11:36] just talk to him what did Jesus tell
[1:11:40] them he said he said beware of the ones
[1:11:42] that stand in the street corner and
[1:11:43] declare didn't tell everybody who they
[1:11:48] are what they're doing he said he will
[1:11:52] not you know What did he say he said
[1:11:55] those that are that way will get their
[1:11:57] reward but the ones that do it in a
[1:11:58] quiet place God God will come and reward
[1:12:01] them that's kind of paraphrasing but to
[1:12:03] me that's what I believe he'll I know if
[1:12:06] yeah if you pray in secret he'll honor
[1:12:08] you in the public you don't want an
[1:12:09] argument
[1:12:10] public now no you don't want go the
[1:12:12] other way that all right so we can't
[1:12:17] organize it you can't denominator tell
[1:12:21] us the grain and what is the grain the
[1:12:24] grain is me and you where's the grain
[1:12:28] we're the wheat we're not the plant were
[1:12:31] the seed that all right we've went
[1:12:34] through the plant we went through all
[1:12:36] these stages this is the last stage it
[1:12:39] can't go back in the ground mm-hmm all
[1:12:42] right let's go number four it was the
[1:12:44] rising of the Sun we read this last
[1:12:47] Sunday we'll read it again cuz I want to
[1:12:52] get to something right here in just a
[1:12:53] second he was waved at the day of
[1:12:54] Pentecost when there cometh sound from
[1:12:56] heaven like a waving mighty rush you in
[1:12:58] and was waved over the people the
[1:13:00] Pentecostal people that was up at
[1:13:02] Pentecost waiting for the blessings to
[1:13:04] come and to be waved again we realize in
[1:13:08] the last day now not to be waved again
[1:13:11] Pentecost 1906 that's not what he said
[1:13:15] Luke 1730 is not 1906 Azusa Street
[1:13:19] Pentecost
[1:13:20] hello he seems to be waved according to
[1:13:25] Luke 1730 because the son of man didn't
[1:13:29] come back on the day of Pentecost in
[1:13:31] 1906 Azusa Street that was the Son of
[1:13:34] God that was the Holy Ghost falling on
[1:13:35] the people giving them what giving them
[1:13:39] the gifts giving them the higher we read
[1:13:42] it and I think we may read it in this
[1:13:43] again no we read it before with Lutheran
[1:13:45] Westland penticoff it was a higher form
[1:13:47] of what God was doing you know I've
[1:13:51] always thought about this tuna you know
[1:13:53] if God would have went from Luther to
[1:13:54] Wesley to brother branham they nobody
[1:13:57] would ever accepted him but it went
[1:14:00] Luther Wesley Pentecost
[1:14:02] brother Brahms slid in with those
[1:14:05] Pentecostal people and then he was
[1:14:07] accepted because remember the Lutheran's
[1:14:10] didn't accept him in the Methodists
[1:14:11] didn't accept him but the Pentecost was
[1:14:13] accept him so they give him a little
[1:14:15] platform see God's all knowing he knew
[1:14:17] what we would do he knew we'd reject him
[1:14:19] if he just come right out of a Lutheran
[1:14:20] Church but he come in with the
[1:14:22] Pentecostal people
[1:14:24] the gifts and the signs and the wonders
[1:14:25] but remember that was just debate that
[1:14:30] wasn't the son of man that was the son
[1:14:31] of God working healing the people doing
[1:14:35] those things but in the day when the Son
[1:14:38] of Man is to be waved over the people in
[1:14:41] the Sun in the Sun day again and the day
[1:14:44] that the Esso end of man will be
[1:14:46] revealed or waved again over the people
[1:14:48] now who is the son of man in the
[1:14:51] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:14:54] with God in the Word was God
[1:14:55] let's read this again in the beginning
[1:14:57] was the Genesis 1:26 man and in Genesis
[1:15:00] when 26 man was with God and the Genesis
[1:15:04] 1:26 man was God and in Genesis 1:26 man
[1:15:08] was made flesh and dwelt among us that's
[1:15:11] why I love Genesis 1 you can put Genesis
[1:15:12] 1:26 all through the Bible it's God
[1:15:16] Almighty doing his work cuz remember
[1:15:20] that Genesis 1:26 men didn't fall man
[1:15:24] fell in flesh didn't fall in Genesis
[1:15:25] 1:26 men that Genesis 1:26 man can't
[1:15:28] fall
[1:15:28] that's Almighty God but that Almighty
[1:15:32] God was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:15:34] and if all the teaching that we have in
[1:15:36] confirmation of the word of God by word
[1:15:38] of god by signs by wonders that was
[1:15:41] confirming his message alright that we
[1:15:44] just who was at least eastwood up by
[1:15:48] wonders we see today that in the Book of
[1:15:50] Luke here that as we just quoted from
[1:15:53] the or the Luke 17 and the 30th verse
[1:15:55] and Malachi 4 in the different
[1:15:57] scriptures that we are acquainted with
[1:15:58] that that word again is waved over the
[1:16:01] people that the dead traditions of man
[1:16:03] is dead and the Son of God is alive
[1:16:06] again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:08] right among us and giving us life as
[1:16:12] Christ was the first one to raise from
[1:16:14] all the prophets and so forth although
[1:16:17] topped in many places he was the first
[1:16:19] fruit of those that slept in the bride
[1:16:21] coming of Christ coming out of the
[1:16:23] church because we're not a church where
[1:16:25] the bride there has to be a sheaf waved
[1:16:28] again in the last days oh my waving of
[1:16:31] the sheaf what was the sheath the first
[1:16:34] one that come to mature the first one
[1:16:37] that prove
[1:16:37] it was a week that proved it was a
[1:16:40] sheath hallelujah I'm sure you see what
[1:16:43] I'm talking about
[1:16:44] I hope you see what I'm talking about
[1:16:49] because we're under let me see if we say
[1:16:56] this without that sheath wave was
[1:17:02] important because it was the first thing
[1:17:05] if you don't understand I explain it
[1:17:07] like Sunday I was planning in the priest
[1:17:10] walked out into your field looked across
[1:17:13] the entire field and usually it was
[1:17:14] barley or wheat or corn in that day and
[1:17:18] he would see a group are a few stalks
[1:17:22] that was higher than the others that
[1:17:25] because I'll wait you know your whole
[1:17:27] field up mature at the same time even in
[1:17:29] the natural you know even in the
[1:17:30] spiritual your whole field don't mature
[1:17:32] at the same time but there is the first
[1:17:34] fruits that have come out and shown the
[1:17:36] fruit or the wheat or whatever you want
[1:17:39] to call it barley so the priest would go
[1:17:42] out there and cut those stalks off the
[1:17:44] highest of the first one to come to
[1:17:46] maturity he cuts
[1:17:48] they didn't cut the whole field down the
[1:17:50] whole field wasn't ready
[1:17:51] alright the whole field if he cut the
[1:17:53] whole field down he runs it but he only
[1:17:56] cut down what was mature he took that
[1:17:59] step back and he waved it over the whole
[1:18:03] field showing that something had come to
[1:18:07] maturity but that this whole field now
[1:18:12] the whole field the whole whatever
[1:18:14] million acres thousand acres or five
[1:18:17] acres that now that what will happen is
[1:18:21] they will accept that whole field
[1:18:23] because it's going to come to maturity
[1:18:25] just like these day if these come to
[1:18:27] maturity and it's the same kind of plans
[1:18:30] everybody listen to what I'm saying and
[1:18:31] it's the same kind of plan it will come
[1:18:35] to maturity so Christ was waved over the
[1:18:39] people he's the first one to come to
[1:18:41] maturity okay brother branham being the
[1:18:44] high priest not the chief wave hello
[1:18:49] you can't wave
[1:18:51] william branham over the people its
[1:18:54] Christ waved over the people by the
[1:18:56] priests saying that hey these are coming
[1:19:02] that all right hallelujah
[1:19:06] I'm sure you see what I'm talking about
[1:19:07] I hope you do it was waved over what the
[1:19:10] people the people the human flesh people
[1:19:14] and the first time there will come forth
[1:19:19] for the bride age that's Yoona for a
[1:19:22] resurrection out of dark
[1:19:23] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:19:28] the full maturity of the word has turned
[1:19:31] back again in its full power and being
[1:19:35] wave not a person being waved over the
[1:19:37] people the full mature word is waved
[1:19:41] over the people by the same signs and
[1:19:45] the same wonders that he be did by them
[1:19:47] because I live you live also speaking to
[1:19:50] his wife because I live you live also
[1:19:53] what a resurrection that that was and
[1:19:55] what a resurrection this is to be
[1:19:58] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[1:20:00] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[1:20:02] power he was waved to them the word
[1:20:05] which he was was waved back to them on
[1:20:08] the day of Pentecost the word made
[1:20:11] manifest now and as I say it is to be
[1:20:14] waved again what the word the words to
[1:20:18] be wave now and as I say it's to be
[1:20:22] waved again in the last days everybody
[1:20:25] all right with that same am now let's
[1:20:28] get back to our little box we were
[1:20:30] talking about let's go to number 6
[1:20:32] remember we all got a box
[1:20:34] we all got a box to work in Luther Lucis
[1:20:37] got loots her brother Brown said Luther
[1:20:38] had up he couldn't do nothing else but
[1:20:41] what was in that box I've read you that
[1:20:43] quote for like six weeks so I ain't
[1:20:45] gonna read it again but brother Brown
[1:20:46] said they have something to work in and
[1:20:48] that's all they got to work in that's
[1:20:50] all they can work in so we have a box
[1:20:53] and then we have a box to work in what
[1:20:55] is our box
[1:20:58] so that's weighted again today God is
[1:21:00] calling his elected people and they are
[1:21:04] elected now and
[1:21:05] now they are elected for what he didn't
[1:21:09] say a rapture he didn't say a body
[1:21:12] change German chocolate cake now they
[1:21:22] are elected for what for a resurrection
[1:21:27] and what kind of sign is he showing them
[1:21:31] resurrection sign what was he showing
[1:21:36] them then a delivering sign that he's
[1:21:39] talking about Moses to deliver them from
[1:21:41] the bondage the sign a power that could
[1:21:43] shut to heavens or could black the skies
[1:21:45] and now now I didn't read little that I
[1:21:50] should and now he's showing the power of
[1:21:52] the resurrection of his son living among
[1:21:54] them to resurrect them from this grave
[1:21:57] and graveyard that we're in now brother
[1:22:01] Brown went in the grave at that time so
[1:22:03] he's talking about something spiritual
[1:22:05] spiritual graveyard right to resurrect
[1:22:09] them from this grave and graveyard that
[1:22:12] we're in to the land that he promised
[1:22:14] this resurrection sign calling out a
[1:22:17] spiritual egypt and spiritual Babylon
[1:22:21] what are we elected for anybody ever say
[1:22:24] this is worthy legs and ask you ask
[1:22:26] people in the message say if you're the
[1:22:27] elect what do you like it for 99 percent
[1:22:32] of the people will look at you just like
[1:22:34] some of you look at them read them that
[1:22:38] quote you're you are elected for a
[1:22:41] resurrection let's go to the next one
[1:22:44] super sign 1963 we've had all these
[1:22:49] other things the paths of abraham's
[1:22:51] royal seed has come up that same path
[1:22:53] that abraham come up now what remember
[1:22:57] who do you meet he met God in human
[1:22:59] flesh he melt Melchizedek alright but
[1:23:04] just before the destroying of the world
[1:23:06] the super sign must appear again an
[1:23:09] eternal everlasting resurrection sign
[1:23:16] now once stop right there
[1:23:19] a lot of people under brother branham's
[1:23:21] ministry receives a temporary
[1:23:22] resurrection not an eternal one in their
[1:23:27] body in their body not in their soul I'm
[1:23:29] talking about the body because here what
[1:23:31] is he talking about just before the
[1:23:33] story in the world the super sign must
[1:23:34] appear again an eternal everlasting
[1:23:39] resurrection sign so this is not
[1:23:41] temporary this is an eternal I like that
[1:23:44] word an eternal everlasting resurrection
[1:23:47] sign that proves that the royal seed
[1:23:50] could not be killed come on people could
[1:23:53] not be killed like Daniel and like the
[1:23:57] rest of the prophets was the grave
[1:23:59] couldn't hold him because what the
[1:24:01] others listen I love this he could be
[1:24:05] the only one who can say it this way the
[1:24:07] others conquered the gates of the
[1:24:09] enemies such as fire three Hebrew
[1:24:11] children line Daniel and sword down
[1:24:16] through the ages and so forth they
[1:24:18] conquered that you won't help me read
[1:24:23] the rest of that but this royal scene
[1:24:26] you show that was Jesus all right Romans
[1:24:31] 8 said we're hairs and joint-heirs or
[1:24:32] whatever he gets we get all right here
[1:24:34] we go
[1:24:36] but this royal seed conquered death hell
[1:24:40] and the grave nothing could hold him why
[1:24:44] he's an everlasting super son what is a
[1:24:49] super sign the resurrection of Jesus
[1:24:51] Christ look after being dead for 2,000
[1:24:56] years he was not talking about the
[1:24:59] resurrection 2,000 years ago he's
[1:25:02] talking about what a resurrection this
[1:25:03] is after being dead for 2,000 years
[1:25:06] remember Christ has come down off the
[1:25:07] mountain and he said tell the vision of
[1:25:09] no man till the Son of man be what risen
[1:25:11] again that's what he's talking about
[1:25:14] right there he's actually telling you
[1:25:16] the scripture in Matthew right here the
[1:25:19] resurrection of Jesus Christ after being
[1:25:21] dead for 2,000 years still stands in the
[1:25:24] midst of us the same as he did then
[1:25:28] manifesting myself in his Church in
[1:25:31] human
[1:25:33] flesh he's the same yesterday today and
[1:25:37] forever now you say well brother wait
[1:25:42] now that's good all that swelling good
[1:25:44] but but what are we looking for let's go
[1:25:52] to the next one conflict between God and
[1:25:55] Satan roll on down to 26 then on the day
[1:26:05] of Pentecost now this is back in
[1:26:09] Pentecost of 80 30 then on the day of
[1:26:15] Pentecost he sent back the earnest of
[1:26:18] this place let's read this he sent back
[1:26:23] the earnest not for restoration he sent
[1:26:27] back the earnest of this place now that
[1:26:31] place is capitalized so he must be
[1:26:33] talking about a place that to me is
[1:26:36] different than just saying this place
[1:26:38] the assurance the evidence that this
[1:26:41] land and they capitalized the Ale this
[1:26:45] land is real just like Joshua brought
[1:26:50] back the evidence Jesus brought the
[1:26:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:56] now we reckon ourselves dead turns up
[1:27:01] cake for those of you have not been here
[1:27:05] German chocolate cakes my favorite so
[1:27:08] when you start going to sleep I'll say
[1:27:09] Germans aggragate and everybody was up
[1:27:11] the wall I want some give me a piece
[1:27:13] now we reckon ourself dead we're buried
[1:27:17] with him in Baptism unto his death and
[1:27:20] we raised with him now watch we raised
[1:27:23] with him , in the resurrection you say
[1:27:26] oh that's great that's have no problem
[1:27:28] he's not finished he's not finished and
[1:27:32] now we are in already not we're going to
[1:27:39] where we're already raised oh my where
[1:27:44] now not will be we are now
[1:27:46] not sitting in heavenly places how in
[1:27:50] Christ Jesus not we will be some other
[1:27:54] time we are now the church don't realize
[1:27:59] who they are see we are now right this
[1:28:03] minute how in Christ assemble together
[1:28:05] in him already raised from the dead our
[1:28:10] soul was immortal you're sitting here
[1:28:14] today with the baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:28:16] your soul is immortal can't die never
[1:28:19] weld I never did died and ever did
[1:28:20] anything wrong can't be judged never
[1:28:22] will be judged amen all right thereby
[1:28:31] okay with that now let's talk just for a
[1:28:35] minute I'm gonna set this up for next
[1:28:37] Sunday just for a few minutes let's go
[1:28:38] to first Corinthians 6 now let's go back
[1:28:46] to my analogy of Jesus when he came out
[1:28:49] of the grave he said all power and
[1:28:50] heaven earth been given unto me in other
[1:28:52] words I'm going to transfer that power
[1:28:53] to my bride cuz I'm not gonna destroy
[1:28:56] the devil in me one person that would be
[1:28:58] too easy I'm gonna let a group for
[1:29:02] people struggling strain and and and
[1:29:05] make it just glorious amen
[1:29:08] and remember what I said about the devil
[1:29:10] the devil it's not a human the devil is
[1:29:14] an angel thereby okay without the devil
[1:29:17] is an angel he's not a human dare any of
[1:29:22] you having a matter against another go
[1:29:23] to the law before the unjust and not
[1:29:26] before the Saints in other words if you
[1:29:28] have a problem with Joe Blow out there
[1:29:30] hitting you in the car yeah if you need
[1:29:32] to take him to court but if we got a
[1:29:34] problem in this church it needs to be
[1:29:36] settled in the church and there is a
[1:29:38] scripture that says take it to the least
[1:29:42] don't take it to the pastor it says take
[1:29:45] it to the least among you to be judged
[1:29:48] don't you take a brother of the court
[1:29:49] you do you use just not right it never
[1:29:53] has been never will be do you not know
[1:29:56] that the Saints
[1:30:00] now who's the saint everybody's born
[1:30:05] again is the same do you not know that
[1:30:09] the Saints shall judge the world and if
[1:30:15] the world shall be judged by you are you
[1:30:18] unworthy to judge the smallest matters
[1:30:21] know ye not that we shall judge angels
[1:30:26] how many times have you read that many
[1:30:31] times right have you ever thought about
[1:30:33] that angel being the devil because
[1:30:39] listen if God's gonna throw him in the
[1:30:42] lake of fire why didn't he just do it
[1:30:44] when he came out of the grave
[1:30:49] there was no judge sure he's the supreme
[1:30:53] judge but he's judging he can't break
[1:30:55] his krypter he has to judge for you know
[1:31:01] you not that we shall judge angels how
[1:31:03] much more things that pertain to this
[1:31:06] life amen we shall judge angels listen
[1:31:11] to this let me I found this in Daniel
[1:31:14] you know let's read this they don't have
[1:31:18] it but Daniel 722 talking about the
[1:31:21] Ancient of Days it's not gonna be on the
[1:31:23] screen because they don't have it the
[1:31:25] Bible says in 722 of Daniel says until
[1:31:28] the Ancient of Days came and judgment
[1:31:31] was given to the Saints of the Most High
[1:31:36] and the time came that the Saints
[1:31:38] possessed the kingdom Ancient of Days
[1:31:42] come and judgment was given to the
[1:31:45] Saints of the Most High
[1:31:47] that's why God that's why Jesus Christ
[1:31:51] couldn't destroy the devil could that
[1:31:53] scripture right there if we even judge
[1:31:58] angels and Satan as an angel oh my look
[1:32:06] at what we got here we come to a place
[1:32:09] to where we say well we're nothing sure
[1:32:11] we're nothing but but Jesus Christ
[1:32:13] give it all to us he's given to us and
[1:32:17] he wants us to do it in this dimension
[1:32:19] it would be real easy to do in heaven
[1:32:22] all the glory and the bliss and huh no
[1:32:25] do it down here right in Satan's Eden
[1:32:27] right in his own palace
[1:32:29] oh he can't remember the old analogy you
[1:32:36] know Satan came into God's Eden and
[1:32:38] messed up God's program we didn't mess
[1:32:41] up his program he fulfilled it but now
[1:32:44] what God has sent us right into Satan's
[1:32:47] Eden to bring us back out and take us
[1:32:51] into Eden again
[1:32:52] all right let's read right here that was
[1:32:55] one man that knew about death and life
[1:32:59] and the whole Bible his name was Joe
[1:33:04] it's all this all this body change stuff
[1:33:06] is really new
[1:33:11] all right let's read job 14 and then
[1:33:17] we'll be done but man dies and wasteth
[1:33:20] away
[1:33:21] yeah man giveth up the ghost and where
[1:33:24] is he as the waters failed from the sea
[1:33:28] and the flood to chaos and dry thought
[1:33:31] so man lies down and rises not till the
[1:33:35] heavens be no more
[1:33:37] they shall not awake nor be raised out
[1:33:40] of their sleep now that's what jokes all
[1:33:46] remember that's what he saw he sees
[1:33:48] people die and he never saw him come
[1:33:49] back because remember the analogy is he
[1:33:52] sees the tree every winter come back
[1:33:54] died come back Diane come back he said
[1:33:56] man dies don't come back but watch all
[1:34:01] that thou would us hide me in the grave
[1:34:03] that thou would us keep me secret until
[1:34:08] thy wrath be passed you know I was
[1:34:11] thinking we ought to get friend of ours
[1:34:14] died Terence and now we're acquainted
[1:34:16] with him and he passed away at 57 years
[1:34:19] old but but I believe I know Terence
[1:34:21] believes - he's but he was well this is
[1:34:24] the quote I'll tell you the quote that
[1:34:25] demands
[1:34:26] at the funeral home the man come up to
[1:34:28] Terrance and said Johnny really thought
[1:34:30] a lot of you that I really tried to get
[1:34:31] him not to but but that's just the way
[1:34:35] they are but now people like that's good
[1:34:37] to us
[1:34:37] I believe God won't forget that you said
[1:34:41] it was sad that he died was it he just
[1:34:46] got hid
[1:34:49] he just got preserved in head till the
[1:34:52] day of judgement all that that would has
[1:34:55] keep me secret until thy wrath think of
[1:34:58] all the all the heartaches then he
[1:35:01] skipped past God's put him over into
[1:35:04] place I believe a piece just the wait
[1:35:06] hang on even for the thousand years cuz
[1:35:09] they're not gonna come up until this
[1:35:10] they got the new birthright but people's
[1:35:12] been good to you you see them die you
[1:35:14] still wants the same no it's not no it's
[1:35:18] not God's hiding them until the wrath be
[1:35:23] passed that that wood has appointed me a
[1:35:27] set time and remember me if a man die
[1:35:31] shall he live again all the days of my
[1:35:34] appointed time will I wait till my
[1:35:37] change come he knew he couldn't meet God
[1:35:40] in the way he was if he died thou shalt
[1:35:45] call and I will answer thee thou won't
[1:35:52] have a desire to the work of thy hands
[1:35:54] for now thou numbers my steps just thou
[1:35:58] not watch over my sin what's this my
[1:36:01] transgression is sealed up in a bag and
[1:36:03] thou so it's up mine iniquity throw it
[1:36:09] in to see if forgetfulness let's put
[1:36:10] another scripture in there throw it to
[1:36:12] see if forgetfulness never to be
[1:36:13] remembered again you know where that bag
[1:36:15] went it went back to the old bags they
[1:36:17] give it to you cause the devil little
[1:36:21] dirtbag little devil bag job 19 we're
[1:36:27] not finished yet we'll read these then
[1:36:29] we'll be done why do you persecute me as
[1:36:31] God and are not satisfied with my flesh

[1:36:47] that my Redeemer liveth and that he
[1:36:50] shall stand at the latter day that's now

[1:37:36] reality cuz in my flesh I shall see God
[1:37:40] whom I shall see for myself and mine

[1:38:37] his soul draws near into the grave in
[1:38:40] his life - the destroyers in other words
[1:38:44] if somebody doesn't come we got a
[1:38:47] problem if there be a messenger
[1:38:53] a seventh angel messenger an interpreter
[1:39:00] one among a thousand to show unto him
[1:39:05] his uprightness then he is gracious unto
[1:39:09] him and saith deliver him from going
[1:39:12] down to the pit not deliver him from the
[1:39:15] pit deliver him from going down to the
[1:39:19] pit I have found a ransom and that word
[1:39:22] is translated a redeemer our Anna toner
[1:39:25] our the atonement if you look in your
[1:39:29] Scofield Bible in the middle of it it
[1:39:31] will tell you his flesh shall be fresher
[1:39:37] than a child he shall return to the days
[1:39:44] of his youth you believe that that's not
[1:39:50] a prophecy anymore that's come come a
[1:39:52] reality it couldn't happen in job's day
[1:39:55] but all these things there's a messenger
[1:39:58] come an interpreter to show unto man his
[1:40:01] uprightness brother Branham came to tell
[1:40:05] us who we are and what we're doing here
[1:40:09] and where we're going and then what
[1:40:13] delivered us the message he delivered to
[1:40:16] us it's keeping us from going down to
[1:40:19] the pit his flesh shall be fresher than
[1:40:23] a child he shall return to the days of
[1:40:27] his youth I don't just make you feel
[1:40:31] good now some of you that are young it
[1:40:33] probably doesn't but some of us that are
[1:40:34] getting older it's a hallelujah time
[1:40:37] everybody stand on your feet and you
[1:40:43] know what folks it's not a fairy tale
[1:40:45] this is a reality it will happen I don't
[1:40:49] care if I have to go by the grave you
[1:40:50] have to go by the grave somebody's gonna
[1:40:53] stand here and say that is me not
[1:40:58] somebody coming job was speaking of a
[1:41:01] group of people in the latter day
[1:41:06] there's no hope folks without Christ but
[1:41:11] there's really no hope without Christ
[1:41:14] bringing this message to show us who we
[1:41:18] are and then we live it out there's no
[1:41:24] way there's no way for us to get it
[1:41:27] without a messenger coming without
[1:41:28] brother Branham coming to bring the
[1:41:29] message but who did he introduce he
[1:41:32] didn't introduce William Branham he
[1:41:34] introduced Christ lady son of man these
[1:41:37] son of man is going to change our body a
[1:41:39] son of man cannot change our body but
[1:41:41] the son of man will change our body it
[1:41:45] will happen I promise you it'll happen I
[1:41:48] don't have to promise you I can tell you

[1:41:51] would amen so next Sunday we'll talk
[1:41:57] about the Son of Man and what he did but
[1:41:59] remember job's already told us about our
[1:42:01] body change job the oldest why did it
[1:42:05] have to be the oldest book of the Bible
[1:42:08] so that means that's the oldest book in
[1:42:10] the Bible the oldest written part of the
[1:42:12] Bible tells us we're gonna take about a
[1:42:14] change the oldest book
[1:42:16] he'll tell us cuz Jobe must have came
[1:42:19] way before all them other ones did
[1:42:21] remember that it is the oldest book of
[1:42:23] the Bible right why did he give us that
[1:42:26] promise in the oldest book of the Bible
[1:42:28] because it was fresh to job but job was
[1:42:32] talking of a latter time see they knew
[1:42:34] you look in the Bible how many times
[1:42:36] they talk about the end time the latter
[1:42:37] day and all the end and all the latter
[1:42:40] and all that's us that's us they spoke
[1:42:45] about this right here

[1:45:26] victory today
[1:45:28] is my name and were the only people that
[1:45:32] know what has been what's now and very
[1:45:41] shortly then gonna be a lot to come for
[1:45:44] us we're looking at a wall down here on
[1:45:47] these first three dimensions we got to
[1:45:51] step over sure there's way a lot of the
[1:45:53] things but the only Commission the box
[1:45:56] we have is a resurrection I read it the
[1:45:59] quote we are resurrection people the
[1:46:03] resurrection will happen in you and me
[1:46:06] and then a well come on a natural
[1:46:13] resurrection resurrection has already
[1:46:15] happened in a a natural resurrection
[1:46:17] will then have to transpire you know
[1:46:21] that pool that brother Ram is talking
[1:46:23] about I don't think we pulled hard
[1:46:26] enough yet because the message is going
[1:46:30] to pull them dead Saints hologram it
[1:46:33] will be a pull come among the people I
[1:46:35] believe and it is now where we're
[1:46:36] realizing that forget the laundry list
[1:46:39] that devil gives you crumble it up and
[1:46:43] throwing the trash
[1:46:44] we're resurrection people it's like King
[1:46:49] David King David was anointed to be king
[1:46:53] when he was a little boy he was anointed
[1:46:58] by Samuel the Prophet amen he was
[1:47:04] anointed by Samuel the Prophet as a
[1:47:06] young boy a young shepherd boy and then
[1:47:11] years later years later
[1:47:16] he meets a giant Mesa giant and it's not
[1:47:25] just that David and you know everybody's
[1:47:27] got the analogy of death and I know
[1:47:30] you've heard me before some of you than
[1:47:32] you have not I believe David was picking
[1:47:35] him five stones up and he said whatever
[1:47:41] that is standing in front of me I don't
[1:47:43] care if it's this big of Stone Mountain
[1:47:44] I don't care what it is cuz I believe
[1:47:49] now let's take it to heart I believe
[1:47:51] what my prophet said about me I believe
[1:48:00] years ago he said it now I've come to a
[1:48:05] little bit of a maturity to know who I
[1:48:07] am and what my purpose is and it's
[1:48:10] really not to kill that John everybody
[1:48:14] says oh yeah no it wasn't to kill the
[1:48:16] giant it was to be a king and nothing
[1:48:21] was gonna stand in his way
[1:48:22] didn't matter death hell whatever it was
[1:48:26] you know what but the whole purpose was
[1:48:28] he was standing there going my prophet
[1:48:31] said I was a king and I don't care what
[1:48:36] it is you can name put a name whatever
[1:48:39] you want put on it but your prophet I
[1:48:42] read you the will I read you the will
[1:48:48] and today the will says you are
[1:48:50] resurrection people that death cannot
[1:48:54] have you or hold you
[1:48:56] so whatever five Thrones you want to
[1:48:58] pick up and whatever giants you want to
[1:49:00] throw it at he believed that until he
[1:49:05] sat down on that throne he couldn't die
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:13] do we believe that because if we believe
[1:49:17] that we'll be just like David we'll go
[1:49:20] through all that maturity we'll come to
[1:49:22] place where they will be a giant
[1:49:23] standing there and David a look at him
[1:49:27] like it was nothing because he hadn't
[1:49:30] been King yet but if he believed what
[1:49:33] his prophet said if we believed the
[1:49:35] Bible in Revelations 5 that says we
[1:49:38] shall be what kings and priests and we
[1:49:41] shall rule and reign on this earth
[1:49:43] nothing can stop us nothing can stop it
[1:49:47] our prophet has already annoyed us
[1:49:50] that's our anointing for the day it'll
[1:49:57] strike home and I know it is but our
[1:50:00] Commission is to get the Dead Saints out
[1:50:02] of the ground come to maturity get two
[1:50:05] dead Saints out of the ground death be
[1:50:08] destroyed listening when the saints come
[1:50:09] out of the ground death is destroyed
[1:50:12] because that's what's holding them in
[1:50:14] the ground but when death is destroyed
[1:50:17] they got to come out of the ground it's
[1:50:19] got to happen then we can say Satan my
[1:50:23] prophets already told me he anointed me
[1:50:25] a long time ago with eleven hundred
[1:50:27] sermons and he told me who I was what I
[1:50:33] was gonna be and there's nothing gonna
[1:50:36] stop me from reaching that goal you love
[1:50:40] the Lord victory is mine victory is mine
[1:50:46] victory today
[1:50:50] [Applause]
[1:50:52] go say hi to get thee behind come
[1:50:57] victory today's lesson join mine as your
[1:51:01] dismiss your is mine
