we can move on in you we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen all right maybe an odd scripture to use on what we're talking about but the lord willing you'll see at the end what we're talking about first corinthians 15 23. you know it's coming down for the christ is risen to become the first fruits and then talks about adam and adam all die even so when christ can all be made alive but every man in his own order christ the first fruits afterward they that are christ at his coming then come at the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death for he has put all things under his feet amen but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be what all in all you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been trying to come down and lord willing if we can we'll try to have questions and answers this afternoon because maybe by the time we get through with a little comments and a few things i may create a lot of questions you know but that's what we want to do the prophet said questions makes a strong church all right now my way of saying that is i believe he was meaning that if we have the answers to the questions not just because you got questions the world's got questions everybody's got questions we've all got questions you know but i believe he's referring to the fact that you know answered questions it really makes a strong church and two then you find out what's on the people's mind you know you can see kind of what what you're thinking about by the questions or to see if they understand what you're talking about on the question all right but now i tried to speak a little bit there wednesday night and i pray that some of you that was not able to come i would ask you to listen to that message uh and study it over and over because uh i believe that anybody at all would be in any human sense that would be thinking about that we're at the end of all things you know that so all of things is at hand first peter 4 verse 7. and i believe that that we're down here at the end of it and we look around and we see the world and how it's doing now everything's falling apart and all and then we can see that we've studied the word of god we've looked forward to a time and we see that that it speaks of the end time and and the things of like matthew 24 you know earthquakes and diverse places all kind of things happening around the world and we should all believe that we are in the end time now when we talk about it being in the end time we've never made any dates and times and seasons but i think it's about time like the prophet said one day he said something about you know the end and they said well you're setting a date he said no no no i'm not doing that and you say that it could be the week or the month he said i didn't say the day i just said it could be the week or the month well see then that's what the bible says no man knows the day in the hour well that's true we'll get back to that in a minute see nobody does know even jesus didn't know when he was coming but now we've got to bring that over with the prophet's message that would even he would say back there to them that he didn't know about his second coming all right but then he says when he comes over into the book of revelations he's already experienced all of the things he's coming back to the church to show the church of his coming all right now i've tried to make some points i'll make this and then i'll pick it up later see i believe that the coming of the lord has been taking place ever since the day of the holy ghost fell and jesus fell on the day of pentecost but it's not in this um correct stage but see each age was looking for the coming of the lord and that we know that paul as brother brown says was trying to get the people out of their mind that jesus was coming right then we thought that it was telling that it'd be here next week you know or whatever but he said that wasn't right said it's got to be a falling way first all right so then in that we know that certain things have got to happen to bring about the finishing up of the coming of the lord but i believe every time a person is born again the lord comes to you amen to live in your soul by the new birth amen all right now that doesn't do away with his coming that just starts it right amen that just brings into being is all that we'll get to in a minute where the prophet said he comes three times all right one to redeem one time with his bride and the last time i mean one time to catch his bride away second part third part will be coming in the millennium with his bride all right but we're not concerned with the first part in the basis of trying to get it to happen again because it's already transpired all right there's no need to worry about the third stage of coming into the millennium because we got a long ways to go yet before that transpires all right now but we better be concerned with where we are now and what's taking place all right we look around at the world as i say in wednesday we look at the world and we see the things we see the signs the the things that happening that has been spoken of well why can't we do as the prophet said they done when peter said they're in the book of acts this is that all right now why can't we say that see brother branham said this is that and he said now if this is not that let me keep this until that comes but if you'll go on reading and listening you'll hear him say this is that because it was to him all right and then he could say the lord is here and believe it but my point has been for quite a while is what when are we going to believe that we're in the stages advents you remember the word the prophet used he said he comes with three advents stages or whatever when are we going to believe where we're at that's it amen we can look at the world we can see all the things and we can say this is that scripture's fulfilled the prophet spoke of a bride that would become the word in the end time all right now i'm content this is that amen if not when is it going to be you know i mean you know plain language if this ain't that if something ain't taking place when is it going to be well i just don't see it well i swear you're blind you accept our with 20 20 vision and study everything in the world and still be blind as a bad because we don't believe this is that all right now are you following me you look at the world and you see the great things that are happening well is not that what this bible said would take place right all right so this is that this is that that the bible spoke of we talk about the towers falling you know we talk about the sun and the the things we talk about the uh the word coming before the watergate which is familiar with our days and times you know and we say this is that earthquakes in diverse places we listened to a tape the other night in 54 where brother brown was talking about tidal waves well see now we had them back there and they've always been kind of in that word way but what i like about life i get tickled at all of us we want to always try to make everything look big and and you know i can't even pronounce that big old word you saw me tsunami kumamis or what are mummies it's a big old tidal wave okay but everybody wants that big old word and they want to sit down and talk and they want to say what is your input everybody wants to be big with their words why not just say what do you think what do you got to say about it in the end times it says there'll be tidal waves well you know they never was called that big old long word back there they had them but not like now that was 54 and said look at him said they don't know what's taking place i said here comes tidal waves you know nothing going on if they didn't have all this sophisticated equipment look how many people would be killed because a lot of times that big old long word you talking about the tidal way it it just starts out in the ocean because of an earthquake or something and it just comes into land and you don't know it's there until it gets there 500 mile an hour right that's the speed of it there's no way to outrun it but why can't we say this is that i mean at least the natural things at least the natural world it's coming to an end what this is that the bible spoke of amen all right we had a prophet's message right we believe that prophet's message we're not looking for another prophet to come we're not looking for all of these things that people are looking for and trying to figure out we believe it's already come we believe the lord has already descended from heaven with a what a shout out all right and we believe that the lord jesus brought around and said in the rapture does all three of these things shout to voiceover and the trumpet in his descending well then why are we looking up there to go somewhere we better be concerned with what's transpiring here but why can't we say this is that you see what i was getting that wednesday night see to me this is not just speaking of it but if the coming of the lord is in three stages one to redeem his bride one to catch away his bride and one with his bride in the millennium well why can't we say that this is that the coming of the lord to take his bride away or when are we going to say it well just remember you can go down in the basement you can close your eyes and you can sit down there the sun's going to come up in the morning it's going to come up it'll make no difference even if there's a big black cloud to cover it over that still don't mean it didn't come up it's coming up in the morning all right well maybe my faith will stop it or go ahead because there's no promise in the bible for you to do that all right but you see what i was trying to get at tying together all of the things see then what are we looking for what are you looking for malachi 4 said he'll send you elijah the prophet amen well you know what do anybody just listening i'm holding up quotes from the prophet i believe this is that amen you know i believe this is that amen they will spoke up all right but if not you better be looking for nothing to come you better be searching for some guy that got some kind of going on and we don't want to do that right all right luke 17 30 are we looking for another time of the son of man or can we say this is that right that's right now i wrote this yesterday so if you think i'm saying something about you or your thoughts or whatever you think on what you want to i don't change my thoughts because of you i change it because of what he tells me but not because of anybody see if we don't see that this is that that was spoken of in the word we better start looking for that to come right i believe the lord jesus christ died two thousand years ago on a cross to pay for my sins don't you well this is that i've experienced that all right if if i don't believe that then i'd be looking for a messiah to come i'd run over to the jews and join up with them right but you see this is that but if we believe this is that why should not we be excited about it but it's like i told you over and over no telling how many times martin luther preached on the judge shall live by faith maybe done documentaries on him maybe done taught classes on it but he was like moses with his mama telling him he was a deliverer and that was good but the prophet said five minutes in front of the burning bush was more than all the mom was talking see then why can't we believe where we're at i'm not looking for the shout to come are you we've been heard shout i'm not looking for him to die again he's already come and died for our sins and i'm not concerned about the millennium because according to my understanding we've got to have a rapture then we've got to have three and a half years of tribulation for the jews and then we've got to have a period of time in there and then we come riding back in the millennium so that's quite a ways on down there's no need of being worried about it but that's what everybody wants a man gave me a book years ago i'll get to it this evening on some other time but he gave me a book he wanted to know what 77 was and he gave me a i mean it was that thick and he said i want you to put the quotes and the notes and the things in there well i never put a one in there because he wasn't concerned with anything else all he was concerned about was what was going on there and like i say to you see most of you your mind thinks of you're not concerned with what's going on now i wonder what's going to be in the millennium well what are you doing it's not here and you know what your unbelief ain't going to change it let's wait till that gets here they'd be like trying to make jesus get up on the cross and die again because we didn't like what he done or the way done it but yeah what are we recognizing your day in this message we've had the prophet's message we believe that but where's the voice of the archangel supposed to be if jesus is descending with the voice of the archangel come on it's going to have to be here on earth then the trumpet sounds but remember the trumpet to curse away to meet him in the air there's got to be a resurrection before then you see what i've been trying to bring to us see that voice of the archangel is the lord jesus christ and where is that to be come on didn't we give it he said he's waiting on you and i adoption time when he can pour in his fullness that's what the holy ghost given for come visible among us raise the dead and we go in the rapture all right then it's got to be in you and i am if not we're still waiting on something that's right see to become visible among us all right now i got a lot of quotes and i'll be glad to give you the things but i'll just try to scan through because i've used these but this is what i decided to do to read a little bit or to scan through the quotes they'll be on the internet so that people can read them and uh you know out there so then they won't be lost but most of you have heard these things but then we'll go through some things that i want to lay down and then just make a few comments this afternoon we'll have questions and answers the lord willing you know upon the things and i have no problems with saying i don't know that's the one thing preachers don't like to admit they'll run around it and beat around it and scream about it and you know make you think they know what they're talking about but aaron roberts the first time that he called me up and asked me a question i said i don't know he said i thought brother dale was supposed to know everything well he doesn't and no problems but i'm ever learning i hope i'm just coming to the knowledge of the truth you know but not missing you but we've been through it quite a bit right there'll be three advents to the coming of the lord jesus the first time to redeem his bride when he died for her second to receive his bride when he comes for her third will be his bride with his bride for the millennium there'll be three advents this is 1954 the great revival and the outpouring of the holy spirit there will be three advents and one of them is past and the signpost and showing that we're near the second advent of the lord jesus first one's already pious and we're in the second advent well why are we worried about anything else well i'd like to know what's going on in the millennium i'm human being i like to look at things and see things but what good is that going to be if i'm not there you know because if we if we don't come into this one i told you this 40 years ago if this bride of christ cannot come to rapture in faith then there's no hopes of anybody in the world being raised in the dead i'll make that blunt i'll still make it blunt this is not just a time run out of this happening but this is that amen see comes three times questions and answers 54 one to redeem second time to receive his church third time to be caught away that was 54 questions and answers to 57 if they roll these fights enough all right but i ain't worried about it because it doesn't give you these and when jesus returns he comes with the bride jesus comes three times he come the first time to redeem his bride he come to set comes the second time to receive his church he comes the third time with his church so it's all one great perfect coming one great perfect coming but in three parts well see when are we going to believe it ten virgins 1960. his coming is in three the first time he came to redeem his bride second time he comes to catch away his bride like a love affair comes around and steals her out at night time takes her away from the world meet him in the air the secret coming of the lord see the second time he come is to receive the bride first to redeem second to receive third time with her king and queen but do we believe that well now we've got to be somewhere in one of those three stages would you admit that right well one's christ another one's after we leave the world three and a half years at least on packs where we're at so what should we be concerned with 61 jesus comes three times he come to redeem his bride he comes the second time to catch her away he comes a third time with her redeem his bride receive his bride bring him and his bride back his king and queen just think about it the reason i'm bringing it down is because i'm giving it if you follow it it's coming on down starting back there that he saw what he was talking about 54 and we're going all the way up to 64. this is the message paradox 64. he comes three times one time he comes to redeem his wife next time he comes to catch her away the next time he comes with her three comings all right the future home 1964. now there's pyramid teachings and the different things he said everything's in three jesus comes three times come once to redeem his bride next time to get his bride next time with his pride three comings one's pissed and one of them's wiped up into the future so we shouldn't be concerned with it now listen to what i'm saying because i've made this over and over especially for the internet people you'll say well brother dale don't know what he's talking about there's many i've explained it throughout the series there's many more parts of coming than just to be the things we've covered there's a coming to the jews there's a coming to end the world all kinds of things about his coming but we're not concerned with that so why would your prophet say that there's three comings when he knew there would be a coming to the jews after we leave right but he lists three comings because if this part second phase advent park pace whatever you want to call it if it's not made right and come to the correct position and said a moment ago then the jews don't have a change nobody has a change we just wait until this thing blows up you know or whatever but when are we going to recognize our time as i said about martin luther even though he protested the catholic church with the just shall live by faith they didn't get upset with him come on read your history it's when the people begin to believe what martin luther said then the catholic church got excited because they wasn't concerned about one man it's when the people right begin to become one with what he said and sure we know that even in the natural they went out and burned down buildings and things luther said i didn't say that i didn't tell you to do that i told you get out of it or really luther i've read his writings i got it home on some of it he didn't want to leave the catholic church he wanted his life called reform he wanted to reform the church he wanted to stay they drove him out why because the people started believing what he said sure in brother brown's day the world was against him yes but why did it go you know i know that there was a problem back there we were coming along in 68 you know 67 and some of you was back with him in his ministry but there wasn't a lot of protesting going on right with a lot of troubles going on everybody wanted him right until he began to preach the word just like the lord jesus right when he started preaching the word they got against him he said when you begin to say i and my father one and these other things he said all right but look see in the past we started with a lot of doctrines and ideas and twists and things to try to deceive the people but then that began to quieten down you know there wasn't a lot of doctrinal ideas coming along after say 80 something 90 at the most that was when you began to get all of those he started out way on back with the two souls and the two lords and the peruses and the you know all of the things but it kind of got a low i watched that i've told you about it before they were kind of lull in the doctrines all at once there were two or three little fling ups now they got the river jordan going to jesus wouldn't god until the river jordan you know and then he'd finally become god and god left him and he died a man and all kind of doctrines but yet there hadn't been a lot of flying around so what was the next stage it struck they began to show how wrong he was right even the two souls the two lords and everybody they claim the message was right they claimed the prophet was right sure there was a little little nitpickings down through there this part about the out there in arizona and the dates being wrong we knew about that in 68 and 70s but there wasn't a lot said about it but you see it kind of when it got through the doctrinal parts then all at once they started attacking the messenger why because if they could destroy the messenger it would destroy your confidence in the message amen right i know one brother that preached here one time as a matter of fact he preached one of his first sermons here and uh well he was really on fire really going you know what he read one day he read it brother branham said if you see one thing you remember the quote if i'm wrong on one thing i said deny it all then something to that degree paraphrasing it well then when that came up about the wrong dates he just told the message away so you destroy the confidence of the people as to the word of god where are they going you see that's why i've made my challenge on the internet to come and show me where he was wrong you say challenge well everyone everyone's bringing it up it ain't me i didn't start all the doctrines you remember about a year or two ago i put a series in of the doctrines i didn't believe in and why i didn't believe them two souls we went through that see brother random never taught that satan give you a soul because that would make him a creator and you done missed it if satan can create he perverts he doesn't create he can't create the bible says all souls are mine and i went through all the doctrines i figured man that i'd be so loaded on the internet until we'd have to set aside three secretaries to take care of the answer and the questions i got one comment and that was about the two lords and all it was then was you just don't understand what the brother talked i agree i didn't understand what he taught because and that's what i've done i didn't argue back i never even wrote them a comment because i told you i'm not going to comment on that internet but i did do one thing the next service i figured they'd be listening i said if you'll listen i'll explain why i sat down i said because the brother himself said that jesus and god was too separate's identity and i ain't saying no more if you're two separate identities you've gone back to the trinity but you see what i'm getting at the point see my point is the one thing once they went so far with their doctrinal issues the people got to get tired of all these new things and they wouldn't follow them like they did so they had to attack another way what oh he was wrong he's wrong here and he's wrong here he's wrong here he's wrong here first thing you do on the internet you want to go in my office sit down type in william bratton it'll come up the first thing it'll tell you all the wrongs see in our day we couldn't have nothing to be able to read the first book that we found of anything related to brother branham by the world was um god's generals that was the first one it appeared to say anything contrary or good or whatever you know i'm not talking about the 20th century prophet book i'm not about what the world wrote of him but you see what i'm talking about what created this problem the devil knows if he can stop you from believing what the prophet taught he's got you defeated that's what i see around the land because the devil don't have to have help he's got plenty of preachers he don't have to do nothing he's on vacation but you see church what i'm trying to get you to see is if we don't recognize who we are and start believing who we are as i said about luther don't tell him how many times he preached that but one day that joshua lived by faith jumped off that page in a man's heart and when he got the people to believe that oh the catholic church got upset well you're getting a few people around the world today that's getting fed up with all of this hubba law that's going around the so-called message people and they're beginning to say i don't believe that let me keep this if that is what you got if that's that let me keep this because i don't believe that i believe the message of the hour and i believe what he said all right like i said then we come up to where we were talking about what was the holy ghost given for read around said god's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in christ becomes so close together till christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture like we've got to recognize we got to recognize it correctly though don't you remember this one where he said in 55 in proof of the resurrection he said christ showed himself visible among the early risers and he never showed it anymore through this family of the day the evening time then he made himself known again for he was alpha and omega that didn't mean there wasn't nothing down to the ages he's talking about something visible something not necessarily tangible because that's where we get confused with something visible jesus had the sign of the son of man right we did not the prophet in the end time of the son of the son of man so he's come back in the end time visible he says among us arrows of god's deliverance shot from above 1956. so we're glad that we've got a living god we've got one who promised us he's right here with us showing himself visible among us right i believe in the prophet's message that god showed himself visible not physical visible there's a lot of difference invisible physical he was not the son of man he was a son of man that the son of man used to speak all right but yet how close could you get to it of what he was looking at that he would become visible not like it was down to the ages down through the ages remember what he said he said it's been that he died son of man rose son of god that has been sown on god down through seven church ages but said in the end time is to come back as son of man all right now through the prophet's message then we can understand and like i told you in 1969 in athens georgia the first sermon i preached was that the bride of jesus christ your prophet said would be the son of man now that's up to you to believe or whatever i want to believe i'm just saying what he said he said the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily now i'm not derogatory i'm stating it he didn't say the prophet would be the fullness of the godhead bodily you can't make that you make him jesus christ but you make the bride jesus christ made manifest and you know what brother branham was a part of the bride amen remember we're the only ages had a major prophet that was not only a prophet from birth not only a church messenger right one promised in the bible to come a word prophet but he had the baptism of the holy ghost that none of your prophets in the old testament had they had an anointing of the holy ghost but they were not in the body of christ this man was in the body of christ right come on he said we wonder what john wolf what about the scripture listen to brother brown and talk about it last night john received the baptism of the holy ghost while he's in his mother's womb but the bible says the least in the kingdom is greater than john well go ahead do what you want to but listen become visible think about the day that the prophet was here 1961 forgotten beatitudes there's been a dismal day it certainly has enough light to see how to join church using to make organizations and so forth but that real power and manifestation of the presence of god has not been seen for years and years and years we felt it listen and we know it was here and we've seen gifts working with it come on that get down in his ministry but when we see him come visible among us come watch with power in his church to reach up on the hem of the garment of that master and touch it bring back down his power here and speak to his people here and reveal making him god god with us what about it he comes over in 62 perseverance he said if he let the church go in just on theology and listen to him without showing himself visible among them like that then he's done something for them back there he didn't do for us he ever heard that statement to be made that he had to do it again in the end times see because if he didn't they would just be judged by theology right but no so what is it then what is the coming of the lord brother dale you talk about what did i give you it's rising in the sun he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of christ coming out of the church there will be a sheep waved again in the last days in the bride coming to christ coming out of the church now isn't that simple i mean brother branham what is the coming of the lord in the second stage that you're speaking of or advent which is not a physical because the corporal body of jesus christ does not come to the earth until the millennial reign so it's not a corporal in the basis of tangible he said that's why your blood on your hands and your forehead he said you're saying the physical body is here and he says you're out of the scripture because the physical body doesn't come brother adam didn't have oil and blood he stood there with a gift he said there's a man sitting right back here behind me said he didn't buy him a pair of shoes cause he said he's dying he said i say you're healed but now listen it's like i told you after brother random pies we were trying to think of the name we got around to some words and names but i still won't use it on tape but right after brother random past the story was told with some big name people got together and went and sat down in a meetings of a man that had a lot of signs and wonders and they were wondering about him you know why they were wondering about it because they thought signs and wonders was all of it they never saw the word the man brought amen satan could pass out supernatural gifts but he can't be the word that's why we don't look for another man to come to straighten out brother branham if you can straighten brother around him out then you've got to be almighty god stick your foot up i'll kiss your toe you say you shouldn't be that arrogant why not it would be true samuel dale or anybody straighten out brother branham you've got to be almighty god to do that a prophet stands before no man that's why he said you say what i say i'll be judged by it and up until those seals broke he preached a white horse rider as the holy ghost you know if those only tapes you've got to hold up you're not responsible brother branham's message is when god won't judge you for something you haven't heard but when we've heard he will judge it amen so what is it look what he said will happen in one in a million did you ever think what the people did he's talking about elijah you know elias must come and he he said he's already come you knew it not they went right on believing that mo that elias was coming right and he was right among them and they didn't know it so will it be in the coming of the son of man they'll do with him just the same thing the spirit of god is here well what are we doing what are we going to do with it are we going to eat manna and so forth and not continually move up as we grow this message was sent for you and i i told you 45 years ago i believe not the 63 doctrine of what they called it the uh coming of the son of man because i didn't agree with that he would make the man deity but i believe that the lord jesus christ come down and spoke to you and i to a prophet and brought a message that message is to the bride now the second coming of jesus christ i said that then why wouldn't i say it now and you know what to show you there's only three coming to the lord you notice this message is going to go to israel right so it'll be the second coming of the lord to israel all right damn it i'm not looking for his coming come on he's here amen but when are we gonna believe it right well i don't see it pity party you'll never see it with that attitude that's right as i started the message off at least you can say this is that at least we can say the world out here has come to the place that has fulfilled the bible but why can't we say this message is back now i've never been but one thing in plain blunt if you're looking for something else beside this message to bring you to perfection then you're hell-bound because there's no hopes of nobody else's message nobody else brought a message oral roberts billy graham none of them brought a message the schoolers the swaggers none of them had a message and brother branham said if you come with signs and wonders but keep the same old simple message he said you miss it now you know he's not talking about his message because his message was life there's no life outside of this message now i didn't say people couldn't be saved because that's up to god remember the message we talked about the appearing and the coming you can appear right over there today and save a person but that has nothing to do with his coming except coming in them and a newborn it has nothing to do with the end time message they don't know what it is what are you following me he's coming after a bride without spot wrinkle or blemish he said there'll be a little bitty group the secret coming of the lord jesus shall be taken away secret coming of the lord jesus amen the second stage of this coming is all we're concerned with right parts over there don't worry about it parks done ben amen we got it but you could give that right over there today the holy ghost could give somebody the new birth in a denominational church because i know most people don't believe that that's all right that's your business but i will quote the prophet he said a puppy dog with an egg under well that's the dad the egg so do what you want to now i will say this much if that new birth comes to a person right over there they ain't gonna steal their love so they gonna start talking about it jesus is real and they're going to let them know to walk across the street right we have told a few people here that came in looking for food they need to go across the street most of you don't know there's a street between here fourth street is missing but it's right between there so they cross the street listen folks when are we going to believe it the secret coming the prophet spoke of of the lord jesus persevere 64. excuse me presence of god unrecognized coming to the lord is going to be a secret coming he said it'd be too in the bed but people will say you're going on down reading that you know that brother branham made an outstanding statement one time and it's in here paraphrasing part of when he said people who go right on thinking they're being saved that's right thinking they're getting the holy ghost he said he's already come brother dan what are you looking for in this second advent phase stage whatever you want to use coming to catch us right away is the stage what are you looking for signs and wonders go on follow your signs and wonders the coming of the lord and what we're now we need to be concerned about is the revealing of his word or else you're looking for something else come on i'm not i've been blunt that's what i'm blunt and blind you're looking for something else to come if this is not a foundation for that if this message that we have is not a foundation for then don't worry about believing it because you won't be able to understand it we've got to be ready we've got to be ready so they're going to say i thought there was going to a church was going to go in the rapture you say you missed it it's done gone think about it evidently it must be a very much of a secret coming that we tried to preach the other night about a secret coming now a little background for this afternoon and then we'll quit secret coming christ mr god revealed brother around says that the coming of the lord is in mystery and he even states a phrase in another tape there about he said she won't even know well you know what he said jesus didn't know when he was coming but said after he got to the book of acts i mean the book of revelations he said in that his present time he knows and when he come to the book of revelation and started writing the book of revelation he knew when he was coming because he had went back to the father in the basis of connecting together that's why i read that god may be all in all that the son would be subject not done away with not terminated would be subject the prophet places that in the millennium that he'll come to that place to be all in all any places in the future home i'll be glad to show you the two different times that he places that scripture that god may be all in all he said the rapture is only for the royal seat of abraham the coming of the lord cannot be comprehended by the world is that true amen what was the secret that was left in the bible that no one even hardly knew anything about it until this end time whatsoever your scholars spoke a little of it it was the coming of the lord oh but brother you don't understand your scripture one day ever i'll see him that can't be in our time frame i don't care how much internet you've got and how much our ways you're running all this thing there's people in this world could never see the coming of jesus christ in that form so that must be a millennial scripture that ever eye shall see him but he can't be placed in a time element but you see that's where we take it but you don't understand ever i'll see him i've been taught that all my life ever i'll see him we'll all be standing looking up and it's a secret coming one in the bed jesus broke up right two in a bed one taking one lap i got a few of them in here where he says 500 people come up missing every day you see it still says fear not little flock now you know what i've said about it some people take that and try to cram it down you as to see there there's too many people following the message now there's not enough people following this i would love to see the world following this message it would make a good world but you know it's not going to happen because jesus said fear not little flock what brother brown say one day i doubt a dozen out of this interaction did he mean just a dozen or years well he said now that's what we want to make it we want to make what he says what we believe so what is the coming of the lord to you he'll split the eastern skies and he'll come down and there'll be a great shout then there'll be a voice of the resurrection some archangel standing down here and then a great big trumpet dude i think it's about time to get off grandma's doctrine you know what ain't going off on grandma because she believed the best you could you know nobody explained it to her we had a prophet to explain it but to shout is the voice i mean the the message the voice of the archangel is the same lord jesus he raised lazarus we'll be here but then we got his explanation that he'll not be here in a corporal 16 element body you realize how much you'd mess the scriptures up if you brought him back here in a corporal body you don't even think like that i know but you bring him back right now in a corporal body and standing on earth and his bride's here he's got two bodies now you're back to your two souls your two lords you're all kind of doctrines you don't realize that's what they were doing back there trying to destroy his coming how many of you would have liked to been standing with me the day i said in 69 and read what the prophet said because i still got them in the front of my bible that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man brother branham sleeps on a man he said he's not so well are you gonna make the bride something that he's not i'm gonna show you how you miss what somebody says you're gonna make brother around with something that come on you see yeah but you said while ago the bride you said it again would be the fullness of the godhead bodily i didn't say that brother branham did that's too dumb to say i'm still too dumb to say but i can say what he said well how are you going to make these son of man when brother branham wasn't the son of man brother branham was a part of the body of christ he missed the message while ago brother brown was a part of the body of christ so then the whole body of christ including brother branham to put him at the apex of all understanding he's in the body of christ and if he physically set foot on earth he'd have two bodies in and out we got to go up to meet the body right then when we come back in the millennium we'll be coming with him that god may be all in all that's why she's the fullness of the godhead bodily but you don't believe the prophet i'm like a man talking to him on a telephone one day and he said i don't know he made some statement i don't know i said hang on a minute i'll get my computer running i'll show you where it's at do you believe the prophet that's a dumb question ain't too awfully dumb i asked a simple question do you believe the prophet you believe what he said do you believe that he said the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily do you believe that he said she would be the son of man who's going to raise the dead well now we got it figured out okay but just remember you got it figured out but just remember you ain't listening to when i say it brother random was in the body of christ the voice of the resurrection comes from the body of christ not a physical lord jesus so i put it all back together see you lost it because you didn't listen to want to say it you got your own ideas your thoughts see some of you never heard these things so you don't know but it's time to listen what are we going to do it's like i told them in the fellowship meeting the other day i said if we don't hurry up and get out of here we're gonna have fellowship meetings in the nursing home you know when you get there you get the nursing home you say something and everybody in the building all right man cause they don't even know what you're talking about they don't lost all their mind trying to get that tiredness off of you know sadness where you listen to what i'm saying for a second i believe he's right on time but i believe that there's got to be a people who can accept what the prophet has said and believe it and wait for god to reveal it what did he say we need a revelation more than anything did he say the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the rapture so evidently she don't have it until at a certain place she receives it that's what he said about page 14 of the rapture message he said the rapture is a revelation he said the bride be waiting for the revelation do you believe that you're actually experiencing now this is the last question do you believe you're actually experiencing the coming of the lord you're actually experiencing the coming of the lord see then we're not looking for up there i remember one time brother brandon made the statement i know what he talks about we'll get to it this afternoon not into just a half hour silence and all that but we getting into some thoughts this afternoon to talk about remember one time he said he said you know why heaven's gonna be silent let me remember this quote he's cause ain't no ain't gonna be nothing up there now that's paraphrasing it but it's close enough if a space if there's time in heaven of a half an hour everybody wants to know how long that is on earth what does it matter what does it matter how long the point is what's taking place right but if we don't realize it's taking place as i said in the days of martin luther he wasn't worried about it as long as luther was protesting the catholic church bother them but when the people begin to say i and my father are one i believe luther's message they got excited because they started losing a lot of their converts well i think it's at least time to say this is that amen amen i'm not looking for the coming of the lord i stopped that many years ago and i've told you about it it's on tape i don't have to worry about it i'm not looking for the coming of the lord i'm looking at the coming of the lord because the stage i'm talking about is not a physical it happened 2000 years ago and it's not a physical to happen when we come back in the millennium it's a spiritual happening through the opening of the word that has been delivered unto you and i that's right see if you ever see that one time and get down to the point of really seeing that this message is the descendant of god this message now not the messenger this message is the descendant of god and when you begin to see that you won't worry about guru's almanac and playboy magazines and and love story magazines and you won't even be concerned what the newspaper says you'll be concerned with what did the prophet say what did he say see we can read what he says and then put our own interpretations upon what he says and what good is it done but you see we can stay here and have stated and people oh yeah we've seen the dead raised on six occasions saw a man his eyes roll back he told me yesterday that when we got him to the doctor got him to the hospital at athens nothing's reasonable that his blood pressure was 50 over 40. he said if you hadn't talked to me all of that way he said i wouldn't be here today but you see it's because i believe he was dead but when i called his name he just rolled back around and looked there was no hopes of an emergency out there or whatever our phones wouldn't work i said wade let's go he drove the tractor on the back of his truck i had a four-wheeler sitting on the back of a truck pulling it with a trailer running 80 miles an hour to get a mad talking to him hollering at him randall don't go to sleep got him at the emergency room and they wasn't even there waiting on it you've heard me tell about it i called him and told him to have a man outside to pick him up cause his man with a possible heart attack and we believed he done died the lady said what are you doing i said i'm doing 80 miles an hour we'll send an ambulance i said lady i'll be there for your admirals cranks she said slow down i said slow down bring them in and be outside ready i got there they wouldn't nobody outside i went in screaming and hollering i apologize to him later but i said i'm apologizing for screaming and hollering about a man that you were supposed to be out there to take in a i had to get a security guard and me and him had to carry the man in the emergency room they wouldn't even come out before they come out in a minute apologizing when they seen what was going on i believe the man died his eyes rolled back everything was gone but god touched him we have other testimonies right here of the dead being raised but yet people don't want to believe that oh that was just a well he was just in a coma okay okay i don't have no problem i ain't trying to convince you i'm just telling what happened why can't we believe in the resurrection well it's on it now i quote big man third pull was only for brother branham and the lord jesus i can quote the man's name that said that some of you know it i thought your prophet said the third pool was for the bride and the church he said and to the totally lost now i thought it was even to the church amen but are we looking at the coming i've been looking at it for 40 something years been preaching about it for 40 something years and i said then he's here but yet we're still looking for this to happen that to happen what has already happened well come on musicians what about it i titled the message because this is the series part is the coming of the lord part 5. and i titled it the coming the revealing of his word cause you tell me what the second coming of jesus christ is to be that's it come on i mean i'm i'm open i believe anything you name we'll put it in a reveal word i believe you said it anything you name is going to go to the revealing of the word so why not just start there come on church he said well this has got to happen this has got to happen it's not the word being revealed but what about it what are you looking for because as long as you keep looking for it you'll never say this is that as long as you keep looking for something you'll never admit it's here the very fact of you looking for it admits that you do not know what it is one of these days that means you're looking for it but you're looking out there this afternoon we're going to talk about the coming of the lord and i ask you to go home and look up the word c-o-m-e and see what it said i'm not going to ask for a raise of hands because 99 of you didn't do it and yet i ask you to do it right well i know what it means what does it mean when jesus said unless you believe that i am he that was his coming even the world admits he came but what are you looking for the bible says because some of you won't be here this evening i mean i'm making this statement the bible says the end of all things has come upon us have you ever looked up the word end e-m-d now how many of you remember the quotes where the prophet said the seventh seal is the end of all things amen have you ever looked up the word e-n-d well you see you don't believe it if you believe that you'd look up the word come to see what i was talking about you believe it between the services today you'd look up the word end to see what it is what do you mean i know what it means you know what it means by your intellectual concept you do not know what it means by your spiritual revelation you're still looking at things and even a human being should be able to take the prophet's message we've had an english-speaking preacher right he didn't preach in theology he preached english take the english to see what he's talking about but i'm a hateful arrogant dody old granddaddy because i'm just stubborn enough to tell you you're not getting it if you're getting it you wouldn't miss a service i already know it it's like i told a brother when he told me he's leaving one day i said would you do me a favor he said well sure would what i said would you stay and listen to what i'm gonna preach this afternoon i said because you don't know what i'm talking about you don't think i know it i said i know you don't know it come on anybody with one eye nice sense or no he wouldn't walk out the door going home if he knows what i was talking about was the truth but i'm i'm sick i'm pity i got in trouble trying to explain six here i thought was supposed to come to church with sick now i didn't say when you got a 210 degree temperature and you land in a hospital bed but that's what everybody wants me to explain if you got a disease and you need to be prayed for you come i'll put you down in a room downstairs and i'll go in that room and pray for you and then send you back home because we're not stupid we don't want it infecting the church but if you're so scared of these diseases that are around that's why you're going to get them you're going to get them because you're scared of it come on church wake up the lord is here why are we looking for him to come he said outside of the corporal body now that's what he said outside of the corporal body he's here just like he was oh you like hebrews 13 8 don't you jesus christ the same yesterday maybe today and then tomorrow church is time to wake up but you just don't you don't understand me i'll agree with you i don't understand you because my goal my desire for 40 something years is one thing to get you to see the jesus christ that i'm talking about that's why i've said it to the world and opened it and let them have it because i believe he's real the new birth i received was not just a thought or an idea or a concept it was a person of jesus christ and that person's never failed me yet understand go ahead brother 360. 36 inspirable 316 spiral book is i believe he's here but god in heaven will do pentecostal people believe better than that they believed god was here luther believed god was here wesley believed god was here paul believed god was here irenaeus martin columba all of those the only people in the bible that ever mounted anything with people that believe god is here at least another day we're running around talking about moses or there which one about to burn it about to you going in the mulberry tree he said he wasn't moving then he sat there and he waited said when that moving come in that mulberry tree he said come on boys let's go moses what'd he say i ain't going to egypt he said all right i am that i am he said we're going to egypt sister's been having a real bad cough believe it all right she believes it father in the name of jesus christ we condemn this coffin we believe your word that by your stripes jesus christ is the same yesterday go and believe and see anybody else what do you think about it what do you think about god being here what good is a god up in heaven oh he can send down some help he didn't do it he came himself he came down himself not sending somebody else but it's when we believe it what about it do you believe it you believe his coming is this message that is revealed to you if not what are you looking for you got to put it this evening women are all you can have the whole evening to explain what you're looking for because i'm not looking for nothing but the revealing of god's word and then a climax of that will be a manifestation there will be a change of these bodies but they're going to be here before we meet him in the air there's going to be a dead race right but it'll be done here there's going to be a gospel trumpet 10 virgins the prophet said a gospel or something israel was gathered at the feast of the trumpets i thought we were supposed to be gathered i thought we were in the time of being caught away but if you're still looking for something to happen then you can't see what's going on lord jesus you know what's in our heart it's been there a long time lord i know that i get hard and strong and but there's one thing about it they can't say that i'm playing around they can't say that i don't state what i believe because i've always tried to tell them about it i believe you're here with us as your prophet said outside of the corporal body you're right here with us to be visible he said among us to raise the dead and we go in the rapture and father we believe your word have your way as we go with a natural meal bring us back this afternoon in you lord and just forgive us when our ways are not right according to you the lord just have your way got us now and keep us in jesus name you're dismissed the lord me
