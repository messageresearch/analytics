[2:44] amen Philippians chapter 3 it says but
[2:49] what things were gain to me those I
[2:51] counted loss for Christ started at verse
[2:54] 7 verse a yay-yeah doubtless I count all
[2:58] things but loss for the excellency of
[3:00] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[3:03] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[3:06] things and do count them but dung that I
[3:10] may win Christ this is pretty strong
[3:14] words there that he uses amen
[3:17] and be found in him not having my mine
[3:20] own righteousness which is of the law
[3:22] but that which is through the faith of
[3:25] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[3:27] by faith amen that's it's the
[3:30] righteousness we want amen that I may
[3:34] know him in the power of his
[3:36] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[3:39] sufferings being made conformable unto
[3:42] his death if by any means I might attain
[3:45] unto the resurrection of the Dead not as
[3:49] though I had already attained either
[3:51] we're already perfect but look at this
[3:54] but I follow after if that I may
[3:57] apprehend that for which I also am
[4:00] apprehended of Christ Jesus amen
[4:02] brethren I count not myself to have
[4:05] apprehended but this one thing I do
[4:08] forgetting those things which are behind
[4:11] amen and reaching forth unto those
[4:15] things which are before amen there's
[4:18] great promises in store for the believer
[4:21] in this hour amen
[4:23] taking what God has already given us
[4:25] amen
[4:26] through a profit in this day through his
[4:29] word in the ages and and bringing it
[4:32] together with what God is daunted to do
[4:34] in this hour a man praise God
[4:36] not forgetting one thing not taking one
[4:38] thing over the other no taking both
[4:40] things amen and see what God wants to do
[4:43] in this hour amen
[4:45] the message for your day press toward
[4:49] the mark for the prize of the high
[4:51] calling of God in Christ Jesus let us
[4:54] therefore as many as many as be perfect
[4:56] be thus minded and they've been in if in
[5:00] anything
[5:00] ye ye be otherwise minded God shall
[5:03] reveal even this unto you nevertheless
[5:05] we're two we have already attained let
[5:08] us walk by the same rule let us mind the
[5:10] same thing a man praise God you you Lord
[5:13] I had a blessing to the reading of his
[5:15] word you may be seated this evening
[5:17] amen praise God appreciate the Lord and
[5:26] I appreciate the opportunity to be able
[5:30] to minister to his bride amen how many
[5:34] believe you're the Bride of Christ hey
[5:36] mate well if you don't confess is like
[5:38] brother Dale said this this past Sunday
[5:39] if you don't confess you're healing if
[5:41] God can only heal you as much as you
[5:43] believe that he's a healer same thing
[5:45] got to save you as much as you think
[5:46] he's a savior to you a man God doesn't
[5:49] pull us to do anything yes well I like
[5:51] what brother Branham said he's a
[5:52] gentleman amen it doesn't push you to do
[5:54] anything amen but the more you grab of
[5:57] him the more you're gonna obtain of him
[5:59] a man the more you have to you grab a
[6:02] man the more you get ahold of and if you
[6:04] come here with just a little cup that's
[6:06] how he's gonna feel but if you come here
[6:08] with a big old fifty gallon barrel he'll
[6:11] feel that the point is that he'll fill
[6:13] it it's just whatever vessel you come
[6:16] with amen praise the Lord amen so just
[6:20] real quick I would just want to ask you
[6:22] all before I before I get into the
[6:24] message that you all pray for us Lord
[6:26] willing next month we're going to be
[6:27] traveling to Honduras and Nicaragua
[6:29] so we've I've been invited the last two
[6:32] years by a brother there the brother
[6:34] that we help support here a couple of
[6:36] months ago to minister down in Hondo
[6:39] and I think I got the opportunity to go
[6:42] this this coming month so you pray for
[6:45] us my wife and I will be going and our
[6:49] girls will be staying with my sisters in
[6:51] South Carolina so it'd be
[6:54] it would be uh it'd be I think it'd be a
[6:57] blessing and I think it's a bit be a
[6:59] time so I want to be able to check on
[7:01] that on that work that the brother is
[7:02] doing and maybe bring back a report some
[7:06] pictures and also just get an
[7:07] opportunity to minister and some some
[7:09] churches down in those areas amen
[7:11] I love the people down there I'm telling
[7:14] you they're there they're about my age
[7:15] range and their some of them are pastors
[7:18] a lot of Ministers and they're just so
[7:21] on fire for God you know it's just when
[7:23] you get around them you know it's just
[7:25] it makes you feel this little to think
[7:28] we're so spoiled here in America and
[7:30] they're up there at twenty thirty years
[7:31] old
[7:32] twenty-five twenty thirty thirty-five
[7:34] years old up there preaching to Indian
[7:36] tribes up in the mountains ten hours
[7:38] away from civilization and they're
[7:41] dedicated they're dedicated amen it
[7:43] makes me feel like what am i doing for
[7:45] the Lord amen so I want to be able to
[7:47] support that amen so so you just pray
[7:50] for us a man we'll be leaving out on the
[7:52] 13th Lord will end of December and just
[7:54] be there for about eight days and right
[7:57] after that we'll be heading to Canada
[7:59] spend Christmas time there and then we
[8:01] want to be back for for watch night
[8:05] service Lord willin amen but we haven't
[8:07] we haven't been able to come to watch
[8:09] night service like in the last two years
[8:11] so this year we want to try to make it
[8:13] amen praise the Lord so tonight I want
[8:17] to speak about this low topic here and I
[8:23] want to title it turning the corner to
[8:24] possess our inheritance hey man I'm
[8:28] gonna believe God is moving in this hour
[8:30] how many believe that you need to move
[8:32] wherever God is moving amen and you know
[8:36] when you're driving and you're out on
[8:38] the road it's so easy to drive when
[8:42] everything is when you're in a straight
[8:43] straight road you know and there's no
[8:46] turns there's no corners there's no
[8:47] nothing but as soon as you get to an
[8:49] intersection if you're if you're not
[8:51] experienced that driving
[8:53] that's when it gets a little tough
[8:55] because these if there's a four-way stop
[8:57] you have to look both ways you have to
[8:59] and then you have to see where you're
[9:01] going to turn and in order for you to be
[9:03] able to make that turn you have to make
[9:05] sure everything is okay
[9:06] behind you around you to make sure that
[9:10] you can get to the destination where you
[9:11] need to get amen
[9:12] you need to know how to turn the corner
[9:14] God's always turning corners amen
[9:17] even in this day even after God gave us
[9:21] the message of the hour God is still
[9:25] turning corners after that and some
[9:27] people don't want to turn corners to
[9:29] this day they just want to stick with
[9:31] what God did in the 60s and the 50s and
[9:34] don't want to turn their corner but I'm
[9:36] gonna tell you you're gonna be left
[9:37] behind you better turn the corner or
[9:40] else you're gonna be left behind because
[9:42] God is moving he's not going to wait for
[9:45] you the children of Israel when they
[9:48] were when they were walking with with
[9:50] Israel with Moses under the under Moses
[9:53] they had to not put their stake on a on
[9:58] their tent and thinking uh you know
[10:01] we're just gonna leave it there forever
[10:03] no it was just a temporary thing because
[10:07] the pillar of fire was moving the cloud
[10:10] was moving everybody Moses was moving
[10:13] and you're just gonna be left behind
[10:15] amen
[10:16] so God is moving in this hour and and
[10:19] Saints you know I I'm just you know that
[10:23] I think Satan might been Satan but you
[10:26] know I've been really fighting about
[10:28] this preaching this message but it's
[10:30] just some things that God has has been
[10:32] working with me lately and you know we
[10:35] don't fight against flesh and blood in
[10:38] this hour I just want you to I want I
[10:41] want to make that clear we don't fight
[10:42] against flesh and blood in this hour but
[10:44] we fight against spirits and powers that
[10:47] are in the air that are anointing
[10:49] individuals amen to try to stop us amen
[10:53] from reaching our inheritance in this
[10:55] hour and it may be so ever religious and
[10:58] they may be coming under the name of
[11:00] this message but you better be careful
[11:05] you better be careful from this hour so
[11:07] I might say some strong things and I
[11:10] like brother Dale says you know he says
[11:12] he's blunt but I believe it's better to
[11:15] be blunt than to pity powder around
[11:17] around the edges you know better just to
[11:20] say how things are and then and and and
[11:22] if you if you don't if you don't like it
[11:25] then you pray for me amen
[11:27] praise God amen but I may say some
[11:30] things and I may I say them with utmost
[11:32] respect to the prophet of this hour to
[11:35] the ministry the fivefold ministering
[11:37] this hour brother Dale that's not what
[11:39] I'm trying to do I'm not coming against
[11:42] physical individuals they man I'm kind
[11:45] of making against spirits amen they're
[11:47] taking a hold ever so slightly in this
[11:50] hour amen and we better be careful
[11:52] Saints we better watch out by the word
[11:55] and what the prophet has told us what we
[11:58] need to be looking out in this hour
[12:00] because let me tell you Judas came out
[12:02] from the myth from the ministry that was
[12:05] it that day
[12:07] Judas walked with Jesus cast the devil's
[12:11] out healed the sick and done all these
[12:13] things under that power that Christ had
[12:16] given them back in Matthew chapter 10
[12:19] but look what happened it came out from
[12:22] amongst them to do what he did and you
[12:26] know the rest of the story amen so if
[12:30] there's gonna be any deception in this
[12:32] hour it's not gonna come from the from
[12:33] the Pentecostals it's not gonna come
[12:35] from the Presbyterian from the Baptist
[12:37] you and I know where we are standing at
[12:40] least we should I can't get deceived by
[12:43] a Baptist doctrine I hope you can't the
[12:47] otherwise you need to come here and
[12:48] repent get get the new birth because you
[12:51] need the new birth if you can get
[12:52] deceived by a Presbyterian out here you
[12:54] know you need to know where you're
[12:55] standing you need to know that you have
[12:57] the Holy Ghost in this hour you need to
[13:00] know that you're born again any men but
[13:02] if there's gonna be any deception in
[13:04] this hour is gonna come from amongst the
[13:06] same message in the name of this message
[13:09] praise God amen
[13:12] so you know God is always moving and of
[13:16] course the children of Israel
[13:18] they there's transitions that were
[13:20] taking place from one place to another
[13:22] and and we know that the law was only a
[13:24] shadow a man of things to come
[13:26] praise God Hebrews 10:4 1:4 and I gave
[13:30] the brothers back there these scriptures
[13:31] so if they can pull them up because I
[13:33] want you to see them was just when we
[13:35] were reading them a man I believe it has
[13:37] more effect when you're listening and
[13:39] when you're reading at the same time
[13:40] Amen praise God but look what the Bible
[13:43] says in Hebrews chapter 10 it says for
[13:44] the law having a shadow of good things
[13:48] to come and not the very image of the
[13:51] things can never with those sacrifices
[13:54] which they offered year by year
[13:56] continually make the comers thereunto
[13:58] perfect I want you to the scriptures and
[14:02] the quotes that were reading I want you
[14:03] to look at him in light of what's going
[14:06] on in this hour ready men because God is
[14:11] just as concerned in this of what's
[14:13] going on in this day as he was concerned
[14:15] in the 50s and the 60s but let me tell
[14:18] you God is moving God is turning corners
[14:21] and stews and some people are just like
[14:24] the children of Israel we're too
[14:26] comfortable where we are we can't move
[14:28] on we can't go obtain that inheritance
[14:30] that's just too difficult I'm just gonna
[14:32] sit at home and listen to the tapes and
[14:35] that's it no you're not gonna be able to
[14:38] get anywhere that way you're not gonna
[14:40] be able to get anywhere that way not in
[14:42] this hour
[14:43] not in this out because let me tell you
[14:45] saying it won't be fair to us to our our
[14:48] children that God is that that that that
[14:53] is being taught in this day because look
[14:56] we have children that we want to raise
[14:58] them up in the admonition of the Lord
[15:00] and I want to know what God is doing in
[15:02] this hour day amen it's great to tell
[15:06] them what God did back in the 40s 50s
[15:08] and 60s 70s 80s and 90s but I want to be
[15:12] able to tell them and to be able for
[15:14] them to experience what God is doing in
[15:16] this hard day amen and we're going to
[15:19] read that later on in Joshua chapter 4
[15:21] where they have to put a monument or
[15:24] they have to put a sign with the twelve
[15:26] stones after they cross the river Jordan
[15:28] amen to let
[15:30] no to show the future generations of
[15:33] what God had done in our day amen amen I
[15:36] don't want to get too far too ahead amen
[15:38] but God is concerned about not just this
[15:41] generation not just the generation that
[15:44] was before he's concerned about your
[15:46] generation and what he's doing now he's
[15:48] thinking about the future generations as
[15:51] well because let me tell you says this
[15:53] is about the third or fourth generation
[15:54] since this is the town since the brother
[15:57] Branham was here they're worried about
[16:00] around the third generation and some a
[16:04] lot of us came into the message at that
[16:06] time I came straight from the
[16:08] denomination into the message but my
[16:11] wife was born in the message a lot of
[16:14] the young people here today children
[16:16] today are born in this message and
[16:18] that's all they know some of them all
[16:22] they know is just a secondhand
[16:24] experience that's how they know we just
[16:27] come to the message church they never
[16:28] experienced a Baptist Church they've
[16:30] never experienced a Pentecostal church
[16:31] they don't know what all that is about
[16:34] I've been through that but the dale's
[16:36] been through the Baptist see you know
[16:37] some of us have believed your sister
[16:40] Gail you Presbyterians you know some of
[16:43] us have come through those things and we
[16:45] we're thankful what God has brought us
[16:47] through but let me tell you young people
[16:49] let me tell you those who were born in
[16:51] this message and this is how you know
[16:53] you need to get an experience for
[16:56] yourself pretty man you need to know God
[16:59] for yourself and what God is doing well
[17:02] in this hour amen and God what God wants
[17:05] you to fulfill but in order for you to
[17:08] do to to obtain that you need to be born
[17:11] again and you need to know that you're
[17:13] born again amen praise the Lord amen
[17:16] brother Branham says here in the message
[17:19] the church choose in law for grace
[17:22] he says you cannot break the types and
[17:26] shadows of God
[17:27] that's what Israel done in the natural
[17:29] that's what they've done in the
[17:31] spiritual and we realize that those
[17:33] things happen to Israel remember looking
[17:36] at things from from where we are in this
[17:38] day now they've happened to the church
[17:41] today just as they did
[17:43] then and we're about the end of the road
[17:45] now brethren do you believe that I know
[17:48] this thing's winding down Saints it's
[17:51] time that something happened I want to
[17:55] cross Jordan brother Branham says don't
[17:57] you
[17:58] Amen over into the Promised Land where
[18:01] we can see amen
[18:04] we've seen good things God has been good
[18:07] to us we're not complaining I'm out of
[18:10] here with you I'm out here on these
[18:12] things with you but brethren let's put
[18:14] ourselves together and go over we must
[18:17] go over we must go over we must turn
[18:21] that corner a man that God is turning
[18:23] praise God a man if you're looking to
[18:26] the word you'll see when the word is
[18:28] turning the corner amen you'll see what
[18:30] God is moving if you're looking but if
[18:32] you're looking to a man or if you're
[18:34] looking to just something that's outside
[18:36] of the word you're not going to see that
[18:38] word moving and that's what I'm afraid a
[18:40] lot of people as how they're doing in
[18:42] this ours just look into a man a man
[18:44] that is already dead and gone and his
[18:47] ministry has passed amen
[18:49] we've got to be looking to the word
[18:51] that's moving in this hour we don't
[18:53] we're not looking to the man we're
[18:55] looking to the to the message that the
[18:57] man brought that's what we're looking to
[18:59] that's what we need to look at but in
[19:02] this our Saints there's a lot of people
[19:06] that that have lifted up brother Branham
[19:08] to a pedestal in such a way that it's
[19:10] they're almost worshiping him now and be
[19:13] littering the fivefold ministry and not
[19:15] thinking anything about what God is
[19:17] doing through a fivefold ministry in
[19:19] this hour believe it and then on the
[19:21] other hand there's those they are up
[19:24] lifting the fivefold ministry in such a
[19:27] way where they're worshiping that man
[19:29] that pasture and belittling what God did
[19:32] through brother Branham and this our day
[19:34] but you let me tell you Joshua took both
[19:37] of those things and put a balance to it
[19:39] amen and you'll see that here in just a
[19:41] moment there's a balance to all things
[19:43] things God is the God of balance amen
[19:46] God is the God of balance and he always
[19:48] works in balance praise God amen that's
[19:52] the reason Saints why you need to know
[19:56] just as much as there's branagh mites
[19:58] they're also like I've heard here before
[20:01] there's loo lights there's also there
[20:04] could be Dale lights you know what
[20:08] Saints you need to know God for yourself
[20:12] amen
[20:13] you need to know God for yourself you
[20:16] need to have an experience with God I'm
[20:18] very comfortable because brother Dale's
[20:20] preaching the word and breath away these
[20:21] preaching the word and I know they're
[20:23] right are you man
[20:24] but you don't go home and study what
[20:25] they've said what if one day Amen god
[20:29] forbid god forbid that brother Dale says
[20:32] something that's out contrary outside of
[20:34] the word and you just say hey man
[20:37] because I know he can't never preach
[20:38] wrong gay men I know he can never go
[20:40] wrong because you don't go and study it
[20:43] for yourself then you're a daylight
[20:47] right amen praise God you need to know
[20:53] God for yourself brother Dale that's out
[20:57] of respect God with that's what we need
[21:00] to pray for our brothers are the
[21:02] faithful ministry that they continue to
[21:05] preach the Word of God amen
[21:06] cuz Satan is very sly in this our Saints
[21:09] he's very sly in this our now the shadow
[21:13] the shadow has to match the thing cast
[21:17] in the shadow closely right I wish there
[21:20] was something here you know if I was
[21:22] casting a shadow here wow this is not
[21:25] good but here's a shadow there all right
[21:28] you see the shadow here and you see
[21:34] that's not a good example but when you
[21:37] see the shadow when you see the shadow
[21:41] it's it's kind of showing what the image
[21:46] is but that's not the reality amen
[21:50] the reality is me standing right here
[21:52] amen that's the reality because now you
[21:56] know when I get closer the shadow and
[21:58] the and the reality meet then you could
[22:00] see everything much more clearer amen
[22:03] and so that's what the Old Testament and
[22:04] the law was was a shadow of what the new
[22:08] was coming amen when Jesus Christ
[22:10] stepped on the scene now you could see
[22:12] what those prophets were talking about
[22:14] amen in full in full color
[22:17] amen right they're standing with you you
[22:20] could even touch his his his his hand
[22:23] his his beard everything a man it was
[22:25] vivid it was very detailed amen
[22:27] praise God so Jehovah of the Old
[22:31] Testament is Jesus of the new amen amen
[22:34] and and so being that that that the law
[22:39] Amen is a shadow of things to come or
[22:43] their Old Testament thing is things to
[22:44] come I you know I look at the law as you
[22:49] know the message for our day amen you
[22:53] can take that however you want to amen
[22:55] but I know where I'm standing they men
[22:57] praise God brother Dale has taught here
[23:00] and saying the ministry has taught here
[23:02] he meant a lot of people are just stuck
[23:04] on what brother Branham preached during
[23:06] this time amen but they cannot get to
[23:09] this right here they can't cross over
[23:12] amen amen
[23:14] to get to it and they're just stuck on
[23:15] the do's and don'ts the long hair the
[23:18] long dresses that the clothes line
[23:20] religion but they cannot move on with
[23:22] what God is doing and this hour day amen
[23:25] so that to me is kind of like the law a
[23:29] man that's just a shadow amen
[23:31] I'm waiting for the reality for that of
[23:33] what brother Branham preached to come
[23:35] into manifestation in my life amen
[23:37] for that shadow a man to come in to
[23:40] fulfill this in my fulfillment in my
[23:43] body amen
[23:44] in your body I don't know do you want
[23:46] that or not I I certainly do amen praise
[23:49] God Butler Branham says here in the
[23:51] message turning northward amen
[23:53] now the law served its purpose amen
[23:56] it was alright in its day the law did
[24:00] alright in its day it served its purpose
[24:03] so has the denominations done all right
[24:05] amen it's all right in the in its
[24:08] purpose but remember the law never took
[24:10] them to the promised land Joshua took
[24:13] them over grace not long and neither
[24:16] will do the nomination any denomination
[24:19] ever take the Church of God over
[24:22] neither will any current denomination
[24:26] take any any of you over either I'm
[24:29] talking about denomination is amongst
[24:31] this message amen there will never take
[24:34] you over no tape ministry will take you
[24:38] over nothing like that will take you
[24:40] over amen
[24:41] you gotta be moving with what God is
[24:43] doing in this out right man
[24:44] because Saints a lot of people are
[24:48] incredible things that I'm hearing
[24:50] talking about putting brother Brennan
[24:52] back in the pulpit and things like that
[24:55] to me that sounds like spiritualism
[24:57] that's what the Catholic Church
[24:59] practices you will never have Bertha
[25:02] Brennan back in the pulpit physically
[25:04] amen I listen to brother Branham every
[25:07] day you can go to our house and why will
[25:09] I listen to brother Branham every day I
[25:11] always had brother Branham playing all
[25:12] the time but don't ever expect and come
[25:14] to me saying that we went over and we
[25:17] listened to brother Branham and I know
[25:19] brother Branham died back in 1965 amen
[25:22] praise God I want to know what God said
[25:26] amen to a fivefold ministry in this hour
[25:28] no I'm not I'm not I I wanna I want to
[25:31] hear him and what God is doing through
[25:33] the Holy Spirit amen through the people
[25:35] they meant not just through the fivefold
[25:36] ministry but even through you God speaks
[25:39] through you to sister Gail God could
[25:41] speak to you God could speak to you
[25:43] sister Charlotte brother Dan and you all
[25:45] are we're all ministers and priests in
[25:47] this hour Amen praise God not just not
[25:52] just through the five oh man we are
[25:53] ministering in some way or another amen
[25:57] maybe that might hurt some of you but
[25:59] I'm I'm sorry if it did and neither will
[26:04] the denomination Nina denomination never
[26:06] take the Church of God over it'll be the
[26:08] grace of God that shed abroad in our
[26:10] hearts by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:12] that'll take us to the promised land
[26:14] into the fullness of God's blessings
[26:16] certainly it is they make a fatal
[26:18] mistake when they do those things it
[26:20] served its purpose
[26:22] was very well but the time come when it
[26:25] wasn't no good no more God let it die
[26:29] out so he could take Grace and take them
[26:31] across now you think about what brother
[26:33] Branham is saying this is your prophet
[26:34] saying this
[26:35] God let his own word die out God let it
[26:42] die out so he could take Grace and take
[26:44] them across and positionally place them
[26:46] into their places and the promise thing
[26:48] so will the grace of God put every
[26:50] member every member prophets teachers so
[26:53] forth not a denomination can't do that
[26:57] and not any current denomination and art
[27:00] they can do that either amen
[27:03] so there was transitions in the Old
[27:05] Testament amen we see him also from one
[27:07] judge to another when they had the time
[27:09] of the judges amen
[27:11] God was using live ministry even in the
[27:16] time of judges it was a live judge there
[27:19] they were not playing what the previous
[27:21] judge was saying God was working through
[27:23] a live judge Jay men it was even though
[27:26] a woman judge now I don't want to go
[27:28] through you know get get get into that
[27:31] we know what the word says about that
[27:33] but God used a woman in that day amen so
[27:37] there was God is always working through
[27:39] live ministry amen praise God from one
[27:44] prophet to another but all under the
[27:46] same law of Moses and of course we know
[27:50] that there are transitions that are
[27:51] taking place under this message of the
[27:53] hour as well amen now we know we know
[27:57] that brother Branham he's a type of
[27:58] Moses that brought the word to us amen
[28:01] but it's very interesting that they pull
[28:03] up Malachi for chapter 4 look what look
[28:09] what verse 4 says remember ye the law of
[28:13] Moses my servant which I commanded unto
[28:16] him and horror for all Israel with the
[28:18] statutes and judgments and then verse 5
[28:20] says behold I will send you Elijah the
[28:22] Prophet before the coming of the Great
[28:24] and dreadful day of the Lord it almost
[28:26] seems like that that verse four doesn't
[28:28] fit in there but God has a purpose of
[28:31] letting us know a man that that prophet
[28:33] that Elijah amen that brother Branham
[28:36] types that was in our day he was also
[28:38] type in Moses as well amen so we're not
[28:42] forgetting what Moses said amen we're
[28:45] not forgetting I must say but we also
[28:46] want to hear what Elijah had to say as
[28:48] well
[28:48] amen praise God hey man so a man Moses
[28:55] ministry bringing the word to the people
[28:57] was a type of Elijah for our last days
[29:00] amen
[29:01] and just as Moses he brought the people
[29:04] out of Egypt and restored God's covenant
[29:07] to the people which was first given to
[29:09] Abraham and we've been we started a
[29:11] whole series downstairs for
[29:14] sunday-school about the circumcision of
[29:15] the heart amen brother Branham he also
[29:19] called us out of denominations and in
[29:22] the world and restored the Word of God
[29:23] back to us amen and just as Moses he had
[29:26] a cloudy day men brother Branham had a
[29:30] cloud as well amen Moses had signs in
[29:34] his life Amen that God gave him brother
[29:37] Branham had signs in his life that God
[29:38] gave them so you see the similarities
[29:40] are there amen
[29:41] brother Branham type Moses very very
[29:43] very perfectly but of course you know
[29:48] human nature does not like change we
[29:52] don't like change
[29:53] oh we just have so comfortable where I'm
[29:56] at Oh Moses I don't want to move on I
[29:59] like Kadish Barnea do we need to
[30:03] continue the 10 spies go over and see
[30:07] that the land was was was was good and
[30:10] it was flowing with milk and honey and
[30:13] that come they come back with a bunch of
[30:15] grapes and they're coming back and
[30:17] they're eating and and and juice is
[30:18] running out in their mouth and that lad
[30:22] is good and but the people were like are
[30:29] you sure are you sure yes good this was
[30:38] nice and juicy but I don't think we can
[30:41] take it though but you know there's only
[30:43] two there were willing to go who were
[30:47] confessing amen what they believed in
[30:49] what God had told them amen
[30:51] was Joshua and Caleb you say we're more
[30:54] than able to take that land they meant
[30:56] we're more than able to conquer it so
[30:59] the people and because the the ten spies
[31:01] they went in they
[31:02] back some good news but then they gave
[31:04] the people unbelief the people were like
[31:06] ok well I guess we can't take it I guess
[31:10] we can't take it just like in our day
[31:12] amen
[31:13] a bunch of unbelief amen taking place in
[31:16] this hour oh we can't move we we can't
[31:19] we can't accept what God is doing in
[31:21] this hard day amen we need to put birth
[31:23] ban back in the pulpit and we can't
[31:25] listen to the fivefold ministry we don't
[31:27] we don't that we don't oh well I guess
[31:29] we'll just die here you know go ahead
[31:31] and turn on my tape and drink my
[31:34] lemonade while I'm saying it you know in
[31:37] the comfort of my own home Amen when you
[31:39] need to be out you need to be a church a
[31:41] man listening to the word amen praise
[31:44] God amen so people under Moses Amen did
[31:51] not want to make that transition of
[31:53] change amen look what brother Branham
[31:55] says here in the message this great
[31:57] warrior Joshua here come Joshua back and
[31:59] Caleb and said the land is real here's
[32:02] the evidence praise be to God here's the
[32:04] evidence that God's promise is true we
[32:06] have the evidence here to prove it they
[32:08] said well the other said you can't do it
[32:10] you can't do it you get too much
[32:12] fanaticism mixed into it
[32:14] we just can't over you know and that was
[32:16] their opinion that's how it was what we
[32:20] have today is people's opinion why don't
[32:23] you go to church and then they just give
[32:25] you an opinion why don't you uh what do
[32:31] you think that you why don't you listen
[32:32] to the fivefold ministry and they just
[32:34] give you some opinion is there opinion
[32:36] not only they don't give you anything
[32:38] scriptural because they don't know the
[32:39] word they don't they just give you an
[32:42] opinion
[32:43] I don't want opinions I want the word
[32:45] amen and I'm I'm getting the word
[32:49] through the powerful ministry I'm not
[32:50] getting it through you amens so I'm
[32:53] gonna go back through the fivefold
[32:54] ministry amen praise God they said well
[32:58] the other said you can't do it you can't
[33:00] do you get too much fanaticism mixed
[33:02] into it we just can't go over if you do
[33:04] we're just going to break up all of our
[33:06] congregations we're going to do this my
[33:09] if that ain't the same old wine today
[33:11] that's right Oh it'll never work I tell
[33:13] you can't make it work
[33:15] oh we can't make it work but he who said
[33:18] it would work is able to make it work
[33:20] because it would it was going to be God
[33:23] through them amen if he can ever get
[33:26] people enough under his control get so
[33:28] submitted to him that he can do it I'll
[33:31] say that God will do it we we got the
[33:33] evidence today that Jesus Christ the Son
[33:35] of God raised from the dead and is the
[33:36] same yesterday today and forever and
[33:38] we're headed towards the Millennium
[33:40] hallelujah how I praise Him we're going
[33:43] to we're going in one of these days the
[33:44] captain of the host of the Lord is
[33:46] coming the Lord Jesus Christ will take
[33:48] us over amen praise God now it's the
[33:51] Lord Jesus Christ in you right now
[33:53] praise God through the Holy Spirit amen
[33:57] we know the Lord Jesus hey man he won't
[33:59] step foot here physically amen until
[34:03] later you know so there we see that
[34:06] these God is in transition mode all the
[34:09] time and we know also here there's where
[34:12] we've just been speaking about that
[34:14] there was also a transition from Moses
[34:16] to Joshua now Joshua he was the voice
[34:21] for our day I mean for that for that for
[34:22] that day amen for that day and no longer
[34:25] was it Moses Amen now look what brother
[34:32] Branham says here and the voice of the
[34:36] sign 1964 he says and what does and what
[34:40] does that do then I believe brother Bob
[34:43] sent this to me and it was really really
[34:46] good one amen so I give him give him the
[34:48] credit for finding this name what does
[34:50] that do then there has to be human flesh
[34:54] on earth to speak his voice amen there
[34:58] has to be human flesh to speak his voice
[35:01] I am the vine you are the branches
[35:04] that's Jesus speaking amen there is no
[35:07] way of getting around it friends it's
[35:09] just Scripture it's the truth and then
[35:13] he says you ministers believe that back
[35:15] there and of course the minister say
[35:17] Amen yeah man the true call Minister
[35:20] believes that a man praise God
[35:23] so Joshua
[35:26] he was the voice for that day the voice
[35:29] before that was Moses but Moses was
[35:33] already dead
[35:34] that voice couldn't continue anymore it
[35:37] was it that the law that he brought
[35:39] which wasn't even really Moses's word it
[35:42] was God's Word that Moses penned down a
[35:45] man on the tablets the ten the Ten
[35:48] Commandments and other other other laws
[35:50] that was all God's Word that they were
[35:53] carrying amen but now there was another
[35:56] voice that has stepped on the scene amen
[35:59] that was not forgetting what the law of
[36:02] Moses said but was not also forgetting
[36:06] or failing to hear what God else wanted
[36:09] to say as well in that day because let
[36:12] me tell you there were some things in
[36:13] the law of Moses or in the transition
[36:15] for them to cross in over the promise to
[36:18] the promised land they were not written
[36:20] anywhere in the law that God told them
[36:23] right there on the spot for them to do
[36:25] and the Joshua was not willing to hear
[36:27] the voice of God and the people were not
[36:28] willing to obey the fivefold ministry of
[36:31] that day they were not going to be able
[36:34] to cross over amen
[36:38] so Joshua he had to take what Moses said
[36:42] and what God was currently telling him
[36:44] to do and put a balance on both messages
[36:47] in order to help the people reach their
[36:51] inheritance this is all about balance
[36:54] tanks it's not one thing over the other
[36:57] I'll take the tapes over the fivefold
[36:59] minister or the fivefold ministry over
[37:00] the tape no I'll take both of them amen
[37:03] and I move on with God amen praise God I
[37:06] take both of them amen praise the Lord
[37:09] so the children of Israel had to possess
[37:13] the land and if not then everything that
[37:16] Moses had said was was was for naught
[37:19] Moses had already given them the land
[37:22] Moses had already told them you are
[37:23] going to possess the land everything all
[37:26] the miracles the crossing of the Red Sea
[37:28] everything that they went through amen
[37:31] back in the in the Exodus was for naught
[37:34] then when it came time when Joshua to
[37:36] lead if they were not going to take the
[37:38] land all that was was was for now
[37:40] so everything the message of of our day
[37:44] everything that God did amen was the
[37:47] cloud the pillar fire being photographed
[37:49] the miracle state that took place in the
[37:52] life of brother Branham and all these
[37:54] things they're all for now if if that
[37:56] message is not for us to apply so that
[37:59] we can take over possess our land they
[38:01] meant those things are for naught if we
[38:05] are not to possess our land in this hour
[38:07] day but brother Branham had said that we
[38:10] are to possess that land they men so
[38:14] somebody's got to go and do it
[38:17] amen otherwise all those things that we
[38:22] talked about so beautiful the history of
[38:24] what of what God did back then was for
[38:28] naught then it's so good to to like I
[38:32] spoke with a sunday-school class a
[38:33] couple of months ago spiritual nostalgia
[38:37] we just love to reminisce on what God
[38:40] did back in the 60s and 50s or what God
[38:44] did through brother Brandon but I don't
[38:46] know what God's doing around my life I
[38:48] don't mind I don't know what my children
[38:50] are seeing that God is doing in my life
[38:51] but but look what brother Branham did
[38:53] here and this and this you know you the
[38:55] way he carried his Bible and the way he
[38:57] wore this certain belt buckle and all
[38:59] these things and we're just so so
[39:01] officiated with the physical fleshly
[39:04] things of the message and we don't know
[39:06] what the message says I want to know
[39:11] what the message says Amen I want to
[39:14] possess my land I don't know about you I
[39:17] want to possess my land in this out
[39:23] that's my land amen
[39:28] praise God and like I said earlier Satan
[39:33] is attacking the bride and those in both
[39:35] both ways up over lifting brother
[39:38] branham downgrading the fivefold
[39:41] ministry or vice versa
[39:43] downgrading brother Branham and up
[39:47] lifting too much the fivefold ministry
[39:49] in so much now you see in the in sitting
[39:52] that's what Satan loves to do he loves
[39:55] to create imbalances but God is a God of
[39:58] balance in South Africa right now
[40:01] there's a church currently over there
[40:03] where they think the pastor their big
[40:05] old church there they think the pastor
[40:07] and I'm not gonna name names but they
[40:08] think the pastor is Elohim and they
[40:11] usually I have videos where they're
[40:13] singing to him Elohim and and all these
[40:16] things you know and and he loves the
[40:19] praise and he loves the worship on my
[40:20] and I'm sure brother Dale has seen
[40:23] things like that throughout his
[40:24] throughout his the years that he's been
[40:26] in the message so you see that's just
[40:28] that's why I say Satanists lie I'm again
[40:32] Saints yeah I cannot be fooled by the
[40:34] Pentecostal out here or the Baptist of
[40:37] the Presbyterian but you can certainly
[40:39] be fooled by a message believer
[40:41] so-called if you don't know where you're
[40:43] standing under the name of this message
[40:46] that you and I love that's what Satan is
[40:50] doing in the sound praise God
[40:57] amen
[40:58] read let's read Joshua chapter 1 amen
[41:01] now we still have time there's God we're
[41:06] not gonna read the whole chapter we just
[41:11] want to go verse by verse and I want you
[41:14] to see here what God is what God is
[41:16] saying verse 1 it says now after the
[41:21] death of Moses after the death of Moses
[41:25] now death is death right
[41:28] he's gone he's not he's not living
[41:31] anymore right after the death of Moses
[41:35] the servant of the Lord it came to pass
[41:37] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[41:39] of nun Moses
[41:41] sister saying amen
[41:45] so now God is speaking to Moses Minister
[41:48] amen praise the Lord
[41:51] but is that what the Bible says that's
[41:53] the voice now and it's not like like God
[41:56] Moses died and and God said Oh am i what
[41:59] am I gonna do I guess someone after you
[42:01] Joshua now you know no God was we knew
[42:05] the exact time that Joshua was gonna
[42:07] step up amen amen
[42:08] praise God but during the whole time
[42:10] Joshua was being prepared praise God
[42:13] amen now brother Branham he he said
[42:16] himself
[42:17] Moses represented the law but Joshua
[42:20] represented Grace and if you want to
[42:22] bring that up a paradox 1965 good time
[42:28] for the brothers to bring up this there
[42:30] you go it says now we find Joshua
[42:33] representing the grace representing
[42:35] grace or some propitiation that it could
[42:37] not exist in the same time that law was
[42:39] in existence right God doesn't give a
[42:43] message to two men on the same time Amen
[42:46] - amen praise God neither does any
[42:49] message that fords the people on ever
[42:51] coincide with a past message it will not
[42:55] do it that's where you have trouble
[42:58] today Jesus said does any person take a
[43:00] new piece of garment and put it into an
[43:02] old or put the new wine into old bottles
[43:05] they perish it bursts them open so the
[43:10] things that are being done in this hour
[43:11] in the name of this message amen
[43:13] they they're they're gonna perish
[43:16] they're not part of the original Word of
[43:18] God amen they're gonna burst and we're
[43:21] you know you just whatever it doesn't
[43:24] come from God whatever is not it
[43:26] originally from from him amen
[43:28] it will come to now just like all these
[43:30] doctrines that have been preached in the
[43:32] 60 70s and the 80s and all these things
[43:34] amen you're seeing that they're just
[43:36] kind of falling over away now where all
[43:38] these manna they're gone they're dead
[43:40] and gone most of them and so as these
[43:42] doctrines but Satan again is so sly amen
[43:47] he's raising those other things up in
[43:50] this hour they don't seem so so so bad
[43:53] like like like though
[43:54] things were back then amen but but if
[43:58] you're not careful a man you'd be
[44:00] derailed from what God is really doing
[44:01] in this hour
[44:02] neither there's any message that for
[44:05] does he are putting you on okay and
[44:07] Joshua could not at all be coming to his
[44:10] ministry until after Moses was gone so
[44:12] you see the very first verse here Moses
[44:15] my servant is dead now arise and take
[44:18] this people to the promised land Moses
[44:20] representing the law had served its time
[44:23] it's the law had served its time they
[44:27] started out really with grace to begin
[44:31] with before they had law they had grace
[44:32] while they were in Egypt without law no
[44:35] one down there was just the priest and
[44:37] so forth but they didn't let's just skip
[44:39] down to the last part here it says first
[44:41] it says so there was Joshua representing
[44:46] grace was right along with law but could
[44:51] not be enforced as long as law was in
[44:53] its proper place amen so the Holy Ghost
[44:57] amen in this hour through the fivefold
[44:59] ministry man could not do Amen what
[45:02] until after the message was brought
[45:05] forth in the way that it came amen
[45:07] brother Branham has already stepped off
[45:09] the scene amen God turned the corner
[45:11] amen
[45:12] but with the same message amen taking
[45:15] everything Amen that that message gave
[45:18] us amen now adding one thing to it I'm
[45:21] not taking one thing out of it amen but
[45:24] we want to see what God because remember
[45:26] brother Branham said what is the
[45:28] denomination is when you put a period on
[45:31] what go and you say I believe this and
[45:33] that's it and that's what a lot of
[45:36] people have done in this day I believe
[45:38] with the message that God sent period
[45:42] that the brother Branham preached period
[45:45] but they don't want to know anything
[45:47] else that Godhead is doing in this hour
[45:49] and God's doing lots of things in this
[45:51] hour and you should be spiritual enough
[45:53] to know oh because people use the
[45:56] message as a security blanket over them
[45:58] oh no I don't want to do anything else
[46:01] because I know this is right you know I
[46:03] don't want to get involved in anything
[46:05] else
[46:05] because I know the Prophet was right
[46:07] amen well then you're saying they meant
[46:10] that you don't know where you're
[46:11] standing in the word you don't you're
[46:14] not confident of the Holy Ghost that
[46:16] dwells in you amen
[46:18] to discern what's right and what's wrong
[46:20] out there amen but I believe the Holy
[46:24] Ghost God is more powerful than that hey
[46:27] man
[46:27] God has given us power amen to discern
[46:30] amen the right amen I can't be again I
[46:33] can't be deceived I've gone to a
[46:34] Catholic Church even in this message
[46:37] twice three times actually I think do
[46:41] you think I'd go in there and I'm gonna
[46:42] I'm afraid I'm gonna get deceived no I
[46:46] know where I'm standing
[46:47] praise God you should know where you're
[46:50] standing if you have the Holy Spirit
[46:51] dwelling in your life I know what the
[46:55] Prophet said and I know the best amen
[46:57] praise God but they use the message of
[47:00] kind of like a security blanket that
[47:02] they don't want to step out into
[47:03] anything else amen praise God BIRT verse
[47:11] two there in Joshua one Moses my servant
[47:14] is dead now therefore arise go over this

[47:58] somebody that was dead God was telling

[48:04] voice for that for my day amen

[48:10] verse 6 for unto these people shalt thou
[48:12] divide for an inheritance the land which
[48:14] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[48:16] amen and Joshua we know he's a type of
[48:18] the Holy Ghost
[48:19] brother branham said then i'll show you
[48:21] later on where he said it - he's a to
[48:24] divide the inheritance to the people
[48:26] which is a type of the Holy Ghost
[48:28] dividing himself amongst God's people
[48:29] they meant giving us our inheritance
[48:32] amen
[48:33] only be tough strong and very courageous
[48:35] that thou madest observed to do
[48:37] according to all the law which Moses my
[48:38] servant commanded thee now brother God
[48:41] was telling here to Joshua to do what
[48:44] the law of Moses amen he wasn't bringing
[48:47] Moses Amen himself - he was bringing the
[48:50] law that Moses Amen - remember the law
[48:53] amen we remember the message Amen we
[48:56] bring that with us
[48:57] and take whatever else God wants to have
[49:00] for us to have Amen praise God turn not
[49:05] from it to the right hand or to the left
[49:07] out that thou may is prosper
[49:09] whithersoever that was going they met
[49:12] and brother BAM says hearing the message
[49:15] abduction they men
[49:16] he says Moses being a top of Christ led
[49:20] the children up to the promised land
[49:21] then Moses did not take the children in
[49:24] the promised land Joshua took the people
[49:26] in and divided up the land Jesus paid
[49:29] the price led them up to the Holy Spirit
[49:30] God sent the Holy Spirit down and he
[49:33] positionally put the church in order
[49:35] each man filling him with his presence
[49:37] of his being
[49:38] amen praise God amen verse 8 of Joshua 1
[49:44] this book of the law shall not depart
[49:45] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[49:48] therein day and night that thou mayst
[49:50] observe to do according to all that is
[49:52] written therein we want to we want to do
[49:54] everything that brother Branham preached
[49:55] right for then thou shalt make thy way
[49:59] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[50:01] success God amen we would just you know
[50:05] God's saying that that that's my word
[50:06] amen and my word takes preeminence over
[50:09] anything else even over the life of
[50:12] Moses my word takes preeminence over the
[50:16] things that Moses had done Amen this
[50:18] thing wasn't about Moses was about me
[50:20] the whole time praise God
[50:22] is what God is saying amen let's get
[50:26] down to verse 11 pass through the hosts
[50:30] and command
[50:32] the people saying prepare you victuals
[50:34] for within three days II shall pass over
[50:36] this Jordan to go in to possess the land
[50:38] which the Lord your God giveth you to
[50:40] possess it what if the people said I
[50:42] don't want to go in three days I think
[50:45] that's too short of a time are you just
[50:49] gonna stay back we're moving the Holy
[50:52] Ghost is moving amen praise God now
[50:56] let's let's go to Joshua chapter three
[50:59] amen
[51:02] and Joshua arose early in the morning
[51:05] and they removed from shittim and came
[51:07] to Jordan he and all the children of
[51:08] Israel lodged there before they passed
[51:10] over and it came to pass after three
[51:12] days that the officers went through the
[51:13] host they meant after three days being
[51:16] the number of perfection amen and they
[51:18] commanded the people saying when you see
[51:20] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your
[51:22] God and the priests and the Levites
[51:24] bearing it then shall ye ye shall remove
[51:27] from your place and go after it now we
[51:30] know that the Ark of the Covenant
[51:31] represents the word amen represent
[51:34] because that's where the word was stored
[51:36] amen in the Ark of the Covenant and the
[51:39] priests that were holding the cup the
[51:41] ark amen which the ministers of that day
[51:44] buried the word they were handling the
[51:46] word amen the priests were live men they
[51:50] were in dead man otherwise they'd be
[51:52] zombies carrying the Ark of the Covenant
[51:55] they were alive man upholding the law of
[51:58] Moses which was the Word of God in that
[52:01] Ark amen
[52:02] so the people's main focus God that God
[52:06] is telling Joshua to to tell the people
[52:09] to do was to look to that word but the
[52:13] word needed to be lifted before the
[52:15] people right
[52:16] it wasn't gonna lift on its own hey man
[52:21] it needed to be lifted by the priests
[52:24] amen and they they had been the people
[52:26] were able to look at the word the law of
[52:30] Moses the message of the hour that God
[52:33] Amen had given the Moses amen the people
[52:36] were able to look at that
[52:37] praise God amen because it was lifted by
[52:40] the Ministry of that day
[52:43] think about that sense if the Ministry
[52:46] of our day does not lift the word up
[52:48] before you're not gonna be able to see
[52:49] praise God
[52:51] it takes ministers amen to lift the the
[52:54] the Word of God the message of the hour
[52:57] for this day amen you know in the
[53:00] Philippines and in other countries that
[53:02] I've visited you know there's a lot of
[53:03] people you can give him the message
[53:04] books you can give them the the tapes
[53:08] and all that but if they don't have
[53:09] anybody to explain it to them they're
[53:11] not gonna understand the message there
[53:14] no they don't understand they need
[53:16] ministry a live man a man live person
[53:20] they can sit down and tell them this is
[53:22] what brother Branham said was saying
[53:24] here this is this as long as it's
[53:26] according to the word amen and we know
[53:27] what brother Branham taught was thus
[53:29] saith the Word of God and Men and the
[53:31] Word of God is God himself
[53:34] amen amen so verse four yet there shall
[53:39] be a space between you and it about two
[53:41] thousand cubits by measure in other
[53:44] words there is a scarran be a space
[53:45] between the people and in the end the
[53:48] Ark of the Covenant come not near unto
[53:51] it that you may know the way by which
[53:53] you must go for ye have not passed this
[53:56] way heretofore Saints we have not passed
[53:59] this way that we're at before we don't
[54:02] know what the future holds we know what
[54:03] the word says about the future we know
[54:05] what brother Brown said about the future
[54:06] amen but we that's what we need to look
[54:10] to the word amen in this hour praise God
[54:13] so we have we we have to give the
[54:16] ministry space to do what they are
[54:17] called to do hey man
[54:19] praise God that space was there given
[54:22] Amen so that the people could see okay
[54:25] that's where the Word of God is going
[54:26] I'm gonna go it but if I if I get too
[54:29] close you know that then the ministry
[54:32] would probably stumble you know the
[54:33] minute the the priest would probably
[54:35] stumble something might take place God
[54:37] was telling this them this so that you
[54:39] can see clearly where that where that
[54:41] word is going
[54:42] amen therefore you need to leave that
[54:45] space amen
[54:46] praise God and look what Hebrews 13 we
[54:51] always quote Hebrews 13:8 right Christ
[54:55] Jesus Christ
[54:56] same yesterday today and forever but
[54:58] people don't ever read what Hebrews 13:7
[55:00] and verse nine say and look what it says
[55:06] remember them which have the rule over
[55:08] you who have spoken unto you the Word of
[55:12] God whose faith follow considering the
[55:15] end of their conversation
[55:17] now that word rule does not mean like
[55:19] they beat you upside the head and like
[55:22] like like a Hitler style type of
[55:24] ministry no no it's just those who have
[55:29] how can I say it those who have control
[55:33] or listening to the God to God in that
[55:35] day there's a certain word I'm looking
[55:37] for and I can't think of it amen a
[55:39] leadership yes the leadership that's a
[55:41] good wasn't the exact word but that
[55:42] that's exactly a man who have spoken
[55:45] unto you the Word of God whose faith
[55:47] follow considering the end of their
[55:48] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[55:51] yesterday and today and forever be not
[55:53] carried about with divers and strange
[55:55] doctrines
[55:57] yeah and they certainly are out there
[55:59] today for it is a good thing that the
[56:02] heart be established with grace
[56:04] remember Joshua type grace amen
[56:06] right not with meats not with the
[56:09] physical things of the message amen
[56:11] which have not profited them that have
[56:13] been occupied therein a man I was
[56:17] telling I was telling brother Dale this
[56:18] this past Sunday when I first come into
[56:20] the message in the church that I did ask
[56:22] that I kind of went to a few years how
[56:27] they preached was close line messages
[56:30] close line message constantly and I
[56:32] didn't I don't I didn't remember seeing
[56:34] one sister who was not dressed right you
[56:37] know they were all dressed seemed like
[56:39] they were dressed right you know look
[56:41] but they seem like that's all the pastor
[56:43] preached was clotheslined religion you
[56:45] know and and and and and and now the the
[56:49] pastor's wife is out wearing pants now
[56:51] and all kinds of stuff you know because
[56:54] why they're so stuck to the physical
[56:56] things and Paul here saying which for it
[57:00] is good thing that the heart be
[57:01] established with grace not with meats
[57:03] physical things you know which have not
[57:07] profited them that have been occupied
[57:08] therein
[57:09] we want to hear the word Amen well those
[57:12] things are good we need to hear when oh
[57:15] if there's a sister or a brother who
[57:17] we're not dressing properly and
[57:18] sometimes the Holy Spirit needs to needs
[57:20] to say something about that amen
[57:23] through the ministry amen but if but
[57:25] there's other things in the word I want
[57:27] to hear amen and that's not all that the
[57:30] message is about cutting hair and all
[57:32] these things a man there's a lot more
[57:34] than that that I want to hear amen
[57:36] because I want to possess my land amen
[57:38] praise God brother Brown says here and
[57:42] the message called the guide God told
[57:44] him that he would send them a God he
[57:46] would lead them in the way as long as
[57:48] they followed that pillar of fire they
[57:49] was all right he led them up to the
[57:51] promised land gate and then that was as
[57:53] far as he was to go then Joshua that
[57:56] great warrior remember the day that he
[57:58] told him sanctify yourself the third day
[58:00] God's going to open up Jordan down here
[58:02] and we're going to cross now watch what
[58:04] he said I like this in the scripture he
[58:06] said stay close behind the ark for you
[58:08] have not passed this way before what was
[58:10] the Ark the word don't travel your
[58:13] denominational routes now stay right
[58:15] behind the word because you haven't been
[58:17] passed this way before and brother if
[58:19] there was ever a time that the Christian
[58:21] Church ought to examine itself is right
[58:23] now we're right now where this great
[58:25] meeting is going on in Rome right now
[58:27] differences are being made to come for a
[58:28] duration of churches where all these
[58:30] denominations and Confederated together
[58:32] to form the image of the Beast amen you
[58:37] know brother brown said this message
[58:38] can't be denominated amen but there's
[58:41] people that have certainly done that but
[58:44] the word can't be denominator they
[58:45] matter but there's their denominations a
[58:48] surfer certainly in this message they're
[58:50] headed straight to that system a manner
[58:52] they're not careful and here we are
[58:54] right everything right at the door and
[58:56] people still following after a Creed you
[58:59] better stay behind the word their word
[59:01] will lead you across because the word is
[59:03] Christ and Christ is God and God is the
[59:06] Holy Ghost stay behind the word oh yes
[59:08] sir stay with that guide stay right
[59:10] behind it don't get in front of it you
[59:12] stay behind it
[59:13] I believe I'm just gonna get in front of
[59:16] it you know I'm gonna do my own thing
[59:17] well you'reyou're you're not in God's
[59:19] program then amen
[59:21] let it lead you you don't lead it amen
[59:24] you let it go Joshua said now you've
[59:26] never passed this way before you know
[59:28] nothing about the road Amen verse five
[59:30] in Joshua chapter 3 here and Joshua said
[59:32] unto the people sanctify yourselves for
[59:34] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among
[59:36] you a man so we need to clean up have
[59:38] our lives cleaned up and made to see God
[59:40] working in our day amen and in our life
[59:42] and Joshua spake unto the priest saying
[59:44] take up the Ark of the Covenant Passover
[59:46] before the people and they took up the
[59:48] Ark of the Covenant and went before the
[59:50] people they men which we know Joshua is
[59:52] a type of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ
[59:54] amen
[59:55] it was not the one holding up the word
[59:57] Joshua was not the one holding up the
[59:59] word right Joshua was not the way it was
[1:00:02] the priests that were holding the word
[1:00:04] amen I remember Joshua is the type of
[1:00:07] the Holy Spirit why was he not their
[1:00:09] whole you know why was he as the leader
[1:00:11] the voice of that day he was not the one
[1:00:13] holding the word before the people it
[1:00:15] was the priest holding the word before
[1:00:17] the people amen again think about that
[1:00:21] for our day amen and the Lord said unto
[1:00:26] Joshua this day will I begin to magnify
[1:00:28] thee in the sight of all Israel that
[1:00:30] they may know that as I was with Moses
[1:00:32] saw I will be with thee so as God
[1:00:35] magnified Moses amen
[1:00:37] so was God going to magnify Joshua
[1:00:39] before the people Joshua did not magnify
[1:00:42] himself amen brother Branham did not
[1:00:45] come here and to magnify himself God
[1:00:47] magnified brother Branham amen to the
[1:00:49] people they met a true God called
[1:00:52] Ministry of our ministry men doesn't
[1:00:54] magnify himself amen
[1:00:56] he may magnifies the God in him amen
[1:00:58] praise God praise the Lord amen uh-uh
[1:01:03] all right let's just skip down you can
[1:01:04] condition for the sake of time praise
[1:01:06] God I knew this was gonna happen now
[1:01:12] [Laughter]

[1:01:21] brother Terrence your line just give me
[1:01:33] a few more minutes we might might go
[1:01:35] over but just give me a few minutes now
[1:01:38] Saints this is life Saints amen to me
[1:01:42] this is life and this is the battles
[1:01:46] that we have for our day you see the
[1:01:49] battles that they were fought through
[1:01:51] the Exodus through the times when Moses
[1:01:53] was alive doubles the battles for that
[1:01:55] timer which led to the battles that
[1:01:58] Joshua is is battling with the people
[1:02:01] for that time we have current battles
[1:02:04] right now that we must face and we can't
[1:02:06] just
[1:02:07] we can't just pity patter around there's
[1:02:09] oh just let them do whatever they want
[1:02:11] to do and just you know I'm I'm sorry
[1:02:14] I'm gonna speak against it that's what
[1:02:17] God tells me to do that's what I'm gonna
[1:02:18] do
[1:02:19] again not not not to the people but amen
[1:02:22] but against that spirit that's trying to
[1:02:23] come and and deceive you in this hour if
[1:02:26] you're not careful now in Joshua chapter
[1:02:33] four I want you to just look at this out
[1:02:35] you can read the whole chapter yourself
[1:02:37] but one thing that I want to take know
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] Joshua chapter 4 they this was the
[1:02:41] during the time when they were crossing
[1:02:42] and after they had crossed the priests
[1:02:46] still in the water or not in the water
[1:02:50] because the Bible says that they crossed
[1:02:51] through dry ground they didn't cross
[1:02:54] through muddy ground it was dry right it
[1:02:58] was dry when they started completely dry
[1:03:01] and they cross right through that now
[1:03:04] thing now when they got to the other
[1:03:07] side before that God had told Joshua to
[1:03:10] pick out of the 12 tribes 12 men Amen
[1:03:13] and and it's interesting that you see
[1:03:16] that in chapter 3 and you don't know the
[1:03:18] purpose why that is now again that was
[1:03:22] not in the law of Moses for them to do
[1:03:23] that
[1:03:25] but God wanted that to be done in that
[1:03:27] time you see you don't saying that
[1:03:29] wasn't in the law of Moses 12 man to be
[1:03:33] picked out for but it was after they had
[1:03:36] crossed over to the other side that the
[1:03:38] purpose for those 12 men was to be it
[1:03:40] came came to life and it was for them to
[1:03:43] grab each one 12 stone each one a stone
[1:03:47] to take it from the bank or from that
[1:03:49] from the area and take it and to put it
[1:03:52] right there on the bank and to pile it
[1:03:54] on top of one another and God tells them
[1:03:57] the reason why I want you to do this is
[1:03:58] in order set so that the future
[1:04:01] generations that are coming after you
[1:04:03] you could tell your children that God
[1:04:06] had done the exact same thing that God
[1:04:09] did through Moses God did the same thing
[1:04:12] in our day amen
[1:04:14] because we stayed with the message for
[1:04:15] our our amen and you can see that if
[1:04:19] children if you stay with the message
[1:04:21] for your day God will be able to do the
[1:04:23] same things in your life amen
[1:04:25] praise God right so that's just that's
[1:04:28] the reason why God was was given that
[1:04:30] giving them that that that sign to put
[1:04:32] those 12 stones on top of one another to
[1:04:34] let them know to let the children know
[1:04:37] hey son let me tell you let me tell you
[1:04:40] what God did when they come in asks
[1:04:42] daddy why are those stones there son let
[1:04:46] me tell you what God did in my day you
[1:04:48] know let me tell you what God did in my
[1:04:50] day hey man
[1:04:51] and that's what a lot of people don't
[1:04:53] have that testimony for their children
[1:04:55] in this house or they could tell you
[1:04:56] what God did for brother Branham but
[1:04:58] it's okay to talk about what God did for
[1:05:01] Moses but the children the children want
[1:05:06] to know what God is doing in your life
[1:05:07] amen
[1:05:08] what did God do in your life because
[1:05:11] that will affect them and tell them oh
[1:05:14] my if I stay with this word if I do what
[1:05:17] mommy and daddy did then God will be
[1:05:19] able to work in my life in that way
[1:05:21] praise God so that's what I got out I
[1:05:25] got out of that amen praise God amen
[1:05:28] just kind of throw that in a many and if
[1:05:33] the children heed to that and are taught
[1:05:35] well and live it in the word for their
[1:05:37] day then
[1:05:38] God will perform the same miracles and
[1:05:39] signs in their lives and in their
[1:05:42] children's lives and so on and so on
[1:05:44] amen praise God that was something for
[1:05:48] us parents amen
[1:05:50] praise God now Joshua chapter five we're
[1:05:55] winding down here this is the meat and
[1:05:59] potatoes now praise God the others was
[1:06:02] kind of appetizers now let's get to
[1:06:05] Joshua chapter five now now we know that
[1:06:08] the land of Canaan a man represents the
[1:06:11] Christian life in the Holy Ghost does
[1:06:13] not represent the the millennium and it
[1:06:17] does not represent heaven you know like
[1:06:20] some denominations may say or some
[1:06:22] people may say it's life and the Holy
[1:06:24] Ghost why because they still had
[1:06:27] troubles and problems stripes sicknesses
[1:06:30] and things that were taking place in
[1:06:32] that time after they had even crossed
[1:06:35] over amen
[1:06:36] now Joshua chapter five verse one and it
[1:06:39] came to pass when all the kings of the
[1:06:41] amorite which were on the side of Jordan
[1:06:42] westward this is after the children of
[1:06:45] Israel had crossed over and all the
[1:06:47] kings of the Canaanites which were by
[1:06:48] the sea heard that the Lord had dried up
[1:06:51] the waters of Jordan again he dried up
[1:06:54] those waters and they were overflowing
[1:06:55] during that time what a miracle working
[1:06:58] God ain't name those banks a man there
[1:07:01] were overflowing waters and be from
[1:07:03] before the children of it until we were
[1:07:05] passed over that their heart melted the
[1:07:07] people around them were scared neither
[1:07:10] was their spirit in them anymore because
[1:07:11] of the children of Israel they knew that
[1:07:14] God was with them amen I wondered the
[1:07:16] world's can say the same thing about you
[1:07:18] and me hmm
[1:07:20] at that time verse two at that time the
[1:07:24] Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp
[1:07:27] knives and circumcise again the children
[1:07:30] of Israel the second time oh we crossed
[1:07:36] over the Jordan where we made it
[1:07:39] glory be to God but God then comes down
[1:07:41] with a message to Joshua which was not
[1:07:44] in the it wasn't a message that wasn't
[1:07:46] in the law it was a message specifically
[1:07:49] for Joshua to tell the children of
[1:07:50] Israel right there in
[1:07:51] in and say no praise God I brought you
[1:07:55] through pray you die praise the Lord
[1:07:57] you're you're here but there's something
[1:07:59] else you must do amen there's something
[1:08:02] else you must do amen
[1:08:05] circumcise again the children of Israel
[1:08:07] the second time now as I was mentioning
[1:08:10] on Sunday School God gave Abraham the
[1:08:14] sign of circumcision in order to show to
[1:08:17] show that he was going to keep that
[1:08:19] covenant with Abraham that message
[1:08:22] that's that law or that that covenant
[1:08:25] moved on to Moses and God gave it to
[1:08:28] Moses as well in the the man for that
[1:08:31] hour and he was to keep that give it to
[1:08:33] the children of Israel he was to keep
[1:08:35] that as well and now here the next man
[1:08:38] in line the next messenger for this age
[1:08:40] he's asked to do the same thing again
[1:08:44] and we're gonna continue reading as to
[1:08:47] why amen the second time Amen Saints
[1:08:50] because let me tell you let me just read
[1:08:52] here what brother Brown says here in the
[1:08:55] message the results of decision notice
[1:08:57] now how they went on god looked down
[1:09:00] both smoldering sacrifices and God
[1:09:02] blessed Israel because he was with
[1:09:03] Israel
[1:09:04] here they come up now to the border line
[1:09:06] Moses had died and Joshua was the new
[1:09:08] leader and he was going to take the
[1:09:10] children across to the other side they
[1:09:12] sent some more spies out had to go spy
[1:09:14] the land out again forty years had
[1:09:16] passed that see you have to go you have
[1:09:19] to go do your first works over again
[1:09:22] amen don't you praise God
[1:09:26] amen and brotherwe brought this out to
[1:09:29] me and Sunday and I thought was really
[1:09:31] good the the brothers can can bring up
[1:09:33] that the stature of a perfect man kind
[1:09:36] of a bigger the bigger because I mean
[1:09:42] and while they're bringing that let me
[1:09:44] just continue reading this this thing
[1:09:46] that is cool I think if Pentecost
[1:09:48] started off back there with that kind of
[1:09:50] a freeing going of free hearted and the
[1:09:52] free in the spirit and everything I
[1:09:54] think you better go and do your first
[1:09:55] works over again don't you think so
[1:09:57] get back to the old hewing line the old
[1:10:00] landmark again come back again to
[1:10:01] believing in God come back to letting
[1:10:04] the Holy Ghost have its way
[1:10:05] in your heart to worshipping God in the
[1:10:07] spirit in doing like they used to a man
[1:10:09] praise God now to me and and in brother
[1:10:15] Joe he's mentioned this before you can
[1:10:17] kind of look at this almost kind of like
[1:10:19] a like a like a road you know you see
[1:10:23] what I'm saying if you lay it flat you
[1:10:25] know it kind of looks like a road you
[1:10:27] know but and just in type you know the
[1:10:33] children of Israel at Jordan Amen praise
[1:10:35] God
[1:10:36] now you receive the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:10:38] when you're born again at faith right
[1:10:40] praise God amen and it's the Holy Ghost
[1:10:43] the Holy Spirit in you that produces
[1:10:45] these virtues they meant you keep
[1:10:47] producing yourself contrary to or a lot
[1:10:49] of people think you can't produce
[1:10:51] knowledge virtue of temperance basis all
[1:10:53] these things on your own that's not in
[1:10:55] you to do that you man
[1:10:56] you need the Holy Spirit to produce
[1:10:58] those things in your life amen
[1:10:59] praise God that's what you need the Holy
[1:11:01] Spirit down here amen praise God but
[1:11:03] then it comes so to me a man the Holy
[1:11:07] Spirit God gave them the law back in the
[1:11:10] Moses time amen circumcision they were
[1:11:12] circumcised they meant and later on in
[1:11:14] the same chapter they forgot about that
[1:11:17] they forgot about therefore that's why
[1:11:19] they were not practicing it anymore so
[1:11:22] they may have had the word of Moses a
[1:11:24] man they may have had circumcision at
[1:11:26] that time but that was not good for this
[1:11:28] hour that was not good for this hour
[1:11:31] because even at the cross a man because
[1:11:34] circumcision is a type of the Holy
[1:11:35] Spirit amen
[1:11:36] circumcise in your life amen even at the
[1:11:39] cross amen even at this at the headstone
[1:11:42] you're still gonna have fights you're
[1:11:44] still gonna have battles you're still
[1:11:46] gonna have problems in your life and the
[1:11:48] Holy Spirit you need to have the Holy
[1:11:49] Spirit amen and your life now the
[1:11:53] headstone amen he's that's Christ they
[1:11:56] may we know this message is the
[1:11:57] headstone they meant praise God
[1:11:59] but you believe this message I believe
[1:12:01] this message praise God but I'm still
[1:12:03] struggling I'm still battling Amen I'm
[1:12:07] still having trial of trials Amen I'm
[1:12:09] still having problems Amen but you need
[1:12:12] to continue moving on with Christ amen
[1:12:14] you need to continue moving on with
[1:12:16] Christ praise God in order to obtain
[1:12:18] your
[1:12:19] full redemption of your body amen praise
[1:12:21] God I hope that was kind of I hope you
[1:12:24] understand what I'm trying to say hey
[1:12:25] man hmm so circumcision represents
[1:12:29] cutting off the flesh by the Holy Ghost
[1:12:31] and remember Joshua represents grace
[1:12:35] Joshua is also a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:38] now brother Bram said that the great
[1:12:40] Joshua the Holy Ghost that received a
[1:12:42] promise from God that come down to lead
[1:12:45] us amen so he gives him he says he says
[1:12:49] here that he's the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:50] praise God now remember and of course
[1:12:55] remember that Joshua is also a type of
[1:12:57] Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:59] Joshua and brother Graham says Joshua
[1:13:01] was a type of Jesus because Joshua means
[1:13:04] Jehovah Savior amen he was a type of
[1:13:06] Jesus praise God so we know that the
[1:13:12] Amen we know that this message is the
[1:13:15] capstone amen praise God but this
[1:13:19] message a man will with with this word a
[1:13:22] man will produce the body change amen if
[1:13:24] you stay with this word Amen praise God
[1:13:27] and and I believe I believe what the
[1:13:30] scripture says that you must how the
[1:13:34] scripture said being born again ready
[1:13:36] man
[1:13:37] praise God it's not just you're born
[1:13:40] again one time and you receive Christ
[1:13:42] one time and that's it Amen you must
[1:13:44] constantly die out to yourself amen
[1:13:46] praise God even at the cross amen praise
[1:13:49] God even that you but that's why God
[1:13:52] told him amen circumcise yourself again
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:55] young people they men listen to me for
[1:13:57] just a moment just because you were born
[1:13:59] in this message just because God your
[1:14:02] mom and dad believed brother Branham
[1:14:04] said brother Branham is a prophet and
[1:14:06] and you've come to church all the days
[1:14:08] of your life
[1:14:08] every Sunday you have not missed every
[1:14:11] one's that you have not missed amen you
[1:14:13] must needs to be circumcised they get
[1:14:15] spiritually amen
[1:14:18] you have because all you've done is just
[1:14:21] gone through the motions and the
[1:14:23] children of Israel that had just crossed
[1:14:25] all he did they were just they were
[1:14:27] following the word but they were not
[1:14:30] circumcised
[1:14:32] they were not circumcised that's what
[1:14:35] the Bible says and they they were even
[1:14:39] and in the end the message so called on
[1:14:43] the other side already had crossed over
[1:14:45] into Jordan and they were not
[1:14:47] circumcised so there's a difference
[1:14:50] between being in the message and the
[1:14:51] message being in unity meant that's a
[1:14:54] difference praise God amen you need to
[1:14:58] have the Holy Spirit that was
[1:14:59] experienced with the Holy Spirit young
[1:15:01] people children listen to me you need to
[1:15:02] have an experience with Christ but for
[1:15:04] yourself you can't say oh brother Dale
[1:15:07] I'm going in cuz brother Dale you know
[1:15:09] preaches the word know they'll needs to
[1:15:14] have his own experience as well oh I'm
[1:15:16] going there because my mom and dad they
[1:15:18] go to church every single Sunday nope
[1:15:20] you're not going in because of that
[1:15:21] right you need to know what Christ amen
[1:15:25] you need to have the new birth for your
[1:15:27] own self young people children amen
[1:15:31] praise the Lord and this message is the
[1:15:36] headstone we know that and it's crying
[1:15:37] grace grace grace amen
[1:15:39] praise God when they got to that you
[1:15:41] know that is all grace Joshua
[1:15:43] representing grace amen
[1:15:45] hmm now again if none of this is
[1:15:49] sounding correct Dale I want to be
[1:15:52] corrected amen praise God but this is
[1:15:55] you know cuz I wanna I wanna I want to
[1:15:58] be right man praise God I'm not a type
[1:16:00] of minister that out you know you take
[1:16:02] it or take it or leave it you know I
[1:16:04] want to be corrected if I'm wrong you
[1:16:06] see what I'm saying I believe any God
[1:16:07] called ministry will have that desire a
[1:16:09] man praise God
[1:16:11] but even in the headstone a man you
[1:16:13] still had to fight a man to death right
[1:16:16] even in this message you still have to
[1:16:18] fight the devil praise God in this hour
[1:16:20] you still have to fight the devil amen
[1:16:23] this message is our land in the Holy
[1:16:26] Ghost but we still have physical fleshly
[1:16:27] problems they meant because why even
[1:16:31] when they crossed over Jericho was still
[1:16:33] needing to be conquered this Jericho
[1:16:37] needs still to be conquered right amen
[1:16:40] this Jericho still needs to fall this
[1:16:44] land still this this this
[1:16:45] this fleshly body needs to fall off amen
[1:16:49] in order for us to move on amen and
[1:16:51] obtain our full inheritance amen they
[1:16:55] crossed over whoa
[1:16:57] we crossed over we're here but God says
[1:17:00] circumcise the children of Israel again
[1:17:03] praise God praise the Lord
[1:17:07] think about that Saints Amen because the
[1:17:11] body change I mean remember circumcision
[1:17:13] represents the Holy Ghost circumcised
[1:17:15] Saints we all have things in our life
[1:17:17] that we're still have to battle with a
[1:17:19] man that don't say that you're holy in
[1:17:23] it you have angel wings you know because
[1:17:25] I know none of you I don't see an angel
[1:17:27] wings around you and I don't see halos
[1:17:29] all over your heads each and every one
[1:17:32] of us has struggles that we're still
[1:17:34] battling with they meant and we're in
[1:17:36] the message of the hour right
[1:17:41] so that means God's still doing the work
[1:17:44] and you and me God's still expecting
[1:17:47] amen God still wants to circumcise you
[1:17:50] for the second time in there
[1:17:52] praise God amen hallelu I believe that
[1:17:56] and so that body change will not be
[1:18:00] produced without the Holy Spirit amen
[1:18:02] you must have it for your own self and
[1:18:05] that's why we must see what the Holy
[1:18:07] Spirit is currently doing for our day
[1:18:09] amen
[1:18:10] follow what God is doing it in our day
[1:18:11] night now verse four and let's just read
[1:18:15] this this quickly verse four it says and
[1:18:17] this is the cause why Joshua did
[1:18:19] circumcise all the people that came out
[1:18:21] of Egypt that were males even all the
[1:18:23] men of war died in the wilderness by the
[1:18:25] way after they came out of the Egypt and
[1:18:28] with all due respect to great men a man
[1:18:31] they that came out out from under
[1:18:34] brother branham a man they passed and
[1:18:36] have gone on to obtain their reward Amen
[1:18:41] brother branham has passed and gone on
[1:18:45] matter of fact he did not even obtain a
[1:18:48] body change he's actually waiting for
[1:18:51] you and me
[1:18:52] that might sound strange to some people
[1:18:55] but that's the truth he's waiting for
[1:18:58] you and me to come to this full
[1:19:01] inheritance he came to adoption I
[1:19:09] believe that with all my heart he that
[1:19:12] he's dead and gone
[1:19:15] his message still lives on with all due
[1:19:19] respect to the Prophet but he's waiting
[1:19:21] for you and me to come to this position
[1:19:23] praise God
[1:19:25] he's waiting for you and I because
[1:19:27] that's what the scripture says has to
[1:19:29] happen first and it's not gonna be a
[1:19:30] private resurrection for brother Branham
[1:19:32] to come give us something that he hasn't
[1:19:34] already priest mm-hmm a lot of those
[1:19:37] people that are waiting for brother
[1:19:38] Branham to come again when brother if
[1:19:40] brother Branham comes again and starts
[1:19:42] preaching again like they think that's
[1:19:44] gonna happen I believe brother Branham
[1:19:46] was Bisbal gonna be resurrect and he
[1:19:47] could preach for 40 days or whatever
[1:19:50] that's fine
[1:19:51] I'll accept that that's no problem but I
[1:19:54] believe those people who believe that
[1:19:55] he'll come and put up a tent and all
[1:19:57] those things you know the way it's all
[1:19:59] involved that they think it's gonna
[1:20:01] happen brother Brennan will be the last
[1:20:03] person they'd want to see then good
[1:20:06] brother Branham will blast it brother
[1:20:10] BAM will blast them for not obeying and
[1:20:12] hearing the word that he had already
[1:20:14] given them I'd be the last person they'd
[1:20:19] want to see praise God
[1:20:25] verse 5 says now all the people that
[1:20:28] came out were circumsized out of Egypt
[1:20:30] but all the people that were born in the
[1:20:33] wilderness were born in the message you
[1:20:35] know so call by the way as they came
[1:20:38] forth out of Egypt then they had not
[1:20:39] circumcised and there was a commandment
[1:20:42] given to Abraham passed down to Moses
[1:20:45] that needed to be fulfilled it was God's
[1:20:46] Word where the children of Israel walked
[1:20:49] 40 years in the wilderness to all the
[1:20:51] people that were men of war which came
[1:20:53] out of Egypt were consumed because they
[1:20:55] observe obey not the voice of the Lord
[1:20:57] in our day the people have gone and gone
[1:21:01] by the grave a man
[1:21:03] they then obtain a man this the the full
[1:21:06] Redemption the body changed that we're
[1:21:08] we're so desiring and we're in the cusps
[1:21:11] of receiving amen
[1:21:12] they didn't come to that they're waiting
[1:21:15] for you and I to come to that amen
[1:21:17] praise God and then they can raise a
[1:21:19] name unto whom the Lord swear that he
[1:21:23] would not show them the land which the
[1:21:25] Lord swear unto their fathers that he
[1:21:27] would give us a land that flows with
[1:21:28] milk and honey and their children whom
[1:21:31] he raised up in their stead them Joshua
[1:21:33] circumcised for the four they were
[1:21:35] uncircumcised because they had not
[1:21:37] circumcised him by the way amen
[1:21:41] so the people imagine God telling Joshua
[1:21:45] to four to do this for the second time
[1:21:48] and in the children of Israel they were
[1:21:52] what 20 25 years old maybe they were
[1:21:55] older they had to submit to that word
[1:21:58] and submit to Joshua the Holy Ghost in
[1:22:01] the hour amen to sit to say yes we
[1:22:05] submit to that circumcise us again the
[1:22:08] Holy Spirit circumcise again amen praise
[1:22:13] God that's the reason why Saints I want
[1:22:17] to I want to listen to what God is doing
[1:22:19] in our day and I want to obey what God
[1:22:22] is doing I want I want not forgetting
[1:22:25] what God has done but I want to hear
[1:22:27] also what God is doing and follow Amen
[1:22:30] because then I might miss that second
[1:22:32] circumcision and you might miss it and
[1:22:35] we don't want that because that was part
[1:22:38] of this process of this transition God
[1:22:41] was turning the corner that's what
[1:22:43] needed to happen
[1:22:44] amen mmm and it came to pass when they
[1:22:48] had done circumcised and all the people
[1:22:49] that they abode in their places in the
[1:22:51] camp till they were whole and the Lord
[1:22:53] said unto Joshua this day have out
[1:22:55] rolled away the reproach of Egypt from
[1:22:57] off of you
[1:22:58] wherefore the name of the place is
[1:22:59] called Gil gone to this day in Egypt
[1:23:01] where represents the world when you
[1:23:03] received the Holy Ghost no matter if you
[1:23:05] walked in this message all of your life
[1:23:07] but when you're really born again amen
[1:23:09] the world should start falling off of
[1:23:11] you amen
[1:23:12] it may not happen right there all at
[1:23:15] once but it'll start happening if
[1:23:17] there's been a new birth new a real new
[1:23:20] birth that has taken place in your life
[1:23:21] praise God you know when you're really
[1:23:26] born again you will not be bored at
[1:23:28] church you will love coming to church
[1:23:34] you know you will not young people you
[1:23:37] will not be bored and looking at your
[1:23:40] your watch and looking back and going to
[1:23:42] the bathroom every single 10 minutes you
[1:23:46] want to hear hear what God has to say if
[1:23:49] the new birth has really taken place in
[1:23:51] your life but if not you know then it's
[1:23:54] just another church service and that
[1:23:56] just doesn't go for the young people it
[1:23:58] goes for us adults as well we're just as
[1:24:00] antsy as they are praise God and I
[1:24:05] include myself in that too and the
[1:24:09] children of Israel and Campton Gilgal
[1:24:11] and kept the Passover after the
[1:24:13] circumcision they kept the Passover on
[1:24:15] the fourteenth day of the month at even
[1:24:16] even at the plains of Jericho so when
[1:24:18] the Holy Ghost had circumsized has
[1:24:21] circumsized you it needs to feed off the
[1:24:23] lamb right that's what the Passover
[1:24:27] represented they fed off the lamb back
[1:24:29] in the in Exodus amen and they weren't
[1:24:32] feeding off an old Exodus Land
[1:24:35] no that's hey Dave it was something
[1:24:37] fresh man but they were feeding off a
[1:24:41] fresh Holy Ghost Land for that day
[1:24:43] amen and they day they eat up the old
[1:24:45] corner of the land on the morrow after
[1:24:47] the Passover unleavened cakes and
[1:24:49] parched corn in the same same day hey
[1:24:51] man you're gonna start eating meat now
[1:24:54] amen you're not you're not crying Abba
[1:24:56] Father anymore you're gonna start eating
[1:24:59] meat praise God you're gonna start
[1:25:01] eating the the strong things of God amen
[1:25:04] in 1st Corinthians 3 Paul says here in
[1:25:07] verse 2 it says have I have fed you with
[1:25:10] milk and not with me talking to the
[1:25:13] Corinthians for hitherto you were not
[1:25:15] able to bear it neither yet now are ye
[1:25:17] able for a year for ye are yet carnal
[1:25:20] and you still see that same carnality
[1:25:22] here even amongst our ranks for whereas
[1:25:25] there is
[1:25:25] among you envying and strife and
[1:25:27] divisions and you or not and are you not
[1:25:30] carnal and walkers man for while one
[1:25:32] saith I am appalled and another I am of
[1:25:34] apollos are you not carnal you know oh
[1:25:38] you know I stay with just the tapes only
[1:25:41] and you know know being carnal man
[1:25:47] Hebrews the five eleven says for
[1:25:51] everyone that youssef milk is unskillful
[1:25:52] in the word of righteousness for he is a
[1:25:56] babe but strong meat belongeth to them
[1:25:59] that are full age so those who have been
[1:26:02] circumcised for the second time even
[1:26:05] those who by reason of use have their
[1:26:07] senses exercised to discern both good
[1:26:08] and evil amen
[1:26:09] and then the last part here in verse 13
[1:26:13] of Joshua I appreciate the brothers back
[1:26:15] there they're just trying to keep up
[1:26:17] with me
[1:26:17] amen it says and it came to pass when
[1:26:20] Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up
[1:26:22] his eyes and looked and behold there
[1:26:24] stood a man over against him with his
[1:26:26] sword drawn in his hand amen
[1:26:28] that can't be none other than Christ
[1:26:30] himself amen because watch and Joshua
[1:26:33] went unto him and said unto Him art thou
[1:26:35] for us or for our adversaries amen
[1:26:38] and look everything that God had
[1:26:41] commanded Joshua for the people to do
[1:26:43] was done they were walking properly then
[1:26:47] God stepped on the scene same thing that
[1:26:50] happened when Moses when Abraham looked
[1:26:53] up one day and he had done what God had
[1:26:56] told him to do amen
[1:26:57] he saw the three men coming down amen
[1:27:00] God Himself visiting him amen and God
[1:27:03] stepped on the scene and blessed him
[1:27:06] amen and he in verse 14 and he said nay
[1:27:09] but as a captain of the host of Lord am
[1:27:10] I now come and Joshua fell on his face
[1:27:12] to the earth and did worship and that
[1:27:14] person that he was worshiping didn't say
[1:27:16] don't worship me he was receiving that
[1:27:18] worship so it was God himself what saith
[1:27:21] my lord unto his servant verse 15 and
[1:27:24] the captive the Lord's host said unto
[1:27:25] Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot
[1:27:27] for the place where I'm destined this is
[1:27:29] holy in Joshua did so just like Moses at
[1:27:32] the burning bush they meant same thing
[1:27:34] was happening here amen amen
[1:27:36] and and and this
[1:27:38] event would not have taken place if both
[1:27:40] Joshua and the people were not subject
[1:27:42] and in full obedience to the word for
[1:27:44] that hour for that hour I just do the
[1:27:49] word of Moses but to the word for that
[1:27:52] and finish in here this quote brother
[1:27:58] Graham says but the believers adoption
[1:28:00] but the believers the Caleb and Joshua
[1:28:02] outfit that was going on to the promised
[1:28:05] they moved on over into the land and
[1:28:07] took the land and settled down in the
[1:28:09] land as a possession and we never
[1:28:11] stopped at justification sanctification
[1:28:13] let's go on to the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:15] Spirit let's not stop at believing on
[1:28:17] the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not
[1:28:20] stop because he cleaned us up from a
[1:28:21] life of sin but now we pressed on into a
[1:28:23] position to a promise of the baptism of
[1:28:26] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:28:27] and because Saints people feel like
[1:28:31] there's something that they have to do
[1:28:33] in this hour is still a Catholic
[1:28:35] mentality and the people amen
[1:28:37] like there's something that they have to
[1:28:38] do there's nothing that you can do amen
[1:28:41] just do the word amen obey the word and
[1:28:44] then they and you'll produce the word
[1:28:46] amen that's all you have to do amen
[1:28:50] oh you know I must need to travel to
[1:28:53] Indiana you know to to to listen to the
[1:28:55] word no you need to listen to the word
[1:28:59] amen the word if the word is being
[1:29:03] preached at a local church Amen listen
[1:29:05] to the word there may need to be brother
[1:29:08] brems not standing behind that pulpit
[1:29:10] there I'm gonna tell you that right now
[1:29:15] brother Brandon says here I'll finish
[1:29:18] with this one I promise in the message
[1:29:21] paradox now they were baptized repented
[1:29:24] and were baptized and come out to walk
[1:29:26] in a new life in a new land in a newness
[1:29:28] journey amongst new people in the hand
[1:29:31] of God upon them but it finally came to
[1:29:33] a place in this walk that they had that
[1:29:35] they was not satisfied with their walk
[1:29:37] of grace they had come they had to come
[1:29:40] to something that they could do
[1:29:42] themselves that's how the people of it
[1:29:44] the people of Israel got to they felt
[1:29:47] like you know this isn't enough I need
[1:29:50] to do something else you know and
[1:29:52] that's just Catholicism now that's where
[1:29:54] people think today of divine healing or
[1:29:56] so many other work of grace of God that
[1:29:58] that there is something that you have to
[1:30:00] do you you there is nothing you have to
[1:30:02] do but believe just believe God and they
[1:30:05] if they would have continued on the
[1:30:07] promise wasn't given them under the law
[1:30:09] the promise was given before the law
[1:30:11] without any conditions to it I have
[1:30:13] given you this land
[1:30:15] go on over into it but before they got
[1:30:18] to that promise they decided there was
[1:30:19] something they must do themselves and
[1:30:22] that we still find that among human
[1:30:25] beings we're prone to be that way there
[1:30:28] is something that we've got to do we
[1:30:30] feel that with that we've got to have
[1:30:32] something into it also God doesn't want
[1:30:35] you to mix yourself for your ideas with
[1:30:37] this word amen
[1:30:38] it wants you to leave your ideas and
[1:30:40] your interpretations out of it you do
[1:30:43] have something into it that's your
[1:30:45] surrender of your own will your own idea
[1:30:48] to the will and idea of Almighty God and
[1:30:50] it's finished that's all there is just
[1:30:52] take his promise don't think of nothing
[1:30:54] else walk by it and God does the rest of
[1:30:57] it amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so
[1:31:00] how many want to turn the corner as
[1:31:02] God's turn in the corners amen I want to
[1:31:04] follow amen I want to follow in this
[1:31:07] hour amen I don't want to get ahead of
[1:31:09] the word amen I want to follow what the
[1:31:12] word is doing amen I want to look up to
[1:31:14] it amen but respecting the ministry and
[1:31:16] what God is doing through men in our day
[1:31:18] as well amen
[1:31:20] because those are just as much God
[1:31:22] called man as brother Branham was a God
[1:31:24] called man we know that he had a
[1:31:26] position Amen that we can't we can't
[1:31:28] have that position but that position is
[1:31:31] not working here amongst us anymore he's
[1:31:34] gone he's left us a word we want to we
[1:31:38] want to see what that word says and
[1:31:40] obtained amen brother Branham caught he
[1:31:44] caught a glimpse of it but he didn't he
[1:31:46] saw what he what he wanted the people to
[1:31:48] reach but he didn't reach it himself
[1:31:51] that's our job man that's our job and
[1:31:55] he's waiting amen for you and me amen
[1:31:58] to get to that position not just him all
