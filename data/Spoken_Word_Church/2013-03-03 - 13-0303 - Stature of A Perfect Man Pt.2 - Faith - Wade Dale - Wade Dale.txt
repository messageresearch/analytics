TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it doesn't matter you can get it off of this right hand yeah i got it on the kindle yeah sure yeah i mean i'm not looking for when i say a book now remember one thing we're in the 21st century book can mean iphone ipad thurman how about but don't use the eye palm like i do i still write stuff in my palm and i tell them i got the new ipam god gave it to me about 53 years ago is there a difference between this book in the other book no no not your perfect man book it should be uh you may have got one that wasn't many in the 70s it was a bridge but the unabridged ones like that one and all the others abridged means that they took the uggs and the odds and the ease out you know brother man would go uh uh uh well they took that out well then they put it on a bridge where if he said it that's exactly what they put down right i like that which is better that way yeah so it's more let's turn to the second peter and for some of y'all i want you to i want you to listen to this we had a great uh bible study last night i endure you in the name of the lord to be at the next one right whatever you've got on saturday night that's important it ain't as important as the word of god sorry the word of god is more important but we're studying on adoption and the status of perfect man and man we're getting into some real boy last night it was 8 30 before we got finished we just kept going anyway and he wasn't finished we had to just stop him right you know i got a call today so so just just really i mean there's really um there's nothing more important i i don't see that there is i mean there's things you have to do in life sure but this coming month in may or april april try to be here try to be here just try to be here because we really got into some things last night and you know what it cleared up a lot of things that even the older ones got out of it plus the younger ones but folks this is a requirement this is not something that you might do or could do or an option in the end time this statue of birth man's not an option it's a requirement you've got to go up that statue of a perfect man or you're facing death because of being in the end time this is what it requires what we were reading last night so let's turn to second peter because see last sunday was kind of a shocker to you which is good that it shook you up you know why you gotta know where you are before you can start somewhere you got to know where your mind is before you can start okay so maybe i hope i took your hard drive and destroyed it destroyed your hard drive so now what you start adding information that you need because of misinterpreted theology which is anti-word right we had these thoughts and we had these ideas and we had these well as long as i said in a message church i'm okay that's the most damnable place to be if you're not born again but now look some have expressed uh and not just one but several have expressed they're uh wondering if they have the new birth and if you don't if you don't have the new birth you can still learn these you say oh how the disciples were not born again right but for three and a half years god sat there and he pounded that word into him through jesus christ he sat there but when the holy ghost fell guess what it done it shot him up to here right back from there brought back the remember things which because that's what the holy ghost said it would do it will show you things to come bring back to your remembrance whatsoever i've said and show you things to come all right so if we all realize that we're right here and this thing is anti-word which it is this is anti-word all right dad just dad just lifted it right up when we went upstairs sunday if you heard what he said about martin luther and the soul martin luther was right but in his mind he was the anti-word that's what i said and you know a lot of y'all have a problem with it but that's okay if you got a problem with it i don't mind but just realize one thing we are anti-christ until we're in christ our mind our intelligence our thinking is anti-word we were born wrong born wrong but now look you say well i don't like you say that why not let's start right there though because god has made a way that's right to make it right he's made a way to keep us from being anti that's right see but you got to get a foundation first right you got to do what is removable in the book of zechariah zerubbabel cleaned off the foundation right you can't just go you see this old house back here that this man's tearing down now he didn't just build a house right around that or on top of that what do you do he cleaned off the trash got it down to the foundation and i'll guarantee he's probably going to build him a house or something but he had to get all that trash out of the way all right i was just going to say it why have a problem with being born wrong but i mean you can't get right if you're not wrong and to realize you're wrong to realize you're wrong then god can help you to be right i wasn't trying to leave everybody hanging last sunday we but we're born anti-war but there is a way back there's an entrance we read it last night we're going to read it right now so let's read this then we'll let the prophet read it everybody see that now joe can you see it okay okay good all right thank god for by the way technology no i'm not thank you sheriff now i am hello everybody good morning you you got it up there yeah okay i don't have the thing i'll do it they can't hear me we can get it off that recording okay i'm loud enough don't we sing yeah somebody read this yeah yeah you don't need them peter chapter one let's read it now let's go and let's read i want you to read it like we did last night in the bible study simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them so that's a special group i circled that in my bible to them if you're one of them then you're like peter which had the baptism of the holy ghost all right to them that have obtained that word obtained means entrance all right you've been you've obtained something all right light precious faith with us through there's another entrance through there's a door been made open through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of our lord jesus christ our jesus our lord according as his divine power now look at all these divines hath given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life look life lessons that's what we're learning about right we're not gonna be need to talk this statue of a perfect man when we get to glory but we are gonna be at different places that's what we're talking about last night and levels of understanding but this is to get us through to this requirement see to understand the seals you got to be right here at the faith of the fathers all right so now we'll get into that later on because that's a long ways after we get finished with all the virtues to life and godliness so it's pertaining to life what you do in life and it's pertaining to your godliness or your christian walk through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given now what does the word given mean gift he give these all right unto us exceeding not just a little exceeding overflowing great and precious promises that by these the prophet said these promises we'll read the man you might be partakers of the divine nature this statue of a perfect man is the divine nature of almighty god it is god himself living through human flesh right all right but you got to start somewhere you got to start by cleaning the thing out and then later on we're going to read about sister shepard's dream maybe not today where she dreamed and and the pyramid was there and there was water flowing out and brother brown said there was trash coming out you still got trash in you at the new birth yeah you still got trash in you at the new birth or we wouldn't need this growth development all right remember just like jonas jonas has every faculty he needs to drive a car he's not going to gain any new parts or eyes or hands or feet but he's going to grow in coordination he's going to grow in development of learning knowledge of being able to drive a car but he's still got the brain right there that he's always going to have so when you're born again when the baby's born you got what you need like i was telling bob this morning brother ramsay when you become born again you got enough power in you to create a world and go live on it but there's a bar holding you what is it memory reason conscious affection imagination of this world this world it has encased or like a capsule all the stuff you need is inside the capsule but this stuff is holding the capsule together which is called us and that's why we have to do this or we have to go by the grave remember we preaching on purging you're purged two ways you're either purge when you're alive or you purge when you die death purges the old you because when you resurrect you're not going to come back up the same listen to me the same person you were right that samuel and peggy dale brought forth right you're going to be made new a new but you're still going to have this but it's going to be made new that's why the bible says that we can't see god in this flesh we can't take this flesh to heaven this flesh to heaven right right it's got to be changed that's right so that's what it's doing now because this is anti but we're going to be changed because the bible says we plant them in corruption this is corruption but we raise them in incorruption what death destroys the effect of the fall because once a christian resurrects he's never going to fall again but see we're in a fallen condition but there's going to be a group of people that's going to stand on the earth and death is not going to be able to hold this and we're going to be changed in the moment in 2012 that's the promise but it's not going to happen right here it's not going to happen in virtue no it's temp no no those people die they have to be purged god wants a full stature right right okay never understand he wants a full stature right here at the headstone that's what he wants that's what he requires because listen to this watch excuse me whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust all right and besides this what besides the new birth that's what he's saying besides because he's giving you the divine nature besides this add to your faith so see there's seven as but it doesn't start at faith if you do there's eight there's eight it's not really look at somebody we got the chart last night it says add to your faith one two three four five six number seven is love right add to your faith well right there it is i'm sorry yeah add to your faith one two three four five six seven all right add to your faith sure faith is faith is the foundation right and to your faith and to your faith i need to postpone that i don't want that to happen right now all right and besides this what besides this new birth that you just received giving all diligence now that doesn't mean dilatory that means diligence that means you got to get up and do it add to your faith is something you have required it's a gift god's given you the new birth so add to your faith in other words what i said last night add this to the bible it's not an addition but listen it's between the lines add to what you believe virtue and to what you believe knowledge see add to what you believe you got to believe those who believe yes the bible says believe it and do knowledge temperance temperance patience patience godliness godless brother kindness brother kindness charity or love which is the top for if these things be in you in you not on you not an anointing but in you and abound and abound abound means that if you didn't just get four apples off your tree you got 400 apples off your tree you're free abounded with fruit that's the same thing with you and i they make you now that word mate there means just like i'm gonna make jim get up and go to town tomorrow there's a requirement that you go to town and i'm the head so i'm going to say you need to go it's going to make you but if she has these virtues in her if we have these virtues and it's going to make us do this you see what i'm saying it's going to make you be fruitful because if it doesn't look they make you that you shall neither be barren or unfruitful so if you do that it's going to make you productive and very fruitful all right automatically automatically it's going to make you that's worth making i've underlined it for years that's what it's that's what it's telling us it'll make you do these things all right it'll make you that you shall neither be bear nor fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind that word blind is gross darkness all right you're blind if you don't see these things you're blind yes and cannot see it far off what revelation all right and have forgotten that you were purged from your old sins no words backslid you forgot where you came from so this is written to christians remember this is people with like precious faith so he's not jumped over and talked to sinners he's still talking to christians all right everybody got there but either lack of these things is blind even if you're a christian you can be blind how many of us become newborn christians and then we see more and more right right that's right that means we were blind to it that's right right yeah man okay but now once light's been given to you if you still are blinded then you need to go back and get born again right see that's where you realize whether you're born again or not it's whether the word that you see now you may not see everything but god just shows you little things along the way and he'll help you with the little things along the way to make sure that you know that you're a christian but don't forget that you were purged from your old sins don't forget where you came from that's what i said last sunday that's what this says and forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren in other words don't be in darkness rather do this give diligence to make your calling an election sure sisters and brothers it's not just preachers and deacons 120 in the upper room that were that were at the faith of the fathers there were some women there amen there was some women in that wasn't just 120 men no the lord jesus's mama was there mary was there she received virtue knowledge temperatures goddess brother countless right sure she did because they went out a very mildly church you got to have the sisters involved also you just if she just knew her place mary didn't jump out and start preaching the word of god that's right sounds right she ain't getting a pulpit and get her a church no she got the sisters together she told her sisters about god she told the sisters about this she because brother brown said a holy ghost-filled woman can help you if you'll listen to her all right wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure now here's a promise i triple underlined this and wrote promise for if ye do these things ye shall never fall now is that a promise or what you shall never fall sure we'll do things wrong sure what but you shall never fall what fall away from the truth the truth's going to always be there and the truth is going to hold you up you will never fall all right for so an entrance a door shall be ministered unto you abundantly now minister you've got to listen to preachers fivefold of them sorry that's the way we chose it okay that's what we chose we chose to live you gotta listen to fivefold ministry that's right you can't get this all by yourself sorry because it says for an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly not just once a month right abundantly let's take these words together and read them abundantly look at the promises into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things paul i mean peter was a preacher right anointed preacher and he said i'm going to always give you a remembrance of these things look at that next one though you know them you see that though you know them i'm going to bring these to you remember though you even know them and be established in the present truth that's today this present truth right here today you're going to be established if we do these things now let's let brother branham read out of the statue of a perfect man so now let us read now first peter or second peter rather the first chapter portion of it simon peter servant the apostle of jesus christ to them to have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ i like the way that stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith see let me read that again listen close simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ to them that obtain obtain light precious faith through the righteousness of god our savior jesus christ notice he is saying that i have obtained this faith and i'm addressing to them that has attained like precious faith so he's addressing the christians all right i want it's not to the outside world so this is not don't go trying to say anything about statue of a perfect man to uh somebody out in the world they'll like you like crazy okay so don't there's certain things marriage and divorce and all things like that don't it's not for the world don't even give it to the world if they come in then you can teach them but forget about it okay let's see grace all right the outside world this is to the church those that are in christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and through of our lord of our jesus of jesus christ our lord according as his as his divine power has given unto us all things his divine power now has given unto us all things that pertain into life godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are we given unto given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these prophets said these promises he might we might be partakers of the divine nature now let that soak in real deep now not preaching this morning we're just teaching divine nature let me read that fourth verse again so you won't miss it whereby we are given whereby we are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is god's requirement that's his requirement all right so brother branham is opening a door like peter did an entrance for us to get back to the statue of a perfect man to the faith of the fathers all right there's not a person in here that loves god but wants to become more like christ now it's laid out here every christian i'm an old veteran look at brother and sister kid here they're probably the oldest in the building but if i'd ask them what is your heart's desire to be closer to god when you learn of christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into it then he told his wife he said i'd like to that's where he says here he says i love you so much so i'd like to take you and pull you inside of me so we could just be really be one more now that multiply that by a hundred million and then you'll find out how that the believer who falls in love with christ wants to get into him because it's a love and here he's going to show us how that through these promises we might be partakers of christ's divine nature these mortal body how that we can be protectors mortal body this is what's supposed to be working outside from the inside working his way outside all right he's talking about soul mating which is he didn't agree with that so and i don't either i'm not getting married to such a such a girl but that's that's the way it is with christ we got to be so in love with him until we ask for something and he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit right everybody understand that yes remember god's nose are the best answers you'll ever get yes that's right cc why and the only way you can do that is to become partakers of his divine nature then you'll understand the reason see god doesn't have to really give us a reason he's almighty he can just say no but he gives us a reason he tells us why he's not going to give it to us he says why become takers you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you that's what i want to see because sometimes we get we get all something we do we get all pouty with god yeah we do we do we get pounding with god i was just thinking when you were reading that that kind of correlates with a woman's role like being subject i mean it's kind of like the same thing like you should be able to subject totals sure right and if the husband says no he has a reason but if you're a little baby about it okay little baby about it we go pouty we that's what he's saying right there we go kind of pouty but now with this divine nature though with us with a sister that's under subjection to her husband and true subjection not as a slave but true subjection that you to live as one you'll understand the reason he can't give it to you and if we don't we just accept it we should accept it just like it is right because to be partakers of his divine nature he knows what you need before you ask for it so he knows that we can ask amiss but he can't ask amen and the holy ghost can't ask a miss a lot of things we do is in the flesh right a lot of things we do in the flesh it don't prosper right right but if you ever seen though to ask something of god and you get in a channel that god will answer that prayer and man you go well thank you god yes you know you say thank you god you answered that prayer but you know what he answered it in his time that's right see and in his place there's nothing you know we want there's a lot of things we want in this room you look at that right back there on that wall there's a lot of people we want in this church and we pray but do we pray diligent enough do we sign cry like daddy said for the abomination well that's an abomination that they're not here to me that's an abomination that those kids and people husbands and wives brothers and sisters are not in this church today right to me it's an abomination and i'm part of that i'm not saying i'm i'm over here and everyone no i'm an abomination see we go back to the end time part i realize every day when i get up i'm anti-word sorry i'm just i'm just against god even getting up in the morning you're against god because we're not going to go to sleep over there you're just thinking it's god does everybody understand that i don't care whether you believe it or not but do you understand what i'm saying you're always against god but now we can start though there's an entrance been made a door has been opened that we can take this divine nature and get rid of that i'm not saying we're yeah we'll have this thing until we die or be changed but it's going to be changed right brother brown said the greatest battle ever fought is not in here it's right here right here now if y'all don't agree with that you're you're lost if you don't agree that this right here is against god you're just you're just kidding yourself because when i knew when god came to me when you same way with everybody when god come to you you were so anti that's right until you didn't want god we weren't seeking god god was seeking so you weren't trying to press your way into god no you weren't now god did little things in your life to show you where you need to go but there come a point in time when god's going to go thunk i'm talking to you it's me yes i'm talking to you now and then what do you do god knew you would accept it or reject it there's your predestination he knew you would come to a point yes lord and he would say one word from the pulpit or one word from somebody testifying to you and you'd go oh i'm so wrong i'm so wrong everything i do is so wrong to god right that's not the way you started that's the way everybody should have started you know we all start with different experiences but it's always the same it's always i'm wrong what's repent repent means to turn around because i'm wrong and i need to go that way all right go ahead i remember when i got mine i was on my way i had listened to tate that night and i was on my way to work and i was facing the world trade villain and i walked across the street and it came to me god chose me i felt so good all that time i was thinking i chose god and when i mean it was just a revelation i went down the elevator i said god show me and when i find out that god told me thank you but god knows that that's the reaction we as humans how much more would it be that we know that this infinite man has chose you from seven billion people that's right and he come and found you that's right that gives me cold chills he come and found you you didn't go find god there's not one human thing you can do to find out not one but he found here and he knew though he knew those sister journey when you that was revealed to you you'd accept it yeah well then right then what did brother brown say about the the brother that said well brother graham i don't know if i'm born again or not he said when you pick that track up boy how simple is that when you pick that track up and turn from whatever way you were doing you accepted that what was on the track just a little simple probably john 3 16. when you accepted that that's when you turned and you received god didn't understand that but is that the baptism of the no no wait a minute that's the same thing when he was saying you know the man said he lost god and he didn't go back where he found him right right and laid me down to sleep right now i'm sleeping just free go ahead but when when brother man was given an illustration and he and that's where he said that's not the baptism of the holy ghost well that's his journey that's where he begun but you got to remember one thing if you're truly justified let me make it real let me be this kind of a gray area but let me if you're truly justified right now you're justified god forgives you your past sins you're not born again in the family of god but if you're truly justified the bible said you're already glorified correct you will go on you will go on you have begun here and you will end here god saw if it's a true justification if it's truly that you were going in this direction and god turned you started going in that direction but 15 years later you turn around and go back in that direction you never got it to start with you just gotta you just got a feeling and the devil loves to give you feelings he loves to give you feelings but if god truly justifies you then he's already glorified you okay so that was his journey so we can say that's why brother brown said you can come up to the altar except jesus christ is your savior and you're a christian that doesn't mean you're born again that's right come on that doesn't mean you're born again that just means you're justified that means that right then if you died you'll go to heaven but you'll not be bribed because bride is only the ones that the holy ghost has come inside and you've accepted him in your walk that's right of justification sanctification about the holy ghost you've accepted that and you've walked in god he's showing you the word but if you go up um say no i'm gonna kill you okay nala is going to go up today and she's going to repent of her sins and she's really sorrowful but she gets killed in a car right going down the road god forbid that's going to happen we know it's not but if it does then then we can't say she's not a christian that's right no in god's eyes she's been forgiven chopped off that's what that is it chopped off everything from there back so where you stand completing god in the position you're supposed to be in completing god now if she continues on another five years and she's still doing what she was doing back here she just got a feeling she just got a a a religion an emotion but if you truly repent god's going to give you the holy ghost remember repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy shout which means it don't have to happen right then but it shall i didn't receive it when i first was baptized yes it took a little while but i sure felt clean when i came out of that water i sure felt god had took everything that i was before and thrown it in the sea and he can't bring that up no more but see remember if we continue to go to walking justification that same unclean spirit that made us do it it's still right here you may still smoke a cigarette that's true you may still drink a beer that's right right but there's going to come a time of sanctification where that's got to go out that's right the unclean spirit then will go out of a man right he walks in dry places he can rest find us none but he's going to come back and he's going to make you very religious all right so that's very you got to be careful with that that's the the sanctification part is a is a tough part to be in because remember judas is carrot was in the stage of sanctification he cast out devils he preached the gospel he did and he was sanctified but he never went on to receive you know what he did he did not believe what christ was saying all the way he believed part of what he was saying all right and that put him not in the body so he was able to do what he did he was able to deny god and become forever judas juditarian attitude that helped me you want to look at it yeah that really helped me which one do i need to count down the highlighted one okay countdown and the new birth as people talks that the baptism and holy ghost is in your birth now that's wrong the baptism of the holy ghost is different from the new birth the new birth is when you're born again but the holy ghost is when power comes into that birth for service now remember it's not totally two different acts it's the same act just showing you because you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of your life on your spirit and die and go to hell all right everybody else that would give you the anointing to cast out devils preach the gospel heal the sick right right and still be just as smutty inside as you always have been all right that's hard to understand but you got to remember joel said that the anointing that he says i'll pour out the holy ghost on all flesh in the end time it's on all flesh everybody that's why you get these people with anointings to do the things they do write songs which are evil but that's an anointing it's an anointing to do that the new birth you have the new birth by being believing on the lord jesus christ by having faith and accepting him as your savior that's birth see because you pass from death into life he hears my word and believe it see he's got life because he believes and that same group had to go to pentecost to be baptized with the holy ghost see what he's saying he's saying they had to go on further right all right holy ghost is power for service all right you shall receive the new birth after this what now you shall receive power acts 1 8 after this holy ghost has come upon you and they had already believed to eternal life and so forth but they had to have the holy ghost for power you shall be witness unto me after the holy ghost come upon you because the holy ghost is the witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in christ not a newborn baby but an adult all right so brother brown and that's where a lot of people say well brother brown says the new birthing holy ghost is different well there's a quote but you got to remember he's separating it it's the same act right if you're born again then something died right something died that's right but then brother branham clearly shows you that the holy ghost comes with power because in the upper room in the upper room they didn't just get eternal life and then get the holy ghost they got it all right they got all and they were adults in christ that's what he was reading acts 180 what that's acts 1 8. jesus said when the holy ghost come upon you it'd be well acts 2 38 when all that happened or acts 2 1. so they've become babies and you got to remember brother branham is talking about two different groups of people right we gotta go we're right in the middle of something but remember the holy ghost fell the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost on two different sets of people the ones in the upper room had been tutored by god himself and that fell on the word they held the three thousand downstairs just became babies right here same holy ghost but they started as babies okay okay we'll get into this
