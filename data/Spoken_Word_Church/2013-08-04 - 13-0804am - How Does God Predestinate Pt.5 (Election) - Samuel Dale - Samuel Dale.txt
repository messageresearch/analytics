========================================
all the service number 28 in the black notebook we don't know Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes out of my heart I want to see you amen and how do you want to see it shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love let's be holy holy amen pour out to the power and love and holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen and amen and amen and amen I want to see him don't you it's been a wonderful Journey but I still want to see him and good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Romans 8 where we've been reading and then we will go to Second Peter 1 Romans 8 2 Peter 1. we had a real good time last night at least I did at the Bible study everybody got to listen to me for an hour almost two hours so you know if I got any voice left we'll try to preach today but you know I didn't ask you if you would if you want to listen to it brother Joe would be glad to make you a copy so we got into a lot of things talking about the order of the rapture and coming down to it you know in dying and I hope you enjoyed it but remember that remember brother George Quinn will be with us uh this coming Sunday the 11th and brother Danny Monday will be with us on the third Sunday which is the 18th now if anybody wants to go along we are planning on trying to go up to the Friday night meeting at Ruth so if you want to go with us we will try to take the van and whatever Vehicles is possible to go up to be with them and but we got to leave wage that no later than two o'clock so if you're planning on going with us you'll have to let us know where we can make arrangements you know and try to leave from there by two o'clock because we got to get up in time for the service and it's about two hours and something right on the three hour drive so just remember that if you want to go with us let us know but don't show up 10 minutes after because you'll be left at home unless you drive okay because we we have to have schedules and things and uh you know to do that but just remember that okay Romans 8 28 and then second Peter 1. the heavenly father we thank you for this day we thank you for the hour that we're living the the time upon the Earth that we have to set aside a little time today to sit down and fellowship together about you we just asked you that you'd come on the scene now and speak to our hearts and our lives because that's what we desire more than anything it's a revelation because that will be what will change us the prophet said the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture so Lord we can look assuredly to a place in a time that you're going to reveal to us the reality of what is going on and then that will change our whole vile bodies and take us on off of the Earth but we love you and we thank you bless those that are not here remember Wade and June there's going up and in her ER Daddy's girlfriend's mother passing away we pray that you would just be with a family and take care of all of them people waiting them traveling Just Have Your Way remember these others some are missing but we commit them to you believing you'll take care of everything guide us now we love you and we thank you as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen laughs Romans 8. let's start 23 where we've been at it I mean 28 excuse me and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things amen it'd be the best thing to say if God be for us who can be against us amen all right we'll go over to second Peter 1 and verse 10. says wherefore the rather or therefore what for whatever see we're for the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure for if we do these things we shall never fall you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now I made about 50 copies of some of the quotes if one of you will that we've used lately and all on predestination and if it's not enough we will be glad to make some more but we've been talking on predestination now for quite a while this is message number five and we're just trying to get into a point because I ask you a question how does God predestinate how does he predestinate all right and we went through the point of seeing that uh the point is how does he predestinate we can understand the word predestinate because we talk about an eternal God I mean you know an infinite God and all kind of thing but how can he predetermine something to be and not then be a respecter of persons you know are be in the bases well I chose this one and didn't choose that one so we've been through Jacob and Esau trying to uh study the point and go through it and you know and trying to see thank you brother some things that oh the way he does it it's a very simple matter that he predestinates by foreknowledge he said well that's just too simple well you know come to find out sister uh Kathy while ago was showing me something that as many times as we spoke about the one God and the things but and not if she didn't see things before but brother 40 there Wednesday night when he's preaching he said something about God is a spirit it just opened up something and she had a revelation about one God well you know you say well well I got that right off well amen anytime you got it as long as it's revealed is the main thing but when it's just head knowledge see we can quote all of that and still not have the revelation of what it is a revelation will change things you don't have to worry about anything that's revealed to you I have no problems with anybody discussing it I don't care if it would be a theologian out of a denominational church or or whatever it would be I would not be a have no problems with discussing uh the Bible with them not that I would know as much as I would know I wouldn't even think about it but it the part that I do know we could talk about I'll talk to you about what's been revealed now the others we'll talk about this is your opinion and that's my opinion and and they're you know they're just like noses we all have one you know it's what gets us in trouble is our noses but but think about it how would God predestinate and not be picking one and rejecting another you know and then how would it be that he would all be saved no you know God would that all be saved but yet he knew that all would not be saved true I mean we understand that don't we that we understand that all won't be saved because people just will not accept it you know they just won't uh won't have anything to do with it or a thought because they have their preconceived ideas and once we do those things you know we we wind up uh having a problem uh Aaron would you come up and click the thing we've having so much trouble with our air conditioner system I clicked it up this morning on 72 and it's 72 but 71 you freeze to death now there's no 70 and a half or 71 and a half we've been running for the longest we're not even running a center fan it was only 71. I clicked it up to 72. and you start Fanning and everybody's burning to death right so what are we going to do I still say that I'm going down to Florida and I'm going to buy all of those little suits that they've got for those people that are at Disney World you know for Mickey Mouse and all because I asked one of them one time I said how in the world can you stand this hot temperature you know you're inside of that thing he said there's a little air conditioner in here so I'm going to go down one of these days and purchase so you get to pick out whether you're a Minnie Mouse or Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck and I'm going to give everybody one but it's got to have a heater and an air conditioner any word that you can all right we do the best we can forgive us but now how does God then predestinate and not just being choosing one and rejecting the other how does he do that so we've been dealing with it now for about four messages of what he does it by foreknowledge all right man all right Now by foreknowledge we say you have but we we just all talked about before now I can't help it that if the Armenian doctrine of foreknowledge runs into works and ideas and things like that and and dealing with life and the calvinistic runs into the well that we're just saved anyway it don't matter what we do see that would be going into the predetermined stamping It Like It Is God chose me for the world so hey Gloria I'm here I can live like the devil he said I don't say that no but that's where the doctrine come from at least you can just live like the devil Calvin had a man killed but he didn't believe in one God right so now you want to go with Calvinism or you want to go with armenianism or are we going to try to find a truth in God's word all right so I gave you a bunch of quotes to where you can read them but we've been over them brother Branham says predestination looks back to foreknowledge all right amen and foreknowledge looks to Destiny all right now then for knowledge is prior to predestination because if not he would be saying predestination you know would be first and then for knowledge you you can't make that in God and make him nor he wouldn't be a respecter person you got to make it to where the person can make a choice um is that not what the scripture says choose you this day whom you will serve now if we're going to believe that God just say so many and there's just so many sitting in the building today well the rest of you get up and go home you know it might as well that's right if that's the way you're going to think about it well see that's why I love foreknowledge because in foreknowledge God foreknew what I would do he foreknew my desires and he operates according to my desires gives me a connecting link into my salvation or what you want to call it or a thought that you know I do have something to do with this it's not just a flop back with and he shows me here if he showed me didn't you you know it means the life we live proves whether we're saved or not the life we live proves our predestination see then that gives me a great opportunity to think about it right greater than the fact that he just I just took it don't make no difference you see that's what people have taught on predestination well Paul didn't have a choice God just knocked him off the horse and made him take it no I'm glad the prophet would come along and we can depend upon his words from the day Paul stood there Darren Stone saw Stephen stoned from that day on Paul was not right he saw something real as mean as David is what it was we'll read in a minute where the Prophet said David I know your desires well that's something in it he knows what you want in any acts according to what you want but now if you ever stop wanting right you understand the point if you ever stop Desiring God in his ways and wanting him then you're sealing away your own Doom but if there's a desire in your heart for God there's got to be a God to answer that desire all right so then we can go back then and say to us it everything hinges on foreknowledge I've got a little drawing that I'm making for Joseph and he said he thought I'd done one like a few years ago in predestination but anyhow we'll put a little drawing up because see what I'm dealing with and what I've been dealing with in foreknowledge draw a line in your mind there's a line we're not back on this side of that line yet we're still out here we're not in time you know in looking at it we're looking at it as what God foreknew and you know that he foreknew that Jesus Christ would be slain right he foreknew that he foreign you you got to make him infinite or is your peanut brain and and what's he need and serve in that kind of a god you know I wrote a list of like the mind that we covered this Wednesday see when that line here this is God the infinite the Great Elohim self-existing the line that shows like where you would start with the mind and then going forward towards time and when we wind up in time if the Bible is right that Jesus was to be slain in the mind of God before the world is there any way that it could ever be that he wouldn't be slain now come on you got a carnality of the mind but that's not that's stupidity to think that God said it and then can't do it you know that's beyond carnality and see we look at it then as God's foreknowledge that he foreknew all things see then he knew whether you'd be here today or not but see you had a choice right amen and we'll get to it in a minute the scripture we read about making your calling an election sure that is after this message of II Peter of the Statue of a perfect man so then we we're going to tie together something the Lord willing if we can get into it but listen what your Prophet had to say we give these things over and over go ahead we're number one brother John all right brother Bob never wish they get back there and they kind of understaffed today because brother Benny he he decided to fly to California her back one of the two and I just hope it don't go under while he's out there you know maybe he'll be up off the ground and you know but anyhow just joking but listen what the prophet said in 1963 11 29 super sign but remember God's clock will be just exactly on time all these things has to be why it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire the Bible says he desired it all be saved right right all right desires he's not willing that any should perish but by his foreknowledge he knew he would accept it and who would not therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking because he knew back in the beginning and all of the things all right now God does a predestinate my desire because that would be choosing see I take this one reject that one take this one reject that one his desires would motivate him to just take a few but he doesn't do it that way he lays The Plan of Salvation before the world and I thank God for a prophet see because of a lot of answers he's given us that even the Heathen who know nothing about God when I read that I rejoiced to find out that God would not send that heathen whether it be you know in America or not send that heater into hell because he'd never heard the truth he'll be judged according the prophet said according to his own laws you just think about it sister Gail he's so great until those people back there that know nothing of him and yet he heals them he delivers them guides them takes care of them seemingly more than he does to us right because he's God and then being judged according to their deeds and talks and the way they live we'll be judged according to Salvation on the basis of eternal life because we have a group of people that we wouldn't teach us back in the organized religion we didn't know much about it called a foolish virgin Matthew 25. you got five wives five foolish the Five Wives had the Holy Ghost the five foolish didn't have it and they're going to be judged according to their own lives that's a wonderful God Amen I thank him every day for showing me is true that's right but the questions I once had are beginning to be answered you know and thoughts that I wondered and pondered about was why I titled this how does God predestinate the Bible says he does but then he tells us that he predestinates because those that He foreknew we read he predestinates well see then he forward knew everybody'd ever be in the world that's what I was trying to get across Wednesday about the mind of God he knows every person ever be in the world see we think that so many people was made to be saved so many people was made to be lost now could God be just and do that come on you can't do it so he doesn't have predestinate according to his desires even because see you take it as thinking of his desires I take it on the opposite direction in an answer to my heart he doesn't predestinate by his desires he said well his desires would that he choose certain people no I look at it that he predestinates not according to his desires because he desire that everybody be saved so then he would have to save everybody but he doesn't do it that way he could not display his attributes of healer savior Etc under those conditions right all right so he doesn't predestinate according to his desires he really predestinates according to what we desire amen he won't override we'll get to it this evening he will not override your free moral agency now on the message they're so revelated do you know what preachers a lot of them in the message three more agency is foolish virgins don't have nothing to do with me I'm predestinated eternally laughs you know that God will read in a minute or this evening we'll read that God even gave the devil of free moral agency he didn't make him the devil he made him the anointed church right right that's what your Bible says but see that's what I don't understand why we can't just go down simple about it and look at it God does a predestinate My Desire he's not willing that any should perish but by foreknowledge he knew who would accept him who would not this is what I like therefore he can make everything work according to his big time clock that's ticking away for he could foretell the end from the beginning what kind of a god do we serve amen well maybe God knows a little bit maybe well that means you know more than he does if you ain't got enough sense to figure that out I'll tell you when we think we can straighten God out that means we're God we're greater than he is if we can correct his errors that's what gets me about the people this message probably jumping on to the prophet they didn't do it while he was alive is afraid of that but now they're just running just if you straighten him out come on I need to kiss you big toe I'm playing on that you know what that means don't you that bow down to the pope and kiss this toe because he's God hmm do you straightened right around them out you need to get your toe kissed but just be careful around me you might get it hit with a hammer well because I don't believe you or I either one that won't straighten the word of God out if we can it's not God's word sorry for being plain but why not at least you know where I stand well I don't know what brother Dale believes there ain't nobody to tell you that I never heard anybody say I don't know what brother Dale believes they'll say I don't understand what he believes with them they know I don't told them we look at the number two about it what what do we think about it right around them on a message dedication 62. 11 11 morning service look what he's talking about David is constantly thinking of God back in the Psalms he writing too many of us today think of our achievements and something we could do or better ourselves but David was constantly thinking of what he could do for God now I hope it's Dawning on you what I've always preached to you God said your sacrifice and offerings has become a stink in my nostrils why because it was just a haphazard get it go to the lamb face the lamb for me make sure you write my name down I want a record that I you know give me a receipt where I can take it home when I made this offering but look what God would say I know your desires David and I want you to know what I've done for you he goes through to describing where he took him from said but your desires are correct David desired after God the Bible said he was a man after God's Own Heart now the notes that I gave you today is not the ones I'm using this morning so you won't find those quotes Okay you have to read that off the board some of them will be in there but no see God knew David's desires the Bible said an honest and a contrite heart is what God desires he ordained the offerings in the sacrifices he wasn't saying do away with him he just said it's become just a natural there's something to go do and to become a stink in his nostrils but a man after this a heart like David that he could get in the Psalms and sing and talk about God he said yeah but he was a murderer and everything else you know that was the time and that was before the New Birth was given so we don't get over here and start just going killing a bunch of people so it's all right but David was defending Israel I'm going to ordain for those people to be killed right he commissioned him to do it but think about it what kind of desires do you have just remember God will give you the desires of your heart see a lot of people that I could always tell you when I hit that point that you can just see people's minds when you're saying you know God's going to give us going to take this body and make it eternal and we'll be 18 years old and they're just going how beautiful I'll be well that's not exactly the way it's going to be you know what that kind of person won't be there because their desires in the wrong place go down and get your workout center and straighten it up that away if you want it but don't blame it on God listen Church what are our desires what do we desire because God works according to what you desire my brother Dale I've had these desires a long time God ain't fulfilled them yet well so what does that mean s God hadn't heard you he might be giving you a little time to figure out your desire we'll get to it in a minute if we have time don't we'll get to it this evening you see but we we were having to deal with the fact of God and being him being infinite and whatever thought he had in the beginning he can't change that so the first person was to be saved by the blood you agree so that means everybody should be saved by the blood the first person that was healed had to believe God how does God heal Us by believing him he doesn't change his mind so all we got to do is find that channel all right so it was by the blood then we go through the Old Testament by the blood then comes the blood of almighty God into being in Jesus Christ and we're saved by the blood we really kept saved by it and we're saved by grace through faith right that's according to the scripture but really kept saved by the blood but see thinking about serving a god whose thoughts are eternal amen so you're dealing with it for knowledge as his thoughts right right then he pre-determines the destiny is that predetermining because of his desires and his talk no it's because in his thought he knew exactly what we'd do amen the Bible says a thing for him can't say why did you form me this way because he didn't form us this way we formed ourselves we made ourselves sinners right because of the choices we made all right so then the thoughts of God are eternal he can never have a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have 149 Church age book thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real listen to a definition now they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has grown up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God all right if he thought of you being saved now here's what people look at you know well if he thought of me being saved I'm going to be saved but if he thought of me being lost I'm going to be lost now he thought of you thinking that right right right we ain't pulling nothing over on him he knew what we think if you know never that whatever bat his eye and then you mean to tell him he didn't know our thoughts well the Bible says think on these things we'll get down in a minute just the scripture look what he says and I'll give you this from before in Harvest Time number four any notes brother he's talking about how that Harvest Time 1964 12. paragraph 122 through 124. God is Not omnipresent except that he's omniscient right see we make him a spirit that is just ever were oh God is a being he says he sets in the heavens with his feet on Earth it was my Throne a nurse my footstool see we go back in there well it was a time that God was just a spirit that's her human terminologies but what else could we say God is not just like the wind that blows it's over here and it's over there that's what they say of the amoya that in Africa you know their Doctrine is a Moya I believe it's a word which means that you breathe in I breathe in brother Donnie breathes out I get his soul I breathe out he breathe in he gets mine oh my god sister spirit he said well the Bible says he's a spirit I pray with it I believe it but he's omnipresent in that he's omniscient he knows all things he knows to be there he doesn't have to be on the moon today there's nobody on the moon right as far as we know if there's anybody else died then he's up there as a witness right go back and study those first space travels and see if those astronauts didn't say and a lot followed him there and followed them back see maybe you don't read I like to read I don't believe everything I read all right but I do believe it when it fits right okay but see he desired that every person be saved therefore by his foreknowledge he can predestinate and make everything work to his glory to be a savior it would mean that he would have to have some way for someone to be lost you agree so God in the beginning before the world or anything when he was self-existing is he's the only word we can use is called Elohim which means self-existing and in that he had the attribute of being a father but there was nothing for him to be a father over all right now listen he had the attribute of being a god I use that because of the first stage coming this way was what to be God he made angels and they worshiped him that made him our word god because God means an object of worship but the angels had nothing to do with salvation other than working backwards and forth and helping you and I Minister unto that to The Heirs of salvation I believe that way that I believe we've got an angel that helps us and guide us and takes care of us and I sure work mine to death a lot of times you know hanging upside down off a deer stand building on things and Donnie's down on the ground said get down I'll do it you know but listen he had an attribute or a part of him that he desired to be a father we had no children but at the same time see if he only had that one attribute as being a father he could have created a family and that would have made him an attribute of father in the fact of creation with the same time he desired to be a healer one of course the scripture says by Stripes I'm Healed so he desired to be a Healer now to be a Healer meant somebody had to be sick to be a father he didn't have to make us lost he could have made us and we would have made him I called him father but that wouldn't have been the kind of father he wanted you know what the kind of father he wanted to be was one who would come and die for you and I you think all of that wasn't in his mind as he was before the world and all of the things see then it would be necessary that to be a fall but God can't make the fall and be just I'm quoting from the prophet right he can't be judged and make us fall how would he condemn us for being Fallen that wouldn't make him a savior or healer or anything foreign but he knew if he made us we'd fall take the Holy Spirit Away right now and you'll fall come on you don't believe that but that's all right I don't care so holy righteous I wouldn't fall take the spirit away and you will go right back to your own lust you tell me you won't I don't care how old you are amen you never stop thinking that's right there's no way to stop that thinking that's right and you're going to go right back but I thank God we're not going to fall again we're going to be changed why because he said it yeah and I believe it but now here's a scripture that kind of strikes us look what it says there what we read to start with go ahead and pull up a second Peter I want you to think about this scripture number five or for or therefore what for or whatever you know get this straight line it up the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure right well how'd I do it he either told me he didn't choose me well then you're not worried about your calling an election you ain't reading the scripture Peter says make sure in other words no calling well I know about the calling Bible says no man come to me unless your father draw him well has he drawed you just make sure make sure it wasn't mama that's why I'm against altar calls and the basis of begging people to come to the altar or come back to you and tell you you better get in the altar because you know you need to be saved you need I'm not going to do that that's overriding you're a free moral agency right that's overriding your choosing and I'll make you a twofold child of hell right it's going to be harder to get you back in church when I was little the Lord you can't kill me I'd letter the Lord to tell them brother now you just don't tell people you think I don't know what your thoughts are a lot of time that ain't even the Revelation that don't need discernment to do that I just know what we think about you know I know I called it them things a roll you know what I thought my drove who am I thinking right but make is a word meaning you have something to do with it right right if not you would take out that word make and you would just say you're calling an election assure Lord just don't worry about it eat drink and be merry you're either going to heaven or you're not look Peter says make you have something to do with this that's right make sure God has called you and not Mom and Daddy called you we talk about preachers that way right we talk about preachers that Mama called daddy sent the rest of them got up and went but make your calling make your calling sure and I heard this voice calling me okay okay but was it the voice of God that's it that's right the voice of God don't call us to error well I did a voices spoke to me and said that that Trinity is correct I can just see a father here and a holy ghost over here and a son over here and a voice told me that was right yeah I don't doubt it don't say that right when that show me that in the word because in the word there's one true and living God see we think we know all about it like I always say we say oh I heard the voice of God it was so sweet it told me that it didn't matter what I'd done I could wear any clothes I wanted to and act any way I wanted to because I'm saved anyway thank you people hear voices but the voice of God is sweet now it is the voice of God is sweet have you ever heard him say sit down shut up you're going wrong you keep going that away and you're lost you ain't never heard him say that he maybe he talks sweet to you but according to my Bible God loves to chasten us to try us to see whether or not we are his children he doesn't want to just well you're so sweet I just love you so much go ahead and just live like you want to it don't make no difference now that's not the voice of God I don't care what you say and I don't care if you tell me the Dead's raised to prove that's right I'll still argue with you because that's not the word of God when my Bible says if a prophet take you to another God don't believe him no matter what time he has make your calling an election sure no make your calling sure was it the voice of God that called you now then make your election sure right now the only way I know to make anything sure is to know how it works maybe that's carnal but that's the best way I've done it uh you know brother-in-law Peggy's brother he runs a machine shop you know and he's a and what you call it a drawer you know you know and all of them things you know Richard used to work for him well that boy wouldn't it be something me going there and it's in that jury I want to tell you you draw down that little thing that you had to her and you put out but that won't work in each side but but according to what we've learned is supposed to work I said no no that's not the way you do it well I'd sure prove to be a dummy wouldn't I wouldn't it be nice to talk to Einstein until Einstein I know all about electricity we got one sitting right back there it's been to school all of his life to learn electricity and he can't still can't tell me where the electricity runs on that wire or in that wire right foreign you can't do it if it runs away we think you could plug it into anything that'd work but it's got to have a ground the ground is more important than the positive right why do you put a double ground anything you don't put double electricity to it right do you understand what I'm saying yes we think in our peanut brain waves we can tell God how to do things well what you would have done in the beginning you should have done it this way but make your calling an election sure think about that in other words understand your calling okay I'm called of God God called but now uh the next one is Matthew 24 4 22 14. it says many are called but few are chosen right so now do you know which way you're seeing many are called you can be called of God and it's still not be right and few are chosen well because God knows what what you believe and what you want so make your calling correct make sure you know about your calling okay and that's still in foreknowledge amen now and your election well now brother Dale recording what I believe about election election is just reaching over and getting this one and getting that one and getting this one and getting that one and leave all in between is not to be because I elected that um you're gonna have trouble at the polls when they start trying to figure out who's going to be president because the election is going to take a long time before you can do that picking you understand what I mean it's going to take a long time for everybody to blabber about what they're going to do when they know they can't do it when they get in office right that's election no brother Dale that's natural election well that's what I'm trying to show you you don't know what election is the Bible said elect according to the foreknowledge of God right now come on to my quote in the Bible elect according to foreknowledge so then election is based on foreknowledge right see now we're seeing everything everything in life from the day one or the starting or whatever it was to the end of all of this is based upon God's foreknowledge you said well brother Dale you know we got up we come to church today you made a choice right you could have chose to stay at home and probably right now you're saying I wish I had but that's all right but listen do you believe it this way see this is the way I believe in election for knowledge predestination the mind of God uh for ordained for new for no Ford Nation is because God foreknew and could predestinate according to his foreknowledge but do you believe that everybody in the world today could be saved if they desired it um seven billion of us right that's just talking about in our generation do you believe that way I I just go with this certain election is his choosing well the Bible says choose you right this day whom you will serve but brother Dale you don't understand I've got those notes laying on the table so don't worry about it I'll go ahead and office but the Bible said we were chosen in him before the foundation world remember the line chosen in him before the foundation of the world got to fall on this side of that line the same as foreknowledge predestination be determined cruising election it's got to be his foreknowledge if not you are saying that God chose me but but but I got the quotes come on quote yourself to death I didn't choose him God chose me why did he choose you if he didn't choose you because of the foreknowledge of what you watch your person no problem so we draw a line from that line for knowledge is predestination mind of God desires Lounge Book of Life written before the foundation of the world all the things has got to fall onto this for knowledge side but my brother so-and-so preaches it and he he makes me feel like that I was just back there so does Napoleon everybody maybe not understand that space on the internet you might not Napoleon thought he was pre-existent from some other world right people who say I just feel I just feel the knives up in heaven What Do You Feel It by all the difference to your box all over me go get me some ice I'll drop it down your back and we're going to see about your chill bumps you say you're silly you you make fun no I don't make fun I don't make fun of God's word I believe in killbox I believe in the movie no God yes I've smelled him I've seen him I've done everything so don't make fun of me and say that I'm making fun of God's word I'm just telling it like it is you shout your shoe healed off and still be lost but you can't be born again and be lost if you're born again you are going to have feelings all right I love them little babies that just wiggle and kick and moving oh it is I used to get some tickled I'd get next to my wife when she's carrying the babies I'd get close to her where I could feel that baby kicking she said yeah but you don't feel what's inside it might be true but you know one day I was able to feed what was outside I I don't like to see a baby to just lay back you fattened them too much take a little food away right fat and a horse and what good is it starving a little bit and he'll go to work that's the way God does God don't fatten you and I all over at one time he gives us a little bit at your time just enough to make it to the next meal and you know what Brother Gary sometimes how long is that about three to six months to the next meal I told him something the other day he said it'll take you years to preach it I saw creepy because it made me years before he speaks to me again how would you like to be a preacher and get up here and say you know I sure hope is what he wanted me to say but listen Church do you believe everybody in the world could be saved if you don't then your God is no infinite God your God is a your makeup of your own mind and your thinking because he wouldn't all be saved but in you some would not be saved but you know why is it that if that's not true why is it that you can go to a country you can go to we used to say Africa all the time because that just meant a continent you know you can go to Alaska and you go to anywhere go back into places where they've never heard the name of Jesus nobody's never spoken to them about God and you find them worshiping a totem pole you explain it you explain that those people are worshiping an animal and God comes down and heals them you've got to agree with that right if there's any here it's the faith of that individual in believing God you didn't listen while ago when I said that even the Heathen would be judged by his own living by his rules of his life and can go to heaven because he's a good person well yet he's a cannibal yeah he eats people so what see that's where we don't want those times look look at the next quote I've tried my best for years to get us to see this and I know that it goes contrary to the grain of organized religion on predestination and the people of this message on predestination and I don't I'm not just saying I'm in the middle and I got it I'm just saying is it a truth look at the number quote number seven taken from why Christ speaks 63 7 14 the morning service paragraph 29 30 31. many times when we take when we look at the scripture in our own way of looking it seems to be very hard but if we study it a little bit we find out that the all-wise God knows just what he's doing and he knows how to do these things and how to deal with man he knows what's in man he knows him we don't we only know from the intellectual side he knows from he knows what's really in the man Moses was born in this world and a gifted boy you agree with that he was to be the deliverer of the Israel right amen all right now he wasn't to deliver it when he's first born right but what was it he was born A Gifted boy he was born to be a prophet a deliverer he was born with the equipment born in him as ever man that comes into the world is born with this equipment as I firmly believe in the foreknowledge of God the predestination no no no yeah and we'll get on to it later he's not meaning that bodies born to be a prophet is he because you would have a world full of prophets what is he saying that that hot and tot back in Africa that knows nothing about God yet he cries before and worships an idol and believes that that God can speak to him and God comes down and heals him and delivers him and saves him and keeps him right yeah but I've never thought about God the way you think about him well maybe that's maybe that's why you need to change your thinking about your God I'm sorry I'm just honest I believe that that person that knows nothing about God can be healed and not even believing in Jesus Christ as the Healer you know what I mean believing in it and the basis of knowing anything about it he enters a law by faith to believe and God drops down and heals him now he actually going to explain it see then everybody is born because of it being a human being a creation we're born to worship God Born To Worship born to serve God the desire after God that's why I was reading about David said David I know your desires you're rotten stinking murderer you're an adulteress you're all kind of thing I know you desire you desire to serve me you want to build me a house but I'm not going to let you but you know what David David didn't get mad bless God Gorgeous I'll tell you what he he just told me that that he wasn't gonna let me build it so I'm just gonna forget it now he'd approve then just there's something wrong with him right so what did David start doing you know when Solomon got ready to build a temple he didn't have to send after nothing reads your Bible David set out immediately to bring it in the things to build the temple he just wasn't able to put him together Solomon didn't have to call for this and sure he did because they needed but you get the point most of the things were laying on the ground that David provided now what did I tell you it said uh brother Marlow you can't build me a house it's okay I ain't gonna try but would that be a brother or a Christian no you'd say well okay let me start getting together the things that you're going to need that's what God was looking at that man loved God he sung in them songs in the first person amen they pierced my hands and my feet sung like he was hanging on the cross because of his desires but everybody's born with this equipment right not that God is willing that any would perish but all might come to repentance but being God he had to know and he does know the end from the beginning see if he doesn't then he isn't infinite and if he is not infinite he isn't God so he was willing so he wasn't willing certainly that any should perish but he he know knowing who would perish and who would not perish that's the reason the very purpose that Jesus came to the Earth was to save those that God through his foreknowledge seemed that wanted to be saved see because the whole world would be condemned and I don't see how we could teach any other way than the foreknowledge argue with your prophet of God and the Bible plainly saying that he knows the end from the beginning and can tell it I don't see how you can do it any other way he says of course what do you mean I got these other quotes I quoted it one ago first Peter one and two elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ unto you in peace be multiplied elect according to foreknowledge let me read these facts because he won't be able to keep up with me no can't do it number nine he chooses which is trying to do God a service and just in case out there on internet that you want things after the seals broke basically all of these quotes the days after the sealed broke you say well what are you saying that because there are people it says brother Ryan was wrong before the seals broke and right after they broke I don't believe that those things he didn't see before the sealed broke yes but he saw a wonderful and living God and God come down and Vindicated it he chooses his own person that's four knowledge like he said in Romans 8 here Esau that the election of God might stand the election of God might stand Esau and Jacob was born both of holy parents twins that his election might stand sure and true he said I hate Esau and love Jacob before either boy was born he knows what's in man he knows it from noted from the beginning what it was therefore he can make everything work just exactly on plot of time we get all nervous and frustrated you never seen him flustrated you know everything's working just right see he knew exactly what Jacob would want and he knew exactly what he saw would want by his four knowledge see that's the problem with people with their predestination Doctrine they said well then if he noted ain't nothing we can do about it see that's where you're blind he noted it by his foreknowledge he looked down through and seen what Jacob would do and seeing what Esau would do and he could write it down before right simple to me I know I'm illiterate dumb stupid and everything in the book with that simple to me that God don't choose by his desires he chooses by his foreknowledge that he looks down and sees gonna be Joe Jacob and rejected Esau without it being by foreknowledge of what they would do he's a respecter person that's right election let's just hit one or two a sign of this time 63 11. 13. it's just the church chose Matthias but God chose fall see that's the difference God always does his choosing his election he does that by election by foreknowledge he does it by his foreknowledge then he's saying that's his election he elects my foreknowledge that's the next one 1960 it is I paragraphs Eve 55. and how many believes in foreknowledge of God that he foreknowledge and election is by for knowledge election is by foreign 58 316 door to the heart he's not willing but his foreknowledge lets him know and his election might stand right above her you don't say I'm going to say this one and lose that one he wants you all saved but his foreknowledge no who would so therefore he could predestinate according to foreknowledge in that selection so when I don't make the election go back past four knowledge right read this unto you many times of the message adoption 1965-15 listen predestination looks back to foreknowledge I mean election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to Destiny now here's one of the people message really don't like but he's the one that said it and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that an election looks back here I was a kookaburra don't you tell me I was a kookaburra I always was a seed of God you ain't never heard that preached wake up always was eternal I guess this quote's wrong let's turn this down throw it away right don't forget that election looks back here here it is I was a kookaburra I was born in sin shaping an iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among Sinners father and mother and all my whole family sinners I was a kookaburra but all of a sudden I became a quick train how did it happen uh that what is that election God before the foundation of the world elected that to kookaburra was to become a grain of wheat you just don't understand brother Tale we just was this great once now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved how do I do it look back and see that he predestinated long time ago by foreknowledge he seen that I would love him so he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him I might become from a couple bird to a grain of wheat now where am I at now I'm saved I'm walking in the grace of God what does predestination look to this destiny where will he take me to and where am I going you see you say but I I wouldn't know don't tell me I serpent seed will you tell me what she was I always was a seed of God go ahead and read a few message in Israel if he gets them up face that's fine but you're saved by grace election God's foreknowledge predestination for the nation all time together message God's covenant with Abraham now that's brings us down to election now now God by for knowledge could set election by foreknowledge he could set election therefore Abraham when he's called who was he carrying Idol is worse than either God's covenant with Abraham and his seed but now Abraham was called of God by election or foreknowledge knowing that Abraham would walk before God listen knowing that Abraham would walk before God and that's the only reason tonight but the same way it's the only reason In You and I a second-handed robe 56 11 25. we cannot make one Higher black or one white neither can we add one thing to our statute by taking talk but God in his infinite grace and by his election and his foreknowledge set those things in order and every will works exactly right I like that I would be a discouraged man this morning if I didn't believe in the election and calling of God Abraham election God calls Man by election for knowledge that's Abraham's Abraham which is 56. I love this part that Christianity has no negative nothing to it ain't nothing negative in Christianity Jehovah Jireh God called Abraham not because he was Abraham God called Abraham by election Abraham was no good man no better than nobody else he probably come out of it you go drop down but I want you to get it God by foreknowledge called and elected Abraham he knew his heart he knew from the foundation of the world and Abraham only fit into God's program looked Elisha Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 book 1. brother not long ago before the world was ever had a foundation do it God through his eternal Grace he looked down and by foreknowledge he's seen you and I he knew what age we live in he knew what we would be therefore by election he could choose us before the foundation of the world to be with him without spot hmm think about it put up the lights when brother Joan will go you remember last Sunday or Wednesday when I was talking about that God was so infinite that he knew that Richard Marlowe would marry Charlotte how many kids that would have how many grandkids over the house and all that do you believe it but you see I believe God is infinite I believe God knows if Richard had not a married Charlotte and married you know somebody else and how many kids they would have had no no I don't believe that now I just believe in full knowledge before knowledge he knew he was married but he knew what would happen if he didn't now you want scripture was your after the service he said let me give you a scripture look Exodus 13 17 18. and it came to price when Pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near in other words a shorter route for God said pre-adventure last pre-admission the people repent when they see the war and they return to Egypt he knew if they went this way but he also knew what they'd do if he went this way what kind of a god do you serve I'm sorry what kind of a god do you serve but God led to people about to the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea because he knew if he took him any other way they mess up he knew what to do well I only just believe brother there you finally got me down to believing in foreknowledge okay hang on don't lose it you see God knows but we don't he knows why you you ever been going one way and something tell you to turn and go another way come find out there was a wreck there or something went wrong or whatever I said well you sure got an odd way of explaining God I love him anyway I love him anyway I just try to explain to you what he is to me you're going to put your own limitations upon God and make him not know I'm trying to put it to work that your thoughts would be that in his foreknowledge he knew exactly what would be and he could predestinate accordingly but he knew whether or not you'd choose him so he said to you choose you not I chose choose you this day whom you will serve he's looking at our choice he's looking at our desires to be saved and he's got it ready for us what greater thought would you want than to know that we have eternal life today because before the world God knew we'd want it and he'd have it ready let's stand we won't even have the musicians come we're just saying I love him if anybody wants to call just five minutes till 12. anybody needs healing salvation or something I'll be here with you and pray the rest of the day but that's you know we get people tired and I'm sorry I went a little empty but take on these things make your calling an election sure make sure you know what you're talking about don't just take somebody's idea well brother so-and-so said if he's in the truth he's got the truth or not he's a liar and what it don't mean no difference who the liar is right that's right here and one day last week it's not come up with my elbow just gonna agree we're gonna pray for our brother he's got to run goes out of tests made tomorrow you've got to knock come up on his arm and things we're going to believe everything's gonna be all right because we believe it oh yeah and see prior then can change it you know how it can change he can take away this or not we don't argue then not star we don't argue we're sick I got a complete physical tomorrow when I walk in there I say you're not going to say how you doing so much I'm doing wonderful if everybody was feeling as good as I am you'd be out of business he likes he said okay what's your problem I said I got a bad cold give me something for it why because I believe in doctors and helps and uh when I tell him in a hurry you ain't a Healer thank you for helping me so we believe that brother Ray when he goes tomorrow that's all going to be all right not because God's word says we can ask it father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands on our brother believing that tomorrow when he gets tired the report's going to be made and all is well father we love you in Jesus name anybody else ah hey look keep these quotes that I gave you this morning you know to those that are not here if you would put out a copy of them for them because that way you'll have a lot of the quotes about predestination to see what the prophet of God is saying awful knowledge you're dismissed mother just blessed people as we dismiss have your way with each and every one of us in Jesus name amen come morning I walk by the river
