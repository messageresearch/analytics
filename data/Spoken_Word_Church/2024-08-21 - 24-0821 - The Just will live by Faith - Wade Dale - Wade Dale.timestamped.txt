[6:13] the brothers for doing an absolute
[6:14] wonderful job this weekend good to have
[6:18] a a group of ministers that you can
[6:20] depend on and and uh and know that they
[6:24] know the word of God and they know how
[6:25] to they know how to bring it so we
[6:28] appreciate brother Lis and brother Aaron
[6:29] and and brother Bob for what they did
[6:31] this weekend while we were gone we had a
[6:33] real good time at Brother Richard
[6:34] Wilson's it's good to get back in
[6:36] fellowship with them he's a uh a
[6:39] wonderful brother in the Lord and we've
[6:42] always enjoyed his fellowship and his
[6:44] son Steven's coming here the end of
[6:48] September um uh the last weekend of
[6:50] September so he'll be here with us for
[6:53] that uh that weekend so good to be back
[6:57] if you got your Bibles turn to the Book
[6:58] of Job I don't know why we're going to
[7:00] do job job it just come up this way no
[7:03] what I was thinking about the other day
[7:05] we were we started on the isua street or
[7:08] or the uh Pentecostal Holy Ghost falling
[7:11] on the day of Pentecost in
[7:14] 1906 but I kept going back that week and
[7:17] and praying about what to speak at uh at
[7:21] brother Richards and then this thought
[7:22] came on my heart this is we're going to
[7:25] talk about
[7:26] justification but we're going to make
[7:28] sure that
[7:30] we remember that justification is not it
[7:33] is a one act it is a
[7:37] one um God's going to forgive you of of
[7:40] your sins and then you have the sins
[7:42] again and then you have sanctification
[7:44] then you have the baptism of the Holy
[7:46] Ghost but if we can't believe that all
[7:48] of our
[7:49] sins all of our sins are
[7:53] forgiven then we got a
[7:55] problem amen and we sin every day so
[7:58] there's the par brother R said we sin
[8:00] every day because we're born in sin amen
[8:03] we can't help that adamic nature being
[8:05] attached to our
[8:08] spirit but out of our
[8:10] soul gone just as just as God is so
[8:16] we're going to speak tonight on the just
[8:19] not
[8:20] shall the just will live right by faith
[8:24] we're a faith group of people we believe
[8:26] things we can't see we believe things
[8:29] we've ever seen in our life which would
[8:31] been the day of calvary or the day of
[8:33] the Resurrection we were not there
[8:34] personally to look at it with our eyes
[8:36] but we were there with him and so we are
[8:39] identified when we receive the new birth
[8:41] you're identified with that you're
[8:43] identified with hanging on the cross cuz
[8:46] he thought of you while he was there he
[8:47] died for you and me he didn't die for
[8:49] himself that's right he died for us amen
[8:53] so that he could be the
[8:56] justifier there's got to come to a point
[8:58] that has to be one one righteous judge
[9:00] and we'll read that last scripture we
[9:02] read tonight Paul he's coming to the end
[9:05] of his
[9:06] road and he said Jesus Christ the
[9:09] righteous
[9:10] judg what a mighty God we serve let's
[9:13] bow our heads dear heavenly father thank

[9:35] wanted us to make a special prayer
[9:37] through sister Joyce Lord I pray that
[9:38] you'd bless it that situation Lord and
[9:41] you're the only one that can do that
[9:43] Lord you're the only one that can take

[9:54] cousin Tina Crocker her daughter comes

[10:08] that the great physician will take over
[10:11] and that you'll F that you know exactly
[10:13] before the foundation of the world what
[10:14] was wrong with her and I pray Lord that

[10:21] attention so that they can maybe give
[10:23] her some medication or something Lord

[10:48] let's let's read let me tell you
[10:50] something um I've been reading on Smith
[10:52] Wigglesworth because I've been speak um
[10:55] speaking to myself been preaching myself
[10:57] a
[10:57] sermon of Theus Street Pentecost how
[11:00] that started we always say isusa Street
[11:03] 1906 and then we just kind of leave it
[11:05] there my what a powerful thing it was I
[11:09] mean it struck the world in the the the
[11:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost struck the
[11:13] world people would walk into church and
[11:15] two minutes later they said would be
[11:17] slain in the spirit just walking in
[11:19] because they come off the street there
[11:20] was so much power in that church where
[11:23] is that power now it should be greater
[11:25] now amen should be greater now than it
[11:28] was then
[11:30] and let's see where it comes from SMI
[11:31] Smith Wigglesworth said the Bible is the
[11:34] word of
[11:35] God Supernatural in
[11:38] origin Eternal in
[11:41] duration inexpressible in Valor infinite
[11:45] in
[11:46] scope regenerative in power infallible
[11:51] in
[11:51] Authority Universal in interest personal
[11:56] in application inspired in totality ity
[12:00] whole words inspired read it through
[12:03] write it down pray it in work it out
[12:06] then pass it on Amen so we're going to
[12:10] read it right now job 25 now brother
[12:12] Bob's been
[12:14] speaking out of the Book of Job and
[12:16] let's look now we're going to look today
[12:20] and and we're going to see that this may
[12:22] take us down a little different path
[12:24] than you may be thinking
[12:25] now so job is looking remember is
[12:29] looking for a redeemer he's looking he
[12:31] he's looking for answers to the
[12:32] questions is why why are my children
[12:34] gone why why I'm on a as sheep why why
[12:37] is my wife turned against me why he's
[12:39] asking these questions and here's one
[12:41] question he says how then can man be
[12:44] justified with God now remember when we
[12:46] get to the end of the book we
[12:50] are rightl we are but with his
[12:54] Revelation at the time in the Old
[12:56] Testament he's made all the sacrifices
[12:58] he's everything he's supposed to do cuz
[13:01] remember you will you were not ever
[13:03] justified in the sight of God in the Old
[13:06] Testament right you were
[13:08] covered all right you were covered to
[13:10] Calvary and then that took care of it
[13:12] but at the moment in time job is saying
[13:15] how then can man be justified with God
[13:18] or how can he be clean that is
[13:22] born of a woman every one of
[13:26] us have been born of a woman the brother
[13:29] B said born between Satan and Eve so job
[13:32] asked a question how then can man be
[13:35] justified with
[13:36] God because remember Justified means
[13:39] what
[13:41] righteous that means you're just you're
[13:44] just as righteous as God is if you've
[13:46] been Justified job couldn't find that
[13:49] now he found his Redeemer he found the
[13:52] person that was going to do it for him
[13:54] but he never came to that justification
[13:56] but you and I can you and I don't have
[13:58] to ask question anymore I know how I can
[14:01] be justified with God I know that my
[14:04] first first birth did not make me clean
[14:07] only my second birth is what made me
[14:09] clean all right we're going to read
[14:10] habca 2 and then we'll sit down for the
[14:13] vision is yet for an appointed time now
[14:15] remember there was a there's a vision
[14:18] and you and I have got to get a hold of
[14:21] that vision and then make it real
[14:23] because if there was a vision as we
[14:25] preached many years ago in Jamaica
[14:26] brother R had a vision of of people
[14:28] going up and down the mountain and a
[14:30] vision of Jamaica on fire and all these
[14:32] different things and I preached a sermon
[14:34] I told him I said you got to get into
[14:36] that Vision amen you were seen of a
[14:39] prophet there were people seen of a
[14:41] prophet doing these things I said you
[14:43] got to get into it and make it manifest
[14:45] cuz if he saw it and it come from the
[14:47] mind of God it has to come to
[14:50] pass so we have been given a vision
[14:54] Beyond any Vision anybody's ever been
[14:56] given brother random went all the way
[14:59] way to the past the curtain of time into
[15:00] the curtain of time and went all the way
[15:02] into the future home in a vision but now
[15:06] we got to fulfill those parts of those
[15:08] Visions so for the vision is yet for an
[15:11] appointed time so we have an vision for
[15:13] an appointed time today but at the end
[15:16] watch it shall
[15:20] speak by thy words you'll be justified
[15:24] and by your words you'll be
[15:26] condemned but at the end it shall speak
[15:28] and not like
[15:30] though it t wait for it my habca it's
[15:34] been like 4,800 years since habca spoke
[15:37] this we're taring for it amen hallelujah
[15:41] because it will surely
[15:42] come it will not t we might have to tear
[15:45] but it won't then the summation of that
[15:48] is behold his soul which is lifted up is
[15:51] not upright in
[15:53] him how many people have you seen try to
[15:57] justify their s
[15:59] amen don't ever try to justify yourself
[16:01] because you cannot do it there is no way
[16:03] in the world you can justify yourself
[16:06] but the just shall live look by his
[16:11] faith you may be seated in the Lord add
[16:13] His blessings to the reading of the word
[16:15] now we're going to get into something
[16:17] here that may be a little different than
[16:18] what you what you saw brother uh Bob
[16:21] touched on it not too long ago on the
[16:23] seals about the mystery of iniquity but
[16:25] we're going to talk about it right here
[16:27] look at go to Romans 3:23
[16:29] three and watch now Paul Paul is now
[16:33] he's on the other end of Joel I mean Joe
[16:37] job's over here said look how can a man
[16:39] be justified how can a man is born of a
[16:40] woman be clean Romans 3 Paul say the
[16:43] same thing for what all have
[16:46] sinned all let's say all together all
[16:51] have sinned and come short of the glory
[16:52] of God so there's nobody that came this
[16:54] way and others come this way hello
[16:57] somebody
[16:59] all right only in the mind of God was
[17:00] there a group of people that made it up
[17:02] here than down here Genesis 126 man it
[17:06] is that man is different but God saw it
[17:09] would be different because we were in
[17:10] the mind of God and we received it down
[17:12] here and he knew that people like Adolf
[17:14] Hitler and different ones wouldn't break
[17:15] wouldn't make it right but we've all got
[17:17] to come the same way we've all got to
[17:19] come born in sin we all got to come
[17:21] shaped in iniquity we all have here that
[17:23] we come here speaking lies Paul says for
[17:26] all have sinned and come short
[17:30] this is Paul a prophet a church age
[17:34] messenger he includes himself in that
[17:37] for all have sinned and come short of
[17:38] the glory of God now being justified
[17:41] freely by his grace through the
[17:44] Redemption that is in who Paul no Christ
[17:50] Jesus whom God has set forth to be a
[17:53] perpetuation through what here we go
[17:55] again the just shall live by faith no
[17:59] the just will live by faith if we're
[18:01] going to make it out of here we got to
[18:03] have faith for a body change we got to
[18:06] have faith for
[18:08] Rapture and it's a different kind of
[18:11] faith I'm telling
[18:12] you remember brother R I read you many
[18:15] times he said faith alone won't do
[18:18] it cuz we got to put that faith into
[18:20] action we got to put that faith into
[18:23] Works whom God has set forth to be a
[18:26] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[18:29] sorry brother Louise to declare his
[18:32] righteousness not
[18:34] yours his righteousness for the
[18:36] remission of sins that are passed I read
[18:38] this not too long ago remember you
[18:40] cannot be forgiven for sins that you
[18:42] haven't done
[18:44] yet don't ask forgiveness for something
[18:46] you're going to do tomorrow no you got
[18:48] to wait till tomorrow if not you're a
[18:50] Catholicism that's what they do that's
[18:52] what the that's what the mob does they
[18:53] say I'm going to kill 14 people tomorrow
[18:55] and they say okay say 14 hell marriage
[18:57] and give me $25,000
[18:59] and you're absolved well that's not the
[19:01] way God works you only forget listen
[19:04] Grace is not for the
[19:06] future Grace is for your
[19:09] past don't get quiet on me Grace is for
[19:12] your past it is not for your future
[19:16] right the remission of sins are for your
[19:20] past because
[19:22] remember
[19:24] tomorrow we're going to
[19:26] sin according to the word of God
[19:30] tomorrow you're going to
[19:31] sin you're going to wake up depending on
[19:34] eating you're going to wake up
[19:35] somebody's going to cut you off in the
[19:36] road
[19:38] you your boss is going to be a little
[19:40] bit mean to you your wife's going to say
[19:42] something a little sideways have I hit
[19:44] anybody yet okay thank you brother boy
[19:47] maybe all them other ones are perfect so
[19:50] through through the forbearance of God
[19:52] so God is longsuffering he he knows
[19:54] we're going to do this he knows every
[19:56] move we're going to make everything
[19:57] we've already done and everything that
[19:59] we're going to do he already knows that
[20:01] but he's all but we have to remember
[20:03] that he is all sufficient with a plan
[20:06] before we got here knowing what we would
[20:08] do he had something there a provision to
[20:11] get us out
[20:16] right slow down yes
[20:20] okay now watch what Paul
[20:23] says to declare I say at this time his
[20:28] righteousness listen folks we got to
[20:30] find his righteousness first I know this
[20:31] is Elementary but it's getting somewhere
[20:34] but we got to find his righteousness
[20:36] don't look at yours don't look at your
[20:39] neighbors you look at his
[20:41] righteousness he says we're perfect amen
[20:44] he says we've already made it he says
[20:48] we're The Virtuous sinless bride of
[20:50] Jesus Christ he said we're without spot
[20:53] and without wrinkle he's already said
[20:55] that that's right when are we going to
[20:57] connect to that and believe it come on
[20:59] amen that's what I said believe you're
[21:01] going to have faith you will have faith
[21:04] and you will live by faith because right
[21:07] now at the point you're standing today I
[21:10] know what's running through some of
[21:11] you's mind and mine too I did this
[21:13] yesterday I did this a day before I did
[21:16] this yet last week if you're not nodding
[21:18] your head then pray for me um brother
[21:20] John pray for me okay okay brother pray
[21:23] for you too good to see you
[21:26] buddy so whose righteousness are we
[21:28] going to declare ours his all right now
[21:33] under baby form and when we first get
[21:35] Justified you've got to believe that the
[21:38] righteousness of God is what takes your
[21:40] sins away right amen and puts them
[21:43] somewhere he can't even find him
[21:45] himself you got to believe that if not
[21:48] you're not justified right you got to
[21:52] really believe that
[21:54] am now
[21:56] watch to declare I say it this time his
[22:00] righteousness that he might be just well
[22:02] we know he
[22:03] is and the justifier you got to have a
[22:08] justifier you got to have a judge s
[22:10] sitting on the bench cuz you if you if
[22:13] you let the defense run the court
[22:15] they're always going to
[22:17] win right if you let the prosecution run
[22:20] the court they're always going to win
[22:22] you got to have a judge standing in the
[22:24] middle to judge right from wrong and
[22:28] remember God doesn't need counsel maybe
[22:30] some judges need counsel or or judges
[22:33] down here need books or they need
[22:35] previous laws or previous ways this was
[22:38] this was um uh this case was handled but
[22:41] God doesn't need that right he's a
[22:43] righteous judge so that means he does
[22:47] things
[22:48] right and he's the justifier of him now
[22:52] watch which believeth in
[22:56] Jesus too simple but he's the justifier
[23:00] of him which believeth in Jesus all
[23:04] right Paul where is boasting then it's
[23:07] excluded you can't boast you can't say I
[23:10] didn't do it because you know you did
[23:13] but the righteous judge can take and he
[23:15] can he can wipe your record
[23:17] off
[23:19] amen by what law of Works nope but by
[23:24] the law Here We Go Again by The Law of
[23:27] faith
[23:28] the just will live by faith therefore
[23:33] here's Paul he brings it all together
[23:35] therefore we
[23:38] conclude Paul's preaching that a man is
[23:41] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[23:45] the law am amen praise God because the
[23:49] law condemns you every time that's what
[23:51] condemns us now what takes us to court
[23:53] now if we if we have to go to court what
[23:55] takes us to court you did something
[23:56] wrong they not going to call me tomorrow
[23:59] at 8:00 in the morning and bring me to
[24:00] court for for a a driving violation and
[24:04] I ain't even got my car
[24:05] yet the only time you get in the
[24:07] courtroom is when you've done something
[24:10] or you got to be a
[24:12] witness so we are justified by faith
[24:15] without the Deeds of the
[24:17] law now I was thinking this is where
[24:20] we're going to kind of switch gears a
[24:22] little bit and go on what brother Bob
[24:24] was talking about the other day a couple
[24:25] weeks ago maybe let's turn to Revelation
[24:27] 6 ver1 one now we
[24:30] know we know that when we come to a
[24:34] realization that we're
[24:35] lost and we ask God to forgive us
[24:38] there's a point there to where God
[24:41] forgives you your sins but it doesn't
[24:43] take away the one that made you sin
[24:46] everybody with me but now there is a
[24:49] time and a place where we're to be
[24:54] justified by the statute of perfect man
[24:57] amen that it Works into your spirit
[24:59] realm and your memory reason conscious
[25:01] effects and Imagination what did Paul
[25:03] say do cast out
[25:05] reasoning cast
[25:07] out all right cuz see when we get to
[25:10] Luke you you in justif in sanctification
[25:13] the unclean Spirit goes out that's
[25:14] exactly right he's talking about your
[25:17] soul but when that Soul's sealed in
[25:19] God's going to start working on the
[25:21] outside guy so then that same set of
[25:24] demons is going to bombard your spirit
[25:27] realm cuz they can't get in in your soul
[25:29] Satan can't get in your soul cuz look
[25:31] Satan can't go anywhere there's
[25:35] eternity amen amen he cannot he cannot
[25:39] get in anywhere that's Eternal that's
[25:42] his problem that's what he wants to
[25:44] do he wants to be above God he wants to
[25:48] be over here do you know he was
[25:51] perfect God made him
[25:54] perfect amen that's right amen God made
[25:58] him without
[26:00] sin that's right come
[26:02] on he said I've made you perfect until
[26:07] what iniquity was found in your
[26:11] heart he knew what Satan would do but
[26:14] Satan couldn't help
[26:19] himself let's read this right here now
[26:22] we
[26:24] know we're looking here at the mystery
[26:26] of iniquity but let's remember that the
[26:30] first seal also shows one God now to see
[26:34] that you've got to see the mystery of
[26:36] iniquity you got to see where that
[26:37] iniquity is at everybody with me that's
[26:41] why brother R could say here stands a
[26:43] lamb with a book in his hand all right
[26:45] Revelation 61 and I saw when the lamb
[26:46] and opened one of the seals and I heard
[26:49] as were the noise of Thunder one of the
[26:50] four beasts now we know which one did
[26:52] that it was a lion l i o n so there was
[26:54] a Ministry loosed in the first three
[26:56] Church ages we've already been through
[26:58] do this but just a background just a
[27:00] minute I want you to see something there
[27:01] was a Ministry loosed first
[27:05] because the lion brother randam had the
[27:08] book who had the
[27:10] book The Lamb had the
[27:12] book the perfect one had the book The
[27:16] Righteous one had the book The Righteous
[27:19] judge had the
[27:21] book and when he had the book and then
[27:25] the the the voice was transferred to
[27:27] John come on
[27:30] somebody The Voice the Thunder is the
[27:32] voice of God when that voice come and
[27:35] said John come and
[27:38] see and watch and I
[27:42] saw that's a very short part but that's
[27:45] very
[27:47] profound and I saw when I had a
[27:50] revelation of where that sucker was at
[27:53] right amen he had to ride away from me
[27:57] because there stood the justif fire
[27:59] right there in the Pulpit that night
[28:01] brother R said here stands a lamb does
[28:03] John not type the
[28:05] bride John tyed the bride right here
[28:09] too and I
[28:11] saw can we change that just a little bit
[28:14] and when I
[28:15] believe when I got
[28:18] revelation behold a white horse what
[28:22] another
[28:24] Spirit right that's right another Spirit
[28:27] remember remember there's no iniquity in
[28:30] God Satan had iniquity in him so there's
[28:33] no iniquity in God so if you say
[28:35] iniquity you know where it's
[28:38] at right and if you're so full of
[28:43] God Satan's got to leave you right
[28:46] that's what we've got to work on when we
[28:47] get to the seals coming up in just just
[28:50] a little while when we get in Pastor zza
[28:52] Street and get into where brother
[28:53] Brandon brings his message we're going
[28:55] to see that he was standing there now
[28:58] you're going to swallow a minute brother
[29:00] randam stood there that night
[29:06] Justified before God or he wouldn't have
[29:09] said here stands the Lamb with a book in
[29:11] his hand right amen and there goes a
[29:13] white horse
[29:14] rider the mystery of iniquity was it was
[29:18] still in
[29:25] him oh don't get quiet right
[29:29] Amen brother R said he said before he
[29:31] preached it he said I'd have made a
[29:32] horrible
[29:33] mistake I would have preached my old
[29:35] notes which made that guy right there
[29:37] the the Holy Ghost and that would have
[29:39] been law because he was a prophet right
[29:43] everybody with me he said I have made a
[29:45] horrible mistake so what was going away
[29:48] from him false Doctrine or iniquity and
[29:51] there was the mystery that is in me and
[29:53] you until we see it right away from
[29:56] us we've got to see that thing leave
[29:59] us and not come back
[30:02] Hallelujah we got to see it leave we got
[30:05] to see what joy peace come in we got to
[30:08] see virtue knowledge Temperance come in
[30:10] and you know to replace that something's
[30:12] got to
[30:13] leave that's right in the Book of Luke
[30:16] it says what the unclean Spirit goes
[30:20] out brings seven more back it makes you
[30:24] worse if you don't fill it with
[30:26] something so the devil is not just going
[30:28] to leave and say sorry to interrupt your
[30:31] program I I'm not ever coming back no no
[30:34] no he's going to get smarter he's going
[30:37] to get more more um
[30:40] hidden cuz he was hiding he hides
[30:44] himself in Doctrine that's right he
[30:48] hides himself in Doctrine and then what
[30:51] you and I do is when we take that and
[30:53] accept that Doctrine we become that
[30:56] Doctrine and if it's false we become the
[31:01] devil there's nothing false in
[31:04] God we'll get to that in just a minute I
[31:07] let I want you to see something if we
[31:08] don't we'll get to it Sunday so when the
[31:10] lamb opened one of the seals now here's
[31:12] the lamb here's the judge here's the
[31:13] righteous
[31:14] one the
[31:16] justifier was standing
[31:19] there but remember we're going to get
[31:22] into something you might agree with me
[31:24] but it's something I saw today that I
[31:25] want to include in this but let's get
[31:27] through through this and just remember
[31:28] what I just said Satan is somewhere all
[31:32] the time if you're born again he can't
[31:35] be in your soul but he can be in your
[31:38] spirit realm bombarding you every
[31:41] day pray for me if if if he doesn't you
[31:45] I'm going to send you some of
[31:48] mine but he what did one of the four be
[31:51] said it says John come and what no come
[31:56] and understand yeah he saw what was
[31:59] riding off but he didn't understand what
[32:02] that was the bride now has an
[32:05] understanding of the mystery of iniquity
[32:07] of what that was it took a prophet to
[32:10] say no that's not the Holy Ghost that's
[32:12] Satan right that was a mystery there
[32:15] that was locked up from the foundation
[32:17] of the world many people have preached
[32:19] this
[32:20] different like brother R did the mighty
[32:23] conquer and all the different things but
[32:25] a white horse there was a there was a
[32:27] Doctrine went
[32:29] out and it was false and what did it do
[32:34] it Anointed The
[32:37] People CU we're going to get into this
[32:39] in just a little bit about isusa Street
[32:41] I've been reading today I'm going to
[32:43] read some more ausa Street brother Brown
[32:45] said the Holy Ghost
[32:48] himself came on the day of ausa Street
[32:52] amen no mess of the age I started on it
[32:54] last Sunday or last week right no mess
[32:57] of the age said the Holy Ghost came
[32:59] himself in the
[33:01] fullness fullness of the
[33:04] baptism and they were slain in the power
[33:07] of the spirit for 10 to 15 years they
[33:09] had church service three days
[33:12] continuous so much so the neighbors got
[33:15] mad and called the police and I think
[33:16] one of the policemen got converted when
[33:17] he went to talk to them you see how the
[33:20] power of God was during that time but
[33:22] remember remember here's my point they
[33:24] were
[33:25] trinitarians so that part of them was
[33:29] false amen amen that's the mystery of
[33:32] iniquity that had to be broke in the end
[33:34] time to show all those locin that were
[33:37] back in the in those ages that yeah they
[33:40] had truth Luther had truth Wesley had
[33:44] truth Pentecostals had truth they had
[33:46] the Holy Ghost come himself in in param
[33:49] and and daddy Seymour and all those
[33:51] different ones and and even in
[33:54] sisters right sorry about that
[33:59] and I know you
[34:02] saywell got to go by history there was
[34:05] one lady she was uh she was the one that
[34:08] got um daddy Seymour started it was
[34:11] through a sister but you get quiet on me
[34:14] that's okay I know women ain't supposed
[34:15] to preach and the Bible says they ain't
[34:17] supposed to preach that's why brother
[34:19] random hammered on it so much cuz they
[34:21] got away from that they got into the
[34:24] emotional
[34:25] part and that's why he had to bring them
[34:27] back back to Center well he brought some
[34:29] back some stayed out there all right but
[34:32] God can use a holy ghost filed sister
[34:34] that's why you sisters come and pray
[34:36] with other sisters right you're bringing
[34:39] your Holy Ghost you're not just bringing
[34:40] your femininity you're bringing your
[34:42] Holy
[34:43] Ghost that's connected to your
[34:46] femininity that can what that's brother
[34:48] R said what did that sister do that
[34:50] sister was a
[34:51] mother the sister had a baby that was
[34:54] sick she was a mother she could what
[34:57] sympathize and connect her Holy Ghost
[34:59] with her and brother R didn't have to
[35:00] touch up baby the Bible says lay hands
[35:02] on the sick and shall recover it doesn't
[35:04] say ministers lay hands on the
[35:06] sick I ain't preaching something false
[35:09] here sisters have the Holy Ghost and if
[35:11] they do they've got power they've got a
[35:14] position but they have power in the Holy
[35:17] Ghost right don't get scared it's all
[35:21] right you sisters have the Holy Ghost
[35:24] don't you it can't be it can't be
[35:26] different than mine and your and the and
[35:27] the brothers it just has a position
[35:31] though you're it's in a female body so
[35:34] that female body that fell way back over
[35:36] y had to come under a law or had to come
[35:39] under what headship but that's what the
[35:42] bride is she has to come under
[35:44] headship each one of us are feminist in
[35:46] the body of Christ but we have a holy
[35:51] ghost that powers every one of
[35:54] us if you let it out amen as I said
[35:58] before let it
[36:00] work brother I've never said a word
[36:03] about when a sister stand up and speak
[36:04] in tongues that's part of the
[36:07] body but he told him he said Just Don't
[36:09] Preach sisters you got your own what
[36:11] position but he didn't he didn't ever
[36:14] never blasted one sister for standing up
[36:16] and prophesying and one standing up and
[36:17] giving
[36:19] interpretation
[36:21] right he said Just Don't
[36:23] Preach he didn't say no you don't
[36:25] supposed to do that he said no you not
[36:26] supposed to preach
[36:28] and we know why because of the position
[36:30] that was in the come from the
[36:32] garden cuz listen when we get into
[36:35] heaven you sisters are going to have
[36:37] just as much power listen your body's
[36:39] got to be changed just like our men's
[36:40] body got to be changed hello that's
[36:45] right think about that but we see that
[36:49] there was a false Ministry loosed but
[36:51] where did it come out of it come out of
[36:53] what John saw what was loosed when that
[36:56] seal was open that was something in
[36:58] there that was false that had to
[37:00] go all right so God is beginning to
[37:04] justify his bride amen he's beginning to
[37:08] justify not his church his bride that's
[37:12] right amen so let's look here just a
[37:15] second we already talked about the line
[37:17] Ministry listen to this brother R was
[37:20] praying he said forgive
[37:22] us of our trespasses as we forgive those
[37:25] who trespassed against us and freely
[37:28] from our
[37:29] heart can you do
[37:33] this can you do
[37:35] that I asked them up at brother
[37:37] Richard's church and only a couple
[37:38] people raised their hand can you really
[37:40] pray for your enemies when somebody
[37:42] despitefully uses you you get on your
[37:44] knees and pray for their
[37:48] soul Jesus said you're to get in the
[37:51] Kingdom you got to be able to do
[37:53] that
[37:55] Hallelujah and freely from our heart
[37:59] listen this is not brother brandom
[38:01] adding these
[38:03] words cuz you could have just said him
[38:05] from our heart but watch it changes the
[38:08] whole thing freely from your heart oh I
[38:10] forgive them because brother Bob
[38:11] preached Sunday and I'm supposed to
[38:13] forgive him because he said to ain't got
[38:16] nothing to do with it you're going to
[38:17] have coals heat back on your head amen
[38:20] you got to freely from your heart from
[38:23] your
[38:24] soul we forgive everyone who has trusted
[38:27] passed against us look that our
[38:33] sins may be blotted out think of that
[38:38] you praying for somebody that spitefully
[38:40] uses you gets your sins forgiven you
[38:42] know the Bible tells us that if you come
[38:43] up in here have prayer and you get
[38:45] healed that even your sins are
[38:48] forgiven amen even your that's Bible I
[38:51] don't have I don't need a quote that's
[38:53] Bible the Bible says you come right
[38:56] praying and believing that if you get
[38:57] healed your sins are going to be
[38:59] forgiven amen amen oh my what a mighty
[39:02] God we serve what let's open the book so
[39:04] we can read this thing
[39:06] sometime that our sins may be blotted
[39:09] out take our iniquity and bury it in the
[39:14] sea of forgetfulness of thy
[39:17] blood Hallelujah second
[39:21] Thessalonians let no man deceive you by
[39:25] any means for that day shall not come
[39:28] except they come a falling away first
[39:30] we're seeing that now and that man of
[39:35] sin right be revealed or made known the
[39:40] son of predition look who opposes and
[39:43] exalted himself above all that is called
[39:46] God now
[39:48] listen Satan didn't get
[39:54] Eve to doubt there was a god
[39:57] right Satan didn't get to either doubt
[40:00] what God
[40:03] said he interpreted it to her so she'
[40:08] take it a different way from the pull
[40:10] pit from the pull
[40:13] pit who opposes and exalted himself
[40:15] above all that is called
[40:18] God or that is worshiped so that he as
[40:22] God sth in the temple of God showing
[40:26] himself
[40:28] that he is
[40:30] God and until that white horse rider
[40:32] rode off that's what was bound up in
[40:34] that
[40:36] seal right there was a Ministry loosed
[40:40] it was a false one but it came out of
[40:42] the truth that's right it had that you
[40:46] got to have truth first right you can't
[40:49] have false first false is what false is
[40:51] the opposite of Tru so true has to be
[40:53] here first you and I should walk in the
[40:56] truth
[40:57] that way we don't have to walk in the
[41:02] Falls remember you not that when I was
[41:04] yet with you I told you these things
[41:06] Paul blasted this thing his whole sermon
[41:09] everything the things I would not I do
[41:11] we' have a righteous judge remember all
[41:13] these things I'm telling you they're
[41:15] going to come in there Grievous wolves
[41:17] they're going to come in and and Lead
[41:18] silly women away this whole thing Paul's
[41:21] telling them he said now remember I told
[41:23] you these things and now you know what
[41:26] withhold
[41:27] that he might be revealed in his time he
[41:30] was revealed in this time right here yes
[41:33] sir we know where Satan's seat is they
[41:36] didn't know where Satan's seat was oh
[41:37] they thought it was in the barrooms or
[41:39] the prostitute places or or people that
[41:41] didn't come to church no it's in
[41:44] church amen hello amen and now you know
[41:50] what withholdeth that he might be
[41:52] revealed in his
[41:55] time for the mystery
[41:58] of
[41:59] iniquity doth already work Paul in the
[42:03] first church
[42:04] age only he who now lth will let who
[42:09] brother Brown said he God he's going to
[42:11] let this
[42:14] happen until he the bride he said
[42:17] brother Brown said be taken out of the
[42:19] way and then listen when the Gentile
[42:22] door is shut when he goes to the Jews
[42:25] Satan is going to be on his throne in
[42:27] the Gentile
[42:29] Kingdom and the Jewish Kingdom that's
[42:32] not the 144,000 he's going to rule the
[42:34] whole world folks folks he not going to
[42:36] be well now the whole nation of Jews no
[42:38] it ain't going to be the whole nation of
[42:39] Jews only 144,000 and2 are going to not
[42:43] be deceived everybody else is going to
[42:44] be deceived right and then shall that
[42:47] Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[42:50] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[42:53] shall destroy with the brightness of his
[42:56] coming what are we looking at right now
[42:59] this is the coming of the
[43:01] Lord this is it we are the coming of the
[43:05] Lord that's why that he'll be
[43:09] destroyed by the bride one
[43:12] day in the Gentile Church
[43:16] age through
[43:18] who through his bride so iniquity means
[43:23] unrighteousness are the condition of
[43:26] without law either because you're
[43:28] ignorant of it or because you violate it
[43:30] brother R said in in Kentucky terms he
[43:32] said iniquity is knowing to do
[43:34] better and you go and do it anyway or
[43:38] knowing you should do it and you don't
[43:40] do it you see we fall in iniquity if we
[43:43] say well we don't have to go to
[43:45] church right somebody say amen
[43:51] amen we fall into iniquity there's a
[43:53] demon that causes you to keep him going
[43:55] from going to church
[43:59] and where is it it's not in the
[44:01] preacher it's not the song leader it's
[44:04] not the guy that's supposed to be
[44:05] sitting beside of you in the
[44:06] Pew is in
[44:10] you so either because you're ignorant of
[44:13] it because you're violating it in other
[44:16] words you know to do better and you do
[44:17] it anyway all right so now
[44:20] watch here's the part I want you to if
[44:22] we get to nothing else we'll slow down
[44:24] right here okay
[44:28] this is what the uh what the Lord kind
[44:31] of backed me up on the show I didn't
[44:32] preach this at Brother Richard they just
[44:34] saw this afternoon so who is the son of
[44:38] man the son of man is God in human flesh
[44:43] living among
[44:46] humans all right now y'all quit looking
[44:48] up there stop that
[44:50] business
[44:53] but so the son of man is God and human
[44:57] flesh and I think y'all had the um the
[44:59] question at the last ministers meeting
[45:01] about was God was was Jesus all God or
[45:04] whatever happened to the body or you
[45:06] know let's just stop the
[45:09] confusion I come into this
[45:13] world the way you're looking at me now
[45:16] of course I wouldn't but about that
[45:18] big from an act between my mother my
[45:21] father that had natural sperm and
[45:23] natural
[45:24] egg everybody with me that's a called a
[45:28] sex act sorry but that's how we all come
[45:31] everybody come the same way I don't care
[45:32] if it's in vitro or whatever had to take
[45:34] this to put this right
[45:36] here all right so now what happened with
[45:39] Mary even brother random had to tell us
[45:41] because most denominations believe that
[45:43] Mary dropped an egg and God just
[45:46] produced a sperm and or germ let's say
[45:49] that and put it in right but brother R
[45:51] said no no no he said see what you would
[45:54] have God doing right
[45:58] see these are all these great Mysteries
[45:59] that that to me it pieces all the puzzle
[46:01] together it pieces the puzzle together
[46:04] makes it so clear that Mary says be it
[46:06] unto me according to Thy word God
[46:09] created a germ so who did that germ come
[46:12] from did it come from a human
[46:15] man huh did it come from
[46:18] Joseph just like your daddy and your
[46:20] mama even with Mary he made it so
[46:23] Supernatural till he produced the egg
[46:26] also
[46:27] right
[46:29] amen so that body whether you believe it
[46:32] or not was God
[46:35] Amen it was a human it had a human it
[46:37] had human characteristics yes sir I just
[46:41] folks I just believe in the Garden of
[46:43] Eden God had something in there that was
[46:45] his theophany that he talked to Adam and
[46:47] Eve with he can't change from that he
[46:50] came down here to put Flesh on to die
[46:52] for me and you that's got Flesh on
[46:55] us amen brother amen that's what he did
[47:00] but he didn't come through an act he
[47:02] come from what spoken word creation yes
[47:06] so yes the body was human the body got
[47:12] old amen but it came from God right and
[47:16] it was the possession of God because
[47:17] what did he do on the day of the
[47:20] Resurrection he didn't go get him
[47:21] another one he thought so much of that
[47:24] one he went and picked it up as bad as
[47:27] it was it been beat to a
[47:30] pulp and when that when that when that
[47:32] body stepped up out of that
[47:34] grave he didn't look like dog meat
[47:37] then no no no he might have still had
[47:41] the scars he might have still had the
[47:43] theci side but he didn't look like he'd
[47:46] been mutilated and run through a grinder
[47:49] it changed that
[47:51] body so the son of man lived among
[47:54] humans
[47:57] amen he's the true
[47:59] Superman and you want to look for a
[48:01] Superman he's the true
[48:03] Superman he came from another
[48:06] world to This World by an act of
[48:11] faith not conception between a man a man
[48:14] and a woman right he spoke it it
[48:19] happened yes it went through the law of
[48:22] planting a seed yes he went through the
[48:23] law that it had to come out of the womb
[48:25] it had it all that had for do was for me
[48:28] and you though right he had to be our
[48:30] brother so the son of man is our brother
[48:35] amen
[48:36] right now the Son of
[48:39] God is a tad bit
[48:43] different because now he's living in
[48:46] humans when he was the son of man he
[48:48] wasn't living in
[48:52] humans you with me he was living among
[48:56] humans saving those people knowing he
[48:58] could get back in
[49:00] them to save
[49:02] them but now here's my point let's see
[49:05] if you can you all amen and let's see if
[49:06] you amen
[49:08] this so the son of
[49:11] man now watch him in the
[49:14] Bible he's not very
[49:17] nice oh come on people you read your
[49:19] Bible don't you
[49:21] amen he said I didn't come to bring
[49:25] peace amen
[49:27] but a sword he said I'm going to make
[49:30] mother against father or mother against
[49:32] daughter father against
[49:34] son who is my
[49:38] family didn't even call his mother
[49:40] mother called a
[49:44] woman beat a bunch of people out of a
[49:46] church one
[49:48] time sat there and went all right when I
[49:51] get done this and I tie it down at the
[49:53] end y'all going to get a beating amen
[49:56] that was the son of
[49:58] man now we know the Son of God was
[50:00] inside there but look at the
[50:02] dispensation watch how we're going to
[50:04] change in that dispensation in just a
[50:07] few minutes everybody with me all right
[50:09] so the son of man sure he said father
[50:12] only thing he ever said really positive
[50:15] was was father forgive them they don't
[50:16] know what they're
[50:17] doing he was always calling them snakes
[50:20] vipers
[50:23] prostitutes nobody got saved under his
[50:25] ministry
[50:28] not while he was here Brothers
[50:31] nobody oh the thief on the cross got
[50:33] eternal life for his
[50:36] testimony but that wasn't a new birth
[50:39] that wasn't his children there was no
[50:42] children born until Jesus
[50:44] left because that's where that comes
[50:47] from living in humans he had to leave
[50:50] I've got to go away he
[50:52] said but I'm going to send you what I'm
[50:55] going to send I'm going to send you your
[50:56] sword I'm going to send you a
[50:58] comforter amen hallelujah I'm going to
[51:01] put this thing I'm going to put this
[51:03] thing back together in human
[51:06] beings I'm not going to do it by myself
[51:09] though I'm God
[51:11] Almighty I'm going to do it through
[51:13] human beings I'm going to live in
[51:17] them so now the son of man is supposed
[51:20] to come back in the end time let's see
[51:23] if you amen
[51:25] this so we're talking
[51:29] about in the church
[51:32] ages he was a the Son of
[51:35] God all right real quick slow down he
[51:40] was the son of God now remember brother
[51:42] R said that son of man on Earth Son of
[51:45] God through the church ages what God
[51:47] living in human people showing an
[51:50] extending Grace amen that's right
[51:55] through people right yeah
[51:59] listen why didn't
[52:02] Paul why didn't Paul on the road to
[52:06] Damascus if everybody once talked about
[52:08] this seed laying in somebody and being
[52:11] dormant and all whatever that it's just
[52:13] not not
[52:15] true when are we going to talking to
[52:17] somebody yesterday when are we going to
[52:19] get to re start realizing that brother
[52:21] brandham said a lot of
[52:23] things that men take wrong
[52:27] amen come on that's right every false
[52:30] Doctrine in this message didn't come
[52:32] from John J Lake been or John G
[52:36] Lake right didn't come
[52:40] from Billy
[52:43] Graham it came from what brother randam
[52:48] said that's why he said Rapture and
[52:51] Faith lays in not
[52:54] on Rapture and Faith lays in those books
[52:56] and tapes you got to have a revelation
[52:59] how are you going to have a revelation
[53:00] when Jesus stood there and said you got
[53:02] to eat my body before you can get to
[53:05] heaven thank you Jesus didn't he stand
[53:08] and say that listen that's a direct
[53:11] quote from God himself right from an
[53:15] eternal word that you can't change
[53:19] amen so when are we going to start
[53:21] getting the Revelation behind what the
[53:23] prophet of God said I've always told you
[53:25] it's the Ence of this message is going
[53:27] to change us not The Written Letter Paul
[53:29] said the letter
[53:31] kth the letter is going to kill us if we
[53:34] keep reading it where you can get a
[53:37] polygamy come on somebody where do you
[53:39] think that Doctrine came from right uh
[53:42] two
[53:43] Souls seven Thunders
[53:47] amen
[53:48] perusia no Holy Ghost until you get way
[53:51] up y where'd that come from off the
[53:54] books and tapes amen
[53:57] and you can find a d direct quote that's
[53:58] what me and brother was talking about
[54:00] like Brother D always said he said you
[54:02] give me a quote he said a few minutes
[54:04] later I'll find you one that looks like
[54:06] I said look like it contradicted each
[54:09] other that's why these people are
[54:11] leaving the message they ain't got any
[54:13] holy ghost at
[54:14] all amen they just have an anointing
[54:17] that can't put the three or four quotes
[54:20] together
[54:21] amen we've had a Ministry in this church
[54:24] that puts the quotes together and gives
[54:26] it
[54:28] [Applause]
[54:30] Clarity and that's what we're living off
[54:32] of the body word of the son of
[54:35] man as brother R tells
[54:40] us not a man's idea so now if the son of
[54:45] man lived among
[54:47] humans and he was God he was God in Body
[54:51] Spirit and
[54:52] soul everybody agree with me Body Spirit
[54:56] and soul
[54:56] he didn't have another body from a man
[54:58] and a
[54:59] woman he didn't have another Spirit from
[55:01] somebody else like we have a spiritual
[55:05] part of us that was brought on To
[55:08] Us by our parents grandparents hello you
[55:13] know what brother BR
[55:17] said
[55:19] right if I walk like this and my grandpa
[55:22] walked like this you know through your
[55:24] DNA well God didn't have a DNA he's his
[55:27] own
[55:28] DNA that's why he's having to change us
[55:30] from the inside
[55:31] out and I'm going to say this real real
[55:34] slow he can't change us from the outside
[55:36] in that's right that's right right it's
[55:39] his
[55:40] law amen it's his law as you came the
[55:42] way you're supposed to
[55:45] come now really you didn't but you came
[55:47] the way God saw you were supposed to
[55:49] come we were supposed to come spoken
[55:50] word children that's why we're heading
[55:52] back to that son of
[55:55] man where God's going to start living
[55:57] among humans Amen in
[56:01] you that's the transforming power of God
[56:03] I'm not I'm not here to tell you that
[56:06] talking Brother Richard Wilson we were
[56:07] talking about this and he said and it's
[56:10] true we're God Amen but don't get
[56:14] confused with us being the Big G right
[56:17] remember what Brother D don't don't get
[56:19] us confused with being the Big G right
[56:22] he made us Little G's but the only way
[56:24] we can be a little G is to be connected
[56:27] to the Big G amen and then the way he
[56:30] sees it is no different they're together
[56:31] because that's what we came from that's
[56:34] the source of that fountain that comes
[56:35] in but listen here's my point did the
[56:39] son of man ever make a mistake in his
[56:46] Doctrine when Jesus was on Earth he
[56:49] never said I didn't really mean to say
[56:52] that strike that from the
[56:53] record everything you said Brother John
[56:56] was perfect and
[56:57] eternal correct them
[57:00] amen think about it everything he
[57:06] said his Doctrine was
[57:09] always correct
[57:12] Hallelujah but now he knew though coming
[57:16] and living in human beings there was a
[57:19] filter he had to go through everybody
[57:22] with me are you understanding what I'm
[57:23] saying this is way you were going to
[57:25] understand why Luther could be a
[57:27] trinitarian and still have the Holy
[57:28] Ghost
[57:30] right that was a little something in my
[57:32] mind I couldn't really get straightened
[57:34] out I can
[57:35] now cuz the son of man can't make a
[57:38] mistake he's an individual
[57:42] person the only the only reason we're
[57:45] going we're going to be that cuz he said
[57:46] we were he said we were it didn't come
[57:49] through another preacher he
[57:51] said right that we'd be the son of man
[57:54] in the end time and brother Bram just
[57:56] made it plain Luke 17:30 all the one all
[57:59] the scriptures when the son of man's
[58:01] been what revealed where's it going to
[58:03] be revealed in Jesus is not coming back
[58:04] to the
[58:05] Earth his feet is not going to touch
[58:07] this Earth till the
[58:09] Millennium who's he going to work
[58:11] through human
[58:13] beings that he's anointed and Justified
[58:17] that's right that's where I'm getting to
[58:19] Justified where the just and the
[58:22] justifier is the same
[58:24] person but you can't have false Doctrine
[58:28] and claim the son of man Ministry in the
[58:31] end time that's right amen not one word
[58:34] Brother Richard said he said one word
[58:36] got him out one word off of them get us
[58:38] back in but you can live under the Son
[58:41] of God Ministry living in humans God
[58:44] knew he has to go through a filter
[58:46] though he's got to go through the memory
[58:47] reason conscious effect and Imagination
[58:49] to get to your
[58:51] soul right and you can let a demon get
[58:54] on you now listen son of man another
[58:56] thing let me back up a minute did a son
[58:58] of man ever have to say I need to get
[59:00] rid of that I got a demon on me did he
[59:04] ever say
[59:06] that no but every demon that came
[59:08] against him or came up to him they said
[59:10] we know who you
[59:12] are we know who you are we've seen you
[59:15] back in we've seen come on somebody
[59:18] we've seen you
[59:22] already they were so spiritual they
[59:25] could see past that flesh right that the
[59:29] Pharisees couldn't see past his flesh
[59:31] they thought he was wrong they thought
[59:33] everything you did was
[59:34] wrong amen but you can't make the son of
[59:37] man do something wrong
[59:39] right right exactly he was just he was
[59:43] just in what he said amen and if we're
[59:47] claiming the son of man Ministries back
[59:49] in the end time we got to be that very
[59:52] same thing we got to be a different
[59:54] group of people living among human
[59:56] beings who are dirty right and
[1:00:00] filthy but be as righteous as God is why
[1:00:04] do you think people under the Son of God
[1:00:06] Ministry has to pass away they have to
[1:00:10] die I I'm
[1:00:12] sorry they don't have enough word to
[1:00:14] change their
[1:00:16] body don't get quiet on
[1:00:20] me the only thing that took Jesus to
[1:00:23] death wasn't his false Doctrine it was
[1:00:24] me and you with our false
[1:00:27] Doctrine amen my false Doctrine started
[1:00:30] when my Mom and Daddy got
[1:00:34] together born in sin shap in iniquity
[1:00:37] brother Brown said you were trapped into
[1:00:40] it that's right
[1:00:42] right
[1:00:46] am we'll get into that a little bit more
[1:00:49] but I want you to realize if we're
[1:00:50] claiming if we're shouting that the son
[1:00:52] of man Ministry is here it's got to be a
[1:00:54] ministry that's not wrong he's got a
[1:00:56] Ministry that is above and beyond human
[1:00:59] beings amen come on
[1:01:04] yes this listen the Son of God is
[1:01:06] eternal so don't don't claim that Luther
[1:01:09] didn't make it Luther made it Luther is
[1:01:11] just as Eternal as you
[1:01:13] are but he had some false ideas that God
[1:01:17] couldn't that's right remember the Holy
[1:01:20] Ghost brother R said is the most timid
[1:01:23] person yeah amen any little something
[1:01:29] and and I know that's not ever happened
[1:01:31] to any of
[1:01:34] y'all pray for me
[1:01:36] then
[1:01:41] yeah because we have a filter he knew we
[1:01:45] were born in sin shapen in iniquity he
[1:01:48] knew we'd have problems he saw us
[1:01:51] already have those problems right but he
[1:01:54] made a way to get out of of it but in
[1:01:56] the end time we got to step it up a
[1:01:58] little higher remember look look right
[1:02:00] here real quick we receive the Holy
[1:02:03] Ghost right here to New Birth everybody
[1:02:04] say Amen baby b newborn what baby in
[1:02:09] Christ am I'm leaning down so you can
[1:02:11] see this not something wrong with my
[1:02:16] back now this holy spirit is not
[1:02:19] different from this
[1:02:21] one but it is amen
[1:02:27] this one right here has all these
[1:02:30] virtues sealed in this one down here
[1:02:33] does
[1:02:36] not but it's the same Holy Ghost it's
[1:02:39] just working in a different
[1:02:41] capacity now all right is everybody with
[1:02:44] me brother R said Son of God through
[1:02:47] seven Church
[1:02:49] ages
[1:02:50] amen who's
[1:02:54] that that's not some Son of
[1:02:57] God right I know it's hard for some of
[1:02:59] you young ones to believe to see this
[1:03:01] but that's not the Son of God that's the
[1:03:03] son of man The Headstone is the son of
[1:03:06] man Ministry in the end time that has to
[1:03:09] cap
[1:03:10] off a group of people that have come

[1:06:20] get condemned every day but where do we
[1:06:22] get condemned from brother Danny we get
[1:06:25] condemn from that guy right
[1:06:27] here stop condemning yourself if you're
[1:06:30] a child of God stop
[1:06:37] it but we are not of them
[1:06:41] oh he separated us
[1:06:44] somewhere but you are not of them who
[1:06:46] draw back under predition but of them
[1:06:49] that believe to the saving of the Soul
[1:06:54] amen oh amen
[1:06:56] man now do you believe this I said this
[1:06:58] the other day do you believe this now
[1:07:00] miam and them looking back brother R
[1:07:02] said this on 1955 water from the Rock
[1:07:05] and saw that separation annihilated from
[1:07:08] their enemies forever how long how long
[1:07:11] was they going to be safe for these
[1:07:13] Egyptians that you see
[1:07:15] today now let me
[1:07:17] say um kind of a
[1:07:21] panoramic Here Comes Israel across
[1:07:26] now this is pretty Dawning because the
[1:07:28] Red Sea is like you know 75 or 80 ft
[1:07:31] deep are everybody with me so there's a
[1:07:34] wall of water that's 80 feet high on
[1:07:36] both sides of
[1:07:38] you and you're looking at
[1:07:40] it and God overnight has dried you up a
[1:07:44] path because how many of y'all have
[1:07:45] walked into a into a lake mud goes up
[1:07:49] through your toes and it's pretty muddy
[1:07:52] anyway even when the water goes away it
[1:07:54] takes a long time God blew that thing
[1:07:56] off so much till it was nothing but like
[1:07:58] hard
[1:07:59] pavement amen right their wheels didn't
[1:08:03] sink in the
[1:08:04] mud he just said come
[1:08:07] on you're my chosen
[1:08:10] people so they go through that thing and
[1:08:13] they're all going through and they're
[1:08:15] I'm sure there's some Dayan and coras in
[1:08:16] there the
[1:08:17] unbelievers but they turn around and
[1:08:19] look and there are the things still open
[1:08:25] and here comes the
[1:08:27] Egyptian here comes all them demons that
[1:08:30] you thought you had got rid of
[1:08:34] right I mean chariots racing as fast as
[1:08:37] they can race I like watching that
[1:08:39] movie Ten Commandments I mean here they
[1:08:42] come
[1:08:42] man they're going to destroy them
[1:08:45] because here's couple million people up
[1:08:47] on a bank brother Danny and they're
[1:08:48] standing there and they're watching and
[1:08:51] here they come they're getting closer
[1:08:53] and closer God's not doing nothing
[1:08:55] nothing closer and closer and closer and
[1:09:00] closer then all of a sudden Moses just
[1:09:02] takes his
[1:09:03] ride and right before he sticks it in
[1:09:06] the gra into water he turns around and
[1:09:08] he says these Egyptians you see
[1:09:11] today these sins you see
[1:09:16] today you'll never see them again amen
[1:09:20] and I think he put
[1:09:23] forever justif
[1:09:27] chopped off their past
[1:09:28] sins got rid of their enemy not one
[1:09:31] there wasn't one that drug yourself up
[1:09:34] on the on the other
[1:09:36] side there was not one of your sins if
[1:09:39] you make sure that you put it in that
[1:09:41] sea that you know you've been Justified
[1:09:44] there's not one going to come crawling
[1:09:46] up a couple days later they didn't
[1:09:48] reform the Army on this side no it
[1:09:50] destroyed
[1:09:51] them it destroyed them they didn't come
[1:09:54] this way anymore so what did the
[1:09:56] children of Israel do they turned and
[1:09:58] walked for 40 years in
[1:10:03] sanctification to get rid of the old
[1:10:04] fighters to get rid of the old part of
[1:10:07] them that had what
[1:10:09] disbelieved the whole
[1:10:11] time brother Ram said look these
[1:10:13] Egyptians you see today you'll see no
[1:10:15] more forever amen put them in the sea of
[1:10:17] forgetfulness and remember them no more
[1:10:19] that's what kind of God we have not goes
[1:10:22] and digs it up again and holds it
[1:10:24] against you I forgot about
[1:10:27] it so justification is your Red Sea
[1:10:30] experience sanctification is that
[1:10:32] 40-year journey to get rid of all the
[1:10:34] what all the
[1:10:36] demons and then the Holy Ghost takes you
[1:10:38] into the promised
[1:10:40] land pretty pretty simple standing in
[1:10:42] the Gap brother Ram said look today he's
[1:10:45] the only mediator between God and man
[1:10:47] and we're freely pardoned and forgiven
[1:10:49] God don't even know we ever
[1:10:51] sinned when we going to start believing
[1:10:53] a prophet amen
[1:10:57] our sins were put in the sea of
[1:10:59] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[1:11:01] more we cannot do that ourself we are
[1:11:04] finite we're sitting here today knowing
[1:11:06] we are finite people we remember if we
[1:11:09] don't remember the sin devil makees sure
[1:11:12] we
[1:11:14] do but look he is
[1:11:16] infinite and our finite we can still
[1:11:19] remember because we're not big enough I
[1:11:22] like what he say we're not big enough
[1:11:24] but he is so great that he even forgets
[1:11:26] we ever did
[1:11:27] Sin we are sons and daughters in his
[1:11:30] presence all things that he was we are
[1:11:33] he become my sin that I might become his
[1:11:35] righteousness he became your sin that
[1:11:38] you might become his righteousness so
[1:11:40] God cannot see no sin in you as long as
[1:11:43] your confession is in Christ Jesus amen
[1:11:46] remember what brother R told him he said
[1:11:47] don't come up here in the prayer line
[1:11:49] and have sin in your
[1:11:50] life what he tell them to do now you go
[1:11:53] back and two days later you just make
[1:11:54] sure you you pray for you know 24 hours
[1:11:56] straight he said no he said you bow your
[1:11:59] head and you for ask for God to forgive
[1:12:01] you your sins he said he'll put it under
[1:12:02] the blood and I won't be able to see it
[1:12:03] and he won't be able to sit it amen wow
[1:12:06] what a mighty God we serve Satan has
[1:12:08] made our sins so
[1:12:11] huge till he's got us
[1:12:15] bound we got to loose oursel from that
[1:12:18] but we got to do it through the
[1:12:20] justifier let him tell us let listen
[1:12:24] remember is he not our Advocate amen
[1:12:27] we'll get into that when we talk about
[1:12:28] the Holy Ghost he's your Advocate what
[1:12:30] does your Advocate do it speaks for you
[1:12:33] amen let him speak for
[1:12:36] you Satan comes at you read what God's
[1:12:39] already wrote amen not only is our sins
[1:12:42] forgiven but they are buried in the sea
[1:12:44] of forgetfulness to be remembered no
[1:12:46] more for they are gone they're out of
[1:12:49] the eyes of God they're
[1:12:51] paralyzed they're divorced they're put
[1:12:54] away God don't remember them no more the
[1:12:56] church ought to Rejoice this morning to
[1:12:58] know that our sins will no more be
[1:12:59] remembered they are put in the sea of
[1:13:01] forgetfulness into the grave of Beyond
[1:13:03] any Resurrection oh let me ask you a
[1:13:05] question if we are under the son of man
[1:13:07] Ministry did he have any sin I'm going
[1:13:09] to cover that again did he have any
[1:13:12] sin
[1:13:14] huh he didn't have any sin son of man
[1:13:16] never sinned that's right now listen it
[1:13:19] doesn't mean that he didn't have a bad
[1:13:21] thought though
[1:13:29] you said no I
[1:13:30] don't he called Herod an old Fox he made
[1:13:34] a few comments that were you know he he
[1:13:37] actually was thinking as a
[1:13:39] human he had to be human folks but there
[1:13:42] was something inside of him that we
[1:13:44] supposed to have in us
[1:13:47] today that takes care of
[1:13:50] that he decided this we didn't and if he
[1:13:55] decided it to work this way guess what
[1:13:57] it will work this way he'll find
[1:14:00] somebody that will live by
[1:14:05] faith and nothing
[1:14:08] else they are dead forever forgotten
[1:14:11] about they are as if they had never
[1:14:15] happened you want me to prove that
[1:14:17] Revelation 6 ver9 and we'll
[1:14:19] close this is the greatest this is the
[1:14:22] fifth seal now brother brandom when he
[1:14:25] was when he was studying this if you'll
[1:14:28] look in the first part of the of the um
[1:14:31] um six the fifth seal
[1:14:35] sermon he said this is beyond what I
[1:14:38] thought do remember he thought these
[1:14:40] were Souls under the altar come on
[1:14:42] brother Brown
[1:14:46] thought that those were the souls under
[1:14:48] the
[1:14:49] altar
[1:14:52] Saints under the altar
[1:14:57] right what the Holy Spirit tell
[1:15:00] him cuz remember the son of man had to
[1:15:02] be
[1:15:06] prevalent during that whole week that's
[1:15:09] why he said I've never worked in this
[1:15:10] realm like this before he seen the Son
[1:15:13] of God heal raise the dead tell people
[1:15:14] where they live but never has he seen
[1:15:17] something come on the scene so much and
[1:15:19] tear everything he thought was right
[1:15:23] amen tore it apart
[1:15:26] and said this is it why do you get over
[1:15:28] to different places like thank God for
[1:15:30] the opening of the seals we got marriage
[1:15:31] and divorce thank God for the open of
[1:15:33] the seals serpent SE thank God for the
[1:15:34] open of the seals all these things he
[1:15:36] went right back to the open of the seals
[1:15:38] why he'd read them a thousand
[1:15:41] times and when he had opened the fifth
[1:15:43] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[1:15:45] them that were slain now look
[1:15:46] Souls all right these Souls were put in
[1:15:49] a
[1:15:52] place of them that were slain for the
[1:15:54] word of God for the testimony which they
[1:15:56] held now we know who this is this is the
[1:15:59] fifth seal Jew the martyred
[1:16:03] Jews that didn't even like Jesus at all
[1:16:08] never testified about
[1:16:12] him never said he was their
[1:16:15] savior
[1:16:18] hello they were
[1:16:20] Jews they got killed in the slaughter
[1:16:23] just because they were Jews
[1:16:28] and they CED with a loud voice saying
[1:16:29] how long oh Lord holy and true dust thou
[1:16:32] not judge see they knew he had to be a
[1:16:34] righteous
[1:16:36] judge and avenge our blood so right
[1:16:40] there the Holy Spirit should come on
[1:16:41] Brother brandham come on Prophet that's
[1:16:45] not that's not a
[1:16:46] Believer that's not a born- again
[1:16:48] believer cuz they would be
[1:16:50] saying have
[1:16:52] mercy he said avenge our blood on him
[1:16:55] that dwell on the earth Hallelujah and
[1:16:56] white robes were
[1:17:01] given They didn't accept
[1:17:04] it they didn't even want
[1:17:07] it come
[1:17:11] on they were just six million Jews that
[1:17:14] died because they were
[1:17:16] Jews Hitler loosed that 200,000,000
[1:17:19] demons out of the river Euphrates on to
[1:17:22] that group of people and killed
[1:17:26] him and God being a righteous
[1:17:30] judge knew what he was doing you know
[1:17:34] why I'll read it to you in just a second
[1:17:36] and white robes were given unto every
[1:17:37] one of them it was said unto them that
[1:17:39] they should rest yet for a little season
[1:17:41] until their fellow servants what the
[1:17:43] 144,000 that's living right
[1:17:45] now should be killed as they were should
[1:17:49] be fulfilled amen now they didn't want
[1:17:52] it but God give it to them right right
[1:17:55] now we can't pull
[1:17:57] that cuz we're not Jews
[1:18:00] sir this is
[1:18:02] why Romans
[1:18:04] 11:25 for I would not Brethren that you
[1:18:07] should be ignorant of this mystery
[1:18:09] Paul's telling us this is a
[1:18:12] mystery lest you should be wise in your
[1:18:15] own conceit that blindness in part is
[1:18:17] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[1:18:20] the Gentiles become come in all right if
[1:18:25] if God didn't if God didn't
[1:18:27] see hear me real real hear me out he saw
[1:18:32] a gentile bride that wanted him more
[1:18:34] than Israel did
[1:18:36] right come
[1:18:38] on he never took that Daniel 70 weeks
[1:18:41] and pulled it
[1:18:42] apart and literally blinded his own
[1:18:45] people so that you and me can come in
[1:18:48] but being a righteous judge he had to
[1:18:49] give him eternal life cuz he blinded him
[1:18:55] so when the fullness of the Gentiles be
[1:18:57] come in guess what he's going to lift
[1:18:58] his hand off of their eyes they're going
[1:19:00] to see who first thing immediately
[1:19:02] they're going to see the Messiah right
[1:19:05] through two prophets right verse 26 and
[1:19:08] so all Israel shall be saved that it is
[1:19:10] written they shall come out out of Zion
[1:19:12] to deliver and shall turn away the
[1:19:14] ungodliness from Jacob listen to this
[1:19:16] sixfold purpose and we musicians come on
[1:19:19] we'll finish rest of this later on
[1:19:21] there's more of this when brother Brown
[1:19:23] comes with the invisible union he he one
[1:19:25] month from being killed in a car wreck
[1:19:27] he preaches in streetport Louisiana on
[1:19:29] Thanksgiving day he says this is my
[1:19:31] Thanksgiving Day message to you that
[1:19:34] you're The Virtuous sinless bride of
[1:19:36] Jesus Christ you didn't do it you didn't
[1:19:40] do it in the first place you were
[1:19:41] trapped into
[1:19:42] it watch this that's where they done it
[1:19:45] he was making the end of sin for them
[1:19:47] who the Jews how could he do anything
[1:19:50] else but forgive them knowing he had to
[1:19:54] Blind their eyes so that we could come
[1:19:57] in it's like his own children calling
[1:19:59] for his blood remember they said let his
[1:20:01] blood be on us and our
[1:20:02] children that's the reason he cried for
[1:20:05] forgiveness for them Father forgive them
[1:20:06] they don't know what they're doing they
[1:20:08] were blind for our sake they were made
[1:20:12] blind so God had to be
[1:20:15] just the greatest gift of
[1:20:20] justification when you were out and sin
[1:20:22] did you want God to forgive you of your
[1:20:24] sins you didn't
[1:20:25] care I just tell you right now you
[1:20:27] didn't
[1:20:29] care there was nothing good in any of us
[1:20:32] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:20:34] the glory of
[1:20:35] God but thank God God had a
[1:20:39] mind and in his mind he had a vision but
[1:20:43] when God ever thinks of something in his
[1:20:44] mind Brother Gary it's got to come to
[1:20:46] pass when he saw that a gentile bride
[1:20:49] was going to love him more than Israel
[1:20:51] he had to pull that 70 weeks apart slap
[1:20:53] a gentile bride in in there that would
[1:20:55] love him and cherish him and be
[1:20:59] his mate but he's not going to forget
[1:21:02] Israel though because he's going to come
[1:21:03] right back and save that group over here
[1:21:06] and he's going to save this fifth sealed
[1:21:07] Jew that didn't they listen when they
[1:21:10] died they were looking for a
[1:21:12] messiah come on they were looking for a
[1:21:15] messiah they didn't know he was already
[1:21:17] here and had already
[1:21:20] left everybody with me
[1:21:28] they're buried in the sea of
[1:21:29] forgetfulness let's stand think of a sea
[1:21:32] of forgetfulness God cannot remember
[1:21:34] them no more because they were both dead
[1:21:35] and buried it cannot even be remembered
[1:21:38] no more they're out of God's memory amen
[1:21:42] now here I'm going to read you this real
[1:21:43] quick look up the word brother Brown
[1:21:45] said this is invisible Union the word
[1:21:47] don't mean forgiven the word means
[1:21:49] Justified it don't mean you're
[1:21:52] forgiven for instance you heard I got
[1:21:54] drunk and done some evil thing and
[1:21:56] everything and you come around and say
[1:21:58] to me you found out I didn't do
[1:22:02] them are you going to say brother R I
[1:22:05] forgive you for that forgive me for what
[1:22:07] I didn't do it in the first place
[1:22:09] brother R I forgive you forgive me I
[1:22:11] didn't do it at the first place now if I
[1:22:13] did it I'm guilty am I with
[1:22:17] me but you could forgive me and I
[1:22:19] wouldn't be
[1:22:21] guilty but yet I'm not justified because
[1:22:24] I actually did
[1:22:26] it but the word Justified is though
[1:22:28] you've never done it listen that's the
[1:22:32] Revelation revealed under the
[1:22:37] seals that's the whole revelation of
[1:22:39] underneath that seal is to show
[1:22:42] us that right
[1:22:44] there it's not even regarded at
[1:22:48] all in God's book of SE of forgetfulness
[1:22:51] your old book in marriage is divorced
[1:22:53] and dead
[1:22:55] it's not even in the memories of
[1:23:02] God so why why do we let stuff beat us
[1:23:05] up
[1:23:06] for because the devil has one foothold
[1:23:10] on us and that's our mind up here not
[1:23:13] our heart he has right here he can play
[1:23:15] greatest battle ever fought all right
[1:23:17] remember it's not down here if you're
[1:23:18] born
[1:23:19] again it's up
[1:23:21] here amen you are Justified therefore
[1:23:24] being Justified it was accused you were
[1:23:26] accused You' never done it in the first
[1:23:27] place the old Union is in the sea of
[1:23:29] forgetfulness now remember the old Union
[1:23:31] there was an old Union you were born and
[1:23:34] S but you got to realize as brother R
[1:23:37] says right here you
[1:23:39] were trapped into it you never send it
[1:23:43] the first place God don't even know it's
[1:23:46] in the sea of forgetfulness you never
[1:23:47] did it you were accused of it by the
[1:23:49] accuser but really from the beginning
[1:23:51] you were predestinated to be a son and
[1:23:54] daughter of God you're standing there
[1:23:56] washed and your old book of divorcement
[1:23:58] is put away and dead absolutely how when
[1:24:00] we going to start believing what brother
[1:24:02] B
[1:24:02] said he's quoting the Bible to us those
[1:24:05] he's Justified he's already glorified
[1:24:08] now if you try to justify yourself
[1:24:10] you'll never get to that but he who is
[1:24:13] he has Justified he's already
[1:24:16] glorified you're standing there watching
[1:24:18] your old book of divorcement is put away
[1:24:20] dead absolutely AB resistance even in
[1:24:23] the mind of God The Virtuous bride of
[1:24:25] Christ washed in the blood of Christ
[1:24:27] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[1:24:29] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[1:24:32] word let me give you a little
[1:24:35] secret that's not in another
[1:24:41] dimension that's going to happen right
[1:24:43] here in this
[1:24:46] Dimension it's going to be real easy to
[1:24:48] think that maybe we can pass on and we
[1:24:51] get a glorified body and we in heaven
[1:24:54] he's talking about right now that's his
[1:24:56] that's his Thanksgiving message to us
[1:24:58] that it's going to happen right now not

[1:29:59] different Holy Ghost it's not two or
[1:30:01] three different jesuses that mystery of
[1:30:03] iniquity is brother B was preaching not
[1:30:04] too long ago when you see that first
[1:30:06] Hill open you see one God cuz when you
[1:30:08] see one God there's no other God before
[1:30:10] me there's no other God behind me
[1:30:12] there's no other God riding on that
[1:30:14] horse he's right there that's where he
[1:30:18] is God's in his people not in three
[1:30:20] different people sure it's a
[1:30:22] manifestation of the Holy ghost but it's
[1:30:25] as brother R said it was a dip Luther
[1:30:27] had a dip of the Holy Ghost now not a
[1:30:29] different one it was the same water in
[1:30:31] the ocean just a small
[1:30:33] dip Wesley got a little bit bigger dip
[1:30:36] to be Sanctified the isua street
[1:30:39] Pentecost they got a pretty big ladle
[1:30:42] for cuz they had to go all over the
[1:30:44] world but it denominated and died amen
[1:30:48] but you and
[1:30:50] I you and I don't take a dip
[1:30:55] that's right we're the
[1:30:56] ocean amen we're the
[1:30:59] ocean we're the ocean from when all that
[1:31:01] came from God saved the best for last
[1:31:05] we'll make it we're going to get it
[1:31:08] done and we're going to get it done

[1:31:15] know where we are and who we are and
[1:31:19] what we're doing
[1:31:20] here that's a revelation cuz when you
[1:31:23] see that then see whatever you got
[1:31:25] harboring inside of you that mystery
[1:31:27] that iniquity is going to take off
[1:31:30] that's what's going to drive the unclean
