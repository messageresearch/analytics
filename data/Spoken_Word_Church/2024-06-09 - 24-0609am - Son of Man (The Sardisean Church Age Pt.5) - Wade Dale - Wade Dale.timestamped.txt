[22:47] amen now for those of you that haven't
[22:49] been here in a while or been here we're
[22:51] on a um series that called the son of
[22:54] man which has been about a year or so
[22:56] ago but we're in the sardian church age
[22:58] we're going to talk about that but we're
[22:59] going to back up just a little bit so
[23:00] let's read Revelations 1:10 can
[23:02] everybody see that okay I was in the
[23:05] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[23:06] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[23:08] now this is John now remember as we get
[23:10] through going through this I was
[23:11] thinking about this the other day John
[23:14] was required to write what he saw not
[23:16] give a
[23:17] revelation all right John wasn't
[23:21] preaching he was he was he said write
[23:24] these things that you see and send them
[23:27] to the churches all right but it took a
[23:30] prophet in the end time to get the
[23:32] Revelation that John didn't
[23:35] get and then bring it to us that's the
[23:37] Love Letter that's the in between saying
[23:40] I am Alpha and Omega because see the
[23:42] alpha he was in the alpha church but the
[23:43] Omega Church hadn't come yet that's us
[23:45] that's right all right I am the Alpha
[23:47] and Omega the first and the last and
[23:48] what thou seest write in the book send
[23:50] it to the seven churches which are in
[23:52] Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara
[23:54] Sardis Philadelphia and today and L out
[23:58] of and I turned to see The Voice he
[24:00] turned to see a voice that spake with
[24:02] him cuz he was familiar with that voice
[24:04] and when he turned he was a little bit
[24:05] surprised he saw seven golden
[24:07] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[24:09] seven candlesticks one liken to the son
[24:11] of man clothed with a garment down to
[24:13] the foot and G about the paps with a
[24:16] golden girdle you may be seated the Lord
[24:17] has his Blessing to the reading of the
[24:19] word now we get started in this church
[24:22] age but as we were talking as Brother
[24:24] Richard was was ministering last week
[24:27] you look and see that this messenger of
[24:29] Malachi 4 he was to bring some things
[24:32] that people not heard before things like
[24:36] Thunders things like the opening of the
[24:39] seals uh things like the
[24:43] cloud and things like the supernatural
[24:46] picture over his head there were some
[24:48] things that they had not had back in
[24:50] that in those ages now we see no see now
[24:53] though that back then Paul irenius and
[24:55] Martin different ones but we come up now
[24:58] to we what we call is almost the modern
[25:00] age is we come into Martin Luther where
[25:03] there's going to be printing presses
[25:04] there's going to be um there's going to
[25:06] be Transportation that's a a little bit
[25:09] faster than it had been before all right
[25:12] so listen as man developed God developed
[25:16] God develops first all right develops it
[25:18] to you now not God it's the expanding of
[25:20] God to us not to him he knows who he is
[25:23] he knows how he he knows he don't have a
[25:25] limit but we have a limit all right and
[25:28] we're limited by what by our brain human
[25:31] brain all right everybody with me so
[25:33] we're going to read now Revelations 3
[25:35] this is a sardian church age this will
[25:37] be Church age number five and we're
[25:39] going to see some of the characteristics
[25:41] about this church age but we'll back up
[25:43] just a minute for the new ones that are
[25:45] here and unto the angel of the church in
[25:47] Sardis now there's an angel there's a
[25:49] messenger God's got him in his hand he
[25:51] says right here he says these things
[25:53] sayith he that hath the seven spirits of
[25:55] God and the Seven Stars which is what
[25:58] the seven Church age Messengers I Know
[26:01] Thy works that thou has has a name that
[26:03] thou livest and are dead we'll get to
[26:06] that in just a minute you got a name
[26:09] you're living by it but you're
[26:11] dead Be watchful and strengthen the
[26:14] things which remain that are ready to
[26:15] die for I have not found thy works
[26:18] perfect before God now this is God this
[26:20] is God telling John write this down and
[26:23] we're going to deliver it to this
[26:25] sardian church age okay
[26:29] remember therefore how thou Hast
[26:30] received and heard and hold fast and
[26:32] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[26:35] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[26:37] shalt not know what hour I will come
[26:39] upon thee it's getting that hour folks
[26:42] remember he's going to come as a thief
[26:44] in a night he's going to come and get
[26:45] his own and get us out of here and the
[26:49] world is not going to know it except all
[26:51] hell's going to break loose all right
[26:54] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[26:56] which have not defiled their garments
[26:57] there was all always a bride in every
[26:59] Church age and we're going to talk about
[27:01] this a little bit where that that you
[27:03] see that this was called an unfulfilled
[27:05] age when I don't just remember one thing
[27:08] it wasn't the Holy Ghost was UN
[27:09] unfulfilled the people were unfulfilled
[27:12] because you can only work the Holy Ghost
[27:14] can only work as you let him everybody
[27:16] with me that's where you can't
[27:19] understand you think God's all powerful
[27:20] God's all this God God
[27:22] is but thank God for a prophet that told
[27:25] us one day he said the Holy Ghost is
[27:26] very timid come on what it's a spirit
[27:30] and he's not going to force anything on
[27:31] you to give you your free
[27:34] will and then he will what he will work
[27:37] as you
[27:38] work all right is everybody with me thou
[27:41] Hast a few names even in Sardis which
[27:42] have not defiled their garments and they
[27:44] shall walk with me in white now look
[27:46] they shall walk with me in white that
[27:47] means they got the Holy Ghost if you are
[27:49] if anything says in the Bible about
[27:52] white robes pure and white without spot
[27:54] or wrinkle you got the holy ghost in
[27:56] your soul there by with
[27:58] all right cuz you're as perfect as God
[28:00] is as Brother Richard said you have
[28:02] already your Soul's already crossed over
[28:04] that Chasm and you spiritually are in
[28:06] Eden sometimes we need to just let that
[28:08] thing
[28:09] out what we do is we bind it so much by
[28:13] our own ideas by our own thoughts I
[28:15] don't like this one I don't like that
[28:16] one this one didn't look at me this one
[28:18] didn't somebody cut me off on the
[28:19] highway have I hit anybody
[28:22] yet I hope nobody H you thou Hast a few
[28:25] names which have not defiled their
[28:27] garment thank God in this evil age this
[28:29] Dark Age he's got a same group of people
[28:31] yes sir that is taken on his name they
[28:34] are worthy and we're to finish this
[28:36] thing up he that overcometh the same
[28:39] shall be clothed in white
[28:41] rment and I will not blot out his name
[28:43] out of the book of life but I will
[28:45] confess his name before my father before
[28:47] his angels he that hath a near let him
[28:49] hear what what the spirit
[28:51] said not what man said what the spirit
[28:55] said to the churches all right now the
[28:57] church age we're in
[28:58] now I tried to make that thing a little
[29:00] smaller but I didn't but anyway we're in
[29:02] that church age where it says Martin
[29:04] Luther the sardian church age lasted
[29:06] from 1520 to
[29:08] 1750 and we're coming into a time to
[29:11] where intelligence of man I read you
[29:13] Wednesday night the the many things that
[29:15] between Luther and Wesley's age the
[29:18] pocket watch was invented the water
[29:19] wheel the knitting machine microscope
[29:23] thermometer
[29:25] telescope submarine steam turbine adding
[29:29] machine pressure cooker
[29:33] piano steam engines lightning rods we
[29:37] know Ben Franklin did that for us
[29:39] dictionary steam ships bifocal glasses
[29:43] also Uncle Ben did the same thing for us
[29:45] he give us bifocal lenses Ben Benjamin
[29:48] Franklin parachute bicycle gas lights
[29:52] cotton genin small poox vaccine and even
[29:55] batteries
[29:58] number one was the pr and press the prin
[30:00] and press is what changed the world cuz
[30:02] you could put it in print and you could
[30:04] hand it out and then they can make
[30:06] copies and hand it out and you could
[30:08] read what somebody says instead of going
[30:10] well I think he really meant this over
[30:12] here and you made your own
[30:13] interpretation out of it but you could
[30:15] put it in print the Bible was put in
[30:17] print actually Martin Luther helped get
[30:19] it from Latin to German and compile the
[30:22] books together so everything in this
[30:25] church age is about intelligence yes all
[30:29] right we'll get to that later on not to
[30:30] not this morning but intelligence of man
[30:33] there is not a problem with the
[30:34] intelligence listen how'd y'all get here
[30:38] today just Diane you get your horse good
[30:42] okay your horse is good yall got it out
[30:44] there on the pastor eating you ready to
[30:45] go back it'll take you about two and a
[30:47] half months to get back to Tennessee
[30:49] where you live but you'll make it you'll
[30:51] be you'll be no she got in a car got
[30:53] down here about five or six
[30:56] hours that's how advanced but it started
[30:59] it had to start somewhere well let me
[31:01] tell you in the spiritual also God
[31:02] starts you really slow God starts you as
[31:06] a baby he gives you milk you take milk
[31:10] and then you go on to meet and then you
[31:12] go on to eat whatever you want to and
[31:15] maybe sometimes our
[31:17] problem but that's the fifth Church
[31:20] age and we know that it's the man
[31:23] anointing according to
[31:26] Ezekiel so the th Church Church age it
[31:28] was an ox age we already been now the
[31:31] first three Ages was the lion the second
[31:33] was the ox which is what works Ox take
[31:36] an ox outside he'll work himself to
[31:38] death all right so that's the same now
[31:40] listen you and I got to have that same
[31:42] those Spirits don't die I said the other
[31:45] day that the demon Spirits don't die
[31:47] they just migrate to another place guess
[31:49] what the Holy Ghost don't die either he
[31:52] takes and he goes from one place to
[31:54] another he goes from one Church age to
[31:55] the other and he works upon what God
[31:58] said because you're going to look at
[31:59] this you're going to see Martin Luther
[32:01] in a few minutes you're going to think
[32:02] how in the world is this guy Church a
[32:03] messenger he did a lot of
[32:06] junk but brother brandham said God was
[32:09] pleased with Martin Luther we look at it
[32:12] different Martin Luther did what God
[32:14] said maybe sometimes if we'll just do
[32:16] what God said come on and not what man
[32:20] said or what you thought you ought to do
[32:24] amen but we know every one of them every
[32:27] Church age had a dominating female
[32:31] involved in Ephesus it was Diana they
[32:34] worshiped Diana in thara they worship a
[32:37] prophetess who sat on a three-legged
[32:39] stool right father son Holy Ghost
[32:42] baptism in this church age her name was
[32:45] sael it was always a woman but this
[32:47] became a woman with a child and then as
[32:51] we read the other day then you see that
[32:53] the child goes away and now it's only
[32:56] Mary worship just like the mariology of
[32:59] in the Catholic
[33:00] church but in our age everything comes
[33:03] together and God calls it the great
[33:06] and her daughters yes all right
[33:08] plain but that's what God said I didn't
[33:11] have to interpret it it's in the Bible
[33:13] all right so Revelation 17:1 says There
[33:16] came one of the Seven Angels which had
[33:18] the seven vows now remember this is the
[33:20] seven vows so what's happened is we've
[33:22] already left the Earth the vows don't
[33:24] pour out till we're gone the vows is
[33:27] what judgement all right so we're gone
[33:30] and this is what this Angel is saying
[33:32] unto me John come hither I will show
[33:36] thee unto thee the Judgment of the great
[33:38] that sth upon many waters are many
[33:42] people we know that half this world is
[33:44] dominated by the Catholic Church which
[33:46] would be about 4 and a half billion
[33:49] people are Catholics wow with whom the
[33:53] kings of the Earth have committed
[33:55] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[33:56] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[33:59] of her
[34:00] fornication they took her
[34:02] Doctrine so he carried me away in the
[34:04] spirit to the Wilderness I saw a woman
[34:06] sitting on a Scarlet there a woman the
[34:08] church sitting on a Scarlet colored
[34:10] Beast what a power something to ride on
[34:13] full of names of blasphemy we know what
[34:15] those are having seven heads and 10
[34:17] horns that's the kingdoms in the ages
[34:20] and the woman was arrayed in purple and
[34:22] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[34:23] precious stones and Pearls having a
[34:26] golden cup in her hand what full of
[34:28] Abominations this is not the church the
[34:31] bride the bride's gone this is not even
[34:34] the foolish virgin they're not part of
[34:35] this right here now they may part of the
[34:37] system but they're not part of this
[34:39] right here because a golden cup in their
[34:41] hand full of Abominations and filthiness
[34:44] of her fornication and upon her forehead
[34:46] was a name written mystery Babylon the
[34:49] great the mother of Harlot so she was a
[34:51] great and she had Harlot children
[34:53] and Abominations of the earth and I saw
[34:56] the woman drunken with the blood of the
[34:57] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[34:59] of Jesus we just got through with the th
[35:01] tyan Church AE and when I saw her I
[35:03] wondered with great admiration in other
[35:05] words John admired this thing this thing
[35:07] she was so beautiful John gets caught up
[35:09] in it and the angel had to say hey John
[35:12] hold on buddy I'm going to show you why
[35:14] do you
[35:15] Marvel wherefore Dost thou Marvel I will
[35:19] tell thee The Mystery of the woman of
[35:21] the Beast that carrieth her which ha the
[35:23] seven heads and 10 horns the Beast thou
[35:25] sawest was and is not what one Pope dies
[35:28] one Pope comes back one Pope dies one
[35:29] Pope comes back everybody with me and
[35:32] shall Ascend out of the bottomless
[35:34] pit and go into
[35:36] predition and they that dwell on the
[35:38] Earth shall wonder whose names were not
[35:40] written in the Book of Life from the
[35:41] foundation of the world when they beheld
[35:43] the Beast that was and is not and yet is
[35:46] that's what we're coming to
[35:48] now the Bible says in Timothy but she
[35:50] that liveth in pleasure is dead amen
[35:53] dead while she liveth today if you don't
[35:55] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[35:57] your soul soul today you are dead you
[35:59] are a walking dead person talk about
[36:02] Walking Dead on the movies out there
[36:04] that's what you are you're walking dead
[36:07] all right so let's get some life in us
[36:09] get the Holy Ghost get the get the new
[36:11] birth have some life is as brother um
[36:14] Ryan was saying let's get some passion
[36:18] listen we can get some passion about
[36:22] anything we're passionate people God
[36:25] made us this way amen come on God made
[36:29] us to love God made us to love him
[36:32] though and be passionate about his word
[36:35] and like brother Ryan said be passionate
[36:37] about the things that go with it like
[36:39] studying reading coming to church being
[36:41] a Christian amen be that straight stick
[36:44] in front of that crooked
[36:46] one but if you're not born again you're
[36:49] dead I don't care if you've had signs
[36:52] wonders it doesn't matter to God Satan
[36:56] can do all that
[36:58] but Satan can't get born again Satan
[37:00] cannot have come on somebody Satan can't
[37:03] have passion for the word of God he has
[37:05] a passion for perverting the word of God
[37:08] so anytime you see that perversion H
[37:10] it's the
[37:12] devil pretty
[37:13] plain but let's have a passion for God
[37:16] and if we keep oursel in the word of God
[37:18] then God will what fulfill that passion
[37:21] listen as this age we're fixing to talk
[37:23] about is an unfulfilled age let's make
[37:26] this age a very fulfilled age and it's
[37:29] up to me and you to do that have a
[37:31] passion of what you're doing read your
[37:33] Bible with passion come to church with
[37:37] passion try smiling
[37:43] sometime some of you crack your face
[37:47] and we pray for the
[37:50] sick so now let's look here real
[37:54] quick what happened in these Church ages
[37:58] is there was a Ministry Loos in every
[38:00] Church age because I read you everyone
[38:01] Ephesus smus pergamus he came to one man
[38:05] and one man brought a message all right
[38:07] is everybody with me one man Paul
[38:10] arenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and
[38:13] brother brand everybody with me here all
[38:15] right a specific message for a specific
[38:17] time to a specific
[38:20] people cuz you can you're going to sit
[38:22] here today and you're going to look at
[38:23] your church age messenger that we looked
[38:26] at brother Brandon but you're going to
[38:27] look at Luther's Church age and you're
[38:29] going to say
[38:31] wow he was pretty he was pretty awful
[38:34] sometimes but God was pleased with that
[38:37] time don't you remember when you were a
[38:39] Christian we come up just like how God
[38:41] develops the church ages we come up the
[38:43] same way don't you remember when you
[38:44] first became a Christian that you made
[38:46] so many mistakes you stayed on your
[38:48] knees God forgive me for this forgive me
[38:51] for this for me cuz those old demons
[38:53] they don't leave they just still trying
[38:54] to pack yourself in but there's a seal
[38:57] praise God there's a seal that Satan
[39:00] can't get in and God can't get out but
[39:03] you and I have come to that but we do
[39:05] stumble we do make mistakes we take a
[39:07] baby we put her there put the baby up
[39:09] against the wall and the baby starts to
[39:11] walk when the baby falls you don't just
[39:12] start beating it do you well thank God
[39:15] God doesn't start beating us
[39:17] either but he does expect when we get
[39:20] about if we're 16 and 17 and we can
[39:23] can't can't walk am I getting to
[39:26] somebody God ought us whip
[39:29] us so the opening of the first two seals
[39:31] now what is a seal we're going to try to
[39:33] make this simple as we get into the
[39:35] layout of see in church age but remember
[39:38] a seal is seals something in or out but
[39:43] there's something written on this
[39:45] paper all right there's something
[39:47] written and it's
[39:50] important if I don't have these notes
[39:52] I'll
[39:53] stop but you see that what's on the
[39:56] outside Brother D you can't see see that
[39:57] can you can you see anything all that
[40:00] all you see is lines but something
[40:02] inside there is sealed up God sealed it
[40:06] up and Only God Can unseal it all right
[40:10] so we're going to see in Revelation 61
[40:12] and I saw when the lamb as Brother
[40:14] Richard was talking about the lamb opens
[40:16] the seal Christ is the only one that can
[40:18] open it all right because he is the seal
[40:22] all right so when he opens it guess what
[40:24] boom now you can read what's on the
[40:26] inside of it so that's what God did he
[40:28] sealed it up because of Daniel 12 he
[40:32] said Daniel seal up these things until
[40:37] what the time of the end that's right so
[40:40] they were sealed up because God said to
[40:42] seal them up yes sir but there would
[40:44] come a prophet in the end time that
[40:47] could stand there and say here stands a
[40:49] lamb with a book and there goes a white
[40:50] horse rider he has come to a place to
[40:52] where God was using him so much
[40:55] swallow do you couldn't tell the
[41:01] difference but what did these do what
[41:03] did it do it loosed a Ministry at loose
[41:07] so that something can be said yes sir
[41:10] we've read the Bible for years and years
[41:12] and years and years and for those of us
[41:14] that were trinitarians we read it as a
[41:16] trinitarian Bible exactly but the seal
[41:20] wasn't really tore off of it we were
[41:21] just reading words on a on a page yes
[41:25] sir but these these animals these four
[41:29] beasts are the lion at first reading
[41:32] Ezekiel you see it's a face of a man
[41:34] face of an ox face of a lion face of an
[41:36] eagle everybody with me all right so
[41:38] we're in the Bible but it's come to the
[41:40] age where we can understand that all
[41:42] right so Revelation 6 verse one said
[41:44] when I saw and I saw now that's John
[41:46] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[41:48] and I heard as it were the noise of
[41:49] Thunder one of the four Beast lion the
[41:53] lion said come and see and I Behold a
[41:56] white horse he that sat on him had a bow
[41:58] and a crown was given unto him and he
[42:00] went forth conquering and to conquer now
[42:03] we know for a fact that who that was
[42:05] that was the Antichrist starting in the
[42:08] first church age under the opice of a
[42:10] white righteous
[42:12] Church seeming white there was a white
[42:15] righteous Church Paul irenius and Martin
[42:18] they they develop or brought that group
[42:20] together called The Bride but then Satan
[42:22] he gets on his horse or what gets on his
[42:25] power and he starts riding but remember
[42:28] at the first church age he doesn't have
[42:29] a lot of power because there's more
[42:31] power in the lion l in the lion which is
[42:35] bold that's Paul arenus Martin the
[42:37] different ones they didn't have to
[42:39] muddle through denominations they didn't
[42:40] have to they didn't have a big Catholic
[42:42] Church over their head it was coming yes
[42:46] it was coming in very in very small
[42:48] amounts but it had not come to his Apex
[42:50] or come to his head all
[42:52] right and he got on his horse and he had
[42:54] a bow oh it look like See's a bluff he
[42:57] looked like he was strong but he had
[42:59] nothing same way
[43:02] today and a crown was given he didn't
[43:05] even have a crown itself Crown who
[43:07] crowned him the people the people
[43:10] crowned him it's our situation God's
[43:13] give us we're going to Crown Him king of
[43:15] kings and Lord of lords is that not what
[43:17] the Bible says we're going to Crown Him
[43:18] amen and we're going to get
[43:21] crowned and he went forth conquering and
[43:23] to conquer so the first three AG Three
[43:26] Ages
[43:27] Satan bluffed his way into the true
[43:29] white righteous
[43:31] church and God allowed that to happen
[43:35] because we're going to read the
[43:35] scripture this afternoon where God
[43:37] promised that the corn of wheat had to
[43:38] go in the ground all right if this is
[43:42] not exciting y'all y'all need to wake up
[43:43] and um we'll find something else to
[43:46] do okay this is what we're
[43:53] doing Revelation 6 now verse three and
[43:57] when he had opened the second seal now
[43:58] what was the second beast it was an ox
[44:02] what we've been talking about in the
[44:03] Thon Church age or the work the work
[44:06] horse or the work Ox this was the ox age
[44:10] and John saw this beast and that Beast
[44:13] said hey come and see what's behind this
[44:16] seal all right and then went out another
[44:18] horse all right now look Satan got off
[44:20] of one and got on another
[44:23] one but that white that White Horse He
[44:26] said kept running running cuz that power
[44:29] of that white righteous church just kept
[44:30] going cuz remember it's going to it's
[44:32] going to uh culminate in the world
[44:35] Council of
[44:38] churches cuz it looks
[44:40] good it looks
[44:44] righteous
[44:47] looks looks can be deceiving somebody
[44:49] ought to somebody ought to make that a
[44:51] quote and they went on another horse
[44:53] that was red now he gets on another
[44:55] horse this horse is a different color
[44:58] cuz this horse has a different the the
[45:00] messenger setting on the horse which is
[45:02] Satan he has he's getting ready to loose
[45:05] another Ministry or one that's a little
[45:08] bit higher than the one he had because
[45:09] the one he had didn't have a lot of
[45:11] power he had a bow and no arrows that's
[45:13] right but now we come up to this church
[45:15] age now what what happened power was
[45:17] given unto him that set their own to
[45:19] take peace from the earth and they
[45:21] should kill one another and there was
[45:22] given to him a
[45:25] sword ah he's got a sword or a word that
[45:29] he can cut the people with
[45:32] absolutely I like the one that says
[45:34] sharp two-edged sword that cuts
[45:37] me but there was one that came in this
[45:39] church age which is the fourth Church
[45:41] age which is th tying Church age he was
[45:44] given a sword or a word so then we go to
[45:47] the nasan council we have all different
[45:49] councils and they all come together and
[45:51] they they they you know they come out
[45:53] with a trinitarian Doctrine they came
[45:55] out with a name that you called but
[45:56] you're
[45:57] they come out with all these different
[45:58] things all these different uh
[46:00] denominations are fixing the head up
[46:03] we'll read about that in a little while
[46:04] because remember everything has a
[46:06] beginning everything is a seed all right
[46:09] that seed has to grow the the
[46:11] denominational seed started growing in
[46:13] the first church age but it was so small
[46:15] nobody worried about it at the time
[46:19] everybody with me but now we come up to
[46:21] Columbus age and we come up to where
[46:23] that that that the Roman Catholic Church
[46:25] is fixing to start dominating
[46:27] they're fixing to put what they put
[46:29] church and state Church wasn't very it
[46:31] church was
[46:33] weak but when Constantine give him give
[46:36] them an army do you know the Vatican has
[46:39] their own
[46:39] Army and it's huge people just don't
[46:42] know about it and they're everywhere but
[46:44] Vatican has their own Army and their own
[46:46] protection of of the Vatican their own
[46:51] self but let's look here just a second
[46:54] there was given him a word a great
[46:58] sword and that was the red horse rider
[47:00] or the second horse and what went out to
[47:03] combat it an ox of work labor keep going
[47:06] God said keep going keep going now let's
[47:09] go to the second seal this brother R
[47:12] preached in 1963 when the slain risen
[47:14] lamb opened it and the second calf life
[47:17] like Beast said come and see what the
[47:19] seal mystery is now we get to it the
[47:22] lamb you remember has to open every seal
[47:24] so if you don't understand anything
[47:26] understand this
[47:27] Christ was there that week with brother
[47:29] brandham opening those seals sir all
[47:32] right he was the one brother brand got
[47:34] out of the way so much he said I've
[47:36] never worked in Realms like this before
[47:38] read the seal book he was just AED at
[47:41] the things that that he didn't see until
[47:44] Christ came on the scene and said hey
[47:45] this this this this and that's the
[47:48] Perfection of the word of God only Jesus
[47:51] Christ can keep it
[47:53] together that's why if you don't have
[47:54] the Holy Ghost you're not going to
[47:55] understand a word we're saying
[47:58] oh yeah maybe you know get saved and
[48:00] baptized
[48:03] and and the second beast if you notice
[48:06] in the routine of where we just went
[48:07] through the church ages the first was a
[48:09] lion as we said before the next was a
[48:12] was a calf or ox or something you see
[48:15] and this Beast said come and see now
[48:16] when the lamb opened the seal and then
[48:18] John went to see now remember John toed
[48:21] the
[48:23] bride I'm telling you today come and see
[48:27] if you're bride you will be able to see
[48:29] it you will hear the call listen folks
[48:32] that's the
[48:33] Thunder the Thunder is the voice of God
[48:36] when the seal breaks to you when you
[48:37] realize who you are what you're doing
[48:40] here why you're here what stage you're
[48:42] at where you need to be you're God L by
[48:45] then you're not demon
[48:49] POS look at where we're at
[48:51] folks if you'll just listen don't worry
[48:54] about seals and Thunders yeah you need
[48:56] to worry about but just it's simply
[48:58] brother Brown said it was a life lived
[49:00] is the greatest Thunder that's the devil
[49:02] the devil can't stand that so John tying
[49:05] the bride the the the ox said hey John
[49:09] come see I want you to see what's going
[49:11] on well that's God calling us hey hey
[49:14] hey I want you to see I want you to see
[49:17] this deceiver yes and what he's doing to
[49:20] the world and then I'm going to read in
[49:23] just a little while he turns around and
[49:24] says come out of that my people have you
[49:27] come out of it that's my question to all
[49:29] of us have we come out of this
[49:32] thing as Brother Richard said out of the
[49:34] true church they'll come a
[49:36] bride the two seeds in the framework of
[49:39] this
[49:42] church if that's deceiving you you're
[49:45] already
[49:47] deceived and you're
[49:50] done cuz when we get to that third poll
[49:53] and we talk about brother Brown had the
[49:54] three polls we're talking about the
[49:57] second poll now brother Richard said but
[49:58] the third poll is here speaking to
[50:01] people that are totally
[50:02] lost I hate that but that's what he
[50:05] said so when he walked in what happened
[50:08] let's let's see what he found come see
[50:11] there's a mystery sealed up here that's
[50:14] been here now for 2,000 years about now
[50:16] we see what it is now we find here that
[50:18] we saw a red horse go forward I continue
[50:22] reading now they should kill one another
[50:25] they should kill each other his bow had
[50:27] no arrows at first remember in the first
[50:29] three Church AG his bow had no arrows he
[50:32] was a bluff he bluffed his way through
[50:34] the whole
[50:35] thing but his sword did he done his
[50:39] killing later and changed from a white
[50:41] horse to a red horse the same exact
[50:44] Devil with his sword what Jesus say
[50:48] Jesus said they that take the sword will
[50:49] perish by it he said don't fight talking
[50:52] about Peter Jesus that night when Peter
[50:55] cut that guy's ear off he said Peter put
[50:57] your sword up we're not fighting with
[50:59] that kind of Sword no more but Peter on
[51:01] the day of Pentecost he stood up with
[51:03] the sword of God
[51:06] yes he had the Holy Ghost then he put
[51:09] that sword out and he said oh my you've
[51:12] killed Jesus Christ and they said men
[51:15] and Brethren what can we do and he said
[51:17] repent and be baptized what they were
[51:19] pricked that passion came out in their
[51:23] heart now remember he's got a sword he's
[51:26] going for a sword in his hand riding a
[51:28] red horse waiting through the blood of
[51:30] everybody that disagrees with him now do
[51:34] you understand it how many understand
[51:36] what that seal is now what is it it's
[51:38] that middle Church age it's that th tyan
[51:41] Church age that where they killed 68
[51:43] million
[51:45] Christians put them in the ground and as
[51:48] Josh looked up for him one more time
[51:49] that was the whole state of California
[51:51] and Texas the two biggest states one of
[51:53] the two biggest states in the United
[51:54] States wiped every person out this those
[51:56] two states that's how much the Roman
[51:59] Catholic kill people 68 million people
[52:02] that would be all of California all of
[52:04] Texas do away with every person in it
[52:06] right now and that's how many they
[52:07] killed in 900
[52:09] years and they were
[52:14] Christians all right this writer and all
[52:16] his kingdom subjects that are slain down
[52:19] Through the Ages that draw all this
[52:20] Blood of the martyrs of the Saints will
[52:22] be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ
[52:24] when he comes that's where the bows are
[52:25] going to be poured out out they took the
[52:28] sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut
[52:30] down the real true worshippers all down
[52:33] Through the Ages by the millions and
[52:34] when Christ comes with a sword which is
[52:36] the word he will slay every enemy there
[52:39] is before him but now who is that and
[52:41] where is
[52:44] he Christ is here and this is the sword
[52:47] he's going to use why we looking for
[52:49] something else you think he's going to
[52:51] stand on the Mount of Olives with this
[52:52] great big sword and just go right on
[52:54] through no he's doing it now yes sir
[52:57] he's going to do it through two prophets
[53:00] he's going to do it through the word of
[53:01] God that's his
[53:03] sword he doesn't need a sword like
[53:07] this his sword is the word of God you
[53:10] might have killed 68 million of them
[53:12] down through these ages maybe more but
[53:14] Jesus said he that takes the sword will
[53:17] perish by it watch as the imposters
[53:19] against the word of God and because they
[53:21] didn't agree and this thing Satan placed
[53:23] United the political power which is
[53:25] Constantine iCal power which he held and
[53:28] the spiritual power which he held put
[53:29] them both together and made a church
[53:31] that sweeps into every nation he's put
[53:33] Millions times Millions after he jumped
[53:36] off his white horse on Red he took his
[53:38] sword and went forth but God said with
[53:40] the same thing that he
[53:41] perverted the false teaching that same
[53:44] word will rise in power I say it's
[53:46] rising now it's cutting it's pulling
[53:50] it's pushing we're going to get out of
[53:52] here but we're not going to get out of
[53:53] here with all this Dogma we're not get
[53:55] out here with all his baggage hanging
[53:58] on y'all get happy if you want to but
[54:00] I'll just get happy right
[54:04] here cuz I'm happy to be a part of it
[54:06] I'm happy to be able to see that Satan's
[54:08] got a store that Satan is out there he's
[54:10] out there I say he's out there he's
[54:12] right
[54:15] here cuz look coming from the lips of
[54:17] Jesus Christ and it shall slay him and
[54:20] everything before him amen there's your
[54:22] second seal now let's go to the third
[54:24] seal now what was he given them first he
[54:25] was given to B but he didn't have an
[54:27] arrow now he's got a mighty sword in his
[54:29] hand he can do something now he jumps
[54:31] off his White Horse white horse rides on
[54:34] remember the right White Horse keeps
[54:35] going that power keeps going on now
[54:37] straddles a what a red horse blood blood
[54:40] red horse he really rides that one oh
[54:41] sure CU remember that's the longest
[54:43] Church age 900 years he's given great
[54:46] power and a great sword to kill then he
[54:47] rides his blood red horse why listen I
[54:52] want ask you a question why' God allow
[54:53] this to happen
[54:57] you ever ask yourself a question God why
[54:59] we why you have you ever asked God why
[55:00] you got to go through what you're going
[55:05] through oh those of you that are all
[55:07] sainted and don't ever question God we
[55:10] we'll have second service for y'all to
[55:11] be in the altar before we take communion
[55:13] cuz you're
[55:14] lying well hello
[55:17] somebody listen we all got we all
[55:21] question we question things but once we
[55:25] get to the part where we we say but
[55:27] Lord as brother Lis was preaching but
[55:30] God but God steps on the scene I promise
[55:34] you if you're his child he'll tell you
[55:36] why you going through that he'll tell
[55:38] you why and he'll show you why it will
[55:41] Define you it will not destroy you if
[55:44] you're a real true
[55:46] Christian he takes peace from the earth
[55:48] and killed one another in his own
[55:49] modology of Roman Catholic said they put
[55:51] 68 million Protestants to death from the
[55:55] time of St atin of Hippo until 1580 68
[55:59] million and it's recorded So I mean it's
[56:02] not
[56:04] hearsay now remember he gets his power
[56:06] because he becomes the viker of heaven
[56:08] and worshiped his God ruler of the Earth
[56:10] by uniting the church and state Together
[56:12] made him ruler on Earth give him a crown
[56:14] over that he could pray the souls out of
[56:17] purgatory he could also in other words
[56:20] intercede he was just like God on Earth
[56:23] instead of God you see how perverted
[56:25] that is because you know what you and I
[56:26] are the same thing but we are
[56:29] God we are representatives of God if you
[56:32] have the new birth listen the pope
[56:34] didn't have the new birth all
[56:37] right you've got the new birth you
[56:39] listen you and I today we have the power
[56:42] that Satan's looking
[56:44] for come on somebody we have the power
[56:47] that Satan's looking for he's want to do
[56:50] it with this do it with political he's
[56:51] trying to get so
[56:54] big he can whip God
[56:57] hello yes sir he's trying to get so big
[56:59] put I he's got the
[57:03] world he's got 99% of the people in the
[57:05] world but he's after us why because we
[57:09] won't take his
[57:11] garbage I hope you don't take his
[57:16] garbage the church can't say nothing
[57:18] he's head of IT State can't say nothing
[57:20] he's head of that so they died by the
[57:22] millions all the little churches brother
[57:24] was busted up killed murdered fed the
[57:26] Lions and everything else the dragon
[57:28] Rome gave him his seat and Authority the
[57:30] Bible said so so he rode his typed red
[57:32] horse through human blood till it became
[57:36] a red horse with
[57:39] blood Matthew 6 ver
[57:41] 23 but if thine eye be evil thy whole
[57:44] body shall be full of
[57:46] Darkness if therefore the light that is
[57:48] in thee be Darkness how great is that
[57:50] Darkness listen the Roman Catholic
[57:52] Church they thought they were it Satan's
[57:55] got them so so confused remember what
[57:57] God told us I I in Timothy or somewhere
[58:00] he says he says I'm going to let him
[58:02] believe this
[58:05] lie I'm going to let them believe it and
[58:07] be damned by it but they're going to
[58:09] think it's you you don't think the
[58:11] Catholic church is going to try to take
[58:12] over the world just so that they can all
[58:14] fall apart no they want all the gold
[58:17] they want your mind they want your kids
[58:19] they want your right right they want all
[58:22] that cuz they think what they have is
[58:25] light yeah yeah but Satan's got him so
[58:27] deceived I want to ask you a question
[58:29] are we so deceived that the thing we
[58:31] think is light is actually killing us if
[58:35] you don't get a true revelation of this
[58:37] message not this church not spoken word
[58:40] church this church The Message Church
[58:43] the Believers the bride amen if you
[58:46] don't get a true Revelation that you are
[58:48] in darkness come
[58:52] on what do you think about those people
[58:54] like Tim Humes I'll call his name
[58:55] because
[58:57] you see how much damage he's done he
[58:59] thought he had
[59:01] light now he says that that wasn't light
[59:04] that light is over here we should get
[59:07] away from the prophet light's over here
[59:10] denounced everything in the message well
[59:12] that light that he thinks he has is
[59:16] Darkness it's going to kill him
[59:19] physically and spiritually maybe but
[59:21] definitely
[59:22] spiritually so now it's getting a
[59:24] sardian church age just for a few
[59:25] minutes
[59:27] now look what God said he said I Know
[59:28] Thy Works thou has a name that thou
[59:30] livest and art dead remember the first
[59:32] three Church ages the baptism was name
[59:35] in the Lord Jesus Christ the correct
[59:36] name we were bride we knew who the Lord
[59:39] Jesus was he was one God he wasn't three
[59:43] he didn't have three personalities he
[59:45] didn't come different from God he was
[59:48] God all
[59:52] rightall but this group of people had a
[59:55] different idea
[59:57] they took the name out and put father
[59:59] son Holy Ghost they took the name out
[1:00:00] and put Pope in they took the name out
[1:00:03] and put Cardinals and Bishops and all
[1:00:05] that I Know Thy Works thou has a name
[1:00:08] thou livest and you're dead Be watchful
[1:00:10] and strengthen the things which remain
[1:00:13] that are ready to die for I have not
[1:00:14] found thy Works see he's fixing to
[1:00:16] rebuke the ones even that have light he
[1:00:20] said I have not found thy works perfect
[1:00:22] before
[1:00:24] God you have a few names even in Sardis
[1:00:27] which have not defiled their
[1:00:29] garments and they shall walk with me in
[1:00:31] white for they're
[1:00:35] worthy so the combat Beast as we were
[1:00:37] seeing before brother Brown told us now
[1:00:39] that there was a lion in the first three
[1:00:41] ages there was an ox in that middle age
[1:00:43] where it says Columba right there get up
[1:00:45] here a little bit higher we can see it
[1:00:47] right and then now we're into the third
[1:00:51] creature which is the man which is
[1:00:54] intelligence all right we'll read what
[1:00:56] brother R said about that maybe this
[1:00:57] afternoon the intelligence of man is
[1:01:01] always contrary to the intelligence of
[1:01:04] God that's right okay you see that word
[1:01:06] knowledge right there that word
[1:01:07] knowledge is God knowledge that's not
[1:01:09] knowledge that you can add and subtract
[1:01:11] and tell who so and so is no that's Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost knowledge brother R said to know
[1:01:16] what's right and wrong to know what to
[1:01:18] believe and not to believe all right cuz
[1:01:21] remember if you're not
[1:01:23] sealed you're going to be deceived
[1:01:30] you're going to be deceived if you're
[1:01:32] not sealed if you don't have the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost you're already deceived but come
[1:01:35] out of her my people come out of that
[1:01:37] deception amen that's why brother R said
[1:01:40] the the the most important thing for us
[1:01:42] to do is get the new birth know we got
[1:01:44] the new birth not just a feeling not
[1:01:46] just an emotion that's
[1:01:48] Satan Satan can pass out well I spoke in
[1:01:50] tongu well so did
[1:01:53] Satan you remember the people says have
[1:01:55] I not healed the sick have I not raised
[1:01:57] the dead have I not preached your in
[1:01:59] your name and Jesus said what depart
[1:02:01] from me you never had a birth you never
[1:02:04] were part of my family you were part of
[1:02:06] a family but you were so deceived that
[1:02:09] light inside of you is Darkness if you
[1:02:11] don't see the True
[1:02:13] Light that's why it's important to see
[1:02:15] truth it's important to see truth and
[1:02:18] know that what the why are we bound why
[1:02:21] are we
[1:02:24] bound Jesus said said You shall know the
[1:02:27] truth and the truth shall set you free
[1:02:32] let's go back to the truth part amen
[1:02:35] what's your passion like brother Ryan
[1:02:36] said what you what you passionate about
[1:02:39] what does your conscience feed on what
[1:02:40] are you feeding
[1:02:42] on come on somebody get quiet now that's
[1:02:46] okay but this church age lasted from
[1:02:49] 1520 to 1750 and like I said before I
[1:02:51] read to you all the things that came uh
[1:02:54] the the nation of of America was was
[1:02:57] getting ready to be formed uh it had
[1:02:59] already been established so America uh
[1:03:02] 1776 is when we got our independence so
[1:03:05] it's coming into the age of Wesley but
[1:03:06] that all Luther and Wesley Luther was a
[1:03:08] German so it was over there remember
[1:03:10] brother R said it was there went across
[1:03:12] the over the canal to Wesley which was
[1:03:15] Englishman and then it comes over here
[1:03:17] remember Wesley actually came over here
[1:03:19] to Georgia
[1:03:23] actually so let's look at it real quick
[1:03:25] what we were talking about the other day
[1:03:26] about six weeks or so ago what does a
[1:03:29] messenger do when that messenger comes
[1:03:31] on the scene Luther come on the saying
[1:03:34] he condemned all that that was back this
[1:03:36] way that had turned away from God all
[1:03:38] right then what did he do he rebukes the
[1:03:40] previous age like I said and then he
[1:03:42] what he brings a message like I said
[1:03:44] there's something loosed in Luther's
[1:03:46] message there was a message that was
[1:03:48] loosed there had never been seen before
[1:03:50] now it had been seen back
[1:03:52] here but it had been so eroded it had
[1:03:56] been so much believe the Catholic Church
[1:03:58] believe in Works believe in penants
[1:04:01] yes but when he come out he he he looked
[1:04:04] at the Bible and he one the Bible wasn't
[1:04:07] written he just brought the manuscripts
[1:04:08] together and he looked he said the just
[1:04:12] shall live by
[1:04:14] faith what a
[1:04:17] message now remember that word Sardis
[1:04:20] means Escape ones the religion was the
[1:04:23] mother and son worship which is SA and
[1:04:25] de us at first but remember brother R
[1:04:29] said look all these characteristics he
[1:04:31] was up here and she was like right here
[1:04:33] but when we come to the End of the Age
[1:04:35] it
[1:04:37] shifts like I said about that book I was
[1:04:39] telling you to read about the 50 years
[1:04:41] in the Catholic
[1:04:44] Church they start out they put a kid
[1:04:46] they they have that's why they bring
[1:04:47] kids into
[1:04:49] monasteries of course they do some awful
[1:04:51] things to them you know that but they
[1:04:53] bring the kids in to teach them the
[1:04:54] Catholic way and then they he said they
[1:04:57] sat down with me I was 7 years old the
[1:04:59] guy that wrote this book he said the
[1:05:02] priest sat down with me and
[1:05:03] said who' youd rather talk to your mama
[1:05:06] or your
[1:05:07] daddy oh my mama cuz my daddy's
[1:05:10] me oh when you need something who do you
[1:05:13] go to I go to Mama Daddy's me uh who you
[1:05:17] need to talk about this now I go to Mama
[1:05:19] I go to Mama I go to Mama so then he
[1:05:22] starts saying well Mary Mary's the you
[1:05:25] need to pray to because Jesus is
[1:05:28] mean you see how that just develops so
[1:05:31] much just like
[1:05:32] us or what who are you more comfortable
[1:05:35] that's what who are you more comfortable
[1:05:36] with your mother or your father well I'm
[1:05:38] more comfortable with my mother cuz my
[1:05:40] dad he's mean sometimes you know or he
[1:05:42] whips me a little bit harder than Mama
[1:05:44] does and Mama when you get sick who do
[1:05:46] you go to you see how that is now listen
[1:05:49] that sounds pretty
[1:05:51] good but but if you're sick who do you
[1:05:53] oh mama just rocks me and cra me you
[1:05:56] know kid 7 years old but he's writing it
[1:05:58] now at 60 years old is how they did that
[1:06:01] in the Catholic church to get him to
[1:06:03] worship Mary and not Jesus CU Jesus is
[1:06:06] mean Mary's sweet so we're going to the
[1:06:08] mother of God we're going to worship her
[1:06:11] first CU Jesus is
[1:06:13] mean sounds good but it's the
[1:06:17] devil the mother has literally taken the
[1:06:20] place of the son endowed with the merits
[1:06:22] of God do you know round about this time
[1:06:25] that a gets up and he says I believe
[1:06:27] Mary was
[1:06:29] resurrected cuz we can't find her
[1:06:33] body and she ascended to heaven and
[1:06:36] she's up there now and that's who you
[1:06:37] pray to Mary no Mary had to go to
[1:06:41] Pentecost absolutely Mary had to get the
[1:06:44] new birth yes sir she birthed the word
[1:06:46] but she had to birth the word inside of
[1:06:47] her soul yes
[1:06:50] sir the mother has literally taken place
[1:06:52] of the son endowed with the Merit of
[1:06:54] godhead all one needs to do is go over
[1:06:57] her various titles and recall the lovely
[1:06:59] attributes according Mary by the Roman
[1:07:01] Church to understand where the religion
[1:07:03] of this age came from
[1:07:07] Wow Let's through now watch but what did
[1:07:11] Luther
[1:07:13] do Luther during that time he
[1:07:15] crystallized the doctrine of
[1:07:16] justification by faith that they held to
[1:07:19] Works penances prayers and other
[1:07:22] unscriptural means and as to Freed
[1:07:24] Christians glorify the son the Roman
[1:07:27] Catholics increased their increased
[1:07:28] their deification of Mary like I said
[1:07:30] before until the 20th century saw in
[1:07:32] opposition to most even high ranking
[1:07:35] Roman
[1:07:36] theologist that Pope P literally exalted
[1:07:39] Mary to glorification in a resurrected
[1:07:41] body now they believe that that's why
[1:07:44] you see the Blessed Virgin Mary you know
[1:07:46] he got this big heart you know and if he
[1:07:48] do if if she is holding the baby she's
[1:07:50] got a Halo just like he's
[1:07:53] got that Doctrine is absolutely the
[1:07:56] babylonius doctrine of the son carrying
[1:07:58] the mother bodily into
[1:08:01] heaven wow Martin Luther let's talk
[1:08:04] about him just for a second then we'll
[1:08:06] recap this this
[1:08:07] afternoon Martin Luther was born in 1483
[1:08:10] died 1546 he was 62 years old when he
[1:08:13] passed but he was a
[1:08:15] German all right he was a priest
[1:08:17] Theologian author he wrote hymns he was
[1:08:20] a professor and an augustinian frier cuz
[1:08:22] remember Luther was in that system amen
[1:08:25] andbody with me Luther came in under the
[1:08:27] cath Catholic system
[1:08:30] yes he was actually like a um it was a
[1:08:34] Fri but but he couldn't marry cuz now at
[1:08:36] this time they said no priest can't
[1:08:38] marry he broke that up but he was the
[1:08:41] seminal figure of the Protestant
[1:08:43] Reformation you know why that's called
[1:08:45] Protestant right because they protested
[1:08:48] the Catholic Church all right Luther was
[1:08:51] the seminal figure of the Protestant re
[1:08:53] reformation and his theological belief
[1:08:56] form the basis of Lutheranism he is
[1:08:58] widely regarded as one of the most
[1:09:00] influential figures in Western and
[1:09:01] Christian history brother R will agree
[1:09:03] with that he's one of the most important
[1:09:05] one because it was so marred it's just
[1:09:07] like you put something in a pit of
[1:09:09] tar and there's one finger sticking
[1:09:13] out and Luther reaches and gets that one
[1:09:16] finger and he pulls the church out of
[1:09:17] that just by one finger now listen they
[1:09:20] still Tire on
[1:09:21] it but at least he pulled them out all
[1:09:24] right Luther was ordained in the
[1:09:26] priesthood in 1507 he came to reject
[1:09:28] several teachings and practices of the
[1:09:30] Roman Catholic
[1:09:31] Church you in particular he disputed the
[1:09:34] view of indulgences Luther attempted to
[1:09:36] resolve these differences amicably but
[1:09:39] first proposing an academic discussion
[1:09:42] well that got him in
[1:09:45] trouble he put those 95 Theses up and
[1:09:48] they everyone was against the Catholic
[1:09:49] Church Pope Leo demanded that Luther
[1:09:51] renounce all of his writings and when
[1:09:53] Luther refused he excommunicated him in
[1:09:55] January
[1:09:57] 1521 then they actually they sent people
[1:10:00] to kill him they sent people to kill
[1:10:03] Martin Luther and they couldn't get to
[1:10:05] him listen God's not going to if he's
[1:10:08] not finished with you you're not going
[1:10:09] to die all right Luther taught that
[1:10:12] salvation and consequently eternal life
[1:10:14] are not earned by Good Deeds rather they
[1:10:16] are received only as the free gift of
[1:10:18] God's grace through the believer's faith
[1:10:20] in Jesus Christ who is the sole Redeemer
[1:10:22] from sin see that put him in trouble
[1:10:24] right there because there's saying the
[1:10:25] pope is
[1:10:28] right but he had enough gra he had
[1:10:30] enough power about him he but listen he
[1:10:33] had enough intelligence too to do it the
[1:10:35] right
[1:10:38] way Luther's theology challenged the
[1:10:41] authority and Office of the Pope by
[1:10:42] teaching that the Bible is the only
[1:10:44] source of divinely revealed knowledge
[1:10:47] Luther's translation of the Bible into
[1:10:48] German from Latin made the Bible vastly
[1:10:50] more accessible to the Ley remember
[1:10:53] Catholic Church even today they do
[1:10:55] everything in
[1:10:56] Latin they you don't read the Bible you
[1:10:58] just depend on the
[1:11:00] pope which had tremendous impact on both
[1:11:03] the church in German culture it fostered
[1:11:05] the development of a standard version of
[1:11:06] the German language added several
[1:11:09] principles to the art of translation and
[1:11:11] influenced the writing of an English
[1:11:12] translation or the tendale Bible you
[1:11:14] know what happened to tendale right they
[1:11:17] hooked him behind a horse and they drug
[1:11:18] him till he K till they killed him just
[1:11:20] because he put a Bible together his
[1:11:23] hymns influenced the development of
[1:11:24] singing in the in the Protestant
[1:11:26] churches cuz remember that wasn't in the
[1:11:28] Catholic Church you see how much he's
[1:11:30] he's reformed or pulling the people out
[1:11:32] and getting them to where even our
[1:11:33] worship now cuz what happened to Wesley
[1:11:37] Wesley had a method of
[1:11:39] worship right that's why it's called
[1:11:41] Methodist there was a method but it
[1:11:43] started with Martin Luther singing songs
[1:11:45] and remember he gets married to this
[1:11:48] cathina Von Bora she was a nun well that
[1:11:52] just tore the Catholic Church up a
[1:11:54] priest mared a nun
[1:11:56] set a model for the practice of clerical
[1:11:59] M marriage allowing Protestant clergy to
[1:12:02] marry so you see how he's pulled that
[1:12:04] out but remember he's not going to pull
[1:12:06] it all the way out he's not going to
[1:12:09] pull it all the way out everybody with
[1:12:10] me some of you are some of you not in
[1:12:14] two later works Luther expressed
[1:12:15] anti-jewish Fusion now see he called for
[1:12:18] the Jews to be expelled or experss or
[1:12:22] done away burning of synagogues these
[1:12:25] works also targeted Roman Catholics
[1:12:27] anabaptists and non-trinitarian
[1:12:28] Christians based upon his teachings
[1:12:31] despite the fact that Luther did not
[1:12:33] Advocate the murdering of Jews some
[1:12:35] historians contend that his rhetoric
[1:12:37] contributed to the development see how
[1:12:39] Satan gets in yes Satan just died right
[1:12:42] in he said oh Luther I see a crack and
[1:12:45] he inserted himself right in there and
[1:12:46] started what happened was the Nazi party
[1:12:49] came from because he was a German
[1:12:51] Germans hated the Jews well that
[1:12:53] continued from Luther all the way to
[1:12:55] what did that demon do that demon went
[1:12:57] right into Adolf Hitler Luther dedic him
[1:13:01] dedicated himself to the augustinian
[1:13:03] order devoted himself to fasting long
[1:13:05] hours in prayer listen he wasn't a
[1:13:08] scoundrel he was a Godly
[1:13:11] Man pilgrimage and frequent confessions
[1:13:13] Luther described this period of his life
[1:13:15] as one of deep spiritual despair watch
[1:13:17] what he said I lost touch with Christ
[1:13:19] the Savior and com comforter and made of
[1:13:22] him the Jailer and hangman of my poor
[1:13:23] Saul
[1:13:27] this is his letter to the Pope I like
[1:13:29] this I want to read it again this is a
[1:13:32] direct letter he wrote this and sent it
[1:13:34] to Pope whatever Leo the 10th I believe
[1:13:35] it was the first and chief article is
[1:13:38] this Jesus Christ Our God and Lord died
[1:13:40] for our sins and was raised again for
[1:13:42] our
[1:13:43] justification Romans 3 he alone is the
[1:13:46] Lamb of God who takes away the sins of
[1:13:47] the world well that got him in trouble
[1:13:49] right there and God has laid on him the
[1:13:51] iniquity of us all all have sinned in
[1:13:54] our Justified freely without their own
[1:13:56] works and merits well that got away from
[1:13:58] the Catholic Church by his grace through
[1:14:00] the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[1:14:02] in his blood Romans 3 this is necessary
[1:14:05] to believe this cannot be otherwise
[1:14:07] acquired or grasped by any work law or
[1:14:10] Merit therefore it is clear and certain
[1:14:13] that this faith alone justifies us
[1:14:15] nothing of this article can be yielded
[1:14:17] or surrendered in other words I'm not
[1:14:19] changing it I'm writing it to the pope
[1:14:22] and if he kills me I he just kills me
[1:14:26] even though Heaven and Earth and
[1:14:28] everything else
[1:14:30] Falls now this is the letter he wrote to
[1:14:32] his
[1:14:34] followers in these sermons he hammered
[1:14:37] home the primary the pracy of core
[1:14:39] Christian values such as love patience
[1:14:41] charity freedom and reminded the
[1:14:43] citizens to trust God's word rather than
[1:14:45] violence to bring about necessary change
[1:14:49] do you know what the devil thinks when
[1:14:50] he sees men use violence to propagate
[1:14:52] the gospel he sits with folded arms arms
[1:14:55] behind the fire of hell and says with
[1:14:57] malignant look and frightful grin oh how
[1:15:00] wise these Mad Men are to play my
[1:15:02] game ain't that what we
[1:15:05] do oh how wise these Mad Men are to play
[1:15:08] my game let them go on I shall reap the
[1:15:11] benefits I Delight in
[1:15:13] it but when he sees the word running and
[1:15:16] contending alone on the battlefield then
[1:15:18] he shutters and shakes for fear real
[1:15:22] quick right here we got to look at this
[1:15:24] as the Reformation or the age of
[1:15:27] reforming this was not this listen just
[1:15:30] for a minute this began the age of
[1:15:33] restoration do you understand me that
[1:15:34] but it wasn't yet restored we'll read
[1:15:38] we'll talk about that this afternoon cuz
[1:15:41] Joel says I will restore this is not a
[1:15:44] restoring this is the Reformation he's
[1:15:46] restoring
[1:15:52] now Luther was a mighty preacher and
[1:15:54] teacher of the word word and insisted
[1:15:55] especially in his first years of public
[1:15:57] imminence that the word was the sole
[1:16:00] Criterion thus he was against works as
[1:16:02] the means of Salvation and baptism as a
[1:16:04] means of regeneration he talked of
[1:16:06] mediation of Christ apart from man as
[1:16:09] was the original and Pentecostal concept
[1:16:12] he was a man given to much prayer and
[1:16:13] had learned that more the work he did
[1:16:15] the more solely he sorely he was
[1:16:17] impressed for time more of his time he
[1:16:19] gave to God In Prayer in order to ensure
[1:16:21] satisfactory results he was passionate
[1:16:24] about what he was doing
[1:16:26] he knew what it was to battle with the
[1:16:28] devil and said that Satan one day
[1:16:29] visibly appeared to him and he flung an
[1:16:31] eat well at him bid him to go another
[1:16:33] time two Fanatics came to him to induce
[1:16:35] him to join with them in banishing all
[1:16:37] priests and bibles he discerned the
[1:16:39] spirit and sent them
[1:16:41] off he was a Prophet evangelist speaker
[1:16:44] in tongues interpreter and one person
[1:16:47] endowed with all nine gifts of the
[1:16:48] Spirit what stirred his heart by the
[1:16:51] Holy Ghost In which was the little green
[1:16:52] Shute and that's what we're going to
[1:16:53] talk about this afternoon he was the
[1:16:55] little green shoot that signified that
[1:16:58] truth was coming back it wasn't there
[1:17:01] you got a name that you're living that
[1:17:03] you're dead I'm not really happy with
[1:17:05] everything you're doing that's what he
[1:17:07] said your works are not
[1:17:10] perfect back to the church as it was
[1:17:12] known at Pentecost was the doctrine of
[1:17:14] justification salvation by grace do you
[1:17:16] know that you have based
[1:17:19] your new birth on that man's teaching
[1:17:25] come on you have based your new birth on
[1:17:28] being justified by faith and that God
[1:17:32] was just to forgive you
[1:17:35] yes but you can't stay there he stayed
[1:17:38] there cuz he had no more word that was
[1:17:40] his part that was what God expected him
[1:17:41] to do but you and I that's our first
[1:17:44] work everybody with
[1:17:48] me I recognize Dr Luther did not believe
[1:17:50] only and preach only justification but
[1:17:52] that was his major theme as in indeed it
[1:17:55] had to be for it was the basic doctrine
[1:17:57] of the truth of the word he will be
[1:17:59] forever known as the instrument in the
[1:18:01] hand of God who revived this truth he
[1:18:04] was the fifth messenger and his message
[1:18:06] was the just shall live by faith surely
[1:18:09] we admit he knew and did teach that we
[1:18:11] are to go from Faith to Faith His
[1:18:13] Marvelous understanding of sovereignty
[1:18:14] election predestination and other truth
[1:18:16] show him to be a great man in the word
[1:18:19] yet I say again as do historians God
[1:18:21] used him to bring to the people God's
[1:18:23] standard against works which is what you
[1:18:26] can't be saved by your works and that's
[1:18:29] what you and I base our Salvation on
[1:18:32] today that it's not works listen we do
[1:18:36] Works after yes we get born again now as
[1:18:40] I mentioned already this age has been
[1:18:42] called by the historians the period of
[1:18:44] reformation that is exactly right that
[1:18:47] is what it is it had to be that for
[1:18:48] Martin Luther was a reformer not a
[1:18:51] prophet that's why folks we needed a
[1:18:53] prophet in the end time to bring the
[1:18:56] word of God straight from the mind of
[1:18:58] God straight through his mouth straight
[1:19:00] to me and you now listen Luther did get
[1:19:02] a piece of that the just shall live by
[1:19:05] faith that was in the mind of God he was
[1:19:07] pleased when Martin Luther said the just
[1:19:09] shall live by faith but there's more
[1:19:12] yes that is what it was it had to be
[1:19:15] that for Martin Luther was a reformer
[1:19:16] not a prophet so he was not able to lead
[1:19:19] the church back to the whole
[1:19:21] truth as would a man like the Apostle
[1:19:23] Paul who was both Apostle and
[1:19:29] Prophet the word does not call it a
[1:19:31] restoration of musicians come on the
[1:19:34] word does not call it a restoration but
[1:19:35] certainly calls it a Reformation had it
[1:19:38] been a restoration that age would have
[1:19:40] been another Pentecostal age that's why
[1:19:42] we got to have over here praise God a
[1:19:45] Pentecostal age that we just came
[1:19:47] through and listen I'm talking about
[1:19:49] Pentecost by birth I ain't talking about
[1:19:51] Pentecost by what they had in 1906
[1:19:53] Pentecost by birth Earth
[1:19:58] yes but it was not the best that could
[1:20:01] be said of it strengthened that which
[1:20:03] remains that is ready to die there was
[1:20:05] something missing yes sir there
[1:20:07] certainly
[1:20:09] was this age had justification but it
[1:20:11] had missed
[1:20:14] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:20:16] Holy Ghost that is what God's original
[1:20:17] plan was that is what they had at
[1:20:20] Pentecost they were Justified they were
[1:20:22] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[1:20:23] Ghost and that's Pentecost
[1:20:25] listen to me the reason for being
[1:20:27] justified and Sanctified is to the end
[1:20:29] that you might be baptized with the Holy
[1:20:32] Ghost that is the reason that there is a
[1:20:34] church it's the temple of God filled
[1:20:36] with God even the holy ghost that same
[1:20:39] spirit that was in Jesus while he was
[1:20:40] here on Earth causing him to do the
[1:20:42] mighty Works which he did came back on
[1:20:44] that church in Pentecost now it didn't
[1:20:46] come back on Luther it did in
[1:20:49] part we know in part we prophesy in part
[1:20:53] but that which is perfect is come
[1:20:55] that which is in part we don't do away
[1:20:57] with justification we move through
[1:21:00] it this age did not have those words oh
[1:21:03] they had the written word but not the
[1:21:05] revealed
[1:21:07] word that was the Reformation period but
[1:21:09] fear not little flock God said I will
[1:21:12] restore we'll talk about that this
[1:21:13] afternoon let's stand to our feet and
[1:21:15] this reform was going to be the start of
[1:21:18] it God listen God don't have to start
[1:21:20] anywhere but he has to start something
[1:21:22] in you somewhere yes sir right we didn't
[1:21:25] come here full grown we came here as
[1:21:27] babies he was going to according to his
[1:21:30] promise take the church back from the
[1:21:32] depth of Satan in the dark ages to the
[1:21:35] depths of God today we stand in the
[1:21:38] depths of God if you'll believe it if
[1:21:40] you don't think this is just a church to
[1:21:41] come
[1:21:45] to we're in the depths of God that they
[1:21:47] had at Pentecost in the first few years
[1:21:49] of the existence of the
[1:21:52] church now be careful and get this
[1:21:55] it says in this second verse it reads
[1:21:57] for I have not found thy works perfect
[1:21:58] before God do you know that the meaning
[1:22:01] of not perfect really is it is
[1:22:04] unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled
[1:22:07] age it was just the start of getting
[1:22:11] back do you remember your
[1:22:13] start if you don't remember your start
[1:22:16] you don't have a you don't have a an
[1:22:18] ending you got a beginning you got to
[1:22:21] know where you came
[1:22:23] from that is why I said the Bible called
[1:22:25] it Reformation not restoration it had
[1:22:27] started out the doctrine of
[1:22:28] justification which meant salvation was
[1:22:30] all of God and how Luther preached the
[1:22:33] sovereignty of God in election he knew
[1:22:35] it was all of Grace he separated the
[1:22:37] church from rule by ecclesiastical
[1:22:39] hierarchy he tore down the idols cast
[1:22:41] out the confession Booth he denounced
[1:22:43] the pope it was wonderfully good as he
[1:22:46] started but God said 1500 years before
[1:22:48] Luther you are going to start something
[1:22:51] but your age will see it unfulfilled I
[1:22:54] leaving that to the later hallelujah our
[1:22:57] god reth he knows the end from the
[1:22:59] beginning yes Luther was his messenger
[1:23:01] it didn't look like it as We examined
[1:23:03] the flaws but there was a man called
[1:23:05] Jonah I say there was a Man Called
[1:23:08] Moses they had
[1:23:10] flaws he had flaws in his life too he
[1:23:13] was a prophet though you and I might not
[1:23:15] want to say it on the basis of how he
[1:23:19] acted now this was an unfulfilled age it
[1:23:23] was an age of ref information but that
[1:23:26] is how God wanted it listen if God's
[1:23:30] satisfied with that you better be
[1:23:32] satisfied with it because it's perfect
[1:23:35] if God's satisfied then I'm satisfied
[1:23:38] that Luther had to come and give us a
[1:23:40] message of justification and we stand
[1:23:42] like I said before we stand on that if
[1:23:45] you don't believe that God Justified you
[1:23:47] your sins are still hanging on
[1:23:49] you
[1:23:51] hello but then we got to believe and
[1:23:53] know that brother comes and he tells us
[1:23:55] from the mind of God he said that person
[1:23:57] inside of you never did it to begin with
[1:24:00] now that wasn't a revelation of Martin
[1:24:03] Luther Martin Luther said we're saved by
[1:24:06] right here grace through faith
[1:24:08] justification we can't do anything we
[1:24:10] know
[1:24:12] that but we know that we've come into
[1:24:14] that come to that justification in The
[1:24:15] Headstone where you realize you didn't
[1:24:18] do it to begin with that real you inside
[1:24:21] of you that came to you at your new
[1:24:22] birth it's developing enough to tell you
[1:24:25] I'm perfect I'm sinless I'm just telling
