[10:27] those that are away and
[10:30] I wa down preaching with brother Collins
[10:32] last night and today we had a real good
[10:34] time last night went down and fellowship
[10:37] with them a little bit you know had a
[10:39] good time in the Lord I got even with
[10:41] Terrence cuz you know how he's always
[10:43] coming along tapping me in the back of
[10:45] the head because we past life when we
[10:48] used to take him around to everybody's
[10:50] house and they had to eat bean sprouts
[10:52] and stuff like that you know because we
[10:55] was trying to be nice so I got even with
[10:57] him last night and brother Colin was
[10:59] want to know if I could lead singing I
[11:00] said no but Terren
[11:07] can't I got eat
[11:09] with just get himat
[11:13] me but we had a good time it was Wai
[11:16] wait really done a marvelous job
[11:17] preaching you know and really really did
[11:20] remember my wife this morning uh we got
[11:23] in last night about 11:00 and she just
[11:25] couldn't go to sleep and took a migraine
[11:27] headache and she's in the bed this
[11:28] morning with
[11:29] the migraine headache so remember her
[11:31] and just just keep praying for her that
[11:33] the Lord would take that away from her
[11:34] and let everything be all right now
[11:36] remember the Bible study will be this
[11:38] coming Saturday 6:00 so remember that
[11:41] cuz we we wouldn't able to have it
[11:43] yesterday because the way being gone and
[11:46] everything didn't want to do it that way
[11:47] so we'll have the the Bible study now
[11:49] there won't be any uh uh communion foot
[11:52] washing until next month so we announce
[11:54] it where we won't get everything tied up
[11:56] cuz we already had it first of the year
[11:58] and I we appreciate amen you like turn
[12:01] in your scriptures turn back where we've
[12:03] been reading in
[12:04] Matthew 5 and then we will go to
[12:08] Psalms
[12:10] 102 Matthew 5 and Psalms
[12:14] 102 I want to try to continue on the
[12:17] thought of what we were talking about on
[12:20] the new creation our Wednesday night and
[12:24] you know kind of carry it on over to a
[12:26] little further and and tie it together
[12:28] with the entire Bible to where we can
[12:31] see you know because I I as a firm
[12:34] believer I believe that by the new birth
[12:37] we are a new creature in Christ Jesus
[12:39] amen but in body and spirit we're still
[12:42] in this old natural creation and things
[12:45] of life but I believe in a Redemption
[12:48] that's right of not only the soul I
[12:50] believe in the body the spirit being
[12:53] redeemed to be a new creation and even
[12:55] this world to be a new creation right so
[12:59] Isaiah said you know that he create a
[13:01] new heavens and a new Earth I believe in
[13:03] that but not a different one right it's
[13:06] the same one made over cleansed and and
[13:09] redeemed so then that way nobody can't
[13:12] misunderstand what I'm trying to say and
[13:14] trying to bring unto you but you know
[13:16] just just remember that okay let's pray
[13:19] father we thank you for this day and
[13:20] your love unto us we thank you for your
[13:22] grace we ask you to just bless us now
[13:25] with your presence give us understanding
[13:27] ears that we may hear
[13:29] lead us by Thy Thy love Lord we bless
[13:32] way there today as he's ministering for
[13:34] brother Collins and we pray that you'd
[13:36] be with them and open their
[13:37] understanding and his that he may speak
[13:39] unto them and just let your love be
[13:41] there we ask you to be with our wife
[13:43] this morning that's old headaches and
[13:45] things that she has father we condemn
[13:48] them through the blood of Jesus Christ
[13:50] and believing that all is well we love
[13:52] you and we thank you and just have your
[13:54] way now in each one as we try to speak
[13:57] about you today you come on the scene
[13:58] and speak to our hearts and our lives
[14:01] forgive our sins because we want to be
[14:03] covered and kept covered by the blood
[14:06] guide us now and lead us Lord in Jesus
[14:09] name amen
[14:13] amen we've been reading this scripture
[14:16] and the way it looks now ANC I try to
[14:20] I'm going quitting announcing ahead of
[14:21] time all right I thought I'd try to get
[14:24] over this afternoon to questions and
[14:26] answers but looks like it's probably at
[14:28] least going to be next weekend uh to do
[14:31] because you know there won't be we won't
[14:34] be able to get to it I've got some
[14:36] points I'm wanting to bring to you and
[14:38] as I try to get something it just keeps
[14:40] unfolding so you know we just keep going
[14:43] also too now remember that on the 18th
[14:47] on Wednesday the Aaron will be preaching
[14:49] for you here because uh brother Donnie
[14:54] and Zach and Wade and myself will be in
[14:56] Alabama hunting for that week that'll be
[14:59] we start on the 16th I think and true
[15:02] but then we had to change the fellowship
[15:04] meeting and I don't really know where
[15:07] they're where it's going to be because
[15:10] we asked them to put it off from here it
[15:13] would due our time but we ask them to
[15:15] please change it to somebody else to
[15:17] where we could do it because you know
[15:19] it's not that you make some one thing
[15:21] above the other one but when things are
[15:23] set in order then sometimes it's hard to
[15:26] change and all so it's you say well you
[15:29] could go deer hunting at another time
[15:30] well that's true but we try to go for
[15:32] the prime time to where we can you know
[15:35] to be able to do and all like that but
[15:37] just forgive us if you don't agree
[15:39] course a lot of people don't agree we're
[15:40] going do them anyway so then that
[15:42] wouldn't change nothing you know it's
[15:44] just all the same but that's that's all
[15:47] right you just uh you do your thing I
[15:50] have to do mine and then I just tell you
[15:52] where I stand and where we walk in the
[15:54] Lord all right so just remember that and
[15:58] uh just Let Your Love be made
[16:00] manifest and uh father
[16:03] just bless us as we read your word yes
[16:07] you come on the scene now and you have
[16:09] your way in Jesus
[16:13] name Matthew
[16:15] 5:37 let your communication be yay yay
[16:18] nay nay for whatsoever is more than
[16:21] these cometh of evil you have heard that
[16:24] it hath been said an eye for an eye and
[16:27] a tooth for a tooth but but I say unto
[16:29] you that you resist not evil but
[16:30] whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[16:33] cheek turn to him the other also and if
[16:36] any man will sue thee at the law and
[16:39] take away thy coat let him have thy
[16:41] cloak also and whosoever shall compel
[16:44] thee to go a mile go with him Twain give
[16:47] to him that asketh thee and from him
[16:50] that would borrow of thee turn not thou
[16:54] away you have heard that it hath been
[16:56] said Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor and
[16:58] hate thine enemy but I say unto you love
[17:01] your enemies bless them that curse you
[17:04] do good to them that hate you and pray
[17:06] for them which despitefully use you and
[17:08] persecute you that you may be the
[17:11] children of your father which is in
[17:13] heaven for he maketh his son to rise on
[17:16] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[17:18] rain on the just and on the unjust for
[17:21] if we love them which love for if you
[17:24] love them which love you what reward
[17:27] have you ye
[17:29] do not even the publicans are say and if
[17:32] you salute your brethren only what do
[17:35] you more than others do not even the
[17:37] publicans so be therefore perfect even
[17:40] as your father which is in heaven is
[17:43] perfect now we'll go over
[17:45] to Psalms
[17:48] 102 we'll begin about verse
[17:54] 16 when the Lord shall build up Zion he
[17:57] shall appear in his Glory he will regard
[18:00] the prayer of the destitute and not
[18:02] despise their
[18:04] prayer this shall be written for the
[18:06] generation to come and the people which
[18:09] shall be created shall praise the Lord
[18:13] for Heath looked down from the heights
[18:15] of the sanctuary from Heaven did the
[18:17] Lord behold the Earth to hear the
[18:19] groaning of the prisoner to loose those
[18:23] that are appointed to death now the main
[18:25] thought will be taken from verse 18 for
[18:28] this shall be written for the generation
[18:30] to come and the people which shall be
[18:33] created shall praise the Lord you may be
[18:37] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[18:39] reading of the word so you see
[18:41] immediately that we're still tying
[18:43] together with the uh message on
[18:46] Wednesday of the new creation so we're
[18:49] reading here that that there will be a
[18:52] people a
[18:55] generation see this is written for the
[18:59] generation that is to come right and the
[19:03] people that shall be
[19:05] created shall praise the Lord so then
[19:08] we're we're not looking at something
[19:11] different or odd we're looking at the
[19:13] opening of the word and trying to follow
[19:17] that and then we know in Revelations
[19:20] 3:14 the message to the Ladi lady in
[19:23] church age is that he's the beginning of
[19:26] the creation of God
[19:28] all right so then if it means what it
[19:31] means as we do in the English language
[19:34] if he's the beginning of the creation of
[19:36] God then that means there will be more
[19:38] to that
[19:39] creation and that's the point I'm trying
[19:41] to get you and I to see is our part of
[19:44] that because by the new birth we become
[19:49] the children of God we become his
[19:52] offspring everybody brother Donnie and I
[19:55] talking about it last night coming back
[19:56] home every child in the world every
[19:59] person in the world is is a child of God
[20:01] by creation cuz he created him I mean
[20:04] there's no way the Devil Couldn't create
[20:06] right but now when it came down to life
[20:11] and sin entered the picture then you
[20:15] find out that in the Old Testament then
[20:17] they wouldn't be called the children of
[20:19] God they would be servants or things
[20:22] like that me using the words to
[20:25] signify but then when Jes Jesus came he
[20:29] was the beginning of the creation of God
[20:32] in other words God came down in human
[20:35] flesh amen took upon himself the form of
[20:38] human flesh and started a total New
[20:42] Creation as way was talking about last
[20:44] night about the uh the fact of him being
[20:47] his
[20:49] DNA see then you can't find the DNA of
[20:52] the Lord Jesus connected to mankind
[20:55] right cuz there's no way cuz he was a
[20:58] new creation and like we were talking
[21:00] about and I've expressed it to you and I
[21:03] know I spend a lot of time explaining
[21:05] things but I I don't want you to be
[21:09] confused and then just the devil can
[21:10] just play with your mind and all but him
[21:15] being a new
[21:17] creation then the prophet of God saying
[21:20] it he said his body came out of this
[21:23] Earth okay but did it come out of this
[21:26] sinful Earth
[21:28] because it went on for about 4,000 years
[21:31] before his body appears did he come out
[21:34] of the sinful Earth all right if he did
[21:37] it wouldn't be a new creation that's
[21:39] right Adam was a new
[21:42] creation right right because there was
[21:45] no creation before them so he was a new
[21:48] creation all right first of that human
[21:51] race well the Lord Jesus was a new
[21:55] creation of the this new race right that
[21:58] was going to be The Offspring of God all
[22:01] right then in that then the the Bible
[22:04] and the prophets right and we we stay
[22:06] with what we believe on it but yet did
[22:08] his body come out of this natural sinful
[22:11] Earth or did his body come from the
[22:13] original
[22:17] creation his body came not as a 16
[22:21] elements of Christ that we've polluted
[22:24] he didn't take that and make a body he
[22:26] went back to the original creation and
[22:29] brought the body into existence because
[22:31] there's no way to connect your DNA to
[22:33] any human being upon Earth that's right
[22:36] because he was God made manifest in
[22:39] flesh he created a body to come down and
[22:43] live in all right that's the beginning
[22:45] of the creation of
[22:47] God was that body that he was there and
[22:50] we'll get to that in a little bit but
[22:52] I'm wanting you to see our part
[22:55] then because that to me me is the the
[22:59] great thing of the end time to
[23:01] understand is the revelation of one true
[23:04] and living God that's right all right
[23:07] see if we're One Creation he's another
[23:09] creation talking spiritually now we know
[23:13] he was
[23:15] physically but yet by the new birth he
[23:17] makes us his children then we are his
[23:20] offspring then if he's One Creation in a
[23:23] spiritual sense and we're another
[23:24] Creation in a spiritual
[23:26] sense what have you got you got
[23:29] something separate and it wouldn't work
[23:31] out and I I love to to uh you know uh to
[23:35] read what the prophet of God has said
[23:38] and and I'm I'm not saying this wrongly
[23:40] but the man that done the the bringing
[23:42] of the church age book into existence
[23:45] into words you know and put it down uh
[23:49] he evidently doesn't agree with the
[23:52] things that he wrote In the
[23:54] book I guess because brother brandom
[23:56] made him write it cuz he said himself
[23:59] that there was a lot of things he didn't
[24:00] want to put in there that brother R said
[24:02] you put it in there like that well you
[24:04] know that's that's I believe then the
[24:07] church age book is is authentic that's
[24:10] right I don't have no problems with it I
[24:12] challenge anybody to come and show me oh
[24:14] yes they wrote me a letter one time we
[24:16] got 17 contradictions in it I said come
[24:19] on show me one of them well they never
[24:22] come yet so you know but they say they
[24:24] got 17 because of this or something like
[24:26] that I said well come on show
[24:29] me so you'd say well brother rer said in
[24:31] the church age book that the Rapture
[24:33] would take place on the fourth seal and
[24:36] how did he know that well remember the
[24:37] church AE book wouldn't put out until
[24:39] after the SKS was
[24:41] preached I mean Common Sense answers
[24:43] most of their
[24:45] contradictions but they don't think
[24:47] about it like that well whether the man
[24:49] that wrote it agreed with it or not I
[24:50] don't have no problem I love it right
[24:53] because the church Agee book shows us
[24:56] and to me that's the greatest book to
[24:57] introduce the prophet's message with
[25:00] that's the one I use you may use
[25:01] different ones I use a church age book
[25:03] why cu the first 10 and something pages
[25:05] is is one God and serpent SE amen all
[25:08] right if they can swallow that you know
[25:11] you can move on you got the water
[25:14] baptism you got all of the one God and
[25:16] then you got the serpent seat you know
[25:19] right so it's a good thing to introduce
[25:21] so let's just read something we've read
[25:22] it many times but I want to make sure
[25:25] you get
[25:26] it
[25:28] you know get it yourself and understand
[25:30] it I'm not talking about just a
[25:33] revelation of a group of people or
[25:36] somebody that we think oh great look who
[25:38] we are you know look what we are it's
[25:40] not it's all in
[25:43] him if we have any honor glory
[25:46] whatsoever it's all in Jesus Christ it's
[25:49] not in you and I we're not worth nothing
[25:51] we're nothing but just the same old
[25:53] elements that Adam was made from you
[25:55] know and from the same one ones that can
[25:58] and and and all of that the garbage cuz
[26:02] see our M and daddies did eat eat us
[26:04] here you're body come from your mama and
[26:07] daddy and your grandmother and your
[26:08] granddaddy and etc etc etc they kept
[26:10] eating kept eating kept eating and
[26:12] finally It produced a a germ or whatever
[26:15] you want to call it to come forth and
[26:17] bring your natural body into existence
[26:20] but the Lord Jesus didn't come that way
[26:22] he come by
[26:24] creation all right so the new the the
[26:27] bride that I'm talking about is not the
[26:29] old order the prophet said will read
[26:31] made
[26:33] over or it wouldn't be called a new
[26:35] creation that's right all right see as I
[26:39] said Adam was a new creation nothing
[26:41] ever been created like Adam that's right
[26:43] so he was a new one he was the first of
[26:46] the human race all right but it meant
[26:49] there would be more to come all right
[26:52] Jesus was the first of this creation
[26:54] this race of God in human flesh amen
[26:58] amen all right but it showed there would
[27:00] be more right which would be you and me
[27:03] that's right all right see then we we
[27:05] wouldn't have to worry about it we could
[27:07] follow along and and that's why I love
[27:09] what the prophet has to say so let's go
[27:10] to 336 of the church age
[27:13] book and just get what the prophet is
[27:17] saying to
[27:18] us and read yourself in there I know we
[27:21] read this over and over and over but
[27:24] still read it and get yourself in
[27:29] there see he's not just explaining one
[27:33] God but he's not just explaining the
[27:39] bride he's explaining the whole thing of
[27:43] redemption that would come forth so now
[27:46] watch what he
[27:48] say but now he is standing in the midst
[27:51] of the
[27:52] church as he stand there revealing who
[27:55] he is in this life
[27:58] age watch he calls
[28:03] himself the man didn't do that he calls
[28:06] himself the author of the creation of
[28:08] God this is another creation what this
[28:13] has to do with the
[28:16] church now the message to the lady you
[28:18] see in church age is the message of
[28:21] revelation of one true and living God
[28:25] but to show you that God and where he's
[28:26] at
[28:28] no other age has that Revelation given
[28:31] unto him as I said the other day Paul in
[28:34] his saying that you know that we're a
[28:36] new create creature a new creation
[28:39] everybody received a new
[28:42] birth everybody down through time from
[28:45] from Pentecost till now that's received
[28:47] the new birth is a new creature in
[28:49] Christ Jesus right all right part of
[28:52] this race because it started a super
[28:55] race of people
[28:58] all right but no age
[29:02] understood who they were right all right
[29:06] then in understanding who we
[29:10] are all right and remember it is he that
[29:13] has made us not we ourselves so we're
[29:16] out of it it's what he takes to us all
[29:19] right but see he's made
[29:22] us this new
[29:25] creation all right that's why when we
[29:28] get there there'll be plenty of people
[29:31] be given eternal life yeah but they
[29:34] won't be a part of that in you race it
[29:36] won't be his wife that's right they
[29:37] won't be his bride whatever word you
[29:39] want to use that's
[29:41] right because
[29:43] they don't step into that line that's
[29:46] right all right then you can get into
[29:48] all of the things that we was this and
[29:50] we was that before the world why not
[29:52] just get down where we at and stay here
[29:54] where we're at and just let go on from
[29:56] here
[29:58] because I can't go back there
[30:00] right but I can start here and move on
[30:04] and see who I am amen all right see then
[30:07] if he's explaining one God as he says he
[30:12] is and says this is the true revelation
[30:14] of God then you're a part of
[30:19] God that's that seems to be hard for the
[30:22] human mind to comprehend but I'm not
[30:24] talking about your body that's the old
[30:26] order of man right that come from the
[30:30] adamic fall that's the old order and the
[30:33] prophet says here he's not dealing by
[30:35] ways of the old
[30:39] order he's dealing by a new
[30:42] creation we'll get to it this afternoon
[30:44] maybe a little see this creation that
[30:48] I'm talking about can't sin right
[30:52] right amen but the body that we live in
[30:55] by the spirit that we have that is in a
[30:58] fallen condition is still subject to
[31:01] life that's right
[31:03] right and can sin that's right that's
[31:06] right all right so we're in a split
[31:09] Condition it's not that he doesn't
[31:11] impute sin to the soul the soul can't
[31:13] sin that's right I don't want to get on
[31:16] that that's that's in my mind so we'll
[31:18] get back to that this evening all
[31:20] right but now listen see now he's
[31:23] standing in the midst of his
[31:26] church he's not outside right he's in
[31:30] his church amen all right you well over
[31:33] there it says he knocks at the door yeah
[31:35] cuz he's outside the church world all
[31:38] right where's the
[31:41] bride how is he outside of the church
[31:44] world
[31:46] today now listen that's why I try like
[31:48] to I like to explain things to where you
[31:50] know that he's in the church world today
[31:52] Healing The Sick and and they're
[31:54] shouting and having glorious times and
[31:56] worshiping and and all kind of you know
[31:58] he's there
[32:00] right
[32:01] right well then why does the bible say
[32:04] that he's outside the door knock
[32:06] you because he's in you and you can't
[32:09] get in that church that's right oh yeah
[32:12] if you lay down everything you believe
[32:15] and if you don't say nothing about what
[32:16] you believe you're welcomed right that's
[32:19] right but if you just won't go in there
[32:22] with long ha they know right real quick
[32:24] it's something different about you Y and
[32:27] you're not welcomed that's right see
[32:30] that way you are the one that's outside
[32:33] of the
[32:34] church the church world you are the
[32:38] bride that's been called out of the
[32:40] church system all right so then where's
[32:43] he at he's in you and
[32:45] me but he can be there to heal the
[32:48] sick all kind of things can happen in
[32:52] the
[32:53] churches but he's outside the door
[32:55] because the word has been put out right
[32:57] well you and I are the word amen right
[33:01] do you follow what I'm trying to bring
[33:04] yes but he calls himself this says this
[33:07] is another creation this has to do with
[33:10] the church this is a special designation
[33:13] of
[33:15] himself now he just said it was the
[33:17] church then he said it's
[33:20] himself right are you are you reading
[33:23] right he said it's the church but then
[33:25] he said it's himself right so The Church
[33:27] Must Be himself amen amen right right
[33:31] she's the one that's outside that's
[33:34] right she's the one that's trying to get
[33:36] back in
[33:37] right all right so watch what he saying
[33:41] this is a special designation of himself
[33:44] watch he is the creator of that
[33:48] church now
[33:51] watching so evidently as I said they
[33:53] even caught the point of what he was
[33:56] talking about about the writer that put
[33:59] it down you know into words must have
[34:02] caught what he was the point or either
[34:05] the Holy Spirit made him catch it
[34:07] because it should have been when he come
[34:09] down to the
[34:11] church he it should have been divided
[34:13] into
[34:15] paragraphs but it wasn't divided into
[34:17] paragraphs so it must have the same
[34:20] point did everybody understand what I
[34:21] mean by that
[34:22] yes when you change the thoughts you're
[34:25] supposed to change paragrass that's
[34:26] right amen so now he's talking about a
[34:29] bride and he's talking about how he's
[34:32] created the church then he immediately
[34:34] starts talking about his
[34:37] body right
[34:41] right whatever then it's got to be tied
[34:44] together so what the Heavenly bridegroom
[34:47] created his own bride okay we can follow
[34:49] that yes
[34:50] all but how did he do
[34:54] it how did he create his own
[34:59] right as the spirit of
[35:01] God he's explaining how he done it
[35:04] that's right right as the spirit of God
[35:06] he came down and created in the Virgin
[35:07] Mary the cells from which his body was
[35:10] born amen that's right now he's talking
[35:13] about his natural body
[35:16] right but if you and I right wasn't in
[35:20] him when he was in that
[35:23] body now you follow me not in the DNA
[35:26] not in the the running around in the
[35:28] sails and a little bitty no no no
[35:32] no we was in the God that was in the
[35:34] body that's right right amen that
[35:37] created his own
[35:39] body which his body was born I want to
[35:41] repeat that he created the very C in the
[35:43] wound of Mary for that body it was not
[35:45] enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply
[35:48] give life to a human ovium supplied by
[35:51] Mary so see that does away with all of
[35:54] the things the connections the DN the
[35:56] things
[35:57] he said that would have been sinful
[35:59] mankind producing a body right because
[36:02] the woman has the egg
[36:05] right the egg is where the body comes
[36:07] forth from gerti by The Germ right all
[36:11] right so then she didn't have anything
[36:13] to do with it cuz he ain't talking about
[36:15] a natural body he talking about a
[36:18] spiritual body within
[36:20] himself he's talking about his own
[36:22] natural body right but showing us that
[36:26] that natural body was almighty God right
[36:29] right am not another person not this
[36:32] that or the other but almighty
[36:36] God that's going to come into
[36:39] manifestation and it didn't end it a
[36:42] Calvary it didn't end with him here upon
[36:45] Earth cuz now we're his
[36:49] body right come on follow the whole
[36:53] point it was not enough for the Holy
[36:56] Spirit
[36:57] to Simply give life to a human over and
[36:58] Supply by Mary that would have been the
[37:00] sin been sinful mankind producing a body
[37:03] right that would not have produced the
[37:06] last Adam right all right of whom it was
[37:09] said Lo a body hast thou father prepared
[37:13] for me God not Mary provided that Holy
[37:16] provided that body Mary was a human
[37:19] incubator and she carried that holy
[37:20] child and brought him to birth it was a
[37:23] God
[37:24] man he was the son Son of God he was of
[37:28] the new creation God and man met and
[37:31] joined he was the first of this new race
[37:34] he is the head of this new race all
[37:39] right now if he's the head of this new
[37:42] race then what would that make him
[37:45] Colossians
[37:46] 1:18 he is the head of the body the
[37:49] church so now who's the
[37:52] body we're his body right right that's
[37:56] right right so a body thou Hast prepared
[37:59] me that's
[38:01] right back there it was one
[38:05] body for God to live in right amen
[38:08] that's right now by the new
[38:12] birth we become the body of Jesus
[38:15] Christ so he hasn't
[38:20] stopped see when he created that body he
[38:24] didn't stop creating
[38:28] he's creating a
[38:30] bride to be his body
[38:33] am so as long as the members of the body
[38:36] of Christ are coming into the body God
[38:38] still created that's right he hasn't
[38:40] stop that's
[38:43] right he stopped the
[38:47] physical turned it into a spiritual all
[38:50] right he's the head of the body of the
[38:52] church who is the beginning the first
[38:53] born from the dead that in all things he
[38:55] might have to PR
[38:57] second Corinthians 5:17 therefore any
[38:59] man be in Christ is a new creation new
[39:02] creatur old things that passed away
[39:05] behold all things are become new there
[39:08] you can see that though man was of the
[39:10] old order or
[39:12] creation that's what we was now in Union
[39:16] with Christ he has become the new
[39:18] creation of God now that's only in your
[39:20] soul
[39:23] right that's only in your soul right
[39:26] that's right that's right so we have to
[39:29] make a way to make these bodies a new
[39:32] creation right all right see that's the
[39:37] key to the end time is that we're here
[39:39] where this can be done right and all of
[39:42] the world Hebrews what is it 11:40
[39:44] they're waiting on us right
[39:47] amen see to realize who we are Amen to
[39:52] step out on who we are and claim it
[39:54] that's right and walk for forth into
[39:57] him all
[40:01] right you can see that though man was of
[40:04] the old order of creation Now in Union
[40:05] with Christ he has become the new
[40:07] creation of God that's Ephesians 2:10
[40:09] for we are his workmanship created in
[40:11] Union with Christ Jesus un good works
[40:14] Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on the
[40:16] new man which after God is created in
[40:19] righteousness and true Holiness look
[40:21] this cre new creation is not the old
[40:25] creation made over
[40:27] or it could not be called a new creation
[40:30] right simple language right right all
[40:34] right it is another
[40:39] creation are you listening it's another
[40:43] creation distinct from the old
[40:46] one no longer is he dealing by ways of
[40:49] the flesh that was how he dealt with
[40:51] Israel he chose Abraham and Abraham's
[40:53] issued Through The Godly Isaac line but
[40:56] but now out of every Kindred tribe and
[40:58] Nation he has purposed a new creation he
[41:02] is the first of that
[41:03] creation he was God created in the form
[41:06] of man now by his Spirit he is creating
[41:10] many sons unto himself God the Creator
[41:14] created himself a part of his creation
[41:17] and that's something in it God the
[41:19] Creator created his part of his own
[41:21] creation
[41:22] yes but look what he says it
[41:25] is this is the true revelation of
[41:31] God how can you see God without coming
[41:34] through the fact of finally realizing it
[41:37] has to deal up in with the
[41:41] church this is the revelation of
[41:44] God the true
[41:47] Revelation is
[41:50] one that he is the beginning of the
[41:54] creation and we're the rest of the
[41:58] creation he's not talking about our
[42:00] bodies in
[42:02] that that has to come forth into an
[42:05] understanding for this age right each
[42:09] age can get the Revelation I keep saying
[42:11] it of that they are a new creature
[42:13] that's right Paul said old things have
[42:16] passed away he said the Liv that I now
[42:18] live in this flesh I live by the faith
[42:20] of the Son of
[42:23] God see they could see that were new
[42:25] creatures in Christ
[42:28] Jesus but the end time Revelation is to
[42:31] see that we are going to have to be
[42:34] connected and I I'm just honest I don't
[42:37] believe they seen that that is what we
[42:39] see about that we're a part of
[42:44] God you said well I what I do too I
[42:47] believe they knew they were new
[42:48] creatures and that God was living in
[42:53] them but do you think they understood
[42:56] that they were actually a part of
[43:00] God to be made
[43:04] manifest I don't necessarily think they
[43:06] did that's right I believe that's the
[43:08] end
[43:09] time he says that's the true revelation
[43:12] of God what all this we've got to
[43:14] reading up above
[43:16] there about the bride and who we are and
[43:19] the new
[43:20] creatures is a true Revelation that's
[43:23] true of God Amen God living in his
[43:26] people right
[43:30] right God manifesting himself in his
[43:33] people all this is the true revelation
[43:35] of God this was his purpose this purpose
[43:39] took form through
[43:41] election right how could you just stop
[43:44] on each one see that is why you look
[43:46] right down to the last age when all
[43:48] would be over and see himself still in
[43:52] the midst of the church as author of
[43:54] this new creation of God his Sovereign
[43:57] power brought it to P by his own decree
[44:00] he elected the members of this new
[44:02] creation he predestinated them through
[44:05] the adoption of children according to
[44:07] the good pleasure of his
[44:09] will by his own if omniscience and
[44:14] omnipotence he brought it to pipes how
[44:16] El could he know what's
[44:19] not he brought it to P how else could he
[44:23] know what that he be wor
[44:29] standing in the midst of the
[44:32] church you remember the Bible where it
[44:34] said you stand in the midst of seven
[44:36] golden
[44:38] Candlestick he standing in the midst of
[44:41] the
[44:42] church receiving Glory from his
[44:47] Brethren what if he did not make sure
[44:52] what how could he be doing how could he
[44:53] be standing there how else could he know
[44:56] that he would be standing in the midst
[44:57] of the church receiving Glory from his
[44:59] Brethren if he did not make sure all
[45:02] things in you and all things are going
[45:05] to work to his honor and Glory that's
[45:07] right if I were you I would read that
[45:10] over and over and
[45:16] over and read yourself
[45:20] there but don't jump up there now s of a
[45:23] bodily thing until you start dealing
[45:25] with you know well then it don't matter
[45:27] what I do cuz I'm saved
[45:31] anyway brother Dell Don't Preach junk
[45:33] that's
[45:35] right brother said you sin a sin as a
[45:38] Christian he said you will repay TB
[45:41] F right but you can't be lost that's
[45:44] right well then don't make no D what to
[45:46] do because it can't be lost well if you
[45:49] think like that then you're already lost
[45:51] that's right is that plain
[45:54] enough I know I don't play games with
[45:56] wor that's
[45:58] right if we think we can this sin and
[46:00] live like the devil and get by with it
[46:01] then we're lost that's
[46:04] right well then you you do like the
[46:07] brother got mad at me when I he was
[46:09] telling me something and I just said
[46:10] well if you do that you're
[46:12] lost he went and told everybody I said
[46:15] he's lost I didn't say he's lost I said
[46:17] if he acted like
[46:19] that that was his choice not
[46:23] mine I believe in in being the truth of
[46:26] it don't you yes all
[46:30] right let's just read a few
[46:33] things look at the next
[46:36] one this is confirmation and evidence or
[46:39] e41 watch what he said now I feel
[46:42] religious why we are dead now how do you
[46:46] become a new
[46:48] Creature if you're still alive in your
[46:51] soul you're not born again that's
[46:54] right
[46:57] that plain enough
[46:59] yes you're still alive in your soul
[47:01] you're not born again if you're dead and
[47:03] let him come alive that's see it right
[47:06] there okay that's that's simple yes so
[47:11] the qualification for being a new
[47:13] creation has got to be dead that's
[47:16] right dead to yourself not dead
[47:19] physically that's right but dead to
[47:22] yourself that's what justification and
[47:24] sanctification done and then the Holy
[47:26] Ghost burning out
[47:29] right it destroys that old man that's
[47:32] true all
[47:34] right so watch what he said we are dead
[47:37] and our lives is hid in God through
[47:38] Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost I
[47:40] look back and see where I once
[47:43] was that William brandom died 32 years
[47:46] ago and now we are a new creation in
[47:49] Christ already raised with him and
[47:51] sitting with him in Heavenly places with
[47:54] the authority of his promise word every
[47:56] devil subject to
[47:59] that you said well I tell you what it
[48:01] don't look like it because look at all
[48:02] these
[48:04] Devils what do you think about the Lord
[48:07] Jesus in his
[48:09] life we think every devil was subject to
[48:12] it but you know what every devil in the
[48:14] world was
[48:16] I how could he be look 50 and only
[48:21] 30 because of the toils and the life and
[48:24] the doing that's right
[48:27] but see we think well the devil won't
[48:28] bother you no more after you become a
[48:29] Christian I ain't never preach nothing
[48:32] like that right I'd rather preach that
[48:34] you're going to have all the money in
[48:36] the world if you become a Christian I
[48:37] got Bible for
[48:40] that right he pour out his blessings
[48:43] that you can't control I'd rather go
[48:45] that way I Don't Preach riches as a
[48:48] Christian right
[48:51] right that's why people don't understand
[48:53] me I try to preach it straight that's
[48:55] right many are the afflictions of the
[48:58] righteous
[49:00] right well if I was a Christian I
[49:02] wouldn't be sick show me the Bible for
[49:04] that and Bre
[49:07] around Jo need
[49:10] one oh you never will have no more
[49:12] troubles somebody lied to
[49:15] you is that plain
[49:18] enough but we don't GL around and do
[49:20] like I said man told me that time said I
[49:23] I didn't know I was a Christian I found
[49:24] out that Christian have troubles and I
[49:26] have a lot of trouble so I must be a
[49:27] Christian that ain't it
[49:31] either the prophet said to what the the
[49:34] flowy skies and the things was the sign
[49:36] of God's approval neither was the the
[49:38] horrible things that would take place
[49:40] the sign of his disapproval he said his
[49:42] approval was in the elect
[49:46] right the church right God wants
[49:50] children amen that's right they can
[49:54] stand by the word that's
[49:58] right now come on around said a
[50:01] Christian is
[50:04] rugged but you know
[50:09] what if I said what I think most of the
[50:12] time a lot of you would have done been
[50:16] gone you said oh no oh
[50:21] yeah I try to be
[50:24] nice you said well just tell me like it
[50:27] is had two brothers tell me that one
[50:28] time I said you don't want me to tell
[50:31] you like it
[50:32] is cuz neither one of you would speak to
[50:35] me again after
[50:38] then but you see it's good to make a
[50:40] flapper of the mouth ain't it you let it
[50:42] tell me like it is brother Dale that's
[50:45] right
[50:46] uh-uh you tell people like it is and
[50:48] they're going to be
[50:50] gone well just run them off no I'm
[50:52] trying to save Souls I ain't trying to
[50:55] buildings everybody thinks I am but I'm
[50:57] trying to save
[51:02] Souls come on
[51:04] church if we're a part of God God can't
[51:07] get his feelings hurt that's
[51:10] right that's
[51:13] right cuz he don't have any feelings to
[51:15] get hurt that way that's
[51:19] right he said brother Dale you hurt my
[51:22] feelings that was my body dealing with
[51:25] your body to our
[51:27] Spirits cuz if you got the Holy Ghost
[51:29] and I got it it certainly can't be no
[51:30] offense in that that's
[51:33] right right that's right right come on
[51:36] wake up
[51:39] than let's face life and see where we're
[51:41] at I try to explain things and I get in
[51:43] trouble for trying to explain it
[51:46] amen I thinking there that scripture
[51:48] where it talks about you know if a man
[51:50] sue you at the law for you Coke just
[51:52] give him you cloak
[51:53] also I don't
[51:57] I don't think you ought to say okay
[51:59] now you know somebody sued me well I
[52:02] just take everything got that give it to
[52:03] him that's not what the Bible's talking
[52:08] about well it says
[52:11] that well go
[52:12] ahead I don't see you going down there
[52:15] giving it to him
[52:17] either right
[52:20] right I try to be sensible about
[52:22] everything because to me that's the only
[52:24] thing the Bible is the only thing that
[52:25] is sensible this message is the only
[52:27] thing that's sensible yes that's
[52:29] right that's why if you just be plain
[52:32] sensual about something it work out more
[52:34] than it will to try to prop it up and do
[52:36] everything else amen if we're a new
[52:39] creation in Christ Jesus then we're to
[52:40] live like it that's right
[52:43] right well you mean you won't never get
[52:44] your feet hurt I say that that's right
[52:47] but you can't get that soul to be hurt
[52:49] amen right that's
[52:51] right I told you about it you believe
[52:54] what you want to
[52:55] when I saw that person that time and I I
[52:58] was looking at a person condemning that
[53:01] person and what I did about that time
[53:03] something happened and I just backed up
[53:06] in a
[53:08] tunnel I was still standing there
[53:10] looking and I just went back in a tunnel
[53:12] and I saw that person as God saw
[53:18] him that's really been a help to
[53:21] me cuz that way I
[53:23] can you know
[53:25] I can try to
[53:27] preach and not condemn let's get on with
[53:31] it brother said that that man was dead
[53:35] William brandom was
[53:37] dead now you you can't be dead be a new
[53:41] creation you I mean you know you got to
[53:44] be dead to be a new creation so you
[53:46] can't be still alive let me make sure
[53:47] say correct you can't still be
[53:51] alive and be a new creation that's right
[53:54] and we're talking about in the soul
[53:56] that's right not talking about your body
[53:58] and your spirit right it is not redeemed
[54:02] that's right so everybody thinks that
[54:05] well why do I still have
[54:08] troubles I have all kind of
[54:11] problems well don't you think the Lord
[54:13] Jesus had all kind of
[54:17] problems and I didn't think we supposed
[54:19] to have problems we're Christian where'
[54:20] you get that that's
[54:23] right but being a Christian is the
[54:27] problem we are in spirit realm a new
[54:30] creation living in a natural realm in a
[54:33] human body that's right amen dealing
[54:36] with people that are of totally another
[54:39] creation that's right
[54:43] right it's bad enough just dealing with
[54:46] ourselves right PA said the things I
[54:49] would not I did I just told more but
[54:53] we're living in a world where 9 99.9% of
[54:56] the world is lost that's right they're
[54:59] of that old creation that old life
[55:02] that's
[55:03] right good people a lot of them that's
[55:07] natures and
[55:08] ways but they're not a part of this new
[55:10] race am why you have troubles that's
[55:14] right that's what brother R said in this
[55:18] creation he said our women don't cut
[55:20] their
[55:23] heart they don't Bight their
[55:28] don't put on back up that why cuz it's a
[55:31] new race that's right well if you see
[55:34] people around here got on like I always
[55:36] tell you sometimes you want to go to
[55:37] your wife and go lick your thumb and go
[55:39] over her face if it comes off dark color
[55:41] she got something on
[55:46] there well I just put on a little
[55:50] bit I try to be honest about that and
[55:54] then it gets me in trouble
[55:57] if you got a birth mark on your face now
[55:59] I know this going to be this going to
[56:00] get it people out there don't agree with
[56:03] it you got a birth mark on your face I
[56:05] don't see a thing in the world wrong
[56:06] with covering that birth mark up with
[56:12] makeup you ain't going to like that
[56:14] that's all right that's
[56:17] me but don't get spots on your face and
[56:20] try to cover them all up that's right I
[56:22] said a birk Mark that's right
[56:28] come on you make me say something I
[56:31] didn't say that's your lie that's
[56:34] right but my face is
[56:38] shiny it needs a little something to
[56:42] keep it from being too
[56:45] shiny well why don't you go rub some mud
[56:48] on
[56:49] you I sure stop it amen what I do I put
[56:54] my make up okay all right get off go
[57:00] ahead but listen Church we're supposed
[57:02] to be a new creation amen
[57:05] right what would God do I like that
[57:08] little thing they were you know the W
[57:10] whatever all
[57:11] on then what would God do and what would
[57:14] Jesus Christ
[57:17] do he said you don't never have no
[57:19] troubles hey I am
[57:23] trouble that's said that's what to
[57:26] say but I'm trying to get rid of
[57:29] myself and I have a lot of trouble doing
[57:32] it so you pray for me but I'm trying my
[57:35] best to get you and I to help each one
[57:37] of us amen that we can see Jesus Christ
[57:40] amen and not preach to you some kind of
[57:42] a gospel that you can never attain unto
[57:45] that's
[57:47] right see I believe it can be
[57:50] done all right but listen to what the
[57:52] prophet had to say now
[57:56] look at the lady you see in church age
[57:59] this is paragraph 117 but is preached
[58:01] 1960 12 11 the evening service to show
[58:05] that he was the first also he was he's
[58:08] the beginning of the creation of God oh
[58:10] do you catch it see how could he be
[58:13] created if he's a spirit how could he be
[58:18] he he's Eternal he never was created he
[58:22] never will be created because he was God
[58:25] at the beginning that's right but he
[58:28] that is the beginning of the creation of
[58:30] God was Jesus Christ when he was made
[58:34] manifest that's it when God lived in him
[58:38] he is God's creation oh my see the first
[58:42] and the last the amen the beginning of
[58:45] the creation of God when God created
[58:48] himself a body he come down and lived in
[58:50] it that's the beginning of the creation
[58:52] of God oh isn't he wonderful amen to the
[58:55] beginning of the creation of
[58:57] God and you
[59:02] know that when he was theophine and come
[59:06] forth from God logos or what you want to
[59:09] call it to create the
[59:12] world it was a new
[59:17] creation behold all things are made
[59:21] new all right he created a people
[59:24] Genesis 1:26 and
[59:28] 27 In His
[59:30] Image cuz he was a new
[59:33] creation but then he had to wait 6,000 I
[59:36] mean 4,000 years before he could bring
[59:39] that Genesis 126 and 27 man into being
[59:43] on the day of Pentecost in The Bride of
[59:45] Jesus
[59:47] Christ to separate himself among a group
[59:51] of
[59:51] people that we would be a new race a new
[59:55] people all
[59:56] right see but it would be Jesus Christ I
[59:59] hope you keep getting that point cuz
[1:00:00] that was what I want you to see
[1:00:03] yes that we were in had to be in
[1:00:08] him the only way we can have anything
[1:00:11] that's right is for us to be in him amen
[1:00:14] and that part of us that was in him is
[1:00:16] what the eternal life that we
[1:00:20] have not physically we were in him no
[1:00:25] you see a new creation then means it's
[1:00:27] got to be more we'll get down to read
[1:00:29] this on down a little
[1:00:31] further message why had to be Shepherds
[1:00:34] 1964
[1:00:35] 12-21 uh paragraph 98 he had started a
[1:00:39] new creation what was it a creation of
[1:00:44] himself that just leaves us totally out
[1:00:46] don't it that's what people don't
[1:00:48] like I don't like you tell it like it is
[1:00:52] oh but I've got to have something to do
[1:00:53] with it I've got to do you know TR be no
[1:00:56] it's just it's a creation of
[1:01:02] himself the Born Again believer is God
[1:01:05] made manifest that's right in a human
[1:01:08] body
[1:01:10] amen and God is pleased to dwell that's
[1:01:14] one of those scriptures see River Jordan
[1:01:16] he was pleased to dwell in Jesus right
[1:01:20] he's pleased to dwell in you if he gives
[1:01:21] you the new birth right
[1:01:26] I just can't seee pleas to dwell in me
[1:01:28] you don't believe what the Bible says
[1:01:30] that's true all right he had started a
[1:01:33] new creation what was it a creation of
[1:01:35] himself God was made flesh and dwell
[1:01:38] Among Us that's the Bible said in the
[1:01:40] beginning of the creation of God God was
[1:01:43] created in human form in Jesus Christ
[1:01:46] his son God dwelt he built his
[1:01:49] Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived
[1:01:52] in that Tabernacle God Emmanuel well God
[1:01:55] With Us he built himself a house to live
[1:01:57] in so that he could reflect his word to
[1:01:59] his subjects through that you know what
[1:02:02] God is when you see Christ all right now
[1:02:04] so he created a natural body and came to
[1:02:07] live in
[1:02:09] it right on the day of Pentecost he
[1:02:12] started a new
[1:02:15] creation by the new birth that he could
[1:02:18] come and live in us now what's he
[1:02:22] doing he's creating a was another body
[1:02:25] not a different body he's creating
[1:02:32] us right right he created a
[1:02:37] body he had to start in Us by created a
[1:02:40] spiritual form first right you couldn't
[1:02:44] come down and say cus you're the great
[1:02:46] you you're the high priest I I'll just
[1:02:48] make you a new creation no he wouldn't
[1:02:50] have it he killed the very one that
[1:02:51] brought it that's right
[1:02:55] but you see he started on the inside to
[1:02:59] work outwardly Amen to build a body that
[1:03:02] he could live
[1:03:05] in that's what's taking place
[1:03:07] today our problem is we don't yield it
[1:03:10] to him that's right H that's
[1:03:14] right I mean that's mine I don't know
[1:03:16] about you but that's my problem yes
[1:03:18] we'll get to it later on about the black
[1:03:21] dog white dog you know and the chief
[1:03:23] said back to me receive the Holy
[1:03:25] Ghost but he said which one win he
[1:03:29] says the one I feed the
[1:03:32] most well now you can't make the white
[1:03:34] dog and the black dog both of them in
[1:03:36] the same place that's right so you
[1:03:39] better make the white dog the Born Again
[1:03:41] experience and the black dog the outside
[1:03:43] of me that you're looking
[1:03:45] at now there's two people standing here
[1:03:49] there two
[1:03:52] dogs mhm but you see
[1:03:56] Church look what he's
[1:03:59] done look the next one proving his word
[1:04:03] 64816 paragraph 146 so he God came down
[1:04:08] after going through this and now ever
[1:04:12] son on that you
[1:04:14] eat and born of a natural sexual birth
[1:04:18] the way you come then when it comes to a
[1:04:22] place to where you go through water
[1:04:25] baptism then the Holy Ghost baptism then
[1:04:28] the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire
[1:04:30] baptism and claims his creation the same
[1:04:34] as it did
[1:04:39] him all
[1:04:42] right he claimed his body there on the
[1:04:45] River
[1:04:46] Jordan that didn't make his body
[1:04:50] Eternal by the new birth didn't make our
[1:04:52] body Eternal right
[1:04:56] but it laid a claim on it right we're
[1:04:58] not going to get another
[1:05:01] one like I've tried to explain to people
[1:05:03] and how do you if you're going to get a
[1:05:06] new body you better have a new world
[1:05:07] somewhere created to get it from cuz if
[1:05:10] it comes from here it's going to be part
[1:05:11] of the
[1:05:13] old so you better run to Jupiter Mars on
[1:05:17] these Russians or the United States you
[1:05:19] got to meet couple of maybe 100 million
[1:05:21] you can ride up there and stay up there
[1:05:26] silly
[1:05:28] a same as it did
[1:05:30] him the Holy Ghost and God is the same
[1:05:35] Spirit see it comes
[1:05:38] down and claims his body for the
[1:05:42] resurrection he was raised for our
[1:05:45] justification all the one Higher the
[1:05:48] head will ever
[1:05:51] perish this is the beginning of the
[1:05:54] creation of
[1:05:56] God excuse me that is the beginning of
[1:05:58] the creation of God this is the
[1:06:00] continuation of the creation of
[1:06:04] God you and I are the continuation you
[1:06:06] said we've read this many time I agree
[1:06:08] we will probably read some more
[1:06:11] too until we get
[1:06:14] it we're not a different
[1:06:20] creation we can't be a different
[1:06:22] creation right we got to be the same
[1:06:24] creation that's
[1:06:26] right all right cuz we're a different
[1:06:29] creation we'd be a new
[1:06:30] creation right different all right
[1:06:33] follow me then the whole earth has to
[1:06:35] have a baptism see it's going to be made
[1:06:39] Eternal and the Holy Ghost comes down in
[1:06:41] a city to dwell upon the earth and the
[1:06:44] Tabernacle of God is with man and dwells
[1:06:47] with them God has Tabernacle here on the
[1:06:49] earth this whole Redemption plan
[1:06:51] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:06:53] the Holy Ghost the same as it is as it
[1:06:57] is
[1:06:59] then now are you thinking New
[1:07:04] Creation super race he calls them the
[1:07:06] church H
[1:07:09] book super
[1:07:12] race different from the old
[1:07:17] race cuz now we have with the inside of
[1:07:21] us the life of God right makes us A
[1:07:25] different race of people amen it's like
[1:07:28] who was it if I quote it wrong get one
[1:07:30] but one of the Great Men down through
[1:07:32] time might have been Luther one of them
[1:07:34] walking down the street one day and and
[1:07:36] he asked this guy excuse me let us pass
[1:07:38] and man said I don't step aside for a
[1:07:40] fool he said always do step down the
[1:07:43] street walk around one of
[1:07:48] them different
[1:07:52] race but can we do do
[1:07:56] that can we do that to be A different
[1:08:00] race
[1:08:03] now for a minute I want to try to
[1:08:05] explain
[1:08:08] something cuz this means a lot to me
[1:08:12] into seeing a new creation new
[1:08:15] race and it destroys what most
[1:08:18] people in the message the way they
[1:08:22] preach you know that most people preach
[1:08:25] that Eve is a byproduct you've heard it
[1:08:29] right he just hamburg meat compared to
[1:08:33] us Porter House steaks men you
[1:08:36] know he's a
[1:08:42] byproduct and they'll only quote the
[1:08:44] things brother brandham says that leans
[1:08:47] it the way they want it to be
[1:08:52] leaned all right
[1:08:56] but you
[1:08:58] know
[1:09:01] Eve they quot a lot that she was not in
[1:09:03] the original
[1:09:11] creation but brother Ram said she was in
[1:09:14] the original creation right cuz she was
[1:09:16] in
[1:09:18] Adam the same one they want to quote
[1:09:22] from see they to down her and I know
[1:09:25] what brother Brown is
[1:09:28] doing I got it for this evening I may
[1:09:30] repeat this again I know what he's doing
[1:09:33] when he's talking about a by front
[1:09:36] up in one stage of what he's talking
[1:09:39] about he's giv her the greatest
[1:09:42] place that could ever
[1:09:46] be that she was not taken not like the
[1:09:49] other
[1:09:52] animals that she was in
[1:09:54] that's
[1:09:56] right because he said we was in Jesus
[1:10:00] Christ right you don't never hear that
[1:10:02] side
[1:10:05] preached the only preaching that she's a
[1:10:07] by
[1:10:10] product meaning she's not an original
[1:10:14] creation but now where was she
[1:10:19] at I know what he's saying he was not
[1:10:23] made physically when Adam was made
[1:10:26] physically that's right you know two
[1:10:28] people standing there two bodies one
[1:10:31] Adam one e she wasn't made that that's
[1:10:36] right but when Adam was created she was
[1:10:39] in Adam that's
[1:10:42] right is that true yes he didn't go out
[1:10:45] and get another pile of dirt and blow it
[1:10:47] together and make an eve out of
[1:10:49] it he went back to the original creation
[1:10:52] amen right
[1:10:55] cuz she was in Adam in that original
[1:10:57] creation that's
[1:10:59] right see at one time brother Ram is
[1:11:02] explaining the situation of how that by
[1:11:06] her coming to where she
[1:11:08] came that it made her with the
[1:11:11] possibility of being able to do
[1:11:15] wrong is that
[1:11:19] true
[1:11:22] all making her with the possibility
[1:11:24] because separating her
[1:11:27] right right I believe
[1:11:29] that and that way she's a by
[1:11:36] product but that's the way he's
[1:11:37] explaining
[1:11:39] her of the reason sin could enter the
[1:11:41] picture
[1:11:44] right but on the other hand he's
[1:11:47] explaining her as the wonderful
[1:11:50] beautiful bride of Adam right that's
[1:11:55] right that was not another creation that
[1:11:58] he had to go over somewhere else get him
[1:11:59] a wife bring over she's part of him
[1:12:02] that's right amen you don't hear that
[1:12:06] preached she's only condemning the woman
[1:12:10] they don't even go look up the word by
[1:12:12] product go look it
[1:12:19] up you go down here now and you can buy
[1:12:22] you a brand new what is it 50 something
[1:12:25] model Ford when is that Thunderbird or
[1:12:28] whatever it was 60 something or 50
[1:12:30] something Ford you can buy you a brand
[1:12:32] new
[1:12:35] one you know what it is it's a
[1:12:38] byproduct right that old Ford that was
[1:12:41] back
[1:12:43] there you don't even look up the word
[1:12:45] byproduct well bless God I know what it
[1:12:47] means it means go down dirty rotten
[1:12:50] sticking something where do you get it
[1:12:53] at
[1:12:57] the word byproduct means of equal value
[1:13:00] or great
[1:13:06] Torah you don't hear that do
[1:13:09] you brother I don't like you because you
[1:13:12] you you you you take up for the women I
[1:13:14] don't take up for women I take up for
[1:13:15] the bride of
[1:13:18] Christ they ain't nothing in the world
[1:13:20] no dirtier than a garbage Canin woman
[1:13:24] unless he'd be a garbage can man
[1:13:29] right right cuz remember he could have
[1:13:32] put her
[1:13:35] away he could have refused to took
[1:13:38] her the Bible doesn't say in Eve all die
[1:13:41] it's in Adam right amen Adam had a right
[1:13:44] to do what he could
[1:13:48] do we don't blame the
[1:13:52] woman
[1:13:54] this blame us
[1:13:58] all but get the point now
[1:14:02] yes on one side brother Brandon will be
[1:14:06] explaining the great
[1:14:08] beautiful position that Eve was
[1:14:12] in as to coming from
[1:14:16] Adam and not coming from another
[1:14:18] creation like the other animals had
[1:14:22] done and then another situation which is
[1:14:25] basically when he gets on over towards
[1:14:26] marriage and
[1:14:29] divorce and he's explaining them how
[1:14:32] that she was made to where she could
[1:14:37] fall and he calls her a
[1:14:41] byproduct you don't never read the
[1:14:47] message well bless God I just know it's
[1:14:49] a by product that's all it is see you
[1:14:51] won't study the message
[1:14:54] you won't compare the
[1:14:57] things brother R said the woman on one
[1:14:59] side is the most filthiest garbage can
[1:15:01] could ever
[1:15:03] be he said but on the other side she is
[1:15:06] a type of the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:15:09] most beautiful thing that could ever
[1:15:12] be which way you going to use
[1:15:14] it well bless God I'll use the way I
[1:15:17] want to go the
[1:15:22] hand cuz it ain't going to change that's
[1:15:25] but see when you face somebody like me
[1:15:26] you're going to have to face it one
[1:15:30] day cuz one day you'll hear this sermon
[1:15:32] again if you keep on with your ideas of
[1:15:35] of how that byproduct is just a garbage
[1:15:40] can and not see that it's the most
[1:15:43] wonderful beautiful thing that could
[1:15:44] ever
[1:15:46] be that God never went somewhere else
[1:15:48] and got something to make Eve out of he
[1:15:51] went right into his original creation
[1:15:54] that's right amen that's right and I
[1:15:59] thought come on I thought that a man and
[1:16:04] wife was a type of Christ in the church
[1:16:06] that's
[1:16:07] right I didn't know man and a garbage
[1:16:17] can you know what a man in the garbage
[1:16:19] can's got two garbage
[1:16:22] cans
[1:16:28] you we're not talking
[1:16:31] silly talking
[1:16:34] straight you would follow me about the
[1:16:36] new
[1:16:41] creation but you see this is laying a
[1:16:43] foundation to understand how these
[1:16:45] bodies can be
[1:16:49] changed that's what I'm
[1:16:51] doing all right
[1:16:54] I'm talking about a change of the
[1:16:59] body but see to look at it in the
[1:17:01] original then you see Adam and Eve was
[1:17:03] the
[1:17:05] same
[1:17:09] DNA right you going to argue the
[1:17:14] point come on what would it
[1:17:17] be come on we got a couple of nurses
[1:17:20] sitting
[1:17:22] here
[1:17:24] if Eve come out of Adam she's the same
[1:17:26] DNA as Adam
[1:17:32] right but all they got to find is a
[1:17:35] little old piece of bone or some kind of
[1:17:36] something they can get it all
[1:17:41] back but see her problem wasn't when she
[1:17:43] took somebody besides
[1:17:45] Adam right right
[1:17:50] right had it been that it was going to
[1:17:52] be natural multiplication from Adam and
[1:17:55] Eve you argue that I'm not even never
[1:17:57] worried about it cuz it it didn't happen
[1:17:59] anyway but had it being that there were
[1:18:01] going to be without sin you know that we
[1:18:05] would all come with the same
[1:18:10] DNA because Adam and Eve had the same
[1:18:13] DNA what are you going to make
[1:18:16] it oh on you get into all these
[1:18:18] technical points of this that get into
[1:18:20] all the technical points do all you want
[1:18:21] to with it but you know what I'm talking
[1:18:23] about the
[1:18:26] truth but see where the problem was is
[1:18:29] when Eve
[1:18:30] mixed and brought forth another DNA
[1:18:35] right right and that started all of this
[1:18:37] mess up in the DNA because we would have
[1:18:40] all been the same DNA we would have all
[1:18:42] been the same blood type we would have
[1:18:43] all been the
[1:18:46] same and it not been a fault you don't
[1:18:49] think
[1:18:50] sensible explain something else to deid
[1:18:53] that to be the
[1:18:58] truth so Eve was a part of
[1:19:06] Adam the Bible
[1:19:10] says she is now bone of my
[1:19:15] bone and Flesh of My
[1:19:21] Flesh
[1:19:23] brother random
[1:19:26] said she was Body Spirit and
[1:19:33] show a part of
[1:19:40] Adam
[1:19:42] okay so now we're talking about a new
[1:19:46] creation to Adam was a natural New
[1:19:51] Creation
[1:19:54] it was the beginning of the human race
[1:19:58] right and Eve wasn't made a byproduct to
[1:20:01] take AP part of the dirt maker like the
[1:20:03] other
[1:20:05] animals so we only deal man the
[1:20:08] preachers only deal with trying to make
[1:20:09] her some garbage can to prove Show sex
[1:20:12] or whatever this is and and whatever do
[1:20:14] they don't go to the point of seeing who
[1:20:15] she really
[1:20:21] was I don't understand all about it no
[1:20:24] claim to but brother Maloney said the
[1:20:26] Greek Bears out that a woman means a man
[1:20:29] with a wound w m
[1:20:32] b wound to reproduce
[1:20:35] himself Eve was not given to reproduce
[1:20:39] Eve she was given to reproduce Adam
[1:20:45] right she was not to bring forth hers
[1:20:48] that's where she messed it
[1:20:51] up New Creation let me get in a
[1:21:01] hurry I'll be glad to give you these
[1:21:04] let's go with the first one Brothers
[1:21:06] we'll get one or two and then you can
[1:21:08] have the rest of these I'll copy them
[1:21:09] off for you if you want but go to the
[1:21:11] marriage of the Lamb number six
[1:21:14] paragraph
[1:21:15] 10862 121
[1:21:19] e now look it's so perfect that when God
[1:21:22] took took and made a man and to show
[1:21:25] that he did not want it out of anything
[1:21:29] different the woman was not in the
[1:21:31] original
[1:21:33] creation so she is not in the creation
[1:21:38] what but she's a part of
[1:21:41] Adam she's a
[1:21:43] byproduct he goes into the side of Adam
[1:21:46] not to make another creature but taking
[1:21:49] part of a creature and make another
[1:21:52] creature out of it he took the and he
[1:21:54] took the masculine spirit that was in
[1:21:56] Adam and he took the feminine spirit
[1:21:58] that was in Adam rather and put it over
[1:22:01] into the woman so both
[1:22:04] spirit and
[1:22:06] body they become
[1:22:13] one now if you don't agree with that
[1:22:16] then you better annihilate the rest of
[1:22:18] this down below here you better race
[1:22:20] this off okay take that off if you don't
[1:22:26] agree why said it was a beautiful type
[1:22:30] to what God did at
[1:22:34] Calvary he took Christ and connected him
[1:22:37] with the church through a Riven side he
[1:22:41] brought the blood that cleansed the
[1:22:42] person that sanctifies the Flesh of the
[1:22:45] church and puts the spirit of the Living
[1:22:48] God and he took of the Cross off the
[1:22:51] cross there out of Christ and puts it
[1:22:54] into the individual then they are one
[1:22:57] they become one Christ and you are one
[1:23:04] amen
[1:23:06] now don't sound like he was too
[1:23:10] dirty look at the next Masterpiece 64
[1:23:13] paragraph 101 64
[1:23:18] 705 let us not forget that in the
[1:23:20] beginning that when he smoked the side
[1:23:22] of Adam he took something from this side
[1:23:26] now the spining of Christ was for a
[1:23:28] cause that he might take from him one to
[1:23:31] be a family the bride he might take him
[1:23:34] a bride so when the Masterpiece was
[1:23:37] perfected then he had to Smite it to
[1:23:39] take from him not another piece not
[1:23:43] another
[1:23:44] creation but of the same creation you
[1:23:47] say amen I agree with that that's that
[1:23:49] we're part of
[1:23:51] God he's
[1:23:53] explaining what happened with Adam and
[1:23:56] Eve
[1:24:00] right my brother don't think bad at this
[1:24:04] but think a minute if he took from him
[1:24:08] the original creation to make the bride
[1:24:10] for him he never made another creation
[1:24:14] he took a part of the original creation
[1:24:16] then if he was a word what must the
[1:24:18] bride be it's got to be the original
[1:24:20] word Living God in the word
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:29] right jump down to let's go to number
[1:24:33] eight brothers but we'll drop down to
[1:24:35] paragraph
[1:24:39] 829 up the one where's questions and
[1:24:41] answers 57 106 we go down to where it
[1:24:45] says paragraph 829 because I'm trying to
[1:24:47] cut it short okay and Adam was lonesome
[1:24:53] and God to show that they could not be
[1:24:57] separated now I'm going to get back into
[1:24:59] this same thing just a second look he
[1:25:02] never went and got dirt and made an eve
[1:25:04] but he made from the original dirt
[1:25:07] Adam he took a rib from his side and
[1:25:09] made him a helpmate and that was Eve she
[1:25:13] was made for the man and part of the man
[1:25:16] she was a part of him in the beginning
[1:25:18] and the creation in the ofing
[1:25:24] are you
[1:25:28] reading she was in him in
[1:25:32] theophany she was part of him down here
[1:25:34] in this
[1:25:38] creation she could not be divided into
[1:25:41] another creation she had to be be made
[1:25:43] in the same
[1:25:45] creation he said because that's the same
[1:25:47] thing about the other let's see if I can
[1:25:49] find the other
[1:25:51] one but she would part of him in
[1:25:58] theophany look at the next
[1:26:01] one questions and answers number nine
[1:26:03] brother uh
[1:26:06] 639 God in the
[1:26:08] beginning when he know that man and
[1:26:10] woman was made one not two they were
[1:26:13] made
[1:26:14] one they were separated one put in
[1:26:18] flesh and one under
[1:26:21] theophany
[1:26:23] okay he knew that so in order to prove
[1:26:26] that to you when God made the woman he
[1:26:29] never took some of some took some dust
[1:26:32] and made her like he did the man he took
[1:26:34] a rib out of the side of Adam and she
[1:26:37] become a byproduct of a man because
[1:26:39] she's part of him you get it
[1:26:47] now
[1:26:51] so
[1:26:53] Eve was Body Spirit and
[1:26:57] soul a part of
[1:27:01] Adam you said well you're saying Soul
[1:27:04] well
[1:27:06] theophany you know how I've always
[1:27:08] preached it when he put her in flesh she
[1:27:10] had to have her own
[1:27:14] soul CU she would have it wouldn't have
[1:27:16] been Eve so he gave her body spirit and
[1:27:21] soul
[1:27:23] but do you think Adam is the only one
[1:27:24] that had eternal
[1:27:30] life we can prove Adam had eternal life
[1:27:32] right blackmans
[1:27:34] night but what about
[1:27:40] Eve brother Rand W marriage and
[1:27:44] divorce he said if you get a
[1:27:48] revelation that that is your
[1:27:51] wife
[1:27:54] he said that's your wife for
[1:27:57] life he said not watch some drunken
[1:28:00] magistrate joined
[1:28:05] together he say but if you get a
[1:28:11] revelation and how you going to get a
[1:28:13] revelation by the new birth right and
[1:28:16] the new birth then is going to make us
[1:28:18] all
[1:28:20] one that's why Genesis 1 26 and 27 is
[1:28:23] just one Soul one
[1:28:26] theoy an ever born again Believer by the
[1:28:29] new
[1:28:31] birth that's the life of
[1:28:34] God
[1:28:35] right and by having the life of God our
[1:28:38] soul is our theop
[1:28:41] then amen but all brother it's up you
[1:28:44] some words that's the positive of God's
[1:28:46] mind that's just like the new birth down
[1:28:49] at the bottom of the pyramid when you're
[1:28:50] right here at the new birth
[1:28:52] God believes and shows you're going to
[1:28:53] be up here he keeps pulling on you
[1:28:56] that's right it's drawing you
[1:28:59] amen but see Eve was in
[1:29:02] Adam not another
[1:29:05] creation like I said then I'll repeat it
[1:29:07] where people
[1:29:08] understand in one case brother Brandon
[1:29:11] will be explaining Eve as the most
[1:29:13] beautiful part of Adam that even in Theo
[1:29:15] in theop and I gave you the quote there
[1:29:17] where he said part of Adam was still in
[1:29:19] theophany where was it at was up in you
[1:29:22] know was it was
[1:29:26] Eve and it Eve was in Adam and
[1:29:33] theop but see on the other hand he'll
[1:29:35] explain how dirty she is and how that
[1:29:38] she
[1:29:38] was not an original creation because
[1:29:42] none of the original creation could
[1:29:46] fall the dog can't fall the horse can't
[1:29:49] fall the animals can't fall
[1:29:53] they're just for
[1:29:54] reproduction right but the woman is a
[1:29:57] human sexual garbage
[1:30:00] can but she's also a type of the Bride
[1:30:04] of Jesus Christ so which one we going to
[1:30:06] make
[1:30:08] it are you listening New
[1:30:12] Creation we're a new
[1:30:14] creation by the new birth that's
[1:30:19] right Adam was a creation Eve was in
[1:30:23] Adam Adam Eve was taken from Adam a part
[1:30:27] of the original
[1:30:29] creation that's
[1:30:32] right wonderful
[1:30:35] position you sisters have a wonderful
[1:30:39] place because you are a type of the
[1:30:42] bride of
[1:30:46] Christ live it and walk
[1:30:50] it but see you can be the type of the
[1:30:53] most gar most filthy garbage Canin
[1:30:55] that's ever been on so you have a
[1:31:00] choice you have a choice to be what you
[1:31:02] want to be we have a choice to be a new
[1:31:04] creature in Christ
[1:31:06] Jesus we can die out to ourselves and
[1:31:08] become born
[1:31:10] again and then we realize if we have
[1:31:13] eternal
[1:31:14] life then that eternal life never had a
[1:31:19] beginning so then if that eternal life
[1:31:21] never had a beginning then the eternal
[1:31:23] life that I have now in my soul is a
[1:31:25] part of God Amen and always was a part
[1:31:28] of God the Eternal life that I
[1:31:32] have cuz he's made me a new creation
[1:31:37] amen we were all the natural creation by
[1:31:41] birth right but by a new birth we become
[1:31:45] the spiritual
[1:31:50] creation the body of Jesus
[1:31:53] Christ a body thou Hast prepared me what
[1:31:56] just talking about Jesus the body he's
[1:32:00] talking about you and I cuz we're his
[1:32:04] body we have the opportunity to die to
[1:32:07] ourselves and accept Jesus Christ as our
[1:32:09] savior and become part of this new
[1:32:11] creation or we can go on with our mental
[1:32:15] attitude and stay
[1:32:18] lost why is it that I said the other day
[1:32:21] that that people do what the Bible says
[1:32:23] but God don't save them the Bible says
[1:32:25] if you believe in your heart confess
[1:32:26] with your mouth you're
[1:32:29] saved that's good bapst theology but
[1:32:31] it's the Bible which is true and if
[1:32:34] you're really right about it sincere
[1:32:36] you're going to be saved
[1:32:40] right but not just because everybody
[1:32:42] says it that's right
[1:32:47] right cuz this is a new race of people
[1:32:51] what about an opportunity to be of a new
[1:32:54] race you know what I think about I used
[1:32:56] to as a young man I used to think about
[1:32:59] oh it would be nice you know to inherit
[1:33:01] maybe a100 million doar you know and I
[1:33:04] could buy this and buy that and build a
[1:33:06] new church and we can have this we can
[1:33:07] do it I just go through and my mind just
[1:33:09] runs all the time like yeah I know yours
[1:33:11] don't but that's just mine you know just
[1:33:15] runs all the time you know and just you
[1:33:17] know and
[1:33:19] uh but you know what
[1:33:22] I was thinking the other day I thought
[1:33:24] what would I do if I had $100
[1:33:26] million I don't really
[1:33:31] care what go
[1:33:34] sister G I mean somebody just come along
[1:33:38] and give you $100
[1:33:40] million it wouldn't change thing would
[1:33:43] it it wouldn't make a r will go out no
[1:33:46] you could go down the house took
[1:33:49] out but they're still there
[1:33:52] it wouldn't change a
[1:33:56] thing you know
[1:33:58] what maybe one of these days we'll
[1:34:01] understand what Paul
[1:34:03] said he had come to a place that he said
[1:34:06] whatever state that I'm
[1:34:09] in there are to be content
[1:34:13] right that don't mean New York or
[1:34:16] Georgia
[1:34:18] either that's your spiritual condition
[1:34:23] to own the whole world lose your soul
[1:34:25] come on brother wouldn't be worth
[1:34:27] nothing what good would money
[1:34:29] do I just give it
[1:34:31] away you know why I give it away cuz I
[1:34:34] know it ain't going to last
[1:34:36] long it wouldn't matter because I a go
[1:34:39] life long you
[1:34:42] know but what it
[1:34:50] matter well we get to realize we're a
[1:34:52] new creature

[1:34:58] possibility you know what this message

[1:35:04] possibility that my body could be
[1:35:06] changed thank you Lord a
[1:35:10] possibility that I'd get to see my
[1:35:15] savior a possibility that I could live
[1:35:20] eternally
[1:35:22] then who'd worry about millions of
[1:35:25] dollars but I'm just like brother
