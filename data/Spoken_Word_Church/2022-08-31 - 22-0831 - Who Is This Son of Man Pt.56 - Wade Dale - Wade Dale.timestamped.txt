[10:57] who is this son of man part 56 i want to
[10:59] bring something a little bit this
[11:00] afternoon or this evening
[11:02] that kind of struck me i was um
[11:05] looking at some things and sometimes
[11:06] when you look at something you go man
[11:07] that looks just like and then
[11:09] boom there it is but i want to read you
[11:11] this is my quote of the day from it is i
[11:14] be not afraid 1954 brother brown said
[11:16] now moses had
[11:18] had less than the boy talking about the
[11:19] boy the boy had some food he was talking
[11:21] about a uh
[11:23] the boy that had the five loaves and the
[11:24] fishes the boy had some food moses had a
[11:27] dry stick in his hands what we've been
[11:28] talking about we've been talking about
[11:30] that aaron's rod
[11:33] in moses hand it was nothing else but a
[11:36] stick that he'd picked up perhaps on the
[11:38] desert
[11:39] but once when that hand of faith took a
[11:41] hold of that stick
[11:43] it became god's judgment rod
[11:46] to the world
[11:48] what a difference a position makes and
[11:50] that's what we're going to talk about
[11:51] tonight later on and then next sunday
[11:53] about because we gotta start up the
[11:54] statue of perfect man we're going to
[11:56] look at position
[11:57] because it's got to be a position
[11:59] and tonight we're going to talk about
[12:00] three different things about the cross
[12:02] and i i think you'll see
[12:04] why this is a progressive revelation
[12:06] this is a progressive message and it
[12:08] took a progressive message
[12:10] to bring us up the statue of perfect man
[12:12] and then once you get in the statue of
[12:13] perfect man it brings you to another
[12:15] level and the son of man revelation
[12:17] because remember we're still in the son
[12:19] of god
[12:20] dispensation under the baptism of the
[12:22] holy ghost but we are under the son of
[12:25] man
[12:26] dispensation as far as the opening of
[12:27] the word when those seals open that put
[12:29] us in a different class brother brown
[12:32] even calls us i'll read it this weekend
[12:34] brother brown says
[12:35] a different class of people you are a
[12:38] different class of people
[12:40] one with prophetic insight
[12:44] wow
[12:45] have you ever tried to use that
[12:48] moses stretched that rod he stretched
[12:50] the rod over the sea he stretched it in
[12:52] the air it was god's judgment rod
[12:54] those egyptians could have ever got that
[12:56] rod from moses they'd had the israelites
[12:59] whipped boy look that's a physical stick
[13:03] and what that's what takes today as the
[13:05] rod was in moses's hand so is the name
[13:08] of jesus christ in the church's hand
[13:12] oh my
[13:14] you know you hear people and
[13:16] i was looking at some comments and
[13:18] people made online and different things
[13:20] about uh you know you say well
[13:23] god
[13:24] protected me
[13:27] what god
[13:30] you always talk to people that are not
[13:31] real christians they kind of let in
[13:32] between they talk about god
[13:34] they can't call jesus christ's name
[13:35] because that gets too personal
[13:37] but they can say god do you understand
[13:38] what i'm saying they can say god and it
[13:40] could be a stick a tree a house but when
[13:42] you change jesus christ it brings it to
[13:44] a person
[13:45] all right so we have the name of jesus
[13:47] christ the correct way the correct water
[13:49] baptism we know he's not a third person
[13:51] the trinity we know he's not a second
[13:53] person of the trinity we know that he's
[13:54] almighty god in human flesh
[13:57] all right so what is the name of jesus
[13:58] christ in the church hand if the church
[14:00] will hold that name of jesus esteem it
[14:03] and honor it and quit using it in slang
[14:07] and so forth see the world they use that
[14:09] name all the time they use it in a slang
[14:11] word
[14:12] amen
[14:13] and use it in power though us use it in
[14:16] power and reverence
[14:19] it will conquer every enemy that god
[14:22] that god's got on earth every enemy
[14:26] in my name they shall cast out devils
[14:29] you didn't say god
[14:31] you can say father son holy ghost all
[14:33] the time you want to the devil's not
[14:34] going to move but when you say in the
[14:36] name of the lord jesus christ
[14:38] that brings a personality involved that
[14:40] brings a person in my name they shall
[14:42] cast out devils in my name they shall
[14:45] lay hands on the sick
[14:46] all these things
[14:48] in
[14:49] his name let's bow our heads
[14:52] lord thank you for this evening that you
[14:53] give us
[14:54] we pray now that you settle this lord
[14:56] help us lord to speak what we got on our
[14:59] heart to the people and father we pray
[15:01] that you should be the ones that are
[15:02] sick
[15:02] be the ones lord are not with us lord
[15:04] for different reasons father we pray
[15:06] that you'd go and minister to them
[15:09] lord we know that some are sin sick some
[15:11] are backslid
[15:12] some are just struggling with life lord
[15:14] and i pray that you just comfort each
[15:16] one father be with us here tonight lord
[15:18] anyone in this building that's sick or
[15:21] are a little bit troubled on different
[15:22] things lord may the holy spirit come in
[15:24] with that salve and just relieve the
[15:27] relieve the pain father because this
[15:29] earth is just nothing but pain
[15:31] and lord i pray that you should be with
[15:33] us and bless us and forgive us of our
[15:34] sins lord in the furthermore this
[15:35] service be the ones that are that are
[15:37] watching in and listening in lord we
[15:39] pray that you'll just be with them lord
[15:41] sanctify us for this journey in jesus
[15:42] name we pray
[15:44] amen let's read this one scripture and
[15:46] you'll be seated john 1 1. in the
[15:47] beginning was the word the word was with
[15:49] god and the word was god
[15:52] and the word was made flesh has that
[15:54] become more real to you
[15:56] and the word became flesh
[16:00] personal so who was that who was the
[16:02] word who was the flesh of god all jesus
[16:05] christ so it all comes back bro johnny
[16:07] you got to say jesus and you know who he
[16:09] is
[16:11] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[16:13] among us and we beheld his glory the
[16:14] glory of the only begotten of the father
[16:17] full of grace and truth you may be
[16:18] seated in the lord as blessing to the
[16:20] reading of the word and as we get
[16:21] started
[16:23] in this i got this little thing around
[16:24] my finger and i don't know who in the
[16:25] world i don't know whether it was some
[16:27] young child or something but i was
[16:29] driving the other day and
[16:31] and we were going down the road and
[16:33] this little thing was on my antenna
[16:36] and and as i was driving brother bob it
[16:38] starts going up the antenna
[16:40] then it starts spinning around so which
[16:42] one of you children did this i like it
[16:45] i'm gonna go put it back on there
[16:48] hey sophia
[16:50] oh you pointed at jonas i knew you'd
[16:52] tell
[16:54] all i had to do was say hey
[16:56] all right lily i thought maybe it was
[16:58] lily back there in the back she was
[16:59] smiling but she probably knew who did it
[17:01] too
[17:02] so i figured it was somebody a little
[17:04] bit taller than those girls a little bit
[17:06] taller that could reach and put jonas
[17:08] don't look back in the back there's
[17:09] nobody back there with you buddy
[17:12] so thank you very much it was very
[17:13] entertaining and i'm going to put it
[17:14] back on there
[17:16] because you made it where it'll go
[17:17] almost to the top and and won't go any
[17:19] further and then when i get slower it
[17:21] drops down so thank you for that i'm
[17:22] gonna wear it on my finger if that's all
[17:24] right
[17:24] first thessalonians 4 4 says that every
[17:26] one of you should know how to possess
[17:28] his vessel in sanctification and honor
[17:30] and the reason the reason i keep reading
[17:31] this it's more to me it's like a
[17:33] training exercise we are in a training
[17:36] exercise you and i are training
[17:39] every sunday every wednesday every time
[17:41] you read the bible every time you pray
[17:43] you are in training because listen this
[17:45] is a battle you don't fight a battle you
[17:47] don't just jump up out of the
[17:49] out of kindergarten and start fighting
[17:51] battles
[17:52] know what brother donnie how many weeks
[17:54] do you go to
[17:55] six weeks
[17:57] six weeks of just rigorous just to get
[18:00] in the army six weeks of training six
[18:02] weeks and and they call it hell on earth
[18:05] and that's naturally
[18:07] but what about spiritually listen you're
[18:09] in a fight for your life from the
[18:10] beginning of the time that you come into
[18:12] this world you are in a fight
[18:15] every one of us is in a fight and we got
[18:16] to know how to fight
[18:18] and who to fight
[18:20] amen
[18:21] well i think we've been told how to
[18:22] fight
[18:23] and i think we've been told who to fight
[18:25] because the brother brown tells us that
[18:27] we now have satan's answer well what's
[18:29] the question
[18:31] who is he
[18:32] where is he
[18:33] and what's he doing
[18:35] the same way as when jesus christ was
[18:36] revealed in the seals when the seals was
[18:38] opened what did it do when that door
[18:40] opened when that seal opened outran the
[18:42] devil
[18:45] outran the devil
[18:47] four times out the devil just kept going
[18:49] away going away going away well that's
[18:51] what we're looking at now we're we're
[18:53] looking at the unclean spirit going out
[18:54] of a man on in justification
[18:56] sanctification
[18:58] then we're looking at sanctification
[18:59] even still more
[19:00] as we go up this statue of a perfect man
[19:02] but there's something we got to realize
[19:05] that when we get to a certain place this
[19:07] is what we got to see that's what we're
[19:09] going to look at this afternoon
[19:11] so but every one of you should know how
[19:13] to possess his vessel donnie knows how
[19:15] to take an engine apart and put it back
[19:17] together
[19:20] bob
[19:24] donny
[19:25] right
[19:27] huh
[19:28] may not even know if it's under the hood
[19:30] or the or the trunk
[19:32] i'm talking about him not you
[19:34] okay
[19:35] but why training he's done it a hundred
[19:38] times could do it with his eyes closed
[19:39] bob's done it none he just calls it he
[19:41] just calls the guy to come fix it right
[19:43] why there's not he's not learned
[19:46] in that place well now you and i gotta
[19:48] learn i know we've given all we've been
[19:49] given these virtues
[19:52] but brother brown said without the holy
[19:55] ghost these virtues are a stumbling
[19:56] block to the believer
[19:58] all right and even the unbeliever
[20:01] all right somebody with me that's why
[20:02] you see people falling away you see
[20:04] people that don't grow you see people
[20:06] that backslide they stay backslid all
[20:08] the time
[20:11] they're not here tonight
[20:15] one more time right
[20:17] hey man
[20:19] so we got to know how to possess our
[20:20] vessel in sanctification
[20:23] and honor romans 12 2 says be not
[20:25] conformed to this world but be
[20:26] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[20:29] i was thinking the other day
[20:32] you know
[20:33] we can't help the things that go into
[20:34] our mind
[20:36] everybody with me on that we you can't
[20:37] help what goes into your mind but you
[20:39] can help what you meditate on used to
[20:41] you would meditate on that what i'm
[20:44] going to do friday night
[20:46] and there's a there's a christian song
[20:48] that's that's that's on the radio now
[20:50] contemporary christian song that talks
[20:52] about thank god for sunday morning
[20:57] i thank god for every morning
[21:00] but they put so much emphasis on getting
[21:01] to church well you know what i did when
[21:03] i was out in the world sunday was my
[21:04] checkup day i checked up make sure i was
[21:06] still alive
[21:09] i had other things on my mind my mind
[21:12] was toward the world and the things of
[21:14] the world on sunday was just kind of my
[21:16] reboot day that i rebooted and got ready
[21:19] for monday
[21:21] well now what is it my sunday now is
[21:23] yeah it's a reboot but it's a renewing
[21:26] of my mind it brings me back and reminds
[21:28] me of things the ministers all the
[21:31] ministers and and even testimonies it
[21:33] should bring back in your memory the
[21:34] good parts
[21:36] amen the good parts that we've lived
[21:38] through
[21:39] we remember the bad listen devil will
[21:41] never let you forget the bad parts but
[21:44] let's start dwelling on the good parts
[21:47] by the renewing of your mind so when you
[21:48] come to church you shouldn't even have
[21:50] the mind you had out there
[21:52] you should let the holy ghost take over
[21:54] let him raise up a little bit higher
[21:56] inside of you and let him take over and
[22:00] teach us something because that's the
[22:01] only way we're going to make it
[22:03] because no man can teach you the bible
[22:05] tells us no man teach you anything
[22:07] right
[22:08] but the holy ghost inside of you will
[22:10] agree with the word put a teacher or a
[22:12] preacher in the pulpit and then that
[22:14] teacher inside of you will say that
[22:16] ain't nothing but the truth or that
[22:18] brother don't know what he's talking
[22:19] about all right
[22:21] but only by the renewing of your mind
[22:23] are we going to go up this statue of a
[22:24] perfect man because it's like i said
[22:26] before this is abnormal
[22:28] it's not even hardly human it's more
[22:30] supernatural than it is natural
[22:33] everybody with me
[22:34] because virtue is not a natural not
[22:36] having a
[22:38] intercourse you know being a virgin
[22:40] that's good commendable should be done
[22:42] that way
[22:43] but
[22:44] that virtue is strength and power
[22:47] and the beginning of character that we
[22:50] have to build up inside of ourself so
[22:52] that so that you know you have
[22:54] confidence when brother donnie calls
[22:56] brother dale or we call brother dale or
[22:58] we call
[22:59] some of the ministers and we have
[23:00] confidence that that person will either
[23:02] give us an answer or go to god and get
[23:05] us an answer or or have the answer
[23:07] already
[23:08] well see that's virtue that to me that
[23:10] strength that's power you wouldn't want
[23:12] i wouldn't want to call now my
[23:13] postmatcher she's a wonderful lady it's
[23:16] really nice super nice very very
[23:18] reverent in
[23:20] in as far as letting me off and doing
[23:22] things that i need to do
[23:24] but i'm not going to call her and ask
[23:25] yourself what's that scripture mean
[23:27] are you
[23:29] right there's no virtue there there's no
[23:31] strength in that
[23:32] amen
[23:34] that's why bro that's why jesus brought
[23:35] brother jesus that's why jesus told us
[23:37] that you shall receive power dunamis or
[23:40] dynamite you you're gonna you're gonna
[23:42] receive power once the holy ghost comes
[23:44] upon you and that will give you strength
[23:47] what the strength of you no the strength
[23:48] of god and what is god he's the word so
[23:52] the strength is in the word of god
[23:54] everybody with me so you'll be
[23:55] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[23:57] look that you may prove
[23:59] you got to prove
[24:01] amen
[24:02] we're going to see a transfer of power
[24:04] here in a few minutes that was one of
[24:06] the most powerful things ever happened
[24:08] on the face of the earth when jesus
[24:10] christ was crucified on a cross
[24:14] but there's another part to that
[24:16] there's a furtherment of that
[24:20] because he talks about taking up your
[24:23] cross
[24:24] you don't have to hang on a cross
[24:26] he's already hung on the cross for you
[24:28] but you got to take up your cross
[24:31] and follow him we'll get to that in a
[24:32] minute but we know the first stage is
[24:34] the birth we've been on that i want to
[24:36] make sure that we understand if we're
[24:39] not going we cannot go up that statue of
[24:41] perfect man without having the new birth
[24:44] you can go so far with your peacock
[24:46] feathers
[24:48] or stuck in your blackbird everybody
[24:51] with me
[24:52] but you want sooner or later these
[24:54] feathers are going to come out
[24:56] power without character
[24:58] amen that's what we're looking at we're
[25:00] looking at a lot of people that thought
[25:02] they had a lot of power people like tim
[25:04] humes and him and i was a man calling
[25:05] his name prayed for the sick cast out
[25:07] devils did many mighty works but he
[25:09] turned the message down
[25:13] what are you going to do with that
[25:16] gifts and callings
[25:18] are without repentance
[25:22] balaam knew how to get an audience with
[25:24] god
[25:26] satan knows how to get an audience with
[25:28] god
[25:29] talks to him lip there all the time
[25:32] what about me and you sometimes we can't
[25:33] get anything
[25:37] right
[25:38] so gifts and callings but now these
[25:40] these virtues we're going to look at
[25:43] when brother brown talks about them
[25:44] being molded and the bible talks about
[25:46] compacted
[25:49] when when tnm and all you know you see
[25:50] people do foundation built foundations
[25:52] another brother gary's done it too but
[25:55] but do you just put it on sand and just
[25:57] just start pouring
[25:59] no you compact that place that you're
[26:01] gonna use have you ever watched them
[26:03] build a bridge
[26:05] they take that big thing up in the top
[26:07] with a great big hammer looks like and
[26:10] what do they do they drive that
[26:12] i-beam
[26:13] all the way down until it hits solid
[26:15] something
[26:17] well that's hitting solid ground and you
[26:19] know what that bridge will be there for
[26:21] 100 years but if you just tap it down
[26:24] there just about three or four feet
[26:25] could you imagine
[26:27] that bridge would collapse before they
[26:28] even got it built the weight of the
[26:29] bridge would take it down so i don't
[26:31] want the weight of sin to bring us down
[26:33] if we just sit there and tap our little
[26:35] foundation down in the ground about this
[26:36] part i want us to be rooted the bible
[26:38] says rooted and grounded
[26:40] all right it's what we're talking about
[26:42] last time we preached we talked about
[26:44] being
[26:45] grounded
[26:46] stuck in the ground you know rooted
[26:49] by the rivers of living water romans 8
[26:52] verse 14 says many are lived by the
[26:54] spirit of god
[26:55] they are the sons of god for you have
[26:57] not received the spirit of bondage again
[26:59] to fear
[27:00] but you have received the spirit of
[27:01] adoption whereby we cry
[27:03] have a father that adoption
[27:05] is what adoption is your placing so each
[27:08] one of these are going to be a placing
[27:10] it's going to be you're going to be
[27:11] placed into the body
[27:13] absolutely placed in the body as the sun
[27:15] if you're born again
[27:17] with all the privileges heirs and
[27:19] joiners right here with
[27:21] spirit itself bear witness with our
[27:22] spirit that what that we are the
[27:24] children of god and if children then
[27:26] heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with
[27:28] christ whatever he's got we got and this
[27:30] is him this is his character so he has
[27:33] give us an opportunity to take on his
[27:36] character
[27:37] all right
[27:38] but you only can do it by
[27:40] justification sanctification in the
[27:42] baptism of the holy ghost you cannot do
[27:43] it any other way you can't just wake up
[27:45] one day and say i had this in me all
[27:48] along
[27:49] it's just coming to life yeah there's
[27:51] something coming to life all right
[27:53] but you gotta have like brother keith
[27:55] reed says an experience
[27:58] i like what brother keith puts that
[27:59] empathy so you gotta have an experience
[28:02] of god you gotta have an experience
[28:05] and man it don't have to be
[28:07] you don't have to be shouting and
[28:09] jumping up and down and running all over
[28:10] the all over the place but you gotta
[28:11] have an experience you gotta have
[28:13] something where you can say hey that's
[28:14] where god revealed himself to me and
[28:18] started putting the word together
[28:20] started helping me put the word together
[28:22] amen
[28:24] because before that what did we do you
[28:25] took the denomination they said well we
[28:27] think he said this we think he meant
[28:28] that well i don't know how to explain
[28:30] the trinity
[28:31] ask somebody
[28:33] explain the trinity
[28:36] yeah you better take a couple hours
[28:37] because they're going to have to they're
[28:38] going to be uh
[28:41] amen
[28:43] but we know what it is
[28:45] and it's so plain and simple it goes
[28:47] right over their head it goes right over
[28:49] the scholars when brother bran was
[28:50] preaching to those scholars i'm sure
[28:52] they're they're they're thinking and
[28:53] their their their foundation
[28:56] was on that doctrine
[28:59] if you deny the father you deny the son
[29:01] if you die of the son you deny the
[29:02] father oh that's right
[29:05] you got to have the father son and holy
[29:06] ghost just like you've got to have
[29:07] justification sanctification baptism
[29:09] holy ghost you got to put them all
[29:10] together to make one god
[29:13] we know that
[29:14] then now we talked about giving you a
[29:16] new spirit does everybody understand
[29:18] that because i'll keep going over and in
[29:20] the lord
[29:21] some of these i have deleted off of here
[29:23] as i continue on but some of these i
[29:26] can't just can't delete them
[29:27] so maybe somebody still needs them maybe
[29:29] it's me maybe i'm not explaining it
[29:31] right i always try to blame myself that
[29:33] i'm not explaining it right
[29:35] everybody with me
[29:37] if y'all get any louder we're gonna be
[29:39] in trouble
[29:42] he said he'd give you a new spirit now
[29:44] that spirit isn't god's spirit does
[29:46] everybody understand i want you to go
[29:47] back in your
[29:49] your walk go back into your
[29:53] whatever you want your journey
[29:56] and i want you to know that that you
[29:58] remember when something started changing
[30:03] when that old nature was like man
[30:06] that stinks
[30:08] i don't want nothing to do with that no
[30:10] more
[30:11] i mean you get tired sick and tired of
[30:13] being sick and tired
[30:14] and you want to want a new spirit look
[30:16] brother brown said that's your spirit
[30:18] though that's yourself talking to you
[30:21] understand that
[30:23] but what had happened is god's right
[30:25] there close
[30:27] he's right there close with you and he's
[30:29] leading you and guiding you into the
[30:31] truth because why did the unclean spirit
[30:33] leave
[30:35] because there was a new spirit
[30:37] that was not familiar
[30:39] with that old spirit
[30:42] so it went out
[30:44] that's your spirit god gives you a new
[30:46] spirit then he says i'll put my spirit
[30:48] in him that's when he puts the holy
[30:50] ghost in and then seals you in
[30:53] but the thing god has to do is give you
[30:54] a new spirit make your nature a little
[30:56] more gentle and settle down or he
[30:58] couldn't even
[30:59] live with you
[31:04] now the baptism of my holy ghost seeing
[31:06] you have purified your souls now look
[31:09] so that will probably mean if it says
[31:11] seeing you have purified your souls
[31:14] that it wasn't pure at one time
[31:16] can we just surmise that or can we make
[31:18] the assumption i know you're not
[31:19] supposed to assume but i'm reading it by
[31:22] plain english seeing you have purified
[31:24] your souls
[31:25] why would you purify it if it was
[31:27] already pure
[31:28] no it was lost
[31:30] the you was black the u was lost the u
[31:33] was smutty
[31:34] dark cloudy full of sin
[31:38] god nowhere to be found
[31:42] seeing you have purified your souls what
[31:43] and obeying what the truth
[31:47] obeying the truth of god through the
[31:49] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[31:51] brethren see that you love one another
[31:53] with a pure heart
[31:55] fervently
[31:56] we get into
[31:58] brotherly kindness like brother brown
[31:59] said is going to knock some of us off
[32:02] brother brown said i don't care if you
[32:03] scratch my back i'm going to scratch
[32:04] yours anyway
[32:06] i don't care if you scratch mine it
[32:07] doesn't depend on you scratching mine
[32:09] back
[32:10] a lot of us have a problem with that
[32:12] and it's wrong it's iniquities and that
[32:15] you know to do better we know as as
[32:16] human beings as brothers and sisters in
[32:18] christ we know if we're doing something
[32:21] wrong and we do it anyway it's iniquity
[32:23] that's why the bible says iniquity shall
[32:24] abound oh that's for the world not for
[32:26] us
[32:29] i'm not worried about the world the
[32:31] world is not in iniquity they're in sin
[32:34] iniquity is knowing to do better and not
[32:36] doing it
[32:38] or know not to do it and you do it
[32:40] anyway
[32:41] that's we're all guilty of that
[32:43] but being born again not of corruptible
[32:45] seed but of incorruptible by the word of
[32:46] god which liveth and abideth
[32:49] forever then we were looking at the
[32:51] tabernacle
[32:52] we see the ark of the covenant we'll
[32:54] look at that in just a minute
[32:56] that's the most holy place which is the
[32:58] holy of holies and then that middle part
[33:00] right here is the holy place remember
[33:03] that's where the unclean spirit goes out
[33:05] in your sanctification that is
[33:07] sanctification so there's a candlestick
[33:09] there's an altar of incense there's a
[33:11] table of shoebread eating the word of
[33:12] god you got the candlestick which you've
[33:14] got who's standing in the midst of the
[33:16] seven golden candlesticks
[33:18] like unto the son of man
[33:20] the bride speaking of the bride heading
[33:22] into this part right here and then
[33:24] continuing on into the holy of holies
[33:26] everybody with me what a glorious thing
[33:29] but now all this out here on the outside
[33:31] though look the lava the altar of
[33:32] sacrifice real messy real justification
[33:36] wise uh bad days good days
[33:39] but it's not going to matter when you
[33:41] get back into here
[33:43] where that ark is
[33:44] it's real quiet
[33:46] only you and god that's all
[33:48] you and god that's the only two people
[33:50] in there
[33:51] as you and the lord and then we're gonna
[33:52] talk about that in just a minute
[33:55] so there's our little picture
[33:58] you see how covered that is the holy
[33:59] place in the holy of holies you can't
[34:01] even see it
[34:03] shut in with god in a secret place
[34:09] there in the spirit
[34:11] beholding his face
[34:13] giving you what power
[34:16] to run in this race
[34:18] oh i love
[34:21] to be alone with god
[34:24] that's why our prayer life that's where
[34:26] i miss it and that's where i guess a lot
[34:27] of us all miss it is in our prayer life
[34:29] you know i know we we we pray without
[34:31] ceasing i know i pray all every day for
[34:33] every little thing that comes about i'll
[34:35] say a prayer for
[34:36] but do we really like i want to talk
[34:38] about we're doing you know get into a
[34:39] place and just be shut in with god where
[34:42] nothing is going on except you and god
[34:44] and so you talk to him and let him talk
[34:46] back to you now
[34:49] we're going to look at this in depth a
[34:50] little more i'm like brother louise i
[34:52] can't get out of this so
[34:53] i can't get off of this ark and
[34:56] and uh but there it is there's the ark
[34:58] and we've seen it over here but remember
[35:00] what was the ark the ark was
[35:04] and i'll read it in just a minute it was
[35:05] made i would
[35:08] but it was overlaid with gold
[35:11] everybody with me on this it was
[35:13] overlaid with gold
[35:15] it wasn't completely gold
[35:17] now the seven golden candlesticks were
[35:18] gold
[35:19] beaten gold
[35:21] not the ark
[35:22] the ark was acacia wood
[35:26] with gold laid over it
[35:28] and then we saw that there's what the
[35:30] two tables which is the law
[35:33] everybody with me and the brother brown
[35:35] said to what that the manna was the top
[35:37] of the holy ghost
[35:38] and then that stick that butted is me
[35:40] and you
[35:42] wood speaks of humanity
[35:45] everybody with me and that humanity
[35:47] though once put in where the word is at
[35:49] come on somebody
[35:51] it put in there where the word is at
[35:53] guess what happens it changes
[35:56] a life comes in there whether it was
[35:58] dead there's life now
[36:00] and not just life it actually
[36:03] i just caught this it identifies who it
[36:05] is
[36:08] almonds
[36:09] i'm an almond tree why because i produce
[36:12] almonds i'm a christian because i
[36:14] produce these virtues i'm a christian
[36:16] because these things happen in my life
[36:18] but if you look at that stick now if you
[36:20] look at that stick it just like a stick
[36:22] could be an apple orange pear but once
[36:24] it starts burying fruit
[36:26] once something goes out on the end and
[36:28] you know what happens
[36:30] when you take something like one
[36:33] let me pick one okra
[36:35] you take okra
[36:37] the the power of okra
[36:39] the whole idea is to get the power
[36:42] brother john into that fruit
[36:45] because that's where the seed is that's
[36:47] where the procreation is going to happen
[36:49] because if it don't put a seed out
[36:51] and that seed falls in the ground it's
[36:54] not going to bring forth again so the
[36:55] power so what i do with my okra plants i
[36:57] was reading online and they and it
[37:00] really it works because you see my okra
[37:01] plants they're really high and the
[37:03] fruits up here like this why i cut all
[37:06] the suckers off i cut all the all the
[37:08] unnecessary pieces come on somebody
[37:11] cut the unnecessary god comes in the
[37:14] into your garden and cut your
[37:15] unnecessary pieces off amen
[37:19] tear some of us limb to limb
[37:21] that's good enough for me but remember
[37:23] what that does danny that takes the
[37:25] power in the roots and it pushes it
[37:28] because if it pushes it out here and
[37:29] there's like 20 different limbs or or
[37:31] leaves and you know okra's got great big
[37:33] leaves there's a lot of power goes into
[37:35] that which is nothing right
[37:38] sure it sure it sustains the plant
[37:41] but that that power's got to get in the
[37:43] fruit
[37:44] and i can produce more okra that way by
[37:46] trimming it up same way with a couple of
[37:48] different things tomatoes are the same
[37:50] way cut the suckers off we cut the
[37:51] suckers off of corn
[37:53] because it sucks the life that's why
[37:54] they call them suckers
[37:56] we've had a bunch of suckers stuck to us
[37:59] amen
[38:00] sucking the life out of us
[38:03] hello somebody whatever sucker you want
[38:05] to call it it's a sucker
[38:08] suck the life right out of you and satan
[38:10] is a master sucker
[38:16] but there you've got the ark of the
[38:17] covenant which we know that that types
[38:19] jesus christ
[38:20] because there's the law
[38:23] there's the holy ghost which is the
[38:25] manna
[38:26] which god produced
[38:27] then that's a rod that god planted
[38:29] somewhere down the line a long time ago
[38:31] and it grew up and they cut the thing
[38:33] off and it became dead
[38:36] we explained that last time it became
[38:38] dead
[38:39] somewhere along the line it was alive in
[38:42] the garden of eden but it became dead
[38:44] but it took god
[38:46] what a supernatural event when they put
[38:48] that rod in there and that thing started
[38:50] budding and not only budding not only
[38:52] leaving leafing
[38:54] it put fruit out
[38:56] so all that energy
[38:58] it's not connected to anything so it was
[39:00] the energy of god
[39:02] so now look
[39:06] let me see if i can get that moved over
[39:07] a little bit
[39:08] tada
[39:09] so the ark is a symbol of the son of man
[39:12] who is the son of man jesus christ
[39:14] he's the law he's the prophet he's the
[39:16] word of god he's the holy ghost and he's
[39:19] human
[39:20] oh
[39:21] what
[39:22] yeah how many times have we told you the
[39:24] son of god is not a human being
[39:26] in that we are human beings
[39:29] the son of god is a spirit
[39:32] theophany
[39:33] but the son of man is flesh so i keep
[39:36] reading john 1 1 14. because brother
[39:38] brown said who is this son of man he
[39:40] said in the beginning was the word where
[39:42] was god in the word was god and the word
[39:43] was made flesh
[39:45] and dwelt among us so watch this right
[39:46] here brother i'm on the ark
[39:49] jeffersonville 1955. now watch the ark
[39:51] of the covenant he said you shall make
[39:52] it out of acacia wood and overlay it
[39:55] with gold
[39:56] anyone who knows the scripture knows
[39:58] that gold speaks of deity and wood
[40:01] speaks of humanity
[40:03] so watch how perfect this thing is you
[40:06] could have made it out of pure gold but
[40:08] it wouldn't fit the scripture it
[40:09] wouldn't affect jesus christ
[40:12] because you've got to have humanity
[40:14] but there's a but there's something
[40:17] that's holding back the judgment what's
[40:19] this
[40:20] the word speaks of humanity
[40:22] see he said you shall cover it overlay
[40:25] it with gold
[40:26] over the wood
[40:29] that's wood that's me and you he's going
[40:32] to overlay it look that's deity
[40:34] over the wood
[40:36] what does wood speak of humanity our
[40:39] frailty our humanity
[40:41] but you overlap with deity look christ
[40:44] over the church
[40:48] i guess y'all just not getting it like i
[40:49] got it
[40:51] deity over the wood
[40:54] christ over the church inside and out
[40:57] deity overlaid
[41:00] you'll have a lid on top of it it'll be
[41:02] a mercy seat and all the look all the
[41:04] laws will rest in it now what is the law
[41:07] the law was a schoolmaster to bring us
[41:09] to christ but the law was do's and
[41:10] don'ts in the old testament how about
[41:12] with me right it actually brother brown
[41:15] said put you in jail
[41:17] it actually give you no way out right
[41:22] you were dead under the law
[41:24] brother the bible says dead ain't
[41:26] trespassing sin
[41:27] everybody with me and all the laws will
[41:30] rest in it but before you you sprinkle
[41:32] it with blood what sprinkle it with
[41:34] blood over the mercy seat is brother
[41:36] louise the mercy seat's on top the ark's
[41:38] at the bottom the mercy seats on top
[41:40] with the two cherubims
[41:42] the law speaks of judgment watch this
[41:44] but between the law and the congregation
[41:50] between that law that was inside the ten
[41:52] commandments
[41:54] and the people outside
[41:57] there was gold
[42:00] deity had to stand in your place
[42:03] there had to be a buffer
[42:05] the congregation there was something for
[42:07] deity stood in its place top of christ
[42:11] between the wrath of god the judgment in
[42:14] hell between that and the believer
[42:16] stands deity himself christ
[42:19] standing in the way with an atonement
[42:22] blood
[42:24] to save us from our sins and to heal us
[42:26] from our sickness deity stands in the
[42:28] way between judgment
[42:30] that's what that art stood for
[42:32] it wasn't just a piece of something it
[42:34] wasn't just and yeah it was in the holy
[42:36] of holies but it had a it had a plan and
[42:38] a purpose
[42:40] it was deity standing in our place we
[42:44] were caught inside of that box
[42:47] we were caught inside of the box folks i
[42:49] don't want to hit my still got my
[42:52] i still got my heart monitor on and i
[42:54] still have a heart because look that
[42:55] little thing's beeping
[42:58] i gotta wear it for another week
[43:00] but all is well
[43:02] but deity stands in the way between
[43:04] judgment listen if you were to pull
[43:05] those two tables of stone up
[43:08] we'd all be dead
[43:10] if we had to go by the ten commandments
[43:13] thou shalt not thou shalt not hello
[43:15] somebody
[43:16] but deity the gold stood in the way
[43:20] listen
[43:21] we're gonna see it just a minute
[43:23] a beautiful picture
[43:26] of deity
[43:28] over laying wood
[43:31] on a cross
[43:35] he stood between the wood
[43:37] and the people
[43:39] and they hung him on a tree
[43:41] they hung deity
[43:43] on a tree
[43:45] there you are your daily walk your daily
[43:47] talk so here we go we're going to start
[43:49] in this part that i'm trying to get to
[43:51] there you are your daily walk your daily
[43:54] talk your daily behavior so what we're
[43:56] going to do when we go through this
[43:57] statue of perfect man we're going to
[43:59] talk about just our daily life
[44:02] amen the things that we do where do you
[44:04] have your trouble when you're at church
[44:05] not so much when you're asleep not so
[44:07] much your daily life
[44:10] you're waking hours
[44:13] and don't try and some of y'all may try
[44:14] to sleep it off but you can't do that
[44:18] get up the crack of noon
[44:22] your daily behavior your heart your soul
[44:24] and all is holy holy holy to the lord
[44:27] no roots of bitterness
[44:33] no roots
[44:35] of bitterness
[44:37] brother brown said that's what will kill
[44:39] a church
[44:40] it's a root of bitterness
[44:46] holy holy holy and to the lord as we
[44:48] begin to approach in behalf of our
[44:50] brother whosoever will may come anointed
[44:52] blood in front of him the blood going
[44:54] remember
[44:55] the priest had to hold the blood in
[44:57] front of him
[44:58] and he sprinkled the mercy seat with the
[45:01] blood
[45:02] holy holy holy into the lord now that
[45:03] was the outer court the holy place and
[45:06] the holy of holies that was god's
[45:07] sanctuary
[45:09] on earth and we talked about fruits the
[45:11] other day we'll skip through that pretty
[45:12] quick because why did moses put the rods
[45:14] in the
[45:15] in the ark in the first place we
[45:17] understand why because why there was
[45:19] people murmuring complaining there was
[45:20] deacons wanting to be preachers there
[45:21] was preachers wanting to be evangelists
[45:23] there was amanda's wanting to be pastor
[45:30] if people had a better idea
[45:32] than the pastor's god
[45:34] or then the deacon's god or then the
[45:36] elders have
[45:38] yeah
[45:39] that's what it was they were bickering
[45:41] they were bickering the congregation was
[45:43] bickering amongst each other
[45:45] and god said i'll shut you up
[45:47] listen if moses would have went in there
[45:50] and and did some you know something and
[45:52] come out and say well no it had to be
[45:54] god because he knew there was 12 dead
[45:56] sticks went into that ark
[45:59] 12 dead sticks because each one from
[46:02] each tribe handed it to moses
[46:04] even aaron
[46:06] from levi handed it to moses he took all
[46:09] 12 took him in there laid him down in
[46:11] front of the ark next day he walked in
[46:13] there not a one but one
[46:16] 11 were still dead
[46:19] but one
[46:20] the tribe of levi
[46:23] the preachers
[46:25] now that doesn't mean the preachers
[46:26] don't want to bear fruit but the
[46:27] preacher ought to bear fruit first
[46:30] i'm sorry the preacher ought to bear
[46:31] fruit first
[46:33] like peter now how would it be if peter
[46:34] was going now y'all need to act like me
[46:37] before calvary
[46:41] let's cut some ears off let's let's
[46:43] start let's start cussing at people
[46:47] hello that's the way peter was before he
[46:48] got born again
[46:50] but once he got born again let's go to
[46:52] ii peter where he says add
[46:54] to your faith a virtue
[46:56] your virtue knowledge your knowledge
[46:58] temperance patience brotherly kindness
[47:01] and love
[47:03] it took a man that had what protected
[47:05] the first fruits
[47:07] moses laid up the rod before the lord
[47:09] and the tabernacle witness it came to
[47:10] pass it on tomorrow moses went into
[47:12] tabernacle and behold
[47:14] see even the people knew
[47:18] that nobody went into that holy of
[47:20] holies except either the high priest
[47:22] or moses and if aaron stayed out
[47:26] which he had to because he handed him
[47:28] the rod moses took the thing back there
[47:30] the prophet went in and laid it down
[47:33] so then we've got to look at a
[47:35] vindicated prophet
[47:37] and what and know that he went in first
[47:41] he went in and got it first from god
[47:44] spoke lip to ear and he turns around and
[47:46] says aaron's rod
[47:48] it's butted
[47:50] and brought almonds so i want everybody
[47:52] to get in their place
[47:54] nathan cora
[47:57] they wanted to have their own deal
[47:59] they wanted to make their own
[48:01] kingdom for their self right bob
[48:04] make they have their own kingdom back
[48:05] there
[48:07] but you know what god shut them up
[48:09] the word always comes out first
[48:12] so the god said okay i'm going to bloom
[48:14] this thing and i'm going to give them
[48:15] some almonds to look at not just blooms
[48:17] because you know you might think well
[48:19] there's still enough life left in there
[48:20] but just like i said before the energy
[48:23] to produce fruit is twice what it is to
[48:26] produce anything else
[48:28] because fruit is the energy of the plant
[48:31] so it's got to go up through that stalk
[48:33] and out into the sure it's got to go
[48:35] through the leaves but that's where the
[48:36] photosynthesis is that's where it
[48:38] gathers it's light but that root is the
[48:40] your when you you don't put your
[48:42] fertilizer on you now unless you get
[48:44] liquid but you normally don't put
[48:45] fertilizer on your leaves where do you
[48:48] put it put in the ground
[48:50] so what so the water can dissolve it
[48:52] and the what the roots can suck it up
[48:55] through the stalk
[48:57] out into the what the almond tree or
[48:59] whatever you wanna
[49:00] your tree
[49:02] washing
[49:04] of the water
[49:05] by the word of god
[49:07] all right moses brought them all out and
[49:09] the lord said unto moses bring aaron's
[49:10] rod
[49:12] because i'm going to keep it for a token
[49:14] against these rebels
[49:16] read it
[49:17] and thou shalt quite take away their
[49:19] murmuring from me
[49:21] that they die not let's not die
[49:23] spiritually by murmuring and complaining
[49:25] amen let's try not to do that
[49:28] jesus said the hours come that the son
[49:30] of man should be glorified verily verily
[49:31] i say unto you except the corn of wheat
[49:33] fall
[49:34] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[49:37] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[49:39] fruit see that's kind of strange but
[49:41] jesus is looking right back at the
[49:42] tabernacle he's going hey i made aaron's
[49:45] ride bud
[49:47] i made aaron's rod bring forth fruit out
[49:49] of a dead stick
[49:51] but if it die it brings forth
[49:54] much fruit everybody with me
[49:57] jesus said in matthew 15 but he answered
[49:58] and said every plant which my heavenly
[50:01] father hath not planted
[50:04] shall be rooted up
[50:06] romans 6 4 therefore we are buried with
[50:09] him by baptism into death that like as
[50:11] christ was raised from the dead by the
[50:13] glory of the father even so we also
[50:15] should walk in newness of life for if we
[50:17] have been planted together
[50:19] in the likeness of his death
[50:22] we shall also be in the likeness of his
[50:25] resurrection
[50:26] knowing this that what our old man is
[50:28] crucified with him look we were
[50:30] crucified with him it's what we're
[50:32] getting into what i'm going to talk
[50:33] about in a minute we were crucified with
[50:35] him we were not on that cross but we
[50:37] were on that cross inside of him
[50:40] like i was telling you right when
[50:42] brother william was here
[50:43] that struck me the other day
[50:46] you know it kind of
[50:48] and i'm not trying to play god but but
[50:50] if if you try to portray god as this all
[50:52] all-knowing all-seeing
[50:55] totally infinite no no day when he does
[50:57] just what i did i went uh what's my next
[50:59] thought
[51:00] right
[51:01] he don't have those
[51:03] he's just an all-eternal all-speaking
[51:05] all never had a never had a a pain or an
[51:08] ache
[51:09] i was sitting the other day and this
[51:11] thing went off and said it was
[51:12] disconnected and i thought well
[51:15] am i breathing
[51:17] have i done passed over well i stood up
[51:18] my knees started hurting my back started
[51:20] hurting in my and my shoulder started
[51:22] hurting i said nope i'm still here
[51:26] but god didn't have a day in his life
[51:29] did he hurt
[51:32] until he became in flesh
[51:35] so there to me is a struggle
[51:39] because jesus when he when god was put
[51:41] into humanity
[51:43] father let this cup
[51:45] pass from me
[51:47] but nevertheless not my will but thy
[51:49] will be done
[51:51] god had to change his form
[51:53] not only change his form he locked
[51:55] himself into
[51:58] that ark
[51:59] he locked himself into humanity
[52:02] he had to come wood
[52:05] but deity
[52:07] we just couldn't see it
[52:09] but that's what came
[52:12] he came to his own
[52:13] and his own received him not
[52:16] but once once once brother donnie he
[52:18] made the decision before the foundation
[52:20] of the world in eternity he made a
[52:22] decision to go through that womb and to
[52:24] become a human being and have to breathe
[52:26] like me and you
[52:28] now there's some miraculous things that
[52:29] he did but there's not a recording that
[52:31] he walked through the ocean no he walked
[52:34] on top
[52:35] because he was a human he wasn't a fish
[52:36] he was a human
[52:39] but it was miraculous that he walked on
[52:40] it because he changed the elements but
[52:42] still
[52:43] there was times when look there was
[52:45] times when he had to sleep
[52:49] sleep so hard that the boat was about to
[52:51] capsize and his pearl disciples they got
[52:53] mad at him
[52:56] you sleeping when we're dying
[52:58] and he's over going
[53:01] that was his humanity
[53:04] but when he woke up
[53:08] when we wake up
[53:11] put your foot on the boat
[53:14] somebody's gonna have to wake you up
[53:16] physically and spiritually
[53:20] knowing this that our old man is what
[53:22] crucified with him when he went to the
[53:24] cross there was no way to get me and you
[53:27] out once he became a baby once he became
[53:30] emmanuel god with us god wrapped in
[53:32] human flesh once he became that there
[53:34] was no way for him to come out
[53:38] until he died
[53:39] until he died
[53:41] melchizedek was different remember
[53:42] melchizedek created a full-grown body
[53:46] stepped into that body
[53:49] and
[53:50] met abraham right
[53:52] but that wasn't our savior now inside of
[53:54] there was the savior but he didn't come
[53:56] the way we came so he we couldn't be
[53:58] heirs and join airs with melchizedek
[54:03] there was no there was no there was a
[54:05] humanity there but he wasn't locked in
[54:06] what did he do brother brown said he
[54:08] just stepped out
[54:09] and as aaron always says those 16
[54:11] elements just fell to the ground
[54:13] went right back into the earth but now
[54:14] when he came into human flesh there was
[54:17] no way that he could pull himself out
[54:20] and be somewhere else be something else
[54:23] he was deity
[54:25] he was wood
[54:27] wrapped in deity
[54:31] gold
[54:32] frankincense
[54:34] and myrrh deity
[54:35] dedicated
[54:37] to be a dead stick
[54:39] knowing this that our old man is
[54:41] crucified with him that the body of sin
[54:43] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[54:45] should not serve sin
[54:46] for he that is dead
[54:50] is free from sin
[54:52] everybody with me
[54:54] the prophet of god said the power
[54:56] decision
[54:57] he said put aaron's rod in there an old
[54:59] dead almond tree but as it went under
[55:01] the shekinah glory
[55:03] everything it was was restored again
[55:05] that's the way a sinner is when he goes
[55:07] under the shekinah glory of the holy
[55:08] spirit the veil drops behind him
[55:11] everything that he ought to have been a
[55:12] son of god what blooms out in him again
[55:17] amen
[55:18] listen before the foundation of the
[55:20] world
[55:22] there's uh
[55:23] some of the brothers sent me a clip of a
[55:25] brother preaching and they all still
[55:27] going back to the all the seeds were
[55:28] laying in the ground
[55:31] when the earth was
[55:32] made well now you got to take the quote
[55:35] where brother brown said that seed was
[55:36] placing you before the foundation of
[55:38] that
[55:41] before the foundation of that is when it
[55:43] was placed in you now go back to the
[55:45] scripture go back to what brother brown
[55:46] said they asked him a question brother
[55:47] brown what were we before we were born
[55:49] he said you were nothing right
[55:51] only in the mind of god
[55:54] were you anything
[55:57] there's to see the word was already
[55:59] there the word for you to blossom in
[56:01] bloom
[56:04] but you were born a dead stick
[56:07] no way out
[56:10] everything he ought to have been a son
[56:12] of god blooms out in him again amen
[56:14] remember overnight it budded blossomed
[56:17] and grown almonds on it fruits of the
[56:18] spirit
[56:19] love joy long suffering goodness
[56:21] gentleness patience that's what we need
[56:23] to get in the third step get over into
[56:24] the shekinah glory talk about going to
[56:26] the second bale where that little sacred
[56:29] light was hanging over the mercy seat
[56:31] prophet of god said oh why is my people
[56:33] so tossed about
[56:35] they took aaron's rod and laid aaron's
[56:37] rod in the presence of this holy place
[56:39] and when they did in one night's time it
[56:41] butted blossomed and yielded almonds in
[56:44] one night's time think of it in the
[56:46] presence of god
[56:47] this old dead rod lying there in the
[56:50] presence of god butted blossomed and
[56:51] yielded almonds in one night what was it
[56:54] then what kind of a rod was it it was an
[56:57] almond tree rod that's what he'd taken
[56:59] it from the stick was off of an almond
[57:01] tree and you are a stick some kind
[57:05] and you were taken off the branch of
[57:07] humanity
[57:08] which was god's created son in the
[57:10] beginning
[57:12] which was god's creative son in the
[57:14] beginning you may be fallen
[57:16] dead alienated from god but by that in
[57:19] creation you were created to be a son of
[57:22] god you may bounce around be respected
[57:24] and honored out here in the courts he's
[57:26] talking about the outer outer court but
[57:29] if you ever get into that glorious place
[57:31] and hide away with god you'll yield what
[57:33] you're supposed to do
[57:35] that's what i want us to do let it out
[57:37] yield what you're supposed to yield be
[57:39] whatever you're supposed to be
[57:41] let that thing out
[57:44] what a beautiful picture it is today of
[57:45] a consecrated life who once enters into
[57:47] the with christ
[57:49] dead to the things of the world hid away
[57:51] with god and the veil dropped down
[57:53] around and all the world shut off then
[57:55] christianity and religion becomes a
[57:57] pleasure
[58:00] a pleasure
[58:02] to every believer
[58:05] why are we so tossed about watches right
[58:07] here
[58:08] today people just have enough religion
[58:11] to make them miserable
[58:16] wow
[58:18] knowing that they ought to do this
[58:20] they're trying to escape hell well if
[58:22] that's the way i felt about it brother i
[58:24] don't know what i would do
[58:28] oh get in with christ shut off from the
[58:30] things of the world commune with him and
[58:32] to commune with him as well it's a
[58:33] pleasure
[58:34] it's beautiful
[58:36] it's something that fills and satisfies
[58:38] the soul something that gives you peace
[58:40] that passes all understanding all the
[58:42] crosses become flying wings
[58:45] all the burdens are chariot wheels oh
[58:47] you can fly away now he can let that
[58:49] spirit grow
[58:51] and take out all the roots of bitterness
[58:53] and press god's way look press
[58:56] god's way through him again and he can
[58:58] become back in the same condition
[59:01] right
[59:02] same condition
[59:04] that he was in the garden of eden
[59:08] talk about this mountain be moved statue
[59:09] of a perfect man
[59:11] if you die you take the blood out of a
[59:13] man you're embalming trouble of it is a
[59:14] lot of them never got embalmed
[59:17] you take the blood out of a man he's
[59:19] gone then the only thing you can do is
[59:21] put another blood back in him he's going
[59:23] to live again you took his blood out
[59:26] and now we put the blood of jesus christ
[59:28] in sea and that brings the faith of
[59:30] jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ
[59:32] the knowledge of jesus christ the
[59:33] temperance of jesus christ the patience
[59:35] of jesus christ the godliness of jesus
[59:37] christ the brotherly kindness of jesus
[59:39] christ and the love of god which is
[59:41] jesus christ
[59:42] everybody with me
[59:44] he's the head and controls you and your
[59:46] feet is the foundation
[59:48] faith a man controlled by the head
[59:51] takes the that's why the headstone had
[59:53] to come back in the end time to fully
[59:56] control his bride
[59:58] he only controlled what the word was
[1:00:00] laid out for each age amen
[1:00:03] but not the fullness we now have the
[1:00:04] fullness of the word but with that comes
[1:00:07] responsibility
[1:00:10] with that comes responsibility to not
[1:00:12] just say i want to be born again because
[1:00:14] we're going to get into just a minute
[1:00:16] we're going to see about this
[1:00:18] cross that we've been talking about
[1:00:20] there you are there's the perfect man of
[1:00:22] god when he possesses
[1:00:24] these
[1:00:25] virtues now once you look at this this
[1:00:27] was the chart that we had when we first
[1:00:29] started
[1:00:30] justification
[1:00:31] sanctification
[1:00:33] and the baptism of the holy ghost brings
[1:00:35] you to what brings you to the new birth
[1:00:38] are not
[1:00:40] you bring to the faith of god and then
[1:00:42] when he gives it to you it's your faith
[1:00:45] amen bible says add to your faith
[1:00:47] so there's a transfer of that power
[1:00:50] jesus when he stood he said go to
[1:00:52] jerusalem where you'll be endured listen
[1:00:54] i give you power i've given you a
[1:00:57] temporary power to cast out devils and
[1:00:59] do all these different things but the
[1:01:00] devil got involved
[1:01:03] judas was there the whole time
[1:01:06] but now i'm going to bring you into a
[1:01:07] place where judas is not going to be
[1:01:09] able to cop
[1:01:10] i'm going to get you into the upper room
[1:01:12] and i'm going to give you my power and
[1:01:14] when i give you my power it's going to
[1:01:15] become your power
[1:01:19] so
[1:01:21] if you move that 1 2 and three over to
[1:01:23] the middle and we can't because it says
[1:01:25] faith what does that look like
[1:01:29] a what
[1:01:31] a cross
[1:01:33] looks like a cross right
[1:01:35] because i want you to look at something
[1:01:39] we'll read it in just a few minutes i
[1:01:40] got it out i knew about it
[1:01:43] because it's the only way jesus could
[1:01:44] have carried his cross
[1:01:46] you can't carry a three or four hundred
[1:01:47] pound cross
[1:01:48] that wood was almost 400 pounds
[1:01:51] it was the top beam is what he carried
[1:01:55] doesn't that kind of look like a
[1:01:58] beam
[1:02:00] let's talk about just a minute is
[1:02:01] everybody all right
[1:02:02] wake up for a minute
[1:02:04] all right now this is the total of
[1:02:06] everything that we've been talking about
[1:02:08] so we see that we haven't even got to
[1:02:10] the son of man so we're now the virtues
[1:02:13] are the son of god revelation but each
[1:02:15] one of those to me if you'll visualize
[1:02:18] each one of those brother joe looks like
[1:02:20] a bar
[1:02:22] faith
[1:02:23] virtue
[1:02:24] knowledge
[1:02:25] temperance looks like a bar if you pull
[1:02:27] them all apart just like i did before
[1:02:29] there's a bar there
[1:02:31] and it's a bar that you got a bear
[1:02:34] cause that's the top beam of your cross
[1:02:37] everybody with me
[1:02:40] now
[1:02:41] there's three kinds of crosses
[1:02:43] there's three kind of things that you
[1:02:44] can do with the cross
[1:02:45] you can be the enemies of the cross
[1:02:48] you can get to the cross
[1:02:50] and then you can carry a cross
[1:02:52] but now remember there was only one
[1:02:54] cross
[1:02:55] that jesus died on
[1:02:57] the bible said he died once for all so
[1:02:59] there's not several different crosses
[1:03:01] everybody with me for salvation there's
[1:03:04] only one cross
[1:03:06] then there are some that never come to
[1:03:08] that there are the enemies of the cross
[1:03:12] then there are some that get to the
[1:03:13] cross but don't get any further
[1:03:18] then there's some that takes that beam
[1:03:24] and carries it
[1:03:30] and the cross was made out of wood
[1:03:34] it was overlaid with deity
[1:03:37] when he hung there on that cross that
[1:03:39] was what would humanity his humanity but
[1:03:42] he took that judgment
[1:03:45] he was the gold
[1:03:47] that stood between me my humanity
[1:03:50] and the people he stood
[1:03:53] and took my sin so that way we don't
[1:03:55] have to have a cross for sin and shame
[1:03:59] anymore we have one remember brother
[1:04:01] brown said a lot of people can't get him
[1:04:03] off the cross that's why the catholic
[1:04:05] church has crucifixes which is jesus on
[1:04:08] the cross
[1:04:09] that's a crucifix that means they can't
[1:04:11] get him off the cross we as christians
[1:04:13] we don't carry
[1:04:14] we carry empty crosses
[1:04:17] is your cross still got jesus on it
[1:04:18] better not because he didn't go to
[1:04:20] pentecost if he didn't get off that crop
[1:04:22] hello somebody come on
[1:04:25] you say that's silly it's not silly it's
[1:04:27] exactly what it is brother brown said
[1:04:29] some people can't get him off the cross
[1:04:32] and a lot of people get to the cross and
[1:04:34] say oh 2 000 years ago he he did this
[1:04:38] for me
[1:04:39] that's all right it's a story you're
[1:04:41] right it's a good story makes you cry
[1:04:43] and weep because you know you look at
[1:04:44] the passion of the christ you watch the
[1:04:46] movie
[1:04:49] sorry folks it was all staged in that
[1:04:51] movie
[1:04:52] i told you what ruined it for me was you
[1:04:53] watched that movie for some time and and
[1:04:56] then you know you got
[1:04:57] they did all the
[1:04:59] sliced him up and diced him up and put
[1:05:01] the crown on his head and had blood
[1:05:03] everywhere
[1:05:04] and i saw behind the scenes part of the
[1:05:06] movie and you could see him sitting
[1:05:07] there eating chicken
[1:05:09] looked just like jesus hanging on the
[1:05:10] cross but he wasn't he was an actor and
[1:05:12] he was hungry he was eating chicken just
[1:05:14] like me and you so that kind of took
[1:05:15] away the
[1:05:16] from the uh
[1:05:18] the the the part that that's supposed to
[1:05:20] be real
[1:05:21] and they made it look real but that was
[1:05:23] a real man did that
[1:05:25] his name was jesus christ deity
[1:05:27] hung on humanity
[1:05:30] for me and you so no we don't have to go
[1:05:32] that's why we don't have to put him back
[1:05:34] on the cross that's why brother brown
[1:05:36] says i indict this generation for the
[1:05:39] second crucifixion they put him back on
[1:05:41] the cross
[1:05:44] amen
[1:05:47] because of their creeds they put him
[1:05:48] back on a cross they couldn't get him
[1:05:51] off the cross and get him into the
[1:05:53] people
[1:05:55] so there's enemies of the cross
[1:05:57] there's people that get to the cross
[1:06:00] and then there's people that carry your
[1:06:02] cross
[1:06:03] everybody with me so the cross was made
[1:06:04] out of wood overlaid with deity he hung
[1:06:07] there and listen folks i'm going to read
[1:06:09] you exactly what the crucifixion process
[1:06:12] is
[1:06:13] everybody with me
[1:06:14] all right stay awake i hope i'm not born
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:17] the process based on roman literature as
[1:06:19] well as descriptions in the provinces
[1:06:21] crucifixion was an established routine
[1:06:24] there were several military teams led by
[1:06:27] centurion remember the centurion was
[1:06:28] there
[1:06:29] and in the provinces the soldiers were
[1:06:31] selected from the local auxiliaries
[1:06:34] natives who had joined the roman army
[1:06:36] the victim was stripped and lashed or
[1:06:38] scourged the bible talks about scourging
[1:06:40] jesus
[1:06:41] as part of the public humility and i
[1:06:43] want to stop right here because i didn't
[1:06:45] get the
[1:06:46] i didn't get the full
[1:06:48] um it was another quote
[1:06:52] but you know they didn't they didn't
[1:06:53] they didn't put murders on cross
[1:06:57] what'd they do with barabbas
[1:06:59] he'd let him go
[1:07:01] do you know who got put on crosses
[1:07:04] political dissidents
[1:07:06] and religious idiots are religious
[1:07:09] fanatics
[1:07:10] because they wanted to hang them on a
[1:07:12] cross for public humility so that
[1:07:14] they'll uprise listen if you if i went
[1:07:16] murder brother boyd back in the in that
[1:07:18] time if i wouldn't murder him i was just
[1:07:19] a murderer
[1:07:20] that didn't that didn't incite a riot
[1:07:23] that didn't incite a crowd
[1:07:25] but you let a political dissident stand
[1:07:28] up and say this government's wrong
[1:07:30] and you start getting followers or you
[1:07:32] get this like jesus
[1:07:35] raise it you know destroy this temple i
[1:07:37] raise it up in three days
[1:07:39] that's who they hung on crosses as a
[1:07:42] public humiliation
[1:07:44] listen that's why you and i
[1:07:46] if when we pick up our cross yeah we're
[1:07:49] going to be humiliated publicly your
[1:07:51] sisters are going to wear your long hair
[1:07:53] your brothers are not going to act like
[1:07:54] the world
[1:07:58] a part of the public humiliation he or
[1:08:00] she was led through the streets and
[1:08:01] remain naked you know that for a fact
[1:08:04] when jesus was put on the cross folks it
[1:08:05] wasn't he didn't have a loincloth on
[1:08:07] that was put there for uh we'll read it
[1:08:09] right here
[1:08:10] christian art portrays jesus with a
[1:08:12] decent loin cloth on the cross but the
[1:08:14] nakedness was maintained as part of the
[1:08:16] humiliation
[1:08:18] there was a public plaque titleist
[1:08:21] indicating the crime the shedding of
[1:08:23] blood and the context concept of corpse
[1:08:26] contamination meaning that the execution
[1:08:28] took place outside the city walls
[1:08:31] because of contamination everybody with
[1:08:33] me the most popular spot was along one
[1:08:36] of the main roads leading into the city
[1:08:38] this also served as propaganda purposes
[1:08:41] to demonstrate roman law and order the
[1:08:43] victim did not carry the whole cross
[1:08:46] only the cross beam
[1:08:50] everybody with me amen
[1:08:54] there's your bean
[1:08:57] because you got a bear
[1:09:00] watch this is the rest of it
[1:09:03] these killing fields contained permanent
[1:09:05] upright poles
[1:09:09] dead sticks
[1:09:11] the victim did not carry the whole cross
[1:09:13] but only the crossbeam the combined pole
[1:09:17] and crossbeam weighed approximately
[1:09:19] 130-180 kilograms which is three to four
[1:09:22] hundred pounds there's no way a human
[1:09:24] man can carry the whole thing
[1:09:26] after scourging the trauma and loss of
[1:09:28] blood there was a risk that the victim
[1:09:31] could die before arriving at the site of
[1:09:33] the execution
[1:09:34] the necessity of keeping the victim of
[1:09:36] light alive led to the practice of the
[1:09:39] legions commandeering someone from the
[1:09:41] crowd to help carry the beam when the
[1:09:43] victim succumbed this is the role simon
[1:09:46] of serene in the gospel remember he
[1:09:48] picks up the cross and carries it for
[1:09:50] jesus all right
[1:09:51] upon arrival the
[1:09:53] the victim was either tied or nailed to
[1:09:55] the crossbeam which was then hoisted up
[1:09:58] which made it worse
[1:10:01] you're hanging
[1:10:02] just by your hands
[1:10:05] until they set you on that upright pole
[1:10:08] and attach you to it it's pulling your
[1:10:10] it's pulling the ligaments of your arms
[1:10:12] i mean it's horrible
[1:10:13] hoisted up and connected to the vertical
[1:10:15] pole with ladders and pulleys we have
[1:10:18] evidence of the use of nails from
[1:10:19] several sources
[1:10:21] they were five to seven inches long
[1:10:23] tapered iron spikes the application of
[1:10:25] the nails varied seneca reported that
[1:10:27] some were hung upside down remember
[1:10:29] peter was hung upside down or with arms
[1:10:32] stretched out on either side josephus
[1:10:33] reported seeing crucifix victims at the
[1:10:36] seas of jerusalem do you remember in 70
[1:10:38] a.d remember god told them said get out
[1:10:39] of jerusalem
[1:10:41] titus
[1:10:42] besieged and they eat their own kids
[1:10:45] they crucified them
[1:10:48] where the soldiers positioned them in
[1:10:49] various poses to amuse themselves out of
[1:10:53] anger and hatred some people collected
[1:10:55] the nails as magical
[1:10:57] amulets you know we know now that the
[1:11:00] catholic church says they have so many
[1:11:01] nails and you know these got so many
[1:11:03] nails and jesus must have 40 or 50 nails
[1:11:05] in him
[1:11:08] that ain't going to make no difference
[1:11:10] none at all so let's read what the bible
[1:11:13] says look in philippians 3 verse 18 for
[1:11:15] many walk a vuma high have told you
[1:11:17] often and now tell you even weeping
[1:11:21] paul's weeping
[1:11:23] because they are the enemies of the
[1:11:24] cross of christ there's people will
[1:11:26] never accept it
[1:11:28] there's people that are what brew beasts
[1:11:30] made for destruction they're never going
[1:11:32] to even get to the cross they deny the
[1:11:33] cross they deny jesus christ they deny
[1:11:35] there's even a god
[1:11:37] so we're not talking about those whose
[1:11:39] end is destruction
[1:11:41] they're not even counted in the
[1:11:43] religious community
[1:11:45] whose end is destruction whose god is
[1:11:47] what their belly
[1:11:50] and that's a metaphor they're not just a
[1:11:52] belly
[1:11:53] what their riches their fame their
[1:11:55] fortune their gut
[1:11:56] their person that's all they care about
[1:11:59] and whose glory is what their shame
[1:12:03] i mean i deliver mail and i'm sorry i'm
[1:12:05] a human being but
[1:12:06] but you got the the biggest magazines
[1:12:10] have the biggest naked women on them
[1:12:14] why do they do that they think it's
[1:12:15] wonderful
[1:12:17] i look at it as shame
[1:12:19] that a woman's putting herself out there
[1:12:21] going to kill billions of other millions
[1:12:23] of other people
[1:12:25] who mind the earthly things
[1:12:27] now look let's go here now remember
[1:12:29] there's enemies of the cross they don't
[1:12:30] even care about what we're talking about
[1:12:31] tonight
[1:12:32] all right
[1:12:34] colossians 2 verse 14 this is paul
[1:12:36] against is blotting out the handwriting
[1:12:38] of ordinances that was against us which
[1:12:41] was contrary to us
[1:12:42] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[1:12:45] his cross now he's talking about mine in
[1:12:47] your sins
[1:12:48] everybody with me he's nailing it to his
[1:12:51] cross
[1:12:52] there was one cross on golgotha and
[1:12:54] that's the only one we need we don't
[1:12:56] need another cross
[1:12:57] like that
[1:13:00] he died once
[1:13:01] for all
[1:13:03] by everybody with me
[1:13:05] but
[1:13:09] for christ sent me not to baptize but to
[1:13:11] preach the gospel
[1:13:13] not with wisdom of words lest what the
[1:13:15] cross of christ should be made of none
[1:13:17] effect
[1:13:19] wow
[1:13:21] look for the preaching of the cross is
[1:13:23] to them that perish foolishly
[1:13:28] what brother brown said you've got to
[1:13:29] crawl over the cross to get to hell
[1:13:31] right
[1:13:32] every person in the world's got to walk
[1:13:34] right by that cross to get to hell
[1:13:37] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:13:39] them that perish foolishly
[1:13:41] i'm going to try to find that quote
[1:13:42] where brother brown says never forget
[1:13:44] calvary
[1:13:45] never forget what happened at the cross
[1:13:47] listen we can be revelated with all
[1:13:48] these seals and vials and plagues of
[1:13:50] daniel 70 weeks but if we forget the
[1:13:52] cross
[1:13:53] you better you better remember how you
[1:13:55] got the knowledge you got
[1:13:59] for the preaching of the cross of them
[1:14:00] that point perish foolishness
[1:14:04] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[1:14:07] it is the power of god
[1:14:11] now let's see if we can live this
[1:14:15] he that loveth father and mother more
[1:14:16] than me is not worthy
[1:14:19] of me
[1:14:22] and he that loveth son or daughter
[1:14:26] more than me
[1:14:28] is not worthy
[1:14:30] of me
[1:14:33] and that's actually even a red letter
[1:14:35] it's jesus talking
[1:14:36] everybody with me
[1:14:38] he that loveth father and mother more
[1:14:40] than
[1:14:40] me you stay out of church because your
[1:14:42] mom and daddy comes to visit you if
[1:14:44] they're not believers
[1:14:48] son and daughter comes in town you take
[1:14:51] a day off of church just to visit with
[1:14:52] your family
[1:14:54] they're watching you like a hawk
[1:14:57] they know that your religion ain't good
[1:14:59] it's just it's just a formality
[1:15:03] i come to church on sunday
[1:15:05] regardless if june's daddy's there
[1:15:08] or not there he will he can drink his
[1:15:10] coffee alone
[1:15:12] and he knows that
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:15] but most people would say no now my my
[1:15:17] daddy's coming i ain't seen him in two
[1:15:18] three years
[1:15:19] well that's your fault
[1:15:21] if you ain't seen your daddy or mama or
[1:15:22] something two or three years that's your
[1:15:24] fault
[1:15:25] but it always happens on sunday remember
[1:15:26] or wednesday night
[1:15:28] you know we go to work
[1:15:30] monday tuesday and then wednesday we get
[1:15:32] a sinus infection or our cat's got
[1:15:34] diarrhea or something you know going on
[1:15:36] or we get some kind of little ailment on
[1:15:38] wednesday but now thursday morning god
[1:15:40] heals us
[1:15:42] and we go right on to work
[1:15:44] just like nothing happened
[1:15:46] then we get close to the weekend
[1:15:50] i don't know what's come over me i do
[1:15:54] the devil
[1:15:58] but now look what verse 13 y'all got
[1:16:00] quiet and then started laughing now
[1:16:01] watch this
[1:16:03] he that taketh not his cross
[1:16:08] he's transferred all that power of the
[1:16:11] cross
[1:16:12] now he's transferred it into what not
[1:16:15] just getting to the cross
[1:16:17] but bearing your cross
[1:16:20] he that taketh not his cross and
[1:16:23] followeth after me is not worthy
[1:16:25] of me
[1:16:26] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[1:16:29] and he that
[1:16:31] loses his life for my sake shall find it
[1:16:35] what my whole life your old life
[1:16:39] i'm like brother branham you know he and
[1:16:41] he even tells the story he said you know
[1:16:42] what he said to keep from from i guess
[1:16:45] from uh
[1:16:46] from uh um i don't know what uh same way
[1:16:49] with me i got busy on sunday like i said
[1:16:51] i don't go to church i got busy on
[1:16:53] sunday i scheduled stuff to do on sunday
[1:16:56] i went deer hunting or i went to a place
[1:16:57] i didn't you know you never mind
[1:17:00] brother branham now he tells a story he
[1:17:02] used to wax and wash his car on sunday
[1:17:04] and watching people go to church
[1:17:07] a prophet
[1:17:10] i wonder where the seed was then
[1:17:17] so anyway
[1:17:18] then jesus said unto his disciples
[1:17:21] now what is a disciple there's people
[1:17:23] that know jesus there was 500 brethren
[1:17:25] that knew jesus there were 70 that
[1:17:28] walked away they were not considered or
[1:17:30] ever called disciples
[1:17:32] disciples is one that follows a leader
[1:17:39] then jesus said unto his disciples if
[1:17:42] any man will come after me
[1:17:44] let him deny himself and take up
[1:17:47] his cross
[1:17:49] jesus never says
[1:17:51] take up my cross
[1:17:56] he says take up his cross
[1:17:58] and follow me
[1:18:00] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:18:02] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[1:18:05] for my sake shall find it thank god i
[1:18:08] have lost my old life and so have you if
[1:18:11] you're born again you've lost your old
[1:18:13] life
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:16] mark 8 verse 34 this is another part of
[1:18:18] what jesus was talking about when he had
[1:18:20] called the people unto him with his
[1:18:22] disciples also his followers
[1:18:25] he said unto them whosoever will come
[1:18:27] after me let him deny himself and take
[1:18:29] up his cross
[1:18:31] and follow me
[1:18:32] now i like this one luke is a physician
[1:18:35] he's more precise watch what he says
[1:18:37] none of the other one says this he's the
[1:18:39] only one that says this right here and
[1:18:41] he said unto them all if any man will
[1:18:43] come after me let him deny himself and
[1:18:45] take up his cross daily
[1:18:48] that puts it
[1:18:50] real
[1:18:52] intense
[1:18:54] well i'll take it in a few days and then
[1:18:56] i'll lay it down or i'll
[1:18:58] take up his cross daily
[1:19:01] and follow me
[1:19:03] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:19:04] lose it but whosoever will lose his life
[1:19:06] for my sake the same shall save it luke
[1:19:09] 14 verse 27 said whosoever doth not bear
[1:19:12] his cross
[1:19:14] and come after me why this is this is
[1:19:17] what we're this is what we're after
[1:19:21] he went first he was the first fruits he
[1:19:23] showed these characters he showed these
[1:19:26] fruits of the spirit he showed what it
[1:19:28] was and he showed it in the first church
[1:19:31] age first second third church age he
[1:19:33] showed these virtues and then he got
[1:19:35] lost man got to arguing and complaining
[1:19:38] sounds like today
[1:19:40] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:19:44] what bear his beam
[1:19:47] bear his beam
[1:19:49] and continue on
[1:19:51] not past the cross but with your cross
[1:19:56] that'll make you happy it's telling you
[1:19:57] what you got we got you say oh that's
[1:19:59] kind of i don't know
[1:20:01] bear burdens
[1:20:02] listen you never did have nails put in
[1:20:05] your hands i promise you that and you
[1:20:06] didn't hang there for almost five hours
[1:20:08] on a cross
[1:20:11] suffocating to death
[1:20:12] that's why they broke their legs if you
[1:20:14] didn't know that a little history you
[1:20:15] know why they broke those two guys legs
[1:20:18] number one was it was beginning to be
[1:20:19] the sabbath and they didn't want to
[1:20:20] leave them hanging up there the whole
[1:20:22] weekend
[1:20:24] so they would break their legs so they
[1:20:25] would suffocate faster
[1:20:29] but jesus has already had control of
[1:20:31] everything he said into thy hands i come
[1:20:33] in my spirit
[1:20:34] he was already dead
[1:20:37] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:20:39] about with so great a cloud of witness
[1:20:40] let us lay aside every weight
[1:20:42] and ascend with us so easily but set us
[1:20:45] and let us run
[1:20:46] we gotta run with this beam we don't
[1:20:48] just walk with it we gotta run with it
[1:20:53] run with patience
[1:20:55] the race that is set before us what
[1:20:57] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:20:59] finisher
[1:21:00] of our faith
[1:21:04] our faith
[1:21:07] for the joy that was set before him
[1:21:10] endured the cross
[1:21:12] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:21:15] the right hand of the throne of god and
[1:21:16] you know what he's saying come on
[1:21:20] come on
[1:21:21] i did it i did it you don't have to do
[1:21:23] it like i did all you got to do is pick
[1:21:25] up the beam
[1:21:26] all you gotta do is pick the beam up and
[1:21:28] follow me pick up your beam
[1:21:31] pick up your
[1:21:32] face
[1:21:34] virtue
[1:21:36] knowledge
[1:21:37] temperance and follow
[1:21:39] god
[1:21:42] last thought
[1:21:44] that's the position
[1:21:47] some don't even want
[1:21:49] some of them don't want to cross they
[1:21:50] don't care about the cross
[1:21:52] some of them use it in you know
[1:21:54] evil ways
[1:21:57] some come to the cross some may get born
[1:21:59] again come on somebody some may get born
[1:22:01] again come to the cross salvation
[1:22:03] salvation of the lord is of the lord
[1:22:05] justification even come to the baptism
[1:22:07] of the holy ghost but you got to pick up
[1:22:09] your cross
[1:22:11] and follow him continually on what the
[1:22:13] bible says to the regeneration or what
[1:22:16] the regening of me and you to regen this
[1:22:19] guy not make me look different
[1:22:21] but change me
[1:22:25] can you carry that beam
[1:22:28] god's already took it to the cross
[1:22:31] he's already hung there for me and you
[1:22:33] but he requires
[1:22:35] that's a requirement in matthew mark
[1:22:37] luke and john that's not a suggestion
[1:22:39] that's a requirement if we are going to
[1:22:41] get a position in christ we're going to
[1:22:44] have to bear
[1:22:46] must jesus bear
[1:22:49] the cross alone
[1:22:51] in what all the world go free
[1:22:53] no there's a cross
[1:22:55] for everyone
[1:22:57] and there's a cross for me
[1:23:00] must jesus bear
[1:23:02] this cross alone
[1:23:04] but you look in the bible and we'll look
[1:23:06] we'll keep going on further with this
[1:23:09] the bible even talks about bearing each
[1:23:10] other's burdens
[1:23:14] he says my yoke is easy
[1:23:17] and my burdens are light and we're
[1:23:20] wanting to make them heavy
[1:23:22] no i think i said it says right here
[1:23:24] look
[1:23:25] who for
[1:23:27] joy
[1:23:30] wow
[1:23:31] who for joy that was set before him
[1:23:35] endured the cross
[1:23:37] despising the shame listen he hung naked
[1:23:42] and when he died there's no doubt it was
[1:23:43] a mess his body fluids you know when
[1:23:45] somebody dies
[1:23:47] it wasn't pretty
[1:23:48] but he didn't care he did it for me and
[1:23:50] you he's just asking us to take the beam
[1:23:54] the beam of faith
[1:23:56] the beam of virtue knowledge temperance
[1:23:58] let's stand to our feet come on
[1:23:59] musicians
[1:24:00] he asked us to take those not getting
[1:24:03] nailed it was already the bible said our
[1:24:05] sins was already nailed to the cross
[1:24:08] already nailed
[1:24:12] he's already took our sins but what
[1:24:13] we're going to do is build character
[1:24:16] build character by a position
[1:24:21] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:24:22] finisher
[1:24:24] of our faith
[1:24:27] the bible says add to what add to your
[1:24:29] faith
[1:24:30] so as i said before that dunamis or that
[1:24:32] power that jesus said you will be endued
[1:24:34] with dunamis or power he's transferring
[1:24:36] every bit of that on to me and you
[1:24:40] what are you going to do with it i'm
[1:24:41] asking you tonight
[1:24:42] you're going to carry it on or you're
[1:24:43] just going to keep sitting here for
[1:24:44] another i hope we're not here another 20
[1:24:46] years i'll be 80 or 82 years old
[1:24:50] somebody is going to have to live this
[1:24:52] thing right here
[1:24:54] and not just live it but show it
[1:24:58] and it's not burdensome burdensome
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:01] if you do it in the right way
[1:25:04] it's a position
[1:25:06] you look at people at work
[1:25:09] and and i'm i've always been
[1:25:12] i've never been just staying where i was
[1:25:14] at at work i always wanted advance
[1:25:16] i always wanted to own a company and i
[1:25:18] did several
[1:25:20] and was successful
[1:25:22] several million dollars in sales we grew
[1:25:24] while i was the owner of the business
[1:25:26] that's no pat on my back but it's why it
[1:25:28] it's a drive
[1:25:29] i sure didn't get that getting up the
[1:25:31] crack of noon i'll promise you that
[1:25:34] sometimes june knows i got up at four
[1:25:36] and five o'clock in the morning loaded
[1:25:38] them trucks myself
[1:25:40] and went in the early part of our life
[1:25:43] that wasn't enough to sustain us so i
[1:25:45] would go on fire from from seven o'clock
[1:25:47] to 11 o'clock at night just to make some
[1:25:49] extra income and then go load my truck
[1:25:51] and start over again so
[1:25:53] don't tell me about work
[1:25:55] but this is a different kind of work
[1:25:57] to me this is pleasurable sometimes that
[1:25:59] was not
[1:26:01] this should be pleasurable oh i got to
[1:26:03] go to church oh if i got to go wear
[1:26:06] another dress i think i'll just go sneak
[1:26:08] around no you ain't sneaking
[1:26:11] i'm not looking at y'all
[1:26:13] i'm not
[1:26:15] i don't know why i looked over here
[1:26:17] but
[1:26:19] in god there is no sneaky
[1:26:24] man
[1:26:25] he knows it before you did it
[1:26:28] so there's no sneaky you might sneaky
[1:26:30] against your parents
[1:26:32] you might think you get by with it but
[1:26:33] you know what what brother brown say he
[1:26:35] said a christian
[1:26:36] sends a sin
[1:26:38] he will reap a tub full
[1:26:41] amen because you know what that's that
[1:26:42] iniquity thing you know to do better and
[1:26:44] you don't do it
[1:26:45] or either you do something you know you
[1:26:47] shouldn't do we need to think about that
[1:26:48] because you know what i read that
[1:26:49] scripture the other day i was reading it
[1:26:51] where iniquity will abound in the end
[1:26:53] abound
[1:26:54] so that means people do whatever look at
[1:26:56] this world
[1:26:58] they do what they want to do it don't
[1:26:59] matter if it's right or wrong
[1:27:01] they do it anyway
[1:27:03] with no consequence but they're going to
[1:27:04] have a consequence
[1:27:08] but let's not be enemies of the cross
[1:27:11] let's don't just come to the cross let's
[1:27:13] don't just find the cross
[1:27:15] let's bear a cross
[1:27:18] let's bear each other's burdens let's
[1:27:20] bear with each other
[1:27:23] somebody stumbles
[1:27:25] don't
[1:27:26] don't kick him while he's down
[1:27:29] right
[1:27:30] be like simon or cyrene reach over there
[1:27:33] and pick the thing up for him
[1:27:35] if you have to carry him for a little
[1:27:36] while so what
[1:27:41] jesus carries your sorry rear end didn't
[1:27:43] he
[1:27:43] when he was out in the world in our ups
[1:27:46] and downs and our stumbles back and
[1:27:48] forth
[1:27:49] he carried you and you know what he
[1:27:50] didn't grumble one bit
[1:27:53] so let's don't grumble
[1:27:54] gripe and complain
[1:27:56] no root of bitterness that's what we're
[1:27:58] going to keep talking we'll go up the
[1:27:59] statue of perfect man
[1:28:01] it's a position
[1:28:03] that all this is a position listen we're
[1:28:05] christians
[1:28:06] we've come to the cross we know that god
[1:28:09] died for me and you in human flesh we
[1:28:11] know that we know he's that rod that
[1:28:13] butted but you know what now you're a
[1:28:15] rod
[1:28:16] you have come to life
[1:28:19] you have blooded and now you are to
[1:28:21] produce the life that was in that limb
[1:28:28] let's sing a song god bless you
[1:28:30] think about these things
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:45] and renew our right spirit
[1:28:49] within me
[1:28:52] are you laughing
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:06] think about it
[1:29:08] and renew
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:13] david slipped up moses slipped up
[1:29:16] aaron slipped up
[1:29:18] cast me but there's a perfect one that
[1:29:20] we looked to
[1:29:22] when he born
[1:29:27] [Music]
[1:29:35] i'm sure they were buzzing around his
[1:29:36] head that day
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:40] remember brother ryan said satan said oh
[1:29:42] i got you now buddy
[1:29:44] i'll bring you down here and i'll lock
[1:29:46] you up just like i want to step up from
[1:29:48] the beginning of time
[1:29:51] but when that man went downstairs
[1:29:54] it was a different kind of man
[1:29:57] it was god
[1:29:59] and that same god
[1:30:01] is inside of you tonight if you have the
[1:30:03] new birth
[1:30:04] same god
[1:30:06] gets the same results
[1:30:08] that's our problem we're going to show
[1:30:10] results but if it's not god you're going
[1:30:12] to see the results
[1:30:14] we're going to bear whatever life is
[1:30:16] inside your limb
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:30] oh
[1:30:35] and renew a right spirit
[1:30:39] within me
[1:30:41] a change of mind and renewing
[1:30:45] not like
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:50] [Applause]
[1:30:53] there's a new way of doing things when
[1:30:54] you become a christian not the old way
[1:30:57] and brother brother even said not even
[1:30:59] the old way pastime
[1:31:01] is the old man dead
[1:31:04] jesus was dead on that cross his body
[1:31:08] did not have any life in it at all
[1:31:12] but that theophany when he came out of
[1:31:14] that body you and i were in that
[1:31:15] theophany with him
[1:31:17] he went to hell you went to hell you
[1:31:19] don't have to go you already been
[1:31:22] he came up to mighty conquerors so that
[1:31:24] you can conquer
[1:31:27] you can conquer
[1:31:29] all the things in this life
[1:31:32] overcomers
[1:31:34] oh i've got i've got my toothpick
[1:31:38] i got my toothpick
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:42] no it was a beam
[1:31:45] if the whole thing brother john weighed
[1:31:46] 300 pounds that thing probably weighed
[1:31:48] 100 at least and now the little frail
[1:31:50] jesus was trying to carry 100 pounds
[1:31:52] they had done beat him up all over the
[1:31:53] place they had whacked him all night
[1:31:55] that scourged him which means they
[1:31:56] whipped him and there he was naked
[1:31:58] walking through the streets with that
[1:32:00] beam on his shoulder
[1:32:04] sometimes we feel like
[1:32:05] we're having problems
[1:32:09] he took them all at calvary
[1:32:12] now let's turn that thing around and use
[1:32:14] the power of the cross
[1:32:15] [Music]
[1:32:17] to bear each other's burdens
[1:32:19] [Music]
[1:32:22] help brother dale different ones all of
[1:32:24] ministry help the ministry hold them up
[1:32:27] don't beat them down hold them up
[1:32:30] amen

[1:32:34] i heard a preacher the other day and i
[1:32:36] agree with him 100 if you don't make it
[1:32:38] to heaven it is not the preacher's fault
[1:32:41] it's your fault so don't name you can't
[1:32:43] come to the day of judgement and say
[1:32:44] well brother dale's the reason i ain't
[1:32:46] make it nope god's gonna say
[1:32:48] no
