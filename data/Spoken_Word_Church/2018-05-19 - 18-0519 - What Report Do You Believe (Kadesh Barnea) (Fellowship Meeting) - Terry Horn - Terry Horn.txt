Lawry could we bring this to a conclusion the next morning EEMA very very grateful amen the only part they messed up the keys so that old key would work you know we just got ourselves another kid we took up an assembly we started that thing sometimes our lives are like that you have to start over you have to destroy what doesn't work or or what's been corrupted yeah and get what's right because if it's right it'll start that's what the message is it's powerful because it has a restarting ability you've never done when you're in the message of the hour you can totally blow it you can you can be as bad as the Apostle Paul was killing Christians and still your life's just about to begin yeah that's one more reason why I love this message because he just just doesn't lose you let's sing one more song all you saints of life proclaim Jesus the light of the world himself my child it will take away from this understanding the promise to Jesus and promises the revelation of the word amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] the eyes of the world it just looks like a very small little meeting small little building a small little people but in the eyes of God it's the greatest thing that's happening on planet Earth is this moving this message amen and we're part of it how many can say you're part of it for the good for the bad for every bit of pain that caring preaching ears every bit of overcoming you're part of all of it amen amen let's sing that song you ask me why I'm happy [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] there's something about you ever lose something mom would always tell me go remember where you had at last brother Brandon when he was dealing with that one believer who had lost his is closest to the Lord his joy in the Lord they said go back to where last you remember when you had God and I think we can all say there's a point where we went up to the altar and we put our all in it on that altar and we threw ourselves before the cross and said Lord forgive me in such joy fill our souls that's a great place to start if you're just if the world side attracts you you can look back to that cross and you can trace your steps from there and see where he went wrong yeah I was ever so ready to put us right back on that path he does it for me pretty much every day because this world is a nasty mean place but God has ever been as good as as as we need to combat that amen let's sing that song it truly is the center of our universe the cross is the center of my universe at the cross [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Thomas next thing usually right after the cross that you feel this is an intense gratitude to the Lord to think when they say such acts of love I've had that where I was in a hard spot and someone I didn't even know would just do so much for me and that brings about a real feeling of love and gratitude when Christ did it in spite of me being the worst I could possibly be he reached down like that if that doesn't fill you with love not only for him but you're for each other then we need to go back to the cross and try again because it truly is overwhelming when God reaches down to us amen and start the course [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you're saying how much God's done for us and I think I can do so much more for us we just believe I truly believe that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

frustrated don't believe and just believe the song instead believe those believe the anointed of God songs and and the life that you've seen it's a bluff the devil cannot win and so he is gone to

brother Bennett preach Satan Z for a god of his evil age and you know I live back nowadays you know I didn't see what he was talking about but now we see it manifested every day and then we see all things done the passion that for where we were living a mentor you know what amen you steal the churches amen even the lower churches had some morals and then they had character amen but the day shirt a menace totally insane Z god bless you Crusaders [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] amen in that I think it's time to hear the preaching the word did one mention again the embassy capital of Israel it's in Jerusalem I don't honestly know exactly what that means but I know that Israel is real important to God and I know that these events means something and one day it will be the last serving your perfect yeah there will come a time much there yeah it would be the last critic you ever heard because the master called knows that little goats but Israel is quite a nation's it my Cairo hater she's not going anywhere because the Bible says she stand and there will be an awakened in Israel I don't understand all of it but I believe it I don't understand why God wouldn't allow brother Brown to go to Israel but I believed it and he stood there and Egypt wanting to go and with this going but it wasn't time I believe the time is coming it's a different time amen so I'm just grateful to be a Christian so grateful what Jesus Christ did it across so grateful him sending the Spirit at Pentecost so grateful today that we can live in that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in us we ought to be the happiest people in the world let's all stand in hundred our King and lip-synch only beliefs because all things are possible

in a hurry you know something they say when a preacher gets behind the pulpit young time against it just kind of see some question it's not really that bad but you know we get in that presence you just cha like the staging yeah I'm just gonna let you stand a few minutes coach you've been seated a little while and why he turns the book of Romans he tends adapter Thank You musicians one of the brothers out there then said I was made military use here eight years ago wasn't listening Kasai he said he preached the message forsaking all others said I remember that well well and he's still in the message so he took although certainly thankful for that and thankful that well I've been in the message about 38 years I got saved when I was about 23 came commission when I was about 29 and said well you know young people you can do it because I was 23 when I got say you know and I was just as my even I was just in the denomination back then for about eight or nine years I was fervent love the Lord had to see you Lord Jesus you you can do it yeah it's a jumble it's worse the thing has never been but God's grace always supply Miss Anita and he always will keep you we are such a blessed people you talk about blessing they that we're singing that song a little while ago we got so much to thank you for I was privileged to make 10 trips overseas for to Africa and Tanzania dar Salam the capital of the tents and the three to five million people of just an average house their little mud up with a dirt floor another you know sample you know with good you know around it and TN roofers X roof and you know maybe one room two rooms at the most you know no water no facilities nothing just just that's the way it is you know we in America were burdened down with all the mojitos and insurance and cars and guns and this and that is that they don't have know that you don't have her today just try to find them make a little money to buy a few bananas or something don't they're surviving but they love the Lord they believe the same message anyway they had a meeting over there in five six hundred people three automobiles three automobiles they've all wrote bus you know whatever - your many blessings Romans chapter 10 I know probably something I'll probably do about four months ago I had open-heart surgery and I thought I was gonna get to go home but more than not you can't come home yeah you know so I had a triple bypass but I've I've really done well the Lord's been really big feeling good I'm 68 years old at least I was four months ago feel like I'm 58 and I'm feeling better and more no they think so brother hum right they I don't think I'll never get as old as you are you been through so much we love we love all the ministers brother all of you the bride we just listen this is the greatest truth has ever struck there this is our bleep revelation of Jesus Christ right Anna that's right I've been in 38 years I wouldn't trade it for anything there's nothing out there there's no place to go there's nothing to trade it for there's nothing worthy obviously this is it so I'm just happy you know but I was saying it in the Bible or conflate revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel you know thinking about the boys you know and because we had one push for this generation not Satan Pence standing so he he's have to manufacture and actually pervert many voices so he's got hundreds thousands of voices all kinds of horses I mean you could go through maybe you go through politics you could go through every avenue there's all kinds of voices out there to try to stumble you know to get you off the beaten path and cause you to doubt and not believe what report are we gonna listen to yeah in fact we're gonna talk about that a little bit this afternoon listen you know use that preacher when he dances he preaches usually drinks of something increased before but I've been studying on this trip for months I've never preached this before I guess so guess what you all are the first for this Romans chapter 10 verse 13 reads like this for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Mars 14 how then shall they call on him and whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel bring glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel before he saying sir Isaiah said who has believed our report as isaiah 53:1 and he said in summer of 76 so then our answer is old navi's - he's a secret who has believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God the notice there's something very interesting well this parade mileages be seated Heavenly Father were so thankful Lord to be in the house of God yes so thankful is the brother said to be the house of God but thank the Lord that you desired even from the foundation of the world you knew the fall you know about it you orchestrated everything they had to be followed but all of them through time there was a plan of redemption you desire to live and Tabernacle back in human beings again and here we are in the last day the last message the last time before the two prophets of revelation 11 rise up and take them this same gospel to Israel but we've had a Gentile prophet to bring this great message to we might have the complete full revelation of Jesus Christ we love you less Lord I pray the word is already anointed and don't mean to speak the point to people that hear hide me behind the cross may something be said that would be a eternal value as we leave the building this afternoon we could say did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way bless your children in Jesus name everybody says maybe they're gonna meet my seat for the invitation appreciate that just Tommy this is real many many years ago back in Arkansas we go way back choosing the right report so faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God now it's very interesting when you take this suit your faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word by the Word of God that you go back and look that up in the Patti dialogue and it reads like this so faith comes and of course the Fatih dialogue is just the original Greek word by word they just put it in a flowing way it's so that faith comes from a report and the report through the Word of God says the same thing that's actually just a little bit more clear where it says it's faith cometh by hearing but you you've got to have something to hear what are you hearing you're here to report so faith comes from my report and the report through the Word of God so he's saying who has believed our report and I was in 53 up there's 12 verses east he talks all about the oldest sufferings and the prophecy of the Messiah so he's asking you and he before it actually comes to pass that who out there is gonna believe my report before it happens that takes faith to believe a report before it happens so therefore must be run through the Word of God it must be channeled through the Word of God it must be backed up by the Word of God so we will continue my face we've got done we better be careful what report we listen to that's right amen so in deal with us off we want to examine the effects of Katies cornea we're gonna learn something this afternoon my ministry is kind of teaching him and I didn't know and I'm sure you're going to learn some things in fact Hades Barnet that you didn't know because I did several months ago and actually what really happened to Katie's cornea it's a game-changer when you learn just a few what really happened you'll see more why those twelve spies tenderly tended and to bleed tended believe you're going to see why what they did was such an awful harm palm the state that they dedicate then we uh read some application out of that probably one of the most important principles actually happened to Kate's Barnea and so I'm going to labor that go to detail so I want everyone to see in fact the church Berlin see it stands at Katie's right now I'm gonna read a few posts the tabernacle right now stands at Katie's carnea look that he was so close till they even tasted that grapes out of the land they eat the grapes when came over them whenever came back with the grapes in fellas pulled off some and eat them oh that are good but we can't do it and there they have tasted the good word of God have tasted the Holy Spirit seen the good tasted of it and it tasted the Word of God see not none of the enemy have not one of them ever permitted to go over they perished in their own land over here in the wilderness they never went over yet they was so close they can't even taste it how close are we today come on so close to promised to actually crossing over so close they taste it but not enough grace and pace to take it that's what it is another place residences oh brother sister word it take the screen off of her Nina you're tasting it now another place he says Rick hey sweetheart scuse me and pages partying and God's Word said we can take it we're getting ready to cross over plus we really are brothers Daniel we ought to get II rented the car to cross over let's go back to Ankara here we kind of pick this up and just kind of go through some background just a little bit I want you to get this background and Genesis 15 3 you don't have to turn to and he said a neighborhood no I'm a charity that dynasty shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and she'll serve them they still afflict them 400 years so here's the process they're going to be down there for 100 years I spent in 430 verse 14 and also that nation whom they shall serve when Iowa generates an expert you know they come out with great substance on my kids were coming out of Egypt to see the seed of Abraham will be in a strange land for 400 years you know what happens with people get in a strange land they miss the strange things and it's our strengths yeah and sometimes they would come straight you this is a strange idea you you and I endorse that and think about it too long you're going to become that so stay away from that strength ideas yeah Jacob in his family they finger pretty well down Itza well Joseph was still alive but you know they wrote after Joseph died the Rosa Rosa for failure who forgot thee the death that that Joseph really because what he did eat you OB Joseph this one multiplied each a got real concern then after that they'll also freedom just kind of kind of go suit some offense they've become slaves and Natalie in the land of bondage and remember for about three hundred years the two individuals they were actually influenced by and ography so you see after after the failure of the new Jose after he died a new Pharaoh come home then he forgot about the debt that they hope to Jacob and Joseph with his really Joseph in his family and so they begin to insert beginning to multiply so they begin to make slaves out of my persecutor we put them in bondage now because for the about three hundred years they actually was so influenced by tradition of tradition to my dollar Creek just like Laodicea and how many how many years are have we been actually influenced by the traditions and we've back in the pinnacle the Church of different churches we come out up I mean we had to forget one idea to come into the message but we was influenced by that for years whose influence but we had to lay all that data coming to the truth and finally their afflictions got some bad thing they finally prize for deliverance Mosul's is born races favor us house trials delivered Israel course he failed then he pleads to the desert marries it has a family finally he meets God in a burning bush it's a gun survey he met God he finally got hold of something real even though he was ordained to that he met God it returns back to Pharaoh says now let my people go but see by this time this to to me to ask people doing half-million people they were really ready to go because they've been mended bodies for all these years beaten the mistreating and slaves and they kill their babies in horrible conditions just like layoffs see today kind of like the day the horrible conditions we're losing our freedom that killed the babies idolatry our message is persecuted we know we've had faint roads we've had Kennedy in Johnson and Nixon Clinton and Obama and who knows what we got how you know well he's better than then Hillary I guess but then another who's going to go what you say well we've had a little reprieve I don't know we've had a little free of me this his wife comes up Melania starts Catholic so we don't know where he's going but we know where it's going we go where it's going so that's the main thing so we can have all kinds of Figaro soon and they begin to you know they went with when God began to bring them out of the land of Egypt they saw all kinds of miracles there's all the ten plagues and fell on the Egyptians ourselves now all that ten evil plays but you know the children fizzled out they found favor with your hoho God so the kind of the Red Sea and this imposing what she did what she already do it God delivers again and they dance and shout you know I'm married with the tambourine because they were delivering this all you know Pharaoh and his army was drowned they're delivered one more taxing Wow yeah we're on the world I wrote to the promised land you know we've been promised a promised legroom we're coming out of Egypt we've seen all these planes now happy you know I just found favor with us we found favor than him just through it Egypt you know the chariots are gone we're being women the problems they pretty soon so that was excited yeah and this listen let's gotta get the picture yes sir you know that they were really excited about what's taking place now in Exodus chapter three years now that the promise sin I had company after deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians and just bring them up out of the land the land into a good land and a large land and flowing with milk and honey unto a place of the Canaanites and the hittite hasn't memorized the PERS rise in the high rise and Egyptian get besides and they they absolutely knew that God had promised him back land now I promise you that man the land that God promised us her after he promises away but somebody somebody's gonna listen to the wrong report but somebody has done this to the rider floor Leviticus but I have said you you shall inherit their man what a promise and I will give it unto you to possess it laying the folks with milk and honey hind the Lord your God with him separated you from other people God always we want to his bride to be separated he wanted him to be separate he said you're not even wrecking for the nation's he wanted to be separated and that's why when you come out of her revelation 18:4 second competing at 6:17 we are supposed to be a separated people right and a lot of people want to deal it down Ali with the world and you know and that straddle Vince hasn't word with holiness or whatever more oh here if you're gonna be God's bride you're going to be separated not going to be like the world you're not going to be God fries one of the other so actually they had a promise that covenant a land of their inheritance and actually just looking at it this way God actually had been preparing this Promised Land for these four hundred years while they were down Anita seven nations these think about these seven nations and hypnotize first rising all om nice arm the land they build cities they build roads they do houses they live wheels they rancor they raise corn they actually they got the land all ready for this because they didn't know it but they did yeah they actually I mean they actually got the land prepared for them was gonna take it but God all along he was repairing that land jesus said I go away to prepare a place for peace for favorite of course and you got the land already for the doing happiness God knows all about the land it's a good land I'm giving you ladies talk about 150 miles from Egypt all you got to do is just and that was so happy work we're leavin easier out of bondage we're going to the promised land oh how excited they were that's all goes hand to deliver to come out I delivered direct see the place of miracles you just think make the matter in the West over see how God delivered and they they say all this miracle so they were so excited we're inheritance we'll have just a few weeks did it now stay away don't you understand in this background now they traveled they left Egypt they traveled one year in one month and came to Mount Sinai they spent 11 months is now Sonia remain about 20 stop including outside here in Phoenix Barnea and finally they arrived at Katie's party and two years later two years right we times out of Egypt two years later they arrived at Taste party now Davis Barney is a very very special place a very special place memory now there in the world of forty years after two years their taste Katie's for Nia is actually the border of cross the ends of the promised land Katie's partying is actually the gate length into the Promised Land because the people or today's journey that actually would be there yes now that case let's talk about caves a little bit this is where this is where the plot for the thickens and as I said you're not going to we I didn't even know this until I really got this researching this and it changes the whole aspect of how we look at this spies in the spy mission brother Bennett says now that game is change party up in Cadiz Barney was at one time of the judgment seat of the world the place had great big whale big Springs there was many little Springs out of it a palm grove like in the desert what a beautiful place they tied a great judgment seat of God in heaven where God's Word is a law book and their judgment at the bottom of heaven and every little spring representing the church where the judgments of God go for breaching judgment when they found there they were on the border of the promised land you can understand that a cage party was on the book as actually was a game range but when he came down on the corner when he comes to the border of the promised land on the border that's where they made their big mistake they stopped the border net was an emotional scene as they made their fatal mistake when they fail to go home they were on their journey not not very many miles more they could have made it in a few days with all this two million people out of it out of the desert if they stay on the path but when they came to a place called cage Barnea Hades party at what time I'm told the great judgment seat it sends a great spring of oil there and many little wells a perfect time for the church the church is the judgment seat maybe you say something the churches we know the Bible says we all got to stand before the judgment of God now worry is gonna take our judgment here or we're going to fix it there in the church and the house of God people don't want to come to church and hear our preaching and have get reconciled back to God cause we're gonna have to face it come to the house of God preached to me tell me what I'm doing wrong don't resist love it these don't have to so we're gonna get in one place or the other collision in the mail because judgment is mixed with mercy here yes when we talk about judgment well we're not actually our sins is already judged we know that but is a house of correction we've got to be corrected human beings are just not flawless we've got to be corrected yeah hey man so remember now half of its in we're at taste party oh right now now Cadiz was a special place you know what a nice party it means hey the word Cadiz means holy the word Barnea meets a desert of wandering so what it means a holy place in a desert of wandering so they were a caged Barnea actually it was a little oasis out there in the desert it was a holy place of the judgment seat of the world at one time he says it's a holy place in the desert hundred and it was part of the desert of Cu which isn't that big a desert you know so it's a little oasis out there that's where the church is we're read where in case where the judgement seat and go that it is an oasis hadn't we have an oasis had we had the word come and we exceed on it and the water supply three minutes oh brother if you talk about those oasis we had an Alexa we're happy going say that they're being a water would be in there to remove innit you got last amen brother a holy place in a desert of wandering so let's look at Deuteronomy chapter one okay now what happened page he said well I don't know the story no you don't know the story and when I think I like yoga well you don't have to but we get to over two numbers one again Deuteronomy one I want you to follow with me but just listen there are only one 119 when they departed it from Horo they went through all the great terrible illness which he saw by the way to the mountains of the MRIs as the globe and I God commanded us and we came to case Barnea and I said if you you are coming to the mountains of the amorite which the Lord our God doesn't give unto us behold the LORD thy God has set the man before they go up and possess it and the Lord my God my father's hand since the fear not needs going to be disturbed or - a fear not because he knew there's going to be some bad yeah but he said I've given you this land so now here's here's something that we were looking at this is a key than available state already Katie's Lansing place who requested the spy mission to log shoot we know that I mean well God Bible says God God the ordered this five issue of did he well this seems me did who requested the spiders because human requested is actually the real critical crux of the whole issue mind already listen remember I already do about the land he you know he made the land he's but he that didn't happen it's good there he proved you know that he was God he's gonna make it to Lana I've given you the land but they artists all the miracles Wow well I wanted so who would his fastest I turned any Bibles to numbers chapter 13 what you don't you to read it out your vitals cuz we're gonna read two different places that I'm gonna actually I want to show you something and parallels very closely the water baptism as far as disappears number thirteen and one when everybody to read follow it you gotta say man numbers 13 find the Lord spake unto Moses say the Lord spake unto Moses saying see the Delvian this they may search the land which I give unto the children Israel and every tribe of their fathers ye stand and each one of the room among them and Moses by the commandment of the Lord set them from the wilderness of Paran all those men were heads of the gym of Israel said well that sells well does that's one scripture now I want to ask you a question if I ask you to give me a scripture about water baptism and so you give me Matthew 28:19 and just one scripture does that once picture give me the identification of the answer not myself right not the understanding and we didn't have that understanding years ago but now I want to see that one scripted but see in the mouth of two or three witnesses that never were to be a statute all right so here we have it was with sig's like in the Bible says by the Moses by the commandment of the Lord sit them over there okay all right that's good now let's read the rest of the story that's what he Deuteronomy chapter 1 now in Deuteronomy chapters one two and three this has written the fortieth year and Moses actually is Greek recounting the whole 40-year wilderness journey and the experiences in the wilderness and so he's given up a notary for you or a review in chapters 1 2 or 3 of Deuteronomy 1 and he's actually just reflecting back and telling a pretty detailed how things went you know in the woods and the reason he did that is because you know everybody in over 20 years old had died at all so he was explaining to the young Generation Y was so important to knocked out but to believe God's Word why they had to stay 40 years why didn't God ever intended them to just be able to use his will because he never intended that he intended to take them right straight to the promised land yeah for two years they should have been in there they should have been there now and Deuteronomy chapter 1 let's start with the person I think you'll you'll see something here in just a minute everybody read with me and when they departed from Mora we came through all the great terrible wilderness which he saw by the way of the mountain of the hammerites as the Lord our God commanded us and we came to Kay's far near and I said it to you ye are come to the mouth of the anoraks which the Lord our God give us unto us and behold the LORD thy God hath sent the land before thee go under possess it that's that's the or go tackle and go comes in and as the Lord God the Lord God of Our Fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discerned now look at verse 22 and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we should send man before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up into what cities we shall come really what the congregation the congregation where the people requested the congregation requested this population we go to Canada and Moses say and ye came near unto me every one of you and say will see it appear before us in the land and bring us word again by what we went wait we must go and into the cities we shall come the congregation yes certainly did and listen verse 23 and in the same please me well and I took 12 minutes you won't have a try I thought God did now mother said he did what do you see general Underwood 22 is actually the explanation specter of numbers 13 3 just like just like acts 2:38 is the explanation scripture of Matthew 28:19 understanding how many vampires had a leave out of Aurora household marriage divorce you name it but God says something sir yeah we had an ear here so we find out now that the congregation order to spy mission and God said okay I'll give you the land I prepared the land but if that's what you want okay go ahead God's got a perfect wheel and he's not permissive with if you won't take it perfect well it's the same thing with Dana you know that we tried you what going on here tree beat your mate got change luck okay prophecy is will scattered like sheep without a shepherd God said you're gonna have your life just put it up there but one God's perfect will forgive me and this one's God's perfect will begin with it but that's what the people look so if I branded it he created - okay let's let you walk you going to pay for it huh you gonna make up you don't know what you're asking for but you gonna pay for it oh mercy see this is a game-changer right here this this one why just go I said here's the land go take go take it so this is you know what we're hearing is is we're gonna spring down we've been ready to cross over we've seen the miracles we've seen the ten plagues we see Goshen we've seen the firstborn to litter we've seen all these things of man o bc o probably seen it all but but but but what are you not sure you know we've been out here two years now all right we better we better take this thing up first why do you wanna check it out easily you don't need to check it out the letters there thank God God did these foundation you already know everything about the congregation wanted this five issue oh brother sister that changes everything look in numbers 13 32 now Isaiah says who has believed our horse so now we found we've got 12 spies to go over there and we won't get in that part out of twelve fives they searched you out the land they over there forty days they come back tennis fans come back with the evil report two spies come back with a good report which report are you going to believe yeah so we're down to the question wait to report are you going to believe you got two against ten well let's go with the majority you know what happens when you're in the majority I'll take my ways with the Lord's despise team don't go with the majority they're normally under 30 numbers 1332 and they brought up an evil report what a never a how can the Promised Land the Promised Land evil work hard easily excellent but you had out of the 12 unbelievers which they had surgeons of the children who saved the land though which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants and all the people that we saw in Oh salt sa good hold that just a minute all the people that we saw in our mirror great statute really well they figure this yo first 33 30 33 and there we saw again sold there we saw the Giants the sons of eight we saw the Giants the sons of a hat you know you don't any sons ain't a head to they will pray about to course they had never touch God's everybody you know they said the giant here the son that to summons but anyway and we were in and which come other Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight I want to ask you who told them what they were in their sight so how do these ten spies come say well we were in their sizes like grasshoppers you told them that lie yeah oh it gets better it gets better number fourteen one and cry and the people wept that night oh you know I mean I was going to the promise man what am I gonna do with my hammock and what am I gonna do with my cattle and what am I more than the Promised Land you know what do you mean there's gonna be some battles I mean there's going to be some hardship God supposed to give me the land I could just go in there and sit out in my easy chair he said God get supreme grace and supreme our never remember it to be easy but he said I'll give you that man so all the congregation of the voices they cried after they got a report that night they cried all night long and murmur and complain and whisper and criticize us now after after seeing all the miracles and see what the great sermon Moses was Gordon the greatest prophet on the earth up until this time notice the next verse first numbers 14 and 2 and all the children's are words against Moses and against Aaron and the whole time the whole congregation stay under gun under them why God that we had died in the land of Egypt Oh would God we had died in the world you realize they just they just heard out their own death sentence they justify the bow said you by year by year contain [Applause] don't take the land what you got to do is just go in there please take the land but we we need a spy missions we've never seen what way to go how big the inhabit is so that's it okay that's what you it may not turn out real good and what a good that we had not at each other guys we perished in the wilderness be careful what you say brother sister being careful what you said numbers 43 and we're for half and we're and we're for half the law now they're going to blame God we're gonna have to lower it into this runs into this land tell us all about the sword then I realize that our children should be prey we're not better for us to return unto Egypt I can't believe I read it we're a bad mother we're it not been for us returnees you may go back into that bondage yeah go back to that super here bondage and hardship back to this is our nation back to the World Council of Churches back to the the things that come out why would anybody want to go back the word with God so who they say they want they said were not better if we just returned back to Egypt and they said maybe sad one to the first for 1404 and they said one to another let in on this when I agreed I read this does The Times of India astounds me let us make a captain and let us return back you know what I even think about that it's just Apollo's all of the bad scene God had done for them yeah there was in bondage of their fathers and forefathers and foremothers for 200 years but but dr. Porter man was a mighty handsome they never the time of deliverance was now they saw the miracles they saw how a gun it brought them out and after Tilly year after two years they began to forget what for just two years another one to go back brother I can just tell you right now a lot of people why why are they leaving this message it's like this you see when the revival comes a revival you know the embers are real hot burning the flames oh well and everybody's on fire then you've got the second generation begins to die a little more another generation begins about a little boy yes you see savings got one advantage every day that the Lord tarries time sometimes Saint used to his advantage everybody time he uses time to wear it down the people to where the people gotta make you make them wear so they're making it a tire they get you know I just I'm just I'm too tired to fight I'm kind of you know people just say show them they struggling struggling and I'm just kind of counter if I give audibly up then instead of going to church and putting up with the things of dirt how big I'll just stay home and stream I missed high return you were to stay home instead why are you or stay home e-string got a house tonight syriza it's easy to stay home and get your iced tea and your vanilla wafers and get you feeling up and streaming service that's not in church [Music] you know get off you need a place to go if you're too far away but don't easy road out and you know what they did they actually did choose the captain they never actually went back because they did actually choose the captain and take them back to each other and then you understand 1410 but all the congregation not only you talk about respecting or disrespecting the Prophet all the congregation based on their bait stone stone them with stones and others that were so distraught with Moses they just never destroyed kill him brother we're just kill their leader their prophet just just kill the man we got a camp to take a back seat you get why we did Prophet we got a camper you take it back they do not mention why we need a prophet mom you know what you know when the saint of this to me to a missile war that's what you give and the Lord said at the moment in here here's what God said and the Lord said of the Moses how long will this people provoke me how will it be here they believe me no but they won't believe me the whole problem is unbelief come down to that unbeliev yeah believe me for all the science which I have showed them no words God had vindicated the Prophet go ahead show them science showed them wonder showed them miracles holy the cave of manna gave a water to lose all the things you gave and yet after two years they have these people I got to put up with this unbelieving generation of peanut oh the same that showed them they showed them the pillar of fire go game of a pillar of cloud hang in the water he gave her the man from the dead that there were no plates and indochine they parted the Red Sea go destroy the trailer he showed his presence and Sahni I began to my oasis in the California he promised on the land the fluid from with milk and honey he gave them alone we gave him a piece of it and then they want to kill the prophet and then we'll make a captain to take a fake what more can he do what what more could he do what move because as I've said as a prophet he said he [Applause] before all the people fine all he talks to the revelations tier 1 to 7 he said that the missing of God would be revealed us if somebody was saying it up in the service all the different things that we understand that the revelations and the mysteries and the truths and the understanding to the Bible all the good at centers this poppet and they want to kill the Prophet the Prophet and leave this mansion why I ask why all of these done all the different things that he showed us and give us understanding Quran actually talked about a couple of things here believe I believe this report but the judgment kind of shrimp believers but listen I mean we haven't been given so many wonderful revelations couple of my time down choose the Lord baptism truth of the Godhead the serpent see this is 144,000 are true eternal security to print predestination the seven churches the seventh seal the name of the second messenger souls under the order of the fifth seal in the future home the drive is in the city the New Jerusalem the difference between between the appearing in the coming mr. bakwin Sadducees be seen as the in the harlot the seven dimensions the seven thunders the three bodies the three works of Greek the third exit at home no one no one no the third pull the alert of the rapture the final manifestation the light of the Spirit the miracle of Pentecost no eternal man a weird birth not just on the spirit in the soul now Israel he is ready to make their choice either leave the two spies on the positive part or believe the 10 spies and therefore they can't make for the report so they had to decide but which one with an illegal can you take the later we're going to take the land or we can't take so you know what they did it took the easier right now yeah you know why because he get that the second 12 spies do came back with the grapes he came back from the crops ya can do it he can do it why they grabbed me complain that God gave me the land and I don't care how big these giant so if this 40-foot tall God slay that 10 is fine go back to report it was not God's Way over the other 140 years that was there for the Heisman 40 days is fine 40 years of the wielders one day one year that's your punishment you shouldn't have to request this - why didn't even request this - I gave you go ahead go take it now you're punished because you're gonna stay here and you're gonna wander around and read over 40 long years and guess what the old-timers are gonna die off because they didn't believe him straight to claim to be a happy a wholly obedient people but they could not enter because of their unbelief didn't unconsecrated leaders who depended on strength at numbers instead of God tennis club's leaders brought back and either in report let's put it this way didn't those preachers both brought back an evil report but all those things down at God said they despised the promised land God said that in Psalm 106 2048 they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord therefore he lifted up his hand against them - overthrew them in the wilderness so what happened to you and I'm so excited they were so excited about being a director I mean feeling a promise like no so it's in thews how about going into the after two years or ten or 15 or 20 or 30 however many of expense that you've been in a basin what happened in those years you've seen the hand of God you've seen that this you've indicated you've seen what truth is why are some still falling away what happened in those two years they saw ten evil plagues public Egyptians now that's all ten even preachers let an evil report following them cause of unbelief no mrs. now the yellow faith two million Israelites this is tremendous take the innovative too busy to be initialised the case for Nia was sowing the result of the negative influence and recommendation of temperatures 10 spies so you don't believe it absolutely I'm gonna say that you know too many lives elasticated was sowing there was the result of again the negative influence and the negative recommendation of these ten spies that came back said we just can't take the lead yeah God gave them the land the ten preachers talked about of it was a lie to begin with said how was the life we want proof okay forty years later Ram who was living in the promised land when they went over there she said to those two men that came up spy out the land which God actually Saints in next two minutes five missions she said to them I know this is 40 years later and she's living you know then this man needed something habits in we're like grasshoppers nearside this and that this talk about life it was a ladder to get brain I didn't believe that right she said she said I mean I know that the Lord has given you the land and that your terror is folded on us and all and all and all of the inhabitants of the land they change because of you that was the first terrorist that was the first terrorist no he said your terror has been all of our people but we have heard listener who hath believed our report before it comes to pass when you came out of Egypt and what he did for the two kings of them rest on the other side of Jordan Sidon and on whom he utterly destroyed and assumed as soon as we heard or courage in any manner because of you but the 10 spies said we're afraid we can't make their great there's something that their hand against theirs then zoom in sir whatever their giants we can't take the lid say you can go without your brother that's not going to be easy to take this rapture but he'd give it to us and we're gonna take it side of the Pope and everybody else we're gonna be there amen I hear this evil report calls to them the whole congregation think of it the influence of teen man cause the whole car wish to die spiritually die spiritually can you believe that Jesus said here call the city mana and the witness and there every woman who that said Eterna separates it not one of them say forty years old too many people my halls a town because of unbelief and they were God's chosen and to and then go around and show excited wonders and miracles and and bang it up and took care of her like a father with his children and then they disregarded and mother mum murdered and groomed and was going to kill the property chosen to take this Lord would you think about why why did they ever request a spy mission oh brother sister all the cause of an egg report I wonder what would be the faith of those who left the message instead and you know who listened to relieving the sign or believe the us or perhaps that you don't really need oh ministry and we don't forget a lot about the bridge you know they don't know what's going to be in everything I think what their fate is we the same fate as those two being died in the widow's touch my mind want to do my prophets of all right what so if faith comes by hearing so faith comes from a report and report through the Word of God so now I needed by the other hour but I'll take about ten minutes all right want to bring a little pair little application here so we found that we found out what really happened Kate's Barney was like we always saw the congregation requested this finally said worst worst thing that that was their fatal mistake where say they ever did God said go take it they should just whatever it took yeah they probably would have some cash be some loss of life be said he'll take it but if you believe he believed Donovan hey they they want any loss of life at Jericho they believe God did what God said Thompson we said yeah what happened yeah what happened with Aiken somebody got greedy somebody didn't follow the commandments of the Lord yeah now these teens 5 10 10 it's one of theirs up it could be a parallel anywhere an application with 10 I got to think about that the 10 plagues need you did evil spies 10 the 505 you to report and I'm going to maybe because Abraham Katie Hagar 10 years after Nathan came to know that that wouldn't be application but we sure see the ill effects of what happened when Abraham went into Hagar the Arabs in the and it's they've been fighting ever since the Lord since the God I want to know what's going to happen since Jerusalem you know my daddy here I'm glad it here I mean living for 20-some years they've been saying that I'm not telling me but the troops would miss a capital of Israel let's let it be it's been on the books let's let it be God recognizes a cap broke by the world but why does everybody want Jerusalem everybody more serious yeah why does everybody want Jerusalem maybe ten maybe because it's got food five ten righteous and it's sort side of my life would be it may be Joseph's ten brothers taking on I couldn't be in the ten commandments know the only said ten that's 15 years ago I go man I know red dragon seventy it's ten horns maybe either the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar screen or iron and clay Oh nobody you know irony plate Eisenhower and Khrushchev do you realize each one of those Eisenhower's ten letters Khrushchev ten letters maybe that's it but the Lord revealed reading there's there's a chance that we need to look at about five minutes there is a template is clicking and and this is these are the worst fans in the world I'm going to tell you I'm going to give you the ten were spies in the world I know their name it's been revealed to me these tens files a green report an equal report every time every time you can't trust them you can't depend on you shouldn't listen to them they'll never tell you the truth most of time you let me tell you what their names are how many want to know what the means evil preachers will give you the names ready see taste feel smell hear conscious reason nice nation they bring an evil report every inspires you listening to spies you know what your fakes I want to be or said well I mean that not previous know the food is virgins they thought this predestinate for active - yeah for the medicine they listen they don't even say be safe US attorney all the thermos verses they thought they was under was good they thought they had the Holy Ghost they thought they were sealed in that time came oh we don't have you old maybe we better go buy the oil maybe we better get the Holy Ghost well sorry God shut the door whenever that is but they thought they was under the blood these 10 preachers 10 spies see they still smell here comes freedom animate memory infection you know we actually start right now know that I have owned these ten evil spies she especially seeing here right the congregation should have never ever ever requested the spy mission that was her fatal mistake they died quickly after God sent a plague to kill those ten spies that's what happened those ten these preachers face come upon the report at scoff report because report is always positive well report are we listening to you know who believes the report today we will die spirit one of the most evil listener I could I could I'm not going to be talking about fifteen twenty thirty minutes one of the most see reports I know of is Facebook yeah yes calls in suicide social media what's calls at teen suicide why so many teenagers suicide Facebook are they actually are addicted to actually they can't spend ten minutes and so what what has happened what is happening this it's actually a said it's a trick of the devil's what it is yeah they hit them so addicted there and they go through the school and because this social media everyone sticks in this room does Texas with this one didn't get as many taxes get as many thumbs up this was not as painful so actually what it's actually caused that injury already has caused more bullying is cause of these things worse many of them feel rejected because we I don't have this and all my friends coming and they're getting all these texts and invitations this this it's immediate social mission media has it's actually infiltrated the minds and the brains of young people they just can't handle they can't cope with it yeah let's get out come for this this intense amount of information made much of the time is this it's negative and it's evil and it's it's it's not even encouraging I'm creeping they feel that down and then destitute despondent yeah brother said that these school shootings is it sure is not dummies out there but they're people that help they become despondent with school and they've been bullied and they've been dad and they take them you know and I'm gonna kill you know what you don't worry it's not the guns it's not the guns you say what you also it's not the gun I think what it is it's it's the damnedest things if they have watched 40 on television and movies and stuff like that killing and beaten and killing and murdering and for all these year they have seen it and watched it and see it and what what do you think it happened to the brains of these young people so brainwash with this television for all these years what do you think's in their mind yeah we say human beings are imitators yeah imitators if a baby if a baby was born to say babies born in America okay he's six months old okay you take that baby to Russia he lives in Russia for seven years he comes back to America yeah no no no word of English cozy and her English I had a person told me one time I was home guys you know take your children to church take him to church train him up in the way it looks it no I said I would never just like to make their own choices when they get to be 18 years old they can make the right choice that's a mom again chattering that they already do but yours I think they're they're born it's insane to me but it's time this Ross speaking hi they don't have a fighting chance to begin with but if you take them to church for 18 years they might at least have a chance to be same position those guys already taught me the devil didn't make that distinction for this giving me hope given television movies him video games give this fridge up there I'm the devil

gonna stop right there but you get the picture this respect the product respect the message respect the preacher respectable ministry to go home oh brother sister aren't you glad for the revelation of the word rain aren't you glad the revelation play something softly you know a lot exhortation if I don't take that ability there but I want that do you want to say this revelation brother man says all

know who the is the harlot daughters we never revelation 17 we know they say God has awarness - told us what they had what look for who the enemy is the deception he told us he say we have been this revelation it takes away all of the fear we're at case Barney oh we're getting ready to cross over are we gonna listen to we are more than able take the hand or we just did Giants up that we just can't take it wait report do you listen to brother for me in my house well serve the Lord we're going to take this message what the message you're saying we're going home let me just I'm going to give you just a little illustration revelation takes away fear I think you'll appreciate this when I was in the Air Force I always want to be a pilot there won't be a fighter pilot Vietnam so I didn't get to be a pilot really got to be crew members like I deflower c-130s c-130 big cargo plane so I got fined a few hours and you're flying cargo all over here and so I all of the hours that I flew on the c-130s improvement routine we got I got a pop in the flight mech with a pilot copilot navigated flight engineer so I was always on the headset and either take off the landing instructions but there was two times my flying career that I actually was skiers yes all the rest time I wasn't afraid I was on the headset there was instructions order one time we speech to make a landing and I was not on the headset at the time so I didn't know what the landing instructions were I want you to read between the lines down going home landing instructions so here we're off the coast of Spain is a little out and we're going to talk about some cargo with this allowed in the runway in that those islands over there they're just clips you know they've got a steep cliff you know 50-100 feet then just so happened that the runway span from this cliff to this cliff then once you run away little bitty small line okay so I didn't watch now you know for the pilot copilot but I think it landing instruction so I'm going sit out everyone come in flat fifty percent decrease in this thing landing gear down no more decent everything look good and I you know I just need a little bit more distance and I saw the runway or just the end of the runway as was coming in and he's over the landing at threshold he's little bit too fast but too high but he's gonna set it down I said he gonna be able make he'll make it so we're finished I was scared first time I've ever been scared well I knew he's gonna sit down I'm gonna be flying we're weeks weeks weeks I know set it down but he couldn't set it down because he'll stop click on the other hand she's just about to I realized he can't set it down he's making it right bacon pulled out I can look over my runaway boy was there was a shepherd on the runway about either 75 she made a low pass to run her sheep off the runway I said oh thank god [Applause] amen what a part of the message revelation takes away all of fear let's say the song wants to worship and just celebrate our victory over the devil really all the things God did when they were getting out of Egypt I was at a fair for that little place called cage for me how they fail that to such a vindication that God was with Moses but you know we're not gonna fail we believe the vindication never centerplex believe that it's no good for nothing but something deep in your soul makes the choice for Jesus Christ he is the spirit of Revelation learning listen that song to God be the glory [Music] [Music] with this [Music] till love on the seat we'll be seeing for a little minute some of the sisters left their detention just to prepare the meal some of them didn't get to come because they were preparing the food well that was a great feast I think what a surety we should have amen isn't it something that the direction of the people of God was taken out of the hands the supernatural and put into the minds of Tim spice plus pies and only two of them remember in that same joseline Caleb they did get their reward I'm glad I think sometimes work too fast as a society we fear the silent places but if it's a little Sun that's the time to be thinking where are we taking home with us we've gotta be in a boat our last land for this race we've got to just about be done we're seeing that people fall to the side and they're so close to the end had a few friends and some of the very people that brought me into this message for the Sanyo and after all these years still go back to the old Jewish feast days say a few words oh my such lovely people I'm going on something tells me the

praised and will have a word of Prayer for our food great [Music] [Music] god bless you that was a great effort you know brother tears went to the start procedure give anything that leave you preaches very smart it's a desperation and maybe you turn your stomach back into stepping stone for us by making it be strong to preach until he's done now all the ministry friends here in evangelist stay
