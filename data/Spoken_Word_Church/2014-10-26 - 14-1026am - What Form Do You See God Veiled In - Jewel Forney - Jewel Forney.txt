moving nature so we thank god for that just appreciate sam been a friend to us over the years and we really appreciate him and appreciate brother wade and appreciate i brought it the bride body here at this this in the uh and i told me i got up that morning it was coming by eating breakfast and they have some kind of meat i didn't want that stuff out since the sister dale had to run me she got him got me biscuits and gravy i would want that batch to look kind of dead after that i said man i ain't want nothing i didn't eat you know i said ain't gonna eat this stuff i said man i think i ruined this morning and i gotta hang around uh i like to start hanging around zach because actually he don't wanna get a good breakfast so when i come down i'm gonna be showing myself going amen so it's good to be here this morning uh i hadn't seen my son-in-law yet but uh trust god that he'd be saying make it on in so this morning we just want to go right to the word of god and you know my style they call me the helicopter preacher so when i get rid of land i'm just going to land so i'm just telling that right now said it was good to see brett daniel from new mexico and i didn't know he was there so that was a surprise and so his son-in-law he just got got another little baby since i've been boy and man that's all right man he really multiplying i was kind of nervous to shake his hand amen amen so we thank god for that this morning if you got your bibles this morning i'm gonna go to two places in the scripture romans eight and i'm gonna read from the book of philippians two but i wanna begin reading that romans eight and uh everybody this scripture probably don't been read more than any other scripture you can think of what i'm concerned in the bible romans 8 29 to verse 31 i believe it is and it says here for what he did for new he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers moreover when he did predestinate to them he also called and whom he called to them he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified him what shall we what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us i like this scripture right there to put the devil on the back burner already i mean so the next uh uh philippians 2 and i'm going to be starting at verse 5 philippians 2 verse 5. and let me find it myself it says here let this mind be in you which also was in christ jesus being uh who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the lightness amen that's a prayer father help me oh god to heal my mind my body my spirit my soul to you this morning god father god help me to catch the mind of christ for this assembly lord now father god i give you all my script lord i give you all my mind body soul and spirit will you please take over in the name of jesus christ we pray amen god bless you you may be seated one moment thank the lord for the reading of the word of god you see brother lewis amen thank the lord for the word of god this morning that we realize here that i like the way paul said it here he said another word of timothy uh of paul saying in philippians say being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god in other words either way paul was saying in the scripture he thought it not robbery to come to the same revelation that christ walked in hallelujah i had a title this morning i'm going to use this title what form do you see god veiled in it's very important that you know what form you're looking for right hallelujah that way some people say i'm looking for the form of the pillow fire i'm looking for the form of the car but i'm looking for the goddess skin hallelujah that's the form i want to see god in this hour i'm going to use the quotation from the mighty god unveil this is the form we're taking he's taking on his form he said now in ezekiel uh two and verse three he was there speaking to jehovah himself called called an ezekiel prophet son of man did he say son of man means a this is the message the mighty god unveiled page eight he said son of man means a prophet he has to come that way see the people trying to make it come some other way but that is the only interest he got into this life in florida he had to come through a prophet hallelujah if he chained the pattern he break the scripture and he said he has to come that way to do to fulfill due to romans 18 and verse 15 which moses said the lord your god shall raise up raise up among you a prophet like it unto me he never he never called himself the son of god he referred to himself son of man because he had to come according to the scripture i did not according to a human will but according to the scripture if god do something this morning he's still got to come according to the scripture he will never change his coming outside the scripture and he says and see he he has to make himself known those two pieces of uh uh uh those two pieces of torn paper the old testament has had to make those two pieces uh and why i'm ready back read the same thing excuse me yeah the old testament prophecy his own and then we're dealing with his own he pulled it up praise god and he's dealing with his own character to to to be exactly the same so he has he come the son of man it come in that form hallelujah that was the form that god has failed him now i want you to notice here as i begin to look at the word of god as i take this code off one thing i believe boy you can't work and fight with a codom so thank god for that and otherwise it comes in the form of the son of man and the point of it is so we feel like if god comes in a prophet he always got to come that way right right hello bego god can surely do nothing except he revealed himself that way that is scripture for his coming so now we find him we find here that we want to look at him as he begin to come up begin to be paralyzed himself into the form of a man but he had to come to a prophet first hallelujah we find here that i began i took isaiah 61 and then he began to isaiah was a prophet hallelujah and it would israel got the inspiration of god thought in his mind and i thought the word had to be a thought before it could be made flesh i dare say ain't underwear and underwear he began to prophesy a virgin secrecy how did he begin to speak the word of god and did we find here in isaiah 61 he began to tend to that word be made flesh let's look at isaiah 61. isaiah 61 verse 1 i like the way jesus said here what the word god come here he was here here with this prophecy was here and it been it been as they were speaking these things under inspiration son of man he catches the mind of god and he began to speak the word hallelujah in the word so here he was he'd say and when he was speaking that inspiration was on him and it seemed like he was talking about himself but he was clear he was speaking the word of god and god would materialize himself around flesh he says here the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tiding unto the meat he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captain and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of revenge of our god today to comfort all that moan so i love speaking these words under inspiration but as long as it was right there under the heart and lord that word was right there and it never did nothing never took or never came to pass it was no good it was just been laying down but it had to come to pass and if god spoke it he had to come and fulfill it so whenever released the word god had to materialize himself around that promise hallelujah so we found her and we noticed the story here in the world how did he always come through how he always come through prophecy hallelujah that is this coming how did isaiah i knew he had to come to the fulfillment of that prophecy because the prophet said club modern evictions made clear by prophecy so modern events is made clear about prophecy he had to come according to prophecy so he wouldn't materialize himself and one day a virgin she had to step into prophecy mary was not it was no accident that mary went down to the well there was no accident hey what she was doing that morning it was according to prophecy she had to be the one it could nobody even fulfill her place nobody could take your place how do god know who he is they know where you come from and nobody can take your place how did so mary had to be the she had to be the virgin i know a lot of times we don't find over the years people get worked up in their minds and now they'll come up and they'll say a statement like this i got pregnant and i didn't know no man if they tell you that they automatically tell you a lot right they tell you a lot that ain't going to happen but once that ain't going to happen but one time ain't now nothing tell me that what happened since that time right hallelujah a little worse if that didn't work we cannot believe a lie like that i don't care how much they speaking to us how holy look underworld anymore one man come that way and that was the man christ jesus however another man could have come that way then it could have been another land worthy to take the book but it wasn't but one man that was worthy to take the book and that was the man that come without sex desire how do you know a man that come by the spoken word prophecy of the word that's right hello so mary came down that morning how did mary identify him she you know what she might not have realized but she was standing in isaiah prophecy right mary was walking in isaiah privacy a verdict she could see hallelujah she would have knew her plan she couldn't say this day isaiah prophecy fulfilled how did she was standing in the prophecy for that hour and all of a sudden she had to believe it see the point of it is today is getting people to believe how do you know to get the people to believe america just was going to be uh operated by faith hallelujah in other words another word anyway we always talk about the evidence of the holy ghost and won't believe a promise holy everywhere the very evidence of the holy ghost feed off the promises hallelujah show the evidence of the holy ghost and the word did the prophet god use the message in the future on page 26 and he began to talk about the evidence said the holy ghost mary had to come to a clear understanding of what she was doing god don't never take us by surprise about accident we got a clear understanding where we come from we got a clear understanding where we're going from how to go until we realize if we got a clear understanding if i'm coming from god i'm going back to god holy ain't no devil hell to stop your destiny holy should he go down here he uses the quotation in the future he said now what we what what we are talking and tell talking the other day the evidence of the lord he goes see the evidence of the holy ghost is when you can receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding how do you know that word is a clear understanding clear understanding it watch it vindicate itself then you know you are in the scripture and once you see the word come to pass you see your position in the scripture people don't want to tell you right now until you meet that word made flesh until it becomes anywhere this word can not just see you you just not should never walk around all your life with a book in your hand that ain't gonna do you no good when you fight the devil you gotta get the book in your heart so when you speak the word you become a little voice to mary here she's come here she became that prophecy anyway she met she stepped in isaiah prophecy holly what did she do she had to have a clear understanding she could not be in the spirit of confusion because the holy ghost is not a confusion there's a presence of almighty god breaking in on mary like that it throwed her into whoa man would you explain it never happened before here she was standing there a the man a gabriel standing there with a message from the king holly mary mary you have been highly favored hallelujah you have been highly favorable among women hallelujah mary and you shall receive a son and born of the holy ghost mary thank you be there oh my lord wait a minute holy holy holy we don't get ahead of the program i ain't got married yet and i don't even know a man hallelujah so she put it back on human ability to produce a child she put it about the way human but reproduction to bring forth a child she said i don't even know a man that she knew that was a that was the logical that was the way that life comes but god said no mary not just time this is the seal's been opened this ain't got nothing to do with man hollywood they tell mary hit mary said i don't understand it then he had to go and break a seal right right he goes way back and he goes say mary i see right now you're not catching what i'm saying you remember the last time you died cousin elizabeth she was all humped over and uncle and uncle and unconscious how they were walking around that brother could get around hallelujah couldn't hardly get to the anyway that's what mary would remember she remember looking at a cousin a little bit and uh because of zachariah how they were getting old in the old days but he said mary i want to let you know right now he said oh god tell you an elizabeth in her old lady have already received a baby how do we marry cena see that ain't nothing too hard for god it ain't meant to hurt your fault of god if god could bring a baby out of elizabeth holy how much more being under me according to that word god she brought through prophecy hallelujah john had to be on earth before jesus could come because the prophet had always forerunned the word so you cannot break the order of the scripture how little john had you know where the bible said john and she had carried this baby she had had this baby in her womb six months i think it was and had no revival right hallelujah there was no thunder to wake john up hallelujah another way you could have the first sixth seal and not be in the revelation of the word i'll leave the first six seals and not him himself but when she everywhere so she had not had a revival and since it's six churches but mary came yeah how did it carry the world of life and when she greeted jim a little boy and spoke his name and whatever she done john leaped in her womb for joy when it was the word spoke life the word bring life and life was in the body she was carrying the word of life in her body and she said jesus and every devil in hell know their name so now jesus we find him he'll go prophecy now we we were dealing with prophecy this morning so jesus had to find himself he had to find himself it was good to say he was the messiah but it was another thing to find himself in the scripture now we find a lot of history it didn't record a lot of things in his life we had a few events that it took place when he was younger one was he was in the temple teaching when he was 12 years old how did we remember that and then and we remember a couple of little things that happened in his in his life when he was you went real small it does not really say a lot about jesus life when he was uh when he was small only on the referee we got on a few things that he did when brother peregrine goes down in egypt and pulls up the old manuscripts and one of the manuscripts was telling about jesus when he was a baby hallelujah another word that because he was dealing with when mary you remember when he goes into the wedding the wedding fish mary told those disciples whatever he tell you you just do it honey don't you try to question it just do it right why mary had to have an experience that this son had power and he was supernatural so you know so she goes here and i was looking at brother read a manuscript years ago and it really hit me mary in other words if he said he said what happened was the reason mary faith was built to the way it was when jesus was a little bitty baby holly mary was sitting on some corner somewhere and she had a bucket of water uh uh uh either a pan or water whatever and she was washing jesus and she was cleaning him up i didn't know the old man sitting there with a wizard on him and so when mary got through washing jesus she slid the bucket over there and this man sitting at the wizard oh he reached down and touched the water and his hand grew out straight mary said that got to be a god man why didn't we tell you you just do it right holy i want to tell you this morning why don't we tell you just do it don't question god don't question faith he said it he promised it and he'll stand behind it to be valuable though jesus must identify himself it was time for prophecy to be fulfilled the word had to be in flesh hallelujah ordered to take this part of the book so now he ought to fulfill the port concerning himself how what do we do he goes in here to the book of saint luke say luke the saint luke the fourth chapter and i want to begin at the verse 18 just the same time say luke the fourth chapter and verse 18 2 21 here he goes he goes until we know the story goes into the temple and that way and they handed him a scroll and what jesus began to say he began to take the scripture he began to say i am standing in isaiah prophecy nobody was trying to let the people i am standing in isaiah prophecy hallelujah so he said now if you notice here he was going back to something being preached 800 years ago he was if modern event was made clear the word and the body becoming one he says here the spirit of the lord is upon me i was the greatest anointing that would hit the earth right how did the greatest anointing hit the earth you said well that's shouting and running out no the greatest anointing has been able to find yourself in the word because you find people that just shout run holly shout all over the building but they don't know their position in the world and when the storms come and the trials come they move off and run their faith how do they leave the church where they do they don't know their position right hallelujah he said the spirit of the lord god is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel not only him every preacher that's called by the holy ghost is under the same covenant you got to be anointed by him to preach the gospel hallelujah that's the only way you could be hallelujah gospel don't come by intellectual training how did we got many preachers that went to school and became intellectual teachers of the scripture and what do they teach the people they don't teach the people to get closer to god they teach them away from god because you got to be anointed by god to preach the word says he says here he says he'd have anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and the recovering of sight to them to the blind to set it liberally to them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord this way he was he now it's something taking place here because when you start to read a scripture i read the whole scripture when i read isaiah 61 i didn't stop right there in the second verse and just stop i read the whole thing out when jesus got to this point he stopped right in the right before he completed the second verse and it though the people because when somebody do this you think why didn't finish everybody look at him while he didn't finish the scripture he did finish the scripture he fulfilled the part that was concerning him in prophecy he was no need to read the rest of it that was not his part right hallelujah he was playing at the sympathy right so he didn't end the word then they closed in the book he closed the book right there i knew he was the one that could close and open it so he called the book right there and then he the bible said and then him and when he closed the book he gave it again to the ministers and he sat down and the eyes of all them were in the synagogue were fastened on him right they were sitting in a in a state of what did he why he didn't finish reading this why he called the book and just give it back he didn't even read the rest of it how did he read the part that was concerning him then he goes in here to every eye was up on him in the synagogue and then then he sat down and he and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears i mean what was he talking to he was talking to the sheep right i wanted to seek your heart certainly don't have ears so he was speaking to all the elections right there how did this day this scripture it fulfilled in your ear he was talking to the legacy blessing all your ears all right for we know the time that we live in prophecy holy we fire so he always take the prophecy concerning him and we noticed right here and we noticed it here we go he knew what jesus life was built around prophecy his death he went to hell on a prophecy of one man they committed adultery now you know we're going to go to hell you're going to die you want to make sure you got a man that you don't got nothing in his life but jesus was not looking at his body he was looking at the soul that was in david because david said lord i hear that word in my heart that i don't sin against you my body might have made a mistake but i didn't do it in the first place i didn't know what he was looking at anyway he was looking at the prophecy he was looking at the position he called david and david stepped in the spirit of prophecy and he prophesied anyway hey look at my i didn't know where my balls in my and he began to promise about his bones and how did he another way he began to speak of death and jesus what the hell a one-man prophecy amen david prophesied how death would be right and jesus took that scripture along and he went down and faced satan with him on one man prophecy but by one man prophecy it brought his body out of the grave one man probably put him in the grave one man prophecy brought him out of the grave and that what job said hallelujah don't he scared word destroy my flesh but in my flood i shall see jesus he recognized his body he's seen the resurrection one man probably put him in the grain and one man probably brought him out of the grave that's why he's standing on myself tonight this morning hallelujah prophecy find him we find that these other guys coming from the book of emails the reason they was confused confusion is when you don't know your place in the scripture hallelujah in other words i know i know we in with the message here but brother brandon said i preach the bible and then when people trying to try and approve a quote without the bible it don't work brother brandon proved to quote his bible wasn't his absolute how do you know what he said if i say something the bible doesn't go back to the word right i'll leave it under the word so you know where anyway so we realized that the brother brother had a respect for god's word and proven paul had a respect for the word how do we everyone shall we begin to go in here and we find here that from the road emails so guys was not in prophecy they was in the flesh and it was you know because it was in the flesh all they could see was the death all they had to look at job they would saw the resurrection how they were they were looking at the death where they everybody was where and they were they were looking at the devil here and here they were going down the road they was all sad and they were beat down and they all they was all on the depression here they were going down here why was he while they were oh my god my how they doing to my lord all they could see was hallelujah jesus good and the bible said what it was he steps out in a glorified body how to a young body 18 years old or 20 years old that they never had contact with right right amen it's all right to remember brother sam you know it's good you can remember brother sam hallelujah you know you and and and you know in our minds here we wouldn't have a picture and never saw him when he was a young boy we just look at him i remember brother sam that is the way you're going to see brother sam hallelujah because that's all you ever saw him you saw him in that body his older guys however's gray and everything and that's where you remember brother sam and then you see him that way that's the way you're going to look and that's the way he's in your mind that was the seed had been planted in your mind that brother said but if i turn if i never saw brother sam as a young man and he looked like brother zach yeah yeah so then now when i see if he'd come out of his brother's eye i wouldn't be able to look at him and tell if this brother sam or not because now he's in a young body and when anyway when he stepped out in this body they could not recognize the body because you don't accept christ by sight you're accepted by faith they come by hearing the word the word of prophecy is what opened the eyes hallelujah so he goes out here he steps into this dimension stepping into the body not into a theology this is a body that you can touch a body that you can feel he didn't go down to he didn't go when he come back up he out of the out of the tomb he didn't leave the body in the grave he picked that body up chained the elements like he did in the day of abraham and walked out right and he walked down the road with him and he began to quote scripture to him because he was concerned and if you don't know the scripture you won't know what i'm here for how so he if you notice he goes back to the scripture starting with the man's seed moses he says here old food the flow of heart that believe all that the prophets had said right concerning me because he realized the prophecy was coming through prophets so you're pointing him back if you would have stayed with the prophets you would have knew what i'm here to do you would have been in the scripture anyway did he begin to rebuke because they didn't stay with what the prophet was saying they began to try to take their seminary idea or something what somebody else said oh it don't matter what nobody else said they're gonna be a revelation according to the word of god i don't care how many churches don't believe that but i believe in the changing of the body he's the old food slow of heart then he texts the scriptures concerning himself and revealed himself to them right and then here they would it was all whoa whoa we never hear nobody open the word like that hallelujah ain't never heard nobody do this the bible says here there's a little flame probably flicking in their heart at evening time the evening time the cheap meal of the day this was not breakfast to a degree yeah i don't like eggs i i eat eggs i ain't say i didn't eat egg i say i don't like eggs i like eggs revealed chicken why are you eating liquid when you can have it revealed yeah right hallelujah so it doesn't work so you know here he was here they was at the cheap meal of the day it was not a time to eat ham and and and eat eggs and and eat some hash brown this is evening meal right this is where you get the tater salad yeah holly the pork chops chicken if you sold brother hog chilis you gonna sit down and eat like that but that's when you get ugly hallelujah breakfast you you still eating modest but when time to eat down and you get ugly you can't eat being pretty right you cannot eat being pretty you just gotta get ugly how do you if you got a big old barbecue rim you can't sit there with a big barbecue ribs all right now you just you might roll your sleeves up put your apron on and get ugly holly that's the only way you're gonna enjoy the ribs one time i was eating a i went out with a family and they were they kept me to a place you eat lobsters or not lobsters or crabs crab legs and uh and their words and here they were they brought a big plate of crab leg and i'm sitting there thinking trying to keep it and this girl looked at me she was eating she said what you could eat like a sis and eat like a man she gave me a complex i said i can't believe this girl just rebuked me won't you eat like a man to quit eating like a how did he say that i told my the cheat meal the other day they called jesus in at the chief at the evening time and that's when he brought he goes into the place with them in the chief mail and it says here he goes this guest this is our guest normally when you have a guest the most hospitable thing to do is have him to either bless the table you know he always normally guess get uh you know you got to guess that i know what you people thinking every time i'm preaching can we get to eat first back mama but gibbs told me that when they was young the preachers got to eat first they got all the good chicken and got the chicken feet the kids got the chicken feet i said man don't give me no chicken feet that's the only thing i don't eat on chicken and feeds too many other parts you can eat outside the feast hallelujah anyway he said but you know but here they were they gave jesus the guest on break the bread jesus knew this was going to open the eyes because this was probably they're going to remember something that he always done something that they seen him do time at the time at the time he broke the bread a certain way he could break the bread he kept giving it out and he kept giving it out and they noticed the bread was not consumed how then they began to realize oh no their eyes come open and they knew him but it was not important that they knew him it was important that they know their place in the scripture hey jesus did not leave him now with the eyes open looking at him he opened the eyes to the scripture because he know after he leaves they got to be in the word to find their place god bless you brother just stop there praise the lord we're dealing with a heaven amen sorry i'm dealing with a little break on what form do we see god failed in dealing with prophecy so now we fight here so jesus said we find that jesus did anything and he made himself known by prophecy he never changed his pattern and that's the way he got why he left him with the scripture if you notice he said he opened their eyes they knew him and then he realized okay this anyone left them in that point all they would have stayed right there in that spot right but he opened their understanding that they may understand the scripture because he know after his resurrection after he'd be sent back he gonna pick up the same order that he gave moses the lord him god should do nothing right he would never change that order right now that were the people that misguided he don't never change that order the lord your god would raise up a prophet liking unto me so now let us get here i'm going to deal this in him because now we realize here so he leaves he sends back his spirit according to the prophecy of joel that was prophecy that was not no accident that people got excited like that how this shoots the scene since the screen revival was only the prophecy how i poured my spirit right on your sons and your daughters and they shall prophesy it it had to come to pass they were standing in prophecy when this took place in other words so we remember god when he did this uh outpouring of the spirit right here they maybe people begin to to get called up and seeing them the power of god moving through the church prophecies taking place things taken place people's getting heavy speaking in tongues that was good that was his day but it was bringing us to something it was bringing into something because he was it had to be according to the scripture for us to understand what we ain't it had to be a prophecy because that was dave's mistress jesus never opened the last boy he said i didn't preach the you know the claim the liberty and you know and all that he never preached that part so something still was sealed because he closed the book he didn't say nothing about it so that was something else to come healthy so we we're standing in prophecy so now it goes all the way over here so we got we we must find our day and time now all of a sudden according to prophecy you know he said a grain of wheat must go into the ground a greater we had to fall into the ground that great rail fell into the ground but if it lay if it don't go into the ground it abides alone holy that won't be no revival but if it go into the ground and pray for many fruits one corn on the day of pentagon brought the three thousand believers what are they doing that corn is beginning to bring more corn how they sure he had to go in the ground so he went in the ground through the darkness of justification where's the saints forget on up to come on to our day all right and that they did at the evening time before they do what they're going to go back into the grain again i'm back into the seed again holy what is the seeds how it's time to go to the rapture right right how did prophecy have put us all the way through history until the coming of the lord and rapture form right people if you're looking for something else to happen you don't miss the whole real revelation what he come to do revelation couldn't do not you just come to stir it jesus why are you standing here again there ain't no prayer you better be looking at it downhill you better be looking at now you don't need to be looking up for him to come you better be looking in here on the inside now so i'm going to deal with so here you go he goes down so now we see all the events taking place by prophecy okay he coming up through the edges so now he got he got to manifest himself again in prophetic form hallelujah according to prophecy amen three and seven surely the lord that god would do nothing except he revealed his secrets to the servants of the prophet according to malachi 4 he would come after the order he if you go back to malachi 4 if you notice in malachi 4 he takes them back and he opened the understanding to what he opened his understanding and his first coming all right let's go to malachi 4. right yeah malachi the fourth chapter people don't want to tell you this this did not come has come by the open holy ghost hallelujah you say brother jewel you say how you know i've seen it by the holy ghost right not by mental conception but by what god revealed hallelujah i want you to notice here when jesus come out of the resurrection if you notice his brother and he brought your brother as soon as he come out and stepped out of the glorified bloody on the way to emmaus he says he goes back and he says he take those fools and slow hard to remember all that the prophet said did he take the scripture concerning moses and begin to bring it up right so when he goes right here and then where he goes into malachi malachi the fourth chapter let me try to say what verse i'm trying to get to hallelujah let me find my place in here and and in verse four malachi the fourth chapter wait a minute yeah verse four and it says here if you notice right here what did he do he goes and do the same thing right he did when he come out of the grave holly on the road ebayers he's a remember who yeah he goes back probably because it's the resurrection of his second coming of christ he's taking on the same voice that he had there remember the laws of moses my word and and i command him in what hearing what the word is it for all israel with the statues of judgment so then i didn't go he takes the scripture and he fulfilling what he left off right how did he go with the day of revenge he never preached but when he take this scripture it goes right into the judgment right hallelujah did he say behold hallelujah did he go right to the prophet behold i was saying unto you elijah not son of god right right but son of man he's coming back in prophetic form again elijah shall we send unto you elijah the prophet before the coming and great and dreadful day of the lord hallelujah and he shall turn the horse of the fathers to the churches hallelujah and the churches to to their father lest i come and smack the earth with a curse what are you doing he's going he's undoing what even adam had already done when they when they fell when he even had them failed for adam's sake the ground was current but i'm coming to turn him back if i don't either holly the car's got to be left that's why we got to go back to restored eating right how so we're right there so now we find her the question i'm trying to get to this is the question is why is the people falling away now why all of a sudden it's been a great falling away from all this truth lord your jew what can we do to stop it nothing but trust that you got the holy ghost you better know that you got the holy ghost hallelujah that's what you're blaming your revelation is today hallelujah if you ain't got the holy ghost why because this is the edge we've seen all this falling away not only do we see falling away we fire that peoples have been blinded go out west yeah yeah i wish and uh brother ben you believe the message that's right i ain't going to go that far i know and brother daniel believed the message but i'm talking about i don't been to arizona or one-third of the arizona area believes in brother brandon gonna come back set up a tent and get an airplane the airplane is so out of date and why would he need a tent when jesus come in he'll go cholesterol glory five bodies he didn't need a tent he just stepped right through the door hallelujah he didn't need a tent to get away going when philip got so called up he didn't need a tent he didn't translate him over there jeremy why would he need a tip well people get but the point of it is prophecy that's right bro they won't even need an airplane harley we won't need our plane to get off the earth hallelujah won't be able to hold the third pool harley has the same mission in the caterpillar lays in you right how do the more you eat that word the more you terrorize the body around that seed but look here five people was mixed up my brother brandon become god because they could not discern the prophecy from the prophet right hallelujah they said that's it anyway you remember john come on the earth that says they bowed to him oh you're the messiah they wanted to worship him but john did not get him to look at him he put him in prophecy i am the voice of one crime in the wilderness he pointed them back outside he knew what his position was in the world and the people that they got caught up in these spirits that said we need to pray for them because they ain't not found themselves they're looking at the prophet said of the prophecy so they got the revelation mixed up they looking for brother brandon come back and do something when they should be looking at prophecy is already doing it hallelujah show your deals he goes on here and let me go to revelation 10. i'm going to get to something then i'm going to parachute and give me about you know my way i am so when i get ready to jump it's going to be fast i got to jump forward enough i don't get caught up in the capellas somebody said hey paris you know the helicopter i ain't figuring that out i said but i do know one thing i got to jump forward no when i release it i don't get caught up in the repellents at least so so that is uh a revelation revelation uh 19 starting at verse 7 he must knew where i was going he went right to it revelation 9 revelation 19 excuse me revelation 19 verse 7 but that's a good one too and there were that deadly that malachi 4 and this linked all together but revelation yeah let's go this one see now i want you to notice this is another revival taking place how did something else take a place in prophecy how did jesus come the first time here they were going down the road hallelujah and then what wildzy wifey oh boy but right here right something to take place right here all right we're not going around the road why don't we wow hallelujah it's time to go home hallelujah we're excited why we know who we are now everybody man he said let us be glad glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come right not right because see bride don't go all the way bride ain't no strong enough word to fulfill the scripture you know when a guy get engaged to a girl he become her future bridegroom she become his spiritual bride and when under this bride administration he don't want to get to go to the kitchen in the living room that's where he goes right i mean long as she says bro he has no right to exercise any authority outside of going to the kitchen he get to eat the seven course meal hallelujah you know how little bit he probably said man i hope she can cook like a mama but that's good hallelujah you can eat the seven course meal in the in the kitchen uh that's under bride but i want you to know bride is not a strong enough word for because jesus would not repregnant a bride he didn't come to pray nate o'brien he got to pray that a wife a wife got benefits that a bride don't god she knows her mate now you know when the bride you know she gets the little goofy letters i know what he's going to be like when i'm here holy cow he had to be here i tell you what's wrong with my daughters they don't lost their minds they have lost their mind they have been called up in the mystery of love and then once you get caught up in the love of god you get wow you know where they're going to the house and they've happened in the house that had never happened before ice cream in the microwave all kinds of stuff going on and i go in there and i tried that a couple of them got one guy gage one year they next year so everything's right in the same cycle so they didn't give me time to recruit guys have got a lot of daughters i feel for you i do man you're gonna see some dumb stuff in yours to come yes sir you'll see some dumb stuff adrina jr was my secretary she did real good she kept her with all my appointments brother sam anybody call my daddy is she gonna look at him my daddy won't not be able to do that for you brother sam he i see right here on here on this date she kept up but once she got in love got engaged she come in the room daddy brother sam call when he go i think he's two weeks ago two weeks ago i don't know what happened to him he went out the door when he'd come in that would happen when he'd come in your mind go out the door hallelujah let me see her let her be glad hallelujah and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb and scoff not bride his wife to change administration now i need to change your position his wife had made herself ready and to and to her was granted she should be shall be a rey and fine line and clean and white for the finally is the righteousness of the side you say that's my right no you ain't got no righteousness you ain't got no righteousness your righteousness as a filthy ragged gossip only when you have righteous you got to come to him he got to come to you it's got to be through his blood not through the whole through the blood all right then he says here that's why he could not preach the seals until he preached a breach right because see if he would have preached the seals before he preached a breach of righteousness would not be holy enough to go behind the veil but right before he preached the seals he preached a breach and the breach brought bleach and what he did he gave you wash you it cleared it up so we could go into the king james i did what he ain't out we are in the chamber now hallelujah right and he said unto me right amen bless us all day let's see can you click that up i'm going down to 10 yeah i think he said blessed all day which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb he said unto me these are the true sins of god so now the spirit a deity always following the revival spirit of guilty always try to follow man so there's a daily spirit that's going to be so close in this message that you're going to have to take god's spirit and discern that spirit highly or else you could be peeled up because you're gonna begin to look at the vessel and then people begin to look at the vessel and then finally they realize the vessel is a man and they think you know they leave the message right so he goes here he's out fell in his feet to worship him true prophet will never accept worship right true preacher man of god will never accept worship he will never point you to himself he will always point you to the cross he will always point you to the blood and when a man begins to say look at you look at himself remember that is a wrong spirit that is antichrist exactly because god would not share his glory so he said read another word you don't come to church and you say well brother sam he got many mistakes so do you when he gets a new body then he won't have no mistakes but up until then we all got to deal with mistakes so he says here he said and i fell in his feet to worship him and he said unto me say do it not right that was a revelation that hour right that was a revelation that ever paul said no if not i died for you it was not paul's die for you it was christ he always kept him in position with the cross he said if any angel changes let it be a curse even we ourself right we leave this position in the world let us be a curse exactly right hallelujah and he said he said do it not for for i am that fellow servant wanted that brother to have the testimony right of of jesus worship exactly the object of worship no other person you can worship with god how do you worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of what how do you show the only way you could ever see god only way you could see god and through the spirit of what hallelujah so he put us back now we know our position right now that's why we can find what day we living in without knowing prophecy you would not know the day you lived in so the prophet used a scripture i'll use the scripture real quick when you go and preach a certain message he preached it in the message invisible union let me show you how he started this message all so he goes in the invisible unit he's going to preach so he goes with and he starts it off with prophecy right he goes and he says invisible union page 5 and he says now in romans 7 i trust that you have your bibles open everywhere across the country anyway he realized this was so important right we want to read closely now just smash it out of here it seems like his own marriage and divorce what was he doing why did he go back because marriage and divorce was original sin that fell in the garden so all therefore they ever get straightened out we had no opposition what happened why we got to go back and go back to eden because that's where we fell from so he gets through message marriage and divorce romans seven right he said to me it seems like his own marriage in the boy but he was saying i'm going back and i'm picking up everything that adam lost hallelujah going back now through this man i got to pick up everything that adam lost all right glory he'll marry a new voice he's a but i realize to me it is prophecy right right to the to for the church in the last days let us read then he go say no you're not didn't go to the bro he said no not brother for i speak to to them that know the law how that the law has have dominion over a man as long as he lives hallelujah indeed he goes right to the church he's sure the woman must have another word and the way all over the husband lives she's under that law he goes into these things right here i'm not going to get mad before don't get nervous what was he doing why did he go to that because now he he's dealing with something in the beginning that woman fell from which was the type of the church what did he fall for she fell from the position of the word right and adam fell to the position of the wife which become perverted boy it's a powerful scripture let me let me just deal with this real quick believe me people don't caught up in this thing right now so when adam fell he fell from the position by listening to his wife in other words he was the one and he was co-equal with adam as long as she say submission to his shield you submission to the word and lord you stay submission to your pastor right right in the word that the way they probably put it as long as he stays with the word you have no right you have no right you have no right to if he's preaching you the word you have no right to challenge him in any way or try to turn him anyway ain't that true bro that one we got two he's a two spirits that dominate the church two spirits what would they be jezebel ism and and bayleism right a nicoletta listen brother try to control one control the church one controller the pastor but the point over there we need the control of the word so now what did that do adam failed in other words so this is what he goes and picks up romans seven how do what he do straighten out without him done done right yeah right and then and and in genesis 3 verse verse uh 17 it says here and he said it in adam because god has talked unto the voice of thy wife that's genesis 3 17 because god has hearkened to the voice of thy wife in other words there's some other voice there but one voice hallelujah your name but one voice in the day of the voice of the seven angel it was not voices if there's another voice there there's an unclean spirit working in the church hallelujah then he says here he says here i want you to notice right here it was one voice here he said he said it right here in verse 17. and under adam he said because i have heard that to the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree which i command thee saying thy shall not eat of it the voice of god say don't do it right step on the e say we can do it that's what the church tells the people today you're gonna have to live like this they're just taking it too far you can make the rapture god don't mind if you drink a little bit you think that yourself in the frying pan here we are amen so that adam's done this now remember adam in a position that god could not curse adam and remain god because of every soul of god was god so god would have cursed out he would have to put a crush on his own self right and he said it in his own word he said curse it is the ground right for our sake right so he bypass the soul it cuts the ground right why because say they gonna get his hand on the book of life right the lamb's looking like and when he was gonna go get his head on the soul of adam he would have perverted he had to go back to his redeemer hallelujah he said what did he do he said the book that he went back to the kids from a redeemer i knew god knew that adam wouldn't be lost right right how do sure he says here he's said because it'd be graffiti i say and solve i eat of it all the days of thy life those that this one shall he bring forth to thee and i shall eat does he eat the herd of the field did he say if he went on here let me go yeah that's good and right 19 yeah and then the sweat right anybody here don't sweat if you don't sweat you did because sweaters are fulfilling a prophecy of a curse it had to happen now everybody know right now i'm not dead sweat is a fulfillment of prophecy you know what what does it mean i'm perfect i said do you sweat well yeah i said you ain't perfect because they didn't sweat you just happened hallelujah this was a sign that you died every time you sweat every time you sweat preaching this way every day your pastor get up and he give labor brought away get up here and label and sweat coming in that's a sign they give in their life right that's the sign you swear you're giving that life that while you get through sweat and you're warm and you're tired you've got to replenish yourself with drinking water and trying to get food why because your body's giving out life right how do you say in the other word he's in the sweat of our face that should eat bread until i returned unto the ground for out of it was not taken for dust thou are and unto dust shall i return right so what did he do he cursed the earth he gave satan permission to put sickness on your body but not your soul told job you could touch everything but you can't touch your soul you could take all you got but you can't touch the why satan had dominion for the body right but he never had dementia oh joe's soul what did he do when satan got this element of of power in the earth the earth was cursed somebody shed in the blood had not only redeemed man same plan of redemption deemed the earth by and the man's he used the same place why i got to earth that's what we're in and you might thank you as good as you was when you was 20 years old and if you think you ain't good enough you can buy your holiday and grow your ponytail it won't work you get up to 120 all your hair blow out i mean just that way you know we i know we all we and you know old man's field you know every time we get filming i'm pretty good yeah i remember one time i mean my son was in a weight room i walked over there to a bench i probably at that time i might have been 40 46 maybe i walked up there until he had 250 pounds on i said let me show this boy what kind of dead what kind of man he got for a dad i got that on that bench three times i got up and i stuck my chest out i looked at my boy i said you see that son he got down there he said and i looked at my ain't going to show you everything i know this curses on this body why because once satan got the plan to the earth he was able to produce thorns and thistles which is now in to be burned right they're going to be rejected and burned right so now we go back to your prophecy now this is what it is this prophecy the curse of the earth is on our bodies this is what we our soul been redeemed back but we got to go back and get a redeemed body then we go back to the redeem earth holy so now the plan of a deal why we gotta read why we in the shape we i had to read what reader died just said he goes right here he's a reader he's a reader that just here not long ago where young girls are going through menopause and means the change of life between 20 and 25 years old the change of oh man this guy y'all thanks man what a hit my ass i'm glad i thank god for science too he just says go ahead younger going through the menopause between the change of life between 20 and 25 years old they are they are going through the middle edge now you know that that right there and that's some people's habits some people's uh some people this is uh it probably know that causal just right here is going to do this especially this other generation now we know uh the brother just had a baby we know he's not going to do none of this so he didn't pass 25 he told me he was 38 years old so here we are so he goes there so the dirty corruption why because of science research of food the only weapon that satan had we love food man didn't think years ago you could eat a biscuit and run all day you eat a biscuit two hours later i'm hungry satan's science has begun satan has been walking to tear down his body and when he get the body we he eventually goes to the brain and he weakens not only the body the brain and the body so he goes and he starts working to death why because science and research and food that have broken down have broke down from the natural thing we should put in our what that why we have to take vitals it ain't nothing natural but all the stuff ain't natural that's the good stuff you know you get a hamburger you know you're dying but you're dying happy i mean you're my way to believe you know when you're saying y'all shouldn't be eating this hamburger and you think but man that joker looks so good we are we have nothing but a bunch of mush of dying corruption now that's what the church is also in the it's the same what right he goes he goes in the way there he goes right there if you notice he's taking this and he goes back to the fall in the garden and he put the church on the same level right right right what did he do what we eat hallelujah what we eat so the revelation is what are you gonna restore it fell from eating the word if you notice in the prophecy in the beginning adam fell from eating he failed to eat the word to live forever so if the church fell from eating the word how he must restore it back right by eat it just take the book by probably and eat the book what it's going to turn your body back like it was in the beginning we need to put the right things back in our body and the only thing that can change your body is the word i could go on and on but i'm going to get red prop i got my parachute on something i'll leave something to say this because i see it today now i'm going to get the following away real quick that's the one i want to close on falling away why are so many people falling away brother brandon goes in and he takes another quote and he begin to speak on this going yeah this is it he they paid nor but not paid 11. he said let me prophesy something to you let me prophesy not just go and say a word right not just say a word because it'll be different where you can say well that's his opinion but if his prophecy didn't mean that he just spoke it then we got to wait till the event made clear so now he let me prophesy something to you just before it comes to pass so that make it prophecy he's speaking it man i clear this guy good man that's all right let me find what paragraph is that but huh 82. hell yeah that's why bartima that's all right you know tell brothers tell brother sam you are resigning your job and you're going to be traveling with me for now amen okay okay and i need your boy man i wouldn't have never wear my glasses he said let him prophesy something to you before it come to pass the whole world is groping in what right and we'll get worser and worser and worser until they become a bunch of the writers and it's almost that way right right that was prophecy that now that is history that what we just read is no longer prophecy we have seen it got worser and worser and worser until they become a bunch of neurotics people they got no natural affection for life you'll get more time today for killing a man dog you killing the owner so what we gonna do about this is know we can do about it to fall in the way coming people are falling away the minds is breaking down why because in the natural their bodies is breaking people's bodies weak today everywhere you go there's a pharmacy every corner when i was a boy you never i didn't even we had one drugstore in the town central dun dun right in the town you get sick that's where you went but the day i got a book i got to go in and find out which one i want to go to you got ride a's you got cbs you got this over here and this they all over there why did they show you their society and the coming of the lord that our bodies is materializing and breaking down so when the body we tell light and break down what do the people turn to what do people turn to they turn to sorcery that's what some pharmacy means they turn back to sorcery they try to heal themselves by medicine ain't even one thing you can heal the body that the blood of jesus christ that prophecy here we got to get realized here people people fall away their minds are falling away they rejected the message why because they don't eat the word this day y'all they got some man-made idea well my church was that what fell with the church i said you said well i'm going to be deceived how can i be deceived see that's what i want to get out of your mind how can you be deceived now if you say i'm deceived you're saying i have a perverted spirit i'm feminine because the feminist spirit was diseased but when we if you notice here when we get back and restore back to the word it says let the mind that was in christ not the mind that was in eve hallelujah what did he do he bring you back to your position honey adam was never deceived he was deceived adam was not guilty he was that what he tried to bring about when the word cannot be deceived that's the man's seed for this all that is what prophecy calls about back to the word so we cannot be deceived church i thank god for the word musicians come on all right that's why we can't be deceived why the word cannot be deceived she was deceived right she would deceive if you remember him when adam fell what did he tell adam adam when that unveiled when adam had his wife when adam had his when adam had it when god took his wife out what did he do he put adam into a what a deep sleep a deep sleep and he opened the side of adam and he took out of the side of adam a rib and all these things and he gave adam uh uh a help me and adam called her woman because she was taken out of man when she left had shipped she got a new name eve she was the mother of all living dead right oh that's what she is when you got a little baby i don't care pretty yes oh you suck but remember it's still deaf right until we go back to eating again hallelujah i don't got that but i want you to say this so don't close it it's just i'm not going to go into this now but when god put out him in a deep sleep if you notice he never woke adam up he just said when he brought it unto him a wife so adam's somewhere down here it looked like adam has never got woke up but then we go back over here and say matthew 25 said the bridegroom coming it's time to wake up that sleeping burger the bride grew coming and he called out that what the brother friend said he said the church was dead right right dad stealing it he said go take those seven thunders to wake up we're not no more sleep walking around in a state of of of of of conscious imagination we walk around in reality now a man that sleep wall don't know i see some people sleepwalk one time and they'll scare you to them they get up and they do all kinds of things when they sleep walking i remember one night remember i hate to tell this but dan you hear me i'm sorry i devote been that secret so i thought he apologized brother and he went on to meet the lord he might be listening this morning so me and my dad was there one night i was there with brother dad and brother was sick and he had these pills that the doctor gave him to make him sleep because he touched so many medicine you know what i'm talking about it was making him wire his body up he couldn't you couldn't get his body to go to sleep so brother damn was there now he took one he said brother he said would you like to have one i said yeah let me have one too i said i need to sleep i took that joke man i don't know what happened i was just laying in the bed all of a sudden something went out i don't know man i ain't dead brother tim's they walked in the room said brother jewel say i set up and i started talking to brother he said yeah man brother been knowing this and brought then i'm glad we were doing that wrong and brother we're doing this and doing we've been doing it and he said all of a sudden he looked at me he said this guy's not even won i was still speaking but i was not conscious of it adam was asleep but he was not conscious of him but under the opening of the seventh seal god brings back the mind of god the brain the consciousness back to the bride we've been in the toe we might have been in the foot but you got the mind now you ain't sleep no more bieber we'll walk up we know our bridegroom now hallelujah the day of redemption is near may god bless you this morning hope it ain't too
