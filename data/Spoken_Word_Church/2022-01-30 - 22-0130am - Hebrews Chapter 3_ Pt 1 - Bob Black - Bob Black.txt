TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you thanks all right let's uh last time we finished up uh hebrews chapter one and chapter two and we're on chapter three and we just did a little quick summary of of kind of the whole book of hebrews to kind of set the some context and what paul's talking about in hebrews is he's trying to uh set in the minds of the hebrews that um who christ is and what he did and how he paid the price for us and kind of shifting their attention from the the old testament judaistic way of of of uh you know doing meeting the law and sacrifices and so forth and shifting it shifting their focus and over to grace and uh so some of the things if we just kind of go through these little bullet lists of of things to kind of summarize paul's trying to get the attention that the son of god is the one who who spoke who speaks his ultimate word of revelation he's the one that was speaking through the apostles and prophets and he's the one that's doing the talking and so therefore he's greater than the angels and and greater than moses and greater than joshua and greater than aaron and greater than all the levitical order of priests so he's the one he's the focus of the of really the old book of hebrews and so as high priest of an eternal order like the order of melchizedek christ holds a permanent priesthood it's something that uh it's it's not something that you know like the aaronic priesthood ever every once in a while you'd have to get a new priest in and you'd have to continually offer sacrifices but yet the milk priest priesthood after the order of melchizedek is is permanent and it's it's it's once the sacrifice is made it's it's done christ is also a mediator of a new covenant so he's fulfilling the the the new covenant that jeremiah talked about in jeremiah 31 if you go back there and read about jeremiah actually prophesying that there is a new covenant coming and and he did that through his his gift of his sacrificial death and he was both the the fulfillment of the type of the sacrificial victim and the high priest that offered it so he's fulfilling all those types and his sacrifices is effective to accomplish salvation and and it's unrepeatable in other words once it's done you don't have to keep going back and and doing it over and over again now paul as as uh we kind of looked at last time briefly when as he's going through the weight the way you kind of get a feel for the way paul paul brings things out he'll do a little speaking and then he'll warn you and he'll do a little bit more speaking and he'll warn you so there's a lot of warnings in hebrews chapter three in chapter four it gets gets into it it gets into the very serious and solemn subject matters talking about uh how the the children going uh through the wilderness uh how they they began to drift away from god's word and became hard-hearted and those kind of things and all through the book of hebrews paul's giving warnings and in chapter two he's given a warning not to drift away from god's word and not to in chapter three and verse four not to be three in chapter four not to be hard-hearted and unresponsive and chapter five and chapter six not to remain spiritually immature in chapter 10 not to be disloyal to christ in chapter 12 not to refuse god's word and to press on the maturity in in jesus and then chapter 9 to to to press on to the new covenant that he initiated and the whole the whole book is really just uh a a a positive message to keep pressing forward in the face of adversity and suffering and and all kinds of the the things that come upon a believer through life so let's let's read if we'll go to the next slide let's start reading this let's read the chapter of hebrews chapter three and get into this there's some good things here so chapter verse 1 says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who was faithful to them that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house but this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses in as much as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast to confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end wherefore the next lie as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren lest there be any in any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the living god but exhort one another daily what it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice pardon not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he greed forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whoms where he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they cannot enter in because of unbelief so you can kind of see that the topic of hebrews chapter three is the children of israel journeying through the wilderness they begin to disbelieve and and and provoke god so i want to just kind of examine some of the things that they did to provoke god and and you can look back and and see um learn by their mistakes maybe and and kind of apply it to our life and and and see if you know if they were not able to go into the promise into the promised land because of the things that they did and the doubt that they did then uh we we should be ever d that paul is giving us a warning to be diligent so if we go to the next lie and we'll start kind of diving into this some of these things that paul said he said so in the first one wherefore holy brother and partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful and on his house it's it's interesting that a lot of the things that paul says he's actually almost like every other sentence that he says he's quoting something from the old testament and you could just imagine that people sitting around listening to paul that that um you know they would recognize things that he would say and it's and realize that he's he's actually just saying stating the word to them he's preaching exactly what the what the what the scripture had said that they were familiar with so he's quoting from numbers chapter 12 that says my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all my house and this is the this is where god was was talking to them after miriam and aaron began to doubt whether moses was really called to leave whether he was the only one that that that that god would be speaking to and they began to doubt and and and god told him moses is faithful in all mine house now we know a house is a house is a whole kingdom as a house is a uh everything that you own every house is all all of your belongings and your properties and all that all that goes into that but really if you want to just steal it distill it down a house is where you live so and and we're if as you read along you'll find out that that paul's kind of setting in your mind that god is a builder and he's all uh you know in in hebrews chapter one he talked about how the worlds are framed by the word of god and and and it framed up so god's framing things up and he's building things he built the universe he spun the the worlds off of his fingers he spun the galaxies off of his finger by the word by the word of his mouth he spoke everything into existence and framed it up and and our little earth that we live on and and so then if you if you go to the next slide he begins to talk about this house there's a there's a builder god is the builder and and the one that that uh if we read this in chapter in verse two it says he was faithful to him that had appointed him as also moses was faithful and on his house for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses and as much as he was building the house have more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things as god so he's talking about he's talking about all that god is really the master builder but he's made us workmen in that in that process now you think now what what he's getting at is is that the children of israel were they were provoked they provoked god by disbelieving the building process so in if you go to the next slide in exodus chapter 25 uh god commissioned moses we know he commissioned him to make let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them so he's telling moses to go build build in my house and if we go to the next slide we'll just run through some scriptures quickly that in hebrews 11 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god and and verse 10 for he looked for a city talking about job or abraham which have foundations whose builder and maker is god so god is the builder and the maker and i say also unto thee that thou art peter jesus telling peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail it so god's the one he's he's the master builder and in first corinthians chapter 3 verse 9 to 12 if we go to the next slide for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another build of their own but let every man take heed how he buildeth their poem for other foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is jesus christ and if we go to the next slide in first peter chapter 2 it says ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house because god is the builder he's a master builder and he he he yokes us into that process so that we have something to do in that we we we're we're preaching we're we're giving the word to people and and and building one another up like first thessalonians says wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do and edify means to build up and edify comes from that from the word edifice edifice edifice is the thing being built and to edify means to build up and that's what paul was talking about in ephesians chapter four he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the edifying of the body of christ to build up now so so that whole process now you you go back to hebrews chapter three what paul is talking about he's talking about moses going through the wilderness and he's keeps telling the people you're able to take the promised land god has got us here and he sends a pillar of fire and all these things and he's given them a word and he and and yet the people begin to to doubt the word the message that he's given to them to doubt they they continually doubt that god is able to quench their thirst from a rock they doubt that he's able to quench their hunger by giving a manna from heaven they doubt that they're able to defeat the giants that they have the power to go into that promised land and so they're doubting they're doubting the message so it's the message that they're doubting in other words they're doubting that god is trying to build up their faith and build up build them up to a place that where they can go into the promised land and by faith conquer and they begin to doubt now the process see the process now that god builds us up he builds he's building us up by by the word so that's why he he's given us teaching now now brother ram said in in adoption number one if we go to the next slide preaching usually catches the center brings them under condemnation by the word but teaching places a man positionally what he is in other words teaching is what what what gives you the ability to know what you believe when it's teached you when the word is taught then you you know how to be baptized you know what the name of god is you know whether or not god is divided up in three people or one god and and teaching begins to place you positionally so that you you can have confidence that you're able to defeat the goliath that you're able to go into the land and and partake of those grapes and partake of that those promises that god has given to you so the teaching you know that people kind of get uh get hung up on on on teaching maybe because it's hard and and uh maybe not as uh it's it's a little bit different than than you know when you go to a camp meeting and there's and everybody's around the altar and lots of shouting and things teaching settles you down in teaching because teaching gets you to a place where you know what you believe teaching teaching places a man positionally what he is now that's why i believe that you know paul said in ii timothy he said study study to show thyself approved unto god a workman in other words a builder somebody that's building what god wants us to build somebody that can this that's participating in god's work that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth how are you going to know how to divide the truth from the error if you don't study i believe that this is a study in church you know i i was thinking about this morning how you know standing out there with terrence some mornings you you hear people coming in in the parking lot and they're playing sermons and and uh and we we study the word because we believe in teaching but teaching and teaching is important because it shows you where you are and what you what what you're doing and i believe i believe that when you're called to preach you're called to study if you don't study then what what do you have to say you you get up and maybe uh say a few things about how god is good and and and god died for our sins and things but yet there's there's we we've got to study so that we can we're because we're we're we're working with god we have something we're trying to build up the faith of the people study to show thyself approved unto god because god wants us to know what the promises are now so in matthew chapter 28 verse 19 it says go you therefore and have you ever noticed that go you therefore and teach teach all nations go there go therefore and teach all nations teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even under the end of the world now what's what's this got to do with hebrews 3 again now they began to doubt the promises of god they began to doubt moses message they began to doubt that his commission was to take them out of egypt and take them into the promised land now you see all all through all through scripture there's this pattern repeated that when there's a message goes forth there's the enemies that come up against it like like what brother wade was preaching on wednesday night if we go to the next slide about in daniel 70 weeks when nehemiah and ezra began to build the the the temple wall the walls around the city and and it and it says that their enemies the enemies heard that that that they were they were doing their work and that we returned all of us to the wall everyone into his work and the bible says i'm just kind of trying to go through this quickly that began to work with with they began to work with a a sword in one hand and their trial and the other because you know when whenever whenever you try to do something for god you're always going to have somebody some somebody to come up to complain or tell you it's not working right that's what paul's talking about in hebrews chapter three the whole wilderness journey moses constantly had a constant stream of you're not doing it right i don't believe you're called i don't believe this and that but you just keep forging on keep moving ahead ignore all the naysayers because there's a work for you to do and the work is to build what god commissioned you to build so and if we go back go to the next slide paul's saying today if you will hear his voice harden not your heart as in the provocation do not harden your heart against the message of god that he's given to you think about how the children of israel's heart became so hard even to the point when when moses went up to bring down the ten commandments the revelation of god to them that their heart was so hard that they made a golden calf that they forgot what their purpose was what they forgot what they were there to do today if you will hear his voice now in the next slide i've got a little a little picture of sam or they're listening so it's so often that we fail to recognize when we hear god's voice like samuel there so uh you know he heard the voice of god in in the night and he and he woke up and he kept going over to to to the to the high priest to ask him if that was him and finally he recognized he got still and along with god began to recognize that god was speaking to him so that's what paul is talking about if you don't harden your heart but listen to the voice of god when god when he begins to pulsate down in your heart you recognize that that's god's speaking to you and moving on your heart to to build up your faith within you so on the next slide in the voice of the sign brother brown said that was only 40 miles about 40 years doing it it was because that they began to murmur against the voice that produced a sign how little did they know when they were shouting down there on the banks and dancing in the spirit and moses singing in the spirit there was only just a few days off but they began to murmur and wanted to do something different and they stayed 40 years in the wilderness and perished over it that's right because they didn't believe god said they're not talking against you moses they're talking against me that was god's voice not moses now they were all they were all going to church and they were all going in the sanctuary of the lord and and and doing the things that believers look it looks like believers do but yet they began to doubt the voice the void now now i i kind of want to bring this down a little bit as we just have a few more minutes to to close before we really get into the meat of this chapter but you know it's easy to think to recognize that the the voice it was that brother branham had the voice but bring it down actually to where you know you're sitting in church and a minister speaking to you and and you know you can begin to to doubt that the minister's saying the right thing or that the things that the minister of the or that your mama and daddy are saying let's bring it on down now because brother ram said in the laodicean church age he said the voice god still has a voice for the people of the world even as he's given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride now what does that you know when the children of israel were going over to cadence barney and and they listened to the voice of moses all that time and then finally they sent over the ten to ten spies into the land and they came back and they all had a voice and joshua and caleb had that they came back with the same voice that moses had we're able to take the land the giants ain't going to be nothing to us because we got with god with us so they had they came back with that same message so if you're saying the same message you're preaching the same thing you've got that same voice now in revelation chapter one i'm just kind of quickly going through these things revelation chapter 1 verse 13 to 15 says looking at when john turned to look at the son of man and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in the furnace and his voice says the sound of many waters and waters is people so they now they were all saying the same thing they had the same confession just like jeremiah in chapter 33 said the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride so the bride's got a voice too so what's the point the point is don't harden your heart when you hear the voice it don't matter if it comes from a donkey if it's the voice of god listen to it because it's the voice don't don't harden your heart to the promises of god now now let's think about the children of israel as they were coming out of egypt we know we know what an exodus is and and uh if you go to the next slide the hebrews chapter three is really focusing on that that kind of middle period as they had come out of egypt and they were on their way into the promised land so what's an exodus an exodus is an exodus is going out of coming out of and going into and so the exodus the children of israel they came out of egypt and they went through the wilderness on the way to the promised land and they couldn't quite make it to the promised land now we know that types compare that to justification the sanctification of baptism in the holy ghost the three stages of your journey and brother ram taught that there was three exoduses it was the children of israel from coming out of that this one that paul was talking about from egypt to the promised land and then there was that the second exodus was from a spiritual condition from judaism to the baptism of the holy ghost from turning malachi chapter 4 turning the fathers the fathers to the children the faith of the fathers to the children pivoting them over to that to to understanding that god was able to he paid the price for their sins and was able to fill them with the holy ghost and then now the third exodus is to turn our hearts back to the original faith of the pentecostal fathers to turn our to to call out a bride from the church now these are the things that brother brown actually said from a spiritual condition to the baptism of the holy ghost and from the church to the bride and that's what the voice does to call us so so brother brown said in hebrews chapter 4 when he was preaching this in 1957 he said and now you've got a free choice god broods back to you and say hear my voice harden not your heart like in the days of provocation here he comes down preaches the word the gospel preached unto them was not didn't have faith in it so it didn't do them no good they heard it but they didn't believe it god come down he showed them a pillar of fire showed by his prophets signs and wonders he was with him they didn't believe it oh they like to see the miracles they like to hear the prophet but as far as believing it they didn't their lives proves they didn't now he said don't you fall after that same example of unbelief or in this last days to the gentile church god has appeared again same sign same wonder same pillar of fire vindicated proven let us not harden our hearts and fall in that temptation back yonder of unbelief but we'll rot on earth and that'll be all of it now so what will they they provoke god by their unbelief and by their unbelief they were unable to move forward so let now i i've only got a few more minutes but i want to i really wanted to dive into the things that they did to provoke god because there's lessons in here that we can learn from as you as you look back and see see see how they failed now there's really there's 14 provocations 14 things that they did and and uh when they when they finally got to cadence barnea god actually there's a scripture where god was telling moses you've they've they've messed up ten times already they've there's ten provocations then after that there were four more let's start back when moses first got his commission if you go to the next life and exodus chapter five when this is talking about when they when moses began to go to pharaoh and tell him i'm going to you need to let my people go and pharaoh gave him more work to do and it says the offers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said you shall not minish all from your bricks of your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because you have made our savior to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us so they began to they began to trust in moses and put their confidence in him and and he went and made his testimony to to pharaoh and it looked like things got worse for him now now you know apply that to your own christian life maybe when you first began to be a christian that things like seem like they they kind of began to get in some cases worse for you now you had you had to live it in front of your people at work and maybe they started to hate i've heard testimonies from people talking about the the rough time that their co-workers have given them and and and different thing because many times it's it's uh there's some rough spots that you have to go through as a christian now so they they they they started off with a little rough spot it looked like there was more work for there was more work that they had to do and they began to say well you know what it'd be better for us to just stay down here in egypt and not have all this work pile on us and they begin to doubt what were they doubting they were they were doubting that god had something better in the store for them that if they just trust in the word of god that god would lead them to a promised land but yet they doubted because for just a little bit it got more grief griesson you know some many times being a christian is is full of grief and full of strife and and and and not a bed of roses and so but a real christian now you you go back if you if you listen to what uh brother brown said in hebrews chapter four when he was preaching this sermon he said when when troubles come you got to keep pressing on don't do like these these hebrews children and and begin to doubt and wonder if god and the musicians can go ahead and come begin to doubt if god still loves you and if he's still going to fulfill his promises in your life but keep pressing on and believing his word don't harden your heart as in the provocation and we'll stop right there and continue on next time [Applause] you
