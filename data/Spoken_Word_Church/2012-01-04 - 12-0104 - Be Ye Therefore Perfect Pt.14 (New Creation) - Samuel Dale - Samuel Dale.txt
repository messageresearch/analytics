I apologize the father has a plan though it's hard to see right now storms around the directions I let God move Pain still breaks the way boys when the free round s when the time is tennis and you wonder where you've been there's never been a moment hands weren't reaching out you you can rest assured should be secured he's moving right now stand still and lift up moves standing still it's hard to do when you feel you you may wait stand still and let God move D to have received you you and let God move an answer will come in his standstill and let God move and still come on that's right but we sometimes can't do that if we just start the very foundation work away Lord amen let's turn into the book here 24 224 it's step by Tank each step I take my savior grows with these friends today he

amen and I'm starting it brand new year getting to go and everything looking forward to this year you know the Mayan calendar Runs Out I just hope everything else runs out this will be the time you know but we're not worried about that right we're just concerned with other things you know that's getting God here and getting everything ready and I'm like that I really enjoyed the the weekend and the time with with brother uh Tom Ernest they're preaching for us that's right enjoyed to watch Night Service and on and the singing and all the doings and all of the cooking and the things that you brought in all that we had a good time fellowshipping together and I really really enjoyed it now remember the Bible study will not be this coming Saturday night always the first Saturday all right it'll be the second Saturday this month because uh we don't want to do it with weight being gone and everything and he's going to be down with brother Collins preaching for him to get an opportunity you want to go down let us know and uh but we will have the bible study on the second Saturday of this month you know good to have her visitor back there with us and I think he's been here before down through the years but you know remember him he used to be a whole lot smaller and you know he's been downstairs I know the other few weeks ago but this is great to have it with us we always say to you when you come one time your visitor two times Port Elizabeth you don't get welcomed on the second time you just welcome the first time I'm glad to have you with us and hope you enjoy the services amen amen just remember those announcements you know uh two I'm going to try if I can tonight and Sunday morning to finish up this series that I've been in on be therefore perfect and probably Sunday afternoon now we will have a question and answers comments Etc so whatever you think about what I've said and talked to you write it down and turn it in and we'll be glad to read it and talk about it a little bit and see you know what everything is okay so that's all right I do remember that amen if you'd like turning your scripture turn to Matthew 5 we've been reading this about 13 times and then we're going to Second Corinthians 5 7 I was laughing this brother Ernest about it he said you know run around and could take a four-leaf clover and priest for 10 years or something off of it and I'd laugh and told him that the other day I said I've read the same scriptures preached 60 sermons off the one scripture and I'd always read a subtitle you know a sub scripture to go with it but I have read the same scripture and preached 60 sermons so don't worry about it you can't exhaust the word of God that's right it just gets better and better and better along the way Matthew 5 and II Corinthians wow we thank you Lord Jesus for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day that we have and we ask you now that you would just come Among Us and Lord not being on looker to record our actions tonight but be a preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives we love you we thank you we appreciate this year that we have because we look forward every day we go forward and knowing that we're one day closer to your returning and finishing up all that has to be done here and Lord we believe that we're in on that part of it and we thank you and we ask you to just help us now as we read your word talk about you if you would come on the scene in each one of our hearts and lives and speak to us forgive our sins and lead us by that understanding and keep us in Jesus name amen amen amen Matthew 5 37-48 remember now this is the finishing up of the Beatitudes and then the Lord Jesus is sitting down and just come when he's told you how blessed you are now he's setting down the nature or character or or things that we should have to be as his children and showing this to be like him all right let your communication be a verse 37 99 for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you've heard that it has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man shall Sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go of my own goal with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away that's like I said sometimes the Bible needs to be explained if somebody keeps barring from you that doesn't apply right here okay if somebody want to borrow from you fine but if they don't pay you and they borrow again and bar again you're the loser that's not this Bible telling you to do that it's just telling you a good Christian life because after you go so far you cut it off you know One schmachi on One Cheek turn the other that's right but you don't have to keep turning it backwards and forward back and forth run or do something you know get away and stop the whole thing or whatever you know but think about it because it's it's just telling us you heard it happening say it Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do do good to them that hate you and pray for him which despitefully use you and persecute you and she may be the children see these are the things that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good instead of Reign on the just and the unjust or if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so then what does he sum it up with talking about a great life right what to do then he says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now go over to second Corinthians 5 just reverse 17. therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature that word is creation right right he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new I mean if you see that the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been as I said a moment ago there for quite a while now I'm speaking on the things of what we believe about this and the Lord willingness laying on my heart I may start a series after this I'm not sure now but I may try to uh take a thought or for a while and just express some of the doctrines of the message and what do people believe and why I don't believe some of the things that the people believe and when I believe what I believe because we have new ones Among Us and also the internet system has opened up now going out to others around the world and you know so we we I may do that now I'm not certain I've got a couple of talks on my mind and you just pray which one will come forth because I don't never know I just wait and then I'll get until they start thinking on something and I get enough notes written for three or four months and then I finally start preaching on it but the brother made a good point the other night I don't know whether that was his exact comment that he meant but he made a good point there's a lot of things in the Bible that are just plain language when it says do this don't do this do that don't do that whatever that's plain language I've heard sermon on don't tear down the neighbors Pastor fence making the old days there with a lot of legalism going around and I've heard sermons on those things and you know well I didn't have to worry about it because when we was raised up if we tore down the neighbor's fence we'd put it back up and put his cows up got a whipping we got all of it so I didn't have to be told not to tear down the neighbors Pastor Finch I knew better to do that right because I didn't want to get a whipping you know the way we were if if you got a weapon at school and went home and told Mom and Daddy you just got another one automatically yeah it wasn't whether or not they you took they didn't ask you whose side you was on or try to join it when the only time I ever seen my mother upset is they whipped my brother one day for something and she wasn't upset with them about whipping what he done he was just upset for the fact that he had risings all over his bottom and a few of them got busted by the teacher but that was the only time I've ever seen her because other than that it was just the fact that you got a whooping there you get one at home right so we didn't have to handle that so there's a lot of things in the Bible there's a letter away there's a lot of sermons that you'll listen to brother Branham on uh like hear ye him that he will not necessarily be talking about adoption right he would just be talking about hearing the Lord he won't even relate it to adoption so there's a lot of things in the Bible and I've been thinking on that for quite a while now I'm just nice let it run and you know getting caught wheels and they work around every once in a while and come out with something but you just pray for me but we'll try to do that all right now the last message we just took last Wednesday night we just took a thought and we had to cut off because I get too much information to put forth and but we were talking about the message to this age and I want to make sure and back up on that a little and then move on with our thought now the message to this age is the complete full Plan of Redemption amen all right you agree amen this is the age when it's to be received total complete plan right all right now down Through the Ages they received a new birth he say he's got the new birth the birth of that age all right and each age would be a part of what Paul said of the new creature right everybody that ever got born again is a part of the body of Jesus Christ right and they're a new creature or a new creation all right now that was understood all the way down but now they didn't understand the fullness they did to a degree in the Disciples of adoption and spoke of it but they didn't know how to bring it to a completion so that would be left for this end time you know for us to understand the the adoptions and the things of this end time part but no one has ever been uh concerned about the change of the body right even though Paul and him spoke of it I'm sure he he thought about it and I don't believe he believed in getting a new body right right I don't believe that I'm against that Doctrine I don't believe that we're going to get anybody I believe it's this body made new Redemption redeem this body right make this body new right all right we'll get to it in a minute you mean you're going to save the soul in Redemption and destroy the body but there's a big following among the Believers of the message that believe that well yeah I believe that when I say at this age gets the complete Plan of Redemption all right and it will for the body it's for the soul the being and it's for the body and even for this world that we're living on that's right right need I'd ask you if you would to read or listen to the message the future home and you'll see what I'm talking about page 15 16. I'm going to do that of the future home all right this is the age to understand the complete plan that's right even we understand what will transpire past our time amen that's right we understand because that was you know God said to Abraham cannot withhold anything from Abraham see he's the heir you know so it was given to him right all right we're the seat of Abraham so we get we know what's going to happen to the Jews after we leave here that's right we know what's going to happen to the foolish virgins we know what that the white Throne is going to be we know all about the Millennium and not all I'm just saying oh we know about the Millennium amen we know about the future home all right which was totally contrary to 99.9 I say of the religious world that's right when the prophet began to speak on those signs because if you were going to believe in in uh you're going to have to get you a new body then where's it coming from right where would it or not where would it come from when we would all agree that uh as far as Sin is concerned upon the Earth and how far it's went that one day it'll be annihilated right not the not the planet not the core of the earth not the the thing but in this change in form right right all right so then if that's true then you would have to go to another planet get your body and come back here maybe because you would probably want to think you're going to be here or whatever so you'd have to go somewhere else and get your body that's just I know I'm carnal but that's just the way I think I'm sorry I didn't say maximum right right all right then if I can think natural and it turn down your spiritual I'm sorry you know I don't mean to I just mean to be truthful and just talk the way I am Amen in that way you don't have to say well I wonder why brother Dale believes on this just ask me that's right and if you'll hang around for just a little while you won't have to worry about your deal with no water blood all right what do you understand what I'm talking about see each age gotten a new birth and they would be a new creature in Christ Jesus that Paul spoke of Amen but not knowing the complete Plan of Redemption which would take the seals to break the things of the prophet's message so you bring out those to this age all right then we could see that the body this body that we're living in to redeem it would mean that it would come to a place of a new creation amen if your soul is a new creature our new creation in Christ Jesus then the body would be a new creation but it wouldn't be another creation amen see that's the difference the word you can be used if you understand how to use it amen if not it will mean something different right yeah you say new well a new new bottle I mean it never existed before well let's see in the scriptural terminology the word new can be where it can be made Eternal amen right right so he makes up eternal you truly got it redeemed right all right and if the soul is returned Eternal right by the new birth then truly more to understand it is redeemed amen amen all right because it can't go back any further than being Eternal right because that would be as far as you can go you know that's what I've always said how far do you want to be redeemed back to this body one day will be a new creation that's right because it'll be made eternal all right that's simple right um the end of world one day we'll get a fiery baptism right right to cleanse off all things as we're reading just a minute and then it can be made eternal so brother they'll always just thought we'd come back to a natural world huh I don't agree I'm dishonest I believe the world we're coming back to is going to be a brand new right but not a different one right amen we'll read in a second as far as Sin goes like I told you the other day as far as as an adult right a bit drill down through the Earth that was sin right and that school got to be claimed that far amen and as far as these Rockets go out that way it's got to be cleansed because it polluted the system see then but it won't annihilate that's right right because your soul is not annihilated that's right right amen hey I know what running around say yes and I know where there's some of the doctrines that we'll get to people talking about a New Soul all right we'll see is it this soul mate new right to give you another a new spirit is not to take your spirit out rip it out of you and put another Spirit In You it's just to take away the nature of this thing amen see to convert it right Redemption I don't I don't understand because then if you believe that the world can be made Eternal what would you have any trouble about your body be man he tried it man do you believe your body would be made Eternal why would you worry about your soul being Eternal now let's go the other way if you believe your soul is eternal why would you worry about your body you think God ain't able you think he ain't able to make this body eternal he cleansed and claimed it right that's right when he gave you the new birth brother Robin said it same as the Lord Jesus on the River Jordan yep when he said this is my part of the earth that I redeemed and from this I will redeem the rest of it amen that's right you get that new bird got laid claim on that body that's why you're not going to get another one amen that's right it's going to be this body made eternity wouldn't that be wonderful amen I'm sure glad it won't be no 71 year old Eternal that won't work but now just get down to the point if you don't get nothing out of the message tonight get the one thing I tried to explain it Wednesday if you get if you talk about a new creation then and we know that it's not Annihilation or something that's right when it's taking what you've got right and placing eternal life within you because that's what God has done right by the new murder all right see then he redeems his soul all right then you're a new creature in Soul amen our body in the world and all these other things it's still out here of this old order amen of life with that New Birth by the prophet would say the most important thing in your life is the new birth amen yes sir because you're not mourned again it's not even going not talking to you right you're not even talking about you in the Bible other than he's going to annihilate you right you know there's a lot of people and I'm not against people I love people you know that I want everybody to be saved because the Lord Jesus wanted everybody to say it but he knew it wouldn't work but that's I know it won't either but I wish everybody could receive the message or the hour in its Purity in truth that's right all seven billion people in the world could receive eternal life today if they would just get rid of themselves and do what I tried to explain what is the qualifications of being born again we said well it's just kids I've been baptism logo okay that's fine but let's break it down simple and without this simple-minded I got a ninth grade education so I don't mind saying that just be simple in your thinking the qualifications for being born again is for you and I to die right is that simple enough right right for us to die that he might live right there simple terminology simple revelation to just believe what God has said he gave us the new birth Paul said makes you a new creature amen all right now if he makes you a new Creator a new creature or creation did it meant and listen this is my point of trying to get over Wednesday it meant you wasn't that right because if he was a new creation then what would you be making a new creation out of a new creation right man we were of the old creation by sin right right Body Spirit Soul perversion of the world everything because of sin all right now if we become a new creature becoming a child of God no wonder brother Bradham would say I'm not the son of Charles and hella Brown he wasn't denying his mother and daddy he was telling you why do you come to the place to realize a new creature means we're not of this world right is that what the Lord Jesus said to you say I'm not of this world and he said you're not of this world right if you're born again you're not in this world right amen all right that's why I told everybody I believe it and you saved my life and whatever pretty much okay it makes good point sometimes I believe ever born again believer is the Genesis 1 26-27 person amen where he said let us make man in our own image and our lives and etc etc amen because that's eternal life right right amen and ever born again believer spiritually speaking has the same DNA right amen did you understand what I said spiritually speaking right amen we are the same spiritually speak in DNA amen well because we're the children of God right we're his offspring yeah amen amen I don't need a great big light bulb to turn on dude no it needs a new birth needs a new bird to be able to believe that God would do that for you tonight see then this is a a total different creation we'll get to it the minute agree if we don't I'm preaching y'all can read the notes layer a brand new creation amen Jesus was the beginning of that creation that's right that's right see from Adam down because president said that I've had eternal life so I believe that well he was the first but everybody from then on didn't have no eternal life right in Jesus Christ came not having eternal life not receiving eternal life but was eternalized yes sir amen because he was almighty God Amen that's right see then he was the product of eternal life amen a brand new race we talk about a Superman we talk about all kind of things your kids see it you know the these superheroes and where they're coming from other planets like Superman did you don't know which the young God came down to live that we that he could give his life amen that you and I could live that we could be you creatures right that's why we're different that's why we live in a world different when we act different we dress different we we obey different we behave different well because we're not of this world right we're a new creature man and a new creature means exactly what it is something that never existed before he said well he was all about yes remember you had to get down here too and we've got we got down here we was lost right right that's the best way to say it right right now when we receive eternal life that makes the connection back to Eternity that's right amen but we must receive it here if not why did Jesus Christ have to die amen why did he just come into the world and say hey all you my children come on we're going up now he came to his only his own receipt and not but as many as he can get any part of becoming something amen amen is that what the Bible says right all right all right now Within let's deal with something for a minute let's think about this thing seriously about how that when you receive that new birth you didn't physically die right right when Ezekiel said I give you a new heart a new spirit I'm glad we had a prophet to explain those times because we were all confused about what it was that's right but he said now that new spirit he said that's not the Holy Spirit right he said that God just took your spirit and changed it in a way that you could get along with somebody else and get along God all right they said that's not the new birth right and he said when I put my spirit in you he said there's your new birth right amen all right that's why you didn't have anybody in the Old Testament of this creation that I'm talking about right amen Adam was only prefigure right Adam was by impartation simply putting it down giving it you've never done anything to receive right the foolish virgins the Jews that receive eternal life that's an impartation one day they don't do anything here and receive it or maybe they may be good to somebody or something like that of a foolish virgin nature but still it's by an impartation God just gives it to him was the other person that has a new birth has to go through the basis of dying to their self right accepting Jesus Christ as their savior all right believing that he has accepted them because we can accept him but if he don't accept us right you see he knows whether we're sincere that's what I was trying to explain last week do you take this Bible he says you believe in your heart confess with your mouth God will save you that's Bible amen but act on a lot of people believe in their heart accepted and speak with them out and wind up not being saved right right right I'm sure not everybody except Lord Lord right so then there's something wrong in the receiving part right the ability to be able to believe amen if if I can't believe that Jesus Christ took my place then how can he take my place right if I can't believe he died for me then how can you know when he died for everybody well that's just a blanket that's throw it out there let everybody have it you know right no you don't get saved that away that's right you don't get saved believe that everybody will be saved all right you get saved by believing that Jesus Christ died for you right man you accept what he said and then he accepts you right all right so that's where the Prophet said he says not whether you accept him or not it's whether he accepts you that's right but now if you don't accept him he can't accept you so now he's not doing away with you accepting him right you hear him say that that fasting and praying Etc doing this didn't save you okay that's right that's perfect well show me one time he ever said it's wrong to fast and pray right because he told you what that done fasting and praying get yourself out of the way you're fasted you get yourself out of the way that's right the prophet of God said if you feel led to Feist you won't get hungry right right that's right man I went on a mini face and starved to death I'm honest I'm not making a joke just tell me like it is one time the Lord burdened me about something I put on the fast and I went for three straight days doing nothing but drinking liquids of anymore at the end of that three days I had my answer he gave it to me I had to go back to eating because I was not hungry right right I didn't want to not to eat but at other times I went on to myself and I sure starved to death and suffered through two or three days and you know finally get back to eating I'm dishonest all right see if everybody be honest it would be a whole lot better world you know like you see these fillers you know they say oh they've been on The 40-day Fast and you see them and what they've done is they bought about 10 to salvages you know they're they're maybe a a 38 like I am down here and out here for a little more but you know and they're 38 and you see them and they buy about a 50 size pair of pants you know and they pull the belt around you know boy look look at him man look at him he just feel like it's done he's been fasting for 40 days there ain't no such thing in the Bible the prophet said right the Lord Jesus was the only person ever fasted 40 days brother Brown and said you want to quote he said I've never fasted over three days in my life I've been a been challenged on that and I've got it where he said it so don't worry about it because a lot of people think that he did he would eat one meal a day how about time do you go did he get ready for a meeting he fast for two or three days but uh okay here we go but listen everybody is a new creature that's born again because that's what started on the dip income it was a different entirely different breed amen a breed of people started on the net Pentecost that had never existed in the world right of all of The Davids and the the Sauls and the Solomons and the great things that happened in the the you know killing the bird and killing the lines and all of that right I was done by people that were not of this new race because Jesus was the first of that race amen that's why I called him in Revelations 3 14 then the beginning of the creation of God that's right amen all right and see being that then he started a new race a super race of people we're in the days of superstars super this super that and they're there that people can run day in and day out just run just day in and day out and then fall in the water and swim for 10 miles did you super it's because they framed their bodies and their minds but that's not the new race that I'm moving to be a part of Amen I saw well and good but you know it's not that kind of a race of people amen right right it's a race of people that God spoke of all the way through man and I know my friend won't get there today but I'll get to it Sunday but that's why David when David was saying blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin he wasn't talking about himself do you thinking watch you think he was just saying like hey bless you I tell you what God thanks so much of me he didn't kill me when I let my clear adultery I done all these things he didn't kill me cause he loved me now you got a thought like that you're you're right in the middle of the devil's trap in a garbage can right man right see David was speaking of you and I am that's right he was speaking of this new race of people that's what I've tried to get across to you about the point of being perfect the only way to be perfect is let him live in you and I we're not perfect in ourselves right but in Jesus Christ we are perfect right amen mom because you can't charge god with sin that's all right amen but I I tried to explain it go to that let's get this we don't get an announcement go to Psalms 30 32. where David says this see David was speaking of you and I am God Must Love Me what do you think he was saying we would just read the Bible and see what he was saying that's what I like to do that's why I said I just like to read it and see what it says and I believe it did in that way I didn't give him this what's wrong it won't be on the screen if they can grab it up quick enough I don't know Psalms 32. they were doing good the other night so they'll have it up before I get to a reason I really like that about the helicopter call you can write down our language most of you never know nothing about how they called you know and it is hey man I was in the days I had a call and so I told them later about it the Miss man this comedian came up with a joke about it if we found out later about it but see the reason they called it attic all they had to call it something I mean that was their day that was the thought of our day they had to call it something because they called it had it all 12 off y'all yeah same thing as a beer and it was disappointed didn't believe in the handicapped out for religions all right but listen blessed is he whose transgressions Is Forgiven and sin is covered match it is a man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no God all right now that looks like to take it in our own thoughts make sure you leave it up over 1 verse five in a minute that it looks like David is just saying I get about anything and like he's saying that there's somebody in the world is good enough God thinks enough of him he ain't going to impute sin that's why I've tried my best to preach it to you the only person that God won't impute sin to is a dead man right amen you can't accuse my dad you're sinning or doing something wrong he's been dead 45 years or more um we want that he died in 45 so you calculate but if you're born again and the only way you'll be born again is for you to die we are the only religion in the world that our leader had to die there's no other religion in the world like that right name one name any religion where the leader had to die oh we talked about all he wrote the books he'd done this I don't know but our leader had to die right to give us eternal life and you don't want to be part of this body of Christ we have to die amen to ourselves and be warned again to the only man that God wanted to send to is a dead man right right I don't mean physically dead I mean a man that has spiritually died to himself right that's right well that's what David was speaking of right all right because like I told you here's David saying blessed is he is all that and he's over there dealing with who is it Nathan the prophet right and if it had not been for the prophet of God David would have died because he called his own condemnation when Nathan gave the story about the the one and not having one lamb and all of a sudden the other and David said bring the man here I'll kill him David you're the man finished his own death sentence the night and said in that damage you won't die that's right I pray for you amen thank you Lord amen God has told me to come and tell you right you won't die but the baby will look like his sins was counted to him doesn't it yep sure you see I didn't even know the rest of them scripture pull it back up now brother let's read the whole thing bless you this he whose transgressions Is Forgiven who sin is covered see it actually said doesn't even say that Paul comes on later and picks up you know about the sin right unless it is a man of tune to the Lord if youth not iniquity and whose Spirit never has known God wrote it up now we're going to read verse 5. I acknowledge my sin unto thee much and my iniquity have I'm not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sins David wouldn't say it blessed am I that God wanted pukes into me he tells you exactly what he done he acknowledged his sin amen he confessed his sin if I didn't hide my iniquity I tried to but when it got exposed I admitted it and the Bible says back in the Old Testament what if a man of an honest and a contrite heart that God looks too amen oh David was this special in the message they got it there's this special seed their special doing I would like for you to explain something to me you believe in Abraham you believe that Abraham and his seed after him and that we are the seat of Abraham by faith you agree sure amen you know that Abraham received an unconditional Covenant is that true right he said Abraham I've already done it salvations of the Lord Jonah 2 and 9. but show me where Abraham got by what he was doing right show me where David got by what he was doing no he was praying constantly to get rid of all of those things right right bring it out show me in the seat of Abraham whether you've got a right to just live like the devil and say you're saved anyway that ain't even Baptist Doctrine they didn't even believe that far off yeah right you hear it the people of this message they don't matter what I do I was a seed we'll get to that Sunday God wanted sin to that seed right that's right because he ain't for one seed and that's the word of God Amen and you want these others before Sunday the seed of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's right Max press that one a little right you say it's just a seat and all the ram said it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seed of God Amen so what are we trying to be but you see what David is saying I wrote in my Bible where I wouldn't forget it if David wasn't thinking about when he was just saying this up here in Prophecy by the Holy Spirit if he wasn't thinking about the life that he lived why would he acknowledge his sin but then he said bless God I'm one of them up there are two verses above I don't have to worry about it because I got it made now that's worse than the Baptist we didn't even believe that in the Baptist Church we at least believe in repent I just didn't believe it sin far enough when he died you know you're still going to heaven because you painted the parking lot I'm not joking put it in new pews your name's on the end of the few well they got to be in heaven like brother Stephen Wilson said ain't nobody going to hell no more they're gonna have to do away with it yeah why because everybody is a Christian all right of what let's get down to something well I've done wasted my time listen but listen and I wrote down please listen to the Future home got the title down yet is not the future home it's the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly Brown now that's the title of the message amen we are the Earthly bride amen right come on let's get into it let's read what the prophet did and let's say there's a little bit and then we'll quick all right I'll get this Sunday just going with it go ahead and pull up number one on another Sprint because what I want you to see is that we are not annihilated when we receive the new birth we're born again right my old nature yes my old ways yes annihilated but he put eternal life into my soul he didn't destroy my soul he gave eternal life to me all right and then deciding for the world and sign for her body so that's just what we're reading so listen thank you join the whole world frame did not destroy By the Waters when it was washed off you know the Bible says that the world was destroyed in the days of Noah by the way right yeah right but how is it destroyed was it totally annihilated I was just washed off which one was it who just washed off right that's why you got alligator fossils up here in in Indiana full grown alligator fossils up in Indiana because that's where they were living at and then this thing went through a chaos and it just washed and it just settled in his washing it settled and just just moved everything everywhere right man all right but listen By the Waters when it was washed off the frame of the planet the old frame the all the dirt all the stuff that God put on the Earth was not destroyed when the first world was destroyed and the Bible said it was to start so but it never destroyed the frame it just destroyed the sin and sinners that was on it the framework remained that's right but the next one that was paragraph 160 in the future home this is paragraph 164. I saw the old world frame work was not destroyed by the water the world was only washed off that got its baptism it was baptized right so will the framework remain though it be burnt by fire it don't destroy the Earth see it just destroys the sin that's only you know that's that's word that you've got to take the Bible of what it says but yet you take it to him I tell you what I don't care what anybody says my Bible said the world was destroyed and the days of Noah uh what planet did we come off of right you know did Noah and his sons and their families did they take a spaceship and run up to Mars or Venus or somewhere and land on another planet and started off a new world or whatever read the Bible we need an understanding amen right the sin was destroyed the world world means Cosmos the Greek word therefore Hebrew right it's Cosmos which means World Order it's like we say you know we're talking we say well you know well oh man come up here you want everybody in the building you don't walk up here right now if I said all men maybe it would change the situation right but see mankind all right it's just we've got to do it and thank God for somebody that was a seventh grade education man that God could speak to am I now listen let the theologians couldn't understand it and he'd have to even spell the word because he couldn't pronounce it right right yep they ain't doing anything more theologians sitting out there and him saying something he's doing look at that little idiot who do you think he is if you manage success now that word there is the same word for pass away did you theologians know that word may pass away you see what I'm getting at the education that's the Holy Ghost right all right let's go a little further paragraph 166. notice here some of you Bible students and especially Dr Dale oh me I don't think it was me yeah because I wasn't there okay I think that's Dr Bale yeah they should have put bail there but they put down that would they got a good life on that the other day when I lost her and I remembered it years ago that I've seen the doctor Dale that was that something Dr Vale was a theologian but he was a self-trained theologian you know no school training yourself trying to deal over there all right especially Dr Dale looking at me notice in Peter in the second chapter of Peter third chapter of it he uses the word world as a Greek word Cosmos which means the world order the Earth shall pass away melt the elements with fervent heat that's what the Bible says in the Bible see it doesn't mean that the Earth the planet is going to pass away but the world Cosmos I like that one everybody like that next word politics that's right amen blood suckers amen Cosmos for politics the Sinners the system they might get me for that in one day sin disease germ everything that's wrong will pass away right and what did I like about you you got all these down here that's reading our life so you've got sin and sickness and germ now and then he said politics politics is first that's all right right not around know how to talk amen all right jump on down you read in between and here Peter said and we'll melt with fervent Heat and the works that are in burnt up not the planet The Works that are in the works of man all their politicians and their schemes and all their denominations in man-made schemes we'll all go with it when it burns and it won't be no presidential election in heaven we won't have to worry about who's going to be in charge that's right you see what I'm talking about all right going over paragraphs 171. this is all in continue reading right on down in the future home you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there oh man they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait till this Earth gets your baptism the H2O the water for the Bible said here in Revelation 21. see H2O is a two-part hydrogen one part oxygen that's what water is made out of the stuff you drink to stay alive is a deadly explosive you ever thought of that it's deadly because there's two parts hydrogen one part oxygen if you can some way in the world that's why they would afraid when they set the first atom bomb off and they split the atom they were afraid if they hit that correctly and they say if they had it it would have blow the whole world up see because it's water deadly explosion Whoever thought about fertilizer being an explosion right and the guy took it out there and went to Oklahoma somewhere and blowed that place up with fertilizer right you know there's a lot of things in the world that's that's not her but now listen and there was no more sea exploded this would change the whole surface of the entire Earth she'll burst and blow to pieces on the outside the crusted for hundreds of feet below it would just simply be completely demolished the atmospheres the gases that's in the earth now what where they're finding these missiles they can't get through it a great spear up in there way up in some kind of a spirit that there's all kinds of gases they say and that'll burst the holy wrath of God will come upon that sea and will cleanse it we'll change the entire surface now many of you that want to put down this word the Greek word pass away it comes from the word I had to find it and I thought how is this work how is this world going to pass away and yet we're going to live on it you get the point see when I put presses they they darken it out in different colors all right that was my emphasis he was going to pass away how are we going to live on it right so where we're gonna live it's the passageway we're going to Mars Venus Jupiter where we're going no well John saw that coming down on him right here but if you'll notice some of you people that wants to put it down there I'll spell it for you and I can't pronounce it so we spelled a big long word I don't know how to pronounce it all right and she said that and when the inspiration strikes he tells you how to get it so Heaven and Earth will pass away now this word means passing from one form to another it does not mean Annihilation as the English word would mean pass away it's annihilated but the Hebrew word or the Greek word here does not mean pass away it means from means from passing watch it means from passing from one thing to another right look what look but to pass from one condition that says to another amen now I hope you're thinking about your soul man do not just thinking about a world out there but around is explaining Redemption he said it on a future home by Page 15. he says you don't get what I'm talking about on the future home he said I hope you get the Plan of Redemption at least get the Plan of Redemption for the soul right your soul wasn't annihilated right right he just took the devil out took out the nature of the uncleanness because Jesus said the unclean Spirit goeth out of the Lamb walk Us in dry places that's what's supposed to happen with sanctification right all right then when it comes forth what are we to be a new creature I noticed Paul used it if you want to read it now put it down you can read it later in Titus 3 5 Paul is using this same word means regeneration of man that man that's passed from a center to a saint not completely annihilated when a man has changed he isn't annihilated but he has changed he but he's a changed person he has been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated amen the same word going through and I don't blow that right around and said Jesus used the same word when he said go loose the coat right remember he told him to go get the code word to bring it to it they brought the the white donkey and he wrote it into Jerusalem that same word loose he said the same word was used when he told him that Lazarus was great Lucy it's the same word it means changing from one form to another form amen amen it doesn't mean Annihilation right when you get borned again it's not too annihilated right amen he is just that Soul inside of the Earth the nature of it has been changed I know that goes into the two Soul peoples and all this others but that's all right the main thing I tried to tell them is this plain language they can't even read the two Soul people always said the soul is just the nature of the spirit show me one quote right around him says that what do you mean we got paid out of page at the page sold to me hey you left down at work right around and never said the soul is just the nature of the spirit he said their soul is the nature of this amen there's a lot of difference try when you say the soul is just the nature of the spirit you're making that all it can ever be good it's just that establishes it to be what it is that's just a bottle right but you see take that bottle redo it then you take away the word just and it can become paper Maybe you know wood I'll be back they can go back to another form but when you say the soul is just the nature of the spirit then you're misinterpreting right around amen the nature he said on on sold in prison the nature of your soul is God if you're born again amen he said if not it's of the world that's right that's right so if you're not born again the nature of your soul is in the world right but if you are born again you're a 19 of your soul it's gone right that's right I see eternal life amen simple language all right but yet though theologians setting their life and it run around the life of me because I was standing in Jeffersonville one day out there Parkview school I know it's the old Armory I'm one of those guys with the two Soul guys was said something and I said what run around said to nature of soul is God if if you're born again if not each of the world he said how can you nature have a nature I said go dig right around him up and talk to him I ain't got time for food that's what I meant I didn't care about talking to him because he's contrary to brother Brown brother Robin said this nature of your soul is God if you're born here that's right if not you know the world that's right do I find the new Mercy has to burn out that nature that's why the Bible called Holy Ghost and Fire you'll notice that in that I believe let's write the book about it Holy Ghost and Fire right they don't mean you get the Holy Ghost and then you get a baptism somewhere else probably explain to Future home reading he said that fire comes in as that Holy Ghost is coming down that Holy Ghost is a fire to burn out ever desire of the world from that soul and leaves eternal life right burns out all that you desire he said well I got born again the next day I was having problems that's where the trouble is that right Nick won't let me quote brother Brown Boy Billy Paul's life another round said she received the Holy Ghost last night you want this one he said she received the Holy Ghost last night and said the day she's doubting it yep sure you say you mean you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Satan can try to make you doubt it's not in the soul that's right that's right but the body and the spirit amen amen when you got bored again did it take care of everything you ain't never had no more truth come on we're still living in a body in the spirit that's in a realm of Satan right amen with his new Creations in the Soul by the new birth all right never born again believer is a new creature see them God's living in you all right man Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh and he turned around telling you his flesh is not worth nothing that's right he turned around and tell you he said by the n-word man I serve the law of God said by the outward man in other words of Flesh he said I serve the law that's right don't run around and explained that he didn't say that Paul was saying it's all right to go out and live like the devil and say I can't hit me you want me to get that one questions and answers conduct order and Doctor run around and explains it Paul was serving the law of the flesh how about around explained how he said I just come in off of the meeting and he said I was tired and wore out in other words he said my body want to go to bed but he said I heard the church and I knew brother Neville would be having Church yeah he said I got up and come that's how he explained Conquering the law of the flesh not that you can't help but sin that's a lie the devil's placed into our minds and our thinking we don't have to do anything and I've always told you how many of those how many times I've ever made just one statement the kid's life about it I'll be telling some joke or something and around they'll say that's the 16th time that he's already told out well how many times have I ever told you I don't blame the devil for everything that's right you say the devil made me do it I don't agree with that we have to volunteer forever sure it might be because of the nature part of it of the devil yes but he didn't make me do everything that's right he tried to make me do a lot of things and he has conquered me in a lot of things and got me to do them amen I'm human what about you all right as quick as you do something amen all right you ever got upset you've been driving down the highway somebody run y'all Brooks people on the road looking more people over there you know you look over the mirror and the guys that were about 55 years old and you called him old and you're 71. but see then you say Lord forgive me right right Forgive Me Lord you ever apologized to anybody because you was right and he was wrong right yeah we're done no bless God if I'm right I apologize to nobody I apologize for offending the man one time you go later he said the man was straightening me out and he was apologizing I wouldn't apologize no I would just tell them I'm sorry that I said something that's contrary to you I preached in a man's church one time or something and he said later he's offended to me I called him up apologize that's not sorry right yeah you know what outrage justifications I told him I said I don't apologize for what I say I said apologize for preaching in your church something I thought you agreed with and come find out you did right right I'm sorry well because that's the nature of my master you do something wrong something immediately gets on to you it's going to repent amen if you don't anymore if you're no good right now watch I know ain't gonna get far so let's just go over this a little bit and then we'll quit look at number five you must be born again 1961 12 31 in the morning service right around 64. now brother sister let me say this as intelligent as I know how to say it how can you think he installs and deny his word now that's a good good doing right right and yet claim you're born again just ask yourself that question how can you do it you can't if you're born again you got his thoughts it's the mind of Christ is in you then you are a new creature the Bible teaches that any brother would like to work you find that creature look that word creature find that that creature with that word creature up in in the Lexicon and you'll find out that the word creature there is interpreted or translated into creation much because you are a you are one creation yep pay close attention because you are one creation I'm watching a human being mourn in sexual desire here on the Earth that's exactly who all of us are Amen brother Brown and all of us yep and now you're a new creationist born by spirit your own thoughts are dead they're so dead until they're Crystal like the bride serpent or like he died when the heavens and the Earth and everything witnessed he was dead the new birth what is the new birth man right to die out to yourself and accept Jesus Christ I don't want to hear these great deep things there's nothing deeper than that all right amen you show me anything deeper than a new birth I preach to see yours I preached 70 weeks of Daniel I preached marriage and divorce I preached all of them but you know where I preaching from the new word amen how many knows this statement of made the way I check a Doctrine is by my new birth that's why I know they can't be two Souls because they're too sold got to be two guards that's him I mean that's just how simple I think you'd have to have two Gods you have too small see that won't work the new birth how can you deny God's word yep no it doesn't mean we know everything right never have taught that I'm constantly learning learning learning learning learning and it all comes from my new birth the new birth makes me a new creature we'll take a right to our Sunday reading where the Prophet says 336 of the church a book that I read last week it's not the old creation made over that's right when he said that's the revelation of one God read through 36 Church movies read the whole page the beginning of the creation of God Amen he said it's speaking of another creation having to do with his pride amen because she's him made up on Earth in a new creation but if you don't get nothing from the message get one thing a new creation means exactly the way it means it is the story of the example of Superman which is nutritional but it gets a good point across he came from another world had superpowers did not our Lord Jesus Christ come from another world amen did he not have superpower right they could not touch him he could just walk out the moon they were fixing to throw him over a cliff one day and somehow right he just walked down yeah they couldn't do anything with him until that anointing left him in the garden to Gethsemane they couldn't do nothing with him they never killed him don't ever put it another Jew killed my savior don't ever put it in a Roman kill myself my sins my sins is what killed my savior that's right man because if he had not died I couldn't believe it right right amen that's right my sins guilty I put him on the cross he died for me amen with no Roman spirit that you'd like he said I have power to call privilege of the language how much is 12 Legions at least 12 000. and one man they had one angel named wormwood destroyed the world of water he said I'm called 12 12 Legions we wouldn't do it amen thank you Lord he didn't do it where I could live amen amen I'm not gonna be a new creature but I don't ever having trouble yes but not in that Soul right because that should leading me to eternal life in this body right imagine and by that then this world will have to be made Eternal because my body comes from this world right his body come from this world so he could redeem all of it sure what do you think about it what is a new creature old things are passed away I gave you the quote it's in there to come back with run around and said William brownham died 32 years ago he used to be a boxer 115 professional fights retired to preach the gospel he said I couldn't stand it my old days he said the old teacher tried to get me the tie knots in a string you know kind of calm myself down he said I start tying knots I throw it down let's go back to five he's a tough little boy you know they've been beat on all his life you got the boxing 115 professional fights but he said now you can lead me around and I've heard people talk about things that they saw with Witnesses that people could take right around and just lick him off and just whatever this whatever you just leave him off he said it's the hardest thing in the world for you to get a meal ticket from him hardest thing in the world for him he wanted to help everybody no matter where you believed with him and talked with him but listen to him last night talking about a former business Minister that he used to have setting the meetings up and you'll find it in there he said I had to fire him but he wasn't on this state he should have found him selling her call he had to fire him but on this day he bragged on him as the greatest man in the world go down and listen to him preach it ain't nobody to preach like him that was brother Brown then Paul said one thing you couldn't tell you could not tell with a brother random friends or his enemies by the way I actually made you couldn't tell which was which by exactly that sure wasn't in the days when he was busting people's nose in he puts it all upon his conversion if this message don't bring a conversion to our hearts we don't need this message right right sure that's right they don't change us and our nature in our way we're in bad shape come on that's right we're in bad shape if it doesn't make a change in US right sure and I want you to make a whole lot more changes we've got a lot of things I need to get rid of I want him to change me but yet I know he's begun work the Bible says and the Bible says he'll finish that word amen that's right amen what do you think about it if we die Christ can live if we keep living Christ can't live that's why people don't receive the new birth right they're afraid you're going to give up too much that's right have you ever heard people say that I just have to quit too many things you don't have to quit nothing to get saved amen just get saved and let God quit I'm really Tom Farm Bush passed away not too long ago even before he heard of this message he used to smoke and he said one day he prayed and he said just like something said he said Lord take away the need and the desire well you know he couldn't say it no better that's right take away the need and the desire right on that cigarette he says young immediately sure Mr Hazel sit over here and play the piano she's had the problem smoking too you say you let her play the piano because one day she got changed right right one day something happened to her that's right right I'm sitting here playing if that isn't love fell over the piano and went on to meet the Lord that's right what greater thing could be a new creation 152 in the red book you might have a name I cared up to they were the moral labor delivery sunshine in Sheltering mode it's related shock people want to order my statements a lot of times oh no he was a son of prediction do I kill Ed do we put it on some kind of a seed or leaning or a doctor told me I'm just not a city what odd with it all not for the ride for

to you foreign just think about it all right think about what he's done for you and I yeah all he's ever asked just for us to just die out in ourselves and let him come and live it is truly an
