father touch each one we love you and we thank you as we read your word and you come and speak to us now in jesus name amen revelations 1 1-3 that we've been reading for a while the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by a record of the word of god you know the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written that are in for the time is at hand what is the time the time to understand we're in the end time so it's time to understand okay revelations chapter six in verse three and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second be say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given unto him that set their own to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and it may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we've got over in our studies and we're dealing now a little bit we're just catching a few points from the the uh seals and the things as they uh unfold unto us and it's a study of the book of revelations and we're trying to see the day and the hour that we're leaving because that's the promise unto us is to find out where we're at that's right all right so that would be the day but you remember now we've been speaking on the first seal which was revelations six one and two and we saw that the rider on the white horse was the antichrist and we read there in the scripture you can read it in verse one and two especially verse two that he had a bow and no arrows so his power was no good or even what little bit he thought he had we know that this antichrist is satan in the teaching ministry or the beginning of the uh you know of his ride because it's the white horse right and as it is then he had no no had a bow and no arrows so he's just a bluffing amen and that's what satan went out in that early church but he did a mighty good job right you know doing it all right but he had no crown see then it was a spirit because you can't crown uh uh uh you know it was it had to be an antichrist because you can't crown a a spirit satan couldn't wear a crown himself there'd be no way that he could put a crown on his his own head because he's not a man like we are right he's not in this form to where that he could be crowned so he had to come to earth and be crowned it's kind of like he done in the garden in the garden he couldn't uh he couldn't inject himself into the human race because he was not a creator amen all right only god can create but he could pervert and vicariously the prophet said or by use of the beast then he was able to you know enter the human race as much as possible not physically but as much as through the beast to produce the beast was what the beast in eve was what was produced cain and then that spirit was the spirit of satan and we'll get back to it at the end of the message but wrote around said these seals they they moved down or moved up he said it's basically the word moved up from genesis because everything starts in genesis so that white horse rider that we talk about the the antichrist you can see that that antichrist started in the garden it started to the deception of being there and you know it captured eve right and allowed the way of satan to be able to um vicariously enter the human race not be able to himself but through the beast he could pervert the whole human race all right then that would write all the way down to the bible i hope that you're getting it that way i hope you're you're listening to what i'm saying right that what we see here and we see it over in our day we can go all the way back right because right around said one seal will tie the entire bible together just one seal too you could preach every scripture in the bible in other words from one seal i know it and i don't know a whole lot but i'm sure i've been at it 47 years of preaching the first seal to you know from genesis because at least i can see that and bring it down but i mean you know bringing it to where we're at all right and as he did see that that spirit went for deceiving the people but once eve done what she done then god could not come down and inhabit the bodies our spirit soul a part of mankind in the old testament because it became perverted all right then he was purely just looking at a time that would come that he would be able to come down himself right and enter into the human race to to change things you know and that would have to be a 4 000 years later for jesus christ to be born but that spirit of satan has deceived man from the beginning amen that's right all right now we'll drop back at the end of the message on this but look at it as in kane when you come over to cain and abel you know we think about that as being maybe just a few days time but it might have been years in developing all right because see that antichrist spirit of satan and i use that because that ties together with the with the antichrist spirit the devil now right he he's in form of the antichrist spirit still writing we'll get get to that in a moment but yet see there in the garden they're right at the edge of the garden you see cain and abel amen all right now you know that abel was trying his best to help came to see the truth right and he was surely telling him that he was born in his mama's blood from his daddy's blood what the problem was well all through life you know you can see them and but yet it didn't develop too much but yet cain he he just couldn't believe that that's right so he believed that it was fruit some kind of an apple like people today thank you some kind of an apple or orange or pomegranate or something and see if he did then that thing just kept building inside of him right and as it built within him he became then as we know the second stages we'll get to it a minute he became then a prophet or a preacher to his doctrine right and he was telling abel you know you're wrong it is not blood you're wrong it's worse real good i'm out here slaving like everything and you're just laying up there watching them sheep you know right now you got to realize they had to be on up in age because they come to the time of offering a sacrifice and you would have done that at 10 years old or whatever so i'm like i'm saying this thing developed over a long period of time right now all right but when it finally developed see then his cane began to tell abel his doctrine then you look at it and see that he finally became incarnate with that doctrine and when he did it just went too far he shed the first blood right because he killed his brother because of his own doctrine that's right you say no no brother dale people are not that bad and they'll kill you today over anytime so you ought to know that you know i mean if you don't if you're blind then you're blind but you all you got to do is pick up a newspaper in the morning and just read how many people in there got killed by somebody that shot them you know whatever it was of killing going on today you can't you can't even turn on a newsreel without it being something about somebody being killed somebody going into school killing a bunch of kids where do you think that comes from what we're going to see tonight because it's the red horse when we get to the symbol and you'll see that he's still riding and he's been riding from genesis that's right that deceiving spirit back there he took everybody and deceived him right amen but the lord jesus christ amen and it became a great religious society how could you lay one thing to the charge of those pharisees how could you condemn them doing wrong they didn't play games back then now you might have all these garbage cans in these convents and all this stuff going on today but they didn't play back there because it was life or death for those pharisees and sadducees right if they didn't keep that word somebody else took their place right you know so it wasn't this plot haphazardly doing it but just kept easing in so slowly until when it finally came down that they started killing they started destroying them as we're seeing them in they started killing for any daughter idea of their own but what's that point of what i'm talking about and don't lose it because we're gonna we're gonna deal in a minute with work that this rider is the same rider on all four horses all right and that's what i wanted you to see see in that first seal that broke to the prophet right that he could see that rider and he would see that writer would do it as it wrote all the way down he said and he's still writing amen he was talking about his day right he sent it right out to eternity all right so don't just think that he gets off of one horse and goes home no the horse is a symbol right right now but the prophet saw that see in the first field that it would be the same writer oh it's been the same devil all the time right all right always been been there he's always been in the form of first deceiving now the devil ain't gonna walk into a church and say y'all fall down worship me i'm the devil no no he don't care how long it takes that's right that's right that's one thing about it he might not have the patience of the statue of a perfect man but the devil's got a lot of patience right cause he don't care how long it takes for him to get a doctrine right embedded in the people right he'll do it with just little bitty sayings that's right well god didn't go down to heaven come on well i got lucifer thrown out of heaven satan adopted the doctrine was that he was equal with god that he was god's right-hand man and he was wanting worship himself see that antichrist spirit started all the way back there and worked his way all the way all down now watch this in the second seal when we come to the red horse and then in your mind just remember that it's killing it's the blood that's what the symbolics is you know man that's why it's red the first one was white the prophet calls it a white righteous church now why would he call it a white righteous church because you couldn't put your finger on it but you realize one time that great mighty church started out on the day of pentecost amen wonderful amen right but after a while it began right right it didn't take no thousand years right there in the book of acts philip just knew how menius was teaching paul had to turn them loose are they the same ones it was teaching that the resurrection was already pious there in the book of acts the prophet said when that when christ went up he said there was judas hanging on a tree that spirit he said but when the holy ghost came back on the day of pentecost he said that antichrist spirit came right back trying to defile the church amen and it wasn't long until he had it defiled amen you say oh no you're getting to the real true bride well that's that antichrist spirit still working okay amen that's right and that offends you if we say it that way amen see if you think that satan is not capable of deceiving you and me you better remember he has deceived everybody right even as i brought out sunday your prophet was deceived right because he thought that white horse rider was a holy ghost right so until those seals broke there was nobody know the truth i don't care who you are i don't mean that derogatory i just made it true i don't care who you are to think what you think this way that way if you wasn't deceived with it we need to be following you instead of brother adam oh my god don't you realize what that devil's doing if you straight and rude around them out like they're doing today and everyone then we need to be following somebody else but i'm not going to turn loose folks you can do what you want to i've done come 40 something years following this message and i can't find no problems with it amen and i challenge that around the world amen come and show me the fallacies show me the wrong show me where he was off but just remember before you come that you're going to walk up to somebody who's going to say boo devil because i'm going to know who i'm talking to you remember i told you about that man that worked down there he said he wouldn't this pentecostal preacher he said i i'm not working on commanding the devil i've got past that i just command the devil he said i'm working on commanding the lord he said you know the bible artwork says command jimmy he said i'm commanding god i never did talk to him no morning i'm honest i'd wave at him hi but we didn't talk anymore why because i was talking to the booger man and i didn't care nothing about talking to him now you tell me no that he was a good man he'd probably give you anything in the world but that spirit had him captivated he was a false prophet to that spirit that had captivated him that he thought he could command god that doesn't mean command ye me that means take my word and believe it and i'll make it manifest that's what it means it doesn't mean command the lord you don't command god but you believe what he says amen and he'll move on the scene that's right i've been seeing it too many times so i don't have to worry about it but now listen see a white righteous church in other words it looks so beautiful we went through it there john admired that church on papers right the scripture said he admired the church if you went back there and looked at those people when jesus walked in there whose side would you have been on oh i'd have been on jesus well why ain't you now oh my whose side are you on now any problems with my stubbornness my bed hard ways of saying thanks and one thing about it prophet said you make it easy they'll thank you trying to deceive them i don't make it easy i just make it plain amen but look whose side would we have been on sorry there was the very seats i don't know why i've got all this off my nose okay there's a little pharisees who was that when the babies were born who was there when the sick was sick who gave them money who blessed them all the time told how wonderful they were and jesus comes in just beating the daylights out of them with a whip of course i'm glad he didn't and i know he didn't he you know who he whipped was the preachers right it wasn't just the regular old laity that he's beating him i i'm glad of that because i've had people arguing with me about daddy so oh jesus didn't hit them but people he beat them animals i said you're worse off man you know what to do with it you make any worse than the bible says goats and things that now don't do with it but listen church see that antichrist has worked its way all the way down that's right and it's still here look at the doctrines among the people of this message now it's moved from little spirits to doctrines right right now come on some of you been in churches now then when i get through with this point you're gonna you've been in churches that told you if you left that church you're out oh maybe not you know in a way not oh they ain't pointing you out no no they taught you that if you left them you left the word now that's beyond the antichrist spirit right that's even beyond the false prophet that teaches the doctrine that's the third stage which is an incarnate false prophet or a pope you ain't never heard this man say if you leave here you've left the word i've never said that about nobody's ever left that's your choice but listen church do you realize that incarnate false prophet that's where we're going to get to in a minute where your coat came into being and there's where your killing started how close is it there's a lot of people in this message that want me dead they're not mean they just wish i'd finally lose my voice and i couldn't preach well i'll eat cough drops till the day i die or something i wonder do you pray for my voice or pray for me to quit sometimes well it's working out sometimes i think you're praying for me to quit maybe we'll learn something from that but the church you'll see in a minute when this thing comes to that incarnate false prophet that's right that's when you start you kill it right yep when a person becomes one with the doctrine they're in you cannot do anything else with them that's right that's right he said god can i learned something a long time ago and two incidences and i'm probably working on the third one now you know i i used to pray god can't you straighten things out when god knew from the bottom of my heart i didn't mean to take the person's life to get it straight i meant straighten up the person right that's right right well you don't want i finally had to do it myself but you better believe i patiently waited for a long time until i had the word of the lord and when i have the word of the lord i'm not afraid of nobody because i'm gonna disbelieve it right until he changes me but see a lot of times you want your argument you won't say well lord can't you work out something maybe you're to speak up right now this is not your women praying that the lord straighten your husband out and give him a good timing spirit yeah i'm not talking about that man that's right we're talking about doctrines not talking about the men praying the lord i wish you'd take that old dominating spirit off of her those things i guess we need to work out ourselves that's right he said well why can't we are you praying need to pray like i told a man you're all back us you need i need the prayer brother and that's it and you need the practice he said you mean you need a prayer i said i didn't say i needed to the practice i said you need to practice me you need to pray but uh you know now listen to watch the seal as it unfolds now and you'll see that it's going into the stage of the pope the second seal see it will turn out to be when the pope got his authority he wrote a decree that was better to serve god by force right than to not serve him at all and by their own records their 68 million people were killed trying to force them to worship now how much of a doctrinal idea do you think it would be that you would get to where you could just cut people's strokes because they didn't believe the way you believed i mean anybody would want out high cents brother you say years ago in order to know better now right now you still brother mo you know i mean i i finally got to work on devil he'd just tell me i'll be driving down the road brother won't be talking about this message boy he'd be laying it on over there and a voice would say to me so just run off the road on his side and hit a tree you say what i'm just telling it like it is you lie because you sweetheart fluffy dovey things you know i just tell it like it is so one day i told him i said brother you know what what's happening right now he said what i said there's a devil trying to tell me around the road and run you into a tree we got a good life out of it we see no no we're sweet love you oh yeah yeah yeah they didn't think jesus was too lovey-dovey when he whipped him preachers would run out right in that church whose side have we been on because we are on the side now we would have been on them right one way or the other okay now let's let's just come down because i'm trying to lay down something but i want it to tie together where you can see something so the first seal as it comes forth it was a church symbol what pure looking everything looked great but inside of it was death that's right i was looking today before i left i should have brought it maybe it's in one of my notes but everyone said it was death from the beginning he said was never was called death until the eagle came that's right amen because it deceived everybody the death that was killing people deceived everybody right so we went through the first seal and saw then the cymbals now remember what i said the white horse rider the writer himself sure that was a mystery nobody knows what that was right but once that first seal opened and brother brattle saw the antichrist then he knew the next rider on the red horse was the same fellow right amen he knew he would not change the writer would be the same because it's not a white guy sitting on a white horse and a red guy sitting on a red horse and a red black guy sitting on a black horse and a pale guy sitting on a pail horse that ain't in your bible that's not that away so the writer once he seen it once he seen that writer he knew whatever he said i don't know what reading i don't know what that second seal is but he knew the writer right sure right he said i don't know what the third fourth fifth but he knew the writer he knew who he's looking at right what i told you and i appreciate the first time i you know you go do it look but see there were some things i brought in the other day that the lord showed me about those seals that after 40 something years preaching them it's still opening right sure right same writer not a different color rider difficult horse all right so once the symbol broke to the prophet the writer was settled but that still it doesn't want the whole full second seal one that's right amen and then show him what the third seal fully was fourth whatever and then you better remember there is no writers after you get on over there to the floor right there's not a there's not a writer on the field right and there's not a combat beast on the field right six or seven right who might reach a book all right it's a great mystery but what that first seal he had a bow and no arrows he started out with no power just sayings right the same it's little bitty things you know them demons up in heaven i think about that a lot you know satan deceived a third of them and they began to say you know i think he's prettier than god is don't you think more to worship him then they started worshiping the devil lucifer the anointed the the morning star the great demon loser and that's just still going on because that's what he's wanting see god created you now for what worship fellowship and do it right right that's what satan wants but see it was just a teaching because there was no arrows he didn't have any crown the bible said there in the first hill and the crown was given to him remember we covered that the other day who gave him the crown the people right once he got control of him once he taught his doctrine so much if you think that ain't right you go find some of these people in some of these doctrines and you say something about their the guy that started their group can you see if they want blood rise up in their eyeballs right amen all right see a false prophet we found out what is one who teaches what the antichrist spirit is saying you remember that we brought it out from the prophet a false prophet then so what did it happen phillips and hymenius in them started out they had become one with an antichrist spirit so they were teaching the resurrection was already passed you know where they were getting their doctrine from paul sure yep exactly right yep all right what paul was teaching the spiritual resurrection had already taken place in the new verb they took it on over to the physical brother around them preaching what he was preaching into eternal life inside of us and that that would one day bring this mortal under subjection right to the one within i'm not going to call his name but a man went out preaching immortality in the flesh claimed he wasn't going wouldn't get an older let his hair grow out and combed it around to cover up the bald spots somebody said something to brother branham he said he gets the tapes he's heard the message man what about the country still got followers after him passing on as far i know he's passed on but you see when truth is presented there will always be antichrist demons follow that truth to pervert it that's right because that's what's always happening man you see when somebody starts preaching come on if i won't swap places with me but i stand here and preach i've been in 40 something years with preaching to you no one didn't realize if i tell you a lie if i mislead it purposely right i don't have no place in heaven i got no sense to realize that knowing if i try to deceive you with something i don't have no hopes to go into heaven you won't swap places with it that's right and realize that you've got a group of people depending upon what you're saying have no problems i didn't call myself i'd sure like to quit that's up to him i preached my last message he can take care of everybody until then i'll start trying to help i still try to hammer the truth but see when a man becomes one with a spirit he'll start preaching what that spirit is saying and that makes him a prophet i'm quoting from the first seal read you see a book i've asked you to but how many of you have read the seal i mean have you read the first seal how many are going to go home now read the second seal right just to come to me a while ago and said brother dale said once you've preached y'all did all that you're gonna wait on that daniel 70 weeks he said i went back and got my book and started reading and said that drawing that brother brown was talking about is right there in the word i said that's exactly what it's supposed to be he was the prophet all right see that's the way it's supposed to be you're supposed to go home and do the studying i'm studying to preach right not studying to do it and if you want me you said well brother dale tell me what to do read the seal book one more time read to see a book that's where i'm preaching from i'm sorry all right if you're in college and walk in and that's professoring is anything i can do to help me get better grades he'd say just go home and sit down and fold your arms and forget it i'll take care of it well i'll get out of there with you because you know that ain't gonna work they're gonna sign something for you to read i ain't got time stay out of walmart you have time come on church is time to just get it or get out this is death amen that white horse rider was death to start with but nobody knows what it was right nobody noted until that eagle come when he came he knew it was death so let's follow it see a false teacher of a false doctrine becomes a false prophet all right see then we was covering our last this past sunday for not strong wednesday before excuse me okay a crown was given to him a crown was given unto it the people gave him a crown right one a triple ruling crown what about a man that could just take the bible yeah make it say what he wants to and then people believe there's no such thing as purgatory but because he said it was now listen folks i got it written in here somewhere so if i repeat it's all right the first pope that was crowned he didn't go out and have people killed they didn't believe what he believed saint augustine i believe is a hippo with 1500 or something a lot of them folks were good people you know what they were bishops elders of the early church i gave you the quote last week was brother ryan said 300 years later so that would have been somewhere around 325 upwards going to 350. if you'd be everywhere he would want to calculate to start from the book of acts or whatever they crowned the pope but you know those guys were good people right they wasn't killers because he had to be as an antichrist if they had crowned the first boat he walked out anybody difference me or dead when everybody would have left him right no had to get him tied to him right so he started a doctor doctrine of purgatory now you know and we have a sister sitting here that was catholic for a long time and i'm not against them no problems he just types fighting stating truth they didn't start right out with these false doctrines it took a quite a while to get these doctrines of going mary the mother of god appeared about 3 41. and then it didn't even appear as being the mother of god et cetera like they would bring it today but it was entered into the nicean creed in about 341. the first thing i see in greek states emphatically jesus was god almighty god and no other god and no other substance most of you wouldn't even ever you've never read it most of the preachers in this message they preach about not seeing they never even read anything about it go read the book well i'll just take my brother brother said program said start out 325 a.d what started at 325 a.d the only thing they've done at the nicean council of the 325 a.d was injected a seed a antichrist spirit that jesus was a light substance it was 606 before they changed the water baptism come on get what i'm saying that first crown pope was a good guy it took a while before the bad eggs begin to appear even though he was already opposed but his first thing was to do was establish a purgatory catholic doctrine all people go to hell priest pope whoever he is he's going to purgatory we use the word hell to show gohan hades there's many meanings for the word hell and everybody that dies gotta go there you know why now why would he create that thing you know what i mean he created it didn't he he created it in the minds of the people come on he didn't create purgatory come on me don't be carnal with me i'm carnal enough as it is he in their minds created a purgatory right that their family went to and then what do you do pay money to get them out of it right right well then you can't leave the cabin at church do you get mama out of hell money scheme right right but it's a big control scheme that's it controlling the mind for the people until they become so captivated by the antichrist spirit until it becomes a doctrine within them right and they go by and they do the signs and the different things to a piece of bread laying on an altar that rats is running over all night we call it the body of god it deceived martin luther until god spoke to him come on but it took a long time before the pope got his final triple ruling crown he didn't start out with it at 325 a.d even he didn't get it at 606. i don't know exactly when they did crown him that part but the run said they crowned him about 300 years later right but even when they crowned him a pulp he didn't start out as a devil killing right you had to wait until a pope would sign a decree that's believing he was in god's stead and could say what god said see a crown was given to him the crown was given by the people that man wouldn't sit down there come on i don't care he's sitting up on the throne and here comes a crown down out of heaven now i ain't that dumb i hope you ain't the people gave him the crown right the people put the crown on him who crowned david king of israel oh it was the people see they gave him the crown that crown i told you there last wednesday that crown was not given of god that crown was given a man the power didn't come down from god for the devil to be able to work through man to kill all of 68 million sure we know it was allowed right it was allowed to come into being but not giving them god god never made no hail or nothing like that he said he made it through the devil's anger the other lane destroyed but see he was given a triple ruling crown ruler over heaven and earth in purgatory to rule with go ahead brother anderson pull up number one some of these we had them before so we'll just read them again what was it when it comes to crowning time then you become the false prophet of the santa cruz teach it get it then he gets a sword because he unites his powers together then you don't have to ask nobody he's governor of the state he's governor of heaven receives a triple crown makes himself an idea called purgatory or if some of them die back there and they got some money they want to pay them out he can pray them out of it because he's got the power to do so he's a biker certainly he is he takes the place of god on earth if that ain't as plain as anybody we find it pull it on down through the bible and count his new numerical numbers and everything else here he is play him up back here in the number four not number three number four huh what is he bringing down to the bible right 666 vicarius philly idea which is written over the triple rule and crown of rome take that down into roman numeral number one say the numeral number that's right and it comes out to be 666. that's right well brother down your name might be 666. don't bother me if it is al can remember we'd get some gas one night i pumped in the gas turned the pump off turn around he said brother dale i put in another penny look at the flop the 666. i just laugh like everything your name might be numerical numbers of 666 but you don't sit on earth right thrown and rule the world so that takes care of that problem i don't either right so if you took billy graham and made his name 666 or roberts or whatever it wouldn't make no difference he's not the triple ruling crown of rome right all right but you see then you bring him down to that who is he look the next one that was program 162 the fourth seal this is paragraph 301 of the first seal notice when nicoletti the antichrist is finally he's incarnate of the man then he's crowned when he starts off as a nicholaity of spirit in the church i'm secured in the church he's a spirit you can't crown a spirit but 300 years later he'd become a pope and then they crowned him he had no crime to start with but he got a crown later see when that spirit became incarnate see he become a man look now you got a man that's the man of sin sitting in the temple of god lady and doctor and become a man then he could cram it they couldn't do it because it was just a doctrine see abel had a doctrine of the blood cain had a doctrine of fruit and works works especially if you'd call it i've even heard preachers in this message and you have to even in this church try to preach that the bible says that abel's offering was more excellent than cain reading genesis so with garba kane's offering must have been excellent abel's was more excellent i just thought myself what are you dealing with you mean it would be all right to do what cain done to go to heaven that represents works right need to be leaving the blood of jesus christ out of your doctrine i said i don't like that idea of course it didn't make me popular with a brother that said it and i couldn't help it father come your enemy because i told you the truth listen church he was crowned when the people give it to him the head false prophet now you know it's the way i said that because that's what it would work out to be because it was coming down through the the prophets to those fault systems and then they finally made a bishop you know to be over the doings and then they would make like an overseer or something your ranks would grow everybody would be and it finally came down to one man and then they got together and elected now i guess a tickle today you know they they tell them cardinals i reckon that's a good in cardinals and they all get together they vote on who's going to be god all right they do it's not just one name in the pot right right you're right there's a lot of names in the park then they vote right on who's gonna be god okay like i said i ain't that far off the head false prophet see the head guy finally became the crown pope right they elected him and made him a pope all right then the cardinals since that time they've come down see church most people don't even read like the nicean councils and pronunciation councils and there's all kind of councils with hell the the writings that i have in my briefcase right in there shows you that they even count the fact that when i told you about it the other day when when uh james was trying to convince him there in the book of acts that to call on them that they needed to get needed to circumcise them people them gentiles before them come in they call that a council meeting they call that a nicely in meeting there were hundreds of nicean meetings held before 325 a.d what's the hard part of it or the odd part is that 325 a.d was called by the roman emperor the roman emperor called the 325 a.d come on ring a little bit um at the next one regret 155 and 158 of the fourth seal see the writer in the first place as an antichrist he was deaf to begin with you remember that while going i was quoting it but he's innocent then didn't receive the crown the triple one and when he did then he united satan unites his church and state because he was over both of them antichrist was satan in form of a man going down to a pope you remember what i said the fir the 325 a.d was called by the roman general roman emperor that's when you brought in the governmental side before then it was a church system then it became a governmental system he started giving them all kind of things buildings and all kinds huh and it also signed that to you i believe it is the fourth chapter and what's it tells us that satan took jesus our lord up and showed him the kingdom to the world all of them in a moment of time and and the glory of them offered them to him and he said that they were his brothers said jesus never argued with him now this stuff belongs to satan all of these good i don't care where's romney obama who i already and i told you the other day what you want to do is back to pope be the president of the united states to get this thing to go but listen so you see then if you can unite it if he can unite his state and his church together then the red horse rider could ride sure enough now watch if it hadn't been constantine and the romans you know the romans came in and started doing and it became the roman catholics it became all those things they couldn't have started killing the people right the government would be against it you take a gun today and just walk down the street and go all right the devil god told well they're gonna put you in jail because the law is gonna get you right but the law's on your side and said it's all right for you to do that right then let just let you go you had to wait until you got church of state to come together that's right that's what i said those folks down through there wasn't too bad until they got together with the state and then when they got together with the state what happened okay well number four we've done read this before but i have 160. now i want you to notice before them notice the off mark before the spiritual mathematics god is threes this is four it's almost satan he's in four here first antichrist white right first antichrist white more second false prophet red that's putting horses and everything together right third watching bikers of heaven and earth and purgatory black deterioration now what's the likes fourth excuse me third fourth is the beast the pale horse and he can't happen until we get out of here in the rapture all right now he talks about in the next one that we've been through she'll pull it up and you can sit there and read on it a little bit i got 184 number five a savings trinity same person coming just incarnate from one to the other that's the way them bugs did now you know what the bugs are can't work worm locust caterpillar that was the bugs that was what ate it down joel said that's what i ate it down through the church nicolette what now watch it spiritual antichrist pope false prophet beast the devil himself becomes incarnate in that beast all right now so let's just take a little bit just for a minute i don't know ain't gonna get done let's just take a little bit go ahead number six pull it up i'll try to be hurry now the lamb is standing tonight as we enter into the sixth chapter he's got the book in his hand and starting to reveal it i notice that's on the first field oh i would have absolutely today and i hope that people are spiritual i would have had a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something that i was writing down to say now that's what i told you well ago he was deceived until the seal broke to him now that's what he's saying right all right i was taking it from old context i had nothing on it i don't know what the second seal is no more than nothing no but i got some old contacts and he talks about around 12 o'clock the whole spirit swept down in the room and the whole thing just opened up to me and there it was the first seal being open go ahead to the next quote this is on the third seal all right last night we found out the same rider that rode the white horse was the same one on the red one the voice said in the midst of the beast called out see come see what it was he was in his living creature all right and he saw his black this black horse the voice tells his measure a week for penny now we won't get to that the main thing i want you to see is right up here white horse red horse all of it is going to be the same one rider then we'll get back to the seal part all right go ahead to the next one number eight i got 273. so i ain't writer now his first stage he was innocent and second now he went a little bit higher a little bit more than that in the second stage the bible said he'd be given a crown and they crowned the man the superman city crowned him and then the bible didn't call him a pope the bible don't call the beast of hope the prophet called him a pope right right now that's right the bible don't call him that because you didn't know all about it that's right i mean if they come out there in the bible says now the pope is the antichrist you know that thing that come out the other day you better look down at the bottom of it and see when the dates of that is that thing didn't come out the other day it came out in 2009 why has it been kept so secret if it's true that's why i'm not touching it until it's fully enough maiden on because the the date on the bottom of it is 2009. you mean this thing's been there him saying that for all that time and ain't nobody said nothing about it but i said i'm going to leave it alone some of you don't know what i'm talking about that's good don't worry about it because it'll burn you enough until you nag me and i'll tell you someday but that's all right look the bible called him a false prophet why yeah of course he must be a false prophet by his antichrist spirit that thought antichrist against the original word because if you taught against the original word it was that christ and the word is god see the christ all right just prove it a point going down number one number ten nine he vindicates his word third seal and brings it they know they knew they rise again oh how i like that we they'll rise again here comes the black horse rider now dark horse there went to white horse we've seen what he done perfectly here comes the railroads we see exactly what he's done here comes the black horse you see the same writer all the time what's he doing writing down through the ages right writing down through the ages number ten four seal last night we had the opening of the and the third seal first was a white horse next was a red horse then a black horse and we found out the writers were the same writer all the time and that was the antichrist to start with you know no crown that was given unto him and all that let's see if i can find the one looking for it what is it then but i better stop here i'll go in with further i'll be going on the end of what i want to bring but what is it same writer the same writer the devil he don't change colors right he's the same devil now listen he was called the antichrist but he was the devil next he was called the false prophet he's the devil next he's called the pope but he's the devil the pope is not the devil personification of standing there in human flesh as we would talk about our human flesh right right right that's why he can die and go to the next guy die and go to the next tower right it's the devil all the way through and the devil's not a man that's right this morning i don't want to go to prophecy he was a man but he's not a man like this that's right he's the anointed cherub no man is a match for him the holy spirit is the only one that's a match for the devil he's deceived every man has ever been in the world outside the lord jesus christ and that deception was removed as a part when the holy ghost came and i would say part of what i mean part when that holy ghost came on the day of pentecost satan lost his main power he found out he couldn't get in man so he started setting up to the bases he's going to kill the man he's the same writer amen the horse changes colors because the white was the righteous church the red will be the killing right the black is the doctrines and purgatories etc and heaven ruling i mean uh ruling over heaven and earth and the lights will be the beast it's the same old devil amen same old devil that's right he's not a man he's not a human being you can be called a man because you're talking about him as a man of what he's doing right but he's not a human being do you agree that's right amen so he has to enter man so in the first seal he entered man and received a crown under the first seal that the crown was given unto him read your bible he became a crowned pope under your first seal an antichrist spirit to a false prophet to a crown pope all right that's your symbols of the wireless rider right and the white horse excuse me and the bow with no arrows and the symbol of a crown was given him but when you come to the second seal let's read it over again we'll take just a minute verse four and there went out another horse that was ready once and power was given to him that set their own to take peace from the earth now that had to be permitted of god because he has no power but he permitted it right because of what he was going to bring to place once sit there on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill with one kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword he started riding to kill let's just go let's go ahead let's pick it up go ahead with number 11. i'll go just for a little bit and then quit i don't want to tire you but i want you to point the story number 11. now let's go to the second seal when the slain prison line opens up like come see what you see the lamb you remember has to open ever seal and run around and open the seals that's right the lamb opened the seals all right go to the next twelve all right now to my understanding this is to my understanding this great sword it had in his hand now we got about three things to look at now for about the next 15-20 minutes let's just read and see what he says now he reads this scripture is given unto him a great sword and there are symbols here and we want to look at them real close but to my understanding the best that i know now you see jesus predicted the same thing in matthew 24 and he said now you're going to hear wars and rumors of wars and just wars and rumors of wars and wars you're going to keep hearing oh no all the way down through there because that's what it's going to be that's what it's going to be because that's what he's doing wars he's giving power look at the next one and here's my revelation he's the second seal so we're just reading this is satan again it's the devil again and another form now the hershey writer what now what's he do it and we know that that seal pertained i said the other night trump is pertaining to civil war amongst the people among nations but you find out here that this man has a sword choice pertains to church political war church political now you might not think that but just watch it a minute just a few minutes notice the change of the color of these horses sane rider color off change of color of horses horse is a beast and beasts in the bible is symbolic the same system riding on another color power went from instant white to red go to the next the council was held and they elected the head bishop and by doing this they united church and state together and i said that one go but i want you to read it church and state is when you come together for the killing not because he just started out a pope it takes time once then he dropped his bow no i think you know no errors anyway but he dropped it he got off his white horse and he got on his red course or he can kill anybody that don't agree with him after what church and state right come on oh my god watch him go right on him to eternity you underwood unites both his powers together the same thing they're trying to do right now go ahead to the next is from the second seal program 287 289 now brother level you and your teachers you and you teachers here i'm not seeing any age in the early church i don't know if you read this or not if you want to read it you get in smucker's glorious reformation you find it that when saint augustine of hippo became a priest under the roman church watson had the opportunity to at one time the holy spirit tried to come on him do you mean he tried to come on him and he didn't have it i need to stop right there and preach about three hours that's why when you come down here to pray and you're gonna be praying for the baptism in the holy ghost i don't want somebody down here shouting all around you and screaming and hollering and patting you on the back and hollering and telling you turn loose and let go or whatever i want your mind on god because you can drive the holy spirit away that's right does that explain what he's saying did not judas iscariot have an opportunity to receive the baptism of the holy ghost come on no no no no because he doesn't know he had it but he killed his own self before he went to pentecost to zeus coming to the upper room right now if you don't believe it listen i just stopped there to express that the man had an opportunity to receive the holy spirit even tried to come on and he rejected it watch what happened to him how many knows that as a teacher so he rejected the holy spirit so if he rejected the holy spirit he must of thought he already had it that's why i said i didn't have time to preach the message come on he must have thought he already had it he rejected it you're reading your prophet not me now we're going to read the rest of it he must have thought he already had it how many of you do not think you already got it i've seen a lot of people that told me they had the holy ghost but when the word was presented they turned it down i can't believe they got it when they turned down the word but they got mad at me and told me won't come here to church and i told him he didn't have the holy ghost no i didn't i did not i said i don't believe in anybody with a holy ghost act like you do you say well that's the same thing no it wasn't i put it back in his laps whether he had it or not right because i can't tell you whether you've got it or not i'm the only one in this building that i know has got the holy ghost all right i don't know if anybody else in here has got it right because i'm the only one that's got the personal experience right you said what do you mean i mean you've got to say the same thing come on are we quoting the prophet he said if i don't be one out of georgia i'm going right y'all better find you another state because i'm going but now brother right you got to go to another state let's see turn around brother damn i believe you're going to make it but i don't know about myself but then you don't have it right come on you know let me stop preaching stop start preaching them you let me read quotes but do you know whether you're born again or not that's right and upon what basis do you put it what if it would be that the words you hear would determine whether or not you could receive the holy ghost right give me scripture the disciples heard the word they took it and held it and the holy ghost came on 120 when jesus was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection didn't get there come on mathematics 380 didn't make it something was wrong they didn't have the word planted right or something amen brother brown said god will give the holy ghost to the person that's got an honest and sincere heart so evidently this guy didn't have one why because he thought he had it you said that's your assumption well what's yours come on what's your assumption what do you think it is why didn't the holy ghost come on the main you tried to pull it back up really had the opportunity until one time the holy spirit tried to come on him and he rejected and he knows that as a teacher so he rejected the holy spirit that's exactly what a type of the protestant church today that's rejected the holy ghost now that's what he said what happened then to this man that done that he went back down to hippo and he was the very one that signed that paper that had the revelation from god that it was all right and pleasing god to put every person to death that didn't believe with the roman catholic church but yet he turned down the holy ghost he said god told him that now listen i'm quoting from waterology from the time of saint augustine of hippo until 1586. so in there somewhere he was a 500 something remember whatever you want to call the dark ages or whatever you want to deal with i don't know on the roman modernology roman catholic church put 68 million protestants to death was his sword read was he riding the red horse what was it the same power the same writer narcissiel they admit 68 million on the moderator beside all those put to death outside of that and mercy during the dark ages there were millions fed the lions and slaughtered in every way because they wouldn't bow down to that catholic dogma what about a church what about it but could we turn down the holy ghost and they're trying to come upon us no brother damn i cried and i prayed i laid my older and i fasted so did i for two years well i just take it because i'm in the message i believe the prophet i don't mean this wrong with this good point come to little and sit down a little while find out whether you believe the message or not you know all right come and sit down a while see whether you believe the truth or not it's like we finished the other day our sunday on the daniel 70 williams putting together everything the prophet had to say about it well i just don't believe it your way what about a church go to the next let me get this a couple more 16 17 18 on the arm second seal notice they should kill one another and they should kill each other his bow had no urge at first but his great sword did he done his killing later change from black horse to a red horse the same exactly devil with his swords keep coming back to me so i'll make sure to put it on here i was quoting while ago thinking that saint augustine came in at 15 something saying augustine came in before 15 something it was up to 15 something that they've done to kill it all right see i want to keep that straight because somebody come along and say he don't know what his ages are well okay i do know enough of the holy spirit to bring it back to me amen what did jesus say today that take the sword will perish by don't fight back you remember judas you remember all of them in the garden you remember peter yeah when he grabbed the sword he only won the crowd peter had it he cut off the man's ear jesus picked the year put it back up on him he said you take the sword you will die by look jesus that night when he told said that and peter took his sword and just just like he did just just go ahead now remember he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding red horse wading through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now do you understand it how many understands what that seal is do you understand it what's the next one they take the sword without will be slain by the sword they took the sword of dogma and antichrist and cut down the real true worshipers all down through the ages by the millions and when christ comes with his with a sword for his sword that proceeds out of his mouth he will slay every enemy there is before him you believe it he's killed him all right let's get some likes on this two more he says these are correct so we'll get to life's part there's the second seal he says said the lord if i'll go to the next number 18 for it and then we'll quit listen what he said if i only had time i'll try a few places to show you all this is on the seventh seal priesthood 63 324 the evening service i'll show you all the way back from genesis this seventh chapter once this seventh seal is spoken from the very beginning in genesis the seventh all right this is heaven seal watch these seals moved right up so it started back there so what happened with cain and abel came killed abel because of his doctrine somebody brings a doctrine to you you get mad and upset oh what kane you got a problem right that's right don't let it go too far you ain't to tell me i believe the prophet's message well well and good but so does the devil believe every word run around said he knows a whole lot more about it you and i do that's right became killed abel there was your first blood that started and set a stage to work that it would come down through there and it wouldn't be nothing but the prophet said wars and rumors of war throughout the old testament it was wars and wars and wars and wars and war brother tom he said no more war stories that's what he said because you'd read them david killing what was david's problem the reason david couldn't build a house come on says you've shed too much blood that solomon will build him your house been in the blood always been in the blood it's been killing all the way down right fighting and murdering just slaughtering even here in america the war between the states lost more americans but both sides were americans right more americans killed and ever been killed in any kind of war and they're just shooting bullets at each other in cannons and stuff i was thinking about it when he talked about over in israel the value of what is it it says the blood will run to the bridle's mouth of a horse you lay the horse on the ground it would take a lot of blood running i mean lay a horse on the ground what if you stood it up all right my brother dean and sister and my wife peggy and myself we were standing there and i thought about that one place has been destroyed and rebuilt 20 sometimes i thought how much blood has been shed in this valley all right millions of millions of people slaughtered over all those years in that one valley if you had all of that blood there at one time and that valley is not no little old biggie thing you stand over in one side in the middle of it and you see either side and 12 miles is your limitations divide and it gets pretty thin going out on each side ain't no little bitty valley it's a big monstrosity of a valley but you put all of the blood that never been shed in that valley you bring it back at one time they run real deep in church the word is what's right right a red horse killing destroyed governmental power given to a pope brought him into a being that he could kill what about all of the obedience that he's killed with his doctrine right you see the second seal that's why it's a red horse and that's why he's able to take power was given to him to take control of the earth and to kill with us every war that's ever been fought is over some form of a religious matter whether it be between iraq and iran or what it be right or whether it be here in america when we're fighting our own brothers brothers on either side shooting and killing each other same thing that happened in the garden but they're at the edge of it with canelo that red horse has been riding ever since that's right and it'll ride right down through here and kill all that's left which you see the last battle is going to be the lords are they that take the sword or die by come on god's gonna take the sword and wipe this whole thing off okay all right it'll be a lot of blood but what about it the whole point see that i needed to spend a lot of time on do you know whether or not you held the holy ghost right right could you reject it what is the doctrine of most of the people of this message now i ain't saying everybody you know that what's the biggest portion of the doctrine of people this message about the baptism in the holy ghost if you believe brother brown was a prophet you got the holy ghost now that's their doctrine that's not mine i said that's of the people of the message if you believe brother brown was a prophet you believe you got the holy ghost well what else brother dale can i believe the word the prophet brought he come to straighten out the the fallacies not make more amen that's right you know what i was just saying while ago was right a lot of you've left churches and come here when you know that it was said you left the word when you left that place and if you left that word you didn't have no hopes of being saved i didn't know my brother said that don't be blind don't be blindfolded be honest and say lord help me amen i told you this what how many thousands of times i'd rather go through life seeking the baptism of the holy ghost every day of my life i seek god for more of him every prayer i pray lord is more of you i'd rather seek god all my life find out when i get down to the end of it because he said well you had it all alone then just not seek him at all and get down to the end of the road and him say depart from me i never knew you people laid hands on me and told me said brother dale i believe you got the holy ghost that wasn't enough for me i had to have my own experience that's right something satan can't argue about and where i know where i stand what about you go ahead let's stand together 277 in springfield switch every seven or seven you might have a knee the altar is over and i know it is oh please is without a doubt oh is oh me we holy spirit me 360 greater receiving that is is take care of us is greater is
