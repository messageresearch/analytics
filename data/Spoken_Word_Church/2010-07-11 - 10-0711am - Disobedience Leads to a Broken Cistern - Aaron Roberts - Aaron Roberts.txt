what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain neither said they where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt that led us through the Wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through where no man dwelt and I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof and when ye entered ye defiled my land and made my in Heritage an Abomination the priest said not where is the Lord and they have handled and they that handled the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophesied prophesied by Baal and walked after things that do not profit wherefore I will plead with you said the sayth the Lord and with your children's children will I plead for pass over the aisles of sham and sea and send them to gadar and consider it diligently and see if there be such a thing hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit be astonished oh ye Heavens at this and be horl horribly afraid be ye very desolate sayith the Lord for my people have committed two evils for they have forsaken me the Fountain of Liv Living Waters and heue them out sists broken ssts that can hold no water amen Lord bless the word this morning you may be seated and uh yall just pray for me I speak a little bit on the on the life of on Jeremiah and the condition of of Israel and then there's many scriptures you can refer to in the uh in the in the book of Jeremiah when you speak of of Jeremiah's life and we we understand that uh Jeremiah came 60 years roughly 60 years after Isaiah and Isaiah and this is from the this is from the message broken sisters and sistens and brother brandom says and now during the time of Jeremiah here his prophecy it had been about 60 years since the death of Isaiah and they had been about 60 years without a major prophet there was a back and some of the small Minor Prophets but Isaiah was the last major prophet and the people had during this time had no no one to call them out and they had drifted yet they were God's people and have drifted into this state now that we find them as Jeremiah came to prophesy to them and Jeremiah also was he Pro prophesied before the Exile and also went into Exile with them now we know that Jeremiah Was came in a time when they had no there was no uh Prophet major prophet to bring them the word to bring them to a place and they had drifted away from God and we we know that um Jeremiah Was A was a man and you know the the amazing thing that we all people always speak of about Jeremiah even brother R speaking of Jeremiah Was that in chapter one you know this is the when God come and spoke to Jeremiah he said before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations so Jeremiah was already called and brother bam said even Jeremiah Was was just like all the other prophets Jeremiah didn't want to be a prophet he tried to run from it just like Moses tried to run from his calling but he was still still ordained a prophet and he also said Jeremiah also God speaking to Jeremiah also says see I have made this day set thee over the Nations and over the kingdoms he says to root out to pull down to destroy to throw down to build and to plant see when when Jeremiah came there was a work for him to do but it wasn't all destruction the destruction came because that's what the people wanted right it wasn't it wasn't his fault Right Said see the calling he had the calling to call the people back to the word and that's what he was wanting him to do and you know you start to read through the book of Jeremiah and I always keep coming I always kept coming back to the book and I kept trying to find what you know just get my mind on something from the Lord and I just kept coming back to this this one chapter and you start looking at at Jeremiah's life and here's Jeremiah calling to the people trying to call them back and it says that you know he called day and night before the people and you know he had a you know it's a very thankless job when you look at all the things that Jeremiah was trying to do to the for the people right because you know when he and one of the reason I I chose chapter too I just come back to this because here it is when many times or different times you'll see Jeremiah referring back to the fathers that he brought them out of the land of Egypt and when he calls them when he calls their attention back to the land of Egypt and he speaks and he goes back in different times he'll talk about the land of flowing with milk and honey and he goes back and as we've said spoke on before see when God come before the people and spoke to them he said show me where I have have failed because he said when I talk to your fathers about the land flowing with milk and honey see they couldn't put a finger against God that God had failed them that God had lied to them had done anything wrong against them right but it was the people had walked away from God and so when he comes back and he talks about even those who handled the law see they knew the word but they had walked away from it right but see you know and you know it's just like when you go back before into the Old Testament you and you look when they built the ark of the covenant What was the Ark of the Covenant for it was a testimony against the people right because he gave them the two tables of stone it had the Mana and had the rod that budded and each one of them and you go back and you read in the scriptures every time it talks about the Ark of the Covenant and it talks about each one of talks about the Mana see they God fed them he you know and they were the ones that said we loathe this light bread but it was Angels food they hated it right but it was God fulfilling the promise just just as the Apostle Paul tells us he talks about he said they all walked under the cloud right they all have walked under the pillar of fire right he said each one of them he said they all drank from that spiritual rock that water that came out of the Rock right and he said that was Christ he said because when they when they were thirsty he gave them water when they when they were hungry he fed them right that's right and when you go back and see and he had that pot of Mana there in the in the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the testimony why because it was a testimony against them right that they stood there because when they when they said where is God and they walked away from him but he stood there and was showing them that he was true and faithful to his word and so there he was and he had the Mana and the rod that budded to show God was leading them amen when he called when he was calling a group of men one of the tribes to be into the line of the high priest all right to be in the the priesthood he called him and the rod budded showing that Aaron's Aaron's group the Levites would be the ones that were in the priesthood right and when they stood against them and they died because that's what God done because of their murmuring and complaining and standing against the word and when they were consumed then they come back the next day you know they didn't come right back after after they were all consumed they waited a while and then they come back and told and told Moses and accuse Moses of killing God's people right right and what had happened it was them standing against the word right amen now why didn't they why didn't they just stand up right then and go against Moses and and speak of about what Moses had done right at that time when God was moving see they were so afraid that God when God was on the scene yeah but they you know then walked away and then they had to come by and accuse Moses but see each one of those each one of those things that was in the Ark of the Covenant was a testimony that God kept his word right you know I love that song and I don't I don't know if y'all know it y'all y'all might have y'all might know it but greater Vision has a song and it's called with all these many miracles I don't I don't know if y'all if y'all know it or not but you know I love that song because you know when it go when it goes through that song it talks about all these things that God has done right and you know if you look at all the things that God has done and if he's and if he's been faithful all the way through then how can we not have faith with all these many miracles when you look all the way through the Bible it talks about all the many miracles that the Israel the children of Israel being on their journey and him walking them through right and all the things that they faced and he met their need and met their need and then it comes to you know with all these many miracles and it you know talks about so you face a problem you think you cannot overcome but you've seen him come through all these different times then how can you stand there and say you know how can you not have faith and believe that's right with all these many miracles and you know that's the way it is this morning with all the many miracles see we don't have we don't stand up and we don't Proclaim and don't claim what's ours and so we stand here and and we're below our Privileges and we see that the that the children of Israel were the same way right because he's speaking this morning he said BL they have hewed them out sisters right Y and you know another fascinating anal I may bounce around a little bit this morning but I'm just trying to say what's on my heart this morning right one of the things about the book of Jeremiah I doing some doing some study and everything doing some reading do you know that the word obey obey any form of obey obeyed obeys whatever it's more it's used more in the book of Jeremiah than anywhere else in the Old Testament the word obey and it's used I think U it's used over almost half as many times as it is in in the whole new testament and so it's it's the one thing about Jeremiah that's that's what he talks about obey they've not obeyed my voice you go to you go to Jeremiah 11 excuse me we may get get there in a little bit but that's all he talks about obey my voice obey my voice obey obey and that that's the whole that was the whole concept the whole point of Jeremiah writing was obey was obedience that was that was the whole point and here he is he's speaking all the way through and trying to bring them the people to God trying to show where the where they need to be right in Jeremiah chapter 7 verses 22 and here and here's one of the times where they're speaking of the children of Israel and the fathers verse 21 says thus sayi the Lord of hosts the god of Israel put your burnt offerings un your sacrifices and eat flesh for I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that brought that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burn offerings or sacrifices but this thing commanded I them saying obey my voice and I will be your God and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you that it may be well with you but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward since the day that your father came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have sent I have even sent unto you all my servants and Prophets Rising day daily rising up early and sending them right so here here he is he's speaking of obeying my voice and so he's speaking of even in in times past and he's and telling them see he's going pointing back because because God had a track record with them and they had a track record right and he knew what they had done and they knew what he had done right but he stood there and said listen obey my voice he said look he said when ever since I've brought your your fathers out of the land of Egypt see they they wanted to be a spiritual group right and even even a part of Jeremiah gets into it because there was a very religious group right they wanted to they burnt their offerings they offered their their sons they burnt their incense see they they were very religious but he said it wasn't he wasn't he wasn't interested when he spoke to the fathers in times past it wasn't all about burnt offerings and sacrifices he said it was about obedience right see that was the whole thing even when you go back to the day of Saul being King see that was the whole thing about that it God was not interested in the burnt offerings right when when Samuel came to Saul and told told him because when he told him to go down there to AAG and to kill everything not to leave anything there was not supposed to be anything left but to utterly destroy it and he said does God have great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices what because he said he said that obedience is better than sacrifice because he said he said Disobedience Rebellion is is as of witchcraft and idolatry right he said see to get just to do utterly destroy all of that right because see it was more it was more important to be obedient amen than to be anything else and there he is when he was when he went down there and see then because of what he had done when what Saul had done being disobedient right that's right because he got in his own mind his own counsel his own imagination as Jeremiah was telling them right here see they walked in their own imagination and see because he done that see God told Sam Samuel to tell Saul he said I pulled the Kingdom from you he said you will no longer be king he said because I raised one up who is better than you see there he was and here's here's a little a little man on the back side of the desert watching sheep here's the greatest man in the Kingdom Head and Shoulders taller than anyone else the man that everybody looked up to and he said there's a little Shepherd Boy On The Backs side of the desert who's better than you and see we can come to church and we can be religious but you know what it's sometimes it's just little kids that can be more faithful than us that's right see the thing is is who who's going to be faithful who's going to be obedient to the word come on see because even in Jesus when he when he said in the last days he said they'll come to me and say Lord Lord did we not cast out Devils did we not preach in your name did we not prophesy did we not do all these things and he says depart from me he said I never knew you right he said because you can do a lot of things but he said if you're not obedient to the whole word he said it doesn't mean anything and that's why we have to be obedient amen amen bless he speaks this he's speaking of the sins that they committed he said he said my people have committed two sins y he said they have forsaken me he said the Fountain of Living Water bless this is from broken sisters here y'all just y'all just pray for me bless I'm going I'm gonna get through this he said now a Fountain of Living Water we find out he said what is a Fountain of Living Water he said we find out what a sistern is now what is a Fountain of Living Water it's an artisian whale an artisian whale what's said brother Brandon it's a well that it's always come it always comes from beneath and pushes the water out it's flowing all the time it is self-supporting always fresh and clean an artisian whale a Fountain of Living Water it's not dead and stagnant it stagnated it's living it's constantly changing bringing up something new all the time moving on coming from its resources it draws from its resources from from its bed which is a still a Fountain of Living Water spraying up self cleansing it's clean Pure Clean Water it's self-supporting you don't have to wait for the rains to fill its tank up it's always a bubbling up gives its water free you don't have to pump it wind it twist it or or join it it's just a Fountain of Living Waters amen and here it was he said they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Water can you imagine here he is he's speaking of a fountain that's that's always moving that's always flowing that's always clean and pure you can see this just overflowing just as brother R was speaking of that rock that was in the wilderness here was that rock and he said you know the the artist draw the picture and he said it was like a little cupful that come out of the out of the Rock and he said but that little stream would have never never you know thirst you know quench The Thirst of all of those camels and all of those people he said because it was a gusher he said it was a yes a fountain that was pouring out of that rock and here he is he's speaking I am I'm that Fountain amen not just a little stream not a trickle but a gusher brother ra calls it a Geer you just coming forth pouring out right here it is fresh and clean and pure and so it's not just a little stream but here it comes to pouring out FR in front of the people and he said he said they have forsaken me and he said he said here it is just an overwhelming pouring out of of of who I am before him but he said he said but they have forsaken me and he said they've he them out sisters right broken sisters he said that can hold no water and so you you look here and you know what what is a sister well before we get into that you know you go back to John John 7 and Jesus speaking you know he said he said whoever is a thirst come unto me you know he said I'll let them drink of the Water of Life freely and he said and he said when you drink from me he said out of your bellies shall flow rivers of Living Water see they had the opportunity see that's what that's what they were passing up see it was not it was them drinking in the living water and it coming out of them that they become that that Fountain right and he said they've he them out sisters what is a sister brother says it's a it's a man weigh whale brother yes sir milon cab they have a big big pile of water com that's right that's right they had a big pile of water coming out I mean I mean can you you imagine what is that 6 eight cups gallons whatever a day try try to imagine that for 2 and a half million people and a little stream look like your water fountain coming out going to feed that many people brother R says he said a sister it's a it's a it's a thing dug in the ground to take the place of a whale right he said when people don't have a whale they get a sister in other words a sistern is a man-made tank or a manmade whale in the ground that man dig out to catch the water to use it right they said they use it for wash water and drinking water and everything he said you used to have an old thing you had to wind around and around and around to get the water up had little buckets on it to pump the water out and we notice one thing about a sistern that's different from a whale he said a sister will get empty the sister cannot fill itself right he said it's not reliable you can't rely on a sister right it has to rely and depend upon the rains that fall in the summer and the winter whatever it was usually in the winter time when the snow and the rain comes then it runs the water off into the sister and brother Rand goes on to talk about that when the in the country and they would build they would build a sistern he said they would attach it to the barn and he said all of this stuff and you know and it so it sounds so appealing and I don't know some of you some of you know you know some of you know know what a sister is cuz we've seen it and it's you know it's the most appetizing thing you've seen but said you know he said they attach it to the barn and he said all of the animals walking around and all the things that they do he said all that stuff builds up on top of the barn and he said when the rains come he said it washes all of that off and it goes right into a sistern and he said all of that junk is right in that sister and then he said when when they're sitting in that sister then he said you know he said talk about the bugs and the wiggle tails and all that other stuff that builds up in that and there it sits and you know it just kind of you know you know it's a dirty smelly mess and I you know you know ruin your breakfast this morning but you know you look at you look at all that and that that that is what they went for a sister and he said you know they try to use a rag and they try to cover up the end of it to keep it from coming out and brother R said he said you might keep the bugs in the sister he said but you don't keep the juice out I what the prophet said but that's what happens see but you see the what what what they have went for and that's what they were doing y you see this nasty smelly thing in the ground that was unreliable he said he said they hidden them out and he said they were broken he said that can hold no water right and brother bom said he said oh yeah they might get filled when they had a Revival but they couldn't hold anything right he said it would go in and it would go right back out and so they would fill up but it don't take long till it's gone and so then from the from the previous time you've got all of the stuff that's still in there and then you add more water to it then you've got the filth from the last time then you've got more filth and then you got more filth how are you going to ever get you can't ever get the dirt out of it it's still just going to stay filthy the whole time and it just continually gets worse and worse and worse but he said that's what they've done they've heed them out a sistern a mess a water a filth and turn down this Pure Clean artisian whale and went for a a fil right or in other words you can call it a Cess pool and he said that's what they've done right he said they they forsaken me and went to a Cess pool when when he tried to bring them to a place to show and all the way through this this is the one thing that it's the it's the one thought that that I can't that I never get out of my mind the whole time when I'm when I was reading the book of mind and studying you keep going back to that sister that's where they were at that's what they long for was the filth and you know the thing is is we we get in the same we can get in the same condition you know brother Brown talked about what was what was the sister he said it was a denomination right amen he said what was it he said it was a denomination right and you know what it's becomes a denominational idea M amen and what happens see see there there's there's nothing wrong but the problem is is people have put put their period and behind what they believe and that's it they can't go on any further with God because when they got to that place then that ended it just like brother vam said he said you know God moved upon the people and he said they had a Revival but he said then they decided to stop and he said they wouldn't go any further he said he said they wouldn't he said they re rejected a further impregnation of the word and he said when that happened he said go back and look and show me he said a denomination that ever had a Revival that God ever went back to and revived and done anything with right amen and we get in we can get in the same condition right amen Jeremiah chapter 3 Jeremiah speaking he says they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man's shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou Hast played the Harlot with many lovers yet return again to me sayeth the Lord lift up mine eyes un the high places and see where thou Hast not been lean with in the days that thou Hast sat for them as the Raven in the wilderness and thou has polluted the land with homs and with wickedness therefore the showers have been withholding and there hath been no light or rain for thou Hast a horse forehead thou shouldest thou should us be ashamed right and it goes on in verse 7 it says and I said after she had done all these things turn turn thou unto me but she return returned not and her treacherous sister Judah saw it and I saw when when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not but went and played the Harlot also so when he's speaking to the people of of Israel see he's calling out and was talking of the poll of the pollution see when a man put away his wife because she played the Harlot he wasn't supposed to take her back he wasn't supposed to have anything else to do with her but you know here he is he's calling to Israel but see they would not come back but you know see it wasn't for a it wasn't for a lack of God calling them because here he is but he says he said you have a for a horse forehead he said the the water has been withholding right so you go back to to the sister a sister that can hold no water that's dry because if it can hold no water because the water is gone then the water is withholding so there is no water so here you are you're in a place of complete dry you're in a drought but see he has been but he was calling to him and see how and it got even worse because when he said when Israel was doing these things he said Judah saw it right and could not see the detriment under Israel right but Judah went ahead and done the same thing right he said he is he's calling unto unto Judah to to come back just same as as he did for Israel but she would not come but she didn't come back either because you know what it becomes such a a such a thing that's so great that that when other people are doing it you know what people get roped into it also because people try to keep up with the Joneses because you know what it becomes a spirit and because many times we've seen and you go around and look at churches and the first thing that happens if if a if a minister if a pastor compromises on the word on anything and you let something come into the church and it's not called out and it's not removed then you wait and see it opens the door right and all of a sudden you see all kind of Filth come into the church because when you compromise on the word behind the pull pit when the word is compromised on then you open the door for everything to come in right and it just becomes and it may start out it starts out small but you can see how things have opened up and the next thing you know you have the things that are going on in the m message today that's right that's right because see as soon as soon as you compromise and see what you have to be careful about that because see the thing is is people have built a sistern they have built their own sistern but you know what it can't hold in water and what happens is you see all of a sudden the next thing you know we have all of these doctrines right and that's what has happened is people have have left the word right amen they' not they not quit being religious right but they've they've left the word right and that's what is happened we have we you know there's no there's no lack of religion in the world there's a lack of Truth in the world Amen it's it's the truth that'll set you free right not being religious Religion Don't Do Anything see that's was who was it Jesse Ventura the the wrestler whatever then he was governor of Minnesota right you know he's talking about feeble-minded people you know feeble-minded people are or you know what was it feebleminded people lean on religion or something other like that was his was his quote Oh My see you know the thing is if it wasn't if it wasn't for and and you know that's right oh my you know I thought about it at first I was a little upset you know what that's right right just just just as the uh the poem that brother R quotes about long fell you know he said don't be like dumb driven cattle but you know what people people are just like that right so you know the thing is are you like are you like a d you know are you like dumb driven cattle right because you know the thing is is they just heard you in One Direction you don't have any idea where you're going there's nobody out in front of you you know someone said one time he said are you like dumb driven cattle or he said are you like sheep sheep are lad you know the shepherd's not behind the Sheep right The Shepherd's in front of the sheep that's right the she because the sheep have their eye on the shepherd CLE ain't that way they just kind of push them this way and they go this way and that way and you got to go get them out of the weeds and and you know the gullies and everywhere else why because they go every direction you're just trying to push them in One Direction but you know brother I'm talking about that sheep that sheep having his eye on the shepherd He said wherever that Shepherd went he said that sheep went he said you know when they went through that one that market when he was overseas and he said you know he said you look at them he said you know they thought it you know brother thought it was going to be pandon him there thought going to be all kind of Destruction he said they might have looked at that fruit and those vegetables and those things he said but they didn't touch it he said because they had their eye on the shepherd He said they went the same way the shepherd went they walked in his footsteps and so that's the way we have to be can you know if if that's the way you know if if you want to be like him then you've got to walk like him because are we are we going to walk the way that he walked right I don't think I ever gave you the title of this sermon but my the title this after I got this so this far is is entitled Disobedience leads to a broken sister right right that's what led to their the broken sister right that's right was their Disobedience and that's that was all the way through the scripture that's all God was looking for was their obedience right he he was referring to them to come back amen you know he was faithful and he kept referring back to the promises and this is from broken sister in 1964 5 he said and Israel found the same thing as examples in their Journey to the promised land he said the tanks were all dry yeah journey in obedience to his Promised Land the journey and the tanks they found dry now they found the tanks could not be depended on for the journey and he said if you're going to journey in obedience to the word of God and try to join this and that you're going to find out there ain't a tank in the world that will support it not at all you are an individual and God leads you just this the way he wants to lead you then we have found the same thing today all the tanks are dried up and God wants us see it's a journey and it's a journey and I I love that journey in obedience it was that was their that was their journey and it was in Journey in obedience right that's that was the whole thing right to find out if they were going to if they would be obedient or not right and so here they go all the way through and here and you know he keeps referring back to the fathers right referring and here they are going back and looking and showing them hey your fathers y I done this for them y I done that for them amen and he said you know they were the ones that walked away from me he said they failed me right but you know what God when they failed God he still went on with them said to keep going to keep going he suffered with them was longsuffering see an amazing thing what you know because you know how how we are we can be short with people and we can we get sometimes we want to write people off but you know what here is he he wanted to keep going with them and still had that promise until they turned him down for the kadish barell when it was time to go in they didn't want to go amen see God will will you know he will go with you for so long but there comes a time that you've got to walk with him right that you've got that you've got to go further than than we've went right and you you go back and and look there's there's many things that that you look at Jeremiah and there some things I wanted to get into but just touch on them you know you you you look at you look at Jeremiah and here's Jeremiah going out daily and standing before the people and and speaking to them and trying to bring them back and in uh chapter I believe it's chapter 20 there verse 8 he says for since I spake I cried not I cried out I cried violence and spool because the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily it was a reproach unto him because see he was the only one standing out there front of all these people trying to prove what was truth and he said it was a derision it was because the word the word was contempt before the people there was contempt for it there was contempt for him and and brother and Jeremiah goes on to say and then I said I will not make mention of him nor speak anymore in his name but it was but his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and I was weary with forbearing and could not stay right what an amazing thing that that Jeremiah got tired of it it was it was weary to him it wore him down but you know what he stood there and he said yeah but it was like he said when I could not when I would not mention him when I would not do this he said it was like fire shut up in my bones amen sometimes I wonder if we have that sometimes I say Lord where is that in me come on that that we would have that we would have that desire sometimes sometimes one because we get we get weak and you know we we're scared sometimes because we don't you know and the other thing is like people ask me say why why don't you say why don't you say something about this or something about that like the best thing for me to do is wait on the Lord if the Lord don't give me anything to say to people then I don't say anything but the problem is that sometimes we know the Lord has spoke to us to tell somebody something or say something to people but you know what we don't say it right but you know the thing is here here here you you can imagine the all of the all the things that Jeremiah Was facing but here is in the chapter one and and God speaking to Jeremiah says Thou therefore bur up thy loins and arise and speak unto them that I that I command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest I confound thee thee before them now listen to this this is Chap 1:8 says for behold I have made thee this day a defensed city and an iron pillar and Brazen walls against the whole land against the kings of Judah against the princes thereof against the priest thereof and against the people of the land see when all of that was going on and all that Jeremiah had to face but God made him a promise Jeremiah told God told Jeremiah said listen he said you're like a defense City see when all the things had come against him the Kings the the princes all the religious realm everybody was against him and yet God told him said you're defensed you're protected see here he was he said you just go out there and speak because he he he was God longed to bring them back into fellowship and he said look he said you're protected see sometimes we forget who we serve that that we are that we are protected that that we are covered see we we have that protection see because you know he said he said if if one Falls at your right side you know at your left hand he said but no it won't come n thee he said the angels of God are encamped about those that fear Him see if you're encamped about then see the thing is is you're defensed you have a defense see the thing is that I'm so thankful that I have one that even when I don't know what's going on he does that that he covers me because I can you know there's things that happen in my life that if I didn't have him I you know you don't know what can happen because you can't move you can't get out of the way but you know what he can take care of you and then we then you know Jeremiah he keeps coming back and he keeps bringing these things and you know God keeps speaking to Jeremiah and he's bringing these these things out and he keeps bringing them back and he's telling the people and one of the other things that he talks about is he takes him to The Potter's House and when he goes down to The Potter's House you know he sees he sees the Potter with the with the clay and he has the power over to make it anyway and when it doesn't turn out right he start it over he didn't throw the He Didn't Throw the Clay Away he just took them all and broke it and crushed it and was able to start again and mold it again right he said see do I not have power over the mo over the clay to mold it into in any way that I want it to be and so here it is he was molding that clay into into his fashion that that he wanted it to be and say see the way it is with you and I we can we can be molded into that into His Image see the thing is is do do we allow God to do that to us that that he can mold us right into His Image but it takes him you can't do it yourself you have to ow him to do it and and then we know that Jeremiah also Jeremiah also was given the prophecy of the 70 years in in Babylon you know the thing is is Isaiah Isaiah spoke to the children of Israel because it was the king of Assyria that was coming to take them over and they should have went into bondage then but you know the people repented and came back in line and they didn't fall but you know the thing is is there came a time that Jeremiah was up and he prophesied before the people and he come to the point where he starts speaking in past tense because he had spoke to the people and realized that they were going to go into bondage anyway they were not going they were not going to repent so in the prophecies he speaks in he speaks in the past tense because he realized this is what's going to take place they were going into the bondage right but but see the other thing is he says in the end he knows there's a restoration coming sure amen he said they've went into bondage and he's speaking in past tense and they not even went into bondage yet but he stands up and he gives the word that there's a restoration there amen and so see that's what we have today we have a word of restoration am we have been giving the word of restoration brother BR brother BR tells us anything anything outside the word of outside of Jesus Christ in the word of life he said it's a broken sister right he said whatever that you have and he said even the things that we do in this life even our hopes and things that that we put our put our time and our abilities in he said they broken sisters he said because the thing is he said that you put your time and effort into things and he said you'll never get anything out of it he said it just it sucks the life right out of you sucks your time and everything right out of you and there's no profit to it see it's just as Jeremiah was speaking here he said what is the prophit does it pro what do you get anything back out of it that you put into it is it just sucking it right out of you do you are you reaping anything from it right and many times people have that's what has tied up their whole life in things and there's no benefit to it right men right they've not they've not reaped anything amen but see that's what we have today we have see you can't ever outg give God there's nothing that you can't do do with you know because this is the greatest thing because you know the scripture tells us he said it's it's a 30-fold a 60-fold a 100 fold see you can't you can't get that kind of deance for me anybody right there no there's no financial institution in the world give you that kind of deal but here it is you know brother R said he said you seow one little seed and he said you'll reap a wash tub full right what an amazing thing now I know I know brother talking about you know we we SE things things of the Flesh and he said it comes back to you know we reap a whole Wash Tub full but I believe it's the same way in in in the in the things that are right and real because God because he said you know you know try me and see if I don't open up the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that you cannot contain but see the thing is is you've got a try amen but see the thing is is God calls us and you know it's it's so amazing God wants us just to be obedient if we can be obedient and we see people people have gotten away from things just as just as brother R speaking of of Eve Eve didn't wait right he got ahead of God right he said Sarah got ahead of God right there was a plan and a purpose but but they but they were ahead of of the plan right and they and they brought death right and destruction and heartache right and we do the same thing amen right because see the thing is is it takes the it takes the word to have life and to have it more abundant it takes the word but the thing is is you've got to wait on God because people people have gotten a thought from God and you know that but if you don't hold it before God God and it's got to become a revelation right and see that's what that's what happened to a lot of people because see people hear a lot of things and they see a lot of things but you know what it's got to become a revelation right if people because see you just like brother R was talking about you know I I don't believe I don't believe people start out to be bad right right he said even talking about the Catholics he when they go to you know and the in the nuns going to the monasteries and and everything the convents and everything like that he said they don't do that to be bad he said they do that because they're they're TR they have a desire right but the problem is is is when you when you see people today they've not held on because if you're not going to hold on before God and let him lead you it's got to be you've got to be led by him right not if we try to do anything ourselves it's a miserable failure but see that's what's happened to a lot of people and that's the reason that things have happened the way that they are today is people have not held on and stood and just waited on God right and if we can just wait on God he can mold us and make us into His Image into what he wants us to be right and that's what that's that's what I have this morning for you because that that's that's what's on my heart amen we need to be obedient amen God God help us to be obedient to the word many times we you know are you drinking from a sister this morning bless are you drinking from an artisian whale come on do you have an illusion oh my of an artisian whale is it is it just an idea or is it really a whale right is it really A whale that's

Fountain come on amen amen God bless you let's all stand amen because that's what I want every single day I want that artisian well sprinking up I want to I want the River of Life you know we sing
