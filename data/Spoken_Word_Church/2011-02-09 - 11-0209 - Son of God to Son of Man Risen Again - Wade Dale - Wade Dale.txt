TRANSCRIPT
========================================
shiny then when we first begun let's praise god praise god praise god open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to open see eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love and we sing holy holy holy high and lift it down shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy amen turn around shake somebody's hand and you have just seen god good to have you out here tonight all this global warming that's going on around here we'll uh have to revisit that i think i think the almanac said we were supposed to have a warm winter i think they got the mcdonald's almanac from down in jamaica when they figured that one out because they're calling for up to an inch or more snow here tonight so we're gonna try to get finished a little early and i did not promise eight o'clock i don't know where he when he gets older he starts hearing voices or something i don't know but if you have your bible turn to the book of matthew 17 we will uh kind of continue a thought from what we were what we're doing in sunday school class but uh i just realized uh yesterday that uh we're being watched so brother joseph just gave us a uh update on who's watching the uh videos that's going out of here downstairs too so brother donny and brother joe just you're being watched joyce you're being watched we were watching her last night and brother dick was doing something she was sitting away she took her arm and run it down so i think 175 people saw that so watch what you're doing we're being watched but no in all honesty uh we've had over 28 000 hits just on the video and we went through and looked at some last night and i had not really looked on it before brother joe sent me an email yesterday morning and said we're being watched so we thank god for that um we don't try to uh we're not a ministry to the world but i do believe we got a ministry that maybe is a little different than most that uh and we'll try tonight maybe to uh to show some of that and in what we're speaking on it'll be on the same line of the son of god and son of man but we're going to speak tonight on risen again because he said here in matthew of what he what he's saying here risen again from the dead because i believe that that we're in the end time we're in the son of man revelation but that does not mean that you got it there was millions of people in jesus day the day that the son of man one man the son of man walked on the earth in human flesh and brother brown said they didn't 100 people know who he was that's the same thing that's going on now and that was to the most religious people in the world that he came to but matthew 17 verse nine and let's bow our heads truly remember uh brother claude he called last night brother jess is not doing well his blood pressure went from to 60 over 40 and that's not good and his mother's in the hospital when you moan you heard that but just uh um bless his heart he called me last night and he said i just wanted to hear a pleasant voice he said it's hard out here they're getting eight inches of snow today so that's not gonna help either so you get uh cabin fever like they always say when you get shut in like that and they've been they've been shut in so let's just keep them in our prayers and in our hearts dear heavenly father we pray tonight that you will come among us lord just one more time that you would speak the words father as we truly were talking to brother ray we we want to come up here a dead man whether you can live lord through this person and speak to the people father that we would all die out to ourself and our feelings and our ideas and our doctrines and our little petty feelings that we have just human life but that will lay all that aside lord and not worry about trying to get home lord or not worrying about the day tomorrow because even you said in your word that the day tomorrow would take care of itself father we pray that you just be with the ones out in oklahoma father just bless them dear brother jess lord lift him up be with brother claude's mother and be with the whole family lord there just one big family extended family of our of our own father we pray that you'd bless them and be with them touch them be with a little bride around the world be with the missionaries lord in the foreign fields bless each one father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes give us today our daily bread lord forgive us of our trespasses bless each one of us father as we go into the open the word lord may you quicken it to our hearts father in jesus name we pray amen matthew 17 verse nine you've got the uh the jest of what's going on here it's the after six days jesus took peter and james and john on the mountain and he was transfigured and there was moses and elijah was there with him and then as they come down off the mountain in verse nine it says as they came down from the mountain jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples ask him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come see they even know now brother gary that elijah's supposed to show up before this coming of this of this man this prophet man this um this prophet's got elijah's got to come before jesus come all right and his disciples said why should the scribes say life must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elijah truly shall first come and restore all things now we know for a fact who that was that was the prophet in the end time the um forthcoming of elijah through the prophet william branham and restore all things because john the baptist did not restore all things john the baptist came to introduce the one that was going to restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already now see he switched right around and told him that john the baptist was there identifying who that man was and they knew him not but have done unto him whatever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them you may be seated in the lord as blessing to them the reading of the word i like what brother joe forney says thank the lord for the reading of the word we can go home now and be just fine but we're not now as we see this come in this part of matthew josh wanna how about get me some water i didn't do my deacon duties and get my own water usually i do thank you but we see the order of his coming and listen to what the prophet said on the patmos vision 1960 1204 now notice before jesus returns to the earth now this is a little ahead of time but the spirit of elijah will return back to the earth and turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers the bible said so jesus saw him there the apostles saw him there the order of the coming of the son of man glorified he is to be glorified and coming back amen the first thing before they saw him was what elijah then what moses which was a type of israel returning yonder the law keepers and then the glorified son of man amen hallelujah do you see the order of his coming the spirit of elijah or the witness of the last church age coming in power to manifest him so there he's identifying that that son of man has got to come back in the end time not the spirit of john the baptist elijah that was to introduce the son of man to bring him to a death the first time and then he's to raise again or if you are dead and you raise one time and here he says that he rose again from the dead amen all right now we know for a fact this is not a physical killing but it's actually worse right it's worse because it's a spiritual killing you can be alive and be dead the bible says the if the light in you be darkness how great is that darkness in other words you think it's light but it's nothing but darkness right all around thank you so we see that now we see elijah coming to the gentiles moses to the 144 000. we know elijah and moses are both going but elijah's got to first come here and he did through the prophet to bring us a message to the gentiles to turn us back to take us out of here and then come back to the jews all right now where is he going to rise again the first time he rose from the dead he rose physically out of a grave amen all right we're going to go through and do it one two three four five down the line and show how this son of man was killed again or was put down by the people but he rose again not physically but he rose again where in the hearts of the people not one person exactly all right he rose again as the son of man as one person but when he come back on the day of pentecost he left that flesh and came on the people in the baptism of the holy ghost the son of god dispensation or the spirit god but we'll get to that in just a second but watch god tonight right up to this hour that we're we're living today today tonight amen all right because if not then we've left the god somewhere else and he's a dead god if we leave him somewhere right so he's not a dead god he's an alive god he's an alive god because you brought him here tonight because you're still alive right all right so now let's go back and look because there's a dispensation of the son of god that had to come first because god was first elohim our spirit all right was spirit elohim self-existing right right spirit god amen not a spook like a like a uh you know casper the friendly ghost when we think of spirit uh i said to of course i work with several hundred hispanics and they're all several hundred of them catholics when they want to be and just for your information if you have an iphone if you're a catholic you can now go on your iphone and get an application that lets you um do your confessions over your telephone that's the truth and josh we pulled it up on in our iphone and you can app mom and him were there dad was there you can actually go on your iphone and if you've committed a sin or an adultery or killed somebody you can immediately get on your phone and contact the priest and let him of course you got to send him a little money but he will say a prayer for you and intercede so and it's foolishness you know it's just the foolishness of man but there's a real god amen right they may worship that one but there's a real one right there's one that's alive never died right never will die but that self-existing elohim came in the form of the son of god the first form that he comes into us this is elementary but it we got to go somewhere with it logos or theophany the spirit god he was not in human flesh at that time all right but he did start on his way to human flesh amen because he created the earth to get it from because had there not been a fall guess what would have happened that son of god would have been god in human flesh right all right you say you how do you know that well that's what it's going to end up right and we got to go back to that we can't get out of the book of genesis and make it something different when we get over to the book of revelation all right so that son of god that logos theophany spirit god it wasn't that he didn't have a form he was a human man because in genesis 1 26 he said let us make man in our image and in our likeness that was the first time god was declaring how he was going to make more sons amen right and daughters that's right let us make man and let them have dominion over the sea the fish and the fowl the air and all the things that's why i love that that scripture it just it comes so alive to know that that god had made a place for us amen and that you know jesus even came and said now i go to prepare a place for you well he prepared it before the foundation of the world he didn't wait till he got there on earth and then started preparing a place for the people right now he started when he started saying let there be he was preparing a place for you and i to live all right he did not wait till he came the first time to to create anything and now he when he said let there be let there be let it be it was all brother mark for you and i right it was not for him he's not a selfish god that's right all right so in genesis 1 26 he's he's declaring how he's going to make more sons he said multiply and replenish the earth and we were not in any sexual form to do that it was a spirit man a man that was not created and set aside no it was god just expanding himself showing that he was because he was still let on him remember we've read in scripture many times and this may be a little more for them for maybe the people that are there watching but but god in in genesis 1 there 30 times the word god is used and that's the elohim self existing even after genesis 1 26 where he said let us you think that's plurality or and in god it's not because god when when he looks at his bride he looks he sees one man when you look at your wife do you see four or five no you see one if you got a problem with that then you got a problem with that if you look and see four or five but that's what god wanted to do and that's what he begun to do because then he took a piece of that genesis 1 26 and put it in a man called adam and there was god in human flesh amen that's how he got started god in human flesh right in adam adam even had so much control over the things till he was the god of the earth and as we say all right well then adam lost it but i'm going to read you a quote in a few minutes if i can get to it where brother brown said the son of man is the heir of the earth see the son of man will never be singular anymore right right he will not and i'll read it to you in just a minute he will not be saying there was one son of man walked on the face of the earth that was god almighty pure and human flesh glory all right but now he didn't come just to make that was his way to not go around but that was his way to get through that genesis to back to that genesis 1 condition genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity between thy seed what he had to come in human right flesh human seed form to take the sin away so that we can go back right all right so adam was the first one in flesh right we'll hurry through this that's number three and i only got about number 16. but in the fall god had to hide itself amen right but he couldn't hide itself in human flesh anymore right he had to withdraw from that because that human being had caused a condition to happen to where god couldn't get inside that man again not saying he never will because that's his purpose was to have man in his own image and in his likeness and to have rulership over something all right but god had to then in the old testament he had to hide in the form of clouds right and fire and burning bushes amen that's right everybody understand see amen amen all right holy of holies badger skin could only contain god for a time god wanted to get back in man when he screamed brother dean in genesis 3 15 when he screamed that out that was the way he was going to do it and that's the way he made for us to come back so there's nothing we do it's what he does genesis 3 15 i'm going to bring you back right i'm going to go through the old testament though and i'm going to rest on a group of people but i can't dwell in that group of people right right he would anoint moses he would anoint even ezekiel i was reading in ezekiel where i think in ezekiel about 60 something times god says son of man prophesy right all through the old testament but it's son of man prophesy amen son of man prophesy all right what was he doing he was coming down for a moment in human flesh speaking what he was going to do right what he was going to do amen all right so the son of god rested on a group of people the prophet said with faith abraham had faith and god honored that faith right moses had faith and god honored moses faith but yet they were not what god wanted to rest in because he couldn't get to him because of the badger skin because of the veil that was put there by me and you unbelief but in ezekiel 1 read that for yourself to save time but in ezekiel 1 he says son of man prophesy right actually we got a few more let's go to ezekiel 1. because you watch this group of people jeremiah ezekiel and watch what's going to happen i told the brother the other night when brother uh smith was here talking about the interval you know there was church ages in the old testament remember we proved that we we drew it up on the board and showed how moses could be would be the pattern messenger and and how that the last messenger to the seventh age would be john the baptist to introduce who jesus christ just like it is in the end time but remember there was an interval between the old testament and the new testament from malachi to john there was 400 years there was no prophet there was no priest there was no they just lived their life day to day did the sacrifice and then all of a sudden here you see john the baptist come on the scene god was doing something though during that time god is never idle all right ezekiel 1 look at verse to me here we go again back to parallel revelations and uh you know and what what brother dale's been bringing out it has been become more real because i look in ezekiel and i read chapter one looks just like revelations four yeah now it came to pass thirteenth year fourth month by the river chi bar that the heavens were open and i saw a vision of god where was the open door revelations four right all right and then ezekiel goes up through that door into heaven caught up and watched what he saw look at verse four and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire and a brightness and out of the mix with the color of amber what was that that's revelations 1 where john is describing jesus christ glory and also look at verse 5 and also out of the midst thereof now where did he see the son of man in revelations 1 in the midst of the golden candlesticks also of the myths thereof came the likeness of four living creatures now who are those four living creatures given to the bride of jesus christ all right because the prophet saw there in revelation where the uh in this fourth seal in the fifth seal he said you don't see the the the uh living creatures anymore he says therefore the rapture took place in the fourth seal because those four combat beasts are given to me and you to combat the devil four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man revelations one john turns and sees in the midst of the golden candlesticks which is what the church ages right the living creatures he sees a man standing in the midst in the midst just like he saw there in revelation chapter one and if you'll read all the way through there you'll see the absolute same thing revelations four and five you see one over there in verse 26 you'll see one sitting on the throne and upon the likeness of the throne with the likeness as the appearance of a man had to be a man now look at chapter two he starts off right here and i say unto you son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee if you'll go through there you're going to see that ezekiel remember in the old testament they used scrolls right but now john was told in revelations 10 to take a book man we have books in the end time right they had scrolls back then all right ezekiel 2 verse 9 when i looked and behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without didn't revelation 5 say there was a book sealed on the what inside and the outside exactly and there was written there in lamentations and mornings and woes what was that there's your seven seals moreover he said unto me verse three or chapter three verse one more ever said unto me look at that capital s that's not the beginning of a sentence right so that's not just talking to ezekiel that's talking to the son of man all right eat that vow find us what do you tell john to do in revelation 10 about 8-9 he said eat that book eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll and he said unto me son of man caused thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth what as honey for sweetness right and he said unto me son of man go get thee into the house of israel and speak with my words unto them for thou art not sent to a people of strange speech out of an hard language but to the bride of jesus christ if you want to say that that's not changing the word of god i believe we're the house of israel spiritually don't you but you see how parallels when i was looking at the son of man i went back to ezekiel like i said about 60 something times god is speaking through ezekiel then you see that son of man becoming so real that you can't separate them but then you have to separate them because they were not the son of man they were not the son of man the son of man is the lord jesus christ all right so let's not get that mixed up ezekiel was not a born again believer he was not a he was not a a son of god by a birth because they couldn't be birthed in the old testament because jesus hadn't died to release the life to birth them with all right that's just so simple but a lot of people in the message have a real hard time believing that right and i don't see why and it's not degrading i believe abraham's the son of god i believe ezekiel's the son of god but not by birth not in the original creation you and i are we're born again we're in the original creation amen right all right these others are allowed or are given eternal life by the faith that they had right right that's it because brother branham was saying he said look at all them great people of faith right not even born again shouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves that moses could call fleas clouds and frogs under the blood of bulls and goats and we can't even have faith for a headache amen you love the lord amen well i do too more than ever but these people in the old testament were not just floundering floundering around not doing anything they were actually putting a a platform or a place for the son of man to rest on right because what did they do they built that body for the son of man to rest in for the son of god to rest in to make him the son of man which is god in human flesh but that was they were put there to introduce one man right all those prophets in the old testament were there to introduce one man now he said boy you really narrowed it down now in that man is all this bible in that one man was all this eternal life right in that bible where you and i sitting here tonight if you're born again come on so let's just don't say well it was all in one man and that was it no it was all that one man but he didn't want to stay that way right he did not want to stay that's that one inside of him was wanting to release the life that's what he came to do right right right that's what he came to do i come to do my own will that's not what he said i came to do the will of the father the son of god the spirit inside of him that said let there be light amen thou art the christ the son of the living god we know you're the creator god somewhere inside of that man right exactly because no man can do these things except like nicodemus said say it except he come from god right amen okay but now nicodemus didn't go a step further and take that god and put it in his heart right that was the problem he had is that the problem we have because i hear people talk of the son of man sure this is the son of man dispensation brother branham brought the son of man this is the son of man ministry i'll promise you one thing i'm telling them downstairs in the sunny school class i'm getting a little ahead of myself but that's okay if you're born again tonight you have a revelation of the son of god right because if you're born again you have to have a revelation to get born again so you have a revelation of the son of god amen the son of god is the new birth is the spirit god the logos the theophany that came to you and changed your life right amen but that's not the son of man revelation but just cause you live in this age i'll read it in just a few minutes but not sure this generation will receive it but it's because of luke 17. in this day is the reason we're getting it right all right so just keep that in your hat for a minute and then and chew on it a while we'll get to it in just a moment maybe about 8 30 we'll be done now when they introduced god in human flesh the prophets built the body a body that has prepared me in hebrews 10 i believe it was believe it is there was a body made by creation and that son of god stepped into that body called the son of man which was god in human flesh one man there was nobody else on the face of the earth when jesus was on earth that had that capacity or that office right all right he was the only one now listen to what brother branham said it's kind of i just found this quote just a few minutes ago listen to what we we always think of the son of man and just say well that was jesus the you know the the sacrifice the one to give his life you know but listen to this because i believe one thing and and i beat this scripture to death but when jesus said all power in heaven earth has been given unto me that was the son of man right that was god in human flesh but now listen in revelation chapter 1 1960-1204 he was son of man prophet amen he was son of man sacrifice priest he son of man as king amen the son of david sitting on the throne of his majesty son of man god manifested as son of man he came down and became man to take sin away from the world he became man as a prophet he became man as a priest he became man as a king king of heaven amen king of saints the eternal king always was king always will be king eternal king he said that was the son of man amen we always think well that's just son of man and just jesus christ right there in human flesh all that all the attributes that are in jesus christ is just what i said now there's offices that he that he proved when he was on earth priest king prophet sacrifice but it was still god in human flesh and it's not any different now it's just any mini member body right so now this baby that was born that grew up inside of that child was the son of god amen right believe it or not most people in the message don't but he was born lord the christ the son of god but he was the son of man that's right we're the son of god inside of it not two different people one person all right and i think that's the mystery that we and i want to say this in a in a light form sometimes we think that we're born again so there's another person don't get me wrong it was it was god but when god comes in brother branham made a statement one time he said this is my eye he said god gave it to me and now it's mine right god gave me the holy ghost and now whose is it it's mine right we ain't in there fighting together right it should be one man not two if you got two in there it's the devil excuse me so this person that walked on the earth and i'm saying this in a form i want you to see this son of man was motivated by the son of god amen right exactly he was motivated by the son of god he said i do nothing now that didn't mean that he didn't live in human life and do the things of human life god didn't have to tell him when to eat and god didn't have to tell him that's not true i believe that he was all the time god but he was all the time human amen all right uh some people say well he spoke this and he spoke that well that's okay you know if he was speaking to the disciples and said you know i'm hungry go get me something deep maybe that wasn't prophecy that we needed but it was still god talking it was still god speaking it was still god motivating it was not someone else motivating someone else if you do then you got two people brother gary and you've got two persons all right so no you've only got one person now but now this man was not completely here we go he was not complete until he come to the river jordan to receive something exactly not another son of god not another holy ghost but what was in him was anointed for a job amen it was just a girl that something came from somewhere else and and this other person now resides no he was gone all the time he was son of man son of god you read the prophet what he said here he was king priest prophet the whole thing and then something came upon this man amen that come from god father spirit amen that had not been given to him before exactly it was a message a way to get me and you out of him amen that's the whole thing that is the whole nutshell that is the whole message in a nutshell god brought this flesh alive onto the face of the earth with us bottled up inside of him and there was no way for us to get out unless he did it in a spiritual form not a natural form so it had to be the spiritual word of god come out of that man's mouth amen that we now read called the word of god matthew mark luke and john every how you want to say it that three and a half year message but out of that three and a half year message you and i were quickened out of our dead works into a living word the son of god came down and quickened that word in your heart and made you a son of god right right now but he was anointed at jordan for a message we hear the son of man speaking i do nothing unless i see the unless i see it first and the father shows me right that's what he was saying but what about the same man that walked up one day and said destroy this temple right and i know my father will raise it up in three days that's not what he said he said you put it in the ground and i'll bring it back up i'm gonna tell you something whatever happens in that resurrection believe has got to be tied to what's going to happen in this resurrection because it can't be any different it's the same man standing doing the same thing right just in a many members body not in one person that's just how much i believe that god was in that flesh doing the work and you couldn't separate that man in that flesh i mean that god in that flesh and brother branham would give the illustration he'd say you know the lady said well jesus wept he said sure he said when he walked by that tree and he needed something to eat and he looked at that tree and it wasn't bringing forth fruit he just cursed it he said was that a man or was that god right he said surely he was man when he went to the grave of lazarus he cried he said when he throw them little shoulders back and called a man that had been dead for four days called his spirit back from wherever it was and put it back in that flesh and didn't just put it in that flesh and keep it rotten it took that flesh and restored it back to when it had died he said that's more than a man but now guess what that man didn't go anywhere that man is still here all right so now this man they put him on a cross and they killed him they killed the son of man because he said the son of man is going to have to go and give his life amen okay the son of man so it wasn't the son of man's life he gave and then they got another another life somewhere else um no because when he went to the garden of gethsemane that had that had that had what had protected him all those years for that three and a half years that ministry that anointing that power that he was given because remember when he was on the cross he said he said he said in other words where are you father where are you at yeah you know in my words it'd be like if if i had this superhuman anointing and here i went through life for three and a half years and nobody couldn't touch me i could walk through people you know right through the crowd and they wouldn't know me and and i could go do this and i could go do that and i could just command people to be healed and all of a sudden they got me hanging on a tree where did it go my god my god why is thou forsaken me in other words what you if i was to give josh everything in the world and all of a sudden i left him somewhere in the desert that'd be the same thing you'd say to me he said father why have you forsaken me why have you left me out here with nothing to do but it wasn't his will he gave that will up in gethsemane remember the prophet said that he had more he fought it out in gethsemane the cross was just what he did to to consummate but in the garden of gethsemane because what left him that same anointing that came on him there at the river jordan that anointing for his message left him right remember he didn't have nothing else to say after gethsemane right he didn't have anything to say a pilate would say something to him he said you say you say unto this end i was born he didn't have a message anymore he was finished that message was done but the the job wasn't finished right he had already sown that message and that message was now in the hearts of those disciples right amen they were in the hearts of their disciples he had sowed the seed word somewhere and then he had to die to release that life to quicken that word that they held all right now same thing happens to me and you you got to hear the word of god before you can be born again amen you can't just holler and scream i'm in the message you got to hear the message amen it's not just the message come on brother all right so he died the son of man now that's when he was on the mountain in matthew 17 he said the son of man until he be risen again right so he died the first time a natural death there was no life in that flesh when they put it in the tomb right right right not a bit of life nowhere come on but the son of god just removed himself from that shell right and continued his work right because he had to go to hell he couldn't go to hell in human flesh he had to go to hell as the son of god back in the old testament because who did he go to he went to the souls that were lost in noah's age all those people that billions of people that died during the flood he was down there saying hey i'm the man right but there was no difference from that man laying in the grave except for the age because when he opened the door of paradise remember what abraham said he said sarah that's the man that we ate calf with right ezekiel the same ezekiel right here said oh that's the wheel in the middle of the wheel what jesus christ amen he was in spirit theophany form in the old testament so they knew who he was they identified with him by the way they saw him in that old testament right then he carried them up and then come back down to live for 30 40 days with the people right but in matthew 28 18 he said all power in heaven and earth right has been given unto me and he said go into all the world in other words let me rephrase that he said all power heaven that's been given to me but in about 10 or 11 more days you're going to get that power all right but what you're not going to do is you're not going to get the mystery of who this man is this son of man all right because in acts 1 remember in acts go turn to the book of acts and let's read that real quick in acts 1 remember while he was still alive they were still asking him questions about what are you going to do you're going to leave us here you're going to restore the kingdom what are you going to do jesus told him he said what go and wait right go and tarry but you shall receive verse 8 power after after exactly we are powerless without the holy ghost folks we are powerless amen without the word of god alive in our life but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and judea and samaria and here we are unto the uttermost part of the earth amen and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight that was the son of man leaving right then the human flesh son of man jesus christ was coming up off the earth right and you're not going to see that part of that man in that form until what the millennium and we're going to see him in the air all right but he's not going to come back down on this earth in that physical form one man until the millennium right right all right but that doesn't mean because remember he said go to jerusalem and i'm going to give you this power right so he didn't just take it with him donny he sent it back glory and while they looked steadfast toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white raiment and white apparel which also said you men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven right why do we pray why does all them ball players when they do something good they go all right because they think there's a god well i'm on video they think there's a god up here and i and i'm not i'm not criticizing people there's a lot of people pray like this but he's not up there right he said the men say why stand ye gazing up into heaven they're asking the people a question this same jesus which is taken up from you this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven now that to me has two parts one part is every eye is going to see that man one day coming in the clouds of glory like they all say you know the old baptist said to me one time he said i'll be glad when that old eastern sky splits back and and god and you know jesus walks out of that cloud just walks right down on the earth and just takes over and i just let him go i should have said well that you missed it if you see that you missed the real coming that he wanted you to see because the real coming is when he come again remember he said when the son of man is risen again come on that's when he'll come back in power and authority all right so now here we go in number 12 we're about we're okay the holy ghost is the son of god understanding right we we say we sing i want to see you c means to understand right you're really singing you want to understand him because look we will not see him in human flesh like they saw him on the earth 2 000 years ago until we meet him in the air so let's don't look for jesus christ in one literal form to to come appear among us he is now and always will be multiple foreign that genesis 1 26 and 27 has now been made manifest right when he come on the earth he was one man that genesis 1 26 and 27 that theophany was right there with that man jesus christ and that's why that when brother branham said we walked with him on the shores of galilee we were inside of him that was the eternal life that man had you were not in there as a little seed or a little germ or a little bitty theophany running around in his body somewhere you were in seed form in the word that he was amen seed form in the word he was not from the loins of man anymore it's from the spoken word and that's what he was doing he was speaking the word because what called you right what called you to repentance something jesus said or something the apostle said that jesus said that's what brought you to repentance you saw a god that came and died for your sins that was the word calling your name back to the predestination right that's what called you and you accepted it right all right but here we come down through the church ages now in revelations 1 let's go to revelations 1. everybody all right see i can see more and more now brother nick how we used to talk before about saying jesus jesus did not get anything right we always like to throw that off kind of sad that we kind of throw things off on denomination we really shouldn't jesus jesus was with his own disciples with his own people and one of them is one that portrayed him that's right okay so let's don't throw off and say well in plural denominations and that's true and i've been accused of doing that and i apologize because god can work in many mysterious ways all right but when you come down to it you can be in this message and say jesus jesus you're not getting anything amen because when god moves from that son of god dispensation over in the son of man dispensation and that's going to be an individual thing it's not going to be 1994 2010 2011. when you say dispensation everybody said well that's from the 40s to the 50s or the 50 no in god it's an individual affair you can be sitting here tonight and if you're born again tonight listen if you're born again tonight you do have the understanding of the son of god because you understood that what happened to that man god was in that man that man died for your sins amen that was almighty god and some way brother and this is a quote brother brown said some way he got back down in your soul because i was unredeemable and so were you but some way god came down through there and birthed himself into me amen and that's the son of god revelation and that's the son of god understanding so down through the seven church ages that's what they got but that didn't leave the son of man out and everybody's like well the son of man only appeared in this generation well now in revelations chapter 1 verse 13 it doesn't say in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the son of god right god was in human flesh the whole time amen paul peter james john amen all the church age messengers that was the son of man working in the people because they were god in human flesh but they didn't have the understanding for that right luke 17 30 had not been fulfilled yet god can't go past his word once he said in luke in the days and you know in the days of just like it was in noah's day just like it was in sodom's day just like it was in lots day that day hadn't started yet right and it wasn't a day like a 24-hour day it was a day that you and i stepped into it okay everybody understand it's the day that you're living in now we're sitting in the son of man dispensation but you may not be but if you're born again you at least have a revelation of what that eternal god did for you and that will birth you into the body god just claps his hand and says thank you i'm going to put you away not put you away like divorce you but put you away and protect you amen because i'm gonna put you in the grave and i'm gonna let your body rest for a while but that soul is gonna be a part of mine i'm not ever gonna lose it jesus told him he said whatever the father's got he won't lose one right what that genesis 1 26 man amen he went out and found that genesis 1 26 man on the earth and that's what he's doing now right he's finding those people and he's bringing him back to what to that one form not that we're going to be just one big theophany no he wanted us remember he wanted us to be male and female created he him right he created them male and female that's the way he wanted it all right but he couldn't do it because what happened in the garden but he's doing it now amen so it was the son of god understanding down through the church ages but it was not just the son of god working because we see in revelations chapter 1 verse 13 says in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man so it was god in human flesh working through those people amen doing a work so you can't say well all they had was just the son of god revelation they did only have that but it was the god in human flesh you can't do away with the god in human flesh that's why i like this quote when brother brown said he was son of man prophet he was son of man sacrifice he was son of man priest he son of man king son of david sitting on the throne son of man god manifested that son of man he came down and became man to take sin away from the world he became a man as a prophet man as a priest man is the king king of heaven king of saints eternal king always was king always will be king eternal king that's the son of man he'll never lose that flesh right that flesh will always be there so he didn't lose it through the church ages what was lost right the son of man revelation was taken away from the church because of one thing you and i were not there right that'll either humble you or it'll blow your head up and if it blows your head up then you don't have the one inside of you to keep you listen queen of sheba 1960. brother branham said jesus says as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man look at that angel down there to the church elect to what he done look at jesus what he's done in his generation look down here at this generation what he's doing now they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it right there you are but it but it comes just the same an evil and adulterous generation will seek after a son and they'll have it it'll be given to them as jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection sign is given to the church in this last days amen and the angel of the holy spirit in the meetings in the meetings showing the same thing doing the same thing across the nation proving that jesus christ is raised from the dead just the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that will receive it right all right let's continue on watchmen what of the night 1967-22 oh you morning stars rise and shine it's time to shine the coming of the lord is at hand reflecting his presence reflecting the oncoming sun giving the same sign jesus said as it was in the days of sodom it'll be the same thing in the coming of the son of man the same ministry that the sun went down in s-o-n this s-o-n the same ministry so there it went down again down to the church ages what happened they eat away and eroded the word of god so much to where there was just enough light for people to squeeze in and get that son of god revelation that that was jesus christ and that man died for his sins and that had to be god because he rose again and he rose up and he come back to give you and i eternal life that's the life they had right right everybody with me okay not to do away with the son of man but that's the only revelation they had was to come as the son of god to give the people eternal life but he says the same ministry that the sun went down in the same light he went down in is coming again in the resurrection power and the morning star is reflecting that light then we cry watchman one of the night so what happened was down through the church ages he was buried under denominational creeds and our ideas amen that's what buried him but he was promised to come back in the end time because the son of man according to matthew 17 has to be risen again to see that vision which is what elijah moses and the son of man glorified amen only in this day do you have those three on the scene at almost the same time you have who you have elijah through brother branham bringing the message then you have elijah and moses going to the jews then you've got the glorified son of man which is his bride in that time glory you can't glorify the son of man if he's dead does everybody understand that the people that are in the grave right now from this present moment back got a revelation of the son of god that that man died for their sins and they are eternal now their flesh is in the ground but their soul is in the sixth dimension does everybody understand that they did not get the revelation of the son of man because the son of man cannot die he died one time the bible says for all right and the bible cannot duplicate itself or god can't go over his word and say well no i'll do it no he did it one time amen but we killed him in the spiritual form we killed that son of man revelation they just it just went down with all these creeds you don't have to do but what happened now all right we're at number 15. brother branham when he came i'm setting all this as a basis because a lot of people in the message and i don't some of you sitting here may be the same way do not see the importance of the seals but you have to have a revelation of the son of god first god's not going to speak to you any other way then what's inside of you but the revelation of the son of god is going to put you in a grave let's just be plain let's just talk plain tonight okay and just because you hear the message and you hear brother adam say son of man son of man you hear everybody preaching son of man son of man that's okay but unless that revelation comes to you then you're gonna go you're gonna die right you're gonna die you gotta die because you don't have enough revelation to bring that body to a change come on that's it and i said revelation right exactly okay to bring that that's why folks that and i'm and i was and i didn't go into detail like i did tonight with the with a sunday school class but if you don't get the son of god the difference between the son of god and the son of man dispensation or revelation i hate to say dispensation because that everybody puts things in a slide i just say revelation without the son of man revelation we're all going to die i don't care what your name is that's right that's why brother branham had to spend all the look at all the years he spent from 47 to 63 restoring back that son of god revelation pure enough to where god could come on the scene as the son of man and do the work just like the old testament prophet spent all those thousands of years doing what getting this earth ready for the son of man to come on the earth right they built the body they're the ones that set the platform brother brown said they they laid that foundation for that son of man to come on the whole old testament so it is now folks the son of man died one time amen but we killed him in our own ideas we killed him in our own denominational thinking and now let's declare that he's risen again amen but you can't just say it because that'd be just like ezekiel prophesy son of man right man what's he doing he's saying it's gonna happen to somebody else when you prophesy it's happening somewhere else but when you become the prophecy see jesus said this vision tell this vision in other words brother dean they were there in that vision and he was telling them he said tell this vision to no one right until the son of man be risen again peter james and john could have went and told that to a million people they would not have understand understood what happened on that mountain that day even peter saying now i got a more sure word of prophecy he stepped in that son of god revelation and saw that that was something going on but he couldn't put it together like we put it together he could put it together like this little prophet that brought this word of god and opened our eyes exactly but he spent turn to luke 17 and we'll finish he spent all that time because he had to bring back a group of people to the pure revelation of the son of god right exactly because part of it had been lost in father son and holy ghost baptism in eternal hell that they preach and all those things that was still under the son of god dispensation but in chapter you know we always read luke 17 30. but did you read the whole chapter because the whole chapter actually starting at verse 20 and if you'll go back in your mind in in luke uh 17 20 this actually even schofield doesn't pick this up that actually parallels matthew 24. yeah because you go to matthew 24 it says what low christ is here don't go because you know where he's at right then he says where the carcass is the eagle will be gathered right right talking about the son of man going from the east to the sunshine from the east to the west that's matthew 24. let's listen to this and see if this is not the same thing this is luke's part of it and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say lo here or low there for behold the kingdom of god is within you amen pretty strong statement but that's exactly what matthew 24 was saying lo here is christ remember they say lo here is christ over here over the sea but don't go there because he's not there you should know where he's at if you don't know where he's at you're going to go looking for it right all right that's why the foolish virgins were caught outside they went to look for something they didn't have all right and he said unto the disciples the day will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it right and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them same as matthew 24 for as the lightning that lighteth out of one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day now remember matthew 24 says as the sun shineth from the east to the west right son of man revelation started in the east he was the son of man that's where he started then he come all the way to the to the west to where we're at now but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation but and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man now he's not talking about him standing there because there's not a flood coming and listen to this look at number 27. i want you to look pick up something they did eat they they married wives plural they didn't marry women they were marrying other people's wives plural now that's happening now in this day they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build them same as today but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and that day he which shall be upon the house top and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that's in the field let him likewise not return back right now we know what happened to that literally jesus was telling them to get out of the city right remember when titus was coming around the city he said don't you know he said in other words whatever you're doing your flight not be in the wintertime or you you know your women be pregnant and all that stuff that's what he's literally telling them but he's also telling us something all right remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it i tell you in that night now brother brown said that was the darkness of night this this age i'll read the quote in just a second i'll tell you that in that night there shall be two men in one bed one should be taken the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together one shall be taken one left excuse me two men shall be in the field one taken one left and they said unto him prayer lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is see there were the eagles together together now schofield picks that up like uh brother dale was talking about that says to see it armageddon but wheresoever the carcass of the body is therefore the eagle will be gathered together in other words in this day in this hour brother branham and abraham restored in long beach california in 1961 he said notice what was it god in human flesh and god would represent himself again in human flesh just before the coming of the son of man what flesh your flesh my flesh god coming now did you catch what he said let me read that again and god would represent himself again in human flesh just before the coming of the son of man right what flesh your flesh my flesh god coming down from heaven god longing for fellowship how people it seemed to be like there's so much mental theology about it you fail to get the discernment of the spirit now let me read one more jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever grand perry grand prairie alberta 1961. what did our lord say as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man what the evening lights promised to the gentiles the same god that manifested himself there in a human body and disappeared in a moment that same god would manifest himself in a people human flesh in the form of the holy ghost right you can say the holy ghost in the form of human flesh right he said human flesh in the form of the holy ghost of believing people in the last days at the evening light jesus said so what to the gentiles the seed of abraham which was many nations jesus in the gospel had four titles we brought that out son of david air to the throne so of abraham the royal grant son of man heir of the earth son of god heir of all things the royal grant and the old testament property could not be held any longer than 50 years it could not be annihilated from its original owner but 50 years and on the 40th day he paid the price on the 50th day the redemption and the power that belonged to the church that was lost in the garden of eden right was redeemed back and sent to us by the baptism of the holy ghost on the 50th day all right so now a few things you bring the son of man dispensation bursts you into the body gets you into the kingdom of god but now there was a time that we must and i don't want to say move on from that but we need to move on from that not forgetting the foundation right but building on it and moving on right man we went around this mountain too many times i think it's time that we ought to be looking at the son of man in a revelation not like we've seen before yeah the seals came in 1963 i believe christ did come down in a cloud like those two men told the people said hey you see this man going up the only way you're going to see him is when he comes back in the cloud you saw him go up the cloud you're going to see him come back in the cloud see they missed that coming you and i are the only people that gets that coming but it's still we can say that we can say that but the revelation of those seals is the only thing that's going to change you know that's the only thing that's going to change our literal bodies brother brown said malachi 4 is to do two things remember one do just what i said bring the son of god dispensation back into power where all things are lined up straight where god can work in his church again amen all right but then what bring the mysteries of the seven thunders the things that man had never looked into and then that would literally turn us back remember preach that literal doesn't mean prophecy or prophesying of something it means you are it amen when it says literal that doesn't mean there's something coming that doesn't mean like a metaphor or or something that we're using as a type because you and i now if we're types because remember satan types after god and that's exactly what he's doing now and i wrote down the last thing please god don't let this be just head knowledge right yeah even born again i ain't talking about just sitting there without the new birth i'm talking about even born again let's don't let this be head knowledge because we're all getting older the fight's getting stronger but god's not getting any weaker right we may think he's gone but i think he's here but let's just not let this be head knowledge glory let's take this and look at it in a light we've never looked at it before i told the sun to class i said look i said i'm pretty plain most of the time and i'm going to be very plain if you're going to come to the sunday school class come every time if you're not don't because i'm not going to back up and have to review i've only got 30 minutes and i it's hard to review and then start over something and i'm not saying that but let me tell you something brother brown said one day your job will not be important right your job that's what he said your job won't even be important if your job gets in the way of the word of god then you need to get rid of your job got to give you a job i promise you he will he'll give you a job something will open up but what do we do what do we do we do the same thing we've been doing we just don't stop remember in the in the bible study if somebody was saying oh sister trudy was saying something she'd done and somebody was watching her and you know she's backslidden hey we all backslide brother i'm saying we backslide every day but if we do something wrong the the test of a true christian is is and you may have a lot of jobs accusers out there that see you fall but what they don't understand is is when you come back the next week and you're not doing what you did before right but you're have a repentant heart and you're thanking god for forgiving you your sins you know it's kind of hard i told the people one time one of the people at work i said you know man the kind of job that i do is very stressful and it's very thought invoking you have to think all the time because i'm actually doing three different jobs but i enjoy it but still if you make one mistake man is ready to fire you but if you make a mistake in god or it's like i told them i said you know you counsel people that are murderers and adulterers and and god forgive them i said we can't forgive somebody for writing a number down wrong i said but yeah you're going to church every day asking god to forgive you those hideous sins that you do and you're condemning a boy for writing a you know flipping the numbers from one to two it should have been 2-1 i said what do you mean what kind of importance are we putting on all this i told them and i was just plain one day i said look all this that y'all think so important is one day gonna be dust and when this thing goes under it don't matter how much money you got it ain't gonna be worth nothing it's just a piece of paper so you can't serve god and man at the same time but we can understand going forward let's stand going forward let's let's realize that we need to know more about god excuse me let's realize that you know what there's more of god to know and let's realize that a prophet brother branham has already brought all that we need because let me give you a little key it really helped and that you know and uh sometimes you know you you think back on things and brother dean told me one time when i first started coming back to church he said you need to listen to those seal tapes he said that's a good foundation for you to start on he said you've got a good knowledge of the word he said in so many words we were talking to hunting you know before and i think god kind of vindicated us seeing deer and stuff anyway it was just something private between us but he said you know he said you need to listen to them those steel tapes you need to get a foundation you need to get some way to start and you know the first seal there's one mystery that's a mystery of iniquity that's knowing to do something right and you don't do it or knowing you're do some doing something wrong and you won't do something about it you can't go no further as a christian than that first field you can't go no further than that i've that stayed with me for for all these 10 or 11 years that i've you know been a christian and in my walking god but you know what just be honest with you you try to talk to people about that and without a foundation they'll cut you off they don't know what you're talking about right well what do you mean the first seals when the seal was pulled back there was the antichrist riding riding away and i thought i thought yeah it ain't rolled away from you yet right born-again christians people i'm i want that to get that in your head we're not de-christianizing anybody right if you're if you have a revelation of the son of god and you're born again you're just as eternal as god is but you are going to die a natural death right somewhere somehow some way let's just look this thing right in the face unless we get a revelation of the seven seals and that thing becomes alive i sit alive in our life then we're going to have a lot of dirt pulled up sorry isn't that right people i mean that's the truth we know it's the truth in this church we've been taught but now it's time for us to live it that mystery of iniquity though can be done away by one thing confession amen and then move on to the next and then move on to the next and then move on to the next let's bow our heads just a second dear heavenly father we pray lord that as we sing the songs of zion that you'll come down lord and and not be just an onlooker lord but be an active participant in the rest of the service father we asked and pray that you would just keep the storm clouds back as we worship you lord and not have to worry about the roads being wet or or anything lord and all of us get home safe but i pray now that you would come among us lord in a special way that you would bring your power that scripture just keeps rolling in my head lord when you stood one day a mortal man that they went from mortality to immortality you were standing on the face of the earth right in the middle of satan's eden and screamed all power in heaven and earth's been given unto me and now i give it to a bride a church a people a people that i've longed to see father you've longed to see this day when you can reveal yourself in the most pure form not that you're not pure lord but our understanding sometimes have not been pure and the things that we've done in our life lord may it be a cleaning time that truly there won't be any iniquity in our heart there won't be anything lord that even father you told us that if we couldn't love our enemies that we couldn't get into your kingdom and father we pray lord that you would just bind all the powers of the principalities of the devil all the things that we do during the day that lord we need to ask forgiveness for that sometimes we let little things slip and slide and and see things maybe sometimes we're not supposed to lord we can't help the thoughts coming through our mind but lord jesus take them out and burn them lord send that cherubim that seraphim that seraphim down lord and let him burn that thing out of our mind lord cover us by your blood father we still need your blood until you come off that mercy seat father we still need the blood of jesus christ to cleanse us from all sin the father just blessed this group lord as we've seen it over the years people grow up lord we we sure lord want to see all of our children lord all of our brothers and our sisters and our family and our husbands and wives lord bound together by you lord not by a court of of discord or or some other thing that's come among us father we pray that that'll not happen lord that that we'll bind together in you father and get behind the pastor and be be good deacons and elders and and just be good people sitting in the pew father because we're the ones that operate your gift lord when the minister's standing here lord you're the one lord that that are standing here willing but sometimes we are not wanting maybe you
