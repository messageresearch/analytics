[22:27] the house of the Lord if you like
[22:28] turning your scriptures turn back where
[22:30] we've been reading revelations one and
[22:33] then we'll read from first Corinthians
[22:37] 15 revelations 1 1st Corinthians 15
[22:42] remember the fellowship meeting will be
[22:45] this coming saturday at brother
[22:48] Longoria's in alabama if you want to go
[22:50] with us make sure you let us know we'll
[22:52] be leaving about 12 30 11 o'clock 1030
[22:58] would be better and we always try to
[23:01] give a little time we leave early but we
[23:03] give a little time we can always stop
[23:05] somewhere and sit down better than we
[23:07] can push the hard trying to get during
[23:09] problems but it'll be according to the
[23:12] weather because they're supposed to be
[23:13] bad all week but we'll see about that
[23:15] okay so we'll just pray one for another
[23:18] men I think that's all we got two
[23:21] announcements to make revelations 1 1st
[23:23] Corinthians 15 father we thank you for
[23:27] an opportunity to be able to gather this
[23:29] afternoon we thank you for you loving
[23:31] your grace unto us thank you for your
[23:33] goddess your understanding most of all
[23:36] thank you for you cause without you
[23:39] there would be no hopes and what any of
[23:40] us would be able to do or anything the
[23:43] breath we breathe they are we breathing
[23:45] that air is this this has come for you
[23:48] and we thank you Lord just bless us all
[23:51] together now as we talk about you
[23:54] forgive our sins and listen that
[23:56] understanding do as you said in your
[23:58] word you would send your word and heal
[24:01] us so we thank you in Jesus name Amen
[24:06] first the revelations one
[24:13] says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[24:15] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[24:19] servants things which must shortly come
[24:20] to pass in the sentence signified it by
[24:23] his angel to his servant John the by
[24:26] record of the word of God and the
[24:27] testimony of Jesus Christ of all things
[24:30] that he saw this did he that readeth
[24:32] them they that hear the words of this
[24:34] prophecy and keep those things which are
[24:37] written our end for the time is at hand
[24:40] what is that time at hand remember how
[24:43] we brought it out the time to understand
[24:46] if there's ever been a time to
[24:48] understand I believe we're here don't
[24:50] you if not when are we going to get here
[24:52] you know we're all getting older and
[24:55] everything else flip them we better
[24:57] start depending on alright first
[25:00] Corinthians then 15 and we'll go over
[25:04] verse 23 to make sure you understand who
[25:07] is talking about whatever man in his own
[25:11] order Christ the firstfruits afterward
[25:15] they that are Christ's at his coming
[25:18] then come at the end when he shall have
[25:21] delivered up the kingdom to God now
[25:24] listen to the scripture even the father
[25:27] when he shall have put down all rule and
[25:29] all authority in power for he must reign
[25:33] till he has put all enemies under his
[25:35] feet the last enemy that shall be
[25:39] destroyed his death for he hath put all
[25:42] things under his feet but when he said
[25:46] all things are put under him it is
[25:48] manifest that he is accepted which did
[25:51] put all things under him and while all
[25:55] things shall be subdued unto him then he
[26:00] at that time or shortly thereafter then
[26:03] shall the Sun I will show himself be
[26:05] subject unto him that put all things
[26:07] under him that God may be all in all you
[26:13] may be seated the Lord at is blessing to
[26:16] the reading of the word
[26:18] now is to try to finish up a little bit
[26:21] of what we were talking about this
[26:23] morning and continue home I don't
[26:30] believe that God gained attributes
[26:33] coming into the world I believe he had
[26:36] all the attributes better and said that
[26:39] he was a father he was a here hyuna
[26:41] Savior but there was nothing there to
[26:43] make it manifest you know no wait or
[26:46] nothing but that didn't mean that he had
[26:48] to wait until he came here to be that he
[26:52] always was that that was a part of him
[26:55] see you know like that and then being a
[26:58] part of him we just see on this side the
[27:00] display of it all right now he never
[27:04] gained any attributes all right because
[27:08] he had those attributes okay now do you
[27:12] what I'm saying it wasn't display we
[27:14] know that but that'll be the key to help
[27:17] you to understand later in what we're
[27:19] talking about but yet still he never
[27:23] gained any and all so now he never loses
[27:27] any attributes know if he lose anything
[27:33] that it's not of God you know if you
[27:38] know what you say well okay we're going
[27:40] to do away with this but that would be
[27:41] doing with God why just like I am I'm a
[27:46] son of my father me I became a father I
[27:53] mean I came a husband when my wife and I
[27:55] married that made me a husband that this
[27:59] gave me a title me that would be there
[28:03] you know as a part of my life an
[28:06] attribute all right then I became a
[28:09] father buy my wife a night together that
[28:13] made me a father well that didn't change
[28:16] me the attribute was there in me but it
[28:21] was just not being displayed all right
[28:25] then I became a grandfather
[28:27] did that change me did that add to me
[28:33] anything different from what I was no
[28:38] did it take away anything no see now I'm
[28:42] a great grandfather well see that's
[28:46] that's something but and I'm still the
[28:49] same one you know it's not a whole bunch
[28:53] more that I've got to gang this or do
[28:55] this or do that and and it's not that
[28:58] God has to do these things and then one
[29:00] of these days so now when we get out
[29:01] into work that we're talking about it
[29:04] we've already done this but I'm trying
[29:06] to make sure you understand when we
[29:07] start talking at the end of the message
[29:09] about the sonship how it would be
[29:12] surrendered that God might be all in the
[29:15] hollers we've just read in the scripture
[29:16] don't look at something being done away
[29:18] with it's not when we get over on the
[29:24] other side we will have an eternity for
[29:30] taking on the eternal revelation run
[29:34] around said me of God we're just giving
[29:39] enough here to be able to go higher to
[29:42] be able to understand what he will be
[29:44] telling us then me all right how do you
[29:48] think we're going to get you so when
[29:50] we're gonna set a fire on file to fiddle
[29:52] around play harps or do something you
[29:54] know what no no it's gonna be a
[29:57] wonderful partaking probably said they'd
[30:00] be a message is here to be given all
[30:03] right so they must be more of God that
[30:05] he has not been not have not revealed to
[30:07] you or not it must be more than he's not
[30:10] even written in his word to be able to
[30:12] reveal or it would not be a message of
[30:15] Tara you would only be much already read
[30:18] see we're getting just enough here to be
[30:22] able to understand to keep that part in
[30:25] your mind now alright so now i have not
[30:28] trying to back up too far but to try to
[30:31] get a point to you me do we believe in
[30:34] eternal son ship that was the line
[30:36] point of trying to do brain fourth then
[30:43] we believe in eternal sons you know we
[30:48] believe in eternal God ship we believe
[30:52] in eternal God head those were the
[30:54] things that gave you this morning to
[30:56] read now you said well how can it be
[31:00] eternal Godhead rodel when you when you
[31:03] say that a son is not eternal now watch
[31:07] the point if it was something else going
[31:11] out of in going over you would be
[31:14] talking in the wrong way but who was
[31:17] that that was the creator that we were
[31:19] talking about this morning the
[31:21] descriptor said he created all things by
[31:24] our in Jesus Christ all right it wasn't
[31:32] that he was standing here and he sent us
[31:35] on over here no he went itself part of
[31:40] God went out went over into a situation
[31:43] or whatever you want to call it how can
[31:45] you describe it cuz this girl folks and
[31:49] we were talking that a little bit let's
[31:50] want to go you know that back before man
[31:54] could talk just put it that way you know
[31:58] we'd be sitting around and and I'd let
[32:00] your brother dick not go mm-hmm
[32:08] that's it mm-hmm he said mm-hmm well I
[32:15] mean him knows what we're talking about
[32:16] we're gonna get some D right what if I
[32:20] said mmm and he said um hey that would
[32:25] make a language right you heard run
[32:28] around say they don't matter what it is
[32:29] he said even goo goo gah gah gah said it
[32:32] meant something somewhere in those
[32:34] languages the and it's like I've telling
[32:37] sister on Trudy back here the other day
[32:42] it'd probably be easier to describe in
[32:45] her language what I'm talking about if I
[32:47] knew how to talk her language me if I
[32:52] knew how to if we were all Greek than we
[32:54] talk in Greek we wouldn't be using the
[32:56] words and terms we're doing we would be
[32:59] using it into a form of greater higher
[33:03] capability luck sister Trudy she's
[33:08] sitting there in the hype of her mind
[33:10] translates what I said say in her
[33:12] language the other half of reminders
[33:14] translating it into English so she has
[33:17] got a problem run Colette's languages
[33:21] words are what we have developed to
[33:25] describe right yeah it wasn't that God
[33:30] sent down to Moses in the beginning said
[33:33] Moses tell him that's lame cuz that's
[33:38] not his name his name is Jesus so when
[33:43] they got ever had he said no no no no no
[33:48] no well show me what it is didn't Jesus
[33:52] say I come in my father's night did his
[33:55] father's name is Jesus he said well
[33:58] that's just Jesus only stuff why when
[34:03] I'm talking about Jesus I'm talking
[34:05] about Almighty God his name is Jesus
[34:10] that's why they couldn't pronounce it it
[34:13] was there was no vowels and whatever you
[34:15] do it in English vowels you know the
[34:16] words
[34:18] there was no I a TI o use to go in with
[34:22] it so the best i could do with with j vh
[34:25] v then some is jv8 you but it's
[34:28] basically veggie of exp there was no way
[34:31] to pronounce that so he came up with a
[34:33] way to pronounce it and they made it
[34:35] Jehovah see that was a way of man
[34:41] expressing what they saw would you know
[34:44] what I like in the scripture I told some
[34:48] jehovah witness is that one day acid I'm
[34:50] a better job witnessing you are listen
[34:53] how do you say hey I said called you
[34:55] over the over Jesus of the new when they
[34:57] naturally backed up a little bit my set
[34:59] aside why don't you quote my gave the
[35:01] scripture can't remember it now but the
[35:03] stretcher says by my name Jehovah was I
[35:07] never known now that stretcher that's
[35:14] what the Bible says he won because it
[35:17] was known as Jehovah it was Jesus will
[35:23] you this Jesus no I've not Jesus only
[35:27] that's the true revelation of the name
[35:30] of God his name is Jesus but see if we
[35:34] look at it with words we try to express
[35:37] ourself or the words you've heard the
[35:39] prophet say how many times where he'd
[35:41] say like in the English language the
[35:43] word board do what does it mean no board
[35:48] so you can have a blank on the floor
[35:51] come on board pay your board cuz im
[35:54] bored no well to all of those words are
[36:00] the same thing spell side but I've told
[36:04] you now if we get to understanding then
[36:09] the before and the after that's why I
[36:11] invite you to read your word read the
[36:14] Bible read the prophets message that's
[36:16] why I don't give you one line quote it's
[36:20] easy to good darting out one line and
[36:23] give it to you and that's what most
[36:25] preachers dead they just quote one line
[36:28] at least give you the whole paragraph
[36:29] it's in because it won't work but you
[36:36] see the before and after explains it I
[36:38] say come on board and stand on this
[36:43] board and pay your board good on board
[36:47] with you now you know exactly what I
[36:49] just say it so the before and the after
[36:54] explains you so the revelation explains
[36:59] it all right and many of us would ever
[37:03] thought the name of God being Jesus even
[37:09] the Jesus not only people wouldn't they
[37:11] didn't come up with that that has come
[37:14] up with it is Jesus only all right but
[37:17] now listen we don't believe in eternal
[37:20] son not just meaning the Catholic
[37:22] way but we showed this morning where the
[37:25] Prophet was talking about the low-cost a
[37:27] theophany now if that was a god himself
[37:32] in another form then you have sonship
[37:36] that would be counted in your eternal
[37:39] sunshine form but if that's God in
[37:42] another form call her son how did the
[37:46] man know in the Bible then with
[37:49] Nicodemus nobody knew it the man that
[37:52] looked down in and they put their three
[37:53] men in the fire and he looked down in
[37:56] there and there was four never can
[37:58] answer and he said he's locked into the
[38:01] Son of God then why didn't he say laughs
[38:04] at her son of man because of the land
[38:10] deals with you in flesh he looked in
[38:14] there and he saw something right
[38:18] somebody right he knew the way then
[38:24] three guys got took care of would buy
[38:26] that one other one
[38:28] man right so then if he loved her he
[38:32] said he's like unto the Son of God could
[38:37] happen he express it he knew he was God
[38:40] right we were talking a little bit of
[38:45] lunch about it see so get the idea
[38:50] this is what I was trying to bring and
[38:52] it was the last part to try to get more
[38:54] and then we'll go into more what we're
[38:56] talking about then God display in
[39:02] another form a part of God went out
[39:06] where I said you can't explain it he
[39:10] said but that's just what it was alright
[39:13] that part of God now listen that part of
[39:16] God that went out was eternal now you
[39:25] listening the part that went out of God
[39:28] was eternal but when we look at it we
[39:32] call it son one because he's displaying
[39:39] an attribute of himself to be able to
[39:46] hit let you and I comprehend him right
[39:54] he's displaying itself in a way we look
[39:58] at it say like I said the King would say
[40:01] it's got to be God who would look at
[40:07] myself I see it I'm not supposed to be
[40:12] able to see God if I'd say sup it's just
[40:15] some of God sister human ways of
[40:19] expressing when when I'm talking about
[40:24] low gosh theophany Son of God going out
[40:27] as being the one that created all things
[40:28] I'm doing exactly what I said this
[40:30] morning that God created all things by
[40:35] Jesus Christ are in Jesus crap
[40:38] so when he went over it didn't empty up
[40:43] here as Moses they took the spirit off
[40:47] of Moses put it on 70 he never made
[40:51] Moses no less God could give everybody
[40:55] in the world today the bad gives one the
[40:59] Holy Ghost seven billion people did make
[41:03] him no less you know what it might get
[41:06] make him greater would make him no less
[41:10] you don't cut it up and running on say
[41:12] like an apple give out the Apple you
[41:13] right out of pieces you around Apple
[41:15] know when he broke the bread you just
[41:18] kept coming back and he needed it you
[41:21] could put a ton after they did take up
[41:25] twelve baskets one time they made over I
[41:28] guess you decided give a little extra d
[41:31] on way home but now listen so sonship is
[41:35] a display of God in a way to help us
[41:38] understand right free women so it would
[41:43] mean a way of displaying it that we
[41:45] could comprehend it all right it doesn't
[41:50] mean the sonship is eternal seed I don't
[41:54] don't lock your mind on then the sonship
[41:58] is a display right the eternal God is
[42:02] what you really want to say it buddy
[42:05] he's eternal the Sun is a display of it
[42:10] it was an attribute ur apart scene now
[42:14] one day we get to an a minute on for
[42:18] more then one day that sucks you that
[42:22] we're looking at to help us to
[42:25] understand now you get me the part we're
[42:28] looking at the help us to understand not
[42:30] eternal God the part we're looking at to
[42:33] help us understand well one day have to
[42:35] be surrendered good you can't have
[42:38] eternal sons here
[42:41] to your own locked on eternal son ship
[42:44] like the Catholics you're looking at
[42:46] Jesus but random was back before the
[42:51] world using the quotes before the world
[42:56] did you talking about son ship he said
[43:00] anything got a beginning to have an env
[43:02] so whatever came out the form now not
[43:06] the god that was the form but whatever
[43:08] came out on that God that you can begin
[43:13] to understand by spiritual I that will
[43:19] one day the rope broke right back to
[43:23] where it was that's why Jesus said I
[43:26] come from God I go to God let around him
[43:32] said he went up now what did he say he
[43:36] said he come right back down in the
[43:39] pillar of fire to Moses on the road to
[43:43] Damascus he said the same one that went
[43:46] up come right back down with the
[43:49] different God it's not a different card
[43:52] you see there'll be a time come when we
[43:56] will no longer need to say here is that
[43:58] right there be a time come we will no
[44:01] longer need a healer true but will that
[44:03] do away with that no because we'll
[44:08] always remember him as either will
[44:12] always remember him as your Savior it
[44:17] won't do away so surrender doesn't mean
[44:19] when I get back to that in a minute see
[44:21] it doesn't mean that it is mean i rake
[44:23] my hand and I submit to whatever that
[44:25] other it don't like I said this morning
[44:29] when you when you were soldiers you
[44:31] raise your hand that means you're
[44:33] releasing whatever you was and you're
[44:36] going to submit to them I don't shoot
[44:39] you'll se suncook because you
[44:42] surrendered the you become their
[44:46] property the colonel illustrations but
[44:50] what else to say
[44:52] he watch it now as we get to it see then
[44:55] the attributes of God will go about and
[44:57] eat this plate and will return right
[45:00] back to where they came from goes before
[45:06] the world ever begun he had these
[45:08] attributes it won't be doing away with
[45:12] it hey there was a day as I said then I
[45:18] became a father you know that never done
[45:20] away with my wife called me husband now
[45:25] today we don't talk in those terms why
[45:28] because she don't say to me husband
[45:33] right why she my wife called me day I
[45:40] called him mama she's not my mother I'm
[45:46] not her daddy but what does it mean it
[45:51] means we together have produced a family
[45:54] and basically everybody calls me papi
[45:59] the grandkids has changed that name
[46:02] about four times from papo to pop in
[46:05] coming out and that pops in that if papi
[46:09] and pops and and everything else but you
[46:11] know everybody knows who i'm gonna be
[46:12] talking about but Steve that didn't
[46:16] change me from being hurt but we just
[46:21] don't sit down and talk about now boy in
[46:23] it nice being husband wife ain't nice
[46:26] meme husband one now we talk about ain't
[46:28] it nice being grandmother and granddaddy
[46:30] then and you know great-grandmother
[46:32] right when Daddy just moved up and
[46:36] that's carnal but that's the way God is
[46:39] see to her I'll always be a good husband
[46:41] to the children I'll always be their
[46:43] father to the grandchildren I'll always
[46:45] be there their grandfather and the great
[46:48] grandfather to do you know the great
[46:50] grandchild but each one will one day be
[46:54] incorporated right into our is broke
[46:57] right back
[46:57] into where it come from Jesus if i come
[47:00] from gonna go to God see I got to try to
[47:04] explain go what can we do the word son
[47:11] it means a beginning that's what it
[47:18] means son means a beginning an offspring
[47:22] but it means a beginning huh so as long
[47:27] as we're dealing with sonship and we
[47:31] will deal with sonship as long as this
[47:33] world exists on now we showed the other
[47:37] night about it when you go into the
[47:39] Millennium some things will be done away
[47:41] with but you know sometimes won't be
[47:45] done away with the win would go into the
[47:49] future home then it can all be in on now
[47:55] and with what I was trying to get
[47:57] through this morning but I want to talk
[48:00] about something to try to help us
[48:04] because we read here in the scripture in
[48:06] Corinthians the tables of kingdom that
[48:11] was a kingdom of God right now see
[48:16] here's where people get and it really
[48:17] irks me I've heard of in this message
[48:22] argue over whether it was a kingdom of
[48:24] god ur kingdom of heaven according to
[48:26] the Bible it taught both of them
[48:28] together and brought around them never
[48:29] distinguish between the two as being one
[48:31] of this way one of that way he will
[48:34] enter or release the quotes backward and
[48:36] forth of the scripture and so does the
[48:38] scripture has to be the son but there is
[48:40] arguments about that one is the kingdom
[48:42] of God the other one is the kingdom of
[48:44] heaven when we read here in the
[48:47] scripture that says that then come at
[48:50] the end when he who
[48:56] Jesus Christ to have delivered up the
[49:03] kingdom to God even the father huh now
[49:11] he's going to deliver that up so let's
[49:15] talk about a kingdom and we know that
[49:20] we're kingdoms come from the word like
[49:22] domain it can be used as the work throne
[49:25] we will try to enter relax both of them
[49:28] and all of it together in a few minutes
[49:30] Bedford it for you to understand but
[49:34] here in the end time there is a kingdom
[49:37] that is to be surrendered earth turn
[49:42] over what is that Kingdom now according
[49:49] to the Bible and according to the
[49:50] Prophet I gave it to you what to hold it
[49:52] uh-huh number one on your notes uniting
[49:55] one God one church 58 1221 the Holy
[49:59] Spirit is that Kingdom all right let's
[50:02] scan face through this cuz we're going
[50:04] to try to get through the earth all
[50:06] right the mark of the beast 1961 217
[50:10] says you're born into the kingdom I'm
[50:13] quoting run around the kingdom of God is
[50:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[50:17] dwelling in your heart the new birth all
[50:22] right now Jesus come to make away for
[50:25] the kingdom but remember this key the
[50:29] kingdom he was coming to make away far
[50:31] was not going to be his kingdom
[50:39] coasting might let you think it was to
[50:42] make the father's kingdom's right
[50:46] Jesus's kingdom and not the baptism of
[50:49] the Holy Ghost Jesus's kingdom as the
[50:51] millennial right we've got Luke it's
[50:55] goes in 90 minutes you got to come
[50:57] through so man to get her circles hold

[51:04] though it ended up saying this morning
[51:06] who he was he was what in body he was a
[51:10] man yes a create son but that's all and
[51:14] that spirit within that body would
[51:16] Almighty God right it wasn't that he was
[51:19] just a man and become a God later that
[51:22] would make him just like me and you I
[51:26] wouldn't make him all mighty glad to be
[51:28] able to die for us uh oh my god can't
[51:31] die forget it hey my god died at Calvary
[51:37] release the Holy Ghost to come out my
[51:39] god was able to take skimmed off of him

[52:19] 40 years old
[52:24] my own folks I was tried and everything
[52:29] I could to get it to you and what God
[52:32] revealed to me many many many years ago
[52:33] not on did say revealed all of it I
[52:36] didn't say that there's thanks keeps
[52:37] unfolding amen then his unfold I come
[52:42] back and preach it again the unfold I
[52:45] press it again because i want you to see
[52:50] it what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[52:54] brother branham 576 Christ mr. God
[52:56] reveal it's the Word of God make spirit
[52:59] and life in your own life it's a new
[53:06] birth what is the kingdom of God it's
[53:09] the new birth Jesus Christ as I said dad
[53:13] to release that life that was within him
[53:16] the dead spirit could go back to God who
[53:19] gave it but the Holy Ghost Richard room
[53:21] the soul of God who could come back on
[53:24] the day of Pentecost into that kitchen
[53:26] when the Holy Ghost and give eternal
[53:28] life to to a person making the kingdom
[53:34] but that was your father's Kingdom John
[53:40] 14 in my father's house are many
[53:41] mansions that we're not sure I would
[53:43] have told you I go to prepare a place
[53:45] for you to go to prepare a place for
[53:46] your kind of receive you unto us that
[53:48] owns a token man a kingdom they've
[53:55] already eaten argued over where jesus
[53:57] said the kingdom is within well was it
[54:00] here was it dire as right where he said
[54:04] is in healing amen right there there
[54:07] wasn't anybody else and right now I ain
[54:09] t no pen the man's argued that the end
[54:14] of baptism of the Holy Ghost seals you
[54:18] questions and answers the fourth one
[54:21] line number 41 you know she owed you
[54:22] into the kingdom me
[54:28] Jesus spoke about a kingdom did he come
[54:34] to help prepare but then he's began to
[54:40] speak about a kingdom that they could
[54:44] not comprehend right they begin to talk
[54:48] about his own Kingdom that's right it
[54:52] was so great until a woman one day she
[54:54] said Jesus could ask you questions just
[54:57] one sit in your kingdom in my sunset one
[55:04] on one side won't ever see they some
[55:09] caught on that he were talking about
[55:11] when he called it a split condition or
[55:13] two things one being the kingdom of his
[55:17] father that he come to display because
[55:19] an adopted son is to display his
[55:21] father's Kingdom he's not to display
[55:23] himself like I've tried to get you to
[55:25] see it the word manifest what is it it's
[55:29] to me made known we only look at signs
[55:32] and wonders and do it and John the
[55:35] Baptist never done one side and made God
[55:37] known brother you don't live in signs of
[55:41] wonder you're crazy I've seen things and
[55:45] told you about the things I've seen in
[55:47] my life Colangelo upward so don't throw
[55:53] things that made it I don't believe in a
[55:55] manifestation of God then you don't be
[55:59] silly but I try not to be I try to be
[56:01] honest with you but you see Jesus begin
[56:06] to speak about a kingdom
[56:10] neither the disciples so we would
[56:13] understand that no and then they would
[56:17] fall back to the natural and they
[56:19] thought goes the way he was talking that
[56:22] it would sound like something so natural
[56:23] until after this resurrection in the
[56:26] book of Acts they said are you going to
[56:28] restore the kingdom to Israel them they
[56:30] thought of him having some form of a
[56:32] natural kingdom he will one day but it
[56:39] wouldn't have manifestation then he come
[56:44] to bring the father's Kingdom John
[56:48] Matthew three and two John came out
[56:52] preaching repent for the kingdom of
[56:55] heaven is at hand Jesus in Matthew
[57:02] forward about 27 he preached the gospel
[57:06] of the kingdom I told her to stop was to
[57:11] go preach the kingdom of heaven was it
[57:15] hanging amen kingdom of God getting over
[57:18] heaven in which way he went to the go
[57:21] preach it like i said manifestation what
[57:27] did he do they made God known and God
[57:31] made them now Irish manifestation
[57:35] brother branham made God known and God
[57:39] made you know the signs and wonders
[57:41] because he couldn't do nothing by
[57:43] himself all right now you want to argue
[57:45] the point jesus said I do nothing till
[57:47] my father show you want to argue with
[57:49] the quotes where the prophet said it
[57:51] like this now give him to you the other
[57:52] day where Jesus didn't know about that
[57:54] woman when you come over and touched it
[57:56] he said be it unto you according to your
[57:58] faith he said because the father had not
[58:01] revealed that I'm quoting red around but
[58:03] said it the raloo term of laughter the
[58:05] father revealed him to go on and then
[58:08] come back the one of these days will
[58:11] understand reality see the kingdom of
[58:16] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:19] Luke 17 and 21 cities it is within you I
[58:22] said they argued about that below it was
[58:25] in him alright see it would come forth
[58:29] on the debt Pentecost the Romans 7 to 14
[58:35] and 17 you'll find it the righteousness
[58:38] and the peace and things of the Holy
[58:40] Ghost was preached by the disciples my
[58:43] cuz they were making their father's
[58:45] Kingdom our father's house our fathers
[58:48] strong make manifest that's what Jesus
[58:52] come to do he didn't come to do his own
[58:54] he told piloting in John 18 and 36 he
[58:58] said if my kingdom was of this world now
[59:03] in the minute we're going to get down
[59:04] and see his kingdom in about this world
[59:06] but he wasn't doing it then his wrong
[59:09] time he said it my kingdom was here I
[59:13] would my disciples would fight right
[59:18] right see in my father's house john 14
[59:22] he never spoke of his own when he get
[59:25] over the revelations 321 the red
[59:28] destroying that he says will sit with me
[59:30] in my throne as I have over come and sit
[59:33] with my father in his strong your throne
[59:39] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost his
[59:41] kingdom was a baptism with the Holy
[59:43] Ghost he all right he went to the
[59:47] Father's throne in the resurrection not
[59:52] yet he quotes that fort he's sitting now
[59:56] on the Father strong now listen to what
[1:00:00] I'm saying the literal body is sitting
[1:00:03] on the literal throne because that would
[1:00:07] be the father strong all right now I'm
[1:00:10] quoting rid of random all right but to
[1:00:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost they come back
[1:00:16] on a day of Pentecost is the father
[1:00:17] strung the new birth that's in your
[1:00:21] heart so he's setting in your heart by
[1:00:24] the new birth right
[1:00:25] but the literal body is not here
[1:00:27] corporal right knee read it now we got
[1:00:34] eaten number six on your note manifested
[1:00:36] manifestation of that resurrection read
[1:00:38] what the prophet said let's read the
[1:00:40] next one one of these I'd like to read
[1:00:43] but I'm trying to get time look at
[1:00:46] number seven on your notes well let's
[1:00:48] read number six why you turning night e
[1:00:50] 20 manifestation of that resurrection
[1:00:53] fifty forty eight or nine and he said I
[1:00:55] will return he's sitting on the Father
[1:00:58] strong tonight listen waiting to return
[1:01:03] to his own throne now worse David
[1:01:07] where's his throne yes David strong to
[1:01:11] rule and reign through the millennium
[1:01:17] now we've got to explain something right
[1:01:20] there Jesus has thrown is the Millennium
[1:01:26] the promise of the son David the David
[1:01:30] was promised that his son would sit on
[1:01:32] his throne Jesus Christ will sit on that
[1:01:36] throne he came and made way for the bat
[1:01:42] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:01:44] yielding it up he gave made it come into
[1:01:47] being on the day of Pentecost the Father
[1:01:49] strong which is the baptism with the
[1:01:51] Holy Ghost everybody I'm saying number
[1:01:54] done around there's a quote in here I'll
[1:01:55] give it to you then he sit down through
[1:01:57] seven church ages he said it's been sent
[1:01:59] of God he said but one day you'll be
[1:02:07] summoned David but now here's the key we
[1:02:10] got to understand jesus never declared
[1:02:16] himself there is a quote run around gave
[1:02:18] on it but remember he's not contrary to
[1:02:20] all the other that he said no brother
[1:02:22] branham said there's no word Jesus ever
[1:02:24] declared himself to be the Son of God

[1:02:28] these people say that Jesus say he'd
[1:02:30] said he witnessed Son of God said yes he

[1:09:25] millennium and son undated okay
[1:09:31] identified Christ of all ages 19 64 66
[1:09:34] 17 and then when he died rose and the
[1:09:37] syndics it back the holy spirit that was
[1:09:39] the son of God God is a spirit and
[1:09:42] through the church age it's been son of
[1:09:44] God and then in the millennium and son
[1:09:47] of David sitting on the throne ruling he
[1:09:49] has ascended up he that overcomes you
[1:09:51] sit with me on my throne is I have
[1:09:52] overcome and set down on my father's
[1:09:54] from he sitting on the Father's throne
[1:09:56] now but in the Millennium it sets upon
[1:09:58] his own throne because he is the son of
[1:10:00] David son of man son of God son of David
[1:10:03] see it just perfectly you follow thee
[1:10:10] mighty God unveil 64 629 then we find
[1:10:14] after his death Berlin resurrection he
[1:10:15] came on to their Pentecost in the Son of
[1:10:17] God God the spirit and the form Holy
[1:10:19] Ghost what was he doing he was changing
[1:10:22] himself make itself known making himself
[1:10:25] known to his people in a different form
[1:10:28] like to hold his spirit which is God he
[1:10:31] came to deal true that set to church
[1:10:33] ages the Son of God the Holy Spirit but
[1:10:36] in the Millennium he comes a son of
[1:10:38] David to sit on the throne of David King
[1:10:40] he wants to take the throne of David
[1:10:43] he's owned the Father's throne now then
[1:10:46] he said he that overcometh shall sit
[1:10:48] with me on my throne as I've overcome
[1:10:50] and said on my father strong during the
[1:10:52] Millennium he be son David what is it
[1:10:54] the same guard
[1:10:55] time just changing his mask all right
[1:10:59] one more this day the Scriptures fulfil
[1:11:02] 65 125 he came in three names he came in
[1:11:06] Son of Man which was the Prophet will
[1:11:08] what profit and that's what he did he
[1:11:12] proved his ministry but being a prophet
[1:11:13] we all know that there were one of us
[1:11:15] know he never said he was the son of God
[1:11:17] he said he was the son of man now today
[1:11:20] he is the son of God which you've
[1:11:22] returned back and now he's in the form
[1:11:27] of the Holy Spirit the unseen person but
[1:11:29] yet God the Son of God in the Millennium
[1:11:33] he sets on his Father's throne which
[1:11:35] he'll be Sunday he revealed himself
[1:11:38] first it's on a man a prophet this age
[1:11:40] through the church ages some in our
[1:11:42] trunk God and in the other age son of
[1:11:46] David three sons now watch it and you'll
[1:11:54] see what I'm talking about his kingdom
[1:11:59] was not set up on earth the father's
[1:12:05] kingdom was set up in the baptism of the
[1:12:08] Holy Ghost they come on a dip in ecology
[1:12:11] and through the church ages has been the
[1:12:14] son of God but a secret that none of the
[1:12:17] authors are writers show me one Joey one
[1:12:22] rider that had any common knowledge
[1:12:24] about it did Peter power any of them
[1:12:26] ever speak of son of man
[1:12:33] they didn't know that mystery you'll see
[1:12:37] all they knew he was so gone all they
[1:12:41] knew if you hold the old Jesus of the
[1:12:43] new but they didn't know the revelation
[1:12:47] and son of man neither did none of the
[1:12:48] scholar oh yes coalfield does a pretty
[1:12:52] good job of it but you see here come a
[1:12:55] little old man out need what did not
[1:12:57] window seals broke now starting to it
[1:12:59] when he come walking up their own land
[1:13:01] Ohio River it was just a little bit
[1:13:02] delete was talking about what as John
[1:13:09] the Baptist for run the first coming of
[1:13:11] Jesus Christ said your message will full
[1:13:14] run the second coming and he began to
[1:13:17] talk about the Son of Man and they
[1:13:23] couldn't comprehend that so God gave him
[1:13:27] two signs now what was those two signs
[1:13:35] me we call it taken by the hand and on a
[1:13:39] set another but what was he gave him two
[1:13:43] signs not only give you three don't
[1:13:45] don't brew women is just stay with me
[1:13:48] for a minute he gave him two two signs
[1:13:54] you know what those two signs were those
[1:13:58] two signs were the sign of the Messiah
[1:14:02] but a random head the sign of the
[1:14:06] Messiah because it was the Messiah son
[1:14:08] of me remember in every college chefs
[1:14:11] ungodly called herself son of man
[1:14:13] brother branham had the ministry of the
[1:14:16] son of man the unit's early ministry for
[1:14:19] the seals broke he was given two signs
[1:14:24] to show it then it went finally to the
[1:14:28] third son
[1:14:31] and what was it an opening to the word
[1:14:35] because his message never begun in 30 in
[1:14:41] 933 or 47 little message brother runs
[1:14:45] message begun in 63 when the seals broke
[1:14:48] now he says that not many he said not in
[1:14:50] the years of preparation but he said
[1:14:52] when he begins to sound his message go
[1:14:54] to do the rapture message and listen to
[1:14:56] it as I said this morning that was that
[1:15:00] split that he gave her in 322 of the
[1:15:03] seven I thanks 327 church age book where
[1:15:07] this messenger Malachi 4 is going to 2
[1:15:08] times 1 turn the hearts of the children
[1:15:11] father's back to reveal the thunders you
[1:15:16] don't read in Malachi folder that this
[1:15:20] messenger is going to to is the only
[1:15:25] said you turned the hearts of the
[1:15:26] children right it doesn't say to reveal
[1:15:28] the seals the bread around them knew
[1:15:29] what he was doing he knew what it would
[1:15:31] take like see so the kingdom Jesus was
[1:15:38] walking himself with the kingdom inside
[1:15:41] of him right there was no way for
[1:15:44] anybody to get it called scripture said
[1:15:46] God had died because the Holy Ghost had
[1:15:48] not been given you know the kingdom
[1:15:50] could come into being it was inside of
[1:15:52] him when he died he released that which
[1:15:55] is the Father strong kingdom and he came
[1:15:59] under their Pentecost and bent down to
[1:16:02] seven Church ages now watch how close
[1:16:05] it's getting look how close it got dark
[1:16:09] in brother branham no wonder people call
[1:16:11] him God right good as the closest thing
[1:16:17] it's you'll ever see of God before the
[1:16:20] resurrection the challenge I say that
[1:16:23] hopefully don't bother me I wouldn't
[1:16:25] dare to watch it but I've heard a lot of
[1:16:27] people talk about and I've heard a lot
[1:16:29] what he said
[1:16:31] and you know it be hard to try to stay
[1:16:34] away from believing he was God when
[1:16:36] every time he turned around he just told
[1:16:38] you what you're thinking what was going
[1:16:40] on what's wrong way and everything else
[1:16:43] and even said it one day he said you're
[1:16:47] closer to it to call me Jesus Christ in
[1:16:50] the Artic only the Antichrist and it's
[1:16:52] pretty good quote but we know it wasn't
[1:16:55] God but God was coming back to getting
[1:17:01] ready to set up his own King delight and
[1:17:08] that son of man the Word made flesh was
[1:17:13] the kingdom he had and it's going to
[1:17:16] return in a bride whether you believe it
[1:17:19] or I believe it it's going on it's going
[1:17:21] to be we may not be part of it that may
[1:17:25] be why we doubt it sometime that's all
[1:17:28] right it will be who's God's going to
[1:17:33] show for just a little bit now that
[1:17:34] ain't gonna be no gimped in hospital

[1:20:46] to go to work had to make a living and
[1:20:49] you know I I didn't have anything to say
[1:20:51] to him but one thing I look back a demon
[1:20:52] green message you ain't dead yet you
[1:20:56] know the man was honest he said Sam I'm
[1:20:58] sorry I didn't mean to say that about
[1:21:01] you that he was not cemented but you see
[1:21:05] I believe in that healer hey I know who
[1:21:11] the son of god he is but i believe the
[1:21:14] brown is to be the son of man in the end
[1:21:16] time to edit that's what's your prophet
[1:21:18] said go on letting them God go to the
[1:21:20] money guard on valency today you don't
[1:21:22] believe it i'll give you the front of my
[1:21:23] Bible let you read them all the
[1:21:25] priestess 1969 the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:29] would be the son of man that's the first
[1:21:32] sermon ever preached in this message
[1:21:33] Sherman is a preacher but you see he was
[1:21:41] son of man that was a way of or what he
[1:21:48] was displaying now when he becomes son
[1:21:51] of god did that do away with son of mine
[1:21:53] that's the point I'm trying to get you
[1:21:54] see no but he put it in a position that
[1:21:57] it wasn't may be used or whatever call
[1:22:00] far are doing or going on but here in
[1:22:03] the end time it starts coming back
[1:22:06] amen Lee why because he's going to his
[1:22:09] strong and he's got to get on the throne
[1:22:12] of your heart in the new birth the
[1:22:16] adoptions the things you've got to be in
[1:22:20] our heart me and I don't change the
[1:22:26] probably never talked about a change of
[1:22:28] dispensation from Son of God the Son of
[1:22:31] Man come on that's what people try to
[1:22:34] make it because he's still son of God
[1:22:38] just like he was when he was here on the
[1:22:41] shores of Galilee he was the son of God
[1:22:45] God manifested in flash try the Sun but
[1:22:49] in a ministry that was a son of man to
[1:22:52] be showing he was the god of the Prophet
[1:22:54] come on brother let's see down to the
[1:22:58] agency's been some of God then for a
[1:23:02] little while now it's beginning to turn
[1:23:03] back but that don't do away you know
[1:23:05] what does anybody take it saves you got
[1:23:07] to be so gone right see if I want to do
[1:23:10] away with something when we go to the
[1:23:13] when you go to the Jews and we leave out
[1:23:15] of here what's he going to be sunday
[1:23:18] view drive but you know he's got to go
[1:23:21] to them and Son of God to give them a
[1:23:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost then they'll
[1:23:26] see he's some of man and then they'll
[1:23:28] realize that he saw David so he's going
[1:23:31] to be son of David in the tribulation to
[1:23:33] the Jews but he won't be sitting on an
[1:23:36] earthly throne because it'll be two
[1:23:38] prophets in the tribulation you see how
[1:23:44] close it was from brother branham there
[1:23:45] was one prophet displaying this on a man
[1:23:48] maybe two prophets displaying this on a
[1:23:51] man for just a short period and when it
[1:23:54] does and it will go right on over the
[1:23:57] end of the millennium now what's going
[1:24:00] to happen it in now it's where the
[1:24:03] prophet comes into view with the
[1:24:05] scripture we read so let's read that
[1:24:07] scripture again now all right great
[1:24:09] things
[1:24:11] then come at the end all right when he
[1:24:17] shall have delivered up the kingdom to
[1:24:19] God who's that the Sun but that Sun is
[1:24:32] eternal life it's not as soon as we make
[1:24:36] it we're making words delivered up the
[1:24:40] kingdom to God even the father when he
[1:24:42] shall have put down all rule and all
[1:24:44] authority and power now he drops back
[1:24:47] he's up dar showing its all power or
[1:24:50] authority all room you know that jesus
[1:24:53] never said that he that all power is
[1:24:55] given unto me I until after his
[1:24:56] resurrection ricci powerful it was after
[1:25:02] his resurrection when he said all power
[1:25:04] is given unto me in heaven and earth
[1:25:06] because you better remember something I
[1:25:09] know I could say four hours more on you
[1:25:13] better remember that son of man is ruler
[1:25:16] of the earth so God is root of all
[1:25:19] things you better get the quote to the
[1:25:21] Prophet so David is just a millennium
[1:25:25] rain so god is ruler of all aims see if
[1:25:29] I'm right right your computer
[1:25:34] find out is right now we don't you turn
[1:25:38] something going to happen all right then
[1:25:41] come at the end when he shall delivered
[1:25:42] up the kingdom to God even the father
[1:25:44] when he shall I put that all rule and
[1:25:46] all authority in all power no there's
[1:25:51] one time that has not been destroyed yet
[1:25:54] and that's what he's talking about here
[1:25:56] hey Ben now in Jesus Christ all things
[1:26:00] was conquered right death everything was
[1:26:03] conquered but it's not into
[1:26:06] manifestation yet right cuz we're still
[1:26:10] here we're still getting older so listen
[1:26:14] for a much rain d who Christ Jesus
[1:26:22] Christ the Son of God all of these
[1:26:25] kingdoms were talking about all the
[1:26:27] things he must reign till he hath put
[1:26:29] all the enemies under his feet the last
[1:26:32] enemy that shall be destroyed his death
[1:26:34] words death destroyed it according to my
[1:26:39] understanding what the Prophet said is
[1:26:40] destroyed after the Millenium and two
[1:26:44] white throne judgment
[1:26:48] death is still taking its toll in the
[1:26:51] Millennium now there's nobody dying
[1:26:52] don't go quote me wrong nobody dies in
[1:26:57] the Millennium no but after the
[1:27:01] Millennium death will rain into the
[1:27:05] white throne judgment and death and I
[1:27:09] always both destroyed what last enemy
[1:27:12] that shall be destroyed his death for he
[1:27:13] had to put all things under him that's
[1:27:15] under him so don't wear out God has put
[1:27:20] it all under this runs here you're
[1:27:26] giving him all power all authority
[1:27:29] that's what he said when he raised all
[1:27:30] power and Helen earth red red said you
[1:27:33] Trinitarian said tell me where the
[1:27:34] father had any power left right because
[1:27:38] the Bible said I'll let him forget but
[1:27:43] all things under his feet God put it
[1:27:47] under Jesus Christ but when he said all
[1:27:50] things are put under him it is
[1:27:52] manifested he is accepted don't try to
[1:27:55] look that word up Webster coated ain't
[1:27:56] even though oh you can't find it
[1:28:03] Webster's dictionary find it better exc
[1:28:09] ep 28 ed it's a secret to their we did
[1:28:16] put all things under him and when all
[1:28:19] things shall be too subdued unto him in
[1:28:23] other words when everything and death
[1:28:25] hell everything it's a dude then shall
[1:28:32] the Sun all throw himself be subject
[1:28:35] unto him
[1:28:41] that put all things under him that God
[1:28:45] may be old and all is what I said I
[1:28:47] wrote these in my Bible right here I
[1:28:50] don't know 30 40 years ago I don't think
[1:28:56] really though I read them to you but
[1:29:00] listen to him one more time Chrysler mr.
[1:29:02] God reveal 1963 728 number 13 on you
[1:29:06] notes you might ought to read it and God
[1:29:10] at that day the kingdom be given over to
[1:29:14] the father he might be all in all well
[1:29:21] he's yet speaking out here days of
[1:29:23] Christ David sitting on the throne now
[1:29:26] where's that at millennium listen the
[1:29:30] king over the whole human race what do
[1:29:32] you speak of I know what they're
[1:29:34] thinking minds you let's draw like a
[1:29:36] bullet worth of that millennium right
[1:29:40] okay the sea it's not all done in the
[1:29:46] Millennium goes deaths not destroyed the
[1:29:49] millennia destroyed after mine it's
[1:29:54] destroyed for a spiritual by the baptism
[1:29:56] of the Holy Ghost for you and I yes but
[1:30:01] death and hell and all it's done after
[1:30:03] which is white throne judgment i'm glad
[1:30:06] i found this other one future home 1964
[1:30:10] 802 city with the throne in top now
[1:30:13] what's he told that they said in here
[1:30:17] revelation 21 23 so that's not the
[1:30:19] millennium millennium is 19 and riding
[1:30:22] in becoming and they need no life for
[1:30:26] the lamb and the Lord God is a lot birth
[1:30:29] the lord god is that pillar of fire that
[1:30:32] followed the children of israel through
[1:30:34] the wilderness he is ascended upon the
[1:30:37] throne in that perfect kingdom when the
[1:30:41] the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender
[1:30:44] to the father that God may be all in
[1:30:48] all Jesus sits on his throne here is our
[1:30:51] Joseph no sorry the bottom was cut off
[1:30:54] in a printing back door but I wrote it
[1:30:57] on the bottom of mine then the king is
[1:30:59] the light is that light that on top of
[1:31:03] Mount Zion and holy holy light will
[1:31:09] flood the entire city he's in that Alou
[1:31:11] you so make the call it all over to the
[1:31:14] future home oh no the future do you see
[1:31:28] what's happening the sonship will be
[1:31:33] surrendered I used to work use the word
[1:31:36] of terminate in no way that I ever mean
[1:31:38] terminate that's terminate like doing
[1:31:41] away with I explained it I didn't have
[1:31:43] that education I don't have it now but
[1:31:46] the scripture says that is you'll give
[1:31:50] up the kingdom the Prophet city of
[1:31:52] surrender the kingdom what's happening
[1:31:59] he there's going to come a time that God
[1:32:01] may be all in all the Millennium will be
[1:32:06] the first part of it and Jesus was set
[1:32:10] on his strong as son of David in the
[1:32:14] millennium and you and I will sit on
[1:32:17] that throne with him too sure that I
[1:32:21] gave you a couple of quotes down through
[1:32:23] that now they don't need no light of the
[1:32:27] scripture says the future home he said
[1:32:28] they don't they need no lot for the lamb
[1:32:31] is the light so the lamb is in the
[1:32:34] future home he won't say the lamb is in
[1:32:45] the future home so it's certainly not
[1:32:49] done away like tore up and burn up or
[1:32:52] left off and don't need it in the lower
[1:32:54] the lamb is the light in the future home
[1:32:59] what your profits is what your Bible
[1:33:04] says so don't put do away we'd like to
[1:33:07] do away with it say brother Dale done
[1:33:09] away with son few know what
[1:33:16] when it all comes back and makes that
[1:33:18] perfect circle not brother Dean rapture
[1:33:26] in a circle he comes all the way back
[1:33:31] because that's what he was preaching on
[1:33:32] years ago when it's all finished jesus
[1:33:38] said I come from God and I go to God he
[1:33:43] made a complete circle there had done a
[1:33:45] wonderful job there the other night he
[1:33:48] was talking about infinity and you know
[1:33:50] and they lay an eight you know it's not
[1:33:53] not an eight now to make two circles
[1:33:55] it's an eight where the lines go like
[1:33:57] this it's not two circles a that you
[1:34:01] talk about infinity it's it's this I'm
[1:34:06] going to told Aaron later I said if you
[1:34:07] just pull that apart and you know what
[1:34:08] you got you just pull it apart like that
[1:34:13] and you guys like this you pull it apart
[1:34:16] you got a perfect circle but that's not
[1:34:18] the point because of circles you're not
[1:34:22] getting nowhere right you're just going
[1:34:29] around and around that's our mind but
[1:34:33] infinity is made by the Sun you know
[1:34:36] what it means it means it's traveling
[1:34:39] you know what it means it's come close
[1:34:40] to crossing itself again it just didn't
[1:34:43] do it did you catch that point you
[1:34:48] stretch it out let's a circle but if you
[1:34:50] keep it in it like that that means
[1:34:53] travel circle you just going round round
[1:34:57] man go get no word if you doing like to
[1:35:01] that you getting somewhere you saw
[1:35:03] you're just going out away you don't get
[1:35:05] the point man looked down there one day
[1:35:08] in a vision and he saw wiggle in the
[1:35:11] middle of the wheels and this we were
[1:35:12] run by this and this running like that
[1:35:13] and brian says why DC he says how the
[1:35:15] children visual travel going down
[1:35:17] through the wilderness
[1:35:20] me you're not listening see the lamb is
[1:35:25] the light thereof that's revelations
[1:35:27] 21-23 sneak him in the future home and
[1:35:32] the city had no need of the Sun leader
[1:35:35] of the moon to shine in it for the glory
[1:35:38] of the Lord did lighten it the glory of
[1:35:42] the Lord and the lamb is the light
[1:35:45] thereof you remember I made the
[1:35:53] statement and so we're not going up to
[1:35:56] heaven and we're going to see a pillar
[1:35:57] of fire over here we're going to see a
[1:35:59] high level over here and we're going to
[1:36:01] see of Jesus over here now that's what
[1:36:05] the Trinity concept is me we're going to
[1:36:10] see Jesus when he said on earth he said
[1:36:11] if you seen the father you see me you've
[1:36:13] seen the father when we get dire web
[1:36:17] seeing the rents it when you raise that
[1:36:20] nail prints don't you think you'll still
[1:36:24] be that one because you're going to do
[1:36:28] what if sonship I'm not doing away with
[1:36:30] the thing if you're catching on what I'm
[1:36:32] saying if the lamb is the light then the
[1:36:36] lamb is in the future home but he's in
[1:36:39] tires a lamb running around no one of
[1:36:44] these days we'll find out what that lamb
[1:36:46] is and we'll find out that lamb that
[1:36:49] seven horns and seven eyes and that lamb
[1:36:53] come from the church ages including
[1:36:58] Britain
[1:37:01] but you see never did I have reference
[1:37:04] to what you're thinking then out
[1:37:08] référencement I made to hit your
[1:37:09] references you're not going to see three
[1:37:11] names I never I don't believe that we're
[1:37:16] going to see Jesus what's the problem
[1:37:18] with the line it says in Revelation 21
[1:37:25] 23 the glory of the Lord did lighten it
[1:37:29] let's just ignore the Lord lighten the
[1:37:31] city and it except in the lambeth alike
[1:37:34] they're up to have it is like the glory
[1:37:37] of this you know of God did the light of
[1:37:42] the lamb will see Jesus and know who he
[1:37:45] is the mysteries will be gone let's see
[1:37:51] I like this one there is one more to add
[1:37:55] door that it says that you know you know
[1:37:57] I've tried to preach to you have it when
[1:37:59] it over with that there be a message
[1:38:01] your cheer look up to top of the page
[1:38:02] number 15 on your notes which is one
[1:38:05] page one away to the church age book and
[1:38:10] now to these sons of God who buy him
[1:38:12] over come are given the privilege on the
[1:38:15] paradise of God in the constant
[1:38:16] fellowship of Jesus Christ there will
[1:38:19] never more be any separation from him
[1:38:21] whether he goes his bride will go what
[1:38:24] he is he shares with his glove on a
[1:38:27] joint our relationship the secret things
[1:38:30] will be revealed remember Deuteronomy
[1:38:34] 2929 secret things belonging to god but
[1:38:37] those things that are revealed belonging
[1:38:39] to you and me is that what it said
[1:38:45] this will be like him for we shall see
[1:38:48] him as he is but you see I do a lot of
[1:38:53] checking to make sure that when I say
[1:38:54] something that it all run across
[1:38:56] something don't crouch and you come up
[1:38:58] with it so look at the last one down
[1:39:00] there number 18 questions and answers
[1:39:02] and 1964 823 and he's explaining the
[1:39:08] glory and loosened the things has
[1:39:11] happened and always burn up not volcanic
[1:39:13] ash burned everything and I saw a new
[1:39:16] heavens and a new earth for the first
[1:39:17] heaven and the first earth were passed
[1:39:19] away and there was no more sea I John
[1:39:21] saw the holy city descended from God out
[1:39:23] of heaven as a bride adorned for her
[1:39:25] husband remember it and in this bride
[1:39:27] behold the tabernacle of God is with men
[1:39:29] and God shall dwell with them upon this
[1:39:32] pyramid-shaped CD 1500 we're miles and
[1:39:35] in the top of the city there will be a
[1:39:37] lot Amy now now look what he describes
[1:39:44] let's continue reading on top of Mount
[1:39:47] Zion will set the lamb and the city will
[1:39:51] note how no need the city will need no
[1:39:54] light for the lamb is the light thereof
[1:39:57] listen and above the lamb will be the
[1:40:00] father which is a low-cost God the great
[1:40:09] light the eternal light that has shined
[1:40:11] just above the throne and Jesus will not
[1:40:15] be on his father strong I never caught
[1:40:21] his ties to the future home what's it
[1:40:25] and Jesus will not be on his father
[1:40:29] strong he'll be on his drum work in the
[1:40:34] future home
[1:40:37] that's what your prof is read he'll be
[1:40:41] on with you strong and the father will
[1:40:43] hover over the Sun all in this
[1:40:47] trinitarianism now read the next few
[1:40:50] words which the father and the son will
[1:40:55] be one will be one farther in the Sun
[1:41:02] will be one cuz he's always been one
[1:41:04] amen we get dire it's not going to be
[1:41:08] that we're going to get there and God
[1:41:10] the Father is not right us nothing
[1:41:13] mountain so he's just so spirit float
[1:41:14] now that you hundred and we're going to
[1:41:16] all do this and then the other no no no
[1:41:24] the throne that he's on in the
[1:41:26] Millennium will continue right into the
[1:41:30] future home and it'll be in strong and
[1:41:36] then he's right you've seen me you've
[1:41:40] seen the father the lamb is the light so
[1:41:46] worth lamb the glory of the lord is
[1:41:49] divert the words not left is any problem
[1:41:53] we see it him standing there and maybe
[1:41:58] even let it make it a little bit to
[1:42:02] where we're at maybe when we stand there
[1:42:06] and see him you know they might be a lot
[1:42:08] laying over his shoulder you remember
[1:42:12] that
[1:42:14] the light that was over brother branham
[1:42:16] that took a picture wouldn't a great big
[1:42:18] halo in a great big circle up above
[1:42:20] human and looking like the Catholics try
[1:42:22] to draw it out and go all this stuff
[1:42:23] going on you know the one they took the
[1:42:26] picture of this hanging in Washington DC
[1:42:30] was a white looking light hanging over
[1:42:33] his shoulder will be no problem with
[1:42:38] Jesus standing there with that laying on
[1:42:39] his shoulder neither would it be any
[1:42:43] problem with the lamb being there
[1:42:45] because you and I are going to be that
[1:42:46] lamp tell that's where the lamb comes
[1:42:51] from great day for hoops come on let's
[1:42:58] hang this a little bit messy at home but
[1:43:01] state and have his ways and sunder
[1:43:03] whether we want to get home hey careful
[1:43:06] because don't take no change in weather
[1:43:09] it's why we do these things while we
[1:43:10] have our services close together where
[1:43:12] everybody can get home but think about
[1:43:15] him the lamb is the light of the city
[1:43:21] you know that lie to be just as great
[1:43:23] over you as it is over him if it took a
[1:43:28] picture over brother branham why
[1:43:30] wouldn't it be a picture be able to take
[1:43:32] it hanging over you and I let's stand
[1:43:35] together what would be the problem see
[1:43:39] if we did do away with anything did we
[1:43:41] we proved by the Bible of prophets
[1:43:44] message that even a lamb will even still
[1:43:46] be there then done wavelength time for
[1:43:49] the green we just let everything
[1:43:52] manifest itself and there's a time we
[1:43:55] don't need a healer but you'll still be
[1:43:57] there time we don't need a savior when
[1:44:00] you're still no attribute will be done
