[35:29] you just remember to pray for brother
[35:31] Dale
[35:32] and the Lord again strength he tends to
[35:36] overdo it sometimes so the Lord has to
[35:38] back his gear off a little bit maybe
[35:40] and let him rest for a little while
[35:43] so he's uh
[35:47] he's done he's done wonderful for the
[35:50] age that he is but he can still out work
[35:52] me at 20 years my senior so I don't uh
[35:56] try to keep up with it
[35:58] don't try to keep up with him preaching
[36:01] neither because my what's coming forth
[36:03] now church we don't need to miss we do
[36:06] not need to miss this this is important
[36:08] amen if you have your Bibles while
[36:10] you're standing let's turn to First
[36:11] Corinthians 2
[36:15] and this will be just for a thought
[36:18] to we get into it won't uh it'll have
[36:21] something to do with it but I want to
[36:23] get this thought in your mind
[36:26] uh before we begin and thank the Lord
[36:29] for these projectors
[36:32] sure help
[36:34] now a few things to remember we will
[36:36] have a baptismal service after
[36:39] all right after this afternoon this
[36:41] afternoon service a baptismal service it
[36:43] at Brother terence's house uh brother
[36:46] Chris I think is going to
[36:48] finally go ahead and
[36:50] do what he's supposed to do it
[36:52] be baptized and find him a name that's
[36:55] right you can baptized and get a name
[36:59] and then also remember my buddy out in
[37:01] Oklahoma brother Claude he had some
[37:03] fainting spells like on Friday I haven't
[37:05] called him back but uh they hadn't
[37:07] called us back so just remember him and
[37:09] they also bought a new church so just
[37:12] remember them and uh their Endeavors of
[37:15] putting it together and it's a really
[37:17] neat place
[37:18] but just keep them in your prayers they
[37:20] need prayers more than anything else and
[37:22] that's the same way with you and I money
[37:24] by a lot but prayers
[37:26] change things
[37:28] right
[37:29] First Corinthians 2
[37:33] unless fire headed before we get started
[37:34] up I don't think there's any other
[37:36] announcements we got Bible study coming
[37:37] up in a couple of weeks but uh just keep
[37:41] every one of us in our prayers ones that
[37:42] are not with us we got a pretty full
[37:44] house today but just remember the ones
[37:46] that are not here we're still on
[37:48] admission
[37:49] we're still on a mission to get those
[37:51] lost ones in not just in a church but I
[37:53] mean in in the bride all right get them
[37:56] in the safety and shelter it was good to
[37:57] see Brother David here Marlo hadn't seen
[38:00] him in a long time just pray for him I
[38:02] pray for each one and once they come in
[38:03] the door they can't leave they either
[38:04] leave Better or Worse right right it's
[38:07] going to really pound on him what he
[38:09] heard today so
[38:10] I hope God stirs his water that's right
[38:13] First Corinthians two let's bow our
[38:15] heads dear heavenly father we pray today
[38:17] Lord that you would father not be a an
[38:20] onlooker but become an active
[38:22] participant in this service father
[38:24] she would take over this lump of clay
[38:25] One More Time Lord and you use your
[38:27] words
[38:29] and let them be Lord heard
[38:31] with spiritual ears
[38:33] and seamless spiritual lives
[38:36] father we pray that you would forgive us
[38:38] Lord of our sins and many mistakes that
[38:40] we make Lord in life
[38:41] the mistakes we made Lord that we make I
[38:45] pray that you cover them by the blood
[38:46] father give us this day our daily bread
[38:48] Lord take care of each one of us you
[38:51] said you sent your word and healed us
[38:52] Lord so as the word Goes Forth may you
[38:54] heal each one father
[38:56] take this word now Lord and break it to
[38:58] each one Lord as you did there while you
[39:01] were here on the earth it kept
[39:03] multiplying and multiplying and
[39:05] multiplying father I pray that you would
[39:07] do that for us Lord be with the ones
[39:09] that are sick
[39:10] outside the building Lord that you would
[39:12] take care of them sin sick Lord
[39:14] mainly we want to send sick in
[39:18] we want them in the safety of not just a
[39:20] church but we want them in the safety of
[39:22] you father back in the Sheepfold where
[39:25] they should be Lord we pray that you'd
[39:27] touch each one now
[39:29] bless us you take over lord in Jesus
[39:32] name I ask him amen First Corinthians 2
[39:35] verse 9. but as it is written I have not
[39:39] seen nor ear heard neither have entered
[39:41] into the heart of man the things which
[39:42] God has prepared for them that love him
[39:46] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[39:49] his spirit
[39:52] isn't that correct only only by his
[39:55] spirit for the spirit searches all
[39:57] things yea the Deep things of God so
[40:01] there are deep things of God okay
[40:04] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[40:07] save the spirit of man which is in him
[40:09] in other words if you're carnally minded
[40:11] today and you only take this carnally
[40:13] minded you're going to get a carnal
[40:15] application that's right but
[40:18] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[40:21] but the spirit of God so if the spirit
[40:22] of God dwells in you today you will
[40:24] understand
[40:26] what's going on for your day and hour
[40:29] now here's Paul listen now we have
[40:32] received
[40:34] right can you say that now we have
[40:37] received that's right
[40:39] see Paul's not putting it off he's
[40:40] saying we've received something now we
[40:43] have received not the spirit of the
[40:45] world but the spirit which is of god
[40:49] that we might know the things that are
[40:52] freely given to us
[40:54] of God Amen let's read that one more
[40:57] time that we might know the things that
[41:00] are freely given to us of God which
[41:03] things also we speak so in other words
[41:05] brother sister
[41:07] it was not above Paul to speak these
[41:10] words right right
[41:11] that's what he said which things also we
[41:14] speak not in The Words which man's
[41:18] Wisdom teacheth right
[41:20] um
[41:21] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[41:23] comparing spiritual things
[41:25] with spiritual let me go and read 14 but
[41:28] the natural man receiveth not the things
[41:29] of the spirit of dying for their
[41:31] foolishness unto him
[41:33] today you mind some of you is gonna your
[41:35] mind's gonna wander that's foolishness
[41:37] that's right all right let's try to keep
[41:40] focused but the natural man receiveth
[41:42] not the things things of the spirit of
[41:44] God for they are foolishness unto him
[41:46] neither can he know them because they
[41:49] are spiritually discerned you may be
[41:51] seen the Lord and His blessings of the
[41:52] reading of the word and there's two
[41:54] things that I need to um
[41:56] to run by you while I got you here well
[41:59] I got a captive audience it's been
[42:01] brought to our attention that there's
[42:03] some of you children young adults have
[42:06] been chewing chewing gum and blowing
[42:07] bubbles and stuff like that in church
[42:08] you don't need to do that because the
[42:10] next time I see you I'm going to call a
[42:12] name from up here and if you parents
[42:15] can't look and see that your kids are
[42:16] chewing chewing got me blowing bubbles
[42:18] I'm going to call your name
[42:20] all right because we need to quit doing
[42:22] that I know we need to do that to uh
[42:24] okay we need to do that
[42:28] to keep the church clean we need to get
[42:30] not be a distraction
[42:32] we don't want anything we got enough to
[42:33] distract us anyway we don't need that to
[42:36] distract us and another thing if you
[42:38] look on those back two two or three
[42:39] benches back there it says only for
[42:42] children for parents and families with
[42:44] children okay so if you're sitting back
[42:46] there you need to move up front
[42:48] you don't have to do it today but that
[42:50] is reserved those last two or three rows
[42:52] back there are reserved for children and
[42:55] families with children so that the
[42:57] mothers can take them out that's why we
[42:58] put the sign on the side of the of the
[43:00] seat there and on the wall so you can
[43:02] see it okay does everybody understand
[43:04] that you're something that just rules
[43:06] that we have to follow
[43:08] so if you got children you can sit back
[43:09] there and that's fine but if you don't
[43:11] have children you need to settle them up
[43:12] this way all right that okay didn't hurt
[43:15] nobody's feeling that's just the way
[43:17] brother now wants and that's the way I
[43:18] want it so that's just the way it is
[43:20] okay uh if you got any better idea we'll
[43:23] put all the kids up front and all y'all
[43:24] on the back but that way gonna work
[43:27] so
[43:28] but just remember to do that just honor
[43:31] that way it keeps the kids in the back
[43:33] and and everybody's gonna have to keep
[43:35] running in and out running in and out
[43:37] running in and out from here back to
[43:38] there okay just keep that in your mind
[43:41] keep that in your heart brother dick
[43:43] said he wanted a report on South
[43:44] Carolina camp or maybe you all do
[43:46] everything went wonderful and well we
[43:49] survived
[43:50] we fed about 150 146.
[43:54] people 150 people brother Mark was with
[43:57] us and the Donnie and sister Susan and
[44:00] always join Gwen there and Joyce and dad
[44:03] didn't make it this time but we'll
[44:04] forgive them
[44:05] but uh and with anybody else
[44:07] brother Boyd and Sister Janet
[44:10] and Jason Rebecca came on Saturday and
[44:12] she brought me a documentary and I just
[44:15] praise the Lord for that
[44:19] because you need it when you lay there
[44:20] you need all kind of all the help you
[44:22] can get
[44:23] it but we had a good time uh we had
[44:25] exactly we had maybe like 40 or 50
[44:28] dollars left over
[44:29] so we had plenty to feed the people
[44:32] everybody had a wonderful time uh
[44:35] everybody was fed well and the services
[44:37] went really well until the power went
[44:39] off Sunday morning in the middle of the
[44:42] service and it was about 90 degrees in
[44:44] the sanctuary so
[44:47] yeah it was just the old devil
[44:49] but it was a good camp we had a good
[44:52] time and thank all of you
[44:53] for putting your time effort and money
[44:56] into making it happen again this year so
[44:59] you give yourself a hand immediately
[45:05] all right man let's get started
[45:07] and here in Corinthians let's
[45:09] we know for a fact and
[45:12] my brother and I were talking about this
[45:14] the other day and it's kind of hard to
[45:16] do I wanna
[45:17] I want to make sure that we understand
[45:19] one thing
[45:20] when I say that we're going to speak
[45:22] today on true seed
[45:25] now true seed does not mean that there's
[45:27] that there is a false seat all right
[45:29] there is a false seat but remember where
[45:32] we're going to read it in a minute when
[45:33] we put it on the screen but not right
[45:34] now where in Revelations it talks about
[45:37] the faithful and true witness Jesus
[45:40] wasn't a false witness right
[45:43] he was the faithful and true witness and
[45:45] we'll read in just a minute but I want
[45:46] to get these things kind of in your mind
[45:48] because
[45:51] I may be a little hard today because
[45:54] I want us to get something
[45:58] remember one thing if if we have the
[46:00] mind of Christ which we believe we do if
[46:02] we're born again correct we have the
[46:04] mind of Christ
[46:05] I was telling them down to Sunday school
[46:06] class this morning
[46:07] ever how little small Speck of the ocean
[46:10] you have you have all of the ocean the
[46:12] chemicals in the ocean so if you're just
[46:14] a baby born again baby today you've got
[46:16] all of God that you need amen but you
[46:19] have a journey that you have to go
[46:21] through all right so ever had a little
[46:23] speck of God if you have the mind of
[46:25] Christ which that's what Paul told us to
[46:27] have then you do have the mind of Christ
[46:29] if you're born again
[46:30] when you believe that you're you know
[46:32] your your um a newborn babe or been in a
[46:35] message for 30 years what does it matter
[46:39] right Paul says we must have the mind of
[46:41] Christ
[46:42] right now
[46:43] now if you paint the mind you take like
[46:47] brother Reynold made those
[46:49] um wonderful illustrations about
[46:51] Beethoven you take Beethoven if you take
[46:53] the spirit of Beethoven and I can't play
[46:55] a lick on the on the piano but if you
[46:57] took the spirit out of Beethoven and put
[46:59] that Spirit into me today I could go
[47:01] over there and I could create a a great
[47:03] Orchestra right
[47:06] and what about the mind of God glory
[47:10] what brother Dale's been preaching all
[47:12] these things we're going to say I'm
[47:13] going to try to tie a lot of things
[47:14] together maybe
[47:16] if you have the mind of Christ
[47:18] why can't you see my question is why
[47:22] can't we see I'm saying we why can't we
[47:24] see
[47:26] that we were back there nine people
[47:28] we're gonna read it right
[47:31] right but when you read the word of God
[47:34] that's not God telling you a story right
[47:44] a story
[47:46] all right
[47:48] that's God playing it out through you
[47:51] know
[47:53] come on people that's what we got to
[47:54] believe we can't keep putting this thing
[47:56] off over here that God's coming to
[48:00] no that's right
[48:02] if I took this book and I was the author
[48:05] of this book
[48:07] if I was the author of this book right
[48:09] here
[48:11] but brother Colin wasn't the author
[48:14] but he read the book
[48:16] it's just a good story that's right
[48:18] right that's right it's just a good
[48:21] story that's right
[48:22] right
[48:23] same way with the message book which I
[48:25] don't have oh there we go
[48:28] good story
[48:29] right man exactly this is just a good
[48:32] story that's right I told him not in
[48:33] Sunday school this morning
[48:35] Satan read these before we did
[48:40] he was here Harrison
[48:46] to take all of my brain sorry brother
[48:54] all of my brain get the point
[48:57] forget about me
[49:00] if I could take all of my brains that
[49:02] wrote this I said I actually remember
[49:04] remember God's mind is real amen more
[49:06] real like brother now said this morning
[49:08] so this right here is more real than the
[49:10] pages that I'm looking at right here
[49:12] right man but if I'm some way took this
[49:15] because I wrote it
[49:19] I wrote this book
[49:22] books book right here
[49:24] now if any of you read this book it
[49:26] would just be well okay that's good
[49:28] story and that's what it's been down
[49:30] Through the Ages right amen
[49:33] but if I was to some way take my brain
[49:35] out that wrote this and put it into his
[49:38] brain and throw his away
[49:41] then when he opened this book
[49:45] he'd say man I wrote that right exactly
[49:50] people that's a mind of Christ all right
[49:54] that's what we gotta believe that we
[49:55] have now sure we got a car on mine
[49:58] that's right but if we got one little
[50:00] speck of the mind of Christ just what I
[50:02] read you even the Deep things of God can
[50:04] be understood because it's wrote in this
[50:06] book and if that author comes to you and
[50:10] becomes a part of you
[50:12] Gloria not just comes to see you every
[50:14] once in a while that's right but advised
[50:17] amen Satan abides with this morning the
[50:20] Lord does sometimes you know
[50:22] you know why I calls me lady oh
[50:24] bless you
[50:26] but if we have the mind of Christ we
[50:28] should be able to understand what is
[50:31] going on for the day and the hour that
[50:33] we're living in that's right man that's
[50:35] why he puts you here
[50:37] in this age to understand what he wrote
[50:41] because we're not just
[50:44] one page of this book
[50:47] over in Revelations he told John to not
[50:50] just eat one chapter right right he told
[50:53] John to eat the whole book and when you
[50:56] eat the book it becomes a part of you
[50:58] and then you can what digest the things
[51:01] out of here see a lot down Through the
[51:03] Ages they couldn't do that because they
[51:05] surely they had the mind of Christ but
[51:07] it's like I was telling this morning
[51:09] I'm gonna stay out here a little while
[51:11] it's hot up there
[51:13] it's cooler around here but I was
[51:16] telling them this morning even back in
[51:18] the Roman Catholic time in the in the
[51:19] Dark Ages what happened was Constantine
[51:22] looked and he saw a group of religious
[51:25] people
[51:27] that had power not in money and not in
[51:30] government they had power
[51:32] in a church
[51:35] they had power because what
[51:37] people is a church right yeah that's
[51:39] right without this message without
[51:41] people sitting here today
[51:44] I'd just be talking to the wall right so
[51:46] the people made the message so he saw
[51:47] these people
[51:49] and he saw this great powerful Roman
[51:51] government
[51:53] yeah he said if I get these two together
[51:58] so what did he do he took the pull the
[52:00] religious people in pull the political
[52:02] people in instead of now a Roman Empire
[52:04] you've got a Holy Roman Empire
[52:08] all right now what has become it was
[52:11] dirty now's become holy in their eyes
[52:15] and we know what it was Satan doing the
[52:18] work but he was gathering this to this I
[52:21] said well now if the if the devil can do
[52:24] that
[52:24] he's an imitator of God correct right
[52:28] right so God must have done it first
[52:29] amen so he's got the spirit over here
[52:33] and he's got the word over here
[52:35] he said if I ever get these two together
[52:37] in a group of people
[52:42] it'll be a powerful Army and that's our
[52:45] problem a lot of times we got a lot of
[52:47] we got a lot of spirit sometimes and not
[52:48] enough word that's right didn't brother
[52:51] Brown say that about the Pentecostal
[52:52] exactly he said you Pentecostals have
[52:54] got your spirit but you don't know what
[52:56] to do with it you put you
[52:57] fundamentalists you've got what to do
[52:58] with it but you don't have the spirit he
[53:00] said if I ever get you two together
[53:02] powerful army man well now he's talking
[53:05] about Pentecostal people I'm talking
[53:06] about today today
[53:10] get to Spirit in the word we got
[53:11] mechanics and Dynamics it's okay to say
[53:14] well we got mechanics and it's okay to
[53:15] say we got Dynamics but don't keep them
[53:17] apart yes
[53:20] troop City will put it together
[53:22] true seed
[53:24] not true as in false I'm talking about
[53:27] listen brother Brown said we talked
[53:28] about this what sparked this whole thing
[53:31] of the true sea
[53:32] will come with group
[53:35] C before somebody
[53:39] we got a real
[53:42] you there's a difference in being
[53:44] arrogant and confident
[53:46] being arrogant is of the devil being
[53:50] confident I believe God likes people
[53:51] being confident because Paul was very
[53:54] positive he said you'll be judged in my
[53:56] mind gospel some of you think I say
[53:58] things up here or say things outside
[53:59] that you wouldn't want to deal with
[54:01] sister Gail said she was she didn't uh
[54:04] she didn't want to say it because she
[54:05] don't mind she said I don't want I you
[54:07] wouldn't be my I don't want you to be my
[54:09] judge
[54:10] and you know what I thought I said well
[54:11] if God says it from this pulpit
[54:13] history don't matter it will be your
[54:15] judge
[54:18] regardless
[54:20] because where's your judgment gonna
[54:22] start
[54:23] right
[54:25] yeah that's what it starts right here
[54:29] judgment starts here and yet we might
[54:31] get into ourself a little bit too much
[54:34] my grandbaby's been up here
[54:36] where's Deanna
[54:38] oh she's asleep okay
[54:42] you love the Lord
[54:44] all right now let's turn to Romans 8.
[54:46] but listen
[54:47] bro you're going to pull the quote up
[54:49] number one please
[54:51] but you can understand this book but
[54:53] you've got to have the mind of the
[54:55] writer
[54:56] to really know where you come from
[54:59] because see if you were the author if
[55:01] you have part of you and the author
[55:04] have balkanized
[55:06] brother brand amuse vulcanized one time
[55:10] that's your perfect man
[55:12] vulcanized when you taking Heat this up
[55:15] now you can't heat rubber and plastic
[55:19] so you gotta have the right material
[55:21] right
[55:23] right but when you put the two together
[55:24] and melt them together guess what we got
[55:26] recycled things you know recycle bottles
[55:29] that come from probably 100 different
[55:31] bottles
[55:32] but you can't tell the difference
[55:33] because it's been melted down that's
[55:36] right that's right and it's been put
[55:37] together all right so now we're going to
[55:39] read a couple of quotes here now in our
[55:41] journey this is what I want you to
[55:42] remember we may be a little lengthy
[55:44] today in our journey we have two things
[55:47] that you and I have to deal with I'm
[55:49] gonna keep you busy today
[55:51] two things we got to deal with two
[55:54] things we got to deal with
[55:56] it you've got a journey of being a
[55:58] Christian
[56:00] right right just the 565 filled with the
[56:03] Holy Ghost
[56:04] that was Through the Ages amen amen all
[56:06] right now we're called to something a
[56:09] little bit different right when I say
[56:11] different it don't mean we got to be a
[56:12] different Christian right
[56:14] but we do got to understand something
[56:16] that the other ages have never
[56:19] understood before right that's why that
[56:21] you're gonna hear that you hear quotes
[56:24] that seem like brother Brown was talking
[56:25] about this seeing he says you I read it
[56:28] to the to the church out in Oklahoma
[56:31] are ready to quote brother Brian so your
[56:32] eternal life begins right here at the
[56:34] altar
[56:36] IO and I read on the quote out of the
[56:38] same book
[56:40] brother Brown was carrying the thought
[56:41] on over a little bit further he said
[56:44] your eternal life
[56:46] was before the foundation of the world
[56:48] right you never was born on any certain
[56:50] day right
[56:52] now get this is very simple
[56:55] brother Brandon was looking and talking
[56:58] to a group of people
[57:00] it needed salvation amen
[57:03] but now when he turns and looks through
[57:05] God's eyes and you're already born again
[57:09] he can say that you never was that's
[57:11] right Martin only ain't certain nothing
[57:13] man exactly if
[57:16] you have eternal life that eternal life
[57:18] never happened in your hand but you had
[57:21] to come to a place to receive it so
[57:22] brother Branham didn't quit altar called
[57:25] right that's right a lot of all these
[57:28] people say well you always was eternal
[57:29] and all this stuff Wayne brother Ram
[57:31] just quick I have an altar call
[57:37] why he believed in one thing we're human
[57:40] on this side right and we need to stay
[57:43] here but the savior is over here saying
[57:45] hey if you've got me and you
[57:48] you never started on any certain day you
[57:51] never be gone on any certain date you
[57:52] always why is he turned right there
[57:54] right right man correct so now we can
[57:58] take quotes and see that brother Brandon
[58:00] was preaching to humanity
[58:03] but then every once in a while brother
[58:04] then God would drop down and say he'd
[58:07] speak right straight to the bride amen
[58:09] you always was eternal you never was
[58:11] born on any certain day
[58:13] right
[58:17] did you hear what I said yes God you
[58:19] know right
[58:21] spoke to you
[58:22] through that man right he was trying to
[58:26] connect to you and tell you hey if
[58:27] you've got me inside of you
[58:30] this is what's gonna happen but if you
[58:33] don't this is what's going to happen you
[58:35] need me that's right and there you
[58:38] responded to the word all right let's
[58:39] read this quote
[58:42] because you're gonna get started in your
[58:43] journey you have two parts number one
[58:45] you're born again right
[58:46] right number two you have a call in this
[58:49] age for a body change right right no
[58:52] other agent had that call that's right
[58:54] exactly all right so you can be born
[58:56] again listen to me real close you can be
[58:58] born again
[59:00] but if you don't come up to that next
[59:02] level you're going to die and go by the
[59:05] grave you are going not going to make
[59:06] the change alive
[59:09] so I said it's going to be hard
[59:12] just again that's why I can say it down
[59:14] in Sunday school class if you're still
[59:16] smoking and drinking
[59:18] you might not I don't mean you're going
[59:20] to go to hell
[59:22] because you're sure not gonna make a
[59:23] body change right that's right
[59:26] I mean downstairs we're talking about
[59:28] the seals right
[59:30] a whole lot different than just talking
[59:31] about justification certification of
[59:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:34] a quote where the man that that was
[59:37] going to go drink the beer and God took
[59:38] the shirt but he took his servant home
[59:40] that servant didn't get a body change
[59:41] right right remember the preacher said I
[59:44] quit right right
[59:47] brother Brown said God took his serve at
[59:49] home you know what that's what's
[59:50] happening now God's going to take me and
[59:52] you home if we don't quit acting up
[59:54] right right
[59:57] he's gonna take me and you home right
[1:00:00] if we don't quit acting up exactly
[1:00:03] be born again for 50 years
[1:00:07] keep acting up we're going to go by the
[1:00:09] grave exactly
[1:00:11] so it's not the person that comes to be
[1:00:13] destinated eternally from God but to see
[1:00:15] it on the word now
[1:00:19] way back there way too far back for the
[1:00:22] human mind to grasp the Eternal god with
[1:00:23] eternal thoughts thought and decreed
[1:00:25] Jacob have I love
[1:00:27] East all have I hated
[1:00:29] so it's not you
[1:00:31] this precious little thing that we walk
[1:00:33] around in yeah
[1:00:36] but God thought so much of it that when
[1:00:37] he connected with you see
[1:00:40] see when he connected with you
[1:00:42] he's never going to depart that's right
[1:00:44] so if an eternal God had Eternal
[1:00:46] thoughts and he went wrong to start with
[1:00:48] if he's connected to you
[1:00:52] that'll take us in a Rapture amen
[1:00:54] that'll take us in a rapture
[1:00:57] before Anita was born
[1:00:59] nor do you have done good or evil let's
[1:01:01] go and go to the next quote saves time
[1:01:03] brother Joe number two
[1:01:06] now
[1:01:09] I'm going to read these
[1:01:12] now this word true he's talking about
[1:01:14] faithful and true witness now this word
[1:01:16] true is the same word we saw back there
[1:01:17] in Revelation 3 7
[1:01:20] you recall listen to this you recall
[1:01:22] that it does not mean true as in
[1:01:24] contrast with false right it has a
[1:01:27] richer
[1:01:28] look over there a richer deeper meaning
[1:01:32] by far
[1:01:34] amen it expresses perfect realization in
[1:01:38] contrast to partial ain't that what we
[1:01:40] were just talking about harsher
[1:01:41] realization is you're a born-again
[1:01:43] Christian today
[1:01:46] the call for this age is the body change
[1:01:48] not just to stay a born-again Christian
[1:01:51] God had that through seven Church ages
[1:01:56] and that's not what the call of this age
[1:01:58] is right
[1:01:59] right listen
[1:02:01] now back in the Philadelphian they used
[1:02:03] to come into the Lord was drawing now
[1:02:04] what great love that age manifested for
[1:02:06] him then it reminds me he reads let's
[1:02:08] read with them we Rejoice also we
[1:02:10] haven't seen him but we have felt him we
[1:02:12] know him now as much as our limiting
[1:02:14] limiting senses can let us
[1:02:17] listen to what he's saying
[1:02:19] but one day it will be face to face
[1:02:21] that's right
[1:02:22] that's right that is for this
[1:02:25] age
[1:02:27] what's more of an impact when you read
[1:02:29] it on there isn't it
[1:02:30] it's for this age
[1:02:33] he is coming at the end of this age
[1:02:36] partial realization will be made
[1:02:39] perfect realization completed
[1:02:41] realization Hallelujah we have been
[1:02:44] looking through a glass Darkly but soon
[1:02:45] it will be face to face
[1:02:47] we have been going from glory to glory
[1:02:51] I say we've been going around the
[1:02:52] mountain for 40 years
[1:02:55] but soon it will be right in the glory
[1:02:57] and in his glory we'll shine we shall be
[1:02:59] this is not in the Millennium right
[1:03:03] right exactly right this is not in the
[1:03:05] Millennium this is now if we don't
[1:03:08] become that now there won't be a
[1:03:10] millennium
[1:03:11] all right
[1:03:16] we'll shine we shall be like him
[1:03:18] wondrously like in Jesus our savior
[1:03:20] Divine isn't that wonderful we are
[1:03:22] completing him that is true he would not
[1:03:24] lie to us about it but one day we will
[1:03:27] be changing the atoms we will put on any
[1:03:28] more talenting right we will be all
[1:03:30] swallowing up in life than we will
[1:03:32] realize
[1:03:33] realization all right pull up number
[1:03:34] three brother joke please
[1:03:36] this is from the Greek Mexican this is
[1:03:38] where it says a faithful and true
[1:03:39] Witness
[1:03:40] in Revelations 3 14.
[1:03:44] the word true means that which has not
[1:03:47] only the night you read it don't worry
[1:03:49] about this down here some of this stuff
[1:03:51] don't have to we don't have to put on
[1:03:53] there that which is not only the name
[1:03:55] and resemblance
[1:04:00] got it what are you and I
[1:04:03] a continuation of that creation all
[1:04:05] right all right
[1:04:06] but the real nature corresponding to the
[1:04:10] name
[1:04:11] you're fixing to find that out in a
[1:04:12] little while
[1:04:13] in every respect corresponding to the
[1:04:16] idea signified by the name real true
[1:04:20] genuine amen
[1:04:22] that's the faithful and true witness now
[1:04:24] when we talk about true seed we're not
[1:04:27] casting away other seed right but we're
[1:04:29] talking about true seed the one that not
[1:04:32] only has the name but the resemblance
[1:04:34] the real nature corresponding to the
[1:04:37] name
[1:04:39] we're bride right that's right we're
[1:04:41] proud in the last church I used to take
[1:04:43] a Rapture that's what we're identified
[1:04:45] with all right
[1:04:48] everybody say Amen isn't that right now
[1:04:52] put out number four this is way Dale
[1:04:53] quote
[1:05:00] now what has Brothers been talking about
[1:05:01] and then we're gonna I want everybody to
[1:05:03] turn to Romans 8.
[1:05:05] what are we been talking about now here
[1:05:07] this is what came to me the other day
[1:05:09] when we I was sitting up here kind of
[1:05:10] meditating on what I was going to preach
[1:05:11] in Oklahoma
[1:05:13] but the part of the word you heard and
[1:05:15] responded to was the part or the
[1:05:17] attribute of God set aside for you
[1:05:18] before the world Amen
[1:05:21] you want me to decide for that for you
[1:05:23] you had the hero sermon
[1:05:27] those of you that are born again you
[1:05:29] know what I'm talking about you heard a
[1:05:31] sermon and something in that sermon
[1:05:33] sparked
[1:05:35] are just something clicked right what
[1:05:38] was it a sermon about though uh horses
[1:05:40] and cattle no it was a sermon that a
[1:05:43] preacher brought from what
[1:05:45] amen the word amen everybody has their
[1:05:48] favorite scriptures you know what mine
[1:05:50] is it's posted up there because that's
[1:05:52] where I come from
[1:05:54] but you heard
[1:05:56] and that part of the word that you heard
[1:05:58] and responded to remember in Acts there
[1:06:00] was not the Holy Ghost didn't fall on
[1:06:02] any person until after or during the
[1:06:05] word being preached amen right
[1:06:07] so what were they responding to the 3000
[1:06:11] responded to Peter standing up and
[1:06:13] saying hey you killed this guy
[1:06:17] called Jesus
[1:06:19] and what did they say man brother what
[1:06:21] must we do to be safe what was he doing
[1:06:23] he was preaching them the gospel right
[1:06:25] that's right right out of the word of
[1:06:27] God because it's in the word of God
[1:06:28] right
[1:06:29] so the part of the word you heard and
[1:06:31] responded to
[1:06:33] him
[1:06:34] was that attribute
[1:06:36] that God had in his mind
[1:06:39] for you right waiting on you all right
[1:06:42] but if it's Eternal it was with him
[1:06:43] before the foundation Lord amen right
[1:06:46] pretty good quote that's right that's
[1:06:48] Genesis 1 26-27
[1:06:51] and here's what happened
[1:06:53] when we were in the Garden of Eden sorry
[1:06:56] when I say we
[1:06:58] I'm looking at the Garden of Eden
[1:07:00] okay sorry but but when when the Garden
[1:07:03] of Eden when we were there I was
[1:07:05] thinking about that this morning it's
[1:07:06] just kind of funny
[1:07:10] but the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:07:13] but ideally Adam wants to bring forth
[1:07:16] all the thoughts of God right
[1:07:20] so when Adam and Eve did what they did
[1:07:22] God had to curse the ground he didn't
[1:07:24] curse out of me cursed the ground and he
[1:07:26] said hold that thought
[1:07:28] right
[1:07:29] he should hold that thought
[1:07:31] of course the thoughts couldn't come
[1:07:33] at that time exactly right you know we
[1:07:36] always say hold that thought
[1:07:38] well that's what God did he said hold
[1:07:39] that thought
[1:07:41] I got to come and do it myself right now
[1:07:43] all right but what was it the thought of
[1:07:45] me and you it wasn't thought of anything
[1:07:48] of cars and General Motors and this and
[1:07:50] that and this no it was of me and you
[1:07:53] because if it stops are Eternal and he
[1:07:56] can't have a new one or change his talk
[1:07:58] then his first thought about us back in
[1:08:01] Genesis 1 has not ever changed
[1:08:06] so he had the word waiting on you
[1:08:11] because the word's Eternal right right
[1:08:12] right it responded to the part of the
[1:08:15] attribute of God because what is the
[1:08:17] attribute of God
[1:08:18] this Bible is the activation of God Amen
[1:08:20] right it tells everything about God
[1:08:22] there's not a hidden chapter somewhere
[1:08:24] that people don't know this is the word
[1:08:26] of God the mind of God transferred down
[1:08:29] all right but it was set aside for you
[1:08:32] when he set aside Genesis 1 26 and 27 he
[1:08:35] didn't set aside Dean Gibby
[1:08:37] no
[1:08:43] he said this guy's going to respond to
[1:08:46] that scripture right right and when he
[1:08:49] responds to that scripture
[1:08:53] it becomes eternal
[1:08:56] amen he becomes Eternal that's right the
[1:08:59] word always was right now he's become
[1:09:02] eternity
[1:09:03] amen Lord
[1:09:06] pretty good
[1:09:09] but two parts we got to deal with
[1:09:11] we don't kick people out you can cut
[1:09:14] that off Joe thank you bro
[1:09:17] let me tell you something
[1:09:19] we got to kick this thing up a little
[1:09:20] higher right we got to get this gear
[1:09:23] going just a little bit further than
[1:09:24] we're going now
[1:09:25] because we're just going like this
[1:09:27] we're chasing our Tail as the old saying
[1:09:29] goes the dog chases tail it doesn't get
[1:09:31] anywhere right right and actually he
[1:09:33] never catches his title right so we're
[1:09:36] just running around and around in
[1:09:37] circles we got to realize that there's
[1:09:39] something here that is higher
[1:09:42] than any time on the face of the Earth
[1:09:44] right right amen it's the same word of
[1:09:47] God it's the same Bible but brother
[1:09:49] Branham as the prophet of God
[1:09:53] you remember he said he said when he uh
[1:09:56] I think it was Gene gold or one of them
[1:09:58] he had a dream remember and he said
[1:09:59] brother Brandon was out on this like
[1:10:01] this little platform this little saucer
[1:10:03] and he started climbing up and he said
[1:10:05] Gene you can't come out here only God
[1:10:06] can bring you out here now
[1:10:09] I just believe this I'm just dumb enough
[1:10:11] to believe it that wasn't just for
[1:10:13] brother Brown
[1:10:15] he didn't say it God's bringing me out
[1:10:18] here and nobody else he said only God
[1:10:20] can bring you to this position
[1:10:22] you as a human man can't do it that's
[1:10:25] right see but everybody puts brother
[1:10:27] random way up here says oh man he's he's
[1:10:29] up here where no if we don't get into
[1:10:31] that
[1:10:33] if we don't get into that we're lost not
[1:10:36] only lost to go in the house see now I
[1:10:38] don't mean losing going to hell but
[1:10:39] we're lost in what we're supposed to
[1:10:42] bring forth amen
[1:10:44] we've lost it somewhere
[1:10:46] so when you hear me talk about this it
[1:10:50] may not mean this but when we're
[1:10:51] downstairs talking about the seals we're
[1:10:53] in a higher form amen
[1:10:56] we're not dealing with babies anymore
[1:10:58] that's right man we got to stop dealing
[1:11:01] with babies I'm not talking about babies
[1:11:02] in Christ
[1:11:04] oh baby
[1:11:07] but I'm talking about all these little
[1:11:10] ideas and feelings and all this stuff
[1:11:11] that we got going around and all right
[1:11:13] you know and missing church and skipping
[1:11:15] this you guys think another day just
[1:11:17] stupid man
[1:11:19] if you miss Wednesday night service you
[1:11:21] missed 52 Services a year
[1:11:24] away
[1:11:27] service on Wednesday night you miss 52
[1:11:30] sermons right
[1:11:32] right if you only come one time on
[1:11:34] Sunday
[1:11:39] that's a 104 sermons
[1:11:44] and how are we going to take our body
[1:11:45] change
[1:11:46] doing that we cannot
[1:11:49] and folks it's not work
[1:11:52] you sit right here and die in a few amen
[1:11:54] and come every Circle if you come every
[1:11:57] service expecting to meet God and not
[1:12:00] somebody sitting beside you
[1:12:03] he'll give you what you expect
[1:12:06] but think about that you ever thought
[1:12:08] about that if you miss winning tonight's
[1:12:09] service you missed 52 Services a year
[1:12:11] you know brother random as a quote and I
[1:12:13] didn't bring him but brother Brown said
[1:12:14] you know what said the one time you
[1:12:15] missed
[1:12:16] see God may want to bring you something
[1:12:19] right that's it now I'll paraphrase it
[1:12:21] he may want to bring you something that
[1:12:22] service and you miss it right and you
[1:12:25] don't have to give an account for it
[1:12:28] I say you're going to give an account
[1:12:30] for it because you admit because you
[1:12:31] missed it God didn't miss it right right
[1:12:34] these two people always here in church
[1:12:36] God and the devil
[1:12:44] Romans 8.
[1:12:46] you love the Lord
[1:12:53] but everybody got this settled in their
[1:12:55] mind I mean we read all the quotes it's
[1:12:56] not the person that comes predestinated
[1:12:58] eternally but the seed of the word all
[1:12:59] right got that
[1:13:02] all right then we got the uh the part
[1:13:04] where that the word when that word comes
[1:13:07] to you like when I told you there when
[1:13:08] that word comes to you and you respond
[1:13:10] to that
[1:13:11] then that makes you part of the word
[1:13:12] that's right okay and that was eternal
[1:13:15] God always had that waiting on you ready
[1:13:17] all right and when you responded to that
[1:13:19] though
[1:13:21] when you put a seed in the ground
[1:13:24] and it gets up about this high
[1:13:26] do you go out there and go corn
[1:13:29] oh yeah
[1:13:33] Sister pig you've done that before
[1:13:39] but no really you go okay she's in the
[1:13:42] ground she's playing she's got life
[1:13:45] she's growing
[1:13:47] corn
[1:13:49] take it to the market put in the back of
[1:13:51] your pickup truck
[1:13:52] everybody's saying where I'm going with
[1:13:54] this it's not matured yet but it is a
[1:13:57] grain of corn it is a corn
[1:13:59] seed a product of it it has two little
[1:14:02] shoots but it hasn't come to full
[1:14:04] maturity but it did have life it did
[1:14:07] grow it was put in Good Earth
[1:14:09] Born Again people
[1:14:11] but are we going to stay here are we
[1:14:14] going to pluck that thing up
[1:14:16] and say
[1:14:17] that's it
[1:14:19] no we can't do that
[1:14:22] not in this age right
[1:14:24] we're talking about the fourth age
[1:14:25] downstairs in that fourth age brother
[1:14:27] Brown said it was just enough to be
[1:14:29] called a Christian
[1:14:31] and give your life for the gospel and
[1:14:33] that's all they were required
[1:14:36] exactly Luther's age was required to say
[1:14:39] the just shall live by faith not by
[1:14:43] Penance not by what the Catholic Church
[1:14:44] says they just shall live by faith but
[1:14:48] Luther would go home from the from the
[1:14:50] church and he'd go and get him a beer
[1:14:52] and smoke him a pipe
[1:14:54] we can't do that right why because that
[1:14:58] plant was here
[1:14:59] now that plant's put a stalk on it now
[1:15:02] that plant's put a tassel and now
[1:15:04] there's something on the very end of it
[1:15:06] that was just like the original that was
[1:15:08] planted that's right right right right
[1:15:10] exactly
[1:15:13] remember what brother random says he
[1:15:15] says
[1:15:16] the two shoots
[1:15:19] the life goes out of them yeah
[1:15:22] life goes into stock right life goes out
[1:15:25] of that right exactly life goes into
[1:15:28] but he said the life goes out of those
[1:15:30] right he said there's only life in the
[1:15:33] original seat amen right right carriers
[1:15:36] now that doesn't make them not part of
[1:15:38] the plant that does not make them not
[1:15:40] born again right right everybody
[1:15:41] understand that we're not we're not
[1:15:43] putting excuse me putting people out
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:46] we're trying to draw them in
[1:15:48] Glory we're trying to draw them in we're
[1:15:50] not trying to do away with them
[1:15:52] but you are the one that control how
[1:15:55] high that plant grows amen right right
[1:15:58] and when brother Dale ever gets us down
[1:16:00] to the Earth he's going to explain that
[1:16:01] right
[1:16:03] right that's where the explanation comes
[1:16:06] to where you do have something to do
[1:16:07] with it right
[1:16:09] you can pull that plant up and say I got
[1:16:11] no Let It Grow all right let it grow let
[1:16:15] it grow
[1:16:16] Let It Grow and it will become you know
[1:16:19] what if you let it grow you don't have
[1:16:21] to do the same sister Andy you don't
[1:16:22] have to go out there every day and go
[1:16:24] you're a corn plant
[1:16:27] no it knows it's a corn plant leave it
[1:16:30] alone
[1:16:31] fertilize it a little bit water it right
[1:16:34] right take it to church with you
[1:16:36] sometime
[1:16:39] Romans 8 now we're gonna go through
[1:16:42] right now
[1:16:46] we got number do we do number four yes
[1:16:48] we did okay all right so now Romans 8 I
[1:16:52] know Dad's been through this now let's
[1:16:53] just kind of
[1:16:54] flip through it just real quick
[1:16:56] and uh
[1:16:58] I hope everything I said is okay so far
[1:17:01] that you'll understand that
[1:17:03] we're not trying to say true seed and
[1:17:06] salt seed or we're not trying to say
[1:17:07] fruit seed and we're gonna we're gonna
[1:17:09] no it's not for us to do it's not for us
[1:17:11] to say it's not alone but you do have
[1:17:14] something to do with this that's right
[1:17:16] all right you can say I'm going in a
[1:17:19] rapture
[1:17:21] but these things that we've got to do
[1:17:23] to get us there
[1:17:25] excuse me all right Romans 8.
[1:17:28] now we know that there are three stages
[1:17:30] in this adoption and in your journey
[1:17:32] here's the first stage verse chapter 14
[1:17:35] for as many are led by the spirit of God
[1:17:37] they are the sons of God
[1:17:39] which is what
[1:17:41] Genesis 1 26 and 27 that's where you're
[1:17:44] that's where your new birth begin that
[1:17:47] was where God
[1:17:48] knew you were going to respond to that
[1:17:50] word had that word waiting for you it is
[1:17:53] eternal you you're not the son of Samuel
[1:17:56] and Peggy Dale anymore you're my child
[1:17:59] ciao I said ciao you're my child
[1:18:03] all right let's read this real slow
[1:18:07] for you have not
[1:18:09] responded again to fear
[1:18:12] fear right false evidence appearing real
[1:18:15] yeah yeah don't ever fear anything right
[1:18:18] because Satan's gonna put a scarecrow up
[1:18:21] in front of that crop
[1:18:24] bro you have not received the spirit of
[1:18:26] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:18:27] received the spirit of adoption right in
[1:18:30] other words now you have the ability to
[1:18:33] become adopted right exactly we're not
[1:18:37] going to read the other one but you know
[1:18:38] though you were a son
[1:18:40] you still had tutors and governors but
[1:18:42] you were always a son you got part of
[1:18:45] the inheritance because right here's
[1:18:46] what it tells you right here that even
[1:18:48] in this baby stage
[1:18:51] whereby we cry I have a father now see
[1:18:54] there we cry because we're babies amen
[1:18:58] you see that yes yes
[1:19:01] father father we cry
[1:19:03] you get them down further you don't cry
[1:19:08] we got a checkbook now with Jesus it
[1:19:10] with our daddy's name on it
[1:19:12] he hands it to us and we cash it when we
[1:19:15] get down to the end he's just gonna give
[1:19:16] us a blank check
[1:19:19] we signed the bottom and we go cash it
[1:19:22] right all right now listen but watch we
[1:19:25] got a journey
[1:19:29] you know but you never see the spirit of
[1:19:31] adoption whereby we cry I'm a father
[1:19:34] the spirit itself bearth witness with
[1:19:36] our spirit who now that's Paul
[1:19:39] the spirit capital S right capital S
[1:19:43] that's the holy spirit is agreeing with
[1:19:45] our spirit it's a witness with our
[1:19:48] spirit inside ourselves
[1:19:51] not the flesh guy not the creation right
[1:19:55] not the creation that your mom and daddy
[1:19:57] brought
[1:19:58] because we're going to deal with that in
[1:20:00] just a minute right
[1:20:01] watch how this Authority come the spirit
[1:20:03] itself bear with witness with our spirit
[1:20:05] that we will become the children of God
[1:20:11] all right my glasses are bad oh oh we
[1:20:15] are the children of God
[1:20:17] orange present right
[1:20:21] and I'll quote the rest of it and if
[1:20:23] children
[1:20:25] Ayers
[1:20:27] and Joint heirs with Jesus Christ
[1:20:31] at the baby stage of adoption
[1:20:34] amen because we get what he gets that's
[1:20:37] right
[1:20:38] we get what he gets Laurie air is not
[1:20:41] like this
[1:20:42] air is like this amen but he gets you
[1:20:45] get right equal portions amen hey baby
[1:20:49] adoption that's right
[1:20:51] when you just start your journey amen
[1:20:56] thank you jeez people we live way below
[1:21:00] our privileges right
[1:21:02] and if children then heirs
[1:21:05] Heirs of God and join ours with Christ
[1:21:09] if so be if
[1:21:12] so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:21:15] may be also White
[1:21:19] that's baby stage adoption right
[1:21:22] because those who he is truly Justified
[1:21:25] he's already glorified it says right
[1:21:28] there right that's right amen
[1:21:30] now you may have to die and go by the
[1:21:32] grave and get your glorification right
[1:21:34] right right right right
[1:21:36] it's your choice
[1:21:40] but
[1:21:41] we are in the time that it can happen
[1:21:46] let's just be real honest and I'm going
[1:21:48] to be confident here
[1:21:50] and bold
[1:21:51] Paul couldn't preach this sermon
[1:21:55] boy that hurt
[1:21:58] some of you older brothers
[1:22:00] is that correct right amen Paul could
[1:22:04] not preach this sermon today right
[1:22:08] exactly
[1:22:11] there's no understanding for it now the
[1:22:14] Holy Ghost was there the word of God was
[1:22:17] there but see Paul was writing the word
[1:22:19] prophesying right right that there would
[1:22:21] be a group come to fulfill what he saw
[1:22:26] that's what I and they really enjoyed
[1:22:27] that you know uh telling dad that that
[1:22:30] they they'd never seen that in Oklahoma
[1:22:32] that those who prophesy must die if you
[1:22:34] prophesy something then that means
[1:22:36] you're prophesying something to come
[1:22:37] that's right something to come right
[1:22:39] right if we prophesy it's something to
[1:22:42] come right exactly
[1:22:44] right right so we have to pass on
[1:22:48] so that that can come that's right
[1:22:50] because that is greater right
[1:22:52] than me standing here doing the prophecy
[1:22:56] nobody understand that
[1:22:58] man let me say it one more
[1:23:00] for sure people like me
[1:23:01] I really didn't get that the first time
[1:23:03] anyway I think but really if you stand
[1:23:06] here and you prophesy on something to
[1:23:08] come
[1:23:09] it's greater than you standing right
[1:23:12] here man right right and if you prophesy
[1:23:14] that means you're not going to be there
[1:23:15] because that's got to come right here
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:23] so if we keep prophesying
[1:23:26] what's gonna happen we're gonna die
[1:23:29] right because this right here is greater
[1:23:32] and it's coming Glory really it's not
[1:23:34] coming it's staying there we're meeting
[1:23:35] it right right right everybody got that
[1:23:38] yeah
[1:23:39] so if we prophesy oh there's a great
[1:23:42] bride coming
[1:23:45] you're dead
[1:23:47] we're dead
[1:23:48] right we're dead
[1:23:50] if we say oh there's a great translation
[1:23:52] coming
[1:23:54] oh it's coming no it's here
[1:23:59] in 1963 folks that judge came down
[1:24:04] and he did not leave right amen white
[1:24:07] wig exactly he was a judge
[1:24:10] where do you think that's going to come
[1:24:11] from right the bride that's standing on
[1:24:14] the earth that's right not the bride
[1:24:16] before they can't judge you can't judge
[1:24:17] if you're already dead
[1:24:20] you have to be alive to be a judge when
[1:24:23] 1963 when that judge when that when that
[1:24:25] hood came down that white wig came down
[1:24:27] he came to judge this Earth glory and he
[1:24:31] came to judge this Earth I ain't talking
[1:24:33] about the ball that we stand on I'm
[1:24:36] talking about this sir he come to judge
[1:24:38] this guy right here because when he
[1:24:39] brought the seals this is what he judged
[1:24:42] and you know what he said now I call you
[1:24:44] bro
[1:24:46] you're perfect
[1:24:48] you're complete
[1:24:50] Roman hey
[1:24:54] because all the other ages couldn't come
[1:24:55] to understanding that we come to you
[1:24:57] that's right Paul Peter they were
[1:24:59] prophesying brother Benny the whole
[1:25:02] Bible
[1:25:03] every Prophecy in the Bible speaks to
[1:25:05] you amen amen if you're the Bride of
[1:25:07] Jesus Christ
[1:25:09] that's why I said before remember we
[1:25:11] don't type anything
[1:25:13] right everything types us amen exactly
[1:25:17] you say oh what she is him remember
[1:25:20] she is him so whatever types him types
[1:25:24] us and he's the whole type of the Bible
[1:25:26] Moses didn't we don't type Moses right
[1:25:29] Moses talk to us all right right
[1:25:37] there's only one person that don't type
[1:25:40] us and that's Jesus because he's our
[1:25:42] husband
[1:25:43] we don't he's only one and it's in the
[1:25:46] scripture that that we don't type with
[1:25:49] because he is the great one and we're
[1:25:52] his bride but see everything else he
[1:25:54] balls around that
[1:25:56] when he was on the cross we were on his
[1:25:59] mind we were the ones he came after he
[1:26:02] did not come after the ones that are not
[1:26:03] written in that land Book of Life that's
[1:26:05] right Sherry came to die but everybody
[1:26:07] would but he knew that they wouldn't
[1:26:09] right all right now
[1:26:16] verse 17 and his children then heirs
[1:26:18] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[1:26:20] and so be that we suffer with him that
[1:26:22] we may be also glorified together right
[1:26:26] he's got a marriage in there it's
[1:26:28] together we're glorified together right
[1:26:31] right you know Jesus had to be glorified
[1:26:34] right right man the flesh Jesus had to
[1:26:36] be glorified Glory the flesh right flesh
[1:26:38] had to be glorified yes right so we're
[1:26:42] glorified with him right amen
[1:26:45] we were there with him right right now
[1:26:48] look you can get all carnal and say boy
[1:26:50] I can remember when I was back before
[1:26:52] the foundation world or I can remember
[1:26:54] being on the shores of gallery but can
[1:26:56] why do you think brother Brown
[1:26:58] told so vivid a story
[1:27:02] now him being a prophet I believe God
[1:27:04] could let him see back later
[1:27:06] and literally see Even Adam in the
[1:27:08] garden and be able to describe it down
[1:27:10] to her hair and her eyes and I Adam and
[1:27:13] everything else but why can't you and I
[1:27:15] don't believe
[1:27:17] three want that Prophet said and then
[1:27:19] every once in a while God made sister
[1:27:21] Anna he may blow the clouds back and let
[1:27:24] us see what he's really talking about
[1:27:25] right
[1:27:28] Brother Dean c not not C I understand
[1:27:31] right understand what's going on
[1:27:36] folks this is not a gospel that we just
[1:27:38] sat in here and hold the football and
[1:27:40] sit on the front view and say touchdown
[1:27:42] no you gotta run
[1:27:46] you might get knocked down and
[1:27:47] blindsided every once in a while right
[1:27:49] but you know what get back up all right
[1:27:53] we got the Playbook all right we got the
[1:27:57] Playbook you know I saw a thing the
[1:27:59] other day
[1:28:00] he's going to Baptist Church
[1:28:03] he said God
[1:28:05] gives tests test tsts God gives tests
[1:28:09] but they're all open books
[1:28:13] but they're all open book 10. that's
[1:28:16] good every test he gives us
[1:28:20] everything we need for the test that we
[1:28:22] have is in this book and you know what I
[1:28:24] said see this is where you get in
[1:28:26] trouble
[1:28:27] I said God that book might not be open
[1:28:29] to them but I know you opened it to me
[1:28:31] all right because we're an open book
[1:28:33] group yeah you can read the book like
[1:28:35] this right here like most people do but
[1:28:37] we can see what's going on inside this
[1:28:39] group right so we really do when we have
[1:28:41] a test we do have an open book test we
[1:28:44] ought to shop more than the back to
[1:28:46] shout about it
[1:28:48] Amen to that right
[1:28:52] all right let's finish
[1:28:57] verse 18. now here we go and start into
[1:28:59] the second stage for I reckon that the
[1:29:02] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:29:03] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:29:05] which shall be revealed
[1:29:08] in Jesus
[1:29:10] oh what'd I say
[1:29:12] in US amen
[1:29:14] watch Paul he's bringing the he's
[1:29:16] bringing the children
[1:29:18] heirs John heirs with Christ and then
[1:29:20] what'd he say he said now it's going to
[1:29:21] be revealed and he tells you exactly
[1:29:23] where it's going to be revealed at
[1:29:24] it's gonna be revealed in us right man
[1:29:27] now part of
[1:29:29] everyone to get all over brother Danny
[1:29:30] he got a portion of it he got his
[1:29:32] portion right sure he was the pattern
[1:29:34] messenger one of the greatest prophets
[1:29:35] but like I said before his understanding
[1:29:38] was limited
[1:29:40] by what word he had
[1:29:42] sure
[1:29:43] do you really believe another day you
[1:29:45] ever thought about this do you really
[1:29:47] believe that Paul when he was writing
[1:29:49] those letters to Thessalonians and
[1:29:51] Corinthians do you really believe you
[1:29:52] thought that was going to be putting
[1:29:53] Eternal Word of God I don't know I'm
[1:29:55] just asking a question
[1:29:56] I mean I'm really not just you but I I
[1:29:59] sometimes you're a thinker like me we
[1:30:01] sit down and think about things
[1:30:03] I mean if I'm writing a letter to the
[1:30:04] Thessalonians and I say hey or the
[1:30:06] Corinth he said hey you guys are really
[1:30:07] good for nothing because that's what he
[1:30:08] was saying you know you need to stop
[1:30:09] this you need to quit this you need to
[1:30:11] quit doing this you need to start doing
[1:30:12] this well he was right on the letter
[1:30:14] right
[1:30:17] remember there was no Bible until about
[1:30:20] the 1500s right or 1800s there was no
[1:30:22] Bible what we consider a Bible there
[1:30:25] were Scrolls over here they were
[1:30:26] scrolled over here they were scrolled
[1:30:27] over here but somebody brought
[1:30:29] together amen
[1:30:32] and God said put that one right there
[1:30:34] put that one right there because this is
[1:30:36] for all my church not just the first one
[1:30:38] all right put this one right here this
[1:30:41] letter to the Thessalonians to the
[1:30:43] Corinthians to the Ephesians look at the
[1:30:45] Ephesians
[1:30:46] it's a very short book but look how
[1:30:49] powerful it is why because they could
[1:30:52] take strong meat they can understand
[1:30:53] what Paul was talking about right all
[1:30:56] right the Corinthians he kept going back
[1:30:57] and kept going back
[1:30:59] but you know what
[1:31:02] they're in the Eternal Word of God Amen
[1:31:04] so they might have messed up but you
[1:31:06] know what God gets forgiveness but you
[1:31:08] know what they didn't take a body change
[1:31:09] that's right but the junk that they were
[1:31:12] doing and you and I are not gonna take a
[1:31:13] body change with the junk that we're
[1:31:14] doing right yeah we need to get rid of
[1:31:16] but look
[1:31:17] she'll get be compared with the glory
[1:31:18] which shall be revealed in US
[1:31:21] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:31:24] creature or creation weighteth for the
[1:31:27] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:31:30] are the what the making known
[1:31:34] that we're here yeah
[1:31:38] yeah people were here not that we're
[1:31:41] coming right we have arrived
[1:31:44] that part of that scripture of authority
[1:31:47] is on the scene right somebody is alive
[1:31:50] and going to say this body will not die

[1:32:12] other

[1:32:17] I'll be oh like y'all are all now but
[1:32:22] um
[1:32:23] but you know think about it though
[1:32:25] somebody is on the scene that's the way
[1:32:27] I read the scripture now I told you but
[1:32:29] there's a fire in my bones
[1:32:31] you read that scripture don't read that
[1:32:32] scripture for somebody else read that
[1:32:35] scripture for yourself

[1:32:44] to do the work right
[1:32:46] word's been here remember it's eternal
[1:32:50] right it was already fourth Foundation
[1:32:51] to work right now
[1:32:53] but we've arrived we've come to the
[1:32:55] place where you can look at you cannot
[1:32:56] look at me but you can look at the word
[1:32:58] of God and say
[1:32:59] that ain't nothing but the truth now
[1:33:01] what did that bring sister had to write
[1:33:03] it brought her the spoken word exactly
[1:33:05] it brought her her two sons right
[1:33:08] in other words he said whatever you say
[1:33:13] you know I asked for 10 billion
[1:33:15] dollars God would have had to give it to
[1:33:17] her exactly but he knew what she would
[1:33:19] want
[1:33:21] that's why I could say that amen he knew
[1:33:25] what she wanted
[1:33:26] and when he knew what she wanted
[1:33:29] it was already there waiting on her
[1:33:31] whatever you need
[1:33:33] that's not what I said it's waiting on
[1:33:36] you all right to realize it's already
[1:33:38] here that's right remember he does it
[1:33:41] reveals it
[1:33:43] makes it manifest by the time he's made
[1:33:45] a manifest he's going to work through a
[1:33:46] couple of stages dogs over here doing
[1:33:47] this right
[1:33:49] waiting on me and you to get to that
[1:33:51] stage of manifestation
[1:33:53] does it reveals it makes it manifest
[1:33:55] well that's what we're talking about
[1:33:56] right here manifestation of the sons of
[1:33:59] God all right everybody all right amen
[1:34:02] not going too long I may need to go
[1:34:03] about another 10-15 minutes all right
[1:34:05] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:34:07] creature verse 19 waited for the
[1:34:08] manifestation of the sons of God now
[1:34:11] watch this that's not us waiting
[1:34:16] read that again
[1:34:18] that's not us waiting for the
[1:34:19] manifestation of the sons of God this
[1:34:22] world is waiting
[1:34:24] we're not waiting read that again
[1:34:27] cause our creation waited for the
[1:34:31] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:34:33] I've always then when the fall happened
[1:34:35] before the fall Adam and Eve were in the
[1:34:38] Garden of Eden
[1:34:41] and the Lions and the Tigers just played
[1:34:44] around them yeah they scratch your back
[1:34:47] scratch your belly just like a bunch of
[1:34:49] little kittens because they didn't eat
[1:34:50] each other yeah
[1:34:52] yeah but after that fall happened
[1:34:55] oh what a place Adam was in
[1:34:58] where he could walk through the garden
[1:34:59] and just move stuff then he couldn't do
[1:35:01] that anymore
[1:35:03] and then the lion instead of looking at
[1:35:04] him as a as a friend he looked at him as
[1:35:07] food that's right
[1:35:09] and then Adam started watching
[1:35:11] the big cats eat the little calves
[1:35:15] and the other cats eating the smaller
[1:35:16] cats
[1:35:17] you know the chain down through the
[1:35:20] chain don't you think that really hurt
[1:35:22] Adam yes well you know what
[1:35:24] that line didn't want to do that right
[1:35:27] that tiger doesn't want to do that
[1:35:30] that elephant doesn't want to do that
[1:35:31] all those animals don't want to do that
[1:35:33] you know what they're doing they're
[1:35:35] looking at Adam
[1:35:39] and go and hurry up yeah we don't want
[1:35:42] to do this this is not in the original
[1:35:44] exactly this is not the way I'm supposed
[1:35:47] to be that's right I'm not supposed to
[1:35:49] eat meat
[1:35:52] so the whole world growing it and waited
[1:35:55] and travail we're going to read
[1:35:58] together with us
[1:36:03] so they're waiting on us
[1:36:05] once we start manifesting what
[1:36:08] was lost
[1:36:09] remember that's Redemption
[1:36:12] bringing back what was originally here
[1:36:16] come back to that sure we saw it a few
[1:36:18] times with brother Branham with the
[1:36:20] storm and and that's what a preacher
[1:36:23] really did a good job one time you know
[1:36:24] because remember when brother Brown
[1:36:25] spoke the storm out of existence
[1:36:27] remember the two dogs the two does
[1:36:29] walked right up to brother Brown he said
[1:36:31] they shouldn't have done that right do
[1:36:32] you know what they were doing they were
[1:36:33] going
[1:36:35] Adam
[1:36:36] is that you Adam if you made it back
[1:36:40] you're not gonna shoot me good
[1:36:45] isn't that right right that's what those
[1:36:47] deer were doing nature
[1:36:49] so let's Master amen that's right for
[1:36:52] just a moment now he saw they saw Adam
[1:36:54] back in full view move this move this
[1:36:57] don't do this do this don't do that
[1:37:01] now listen
[1:37:02] you and I are never going to come to the
[1:37:04] place where we need to move trees I
[1:37:06] don't think
[1:37:08] or we don't need to do everything that
[1:37:10] Adam did but let me tell you something
[1:37:12] this whole world has grown in to come
[1:37:13] back into that condition
[1:37:15] the way that we are not their ruler
[1:37:20] because if you rule by this
[1:37:23] it's wrong that's right if you're real
[1:37:25] by this it's right I'm talking about the
[1:37:27] spirit you ruled by this it's wrong this
[1:37:30] is what got us all in trouble we're real
[1:37:32] about this
[1:37:33] kingdoms Kings
[1:37:35] we're supposed to be Kings and Priests
[1:37:37] but not act like some Kings and Priests
[1:37:39] that I know right why because we're
[1:37:42] ruled by the inside
[1:37:52] guy well when's it ever going to happen
[1:37:55] when's it gonna happen that's right
[1:37:58] if it's there
[1:38:00] you're the one that's keeping it from
[1:38:02] happening
[1:38:05] I said if it's now that's right
[1:38:10] we're going to show our colors because
[1:38:11] this is going to show
[1:38:13] who's got it and who don't know man
[1:38:16] okay let's finish
[1:38:18] because the creature let's go back to
[1:38:20] 20. for the create for the creature
[1:38:22] which makes subject to vanity not
[1:38:24] willingly but by a reason of him who has
[1:38:26] subjected the same in hope in other
[1:38:28] words they weren't willingly the the
[1:38:30] natural world didn't willingly fall
[1:38:34] the natural world was cursed by what
[1:38:37] Adam and Eve did so they didn't do it
[1:38:39] willingly right right right so they
[1:38:42] didn't do it so it's not their fault
[1:38:43] that's right it's our fault and when we
[1:38:46] started understanding that when we get
[1:38:48] this thing stand back up right
[1:38:50] because remember we resurrected right
[1:38:54] sitting in Heavenly places wasn't
[1:38:55] resurrected me and that means you came
[1:38:57] up that's right you were once down in
[1:38:59] the earth now you've come up out of the
[1:39:01] Earth
[1:39:02] all right so now listen we're getting
[1:39:04] close to getting that checkbook with a
[1:39:06] name on it for the creature was made 70
[1:39:07] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:39:10] him last subjected the same in Hope
[1:39:12] because the creature itself also shall
[1:39:15] be delivered also
[1:39:18] so we're gonna be delivered from
[1:39:19] something and they're also going to be
[1:39:21] delivered right all right from the
[1:39:24] bondage of corruption
[1:39:26] this guy
[1:39:28] sure this is correct remember corruption
[1:39:30] must become Incorruptible
[1:39:32] when the bondage of corruption into the
[1:39:34] Glorious Liberty
[1:39:37] Liberty
[1:39:39] freedom
[1:39:40] we're bound now
[1:39:44] you can say you were
[1:39:46] you're bound by this
[1:39:49] but when are we going to start believing
[1:39:50] that
[1:39:51] what's inside of us is more real than
[1:39:53] this yeah I hope you caught that exactly
[1:39:56] that's right because your soul Came From
[1:39:58] Another Dimension that's right I mean
[1:40:00] the soul of God Came From Another
[1:40:01] Dimension even your soul came from
[1:40:03] another Dimensions but the soul of God
[1:40:05] Came From Another Dimension
[1:40:08] so what's more real right can you and I
[1:40:11] go to a dimension can I go walk in that
[1:40:12] wall no no you know why I can't walk to
[1:40:14] that wall number one because I don't
[1:40:16] believe it let's be truthful
[1:40:19] but if I drop dead right here you
[1:40:21] wouldn't have to open the door to let me
[1:40:22] out that's right that's right right
[1:40:24] that's right amen so watch more watch
[1:40:26] more Supernatural right this
[1:40:30] or this one you can't see all right this
[1:40:33] one right here is more real inside so
[1:40:35] now
[1:40:36] when we start getting our stinking
[1:40:38] thinking like the brother preached the
[1:40:39] other day when we start getting our
[1:40:40] stinking thinking away from well we're
[1:40:42] trapped in this whole body and there's
[1:40:44] nothing we can do about it and this is
[1:40:46] just something more pastels that we got
[1:40:47] to deal with
[1:40:48] no
[1:40:50] this has got to go with us right because
[1:40:53] that's what we came here to Earth to do
[1:40:55] is to pick up our natural body
[1:40:57] because God was going to live listen to
[1:41:00] me God was going to live in flesh in a
[1:41:02] human body for eternity that was his
[1:41:05] plan I didn't say was I meant it is his
[1:41:09] plan right
[1:41:10] he just had to hold his thoughts there
[1:41:12] for a little while you and I had to hold
[1:41:14] us then as we came to the Earth through
[1:41:17] this through the bedding ground
[1:41:19] we came one by one
[1:41:26] but now he calls for full manifestation
[1:41:29] of that person
[1:41:31] right not that person
[1:41:34] that person was born from Mr Miss Kylie
[1:41:38] this person
[1:41:41] and he's going to deal with that right
[1:41:43] right
[1:41:44] but God gave us a way to deal with it
[1:41:46] amen
[1:41:47] he didn't leave this thing hopeless
[1:41:50] he didn't leave this thing where we
[1:41:53] couldn't do it that's right there just
[1:41:54] was never enough word
[1:41:56] for us to absorb
[1:42:00] right right
[1:42:02] that's right because they were true seed
[1:42:04] down through the end time through the
[1:42:05] through the seven churches it was true
[1:42:06] see
[1:42:09] quickened by the word of God and let's
[1:42:11] just be honest with each other
[1:42:13] has anybody ever been healed in your
[1:42:15] shadow
[1:42:18] was in Peter's Day
[1:42:21] we're supposed to have a greater than
[1:42:22] Solomon here right right uh if you ever
[1:42:26] walk by and said Silver and Gold Have My
[1:42:27] none yeah we've all done that come on
[1:42:29] people
[1:42:31] you lay hands on
[1:42:33] and they get healed sure it's not what
[1:42:36] you did but it was a connection
[1:42:38] silver and gold how about none amen but
[1:42:41] such as I have
[1:42:42] you gotta have it to get it right you
[1:42:45] gotta have it to give it that's the key
[1:42:46] if nothing happens maybe you ain't got
[1:42:48] it right let's just be honest with each
[1:42:50] other
[1:42:52] if you ain't got it there's nothing
[1:42:53] there to get
[1:42:55] one brother randomly always said his
[1:42:56] mother said you can't get blood out of
[1:42:57] the tournament because there's no
[1:42:58] personal no blood in return
[1:43:00] all right
[1:43:01] verse 21 let's finish because the
[1:43:03] creature
[1:43:05] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:43:07] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[1:43:09] Liberty of the children of God look what
[1:43:11] he's done for we know that the whole
[1:43:12] creation groaneth and travaleth in pain
[1:43:16] together
[1:43:18] two very important words
[1:43:20] until now right
[1:43:23] that that's where I stopped until now
[1:43:25] right
[1:43:27] because I never really understood I
[1:43:29] thought that third stage was the change
[1:43:31] of the body
[1:43:32] we know better than that now right
[1:43:34] but watch how God is bringing us through
[1:43:36] the authority stage and right before he
[1:43:39] starts talking about
[1:43:42] the adoption to with the Redemption the
[1:43:44] body he says we've grown and Prevail
[1:43:47] until now in other words we've grown and
[1:43:50] prevailed until
[1:43:54] August the 21st yeah
[1:43:56] 2011. we've grown within ourselves amen
[1:44:01] wondering
[1:44:02] what is this change of the body
[1:44:04] what is this adoption what is all this
[1:44:08] crazy stuff that some of you that are
[1:44:09] new here that that that may not
[1:44:11] understand
[1:44:13] don't look around Rick I'm calling you
[1:44:16] um
[1:44:21] but all that is going to come to pass in
[1:44:24] somebody
[1:44:26] that's alive
[1:44:28] right so until now we've had a problem
[1:44:32] oh man that's why that's what Paul's
[1:44:34] saying we've groaned and prevailed until
[1:44:38] now right but he was prophesied right he
[1:44:43] didn't see that right
[1:44:45] but you and I are sitting where we can
[1:44:47] literally folks let me tell you
[1:44:49] something
[1:44:50] gold prices are going up through the
[1:44:51] roof who owns the gold of the worm
[1:44:55] Roman Catholic Church they're sitting
[1:44:57] over there getting richer while the
[1:44:59] whole world is getting poorer
[1:45:03] they're sitting up you understand what I
[1:45:05] just said
[1:45:07] the Richard
[1:45:08] day while every country in the world is
[1:45:10] getting poorer and poorer and poorer
[1:45:13] that's right that's Bible prophecy
[1:45:16] coming to pass right before your eyes
[1:45:20] you're sitting in it now it's not a
[1:45:22] prophecy that's right brother it's a
[1:45:24] reality
[1:45:26] and guess what they're gonna do
[1:45:28] they're gonna say Okay United States you
[1:45:30] got the biggest military you're all over
[1:45:32] the world we'll tell what you want to do
[1:45:35] and you enforce it there's your image to
[1:45:39] the beast that's right yeah and we're in
[1:45:40] the Book of Revelation yes standing in
[1:45:43] it not looking for it to come we're
[1:45:46] standing in it right now right now
[1:45:49] so we are now the sons of God right not
[1:45:52] going to be
[1:45:54] and the last part
[1:45:58] but we know that the whole creation
[1:45:59] girls incredible tremendous and pain
[1:46:01] together until now
[1:46:03] and not only they
[1:46:05] but ourselves also which have the first
[1:46:08] fruits of the spirit
[1:46:10] even we ourselves growing within
[1:46:12] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:46:16] wit the Redemption
[1:46:18] of our
[1:46:19] bodies
[1:46:21] to understand
[1:46:24] the Redemption exactly have you ever
[1:46:27] looked at that word let me pull it right
[1:46:28] back over here and let me read it
[1:46:30] because I read it to them and Oklahoma
[1:46:37] I'll find it
[1:46:44] do it
[1:46:45] means how
[1:46:47] about
[1:46:48] and to understand
[1:46:50] or it also means the intellect
[1:46:54] or the understanding right
[1:46:56] to it that's what means Strong's 56 13 I
[1:46:59] think they read it but it's the
[1:47:01] intellect or the understanding he said
[1:47:03] oh intellect
[1:47:07] intellectual person on the face of the
[1:47:09] Earth and let's not forget one thing if
[1:47:11] he came to you and gave you his mind
[1:47:14] he didn't give you a lesser part of him
[1:47:16] that's right right he didn't give you an
[1:47:19] extra part of him he didn't say oh now
[1:47:22] Danny from Banks County I'm just gonna
[1:47:25] give him a little bit
[1:47:27] I'll be laughing the rest of them no
[1:47:29] brother Danny when he gave me the new
[1:47:31] birth you know what he gave you the same
[1:47:32] God Amen he give brother Brown exactly
[1:47:35] the same God that was in Jesus Christ
[1:47:37] the same God that was before the
[1:47:39] foundation of the world all right the
[1:47:41] same God that's not back there anymore
[1:47:43] he's here
[1:47:44] he's here to do the work we need to let
[1:47:47] him do it all right that's the whole
[1:47:49] problem we need to let him do it we need
[1:47:52] to let him do the work let us quit
[1:47:54] trying to figure it out but you know
[1:47:56] what he said we can understand the Deep
[1:47:58] things of God right
[1:48:04] right brother Joe if you want to put up
[1:48:07] possessing the enemy's Gates
[1:48:10] 1958.
[1:48:16] this is the prophet
[1:48:18] but I don't believe that the true Seed
[1:48:21] of Abraham will fail they'll stand just
[1:48:23] as gallant and loyal as Abraham did all
[1:48:27] right
[1:48:28] thank you Lord now we've got the Bible
[1:48:30] and we've got a prophet
[1:48:33] remember David believed what his Prophet
[1:48:35] said so the giant was not involved
[1:48:38] David believed that that the prophet
[1:48:40] Samuel anointed him to be king and it
[1:48:42] really didn't matter what was going to
[1:48:43] happen right he was going to be king
[1:48:45] because he believed this Prophet right
[1:48:47] so if we believe our Prophet guess what
[1:48:49] look what he said
[1:48:51] but when the testing comes that's where
[1:48:54] we fail
[1:48:55] but I don't believe that the true Seed
[1:48:59] of Abraham will fail
[1:49:00] that's right
[1:49:01] are you true sick of Abraham that's your
[1:49:03] choice
[1:49:04] all right spoken words Regional seat 19.
[1:49:08] 62.
[1:49:11] then from a little group of the true
[1:49:13] seed of the word God will present Christ
[1:49:15] The Beloved bride a virgin a virgin
[1:49:18] of his word now I didn't have the rest
[1:49:21] of this but I want you to read this
[1:49:22] right here and then we'll close
[1:49:29] Glory
[1:49:30] sometimes we don't read all of them
[1:49:32] right we'll be fulfilled all that has
[1:49:36] been promised for his word and the
[1:49:39] Virgin who knows no man-made Creed
[1:49:42] or Dogma right are you part of that
[1:49:45] great that's the question you gotta
[1:49:47] answer but out of the true sea
[1:49:50] will come a group right
[1:49:55] thank you
[1:49:56] Harvest Time
[1:49:57] 1964.
[1:50:02] look hurry there must come a true seed
[1:50:05] there has just got to be because he's
[1:50:07] coming for the bride will not spot a
[1:50:09] wrinkle
[1:50:11] now let's stop right there
[1:50:14] if you're a bride for spot and wrinkle
[1:50:15] you're going to die and go by the grave
[1:50:17] right
[1:50:18] I'm talking about this outside guy all
[1:50:21] right the inside guy's never going to
[1:50:22] die right this I got never had to spot a
[1:50:25] wrinkle the inside guy never never
[1:50:26] cussed it never run around and never
[1:50:27] fooled around never said a bad word amen
[1:50:30] but we gotta deal with this guy yeah
[1:50:32] cause we're still connected yes right
[1:50:34] because he's coming for the bride
[1:50:36] without spotter wrinkle he's coming for
[1:50:37] it a word Vindicated Brian oh she'll be
[1:50:40] such a little bitty group Jesus said as
[1:50:43] it was in today's the north where an
[1:50:45] eight Souls were saved is that right so
[1:50:46] shall it being the coming of the son of
[1:50:48] man how many I don't know right but of
[1:50:51] course the bride's gonna be made up of
[1:50:52] millions you read in the Bible but
[1:50:54] that's down to the ages
[1:50:56] we're talking about this age right here
[1:50:58] not worried about another age all right
[1:51:03] let's read one more
[1:51:05] another joke if I can find it
[1:51:15] Satan's not there with a shot 429 1965.
[1:51:20] he must have knew that was the next one
[1:51:21] I was going to read he shall be lying
[1:51:24] about the evening time
[1:51:26] seed come forth from Mary but it was not
[1:51:30] her seed it was the promise of God right
[1:51:33] now she was a carrier
[1:51:36] so Mary doesn't have anything to do with
[1:51:38] it
[1:51:40] but the true seed must come
[1:51:42] right exactly
[1:51:44] Mary top Pentecost remember the show
[1:51:46] exactly she wasn't the seed but now
[1:51:50] then she became the seed right sure
[1:51:52] right in the upper room exactly when she
[1:51:55] went to the upper room and became born
[1:51:57] again she received the one that she
[1:51:59] birthed naturally she received it
[1:52:01] spiritually man okay so we don't do it
[1:52:04] see you somebody said well that Mary was
[1:52:05] just dog no she's not dog meat no
[1:52:09] he's making a point he's giving you a
[1:52:11] tie
[1:52:12] he produces the seed come forth from her
[1:52:15] Jesus Christ but she had nothing to do
[1:52:18] with it that's right your sisters can't
[1:52:20] say that let's just be honest if you
[1:52:22] have children you can't say that that's
[1:52:24] right you can't say if you didn't have
[1:52:25] anything to do with it that's right yeah
[1:52:27] hello you did but now Mary didn't
[1:52:31] America said be it unto me according to
[1:52:33] Thy word that's right but it was not her
[1:52:35] seed it was the promise of God Amen
[1:52:38] the carry of life was the woman and I
[1:52:40] married the seed so much closer see
[1:52:42] that's what we are so much closer
[1:52:45] because we're not married
[1:52:48] right now like I said Mary became part
[1:52:51] of the Bride she became part of the sea
[1:52:52] but
[1:52:53] she didn't have anything to do with that
[1:52:55] the first part that's right she did have
[1:52:57] something to do with the second part
[1:52:58] right same way with you and I you can't
[1:53:01] you and I can't deal and worry
[1:53:05] with what got this here amen
[1:53:10] somebody stand up and tell me you had
[1:53:13] one thing to do with getting here yeah
[1:53:19] your Mom and Daddy really didn't have
[1:53:21] anything with getting you here
[1:53:24] because everybody understands what goes
[1:53:27] on in the in the conception part
[1:53:30] but
[1:53:32] you know what this is the way I
[1:53:34] understand God
[1:53:35] it's okay
[1:53:37] going to be anyway
[1:53:40] um
[1:53:41] if I was God and you then how many
[1:53:43] children if you how many children you
[1:53:45] got three if you knew before the before
[1:53:47] you were even before you were just a
[1:53:49] little girl I mean you were just a baby
[1:53:50] I'm gonna have three kids
[1:53:52] and they're gonna be
[1:53:54] whoever you got right now
[1:53:56] and brother dick says okay that's fine
[1:53:57] we you know they meet and brother dick
[1:54:00] says well we're gonna have three kids
[1:54:02] that's the way God is
[1:54:04] you can't go in god you can't because
[1:54:06] remember the seed of the word is what
[1:54:08] comes predestinated eternally right you
[1:54:10] can't go into the body of God and go
[1:54:12] well where's Brother Dean was right here
[1:54:14] he was that little spot right here in
[1:54:16] the back no you can't do that
[1:54:18] Josh was a part of me when I was a baby
[1:54:21] yeah right amen let's just take a
[1:54:23] natural story just for a minute
[1:54:24] everybody okay you're not sleepy I know
[1:54:25] people not sleeping I'm over here in
[1:54:27] your face but
[1:54:28] um
[1:54:29] maybe you want to do this more days but
[1:54:32] preach on him but but look
[1:54:35] Josh was it that very person look let's
[1:54:38] be real that gray person right here was
[1:54:40] inside of me when I was born right
[1:54:43] right
[1:54:45] it's flesh who he is his DNA strain was
[1:54:51] in me when I was a baby
[1:54:53] when I brought that could you take and
[1:54:55] do some kind of anatomy and inspection
[1:54:57] and go on where was Josh
[1:55:00] no he was he was in my DNA makeup
[1:55:04] right
[1:55:06] but now we know what happened
[1:55:10] the 16 elements I ate it it became me it
[1:55:14] became blood blood become compressed and
[1:55:17] become sperm then we know what happened
[1:55:19] then here come Josh but now did I know
[1:55:22] exactly where he was at any time in my
[1:55:25] body
[1:55:26] Yeti was there that's right you can't
[1:55:29] deny it because there is
[1:55:33] right he looks like me plus his heart
[1:55:36] but he's got my DNA makeup he's supposed
[1:55:39] to look like me he's not supposed to
[1:55:40] look like brother Rick thank you
[1:55:44] you know I mean really
[1:55:47] so what about God
[1:55:50] put him out gone
[1:55:52] could you find that seed or word
[1:55:55] could you find that anywhere
[1:55:57] thank you
[1:55:58] but you were there amen and what that
[1:56:01] attribute right exactly you were in that
[1:56:04] attribute
[1:56:07] the word of God is a seed right right
[1:56:10] the word is a seed so you were there
[1:56:13] it's the seed or word that was
[1:56:15] predestinated
[1:56:16] then just like I said before
[1:56:19] when you got here as a human
[1:56:21] you responded to that part exactly and
[1:56:24] then what did God do
[1:56:25] he took part of his own life
[1:56:28] his DNA makeup because I believe God's a
[1:56:31] human being right
[1:56:32] he took his DNA strain and said
[1:56:37] there's my daughter
[1:56:39] just like brother dick and sister Gail
[1:56:41] could have done if they'd have known if
[1:56:42] they would have been you know if they
[1:56:44] knew eternity
[1:56:46] they know how many kids it's going to
[1:56:47] have right
[1:56:48] right that's Eternal he knew how many
[1:56:51] kids he's gonna have because they were
[1:56:52] inside of it not in a spot I've seen
[1:56:55] preachers try to draw spots y'all have
[1:56:57] two you know I was right no
[1:57:00] God is the word
[1:57:03] which is a Living Word
[1:57:05] and what he was when I was walking
[1:57:07] around I didn't wonder where I was going
[1:57:09] to get my kids from
[1:57:11] I knew where they was going to come from
[1:57:14] but see we all come through sexual
[1:57:15] desire
[1:57:18] but when you're born again you come to
[1:57:19] spoken word desires amen what the desire
[1:57:23] that you had for the word amen you
[1:57:27] desired your husband yes and he made you
[1:57:30] a child
[1:57:32] and now
[1:57:33] we can understand
[1:57:36] the Redemption of the body right
[1:57:39] because it's not somewhere we got to go
[1:57:40] get exactly it's right here it's now
[1:57:45] everybody
[1:57:52] who's going to make it
[1:57:54] I am man that's right that's all you got
[1:57:57] to say who's gonna make it I am
[1:58:01] it's not going to be me flesh me you
[1:58:03] looking at it's going to be the one
[1:58:04] inside of me amen that about 11 years 11
[1:58:07] years ago
[1:58:09] I gave my heart to the Lord
[1:58:11] I made mistakes on the way
[1:58:14] but you know what
[1:58:16] if he'd have looked at all of Abraham's
[1:58:18] mistakes
[1:58:20] I mean this guy was a father of our
[1:58:23] faith yeah
[1:58:24] and he didn't just laugh at God inside
[1:58:27] like you know you know Sarah just said
[1:58:29] me and my husband have fun again you
[1:58:32] know
[1:58:33] no the Bible says Abraham got down on
[1:58:37] the ground and laughed in front of God
[1:58:39] right right
[1:58:41] he gave his wife away twice don't ever
[1:58:44] try that once
[1:58:47] he gave it but he did he tried to give
[1:58:49] her away twice that's right but yet when
[1:58:52] Paul wrote about him
[1:58:56] he said he was strong right in faith
[1:59:00] never wavering
[1:59:03] and he was the father
[1:59:05] of our faith why
[1:59:09] because he saw that baby
[1:59:12] and it didn't matter sister Anna what
[1:59:13] happened during that Journey
[1:59:15] didn't matter there was a glass standing
[1:59:17] away for Dave from David
[1:59:19] there was a spot
[1:59:21] and I'm gonna tell you something people
[1:59:22] let's see him we gotta find that we
[1:59:24] don't have to find that spot we know
[1:59:27] where the spot is we know what's in the
[1:59:28] word of God but we've got to believe
[1:59:30] that we can get there yes right Abraham
[1:59:34] believed he could get there amen Gloria
[1:59:36] Abraham the whole difference in Abraham
[1:59:39] and the rest of them was he believed
[1:59:41] that he was going to have that son
[1:59:44] did not matter did he you know what
[1:59:47] Abraham was a hundred years old when God
[1:59:50] changed his body right
[1:59:52] now and all of you know him nobody's
[1:59:53] made a hundred yet
[1:59:55] some of you getting close
[2:00:00] but do you really want kids when you're
[2:00:02] that old
[2:00:04] even in Abraham's Humanity
[2:00:07] it's like
[2:00:08] gee
[2:00:11] but no you know what Abraham said I'm
[2:00:14] going to have that child it does not
[2:00:15] matter if I'm 190.
[2:00:17] because God promised it right so here's
[2:00:20] the baby brother Brown said he's had the
[2:00:21] baby it's like he had it in his arms
[2:00:23] Gloria so what happened was he he did
[2:00:26] not
[2:00:27] he did not and Paul did not account the
[2:00:30] Journey of Abraham right against him
[2:00:33] exactly he's not going to count your
[2:00:35] journey against you if
[2:00:38] you see the Promise now if you don't say
[2:00:41] the promise and you you're doing this
[2:00:43] through your journey now God's not going
[2:00:44] to count that to you
[2:00:46] but when you have a spot you've got to
[2:00:48] get to
[2:00:49] and you know you're getting there
[2:00:51] and you know what's happening to you
[2:00:53] all right
[2:00:55] I can't make it happen to brother Aaron
[2:00:57] he's going to make it happen to himself
[2:00:59] but God's Made A Way amen God's Made A
[2:01:02] Way Gloria let's sing a song you love
[2:01:05] the Lord
[2:01:18] okay come around here we're standing on
[2:01:20] Holy Ground and
[2:01:23] Holy Mountain
[2:01:25] was God on the mountain made the
[2:01:27] mountain holy
[2:01:28] where's her holy it's what I said about
[2:01:30] being confident being arrogant you be
[2:01:32] arrogant and you'd be in bad shape but
[2:01:35] we must have confidence that God has
[2:01:37] given us the ability now
[2:01:40] to make this thing to the very end amen
[2:01:43] I believe 100
[2:01:45] I believe this new prophets are alive
[2:01:49] taking changes in the bodies alive
[2:01:59] oh
[2:02:05] all right
[2:02:12] foreign
[2:03:21] at this stage
[2:03:22] going
[2:03:44] away
[2:03:55] Peter and them you know were walking to
[2:03:58] the gate beautiful
[2:03:59] and describing you know what happened to
[2:04:02] them and then people being healed in
[2:04:03] their Shadow and I kind of felt a little
[2:04:05] chat you can do that while you're
[2:04:07] preaching don't worry perhaps all of us
[2:04:11] but listen how do you know that hadn't
[2:04:14] happened amen
[2:04:16] sorry I didn't mean to say that I mean
[2:04:20] I'm really sorry honestly I thought I
[2:04:22] shouldn't have said that because we
[2:04:23] don't know it could have happened that's
[2:04:25] right you never know that
[2:04:28] you never know because the same God is
[2:04:30] there
[2:04:30] is here now
[2:04:33] and he's more in manifestation now than
[2:04:37] he was then
[2:04:38] see that's why we have to leave a clean
[2:04:41] life
[2:04:42] we have to ask God to forgive us daily
[2:04:45] that's right you know if you don't then
[2:04:48] I want to come live with you for a day
[2:04:49] or two I'll sure make you repent of
[2:04:53] something
[2:04:55] but you know what he's put people there
[2:04:57] to try you
[2:05:00] but we must be confident in what God has
[2:05:03] made us people
[2:05:07] arrogance is of the devil if you think
[2:05:09] you're better than somebody else no no
[2:05:11] but it's he that has made us yes not we
[2:05:15] ourselves
[2:05:17] when I was born in this world in this
[2:05:19] natural world I didn't have anything to
[2:05:21] do with it
[2:05:23] but God knew that when I come to the age
[2:05:26] I'm sorry that it was so long
[2:05:29] that I would want him more than life
[2:05:32] itself amen now he would do that he'd do
[2:05:35] the same thing for you right but you
[2:05:38] gotta want it right
[2:05:40] you gotta want it you gotta want more
[2:05:43] God more than anything
[2:05:45] in this natural world
[2:05:48] tonight
[2:05:52] okay
[2:05:53] let's say 369 I'll Fly Away
[2:07:12] cause I had
[2:07:16] already wrote that song
[2:07:18] later
[2:08:20] join the Lord be with you
[2:08:32] I am
[2:08:50] my way
