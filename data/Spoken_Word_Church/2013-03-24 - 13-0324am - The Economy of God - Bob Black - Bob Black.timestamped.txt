[9:23] of in the old testament how
[9:25] the lord when they were
[9:28] they went under the shed blood under the
[9:30] covering of the door to feast on your
[9:32] word

[10:26] lord we ask you that you'll be with us
[10:28] this morning in your name
[10:30] in the name of our precious lord and
[10:32] savior jesus christ
[10:35] amen amen
[10:38] ezekiel chapter 1 verse 15 and 16 says
[10:43] now as i beheld the living creatures
[10:46] behold one will upon the earth by the
[10:48] living creatures with his four faces
[10:50] the appearance of the wheels and their
[10:52] work was like unto the color of a barrel
[10:54] and they had and they four had one
[10:56] likeness and their appearance and their
[10:58] work was as it were a wheel in the
[10:59] middle of a wheel
[11:01] now let's go to ephesians chapter three
[11:07] and read just a little bit of this
[11:12] for this call that thy paul
[11:14] the prisoner of jesus christ for you
[11:16] gentiles
[11:18] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[11:20] the grace of god which is given to me
[11:22] given me to your word
[11:24] how that by revelation he made known to
[11:26] me the mystery
[11:27] as i wrote before in a few words
[11:30] then we'll just stop right there
[11:31] you may be seated
[11:37] unless anybody just wants to remain
[11:39] standing
[11:43] but i wanted to speak this morning on
[11:45] this word dispensation
[11:48] that in the original greek was is where
[11:50] we get our word economy and the original
[11:53] greek the word was economia
[11:57] and uh
[11:59] just talk about how god has an economy
[12:02] that's built around his word the
[12:03] revelation of his word and the spirit
[12:05] moving in the people in his church and
[12:09] paul talked about how that he was given
[12:11] uh a dispensation that you know the the
[12:13] full the complete plan is like a ruler
[12:16] that's divided up into little pieces the
[12:18] full plan is there's god expressing
[12:20] himself that's what the full plan is and
[12:24] paul had he saw that he had part of that
[12:26] plan to begin to express god and and
[12:30] what to them was a mystery that was
[12:31] being unveiled that god would express
[12:34] himself in a people that
[12:35] that uh
[12:37] the jews excuse me the jews thought
[12:39] would not be called the people that were
[12:41] pulled from all different parts of the
[12:43] earth that unclean people the gentiles
[12:46] and
[12:47] so paul began to uh
[12:49] he
[12:50] if you look all down through the
[12:52] scripture there's so many wonderful
[12:54] scriptures about
[12:56] this mystery
[12:58] right
[12:58] now the thing about a mystery is
[13:01] it's it's something that we don't know
[13:03] what it is
[13:04] and until it's un revealed then uh it
[13:07] can't be fulfilled
[13:09] because how we don't know what it is
[13:11] uh
[13:12] to paul
[13:13] this mystery of the scripture being
[13:16] thank you brother
[13:17] revealed to the uh that god will express
[13:21] himself in a gentile church and the
[13:23] gentile dispensation
[13:25] would uh because it was revealed to paul
[13:28] then now it can be made manifest
[13:31] and then
[13:33] first let's see ephesians chapter 1
[13:35] verses 9 through 10 he said having made
[13:38] known just the mystery of his reveal
[13:40] according to his good pleasure he has
[13:42] purposed in himself that in the
[13:43] dispensation of the fullness of times
[13:46] he might gather together and want all
[13:48] things in christ both which are in
[13:49] heaven and which are on earth
[13:52] even in him
[13:53] so as we go through these scriptures and
[13:55] go through this little lesson
[13:57] just picture in your mind the ezekiel
[14:00] the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[14:02] because this is that's the the symbol of
[14:05] the economy of god that i'd be speaking
[14:07] of
[14:08] and then colossians 1 chapter 1 25-27
[14:13] paul tells us the full picture of this
[14:15] mystery
[14:17] he said wherever i have made a minister
[14:20] according to the dispensation of god
[14:22] which is given to me for you
[14:24] to fulfill the word
[14:26] even the mystery which have been hid
[14:28] from ages and from generations but now
[14:30] is made manifest to his saints
[14:33] to whom god will make known what is the
[14:34] riches of the glory of this mystery
[14:36] among the gentiles
[14:38] which is
[14:39] christ in you and the hope of glory
[14:44] now let me uh
[14:46] i just want to
[14:47] start off by going to uh
[14:52] john chapter six
[14:54] and let's uh
[14:57] kind of go through this
[14:59] because this is a picture
[15:02] of an economy
[15:04] that jesus in the middle and the church
[15:06] spread around right ready to receive the
[15:09] word
[15:17] and uh to set the stage
[15:19] we can read the story across all of the
[15:21] four gospels and kind of get a better
[15:24] picture there's some things that mark
[15:26] includes that john didn't include
[15:29] and uh we know that this this story
[15:32] happened after john the baptist had died
[15:35] they think about how you know the
[15:37] messenger for your day has gone off the
[15:39] scene what's going to happen who's going
[15:41] to lead the people where do we receive
[15:42] our word from is there any particular
[15:44] man that we're going to receive our
[15:45] orders from or is it from where where do
[15:49] we get our word right after these things
[15:51] jesus went over the sea of galilee which
[15:53] is the sea of tiberias
[15:55] and a great multitude followed him
[15:57] because they saw his miracles which he
[15:58] did on them that were diseased
[16:00] and jesus went up into a mountain and
[16:02] there he sat with us with his disciples
[16:06] and the passover the feast of the jews
[16:08] was nigh
[16:10] and why was that included in this
[16:12] because the passover is where
[16:15] the lamb was eaten exactly you eat the
[16:18] word right exactly and now here the word
[16:20] is in their midst and they fail to
[16:22] recognize who he is
[16:24] when jesus then lifted up his eyes and
[16:26] saw a great company come unto him
[16:28] he's saying to philip
[16:30] when shall we buy bread
[16:33] that these may eat now the first thing i
[16:35] want to point out is that jesus and
[16:38] john's little tailing of it jesus is the
[16:40] first one to be concerned and if you
[16:42] ever wonder is god concerned about me is
[16:45] he yeah right
[16:47] that's right exactly amen
[16:51] you know
[16:52] sometimes we think
[16:53] god doesn't care about me
[16:56] nobody nobody cares but he was the first
[16:59] one to speak he was one i was concerned
[17:02] all right he entered into the situation
[17:04] with compassion and you know in romans
[17:06] it tells us that
[17:09] we should when other when others are are
[17:11] joyful we should be joyful with them
[17:14] we should weep with him and so jesus was
[17:16] he wasn't just getting there right all
[17:18] these poor people that don't know
[17:20] anything he was he entered into them
[17:22] with compassion and he wanted he asked
[17:26] phillip where are we gonna buy where
[17:29] where can we get bread
[17:30] now in mark's telling other story
[17:33] philip responded we need to send them
[17:36] away yeah yeah
[17:37] all right because in other words we
[17:39] don't have we don't have them here
[17:44] and a lot of times down through life
[17:46] you'll see
[17:47] you just observing uh people's reaction
[17:50] to the word they
[17:51] fail to recognize the word in their
[17:53] midst right and this he said to prove
[17:56] him for he himself knew what he would do
[17:58] philip answered him 200 penny worth of
[18:01] bread is not sufficient for them
[18:03] that every one of them may take a little
[18:05] just a little bit all right philip
[18:07] wanted them to have just a little bit
[18:10] and you know he made a calculation he
[18:12] figured up in his head how much money it
[18:15] would take to buy
[18:17] enough food for all these people but he
[18:19] failed to make a calculation that he
[18:21] failed to add in that christ
[18:24] he didn't add that to the calculation
[18:26] one of his disciples andrew simon
[18:28] peter's brother said unto him there is a
[18:31] lad here which has five body loads and
[18:34] two small fishes but what are they among
[18:36] so many
[18:38] and jesus said make the men sit down now
[18:42] that's an important point too because
[18:44] a lot of times
[18:45] we hurry and we bustle around we don't
[18:47] take time a quiet time just get along
[18:50] with god and let him speak to us we're
[18:53] hustling and bustling to and fro but uh
[18:56] you know another thing that when the
[18:58] word is in was that when the word is in
[19:00] control when you yield yourself to the
[19:02] word then the word begins to put things
[19:04] in order right mark martin
[19:07] the gospel of mark mark tells us that
[19:10] they sat down
[19:12] by
[19:12] 100 by by uh they sat down in ranks of
[19:17] 50s and hundreds
[19:18] because the word was in their midst they
[19:20] ordered them and the word
[19:22] is it begins to order and place your
[19:25] doctrine and your life and it has to
[19:26] move everything and put it in just the
[19:29] right place
[19:31] that's what i'm talking about this
[19:32] morning
[19:33] the placing of the word and the economy
[19:35] of god in your life and in your church
[19:37] and
[19:38] everything everything that where god is
[19:41] and jesus took the loaves
[19:46] and when he had given thanks
[19:48] he distributed to the disciples
[19:50] and the disciples to them that were shut
[19:52] down
[19:53] and likewise of the fishes as much as
[19:55] they would as much as they would because
[19:58] i'm not thirsty i'll be feeling right
[20:02] now it's interesting that in this little
[20:05] story that
[20:06] jesus broke the bread and you might
[20:08] stand you can stand back from this
[20:11] congregation and maybe look at what
[20:15] say what's different between this church
[20:17] and the church next door what's
[20:18] different between all the different
[20:19] churches you maybe have took a step back
[20:22] and looked at this scene of jesus
[20:24] breaking the bread and hanging out to
[20:26] the disciples and thought well they're
[20:27] just they're just a bunch of people
[20:29] eating
[20:30] they're eating but something was
[20:32] happening
[20:40] distributed out dispensed right
[20:44] to the people that sat around
[20:46] and uh so looking at the scene maybe one
[20:49] of the people that were sitting there
[20:50] might say well this brother brother
[20:52] phillip brother andrew but phillips
[20:54] bringing the bread and the loaves he has
[20:57] given it to someone that's that's hungry
[20:59] right that's thirsting right and he's
[21:01] giving it to them they receive it with
[21:03] thanksgiving
[21:04] and they say philip you're the one that
[21:07] broke the bread
[21:08] but that would be incorrect
[21:14] i'm standing here today not to introduce
[21:16] you to myself right but the introduction
[21:18] of christ
[21:24] you know
[21:25] the corinthians had that problem when
[21:27] paul began to preach to them he said you
[21:29] think that you're saved because that you
[21:32] you've been baptized by me or by apollos
[21:34] about uh any of these other brothers you
[21:36] think that's that's what your faith is
[21:38] based on but you can't base your economy
[21:41] your your fear of what you believe
[21:43] you're the rock that you're finding your
[21:45] revelation is based on right on on where
[21:48] you go to church or who baptized you or
[21:51] uh that i am
[21:53] i'm a message believer i go to a message
[21:56] church you've got to have an experience
[22:05] so um
[22:08] then further on down you know they they
[22:10] did recognize in this little story that
[22:13] who jesus was because they recognized
[22:15] that he was breaking the bread and
[22:17] further down in verse 26 jesus answered
[22:20] and said very very i say unto you you
[22:22] seek me not because you saw the miracles
[22:25] but because you didn't eat of the loaves
[22:27] and were filled
[22:28] you labor not for the meat which
[22:30] perishes but for that meat which
[22:33] endureth unto everlasting life which the
[22:35] son of man shall give unto you for him
[22:37] half the father have god the father
[22:40] sealed right right that's the whole
[22:42] point of the christian journey to eat
[22:44] and eat
[22:45] right
[22:46] manifest in you
[22:51] now
[22:52] i want to take a little maybe
[22:55] paint a big picture across
[22:57] the all the whole scripture this morning
[22:59] from the beginning to the end and let's
[23:02] start at john 1 1 in the beginning now
[23:05] you know the only thing that god that
[23:07] brother graham said that the only prayer
[23:09] that jesus had
[23:11] one thing he really wanted
[23:13] right before he went to glory was
[23:15] that i go where i go you may be also
[23:18] that was his desire
[23:20] where he would have fellowship with us
[23:22] and that was his desire all the way from
[23:24] the beginning and jesus didn't start
[23:27] christ didn't start at
[23:29] the in the cradle he started we read
[23:31] john john chapter one right he was he
[23:34] was the one that created the world
[23:37] all things
[23:38] and
[23:39] go all the way back to the beginning
[23:41] where he began in genesis chapter 1
[23:44] verse 1 he created the heavens and the
[23:46] earth
[23:46] and
[23:47] he created he spun out by the word uh
[23:50] the solar system
[23:52] and the galaxies and everything now
[23:54] picture this now
[23:56] he created the sun
[23:58] and then as the planets just to to
[24:00] create a little picture the planets
[24:02] began to zoom by the big old jupiter
[24:06] the sun caught it and moved it right
[24:09] into its orbit and they couldn't escape
[24:12] the power of the sun right it moved it
[24:14] right in line right as big as jupiter as
[24:17] you think my i got a problem in my life
[24:19] it's too big for the world you know i
[24:21] got i got something that that god's word
[24:24] just can't can't tackle but now jupiter
[24:27] moved right in and orbit around and was
[24:30] placed positionally
[24:32] just right perfectly in orbit and from
[24:34] then on it never deviated it's just so
[24:37] perfect how all the all the planets move
[24:40] then and just the concert
[24:42] and then
[24:43] god began to uh he created
[24:47] he created another economy in heaven
[24:49] an economy of angels
[24:52] and he created
[24:54] the seraphims the burners that take
[24:56] the prayers of the saints and offered
[24:59] him up in in the temple and you know
[25:01] moses when he went up in the mountain to
[25:03] to create the
[25:05] god showed him the tabernacle for the
[25:07] saint for the for the uh the
[25:10] israelites to worship for moses the
[25:12] pattern of the tabernacle
[25:14] um
[25:16] brother brown said what he really saw
[25:17] was he saw solomon's temple with the
[25:20] pillars right and uh because you know
[25:23] it's written in isaiah that the the
[25:26] when the seraphim's cried holy holy is
[25:28] the lord of hosts that they actually
[25:30] shook the pillars of the temple right
[25:32] with their praise and uh
[25:35] so he had a whole economy in heaven that
[25:39] moses modeled the tabernacle after it
[25:41] right a whole economy built around his
[25:43] word
[25:45] the seraphims were placed the cherubims
[25:47] gabriel michael all different eight
[25:49] world war the different angels that had
[25:51] different tasks wormwood
[25:53] uh the judgment angel and and all the
[25:55] different angels and they had an economy
[25:57] placed around his word
[25:59] and uh lucifer didn't realize
[26:02] what was going on right he thought i'm
[26:05] so holy and you know yeah
[26:07] we we've met people before that we we
[26:09] know someone
[26:11] we met someone before that
[26:12] uh
[26:14] had visions and things
[26:16] because i have visions yeah then give
[26:19] them a message book and they said well
[26:21] that's that's not right and fail to
[26:23] recognize the word right right and uh
[26:25] present
[26:26] uh
[26:27] just the simplicity of of how you should
[26:30] a woman should cut or not cut her hair
[26:32] and
[26:33] live holy before god
[26:35] and uh
[26:36] we talked a lot about this in that
[26:38] little bible study at home about how the
[26:40] bible was so plain to say that a woman's
[26:43] hair is giving her for recovering right
[26:45] and usually it's just written there in
[26:47] black and white right and fails it
[26:48] doesn't really even need a revelation to
[26:50] see that you
[26:55] maybe sometimes we think we're so holy
[26:58] that uh uh we don't need
[27:01] we fail to recognize god's word right
[27:03] but and that's exactly what happened to
[27:05] lucifer in isaiah it's written how he
[27:07] was he was so
[27:09] you know he was the the
[27:10] most decorated angel so beautiful he had
[27:13] that beautiful singing voice and you
[27:16] know that's another thing you think my
[27:18] goodness if we only had such a uh
[27:22] you look at other churches and think if
[27:24] they had if we could have a song service
[27:26] like that and then you watch a song
[27:28] leader that's that you think is so
[27:30] wonderful and then fall and start
[27:32] putting up websites about how uh this
[27:35] message isn't true and things right uh
[27:37] because they fail to recognize the word
[27:40] and uh
[27:41] so lucifer
[27:43] you know brother branham said that
[27:44] michael was christ right but when
[27:46] michael stepped out he didn't know who
[27:48] that was right and started a war with it
[27:51] and uh then they took the war down
[27:54] to uh
[27:55] to heaven to earth and um
[27:59] you know god began to create he he he's
[28:03] a god of different economies the same
[28:05] economy with his word
[28:07] in the in the middle
[28:09] and um
[28:11] so what he did is the whole purpose of
[28:14] his grand design is to express himself
[28:17] right so he came down to earth he
[28:21] he began to reach out
[28:24] and pull from this place potash a little
[28:27] bit of this place from clay
[28:29] and a little bit of this place and some
[28:30] dirt from over here and you know you
[28:32] look at each of these little pieces of
[28:34] dirt and say well that
[28:36] that's there's nothing to that
[28:38] look out in this congregation and look
[28:40] at each individual one and say well
[28:43] uh you know this this brother may not be
[28:46] too much to look at or they came from a
[28:48] bad background or something what can god
[28:50] do with this person but again he began
[28:53] to mold it into a pressure and pulled it
[28:55] all together and
[28:57] brought out from the dust of the earth
[28:59] brother said he actually had
[29:01] he was he had when god molded this man
[29:03] he had one foot stuck in the ground and
[29:05] he was stuck there right and then he
[29:08] breathed into him the breath of life the
[29:10] eternal life
[29:11] and that word that was inside of adam
[29:13] began to move
[29:15] everything the the
[29:17] what god had molded together out of the
[29:18] mud and out of the clay moved it
[29:20] together into a perfect little solar
[29:22] system where god where adam was
[29:24] fortified behind the word
[29:26] and remember adam could not be deceived
[29:28] right
[29:29] right
[29:32] so lucifer's looking at this situation
[29:34] how can i get in here he's fortified
[29:38] behind god's word
[29:40] how can i how can i get into this
[29:42] picture
[29:43] okay where can i stick a pry bar to get
[29:45] in right i can't go into him yeah so i'm
[29:48] gonna have to get him to come out to me
[29:49] right yeah and that's what if you stay
[29:52] fortified behind god's word i just read
[29:54] through all the scriptures where brother
[29:56] god talked about being fortified behind
[29:57] his god's word and you know it's really
[30:00] our choice to stay fortified behind
[30:03] it's your choice how much time you want
[30:05] to spend praying and reading his bible
[30:07] right and and
[30:09] developing a close relationship with him
[30:13] so
[30:17] lucifer could see with his eyes but not
[30:20] but not by revelation right
[30:22] and then the same thing happened with e
[30:24] for she couldn't she could see with her
[30:27] eyes but
[30:28] uh she she missed she missed god's point
[30:31] god's
[30:32] his great his grand plan was the same
[30:34] thing that it is today
[30:36] to express himself right and she
[30:38] couldn't hold on until the spoken word
[30:40] was made manifest and the children of
[30:42] god that would be brought forth
[30:46] now
[30:48] go back to the angels now because this
[30:49] is a good point to think about think
[30:51] about you a lot of times going through
[30:53] life's problems and things you think
[30:55] well i'm alone
[30:56] but god created a whole economy in
[30:59] heaven this is what lucifer lucifer
[31:01] didn't see but he created a whole
[31:03] economy in heaven around fulfilling his
[31:06] word right here all right all right
[31:09] that's right
[31:10] he created all of these angels we're
[31:12] trying to help you
[31:14] so that you could bring him and bring
[31:17] him into being
[31:19] in luke 15 10 i'm just going to read
[31:21] through some of these scriptures there's
[31:22] joy in the presence of the angels of god
[31:24] over one sinner
[31:27] somebody says i i believe that all of
[31:30] the angels there's a
[31:45] want to know these secret things
[31:46] in luke 2 13 it says they uh they were
[31:49] praising god over the fields of
[31:51] shepherds to announce that savior was
[31:53] born amen the savior
[31:55] in luke 1 26 that gabriel announced the
[31:58] birth of the messiah luke 22 43 the
[32:00] angels were present in the reciprocal
[32:02] where the lord rushed in acts 1 10
[32:05] he uh
[32:06] it said which also said he men of
[32:08] galilee watch stand you gazing up into
[32:10] heaven this same jesus which is taken up
[32:12] from you into heaven so shall come in
[32:14] like manner as you have seen monday
[32:16] night and in psalm 34 7 the angel of the
[32:19] lord and campus round the batman that
[32:21] fear him
[32:22] and deliver them
[32:24] and in genesis 19 1-15
[32:27] uh the angels rescued a lot from sodom
[32:30] right and just only on how the angels
[32:32] are concerned with the revenge of
[32:34] mankind they're not just sitting up
[32:36] there
[32:37] watching things but they're active
[32:38] because god created a whole economy
[32:41] right here based on his with the center
[32:43] of his word right the whole thing is is
[32:45] based on him right it's centered on him
[32:48] and created an economy
[32:50] just to express himself and the economy
[32:53] that was expressed in the garden of eden
[32:54] an economy uh
[32:57] that was expressed in this creation and
[32:59] the solar system and an economy is
[33:01] expressed in this church right here the
[33:03] common that's expressed right then you
[33:05] and me individually that's right
[33:07] and you know in the garden of eden their
[33:09] economy was placed around
[33:11] the tree of life
[33:12] they uh
[33:13] every every evening they cool in the
[33:15] evening they would they would walk to
[33:17] see
[33:18] the center of that economy the whole
[33:20] garden right to speak with him and
[33:22] fantasy
[33:24] they just lost sight of
[33:26] of the uh of the vision right man
[33:30] now
[33:33] switch gears a little bit and move on
[33:35] down to moses and the 10 commandments
[33:38] you know how they
[33:40] they uh
[33:41] they waited
[33:42] for moses when moses went up for 40 days
[33:45] they were waiting for his word to be
[33:48] made manifest right they were waiting
[33:50] for
[33:51] what turned out to be
[33:52] the god the word of god made manifest
[33:55] and tables of stone right uh and you
[33:57] know they couldn't wait for that to
[34:00] happen they became impatient and he had
[34:02] a doubt and reason in their hearts right
[34:04] and uh you know remember we were talking
[34:06] about enoch last time how enoch was this
[34:09] this the tortoise wins the race slow and
[34:12] steady right so just hang on keep
[34:14] hanging on keep believing god's word
[34:17] because you can't hang on by yourself
[34:24] but then they they waited for that those
[34:27] tablets to come down from the mountain
[34:29] and when they did moses found them they
[34:31] had taken a substitute they had moved
[34:33] the center of their economy which was
[34:35] the word and then moved it to something
[34:37] else golden calves and they began to put
[34:39] all their focus on that right just like
[34:42] lucifer moved the center of his economy
[34:43] from michael on himself
[34:46] and he moved the center of her economy
[34:48] from the tree of life onto what the
[34:51] beast had was preaching to her
[34:53] and they moved that center of their
[34:55] economy onto the golden caps
[34:58] and the hope that that would in the vain
[35:01] hope that that would be a better
[35:03] situation
[35:05] now
[35:06] moses took he
[35:08] remember he had that model for the uh
[35:10] the the tabernacle in the wilderness so
[35:13] he took those tab those tablets and he
[35:16] put them in the in the center of that
[35:17] little model yeah
[35:20] in the center of the of the uh
[35:22] of the tabernacle in the wilderness
[35:24] along with aaron's rod that butted and
[35:27] the manna and as they journey through
[35:29] the wilderness they feasted on that man
[35:31] which you know in our day brother said
[35:34] to shout is that bread of life that came
[35:35] down in heaven we're feasting on this
[35:37] message
[35:38] and
[35:40] so they were eating on the manna
[35:43] they were feasting on it they were being
[35:45] led by the spirit the
[35:47] the center of their economy was the word
[35:50] and as they camped they all formed a
[35:53] little they all grouped clustered around
[35:56] the word
[35:58] and now um brothers if you want to go
[36:00] ahead and pull up that little picture
[36:02] um we i know we've looked at this before
[36:04] of how they camped around they are a jew
[36:07] and it's karin's england on the right
[36:08] hand side and benjamin and manasseh from
[36:10] on the left now or on the west and and
[36:14] the international natalie on the north
[36:15] and and so forth but now the levites
[36:19] had a special place they were real close
[36:22] real close to the word
[36:25] and why were they that close because god
[36:27] had chosen them based on their
[36:29] confession right in exodus 32 26 29 when
[36:32] moses came down and he saw what they had
[36:35] done moses stood in the camp of the gate
[36:37] and said who is on the lord's side let
[36:39] him come unto me
[36:40] and all the sons of levi gather
[36:43] themselves together unto him and he said
[36:44] unto them
[36:46] thus saith the lord god of israel put
[36:48] every man his sword by his side
[36:50] and go in and out from gate to gate
[36:52] throughout the camp and slay every man
[36:54] his brother that every man is companion
[36:57] every man is neighbor and the children
[36:59] of levi did according to the word of
[37:00] moses and their fellow people that day
[37:02] about 3 000 men
[37:05] now so
[37:06] they wanted they were close to the word
[37:09] right because they wanted to be close to
[37:12] the word right and i just want to
[37:13] impress you with that they wanted to be
[37:15] close to the word right so the question
[37:17] is how close do you want to be the word
[37:19] and i told this little story to the
[37:21] sunday school class
[37:22] um and uh
[37:24] this is one of those stories that's open
[37:26] for offense to open for maybe to be
[37:28] offended a little bit but bye but um
[37:32] i i tell the story about there was a
[37:34] the brother that married my um
[37:38] my sister-in-law and brother-in-law
[37:41] was down at a meeting in florida
[37:43] and he passed away during the service
[37:46] and
[37:48] the spirit of the lord was there in such
[37:49] a mighty way and brother billy paul was
[37:51] there and i'm not trying to glorify
[37:53] anybody or anything i'm just telling a
[37:54] story right and billy paul took the man
[37:57] and and they some of the other brothers
[38:00] took him and took him into the back room
[38:01] and began to pray for him
[38:03] and the angel of the lord showed up
[38:06] and
[38:07] the man was raised from the dead
[38:15] such a mighty presence was there in that
[38:17] place
[38:19] i wasn't there but it was told to me
[38:20] that the the spirit of the lord was so
[38:22] great in that place and one of the
[38:24] brothers uh said something that really
[38:26] impressed me was that you know as as
[38:30] great as that presence was in that place
[38:32] the pillar of fire
[38:34] you know you could just feel the
[38:35] presence of the lord that mighty wind
[38:37] moving through the building
[38:38] but you know you can have that same
[38:41] presence with you every day like life
[38:44] you know that's something to think about
[38:45] you know you think well i can only feel
[38:47] the presence of the lord when i come to
[38:49] church or when i when i spend hours and
[38:51] hours praying or or when i dedicate lots
[38:55] and lots of time but we should be
[38:58] huddled so close around the world until
[39:00] his presence is with us all the time not
[39:03] just some of the time right uh howard
[39:05] won't say that not just
[39:08] all the time
[39:10] and you know god does it
[39:13] you know that perusian doctrine was that
[39:15] he's over here or he's over there but i
[39:17] don't want him over there right just
[39:19] when i come to church but i want him
[39:20] with me all the time i want to take him
[39:25] so that's
[39:26] picture that in your mind the the
[39:29] levites were huddled around the word
[39:31] all of the israelites as they journeyed
[39:34] through the wilderness when they would
[39:35] travel they had a certain order they
[39:36] would unfold and they would just wheel
[39:38] out that wheel that ezekiel saw and they
[39:41] would move forth and when they would
[39:42] stop they would roll back around the ark
[39:45] and they would like circling the wagons
[39:47] and take the word right
[39:49] so
[39:50] lucifer is looking at that situation
[39:52] just like he looked at adam they're
[39:54] fortified behind the word of god how can
[39:57] i get in there how can i move upon the
[40:00] scene how can i
[40:02] what can i do
[40:04] and
[40:07] there was the mole bites balaam and
[40:09] bayli looked upon the scene
[40:12] and uh they like said we'll curse them
[40:14] yeah try try to curse them yeah so
[40:16] baylor tried as hard as he could you
[40:18] know he
[40:20] what balaam was trying to do was he was
[40:22] trying to be a negotiator between balak
[40:24] and god
[40:26] now
[40:28] how can you
[40:29] how can you negotiate with god
[40:31] hey like says one thing and balaam
[40:33] because running back well
[40:35] he didn't like that so much god now
[40:38] god uh
[40:41] you know that
[40:43] yeah
[40:44] um
[40:45] you know what numbers 22 12 13 let's
[40:48] let's see if we can read that real quick
[40:49] how how balaam
[40:52] i used to wonder when i was reading the
[40:54] scripture what what did balaam do that
[40:56] was so bad
[41:02] numbers 22 12
[41:05] and 13.
[41:22] and god said unto babel
[41:24] thou shalt not go with them right thou
[41:27] shalt not curse the people that's right
[41:29] for they are blessed amen
[41:31] and balaam now listen to this he's
[41:34] leaving stuff out
[41:36] just like
[41:37] the beast changed
[41:39] changed what god had said
[41:41] and balaam rose up in the morning and
[41:43] said unto the princes of bayley get you
[41:45] into your land for the lord refuses to
[41:47] give me leave to go with you
[41:49] and he said a whole lot more than that
[41:51] he said no
[41:52] right and uh so balaam tried to be a
[41:55] little negotiator and when that didn't
[41:57] work when he saw it these people were
[41:59] blessed despite all their little
[42:01] problems all the little things that they
[42:03] had done he failed to see that they had
[42:07] a
[42:07] sacrifice in the camp they had that
[42:10] brazen serpent to
[42:12] an offering for
[42:14] all the little problems that they had
[42:15] done
[42:16] he couldn't he couldn't understand how
[42:18] they could god would be with him that
[42:20] god would be unveiling his word and
[42:22] manifesting himself to them and
[42:24] revealing to his people that the pillar
[42:26] of fire would be in that camp right and
[42:28] uh you know someone mentioned a few
[42:30] weeks ago what's the difference between
[42:33] message believers
[42:34] and
[42:35] other churches what's the difference the
[42:37] difference is god is revealing his word
[42:41] we know what the mystery is his word is
[42:43] being made manifest amen right
[42:46] and then uh
[42:48] just
[42:49] move you know god showed that as balaam
[42:52] tried to manipulate god
[42:55] god
[42:56] god showed that he was created by amen
[42:58] manipulating bible right
[43:00] and he ended up showing that was dumber
[43:02] than that
[43:04] yeah
[43:14] uh and then
[43:16] just moving on
[43:17] to the next little next little economy
[43:20] that i want to talk about
[43:21] is solomon's temple how you know
[43:25] before uh the first king king saw that
[43:28] the israelites
[43:30] they they were led by the spirit of god
[43:33] right through judges right that uh over
[43:36] a period of time the israelites kind of
[43:38] wane in their faith and god would send
[43:40] another judge to rescue them and bring
[43:42] them back to the faith but then they
[43:44] wanted a king so god raised up king saul
[43:47] and then
[43:48] uh
[43:49] and then king david after him who really
[43:51] unified all of israel around the world
[43:54] and began to accumulate treasures from
[43:56] all over the all over the land and
[43:58] traders and building materials from all
[44:00] around the world from tyre and
[44:01] phoenician from canaan and building
[44:04] blocks and stones and he began
[44:06] and he got everything ready so that when
[44:08] solomon his son became into his king
[44:11] kingdom that he would be able to build a
[44:13] temple right
[44:15] and he built it
[44:16] blah blah blah
[44:19] stoned by stone without one hammer
[44:22] sound without one noise
[44:24] and everything was just perfectly cut
[44:26] beforehand so that when it was brought
[44:28] to the building site it could be placed
[44:30] positionally placed according just just
[44:34] right now picture this building this
[44:36] building is all finished but when it's
[44:38] all finished it doesn't do any good
[44:40] unless it's a unless there's somebody in
[44:43] there right right so that on the day of
[44:45] the dedication
[44:47] all of these little building blocks have
[44:48] been brought from all around the world
[44:50] and brought into this great temple and
[44:53] solomon praised that prayer lord that
[44:55] you've come and lived here and that if
[44:57] anyone is in trouble anywhere in the
[44:59] world and turn their face and that you
[45:02] hear that prayer because they they're
[45:03] looking to your word to the center of
[45:06] their economy right
[45:07] to your economy to your to your to to
[45:10] where your word is right
[45:12] i remember jonah prayed that prayer when
[45:14] he was in the belly of the well he you
[45:15] know how would he know which way the
[45:17] temple was he was looking by faith right
[45:19] to that holy of holies
[45:21] god delivered him and so
[45:24] that temple
[45:26] that temple is a type of the church
[45:28] because
[45:31] each of those stones we talk about uh
[45:34] you know how they rejected the
[45:36] cornerstone
[45:37] but what about the other stones how we
[45:39] can look at our brothers and sisters
[45:40] they say well that it's not gonna make a
[45:42] good place in the building that's
[45:44] that'll never fit right but you know let
[45:46] god uh chisel away it and hold it into
[45:49] his image and place it
[45:51] right and it'll end up being just fit
[45:53] perfectly right in line with with
[45:55] everything else and every stone has a
[45:57] place and every stone has a purpose in
[45:59] the building right now
[46:00] you know zerubbabel said uh zaruga was a
[46:03] steward it was sent back to uh
[46:06] to
[46:06] went back to israel to begin building on
[46:08] the temple
[46:09] and without god working in on the scene
[46:13] durable would never have been able to
[46:15] return back to jerusalem you know they
[46:17] say that uh god started revolts and
[46:20] darius's empire on the other side so
[46:23] that these the israelites could return
[46:25] back and begin building this temple and
[46:27] even when it when they got back you know
[46:29] they had all this problems and turmoil
[46:31] but but god was with him to help them
[46:34] build the temple
[46:36] and he said
[46:37] then he answered in zechariah 4 6 then
[46:39] he answered and speaking to me saying
[46:41] this is the word of the lord and this
[46:42] root will sing not by might nor by power
[46:45] but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts
[46:48] who art the old great mountain before
[46:50] the river thou shalt become a plain
[46:52] great mountain a
[46:54] great mountain that the devil rose up
[46:56] and slits cut down by the sword of god's
[46:58] word
[47:00] to make to be made flat and he shall
[47:02] bring forth a hit stone thereof with
[47:04] shouting he's crying erase grace
[47:06] under it god's building up a church and
[47:09] now let's uh
[47:13] look next to john
[47:15] chapter 3.
[47:18] i've been sitting on john a lot lately
[47:22] and uh there's some good things here
[47:26] and john chapter three i think right
[47:28] here is that
[47:31] how god is building up his church
[47:38] his body
[47:40] john chapter 3
[47:42] there was a man of the pharisees
[47:45] named nicodemus a ruler of the jews
[47:50] the same came to jesus by night and you
[47:52] know he got a reputation from that yeah
[47:55] every other time in scripture that he's
[47:56] referred to it says nicodemus who came
[47:59] to jesus by night yeah but you know he
[48:01] was there
[48:02] when defending him in the to the
[48:05] sanhedrin and he he uh was there with
[48:08] joseph of era mathea to bring murran
[48:10] alone when
[48:12] jesus's death
[48:14] he was there
[48:15] and said unto him
[48:17] rabbi
[48:18] we know that thou art a teacher
[48:20] come from god
[48:22] for no man can do these miracles that
[48:24] thou doest
[48:25] except god be with him
[48:28] now i want to just look at this for a
[48:29] second because if you look at all the
[48:33] different economies that we looked at at
[48:34] lucifer with his his it looked so
[48:38] beautiful and he was so holy and so
[48:40] close to god
[48:41] how are we to discern what is right what
[48:44] is right and what is true
[48:46] nicodemus have correct discernment as he
[48:48] was approaching jesus
[48:49] we know that you're correct because
[48:52] there are many miracles done by you
[48:54] right
[48:56] now
[48:57] remember that in the old testament when
[48:59] when moses began when the plagues began
[49:01] to fall on moses the first plague was
[49:04] the water turned into blood and they
[49:05] were able to duplicate that
[49:07] by their their little uh their little
[49:09] magic tricks and things
[49:11] and then
[49:12] the next the frogs came out of the out
[49:14] of the river and they were able to
[49:16] duplicate that right they were able to
[49:17] copy that but they couldn't copy when
[49:20] the gnats came in to be
[49:22] smaller than that
[49:23] god god can create life but the devil
[49:26] can never bring something to life
[49:27] sometimes something that's dead and
[49:29] worthless he can't bring it right amen
[49:33] to life
[49:36] so nicodemus is coming to jesus and
[49:38] saying no man can do these miracles
[49:41] and you know in second corinthians 11 13
[49:43] 14 it says for such are false apostles
[49:45] deceitful workers
[49:47] transforming themselves into the
[49:49] apostles of christ
[49:51] and no marvel for satan himself is
[49:53] transformed into an angel of life yeah
[49:55] the second thessalonians to god it says
[49:57] even him who's coming is after the
[49:58] working of satan with all power and
[50:01] signs and lying wonders
[50:03] so is that a good test doing wonders and
[50:05] doing signs and
[50:07] and healing even in different places
[50:10] people are the the lame were made to
[50:13] walk and and different things the bills
[50:15] were uh people confessed that they were
[50:17] healed because you know when they heard
[50:19] a beatles song so how do you know
[50:22] in isaiah 8 20 it says
[50:25] to the law and to the testimony if they
[50:27] speak not according to this word it is
[50:30] because there is no light in here
[50:32] that's the comparison
[50:34] nicodemus didn't have the sermon at that
[50:36] time
[50:37] now jesus answered and said unto him
[50:40] verily verily i say unto thee except the
[50:42] man be born again he cannot see the
[50:44] kingdom of god
[50:46] he can't understand it he doesn't know
[50:48] what's going on
[50:49] he doesn't know this mystery of how god
[50:51] is invading himself he doesn't know how
[50:53] to get into the kingdom
[50:54] nicodemus sailing to him how can a man
[50:56] be born when he is old
[50:58] can he enter the second time into his
[51:00] mother's womb and be born
[51:03] jesus says verily verily i say unto me
[51:05] except a man be born of water
[51:07] and of the spirit he cannot enter into
[51:10] the kingdom of god
[51:11] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[51:14] and that which is born of the spirit of
[51:15] spirit
[51:18] now
[51:19] before we go into this a little deeper
[51:21] it's just beautiful how the
[51:23] contradiction between what nicodemus
[51:25] says and then what jesus is right and
[51:27] nicodemus verse two he says we know in
[51:29] jesus verse 11 he says that which we
[51:31] know
[51:32] we speak right then nicodemus verse two
[51:34] he says thou art a teacher and in in
[51:36] verse 10 jesus says ark now a teacher
[51:39] then verse three jesus said except god
[51:42] be with him and nicodemus and said and
[51:44] where forces accept the man be
[51:46] the nickname in verse four says how
[51:49] could a man be born right and christ
[51:51] says except a man be born right now
[51:53] nicodemus didn't even understand the
[51:55] concept of being born again but now
[51:57] jesus laid out the whole right here
[52:00] except the man be born
[52:01] of water and holy spirit he cannot enter
[52:04] into the kingdom of god that's how we
[52:06] get in
[52:07] and that's how we move up right by water
[52:10] and my spirit right
[52:12] so what is the water
[52:15] now i remember i'm talking about an
[52:17] economy considered on god's word right
[52:19] and the economy moves us it places us
[52:22] the economy puts everything in the
[52:23] church in the right order it puts
[52:25] everything in our lives in the right
[52:26] order and it's placing everything
[52:30] the watching
[52:32] of the water of the word that's what it
[52:34] is right now
[52:36] i i didn't have this in my notes but go
[52:38] back to chapter two
[52:40] how the very first miracle that jesus
[52:42] does is to turn the water into the wine
[52:44] but look how he does it he says there's
[52:47] some empty vessels over there first
[52:49] you've got to be cleansed and
[52:51] those vessels have been purified
[52:53] by uh let's see how it says that after
[52:55] the manner of the purifying of the jews
[52:57] right contained two or three frequents
[52:59] apiece and these water pots have been
[53:01] set aside and then jesus said fill the
[53:03] water pots with water
[53:05] first you gotta be filled with the word
[53:08] filled and washed by the washing of the
[53:10] water
[53:11] and they fill them up to the brim and he
[53:13] saith unto them draw out now and bear
[53:15] unto the governor of the feasts and they
[53:17] bear it now here's another example of
[53:19] where it looks like
[53:21] jesus is not doing the work but the
[53:23] servants were the ones that were drawing
[53:25] out the water the servants were the ones
[53:27] that took the walk the wine and took it
[53:29] to the to the the people at the feast
[53:32] but it was jesus behind the scenes
[53:36] and you know maybe you look at this
[53:38] little scene right here and think
[53:40] nothing's going on but god is doing
[53:42] something
[53:43] man
[53:45] that's right
[53:47] brothers go ahead and put that quote up
[53:48] the you must be born again 1961 to uh
[53:52] paragraph two of seven now remember
[54:01] now remember i believe that jesus christ
[54:03] says this to every human being on his
[54:05] first doctrine
[54:06] except the man be born of the water
[54:08] that's the word
[54:10] washing of the water by the word and of
[54:12] the spirit which is the holy spirit the
[54:14] holy spirit confirming the word he
[54:16] cannot see the kingdom of heaven right
[54:18] now do you believe that sea of the water
[54:20] washing of the water by the word word
[54:22] and truth he is the truth
[54:25] water and spirit the spirit coming with
[54:27] the word to confirm the word making god
[54:29] live in me
[54:31] see we cannot understand the kingdom of
[54:32] heaven till that's happened right then
[54:34] when that begins to happen that we see
[54:36] the word in us born of the word of the
[54:39] spirit manifesting itself leading me not
[54:42] away from the word the spirit leads me
[54:44] to the word and the word living in me
[54:46] making god manifest in your life you'll
[54:49] never understand the kingdom of god and
[54:51] can no lies enter into it god bless you
[54:54] now there's the whole plan the whole the
[54:57] god expressing itself and how is he
[54:59] expressing himself by building block on
[55:02] top of block word on top of the word and
[55:04] then his spirit coming to make it alive
[55:06] so you gotta eat keep reading and eating
[55:10] until his word is made manifest in him
[55:12] and then you see virtue and then you see
[55:15] temperance and patience in your life
[55:17] manifesting you by the watching the
[55:19] water of the word right like sister
[55:21] shepard's dream that
[55:23] the the word just
[55:25] bubbling up and watching out everything
[55:28] from the inside all the all the
[55:30] the antichrist
[55:32] all of the
[55:33] stuff that don't conform with his word
[55:36] it's pushing it all out
[55:40] and uh in john
[55:43] chapter 7 verse 37 jesus said in the
[55:46] last day that great day of the feast
[55:48] jesus stood and cried now am i imagine
[55:51] seeing that the day of the feast and
[55:53] then somebody in the back stands up and
[55:55] cries out with a message
[55:58] jesus stood and cried saying
[56:00] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[56:03] and drink amen he that believeth on me
[56:05] is the scripture i said out of his belly
[56:07] shall flow rivers
[56:09] of living water amen you begin as the
[56:12] water just gushes up within you you
[56:13] begin everything everything falls into
[56:16] place right you don't you don't wonder
[56:18] about things so much right everything
[56:20] begins to become alive
[56:24] paul said i have begotten you through
[56:27] the gospels
[56:30] james 1 18 says of his own will beget
[56:33] all his own will beget yes with the word
[56:35] of truth that we should be a kind of
[56:37] first fruits of these creatures in first
[56:39] peter 2 1 23 says
[56:41] being born again
[56:43] not a corruptible seed but of
[56:44] incorruptible by the word of god which
[56:47] liveth and abideth forever
[56:50] then
[56:51] now we've got to keep reading the story
[56:53] the wind blows where it listed right and
[56:56] now here is the sound thereof that can't
[56:58] not tell where's it cometh and whether
[57:00] it goes right so is everyone that is
[57:03] born of the spirit amen that's a very
[57:05] mysterious scripture
[57:07] how how is the wind like somebody that's
[57:10] born of the spirit first of all you go
[57:12] out on a windy day and you stand there
[57:14] and you say i'm gonna stop the wind
[57:16] put your hand up and say stop right you
[57:18] can't stop it it's an immovable force
[57:21] right the wind is sovereign it's beyond
[57:24] your control right you get out there and
[57:26] say there's a tornado that's coming by
[57:28] and say stop tornado and get yourself in
[57:32] the way you're gonna get hurt real bad
[57:34] and you know the wind is irresistible
[57:37] like a tornado that comes through and it
[57:39] tears down everything in its path right
[57:42] you let the wind of god come in your
[57:43] life in the holy spirit it'll start
[57:45] tearing out all your prejudices and all
[57:47] the all the unbelief in your life and
[57:50] all your uh
[57:52] unloved for your brothers and sisters
[57:54] that tears down all your rebellion and
[57:56] all your opposition all the antichrist
[57:59] doctrines and things in your life
[58:02] it's an invisible
[58:05] force that moves it you know you look
[58:07] out in this building and see all the
[58:09] faces but behind the scenes god is
[58:11] moving just like when he was instructing
[58:14] the servants to pour the water and to
[58:17] scoop out the wine right they had to
[58:19] serve it right it's something moving
[58:21] behind the scenes
[58:22] and
[58:27] and it's
[58:29] invigorating
[58:30] right because it brings life right
[58:33] loretta
[58:36] so moving on
[58:38] we've got a rushing mighty wind
[58:41] that was experienced on the day of
[58:43] pentecost
[58:44] they were all in the upper room now
[58:45] remember picture this they were all in
[58:47] the upper room around and a little
[58:49] economy around god's word because god
[58:51] had told him to go right with terry
[58:53] until you're ready with power from ohio
[58:55] and now as he tells it one of them might
[58:57] have rose up and said well we've already
[59:00] got it and then peter maybe stood up and
[59:02] said hold on now he told us to wait
[59:05] let's move the center of our economy
[59:08] back to his word right they tried to get
[59:10] it off he moved it back right hold on
[59:13] now and then a rushing mighty wind that
[59:15] invigorated him and filled in with the
[59:17] power of god
[59:18] and you know they ended up out on the
[59:20] street now who let them out on the
[59:22] street right i don't think anybody said
[59:23] well i think we should leave now and go
[59:25] out on the street you know they the door
[59:28] opened up and they staggered out and
[59:29] before long they found they were on the
[59:31] street and god was speaking out from
[59:33] inside of them
[59:35] and you know i don't believe that peter
[59:37] really understood before he was in need
[59:39] for power on high how to get into the
[59:42] kingdom right but after that happened he
[59:44] went down the street he said i'll tell
[59:46] you how to get in repeat and be baptized
[59:48] in the name of jesus christ
[59:51] and he gave him the word and they
[59:53] received it and the spirit quickened it
[59:56] and they were filled with the power of
[59:57] god
[59:58] and baptized into the body
[1:00:01] and you know god put in the church and
[1:00:03] economy they began moving and ordering
[1:00:06] things he put a five-fold ministry and
[1:00:08] they put ministries into the church you
[1:00:10] know just because i'm
[1:00:12] just because you're not up here it
[1:00:13] doesn't have you know brother talked
[1:00:15] about uh
[1:00:17] uh how there might be somebody in the
[1:00:19] church that's praying and fasting right
[1:00:21] for somebody over here to catch the
[1:00:23] endeavor right now everybody has
[1:00:24] something to do i think i think a lot of
[1:00:27] times the things that are unseen are
[1:00:28] greater than the things that are seen
[1:00:31] you know
[1:00:33] we don't see the ones in here that are
[1:00:35] praying and fasting at night praying on
[1:00:38] saturday night for a good church service
[1:00:40] or praying for one another that god
[1:00:42] would uh heal one another and minister
[1:00:45] to one another but we don't maybe a lot
[1:00:47] of times he doesn't see that but god
[1:00:48] sees it man that's who we're doing it
[1:00:50] for we're uh
[1:00:52] we're doing it for him you know the
[1:00:53] bible says myself
[1:01:00] and uh you know that baptism in the holy
[1:01:03] ghost that economy got a hold of a
[1:01:05] little man named paul who his economy he
[1:01:08] thought he was going in the right
[1:01:09] direction he had his economy over here
[1:01:11] on uh well we need to kill these people
[1:01:14] because they're not believing and one
[1:01:15] day he met the pillar of fire and god
[1:01:17] shifted his center of his economy onto
[1:01:19] the word onto the right way right and
[1:01:22] the things that paul thought were true
[1:01:24] uh he realized that he was going in the
[1:01:26] wrong direction it turned into 180
[1:01:28] degrees around
[1:01:29] you know what the first thing paul did
[1:01:31] was he started looking in the word and
[1:01:33] he went into the wilderness for three
[1:01:35] years and the word reflected back on him
[1:01:38] and it just the the word and the spirit
[1:01:40] world type of word spirit clicking in it
[1:01:42] and making it alive to him and by the
[1:01:44] time he came out of that wilderness he
[1:01:46] was ready to go and he spent two weeks
[1:01:47] at peter's house making sure that he was
[1:01:49] on the right track right the way he went
[1:01:51] right
[1:01:52] because paul had he had become part of
[1:01:55] this economy centered on god's word
[1:01:59] and you know i was i was reading about
[1:02:00] how brother branham's talked about how
[1:02:03] that
[1:02:04] your your your whole salvation god had
[1:02:07] pre-planned it and ordained it and and
[1:02:11] just planned everything out he planned
[1:02:13] it for paul to meet that pillar fire
[1:02:14] because he knew he would receive it he
[1:02:16] planned for you to be here today because
[1:02:18] you knew you'd receive it right right
[1:02:20] and uh he ordered paul's sentences
[1:02:24] around his word and that's what he does
[1:02:26] to us when we're filled with the holy
[1:02:27] ghost
[1:02:28] you start looking at things differently
[1:02:30] right but first you know abraham got
[1:02:32] just a little bit of taste in that
[1:02:34] spirit and he started ignoring his
[1:02:36] eyesight now i don't even care what i
[1:02:39] see anymore because i know one day i'm
[1:02:41] gonna be holding a little baby
[1:02:43] and uh
[1:02:44] you know paul started ignoring his
[1:02:46] reason right by his own reason and by
[1:02:49] his imagination he can look in the word
[1:02:51] and say well i i'm right i should be
[1:02:53] killing these people because they're not
[1:02:54] believing what the old testament prophet
[1:02:56] said but when he got when that economy
[1:02:59] of god got into him he
[1:03:02] it it moved it moved his senses just
[1:03:06] like
[1:03:06] that
[1:03:07] solar shift the sun
[1:03:09] moved jupiter to planets around an orbit
[1:03:12] around the sun
[1:03:14] you remember one day joshua he was
[1:03:16] fighting the battle and
[1:03:18] he was fighting battle with the king of
[1:03:20] jabez which jesus was the name of
[1:03:22] jerusalem before it became jerusalem and
[1:03:24] uh he he needed a little bit more time
[1:03:27] and the word of god inside of him just
[1:03:30] spoke out and he said uh he said son you
[1:03:33] ain't still having a good bed and moving
[1:03:34] your hands to state to stay still over
[1:03:36] agilent because i need a little bit more
[1:03:38] time
[1:03:40] everything stood still
[1:03:42] for a whole day because god's word has
[1:03:44] spoken out from within when god's word
[1:03:46] moves your senses it'll put everything
[1:03:48] just in line perfectly around his word
[1:03:51] maybe not all at once but as the washing
[1:03:53] of the water word moves up and moves up
[1:03:56] things begin to fall
[1:04:08] you know
[1:04:08] uh
[1:04:10] i'll wrap up in just a minute here but
[1:04:12] god uh he he he you know bro brown
[1:04:15] preached his sermon or the series of
[1:04:17] sermons conduct order and doctrine right
[1:04:19] now conduct order and doctrine built
[1:04:21] around
[1:04:22] uh positioning us and moving us placing
[1:04:31] he moves us he places his people he
[1:04:33] places his church he places your senses
[1:04:36] everything around the economy of his
[1:04:38] word and then the last the last thing i
[1:04:40] want to talk about is just moving right
[1:04:42] on down
[1:04:43] is your family
[1:04:45] because if you don't have god in your
[1:04:46] home and i talked about this a little
[1:04:48] bit at the valentine's day banquet but
[1:04:50] if you don't have got it in your home
[1:04:52] then things will not be placed right
[1:04:53] right and i'm not gonna meddle or
[1:04:55] anything but
[1:04:56] but uh god in your home you know take
[1:04:59] time
[1:05:00] to
[1:05:01] pray with your family
[1:05:03] and put god first
[1:05:05] because you know the devil will try you
[1:05:08] know all these little stories we told
[1:05:09] about how the devil would try to move
[1:05:12] your center the center of your economy
[1:05:14] yeah from off of god's word on something
[1:05:17] else
[1:05:18] he tried to do that with the children of
[1:05:20] israel by moving it off of the
[1:05:22] god's word manifested into stones he
[1:05:24] moved it onto the golden calf and moved
[1:05:27] it from god's word with eve
[1:05:30] waiting on god's word he moved it to
[1:05:32] the the word of the beast
[1:05:34] and he'll move your focus in your home
[1:05:37] if you if you don't watch out
[1:05:39] you'll move it with this layout of
[1:05:41] spirit let's see in spirit moving in and
[1:05:43] encroaching and trying to get things out
[1:05:46] of balance trying to get you off the
[1:05:48] center the his word is a sinner his word
[1:05:51] and we don't have that in our in that in
[1:05:53] our home it'll just be like solomon's
[1:05:55] temple without an anointing right it'll
[1:05:57] be uh we'll just be beating our heads
[1:05:59] against the wall like the scripture says
[1:06:02] then joshua 24 14-16 it says now
[1:06:04] therefore fear the lord
[1:06:06] and serve him in its sincerity and in
[1:06:08] truth
[1:06:09] and put away the gods which your father
[1:06:11] served on the other side of flood and in
[1:06:12] egypt and serve you the lord and if it
[1:06:15] seemed evil unto you to serve the lord
[1:06:17] choose you this day whom you will serve
[1:06:19] whether the god was your father sir they
[1:06:21] were on the other side of the flood of
[1:06:23] the gods of the amorites and whose land
[1:06:25] you dwell
[1:06:26] but as for me in my house we will serve
[1:06:28] the lord all right
[1:06:29] and the people answered and said god
[1:06:32] forbid that we should forsake the lord
[1:06:34] to serve other gods
[1:06:36] now i i just want to finish up
[1:06:39] brothers if you go ahead and put up that
[1:06:40] first quarter way to jesus
[1:06:43] 1963
[1:06:45] wrap it all up by going back to that
[1:06:47] wheel in the middle of the wheel yeah
[1:06:50] program 225
[1:06:53] nebuchadnezzar threw three hebrew
[1:06:55] children in the fire furnace that
[1:06:56] believed in god and stood on his word
[1:06:58] if they had to die for it was going to
[1:07:00] stand anyhow just a little thing of
[1:07:02] bowing their knees some other way but
[1:07:04] when he looked away and saw jesus he was
[1:07:05] the fourth man that was in the fiery
[1:07:07] furnace and it kept all the heat off of
[1:07:09] his obedient servant
[1:07:11] that's what nebuchadnezzar saw right
[1:07:13] ezekiel looked away to see him one day
[1:07:15] and he was a wheel in the middle of the
[1:07:16] wheel way up in the middle of the air he
[1:07:19] was the hub to the wheel whatever he
[1:07:21] spoke is fascinating
[1:07:22] amen the big will run by faith but the
[1:07:25] little will turn by the power of the
[1:07:27] lord that's who ezekiel saw when he
[1:07:29] looked away
[1:07:31] let's go to the next one verse our
[1:07:33] paragraph 62.

[1:07:39] kanaz will one day have done an evil
[1:07:41] thing he threw three believing children
[1:07:43] into the fire first
[1:07:45] and when he opened the door to see how
[1:07:47] they were getting along in there
[1:07:48] he saw the fourth man on the inside of
[1:07:50] the face
[1:07:52] and what did you see when you look at
[1:07:53] nebuchadnezzar he said he looked like
[1:07:55] the son of god that's what he saw when
[1:07:56] he when he looked into a crime that he
[1:07:58] had done that was one that looked like
[1:08:00] son of god ezekiel took a look one day
[1:08:02] he said i saw him too and he was a wheel
[1:08:04] in the middle of the wheel turning up in
[1:08:06] the middle of the air right that's what
[1:08:07] he looked like to ezekiel and the last
