[5:05] cenart
[5:08] sister well they know who I'm talking
[5:10] about
[5:11] but we had we had a baptismal service so
[5:13] sister Sharon cenart was baptized
[5:15] yesterday
[5:16] out here
[5:18] and um
[5:19] she had told me and most of you know the
[5:22] story she told me a couple years ago
[5:23] even that she wanted to be baptized and
[5:25] then about a year ago man it really
[5:27] looked bad she I mean they sent her home
[5:29] to die if you'll know the the
[5:30] testimonial you'll hear from
[5:33] sister Ashton Brother Joseph
[5:36] that they give her up to die they just
[5:38] sent her own home and we just really I
[5:40] mean we were praying hard
[5:42] and the Lord brought her out of it and I
[5:45] mean brought her from a being bedridden
[5:47] with a catheter being immobile
[5:51] till we walked her right out here
[5:54] had to help her in but that's okay
[5:58] and we baptized in the name of the Lord
[6:00] Jesus Christ so God gave her an
[6:02] opportunity
[6:04] and I'm telling you folks don't miss
[6:07] yours
[6:08] don't miss yours but see God in your
[6:11] heart
[6:12] got in your heart so he made her body
[6:14] and that's what we're going to get into
[6:15] a little bit later he made her body obey
[6:17] what she wanted
[6:20] she was dying
[6:22] she was going to die
[6:24] I told her yesterday I said you're the
[6:26] best looking dead person I ever seen
[6:29] she just laughed
[6:31] also I was sitting home as I told
[6:33] Brother Joseph was sitting home last
[6:34] night and phone rang and it was a
[6:36] strange number and I looked at it and it
[6:38] said it said FaceTime
[6:42] so I clicked it it was Sharon
[6:45] I said what are you doing who's with you
[6:47] nobody
[6:48] I said you're doing this all by yourself
[6:50] uh-huh I said will you facing time me
[6:52] anytime you want to so y'all had trained
[6:54] her I guess how to use Esther's like I
[6:56] don't have a clue but but she was really
[6:59] tired she was in the bed but she was
[7:00] thinking Thanking us all for praying for
[7:02] her and for us being able to I told her
[7:05] it was an honor to baptize her it's not
[7:07] the other way around it's an honor for
[7:08] me to baptize people I just really
[7:11] um really enjoy it so just keep the keep
[7:13] her in your prayer as the Lord will
[7:15] continue he left her here for some
[7:17] reason
[7:18] so let's take that reason I told her
[7:20] yesterday I said look this is your day
[7:22] of visitation God's visited you you
[7:24] wanted this this was your desire so now
[7:26] go forward now let's do something all
[7:29] right and she's still you know got the
[7:31] stroke but but she can still
[7:33] she's got her mind she she knows what
[7:35] she's saying so so you know what God can
[7:38] deal with that
[7:40] amen
[7:41] God can deal with that so we're going to
[7:42] pray for him also uh brother Paul
[7:45] Thompson just sent me a message and his
[7:47] daughter Amber has coveted so remember
[7:49] her in prayer we got several that have
[7:51] covered I'm not worried about it you
[7:54] know it's just a Cletus 90 something
[7:55] years old and she can make it so can we
[7:58] Yeah man so we're just gonna keep her in
[8:01] prayer but and I know all of us have
[8:03] somebody we know that has coveted and um
[8:06] or or is sick
[8:08] and uh we really won't need to pray need
[8:10] to need to uh ask the Lord to intervene
[8:13] in all these situations so let's bow our
[8:15] head
[8:16] dear Lord thank you for this day that
[8:17] you give us
[8:19] we pray now Lord that you would
[8:21] help us just for uh
[8:23] small moment of time to get out of the
[8:25] way Lord and
[8:26] you speak your mind to the people Lord
[8:29] let it not be my thoughts but be yours
[8:31] Lord
[8:33] we pray Lord it should be with the ones
[8:35] that are not here the ones that are sick
[8:37] I know several watching online different
[8:39] ones Lord that are not feeling well
[8:42] different situations Lord I pray we
[8:44] should minister to each one father
[8:47] Lord we've come to a time that is
[8:48] getting closer to the end and
[8:51] we see things going on in the world
[8:54] but Lord you always said that there was
[8:57] a Goshen
[8:58] there was a place that the children of
[9:00] Israel could go to and they would be
[9:02] safe
[9:03] well father today your word is the only
[9:05] safe thing there is
[9:07] and Lord I pray in the name of the Lord
[9:09] Jesus that you would just be with us now
[9:11] as a congregation
[9:12] forgive us of our sins and our many
[9:14] mistakes that we make the Lord clear us
[9:16] out sanctify us be with us for the rest
[9:19] of this journey Lord just be with the
[9:20] ones that are traveling brother Louise
[9:22] Minister and their brother Williams and
[9:24] also brother Aaron and brother Andre
[9:26] heads Lord we pray that you just give
[9:28] them the words to speak to the people
[9:29] and may they get something Lord from the
[9:32] ministering father thank you for the
[9:34] ministry here thank you for the words
[9:36] that we hear Lord all the time the music
[9:38] musicians the singers all the song
[9:41] leaders all deacons elders and anyone
[9:44] that sits in a Pew today Lord we pray
[9:46] that you would energize us Lord that you
[9:48] would give us strength for this journey
[9:49] Lord in Jesus name we pray amen it's
[9:52] been a long one been a long journey
[9:54] listen to this quote I found yesterday
[9:57] thirsting for Life 1960 the prophet of
[10:00] God said if men and women love God as
[10:02] much as they the world
[10:05] loves their pleasures
[10:07] the pleasure of a Christian is serving
[10:10] the lord at the house of God
[10:15] we still am I in the right congregation
[10:17] we still believe brother Brown okay all
[10:20] right
[10:21] the pleasure of a Christian is serving
[10:23] the lord at the house of God you don't
[10:25] have to sign no cards
[10:28] you can't open the door quick enough
[10:31] and if the members of the church love
[10:33] one another enough instead of putting
[10:35] little clicks and pulling away from the
[10:36] church
[10:37] brother if you love one another so much
[10:39] that you hurt your heart till you get
[10:41] together again that's the way it should
[10:43] be blessed be the tie that binds our
[10:46] heart and Christian Love The Fellowship
[10:47] of Kindred Minds is light to that above
[10:49] well we Ascend when we when we as under
[10:53] part it gives us inward pain does it
[10:56] I don't want to say him again but we
[10:58] shall still be joined in heart and hope
[11:00] to meet again oh god look watch this if
[11:03] we have to take every miracle
[11:06] out of the church
[11:10] wow if we have to take every Miracle out
[11:14] of the church if we have to take all the
[11:17] pipe organs out
[11:18] and the plush pews
[11:21] and give us back that Godly love
[11:23] Brotherly Love among the people and
[11:25] fellowship if we have to do all that
[11:27] take it back to that again
[11:30] wow what a quote
[11:33] what a quote 1960 Thurston
[11:35] for God John 1 1 says in the beginning
[11:38] was the word words with God and the Word
[11:40] was God
[11:41] verse 14 said the word was made flesh
[11:43] and dwelt among us we beheld his glory
[11:45] the glory of the only begotten of the
[11:47] father full of grace and truth he may be
[11:49] seated
[11:50] Lord add his Blessing to the reading the
[11:52] word this is part 53 on son of man it's
[11:55] it's
[11:56] um it's heading we're heading towards
[11:58] something I hope everybody sees that we
[12:00] it may take us 40 years but it somewhere
[12:03] we're going to get to the promised land
[12:04] amen it may take us a while it took us
[12:07] almost 40 weeks anyway so
[12:09] part number 50 something so let's go to
[12:13] first Thessalonians
[12:14] but today I want a background just for a
[12:16] few minutes
[12:17] um
[12:20] brother Daniel Perry and his wife's on
[12:21] their way here so I don't know if they
[12:23] got here already or not but just pray
[12:25] for them they come to uh they come to uh
[12:28] honor the anniversary of the
[12:31] of mom and dad so they're they're on the
[12:33] way furthermore then we beseech you
[12:35] brother and exhort you by the Lord Jesus
[12:37] that as you have received of us how you
[12:39] ought to walk and please God look so you
[12:42] would abound more and more so what we're
[12:44] preaching today what we've been trying
[12:46] to get people to see is is that there's
[12:49] more to God
[12:50] there's more to God than just raising
[12:52] your hand and say God I'm sorry or
[12:53] there's more than water baptism
[12:56] and there's more than coming to church
[12:58] it's it's it's it's it's all together
[13:00] the reason I read that quote is brother
[13:02] Brown says that desire in your heart to
[13:03] go not because if you don't show up I'm
[13:05] gonna write your name down and put it on
[13:07] a wall and says absent
[13:10] no you know what God's going to do that
[13:12] you know I'm gonna answer to me you're
[13:13] gonna answer to God
[13:15] I don't know why people don't see that
[13:17] uh well I just don't like you well I
[13:19] don't care you must not like God either
[13:21] for you know what Commandments we give
[13:24] you by the Lord Jesus for this is the
[13:26] will of God even your sanctification so
[13:29] God doesn't want you just to get born
[13:31] again he wants to continue he wants to
[13:33] make you and sanctify you and Die daily
[13:35] that's what we're going to look at a
[13:37] little bit maybe this afternoon with a
[13:38] tabernacle because the second see we
[13:41] looked at the first stage and I don't
[13:43] have it up there but we see the first
[13:44] stages baby form justification baby form
[13:47] sanctification baby form baptism of the
[13:50] Holy Ghost if you might say that is the
[13:51] birth of the child everybody with me all
[13:54] right and it's not so much different but
[13:56] it is different because you don't have
[13:58] to you don't have to ask forgiveness of
[14:00] the sin you did that you asked
[14:01] forgiveness for yesterday if you really
[14:03] got if you're sincere and God forgive
[14:05] you
[14:06] we waste a lot of our time going God I'm
[14:08] sorry for doing if it's already put in
[14:11] the sea of God forgetfulness like I said
[14:13] before put the no fishing sign up don't
[14:15] go back there anymore
[14:17] because God can't go back past that sign
[14:21] he said he's good
[14:22] amen
[14:24] so let's move on with god well I've got
[14:26] this if it's back there leave it
[14:29] that was the problem with the children
[14:31] of Israel that's why God had to let it
[14:33] go 40 years so all those old people old
[14:37] Fighters had to die out because they
[14:39] kept going every time some little
[14:40] situation would happen
[14:43] their cat would get sick
[14:47] they say oh it'd be better back in Egypt
[14:50] right oh we'd be better back eating
[14:53] leeks and garlic instead of this
[14:55] bread that was free
[14:58] that had every nutrient that you needed
[15:00] and they didn't want that no more
[15:02] it's the same way with us
[15:04] are we going forward
[15:06] because I believe Joshua and Caleb was
[15:08] they were pulling those people come on
[15:10] we got to go and Caleb stands up and
[15:12] says
[15:13] I'm more than able now to have that
[15:15] mountain I'm 80 now I was 40 when I
[15:17] started but I'm 80 now and you know what
[15:20] he did he did exactly what he said he
[15:22] took that mountain
[15:24] so God will what honor your request
[15:28] for this is the will of God even your
[15:29] sanctification that issues says excuse
[15:32] me you should abstain from fornication
[15:34] look that every one of you should know
[15:37] how to possess his possess his vessel in
[15:40] sanctification and honor I was thinking
[15:41] about yesterday you know when we talk
[15:43] about possession now each one of us
[15:46] we're possessed with something
[15:49] right don't get quiet we're possessed
[15:52] with something every person in this
[15:54] building
[15:56] all right
[15:57] now you either possess with God or
[15:59] possessed with the devil but even though
[16:01] if you're possessed by one of the two
[16:03] you have to be there's no in between
[16:05] all right then there's other things that
[16:07] are that possess you like I like to hunt
[16:10] all right I like to hunt and and uh
[16:14] brother Michael does not like to hunt
[16:17] so I'm possessed
[16:20] with I like to hunt he's possessed with
[16:23] I like to whatever his is all right and
[16:25] that's human that's human nature but it
[16:27] still is a nature that we have to deal
[16:28] with
[16:29] all right because look it says not in
[16:31] the lust of conscience even as the
[16:33] Gentiles which knew not God they didn't
[16:36] know God they didn't care
[16:37] but you and I do
[16:39] all right so every man possessed his
[16:42] vessel and sanctification and honor
[16:45] it's what we do with what we got
[16:47] all right so we've got the devil what
[16:49] are we going to do with it oh you know
[16:51] what you're going to do you're going to
[16:52] be possessed by that and you're going to
[16:54] do what the devil says then are you
[16:55] going to be possessed by God do what God
[16:58] says do like I said before can't wait
[17:00] till the church's doors get open can't
[17:01] wait to fellowship with people doesn't
[17:03] matter if if I can't say my words right
[17:07] doesn't matter if you can't say your
[17:08] words right
[17:10] doesn't matter if you sit in the back of
[17:12] the front
[17:17] we put a little lists together
[17:19] and we do that and we do it listen we do
[17:22] it unconsciously
[17:24] I don't like this preacher because
[17:29] what you just don't like them if they
[17:31] preach the word of God I really don't
[17:32] care what he looks like or what he
[17:33] sounds like
[17:34] amen
[17:37] how many of you heard brother Dale says
[17:38] even though he's he's listened to error
[17:40] he got something out of it
[17:42] how many of you don't know you'll shut
[17:44] it off buddy and well you shut off and
[17:46] go to sleep anyway so
[17:47] when the word's being preached so when
[17:49] you shut it off I'm not listening to
[17:51] that guy no you might get something you
[17:53] might get a nugget what am I I'm trying
[17:55] to train us as we start up this statue
[17:56] of perfect man I don't want anybody to
[17:58] fall off I want I want to make sure this
[18:01] Foundation of faith
[18:03] and by renewing of your mind as we're
[18:05] reading here and by what by possessing
[18:08] Your Vessel and sanctification and honor
[18:10] oh that's that preacher's fault I'm
[18:11] doing this no
[18:13] right no
[18:15] I'm like
[18:17] uh we were at camp meeting last weekend
[18:18] brother Donnie Reagan preached on chain
[18:20] to a dead man
[18:23] that's what would happen if a ruler
[18:25] would go into the a certain ruler would
[18:26] go into the City and take over the city
[18:28] well he'd kill half the people he'd
[18:31] leave other half alive and just to
[18:33] antagonize them or just to show his
[18:35] authority he would chain you that was
[18:37] alive to one that was dead
[18:40] now could you imagine dragging around a
[18:41] dead body
[18:43] and it starts thinking
[18:47] right
[18:49] but he also used this analogy which is
[18:51] wonderful because Paul was putting
[18:52] chains here was a Roman soldier that was
[18:55] assigned to Paul
[18:57] he was chained to him
[18:59] so Paul says Hey Roman I'm going to
[19:01] church that Roman's like I ain't going
[19:04] back over there
[19:05] you gotta go
[19:10] when Paul lifted his hands to praise God
[19:12] guess what that Roman had to lift his
[19:15] hands whether they wanted to or not
[19:18] and I'm looking at Romans here are you
[19:20] letting your Roman take over you that
[19:22] was the whole point we all have Romans
[19:25] we have Romans we have dead bodies we're
[19:27] dragging around chained to a dead man I
[19:29] enjoyed it it was good but think about
[19:31] that's what you do every day of your
[19:34] life you're chained to something
[19:37] Paul says I'm happy to be in my chains
[19:40] I'm happy to be in my bondage how many
[19:43] of you can say that that you're happy
[19:45] because the Bible is going to tell us in
[19:46] a little bit that the trying of your
[19:48] faith right the trying of your faith not
[19:51] God's faith not your neighbor's Faith
[19:53] your faith
[19:55] be not conformed to this world but be
[19:57] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[19:59] listen we've got to come to a place that
[20:01] we are thinking like bride that we are
[20:04] thinking like the statue of a perfect
[20:06] man that we're thinking like Jesus
[20:09] Christ because we're we're are we going
[20:10] to renew our mind back to the world are
[20:13] we going to renew our mind back to
[20:14] carnality we live in that 90 of the time
[20:17] anyway
[20:21] but to renew your mind is to renew it
[20:24] back to where Jesus Christ can take over
[20:26] where the thoughts of Jesus Christ go
[20:28] into you and that you speak those
[20:30] thoughts
[20:32] be transformed so there's got to be
[20:35] something happens it's not just one day
[20:36] you wake up and you're born again no
[20:39] there's a journey to this that's what
[20:40] we've been on for 40 something sermons
[20:42] there's a journey to this thing there's
[20:45] everywhere you look look Abraham had a
[20:47] journey
[20:50] tight justification sanctification about
[20:52] them all goes 25 years he walked with
[20:55] the promise of God
[20:57] we can't stand 30 minutes of it
[21:02] so we got to renew our mind that you may
[21:04] prove what is that good that you may
[21:05] prove
[21:07] it's back in your lap now you may prove
[21:09] what is that good and acceptable and
[21:12] perfect will of God
[21:16] listen
[21:17] you say I can't do it
[21:20] God said you could
[21:23] and then if God said it he's got to make
[21:25] a way
[21:27] as I've said many times before listen 99
[21:29] troops not going to get a body change
[21:32] it's going to take a hundred well I
[21:34] can't do it because
[21:36] that first thing you said is your
[21:38] problem
[21:39] ah
[21:41] because the Bible says somebody's going
[21:43] to have to come to perfection in a body
[21:46] of Flesh that's dying looking older so
[21:50] we've got to have our mind renewed and
[21:52] it's got to be by the word of God on
[21:55] Sunday on Wednesday listen to tape
[21:56] praying reading your Bible talking to
[21:59] brothers and sisters about God not about
[22:01] each other
[22:09] can't be with somebody five minutes when
[22:10] I'm talking about somebody else
[22:12] for I say to the grace given unto me to
[22:14] every man look there's money you not to
[22:15] think of himself more highly than he
[22:17] ought to think but to think soberly
[22:18] according as God has dealt to every man
[22:21] we've read this many many times but
[22:23] there's a Measure of Faith each one of
[22:24] us has to come to listen God knows God
[22:28] knows we don't but God knows what
[22:30] measure you're going to get to but you
[22:32] don't know and see to me that's the
[22:34] unfolding or the mystery that we all
[22:36] have in our life Abraham did not know
[22:39] when he first said okay Lord I'm going
[22:41] to get up and walk he did not know that
[22:43] it would be 25 years the prophet of God
[22:46] said he just believed he just kept
[22:48] believing and kept believing can't
[22:49] believe him if you would have told him
[22:51] at the beginning
[22:53] Regina it's gonna be 25 years Abraham
[22:56] he's going to go can't do it
[22:59] I'm done to start with
[23:02] no you got
[23:03] you gave when you get gifts then
[23:05] don't worry what the Bible says don't
[23:07] worry about tomorrow
[23:09] take care of itself
[23:11] you worry about today let's get through
[23:13] today
[23:15] the Bible says today is the day of our
[23:17] Salvation not tomorrow the next year 40
[23:18] years down the road
[23:20] I mean have you how many of you older
[23:22] ones brother Colleen Brothers already if
[23:23] you were here today they'd tell you some
[23:25] of the older ones Dad and Mom
[23:27] would it be late 30 years ago we'd be
[23:30] here today
[23:34] they just said no way unbelievable can't
[23:37] happen
[23:38] then you had those people that were way
[23:40] back this in 1977 was going to be it
[23:43] were they at today most of them have
[23:45] passed on
[23:47] but God left it here for a reason we are
[23:50] here for a reason we're not here because
[23:52] God took a nap and forgot to punch the
[23:54] clock
[23:55] for the Rapture no he's been right here
[23:58] with us the whole time what in our
[24:00] journey molding us making us letting us
[24:02] go through trials and tribulations
[24:04] because the trying of our faith How You
[24:06] Gonna know if you got faith if you're
[24:07] not tried
[24:10] oh no I just got faith faith for what
[24:12] faith has got to be the substance of
[24:15] things hoped for something you think
[24:18] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[24:21] for as we have many members in one body
[24:23] and all members have not the same office
[24:26] so we be many are one body in Christ and
[24:28] everyone remembers one of another
[24:31] First Corinthians 13 verse 1 says do I
[24:33] speak with the tongue of men and angels
[24:35] and have not charity I have become a
[24:37] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol
[24:39] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[24:41] understand all Mysteries this is a
[24:43] pretty good guy pretty good message
[24:44] preacher and all knowledge and though I
[24:46] have all Faith so that I can move a
[24:48] mountain
[24:49] and have not charity I am nothing and
[24:52] though I'll bestow all my goods to feed
[24:54] the poor do I give my body to be burned
[24:57] and I'm not charity it profiteth me
[25:00] nothing
[25:01] and that word love there is agape love
[25:04] it is brotherly love it's affection good
[25:06] will love benevolence it's God's love it
[25:09] is not man's love
[25:10] you can only agape love me if you have
[25:13] Agape Love In You
[25:16] you can only agape love me if I have
[25:19] agape love you can't understand what
[25:21] I've been reading the scripture you
[25:22] can't understand Jesus Christ without
[25:23] the Holy Ghost who is Jesus Christ
[25:25] that's a god they love
[25:27] what do you have if you're born again
[25:28] agape love and your soul the problem is
[25:32] is you've got that next realm that's got
[25:36] memory reasoning Consciousness oh one
[25:40] more affection
[25:43] affection
[25:44] oh we all love each other as long as
[25:46] they like my candy
[25:48] but don't eat it
[25:51] get your own
[25:53] no we love it when people are happy with
[25:55] us don't we
[25:57] but agape love somebody that hates your
[25:59] guts that's what brother kindness is
[26:01] that'll be up there for people hate your
[26:04] guts
[26:05] and you still love them the same way
[26:09] that's why all of our love is
[26:11] conditional God's love is not
[26:16] God's love is unconditional
[26:19] you say well what about all these do's
[26:21] and don'ts he's just telling you that's
[26:23] his mind that's what you're supposed to
[26:24] be doing if you have agape love you will
[26:27] turn toward that every time prophet of
[26:29] God said a holy ghost fail woman won't
[26:31] put on a pair of pants the Holy Ghost
[26:33] feel one won't cut her hair not because
[26:34] not cause she doesn't want to because
[26:37] somebody will see it it's because deep
[26:39] down inside that God pay lovers inside
[26:42] like Jim says if a man can hang on a
[26:45] cross
[26:46] if a man can go through for three and a
[26:49] half years what he went through
[26:51] it's nothing for me to wear my long hair
[26:54] it's nothing for me to to not put on a
[26:56] pair not put on apparel that looks like
[26:59] the world
[27:00] let's just say that because you say
[27:02] dresses and pants well apparel that
[27:04] looks like the world is fashion and we
[27:07] need to get away from fashion
[27:09] and have on modest apparel amen and we
[27:12] discussed that
[27:14] just make sure listen husbands you know
[27:16] you're going to give an account for your
[27:17] wife she's not gonna give an account for
[27:19] you
[27:20] right so if you look over and you see
[27:21] her dressed a little bit different a
[27:23] little bit James that several times she
[27:24] said hey just looked good I said no go
[27:26] put on something else
[27:28] all right
[27:30] but some of you wives would probably
[27:31] slap your husband and divorce him if he
[27:33] said them
[27:34] hello somebody
[27:36] that's being subjective to not the
[27:38] husband you're being subjected to the
[27:40] word of God
[27:42] if you're subjective to the word of God
[27:44] then the husband's just there as a
[27:46] vehicle to love you even with filio love
[27:49] but by agape love hey go put some under
[27:52] that because when you bend over I don't
[27:54] want nobody to see what I can see
[27:56] because you're mine God's jealous he
[28:00] don't want the world to see what he sees
[28:03] amen
[28:05] so the first stage we're going to talk
[28:07] about is we've been talking about before
[28:08] is the birth you've got to be born again
[28:10] so I want us to really realize all those
[28:13] who are baptized spitting everywhere
[28:15] today everywhere that we look we see
[28:18] being born again
[28:23] be born again are we birthed into the
[28:26] body do we have that agape love and I
[28:28] saw
[28:30] because remember I'm going to read just
[28:32] two quotes for brother Brown says you
[28:34] either have faith
[28:35] or either have doubt
[28:37] and your soul is one of the other
[28:39] there's not five senses
[28:42] now I'm gonna warn you this afternoon
[28:43] I'm going to read a quote where brother
[28:46] Bynum in pre-1960 when he called the
[28:49] soul the five Realms of memory region
[28:51] conscious and then inside the spirit now
[28:53] we've been taught for years
[28:56] by Brother Dale
[28:58] that now God he switched it though
[29:01] he switches Doctrine he switched his
[29:03] terminology
[29:04] because he always had a center realm
[29:06] with faith or doubt the next round five
[29:08] the next round five so let's keep it
[29:10] together this afternoon when we start
[29:11] talking about the Tabernacle in the
[29:14] wilderness all right
[29:16] because that's you you're the Tabernacle
[29:17] in the wilderness amen Romans 8 verse 14
[29:20] for his minions are led by the spirit of
[29:22] God they are the sons of God for ye have
[29:25] not received the spirit of binds again
[29:26] to fear but you have received the spirit
[29:28] of adoption whereby we cry have a father
[29:31] every one of us had to start as a baby
[29:34] we all started as babies naturally and
[29:37] we started as babies spiritually the
[29:39] whole issue is is you got to eat
[29:43] to grow
[29:45] you become the word as you eat the word
[29:47] you become the world as you eat the
[29:50] world
[29:52] y'all are really quiet this morning
[29:54] that's okay as long as you don't fall
[29:55] asleep which some of you already are but
[29:57] I can't help it folks
[29:59] if this don't excite you you need to go
[30:01] find something that does
[30:03] I mean ESPN will give you like 24 7 of
[30:06] nothing but Sports
[30:08] keep you awake the whole time you'll be
[30:10] doing this
[30:13] you know what it's a spirit that's
[30:14] anointing you
[30:17] brother Bob and I were talking a few
[30:19] minutes ago you know you got this you
[30:21] got one Camp over here that that you
[30:23] listen to this preacher and you say well
[30:24] we've got all the Dynamics we need the
[30:26] mechanics then you got these over here
[30:28] it says we've got the mechanics we need
[30:30] the Dynamics
[30:31] let's bring them together
[30:33] I agree anything that doesn't move is
[30:37] dead
[30:39] some of you are close
[30:42] but every once in a while a little amen
[30:44] would be just fine with me
[30:47] brother Donnie says could you allow nod
[30:50] a little louder please
[30:52] all right
[30:54] you know what it's not getting down in
[30:55] the soul
[30:57] all this other stuff is stopping it
[31:00] flus are being plugged up but get down
[31:02] let that Inside Man work its way out
[31:06] the spirit itself very witnessed with
[31:08] our spirit that we are the children of
[31:10] God now children of God Gonna Act Like
[31:12] children of God
[31:14] and if children then heirs Heirs of God
[31:16] now that heirs what's your air I'm going
[31:18] to show you right here that's it
[31:21] that's your that's your that's your uh
[31:23] uh heir of Christ that was Christ
[31:26] but look if so be that we what suffer
[31:29] with him
[31:31] that may be also glorified together
[31:34] listen this is not a picnic it's a
[31:37] battle every day when you put your feet
[31:39] on the ground there's a battle
[31:42] which one wins chief
[31:45] the one I feed the most
[31:47] and if Luis was here he'd be the one on
[31:50] Netflix the most he boy talks about
[31:52] Netflix he must have stock in it or
[31:54] something I don't know
[31:57] he'll hear this I'll tell him when I
[31:58] talk to him
[32:00] but
[32:03] justification justification is what
[32:05] chopping off of your past sins get rid
[32:08] of that old person that old thing that
[32:10] bothered you just try to try to try to
[32:13] get rid of that all right but now look
[32:15] you got to come to sanctification and
[32:17] inside your souls where the unclean
[32:19] Spirit leaves you
[32:21] all right everybody with me on that not
[32:23] the spirit because we're going to talk
[32:24] about the spirit realm all those other
[32:26] little demons that can't get in your
[32:28] soul anymore when we start going outside
[32:30] your perfect man that's the ones that
[32:32] get in your five senses of memory
[32:33] reasons conservation imagination and by
[32:36] with me because that's you you say well
[32:38] brother Brown preached the greatest
[32:39] battle ever fought it's in your mind
[32:40] well where is your mind
[32:42] it's not your brain right
[32:44] right it's because somebody's in the
[32:46] control tower telling you no
[32:48] but you got the this part saying okay
[32:53] amen
[32:54] so the sanctification we're talking
[32:56] about in baby form is getting that
[32:58] unclean Spirit out let it die
[33:01] get it out and don't let it come back
[33:04] because we fill it with a holy ghost it
[33:06] seals you as we'll talk about here in
[33:08] just a second
[33:09] and then we talked about
[33:12] excuse me brother Bob said he's going to
[33:14] speak on this a little bit so that's
[33:15] good in Ezekiel
[33:17] because see remember he gives you a new
[33:19] spirit and that's not the spirit not the
[33:21] spirit of God to begin with
[33:23] hey bye with me when we go to the outer
[33:26] Court in the inner Court the inner court
[33:27] is not the holy of holies it's the holy
[33:29] place
[33:30] but that inner Court several priests
[33:33] could go into there
[33:35] everybody with me we'll talk about this
[33:37] afternoon you could go behind the first
[33:39] Veil and you'd have the candlesticks
[33:41] which was artificial light
[33:43] amen
[33:44] you had the shoe bread
[33:46] altar of incense
[33:48] not the holy of holies
[33:51] that's when you step in to
[33:54] sanctification
[33:56] if you don't get all that stuff gone out
[33:58] of you and going into the holy of holies
[34:00] this out here didn't do them people any
[34:01] good
[34:03] right it did not if that high priest
[34:05] didn't go behind that lack that second
[34:07] Veil the second Veil The Soul
[34:11] and God didn't come down and take the
[34:14] people's sins
[34:15] whatever happened in the second Court
[34:17] meant nothing right
[34:19] everybody with me
[34:22] so that's the same way with God now that
[34:24] Spirit isn't God's spirit that's your
[34:25] spirit God gives you a new spirit then
[34:28] he says I'll put my spirit in him step
[34:30] on into the holy of holies but the thing
[34:33] God has to do is give you a new spirit
[34:34] make your nature a little more gentle
[34:36] and settle down or he couldn't he live
[34:38] with you you know on the outside get
[34:40] into it this morning I'll talk about it
[34:41] this afternoon but the outside Court
[34:43] they can even call that was the court of
[34:45] gentiles
[34:47] that was court of the Gentiles anybody
[34:49] can go out there it was a mess
[34:52] sacrifices by the thousands Brazen
[34:54] authors the smell of of of of of
[34:57] entrance burning and and all that stuff
[35:00] and the priests having to wash theirself
[35:01] they made it
[35:03] foreign
[35:03] [Applause]
[35:07] we actually didn't wait on you but we've
[35:09] been
[35:10] waiting on you okay huh
[35:13] oh you're listening on the car okay all
[35:15] right so you already knew what a cop
[35:16] said about you limp okay
[35:18] well you can't do anything around here
[35:19] there's cameras everywhere and there's
[35:21] whatever
[35:25] so when you but but out here but now
[35:27] when you go you can't take all those
[35:28] other people and go into that second
[35:30] Veil which is sanctification
[35:33] it eliminates a whole bunch of junk
[35:36] right
[35:38] and there's only a certain amount of
[35:39] priests could go in this but only one in
[35:42] that
[35:43] Veil right there
[35:46] why did we need
[35:48] the Veil
[35:50] to be rent
[35:54] the world knows
[35:57] of Christendom that Jesus died on a
[36:00] cross for him and he was that high
[36:02] priest any you know the people
[36:03] understand that
[36:05] but you and I
[36:07] when the seals broke
[36:11] man didn't break them from the bottom to
[36:13] the top
[36:14] God broke them from heaven
[36:17] and broke them from the top and revealed
[36:20] who Christ was and that Christ could get
[36:23] into you and make the same life live in
[36:24] you that lived in him
[36:27] there's the difference that's the
[36:28] opening of the word in the end time
[36:31] so the baptism of the holy ghost seeing
[36:33] you have purified your soul soul Saul
[36:36] and obeying the truth through the spirit
[36:38] under unfeigned love of the Brethren
[36:39] what that's a Godly love unfeigned which
[36:41] means it doesn't if you love me I'll
[36:42] love you if you give me ten dollars I'll
[36:44] take it and and I'll owe you
[36:47] see that you love one another with a
[36:49] pure heart fervently
[36:52] remember that quote I read it first
[36:53] fervently
[36:56] I mean how many of you really like
[37:00] going to work
[37:04] some of you that are retired can think
[37:06] back
[37:07] Joe well Joe's got Brothers working yeah
[37:10] you go back into the room
[37:13] but most of us don't like
[37:16] so much to go to work because you know
[37:18] why because that's where the devils are
[37:20] all right
[37:21] but why not here
[37:25] why not here that we bring our Devils
[37:28] here with us
[37:30] being born again not a corruptable seed
[37:32] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[37:34] which liveth and abideth forever
[37:36] Romans 8 verse 29 says for whom he did
[37:39] 4-0 he also did predestinate to be
[37:41] conformed to the image of his son listen
[37:43] you and I are not just here we're
[37:46] predestinated to be here
[37:48] we're predestinated there is someone in
[37:50] this age is going to take this message
[37:53] and live it to a body change somebody
[37:55] you just got to decide whether you are
[37:57] or not
[37:59] for whom he did for no he also did
[38:01] predestinate to be conformed to the
[38:03] image of his son that he might want be
[38:04] the firstborn among many Brethren
[38:07] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[38:09] he called who he called he justified who
[38:11] he justified them he also glorified then
[38:15] what can we say if God be for us who can
[38:17] be against us but look Romans 11 says
[38:19] God hath not Cast Away his people which
[38:21] he foreknew
[38:23] you and I
[38:25] was what he came to die for he come to
[38:28] die for the whole world but to unveil
[38:30] itself to a small group of people oh
[38:33] bride
[38:35] amen
[38:38] an intimate relationship
[38:40] between you and God
[38:42] not just whatever goes on out here and
[38:45] whatever goes on out here no holy of
[38:47] holies there was actually there was two
[38:49] people in there
[38:51] God and that person but now
[38:54] it tells us to go back behind that Veil
[38:57] because the veil's been rent that we
[39:00] that if we don't go behind the veil is
[39:02] death to go behind the veil was death
[39:05] we'll talk about this afternoon though
[39:07] God had one man that could go behind
[39:10] that Veil
[39:12] and it didn't bother him didn't matter
[39:13] if he was anointed didn't matter what
[39:15] kind of clothes he had on hello somebody
[39:17] Moses could go in that Veil just about
[39:20] any time God told him to because we're
[39:22] going to see it this afternoon
[39:25] we're going to find out something that
[39:27] maybe some of you didn't know
[39:28] about Aaron's rod
[39:32] maybe I'll come back second service
[39:34] probably not but that start anyway in
[39:38] the dispensation of the fullness of
[39:39] times he might gather together and won
[39:41] all things in Christ's boats which are
[39:43] in heaven and which are on earth even in
[39:44] him who also look we have obtained an
[39:47] inheritance

[41:02] read it trouble of it is a lot of them
[41:05] never get embalmed
[41:07] you take the blood out of the man he's

[41:24] faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of
[41:27] Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus

[41:33] that's why the renewing of your mind is
[41:35] not well I'm just a patient person
[41:38] that ain't got nothing to do with being
[41:39] having Godly patients
[41:44] godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly
[41:46] kindness of Jesus Christ and look he
[41:48] wound it all up and the love of God
[41:50] which is Jesus Christ
[41:53] he's the head and controls you and your
[41:56] feet is the foundation Faith amen
[41:58] controlled by the head take the there
[42:01] you are there's the perfect man of God
[42:03] look when he possesses
[42:05] these virtues
[42:07] you got to possess them all right acts 1
[42:09] verse 4.
[42:11] he said to them this is Jesus talking
[42:13] it's not for you to know the times of
[42:15] the seasons which the father has put his
[42:16] own power but you shall receive power
[42:18] after
[42:19] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[42:22] and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[42:25] we're going to take the Tabernacle this
[42:27] afternoon
[42:28] it was after the high priest went in the
[42:31] high priest didn't go in there
[42:34] with the forgiveness
[42:37] he walked in there to get forgiveness
[42:39] but when he come out oh praise God he
[42:42] got it he ate for the whole nation they
[42:45] depended on that was the power that God
[42:48] give that high priest he could say oh
[42:49] Lord by all these people
[42:52] they've seen they've done this that and
[42:54] the other he said
[42:56] sprinkle the blood seven times on the on
[42:58] the post he said I know what they've
[43:00] done he said but if you'll do this
[43:03] you walk back out and you tell the whole
[43:05] nation your sins are forgiven for a year
[43:08] one year but now it's not one year folks
[43:11] now we go back in there and he says your
[43:14] sins are forgiven for an eternity
[43:18] hey man
[43:19] a more greater cloud of witness we have
[43:22] now a greater thing than just that
[43:25] Tabernacle was totally totally uh uh it
[43:29] was not permanent
[43:31] they had to pick it up okay and where is
[43:33] it today
[43:34] scattered everywhere the components of
[43:36] it scattered everywhere
[43:38] they put them in a temple and they put
[43:39] them over here and they put them in
[43:40] Solomon's Temple now we know who has
[43:42] them
[43:44] we know the Catholic church has all the
[43:45] menorah and all that other stuff
[43:48] what about that the very seed of Satan
[43:50] has
[43:52] God's equipment
[43:54] see how close that is though
[43:56] but you shall receive power after that
[43:59] you go behind the veil
[44:01] after you have no power before that you
[44:04] have power when you go behind the veil
[44:05] Jesus was telling them when I get into
[44:08] you
[44:09] because listen all the all the disciples
[44:11] they knew about that Tabernacle they
[44:14] went to the temple
[44:15] they had the outer Court the inner Court
[44:18] Solomon's Temple was still there during
[44:20] that day remember Jesus walked up in
[44:22] Matthew 24 they said well what about
[44:24] this he said
[44:25] they won't be a stone left after this is
[44:28] over with
[44:29] and they're like
[44:31] that's 40 something years to build this
[44:32] thing of course Jesus knew he knew they
[44:35] were talking about he knew he was
[44:36] talking about this body they were
[44:38] talking about a building but that
[44:39] building did get destroyed there's
[44:41] nothing left of that of that Temple
[44:44] just some Foundation stones
[44:47] remember
[44:48] the bride tree was eat down to a stump
[44:51] the bride tree was eat down to a
[44:53] foundation
[44:54] but it didn't touch the life
[44:56] the life is still there God is going to
[45:01] have life he's going to have a bride it
[45:03] may look bad you know we always hear the
[45:06] quote where people said somebody come up
[45:08] to us not several years ago and said boy
[45:10] really looks bad for the bride no never
[45:15] never
[45:16] it might look bad for the church
[45:18] it might look bad for the unbeliever it
[45:21] might look bad for the make-believer but
[45:23] it is not bad for the bride this is
[45:26] exactly where we're supposed to be this
[45:29] is exactly what we're supposed to do
[45:33] so if we're in the will of God
[45:36] whose other will you want to be
[45:38] the will of your flesh
[45:41] and you shall be witnessed unto me both
[45:42] Jerusalem Judea
[45:44] Lula Georgia
[45:45] and that power is dunamis so in other
[45:48] words you've got to go you got to go get
[45:50] it the high priest didn't say now Lord
[45:51] you you're gonna have to
[45:54] I'm on stream today
[45:56] sorry for the people I have to strain
[45:58] that's okay but if you stream and you
[46:01] but you healthy enough to come to church
[46:02] you're wrong
[46:05] so the high priest here we're going 20
[46:07] 20 22 the high priest is going
[46:10] Lord I'm not going behind the holy of
[46:12] holies today I don't uh I got this
[46:14] little sniffle
[46:16] but I'm gonna just pull you up online
[46:19] the whole nation of Israel would have
[46:21] died
[46:22] because God would not have forgiven with
[46:24] their sins
[46:25] but he had to go behind the veil he had
[46:27] to go do something he had to go into the
[46:30] holy of holies he had now he had to be
[46:33] dressed right he had to have a wall all
[46:35] over him he had to have a certain kind
[46:36] of
[46:40] to get back there
[46:42] and sprinkle and then he didn't stay
[46:45] there long he come out
[46:48] because you know why he had a message
[46:51] he had a powerful message that's why
[46:53] without the Holy Ghost you can't preach
[46:55] the message the way you're supposed to
[46:59] you can't
[47:00] because you hadn't went behind the bill
[47:02] why brother mom always say you got to go
[47:03] to the back side of the desert you got
[47:04] to have a burning bush experience you
[47:06] got to have a holy of holies you gotta
[47:07] have an experience
[47:09] because then you can come out with power
[47:11] or dunamis inherent power power residing
[47:15] in a thing or in a you
[47:20] number two
[47:23] so what is the Holy Ghost
[47:25] brother Daniel what's the Holy Ghost
[47:27] what is the Holy Ghost what's the
[47:29] evidence of the Holy Ghost those who had
[47:31] the spirit the teacher heard the word
[47:32] and that spirit in them took the word
[47:34] and taught it or revealed it to them
[47:37] and they were of that group that heard
[47:39] the messenger and his message and took
[47:42] it and lived it
[47:45] hmm
[47:48] Romans 10 verse 9 says if Thou shalt
[47:51] confess with thy mouth that's what we're
[47:52] talking about confession and believe in
[47:54] your heart that God has raised him from
[47:55] the dead Thou shalt be saved for with
[47:57] the heart man believeth unto
[47:58] righteousness and with the mouth
[48:00] confession is made unto salvation
[48:03] confesses to admit or declare oneself
[48:05] guilt of what one is accused of
[48:08] I'm a sinner Lord
[48:09] ain't nothing I can do about it right
[48:11] now but I can only say I'm giving it to
[48:13] you
[48:14] you said cast your burdens on me cast
[48:17] your cares give me
[48:19] because listen how many of us have ever
[48:21] forgiven ourself of our sins
[48:25] see that's silly we laugh
[48:29] if you justify what you do then guess
[48:31] what that's what it is it's you
[48:33] justifying yourself
[48:35] but let's lay it on the altar get rid of
[48:37] it confess your faults one to another
[48:39] pray one for another
[48:42] that you may be healed the effectual
[48:44] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[48:46] available I love these adjectives
[48:49] I love this we got to do something
[48:53] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[48:55] righteous man availeth much possessors
[48:57] to acquire get procure thing for oneself
[49:00] to possess the merry wife
[49:03] first Thessalonians that every one of
[49:05] you should know how to possess we read
[49:06] this before possess his vessel in
[49:09] sanctification and honor in other words
[49:10] if you sit in this church as long as you
[49:12] sit in this church
[49:14] we got problems trials and tribulations
[49:16] but we should know how to handle things
[49:18] we should know when the Devil comes and
[49:21] we see something and we're able to throw
[49:23] up a throw up a shield all right
[49:27] maybe we can't say that about every
[49:28] church but we can say that about this
[49:30] one amen we've been taught well
[49:37] when the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[49:39] is here to inspire you
[49:42] did you come here to get inspired by the
[49:44] holy ghost or just come in because I was
[49:46] going to talk about you if you didn't
[49:47] show up
[49:49] grief
[49:51] but when the inspiration of the holy
[49:53] spirit is here to inspire you
[49:56] remember God will make your body come
[50:00] into your confession
[50:05] if you say you're a drunkard you want a
[50:08] drink don't worry you'll get one
[50:11] if you say you're a sinner and want to
[50:12] sin you're be right into it if you say
[50:16] you're a Christian and believe it all
[50:18] along God will bring your testimony
[50:21] we'll bring you right into it if you
[50:23] believe in healing and believe that God
[50:26] has healed you confess it and God will
[50:28] make your body obey your confession for
[50:31] he is the high priest of your confession
[50:36] come on
[50:38] think about that
[50:40] so people touch the Garment of Jesus was
[50:42] made well others smacked him in the face
[50:44] remember the Romans hit him in the head
[50:46] with sticks spitting his face never felt
[50:48] any virtue at all it was their attitude
[50:51] of approach
[50:52] it depends
[50:54] you come in
[50:57] if you come believing that you're coming
[50:58] to get help and you're confident that
[51:00] you're coming to the right person not
[51:03] William Branham
[51:05] not Samuel Dale not Bob black
[51:08] Jesus Christ
[51:10] and your coming has provided way of
[51:13] approach
[51:15] everything had to be right
[51:19] you're going to receive something
[51:22] if you come reverently
[51:27] just like the brass serpent why the
[51:28] brass serpent the serpent didn't have
[51:30] any virtue it was a piece of brass they
[51:32] brought up out of Egypt neither did the
[51:34] pole have any virtue not a bit but it
[51:37] was obey what God Said do
[51:42] you know is that when we fall off yes
[51:44] I'll just go ahead and admit because
[51:46] you're not gonna say amen I like men and
[51:48] myself
[51:49] no obeying what God Said dudes what
[51:52] brought the power
[51:56] well I don't have no power I don't have
[51:57] no Victory are you doing exactly what
[51:59] God Said dude
[52:02] are you doing everything that you
[52:04] humanly possible and then not even
[52:06] humanly possible but supernaturally
[52:08] possible
[52:14] what brought the virtue is obedience to
[52:17] the word of God
[52:18] so it's not me telling you got to come
[52:20] to church if you don't have a guy to
[52:21] come to church better than you then
[52:23] you're of the devil
[52:28] Bob didn't get many amends out of that
[52:31] but that's what it is look obedience to
[52:34] the word of God that's the same thing
[52:36] tonight
[52:37] it was obeying what God Said does what
[52:40] brought the power what brought the
[52:42] virtue is obedience to the word of God
[52:45] not obedience to me or anybody else it's
[52:48] obedience to the word of God
[52:53] so like I said before these people
[52:55] leaving a message because they say
[52:56] brother Brown's wrong and this is wrong
[52:58] and this is wrong he's wrong here and
[53:00] he's wrong there that's okay but if you
[53:01] cut your hair and wear pants and don't
[53:03] go to church you're gonna have to talk
[53:05] to God about that not William Branham
[53:09] amen because God didn't change his mind
[53:12] about his word and he will not change
[53:14] his mind about his word whether you
[53:16] believe brother Brown was a prophet or
[53:17] not you still going to come to the day
[53:19] of judgment and you're gonna have to
[53:20] give an account of why you didn't do
[53:21] what the word of God said
[53:24] but without faith though it is
[53:26] impossible to please God
[53:29] for he that cometh to God must believe
[53:31] that he is because look that journey of
[53:33] Abraham he had to believe that man that
[53:36] was talking listen how many of you have
[53:38] had a a voice talk to you in your head
[53:41] and say that's God
[53:45] because sometimes that devil voice that
[53:47] talks to me sounds like God
[53:50] oh I guess I'm the only one
[53:54] you know you hear this big booming voice
[53:58] that don't have to be God
[54:01] that could be the devil okay
[54:03] a lot of times what what brother they'll
[54:05] always tell you that it was that little
[54:06] voice that said hey dummy wake up all
[54:10] right not naturally but spiritually hey
[54:12] dummy wake up
[54:14] because you don't have to haul and
[54:15] scream at you
[54:17] but without faith it's impossible to
[54:20] please God
[54:21] all right so you gotta have faith in
[54:22] what faith in the word
[54:25] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[54:28] diligently seek him let's continue a
[54:30] little bit further and be not conformed
[54:32] to this world but be transformed by the
[54:34] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[54:36] what is that good and acceptable and
[54:37] perfect will of God that word is
[54:39] anakinosis a renewal or a renovation
[54:43] like I said before Brother Gary Krantz
[54:45] if we'd have done something inside the
[54:46] house but this was outside the house but
[54:48] it's the same analogy at my house frame
[54:50] is still there but if we were going to
[54:52] tear out walls and put a new kitchen in
[54:54] and new floors there would be a dumpster
[54:56] out and there still way was one there
[54:58] for all the other stuff that we tore
[54:59] apart but why they need to be renovated
[55:02] God's not going to just take your your
[55:04] whole your body and just destroy you
[55:06] know he's going to use it because see
[55:08] that's Satan's got that one thing on you
[55:11] in his flesh
[55:12] born in sin shape that iniquity getting
[55:15] old that even hurts for me to do that
[55:19] oh some of y'all will say Amen later on
[55:22] but inside you though is a soul that's
[55:25] eternal is
[55:27] so God's going to use Satan's going to
[55:29] go they're getting older God
[55:32] did you see that
[55:34] can't you see that they're they're
[55:36] they're messing up and can't you see
[55:38] that oh look at that one look at that
[55:41] one what they just did
[55:44] and God's going all I see is is a God
[55:46] standing behind
[55:48] you you see these uh fountains that come
[55:51] out of nowhere and it's a whole sheet
[55:55] everybody you've seen those it just
[55:56] comes out of nowhere I have a wall and
[55:57] just a whole sheet that's a sheet of
[55:59] blood
[56:01] God says hang on a man
[56:03] oh they just repented
[56:05] it didn't even get to me it hit the
[56:08] blood and it was gone
[56:09] oh think about it you take you take your
[56:12] accuser he's got this whole list of
[56:14] stuff see that whole list
[56:16] and when he hands that to the judge it's
[56:19] got to go through it's got to go through
[56:21] that curtain
[56:23] go through that blood and when he hands
[56:26] it to when he hands it to God
[56:29] I wish it was blank but it's blank
[56:32] when it goes to that blood it just
[56:34] washes it all away
[56:36] a renovation a complete change for the
[56:39] worse
[56:43] no June likes her front porches screened
[56:45] in now because the Skeeters used to love
[56:48] her
[56:49] because she's so sweet
[56:53] they ain't like me they bit me and they
[56:55] died
[57:00] but really have you enjoyed your
[57:03] renovation
[57:05] have you enjoyed your renovation since
[57:07] you got born again have you enjoyed your
[57:09] renovation have you enjoyed your
[57:11] renovation since we're going to start a
[57:12] statue of perfect man and we're going to
[57:14] learn how to have the mind of God
[57:15] instead of the mind of the devil
[57:18] not going to take away our problems it's
[57:20] going to help us what live through them
[57:25] because these virtues look our old
[57:27] nature is contrary to God our own
[57:28] Nature's contrary to anything of God
[57:32] that's why we were born in sin shaping
[57:33] iniquity
[57:35] right but God's going to take that
[57:37] vessel that Satan is going
[57:40] I'm gonna give it arthritis
[57:42] I'm going to give it cancer I'm gonna
[57:44] give it this I'm gonna give it to him
[57:47] and Freda was here I know she's watching
[57:49] in those arms are going to go up
[57:51] as long as they're breath in that body
[57:54] and I'm gonna say thank you God
[57:56] you give me life and you give me eternal
[58:00] life whatever happens to this dumpster
[58:03] that
[58:03] Satan gave me
[58:07] amen there's a life in there
[58:10] and God hears your voice that's why
[58:13] confession is good for the soul
[58:16] confess it because you're talking into
[58:18] the blood curtain come on and past that
[58:21] blood curtain is nothing but white
[58:26] nothing but white
[58:28] screw it
[58:31] oh somebody say hallelujah thank you my
[58:34] goodness
[58:35] some are saying hallelujah some are
[58:37] saying let's hurry up and get finished
[58:39] beloved when I give all diligence to
[58:41] rounding to you the common salvation it
[58:43] was needful for me to write unto you
[58:44] this is Jude and assort you that you
[58:47] should earnestly contend for the faith
[58:48] which was once delivered unto the Saints
[58:51] for there are certain men crept in
[58:52] unawares Preachers
[58:55] brother Brown said word I have my
[58:56] problem the inside women
[59:00] he said preachers
[59:02] my worst problem
[59:04] for there are certain men trapped in
[59:05] unawares who were before of old ordained
[59:07] to this condemnation there's people put
[59:10] in your life
[59:13] to be a thorn in your flesh
[59:16] but what does it do though
[59:18] God forgive them
[59:20] if he's out in the world you'd figure
[59:21] out how to kill him
[59:23] but God forgive them
[59:25] forgive them Lord for they know not
[59:29] did you understand what that means
[59:31] God was hanging on a cross dying
[59:34] he said father forgive them for they
[59:37] know not
[59:39] they didn't know that was a messiah
[59:42] they didn't know that was God in human
[59:43] flesh to them to those Romans it was
[59:46] just another guy that got caught
[59:48] somewhere excuse me and they they got
[59:52] this uh judgment and they're dying and
[59:55] we're just going to take the Flesh and
[59:56] throw it in this dumpster and we'll
[59:58] never see him again
[1:00:02] until Joseph Obama Thea walks up and
[1:00:04] says
[1:00:05] can I have that
[1:00:07] he was inspired by God can I have that
[1:00:10] body
[1:00:11] I want to take it down and put it in a
[1:00:13] tomb
[1:00:14] and of course we're all my soldiers like
[1:00:16] saves us from having to drag this
[1:00:18] thinking thing off the cross really I
[1:00:20] mean come on that's that's the world
[1:00:21] that's the world looks at you and says
[1:00:24] why are you different
[1:00:26] that's because what was inside of us is
[1:00:28] what was different what was inside of
[1:00:30] Jesus because outside he didn't look
[1:00:32] different
[1:00:33] he looked just like me and you
[1:00:36] but inside of the inside that was God
[1:00:39] no less
[1:00:43] if you're born again today guess what
[1:00:45] no less God lives in you too
[1:00:50] so in other words you got preachers
[1:00:52] preaching false Doctrine ungodly men
[1:00:55] turning the grace of our God into
[1:00:56] lasciviousness and denying the only God
[1:00:58] in our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:01] here's Jesus standing up telling them
[1:01:03] he answered the center to them well half
[1:01:05] Isaiah's prophesied of you Hypocrites as
[1:01:08] it is written this people honor me with
[1:01:10] their lips but their heart heart
[1:01:12] their heart their soul is far from me
[1:01:15] how being in vain they do worship me
[1:01:20] he's not talking to Sinners he's talking
[1:01:23] to church people
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:27] I'm being in vain do they worship me
[1:01:30] teaching preaching over the pulpit
[1:01:35] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:01:39] for laying aside the Commandment of God
[1:01:42] you hold the traditions of men
[1:01:48] when I asked that person one time I said
[1:01:49] look who told you you could cut your
[1:01:52] hair
[1:01:53] who told you you could wear pants who
[1:01:56] told you you could baptize the way you
[1:01:58] get baptized some man had to tell you
[1:02:00] that it wasn't God
[1:02:03] but somebody stood in the Pulpit said
[1:02:06] well you ain't perfect and I ain't
[1:02:07] perfect
[1:02:08] oh we were talking about this
[1:02:11] the post office I wish they'd quit

[1:02:40] your dirty laundry you're right yeah
[1:02:41] you're cutting hair bring it here

[1:02:53] other day
[1:02:54] people

[1:03:15] in human being
[1:03:19] brings them closer you know what God can
[1:03:21] help him if we bring him closer

[1:04:50] around prostitutes he hung around
[1:04:52] alcoholic he hung around people like
[1:04:55] that why

[1:05:01] these are the people I come for you I
[1:05:03] can't help
[1:05:05] you religious people I can't help but
[1:05:08] I'm gonna help these Common People okay

[1:05:40] everybody around them
[1:05:41] why do you do that I don't know I mean
[1:05:43] it just drags your earlobes down and
[1:05:45] when you get older you're going to look
[1:05:46] like an elephant but anyway
[1:05:48] um
[1:05:49] it's not good for you
[1:05:50] but who took her in the office

[1:06:14] she wore she never cut her hair after
[1:06:16] that
[1:06:17] never wore pants
[1:06:20] now most people in the message would
[1:06:22] give her 30 days
[1:06:24] and would have took her in the office
[1:06:25] and said don't come in here anymore
[1:06:27] without with that apparel on
[1:06:30] now listen folks there is a point
[1:06:33] but if you really preach the word of
[1:06:35] money if you really get down to the word
[1:06:37] of God and preach to the people and it
[1:06:39] clicks in their soul that soul will turn
[1:06:42] them not you
[1:06:44] I turned in people today God's gonna
[1:06:46] have to do it God's gonna turn what's
[1:06:49] inside of you and you say well sin is
[1:06:52] not with us she's an old relationship in
[1:06:54] a home right
[1:06:55] I I believe she's safe yeah
[1:06:58] I believe she's going to have a we will
[1:07:00] see her yeah yeah we didn't throw her
[1:07:03] out
[1:07:04] we preached to her and we didn't preach
[1:07:06] to her
[1:07:10] you don't have to do that
[1:07:14] but what if she'd been in a place where
[1:07:16] though where they held the traditions of
[1:07:17] men
[1:07:18] of washing of pots and washing your face
[1:07:21] and putting on the right kind of clothes
[1:07:23] now we know we've we preach Holiness you
[1:07:25] know that
[1:07:26] We Don't Preach greasy Grace
[1:07:28] you're not going Cindy wasn't going to
[1:07:30] be here a year still doing what she was
[1:07:31] doing
[1:07:33] but you could just see something the
[1:07:34] wheels turning
[1:07:36] now some people you know what's going to
[1:07:38] happen they're either going to stay or
[1:07:39] leave they ain't going to stay under
[1:07:41] this
[1:07:42] and we've had some move into our midst
[1:07:46] and then leave you know
[1:07:48] and they did it on their own right and
[1:07:50] they did it on their own
[1:07:52] right I was watching the baptism the
[1:07:55] other day we baptized a couple of people
[1:07:57] that I can't remember what his name is
[1:07:58] but
[1:07:59] anyway
[1:08:01] yeah so anyway but you see those people
[1:08:04] I mean you you still pray for them but
[1:08:06] but they'll ease their self out you
[1:08:08] don't have to preach them out they'll
[1:08:09] ease yourself out but also then people
[1:08:11] will ease yourself in too and manafort
[1:08:14] just preached the word of God drop a
[1:08:16] little truth in every once in a while
[1:08:18] drop a little bit of of reading of the
[1:08:20] Bible of Deuteronomy and and Corinthians
[1:08:24] and how to how to be a good Christian
[1:08:26] and how that God will change you not you
[1:08:28] change God yeah
[1:08:30] but by the traditions of man that's what
[1:08:32] Jesus was telling them and he said unto
[1:08:34] them full well you reject the
[1:08:37] Commandment of God
[1:08:39] that ye may keep your own tradition
[1:08:42] that you may keep your own two Soul
[1:08:45] Doctrine or seventh under Doctrine or or
[1:08:47] I will come here with a seed in me
[1:08:54] that's not God
[1:08:56] so they lost that that was lost faith so
[1:09:00] we had to get back to the faith of the
[1:09:01] fathers we had to have a man named
[1:09:03] William Branham that we put our
[1:09:05] confidence in that God brought the mind
[1:09:08] of himself
[1:09:10] screw that man and that man could just
[1:09:13] move over
[1:09:15] and God could say
[1:09:17] thus saith the Lord
[1:09:20] thus saith the Lord
[1:09:22] this is what I'm trying to tell you
[1:09:23] people brother Brown will say that God
[1:09:26] is trying to get us back to the faith of
[1:09:28] the fathers that's what the Elijah
[1:09:30] Ministry was done to right
[1:09:33] it was done to bring us back to the
[1:09:35] faith of the fathers back to what get
[1:09:37] rid of the traditions
[1:09:39] and get back to the faith of the fathers
[1:09:42] everybody all right
[1:09:43] let me read this quote real quick and
[1:09:45] we'll close
[1:09:46] now in the Old Testament
[1:09:48] are placed into the family look his name
[1:09:51] was just as good on the check as his
[1:09:53] daddy's was
[1:09:54] they didn't have they had a ring in them
[1:09:56] days a Signet
[1:09:57] brother around makes a spitting sound
[1:09:58] and hits the pulpit well I'm not gonna
[1:10:00] do that
[1:10:01] spit on it place it there was a Signet
[1:10:03] that was just as he wore his daddy's
[1:10:05] ring it wasn't his it was his daddy's
[1:10:08] and that was just as good as his daddy's
[1:10:10] now when Jesus had been obedient Jesus
[1:10:13] to God God placed him positionally this
[1:10:16] is him now listen to this right here now
[1:10:18] when the member is born by the Holy
[1:10:20] Ghost into the family of God
[1:10:22] all right stop right there
[1:10:24] that's what we've been talking about for
[1:10:26] the past 50 sermons trying to get you
[1:10:28] get to get you to the new birth to where
[1:10:30] the Holy Ghost bursts you into the
[1:10:31] family of God
[1:10:33] and has proven to have these virtues in
[1:10:36] him continue on that God can see virtue
[1:10:41] knowledge Temperance patience brotherly
[1:10:44] kindness godliness in him then God seals
[1:10:47] him or places him now now listen you can
[1:10:50] take this quote and and some of the
[1:10:52] people in the message say well well see
[1:10:53] there brother you got to be all the way
[1:10:54] up there before God seals you with the
[1:10:56] Holy Ghost see there is a Doctrine and a
[1:10:58] message you got to go all the way up
[1:10:59] here before you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:11:00] can't get these virtues without having a
[1:11:01] holy ghost
[1:11:03] that is a that is a ceiling of
[1:11:07] everything else
[1:11:08] remember Sister Shepard's Dream Water
[1:11:11] trash
[1:11:13] she is already born again
[1:11:15] but she had some trash
[1:11:17] same way with me and you
[1:11:19] then God seals him or places him and
[1:11:22] there that's when you see the Sons and
[1:11:25] Daughters of God
[1:11:30] let's read this real quick perfect faith
[1:11:31] is a master of all circumstances perfect
[1:11:34] Faith Masters all circumstances let's
[1:11:36] continue on we didn't get into this but
[1:11:38] remember the trying of your faith work
[1:11:40] is patience but let patience have a
[1:11:42] perfect work that what you may be
[1:11:44] perfect an entire wanting nothing
[1:11:48] is that scripture
[1:11:50] you say oh I got these needs I got these
[1:11:52] needs let God start taking care of them
[1:11:54] problem is you don't want it you want to
[1:11:56] keep them
[1:11:59] or you can amen if you want to
[1:12:02] what brother Brown tell about that woman
[1:12:05] your brother Brown why did that evil
[1:12:07] spirit come back on that woman
[1:12:09] you know what he said
[1:12:10] she loved it
[1:12:13] she loved the spirit so it came right
[1:12:15] back that's our problem that's my
[1:12:17] problem that's your problem
[1:12:18] you get through with something and
[1:12:20] something else pops up to get through
[1:12:21] something else something else pops up
[1:12:23] but the trying of your faith working
[1:12:25] patience
[1:12:27] crying of your faith
[1:12:29] so it's got to be tried the Bible says
[1:12:32] with fire
[1:12:33] oh my goodness that you may be perfect
[1:12:36] in entire warning nothing now James
[1:12:39] tells us this little man say have faith
[1:12:41] and have not works can Faith save him
[1:12:43] now as we continue on down through here
[1:12:44] we know what that is
[1:12:46] James looks like it means this all works
[1:12:48] and Paul's talking about all of Faith
[1:12:52] but now look
[1:12:53] watch us right here thank God for a
[1:12:55] prophet
[1:12:56] faith without works is dead
[1:12:59] all right now Paul was speaking in
[1:13:01] Romans about justifying Abraham by faith
[1:13:03] and James is justifying by works but it
[1:13:06] does not contradict
[1:13:07] Paul was speaking of what God saw
[1:13:11] James is speaking of what man saw in
[1:13:13] Abraham
[1:13:15] I want to ask you today
[1:13:18] before we close
[1:13:22] Paul
[1:13:24] is talking to you through the Bible
[1:13:26] about what God sees
[1:13:29] all right
[1:13:31] right got it Paul is telling us
[1:13:34] justified by faith you believe in God
[1:13:37] it was unputed imputed unto him for
[1:13:39] righteousness and then James came back
[1:13:41] and says hey
[1:13:43] faith without some works is dead
[1:13:47] so what are you doing so you're on this
[1:13:49] side
[1:13:50] of that blood Shield
[1:13:52] cause on this side of the bloodshield
[1:13:55] you're God's kids
[1:13:57] you're perfect that Genesis 1 26 man is
[1:13:59] perfect
[1:14:00] but there's a part of that still inside
[1:14:02] of you on this side
[1:14:04] everybody with me
[1:14:05] so what you got to do is is you got to
[1:14:08] make sure
[1:14:09] This is Gonna Hurt
[1:14:11] that you make sure that the people on
[1:14:13] this side see the same thing God sees on
[1:14:15] this side
[1:14:18] everybody with me that hurt didn't it
[1:14:20] well then
[1:14:22] at least it was a frontal assault not
[1:14:23] from the back
[1:14:25] but look that's what Paul was talking
[1:14:27] about what God saw Abraham
[1:14:29] he was nothing was accounted to Abraham
[1:14:32] on this side
[1:14:33] everybody with me
[1:14:35] perfect
[1:14:38] um staggered not
[1:14:40] at the promises of God on this side
[1:14:44] but over here on this side
[1:14:47] we're reminded he gave his wife away
[1:14:49] twice
[1:14:51] he laughed at God one time he did all
[1:14:54] these things he he was supposed to go by
[1:14:56] himself he took lot with him he was
[1:14:58] supposed to go here he went there
[1:15:00] but over here on this side
[1:15:02] God said
[1:15:04] man after my own heart David on this
[1:15:06] side murderer
[1:15:07] liar
[1:15:10] adulterer
[1:15:13] apple of my eye
[1:15:15] the man I want to see is right there so
[1:15:19] same way with me and you let out now now
[1:15:21] though now though they did that without
[1:15:24] the new birth
[1:15:26] we have the new birth on this side
[1:15:29] supposed to be the same as on this side
[1:15:32] so the veil's been wrapped
[1:15:36] right face to face
[1:15:37] let's stand
[1:15:39] let's let the people see from this day
[1:15:41] forward what God sees
[1:15:44] there's your works
[1:15:47] it's good to have faith know all
[1:15:49] Mysteries
[1:15:51] but have not love
[1:15:53] have not the love of God
[1:15:55] in your heart
[1:15:59] God bless you
[1:16:01] Paul was speaking of what God saw
[1:16:05] James was speaking of what man saw in
[1:16:07] Abraham
[1:16:08] let's do one more quote
[1:16:10] look
[1:16:11] what faith you have
[1:16:14] that's what God sees
[1:16:16] but what your works is
[1:16:18] what your neighbor sees
[1:16:21] hmm
[1:16:22] are they the same
[1:16:25] show me your works by your faith without
[1:16:27] your faith and I'll show you my works by
[1:16:30] my face
[1:16:34] we've got a
[1:16:36] our neighbors are are homosexuals
[1:16:39] and I think everybody knows that pretty
[1:16:41] much
[1:16:43] but and they know we go to church and
[1:16:45] they've asked us probably more questions
[1:16:47] about what our
[1:16:49] um religion is than people in the
[1:16:51] community they just they just have their
[1:16:53] own opinion
[1:16:55] but Mike said what what is I mean just
[1:16:57] tell me what's what is it do you believe
[1:17:00] so we did kind of you know in a short
[1:17:02] version
[1:17:04] now what if though
[1:17:06] none of y'all well mom and dad lived
[1:17:09] behind me and Terence and all them too
[1:17:10] but what if he lived isolated off in the
[1:17:12] woods somewhere like you did
[1:17:15] and you're down there and you go
[1:17:29] tell me you can't hide it and I don't
[1:17:30] know who's smoking cigarettes I'm just
[1:17:31] saying that because I had a revelation
[1:17:33] this weekend
[1:17:34] my aunt that I've known for 50 years
[1:17:37] I never knew she Smoked Cigarettes
[1:17:42] Pat Turpin
[1:17:44] did you know Patrick so I see that I did
[1:17:46] the same thing
[1:17:48] uh-huh
[1:17:50] yes ma'am all her life I told Ray her
[1:17:53] husband I said when did she start
[1:17:55] smoking he said when did she stop
[1:17:58] he bought three packs of Virginia Slims
[1:18:00] and I knew they weren't for him
[1:18:02] I said who you getting him for of course
[1:18:04] me he said Pat did Pat smoke yeah I even
[1:18:08] know it so see you can hide it
[1:18:11] but you can't hide it from God
[1:18:13] and I don't know anybody smoking but
[1:18:14] let's just put whatever else we do when
[1:18:17] nobody's around to see it okay
[1:18:19] cigarettes or whatever you want to say
[1:18:21] but that was a revelation it was to me
[1:18:23] buddy I'm like oh really

[1:18:28] we'll close
[1:18:29] that's what's the matter with the people
[1:18:32] many of them
[1:18:35] but they're afraid
[1:18:37] brother Daniel they're afraid to launch
[1:18:39] out with it
[1:18:42] you're just afraid to venture a little
[1:18:44] bit
[1:18:46] just say well I can I can do all things
[1:18:49] with Christ
[1:18:51] who strengthens me

[1:19:10] but he's going to show let man see what
[1:19:14] God sees I know that's hard I know we're
[1:19:16] humans we do things contrary to God
[1:19:18] every day but he said in his word
[1:19:21] that we got to be perfect
