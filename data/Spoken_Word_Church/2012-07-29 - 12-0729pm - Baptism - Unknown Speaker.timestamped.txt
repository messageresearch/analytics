[0:14] get it started heavenly father it's just
[0:16] a joy to
[0:18] be able to participate in this kind of
[0:20] occasion see these
[0:22] these five new converse to this word
[0:25] hearing the word
[0:26] catching their attention
[0:38] a new attitude and you desire a new a
[0:41] new heart i'll give you
[0:57] i want to uh we always read the
[0:59] scripture here and it's
[1:00] always one fitting and it's a sermon in
[1:03] itself
[1:04] but we're not going to keep you long but
[1:05] we need we do need to realize while
[1:08] we're here
[1:09] we're not here just to get someone wet
[1:13] or to give them a new position in life
[1:16] no life tomorrow is going to be just as
[1:18] hard as life was yesterday
[1:20] right but it's made a little bit easier
[1:23] by being
[1:24] dead in christ and not being
[1:28] alive to the world that's what we're
[1:30] doing here today
[1:32] let's look in romans chapter six
[1:35] we see paul and what he says is what
[1:37] shall we say then he's asking a question
[1:40] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[1:42] abound
[1:43] question god forbid all right what shall
[1:47] we say then shall we continue in sin
[1:50] and grace may abound god forbid how
[1:52] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[1:54] longer therein
[1:55] for the old man's death know you not
[1:58] that so many of us if we're baptized
[2:00] into jesus christ we're baptized into
[2:02] his death
[2:03] that's what we're going to do today
[2:05] we're going down
[2:07] we're going to be buried and we're going
[2:09] to come back up
[2:10] in newness of life therefore we are
[2:13] buried with him by baptism
[2:15] into death that like as christ was
[2:18] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[2:20] the father even so we also should walk
[2:23] in newness of life for we have been
[2:26] planted together in the likeness of his
[2:28] death
[2:29] we shall be also in the likeness of his
[2:31] resurrection
[2:33] knowing this that our old man is
[2:34] crucified with him
[2:36] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[2:38] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[2:40] for he that is dead he's free from sin
[2:44] many times we've made this this
[2:47] statement but
[2:48] my grandfather on my dad's side
[2:51] died in 1945.
[2:55] now you couldn't convict that man of
[2:58] robbing a bank yesterday why
[3:02] he's dead that man does not live anymore
[3:05] so you can't accuse the dead man
[3:08] of anything right that's what we're
[3:10] doing today
[3:13] going down live coming back the old man
[3:17] he's gonna wash away and bring the new
[3:20] man up
[3:21] you and don't don't know the scriptural
[3:24] baptism we're gonna
[3:25] read it right here sure this is not what
[3:28] jesus said
[3:29] well we're gonna read you what jesus
[3:31] said
[3:34] acts 2.
[3:37] paul and peter preaching a sermon
[3:41] about jesus christ listen verse 37 now
[3:43] when they heard this they were pricked
[3:45] in their heart
[3:47] what brother tom was saying they weren't
[3:48] pricked in their spirit
[3:50] or their body they were pricked in their
[3:51] heart down in the very
[3:53] very soul of man
[3:56] and said unto peter and to the rest of
[3:58] the apostles men and brethren what shall
[3:59] we do
[4:01] that was your question that was your
[4:02] question what shall we do
[4:04] then peter said unto them the very first
[4:06] thing we should do is
[4:07] repent you're not repented you'll just
[4:11] go down a wet
[4:12] center or dry center and come up away
[4:14] all right
[4:15] but repent and be baptized every one of
[4:18] you in the name of jesus christ for the
[4:20] remission of sins
[4:21] and listen to this promise and you shall
[4:23] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[4:26] for the promise what promise the
[4:28] prophecy getting hold of right
[4:30] isn't to you and to your children and to
[4:32] all that are far off
[4:33] even as many as the lord our god shall
[4:36] call
[4:37] and on that day there were three
[4:38] thousand souls added
[4:40] just because of one man's sermon now you
[4:43] say why don't we baptize in the name of
[4:45] the father and of the son of the holy
[4:46] ghost
[4:47] well my name is samuel wade dale
[4:51] i'm a father i'm a son and i'm a human
[4:54] being
[4:55] but i don't sign my checks father i
[4:58] don't sign my check son even though i am
[5:00] the son of samuel doubt
[5:02] but what identifies me is my name
[5:06] right my name is what i'm identified
[5:08] with so jesus was saying he was saying
[5:10] go into
[5:11] all the world preach the gospel
[5:14] baptizing them in the name of the father
[5:16] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[5:19] well what is the name of the father and
[5:21] of the son and of the holy ghost
[5:22] lord jesus christ jesus said in all
[5:25] words indeed do what do in the name of
[5:27] jesus christ
[5:28] not the name of the father you scream
[5:30] father all day and you don't know what
[5:32] it is but if you call someone's name
[5:34] that identifies who they are
[5:36] so peter given the keys to the kingdom
[5:40] he wasn't uh like uh brother tom was
[5:43] saying sure he had his problems in his
[5:45] in his uh part of life when jesus was
[5:48] there but when
[5:49] when that same god came into the heart
[5:50] of peter
[5:52] when i'm saying jesus came into the
[5:53] heart of peter he said peter when you're
[5:56] converted
[5:57] strengthen the brethren so the first
[5:58] thing he did was they had pentecost
[6:00] jesus told him said peter said whatever
[6:02] you bind on earth i'll find it in heaven
[6:04] whatever you loose on earth i'll loose
[6:06] in heaven
[6:07] so who better person that had a key than
[6:10] peter
[6:11] on the day of pentecost it wasn't any
[6:14] other it was peter
[6:15] would god give him the key he said
[6:17] whatever you find on earth
[6:19] i'll bind in heaven whatever you loose
[6:21] on earth i'll loose in heaven
[6:24] he said but to fulfill all righteousness
[6:27] you gotta baptize me all right
[6:30] that's what we gotta do
[6:46] oh
[6:55] let this be a possession if the devil
[6:59] comes to you
[6:59] you take him back to this moment right
[7:01] here he said look
[7:03] the old dave howard was dead i don't
[7:05] live no more
[7:07] right i'm dead take him back to this
[7:09] spot if you have to walk up here i don't
[7:11] care my brother won't mind if you could
[7:13] you come right here you said look this
[7:15] is where i died
[7:17] see i can take him back to the funeral
[7:18] home and i'm taking him back to the
[7:20] graveyard and i said that's what my
[7:21] grandfather was buried
[7:22] so that's where we buried him we're
[7:24] going to bury you today
[7:25] okay all right
[7:28] fulfill the great commission to baptize
[7:31] all new converts now that's converged
[7:34] in the name of the father and of the son
[7:36] and of the holy ghost i now baptize my
[7:38] brother david houseman
[7:40] hallelujah in the name of the lord jesus
[7:42] christ amen
[8:04] i've been wanting to do this a long time
[8:15] in accordance to the scripture to
[8:17] baptize all new converts in the name of
[8:19] the father and of the son and of the
[8:20] holy ghost
[8:21] i now baptize my brother joey knight
[8:25] hallelujah in the name of the lord jesus
[8:38] christ
[8:43] you know that old place that i was
[8:45] baptized they've about filled it in they
[8:47] are going to make a bridge and they tore
[8:48] down that tree
[8:50] i love that old tree because i never
[8:53] forget when i came out of the water
[8:55] brother didn't give it he said there's
[8:57] angels
[8:58] sitting in those tree limbs so there's
[9:01] angels
[9:03] sitting in those trees you know what
[9:06] whatever i find on earth i'll bind in
[9:08] heaven
[9:10] we just bound two men for the gospel of
[9:12] jesus christ
[9:14] now it's their job to walk in newness
[9:18] of life go back to the old man the old
