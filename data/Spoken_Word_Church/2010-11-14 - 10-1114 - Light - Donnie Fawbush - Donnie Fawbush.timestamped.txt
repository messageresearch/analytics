[3:01] precious Name Lord Jesus Christ amen
[3:05] uh you got your Bible I want to turn to
[3:07] Genesis one we're going to speak on a
[3:09] little subject that's come to me the
[3:11] other night and uh
[3:15] we're gonna talk about light
[3:17] I want to talk about life this morning
[3:21] um
[3:22] it's not no one
[3:27] yeah
[3:30] okay sorry about that we're going to
[3:33] talk about light this morning
[3:36] um
[3:38] I like it it's got five letters fits
[3:40] right in there with faith in Jesus I
[3:42] love that but we know that numbers don't
[3:45] mean a whole lot other than there are
[3:47] five letters in it and first of all I'd
[3:49] like to read Genesis 1.
[3:53] all right sister two Delights that part
[3:57] Dennis is one two five
[4:00] and get to it I'll bear with me
[4:02] everybody there
[4:04] in the beginning God created the Heaven
[4:06] and the Earth and the Earth was without
[4:08] form and void and darkness was upon the
[4:11] face of the deep and the spirit of God
[4:13] moved upon the face
[4:15] of the waters
[4:18] and God said let there be light and
[4:21] there was because he came down here we
[4:23] know that because he is light and God
[4:25] saw the light that it was
[4:28] was good and God divided the light from
[4:31] the darkness and God called the light
[4:34] day in the darkness he called night and
[4:37] the evening and the morning were the
[4:39] first day now
[4:41] there's a another scripture the same
[4:44] John 1
[4:48] I love this
[4:50] sitting there last night I was waiting
[4:51] at night I kind of time to see if I
[4:54] could find any difference in it but I
[4:55] couldn't
[4:56] because there's nothing there to be
[4:58] different it's all the same
[5:06] all right we're going to read John 1-10
[5:07] and in the beginning was the word and
[5:09] the Word was with God and the Word was
[5:11] God the same was in the beginning with
[5:13] God
[5:14] all things were made by him
[5:17] and without him was not anything made
[5:19] that was made in him was life and the
[5:22] light was the light of men
[5:24] and the light shineth and darkness and
[5:27] the Darkness comprehended it not
[5:30] there was a man sent from God whose name
[5:32] was John
[5:34] the same came for a witness to Bear
[5:36] witness of the light that all men
[5:39] through him might be leave he was not
[5:42] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[5:45] of that likeness well unless John
[5:48] that was the True Light which
[5:51] lendeth every man that cometh into the
[5:54] world he was in the world and the world
[5:57] wait a minute
[6:03] the world was made by him and the world
[6:06] knew him not
[6:09] now there ain't a whole lot of
[6:11] difference there because we know what
[6:13] the light is
[6:15] in the beginning and now we're over here
[6:18] four thousand years starting the four
[6:20] thousand years or two thousand and four
[6:22] thousand right here with John
[6:25] uh download research on this word called
[6:28] light
[6:29] uh
[6:31] light brains forth truth Revelation one
[6:35] goodness of God
[6:39] also God's Plan of Redemption
[6:43] Darkness
[6:44] symbolizes error and faults
[6:49] truth and it also symbolizes evil in the
[6:54] works of Satan amen
[6:56] so
[6:57] you look and see one you got to see the
[7:00] other one
[7:01] it's kind of like looking through the
[7:02] seals
[7:03] see one riding the way you see one stand
[7:05] there holding that book
[7:07] and any part of it you got to see
[7:10] who the light is
[7:11] when I first came in here I was trying
[7:13] to figure out who that white horse rider
[7:15] was I was focusing too much on that
[7:16] white horse right all I had to do was
[7:17] look in the mirror there he was
[7:21] but it took a while God says no
[7:24] you're supposed to be seeing me and
[7:25] what's Happening Here
[7:27] anyway
[7:29] I wonder
[7:30] man has always been fascinated with
[7:34] light
[7:34] throughout time they've
[7:37] looked at light and and thought it to be
[7:40] something that they didn't understand
[7:41] what light is
[7:44] uh they even went to the point where
[7:46] there was Sun worshipers throughout all
[7:48] time even today well I know back during
[7:50] the second World War I don't know what
[7:51] they're doing in Japan now but you had
[7:53] all those people who worshiped the light
[7:55] all of that uh the people uh in
[7:59] Babylonian time uh right on through the
[8:01] Greeks they worshiped the Sun and light
[8:05] they dwelled on that light and they had
[8:07] no revelation of what light really meant
[8:11] but they've seen that sun hanging out
[8:13] there and they worshiped it which
[8:15] godness let them or I'm sorry the devil
[8:19] he led them to that light the wrong
[8:21] light
[8:23] I wanted to go over to uh
[8:26] Exodus 10 23 uh
[8:30] where if y'all want to turn that's okay
[8:33] I can pretty much tell you what I want
[8:35] to say about that that's that's where
[8:37] Moses
[8:38] call down judgment or Darkness
[8:41] uh everything Stood Still or stood dark
[8:44] for three days but the only people there
[8:47] that that had light and they had it in
[8:49] their homes was
[8:51] people of Israel
[8:57] and then in Exodus 28 16
[9:01] .
[9:02] is a I'm not going to ask you to go
[9:05] there because I'm not going to read all
[9:06] that what that's about is the
[9:07] breastplate of the year of Thurman which
[9:10] showed Delight
[9:13] um
[9:14] mostly 28 I mean 16 through 30 is where
[9:18] the instructions of the of the
[9:19] lighthouse was to be put together Hyatt
[9:21] was adorned and how it was worn and
[9:23] Aaron had to wear it over his heart when
[9:25] he went before the presence of the Lord
[9:28] that Aaron Thurman was used for right on
[9:32] up through the time of Ezra
[9:35] was I think was one of the last times
[9:37] they may have used that particular used
[9:39] it there the scripture said and but
[9:41] anyway that you're determined what it
[9:43] meant was
[9:44] is uh
[9:47] the lights in perfection
[9:50] and it was it was put there
[9:53] representing the Lord
[9:55] his presence so he would bring those
[9:57] lights you also had
[9:59] um
[10:00] the people when they were
[10:03] Moses had him out of the desert for what
[10:05] they followed that Pillar of Fire right
[10:07] uh when they had the uh built the temple
[10:11] what was the Shekinah Glory
[10:13] it was light
[10:15] God's always period
[10:18] to us with his life
[10:20] he's always brought himself through that
[10:22] light shining that light on us
[10:25] that he might get our attention because
[10:27] he's trying to show us something
[10:29] and it's uh
[10:31] taking a long time to get us to this
[10:33] point but time ain't nothing to him but
[10:36] this light's always been here with us
[10:38] and I was coming over here the last time
[10:41] that I I that I could pick up they used
[10:43] in the scripture was in 5 BC where Ezra
[10:46] in 263 they had a problem with some of
[10:49] the priests and they had a problem with
[10:51] their genealogy because some of them
[10:53] married and in or out and wasn't married
[10:55] right and so they brought that
[10:58] breastplate in
[11:00] the sword after him priest it didn't
[11:02] belong there
[11:03] and got them out of there
[11:05] and uh
[11:07] then
[11:09] come on down to where Jeremiah was in
[11:12] the days excuse me uh
[11:18] Jeremiah 31 35
[11:24] that was a part of the I'm going to turn
[11:27] to that one
[11:28] because I need to read a little bit on
[11:30] that one
[11:35] it was part of the Covenant there was an
[11:38] eight part Covenant that he made with
[11:39] the people Jeremiah did to bringing them
[11:42] back and I think reconstructing the
[11:43] temple was talking about it and uh
[11:54] see 3135
[11:59] there it is
[12:02] let's say at the Lord which giveth the
[12:04] Sun for light by day and the ordinances
[12:07] of the Moon and of the stars for a light
[12:09] by night which divideth the sea which
[12:12] the waters they have Roar the Lord of
[12:14] hosts is his name
[12:17] he's telling you there who's doing all
[12:19] this he kind of reminded me of the time
[12:21] that in job where he was talking about
[12:23] who who uh bonded the claws of Earth
[12:26] together it's the simple little things
[12:28] that we don't always see that this light
[12:30] is shining on at all times to sustain
[12:32] Our Lives
[12:37] and uh
[12:39] to me the more I read in this subject
[12:41] last night the more I just I was I was
[12:43] sitting there going wow I didn't really
[12:45] realize and I should have how much that
[12:48] God has this has been one way he's
[12:50] projected himself to us by shining
[12:53] himself on us with his life
[12:55] I'm gonna go over to Psalms 4
[13:01] .
[13:04] okay
[13:06] and back uh Psalms four and six
[13:10] and when I first started out I said like
[13:13] the number one's truth revelation
[13:16] shows goodness and then it's God's Plan
[13:18] of Redemption I want to read these three
[13:20] John uh Psalms 4
[13:23] 6 7 and 8. first one is to me it it
[13:27] broke it out as the truth there be many
[13:30] that say who will show us any good Lord
[13:34] lift up thou lift up the light of thy
[13:37] kindness upon us
[13:39] thou has put gladness in my heart
[13:43] more than in the
[13:44] time that their corn and their wine
[13:48] increased I will both lay me down in
[13:51] peace and sleep for thy Lord only make
[13:54] us me dwell in safety
[13:56] to me the first one where he said there
[14:00] will be many that say who will show us
[14:03] any good that's the truth
[14:06] part of the life
[14:08] then thou has put down gladness in my
[14:10] heart
[14:12] that's God coming forth with his
[14:14] goodness
[14:15] and then I will both lay me down in
[14:18] peace and sleep
[14:20] let's plan a Redemption
[14:25] because it's playing
[14:28] okay and I want to move on to uh four
[14:32] seven

[15:12] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[15:15] afraid

[15:21] 105.
[15:36] all right everybody ready
[15:39] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[15:43] light unto my path
[15:47] now all of this is from the Old
[15:50] Testament and we don't went through John
[15:52] 1 I'm gonna go to First John 1 5.
[16:18] y'all ready
[16:20] this then is a message which we have
[16:22] heard of him and declaring unto you that
[16:26] God is light and in him is no Darkness
[16:29] at all
[16:30] now I'm gonna go back to Matthew 5 14. I
[16:32] should have went there to start off with
[16:33] but y'all give him something around here
[16:36] a little bit
[16:38] we all know that scripture but I love
[16:40] reading it anyway Matthew what 5 14.

[17:01] y'all know what he he's doing here
[17:04] okay we all the light of the world a
[17:07] city that is set on the on a hill cannot
[17:10] be hid in other words ain't no way you
[17:13] can hide his life when it comes
[17:15] no way
[17:17] neither do men
[17:19] light a candle and put it under a bushel
[17:22] but on a Candlestick and it gives life
[17:25] into all that are in the house let your
[17:29] light so shine before men that they may
[17:32] see your good works and glorify your
[17:35] father which is in heaven
[17:37] that's our job
[17:40] as a Christian
[17:42] to everybody that we meet in here
[17:46] outside the greatest gift is being able
[17:48] to take it from in here hear it get it
[17:51] up here let it come down the yard and
[17:54] take it out there and talk to people out
[17:56] in the world
[17:58] it's not an easy thing some people to do
[18:00] but some people I love to run my mouth a
[18:02] lot I like to talk I love people I get
[18:06] so bored if people don't want to talk to
[18:07] me sometime I go talk to the cats
[18:11] I've got to talk to somebody and I love
[18:14] to tell them about this message and
[18:16] every now and then that was up the other
[18:17] day I was over getting at a doctor
[18:19] getting my back adjusted and the little
[18:22] receptionist was talking to me a little
[18:24] bit and something clicked and said a
[18:26] word and I was able to say two or three
[18:28] things to her right off the bat she
[18:30] stood there with her mouth open
[18:31] and she said I've been going to church
[18:33] all my life and I've never heard that I
[18:34] said well
[18:35] read your Bible I'll show you right
[18:37] where it is
[18:38] and I said the next time I come we'll
[18:40] talk a little bit more about it if you
[18:42] want to
[18:44] I said Lord say never leave us a forsake
[18:46] us so he's here to help us do these
[18:48] things you'd be surprised what you have
[18:50] heard but if you don't talk about it
[18:53] how you going to stay in his environment
[18:55] are you going to stay active with you
[18:59] because we can get stale
[19:01] I believe that
[19:03] and all of us here well have jobs like
[19:06] it's like yesterday I was sitting there
[19:08] we had so many things to do I wanted to
[19:09] go to work by 12 o'clock that was a joke
[19:11] I didn't even get out of my pajamas all
[19:13] day long I was fixing a
[19:15] toilet and some other things at halftime
[19:18] and I did and we had go get a washer and
[19:20] dryer Susan did that and you know I
[19:23] finally got out of the house about six
[19:24] o'clock
[19:25] but you never know how it's gonna work
[19:28] and uh
[19:29] but that's what I was supposed to do
[19:31] yesterday because that's what I did
[19:33] yeah budget we must have really got to
[19:37] somebody else here at the nursing home
[19:38] we already talked about the lower level
[19:39] at a time because you cannot give them
[19:41] too much right and this lady asked for
[19:44] prayer for salvation for her family amen
[19:47] she was crying and crying amen so we
[19:51] must have did something I guess
[19:52] sure did he said we're two or three meet
[19:55] my name there I'll be also
[19:58] we we listen now have you ever been out
[20:01] and you know I I've got to kennel this
[20:04] because this really happened
[20:06] and sister Gene can testify that really
[20:08] happened
[20:09] because it happened to her car
[20:12] I told Brother wait out there one day I
[20:14] was saying something about a little the
[20:15] baby Blazers and I said every time we
[20:17] get one of these things the transmission
[20:18] goes just dies honestly but most time
[20:23] it's the motors but the transmission is
[20:25] just go like that and I said you know
[20:27] what that's what happens to them Blazers
[20:29] I said that for my lips I said it now I
[20:32] drove that car home pulled it down in my
[20:34] driveway this car run perfect
[20:37] what happened to it the very next
[20:39] morning I went to back it out of my
[20:41] driveway I forget what I was doing to it
[20:42] nothing no reverse
[20:46] that's true so listen the point is here
[20:49] I showed the wrong light and my brother
[20:52] got hurt because of it
[20:56] and I asked him to forgive me he must
[20:59] have because I'm still here
[21:01] and sister June is uh checking her head
[21:05] out
[21:06] so I mean we have to be careful we're
[21:10] we're not we're not a people that's
[21:11] that's back in the Old Testament where
[21:14] they just had types
[21:17] they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:19] the light
[21:22] is
[21:24] is for
[21:25] to make us
[21:28] to get to that place
[21:31] for Luke 17 30 can be manifested
[21:34] everything's been laid out for us
[21:37] y'all say that it's all laid out for us
[21:40] you go speaking something that's wrong
[21:42] you have to be careful about what you
[21:44] say to people
[21:46] be real careful because they don't know
[21:49] and uh I know I've done that I've been
[21:51] asked to leave a man's pores because I
[21:53] was telling him too much and I got in my
[21:57] car and it was no labeling you know what
[21:59] it wouldn't crank that wouldn't crank

[22:10] least stand there with him I said listen

[22:17] ain't what we're supposed to do
[22:18] no Christian is ever supposed to hurt
[22:21] nobody

[22:25] there for you and that's my youthful
[22:27] enthusiasm and I I'm sorry I make
[22:30] mistakes too and I just did because I
[22:32] would never ever
[22:34] harm or hinder anybody in any way like

[22:43] here because I said okay brother but I I
[22:47] at least got the man to shake my hand
[22:49] and admit
[22:50] and accept my apology because
[22:54] no no he didn't help me push that car me
[22:58] wasn't gonna come out there and help me
[23:00] do nothing he wanted me off of his
[23:02] driveway out of his yard and this car's
[23:04] gone long long
[23:07] you know I ain't afraid of the guy
[23:10] but this is getting a little bit too
[23:12] funny now I mean you know I know you're
[23:14] I know you got a sense of humor and it's
[23:16] okay I don't mind being on the hot seat
[23:18] because I know everything's okay I
[23:21] really I really shouldn't have done what
[23:22] I did and I apologize to you for doing
[23:25] that because I wouldn't hurt that
[23:26] brother for nothing right
[23:27] uh
[23:32] his his brother-in-law has come up to me
[23:34] and said yeah I said you got him good
[23:35] said he needed that I said no he didn't
[23:39] not like that
[23:40] so caught up in it though Tyler and I
[23:43] both saw the man
[23:44] snap yeah oh yeah he was so caught up
[23:47] and you know he was in the spirit he was
[23:49] trying to tell this man something we saw
[23:51] him snap and and it was like we were
[23:53] just wanting to get out of there because
[23:55] we could see him change
[23:58] but Don was just like you know listen I
[24:01] have no fear I really don't I'm not
[24:04] gonna fear
[24:05] when fear comes climbing up your back
[24:07] that's death creeping up on you folks
[24:11] you got to stand on the word you got to
[24:13] stand there and say this is it
[24:16] buy it Stripes I'm Healed and that's it
[24:18] there ain't nothing else to say
[24:21] yes God didn't do all this for me to get
[24:24] here today and say well maybe that
[24:27] part's good and that part ain't I don't
[24:30] like that part
[24:31] I'm gonna tell Ollie out something right
[24:33] now if I never say another word
[24:35] there ain't nothing in this book that I
[24:37] can't agree with
[24:39] you because it's my book
[24:41] God give it to me
[24:44] everybody here I hope and pray that you
[24:47] have that same enthusiasm in your heart
[24:49] about God's word
[24:51] because there ain't nothing else folks
[24:54] I enjoyed watching cartoons when I was a
[24:56] kid seeing the little devil over here in
[24:59] the little uh little angel over here and
[25:01] see you could understand that
[25:03] because that little that good old guy he
[25:05] always was patient and he was always
[25:07] White
[25:09] they had a little light always and he
[25:12] was always just patient and the old dog
[25:14] could get out there and get hurt he'd
[25:16] say no you need to apologize kick that
[25:19] devil off over in the dirt where he
[25:20] belongs but uh
[25:23] anyway there's just so much I need to go
[25:26] on I'm sorry I didn't want to get off
[25:28] because I get excited y'all forgive me
[25:31] because I love this
[25:33] talking about him was the greatest thing
[25:35] that can ever happen in your life
[25:38] anywhere you are any time when he comes
[25:41] on the scene and starts putting the
[25:43] words in your mouth there's nothing like
[25:45] it
[25:47] Australian gift
[25:49] that he just comes to you and starts
[25:50] speaking I love that
[25:54] there's the evidence
[25:56] because if we don't talk about him the
[25:58] rest of the world ain't talk about him
[25:59] folks
[26:00] go to Walmart and look
[26:03] they shame this world
[26:05] I'm sorry but they did
[26:09] okay let me move on here uh
[26:13] I wanted to thank you we got into
[26:15] Matthew here before we know we're all
[26:17] the light you go to come on into Acts
[26:21] now I asked brother Dell a question
[26:23] the other day
[26:25] I know I gotta hurry but I think I'm
[26:27] gonna get through all this I asked him
[26:29] why in the in the Saturday night class
[26:31] why God
[26:33] came as melchized dick he popped down
[26:36] here sprinkled some dust on him come out
[26:39] his male chest dick and of course there
[26:42] wasn't but one form he could show and
[26:43] it's the same form he had at Calgary
[26:45] right
[26:46] right
[26:47] if I say okay is that right that's right
[26:50] okay uh anyway why did he come that way
[26:54] now I knew that that Abraham was was one
[26:59] percent he was at Cornerstone
[27:01] okay of the prophets that built that
[27:04] pyramid
[27:05] okay then prophets coming down through
[27:08] time that spoke that body into existence
[27:10] and it had to be that way had to be
[27:11] perfectly built all the way through
[27:13] couldn't leave nothing out
[27:15] not one thing okay in the Old Testament
[27:18] because if there had been that body
[27:20] wouldn't have been perfect he couldn't
[27:21] have done what he'd done okay now
[27:26] I asked brother Dale why he did that
[27:29] that way
[27:30] was anything other than that of course
[27:33] they talked for a little while but I I
[27:35] kind of run across something and I'd
[27:37] like to ask him another question
[27:38] but I'm gonna go ahead and ask this I
[27:41] wondered sometimes because Here Comes
[27:43] Paul
[27:44] is
[27:46] he was the messenger of
[27:48] I mean no more books than anybody in
[27:50] this new testament the Lord allowed him
[27:52] to do that used him to do that
[27:54] Here Comes Paul down that road to
[27:56] Damascus and he was struck down by that
[27:58] light right there
[28:02] and
[28:04] I I was I I don't know maybe in my mind
[28:06] sometimes brother Dale knows me thank
[28:08] God he does because he can sift through
[28:10] my thoughts and he will he'll do he'll
[28:12] pull it out of me but I would like to
[28:14] ask him sometimes you know wonder if
[28:16] Paul was walking on that same road that
[28:18] God come down his male chest and walked
[28:20] out there on top of Abraham
[28:22] pretty close wasn't he because of
[28:24] Abraham hung around over there where the
[28:27] where the future home is going to be
[28:29] and that's where God said he would now
[28:31] they do what they want to over they give
[28:34] that land away if they want to it ain't
[28:35] gonna make no difference they ain't
[28:36] theirs and give them
[28:37] never was there's a beginning it ain't
[28:39] gonna be theirs in the end
[28:41] because we already know the plans
[28:43] what's going to happen
[28:45] but anyway I'm gonna ask him that when
[28:48] he gets back
[28:49] uh I want to touch on uh Romans 13 12
[28:53] right quick
[28:56] I hope y'all don't mind me reading all
[28:58] these scriptures I just kind of want to
[28:59] show you throughout this whole Bible
[29:01] there's nothing else you can really what
[29:04] is that at there he did
[29:07] okay
[29:11] uh 13 12.
[29:17] if I can get over to it
[29:23] and then I'm gonna read
[29:24] two things and then we're gonna go
[29:28] here we go
[29:30] almost 13 12. the night is far span and
[29:33] the day is at hand let us therefore cast
[29:36] off the works of darkness we gotta do
[29:38] that that's death during this time and
[29:41] let us put on the armor of light what is
[29:45] the armor of light
[29:47] God's word
[29:49] Gotta Have It
[29:51] I've heard people tell me that they got
[29:53] God living in their heart they got this
[29:55] and they got that
[29:57] I got a guy that's working with us and
[29:59] he does that and he's he says certain
[30:01] things and boy he's smart he comes right
[30:04] down the line and the other day I
[30:05] finally told him I said brother I said
[30:07] I'm going to tell you something I'm kind
[30:09] of like Jacob
[30:11] I lie to you and tell you I got to
[30:13] baptism my Holy Ghost and you're gonna
[30:15] sit back and watch and see what I do but
[30:17] I'll lie about it because I want it that
[30:19] bad
[30:20] I want it I'll confess it and I'll keep
[30:22] doing it until God does come and give it
[30:25] to me because if you don't confess it
[30:27] you ain't gonna get it because if you
[30:29] can't speak it like bad Transmissions if
[30:31] they can speak that we can speak the
[30:33] other things right
[30:36] and that's the way I look at that
[30:38] because you have to be able our word is
[30:41] who we are and what we are inside he
[30:44] said if it comes across these lips
[30:45] that's where it is I want to read one
[30:48] more right here
[30:49] I'm gonna go to
[30:51] I want to show up one other thing here
[30:53] on the book that
[30:55] to the message of the hour that we are
[30:58] showing that the light was here brother
[31:00] Brown I'm sorry I've got quotes in here
[31:02] I wanted to read but I didn't get to
[31:04] read them on him
[31:06] um
[31:08] anyway if I get to it
[31:11] y'all be turning to Revelations 21 23.
[31:14] here's the seven Church ages that shows
[31:18] what
[31:19] Darkness and Light
[31:22] okay
[31:24] wouldn't have been no light
[31:28] at that Prophet not came God not seen
[31:31] him wouldn't have been on this last
[31:32] stage y'all it would have been done
[31:35] I don't know
[31:36] God God wasn't going to let that happen
[31:39] but that's the reason he sent that
[31:40] profit he had to come and bring us this
[31:42] okay got that now Revelations 21 23
[31:49] this I really really really really like
[31:54] 21 23. okay
[32:00] what a gift
[32:01] what we're looking for
[32:04] and it all ends up from you go back in
[32:07] Genesis one where he was the light to
[32:10] hear and the city had no need of the Sun
[32:15] neither of the Moon
[32:17] shine in it well the glory of God did
[32:21] lighten it and the lamb is the light
[32:24] thereof
[32:28] what a promise
[32:31] what a truth
[32:34] brother Branham
[32:37] that Lake of Fire
[32:39] hanging over you
[32:41] took a little Jewish boy from that's
[32:43] just to take his picture
