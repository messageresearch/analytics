go on friday any of you need to stay over you can stay with each you know all we can put people up for friday into saturday also remember september the 25th and the 26th brother andrew glover will be here we'll have our regular youth meeting on that saturday starting at about three-ish and we'll have our regular service just like we did with brother hyde a couple of of weeks ago and invite youth to come and we'll have questions and answers we'll have food for the young people and we will get more with you as we go on as to who needs to help um in that so all minds clear if you've got your bibles let's turn to the book of hebrews i know marshall and john's not used to these long services so if it'll be okay listen if jesus christ can hang on a cross for three hours with nails in his hand beat like hamburger meat we can set for a two-hour service he saved my soul doing that hey man maybe this will save yours hebrews 9 verse 11. let's pray before we get started heavenly father we pray today lord number one that you'll bless this girl named angie lord in this school father we know that the devil's a cruel person and he uses people lord i pray that that devil will can will stop doing what he's doing to this little girl and that you'll cover him lord as brother bob said lord the angels are encamped about those that believe you father so i know this little girl needs you lord and we pray that you'll put those angels around her lord and that bullying part will stop lord we know you're a god that comes on the scene lord if we ask because we're your children we're not as the angels where you created them for worship but lord you created us to be your children sons and daughters of god to live on the earth and i what as brother ernie always said we're we're a supernatural being come down here to have a human experience and lord this experience lord is what's going to carry us through father we pray now that you'd be with each one that's under the sound of my voice heal the sick lord be with the ones that are sick be with the brother jim babb's family there lord and happy valley that passed on lord we pray that you comfort them comfort that church lord as they're going through a battle we pray that you comfort each of your bride around the world lord that you'll be with each one may we continue this service lord under the leadership of the holy spirit in jesus name we pray amen now we've been on this this is part 31 so i'm going to have to background just a little bit for the new ones that are here so uh let's read hebrews 9 verse 11. now the whole theme of the of the service is going to be eternal redemption all right because we needed redeeming we were lost undone come to the world speaking lies part of the devil's economy amen right and then we had to be redeemed we had to be called back or we had to be taken out of the pawn shop we had to be pulled up out of the mire in the muck and who did it jesus christ but christ being coming high priests of good things to come by greater and more perfect tabernacle you like that marshall you can see that it's got big letters not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us now remember he was the eternal one but his body was not eternal his body had to die as a sacrifice according to the old testament in isaiah 53 that he gave his soul a ransom but he gave his body as a sacrifice he was the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world all right let's go to revelations 11 verse 3 because we're going to talk about the two witnesses i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred 203 score days which is 1260 days clothed in sackcloth now let's go to isaiah 65 i hope we'll get to this this afternoon isaiah 65 verse 17 says be behold i create a new heavens and a new earth how many of your new creatures in christ amen old things are passed away behold all things have become new for behold i created new heavens and a new earth listen we're not going to live on this sin soaked earth all of our life this thing's going to be renovated it's going to be changed and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind you may be seated in the lord add his blessing to the reading of word now as we continue this let's go to matthew 16 and we'll start right here because jesus told us he said he went they wanted to know lord who are you and he said well i uh you know they said well you were jeremiah and you were one of the prophets and some of the people calling him belzebub and some called him this and some called him that jesus said well who do you say that i am in other words his followers the very people that was with him he asked him said whom say ye that i am and simon peter that peter i like peter he pops up and speaks a lot right thou art to christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock listen a lot of people think that the church is built on peter the catholic church says peter's the first pope yet they won't let popes have wives and peter had a wife because jesus healed his mother-in-law pretty sensible so it wasn't peter and then upon a rock it's not a rock god's not built upon a rock but what is it it's a revelation rock means revelation upon this revelation i will build my church not the church nominal but the church the the people that are the living sons and daughters of god in the gates of hell is going to be here but it won't prevail against us that's what we're looking at now the gates of hell is going to be here then the bible says there's no weapon formed so there's going to be a weapon that is formed that can stand against this word of god that's why we believe to get back to the word of god stay in the word of god and the word of god will tell us what we're doing and like bob was talking today we're not scared of prophets because amos 2 3 and 7 says the lord wants to do nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophets all right so men have problems with prophets i don't have a problem with them but if we didn't have prophets you wouldn't have a bible the only problem is the prophet we believe came in the end time was so contrary to all the others but wasn't jesus very contrary to all the kind of anyway they called him belgium and he was god so now let's look around here and see he said i'll build my church that's okay no go ahead he said i'll build my church jesus didn't say i'll let you build your church he said i'll build my church on this revelation of the son of god which the son of god is what god in spirit form that came on the day of pentecost right the baptism of the holy ghost jesus said i'll send you a comforter in my name so it wasn't another person it was the same guy just immorphied into another form called the baptism of the holy ghost fell on 120 in the upper rim according to the book of acts right and so i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world not just with you i'll be in you to the end of the world but then we look at the he says now he kept calling himself son of man son of man and i was talking to brother rush yesterday and i want you to get this real good and it may be foreign for some but that's okay but remember the wise virgins that we used as an analogy a couple of sundays ago the wise virgins is what they got oil they got the holy ghost right remember there was ten of them five were wise and five were foolish the five wise virgins went to heaven the five foolish virgins stayed on earth because when the bridegroom called the five woke up and they had oil the oil is what signifies the holy ghost all right don't get scared it is a ghost but it's holy some people have ghosts and they're not so holy so but if you got the holy ghost that's god himself so they got the holy ghost though so that made them children of god the wise virgins had oil in their lamp they got ready to go but now remember the foolish virgins didn't go because they didn't have oil in their lamp right oil signified the holy ghost so they didn't get the holy ghost sure they might have been good church members because they were virgins amen they were virgins but they did not continue on with god and take further revelation of what god had for your day not luther's day not wesley's day not pentecostal's day not even yesterday but today amen it's a today god he's the same yesterday today and forever so the son of god down to the church ages that's what jesus said i'll build my church on that and then a foolish virgin is going to come up and they're going to what they're going to be given eternal life but they didn't get it here something caused them not to get the holy ghost in other words they may sit in a church where it says well you just need to shake hands or you just need to shake somebody or you just need to speak in tongues we don't believe if that's all there is to it it's the life behind it amen live me a sermon don't worry about preaching it live it so we were discussing yesterday but remember there's a part that we're going to skip to where we see that paul says we which are alive and remain now see that's a different group alive means you don't have to be resurrected now i'm telling you what the bible says i believe there's a group of people that's going to stand on this earth and death will not have a hold on them amen and we can believe it's you if you want to i'm just dumb enough to believe it's me all right i'm just dumb enough to believe it well me okay thank you but paul says i'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep that's a mystery a mystery had to be brought to us by a prophet we didn't get this by our own intelligence i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep what we're gonna somebody's gonna stand and be alive but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye to last trump for the trumpet shall sound it's not it's not it's not brother paul picking up a trumpet and somebody's going to walk out in the middle of the graveyard that's too obvious i thought this was going to be a secret i thought this was going to be a secret catching away i thought he was going to come as a thief in the night to come and get us and the graves are not going to be opened as they say open and you're not going to go out there and see a mound of dirt thrown off i know that's silly but people believe that you know the only reason jesus rolled the the stone off was to show me and you that he came out i mean in a glorified body i believe he stepped through a wall about several hours after he was resurrected he just walked right through a wall so he didn't have to pull that stone away but remember the seal of death was broke so he had to signify to the world that that seal was open and he stepped out and said all power in heaven earth has been given unto me all right everybody with me and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed changed from what changed from these vile bodies that we are and to young people as abraham and sarah were changed back to have children that's another great mystery that we see in the bible for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality and we see that god by this eternal redemption we know that by the baptism of the holy ghost you and i are now eternal in our soul sitting in heavenly places with christ jesus but this thing's not this is the one you got to work on or we're going to have to do the ashes to ashes dust to dust thing everybody got that because we're heading toward a grave we're heading toward it i didn't say we had to get in it i said we're heading toward it because there's going to be somebody now read your bible roll it back down and we shall not all sleep so there had to be a message come not above and beyond man's comprehension but above and beyond man's comprehension you understand what i mean because how many people's heard we're all gonna die you all gonna die we all gonna die well somebody is and they do it every day but somebody is gonna have to fulfill this first corinthians 15. and then another scripture where he says we shall he says we alive we which are alive and remain to the coming the lord shall not what prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet of god there is that trumpet again now what is a trumpet as we look and see trumpet trumpet is a message what does a trumpet do it sounds a battle it actually gives you communication back when there was no communication you know the old indians used to do the smoke signals but back when there was a trumpet there was a certain sound that a trumpet made to either charge or retreat because your battleground was spread out all over miles and you couldn't communicate that quick but if you blew that trumpet and it was the right sound you knew what to do you'd have to have somebody you knew what to do when you heard when you heard the message you did what the trumpet said so that's what we're not looking for we're not looking for a trumpet that stands out outside in a in a graveyard into dootin and you see this arm push up out of the no come on that's silly that's old wives tales it has no foundation in the bible i promise you that so now let's go to revelations 4 1. try to hurry through this but i want to kind of background a little bit because now that we see i tell you what pulls chart up the first chart not the daniel 70 which chart pulled the first chart up that i did a long time ago and this is what we're looking at now just pull it up just there you go so we got jesus resurrected he goes to hell and preached to the souls in prisons according to matthew 27. all right now he's here for 40 days acts one verse three what happens jesus ascends he takes that glorified body up into another dimension right then he sends not the body back he sends the holy spirit back that was the motivator inside of him he sends it back on the day of pentecost they're buying all right with that amen what'd i tell y'all about amen when we got visitors sometimes you say stuff and they're like nobody says hey man and the visitors are going they don't believe what he's saying either but we do i know you do you wouldn't be sitting here every sunday if you didn't hey man okay what that's what i thought goodness gracious we need to go hannah can you come teach this class it's like kindergarten okay so he says the holy ghost back on the day of pentecost and it's the new birth because your first birth was wrong amen you needed a new birth he said nicodemus you must be born again from where above not from your mom and daddy because look what he said in his carnal mind i got to go back and get in my mama's womb and be birthed again jesus said no that's your problem you came out the first time right but you need to be birthed from above and that's what happened on the day of pentecost 120 little sons of god i'll build my church jesus said on this rock revelation i'll bribe i'll build my church to revelation that god did come back not as the third person of a trinity sorry no such thing in the bible we don't believe that cutting him up in three pieces it was the same person in the form of the holy ghost and what in the believers as bob was talking about then then you've got people that are that are not angels with wings you've got earthly angels that come down and preach a sermon that come down according to revelations one two and three that you see ephesus smyrna pergamus thytara and and well know that that we know more about wesley and lutheran wesley and and the prophet in the end time than we do all these others but remember they had to be here because of the gentile church age is everybody okay with that well there is a gentile listen god's not dealing with the jews at the moment now he may be dealing with them individually and birthing them in the body of christ as born-again christians but not as the nation of israel paul said blindness in part right has come to israel until the gentile nations in other words be gathered together and we take a rapture just like we're going to read here in revelations 4 1. so after the church ages are over excuse me there's going to be a resurrection and then after that resurrection then what are we going to have according to revelations 4 1. let's go to there now this is john on patmos he said after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were a trumpet talking with me said come up hither see there's no word there's no rapture word in the bible it's catching away or coming up all right remember rapture is ecstasy or the epitome of what something is going on the rapture is going to happen because we come up because we're raptured out of this out of this age come up hither look and i will show these things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and three sat on the throne what'd that say one said on the throne amen one said on the throne all right so now the church age is over the bride's in glory according to the bible we don't go through the tribulation y'all have y'all forgot what i just said a minute ago hard group today so let's go back to the chart so we've been raptured so we're out of here so now what happens is god turns where according to revelations 7 is that right according to revelation 7. in revelations 11 he gets two witnesses right here there's two prophets see we're not scared of prophets they're good for us revelations 11 there's two prophets there's two prophets that come on the scene but let's go to matthew 24 21 because when the church leaves now when the bride leaves god is going to turn to the jews according to revelations 11 right all right so that's what's going to happen and what's going to happen to the foolish virgin remember the foolish virgin had to stay here because the bridegroom call came the the wise virgins left left the foolish virgins here and there was weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth that's right amen so it wasn't a really nice place that they found themselves in because they didn't have the holy ghost okay and then what god does is he removes himself from the gentile church and he goes and opens the eyes of the jews because he promised to in revelation 11. but now let's go to back to the chart i mean let's go back to matthew go to the next one now the tribulation now watch this is matthew 24 this is jesus speaking he says for then shall be great tribulation now look we have tribulation every day this this virus and all this stuff and work is tribulation some of you that don't have to go to work tomorrow but we have tr we have tribulation but not a great tribulation this great tribulation is the wrath of god poured out upon a sinning world they're sinning now with us in it but the reason that god's not pouring out his complete wrath is because what his bride's here his children are still here amen i mean we're still here but once we leave he's only going to deal with 144 000 right the whole world is going to be in chaos they're just going to start well it'll be a lawless world you know man's good as long as there's a law because without a law for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened thank god there should be no flesh be saved for the elect say those days shall be shortened so who's the elect us we're the elect of god we're the ones that are holding off the wrath of god and we once we get out of here though it's not going to hold the wrath of god and it's going to be let's go to revelation 2. we'll see now jesus is talking he says now because remember on the isle of patmos john was commissioned to write what he saw all right and then the one standing in the midst of the golden candle sticks like unto the son of man he was the one that was talking to john who was that that was jesus christ all right notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman jezebel who called herself a prophetess remember she elevated herself in israel and ahab was just as bad as she was but watch what this is because remember a woman is a type of the what church always a woman is the type of the church in the bible this woman jezebel which calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication now look that's not natural you take any other doctrine besides the true doctrine of the bible you're committing fornication that's what the bible says and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and i gave her space to repent how long did he give her 2 000 years 2 000 years to repent of all the junk that we went through i mean god's not this confused but look what happened she repented not the church nominal repented not behold i who's i god jesus christ i will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repented their deeds you've still got a little chance left amen so let's go to revelation 13 4. now this is what's going to happen the way we see it according to the bible after we leave that this is what's going to happen and they worship the dragon now it's not a dragon it's a symbol of a person with some authority and power which gave power into the beast it's not some big beast standing up there listen folks let me tell you something all these analogies that we see in the bible now probably uncle marshall could go through them better than i could but that's not going to be a beast like a beast like an animal it's it's a symbol of a person with power everybody got that because remember what does a horn mean in the bible power what does water in the bible mean many people tongues and nations so god is using these symbols and they worship the beast it must be one person saying who is locking to the beast who is able to make war with him so there somebody's going to rise up and listen he's not going to look like a beast he's a slicker uncle john satan is not a red guy with a tail he's met a few maybe but he's a slick guy he's deceived everybody but just a few a little group of people a deceiver is somebody that's so close to the very thing that you're worshiping remember he wanted to be like god then he says in the temple as god in the end as the beast that has power because who's going to be able to make war with him we're talking about this whole world who's going to be able to make war with this guy and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things in blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue how long 42 months how long is that three and a half years same time that the two witnesses are preaching their gospel to the 144 thousand that's right and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against god into blasphemous name and his tabernacle on them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given unto him over all kindred tongues and nations this guy's pretty powerful and he's a slicker though he's going to bring you into not the bible say with flattery oh it's just come to my church it'll be all right wait a minute you did stop and all that dwell upon the earth look all right amen can i get it amen and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him not god whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world all will worship this man thinking he's a religious head of something you can call it the pope or whatever whoever you want to call it i don't care we're not going to be here to see it we're going to be gone amen we're going to be out of here we're not going to worry about this because everybody else is going to be deceived by him look except those whose names are written the ones that are not written is going to be deceived the ones that's names in the book of life which is what the genesis 21 26 person his own children all right let's go to revelation 3 now and see what happens now god says and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth now how long is that three and a half years you say no that don't add up remember god's calendar is 30 days not 31 and 29 and 28. god's calendar's 30 day calendar all right so 30 days into that will be three and a half years 42 months these are the two olive trees now what olive always is israel the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire now listen they're not fire breathing dragons what is fire god's anointing that what they say is going to come to pass fire proceeded out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed remember i said before don't you think these two witnesses are going to pop on the scene people hate israel anyway they're going to really hate them when we leave but these two witnesses are going to stand right in the middle of that and they're going to preach jesus christ and the mossad the fbi the kgb the cia they're all going to want to kill these two men and you know what they're going to try because if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to what shut heaven now who shut heaven in the days of the old testament one more time thank you elijah that it rained not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn into blood what man turned into blood let everybody else talk okay you're right up here in the front it's always the kids in the front oh but no who turned the water to blood moses all right so so the spirit of moses and elijah will not be the two men it will be the spirit of moses and elijah that will go to because listen whether we believe in prophets or not israel surely believes in them they are looking for elijah according to malachi 4 before the great and terrible day of the lord they're looking for an elijah to show up and as i preached a long time ago remember that they put a cup when they have their sedar or the end of their year they put a cup there and it's not not got anything in it but they're waiting on elijah to show up they go out in the yard and they look this way and they look this way and if they don't see a man walking down the road it looks like elijah they take the cup put it back up on the shelf and say until next year so they're looking for elijah so when this man comes on the scene that's able to shut the heaven their mind is going to go back to that old testament they're going to say elijah is finally here but they're going to think the messiah is coming to get them right but remember they were blinded and messiah's already come but the revelation is going to be when god pulls the veil off of israel's eyes because blindness was given to them in part for me and you but when they start doing this the whole world's going to see it but there's going to be 144 000 and we'll read that here in just a minute or maybe i took that out but remember the bible says that there's a 12 000 out of each tribe 12 times 12 is hold on 12 times 12 is what you got it right she didn't hear what she didn't hear what i said the other day so that's okay yeah 144 000 12 000 out of each tribe and when they shall have finished their testimony in other words after 42 months the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war now it's not going to beast is not going to climb out of a pit you understand what i mean it's that man that's been in power the whole time but he's he can't kill them because of the 1260-day prophecy right but once that 1260-day prophecy is over the anointing comes off the two witnesses and he is able to what kill him all right so he's going to kill them all right so now let's go to daniel 9 verse 24. we might not get to the millennium today that's okay daniel 9 24 remember the book of daniel it's the same as the book of revelations to me and you the book of daniel is the same prophecy that gives israel their prophecy in the end time 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things finish the transgression of who israel this is not me and you we're already gone all right to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy so there's 70 weeks and we know instead of going through all the whole long dissertation it wasn't 70 exact weeks it was 70 times 7 which is 490 years and it's kind of strange that that a man looked at jesus one time and says how many times do i need to forgive my brother seven times jesus said 70 times seven which is 490 years that's how long he give for israel to repent everybody good with that amen thank you sister so now what are they going to go through though let's stop for a minute so they're going to be 70 weeks to determine we know that 69 weeks is already over with there's one week left there was a gentile church age put in between there all right because god's not dealing with the jews as a nation now none at all right not at all he's only dealing with with the gentiles but when he leaves the gentile goes to the jews they're going to those two prophets prophesy 1260 days according to the bible and but what's going to happen during that time let's go to the next go to the next scripture which is jeremiah 30 verse 7 and i kind of flew through this wednesday night and i'll kind of stop just a minute it says the last for that great day day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble now this bible talks about who was jacob he's a jew jacob was jew all right now remember what does jacob's name mean in the bible shyster remember his name was changed to israel because he wrestled with god just like me and you get a name changed when we wrestle with god and wrestle without get the new birth we're called christians all right so it is even the time of jacob's trouble because he was a shyster remember he stole the birthright he did all those things wrong when he was a young guy look he was a he was a con man of the con man him and his him and his father-in-law laban were the two of the best con men they couldn't go to las vegas they'd kick them out because they conned each other the whole time i mean jacob had to con him to get lea to get rachel and work seven years and and somehow laban slipped leon somehow i don't know how that happened but then he had to marry her and then he had to work seven more years so anyway you see jacob's trouble but look but he shall be saved out of it now we can go into the old testament and we did how many times god told israel said i've divorced you you've went whoring you've done other things that you're not you've you've worshipped other gods you've moloch and and and bell elbow bell bell and all those they worship those people right so god said i'm gonna put you away but i'm not gonna forget you you're my people you're the one i started with you're my people i'm not going to deny you or get rid of you but you're going to go through jacob's trouble you're going to go through persecution just like when we do something wrong as a christian what do we go through persecution amen but he shall look but here's the promise but he shall be saved out of it how by the two witnesses going to preach to 144 000 in israel and save them from their sins they're going to preach what jesus christ a jesus christ that they've already crucified because remember they said and i think i took it out but remember they say where'd you get those scars he said in the house of my friends so they mourn and just like when jacob revealed i mean when joseph was it revealed himself to his brothers all right for it shall come to pass in that day now we're reading the bible saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst our bonds and the stranger shall no more serve themselves of him remember what did god tell him he said i'm going to because we're going to read this in a minute god said israel i'm going to stat scatter you all over the world right i'm going to destroy your temple remember the temple was destroyed like 16 different times every time they'd build it somebody tear it down because they hated them jews listen they knew if those jews had a temple god was going to come to that temple so if they destroyed the temple they didn't have to destroy the people they had to destroy they destroyed the temple but look at them so he dispersed them but they they're back now in their homeland remember but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king who i will raise up unto them therefore fear they are not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity when he dispersed the jews he sent them into all nations right then russia kicked them out then germany tried to kill them all the only thing they feel safe over here is because we don't persecute them like like the other people do but they're rich people the jews are rich people inherently they just they're they're business people and the world hates them because they got money i mean really look you read about hitler hitler really didn't hate the jews for being a jew they hated the jews because he had all they had all the money and he was trying to fund his campaign of war and they said you can fund it all you want to but you're not using our money so that's okay he said i'll just kill you and take it that's what he did six million of them and jacob shall return and shall be in rest we're heading into the millennium which is a rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make look every nation is going to that battle of armageddon according to the bible according to daniel you've got the ten kingdoms that come together under this one head of whoever you want to call him pope or whoever which is the beast and they're going to be they're going to be very powerful and try to take over the world but look god said look do i make full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee in other words he's going to make full end to the united states russia china yet will i not make full end of thee what a promise but i will correct the in measure and will not leave the altogether unpunished he hadn't look how the jews have been persecuted since they hung him on a cross by the millions they've been killed just because they're jews that's why i thank god in the fifth seal that there's a fifth sealed jew that's given eternal life given white robes for their stand of who they are they'll be okay with that it's the word you got that right now look let's go to revelation 6 verse 12. and i think we'll we'll continue this afternoon we got plenty of time this afternoon not so much this morning but we hadn't even got to the tribulation we got part of the tribulation now look now beheld when he had opened the sixth seal now this is the bible although there was a great earthquake the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth now we've not seen the day like that have we no no okay and the stars of heaven fell into the earth and even as a fig tree cast as her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together sounds like some kind of nuclear something didn't it and every mountain and ireland were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains we look up to all these people and that's okay to give honor where owners do but just because bill gates has got 70 something billion dollars that don't make him a christian he's going to be a part of this group right here if he don't get if he don't if he don't repent let's just be let's just be real we all going to come to a place where nothing you got here is going to do you any good except what's inside of you amen and the mighty men and every bondman and every freeman they hid themselves in dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne there's that one sitting on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand who shall be able to stand there's nobody going to be able to stand let's read revelations let's let's skip the let's skip that quote let's go to revelation 7 verse 1. now watch and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth now what does winds mean in the bible war they're holding the four wars that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea or any tree and i saw another angel ascend from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees in other words there's not going to be a last war until those 144 000 are sealed we think we've been through we've been through world war one world war ii korea vietnam the skirmish that was over in afghanistan to different places but they're looking at a battle of armageddon it's going to destroy everything and god's not going to let that happen until we leave and the 144 000 leave because look i'm going to take what he promised he said till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads now remember we talked about last week about the mark of the beast the mark of the beast is not the virus the mark of the beast is not the shot the mark of the beast is not a tattoo the mark of the beast is in your forehead it's your attitude toward god in his word amen you know i'm going to find this 666 tattooed somewhere on everybody's body are they gonna i remember when when the barcodes came out years ago everybody say oh that's the mark of the bees no the mark of the beast is that beast that's going to make you think you're so religious and you're worshiping the devil amen and without the holy ghost you're still worshipping him now i don't i'm not going to get loud i got older people in the building i'm trying to i'm conserving my energy this afternoon i may let loose but i heard the number of them which were sealed now what is sealed the baptism of the holy ghost right remember grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption so he has to seal the 144 000 preach a message to him through two prophets they accept jesus christ they know that they killed him two thousand years ago they said oh we're in so much big trouble and what does two witnesses say don't worry it was done to preserve life it was done to preserve the gentile bride now they're gone now we're gonna preach salvation to you a hundred and forty four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel all right so that has nothing to do with gentiles that's right that's the two witnesses preaching 1260 days and they're going to seal 144 000 because remember god doesn't deal with israel as individuals that's right he deals with israel as a nation he deals with gentiles as individuals tom many tongues nations you're going to read in many a couple of scriptures we're going to read not now but later on where there's this multitude of people comes up and they said john who is these people he said i don't know and the angel said well i know who it is he says the ones come out of tribulation the ones just give their life for god and all these different things because you know what john didn't know because he was a jew they were the gentile church age all right everybody okay with that all right let's go right here and then we'll stop what's the next one all right so let's stop we're gonna we'll do this and then we'll stop right here magicians get ready to come and he's he who's this he all right according to the according to what we we read in the bible am i okay with that according to what we read in the bible god will never break a covenant god cannot break a covenant he's a covenant maker we're the covenant breaker right he made a covenant with god in the old testament i mean he made a covenant with adam in the old testament he said eat that tree don't eat that one you eat this one you'll live you eat that when you'll die right now who broke the covenant god didn't man went over there and ate that tree and got and god said okay you broke your covenant now you're going out to die but what do you do with abraham though he said abraham i will so it's an unconditional covenant that's what me and you live under now is an unconditional covenant by grace are you saved through faith all right so this he person right here is going to break this covenant because look he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week which one week equals seven years and in the midst of the week in three and a half years that he's that he's letting these two witnesses preach because he can't do nothing about it because the bible says he's not going to do anything about it he can't because they got an anointing on them right so in the midst of the week which what's in the midst of seven three and a half he shall cause the sacrifice an oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate who's this he that's the antichrist that's the beast that's the pope that's to whoever you want to call him he comes in and says i'm israel says no you're not he says i'll show you i'm god and he'll perform signs and wonders and everybody that's not sealed of those 144 000 will just fall right in line amen because without the baptism of the holy ghost you're serving the devil anyway i don't care who you are there's not no gray area in god you're either born again or you're not amen for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even until the consummation what is the consummation that whole last week of daniel 70 weeks if 69 weeks was before at calvary then there's one week left for the jews we're in the middle of it now this is where we're at we're in the middle of it now they prophesied three and a half years and then they're killed in the streets of jerusalem remember we read that last sunday let's read it now revelations 11 7 and we'll stop right there and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom where our lord was crucified where was he crucified jerusalem all right and they of the people and all kindred and tongue and nations shall see now this probably was hard for john to write because john didn't have cnn nbc cbs fox news reuters right because the whole world is going to see their dead bodies laying in that street the whole world's going to hate these two witnesses so bad until as soon as they die they're not even going to bury them so they're desecrating their body they're leaving them there for three and a half days three and a half what three and a half days and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the grave and look and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make mary these people are crazy they just killed two men showed it to the whole world and you see them laying there and i'm sure the cameras are turned on them but here comes god he always comes on the scene and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make mary and shalt send gifts one to another they hated them because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth but now remember they didn't torment 144 000. so the 144 000 is not in this group that's pro that's persecuting these two witnesses i believe they're being persecuted too you and i both do believe that and after three days and a half the spirit of life from god enters into them and they stand on their feet boy six o'clock news oh buddy yeah and they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them what do we read in revelations 4 come up hither in other words they're going to take a rapture they're going to get off the earth and they ascended up to heaven and the cloud and their enemies beheld them now if you continue reading musicians come if you'll continue reading there was a great earthquake after that that destroyed a bunch of stuff and then all heck's going to break loose for the battle of armageddon we'll talk about that this afternoon you love the lord let's stand to our feet let's sing a song if you have a need god bless you thank you for all you all that come and uh you welcome anytime we have service at two o'clock this afternoon if you want to come back because we have a lot
