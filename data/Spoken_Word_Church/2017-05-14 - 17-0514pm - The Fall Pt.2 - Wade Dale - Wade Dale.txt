Description:
GENESIS 1:26-28
»     26     †      ¶  And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
»     27     †     So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
»     28     †     And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

«  99       †        Let me, before we go any farther, go back, Genesis 1:26. I'll pick it up Wednesday. When God made man... Before He made man, He called Himself "El," E-l, El; E-l-h, "Elah," "Elohim." The word means, in the Hebrew, "the self-existence," all by Himself. Nothing existed before Him. He was all the existence there ever was, self-existence One: "El, Elah, Elohim," means the "all-sufficient, all-powerful, Almighty, self-existence One." Oh.
«  100       †        But in Genesis 2, when He made man, He said, "I am Y-a-h-u, J-u-v-u-h, Yahua, Jehovah. What did it mean? "I am the all-existence One Who has created something off of Myself to be a son of Mine, or a temporary, or an amateur little one of Mine

«  21       †        Now, if God created man in His Own image and in His Own likeness, what kind of a man did He create? A spirit man. Now, if you'll notice, after He had made all the creation and created a spirit man (the close reading of this now, to the one that asked the question will find this), that God give dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man. But in His making up there, He made man in His Own image to lead the cattle...

he's had so many mamas over here on this church till uh hello he but you know what he's in the image of his parents you know what we're still talking about now we being in the image of the Almighty God but like brother Louie said good have our visitors with us which are not anymore the pageant's could good to see you fine folks I must close to Murfreesboro North Kerala I mean North Carolina Murfreesboro Tennessee hey brother Joseph Harmons church so good to see them if you got your Bibles let's go ahead and turn right back to where we were last Sunday the Genesis 1:26 and we'll continue on the thought and we're still speaking on the fall fall of man if we can if we can get this going in the right direction we can maybe see where property God said we see where we come from see what we're doing here and see where we're going is that right all right so that's what we're going to try to do is to see where we come from because jesus said I came from God and go back to God right and if you have the same God inside to use and you must have to be able to say I come from God and I go back to God and man cuz that's where that we see this man has come into the image of God not the man you're looking at now right the man you're looking at now but if you're born again it's the one inside of you that looks just like on a night I got a revelation today we're all going to get one of these and second service you're going to sit there and twist it and turn it the whole service that way if you fall asleep it will hit the floor and you'll be embarrassed but if you hold over to this thing and you start spinning it we're going to make one that says Amen when it goes around we just at the head man Amen amen brother patient sometimes these people go to the Land of Nod and they nod off a little bit so it's kind of weird us having service at two o'clock though because we do eat and then we kind of sit down and sometimes we have to do a little Jericho March to get everybody wait but that's okay let the Word of God make you excited and you'll not have to go to sleep Genesis 1:26 verse 20 through 28 and let's bow our heads before we get started the Lord Jesus we pray today Lord that you would come among us in a special way take care of the ones that are sick once you're lost once it needs you father we pray today Lord that you'd be the preeminent one in this building father be the preeminent one in our hearts and our minds you take over the service Lord and you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the hearing Lord just take care of the ones that are not here Lord the ones that are traveling many many of us are the congregation or with their mothers or traveling with their family great it should be with em father and give them traveling mercy be with the ones Lord in the foreign fields the missionaries give them Lord fruit for their labor we pray that you just be with each one that's here's our visitors Lord to speed with them give them strength Lord as they journey back home and may they stay as the ones on the master today our heart has burned because we've talked to the Lord Jesus Christ along the way through the bride of Jesus Christ we thank you for all things add your many blessings to what we're fixing to read Lord we know it's already blessed but bless us Lord as we listen to what you're saying in Jesus name Amen the Bible says Genesis 1:26 is and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and God create so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them so there's some plurality going on here and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth I want you to watch this because we're not going to go back to it maybe but if you're watching just a few minutes if we have time when God created the animals he told them to multiply and replenish and then it was a period now when this image was formed it was in the image of God and he said be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion and man he didn't give the animals dominion over the earth he gave this man he's talking about he gave him dominion over the earth and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated in lore that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to not only for the sake of the visitors but we're going to back up just a minute on what we were talking about last Sunday if you would pull up the Hebrew lexicon because a lot of people have a problem when you say created when he comes to God but you got to remember I'm going to read you here in a minute we read it last Sunday where brother branham's did God's first creation with himself and boy that the theologians sitting in the in the congregation that day probably brother Larry was looking cross-eyed and wondered what book he got out of how God created God you know you but you know what that's what's the property God said and that's what we're going to look at here in just a minute is we're going to see that he didn't he didn't create as in from nothing to something like he did the earth remember faith is the substance Lewis was reading it Wednesday night phases substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not see things were forms of things that weren't seen but now look and like I was showing him back here now he preached on the light but if you'll read over there in Genesis 3 it says and God said let there be light he didn't create that light that light never had a beginning and that light never had an end that light is not the light of the Sun or the light of the moon that was the light of God a man so he didn't create that that was always there now what what we're doing is is we're coming to a place now to where we see more of this eternal God and we're able to understand him that all right God listen let me give you this real revelation God does not need to understand God he is who he is you and I need to understand who God is and he wants us to and you say well I would have done in a different way well then you would have been gone but this is the only way God had for us right here and we must go this way because you know why he saw somebody wouldn't understand him in this form a man's alright alright so now look we know that word create is something that we as human beings we look at something we said God created this man in his own image and in his likeness what we think well he had a beginning any have you know anything has a beginning has got to have an end but no let's look at this word shape or form because really like what we're talking about last Sunday all the elements in the earth nothing ever came from the moon or the Stars everything that you see on the earth all this within the Garden of Eden this can just would by generation generation back generations if this would I'm beating on today you know what's good about God God can tell you where this piece of wood came from and what tree it was in when he created it in the Garden of Eden a man what a mighty God we serve but this was in the Garden of Eden but what did man do man took plastic metal rubber hello and created a car now they didn't create it like we we think create from nothing no gods only one who can do that but when he put it on earth he made man a lesser God and man put all these elements together and created or formed a car so a car was in the Garden of Eden brother Graham said television was in the Garden of Eden amen then all right I believe Moses looked at a television one of these big 16 inch high-definition television Moses was watching what happened in the garden hey man is that all right because he saw he had to see what was going on - real - write that down but here we see God he created man let us make man in our own image after our likeness now if God looked like an animal then we must look like an animal but God was a man wait a minute there's no was in God God is a man and God forever will be a man a man that's why I am that's why you use that phrase I am why I am I am 60 million years ago and I am 60 million years this way I am because it's ever-present see what this God is doing though he is unfolding himself so that we can understand what he is and then look this law says that creation he God created man this word comes from creators of new conditions and circumstances the property God told us he said God was self existent and then all of a sudden out of that God come what an attribute hey man that all right grab one of these and start spinning them an attribute comes out and it's not a different part of God it's God made manifest in another form a man called the logos not the second person of the Trinity or the third or not even the first brother Thomas thank you very much you don't have no shoes on I know he said thank you very much nothing like a drop preacher of new conditions and circumstance what's God doing God is what he's bringing something into being so that he can see it no so that we can see where we come from what we're doing hearing after what property God told us in the seals he said we need to know where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going and man so if we can look back here in Genesis the property God told us this was the seed chapter of the Bible everything began in Genesis that's why I love Genesis and see my book in Genesis my Bible is about tore out because I love the book of Genesis because it brings everything to light prepping God's at all denominations came out of Genesis and then the Word of God was in Genesis in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in Word was God and then the Word was made flesh but that word create don't let it stumble you where there was nothing know what God's doing is God is showing himself in a form that he and like I said before in the book of Genesis 130 times the word God has used God God God God said God said God said God said right here he also said God said and God said let us make man a man thirty times now listen let's read the next one which is lightness we know what lightness is if you look in the mirror that's you a man when God looked at him he said that's my boy he looks just like me mmm you know what he liked that so lightness is what of resemblance an image there was something that came off of God not a second person my third person not a first person but the person of God just steps over in a form so that you and I can understand who he is and man that all right so that you and I can understand listen God is all-knowing he never what he is not one second older than when he said this in the beginning but he had a plan and he had a purpose he had a way of getting himself in spreche in an eternal way but he's doing it through you and I in time that's what I told him this morning in a Sunday School class what a paradox something comes from eternity comes down into time walks for 30-something years in time in a flesh body a man steps over in another dimension and then comes back into this dimension in another form not another person in another form called the Holy Ghost and that same guy's here now that same person is here now and now a many membered body not just one person you said that's simple it's profound and you know what there's one person who can't understand that that's the devil you know why cuz he can't get that God that created him inside of me but you and I can God just took them turn the table it's an all right Satan you do what you want to do here I'm gonna have the last laugh I'm gonna have the last laugh cuz I got something I'm saving for you and it's called my bride hey ma'am because that's what he was doing for Adam because remember when he formed this Genesis 1:26 man like we're talking about last Sunday and let's look at the first quote he formed something out of himself but not another person not another not another entity no what an adoption 1960 let us before we go into further go by Genesis 1:26 so now what's he talkin about Genesis 1:26 I'll pick it up when see when God made man before he made man he called himself el al la lah Elohim the word means in Hebrew the self-existent that's why that God 30 times in the first chapter of Genesis it says God God created God did this God did that God form that alright then when you get to Genesis 1:26 he still said and God said let us make man and God blessed them now if he would have changed his form at that time it would have been something else that he made hear what I'm saying this Genesis 1:26 man when it was formed or created God was still set existing not all right you know why because it was God in another form a man but now watch what he does though the self-existent all by himself nothing existed before him he was all the existence there ever was self existent one now let's going down further roll it up but in Genesis 2 now what do you do in Genesis 2 he put that Genesis 1:26 man into a flesh body is that Alright a man while read between a minute but in Genesis 2 when he made man it's an iamb Yahoo jvu H Yahweh or anyway Jehovah what it mean I am the always distant one who has created something off of myself to be a son of mine are temporary are an amateur little one of mine now you go to Genesis 2 if you want to look in your Bible I'm not going to pull it up here but in Genesis 2 that God has changed now to Lord God Jehovah now has got something that's going to be expressed so that the eye can see see look I'm telling you this Genesis 1:26 man is so hidden it has to be known by revelation right you can't literally see this Genesis 1:26 man in that form you got to see it by revelation because remember if it's all the bride of Jesus Christ if it's the whole book of redemption you can't see that except by the I'm revelation but now when you go to the 2:7 man you're going to literally see Adam standing on the earth not all right you're going to see a form come over and then you're going to be able to see the animals were able to see Adam that all right amen so 30 times the word God was used now in Genesis 2 when God puts in 2:7 he says and the Lord God formed man the Lord God he picks up another even Scofield tells you right here in Scofield the primary meaning of the name Lord is the self-existent one then he comes over to be known as the self-existent one who reveals himself then you come on down further and he says Lord God which is Jehovah Elohim which is a father with his family somebody grab one of these and start spinning it okay there you go I'm going to put names on these and start throwing them at you pay attention let's go to number two these are from last week but I want to I want to kind of go over them again just to show where we're coming from now this is in questions and answers on Genesis 1953 now God created man in his own image and on his own likeness what kind of man that he created a spirit man that's why this Genesis 1:26 man has to be seen by the eye of faith by the eye of faith because it's all the believers and then a spirit man now if you'll notice but now remember when we say spirit man like I said last Sunday when we say spirit man we automatically come on people we automatically go to cash for the friendly go or some spook that's floating around you know or some sheet that don't we darling tell me what is that right when we say ghost we are my Holy Ghost doesn't look like Casper the Friendly Ghost my Holy Ghost is a man and then that's what this was a spirit man not a man that you couldn't see now this man had substance now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find that God give dominion of the cattle and the fish and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to Lisa kind of lead the beasts of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads to believer today before God put Adam in human flesh Adam was all over he could go anywhere remember he wasn't just the God of Eden world North Pole South Pole Africa India of course we know at that time all the land mass was together but that's okay but anyway he had a lot of it was busy but you know what it didn't matter cause you wasn't tired didn't have a human body to deal with but he had a body and man that's the Alpha knee we're going to talk about that maybe a little bit later on down the road because remember when I told him it's morning sunny scoop when God in his theophany when God went into the Garden of Eden and when they fell there must have been so much substance to that man till he could kill a lamb rip the skins off of the lamb throw the skins in Adam and Eve and say here put these on right now that's not a that's not a cache for the friendly ghost poop that can you know know that man listen God always had substance he always has because what we are okay that all right we're man like you let the Holy Spirit leads a believer today because remember that Genesis 1:26 man is the whole experience if you don't know that yes that's where we're heading to that's the Holy Ghost that comes back in the believer a man at Genesis 1:26 men never fail right that Genesis 1:26 men never had a bad thought that Genesis 1:26 man never preached terror never had a headache never had a heart rate because you know what when people in that six dimension which has that are going to walk back into this Dominion into this dimension and pick up that body they're not going to be arms missing there's not going to be and listen I've always told you you talk about the OP Anish we ought listen we are human we always think about the oppening as really is like a sheet in the wind but I'll promise you one thing that's the offering of Paul was so much alive till when they laid him on that chopping block and they cut his human head off when he stepped into that six dimension he did not have to pick his head up off of the ground and put it back on his body no no he just shed this one and walking stepped right over and he was just a solid as he was when he was in other of them in this dimension that's our problem we think of a theophany or something as a lesser or something no no no it's the greater part of us if we're born again that's what's going to carry us into a body change our human spirit will never carry us into a body change I said spirit I didn't say so that all right so this substance of this Genesis 1:26 man to me is is this solid is any of this all right hey my knees not hurt how are you thank God he was in other words Adam the first man in lower creation of God the first creation was God himself boy the theologians they went through their Bibles they're looking for this I guess then out of God comes the logos which was the son of God what the creator what the one that could speak now remember the Bible says that Jesus Christ was the creator and man is that right John 1 Colossians 1 I think somebody read it on the day brother Dell somebody read it the other day but that was the son that was a crappy knew he was a creator then out of the logos which was the word because remember everything was created by what the Word of God in the beginning was the word and word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh oh that's talking about Jesus I thought we were errors and joint-heirs Romans 8 said what he gets we get and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the low God came forth the man now you got Adam now standing on the earth let's go to number three not in flesh body yet hang on we're not flesh body we're still in the Genesis 1:26 man all right go down guys come to man and then God took that and put that into flesh cold out look at that all right all right hey I tell you what take your fingers and do like this and just play like you got one now Isaiah 9:6 we just won't read it but he was to be the everlasting father the mighty God this is the Messiah 1961 when God made man in Genesis 1:26 now remember he did not make all mankind that Genesis 1:26 man is not all mankind that is not Adolf Hitler that is not your neighbor unless he's born again that is not anyone except the children of Almighty God because these people sure man general man was made in the image of God we all got hands feet legs arms intelligence and all that but remember it's a fall Satan twisted it right Satan didn't twist to Genesis 1:26 man listen to Genesis 1:26 man never was fooled the day in his life remember Adam was not fooled Adam knew what he was doing why cuz Gaddy intelligent some God right and it's not written in black and white but I believe he knew the plan of God why would he hold something if he could control all of this world he knew what was going on I don't believe he was book he was blinded remember brother Brown says both eyes open when he walked into the fall he had both eyes open he knew he was selling the whole human race out why he knew the plan I believe he did but we'll get to that in a minute it shows that God made man to be a god to begin with man was made to be a God a lesser God he was made in the image and likeness of God now what he had hands like God yet feet like God eyes ears and intelligence like God now I'm talking like this Genesis 1.6 man because Paul tells us if we are born again we have the mind of Christ we're supposed to and the intelligence like God his whole fiber because he was a son of God cuz remember Adam didn't have a mom and daddy just nature to fall back to then alright he didn't have a mom and daddy nature to fall back to he comes straight from God and then he comes straight from the Almighty when he looks at God he said you're my daddy in good old southern English you're my dad you're my daddy he knew who his daddy was hey man because he was the son of God and then Jesus referred to him as God that's what he's talking about he's talking about when they told Jesus said you'd be a man making yourself God he said you're your Bible the Old Testament the Scrolls you're supposed to know he referred by said you say your gods who the word comes to what was he telling them I'm God because I am the word amen same way with you and I all we throw all this back to this great one called Jesus and that's what he's the greatest man ever walked on the face of the earth but he has given us part of himself for us to manifest what on earth God for us to manifest God on the face of the earth but remember you've got to come from God right like God if you come from the devil you act like the devil that's just plain as it can be I don't look like brother Luis because brother Lu is mom and daddy was not my mom and dad right brother we stole all I mean why because I have the DNA of who brought me here he has the DNA of who brought him here amen all right let's go to the next one let's go to Genesis 2:7 let's get this man in human flesh the Lord God formed man formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul so he takes that one 26 men and he puts him and I'll read it here in a minute he puts him into a flesh body okay all right now let's go to the next quote because it was one from last time and then I think this is where we'll start a new afresh this is a continuation of the questions and answers in 1953 on Genesis now if a man was made something like that little sacred light yonder or something like that it could not be seen no watch because you'll see brother branham he'll say that here's this sacred light talks about God here's this sacred light will now remember if he was just a light then you and I when we were created in His image we would just be like a man he was hidden inside that light I thought the property God told us that that halo in the picture with Jesus Christ Himself the problem with us is we don't have enough revelation to be able to see this actually that was a man if the children of Israel had a had a personal revelation of God they would have looked in that cloud by day in a pillar of fire by night and they would have seen a man God never was anything but a man he's the only man that's why we can stand and say I am made in the image of that man a man so brother branham's explaining here see now if a man was something like that little sacred lot younger or something like that it could not be seen which is the spiritual being he manufactured her unfolding himself a little more to make a trinity old brother Brandon bless your heart now you know he didn't mean that he means trying and he you know that brother I'm never need believes in the Trinity of himself by Father Son and Holy Spirit and here was God unfolded himself now down in to let us make man Genesis 1:26 which was his son and offspring from him man in our own image he was a supernatural being a man because remember love what is that saying natural we're all natural you got God in you your supernatural your feeling natural being but when you put a little God in there a little bit of light of that light he's talking about you become a supernatural being and then and let him have dominion over the cattle of the field so forth and I've scrolled all the way up now the man led the man led the cattle and everything just like the Holy Spirit leads a real true believer today now watch this we register Sunday but did you get this the voice of God out there he stops something tells him he's not saying it right the voice of man rather right what'd he do he brings it to where we know God's a creator we know God can speak but he's bringing it now and letting the man do the speaking you know what he's doing now he's letting the man do the speaking watch the voice of man rather would speak and say call the cattle this way call the sheep over to this pasture garrison Zak would like that if that would happen all the time call the cattle over here and you wouldn't have to go rustle them up wouldn't have to go find them same way with my bees I wouldn't have to crawl 15 foot up in a tree to get a beehive out if they do what they're supposed to do but this was before the fall and then but we're heading back to that condition because when we go back to an eating condition we're still going to we're going to be over nature come on people we're going to be over nature just like Adam was listen Redemption is not replacement if this is before the fall that's what we're going back to why is the lion going to lay down with the lamb all just because no it's because you're there right because you're there in what a pre fallen condition you had went back over and above the fall and you're back into the condition where they're being led by you because the problem with us is remember when Adam fell kita was a pet but after the fall Adam became food for cheetah a man why because you know what the animal did now the animal doesn't talk the Ottoman doesn't have a soul but the animal looked back and said you did this to us we're mad at you you say put in the scripture Roman they said the whole creation is what groaning and travailing growling growling at me and you to get mad because if we ever get back to the rifle condition everything behind us is going to be right hey man everything behind us go listen we're at the highest chain we're right there with God and we fell from that and the whole world groaning and travailing what please do something to get us back to this rifle condition we I want to eat each other anymore the lion will lay down with the lamb they'll eat grass we'll have to eat meat I don't know what then big things where they're going to go but I don't matter call the fish to the water he had Dominion everything obeyed him now but then there was no man to till the soil Genesis to no man to till the soil and then God formed man Genesis 2:7 out of the dust of the earth now we follow it he formed man out of the dust of the earth and put their supernatural spirit everybody got that they got one of these everybody and start spending it hey go red layer start spending that saying judge the spin-spin-spin same thing I'll promise you because you know what if you fall asleep we need to make them where they go but if you'll hold on to that thing man I mean you keep you wait he says that or take your knife and put it right here and just hold it we pray for the sick we do stick in mind and sick and body yeah Thank You Louise we'll let you use okay what a figure brother Padgett we're just human people we're just human and man but we're heading back to something though because he put a former solid dusty earth he put that supernatural spirit now he was laying there I couldn't have many pictures of it I can see Adam standing what a prophet of God go right back in the Garden of Eden hey if Moses can go back there so clear brother Adam how do you know that Eve was the most beautiful woman in the world blunt headed but alive Adams hair was shoulder length listen when he was explaining these things it's just like that he was there and he was because remember when the Prophet goes up he can see as far this way as he came this way amen he said no profit in seeing in the future Moses was a prophet he saw in the past and wrote five books of the Bible and then all right so I can see Adam standing there listen let's take this way and see him standing like a tree god it made him he was dead as he could be his toes like the roots sticking in the ground and God said let there be and breathed the breath of life into him and he jumped came to himself see he was breathed the breath of life into him he became a living soul now and he began to move on move on what he put man in humans what amen he went from he didn't take a supernatural big being and make him lower he just took that supernatural being and put it in something called flesh and then we see it as a lower form because we're on this side fall because remember Genesis 2:7 even when he put man into human flesh it was before the fall and then that's what so that's what's so wonderfully Adam and Eve walked around and we'll read it in a minute they walked around naked for probably hundreds of thousands of years in human flashes and didn't bother why they had a Holy Ghost veil cuz remember let me tell you something we God told those animals to multiply in the earth what is that procreation they were watching the animals all the time procreating you understand what I mean without being graphic they knew listen all they had to do is look at their self and look at the animal let's just be that way okay they knew they were made the same way they were just in the highest form and they had a soul to be able to control that is that Alright she'll be able to control that they had a Holy Ghost veil over their eyes property God tells us then after that the Holy Ghost well was lifted remember hey man what's the truth in him he breathed the breath of life into him and he became a lesser man no I didn't become lesser man he was still God he was still God the earth amen reading the breath of life and he began to leave himself now all right now let's go to Genesis to verse 16 now here on mother's day we're going to we're going to bring whatever this Genesis 1:26 man now we read it last Sunday we read it again but I want you to see something about this and the Lord God Lord God the Lord God Jehovah with a family he he was beginning to be where you could see something and then there's a good book to read called oneness with God I've told you many times before read that book brother Brownwood oneness with God I believe it's 1962 or 63 he said true 1 this was Adam and even and Adam and even God in the garden was true 1 this one hour now we're looking at at the scene we would see God standing here and Adam and Eve would say there's three and that kind of what man season now but when God sees it it's one when he saw brother Brown said true one this was Adam and Eve and God in the Garden of Eden that's true oneness why because that was an extension of God and what was what was Eve he was a firmament or an extension of item we'll read it right here but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now every tree you can eat up and we're not going to get into Whiteman's the garden the lord of mercy else you know what happened in the garden but at the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat for in the day though neither stare of del dot and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will milk make him and help me not a helpmate to help me is this right ok a help meet for him see that doesn't say mate man like brother Dale said you can be a - men can be a mate but to be a helpmeet it was Adam and Eve a man male and female and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field missus beast and mr. beef mr. horse and mrs. horse mr. chicken and mrs. chicken hey man welcome first the chicken of the egg to check head ok afterward came the eggs crazy people and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field every follow the air and brought them under Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called never live whatsoever he would call them called every living creature that was the name like I said last Sunday I had him is sitting there and here comes by this thing that's grey and got a big trunk it looked like a air hose on the front of his face and he's huge and Adam says that is an elephant and God didn't go Adam that does not look like an elephant no God was standing there right beside Adam and he said that's exactly what I was thinking to me that's a revelation so that's the way we're supposed to be led now right a man goes listen God never questioned Adam before the fall he couldn't question Adam before the fall he couldn't he'd be questioning himself right God has never questioned himself why did you do that never we do it all the time but we're on this side of all remember we got to get back on that side of the ball that was a real fall with it it was when it's called the fall a minute it was a fall and Adam gave names to all the cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam that was not found and help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam he slept he took one of his ribs close up the flesh instead thereof now like what Jewell Forney said he said you know he said you come to Adam he took Eve out of Adam and closed the side back up she couldn't get back in but when the second Adam went to Calvary and man speared his side and he said Thomas stick your hand he left the gap open so that we could get back in Christ a man does that God knew the first Adam was going to fall the second item will not fall that's why we can get back into him that all right and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man now like what Lewis said broader and said here this is me made manifest in another form Adam said you are me made manifest in another form God said yep that's you in another form because listen folks and I've told I told miss Martin I'm gonna tell you again those in sun-tzu class going laugh as much as you can try to be this part right here in this human flesh you can't be left doesn't matter like I was telling them before I was delivering mail the other day and I was put a mail in the box and I turned to look and it was some good-looking woman pulled up right beside of me blocking the lane she rolled down a window she looked at me she said what are you doing after work and I about lost my cookies I told them I about strip my gears and ruined an engine it was my wife y'all was thinking Jeannie Jeannie was about to go wise in the world it was June she had pulled up right beside min left what you know what that just thrilled my heart but you know what I was thinking when I left I thought God if that can be so close how about me and you can see that's figlio love the love we're talking about if God is so far above that you think you love your wife or your husband sees me but see Jun and I could never be as much it and we have ups and downs just like everybody we sure enjoy each other we really did this is not bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh now I can't literally say that about her she was formed from Gina and Jackie Thomas and I was formed from Samuel and Peggy Dale our DNA will never match flesh to bone right but now Adam Adam and Eve were literally he could take a DNA sample anywhere on Eve and it would match exactly to that man standing right there hey man so he said yes well this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man now remember but remember we'll read it in a minute her name was Adam Adam gave her the name Eve after the fall that all right but her name was Adam like I said when God when Adam and Eve walked up the garden that was one person and he thought you know God is so patient God is so patient because he's waiting on that to happen again he's waiting on that to happen again to where that he can walk up in front of his bride and say that is me in another form they are literally when we get a change of the body folks we will be literally bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh a man sold us all we are gone waiting the change of the body what I was saying the other day if we can get death destroyed here that will bring that sixth dimension here the reason they can't come here why would they want to come back into death brother Branham standing on the curtain of time he looks back he says I have to go back there right why because that was death on that side and it was life on this side they're going to stay over here until we destroy death on this side realize that we are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and we have a name I call you breath and then we all are different names but one name brought therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave not leave they read it leave now cleave and I didn't I said just that's it is look it didn't say man shall leave his wife and cleave to his mother and father we got only so many going back home now but it says leave your father mother and cleave unto your wife and they shall be one flesh a man and they were both naked and the man and wife and we're not ashamed why there was the Holy Ghost fell there there was no lust involved it was all controlled by God a man that all right without being so so graphic but literally Adam and Eve was one person when we get when we get back above that fallen condition we're going to be one person a man one person but the reason that we're doing in the shape we're in now we know that is because I told them in the same school class you'll not if you see this you're going to see Redemption to its highest form brother Brown said what hold that word redemption Redeemer he can be all these different things but if he doesn't redeem me I'm in trouble and then he's my Redeemer he one that came down here through all this mess went through all this mess took on my sin just like Adam took on Eve sin done alright but Adam could not return into the believer because Adam was a mortal man sure he had the Spirit of God sure he was the son of God the Bible called him a son of God and man he's a son of God he wasn't he didn't fall in his soul hello somebody never he wouldn't be a son of God and if I'm not mistaken if you'll go over and look at Luke I believe that's a capital S for those of you that come to church here you know what that means alright because look the Bible the Bible has capital letters sometimes like when it shouldn't be like that but that means something that gives it a meaning when it's when it's a different when it's a lowercase or an uppercase Y then we're not gonna get into that or we'll never be finished all right so let's go to number five let's read this now look then god taken from his side a piece of him a rib and made a woman now where did he get the spirit woman the spirit come a woman see when he Genesis 1:26 he is a let us make man in our own image and after our own likeness created he them man male and female and he made the burly spirit for the man he made the tender little delicate feminine spirit for the woman now remember let's go back to something that I didn't that I didn't cover last Sunday the Bible tells us in Genesis 1 before they were put into human flesh see this is when go back to our carnal mind that we have to be in flesh bodies to procreate Genesis 1:26 man was told to multiply and replenish the earth before they were put in a flesh body why that's a supernatural spoken seed not a literal man seed it is one man seed the seed Word of God that says let there be let there be he didn't have to go to a manufacturing plant and get his chemicals he just said let there be and then same way with you and I if you're born again so he knew he was going to have some women so we just made your spirit right there how simpler laughs he just made their spirit the Bible said he would in 1 Genesis 1:26 he created him man in a pre figure male and female amen now see we get a pervert in mind like male and female and get all this feelings and and no remember that Genesis 1:26 man has all the characteristics of God not of human mortal man right remember it has to stay supernatural okay that's why that we're going to read in just a minute when brother Brown said the man fell when he was put into the flesh because what in listed the Genesis 1:26 man he can make a billion men and a billion women and not have one problem no divorce no I'm jealous of this one no no sexual relation no clear mind clear body clear spirit Eve let there be even let there be because we're going to read in just a minute how Adam we may not get to it how Adam lost the ability to bring us the way we should have come the spoken word is original seed and that the spoken word is the original seed not man seed man seed will kill you always that's why God created his own seed and his own egg and put it in an incubator hey man so he knew he was going to have some women the Bible said he would Genesis 1.6 he created him man in a pre figure male and female in a pre figure he knew he was going to separate them he's God like I tell in Louise I'm gonna preach a sermon not too long from now maybe called remember they'll phrase there's where there's a will there's a way or there's a will there's a way you're now you are now recipients of the will that God wrote before the foundation of the world and the family is here today all gathered because daddy died come on so my daddy died the testator had to die I've never heard any by reading the will unless you get all kooky about it you never read a will until what somebody did somebody had to die and then look on Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon and Wednesday you have the well written in the book and it's being given to you and he sat there before the foundation of the world and he wrote the will 66 chapters of a will he wrote maybe you'll stay awake for that one if I fall oh sorry mom get me sister that's perfectly fine perfectly fine I don't bother me a bit that's good good to see soon as mom buddy yes you look just like your mama doesn't she that Susan's mom with y'all didn't know that in a prefiguring he made the woman in the man before they was ever formed I was a dust of the earth like Rosa was talking about for knowledge you know you the for knowledge and you look at predestination that's why we hammered so much predestination has to look at foreknowledge first the foreknowledge of God knew what the predestinate that's why he could write this before the foundation of the world he knew what you would choose he knew what Abraham would choose he knew that would be an Isaac a Joseph a Jacob a William Branham a Martin Luther and he what he put them everyone in a will how can we lose we can't lose we just can't we're already in the will and we get it read to us every Sunday and every Wednesday and every time we might play and then cool that and then God made the man look now what you got to really read this and God made the man not in his own image brother Adam the Bible said God was created us in His image what's he talking about this bodies this body is not remember there's a perfect wheel and then there was a wheel that was written after the fall permissive will a man that was a sub will that's written but the sub wheel is not greater than the wheel the sub wheel was written as as what permissive will then we're going to go back to the will will look talked about later and when God made the man not in his own image this body is not in the image of God this body is in the image of beasts somebody asks question one times you why are we now formed the way we are with our body parts the way we are creative evolution folks but you look at a rabbit or a horse or in and you see them doing the procreation thing and that's everything is fine right right see it all the time but now you take somebody with a soul that's got a conscience that's got a self will that's my brother and will not get to it today for them will trying to stay at the hour here but woman remember was different from animal she had a soul she could choose she could do it anytime she wanted to hey man I'm going to read that and then we're going to have to stop again cuz I want to get into to the I'm gonna get Cain and Abel born in here in a month or so get them here on it get them here on the earth okay Callay with something happen between them that's really interesting that you should know and it actually matches with the seals you see the spit Nixon remember every spirit come out of Genesis right amen every spirit all those wild wild horse red horse black horse all the riders came out of Genesis a man they weren't just where John saw him what John was the Prophet John was what taken up so he could see prophetic this way this way this way in this way so he saw those seals they didn't just all of a sudden the horse rider jump up in the end time and start riding now that spirit was here because the devil was here before you were here in this part not the Genesis 1:26 man but in this part you got it cuz remember the Genesis 1:26 men never had a beginning or never had an end ok Staton had a beginning and he's gonna have an end this body is in the image of beasts alright hold on let's see right here we're gonna okay go to the number 6 and then we'll stop right here and then I'm gonna read something on marriage and divorce and then oh don't run out the door don't run out the door I'm going to read something the Prophet said about marriage and divorce we're not gonna get into marriage and divorce okay so don't go out the door alright this part you can sleep maybe but don't go out the door with you alright Joseph father 1963 now when man was made in the image of God he did not fall and let me tell you he could not fall Jessen go back people that one is inside of you never fell never what's our problem it's the flu where's the problem on this side the man when man was made in the image of God he did not fall when he was made in the image of man he fell man is this man what the higher form of creation just like I said why do we have the body parts we have well look look at creative evolution you come up even to the monkeys which we know is close to us but remember the missing link kids in school we always wondered about that man always wondered about that missing link if they'd read Genesis they'd have found a missing because that beach could fall back into the animal race and he could fall up into the human right that all right and he was probably not as hairy and he probably was not as stooped over as a chimpanzee listen Darwin wasn't far off but he was so far off he was he was you know he didn't believe that you know that God didn't in this that we just you know evolved from this but brother Bram said I don't believe in that kind of evolution he said I believe in creative evolution well that's why the beast had to be put there then me and you were put here or Adam and Eve were put here right there's a link missing link why is the link the link links us back to the animal but God did away with that whole length he did away with measured beasts mittens beats and all children beasts oh you don't believe that well if he created a dog and a female dog of the male dog he had to create a female beast in the male beef okay so that was a lot of little beasty people running around but they look kind of like humans because they weren't in harry maybe remember brother i'm city was a little bit bigger but it's just something that we we get in our mind and we get stuck on something and we can't get off of it but look when he was made in the image of beast that's why we look like we do cuz remember brother brown said when we go back to the when we go back past the following other side of the fall there's nothing to be in babies born that's not going to be any any desire any lust and all that goes away why because this is where that comes that this is a manifestation this manifest everything right hey I hope you don't know that tell me how old enough to understand this when he was my sister when is somebody going he slept through sex education class just like he's left through this one when he was made in the image of Beast daddy got on this subject one time and we went outside and everybody's like man we got a sex education course today but listen it's but remember you've got to remember though on this side of the fall it's not the Bible says the beds undefiled and this is way we're supposed to do it so let's don't get so much on this side to where we know we're here this is what we were put here to do on this side of the fall but you know what we're going to do we're going to prove through this that God is going to take us back up to where Adam and Eve was before the ball hey man the very thing that Satan said I'm gonna get you when you know what he was going when he puts them in human flesh that's when I mos def in he said because I can see that beast he can't be controlled on one side of the other he said I can control and then mr. beef just walks over and he goes if he ain't got no kids not kids you don't have no kids God told you to multiply and replenish the earth would you have no children where's your kids he sold her brother Ram city's shoulder sold of his program she didn't keep God's program to where they were going to be spoken word children she said well you're right I made just like you are coming it's real simple if you really look at this whole thing's everything the whole plan is so simple the plan of redemption what happened in the garden and what we're going back to above like I said filial love it went from agape level all the way down brother Brown said it goes down to lush we'll see that's got to go back it's got to go back to filial to agape love which is the headstone that we got to go back to that a man we think we really love our spouse or we really love our children that's just one grain pebble of sand on the beach in the whole world compared to what God's love is a man all right let's read this right here number seven goes before the fall here's brother Branham no marriage in divorce so that still be careful I'm just going to read this all right and he made her for him and not man for her did you know that woman was made for man and not man for woman how many know that congregation says I'm in the Bible teaches that all right she was given a place in man before the fall equal over all creation that's why with Christ the bride is going to be heirs in joint a we're coming back to that Christ came listen and I think we read it last Sunday the property guard said whatever Adam lost in the fall Christ came and restored us back to that level and then we just got our flu stopped up and not enough word to bring us to that okay you preaching to me she was given a place in man before the fall equal over all creation but after the fall now here we bring the subject up because remember he's in marriage the divorce but after the fall he was her ruler listen before the fall the Covenant was as long as you don't eat of that tree you're fine all of your fine everybody's fine your equal whatever Adam and Eve indeed they were listen they were literally each other she just had a spirit that leaned toward what emotion and he had a spirit toward look at Lowndes you know you like sister Gail she would be just a perfect homemaker making everything putting everything together and dicks going to work it comes home knows that sister girls don't have everything ready well see that was the same thing with Adam and Eve and what they did it complemented each other they complemented each other amen that's why before the fall you don't see any squabbling between Adam and Eve but after the fall what's the first thing she does he goes it was that woman you gave me then that woman said it was that beast person right over here and then the beast was over I going the devil made me do it you have a bad thought the devil made me do it but after the fall now here's where we bring the subject up but after the fall he was her ruler she must keep silent in all matters now after the original beginning is over all right Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning that's when time began when God made it first in his original creation all that understands say amen what's he talking about before and the Genesis 1:26 man was made in eternity not time when God listened to me when God put that 1:26 into that 2:7 man was still in eternity hello time didn't begin I read it time began when the fall again all right in the beginning God created just one male and one female but then the woman was made different from the animals all other animals for deception she wasn't made by God for deception remember that she was made , not like the other man animal she could be deceived and she could deceive because you got a soul because I'm like I'm like mostly brother branham was not a woman-hater but he knew one thing for sure that a that a vile woman could hurt you worse than a Bioman - right y'all won't know that we've been in the world we know that a one woman can tear a man apart many men apart all right all on animals for now watch now it wasn't so from the guiness she was made if she had stayed in the original condition with Adam co-equal with Adam stayed right here but but she wouldn't have never been no fault but she caused the fall and the interruption that broke the whole continuity of God now it didn't surprise him he knew that was going to happen and throw death sorrow and everything else on the earth she was made to us now notice now after at the beginning after the beginning after time began all right because remember back in eternity she looked back in that was eternity is over what are we going back to eternity we've slipped down in time and now we're going right back to eternity because remember everything that was lost has to be redeemed back to its original place blood brother I'm say take her back to watch the Garden of Eden take her back to the Garden of Eden which is herb's a bride amen notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there would need to be another covenant made now this is going to stumble you but I'm going to give you the scripture to prove that this is the truth now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was cold equal but now after the fall there's another covenant made she was no longer ruler with him each must have a separate covenant all right let's go to Genesis 3:14 and we're going to read that covenant and then we'll stop right there in about hour and ten minutes I won't try to try to keep like I said will I appreciate brother Delphi let me do this because remember you know you have to try to pack it all in now I can kind of you know be like a baton racer I can just stop for a minute and then take off again so brother Ernie you'll be here next weekend so we can kind of a time to just relax and hope you don't sleep on him like you do me you won't because if somebody knew we do the same thing and the Lord God said under the surface now this is after the fall because down has done this I'm going to skip that part we all know what happened because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle but remember even had to accept seed here first you got to accept seed here first she accepted Satan's lie first and then what this Bonni only maxed what she was thinking and it produced what it produced that all right it wasn't just the sake we always say it wasn't just the sex side right it was her accepting Satan's lie first then what her body had to follow amen because she had failed from that condition thou art cursed alright look he curse the Satan above every beast of the field what he cursed them the missing link or the Beast the serpent cursed above all cattle ever be fulfilled upon thy belly shalt thou go we know what he was turned into a snake and dust shalt thou eat all the days your life and he has not finished eatin dust yet every time you die he's eating your dust that's why we're going to the grave because Satan is eating our dust we go we're going we're going to reverse that folks because that wasn't true before the fall and I will put enmity now that word enmity means division remember when Lazarus was in the bosom of Abraham and he looks over and sees a rich young ruler and rich young ruler said can I come over to you he said no there's a great gulf fixed there's enmity the carnal mind the Bible says is what enmity God knew this that Satan got to her brain first the man got to her brain first so he takes him put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel I just a woman now here's the separate covenant until the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow we know what that is and thy conception in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children and thy desire to be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee all right and into Adam here's his covenant and into Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife he couldn't help it that was him that was him Jesus Christ couldn't help coming to the earth to save us why because we were are a part of him not were but we are and has to eat another tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground now you didn't curse Adam he cursed the ground he didn't curse at him he cursed the ground that's why when Cain brought his fruit of the ground it was already cursed before it got there because he brought the fruit that come up out of the ground and God had already cursed the ground what did Abel do he took a lamb flesh killed it and God accepted it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of your life amen so there's the fall of man and we'll stop right there because the next I wanted to go into and we'll do it next next time is the book of redemption the book of life Adam didn't lose eternal life in his soul he lost a position that he would be able to bring all of his children that God had in his mind brother Branham said God what Adam had to give the book to the original owner again Satan doesn't own this book Satan doesn't own this earth he's a squatter he's just put here because you know why because God can't stand sin Satan you just take over what you need to take over but I'm going to come down into your Eden and I'm gonna bring my children whether you like it or not you're not going to stop it I'm going to come down here and I'm going to hide myself in a group of people that you're not even going to believe can do it but it's in the will already but Adam had to hand the book back to God because this is the book of names that you and I are in this book this is our will you know what if you have a will your names got to be in that wheel somewhere it doesn't just say well whoever wants us whoever wants this car you can have the car no it says to Susan for Bush I give to don't accomplish I give the way now I give to mark action rod I give you just read
