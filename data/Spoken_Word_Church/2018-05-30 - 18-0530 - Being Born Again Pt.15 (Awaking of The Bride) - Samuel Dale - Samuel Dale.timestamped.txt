[2:44] family there and all in the burial and
[2:47] then coming back home and read the Lord
[2:50] we give them a safe journey
[2:51] all right before you see it I want to
[2:53] ask you a question this is just come on
[2:57] not part of the message but it is in the
[2:59] truth of the end of it but do you
[3:03] believe the promises of God are yin amen
[3:07] now that's according to second
[3:09] Corinthians one in 20 and his promises
[3:13] are yay and amen all right now the
[3:15] brother Branham said if you can find in
[3:19] the Bible a promise of God you can call
[3:24] him on the scene and said he has to
[3:28] fulfill it now listen this is what he
[3:30] said now what was the rest of that he
[3:33] said if he don't fulfill it
[3:34] you can call him a liar now that's
[3:38] strong in it well now that's what your
[3:40] prophet said he didn't seem to be upset
[3:43] well maybe I'll get in trouble saying is
[3:46] he he just said it he believed it you
[3:49] know what God come on the scene and
[3:51] honored a lot of things didn't so then
[3:53] we're not concerned about that but all
[3:55] right just remember that now as we get
[3:57] back to it in the message all right
[3:59] father we thank you for your grace and
[4:01] your loving to us thank you for the day
[4:03] in the time that we have thank you for
[4:05] you we ask you to come on the scene now
[4:07] and each and every one of us and open
[4:10] thy word unto us that we may see the day
[4:13] in the time that we're living right
[4:14] where we are in the Word of God thank
[4:17] you for your grace and your promises and
[4:20] just bless each one breast brother
[4:22] Louisa Newman our and family and burial
[4:25] and in the coming back home the Lord to
[4:27] be a hard journey so bless them and take
[4:29] care of them have your way we love you
[4:32] we thank you in Jesus name we've been
[4:38] reading this from first Peter for quite
[4:43] a while so we've shortened it up kind of
[4:45] safe too because we reading from the
[4:48] 23rd verse mainly but we read the 22nd
[4:51] verse the first Peter seeing you out
[4:53] purified your souls in obeying the truth
[4:56] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[4:57] of the Brethren see that you love one
[5:00] another with a pure heart fervently
[5:02] being born again not of corruptible seed
[5:05] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[5:08] which liveth and abideth
[5:11] for ever all right now let's go over to
[5:16] Ephesians 4 and start with the seventh
[5:21] verse yea but unto every one of us is
[5:28] given grace according to the measure of
[5:31] the gift of Christ wherefore he saith
[5:35] when he ascended up high up on high he
[5:40] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[5:42] unto men now that he ascended what is it
[5:45] but that he also descended first into
[5:48] the lower parts of the earth he that
[5:51] descended is the same one also that
[5:53] ascended up far above all heavens that
[5:56] he might fill all things and he gave
[5:59] some apostles and some prophets and some
[6:02] evangelists and some pastors and
[6:04] teachers for the perfecting of the
[6:06] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[6:09] the edifying of the body of Christ do we
[6:12] all come in the unity of the faith and
[6:15] of the knowledge
[6:16] now that's till we come till means in
[6:19] other words that a specific stated point
[6:22] about the word till like we you say
[6:24] we'll do this until or something like
[6:27] that so you're setting us a space
[6:30] talking of the word till we all come of
[6:34] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[6:36] Son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[6:38] measure of the stature of the fullness
[6:40] of Christ that we henceforth be no more
[6:43] children tossed to and fro and carried
[6:45] about with ever win why do you need
[6:48] these this measure of Christ why do you
[6:50] need this stature of a perfect man that
[6:53] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[6:57] to and fro and carried about with every
[6:59] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[7:01] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[7:04] in wait to deceive but speaking the
[7:08] truth in love may grow up into him in
[7:11] all things which is the head even Christ
[7:14] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[7:18] together and compacted by that which
[7:22] ever joint supplies
[7:24] according to the affection other words
[7:25] got to be all together as one right
[7:30] according to the effectual working in
[7:33] the measure of every part maketh
[7:35] intercession of the body unto the
[7:39] edifying of itself in love now we pick
[7:41] up the verse 14 of the fifth chapter
[7:46] more for he saith awake thou that
[7:50] sleepest and arise from the dead in
[7:54] Christ shall give thee lot you may be
[7:58] seated to the Lord at his blessing to
[8:00] the reading of the word what about
[8:02] coming to a time in the Bible to work
[8:07] that you can say we see this being
[8:10] fulfilled we see that being fulfilled we
[8:14] talked a lot about the worldly things
[8:16] you know and seeing Russia doing this
[8:19] China doing that and all of the things
[8:22] thinking there the other day as Wade was
[8:25] ministering see the seals reveal some
[8:28] natural things yeah but then they reveal
[8:32] spiritual things so we can stay on the
[8:35] natural that's all we'll get we would
[8:37] you see Russia doing this China doing
[8:39] that this happening there that happening
[8:42] there we don't want to stay with that we
[8:45] want to get into the spiritual side to
[8:47] see what that has to do with us now all
[8:51] right recognizing your day and its
[8:53] message our time that we are to be upon
[8:56] the earth all right now to give thoughts
[9:01] to that then think about the hour that
[9:05] we're living and to be able to read
[9:08] yourself right into that no all right no
[9:13] I mean you say well we believe the tower
[9:16] fell that was in the Bible okay it is
[9:22] it's there in the scriptures that when
[9:24] the towers fall then the light of the
[9:26] bride would be there the light of the
[9:28] Sun and the light of the Sun will be
[9:30] seven times that we believe that well
[9:33] you know what you could point to it and
[9:35] say that happened
[9:37] in my day you know you'd say well you
[9:44] know cuz somebody could stand and look
[9:46] and they say you know I was here when
[9:48] they created or put together the first
[9:50] automobile you know well you know that's
[9:55] a great you say well that's right there
[9:57] that's the very our well when are we
[9:59] going to recognize the very day and our
[10:02] that we're living we're walking one day
[10:05] at a time that's what I've been thinking
[10:06] sorry about that I hadn't priest in
[10:08] about I've been over three weeks I guess
[10:11] and so I'm feeling pretty good about it
[10:13] you know just keep praying for this
[10:15] little throat Satan keeps bothering me
[10:17] about it but it'll be all right all
[10:20] right
[10:20] but you know I've if somebody said said
[10:23] you you're through with your vacation I
[10:25] said yeah gotta preach Wednesday you
[10:28] know so that's good all right but think
[10:31] about it now think about the day and the
[10:35] hour that you're living because in the
[10:41] Bible now according to my understanding
[10:42] of reading the Word of God it of you
[10:45] know for all these years of studying it
[10:47] that the only person in the Bible that
[10:52] would ever amount to anything was
[10:54] someone who recognized recognized
[10:59] themselves as being in the word of that
[11:04] hour and time and is speaking of them
[11:10] right if speaking of them well when are
[11:13] we going to start doing that because
[11:16] until we it comes personal to us until
[11:20] it becomes a reality to us of what's
[11:22] happening in this day we are not going
[11:27] to be encouraged oh we can talk about it
[11:33] yeah we can say yeah one look at this
[11:35] enough but we already got that down or
[11:37] not thing about it you know instead of
[11:40] saying praise God we're here mean I mean
[11:46] you know you don't want to go and do
[11:48] things in the wrong form
[11:50] in mind but you know the Bible spoke of
[11:54] the tower falling which meant there were
[11:58] thousands of people going to die right
[12:03] well you say well we didn't want that no
[12:05] no no we didn't want that to happen but
[12:08] the Bible said that would happen and
[12:11] then we see it happen right I'm trying
[12:18] to get us to follow the seriousness of
[12:21] recognizing who we are and what's taking
[12:23] place all right
[12:25] because that'll bring us to a position
[12:27] then to follow in the day and to know
[12:31] where we're standing
[12:33] all right they knowing that it's
[12:36] speaking about us all right you know the
[12:39] old saying was they the the guy was
[12:42] getting a newspaper a day ahead of time
[12:44] you know and he he could just bet on
[12:47] anything or he knowed everything for
[12:49] whatever took place and all kind of
[12:51] things and boy he was doing really great
[12:53] until he read in the newspaper that he
[12:55] died that day before so that would do
[12:58] that well we don't want that see we
[13:02] don't want none of that part of it we
[13:03] want it but it just gets the story point
[13:06] to us all right now I'm gonna watch when
[13:10] we get if we get to the end if we don't
[13:11] we'll take up Sunday there in Ephesians
[13:14] it says a white thou that sleepest you
[13:26] know brother Roman said that was the
[13:27] bride you want it in there you want me
[13:31] to wait the later to quote it or bring
[13:32] it
[13:34] that's the bride asleep he said of being
[13:40] asleep it's not dead he said it's been
[13:43] asleep he said out there among that
[13:46] system even supplying our monitor 'yes
[13:52] except for whatever to that system and
[13:56] it says for us to awake
[13:59] no we'll get to that in a minute and
[14:01] then we'll get our our thought you'll
[14:03] see it Todd
[14:04] okay now what have we been doing we have
[14:09] reached a position in bringing the new
[14:12] birth I hope you followed that and to
[14:17] knowing for assurity to understand what
[14:19] the new birth is that it's the birth of
[14:22] the word the word that's been made alive
[14:26] to you what that God was going to send a
[14:30] prophet that was his new birth right
[14:41] when who was it which one was it system
[14:43] ET that was questioning God about what
[14:47] are the Mary brother branham or not and
[14:49] what was what happened behold i send you
[14:54] elijah the prophet well you know what
[14:59] she just went married him well you know
[15:03] she she believed God and God spoke
[15:07] personally to her and seemed I had the
[15:10] Prophet alright now why does he went
[15:14] over and said bill something spoke to me
[15:17] and told me that I'm supposed to marry
[15:21] Elisha the prophet where can I find him
[15:23] do you know anything about where he's at
[15:27] you know your spiritual man and in a
[15:30] great man of honor and now could you
[15:32] help me find Elijah no not quite alright
[15:42] yeah so follow the talk now we've talked
[15:47] about the new birth as being the birth
[15:49] of the word the word that you've took
[15:52] and and the born-again experience and
[15:54] how did each age had that new birth
[15:57] every age down through their head to new
[16:00] birth each one of them had to birth
[16:03] through the word and their experience
[16:06] fit the same as to all ages because it
[16:11] was the opening of God's Word to them
[16:14] and their their evidence was the same of
[16:17] the Holy Ghost
[16:18] for every age because it was what now
[16:22] what is the evidence whether or not the
[16:25] spirit in you can agree with a word so
[16:29] that would be forever church age forever
[16:33] individual all right now see that way we
[16:38] can find ourselves in the Word of God in
[16:41] the hour all right to know now listen
[16:45] this is going to be a surprise after a
[16:48] while when we follow something I thought
[16:50] into the message if we have time because
[16:54] see that birth brought you into the body
[17:00] of Christ
[17:02] alright that fulfilled Jesus in tech and
[17:07] talking to Nicodemus and telling him you
[17:09] must be born again he couldn't
[17:11] understand that but they did understand
[17:14] it when the Holy Ghost fell under their
[17:16] penticoff and it brought them to a
[17:19] position that they themselves saw
[17:22] something personal now what if you were
[17:25] standing there are sitting in the upper
[17:28] room and the Holy Ghost was falling and
[17:30] you you you said well it's not only so I
[17:35] guess it's not happening well I don't
[17:38] think that would have stopped God from
[17:40] fulfilling his word to you I think he
[17:44] would went right ahead and fulfilled it
[17:45] with all of our unbelief and things
[17:48] course we know we wouldn't have been in
[17:49] the room but still the point all right
[17:53] now so we come to that part of talking
[17:57] about the born-again experience the
[18:01] Prophet would say statue a perfect man
[18:03] how faith and be born again all right
[18:08] how faith and be born again he said
[18:12] cause the faith is the foundation and he
[18:16] said the foundation of all Christianity
[18:18] is based up on faith and what is faith
[18:21] faith is the substance of things hoped
[18:24] for the evidence of things not seen
[18:26] faith is a revelation from God to
[18:29] personally to you that's why you new
[18:31] birth
[18:32] his revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[18:34] personally that he's speaking to you all
[18:38] right now we should recognize that and
[18:41] say thank you Lord for seeing what the
[18:44] new birth is we may have been thinking
[18:47] maybe some thinking of well I thought
[18:50] the new birth was this I thought the new
[18:51] birth was that I thought it was crying I
[18:53] thought it was shouting I thought that's
[18:55] the after-effects that's not the birth
[18:58] all right so maybe that's out of the way
[19:02] now that we can follow that line and
[19:04] that thought and what not that's not D
[19:08] Christianizing are doing away with
[19:09] anything we believe that a still birth
[19:14] is a dead baby all right so we know that
[19:18] there was no new birth in Christ that
[19:21] was a dead baby it's all alive in its
[19:25] depart for the day in the hour that
[19:27] we're living all right now maybe it
[19:30] meant nothing to you I'm not saying that
[19:34] wrongly I'm saying that you're putting
[19:36] it back into your lap as to think about
[19:38] it see you'd say well what do we need to
[19:40] know about the new birth you know well I
[19:44] remember the Prophet said there in one
[19:47] of the statements we were given he said
[19:50] another word talking about the Holy
[19:52] Ghost he said it's been so missed out
[19:55] you know or incorrectly taught and he
[19:58] said how can you if you don't know what
[20:01] the Holy Ghost is something to that
[20:02] degree he said how can you know you got
[20:04] it welcome it is it's a very vital thing
[20:08] to know what the new birth is and see
[20:12] then anybody that ask you you can give
[20:14] Alma a statement my new birth is the
[20:19] birth of the word that God has revealed
[20:22] to me and that is my eternal life well
[20:28] and then the rest of my life our birth
[20:31] is being born again and climbing up the
[20:35] pyramid coming out to the place that
[20:43] God can live in my heart as he wants to
[20:48] and the day that we're living all right
[20:50] now white kind of you know brother
[20:59] Nathaniel is they didn't know too much
[21:01] about what was going on the other day
[21:02] but I'm glad Nathaniel was here one
[21:07] thing I enjoyed what he had to say
[21:09] you know enjoyed the message - it took a
[21:13] part off of me of having to preach as
[21:16] far as the coffin and the things and
[21:18] that helper so that was a part and you
[21:22] know but see I I didn't need to preach
[21:28] the message that it was going to preach
[21:33] see I needed to wait till tonight all
[21:37] right now I'm gonna read and you can
[21:40] believe what you want to or think well
[21:42] you did hear I didn't add any more I
[21:45] added one quote into these notes from
[21:50] almost two weeks so when I get to
[21:54] reading these notes in a minute and some
[21:57] of you've got them and you already seen
[21:59] that Wade gave these quotes Sunday so
[22:03] you're gonna catch on to what's taking
[22:06] place all right now then that'll that'll
[22:09] bring it to a point that we could
[22:11] understand all right
[22:13] but now my approach is to try to get you
[22:17] to see one thing that the new birth is
[22:21] the birth of that word that you heard
[22:25] making you alive in Christ giving you
[22:28] eternal life all right
[22:30] and it comes out to be that it's word
[22:34] added to word as a growth development in
[22:38] Christ all right now we lost down
[22:43] through time the ability to achieve unto
[22:48] the part that Peter was speaking off of
[22:51] the statue of a perfect man now you
[22:54] probably won't agree with
[22:55] but I thought you had listened we lost
[22:58] that part of understanding what it would
[23:03] be to be the stature of a perfect man
[23:06] alright that's been my whole point to
[23:09] try to get us to see alright we that was
[23:12] lost through the ages but to be restored
[23:15] by the last day messenger to bring it to
[23:20] that place that somebody could attain
[23:23] unto that position
[23:25] alright then in doing that then we
[23:28] follow the simplicity of the Prophet and
[23:31] as I said a moment ago then we come up
[23:33] to the point we should have reached it
[23:35] by now that we can look at all of the
[23:37] things of life and time and usually
[23:39] everything aside and simply think about
[23:42] that that new birth being the birth of
[23:45] the word that you have faith and be born
[23:47] again alright now we read in 2nd Peter
[23:51] or then it says what you've escaped the
[23:56] corruption that is in the world and the
[23:57] time and who is that written to those
[24:00] that are in Christ Jesus
[24:01] all right it is not written to the world
[24:04] to try to give a growth development you
[24:06] got to get the person born again first
[24:09] all right see the person has to be born
[24:12] again before they can start any kind of
[24:14] a growth development in Christ
[24:16] alright so it's required that we receive
[24:18] that new birth all right in that new
[24:20] birth is what gives us eternal life all
[24:24] right
[24:25] then the Prophet come to bring us the
[24:27] message how to attain unto the stature
[24:32] of a perfect man how that it would be
[24:34] word upon word line upon line here a
[24:37] little darling fulfilling all of the
[24:40] Scriptures to point down to her that we
[24:43] would be in the restoration in our day
[24:47] all right now as I tried to bring out
[24:51] some things from it what I see most
[24:54] people have today in the message that
[24:57] I've listened to the people and you say
[25:01] well who are you well that's okay who
[25:03] are you so we just solve that problem
[25:04] and we know it's worth nothing I'm just
[25:07] talking trying to get you to see
[25:08] something
[25:09] go see what what you hear among most of
[25:13] the ministers of this message is a
[25:16] message of reformation is to stopping
[25:21] this and stopping that and don't do this
[25:23] and don't do that and in trying to get
[25:25] people to work in that room of getting
[25:29] saved and all I can't and that's well
[25:30] and wonderful it's got to be done but if
[25:34] you bring a band through Reformation
[25:36] you're not going to bring him to a new
[25:38] birth you're gonna bring him only to his
[25:41] thoughts and ideas of how that he is a
[25:45] Christian all right and I'm talking
[25:47] about all over looking at the rims of
[25:51] mankind in this message outside the
[25:53] message everything that mankind has come
[25:56] to a point looking at it it's the most
[25:58] religious day that has ever been right I
[26:02] mean you got more billions of dollars
[26:06] being spent around the world in
[26:09] Christian hospitals and schools and etc
[26:12] right and you said what brother Dale
[26:16] that's a wonderful thing I'm not against
[26:19] that I thank God for that all right but
[26:23] is that the Christianity you know I mean
[26:29] is that too Christianity that we are to
[26:32] bring to the people or it is is it the
[26:36] birth of the word that God has given
[26:40] unto us for us to walk into that word
[26:43] and say thank you Lord we come to
[26:47] Reformation but to most people's I think
[26:52] Reformation is restoration it is not
[26:56] reform is to just change you from this
[27:00] to that stopped you from being an
[27:04] alcoholic but leave your tobacco holic
[27:08] you know what I mean is that right now
[27:12] that we come through those days and
[27:13] churches that we seen preachers preach
[27:16] against drinking we get the old one
[27:19] outside and smoke the well you know what
[27:22] that is that's rough
[27:23] Meishan it's trying to get you to change
[27:25] from one thing to another it's not a new
[27:28] birth experience to take care of the
[27:30] desires of all the things of that you
[27:33] know to word that like brother Tom fob
[27:36] which I remember he prayed a prayer to
[27:39] God about the smoking and just a lot of
[27:43] you know for certain smoking is a hard
[27:46] demon to to get away from all right and
[27:49] he said he prayed and said Lord take
[27:53] away the need and the desire well he
[28:01] said I never desired another cigarette
[28:04] he said it never did desirable but you
[28:08] know yourself you've been through it a
[28:09] lot of youhow did you throw them away
[28:11] pick them back up throw them away
[28:13] pick them up you you you fault that
[28:15] demon over and over because you didn't
[28:18] know maybe the route of room to fight
[28:21] with but yet you you've done that see a
[28:24] lot of that is carnal reform Reformation
[28:29] just changing you from one meeting house
[28:32] to another take your hat and coat as
[28:34] brother Mark said moving him this
[28:35] building to that building and say I'm a
[28:38] Christian
[28:39] alright we'll see we're supposed to be
[28:43] trying to get to restoration alright
[28:47] restoration means to restore back to
[28:50] something that was previously there
[28:52] alright the disciples had you read the
[28:58] statute perfect man so you know the
[28:59] probably said he said the disciples had
[29:01] these virtues all right see then Peter
[29:05] was trying to tell the people how to
[29:07] come to the place of those virtues okay
[29:11] and when it did see then we're gonna get
[29:15] to like knowledge in a minute I mean uh
[29:17] not today but we're gonna get to
[29:20] knowledge and to think about how could
[29:23] you come up with all these doctrines
[29:24] that's in the message if you got Holy
[29:26] Ghost knowledge
[29:31] now that can't be holy ghost knowledge
[29:34] that brings you to any other thing like
[29:36] my wife and I were talking today about
[29:38] things and see you would you would say
[29:40] what so-and-so this or that you know
[29:42] would happen well what if you had a
[29:44] dream and laid it out and you had this
[29:46] dream and in this dream you wish to get
[29:50] this and you was to get that and and you
[29:51] was to inherit millions of dollars and
[29:54] and you as to to really come forth you
[29:57] know as a great person and on all the
[30:00] world etc and I like that right and then
[30:05] in that dream after the dream was had I
[30:10] was trying to explain something to her
[30:12] about this like who was it Joseph Smith
[30:15] but rested I don't daddy had a dream but
[30:20] he said what he said it wasn't of God
[30:23] well how was he to know how was he to
[30:31] know he didn't have no profit to go to
[30:35] with it to straighten it out what was
[30:39] getting at brother Branham had to dream
[30:41] you remember when he was at
[30:43] Jeffersonville in his home and
[30:44] everything now in the dream we remember
[30:48] when they plowed up the trees and the
[30:50] rocks and things in front of his house
[30:53] and he come back in his dream well he
[30:56] grabbed that guy he hit him and knocked
[30:58] him down well the guy kind of moved on
[31:01] from said something he grabbed him up
[31:03] hit him again
[31:05] now that was the dream right but God
[31:14] spoke to the Prophet he says now when
[31:17] this comes to Pais by Pais this what was
[31:22] he to bypass hitting the guy right
[31:27] come on be sensible he was divided by
[31:31] hitting the guy because he wasn't
[31:33] supposed to hit the guy but in the dream
[31:35] he was shown that he'd hit the guy twice
[31:38] well yet see he was a prophet that could
[31:40] come forth all right
[31:42] see like I've seen about you you could
[31:44] have a dream
[31:45] you could have this for a vision and see
[31:47] all these great things what if at the
[31:49] end of your vision and you saw it come
[31:51] to Pais you remember in the Bible if a
[31:55] prophet give you a sign and there come
[31:57] to Pais and he take you to another God
[32:03] now what are you gonna do get up and
[32:07] tell the dream I told you all I was
[32:09] gonna get this I told you all I was
[32:11] gonna get that I told you this was gonna
[32:12] happen
[32:13] I told you that was gonna happen all of
[32:15] that happened to the tee all of you
[32:16] agree then it happened exactly the way I
[32:19] told you it says now we need to believe
[32:22] in a Trinity what are you gonna fight
[32:27] with give me your dream see it's very
[32:34] vital to know what the birth of the word
[32:37] is it's the birth of that word that will
[32:41] keep you from following after wrong
[32:45] doctrines and ideas all right it had to
[32:48] be restored because in time it was eaten
[32:52] away of the perb I mean the part of the
[32:55] statue of a perfect man to be able to
[32:58] achieve unto that position and it would
[33:00] come forth as a babe in Christ and have
[33:03] to grow into those things but we should
[33:06] be to the basis that it should be in our
[33:08] day that we're through with that baby
[33:10] stuff we should be able to check
[33:13] everything by the word you say well
[33:19] brother day elders and mean times if you
[33:21] told us this and will we tell it to you
[33:23] one more time brother how do you check
[33:26] anybody's word that they bring or a
[33:29] message I check it by my own experience
[33:35] who are you
[33:37] maybe we're yeah come on I'll check it
[33:40] by my own experience well because if my
[33:43] experience is according to the world if
[33:46] this has brought me to one God and the
[33:49] truth of understanding of God in his
[33:52] ways and then you come up and give me
[33:54] all of these other visions and dreams
[33:55] and life but that takes me to another
[33:58] guy
[33:59] what am I supposed to do I know what the
[34:02] Bible says I'm posted but heaven help us
[34:05] we need to bypass it you know what the
[34:08] Bible says to do your son if he
[34:11] prophesize a lie
[34:14] kill him is that Bible since the kill
[34:22] him
[34:24] now let's bypass that okay you see what
[34:30] I'm getting at you can say I've got all
[34:33] of this with all of that but there's
[34:35] some of it don't fit in there exactly
[34:36] right but we've got to have a prophet so
[34:40] the Prophet gave us the message what was
[34:44] his message it will read and we've read
[34:46] over and over and over what was his
[34:48] message Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the
[34:57] endtime
[34:57] fathers to the message of the hour of
[35:03] what we thought see is the double part
[35:05] back there and come on over here okay
[35:07] what is it to do what was this message
[35:11] to do turn our hearts back to the faith
[35:14] of the Father what is the faith of the
[35:17] father
[35:19] it's the revelation of God's Word what's
[35:22] that in a minute now
[35:23] what is the faith of the father's it's
[35:26] not just to say well he's supposed to
[35:29] turn back to the statute of perfect man
[35:32] now he's to bring the entire Bible right
[35:36] the faith of the fathers is to bring the
[35:39] entire Bible because they were the
[35:40] writers of the Bible agree and as they
[35:46] were the writers of the Bible then we
[35:47] would turn back to the entire Bible not
[35:49] to just the statue of a perfect man now
[35:52] when we read in a minute the Prophet
[35:53] said that he's revealed he turned her
[35:56] hearts back you need to reveal the
[35:57] thunders which is revelation 16 and to
[36:00] be these divinely revealed mystery truth
[36:02] that literally do that all right now
[36:04] that is the only way I want to Scripture
[36:09] I want the Prophet
[36:13] you see that's why people don't like me
[36:16] better way but heaven help us when are
[36:20] we going to stand for what we believe
[36:26] show me any other thing that can bring
[36:29] the faith of the Father than what the
[36:32] Prophet said it well when we can do this
[36:38] we can do you know better than that you
[36:42] can't do it you got to come the way he
[36:46] said it right all right so then what
[36:51] does he start off by doing now to try to
[36:52] shorten I the end ago he says add to
[36:57] your faith he doesn't say Peter never
[36:59] says add faith
[37:03] show me the scripture you don't say add
[37:05] faith faith is the birth you don't add
[37:11] to birth faith is the birth faith is the
[37:15] baby here right and the baby has all the
[37:21] parts that it has need of so you don't
[37:24] add any parts to complete the child you
[37:29] just simply add food for it to grow up
[37:32] as we read in Peter there to grow up in
[37:36] him all right so there's no such thing
[37:40] as add faith faith is the birth faith is
[37:46] your experience in God to give you the
[37:48] new birth which is the birth of the word
[37:49] aren't then he said then add to your
[37:52] faith remember it's your faith what did
[38:02] brethren say about that this is my God
[38:06] gave it to me
[38:09] it's my the new birth is my new birth
[38:14] God gave it to me there was no way I
[38:18] could get that without God so your faith
[38:24] according to Black's famous names what
[38:26] now your mental faith becomes a
[38:28] spiritual revelation now you've got to
[38:32] Bertha mental faith is not the birth a
[38:36] mental knowledge of the word is not the
[38:38] birth of the word the birth of the word
[38:41] is when the word is quickened in your
[38:43] heart is made alive what is the
[38:45] difference between the Bible you read
[38:47] today and the Bible you read in the
[38:49] Baptist Methodist Presbyterian etc I've
[38:52] never seen any word that the words
[38:54] changed right now you can change by
[39:00] picking up all these good news isn't
[39:01] modern man and everything but you know
[39:03] what I'm talking about we don't go with
[39:05] stuff like that we just going with the
[39:07] truth all right
[39:09] but see it says add to your faith add
[39:13] virtue
[39:15] well now how are you gonna get virtue
[39:22] that was where we ended up it was where
[39:25] we stopped on our thought how are we to
[39:28] get virtue it okay
[39:36] the simple question I asked 19 and 80
[39:39] I mean 70 running over 71 how do we get
[39:44] these virtues you've read the book what
[39:52] the broad runs say well we folks out
[39:54] verse so we'll just have it now how are
[40:00] you going to get and wildest let's do
[40:04] this let's do it this way you know what
[40:07] brother Brown calls all of those things
[40:10] in the stacks of a perfect man virtues
[40:14] well he said you know knowledge and all
[40:18] like that temporally he says those are
[40:20] virtues now what's he talking about he
[40:23] done told you it's not a virgin life hmm
[40:30] we'll get to that as we go along but
[40:32] have you sleighing that out to you free
[40:33] to think huh see now how are we going to
[40:38] get
[40:38] you how we're going to get knowledge we
[40:40] just read a lot more that would be known
[40:47] as worldly knowledge and you profit said
[40:49] statue a permit this is not worldly
[40:51] knowledge and see I know what your
[40:56] thoughts on a lot of things are and you
[40:58] have some thoughts that are good and I'm
[41:01] not discrediting the thoughts but some
[41:03] of you think well I could have brotherly
[41:05] kindness up here before I get virtue
[41:08] down here hmm all right all I'm asking
[41:15] there simple explanation
[41:17] how'd you get up there he's saying you
[41:21] don't have brotherly kindness I said you
[41:23] don't have knowledge etc what I'm saying
[41:27] it can't be done
[41:30] that's your knowledge that's your
[41:32] virtues that's your thoughts don't go up
[41:36] a ladder and skip a bunch of rungs that
[41:38] don't work now it may with you that you
[41:43] think well I just come up here I just
[41:44] will see that's what people say people
[41:48] of the message say I've got brotherly
[41:51] kindness because I was born in this age
[41:54] of Lady hacia so that means I've got
[41:57] this and I've got love because I was
[42:00] born in this age well so does Adolph
[42:05] Hitler the brother Dale you're
[42:09] disgusting to use things like that I'm
[42:15] trying my best to get you to think we
[42:20] can't climb up a ladder and jump up and
[42:22] then skip a rung get all the knowledge
[42:28] you can read all you can read every day
[42:31] study every day listen to tapes every
[42:34] day get all of that knowledge into you
[42:38] that you can get cause it'll come in
[42:41] handy
[42:43] but it will not bring you virtue and
[42:50] virtue has to come before knowledge can
[42:53] come now are you following me the first
[43:01] thing we need is to talk about virtue
[43:04] well how do we get virtue well I don't
[43:09] let me jump up one let me start on
[43:12] knowledge go ahead but I say to you
[43:19] without any remorse of any thoughts for
[43:21] any point of backing up from it it won't
[43:25] work it'll bring you to head knowledge
[43:27] it'll bring you to wonderful thing
[43:29] praise God for head knowledge that's
[43:33] what people's always been against me on
[43:34] their sake our brother Dale just an
[43:36] intellect well there's one thing about
[43:37] it if I've got the seed in the field God
[43:41] can do something with it
[43:42] what's the matter will you bunch of junk
[43:44] that ain't got the seed in the field you
[43:50] played around while I was studying God's
[43:52] Word at least I've got a foundation for
[43:54] God to quicken what can you quicken on
[43:59] you that's out there here wherever it
[44:04] goes but listen we have to grow into the
[44:11] statue of a perfect man
[44:12] do you realize by saying what I'll do
[44:15] brother Dale out its work on brotherly
[44:16] kindness well that'd be a good thought
[44:21] we need to we're always working
[44:24] presently kinda but you know what I mean
[44:26] now obvious I to get Burt brother
[44:28] kindness first well you know what that
[44:30] would kind of do in in you're thinking
[44:33] of the baby did you understand what did
[44:41] you say it then you'd be whacking the
[44:44] baby and - here standing with the legs
[44:46] and jumping him up to hit hop and
[44:48] nothing in between you following me
[44:54] nothing in between so that won't work
[44:58] let's get that out of the way don't even
[45:02] consider talking to me about well I
[45:04] think I've got this that or the other I
[45:06] told you the only thing God ever spoke
[45:09] to me about the statue of a perfect man
[45:11] he said if you'll have patience with the
[45:12] people that it'll prove you have
[45:14] patience well I'm my patience is pretty
[45:16] thin and has always been pretty thin so
[45:19] I don't worry about telling you about
[45:26] but listen how do we come in to these
[45:32] virtues how do you grow as a natural
[45:36] child you grow by eating the word you
[45:44] grow by eating the Word of God so then
[45:47] it's wonderful to have had knowledge
[45:51] because at least God can quicken it well
[45:56] I'll just sit down here and wait on God
[45:58] I've got it now listen Suzie we use
[46:01] these times we know how to quote brother
[46:03] Branham
[46:04] brother Brown said one day if I have a
[46:06] need garter put somebody on the pulpit
[46:09] the full feeling I agree with that 100%
[46:12] but if that's what you're waiting on
[46:14] I don't agree we if you're waiting on
[46:20] God to put somebody on the pulpit to do
[46:22] it I don't agree we this prophets
[46:24] message has already been brought are you
[46:26] trying to look for something else to
[46:28] happen
[46:30] you're in danger is over the getting
[46:33] caught in the trials because he'll put
[46:36] up these people on the pulpit that'll
[46:38] say things that really sounds good
[46:43] you came all right now as we approach
[46:50] this thought that we've read over and
[46:54] over and over 327 go ahead and pull up
[46:56] number one I want you to think a simple
[47:01] little thought the simplicity of
[47:05] thinking in the human mind
[47:07] it's to think about when a prophet would
[47:10] say and tell you how to attain unto
[47:12] something why would you want to find
[47:15] other ways to attain right what would be
[47:25] the problem what would be the point we
[47:29] asked the Prophet brother Branham what
[47:33] is the new birth crossing mister God
[47:37] revealed he says revelation Jesus Christ
[47:39] personally that's the answer what are we
[47:46] doing with the message I thought the
[47:48] message was the answer to our questions
[47:51] I didn't know it was your ideas and mine
[48:00] and yet you have people you know
[48:04] yourself the Prophet said it blasphemous
[48:06] names and cry and the statue a perfect
[48:08] man that a people have a portion of
[48:09] these virtues and not even born again
[48:13] would you remember what he said that was
[48:15] he said that was like a peacock putting
[48:17] butter and feathers in and hollering I'm
[48:19] a peacock
[48:19] now I didn't say that your prophet saw
[48:23] and said it so read the message huh
[48:28] brother Branham how do we how are we to
[48:33] come to the stature of a perfect man we
[48:41] know we can't depend upon mankind to
[48:44] bring us these things we must depend
[48:47] upon the Prophet to bring the message
[48:52] right we can't depend upon thoughts this
[48:55] is what I think it is I liked that one
[48:59] huh I know I'm hateful and arrogant oh
[49:02] dude you know you talk to people in
[49:04] there say watch your input
[49:11] right what's your input here's what the
[49:20] Prophet said that's my input so you say
[49:26] what's your input meaning what's your
[49:28] thoughts I didn't know that we had any
[49:31] talks I thought we were supposed to cast
[49:34] away our thoughts take what the prophets
[49:41] say it and believe it could you see our
[49:49] life depends upon it
[49:50] oh yeah we like to take marriage and
[49:55] divorce and read it we like to take uh
[49:59] you know different messages and read
[50:01] because of what we won't the Prophet to
[50:06] say but can we take the entire message
[50:11] of what he said well I've always been
[50:15] open to you you think I'm off the
[50:18] message come to me let's talk about it
[50:25] but no you won't do that you'll go to
[50:27] others and talk about well that's
[50:30] according to the Bible a schism in other
[50:33] words you don't realize that's the devil
[50:34] in you doing it because I'm open up
[50:37] enough to let you know I've always been
[50:40] open if I'm off the words come show me
[50:44] but don't come in will it rather there I
[50:47] think it's so entitled bring me what the
[50:54] Prophet said or the Bible says and let's
[50:58] go from the dark is that being sarcastic
[51:09] all right now if we approach this to
[51:12] read about it where the Prophet will say
[51:14] that that will take these divinely
[51:17] revealed mystery truths to literally
[51:20] turn our hearts back I want you to think
[51:24] a little different than what your
[51:26] thoughts is playing in your mind and has
[51:30] been playing for a while
[51:33] well let's understand of elation
[51:35] cleaning for seventh seal that's true
[51:40] that's true now
[51:51] but if the Thunder is the revelation
[51:54] contained in the seven seals and the
[51:57] seven seals is the entire plan of
[52:00] redemption is that true yeah I'm asking
[52:05] you to make your statement the seals is
[52:09] the entire plan of redemption to mankind
[52:13] so the seals is revealing one guard
[52:16] water baptism no eternal hell all of
[52:18] these things that's what wage doing see
[52:20] coming back from the natural to go to
[52:24] the spiritual coming from the white
[52:27] horse rider of the literal part of the
[52:30] seal as be in that system this dark and
[52:34] then bringing it over on to the side
[52:36] where you're at in the white righteous
[52:39] church that is really the righteous
[52:41] church and then bringing it down to
[52:46] simplicity of talking about
[52:47] justification and the blood the blood
[52:55] the in sanctification and see that in
[52:59] that blood of the natural is the killing
[53:01] of the people that's not to seal that's
[53:05] what happens in the natural the seal is
[53:07] the Holy Spirit taking off over here to
[53:10] reveal the blood of Jesus Christ and how
[53:12] wonderful and marvelous it is to
[53:14] sanctify some senators aside for those
[53:16] are you following the message like that
[53:21] well I just don't understand what you
[53:23] why he's going you know you're trying to
[53:25] figure it out just listen
[53:28] Agro asked him a question I mean he's
[53:32] like I am was it they don't bother me so
[53:34] I can't say what in the world are you
[53:36] talking about don't bother me hmm
[53:42] but listen so then what you're talking
[53:46] about how will we come to the statue of
[53:50] a perfect man the faith of the fathers
[53:55] not to just know what the seals are not
[53:59] to just know Daniel seventy weeks not to
[54:02] just know this or that or the other it's
[54:05] no the entire revelation of Jesus Christ
[54:07] from the entire Bible are you listening
[54:13] the entire Bible is the revelation of
[54:16] Jesus Christ is that true artificial
[54:19] revelation of Jesus Christ then he's
[54:21] going to show us how to come into these
[54:23] virtues by being a partaker of himself
[54:28] not to just know the seals or to know
[54:31] this or to know that I've never talked
[54:33] nothing like that your prophet that's
[54:37] what's so amazing in the sealed that's
[54:39] where he loses the people they're
[54:42] wanting to know what the first Celia and
[54:44] then look into something they finally
[54:47] zero it down and they get it on the
[54:49] Antichrist and he goes and he's done
[54:54] gone any ain't talking about Antichrist
[54:57] no more he's talking about Jesus Christ
[55:00] what I'd like to know what that first
[55:04] seal is I don't mind telling you brother
[55:10] Mohit I wanted to get that seal book so
[55:12] bad when I first heard he started
[55:14] introducing the message to me and I
[55:15] heard about them sealed I know old man
[55:17] they say we knew a little bit in the
[55:19] Bible just a tad bit and I wanted to
[55:22] know what no seals were he said you
[55:25] ain't getting the book he said you're
[55:28] gonna read this message this message
[55:30] this message then you'll get your church
[55:31] age book and said when you get to church
[55:34] age book and finish that church age book
[55:36] I mean have you ever read the church
[55:41] needs book maybe two three days pretty
[55:45] good book honey oh it didn't take me no
[55:50] time cuz i standing there with my hand i
[55:52] okay you promise me where's this seal
[55:55] book he said okay here take it and read
[55:58] it I mean if you heard me say this I'm
[56:01] honest to tell you I read to seal book I
[56:04] enjoyed the great things that were
[56:06] brought out and there were things way
[56:07] beyond what we'd ever even considered or
[56:09] anything of what it was but when I
[56:12] finished the seals and reading that seal
[56:14] book I was just as blind and and ever
[56:17] thing is I was when I started other than
[56:19] some wordings and thoughts and ideas you
[56:23] know what I doing I like to see a book
[56:25] down I went back to the church age
[56:30] school and I studied that church age
[56:34] book dissected it over and over and all
[56:37] I could get a hold of and talking to him
[56:38] about the thing you know it was probably
[56:42] six months maybe a year forever picked
[56:45] up silver because the I knew I didn't
[56:50] know what I was talking about I knew I
[56:53] didn't understand what in the world he
[56:55] was saying called one minute he had a
[56:58] seal as being a Antichrist in a
[57:00] situation of this are the second seal
[57:03] that blood and him killing and all I got
[57:04] in it in a minute he was talking about
[57:06] sanctification how did he get from there
[57:11] to here and he's he he spends 10 minutes
[57:20] telling me what the natural seal is and
[57:23] 45 minutes or an hour and a half telling
[57:26] me what the spiritual part is I thought
[57:29] well when we get up to set with I will
[57:31] have a little better understanding boy
[57:33] he blowed me from one end to the other
[57:35] and I had a decent memory and a decent
[57:40] understanding of the Bible yet I was so
[57:45] lost that I didn't know what in the
[57:46] world a man was talking about it's not
[57:48] elated outside and I went back to what I
[57:54] could understand then after a while I
[57:57] seen that what he was doing ten minutes
[58:04] to talk about an antichrist the whole
[58:08] thing was to talk about Jesus Christ and
[58:12] I saw then we were trying to figure out
[58:14] the seals as to what they were naturally
[58:21] you gonna you're gonna get to a good
[58:23] enjoyment pretty quick because see
[58:26] there's only four seals to the early
[58:27] journey of mankind
[58:33] only four seals to the earthly journey
[58:36] of mankind you better better start
[58:43] realizing get on spiritual what are you
[58:45] talking about
[58:46] what are you saying I'm saying this
[58:49] point that the entire Bible is what we
[58:55] have need of not to just know the seals
[58:59] and the layouts and the things or the
[59:02] trumpets and the vials and the plagues
[59:04] oh you go haywire getting into Feast of
[59:08] the trumpets you want to get into Feast
[59:10] of Trumpets for a few minutes and quote
[59:13] brother Branham until a great man in
[59:17] this message he said he made so many
[59:18] slips for the tongues and that he said
[59:20] you can't even follow any McCain
[59:21] understanding and he said in the message
[59:23] it was thus saith the Lord but I heard
[59:27] the man himself he said you can't
[59:28] understand what he's talking about look
[59:31] down I thought what in the world this
[59:33] God hmm but listen jerks
[59:41] I'm talking about the revelation what's
[59:43] going to bring us to the statue of a
[59:46] perfect man
[59:47] well Lula Church knows about the seal so
[59:50] we got that we got that now boy we got
[59:52] the sealed but do we have this message
[1:00:02] do we have the life of the message
[1:00:12] so you understand what I'm getting at I
[1:00:14] know I'm just gonna get this point in
[1:00:15] deny that's okay we've got to understand
[1:00:20] the entire Bible the entire Bible of the
[1:00:24] revelation of Jesus Christ is what's
[1:00:26] going to bring us to the statue of a
[1:00:27] perfect now you go read your ears
[1:00:31] almanacs and the things you know and you
[1:00:33] read all the other things and don't read
[1:00:35] or listen I'm not against that if you
[1:00:40] don't like to read you can listen but
[1:00:43] it's some way get to the message you ask
[1:00:48] me well what message should I listen to
[1:00:51] well listen to this that little all
[1:00:54] right I do the best I can trying to lay
[1:00:58] out ahead of time but you ought to be so
[1:01:01] point to work that you're glad to listen
[1:01:04] to any message don't worry about it your
[1:01:09] prophet is going to bring out things in
[1:01:11] the 50s that are very valuable to
[1:01:16] understand in the 60s and there's not no
[1:01:21] such thing in our thoughts our doctor
[1:01:23] and her idea shouldn't be that brother
[1:01:25] Branham up until 63 couldn't be trusted
[1:01:29] the son of man had to come in
[1:01:31] straightening my arm you had never heard
[1:01:34] that same way you've come from some of
[1:01:37] the places and been around the place is
[1:01:39] your to hurt it sorry it's true listen
[1:01:48] it's the entire Bible that is going to
[1:01:52] bring you an eye to the statue of a
[1:01:55] perfect lamb
[1:01:56] it's not to just say brother Dale should
[1:01:59] we read this seal book should we just
[1:02:02] stay in the seal book and keep reading
[1:02:03] it will you need to write but don't
[1:02:09] forget the rest of the message and after
[1:02:11] all the said and done don't forget the
[1:02:13] Bible you know don't forget the Bible I
[1:02:21] hope
[1:02:22] it gives you a thought where you can
[1:02:24] understand because we read this quote
[1:02:25] many times you know it'll be these
[1:02:27] divinely revealed mystery true
[1:02:28] we'll see you think well I've got the
[1:02:30] seals so I got the seals I've got the
[1:02:32] statue a perfect man mm-hmm yes when God
[1:02:38] adds these things and remember are you
[1:02:46] listening
[1:02:47] remember this statement there is not but
[1:02:52] one new birth right but in the statue of
[1:02:57] a perfect man you've got to be birthed
[1:02:59] into each one of those virtues so that
[1:03:02] gives you seven new births not saying
[1:03:06] seven new births like you got to go to
[1:03:08] the altar and have a new birth again
[1:03:09] it's a seven verse of the word it's the
[1:03:13] word being birthed into you and I
[1:03:16] there's one new birth that brings you
[1:03:20] eternal life though this brings us
[1:03:22] growth development just as it does for
[1:03:24] you to eat a seven-course meal you start
[1:03:27] off with a baby you don't give it a
[1:03:28] seven course meal you don't even give it
[1:03:31] a one course but after a while it does
[1:03:36] get to where you can feed them a little
[1:03:37] bit I think it's time that you and I
[1:03:40] should be able to settle down and eat
[1:03:42] the Word of God it doesn't bother me for
[1:03:46] somebody to come along and preach error
[1:03:52] no because I'm not afraid of the Holy
[1:03:56] Ghost is within me
[1:03:58] the one that has protected me all of
[1:04:01] these years I'm not afraid of him
[1:04:03] letting me get caught but you know what
[1:04:07] he is the only one that can tell me what
[1:04:12] the word says it's exactly right that we
[1:04:15] need no man teachers because the Holy
[1:04:17] Ghost will teach us that's exactly
[1:04:19] scriptural but then we take it we don't
[1:04:23] need teachers we don't need that that
[1:04:25] any what it said he's talking about that
[1:04:29] nobody can teach you it takes the Holy
[1:04:33] Spirit to teach you
[1:04:36] I thought we believed in adoption has to
[1:04:41] be in the tutor that the Holy Spirit was
[1:04:44] our tutor to direct us hmm sees that a
[1:04:52] way if you understand what I'm getting
[1:04:54] at listen it doesn't mean we all have
[1:04:57] the same understanding we're building a
[1:04:59] body of Christ we each one have our
[1:05:03] measure we read in in Peter we each one
[1:05:08] have our measure for the part that we
[1:05:13] are the children have their part are
[1:05:16] measured unto them according to their
[1:05:18] ability and there's people that is we're
[1:05:26] not all on the same level how would you
[1:05:29] have a body if you had everybody on the
[1:05:32] same level but we need to be at least on
[1:05:37] one thing they're all eating the same
[1:05:40] food as we always say yeah I love a good
[1:05:48] steak that's good they had an
[1:05:52] opportunity tonight and brother and
[1:05:55] sister took me and my wife out for her
[1:05:57] birthday
[1:05:57] one said order anything you won't I said
[1:06:00] I won't this page in this page in this
[1:06:01] page he said I'll pay far thank you you
[1:06:08] know what I wound up eating a salad and
[1:06:11] I enjoyed it
[1:06:12] right not got what I wanted hmm you see
[1:06:20] that's the way it is in the Word of God
[1:06:22] that's why the that we don't reject
[1:06:24] something but we don't need to know them
[1:06:27] things that's that's that simple stuff
[1:06:29] back there that simplicity might be
[1:06:34] what's keeping us from coming to the
[1:06:37] virtues where you following me so now
[1:06:44] let's read this statement with a with an
[1:06:46] understanding go ahead and pull number
[1:06:48] one back
[1:06:49] let's read it now remember we're asking
[1:06:53] the Prophet brother Branham how are we
[1:07:00] to attain unto these virtues and what
[1:07:09] were these virtues bring 2pi makes 327
[1:07:20] lady you see in church age church age
[1:07:22] book now this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[1:07:26] Revelation 2:10 7 is going to do two
[1:07:28] things one according to Malachi for he
[1:07:34] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:07:35] the father's icesoft there's what he
[1:07:39] came for
[1:07:41] read the book and see if he didn't say
[1:07:43] Lord fill me up with these things
[1:07:45] that I may teach others to bringing
[1:07:47] these things into the body of Christ he
[1:07:50] knew what he was to bring the faith of
[1:07:55] the father the revelation of the
[1:07:58] father's Laura now you understand why I
[1:08:02] was saying about the Bible you realize
[1:08:04] the Bible was written by those disciples
[1:08:07] you realize that was God speaking
[1:08:10] through mankind to bring to you and I
[1:08:12] his word but it'll take the same God
[1:08:18] revealing that to you to bring you and
[1:08:22] me to a virtue one according to Malachi
[1:08:30] 4 you turn the hearts of the children to
[1:08:32] the Father
[1:08:34] now look at him number 2 he will reveal
[1:08:39] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:08:44] revelations 10 which are the revelations
[1:08:47] contained in the seven seals what are
[1:08:53] the seven seals the entire plan of
[1:08:56] redemption so what did you do he'll
[1:09:02] reveal the mystery
[1:09:04] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:09:08] which are the revelation attained in the
[1:09:10] seven sealed and once it'll be these
[1:09:12] divinely revealed mystery truths the
[1:09:16] seals that literally turned the hearts
[1:09:20] of the children to the Pentecostal
[1:09:23] fathers exactly so so how are we to
[1:09:27] attain unto the stature or a perfect man
[1:09:34] what would these verses so witness how
[1:09:36] virtue will look up what virtue means
[1:09:40] and we'll we'll get over brother
[1:09:42] so-and-so somewhere and we'll find
[1:09:43] something that Charles Larkin or this
[1:09:46] guy or that guy or Billy Graham or
[1:09:48] they're all Roberts or something
[1:09:50] talk about virtue Evan happy
[1:10:02] I thought we believe God sent a prophet
[1:10:06] to us I didn't know that he sent Billy
[1:10:11] Graham or Robertson etc to us to change
[1:10:16] us I thought it was the messenger of
[1:10:21] Malachi 4 I thought he was to bring the
[1:10:26] bride to the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:28] I thought it'd be so much until he would
[1:10:32] be pointing to the skies and to return
[1:10:36] of Christ talking about the bride I
[1:10:41] thought it'd be him that would bring us
[1:10:44] to the revelation of God's Word you see
[1:10:53] that's why I asked questions it's a
[1:11:00] brother Branham what is the new birth
[1:11:04] there's so much confusion about what
[1:11:06] this isn't that it what is the new bar
[1:11:08] it's a revelation in Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] personally do you alright I've got the
[1:11:13] answer the answer is always in the
[1:11:19] message I never will forget we were
[1:11:22] standing in a church one time and we had
[1:11:24] changed the dates of a fellowship
[1:11:27] meeting the only one time we done it
[1:11:29] some we will remember we don't hit one
[1:11:31] time for the people and we don't hit for
[1:11:34] the deer hunters because of the time
[1:11:36] fell on exactly the time of the opening
[1:11:38] of the of the deer season so I got to
[1:11:40] okay to change it and this brother oh he
[1:11:44] was really so nice you know he came up
[1:11:47] he said where was you at last week
[1:11:48] brother day I said I don't know what I
[1:11:53] think what do you mean well you wanted
[1:11:56] to meet and change oh okay I'll tell you
[1:11:59] I didn't go hunting I didn't want it for
[1:12:02] me cuz I wouldn't even go in anyway I
[1:12:06] said I didn't know honey it's a cold I
[1:12:09] didn't care he said well what if the
[1:12:13] Lord had
[1:12:15] come life week rat darn the fellowship
[1:12:21] meeting and took us out of here ice
[1:12:25] ain't got no problem well what would you
[1:12:30] doing I said I got no problem I got the
[1:12:32] profit so what you mean you got the
[1:12:36] profit I said according to what my
[1:12:40] profits saying he said I'll meet you on
[1:12:45] him game trails that's exactly what he
[1:12:51] said now you arguing I'll find you the
[1:12:52] quote he said I'll meet you on him game
[1:12:54] trails I said where would I being I'd
[1:12:57] have been better off than you I'd have
[1:12:58] been on the game trail when brother
[1:13:01] looked at the other said I told you not
[1:13:03] to ask him cause he'd have an answer why
[1:13:07] answer within the message okay but
[1:13:17] listen
[1:13:19] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:13:21] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[1:13:25] the children to the pentecostal fathers
[1:13:27] now this is the only thing I've ever
[1:13:29] said about it why are the people of this
[1:13:32] message so taboo about the seals and
[1:13:36] don't want to know what they are when
[1:13:39] your prophet said that was now you find
[1:13:43] me another one you find me another place
[1:13:45] that he says some other way to get the
[1:13:48] virtues and I'll be glad to come here
[1:13:50] put it on there put it on the internet
[1:13:52] and be glad to tell you who told me that
[1:13:56] I've been around too long you can't find
[1:13:59] it there's your only hope of the virtues
[1:14:07] it can only be done by the opening of
[1:14:10] God's word the virtues can only come
[1:14:15] into being because of the opening of
[1:14:17] God's Word how does the opening of God's
[1:14:21] Word come by way of the profit so we're
[1:14:26] turning down the very thing
[1:14:31] did he say head of course I become your
[1:14:34] enemy because I tell you the truth of
[1:14:36] what he said he says on Daniel seventy
[1:14:40] weeks he said if you don't understand
[1:14:44] Daniel seventy weeks you cannot
[1:14:46] understand the seals of all the plagues
[1:14:49] or trouble that's what he said
[1:14:54] you need that be glad to find it for you
[1:14:58] but if you get you Daniel seventy weeks
[1:15:00] book and over the front page you'll find
[1:15:02] it right there
[1:15:03] it's in the book of course what you're
[1:15:06] saying to a lot of people see like I
[1:15:08] said they don't even have the book you
[1:15:10] can say oferta but I don't have a book
[1:15:13] but you have to know all about the 70
[1:15:16] weeks they know all about the seals and
[1:15:18] never read the book well I just stand
[1:15:29] where I did 40 years ago to say the same
[1:15:32] thing how do we get these virtues it's
[1:15:38] by the opening of the Word of God which
[1:15:41] is the seals that Daniel seventy weeks
[1:15:43] all the things you don't have to
[1:15:45] understand all of the things you don't
[1:15:48] have to understand the Daniel seventy
[1:15:51] weeks as to why this fitstar this but
[1:15:53] you got to understand one time that what
[1:15:56] he was saying is what God gave the
[1:15:59] people now he says on Daniel 70 week
[1:16:05] that God put it on his pen to write it
[1:16:10] and he says six or seven times there's
[1:16:13] one week left after the rapture but yet
[1:16:19] you've never read the book but yet
[1:16:21] you'll go to the other quotes and the
[1:16:23] seals of this or that or the other and
[1:16:25] try to quote something that's what I'm
[1:16:29] driving that church
[1:16:32] yeah but you're making an arrogant to me
[1:16:34] because I'm it was an arrogant
[1:16:41] suppose you would just be coming in to
[1:16:43] mention if you walk in and say brother
[1:16:45] Dale what do I do to get these virtues I
[1:16:47] just heard you preach a message I heard
[1:16:49] the Prophet said we got how these verse
[1:16:51] how do I get them and then I read you a
[1:16:57] quote of how to get him that won't some
[1:17:02] other way like a brother said that time
[1:17:05] to brother mode he said I meant how many
[1:17:09] messages you preached on that statue or
[1:17:11] preventing so about 65 he's ain't got
[1:17:13] time to listen 65 tapes
[1:17:15] my mom said you've been listening all
[1:17:18] these other times and then got nothing
[1:17:19] yet he was a little more blunt than you
[1:17:24] need to hold the truth but you see God
[1:17:30] has given us the understanding how to
[1:17:36] come to the stature of a perfect man
[1:17:44] he's given it to her but why would we
[1:17:48] turn it down
[1:17:54] I mean I'm honest if you told me so will
[1:17:57] brother Dale it's the thunders which is
[1:18:00] revelation contained in the seventh seal
[1:18:01] well there's one thing for sure I'd want
[1:18:03] to read you see look I'd study that seal
[1:18:07] book until I could know every page and
[1:18:09] every paragraph and what was said on
[1:18:11] each one of them because that would be
[1:18:13] the way yeah but nobody knows what this
[1:18:19] is and that is too late for me to cover
[1:18:22] a lot of things now let me preach a
[1:18:26] second but nobody knows who this is or
[1:18:29] the seals are and the thunders and the
[1:18:32] thing well if the prophet told us and I
[1:18:38] preached it with a challenge I'm going
[1:18:41] to read here in a minute where the
[1:18:42] Thunder is the voice of God when the
[1:18:44] seal broke now I want you to show me
[1:18:50] there's something else I'm up for
[1:18:55] correction I want you to show me where
[1:18:59] it says it's something else
[1:19:04] you see Church we tried to block it all
[1:19:07] off and makes other people responsible
[1:19:10] and problems because if we don't
[1:19:12] understand and then we say what I just
[1:19:15] can't understand brother Dale what don't
[1:19:20] you understand I asked a simple question
[1:19:24] how do we get the statue of a perfect
[1:19:26] man you've definitely been through the
[1:19:31] message you're supposed to then of
[1:19:32] listening a reading of the statute a
[1:19:34] perfect plan can you find anywhere in
[1:19:37] there
[1:19:37] a way or a channel or a thought to bring
[1:19:40] those things did brother Branham put it
[1:19:44] down there now to get virtue we need to
[1:19:45] do this to get knowledge we need to do
[1:19:47] there to get the patience we need to do
[1:19:49] that yeah matter of fact he made it look
[1:19:52] worse than what we could ever think
[1:19:55] about
[1:19:59] but for him to make a simple statement
[1:20:05] this profit was to do two things
[1:20:08] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:20:11] the faith of the Father that was what he
[1:20:14] came for right then to reveal the seven
[1:20:20] thunders which in Revelation contains
[1:20:21] and he said it'll be these to finally
[1:20:25] reveal mystery truth these thunders is
[1:20:31] what's going to turn us back what's
[1:20:39] eating brother Dale none of us know what
[1:20:41] the thunders are if the prophet said
[1:20:44] it's the voice of God then what right
[1:20:47] have we got to say anything else right I
[1:20:54] mean give me a reason for saying
[1:20:56] anything out they listen go ahead we'll
[1:21:04] try to do a few anyway go to number two
[1:21:06] you know where he's taken from on the
[1:21:08] first seal and he's taking it from the
[1:21:10] scripture where Jesus was standing there
[1:21:12] with him and he said it he it thundered
[1:21:16] but he knew what it say it right they
[1:21:22] said it thundered but he knew it was the
[1:21:25] voice of God the thunders a voice of God
[1:21:33] you don't know what a thunder is let's
[1:21:35] read it so he's using instead of I heard
[1:21:38] they said it thundered then when the
[1:21:41] lamb took the book and broke that first
[1:21:44] seal God spoke from his eternal throne
[1:21:47] to say what that seal was to be revealed
[1:21:52] God spoke from his eternal zone then
[1:21:59] brother Brennan said Jesus is out
[1:22:01] hearing God speech you want to know what
[1:22:06] it is we read it but when it was placed
[1:22:10] before John it was innocent
[1:22:13] when John saw it was still a mystery why
[1:22:17] he wasn't even reveal right then it
[1:22:20] cannot be revealed until what he said
[1:22:22] here at the end time but it coming our
[1:22:25] symbol you realize that if it had been
[1:22:29] made known back dark you and I wouldn't
[1:22:32] be here oh I never thought of it like to
[1:22:39] have you and I wouldn't be here okay all
[1:22:45] right when the Thunder remember a loud
[1:22:47] clapping noise of a thunder is the force
[1:22:51] of God that's what the Bible said see a
[1:22:54] clap of thunder they thought it was the
[1:22:58] thunder but it was God he understood it
[1:23:02] for it was revealed to him see it was a
[1:23:05] thunder and notice the first he'll open
[1:23:08] the first seal when it opened in the
[1:23:10] symbol form it thundered now what about
[1:23:14] when it's opened in its reality for
[1:23:17] whites just finishing up parts of those
[1:23:19] things you'll listen revelation 6:1
[1:23:25] there's one thunder in seven seals broke
[1:23:33] profit goes to Tucson Arizona it was one
[1:23:36] thunder one black but he never knew what
[1:23:46] the first seal was when he was out there
[1:23:49] now that's his words or else you're
[1:23:52] making him a liar so go ahead because he
[1:23:55] said I don't know what the first seal he
[1:23:57] priest God his simplicity he preached
[1:23:59] the breech and he said I don't know what
[1:24:01] the first seal is well he just done that
[1:24:06] wouldn't you just go ahead and pittypat
[1:24:07] all you want to in your little brain
[1:24:09] because you're not influencing me none
[1:24:11] I'm listening to what he said he said he
[1:24:14] was took over and I'll be glad to show
[1:24:16] you that he was took up out there and
[1:24:17] told to come back to Jeffersonville say
[1:24:20] it'll be totally you want to do that's
[1:24:23] what it was told him out there come back
[1:24:25] to Jeffersonville
[1:24:26] one thunder
[1:24:29] what is it thunder it thundered as soon
[1:24:32] as the lamb struck back to seal and what
[1:24:34] did the veal not all of itself it
[1:24:37] thundered the voice of God he thundered
[1:24:44] on Mount Sinai but the people didn't
[1:24:52] understand the voice of God sounded on
[1:24:58] Mount Sania I'm reading the prophet but
[1:25:01] they didn't understand you see a thunder
[1:25:07] can go off and be the voice of God but
[1:25:09] it takes a prophet to know what the
[1:25:12] thunder is all right brother branham
[1:25:17] what is the thunder
[1:25:22] what is it Thunder brother branham what
[1:25:29] about it go to number three first seal
[1:25:33] all right and a thunder went off John
[1:25:37] knew it was the voice of God and then
[1:25:41] the line like creature says come and see
[1:25:45] what is the voice of God Thunder is the
[1:25:49] voice of God see if we'd have been
[1:25:52] standing there that day we would have
[1:25:53] heard boom bloom bloom bloom bloom but
[1:25:57] he heard God speaking to them he told
[1:26:01] him you know this is mine that's not the
[1:26:04] one over on what he told him who he was
[1:26:07] and what he was doing so now listen go
[1:26:16] ahead the number three or that's one we
[1:26:21] don't going to number four the first
[1:26:23] seal now let us find the symbols we
[1:26:25] found out what the Thunder means that's
[1:26:31] perfectly we know that the thunder was
[1:26:34] the voice of God when the seal opened
[1:26:42] one happen out dirty come back there's
[1:26:44] one sound but there was seven seals to
[1:26:49] be broke now I didn't say it he did he
[1:26:53] said I don't know what the first seal is
[1:26:57] and he said on the first seal I would
[1:27:01] have made a horrible mistake today if
[1:27:05] the Holy Spirit had not come and
[1:27:08] corrected me on something that I was
[1:27:11] going to write or to say but the thunder
[1:27:24] was the horse of God Jehovah thundered
[1:27:31] on Mount Sinai and divorce of God the
[1:27:37] number six voice of the Thunder the
[1:27:41] voice came from war from the throne
[1:27:43] where the lamb had left just left its
[1:27:45] intercessor and he's standing here now
[1:27:47] to take the position and his claims but
[1:27:51] the Thunder came from the inside of the
[1:27:54] throne thundered out and the lamb was
[1:27:59] standing out here well the lamb is God
[1:28:06] that's true but there's a voice a
[1:28:11] prophets got to tell you what that is I
[1:28:16] promised you I wouldn't leave this
[1:28:18] dangling so I'll go go ahead number
[1:28:20] seven
[1:28:31] back up on this in the message Sunday
[1:28:37] and look what he says revivals that were
[1:28:42] supposed to have we have denominational
[1:28:45] revivals we haven't had a real steering
[1:28:48] no no no no no sir don't think we got
[1:28:52] revivals we haven't oh they got millions
[1:28:55] and millions and millions of church
[1:28:57] members but not a revival and over the
[1:29:02] bride hasn't had a revival yet see
[1:29:04] there's been no revival there no
[1:29:08] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:29:10] yet we're looking for it it will take
[1:29:15] those seven unknown thunders back dark
[1:29:17] to wake her up again he will send it he
[1:29:22] promised it was he was dead I think the
[1:29:32] next quote would it wait doll that
[1:29:33] sleepeth next quote number eight I don't
[1:29:39] believe that God is calling owner to the
[1:29:41] fall time to repent in this verse he's
[1:29:43] talking to the his elect they have some
[1:29:45] repenting to do many of his children are
[1:29:48] still in those false churches there are
[1:29:51] those of whom it speaks in Ephesians
[1:29:54] 5:14 awake thou that sleepest and arise
[1:29:57] from the dead in Christ shall give thee
[1:30:00] light to be asleep is not to be dead
[1:30:02] these are sleeping amongst the dead they
[1:30:05] are not there they are out there in the
[1:30:08] dead denominations they're floating
[1:30:10] along with them God cries out wake up
[1:30:13] repent of your folly here they are
[1:30:15] lending their influence giving their
[1:30:18] time and their money actually their
[1:30:20] lives to these Antichrist organizations
[1:30:23] and all the while thinking it is alright
[1:30:26] they need to repent they must repent
[1:30:29] they need to have a change of mind and
[1:30:32] turn back toward the truth I'll recap
[1:30:37] that and review it awake thou that
[1:30:42] sleepest
[1:30:49] according what he said in the sale book
[1:30:55] and take the thunders to wake up the
[1:30:57] bride no now we're standing on the verge
[1:31:05] of one thing as the thunders sounded if
[1:31:14] they have we have a capability of coming
[1:31:18] to the Statue of a perfect man
[1:31:20] if the thunders had not sounded we do
[1:31:24] not have an ability to fulfill those
[1:31:29] scriptures so it's up to us to find out
[1:31:33] where we stand it the thunders the force
[1:31:38] of God from the seal breaks oh yeah but
[1:31:48] that's different from this one is it the
[1:31:54] Thunder is the voice of God
[1:31:55] so wait thou that sleepest the President
[1:31:59] on asleep and awake um I mean the
[1:32:01] message we're sleeping in slumber and if
[1:32:09] we don't know where we're at and until
[1:32:12] we know where we're at
[1:32:13] come on musician until we know where
[1:32:16] we're at and what's taking place and
[1:32:20] begin to realize the day in the hour
[1:32:22] that we're living we are still asleep
[1:32:26] we have not been woke up by the seven
[1:32:29] unknown thunders I'll review these
[1:32:36] Sundays so don't worry about it
[1:32:37] the prophets said the bride hadn't had a
[1:32:39] revival yet he said he'd take those
[1:32:45] seven unknown thunders to wake her up
[1:32:48] but brother Dale ain't gonna be no more
[1:32:50] world wide sweeping revivals nobody said
[1:32:52] anything about it he's talking about a
[1:32:55] revival for the bride he said the bride
[1:32:57] he is
[1:32:57] the world the next world wide sweeping
[1:33:01] revival is the two witnesses to Israel
[1:33:03] right am i right but you know we're
[1:33:08] supposed to be in a revival of the word
[1:33:17] that's why I've always told you I don't
[1:33:20] back up don't steps from the day I
[1:33:23] entered this message and begin to see it
[1:33:25] I've been in the greatest revival that
[1:33:28] has ever been in the world because I've
[1:33:31] been in the basis of the opening of the
[1:33:34] word because I refuse to just follow
[1:33:37] abandon their ideas first message I
[1:33:41] preached here July the 4th 1971 was
[1:33:44] going beyond man's camp and I said this
[1:33:48] then and meaning it still today I said
[1:33:50] you cabbage down and sat down on the
[1:33:52] message and claiming that this is this
[1:33:55] and this is that but I said get out of
[1:33:59] the way because we're going on
[1:34:03] going beyond man's camp nearly 50 years
[1:34:09] or still standing and saying the same
[1:34:10] thing you see I have a revival when God
[1:34:14] speaks to me when he tells me something
[1:34:22] I'm revived you don't think of it like
[1:34:28] that
[1:34:29] we're not supposed to have a worldwide
[1:34:31] sleeping revival right but whoever done
[1:34:35] away with a revival to the bride now
[1:34:37] let's see because you ministers and once
[1:34:39] done it you makes it revival to the
[1:34:42] ministers of this message didn't listen
[1:34:44] to him revivals over brother Branham
[1:34:47] said they hadn't had it yet he said
[1:34:52] it'll take him seven unknowns understood
[1:34:53] wake her up for a revival he said she
[1:34:56] was dead out in sleeping in in
[1:34:58] denominations and needs to be woke up a
[1:35:05] revival is promised to the bride
[1:35:08] a revealing of God's Word don't worry
[1:35:16] about it the Prophet said it'll come
[1:35:19] because it's promised after the door the
[1:35:22] Gentile churches closed God willing on
[1:35:24] the church then and he'll do in one year
[1:35:25] or what theologist tried to do in 2000
[1:35:27] he said but he's doing it now are you
[1:35:32] not happy in your soul for the word that
[1:35:34] you heard are you not happy for the
[1:35:39] things that God has spoken to you about
[1:35:42] or are you still thinking well you know
[1:35:44] I'd still be back there and I'd be doing
[1:35:46] pretty good you know you'd still be
[1:35:51] asleep a revival to the bride and the
[1:36:01] world will never see it God is not
[1:36:09] farthing he promised a revival for the
[1:36:15] bride now you show me were it came and
[1:36:21] has ended I'll show you where it came
[1:36:27] and show you that it is never ended
[1:36:31] that's what's going on now maybe it'll
[1:36:36] encourage you to read and study and
[1:36:38] listen to your prophet because you see
[1:36:41] he's the one that has the answer a
[1:36:47] revival to the bride
[1:36:55] prophet said he promised it and he'll
[1:36:58] send it but who's gonna be listening for
[1:37:03] I don't believe there be another revival
[1:37:10] I don't either not the way you're
[1:37:12] talking about cuz they'll never be
[1:37:14] another sweet world wife sleep in
[1:37:16] revival the next one is to the Jews but
[1:37:22] why can't you believe that the day that
[1:37:24] God spoke to you and showed you water
[1:37:26] baptism that that was a revival in your
[1:37:29] soul why can't you believe when he
[1:37:31] showed you one God and begin to give you
[1:37:34] understanding of those things that that
[1:37:36] was revival in your soul can't you
[1:37:38] believe that when he showed you that the
[1:37:40] new birth was a revelation of Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ personally to you why can't you
[1:37:45] see that's a revival in your soul when
[1:37:47] he showed you the seven thunders would
[1:37:49] be the revelation and attained in the
[1:37:50] seven seals and it would be these
[1:37:52] divinely revealed mystery truth that
[1:37:53] literally turned our hearts back that
[1:37:56] don't make a river Havel I go every day
[1:38:00] looking Lord what else now well you want
[1:38:09] me to bring next because I'm just
[1:38:16] waiting on you ain't waiting like you
[1:38:20] wait I ain't down into our port waiting
[1:38:23] on the bus right I'm trying my best to
[1:38:29] be at the place I'm supposed to be and
[1:38:33] then he can move on to say are you
[1:38:36] expecting a revival bro Dale little run
[1:38:39] said they'll come such a baptism of the
[1:38:41] Holy Ghost that will fill every fiber of
[1:38:43] our being and take us in the rapture
[1:38:48] what are you expecting I could stand
[1:38:52] here till midnight talking about the
[1:38:54] things that I'm expecting they see I
[1:39:00] don't worry
[1:39:01] that's what brother we'd been a bunch of
[1:39:04] years ago and the ministries meeting who
[1:39:06] is having they said their sign brother
[1:39:08] Dale atopic he can speak
[1:39:09] because they couldn't do it I've never
[1:39:16] had one thing and that's God's gift you
[1:39:19] tell me what to preach and you call the
[1:39:21] scripture let's see if God can do it
[1:39:27] that makes an exalted state no no that
[1:39:31] makes how much confidence that I have in
[1:39:33] God that I don't care who I preached
[1:39:37] before or what I do
[1:39:39] I preach what I believe and I'm not
[1:39:43] afraid of anything I just tell what I
[1:39:50] believe and why I believe it cause it's
[1:39:55] in God's Word
[1:39:56] why shouldn't we have the answer to all
[1:39:58] the questions
[1:39:59] that's what used to get me years ago
[1:40:02] somebody say something about answer to
[1:40:04] what brother Branham said be wire them
[1:40:08] and how to answered all the questions
[1:40:12] Conn the phrase beware of them that
[1:40:15] don't have no answers at all that right
[1:40:21] women women you sisters should know this
[1:40:27] message enough until you could sit down
[1:40:30] and explain things from the message
[1:40:33] because what have you been doing all I
[1:40:37] supposed to do was how babies good for
[1:40:40] you I hoped and pray to God that's true
[1:40:46] but I'll remind you of a lady that had
[1:40:49] 17 kids I believe that's right in John
[1:40:53] Wesley's mother 17 kids and she had all
[1:40:58] of the washing to do didn't know washing
[1:41:00] dry seeing all those things to do and
[1:41:03] she took one hour a day to teach them
[1:41:07] the Word of God don't sound like she had
[1:41:14] an easy round she brought one of Charles
[1:41:18] and John and what was the other one I
[1:41:20] know there was three of them they were
[1:41:22] vitally you
