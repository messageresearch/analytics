[10:49] you you're not supposed to even joke and
[10:52] cut up with one another
[10:59] what you say what you saying what kind
[11:01] of job I'm talking about the captain
[11:02] jokes that's just a sense of humor I'm
[11:05] telling jokes right you know one thing
[11:08] you know joking about maybe something
[11:10] that's fiction a fiction joke but you
[11:13] know but to tell something is true that
[11:16] happened you know anything happening
[11:19] it's just funny in life in other words
[11:22] you know how many this thing happened
[11:23] and find that funny life I tell the
[11:25] story of mosa I don't want them I got
[11:28] the attitude I was looking in the mirror
[11:29] I waited about 270 pounds and I was
[11:32] flexed
[11:46] and the devil will say look at this you
[11:50] have Tony Atlas
[11:54] and my wife walked in there and she says
[11:56] to me
[11:57] I hope you don't think you look good
[12:02] Eagles
[12:09] this thing ain't really happy but even
[12:11] the ones but see people we we all got a
[12:14] sense of humor and brothers ain't even
[12:15] God got us to you but when he come now
[12:18] to make another lying jokes and things
[12:21] yeah
[12:25] not the joke that we want to see God
[12:28] will make you give and count for every
[12:31] other word that you speak do not do that
[12:33] the Bible said that you have to give an
[12:36] account forever out of work so what what
[12:39] kind of people we ought to be people
[12:41] that frankly Stern love and sweet kind
[12:45] never never a bunch of nonsense always
[12:49] going along so we got to bring it to the
[12:52] point that Lord I'm trying to get my
[12:54] mind in order I'm trying to keep us out
[12:57] here the best thing for me to know if I
[12:59] don't see it in the word let me leave it
[13:01] alone
[13:03] we don't want to kill
[13:05] it but that's the question is
[13:08] old people just saying the only thing
[13:11] that we got that we know is true is you
[13:13] know the Holy Spirit we can hear these
[13:16] outer words outliness come here uh Jesus
[13:19] is coming on a uh this year and somebody
[13:21] trying to put a date on it somebody say
[13:23] he's out in the desert I mean they don't
[13:25] even go out there and bleed that he said
[13:27] that's an outer word how did they say
[13:29] he's in the secret bride tree chamber he
[13:31] tell her not to even bleed him please
[13:35] because where are you he's not in the
[13:37] secret bride trailer he's not in the
[13:39] desert he's in you
[13:42] so we just need us God to Open the Eyes
[13:45] of My Heart and let me see Jesus Christ
[13:48] in me and you know we need to see Jesus
[13:51] Christ everyone the only way I want to
[13:53] see Jesus Christ I gotta find somebody
[13:55] with the baptism that only goes right I
[13:57] gotta find somebody that got the word on
[14:00] the inside somebody that praising God
[14:02] that's not how to work
[14:05] come out of your mouth you ever bless a
[14:08] curse
[14:10] you know something that we don't
[14:12] understand how powerful words is we
[14:15] don't realize this this
[14:17] somebody you know sometimes we got
[14:19] somebody that we against
[14:21] you know and then you know we don't
[14:23] realize what we say and we shouldn't we
[14:26] should and we got somebody with this we
[14:28] need to get on our knees and pray to God
[14:30] to take and give me created me a clean
[14:33] heart so I can deal with it so we'll see
[14:35] that person that we're against and the
[14:37] first time we shake his head what we say
[14:39] God bless you but you do not bless him
[14:44] right and he didn't get going better

[17:32] in you and remember to say if you ever
[17:34] recognize who you are he said you could

[17:47] they say how you feel I'm sick
[17:50] Ness the sickness to say that you're

[18:16] I gotta go do that right Lord let me get
[18:19] control of my tongue
[18:21] and the only thing they can control the
[18:23] tongue is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:26] I preached a message years ago
[18:30] don't nobody ever preaching him but the
[18:31] one thing the message I picked years ago
[18:34] that well what Adam lost control of was
[18:38] the power of his children
[18:41] because Adam was created to speak the
[18:43] word that's right and Adam lost control
[18:45] of the power to speak right Adam should
[18:48] have been able to speak and the devil
[18:51] should have left
[18:52] Adam had power to get rid of the devil
[18:55] right right do you realize that
[18:57] all of them had bubble to get rid of the
[18:59] devil animal giving you Dominion on the
[19:02] fishes I'm giving you the meaning of the

[19:18] anymore it wouldn't have been no such
[19:20] thing as a devil right he had the word
[19:23] to speak about existence and if God gave
[19:25] him that dominionship my God giving you
[19:28] the same dominionship he giving you
[19:30] power over the flesh over the devil and
[19:32] over the world now how are you gonna

[20:03] world you've got to start telling your
[20:05] faces
[20:07] you want your body amen you want your
[20:11] body exactly I told you no I believe I
[20:14] told this the last time I was here but
[20:16] didn't I tell her
[20:17] I said when I was a when I was not you
[20:20] before I was saved winning my main thing
[20:23] I went to football playing fan I win the
[20:26] baseball fan
[20:28] you know I didn't done no things never
[20:30] really interest me
[20:32] I was into boxing
[20:35] I love boxing
[20:42] this little box
[20:44] and uh one of my greatest
[20:47] the most man I admired the most when I
[20:50] was in the world and I was into the
[20:52] boxing the man I gave the most respect
[20:55] for
[20:56] he was calling this up the greatest
[20:58] anybody's doing now
[21:00] that's right old man Muhammad Ali
[21:04] I said what made him the greatest
[21:07] it ain't because somebody told him he
[21:09] was great
[21:16] at himself right he told himself I am
[21:20] the greatest right that's all you have
[21:24] to do tell yourself that real name you
[21:26] don't have to be defeated by
[21:27] circumstances
[21:31] all you need to do tell yourself I am
[21:33] great right man Muhammad Ali declared to
[21:36] the world I am the greatest I am the
[21:39] champion of the world
[21:46] what is he talking about what made him
[21:48] think he's the greatest he believed it
[21:50] right he believed that he was the
[21:52] greatest and because he believed it his
[21:56] body was the coming subject to that
[21:59] confession now a confession is something
[22:02] you don't change right so when Muhammad
[22:04] Ali got defeated
[22:06] he never accepted the TV right all right
[22:10] he never got down in the body and he
[22:13] never went back on his testimony he got
[22:16] up because he did not realize he would
[22:19] have been beat
[22:21] he didn't realize that he was defeated
[22:23] right so when he got back up since he
[22:26] didn't realize anything he declared
[22:28] himself I'm still great
[22:30] he said but maybe you just got beat but
[22:32] he didn't know it right now how can you
[22:34] get beat by the devil when you don't
[22:36] know it right how the only reason you
[22:38] can be you know you got to be and you
[22:40] get up and you can think that the devil
[22:42] knock you down honey
[22:45] he did not get back I've been beat yeah
[22:52] you know and he didn't even know what
[22:55] you know he didn't even have the message
[22:57] you had he believed in a different Bible
[23:00] did you believe but he had favored what
[23:03] he believed
[23:04] and he took his confession and he made
[23:07] his body come subject to that right
[23:10] and only not only did Muhammad Ali
[23:14] believe it that he was the greatest come
[23:17] on
[23:19] for Muhammad Ali will be fighting if you
[23:22] ever seen him being fighting
[23:24] you stand up in your mouth I'm glad to
[23:25] beat you
[23:27] he always be leaning on a man like this
[23:30] and you think he just leaning he not
[23:32] resting he's killing this man in this
[23:34] Earth I'm the greatest
[24:00] George Foreman said when he fight
[24:02] Muhammad Ali
[24:04] George Foreman says he would hit
[24:07] Muhammad Ali with everything he had he's
[24:10] always giving Muhammad Ali my best and
[24:13] he says to enjoy Fullman
[24:37] be quiet
[24:41] all right I need this in the wild you
[24:43] got it right to confess
[24:44] all right all right
[24:47] Muhammad Ali me
[24:50] the intimate belief
[24:52] he made his opponent confessed that he
[24:55] was greatest
