[15:35] now father we we just commit ourselves
[15:37] and myself into your hands Lord use my
[15:40] lips Lord Jesus to speak according to
[15:42] the Oracles of God and we ask these
[15:44] things now in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:46] Christ amen amen praise the Lord Jesus
[15:50] just reading John chapter 8 amen I want
[15:53] to title this neither do I condemn thee
[15:56] those are very familiar words amen
[15:59] because it was the King of Kings amen
[16:01] who said them amen and that is what he's
[16:04] saying to you this afternoon amen amen
[16:06] neither does he condemn thee amen if you
[16:10] have done what you were supposed to do
[16:12] amen there is now no condemnation to
[16:15] those that are in Christ Jesus now to no
[16:19] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[16:22] Jesus because if he would have left it
[16:24] as as as there is no condemnation then
[16:27] just go ahead and do what you want to do
[16:29] you see but there is now no condemnation
[16:33] to those who are in Christ Jesus right
[16:36] and so we're going to read here about
[16:37] the woman uh the woman that was caught
[16:39] in
[16:40] adultery and this sparked my attention
[16:44] this week because if you remember
[16:46] brother hos who was here this past
[16:48] Sunday from Honduras he has a powerful
[16:50] testimony that's just a little minute
[16:52] portion of of what he said because due
[16:55] to time but he he he was he was
[16:59] backsliding for for for a while he was
[17:01] born and raised in this message and he
[17:04] was backsliding for a while and and we
[17:06] were we've been praying for him for
[17:07] several years and uh the family has
[17:10] Brethren there in Honduras have and um
[17:13] he came back to the Lord he just
[17:15] couldn't get
[17:17] away last year early last year the Lord
[17:20] he said I I just I need to stop running
[17:21] from the Lord and prayer was answered it
[17:24] took it took almost 10 years but prayer
[17:26] was answered and uh
[17:29] and so he got to a level of maturity you
[17:31] know where he said you know I I just
[17:33] can't I got to stop running from the
[17:35] Lord and so and and the things that that
[17:38] that he said you know many of the times
[17:39] that I dealt with him over the phone in
[17:41] the past several years that I've talked
[17:44] with him yeah I do counseling over the
[17:46] phone
[17:47] too with the Brethren uh in in in the in
[17:51] the uh outside of this outside of this
[17:54] country you know they they call and so
[17:57] you know you want to you want to help
[17:58] him out but he was he was a special one
[18:00] to me because you know he was young and
[18:02] I know what the Lord had done in his
[18:04] life be before and so I knew it was
[18:06] nothing but Satan he got carried out he
[18:09] he got a girl pregnant and he had two
[18:11] children by her and everything but uh he
[18:14] knew that he was doing wrong the whole
[18:16] time and what was hindering him from
[18:18] coming back was this exact same thing
[18:22] condemnation he he felt like like like
[18:25] like he had just done so much that he
[18:28] could not come back and you
[18:31] see if if he would have just kept that
[18:34] and stayed that way amen I wouldn't have
[18:36] received the blessing that I got by him
[18:38] telling me his testimony that he did
[18:40] this past weekend so you see we all have
[18:42] our our our we all have to go through
[18:45] certain things in our lives Amen in
[18:47] order for us to be able to have a
[18:49] testimony you see and there's no test
[18:52] and there's nothing that you went
[18:53] through there's really no testimony that
[18:55] you can give he's got a testimony and so
[18:57] ever since he's come back Satan has been
[18:59] trying to kill him especially with that
[19:02] car accident that he had different
[19:04] things have been happening I believe God
[19:06] has something special for him so and
[19:09] looking at this uh uh this scripture
[19:11] right here it it just it amazes I'll
[19:14] never look at this scripture the same
[19:15] again amen and I hope that tonight amen
[19:18] that that that that you see what I see
[19:21] amen because when I was looking at this
[19:24] and I saw some of the things that that
[19:26] that that that that we're about to read
[19:28] here I I I just seeing some things just
[19:31] coming down here to church I felt like
[19:32] shouting in the
[19:34] van it was it was so good amen so I hope
[19:37] that that that you receive the same
[19:39] blessing that I reive amen and the ones
[19:41] that are not here well they they just
[19:42] missed out then praise the lord well
[19:45] let's read John chapter 8 amen it says
[19:49] Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives and
[19:52] early in the morning he came again in
[19:54] the temple and all the people came unto
[19:57] him and he sat down down and taught them
[20:00] and the scribes and Pharisees brought
[20:02] unto him a woman taken in adultery which
[20:07] was a bad thing it was it was a it was a
[20:09] top sin adultery it was a sexual sin and
[20:13] when they had set her in the midst they
[20:16] say unto him Master the woman was taken
[20:20] in adultery in the very
[20:23] act now Moses in the law commanded us
[20:27] that such should be stoned but what
[20:31] sayest thou and so verse six says this
[20:34] they said tempting him that they might
[20:37] have to accuse him but Jesus stooped
[20:40] down and with his finger wrote on the
[20:44] ground as though he heard them not and
[20:47] the Bible doesn't say that he didn't
[20:49] hear them he was just acting like he
[20:51] wasn't listening to him but he was
[20:52] hearing everything he they were saying
[20:54] amen praise the Lord with that you may
[20:56] be
[20:57] seated
[20:59] amen and we'll just we'll continue
[21:01] reading this here in just a moment amen
[21:04] now brother brandom says here in the in
[21:06] the message the God's power to transform
[21:08] he says the following he says and God
[21:10] can write God wrote the Ten
[21:14] Commandments amen with his own
[21:17] finger he wrote on the walls of Babylon
[21:20] once
[21:22] amen with his
[21:25] finger he stooped down and wrote In hand
[21:28] one time with his finger and he was
[21:31] talking about BR was talking about this
[21:32] particular scenario God can speak God
[21:36] Can Read God can write God is the
[21:40] Fountain of all Grace and power and of
[21:45] all Divine wisdom is in God so therefore
[21:49] knowing that he is the only Creator
[21:51] there is there is no other Creator but
[21:54] God Satan cannot create at all he only
[21:58] perverts what's been created but God is
[22:01] the only
[22:02] Creator amen so God we know he is the
[22:05] Fountain of all Grace and power amen
[22:09] praise the Lord Jesus I'm so thankful
[22:11] that we have a God that that is full of
[22:13] grace and mercy and and and I believe
[22:16] that he has more grace than we even
[22:17] attribute him to even having amen
[22:20] because in our minds and in our in our
[22:22] carnal Natures amen we are condemners y
[22:26] right by Nature we are that's right oh
[22:29] we we're just condemners and and we like
[22:31] it because it makes the flesh feel
[22:35] good but you'll be surprised amen who's
[22:37] going to be in heaven and who won't be
[22:39] in heaven that day it'll be more people
[22:41] than you think amen that'll be there
[22:44] amen that will enter in and receive
[22:45] eternal life than what you and I think
[22:47] that will be there because God is all
[22:50] about the saving of the Soul amen God is
[22:53] all about amen Grace extending mercy and
[22:56] extending Grace praise praise God he's a
[22:59] god of Second Chances third chances and
[23:01] fourth chances
[23:03] amen he is a God Amen of Grace amen and
[23:07] I believe that that that in this hour
[23:09] amen when you've fully come in and
[23:11] you've accepted that Grace amen then
[23:14] what happens that Grace is going to make
[23:17] you walk in his
[23:18] statues you see with a a person that is
[23:21] not shown Grace if you just give them
[23:24] the rod of iron and the rod of of of of
[23:27] of uh uh you know
[23:30] punishment then that's they're not going
[23:33] to experience Grace they're not going to
[23:35] they're not going to walk they're not
[23:36] going to want to walk by the law uh by
[23:39] the word they're not going to want to go
[23:40] to church amen they're not going to want
[23:43] to do these things amen that can they
[23:45] can do on their own if someone shows
[23:48] Grace and this is exactly what happened
[23:51] here in the in in in in in this example
[23:53] that we're we're just reading Jesus
[23:56] showed the grace first then he explained
[23:59] to her he he he didn't he didn't justify
[24:02] her sin he knew that she had sinned he
[24:05] says he said he told her at the end go
[24:07] and sin no more so he knew that he had
[24:10] done it he knew that those priests were
[24:13] right but there was nobody else Amen to
[24:16] condemn her there because those priests
[24:17] weren't condemning her and neither was
[24:19] Jesus the god of Creator who created her
[24:22] amen and probably saw the whole scene in
[24:24] his mind amen knew that she amen that
[24:27] had done it but God's grace was there
[24:30] amen so if if if we read there in and
[24:33] starting at verse one again we'll just
[24:35] kind of go verse by verse it says Jesus
[24:37] went unto the Mount of Olives and early
[24:39] in the morning he came again into the
[24:41] temple and all the people came unto him
[24:44] and he sat down and taught them I want
[24:46] you to to to to to see the the setting
[24:49] where they're at Jesus is in the temple
[24:53] teaching the people it's key that he
[24:56] that he's in the temple because of
[24:57] something something that we're going to
[24:58] we're going to see here in just a moment
[25:01] amen he was in the temple teaching the
[25:03] people he could have been anywhere else
[25:05] teaching the people but he went to the
[25:07] temple to to uh and and sat down and
[25:10] taught them and it says here and the
[25:12] scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a
[25:15] woman unto him where in the
[25:19] temple a woman taken in adultery and you
[25:22] you can imagine this this this woman was
[25:26] probably I mean I don't know maybe she
[25:27] was she was uh taken and she was
[25:29] probably in and wrapped around in a bed
[25:31] sheet I don't know maybe she was she was
[25:33] naked the Bible doesn't say but she was
[25:35] just sat there right in front of Jesus
[25:38] and and these Pharisees didn't care not
[25:40] one bit about her they didn't care they
[25:43] just they were out to get Jesus they
[25:45] didn't care anything about her right
[25:48] brother and if you keep reading if you
[25:50] keep reading in just a moment as we're
[25:52] going to keep reading they honest they
[25:53] really even though they knew the law
[25:56] they really didn't even care about about
[25:57] the
[25:58] law they knew the law you couldn't tell
[26:01] you couldn't tell them that they didn't
[26:02] know the law they knew the law of Moses
[26:05] like the back of their hand but did they
[26:07] follow it it's one thing knowing and to
[26:10] another thing and another thing obeying
[26:12] it you see praise God you and me amen
[26:14] could know this word we know what we got
[26:16] to do we know that we have to repent and
[26:19] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[26:20] Jesus Christ but if you don't go and do
[26:22] it that won't serve you it won't help
[26:24] you at all amen these Pharisees wearing
[26:27] the same condition amen and and and we
[26:30] have a lot of a lot of young people and
[26:32] we have a lot of people amen they know
[26:34] what they got to do they've been taught
[26:37] well they just don't go and do
[26:40] it and the Pharisees were exact same
[26:43] condition right they knew what they had
[26:45] to do they knew the law but they just
[26:48] loved themselves
[26:50] more they loved themselves more amen and
[26:53] the scribes and Pharisees brought unto
[26:55] him a woman taken in adultery
[26:58] and when they had set her in the midst
[27:00] he man I I you know you asked the
[27:02] question how did these Pharisees know
[27:05] where this woman
[27:06] was this is a legitimate question how
[27:10] did these Pharisees know where this
[27:11] woman was because you and me amen we we
[27:15] know that in this world I mean this this
[27:17] this is a perverted nation that we live
[27:19] in and we we know that this this nation
[27:22] is is sinful and sexually sinful amen
[27:27] but we don't know who's committing
[27:28] adultery and who's not yeah right how
[27:31] how did these Pharisees know that this
[27:33] woman where she was at committing
[27:36] adultery and and and second the the
[27:40] other thing is that why did they not
[27:43] bring the man that she was committing
[27:45] adultery
[27:49] with so either she was being set
[27:53] up or maybe the man was one of the
[27:56] Pharisees
[27:58] right so they probably took advantage
[28:01] amen at that moment to say okay let's
[28:03] use this Amen to get to get at Jesus
[28:06] because we've been wanting to get Jesus
[28:07] for a while so let's use this amen uh
[28:12] and they use that woman like she was
[28:14] trash can you imagine that the most
[28:17] religious people of the
[28:19] day only thinking about themselves using
[28:22] this woman like trash before the god of
[28:25] creation amen amen to to to to to let
[28:29] the people know hey this isn't the
[28:30] Messiah right amen just watch they say
[28:34] unto him master and they use flattering
[28:37] words
[28:38] Master this woman was taken in adultery
[28:42] in the very
[28:44] act
[28:47] amen now Moses in verse 5 now Moses in
[28:50] the law commanded us that such should be
[28:54] stoned but what sayest thou now really
[28:57] if you look at it they were only given
[29:00] him half
[29:01] truth because when you go back and read
[29:05] the law amen this is what Moses said in
[29:07] the law if you're reading Deuteronomy
[29:10] chapter 22 now you stay with me okay
[29:13] Deuteronomy chap
[29:16] 22:22 it says this if a man be found
[29:22] lying with a
[29:24] woman it was talking about the man right
[29:27] lying with the
[29:29] woman now a man usually is the one who
[29:32] has the the the upper hand over the
[29:35] woman right so if a man be found lying
[29:39] with a woman married to an
[29:41] husband then they shall both of them die
[29:47] both the man that lay with the woman and
[29:51] the woman so shalt thou put away evil
[29:55] from Israel that was the reason why God
[29:57] God told Moses Amen in the law to let
[30:00] the people of Israel know this is this
[30:02] is got this is so that you can know and
[30:05] understand and even your children know
[30:08] that this evil is not put up with cuz
[30:11] even in the law in in the Ten
[30:12] Commandments God's one of The
[30:14] Commandments Thou shalt not commit
[30:16] adultery so God hates adultery and God
[30:20] hates an adulterous spirit amen right so
[30:23] so so we see here also in Leviticus 20:
[30:28] 10 remember this is a man being caught
[30:31] in adultery both of these verses that
[30:34] we're reading and the man that
[30:36] committeth adultery with another man's
[30:39] wife it keeps saying a man that
[30:42] committeth adultery with another man's
[30:44] wife you could say you could easily say
[30:47] oh that's just a the the man a man which
[30:49] represents a man and a woman no but it
[30:51] says the man that committed adultery
[30:53] with another man's wife right even he
[30:58] even he that committeth adultery with
[31:01] his neighbor's wife the
[31:04] adulterer right the adulterer which is
[31:06] the man and the adulteress shall surely
[31:10] be be put to
[31:13] death my goodness I'm glad I didn't live
[31:16] in that time I'm glad here in America
[31:19] they're not living in there in that time
[31:20] too cuz they'd be a lot of stonings out
[31:22] there on the
[31:24] streets there'd be a lot of stonings out
[31:26] here
[31:28] in in the world can you imagine amen
[31:32] that I don't know how they come up with
[31:33] the with the 8 billion people in the
[31:35] world Amen but can you imagine it'd
[31:37] certainly be much less than 8 billion
[31:39] [Laughter]
[31:42] people there's a lot of that that goes
[31:44] on Amen but thank God for the blood of
[31:47] Jesus Christ amen thank God for his
[31:50] grace
[31:52] amen and so we keep here so we see here
[31:55] amen that these Pharisees they brought
[31:57] this woman with no man they said to her
[32:01] they said to Jesus the law says the law
[32:04] of Moses says to Stone to Stone her but
[32:07] in reality what the law of Moses was
[32:08] saying if the man is caught with a woman
[32:13] not if the woman is caught with the man
[32:16] right you just read it with me so the
[32:18] Pharisees they were twisting the
[32:21] scriptures
[32:23] Amen in order to obtain what they wanted
[32:25] to obtain right
[32:28] this they said tempting verse six back
[32:30] in John chapter 8 this they said
[32:32] tempting him that they might have to
[32:35] accuse him amen so we know that we know
[32:39] saints that we we have an
[32:42] accuser amen the accuser of the Brethren
[32:45] amen he's always there we know it's
[32:47] nothing but Satan he's the one amen when
[32:50] you feel like you don't want to go to
[32:52] church or when you feel like you you you
[32:54] just can't keep serving God and you
[32:57] feeling you're feeling like I don't know
[32:58] if I should keep walking in this way
[33:00] what am I doing he man i' just rather go
[33:02] back in the world you know what that's
[33:03] Satan talking to you and that's not God
[33:06] Amen that is not God at all that that's
[33:09] Satan amen trying to derail your your
[33:12] your walk with him with
[33:14] God he's the accuser he accuses us
[33:17] before before him day and night amen but
[33:19] I'm thankful that he is the high priest
[33:21] amen that he's interceding for us amen
[33:25] and there's a bumper of blood amen that
[33:27] he can't go through amen because all God
[33:29] is seeing is that bumper of blood he
[33:32] doesn't see you amen per se but he sees
[33:35] you through the blood amen if you are
[33:37] under the blood amen praise the Lord
[33:40] Jesus I'm thankful for the blood you
[33:43] know brother Bram said that they were
[33:44] taking the blood out of the hym books
[33:46] amen back back in his day amen but I I I
[33:50] I can't I can't do without the blood of
[33:51] Jesus Christ amen amen amen and and
[33:55] we've said it before but you know it's
[33:56] not the literal blood amen that saves
[33:58] you but it's it's that life amen it's
[34:01] that
[34:03] representation amen that that that that
[34:06] that's what saves our soul amen praise
[34:09] God now remember that Jesus when he was
[34:13] writing here on the on on on the ground
[34:16] let's continue reading this verse it
[34:17] says here but Jesus stooped
[34:20] down and with his finger wrote on the
[34:23] ground as though he heard them not not
[34:28] now we don't know what he was writing
[34:32] the Bible doesn't say what he was
[34:34] writing there's commentaries out there
[34:37] that that that think that they might
[34:39] they might think what he might have been
[34:42] writing but nobody knows for sure
[34:45] amen but everything that we look at amen
[34:48] we should take it back to the word right
[34:50] we should take it back to the word amen
[34:53] and so Jesus was right here amen he just
[34:55] stood on the ground he just said sat
[34:57] there and was just riding on the ground
[34:59] amen I don't know maybe he was just
[35:01] maybe he was just doing this or maybe
[35:03] just I don't know what he was doing but
[35:05] he is God he's the one who created that
[35:08] dust in that Temple he's the one who
[35:11] formed the the the the ground that he
[35:13] was standing on and so he was there
[35:15] maybe just riding on the ground maybe I
[35:18] don't know he was
[35:19] riding the things that the Pharisees had
[35:22] been doing John so and so did this the
[35:25] other night uh uh uh uh uh Mark over
[35:28] there did this the other night and uh
[35:31] and maybe a few of them were taking a
[35:32] glance at that how does he know my name
[35:35] I don't know maybe but the Bible doesn't
[35:39] say and
[35:41] so we you see here that that he was
[35:45] caught amen Jesus was caught in a trap
[35:48] because they asked him what would what
[35:51] do you say the law of Moses says this
[35:53] but what do you say so now they're
[35:55] throwing it at Jes Jesus lap so now what
[35:59] do you say Jesus amen and Jesus was
[36:02] caught in in in a in a trap because if
[36:04] he would have said if he would have if
[36:06] he would have if he would have acted on
[36:07] a whim and said yeah Stone her yeah she
[36:11] deserves it amen the people that she he
[36:13] was talking to and that they loved him
[36:15] and they saw that he was merciful and
[36:17] that he was a loving God what would they
[36:19] have thought of him
[36:21] then not a gracious God not a not a
[36:25] loving father not a loving Jesus amen
[36:29] he's just a harsh amen just as harsh as
[36:32] those Pharisees is Right
[36:35] amen but then on on the other hand amen
[36:38] if he would have said no don't Stone her
[36:42] don't don't Stone her then they would
[36:44] have accused him of breaking the law
[36:47] right that's right and and and
[36:50] furthermore in just a moment the next
[36:52] scripture that we're about to read they
[36:54] would have accused cuz remember those
[36:56] Pharisees knew the the
[36:57] law but Jesus was the one who wrote the
[37:01] law so he knew it better than they did
[37:04] amen so so so let's let's read here uh
[37:09] just a moment at Numbers Chapter 5 if
[37:12] you go with me to Numbers Chapter
[37:15] 5 because when you look at Numbers
[37:17] Chapter 5 we just read in in Deuteronomy
[37:20] and Leviticus when a man was caught in
[37:23] adultery right they were both to be uh
[37:26] stoned a man and a woman but now in
[37:29] Numbers Chapter 5 this is how God dealt
[37:31] with a woman suspected to have committed
[37:34] adultery in the Old Testament how many
[37:36] want to read about
[37:38] that it it's sad but but but this is
[37:42] what this is the
[37:43] word this is what happens now I'm going
[37:47] to read to you in the NIV version so you
[37:49] can kind of understand it a little bit
[37:50] better but you can go back and read it
[37:52] in K King King James version so this is
[37:55] for the younger ones to understand a
[37:56] little a little better I'm going to try
[37:57] to go as quick as possible but try to
[37:59] concentrate here what's going
[38:02] on then the Lord said to
[38:05] Moses speak to the Israelites and say to
[38:09] them if a man's wife goes astray and is
[38:12] unfaithful to him so that another man
[38:16] has sexual relations with her and this
[38:19] is hidden from her husband and her
[38:22] impurity is undetected since there is no
[38:25] witness against against her and she has
[38:27] not been caught in the act and the
[38:30] feelings of jealousy come over her
[38:33] husband and he suspects his wife and she
[38:36] is impure or if he is jealous and
[38:39] suspects her even though she is not
[38:41] impure all right everyone's following so
[38:44] far then he is to take his wife to the
[38:48] priest he must also take an offering of
[38:51] a tenth of an epha of barley flour on
[38:54] the behalf on her behalf he must not
[38:56] pour olive oil on it or put incense on
[38:58] it because it is a grain offering for
[39:00] jealousy a reminder offering to draw
[39:02] attention to wrongdoing you know I'm I'm
[39:05] surprised I'm amazed at how many
[39:07] offerings there were in the Old
[39:08] Testament I mean there was even an
[39:10] offering of jealousy this is the
[39:12] offering of jealousy the husband got
[39:14] jealous of the wife you better take that
[39:16] to the priest I'm jealous of my wife I'm
[39:19] I'm accusing my wife of so I'm
[39:21] suspecting something Amen brother but
[39:26] before you suspected something you
[39:27] better you better provide the priest
[39:29] amen these things that that God was
[39:31] telling him that he must
[39:33] do now watch this the priest shall bring
[39:37] her well let's see he must not pour
[39:41] olive oil verse 15 on it or put incense
[39:43] on it because it is a grain offering for
[39:45] jealousy a reminder offering to draw
[39:47] attention to
[39:48] wrongdoing verse 16 the priest shall
[39:52] bring her and have her stand before the
[39:57] Lord amen the S the S the Pharisees amen
[40:00] what did they have that woman do amen
[40:02] they just threw her down Amen in front
[40:04] of Jesus Amen and Jesus being the priest
[40:08] amen the priest shall bring her and have
[40:11] her stand before the Lord before the
[40:15] Lord remember that then he shall take
[40:19] some holy water in a clay
[40:22] jar and put some dust from the
[40:25] Tabernacle floor into the water can you
[40:27] imagine amen us having a a service like
[40:31] that what kind of church service would
[40:34] that be amen when you go home amen that
[40:36] day that evening man that was an
[40:37] interesting church
[40:39] service brother Wade was over there
[40:41] putting dust in a in a in in in a bowl
[40:43] and and putting it together amen what
[40:45] was he
[40:46] concocting but this is what the Lord
[40:48] told him to do but but but I I I want
[40:51] you I want you to take a look at this
[40:53] amen because go back to what Jesus amen
[40:56] with the adulterous woman there amen
[40:58] what read this in verse 16 it says the
[41:01] priest shall bring her and have her
[41:03] stand before the Lord then he shall take
[41:06] some holy water
[41:09] amen who is that holy
[41:12] water
[41:14] Christ in a clay
[41:17] jar Christ Christ amen in a clay jar a
[41:21] vessel of clay Jesus was right there in
[41:24] a vessel of clay in human form right in
[41:27] front of this
[41:29] woman and put some dust from the
[41:31] Tabernacle floor into the water some
[41:35] dust what was Jesus doing when he was
[41:37] riding on the dust in the
[41:41] Tabernacle amen so it was it was Jesus
[41:44] amen the holy
[41:47] water The Vessel of
[41:49] clay riding in the dust in the
[41:52] Tabernacle touching the dust becoming
[41:55] one with the Dust in the Tabernacle I
[41:57] don't think that was there for for for
[41:59] just to be there this is the Pharisees
[42:02] knew that this is what they needed to do
[42:04] to this woman but they didn't use this
[42:08] scripture amen they used the other one
[42:10] about stoning about stoning her when
[42:13] really that one didn't really apply to
[42:15] her this one was the one that applied to
[42:17] her
[42:18] right I thought that was
[42:21] interesting
[42:22] amen praise
[42:25] God
[42:27] and then Verse 18 it says after the
[42:29] priest has had the woman stand before
[42:32] the Lord you know what that the
[42:34] Pharisees were there trying to prove
[42:36] that he wasn't Messiah but in them doing
[42:39] that they proved that he was the
[42:41] Messiah they what if you ever do
[42:44] anything wrong young people if you ever
[42:46] sin or do anything amen the best person
[42:49] to run to to be before is before the
[42:52] Lord amen that was the best place for
[42:55] that woman to to be before amen was
[42:58] before the Lord amen most people amen
[43:01] they want to do like Adam when they sin
[43:03] they want to run away from the presence
[43:05] of the Lord and make their own covering
[43:07] and do something about it themselves
[43:09] amen but this woman amen the priest they
[43:11] dragged her under thinking that they
[43:14] were going to do something
[43:16] uh uh you know find uh make Jesus look
[43:19] bad but in reality they were actually
[43:21] making her look
[43:23] good praise God am amen well I don't
[43:27] know it made me uh want to shout inside
[43:29] when I saw that praise the
[43:33] Lord after the priest had has had the
[43:36] woman stand before the Lord he shall
[43:38] loosen her hair and place in her hands
[43:42] the reminder offering the grain offering
[43:44] for jealousy while he himself holds the
[43:47] bitter water that brings a curse amen
[43:49] now just to make it make it short I
[43:51] could read the whole thing you could go
[43:52] back and read it your yourself amen the
[43:55] rest of the chapter basically the priest
[43:57] would take this water put this dust from
[43:59] the tab from the from the temple or from
[44:02] the from the from the temple put it in
[44:05] there mix it together and this woman
[44:06] would drink
[44:09] this and if she would drink it and and
[44:12] and and basically if she I I I if
[44:15] supernaturally because this the priest
[44:17] wasn't doing anything he was just
[44:19] obeying commands it was the Lord amen
[44:21] that was doing something right there you
[44:23] see God is the one that discerns the
[44:26] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[44:28] it's Jesus that that that discerns the
[44:29] thoughts and intents of the heart so it
[44:31] was Jesus there in that Temple that day
[44:33] he was Discerning the thoughts of the
[44:35] woman and the thoughts of those men as
[44:37] well so it was this priest would put
[44:40] this and this woman would drink it and
[44:42] if and the Bible says that if she uh she
[44:44] would it would cause a a a a scar on her
[44:48] on her thigh and uh uh and if her belly
[44:51] would swell then that means that she did
[44:54] commit the ACT but she was doing this
[44:56] before the priest the priest would ask
[44:58] her and say did you do this and if you
[45:00] if you did do this you drink this and if
[45:02] your belly swells basically almost kind
[45:06] of having like a like a miscarriage you
[45:08] know it's what it's in another
[45:10] translation if you keep reading and if
[45:12] if if she has that if that happens to
[45:14] her then that means she did do the ACT
[45:16] but if nothing
[45:17] happens then the husband would have some
[45:20] explaining to do back at
[45:23] home can you imagine both of them going
[45:25] back back home well honey I guess you're
[45:30] innocent yeah but you sleeping in the
[45:32] dogghouse for the rest of the
[45:35] year so you better know what you're
[45:37] talking about before you accuse somebody
[45:39] of anything you better have some proof
[45:43] amen cuz then it won't go well for you
[45:46] amen afterwards praise the
[45:50] Lord so this was the law of the of the
[45:53] woman amen who was
[45:56] thought that she had committed adultery
[45:58] now the in this particular scenario Here
[46:00] with Jesus the woman was caught in the
[46:03] act of adultery now whether she was set
[46:08] up or whether whatever it was the
[46:11] Pharisees knew where she was
[46:13] at so they grabbed her and and and and
[46:16] she she did the ACT amen amen praise the
[46:20] Lord now in Romans chapter 8:1 it says
[46:23] that that there is therefore now no
[46:26] condemnation Amen to them which are in
[46:29] Christ Jesus praise the Lord who walk
[46:31] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[46:33] there is therefore now no condemnation
[46:35] to them who are in Christ Jesus amen
[46:38] where was she at she was in the
[46:41] temple standing next to the
[46:44] temple she was in Christ amen there is
[46:48] therefore now no condemnation when you
[46:50] are in in his in his presence amen
[46:53] praise the Lord Satan will still try to
[46:54] bombard you with condemnation ation amen
[46:56] you're still you you you you know you
[46:58] did it God knows God knows you did it
[47:00] but as soon as you confess it amen it's
[47:02] in his SE if or for forgiveness to be
[47:05] remembered no more and I don't know how
[47:07] he does it but he does
[47:09] it and I'm thankful that he does it I
[47:13] just praise God for it amen I know many
[47:16] of you could say the same thing amen you
[47:19] know we've been talking about
[47:20] justification lately amen and and
[47:22] Justified as if you've never done it
[47:26] that kind of justification like you've
[47:28] never done it in the first place this is
[47:31] how Jesus was justifying this
[47:34] woman amen I didn't see it neither did
[47:38] they but I know you did it but don't do
[47:41] it again amen that's right and left it
[47:45] at that praise the Lord for the law of
[47:48] the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath
[47:51] made me free from the law of sin and
[47:53] death for what the law La could not do n
[47:57] you see the law could not do Amen in
[48:00] this scenario the law couldn't help her
[48:02] in this in this
[48:04] scenario but watch what what what what
[48:07] watch what's next in that it was weak
[48:09] through the
[48:10] flesh God sending his own son in the
[48:13] likeness of sinful flesh in that
[48:15] likeness of of a jar of
[48:17] clay right and for sin condemned sin in
[48:22] the flesh amen amen he didn't condemn
[48:27] her he condemned he condemned her sin
[48:31] didn't condemn her amen you and me don't
[48:34] have to we don't have to agree with with
[48:37] what the world does out here we don't
[48:38] have to agree with what people do out
[48:41] here no that's condemnable the things
[48:44] that they do we don't condemn the person
[48:47] we condemn their sin amen praise God
[48:50] that's amen that the righteousness of
[48:53] the law might be fulfilled
[48:56] in us who walk not after the flesh but
[48:59] after the spirit I thank God Amen that
[49:01] we have God himself who wrote the law
[49:04] and he was the one who was able to
[49:06] fulfill the law amen you don't have to
[49:08] fulfill it I don't have to fulfill it
[49:10] he's already fulfilled it for you praise
[49:13] the Lord
[49:14] Jesus all right so let's continue here
[49:17] in John in John chapter 8 verse 7 it
[49:19] says here now so when they continued
[49:21] asking him he lifted up himself and said
[49:24] unto them
[49:26] he that is without sin among you let him
[49:30] first cast the stone at her he didn't
[49:33] fall for their
[49:35] trap amen right how can you deceive the
[49:38] word when it were the author of the word
[49:40] when he was the one who wrote the word
[49:43] he was the one who wrote that about the
[49:45] taking the dust from the temple and
[49:47] mingling it with water amen y he was the
[49:51] one who wrote
[49:52] that so the priests were trying to make
[49:55] him looked dumb but he he said I I'm I'm
[49:58] not an
[50:00] idiot I know what I wrote that's right
[50:03] and I'm not falling for your
[50:05] trap he that is without sin among you
[50:07] let him first cast a stone at her and
[50:10] again he stooped down and wrote on the
[50:14] ground so he was continuing to mingle
[50:17] himself with that dust and they which
[50:20] heard it being convicted by their own
[50:23] conscience at least they had a
[50:25] conscience to do that man they didn't
[50:28] have enough conscience Amen to do
[50:30] whatever they they wanted to do with
[50:32] that woman or or drag her make humiliate
[50:36] her before the people they could have
[50:38] been children there they could have been
[50:40] anybody there for for all we know they
[50:43] didn't care amen they just wanted to
[50:46] make sure and get at Jesus because Jesus
[50:48] was robbing them of their
[50:51] popularity Jesus was robbing them of
[50:53] their of their trust before the
[50:56] people
[50:58] amen and they wanted to do everything
[51:00] they can to get at to get at Jesus and
[51:03] they which heard it being convicted by
[51:05] their own conscience went out one by one
[51:08] beginning at the
[51:10] eldest even unto the
[51:13] last and watch this and Jesus was left
[51:17] alone and the woman standing in the
[51:22] midst amen I want you to know saints
[51:25] that
[51:26] this walk is between you and
[51:28] Christ
[51:30] amen young people when when when when
[51:32] you f fall if you make a mistake amen
[51:36] that's between you and God God wants you
[51:39] to be in his midst God wants you to come
[51:42] to him amen so that he can do what he's
[51:46] what he paid and died for for for on the
[51:48] cross for you to do
[51:51] amen so he's got the gift ready for you
[51:54] he's got the the the the the the the the
[51:58] the antidote I guess you could say the
[52:00] the the medicine for you the problem is
[52:03] is that we don't take it but it's there
[52:05] available for you
[52:07] amen abely and so you got to have your
[52:10] alone moment with with Jesus Christ just
[52:12] like this woman had her alone moment
[52:14] amen praise the Lord when Jesus had
[52:17] lifted verse 10 and when Jesus had
[52:19] lifted up himself and saw none but the
[52:24] woman
[52:26] he said unto
[52:27] Heroman where are those thine
[52:31] accusers amen where are those that that
[52:34] brought you dragged you here maybe naked
[52:37] dragged you out here in front of them
[52:38] where are they
[52:40] at and watch what she says she says and
[52:44] then he asked her hath no man condemned
[52:46] thee in other words he wants her to to
[52:50] to to to to realize that no one condemn
[52:54] thee he wants her to reply to him amen
[52:57] yeah I'm not condemned Lord I'm I'm free
[53:00] you you got to accept your freedom
[53:02] yourself first amen but God can't set
[53:05] you free unless you realize that you are
[53:07] set free and he whom the son set free is
[53:11] free indeed but all Jesus can do amen is
[53:14] just un loose the the the the uh unlock
[53:17] the chain right you're the one who's got
[53:20] to who's who's got to walk
[53:22] free amen from your condemnation from
[53:25] the things that you have done in the
[53:27] past amen God can't do that for you he's
[53:30] done that already for you you just got
[53:32] to accept it and walk free Amen brother
[53:35] Brandon would always tell that story
[53:37] about Johnny Crow was it Johnny Crow not
[53:40] Johnny Crow but uh yeah the little the
[53:42] little crow that that always that always
[53:44] thought that that that that he was he
[53:47] was always chained you see but but but
[53:50] he wasn't you know he was he was not he
[53:53] was he was not chained up and and
[53:55] everybody all the other crows that that
[53:58] that they were flying around him and say
[53:59] hey Johnny come on and and eat corn with
[54:02] us and and be free with us and and he
[54:04] said no I'm over here just um I can't
[54:07] I'm stuck in this chain and I'll think
[54:09] I'll just die here well those those
[54:12] those crows couldn't do anything for him
[54:14] no nobody could do anything for him here
[54:16] man nobody can nobody can free you from
[54:19] that
[54:20] mindset amen if if if it's there you see
[54:25] right it's something that you have to do
[54:27] by yourself you have to come to terms
[54:30] with God you have to you have to do that
[54:32] on your own amen God's only done it up
[54:36] to a certain point but there's a part
[54:37] that you've got to do as well amen
[54:40] amen so this is what Jesus is asking her
[54:43] to do where are your accusers hath no
[54:45] man condemned thee amen and she said
[54:48] verse 11 no man
[54:50] Lord no man Lord no man has condemned me
[54:55] and Jesus said unto her uh neither do I
[55:00] condemn
[55:01] thee amen what a what beautiful words to
[55:05] hear from from the Lord himself amen
[55:09] neither do I condemn thee remember this
[55:13] is woman this woman is being shown
[55:16] grace even really before the they were
[55:20] still living under the
[55:21] law think about it at that time they
[55:24] were still living under law and this
[55:26] woman is being shown
[55:29] Grace in such a way amen that that that
[55:34] we can never understand amen because she
[55:37] did the
[55:39] deed but she she was tricked into into
[55:43] that position that she was at amen right
[55:46] God knew that Jesus knew that amen amen
[55:50] neither do I condemn thee but watch he
[55:53] doesn't justify her sin he says go and
[55:56] sin no more amen I don't condemn you no
[56:01] man here is condemning you they're gone
[56:04] they feel they they feel condemned
[56:07] themselves cuz they knew that that that
[56:11] they had sinned before and probably with
[56:13] that woman I don't
[56:15] know
[56:17] right what kind of Hypocrites are those
[56:20] I still you you really if you look at
[56:22] the life of the Pharisees I me they were
[56:25] Jesus was was just and and and ring
[56:29] against them and man the way they they
[56:31] were and the life that they lived amen
[56:34] was very very very
[56:36] hypocritical and that's why he was he
[56:38] was he was always in Con in condemnation
[56:41] mode in their life right I I know that
[56:44] there was there was probably uh you know
[56:47] he was he was merciful to to um uh the
[56:51] one that came to him by night um
[56:53] Nicodemus he showed Mercy to whoever
[56:56] wants Mercy
[56:57] right even to the
[57:00] Pharisee amen but he had a some big
[57:03] issue with with with these Pharisees
[57:05] because the people looked up to these
[57:08] people amen you know in this hour Saints
[57:11] you know we have people that all they do
[57:13] is
[57:14] condemn we got people that left this
[57:16] message amen and all they do is condemn
[57:18] the preachers that that that that that
[57:21] are in this message the people that that
[57:23] that that that still believe believe
[57:25] this message they talk about them look
[57:27] look what he said this here in this
[57:29] sermon and and this this right here and
[57:31] you know what that's the exact same
[57:33] spirit that the Pharisees
[57:36] had it's a spirit of condemnation and
[57:39] where does that Spirit come from right
[57:42] Spirit of the devil amen amen cuz Jesus
[57:47] is not around condemning but the
[57:49] Pharisees were amen but he tells her he
[57:53] says neither do I condemn me go and sin
[57:57] no more amen and so Jesus Jesus knew
[58:00] that she had sinned amen but he was now
[58:03] showing her grace before discipline and
[58:06] instruction amen amen I think that's key
[58:10] uh parents amen when be that you show
[58:13] Grace to your children amen they're
[58:15] going to they're going to make mistakes
[58:16] and they're going to do wrong amen but
[58:19] if you come at them with a point of with
[58:21] with with Grace amen and then give them
[58:25] instruction then they'll they'll be
[58:27] willing to listen to you right brother
[58:29] but what is our first reaction our
[58:31] knee-jerk reaction the knee-jerk
[58:32] reaction that Jesus had was yeah condemn
[58:34] her Stone her yeah you're right
[58:38] no he he was probably thinking about
[58:42] it right in his human in his human mind
[58:45] but him being the word amen he's like I
[58:48] know what the word
[58:49] says right and so our knee your reaction
[58:53] sometimes is is is to condemn and our
[58:56] our our daughter and our son amen they
[58:59] did something amen they deserve this
[59:01] they deserve punishment amen but what is
[59:03] the Lord trying to
[59:05] do amen what is the Lord trying to do in
[59:08] the whole situation praise God and you
[59:11] stop and think amen before you condemn
[59:13] you show Grace cuz I'm telling you
[59:15] Saints amen you're going to do much more
[59:16] showing Grace to people than than you do
[59:18] condemning people and sending them to
[59:21] hell you do more with love than you do
[59:25] with with condemning people and yes they
[59:27] broke the law and yes they don't come to
[59:29] church and yes they don't do none of
[59:31] these things amen but you show Grace to
[59:34] them you be the
[59:37] example you be the example of the one
[59:39] that does come to church you be the
[59:42] example of one that does hold the door
[59:44] for the for the elderly person that's
[59:46] walking out the door you be the example
[59:48] of the one that that that that that does
[59:51] nice things for one another Paul said be
[59:53] kind to one another
[59:55] right you be that example and that's you
[59:58] showing Grace and you know what and the
[1:00:00] one that does not is not doing it and
[1:00:02] the one that you think is rebellious and
[1:00:05] and and and and is just just rebellious
[1:00:08] and
[1:00:10] obnoxious maybe they'll see your example
[1:00:13] yeah and say you know what and you may
[1:00:16] not know that they even even thought
[1:00:19] that but later on in their life they
[1:00:22] they you know what I learned that from
[1:00:24] Brothers so and so but he never said
[1:00:27] anything to me about it I just saw his
[1:00:29] life I just saw him doing it one time I
[1:00:32] just saw her doing it one time amen
[1:00:36] that's why our actions amen speak louder
[1:00:39] than
[1:00:40] words that's very true amen Jesus
[1:00:44] actions amen spoke louder than any
[1:00:46] condemnation that he could ever do amen
[1:00:50] and what do you think that woman went to
[1:00:52] do the Bible doesn't say after
[1:00:53] afterwards what happened to the woman
[1:00:56] but do you think that she really then
[1:00:59] took heart to not do that again I think
[1:01:03] so because she was shown
[1:01:06] Grace she was shown Grace amen every
[1:01:10] reminds me when brother Brandon preached
[1:01:11] marriage and divorce and we're we're
[1:01:13] we're about to finish up here remember
[1:01:15] when brother Brandon preached marriage
[1:01:16] and divorce I'm not going to preach
[1:01:17] marriage and divorce so don't don't
[1:01:21] worry but when brother Brandon preached
[1:01:23] that amen there was people there was
[1:01:26] confusion amongst the the church the
[1:01:29] church the churches you know cuz you had
[1:01:31] there in that congregation there was
[1:01:33] people that were married three four or
[1:01:35] five times had children with multiple
[1:01:37] women and different things brother
[1:01:40] Brandon knew all
[1:01:41] that and he was faced with
[1:01:45] that in brother bram's life he never
[1:01:47] condemned that because why if he would
[1:01:50] have if he would have went ahead and
[1:01:51] condemned all those people and and in
[1:01:54] their position positions and things like
[1:01:55] that amen then then he would have when
[1:01:59] he would have gotten the word from the
[1:02:00] Lord then he would have have to retract
[1:02:02] everything that he would have
[1:02:04] said he got that word from the Lord and
[1:02:06] what did the Lord
[1:02:08] show
[1:02:11] Grace Grace and some of those people are
[1:02:14] in worse conditions that we could ever
[1:02:16] be am and they were given another
[1:02:18] opportunity but here's the here's the
[1:02:20] here's what the brother banam told him
[1:02:22] he
[1:02:23] said go and don't do it and teach your
[1:02:27] children not to do it again so he he was
[1:02:31] giv them the grace first the Lord was
[1:02:34] giving the people the grace first then
[1:02:37] he gave them the instruction right go
[1:02:40] you're free stay the way you are but
[1:02:43] don't do it again right and don't and
[1:02:46] teach your children not to do it again
[1:02:49] amen Grace first then instruction why
[1:02:53] because when Grace comes first then the
[1:02:55] person that's receiving the Grace will
[1:02:57] be able to accept that instruction much
[1:02:59] easier right but when you go in there
[1:03:01] with the condemnation first and the the
[1:03:03] law says this the Bible says this you
[1:03:05] see what it says and and all that amen
[1:03:08] more than likely they won't hear you out
[1:03:10] they're already they're already upset
[1:03:12] that they got
[1:03:14] caught they're already upset and and and
[1:03:18] and and you know young people especially
[1:03:21] amen that they got caught right
[1:03:24] they don't want to be talked to amen but
[1:03:27] you show them the grace
[1:03:30] yes so your heart I love
[1:03:33] you I love you and and and and I I'll do
[1:03:37] I just want to see you that's what I
[1:03:40] told that's what I told my daughters I
[1:03:42] want to see you amen I want to walk you
[1:03:44] down the aisle to the right man right
[1:03:48] amen that that's what I want to see amen
[1:03:51] and I love you and
[1:03:53] and I just care so much about
[1:03:56] you they'll be
[1:04:04] melting it
[1:04:06] helps because why it helps
[1:04:09] me when God speaks to me that
[1:04:12] way and then I can read his word and I
[1:04:15] say well yes the word says not to do
[1:04:17] that this this this this Lord I believe
[1:04:21] your word amen praise God and this is
[1:04:24] what this woman received what a great
[1:04:26] God that we serve
[1:04:29] amen praise the
[1:04:33] Lord so you know and I'm not giving you
[1:04:37] I'm not giving a license to go do
[1:04:39] whatever you this Jesus clearly
[1:04:41] condemned her act he told her don't sin
[1:04:45] anymore don't do it
[1:04:47] again but he didn't condemn
[1:04:50] her where are thine
[1:04:53] accusers I don't see them Lord neither
[1:04:56] do I condemn thee right amen I want to
[1:04:59] hear those words amen every time I go to
[1:05:02] Jesus and and then next the following
[1:05:05] week when Satan is is bombarding me with
[1:05:08] look what I did the week before and and
[1:05:10] look
[1:05:11] and and I go to the Lord Lord help me
[1:05:15] help me I I still can't Jesus is saying
[1:05:17] I don't I don't know what you're talking
[1:05:19] about amen you know one of the things
[1:05:22] that really struck me about hos when he
[1:05:24] was telling me his
[1:05:25] testimony he was he was telling me he
[1:05:28] was telling me
[1:05:29] uh you know he he was saying he was
[1:05:33] fighting that thing of condemnation you
[1:05:35] know and he was just telling he was
[1:05:37] telling the Lord he got
[1:05:39] down prayed to the Lord and he said Lord
[1:05:42] help me to just forget these things the
[1:05:45] way you forget about them help me to
[1:05:48] forget the the the the the things that I
[1:05:51] have done even the the the the woman
[1:05:54] that that I did these things with helped
[1:05:56] me to even forget
[1:05:58] her you know she's she's the she's the
[1:06:01] person uh I want her soul to be saved as
[1:06:04] well but help me to forget about about
[1:06:07] these things he said that the he said he
[1:06:10] went to sleep that one night he right
[1:06:12] before he went to bed he prayed that and
[1:06:14] he just he said he was just sobbing
[1:06:17] before the Lord and he went to bed and
[1:06:19] he said the following day he woke up he
[1:06:21] said brother Luis you won't believe it
[1:06:23] it felt like it was like I woke up like
[1:06:25] I was a a a like a big weight was lifted
[1:06:29] off my
[1:06:31] chest and and and and and he said that
[1:06:34] he had forgotten uh U he it's not that
[1:06:38] he didn't he he says it's not that I
[1:06:40] don't care about the the the the his his
[1:06:42] girl's Mom it's not that you know but it
[1:06:46] but it's just like it has nothing
[1:06:49] nothing he can forget about her easily
[1:06:52] which in turn forgets about the things
[1:06:54] that he has done you know it's not upon
[1:06:57] him anymore you
[1:06:59] see and so God heard that prayer gave
[1:07:02] him freedom and that was that freedom
[1:07:04] that he needed so that he can continue
[1:07:06] with his walk with God
[1:07:08] Amen and so God can do that for you
[1:07:11] young people God can do that for you
[1:07:13] even adults amen we we experience
[1:07:16] condemnation just as much as you all do
[1:07:19] why because we've we've lived a bit
[1:07:21] longer and we've done more things dumb
[1:07:23] things than than you have and we're just
[1:07:25] here trying to warn you and so that you
[1:07:28] don't go that
[1:07:29] way you don't have to go that way young
[1:07:32] people cuz we already did it for you we
[1:07:35] know what it's
[1:07:36] like and so you so that you don't have
[1:07:39] to do it but what a greater thing is is
[1:07:41] that he's already done it for
[1:07:43] you amen he's already paid the price for
[1:07:46] you so even if you do fall make mistakes
[1:07:50] there's a way out there's a way of
[1:07:52] Escape Lord there's a way amen he's in
[1:07:55] the
[1:07:55] temple you just got to be before him go
[1:07:59] before him he's right there ready and
[1:08:02] saying neither do I condemn thee amen
