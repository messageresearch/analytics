[28:17] would never leave
[28:20] them sometimes we think of the children
[28:24] as though they're not being just there
[28:27] with us
[28:29] but um you know the things you say to
[28:32] them the things you say about them and
[28:35] the liberty and latitude that you have
[28:38] given to them right will always be there
[28:40] with them amen so you know that's
[28:42] important uh you know Jesus it was that
[28:45] says you suffer the little children to
[28:47] come unto me amen and forbid them not
[28:50] for of such is a kingdom of God Amen and
[28:54] wh soever cannot accept accept the king
[28:57] kingdom of God

[33:07] 5 let this mind being you which was also
[33:11] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[33:14] God thought it not robbery to be equal
[33:17] that's right with God amen amen but made
[33:19] himself of no reputation and took upon
[33:22] him the form of a servant and was made
[33:25] in the likeness of man yes sir and being
[33:27] found found in fashion as a man he
[33:30] humbled himself and be obedient unto
[33:33] death even the death of the Cross am in
[33:37] Ephesians chapter
[33:39] 1 verse
[33:43] 4 we know that the scripture very
[33:47] well according as he has chosen Us in
[33:50] him before the foundation of the world
[33:53] that we we should be holy and Without
[33:56] Blame before him in love right having
[33:59] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[34:01] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[34:04] according to the good pleasure of his
[34:07] will to the praise of the glory of his
[34:10] grace wherein he has made us accepted in
[34:15] the Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[34:18] through his blood the the Forgiveness of
[34:20] sins according to the riches of his
[34:23] grace wherein he has abound towards us
[34:26] in all wisdom
[34:28] and Prudence having made known unto us
[34:31] the mystery the Bible says he has made
[34:34] it known unto us the mystery of his will
[34:39] according to his good pleasure which he
[34:42] has purposed in himself may the Lord his
[34:45] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[34:47] may be
[34:49] seated you know we we we preach of uh
[34:53] adoption I I'd like to speak for a
[34:56] little bit this evening on
[34:59] agents by adoption
[35:03] amen it seems like the two words doesn't
[35:06] really go
[35:09] together but the Bible reflects in the
[35:12] New Testament and the words of Jesus and
[35:16] the the the portray of the Life of
[35:19] Christ it reflects the
[35:21] ministry of the Jewish son coming into
[35:25] adoption and adoption is the placing of
[35:28] the son right you know Jesus
[35:32] Transfiguration upon the mountain you
[35:35] know the Bible says that it was so
[35:38] important that God allowed Moses and
[35:41] Elijah to come and stand by him that's
[35:44] right and then the Earthly witness yep
[35:48] Peter James and John y you know standing
[35:52] there the Bible says they were taken up
[35:54] into the mountain apart and and there he
[35:56] was transfigured before them right and
[35:59] the words this is my son he he him Amen
[36:05] in other words that adoption brings the
[36:09] words of the son in direct line to the
[36:14] words of the father right
[36:16] exactly and that adoption did not stop
[36:19] there with Jesus but it was extended to
[36:22] you and I right so much so that you know
[36:26] brother Bri said in the M Spirit of
[36:28] Truth he's interested in you and he's
[36:31] interested in me he's interested to see
[36:35] his word made manifest and he's
[36:38] depending on us to do it for we are his
[36:42] agents am Hallelujah nothing in
[36:46] ourselves we are agents but it's nothing
[36:49] in ourselves hallelujah it's him
[36:53] yielding ourselves and walking with him
[36:57] amen
[36:58] an agent the we we say and in
[37:02] law an agent they said has certain Duty
[37:06] mhm and there's a covenant to an angel
[37:09] which he cannot break as long as he's an
[37:13] agent amen and in law we we say an agent
[37:17] has a fucy duty to his client right and
[37:22] an agent is a person that is authorized
[37:25] to carry on the affair
[37:28] of
[37:29] another listen what brother bam said in
[37:31] the Queen of Sheba he said but in every
[37:35] generation God has always had his
[37:40] agents it's got down to some time to
[37:43] merely one right right but God always
[37:47] have somebody in every generation that
[37:51] he could lay his finger on some people
[37:54] that he could put his finger on and says
[37:57] uh this is my people amen and they will
[38:01] do as I tell them to do right amen they
[38:05] act not on their own but they act on the
[38:08] behalf of the Messiah
[38:11] Amen brother bream in dealing with the
[38:14] placing of a
[38:16] son looking at uh Romans there he said
[38:21] he talk about the mystery of his will he
[38:24] said remember how he hands on that how
[38:27] many he was here this morning let us see
[38:29] and he said the mystery of his will now
[38:32] it is not just a little thing that it's
[38:34] a mystery God's will is a mystery and
[38:38] each man has to seek out the will of God
[38:42] for himself or herself Hallelujah God's
[38:47] mystery you've got to seek it out for
[38:51] yourself in other words you've got to
[38:53] become so concerned that I want to know
[38:57] the will of God for my life amen is that
[39:00] all right hallelujah amen and he talks
[39:04] about the life of Paul and Paul said you
[39:07] know when I when I receive it he said I
[39:11] confer not with flesh and blood right
[39:13] neither did I go to those that were
[39:15] Apostles before me but he went to Arabia
[39:19] Paul speaks you know of his own exploits
[39:22] to the word of God now Hallelujah he
[39:26] said God at the beginning predestinated

[47:24] are there in the word of God the people
[47:27] becomes afraid even to say what is God's
[47:30] word because of what somebody's going to
[47:33] say y that's right you think of it
[47:36] between 1963 and
