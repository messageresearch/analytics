[8:53] thirsting to hear from you
[8:55] in jesus christ's name amen
[8:58] amen i'm going to be reading a lot of
[8:59] scriptures so you can be seated and
[9:01] uh we we know that we honor the word
[9:05] as we uh we do read the word standing to
[9:08] our feet but
[9:09] because i'm we'll be reading a lot of
[9:10] scriptures we'll uh we'll go on
[9:13] you know i had a little phrase i told
[9:16] the
[9:16] the guys yesterday when i was
[9:18] fellowshipping at brother bob's
[9:21] uh that uh you know i'm i was telling
[9:24] him
[9:24] you know i work in a nuclear laboratory
[9:27] i says but i'm just an old farmer that
[9:29] grew up up there
[9:30] just digging you know pounding in posts
[9:32] and
[9:33] raising cattle and and feeding pigs and
[9:36] feeding chickens and stuff like that and
[9:39] and uh
[9:40] and i said when i got a job over there i
[9:42] just faked it till i made it yeah
[9:44] and you know what i'm already i'm
[9:48] already getting to retirement
[9:50] you know i'm already getting to
[9:51] retirement but fortunately they put me
[9:53] to tear apart things
[9:55] and not put things together so i'm not
[9:58] putting together anything that's real
[9:59] serious
[10:00] but nevertheless faking it till you make
[10:03] it and then my wife went and got a job
[10:05] at the same place and she's working
[10:08] other things and i said well
[10:09] honey you gotta fake it till you make it
[10:13] she says you can't fake it till you make
[10:16] it here
[10:17] you got to know what you're doing
[10:18] because you can lose your fingers
[10:20] so i said well okay we'll try something
[10:24] else
[10:24] well in this case as we come before god
[10:27] we can't fake it till we make it
[10:29] we just got to yield ourselves so we
[10:31] realized that that's right
[10:32] amen my title of my my message that i
[10:34] want to talk about is
[10:36] it's called red sky at morning
[10:39] and uh their scriptures the scripture is
[10:41] in uh
[10:43] matthew the 16th chapter the 14th verse
[10:46] and i think i was asking brother joseph
[10:49] to keep up with me on the scripture
[10:51] reading
[10:51] at least for the first two pages amen
[10:54] and
[10:55] let's go there real quick
[10:59] okay
[11:04] and i said
[11:10] yes see i i have a system here that i
[11:13] use for
[11:14] scriptures i use ribbons uh numbered
[11:17] ribbons
[11:17] that push me to the scripture quickly
[11:20] matthew 16 and
[11:22] 1 through 4 and it says uh
[11:28] it says the pharisees also and the
[11:30] sadducees came
[11:32] and tempted tempting tempting desiring
[11:35] him
[11:36] that he would show them a sign
[11:39] from heaven and he answered and said
[11:42] unto them
[11:45] when it is evening ye say it will be
[11:48] fair
[11:49] weather for the sky is red and in the
[11:53] morning it it it will be
[11:56] foul weather today for the sky
[11:59] is red and lowering
[12:03] o ye hypocrites you can discern
[12:06] the face of the skies but ye cannot
[12:10] discern the the signs of the time
[12:14] a wicked and adulterous generation seeks
[12:16] after a sign
[12:18] therefore shall no sign be given him
[12:21] but the sign of the prophet jonas okay
[12:24] now we realize that red sky at morning
[12:26] and the way he explained it is that
[12:28] if it's a red sky in the morning there's
[12:30] going to be bad weather
[12:31] but there's going to be foul weather and
[12:33] he goes on to speak in luke about the
[12:35] same kind of thing
[12:37] but he refers to it a little different
[12:39] in in luke 12
[12:40] uh 2012 uh
[12:44] 54 and 56 uh
[12:47] so you see he's he's telling you that
[12:50] in in the scriptures here that as the
[12:53] the
[12:54] the weather can be the weather can
[12:57] at least in jerusalem the weather can be
[13:00] uh uh uh uh discerned amen
[13:04] let's go over to uh luke
[13:07] 12 54
[13:10] and 56 i mean uh yeah 54 and 56.
[13:15] it says let me go to 54.
[13:19] it says and he and he said also
[13:22] to the people when you see the clouds
[13:26] rise out of the west
[13:29] straightway ye say there cometh a shower
[13:33] and so it is and when you see when you
[13:36] see the south
[13:39] wind blow you say there shall be heat
[13:43] and and it cometh to pass you hypocrites
[13:47] you can discern the face of the skies
[13:50] and the air and of the earth but how
[13:54] but now is it that how is it that
[13:57] that ye do not discern the signs of the
[14:00] time
[14:01] now i want to talk a little bit about
[14:03] the signs of the time
[14:04] when we talk about the signs of the time
[14:07] we look
[14:08] and we know that a lot of things that
[14:10] the brother branham explained
[14:12] are coming to pass we know that the
[14:15] the the cars that drive themselves it's
[14:18] on the horizon
[14:19] already they they're testing like cars
[14:22] like the tesla
[14:23] the all-electric vehicles they have a uh
[14:26] even my new honda that i got
[14:28] has a steering set up that i can press a
[14:30] button and it'll keep me on the road
[14:32] but it keeps asking me to keep my hands
[14:34] on the steering yeah so i don't have to
[14:36] turn it i just have to hold it and it'll
[14:39] turn itself
[14:40] and it'll pretty well keeps to lane
[14:42] debbie doesn't like it
[14:45] that much but but you know uh uh if i'm
[14:48] getting sleepy
[14:49] no i better not but nevertheless
[14:52] nevertheless uh uh it's there
[14:55] they're putting it not just in electric
[14:57] vehicles they're putting it in gasoline
[14:59] vehicles
[15:00] and that's not all i noticed the other
[15:02] day when a car
[15:04] was pulling out ahead of me a light went
[15:06] on that said
[15:07] break break break break if i wouldn't
[15:11] have braked i
[15:12] think it would have break for me but i
[15:13] don't know i didn't read the manual
[15:16] but nevertheless uh uh
[15:20] it probably will break for me but uh
[15:23] and it probably would have shocked me
[15:24] pretty good
[15:26] but nevertheless the the
[15:29] the the signs of the time are coming to
[15:32] pass
[15:33] and you start to wonder where are we
[15:35] living at what what day are we living in
[15:37] what signs are there where is the lord
[15:40] leading us to
[15:41] what kind of things should we be looking
[15:42] for in our day and hour
[15:44] how should we be dedicating our lives
[15:48] wholeheartedly to the truth that's been
[15:50] presented to us
[15:51] how should we be living for jesus the
[15:54] way we should
[15:55] how should we be uh you know you could
[15:57] say turning off the television and
[15:59] and getting into your bible and praying
[16:01] and seeking god
[16:02] and looking for a better relationship
[16:04] with him because as the signs of the
[16:06] time are happening
[16:08] you start to see that hey jerusalem's in
[16:11] the middle of a battle out there
[16:13] and you don't know if they're going to
[16:14] be if they're already crying out to god
[16:17] if they're already saying we need a
[16:19] manifestation of your spirit
[16:22] and god says i'm going to turn my heart
[16:24] my i'm going to turn my view towards
[16:26] jerusalem one day and the prophet will
[16:29] show up over there and
[16:30] the gentile age will be over and the
[16:32] bride goes on the rapture
[16:34] the resurrection of the we we know the
[16:36] signs of the time
[16:38] we know the bible where we're living
[16:40] looking at the scriptures
[16:42] we're seeing through the message of the
[16:44] hour
[16:45] the clarity that where we're living at
[16:49] what kind of lives should we be living
[16:51] in this day and age
[16:53] and it and the so we start to see the
[16:55] signs of the time now
[16:57] we look at uh at uh
[17:00] at saint john 4 25 and 26
[17:04] and there there i'm just going to
[17:06] paraphrase it says
[17:08] yeah i know i know the the messiah
[17:11] cometh
[17:12] which i'll show us now you'll notice
[17:14] that
[17:15] uh this is the the story of the woman at
[17:17] the well right and you'll notice
[17:19] that the story of the woman well god was
[17:22] god somehow before he even came
[17:25] to the well himself well itself he
[17:28] already had
[17:29] showed this lady something so there's
[17:33] people
[17:34] out there that god will show something
[17:37] before they even get the chance to meet
[17:39] up with
[17:40] the fulfillment of it for example she
[17:43] says i know that the messiah cometh
[17:45] which
[17:46] which is called the christ he is
[17:50] which is called the christ he is which
[17:53] will
[17:54] okay lucy he's coming
[17:57] and will tell us all things so we're
[18:00] starting to see that
[18:01] even though we got a red sky in the
[18:03] morning
[18:04] judgment is hanging over us god can
[18:08] still
[18:08] show certain people what
[18:11] he wants to do with you so if we're
[18:15] going to apply that to ourselves
[18:16] for example in john 1 and
[18:19] 1 uh 40 and 40 and 51
[18:23] andrew and simon andrew and simon
[18:26] were well first andrew was with uh
[18:30] with john the baptist listen to john the
[18:31] baptist preached and john the baptist
[18:33] says
[18:34] a statement like behold the the son of
[18:36] god
[18:37] behold the lamb of god and andrew says
[18:40] wait
[18:41] i'm gonna andrew and somebody else said
[18:43] i'm gonna follow him
[18:46] there was something inside andrew that
[18:49] drew him
[18:50] to follow the messiah
[18:53] okay now as you see that and
[18:56] andrew and his friend decided to follow
[18:59] the messiah
[19:00] and the andrew decided hey i
[19:03] i realized that this is the messiah i'm
[19:06] going to go tell peter
[19:07] yeah so he goes and tells peter so
[19:10] there's
[19:11] there's a a a a scenery look opening up
[19:14] of how
[19:14] god can call a person out of where
[19:18] they're at
[19:20] remember they were jews in jerusalem
[19:24] following the the sanhedrin following
[19:26] the
[19:27] the high priest uh bringing their
[19:29] sacrifices doing
[19:30] all the things that that uh perf that
[19:33] day was do it was calling them to
[19:36] reading the books of moses the old
[19:38] testament but yet
[19:40] there was a message come forth through
[19:42] john the baptist
[19:44] that showed them that there was coming
[19:46] and they knew there was coming a messiah
[19:49] and brother branham paraphrases that or
[19:52] tells a little story how their dad
[19:56] their dad was explaining to them saying
[19:59] the messiah's coming
[20:01] and maybe i'm too old to be there for
[20:04] you guys well he's maybe
[20:05] fishing out there with simon that andrew
[20:07] he's fishing out there and he says
[20:09] but god has always provided for us but
[20:12] you know
[20:13] if if i go by way of the grave i just
[20:15] want to let you know
[20:16] watch out for him watch out for him
[20:20] the messiah is coming and he's going to
[20:22] be
[20:23] a person that knows the very secrets and
[20:26] intenses of the heart
[20:29] so here comes uh uh andrew until simon
[20:33] and simon goes down there to see him and
[20:36] jesus tells him
[20:37] you're the son of jonas he says well
[20:40] how did you know my dad how did you know
[20:44] my dad my dad was very faithful how did
[20:46] you know about him
[20:48] okay then you see that uh in the same
[20:51] town where andrew and simon
[20:53] lived was a was philip and i don't know
[20:56] if philip was the second person there
[20:58] but
[20:58] he comes over to nathan nathanael and
[21:01] tells him
[21:02] come and see the messiah come and see
[21:04] the man that i that we found
[21:06] we he's the i we think he's the messiah
[21:10] and nathanael says can anything good
[21:12] come out of nazareth
[21:14] so notice god was revealing to
[21:18] certain people calling certain people to
[21:21] follow a word for their day
[21:25] a word for their day so what is it even
[21:28] though the sky
[21:30] is red and luring judgment is hanging
[21:33] upon this day and age
[21:35] there's something that's going that
[21:37] calls
[21:38] the people of god to the their position
[21:42] in god amen amen so you know the story
[21:45] about nathanael and
[21:47] and how how how when nathaniel sees
[21:50] sees jesus jesus comes back and says
[21:53] says
[21:54] uh when you were under the fig tree i
[21:56] saw you that's right
[21:58] and nathaniel says i was praying under
[22:02] the fig tree you know
[22:03] brother branham's uh portrayal of it i
[22:05] was praying under the fig tree
[22:07] and he says you're the messiah you're
[22:08] the king of israel you're the
[22:10] you're the the you know he gave a
[22:13] testimony there
[22:14] and peter and jesus says because because
[22:17] i told you i saw you under the fig tree
[22:19] you say this
[22:20] you'll see greater things than this and
[22:23] he now you take a look
[22:25] you take a look on our calling this you
[22:28] know
[22:28] uh uh god shows people some things
[22:31] and i want to say that that each and
[22:34] every one of us
[22:35] have a testimony my testimony personally
[22:41] i was in the world and not wanting to
[22:43] serve god
[22:44] i was actually a couple of times i uh
[22:47] i simply said you know what
[22:50] you know devil if you'll give me money
[22:53] i'll sell my soul to you
[22:55] you know that's how bad i was and and
[22:58] and
[22:58] and i said uh and and why did he want to
[23:01] buy my soul he had it
[23:02] but but nevertheless uh i i was that way
[23:06] you know and i would wear these
[23:08] levi's jackets with a big serpent on the
[23:10] back and
[23:11] and at my young age teenage i would sit
[23:14] on top of the
[23:14] washing machine and and listen to all
[23:17] the grown-ups talk
[23:19] and very very catholic my family was and
[23:22] i'm sitting there with a big old serpent
[23:24] on the back of my jacket
[23:25] pretending to be mr tough guy yeah
[23:29] and one day on the same kitchen table
[23:32] right across from that washing machine
[23:34] i'm sitting there on top of the washing
[23:36] machine
[23:37] and my uncle comes in with the realtor
[23:39] reel recorder
[23:41] and he plays the sermon called deep
[23:43] colleth to the deep
[23:46] and i listen to the guy in there and
[23:47] then i kind of get off the washing
[23:49] machine and
[23:51] and i sit down on the on the bench that
[23:53] was on the side of the table and listen
[23:54] to that guy in there
[23:56] and he gets to the very end of the tape
[23:58] and i start seeing
[24:00] in the tape i'm listening to the healing
[24:02] service
[24:05] deep calling today preached in
[24:06] albuquerque and i says
[24:08] nobody can do that nobody can do that
[24:13] nobody knows those secrets nobody knows
[24:16] that he didn't know those people but yet
[24:17] he could tell them
[24:18] who they were what's wrong with them
[24:20] what the doctor said how they're going
[24:22] to re how they're going to recover
[24:26] i stayed listening to that then i then
[24:28] he my uncle brought over another tape
[24:31] and the other tape was uh was was
[24:34] serpent seed
[24:37] uh and and
[24:40] and so i listened to those two i think i
[24:42] listened to another one a world falling
[24:44] apart
[24:44] preached in albuquerque and
[24:48] i got up from there and walking around
[24:51] the the
[24:51] the barns and stuff i started crying out
[24:54] to god
[24:56] and i come back in and mom's mom's there
[24:59] uh cooking and stuff and i i tell her
[25:01] mom you know
[25:02] you you heard those things we heard last
[25:04] night on those tapes
[25:05] and she says yeah i said mom i said
[25:09] this is real we owe
[25:12] our lives to this we owe our lives to
[25:16] this
[25:17] and so so from there on in i mean
[25:21] uh uh well my mom suffered a lot because
[25:24] when she went and got baptized in
[25:28] in in the name of jesus christ by
[25:30] submersion
[25:31] uh that put a big old stir in the
[25:34] catholic church about her
[25:36] and so they started calling they her
[25:39] brothers and stuff were calling her up
[25:40] and calling her a horse
[25:42] being so stubborn because of what she's
[25:44] doing and how come she's leaving her
[25:46] faith and
[25:47] all these things and uh
[25:50] and i i you know she suffered a lot from
[25:53] her family because she left the
[25:55] left the catholic church but
[25:57] nevertheless
[25:58] she held to it and sure enough uh
[26:02] you know when we'd invite brothers to
[26:04] come up and have services up there
[26:06] my wife came to several of those
[26:07] services up there in in
[26:10] in rocia where we lived and uh as a
[26:13] little girl
[26:14] and what what happened was uh
[26:17] the family uh you know
[26:21] they come to me one day and says what
[26:24] are you doing
[26:25] why are you inviting all these people
[26:28] what are they coming to get a free
[26:29] vacation is what are they
[26:31] what's their idea what are they doing
[26:32] coming up here like that what
[26:34] what's what's the big deal which is
[26:38] we want to be around the people of god
[26:40] we want to
[26:41] we want to hear the things of god so
[26:44] so they said they said well you're all
[26:46] you're doing is just
[26:48] running yourself to the poor house how
[26:50] do you feed all these people and this
[26:52] i says it doesn't matter god will
[26:55] provide them we
[26:56] we need to we need to hear from god
[26:59] so that was the start of something
[27:02] pulling in my heart when when so we
[27:05] start
[27:06] to see that that that look at the wise
[27:08] men
[27:09] something told them to follow the star
[27:12] because the christ was there
[27:15] okay look at mary you know
[27:18] mary a a a young virgin maybe she read
[27:20] the scripture a virgin shall conceive
[27:22] she didn't know it was gonna be her but
[27:24] when the angel came and told her
[27:26] it's you she said be it unto me
[27:30] according to that word
[27:32] she was willing to accept what god was
[27:35] saying
[27:35] she her part was to play
[27:40] now we come and we start to look at our
[27:42] own lives and how we live
[27:44] what we're to what we're doing here in
[27:47] in
[27:48] lula and and in the in the in the
[27:50] message of this hour we start to look
[27:52] are we are we doing the very same kind
[27:55] of things
[27:56] right you know the bible
[27:59] the bible wants us to show who we are
[28:04] because he he because god reveals to us
[28:08] you know uh
[28:12] you know when when when when god was was
[28:16] was wanting to reveal himself see you
[28:19] realize
[28:21] we'll open up the waterway you know in
[28:24] the scripture we talk about
[28:26] we talk about uh about the the prophet
[28:29] telling
[28:30] them you know dig ditches so you can
[28:33] support all the water that's coming
[28:36] they're digging ditches in a dry desert
[28:38] yeah
[28:39] and he says dig ditches because you're
[28:41] gonna have to support all the water
[28:42] that's coming amen
[28:44] and now we so here we were
[28:47] and you realize that god's wanting to
[28:50] pour out a blessing
[28:52] so big that we can hardly contain it
[28:55] amen
[28:56] that's right and and we we start to look
[28:58] at
[29:00] the bible wants to show us and reveal to
[29:02] us
[29:03] himself and open his word to you so what
[29:06] are we doing
[29:08] you know
[29:11] excuse me my throat lasts for a little
[29:14] bit but then it starts to give up
[29:16] amen but uh brother dale had cough drops
[29:19] in there about a few hours
[29:20] amen so what happens then we start to
[29:23] look and we see that
[29:24] that the word of god wanting to reveal
[29:27] itself
[29:28] you say uh you know when we start to ask
[29:32] you know you know you start to ask
[29:35] questions
[29:38] we know in in let's let's go over to uh
[29:41] matthew 16 13.
[29:45] and this is uh of course i got uh
[29:49] this this little story was on three of
[29:51] the gospels in mark
[29:53] 8 and in luke
[29:57] 9 and 18 it was all those three places
[30:00] it's
[30:00] talked about but in matthew 16 16
[30:06] the 13th chapter jesus says
[30:09] whom do men say that i the son of man
[30:12] am. and the disciples answered and said
[30:16] well some say you're
[30:19] some say you're john the baptist some
[30:21] say you're elijah
[30:22] some say or one of the other prophets
[30:27] so and you know if you continue on
[30:31] and you read your scriptures you'll
[30:32] start to see that the pharisees say
[30:34] you're beelzebub
[30:36] the sadducees say you're a devil
[30:40] this the uh in in saint john 2 and 15
[30:44] uh the uh the sanhedrin
[30:48] in the temple and the temple guards saw
[30:51] you
[30:52] uh make a whip of cords and whip out all
[30:54] those people they say you're a terrorist
[30:56] because you uh you you you want to just
[31:00] uh mess up the the system that we have
[31:03] you know they say you're you're you're
[31:06] you're you're just want to change things
[31:08] you know uh they said they called him
[31:11] angry or mad
[31:12] doing that you say okay the
[31:16] the the you could say dr james dobson
[31:20] focus on the family uh they're all
[31:23] saying well you're a family destroyer
[31:25] you don't want to
[31:26] build up the family you want to tear it
[31:28] down the temple
[31:29] of the the dr james dobson in in in in
[31:33] in on the radio or on the web
[31:36] uh they're saying that jesus was trying
[31:38] a family destroyer because in matthew 10
[31:41] yeah uh matthew 10 34 and to
[31:44] 38 let's go over there and read it
[31:48] real quick because
[31:52] matthew
[31:57] it says i didn't come to bring a
[32:02] what's it where is it
[32:12] think
[32:16] i guess i didn't mark that right
[32:22] 10 34 to 38
[32:26] okay
[32:54] earth peace but a sword okay that's it
[32:58] that's matthew what 10 34. yeah
[33:01] all right got it matthew 10 34.
[33:12] okay think ye think not that i am come
[33:16] to send peace on the earth i come not to
[33:19] send
[33:20] peace but a sword for i am come to set
[33:24] man
[33:24] in v in vengeance and vengeance
[33:28] in variance against
[33:31] the father and the and the daughter
[33:36] against her mother and the
[33:40] daughter in in law against the
[33:44] uh against her mother
[33:48] in against her mother-in-law and a man's
[33:51] foes shall be they of his own household
[33:55] amen so you start to see that god if
[33:59] if family life radio or or or or
[34:02] they say focus on the family god's
[34:04] saying
[34:05] really what he's saying is if you love
[34:07] your father or mother
[34:09] more than me you're not worthy of me
[34:13] amen so jesus you say well is jesus
[34:16] trying to
[34:17] raise himself up well of course he's
[34:19] trying to raise himself up because
[34:21] his word is eternal amen
[34:25] amen so in short not everybody spoke
[34:28] good of jesus but you start to see that
[34:32] hey this message is becoming such a
[34:35] a controversial thing where they'll take
[34:38] what the net says they'll take what the
[34:40] radio says
[34:41] they'll take what they're what they're
[34:42] putting out wherever
[34:44] somebody can build a platform to speak
[34:47] but they'll take that to say that hey
[34:50] it's not real right but you know not
[34:53] everybody spoke good of jesus
[34:55] and when you talk about the message of
[34:57] sour or brother branham directly
[34:59] when you talk about brother branham you
[35:01] start to see that not everybody says
[35:03] good things about him
[35:04] some people call him a fortune teller a
[35:06] medium a wizard
[35:08] a hypnotist he was grabbing for money
[35:12] that's not true we can tell that he was
[35:15] uh
[35:15] looking to make himself somebody great
[35:18] or or
[35:18] popular of course they can't say that he
[35:22] was after women
[35:23] but you could start seeing that look
[35:26] they they
[35:26] they call him a false prophet that's
[35:28] going to raise up at the end
[35:30] time an antichrist one of the
[35:31] antichrists of the last days
[35:34] what is going on where where are they
[35:36] getting all this from
[35:37] some say that they some say that he he
[35:40] started
[35:41] uh uh he started
[35:44] as a prophet a good prophet of god but
[35:46] he went astray
[35:47] at the end god uh put him in an accident
[35:50] and took him off the scene
[35:52] some people say that but what happens
[35:55] some people say that but some people say
[35:57] other things
[35:58] too t.l osborne said he was uh
[36:01] that he saw he saw christ in the man
[36:05] christ in the flesh so you say you you
[36:08] say well
[36:08] and and others say well he was he was
[36:11] jesus christ
[36:12] resurrected so there's a balance you
[36:15] can't just
[36:16] go from one extreme to another other
[36:19] some people call them false some people
[36:21] call him real
[36:22] some people call jesus false some people
[36:24] call jesus real
[36:25] but we stand to live for what
[36:29] he represents in our lives
[36:32] we stand to hold for what he's moving in
[36:35] our lives
[36:35] how he's revealing himself to you and
[36:38] through you
[36:39] amen so you see what happens we we
[36:42] realize that in the days that we live in
[36:45] that we're coming to the place that
[36:48] you know that the judgment is hanging
[36:51] over this nation
[36:52] judgment's hanging over the world and if
[36:55] we don't have
[36:56] our place in this ministry if we don't
[36:59] have
[36:59] our we don't take our place in the
[37:01] five-fold we don't take our place
[37:03] as believers of this truth if we don't
[37:06] look at
[37:07] what god's doing in your day and your
[37:09] age to bring you to a rapturing faith
[37:12] we realize the rapture is right at hand
[37:16] and if you don't stand to live for god
[37:19] in the ways that's called heresy
[37:24] paul called it heresy paul called it he
[37:26] said in the way that's called heresy
[37:28] that's the way i live for jesus christ
[37:31] that's the way
[37:32] i i produce this word if you look at
[37:36] paul
[37:37] they called him mad you're mad your
[37:39] wisdom has made you mad
[37:41] amen and you say well yeah it does look
[37:43] like i'm mad but you know what
[37:46] i i want everybody to serve god
[37:49] except for these chains see he was
[37:52] recognizing
[37:53] his day and his hour and what he was to
[37:55] live for
[37:56] he couldn't go back to the sanhedrin he
[37:59] couldn't go back to them and say
[38:01] look i'll follow your ways
[38:05] i'll persecute the christians he
[38:08] couldn't go back why
[38:09] because the vision that he had
[38:13] of jesus christ was enough to show him
[38:17] that i can go back to the scripture and
[38:20] see
[38:20] that in jesus was the fulfillment of
[38:23] all the word that was hidden through the
[38:26] ages
[38:28] so what happens if you stand here and
[38:31] you
[38:31] start to look at the things that are
[38:33] said about the message of this hour
[38:36] about the things that god has done in
[38:38] our day and age
[38:39] and you stand back and you start to
[38:41] claim hey
[38:42] this really wasn't uh what they claim it
[38:46] is
[38:47] and you start to say look i have never
[38:50] seen anything like this
[38:52] you know when they were when they were
[38:54] persecuting jesus
[38:56] and they the the soldiers the soldiers
[38:59] came up
[39:00] to to to uh they they were
[39:03] going to arrest the the the lord and and
[39:06] the
[39:06] in the the sanhedrin or the the scribes
[39:09] and pharisees said to the soldiers
[39:11] how come you don't arrest this man
[39:15] they said never a man spoke like this
[39:17] man
[39:18] never a man spoke like this man i you
[39:21] know
[39:22] he said are you crazy too do you see the
[39:24] priest following him right
[39:28] and you know what when they tell me you
[39:31] know that
[39:32] uh brother branham is false all i can
[39:35] say is
[39:36] i listen to the tapes never a man spoke
[39:39] like this man i can't
[39:41] see i can only see jesus christ in that
[39:44] man
[39:45] that's all i can see and what happens
[39:48] what happens
[39:49] we stand to live for a gospel
[39:52] that's been publicly portrayed before us
[39:57] you know you say well i stand here and i
[40:00] realize
[40:00] that the the god that was in paul
[40:04] the god that was manifesting himself
[40:07] through peter
[40:08] is the same god that was doing the works
[40:11] through brother branham
[40:12] and the same god that will do his work
[40:14] through the five-fold ministry
[40:15] in our message right now if you still
[40:19] if you you know if if ever you think
[40:22] that you
[40:23] you can't reach out and touch god
[40:26] because you're in a place where god has
[40:29] manifested himself
[40:31] time and time again you stand to say
[40:33] well look
[40:34] what good is it all amen what do i have
[40:37] if i don't have this
[40:38] right if this word is false i stand to
[40:42] lose
[40:42] everything
[40:46] you know i i i i mean my soul especially
[40:50] where do i stand you can only stand on
[40:53] what's truth
[40:54] the scripture proves itself yes right
[40:57] but then we go back let me talk a little
[40:59] bit about
[41:00] about what i've seen through this
[41:03] okay i'm talking about red sky in the
[41:06] morning still
[41:07] judgment you know there has to be a
[41:09] falling away
[41:10] there has to be people that fulfill the
[41:13] word of the great
[41:14] falling away there's going to be people
[41:16] that are going to take the way
[41:17] and say oh brother branham was a false
[41:19] prophet
[41:21] yeah so they called jesus a false
[41:22] prophet they called paul the false
[41:24] prophet
[41:25] they called all the christians a false
[41:27] false false
[41:28] they called they if they call our lord
[41:31] how much more that
[41:32] will they call his people amen so they
[41:35] they may call they'll call brother
[41:36] brother dale that he's a
[41:38] a false minister following a false
[41:40] message but you start to look at the
[41:42] word of god that's been manifest for our
[41:44] day
[41:45] and you can't say that we can't say that
[41:48] we the believer can't say that
[41:50] why because we're believers amen amen
[41:54] so so we stand here we look at that the
[41:57] rapture's
[41:58] at hand you know the scriptures of the
[42:01] rapture you
[42:02] you read the scriptures of the rapture
[42:04] and you start to look at the scriptures
[42:06] the rapture the rapture says
[42:07] and the rapture says that the the shout
[42:11] is and brother brown said the shout is a
[42:13] message going forth
[42:15] right so if you start to look at it
[42:18] the shout happened already
[42:21] so the rapture's it's on its way
[42:25] the rapture started already okay
[42:29] and it's just coming to a place where as
[42:31] the revelation
[42:33] that god is revealing for our day
[42:36] to bring us to the right place in the
[42:38] right position
[42:39] will manifest itself in the changing of
[42:43] our bodies
[42:44] amen changing of our bodies there
[42:47] are youth come you know what happened to
[42:49] paul i mean to uh
[42:50] to uh uh abraham and sarah what happened
[42:54] to abraham and sarah they became young
[42:56] again
[42:57] how come they became young again because
[42:59] the manifested promised word
[43:01] finally came to pass they became young
[43:05] again
[43:05] received the promised son hallelujah
[43:08] sarah died right away
[43:10] but that doesn't matter that doesn't
[43:13] matter because we realize
[43:14] that the truth of the word of god still
[43:17] came to pass
[43:18] amen so we still look at malachi 4 and
[43:22] 1.
[43:22] and we look at the judgment hanging over
[43:26] the world the nation the peoples
[43:30] and we and that they'll burn up and be
[43:32] like an oven
[43:33] and we still see that the word of god
[43:36] has
[43:36] promised to abride a changing of a body
[43:41] amen the changing of the body and the
[43:44] and the rapture of the church amen paul
[43:47] won't see paul again
[43:49] we'll see peter again we'll see all the
[43:51] saints of old
[43:52] coming to life again and we'll be going
[43:55] up with them
[43:55] amen in a rapture amen so we'll
[43:58] we we recognize that as we take hold of
[44:02] what god's doing in our day and age
[44:04] it's going to make up change it makes a
[44:07] change first of all
[44:08] in us mentally spiritually we don't do
[44:12] the things we used to do
[44:14] but most of all it brings us to a
[44:17] revelation
[44:18] that god is doing a work for you
[44:22] today amen god is yeah god has
[44:25] has had secrets through the ages amen
[44:29] you know if i was looking at some of the
[44:30] secrets you know uh
[44:32] daniel uh daniel 12 12 and 12-9 it says
[44:35] that
[44:36] the the the the lord said close up the
[44:40] vision
[44:40] and its prophecies in in revelations 10
[44:43] he was john was told hold these things
[44:46] that the seven thunders uttered
[44:48] and write them not for therefore the
[44:50] time of the end
[44:51] so we're starting to look at hey the
[44:53] things that been
[44:54] hid through the ages the messenger of
[44:58] the hour will
[44:59] will bring a truth there that will
[45:02] open your understanding to scriptures
[45:05] hidden through the ages
[45:07] and the people are saying well we want
[45:09] to go back to the bible
[45:11] we want to go back to the bible if
[45:13] they're going to go back to the bible
[45:14] without the revelation of what god's
[45:16] revealed in this day and age
[45:18] they're going to go back to what the
[45:19] baptists have a dead letter amen
[45:21] amen the catholics had a dead letter
[45:25] and and then go start making a lot of
[45:27] doctrines out of it
[45:29] but they don't have the truth of what
[45:31] god's doing in there
[45:33] where god's revealing and bringing these
[45:35] things you know bringing a clearness of
[45:37] it i dropped the paper here
[45:39] bringing a a clearness of of what god's
[45:42] doing in the day and age
[45:44] and not only that it wasn't just that he
[45:47] was
[45:48] clearly clarifying all these things it
[45:50] was
[45:51] vindicated showing you that this
[45:54] is truth because the signs and wonders
[45:58] that came behind it
[46:00] amen what kind of signs and wonders are
[46:02] you talking about
[46:04] okay restoration of several things
[46:08] you know malachi 4 5 and 6 tells us that
[46:11] there's going to be
[46:12] a return to pentecost that's what i'm
[46:14] saying
[46:15] it's a return to god manifesting himself
[46:18] in his people again that's what the the
[46:22] pentecost really that's what malachi
[46:24] uh was to malachi 4 and 5 messenger
[46:27] what's to do
[46:28] now what are we looking at okay
[46:31] what have we had in this 20th century
[46:35] return of visions you know brother
[46:38] we were through the denominations we we
[46:41] were back there
[46:42] for years there was nobody having
[46:44] visions
[46:46] okay supernatural voices speaking to you
[46:50] nobody was getting that there was no
[46:52] supernatural voices
[46:54] oh we read their bibles yeah we heard
[46:56] things we didn't hear
[46:57] hear supernatural voices uh coming from
[47:00] would
[47:01] avoid an angel visitation would you ever
[47:03] hear of all the angels visiting you
[47:06] no angels visiting explaining to you the
[47:08] scriptures
[47:09] telling you about your peculiar it was
[47:12] telling brother brown about his peculiar
[47:13] life
[47:14] how it was go because there was a work
[47:17] for him to do when he got older
[47:19] okay appearances of the pillar of fire
[47:22] there was nothing like that
[47:24] we didn't have no pillar of fire in the
[47:25] catholic church we didn't have no
[47:27] no no healing of the sick not even
[47:30] cancer would stand before the prayer
[47:32] we didn't have none of that i mean we
[47:35] just died
[47:35] that was it and the catholic church
[47:37] didn't give you any promises
[47:39] they said all you have to do is die
[47:42] you know you just gotta stay in the
[47:44] faith and die yeah
[47:46] so but there was no no uh no hopes of of
[47:50] of
[47:51] of of a miracle amen uh
[47:54] the raising of the dead we never heard
[47:57] of anything like that
[47:58] uh revealing of the bible mystery
[48:01] secrets that have been hid through the
[48:02] ages
[48:03] nobody looked for those things okay
[48:07] what happened uh discerning of spirits
[48:09] there was nobody could do that
[48:11] there was nobody could could produce
[48:12] those things the ability to show
[48:15] uh show jesus christ presence amongst us
[48:19] to bring jesus christ
[48:21] out of history and show him publicly
[48:25] right in front of you manifesting
[48:28] himself right in front of you
[48:30] praying for i mean healing you people
[48:33] right out in front of you
[48:34] nobody could bring jesus out of out of
[48:36] history like that
[48:38] the voice of god coming out of heaven
[48:41] all those things
[48:42] what is it we're looking at a day in age
[48:44] when these things have become manifested
[48:47] these things have been shown these
[48:49] things have proven itself
[48:51] for real in our day and age
[48:54] a powerful mystery not even i mean
[48:58] you you you you read about it in the
[49:00] book of acts but you're seeing it in our
[49:03] day
[49:04] so what are we looking for then we're
[49:07] looking for a reality a real god
[49:10] that's doing the very same thing you
[49:12] know the the
[49:13] the the things have been uh chopped off
[49:16] the nicean council cut off water baptism
[49:19] they cut off the
[49:20] the true name of or should i say gave
[49:23] the father son the holy ghost
[49:24] uh titles and took away the the one true
[49:27] god
[49:28] and you start to look at all the things
[49:30] that have been cut off through the ages
[49:32] those all those truths had to come
[49:35] and be manifested in our day and age to
[49:38] bring us to a reality of a living god
[49:41] living amongst us manifesting yourself
[49:45] through your brethren through the people
[49:48] that you
[49:49] fellowship with manifesting itself
[49:53] now look things had been hidden through
[49:54] the ages
[49:56] like you know who who did foot washing
[49:59] in the denominations
[50:00] that was all gone who did who did who
[50:03] used the lemon bread
[50:05] uh cooked by the sisters or or something
[50:08] like that no we got salty crackers
[50:10] uh we bought them at the store uh grape
[50:13] juice we used to use grape juice
[50:14] because prohibition says we shouldn't be
[50:16] drinking alcohol yeah
[50:18] we're using grape juice for communion uh
[50:21] where uh what what happened to the to
[50:24] the uh
[50:26] what happened what happened to the
[50:30] the truth about marriage and divorce the
[50:32] truth about the positions in the
[50:34] household
[50:35] those things were all thrown nobody had
[50:37] any understanding of
[50:39] where the husband's place is where a
[50:42] wife's place is
[50:43] where the children's place is who speaks
[50:45] to the children
[50:46] who speaks to the husband and how the
[50:49] how the
[50:50] the that jesus is over the husband okay
[50:53] they didn't there was no place in
[50:54] positioning in the household
[50:56] no fivefold ministry and where their
[50:58] position is
[51:02] it was all uh ahead headaches or
[51:05] hierarchies or
[51:06] or are part of the denomination uh
[51:09] elders and and
[51:10] bishop district district prisoners and
[51:13] stuff like that going all the way up the
[51:15] ladder but you never really got to where
[51:19] you knew that you're doing a work of god
[51:22] in your life amen amen we start to look
[51:27] as we get ready to close it i i realize
[51:31] that you know the scriptures hebrews 11
[51:35] the fathers of the faith we realize
[51:39] hebrews 12 1 and 2 it says
[51:43] let me go over there real quick
[51:46] i think brother i'll put it up real
[51:48] quick as we close
[51:51] we stand to our feet the musicians can
[51:54] go ahead and come up
[51:56] let me go over to hebrews 12. i did not
[51:59] mark this one so bear with me
[52:05] hebrews 12. as i call brother
[52:09] dale back to the pulpit
[52:18] wherefore seeing that we also
[52:22] are compassed about with so great a
[52:26] cloud of witnesses
[52:28] let us lay aside every weight and the
[52:31] sin
[52:32] which doth easily beset us and let us
[52:35] run with patience the race that is set
[52:38] before us
[52:40] looking unto jesus the author and
[52:43] finisher
[52:44] of our faith that's right so as we look
[52:46] at all those saints that have gone on
[52:49] and all of us who are coming on we
[52:52] realize
[52:54] that of course hebrews the uh
[52:58] 11th chapter and
[53:01] to me it's the 40th birth god having
[53:04] provided
[53:05] some better things for us
[53:08] that they without us should not be made
[53:11] perfect
[53:13] god's looking for us to take
[53:16] our position in the fathers of faith
[53:19] amen amen
[53:21] let's pray thank you our dear and
[53:24] precious lord
[53:26] lord god as uh i've taken the scripture
[53:28] lord god and

[53:32] god and trying to bring
[53:34] a reality to a people or god of a day
[53:37] and age lord jesus when
[53:39] all things lord god are are they're
[53:41] trying to bring them into question
[53:44] but lord jesus we can't question your
[53:46] word lord god
[53:47] we can't question your divine
[53:49] inspiration that has been brought to us

[55:25] chapter 6 verse 66
[55:28] and what it says is
[55:31] let me go there real quick saint john
[55:36] 6 and verse 66
[55:40] and this is a proclamation that i
[55:42] thought was interesting it says
[55:44] from from that time many
[55:47] of his disciples went back
[55:50] amen and walked no more with him
[55:55] so you see this was right when jesus
[55:58] preached that sermon and said
[55:59] said you eat my flesh and drink my blood
[56:03] 666 tells you that they the
[56:06] the the the disciples that were
[56:09] following jesus
[56:10] the 70 the the the multitudes that were
[56:13] following
[56:14] went no more with him
[56:17] backing away from god knowing what god
[56:21] has done
[56:21] and knowing what where knowing the the
[56:24] word of the lord
[56:25] and then walking away from it it
[56:28] truly is the mark of the beast
[56:31] but peter's confession is this jesus
[56:35] and simon peter answered him lord
[56:39] to whom will we go amen thou hast the
[56:42] words of eternal life
