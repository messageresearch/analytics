[0:00] seated
[0:06] god bless you saints good to be back in
[0:07] the house of the lord
[0:12] all right we're continuing on with our
[0:13] little sunday school lesson in the book
[0:15] of hebrews and uh if the brothers could
[0:17] go ahead and pull that powerpoint up for
[0:19] the
[0:20] next few minutes and uh
[0:23] just kind of summarize where we left off
[0:25] it's been been a while so you might not
[0:27] remember
[0:29] and uh
[0:30] so um this this first slide is just kind
[0:33] of a review of where we left off in
[0:34] hebrews one just kind of summarizing so
[0:37] the the the main topic of chapter one in
[0:40] hebrews is
[0:42] is god has he's revealed himself in a
[0:43] lot of different ways in the in the past
[0:46] and through the old testament and at the
[0:48] culmination of the old testament
[0:50] and then jesus christ the one that was
[0:53] speaking to the prophets comes upon the
[0:54] scene himself the one that had been
[0:57] foretold
[0:58] and and he's kind of the uh the
[1:00] fulfillment of the all of the old
[1:02] testament uh being manifested there at
[1:04] the end
[1:05] and so paul is setting forth that christ
[1:07] christ's greatness that he's the heir of
[1:09] all things he's the one who's both the
[1:11] creator and heir and he's also a perfect
[1:14] reflection of god if you want to know
[1:16] what god is look at that man because
[1:18] he's the the express image of his person
[1:22] his and his word is so powerful that all
[1:24] he's made is sustained by that word
[1:26] everything that you can see every the
[1:27] world the the the the moon circling the
[1:30] planet earth the sun everything the way
[1:32] that everything is situated that the the
[1:35] grass growing in the in the in your yard
[1:37] every everything that you can see is
[1:39] uphill by his word
[1:41] and it's this person who's provided pure
[1:43] if you keep reading through hebrews just
[1:45] to kind of summarize where paul's going
[1:46] he's this this person who has provided
[1:49] purification for sins and taken his seat
[1:51] at the right hand of majesty in heaven
[1:53] and that
[1:54] paul's going to get into that more in
[1:55] chapter 8 and 10 and 12.
[1:58] but he's got a position jesus christ and
[2:01] he has a position and eminence far
[2:02] beyond anything that the angels can
[2:04] claim so paul's setting the setting the
[2:07] stage for us to understand the deity and
[2:09] the magnificence and who this man is
[2:11] that that came so that the hebrews could
[2:13] have understanding that this is not just
[2:15] another preacher or a good prophet or
[2:17] something but this is actually god
[2:18] manifest in the flesh
[2:20] so if we kind of read the actual if we
[2:22] go to the next slide and just kind of
[2:24] read what paul actually said just real
[2:26] quick before we get into the lesson here
[2:29] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[2:31] manners spake in time past unto the
[2:33] fathers by the prophets
[2:35] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[2:37] by his son
[2:39] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[2:41] things by whom also he made the worlds
[2:43] who being the brightness of his glory
[2:45] and the express image of his person
[2:48] upholding all things by the word of his
[2:50] power when he had by himself purged our
[2:53] sins
[2:54] sat down on the right hand of the
[2:56] majesty on high
[2:57] and that's uh
[2:59] it it just it just almost boggles my
[3:02] mind how every one of these things every
[3:03] one of these sentences that paul said is
[3:05] just laden down with so many rich things
[3:10] that we want to unpack and one one of
[3:12] the things that sat down on the right
[3:13] hand of the majesty on high so maybe
[3:15] we'll get into that a little bit this
[3:17] this morning as as paul kind of at the
[3:19] end of hebrews chapter one he gets into
[3:21] that thought again sit sat down
[3:25] so we'll look at that a little bit later
[3:27] being made so much better than the
[3:28] angels as he hath by inheritance
[3:30] obtained a more excellent name than they
[3:32] and what what more excellent name could
[3:34] that he have obtained and he he was
[3:36] actually god in the flesh he was he was
[3:38] he was god manifested
[3:41] for unto which of the angels said he at
[3:43] any time thou art my son this day have i
[3:45] begotten thee
[3:46] and again i will be to him a father and
[3:48] he shall be to me a son
[3:50] and again when he bringeth in the first
[3:52] begotten in the world he saith and let
[3:54] all the angels of god worship him again
[3:56] so paul setting up setting the stage
[3:58] that
[3:59] that this is this is actually god
[4:01] manifest in the flesh and of the angels
[4:03] he saith who make it his angels spirits
[4:06] and his ministers a flame of fire
[4:09] so let's dwell on that last scripture
[4:11] and in the previous lessons if you
[4:13] remember we kind of laid out the case
[4:15] that paul when he speaks of angels
[4:18] he's actually begins
[4:20] we brought the thought down to down
[4:22] actually to the earth where the angels
[4:24] that he's speaking of actually the
[4:26] ministers to bring the gospel to share
[4:28] to bring the word to you and so he's
[4:30] saying here who maketh his angels
[4:32] spirits and his ministers a flame of
[4:34] fire
[4:36] and we talked about how the ministers
[4:37] are actually anointed by a supernatural
[4:40] by anointed by deity minister spirits
[4:43] they're ministering spirits to bring the
[4:45] word so they're anointed by by
[4:48] they're bringing a thought that it's not
[4:49] something that they thought of it's
[4:51] actually something that they're bringing
[4:52] a thought that god is giving them a a
[4:56] supernatural idea
[4:58] who maketh his angels spirits and his
[5:00] ministers a flame of fire
[5:02] now
[5:04] to kind of to kind of take that thought
[5:05] you have to kind of you know
[5:08] think about how when when moses as he
[5:10] was in the wilderness uh
[5:13] you know he when he when he met that
[5:14] that burning bush he it it was it kind
[5:17] of set his life on fire and he began to
[5:19] he began to have have something to say
[5:22] and and you know the psalms 104 says who
[5:25] maketh his angels
[5:26] a lot of times paul when he's when he's
[5:28] when he's uh writing in the book of
[5:30] hebrews he's actually quoting the old
[5:32] testament prophets and you can see that
[5:33] in psalm 104
[5:35] uh probably 50 of the things he says in
[5:38] hebrews are actually quoting from from
[5:40] the old testament he's just repeating
[5:42] verbatim almost what what they said
[5:44] so
[5:46] moses when he when he got a revelation
[5:48] of of what the word was he began he
[5:51] began he was able to begin to relate
[5:53] that to people and it's like a burning
[5:55] fire and jeremiah kind of speaks to that
[5:57] in jeremiah chapter 20 where it says
[5:59] then i said i will not make mention of
[6:01] him nor speak anymore in his name but
[6:03] his word was in mine heart as a burning
[6:06] fire
[6:07] shut up in my bones and i was weary with
[6:10] forbearing and i could not stay in other
[6:12] words he had he had a message in his
[6:15] heart and he had he had he was compelled
[6:18] to deliver it you know a lot of times
[6:20] you hear you hear uh people say a young
[6:22] man or whatever they begin to feel like
[6:24] maybe god is placing a calling in their
[6:26] life and they begin to wonder if if
[6:28] they're called to preach if they're
[6:29] called to minister and i maybe just kind
[6:31] of echo these words here if if you've
[6:33] got it
[6:34] like like moses and like jeremiah if
[6:37] you've got a revelation in your heart
[6:39] and it's burning and you've got to share
[6:42] it then that that's that's really
[6:45] maybe god's working doing something in
[6:47] your life but first before you can
[6:49] preach before you can preach you got to
[6:50] have something to preach
[6:52] and i believe any man that's called to
[6:54] preach is preaching not not for
[6:56] fame or
[6:57] popularity or anything like that but
[6:59] because he's got a revelation that he
[7:01] wants to share that can help somebody
[7:03] that
[7:04] when god reveals something to you
[7:06] it it's it's to give out it's to help
[7:09] other people so that's that's really
[7:10] what i minister a minister a flame of
[7:12] fire because there's there's a message
[7:14] in his heart that's burning within him
[7:18] burning burning to give out and you know
[7:20] you know a lot of times you think um you
[7:22] know ministers gotta gotta hop hop
[7:24] around and run up down the aisles and
[7:26] and that's really what the flame of fire
[7:28] is but the flame of fire is actually
[7:29] that there's a message in you
[7:31] to give out to people and you may be
[7:34] able to maybe deliver it calmly and just
[7:36] plainly
[7:37] i think it's almost more important to be
[7:39] able to to to deliver in a way that
[7:42] people can understand and grasp it then
[7:45] maybe to just get so uh hyped up
[7:47] sometimes if we
[7:49] the main thing is that the word is the
[7:51] thing that will deliver us the word is
[7:53] the thing that gives us power and that's
[7:55] why it says his word was in my heart as
[7:57] a burning fire shut up in my bones and i
[8:00] was weary with for barry and what did
[8:02] job say in
[8:03] in chapter 32 for i am full of matter
[8:06] the spirit within me constraineth me
[8:09] in other words he's got something to say
[8:11] he knows something about god and when
[8:14] you have a revelation from god that can
[8:16] help somebody you want to give it out
[8:19] in psalm 39 my heart was within me
[8:21] my heart was was hot within me while i
[8:24] was amusing the fire burned
[8:26] then spake eye with my tongue and all
[8:28] these places in the scripture it's
[8:29] talking about it's talking about the
[8:31] word that's down in your heart is
[8:33] actually burning so much you got you've
[8:36] got to share it
[8:38] if you've ever you ever had a
[8:40] conversation with somebody and you you
[8:41] can almost see that they're they're
[8:43] they're kind of like in a prison
[8:45] and and that word just goes to burning
[8:47] if you could if you could get them out
[8:48] of their predicament so you want to
[8:50] share something with them
[8:52] in acts chapter 4 says we cannot for we
[8:55] cannot but speak we can't help but speak
[8:57] the things which we have seen and heard
[8:59] we've if you if you've got it all
[9:01] bottled up in you you've got to share it
[9:04] if you've got a revelation of the
[9:05] message of the hour then you've you've
[9:07] got to give it to somebody
[9:11] let's go to let's go to the next the
[9:13] next verse we're just kind of unpacking
[9:15] these scriptures one at a time
[9:17] this morning but under the sun he saith
[9:19] thy throne of god as forever and ever a
[9:22] scepter of righteousness as the scepter
[9:24] of thy kingdom and again he's quoting
[9:26] he's quoting from david that said in
[9:28] chapter 45 of psalms thy throne o god is
[9:31] forever and ever the scepter of thy
[9:33] kingdom is a right scepter
[9:35] thou lovest righteousness and hated
[9:37] wickedness therefore god thy god hath
[9:40] anointed thee
[9:42] with the oil of gladness above thy
[9:44] fellows and if we'll go to the next
[9:46] slide
[9:47] a a a scepter is is is a sign of of
[9:51] authority or sovereignty and and you
[9:53] know a lot of a lot of scholars or
[9:54] whatever will write that down and
[9:56] there's like a long scepter a scepter is
[9:58] what you hold up that has you wears held
[10:00] up to to show that he was had authority
[10:02] when esther came into the into the
[10:04] throne room and there uh so scholars
[10:07] will break that down and there'd be a
[10:09] long staff that that symbolizes royal
[10:12] authority and a short staff that
[10:13] symbolizes royal military power but what
[10:16] what is what is christ's scepter the
[10:19] thing that shows his his power and his
[10:21] authority
[10:22] it's actually his righteousness and
[10:24] that's what he's saying is
[10:26] his
[10:27] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[10:29] of thy kingdom
[10:30] and the new living translations
[10:32] translation says you rule with a scepter
[10:34] of justice
[10:36] and the nirv says your kingdom will be
[10:38] ruled by what is right
[10:41] so you think about that that god is god
[10:43] is uh everything about god is what is
[10:45] right and so if you want to be right
[10:47] then get into god if you want to be
[10:49] correct then get into his word because
[10:52] that's the only way that you can find
[10:53] out what is right and true
[10:56] and if we go to the next the next
[10:57] scripture in hebrews 1 9 it says thou
[11:01] has loved righteousness
[11:03] and hated iniquity therefore god even
[11:06] thy god hath anointed thee with all of
[11:08] gladness above thy fellas
[11:10] now the the
[11:12] uh
[11:13] the the definition for that word
[11:16] righteousness in the in the hebrew
[11:17] lexicon is
[11:19] it refers to the quality of being
[11:20] righteous
[11:22] or in the right
[11:23] and or or just or justness and justice
[11:28] and brother brown said he made these
[11:29] comments about righteousness he said
[11:31] satan's eden
[11:33] is established in sin because satan is
[11:35] sin
[11:36] god is righteousness
[11:38] and god's kingdom was established in
[11:41] righteousness
[11:42] and peace and life
[11:44] and satan's establishment is in sin and
[11:47] religious sin
[11:49] and he said again the beginning of
[11:51] righteousness
[11:52] is god's revealed truth
[11:55] and the entire church of the living god
[11:57] is built upon that
[11:59] so if we want to know what righteousness
[12:01] is
[12:01] we can open up our bible and we begin to
[12:03] read and out of the pages of god's
[12:05] living word comes comes what right
[12:08] righteousness is and he said
[12:10] righteousness is the attribute of
[12:11] salvation
[12:13] and he said again it's up to us to see
[12:15] that all god's righteousness is
[12:17] fulfilled
[12:19] and what is his righteousness his word
[12:22] so now we're kind of just opposing we're
[12:24] juxtaposing these two thoughts
[12:26] righteousness
[12:27] and iniquity and we're holding these two
[12:29] thoughts up side by side
[12:31] so righteousness is god's word if you
[12:33] want to know what anything right is then
[12:35] you look into god's word and god's word
[12:37] will tell you how to live right and how
[12:38] to do right now to dress right it'll
[12:40] clothe you right it'll make you walk
[12:42] right it'll make you it'll make you come
[12:44] to church and sit in the congregation of
[12:45] the lord it'll line you up so that
[12:47] you're doing right and then so
[12:49] everything that's right is is in god's
[12:52] word because his word is righteousness
[12:55] so now let's look at iniquity and what
[12:57] do we think iniquity would be
[12:59] iniquity would be would be taking that
[13:02] rightness
[13:03] and making it crooked now we'll look at
[13:06] we'll look at where that crookedness
[13:07] comes from crook that the word iniquity
[13:09] in the in the old testament
[13:11] comes from the hebrew word avon which
[13:14] means
[13:15] perversity or depravity
[13:17] or iniquity guilt punishment of iniquity
[13:20] the consequence of punishment for
[13:22] iniquity and brother ram defined
[13:23] iniquity is to know not to do something
[13:26] and to do it anyway and vice versa
[13:29] so in other words
[13:31] if the word says
[13:33] that you should be going to church if
[13:35] the word says that you should be doing
[13:37] it or the word says
[13:38] the words we put it like this the word
[13:40] says you need to be born again
[13:42] you need to be born again
[13:44] and you go in the other direction see
[13:46] that's iniquity working iniquity is to
[13:49] twist the word of god it's actually to
[13:51] take the word of god like like the devil
[13:53] did and
[13:55] speaking through the beast in the garden
[13:56] of eden he took the word of god which
[13:59] was thou shalt surely die
[14:01] and twisted it and made it a little bit
[14:03] crooked and bent it up and so you're
[14:06] you're not gonna you're not gonna surely
[14:08] die just a little bit got a little bit
[14:10] crooked there so iniquity is taking that
[14:12] word of god and twisting it off a little
[14:14] bit
[14:15] let's go to the next slide and an
[14:17] iniquity that word i've owned
[14:19] is related to the word ava means which
[14:21] means to bent to be bent
[14:24] and and uh
[14:26] you know you you follow all
[14:27] it's really interesting how these hebrew
[14:30] words are all kind of related that the
[14:32] same word that means like a bent a
[14:34] crooked road is related to the word that
[14:36] means like a old man with his back all
[14:40] crooked and that's related those all
[14:42] those words are related to the word
[14:44] iniquity
[14:45] avon is related to ava now let's see
[14:48] what ava means
[14:50] a va means to bend or twist or distort
[14:54] to be bent
[14:56] be bowed down be twisted or be perverted
[15:00] to twist or distort
[15:02] to do wrong
[15:04] to commit iniquity
[15:06] to commit to actually commit iniquity so
[15:08] a va that this bending the twisting and
[15:11] you think about why
[15:13] it's almost it's almost almost comical
[15:16] that god as punishment for
[15:18] for the beast twisting the word would
[15:20] turn him into a serpent that goes
[15:22] slithering and twisting and and crook in
[15:24] his crooked way through the through the
[15:26] leaves and through the bushes to as a
[15:28] symbol of what he had done he took the
[15:30] word of god and twisted it
[15:32] so there you got there you got these two
[15:34] things
[15:35] righteousness and iniquity
[15:38] now the only thing the only thing to be
[15:40] right is to get into god's word
[15:42] but to to take god's word and go the
[15:44] other direction to go the other way
[15:47] is iniquity so that's why the bible says
[15:49] that iniquity was found in lucifer back
[15:52] way before before they even the battle
[15:53] even came to the earth iniquity was
[15:55] founded and what was found in him there
[15:57] was something crooked in him that he was
[15:59] taking the word of god and going uh uh
[16:02] going a different path with it amen
[16:06] so in hebrews let's go to the next slide
[16:08] it says
[16:09] thou has a love to righteousness and
[16:10] hated iniquity we're just kind of
[16:11] continuing to dwell on that and brother
[16:13] brown says
[16:14] that iniquity is something that you know
[16:17] you ought to do and will not do it and
[16:20] he said iniquity is something that
[16:21] you've done wrong
[16:23] that you know better that you ought not
[16:25] have done it if i conceive iniquity in
[16:28] my heart
[16:29] god will not hear me
[16:32] iniquity is something that you know you
[16:34] ought to do and you won't do it you know
[16:36] better but won't do it it's iniquity see
[16:38] you know
[16:40] now here's where he's really placing it
[16:42] you know they should stay with the word
[16:45] of god
[16:46] but for the church's sake or somebody
[16:48] else's sake or something else you'll
[16:50] stray from the word of god
[16:53] and do what the organization says
[16:56] the word so straying from the word of
[16:58] god
[16:59] well i don't know my church says we
[17:01] should do it this way and i believe it
[17:03] this away see and it's right before you
[17:05] that you shouldn't do it
[17:07] that's iniquity
[17:09] depart from me you that work iniquity
[17:11] and jesus said you workers of iniquity i
[17:13] didn't even know you
[17:15] and iniquity is something that you know
[17:17] that you ought to do and will not do it
[17:20] that's right
[17:21] i see how he's placing it with the word
[17:23] a lot of times we'll get when you when
[17:24] you hear sometimes it preached on or
[17:26] whatever you begin to think well i know
[17:28] i should have
[17:29] shut the fridge door and i didn't do it
[17:31] all right i know i you know i i
[17:33] shouldn't have left that food out on the
[17:35] counter to rot or whatever that not
[17:38] we're talking let's narrow it down to
[17:39] the word it's your attitude to the word
[17:42] that's what we're talking about when you
[17:44] see the word presented plainly before
[17:46] you and you step away from it you go in
[17:49] a different direction then there's
[17:50] there's iniquity
[17:52] and he said uh that that next the last
[17:54] quote you workers of iniquity i didn't
[17:56] know you
[17:57] and iniquity is something that you know
[17:59] that you ought to do and will not do it
[18:01] and every man knows now here he's
[18:04] placing it plainly
[18:06] every man knows that he's got to be born
[18:09] again by the spirit of god
[18:11] we know that you've got to be born again
[18:13] that's the word that that jesus told the
[18:15] nicodemus jared in john chapter 3 you've
[18:18] got to be born again to so anything
[18:20] contrary to that when you begin to go in
[18:22] a different direction there's iniquity
[18:24] iniquity is what iniquity is something
[18:26] that you know it's wrong
[18:28] and still holding to it
[18:30] when you know your creeds are wrong and
[18:33] you still hold to it
[18:35] that's iniquity
[18:40] now now the remedy for iniquity if we go
[18:42] to the next slide
[18:45] in psalm chapter 32
[18:47] david said i acknowledge my sin unto
[18:49] thee and mine iniquity have i not heard
[18:51] i said i will confess my transgressions
[18:53] unto the lord and thou forgave us the
[18:55] iniquity of my sin
[18:57] and isaiah tells the story about the the
[19:00] sarah from coming with the live coal and
[19:02] it took his iniquity away so what takes
[19:04] your iniquity away
[19:06] iniquity is taken away when you come to
[19:09] the one that has the righteousness you
[19:10] come to his word and his word will
[19:13] actually take your iniquity away
[19:15] and that's why in the next verse
[19:18] or if you go to the next slide
[19:20] it says it keeps going on it says thou
[19:22] has loved righteousness and hated
[19:24] iniquity therefore god even that god
[19:27] hath anointed thee with it all of
[19:29] gladness above thy fellas
[19:32] and now that's a reward almost that that
[19:35] when you when you come to the place
[19:37] where you would rather have a nic a
[19:39] righteousness than iniquity come to the
[19:41] place where you begin to respect the
[19:42] word of god then god will fill you with
[19:45] the holy ghost now see he filled jesus
[19:47] with the holy ghost without measure
[19:49] because he was god
[19:51] god in fullness the fullness of god made
[19:54] manifest
[19:56] for us so brother ram says about that
[19:58] and we'll just have a few more minutes
[20:00] and then we'll we'll
[20:01] we'll we'll stop here he said and god
[20:03] keeps his word he said oh we're anointed
[20:06] with the oil of gladness talking about
[20:07] what the oil of gladness is
[20:09] not all out of your body
[20:11] and the whole
[20:13] nothing can come out of your body that
[20:14] can do you any good
[20:16] and the whole armor of god is
[20:17] supernatural what is the armor of god
[20:20] and he goes on and he says again in the
[20:22] green text nothing you have to see
[20:24] nothing you have to feel you got to
[20:26] believe it
[20:28] jesus never did say did you see it
[20:30] did you feel it he said did you believe
[20:32] it did you believe it so the oil of
[20:34] gladness and and a man rented from the
[20:37] presence of the lord he said pour in the
[20:38] oil of gladness this week lord in our
[20:41] souls it's the spirit quickening the
[20:44] word and you to make it come to life
[20:48] and in the next on the next slide he
[20:50] said in john chapter 3
[20:52] for he whom god hath sent speaketh the
[20:54] words of god for god giveth not the
[20:56] spirit by measure unto him
[20:58] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[21:01] the godhead bodily in colossians 2 9
[21:04] and isaiah 61 says the spirit of the
[21:06] lord god is upon me because the lord
[21:08] hath anointed me to preach good tidings
[21:10] under the meek
[21:11] so that the oil of gladness was upon him
[21:14] the whole all of the spirit was poured
[21:16] out on him and i think i think as
[21:18] christians we we have confidence to know
[21:20] that that same spirit that was in him is
[21:23] in us by the new birth to accomplish the
[21:25] same works to do the same things in our
[21:27] lives that was done in him
[21:31] and and real quick on the next slide
[21:33] just to kind of close out this this
[21:35] topic anointed by the word he is the
[21:37] anointing
[21:39] christ coming to his body he said christ
[21:41] is the word we all know the anointing is
[21:43] christ it comes on the word that makes
[21:45] the word live
[21:47] that is the anointing christ is the
[21:49] anointing the spirit that comes upon the
[21:52] word that quickens the word to make it
[21:54] live
[21:55] now the word is in your heart
[21:57] you believe in divine healing whatever
[21:59] more see and christ the anointing coming
[22:02] to his body
[22:03] see the connection there just like
[22:05] husband and wife to become one
[22:07] now the church has got to get to the
[22:09] ministry until the church and christ
[22:11] become one he can anoint you for every
[22:13] blessing that's in the bible
[22:15] all of it is yours everything is
[22:17] promised at this age
[22:19] is yours
[22:20] because that same spirit that was in him
[22:23] is in you
[22:24] and and it makes us anointed for a
[22:26] purpose if we'll go to the next slide
[22:29] now charles spurgeon said about the oil
[22:31] of gladness that he said the gladness of
[22:33] our lord lord jesus may be viewed first
[22:35] as the gladness which he had in his work
[22:38] in other words he had a purpose in his
[22:40] life he was anointed to actually to to
[22:42] accomplish something and you know i i i
[22:45] think i've said this many times before
[22:46] if you want to kind of get rid of
[22:48] depression or whatever you know you you
[22:51] find a find a purpose in your life and
[22:53] that's what the holy ghost is for us to
[22:55] give you a purpose in your life
[22:56] something to do and that's why in luke
[22:58] chapter two he said
[23:00] when his when his parents uh he he
[23:02] turned up missing and his parents came
[23:04] out uh began to look for him he said how
[23:06] is it that you sought me wished ye not
[23:08] that i must be about my father's
[23:09] business
[23:10] because he had a purpose in his life
[23:12] there was something for him to do
[23:14] and in john 4 32 he said he told he told
[23:17] the disciples when they went looking for
[23:19] him at the at the well when he was
[23:20] talking to the woman at the well and
[23:21] they and they were asking him if he was
[23:23] hungry and he said i've got meat to eat
[23:25] that you know not of and his meat was to
[23:27] do the will of him that sent me and to
[23:29] finish his work in other words he was
[23:30] anointed to do a purpose he had a
[23:32] purpose in his life
[23:34] so if you've got that oil of gladness in
[23:36] your heart you're anointed also for a
[23:38] purpose and your purpose is to fulfill
[23:40] his word just like his purpose was to
[23:43] fulfill the word of god
[23:45] in psalm 47
[23:47] chapter 40 it says i delight to do thy
[23:49] will o my god ye thy law is within my
[23:52] heart i believe every christian here
[23:54] today
[23:55] wants to do the will of god
[23:58] and we'll we'll maybe close on this
[24:00] scripture because the bible
[24:02] in hebrews chapter 1 verse 10 the next
[24:04] slide
[24:05] and and it closes
[24:08] yeah it goes it goes into the next this
[24:10] next scripture it says that thou lord in
[24:12] the beginning has laid the foundation of
[24:14] the earth
[24:15] and the heavens are the works of thine
[24:16] hands
[24:17] they shall perish but thou remainest and
[24:20] they shall wax old as doth a garment and
[24:23] as a vesture thou shalt fold them up and
[24:25] they shall be changed but thou art the
[24:27] same
[24:28] and thy years shall not fail and i think
[24:30] again you know the whole the whole topic
[24:32] of hebrews chapter one is paul's trying
[24:35] to sit
[24:36] in your mind in the in the mind of those
[24:38] hebrews who this man is that he's
[24:40] talking about and here he's kind of
[24:41] continuing on that thought that this man
[24:44] is is the unchanging god
[24:46] in the beginning he's the one that laid
[24:48] the foundation of the earth and the
[24:49] heavens are the works of his hand so you
[24:51] can see how you know over time as things
[24:53] begin to um uh the earth begins to
[24:56] change and trees fall over and get
[24:58] washed away in the river and and and
[25:00] land and the land changes but yet god
[25:03] remains the same despite how we we we
[25:06] you know we we get old and we're gonna
[25:08] get frail as we get older but yet he's
[25:10] the same his word is the same
[25:12] age after age
[25:14] now
[25:15] down at the bottom right hand corner you
[25:16] can see i i
[25:19] i guess there's a movie or something
[25:20] about los angeles sliding in the same
[25:22] sea so i i stole a picture of that and
[25:25] put it up there so you can see that even
[25:27] even law saying that god's word is going
[25:29] to be fulfilled
[25:30] and his despite everything around you
[25:33] that that uh you know things changing
[25:36] all over the place
[25:38] his word is the same thou art the same
[25:41] and thy years shall not fail
[25:44] so we'll just we'll just kind of quickly
[25:46] read
[25:46] rita if we go to the next slide real
[25:48] quick and of the angels he saith who
[25:51] maketh his angels spirits and his
[25:53] ministers a flame of fire but under the
[25:54] sun he saith thy throne o god
[25:57] is forever and ever a scepter of
[25:59] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[26:01] kingdom
[26:02] thou has loved righteousness and hated
[26:04] iniquity therefore god even thy god hath
[26:06] anointed thee with all of gladness above
[26:08] thy fellows and thou lord in the
[26:11] beginning has laid the foundation of the
[26:13] earth and the heavens of the works of
[26:14] thine hands
[26:15] they shall perish but thou remainest and
[26:18] they all shall wax old as doth a garment
[26:20] and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up
[26:23] and they shall be changed but thou art
[26:25] the same and thy years shall not fail
[26:28] but to which of the angels said he at
[26:29] any time sit on my right hand until i
[26:32] make thine enemies thy footstool
[26:34] and we'll stop there and continue there
[26:36] the next time
[26:40] god bless you
[26:41] the musicians can go ahead and come
[26:43] forward
