[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] God bless you saints. Good to be in the
[0:07] house of the Lord.
[0:09] Let's turn to uh 1 Corinthians chapter 7
[0:12] if you have your Bible. And we're going
[0:15] to continue on from the scriptures we
[0:18] were looking at in uh verses 21 to 23.
[0:22] Let's bow our heads. Well, God, we're so
[0:25] grateful for your word that you've given
[0:26] unto us in this hour. I pray God that
[0:28] you'll be with us today Lord as we come
[0:30] with expect expecting hearts Lord God
[0:32] that you'll give us what we have need
[0:33] of. Be with us in the services Lord
[0:35] Jesus. Grant and I pray Lord that you'll
[0:37] help us as we study these things out
[0:39] Lord and walk through your scriptures
[0:40] Lord. Give us the meaning and give us
[0:42] the essence of what it's saying. Lord we
[0:44] pray in your name.
[0:46] Amen. So uh let's let's take I I just
[0:50] want to take a thought this morning and
[0:52] from these scriptures that um there's
[0:53] freedom freedom under headship. And so
[0:56] what Paul is saying here in verse 21, he
[0:59] says, "Art thou called being a servant?
[1:01] Care not for it. But if thou mayest be
[1:03] made free, use it rather." So, of
[1:06] course, he's kind of telling the
[1:07] Corinthians that, you know, uh uh you
[1:10] whatever whatever kind of station you
[1:11] are in life that God can use that to be
[1:16] um whatever your job is, whatever your
[1:18] role at, whatever your position is, if
[1:20] you're um you know, back then in that
[1:22] time that they were living in, if you're
[1:23] a servant or slave or whatever you are,
[1:25] then then um you can be a a witness in
[1:28] that in that role. But then he starts he
[1:31] says for for he that is called in the
[1:32] lord being a servant is the lord's free
[1:35] man. And uh so just wanted to meditate
[1:37] on on that uh how what what maybe really
[1:40] what a strange thing that is that in in
[1:43] uh when you get moved under the headship
[1:46] of of Christ that you're both free and a
[1:51] servant at the same
[1:53] time. He that is called on the Lord
[1:55] being a servant is the Lord's freeman.
[1:58] Likewise, he also he that is called
[2:00] being free is Christ's
[2:04] servant. Ye are bought with a price. Be
[2:06] not ye the servants of
[2:09] men. And we want to kind of compare that
[2:11] with
[2:12] uh later on in that chapter. Um and Paul
[2:16] kind of gets to he he starts u framing
[2:19] up how uh kind of beginning to frame up
[2:22] how a a woman is should should be should
[2:24] treat her husband and those kind of
[2:26] things. And he says he makes this
[2:27] statement that the wife is bound by the
[2:30] law as long as her husband
[2:33] liveth. So there's there's that those
[2:36] two those two things the law the law
[2:39] where you're trying to you're just
[2:40] trying to kind of earn your salvation.
[2:43] You're trying to trying to do things to
[2:45] to appease a holy God. And and then
[2:48] there comes a place when that that
[2:51] dies. The if the wife is bound by the
[2:53] law as long as her husband liveth. But
[2:55] if her husband be dead, she is at
[2:58] liberty. Now there's the grace that you
[3:01] have by the by the the go the true
[3:03] preaching of the a living gospel brings
[3:07] liberty. If her husband be dead, she is
[3:09] at liberty to be married to whom she
[3:13] will only in the Lord. And you know, uh,
[3:17] brother Brown want to use that example
[3:18] of Abigail and Nabal that, um, that she
[3:21] she was married to Nabal and and just
[3:23] just kind of a a rough individual kind
[3:25] of terrible and David's trying to do
[3:27] good to him and he returns it with evil
[3:29] and then then Nabal uh dies and now
[3:32] she's got she's got
[3:35] liberty. And
[3:37] uh, in other words, the truth the truth
[3:40] will make you free from sin. And the
[3:43] truth will make you will give you
[3:45] liberty. In John 8:34, Jesus says, he
[3:49] answered them. He said, "Verily, verily,
[3:50] I say unto you, whosoever committh sin
[3:53] is the servant of
[3:55] sin. And the servant abideth not in the
[3:59] house forever, but the son abideth ever.
[4:01] If the son therefore shall make you
[4:03] free, ye shall be free indeed."
[4:08] And again in verse 30 he said as he
[4:10] spoke these words many believed on him
[4:12] then said Jesus to those Jews which
[4:13] believed on him if you continue in my
[4:16] word then are ye my disciples indeed and
[4:21] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[4:25] shall make you free. Now the truth uh so
[4:28] again we're meditating on what Paul said
[4:30] in verse 22. He that is called on the
[4:32] Lord being a servant is the Lord's
[4:34] freeman. Likewise also he that is called
[4:36] being free is Christ's servant. That
[4:40] when you move under the headship of
[4:43] Christ, it makes you free from from all
[4:47] that all all that past that you've been
[4:49] living in. like uh you know just kind of
[4:52] meditate on the um when they came over
[4:56] the the Red Sea and they watched all the
[4:58] Egyptians be washed away and there
[5:00] Miriam took up that tambourine and
[5:03] started to rejoice. You you think about
[5:05] what made her made her rejoice to to to
[5:09] think that to look back and see all of
[5:11] those that no more brickmaking. I'm
[5:13] never going to have to make another
[5:14] brick. No more whips. No more task
[5:18] masters. Now, now that's the the literal
[5:21] servitude that sin brings under back,
[5:23] you know, back then. But it it that
[5:26] that's the same effect that a life of
[5:29] sin has to an
[5:31] unbeliever. No, no more hiding. No more
[5:34] hiding male children. No more sneaking
[5:36] around. No more hindered
[5:39] worship. No more
[5:41] humiliation. Miriam picking up that
[5:43] tambourine. I I ain't got to deal with
[5:45] none of that anymore. she'd never have
[5:47] to walk without God's presence again all
[5:51] the way through the wilderness of Israel
[5:52] that the the wilderness that they uh
[5:54] that they followed behind the pillar of
[5:56] fire. A and my you think you think about
[6:00] uh you know they say that there was that
[6:01] was uh with all that multitude that came
[6:04] over the Red Sea that was um about 20
[6:07] 20,000 women at that time. So it wasn't
[6:10] just Mary. You think about the praise
[6:11] that that was taking place there when
[6:13] they come over because what what was it?
[6:16] The truth that they had heard that they
[6:20] were following had given them liberty by
[6:22] destroying their past destroying washing
[6:25] all that away. Now, now there's there's
[6:28] really what Paul's talking about. The
[6:29] wife is bound by the law as long as her
[6:33] husband
[6:34] liveth. But but now when all that's
[6:37] dead, when it's washed away, Amen. Now
[6:40] she's got liberty. Now you got liberty
[6:42] to be married to Christ.
[6:45] And so it's got to be it's got to be
[6:47] dead. It's got to be washed away. And
[6:49] you know we when you go out there and
[6:51] and you signify your faith by being
[6:53] baptized in the name of Jesus, that's
[6:55] actually
[6:57] symbolizing really what happened there
[6:59] with Mary crossing the Red Sea. It's all
[7:01] washed away. I'm being uh going down in
[7:04] I'm going down in the water to identify
[7:07] myself with Christ. And Jesus is the
[7:11] truth. And knowing Jesus is what sets us
[7:15] free. John 8:36 says, "If the son
[7:19] therefore shall make you free, ye shall
[7:20] be free indeed."
[7:23] In Romans chapter 6 22 it says, "But now
[7:26] being made free from sin and become
[7:29] servants to
[7:31] God, you have your fruit unto
[7:34] holiness and the end everlasting
[7:38] life." Second Corinthians, Paul said,
[7:41] "Now the Lord is that spirit, and where
[7:44] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[7:47] liberty."
[7:50] In Romans chapter 8, Paul said, "For the
[7:52] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[7:56] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[8:00] sin and
[8:02] death." And Galatians, Paul said,
[8:04] "Wherefore, thou art no more a servant,
[8:07] but a son, and if a son, than an heir of
[8:11] God through
[8:12] Christ." So freedom, you you know, we're
[8:15] talking about freedom. It doesn't come
[8:17] from from uh escaping Pharaoh. It
[8:20] doesn't come from escaping Rome. It
[8:23] doesn't come from escaping a legal
[8:24] system, but it comes from knowing Christ
[8:27] and walking in his spirit. Amen. And
[8:30] being delivered from sin's grip and the
[8:32] fear of death. It's about knowing Jesus.
[8:36] In Matthew chapter 7, Jesus said,"Many
[8:39] will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
[8:40] have we not prophesied in thy name, and
[8:42] in thy name have cast out devils, and in
[8:44] thy name done many wonderful works. And
[8:46] then will I prophesy unto them, I never
[8:48] knew you. Depart from me, ye that work
[8:50] iniquity." So, you can tell from that
[8:52] scripture that knowing Christ is is more
[8:54] than just religion. It's a personal
[8:56] relationship. I I was riding around with
[8:59] my wife this weekend or uh or recently
[9:03] and we we just passed by all these uh
[9:05] little like lodges on the side of the
[9:07] road. There's a a lodge for policemen.
[9:10] We passed by. I was getting work on my
[9:11] car and there was a lodge for policemen
[9:13] and a lodge for this and a lodge for
[9:15] that. And you know that's what brother
[9:16] Ram would say that a lot of churches
[9:18] have become is a lodge and a lodge is a
[9:20] place where you come to just do to to
[9:23] see one another and to do things. But
[9:26] the difference between a lodge and a a a
[9:28] real church of the living God is the
[9:30] life because it's about knowing Christ.
[9:33] You know, you can actually you can
[9:35] actually come to church and and and
[9:37] recite things and and learn and and
[9:40] whatnot, but that will not actually give
[9:43] you freedom. But when you enter into a
[9:45] personal relationship with God, that's
[9:47] where freedom begins to come. and
[9:49] liberty. Liberty. Liberty is when you
[9:52] actually see a supernatural God come and
[9:54] wash away the past, wash away all the
[9:56] sins and make way for you to enter into
[9:58] a relationship with Christ. Amen. And
[10:01] and so what I'm framing up is to know
[10:03] him. To know him is freedom. To know him
[10:06] is liberty. That's right. And Paul would
[10:08] talk about coming under headship that
[10:11] you're you're you know, he he would
[10:13] frame it up that God is the head of all
[10:15] of us. God is the head of the man and
[10:19] the man has to conduct himself in a in a
[10:21] certain way, look different. His
[10:24] hairstyle even has to be different to
[10:26] signify difference between a man and a
[10:29] woman. What's he framing up? Headship.
[10:32] And then the man is over the woman in
[10:35] headship. And if you fra if you put that
[10:37] all together, when you come under
[10:39] headship correctly, then that brings
[10:42] liberty. When you've got a church under
[10:45] headship correctly, when you've got a
[10:47] father under headship to God, when
[10:48] you've got a woman that's under headship
[10:50] to the father and and the children under
[10:52] headship and everything moving right
[10:54] along, then then now you've got real
[10:58] liberty to know Christ to know Christ is
[11:01] where that freedom is. And uh I'm just
[11:05] reading a couple of quotes. Brother Ram
[11:06] said, "And God is a provided way." He
[11:09] said, "We ch send our children away to
[11:11] Bible school and colleges and we learn
[11:13] them the Bible. What good does it do to
[11:16] know the Bible if you don't know the
[11:20] author?" The Bible doesn't say, now
[11:24] here's here's a statement now that the
[11:26] Bible doesn't say to know the word.
[11:28] Satan knows the word better than any
[11:31] student in the world. That don't make
[11:33] him saved. It's not by knowing the word.
[11:36] as knowing him is life. To know
[11:40] him and and a greater than Solomon is
[11:43] here. He said, "Have you ever accepted
[11:44] him as your savior? Do you know him as
[11:46] your savior?" If you got your name on a
[11:48] church book and that's all you know,
[11:50] leave that where it's at. But come here
[11:52] and know him. Not to know his book is
[11:56] life, but to know him. Know him, not the
[12:01] word him. Satan knows the book.
[12:04] Certainly. A fellow said to me one time,
[12:07] I was talking about the security of the
[12:08] believer. Said, 'You don't know your
[12:10] Bible. I said, 'But I know the author.
[12:12] That's the main thing. I know the
[12:14] author. To know him is life. That's
[12:17] right. And if you don't know him, why
[12:19] not come up here now and stand right
[12:21] here in his presence. Now, see, that's
[12:24] what brings freedom. You say, "Well,
[12:26] what are you talking about, Brother Bob?
[12:27] That sounds very confusing." Well, you
[12:29] can you can read Matthew 28:19 and and
[12:31] argue and debate it about it all day
[12:33] long, but if you know Christ, he will
[12:36] give you the true essence of the
[12:37] meaning. And then now you can read,
[12:40] you're not you don't have to skip over
[12:41] Acts 2:38. You can read it with knowing
[12:44] the real what what it's really saying.
[12:47] You see that's so you can it's it takes
[12:50] it from just an argument where you're
[12:51] just debating with somebody and you're I
[12:54] I've talked to people from different
[12:55] denominations that could almost that
[12:57] that they almost run around you with
[12:59] their knowledge of the scriptures and
[13:01] things. But oh but when Christ comes
[13:04] that Christ will and when he interprets
[13:06] his word you know they could they could
[13:09] maybe they could argue up and down about
[13:11] exactly how the water was parted when
[13:13] they crossed the Red Sea. But but God
[13:16] settled the arguments when he parted the
[13:17] water. Right? When God when when Moses
[13:20] threw his staff down and and his snake
[13:23] gobbled up the others, that settles the
[13:25] arguments. You could debate all up and
[13:27] down about how it happened and what what
[13:29] happened what what it was done. But when
[13:32] God comes on the scene and makes it a
[13:34] living reality, that settles every
[13:37] argument. Now, so that's what we're
[13:38] talking about. Freedom to enter under
[13:41] headship of Christ, that to to know him
[13:44] and the power of his resurrection, that
[13:46] he's alive and well and and and not
[13:48] we're not just learning about things,
[13:50] but he's actually living living in his
[13:53] word. To know him is
[13:58] freedom. The spirit of God changes
[14:01] everything. you you know when you're
[14:02] born again it it it brother Ram would
[14:04] say the evidence of being born again is
[14:06] to it makes you agree with the word
[14:10] because agreement is unity unity of
[14:13] thought or belief alignment with the
[14:15] word and so you can see as you begin to
[14:18] align with the word is what Paul's
[14:20] framing up here as he continues on in
[14:22] first Corinthians that it actually makes
[14:24] your life start to line up with the
[14:26] word. It it makes your your nature
[14:28] starts to be changed. An individual's
[14:31] very nature is being changed by
[14:33] receiving the Holy Ghost. Amen. It's the
[14:36] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[14:39] you so much that the spirit in you
[14:43] agrees with the
[14:46] word. And and that's why in 1
[14:48] Corinthians chap 11, he'd say, Paul
[14:50] would make this statement. He said, "I'd
[14:51] have you know that the head of every man
[14:54] is
[14:56] Christ, and the head of the woman is the
[14:59] man, and the head of Christ is
[15:02] God. Every man praying or prophesying,
[15:05] having his head covered, dishonorth his
[15:09] head. But every woman that prayth or
[15:12] prophesieth with her head uncovered,
[15:14] dishonorth her head. For that is even
[15:17] all one as if she were saving." And you
[15:20] continue on. He said, "But if a woman
[15:23] have long hair, it is a glory to her,
[15:27] for her hair is given her for a
[15:30] covering." Now, now look, you you can
[15:32] read many many of us here have have
[15:35] looked at that scripture before with an
[15:36] intellectual understanding and not
[15:38] understood it. And then all of a sudden,
[15:40] Christ comes and you read it different.
[15:43] You talk to somebody and they just you
[15:45] can you can show them like point read it
[15:47] out. It says a woman's hair is her
[15:50] covering and and it's like it's just
[15:53] hidden. It's failed. But then when God
[15:55] takes the veil away, then you read it
[15:59] differently. Now, that's how the whole
[16:00] Bible is. The whole the whole Bible is a
[16:03] it's a supernatural book where you can
[16:05] read it with intellectual eyes and you
[16:08] just can't understand, but then God
[16:10] comes and takes the veil away. And the
[16:13] whole the whole book is like that. It's
[16:15] a supernatural book where you'll read
[16:17] you'll read the seven seals and you'll
[16:19] read what the seven stars and all the
[16:21] things in Revelation and you won't be
[16:23] able to understand maybe at first but
[16:27] then God takes the veil away and it's
[16:30] plain as day. It's almost like how did I
[16:32] how did I miss this before? Now, now see
[16:35] what what's happening though is that you
[16:37] you understand as God reveals it to you.
[16:40] Then you're being brought under headship
[16:43] and and that is what gives you liberty
[16:46] from your past from from condemnation
[16:49] from sin because you're being you're
[16:51] being brought under headship the
[16:52] headship of Christ. So what's headship
[16:55] now? That you know a man a man wh why
[16:59] why does he have to wear short hair?
[17:01] Why? Why does he have to wear? Because
[17:03] man, a man is the symbolic
[17:06] representation of Christ on earth. He's
[17:10] a man dishonors God by when he if he's
[17:14] got long hair, he's he's dishonoring God
[17:16] by rejecting the role that God assigned
[17:19] to him. And and you think that every man
[17:22] in here, God has given you the role of
[17:25] spiritual headship that you you're the
[17:28] head of your home. And if you act if you
[17:32] move into the role of of a woman, you're
[17:35] getting out of your role. You're you're
[17:37] you're moving out of what God has
[17:39] assigned for you to do. A man that acts
[17:42] like a little and won't do what
[17:44] God said. Or a man that starts wearing
[17:46] his hair long, he's he's getting out of
[17:48] that role. for a man to act or appear in
[17:52] a way that blurs the god orained
[17:55] distinctions between male and female
[17:58] such as adopting a woman's like wearing
[18:01] a dress or something wearing a kilt like
[18:05] I've seen on the
[18:07] subway like what are you wearing long
[18:10] hair you you dishonor Christ authority
[18:14] over him over him and a woman on the
[18:17] other side she she dishonors her head
[18:19] her spiritual authority by cutting her
[18:22] hair short or shaving it because she's
[18:24] rejecting the visible sign of her
[18:27] God-given role. What's her what's her
[18:29] role? To be a help to her husband, to be
[18:31] a help. The the man's role is to be in a
[18:35] head and the woman's role is to help him
[18:37] out. And I tell you what, if you got a
[18:40] if you got a woman that helps, that is
[18:42] really in her role, my goodness, that
[18:45] makes it so much easier. You know, a
[18:47] man's role is when he's out there
[18:49] working, you he'll come home late. Maybe
[18:51] a lot of times you have to work overtime
[18:53] and trying to get that overtime hours
[18:56] and and you're slaving out. It feels
[18:59] like you're slaving for the for the for
[19:02] the man and so forth. And then you come
[19:04] home and your wife's got a hot plate of
[19:07] food for you and she's there to greet
[19:08] you with a kiss. You see, everything's
[19:11] you're in your role. But when you get
[19:13] home and she's trying to take headship
[19:15] and trying to tell you, I don't
[19:16] understand why wh why why you weren't
[19:19] here to you, you know, fill in my role,
[19:22] then everything gets out of cater. But
[19:25] you, she's a help me for you to help and
[19:27] support your role in
[19:30] headship. And and see I if everything's
[19:33] if if we're in our role, that's when
[19:36] things work right. That's when that's
[19:38] when you have liberty.
[19:40] where when we when we're under headship
[19:42] of Christ, that's when we really have
[19:44] liberty. And Paul's got Paul establishes
[19:47] this headship order,
[19:49] God,
[19:51] man or woman. And when a woman removes
[19:55] the symbol of submission, her long hair,
[19:58] she is symbolically saying, "I don't
[20:01] accept that order."
[20:03] You think about that that the these
[20:05] these outward things, it's like an
[20:07] outward display that something's taking
[20:10] place on the inside. On the inside, I
[20:13] don't I don't believe that's why Paul
[20:15] said that you wear your long hair. You
[20:17] wear your long hair because of the
[20:19] angels. What what angels? The ministers
[20:22] that are preaching the gospel that are
[20:24] that are laboring to to expose the word
[20:27] and share and feed you. And then you you
[20:29] you out inwardly inwardly you don't
[20:32] believe and then outwardly it's
[20:35] expressed by the way that you dress and
[20:37] the way that you the way that you
[20:39] portray. Now in ancient times shaving a
[20:43] woman's head was a sign of of of grief
[20:45] or or punishment for adultery or slavery
[20:48] or or temple prostitution and pagan
[20:51] cults and so forth. So Paul's saying if
[20:53] you don't want to wear your hair long
[20:54] then just shave it off. But that would
[20:56] be a disgrace and you know it. because
[20:58] you're totally out of of of the plan of
[21:01] God. What what short what is shorehead
[21:04] symbolize to a woman? It's it's
[21:07] basically dishonor. She's rejecting her
[21:09] headship. She symbolically denies male
[21:12] headship and divine
[21:14] order. She's she's lost her her
[21:16] distinction, her god-given gender
[21:18] distinction. She erases a god-given
[21:20] difference between male and female. and
[21:23] she's associating herself with
[21:25] shame. Short or shaved hair was a
[21:28] cultural symbol of disgrace, rebellion,
[21:30] or
[21:31] immorality. Headship, headship, we we
[21:34] think sometimes of headship is like this
[21:37] constraint like I'm bound under
[21:39] servitude. But headship is order. And
[21:42] when you got order, then you got
[21:44] freedom. That's right. When you got
[21:47] order, then then you got peace. Amen.
[21:50] when you got order everything. And
[21:53] that's why Paul's saying in verse 22, he
[21:55] that is called in the Lord being a
[21:57] servant is the Lord's freeman. Likewise,
[22:01] he also he that is called being free is
[22:05] Christ
[22:07] servant. So there's the question. Do do
[22:12] kind of point out the sisters. Do do you
[22:14] wear a dress and and long hair because
[22:16] you're afraid of what? afraid or is it
[22:19] fear or is it because Christ is your
[22:23] head? And and that goes for everything
[22:26] every all all the things that we're
[22:28] framing up. Is it because are you doing
[22:30] it out of fear? Fear fear has torment or
[22:33] are you doing it because Christ is is
[22:36] truly your head that comes from a
[22:38] personal relationship with him? What
[22:41] what is headship? Headship is like a uh
[22:44] it's like a a a door that we walk
[22:47] through. You know the head has got the
[22:50] vision. The vision and and when uh like
[22:53] the man the man has the vision for his
[22:55] home of how he wants things to be
[22:57] ordered and how he wants things to be
[22:59] structured and how everything should be
[23:00] done. And when the wife comes under that
[23:03] headship, then she's accepting his
[23:07] vision for his vision for order for how
[23:11] the home should be structured. And she
[23:14] lays aside her own vision and steps into
[23:17] the vision of her head. That's right.
[23:21] Now, that's the same thing with a with
[23:22] the bride in Christ. She might have we
[23:25] might have all kinds of ideas of how
[23:27] things should work. But then you look
[23:29] into the Bible and you see how what God
[23:32] how God is instructing you and you lay
[23:34] down your own will and you step into the
[23:37] vision of his divine
[23:39] order. God is the head. Christ is the
[23:43] head of man. Spiritual authority and and
[23:47] lordship. And man is the head of woman.
[23:50] leadership in the home and
[23:53] church. You know, it's that's one of
[23:55] those things though really it's it's
[23:57] kind of hard to get under headship,
[23:58] isn't it? You'll see people say you hear
[24:01] hear sisters say sometimes, I don't care
[24:03] what my husband
[24:07] says. It it it's that's the thing that
[24:10] we we fight, you know, and you I I I've
[24:13] heard sisters even testify when they
[24:14] were coming to the message, I don't care
[24:16] what you say that I'm not supposed to
[24:18] wear uh pants. I I need to hear brother
[24:21] Brandham say it, for example. And and
[24:23] they don't I don't care what a minister
[24:25] says. I don't care what a man says. And
[24:28] then you hear brother Brandham say it
[24:29] and you're like, okay, eat pie. And you
[24:32] you'll finally But it's that struggle.
[24:35] the struggle to lay down our own will
[24:37] and and say I'm I'm wrong and I'm I'm
[24:41] gonna do that's why you know come we we
[24:44] we almost make a new birth clinical like
[24:47] we're just learning but oh there's a
[24:49] struggle there's a death a dying out you
[24:52] got to die you got to lay down yourself
[24:54] there's birth pains and travail you
[24:57] can't have a birth without without
[24:59] coming through something without without
[25:02] coming through
[25:05] What what it would be a strange thing if
[25:07] I watched all my children be children be
[25:09] born and then come out and said, "Well,
[25:10] it was just a very clinical exercise."
[25:12] No, it was it was blood and water and
[25:16] crying and and all of that that goes
[25:18] into the birth and you can you can make
[25:21] it nail it down to where it's a real
[25:23] clinical exercise. Well, this is what
[25:25] happened. But when you go through it,
[25:28] there's a lot of things going on to
[25:30] bring her out of birth. And when the
[25:31] life comes, you know it's
[25:35] there. Headship is devotion to the
[25:38] vision and order and person of your
[25:41] head. Headship is freedom. Headship is
[25:44] liberty. Headship is about it's about
[25:47] divinely ordered responsibility and
[25:50] mutual honor. Headship means now this is
[25:54] for the men as we're about to close here
[25:55] in just a moment. Headship means
[25:57] headship means bearing the burden. Now,
[26:00] now if you really get this, this this is
[26:03] what gives liberty. A a little a little
[26:05] sister thinks she thinks, you know,
[26:07] she's married to her husband. She thinks
[26:09] she might get you might get in their
[26:10] head. I'm speaking of Christ in the
[26:12] church. Really, you think, well, it's my
[26:14] responsibility to provide for the family
[26:17] or protect the family. Praise God. It
[26:20] ain't. It's the man's responsibility
[26:24] right now. Now, if we as as as uh as the
[26:27] bride of Christ can really get that
[26:29] picture that it ain't my responsibility
[26:32] to
[26:32] provide, it's our responsibility to lean
[26:35] on him for everything that he that we
[26:38] need. Now, our role as a man in the
[26:41] church, it's our responsibility to
[26:43] provide, but as a as our role as the
[26:46] bride of Christ, our responsibility is
[26:48] just to lean on him for everything we
[26:50] have need of. That's where you've got
[26:52] that that almost like a trickle down.
[26:55] God is he he's going to provide for us
[26:58] if we'll just trust in him. But then our
[27:01] man our role as a man and the body of
[27:03] Christ is to to bear the burden of our
[27:05] family to protect, provide, and lay down
[27:08] our life as Christ did for the church.
[27:11] The musicians can go ahead and come
[27:13] forward. Submission to headship as a
[27:15] Christian is not legalism. Now there's
[27:18] there's the key difference. It's not
[27:20] legalism. It's obedience to divine
[27:23] order, not an attempt to earn salvation
[27:27] through rules. When you come under the
[27:29] headship of Christ, you're doing it
[27:31] because you love him. And you're doing
[27:34] it because you accept the vision that he
[27:37] has for the divine order of your life
[27:40] and the divine order of your church. And
[27:43] you're saying, "I want that kind of
[27:45] peace in my life. I want that kind of
[27:48] fellowship. That's what I want. I'm
[27:49] submitting myself to him, then Christ
[27:52] can come and move and do with us. That's
[27:55] why Paul says in Galatians chapter 5,
[27:57] I'll end on this. Stand fast, therefore,
[27:59] in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
[28:02] made us free and be not entangled again
[28:06] with the yoke of bondage. Ain't no going
[28:08] back to
[28:09] Egypt once once c God comes and washes
[28:13] away all that. I I I'm standing fast in
[28:15] the liberty that God has given us. Ain't
[28:18] no going back to be entangled with all
[28:20] of that yoke of bondage. Don't go back
[28:22] to the slavery of trying to earn
[28:24] anything, trying to earn your salvation,
[28:26] but just rest in Christ and let Christ
[28:27] do it. Cuz we're if we're under his
[28:29] headship, he's obligated to fulfill his
[28:32] word and make it come to pass in our
[28:35] life. All we got to do is believe him.
[28:37] God bless you, saints.
[28:39] [Applause]
