[6:02] revelations 1.
[6:07] one through three that we've been at it
[6:08] for a while
[6:11] it says the revelation of jesus christ
[6:13] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[6:16] servants things which must shortly come
[6:17] to pies
[6:19] and he said and signified it by his
[6:20] angel and to his servant john
[6:23] and by record of the word of god and the
[6:25] testimony of jesus christ of all things
[6:27] that he saw
[6:29] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[6:30] hear the words of this prophecy we're a
[6:32] blessed people right
[6:35] and keep those things which are written
[6:36] they're in
[6:38] for the time is at hand the time to
[6:40] understand
[6:42] is now upon us okay ephesians 1
[6:48] let's start reading verse 2
[6:51] grace be to you and peace from god our
[6:54] father and from the lord jesus christ
[6:56] blessed be the god and father of our
[6:58] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[7:00] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[7:02] places in christ
[7:04] according as he
[7:06] had chosen us in him before the
[7:08] foundation of the world
[7:10] that we should be holding without blind
[7:12] before him in love
[7:14] having predestinated us unto the
[7:16] adoption of children by
[7:18] jesus christ to himself according to the
[7:22] good pleasure of his will
[7:24] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[7:25] when he hath made us accepted in the
[7:27] blood that's right in whom we have
[7:29] redemption through his blood
[7:31] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[7:33] riches of his grace
[7:36] wherein he has abounded toward us in all
[7:38] wisdom and prudence
[7:40] having made known unto us the mystery of
[7:42] his will what to adopt us to put us into
[7:45] a place
[7:46] bring it to an end here in the end time
[7:49] according to his uh his good pleasure
[7:53] which he has purposed in himself
[7:56] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[7:58] of time we might gather together
[8:00] in one all things in christ
[8:03] both which are in heaven and which are
[8:05] on earth even in him now notice
[8:08] evidently there's something not
[8:10] completed
[8:12] when paul is saying this
[8:15] right
[8:16] yep
[8:17] now there's evidently something not
[8:19] completed because paul is looking
[8:21] forward to a dispensation
[8:27] a time
[8:30] right
[8:32] this is the dispensation of redemption
[8:34] right the finishing of all things so now
[8:36] paul was looking to that prophesying see
[8:40] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[8:42] of time he might gather together in
[8:44] one all things in christ
[8:47] both which are in heaven and
[8:49] which are on earth look how far the
[8:50] redemption brother brown says goes all
[8:53] the way into heaven
[8:54] even in him and also we have obtained an
[8:57] inheritance see now here we
[9:00] see drop back to us
[9:02] us then us now all right and also we
[9:06] obtained an inheritance being
[9:07] predestinated according to the purpose
[9:10] of him who worketh all things
[9:12] after the council of his own will
[9:14] that we should be to the praise of his
[9:16] glory he first trusted in christ
[9:19] in whom
[9:20] he also trusted after that you heard the
[9:23] word of truth
[9:24] the gospel of your salvation
[9:26] in whom also after that you believed
[9:29] you were sealed
[9:31] with that holy spirit of promise
[9:34] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[9:37] what now
[9:39] until somewhere later
[9:41] not there
[9:42] which is the earnest that's the new
[9:44] birth
[9:45] but there's something to come
[9:47] until the redemption
[9:49] of the purchased possession unto the
[9:51] praise of his glory and be seated that
[9:55] is blessing lord add it to the world
[9:58] all right now
[10:01] he's talking about a purchased
[10:04] possession right
[10:08] you know it's finished
[10:12] but it's not
[10:13] made manifest yet
[10:16] right
[10:17] all right now that's kind of what we'll
[10:19] we'll talk about a little bit tonight we
[10:20] get time but
[10:22] and we will try to get to our point but
[10:25] i said we'd have questions and comments
[10:26] tonight
[10:28] and uh i just want to lay down a little
[10:30] bit
[10:31] and and make sure you follow me
[10:34] it's kind of like i was referring to the
[10:36] brothers that
[10:37] when we were in the meeting just
[10:38] recently about the daniel 70 weeks i
[10:41] said now
[10:43] at least if y'all are going to come
[10:44] together to not talk about the situation
[10:46] daniel
[10:48] and and argue about what we said at
[10:50] least you ought to go listen to the tape
[10:52] right
[10:52] you know
[10:54] right you to what we've already said
[10:56] you know and not just come out and
[10:59] present what you believe but you know
[11:01] you're going to discuss it
[11:02] so if we're going to discuss redemption
[11:08] then it's very vital to
[11:10] uh
[11:11] clarify
[11:13] establish
[11:15] uh set in order
[11:17] what we think about
[11:20] and then we can talk about redemption
[11:23] and just like i was reading there from
[11:24] paul in ephesians he's going from
[11:27] present tense
[11:29] of himself
[11:31] right to future tense to you and i right
[11:35] us
[11:37] then he's going on to
[11:39] show that
[11:40] the purchase has already been made
[11:45] but it has not been applied that's right
[11:49] all right
[11:50] redemption was done at calvary amen
[11:54] he's not to have to come back in the end
[11:56] time and when i get to that in a minute
[11:58] don't have no reference in your mind to
[12:00] think that we're saying that he has to
[12:02] come back in the end time and do
[12:04] something
[12:06] it's already finished
[12:09] all right but everything wasn't
[12:11] uh
[12:14] made up or applied to mankind brother
[12:16] and said he paid the price for the jews
[12:19] and their salvation but he said because
[12:22] of their rejection
[12:24] it was not applied in their day
[12:27] all right
[12:28] so then it would have to be a time to
[12:29] apply
[12:30] right well see then that's what we've
[12:32] been trying to talk about
[12:34] is understanding
[12:36] you know that what part of the book and
[12:39] where we're at and what we're sewing for
[12:41] and and the salvation of all mankind
[12:45] because
[12:46] according to to romans 6 and 10
[12:50] it says jesus died unto sin once
[12:53] amen
[12:55] he never died a dozen times all right
[12:57] he died under sin once right
[13:00] that all might be able to live see
[13:03] and he paid the price
[13:05] there
[13:08] of a
[13:09] eternal redemption amen for everything
[13:13] that's right in him was it was finished
[13:16] he even went to hell paid that price he
[13:18] prayed our price for us right he even
[13:20] brings forth and and and comes to a
[13:24] resurrection to show that there will be
[13:26] a people in the end time that will be
[13:28] raised
[13:29] he comes to a change you know
[13:32] he goes for mortal immortality
[13:35] and the whole thing is in a redemptive
[13:38] form
[13:39] already paid for
[13:43] but it would be like me telling you you
[13:45] know
[13:46] and i'd say not now brother marlow
[13:48] i know he likes him suits and everything
[13:50] and then our store we're used to working
[13:53] and i paid for you a suit
[13:56] well i got a new suit
[13:59] let me go tell everybody i got a new
[14:01] suit six months later i got a new suit
[14:04] and something wrong
[14:05] right
[14:07] i want to see you soon
[14:09] right
[14:11] but you see he didn't understand me
[14:14] i said it's paid for
[14:16] but he had to go get him right right
[14:19] so there's parts about this redemptive
[14:22] plan
[14:23] that was not made manifest back there
[14:28] that's right it's waiting until the end
[14:30] time
[14:31] that's right and thanks even to the
[14:33] redemption of the world
[14:37] see because his blood dropped on the
[14:39] earth to cleanse and claim
[14:42] it but it's in a process
[14:46] just like we are
[14:48] we're in a process
[14:50] peter says being born again
[14:53] but how
[14:56] well what do you mean i just born again
[14:57] and then you know maybe later i'll do
[14:59] this or maybe let no peter says it's by
[15:03] the incorruptible
[15:05] word of god
[15:07] right all right
[15:09] so everybody
[15:13] is not being born again that's right
[15:15] amen
[15:17] right
[15:18] now this is what i'm saying
[15:21] then ever so-called christian
[15:25] is not being born again
[15:27] if they don't have
[15:29] someone to teach them
[15:33] the fundament of the gospel
[15:36] right you understand
[15:38] not sitting there lost
[15:40] just saying they're not progressing
[15:42] forward
[15:44] they're not going on
[15:47] the bible says to go on to know the lord
[15:50] which means you don't know the lord all
[15:52] at once right you go on to know the lord
[15:55] all right
[15:56] now
[15:57] we talk about the scripture
[16:00] but do we really
[16:01] understand
[16:04] that jesus said you shall know the truth
[16:09] and the truth shall set you free
[16:11] now
[16:13] if that's right according to
[16:15] the english language
[16:19] he's making a statement about the truth
[16:24] but his point is
[16:27] you shall know the truth
[16:30] but everybody doesn't know the truth
[16:32] right amen
[16:34] right
[16:35] right
[16:36] i mean now come on you're in a
[16:37] trinitarian thought or concept
[16:39] you're not in the truth
[16:41] i don't care how much letter of the word
[16:44] you can quote to me how much you can
[16:46] memorize it
[16:48] you're not in the truth
[16:52] jesus said i am the truth right amen
[16:56] well
[16:58] if we're not in the revealed word of the
[17:00] hour
[17:02] right that's it
[17:03] now are you listening
[17:05] then we can't claim to be knowing truth
[17:08] that's right
[17:09] like i've always tried to tell you it's
[17:10] not to know about truth
[17:12] right
[17:13] that's what people want to do they want
[17:15] to know about truth
[17:17] and they call that truth
[17:20] you know i mean you go ask a trinitarian
[17:22] is he
[17:23] is he in the truth he'll tell you to
[17:24] hurry i mean the truth
[17:27] you say well what about jesus saying i
[17:29] am
[17:33] the truth right
[17:35] yeah jesus is the truth i believe him
[17:38] no he said i am
[17:41] that i am is the same word that he spoke
[17:44] to the little one that said we believe
[17:46] the messiah is coming he said
[17:48] the one that's speaking to you that's me
[17:49] i am
[17:54] see if you're not into truth
[17:57] how can you say that you're serving god
[18:01] that's right
[18:04] i'm not saying saying that you're not
[18:06] serving
[18:07] some god or a form
[18:09] or a thought
[18:12] but then you'd have to admit that the
[18:14] biggest portion of the world
[18:18] is not serving the true god amen agree
[18:24] now those it hasn't hurt that's what
[18:26] we've done sunday and i want to read
[18:30] every how you say it i want to say over
[18:31] again a little bit
[18:33] to make sure you follow me
[18:37] see god understands
[18:40] right right yep
[18:42] and that's our problem we say god knows
[18:45] my heart
[18:46] well if he didn't know my heart i might
[18:48] be all right
[18:49] but that's the problem
[18:52] now you and i can't say it we can't say
[18:55] that god will wink at her ignorance and
[18:57] brother dale do we have to know
[18:59] everything
[19:03] no but how could you have salvation
[19:08] now i'm asking this seriously question
[19:10] to you
[19:13] how can you have salvation believing in
[19:16] buddha as a god
[19:18] yeah right
[19:23] come on now i mean is there any
[19:25] salvation in that
[19:26] right
[19:28] is there any salvation in believing of
[19:31] any god
[19:33] other than the one true and living god
[19:35] right
[19:36] amen all right
[19:39] and we'll get back to that in a minute
[19:40] because that's what i was trying to say
[19:41] sunday
[19:43] and i i just had to drop my thoughts and
[19:45] leave it
[19:48] those people
[19:51] i covered the the groups of people
[19:55] and then all of those groups of people
[19:57] all of them were related or connected to
[20:01] the worship of that one true god amen
[20:04] whether it would be jehovah the old
[20:06] testament
[20:07] you know or jesus or the new or whatever
[20:09] you want to call it
[20:12] and i had no reference to anyone outside
[20:15] of those that had worship of that god
[20:21] not a god
[20:23] or some god
[20:24] right go
[20:25] if it's not the truth what's the
[20:27] difference
[20:29] right if you're not going to believe
[20:30] truth what's the difference
[20:32] right you can call him buddha hindu
[20:35] whatever who did who did he watch you
[20:36] know
[20:37] right
[20:40] joe jim charlie or anything
[20:44] because it'd be the same god you'd be
[20:45] talking about
[20:48] because it's not but one true and living
[20:50] god right now
[20:52] in his name is jesus christ
[20:55] that name was not used in the old
[20:57] testament it was jehovah
[21:00] yahweh
[21:02] elohim
[21:04] different forms were used
[21:07] to express that god
[21:10] but now there's no salvation
[21:12] there's no uh god winking at ignorance
[21:16] of people that are taught wrong
[21:20] and worshiping buddha
[21:27] i know that
[21:29] requires you to think a little bit
[21:33] see there's no salvation in any other
[21:35] god amen that's right
[21:38] there's no salvation in any form
[21:41] of those things
[21:44] he said but those are honest people
[21:48] good
[21:50] sincere yeah
[21:54] but now that's my emphasis
[21:57] that was what i was trying to get out
[21:59] sunday
[22:00] that you don't have salvation in any
[22:03] other
[22:05] form god thoughts ideas
[22:08] or anything that are not related
[22:10] to the one true and living god all right
[22:14] amen
[22:17] you said but what about my family well
[22:20] that's right
[22:21] what about you right that's right right
[22:24] it's not about your family because right
[22:26] there's they're standing between them
[22:28] and god right that's right
[22:31] but you see god did wink at ignorance
[22:36] but now i'm i'm going to try to make it
[22:38] as great as good as i can do
[22:40] that even while we were believing in the
[22:42] trinity
[22:44] we were still trying to relate our
[22:46] thoughts
[22:47] within the form of that one god
[22:51] right right whether we believed in god
[22:54] in three persons or whatever
[22:57] you know and that's why your foolish
[22:59] virgins
[23:02] can come up at the white throne judgment
[23:06] and receive eternal life
[23:09] that they have a confession
[23:13] right
[23:15] but not a possession
[23:20] right
[23:21] but you don't qualify for a food foolish
[23:23] virgin
[23:24] to be a muslim or hindu whatever right
[23:28] now
[23:29] i covered that so that was in the
[23:32] message
[23:34] they can be good to you or good to
[23:36] somebody
[23:37] right and that's why it's based upon
[23:40] a cup of water
[23:41] in my name
[23:43] it's not based upon the cup of water in
[23:45] buddha's name right right now right man
[23:48] are you listening
[23:50] it's a cup of water in my name
[23:52] right
[23:53] right a foolish version will only apply
[23:55] then to a person who would have some
[23:57] relationship or form to those of
[24:01] the true
[24:02] god that's right
[24:08] maybe you want to write your questions
[24:10] you might have some on these
[24:12] but i try to make it as plain as i can
[24:15] because i realize that i'm talking to
[24:17] people that maybe did not connect onto
[24:20] the first service and hear us you know
[24:23] i'm trying not to leave it such of a
[24:26] vast gap until
[24:28] there wouldn't be any understanding
[24:31] you see there's no salvation in
[24:33] worshiping any or any connecting a form
[24:36] of salvation
[24:37] connected to any other god outside of
[24:40] the one true and living god all right
[24:42] because there is no other god
[24:46] now are you listening i said a foolish
[24:48] virgin could qualify
[24:51] for a cup of water in my name
[24:55] but that's still related to jesus christ
[25:00] are you listening
[25:01] they would still be related into
[25:04] the form of the true worship
[25:07] it would not be just being good to a
[25:09] buddha
[25:11] or another hindu
[25:14] you know
[25:16] that would be a foolish version
[25:18] right amen
[25:20] i know these are plain statements that
[25:21] maybe you've never considered
[25:23] but i've done a lot of them sunday that
[25:25] i hope you listen to that type over and
[25:27] over and over
[25:30] and anybody didn't hear it i wish you
[25:32] would
[25:33] as i said while ago people make
[25:35] statements and just lambast you about
[25:37] some when never hearing the
[25:39] the what you saying right i don't
[25:42] believe him
[25:43] don't believe what you don't even know
[25:45] what i play
[25:47] yeah
[25:49] go back and listen
[25:52] and then say i don't believe it
[25:54] right
[25:55] then you got
[25:56] you're in good shape with god or you're
[25:57] in bad shape
[25:59] so it's left up to you
[26:01] but listen church do you understand what
[26:02] i'm saying
[26:04] i place base everything sunday upon
[26:08] the everybody that would ever have any
[26:11] form of salvation
[26:15] whether it be bride
[26:17] foolish virgins
[26:18] uh physical jew 144 thousand two
[26:21] witnesses uh whatever you know
[26:25] that it would still have to be related
[26:28] to their belief
[26:30] their faith
[26:32] their connection their their
[26:35] life is dependent upon
[26:37] them in that form of worship
[26:41] of the true god
[26:44] because there's no worship outside of
[26:45] that
[26:46] sure jesus christ died for all yeah
[26:51] but if you won't believe in him right
[26:56] that's why i thank god that
[26:58] this prophet could tell us
[27:02] some things that we didn't know right
[27:04] amen that's right
[27:07] about the truth of redemption
[27:10] now
[27:12] we're not talking about everyone
[27:17] in the world to be saved
[27:21] i remember about years ago a man
[27:22] preached a message in this message
[27:24] he called it the place for everybody
[27:27] well there there is a place for
[27:28] everybody
[27:30] but
[27:31] i wouldn't want to go to one of those
[27:32] places that's going to be a lot go-to
[27:35] right
[27:37] i want to be in a redemptive place
[27:39] don't you
[27:40] all right now listen then
[27:44] then to know the truth
[27:46] not know about truth
[27:50] but to know the truth
[27:52] that that truth could say i am
[27:57] are you following me right that the
[27:59] truth that you could follow
[28:01] could say i am
[28:04] but jesus said i am all right
[28:09] i'm the way the truth right
[28:12] right
[28:13] so if you want to know
[28:14] truth
[28:16] where do you go to where's nominee no
[28:21] you have to go to the bible
[28:24] and to go see what god said
[28:27] and the plan and way that he made for
[28:29] all of us to
[28:31] be redeemed
[28:33] but remember
[28:35] all could have received it
[28:39] but all will not receive it
[28:44] and then thereby he'll be able to judge
[28:46] them
[28:47] because they'll have some form
[28:51] of
[28:52] uh
[28:53] connection
[28:56] but johnny and i were talking about it
[28:57] yesterday
[29:00] so you think about that jesus went and
[29:02] preached to the spirits in our souls in
[29:05] prison
[29:06] but now it specifies who they were right
[29:11] now i i don't have time always to
[29:13] explain something but i try
[29:16] see he never went to preach to the souls
[29:19] that were in prison in the days of
[29:21] abraham right that's right
[29:24] the days of of uh ezekiel
[29:28] or isaiah
[29:30] he specifically stated who he went to
[29:34] was to those in the days of noah
[29:37] which meant goes from
[29:39] genesis 1 you know the creation
[29:41] up to the first 2 000 years because
[29:44] that's where noah came into existence
[29:46] and the world was cleansed
[29:48] those people had only
[29:50] um
[29:52] partial
[29:56] yet it was a world as populated as this
[29:58] world because ecclesiastes says
[30:01] there's nothing new under the sun
[30:05] the prophet said that this there's
[30:07] people that are just like people today
[30:09] right
[30:11] but see jesus had to go there
[30:14] to speak to those
[30:16] that were back before the beginning of
[30:18] abraham
[30:19] and the prophetic laws and the prophets
[30:22] coming into being because those people
[30:25] only had enoch
[30:27] uh they would have had
[30:30] coming down to noah they had like we
[30:33] were talking about like seth
[30:34] uh you know
[30:37] a few connections
[30:39] that they would have had to
[30:40] you know have been connected there's no
[30:42] listing of any prophets right
[30:45] right
[30:47] you know from from genesis right
[30:49] in coming to the flood
[30:51] so jesus had to go preach to him right
[30:55] but there was no redemption for him
[30:57] right
[30:59] that's correct because
[31:03] that they rejected and
[31:05] they went wrong on what little bit they
[31:07] didn't know right that's right
[31:09] and we're condemned our bible
[31:12] that's why when brother random will
[31:14] cover
[31:15] the countdowns of different messages
[31:17] then it goes to paradise
[31:20] you'll always begin with abraham
[31:25] and what's that
[31:27] because then we like we covered sunday
[31:30] that the paradise of the old testament
[31:34] could be called the bosom of abraham
[31:36] amen
[31:38] right
[31:39] right
[31:41] see because
[31:42] then there begins the prophets the
[31:45] the the word being more
[31:47] uh brought out into the open as a
[31:49] condemnation whereas from
[31:52] genesis one to i say that you know go to
[31:54] mankind i think right but run said when
[31:57] he went there he said he told them
[32:00] i am the seed of the woman right
[32:03] that was genesis 3 16 verse 15
[32:06] right
[32:08] because he had to go there
[32:10] because there was no prophetic utterance
[32:12] to condemn right that's right
[32:16] all right you see i don't have time to
[32:18] explain everything
[32:19] i i try to preach and everybody thinks i
[32:21] drag my legs out you know well he's been
[32:24] on this for three months on one thing
[32:26] i'd say six months right there in
[32:28] genesis 1.
[32:30] and never get out of it
[32:32] you ought to know that
[32:34] but
[32:36] see i was trying to lay down something
[32:38] someday
[32:40] and the main thing was that no matter
[32:43] where mankind is
[32:45] and showing this like that that jesus
[32:48] had to go to that group of people
[32:51] he couldn't leave him without a
[32:55] a condemnation right right or a witness
[32:58] we call it that's a better way i guess
[33:00] that's right a witness
[33:02] you had to witness to them that he was
[33:05] the seat of the woman right
[33:08] and the dead turned that down
[33:10] and you think about it seven billion
[33:13] people in the world today how many was
[33:14] in the world before the flood everybody
[33:16] that's right ah they were just 14 or 12
[33:18] of them maybe 10 of them that's what we
[33:20] think about
[33:23] we don't think about a large group right
[33:25] we're really struck and i'll get back to
[33:27] it in a minute
[33:28] then we'll run around and say that
[33:29] heather to be raised up in the
[33:31] millennium
[33:34] is it going to be 14 of them 12 of them
[33:40] their hammond is going to be there
[33:44] all
[33:47] that are supposed to be there that's
[33:49] right which could be millions and
[33:50] millions and millions and millions and
[33:53] millions of trillions
[33:59] they've never heard the gospel
[34:02] god's great god amen whether you think
[34:04] about it or not i'm trying to show to
[34:06] you god's great god that's right that he
[34:09] would think about those people
[34:12] he doesn't judge anybody
[34:16] without first giving a witness
[34:19] correct amen you're following me all
[34:21] right so he had to be a witness
[34:23] right to those that were in
[34:27] hell
[34:28] or whatever the word would be used for
[34:30] the place of abode of those from
[34:33] genesis up to noah right
[34:37] he's a great god amen
[34:39] that's right and he considers everything
[34:42] he considers whether you've heard of him
[34:44] or not that's right
[34:48] considers whether you've heard the truth
[34:49] about what you've heard of him
[34:52] he's a wonderful god
[34:54] amen we're not talking about some petty
[34:56] pattern
[34:58] you know that's
[34:59] running down we don't know where they
[35:01] were going to be where where's the
[35:03] scriptures gonna be
[35:04] brother ryan said it
[35:06] one day i'll find it and read it to you
[35:08] but he said it amen now if you're gonna
[35:11] believe it was a prophet okay if not
[35:14] go on to john
[35:16] right
[35:19] a lot of things brought around and said
[35:20] it takes a while
[35:22] before you find the scripture
[35:24] but you know what you'll always find it
[35:26] that's right you'll just keep searching
[35:29] all right now think about what i'm
[35:31] saying
[35:34] only those who are
[35:37] connected
[35:39] whatever the word's using to
[35:42] a redemptive form
[35:47] it would only be those connected or
[35:49] related to the true
[35:52] and living god
[35:55] that's why jesus died once
[35:58] for all
[36:00] amen
[36:01] all right amen
[36:03] and the scripture actually you know you
[36:04] look it up and say well well the bible
[36:05] don't say jesus died once foreign
[36:12] all right we use brother branham a lot
[36:14] of times when what he's saying is
[36:15] correct but the scripture
[36:17] is a little different wording right
[36:20] of your understanding
[36:22] that's why when we were back there in
[36:24] the
[36:25] talking of the
[36:26] the tribes over in the book of
[36:27] revelations
[36:29] the brother branham will state he said
[36:31] in revelation 7
[36:34] dan and ephraim is missing
[36:39] he said and
[36:41] joseph and levi
[36:43] is put in
[36:45] but then you go to read revelation 7 you
[36:48] finally it doesn't mention ephraim
[36:51] it only mentions dan
[36:55] and i've tried for all of ever since
[36:57] i've been in this message it's about it
[36:59] to get people to believe that there was
[37:01] originally supposed to be in 13 tribes
[37:03] and you don't never hear anybody talk
[37:04] about that right
[37:06] is it because they don't understand
[37:10] i talk about what i understand i don't
[37:11] know what you talk about
[37:15] but without having it the way the
[37:16] prophet put it together
[37:20] but when you do see it there was a 13
[37:22] tribe amen yes sir
[37:25] that ibrahim and manasseh was placed in
[37:28] to the 12
[37:30] sons of
[37:31] jacob
[37:32] making it 13 pull joseph out put him
[37:35] over because the tribe was never the
[37:36] prophet said to be named after him
[37:39] but it was because of the fallen what
[37:42] man done
[37:43] but then when you do dan and ephraim is
[37:45] missing out of the book of revelation 17
[37:47] that seventh chapter
[37:49] why because it was supposed to been 13
[37:50] tribes right right
[37:53] i love it like that
[37:56] i love it when i stand behind what he
[37:58] says
[37:59] and they'll just all tie together
[38:02] maybe that's why we don't get so many
[38:04] comments about what we preach i guess
[38:06] but maybe it's hard to argue with an old
[38:08] dude like me
[38:12] whatever i am
[38:14] but now i want to review just a little
[38:15] bit because we've already been doing a
[38:17] lot
[38:18] now uh
[38:19] we covered the groups of people that
[38:21] would be involved in redemption
[38:25] and we we showed that they would have an
[38:27] out of and in two form to their
[38:30] salvation
[38:32] and that
[38:33] their belief in god
[38:35] their uh you know thoughts of god the
[38:38] jehovah god now not talking about i said
[38:40] i keep saying it not talking about this
[38:42] hey god
[38:46] there's nothing i covered is any way
[38:48] related to belief in just any form of
[38:50] god
[38:51] it's all related even the foolish
[38:52] virgins would be related to a belief in
[38:55] a form of god being maybe god in three
[38:58] persons blessed trinity but still
[39:00] related back to to
[39:03] jesus christ
[39:06] so now we covered the
[39:08] old testament saints
[39:10] and in that covering i made some
[39:12] statements that you know i had never
[39:15] made before because i really didn't
[39:16] understand it before
[39:18] and maybe i don't know so just pray for
[39:20] me
[39:21] and you know just
[39:23] let it be that way
[39:25] but i said there's a the old testament
[39:27] saints that raised with the lord jesus
[39:32] i don't believe they raised in mortal
[39:33] bodies right you said when i run around
[39:36] and said so it's i know all the quotes
[39:37] right
[39:38] no problem
[39:41] well you're trying to correct him no no
[39:45] no i'm trying to state something of my
[39:47] own belief
[39:49] but the reason of that belief
[39:54] is the scripture says that no man of the
[39:56] preacher has approached amen they're in
[39:58] timothy no man has approached
[40:01] immortality it said jesus christ
[40:04] now you know if you can bring that and
[40:07] tie that into what you're talking about
[40:10] then
[40:11] all right
[40:12] that's okay i'll listen
[40:15] but
[40:16] i believe they raised in theophany form
[40:21] and they went to the sixth dimension
[40:23] right
[40:26] they went to paradise
[40:27] because paul was taken to paradise
[40:30] because paradise was taken up remember
[40:32] we covered that and paul said he went up
[40:34] to paradise
[40:36] well they must ever be a paradise
[40:39] which is not like the old testament
[40:41] paradise
[40:43] it would be changed to a form and
[40:46] connecting to the belief of jesus christ
[40:51] and what all of them spoke of
[40:54] you know right
[40:57] and see then that old testament saint
[41:00] they would go under the altar
[41:03] and i said it you go ahead because if
[41:05] you believe that they raved in mortal
[41:07] bodies
[41:08] then you don't have to raise them up to
[41:09] take them into the millennium right
[41:13] so if that's what you want to believe
[41:14] about it
[41:15] go ahead because my point was they're
[41:17] going to be in the millennium that's
[41:18] right
[41:19] not every old testament person right
[41:23] but the predestinated right
[41:26] the israel of god amen
[41:29] because israel is the name of redemption
[41:30] right right
[41:32] so those old testament signs
[41:36] the ones that raised with jesus
[41:41] they will one day
[41:43] step into the millennial run right
[41:45] and say well you can't prove that well
[41:47] you can't prove they won't
[41:49] we're sitting in a stalemate i guess
[41:52] i ain't worried about it because i'm
[41:53] going to argue with you
[41:57] i'm just going to state what the prophet
[41:59] says
[42:00] as much as i can the millennium will be
[42:03] israel as a nation
[42:07] that's only seven seal if you don't live
[42:09] nowhere else i've listened to it
[42:11] yesterday
[42:12] it's israel as a nation in the
[42:14] millennium a promise to david that's
[42:16] correct amen
[42:18] well is it only going to be 144 000
[42:21] jews
[42:25] we've already proved it's got to be 144
[42:28] 000
[42:29] plus twenty four thousand
[42:30] in the millennium
[42:34] so why not just lay down your thoughts
[42:36] and listen
[42:37] and pray for me
[42:41] see by them being taken up though
[42:44] irregardless of whether eternal
[42:46] immortal bodies or whether that's
[42:48] theophany regardless of the point
[42:52] i believe they'll be in the millennial
[42:54] reign
[42:55] right
[42:56] all right
[42:57] because they don't have to go
[43:00] to the white throne judgment
[43:03] they're already raised up
[43:07] they've already entered paradise
[43:14] anyone that would enter paradise would
[43:16] not have to go
[43:17] to the white throne
[43:20] right that's right
[43:25] i know that requires a little thinking
[43:27] but
[43:28] consider it
[43:35] so we dealt with that group of people
[43:39] all right
[43:41] and we saw that they could be in the
[43:42] millennium
[43:44] they build a temple
[43:46] and all like that because when we come
[43:47] back it's a honeymoon it's not a
[43:49] basis of working force for us
[43:55] and we come back there you know and they
[43:56] already have everything set up
[44:00] now in that millennial temple i'll say
[44:02] this before i consider it going to say
[44:03] anything else because the way people
[44:05] think you're talking about
[44:06] the millennium temple there is no uh
[44:09] sacrifice of animals
[44:11] right
[44:12] jesus christ is our sacrifice and he
[44:14] will be there to prove that they won't
[44:16] be offering animals
[44:18] just in case somebody's listening that's
[44:21] still maybe hasn't heard the truth are
[44:23] so carnal in their own concept
[44:27] there won't be any
[44:28] killing in the millennium
[44:31] will be in the offering of sacrifices
[44:34] right but you see what i'm saying that
[44:36] they would bypass or miss the lights on
[44:38] judgment
[44:40] and would be able to go to the
[44:42] millennial reign
[44:43] to be raised up any way you want to
[44:45] bring it i brought over as
[44:48] mortals eternal if that's the way you
[44:51] want to consider it to be
[44:55] then we went to the
[44:57] see that would be that form because
[44:59] that'd be the only one you can deal with
[45:01] we went to the 144 thousand
[45:04] and we dealt with them as the word
[45:06] brother branham said actually page 41
[45:09] the church age book that that 144 000
[45:11] would be in the millennial reign
[45:14] as servants to the bride amen
[45:16] so he gave the scriptures and the
[45:18] different things to to be able to be
[45:21] considered within that
[45:22] so if they go to the millennial reign
[45:25] i hope you listen to what i'm saying
[45:28] when that form of redemption is there
[45:31] that is taken part
[45:34] and then in the millennial reign
[45:36] they don't have to go to the white
[45:37] throne
[45:39] right because 144 thousand given eternal
[45:41] life right here
[45:43] that's right so what would they have to
[45:44] be judged for what's the old testament
[45:46] saints got to be judged for right
[45:50] if they're already in that place
[45:52] irregardless of whether you say mortal
[45:55] or not mortal
[45:57] it wouldn't make no difference to me
[45:59] because the same thing is going to be
[46:01] the end thereof
[46:03] all right
[46:04] but that 144 000 and it's the two
[46:07] witnesses
[46:08] they have eternal life here
[46:11] there is a record in the bible that the
[46:14] two witnesses will
[46:16] go off into rapture
[46:17] but there's no record in the bible that
[46:19] the 144 thousand go up in the rats right
[46:23] they are killed
[46:26] 144 the two innings that are raised up
[46:29] and then that's end up
[46:30] in the sixth rapture
[46:33] of the bible three and the old tree and
[46:35] the new right all right
[46:37] now then
[46:40] they don't have to go to the white room
[46:42] right amen
[46:44] they could be raised up and taken into
[46:46] the millennium
[46:48] see then you say well but i don't
[46:49] understand that raising up
[46:54] what are you gonna do where the prophet
[46:55] said
[46:59] that those
[47:01] heathering would be raised up
[47:05] paragraph 177
[47:07] questioned the nature of 1962
[47:13] he said they'd be a gospel
[47:15] because we'd have to have something
[47:17] we're going to rule and reign for a
[47:18] thousand years he said we're going to
[47:20] have something to rule over the rain
[47:22] over that's right he said they'll hear
[47:25] the gospel
[47:27] so the heathen can be raised up
[47:30] and taken into the millennium
[47:36] so you got things that could happen
[47:39] backing up into 144 000
[47:44] you're dealing there in the book of
[47:45] revelation 7 with the 12
[47:48] listing with
[47:50] danny from missing
[47:53] but in the millennium ezekiel 48 and we
[47:56] gave you all these quotes
[47:58] wrote around and said seventh seal
[48:01] ezekiel
[48:04] in the millennium in chapter 48 throw
[48:07] them back in perfect order
[48:09] which would mean 13 tribes that's right
[48:14] and he names them
[48:16] all right
[48:18] and so it would be
[48:21] the girl you're dealing with 24 000 is
[48:23] going to be raised up going to
[48:24] millenniums in some form or source or
[48:27] whatever
[48:28] so we're getting a point if you're
[48:29] understanding me
[48:31] we're getting a point of seeing that
[48:36] there's going to be good many people in
[48:37] the millennium that we can prove by the
[48:39] prophet right
[48:41] all right
[48:45] so then
[48:47] there's no argument
[48:50] in that 144 000 they missed the
[48:53] rightful judgment
[48:58] then we dealt with what would be called
[49:00] the
[49:01] fifth sealed you
[49:05] as paul was talking about that all this
[49:07] will be saved
[49:09] and we see according to the fifth seal
[49:10] there's going to be a vast number of
[49:12] jews
[49:16] that will be given eternal life white
[49:18] rose
[49:19] right and according to the scriptures
[49:21] they're giving it given unto them before
[49:24] on the fifth seal before
[49:27] the two witnesses and the 144 000 are
[49:29] killed right
[49:31] and they're told to wait a little while
[49:37] that's right and they can save can we go
[49:39] back now
[49:40] he says no these others got to be killed
[49:42] right
[49:45] so then
[49:46] fifth field you could wind up in the
[49:48] millennium because if they're given
[49:49] white robes this is prior to the muslim
[49:52] judgment
[49:54] they don't have to stand the white trump
[49:55] right
[49:58] they don't have to go to that micron
[50:00] judgment right
[50:03] it means a great thing that's right
[50:07] they can go into the millennial reign
[50:12] because they have nothing holding them
[50:17] the only groups of people that we dealt
[50:18] with was the foolish virgins
[50:22] and brother ryan said these foolish
[50:23] virgins comes out of every church age
[50:26] right amen and i went ahead and made a
[50:28] statement to it what i believe
[50:31] that there would be a form of foolish
[50:32] virgin in the old testament
[50:35] i used the word the way i mean it a form
[50:37] of or a top of right
[50:39] that would be good people but that's why
[50:41] i brought around said all that's why the
[50:43] bible stipulates that all didn't raise
[50:47] see there's going to be a general
[50:49] resurrection one day
[50:52] or the second resurrection that's right
[50:56] that they will have to be going to
[50:59] the white room
[51:02] so the foolish virgin will have to go to
[51:04] the white throne to be judged because
[51:06] she has no white robes while she's here
[51:09] or as the field shield you of any
[51:11] connection to a white robe right
[51:14] all right
[51:16] and as you do then those people will
[51:19] have to be
[51:20] judged well then i have no problem with
[51:23] bringing up all the old testament people
[51:25] that didn't go up
[51:26] when jesus went up bring them on up to
[51:28] the second resurrection as we'd call it
[51:30] and
[51:31] and bring them to the white throne and
[51:32] be judged
[51:36] all right
[51:38] but remember the key to one thing
[51:42] the millennial reign is to the jews
[51:45] that's right
[51:47] it's to the jews as a nation because it
[51:49] was promised to him right right
[51:52] now those foolish virgins don't get to
[51:54] go through the millennial reign they
[51:55] don't need to live through it right well
[51:57] because we're watching this later on
[51:59] right all right
[52:01] now
[52:05] then in the future home
[52:07] it's not listening as
[52:09] israel as a nation anywhere
[52:14] are you listening
[52:16] in the future home you're talking about
[52:19] the bride being in the city and being
[52:21] able to stay in the city
[52:24] and her attendance our servants would be
[52:27] allowed to stay where she is and we
[52:28] could go in and out
[52:30] but there's other people which would be
[52:32] known as nations
[52:34] that would come into the city bring in i
[52:37] don't understand what they mean but they
[52:39] bring in their offerings the bible says
[52:41] the prophet said it
[52:43] and they
[52:44] bring their offense they lay them down
[52:46] but they're gonna go back out of the
[52:47] city but as they go out of the city they
[52:49] do a marvelous thing
[52:51] they're capable of reaching over and
[52:52] taking a leaf off of the tree of life
[52:58] now i don't think taking the leak off
[53:00] means you're going to run out of leaves
[53:01] out of why
[53:03] i got my own thinking of that i believe
[53:05] when you pull the leave off the tree of
[53:06] life there's going to be another leaf on
[53:08] it i believe when you reach up and get a
[53:10] bunch of grapes
[53:12] you know to be able to eat one day
[53:14] that is not going to be a hole that
[53:16] you've got the grapes off of
[53:19] and what i love about it there ain't
[53:21] going to be no bathrooms in the future
[53:23] home
[53:24] because whatever you eat is going to be
[53:25] consumed in an eternal glorified body so
[53:29] it's going to be wonderful we don't
[53:30] understand what that could be
[53:32] but do you see what i'm talking about
[53:34] right
[53:35] then we tried to cover that the heather
[53:37] that would have the gospel preached to
[53:39] him
[53:41] in the millennium now i don't know how
[53:42] to deal with that i'm honest maybe one
[53:44] of these days the lord shall not talk to
[53:46] us more about it
[53:47] but until he does i don't understand it
[53:50] now if they have a gospel preached to
[53:52] them surely they must be in some way
[53:54] that they can help they can receive that
[53:56] gospel
[53:58] you know
[54:00] i mean you know why preach the gospel to
[54:02] somebody they can't receive it right so
[54:04] maybe they can receive that gospel you
[54:06] know that's going to be me and you is
[54:07] going to preach too because that's what
[54:08] the bible says we're ruling rain
[54:11] right now
[54:14] seeing those people then there will be
[54:15] some marvelous things take place as we
[54:18] see the plan of redemption for
[54:19] everything then we went on the end of
[54:21] the lights and just said a few words
[54:23] about that one day the world would
[54:24] receive a fiery baptism and the world
[54:27] would be made eternal and you'll come
[54:29] forth in the future home all right
[54:31] now
[54:33] we said and we taught it and i believe
[54:35] it
[54:36] that all of those in redemption as i
[54:39] started off with
[54:42] is related to whether or not jesus
[54:44] christ was almighty god
[54:48] amen
[54:49] you remember the prophet said
[54:51] it was dependent upon him to come down
[54:56] why because he said he would that's
[54:58] right
[54:59] to come down and die
[55:02] that we might have life
[55:05] and then he might be able to deal with
[55:06] all of these groups of people that we've
[55:08] named
[55:11] and deal with them in an honest form to
[55:13] where that he can bring
[55:14] the true ones to redemption
[55:17] so it's not just a fact of a bride is
[55:19] always going to be in heaven
[55:21] or a bride is always going to be in the
[55:23] millennium
[55:25] there's going to be a lot of people in
[55:26] the millennium
[55:30] because if you see what i was saying
[55:31] while ago when you bring them them 13
[55:34] tribes back into the original form of
[55:36] ezekiel 48
[55:37] in the millennial reign
[55:40] the levite's going to be in the middle
[55:41] and we're going to camp around just
[55:42] where it's supposed to be and you're
[55:44] going to have it beautiful as we draw it
[55:46] out from the prophet and he brought all
[55:47] the things that he told us and that way
[55:49] dan and ephraim can be put back in
[55:54] levi is taken out and put in the middle
[55:56] joseph is removed
[55:59] because joseph is the type of christ
[56:02] all right
[56:04] a beautiful plan amen
[56:06] that way you can deal with that twenty
[56:08] four thousand extra that i've always
[56:09] asked you how you're gonna deal with
[56:11] because the bible speaks of it the
[56:13] prophet speaks of it so you know well i
[56:15] never heard where he said 24 000 well
[56:17] just
[56:18] keep reading you'll find where he's
[56:20] talking about it
[56:22] you know
[56:23] but now listen
[56:26] all is dependent
[56:28] are based upon
[56:30] belief
[56:31] in the true god
[56:33] that's right right
[56:37] all redemption is based upon our beliefs
[56:40] and true god not in buddha hindu muslims
[56:44] i explained that
[56:47] a buddha could be good to a bride
[56:49] sure and receive eternal life as a white
[56:52] throne right
[56:53] virgin form but a buddha being good to a
[56:56] buddha i ain't gonna worry about him
[56:57] gonna be there
[56:59] right i'm not concerned about it
[57:01] i'm talking about the ones related to
[57:04] the worship of true god
[57:06] the one true and living god
[57:08] now
[57:10] i already asked for a raise of hands but
[57:12] i won't
[57:13] but
[57:14] i hope you raise it in your heart
[57:17] that no matter what you think about all
[57:19] that i've said about any of these groups
[57:21] of this or groups of them
[57:23] that all redemption is based upon
[57:25] whether or not
[57:26] jesus was almighty god
[57:29] or not
[57:30] amen
[57:32] i mean we should all have that as a what
[57:34] common ground or whatever point you want
[57:36] to call it
[57:37] not trying to find places or counts but
[57:40] we should all believe in the redemptive
[57:42] plan because jesus christ died for all
[57:45] the old testaments and whether it's the
[57:46] news right
[57:48] that's why he died under sin once
[57:51] yep
[57:53] all right
[57:54] so we paid those prices
[57:56] so the world was dependent upon or has
[57:59] always been salvation has always been
[58:02] dependent upon
[58:04] whether or not
[58:09] he was god all right
[58:11] that's right he said unless you believe
[58:13] that i am he right you'll die in your
[58:15] sins
[58:18] we believe you jesus
[58:22] it wasn't referring to just jesus that's
[58:25] right right
[58:27] he was saying unless you believe that i
[58:28] am he
[58:30] the jehovah of the old with jesus or the
[58:32] new now you've got it in correct order
[58:35] and you believe in it
[58:38] all right
[58:39] i told them jehovah witnesses one time
[58:41] the house ain't never been back i wonder
[58:43] about that but i told him i'm a greater
[58:45] jehovah witness than you are
[58:47] and young men how's that i said i'll
[58:50] leave jehovah the old jesus of the new
[58:53] man he wanted to talk the old man got
[58:55] him armed and let him off
[58:57] he didn't want to talk no more yeah
[58:58] maybe they put an x because i don't said
[59:00] something to them when they're out there
[59:01] i know you guys i know what y'all do so
[59:03] go ahead and put your eggs in there
[59:05] i said you put a little x by my house
[59:07] and you won't talk to me tomorrow i said
[59:09] go ahead put a little x out there but
[59:10] this won't make a difference but i'm
[59:12] going to argue with you
[59:13] i'm just going to tell you about jesus
[59:16] christ
[59:18] but now listen
[59:22] if you believe that all is based upon
[59:26] the truth
[59:29] and whether or not he is the truth
[59:33] it's all based upon him now
[59:38] right
[59:42] now
[59:44] do you realize the end that
[59:51] there's a lot dependent upon
[59:54] a group of people
[59:56] called the bride of christ that's
[59:58] right exactly right
[1:00:02] a lot is dependent upon
[1:00:04] that
[1:00:12] now not dependent upon the bases that
[1:00:14] the bride has any salvation to give in
[1:00:17] that way but
[1:00:19] she does have the ability to impart
[1:00:21] something right
[1:00:22] you want to study that quite a while
[1:00:26] brother and said if you want to do that
[1:00:28] said come on there's water out here said
[1:00:29] we'll get baptized man lord jesus christ
[1:00:32] he said it's not being you that's going
[1:00:34] to give out eternal life like highest as
[1:00:36] we give out to go to town
[1:00:38] use an army or something you know
[1:00:42] but there's a lot of dependents were
[1:00:43] left
[1:00:45] because now you agreed with me when i
[1:00:47] first started on the basis that
[1:00:52] even though salvation was paid for by
[1:00:54] jesus christ even though all was
[1:00:56] completed the world redemption
[1:00:58] everything
[1:01:00] but yet
[1:01:02] a lot of things didn't happen back there
[1:01:07] right
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:10] but jesus christ died
[1:01:14] that didn't save the world
[1:01:18] because the world didn't want it right
[1:01:20] right
[1:01:21] he paid the price for anybody that
[1:01:23] wanted it right
[1:01:27] but then the first coming of the holy
[1:01:29] ghost was on the basis now
[1:01:31] i hope you listen
[1:01:35] because on the basis of the promise of
[1:01:37] god
[1:01:38] right the day of pentecost was fully
[1:01:40] come
[1:01:42] that was not upon what any man had any
[1:01:45] connection
[1:01:47] i hope you understand now
[1:01:49] we know that the old and can connect it
[1:01:51] together but
[1:01:53] see that was the promise of god
[1:01:56] and you know those things brother random
[1:01:58] made statements that i love to think
[1:01:59] about
[1:02:00] he said god is not going to send
[1:02:03] the holy spirit the headstone
[1:02:06] on the merits
[1:02:10] of our
[1:02:11] us
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:14] he said he's going to send it because he
[1:02:15] promised it
[1:02:18] i love that i i like to take god and say
[1:02:22] now
[1:02:22] lord you promised it
[1:02:25] right amen
[1:02:27] i'm not dealing with trying to get a new
[1:02:29] car and say you promised to give it
[1:02:31] because he don't say he promised to give
[1:02:33] me a new car
[1:02:35] you know
[1:02:36] but when i find something in the word
[1:02:40] like the salvation of my family i circle
[1:02:42] that right
[1:02:46] i say that's you lord speaking to me
[1:02:49] amen says you'll be there with your
[1:02:50] offspring
[1:02:55] amen you mean your kid's going to be
[1:02:57] saved because brother dale your they're
[1:02:59] your children
[1:03:01] no
[1:03:04] grandkids or great grandkids no
[1:03:08] never have implied that right that's
[1:03:10] right but it's going to be based upon
[1:03:12] whether or not i can accept it right
[1:03:16] and then i can try my best to help you
[1:03:19] to see it
[1:03:24] and that way i can help impart it right
[1:03:30] and if my family believes it they're
[1:03:31] going to be there
[1:03:33] i don't care how bad you're living what
[1:03:35] you're doing
[1:03:36] go ahead
[1:03:40] you're going to find a
[1:03:42] bump in the road one day all right
[1:03:45] you're gonna find out you better turn
[1:03:46] around
[1:03:48] just don't make it too late because you
[1:03:50] can't override
[1:03:52] the free mortal agency of god
[1:03:54] just don't do that right
[1:03:56] just make sure that you understand
[1:03:58] you're not going to be saved because
[1:03:59] you're my children my grandchildren my
[1:04:01] great-grandchildren no no
[1:04:04] it's because that god promised me
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:09] and if you'll take that same promise
[1:04:11] he'll save you all right that's right
[1:04:13] that's right no matter how bad you are
[1:04:15] what you are he'll save you
[1:04:17] if you believe it
[1:04:19] but it's based on what i've been saying
[1:04:20] the belief in the correct god
[1:04:22] well i'll just go down here to baptist
[1:04:24] church and join up with them brother
[1:04:25] today we'll go right ahead
[1:04:32] lord's going to get you anyway that's
[1:04:34] right right stop and talk to a man one
[1:04:37] day used to come to church here
[1:04:39] oh man he's so mad at me still to this
[1:04:41] day you want him hard to look at me

[1:05:09] boy you talking about a man
[1:05:13] he used to have a bullet a german
[1:05:15] shepherd it was tough and that wasn't
[1:05:16] nothing compared to what i saw
[1:05:20] he wanted to break me into and he was
[1:05:21] capable
[1:05:23] he took a cocoa bottle broke glass cocoa
[1:05:26] bottle in the old days and break it slap
[1:05:27] him too
[1:05:29] he was that strong never seen a man with

[1:06:00] fiction or right whatever
[1:06:03] it's based upon reality right
[1:06:09] he said well what if he don't come
[1:06:13] i don't have to worry about it
[1:06:17] what if he does come
[1:06:19] you have to worry about it
[1:06:24] we could go a lot on saying how that god
[1:06:26] has spoke to us here about people and
[1:06:29] a couple of them sitting here right now
[1:06:30] and i'm looking at one in this corner

[1:06:46] there
[1:06:49] you see when he speaks to you then
[1:06:50] you're not dealing about a god of
[1:06:52] history right or another god or another
[1:06:55] form because those other gods can talk
[1:06:57] to you right that's right
[1:06:59] i hope you followed me
[1:07:02] get back to the thought
[1:07:05] we received the baptism of the holy
[1:07:07] ghost the bride of jesus christ
[1:07:10] while we're here on earth we've come up
[1:07:12] through as we've read there in ephesians
[1:07:14] to the adoption
[1:07:16] and we come to a place in that adoption
[1:07:18] until we even come to um romans 8
[1:07:22] about 22-23
[1:07:24] and it says the whole world and it's
[1:07:26] later on in message i'll get it here
[1:07:29] the whole world is groaning waiting for
[1:07:31] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:07:33] amen that's right
[1:07:36] so jesus never completed
[1:07:40] his whole work while he was here right
[1:07:44] be nicely right there with it
[1:07:47] people would argue and say word that
[1:07:48] okay we just keep it vote for them
[1:07:51] have to worry about it we we just tell
[1:07:53] you where the prophet said it
[1:07:55] all right
[1:07:59] we'll get to that just a second because
[1:08:00] i want you to read with me go ahead and
[1:08:02] pull up hebrews 11.
[1:08:05] i want you to read hebrews 11.
[1:08:09] not the whole thing we will go through
[1:08:10] it we just read a little bit
[1:08:14] going over to verse 31
[1:08:19] 33 to verse 33.
[1:08:23] talking about the people of the old
[1:08:26] testament and the new
[1:08:28] right hebrews 11
[1:08:30] about faith enoch offered them to god by
[1:08:32] faith noah by faith then come on down to
[1:08:35] the new testament right
[1:08:38] who through faith subdue kingdoms
[1:08:40] brought righteousness obtain promises
[1:08:42] stock the mouth of lines
[1:08:46] all right
[1:08:47] whence the violence of fire escape the
[1:08:49] edge of the sword out of weakness we're
[1:08:51] made strong wax violet in fight turn to
[1:08:54] flight the armies of the aliens you can
[1:08:57] go in throughout the scripture to spend
[1:08:58] weeks right there right
[1:09:00] women receive their dead raised to life
[1:09:03] again
[1:09:04] and others were tortured once not
[1:09:06] accepting deliverance
[1:09:08] that they might obtain a better
[1:09:10] resurrection because the one that was
[1:09:12] raised from the dead might have died
[1:09:13] later and went to hell
[1:09:18] true
[1:09:20] some didn't want to accept it that way
[1:09:22] so they wanted a better resurrection
[1:09:25] others had trial of cruel markings and
[1:09:27] scorching yet he moreover of bonds and
[1:09:30] imprisonment see going from old
[1:09:32] testament around me than you they were
[1:09:34] stoned they were sawed asunder they were
[1:09:36] tempted they were slain with the sword
[1:09:38] they wondered about his sheepskins and
[1:09:40] goat skins being destitute afflicted
[1:09:41] tormented
[1:09:43] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:09:46] wandered in deserts in the mountains and
[1:09:47] indians and caves of the earth
[1:09:50] what
[1:09:52] and these all haven't obtained a good
[1:09:54] report true faith
[1:09:57] received not
[1:09:59] the promise
[1:10:04] see
[1:10:06] they're still in the grave
[1:10:09] waiting
[1:10:11] right
[1:10:13] they're still in that form somewhere
[1:10:15] what do you want to call it
[1:10:17] waiting
[1:10:21] and what are they waiting on
[1:10:24] they're waiting on now don't
[1:10:25] misunderstand me so then i'll say it
[1:10:27] over and over they're waiting on jesus
[1:10:29] christ to fulfill the complete plan of
[1:10:30] redemption
[1:10:32] all right but now we've got to find out
[1:10:33] where jesus christ is at right amen get
[1:10:36] that faith and belief correct right
[1:10:38] because of the last verse
[1:10:42] having provided some better thing for us
[1:10:46] i'm glad they left it off until it come
[1:10:48] up
[1:10:49] thank you brother anderson
[1:10:53] that they without us should not be made
[1:10:55] perfectly amen perfect means complete a
[1:10:58] full age or in other words
[1:11:00] those are in the grave waiting on you
[1:11:02] and i to bring them out
[1:11:05] right
[1:11:06] they're waiting there to worry that they
[1:11:08] can come forth one day
[1:11:10] all right now let's just read some
[1:11:13] things that brother brown said because
[1:11:15] see jesus never completed everything
[1:11:18] right the dead hasn't been raised in the
[1:11:20] end time
[1:11:21] right now don't misunderstand me me at
[1:11:24] all it'll be him that raises the dead
[1:11:27] amen
[1:11:29] but it's where he's at that's right
[1:11:32] see when he came to the bride of jesus
[1:11:34] christ he had a plan
[1:11:37] not to just save the souls
[1:11:43] he paid the price for them
[1:11:50] but how would you bring up all of those
[1:11:52] old testament saints
[1:11:53] any words you put them
[1:11:58] 144 000
[1:12:01] still sealed jew
[1:12:03] foolish virgins
[1:12:05] for the heathen
[1:12:07] now the gospel preached to him in the
[1:12:08] millennium
[1:12:13] how would you do that
[1:12:17] without first considering
[1:12:20] something is going to take place
[1:12:24] that there's got to be a bride and
[1:12:27] that's right
[1:12:29] who becomes the word
[1:12:33] by her and through her let's go ahead
[1:12:35] and read a little bit look at number
[1:12:36] three
[1:12:38] take them to the spoken words original
[1:12:40] seed
[1:12:41] 1963
[1:12:42] 62-318 now if you remember this
[1:12:45] statement is from it and then the next
[1:12:47] is the church age book is taken from
[1:12:49] work that he had the word of the lord
[1:12:51] came to him and he told him to write you
[1:12:52] know the things that happened all right
[1:12:55] notice what harmony jesus never did
[1:12:57] anything until sin of the father
[1:13:00] or the father showed him first harmony
[1:13:02] between god and christ see john 5 19
[1:13:06] soul will the bride
[1:13:09] and he shows her his word of life
[1:13:11] he shows her
[1:13:13] and she receives it she never doubts it
[1:13:16] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:13:18] first the seed be planted the water will
[1:13:20] raise it up again amen then i got a
[1:13:23] great big hallelujah
[1:13:25] here is the secret
[1:13:27] the word is in the bride amen and the
[1:13:29] mind of christ to know what he wants
[1:13:33] done with the word
[1:13:35] and she does it in his name
[1:13:38] what
[1:13:39] she has does say of the lord
[1:13:43] i didn't say she had it he did
[1:13:47] now if she has it what's the next
[1:13:49] statement then it's germatized
[1:13:52] we have just said the lord the bible
[1:13:54] said thus they have the lord you're
[1:13:55] healed
[1:13:57] the bible says thus saith the lord if
[1:13:59] you believe that you're saved
[1:14:01] but then it's got to be dramatized you
[1:14:03] know made alive
[1:14:04] all right
[1:14:06] now
[1:14:07] so the holy spirit waters it until it is
[1:14:09] grown
[1:14:10] and serves its purpose
[1:14:12] they do only his will amen i believe
[1:14:14] that
[1:14:15] no one can persuade
[1:14:18] them different they have thus have the
[1:14:20] lord or they keep still
[1:14:23] that's good
[1:14:24] they will do the works of god
[1:14:28] they will do the works of god
[1:14:31] what
[1:14:34] for
[1:14:35] it is himself in them
[1:14:37] continuing his word to fulfill so now he
[1:14:40] listening it's him in them it's not them
[1:14:45] right right it's him in them right
[1:14:48] to fulfill
[1:14:49] once as he did not complete in his day
[1:14:53] all things when he was here he did not
[1:14:56] complete them
[1:14:58] he
[1:14:59] when he was here for it was not time
[1:15:10] what is it
[1:15:11] that he didn't complete going up the
[1:15:13] next right now
[1:15:16] this is taken from page
[1:15:18] 172 of the church in the book that from
[1:15:21] her to me and age
[1:15:24] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:15:27] one can make them do otherwise
[1:15:29] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:15:31] keep still
[1:15:32] they know what it
[1:15:33] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:15:35] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[1:15:38] he did not complete all his works while
[1:15:40] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[1:15:44] in and through
[1:15:46] the bride right
[1:15:48] she knows that
[1:15:50] but it was not yet time for him to do
[1:15:53] certain things that he must now do
[1:15:58] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:16:00] bride that work which he left for this
[1:16:03] specific time
[1:16:05] what is that
[1:16:08] sounds like
[1:16:10] god having provided some better thing
[1:16:12] for us
[1:16:15] hebrews 11 40.
[1:16:17] the day without us should not be made
[1:16:19] perfect
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:24] god's waiting on you and i
[1:16:27] am yeah
[1:16:29] right amen
[1:16:32] look at the next one
[1:16:36] is the eagle surface nest
[1:16:38] 64 tree
[1:16:41] it's loud
[1:16:42] paragraph or takes 38
[1:16:45] it's loud over time for the elect's sake
[1:16:48] and he's bringing it down right said
[1:16:50] it's past you like you know like it was
[1:16:52] in the day of noah
[1:16:55] wayfix but god's waiting to get his
[1:16:57] church in order
[1:16:59] he's waiting on you
[1:17:00] now may he correct your blessings
[1:17:05] you pray
[1:17:06] he's waiting on you and i that's right
[1:17:10] god's waiting on you and i
[1:17:13] right
[1:17:16] to the next one
[1:17:18] number seven
[1:17:23] whole creation groaning for we know that
[1:17:25] the whole creation growth and throat
[1:17:27] left in pain together until now
[1:17:29] why is it groaning
[1:17:31] something's wrong somebody
[1:17:33] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:17:35] have the first fruits of the spirit
[1:17:37] even we in ourselves grown within
[1:17:40] ourselves
[1:17:41] waiting for the adoption to wit
[1:17:44] the rejection of our body now how long
[1:17:46] have we been quickly on the word to it
[1:17:49] to understand
[1:17:50] the whole world has been waiting on
[1:17:52] somebody to be able to come to the place
[1:17:55] to be able to understand
[1:18:02] all right
[1:18:03] look at number seven
[1:18:06] what was the holy ghost given for 1959
[1:18:09] paragraph 51
[1:18:11] but now when we need it the spirit of
[1:18:13] god raises up a standard what is it he's
[1:18:16] pouring in his spirit
[1:18:18] then those who are resting out younger
[1:18:20] in the grave are under the altar of god
[1:18:22] as the scripture says are crying
[1:18:25] how long
[1:18:27] lord how long how much longer god's
[1:18:30] waiting on me and you
[1:18:32] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:18:34] adoption time when god can pour into us
[1:18:37] his fullness his power his resurrection
[1:18:40] that when the church in christ becomes
[1:18:42] so close together your christ becomes
[1:18:44] visible among us and raises the dead and
[1:18:47] we go in the rapture amen that's not a
[1:18:50] corporal coming right
[1:18:55] i'm trying to find one because i
[1:18:58] messed up trying to put it in but
[1:19:00] they're where the scripture says they're
[1:19:01] waiting to with the redemption of the
[1:19:02] body
[1:19:03] but around says
[1:19:05] if i don't have it in here
[1:19:09] he said the first resurrection
[1:19:11] is what they're waiting on
[1:19:13] right
[1:19:14] because in that first resurrection comes
[1:19:16] you and i right
[1:19:18] he said that's to take place at the
[1:19:19] first resurrection so if i don't get to
[1:19:21] that part you just hold on to it look at
[1:19:23] the next one number eight
[1:19:26] adoption part 3
[1:19:28] 1965-22
[1:19:30] is that right waiting god trying to
[1:19:32] place his church in position to manifest
[1:19:34] himself
[1:19:35] getting one that he can work through
[1:19:37] like this say there's my spirit flowing
[1:19:39] freely there it is that that
[1:19:41] i can work here get another one over
[1:19:43] here and place him i can place him
[1:19:47] adoption placing manifesting
[1:19:49] him out here and put a ceremony on him
[1:19:52] visiting with an angel tell him
[1:19:54] something
[1:19:55] now if he's told the truth
[1:19:58] now if he's just making up something it
[1:20:00] won't work no no that that won't work we
[1:20:03] have a lot of that but i mean
[1:20:06] i mean manifestation
[1:20:08] of the sons of god
[1:20:12] when god manifests himself and he sends
[1:20:14] himself out there
[1:20:16] and then he goes forth and what he says
[1:20:18] is truth
[1:20:19] what he does is the truth
[1:20:21] what he does he manifests christ
[1:20:24] how are you judging
[1:20:26] by the way he stays with the word
[1:20:29] how do you judge
[1:20:30] anybody but the way they stay with the
[1:20:32] work
[1:20:35] yes but he was
[1:20:36] so great at delivery ain't like you
[1:20:38] brother dale than having any cough drops
[1:20:40] to preach
[1:20:44] and then we get it done until he takes
[1:20:46] care of it
[1:20:49] watch how he stays with the word right
[1:20:50] with the word see
[1:20:51] that's how you know all men is by the
[1:20:54] way he stays with the word
[1:20:56] if they speak not according to the word
[1:20:59] there's no life in them says the bible
[1:21:01] say leave them away
[1:21:04] good point right go to the next one let
[1:21:06] me hurry up
[1:21:10] this is adoption part three this is
[1:21:12] program 163. you believe in dispensation
[1:21:15] big man in this message one time said he
[1:21:17] didn't believe in dispensation
[1:21:20] i'm sure like took him that quote but
[1:21:22] that's all right
[1:21:23] that's what he believes
[1:21:24] bible said so i'm
[1:21:26] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:21:28] time that's what the bible scripture
[1:21:29] said
[1:21:30] what is the fullness of time there's
[1:21:32] been a dispensation of this well there
[1:21:34] was a dispensation of the mosaic law
[1:21:36] there was a dispensation of john the
[1:21:38] baptist there was a dispensation of
[1:21:40] christ there's a disputation
[1:21:42] of church organization there is
[1:21:44] dispensation
[1:21:45] of the outpouring of the holy spirit now
[1:21:48] it's the discipline say now is the
[1:21:49] dispensation of adoption but the world's
[1:21:52] waiting groaning and when the fullness
[1:21:54] of time comes then the dispensation and
[1:21:56] the fullness of time
[1:21:57] what is that fullness of time when the
[1:21:59] dead rises when sickness seeks
[1:22:03] when all the earth ceases to grow the
[1:22:05] fullness of the dispensation of time
[1:22:07] watch this and when the dispensation
[1:22:09] flows down you might gather together
[1:22:12] in one all things in christ it's not
[1:22:14] without him folks aren't you glad how is
