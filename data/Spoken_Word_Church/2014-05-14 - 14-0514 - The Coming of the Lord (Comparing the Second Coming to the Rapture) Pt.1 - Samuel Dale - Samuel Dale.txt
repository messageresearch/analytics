your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and guide each one in Jesus name amen amen 1 Thessalonians 4 we'll start with verse 15-1 17 and then we'll go to First John for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the a and so shall we ever be with the Lord now we'll go over to 1 John 2 and verse 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming amen so you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word in now what I want to do we spent quite a while on speaking about the Rapture and the things dealing with the the Rapture and uh what I want to do tonight is just kind of give a a an overall view of what we'll be speaking of for the next few services I don't really know how many it'll take but we're going to be talking about the second or the coming of the Lord and uh you know dealing with the second coming more because of it being where we're at but I want to be talking about the coming of the Lord and uh you know but what I want to do tonight is I want to kind of take what we've been saying about the Rapture and then just kind of bring it over into looking at the uh coming of the Lord and uh I know that looks like two different things and you know in a way it is but in another way it's not and uh it it looks like to our human thinking that it's not related but I believe it is all right and then see we think and our mind has always been set on one thing that we we uh think of a Rapture as I said we think of a Rapture as something that's going away you know going off going to heaven whatever you want to talk about your uh doings and and all and uh you know we we relate that to the Rapture but then when you talk about the the coming of the Lord see then we we pull that as being coming this way you know all right but I believe that they are are um closely related to one another and you know in doings and and in that I want to to try to just show that tonight as a part and maybe not read a whole lot but just deal with that part because what do we found out about the Rapture see the Rapture is actually not going up as we think that's a finishing of it that's a completion of what we talk about the word rapture that not being in the Bible but it means caught up you know there in Thessalonians all but it's you know looking at it that we know for short that really all three stages of the Rapture takes place here on Earth then we're changed all right now I've been through that and over it and on all and trying to show it with Corinthians and Thessalonians and things but I hope you've you're understanding me because you know to look at it from what the prophet he said that Jesus does all three of these things in his descending well descending then relates to coming this way all right and as I said then we've been through it to prove that the prophet didn't cover it in the scriptures that see we we're going to have to be here we're going to have to be the dead is going to have to raise all right so that would be we know the message is already went forth which is the shout the Lord himself sent from heav with a shout voice of an archangel all right and we know the voice of the Archangel is the same voice that raised Lazarus and that would be the Lord Jesus Christ here among us to raise the dead you know so the Dead's going to raise before we go that way and see we're actually going to be changed right here we're not going up in the sky somewhere and then be changed it's all transpiring here amen all right and my whole point has been to try to get us to to quit looking at you know well one of these days Rapture is going to take place and they've argued in the message that we're in the Rapture and the Rapture is in us and all this that and the other ever since we've been in the message but I believe that I proved my point what I was talking about that if the shout is here which is the message then that shout would be the voice of the Archangel which would be Christ here all right then here's where we're going to be when the dead are raised all right and then we're changed and then we go away all right so that that way see then we don't have to look at it as as something uh to [Music] come we look at it as I've been trying to cover that it's already in a process and I told you where I believe it started I believe the process started in the New Birth when you were born again your soul was resurrected sitting in Heavenly places all right so then the Rapture has been in process for quite a time they are things that are not complete yet sure all right so is it when we get into the coming of the Lord that a lot of the coming of the Lord is already transpired but we're looking for it to come when it's already transpired all but now there are things that are not completely transpired yet we're still here you know we we know that for a certainty right now think about what then my point of what I'm trying to do is to compare or show or you know bring out into the open or into view to us that if the Rapture has already started in a process you know then why are we looking toward the heavens come on brother instead of looking to where we're at amen and you remember we kept emphasizing that you know the prophet said the great problem was what looking back to what had been looking forward to what will be and failing to see what's going on now and that way then we can deal with Hebrews 13 eight that he's the same yesterday today and forever all right see now the scripture should be coming alive to each and every one of us all right so now if Jesus according to paragraph 129 130 of the Rapture brother bandam says that Jesus does all three of these when he's descending all right now if that's true as I said why do we look so far away you know amen why are we longing for heaven when I thought we believed everything was coming this way amen I I thought we even believe that the future home was going to come down here amen and now I don't mean this is a joke and I don't mean it is sarcastic or I just mean it is truth why don't we want to stay here come on brother well we're getting old wor out so what so what what do that got to do with it we're good children of Abraham right 25 years it got worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and he still kept confessing all right now the prophet said paragraph 6566 with the Rapture a Rapture is a revelation right and he said the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture amen so now we're not going to be up in Heaven waiting on a revelation right I mean here's where the Revelation comes well and I told you many many years ago I quit trying to go to heaven a long time ago because I found out everything's coming this way well why do I want to go up there brother brand there about 60 somewhere right in there he's talking about uh silence in heaven he said see there ain't nothing up there well you want to go up there where all the silence is that I want to be down here where the joys going on but I'm trying to get us to see the reality of what's taking place now and quit looking off out D and start talking about what's here right that's my whole point for 3 or 4 months now it's been my whole point for 45 years really is to try to get us out of so Heavenly yeah somebody come along boy they preach a good message about the Heavenly and the glory and and you just feel so good and and I do too and you know but then when it's all over with I come find out I'm still here well I like something that you know that I can think about for a few days don't you I like for somebody to stir me up in the point in the word that that tomorrow I've got something to think about well if it's a way up yonder you know I might as well wait till I get up yonder but if I I can realize that something is taking place amen all right now I've tried to prove the point and been through it what age what time what doings that have you ever had that a people are supposed to be to the point of what I'm talking about because even in the Apostle Paul he says there's going to be you remember the prophecy how the Bible is the prophecy until revealed and Paul would say there's going to be a falling away he was speaking now may I quote brother random he said Paul was trying to get it out of their mind that another words paraphrasing because it's maybe not the wording he used but it's very close they were trying to get it out of their minds that the Rapture is coming right then when we all thought he was trying to get it in the mind that it was coming but he knew that'd be almost 2,000 years remember he saw it wouldn't it be something you sit in a meeting and Paul says look you don't parfor get out of our language today when to come out here and say y'all quit trying to go to heaven y'all y'all just quit trying to go to Heaven settle down quit trying to go to heaven CU it's going to be 2,000 years well you wouldn't call that much of a Preacher come on am I right well know what kind of a guy are you you you're you're a putter offer somewhere well that's what Paul was doing he's saying it can't come until they come a falling away well now if you can't can't see that in the past few years there has been a drastic Falling Away of the people of this message the 77 wasn't no problem there was a few churches sent their books back but now the preachers are jumping out of the message and trying to jump on some other bandwagon I guess but I don't think they're going to quit preaching all totally although I would admire some of them that did you know I was telling brother dickness we talking about a while ago I appreciate some of these preachers that's got enough gumption to just sit down and quit you know just get out quit trying to claim the message the problems is the ones that are sitting in it because if you're out of the message and gone you can't be the one Jesus spoke of that you stand in the door and won't go in and won't let nobody else go in right all right but see what have I been driving at for the longest recognizing your day in its message all right we've had the prophet's message we recognize that I hope we're not recognizing somebody else to come you know what I mean there's got to be somebody coming along straighten this thing out cuz brother around messed it all up I sure hope that's not what you're looking for if it is I'd go home and forget it but the thing of it is trying to get people to see things personal Luther recognized his day Wesley recognized his day Pentecost recognized their day brother random recognized his day when are we going to recognize the hour that we're living amen and to see that's Reon I'm trying to bring these things out like this well one of these days or one of these days we're going to go in the Rapture well how are you going to go in the Rapture if you had heard the shout that's right right now come on I know I'm hard but now you tell me the rest of the world's going into Rapture when we go into Rapture I'm going to tell you you ain't going because there's something wrong with your thinking right you mean just a bus is going to pull up and everybody's going to climb on you know this church over here is going to we're all going well that's what you're saying unless you're trying to see something personal related to you right that they can't see come on yes sir that's all I've tried to say something the world can't see and something the biggest portion of people this message can't even see oh yeah that make go woman going to get in the White House po come out of the United States well we ready to go now but listen church if the Rapture is a revelation then you and I have got to be at a the right place to get that Revelation that's right all right now to do that then I believe we must have the message that has been brought to us revealed unto us as to the amount that we have to have now we know that there's degrees and there's different things and all but still it's our part my little bitty part you know your your little toenail you know it it's just as valuable as your your uh brain because it's protecting your toe you know it's doing its part it was put there I don't want them taking Parts out of me just because they say I don't need them they would put there for some reason all right leave them alone home you know but think about it see then the Rapture is a revelation now listen to this thought and you'll get my point what if the Rapture is a revelation of his coming I give you a little time to think on that right what if the Rapture that we know that's already in process of the message that we've heard that's the shout and in that message is the voice of the archangel what if that Revelation is the coming of the Lord you know brother random made a statement I'll get to these way on down the road somewhere he talks about the seventh seal being his coming and about 1982 somewhere in in there I tried to preach those seals and when I come down to the end and bringing it down I said you know what people are looking for some great big something to happen but I said what if it is that it would be a message so simple until the people would miss it now brother Brown said if we don't get these minor things he said the major things is not coming all right now you know I what I've taught you that I believe if we don't follow the message how are we going to know where to look because it's this prophet's message right that is going to change us even the Jews talking listen to that Rabbi or not talking listen to Rabbi Richmond believe it was one or gersam Solomon they believe that Elijah will come and show them where to rebuild the Temple they're looking for the coming of Elijah to precede the Messiah what about it Church could we s be sitting in the greatest of event that has ever transpired in the world that would be the coming of the Lord and the going away of the church and knowing that a lot of that has already transpired but yeah we're looking for it you know we're trying to find it right and the Bible talks about stumbling at The Stumbling Stone you know how I illustr at that you got a football feel that there's not a rock in the whole place what is it 100 yards is at the distance and 50 yard wide orever what it is you know and all that grounded this green grass and right out in the middle of it Danny there's a rock and everybody on the place is looking for it and somebody just stumbles and fall so who tripped me don't even know he's the thing that he's looking for that's right that's right what about it Church you see how easy it would be to miss it thinking we're in it I remember making a statement back then that was so outstandingly simple CU everybody says I'm so deep and this that I wish you'd following this old brain one day but you know the statement I made back there the word come Co me go home look it up in your dictionary when you get home it means to be here to be here I said brother collie come to see me well it might be two weeks before he's coming I don't have anything to do with it I don't have anything to do with it once I've said it to him right am I just get ready for him to come in the house well if he's driving down the highway he's still not there oh there's brother collie he's 18 miles down the road I can see him but it's dumb right no it literally means not even to be in his presence it literally means like a husband and a wife becoming one and embracing wouldn't it be something you be overseas and be gone for two or three weeks and come back home you why say hi honey LED you home I mean I didn't expect a kiss anyway or she knows that I'm going to be there at 2:00 and she decides to go to town shopping well he knows where the house is he can get in all right you know when the Lord Jesus Jesus raised from the dead there was a very simple message went out he is risen very very simple message and for 2,000 years we've been trying to figure out all about that you know what it simply meant he's risen well what if the coming of the Lord is truly just the basis of him saying I'm here how simple can it be but yet we stumble all over it trying to find it see then if the Rapture is a revelation and the bride will be waiting for the revelation of the rapture what if that Revelation is so simple that it would be a message that he's here no no Rapture no no Rapture see there's your mind you still up in the clouds right I remember seeing a movie one time I know it's fictitional it was probably true because of the difference in doing it was when they first started testing the jet airplane and and the man run down the runway the pilot did and and he was so you know he was so fast compared to what he used to be till they said when he raised off the ground they said how are you doing he said my mind's still on the runway he said well that was dumb no it was just so fast the man told him said count to 10 he counted 10 he said he said I'm up now it's just a point of what I'm trying to get you to see the last few hours of Jesus hanging on the cross the biggest portion of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the last few hours amen and what are we looking for now let's just compare some things and think about it do you know that when the Lord Jesus was here on Earth he brought a message didn't he right shout brother R couldn't bring anything contrary to that so it had to be the same shout you know the voice of the Archangel was there cuz Lazarus was raised from the dead and Lady what was over nine I believe it is her son was raised in the dead many dead were raised why because he know he knew who he was he had no doubts of who he was Hallelujah that's it he could stand there and say destroy this body right in 3 days I'll raise it up confounded the world with his speech but remember he had a message was a shout and remember he was the voice of the Archangel and you know after he was raised he left a message a trumpet a gospel trumpet he is risen you see how simple it can be but but brother Dale you're talking about Rapture going away and coming coming down I've never talked about that I don't know where you getting that idea I'm talking about what's here now am I believe we've heard the message don't you we've at least got it in our our ability you know amen and in that message I believe is the voice of the Archangel because the prophet said I give it to you the other week that he'd become visible Among Us and rais the dead and we'd go into rapture and then the bride would be gathered by the trumpet but could it be that even the fact that brother brandom would say Jesus does all three you know that blinds most people you know why it blinds them cuz they think they got something to do with it they think some man on Earth has got something to do with it come on am I right when if Jesus does all three let's give him the honor and Glory right amen it wasn't brother Brand's message it was the message of the Lord Jesus Christ amen yeah but now you're not giv enough honor honor to what my honor goes to the Lord Jesus Christ yes yes sir amen now now let's go into a a thought about his coming you know that part of his coming is already ped come on try to compare the voice the shout The Voice try to compare it in your mind to what we're talking about part of the coming of the Lord is already passed and we're not talking about the coming cuz that's why I said it's going to take so long to bring it because see you got a coming to the Jews that's got to be dealt with you got to come into the world that's got to be dealt with but I'm not talking about none of those things until we get there okay we're talking about the coming of the Lord to you and I what about it what about when we get on over we'll jump way over now try to come back to it go over to number 10 brother Joe taken from Christ The Mystery of God revealed and look what he says paragraph 205 now the coming of the Lord is in mystery no mystery to it the Skies open up we hear a right well ain't no mystery to none of that he's coming well stage one of his coming is already transpired and we're in stage two of his coming just as the shouts already sounded of the Rapture and we're in stage two of the rapture comparing the second or the coming of the Lord and Joe changed that word instead of the second coming I put a title at the top put the coming of the Lord so it actually technically fit you know what I'm saying in there now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming I hope you got your windows rolled up we're getting some rain that we've been kneading thank God so was all the mysteries of God waiting for this life's day want you after he's already been completed then he reveals and shows what he's done well why are we looking out under somewhere When I Look to what taking place but he never gave his mystery in full but the coming of the Lord is a mystery the Rapture is a mystery but we already talk about the shout as the message that went forth right we talk about the voice of the Archangel but what about his coming go ahead to number 11 the angel of the Covenant preach in 1954 301 paragraph E6 but we'll be gone at that time yes sir there's a part of us that's Immortal no atam no hydrogen or nothing is needed for that are you listening what does that mean what part of us is Immortal that there's no atoms or no doings needed for that the soul of the individual that's born again right no hydrant or nothing needed for that it's we'll be caught up in a moment in the twinkle of an eye to meet the Lord in the hour watch there's three comings of the Lord now I just said a minute ago so I'll go back and say it now here we don't miss it I'm talking about bride I'm not talking about the world we got to deal with that when we get to that we got to talk about you know the End of Time Etc and then we got to talk about the coming of the Lord to the Jews right there's three comings of the Lord you know what there's three of everything in the scripture three is God's perfect number 3 7 12 24 40s 50s but three times he came once to redeem his bride that's already over that happened 2,000 years ago right wants to redeem his bride he comes the next time we meet him in the air to receive his bride he comes the next time in the Millennium with his bride that's after the wedding supper is over return back for the Millennium all right three comings with the Lord and one part of that is already over the coming to redeem is over with now you know what I mean it happened 2,000 years ago the process is still in and going just exactly like we talked about the shout that the people you know we say the shout well you know somebody come along and they just hear the message well that's just the beginning of the shout to them if they're not born again they're not even in the Rapture or nothing so you get born again the message becomes important that could be happening right now amen all right but look what he's getting to three comings of the Lord one to redeem his bride one to receive his bride the next time with his bride go ahead number 12 the Great coming revival and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit preaching 54 718a there will be three advents of the Lord Jesus the first to redeem his bride when he died for her second to receive his bride when he comes for her third with his bride for the Millennium and there will be three advents and one of the them is PED and the signposts are showing that we we're nearing the second Advent of the Lord Jesus we tried everything we've had all kind of big four meetings and you know man tried to go to Broken sister 1964 720 6 the evening see he makes three comings he come in three sons names he come in a trinity Father Son and Holy Ghost see all of it the same Christ the same God all the time now we know he come to bring three works of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost everything in God is completed in three and so he come first to redeem his bride he comes second as a Rapture to take away his bride he comes third with his bride king and queen after that's when many people are expecting the coming see a lot of people are expecting his coming but how you know the Jews are looking for the coming of the Messiah right am I right amen but that's done transpired and they missed it could it be that we could miss the coming of the Lord because we're not placing it together correctly number 14 which is the future home I just given these to make sure you would follow it Jesus comes three times come once to redeem his bride next time to get his bride next time with his bride so the coming of the Lord is divided into three parts or whatever you want to call it advents whatever the words you want to use it's divided okay now remember what he says on Christ is revealed look at number 15 and we'll be through with the Reading part 1965 822 the morning service paragraph 81 to dislocate the scriptures you might put his body together wrong the foot where the head should be or something just the same as other words you might have Jesus teaching Moses's message you might have or even Wesley teaching Luther's age you might have now our our age teaching Pentecost the Pentecostal message you see what a mess it would be Pentecost has already showed its colors Luther has already showed his went off in denominations it died right there the age took there it went now think about it if you looking at the scriptures and there's three comings of the Lord in the scripture one to redeem his bride two to take his bride away and three to come back to the Millennium now if you cross them scriptures up what are you doing you said boy that first coming of the Lord will be in that Millennial Reign you got your cow up in the tree because you're using words that are correct but misplacing them you got the Cal in the tree eating chist right that's right same with the Rapture right taking the scriptures and the things of the Rapture and applying this part of the Rapture over here and this part over here all right the Bible speaks that every I see him right that's one scripture of his coming but to the bride it's a secret coming one in the bed two in the bed one taken one left Secret two in the field one taken one left secret you see if we cross them scriptures up what have we got but yet we got the scriptures I give you the scripture I brother ever I see him well what do you mean well I mean just what the Bible say is there'll be a day whenever I'll see him we better not be it that day that's right we better not be standing out somewhere looking for it because that would have to be on over to the third phase stage whatever you want to call it of his coming cuz it can't be in our time because it's supposed to be a secret coming all right it definitely was not back there because all the world didn't see him you know they didn't have TV and internets and stuff like we got you know what did Brother around say1 to 1% he gave some small outstanding number of the people of the world today never even knew Jesus Christ was alive amen and he said then 1/10 and 1/10 of the Ten of that even followed him and then one10 of the 10 of that was the ones received him what about it church can we follow that the Rapture is in the process because the shout has already went forth then can we follow in the understanding to see that the coming of the Lord is in a process or whatever you want to call it you you put your words there don't have the education send me a note I'll change my letter to fit what you say but what about it what if we're taking scripture and looking for a certain coming and and and things to take place when that's not to us but that'll be to the Jews then you got what I just read there Jesus bringing John's message or Moses's message or whatever you're dislocating the scriptures and to do that look at the mass confusion you've caused bless God you can't tell me one day that Prophet I believe he said one day that ever I'll see him and the Bible said ever I'll see him you just better not be there whenever I sees him because the only way that could ever be is to be later at some event somewhere because every eye couldn't see him around the world today you know physically so you see what I'm doing trying to compare the coming of the Lord with the Rapture and see the Rapture as a process that's taking place and been taking place for a long time and that the coming of the Lord phase one stage one Advent one whatever you want to call it transpired 2,000 years ago it took 4,000 years for him to come right that's right look at all the scriptures we're going to have would have to cover if we covered it all You' have to read every scripture of the Old Testament you have to get into the Psalms where they pierced my hands and my feet you have to get into Isaiah where John is to come and introduce him you have to go into a virgin shall conceive what little bit I understand I could be preaching 20 years on his first part of his coming but what is being said about his him being here no he yeah yeah we believe that we we believe he come back to our brother de we agree with you one of these days well according to your prophet he s in three advents three stages three whatever coming first to redeem his bride second time to get his bride third time with his bride I don't think now listen carefully to the wording please I don't think we need to be as concerned about whether he came or not and we know the whole thing is involved around all around the fact that he did come or there wouldn't be nothing for us come on but I don't think it's a problem or should be a point of us looking forward to his coming someday why not get down to where we're at what good is a God that come back there what good is a God that's coming out you under according to the Burning Bush Moses said who are you he said I am that I am the prophet said that meant everpresent for eternity there's no future there is no past amen yes sir sure Moses could look at Abraham Isaac and Jacob you know he knew the story of them and sure he like everybody was looking for an end of the world and the Lord coming but he wanted something personal present tense that's what I want right now church more than anything in the world Amen and for God to speak to you and I then I ain't got to worry about nothing else sir I ain't got to worry about you leaving the church I can't run you off if God speaks to your heart I could get a whip and try to beat all of you to death if God spoke to you and you know I'm paraphrasing or right you people I start talking like that they get into oh what are you there ain't no way you can run the bride off you want me to quote the Prophet come on you can't run off the bride well are you saying everybody left you ain't bride ain't didn't say it then ain't saying it now that ain't none of my business that's between them and the Lord I'm only concerned with me and what's left in here run off Abraham's seed you can't why because they'll say I don't understand it you remember their disciples could have preached a little while about it you know 70 left over the fact of what this little word he said he just turned around to the 12 and said why don't you go to right what Peter say where can we go thou has the words of eternal life amen well never brother day you think here the only one got the words of Eternal I'm the only one I'm concerned about that's your business where you go and what you do is your business I'm concerned with one thing same 40 something years I've been preaching Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to try to get this church to see something personal in your own life am that's right yes sir and brother colie was coming back out I believe at South Carolina we went to a meeting we was talking coming down the road I said brother collie things get to going wrong down Atlanta I said get out cuz you can't stay in a big city with things going wrong but I said what could we do you know we were just talking I said brother collie all I'm trying to do is plant enough word into you if I don't never see you again right you'll be there that's my goal that's my thoughts that's to my kids my grandkids great grandkids my wife to everyone cuz we're not promised to be around here right but to the point of saying listen no matter what takes place you take what's been brought to you and move on well we'll just sit down and listen to brother Dale's tapes something happens to him I ain't never taught nothing like that go what good would it do you to listen to him a second time if you didn't hear it the first time you slept the first time what you going to do the second time you argued and fussed about what I said the first time what you going to do the second time you understand comparing the coming of the Lord to the Rapture or comparing the Rapture to the coming of the Lord and to see the things that people are looking for part of it is already taken place but yet if we're still in the blindness of lady oia we're still looking for something that's already transpired looking for a message to come when we don't have a message right looking for the Lord Jesus to come when he's already come come on if he's going to become visible Among Us and raise the dead and go into Rapture then we got to be somewhere in that voice of the Archangel part of the Rapture and somewhere in the second stage of the coming which is dealing with the bride coming to the word right coming to get his bride all right he said we don't I lost all my notes part of it I got it in here but you know it if you don't I'll find it for you Jesus don't set foot on Earth until the Millennium we meet him in the air so I'm not talking about a physical Corporal mortal whatever his words natural of the coming of the Lord but yet he'd be so visible Among Us what by Revelation you see church when I heard that the first time 40 something years ago the raptures Revelation and I heard him say that the bride be waiting for the Revelation I knew it was not just the fact that I had walked out of a Baptist Church and it accepted this message that automatically put me into everything because because this message revealed to me showed me I was not born again now how many of you will say it that way how many preachers would ever say that this message showed them they wern't born again that's right well what do you mean I had a preacher what do you mean brother de you come out you left that denomination you like brother Mo said you get your coat and hat and leave you know and you see them today they just keep changing houses and he getting another coat and hat another coat and hat right but you see he doesn't set foot on the earth until the Millennium we meet him in the air I wrote WR down word could give it but I can't be glad to find it oh okay go to number three brother Joe which is a sardan church age preached in 1960 1209 let me read this real quick let me tell you something the Bible says that when Jesus comes before he comes there would rise false prophets and there would be there would rise false jesuses that's right no here now remember when he says now nobody's going to call theirself Jesus you remember that he said people wouldn't have that so he's not meaning people rais up I'm Jesus I'm Jesus anointed ones right but let me just drop this into your heart there will never be a Jesus set a foot on Earth on this Earth until the church done raptured and gone now you just bear that in mind because there will be false Christ rise up now what's he connecting the two together for evidently their Doctrine is going to say that Jesus is coming physically right come on read now you just bear that in mind because there will be false Christ rise up but Jesus will never will not be here on Earth because the trumpet sounds and he never comes we meet him in the air the church is already gone and then when Jesus appears it'll be the returning back the Gentiles goes to meet him in the air is that scripture see they go to meet him in the air and then we go we go up and Jesus is never puts his foot on the earth until the church has been raptured and took home and the wedding suppers over in heaven then he returns back after the Jewish Remnant see while we're here doing that he's coming back to the Jews all right what's the other one what's the three comings what's the LI with the bride into the Millennium we will be here then in physical bodies and he will be here in that so why are we looking for some Corporal coming and if you'll check the things on these you'll hear one thing brother randam is saying he said people says as oil on their blood on their hand oil on their forehead he said they're saying the Corporal body of Jesus is here now that's false prophets what would happen in this message if you started somebody running around getting blood on their out of their hands and oil on their floor forehead some of you are diabetics and you prick your finger and you prick your finger now I'm I'm honest 90% of the time no blood comes out until you squeeze it right am I right I mean I'm giving you 10% now so all right I read back in some of the Pentecostal doings what they done was they put pins around their belt or somewhere and they would stick their fingers and then they start rubbing their hands and blood comes out that would mean the Corporal body's here if you getting blood and I don't think my blood nor your blood would be the blood type of the Lord Jesus Christ because he was not Jew nor Gentile he was God I'd want to analyze the blood and if I find yours in there I'm going to say stinking dirty blood but you see but brother Dale oh it's just wonderful to see these great manifestations what are you looking for when I hear these brothers preach and I just feel so good I Hear You Preach I feel down and out I'm grinning I don't know what you're doing you know the reason you're feeling down and out you're not thinking right because if what I preach to you tonight is the truth that the first phase of the Rapture has already transpired the shout the first phase of the coming of the Lord Lord has already transpired he came to redeem his bride why wouldn't you shout what about it folks could we be looking for something that had already passed could we be looking for the second phase of the Rapture as the voice of the Archangel and to come find out that he's been with us all this time and it is the part of his second coming to the bride is what the prophet said I'll give you the quote but I'm not going to read it he said in the bride coming of Christ now you remember the rest of that who wants to quote the rest of it for me coming out of the church you mean sister Gail the second coming of Christ is dealing with us coming out of the church that's evidently what he said he said in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church you know that we could be a whole lot further up the road than what we think we are well see people don't want to talk about that Brother Gary asked me one day brother Dale do you think we have the faith of the fathers I said yes didn't stop to think didn't Mumble and I wouldn't meaning everybody had it I wouldn't even mean it that I even had it I was meaning it was here Amen brother Dale do you believe we're in the voice of the Archangel I believe it you believe that we're in the rde coming to Christ I believe it well okay now I'll go along with you okay we we we'll try to find a happy meeting ground I don't want no happy meeting ground I ain't never ask nobody to compromise with me you stand on what you believe right and you're a hypocrite if you want follow the next do you believe that we've heard the trumpet you know shout voice Trump I thought we believe when we receive the new birth we were resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the only part that's physically in the earth down here is my body that's right the rest of me is already Heavenly you know by the new birth of course it's like it's always been your unbeliever what does he say if you have once you thought you had it wouldn't be no sick people in your church be glad to put a track record against any church you want to of what we've seen over the years you said that's sarcastic no it's trueth the Dead rais the sick heal Storms Come storms go away rain comes Rain Go Away pocketbooks stolen come back guns stole come back people healed at a word now listen I'm going to say this in I'm ending I waited a long time to be able to say just what I said cuz there was a time I couldn't say it because we didn't have the sick being healed we didn't have the dead rais we didn't have that thing sure we did we had it in degrees and points and thoughts and I waited but now I can say it and I can say it's not me it's been him the whole time right amen oh you're just trying to copy I brother around and be something think what you want to the Constitution gives you a right to think the Bible don't but the Constitution does all I ask is it true if it's true then I'm not bragging you see church I believe in a living God Amen oh how little and low I am what a garbage can I am but I believe in a in a living God I believe in a God that wants to live among us not to just talk about it and go to church you say yeah but they're sick among us well there can't be no third pull to speak the word for people that are all well what do you want me to do speak to get you sick he said you're dumb I agree with it I just brought your dumbness out so we both dumb you don't Pray For Rain Danny when the monsoon season you pray for it to quit but you see then I can still look at one thing and say not believe in me but you believe the word that has been brought and there's no sickness can stand in his way and you come up here and I pray for you and if you're not healed I don't say it's your unbelief I don't say like other preachers would say oh if you you know if you you if if you just believe me no I'm not I believe who was it father Divine was that him that told him he was going to walk on water and one of them men back there some of them and he invited the whole world and used media and walk on water downside the ocean they rolled this carpet right down to the water he was going to walk on water he took two or three steps and he stopped he said there's one unbeliever in this crowd and I can't do it you know who I think the unbeliever was don't you it was him he was right I don't blame you I go home and I cry and I said Lord come now and show you S as a living reality we've heard the word we're not the only group you know better than that you know I've taught you around the world the ministry of Jesus Christ is in the bride of Christ but we're not around the world come on musicians we're not around the world we're in Lula Georgia it's not worried about what somebody else is it's what we are whose fault is it mine then you know what then you must say it's yours when we get everybody up to certain certain place just like so and so is no you you don't got the wrong point no we never do that anyway when we all find our place in the body of Christ Christ can move on the scene but until that time let me keep hollering and screaming amen about a reality of a living God let's stand together what we got brother 604 in a spiral book 604 604 anybody have a need if we never [Music] again [Music] Earth and God we have been true and we've Liv above all then for us there will be a meeting going to be agreed I'll see you in the Rapture some sweet day I'll see you in the Rapture I'll see you in the Rapture see you at that meeting India now with th blessed savior live and forever what about it you have a need come let see if he's real one let me say that there's gone there going to come a day but all that looking out at something else cuz that's mankind writing a song or something to come I believe he's not coming e [Music] here we got to believe it we got to believe that he's here I'll see you that's our problem that's all he wants us to do I'll see you in the Rapture I'll see that me in [Music] the with our blessed rain forever I'll see you in the rapture some sweet [Music] day love [Music] him [Music] just how long would it take for God to work out what he's got to work out your Prophet said the biggest portion of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the last hours and maybe he said few hours or whatever but we know he wasn't on the cross that long right during the time that he was hanging on that cross the biggest portion of the [Music] prophecies about him was being fulf [Music] yeah but but but Brother D we ain't had no woman in the white [Music] house we a no pop out of the United States well what are you going to do sit around and wait come on folks I'm not throwing no stones at nobody I'm just trying to tell the truth I can read in the Bible that well there's going to be a falling away well I don't see no falling away so it can't come right now the Lord can't come because I believe before he comes every tub will sit on its own bottom you remember that one ain't even in the Bible can't tell the seasons except the shedding of the leaves the budding of the trees that ain't in the Bible right but we could be looking for something to take place and he just walk right Among Us and walk right off may I quote brother random only the bride is going into rapture only those filled with the Holy Ghost is going to go in the Rapture so that means there's a lot of people going to be left but you know what they're not going to believe that we're gone and my family I know what they oh they kind of crazy that say you know they up on them Mountain somewhere they trying to grow some wings to fly off with right you know the reason they believe those things CU there was people went up in the mountain and tried to grow wings to fly off with of good people they had it all figured out you know that when Jesus came a lot of the people wanted to believe him cuz they could see the signs and the Wonders but if they believed him it would have been excommunicated out of the church and because of that what about an illustration in the Bible you got a child and he's born [Music] blind and all at once one day his eyes come open well how'd that happen well this man named Jesus spit on the ground of which one it is now you can put them all together put a little Clay on the Man's eyes and he come forth you know what the mom and daddy said they faced faced excommunication out of the church right thought it doesn't been said anybody follows that and they said we don't know he's of age go ask him that's a good Mama and a daddy right really love that boy wouldn't take a stand and I like his answer paraphrasing it he said it like this he said whether this man be of God or not I don't know but said I can see and you have been around here all this time and I Stay blind whether he be of God I don't know but I can see hallah what about it church is time to open her eyes and the reality of life we ain't got that much time it wouldn't matter if we had 40 years 50 years
