[0:01] god bless you all
[0:04] brother white asked me to teach sunday
[0:05] school this morning to fill in for
[0:07] brother bob
[0:08] and i just want y'all to remember
[0:09] brother bob and his family sister
[0:11] monica's dad
[0:12] and everything just keep them in your
[0:14] prayers as they travel this weekend and
[0:16] any decisions they have to make you know
[0:18] it's a tough time they're going through
[0:19] i think right now i haven't heard any
[0:21] updates but you know just keep
[0:22] remembering them in your prayers
[0:25] if y'all can start that powerpoint back
[0:27] there brother
[0:28] anderson if you've ever heard me teach
[0:30] sunday school i pretty much always teach
[0:32] the same thing seek you first the
[0:33] kingdom of god and that's one thing
[0:35] that's near and dear to my heart it has
[0:37] been for for many years
[0:39] and i usually approach it from different
[0:41] angles but it's all more or less the
[0:42] same thing because i know as christians
[0:45] we can become kind of complacent
[0:48] and it's been on my mind for a lot of
[0:49] different reasons here lately that
[0:52] you know starting back into flying
[0:54] airplanes i got real rusty for all those
[0:56] years of not flying and it reminded me
[0:58] because i've been doing these working on
[1:00] these landings trying to perfect them
[1:03] there's never a perfect landing you're
[1:04] never done as a as a pilot trying to
[1:06] land a plane you're always trying to
[1:08] make these little course corrections i
[1:10] call them you know just little bitty
[1:11] adjustments
[1:12] and never stop fighting to get it just
[1:14] right
[1:15] same thing when you're driving a car any
[1:17] of you that drive cars you know you're
[1:18] always
[1:20] maybe
[1:20] subconsciously doing this if you when
[1:23] you leave today just watch your hands
[1:24] while you're driving down the road and
[1:25] see if you're not doing this you're
[1:26] always making these little course
[1:28] corrections trying to stay in the road
[1:30] and you just get so used to doing it you
[1:32] don't even realize you're doing it but
[1:34] you never stop trying to to do right and
[1:36] to stay in your lane you never stop
[1:38] trying to do right as a pilot and
[1:39] landing that plane right and as a
[1:41] christian we should never stop being
[1:44] seeking god every single day and
[1:47] making these sort of little course
[1:49] corrections along the way
[1:50] there's always more room for growth
[1:52] always more room for seeking more of god
[1:55] complacency is a killer
[1:57] that's something that that thought came
[1:59] to my mind here recently never become
[2:01] complacent
[2:05] so
[2:07] let's uh this lesson is about open
[2:09] channels and as you see here i've got
[2:10] this picture of a river and god is this
[2:14] eternal life this source of eternal life
[2:16] is never
[2:17] ceasing there's always more we can draw
[2:19] from him
[2:20] he's constantly flowing but we're the
[2:23] ones that cut off that flow of eternal
[2:25] life and those blessings he's so full of
[2:27] benefits brother richie douglas was
[2:29] preaching
[2:30] recently about the benefits of being a
[2:32] christian benefits of serving god
[2:34] there's so many benefits and that
[2:36] healing and salvation of course and
[2:37] eternal life but
[2:39] so many benefits that go just unending
[2:42] but if you don't seek god and then and
[2:45] don't keep those channels open
[2:47] the channels between you and god you can
[2:49] stop that flow brother wade preached
[2:51] recently i guess well it wasn't that
[2:53] recent
[2:54] about logs in the river you know that
[2:56] river will flow but if you get logs in
[2:58] the river it stops that flow
[3:01] so go to the next slide please
[3:03] so what i'm talking about in a nutshell
[3:05] is spending time with god that's brother
[3:07] bob's phrase for spending time with god
[3:09] it's anything you do
[3:10] in your private time with the lord
[3:13] and these are just some of the things
[3:15] that are
[3:16] that i use basically in my daily walk
[3:18] read the bible pray listen to and read
[3:20] sermons come to church fellowship
[3:21] meditate and worship and just curious in
[3:25] the back can y'all see all that
[3:28] pretty good okay this is my first time
[3:30] doing it up here so i didn't know if i
[3:31] needed to maybe next time make it bigger
[3:34] anything you do on your daily basis to
[3:36] spend time with god
[3:40] there are things in christianity that
[3:42] are automatic you know and then there
[3:44] are things that are not and this is one
[3:45] of those things that are not automatic
[3:48] you taking time out of your day is not
[3:51] automatic you make yourself do this this
[3:53] is something you have to if you want to
[3:55] say routine whatever just do it you set
[3:57] aside some time every day and spend time
[4:00] with god
[4:01] doing all of these things this is
[4:03] basically a format that i follow every
[4:05] every night when i drive the truck i
[4:06] start out listening to a sermon if i get
[4:08] tired i switch to gospel music i start
[4:10] praising the lord that's number six
[4:12] there worship i spend time in prayer and
[4:14] meditation thinking on these things
[4:17] the things we hear preached and all that
[4:21] and there's no substitute for eating our
[4:23] daily bread as a christian there's no
[4:25] substitute for that
[4:28] so brother brown talked about drinking
[4:30] and pushing out you know there's all
[4:31] these benefits of god but you have to
[4:33] drink in the word of god then you push
[4:35] out the healing and all the other things
[4:37] that you have need of in your journey
[4:42] all right
[4:43] next slide please
[4:45] so getting in the spirit i'm going to
[4:46] try to speed through these quotes
[4:48] because i don't have a whole lot of time
[4:49] and i've got a lot of notes
[4:52] you know stagnated water gets in the
[4:54] little wiggle tails in that's what's the
[4:55] matter with the church today a little
[4:57] wiggle tail little wiggle here a little
[4:58] wigger out there everything days and
[5:00] miracles have passed no such thing as
[5:02] divine healing can't sit still five
[5:03] minutes in a meeting oh my goodness
[5:05] stagnated water beaver dam
[5:08] blow it out amen there's a fountain
[5:09] filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's
[5:11] veins where sinners plunged beneath the
[5:12] flood lose all their guilty stain
[5:15] and next slide this is from
[5:18] the same sermon getting the spirit
[5:20] the prophet he's talking about the
[5:21] prophet elijah okay elisha the second
[5:23] kings three probably say get down there
[5:25] and dig
[5:26] all them logs out well i'll tell you
[5:28] then profit should we go back and have
[5:30] another mighty rushing wind nope should
[5:33] we start another ladder rain no no just
[5:35] clean out the channel that's all you
[5:36] have to do we got all the people just
[5:38] clean out the channel people's all right
[5:40] get the channel cleaned out so the holy
[5:41] spirit can come in all your fanaticisms
[5:43] and his and everything else in the
[5:44] church
[5:45] clean the thing out the rock's already
[5:47] smitten the waters are fresh running but
[5:49] the cleveland system has dammed up the
[5:50] stream the next time
[5:53] and i'm just trying to skip through this
[5:55] because i don't have the main quote i
[5:57] want to get to is the next one so not a
[5:58] new system we need we need clean the
[6:00] system we got get all the logs out of it
[6:03] there's differences the fussing things
[6:05] doing and things like that get away from
[6:06] them the water will go to flowing again
[6:09] they'll be love
[6:10] okay
[6:12] now this is a quote
[6:17] this is one that uh
[6:18] we play a lot for my for my girls for
[6:21] our girls uh we listen to it a lot at
[6:23] home it's i really love this tape if you
[6:25] get a chance to go back and listen to it
[6:26] come follow me
[6:28] and it's just so surreal to hear brother
[6:30] ben's tone of voice and it's just so
[6:31] quiet and you hear like fans or
[6:33] something right in the background it's
[6:34] just very very real i just love it and
[6:36] what he's talking about here
[6:38] is a really
[6:40] dear thing to me but there's one thing
[6:42] that you just don't inherit you've got
[6:44] to accept it that's eternal life
[6:47] and you only do that by following jesus
[6:49] by a born-again experience
[6:51] don't neglect
[6:53] that
[6:54] little story one time i heard of a man
[6:56] who was oh he was poor and he always
[6:58] wanted to it's a little fairy story like
[7:01] always stuck with me though and one day
[7:03] he picked a flower and the flower was
[7:05] magic
[7:07] and the flower answered to him and said
[7:08] you've been poor all your life he said
[7:10] now ask what you will and it'll be given
[7:12] to you
[7:15] it's like jesus said if you abide in me
[7:16] and my word about you ask what you will
[7:18] but how does that word get in us
[7:22] it's not some magic it's by daily
[7:24] reading the bible and praying and
[7:26] seeking the lord i don't know any other
[7:27] way
[7:28] he said that yonder's mountain would be
[7:30] opened up and i could go in there and
[7:31] find the gold in the mountain
[7:34] well he said you have to take me with
[7:37] you wherever you go
[7:39] i know that's really small that's gonna
[7:40] be hard to see i'm sorry about that
[7:43] you have to take me with you so wherever
[7:44] i am then you can ask what you will he
[7:47] walked to the mountain the mountain
[7:48] opened up and he went in the shells were
[7:50] full of gold and diamonds
[7:52] this is kind of like eternal life when
[7:54] you first come to eternal life there's
[7:55] this great mountain that just opens up
[7:57] to us it's great full of all these
[7:58] blessings of god they're speaking in
[8:00] tongues and
[8:01] good feelings and there's anointings of
[8:03] to do all kinds of things all this power
[8:06] and wonders and just signs wonderful
[8:08] miracles all these great things
[8:10] but the main thing is eternal life
[8:14] and he run and grabbed a great big gym
[8:16] and he said i must go and show this to
[8:18] my friends and now i'm a rich man i have
[8:19] everything now i must show this
[8:22] and so the flower spoke
[8:24] but said you forgot the main thing
[8:27] so he runs back and he picks it up says
[8:29] well maybe i'll get a piece of gold i'll
[8:30] pick up get a piece of silver and so he
[8:32] said i'll hurry out and tell the people
[8:34] how rich i am see what i've got
[8:38] and he got to the door and the flower
[8:40] said but you forgot the main thing
[8:43] so he runs back and he says and here we
[8:45] have all kinds of materials i'm gonna
[8:46] stop there for a second
[8:48] there are anointings of god to do these
[8:50] things and that is god okay i'm not
[8:52] condemning that and saying that's not of
[8:54] god speaking in tongues and all that but
[8:56] so many times people stop and build a
[8:58] denomination around that and say well
[9:00] i'm just going to set up shop right here
[9:01] this is a wonderful thing god's done i
[9:03] don't want to forget it so i'm going to
[9:04] build up kind of a fortress around this
[9:06] this is god this is all of god it's all
[9:08] over all there ever be of god that's
[9:10] where you're wrong because god keeps
[9:11] moving forward it keeps moving this
[9:13] fountain that just keeps flowing and you
[9:15] don't want to stop that
[9:18] and by the way too we live in an age of
[9:20] distractions this is a big problem this
[9:22] is a kind of a side note but all these
[9:24] distractions of just natural life of
[9:26] anything that gets between you and your
[9:28] time with the lord as a distraction
[9:31] and you just got to put that down for a
[9:33] while and say but you i got to remember
[9:35] the main thing this flower of eternal
[9:37] life the thing that started me in this
[9:38] journey in the first place when i came
[9:40] to eternal life just never stop that
[9:42] keep that growing keep that moving
[9:46] so he runs back and says in here we find
[9:47] all kinds of materials and he picks up a
[9:49] stone and he said i'll go take this and
[9:51] show the people what kind of a stone
[9:52] this mountain is made out of so i can
[9:54] find the way back to it and he started
[9:56] out the door and the flyer said for the
[9:57] final time you have forgot the main
[9:59] thing
[10:00] and he said oh shut up
[10:02] see he didn't want to hear anymore
[10:04] forgot the main things he ran out the
[10:06] door and he said the doors closed behind
[10:08] him the flower on the inside the man the
[10:10] main thing was the flower
[10:14] like peter said when he got on that
[10:15] mountain transfiguration and lord he saw
[10:17] the lord there and moses and elijah said
[10:19] let's build three tabernacles you know
[10:20] we want to kind of set up shop here you
[10:22] know build a denomination but no the
[10:25] main thing is the eternal life
[10:28] and then the next slide please same
[10:30] sermon just a little bit further down he
[10:32] was the transmitter he said he that
[10:33] heareth my word believeth on him that
[10:35] sent me has eternal life verily i say
[10:37] unto you he hears my word believeth on
[10:38] him that sent me hath eternal life now
[10:41] the word went from a transmitter said
[10:43] one day verily i say unto you if you say
[10:45] to this mountain be moved and don't
[10:46] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[10:48] said and come to pass you can have what
[10:50] you've said
[10:51] now if you just be the station to pick
[10:54] that up
[10:55] by some control on the inside faith and
[10:57] move right into the cycle of god the new
[10:59] birth and be born again then you'll
[11:00] always be in contact hear that voice i
[11:03] always warn you and the danger is alone
[11:05] when things are wrong things going wrong
[11:06] always be warning you and then instead
[11:08] of somebody being like that rich young
[11:09] boy or speaking of
[11:11] be like
[11:13] be man like apostle peter or paul
[11:15] somebody that wants the one souls for
[11:17] christ
[11:19] all right now brother branham also talks
[11:21] about open flues and the greatest battle
[11:23] ever fought
[11:24] and i'm still basically on the same
[11:26] subject it's just i'm so i'm just
[11:28] talking about these channels of daily
[11:29] bible reading prayer but i'm still you
[11:31] know it's it's similar to what brother
[11:33] branham is talking about because the our
[11:35] mind is a womb and we have to solve that
[11:37] word down it's a very natural thing so
[11:40] that the supernatural intake can take
[11:42] place it's just simply daily by reading
[11:44] prayer to sow down the word so there's
[11:46] something there for god to quicken okay
[11:49] i don't know how any other process that
[11:51] it can take place by unless you just
[11:53] really sew it down good in your field
[11:55] and make yourself ready and then god
[11:57] will come quick in it so god will heal
[12:00] you right in this atmosphere of the holy
[12:01] ghost where he has sent you
[12:03] god will give it to you just believe it
[12:05] amen open up them flues of the soul body
[12:07] senses conscience and let's
[12:09] let and just let god's word
[12:11] penetrate first take that mind
[12:15] okay
[12:15] there is the battleground not say well
[12:18] if i could feel it
[12:20] if i'd feel the glory of god falling
[12:22] over that's nothing to do with it not a
[12:23] thing
[12:25] but that is the glory of god i mean that
[12:27] is part of it that is actually god okay
[12:29] he's not saying that wasn't god doing
[12:31] that
[12:32] the anointings and all those things i
[12:33] love that i spend time like i said a
[12:35] while ago every time
[12:36] every night part of my what i do when i
[12:38] drive the truck is praise and worship
[12:40] god and i feel his presence comes so
[12:42] near i feel like i need to
[12:45] jump out of the truck you know i just
[12:47] don't feel like i'm deserved to be
[12:48] anywhere near him
[12:50] but that's part of it but that's not my
[12:52] new birth see that's not that's not my
[12:54] new birth that's part of my experience
[12:56] but that's not my new birth
[12:59] open that mind up that's the
[13:01] battleground there's where the battle
[13:02] sets in array
[13:04] right here on the front line
[13:06] your mind open it up and say every doubt
[13:08] i doubt my doubt say man i'm doubting my
[13:10] doubts i believe in god's word here i
[13:12] come saying something's going to take
[13:14] place then
[13:16] now
[13:17] matthew 7 these are scriptures y'all are
[13:18] real familiar with i'm sure i don't need
[13:20] to i'm just going to run through these
[13:22] ask and it shall be given to you seeking
[13:24] you shall find knock and it shall be
[13:25] opened unto you for everyone that asks
[13:27] you to receive and he that seeketh
[13:28] findeth to him that knocketh that shall
[13:30] be opened
[13:31] we're knocking at the door whenever
[13:33] we're praying and reading our bible and
[13:35] listening to sermons that's us knocking
[13:37] at the door
[13:38] and you know matthew 6 33 is what this
[13:40] all based on seek you first the kingdom
[13:42] of god and all these things we added
[13:44] unto you
[13:45] so next slide
[13:47] i'm just gonna take those six things
[13:48] that i mentioned earlier and just show
[13:50] y'all a quick scripture for each of
[13:52] these a couple of quotes and scriptures
[13:54] on these
[13:55] read the bible second timothy two
[13:57] studies show thyself approved
[13:59] a workman that needs not to be ashamed
[14:00] rightly dividing the word of truth
[14:03] and then pray
[14:05] pray without ceasing first thessalonians
[14:07] 5 1 timothy 2 i will therefore that men
[14:10] pray everywhere lifting up holy hands
[14:12] without wrath and doubting
[14:15] brother branham said in the prophet
[14:16] elisha you don't watch you let down your
[14:18] prayer life you say well i'm a christian
[14:19] that's all the more sign you ought to
[14:21] pray more than ever read the bible every
[14:23] day
[14:24] pray every day
[14:26] don't make any decision too harshly too
[14:28] quickly without first considering god
[14:29] about it i used to like this radio
[14:31] program i listened to years ago and it
[14:33] was a radio announcer i guess you could
[14:35] call him on there that his voice stuck
[14:37] with me over all the years it echoes
[14:39] through my mind
[14:40] every once in a while he says
[14:44] we all need our daily dose of the word
[14:46] of god does anybody know who that was
[14:49] brother louise
[14:51] on the eagle crowd radio man gave you so
[14:52] listen that has echoed all these years
[14:54] through my mind we all need our daily
[14:56] dose of the word of god i'll just think
[14:58] about that because i saw her at least
[14:59] back there
[15:01] but that's so true it it rings true and
[15:03] i'll always always remember that
[15:09] listen to and read the sermons that's
[15:11] the next one
[15:13] yeah romans 10 so then faith cometh by
[15:16] hearing and hearing by the word of god
[15:18] come to church and fellowship hebrews
[15:20] hebrews 10 and let us consider one
[15:22] another provoke unto love and to good
[15:24] works you know iron sharpens iron you
[15:26] know we need one another in fellowship
[15:28] constantly to kind of push each other
[15:30] and kind of encourage one another in the
[15:32] lord not forsaken assembling ourselves
[15:34] together as a man or some is exhorting
[15:36] one another and so much more as you see
[15:38] the day approaching
[15:42] okay making sure i'm not getting over on
[15:44] my time
[15:45] meditate philippians 4 this is my really
[15:47] my favorite scripture be careful and if
[15:50] you look up what that means in the
[15:51] original greek be careful careful means
[15:54] anxious okay anxiety we push out the
[15:56] anxiety that's one of those logs that
[15:57] gets in the river
[15:58] right before paul talks about this what
[16:01] i call the meditation scripture this is
[16:03] our format for meditation i think on
[16:05] these things and all the things in red
[16:08] there true honest just pure lovely good
[16:10] report virtue if there be any praise
[16:13] and think on these things
[16:15] he tells us basically get this log out
[16:17] of the way before you can do this before
[16:20] you can meditate on these things
[16:23] get that anxious log out of the way
[16:25] out of your river because it'll stop up
[16:27] the flow every time don't be so anxious
[16:28] no anxiety just no no fear just push all
[16:31] that out of the way and then you just
[16:32] sit and relax and just meditate on the
[16:34] things you've heard
[16:36] worship
[16:38] ephesians 5 and be not drunk with wine
[16:40] where in his excess but be filled with
[16:42] the spirit speaking to yourselves in
[16:44] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[16:45] singing and making melody in your heart
[16:47] to the lord
[16:48] even thanks always for the things unto
[16:50] god and father in the name of our lord
[16:52] jesus christ submitting yourselves one
[16:54] to another in the fear of god colossians
[16:56] 3 let the word of christ dwell in you
[16:59] richly in all wisdom teaching
[17:00] admonishing one another psalms and hymns
[17:02] and spiritual songs
[17:05] but and then psalm 22 but thou art holy
[17:08] oh thou that inhabit us the praises of
[17:10] israel one thing about it if you want
[17:12] god to come around you you start
[17:14] praising him
[17:15] and he'll come inhabit your praises he
[17:16] still does that
[17:20] across the mystery of god revealed
[17:23] and i don't know if i'm going to go all
[17:24] the way through this one or not
[17:27] what happened in the pre-figure now he
[17:30] opened adam's side and took part of his
[17:32] flesh which was adam to make eve
[17:34] the bride has to be the word for he is
[17:37] the word she cannot stand on crease she
[17:39] cannot stand a nomination she stands
[17:41] on she can't stand on good behavior she
[17:43] has to stand alone on the word
[17:45] she was a part of it she was taken from
[17:47] christ
[17:48] here's the part i want to get to that
[17:50] highlighted part outside of that you're
[17:52] lost don't care how good you are or what
[17:55] your relationship or what your
[17:56] fellowship is your organization you're
[17:58] lost outside of that word being in you
[18:01] if you abide in me and my word in you
[18:02] that's what you will and be given
[18:04] because you
[18:06] are the word are the same you and the
[18:07] word are the same next one
[18:10] okay
[18:14] all right go on to the next slide this
[18:16] one's um
[18:17] everybody's familiar with the story of
[18:19] titanic i'm just going to tell a couple
[18:21] little stories for illustration
[18:23] so
[18:24] i can't find where he said this but i
[18:26] know i've heard it on documentary once
[18:27] upon a time so i'm going to just
[18:28] paraphrase it before the titanic set
[18:31] sail you all know that this man this
[18:32] captain smith was a very uh
[18:35] he had a long a long
[18:38] career of
[18:39] sailing in ships you know and i think
[18:42] practically no accidents to speak of and
[18:45] i think he was quoted as saying
[18:47] something like basically
[18:49] my career has been uneventful i haven't
[18:50] had any major no sinkings no wrecks or
[18:53] anything
[18:55] so in his mind you know he had to be
[18:56] built up in pride a little bit haughty
[18:58] it sounded like the way he made these
[18:59] comments and
[19:01] he expected this last of his voyages i
[19:03] think it was supposed to be the one he
[19:04] was going to retire on and he expected
[19:07] it to be no no different you know just
[19:08] like all the rest is it's just flawless
[19:11] and not to mention all the pride
[19:13] surrounding that whole entire voyage
[19:15] everybody talking about that ship being
[19:17] the unsinkable titanic and then look
[19:19] what it did
[19:20] went out there to see and sunk and
[19:22] killed 1500 people i think
[19:25] so the point is pride goes before a fall
[19:28] complacency is a killer he was going out
[19:30] there to the sea with this mentality
[19:32] that everything's going to be just the
[19:34] same as it was before
[19:36] and me as the truck driver i've i've
[19:37] driven well over a million miles and for
[19:40] over the last 14 years and every night i
[19:42] still bound my head and pray and say
[19:44] lord give me trial and mercies and help
[19:46] me to concentrate and and pay close
[19:48] attention to where i'm going and what
[19:49] i'm doing and then i'm very thoughtful
[19:51] and careful and prayerful the whole
[19:53] night driving
[19:54] because i don't care how many trips i've
[19:56] had without incident or accident you
[19:58] know
[19:59] this could be the next one the very next
[20:00] trip could be the one where i kill
[20:02] somebody with that tractor trailer same
[20:04] thing with flying planes you're never
[20:06] really done
[20:07] i heard a pilot say this one time i
[20:09] don't care how many hundreds of hours
[20:10] you've got of safe flying this next
[20:12] flight could be your fatal flight you
[20:14] could make a wrong mistake and crash and
[20:17] you're playing is there another flight
[20:19] after that no that's it i'm not done
[20:21] though
[20:22] just have a story
[20:25] uh some of y'all know my dad passed away
[20:27] this time last year and i want to tell
[20:30] you all quickly about him
[20:32] that
[20:33] early on in his life hey first of all he
[20:35] went to columbia bible college in south
[20:38] carolina that's where he and my mom met
[20:40] and he was a real godly man really
[20:42] seeking god really loved the lord he
[20:44] played all these instruments and he used
[20:46] his talent for the lord
[20:48] and one of the things he did that was so
[20:50] striking to me this just goes to show
[20:52] you how close he was to god at one time
[20:54] that he would take his guitar out in the
[20:56] woods at that college campus and he
[20:58] would sing and play to the lord and he
[21:00] wanted god's guidance on who to marry
[21:03] and he had two women in mind one of them
[21:05] was my mom and then some other woman he
[21:07] had them wrote down on like a notepad
[21:09] and went out there at the woods to
[21:11] praise and worship the lord just
[21:13] hammering a guitar
[21:14] set that notepad down and he said now
[21:16] lord show me which one you want me to
[21:17] marry
[21:19] and the name that uh
[21:21] one of them was my mom deborah mccarthy
[21:24] and after a little while of him praising
[21:25] the lord then the sun shone down through
[21:27] the trees and lit on that name deborah
[21:29] mccarthy
[21:30] and here i am
[21:33] well years past
[21:36] my my mom and dad they always
[21:38] raise us up to serve the lord go to
[21:40] church we read the bible
[21:42] as a family we prayed together church
[21:44] every sunday as you know in the baptist
[21:45] church
[21:47] and when i was about 15 i went to my own
[21:48] baptist church my sister went to hers
[21:50] and my mom kept going to church but dad
[21:52] stopped going
[21:53] maybe he missed one sunday and then two
[21:55] then three and he finally became
[21:56] complacent and he just said i'm just not
[21:58] going to go and he quit on the church
[22:00] well over the next 20 years or so of his
[22:02] life i watched everything just fall
[22:04] apart his prayer life his i mean his you
[22:07] know spiritually emotionally
[22:08] relationally physically financially and
[22:09] every other way and at the end of his
[22:11] life i was worried about his salvation
[22:13] and i went to him and talked with him my
[22:15] sister talked with him my brother-in-law
[22:17] we all went in our own different ways
[22:18] and we had a dad called us together for
[22:20] a meeting and he wanted to know he said
[22:21] what do you all think of me spiritually
[22:23] now he basically came right out want to
[22:25] know about his spiritual condition he
[22:26] said do y'all think i'm job and i said
[22:28] dad i'm going to be real blunt job was a
[22:30] righteous man he was being tested god
[22:32] allowed him to be tested because he was
[22:34] a righteous man
[22:35] you've got away from the lord and i
[22:37] don't know after that exactly
[22:40] where that went with him and that was
[22:41] between him and the lord and i pray and
[22:43] hope that god got a hold of him there
[22:45] because
[22:46] october 25th my birthday last year he
[22:49] sent me a message and it was the last
[22:51] time and i
[22:52] i think it was a text and i didn't get
[22:54] back to him in time
[22:55] and from there on out he was incoherent
[22:57] and he passed away it was november 7th i
[23:00] believe he passed away
[23:01] but you know
[23:03] his whole life everybody's life tells a
[23:05] story you know everyone in the bible the
[23:07] kings you know there's some that say
[23:08] this king was good and kings and
[23:11] chronicles this one was good and things
[23:12] went well he prospered lived long and
[23:14] god blessed him and this one king came
[23:17] and he was an evil king and he died not
[23:18] being desired and he was stricken with a
[23:20] incurable disease and all those type of
[23:22] things if you will just keep seeking god
[23:24] never become complacent
[23:26] you know god will continue to fall
[23:28] pour out his blessings on you but just
[23:30] never stop never think you know enough
[23:32] and you've like brother white said
[23:33] recently i've got enough tenure in the
[23:35] message you've been here long enough
[23:36] that you just can sit back and relax
[23:39] if you've got breath in your lungs
[23:40] and you've still got time you still need
[23:42] to see god more
[23:44] you never stop seeking god
[23:46] and i guess i'll make one more closing
[23:47] comment
[23:48] um this occurred to me recently i've
[23:51] been thinking about this a lot i started
[23:52] reading my bible every day when i was 15
[23:54] in the baptist church i never missed a
[23:56] day of it in the last almost 22 years
[23:58] tomorrow makes 22 years or so since i
[24:00] started that
[24:02] it's no wonder
[24:03] that though i was struggling early in my
[24:05] christian journey with pornography and
[24:06] profanity
[24:08] it's ironic really to think about this
[24:10] but the law of god caused sanctification
[24:12] it already started working in me
[24:14] because at age 15 i started reading my
[24:16] bible every day and about six months
[24:18] later i overcame pornography about a
[24:20] year later overcame profanity my last
[24:23] bad word left my mouth and there's not
[24:25] been a relapse in over 20 years that's
[24:29] supernatural it's not
[24:30] suppressing that wasn't me suppressing
[24:33] it they have no more desire to do any of
[24:34] those things not a bit
[24:36] and
[24:37] it just goes to show you if you just
[24:39] follow this simple law of god i don't
[24:40] look down on anyone for you know
[24:42] pornography profanity smoking drinking
[24:44] cussing or anything but if you find
[24:46] those things in your life i guarantee it
[24:48] if you'll just read the bible pray every
[24:49] day never stop that eventually those
[24:52] things will go away you keep resisting
[24:54] the devil he'll flee but just keep this
[24:56] maintain this if you forget everything
[24:57] else maintain christ brother branham
[24:59] said if i whether i maintain my car my
[25:02] house my marriage or whatever let me
[25:04] maintain christ
[25:06] and that's gonna be it uh musicians come
[25:08] god bless y'all
[25:11] [Applause]
[25:15] you
