Revelation 3 14. in John 1 1 through 3. father we thank you we love you and we ask you to just do one thing for us this day and that is that you would just come on the scene because Without You on the scene here with us it's just it's just meaningless Gathering a waste of time and effort and all to come together but if for you come to end into our midst and to speak to our hearts and lives and touch each and every one of us then it's a wonderful thing we ask you to take away all of the hendrixes this day we know there's many sicknesses Among Us and father we thank you that you are the Healer and we believe you we commit everything to you it's just give energy strength and whatever is necessary for these old bodies because we're not worried about them we don't let them rule us we rule over them by the spirit of your loving grace and have your way now forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and bless us with your presence in Jesus name amen Revelation to your very familiar because this is the message to this age amen amen each Church age had a message all right but this church age has a very special message that was given unto us there's an Anna to the angel of the Church of the lady of Sia's right these sayings saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God then we go to John very familiar with all of us John 1 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to reading of the word now as I said at this age gets a special Revelation because it's the ending of all things and it gets the Revelation that we are to see almighty God come before us in our understanding by Revelation to be able to understand God and the way he does things and and all like that and thank God for the prophet who came to bring it because without that we wouldn't have anything anyway we would be just like all of the rest of the lady Lucia we would be out there playing with our minds and trying to do things and that's why we try our best to stay with what the prophet had to say and you know and doing it because that way we can we can at least say what he had to say about it but we know then that in our understanding because you know we still haven't left Heaven yet now so we've got a couple more messages so you know maybe two or three that we haven't left Heaven yet and we're going to try today to get into uh the things that happened in heaven and uh I'm trying to get you to see that heaven is real but I you know my point is one thing of every religion now listen of every religion of any form in the world there is a heaven or a place to go to right it doesn't matter what it is the only Indian had the Happy Hunting Ground the the Egyptians had these things it would carry them over into a falcon maybe would carry them through into another place and and things and they didn't believe that that man just died and was gone I'm just cool that's it well you're okay as long as you're alive but then you know why Mo you're gone that's why that even a an atheist would still want to look for a better place to live than besides what's here that's why I never have believed in atheists I believe in idiots but not atheists because you know if you believe that that there is no God then that makes you greater than the god that would be the creation of all things and see then that I just never believed it if I don't make no light of anybody because that's what everybody at least the Constitution allows us to believe what we want to believe now the Bible don't but the Constitution gives it to us so they can be what they want to and believe what they want to and everything like that just let me go on if I'm crazy let me just go on and be crazy you know and but I like what Paul said in the way that's called her if she was how he served God so that's what we're doing all right but now we believe in the the fact as I said this age gets the Revelation that he's the beginning of the creation of God all right and being the beginning of the creation of God is we'll get back to it a while in the quotes we know that the prophet said that makes a lot of people think that God created Jesus in other words and then Jesus created everything else he said making him lower than godhead and he said that's not correct that Jesus is almighty God or else he's the biggest deceiver that ever was okay amen but see being who he was he was able to condescend downward to reveal himself to us and that's what he's been trying to do he's been trying to to show himself to us by the creation you'll find it even in the Romans I gave these to Joseph he's not going to put them up Romans 1 and 20 that even the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see that we're without an excuse that's right man well I've never seen God will look on the blood of Christ amen you breathing aren't you okay I mean you're alive aren't you well then why would you say that you've never seen God right right see we're not we're not in the right channel like the old brother said you know the little kid that couldn't get an answer from the preacher in the Sunday school teacher and all you know he said nobody can see God no fella you know he went fishing with him he said son said all I've ever seen all my life is God it's according to where you're looking from what you're doing okay if we look correctly we can see God in everything of life amen all right but see we we want to hold it to you know God is a spirit and then we like to go with the scriptures you know no man has seen God you know well I thought the Bible said though that the only begotten or the father come to declare or bring him out into the open to where that we could see God and like just recruiting I were talking this morning see that's what I'm trying to get you to see about heaven and leave all of this junk we think this is real but where did it come from it had to come from somewhere so it came from heaven all right we'll get to that in a minute but like we're saying this morning then see we say well God is a spirit but see as long as we're down here in this dimensional realms we read that if God is a spirit in our interpretation of that is what no form no doings no nothing he just blows around goes here and goes ironing on just floating around just what was it before well I went back there he was just nobody knows because we wasn't back there you know you know well we wouldn't back 20 years ago too much either but that's still no point but see we get our mind all set but if we like if it's true what we've been studying of Dimensions that that there's another dimension called the fourth dimension looks just right here with us with TV going right through here right now hey it's in another dimension it's what's something we can't see and we were talking last night Einstein said you could pass one object through the other object in the fourth dimension and and never make a hole in it he could see that he said run around shut up we should have been there when he spoke on his finite universe wait and things that he could see like Aaron was talking about see then Einstein proved that there was something pushing I mean he could prove that we thought no it's just nothing it's just no Force no nothing just floating around but Einstein could prove that there was something pushing he knew more than we would think about you know about it and I'm trying to get you to see that heaven is real right amen amen well in the dimension of Heaven as we call it which is not a dimension we went through that there's only seven dimensions the eighth would be Heaven which is not a dimension because the dimension signifies a a an area a space or something captivating it right and she whereas eternity would have to go beyond that to where there'd be no beginning and no ending to it and and then what if you were living there then the word Spirit would have a whole lot different meaning to it than I were experienced and we deal with Spooks we're afraid you know we see something you know you know a lot of it's our mind but it's real some of it is but get to point now we're trying to get to it see because even the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things we've seen we see out here at night see we see father we see something we see human we see there's that in the other so we can comprehend God all right now we read in the said in Revelations 3 14 that he was the beginning of the creation of God all right then it cannot be that God created Jesus and Jesus created something else that would make him lower than godhead right all right so he has to be the same one moving over in another form the Son of God had to be God in another form to create all right so then now we're getting to the scriptures or where it says and in Hebrews 1 and 2 this by whom he made the world who's he talking about Jesus Christ now not Jesus the body right see that's where we connect to uh the reason I use Jesus Christ is because when I say Jesus Christ I mean almighty God now when I say Jesus I know how to say flesh right right I know how to say flesh you know what you're talking about but I'm talking about Jesus Christ I like it in Ephesians 3 and 9 where all things were created by Jesus Christ so what's your problem with the scriptures well if you just leave Jesus out of it see then you don't know what I'm talking about get a revelation pray for God and reveal it when I say Jesus Christ I'm talking about almighty God Amen not a second person or a daughter an idea or a concept and right there with you Colossians 1 and 16 says we're by him were all things create anything all right why can't we believe the scriptures see and like I told you there in John 1 where it said in the beginning was the word word was with God see will you we don't use that word with it's not somebody's name beside of somebody why well that's her word I know it but we need a revelation we need a revelation more than anything so pray for a revelation all right now let's get down into something because I said we're still up in heaven now we haven't descended there's no World created there's no atmospheres there's no nothing we're still in heaven we've been there for how many minutes I don't know how many but we've got a couple more to go because we if we get to it this evening we want to talk about Sin originated in heaven now I want to ask you a simple question how can sin originate in heaven when if God is sees it the instant the prophet said in the presence of God he said one sin and you're gone you agree that's right you believe he said no fine just one Split Second well how is it that that could happen maybe God did have a plan and a purpose but when we might find out what sin is we might find out why you're a prophet kept saying sin is not drinking gambling smoking running around with wind you know when the lady finally said brother around I'm quite interested he said it's unbelief right right the disbelief God's word can be so simple until it we may find out that we're still in it all right now but let's talk about the creation because we're only going to be dealing today and this morning with the creation of angels we're going to run around City first made Angels no worship all right so now don't get on to anything else of creation just leave it where we're at hold it till we can get if I do at the end of it we'll try to drop down a little bit but stay with me because see I'm trying my best to get you not to see how smart I am or how much I can read or how much is going on if that's what you think you're in unbelief I ain't gonna back off that word it's your sin if you're unbelief because I'm not going to disbelieve you if you tell me God speaks to you and you can show me the word I'm not going to believe disbeliever don't donkey it told the truth that's right me so where do we get away from that to get down to it but a creation the word creation according to Webster is the act of creating the act of producing are causing to exist the word creation all right now to create well let's finish on creation a thing that is or has been created it can even be an original product of your mind huh now the word create is the cause to come into being as something what's unique that would not naturally evolve or that is not made by ordering by an ordinary process all right you understand this it's it's not something that that is a unique and something just happened is not the pollywog that fell over this way you laid so long then you fought back over this way you know who made the pollywog all right solves a problem but see we don't think those things see it's not just some ordinary process to create this to evolve from a person's own thought or imagination to create is to come from somebody's thought or imagination all right now we know that God cannot change his mind so his first thought about the creation would have to be perfect right because it was a thought from his mind all right now in your Strong's Concordance creation is uh 29 37 which is means creature it means creation it means to build it means the act of founding you know or establishing it means to build it means to bring in to being all right now so let's stay up in heaven and let's start off with some things that your Prophet said and you say well you just confused me by talking about heaven being real well now I'll remind you of what I said to start with the old man didn't have a half a hunting ground you know that's right everybody's got a place you want to go to I never have understood this one about the Atlantic see what that's their business that you know the guy goes there and he gets the guys in the morning it said diversions I never have figured out what the woman got because a lot of them dying now but that's just the point they still believe in a place to go everybody believes in a place to go somewhere once you leave here and you know there is a place to go to we're either going to enter the dimensions of the Lost are we going into the dimensions of them saved as we call it so we're going somewhere because the soul of man because only God can destroy the soul you can blow this body to Pieces but only God can destroy the soul all right now stay with me then as we're talking about in heaven well brother Dale you've never been there but now we've we've got some people that have been there now Paul said he was taken up to the third heaven right right and said he saw things it was not lawful to be said right but why can't we believe of a heaven now listen listen to this amen before you come into this message you believe what mama daddy preacher so and so so and so you read this that the other you believed in heaven why did you get in this message and quit believing in it what you've done you quit believing in it and everything because you're trying to give everything rationalized and bringing it down oh my brother daily comes right down here amen where does it come from okay where does the future home come from Heaven that's right that's right where's it being prepared for us in heaven well why can't we believe in a beautiful wonderful situation of looking at at Heaven as to be you know just Rolling Hills and wonderful things and trees and and Gardens and and all of the things see we're going to get out of a lot of quotes we were talking about some of them last night brother brother said one day he said Jesus will lead us up you gonna take one and he said we'll get down and say papa God why can't we believe that heaven is real she wanted the message hasn't taken that out of us but the preachers have they preached out of us some things that we did how that was truth that old brother died wanted to take some gold with him and said and she would just make it a joke I don't like that kind of joking I don't think that's right you know what they're saying well now he just wanted to take payment up there you know put down on the ground well why what's wrong with your mentality why would we want to even comprehend that the most beautiful I'll read to you later when we get on down in it the most beautiful places in the world that you could think of you just remember that ain't even a negative Harley as comparison to what heaven really is you showed me in the Bible where Heaven has ever done away oh but I got your scripture we've done been through it too the Bible said Heaven and Earth will pass away well did Heaven's going to pass away then Earth's going to pass away the same way so you better back off and brother Reynolds said the first Heaven is a millennium see we better back up and start listening and not get into the place listen to brother Branham sometimes when he talks about it is he making a light or is it a uh see well oh that's in the future home where he says that I want this little cabin down in the corner is it in the future home purged in heaven I can't get a quote there the other day and I'll give it back to you at the end of this where brother random on things that are to be which is 65 and future home was preached in 64 and brought around him in 65 is talking about a heaven on things that are to be and he said Heaven is a real place he said just like this is real he said we're going back to work don't you know what do you mean we're gonna work no we're gonna do what we want to do but see that's 1965. a year later he's still talking about going into heaven don't you think he'd want to go for a policy deterred don't you want to go see what we think well then what we're doing is we're just trying to be intellectual now I'm trying to bring it down to to tie it together with things here to where we could see it I'm not talking about this that God is real I mean that there's a God I'm talking about God being real I'm not talking about heaven it's just a place I'm talking about heaven being real I'm talking about the where we came from with heaven we'll get to it eventually we'll run around and see it what did he say he said that the seeds on this Earth was from another civilization a lot of people in the message believe that there was other worlds created there was other things created there was other people created I mean even in the message people if there was more people created than Adam and Eve but I got one scripture for you because the Bible said he's the mother of all living so you better back off right so that's what I'm saying I just want the Bible all right but what's your problem If Heaven has trees and grass and all kind of beautiful roses and and things like that and fire Gardens well why couldn't God when he created this world just reach down and get a handful of seed and sprinkle it on the earth when he created it where it becoming from that Civilization all right that's right right right not a bunch of monkeys climbing up in the tree somewheres after another planet not extraterrestrial beings I have enough trouble with the ones on Earth all right never run into one of them out there and like I told them last night we're talking about it sure is odd how that these people get picked up by these things and I'm not saying something don't happen which you know they can always talk to him you know I never thought of that oh there's so much Superior I thought I wrote around and said the Son of God had more at the market than even an angel where's our scriptures and what we're doing but listen I like the way brother random talks look at number one on your nose which is taken from I mean you would have with someone who's free but we're trying to save and cut back a little because you're gonna have your hand trying to read and up on your reading it appreciate brother Joe when and Richard and them doing it they said it's gonna get involved in a Brother Anderson all to get involved in this we got enough computer guys to to handle the things and they could take your time about but look what brother Randall said on a message called who is this Melchizedek in 1965 221 the evening service I you recalled I just gave it to you because he's talking about the thoughts the attributes and the things of being expressed all right and secondly he become the word Saint John the first chapter in the first verse noticed is in the beginning but before the eternal now your mind there is no way to comprehend what that Prophet has just said right we are gradually beginning to understand the word Eternal but we can't know really know it but we've used it so long until it's become a part of us um at the grace she could stand up back there and she could say pneumonia now she's four years old if you can't spell it she don't know what it is to her it might be a guitar or a horse to ride and I never have figured out how they started off with a p I won't start it off with an end if it's pneumonia um you understand yes we can do a lot of yaka Yaki from cause we've been trained all of our Lives we've been trained and told these things well then it's hard to get away from what mama told us mama told us that hell was eternal it's hard to get away from that right mama told I'm not doing it for Mama I'm just using that Daddy what are you going to do on a claims what but they told us that they were three gods but nobody now son understands you've got to know that we're talking about something special but this is just what I see that is God in three persons Blessed Trinity ain't no problem the Lord not in me in the English language not being any language in the world but yet you go down and talk to somebody and they'll start telling you about the they'll start telling you if we believe the end of the world is here and you just mentioned a few words and say something about God nobody don't understand according to the Bible that says the Eternal godhead could be understood by the things we see where are we at well what's he saying in the beginning but before the Eternal notice in the beginning was the word when the time began it was word all right but before it was word it was attribute or thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting where Melchizedek is that's the mysterious person in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us hold that that point there he is being with Spirit see okay spirit God Supernatural all right the great Eternal second he began to form himself toward flesh in the theophany it's called the word a body this then is the same state he was in when he met Abraham when it was called Melchizedek he was in the form of theophany now we get to that and prove it but see what's my point we say in the beginning was the word now remember brother Brown was saying in the beginning before the eternal but there was never a Time if the word is eternal there was never a time that the word didn't exist if it didn't did not exist and came into being it's some secondary right simple it would be a different God so it was never a time that he wasn't the word there was never a time that he wasn't father son the Holy Ghost and all the attributes he or savior where did he get them from what is that no no when you got here it just like that but you see we think we understand we think we've got it figured out after the prophet has said all of this so long we think we've got it figured out but remember he said in the beginning but before the Eternal right so there's a lot to the beginning to be considered a lot of things that we've got to comprehend to be able to understand so then let's lay aside our thoughts except God's word and believe it and pray for a revelation I thought that's what we needed right amen all right so then what is it then was there ever a time that God didn't exist he wasn't God now you don't understand he wasn't God because God is an object to worship you mean he wasn't God you ever noticed brother random could be able to quote this picture and he'd say in the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the Earth right not not that that dog brother Dale it wasn't out of him it was logos see we think we've got it all going run around could get over to John 1 1. you say in the beginning Elohim was with Elohim and Elohim was Elohim and then Elohim was made flesh and dwell Among Us you know what he's still Elohim he's just not existing alone he's the same I want him that exists existed along but now you're just with his people so he receives more under more titles that's why you get in Genesis he begins to call him Lord God Jehovah Elohim one of the causes signifying the father with his family right but he's already started creating you see when we say no you you don't understand he's not God see that's what we get all tied up and think we know there was never a time that he was from God there was never a time that he wasn't a father there was never a time that he wasn't a Healer now can't be causing nothing sick that's a display right a lot of difference between what you are in a display that's right I mean my kids are a display right but what do we understand what do we understand look at the next one Christ's mystery God reveal 1963. 728. paragraph 102 103 104. may God's Great secret he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind I like that how about a prophet that could go into the back part of God's mind but now he tells us what's back there why can't we as peanut brain the idiots understand what he said about what was back there but back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it what's his motive in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a Moon Star at a molecule or anything he was God now see but he actually wasn't God at that time because God is an object divert worship and there wasn't nothing to worship Him what does it mean he wasn't God maybe there's nothing to worship so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and then him would love and him was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be a savior and him was to be a Healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God again would you see there wasn't displayed if you add an attribute to god what have you done he never gained attributes coming this way he displayed attributes coming this way that's why if we all if we have eternal life the eternal life we have would always love eternal there was a time we didn't have it we had to receive it here but as far as God is concerned it always was eternal because it's his own life amen all right short of my opinion listen the first thing he made was angels and then they worshiped him and that made him God then he started from there as in previous message and I've tried to explain it break it down now then when Angels begin to worship Him and watch that was before there was even a molecule in the Earth now where were the Angels created all right are we reading it that was before there were before there was even a molecule in the Earth there was nothing it was all Darkness there wasn't no sun nor no moon no stars no nothing then he was God and he asked job where were you when I laid the foundation of the world and when he started saying together the sons of God shouted before that was way back before the Earth so his first creation was angels and then we'll get to it in the next message where his first creation is himself you say well how could God be created when God's God well that's what your Prophet said he said God's first creation was God himself so what's he saying he's saying the Eternal God that can in no way be comprehended is going to condescend into another form right the word that we can begin to even comprehend anything whatsoever about the self-existing one he's going to bring it down he's going to come down but now remember the first thing he created was angels that was in heaven before the Earth Moon Stars etc etc we just read it off the quote ever come into being so his first Creation With Angels see we look at our angels and we saw yeah what are you doing he created this he's got these fluffing wings and we flop over here and we flock over there we flop all around you know and then now you go down to buy you a uh Christmas scene you know with the baby Jesus and you'll find that unless you've got to find her something original or something part you'll find that they've got a little angel sitting in there and you know who that is that's Gloria a female angel right see because they're getting that in your mind I ain't no women angel I saw one I played with one when I was a little kid it was in my little T-shirt party Gloria and when I get there I want to talk to delivery you say silliness that's not silliness I'm telling it like it is you know that we're trained in our mind the way mankind wants us to be trained right come on you're serious about it okay in the beginning before the eternal let's go down to that one man so we got we got it in this nation let's go on down to number three I got 21 1953 729 questions and answers on Genesis and watch it if God created man in his own image and his own Emmy on likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man that's right okay God's just a spirit but we're just the spirit I thought their Spirit man went into the garden and control the animals come on what was your spirit they which race it is now if you'll notice after he'd made all the creation and created Spirit man because reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find this that God gave Dominion to the of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in his making of dire he made man in his own image to lead the cattle lead the Beast to the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today but in his making of their you don't fall and Reb run around you just read over it read very carefully dissect every word he was in other words Adam the first man in the Lord creation of God the first creation was God himself now hold on don't say that slow guys let's read the rest of the wording read it right off the screen no what'd you say he was in other words Adam the first man and Lord creation of God the first creation was God himself then out of God came to logos which was the son of God then out of the law gosh which was the word in the beginning which the word and words with God the word was gone and the words would make flesh and dwell Among Us out of the little guys came forth the man bring him on down but look at it read it how can God be created see because our word creation is to take something and make something right right you take metal you make a car you take wood you make a house so then we look at what well what do you mean brother Dale because that would mean God was was was back dire and and and how could he be a creation we'll go talk to the prophet you say you believe we'll get to that this afternoon let's see if we believe I'll run around said you know we don't believe all brother Brown said you know what that is s-i-n but you confused me I just don't understand no I didn't confuse you you're more than confused so don't blame me all right we were all born confused we've all been trained confused we've all been taught confusion God is trying to get that out of us right you mean you're talking about a Rapture but you don't know where you're going to work on hyper Rapture when he said but I guess we play hard when we get on because you know the old mythology sword Dukes you know whatever they're rolling the ball involved and that's what thunder and lightning is you know the old mythologies when they roll the bowling ball it hits the pin that's the underlying it are we still in mythology are we talking about revelation I don't like you and your attitude please God pray for my attitude but what does the word say all right I don't like your attitude either so we don't love each other that way we love each other's Brothers and Sisters in Christ right right you see because you know brother Dale is one thing he's gonna do it he's going to tell you I can hear they're gonna quote brother random ly you said which if you don't quote all it bring it to me bring it to me that's the internet worldwide anywhere send it to me that I'm not saying what wrote around them says because this is time to quit playing these little sugar tits and and be kind to everybody and nice all right I love to be nice but I know what my father is trying his best to do if we're going to that set in a Rapture where are we going well I really don't know I don't really care I just want to go well why run around and spend all the time telling us about the places we could go to I think we could take 100 million year trip and just walk through the portals and the beautiful places you know so we use our flimsy excuses how is God a creation all you can say out of that is one thing what God Almighty you should call it spirit begin to condescend what other word can I use downwardly to where that the human being could eventually have some idea about God now so we're back where we started that so his first creation is angels whose first creation is angels what is an angel wings and then Gloria's got her wings no there ain't no such thing as male or female angels they're all into the masculine form of looking but they have no masculinity you understand the words without being blunt they have no reproductive systems they have no things to be done because it wasn't made that away but they are real wormwood destroyed the world with water you remember about a random like countdown to the different things wormwood come up for and they was down to three who grew children were down there in the furry furnaces and look I'll watch this thing off one time letting me loose is that fire I ain't gonna bother him let her just turned me loose the angels are real now they are not human they have no gender to the point of they look masculine because they're into the image of the God who was creating them you agree so when he created them right around showing an angel walk in the room with him he didn't have wings right would you say that's what we were like well brother they don't understand they'd rather have wings to do because brother Brown saw them going up top to her and they were swings yeah because that's the way they were showing they're saying the angel of the Lord came down and talked to a man and a woman one day right not with wings a man and the Bible said he doesn't marvelous works because he went right into the fire and went right back out angels are real yes now we know that brother Brown will give you and why he says I don't understand and I never have understood it but I'll give you I quote it with you brother Randall will automatically 99 of the time say that two-thirds of the Angels accepted Satan's lie and failed the Bible says one-third now while he said that that's no big it's just to me I'm an entrepreneur I'm just telling you this sir because somebody come along and say well I didn't see that no I don't think he was changing the Bible but what was the purpose according to the scriptures or the creation of angels the Bible calls a ministering spirits made for what purpose why do the Angels come into being back there well they come into being to worship Him is that all they have the Bible says there are ministering Spirits right to minister to the hours of salvation run around and said ever Born Again believer has an angel you see but what does it matter see we get so caught up into two thirds or one-thirds until we we lose the whole thing we'll run around must not have been a prophet because he contrary to the Bible because it says one one third and he said two-thirds yeah according to Matthew Martin Luke and John there were two Blind Men in one place and one blind man another place are you saying they got naturally confused no it's not what they saw they wrote what they saw what do you understand what I'm getting at angels are real they're in another dimension right right and they're real all right we'll get to this later the ones who fail do not minister to the hours of righteousness they pervert our nature amen said and he even says that they come and take up on themselves human but you better read on because he said we don't believe in that doctrine that the Angels created bodies and stepped into them so there's a lot right around the stairs that we need to sit down and just think a minute and ask the Holy Spirit to tell us amen so what was his first creation well then before there was any world before there was any molecules before there were any atoms before anything so it must have been up in heaven and how long were they there because there's no record of time whether it be two seconds or 10 trillion trillion trillion trillion three trillion years it wouldn't make no difference they was there right and they worshiped God borders on the evening message so I'll just say a few words see then Satan got exalted little brown said he got jealous now let's back up God's first creation is God himself meaning simply he's trying to condescend word then the second form of God that we see because we don't believe in trinitarianism we believe in God in another form would be coming down to the low gospel need the Son of God in another form now according to the Bible that we've just read and you I hope you don't need all right around would have to say about it that Jesus Christ created all things and Jesus Christ is the son of God I said Jesus Christ not flesh that's why when he stood on the earth what did Peter say Thy Art the Christ when you get over into Luke it's a dark the Christ of God gave me another God there's God in another form all right who created the angels God in another form called the word he simply said let there be an angels appeared for millions of years those angels could worship him in the beauties of Heaven no Darkness we just read what your Prophet said no nothing no molecules no nothing we're still up in eternity in heaven we got to stay up there until sin originates and then it gets kicked out but you see Jesus Christ was that word that began to create as your Prophet would tell you on questions and answers on Genesis if you listen to that tape he said then we see him he said like a little Halo of light comes out he said what is that he said that's God in another form called word that he begins to create and as you begin to create the first thing he created was angels now who was that that created angels why did Satan get upset with him remember when Satan then he was the anointed Europe stood right beside the Lord he was God's right-hand man the only thing that was kept from him was creation right I'm calling him right around him you know that's true the only thing that was kept from Lucifer was creation he could pass out Supernatural gifts you could do all kind of signs and wonders that's what your Prophet is saying but he can't create it took him no telling how long to be able to see those angels but he finally deceived at least we know a third of them I have to ask the people last night because these were a lot of questions they were asking how is it that God would not see what Lucifer was doing don't you think his omniscience would let him know don't you know that when he created the angels and he created Lucifer don't you know that when he created him he knew what he would do but still sin in the presence of God that's why we can't do it now there's got to be a bump of blood sin in the presence of God one second he'd annihilate us I don't care how goody goody You Think You Are we're still sinners now so why can't Lucifer and the angels That Got Away into this and if it was billions of years and they just went out and they they began to form little groups and little clicks and little things kind of like a church sometimes you know little click little groups and little things and then they just I'll get back to seeing into that more on sin but you know but one day it finally come to a place that God wouldn't stand it no longer so he cast him out and who cast him out right which is Christ right The Book of Revelations 12 we'll get back to you that just laying the little things into your mind for this afternoon see then what killed in other words you understand what I mean he understands God and the Earth the annuals he knows what you're doing but what if he went over and said all that except that liar dead it would have been done right so now you can do what you want to do with my carnalities and my way of looking thing but some way God turned his mind right he turned away right now I'm talking about all Mighty self-existing because he had one standing there in another form right that could protect him amen you know that Michael kept them from being destroyed right right when Adam and Eve had sinned and God the Bible says came down every day and walked in the midst of the garden is that right and Eve committed sin and how long it was five minutes whatever it was she took it to Adam and Adam took the sin what kept her from being destroyed why would he be that God would come down and run around and see us and say Adam Adam where are them now don't you know that he known but that's not part of the story that's right it the part of the story they had to be a fall to do that God had to turn his way turn away from him and allow this to build to a certain place and then when it did Michael says that's it now I never have believed in fighting in heaven now you can believe all you want to in all your karates and all of this that and the other I don't believe it I believe one day Michael called the ground and he said hold it let's succeed you wouldn't say even on a joke no more room for you here now remember we read a quote that brother Branham said the angels and things were created before anything come into Egypt he said it was Darkness now there's no darkness in heaven so we must have been talking about some more than that but he said it was Darkness so that's what Michael said to Outer Northwest he couldn't fight him you can't do it now you remember in the Book of Daniel before Gabriel could come to Daniel Michael had to come to the aid of Gabriel and Gabriel is a great Angel Arc the Archangel that delivers the messages of the coming Messiah Etc all of that but he wasn't no match for the devil but Michael came to his Aid I love what it said it says you're a prince Michael came okay and stopped it Gabriel could come on to Daniel that's right see we're not out of the Bible we're giving illustrations and doing things but we'll pick that one up right there this afternoon but let's back up there now let's back up to where and we get back to the creation of the Angels and we see that they could worship Him and there was a wonderful thing those angels were busying themselves all over heaven performing chores do anything well what kind of chores would need to be done I don't know The Profit was going to work when we get there yeah but I I believe in his own way we didn't work so you're lazy sorry the Dale's too blind I know you just flat lazy now that's why you want to go to a place somewhere to lay up let some angels feed and she was because it's exposing you and me like I told the doctor the other day I said listen doctor he said Sam said we're running these tests I said let me tell you something I said you're gaining ground getting to the place and I said this is only about that Satan has been able to conquer me in the flesh when I'm getting over it but I said you're gonna get ground one of these days and you'll know what I'm talking about I said I'm 70 years old I said if I sit down I will draw up and die listen no sorry I will keep going and all the energy I've got Within Me you sit down you're gonna die old Undertaker you know like brother Tom sitting one over there he reached them to get them old people what arm you know and he's shaking he said just lay around take it easy now you know you you read you were Rich you spent your life you know and I'll she'll now just take it easy well he's the Undertaker he wants you to die I said get up my wife will tell you that this is not a lazy man I'm up and going because I'm not going to let Satan get this body he's gonna fight me for it keep on going keep kicking all right but let's back up there and let's look at this place remember my point now Angels were created while God was still in heaven um so now let's read some of the things right around there to say time just a few minutes then we'll quit number five four on the notes for the joke questions and answers on Genesis paragraph 28 excuse me let me give him a glass of Acts 26. now no man has seen the father at any time see we just read over these we just pass them but listen to your Prophet describing something no man has seen God seen God in the bodily form do you know what you're saying when the scripture says no man is seen the father any time what does it mean what nobody seen it you mean the Angels were in heaven and didn't see you you mean the Angels were created they couldn't see you I thought you believed it when we said a while ago and I thought you when all of that quote was God means your object to worship so are they the angels are first well where's he at work in is it over here is he over I don't see him do you see him come on I'm actually so what does it mean brother Brown when no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in the bodily form now remember Moses was allowed because he wanted to see him he was allowed to see God's back heart brother Randall said you remember in The Rock he passed by and he was able to see him but he couldn't see his face because you couldn't do that but you better believe one thing there was a man one day by the name of Moses that he went closer than just seeing those things because the Bible said he talked to God face to face lit to ear you think he didn't see a lot but look at it why he see no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in bodily form God is a spirit see all right no man answering the father but the only begotten off the father hath declared him declared means to reveal to bring out into the open all right to show him now but notice now there's nothing there's just face there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it's just singing just seems nothing but in dire is a great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all space and uh all space of all places at all times he was Everlasting from Everlasting he is the beginning of the creation that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an atom in the iron or nothing not nowhere no nothing yet God was there that was God he said I'm just watch him unfold going down reading this is questions and answers on Genesis Department of 28. which would be a continual reading room now notice then after a while I began to see a little sacred light began to form like a little Halo or something you could only see it by the spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking at the church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what God's doing well get right down to this question here and you'll see how it brings it in no man has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see May the eyes of Supernatural looking amen we see a little white light forming out there what is that that was called by Bible readers logos are anointed or the anointing or as I was going to say that the power of God began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was it was a little low a little light movie he that was the word of God now God gave himself birth to his son listen which was before there was even an atom in the air or an hour to make an atom that was Jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back under mm-hmm gave birth to his son I asked a question many years ago I said when I say son of God what do you think of and everybody recorded that we're thinking of 2000 years ago I said you can just call it or snow some of you got offended to me for saying that I dug you out of a pit of Hell of your belief and you got upset with me I wasn't making light of you because it was a time I did see it what you see God gave birth to his son of terrorism no because a son is the father made manifest in another form he's just called a son it's a part of God not like an arm went off and he's sitting up there he got an arm you know and we think we fully understand let me get this last part look at the next one 366 your textbook later Center change the beginning of the creation of God this that is who the Lord Jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than godhead now what about this River Jordan Doctrine the message now thing then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not true you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible the word said he's the beginning beginner or author of the creation of God we know for a surety that Jesus is God very God he is the creator or John 1 3 all things were made by him without him with not anything made it was made he is the one of whom it said in Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth also it says in Exodus 20 and 11 for in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that all that in them is and rested the seventh see there is no doubt that he is the creator he was the creator of it and I say that word Creator because I know I I thought I said but I'm emphasized he is a creator I ain't saying he's creature I I don't like it I'll actually create or sorry southern English he was the creator of a Finnish physical creation sure we can see what these words mean now to have any other interpretation would mean that God created God how could God be created when he himself is the creator amen huh now the Trinity developed at nicaea 325 A.D because their thought was that their question if you'll go back and read it you'll see it's right that their question was whether or not that there was one God now they wouldn't argue it now I see a 325 a day or with regards now go read your history go read the book the question wasn't about three gods the question was one thing or just what I just read they were questioning whether Jesus was the same substance of God that's the question that 325 maybe not a trinity that was 606. the question that I see around was whether or not that Jesus was another substance isn't it odd here in the end time that that's where the people of the message are going now they're saying that Jesus wasn't God until the River Jordan they're having their nice evening Council again so they developed it nice here that Jesus was another substance all right that didn't go over too good because Aries and I believe it's athanasia there were two arguments over it and if you'll even read it you'll find out that even the guy that finally developed the Trinity seemed to have a better understanding of the godhead I remember reading that when I was first started in this message but their argument was whether Jesus was almighty God or was another substance so they developed that he was another substance and that's where they've been then developed that it was God in three persons Blessed Trinity they didn't develop that until it become later on in the other doctrines all right giving you that point to get you to see that's my people to say remember I'm saying the multitude stain that God created Jesus and Jesus created everything he said that ain't tried he said he was almighty God himself Elohim stepped over in another form and began to create he said like a father a child playing before the father's door but you see that's what we want to do we want to get our mind into the great thinking and we think we've got it all figured out and we quote run around how old God was he poured into Christ and all Christ poured into church analyze what the people are saying analyze what people are saying all God was he poured into Christ ain't no God left be right back to the Nicene Council and all Christ born in the church ain't no Christ you're right in the devil's trap that he said he wanted to be God and to be worshiped his God you're exactly when I see him running around and said developed it in Ikea was Satan's stronghold and said when they accepted Barabbas and crucified Jesus they exalted Satan to the throne that he desired amen why don't we read why don't we listen to the prophet or at least listen to somebody that can tell you something about what the prophet had to say no but brother Neil I just I just I'm not trying to make nothing I want you to see almighty God is real I want you to see heaven is real yes I want you to see there is a place to go to are you going to do away with Heaven because maybe there's an earth what are you gonna do when the Bible says that heaven and earth will pass away and brother Brown said that is not annihilated he said it changed his name to another form what do you want to do away with any of that why don't we just want to come together in Jesus Christ why can't we see I'll use each note later to finish it up but at least maybe the doctor God is wanting to make himself known to reveal himself to mankind except us a prophet it's not whether or not see when I asked a question right around what is the new birth George Sanders yes this one said this happened I didn't say this is that now they say that it's not justification thank God there's a bad deal with my lord it's just a bad kiss on the Holy Ghost Well everybody's got it then as far as the anointings yeah I believe in the old-fashioned justification of Saint petition baptism in the whole ghost being a new murder so I asked right around the questions what's on Chrysler Crossing mystery God revealed what is it page 45 I'm pretty sure it send a message but around what is the new word he says it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you do you have anywhere because if you don't have a new birth and you don't know where Heaven's real or not you're taking somebody's word for you don't know whether or not God is real you're having to take somebody's words but if you have the experience within your heart see when I come in this message you know the story of what I'm fixing to say for two years I never claim the baptism of the Holy Ghost 99.99 of the people that come in this message say they got your new work because they proved it because they come in the message right I believe everything Prophet said well that can be argued but still I didn't do it because I saw what brother Brown was talking about and you were I still have my trinities and my doctrines and my eternal Hells and my ideas so for two years I studied this message almost rejected my family this was working and and steady when preaching back Dansby is working and studying brother caught me who knows that I can set up there with him day in and day out in red amen six books a day and two takes one going to work one back home why because if I was going to believe the prophecy I wanted to know what he said brother told him he said you've done all of that but you wasn't born again I said no sure it wouldn't mind but I know when the person of Jesus Christ come into this meeting and I knew what everyone was talking about it's a revelation of Jesus Christ's personality to you it ain't what you see I saw God when I was 11 years old you know that how do you heard much lower but I would not accept it he run me until I was which was in 69. it would have made me what 29. did he chase me until he found me that's why I know he's real I don't talk about something I don't know I've had the experience have you had the experience of Jesus Christ in a new birth not a thought or a conch shell you remember when we was bringing that out the other day musician come on you remember what you bring it out the other day about when the Morning Star signed together and the sons of God shouted for joy and they said run around you got a new religion he said no way he said I got the oldest religion that's ever been he said the religion I'm talking about began in heaven before the world ever begun right so you talk to people they think you have a new religion that's just something new doctrine about no we got the oldest one that way it don't deny talking to her to preachers are the other day at the funeral and I said I don't deny anything Luther told Wesley tall Pentecost talk if it was the truth I still believe everybody the truth they taught I believe you I don't have to deny anything now era I don't believe in that and I believe the truth let's Stand Together okay 331 red book I mean we are standing on road 331 you might have a need good there are angels beat up Fallen Angels provide our nature foreign don't believe it what I said you'll see the same as what sin is sin if you and me were any thought oh contrary to God's word foreign foreign
