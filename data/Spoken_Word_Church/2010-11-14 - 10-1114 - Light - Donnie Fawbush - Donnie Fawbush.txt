just to come on the scene this morning and be with each one here and speak to their heart fathers these things we asked in your precious Name Lord Jesus Christ amen uh you got your Bible I want to turn to Genesis one we're going to speak on a little subject that's come to me the other night and uh we're gonna talk about light I want to talk about life this morning um it's not no one yeah okay sorry about that we're going to talk about light this morning um I like it it's got five letters fits right in there with faith in Jesus I love that but we know that numbers don't mean a whole lot other than there are five letters in it and first of all I'd like to read Genesis 1. all right sister two Delights that part Dennis is one two five and get to it I'll bear with me everybody there in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was because he came down here we know that because he is light and God saw the light that it was was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day in the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now there's a another scripture the same John 1 I love this sitting there last night I was waiting at night I kind of time to see if I could find any difference in it but I couldn't because there's nothing there to be different it's all the same all right we're going to read John 1-10 and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the light was the light of men and the light shineth and darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might be leave he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that likeness well unless John that was the True Light which lendeth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world wait a minute the world was made by him and the world knew him not now there ain't a whole lot of difference there because we know what the light is in the beginning and now we're over here four thousand years starting the four thousand years or two thousand and four thousand right here with John uh download research on this word called light uh light brains forth truth Revelation one goodness of God also God's Plan of Redemption Darkness symbolizes error and faults truth and it also symbolizes evil in the works of Satan amen so you look and see one you got to see the other one it's kind of like looking through the seals see one riding the way you see one stand there holding that book and any part of it you got to see who the light is when I first came in here I was trying to figure out who that white horse rider was I was focusing too much on that white horse right all I had to do was look in the mirror there he was but it took a while God says no you're supposed to be seeing me and what's Happening Here anyway I wonder man has always been fascinated with light throughout time they've looked at light and and thought it to be something that they didn't understand what light is uh they even went to the point where there was Sun worshipers throughout all time even today well I know back during the second World War I don't know what they're doing in Japan now but you had all those people who worshiped the light all of that uh the people uh in Babylonian time uh right on through the Greeks they worshiped the Sun and light they dwelled on that light and they had no revelation of what light really meant but they've seen that sun hanging out there and they worshiped it which godness let them or I'm sorry the devil he led them to that light the wrong light I wanted to go over to uh Exodus 10 23 uh where if y'all want to turn that's okay I can pretty much tell you what I want to say about that that's that's where Moses call down judgment or Darkness uh everything Stood Still or stood dark for three days but the only people there that that had light and they had it in their homes was people of Israel and then in Exodus 28 16 . is a I'm not going to ask you to go there because I'm not going to read all that what that's about is the breastplate of the year of Thurman which showed Delight um mostly 28 I mean 16 through 30 is where the instructions of the of the lighthouse was to be put together Hyatt was adorned and how it was worn and Aaron had to wear it over his heart when he went before the presence of the Lord that Aaron Thurman was used for right on up through the time of Ezra was I think was one of the last times they may have used that particular used it there the scripture said and but anyway that you're determined what it meant was is uh the lights in perfection and it was it was put there representing the Lord his presence so he would bring those lights you also had um the people when they were Moses had him out of the desert for what they followed that Pillar of Fire right uh when they had the uh built the temple what was the Shekinah Glory it was light God's always period to us with his life he's always brought himself through that light shining that light on us that he might get our attention because he's trying to show us something and it's uh taking a long time to get us to this point but time ain't nothing to him but this light's always been here with us and I was coming over here the last time that I I that I could pick up they used in the scripture was in 5 BC where Ezra in 263 they had a problem with some of the priests and they had a problem with their genealogy because some of them married and in or out and wasn't married right and so they brought that breastplate in the sword after him priest it didn't belong there and got them out of there and uh then come on down to where Jeremiah was in the days excuse me uh Jeremiah 31 35 that was a part of the I'm going to turn to that one because I need to read a little bit on that one it was part of the Covenant there was an eight part Covenant that he made with the people Jeremiah did to bringing them back and I think reconstructing the temple was talking about it and uh see 3135 there it is let's say at the Lord which giveth the Sun for light by day and the ordinances of the Moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea which the waters they have Roar the Lord of hosts is his name he's telling you there who's doing all this he kind of reminded me of the time that in job where he was talking about who who uh bonded the claws of Earth together it's the simple little things that we don't always see that this light is shining on at all times to sustain Our Lives and uh to me the more I read in this subject last night the more I just I was I was sitting there going wow I didn't really realize and I should have how much that God has this has been one way he's projected himself to us by shining himself on us with his life I'm gonna go over to Psalms 4 . okay and back uh Psalms four and six and when I first started out I said like the number one's truth revelation shows goodness and then it's God's Plan of Redemption I want to read these three John uh Psalms 4 6 7 and 8. first one is to me it it broke it out as the truth there be many that say who will show us any good Lord lift up thou lift up the light of thy kindness upon us thou has put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thy Lord only make us me dwell in safety to me the first one where he said there will be many that say who will show us any good that's the truth part of the life then thou has put down gladness in my heart that's God coming forth with his goodness and then I will both lay me down in peace and sleep let's plan a Redemption because it's playing okay and I want to move on to uh four seven I mean no I don't I'm past that y'all forgive me I got my notes kind of scribbled up here uh is everybody all right y'all follow me okay uh let's see Psalms 27. and we're going to do 27 1. uh let's see psalms 27 1. I love this the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid and then I'm gonna go to Psalms 119 and 105. all right everybody ready Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path now all of this is from the Old Testament and we don't went through John 1 I'm gonna go to First John 1 5. y'all ready this then is a message which we have heard of him and declaring unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all now I'm gonna go back to Matthew 5 14. I should have went there to start off with but y'all give him something around here a little bit we all know that scripture but I love reading it anyway Matthew what 5 14. Matthew 5 14. somebody ready I think I am around here okay you're on the light of the world uh y'all know what he he's doing here okay we all the light of the world a city that is set on the on a hill cannot be hid in other words ain't no way you can hide his life when it comes no way neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it gives life into all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven that's our job as a Christian to everybody that we meet in here outside the greatest gift is being able to take it from in here hear it get it up here let it come down the yard and take it out there and talk to people out in the world it's not an easy thing some people to do but some people I love to run my mouth a lot I like to talk I love people I get so bored if people don't want to talk to me sometime I go talk to the cats I've got to talk to somebody and I love to tell them about this message and every now and then that was up the other day I was over getting at a doctor getting my back adjusted and the little receptionist was talking to me a little bit and something clicked and said a word and I was able to say two or three things to her right off the bat she stood there with her mouth open and she said I've been going to church all my life and I've never heard that I said well read your Bible I'll show you right where it is and I said the next time I come we'll talk a little bit more about it if you want to I said Lord say never leave us a forsake us so he's here to help us do these things you'd be surprised what you have heard but if you don't talk about it how you going to stay in his environment are you going to stay active with you because we can get stale I believe that and all of us here well have jobs like it's like yesterday I was sitting there we had so many things to do I wanted to go to work by 12 o'clock that was a joke I didn't even get out of my pajamas all day long I was fixing a toilet and some other things at halftime and I did and we had go get a washer and dryer Susan did that and you know I finally got out of the house about six o'clock but you never know how it's gonna work and uh but that's what I was supposed to do yesterday because that's what I did yeah budget we must have really got to somebody else here at the nursing home we already talked about the lower level at a time because you cannot give them too much right and this lady asked for prayer for salvation for her family amen she was crying and crying amen so we must have did something I guess sure did he said we're two or three meet my name there I'll be also we we listen now have you ever been out and you know I I've got to kennel this because this really happened and sister Gene can testify that really happened because it happened to her car I told Brother wait out there one day I was saying something about a little the baby Blazers and I said every time we get one of these things the transmission goes just dies honestly but most time it's the motors but the transmission is just go like that and I said you know what that's what happens to them Blazers I said that for my lips I said it now I drove that car home pulled it down in my driveway this car run perfect what happened to it the very next morning I went to back it out of my driveway I forget what I was doing to it nothing no reverse that's true so listen the point is here I showed the wrong light and my brother got hurt because of it and I asked him to forgive me he must have because I'm still here and sister June is uh checking her head out so I mean we have to be careful we're we're not we're not a people that's that's back in the Old Testament where they just had types they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the light is is for to make us to get to that place for Luke 17 30 can be manifested everything's been laid out for us y'all say that it's all laid out for us you go speaking something that's wrong you have to be careful about what you say to people be real careful because they don't know and uh I know I've done that I've been asked to leave a man's pores because I was telling him too much and I got in my car and it was no labeling you know what it wouldn't crank that wouldn't crank that man said if I ever want to know anything about the Bible you know everything unless I'll come get you and I said well brother and I made him at least stand there with him I said listen I apologize for hurting your feelings God knows that ain't what we're supposed to do no Christian is ever supposed to hurt nobody I may have gotten a little too far out there for you and that's my youthful enthusiasm and I I'm sorry I make mistakes too and I just did because I would never ever harm or hinder anybody in any way like that and this guy he wasn't backing off get off of my porch I'm a Baptist and you ain't get out of here because I said okay brother but I I at least got the man to shake my hand and admit and accept my apology because no no he didn't help me push that car me wasn't gonna come out there and help me do nothing he wanted me off of his driveway out of his yard and this car's gone long long you know I ain't afraid of the guy but this is getting a little bit too funny now I mean you know I know you're I know you got a sense of humor and it's okay I don't mind being on the hot seat because I know everything's okay I really I really shouldn't have done what I did and I apologize to you for doing that because I wouldn't hurt that brother for nothing right uh his his brother-in-law has come up to me and said yeah I said you got him good said he needed that I said no he didn't not like that so caught up in it though Tyler and I both saw the man snap yeah oh yeah he was so caught up and you know he was in the spirit he was trying to tell this man something we saw him snap and and it was like we were just wanting to get out of there because we could see him change but Don was just like you know listen I have no fear I really don't I'm not gonna fear when fear comes climbing up your back that's death creeping up on you folks you got to stand on the word you got to stand there and say this is it buy it Stripes I'm Healed and that's it there ain't nothing else to say yes God didn't do all this for me to get here today and say well maybe that part's good and that part ain't I don't like that part I'm gonna tell Ollie out something right now if I never say another word there ain't nothing in this book that I can't agree with you because it's my book God give it to me everybody here I hope and pray that you have that same enthusiasm in your heart about God's word because there ain't nothing else folks I enjoyed watching cartoons when I was a kid seeing the little devil over here in the little uh little angel over here and see you could understand that because that little that good old guy he always was patient and he was always White they had a little light always and he was always just patient and the old dog could get out there and get hurt he'd say no you need to apologize kick that devil off over in the dirt where he belongs but uh anyway there's just so much I need to go on I'm sorry I didn't want to get off because I get excited y'all forgive me because I love this talking about him was the greatest thing that can ever happen in your life anywhere you are any time when he comes on the scene and starts putting the words in your mouth there's nothing like it Australian gift that he just comes to you and starts speaking I love that there's the evidence because if we don't talk about him the rest of the world ain't talk about him folks go to Walmart and look they shame this world I'm sorry but they did okay let me move on here uh I wanted to thank you we got into Matthew here before we know we're all the light you go to come on into Acts now I asked brother Dell a question the other day I know I gotta hurry but I think I'm gonna get through all this I asked him why in the in the Saturday night class why God came as melchized dick he popped down here sprinkled some dust on him come out his male chest dick and of course there wasn't but one form he could show and it's the same form he had at Calgary right right if I say okay is that right that's right okay uh anyway why did he come that way now I knew that that Abraham was was one percent he was at Cornerstone okay of the prophets that built that pyramid okay then prophets coming down through time that spoke that body into existence and it had to be that way had to be perfectly built all the way through couldn't leave nothing out not one thing okay in the Old Testament because if there had been that body wouldn't have been perfect he couldn't have done what he'd done okay now I asked brother Dale why he did that that way was anything other than that of course they talked for a little while but I I kind of run across something and I'd like to ask him another question but I'm gonna go ahead and ask this I wondered sometimes because Here Comes Paul is he was the messenger of I mean no more books than anybody in this new testament the Lord allowed him to do that used him to do that Here Comes Paul down that road to Damascus and he was struck down by that light right there and I I was I I don't know maybe in my mind sometimes brother Dale knows me thank God he does because he can sift through my thoughts and he will he'll do he'll pull it out of me but I would like to ask him sometimes you know wonder if Paul was walking on that same road that God come down his male chest and walked out there on top of Abraham pretty close wasn't he because of Abraham hung around over there where the where the future home is going to be and that's where God said he would now they do what they want to over they give that land away if they want to it ain't gonna make no difference they ain't theirs and give them never was there's a beginning it ain't gonna be theirs in the end because we already know the plans what's going to happen but anyway I'm gonna ask him that when he gets back uh I want to touch on uh Romans 13 12 right quick I hope y'all don't mind me reading all these scriptures I just kind of want to show you throughout this whole Bible there's nothing else you can really what is that at there he did okay uh 13 12. if I can get over to it and then I'm gonna read two things and then we're gonna go here we go almost 13 12. the night is far span and the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness we gotta do that that's death during this time and let us put on the armor of light what is the armor of light God's word Gotta Have It I've heard people tell me that they got God living in their heart they got this and they got that I got a guy that's working with us and he does that and he's he says certain things and boy he's smart he comes right down the line and the other day I finally told him I said brother I said I'm going to tell you something I'm kind of like Jacob I lie to you and tell you I got to baptism my Holy Ghost and you're gonna sit back and watch and see what I do but I'll lie about it because I want it that bad I want it I'll confess it and I'll keep doing it until God does come and give it to me because if you don't confess it you ain't gonna get it because if you can't speak it like bad Transmissions if they can speak that we can speak the other things right and that's the way I look at that because you have to be able our word is who we are and what we are inside he said if it comes across these lips that's where it is I want to read one more right here I'm gonna go to I want to show up one other thing here on the book that to the message of the hour that we are showing that the light was here brother Brown I'm sorry I've got quotes in here I wanted to read but I didn't get to read them on him um anyway if I get to it y'all be turning to Revelations 21 23. here's the seven Church ages that shows what Darkness and Light okay wouldn't have been no light at that Prophet not came God not seen him wouldn't have been on this last stage y'all it would have been done I don't know God God wasn't going to let that happen but that's the reason he sent that profit he had to come and bring us this okay got that now Revelations 21 23 this I really really really really like 21 23. okay what a gift what we're looking for and it all ends up from you go back in Genesis one where he was the light to hear and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the Moon shine in it well the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof what a promise what a truth brother Branham that Lake of Fire hanging over you took a little Jewish boy from that's just to take his picture
