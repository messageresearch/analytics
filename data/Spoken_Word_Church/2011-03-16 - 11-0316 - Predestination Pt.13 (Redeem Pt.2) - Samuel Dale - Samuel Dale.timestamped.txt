[12:06] that should be the god and father of our
[12:07] lord jesus christ who have blessed us
[12:10] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[12:12] places in christ according as he has
[12:15] chosen us in him before the foundation
[12:17] of the world that we should be holding
[12:19] without blame before him in love
[12:21] having predestinated us unto the
[12:23] adoption of children by jesus christ
[12:26] himself
[12:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[12:29] will
[12:30] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[12:32] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[12:35] blood in whom we have redemption through
[12:38] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[12:40] according to the riches of his grace
[12:43] wherein he had to bound it toward us in
[12:45] all wisdom and prudence
[12:47] having made known unto us the mystery of
[12:49] his will
[12:50] according to his good pleasures which he
[12:53] had purposed in himself
[12:54] to do what that in the dispensation of
[12:57] the fullness of times he might gather
[12:59] together in one all things in christ
[13:02] both which are in heaven and which are
[13:04] on earth even in him
[13:06] in whom also we have obtained an
[13:08] inheritance being predestinated
[13:10] according to the purpose of him who
[13:12] worketh all things after the council of
[13:15] his own will that we should be to the
[13:17] praise
[13:19] of his glory he first trusted
[13:22] in
[13:22] christ now let's go over to titus
[13:30] we'll read verse 11 through 14
[13:34] titus 2.
[13:38] for the grace of god
[13:40] that bring us salvation hath appeared to
[13:42] all men
[13:45] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[13:48] worldly lust we should live soberly and
[13:50] righteously
[13:51] and godly in this present world
[13:54] looking for that blessed hope and
[13:56] glorious appearing of
[13:58] the great god and our savior jesus
[14:01] christ who gave himself for us that he
[14:04] might redeem us from all iniquity
[14:07] and purify
[14:08] unto himself a peculiar people
[14:11] zealous of good works you may be seated
[14:14] the lord that is blessing to the reading
[14:16] of the word now i hope you brought back
[14:18] your quotes because that's what we were
[14:20] having our sunday there's only about 20
[14:23] of these
[14:24] of each one so if you have yours from
[14:26] sunday just
[14:28] don't take these and you know but if you
[14:30] don't have them then you know because
[14:32] that's what we we were trying to try to
[14:34] get on sunday but we
[14:36] we got too far along in trying to
[14:38] express some things
[14:40] and
[14:41] you know then we didn't get into the
[14:43] notes that we have but anyhow we'll try
[14:45] to get on to that tonight
[14:48] and
[14:49] try to express our point
[14:51] now
[14:54] we read
[14:55] here in the scriptures about the
[14:58] redemption
[15:00] all right
[15:01] and uh
[15:02] you know we were trying to cover their
[15:04] sunday and i'll just review just a
[15:06] little bit
[15:08] that
[15:09] the word redeem
[15:13] means to
[15:14] you know to bring back or restore to
[15:17] original condition
[15:18] but then other words in there that we
[15:20] would take with that
[15:22] is uh you know
[15:25] it brings us to a
[15:27] concept or a thought see like the word
[15:30] redeem would be going backward you know
[15:32] and that's what i've i've tried to
[15:34] express to you
[15:35] that
[15:36] uh if we can
[15:38] talk about predestination
[15:41] and we can talk and go forward in
[15:43] predestination and and look forward to
[15:46] great things to take place
[15:48] on down through the endless eternities
[15:50] or the revealing of god's word
[15:53] you know and i believe that and that's
[15:54] wonderful but then if you can't take
[15:57] that same predestination
[15:59] and go back
[16:01] just as far as you can go forward
[16:04] then
[16:05] uh where would you what would you have
[16:08] uh you know you can't uh say well you
[16:11] know well now i just want to be redeemed
[16:13] back so far
[16:15] well
[16:15] uh you got a problem
[16:18] because
[16:19] the the the word redeem means to go back
[16:21] where you come from
[16:24] but now we're in
[16:25] as paul calls it
[16:28] in hebrews and colossians and all
[16:32] he calls it
[16:34] in hebrews 9 verse about 15 he calls it
[16:37] eternal
[16:38] redemption amen that's right now eternal
[16:42] redemption
[16:44] all right
[16:45] now the word as i said
[16:47] redeemed means to go back
[16:51] the word redeemed
[16:54] i gave the definition to you on the back
[16:56] of your your uh one of your your notes
[16:59] there you know and you can look at it
[17:01] and you'll see what the words are
[17:03] dealing with
[17:04] because the word redemption
[17:08] the word redeem means to go back
[17:11] all right
[17:13] the word redeemed is the past tense of
[17:16] that
[17:17] that can be dealing or showing it
[17:19] finished
[17:20] and the word redemption
[17:23] is a process that's going on
[17:26] the to to bring us to a condition
[17:30] and you know a position here on earth
[17:33] and that's definitely what we want to do
[17:36] but we got down to a point and i i
[17:38] didn't get to i don't think i got this
[17:40] far because i was just trying to explain
[17:43] the difference between redeem and
[17:44] redemption and and and you know and if
[17:48] you'll notice you'll find a lot that
[17:50] we'll get back to the end at the end of
[17:51] the message but in each one of the
[17:54] definitions if you'll read that you'll
[17:56] find
[17:57] that it has the word ransom
[18:01] involved in it all right and ransom is
[18:04] what is given in exchange
[18:10] for the price of redemption
[18:13] all right we'll get to that in a little
[18:14] while
[18:15] but
[18:16] see
[18:17] the point i've tried to make to you is
[18:20] and we put a whole
[18:21] two or three messages there on people
[18:24] saying you know and believing well well
[18:26] brother i i i've got the quotes i always
[18:29] was eternal
[18:31] well i believe that of what the prophet
[18:34] is talking about
[18:36] but i don't believe it as the definition
[18:39] of what people have to my way of looking
[18:41] at it has made it to turn out to be
[18:44] because if you say you always was
[18:47] eternal
[18:48] then there was no reason
[18:51] for jesus christ to die
[18:54] that that's that's a simple statement
[18:56] that's not something that you have to
[18:58] have a a 12th grade education or a
[19:01] college degree or some kind of something
[19:03] to understand it's just plain language
[19:06] that you know that if you you uh
[19:11] say i come into the world with eternal
[19:13] life then jesus christ never had to die
[19:16] right amen
[19:17] all right and then you you've been the
[19:19] same people that would talk about always
[19:22] was eternal
[19:24] they'll talk about redemption
[19:27] well now if you would always was eternal
[19:33] what would you need redemption for
[19:36] that's right
[19:40] do you understand what i'm saying if you
[19:41] if you say always was eternal
[19:44] then why would you even be dealing with
[19:46] the word redemption
[19:49] because the word redeemed would mean to
[19:51] go back where you come from
[19:53] well if you always was eternal
[19:57] where would you go back to
[20:02] see as you begin to analyze
[20:05] our thoughts a lot of times and we just
[20:08] take quotes of the prophet and
[20:10] scriptures to our own uh benefit and in
[20:14] our own thinking we don't realize that
[20:16] we we cross ourselves up so much until
[20:19] you know it's it's not even sensible
[20:22] about what we're saying
[20:25] now i pre preached to you over and over
[20:28] to show you and we gave them where the
[20:30] prophet was saying if you have eternal
[20:33] life
[20:34] you always was eternal all right
[20:37] i believe in that what i believe the
[20:39] eternal life you have right
[20:43] always was eternal but i believe there
[20:45] was a time you had to receive eternal
[20:47] life
[20:48] before you had it
[20:50] all right
[20:50] now as far as god is concerned
[20:54] that's one situation but as far as we're
[20:56] concerned as another and the prophet
[20:58] said you start your eternal life right
[21:00] here at the all right amen
[21:03] well
[21:04] see then but get the point of what i'm
[21:06] saying see i believe what he's saying
[21:09] i believe we're just taking the wrong
[21:11] thoughts about what is being said
[21:15] thanks to just say well well i i just
[21:17] believe what the prophet said you know i
[21:19] i i i
[21:22] i always was eternal we don't need the
[21:24] new birth
[21:28] you don't need anything if you always
[21:30] was eternal like that
[21:32] but the eternal life that you have
[21:35] always was eternal because it's only one
[21:37] form of eternal life
[21:40] all right and like i covered we that
[21:42] like the foolish virgin one day
[21:44] after watching judgment they'll be given
[21:47] eternal life
[21:48] well they spent their whole life in the
[21:50] world and all of the things in existence
[21:52] and finally at the ending of all things
[21:55] they will come forth and receive eternal
[21:57] life
[21:59] well why can't we see that we
[22:01] we were born in sin shape and iniquity
[22:03] sprouts from our mother's womb went
[22:04] forth lost doomed and on her way to hell
[22:08] and needed a savior
[22:13] needed a ransom pay for us
[22:18] to work that he could transmit his
[22:20] eternal life to us
[22:23] and you don't get eternal life just by
[22:25] saying well you know i just want it
[22:32] it has to be imparted unto us
[22:35] all right and see then if you believe
[22:37] that it's imparted unto you then you can
[22:40] believe
[22:42] that it's a possibility that you can be
[22:44] redeemed
[22:45] amen amen
[22:48] all right
[22:49] now see then that way
[22:51] your plan of redemption is in the full
[22:53] view
[22:55] and surely we don't believe this type of
[22:58] person we're looking at here of the
[23:00] human elements the prophet said that had
[23:03] a beginning
[23:05] and see it must one day be made eternal
[23:10] all right now
[23:11] if your body was
[23:14] not eternal this is something i'm gonna
[23:16] say and then i'm not gonna say anymore
[23:17] i'm just gonna make the point all right
[23:19] i do this a lot because i i just click
[23:22] that into your thinking and then you'll
[23:25] go home and you'll consider it
[23:27] but see
[23:28] your body was not eternal
[23:31] the new birth don't give you eternal
[23:33] life in your body
[23:36] all right
[23:38] now
[23:39] what are we going to do dealing with
[23:40] redemption in that
[23:47] did you hear what i said it
[23:51] where are you going to redeem your body
[23:53] to
[23:54] right
[23:58] just let you think a little ahead of
[23:59] time
[24:01] all right
[24:03] now what have we been dealing with
[24:07] we've been dealing with
[24:09] the basis that
[24:11] god by his foreknowledge
[24:15] could look down through time and see
[24:19] each person
[24:21] and that way he could predestinate
[24:25] that person
[24:26] because of his foreknowledge of seeing
[24:29] what we would desire
[24:32] so he would see that your desire to be
[24:34] saved
[24:36] when it's the other person wouldn't
[24:38] receive it because of the way that it
[24:40] would be brought
[24:42] now there's not a person in the world i
[24:44] don't believe there's ever been a person
[24:46] in the world at all that wouldn't in
[24:48] some way want eternal life
[24:51] now i i just i don't i don't think like
[24:54] that
[24:56] i think everybody wants a happy hunting
[24:58] ground you know the old indian to go to
[25:01] i think everybody wants that
[25:04] but
[25:06] the price of being
[25:08] to receive it
[25:10] is the reason we don't like it
[25:12] and don't want it
[25:14] we said we have to give up too much
[25:17] well i don't believe you give up
[25:18] anything to be a christian i i'm you
[25:20] know i don't believe that but that's
[25:22] what we think right
[25:26] but we better do this and do that to be
[25:27] a christian now we need to get born
[25:29] again
[25:31] but still see
[25:33] there is things that comes along with
[25:35] being given up
[25:38] and a lot of people are not willing to
[25:40] do that right
[25:42] so thereby they won't never receive
[25:44] eternal life
[25:47] because they're not willing to give it
[25:48] up
[25:51] but you see if god if god could look
[25:53] down through and see then he can
[25:55] predestinate according to his
[25:57] foreknowledge and and it wouldn't be
[26:00] him with respect to persons but he would
[26:03] know what would take place upon the
[26:05] earth
[26:06] all right
[26:07] but then we started dealing then that
[26:09] the prophet said
[26:12] everything is forgained
[26:15] by foreknowledge
[26:17] right right
[26:19] everything that ever happened in the
[26:20] world every person would ever be in the
[26:21] world ever that would ever you know bat
[26:24] its eye and all of this that and the
[26:25] other
[26:26] by god's foreknowledge he would know
[26:30] all about that
[26:32] if not he's not god
[26:34] so then we don't have to worry about
[26:35] nothing anyway
[26:36] maybe we're the god you know
[26:39] maybe we're smarter than than any kind
[26:41] of uh you know doings or whatever you
[26:44] know
[26:44] no i don't think so
[26:47] but anyhow
[26:49] but we did get down to covering what
[26:53] that it's not the person
[26:56] that comes predestinated eternally from
[26:58] god
[27:01] but to see their word
[27:02] right all right now so then every person
[27:09] would be predestinated by foreknowledge
[27:13] right amen
[27:15] that's sensible isn't it amen if there
[27:18] is a god
[27:20] if he knows all things and like i said
[27:22] if he don't then we gotta worry about it
[27:25] but we know we do
[27:28] now
[27:30] so then we come down to the basis of
[27:32] seeing that it's not the person that
[27:34] comes predestinated eternally that's
[27:36] right
[27:38] i don't care what you think you are or
[27:39] who you think you are how great you are
[27:42] you come in the world lost
[27:45] if not we don't need a
[27:46] redeemer right right
[27:48] but you see why people they'll build a
[27:50] statement yet you're just on that old
[27:52] school of thought well that old school
[27:55] is held far enough and it's been here
[27:58] all the way through
[27:59] and i don't have to worry about it
[28:03] because i'm a firm believer that you
[28:05] must be born again
[28:07] i'm a firm believer that you must
[28:09] receive eternal life to have it
[28:13] yes but you just don't believe all the
[28:15] quotes
[28:17] well bring them and let's see
[28:19] i took them over and over and over then
[28:21] references through you do you show
[28:23] through messages but
[28:25] if you have eternal life you always was
[28:28] eternal what the eternal life always was
[28:31] he came in
[28:34] but there was a day i didn't have that
[28:36] it had to be given unto me
[28:39] all right
[28:40] but then we come down to believe
[28:44] if paul said in hebrews
[28:46] that there's an eternal redemption
[28:48] that's right
[28:50] all right so then there's something
[28:52] that's
[28:54] eternal
[28:56] there's something predestinated
[29:00] eternally from god
[29:02] now here's the point i want you to see
[29:04] though
[29:06] because something is predestinated
[29:08] eternally does it give that eternal life
[29:16] well yeah if it's predestinated
[29:18] eternally then it didn't
[29:19] no
[29:21] because the word or seed is
[29:23] predestinated eternally but that don't
[29:25] make the word or seed eternal
[29:31] he said well that's that's getting down
[29:33] show me how to say it any other way
[29:38] that word you receive
[29:41] has got to be made alive
[29:44] then it's eternal because if not paul is
[29:47] facing you was saying the letter
[29:51] right come on
[29:53] the letter kill it
[29:58] but the spirit giveth life
[30:00] all right so then
[30:03] we must deal with the fact of seeing
[30:05] that the word is what's
[30:07] predestinated eternally
[30:10] all right now
[30:12] then to believe in redemption
[30:18] right
[30:19] then it would mean that
[30:22] something did at one time exist
[30:27] but it became lost
[30:31] or you're not dealing with the word
[30:32] redemption
[30:34] right so if you come with eternal i see
[30:37] then you would never lost
[30:40] see that's what people want to see they
[30:41] want to see some great glory or
[30:42] something like that and it said but
[30:45] you're just dealing with them old
[30:47] ways of things well i'll just stay there
[30:49] you just going down the road and
[30:51] we'll meet down one of these days and
[30:53] find out what's right
[30:56] but you see
[30:59] to redeem something means it had to beat
[31:02] our somewhere
[31:05] and then lost
[31:09] or you wouldn't be redeeming it
[31:13] when it says redeem
[31:15] right
[31:17] it means to do over again
[31:20] that's why jesus told nicodemus you must
[31:23] be born again
[31:27] because your first birth was wrong
[31:30] all right so now we're to believe that
[31:33] our first birth is wrong
[31:37] but yet there was something about us and
[31:39] i don't see why this wouldn't thrill our
[31:40] souls
[31:43] you know people say well this you know
[31:44] you just don't you you just make it so
[31:46] dry until i don't get excited about it
[31:49] but brother so and so he just says a few
[31:51] words and i just get all elated
[31:54] what'd he say
[31:58] we said i can't explain it i just
[32:01] believed it i always was eternal
[32:12] well see then
[32:15] you go ahead and deal with that yourself
[32:18] but you see i believe that you must be
[32:20] born again
[32:22] amen
[32:25] but there was something about you
[32:30] that would make the plan of redemption
[32:33] come into view
[32:37] to where you can return
[32:40] now everybody right around said
[32:42] everybody wasn't in god's predestination
[32:44] to be able to return
[32:50] only only the elect right
[32:53] can be redeemed right
[32:56] but see do you understand what i'm
[32:58] saying then
[33:00] if you're gonna deal with redemption now
[33:01] if you're not gonna deal with these
[33:02] things just forget it go home be happy
[33:05] and just just you know
[33:08] but if you're gonna talk about
[33:09] redemption
[33:10] if you're going to preach we always was
[33:12] eternal don't preach nothing about
[33:14] redemption
[33:18] because you don't need to be redeemed
[33:20] right
[33:22] but brother dale how is it that
[33:25] that we could be something and then be
[33:27] lost
[33:32] that's a good question
[33:36] because if you don't see that then you
[33:38] can't see it and understand the word
[33:40] redeem
[33:45] because you see then
[33:47] if you can see
[33:50] that it's not the person
[33:54] that comes predestinated eternally
[33:56] it's the word
[33:59] or seed right
[34:01] all right
[34:02] so now what was it before the world
[34:05] right
[34:09] is the word of seed
[34:14] but it became lost
[34:17] no no no no wait just a minute how can
[34:19] the word be lost
[34:21] well you explain to me what it is
[34:24] i'm open for suggestions
[34:32] that word
[34:39] it wasn't lost like
[34:41] thrown away lost
[34:44] but the prophet of god said
[34:47] all right
[34:49] in the seal message
[34:51] that
[34:52] when man sinned
[34:55] he said the book
[34:58] went back
[35:00] to the hand of the one
[35:03] that owned the book
[35:05] and watched the book
[35:07] the word
[35:09] the seed
[35:12] that's right so there was no way to
[35:13] bring it forth
[35:19] there was no way to bring forth the word
[35:24] right
[35:25] because
[35:26] it was lost
[35:30] all right
[35:31] now if the word was lost
[35:36] see then
[35:38] that word can be brought back
[35:40] if it was god's word right but if it's
[35:43] our ideas now come on you ain't dealing
[35:46] with redemption right right yeah all
[35:48] right our ideas don't melt anything
[35:52] but see
[35:53] then that way you could look back and
[35:55] see the word
[35:59] and see how that word would come forth
[36:04] and then see the mankind on earth
[36:07] that was supposed to become that word
[36:13] and see the fallen condition
[36:16] all right
[36:17] now
[36:21] see brother randall says look at you
[36:23] look at your notes on number two there
[36:27] who is this melchizedek
[36:32] he said you bypass the theophany that's
[36:34] right
[36:36] it causes the outnea word body
[36:42] all right
[36:45] i gave you one and then this one on on
[36:47] paragraph 70 in the same message
[36:50] so you bypass the theophany
[36:53] and become flesh man
[36:55] to be tempted by sin
[36:59] all right
[37:00] now it may have i don't i think the
[37:02] notes or the numbers are still the same
[37:04] with what you hit sunday but anyhow
[37:08] what did you bypass
[37:18] he became the word
[37:23] all right
[37:25] jesus christ almighty god
[37:28] now not jesus the flesh okay all right
[37:31] jesus christ almighty god became
[37:34] the word
[37:37] the theophany the word body he calls it
[37:40] if you're reading it
[37:43] you're reading it see that's what people
[37:45] do
[37:47] they'll quote brother brown
[37:48] out of away from what he's saying and
[37:52] and try to make it some doctrinal
[37:54] thought
[37:55] now you showed me where he wrote around
[37:57] said you bypassed the word all right
[38:02] he
[38:14] if you bypass the word
[38:20] then
[38:23] you have no hopes of ever being redeemed
[38:27] because if
[38:30] the word if you wasn't a part of the
[38:33] word before the world ever begun when
[38:36] are you going to become part of the word
[38:37] right
[38:40] you see people quote said you bypass the
[38:42] word i want you to show me that
[38:48] how could you bypass the word
[38:52] and be part of the word
[38:54] before the world begun
[38:58] and if you're not part of the word
[39:00] before the world begun you never will be
[39:04] that's right
[39:06] amen
[39:09] if you're not part of the work before
[39:11] the world you never will be the word
[39:16] man
[39:17] i see we ought to get down and settle
[39:19] down and listen
[39:23] and not just take our ideas
[39:26] because i've listened to people
[39:27] explaining that for
[39:28] 35 or 40 years now you baptize the word
[39:37] you bypass the word to become flesh
[39:43] jesus
[39:45] didn't bypass it that's right
[39:49] amen
[39:51] but how many quotes do you want from
[39:52] brother brown
[39:53] that if we wasn't in jesus we'll never
[39:56] be
[39:57] there amen
[39:59] if we wasn't a part of the word before
[40:01] the world begun we never will be part of
[40:04] the word
[40:10] but you see that
[40:11] you take your own concept or thought
[40:13] about what's being said let's read what
[40:15] brotherhood said on progress 67
[40:18] who is this melchizedek
[40:21] now we see the attribute sons of his
[40:24] spirit
[40:25] have not yet entered into the word
[40:29] form
[40:30] body
[40:34] are you listening
[40:41] word
[40:42] form body
[40:50] you just say you bypass the word
[40:52] right
[40:54] he said you've not yet entered into
[40:56] the word form body
[41:02] the theophany said but a theophany this
[41:06] body is subject to the word and
[41:08] earnestly waiting for the earnest
[41:10] change of the body
[41:11] now the difference between him and you
[41:13] is a son
[41:16] see he was at the beginning the word
[41:20] an immorphy body
[41:24] he came in and lived in that in the
[41:26] person
[41:28] of melchizedek
[41:34] you never heard of more melchizedek
[41:35] because it became jesus christ
[41:37] melchizedek was the priest but he became
[41:39] jesus christ now you bypass that
[41:43] because in that form he knowed all
[41:46] things
[41:47] and you've never been able to know that
[41:48] yet
[41:55] now let's analyze what he's saying
[42:00] oh but i just believe it
[42:04] i just believe it
[42:10] believe what
[42:13] you know your soul is hinged upon one
[42:16] word
[42:18] it only took one word to bring us out of
[42:20] this situation in the garden
[42:23] and we're not going back with one word
[42:25] off
[42:30] right right but brother hell you just
[42:32] don't understand god he's
[42:34] uh i know it but i understand what he's
[42:37] saying
[42:40] jesus came in a word
[42:45] formed
[42:48] body
[42:51] that's where it was when you create the
[42:52] world
[42:56] now that's a body right
[43:02] so we never came in a word form body
[43:06] right
[43:08] amen
[43:10] that's sensible amen
[43:15] he said well we bypass the word show me
[43:17] where he says it
[43:22] he said we bypass the word foreign body
[43:25] we apply past the
[43:27] amorphy body
[43:29] the theophany
[43:38] but if we wasn't in him
[43:44] we never will be in him
[43:50] if we wasn't in jesus christ when he was
[43:52] in that word form body
[43:58] will never be in him
[44:03] is that sensible
[44:08] do you need a lot of quotes for that
[44:11] if you wouldn't a part of the words you
[44:12] never would be part of the word
[44:15] they wrote over in the message
[44:17] well see why did we buy pies
[44:25] and we take bye pies like 285 goes
[44:28] around atlanta you know
[44:34] that's the only word that the way we can
[44:37] you know put a definition on both eyes
[44:42] or either it's like something you come
[44:43] up to
[44:44] then you got to move over and then you
[44:46] got to move out and you move
[44:49] so you bypassed
[44:52] why don't you just sit in plain language
[44:54] you didn't come that way
[44:56] is that sensible enough that's right
[44:59] would that mean we bypassed
[45:02] it we just didn't come that way we
[45:05] didn't come what way
[45:09] we didn't come in a word
[45:12] formed
[45:13] body
[45:15] an immorphy
[45:17] amen that's right
[45:19] we didn't come that way
[45:24] but i keep saying if we wasn't in him we
[45:26] will never be no word
[45:32] see when he came we was in him i thought
[45:35] that's what we believed
[45:38] where the scripture says i you and you
[45:39] and me
[45:42] i ain't using to understand people say
[45:43] oh get the new word but what about
[45:47] me and you and you and you and me
[45:53] but you see we got all these thoughts
[45:54] and ideas that comes along
[45:56] about sarah and abraham and nissan and
[45:59] that one and adam and eve
[46:04] you know according to my understanding
[46:08] adam come here with eve in him right
[46:13] eve didn't come here with adam and her
[46:20] when jesus christ came into the world
[46:23] if we have eternal life right
[46:27] that eternal life that he had is now in
[46:30] you amen
[46:32] that's right
[46:34] because back there when he stood there
[46:36] as a theosony body the creator
[46:40] they said let that be
[46:43] all right
[46:48] we had to be in him
[46:53] but we never came a word for body he
[46:56] said we become the word here
[47:01] read who is this mountain
[47:04] we become the word here
[47:09] he was the word all right
[47:14] he was the creator
[47:17] that logos theophany
[47:19] whatever you want to call it speech that
[47:21] came out from god was a part of god or
[47:24] god in another form
[47:26] called the word
[47:28] that created the world
[47:29] there he was then
[47:35] this was hard for you to say but there
[47:37] was jesus christ now you know what i say
[47:40] about it
[47:42] jesus was the only name god ever had
[47:44] christ means the anointing
[47:48] not jesus the flesh when you say jesus
[47:51] everybody thinks about flesh no no no no
[47:53] no
[47:56] it was the only name god ever had
[47:59] what was the name of that angel of the
[48:00] covenant in the old testament said
[48:02] beware of him because my name is in him
[48:06] what was his name
[48:09] his name was jesus
[48:13] so when i say jesus christ i mean
[48:15] almighty god the eternal
[48:20] see he never bypassed
[48:25] that
[48:26] he came that away
[48:30] but it was one body
[48:35] all right
[48:37] now he came from god over into that form
[48:40] as we want to call it right
[48:44] stepped over into a form or whatever you
[48:46] want to call it you know to bring him
[48:48] forth
[48:49] because it's the same god
[48:52] but you see we didn't get to do that
[49:01] now
[49:03] listen very carefully
[49:06] that was not the fall
[49:14] the fall was not when we couldn't come
[49:16] that way
[49:18] you know it didn't come that way that's
[49:20] not to fall
[49:24] god was fully intending
[49:27] to bring every one of us exactly
[49:32] the way that original son was brought
[49:34] forth
[49:36] would you agree
[49:40] because he knew
[49:44] that if he put that man on earth
[49:47] he would not fall
[49:54] there was no way that that man could
[49:56] fall that i'm talking about right
[49:59] that man christ jesus
[50:03] that in morphy that
[50:05] theophany man that word
[50:08] he couldn't fall
[50:12] to us not to fall because we didn't come
[50:14] that way
[50:20] but it did put us where we could be
[50:21] redeemed
[50:23] right
[50:24] right
[50:27] but by whitney
[50:30] so then
[50:33] we didn't get to come the way that man
[50:35] came
[50:37] did you catch what i said
[50:41] that man
[50:43] in that condition that word that son of
[50:45] god theophany loco was god in another
[50:48] form right that's right
[50:51] called a son
[50:53] there was no way for him to fall
[50:57] don't ever make him fall
[51:04] but because
[51:07] that we didn't step out there right then
[51:10] in the same condition
[51:12] he was in
[51:16] he brought us into a condition
[51:22] come on are you listening
[51:24] when he stepped out there he was the
[51:26] word he would be eternal god
[51:29] there's no way he could fall
[51:34] even putting him in flesh
[51:40] which was making the connection to the
[51:42] human right the desires the thoughts the
[51:44] things of of life
[51:47] but there was no way he could fall
[51:52] because he's a word to start with
[51:56] right
[52:01] but you see we didn't get to come that
[52:03] way why
[52:05] because this same one
[52:10] had attributes
[52:13] of a savior
[52:15] of a healer
[52:19] those attributes were already a part of
[52:21] him right
[52:22] that's right i've told you over and over
[52:23] he didn't gain attributes as he came
[52:25] this way
[52:26] those attributes were just as real as
[52:28] could ever be
[52:32] the only way you'll ever be redeemed is
[52:34] to see it that way
[52:36] he had those attributes
[52:39] and those attributes were a part of him
[52:42] there was no way that it could ever be
[52:46] it wasn't going to come that way
[52:50] so he never intended to set us there
[52:53] like him
[52:57] he could not display his attributes had
[52:59] he done that
[53:01] because it had never been anybody lost
[53:03] it had never been anybody sick that had
[53:04] never been any problem right right
[53:08] because that theophany man standing
[53:09] there that god in a human form as we
[53:12] want to call it you know look like a
[53:13] human
[53:17] the prophet said had better eyes better
[53:19] ears
[53:22] if we think of a theologian is not
[53:23] having anything i used to preach it that
[53:25] way until i got corrected
[53:28] i'd say your soul has no
[53:30] faculties in it but then i come to find
[53:32] out the prophet said when you go beyond
[53:34] the curtain of time in that way in a
[53:35] theophany in your soul and it connects
[53:37] he said it's got all of the senses
[53:43] i had it wrong and i had to admit i had
[53:44] it wrong
[53:48] but do you follow what i'm saying now is
[53:50] everybody with me this whether you
[53:51] believe it or not i'm just saying ask
[53:53] god to reveal it
[53:56] when that man that we call the christ if
[53:59] you want to call him that
[54:03] the theophany man
[54:08] he was in a one one-form
[54:10] amorphy body
[54:13] right the word
[54:17] what
[54:18] there was no way it could fall
[54:21] no possibility for a fall to exist
[54:25] had he brought that away
[54:27] there would have been no possibility of
[54:28] a fall
[54:34] but he didn't choose to bring us that
[54:36] way
[54:39] he chose for us to come here
[54:43] and be tempted the prophet calls it who
[54:45] is it who to spell chapter he said we
[54:46] come here to be as humans to be tempted
[54:49] of sin
[54:52] see he knew we were going to fall
[54:57] he couldn't make us fall
[55:01] but he knew
[55:02] we were going to fall
[55:05] so instead of bringing us here as that
[55:07] theophany man to stand there like him
[55:12] we might fight staff
[55:15] but keep in your mind don't ever forget
[55:17] if we wasn't in him we never will be in
[55:19] him so that's the only way you're going
[55:20] to find redemption
[55:25] i don't think i'll get that far tonight
[55:26] but we'll go as far as we can
[55:29] but listen
[55:33] he didn't devise a plan
[55:37] he just did what we do
[55:42] he knew all he had to do was just put us
[55:44] here his mortals
[55:49] you know god's got confidence in us
[55:55] you think of it that way he's got
[55:56] confidence in us he knows what we can do
[56:02] he knew if he ever put us here we'd fall
[56:04] amen
[56:07] all right what'd he do then
[56:13] that eternal god that word began to
[56:15] create make a world etc etc made all the
[56:18] animals made all the things
[56:21] and then to show that he was still
[56:23] trying to keep it in the right channel
[56:26] and was not the author of sin
[56:30] he made a man named adam right
[56:35] he made a body spirit in a soul
[56:39] and he called him adam right
[56:46] and then he placed according to
[56:47] blasphemous names he breathed the breath
[56:49] of eternal life into adam's nostrils
[56:52] and adam became a living soul
[56:56] um so there was adam
[57:02] the man that was made to rule the garden
[57:08] right
[57:12] and that spiritual extent of man to rule
[57:14] the garden
[57:19] but then one day made him in flesh
[57:23] still didn't create him wrong created
[57:25] perfect
[57:28] still tracking to make sure everything
[57:30] would stay in the right channel he gave
[57:32] that man eternal life
[57:36] you can argue all you want to he must
[57:38] have gave it to eve when she came
[57:40] because brother branham said and you
[57:42] just quote all you want to i know what
[57:43] brother running said he said eve was in
[57:45] adam and theophany so all right
[57:48] forget it that's right you can argue all
[57:50] you want to ain't going to argue with
[57:51] you about it
[57:56] because inside of adam
[57:58] was eve amen
[58:01] not in a sinful condition right
[58:04] no way
[58:10] another random i know what he says
[58:12] he said see there
[58:14] satan was her designer
[58:18] now he didn't design her
[58:22] god was eve's designer
[58:25] come on you said what the prophet said
[58:27] satan was satan took over after god got
[58:30] her here
[58:32] he didn't desire wrong
[58:36] god never made her playing language so
[58:39] hot nature she couldn't stand it he
[58:41] didn't do that
[58:42] right
[58:43] sorry for the wording but it'll get the
[58:45] point across
[58:48] he made her perfect
[58:53] he took part out of adam and made a body
[58:56] right
[58:58] he created a
[59:00] spirit and a soul
[59:02] and put it in that body
[59:05] and like i said i believe she had
[59:06] eternal life
[59:13] but yet she was
[59:17] not a lesser degree
[59:23] but the only difference between adam and
[59:25] eve was one thing
[59:28] adam stood there as the word
[59:35] right
[59:37] adam was the word
[59:41] he had eternal life
[59:44] he could control the animals in his
[59:46] spiritual condition then in his natural
[59:49] condition he still had the rule of the
[59:50] animals
[59:53] and he had eternal life
[59:55] that's why he wasn't deceived
[1:00:02] brother lee vale he used to preach it in
[1:00:04] this good point but
[1:00:06] you know how you want to carry it that's
[1:00:07] up to you but
[1:00:09] he said we talk about that beast and eve
[1:00:12] he said
[1:00:13] what about the female beast running
[1:00:15] around after adam right
[1:00:18] but see there's no way to get adam to
[1:00:20] sin
[1:00:22] he was too close to god
[1:00:26] i just wish we could get there for one
[1:00:28] little inch and get away from this
[1:00:29] sinful condition and i believe one day
[1:00:31] we will
[1:00:33] but
[1:00:35] see he wouldn't listen
[1:00:38] he was the
[1:00:40] word all right
[1:00:43] what else are you going to call them
[1:00:45] but see when eve come along
[1:00:48] the only part of her that wasn't
[1:00:51] in the correct top order with adam
[1:00:56] well she was taken from adam's body
[1:01:00] and made a byproduct
[1:01:04] now not that god made her wrong
[1:01:07] that's right
[1:01:08] we call her a
[1:01:10] hybrid now how could god make a hype
[1:01:12] written be just
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:15] i've heard that preached over and over
[1:01:17] and more look at our adder she just made
[1:01:18] a hybrid show it took me the prophet's
[1:01:20] message
[1:01:21] show it to me in the bible how could god
[1:01:23] make a hybrid
[1:01:27] god made horses and and donkeys and man
[1:01:30] put them together and made a mule
[1:01:33] that didn't come from god
[1:01:36] right he wasn't the creator of the mule
[1:01:41] he allowed it
[1:01:44] but you see adam and eve standing in the
[1:01:45] garden in a beautiful position
[1:01:51] but what's eve now you got to remember
[1:01:53] what she was
[1:01:57] now don't get this in the wrong realm
[1:02:01] i believe adam was body spirit and soul
[1:02:05] and then god gave him eternal life
[1:02:08] well what would he have done with eve
[1:02:13] see because i know what a lot of people
[1:02:15] thinks about it and they'll go ahead and
[1:02:16] preach it anyway they think that she was
[1:02:18] made such a much lower until she didn't
[1:02:20] have no huh
[1:02:26] your prophet said it i didn't he said
[1:02:28] she was co-equal
[1:02:31] don't do what you want to
[1:02:35] she was co-equal with adam
[1:02:39] the only difference between adam and eve
[1:02:40] was adam's body was spoken pure by the
[1:02:43] word of god eve's body was a secondary
[1:02:46] in the basis that he brought it out of
[1:02:48] adam but you know how i pre-set and i
[1:02:50] believe it
[1:02:52] that makes her actually greater than
[1:02:54] adam in the extent of one thing
[1:02:59] he took part of adam to make eve he
[1:03:01] didn't take part of the earth to make
[1:03:02] eve
[1:03:04] he took part of adam to make ease
[1:03:06] don't make it such a wrong thing make it
[1:03:08] the right story
[1:03:14] but you see she began to do one thing
[1:03:17] and you say now you can't do that with
[1:03:20] eternal life
[1:03:21] you're full of garbage cans all i got to
[1:03:23] say
[1:03:24] you're sitting there right now reasoning
[1:03:26] in your mind what i'm talking about
[1:03:28] you're sitting there right now trying to
[1:03:30] figure out what i'm saying and what's
[1:03:31] going on
[1:03:32] and you have eternal life
[1:03:35] blessing oh
[1:03:38] i don't ask for a regular hand but how
[1:03:40] many of you got eternal life hey man you
[1:03:43] had a bad thought today
[1:03:46] you done any reasoning lately that was
[1:03:48] wrong
[1:03:54] i saw what happened ever
[1:03:59] oh how these was she just turned to her
[1:04:01] reasoning that's right
[1:04:06] she wasn't no different
[1:04:10] she was the same product
[1:04:13] i believe that
[1:04:15] she come from adam that's right
[1:04:18] oh my brother brown said she's a
[1:04:20] byproduct you know
[1:04:23] what is about product you ever looked it
[1:04:25] up in dictionary
[1:04:28] how many have you ever looked up with
[1:04:30] the word byproduct
[1:04:33] you don't go and get your dictionary
[1:04:35] tonight look at it
[1:04:38] it says a thing of equal value
[1:04:42] are greater
[1:04:44] value
[1:04:46] oh look up the word my brush
[1:04:48] do we think my product is like adam was
[1:04:50] a great big porterhouse steak you know
[1:04:53] but he was a piece of dog meat
[1:04:57] and you show me that
[1:04:59] but that's the way it's preached in this
[1:05:01] message
[1:05:02] see that's why we're still here 40 years
[1:05:04] later
[1:05:09] i don't mind talking like that that's
[1:05:11] why we're here 40 years later
[1:05:13] because it's the hardest thing in the
[1:05:14] world to get people to realize what what
[1:05:16] adam and eve was in the garden and how
[1:05:18] beautiful position they was in the only
[1:05:21] problem with these was she begin to
[1:05:23] reason
[1:05:28] you know what she wanted to hit god
[1:05:31] because that's the way satan approached
[1:05:33] her
[1:05:37] you know yours made for this
[1:05:41] look at all the other animals in the
[1:05:43] female position
[1:05:46] and you were made for this place
[1:05:48] adam just won't tell you that
[1:05:55] all right come on
[1:05:59] she began to reason
[1:06:04] and as she reasoned
[1:06:06] she lost her holy position
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:12] the bible said she was deceived which
[1:06:14] means
[1:06:15] she didn't know better
[1:06:17] right she thought she was doing right
[1:06:21] playing blood language you mean a woman
[1:06:23] would receive an animal
[1:06:26] and and they don't realize it wrong
[1:06:32] come on get sensible
[1:06:40] look at it sensibly
[1:06:42] she thought she was doing right
[1:06:45] you tell a woman preacher today she's
[1:06:47] not called to preach
[1:06:50] that's right
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:55] she'll tell you in a hurry that god
[1:06:57] called her
[1:06:59] and she'll show you signs and wonders
[1:07:01] and she'll show you great things that's
[1:07:03] happened in her ministry
[1:07:07] like that lady years ago that brought
[1:07:08] him up never knew
[1:07:10] she said well i've never seen anything
[1:07:13] greater than brother branham's ministry
[1:07:15] except my own
[1:07:22] you're not going to change nothing
[1:07:29] i wasn't the one that made the statement
[1:07:30] your prophet did and you know what he
[1:07:32] thought of women he loved good women but
[1:07:34] he said
[1:07:36] you're one thousand times easier to be
[1:07:37] deceived
[1:07:41] that ain't got nothing to do with your
[1:07:43] education your smart ability and how
[1:07:44] much you know about computers and i'm a
[1:07:46] dummy with them that don't have anything
[1:07:48] to do with it
[1:07:50] it means you're easier to be deceived
[1:07:54] slick tongue man
[1:07:57] talking to you and telling you how
[1:07:59] pretty you are
[1:08:03] telling you how beautiful you are and
[1:08:05] how that your husband has not been
[1:08:07] a husband to you he's
[1:08:10] yeah slick tongue
[1:08:13] come on
[1:08:15] but be sensible about it just think
[1:08:17] about it
[1:08:18] once she started reasoning that brought
[1:08:20] the sin in the picture
[1:08:24] lust when it's conceived
[1:08:27] lust
[1:08:28] is not sin
[1:08:31] come on
[1:08:32] lust when it's conceived
[1:08:34] bringeth for sin sin when it's finished
[1:08:36] brings death right
[1:08:41] all right
[1:08:42] but you see
[1:08:43] so eve
[1:08:47] then brought to mankind and adam
[1:08:51] you know loving his wife
[1:08:53] desiring not to lose her because he knew
[1:08:55] immediately that she was dead
[1:08:59] you didn't have to be told what she done
[1:09:00] was wrong
[1:09:03] you want a dummy
[1:09:04] right but he knew that she was dead
[1:09:11] sure she was walking around yeah but he
[1:09:13] knew what she'd done was wrong
[1:09:16] he walked out of the garden with her
[1:09:19] you say that was the type of christ
[1:09:20] that's all right
[1:09:23] you can use that as the top of christ
[1:09:25] but don't talk too much there
[1:09:28] because christ didn't become sinful
[1:09:32] now adam became sinful
[1:09:34] so be careful how you type
[1:09:36] well i gotta type here brother be
[1:09:38] careful just keep reading your time
[1:09:42] because
[1:09:44] jesus christ
[1:09:46] never becomes sinful to redeem us
[1:09:51] he took upon himself the form of sinful
[1:09:53] man
[1:09:58] see then what is it
[1:10:00] he bypay i mean we bypass that word
[1:10:03] because had we stepped down in that word
[1:10:05] form wouldn't there have been no sin
[1:10:08] even adam stepped out of there in a
[1:10:10] condition that there was no sin
[1:10:13] right right
[1:10:16] there was no sinning adam
[1:10:21] but when he stepped forth in the next
[1:10:24] party
[1:10:26] and started her reasoning there was no
[1:10:28] sin in her when she was created right
[1:10:34] you can't make glory after a sin
[1:10:39] when she started reasoning upon god's
[1:10:43] there's your sin
[1:10:46] god knew before the world
[1:10:48] that all he had to do was just put us
[1:10:49] here
[1:10:50] in a perfect state
[1:10:54] and we'd fall
[1:10:56] i thank god for his promises
[1:10:59] you know what so
[1:11:02] that if god don't move on the scene in a
[1:11:04] little bride in the end time and take
[1:11:07] her out of here because he promised her
[1:11:09] he'd do it we would dive in and fall
[1:11:13] it's oh no
[1:11:16] oh yes
[1:11:19] because the thing that's in that mind
[1:11:21] telling you oh no is the very thing that
[1:11:23] was in the garden talking to eve
[1:11:29] if it wasn't for god's promises you and
[1:11:31] i wouldn't be stepping out of here in a
[1:11:33] rapture
[1:11:35] i don't deal up on some kind of this i
[1:11:37] deal up on what he promised
[1:11:43] my salvation is based upon what god
[1:11:45] promised
[1:11:50] but you see
[1:11:51] then that's why we never come like adam
[1:11:59] we didn't come like adam that's right
[1:12:02] and we come like adam
[1:12:06] stay in that condition of adam
[1:12:09] there's been no fault
[1:12:13] so he made one more step
[1:12:17] he made a church
[1:12:20] called eve
[1:12:24] made her right
[1:12:25] perfect
[1:12:29] but he knew what she'd do
[1:12:34] he knew how easily she would be deceived
[1:12:39] so he has not a snake crawling around
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:46] but an upright creature a beast
[1:12:49] that could talk to eve and begin to
[1:12:51] reason with her
[1:12:53] and i don't believe it was a five minute
[1:12:54] of fire
[1:12:59] no telling how long
[1:13:01] that that process went on we just read
[1:13:04] that he talked to him
[1:13:05] you know
[1:13:08] it could have been hundreds of years
[1:13:10] involved
[1:13:13] you say oh i don't know well one would
[1:13:16] be enough
[1:13:18] don't have to worry about it
[1:13:21] one whole day would be enough
[1:13:24] but you see she had to thank things out
[1:13:27] that's right right
[1:13:30] she thought she was right
[1:13:34] well brother dale i gotta write today
[1:13:37] brother brother said that's where the
[1:13:39] wrong was in the garden
[1:13:41] now you need to quote
[1:13:43] he said she said i think
[1:13:50] if i was you sisters i'm just as honest
[1:13:52] as i can be i would try to find my right
[1:13:55] place in god
[1:13:59] you know how i preach and the way i've
[1:14:00] always preached to you
[1:14:02] i believe the sisters have got their
[1:14:04] right place in god to believe and serve
[1:14:06] god and to raise a family and all other
[1:14:09] things like that i believe in that i've
[1:14:11] always preached it to you so don't
[1:14:12] misunderstand me now
[1:14:14] but if i was your sisters i'd find my
[1:14:16] place
[1:14:20] i'd get before god and i'd cry out to
[1:14:22] find my place
[1:14:29] and brothers
[1:14:32] do you realize the prophet said she'll
[1:14:34] never have to answer for you right
[1:14:36] that's right
[1:14:37] but said you'll have to answer for her
[1:14:40] that's right
[1:14:41] oh of course now i've seen that too but
[1:14:43] god you straighten up
[1:14:45] prophet sat on the head this house
[1:14:52] now you show me that in christ
[1:14:58] i've seen some of you
[1:15:01] and everything that i thought needed to
[1:15:05] a little correct
[1:15:08] but also look past into the line and see
[1:15:10] what's there
[1:15:13] god gave me that ability years ago to be
[1:15:15] able to look past what i see
[1:15:17] if he had not done condemned every one
[1:15:19] of us to hell
[1:15:24] i look down and see a desire in a person
[1:15:26] i deal with that more than i do what you
[1:15:28] doing
[1:15:30] and i would do that
[1:15:36] but listen
[1:15:40] so then we must have been in jesus
[1:15:43] christ
[1:15:47] he was here in a word form body a
[1:15:50] theophany
[1:15:51] an amorphy
[1:15:56] and he said we come to earth and we
[1:15:58] bypass that word form body
[1:16:02] we come here
[1:16:03] to be tempted of sin
[1:16:07] but you see
[1:16:08] by the fact that we was in jesus christ
[1:16:14] means we can be redeemed
[1:16:18] because everybody wasn't in jesus christ
[1:16:24] now come on go all the way back in your
[1:16:26] foreknowledge the way we've been
[1:16:27] bringing it
[1:16:28] god by his foreknowledge knew who would
[1:16:31] want to be saved and who wouldn't
[1:16:34] and he sent jesus christ to pay the
[1:16:36] price
[1:16:37] amen cry
[1:16:39] that's right
[1:16:42] everybody will never be redeemed because
[1:16:44] everybody wouldn't predestinate it
[1:16:48] everybody's predestinated by four
[1:16:50] knowledge yes
[1:16:52] but everybody's not a predestinated seed
[1:16:55] right our word
[1:16:58] see by being in
[1:17:00] jesus christ back there in that word
[1:17:02] body
[1:17:03] we can be redeemed
[1:17:08] because redeemed means to go back
[1:17:11] to where you come from
[1:17:14] all right
[1:17:16] now
[1:17:19] how far do you want to go back
[1:17:22] and what part of you do you want to talk
[1:17:24] about redemption
[1:17:27] because we were not in jesus in bodily
[1:17:30] form
[1:17:32] back there in the theophany
[1:17:36] now the prophet will bring it down and
[1:17:37] he'll say we walk the shores of galilee
[1:17:40] and jesus we we dive in him we've rose
[1:17:42] in him we've done this that and the
[1:17:44] other but now you know with plain common
[1:17:47] sense he's not talking about your body
[1:17:51] if you don't know that about playing
[1:17:53] common sense please get some
[1:17:58] you want an idiom in body
[1:18:10] what were we
[1:18:15] he said in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:18:16] quicken
[1:18:17] that's right
[1:18:19] if you didn't become seed by the rebirth
[1:18:22] you were seed and could be born again
[1:18:27] the seed is the only thing that can be
[1:18:29] redeemed
[1:18:38] so until we get back sunday with it
[1:18:40] let's just stop right there
[1:18:42] i don't mean quit the sermon i said stop
[1:18:44] right there with our progressive
[1:18:46] backward
[1:18:47] and just talk a little bit about
[1:18:50] because i gave them to you all over in
[1:18:52] the message
[1:18:54] the quotes
[1:18:56] brought around said we had to be a part
[1:18:58] of god
[1:19:00] or we never will be there that's right
[1:19:04] what does it mean to be a part of god
[1:19:09] to be a part of god
[1:19:13] to be part of the eternal god
[1:19:20] you remember i told you years ago in
[1:19:22] preaching on it be careful how you
[1:19:24] redeem because you can redeem yourself
[1:19:26] clean out of existence
[1:19:32] then we don't found out if you believe
[1:19:34] you come in the world always was eternal
[1:19:37] and you don't need a savior and all like
[1:19:39] that then you don't believe in
[1:19:41] redemption
[1:19:47] so if you don't believe in redemption
[1:19:49] you can't be redeemed
[1:19:55] so if redeemed means what it means to go
[1:19:57] back where you come from
[1:20:01] then when the lord jesus christ says
[1:20:04] that theophany word
[1:20:06] son of the living god the creator when
[1:20:09] he stood on earth if we wasn't in him we
[1:20:11] never will be in him
[1:20:16] it's impossible to be any other thing
[1:20:20] we if we wouldn't in him we can't be in
[1:20:22] him
[1:20:26] so then do you see where you can be
[1:20:27] redeemed back to
[1:20:32] you can be redeemed back to what you
[1:20:34] bypass
[1:20:37] but you know what i like about it
[1:20:41] not going to be redeemed back that away
[1:20:46] this is another thing that we're going
[1:20:47] to have to deal a little bit with
[1:20:50] because you see
[1:20:52] what was back there has got to come here
[1:20:57] right here is where we get our
[1:20:58] redemption
[1:21:00] we don't have to go to heaven to be
[1:21:02] eternal
[1:21:04] we start it right here
[1:21:08] but if we wasn't in jesus christ then
[1:21:10] there's no way to be redeemed
[1:21:15] do we become here to what
[1:21:18] word born body
[1:21:21] because that's what jesus was
[1:21:25] we become the word here the prophet said
[1:21:27] as you receive the word
[1:21:29] you're becoming the word
[1:21:32] see so let's quit looking over there
[1:21:37] let's quit looking back there and start
[1:21:38] looking here now
[1:21:40] amen the rest of the message tonight
[1:21:43] keep your thoughts right here now
[1:21:49] we become here
[1:21:53] what he was down
[1:22:02] and when he died
[1:22:05] i died in him
[1:22:10] resurrected i resurrected any
[1:22:15] or else i'm not a part of it
[1:22:20] so eternal life
[1:22:22] never had a beginning
[1:22:24] never had an indie
[1:22:27] but see you and i came into this world
[1:22:29] once the fall came
[1:22:31] you couldn't have made
[1:22:33] abel cain or whoever would be coming
[1:22:36] forth you couldn't make them with
[1:22:38] eternal life
[1:22:39] that's why it's not spoke of anymore
[1:22:44] the whole old testament you don't find
[1:22:47] eternal life coming into position as a
[1:22:50] believer with eternal life
[1:22:55] that's why abraham
[1:22:58] was god's servant
[1:23:03] doesn't call him god's son
[1:23:07] he was his servant
[1:23:10] those old testament saints were servants
[1:23:12] of god
[1:23:14] but when the new birth came on the day
[1:23:16] of pentecost
[1:23:17] it's sons of god amen amen
[1:23:22] even when we leave out of here
[1:23:25] in a rapture
[1:23:26] 144 thousand
[1:23:29] listen
[1:23:30] we'll receive eternal life right right
[1:23:33] right but you know what they're called
[1:23:38] they're named and said hold those wars
[1:23:40] until the servants were sealed in their
[1:23:42] forehead and when we go the prophet said
[1:23:45] to the millennium 144 000 will be their
[1:23:49] servants to the right
[1:23:52] even though they have eternal life
[1:23:57] so being sons and daughters of god is a
[1:23:59] lot to be said
[1:24:04] so then you don't see that
[1:24:06] theophany spoke of except when you come
[1:24:08] down later to melchizedek
[1:24:12] you see it in forms or ways of the angel
[1:24:15] of the covenant or something
[1:24:19] but then to melchizedek when he came to
[1:24:21] abraham
[1:24:24] to bring the promises and things
[1:24:27] literally said you see no more of
[1:24:29] melchizedek
[1:24:30] because he became jesus christ
[1:24:34] the melchizedek had no beginning of days
[1:24:36] and no ending of life
[1:24:39] jesus's body had a beginning
[1:24:41] and had a time that had to be made
[1:24:43] eternal
[1:24:45] melchizedek
[1:24:46] that body outside was not melchizedek
[1:24:49] melchizedek was the emorphy god standing
[1:24:52] inside of there like aaron said you take
[1:24:54] a little dust and potash and patrol him
[1:24:56] sprinkle it around the theophany you got
[1:24:59] melchizedek
[1:25:05] but you see folks
[1:25:07] the prophet said we become the word here
[1:25:13] that's right
[1:25:14] we've got to become what jesus was when
[1:25:16] he was walking when he was back there as
[1:25:17] you create on
[1:25:18] that's right
[1:25:20] but you see if we was there in him we
[1:25:21] can be redeemed back to there
[1:25:26] are you listening
[1:25:29] listen folks we were standing there
[1:25:32] not as people
[1:25:34] not his body spirit soul like we look at
[1:25:36] it
[1:25:37] right that's what we want we want some
[1:25:40] kind of a feeling with background the
[1:25:41] problem said you didn't know anything
[1:25:43] about it said was your spirit he said no
[1:25:45] you wouldn't nothing you're just in his
[1:25:46] mind
[1:25:47] but it was in his mind
[1:25:50] was in his mind
[1:25:54] he knew what was going to take place
[1:25:57] that's why when the morning star sang
[1:25:59] together in the book of job
[1:26:01] the sons of god shouted for joy brought
[1:26:03] around said it was when they saw the
[1:26:04] plan of redemption come into view he
[1:26:06] said maybe that was when
[1:26:09] the lamb stood as a slain before the
[1:26:11] foundation of the world
[1:26:14] but brother dale i believe that when i
[1:26:16] come into this world i had something
[1:26:17] different you know where the prophet
[1:26:19] said it was put
[1:26:22] i ask you that question that's in your
[1:26:23] notes as a matter of fact it's in there
[1:26:25] twice i repeated it
[1:26:27] and unintentionally but i think it was a
[1:26:29] good intention
[1:26:31] i thank his broken sister
[1:26:34] he said where was it put tire where was
[1:26:36] the seat putting you at he said before
[1:26:38] the foundation of the world
[1:26:45] i thought he put in there when i was
[1:26:46] born as a baby now your prophet said it
[1:26:48] was put there before the foundation lord
[1:26:52] you see that's what we've been taught
[1:26:54] all these years that's why it's so hard
[1:26:55] to preach the truth
[1:27:00] this took 40 years to get us away from
[1:27:02] the trinitarian concept
[1:27:08] right amen
[1:27:10] we're finally beginning to realize
[1:27:16] wasn't that what the prophet is was
[1:27:18] bringing out sunday
[1:27:19] he said that little eagle he said little
[1:27:21] eagle could be an eagle for a long time
[1:27:24] before a son of god could be a son of
[1:27:26] god before he recognizes
[1:27:29] you know that little eagle was never
[1:27:30] born to chicken
[1:27:34] they didn't put a chicken egg under that
[1:27:36] chicken and they passed it out and it
[1:27:38] become an eagle they put an eagle egg
[1:27:44] when you're born again you're born again
[1:27:46] as a child of god
[1:27:49] but it may take you a long time read the
[1:27:51] stories
[1:27:54] it takes you a long time to recognize
[1:27:57] let me quote brother branham the last
[1:27:59] message he preached
[1:28:01] is the only time he made this statement
[1:28:03] he said
[1:28:05] i see now
[1:28:07] that i am not the son of charles and
[1:28:10] ella branham
[1:28:15] 40-something years
[1:28:19] the man preached the gospel
[1:28:22] something that wouldn't
[1:28:24] because he started preaching before the
[1:28:25] ohio river not seen it that would have
[1:28:27] been 33.
[1:28:31] but one day he said i'm not the son of
[1:28:33] y'all to never bring him
[1:28:37] i realize i come from god
[1:28:43] you know if you come from god you've got
[1:28:44] to go back to god there's redeemed
[1:28:47] that's right
[1:28:48] see jesus now watch it and i'll finish
[1:28:52] when jesus was here
[1:28:55] he said i come from god
[1:28:57] i go back to god
[1:29:01] now that body come from god as a
[1:29:03] creation
[1:29:06] but that body was made eternal
[1:29:10] right
[1:29:11] so he wasn't dealing with his physical
[1:29:13] body
[1:29:16] he was dealing with a great higher more
[1:29:18] than ever a theophany body
[1:29:20] a word body
[1:29:26] and see we bypass being that that's what
[1:29:28] we're doing here now
[1:29:30] you're becoming a word body now it's
[1:29:32] what you're doing
[1:29:35] he was the son of man
[1:29:39] he was a sort of name let me
[1:29:41] let me get something
[1:29:43] just finish up with it
[1:29:47] and if i can find it
[1:29:50] i wrote it down look in job while i'm
[1:29:52] turning
[1:29:59] somebody may have to help me find it
[1:30:01] there because i get it written in my
[1:30:02] nose joke 33.
[1:30:09] if you're going to talk about redemption
[1:30:10] you know what you got to have
[1:30:15] you got to have somebody to be able to
[1:30:16] pay ransom
[1:30:19] right
[1:30:20] so if you gotta have somebody pay ransom
[1:30:22] that means you've lost
[1:30:26] right
[1:30:28] see
[1:30:32] i love this i remember preaching on it
[1:30:34] many many years ago
[1:30:35] job 33 and 24.
[1:30:44] 33 23.
[1:30:48] if there be a messenger with him an
[1:30:50] interpreter one among a thousand to show
[1:30:53] unto man his uprightness
[1:30:56] then he is gracious unto him
[1:31:00] and saith
[1:31:02] deliver him from going down to the pit
[1:31:06] i have found
[1:31:08] a ransom
[1:31:12] job wanted somebody to be able to stand
[1:31:14] between god and him
[1:31:18] and pull him together
[1:31:20] you've heard the prophet explain that
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:24] look in matthew 20
[1:31:27] you'll see that i am trying to study on
[1:31:29] something
[1:31:31] but i get tied up and trying to preach
[1:31:32] about it and i just lose all thoughts
[1:31:35] try to preach what the lord gives me so
[1:31:37] look at matthew
[1:31:39] 20.
[1:31:45] now remember
[1:31:46] job said i've found a ransom
[1:31:49] somebody that can pay the price
[1:31:53] matthew 20 and 28.
[1:32:01] even as the son of man came not to be
[1:32:04] ministered unto
[1:32:06] but to minister
[1:32:07] and give his life a ransom
[1:32:11] for many all right
[1:32:13] now we wouldn't lost why do we need a
[1:32:15] ranch
[1:32:17] in exodus 20 30 and verse 12 you'll find
[1:32:21] that they were dealing back there with a
[1:32:23] rant some money
[1:32:25] it had to be paid for each soul
[1:32:30] you'll find in psalms 49 and verse 7
[1:32:33] that no man
[1:32:36] can pay this ransom
[1:32:42] it took god to pay the ransom
[1:32:46] but job said i found a ransom
[1:32:49] i found somebody that can
[1:32:51] redeem me
[1:32:53] he pay the price
[1:32:56] so everybody just stay with me like i'm
[1:32:58] saying here's the piece of paper holding
[1:33:00] them on tape
[1:33:02] just stop right here with me
[1:33:05] that if we wasn't in jesus christ when
[1:33:07] he was at work theophany we can never be
[1:33:09] there
[1:33:13] but if we were there
[1:33:15] we can be redeemed
[1:33:17] work
[1:33:19] to that that we didn't get to come right
[1:33:23] that's right
[1:33:24] we only want to deal with redeem as like
[1:33:27] trying to make something oh redeem me
[1:33:29] i'm going back oh boy i blessed i was up
[1:33:31] there and i was just walking around this
[1:33:32] and the other night
[1:33:39] redeem means to go back where you come
[1:33:40] from
[1:33:42] so we was in jesus when he was there as
[1:33:44] the creator god
[1:33:47] the theophany
[1:33:49] the word body
[1:33:52] we had to be part of the word or we
[1:33:53] never will be but we never come in that
[1:33:56] word body form
[1:33:57] we do that here
[1:34:00] here's where the eternal life starts and
[1:34:02] here's where the theophany has to come
[1:34:04] forward into its final manifestation to
[1:34:07] step us across there
[1:34:10] that's why i believe that when you're
[1:34:12] born again your soul is your theophany
[1:34:17] i know what the work theophany is
[1:34:18] dealing with dealing with the body of a
[1:34:20] god
[1:34:22] i thank god for that i don't want to be
[1:34:23] the body of a god of some other kind
[1:34:25] that's right
[1:34:27] right amen i want to be the body that
[1:34:28] god lives in amen
[1:34:32] take on these things
[1:34:36] redeem
[1:34:39] so we keep we believe then
[1:34:41] that we were in jesus christ
[1:34:45] and had there not been a fallen
[1:34:47] condition
[1:34:48] of existence come into being
[1:34:54] we would have just stepped out there
[1:34:59] and been a wonderful place
[1:35:02] but there was what attributes in our
[1:35:04] savior our god
[1:35:08] that he wanted to display
[1:35:11] so he permitted us to come into a place
[1:35:14] that he knew that when we did we would
[1:35:16] take on the wrong thing
[1:35:19] and like i've always tried to say
[1:35:22] you can believe all the how spiritual
[1:35:24] you are
[1:35:25] but just
[1:35:26] remember no man
[1:35:30] is a match for the devil
[1:35:33] and that's what your prophet says the
[1:35:35] holy ghost is the only one who can
[1:35:36] handle him
[1:35:38] the holy ghost would come on down and be
[1:35:40] christ which would be michael and
[1:35:41] remember the well priesthood here while
[1:35:43] back even you go back to the book of
[1:35:44] daniel and you'll find that gabriel a
[1:35:46] great archangel of gabriel that could
[1:35:48] deliver messages but he couldn't whoop
[1:35:50] the devil
[1:35:52] he had to call michael on the scene
[1:35:56] christ had to come
[1:35:58] you're no match for the devil it don't
[1:36:00] make no difference who you think you are
[1:36:02] right when you think you are
[1:36:05] you're right in the trap of the devil
[1:36:07] like i told you the man that worked
[1:36:08] there one day said i'm not working on
[1:36:10] commanding
[1:36:11] the devil anymore
[1:36:13] no you're not
[1:36:15] he said no i'm working on commanding god
[1:36:22] where's the scripture he said where it
[1:36:24] says there command ye me
[1:36:28] that don't mean
[1:36:30] that you're commanding him
[1:36:33] it means you're just asking him and
[1:36:34] believing it'll take place
[1:36:38] i'm working on commanding the lord so i
[1:36:41] worked on getting away from it
[1:36:44] and i never discussed anything with him
[1:36:46] again
[1:36:48] why because if he was that far then let
[1:36:50] him go i'm sorry
[1:36:52] i love people but you're gonna get in
[1:36:54] the butthole if you start trying to back
[1:36:55] up in there with them that's right but
[1:36:57] don't do it that's where we go 15 in the
[1:36:59] red bull 15.
[1:37:03] i am
[1:37:12] again
[1:37:31] but now my soul is saved
[1:37:35] i'm in the process of redemption
[1:37:38] of the body
[1:37:44] because it had a beginning
[1:37:49] it's gonna be redeemed
[1:38:13] talking about ability to go back
[1:38:26] say we should be redeemed
[1:38:33] oh
[1:38:53] oh
[1:39:10] in you that you'll take care of all the
[1:39:12] needs of whatever it is
[1:39:37] how
[1:39:44] oh
[1:40:25] we thank you
[1:40:49] it evidently worked
[1:40:54] maybe that's what we ought to do
[1:40:57] put them in your prayer blog
[1:40:58] you know i mean you're you're a medical
[1:41:00] captain you open the door where i
[1:41:02] mentioned there heard
[1:41:17] don't worry about it we'll cut up some
[1:41:18] more handkerchiefs
[1:41:20] put them there and believe it
[1:41:23] could not believe it
[1:41:26] we had one one stand he got his still
[1:41:28] under his watch
[1:41:29] because he went through an operation and
[1:41:32] we had a story years ago you first tell
[1:41:35] about it just these people were in
[1:41:37] prison
[1:41:38] and this girl had had them to pray for
[1:41:39] her
[1:41:40] you know and brought her a breath cloth
[1:41:42] when she'd go to sleep at night and to
[1:41:44] sleep all night
[1:41:45] and some of the others you know because
[1:41:46] of the bad things that was in the prison
[1:41:49] would you know they they couldn't sleep
[1:41:51] and
[1:41:51] so

[1:41:53] sleep and she told them their secret
[1:41:56] well you know what that girl asked her
[1:41:58] said well there's any way that i could
[1:41:59] borrow that prayer cloth no
[1:42:02] she said okay
[1:42:04] so she took the prayer ball
[1:42:06] from the lady you know

[1:42:10] to sleep you know what happened
[1:42:13] the one that give her the prayer cloth

[1:42:24] so believe it and go on with it and
[1:42:26] thank god for it
