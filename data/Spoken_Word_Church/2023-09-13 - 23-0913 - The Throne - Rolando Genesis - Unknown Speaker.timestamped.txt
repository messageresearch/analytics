[7:47] I just want to say this though um God is
[7:50] so faithful uh when I started my journey
[7:53] with him it's been on and off for years
[7:55] and uh I didn't receive the Holy Spirit
[7:58] at first so I didn't really know what
[7:59] all that meant so I did a lot of falling
[8:00] and getting up and falling and
[8:02] backsliding all kind of stuff and um
[8:05] but um once I learned what that Holy
[8:07] Spirit really was for and I learned how
[8:10] to call out and cry out for it
[8:13] I believe I got it and um I believe the
[8:16] day one I got it also
[8:17] but it's still a journey it's still you
[8:19] know you fall you get back up you know
[8:21] and um and I had to actually learn to
[8:23] trust them I didn't trust the Lord right
[8:24] away uh you know I didn't know I still
[8:27] want to do things my way and sometimes
[8:28] I'm still like that because I'm kind of
[8:30] stubborn I've been on my own for so long

[17:31] and then uh verse 5 it says after this I
[17:36] look and behold a door was opened in
[17:38] heaven and the first voice which I heard
[17:41] was as it were of a trumpet talking with
[17:44] me which said come up hither and I will
[17:46] show the things which must be Hereafter
[17:50] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[17:53] behold ashron was set in heaven and one
[17:58] sat on the throne Let's uh
[18:01] uh red verse 5 and out of the throne
[18:05] are proceeded Lightnings and thunderings
[18:08] and voices and there were seven lumps of

[19:25] of the Lord
[19:27] praise God hallelujah
[19:30] and uh
[19:31] this evening I would like to ah
[19:37] share with you
[19:40] with the topic of the throne
[19:44] amen hallelujah that's wrong or God's
[19:47] throne
[19:48] Hallelujah
[19:50] and uh when Brian
[19:53] he used this text when it says after
[19:57] this
[19:58] he said that after the seven Church ages
[20:01] and then
[20:03] John was summoned to come up hither and
[20:08] God showed him
[20:10] ah many things things that are that will
[20:15] ah happen Hallelujah in the future
[20:19] Allelujah and one thing that God had
[20:23] showed to John was and he says uh come
[20:27] up hither and I will show the things
[20:29] which must be hereafter
[20:31] and the first thing that John saw in
[20:34] heaven is as in Universal and
[20:36] immediately I was in the spirit and
[20:39] behold asron was set in heaven and one
[20:43] sat on the throne
[20:45] there is only one sitting on the throne
[20:48] so some people they teach that uh there
[20:52] are three Gods two Gods but
[20:56] the thing that John saw there was only
[20:59] one throne and there was only one
[21:02] sitting on the throne
[21:04] Hallelujah so and God said oh brother
[21:07] him said that when God God when he is
[21:12] enthroned
[21:13] he is then judged
[21:16] he is a judge once God sits on the
[21:20] throne
[21:21] Hallelujah and
[21:24] it is a fearful thing you know brothers
[21:27] and sisters it is a fearful thing to
[21:31] stand before God when he says in the
[21:34] throne
[21:35] because once he sit on the throne he is
[21:38] a judge Hallelujah and a lot of people
[21:43] ah they think that God they always think
[21:47] that God is love
[21:48] and sure he is a god of love Hallelujah
[21:53] and
[21:55] but the thing that uh didn't that they
[21:58] didn't know is that God is also a god of
[22:01] wrath amen Hallelujah
[22:04] once he sits in the throne he is no
[22:06] longer he is not uh like Abraham said
[22:09] that he is our uh what do you call that
[22:11] a grandpa you know Hallelujah but he is
[22:15] a righteous judge hallelujah what is
[22:18] wrong is wrong and what is right is
[22:20] right
[22:21] what is uh good is good and what is evil
[22:24] or Sin is Sin Hallelujah and it is a
[22:28] very fearful Thing Once Hallelujah you
[22:32] uh you stand when he sits in his throne
[22:36] Hallelujah
[22:38] you know a lot of people they are you
[22:41] know uh
[22:43] I wish I can I can go into the presence
[22:46] of God I wish I can stand before him
[22:48] but brothers and sisters one time
[22:52] Isaiah
[22:54] showed Isaiah a vision
[22:57] era Isaiah he he saw the Throne of God
[23:00] the temple of God
[23:03] and you know Isaiah he was the great
[23:06] prophet of God one of the of the Major
[23:09] Prophets earlier that God used to to
[23:12] write the Bible
[23:13] Hallelujah and he got ah I think if I'm
[23:17] not mistaken 66 books Hallelujah
[23:23] and
[23:24] God revealed to him a lot of things
[23:28] and maybe Isaiah you know in his days he
[23:32] was you know he was so confident
[23:34] you know maybe I am a holy man
[23:38] Hallelujah I am worthy because you know
[23:41] a lot of people among the people of
[23:44] Israel God is revealing to me
[23:48] Hallelujah and maybe the people who was
[23:51] admiring Isaiah oh Isaiah he's a good a
[23:55] great prophet of God
[23:57] you know he is a holy man
[24:00] but one day
[24:01] Hallelujah God showed him a vision
[24:06] and he saw the Throne of God
[24:09] Hallelujah and when he saw the Throne of
[24:12] God
[24:13] you know he realized he realized how
[24:17] unworthy he is
[24:19] that even he saw the seraphims and they
[24:23] have six wings and two Wings they used
[24:28] to cover their face
[24:29] Hallelujah ensures that even the
[24:32] seraphim that had no sin in them
[24:35] Hallelujah they are not worthy to look
[24:39] upon the throne of God
[24:41] Hallelujah they covered their faces
[24:45] and they have two wings and the two
[24:48] wings uh
[24:49] they covered their feet and barbraham
[24:52] said to shows reverence
[24:54] Hallelujah
[24:56] and then the two ways they use it
[24:59] to fly or for action
[25:02] Hallelujah and then when Isaiah saw
[25:05] these things
[25:07] he realized and he said
[25:10] Hallelujah
[25:11] imagine
[25:19] a prophet of God
[25:21] a holy man of God hallelujah
[25:24] when he saw how holy is God
[25:28] he said I am a man about unclean lips
[25:32] and I dwell in the midst of of a people
[25:35] about unclean lips and my eyes have seen
[25:40] the king the Lord of hosts
[25:43] that's how uh sacred that's how holy
[25:48] amen hallelujah that's how fearful
[25:51] Hallelujah
[25:53] when you stand before the presence of
[25:55] God
[25:56] and I believe brothers and sisters one
[25:58] day
[26:00] Hallelujah but I believe the bride will
[26:02] you know
[26:04] but
[26:05] the people one day everyone will stand
[26:08] before this Throne Hallelujah and
[26:12] everybody must prepare for that day
[26:17] hallelujah what judgment
[26:19] you will get Hallelujah we knew a prayer
[26:22] before his
[26:24] he's from
[26:25] you know one day
[26:27] when God God's Throne came down into
[26:31] Mount Sinai
[26:32] if you read The Exodus chapter 19 from
[26:36] 16 to 19 it says and it came to pass on
[26:40] the third day in the morning that there
[26:42] were Sanders and Lightnings and a thick
[26:46] Cloud upon the mount and the voice of
[26:48] the trumpet exceeding loud so that all
[26:51] the people that was in the camp trembled
[26:55] and Moses brought forth the people out
[26:58] of the come to meet with God and they
[27:00] stood at the nether part of the mount
[27:03] and Mount sinai's Sinai was greatly on a
[27:07] smoke all together on a smoke because
[27:11] the Lord descended upon it in Fire and
[27:14] the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
[27:17] of a furnace and the whole mount
[27:20] quick greatly
[27:23] Hallelujah imagine brothers and sisters
[27:26] that if you can imagine
[27:28] Mount Sinai it is a Rocky Mountain
[27:32] Allelujah and it says that even the
[27:34] mountain
[27:41] greatly yeah
[27:42] right even the mountain win win win God
[27:45] in his throne he touched that mountain
[27:48] Hallelujah even the mountain
[27:51] it showed
[27:52] Hallelujah
[27:54] and how much more
[27:56] we human beings
[27:58] and when the voice of the trumpet
[28:00] sounded long and works louder and louder
[28:03] Moses speak and God answered him by a
[28:06] voice
[28:07] and then
[28:09] now if we continue reading from this uh
[28:12] chapter chapter 19 and then from in in
[28:15] verse 20 from verse 1 up to 19 God he
[28:21] gave Hallelujah the Ten Commandments
[28:24] and then after giving the Ten
[28:26] Commandments after God speaking and
[28:28] writing Hallelujah those Ten
[28:30] Commandments Allelujah in verse 8 then
[28:33] it says and all the people saw the
[28:35] thunderings and the Lightnings and the
[28:38] noise of the trumpet and the mountains
[28:40] smoking and when the people saw it they
[28:44] removed and stood afaro amen and they
[28:48] said unto Moses speak thou with us and
[28:51] we will hear but let not God speak with
[28:54] us lest we die
[28:56] they were so scared be afraid Hallelujah
[28:59] they trembled hallelujah how fearful
[29:03] Hallelujah
[29:05] in their sight Hallelujah
[29:08] when they saw Hallelujah the presence of
[29:12] God
[29:13] when God hallelujah come down Allelujah
[29:16] us judge
[29:19] and then Paul's account in in the book
[29:22] of Hebrews chapter 12
[29:24] from Verse 18 to 21 he says for year not
[29:28] come unto the mount that might be
[29:30] touched
[29:32] and that burned with fire nor unto
[29:35] Blackness and darkness and Tempest and
[29:38] the sound of a trumpet and a voice over
[29:40] words of Words which voice they had
[29:43] heard entreated that the world should
[29:46] not be spoken to them anymore
[29:49] Hallelujah when God speaks
[29:52] Hallelujah it was so fearful Lord Moses
[29:56] allelia speak to us and now we will now
[29:59] hear you
[30:00] Hallelujah maybe before
[30:03] you know
[30:04] they just ignore Moses voice and they
[30:07] became Rebels Hallelujah but when they
[30:10] heard that Moses
[30:11] Hallelujah we will now hear you
[30:14] just don't let God speak to us we will
[30:17] die
[30:18] Hallelujah
[30:22] which was the uh that heard in written
[30:25] that the word should not be spoken to uh
[30:27] to them anymore for they could not
[30:30] endure that which was commanded and if
[30:33] so much as a beast touched the mountain
[30:36] it shall be stoned or thrust uh through
[30:40] with a DOT and so terrible was the sight
[30:43] that Moses said exceedingly
[30:46] fear and quick
[30:49] Hallelujah even Moses
[30:53] halleluia Evan Moses
[30:56] he was exceedingly fair and quick
[31:00] and even Joshua Hallelujah the great
[31:03] warrior
[31:04] he was the one who used by God to to
[31:07] bring the children of Israel into their
[31:10] inheritance and divided the land
[31:12] Hallelujah to its uh tribes
[31:16] and he could not even go up into the
[31:18] mountain he was just able to go halfway
[31:21] Hallelujah he could not come near
[31:25] into the presence of God
[31:28] Hallelujah
[31:33] it's so fearful brothers and sisters
[31:37] that
[31:38] even
[31:40] Moses was commanded to take to take
[31:43] officials Hallelujah
[31:45] this is a Holy Holy Ground Hallelujah
[31:49] and
[31:50] a judgment said nothing could stand
[31:54] there but only the redeem one day
[31:58] nothing Hallelujah a good standard
[32:01] only those that are Redeemed by the
[32:04] blood of Jesus Christ and sinner cannot
[32:07] approach Hallelujah that's judgment said
[32:10] Hallelujah and you know brothers and
[32:13] sisters one one
[32:16] ah
[32:19] the thing that we're rich
[32:21] out of the throne not only coming from a
[32:24] pharaoh but out of the throne from the
[32:27] throne
[32:29] Hallelujah
[32:30] proceeded Lightnings and thunderings and
[32:35] voices and in other scripture it says
[32:38] and sound of trumpets
[32:41] Hallelujah
[32:42] you know Brothers sometimes when we see
[32:45] this lightnings
[32:48] from a distance you know
[32:50] when we hear this uh great thundering
[32:54] sometimes we do like this
[32:56] we cannot endure Hallelujah we cannot
[32:59] bear Hallelujah the sound
[33:02] we cannot look on those Lightnings when
[33:05] even if it is a far off
[33:08] how much more brothers and sisters when
[33:10] you stand before the throne and the
[33:13] standings and Lightnings and voices are
[33:15] coming out Allelujah from that Throne if
[33:18] you can still stand
[33:20] Hallelujah a sinner could not stand
[33:24] hallelujah it's so fearful brothers and
[33:26] sisters to stand before God when he is
[33:31] when he sets us judge
[33:34] Hallelujah
[33:35] now
[33:37] it's
[33:40] but
[33:42] on the throne there is a way to approach
[33:46] Hallelujah
[33:50] and
[33:51] now
[33:52] Moses when he made the things in the
[33:56] Tabernacle
[33:58] ah here on Earth
[34:01] the things that he saw in heaven he
[34:03] patterned
[34:05] Hallelujah
[34:07] those things
[34:09] he patterned
[34:11] everything in that Tabernacle he
[34:13] patterned it to what he saw in heaven
[34:15] Hallelujah
[34:17] and in Hebrews chapter 8 verse 5 he says
[34:20] who served unto the example and Shadow
[34:23] of heavenly things as Moses was
[34:26] admonished of God when he was about to
[34:29] make that Tabernacle foresee saith he
[34:33] now that thou make all things according
[34:37] to the pattern showed today in the mount
[34:42] Hallelujah God
[34:44] showed to Moses what he is going to do
[34:48] Hallelujah and how to do and how to make
[34:51] and how to build and how to approach God
[34:53] Hallelujah in heaven and that's the
[34:56] thing how to approach Allelujah God when
[34:59] he sits in the holiest of holies
[35:03] so also Paul I believe when he wrote the
[35:06] book of Hebrews
[35:09] he said I know man
[35:12] I don't know if it is in the body or out
[35:16] of the body but he was you know he was
[35:18] talking to himself that he was caught up
[35:21] into the third heaven and I believe that
[35:24] God showed him what he saw in heaven is
[35:28] what Moses saw Hallelujah also in the
[35:32] vision and the same thing that God
[35:34] showed to John Hallelujah they saw the
[35:38] same things Moses Paul in in in in John
[35:41] in in the Book of Revelation now when
[35:45] Moses he he built that Tabernacle in the
[35:48] wilderness Allelujah and uh
[35:52] and how the people approach God
[35:56] Hallelujah when he was enthroned in the
[36:01] holiest of holies Hallelujah now
[36:05] they have uh there was uh there were
[36:08] three courts in it
[36:10] first is the outer Court
[36:13] and there the congregation they come
[36:15] under the blood Hallelujah because
[36:18] uh uh as Abraham said that God will not
[36:22] meet any worshiper
[36:25] except the blood Allelujah and then
[36:30] ah everybody was unclean
[36:35] Hallelujah but when a man is unclean
[36:39] unclean became unclean
[36:41] Hallelujah God had made a way for them
[36:44] to be clean
[36:45] Allelujah and no other than
[36:49] no other thing that could make them
[36:52] clean is
[36:53] through the waters of separation
[36:56] the Waters of Separation which is made
[36:59] out of a red Red River
[37:03] and they burned it and the ashes of it
[37:05] Allelujah is called the Waters of
[37:09] separation and when a man became unclean
[37:12] winner
[37:14] when a woman she delivered a child she
[37:19] became unclean and when a man touched a
[37:22] dead body she became unclean and could
[37:25] he could not enter into the congregation
[37:29] Hallelujah so there is a way
[37:32] of making him clean is by the sprinkling
[37:36] of the Waters of Separation then he can
[37:40] start Hallelujah to approach God
[37:43] halleluia in the outer court and no the
[37:49] red river which which was our sacrifice
[37:52] no other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:55] he was the word mid flesh and he was
[37:58] killed Hallelujah at Calvary he was the
[38:00] world Hallelujah and then in Ephesians
[38:04] chapter 5 verse 26 he says that that he
[38:08] might sanctify us see he might sanctify
[38:10] and cleanse it with the washing
[38:13] of Water by the world it is really the
[38:17] word that cleanses up cleanses us
[38:20] hallelujah and as we you know as I have
[38:24] said uh maybe if I have said it here
[38:27] that when we come to church it is not
[38:31] only to attend the service you know
[38:36] it is not only to fellowship with the
[38:38] brothers and sisters
[38:40] ah maybe the preacher is not a good
[38:43] preacher
[38:44] his English is you know
[38:47] you know but if it is the word of God
[38:50] Hallelujah when we are hearing the word
[38:53] we are God is really cleansing cleanses
[38:57] us
[38:58] Hallelujah it is a really cleanses at us
[39:01] hallelujah
[39:02] and in the outer God
[39:05] Hallelujah on the first court
[39:08] it is the place where the sinner comes
[39:11] and listen to the words
[39:14] to the word being preached
[39:16] Alleluia and that is the the first uh
[39:21] step to approach Hallelujah God
[39:25] and the first step is we have to come
[39:29] to God
[39:31] by faith and believing him
[39:33] and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[39:36] and hearing by the word of God
[39:38] hallelujah so in the outer Court
[39:42] there is the Brazil Altar and in there
[39:45] the sacrifices were offered Hallelujah
[39:50] and then
[39:52] from first uh chord and then the second
[39:57] is the holy place
[40:00] Hallelujah and in the Holy place
[40:03] not all the congregation become but only
[40:07] the priests Hallelujah
[40:10] and then
[40:11] on the third God
[40:13] is called the holiest of holies
[40:17] and in the holiest of holies there was
[40:21] the
[40:22] art of the Covenant
[40:25] and God dwells in there
[40:29] between the cherubim
[40:31] halleluia
[40:33] and God dwelt in that art of the kubinan
[40:37] or judgment said
[40:39] because when God is enthroned he is now
[40:45] judge mybraham said God when he is
[40:49] enthroned he is then a judge
[40:52] and because he is a judge when he is in
[40:55] drone there is no sinner could come in
[41:00] it is the art of the Covenant and it is
[41:03] the Judgment seat amen
[41:06] no sinner could come and stand before
[41:09] the Judgment seat of God
[41:12] but the problem brothers and sisters
[41:14] but the thing I mean is we are all
[41:17] sinners
[41:18] Hallelujah
[41:21] we are shaped in iniquity
[41:24] come to this world speaking lies and in
[41:27] sin did my mother conceive us
[41:30] by the sin of my mother and my father I
[41:33] am the product
[41:36] can you get
[41:38] a cleansing out of the unclean
[41:41] not one
[41:43] Hallelujah that's my brothers and
[41:45] sisters that even the high priest was a
[41:48] sinner
[41:49] Hallelujah if we read the Hebrews
[41:52] chapter 7 verse 27 when he go to offer
[41:56] Hallelujah before God
[41:59] to offer for the sin of the people first
[42:02] thing that he is go he that he does is
[42:04] Allelujah he says who need it not daily
[42:07] as those priests High priests to offer
[42:10] up sacrifices first for his own sins it
[42:14] means he himself is a sinner
[42:17] and then for the peoples Hallelujah
[42:21] for this did he uh he did once when he
[42:24] offered he of him of himself
[42:28] Hallelujah so
[42:30] even the high priest was a sinner
[42:34] Allelujah that's why brothers and
[42:37] sisters win when he entered Beyond
[42:41] behind the veil
[42:44] he is not even sure if he will
[42:47] die or will come up come back alive
[42:50] Hallelujah
[42:53] he is not sure no
[42:55] and if he will die
[42:59] God it means that God did not receive
[43:02] the offering of all the congregation of
[43:05] Israel
[43:06] he represents the people of Israel
[43:09] so because he is not sure that if he
[43:13] will if he will live or he will die then
[43:16] they put him up they tied him a rope on
[43:19] his leg
[43:21] so in case when he enter into the
[43:25] holiest of holies in case he dies
[43:29] then
[43:31] if the high priest died how much more
[43:34] the ordinary person amen that will
[43:38] get in to the holiest of holies to get
[43:40] the body and he will also die that's why
[43:43] they put a
[43:45] they tied a rope a rope in his leg and
[43:48] then we will just pull the Rope to get
[43:51] his body out of the
[43:53] holiest of holies
[43:55] Hallelujah
[43:56] but brothers and sisters
[43:59] thank be to God
[44:03] he had a remedy
[44:05] Hallelujah
[44:08] the Judgment said that nobody could
[44:11] stand
[44:12] if the high priest will just go there
[44:16] having blood having blood with him
[44:19] Hallelujah and then when he sprinkled
[44:22] that blood into the Judgment seat then
[44:26] it became a mercy seat amen
[44:30] Hallelujah you will find Mercy when you
[44:33] go there and you have you accepted you
[44:36] have the blood Hallelujah with you
[44:39] Hallelujah that judgment said
[44:42] will became will become a mercy seat for
[44:46] you that's why brothers and sisters the
[44:48] only thing that we can come before God
[44:51] is to accept the blood of Jesus Christ
[44:54] not only the blood of the animal but the
[44:56] blood of Jesus Christ we need to accept
[44:59] it Hallelujah
[45:01] we cannot stand without the blood of
[45:03] Jesus Christ
[45:05] and when God
[45:07] ah
[45:09] see the blood
[45:11] because God's uh
[45:13] law is the day you eat the day you die
[45:18] means
[45:19] the day you sin I will require the life
[45:23] amen and the Bible says that life is in
[45:26] the blood
[45:27] and when God when he see a blood it
[45:30] means there is a life that was being
[45:33] shed
[45:34] it means the penalty of death was had
[45:38] been paid amen amen hallelujah so
[45:42] once I in a year
[45:45] the high priest
[45:46] ah can go there once a year with blood
[45:52] Allelujah and he must have blood with
[45:54] him to sprinkle on the Judgment seat in
[45:57] order for it to be
[45:59] to become a mercy seat
[46:02] and not only
[46:07] blood
[46:09] but the high priest
[46:11] could not get in
[46:14] could not get into that place with his
[46:17] ordinary clothing
[46:20] Allelujah
[46:22] he needed
[46:23] to be dressed in a certain way
[46:28] a certain garment yeah that's right
[46:31] a garment that according to the design
[46:34] that God showed to them
[46:37] Hallelujah
[46:39] so brothers and sisters that's why maybe
[46:41] some of the newcomers
[46:45] you know the unbelievers
[46:48] are wondering why why these Believers
[46:51] are you know are are dressed like this
[46:55] Allelujah you know
[47:00] God
[47:02] he was the one God was the one who
[47:04] designed a dress for the believer
[47:07] Hallelujah you know brothers and sisters
[47:13] uh
[47:15] who are the who are the top
[47:18] fashion designer of the world
[47:25] most of them
[47:28] are perverted ones perverted people
[47:32] and where the anointing of these
[47:35] perverted people come amen
[47:38] Hallelujah and sometimes believers they
[47:42] get Envy
[47:44] to how that the world is dressed
[47:49] but thank be to God hallelujah we have
[47:53] a designer
[47:54] Hallelujah
[47:57] and without obeying the design of God
[48:01] for
[48:04] his people to be dressed
[48:06] you cannot
[48:08] come before his presence
[48:12] so the high priest in order for him to
[48:15] come in not only for him to have the
[48:18] blood but he needs us also to be dressed
[48:22] in a certain way
[48:24] Hallelujah to be dressed in a certain
[48:26] way
[48:27] and then in the hand of his dress Abyss
[48:32] garment
[48:33] their hungs
[48:35] a bell a pomegranate a bell a
[48:39] pomegranate
[48:40] Hallelujah
[48:42] and
[48:43] I believe that even if there are bells
[48:46] and pomegranate on the Hema business
[48:50] government if he will just walk an
[48:52] ordinary walk
[48:54] he's usually or walk it will not create
[48:57] a sound
[49:00] Hallelujah
[49:01] but when he maybe he his ordinary work
[49:07] his daily walk
[49:09] he is used to it but when he comes
[49:12] inside and stand Allelujah before the
[49:16] presence of God he must have to walk
[49:18] different a different work
[49:20] not this ah not uh not his ordinary work
[49:25] but a different book
[49:27] because the bells and pomegranate will
[49:30] will will create a sound it needs to
[49:33] Struck One each other and so that it
[49:36] will create a sound and will say and
[49:38] will cry holy holy holy unto the Lord
[49:43] Hallelujah
[49:45] it means brothers and sisters if you
[49:47] want to come before the presence of God
[49:49] and we believe brothers sisters that
[49:53] in the presence of God there is life
[49:57] Hallelujah outside the presence of God
[50:00] is death
[50:01] you remember brothers and sisters
[50:07] that was already dried a dried stick
[50:11] he had been maybe he had been using it
[50:14] for years and years and it's also
[50:16] already dried but when
[50:19] they put it in the presence of God in
[50:23] the ark of the kubernan it blossoms
[50:26] Hallelujah
[50:27] and even the the the Mana
[50:31] that will only last a day
[50:34] and if you will get Mana today you will
[50:37] pick those Mana today and then keep it
[50:41] until tomorrow
[50:43] one day Hallelujah there was an
[50:45] Israelite he kept
[50:48] from those Manas and when
[50:51] the look at it the next day it's already
[50:54] there were worms on it
[50:57] it will rock it will be spoiled
[51:00] Hallelujah but when they put this manner
[51:04] and they call it the hidden Manna when
[51:07] they put it inside in the presence of
[51:09] God in inside that box
[51:13] that ah
[51:15] Arc of the Covenant
[51:18] it was in the spoil
[51:20] for years and for years and four years
[51:22] why because in the presence of God there
[51:25] is life
[51:27] Hallelujah and brothers and sisters if
[51:30] you want Hallelujah
[51:32] do you have life
[51:34] Allelujah you need to come before his
[51:37] presence you need to come Hallelujah but
[51:40] you cannot come with your ordinary walk
[51:44] you cannot come with your you know
[51:47] with the
[51:49] with the dress we are dressing
[51:52] with
[51:53] the grace of the world
[51:55] Hallelujah you need to come according
[51:58] Hallelujah to his design
[52:01] Hallelujah and another thing brothers
[52:03] and sisters
[52:05] the high priest could not come unless he
[52:09] is Anointed
[52:11] with an anointing ointment or ointment I
[52:15] mean
[52:16] Hallelujah from The Rose of Sharon
[52:19] halleluia and who is the rose of Sharon
[52:22] no other than the Lord Jesus Christ

[52:27] Hallelujah and in order for the rose of
[52:30] Sharon to be an anointing ointment
[52:33] to have the fragrance of it will the
[52:37] fragrance
[52:39] will be the fragrance of the high priest
[52:41] when he get in into the holiest of
[52:45] holies
[52:46] that Rose of Sharon must be crushed
[52:48] Hallelujah in order for the fragrance to
[52:51] come out
[52:52] and the fragrance Hallelujah will be
[52:57] the fragrance of the
[52:59] amen the high priest will smell

[53:36] and there is no other
[53:39] Hallelujah
[53:42] the most beautiful life that was
[53:44] displayed here on Earth
[53:46] is the life of Jesus Christ
[53:49] and he was crossed at the cross of
[53:52] calvary
[53:53] and Barbara Braham said Hallelujah when
[53:56] they crossed Jesus Christ at Calvary
[53:58] they killed him
[54:00] they struck him on his side with that
[54:03] Roman spear
[54:04] and the blood came out
[54:06] and when the blood came out of him the
[54:09] life also came out with the blood
[54:12] Hallelujah and God set the body on the
[54:16] right hand of God but
[54:19] he sent Hallelujah that life into the
[54:24] 120
[54:25] at the day on the day of Pentecost
[54:28] and Peter said Allelujah that this
[54:31] promise this is the promise Hallelujah
[54:36] this is what Joel had spoken
[54:41] this is what God had promised
[54:44] and This Promise is not only for us not
[54:47] only for you but to your children and
[54:49] your children Hallelujah
[54:51] as many as God will call

[54:58] that this fragrance that this kind of
[55:01] Life Alleluia is promised to them that

[56:42] in his throne in that Tabernacle of
[56:45] Moses
[56:47] Hallelujah
[56:48] then he moved birbraham said he moved
[56:51] into another Tabernacle
[56:53] which was
[56:55] the body of Jesus Christ
[56:57] the Bible says in second Corinthians
[56:59] chapter 5 verse 19 19 God was in Christ
[57:03] reconciling the world to himself
[57:05] Colossians 2 9 for all the fullness and
[57:08] the godhead bill is in him badly
[57:11] Hallelujah so
[57:14] done
[57:18] the seat of God
[57:19] Hallelujah is now in that body in that
[57:23] another Tabernacle
[57:25] but when Jesus died Hallelujah at the
[57:29] cross
[57:31] the temple
[57:33] the will
[57:35] of the temple was rent
[57:38] Hallelujah
[57:40] before it was only the high priest can
[57:44] get in
[57:46] but God he made a way Hallelujah it was
[57:50] the veil was rent not from the bottom
[57:54] to top but
[57:56] it was rent from top to bottom it means
[58:01] it was not the deed of a man
[58:04] it was God who did it Allelujah who made
[58:07] a way
[58:08] Hallelujah
[58:11] that it means not only the high priest
[58:14] now could come in but whosoever will
[58:17] Hallelujah and the priest he could only
[58:21] he was only the one who could have that
[58:24] anointing of the Shekinah Glory
[58:27] and walk a holy life
[58:31] she walked Hallelujah
[58:34] before
[58:36] the presence of God
[58:38] it Cries Holy Holy unto the Lord
[58:41] but this time when the veil was ran
[58:46] whosoever will
[58:47] could come in and walk a holy life and
[58:51] your life will cry out holy holy unto
[58:54] the Lord hallelujah
[58:56] now
[58:58] when Moses built that Tabernacle
[59:01] although inside there was a veil but it
[59:06] was built with the covering of an animal
[59:10] skin
[59:12] so imagine
[59:14] what maybe he was you know some people
[59:17] will have this question
[59:21] he he was he is God and why he did not
[59:24] belt with you know with the precious
[59:28] wood or pure gold but why did he
[59:37] animal skin
[59:40] because
[59:41] Paul said that everything in the Old
[59:45] Testament
[59:46] are shadows Hallelujah of the good
[59:50] things to come which was the Lord which
[59:53] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:55] it was it means the the Shekinah Glory
[1:00:00] covered with animal skin it only speaks
[1:00:03] that one day the Shekinah Glory of God
[1:00:06] will be covered with a human skin
[1:00:14] the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hebrews
[1:00:18] chapter 10 19-22 having therefore
[1:00:20] Brethren boldness to enter into the
[1:00:22] holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New
[1:00:25] and Living Way which he had consecrated
[1:00:28] for us through the veil that is to say
[1:00:31] his flesh
[1:00:34] Hallelujah
[1:00:36] and having an high priest over the house
[1:00:39] of God let us draw near with a True
[1:00:41] Heart
[1:00:42] in full Assurance of Faith having our
[1:00:45] hearts sprinkled from an unable
[1:00:47] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:00:50] pure water
[1:00:52] Hallelujah now
[1:00:54] that is to say his flesh it means
[1:00:59] literally the Valley of the temple was
[1:01:02] written
[1:01:04] and everybody can get in do whosoever
[1:01:07] will
[1:01:08] but what God is showing Hallelujah the
[1:01:11] real thing is the body of Jesus Christ
[1:01:13] was his place was the one was being rent
[1:01:17] Allelujah
[1:01:19] in order Hallelujah for the life
[1:01:22] for the throne that was in him
[1:01:25] Hallelujah so we can
[1:01:27] he says hallelujah
[1:01:31] let us come boldly
[1:01:34] boldness
[1:01:36] having therefore Brethren boldness to
[1:01:38] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:01:42] Jesus Christ by renting the body of
[1:01:45] Jesus Christ and we have now the access
[1:01:48] to Fellowship Hallelujah
[1:01:51] into his presence
[1:01:54] amen hallelujah so
[1:01:57] in the oldest cement it was only the
[1:02:00] high priest
[1:02:01] couldn't tear into the holiest of holies
[1:02:04] Hallelujah but he must be you know
[1:02:09] he was the only one
[1:02:12] imagine brothers and sisters millions of
[1:02:14] them
[1:02:17] Israelites and only one who is
[1:02:21] maybe the world will say he was so lucky
[1:02:24] but we can say he was a blessed
[1:02:27] person
[1:02:29] because he he was the only one could
[1:02:32] come in and fellowship with the Shekinah
[1:02:34] Glory of God and even David one time I
[1:02:37] remembered he says he said one thing
[1:02:40] have I desire of the Lord that I seek
[1:02:42] after
[1:02:44] he was not a priest
[1:02:46] no he was not unhypressed that I seek
[1:02:49] after that I may dwell in the house of
[1:02:51] the Lord
[1:02:52] all the days of my life
[1:02:54] Hallelujah
[1:02:56] to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:03:00] that was his desire amen
[1:03:03] Imagine David he was you know longing he
[1:03:08] was Desiring to fellowship with that
[1:03:10] presence to behold the beauty of the
[1:03:12] Lord
[1:03:13] Hallelujah
[1:03:15] imagine brothers and sisters there was
[1:03:17] no electricity electricity there there
[1:03:19] was no ah lamb stand inside that and yet
[1:03:24] it was
[1:03:28] light there was light in it
[1:03:31] so what kind of light
[1:03:34] it was from the Shekinah the glory of
[1:03:36] the Lord
[1:03:37] and everybody was longing everybody was
[1:03:40] deciding Hallelujah to see
[1:03:44] but brothers and sisters God had made a
[1:03:47] wave for every one of us to come and to
[1:03:51] see that beauty that Shekinah Glory we
[1:03:55] were given the chance if you only
[1:03:58] Hallelujah one right to come before him
[1:04:02] and you know brothers and sisters
[1:04:04] the high priest he must be a special
[1:04:07] person
[1:04:10] but Jim brothers and sisters not every
[1:04:12] American was given
[1:04:15] a chance to be the president president
[1:04:17] of the United States
[1:04:20] right and maybe we are not longing for
[1:04:22] it because it is a position that you
[1:04:24] know for the world
[1:04:26] but the worldly people they are spending
[1:04:29] maybe millions in the Philippines
[1:04:32] spending billions of pesos in just in
[1:04:35] order you know for him to be
[1:04:37] just a mayor to be a mayor or to be a
[1:04:40] governor
[1:04:41] Hallelujah and now this is not only a
[1:04:44] president but to come before the
[1:04:47] presence of God
[1:04:49] he must be a special purple person that
[1:04:52] maybe all the people must invade
[1:04:55] oh how lucky he is how blessed he is
[1:04:59] my brothers and sisters
[1:05:02] I tell you this evening that how blessed
[1:05:05] we are
[1:05:06] that God made a way for every one of us
[1:05:08] to come before his presence the
[1:05:10] fellowship with the Shekinah Glory
[1:05:13] all right but sometimes the problem is
[1:05:17] instead
[1:05:18] of the worldly people the people of the
[1:05:22] world get
[1:05:24] Envy on us
[1:05:26] sometimes Christians especially young
[1:05:28] people they get Envy with the world
[1:05:31] how they walk how they do how they talk
[1:05:34] how you know how they dress
[1:05:36] no brothers and sisters
[1:05:39] We Are The Most Blessed people
[1:05:43] and should not invade with the world
[1:05:45] Amen they must be the one to invade
[1:05:47] Hallelujah on us
[1:05:52] Hallelujah
[1:05:53] in our behavior in our daily work
[1:05:57] Hallelujah will always cry unto the Lord
[1:06:00] holy holy holy and to the Lord
[1:06:04] Hallelujah and our Behavior will smell
[1:06:08] Hallelujah Jesus Christ
[1:06:12] will smell the odor must must be smelled
[1:06:16] Allelujah will you know
[1:06:19] I don't know how to say it they say I
[1:06:22] don't know what's the exact word
[1:06:24] Hallelujah
[1:06:31] now
[1:06:33] then the Shekinah Glory
[1:06:35] rest from that Mercy Seat
[1:06:37] versus it one day and settled into
[1:06:40] another Tabernacle
[1:06:43] which is the body of Jesus Christ
[1:06:45] and then that body of Jesus Christ
[1:06:49] Hallelujah
[1:06:51] were
[1:06:54] the Shekinah Glory of God settled
[1:06:57] it becomes supposedly it becomes the
[1:07:02] Judgment seat
[1:07:04] in his son
[1:07:05] Alleluia John Chapter 5 Verse 22 it says
[1:07:09] for The Father judges Newman but had
[1:07:13] committed all judgment unto the son
[1:07:16] so now
[1:07:20] it is not the father that will be do the
[1:07:24] judging but he committed all the
[1:07:27] Judgment all judgment into the son
[1:07:31] he became now the Judgment seat
[1:07:35] but the thing is
[1:07:37] the reason Jesus could not judge anyone
[1:07:42] Hallelujah at the time
[1:07:44] because the Judgment said the Throne of
[1:07:47] God was inside of him
[1:07:50] but the thing is the Judgment said was
[1:07:54] loved with the blood
[1:07:57] Hallelujah he was the blood of God
[1:08:00] created in the womb of Mary
[1:08:02] Hallelujah that's why the judgments it
[1:08:05] became
[1:08:07] amen
[1:08:09] amen hallelujah all the people did Evil
[1:08:12] things unto him persecuted him killed
[1:08:14] him but
[1:08:16] only saying that he that without his
[1:08:19] father forgive them for they know not
[1:08:21] what they do
[1:08:24] it became Mercy
[1:08:27] instead of judgment
[1:08:31] but
[1:08:32] God
[1:08:35] he speaks on another mercy seat or
[1:08:37] another judgment said
[1:08:39] another Tabernacle coming
[1:08:44] in Matthew chapter 12 verse 32 he says
[1:08:47] and whosoever is speaketh a word against
[1:08:49] the son of man
[1:08:51] it shall be forgiven him
[1:08:54] but whosoever whoever speaketh against
[1:08:56] the Holy Ghost
[1:08:57] it shall not be for
[1:09:01] before his word neither in the world to
[1:09:04] come
[1:09:06] what is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:08] Hallelujah
[1:09:10] it is not a different person
[1:09:13] Hallelujah because if the Holy Ghost is
[1:09:16] different from the father
[1:09:19] and the Bible said in Matthew chapter 1
[1:09:22] verse 8 and that
[1:09:24] when the angel spoke to Joseph in a
[1:09:27] dream he says that she was found a child
[1:09:30] with the Holy Ghost it means
[1:09:32] the father of the child is the Holy
[1:09:35] Ghost amen and then Jesus said he got
[1:09:37] the father
[1:09:38] so if the father and the Holy Ghost are
[1:09:40] too different
[1:09:42] person then Jesus had two fathers and
[1:09:45] Barbarian said that then we have a an
[1:09:48] illegitimate
[1:09:50] savior
[1:09:52] but the Holy Ghost is God himself but
[1:09:56] what is the Holy Ghost yes it is the
[1:09:58] spirit of God in the Believers
[1:10:01] when the spirit of God come into the
[1:10:04] Believers it's called the Holy Ghost
[1:10:07] Hallelujah
[1:10:08] what is the Holy Ghost uh in the in the
[1:10:11] message what is the Holy Ghost who is
[1:10:13] Barbara and said who is that Spirit then
[1:10:16] what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in
[1:10:19] your the comforter that's the Holy
[1:10:22] Spirit
[1:10:23] another quotation what is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:26] uh Mrs what is the Holy Ghost nah
[1:10:30] what was the Holy Ghost given for he
[1:10:33] says what is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:35] God in you
[1:10:38] amen God in you Hallelujah so from the
[1:10:42] Tabernacle in Moses he moved into one
[1:10:45] body and then from that one body he
[1:10:48] moved into many member body into the
[1:10:52] Believers and it is called the Holy
[1:10:54] Ghost
[1:10:57] Mary's belief he says but when he was
[1:11:03] but then he was is in one person
[1:11:08] Hallelujah all that God was battled
[1:11:12] up into one man Jesus Christ
[1:11:16] but in this time he's Across the
[1:11:18] Universe in his church doing more of it
[1:11:22] the same works
[1:11:24] so it was from Tabernacle he moved into
[1:11:28] another Tabernacle and then he moved
[1:11:31] into another Tabernacle and Paul said
[1:11:33] knowing at that year the temple of God
[1:11:35] and that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:11:38] you
[1:11:39] and then he says if then Paul said If
[1:11:43] any man destroyed that Temple
[1:11:48] he got to answer God
[1:11:50] that's why ah Jesus said whosoever is
[1:11:54] speaking award against the son of man it
[1:11:57] shall be forgiven him but whosoever
[1:11:59] speak it against the Holy Ghost where
[1:12:02] the Holy Ghost is in The Believer
[1:12:05] whosoever speaketh Hallelujah to the
[1:12:08] Believers
[1:12:09] it shall not be forgiven him neither in
[1:12:12] this world neither in the world to come
[1:12:16] that's
[1:12:18] oh
[1:12:21] Hallelujah
[1:12:23] and sometimes you know people it it is
[1:12:26] easy for them to say bad words against
[1:12:28] the Believers Hallelujah
[1:12:31] say evil Things No Evil things
[1:12:34] but they don't realize brother what they
[1:12:37] are doing
[1:12:38] maybe you cannot we cannot judge them
[1:12:43] now
[1:12:45] why
[1:12:46] because we have that same spirit
[1:12:49] Hallelujah that was in Christ
[1:12:51] so I one one time
[1:12:54] in Birmingham he said
[1:12:56] when when you open the the fifth seal
[1:12:59] and then
[1:13:01] the Bible says that this Souls under the
[1:13:04] altar
[1:13:05] and then said
[1:13:07] who are they
[1:13:10] Hallelujah he said that they are Jews
[1:13:13] because Lord how long will you avenge
[1:13:18] how long will you you know
[1:13:21] will you judge them
[1:13:24] everyone said they are not
[1:13:27] Christians no because if they were
[1:13:30] Christians they have the spirit of
[1:13:33] Christ and if we have the spirit of
[1:13:35] Christ what Christ did
[1:13:37] they will also know
[1:13:39] hallelujah what Christ did they said
[1:13:41] that he did not say against them he said
[1:13:45] father forgive them
[1:13:47] but brothers and sisters what they did
[1:13:49] to us God will never
[1:13:52] forget it
[1:13:54] what the people did to a believer
[1:13:57] who is the temple
[1:13:59] Allelujah
[1:14:02] God will not forget it
[1:14:06] you know one one time it says in the
[1:14:09] Bible that even if you will give a glass
[1:14:13] of water
[1:14:14] Hallelujah God will into a believer in
[1:14:18] the name Hallelujah
[1:14:19] of Jesus Christ
[1:14:21] it will not be for forgotten
[1:14:24] there is a reward
[1:14:26] Hallelujah but
[1:14:28] when you do something to believer maybe
[1:14:31] the believer will not you know
[1:14:33] judge you at this time but there is
[1:14:36] someone
[1:14:37] halleluia who will not forget it
[1:14:42] if you speak against the son of man it
[1:14:44] will be forgiven but
[1:14:46] when you speak against the Holy Ghost
[1:14:49] it will not be forgiven even this world
[1:14:52] or in the world to come
[1:14:55] that's why brothers and sisters
[1:14:56] we should know hallelujah how to treat
[1:14:59] each other even your Believers you know
[1:15:02] you should have respect each other
[1:15:03] especially to the
[1:15:06] Hallelujah
[1:15:07] especially to the to the ministers I'm
[1:15:10] not seeing this because I am a minister
[1:15:13] but you have to respect Hallelujah the
[1:15:16] Elders of this church of this church
[1:15:18] Hallelujah
[1:15:20] Barbara I'm sitting
[1:15:23] as we sin them now that was God's throne
[1:15:27] in heaven Moses spotted it
[1:15:30] on Earth
[1:15:32] was God strong because his judgment seat
[1:15:36] was present represented here
[1:15:39] on Earth in the holy of holy
[1:15:42] all Israel
[1:15:45] come to that one place to find Mercy
[1:15:49] because God only met under the shed
[1:15:53] blood
[1:15:54] now listen close then the Shekinah Glory
[1:15:57] raised from that Mercy Seat one day and
[1:16:01] it settled on another Tabernacle amen
[1:16:04] this one The Father judges new man but
[1:16:07] he's committed all judgment to the son
[1:16:10] God's judgment seat Hallelujah you speak
[1:16:14] against me it will be forgiven you speak
[1:16:17] another one another another one coming
[1:16:20] another Mercy Seat you speak against the
[1:16:23] son of man I will forgive you but
[1:16:25] someday the holy spirit will come to
[1:16:28] dwell in the hearts of the people one
[1:16:32] word against it will never be forgiven
[1:16:38] so as I have said what is the Holy Ghost
[1:16:41] it is the holy spirit that dwell
[1:16:44] that will come to dwell in the human
[1:16:47] heart
[1:16:48] Hallelujah of his people one word
[1:16:51] against it will never be forgiven
[1:16:53] Hallelujah
[1:16:55] now another quotation
[1:17:01] it keeps getting more severe and more
[1:17:04] severe all the time
[1:17:06] the judgment
[1:17:08] caused God's continually wearing his
[1:17:11] patients out trying to get Sinners to
[1:17:14] come to him to be reconciled
[1:17:17] first he was in the heavens above and
[1:17:21] shining in the stars the second he was
[1:17:25] on Earth shining through the Shekinah
[1:17:27] Glory next he come and was made flesh
[1:17:31] and dwelt Among Us still wearing his
[1:17:34] patience
[1:17:36] then he redeemed Man by his blood came
[1:17:41] into his church in the form of the Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost and speak against that it's a
[1:17:48] finished thing
[1:17:49] done
[1:17:51] now you can see where the shaking come
[1:17:54] we are at the time didn't realize people
[1:17:58] can't comprehend what it means
[1:18:00] and he says
[1:18:02] and when you walk through that when he
[1:18:06] goes into the heart and there's where
[1:18:09] his his throne
[1:18:11] does the Holy Spirit In You
[1:18:14] Jesus said it will be better if far
[1:18:18] better that a millstone was hung at your
[1:18:21] neck
[1:18:21] and you was drawn in the depths of the
[1:18:24] sea done to even offend one of these
[1:18:28] little ones that believe in me
[1:18:31] not do them any harm
[1:18:34] just even to bring offense to them oh
[1:18:37] brother sisters how
[1:18:40] how dangerous
[1:18:42] Hallelujah just to bring an offense to
[1:18:45] them just upset them about something
[1:18:49] and be better that you had your own self
[1:18:54] drawn
[1:18:55] or had never been born on the Earth
[1:18:58] than even to bring an offense to one
[1:19:03] did he mean it
[1:19:05] could he lie
[1:19:07] did Apostles say it
[1:19:10] no it was not the teaching of the
[1:19:12] apostle
[1:19:13] Hallelujah no Jesus said it Jesus
[1:19:16] himself said it Jesus said if you even
[1:19:21] bring an offense to one of them these
[1:19:24] little ones had that believe in me
[1:19:29] so
[1:19:31] Hallelujah
[1:19:35] and then
[1:19:37] I believe brothers and sisters that
[1:19:40] every one of us especially we
[1:19:43] the Believers
[1:19:45] the message believers
[1:19:48] Hallelujah
[1:19:50] and everybody
[1:19:54] says that uh
[1:19:57] we claim this that I am the dwelling
[1:20:00] place of God I am one of that Hallelujah
[1:20:03] Tabernacle
[1:20:05] I have the Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] but remember that wherever the Throne of
[1:20:10] God is
[1:20:12] it becomes a judgment seat
[1:20:15] either it was on in heaven it was in the
[1:20:19] Tabernacle it was in Jesus it was in the
[1:20:22] Believers but once God sits in that room
[1:20:27] he is
[1:20:29] judge
[1:20:31] last quotation that I'm going to read he
[1:20:34] says you say I can tell dirty jokes
[1:20:38] I don't
[1:20:39] it don't condemn me
[1:20:41] why the end got nothing it
[1:20:44] can condemn
[1:20:46] no one's there to take it out
[1:20:49] no no one's there to condemn you
[1:20:54] well I tell you the woman say I can have
[1:20:58] short hair it don't condemn me no wonder
[1:21:01] see oh I can worship I can do this the
[1:21:06] man said it don't hurt me to smoke
[1:21:09] cigars and it don't hurt me to play some
[1:21:12] cards and shoot some dice and whatever
[1:21:15] they do it don't hurt me and this still
[1:21:19] belong to the church see don't hurt me
[1:21:21] to do this why there's nothing there to
[1:21:25] judge you
[1:21:27] but when Christ comes in
[1:21:30] you've created an altar on your heart
[1:21:33] and your sins are taken daily
[1:21:38] the great Saint Paul he said I Die daily
[1:21:41] nevertheless I live but not me leave
[1:21:44] Christ live in me there's the inner will
[1:21:49] brothers and sisters because that's why
[1:21:52] John said Apostle John said that
[1:21:55] we in your heart
[1:21:57] condemns you
[1:21:59] it means there is something that judges
[1:22:03] you
[1:22:04] Hallelujah
[1:22:06] when Christ is really in your heart and
[1:22:09] he is sitting there as a judge every
[1:22:12] time you do this and it is not
[1:22:16] halleluia pleasing before God then God
[1:22:18] will judge you
[1:22:20] and then that's why oh Lord forgive me I
[1:22:24] Repent Lord
[1:22:25] because why because there is someone
[1:22:29] that judging you
[1:22:30] but you know
[1:22:37] if you only
[1:22:40] if there is something
[1:22:42] if there is nobody no one judging you
[1:22:45] when you are doing wrong it means there
[1:22:47] is no judge
[1:22:49] sitting in there
[1:22:51] but brothers and sisters all I can say
[1:22:54] is what I can say is God had already
[1:22:57] opened
[1:22:59] he rented the bill
[1:23:01] Hallelujah he already had rent The Bell
[1:23:04] the bill
[1:23:06] will
[1:23:09] have the desire
[1:23:11] to come in and fellowship
[1:23:14] with him whosoever will
[1:23:18] God will grant your desire if you're
[1:23:21] really sincere to invite Jesus Christ to
[1:23:24] come in Lord
[1:23:26] Hallelujah come into my heart you know
[1:23:29] because God he is a gentle God
[1:23:32] he will not interfere in one's life
[1:23:35] unless you permit him to come
[1:23:38] that's why he can do you know he can
[1:23:42] control everybody
[1:23:44] but
[1:23:46] the Bible says that that's why the Bible
[1:23:48] says he is knocking Hallelujah
[1:23:53] and if you will just open your heart and
[1:23:56] you are sincere Lord please come in and
[1:24:00] let my heart
[1:24:01] be yours from
[1:24:03] Hallelujah
[1:24:12] and he will come in
[1:24:15] Hallelujah so
[1:24:18] I believe I hope this this message this
[1:24:22] is just a short message and I hope this
[1:24:27] uh will be a blessing to everyone
[1:24:29] and uh
