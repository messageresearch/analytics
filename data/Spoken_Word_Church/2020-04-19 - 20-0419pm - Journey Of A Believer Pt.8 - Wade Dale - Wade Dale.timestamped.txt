[1:13] Thank You Warren pour out your power and
[1:18] love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy
[1:29] holy you are holy holy holy yes your
[1:38] holy holy holy I want to see you name an
[1:48] gonna be in the house of the Lord again
[1:49] couldn't have each and every one of you
[1:51] here that are here the ones out in the
[1:54] parking lot the faithful make a few
[1:59] announcements here before we get started
[2:00] number one from the Bob will be speaking
[2:03] Wednesday night so let's pray for him
[2:06] also remember brother Joel Forney he is
[2:10] recovering there in Charlotte and with
[2:14] this coronavirus and all this stuff
[2:15] he's up there by self sister Vanessa
[2:18] can't be with him are the girls or his
[2:20] son they can't be with him so their face
[2:24] time timing with him and that's about it
[2:27] so we just need to pray that - that's
[2:30] the Lord will send His blessings up to
[2:33] her brother jewel I know I don't like
[2:37] what the devil is doing to all these
[2:38] preachers around the message I just
[2:40] don't like that I don't like it at all
[2:42] so we need to strive more and more to be
[2:46] able to pray for those ones because if
[2:48] Satan knows if he can get the ministry
[2:50] then he's got the people so we we just
[2:53] pray that and the ones he's been picking
[2:55] on or the fighters there's one that will
[2:57] fight him him brother dying brother runs
[3:00] answer but Homer different ones you know
[3:02] so we pray that God will just restore
[3:04] them to get help also it was it was
[3:08] clear in the text message but maybe all
[3:10] of you didn't get the text message well
[3:13] do not send tithe money to the church
[3:16] address that was not on the ties list so
[3:20] it really shouldn't have been done but
[3:22] some people are doing that but please
[3:23] the church does not have a pill box or a
[3:27] mail box
[3:29] I just happened to be friends with the
[3:32] guy in Lula that keeps telling me that
[3:34] there's checks popping up up there and
[3:36] that's a Lula this is a Lula address so
[3:38] you need to send your tithes checks to
[3:41] brother Terrence Dale's address and I'm
[3:44] not gonna announce it online you can get
[3:47] it somehow somewhere it's on the text
[3:50] message it's on your list of church
[3:55] people addresses so send the tithes
[3:58] money to brother Terrence nails address
[4:02] in Gil's Bell Georgia okay because we
[4:06] don't we don't want to mix up and we
[4:08] know that if you send it and they send
[4:09] to have to send it back we call it
[4:13] return to sender or insufficient address
[4:17] or whatever it is it has to go back to
[4:18] North Metro and in North Metro has to
[4:21] send it sometimes but Terrence said he
[4:25] got most of it right you got most of it
[4:27] and I had one that was delivered to me
[4:29] at my house cuz I knew the man and then
[4:31] we took it to Terrence his house so just
[4:34] remember that do not send tithe to the
[4:37] church address we have know physically
[4:39] have a physical address everybody has to
[4:41] have a physical address because the
[4:42] 9-1-1 but you don't have to have a
[4:46] mailbox or a pillbox number so and we do
[4:48] not hear to church so send them to
[4:49] brother Terrence also when we I know
[4:55] there's there's not many here today that
[4:58] was here this morning but I want to make
[4:59] an announcement if you're not going to
[5:01] be at both services please let me know
[5:06] because if you're not then I can find
[5:11] somebody else to take your place it
[5:13] wants to come
[5:13] and man and if they want to come both
[5:16] services I may just cancel you out and
[5:18] let the people that's come in both
[5:20] services because the people that want to
[5:21] be here want to be here and not just to
[5:25] say well I'm coming for a service Sunday
[5:27] morning and I'm going back home Church
[5:30] had changed we're required to be at two
[5:33] services on Sunday I don't some people
[5:36] maybe make their own rules but but not
[5:38] to be mean I just want to tell you if
[5:39] you're not gonna be here to services let
[5:42] me know cuz I can have somebody else
[5:46] come in brother Danny fountain some of
[5:47] the different ones that wants to come
[5:49] they couldn't come because I thought you
[5:51] were gonna be here both services so if
[5:53] you're not gonna be here both services
[5:54] you need to let me know I don't need an
[5:57] explanation because I kind of figure out
[5:59] what it is anyway so just to be real
[6:03] frank with you but whatever situation
[6:06] you got if the way we're running it now
[6:08] please let me know if you're not going
[6:11] to be and I'll get somebody else and
[6:13] that's what some other churches are
[6:14] doing half of the people who come in
[6:16] Sunday more than half of the people kind
[6:17] of come in Sunday afternoon but our
[6:19] services are so close together till the
[6:23] people that I usually try to ask are the
[6:25] ones that usually are here both services
[6:27] so on in these trying times we have to
[6:31] be just a little bit different then we
[6:33] then we were before but we try to get
[6:35] the people here as we can if you'll
[6:37] notice what happened in that church
[6:39] that's that's not brother Fred Mullins
[6:41] Church is his brother's Church okay he's
[6:44] got a brother Mullins it's his church
[6:47] brother Joe had that on the text message
[6:50] but then he called me later because it's
[6:52] not brother Fred Mullins Church it's
[6:54] another church his brother's Church
[6:55] Charles I think Mullins is his name but
[6:59] you see that it started and got into the
[7:02] women to the sisters that's why I wanted
[7:04] to make sure we don't have no sisters
[7:06] here just the Lord may have done that
[7:09] but I just don't think that I think the
[7:11] men need to be here know reflect against
[7:15] and that we okay to a brother they'll
[7:16] know reflect against the women at all
[7:19] it's just that you're out there with
[7:21] your kids your kids are with other kids
[7:22] this one's with this when you got to go
[7:24] to the grocery store and you're out
[7:26] there more
[7:27] then we are and you're more susceptible
[7:30] to get it but we need to pray for that
[7:32] church because if it keeps back if it
[7:35] keeps happening back in churches again
[7:36] they're gonna they're gonna cut down on
[7:38] on us getting together in big groups so
[7:42] we just pray that the Lord will stay
[7:44] this thing again I still pray every day
[7:47] Lord stay this thing get rid of it so we
[7:51] can get back in me even if this is the
[7:52] end time I'd like for us to all get back
[7:54] you know I'd like for us all getting
[7:56] back together for a little while anyway
[7:57] and and we need we need each other we
[8:01] need to be together
[8:03] calling texting Facebook whatever you
[8:05] want to do doesn't matter FaceTime but
[8:07] just keep in touch with everybody if you
[8:09] need anything if you need anything you
[8:11] need to let us know I speak for brother
[8:14] Dale myself if you are in a need in this
[8:16] church and you're online or you're
[8:18] sitting here you need to let the church
[8:20] know because we we're a family we're a
[8:24] church family and we're in a position
[8:26] where we can help you a little bit if we
[8:28] have to so we would we would not brother
[8:31] Dale is the most giving person I've ever
[8:33] known so what's the difference now you
[8:36] know so when there's a real need there
[8:38] we'd like to be able to to help you fill
[8:41] it so you've got your Bibles turn the
[8:43] book Galatian
[8:44] we're in journey a believer of a
[8:46] believer part eight and as I said before
[8:49] I hope during this whole thing that
[8:53] you've took Abram out and put yourself
[8:55] in there because we've become real
[8:56] personal with this guy named Abram and
[8:58] Abraham but you're the one that's you
[9:01] know it's good to see that journey and
[9:02] it's good to read a story about his
[9:04] brother Tom publish always said the old
[9:06] war stories in the Old Testament well
[9:08] you know what those old war stories were
[9:10] actually happening but we're having war
[9:12] stories now where we're not paul says
[9:16] we're not fighting against flesh and
[9:18] blood but principalities and powers and
[9:20] and spirits and high places and that's
[9:24] what we're dealing with now so we're
[9:26] going to take the spiritual part because
[9:28] we can't all say well i walk just like
[9:30] abram did because that was four thousand
[9:33] years ago but as an as a type we can see
[9:37] that that did happen in his life and
[9:39] that happens in a
[9:40] way in your life okay I hope you're able
[9:42] to see that so Galatians 3 verse 16 and
[9:46] we'll run through the stages now I want
[9:50] to it's no surprise you know then in
[9:53] this church that that we we say preach
[9:58] we teach definitely three stages of
[10:02] grace justifications thank us Benson
[10:03] Holy Ghost but remember to complete the
[10:06] pull full plan of redemption there's six
[10:08] seals to complete that but we're not
[10:10] going to get into that we've already
[10:12] been into that but there is four stages
[10:14] because Joel tells us in the end time
[10:18] that I will restore the years that those
[10:22] four bugs eat down okay it's good to
[10:25] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[10:27] if you don't go on you don't complete
[10:29] your four stages which brother branham
[10:32] tells us that for death messengers are
[10:35] death bugs eat it down and there have to
[10:39] be there has to be for life messengers
[10:41] to bring it back are for life stages I
[10:45] will restore in four stages so it has to
[10:48] be justification sanctification the
[10:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother
[10:52] Bram tells us in one place the word our
[10:55] adoption or as brother Dale talking
[10:58] about the Son of Man and that's going on
[10:59] into the sixth sixth seals Redemption
[11:02] but in the four stages of redemption we
[11:04] got to come to a place to where we're at
[11:06] to hear you him and brother Brown said
[11:10] hear you them so okay you come to that
[11:13] place of what we call now speaking
[11:15] condition so Abraham did come to that
[11:19] but he had to go through these three
[11:21] stages first everybody wants to jump
[11:23] from one all the way up to know you know
[11:26] you do that and like brother Branham
[11:28] said power without character is the
[11:30] tonic all right so these characters that
[11:33] we're talking about if you would have
[11:35] give Abram the power that God gave
[11:38] Abraham if you would have give Abram
[11:43] Isaac at the first part of the journey
[11:45] and then God tells him to go take him up
[11:48] on the mountain and kill him he wouldn't
[11:51] have done it I'm just telling you
[11:52] because you wouldn't neither you
[11:53] wouldn't know what to
[11:54] do what God tells you to do at the
[11:57] beginning of your journey but now as
[11:59] Abram went to Abraham Abraham melt met
[12:02] God in human flesh and then after that
[12:05] there was a long ten or fifteen or
[12:07] sixteen years that he grew with God then
[12:11] God told him go take your son up there
[12:13] on the mountain and kill him and that's
[12:15] what we're gonna talk about today so
[12:16] we're gonna run through this real quick
[12:17] Galatians 3 verse 16 the Heavenly Father
[12:20] would thank you for the day that you
[12:21] give us we pray that you just be with us
[12:23] take care of us be with the ones Lord
[12:25] that are there sick the ones that are
[12:28] dying from this virus Lord we pray again
[12:30] that you'll stay this thing father and
[12:32] as as you told as Moses told Aaron said
[12:36] run through the crowd with a sense or
[12:38] Lord with a censer Lord the baptism of
[12:40] the Holy Ghost is what we we send out to
[12:43] the people Lord to keep them covered
[12:45] especially the church there and in
[12:46] Marion and all the different all the
[12:49] churches Lord that anything has been
[12:51] given as sickness Lord we pray that you
[12:54] would just take care of that Lord we
[12:55] pray that you'd be with us here in the
[12:57] building be with the ones outside in the
[12:59] parking lot just take care of each one
[13:01] Lord your blessings have already been
[13:03] put out I just pray that we reach and
[13:05] get them today father be with us Lord
[13:08] take care of us
[13:09] Justin got us Lord in this service in
[13:10] Jesus name Amen
[13:12] so now to Abraham and his seed were the
[13:16] promises made now his seed he saith not
[13:19] and to seeds as of many I hope you see
[13:21] that it the promise was not made to
[13:24] Ishmael now there was a promise but not
[13:27] the promise wasn't made to Ishmael or
[13:30] the other seven children that Abraham
[13:32] had with cateura
[13:34] that's just natural seed but he says and
[13:38] to thy seed which puts it right back to
[13:41] spirituality puts it right back to
[13:43] Christ so it was the spirit that was
[13:46] working in Abraham the spirit that was
[13:48] working in Moses but now remember that
[13:50] was had to be just a type because Christ
[13:56] couldn't go inside of him he could annoy
[13:59] Abram he could anoint Abraham brother
[14:02] brems tails I think I got it here where
[14:04] it said the same faith that Abram had
[14:08] Abraham had to have so he didn't lose
[14:10] his faith through the whole journey and
[14:11] that's why the journey of a believer
[14:14] believed you you don't stop believing
[14:17] you keep having faith all the way
[14:20] through for even for justification how
[14:22] in the world can you know that your past
[14:24] sins were chopped off because you still
[14:26] remember him
[14:27] your neighbor might still remember him
[14:28] if he saw you and the person you did it
[14:30] with definitely knows cuz they were
[14:32] there but God don't so I must have faith
[14:35] in that's part of my journey of
[14:37] justification that I have faith that
[14:39] he's the justifier and when he justifies
[14:43] you that's it and this I say that the
[14:45] Covenant that was confirmed before of
[14:47] God in Christ the law which was four
[14:50] hundred and thirty years after cannot
[14:51] dissin 'el so in other words what the
[14:53] law did was just kind of bring you under
[14:55] condemnation but it didn't bring the
[14:58] promise right all right that it
[15:01] shouldn't make the promise of none
[15:02] effect for if the inheritance be of the
[15:04] law it is no more promise what is the
[15:09] promise a law is written but a promise
[15:12] is grace a promise is the unwritten part
[15:16] have we come to now the seals brother
[15:19] Brown talks about the unwritten part of
[15:20] the Word of God if you want to continue
[15:22] on up the the revelation ladder I always
[15:25] say you're going up that revelation
[15:27] ladder the inheritance bill the law it
[15:29] is no more promise but God gave it to
[15:32] Abraham by promise you may be seeing the
[15:34] Lord as blessing the reading the word in
[15:37] Hebrews 6 verse 13 when God made promise
[15:39] to Abraham because he could swear by no
[15:41] greater swear by himself saying surely
[15:44] blessing I will bless them multiplying I
[15:46] will multiply they know us and so after
[15:48] he had patiently endured like I said
[15:50] before he did not give he gave the
[15:52] promise to Abram but now he didn't have
[15:57] the promise son at the beginning he had
[15:58] 25 years he had to wait and so after he
[16:02] had patiently endured we patiently
[16:05] endured since the Prophet in 1963 opened
[16:09] the seals and gave us the Revel at full
[16:12] revelation of the whole Bible everything
[16:15] was revealed under the seals we've been
[16:18] now almost sixty years since that time
[16:22] so God has been patient and you and I
[16:24] have been patient so after he had
[16:26] patiently endured he obtained the
[16:28] promise because what is our promise sure
[16:31] our promise is the baptism of the Holy
[16:34] Ghost
[16:34] but that's beginning of the promise the
[16:40] full promise is a body change in this
[16:42] end time that's why I said to four
[16:44] messengers everybody else has had three
[16:47] to deal with Luther Wesley we talked
[16:50] about it downstairs and you can bring it
[16:52] back and I want to get back like brother
[16:54] Dale in the Old Testament and start
[16:55] looking because I was watching what he
[16:57] was talking about this morning it when
[16:59] he read that scripture when was the
[17:01] sheaf waved it wasn't waved on the
[17:04] Sabbath it was waved on the day after
[17:09] the Sabbath family now the Sabbath's not
[17:12] Sunday establish the Saturday so when
[17:16] was it right when was it waved Sunday
[17:18] morning when Jesus Christ resurrected
[17:21] the firstfruits came up the sheath on
[17:24] the very day the eighth day oh my god
[17:30] I'm gonna get back in that to myself and
[17:32] we may mean that may intertwine but I've
[17:35] been really trying to want to get back
[17:37] into the every feast day so if you cover
[17:40] that that's okay but man this morning I
[17:42] thought oh boy that's wonderful and I'd
[17:45] really never seen them cuz they said cuz
[17:47] I thought he just preached just one out
[17:48] waved it but it's the day after the
[17:50] Sabbath you wait on the eighth day is
[17:52] when Jesus Christ was waved the eight
[17:54] days when he's waved in you when you
[17:57] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[17:58] because you're not you don't have the
[18:00] Holy Ghost if you're in still in the
[18:01] seventh day you got to go into the
[18:04] eighth day or a resurrection all right
[18:08] so there's this Melchizedek brother Ram
[18:11] says when Abraham met him he was
[18:12] Melchizedek he unfolds here all the
[18:15] attributes we'll do in the final end
[18:16] every son of Abraham so if we believe
[18:18] what brother Brown said then we know
[18:20] that this has got to happen to all of us
[18:22] every son of Abraham every son of the
[18:25] faith what are we we're the faith seed
[18:29] we're not I don't think that we even
[18:31] could check back far enough and be the
[18:33] physical
[18:34] seed of Abraham and it wouldn't do you
[18:38] any good if you were but to see to see
[18:42] that you're the spiritual seed of
[18:43] Abraham the only genealogy book you need
[18:46] to go back to is this one this is where
[18:49] your spiritual genealogy is your natural
[18:51] genealogy this tells how your mom and
[18:53] your grandma your grandpa and all the
[18:55] different ones but this tells you who
[18:56] your father is we don't go back no
[18:59] further god don't have grandkids so we
[19:04] don't go we go by father and the Bible
[19:08] says that that the New Jerusalem which
[19:10] come out of heaven is our mother so we
[19:13] got a mother and a father and here you
[19:15] and I are sons and daughters of God mmm
[19:18] so look at this plan of redemption then
[19:21] in four stages because we're going we're
[19:23] going through justification
[19:24] sanctification we've been through the
[19:25] baptism of the holy ghost and now we're
[19:27] got we got to go where Abraham meets
[19:29] Melchizedek and then after so many years
[19:32] we're going to go to Genesis 22 where
[19:34] God tells him says take him out and kill
[19:37] him and then so now we saw in
[19:44] justification if you ever want to go
[19:47] back if somebody's just watching in
[19:48] Chapter 12 and chapter 13 of the book of
[19:52] Genesis in chapter 14 most of it is the
[19:58] justification because you're gonna see
[20:00] we'll read that in just a second but
[20:02] you're gonna see where the Lord speaks
[20:05] to Abram and says get up and leave
[20:06] you're gonna see also that when we get
[20:09] and we're gonna type Ruth what is Ruth's
[20:12] first stage what's the first thing Ruth
[20:15] does I got I wrote down hit she decides
[20:17] Abram had to decide whether that was God
[20:22] or not in Genesis 12 that spoke to him
[20:25] and by faith he believed it was because
[20:28] this guy is talking to Abram and he says
[20:31] I will I will make thee a great nation I
[20:34] will bless thee I would so not deductive
[20:41] reasoning Aaron but if you somebody
[20:44] comes and tells you that I will
[20:47] all these things and is humanly
[20:49] impossible for a human being to do it
[20:52] then it must be God
[20:54] so there's your your reasoning that
[20:57] Abram had because remember Abram didn't
[20:59] have the baptism of the Holy oh he heard
[21:02] a voice and the voice says get up and
[21:04] leave so Abram decided the same way with
[21:06] you and me and everybody else one day we
[21:09] decided to listen to what that voice
[21:12] told us whether that voice was from a
[21:15] preacher or from a deacon or an elder or
[21:17] anybody else that had the baptism of the
[21:20] Holy Ghost because you have to hear it
[21:23] this is what I like you brother Branham
[21:25] says seed life comes through the body
[21:27] you have to hear somebody that's been
[21:28] quickened before you are quicken a man
[21:32] you have to hear from somebody that the
[21:34] words already been clicking - other than
[21:38] that it's just conversation it's just a
[21:41] conversation piece and and then you know
[21:43] lluís will go back to his old buddies
[21:45] and he'll start talking about the Lord
[21:47] well they can receive from that but if
[21:49] the buddy start talking to the other
[21:51] buddy and all the buddies talk together
[21:53] they don't have the Holy what they going
[21:54] to talk about they gonna talk about the
[21:57] old things they used to do but when
[21:59] somebody with the seed life like Luis
[22:02] walks up to the crowd and they start
[22:04] calling my songs on Shawn so and Luis
[22:06] says we I don't do that anymore that's
[22:09] not part of me anymore let me tell you
[22:12] how I got changed
[22:16] see that's the seed life as brother Dale
[22:19] was talking about the seed we know the
[22:21] sword the Steve's the son of man but how
[22:24] is he sewing it
[22:24] you didn't hear Jesus physically speak
[22:27] we don't have no tape we've got what's
[22:31] written in this book but who's to say
[22:33] that that books wrong who's to say that
[22:34] books not I said who's to say because it
[22:37] can be questioned but once you get the
[22:39] life of that person that wrote that book
[22:41] inside of you then you say Amen like
[22:44] brother Graham said you say amen to
[22:45] every word you have - why because the
[22:51] one that wrote it is the one that's
[22:53] inside here looking at that and
[22:56] responding back
[22:58] to what's already been wrote because
[23:01] that's where you find yourself in the
[23:02] word because you can read this Bible and
[23:07] get you a little star Sunday school
[23:09] starts with just fine for the kids and
[23:11] read your scriptures but unless it
[23:13] becomes alive - yeah it's just a another
[23:15] book to read all right like what I'm
[23:18] saying about Abram Abram had to decide
[23:21] that this was God talking to him this
[23:24] was somebody talking to him that could
[23:26] fulfill all this because you know his
[23:28] fans probably said hi Abram yeah you got
[23:32] a good job
[23:33] you and your daddy's working together
[23:35] and you know your business is pretty
[23:36] brisk they're buying idols you know
[23:38] everything is good and fine and you're
[23:41] making some good money and cuts his
[23:44] Abram I'm gonna make you great now it's
[23:49] daddy never told him that I would say
[23:52] his daddy his physical daddy never said
[23:54] Abram I'm gonna make it great I want to
[23:57] give you land I want to give you a
[24:01] nation I will bless you and make your
[24:05] name great and I will bless them that
[24:09] bless thee and curse them he had to know
[24:12] it one time just like you and I had to
[24:14] know it one time it wasn't just a voice
[24:17] that spoke to you that had been speaking
[24:21] to you before Noah is a special type of
[24:23] voice that when you connect it to it
[24:26] something happened when you listen to
[24:28] that voice that called you out of the
[24:31] world that was a special voice now
[24:34] there's been many voices in my life and
[24:36] same way of you as sometimes that
[24:38] sometimes I know when the Devils talking
[24:40] to me now and he tells a lot truth
[24:45] sometimes but you have to watch his
[24:47] motive but when God speaks to you a lot
[24:50] of times he just speaks and then that's
[24:53] it he's gone and then that's what he did
[24:57] was late but with Abram see through your
[24:59] journey starting with justification and
[25:00] bring that back up again join this plan
[25:04] of redemption Genesis 12 through 15 - 15
[25:07] but in Ezekiel to me Ezekiel is where it
[25:11] nails it all down
[25:12] and tells you exactly so let's go to it
[25:14] therefore saves us that the Lord I will
[25:15] even gather you from the people know
[25:17] what hey this is this is your journey of
[25:19] a Christian right here in Ezekiel
[25:21] because he had to call you out here to
[25:23] call Abram out
[25:25] I will even gather you from the people
[25:27] and assemble you out of the countries
[25:31] where you have been scattered in other
[25:33] words that bar you used to go to in that
[25:35] country club at least that Country Club
[25:40] used to go to Rite Country Club he's
[25:43] calling you out of those things where
[25:46] you've been scattered and I will give
[25:47] you the Land of Israel now what is the
[25:50] Land of Israel the promised land
[25:51] alright so now here we see this and and
[25:56] forgive me if I go over this over and
[25:57] over again but things open up to me more
[25:59] and more every time I start reading the
[26:01] same identical scripture like that one
[26:03] talking about countries where you've
[26:04] been scattered it is the different
[26:07] places you've been not not countries as
[26:09] far as United States Europe and all
[26:10] these different though it's a country
[26:13] you've been walking in that you should
[26:15] not because he's bringing you out of
[26:18] that country and putting you in the Land
[26:20] of Israel there's no promise out here
[26:22] this is where the promise is and that
[26:24] just as Israel cannot and will not be
[26:27] blessed unless they're in the white
[26:29] Promised Land you as a Christian will
[26:32] not and cannot be blessed when you get
[26:35] out of the promised land which is the
[26:37] baptism the Holy Ghost you thought no
[26:38] you can't lose it but you can sure
[26:40] grieve it you can sure step over into
[26:43] another country but he's gonna what he's
[26:47] gonna call you back if you're a true son
[26:48] you won't lose that you won't keep going
[26:50] in that direction no he'll call you back
[26:53] and they shall come thither and they
[26:56] shall take away all the detestable
[26:58] things thereof now what is so much your
[27:00] life I had some detestable things did
[27:04] you not yeah so he's talking to me
[27:07] that's that Scripture is there just for
[27:09] me you got this I wear this for you or
[27:12] not take away all the detestable things
[27:16] thereof and all the abominations that
[27:18] covers all of us because unless you're
[27:21] born again you're an abomination to God
[27:23] sorry that's just the way it is there's
[27:25] no gray
[27:26] you're either in or out now you can be
[27:28] on your journey but God knows how far
[27:30] you gonna go in and journey and I will
[27:32] give them one heart and I will put a new
[27:34] spirit within you know we talked about
[27:36] this but I want to keep going back to it
[27:38] I will take the Stoney heart out of
[27:40] their flesh and I will give them a heart
[27:42] of flesh in other words he's starting
[27:43] you on your journey you're getting
[27:44] something new you're getting a new heart
[27:48] you're justified your sins have been
[27:51] chopped off God has done a work in your
[27:54] life that he has not done in billions of
[27:57] other people's life but he's doing it
[28:00] for you because you responded and you
[28:03] decided that that was God talking to you
[28:06] and you decided you as I've always said
[28:10] you get sick and tired of being sick and
[28:12] tired right when you get sick and tired
[28:14] of being sick and tired then God can
[28:16] work on you all right so let's hold on
[28:20] to that because he's going to take the
[28:21] Stoney heart out and give you a heart
[28:24] that he can work with that's in
[28:26] justification sanctification Genesis 15
[28:30] we know Genesis 15 starts I said after
[28:34] these things the word of the Lord came
[28:35] unto Abram in a vision now remember he's
[28:37] still Abram he's still Abram he's still
[28:40] doing the some things you know that
[28:43] maybe he shouldn't be doing and like I
[28:45] said before he took a lot with him and
[28:47] you take a lot with you when you take
[28:48] off on your journey all right let's go
[28:50] to sanctification Genesis 15 don't go to
[28:53] get but go right there that's fine but
[28:55] in Genesis 15 16 is sanctification if
[29:00] you want to keep reading that that where
[29:02] God put Abram to sleep told him he was
[29:05] zeroed out he had no because you can't
[29:07] sanctify yourself you can't justify
[29:12] yourself for sure but you can't sanctify
[29:15] yourself you of your own self
[29:17] remember the unclean spirit goes out but
[29:19] remember there's still a place that he
[29:21] can come back to be careful with that
[29:24] because he'll give you what he'll give
[29:28] you a religious spirit and think
[29:31] everything's okay but now Abram didn't
[29:33] stop when all this was done all these
[29:36] sacrifices all these different things
[29:39] God showed him hell death brother Brown
[29:42] tells all these things that he showed
[29:44] him but when Abram walk woke back up
[29:49] he just kept running walking
[29:51] he didn't say all right I'm done I can't
[29:54] do this in the morning he turns running
[29:55] goes no he just kept on going
[29:57] get something that makes a mistake
[29:59] because he takes Hagar and has a child
[30:02] but it's not the promised child it's not
[30:07] the promise he gets the promise but he's
[30:10] not the promised child that's not
[30:11] perfect well that's permissible because
[30:13] the Bible says that the bondwoman will
[30:16] not have anything to do with the free
[30:18] woman now the bond woman was who that
[30:20] was Hagar all right we don't want to be
[30:23] bound we want to be with the free woman
[30:26] which was Sarah all right so you see
[30:29] where the true purpose of the plan and
[30:35] promise was with Sarah the whole time
[30:38] not with Hagar but but God allowed that
[30:43] to come in to give us another group of
[30:46] people that can come into the kingdom
[30:48] that gets another promise that can live
[30:51] outside the city that can be not born
[30:54] again listen they won't be born again
[30:58] foolish version never gets born again if
[31:01] you get born again you're a born again
[31:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit filled
[31:08] child of God and you live in the city
[31:10] seed of Abraham but now the seed of
[31:15] Hagar and or not Hagar but the seed of
[31:17] Ishmael they can live outside the city
[31:20] they can be imparted or given a promise
[31:23] are given eternal life which is the
[31:26] foolish virgin cup of water my name
[31:28] people that don't make it to the age of
[31:30] accountability we forget those people
[31:32] sometimes and I also want to remember
[31:34] one other group I was thinking about
[31:35] this the other day and what what a great
[31:38] guard that gave us a prophet I got a
[31:40] friend of mine Timmy McCoy that's got a
[31:42] Down syndrome girl and she's about 30
[31:44] held she attends about 30 something
[31:46] about 30 33 that's okay lar Beth
[31:52] you know brother Brown said those kind
[31:54] of children had a special angel that was
[31:57] with them from birth you know why
[32:00] because they're gonna be given eternal
[32:01] life
[32:02] they can't be judged for they what they
[32:04] are in the condition they're in so what
[32:06] a mighty God that sent us a prophet to
[32:10] clarify all that people that like that
[32:12] that are down syndrome they're gonna be
[32:15] there but you know what their soul is
[32:17] not down syndrome
[32:18] that's why brother Ram said he said
[32:21] that's the splitting of a cell from what
[32:24] happens out here in the world no no no
[32:26] disrespect to Tim Ian and Kathy at all
[32:29] it's just something to happen in the
[32:31] birth natural happening in the body but
[32:37] God made provision that when that when
[32:40] that baby came forth
[32:41] he gave lore about the soul but that
[32:44] soul is gonna be eternal not then now
[32:46] she'll have to go to white throne
[32:48] judgment but still that you see all
[32:50] these provisions you say well what are
[32:52] you saying she's she's under a promise
[32:55] she's under a promise now not the
[32:57] promise of Abraham she'll never be a
[32:59] seed of Abraham but she can be a seat of
[33:02] Ishmael she can be a seed that your
[33:04] seems eternal life or receives a promise
[33:07] thank God I when I see downs children I
[33:09] I hate it for them but you know what
[33:14] this is what I also think there's mama
[33:17] and daddy don't go to church don't care
[33:24] nothin about God but that person that
[33:27] they brought up that way that condition
[33:30] the turn they're gonna be given eternal
[33:32] life the parents are not they may not be
[33:35] but there's a person that's that's I
[33:38] always think of duty people
[33:42] brain-damaged stuff like that God makes
[33:44] provisions for that he's he's a graceful
[33:46] God and so he puts a we're not supposed
[33:50] to be part of the bondwoman but yet the
[33:52] bondwoman wasn't cast that sure she was
[33:54] cast out of the home naturally but God
[33:57] still remember she was sitting by well
[33:59] she was getting ready to die thirsty get
[34:02] ready to feed the Ishmael and God
[34:05] come says he sends an angel says I'm
[34:08] gonna take care of you now why need just
[34:10] leave it alone if it was so trashy and
[34:12] so bad no there has to be another line
[34:15] there of be given eternal life or
[34:18] permissive will that's going to populate
[34:21] this whole world probably a hundred
[34:23] times more than the bride but that's
[34:25] okay
[34:26] that's all right but you and I have been
[34:29] called to be the seed of Abraham
[34:32] that's our call that's our promises to
[34:35] be these seed children of Abraham for I
[34:39] will take from among you the healer now
[34:40] this is a Ezekiel 36 now when we read
[34:44] before was Ezekiel 11 so this is going
[34:47] up a little higher as Ezekiel 36 says
[34:49] for I will take you from among the
[34:51] heathen and gather you out of all
[34:54] countries and will bring you into your
[34:55] own land so he's got to bring you out
[34:58] then I will sprinkle clean water upon
[35:00] you washing to the water of the word
[35:02] remember this is sanctification what is
[35:04] sanctification cleaned and set aside for
[35:07] service with water everybody got that
[35:09] same AM and ye shall be clean didn't say
[35:14] that back in the other way just gave you
[35:15] a new heart right now we're talking
[35:19] about cleaning up in sanctification from
[35:22] all your filthiness and all your idols
[35:26] will I cleanse you now remember this
[35:27] scripture because when brother Branham
[35:29] speaks and tells us he tells us that he
[35:33] gives us a new spirit but it's not the
[35:35] Holy Spirit so this is not going about
[35:38] the Holy Spirit a new heart well I give
[35:42] you justification and a new spirit will
[35:46] I put within you that's not the Holy
[35:49] Spirit Colette seat he doesn't say
[35:51] that's my spirit he said I'll give you a
[35:54] new spirit within you and I will take
[35:57] away the stony heart out of your flesh
[35:59] and I will give you a heart of flesh so
[36:02] he's going to do this to help us in our
[36:05] sanctification look at number two hidden
[36:06] life in Christ I'd like to stop here
[36:08] possible and tell you some things on
[36:10] that your little created yourself he
[36:13] said he'd give you a new spirit now that
[36:14] spirit isn't God spirit that's your
[36:17] spirit
[36:18] God gives you a new spirit then he says
[36:20] I'll put my spirit in him now that's
[36:23] third stage of the baptism of the Holy
[36:24] Ghost
[36:25] but the thing God has to do is give you
[36:27] a new spirit make your nature a little
[36:29] more gentle and settle down or you
[36:31] couldn't even live with you he's not
[36:34] gonna live you with you when that
[36:35] unclean spirits inside Luke verse Luke
[36:38] there in Luke whatever it is 11 it talks
[36:40] about the unclean spirit going out well
[36:42] you know what's gonna happen gonna work
[36:44] on you while that thing's gone because
[36:47] he can finally touch you a little bit
[36:49] remember he picked the jar up but he
[36:51] sets it down and still nasty but he's
[36:53] starting to clean it up he's getting
[36:55] ready to put it in service he had put it
[36:56] in service yet but you know what that is
[36:59] the glass see that's where we can go
[37:02] back to predestination when he picked it
[37:05] up it was a glass when it was made it
[37:08] was a glass but he got put in the mud
[37:11] that's not the purpose for that glass
[37:13] the purpose for that glass is to be
[37:16] clean so you can drink out of it
[37:17] everybody got that amen to a
[37:20] predestination God knew by foreknowledge
[37:22] that you know they some cups is gonna
[37:25] stay in there because he knows they
[37:28] won't stay clean become the bus but he
[37:32] knew when he picked you up those who is
[37:35] justified
[37:36] he is already drink from the cup God can
[37:41] do that we can't because we look at it
[37:43] and go I still that's kind of nasty to
[37:45] me but you know what God's got a plan
[37:47] and a purpose God knows that that
[37:50] thing's got to start from the inside out
[37:53] starting with sanctification but the
[37:56] thing God has to do is give you a new
[37:58] spirit make your nature a little more
[38:00] gentle and settle down or he couldn't
[38:01] even live with you see he's got to get
[38:04] you fixed up first before he can come in
[38:06] I'll give you a new spirit then you take
[38:08] him anywhere you go all kinds of places
[38:12] mainly Church and get around other
[38:17] born-again people cuz you really don't
[38:20] know how to act because remember the
[38:21] unclean spirit goes out but you still
[38:22] got that old nature and still hanging on
[38:26] until the until the what until the
[38:28] cutting of the foreskin you still got
[38:30] that old nature
[38:32] but when God comes and fills you up in
[38:35] seals you then you got the nature of God
[38:37] and you just keep moving on as Abraham
[38:40] because remember during this part of the
[38:42] journey it's still Abram Abram it's not
[38:46] turned to Abraham until Genesis chapter
[38:49] 17 when he's given this he's got faith
[38:52] and he's given the seal of circumcision
[38:54] - what all right you're Abraham you're
[38:58] not going back to Abram no more you're
[39:01] Abraham now you can complete the promise
[39:04] I gave you when you were Abram he's got
[39:09] to get you fixed up so he can so what so
[39:11] you can entertain him right now most of
[39:14] us did not entertain God right before we
[39:16] been Christians we entertained that
[39:19] other guy oh yeah number three in
[39:22] travail notice you put a new spirit God
[39:25] has to give you a new spirit you
[39:27] couldn't even get along with him you
[39:29] can't get along with yourself that old
[39:30] devil spirits you have in you everybody
[39:33] says amen and he's got to put a new
[39:37] spirit in you so you can get along with
[39:39] his spirit amen
[39:40] I will put a new spirit in them and I
[39:42] will put my spirit in them that's later
[39:44] on and after he gives you a new spirit
[39:47] that's you don't get it confused with
[39:50] God's Spirit it's not it's your new
[39:54] spirit so you can get along with the
[39:55] Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you
[39:58] all right any will so let's look at the
[40:01] new birth real quick excuse me Genesis
[40:05] 17 starts the new birth we went through
[40:06] that we see that in Genesis 17 Abram was
[40:13] ninety years old and nine and the Lord
[40:15] appeared to Abram and said I am the
[40:17] Almighty God don't go you're fine then
[40:19] he goes right back to what he said
[40:21] before I will make the exceeding
[40:23] fruitful I will establish my covenant
[40:25] verse eight I will give unto thee I will
[40:29] be their God this is my covenant that ye
[40:32] shall keep between me and you and thy
[40:34] seed afterwards every man child among
[40:37] you shall be circumcised and we're
[40:39] talking about circumcision
[40:40] now remember circumcision watch this
[40:44] real quick let's read this right here
[40:45] let's read what brother Brown says about
[40:47] circumcision real quick
[40:49] Ezekiel 36 let's read this here now here
[40:51] we go to the same thing we were
[40:53] originally read in Ezekiel 36 verse 25
[40:57] to 26 now let's add to 28 Rob will take
[41:01] from you among the heathen and gather
[41:02] your out of all your countries and will
[41:03] bring you into your own land then will I
[41:05] sprinkle clean water upon you and you
[41:07] shall be clean for all your filthiness
[41:08] from all your idols will I cleanse you
[41:10] and a new heart also will I give you in
[41:12] a new spirit well I put within you and I
[41:14] will take away the stony heart out of
[41:16] your flesh and I will give you a heart
[41:17] of flesh now that's what we stop but
[41:19] when we go on to verse 27 now here's
[41:22] where brother man I'm talking about and
[41:23] I will put my spirit within you and
[41:25] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[41:28] shall keep my judgments and do them and
[41:32] you shall dwell in the land that I give
[41:34] to your fathers and you shall be my
[41:35] people and I will be their God brother
[41:37] Branham says in hidden life with Christ
[41:39] number 4 then the Bible said he would
[41:41] give us a new heart and he will give us
[41:43] a new spirit many people even
[41:45] Pentecostal people in full gospel people
[41:47] has been deceived in that and many
[41:49] people in the message because we see the
[41:52] people falling away brother Claude now
[41:55] we're talking yesterday and you know
[41:56] brother Brown said that Satan can
[41:59] impersonate all nine spiritual gifts
[42:02] well you know what we always go to
[42:03] tongues and interpretation but there is
[42:05] wisdom in there now we have the spirit
[42:09] of wisdom on this side but if Satan can
[42:13] impersonate he can have somebody like
[42:15] the brother in North Carolina preached
[42:16] thirty years the message of the hour
[42:18] with a good knowledge of the message and
[42:20] then leave you see what wisdom he got
[42:24] though he got the wisdom up from the
[42:26] other guy I'm sorry that's just the way
[42:29] it is I mean it I'm not saying anything
[42:31] bad against the brother but when you
[42:33] turn and say brother Brown was lying now
[42:35] see he lied to the people what are you
[42:38] saying
[42:38] then everything is a lot all 1,100
[42:42] sermons everything take it we'll just
[42:44] wipe his history out if it's one you
[42:46] know if he's life he's lying
[42:49] but you can have wisdom without having
[42:53] God's wisdom what's the point we were
[42:54] talking about you can have the nine
[42:56] spiritual gifts a lot of times and and
[42:59] they'd not be the route from coming from
[43:01] the right guy because if he can
[43:02] impersonate him then that's what's
[43:04] happening now well this is not an
[43:05] impersonation when he puts his spirit
[43:08] God puts his spirit inside of you he's
[43:11] took out the old spirit and done away
[43:14] with that other guy and give you his
[43:18] spirit many times God said I'll give you
[43:20] a new spirit that wasn't his spirit
[43:22] that's your spirit then I will put my
[43:25] spirit in you I will give you a new
[43:27] spirit then I will put my spirit in you
[43:29] and many times you get the new spirit
[43:31] and think you've got the holy spirit and
[43:34] trusting upon emotions and signs and let
[43:38] me put nine spiritual girl told if he
[43:42] can impersonate them you got to be
[43:44] careful when your life doesn't pivi up
[43:47] to that now that's just a little role
[43:51] but remember it's the truth many people
[43:53] that spirit that new spirit God had to
[43:55] give you a new spirit to get along with
[43:57] his spirit well some people so mean they
[43:59] can't even get along with themselves let
[44:01] alone with God if you'd come in that's
[44:02] right so doubtful up and down God has to
[44:05] give you a new spirit giving you nature
[44:06] so you can get along with his spirit
[44:08] when it comes I hope you see it God
[44:11] gives you a new spirit for yourself and
[44:13] then puts his Holy Spirit in there amen
[44:16] to dwell with you and abide with you
[44:19] everybody got that we've been over this
[44:22] over and over but I want to read number
[44:23] five impersonation of Christianity just
[44:25] go to the red part his spirit was
[44:28] different from your new spirit and many
[44:30] people get the new spirit and think they
[44:32] got the holy spirit they got feeling how
[44:34] me happy jump around maybe do a few
[44:37] things religiously and they think that
[44:40] they got the Holy Spirit oh no the Holy
[44:42] Spirit makes you act different the Holy
[44:44] Spirit makes you think different the
[44:46] Holy Spirit was put right in the middle
[44:48] of your new spirit and your new spirit
[44:50] was putting right in the middle of your
[44:51] new heart the new heart the new spirit
[44:54] in the middle of the new heart and God
[44:55] said I'll put my spirit in you you just
[45:00] got the love of God so down in you till
[45:03] you just live it it isn't you it's
[45:05] something in you now that's not now also
[45:09] let's read these next few because the
[45:11] circumcision
[45:13] brother Brown says there's one in the
[45:15] church beautiful God took crossed at
[45:17] Calvary
[45:18] tore him apart soul and body he sent the
[45:21] body upon his right hand and sent the
[45:22] Holy Spirit by the covenant with the
[45:24] people and you and you believe by faith
[45:27] like Abraham did and he was given the
[45:31] seal of circumcision for a confirmation
[45:34] of his faith and you believe and accept
[45:39] Jesus as your Savior then God gives you
[45:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[45:42] confirmation of your faith that's why
[45:46] you and I are the faith seed of Abraham
[45:48] you say you believe it hadn't received
[45:51] the Holy Ghost something's wrong with
[45:53] your faith God circumcised is the heart
[45:56] the minute the believer really comes in
[45:58] full surrender say that say that folks
[46:03] surely must have done something I felt
[46:06] that even back then that in other words
[46:07] he felt somebody kick him back from him
[46:10] out in the audience I believe when the
[46:12] believer firmly believes on the Lord
[46:14] Jesus Christ but like I said before he's
[46:16] probably preaching the Pentecostals and
[46:17] people say well you got to speak in
[46:19] tongues you got to interpret you got to
[46:20] do this cuz that's what their evidence
[46:22] is if you don't speak in tongues you
[46:24] ain't got Holy Ghost
[46:24] in the Pentecostal realm especially back
[46:28] when in 19 and 53 when he's preaching
[46:31] this oh yeah then Pentecostals believe
[46:34] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[46:36] the Holy Ghost but he's not telling he's
[46:38] telling said look when the believer
[46:39] firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:41] God's under obligation to give him the
[46:43] Holy Ghost
[46:44] confirmation of his faith say what's the
[46:48] matter brother Branham just your faith
[46:49] that's all if you'd surely believed
[46:51] God's there to give it to you number
[46:55] seven commit God's commissioning Moses
[46:57] oh I thought I got the Holy Ghost when I
[47:00] believe they still teach that but it's
[47:02] wrong faith all right faith is good now
[47:06] remember there's a quote up further in
[47:09] the message where brother Branham says
[47:10] faith alone won't do it Wow we'll get
[47:14] into that later on thanks God abraham
[47:17] believed God and it was imputed or
[47:19] reckon unto him for righteousness
[47:20] but God give him the seal of
[47:22] circumcision as a seal of his faith
[47:26] when you get pure genuine faith in God
[47:28] God will give you the baptism of the
[47:30] Holy Ghost as the seal of the promise
[47:32] which is a seal that you have faith not
[47:37] that you'll get it but you have faith
[47:41] you might make some kind of an
[47:43] impression or make people believe or you
[47:47] might say you got faith but when you
[47:49] really got genuine unadulterated faith
[47:54] God will give you the baptism of the
[47:57] Holy Ghost as a seal of the promise amen
[47:59] that's not skim milk now children now
[48:02] let's read romans 4 verse 9 we know what
[48:05] happened in verse 17 about the new birth
[48:10] were he changes his name to Abraham
[48:13] changes your name to Christian because
[48:15] you're really not a you're really not a
[48:17] full-fledged Christian until you get the
[48:19] baptism of Holy Ghost you're believing
[48:21] unto all right and that's where like you
[48:24] know even you're like brother man we'll
[48:26] talk to the Baptist once saved always
[48:27] saved now if you're once saved always
[48:30] saved and it continues on all these
[48:32] years then yeah but when you but when
[48:35] will you watch people and I you don't
[48:37] want to say this but I'm going to you
[48:39] got to say this because you look at
[48:41] people that you look at their life and
[48:43] and maybe back at 12 years old they come
[48:46] up and made us shake hands turn around
[48:48] mmm you know signed a letter and and
[48:50] then they never darken the doors of a
[48:52] church and you see their life doesn't as
[48:55] brother Evan says pivi up to to what the
[48:57] Bible says but then when they pass away
[49:00] and the people do their funeral
[49:02] especially if it's a good Baptist they
[49:04] said well they got saved back at 12
[49:05] years old once saved always say well now
[49:08] I don't agree with that and God don't
[49:10] agree with that and brother Branham
[49:12] didn't agree with that all right now but
[49:14] once they've to always say brother Brown
[49:16] said I'll go with you
[49:17] if it's once saved always going to the
[49:22] end and you keep seeing the
[49:24] characteristics of God all the way
[49:25] through their life but that's a gross
[49:30] error to tell the people that because
[49:32] Paul looks at them and says have you
[49:33] received the Holy Ghost since you
[49:35] believe amen but you got it's all based
[49:39] on faith that's
[49:40] this journey of a believer believing you
[49:42] got to believe something everybody okay
[49:45] with that you got to leave something so
[49:48] let's just believe that God's gonna give
[49:50] us the baptism of the Holy Ghost or are
[49:52] you already give it to us but now when
[49:53] you do that you don't just sit down
[49:56] Abraham just didn't sit down and chair
[49:58] and say I'm done no man he still met God
[50:03] fed a calf to him made butter went
[50:06] through his life took his son up to a
[50:09] mountain it's just a lot we have to do
[50:12] brother Brown said wants time and I know
[50:14] it's quoted here many many times brother
[50:16] Ram tells us brother Dale's told us when
[50:19] you're when you get born again you just
[50:22] start your Christian journey that's just
[50:25] a very beginning of your journey of a
[50:28] believer because you're believing on two
[50:31] but when brother Branham says right here
[50:32] when God gives you the Holy Ghost
[50:34] because of a confirmation of your faith
[50:38] then there's the connection he believes
[50:42] all God is as a believer there's no one
[50:46] belief in him but there's unbelief in us
[50:50] but when that unbelief is driven out of
[50:52] that inside man and the believer that
[50:55] has no unbelief goes inside there and he
[50:58] seals it up the brother berm says you
[51:01] become a believer now there's a lot of
[51:03] doubt in your human mind and even in
[51:05] your spirit realm but that inside man
[51:07] cannot be contrary to the word because
[51:09] it is word can't be contrary now we know
[51:13] that didn't happen to Abraham because
[51:15] you can't get more to get in the Old
[51:17] Testament but it does happen to us that
[51:21] example is for us that Abraham continued
[51:24] on and like I said before he looks out
[51:26] and he says my lord he knew that was a
[51:28] man he met that Melchizedek that he had
[51:30] met back in his journey of justification
[51:34] all right let's read Romans 4 verse 9
[51:37] and see what Paul says about this cometh
[51:40] this blessedness of then upon the
[51:42] circumcision only because you got to
[51:44] remember in the Old Testament that was a
[51:48] sign that you were a believer now I
[51:52] I have nothing to go on but I'm gonna
[51:54] say that every person that was
[51:57] circumcised I don't know if they were a
[52:00] believer or not cuz I mean Judas was a
[52:03] Jew and he probably was circumcised and
[52:06] he turned out to be what he was you
[52:09] understand what I'm saying so back in
[52:11] the Old Testament had to be just a type
[52:13] right because remember all Jews that
[52:16] come out of Egypt under all that yeah
[52:23] why wouldn't you be a believer if God
[52:25] fed you every day he watered you every
[52:29] day you clothes never wore out and
[52:34] that's a hard thing because buddy that
[52:36] was babies being born thousands a day
[52:38] and here they are knees a little
[52:39] swaddling clothes and then you see him
[52:41] at eight years old eight years later the
[52:43] clothes grew with them but they were
[52:47] unbelievers two million of them died in
[52:51] the wilderness under unbelief but yet
[52:55] they were what they were circumcised
[52:57] Jews they believed where the seed of
[53:00] Abraham Caiaphas was standing there in
[53:03] the temple totally circumcised in his
[53:05] flesh he could be a high priest if he
[53:08] wasn't but what good did it do so this
[53:11] is what Paul was dealing with now cometh
[53:13] this blessedness then upon the
[53:15] circumcision only or upon the
[53:18] uncircumcision also for we say that
[53:21] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[53:23] righteousness how was it then reckoned
[53:27] when he was in circumcision I love this
[53:30] because this explains that Abraham
[53:32] didn't just become a believer when he
[53:35] met Melchizedek
[53:36] he didn't just become a believer when
[53:39] God made him and said your name is now
[53:41] Abraham Paul's fixing to tell you the
[53:45] Covenant was given when he was back in
[53:48] uncircumcision so the promise was given
[53:52] you when you started walking in
[53:54] justification if you truly go all the
[53:57] way then that's where God your faith
[53:59] started back there not the night you got
[54:02] the new birth remember the night you get
[54:04] the new bar
[54:05] or the day you get the Newburgh is the
[54:07] day that God confirms your faith not
[54:10] that you're getting faith but that you
[54:13] have faith and that faith has been
[54:16] cultivated and cultured from all the
[54:19] time whenever God first calls you till
[54:21] now because watch what he says right
[54:22] here he says now look how was it then
[54:26] reckoned when he was in circumcision or
[54:28] an uncircumcision we're all going now
[54:30] don't know when when Abraham circumcised
[54:33] itself that's when he started believing
[54:35] no he believed that day when God called
[54:38] him into erv Chaldees out of that room
[54:42] that he was in making idols because look
[54:47] what's right here how's it reckon was it
[54:53] in circumcision or uncircumcision not in
[54:56] circumcision but in uncircumcision and
[55:00] he received the sign of circumcision a
[55:04] seal of the righteousness of the faith
[55:06] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[55:13] that he might be the father of what us
[55:17] all of them that what believe that's why
[55:19] this journey of a believer though they
[55:23] be not circumcised that righteousness
[55:25] might be imputed unto them also romans 4
[55:31] verse 18 once what it says who against
[55:34] hope believed in hope that he might
[55:37] become the father of many nations
[55:38] according to that which was spoken so
[55:41] shall thy seed be and being not weak in
[55:43] faith he considered not his body now
[55:46] dead
[55:47] circumstances when he was about a
[55:49] hundred years old neither yet the
[55:50] deadness of Sarah's womb now remember he
[55:53] didn't just take him back to young men
[55:55] and women brother Brahm says I've got
[55:57] the quote in there I may use it next
[55:59] week but he says he actually had to heal
[56:01] Sarah in her womb
[56:04] because he could have turned her back to
[56:06] twenty years old and she wasn't fertile
[56:08] to begin with they've been having
[56:10] relations for so many years and never
[56:12] had a child but you know he was fertile
[56:15] because he had a child with Hagar and he
[56:18] had an inch male
[56:19] so what and listen it's not the male's
[56:23] problem in this in this journey that
[56:25] we're in it's the females problem the
[56:33] male Jesus Christ is fertile he sold
[56:35] seed and that's he's gonna come up our
[56:38] problem is is we haven't received that
[56:41] seed I'm not talking about us I'm dumb
[56:42] people that are not born again I have
[56:44] not received that seed or you receive it
[56:47] but you kick it out because remember you
[56:51] can and then you get to this part and
[56:53] then remember you go to where it's a dry
[56:55] land and then you go to where this
[56:57] happens and that happens and you die
[57:01] remember in the sower of the seed
[57:02] there's different different stages he
[57:06] staggered not at the promise of God
[57:07] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[57:09] giving glory to God and being fully
[57:12] persuaded that what he had promised he
[57:15] was able also to perform and therefore
[57:19] it was imputed or reckoned or counted to
[57:21] him for righteousness
[57:23] now it was not written for his sake
[57:26] alone that it was imputed to him
[57:29] but for us also to whom it shall be
[57:34] imputed if we look if we believe because
[57:38] listen many people who the dawn of time
[57:42] are from the time the Bible was written
[57:45] or the time even that Abraham comes on
[57:47] the scene many people have read
[57:49] Abraham's story and not got one thing
[57:52] from it right now I got one thing from
[57:56] just a good story it's a good story
[57:58] about a man and all you know we had to
[58:00] have a prophet to come and tell us that
[58:02] God changed their body because it's not
[58:04] written fully in the Bible that God
[58:07] changed their body but now being in the
[58:09] end time you and I look at that it
[58:11] huiqian that because that's our promise
[58:14] what promise Martin Luther to get the
[58:16] body changed when promise Wesley get the
[58:18] body change it was promised for us to
[58:21] take a body change so God had to through
[58:23] a prophet show us it's already in the
[58:25] Bible so they could receive the promised
[58:29] son but for us also to whom it shall be
[58:32] imputed our wreck
[58:33] and if we believe on him that raised up
[58:35] Jesus our Lord from the dead now let's
[58:39] go to Genesis 18 that's where we were at
[58:41] last Wednesday night cover it just a few
[58:44] minutes then we'll get to Genesis 22
[58:49] maybe we'll get finished with that just
[58:52] a few minutes this 202 12 ok chapter 18
[58:57] we won't go to it just stay right there
[58:58] because we're gonna read a quote from
[58:59] who's this Melchizedek because I wanted
[59:01] to come back we were explaining this
[59:03] Wednesday and for those that may be or
[59:05] not that are watching in that maybe
[59:09] doesn't know anything about the prophet
[59:11] of God that we had in the end time and
[59:12] all that we had a prophet come and tell
[59:14] us he was identified in the scripture
[59:17] identified in the Word of God all the
[59:19] way through the Word of God has been the
[59:21] church days being a messenger to bring
[59:23] us what clarity clarity he didn't bring
[59:27] us a new Bible he didn't bring us a we
[59:30] didn't have to do like the Mormons and
[59:32] have to write a new Bible no he gave us
[59:35] clarity for the Bible that we already
[59:37] have all right and gives us not an idea
[59:45] cuz if I didn't bring the quote I'm
[59:47] gonna tell you what brother Ram said do
[59:50] you know when Abraham when Isaac looks
[59:56] at you said it this morning when Isaac
[59:58] looks at Abraham and says daddy here's
[1:00:01] the wood here's the fire but where's the
[1:00:05] sacrifice brother Bryan said that was an
[1:00:09] Abraham that spoke when he said God son
[1:00:14] God Himself will provide a sacrifice he
[1:00:21] said that was God speaking through
[1:00:23] Abraham and there was the realm because
[1:00:28] remember look Abraham didn't have any
[1:00:30] creative power Abraham in itself
[1:00:31] couldn't create so what he spoke through
[1:00:35] I hope I got it in here maybe I did I
[1:00:38] read so many it's like 127 quotes for
[1:00:40] brother and talks about them going up on
[1:00:42] the mountain so let's just read this
[1:00:43] real quick
[1:00:44] I'm stay right there Dennis
[1:00:46] chapter 18 the Lord appeared to Abraham
[1:00:49] now what was this this was a man this
[1:00:53] was not that's what I'm going to say
[1:00:55] about the people there there's that one
[1:00:57] school of thought that Melchizedek was
[1:00:59] just a myth or that Melchizedek was a
[1:01:03] priesthood which we see that even in the
[1:01:06] end time now they have people out there
[1:01:08] that are under the Melchizedek
[1:01:09] Priesthood but now we must read in the
[1:01:13] Bible though where Paul picks it up the
[1:01:16] great Apostle Paul and he tells us he
[1:01:18] says this man doesn't have a father
[1:01:22] doesn't have a mother doesn't have a
[1:01:24] beginning of days doesn't have an end of
[1:01:27] days he said so obviously whoever that
[1:01:30] person was is still here today so it had
[1:01:33] to be a person not priesthood so so what
[1:01:37] did Abraham meet he met God in human
[1:01:42] flesh a pre figure of the Son of Man
[1:01:45] because remember hold on a minute that
[1:01:48] son of man we were promised had to be
[1:01:50] born like we were born Melchizedek
[1:01:56] wasn't it was a body spoken into
[1:01:58] existence but it was still taught in
[1:01:59] human flesh but that wasn't our brother
[1:02:02] that wasn't our Savior but now down
[1:02:04] inside was our Savior
[1:02:06] there's a little you be little technical
[1:02:08] there it was the same person theophany
[1:02:11] person but not the same flesh because
[1:02:13] that flesh that died for me and you had
[1:02:16] to come the way we came no sex though
[1:02:18] but God placed the womb in the womb of
[1:02:21] egg in the germ and there was a body
[1:02:24] that come on people it didn't come from
[1:02:27] nobody on earth but yet it was a human
[1:02:33] body that grew older had to go to the
[1:02:35] bathroom had to eat cried had had a
[1:02:38] gurney but down inside of him was that
[1:02:42] same man who spoke to Abraham because
[1:02:43] remember he said before Abraham was I am
[1:02:46] so he was identifying that that
[1:02:49] Melchizedek that was standing in front
[1:02:51] of Abraham was a pre figure brother
[1:02:53] Brent says of Jesus Christ but that
[1:02:56] flesh remember that's not our Savior
[1:02:58] standing there
[1:03:01] the man inside is but now that is God in
[1:03:04] human flesh because brother Ram says
[1:03:06] that the Son of man has to appear
[1:03:08] reappear in the end time to talk to
[1:03:11] Abraham seed so who has gotten human
[1:03:16] flesh we're not looking for another man
[1:03:17] to come we're looking at men and sisters
[1:03:21] that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:22] sometimes we forget them because if
[1:03:25] their God in human flesh they're part of
[1:03:26] the Son of Man ministers brother Dale
[1:03:28] was talking about this morning I say not
[1:03:31] ministry up here I mean the son of man
[1:03:34] ministry in the end time they're covered
[1:03:36] under that son of man ministry which is
[1:03:38] what God human flesh but remember as we
[1:03:41] say before that this great person was
[1:03:44] not a myth it was God no more no less it
[1:03:50] was God Almighty standing there in human
[1:03:52] flesh talking to Abraham because
[1:03:54] remember the Bible
[1:03:55] a myth Kania cow even if the - II can't
[1:04:00] eat a cow remember remember what they if
[1:04:03] this doesn't help you God help you to
[1:04:07] see it when brother Brown went across
[1:04:09] that curtain of time what's the first
[1:04:10] thing they said we don't eat here that's
[1:04:14] what the Alpha knee the Alpha knees
[1:04:17] don't eat
[1:04:18] so for Melchizedek to commune with
[1:04:22] Abraham he had to get in human flesh hey
[1:04:26] man so it had to be a human man standing
[1:04:29] in front of him that when he ate the
[1:04:34] calf you say where did it go it went
[1:04:37] side of him he had a stomach but when he
[1:04:40] dropped that flesh and stepped over back
[1:04:42] into that faster dimension he went right
[1:04:45] back to the theophany that didn't need
[1:04:48] to eat didn't have to eat but what is he
[1:04:51] doing now
[1:04:51] he's showing like I said the first quote
[1:04:55] he's showing that the sons of Abraham
[1:04:58] the seed has to come face to face with
[1:05:02] God in human flesh
[1:05:03] in the end times everybody agree with
[1:05:05] that same am I agree with it I mean
[1:05:07] that's just what he's got to be remember
[1:05:09] he washed his feet he fed him then here
[1:05:12] comes as
[1:05:13] this man says I will certainly return
[1:05:15] unto the according to the time of life
[1:05:17] so God it had to be God cuz they're set
[1:05:21] ninety nine year-old Abraham
[1:05:23] they're set 99 or eighty nine year-old
[1:05:26] Sarah she was dead anyway
[1:05:29] womb was and this man sitting here it's
[1:05:34] talking to them too and looking them
[1:05:36] both in the eye of course Sarah goes
[1:05:38] back in the tent but he says hey look I
[1:05:41] will visit you I will
[1:05:47] Abram couldn't do it Abraham me Abraham
[1:05:49] couldn't do it I will certainly return
[1:05:52] unto the according to time of life and
[1:05:54] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and then
[1:05:58] of course Sarah sniggered Sarah laugh
[1:06:02] within her heart saying am i waxed old
[1:06:03] shall I have pleasure my lord being old
[1:06:06] also you know you know what I'm talking
[1:06:08] about and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:06:11] wherefore it why did Sarah laugh saying
[1:06:13] shall surely bear a child it's anything
[1:06:16] too hard for the Lord boy he just cut it
[1:06:20] off right there is anything too hard for
[1:06:22] the Lord but see remember Abraham had a
[1:06:26] revelation of who that person was Sarah
[1:06:29] may not have had a revelation exactly of
[1:06:31] who that person was but under but
[1:06:34] remember brother brother Brown said
[1:06:35] Abraham said that God would have killed
[1:06:37] Sarah
[1:06:38] look how there Abraham them being Christ
[1:06:42] showing Christ standing there as what
[1:06:45] the male with the weaker female behind
[1:06:48] him doubting but I'm sure that the next
[1:06:52] day or two
[1:06:53] abraham looked at Sara and said you were
[1:06:56] that close to dying but see this is the
[1:07:01] way I see it Abraham looked at Sara said
[1:07:04] but you can't die there's nothing you
[1:07:09] can do if we can see that God has turned
[1:07:17] his brother said you can do nothing
[1:07:21] they'll cause you to die
[1:07:24] I'm gonna bring that promise God said
[1:07:27] he's gonna bring that promise to me in
[1:07:29] you oh praise the Lord through last and
[1:07:34] his transferred from Abraham that faith
[1:07:36] in Abraham Christ is nothing but faith
[1:07:39] but he has to transfer it to a bride so
[1:07:43] that she can believe is anything too
[1:07:47] hard for God Lord said shall I hide
[1:07:51] anything from Abraham we're at the end
[1:07:55] time folks
[1:07:56] God can't hide anything from us we have
[1:08:00] the open book and we know that later on
[1:08:05] the baby was born but let's read this in
[1:08:07] number 8 who is this Melchizedek 1965
[1:08:10] and just let him explain who this person
[1:08:13] was think of this great person of how
[1:08:16] great this man must be and now the
[1:08:18] question is who is this man
[1:08:20] theologians has had different ideas but
[1:08:23] since the opening on the Seventh Seal
[1:08:25] look the opening of the seven seals the
[1:08:28] mysterious book that's been mysterious
[1:08:30] to us
[1:08:30] according to revelations 10 1 through 7
[1:08:33] all the mysteries this wrote in this
[1:08:34] book it's been hid down through the age
[1:08:36] of the reformers it's supposed to be
[1:08:38] brought out into view by the angel of
[1:08:40] the last churches how many knows that
[1:08:42] say men congregation says they're men
[1:08:44] that's right supposed to be brought all
[1:08:47] the mysteries of the mysterious book is
[1:08:49] to be revealed to the Laodicean
[1:08:52] messenger of that age seeing there is
[1:08:54] much dispute about this person in this
[1:08:57] subject I think it behooves us to break
[1:09:00] into it to find out who this is now
[1:09:06] there are several schools of thought on
[1:09:08] him one of the schools are claims he's
[1:09:09] just a myth he wasn't actually a person
[1:09:11] well the Bible says a man and that man
[1:09:13] ate a calf and that man talked to
[1:09:15] Abraham so it was definitely a person it
[1:09:20] can't be that no I'm the other say it
[1:09:22] was the priesthood that was the
[1:09:24] Melchizedek Priesthood like I said
[1:09:25] before if you'll pull up milk as it
[1:09:27] priesthood there's people in the country
[1:09:29] that build religion our religion on
[1:09:31] saying that they're part of the
[1:09:33] Melchizedek Priesthood just like that
[1:09:35] people are now saying that
[1:09:37] they're under the spirit of Elijah
[1:09:39] that's not one person not the melikhaya
[1:09:41] four is not one person is the spirit see
[1:09:44] what they do they're dividing it out we
[1:09:46] know that's not true it was a priesthood
[1:09:49] that's the Melchizedek Priesthood that's
[1:09:51] the most likely one look brother Brown
[1:09:53] says that's the most likely one that
[1:09:55] holds better to that side than they do
[1:09:57] to the other
[1:09:58] it's because they say it was the
[1:10:00] priesthood now watch it can't be that
[1:10:02] for in the first first first fourth
[1:10:05] first it says he was a person a man so
[1:10:08] in order to be a person has to be a
[1:10:10] personality a man not an order but a
[1:10:12] person so he was not just a priesthood
[1:10:15] order neither was his myth he was a
[1:10:18] person and the person is eternal if you
[1:10:24] notice he had no father no mother no
[1:10:26] time he ever began he had no time he
[1:10:31] ever ended and ever who it was it's
[1:10:34] still alive tonight because the Bible
[1:10:38] said here that he had neither father and
[1:10:41] a mother beginning of days or ending of
[1:10:43] life let me ask you a question I was
[1:10:46] reading this the other day and I've been
[1:10:48] reading about Joshua so I went to Joshua
[1:10:51] Joshua it means Jehovah Savior which
[1:10:53] he's a type of Christ right right
[1:10:56] you know who he was the son of who was
[1:10:59] he the son of nun anybody get that
[1:11:06] anybody get that he was the son of nun
[1:11:10] no father no mother no beginning of days
[1:11:13] no ending of life Joshua the son of nun
[1:11:18] is that okay I'm that's the way I see it
[1:11:21] when you look at Joshua Jehovah Savior
[1:11:24] our type of Christ's leading and putting
[1:11:26] everybody in position didn't have a
[1:11:28] father a mother now Jesus Christ brother
[1:11:31] right now you said Jesus Christ now you
[1:11:32] look at Jesus Christ and he's he had a
[1:11:35] father and a mother and now you have to
[1:11:37] be careful with that one but this man
[1:11:40] that were talking about here he had no
[1:11:41] father no mother no time he ever began
[1:11:44] he had no time he ever ended everything
[1:11:46] it was it still here tonight because the
[1:11:47] Bible said he I need the father the
[1:11:48] mother begin
[1:11:49] lasering a wife so it had to have to be
[1:11:51] an eternal person so now let me ask you
[1:11:56] a question if the son of man is supposed
[1:11:58] to be prevalent in the end time what are
[1:12:00] we looking for an eternal person if
[1:12:07] you're born again tonight you are any
[1:12:08] pearl person an eternal person so it
[1:12:12] could only be one person and that's God
[1:12:14] because he's the only one that's eternal
[1:12:18] amen so God revealed himself to Abraham
[1:12:25] after the circumcision after he come to
[1:12:28] a place to where he he knows that when
[1:12:31] he looks at Abraham and says Abraham
[1:12:33] Abram you're gonna be changed to Abraham
[1:12:35] and here's Sarah your wife and you two
[1:12:39] are going to have this promise child
[1:12:43] abraham believed God the Bible says and
[1:12:48] it was imputed or reckoned to him for
[1:12:50] righteousness
[1:12:51] all right cuz God didn't tell him he's
[1:12:54] gonna have him by anybody else he said
[1:12:55] you like I said before if we can believe
[1:12:58] that that the promise is made that we're
[1:13:00] going to bring the promised child just
[1:13:03] as Ruth come through what four stages
[1:13:06] three stages and then what was the last
[1:13:09] stage of Ruth we'll get into it next
[1:13:10] Sunday the last stage of Ruth was Ruth
[1:13:14] getting what a reward the fourth stage
[1:13:18] is a reward for going through the other
[1:13:21] three stages the fourth stage is getting
[1:13:25] a reward of coming to here to where God
[1:13:30] can use you just like right here in
[1:13:31] Genesis 22 now we need to go to Genesis
[1:13:35] 22 physically go to Genesis chapter 22
[1:13:40] so if you'll pull Genesis chapter 22 up
[1:13:48] we'll go through this and read it give
[1:13:51] him a minute they'll probably understand
[1:13:53] we get it all right look
[1:13:57] and it came to pass after the-- after
[1:14:00] these things you look at so many times
[1:14:01] God writes in the Bible after these
[1:14:04] things what after these thing he's put
[1:14:06] us through he's put us through tests and
[1:14:08] trials and all these different things
[1:14:10] and Abraham coming through these
[1:14:12] different things and look all the
[1:14:17] different things that go on but now
[1:14:18] watch in chapter 22 look the offering of
[1:14:20] ossie this is where God has let you walk
[1:14:23] through your Christian journey for years
[1:14:25] and you've grown up with the child and
[1:14:28] you've got to know the child he ain't a
[1:14:30] child anymore he's grown up I'm talking
[1:14:34] about you you've grown up
[1:14:36] you've learned to trust Papa God you've
[1:14:39] learned but God's going to make sure
[1:14:43] that you're sure that you're sure
[1:14:47] everybody got there he's gonna make sure
[1:14:50] he he not he knew Abraham was going to
[1:14:55] kill that child because he was coming
[1:14:58] down with the knife and the angel
[1:15:01] stopped him and God says now I know
[1:15:05] we'll reinterment God says I know now
[1:15:07] we're not gotten you before the
[1:15:09] foundation of the world
[1:15:11] but Abraham didn't know and here's our
[1:15:16] still example this is our fourth stage
[1:15:18] he's already been through three stages
[1:15:20] justification sanctification about
[1:15:22] tiffin the Holy Ghost having the seal of
[1:15:24] circumcision and God meeting him in
[1:15:26] human flesh and telling him what was
[1:15:28] going on and discerning the thoughts and
[1:15:30] intents of the heart
[1:15:31] you know even as Christians we always
[1:15:34] hinge on well you know when brother Dale
[1:15:36] is preaching or somebody's up here
[1:15:37] preaching him and he's in the center
[1:15:41] realized that certain things which is
[1:15:43] good but you know what even us with the
[1:15:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost we need to be
[1:15:51] trained we need to hear from God we need
[1:15:55] to have our feet stepped on because of
[1:15:57] the little some things that we do hey
[1:15:59] man got okay we
[1:16:01] still need that even when we're up here
[1:16:04] in the mature Park because it remember
[1:16:06] now look Abraham gave Sarah away after
[1:16:14] he got cell circumcision come on I got
[1:16:18] it right here
[1:16:20] Genesis 19 and 20 and 21 9 10 and 20
[1:16:25] even Scofield says Abraham's laps at
[1:16:29] career that's where you get the point
[1:16:32] where brother Brown says here's this old
[1:16:34] woman and old man making a 300 mile
[1:16:36] journey but remember God had already
[1:16:38] changed them back then they go down and
[1:16:40] they meet the Pharaoh who can have any
[1:16:43] woman he wants in the land and he looks
[1:16:45] at Sarah which is at that time like 90
[1:16:48] years old supposedly and brother Branham
[1:16:52] says that I said there's pharaohs and
[1:16:55] all that old grandma I just love her I
[1:16:57] think I'll take her to wife and he's got
[1:16:58] 300 beautiful women behind him know she
[1:17:01] had been changed back to a beautiful
[1:17:03] young woman when they made that trip but
[1:17:06] there was time that he lapsed right here
[1:17:09] Abraham Abraham there was still trash to
[1:17:15] remember and sister Shepards dream there
[1:17:16] was trash being put out what this right
[1:17:19] here cuz we get up to adoption you got
[1:17:23] to get up there to the top amen they
[1:17:31] came to pass after these things that God
[1:17:33] did tempt Abraham and said unto Him
[1:17:34] Abraham he said behold Here I am and he
[1:17:37] said take now thy son thine only son
[1:17:40] Isaac so not anymore not anything else
[1:17:44] did it happen anywhere I take Isaac then
[1:17:48] the only Son Jesus Christ was what the
[1:17:51] only begotten of the Father and then so
[1:17:55] take thine only son Isaac whom thou
[1:17:57] lovest and get the end of the land of
[1:18:00] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[1:18:03] offering upon one of the mountains which
[1:18:05] I will tell the earth now watch on a
[1:18:09] mountain on a mountain
[1:18:14] on a mountain on a mountain it's where
[1:18:19] God's going to tempt Abraham on a
[1:18:21] mountain after he's went through 12 or
[1:18:24] 14 or 15 years of going fishing with
[1:18:26] this boy and hunting with this boy and
[1:18:28] teaching him all the things and men
[1:18:30] that's my you know what Abraham said
[1:18:32] there's my promise now he can't become a
[1:18:38] father of Nations because now he's a
[1:18:40] young man now God's telling you to take
[1:18:43] that young man that you've been dealing
[1:18:44] with all this time and go up and killing
[1:18:49] Abraham look he didn't question him
[1:18:53] either Abraham rose up early in the
[1:18:56] morning
[1:18:57] saddle disaster took two of his young
[1:18:59] men with him and Isaac his son clave the
[1:19:02] wood for the burnt offering and rose up
[1:19:03] and went into the place of which God had
[1:19:05] told him hey brother Brown said watch
[1:19:08] this then on the third day after he went
[1:19:14] through justification sanctification
[1:19:15] baptism Holy Ghost
[1:19:17] on a higher plane that we don't have
[1:19:19] time to get into now but on the third
[1:19:21] day they weren't there read your Bible
[1:19:27] on the third day they weren't there they
[1:19:30] looked up and saw where they were going
[1:19:33] so after the baptism all the ghosts you
[1:19:36] got to go to that mountain you still got
[1:19:38] to go up to that mountain then on the
[1:19:41] third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:19:43] saw the place afar off and Abraham said
[1:19:48] unto his young men abide ye here with
[1:19:51] the ass and I'm the lad will go yonder
[1:19:54] and worship watch this and come again to
[1:19:58] you what at what a faith now in the back
[1:20:05] of his human mind he heard God tell him
[1:20:08] he's gonna take him up there one way and
[1:20:11] the boy ain't coming back right
[1:20:14] humanly he said go up there and
[1:20:16] sacrifice take him to that mountain and
[1:20:18] sacrifice him and you're not coming back
[1:20:22] down here
[1:20:25] watch but here's Abraham and the lad
[1:20:32] will go yonder and I and the lad will go
[1:20:34] yonder and worship now in order to
[1:20:37] worship you got to have a sacrifice so
[1:20:41] he's saying something here and it looks
[1:20:43] like he's contradicting itself but he's
[1:20:44] not he's going to worship having faith
[1:20:48] that God's going to give him another
[1:20:50] something to do another sacrifice or
[1:20:52] another animal watch and come again to
[1:20:57] you and after Abraham took the wood of
[1:21:00] the burnt offering and laid it upon
[1:21:02] Isaac in other words in a pre figure of
[1:21:05] Christ putting the cross the wood on his
[1:21:08] shoulders right we got to type Christ in
[1:21:12] this now because I think is the promise
[1:21:14] son if I got that say man don't go sleep
[1:21:17] on me then Abraham took the wood of the
[1:21:20] burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac
[1:21:22] his son and he took the fire in his hand
[1:21:25] who's the daddy the dead he's typing
[1:21:30] Almighty God he's got the fire you can't
[1:21:33] have a sacrifice without fire the Holy
[1:21:37] Ghost in fire he took the fire in his
[1:21:40] hand and a knife and they went both of
[1:21:42] them together and Isaac spake unto
[1:21:45] Abraham his father's and my father and
[1:21:47] he said here am I my son he said Behold
[1:21:50] the fire in the wood but where is the
[1:21:53] lamb for the burnt offering Abraham said
[1:21:58] my son look I miss quoted this I knew I
[1:22:02] did so I'm gonna get to it where I can
[1:22:03] really quote it what my son God will
[1:22:07] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:22:15] offering
[1:22:16] so they went both of them together God
[1:22:18] will provide himself a lamb now to me
[1:22:23] that's not saying God's gonna provide a
[1:22:24] lamb God will provide himself because
[1:22:27] that Lamb of God was God himself he
[1:22:30] provided himself
[1:22:31] that's what brother Branham saying and I
[1:22:33] don't know if I brought it or not we'll
[1:22:34] read it but he said that was and
[1:22:37] Abraham talking he said that was God
[1:22:40] speaking through Abraham as brother
[1:22:42] Del's talking about now here that's not
[1:22:44] just at the Lord that's not just after
[1:22:49] Lord that's the Abraham saying my son
[1:22:53] look how this adoption comes up where
[1:22:56] adoption remembers not thus saith the
[1:22:57] Lord
[1:22:58] adoption comes to you say my son God
[1:23:04] will provide himself a lamp can you just
[1:23:07] hear God standing there and all of a
[1:23:09] sudden the boy asked and then God just
[1:23:13] says out of the way Abraham you don't
[1:23:16] understand this at the moment but I'm
[1:23:18] gonna speak through you and it's gonna
[1:23:20] have to happen see what this is about
[1:23:22] coming to the adoption he's gonna speak
[1:23:24] to us and it's got to happen oh that's
[1:23:27] wonderful
[1:23:28] so they went both of them together and
[1:23:30] they came to the place which God had
[1:23:31] told him of and Abraham built an altar
[1:23:33] then laid the wood on in order and bound
[1:23:37] Isaac his son and laid him on the altar
[1:23:39] and I he doesn't say it was kicking and
[1:23:41] screaming he just laid him on the altar
[1:23:46] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:23:48] took the knife to slay his son and the
[1:23:50] angel of the Lord
[1:23:51] capital L Ord called unto him out of
[1:23:55] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[1:23:57] said here am I he said lay not thine
[1:23:59] hand upon the lad neither do thou
[1:24:01] anything unto him for now I know that
[1:24:05] thou fearest God seeing thou has not
[1:24:08] withheld thy son thine only son from me
[1:24:11] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:24:13] looked and behold behind him a ram
[1:24:15] caught in the thicket by his horns and I
[1:24:20] love what a commentator said about said
[1:24:23] look he was caught in a thicket of
[1:24:26] thorns because when Jesus went to the
[1:24:31] cross he had a crown of thorns called on
[1:24:36] his head
[1:24:37] cuz that types of Christ being crucified
[1:24:40] right in a thicket by his horns and
[1:24:42] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:24:43] offered him up for a burnt offering
[1:24:45] instead of his son and Abraham called
[1:24:47] the name of that place what Jehovah
[1:24:49] Jireh
[1:24:50] it is said to this day in the mount of
[1:24:54] the Lord it shall be seen and the angel
[1:24:58] Lord called unto Abraham out of the
[1:25:00] heaven the second time and said by
[1:25:02] myself have I sworn saith the Lord for
[1:25:05] because thou has done this thing and has
[1:25:07] not withheld thy son thine only son that
[1:25:09] in blessing I will bless thee and in
[1:25:12] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[1:25:14] the stars of the heaven and as the sand
[1:25:16] which is upon the sea shore and thy seed
[1:25:19] shall possess the gate of the enemies
[1:25:23] and in da seed shall all the nations of
[1:25:27] the earth be blessed
[1:25:28] and I believe brother Brown may be not
[1:25:30] indifferent but he says he says he was
[1:25:32] in Philadelphia one time he said see he
[1:25:34] said in thy seed shall all of
[1:25:37] Philadelphia be blessed and then he was
[1:25:39] another place in Los Angeles he said now
[1:25:41] God said thy seed all nations all of Los
[1:25:45] Angeles shall be blessed same way--with
[1:25:48] here today because what thou hast obeyed
[1:25:52] my voice obeyed my voice everybody got
[1:26:00] that say Amen
[1:26:02] but now remember the story continues on
[1:26:06] but let's stop right here and read a
[1:26:08] couple of quotes from brother Branham
[1:26:09] number nine we'll be doing right here 9
[1:26:12] and 10 all right 7 compound names of
[1:26:15] Jehovah now when he appeared to Abraham
[1:26:17] in the form he said no Abraham I give
[1:26:19] you this little boy Isaac just a sweet
[1:26:21] little chap of about 16 years old don't
[1:26:24] tell his mother but I want you to I'm
[1:26:26] gonna make you a great blessing out of
[1:26:27] this boy I'm gonna bless all nations I
[1:26:30] promised you this for 25 years now and
[1:26:34] you've waited till Isaac's born now I
[1:26:36] tell you what I want you to do with
[1:26:38] Isaac I want you to take him up there
[1:26:40] and kill him now you go on back in the
[1:26:43] mountains to a place where I'll show you
[1:26:45] and then you kill him back there when
[1:26:48] our Abraham didn't question God he
[1:26:51] knowed that God promised that through
[1:26:53] that boy he would bless all nations and
[1:26:55] if God was going to bless them whether
[1:26:58] he was dead or alive he'd do it that's
[1:27:00] all and it had to come through there so
[1:27:03] God was able to keep his promise so he
[1:27:06] gets up the next morning got a couple of
[1:27:07] servants saddled a mule and he and the
[1:27:09] boy and the servant went on by and way
[1:27:11] back three days journey think how far
[1:27:14] back in the wilderness now remember let
[1:27:16] you in your journey and you've got
[1:27:17] continuing your journey so they went to
[1:27:21] this mountain they told the servants now
[1:27:23] you watch this little mule for me my boy
[1:27:25] huh are going up on this mountain and
[1:27:27] we're going to worship and the boy and I
[1:27:29] will return he says that twice the boy
[1:27:33] and I will return he was going to kill
[1:27:35] him how's he going to he didn't know but
[1:27:38] God had promised somehow see now let's
[1:27:42] read this last one will be doing
[1:27:43] musicians get ready to come possession
[1:27:46] the gates of the enemy and in Genesis 22
[1:27:48] 15 we read and the angel the Lord called
[1:27:50] today brahim out of heaven in a second
[1:27:52] time he said by myself have I sworn
[1:27:54] saith the Lord for because thou has done
[1:27:57] this thing thou hast not withheld thy
[1:27:59] son thine only son then blessing I will
[1:28:02] bless them multiplying I will multiply
[1:28:03] thy seed as the stars of heaven and as
[1:28:06] the sand upon the seashore as I seed
[1:28:08] shall possess the gate of his enemy and
[1:28:10] in thy seed shall all the nations of the
[1:28:13] earth be blessed because thou has obeyed
[1:28:14] my voice now may the Lord at his
[1:28:16] blessing to the reading his word and I
[1:28:18] would like to take if you should be
[1:28:20] called a subtext my subject this morning
[1:28:22] first is testing before promise gates
[1:28:25] and the subject is possessing the
[1:28:28] enemy's gaze and this is what he said
[1:28:29] God had been testing the patriarch
[1:28:32] because he had given him a promise and
[1:28:34] when God gives you a promise he's going
[1:28:35] to test you and when God makes a promise
[1:28:38] he wants to be sure that that person is
[1:28:41] worthy of the promise before he fulfills
[1:28:45] what he said or what he promises so
[1:28:47] Abraham had been promised that through
[1:28:50] his seed the whole world would be
[1:28:52] blessed that he'd have a son and this
[1:28:54] son out of him would come forth the seed
[1:28:56] now that's capital a so we know he's
[1:28:58] talking about Christ that would bless
[1:29:00] the whole earth and Abraham when the
[1:29:02] promise was given to him was 75 years
[1:29:04] old and Sarah his wife was 65 but the
[1:29:08] Bible tells us that Abraham staggered
[1:29:10] not at the promise of God through
[1:29:11] unbelief but with strong giving praise
[1:29:14] to God in God time after time tested him
[1:29:17] but
[1:29:17] he come to that final test before the
[1:29:21] blessing was going to happen I believe
[1:29:23] that's where we're at today that final
[1:29:25] test before the blessing will come to
[1:29:29] the people to us the seed of Abraham
[1:29:31] that's the way it is with all the seed
[1:29:34] of Abraham God gives us that final test
[1:29:38] just before he gives the promise and if
[1:29:42] it's possible I'd like to say something
[1:29:44] here personally but I'll withhold that
[1:29:47] that final test to see how you'll react
[1:29:50] upon it and when you had given Abraham
[1:29:53] hid this test he found Abraham just as
[1:29:57] true as he was when he started that's
[1:30:02] what he's looking for now people that
[1:30:04] are as true as it was when this thing
[1:30:07] started musicians come next Sunday if
[1:30:12] you want to read the Book of Ruth you
[1:30:13] can we'll talk about Ruth would be the
[1:30:14] same thing because the route goes
[1:30:16] through deciding Ruth goes through
[1:30:19] serving Ruth goes through resting and
[1:30:21] Ruth goes through rewarding Abraham or
[1:30:25] Abram went through deciding to leave his
[1:30:28] place and go with God serving God in the
[1:30:31] capacity that nobody else has served
[1:30:33] them before Cathy just got up and walked
[1:30:34] with God then number three were where
[1:30:37] Jesus says come use all waiver and
[1:30:40] heavy-laden and I'll give you rest
[1:30:41] brother Brahm said that's the new birth
[1:30:43] it's not a day a rest of the believers
[1:30:46] in new birth so so Ruth group what did
[1:30:49] Ruth do um she rested and what happened
[1:30:52] Boaz went and did the work so we know
[1:30:54] its god doing the work not us and then
[1:30:57] and then what was she rewarded with at
[1:31:00] the end she was rewarded with a child
[1:31:04] through Boaz and then that child was
[1:31:08] given to Naomi and we'll see that how
[1:31:12] that types Sunday so god bless you
[1:31:14] that's what the four stages of Abraham's
[1:31:17] journey justification Saints kasing
[1:31:19] baptism the Holy Ghost and then getting
[1:31:21] rewarded by the promised son going to
[1:31:24] the next stage or going to the adoption
[1:31:26] part where Abraham now believes
[1:31:31] now sure he believed before but your
[1:31:33] faith has built more and more as you
[1:31:35] keep going listen one thing's for sure
[1:31:38] before we before we sing
[1:31:40] God will never devalue your faith Satan
[1:31:46] will
[1:31:47] in other words Satan will make you doubt
[1:31:50] now God's never gonna make you doubt
[1:31:52] your faith now he's gonna put you
[1:31:53] through something like you did Abraham
[1:31:55] but he's not what did he do he built he
[1:31:58] did that to build Abraham's faith he's
[1:32:01] never gonna do anything to make you
[1:32:04] doubt your faith that's not God he won't
[1:32:08] shoot what he's going to give you a
[1:32:09] little test that tests your faith but
[1:32:12] what did it do to Abraham it made him a
[1:32:14] better person same way with you now it
[1:32:16] makes you a better person as you walk as
[1:32:18] you want with God it just keeps more and
[1:32:20] more and more and more making you a
[1:32:23] better person so god bless you let's

[1:37:47] that mountain he said I've been through
[1:37:49] all this journey I've been through every
[1:37:51] bit of that and I think in his human
[1:37:53] mind he thought all the way back to that
[1:37:55] day that God called him in career when
[1:37:58] he was Abram and he said Abram walk then
[1:38:03] he said Abram walk before me and be
[1:38:04] perfect then Abram you have nothing to
[1:38:07] do with this I'm going to now make you
[1:38:09] Abraham and I'm gonna give you a sign
[1:38:11] that I'm with you and then I'm gonna
[1:38:14] give you the promised son when I come
[1:38:16] and meet you in human flesh and then now
[1:38:18] you're standing on top of a mountain and
[1:38:20] God provided himself God went to Calvary
[1:38:25] and provided himself a sacrifice for
[1:38:27] each one of us to be able to start the
[1:38:30] journey and to continued all the way to
