TRANSCRIPT
========================================
she says all is well and they're giving her medicine and running tests but she's at home today because of the medicine they're giving her and she said she got a little bit of a stubborn Spirit about not able to take the medicine and so she listened to for the baby in brother Rayner preached why and at the end somewhere in the tape he said some some people get such a stubborn attitude when the doctor gives them medicine they don't want to take it so she said I'm taking the medicine now but I don't want to um but anyway she's she says all is well but she just needs prayer for her faith and sanctification for the medicine and all is well and found out what it was no not yet they're still looking for the reason oh man all right last time we uh we continued on looking through Genesis Genesis chapter four and I think we made it to we were on the first five Genesis chapter four let's go ahead and read through those verses I'm I'm probably only going to get to maybe verse 10 today so let's go ahead and read through those just to pick up where we were Adam knew Eve his wife if she could see the bear came and said I have gotten a man from the Lord but she again buries brother Abel Abel was a keeper of sheep Cain was the daughter of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that came brought on the fruit of the ground and offered him to hold and Abel he also brought the first things of his Flocka and the Lord had respect of Abel and to hit to his offering but unto cane into his offering he had not respected and Cain was very Roth and his countenance failed so last time we were talking about how um staple brought his sacrificed by faith and God Vindicated the sacrifice that it was true that his message that you must bring a sacrifice was true and then we started talking about how God Vindicated the prophet's message and how he Vindicated a Believer and um we were looking at uh just kind of taken the story of how Rahab saw the children of Israel coming out of the Wilderness and she saw the pillar of Fire coming first and how the pillar of fire leads the believer and have indicated a Prophet by you know it was a photograph was taken on the pillar of fire and then the next thing we were going to look at was the Ark of the Covenant which is the word the spirit leading the word and the spirit of the word uh leading the believer so let's um let me get my quotes now the way there's there's lots of ways that you could say how brother bearings have indicated about the all the all the different the many wonderful amazing things but um you know Christ was revealed in Simplicity and what a lot of people overlooked is that a true prophet and a True Believer are both Vindicated because they stay with the word and uh you know when Joshua told the children originally when they were crossing the river Jordan stay close to the heart because you haven't gone this way before so um you know we're we're crossing uh the River Jordan the Rapture too and uh it's it's crucial to stay close to the word because we haven't gone this way before um so let me just read some quotes from brother and said the size of his tummy he said but the true prophet how you'll Mark him he will stay with the word always the president stays in my Ministry he said he was talking about Paul now everything forsaken him Paul but it was at this time that God stepped in on the scene because any man that knows the word will stay with the word knowing that the word is God and God's power to transform he said True predestinated Believers will stay with the word because they are part of that order and one as he said that's when he said in his church that's what he said he would do believes the word not the Creed not the Dogma but the word and by doing this he shows himself in them by confirming his word making the same life that he lived once live over again bring his word to pass and I just I was thinking about you know how God through brother Brandon he revealed to us the Mysteries that are in the Bible so they could be revealed at us oh he got he was the prophet was identified in the scripture and we are identified in this scripture because what's written in the scripture has to come to pass in our lives what's predicted in the scripture about him he the scripture predicted that they would have Prophet a prophet would come on the scene in Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 all the many scriptures we know but also predicted that there'll be people that would believe it and I I was reading the scripture where he said the same Pillar of Fire the same God that led you led me here to preach to you tonight is the same God that leads you here to hear me um so we're we're identified with the message five different identifications of the True Church of the Living God he said somebody had seen him somebody was trying to tell him about it and they did not believe it if that isn't the same thing today we know he lives we have the witness of your spirit in us we see his power move over the audiences and tens of thousands of people discern their thoughts thoughts and hearts just exactly like he did when he was here like the Bible said the word of God if he is the word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the world was made flesh and grown Among Us the word of God is sharper more powerful than a two-way sword cutting even to the mirror of the bone and discern of the thoughts and intense of the heart Christ The Works that I do show you also see him doing that how many seen him do it sure we know he doesn't he lives here he's in our hearts you know I I believe a real True Believer when they when they hear something if if maybe you don't understand that you'll always take it back to the word that's what brother Brown said when an angel came and when the angel came and told him something he didn't just say okay that's the truth he took it back and proved it by the word right that's that's the a Vindication of a True Believer is not just saying yeah that's that's the truth but let me go prove it why I'm against organized release and he said now look this message of the day just can't be something saying we got the truth and we got this that it has to be foretold in his word and then after the word is brought forth it has to be properly Vindicated by the word why I'm against organized organized religion now if you go to The Seventh-Day Adventists say we got her just keep the Sabbath you show me that in the scriptures Miss Eddie baker said she had it show it to me Jehovah Witness said they had to show it to me see methodists say they got it show it to me Baptists say they got it show it to me show me any organizations I'm proving to you that they are every one out of the will of God every one of them contrary teaching traditions of man instead of the word of God I don't know one of them that would accept the things that's really written in the Bible the way it is that's right but when somebody comes by and said I got the message of the day he must properly be seen first and foretold to come when John the Baptist walked out there they said are you the Christ he said I'm not said are you the Elijah he said I'm not he said who are you he could identify himself he had the message of the hour he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness the word identifies the prophet the messenger and it identifies the believer persevere he said why it was the word that was in him God's word for that day see that's how they were Vindicated that was their credentials none of them belonged to an organization not one never did their credentials was their Ministry a prisoner he said people say it was a mental telepathy who would refuse such to come into their church and everybody permit you to mention one word of serpency eternal security and the things that the Holy Spirit has revealed and proved to be the word I mean challenge after challenge to come and prove this to be wrong they are um this uh this next quote from thirst I'm trying to move a little bit faster okay you know uh I'm about to share something a little personal with you this is kind of scary sometimes but I I want a few years ago the lord gave me a dream where I was talking to somebody about the the word and in the dream I saw um they were telling me something wrong and I saw that groom in my heart and uh out of the side arm came with a hammer and every time that would speak that arm would swing and hit that drum and it would go bloop Bloom like it wasn't sounding it was it was wrong in my dream I said that's not right because it doesn't work their record what's in my heart and I always wondered if that dream was true until I read this I heard brother Brown say this quote from thirst and then I thought comparing the deer with a man that's thirsting for God before the enemy gets there is something about a child of God that when you once are born into the spirit of God receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit there is something about the person that can sense the enemy you can take a man when he's taking the scripture and reading this scripture and try to inject something to that script this this contrary to the scripture a man that's filled the Holy Ghost can sense that right quick there's something out of the way when he gets into a place and that little certain sense in there that it's done to protect your life you mustn't you must never go for anything unless it's exactly the word of God you must stay right exactly with that word and now and we are secured with that sense as long as we are in the Holy Spirit now then you find a person get up there and say now that was for the apostolic age that now right quick if you ever see the Holy Spirit you've been endowed with that sins it sets it off there's something wrong there see they try to explain it away it is for another day that really you don't need those things today but Jesus said these things shall follow them to believe see there's a little something sits off in you a little buzzer and knowing that that's wrong and that's the way of this because Jesus said if we have one word to this or take one word from our part that's taken out of the Book of Life see not one scripture we must take it just the way it's written and God watches over his word to perform it and we know that it's got to be just right so therefore no matter what a church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of God you become part of the Bible God told Ezekiel he the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other and that's the believer when he receives the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible and the spirit of God is the word of God my words are Spirit In the Beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the world was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he is the same yesterday today and forever and when you are part of that word oh then let something come up contrary to that word there is a little buzzer sets off right quick it's just a warn you that death is in the road we should never do that there's also these that thirsts are just natural they are natural for the Christian they are natural for the human being so God gives us a little something to tell us when something is wrong and then when you hear something wrong you go back to the word and prove it because that's the Vindication of a True Believer he's going to take it back to the word and prove it just like brother random every time that angel would come he'd go back to the word and prove it now the next thing imagine Rahab looking out her window she's seeing the children of Israel coming out of the Wilderness the pillar of fires leading the Ark of the covenants with them all the children of Israel were gathered around the ark guarding it Matthew Martin Luke and John all around it coming out and then behind them comes the signs and wonders and they had they had an atonement a rock that was cleft they had the Brazen serpent that was a type of sand already judged and you know all the people think signs and wonders a lot of times are kind of like a magic trick but God gives us things when we need them their clothes never brought it off because they needed their clothes he gave them water out of that rock because they needed it all right the things that they had Nico he provided the faith that was once delivered to the Saints his Vindication was there his power was there there was a smitten Rock a brass Circle an atonement going before them with a sign of God other than what signs and wonders the same thing from Cain and Abel now not fundamental fundamental two but signs of following the Believers these signs shall follow them that believe ERS always have signs and wonders among them Jesus said in Saint Mark the 16th chapter these signs shall follow them to the end of the world they that believe and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth or not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it'll not harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and today the churches you preach that Doctrine they take the confirmation as a man that goes to church and they require a religious type of man Pays His ties a quarter to the church believes in the church brother that's no sign at all that's the world sign but God's sign is what he said it was and you know brother Branham had signs he had the two the two signs that were given as a witness the sign in the hand uh the sign of discernment and then you know he talked about how Moses had two sons also but the third sign was a lie to the believer and death to the unbeliever and you know if you look at Deuteronomy and I like this the word Deuteronomy means two laws if you obey God you live if you disobey God you die and we can see those two laws all the way from the beginning and eaten and in a second if we have time we'll take it all the way to emphasis to the Ephesian churches let's see what happened there but first let's go back to the Genesis story verse six and the Lord said unto King why are there a Roth and why is that counting Us Falling if thou do us well shall not be accepted and after I do it's not well send lines at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him now let's kind of split this up without taking a piece at a time if thou do us well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin life at the door now remember Cain had seen the fire of God fall on the evil sacrifice he saw it and just like in this day we've seen the Vindicated proof that this is true we've seen the other believers around us that their their testimony is true right and uh so let's just see what Robert has to say about this Divine Healing now he that willfully he that sins and what is sin unbelief he that will turn his back on Truth when it's presented to him there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin did you ever read it like that he that disbelieves the willfully after truth has been present to him because his church believes different that's when you cross the line he that sins a willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice that's because you've seen the sacrifice you've seen it right there in front of me and you turn your back on and say I don't I don't want there's no more sacrifice because that is a sacrifice God's power to transform he said why didn't why are you looking like that said if you'll do well go do like your brother is doing out there I'll receive you and bless you I'll do for you the same thing think about it he'll give you the same Holy Ghost baptism he'll give you the same leading of the Holy Spirit the word and you revealing the signs and wonders falling that's not in the quote but he just couldn't do it he said now if you don't sin of unbelief lies at the door God's power to transform but you see now notice what that done to Cain and it's going to do the same today and make Cain go away on will for willful sinner he willfully was disobedient every person will be the same way willfully disobedient after he had seen Abel's message so Vindicated of God that it was the truth and refused to do it done the same then then he crossed the dividing line now everybody's got a dividing line because God is such a gentleman that he'll call you and call you but if you turn it away he's very polite and he won't override your freedom on ways that's right that dream and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him how is their normal sacrifice because and brother Brian gives the example of that preacher who just Dives quickly yeah I remember the story of the uh I think it was he said Abraham Lincoln gave the pardon and the Man in the prison wouldn't he turned down the pardon and so they went ahead and uh executed it so if you turn down the pardon you rejected the pardon there's nothing that can be done for you because you've turned it down and you just paid to pay the sacrifice once for all for us all but he's not going to force any of us to receive it right right that's right now the question a lot of people when they were receiving the Holy Ghost looking to receive it I talked to a lot of young people that feel this way as the devil will tell you you send away your day of Grace and how did you know if you send away your day of Grace it's very simple if you don't want to come to Jesus you send away your day of Grace um I don't know if I I was looking at a quote and I had that quote in here was talking about a young lady and he said October that um if anybody needs that I'll I'll be back oh I know to leave shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him now in the New Testament we heard how Jesus was telling Peter Satan desires to Sifty like wheat but I prayed for you and this is really the same kind of thing if you if you will do like your brother then you'll roll over sin and death and Satan because you know if you're on God's side or Satan can't do one thing against you without the Lord's permission in chapter eight I mean sorry verse eight in chain talk with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him now what did Abel say to Cain let's turn to John chapter 8. and I this is probably won't be as far as yeah John chapter 8. verse 31. now I I just you know Jesus was the second Adam that said to correct all of the things that Adam brought into the world and I just imagined that the conversation must have gone like this because he's talking to well let's just read it then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then argue my disciples indeed dislike he told to Abel come do like or told the Cain come do like your brother Abel if you'll believe on my word and do then you'll uh be accepted and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how safe is thy you shall be made free and that was always people are always looking for genealogy to proved by your learnings that you're saying but we're not saved by Adam seed he got us into this man we're Saved By the Sea of the woman which is Christ Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the serpent of sin there's serpency right there of sin and the sermon abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the sun therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed I know that you're Abraham City but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the Deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God now a lot of people don't know this but the Jews have a history of teaching serpent seat they actually if you look back at what the early rabbis from uh about 2000 years ago or whatever their writings they taught that there were two atoms one with a soul and one without a soul and uh we don't have time to get all into that but they so that's they're telling them we know by this servancy business and we've been I've won a fornication we have one father even God Jesus said unto them of God we're your father and you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came out of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word year of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth Believe Me Not and we're at 25 minutes after the hour so I go ahead and stop right now
