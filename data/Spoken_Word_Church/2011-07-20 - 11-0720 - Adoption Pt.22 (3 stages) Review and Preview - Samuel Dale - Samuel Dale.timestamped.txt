[15:21] too don't you I believe we're seeing him
[15:23] through the opening of the word that's
[15:25] the main part where we at now because
[15:27] he's not here physically but he's here
[15:30] to reveal himself amen good to see
[15:32] everybody in the house of the Lord if
[15:33] you'd like turn in your scriptures turn
[15:35] where we've been reading in Ephesians 1
[15:38] and we're still in Romans
[15:40] 8 now what we want to do tonight is kind
[15:43] of have a kind of like a
[15:45] review back you know and pick up the
[15:49] message and bring it up to a place and
[15:53] then uh you know kind of where we're at
[15:55] and then uh talk about what we expecting
[15:58] to come are a future part of it the and
[16:01] we'll call it review and preview but
[16:04] it's still message number 22 on the
[16:06] adoption in three stages but I want to
[16:09] cover that with you and and to make sure
[16:11] we're lined up and you understanding
[16:13] what I'm saying you know and what I'm
[16:15] trying to bring to you and then that way
[16:18] we can go from there cuz there is some
[16:20] things that we are expecting to take
[16:22] place that's right and there is some
[16:24] things that we know have taken place
[16:26] that's right so somewhere in between
[16:28] there is where we're dwelling right and
[16:30] I'm happy about it had a good good time
[16:32] this past weekend with brother brother
[16:34] Keith Brown there and enjoyed his
[16:36] messages and things I hope that you
[16:38] enjoyed it and have a good time with him
[16:41] you know we really appreciate it amen
[16:43] Ephesians 1 Romans 8 our heavenly father
[16:47] we thank you Lord for most of all for
[16:50] being
[16:51] you and then being you then you can
[16:54] reveal yourself unto us we ask you to
[16:57] help us to understand because Lord we
[17:00] truly in this hour desire to see
[17:04] you with our spiritual lives because we
[17:08] we don't want to see you yet with our
[17:10] physical because we couldn't stand that
[17:13] it's why the prophet said even these
[17:14] bodies would have to be changed for us
[17:16] to meet you in the air so we we don't
[17:19] want that part others may be talking
[17:21] about but we don't want that part of it
[17:23] we want to have it our spiritual eyes
[17:26] opened unto the revealed word
[17:29] and Lord just be with us forgive our
[17:30] sins bless those that are sick among us
[17:33] remember Jeffrey there Lord with the the
[17:35] the problem with the the antibiotics or
[17:38] whatever it is causing his sickness and
[17:40] we ask you to just take care of that and
[17:42] let everything be all right we love you
[17:45] and we thank you guide us each one
[17:47] tonight as we speak about you then you
[17:49] come and speak unto us and lead us by
[17:52] thy Grace in Jesus name amen amen
[17:57] Ephesians
[17:59] one the next Minister visiting Minister
[18:02] will be brother Quinn will be the
[18:03] seventh I think it is of August
[18:07] is blessed be the God and father of our
[18:10] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[18:12] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[18:14] places in Christ according as he had
[18:17] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[18:20] of the world that we should be holy and
[18:22] Without Blame before him in love having
[18:25] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[18:27] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[18:30] according to the good pleasure of his
[18:31] will to the praise of the glory of his
[18:34] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[18:36] in the Beloved now let's go back to
[18:40] Romans 8 where we've read from and we'll
[18:43] read verse 8 through I mean verse uh 14
[18:46] through 23 for as many as are led by the
[18:49] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[18:52] for ye have not received the spirit of
[18:53] bondage again to fear but ye have
[18:55] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[18:57] we
[18:58] cry out by father the spirit itself
[19:01] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[19:02] are the children of God and if children
[19:05] then ours ours of God and join ours with
[19:07] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[19:10] that we may be also glorified together
[19:12] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[19:14] present time are not worthy to be
[19:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[19:17] revealed in us for the earnest
[19:20] expectation of the creature waited for
[19:22] the manifestation of the sons of God for
[19:24] the creature was made subject to vanity
[19:27] not willingly but by reason of him who
[19:29] has subjected to same in Hope because
[19:32] the creature itself also shall be
[19:34] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[19:36] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[19:38] children of God for we know that the
[19:40] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[19:43] pain together until now and not only
[19:46] they but ourselves also which have the
[19:48] first fruits of the spirit even we
[19:50] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[19:53] for the adoption to it the Redemption of
[19:56] our body man may be seated the Lord add
[20:00] his Blessing to the reading of the
[20:03] word now as I said I want to I want to
[20:07] review kind of you know come back start
[20:10] and come up and just put it in one
[20:12] message and review and then uh we will
[20:16] try to uh you know preview some things
[20:19] which means like get a preview of what
[20:21] to expect where we're at and what's
[20:24] going on and then to move on into what
[20:28] to expect now the prophet of God said
[20:30] when the bride realizes who she is and
[20:33] what she's doing here her purpose and
[20:35] things that she would be then you know
[20:39] uh as he would call it maybe in another
[20:40] place an invisible Invincible Army that
[20:44] would be able to walk off of this Earth
[20:47] in a Rapture all right but now we've
[20:51] been talking about
[20:54] adoption we've been talking about it in
[20:56] three stages which is like your new
[21:00] birth
[21:02] adoption and that's why Paul would say
[21:04] that in Romans 8:14 and all through
[21:07] there 15 and and you know being the
[21:10] spirit of
[21:11] adoption and showing who we are as the
[21:14] children of God you know and by the new
[21:17] birth we are
[21:19] ours and join ours with Jesus Christ by
[21:23] the new birth see we don't have to wait
[21:25] this is not a time in the end time to
[21:28] wait to come to something I believe
[21:30] that's our biggest problem and the basis
[21:33] of what I'll be preaching on for the
[21:34] next 6 months or 6 years I don't know
[21:37] which way we'll be on trying to get you
[21:40] and I to realize Who We
[21:43] Are by what God has said about us all
[21:47] right because that's the only way that
[21:50] we can do it and then we'll we'll try to
[21:52] cover a lot of things but see Paul said
[21:54] we've received the spirit of
[21:57] adoption see all right so that's the
[21:59] Holy Spirit when you receive the new
[22:01] birth all right now then there is a time
[22:06] of going from the new birth with the
[22:08] growth development of the stature of a
[22:10] perfect man Etc I'll say this again in
[22:13] just a minute but to just put you to a
[22:16] point to let you think about it and then
[22:19] coming out to the
[22:21] adoption and then you know that adoption
[22:24] being the manifestation of the Sons and
[22:26] Daughters of a living God
[22:28] and in comparison with the same as the
[22:31] Lord Jesus on a matter of
[22:33] transfiguration but then coming to to Wi
[22:37] as Paul said in verse 23 to to Wi to
[22:40] understand the Redemption of the body
[22:43] now I I want you to think about it cuz
[22:46] I've made this statement many times
[22:48] throughout the series uh if you'll
[22:50] notice I I haven't spoke about the uh
[22:55] basically the change of the body
[22:59] as much as we've been trying to talk
[23:01] about the Revelation right all right
[23:04] right now I hope everybody follows that
[23:06] because see to me the
[23:09] adoption the being in three
[23:12] stages is completed in the basis or or
[23:16] was to be completed in the basis of an
[23:22] understanding of the Redemption of the
[23:24] body see then will come the Redemption
[23:28] of the body see then will come the
[23:30] change then will come the things and
[23:32] I've asked you to look up those words
[23:34] and I won't get to it tonight or and
[23:36] probably W Sunday morning but maybe
[23:38] Sunday afternoon it's just according to
[23:40] how it goes cuz I'm just waiting I've
[23:42] asked you to look up the words glorified
[23:45] and uh you know translation and and
[23:48] remember to look up to what brother
[23:51] brandham says about those things and
[23:53] that way you know maybe we'll get into
[23:55] something all right but now
[23:58] you you follow me what I'm
[24:00] saying see the adoption in three
[24:03] stages is not taking you to the change
[24:07] right that is a
[24:09] fulfillment of what you've been going
[24:12] through all the time right you've been
[24:14] in that process from the time you
[24:17] received the New Birth when you received
[24:20] that new birth you you were in a process
[24:23] all right right being born again as
[24:26] Peter would say and even talking about
[24:29] the fact that when we receive the new
[24:32] birth that God laid claim on that body
[24:35] that you're living in that's right and
[24:38] see you're not to expect to get a new
[24:39] body or nothing like that because he's
[24:42] already laid climb to it that's right he
[24:45] gave you the new birth while you were in
[24:47] this body you know so why would he want
[24:50] to give you another body somewhere down
[24:53] the road see and that's why I don't
[24:55] believe that you know that the people
[24:57] understand the the point of what the
[24:59] prophet is trying to say that we don't
[25:02] get a new body it's this body made new
[25:04] you say well I know what the prophet
[25:06] said new new that's right but check all
[25:08] he's talking about that's right I
[25:10] believe in this body made new right amen
[25:14] because it's not going to be of the
[25:20] same let me rephrase I was fixing to say
[25:25] something but it's not going to be
[25:28] exactly like it is right because if this
[25:32] body is
[25:35] redeemed it would mean it would go
[25:39] back see and if it goes back it's got to
[25:42] have a place to go back to and if it
[25:44] goes back then uh there's something got
[25:47] to happen and we're not going to be and
[25:50] I hope you listen to what I'm saying uh
[25:54] this pull pit was a piece of wood at one
[25:56] time it has went through a process and
[25:59] brought it down to where that it is now
[26:02] and then by that process the it it has
[26:07] reached its goal and you and I one day
[26:10] will reach a place to where that we can
[26:12] be changed in a moment the twink of an
[26:14] eye and you'll see then why the prophet
[26:16] would say and they asked him said what
[26:18] is this great
[26:20] translation conduct order and Doctrine
[26:22] he said just to change right it just as
[26:25] simple he said just to change then he
[26:28] explained how that would taken place and
[26:30] we've been through that before but I I
[26:33] want you to stay with me tonight and
[26:35] let's just review a little all right see
[26:38] talking about adoption in three stages
[26:41] see first is your new birth all right
[26:45] now we know the story in case somebody
[26:47] hears it out you know and uh don't
[26:51] understand things uh the scripture said
[26:55] in John 1:11 that he came came to his
[26:58] own but his own received him not but as
[27:00] many as received him gave he power to
[27:01] become the sons of God see not all
[27:04] Israel is Israel right amen all right
[27:07] see it's not that way all right so then
[27:10] he came to his own to receive them and
[27:13] it would be then a a a kingdom to be set
[27:16] up and then that Kingdom would be
[27:19] different from what most people would be
[27:21] even thinking because even to we talk
[27:24] about adoption uh Romans 9 and4 you'll
[27:27] find that adoption pertained to the
[27:30] Israelites so does the covenants the
[27:33] Commandments the the oracles the the
[27:35] things see come to Israel why because he
[27:38] had to come that way to be what he's
[27:41] just what I just quoted from John that
[27:43] he would come to his
[27:46] own because Israel was his chosen people
[27:50] right in the Old Testament it was a
[27:53] people chosen now I'm going to preach on
[27:55] that the Lord willing Sunday uh on
[27:58] chosen maybe Sunday evening but anyhow
[28:02] Chosen and uh but it's not you know we
[28:06] want to keep the point of listening see
[28:10] adoption pertaineth pertain to
[28:13] them right they had to right they had
[28:16] the lineage they had the the promises we
[28:19] were Gentiles we didn't have any promise
[28:21] whatsoever that's right we had nothing
[28:23] now we had examples or types and shadows
[28:28] that like Rahab the Harlot and things
[28:30] like that down in the Old Testament
[28:32] while it was being done but still you
[28:34] got to remember one thing he was dealing
[28:36] strictly with them that's right all
[28:38] right cuz they were his people right now
[28:40] you could become a proelite unto the
[28:44] Jewish faith you know and things like
[28:47] that that was fine but that still didn't
[28:49] make you a chosen people of
[28:52] God like Israel was first in her
[28:55] beginning all right but see then when
[28:57] she rejected him that's
[29:01] right then it would show that he would
[29:05] now have to come to the Gentiles which
[29:08] Gentiles means Nations all right the the
[29:12] Israelites are in this Gentile Gentile
[29:15] means Nations it mean Russia China
[29:17] Israel uh whatever it just means
[29:20] Nations and see that was what he was
[29:22] showing in the tops and the Shadows that
[29:24] it was going to come to that as Paul
[29:26] said the mystery of the bringing in of
[29:30] the Gentiles right all right and in
[29:33] doing and bringing into to the
[29:35] Gentiles it would show what he was doing
[29:38] with Ruth and Boaz and all of the tops
[29:40] and shadows that it would come to pass
[29:42] but now remember this is a kingdom that
[29:45] he come to set
[29:46] up the natural Israelite people were
[29:50] looking for a king yep all right that's
[29:53] right they were looking for a messiah y
[29:55] absolutely they were looking looking for
[29:57] all of the promises of the Bible right
[30:01] to be fulfilled right right but when he
[30:04] came the way he came they wouldn't
[30:07] accept him had he rolled out as the
[30:09] prophet would refer to a carpet right
[30:11] down to and walk up to Kus and say oh
[30:14] cus boy you stayed with it you know
[30:15] you're really something and here I am
[30:17] now we're going to take over well Israel
[30:20] could have received that that was their
[30:23] idea but that was not God's plan amen
[30:27] because he come to set up a kingdom y a
[30:31] kingdom that would not be dealing with
[30:34] the natural flesh right amen right see
[30:38] this Kingdom I'm talking about the one
[30:40] that Jesus spoke of in the Matthew Mark
[30:41] Luke and John of the kingdom of God you
[30:44] know and the kingdom of heaven and all
[30:45] it's not speaking of these natural flesh
[30:49] beings it's speaking of a spiritual
[30:54] Kingdom see that he would be the head of
[30:56] that Kingdom om all right and then he
[30:59] would come down and be able to transmit
[31:03] into the human being that would be
[31:05] living in this domain or Kingdom you
[31:08] know transmit with inside of
[31:12] us the new birth right all right making
[31:16] us then the children of God now the
[31:20] prophet's right when he's saying that
[31:22] God adopted his own
[31:26] children
[31:28] cuz that's what he does cuz now he's
[31:30] moving it from bringing it into a birth
[31:33] he's bringing it through the development
[31:35] down through in the end time to the
[31:38] adoption stages all right amen but see
[31:41] get to Point what I'm saying we had to
[31:43] get the new birth but you know every
[31:46] Israelite right that ever got saved had
[31:49] to get the new birth right just because
[31:52] they were Israelites did not bring them
[31:55] the to Wi the red I mean did not bring
[31:57] bring to them the the spirit of adoption
[32:00] right that's right just because they
[32:03] were Israelites right now sure the day
[32:06] of
[32:07] Pentecost 120 were Israelites the 3,000
[32:11] outside were Israelites
[32:13] yes but see then immediately it changes
[32:16] to a gentile dispensation but to show
[32:19] that's what it was going to
[32:21] be you remember we tried to preach this
[32:24] many many years ago to show it was going
[32:26] to be a
[32:28] dispensation Jesus went around picking
[32:30] them out
[32:32] Peter James right John
[32:37] yep not as a nation right amen he wasn't
[32:41] comeing to deal as a nation then that's
[32:44] right see that the adoption would
[32:46] pertain
[32:47] unto the
[32:49] Israelites see all the promises and
[32:52] everything is to Israel but they
[32:54] rejected it all right right but he came
[32:57] to set up a kingdom the new birth amen
[33:00] that new birth BR brought you and I into
[33:04] the body of Christ that's right all
[33:07] right see then you got the growth
[33:09] development you got the stature of a
[33:10] perfect man you got the things to
[33:13] transpire that is taught there in the
[33:15] word and it you know the prophet
[33:17] preached those things unto us and we
[33:20] must not be just babies tossed to and
[33:22] fro with every little wind of Doctrine
[33:25] but we must grow in Grace and knowledge
[33:27] all that's written in the Bible amen all
[33:29] right but knowing and realizing then
[33:32] that something was
[33:35] missing those disciples had the faith of
[33:38] the fathers right amen all right you see
[33:41] that faith of the fathers glasting on
[33:43] down as the prophet would cover it on
[33:45] down into the fourth Church age right
[33:49] see when you would get down to Columba
[33:51] and all of those they would still be
[33:52] dealing with the faith of the fathers
[33:55] maybe getting smaller in amounts yes but
[33:57] still it was there for the people but
[34:00] then you seeing it as it's passing away
[34:02] and that was what Jesus said the corner
[34:04] of wheat must die and fall into the
[34:06] ground or it will abide alone speaking
[34:09] of himself but speaking then of what
[34:11] would happen to the church right all
[34:13] right see then we must be restored back
[34:16] to that faith of the
[34:18] fathers before we can even talk about a
[34:22] change of the body am are the things see
[34:27] all right then that's why that I've
[34:28] tried to cover it to you and and give
[34:31] you examples of showing you see that we
[34:34] started a new birth that's right Jesus
[34:37] started not having to have a new birth
[34:40] but receiving the baptism of the Holy
[34:42] Spirit on the River Jordan
[34:44] yes and God saying this is my beloved
[34:48] Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell all
[34:51] right see then when he gives you an i of
[34:53] a new
[34:55] birth you remember that that that he's
[34:57] still saying this is whom I'm pleased to
[34:59] dwell why because if he's not in you you
[35:02] don't have the new birth right and if
[35:05] he's in you then he's pleased to dwell
[35:07] in you or he wouldn't be in you right is
[35:10] that plain enough that's right but see
[35:13] that was what I was trying to get to
[35:14] point to us to where we could see it all
[35:16] right see then we have to to
[35:19] follow the prophet's message in the line
[35:22] of growth development bringing us from
[35:24] the New Birth being in the family of God
[35:28] now remember the family I'm talking
[35:30] about is a spiritual condition not a
[35:33] physical condition right if it was a
[35:36] physical condition you'd be required to
[35:39] be
[35:40] Jewish in your
[35:42] lineage you know natural y because
[35:45] that's what they think and that was what
[35:47] it was for them but they rejected that
[35:51] and God turned to the Gentiles right to
[35:53] bring us into the position to where we
[35:56] could be brought into the family of God
[35:58] by the new birth or adopted see then we
[36:01] must grow through the growth
[36:03] development see y coming to a place and
[36:07] see Jesus being an
[36:09] example not having to get a new birth
[36:13] right but yet he was an example pleased
[36:15] to dwell all right we get the new birth
[36:18] that makes us the children of God God
[36:20] identifies us as his children by giving
[36:24] you the new birth that's why you cry out
[36:26] by
[36:28] father all right father father coming
[36:31] out and doing it then you have to have
[36:33] the growth development that's right the
[36:35] Lord Jesus went through three years of
[36:37] growth development and then he finally
[36:40] came to a man of
[36:42] transfiguration
[36:43] experience all right amen now you
[36:46] remember that he went to a amount of
[36:47] transfiguration experience to where it
[36:49] was not just my beloved Son but then it
[36:52] became what hear ye him all right now
[36:57] that would be in the adoption and we
[37:00] must come to that right amen but see
[37:03] that's the growth development that I
[37:04] tried to explain we must come to a place
[37:07] to where that he can not only say I'm
[37:08] pleased to dwell but say hear ye him all
[37:12] right that's right coming into the
[37:16] position of the adoption right amen all
[37:20] right now we know for a certainty the
[37:23] prophet taught it we brought it out and
[37:25] tried to explain it
[37:27] that even though the disciples had the
[37:30] faith of the
[37:31] fathers but
[37:34] still having the faith of the
[37:37] fathers that did not bring the adoption
[37:40] back to the position of the
[37:42] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[37:45] of God that's right as Jesus had it to
[37:47] hear ye him right all right see that
[37:51] would have to be when the head would
[37:55] unite all right yep you remember when we
[37:57] were bringing that out see when it come
[37:59] to the place there on the Mount of
[38:01] transfiguration The Headstone was there
[38:04] which was almighty God Amen showing and
[38:07] manifesting showing full
[38:09] Authority right and from that he goes to
[38:13] the change all right now but see we come
[38:17] to the position of the The Authority
[38:20] being brought back to the church thank
[38:22] you Lord and see what what gets me about
[38:26] it is is when you speak of authority
[38:28] everybody wants to jump all the way
[38:29] Hallelujah way off out your under
[38:31] somewhere why not just take it where
[38:33] we're at
[38:36] right that has been my argument I guess
[38:39] you call it ever since I've been in this
[38:41] message why can't we realize what's God
[38:43] is doing right amen well if we had what
[38:46] we talked about having we'd have this
[38:48] we'd have that we'd have that show me in
[38:50] the Bible where that was at
[38:53] right you got count
[38:57] but what about all the other
[39:00] accounts you got times that it would say
[39:02] Peter and John you know would say I
[39:05] don't have it but in the name of Jesus
[39:07] Christ rise up and walk amen well we've
[39:09] seen people rise up and walk we've seen
[39:11] people healed we seen people delivered
[39:14] that's right when are we going to quit
[39:16] looking for something to come and look
[39:18] at what's taking place am I tried to
[39:21] explain it to you and I know when I do
[39:23] that that it's automatically going to
[39:25] drive you away from the and I I know now
[39:28] what that is and and I'll get to it
[39:30] Sunday but when you try to explain
[39:34] something people will go away from it
[39:36] because they'll have the wrong idea
[39:39] right see people think when I say look
[39:41] at what's going on that I'm not looking
[39:44] for more to come no I'm looking for
[39:46] greater and greater and greater and
[39:47] greater things to transpire all but I'm
[39:49] also looking at what has transpired amen
[39:52] that's right right amen MH and I tried
[39:56] had to explain it for all these 40 years
[39:58] here that take this group of take that
[40:01] group of people that was back there with
[40:03] the faith of the fathers bring them down
[40:05] here where we are now right and let them
[40:08] live under this environment in this
[40:10] place and these denominations they
[40:12] fought too Pharisees and Sadducees right
[40:16] and we have 969 that was just way back
[40:19] under 40 years ago or 50 and then 2,000
[40:23] or more in this message right of those
[40:25] demons and they're all loosed on
[40:28] us those 200,000,000 demons was not
[40:31] loosed on the apostles back there right
[40:34] I'm not trying to justify something I'm
[40:36] trying to tell it like it is right where
[40:39] we'll believe it that's right and have
[40:41] an opportunity to believe it Lord will
[40:43] if I can drive that down Sunday I want
[40:45] to get it hard to let let you
[40:48] see we've got to quit looking for
[40:51] something and start looking at what's
[40:52] taking
[40:54] place that's right amen
[40:57] right and by doing that then we've got
[40:59] to see what God has been doing that's
[41:02] right well look out there quit looking
[41:04] out there right
[41:08] righten M that's anointed ones those
[41:11] disciples and thing wasn't facing that
[41:13] like we are no right I'm not trying to
[41:16] justify
[41:18] nothing I can stand here and talk about
[41:21] the things I've seen and the healings
[41:22] that God has taken place so you know I'm
[41:24] not trying to just justify something
[41:26] right
[41:29] amen but you see
[41:31] Church to try to preach the truth is the
[41:34] hardest thing that is the prophet said
[41:36] cuz he said preaching a lie is easy
[41:38] people will fall for it like
[41:41] everything right but if this message is
[41:43] not preached correctly God will not come
[41:46] and honor it that's right amen all right
[41:49] see that's why I've been so jealous
[41:51] about what I've tried to
[41:52] do not comparing with brother random
[41:55] when he was saying he so zealous of the
[41:56] word that he planted but you you better
[41:58] be zealous of the word that's in your
[42:01] heart amen amen whether you be men women
[42:05] children or who you are that's right
[42:07] amen we can't flop flip flop around in
[42:10] this day all right right but you see the
[42:12] Lord Jesus came to the Mount of
[42:15] transfiguration was when the head and
[42:17] body United in him amen then he went
[42:21] forth from
[42:24] there all right
[42:27] now I've tried my best to explain to you
[42:31] for 40 something
[42:33] years that The Headstone to the Bride of
[42:37] Jesus Christ is the revealed word
[42:40] amen now I'm not talking about the
[42:43] anointing I'm not talking about the
[42:45] thing I'm talking about the headstone
[42:48] right
[42:49] amen that's right right that we'll get
[42:53] to it at the light of the message where
[42:55] that brother randam covered how that
[42:56] those two tables of stone come in that
[42:58] Temple and there was still nothing going
[43:01] on right
[43:05] amen but they had to be in there before
[43:08] anything could start taking place right
[43:10] amen right I believe the headstone to
[43:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ when that
[43:14] Prophet brought those Seven Seals right
[43:17] amen there's a headstone yes sir come
[43:21] into the church because the same he was
[43:23] the Cornerstone which is the face of the
[43:25] fathers he's The Headstone the fully
[43:27] revealed word am but you see what I'm
[43:30] talking about see we take the adoption
[43:33] and we take there was the Lord Jesus
[43:35] River Jordan and then Mount of
[43:39] transfiguration and then he brought a
[43:41] message
[43:43] right and I tried my best to explain
[43:46] that to you that's what happened to
[43:47] brother brandom y there he was received
[43:49] the new birth started God raising him up
[43:52] because he was a prophet right he could
[43:54] receive the word amen and when he walked
[43:57] in that word one day he walked right on
[43:59] into the fully revealed word the opening
[44:01] of those seals right and then he brought
[44:04] his message
[44:08] amen see we look at adoption that's
[44:11] trying to say oh one of these days we're
[44:13] going to get the Redemption of this body
[44:15] it's already
[44:17] started you receive the new birth you're
[44:19] adop your Redemption has already started
[44:22] amen that's right we just need to wait
[44:24] until it's completed
[44:26] amen see and the finish of it to where
[44:30] we can come to it see all right on
[44:33] matter of transfiguration there is The
[44:38] Headstone that came y right to prove it
[44:42] was he went right over and preached
[44:43] Matthew
[44:46] 24 y he was the word right amen right
[44:52] and the prophet say the Ten Commandments
[44:54] came those seals come down that's I
[44:56] believe it's unveiling of God
[44:59] right he covers it making the seals and
[45:01] The Headstone and the the Commandments
[45:04] the
[45:06] same but see we're looking for something
[45:08] to happen but get back into the Bible
[45:10] with it amen find out what's in the
[45:13] Bible to see what we're doing that's
[45:15] right when that head and body unites
[45:18] then there's a message to be brought
[45:20] amen not another
[45:24] message when the head you with the Lord
[45:26] Jesus is what what we call in top at a
[45:29] mount Transfiguration he didn't change
[45:31] his message right right sir amen it was
[45:35] a deeper depth of the same message amen
[45:38] right right right bringing it more into
[45:42] understanding all right right see when
[45:45] brother randam received the new birth
[45:48] and then taught up through the statue of
[45:49] perfect man and the seals open to him he
[45:52] said it become a a new book but was it a
[45:55] different book
[45:58] no why did he preach Christ the Myster
[46:00] of God revealed in after the seals broke
[46:03] right why did he preach who is this mzc
[46:05] after the seal bro he just went into a
[46:07] deeper depth and that's all we've ever
[46:10] done that's all I've ever tried to get
[46:11] you to see that's right what you see
[46:14] today is just a foundation for what's
[46:17] tomorrow but if we don't get the
[46:19] foundation right today what's tomorrow
[46:23] worth that's that's that bothers me
[46:25] because I know that's what people are
[46:27] are doing but just just get to Point see
[46:31] when that head United with that body he
[46:34] had a message to bring that's
[46:37] right when that head United with brother
[46:40] Bram out there I believe in Tucson
[46:41] Arizona you can believe what you want to
[46:43] that's up your business cuz you'll do it
[46:46] anyway but you show me where it met with
[46:48] him at show me where it Compares with
[46:50] the the prophet saying he'd meet you and
[46:52] give you something for the people right
[46:57] you show me any other place than the the
[46:59] 63 when he met that out there right all
[47:02] right but see he comes from th preaching
[47:04] a message am cuz that's what he was
[47:07] saying on Christ the Myster God revealed
[47:09] and gave to
[47:10] you page 76 what does he say 1963 728
[47:16] and the word and God is one in his
[47:18] church today making it the headship of
[47:22] the
[47:24] body and watch
[47:26] it that is redeemed to bring the
[47:31] message in the last days and be taken up
[47:34] from the dead in the resurrection to go
[47:37] back and to restore again as Adam and
[47:39] Eve in the beginning gardeny the
[47:41] three-fold mystery of
[47:43] God he said that when the head would
[47:45] Unite with the body it bring its own
[47:47] message that's exactly what transpired
[47:50] right he was standing there preaching
[47:52] the
[47:53] message right right
[47:56] showing that the head had United with
[47:58] him may not have been nobody else in the
[48:01] world with it but that don't make no
[48:03] difference that's
[48:05] right if that head can Unite with one
[48:07] person it can fulfill all the scriptures
[48:11] remember John on Pat must represented
[48:13] the entire bride as one person y right
[48:17] but see you and I then have got to come
[48:19] to the place that's right by way of the
[48:24] message let's see the the Bible becomes
[48:26] a brand new book I've heard people be in
[48:28] the message 6 months and quote that boy
[48:31] when them seals broke to me the Bible
[48:33] become a brand new
[48:38] book I'm not arguing with
[48:40] nobody I'm just selling it like it
[48:44] is don't give a novice
[48:48] to the novice is one to mess it
[48:51] up just asked a few
[48:54] questions that's all you got to do
[48:57] somebody tells you the Bible came a
[48:59] brand new book when the seal broke say
[49:00] well well is Daniel 70 weeks do you have
[49:03] an understanding to
[49:05] that what that got to do with it yeah CU
[49:08] your Prophet said y if you don't
[49:11] understand Daniel 70 weeks you cannot
[49:14] understand the
[49:15] seals I didn't say that your Prophet
[49:18] said it on the Daniel 70 week series
[49:22] amen all right see just ask if few
[49:27] questions and asking a few questions
[49:29] you'll find out where the people believe
[49:30] what they believe or not or is it just a
[49:32] quote right that's but now
[49:36] listen see then it's got to
[49:39] be that when the body of Christ all
[49:43] right we covered brother brandom he
[49:44] brought the message righten we're not
[49:46] looking for another message we're not
[49:48] looking for another Prophet to come
[49:49] somebody else to come and explain it to
[49:51] us or tell us all about it cuz brother
[49:53] random was confused no sir
[49:56] be if that's it pull your shoe off on
[49:58] the kiss your toe cuz you got to be
[50:00] almighty God that's not a
[50:03] joke because the next would have to be
[50:05] almighty
[50:07] God that's why brother random would
[50:09] bring and he didn't say the fullness of
[50:10] the godhead bodily dwell in the prophet
[50:12] he said the fullness of the godhead
[50:13] bodily would dwell in The Bride of Jesus
[50:15] Christ in the end time that's right yes
[50:17] sir go to the unveiling of God and the
[50:19] Mighty God unveil and see if I'm
[50:21] right see if the prophet said the
[50:23] fullness of the godhead bodily would
[50:25] dwell and the bride amen and see if he
[50:27] makes these statements where he said
[50:29] that the godhead is not complete without
[50:31] you amen but are you
[50:35] listening see that Prophet proved he
[50:38] came to adoption yep all
[50:40] right God proved it Vindicated it come
[50:44] down and proved it there at the
[50:46] Tabernacle and the things and proved it
[50:49] but he had a message to bring
[50:52] amen
[50:54] right well what we got to do brother
[50:56] they just bring his message that's right
[50:58] I agree with you but we got to bring it
[51:01] in the correct order right right amen if
[51:05] it's not in the correct order it's not
[51:07] his message amen that's correct that's
[51:11] why I told you many times that he used
[51:12] to let other people preach and then he
[51:14] would come out behind him and perform
[51:16] the the signs you know and the and the
[51:19] healings and he stopped doing that and
[51:21] started preaching his own message
[51:24] right m CU he he knew they wouldn't
[51:26] bring it the way he want it brought
[51:28] that's right and he knew there was a
[51:29] message to come
[51:31] right there was a message to come and he
[51:34] knew that cuz if it was a healing to
[51:37] come there had to be a message follow it
[51:39] amen that's right and see then it would
[51:42] follow that okay and it would come out
[51:45] to that position
[51:47] see all right but then what would it
[51:50] bring see when the headstone would unite
[51:52] or United with an individual the Lord
[51:55] Jesus man of transfiguration brother
[51:57] brand where you want to put it I say out
[51:59] in Arizona 63 whatever you want to do it
[52:01] you got to still admit it came and you
[52:03] got to admit it was adopted you got to
[52:04] admit it come to the place to where it
[52:06] would hear ye him you got to admit that
[52:08] because he comes over to the marriage
[52:09] and divorce and and he actually speaks
[52:11] into first
[52:12] person and says I say
[52:16] right see then in doing that see then
[52:21] that was bringing it to the bride of
[52:23] Christ and when the bride of Christ
[52:26] comes to the
[52:27] place to where that she can be adopted
[52:30] as an individual because that's the way
[52:33] God does it he adopts individuals he
[52:36] doesn't adopt a group he doesn't adopt a
[52:39] nation or a people like that he adopts
[52:43] individuals that's right all right then
[52:46] when all the individuals are
[52:49] adopted see then the body will be
[52:52] complete and The Headstone will be
[52:54] United with the body body it ain't that
[52:56] you got to have each individual get
[52:58] adopted and then come up to a place and
[53:00] then well now we're all adopted now here
[53:03] comes adoption no that's that is your
[53:06] adoption yeah right when you adopted as
[53:09] individuals into the body of
[53:13] Christ then God can do great things
[53:17] yes but then see the message would have
[53:20] to Spring out from that right that's it
[53:23] what message
[53:27] a message would spring out from The
[53:30] Headstone uniting with
[53:33] you right cuz it did from the Lord Jesus
[53:36] it did from brother brandom and if a if
[53:38] a person in this Bride is a a Capt
[53:41] individual in The
[53:43] Headstone not like I told you about the
[53:45] brother told me years ago said they I
[53:47] got the new birth I doed right there
[53:49] headstone
[53:51] everything well I didn't agree with
[53:54] him I certainly didn't agree with the
[53:56] other fell though but that's all right
[53:58] right but
[54:01] listen see you remember how we tried to
[54:04] bring it out the other
[54:06] day the Lord Jesus wants that headstone
[54:10] United with him to man of
[54:11] transfiguration
[54:15] y he went forth to
[54:19] explain the
[54:21] Redemption of the body now you remember
[54:23] that message a few weeks ago
[54:26] and how that brother
[54:28] brandham when the head United with
[54:31] him and the Bible became a brand new
[54:34] book and he began to preach the things
[54:35] after the seals broken the things like
[54:38] that that it come to a place that he was
[54:42] explaining to Wi to
[54:45] understand he had reached the third
[54:48] stage of adoption the third third stage
[54:51] of the adop adoption is not the change
[54:53] of the body right amen I've tried to
[54:56] explain that the third stage of adoption
[54:59] is to bring us to an understanding of to
[55:01] we to understand the Redemption of our
[55:04] bodies right
[55:07] amen it's not something that we come up
[55:10] to a certain place and in this no it's
[55:12] what is taking
[55:15] place so the head and body can unite to
[55:18] bring the
[55:21] message not a different message not
[55:23] something else the prophet did bring
[55:26] right come
[55:28] on no but to bring forth what he has
[55:31] brought unto us amen then I asked a
[55:34] question I said do you understand that
[55:36] you're just as perfect as God is that's
[55:39] right that's hard for the human being to
[55:42] accept isn't it yes Lord that's right
[55:44] but you know what somebody some days is
[55:45] going to understand that that's right
[55:48] amen and they're not just going to be
[55:49] talking about it it won't be a quote
[55:52] right amen it'll be a revelation amen
[55:55] that's right and when it is God can take
[55:56] it and make it come to
[55:59] passen now remember it's got to be
[56:03] revealed see so what is the third stage
[56:05] of
[56:06] adoption it's not the coming of The
[56:08] Headstone right come
[56:11] on it's the coming of the
[56:14] understanding it's the message The
[56:16] Headstone will bring to bring us to an
[56:19] understanding of to Wi to understand how
[56:23] this body is going to be redeemed
[56:26] amen all
[56:28] right see then as it brings forth what
[56:31] will it be it be like the prophet said
[56:33] on sign of the this time number two on
[56:35] you note 63 11-13 and this great life's
[56:39] great step must come into the
[56:43] Perfection that the Holy Spirit has to
[56:46] live in that church so perfectly it'll
[56:51] make the head and the body unite
[56:53] together see that that's the body he is
[56:56] the head in the
[56:59] body now listen to him read it he is the
[57:02] head in the
[57:05] body I'm not misquoting that you read it
[57:08] yourself now we find that he promised in
[57:10] this last days that that would be done
[57:13] we find
[57:14] it the last great step
[57:18] y to take
[57:21] place when the head and body unites is a
[57:24] great step to take
[57:26] place there's a message to sweep
[57:33] out now may I say it again not another
[57:37] message that's
[57:38] right when Jesus come to his position he
[57:42] had preached a lot of things but when he
[57:44] reached that position of the headstone
[57:46] he brought a message to him Amen brother
[57:48] randam had preached a lot of things but
[57:49] when he come to that headstone that
[57:51] adoption he preached his message cuz as
[57:54] we proved it showed it he said that not
[57:56] in the preparation of the years and
[57:57] things like uh the Rapture message he
[58:00] said not in the preparation but he said
[58:02] when he begins to bring his message
[58:05] brother R's message began with the seals
[58:08] opening and then he brought the message
[58:10] of redemption right
[58:13] amen so I've invited you to go and even
[58:15] read the titles after the seals broke
[58:19] Christ the mystery future home things
[58:21] that are to be who is this male chesd
[58:24] married and divorce everything goes into
[58:27] a future extent even the titles of the
[58:30] message itself shows of what he was
[58:33] bringing well when are we going to get
[58:35] into it that way right well we're just
[58:37] in the message we're in the
[58:41] message but what are we
[58:48] doing why can't we see what God has
[58:51] already done
[58:53] amen sure when the when the pyramid is
[58:58] completed and the head will Unite with
[59:00] the
[59:01] body see there will be the fully
[59:05] revealed word standing there amen that's
[59:09] right all right now as it is then the
[59:11] prophet told you what that would be what
[59:12] shall I do with Jesus called the Christ
[59:15] or what shall I do with Jesus 63
[59:18] 11:24 their big church is to be United
[59:22] the Dynamics of this church will be a
[59:25] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[59:28] have worked in a small measure while The
[59:31] Headstone is coming down to unite with
[59:34] the
[59:35] body but when the head and body unites
[59:38] together the full power of the Holy
[59:40] Ghost will raise her up just exactly
[59:43] like even the dead that's dead in Christ
[59:45] for hundreds of years will rise in the
[59:47] beauty of his Holiness and take a flight
[59:49] through disguise the Dynamics is the
[59:52] Holy Spirit righten all right amen so
[59:56] what will it be when The Headstone
[59:58] unites with the body something's going
[1:00:00] to take place amen that's
[1:00:03] right right something's going to
[1:00:05] transpire
[1:00:07] amen a refilling of the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:10] going to take
[1:00:11] place absolutely all
[1:00:14] right
[1:00:16] now to show you a little future what
[1:00:19] we're talking
[1:00:20] about you remember in First Kings 8 and6
[1:00:24] through
[1:00:25] 11 or go into 2 chonicles is really
[1:00:28] better 5 9-14 if you write them down and
[1:00:31] read them you'll find that that was
[1:00:33] where when Solomon finished the
[1:00:38] temple when Solomon finished the temple
[1:00:41] come
[1:00:45] on Solomon done all he could do that's
[1:00:49] right now I'm reading brother random if
[1:00:51] you look down on dedication you'll see
[1:00:53] it
[1:00:57] did you notice after the building was
[1:00:59] completed it was still an empty
[1:01:03] building
[1:01:04] yep there was nothing in it but
[1:01:09] Furniture
[1:01:11] right I'm reading bre around so Solomon
[1:01:15] had done all he could
[1:01:19] do now the great day of dedication come
[1:01:22] when they were going to dedicate this
[1:01:24] building for worshippers to worship
[1:01:26] something now watch worship
[1:01:29] something now without Something There To
[1:01:33] Worship the building would have been in
[1:01:38] vain are you
[1:01:40] listening but the building was now ready
[1:01:42] for
[1:01:47] dedication now it was nothing there but
[1:01:51] Furniture now they were outside if you
[1:01:54] read and they were offering sacrifices
[1:01:57] by the thousands y all kind of things
[1:02:01] was transpiring cuz they were getting
[1:02:04] ready the priest was ready washed clean
[1:02:09] yep and I'll tell you
[1:02:12] what I bet you that the cleanest fell
[1:02:14] you've ever seen that's right because if
[1:02:17] I was going to do what he done you
[1:02:19] better believe
[1:02:22] amen it would take more than chor
[1:02:25] rocks right to clean me up and you could
[1:02:29] scrub me with a scrub
[1:02:33] brush with Red Devil eye
[1:02:36] soap and I wouldn't have said a
[1:02:39] word you know why because he was fixing
[1:02:43] to go in a position that if he wouldn't
[1:02:45] clean he was
[1:02:48] dead everything was ready
[1:02:53] y everything thing was set now I know
[1:02:55] the high priest didn't go in right there
[1:02:56] so just go on you got to keep reading
[1:02:58] your scripture to get the rest of it
[1:03:00] right but now
[1:03:03] look nothing there but
[1:03:06] Furniture nothing there to
[1:03:12] worship now
[1:03:18] watch and the Levites positionally took
[1:03:21] their place went into the corner and got
[1:03:23] their H run them through the rings on
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:28] ark now this is the building of the
[1:03:32] temple not the one Moses done in the
[1:03:34] wilderness so that sacrifices and things
[1:03:36] the high priest had already done back
[1:03:38] there in case you missed what I said
[1:03:39] want ago but watch what he
[1:03:43] says run through the rings on the ark
[1:03:46] where the tables of stone was on the
[1:03:51] inside two tables of stone
[1:03:55] yep same Stone these two are one same
[1:03:59] Commandments same Covenant when these
[1:04:02] two tables are stone with the CH beims
[1:04:04] and their wings pitched across one to
[1:04:07] the other now what is that the Ten
[1:04:09] Commandment was in the Ark of the
[1:04:11] Covenant right
[1:04:13] right see now get the point when that
[1:04:15] went into the
[1:04:17] temple it was still just Furniture
[1:04:23] yep you say but you're in bad shape no
[1:04:26] I'm
[1:04:28] not because the prophet is not referring
[1:04:32] to the Shak of Glory until after they
[1:04:35] reach their
[1:04:38] position he's not talking about back
[1:04:41] there where Moses was
[1:04:44] at those two tables of stone came in
[1:04:48] that still didn't bring the shot and
[1:04:50] Glory
[1:04:52] Hallelujah we can say say we believe the
[1:04:56] message but has the message been
[1:05:02] revealed yep see Moses constructed it
[1:05:07] got everything ready down through the
[1:05:09] building of dedication they came till
[1:05:12] they brought it to its resting place
[1:05:14] where it fit down into the sockets of
[1:05:16] the great huge place that had been set
[1:05:18] for it and when it fit down and finally
[1:05:21] came to its resting place the ark
[1:05:25] the Bible said that the Lord descended
[1:05:29] down upon the
[1:05:32] place after the word was in
[1:05:36] place he didn't call it the coming of
[1:05:39] the two stones coming into the building
[1:05:41] follow the prophet till it filled the
[1:05:44] entire Temple the pillar of fire came in
[1:05:46] there with such great glory of God till
[1:05:49] the ministers could not Minister anymore
[1:05:52] because of the glory of God that's when
[1:05:54] it found its final resting place listen
[1:05:57] the Shak of Glory that followed those
[1:06:00] capping
[1:06:04] Stone
[1:06:07] right not the corner the capping Stone
[1:06:10] the main that's right all other Stones
[1:06:14] was of none effect until then yep but
[1:06:18] this main Stone came into came in The
[1:06:21] Headstone and took his place position ly
[1:06:24] for its resting place for that
[1:06:26] generation the glory of God filled the
[1:06:28] building where they were sitting and
[1:06:30] there was sh kind of Glory upon the
[1:06:32] whole building and the glory was so
[1:06:34] great till the priest couldn't even
[1:06:35] Minister because of the glory that's
[1:06:38] right you said Brother D what are you
[1:06:39] looking for right that even after the
[1:06:43] head and body
[1:06:45] unites even after the adoption of the
[1:06:48] head and the body unites and you see
[1:06:50] manifested Sons and Daughters of
[1:06:53] God yep then this your kind of Glory
[1:06:55] will be able to have something to fall
[1:06:58] on or in other
[1:07:01] words bring us the
[1:07:03] message the head and body you not and
[1:07:06] bring a
[1:07:07] message what would be that message to it
[1:07:11] right to
[1:07:14] understand the Redemption of this body
[1:07:20] amen now what are you saying brother
[1:07:22] Dale I'm saying that just because you
[1:07:25] read the book doesn't mean you got it
[1:07:28] right
[1:07:29] amen because brother brandom I'll get to
[1:07:32] that Sunday and I will not say no more
[1:07:33] about it tonight I will say it now this
[1:07:36] way when brother brandom preached those
[1:07:40] seals if God had not come down and
[1:07:43] quickened that it would have been
[1:07:45] letters on a page that's right and
[1:07:48] that's exactly what it is right now to
[1:07:50] you and I
[1:07:52] right the Bible if letters on a page

[1:08:02] this cuz I'm said I wasn't going to say
[1:08:04] nothing but it will a little bit you
[1:08:06] notice you can read a book one time and
[1:08:08] you're not getting a whole lot out of it
[1:08:10] and you go back and read the same book
[1:08:11] and you get more out of it amen amen I'm
[1:08:14] going to say it and you ain't going to
[1:08:15] like it it's not necessarily that that's
[1:08:18] been revealed to you
[1:08:21] right you may be now I didn't say that I
[1:08:23] said not necessarily right I said could
[1:08:26] be cuz you just had your understanding
[1:08:28] open
[1:08:30] right right right yeah I have to end
[1:08:34] that there because I get the message and
[1:08:37] can't see we talk about adoption in
[1:08:40] three
[1:08:43] stages we talk about everything in three
[1:08:46] stages justification s case the baptism
[1:08:50] good adoption in three stages what the
[1:08:52] new birth
[1:08:55] the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:08:56] Daughters of God the hear ye
[1:08:59] him but see then there's more to it
[1:09:02] beside to hear your him what you want to
[1:09:04] manifest his sons here
[1:09:08] father now come on when I first come in
[1:09:10] this message you know what they taught
[1:09:12] us we don't need manifested Sons here
[1:09:15] we'll have them in the Millennium though
[1:09:17] I said what in the world do we need them
[1:09:19] in the Millennium for I didn't know
[1:09:20] brother brand made that statement but
[1:09:22] one day I found he made that statement
[1:09:25] he said we need them
[1:09:27] now y that's right I said why do you
[1:09:29] need them in the Millennium we need him
[1:09:32] right now right right that's
[1:09:36] right but I'm going to make another
[1:09:39] statement brother Steven I noticed he
[1:09:41] mentioned it he said brother Dale said
[1:09:43] that everybody in the world can have the
[1:09:45] faith of the fathers or something like
[1:09:46] that you know that won't bring to
[1:09:51] Rapture I know you're going to differ
[1:09:53] from this this but go
[1:09:56] ahead all the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:58] could have the headstone United with her
[1:10:02] there's still got to be a message y
[1:10:04] right there's still got to be something
[1:10:06] to happen you're only at the stage of
[1:10:09] being able to understand that's correct
[1:10:14] amen now do you think brother Dale has
[1:10:17] died and dried
[1:10:22] up I am looking
[1:10:26] forward amen but I'm also Looking
[1:10:28] Backward to see what God has already
[1:10:33] done there's got to be a quickening
[1:10:35] power strike this church but it'll only
[1:10:38] be after the bride has the word
[1:10:41] completely sown down there's no need of
[1:10:43] bringing it until it's sown down that's
[1:10:45] why we've been here 40 years amen that's
[1:10:47] true and the sewing down of the word the
[1:10:50] planting of the
[1:10:52] word the fussing around horrible your
[1:10:55] arguments and the and the bickerings Y
[1:10:59] but it's time to go into the promised
[1:11:02] land what are you looking for brother
[1:11:05] Dale I'm looking for people to stand up
[1:11:07] and preach the
[1:11:10] gospel that God can vindicate y amen he
[1:11:14] told me that 40 something years ago he
[1:11:18] said you preach the word exactly and
[1:11:20] I'll vindicate it and back it up
[1:11:24] I thought Lord God I've been doing the
[1:11:26] best I could to preach it like it
[1:11:29] is but then one day it struck me
[1:11:35] right after that headstone unites with
[1:11:38] you is the only way you able to be able
[1:11:40] to understand the Redemption of the body
[1:11:44] right inside of that you're only talking
[1:11:47] about
[1:11:48] it you're only planting seed in the
[1:11:50] field right you're only getting your
[1:11:53] understanding
[1:11:59] opened once your understanding you said
[1:12:01] my understanding is open that means I
[1:12:03] got the new bird that's the new bir now
[1:12:05] the disciples had their understanding
[1:12:07] open before they got the new birth if
[1:12:10] they hadn't they would have know what
[1:12:12] the new birth
[1:12:15] was see I'm looking forward to
[1:12:18] something brother said there be a
[1:12:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll come
[1:12:22] down and fill fiber of our being and
[1:12:24] take us in
[1:12:26] rure but you know
[1:12:28] what it didn't come there until the
[1:12:32] tables of stone they had plenty of room
[1:12:35] in there they had a beautiful wonderful
[1:12:37] place but all of it was machry all of it
[1:12:40] was what we call mechanics in the basis
[1:12:44] of that it was Furniture sitting there
[1:12:47] right and when that art took its
[1:12:52] place it there was more
[1:12:55] furniture but inside of that Ark now
[1:12:59] watch why did it say I'm asking you a
[1:13:01] question why did it say that the prophet
[1:13:04] was bringing it out so it must have said
[1:13:06] it in in the scripture that when that
[1:13:09] Ark reached its resting
[1:13:14] place then the Shan Glory
[1:13:17] came kind of Glory didn't come when it
[1:13:19] walked in the
[1:13:20] building kind of Glory didn't come until
[1:13:22] it got right up and set it in the place
[1:13:25] right where it's supposed to
[1:13:27] be and then when that was done here come
[1:13:30] the sh amen when the word that's all
[1:13:32] I've ever tried to do I never tried to
[1:13:35] do what one thing right and try to get
[1:13:37] you to see and open your understanding
[1:13:39] to God's word amen where God could come
[1:13:42] down and speak to your heart right and
[1:13:44] Quicken it unto you amen that's right
[1:13:47] there's plenty of things left for us to
[1:13:49] do and and going on cuz we got to go on
[1:13:51] to a change of the body right that's
[1:13:53] right amen you see everybody wants to
[1:13:56] think that quick as The Headstone comes
[1:13:57] it's all over with no when The Headstone
[1:14:00] comes to the body even as a group it's
[1:14:03] just now
[1:14:04] ready
[1:14:06] right it's just ready then for the Shak
[1:14:10] kind of Glory to Quicken all you have in
[1:14:12] your
[1:14:14] feeli anybody got any
[1:14:17] questions anybody got any
[1:14:22] questions I hope I've tried to make
[1:14:24] myself clear CU that's that's almost
[1:14:27] that's 40 something years of
[1:14:31] studying to see what this Prophet has
[1:14:33] said that's
[1:14:35] right oh but brother Dale I always
[1:14:37] thought that when that should kind of
[1:14:38] Glory that's right when it comes but
[1:14:40] it's got to have something to land on
[1:14:42] right that's right
[1:14:48] amen the Bible's right when it said when
[1:14:50] the day of Pentecost will fully come
[1:14:53] right
[1:14:57] yep yep there is a place in the time for
[1:14:59] all things or two all things excuse me
[1:15:02] Ecclesiastes
[1:15:05] says there's a time to
[1:15:09] understand to understand the Redemption
[1:15:11] of these bodies adoption is not covered
[1:15:14] as the change right that's what we think
[1:15:18] it
[1:15:20] is the third stage of adoption is to be
[1:15:24] the revelation of what it will take to
[1:15:27] change us right Amen to Wi yep the
[1:15:31] understand the Redemption of the
[1:15:34] body there's plenty to
[1:15:37] come that's why it doesn't bother
[1:15:39] me 40 more years what would that make me
[1:15:42] that' be 130 110 11 years old I believe
[1:15:47] I can make
[1:15:49] it I know I still have something to
[1:15:51] preach right matter
[1:15:53] you say no so we're getting older I was
[1:15:55] listening last night we was to brother
[1:15:57] brandom as he was talking and you better
[1:15:59] listen what he says because that's right
[1:16:01] what he says but you know we're getting
[1:16:04] older losing our memories and everything
[1:16:06] else but you know what he said he said
[1:16:08] if I had a choice whether it was first
[1:16:09] 25 2 25 3D 25 or the fourth one
[1:16:14] right he said the first one now I'm
[1:16:17] quoting him he said the first one would
[1:16:18] be all right if you running after women
[1:16:21] right that's
[1:16:24] you
[1:16:26] know you know if you been huncho muncho
[1:16:29] first
[1:16:30] 25 but he said the next 25 you start
[1:16:33] doing this the next 25 he said if I had
[1:16:35] my choice I'd want to be here from 75 to
[1:16:39] 100 right you say he never lived to be
[1:16:42] that old I'll agree with you but that's
[1:16:45] what he
[1:16:46] said cuz he said I'd be more mature
[1:16:50] right right he something happens you say
[1:16:53] well now what about alimer we ain't
[1:16:54] talking about all
[1:16:58] right we ain't talking about all hamers
[1:17:01] that's the devil's doings right we're
[1:17:04] talking about what God says can happen
[1:17:08] if he can take a 110 year old man and
[1:17:11] house eight I believe it is I think he
[1:17:13] had seven sons and daughters didn't he
[1:17:15] actually but I know it at least
[1:17:18] that and he he could do a lot with you
[1:17:20] and me right you say yeah but but
[1:17:23] 100 years old you're getting so you're
[1:17:25] sleeping I may be sleeping but the one
[1:17:27] that's inside of me I like what brother
[1:17:29] R said about the old black man when he
[1:17:31] was up there you know had that old long
[1:17:32] trench coat on the little Ring Of Hair
[1:17:34] run around he said my Lord why didn't
[1:17:36] they get some of them young guys to get
[1:17:38] up there and preach why they put that
[1:17:40] old man up there he said that old man
[1:17:43] read so the others was fooling around
[1:17:45] with what was on Earth said the old man
[1:17:46] read about how that it started for the
[1:17:48] foundation of the world and said he
[1:17:49] preached a while and said he jumped up H
[1:17:51] whoe said you ain't got enough room up
[1:17:54] here for
[1:17:55] me he said Lord I want some of that
[1:17:59] that's right I want some of that amen
[1:18:03] you
[1:18:04] see maturity comes with age you may not
[1:18:07] have enough sense to be able to explain
[1:18:09] it but it's still
[1:18:12] there see we deal with only the negative
[1:18:16] the prophet was looking at the positive
[1:18:18] that's right of the maturity of the
[1:18:20] individual absolutely to where they're
[1:18:22] settled
[1:18:24] can they come and talk to you and
[1:18:25] deprogram you and get you to believe a
[1:18:27] trinity yeah now come on if they can do
[1:18:30] that you know you're lost to start with
[1:18:32] amen that's right I mean people can turn

[1:20:17] right this is the time to make known
[1:20:20] that's right I ain't caring about making
[1:20:22] known who's going to be president and
[1:20:23] what's going to take place I just want
[1:20:25] to know to it I want to understand how
[1:20:28] this body can be redeemed yeah all you
[1:20:31] got to do is just get in Jesus Christ
[1:20:33] amen we preached that 40 years ago we
[1:20:35] preached that 2,000 years
[1:20:37] ago and all you had to do is get to
[1:20:39] Christ that's
[1:20:42] true but why hasn't it
[1:20:44] brought
[1:20:46] right the P right the
[1:20:51] rapture
[1:20:54] did the prophet say the quote I gave one
[1:20:56] go so when the bride realizes who she is
[1:20:58] and what in other words paraphrasing the
[1:21:00] quote what she here for that's right
[1:21:03] amen y we're here to strip Satan of one
[1:21:08] power that he still
[1:21:11] holds amen right now you say hold no God
[1:21:15] took it away from him but you don't want
[1:21:16] him say it he still has the ability to
[1:21:19] bring man to the Grave you agree that's
[1:21:21] right right so he still holds that
[1:21:23] ability to take us to the grave but we
[1:21:26] got to strip him of that that's right
[1:21:29] and we can't strip him of that running
[1:21:31] around and little sugar tit playing
[1:21:33] around things that's right and arguing
[1:21:36] and fussing over little
[1:21:39] things right and our little petty
[1:21:45] feel we've had 40 years to get rid of
[1:21:48] them 40 something years to get rid of

[1:22:08] The Headstone can Unite with the body or
[1:22:10] the individual amen all right and that's
[1:22:13] the manifestation of the Sons and
[1:22:14] Daughters of God verse
[1:22:16] 21 18 through 21 or something 22 with
[1:22:19] the world's waiting on that why is it
[1:22:22] waiting on it it's waiting on them to

[1:22:30] are to do in the last days to bring a
[1:22:33] message

[1:22:50] straight and hard he said until the
