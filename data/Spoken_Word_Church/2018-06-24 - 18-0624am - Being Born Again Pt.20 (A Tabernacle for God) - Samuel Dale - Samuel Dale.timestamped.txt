[7:21] the house of the Lord remember now that
[7:24] the Bible study will be the first

[7:30] remember the fellowship meeting will be

[7:43] sister
[7:44] Johnny their mother passed away

[7:49] whatsoever but still they let us know
[7:51] when she passed away yesterday
[7:54] Ament remember that brother Forney will

[8:33] let us lock in you just be with each one
[8:36] remember sister Johnny and brother
[8:39] Doherty their families our Lord and the
[8:41] loss of the mother just be with that
[8:42] bless each one God and direct us in your
[8:46] love forgive our sins because we want to
[8:48] stand completing you and just have your
[8:50] way in Jesus name
[8:53] any man
[9:00] first Peter seeing you have purified
[9:04] your souls and obeying the truth through
[9:06] the spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[9:09] Brethren since you love one another with
[9:11] a pure heart fervently being born again
[9:14] not of corruptible seed but of
[9:17] incorruptible what by the Word of God
[9:20] which liveth and abideth for ever let's
[9:25] go over to Hebrews 10
[9:35] for the law having a shadow of good
[9:37] things to come and not the very image of
[9:39] the things can never with such
[9:41] sacrifices which they offered year by
[9:44] year continually make the comers darn to
[9:47] perfect now what's the point there's
[9:50] things it this can't be done it can't
[9:53] make the perfect make the person perfect
[9:56] if it's into those lines and things and
[9:58] I watch that as we tie it with the
[10:01] message as we go along for would they
[10:04] not have ceased to be offered because if
[10:07] the worshiper once purged should have no
[10:10] more conscious of sin but in those
[10:12] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[10:15] made us in every year
[10:19] or it is not possible that the blood of
[10:21] bulls and of goats should take away sins
[10:25] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[10:27] he saith sacrifice and offering thou
[10:31] wouldest not but a body thou has
[10:35] prepared and me all right now let's go
[10:39] to Scripture was using their last Sunday
[10:45] will go to first Thessalonians and the
[10:51] very God of peace sanctify you wholly
[10:53] and I pray God your whole spirit and
[10:56] soul and body be preserved blameless
[10:59] under the coming of our Lord Jesus
[11:02] Christ amen
[11:04] you may be seated the Lord at his
[11:06] blessing to the reading of the word now
[11:11] trying to continue the thought alone on
[11:14] what we were talking on last weekend and
[11:20] just to try to see if we can follow that
[11:24] point but what what I want us to see is
[11:31] you know we talked about as let's get to
[11:34] point C then we'll try to go on you know
[11:37] we have studied the message we have come
[11:40] to the basis of finding a lot of truth
[11:43] in the Word of God all right now one of
[11:47] those truths is that we found that a
[11:51] Christian now a Christian is the only
[11:56] one that can sin sinners condemned on a
[11:59] higher level
[12:01] but a Christian is the only one that can
[12:03] see in now we got to find out how that
[12:05] and we went to that how that that
[12:08] Christian cannot sin from his inner
[12:11] being of the soul
[12:14] all right no you understand that he
[12:16] can't sin from dark because that's where
[12:18] Christ build all right but he sins in
[12:21] his body his spirit all right his body
[12:24] is worth nothing
[12:26] you know no anything at all without that
[12:29] spirit to make it work
[12:31] all right so the problem
[12:32] is in the spirit realm of mankind that
[12:36] we see those were our trouble is the
[12:39] memory reason conscience affections and
[12:42] things DARS were we have our trouble all
[12:46] right
[12:46] see then that way we're not born again
[12:49] you remember Sunday we're not born again
[12:52] in our body you're not born again in
[12:56] your spirit you're born again in your
[12:59] soul which is the center part of you the
[13:02] N word being ours were we're born again
[13:06] at all right now and we found those
[13:09] things to be marvelous for understanding
[13:12] purposes because it's always been a
[13:15] thing you know we'll do we see in order
[13:17] can we see in our are we as Christians
[13:20] do we do this or what do we do and if we
[13:23] see in where do we sin from you know
[13:25] like that well then those things should
[13:28] be settled by now as we've studied the
[13:30] message of the Prophet bringing out the
[13:33] points and seeing you know that a
[13:36] Christian a born-again Christian does
[13:40] have problems and troubles alright but
[13:44] not in that soul because the soul is
[13:47] born again alright it's pure it's holy
[13:51] Satan can't get into where you're at
[13:54] because you're sealed in sin he's sealed
[13:58] out alright now to hold that then we see
[14:01] that we do wrong in our spirit realm and
[14:05] our body really all like body does is
[14:07] displays it's worth nothing because you
[14:11] tap him in the head knock him out and
[14:13] he's done you know there's nothing that
[14:16] can be done like that it you don't
[14:19] reason and all that you do all of that
[14:21] through your spirit realm you know
[14:24] because your new body you just out see
[14:26] taste feel smell in here all right now
[14:29] so remember that now and and that would
[14:32] be very needful and helpful to
[14:36] understand the Christian journey and
[14:39] that way we don't go wrong all right now
[14:44] but I've tried to hoot to a little bit
[14:47] darkness past Sunday to try to make a
[14:50] point about the you know who we are that
[14:55] we're a triune being alright now one
[15:00] part of us gone we're not worth anything
[15:02] right
[15:03] it takes the tribe to try on the body
[15:06] the spirit the soul to make us a being a
[15:09] person an individual take one of those
[15:12] away
[15:12] you're not complete things won't work
[15:16] you know take it any any part of those
[15:19] three away
[15:20] so just remember then now remember that
[15:25] in no way would we ever try to go in the
[15:33] wrong room and just say well you know it
[15:38] don't matter what I do it's not me
[15:42] that's doing it
[15:43] it's a citizen my spirit well now it be
[15:48] careful with that because that can be
[15:51] true you know that that's right it can
[15:53] be true all right but what if we don't
[15:57] have that inward being in the right way
[16:01] what if it's not born again what if it's
[16:05] not pure then we've got problems right
[16:09] that was the whole point of trying to
[16:12] get you to see from Sunday you know that
[16:15] the that we're a triune being and being
[16:19] that triune being then it takes those
[16:22] three to make us work alright one
[16:27] without the other
[16:27] it won't work this will evolve any one
[16:30] of the three you have no way for it to
[16:32] work yeah alright see the cold it's got
[16:35] to be in that room so then let's don't
[16:38] try to justify and say well well it's
[16:42] really I'm glad we found out that a
[16:46] Christian sins from the spirit and I'm
[16:49] glad we found that out because that
[16:50] that's just that spirit doing it it's
[16:52] not me
[16:56] you might ought to remember this fear it
[17:01] is you right all right it's just the
[17:08] basis that we order come to a point of
[17:10] realization and the truth of it is what
[17:13] that that soul cannot sin because his
[17:17] seed remaineth in us according to the
[17:20] scripture and that soul cannot sin all
[17:23] right but the body the spirit realm can
[17:26] do wrong so then we don't just well it's
[17:29] not me it's my body in my spirit that's
[17:34] going wrong see when you start doing
[17:36] like that's your propping up things
[17:38] right you're making excuses for what
[17:42] you're doing you're trying to justify
[17:44] your point instead of being truthful all
[17:48] right just keep in mind that what I'm
[17:50] trying to say then because we're one
[17:52] being we're being we're one being body
[17:57] spirit and soul all right now all of
[18:00] that and that takes that to make me so
[18:03] then if I can't just go along say well
[18:06] that's not really me because that's my
[18:08] spirit and that's my body come on that's
[18:16] the body you've lived in all your life
[18:17] and that's the spirit that has come into
[18:20] that that's made us into the rim of to
[18:25] be able to you know memory reason
[18:28] conscious affections and times all right
[18:31] that was why I was ending up the
[18:33] services Sunday we'll get back a little
[18:36] more later to it but ending it up
[18:38] talking about the fact that those
[18:42] virtues work out through your spirit
[18:46] right the nature of God is with inside
[18:52] in the soul sealed in all right but then
[18:56] working back out through that spirit
[18:59] realm is supposed to come in to being
[19:02] God's nature working in our spirit realm
[19:08] all right so then the the virtues would
[19:11] work out through the spirit is not to
[19:14] just say no this it's not to say that
[19:16] the virtues are the spirit no no I don't
[19:18] see you you go wrong to say the virtues
[19:21] of the spirit now
[19:22] the virtues work through the spirit that
[19:26] spirit room is in us and no matter what
[19:28] you do you can't operate without the
[19:31] spirit realm and naturally you won't
[19:35] operate without the body so then don't
[19:38] get it to where that we can say well
[19:40] well okay then then it's really not me
[19:43] okay listen see where we're trying to
[19:45] justify something to make it work for
[19:48] our own our own way of thinking instead
[19:51] of saying my whole being thing if you
[19:57] see me go out and rob a bank
[19:59] well that wasn't my soul well where was
[20:04] that i right it was that robbing the
[20:11] bank right see that's why we try to take
[20:16] things and even though though we find
[20:19] truth will overrun the truth and try to
[20:23] make it work on out into other realms
[20:26] instead of being truthful about it my
[20:31] spirit is what's giving me trouble but
[20:33] you know what that's not your spirit
[20:36] giving me trouble
[20:38] right that's not your spirit giving me
[20:43] trouble it's my spirit that gives me
[20:46] trouble
[20:46] it's my spirit that has to be brought
[20:49] under control because come on what is
[20:52] there supposed to be it's supposed to be
[20:53] the soul controlling the spirit the
[20:57] spirit controlling the body right
[20:59] because the soul is the center rim the
[21:03] part of us that guides us and keeps us
[21:06] that is if you're born again that is
[21:09] Christ coming and living in you bring in
[21:13] his nature his everything within you to
[21:17] try to let it then work back out well I
[21:22] just can't happen it I just can't help
[21:24] it you know I I know I've got a little
[21:27] temper here and I just can't help it now
[21:29] what are you doing you're trying to
[21:32] justify something instead of facing up
[21:35] front just get it right that's where
[21:37] we'll get into the virtues when the
[21:39] Prophet when he gets in not to worry
[21:41] says that you know virtue and what it is
[21:44] and then temperance and what it is you
[21:49] know we'll didn't see we'll go on the
[21:50] other side of it a lot of time and we'll
[21:52] say Oh what but you know I'm a Christian
[21:57] and and I don't have no wrong calls you
[22:02] might not have no wrong thoughts but you
[22:03] just lied is that plain enough I didn't
[22:08] break it down and smile that's as plain
[22:11] as it can be you just lied C to say you
[22:15] never have any wrong thoughts as you
[22:17] lied about it
[22:18] uh-huh see that way you're not facing it
[22:22] honestly to say that we are a human
[22:24] being and brother branham will come up
[22:26] here to temperance and he'll say this
[22:29] controlling that temper well I didn't
[22:33] thank you Chris you had a temper
[22:36] no I think we need to get everything in
[22:41] the right order all right but now we are
[22:44] a triune being okay body spirit and soul
[22:49] then we know that the message in Prior
[22:52] we've been through it that you tank can
[22:56] take and the but random will cover in
[22:58] his early ministry body soul spirit then
[23:04] when he comes into the last part of his
[23:06] ministry especially back into the 65
[23:09] he'll come to body spirit and soul
[23:13] because that way the Bible lines up he
[23:16] got it lined up because the Bible says
[23:19] the soul that sinneth it shall die it
[23:22] doesn't say the spirit that's in it
[23:24] because that spirits going to do wrong
[23:27] they don't mean you got to but I just
[23:31] can't help it well maybe we need to do a
[23:34] lot of praying that might change a lot
[23:37] of things if we do a lot of praying
[23:39] to try to get over that all right now
[23:41] see that was what I was trying to bring
[23:43] out and bring out the point of what see
[23:47] then the soul is the center part of man
[23:52] all right
[23:53] then that comes out wordly to control
[23:58] the spirit realm
[24:00] the spirit automatically controls the
[24:03] body
[24:03] alright see that way we've got it in
[24:06] order to her that we can follow the
[24:10] Christian life and see what's going on
[24:14] but never forget and I wanted to put
[24:18] this point in to make sure we don't
[24:19] never forget that your body and spirit
[24:24] is a part of your being you don't don't
[24:29] try to isolate it well my soul that's
[24:31] what my real mean well now come on you
[24:36] say well one of these days we don't get
[24:38] rid of this old body that's why they
[24:40] taught it in the organizations and the
[24:42] people of this message teach it that you
[24:44] don't get a new body you know a lot of
[24:48] people in this message after all that
[24:49] brought around them instead of I still
[24:51] believe you're gonna get a new body
[24:53] another body
[24:54] I want this body made new right because
[24:59] this is the body I've lived in okay this
[25:03] is my being this is Who I am but I want
[25:06] God to work from the inside out through
[25:09] that alright now as you'll see then the
[25:12] statue of a perfect man that's where it
[25:14] comes in so valuable because that it
[25:17] does work now listen it works back out
[25:21] from the inward part into our spirit
[25:24] realm and we've got to bring that under
[25:29] control well I just can't help it well
[25:33] then you're not trying at least we could
[25:35] try right you know we could do something
[25:39] that away alright because see we are not
[25:41] a complete unit unless we're body spirit
[25:46] and soul take off any part you're not a
[25:49] complete unit alright you won't work so
[25:53] then we we know then that the soul is
[25:56] the part that's born again the soul then
[26:00] controls the spirit the spirit controls
[26:04] the body that brings the whole unit into
[26:08] being to manifest Christianity
[26:13] in our journey in life all right
[26:18] the because we're not born again their
[26:20] body we're not going to get in their
[26:22] spirit but they do play a part see
[26:28] without your body spirit it wouldn't
[26:30] work
[26:31] God has to contact us through the body
[26:39] here right see taste feel smell in here
[26:42] all right he doesn't just open us up and
[26:46] go pour stuff in you don't know he has
[26:49] to work through the rim and what's so
[26:51] amazing I don't understand how he does
[26:53] it but I don't understand how Satan does
[26:56] it either I can understand him do any
[26:57] better than I can understand God doing
[26:59] it because God won't dwell in an unclean
[27:02] vessel and I know these vessels are
[27:03] unclean but yet he will take that and
[27:08] work through it and use it to bring us
[27:11] to the right place
[27:12] all right because we're coming to the
[27:15] Christian journey okay making the part
[27:20] that we see what's controlling us that
[27:23] it's Christ in you the hope of glory is
[27:29] him controlling us
[27:31] but knowing and for surety and realizing
[27:35] that we're human beings and human beings
[27:39] in this body as long as we're in this
[27:41] body we will how trouble none see you
[27:47] take the profit and then you'll try to
[27:49] justify this try to justify that the
[27:51] prophet said as long as we're in this
[27:53] body will be a sticker okay now well I
[27:58] just can't have it I'm just gonna be a
[28:01] sticker God wants me to be a sticker I
[28:04] won't be a good sticker yeah that's kind
[28:08] of stupidity in it that's the best way
[28:12] to say it
[28:12] let's see we try to justify things
[28:17] to try to make it work it won't work
[28:20] repentance is the best time the best way
[28:24] to get rid of anything is repent of it I
[28:26] think you try to justify it or hide it
[28:28] or or cover it or you know it's just
[28:31] this repent alright because you've got
[28:37] to be a complete unit before God can use
[28:43] you already following enough because
[28:49] he's a complete unit the God's a
[28:54] complete unit God is body spirit and
[28:57] soul just like your body spirit and soul
[29:00] so then he can work through those realms
[29:03] and as I said a moment ago how does he
[29:05] get through when one time I'm having
[29:08] wrong thoughts and the second time that
[29:11] this right from that all at once God
[29:13] comes through that and brings some of
[29:15] the most beautiful thoughts into your
[29:18] mind you ever done that
[29:22] no come on have you ever done it I mean
[29:24] you're actually having wrong thoughts
[29:26] something going wrong problems and
[29:29] troubles you know I don't mean getting
[29:31] out and running like crazy I'm just
[29:32] saying human human being well God comes
[29:37] right through that and speaks to us
[29:42] right that's marvelous so then where
[29:48] would you be without a body that he
[29:51] could use to speak through where would
[29:54] you be without a spirit for him to be
[29:56] able to come down and as the Bible says
[29:58] come let us reason together
[30:04] God sits down in their spirit sometimes
[30:07] in research with us right I mean that
[30:12] might not be too good of language but
[30:14] it's his truth he does deal with us
[30:16] through our spirit realm see because he
[30:22] is body spirit and soul that's what God
[30:29] is a real person okay now we know to
[30:35] bring the Godhead into complete order
[30:37] and making it right the great eternal
[30:42] God existed before the world had desires
[30:46] and all of that and then he came down to
[30:48] earth and when he did that soul is the
[30:52] very soul of Almighty God all right
[30:56] talking about Jesus Christ as he came
[30:58] into birth the very soul is a very soul
[31:01] of Almighty God his spirit was the very
[31:04] spirit of Almighty God and his body was
[31:08] created that's why we read in Hebrews 10
[31:11] 5 was that a body that has prepared me
[31:17] now see he he made a body to come and
[31:21] live in it now there is a fulfillment of
[31:25] his desires
[31:29] right he made a body and come to live in
[31:33] it now think about it or what we're
[31:36] trying to get to God has always wanted a
[31:45] tabernacle a dwelling place all right
[31:51] so Moses is taken up to heaven sees
[31:57] things comes back to earth and we'll
[32:01] read it in a second
[32:02] and he builds on earth through skins and
[32:11] in tents or whatever you wanna call it
[32:13] you know and stuff like that he builds
[32:16] our brains into being what he saw in
[32:20] heaven which was a dwelling place of God
[32:26] through God dwelt in the tent back there
[32:29] that was made that was a dwelling place
[32:32] so he started off his earthly journey
[32:35] not as a body spirit and soul man he
[32:38] started his journey in life as to a
[32:42] tabernacle that he could come and dwell
[32:45] in and Moses built that tabernacle they
[32:52] started off with a tent right unless
[32:58] that's the best way you can do it he
[32:59] started off with skins and he was making
[33:03] it but remember then what we're talking
[33:06] about what God wanted Moses built but
[33:15] that was that's complete that just
[33:19] started his existence upon earth or
[33:21] whatever you want to call it to
[33:23] fellowship with mankind
[33:26] and he started it with a tent in the
[33:29] journey so let's go ahead and get
[33:30] started and we'll read some scriptures
[33:32] and go ahead with number one we bypassed
[33:35] 1a because 1a is the rapture we read
[33:39] around is explaining how the inward
[33:41] being as the sole this second rim is the
[33:43] spirit the outside is the body all right
[33:47] now look what he says now this is the
[33:50] scriptures taken from acts 7 this is
[33:54] actually part of what was used as a
[33:56] statue of a perfect man all right
[33:58] look our fathers had a tabernacle of
[34:01] witness in the wilderness as he had
[34:04] appointed speaking under Moses that he
[34:07] should make it according to the fashion
[34:08] he had seen now I like to think like
[34:13] this what did Moses see
[34:21] did Moses did God take Moses up and he
[34:25] saw tent you know
[34:31] skins our thing now he saw the
[34:36] tabernacle of Almighty God okay he saw
[34:45] the body before it came into being now
[34:50] listen to what I'm saying did he just
[34:54] see a tent and see this that did he come
[34:56] back and built out all right that's fine
[35:00] David comes over and look what all he
[35:04] does in Solomon and builds a wonderful
[35:07] tabernacle way more marvelous in
[35:13] appearance than the tent that Moses had
[35:19] but yet God was pleased to dwell in that
[35:23] tent then they brought it to earth but
[35:27] understand what I'm saying see look
[35:29] according to the fashion he had seen we
[35:33] see I don't think like I know I'm crazy
[35:35] I don't think like everybody else I'm
[35:37] crazy but I love it sometimes you know
[35:41] what because see I love to think about
[35:44] not that Moses is up in heaven and he's
[35:46] seeing it tent
[35:49] and he said y'all go back down and I'll
[35:51] build this and I'll put this and I'll
[35:53] put that he's a prophet he doesn't need
[35:58] that all he needs is to see what God
[36:02] won't God won't somebody God won't back
[36:08] down a dwelling place right because
[36:11] remember he so he spirit Almighty God
[36:15] but he has no earthly form of dwelling
[36:19] place you'd be in a theophany he'd be in
[36:25] the forms like that different things but
[36:27] not in a being I mean not in a tell and
[36:32] he's not in a being flesh at that time
[36:36] so then Moses he builds it according to
[36:40] what he's seen that's why it's wonderful
[36:45] to me you know I I kind of heard
[36:49] something the other day brother was
[36:50] telling me about that this passenger
[36:53] said he didn't want his wife to know
[36:54] anything about the message or something
[36:56] no as much I guess that he did but I'm
[37:01] kinda little bit different from that I
[37:03] want my wife to know the what God is to
[37:07] her I believe that's what it's supposed
[37:10] to be I believe it's Christ to her as
[37:14] well it is to me you know all right now
[37:17] not throw stones are just making the
[37:20] point that the I want you to have your
[37:23] understanding of what you see and see
[37:27] that way you'll see more like Moses sees
[37:30] things you'll be taken up to see a
[37:33] marvelous beautiful things but it was
[37:38] Jesus Christ and sisters see you say
[37:42] well we don't have nothing to do you
[37:44] know how I've always said it and I
[37:46] believe it so you could sit down with
[37:48] some of those old customers Jews and
[37:50] talk to them
[37:51] your sisters could
[37:53] and explaining that say well what's this
[37:56] what's that you remember brother branham
[37:58] talking about that rabbi those two lows
[38:01] and he said I never seen that that was
[38:05] what he's supposed to been studying he
[38:06] said he'd never seen it
[38:08] see I believe in something real I don't
[38:11] disbelieve in imaginary things and it
[38:13] and he's Moses went up and he saw this
[38:16] great big tent and he come back and
[38:17] build it on earth that's all right you
[38:20] want to think that way I think he went
[38:22] up so Jesus Christ he saw Almighty God
[38:28] he come to earth and tried to build a
[38:29] tabernacle God watch it as we go along
[38:34] so he tried to be already seen which
[38:36] also our fathers that came forth came
[38:39] after brought in with Jesus into the
[38:43] possession of the Gentiles whom God
[38:45] drove out before the face of our fathers
[38:47] unto the days of David who found favor
[38:50] before God and desired to find a
[38:53] tabernacle for the God of Jacob the you
[39:00] can look at David more than you'll see
[39:02] it in Moses but David longed to build
[39:06] God a dwelling place he didn't get to
[39:13] cause it too much sin that's like but he
[39:16] desired that and he sure didn't do a lot
[39:19] cuz he got everything ready for Solomon
[39:21] didn't it don't leave David out of it he
[39:24] got everything ready Solomon I don't
[39:25] that dude just put it together
[39:26] he just assembled it David had
[39:30] everything but going cuz he loved it who
[39:33] found favor for guarding desired to
[39:34] build a tabernacle for the God of Jacob
[39:39] always been something that man wants to
[39:41] build a place for God if we get over
[39:44] there far enough remember on the Mount
[39:46] of Transfiguration Peter named said let
[39:49] us build three Tabernacles even though
[39:52] they had come through all of that and
[39:53] seen all that they still was trying to
[39:56] build Tabernacles with Solomon building
[40:01] my house now
[40:03] howbeit the most high dwelleth not in
[40:05] temples made with hands let's say if the
[40:09] Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is
[40:12] my footstool
[40:13] what house will you build me saith the
[40:17] Lord or what is the place of my rest
[40:23] then listen to it
[40:27] howbeit the most I dwell if not in
[40:29] temples made with hands let's say if the
[40:32] Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is
[40:36] my footstool what house will you build
[40:39] me there was what can you build that
[40:46] would be to my satisfaction of what I
[40:49] want is if the Lord or what is the place
[40:55] of my rest a house of tabernacle of
[41:00] light is for you to go sit down rest
[41:02] cool off you know no build it
[41:06] look our statement that God made and
[41:11] remember this is God talking huh
[41:12] heavens my throne earth my foots too
[41:14] well will you build meself the Lord or
[41:17] what is the place of my rest hath not my
[41:19] hand made all these things Solomon built
[41:27] a beautiful masterpiece of a tabernacle
[41:33] and all of those things but you know if
[41:38] you read that correctly you'll see one
[41:40] come up he had to take what was on earth
[41:43] to make that out of if God wanted to
[41:47] build his house he could have made the
[41:49] whole thing out of pure gold right
[41:54] that's what he's saying he said in other
[41:58] words you you want to build me a house
[42:00] but what house can you build me I can
[42:02] build my own house I can make it to work
[42:07] that I'd have everything perfect
[42:09] what said I'm not gonna do it
[42:12] and we'll let you hit and we'll let you
[42:17] be part of it right so then we know that
[42:22] what he started Moses he saw the what he
[42:30] saw and come back and build it he built
[42:32] it out of skin
[42:34] he made it to look like skins and things
[42:37] trying to build what he thought the
[42:41] tabernacle of God looked like see that's
[42:46] why I love to listen to the Prophet and
[42:49] it is amazing to me to think you don't
[42:53] ever think what do you know right around
[42:55] him he'll be just coming along and let's
[42:59] see he was thinking yesterday was honest
[43:00] on something that sister explained it
[43:04] but he would try to brother round him
[43:10] which would come to her to a place that
[43:13] he has no answer to the question right
[43:18] but he says we're going to get into
[43:22] these things to the trumpets you
[43:26] remember he was planning on doing it
[43:29] well see he didn't even know what they
[43:31] were other than when he was reading
[43:36] we get a profit once he started reading
[43:40] that
[43:41] if you're listening when that profit
[43:44] when I read it I'll read this out of the
[43:47] other
[43:47] I read Moses do this make a curtains
[43:52] around this way make it out of this skin
[43:55] and make this out of that skin and make
[43:57] this to come over like that and like
[43:59] this to do that
[44:00] you know that's the best I can read what
[44:04] a prophet sees what everything in there
[44:07] means and that it ever be pointed to
[44:12] Jesus Christ
[44:15] badger skin all the things everything
[44:20] dar spoke of Jesus Christ that's what
[44:24] Moses saw in heaven was Jesus Christ
[44:27] come to earth and try to describe him
[44:30] well once he left the rims of the
[44:32] Eternity and come to earth he come back
[44:35] to mortal and coming back to mortal then
[44:38] he could only describe what he saw in
[44:40] mortal language he saw a tent he saw
[44:45] this he saw yet he saw an opening he saw
[44:48] a thing he saw you know the the
[44:52] candlesticks he saw all of the things
[44:54] and begin to try to describe but every
[44:56] bit of that is describing Jesus Christ
[45:01] everything in nurse describing Jesus
[45:04] Christ now if you look at it and follow
[45:06] him Tomba then you'll see that David you
[45:09] know pulled up Solomon comes in and
[45:12] Solomon is just trying to do the same
[45:14] things he's trying to put in stone just
[45:19] like Enoch
[45:22] enoch built the pyramid right in stone
[45:26] but what was he building
[45:30] he was building Jesus Christ in stone
[45:37] because he was a prophet see a prophet
[45:43] knows what - how to build things we said
[45:47] well they hate him make sure you put
[45:49] this here make sure all right and Moses
[45:52] ever studied a little bit in the lineup
[45:56] of Moses Moses could go in and out of
[46:00] the temple the top of
[46:08] everybody else better stay out Moses
[46:12] could move in and out Joshua could even
[46:14] move into a certain room because he was
[46:17] chosen for that part but he couldn't go
[46:19] on with Moses he'd have to come throw
[46:22] far steady your Bible
[46:23] no wonder Joshua knew all about all the
[46:27] things Joshua's chosen of Moses once he
[46:29] he come back with right report he was
[46:33] chosen of Moses to be right with him and
[46:35] the Bible says Joshua stayed in the
[46:38] temple but in other words the tabernacle
[46:40] he was in the building he might not have
[46:42] been behind a holy of Holy's ain't
[46:44] saying that I'm just saying he was right
[46:46] in there he would know everything
[46:48] because he was chosen to be there right
[46:52] that's the way I love to do the word but
[46:55] look God said I could have built what I
[46:58] wanted I can make me a house I can do
[47:04] this what said I wants you to do it told
[47:11] Moses build it for his time Solomon
[47:15] built it for his time enoch built it for
[47:18] his time
[47:19] each one of them marvelous and stone
[47:21] would build Jesus Christ in stone they
[47:27] took it see Almighty God you go into
[47:30] pyramids well you got justification same
[47:32] case baptism when I go you've got the
[47:35] seven steps going into the inverted seal
[47:37] into going up you got you got all kind
[47:40] of things that's in the Bible well are
[47:43] you following me
[47:44] see Church what I'm trying to get you to
[47:46] see is one time he said if I wanted to
[47:52] build a house I would build it out of
[47:54] what I wanted to build it out of I said
[47:57] but that's not what I'm wanting but said
[47:59] you're doing the best you can do
[48:03] do what you're doing David
[48:07] you can't do it but get everything ready
[48:12] Solomon is gonna build me a house and he
[48:17] did but you know each one of those
[48:20] things the pyramid is the only one
[48:26] that's left in time right the pyramid is
[48:32] the only one that's left in time Moses
[48:37] all of that skins all of that scone
[48:42] Solomon build a temple marvelous and
[48:47] wonderful as it is it's gone because you
[48:53] know what that was only God's dwelling
[48:56] place for a time sure he's happy to
[49:02] dwell there but he was looking forward
[49:06] to something else
[49:08] looking forward until it would come to
[49:11] work that it would be more wonderful
[49:15] right all right now so we get through
[49:20] and seeing that it's coming down but
[49:25] watch one gamma then all at once
[49:29] after all of these things are built and
[49:32] are torn down and the best you can do is
[49:37] what is it hey guy I've got it in to
[49:39] thank you guys talking about the
[49:41] building of the temple remodeling and
[49:44] bringing it back the house of God
[49:48] and he said to the latter house is
[49:50] greater than the former I wonder why you
[49:54] sit down when how could he have made
[49:57] anything greater than Solomon you
[50:02] understand what I'm getting at when they
[50:05] were rebuilding some of that walls they
[50:07] just took old rough stuff and picked it
[50:09] up and stuck it in made walls it ain't
[50:11] not the beauty that it was in the days
[50:13] of Solomon the days of Solomon
[50:18] everything was hewn cut made to fit
[50:20] don't go there look when they started
[50:24] back when hey guiding them started they
[50:26] were just they didn't saw the Timbers
[50:28] but I mean the the rocks and I thought
[50:30] they just picked up what they could put
[50:32] and made a temple but the Bible says the
[50:38] latter house was greater than the former
[50:43] you know why because restoration the
[50:50] faith of the fathers is a wonderful
[50:51] thing and was a great thing for the time
[50:53] I hope you following me the restoration
[50:56] to bring back the faith of the father's
[50:58] will bring it into a greater meaning and
[51:00] greater depth of understanding than in
[51:04] the original house that Paul and him had
[51:07] because in this one it went on from the
[51:11] faith of the father's all the way to the
[51:13] bringing of the headstone the prophets
[51:15] message
[51:17] right God keeps unfolding what he wanted
[51:21] to do but you know what he come over so
[51:25] far and he stopped he said okay now
[51:28] that's it
[51:29] since now I'm stepping on the scene and
[51:31] I'm gonna build my own body I'm gonna
[51:35] build my own tabernacle you've done
[51:39] wonderful you've done your part you put
[51:41] it in stone but said now I'm gonna build
[51:44] my own Hebrews 10 5 a body God didn't
[51:51] want to build it up 10 that was for time
[51:56] he just used it for a time knowing it
[51:59] would be destroyed
[52:00] a great big monstrosity of a temple
[52:03] until he would even say if you're any
[52:07] were just looked at the temple and out
[52:10] here he honored daddy glory into that
[52:13] but one day as toward huh you know what
[52:20] the second house come up you know what
[52:23] the day come it was tore down because
[52:27] it's not - not what God wanted is not
[52:29] what he wanted to be complete
[52:33] now are you listening that's why you see
[52:36] it if you listen we started out talking
[52:40] about what we're trying being we're a
[52:44] body with spirit
[52:46] we're soul a try on being God is a try
[52:51] on being the soul is Almighty God the
[52:57] spirit with Almighty God the body was
[53:01] created for him to step into to the
[53:05] place that he would now listen to I'm
[53:11] saying all those other temples were
[53:14] destroyed but don't you think that
[53:18] temple was destroyed because they beat
[53:20] it and cut it and split it and down with
[53:22] it it stepped right into eternity so
[53:29] don't take that one and try to do away
[53:30] with it now because you come to the
[53:32] right place
[53:33] all right because you come into the
[53:35] scriptures see you get into Matthew when
[53:39] he comes to the River Jordan dark God
[53:43] had come into being because of little
[53:45] virgin had give birth to a man and
[53:49] brought him into being that sold in that
[53:51] spirit was Almighty God that body had a
[53:53] beginning
[53:56] it was not eternal because showing what
[54:00] he was going to be alright and see then
[54:03] he comes forth to his time to beginning
[54:06] his ministry on the River Jordan that
[54:09] comes forth and what does it say this is
[54:12] my beloved son whom I'm pleased to dwell
[54:15] in other words this is my body now this
[54:20] is my tabernacle
[54:21] I built it you build all them others you
[54:26] handled all that you've done wonderful
[54:28] because it's all as dire for speaking of
[54:31] what I was to bring forth but now I'm
[54:33] stepping forth myself Almighty guard
[54:37] stepping into human flesh
[54:42] don't try to do away with his crown
[54:44] being so don't try to do away with your
[54:47] crown be keep it your body spirit and so
[54:51] you got a right to do all of those
[54:53] thoughts but see now watch what I'm
[54:57] getting at cause it's gonna go into the
[54:59] statute of perfect Lana cuz that's what
[55:00] i'ma doing with it
[55:01] but he says on the river Jordan this is
[55:03] my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to
[55:06] dwell right then he spends three and a
[55:12] half years tutoring training child
[55:16] training that human element wooden
[55:22] trying to train the soul or the spirit
[55:23] he's training that human element that
[55:26] body the human element that would fit
[55:30] the rest of him the body of the soul in
[55:32] the spirit is pure and perfect they
[55:34] don't need nothing the body didn't need
[55:37] nothing because of it being sin it
[55:38] needed something because it was a
[55:40] beginning it had a beginning but now
[55:43] he's building it then what's wrong talk
[55:46] about a body thou hast prepared me the
[55:50] rent said the father provided that body
[55:52] through the Virgin Mary one that he
[55:55] could step into himself God stepped into
[55:59] that body at the birth
[56:02] right and lived in that body brought him
[56:10] up through life gave him a tutor and
[56:14] brought him all the way the Holy Spirit
[56:16] I only do what my father tells me than
[56:20] what he said comes up through life
[56:24] and he comes out to a place where he
[56:28] says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[56:30] pleased to dwell but that wouldn't have
[56:32] finished with a story that wasn't the
[56:37] finishing of it that wasn't a completion
[56:41] of that body even though brother Ron
[56:47] said right there the body was redeemed
[56:52] on the River Jordan
[56:55] but then he still had three and a half
[56:57] years of ministry and then he comes over
[57:01] into Matthew 17 this is my beloved Son
[57:06] in whom I'm pleased to dwell listen here
[57:10] you him now quote brother branham he
[57:15] said God simply was saying if you get
[57:18] anything else from now on now I'm
[57:22] paraphrasing it but it's pretty close if
[57:24] you get anything else from now on you're
[57:27] going to get it from him
[57:32] see they didn't want to try to find the
[57:34] fathers anymore
[57:36] there was the father they wouldn't try
[57:40] to find God anymore there was God sure
[57:46] that body was beaten torn but he wasn't
[57:49] destroyed because just in a few days you
[57:55] find him raised in glorified condition
[58:00] when was just a short period of time the
[58:03] Prophet said he said he went right off
[58:06] of Mount of Transfiguration straight to
[58:09] Calvary and someday I'll tell you what
[58:12] God showed me on that but it's there
[58:16] it's not going to be a great time that
[58:21] we're looking for
[58:25] remember we look out there we look back
[58:30] there instead of looking and seeing
[58:33] what's taking place but a run said to be
[58:36] a short period of time he said he left
[58:39] Mount of Transfiguration and went
[58:42] straight to Calvary a very short period
[58:49] this is my beloved son hear ye him God
[58:55] created the body according to
[58:58] perseverance 62 it was a different body
[59:02] yet it was a human body
[59:06] you know Solomon build him a house are
[59:11] you ready
[59:12] you know Solomon build him a house but
[59:19] Stephen said I'll be at the most out
[59:25] dwelleth not in outer then what a body
[59:28] that has prepared me God prepared
[59:31] himself a body in the form of the Lord
[59:34] Jesus which was the Christ meaning the
[59:37] Anointed One and now all that God was in
[59:40] Christ he was the fullness of the
[59:42] Godhead bodily
[59:43] that's what the scripture says all that
[59:46] God was he poured into Christ he was
[59:47] Emmanuel now what's the rest of that
[59:50] quote and all Christ he poured into the
[59:52] church right because now listen
[1:00:02] God build a body Moses saw that tried to
[1:00:06] put it in language couldn't sir
[1:00:08] David saw his message he could try to
[1:00:11] tell Solomon Solomon puts it over in the
[1:00:13] best he can do all they can do it was
[1:00:15] temples Enoch sees it all he can do is
[1:00:19] build it up here minute but God Himself
[1:00:26] said I'll just build my own body you
[1:00:29] remember what I said a minute ago
[1:00:30] because that's what the scripture said
[1:00:32] the scripture plainly says or in acts
[1:00:36] another heard he said if I wanted to
[1:00:38] outside build it himself and he did he
[1:00:43] build a body he just borrowed it wound
[1:00:48] to build a body but now listen there was
[1:00:55] only one body that was a tabernacle for
[1:00:59] Almighty God to come down and dwell in
[1:01:01] that body become United together with
[1:01:07] that soul and spirit until it was
[1:01:10] Almighty God dwelling on earth the body
[1:01:15] had to be redeemed because it was not
[1:01:17] sinful but because it was had a
[1:01:19] beginning it was made eternal now the
[1:01:25] body is the body of God right exists in
[1:01:31] Revelations you can see it in all of the
[1:01:33] prophet in his studies but my point is
[1:01:35] to do one time
[1:01:37] there was only one body that was not
[1:01:44] God's complete plan those his complete
[1:01:47] plan was to be a father
[1:01:48] a healer a savior a redeemer right
[1:01:52] that was his desires in the beginning
[1:01:55] not to just the fact of coming down and
[1:01:58] dwelling with man although that's
[1:01:59] wonderful
[1:02:00] and he wanted it and it happened but to
[1:02:04] come to mankind come to mankind and let
[1:02:13] mankind now listen let mankind build God
[1:02:18] a body that's what he wanted sure he
[1:02:27] built it himself cause it that was good
[1:02:28] but he wanted something for us to have
[1:02:31] to do with it he had to borrow a wound
[1:02:36] to get the first one right there was a
[1:02:42] connection to the human race with that
[1:02:44] body even though God created eggs sperm
[1:02:50] fine but there was a connection to the
[1:02:52] human race because there was the body of
[1:02:54] Mary
[1:02:57] she was used to bring forth that body
[1:03:01] that was God building himself a body
[1:03:04] that he could dwell on earth when who
[1:03:07] was it going to hell with I mean what
[1:03:14] was it going to Elvia it sorry for
[1:03:17] saying it and being human the way I am
[1:03:19] that wouldn't have put him very much
[1:03:21] farther than David and all of them with
[1:03:23] all the buildings that at least back
[1:03:25] neither had buildings and things that
[1:03:27] they could show to people with their God
[1:03:35] comes down and he wants the tabernacle
[1:03:41] he wants the place that he can dwell
[1:03:47] let's bypass the notion preach to them
[1:03:52] God then knows he's got to make a way
[1:04:02] he provided the first body provided all
[1:04:05] the things now he knows he's got a
[1:04:07] microwave for everything to come out
[1:04:10] right so he starts dealing with a human
[1:04:13] race you don't want him to build him
[1:04:18] another building that's why you get over
[1:04:21] there being Matthew that's what Peter
[1:04:23] didn't say it said Lord let us build the
[1:04:26] tabernacle one for Moses one Elijah and
[1:04:28] one for you let us build a he said just
[1:04:31] forget that that ain't what I want I
[1:04:35] want a body made and I'm making my own
[1:04:40] but that's not the plans completed I
[1:04:44] want you to have something to do with
[1:04:46] this one you had something to do with
[1:04:52] the other he was used and brought to
[1:04:55] earth and your mind was use your control
[1:04:58] of being and you made all of these
[1:05:00] buildings and you made all of these
[1:05:02] things that Tabernacles that looked and
[1:05:04] spoke he doesn't understand I said now I
[1:05:12] want you to move up a little closer
[1:05:15] how many quotes do you need for me to
[1:05:17] read where brother Branham says we are
[1:05:20] the dwelling place of Almighty God I'll
[1:05:25] just put it this away I'm not gonna ask
[1:05:28] you did you do it but if you read statue
[1:05:31] of a perfect man you got at least five
[1:05:33] or six statements literal word-for-word
[1:05:39] that the brighter Jesus Christ is the
[1:05:43] dwelling place of God God is now using
[1:05:49] me and you to bring into finality the
[1:05:52] whole finished story and he starts
[1:05:57] building on us brothers and sisters in
[1:06:00] her soul he brings that to eternal life
[1:06:05] because his soul was eternal he begins
[1:06:09] to work on our spirit realm to bring
[1:06:12] things into being and like I said if you
[1:06:15] read the statue of a perfect man you
[1:06:18] hear brother Branham say these virtues
[1:06:21] will bill God a tabernacle that he can
[1:06:25] live in that's what the virtues is far
[1:06:31] see I didn't stop with a part you'd
[1:06:34] think I'd stop the new bar it brings
[1:06:35] eternal life into the soul of mankind
[1:06:38] yes wonderful
[1:06:42] that's not to finish the story
[1:06:45] there's more of that try on being that
[1:06:48] needs to be brought into being needs to
[1:06:51] be redeemed you see it's not just for
[1:07:00] the fact that we're a soul that God
[1:07:02] could come down and live and that way we
[1:07:04] we could say well bless God I don't see
[1:07:06] it in my soul everything is wonderful in
[1:07:08] my soul you know all of that now there's
[1:07:11] other parts for this being
[1:07:15] those virtues have to come down and work
[1:07:19] from the inside out wordly into our
[1:07:22] spirit realm that others may see our
[1:07:27] faith our virtue our knowledge our
[1:07:29] temperance our patients our beings and
[1:07:32] all because that's the type of natural
[1:07:36] God wants may I quote brother branham a
[1:07:42] church with these did you read this one
[1:07:46] a church with these virtues in it is a
[1:07:48] church that will go in the rapture he
[1:07:54] said a people with these virtues in it
[1:07:57] will be the people that will go in the
[1:08:00] rapture well God was standing there and
[1:08:09] they beat him and they've done
[1:08:10] everything in the book to him but he
[1:08:13] said Father forgive them he turned
[1:08:18] around and gave up his life
[1:08:20] God took him into eternal life in body
[1:08:23] he didn't out take him to eternal life
[1:08:25] in his soul enough to take Jesus to
[1:08:28] eternal life in his spirit he had that
[1:08:31] but he took them to eternal life in his
[1:08:33] body
[1:08:35] making a complete unit fully redeemed
[1:08:41] does he church these virtues and things
[1:08:44] has got to come in to us as individuals
[1:08:45] and dwelling us to make us his divine
[1:08:48] nature and to build him a dwelling place
[1:08:52] to build him a tabernacle a body thou
[1:08:56] hast prepared me think about that as
[1:08:58] yourself God provided you a body God
[1:09:02] came down and gave your soul eternal
[1:09:05] life right by the new Birds come on what
[1:09:09] did he do that for
[1:09:11] he laid claim on the rest of us is that
[1:09:14] the seals that's in the seal book he
[1:09:17] laid claim on the rest of this property
[1:09:20] he purchased it lay claimed on it and
[1:09:23] one day it will follow the soul into
[1:09:27] eternal life a dwelling place for God to
[1:09:32] dwell this dwelling in you you mean
[1:09:39] wasn't come on do you have the new birth
[1:09:43] is the new birth of the life of very God
[1:09:47] himself is the very soul of God divided
[1:09:51] among the people
[1:09:54] he turn alive giving you well what do
[1:09:57] you think he's done that for he brings
[1:10:00] us then to a walk this is my beloved son
[1:10:04] who I'm pleased to dwell that on the
[1:10:08] River Jordan he said he's pleased to
[1:10:10] dwell in you and I at our new birth he's
[1:10:14] pleased to dwell but that's not the
[1:10:17] finish of the product with the Mount of
[1:10:21] Transfiguration brings the adoption the
[1:10:24] stature of a perfect man brings all of
[1:10:25] those things into being and then he says
[1:10:28] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:10:29] pleased to dwell hear ye him you realize
[1:10:36] what we're doing Church we are now not
[1:10:40] will be and mova yonder back yonder this
[1:10:43] we are now the body of God what other
[1:10:48] body does he have on earth he's not here
[1:10:51] on earth in a physical body according to
[1:10:54] the scriptures his body sitting on the
[1:10:56] throne but now he comes into you and me
[1:11:05] to build a body wonderful body he's
[1:11:11] going to build the brain from that
[1:11:13] inside man out through that spirit and
[1:11:16] bring it out into that body and bring
[1:11:19] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:11:21] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:11:25] and then love what a wonderful body that
[1:11:31] God is building you said well why have
[1:11:34] we been here so long because that is
[1:11:37] what he's been doing but we've been
[1:11:39] playing around dilly dallying and not
[1:11:41] been following him and walking into it
[1:11:43] and wondering if this doctrine is right
[1:11:45] and that doctrine is right trying to
[1:11:49] follow this and trying to wonder if this
[1:11:50] is ok
[1:11:51] should we follow this person should we
[1:11:53] follow that person that's all we're
[1:11:58] supposed to follow Almighty God
[1:12:06] I stood in this message without even you
[1:12:09] heard my story I didn't have the baptism
[1:12:11] of the Holy Ghost I come in this message
[1:12:13] so you get that right and what you're
[1:12:14] thinking with some brother stood one day
[1:12:16] and talking about it cuz one of the
[1:12:18] first doctrines that struck us you can't
[1:12:20] be saved after 63 Redemption was over 63
[1:12:25] the lamb left the mercy seat I said
[1:12:27] according to my Bible and I wasn't
[1:12:31] quoting brother randomise quoting my
[1:12:32] Bible I said according to my Bible
[1:12:37] Redemption was over for the foundation
[1:12:39] of the world is that the scripture of
[1:12:44] the lamb slain before the foundation the
[1:12:46] world my Bible was telling me and I
[1:12:50] didn't have the Holy Ghost to do it I
[1:12:52] just had plain sense to think about it
[1:12:55] that you try to tell me I can't be saved
[1:13:00] I said forget it you didn't save me and
[1:13:07] you ain't gonna lose me
[1:13:11] Missy Church do you understand what I'm
[1:13:13] talking about you realize the point I'll
[1:13:16] drive it hard to say the statue of a
[1:13:18] perfect man will bring God's Tabernacle
[1:13:21] a body into being well you sound like
[1:13:29] you're trying to get the bike I'm trying
[1:13:30] to get the body redeemed that's exactly
[1:13:32] what I'm trying to do is get this body
[1:13:36] reading and as he works on me from my
[1:13:41] inside of the soul out through my spirit
[1:13:44] to bring these things into being and
[1:13:47] brings it out until the body will be
[1:13:50] completely redeemed
[1:13:54] a tabernacle for God to dwell in if you
[1:13:58] don't believe that I'm telling you I've
[1:14:00] got them laying here you're welcome to
[1:14:02] the notes why should we have to now try
[1:14:06] to prove that the Prophet said we are
[1:14:09] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:14:11] I know debt is a badness the tebab will
[1:14:15] talk to of a body and a body being a
[1:14:17] church where would you act we talk to
[1:14:24] some of these things in the Baptist
[1:14:25] Church where would you act same way you
[1:14:28] are now oh I don't know whether that's
[1:14:30] right or not yeah that sounds pretty
[1:14:32] good but I guess you could say in a way
[1:14:36] you remember that when brought around
[1:14:38] and said you can say in a way he said
[1:14:39] it's not to say in no way he said that
[1:14:41] ain't what it is the church instead of
[1:14:49] trying to find a place to go to church
[1:14:52] or to this that of the other and I'm not
[1:14:54] throwing no stones I'm just saying it
[1:14:56] why can't we settle down and realize
[1:14:59] we're the church that way you'd stop
[1:15:05] Church jumping right we realize we are
[1:15:12] the body of Christ and these virtues are
[1:15:16] to be added to your faith which brings
[1:15:19] your virtue your knowledge your
[1:15:20] temperature but own up to be your love
[1:15:23] that God will come up with because he's
[1:15:26] giving it from the inside out into her
[1:15:31] being God's plan and purpose was to end
[1:15:39] this all thing up with a future home am
[1:15:42] i right does he have a future home for
[1:15:45] us all to go to and when we go to that
[1:15:49] all born-again believers in the future
[1:15:52] home is going to be just as eternal as
[1:15:54] God is eternal because that was his plan
[1:15:57] and his purpose was to have a family to
[1:16:03] display all of these attributes father
[1:16:05] Saviour healer
[1:16:10] but worth the body of Christ we are the
[1:16:16] body of Christ God is preparing himself
[1:16:21] a body the statue of a perfect man back
[1:16:26] out into the individuals that are
[1:16:31] born-again believers come on brothers
[1:16:35] come on musicians a body thou has
[1:16:42] prepared me a dwelling plush God
[1:16:48] finishes up his dwelling place in a
[1:16:52] human body standing in eternity in what
[1:16:56] we call the future home the things you
[1:16:58] know eternity and Dyer will be his
[1:17:02] children his offspring
[1:17:06] right there will be his offspring there
[1:17:14] in that future home that is what he
[1:17:19] wanted and he will bring it to pies
[1:17:23] let's stand together think on these
[1:17:25] things or Tabernacle a body that has
[1:17:29] prepared me those are wonderful things
[1:17:34] back there you look at that and you you
[1:17:36] see they've they've got a thing over
[1:17:38] there in the in Israel that you can go
[1:17:41] and look and they've got a place made
[1:17:43] let's I don't know probably maybe twice
[1:17:47] the size of this building or something
[1:17:49] close to it and what it is it's laying
[1:17:51] out and drawing every one of those put
[1:17:53] the temple here put this here put this
[1:17:55] here put everything you know that was in
[1:17:57] back dark and they've got it laid out
[1:17:59] and you can just walk through and it
[1:18:01] tells you what they are and how all of
[1:18:06] those things what they represent it's
[1:18:09] wonderful it's beautiful but to know
[1:18:14] that I'm looking at what God come to
[1:18:17] redeem his plan and purpose is not
[1:18:20] fulfilled in a tender or a a concrete
[1:18:24] building no matter how beautiful it is
[1:18:28] if he built it of gold what would it be
[1:18:33] nothing like the body of Jesus Christ
[1:18:39] the born-again believers together
[1:18:41] together in one body in one frame what
[1:18:47] we got
