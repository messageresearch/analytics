here the ones out in the parking lot the faithful make a few announcements here before we get started number one from the Bob will be speaking Wednesday night so let's pray for him also remember brother Joel Forney he is recovering there in Charlotte and with this coronavirus and all this stuff he's up there by self sister Vanessa can't be with him are the girls or his son they can't be with him so their face time timing with him and that's about it so we just need to pray that - that's the Lord will send His blessings up to her brother jewel I know I don't like what the devil is doing to all these preachers around the message I just don't like that I don't like it at all so we need to strive more and more to be able to pray for those ones because if Satan knows if he can get the ministry then he's got the people so we we just pray that and the ones he's been picking on or the fighters there's one that will fight him him brother dying brother runs answer but Homer different ones you know so we pray that God will just restore them to get help also it was it was clear in the text message but maybe all of you didn't get the text message well do not send tithe money to the church address that was not on the ties list so it really shouldn't have been done but some people are doing that but please the church does not have a pill box or a mail box I just happened to be friends with the guy in Lula that keeps telling me that there's checks popping up up there and that's a Lula this is a Lula address so you need to send your tithes checks to brother Terrence Dale's address and I'm not gonna announce it online you can get it somehow somewhere it's on the text message it's on your list of church people addresses so send the tithes money to brother Terrence nails address in Gil's Bell Georgia okay because we don't we don't want to mix up and we know that if you send it and they send to have to send it back we call it return to sender or insufficient address or whatever it is it has to go back to North Metro and in North Metro has to send it sometimes but Terrence said he got most of it right you got most of it and I had one that was delivered to me at my house cuz I knew the man and then we took it to Terrence his house so just remember that do not send tithe to the church address we have know physically have a physical address everybody has to have a physical address because the 9-1-1 but you don't have to have a mailbox or a pillbox number so and we do not hear to church so send them to brother Terrence also when we I know there's there's not many here today that was here this morning but I want to make an announcement if you're not going to be at both services please let me know because if you're not then I can find somebody else to take your place it wants to come and man and if they want to come both services I may just cancel you out and let the people that's come in both services because the people that want to be here want to be here and not just to say well I'm coming for a service Sunday morning and I'm going back home Church had changed we're required to be at two services on Sunday I don't some people maybe make their own rules but but not to be mean I just want to tell you if you're not gonna be here to services let me know cuz I can have somebody else come in brother Danny fountain some of the different ones that wants to come they couldn't come because I thought you were gonna be here both services so if you're not gonna be here both services you need to let me know I don't need an explanation because I kind of figure out what it is anyway so just to be real frank with you but whatever situation you got if the way we're running it now please let me know if you're not going to be and I'll get somebody else and that's what some other churches are doing half of the people who come in Sunday more than half of the people kind of come in Sunday afternoon but our services are so close together till the people that I usually try to ask are the ones that usually are here both services so on in these trying times we have to be just a little bit different then we then we were before but we try to get the people here as we can if you'll notice what happened in that church that's that's not brother Fred Mullins Church is his brother's Church okay he's got a brother Mullins it's his church brother Joe had that on the text message but then he called me later because it's not brother Fred Mullins Church it's another church his brother's Church Charles I think Mullins is his name but you see that it started and got into the women to the sisters that's why I wanted to make sure we don't have no sisters here just the Lord may have done that but I just don't think that I think the men need to be here know reflect against and that we okay to a brother they'll know reflect against the women at all it's just that you're out there with your kids your kids are with other kids this one's with this when you got to go to the grocery store and you're out there more then we are and you're more susceptible to get it but we need to pray for that church because if it keeps back if it keeps happening back in churches again they're gonna they're gonna cut down on on us getting together in big groups so we just pray that the Lord will stay this thing again I still pray every day Lord stay this thing get rid of it so we can get back in me even if this is the end time I'd like for us to all get back you know I'd like for us all getting back together for a little while anyway and and we need we need each other we need to be together calling texting Facebook whatever you want to do doesn't matter FaceTime but just keep in touch with everybody if you need anything if you need anything you need to let us know I speak for brother Dale myself if you are in a need in this church and you're online or you're sitting here you need to let the church know because we we're a family we're a church family and we're in a position where we can help you a little bit if we have to so we would we would not brother Dale is the most giving person I've ever known so what's the difference now you know so when there's a real need there we'd like to be able to to help you fill it so you've got your Bibles turn the book Galatian we're in journey a believer of a believer part eight and as I said before I hope during this whole thing that you've took Abram out and put yourself in there because we've become real personal with this guy named Abram and Abraham but you're the one that's you know it's good to see that journey and it's good to read a story about his brother Tom publish always said the old war stories in the Old Testament well you know what those old war stories were actually happening but we're having war stories now where we're not paul says we're not fighting against flesh and blood but principalities and powers and and spirits and high places and that's what we're dealing with now so we're going to take the spiritual part because we can't all say well i walk just like abram did because that was four thousand years ago but as an as a type we can see that that did happen in his life and that happens in a way in your life okay I hope you're able to see that so Galatians 3 verse 16 and we'll run through the stages now I want to it's no surprise you know then in this church that that we we say preach we teach definitely three stages of grace justifications thank us Benson Holy Ghost but remember to complete the pull full plan of redemption there's six seals to complete that but we're not going to get into that we've already been into that but there is four stages because Joel tells us in the end time that I will restore the years that those four bugs eat down okay it's good to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if you don't go on you don't complete your four stages which brother branham tells us that for death messengers are death bugs eat it down and there have to be there has to be for life messengers to bring it back are for life stages I will restore in four stages so it has to be justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother Bram tells us in one place the word our adoption or as brother Dale talking about the Son of Man and that's going on into the sixth sixth seals Redemption but in the four stages of redemption we got to come to a place to where we're at to hear you him and brother Brown said hear you them so okay you come to that place of what we call now speaking condition so Abraham did come to that but he had to go through these three stages first everybody wants to jump from one all the way up to know you know you do that and like brother Branham said power without character is the tonic all right so these characters that we're talking about if you would have give Abram the power that God gave Abraham if you would have give Abram Isaac at the first part of the journey and then God tells him to go take him up on the mountain and kill him he wouldn't have done it I'm just telling you because you wouldn't neither you wouldn't know what to do what God tells you to do at the beginning of your journey but now as Abram went to Abraham Abraham melt met God in human flesh and then after that there was a long ten or fifteen or sixteen years that he grew with God then God told him go take your son up there on the mountain and kill him and that's what we're gonna talk about today so we're gonna run through this real quick Galatians 3 verse 16 the Heavenly Father would thank you for the day that you give us we pray that you just be with us take care of us be with the ones Lord that are there sick the ones that are dying from this virus Lord we pray again that you'll stay this thing father and as as you told as Moses told Aaron said run through the crowd with a sense or Lord with a censer Lord the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what we we send out to the people Lord to keep them covered especially the church there and in Marion and all the different all the churches Lord that anything has been given as sickness Lord we pray that you would just take care of that Lord we pray that you'd be with us here in the building be with the ones outside in the parking lot just take care of each one Lord your blessings have already been put out I just pray that we reach and get them today father be with us Lord take care of us Justin got us Lord in this service in Jesus name Amen so now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made now his seed he saith not and to seeds as of many I hope you see that it the promise was not made to Ishmael now there was a promise but not the promise wasn't made to Ishmael or the other seven children that Abraham had with cateura that's just natural seed but he says and to thy seed which puts it right back to spirituality puts it right back to Christ so it was the spirit that was working in Abraham the spirit that was working in Moses but now remember that was had to be just a type because Christ couldn't go inside of him he could annoy Abram he could anoint Abraham brother brems tails I think I got it here where it said the same faith that Abram had Abraham had to have so he didn't lose his faith through the whole journey and that's why the journey of a believer believed you you don't stop believing you keep having faith all the way through for even for justification how in the world can you know that your past sins were chopped off because you still remember him your neighbor might still remember him if he saw you and the person you did it with definitely knows cuz they were there but God don't so I must have faith in that's part of my journey of justification that I have faith that he's the justifier and when he justifies you that's it and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin 'el so in other words what the law did was just kind of bring you under condemnation but it didn't bring the promise right all right that it shouldn't make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise what is the promise a law is written but a promise is grace a promise is the unwritten part have we come to now the seals brother Brown talks about the unwritten part of the Word of God if you want to continue on up the the revelation ladder I always say you're going up that revelation ladder the inheritance bill the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise you may be seeing the Lord as blessing the reading the word in Hebrews 6 verse 13 when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater swear by himself saying surely blessing I will bless them multiplying I will multiply they know us and so after he had patiently endured like I said before he did not give he gave the promise to Abram but now he didn't have the promise son at the beginning he had 25 years he had to wait and so after he had patiently endured we patiently endured since the Prophet in 1963 opened the seals and gave us the Revel at full revelation of the whole Bible everything was revealed under the seals we've been now almost sixty years since that time so God has been patient and you and I have been patient so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise because what is our promise sure our promise is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that's beginning of the promise the full promise is a body change in this end time that's why I said to four messengers everybody else has had three to deal with Luther Wesley we talked about it downstairs and you can bring it back and I want to get back like brother Dale in the Old Testament and start looking because I was watching what he was talking about this morning it when he read that scripture when was the sheaf waved it wasn't waved on the Sabbath it was waved on the day after the Sabbath family now the Sabbath's not Sunday establish the Saturday so when was it right when was it waved Sunday morning when Jesus Christ resurrected the firstfruits came up the sheath on the very day the eighth day oh my god I'm gonna get back in that to myself and we may mean that may intertwine but I've been really trying to want to get back into the every feast day so if you cover that that's okay but man this morning I thought oh boy that's wonderful and I'd really never seen them cuz they said cuz I thought he just preached just one out waved it but it's the day after the Sabbath you wait on the eighth day is when Jesus Christ was waved the eight days when he's waved in you when you received the baptism of the holy ghost because you're not you don't have the Holy Ghost if you're in still in the seventh day you got to go into the eighth day or a resurrection all right so there's this Melchizedek brother Ram says when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here all the attributes we'll do in the final end every son of Abraham so if we believe what brother Brown said then we know that this has got to happen to all of us every son of Abraham every son of the faith what are we we're the faith seed we're not I don't think that we even could check back far enough and be the physical seed of Abraham and it wouldn't do you any good if you were but to see to see that you're the spiritual seed of Abraham the only genealogy book you need to go back to is this one this is where your spiritual genealogy is your natural genealogy this tells how your mom and your grandma your grandpa and all the different ones but this tells you who your father is we don't go back no further god don't have grandkids so we don't go we go by father and the Bible says that that the New Jerusalem which come out of heaven is our mother so we got a mother and a father and here you and I are sons and daughters of God mmm so look at this plan of redemption then in four stages because we're going we're going through justification sanctification we've been through the baptism of the holy ghost and now we're got we got to go where Abraham meets Melchizedek and then after so many years we're going to go to Genesis 22 where God tells him says take him out and kill him and then so now we saw in justification if you ever want to go back if somebody's just watching in Chapter 12 and chapter 13 of the book of Genesis in chapter 14 most of it is the justification because you're gonna see we'll read that in just a second but you're gonna see where the Lord speaks to Abram and says get up and leave you're gonna see also that when we get and we're gonna type Ruth what is Ruth's first stage what's the first thing Ruth does I got I wrote down hit she decides Abram had to decide whether that was God or not in Genesis 12 that spoke to him and by faith he believed it was because this guy is talking to Abram and he says I will I will make thee a great nation I will bless thee I would so not deductive reasoning Aaron but if you somebody comes and tells you that I will all these things and is humanly impossible for a human being to do it then it must be God so there's your your reasoning that Abram had because remember Abram didn't have the baptism of the Holy oh he heard a voice and the voice says get up and leave so Abram decided the same way with you and me and everybody else one day we decided to listen to what that voice told us whether that voice was from a preacher or from a deacon or an elder or anybody else that had the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you have to hear it this is what I like you brother Branham says seed life comes through the body you have to hear somebody that's been quickened before you are quicken a man you have to hear from somebody that the words already been clicking - other than that it's just conversation it's just a conversation piece and and then you know lluís will go back to his old buddies and he'll start talking about the Lord well they can receive from that but if the buddy start talking to the other buddy and all the buddies talk together they don't have the Holy what they going to talk about they gonna talk about the old things they used to do but when somebody with the seed life like Luis walks up to the crowd and they start calling my songs on Shawn so and Luis says we I don't do that anymore that's not part of me anymore let me tell you how I got changed see that's the seed life as brother Dale was talking about the seed we know the sword the Steve's the son of man but how is he sewing it you didn't hear Jesus physically speak we don't have no tape we've got what's written in this book but who's to say that that books wrong who's to say that books not I said who's to say because it can be questioned but once you get the life of that person that wrote that book inside of you then you say Amen like brother Graham said you say amen to every word you have - why because the one that wrote it is the one that's inside here looking at that and responding back to what's already been wrote because that's where you find yourself in the word because you can read this Bible and get you a little star Sunday school starts with just fine for the kids and read your scriptures but unless it becomes alive - yeah it's just a another book to read all right like what I'm saying about Abram Abram had to decide that this was God talking to him this was somebody talking to him that could fulfill all this because you know his fans probably said hi Abram yeah you got a good job you and your daddy's working together and you know your business is pretty brisk they're buying idols you know everything is good and fine and you're making some good money and cuts his Abram I'm gonna make you great now it's daddy never told him that I would say his daddy his physical daddy never said Abram I'm gonna make it great I want to give you land I want to give you a nation I will bless you and make your name great and I will bless them that bless thee and curse them he had to know it one time just like you and I had to know it one time it wasn't just a voice that spoke to you that had been speaking to you before Noah is a special type of voice that when you connect it to it something happened when you listen to that voice that called you out of the world that was a special voice now there's been many voices in my life and same way of you as sometimes that sometimes I know when the Devils talking to me now and he tells a lot truth sometimes but you have to watch his motive but when God speaks to you a lot of times he just speaks and then that's it he's gone and then that's what he did was late but with Abram see through your journey starting with justification and bring that back up again join this plan of redemption Genesis 12 through 15 - 15 but in Ezekiel to me Ezekiel is where it nails it all down and tells you exactly so let's go to it therefore saves us that the Lord I will even gather you from the people know what hey this is this is your journey of a Christian right here in Ezekiel because he had to call you out here to call Abram out I will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered in other words that bar you used to go to in that country club at least that Country Club used to go to Rite Country Club he's calling you out of those things where you've been scattered and I will give you the Land of Israel now what is the Land of Israel the promised land alright so now here we see this and and forgive me if I go over this over and over again but things open up to me more and more every time I start reading the same identical scripture like that one talking about countries where you've been scattered it is the different places you've been not not countries as far as United States Europe and all these different though it's a country you've been walking in that you should not because he's bringing you out of that country and putting you in the Land of Israel there's no promise out here this is where the promise is and that just as Israel cannot and will not be blessed unless they're in the white Promised Land you as a Christian will not and cannot be blessed when you get out of the promised land which is the baptism the Holy Ghost you thought no you can't lose it but you can sure grieve it you can sure step over into another country but he's gonna what he's gonna call you back if you're a true son you won't lose that you won't keep going in that direction no he'll call you back and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof now what is so much your life I had some detestable things did you not yeah so he's talking to me that's that Scripture is there just for me you got this I wear this for you or not take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations that covers all of us because unless you're born again you're an abomination to God sorry that's just the way it is there's no gray you're either in or out now you can be on your journey but God knows how far you gonna go in and journey and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you know we talked about this but I want to keep going back to it I will take the Stoney heart out of their flesh and I will give them a heart of flesh in other words he's starting you on your journey you're getting something new you're getting a new heart you're justified your sins have been chopped off God has done a work in your life that he has not done in billions of other people's life but he's doing it for you because you responded and you decided that that was God talking to you and you decided you as I've always said you get sick and tired of being sick and tired right when you get sick and tired of being sick and tired then God can work on you all right so let's hold on to that because he's going to take the Stoney heart out and give you a heart that he can work with that's in justification sanctification Genesis 15 we know Genesis 15 starts I said after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision now remember he's still Abram he's still Abram he's still doing the some things you know that maybe he shouldn't be doing and like I said before he took a lot with him and you take a lot with you when you take off on your journey all right let's go to sanctification Genesis 15 don't go to get but go right there that's fine but in Genesis 15 16 is sanctification if you want to keep reading that that where God put Abram to sleep told him he was zeroed out he had no because you can't sanctify yourself you can't justify yourself for sure but you can't sanctify yourself you of your own self remember the unclean spirit goes out but remember there's still a place that he can come back to be careful with that because he'll give you what he'll give you a religious spirit and think everything's okay but now Abram didn't stop when all this was done all these sacrifices all these different things God showed him hell death brother Brown tells all these things that he showed him but when Abram walk woke back up he just kept running walking he didn't say all right I'm done I can't do this in the morning he turns running goes no he just kept on going get something that makes a mistake because he takes Hagar and has a child but it's not the promised child it's not the promise he gets the promise but he's not the promised child that's not perfect well that's permissible because the Bible says that the bondwoman will not have anything to do with the free woman now the bond woman was who that was Hagar all right we don't want to be bound we want to be with the free woman which was Sarah all right so you see where the true purpose of the plan and promise was with Sarah the whole time not with Hagar but but God allowed that to come in to give us another group of people that can come into the kingdom that gets another promise that can live outside the city that can be not born again listen they won't be born again foolish version never gets born again if you get born again you're a born again baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit filled child of God and you live in the city seed of Abraham but now the seed of Hagar and or not Hagar but the seed of Ishmael they can live outside the city they can be imparted or given a promise are given eternal life which is the foolish virgin cup of water my name people that don't make it to the age of accountability we forget those people sometimes and I also want to remember one other group I was thinking about this the other day and what what a great guard that gave us a prophet I got a friend of mine Timmy McCoy that's got a Down syndrome girl and she's about 30 held she attends about 30 something about 30 33 that's okay lar Beth you know brother Brown said those kind of children had a special angel that was with them from birth you know why because they're gonna be given eternal life they can't be judged for they what they are in the condition they're in so what a mighty God that sent us a prophet to clarify all that people that like that that are down syndrome they're gonna be there but you know what their soul is not down syndrome that's why brother Ram said he said that's the splitting of a cell from what happens out here in the world no no no disrespect to Tim Ian and Kathy at all it's just something to happen in the birth natural happening in the body but God made provision that when that when that baby came forth he gave lore about the soul but that soul is gonna be eternal not then now she'll have to go to white throne judgment but still that you see all these provisions you say well what are you saying she's she's under a promise she's under a promise now not the promise of Abraham she'll never be a seed of Abraham but she can be a seat of Ishmael she can be a seed that your seems eternal life or receives a promise thank God I when I see downs children I I hate it for them but you know what this is what I also think there's mama and daddy don't go to church don't care nothin about God but that person that they brought up that way that condition the turn they're gonna be given eternal life the parents are not they may not be but there's a person that's that's I always think of duty people brain-damaged stuff like that God makes provisions for that he's he's a graceful God and so he puts a we're not supposed to be part of the bondwoman but yet the bondwoman wasn't cast that sure she was cast out of the home naturally but God still remember she was sitting by well she was getting ready to die thirsty get ready to feed the Ishmael and God come says he sends an angel says I'm gonna take care of you now why need just leave it alone if it was so trashy and so bad no there has to be another line there of be given eternal life or permissive will that's going to populate this whole world probably a hundred times more than the bride but that's okay that's all right but you and I have been called to be the seed of Abraham that's our call that's our promises to be these seed children of Abraham for I will take from among you the healer now this is a Ezekiel 36 now when we read before was Ezekiel 11 so this is going up a little higher as Ezekiel 36 says for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land so he's got to bring you out then I will sprinkle clean water upon you washing to the water of the word remember this is sanctification what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service with water everybody got that same AM and ye shall be clean didn't say that back in the other way just gave you a new heart right now we're talking about cleaning up in sanctification from all your filthiness and all your idols will I cleanse you now remember this scripture because when brother Branham speaks and tells us he tells us that he gives us a new spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit so this is not going about the Holy Spirit a new heart well I give you justification and a new spirit will I put within you that's not the Holy Spirit Colette seat he doesn't say that's my spirit he said I'll give you a new spirit within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh so he's going to do this to help us in our sanctification look at number two hidden life in Christ I'd like to stop here possible and tell you some things on that your little created yourself he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't God spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him now that's third stage of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or you couldn't even live with you he's not gonna live you with you when that unclean spirits inside Luke verse Luke there in Luke whatever it is 11 it talks about the unclean spirit going out well you know what's gonna happen gonna work on you while that thing's gone because he can finally touch you a little bit remember he picked the jar up but he sets it down and still nasty but he's starting to clean it up he's getting ready to put it in service he had put it in service yet but you know what that is the glass see that's where we can go back to predestination when he picked it up it was a glass when it was made it was a glass but he got put in the mud that's not the purpose for that glass the purpose for that glass is to be clean so you can drink out of it everybody got that amen to a predestination God knew by foreknowledge that you know they some cups is gonna stay in there because he knows they won't stay clean become the bus but he knew when he picked you up those who is justified he is already drink from the cup God can do that we can't because we look at it and go I still that's kind of nasty to me but you know what God's got a plan and a purpose God knows that that thing's got to start from the inside out starting with sanctification but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you see he's got to get you fixed up first before he can come in I'll give you a new spirit then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places mainly Church and get around other born-again people cuz you really don't know how to act because remember the unclean spirit goes out but you still got that old nature and still hanging on until the until the what until the cutting of the foreskin you still got that old nature but when God comes and fills you up in seals you then you got the nature of God and you just keep moving on as Abraham because remember during this part of the journey it's still Abram Abram it's not turned to Abraham until Genesis chapter 17 when he's given this he's got faith and he's given the seal of circumcision - what all right you're Abraham you're not going back to Abram no more you're Abraham now you can complete the promise I gave you when you were Abram he's got to get you fixed up so he can so what so you can entertain him right now most of us did not entertain God right before we been Christians we entertained that other guy oh yeah number three in travail notice you put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirits you have in you everybody says amen and he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen I will put a new spirit in them and I will put my spirit in them that's later on and after he gives you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you all right any will so let's look at the new birth real quick excuse me Genesis 17 starts the new birth we went through that we see that in Genesis 17 Abram was ninety years old and nine and the Lord appeared to Abram and said I am the Almighty God don't go you're fine then he goes right back to what he said before I will make the exceeding fruitful I will establish my covenant verse eight I will give unto thee I will be their God this is my covenant that ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed afterwards every man child among you shall be circumcised and we're talking about circumcision now remember circumcision watch this real quick let's read this right here let's read what brother Brown says about circumcision real quick Ezekiel 36 let's read this here now here we go to the same thing we were originally read in Ezekiel 36 verse 25 to 26 now let's add to 28 Rob will take from you among the heathen and gather your out of all your countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean for all your filthiness from all your idols will I cleanse you and a new heart also will I give you in a new spirit well I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh now that's what we stop but when we go on to verse 27 now here's where brother man I'm talking about and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and you shall dwell in the land that I give to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be their God brother Branham says in hidden life with Christ number 4 then the Bible said he would give us a new heart and he will give us a new spirit many people even Pentecostal people in full gospel people has been deceived in that and many people in the message because we see the people falling away brother Claude now we're talking yesterday and you know brother Brown said that Satan can impersonate all nine spiritual gifts well you know what we always go to tongues and interpretation but there is wisdom in there now we have the spirit of wisdom on this side but if Satan can impersonate he can have somebody like the brother in North Carolina preached thirty years the message of the hour with a good knowledge of the message and then leave you see what wisdom he got though he got the wisdom up from the other guy I'm sorry that's just the way it is I mean it I'm not saying anything bad against the brother but when you turn and say brother Brown was lying now see he lied to the people what are you saying then everything is a lot all 1,100 sermons everything take it we'll just wipe his history out if it's one you know if he's life he's lying but you can have wisdom without having God's wisdom what's the point we were talking about you can have the nine spiritual gifts a lot of times and and they'd not be the route from coming from the right guy because if he can impersonate him then that's what's happening now well this is not an impersonation when he puts his spirit God puts his spirit inside of you he's took out the old spirit and done away with that other guy and give you his spirit many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his spirit that's your spirit then I will put my spirit in you I will give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the holy spirit and trusting upon emotions and signs and let me put nine spiritual girl told if he can impersonate them you got to be careful when your life doesn't pivi up to that now that's just a little role but remember it's the truth many people that spirit that new spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his spirit well some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with God if you'd come in that's right so doubtful up and down God has to give you a new spirit giving you nature so you can get along with his spirit when it comes I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then puts his Holy Spirit in there amen to dwell with you and abide with you everybody got that we've been over this over and over but I want to read number five impersonation of Christianity just go to the red part his spirit was different from your new spirit and many people get the new spirit and think they got the holy spirit they got feeling how me happy jump around maybe do a few things religiously and they think that they got the Holy Spirit oh no the Holy Spirit makes you act different the Holy Spirit makes you think different the Holy Spirit was put right in the middle of your new spirit and your new spirit was putting right in the middle of your new heart the new heart the new spirit in the middle of the new heart and God said I'll put my spirit in you you just got the love of God so down in you till you just live it it isn't you it's something in you now that's not now also let's read these next few because the circumcision brother Brown says there's one in the church beautiful God took crossed at Calvary tore him apart soul and body he sent the body upon his right hand and sent the Holy Spirit by the covenant with the people and you and you believe by faith like Abraham did and he was given the seal of circumcision for a confirmation of his faith and you believe and accept Jesus as your Savior then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith that's why you and I are the faith seed of Abraham you say you believe it hadn't received the Holy Ghost something's wrong with your faith God circumcised is the heart the minute the believer really comes in full surrender say that say that folks surely must have done something I felt that even back then that in other words he felt somebody kick him back from him out in the audience I believe when the believer firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ but like I said before he's probably preaching the Pentecostals and people say well you got to speak in tongues you got to interpret you got to do this cuz that's what their evidence is if you don't speak in tongues you ain't got Holy Ghost in the Pentecostal realm especially back when in 19 and 53 when he's preaching this oh yeah then Pentecostals believe speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost but he's not telling he's telling said look when the believer firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God's under obligation to give him the Holy Ghost confirmation of his faith say what's the matter brother Branham just your faith that's all if you'd surely believed God's there to give it to you number seven commit God's commissioning Moses oh I thought I got the Holy Ghost when I believe they still teach that but it's wrong faith all right faith is good now remember there's a quote up further in the message where brother Branham says faith alone won't do it Wow we'll get into that later on thanks God abraham believed God and it was imputed or reckon unto him for righteousness but God give him the seal of circumcision as a seal of his faith when you get pure genuine faith in God God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the seal of the promise which is a seal that you have faith not that you'll get it but you have faith you might make some kind of an impression or make people believe or you might say you got faith but when you really got genuine unadulterated faith God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a seal of the promise amen that's not skim milk now children now let's read romans 4 verse 9 we know what happened in verse 17 about the new birth were he changes his name to Abraham changes your name to Christian because you're really not a you're really not a full-fledged Christian until you get the baptism of Holy Ghost you're believing unto all right and that's where like you know even you're like brother man we'll talk to the Baptist once saved always saved now if you're once saved always saved and it continues on all these years then yeah but when you but when will you watch people and I you don't want to say this but I'm going to you got to say this because you look at people that you look at their life and and maybe back at 12 years old they come up and made us shake hands turn around mmm you know signed a letter and and then they never darken the doors of a church and you see their life doesn't as brother Evan says pivi up to to what the Bible says but then when they pass away and the people do their funeral especially if it's a good Baptist they said well they got saved back at 12 years old once saved always say well now I don't agree with that and God don't agree with that and brother Branham didn't agree with that all right now but once they've to always say brother Brown said I'll go with you if it's once saved always going to the end and you keep seeing the characteristics of God all the way through their life but that's a gross error to tell the people that because Paul looks at them and says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe amen but you got it's all based on faith that's this journey of a believer believing you got to believe something everybody okay with that you got to leave something so let's just believe that God's gonna give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost or are you already give it to us but now when you do that you don't just sit down Abraham just didn't sit down and chair and say I'm done no man he still met God fed a calf to him made butter went through his life took his son up to a mountain it's just a lot we have to do brother Brown said wants time and I know it's quoted here many many times brother Ram tells us brother Dale's told us when you're when you get born again you just start your Christian journey that's just a very beginning of your journey of a believer because you're believing on two but when brother Branham says right here when God gives you the Holy Ghost because of a confirmation of your faith then there's the connection he believes all God is as a believer there's no one belief in him but there's unbelief in us but when that unbelief is driven out of that inside man and the believer that has no unbelief goes inside there and he seals it up the brother berm says you become a believer now there's a lot of doubt in your human mind and even in your spirit realm but that inside man cannot be contrary to the word because it is word can't be contrary now we know that didn't happen to Abraham because you can't get more to get in the Old Testament but it does happen to us that example is for us that Abraham continued on and like I said before he looks out and he says my lord he knew that was a man he met that Melchizedek that he had met back in his journey of justification all right let's read Romans 4 verse 9 and see what Paul says about this cometh this blessedness of then upon the circumcision only because you got to remember in the Old Testament that was a sign that you were a believer now I I have nothing to go on but I'm gonna say that every person that was circumcised I don't know if they were a believer or not cuz I mean Judas was a Jew and he probably was circumcised and he turned out to be what he was you understand what I'm saying so back in the Old Testament had to be just a type right because remember all Jews that come out of Egypt under all that yeah why wouldn't you be a believer if God fed you every day he watered you every day you clothes never wore out and that's a hard thing because buddy that was babies being born thousands a day and here they are knees a little swaddling clothes and then you see him at eight years old eight years later the clothes grew with them but they were unbelievers two million of them died in the wilderness under unbelief but yet they were what they were circumcised Jews they believed where the seed of Abraham Caiaphas was standing there in the temple totally circumcised in his flesh he could be a high priest if he wasn't but what good did it do so this is what Paul was dealing with now cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision I love this because this explains that Abraham didn't just become a believer when he met Melchizedek he didn't just become a believer when God made him and said your name is now Abraham Paul's fixing to tell you the Covenant was given when he was back in uncircumcision so the promise was given you when you started walking in justification if you truly go all the way then that's where God your faith started back there not the night you got the new birth remember the night you get the new bar or the day you get the Newburgh is the day that God confirms your faith not that you're getting faith but that you have faith and that faith has been cultivated and cultured from all the time whenever God first calls you till now because watch what he says right here he says now look how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or an uncircumcision we're all going now don't know when when Abraham circumcised itself that's when he started believing no he believed that day when God called him into erv Chaldees out of that room that he was in making idols because look what's right here how's it reckon was it in circumcision or uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of what us all of them that what believe that's why this journey of a believer though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also romans 4 verse 18 once what it says who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his body now dead circumstances when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb now remember he didn't just take him back to young men and women brother Brahm says I've got the quote in there I may use it next week but he says he actually had to heal Sarah in her womb because he could have turned her back to twenty years old and she wasn't fertile to begin with they've been having relations for so many years and never had a child but you know he was fertile because he had a child with Hagar and he had an inch male so what and listen it's not the male's problem in this in this journey that we're in it's the females problem the male Jesus Christ is fertile he sold seed and that's he's gonna come up our problem is is we haven't received that seed I'm not talking about us I'm dumb people that are not born again I have not received that seed or you receive it but you kick it out because remember you can and then you get to this part and then remember you go to where it's a dry land and then you go to where this happens and that happens and you die remember in the sower of the seed there's different different stages he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed or reckoned or counted to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we look if we believe because listen many people who the dawn of time are from the time the Bible was written or the time even that Abraham comes on the scene many people have read Abraham's story and not got one thing from it right now I got one thing from just a good story it's a good story about a man and all you know we had to have a prophet to come and tell us that God changed their body because it's not written fully in the Bible that God changed their body but now being in the end time you and I look at that it huiqian that because that's our promise what promise Martin Luther to get the body changed when promise Wesley get the body change it was promised for us to take a body change so God had to through a prophet show us it's already in the Bible so they could receive the promised son but for us also to whom it shall be imputed our wreck and if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead now let's go to Genesis 18 that's where we were at last Wednesday night cover it just a few minutes then we'll get to Genesis 22 maybe we'll get finished with that just a few minutes this 202 12 ok chapter 18 we won't go to it just stay right there because we're gonna read a quote from who's this Melchizedek because I wanted to come back we were explaining this Wednesday and for those that may be or not that are watching in that maybe doesn't know anything about the prophet of God that we had in the end time and all that we had a prophet come and tell us he was identified in the scripture identified in the Word of God all the way through the Word of God has been the church days being a messenger to bring us what clarity clarity he didn't bring us a new Bible he didn't bring us a we didn't have to do like the Mormons and have to write a new Bible no he gave us clarity for the Bible that we already have all right and gives us not an idea cuz if I didn't bring the quote I'm gonna tell you what brother Ram said do you know when Abraham when Isaac looks at you said it this morning when Isaac looks at Abraham and says daddy here's the wood here's the fire but where's the sacrifice brother Bryan said that was an Abraham that spoke when he said God son God Himself will provide a sacrifice he said that was God speaking through Abraham and there was the realm because remember look Abraham didn't have any creative power Abraham in itself couldn't create so what he spoke through I hope I got it in here maybe I did I read so many it's like 127 quotes for brother and talks about them going up on the mountain so let's just read this real quick I'm stay right there Dennis chapter 18 the Lord appeared to Abraham now what was this this was a man this was not that's what I'm going to say about the people there there's that one school of thought that Melchizedek was just a myth or that Melchizedek was a priesthood which we see that even in the end time now they have people out there that are under the Melchizedek Priesthood but now we must read in the Bible though where Paul picks it up the great Apostle Paul and he tells us he says this man doesn't have a father doesn't have a mother doesn't have a beginning of days doesn't have an end of days he said so obviously whoever that person was is still here today so it had to be a person not priesthood so so what did Abraham meet he met God in human flesh a pre figure of the Son of Man because remember hold on a minute that son of man we were promised had to be born like we were born Melchizedek wasn't it was a body spoken into existence but it was still taught in human flesh but that wasn't our brother that wasn't our Savior but now down inside was our Savior there's a little you be little technical there it was the same person theophany person but not the same flesh because that flesh that died for me and you had to come the way we came no sex though but God placed the womb in the womb of egg in the germ and there was a body that come on people it didn't come from nobody on earth but yet it was a human body that grew older had to go to the bathroom had to eat cried had had a gurney but down inside of him was that same man who spoke to Abraham because remember he said before Abraham was I am so he was identifying that that Melchizedek that was standing in front of Abraham was a pre figure brother Brent says of Jesus Christ but that flesh remember that's not our Savior standing there the man inside is but now that is God in human flesh because brother Ram says that the Son of man has to appear reappear in the end time to talk to Abraham seed so who has gotten human flesh we're not looking for another man to come we're looking at men and sisters that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost sometimes we forget them because if their God in human flesh they're part of the Son of Man ministers brother Dale was talking about this morning I say not ministry up here I mean the son of man ministry in the end time they're covered under that son of man ministry which is what God human flesh but remember as we say before that this great person was not a myth it was God no more no less it was God Almighty standing there in human flesh talking to Abraham because remember the Bible a myth Kania cow even if the - II can't eat a cow remember remember what they if this doesn't help you God help you to see it when brother Brown went across that curtain of time what's the first thing they said we don't eat here that's what the Alpha knee the Alpha knees don't eat so for Melchizedek to commune with Abraham he had to get in human flesh hey man so it had to be a human man standing in front of him that when he ate the calf you say where did it go it went side of him he had a stomach but when he dropped that flesh and stepped over back into that faster dimension he went right back to the theophany that didn't need to eat didn't have to eat but what is he doing now he's showing like I said the first quote he's showing that the sons of Abraham the seed has to come face to face with God in human flesh in the end times everybody agree with that same am I agree with it I mean that's just what he's got to be remember he washed his feet he fed him then here comes as this man says I will certainly return unto the according to the time of life so God it had to be God cuz they're set ninety nine year-old Abraham they're set 99 or eighty nine year-old Sarah she was dead anyway womb was and this man sitting here it's talking to them too and looking them both in the eye of course Sarah goes back in the tent but he says hey look I will visit you I will Abram couldn't do it Abraham me Abraham couldn't do it I will certainly return unto the according to time of life and Sarah thy wife shall have a son and then of course Sarah sniggered Sarah laugh within her heart saying am i waxed old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also you know you know what I'm talking about and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore it why did Sarah laugh saying shall surely bear a child it's anything too hard for the Lord boy he just cut it off right there is anything too hard for the Lord but see remember Abraham had a revelation of who that person was Sarah may not have had a revelation exactly of who that person was but under but remember brother brother Brown said Abraham said that God would have killed Sarah look how there Abraham them being Christ showing Christ standing there as what the male with the weaker female behind him doubting but I'm sure that the next day or two abraham looked at Sara and said you were that close to dying but see this is the way I see it Abraham looked at Sara said but you can't die there's nothing you can do if we can see that God has turned his brother said you can do nothing they'll cause you to die I'm gonna bring that promise God said he's gonna bring that promise to me in you oh praise the Lord through last and his transferred from Abraham that faith in Abraham Christ is nothing but faith but he has to transfer it to a bride so that she can believe is anything too hard for God Lord said shall I hide anything from Abraham we're at the end time folks God can't hide anything from us we have the open book and we know that later on the baby was born but let's read this in number 8 who is this Melchizedek 1965 and just let him explain who this person was think of this great person of how great this man must be and now the question is who is this man theologians has had different ideas but since the opening on the Seventh Seal look the opening of the seven seals the mysterious book that's been mysterious to us according to revelations 10 1 through 7 all the mysteries this wrote in this book it's been hid down through the age of the reformers it's supposed to be brought out into view by the angel of the last churches how many knows that say men congregation says they're men that's right supposed to be brought all the mysteries of the mysterious book is to be revealed to the Laodicean messenger of that age seeing there is much dispute about this person in this subject I think it behooves us to break into it to find out who this is now there are several schools of thought on him one of the schools are claims he's just a myth he wasn't actually a person well the Bible says a man and that man ate a calf and that man talked to Abraham so it was definitely a person it can't be that no I'm the other say it was the priesthood that was the Melchizedek Priesthood like I said before if you'll pull up milk as it priesthood there's people in the country that build religion our religion on saying that they're part of the Melchizedek Priesthood just like that people are now saying that they're under the spirit of Elijah that's not one person not the melikhaya four is not one person is the spirit see what they do they're dividing it out we know that's not true it was a priesthood that's the Melchizedek Priesthood that's the most likely one look brother Brown says that's the most likely one that holds better to that side than they do to the other it's because they say it was the priesthood now watch it can't be that for in the first first first fourth first it says he was a person a man so in order to be a person has to be a personality a man not an order but a person so he was not just a priesthood order neither was his myth he was a person and the person is eternal if you notice he had no father no mother no time he ever began he had no time he ever ended and ever who it was it's still alive tonight because the Bible said here that he had neither father and a mother beginning of days or ending of life let me ask you a question I was reading this the other day and I've been reading about Joshua so I went to Joshua Joshua it means Jehovah Savior which he's a type of Christ right right you know who he was the son of who was he the son of nun anybody get that anybody get that he was the son of nun no father no mother no beginning of days no ending of life Joshua the son of nun is that okay I'm that's the way I see it when you look at Joshua Jehovah Savior our type of Christ's leading and putting everybody in position didn't have a father a mother now Jesus Christ brother right now you said Jesus Christ now you look at Jesus Christ and he's he had a father and a mother and now you have to be careful with that one but this man that were talking about here he had no father no mother no time he ever began he had no time he ever ended everything it was it still here tonight because the Bible said he I need the father the mother begin lasering a wife so it had to have to be an eternal person so now let me ask you a question if the son of man is supposed to be prevalent in the end time what are we looking for an eternal person if you're born again tonight you are any pearl person an eternal person so it could only be one person and that's God because he's the only one that's eternal amen so God revealed himself to Abraham after the circumcision after he come to a place to where he he knows that when he looks at Abraham and says Abraham Abram you're gonna be changed to Abraham and here's Sarah your wife and you two are going to have this promise child abraham believed God the Bible says and it was imputed or reckoned to him for righteousness all right cuz God didn't tell him he's gonna have him by anybody else he said you like I said before if we can believe that that the promise is made that we're going to bring the promised child just as Ruth come through what four stages three stages and then what was the last stage of Ruth we'll get into it next Sunday the last stage of Ruth was Ruth getting what a reward the fourth stage is a reward for going through the other three stages the fourth stage is getting a reward of coming to here to where God can use you just like right here in Genesis 22 now we need to go to Genesis 22 physically go to Genesis chapter 22 so if you'll pull Genesis chapter 22 up we'll go through this and read it give him a minute they'll probably understand we get it all right look and it came to pass after the-- after these things you look at so many times God writes in the Bible after these things what after these thing he's put us through he's put us through tests and trials and all these different things and Abraham coming through these different things and look all the different things that go on but now watch in chapter 22 look the offering of ossie this is where God has let you walk through your Christian journey for years and you've grown up with the child and you've got to know the child he ain't a child anymore he's grown up I'm talking about you you've grown up you've learned to trust Papa God you've learned but God's going to make sure that you're sure that you're sure everybody got there he's gonna make sure he he not he knew Abraham was going to kill that child because he was coming down with the knife and the angel stopped him and God says now I know we'll reinterment God says I know now we're not gotten you before the foundation of the world but Abraham didn't know and here's our still example this is our fourth stage he's already been through three stages justification sanctification about tiffin the Holy Ghost having the seal of circumcision and God meeting him in human flesh and telling him what was going on and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart you know even as Christians we always hinge on well you know when brother Dale is preaching or somebody's up here preaching him and he's in the center realized that certain things which is good but you know what even us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need to be trained we need to hear from God we need to have our feet stepped on because of the little some things that we do hey man got okay we still need that even when we're up here in the mature Park because it remember now look Abraham gave Sarah away after he got cell circumcision come on I got it right here Genesis 19 and 20 and 21 9 10 and 20 even Scofield says Abraham's laps at career that's where you get the point where brother Brown says here's this old woman and old man making a 300 mile journey but remember God had already changed them back then they go down and they meet the Pharaoh who can have any woman he wants in the land and he looks at Sarah which is at that time like 90 years old supposedly and brother Branham says that I said there's pharaohs and all that old grandma I just love her I think I'll take her to wife and he's got 300 beautiful women behind him know she had been changed back to a beautiful young woman when they made that trip but there was time that he lapsed right here Abraham Abraham there was still trash to remember and sister Shepards dream there was trash being put out what this right here cuz we get up to adoption you got to get up there to the top amen they came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he said behold Here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac so not anymore not anything else did it happen anywhere I take Isaac then the only Son Jesus Christ was what the only begotten of the Father and then so take thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get the end of the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell the earth now watch on a mountain on a mountain on a mountain on a mountain it's where God's going to tempt Abraham on a mountain after he's went through 12 or 14 or 15 years of going fishing with this boy and hunting with this boy and teaching him all the things and men that's my you know what Abraham said there's my promise now he can't become a father of Nations because now he's a young man now God's telling you to take that young man that you've been dealing with all this time and go up and killing Abraham look he didn't question him either Abraham rose up early in the morning saddle disaster took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went into the place of which God had told him hey brother Brown said watch this then on the third day after he went through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost on a higher plane that we don't have time to get into now but on the third day they weren't there read your Bible on the third day they weren't there they looked up and saw where they were going so after the baptism all the ghosts you got to go to that mountain you still got to go up to that mountain then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I'm the lad will go yonder and worship watch this and come again to you what at what a faith now in the back of his human mind he heard God tell him he's gonna take him up there one way and the boy ain't coming back right humanly he said go up there and sacrifice take him to that mountain and sacrifice him and you're not coming back down here watch but here's Abraham and the lad will go yonder and I and the lad will go yonder and worship now in order to worship you got to have a sacrifice so he's saying something here and it looks like he's contradicting itself but he's not he's going to worship having faith that God's going to give him another something to do another sacrifice or another animal watch and come again to you and after Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac in other words in a pre figure of Christ putting the cross the wood on his shoulders right we got to type Christ in this now because I think is the promise son if I got that say man don't go sleep on me then Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand who's the daddy the dead he's typing Almighty God he's got the fire you can't have a sacrifice without fire the Holy Ghost in fire he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father's and my father and he said here am I my son he said Behold the fire in the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering Abraham said my son look I miss quoted this I knew I did so I'm gonna get to it where I can really quote it what my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together God will provide himself a lamb now to me that's not saying God's gonna provide a lamb God will provide himself because that Lamb of God was God himself he provided himself that's what brother Branham saying and I don't know if I brought it or not we'll read it but he said that was and Abraham talking he said that was God speaking through Abraham as brother Del's talking about now here that's not just at the Lord that's not just after Lord that's the Abraham saying my son look how this adoption comes up where adoption remembers not thus saith the Lord adoption comes to you say my son God will provide himself a lamp can you just hear God standing there and all of a sudden the boy asked and then God just says out of the way Abraham you don't understand this at the moment but I'm gonna speak through you and it's gonna have to happen see what this is about coming to the adoption he's gonna speak to us and it's got to happen oh that's wonderful so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar then laid the wood on in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar and I he doesn't say it was kicking and screaming he just laid him on the altar and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord capital L Ord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou has not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns and I love what a commentator said about said look he was caught in a thicket of thorns because when Jesus went to the cross he had a crown of thorns called on his head cuz that types of Christ being crucified right in a thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place what Jehovah Jireh it is said to this day in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel Lord called unto Abraham out of the heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of the enemies and in da seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed and I believe brother Brown may be not indifferent but he says he says he was in Philadelphia one time he said see he said in thy seed shall all of Philadelphia be blessed and then he was another place in Los Angeles he said now God said thy seed all nations all of Los Angeles shall be blessed same way--with here today because what thou hast obeyed my voice obeyed my voice everybody got that say Amen but now remember the story continues on but let's stop right here and read a couple of quotes from brother Branham number nine we'll be doing right here 9 and 10 all right 7 compound names of Jehovah now when he appeared to Abraham in the form he said no Abraham I give you this little boy Isaac just a sweet little chap of about 16 years old don't tell his mother but I want you to I'm gonna make you a great blessing out of this boy I'm gonna bless all nations I promised you this for 25 years now and you've waited till Isaac's born now I tell you what I want you to do with Isaac I want you to take him up there and kill him now you go on back in the mountains to a place where I'll show you and then you kill him back there when our Abraham didn't question God he knowed that God promised that through that boy he would bless all nations and if God was going to bless them whether he was dead or alive he'd do it that's all and it had to come through there so God was able to keep his promise so he gets up the next morning got a couple of servants saddled a mule and he and the boy and the servant went on by and way back three days journey think how far back in the wilderness now remember let you in your journey and you've got continuing your journey so they went to this mountain they told the servants now you watch this little mule for me my boy huh are going up on this mountain and we're going to worship and the boy and I will return he says that twice the boy and I will return he was going to kill him how's he going to he didn't know but God had promised somehow see now let's read this last one will be doing musicians get ready to come possession the gates of the enemy and in Genesis 22 15 we read and the angel the Lord called today brahim out of heaven in a second time he said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son then blessing I will bless them multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand upon the seashore as I seed shall possess the gate of his enemy and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou has obeyed my voice now may the Lord at his blessing to the reading his word and I would like to take if you should be called a subtext my subject this morning first is testing before promise gates and the subject is possessing the enemy's gaze and this is what he said God had been testing the patriarch because he had given him a promise and when God gives you a promise he's going to test you and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that that person is worthy of the promise before he fulfills what he said or what he promises so Abraham had been promised that through his seed the whole world would be blessed that he'd have a son and this son out of him would come forth the seed now that's capital a so we know he's talking about Christ that would bless the whole earth and Abraham when the promise was given to him was 75 years old and Sarah his wife was 65 but the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but with strong giving praise to God in God time after time tested him but he come to that final test before the blessing was going to happen I believe that's where we're at today that final test before the blessing will come to the people to us the seed of Abraham that's the way it is with all the seed of Abraham God gives us that final test just before he gives the promise and if it's possible I'd like to say something here personally but I'll withhold that that final test to see how you'll react upon it and when you had given Abraham hid this test he found Abraham just as true as he was when he started that's what he's looking for now people that are as true as it was when this thing started musicians come next Sunday if you want to read the Book of Ruth you can we'll talk about Ruth would be the same thing because the route goes through deciding Ruth goes through serving Ruth goes through resting and Ruth goes through rewarding Abraham or Abram went through deciding to leave his place and go with God serving God in the capacity that nobody else has served them before Cathy just got up and walked with God then number three were where Jesus says come use all waiver and heavy-laden and I'll give you rest brother Brahm said that's the new birth it's not a day a rest of the believers in new birth so so Ruth group what did Ruth do um she rested and what happened Boaz went and did the work so we know its god doing the work not us and then and then what was she rewarded with at the end she was rewarded with a child through Boaz and then that child was given to Naomi and we'll see that how that types Sunday so god bless you that's what the four stages of Abraham's journey justification Saints kasing baptism the Holy Ghost and then getting rewarded by the promised son going to the next stage or going to the adoption part where Abraham now believes now sure he believed before but your faith has built more and more as you keep going listen one thing's for sure before we before we sing God will never devalue your faith Satan will in other words Satan will make you doubt now God's never gonna make you doubt your faith now he's gonna put you through something like you did Abraham but he's not what did he do he built he did that to build Abraham's faith he's never gonna do anything to make you doubt your faith that's not God he won't shoot what he's going to give you a little test that tests your faith but what did it do to Abraham it made him a better person same way with you now it makes you a better person as you walk as you want with God it just keeps more and more and more and more making you a better person so god bless you let's sing a song what you got there shorty [Music] won't it be a time talking with the Angels won't it be a time what do you say well I looked at my hands

want to be a time you always think about that you know you always look at what happened with Sarah and Abraham you know I've always said they Abraham probably wonderful weird that pretty girl will come from and she said I wonder where that pretty god comes from I remember you about 60 or 70 years ago looking like that but man that's when we got them people downstairs I was looking down the other day they were all those down there we need to get one for brother dick and put it down there at 18 to 20 years old because we won't see them old anymore now look Abraham got old again and died Lazarus was resurrected and died but you and I the promise we have is is that we don't have to die that we're gonna walk into what a change of the body and it's gonna be right here right not waiting some other time but right here but won't it be a time and then poor angels I and I say poor angels they aren't gonna know cuz they never had a change they've never had to walk in old old bodies before but you and I have well some are getting there but some of us you know you've had places that hurt you didn't even know you had as you get older but you'll never be that anymore brother dick I'll never have to say oh when he gets the file that chair he's over there now and he's doing the same thing and you know I know him brother dick he found somebody to talk to and brother Gary's over listening to Rachel Marlowe sitting there going my hand okay this is what you were when you were a young kid when you were a young guy so that's wonderful but god bless you love you with the love of the Lord Wednesday night we remember about the Bob preaching force and keep everybody in prayer I'll kind of let you know who the 10 or 12 that we're going to have we kind of upped it a little bit because we're able to sit six feet apart continue to wash your hands wear the face mask if you're sick and be careful out there you know Satan would love to destroy us but we got to promise Abraham he just put them blinders on and he sell that mountain he said I've been through all this journey I've been through every bit of that and I think in his human mind he thought all the way back to that day that God called him in career when he was Abram and he said Abram walk then he said Abram walk before me and be perfect then Abram you have nothing to do with this I'm going to now make you Abraham and I'm gonna give you a sign that I'm with you and then I'm gonna give you the promised son when I come and meet you in human flesh and then now you're standing on top of a mountain and God provided himself God went to Calvary and provided himself a sacrifice for each one of us to be able to start the journey and to continued all the way to the very end so god bless you let's bow our heads the Heavenly Father thank you for this day that you give us we appreciate the time we've had we thank you for the ones that are here the ones that are out in the parking lot Lord we pray again that you
