[35:44] good to be back again this evening and
[35:47] so we got a
[35:50] a few new faces one or two at least and
[35:53] uh
[35:54] uh
[35:56] trust that the lord will help us again
[35:58] tonight yes sir um i
[36:02] i believe i want to speak on the subject
[36:04] of the royal priesthood amen and um so
[36:07] if you'd like now to take your bibles
[36:12] and stand with me
[36:18] yeah thank you greg
[36:22] i believe it's first peter 2 9 i'd like
[36:24] to read to begin with here
[36:29] first peter 2
[36:33] and verse 9.
[36:36] he
[36:38] greet you this evening in the lovely
[36:39] name of the lord jesus christ
[36:42] and um
[36:45] maybe just before we read the scripture
[36:46] we can
[36:48] talk to the author once again lord jesus
[36:50] we know that
[36:52] we're unworthy to
[36:55] approach the throne of your grace but
[36:57] yet you bid us to come with boldness
[37:01] and lord we can only do that through the
[37:04] shed blood of calvary's lamb realizing
[37:07] we have no merits of our own right
[37:11] but lord we're not here projecting
[37:14] ourselves
[37:15] we're here because you have made us to
[37:18] be here
[37:19] you have made us
[37:24] meet to be partakers
[37:26] of the inheritance
[37:28] and lord you've made us acceptable
[37:33] and so now father we come
[37:36] through that channel
[37:38] a provision that you have made for us
[37:41] your children
[37:43] and lord we
[37:46] uh
[37:48] realize that as your servant prophet
[37:51] said the reason that israel had to stay
[37:53] in egypt for 400 years was because of
[37:56] the jealousy of one brother
[38:00] lord may there be no jealousy among us
[38:04] but lord may we prefer one another
[38:07] and may we recognize
[38:11] the position that you have given us
[38:13] and be willing lord to step into that
[38:16] position
[38:19] without any condemnation
[38:22] without any reservation
[38:25] lord as it's written
[38:28] he hath made us
[38:31] kings and priests
[38:32] under the lord our god amen
[38:34] it's your making lord
[38:36] so we come
[38:38] with that realization this evening
[38:40] asking you'll make it more clear to us
[38:41] that our faith might
[38:43] be able to be built up and we'd be able
[38:45] to reach out and receive
[38:48] appropriate all of these promises
[38:51] granted heavenly father forgive us of
[38:53] every sin every shortcoming now every
[38:55] wrong thought word or deed of this day
[38:57] consecrate us for this service this
[38:59] evening granite we pray as we read your
[39:01] word
[39:02] in jesus christ's name
[39:04] amen amen amen all right in
[39:10] first peter chapter 2 one verse of
[39:12] scripture
[39:15] but ye are a chosen generation
[39:19] a royal priesthood
[39:21] and holy nation
[39:24] a peculiar people
[39:26] that you should show forth the praises
[39:28] of him who have called you
[39:31] out of darkness
[39:34] into his
[39:36] marvelous light
[39:38] amen
[39:39] let's get verse
[39:40] uh six here of uh
[39:44] um
[39:46] revelation chapter one also while we
[39:48] stand
[39:49] revelations one and six
[39:56] and hath made us kings and priests unto
[39:59] god his father
[40:02] to him be glory and dominion
[40:05] forever
[40:06] you may be seated in the
[40:08] lord and we won't remember now that here
[40:12] in revelation he's definitely addressing
[40:14] the church ages that's right amen
[40:16] and
[40:19] we also
[40:22] understand and maybe we'll now that
[40:24] you're seated and comfortable
[40:26] and now that i have your undivided
[40:28] attention
[40:30] uh go with me then to colossians
[40:34] chapter one
[40:36] and we'll take two verses of scripture
[40:38] here
[40:39] and that'll give us a little better
[40:41] foundation
[40:42] platform to launch from amen
[40:46] and
[40:49] colossians 1 12 and 13. giving thanks
[40:53] unto the father which has made us
[40:56] notice here
[40:58] it's god's making amen
[41:02] giving thanks unto the father
[41:07] which hath made us
[41:09] meet to be partakers of the inheritance
[41:13] in the saints
[41:14] of the saints in life
[41:18] who had delivered us
[41:20] from the power of darkness that's right
[41:23] and have translated us
[41:26] into the kingdom of his dear son
[41:29] amen
[41:31] i want you to notice
[41:34] there's a spiritual translation
[41:38] that has already taken place
[41:40] amen correct
[41:42] amen all right
[41:44] if this spiritual translation
[41:48] taken place or doesn't take place
[41:51] in time we won't be in eternity right
[41:53] right
[41:54] there are certain things that it are
[41:56] imperative
[41:59] now amen for us to be with him then
[42:03] right right if we haven't
[42:06] received
[42:07] if we haven't heard and received and
[42:09] acted on the shout
[42:11] right
[42:12] exactly
[42:14] then
[42:15] we can't be a part of the
[42:18] voice of the resurrection nor the trump
[42:20] of god right amen there's a shout a
[42:22] voice in the trunk
[42:24] is that all right amen
[42:26] and uh
[42:27] so
[42:29] there's a translation now
[42:32] that must take place
[42:34] spiritual translation right that we've
[42:38] got to come to realize
[42:42] is
[42:42] for us now
[42:44] right
[42:45] you see we can't always put everything
[42:47] behind the sky and abide by right right
[42:51] we're not called upon to rule and reign
[42:55] as kings and priests only in the
[42:56] millennium right right come on but he
[42:59] have made us
[43:01] right now right
[43:03] king right amen and priests
[43:06] and i want you to notice this is not for
[43:08] just the brothers come on this is not
[43:10] for
[43:21] i'll read you the quote here
[43:23] where the prophet of god said have made
[43:25] us sons and daughters
[43:28] kings and priests all right unto the
[43:30] lord our god amen you see there's an
[43:32] elevator where there's neither male or
[43:34] female in christ right glory oh my
[43:38] and when the royal priesthood
[43:42] of melchizedek
[43:44] come on amen which we have come to
[43:47] the question
[43:49] is not
[43:50] and the prophet didn't entitle his
[43:51] message who was that melchizedek
[43:54] he said who is this amen
[43:57] right
[43:58] and so we see that
[44:00] there's a
[44:03] a new priesthood
[44:05] that has come forth
[44:07] and been ordained
[44:12] far and above and beyond the old ironic
[44:16] priesthood right of the law right
[44:21] and this
[44:22] is
[44:24] after the tribe of judah
[44:26] of which nothing is mentioned concerning
[44:29] the priesthood right right
[44:31] but this
[44:32] god swore by himself
[44:35] concerning this priesthood amen
[44:37] sure and we know that jesus christ ever
[44:40] liveth to make intercession for us amen
[44:43] and the old ironic priesthood a priest
[44:46] would offer first
[44:50] uh a sacrifice for his own sins
[44:54] and then for the sins of the people
[44:58] but the bible says that jesus did this
[45:00] once
[45:02] hebrews chapter 7 and verse 27 i want
[45:05] you to notice it here
[45:07] maybe we'll read back up also now
[45:10] just getting a good foundation that the
[45:12] lord will help us
[45:13] let's back up to verse 25 of hebrews 7.
[45:17] everybody had your swords
[45:20] i tell you what you should never come to
[45:22] the classroom without your textbook
[45:24] all right amen our curriculum is the
[45:27] word of god amen
[45:29] shame on you if you come to sunday
[45:30] school without your curriculum that's
[45:32] right amen hey man they taught us in the
[45:35] army you better not lay your rifle down
[45:37] right now better keep it with you all
[45:38] the time
[45:39] you better know the number of it
[45:42] amen have some ammo ready right
[45:45] yes sir
[45:46] and so as
[45:48] sons and daughters of god we should
[45:49] always keep our shorts handy
[45:51] when he is setting up on high one place
[45:53] brother said this uh interpreting
[45:57] uh ephesians 4 he led captivity captive
[46:00] and gave gifts unto men what kind of
[46:01] gifts swords all right amen swords
[46:05] so we understand that god taken his man
[46:07] but he didn't take the king sword
[46:09] and he certainly hasn't taken swords
[46:11] from us
[46:12] but he's given the swords amen glory all
[46:14] right and we all also understand that
[46:17] jesus was a five-star general amen our
[46:21] five-star champion amen and then as the
[46:23] prophet said he's put five stars up on
[46:25] each one of us right amen that makes us
[46:28] five-star generals
[46:30] yes was jesus
[46:33] ours is f-a-i-t-h right
[46:35] so we're all now what am i talking about
[46:37] an army of god right right man a royal
[46:41] priesthood right glory where the entire
[46:44] army
[46:45] is generals right five-star general amen
[46:49] amen how can we fail that's right amen
[46:52] that's right how can we fail
[46:54] right
[46:55] oh
[46:56] my god a royal priesthood now god made
[47:00] this army yep
[47:02] god made this priesthood
[47:04] he had made us right
[47:08] it's out of our own makings right right
[47:11] right
[47:12] it's not around to do it right right
[47:15] it's not the church is doing it right
[47:17] right
[47:18] amen
[47:20] it's god that hath made us right what we
[47:23] are
[47:24] you cannot when you realize
[47:27] that it's god that made you it don't
[47:30] matter what anybody else is jealous
[47:32] about right
[47:33] and you know the devil will be jealous
[47:35] over what god makes you
[47:37] because he can't be made that
[47:40] he's jealous over the position of
[47:42] fellowship even that you have with the
[47:45] lord amen because god loves fellowship
[47:49] and satan was one time remember co-equal
[47:52] with god in every respect except to
[47:53] create and brother branham said he was
[47:55] god's right-handed fellowship with
[47:58] but now he has made us
[48:01] that right
[48:03] and um
[48:06] it's
[48:07] wonderful to be called to this position
[48:11] right
[48:12] now we can't make ourselves that if god
[48:14] hasn't called you then you're just
[48:16] beaten in the air
[48:17] let's begin here hebrews 7 25 where for
[48:21] he is able also to save them to the
[48:24] outermost that come unto god by him
[48:26] seeing he ever liveth to make
[48:29] intercession for them amen now he is the
[48:32] great high priest glory and here you'll
[48:36] one of the quotes i have here before me
[48:37] brother brown said we're lesser priests
[48:40] lesser priest
[48:42] nobody will ever come to that measure
[48:45] that the head of the church
[48:47] christ
[48:49] we receive the spirit by measure he
[48:51] received it without me amen
[48:54] is that right
[48:55] now so notice here in verse 26
[48:58] for such a high priest
[49:01] becometh us
[49:04] who is holy
[49:06] blameless
[49:08] undefiled separate from sinners
[49:11] and made higher
[49:13] than the heavens
[49:14] he's exalted so high that he has to look
[49:16] down on heaven
[49:21] such a high priest
[49:23] became
[49:25] us
[49:27] i am
[49:28] he became us that we might become him
[49:29] all right amen
[49:32] he became us
[49:34] such a high priest became us
[49:37] who is holy harmless undefiled separate
[49:39] from sinners
[49:41] and made higher than the heavens who
[49:43] needeth not daily i want you to notice
[49:45] this verse real quick uh real closely
[49:46] here right verse 27
[49:48] who needeth not daily as those high
[49:51] priests to offer a sacrifice first for
[49:54] his own sins
[49:56] and then for the peoples
[49:58] for this he did
[50:02] well she catch that part right this he
[50:04] did once right
[50:06] when he offered up himself right right
[50:08] what is it that he did
[50:10] this right sure the scripture is perfect
[50:13] right amen
[50:15] that's what
[50:16] offered up sins uh offered up a
[50:18] sacrifice
[50:20] for his own sins that's right
[50:22] now holy just a bit of pepe
[50:26] are you trying to tell me jesus had sins
[50:29] the bible says this he did
[50:31] offered us a sacrifice for his own sins
[50:35] he did that first this he did once
[50:38] amen now we know as believers that he
[50:41] had not of his own that's right but he
[50:43] took yours
[50:46] he so took them
[50:48] that he tried on himself right exactly
[50:51] oh my right man here it is
[50:56] this he did once right right it was his
[50:59] sins
[51:00] right
[51:01] nothing he said nothing he was a sinner
[51:04] but that he so thoroughly and fully took
[51:08] your sins amen
[51:10] amen but the bible says this he did all
[51:12] right
[51:15] ah man
[51:16] do you realize
[51:18] that god
[51:20] when he asked the question why
[51:22] hast thou forsaken me
[51:25] my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
[51:30] there was the tree of life cursed
[51:36] for your site all right amen
[51:39] because
[51:40] to read us of the curse right that we
[51:42] came andre in the first birth all right
[51:44] amen
[51:50] as we said this morning referring to the
[51:52] point said living he loved me died he
[51:54] saved me buried he carried my sins my

[55:57] says they went and heralded the message

[56:04] wasn't a baby in the major he was a
[56:07] child in the house the bible says
[56:09] that's right and they killed all the
[56:10] children from two years old and younger

[57:25] and they also there he he said now each
[57:28] age had a dip in the holy ghost
[57:31] a dip
[57:32] in the holy ghost but now the holy ghost
[57:36] is here in his fullness

[58:31] the lord that we're waiting for but
[58:32] remember
[58:35] see john the baptist
[58:38] could not be taken off the scene until
[58:40] christ come on the scene right right and
[58:42] then john when he introduced the messiah
[58:45] yeah said i must decrease but he might
[58:47] injury right and the second forerunner
[58:52] in the end time our malachi 4 4 runner
[58:55] luke 17 4runner etc

[59:06] all right and so there's an invisible
[59:08] union has to take place here right in
[59:11] this dimension amen and he wants us to
[59:14] realize what he has made us right right
[59:17] and that he's already translated amen
[59:20] from the powers of denominational
[59:23] darkness right
[59:24] from the powers of creeds and darkness
[59:27] into the kingdom of his dear son
[59:30] and the king is an invisible union right
[59:33] because the kingdom of god cometh not
[59:35] with observation all right right
[59:37] what is the kingdom of god not meeting
[59:39] greek
[59:40] but it's love joy and peace in the holy
[59:43] ghost
[59:44] no no it stands out that the kingdom of
[59:46] god is within you amen
[59:49] right amen if the kingdom of god is in
[59:52] you and the king of the kingdom is in
[59:54] you right right amen
[59:56] amen
[59:58] oh my
[59:59] now then he wrote into his creation
[1:00:02] i went white donkey but today he's
[1:00:04] coming on white horse
[1:00:06] see
[1:00:07] who is this
[1:00:09] see what is the attraction on the
[1:00:11] mountain
[1:00:12] brother brown said a few years ago
[1:00:15] services is a time
[1:00:17] this was a prophecy now it's history
[1:00:23] what's the attraction sure see what is
[1:00:25] the attraction what was the attraction
[1:00:27] when jesus come riding into jerusalem
[1:00:29] right it was the king coming into his
[1:00:32] kingdom right the creator coming into
[1:00:34] his creation amen he was presenting
[1:00:38] himself as a king
[1:00:39] right now you'd be rejected right sure
[1:00:43] you're not a horse thief
[1:00:46] the donkeys belong to you right
[1:00:49] he wasn't teaching his disciples how to
[1:00:51] steal donkeys
[1:00:53] he was exercising the power of a king
[1:00:55] right
[1:00:56] the beast on thousand hills belongs to
[1:00:58] him right america is that right sure
[1:01:00] he's king all he has to do is speak the
[1:01:02] word everything belongs to him
[1:01:04] he's a benevolent dictator
[1:01:07] that's what a theocracy is a benevolent
[1:01:11] dictator
[1:01:12] amen and so we won't let him be lord of
[1:01:14] our lives is that true right
[1:01:17] now if we can find our place
[1:01:20] and realize what he's made us see
[1:01:24] it's not that we can make ourselves
[1:01:27] anything that's right you don't have to
[1:01:29] that's right you're not designed like i
[1:01:30] said this morning the bride is not
[1:01:32] designed to produce a child right
[1:01:35] but paul said what
[1:01:37] the word of god come out from you right
[1:01:39] yeah party come on to you aren't we all
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:43] hey yeah right
[1:01:45] you don't produce the word you receive
[1:01:46] the word and glory
[1:01:48] the bride when she realizes who she is
[1:01:52] and what her position is she can rest
[1:01:54] and receive right right amen
[1:01:56] rest receive believe conceive and
[1:01:58] produce hallelujah
[1:02:00] amen eat digest
[1:02:03] manifest amen that's right and uh go
[1:02:07] forward then right
[1:02:08] now
[1:02:10] so
[1:02:13] i i i really believe that
[1:02:18] where there were just a testifier of the
[1:02:20] gospel or a minister of the gospel if
[1:02:22] you feed on the word the holy ghost will
[1:02:24] bring that word to your remembrance when
[1:02:25] you need it yes he said he would that's
[1:02:28] right but see the problem a lot of times
[1:02:30] is we've been feeding on the wrong thing
[1:02:31] right man amen we need to empty out so
[1:02:34] we get filled up right right amen amen
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:39] yes
[1:02:40] died down
[1:02:41] they just i have nothing in there but
[1:02:43] the word of the lord
[1:02:45] and uh then he can set that word in
[1:02:48] order in our hearts and lives
[1:02:51] right i really believe that that's right
[1:02:53] amen now we're not capable of doing it
[1:02:56] ourselves
[1:02:57] and that's why we're
[1:02:59] we we're asking him and trusting him day
[1:03:02] by day to lead us to guide us to direct
[1:03:05] us
[1:03:07] i want you to notice here
[1:03:09] uh how the prophet puts this in faith is
[1:03:12] the substance
[1:03:14] our bodies are groaning
[1:03:16] and we have an inheritance
[1:03:20] and we're children now heirs of the
[1:03:22] kingdom oh my kings and priests unto
[1:03:25] god offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:03:28] right what does a priest do make a
[1:03:31] sacrifice right
[1:03:33] what is a a
[1:03:35] spiritual sacrifice
[1:03:38] that's what these sons and daughters
[1:03:42] do
[1:03:43] which are kings and priests
[1:03:46] yet not in full possession right
[1:03:49] but they're making sacrifices
[1:03:52] offering to god spiritual sacrifices the
[1:03:55] fruits of their lips giving praise to
[1:03:57] him amen right
[1:03:59] giving praise to him amen
[1:04:02] fruits of our lips
[1:04:04] you say brother brett i just don't feel
[1:04:06] like praising him
[1:04:08] that's the time to make a sacrifice amen
[1:04:13] praise him anyhow
[1:04:15] kings and priests right sons and
[1:04:17] daughters
[1:04:18] offering spiritual sacrifices the fruits
[1:04:21] of our lips giving praise
[1:04:24] unto his name right that's right
[1:04:26] they asked
[1:04:28] one outstanding minister one time what
[1:04:30] do you do when you don't feel like
[1:04:31] praying
[1:04:32] he said well i pray till i do feel like
[1:04:35] praying
[1:04:36] all right hey
[1:04:38] that's the time when you offer a
[1:04:39] sacrifice right
[1:04:41] you know
[1:04:42] and the bible says that we're to present
[1:04:44] our bodies right a living sanctuary
[1:04:47] all righty man
[1:04:49] holy unacceptable unto god we suggest
[1:04:52] our reasonable service by that that's
[1:04:54] right man is that right right and so a
[1:04:57] living sacrifice you know a dead
[1:04:59] sacrifice don't suffer
[1:05:01] but there's a measure of suffering left
[1:05:03] for you right amen scripture speaks to
[1:05:06] the sufferings of christ left back for
[1:05:08] the church doesn't fill up right and
[1:05:10] also inflicting says for unto you it is
[1:05:13] given in behalf of christ not only that
[1:05:15] you believe upon him but that you suffer
[1:05:17] for his namesake right right
[1:05:20] see we want fly our bed of ease right we
[1:05:22] want to just go in without any suffering
[1:05:24] yeah but no pain no gain that's right
[1:05:27] this character is only made through
[1:05:29] suffering right
[1:05:31] if our lord the the chief priest
[1:05:34] melchizedek himself had to learn
[1:05:37] obedience through the things he suffered
[1:05:39] yeah how many knows the bible says hey
[1:05:41] all right man hebrews he learned
[1:05:43] obedience by the things he suffered how
[1:05:45] much more do you now live amen
[1:05:47] oh my don't be afraid to do a little
[1:05:49] suffering
[1:05:50] paul said i reckon the sufferings of
[1:05:52] this present time we're not even worthy
[1:05:55] they're compared with what he hath made
[1:05:57] us amen what shall be revealed in us
[1:06:00] right oh my so we see here now
[1:06:05] that he's addressing the church
[1:06:08] and uh
[1:06:09] the seven spirits was represented in the
[1:06:11] seven
[1:06:12] spirits that would be sent forth to the
[1:06:13] seven church ages
[1:06:16] and um he had loved loved us and washed
[1:06:19] us
[1:06:21] from our sins loose to see right and
[1:06:23] from our sins in his own blood
[1:06:26] and hath made us kings and priests under
[1:06:29] god his father right to him be glory
[1:06:32] dominion forever and ever amen
[1:06:34] have made us priests and kings under god
[1:06:38] right us plural amen
[1:06:41] that's right
[1:06:43] not made me
[1:06:45] king
[1:06:46] made us
[1:06:48] all right
[1:06:49] the church amen all right
[1:06:53] now
[1:06:54] he's addressing the seven church ages
[1:06:56] for the seven church ages four it's the
[1:06:58] seven
[1:06:59] peace now
[1:07:01] he said dominion and glory
[1:07:04] be
[1:07:06] be to him forever and ever hath made us
[1:07:10] do you ever know what a priest is
[1:07:12] what is his what his office is a priest
[1:07:15] is to make sacrifice to make
[1:07:16] intercession
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:20] and over in hebrews it said that we
[1:07:23] uh the church
[1:07:24] is the royal
[1:07:26] priesthood a royal
[1:07:29] priesthood the church
[1:07:31] is a royal
[1:07:33] priesthood a holy
[1:07:35] nation amen
[1:07:37] a peculiar
[1:07:38] people
[1:07:40] offering spiritual
[1:07:42] sacrifices heaven
[1:07:45] every man and woman that comes to god
[1:07:48] enters into the veil amen
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:56] aaron the high priest only once a year
[1:07:59] was permitted to go into that holistic
[1:08:01] hole
[1:08:02] yeah
[1:08:03] and then he better know everything's in
[1:08:05] order that's right
[1:08:07] because
[1:08:08] if he didn't have everything in order
[1:08:11] the bell stopped ringing yep i had to
[1:08:13] drag him out one way or another is that
[1:08:15] right right right get him out of there
[1:08:17] because he didn't he was he went in the
[1:08:18] wrong approach right right what a holy
[1:08:20] sacred god amen but now every member
[1:08:24] hallelujah
[1:08:27] he's invited
[1:08:28] because the veil was ripped from the top
[1:08:32] to the right
[1:08:34] and the mercy seat is in plain view and
[1:08:36] you have no excuses right
[1:08:38] i have no excuses that's right you don't
[1:08:40] have to go through some general overseer
[1:08:44] some pope or some bishop to intercede
[1:08:46] for you there's one mediator right
[1:08:48] between god and man amen
[1:08:58] one mediator between god and man and
[1:09:00] that's the man not the woman right the
[1:09:02] man christ
[1:09:04] mel
[1:09:08] and so we see here that every son and
[1:09:11] daughter
[1:09:14] has the privilege of entering in
[1:09:17] to
[1:09:18] the veil amen what a glorious
[1:09:20] realization
[1:09:23] into the sacred presence of god where
[1:09:26] the mercy seat is we're the cherubims
[1:09:29] amen
[1:09:32] wings tipped coming together there
[1:09:35] presence of god
[1:09:37] and the mercy seat see
[1:09:39] actually as someone put it you know we
[1:09:42] actually become the mercies right you
[1:09:44] listen to the message about the
[1:09:46] throne right uh
[1:09:48] 144 000 and so on and so forth
[1:09:51] and we see then that
[1:09:54] here god has
[1:09:56] called us to this position he's made us
[1:09:59] to be this
[1:10:02] now they said to the lord jesus if thou
[1:10:04] be the son of god come down off the
[1:10:06] cross
[1:10:08] if thou be
[1:10:10] now he didn't make himself right what he
[1:10:13] was
[1:10:14] he just recognized who he was right who
[1:10:16] he was right what his position was right
[1:10:18] right brother branham said that jesus
[1:10:21] had to search the scriptures
[1:10:23] to find his place right amen
[1:10:26] if the bridegroom had to search the
[1:10:28] scriptures to find his place
[1:10:31] what about the groom right or what about
[1:10:33] the bride amen right if the groom had to
[1:10:36] what about us exactly
[1:10:40] what was christ
[1:10:41] it was god actually limiting himself
[1:10:44] even though he was in the fullness of
[1:10:45] god
[1:10:47] he was limited in knowledge right
[1:10:49] imagine
[1:10:50] jesus didn't even know the day in the
[1:10:51] hour while he was here right he said
[1:10:53] not even the son of man knows these
[1:10:55] things right well he was here he did is
[1:10:57] that right right maybe it had been
[1:10:59] revealed to you
[1:11:00] all right so we then must realize that
[1:11:03] we're here on the same order with
[1:11:05] limited
[1:11:06] knowledge right that's why you got to
[1:11:08] have faith in that body be it's not how
[1:11:11] much knowledge you have lead not to your
[1:11:13] own understanding right only believe
[1:11:15] only believe that's what we're called to
[1:11:17] do is believe right
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:21] and uh
[1:11:26] as i said before you don't understand in
[1:11:28] order to believe you believe in order to
[1:11:29] understand that's right
[1:11:31] and then god will give you the
[1:11:32] revelation understanding as
[1:11:34] as we believe as you believe amen
[1:11:37] now
[1:11:42] now that is true god called messiahs
[1:11:45] god called us we become kings and
[1:11:47] priests unto god

[1:15:56] james stop to think
[1:15:57] if the lord jesus
[1:16:00] uh you let's just say you
[1:16:02] instead of me saying
[1:16:04] had you been there 2 000 years ago
[1:16:07] um
[1:16:08] and
[1:16:09] you would want the lord to pray for it
[1:16:12] or maybe we could say it like this if he
[1:16:14] was here today
[1:16:16] and you would ask him to pray for you on
[1:16:19] a certain need
[1:16:21] certain requests
[1:16:24] do you think that god could turn that
[1:16:26] prayer down if jesus asked for it for
[1:16:28] you

[1:16:36] right do you think god could turn him
[1:16:38] down

[1:16:47] when you pray in jesus name
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:51] god doesn't see you he only
[1:16:53] sees the blood right right he hears your
[1:16:55] voice that's right but he sees the blood
[1:16:57] of the lord jesus amen

[1:17:30] it for you
[1:17:31] uh
[1:17:33] um
[1:17:35] is
[1:17:36] the government voice that isaiah says

[1:17:43] aware
[1:17:44] and the shoulders is where right part of
[1:17:46] the body right right right amen and the
[1:17:50] shoulders then

[1:17:56] strength we're
[1:17:58] we as kings and priests carry out right
[1:18:02] see right his orders yes and we
[1:18:05] help fulfill see
[1:18:08] in his dominion even that were the
[1:18:10] promise
[1:18:11] of the over to the overcomer of this age
[1:18:14] he that overcometh will i grant to sit

[1:18:21] uh even as i am overcome adam sat down
[1:18:24] with the father in his dominion
[1:18:27] throne is dominion
[1:18:30] and this dominion stretches from
[1:18:32] eternity to eternity right amen riches
[1:18:34] it's over the household of faith
[1:18:36] it's over the whole realm of the
[1:18:39] family of god right amen
[1:18:42] do you ever think now what the sweetest
[1:18:43] sound on the human ear is
[1:18:47] brother brandon said we're told it the
[1:18:49] scientists and so forth tell us the
[1:18:50] swedish sound on the human ear
[1:18:52] is the sound of your own name that's
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:56] and uh
[1:18:57] then we rightfully sing that song jesus
[1:19:00] it's the sweetest thing i know right
[1:19:02] why because it's the name of whom the
[1:19:05] whole family right both in heaven and
[1:19:08] earth and state
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:10] so who is it
[1:19:13] all right
[1:19:14] yeah stop and realize right he made us
[1:19:18] that right right
[1:19:19] if he oh my god
[1:19:22] you know
[1:19:23] there's um
[1:19:25] uh 14 generations and 14 generations
[1:19:29] and 14 generations
[1:19:32] um
[1:19:33] to christ
[1:19:35] right three groups of 14 right right you
[1:19:37] know i believe that's in matthew isn't
[1:19:39] it if i'm not mistaken let's see if we
[1:19:41] can find that right quick
[1:19:42] um just uh
[1:19:44] simple enough to
[1:19:46] try to even though i didn't have that in
[1:19:49] let's just check that out i believe
[1:19:51] that's in the first part of matthew if
[1:19:52] i'm not mistaken you bible students can
[1:19:55] help me
[1:19:58] chapter 1 of matthew 17.
[1:20:01] thank you thank you very much
[1:20:08] let's see here now
[1:20:11] uh
[1:20:12] so all the generations from abraham to
[1:20:15] david are 14 generations
[1:20:18] now abraham's the father of faith that's
[1:20:20] the beginning of the faith scene
[1:20:23] so all the generations
[1:20:25] from abraham to david are 14 generations
[1:20:29] and from david unto the carrying away
[1:20:31] into babylon
[1:20:32] are 14 generations
[1:20:35] and from the carrying away
[1:20:37] into babylon unto christ are 14
[1:20:40] generations
[1:20:42] now
[1:20:43] three sets of 14 would be six sevens
[1:20:49] is that right
[1:20:50] right
[1:20:52] six sevens
[1:20:57] and uh
[1:20:58] when we
[1:21:01] look now
[1:21:03] it's
[1:21:04] it's not complete you got the six number
[1:21:06] six there right it takes the seven to be
[1:21:08] complete right right just like there was
[1:21:10] six seals but then he was the seventh
[1:21:13] right amen uh there were six water pots
[1:21:16] yeah yeah but christ
[1:21:18] was the one who turned the water into
[1:21:19] white he was the seventh right and in
[1:21:21] john 7 37 he said come unto me oh you
[1:21:24] the thirst
[1:21:26] you know and so forth
[1:21:28] and this he speak of the holy ghost uh
[1:21:31] which should act would be given right
[1:21:33] see by the church
[1:21:35] because he was not yet glorified right
[1:21:37] so it was imparted to the church to be
[1:21:40] the one who really parked this life
[1:21:41] right see that the greater greater works
[1:21:44] that's right all right now
[1:21:47] then we see that
[1:21:50] um
[1:21:51] where is his seventh coming in like the
[1:21:53] woman at the well she had six husbands
[1:21:56] or she had five and one she's with
[1:21:57] number six wasn't her husband but here
[1:21:59] come the sevens right christ the true
[1:22:02] husband yeah and we see them also we see
[1:22:04] the same thing in type here in um
[1:22:08] uh ruth
[1:22:09] because boaz the kinsman redeemer only
[1:22:12] gave her six measures
[1:22:15] is that right right six measures
[1:22:18] of barley
[1:22:19] and that barley can be eaten or it could
[1:22:21] be used for seed right but see that was
[1:22:25] a natural seed
[1:22:27] but it only spoke of something he was
[1:22:30] going to do and that's why naomi said
[1:22:33] rest yeah right yep
[1:22:38] boaz
[1:22:40] himself gave her seed right
[1:22:44] to bring forth even christ right right
[1:22:49] sure right oh man jesse
[1:22:53] part of this genealogy right
[1:22:55] speaking of the seed of life amen all
[1:22:57] right now so we see six here
[1:23:01] generations but here comes christ all
[1:23:03] right so until we got so and so we
[1:23:15] isaiah 52 said he was cut off who shall
[1:23:18] declare his generation amen
[1:23:24] the bride
[1:23:26] is the continuation of the new creation
[1:23:29] seven church ages comes out now rightly
[1:23:32] there's another seven right seven
[1:23:35] generations right from every church age
[1:23:38] comes forth those faces of christ
[1:23:41] they'll see gene of christ
[1:23:44] the bride will be called out of seven
[1:23:45] ages what is she

[1:24:14] god made adam and he made eve at the
[1:24:16] same time
[1:24:17] if he was the beginning of the creation
[1:24:20] then she the bride the church has to be
[1:24:22] the continuation of the same new
[1:24:25] creation right amen amen
[1:24:28] oh if we can only see what god hath made

[1:33:55] do nothing right exactly you won't never

[1:35:15] amnesia yeah right
[1:35:18] you know when we is born here in this
[1:35:21] dominion in sin shaped in iniquity come
[1:35:24] in the world speaking lies yes the
[1:35:26] nature of the world on us in the message

[1:35:30] received the nature uh of on your spirit
[1:35:33] which was that a worldly nature your
[1:35:35] soul yeah

[1:35:38] he said now it was permitted of god
[1:35:41] didn't come from god he said if it's
[1:35:43] permitted to god okay god didn't give
[1:35:45] nobody something worldly right but all
[1:35:47] life comes from god remember to the fact
[1:35:50] we was born in sin we had a worldly
[1:35:51] nature on our spirit right exactly and
[1:35:53] that nature has to die right now that's
[1:35:56] the old husband yeah
[1:35:58] there is where the new birth comes in
[1:36:00] right
[1:36:01] right there is where the new birth comes
[1:36:02] there and what's god begin to do when
[1:36:04] that happens he starts
[1:36:06] amen shocking you back into reality

[1:36:27] and he's here to tell you right
[1:36:29] now it looks like a contradiction but
[1:36:31] you've got to believe the word okay
[1:36:33] right got to believe the word where it
[1:36:35] looks like a contradiction that's where
[1:36:36] the revelation lays right let me play
[1:36:39] the part of the devil's advocacy here
[1:36:40] just a minute before i close
[1:36:44] say you're a message believer huh you

[1:36:54] the message
[1:36:55] you say you believe the tapes i can show
[1:36:57] you where he said you never sinned in

[1:37:28] now you believers
[1:37:30] never

[1:37:33] born of the spirit of god
[1:37:35] you never sinned in the first place
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:37] now what what could that be
[1:37:39] that's only god speaking via of his
[1:37:43] vindicated prophet messenger from the
[1:37:45] sea of god's forgetfulness right yeah

[1:38:42] worry now there's no worry in faith
[1:38:45] right well i wonder if i'm christian i
[1:38:47] wonder
[1:38:49] i wonder if i'll ever make it wrong i
[1:38:50] wonder if i can make a commercial i want
[1:38:52] to bring up the holy ghost no wonder i
[1:38:53] wonder that's just a watering star
[1:38:56] right but there's a way you can know
[1:38:58] right
[1:38:59] there is a confirmation and a
[1:39:01] vindication of what the holy ghost is
[1:39:03] right there's some evidence in the holy
[1:39:04] ghost right
[1:39:06] it's the same as it was never church
[1:39:07] 18th and you're living here right
[1:39:10] that's the word it's the abilities in
[1:39:12] the hearing not in the speaking and the
[1:39:14] hearing all right i am blessed are your
[1:39:16] ears amen hallelujah the evidence the
[1:39:19] holy ghost is the same today as it was
[1:39:20] in every church
[1:39:22] all right
[1:39:23] can you hear the word can you believe
[1:39:25] the word yeah see say amen to the words
[1:39:28] can i do it all right you're having this
[1:39:30] the holy ghost i showed you his sheep
[1:39:32] right do you know the baptism the holy
[1:39:34] ghost he said in one place a temporal
[1:39:35] gift sure right
[1:39:37] he said the real gift is that seed gene
[1:39:39] down in your soul
[1:39:41] what about that one
[1:39:43] that is a good one
[1:39:44] you could have the holy ghost every day
[1:39:46] your life but if you ain't predestined
[1:39:47] to see gene down your soul didn't come
[1:39:49] from god you can't go back to god
[1:39:51] judas had the same anointing that was on
[1:39:53] paul's right david and psalms i believe
[1:39:56] over there said let his bishop be given
[1:39:58] to another yeah right
[1:40:00] that was the bishoprican office that
[1:40:01] judas was called to was given to paul
[1:40:04] same holy ghost anointing
[1:40:07] but on judas
[1:40:08] it be not denied and crucified the word
[1:40:11] on paul it brought the gospel to the
[1:40:13] gentiles
[1:40:14] wrote most of the new testament right
[1:40:16] confirmed the word
[1:40:18] is that right that's right oh my
[1:40:20] something god had made right see and
[1:40:23] he's here
[1:40:25] to
[1:40:26] give to us
[1:40:28] his own
[1:40:29] mind his own
[1:40:30] word his own faith amen he is here to
[1:40:34] tell us what he hath made us reveal to
[1:40:36] us
[1:40:38] what
[1:40:38] actually
[1:40:39] uh he ordained us to be from before the
[1:40:42] foundational world
[1:40:44] to reveal to us our origin to reveal to
[1:40:46] us our destiny
[1:40:48] to reveal to us our true identity
[1:40:51] exactly what is the symptoms of amnesia
[1:40:54] people forget who they are amen what
[1:40:56] their name is right forget where they
[1:40:59] come from they don't know their address
[1:41:00] their phone number
[1:41:03] amen they're origin right they're
[1:41:06] pedigrees
[1:41:07] yeah
[1:41:08] but when
[1:41:10] one of the cures you remember brother
[1:41:12] branham showing us one of the cures for
[1:41:14] amnesia
[1:41:17] i think it's
[1:41:18] i don't remember this after world war i
[1:41:21] wonder world war ii i think it's
[1:41:22] probably world war ii but they had these
[1:41:24] soldiers i think they
[1:41:26] might have been some of the french
[1:41:27] soldiers uh for the merlot
[1:41:30] but he's talking about how that they
[1:41:32] they had amnesia
[1:41:34] and they didn't have no identity no dog
[1:41:35] tag or anything so they didn't know
[1:41:37] where they come from they didn't know
[1:41:38] what to do with them because they were
[1:41:41] they were they were healthy right
[1:41:43] but they had amnesia
[1:41:46] they could eat
[1:41:48] they could work you know they were
[1:41:50] healthy but they didn't know who they
[1:41:52] were right
[1:41:55] and so therefore there was kind of like
[1:41:57] a
[1:41:58] you know instead of really being an
[1:41:59] asset there was a liability
[1:42:02] you can be healthy
[1:42:04] yeah you can be strong yeah but you're
[1:42:06] still a liability
[1:42:08] and not an asset to the kingdom of god
[1:42:10] unless you know where you come from
[1:42:12] where you're going who you are
[1:42:15] and what your power and what your
[1:42:16] authority is and what your position is
[1:42:18] amen right
[1:42:22] but they put them on the train and was
[1:42:24] taking this sanatorium somewhere
[1:42:27] you know and this trains
[1:42:29] predestinated that god stopped at the
[1:42:31] right place
[1:42:32] and they let some of the soldiers get
[1:42:34] off and rest themselves stretch
[1:42:35] themselves a little bit on the old train
[1:42:38] and maybe the train stretched back out
[1:42:39] into the suburbs of the little community
[1:42:42] where it stopped for a whistle stop
[1:42:44] and so the soldiers let the or the
[1:42:46] guards let the soldiers get off and look
[1:42:47] around a little bit and one of these old
[1:42:49] one of these soldiers with amnesia
[1:42:51] started acting a little strange so the
[1:42:53] guard watched him and he he found a
[1:42:55] little pathway in he he got on this path
[1:42:58] over the railroad tracks a little up
[1:43:00] there in the
[1:43:01] terrain and he said well we got you know
[1:43:03] a few minutes i will just follow him see
[1:43:05] what he does
[1:43:07] and uh so the guard was watching this
[1:43:09] soldier
[1:43:10] and he went over the hill
[1:43:12] and he stayed back distance watching him
[1:43:14] from behind you know and then he sees a
[1:43:16] little house over in front of the
[1:43:18] soldier and in front of this house on
[1:43:20] the porch was an old man sitting sitting
[1:43:22] a a rocking chair rocky
[1:43:24] and uh the old man
[1:43:26] began to raise up as he sees this
[1:43:28] soldier coming
[1:43:30] you know toward the house this man
[1:43:32] coming toward the house
[1:43:33] and so
[1:43:34] as he raised up
[1:43:36] and it's the uh this
[1:43:39] man with amnesia seen him
[1:43:42] and uh his father comrade to meet him
[1:43:45] and he said oh my son my son oh
[1:43:48] hallelujah glory to god my
[1:43:50] son and he said daddy daddy daddy
[1:43:56] the train had stopped to the right place
[1:43:59] he had found an old familiar pathway
[1:44:02] amen
[1:44:03] hallelujah
[1:44:05] the old gospel track he said amen
[1:44:08] and
[1:44:09] then his amnesia left him right
[1:44:13] would the god dark amnesia would lead us
[1:44:15] right amen amen father's business come
[1:44:18] home

[1:44:37] life and that's joey if you're ever
[1:44:39] going to have eternal life it's his life

[2:04:00] uh she's received the word of the lord
[2:04:02] that went forth tonight
[2:04:04] she
[2:04:06] don't want to be a
[2:04:08] asset
[2:04:09] or a liability but an asset something
[2:04:12] that's needful right she wants to be an
[2:04:14] asset and not a liability is what she
[2:04:16] said
[2:04:17] and uh how many i that's what i yeah
[2:04:24] if the government's on your shoulders
[2:04:26] that's the strongest part of your body
[2:04:27] right and we don't want to let the
[2:04:29] government of god down is right right
[2:04:30] yeah exactly and so
[2:04:32] in this dominion now we've got to take
[2:04:34] that authority
[2:04:36] and our sister wants to be a real asset
[2:04:38] and not a liability from this day
[2:04:40] forward
[2:04:41] and uh let's all agree not only for
[2:04:43] ourselves but for her that god will
[2:04:45] grant us that ability
[2:04:46] to do that right amen whatever the holy
[2:04:49] spirit speaks to your heart about we go
[2:04:51] forward i appreciate her boldness amen
[2:04:53] all right openness
[2:04:55] to desire that that's exactly what the
[2:04:57] holy spirit has called us for right
[2:04:59] right
[2:05:00] that's right so let's pray together with
[2:05:01] her and for different ones that have
[2:05:03] raised your hand to do the same thing
[2:05:08] and we're agreeing together with her now
[2:05:11] lord jesus that we will just be led by
[2:05:15] the holy spirit that will be sensitive
[2:05:18] that will be
[2:05:31] manifest in the apostolic order
[2:05:34] lord as
[2:05:35] there was prophets and prophecies lord
[2:05:38] and these powers of god are not limited
[2:05:42] just to the man but to the women
[2:05:44] heavenly father
[2:05:45] and lord we pray you'll anoint her dear
[2:05:48] god we remember even stephen's uh or
[2:05:51] philip's daughters that prophesied and
[2:05:53] so forth and lord we know there's a
[2:05:55] place in the kingdom of god not that
[2:05:57] we're here to
[2:05:58] try to emphasize the gifts lord but
[2:06:01] we're here to magnify the giver oh
[2:06:04] knowing that your presence and all of
[2:06:05] the emphasis should be placed upon you
[2:06:08] but father you've made us something and
[2:06:11] we want to
[2:06:12] recognize what you've made us so that we
[2:06:14] can take authority now
[2:06:16] and be a real asset not only to
[2:06:18] ourselves not only for our families but
[2:06:21] lord for the entire kingdom of god as
[2:06:23] one individual represents the entire
[2:06:25] body of christ the entire church of
[2:06:28] christ help us now master
[2:06:30] encourage my sister
[2:06:32] give her strength from this day forward
[2:06:35] to be a real asset to the kingdom of god
[2:06:38] sensitive led by the spirit yes granted
[2:06:41] in jesus name each one of us
[2:06:47] anybody else
[2:06:50] though
[2:06:52] let's just believe him
[2:07:12] okay
[2:07:26] anybody else who'd like to come
[2:07:28] just be praying
[2:07:35] yes
[2:07:52] you know
[2:07:57] yes
[2:08:26] amen
[2:08:28] i think it'd be good one more time for
[2:08:30] our sister the elders would come
[2:08:32] uh it is a form of sickness
[2:08:36] and affliction
[2:08:38] and
[2:08:39] i think
[2:08:40] this the doctors call it insomnia
[2:08:44] insomnia
[2:08:47] she can't sleep
[2:08:49] she still wants to come to church though
[2:08:51] amen that's good she's fighting her way
[2:08:54] and uh
[2:08:56] but
[2:08:58] the devil would love for her to come to
[2:08:59] churches to go to sleep in church
[2:09:02] but
[2:09:03] the lord is here i believe with all my
[2:09:05] heart to touch her and give her
[2:09:08] her heart's desire
[2:09:10] she's not giving up
[2:09:12] amen
[2:09:13] and uh so let's believe with her now if
[2:09:16] there's anything see that would hinder
[2:09:19] this healing this deliverance
[2:09:22] may the lord reveal it
[2:09:24] and to her individually and that we
[2:09:27] should be able to get that out of the
[2:09:29] way
[2:09:30] that she could receive there's no
[2:09:32] lacking on god's part amen
[2:09:35] god his promises are gay and amen
[2:09:38] there's no failure on his part
[2:09:41] and so if there's any shortcomings it
[2:09:43] would be something and if there is
[2:09:45] anything now that we've
[2:09:47] she's been praying for several times she
[2:09:48] expressed
[2:09:50] and uh so
[2:09:51] uh if there is something let's pray god
[2:09:54] reveal it
[2:09:56] to her that's right and then she can get
[2:09:58] it out of the way and receive her
[2:10:00] healing
[2:10:02] and uh so
[2:10:04] uh we're not here to try to discern her
[2:10:06] thoughts in the intents of her heart or
[2:10:08] anything but the holy spirit knows what
[2:10:10] it is glory and he's able to minister
[2:10:13] and reveal anything that would hinder
[2:10:15] amen right
[2:10:16] so let's pray now for her as we lay her
[2:10:18] hands up our hands upon her
[2:10:22] and i annoyed her with oil amen lord
[2:10:25] jesus
[2:10:54] and restored
[2:11:22] whatever
[2:11:33] amen anybody
[2:11:35] else thank you
[2:11:50] amen amen amen we believe
[2:11:54] we thank god for the truth yes enjoy the
[2:11:56] message today amen our brother being

[2:12:26] holler this is my head all you won't
[2:12:27] talk about
[2:12:28] but if it's not revealed amen that's
[2:12:30] right not a head that's right it's a
[2:12:32] good knowledge right
