[5:41] sore bottoms
[5:43] yeah
[5:45] we sit four hours in the morning four
[5:47] hours needing
[5:49] four days and a
[5:50] half don't worry yeah but
[5:53] it was a good time
[5:55] amen just remember now the lord willing
[5:57] wait we'll be preaching the evening
[5:58] service to be much in prayer for him
[6:01] lord to be with us got a lot of requests
[6:03] to be given
[6:05] and uh sister is it jeannette
[6:08] of it brother richard wilson's her
[6:10] husband passed away
[6:12] um yesterday i think it was so remember
[6:15] the family there
[6:16] you know and then remember to keep
[6:18] praying for brother holbert arnold we
[6:20] have him on the prayer list but remember
[6:22] to keep praying for him about his
[6:23] eyesight they're going to start putting
[6:25] some
[6:26] shots into his eye to see and get that
[6:29] if it'll happen so just remember that
[6:31] and also brother richard wilson now will
[6:33] be having some work done on his apostate
[6:36] having it shaved on i guess of what you
[6:38] call it shaving it on
[6:42] friday so remember that keep him in your
[6:44] prayers the lord will bless all right
[6:46] brother hal thomas uh had to have some
[6:49] stents placed in his heart and some
[6:51] other worked on it but he's doing fine
[6:53] so you know just keep praying for him i
[6:56] think that's about all of the the ones
[6:58] that we
[7:00] remember but just let the lord have his
[7:03] way all right
[7:05] john 3
[7:08] be very familiar scripture with
[7:10] everybody
[7:11] and we will be speaking on this for
[7:14] two or three services i don't know
[7:15] exactly how much
[7:17] that we'll go
[7:18] but um
[7:20] we're going to try to just do more
[7:22] preaching if we can
[7:24] on a lot of it than to do as much as we
[7:26] call it teaching
[7:28] and try to to get a point across
[7:30] because um you know it was laid a burden
[7:33] on weight heart to get a a list of
[7:36] prayers you know
[7:38] people put on the prayer list
[7:39] for salvation
[7:41] and uh you know there's a lot placed on
[7:43] there and then you know the families if
[7:45] you want your family put on there you
[7:47] want your children
[7:48] husband wife etc whatever father mother
[7:52] uh placed on that list then do it and
[7:55] he will have a list and then that way
[7:56] you can just you don't have to have the
[7:58] list you can always use the way i do i
[8:00] just say lord you remember the list
[8:03] well he can't forget the list so we
[8:05] don't have to worry about calling all
[8:06] the names but
[8:08] you know just pray that the lord would
[8:10] do that so i thought would it just be a
[8:11] good time to
[8:13] i had announced maybe that i would be
[8:15] speaking on some like doctrinal issues
[8:17] of the message
[8:19] uh why i don't agree with them on what i
[8:21] do believe etc
[8:22] and but we'll get to that but we'll take
[8:25] two or three services maybe a couple
[8:27] on this about what is the new birth amen
[8:30] you know some of you are concerned
[8:32] whether or not you have the new birth
[8:33] and that's wonderful
[8:35] i can think that's a great thing is to
[8:37] be because those that hunger and thirst
[8:39] after righteousness
[8:41] shall be filled so i believe that so you
[8:43] just listen and if you're doing and i
[8:46] know what satan generally does by the
[8:48] time i announce something ahead that's
[8:49] going to be helpful here then a lot of
[8:52] you
[8:53] go somewhere else to church for
[8:55] services or whatever you do and you
[8:57] generally miss it but please listen to
[8:58] the tape right and we're going to take
[9:00] this opportunity to speak on what is
[9:04] the new birth okay john 3
[9:07] father we thank you we love you and we
[9:09] ask you to just bless us with your
[9:10] presence now that this day
[9:12] forgive our sins because we want to be
[9:14] covered by the blood
[9:16] and just keep us and bless each and
[9:18] every one all of these that the nines
[9:19] were called the ones that were requested
[9:22] the prayer
[9:24] that you'll be with each one this one
[9:25] that's lost her husband just be a
[9:28] comfort unto her lord be with brother
[9:30] arnold everybody's high lord and restore
[9:32] it back unto it
[9:33] and these all the requests that were
[9:35] given thank you for being with brother
[9:36] how lord he didn't have to have the
[9:38] major surgery that they were wondering
[9:41] about but yet we know you come on the
[9:43] scene and take care of all times we love
[9:45] you and we thank you and we ask you to
[9:47] just come down speak to our hearts as we
[9:50] talk about you
[9:51] in jesus name
[9:53] amen
[9:54] john 3 very familiar scripture with all
[9:56] of us
[9:58] right
[9:59] there was a man of the pharisees named
[10:00] nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same
[10:02] came to jesus by night and said unto him
[10:05] rabbi we know that that thou art a
[10:08] teacher that really is the teacher he
[10:11] was the king teacher he was the great of
[10:12] all right
[10:14] we know that thou art a teacher come
[10:15] from god for no man can do these
[10:18] miracles that thou doest except god be
[10:21] with him what a testimony
[10:23] jesus answered and said unto him verily
[10:25] verily i say unto you
[10:28] except a man be born again he cannot see
[10:30] the kingdom of god
[10:32] nicodemus says unto him count can a man
[10:34] be born when he is old
[10:37] can he enter the second time into his
[10:38] mother's womb and be born
[10:40] jesus answered
[10:42] verily verily i say unto thee except a
[10:45] man be born of water and of the spirit
[10:48] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[10:51] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[10:53] and that which is born of the spirit is
[10:54] spirit
[10:56] marvel not that i said unto
[10:58] thee you must be born again you may be
[11:01] seated the lord have his
[11:03] blessing to the reading of the word
[11:05] now i emphasize and always do because
[11:08] brother brown
[11:09] said that
[11:12] actually nicodemus
[11:15] and i believe it's schamelia and he said
[11:17] would be
[11:18] given eternal life
[11:20] because of their stand right well you
[11:23] know this nicodemus here he said that we
[11:25] know we we not just die and he was
[11:28] called and if you look in the original
[11:30] there you'll see that it says
[11:32] the teacher
[11:34] now in verse 10 where he repeats it thy
[11:36] art a teacher the original says
[11:39] the teacher in other words he was the
[11:41] top man everybody wanted to go to him
[11:44] he would be the top college
[11:46] uh professor today or whatever you would
[11:48] want to call it
[11:50] and uh but everybody wanted to listen to
[11:52] it and he said we we
[11:54] know that no man can do the things that
[11:57] you're doing except god be with him
[12:00] amen so we're just concerned about it
[12:02] i'd like to sit down and talk with you
[12:04] in other words amen all right first
[12:06] thing he said though to him he said nick
[12:08] of
[12:09] about his ranking and told him all the
[12:11] things
[12:13] but he said you must be born again amen
[12:16] well to a man that was highly educated
[12:19] and i'm talking about bible educated i'm
[12:21] talking about uh worldly knowledge of
[12:24] everything
[12:25] uh he knew what the scroll said he knew
[12:28] what the things were said he must have
[12:30] been an honest man in his heart because
[12:33] he wasn't like the other
[12:34] uh you know pharisees sadducees that was
[12:37] wanting to kill jesus because of of who
[12:40] he was and what he was doing
[12:42] he was he gave him a great honor
[12:44] all right in doing that but jesus turned
[12:47] to him he said nicodemus you must be
[12:49] born again
[12:51] all right we good badness you know
[12:53] that's where it came from so the reason
[12:54] i say that
[12:56] we should pour on nicodemus all he had
[12:58] to do is believe
[12:59] well that's a good point
[13:01] but he must have been a pretty good
[13:03] believer
[13:11] to jesus and talk to him all right but
[13:13] still
[13:14] you know i used to try to discuss it
[13:16] with him right with him right before i
[13:18] left the bad just you really about the
[13:20] time i began to hear about the message i
[13:22] could read the scriptures that don't say
[13:24] he that believes he said he didn't
[13:25] believe it
[13:26] and i've questioned that point with him
[13:28] well why does it say believe it right so
[13:30] that means continue on amen you don't
[13:32] have the bad disbelief if you just
[13:34] believe it that's it
[13:35] you're you're going to be there well
[13:38] why is it that a lot are not going to be
[13:40] there right but
[13:41] you know that's derby is that's not ours
[13:44] but what i want to do is just
[13:46] talk jesus i said about
[13:49] salvation
[13:51] and do you that
[13:52] you know that are not really
[13:54] set in the basis of your salvation of
[13:57] maybe
[13:58] believing you're born again then i ask
[14:01] you to please just listen and then write
[14:03] down comments questions etc something
[14:06] that i need to emphasize a little more
[14:09] and you know we'll try to to do that
[14:12] and you know
[14:14] most everybody says well what do you
[14:15] mean brother dale i'm born again i'm in
[14:17] the message
[14:19] well nicodemus was in the message
[14:23] right
[14:25] he was in the message of the day that's
[14:27] right
[14:28] and he saw new light
[14:30] and he stepped up into the light right
[14:32] you know enough to
[14:34] talk about it right so he must have been
[14:36] a pretty good believer
[14:38] but still that
[14:40] when it was said to him his natural man
[14:43] could not comprehend right
[14:46] right of all his
[14:48] uh education and his abilities and god
[14:51] working with him and doing with him and
[14:54] you know like that
[14:56] he said
[14:57] you you mean i've got to go back to my
[14:58] mother's womb
[15:02] he just couldn't comprehend
[15:05] and jesus tried to explain it to him
[15:08] but yet how could he explain entering
[15:11] the thing that
[15:14] he had come to make a way to do and to
[15:17] make manifest
[15:19] when they believed that
[15:21] staying in that letter of the law
[15:24] that that was what saved them
[15:26] the great apostle paul
[15:29] you know we emphasized that a lot he
[15:31] said
[15:32] you know
[15:34] concerning the law blameless
[15:38] but he said i found
[15:41] what i thought was life
[15:44] he said i found it to be dead
[15:50] and
[15:51] to him see it was keeping the law to the
[15:54] letter
[15:56] and that's what nicodemus that's all he
[15:57] could comprehend
[15:59] was keeping the letter of the law doing
[16:01] what god says
[16:02] being good now i've always emphasized to
[16:05] you but i like to do that that
[16:09] you know these are not just common
[16:10] ordinary people you're talking about
[16:12] that just well i go to church every once
[16:14] in a while when i walk to and and i
[16:15] believe in god oh yeah great jehovah
[16:18] these were people that almost born
[16:20] raised and that's right and spent their
[16:22] entire life into
[16:24] the tabernacle that's right
[16:27] living for god
[16:29] but yet
[16:30] how can you understand the new birth
[16:34] come on right
[16:37] so mankind has spent thousands of years
[16:40] now too almost or a little over
[16:43] trying to explain what jesus was talking
[16:45] about
[16:47] and you find in the message of the hour
[16:50] moving on up to where we're at
[16:52] that you find the good old baptist
[16:55] and they say well i believe the message
[16:58] you know i believe everything the
[16:59] prophet said
[17:01] and you find good old methodists you
[17:03] know that say well i was sanctified my
[17:07] my life changed and
[17:09] things are different now
[17:12] you know then you find good pentecostals
[17:14] that
[17:15] you know when i spoke in tongues i've
[17:18] shouted i've done all the things
[17:21] and i know i'm saved
[17:25] well i wonder what would happen if the
[17:27] lord jesus
[17:28] sat down and talked with you and i
[17:30] personally and brought us to a
[17:33] consciousness now get the situation
[17:36] a consciousness of our own lives and our
[17:39] own being and our own
[17:41] doings
[17:42] and bring us to that position
[17:45] like he did nicodemus that was sitting
[17:47] there that understood all of the
[17:49] scriptures right
[17:52] him
[17:54] say
[17:55] you must be born again
[17:59] i wonder what we would quote back
[18:02] to him
[18:05] as i said i shouted i believe i spoke in
[18:07] tongues i believe the message
[18:10] what would be our answers back to the
[18:12] lord jesus
[18:13] in that situation
[18:16] and then we come up to the super duper
[18:18] faith type of people that
[18:20] you run into that
[18:22] they'll actually even say it to you you
[18:24] can't tell me i ain't saved
[18:30] and then they'll give you some reason
[18:34] for that you know
[18:36] i've done this didn't do that i do that
[18:38] whatever they bring a reasoning into it
[18:42] to try to prove that they are born again
[18:45] well i don't believe you have to prove
[18:46] you're born again that's right right
[18:49] i never have tried to to preach or
[18:51] believe that you had to prove your
[18:52] salvation
[18:54] i believe your salvation will prove you
[18:58] you know
[18:59] i i think it'll make manifest in our
[19:02] lives and and and will prove us to be
[19:04] what we are
[19:05] unto to that point but now
[19:09] just think about it
[19:11] what is the new birth
[19:16] all right now we're up in this age where
[19:18] that we
[19:19] supposed to be climbing the prophet's
[19:21] message you know i believe what he says
[19:24] and we're in the age now that there was
[19:26] a time that like the prophet would say
[19:29] that in the days of luther to just
[19:31] believe god you were saved
[19:35] he said then it moved on to deeper
[19:37] depths to where that it would come
[19:39] through the mess of this period of
[19:40] sanctification
[19:43] and he's called that the new birth of
[19:44] the rages and times which he was
[19:47] all right
[19:49] and
[19:50] then he come to the pentecostals
[19:53] and he'd say now that was good but he'd
[19:55] say it like this he said a lot of people
[19:58] believed and had the holy ghost he said
[20:00] a lot of people believed and didn't have
[20:02] it right that's right he said a lot of
[20:04] people shouted and had the holy ghost he
[20:05] said a lot of people shouted and didn't
[20:07] have it he said a lot of people spoke in
[20:10] tongues and gifts and
[20:11] had the holy ghost and a lot of them
[20:13] didn't have it
[20:14] all right
[20:15] now my point has always been to
[20:19] say why
[20:22] why didn't they believe it
[20:25] when even
[20:27] the bible says that
[20:29] jesus was seen of as many as 500
[20:31] brethren after his resurrection
[20:35] seen after he raised
[20:38] witnessed him as to be the messiah that
[20:41] rushed amen right
[20:44] but yet
[20:45] when it came to the upper room
[20:46] experience there was only 120. that's
[20:49] right
[20:51] what happened to the 380 right
[20:54] see my point is to try to get across
[20:57] something that
[20:59] you know
[21:00] to get us away from what we're looking
[21:02] at is our salvation to see if what we're
[21:05] looking at is our salvation is word
[21:08] oriented or based upon the bible
[21:11] amen
[21:11] all right
[21:12] you say well i've seen visions i've done
[21:14] this i've done that it's all wonderful
[21:19] but gifts and callings are without
[21:20] repentance that's right amen
[21:22] you don't have to be a christian to have
[21:24] gifts in your life that's right
[21:26] just don't save you
[21:29] all right
[21:30] going to church don't save you right
[21:32] right being good don't save you
[21:36] all right that is supposed to be
[21:39] an outward manifestation
[21:42] of what has happened on the inside of us
[21:45] right amen all right
[21:47] and i just finished the series there
[21:49] will be therefore perfect
[21:51] and um this kind of just ties in with it
[21:53] but we found in that that
[21:56] that you're not born again in your body
[21:59] you're not born again in your spirit
[22:01] part of you remember to reason conscious
[22:03] affection etc
[22:05] you're born again in the center part of
[22:07] you which is called the soul
[22:09] all right
[22:10] where brother branham would say that
[22:12] sense that that has only one sense it's
[22:14] either faith or doubt right it's not
[22:16] faith and doubt it's either faith or
[22:18] doubt because you're either born again
[22:20] or not now i don't want to get into the
[22:22] born-again experience as much
[22:24] on this message i want to just talk
[22:26] about justification
[22:30] because the prophet of god says in this
[22:32] day this reading is bringing it down
[22:34] see it's not and i'll emphasize that in
[22:36] a minute we believe in three stages of
[22:39] grace not three works
[22:42] we'll read that in a minute
[22:45] now
[22:46] it is not works
[22:50] so it's not three works of grace now
[22:52] you'll get right around even call it
[22:53] three words of christ but then you'll
[22:55] hear him explain it that it's not three
[22:57] works
[22:58] because none of it's works
[23:01] so it's three stages are
[23:03] manifestations
[23:05] amen
[23:06] of the same holy ghost he said the same
[23:09] holy ghost that justified the lutheran
[23:11] sanctified the methodists baptized the
[23:14] pentecostal that's 464 pretty sure in
[23:16] the steel book
[23:17] it's now settings either letter 251
[23:21] he said it's now sitting in order the
[23:22] coming of the lord
[23:24] it's the same holy ghost
[23:26] justification is a work of the holy
[23:28] spirit
[23:29] sanctification is a work of the holy
[23:32] spirit that's right but the baptism is
[23:34] the holy spirit amen so now we want to
[23:37] stay with that point see we'll read
[23:38] these in a minute
[23:40] all right
[23:41] but get my whole
[23:42] whole point of trying to get us to see
[23:47] how many of you remember when you first
[23:49] repented
[23:50] of your sins
[23:52] right amen
[23:54] now
[23:55] you can remember that you were going
[23:57] wrong and something happened
[24:00] and the bible says that
[24:03] the goodness of god
[24:05] is what leads us to repentance amen all
[24:08] right now we'll get back to this
[24:10] scripture in a minute but
[24:13] remember jesus said
[24:15] you can't come to me unless my father
[24:18] draws you
[24:21] all right
[24:22] now
[24:24] but make sure you understand
[24:27] if you're concerned about your salvation
[24:31] you know you're concerned about it
[24:33] you're not certain about it you don't
[24:34] know but you're wanting god to to reveal
[24:37] something to you remember then
[24:40] that
[24:42] god must be calling you right
[24:44] all right man all right
[24:47] see something working on you
[24:49] right right
[24:51] you remember when you know i've heard a
[24:53] lot of your testimonies
[24:54] you know
[24:55] that you know
[24:57] you just
[24:58] you have really no idea a lot of times
[25:01] that brother dean's there he's he he
[25:03] went to church with his
[25:05] sister or somebody had no
[25:07] thoughts about going for salvation he's
[25:09] probably going to show off his suit or
[25:10] his car
[25:11] and uh you know no point of of trying to
[25:15] be saved
[25:17] but then just something happens
[25:19] all right but i want to emphasize to you
[25:22] see you say but how do i know if god is
[25:24] calling me
[25:26] if there's something dealing with you it
[25:27] certainly is not the deal
[25:29] that's right
[25:30] all right
[25:31] so god is calling you now many are
[25:34] called
[25:36] but a few are chosen
[25:38] all right
[25:39] but see many are called in other words
[25:41] take that that's pulling up on you
[25:44] so i told you i wanted to preach instead
[25:45] of maybe teach so much on it
[25:48] is take that that's pulling up on your
[25:50] heart
[25:52] and count that to be god called again
[25:54] that's right count that to be the
[25:56] calling you know
[25:58] that god is calling you he's speaking to
[26:01] you
[26:02] all right
[26:03] and then you can move from that because
[26:05] the emphasis i want to make through the
[26:07] whole thing is one thing the prophet of
[26:10] god said everything we get from god must
[26:12] come by faith right right amen
[26:15] all right
[26:16] now let's don't make faith a great super
[26:19] duper whether that on up into the new
[26:21] birth a little okay just stay with me
[26:24] where i'm at
[26:26] we say well now of faith
[26:30] what sometimes faith is just simply
[26:32] believing right that's right
[26:34] because the bible said i believe it's in
[26:36] hebrews that works if
[26:38] he that cometh to god must believe that
[26:39] he is
[26:42] all right now that's what i've been
[26:44] you know kind of doing while i was
[26:46] sitting on the deer stands and
[26:48] taking my ipod and just
[26:51] two in the morning two in the evening
[26:53] just listening to tapes and just having
[26:55] a good time doing that because you're
[26:57] sitting in a box and doesn't matter how
[26:58] much racket hardly you make
[27:00] you know
[27:01] so uh
[27:03] but then i just stopped sometimes and
[27:05] just think
[27:08] you know that little statement
[27:11] that he that cometh to god
[27:14] must believe that he is right
[27:17] all right now let me show you and i'm
[27:20] trying to get you to a mental thought
[27:25] you know that history
[27:29] you know what i mean by history is
[27:30] records and things like that you know
[27:32] what i'm saying by history
[27:34] you know that history can prove that
[27:36] jesus christ existed
[27:41] they could prove
[27:45] that he lived
[27:48] they can prove that he was crucified
[27:51] that's right
[27:53] fine i mean you know history can prove
[27:55] it
[27:56] all right
[27:58] now does that save history
[28:04] you know
[28:06] because he that cometh to god must
[28:07] believe that he is
[28:11] not
[28:12] that he was right
[28:15] science can prove or our history can
[28:18] prove
[28:18] that he did exist
[28:22] prove that he died
[28:25] and even the records would go by to
[28:27] whether they probably wouldn't believe
[28:28] it a lot but they still got to admit
[28:31] something happened to him
[28:32] that he raised
[28:34] and then they got some more proof
[28:36] records that
[28:38] you know if
[28:39] that something happened to their
[28:40] disciples because they all claimed they
[28:42] believed him and claimed they seen him
[28:44] after his resurrections and different
[28:46] things you know
[28:47] and then the proof of it was to coming
[28:50] on the day of pentecost with the baptism
[28:51] with the holy ghost
[28:54] but get what i'm saying now see
[28:56] to believe that he was
[29:00] is is one thing that's good amen it's a
[29:02] background amen all right we can depend
[29:05] upon that
[29:08] but it's
[29:09] that won't save you amen that's right
[29:13] you got to believe that he is amen
[29:16] to be saved
[29:18] right now he is his present tense
[29:20] not past tense not two seconds ago
[29:23] he is his very present tense for
[29:25] eternity
[29:28] now in that then
[29:32] keep the thought
[29:34] it doesn't say
[29:36] he was
[29:38] it's always he is right man
[29:42] nicodemus didn't go up and talk to some
[29:44] of the disciples after the
[29:46] death of the lord jesus and
[29:49] and you know
[29:50] discuss things with them
[29:53] he was talking with the one that was
[29:55] there present
[29:57] right
[29:59] see now to be saved then you're going to
[30:00] have to believe it that way yes
[30:03] and all we get comes by faith
[30:08] said don't get that faith right now up
[30:10] into a super duper revelation right
[30:14] see
[30:16] get it to the point of just simply what
[30:18] it starts out a bit
[30:21] my feminist names the prophet said when
[30:24] your mental faith
[30:27] becomes a spiritual revelation
[30:30] all right
[30:33] see faith then
[30:37] starts off by believing
[30:40] right
[30:42] we got to believe
[30:45] and the main thing to believe is one
[30:47] thing
[30:50] now
[30:54] we say well i believe he died
[30:57] and i believe he died for mankind
[31:00] but i just don't know whether he died
[31:01] for me or not
[31:03] right
[31:05] well what are you concerned about
[31:07] yeah there you go
[31:09] what are you thinking about
[31:15] well i'm thinking about it because
[31:16] something's dealing with it that's right
[31:18] all right amen
[31:20] keep the message in mind what i'm trying
[31:22] to bring across
[31:23] right
[31:25] so then you say well something has been
[31:26] dealing with me
[31:28] well
[31:29] would not not be god calling you
[31:35] all right
[31:36] so believe he's calling you
[31:39] and i believe he's calling other people
[31:41] won't save you
[31:44] you got to believe he's calling you
[31:47] well if you're concerned then
[31:49] something's happening
[31:50] right
[31:51] a work of the holy spirit is within your
[31:53] life
[31:56] to worry that you're being concerned
[31:57] about your life
[32:00] that's why that brother branham was
[32:02] against
[32:03] um he wasn't against alder causing
[32:06] giving them
[32:07] he was against mankind's form of alder
[32:10] calls that they had developed
[32:12] and i was a personal experience of that
[32:14] being
[32:15] uh 18 years old before it's even
[32:17] converted into baptism
[32:19] and my sister i've told you she came to
[32:21] me in church you know trying to get me
[32:23] to come to the altar and otherwise told
[32:24] me embarrass me and everybody in the
[32:26] world trying to get me to come to alder
[32:29] and what she said to me i've told you
[32:32] blunt about it she said
[32:34] her husband got killed in a car wreck
[32:36] and she said jc didn't have an
[32:38] opportunity to repent but you do oh my
[32:41] well
[32:43] i thought more of my brother-in-law's
[32:45] experience with a
[32:47] with god
[32:48] maybe not a salvation but a man
[32:51] then i thought of her super-duper
[32:53] spiritual
[32:54] doings and she told me and i believe her
[32:57] that she had actually been praying and
[32:59] reach out and feel god
[33:01] hold his legs and things and i believe
[33:03] her
[33:04] i wouldn't argue with her about it
[33:07] but see i knew what the man was that she
[33:09] was talking about
[33:10] well she was trying to get me to do
[33:12] something the brother brother says don't
[33:14] do that that's right he said don't go to
[33:17] him and say you know mama was saved
[33:19] daddy was saying you want to go to
[33:21] heaven you got to go the way you need to
[33:24] come to the altar
[33:26] he said you make him a twofold child
[33:29] he said because if they don't get saved
[33:31] that day he says a whole lot harder to
[33:33] get him to come back to the office right
[33:35] so that's why i don't believe in
[33:36] doing things like that
[33:39] you know
[33:40] i have seen it in times when i stood
[33:42] here and spoke the word
[33:43] that people would be saying well i don't
[33:45] have no problem with that
[33:47] i mean that that one that
[33:49] proves out i don't have no problem with
[33:51] that but you don't hear me telling it
[33:53] about everybody right
[33:56] it's just when the lord tells me that
[33:57] that will take place
[33:59] but now get it what is justification
[34:02] then
[34:04] we must believe in justification
[34:06] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[34:09] ghost today makes the new birth right
[34:11] right amen
[34:12] now
[34:13] you do not have in this day now we're
[34:15] here this day we're not back there i
[34:17] explained luther wesley pentecost that
[34:20] was the message of the hour that was the
[34:22] day of god dealing and that was the new
[34:24] birth and that was eternal life right
[34:26] amen
[34:27] but here today is required that we come
[34:29] through water blood spirit
[34:31] justification sanctification the baptism
[34:33] in the holy ghost
[34:35] now
[34:36] you do not have eternal life when you
[34:38] repent of your sins
[34:40] right that's right
[34:44] i know the message so just hold on
[34:46] you don't have eternal life when you're
[34:48] sanctified
[34:49] that's right right
[34:53] and proven it the disciples did not have
[34:55] it right
[34:56] they believed
[34:58] they lived with the lord jesus and saw
[35:00] all of it they were sanctified in saint
[35:02] john 17.
[35:05] but they did not have eternal life
[35:08] all right
[35:09] now you say but i've got a quote okay
[35:11] hold on to that quote
[35:13] it all fits together if you can
[35:17] if you repent of your sins
[35:20] that only chops off your pie sins that's
[35:23] justification that's right run around
[35:25] and explain it like you go out in the
[35:27] yard and you see a glass or something
[35:29] you know
[35:30] you reach down and you pick it up
[35:34] you've got a purpose for it
[35:36] but it's still nasty dirty right
[35:39] you see that's where you justified it
[35:41] cause you picked it
[35:43] no justification
[35:46] being a work of the holy spirit
[35:50] to call us
[35:52] the goodness of god doing it
[35:55] right then
[35:58] at that stage so you repent of your sins
[36:03] and you get baptized
[36:04] no you know when you
[36:06] do the things because you're
[36:08] you're claiming well i'm not a worldly
[36:11] person anymore i'm a christian
[36:13] and i need to live like a christian
[36:16] and uh you know that's what i've done
[36:18] the reason i say i can preach on it and
[36:21] it's odd that an old baptist has to
[36:23] preach justification case
[36:26] the people of this message because
[36:28] they're supposed to be pentecostals
[36:30] right and you can't get one of them
[36:31] hardly to preach on it now you you go
[36:34] listen to tell if you can
[36:36] whether they ever preach anything about
[36:37] justification saying that it's all this
[36:39] great stuff you know somewhere that's up
[36:41] in the mind-boggling situations and no
[36:44] simplicity of salvation
[36:47] you know all right that certainly isn't
[36:49] it's not mine
[36:50] but
[36:52] now justification
[36:56] see it chops off your past sins
[37:00] brother brown said it and i'll give it
[37:02] to you if i don't get it i'll run it off
[37:03] and give them to you this evening
[37:05] or after a while
[37:07] brother brown said that has nothing to
[37:08] do with the future
[37:13] he said you just chopped off your sins
[37:14] right
[37:17] all right
[37:18] you repented
[37:20] you got condemned of what you were doing
[37:23] right
[37:23] and you said i'm sorry
[37:25] you ask god to forgive you
[37:29] if he just wipes that slight clean and
[37:30] there was that we were talking about
[37:32] being perfect and when god wipes
[37:34] anything off the stone right
[37:37] you'll never have to
[37:39] to uh
[37:40] repent again for something you've
[37:42] repented of
[37:44] if it's genuine now we do it because
[37:46] we're human
[37:47] right it's all right but give what i'm
[37:49] saying it's already wiped off
[37:52] there is no sin there if god forgives
[37:54] you
[37:56] so you get under conviction you go to
[37:57] the altar and you say well lord forgive
[37:59] me or some words out sitting out in the
[38:01] woods or or doing something you know
[38:03] people tell about god speaking to them
[38:05] in many different ways you don't have to
[38:07] be in church
[38:09] but the point of it is sometimes you've
[38:11] been in church to learn about god
[38:14] or somebody told you about god
[38:16] you know mom or daddy
[38:18] whatever somebody talk to you about god
[38:20] because we don't believe in just being
[38:22] that see god don't just drop down over
[38:24] in a hot tub of africa and give him the
[38:28] new birth
[38:29] because he hasn't heard the word that's
[38:31] right all right so then truly we
[38:33] understand that jesus had to preach
[38:35] three and a half years
[38:37] before mankind could receive the new
[38:39] birth right
[38:41] all right brother said it was hard for
[38:43] him birth pains to get those pharisees
[38:46] to realize that they were sinners and
[38:48] lost to where he could die for their
[38:50] sins okay that's right
[38:52] without true repentance
[38:55] it's just to simply say i'm sorry
[38:59] lord i'm sorry for the way i've been
[39:01] forgive me
[39:04] all right now
[39:06] there is a quote that i always love to
[39:07] put it right in here because it doesn't
[39:08] cross anything it's perfectly right
[39:11] brother brown said if you die right
[39:13] there
[39:16] sure you're saved
[39:18] now do you need that quote i can be sure
[39:20] to give it for you
[39:22] he said if you died right there when you
[39:23] repented he said surely you're saying
[39:25] that's right that's what people don't
[39:26] understand what brother brown would say
[39:28] saved right and then he'll say born
[39:30] again
[39:32] and then he'll say
[39:33] holy ghost baptism and
[39:37] he was doing just simply what i'm trying
[39:38] to do
[39:39] he was starting off in and you know down
[39:42] here where we're at just talking about
[39:45] the new birth
[39:47] all right
[39:47] and uh
[39:49] see then if you die in that stage where
[39:51] you're truly repented
[39:55] but that don't make you bride
[39:58] now hold on to that
[39:59] because you do not have eternal life
[40:03] you are confessing unto salvation
[40:08] that's right
[40:09] it's not eternal life to repent of your
[40:11] sins
[40:13] it only cleanses out the this gets rid
[40:16] of what the person done you know right
[40:18] in the the soul of being
[40:20] and it does nothing to your future as a
[40:23] matter of fact justification doesn't
[40:24] even work a whole lot in your soul
[40:28] because that one clean spirit is still
[40:30] in there
[40:31] he's just taking right from here back
[40:33] into racing
[40:36] putting it in this seal forgetfulness
[40:39] all right
[40:40] and then see we must move on from that
[40:43] stage
[40:44] and believing it and you start going to
[40:46] church you start acting different and
[40:49] all that's good right because y'all do
[40:52] right now god has done a wonderful thing
[40:54] he has forgiven your sins
[40:58] see that's where a lot of people stop
[41:00] and they say well you know i'm going to
[41:02] church
[41:04] and i like that i'll do it what else you
[41:06] want me to do i just want you to keep on
[41:08] going all right
[41:11] and how many of you heard me make this
[41:13] statement over to
[41:14] 40 something years of your pastor
[41:16] i had rather go
[41:19] down to the end of all this thing
[41:22] and god speak to me at that day and say
[41:26] you had the baptism of the holy ghost 40
[41:28] years ago
[41:31] i said well okay
[41:33] i've been seeking you and i'm glad
[41:36] i keep trying to do that than to go 40
[41:38] years thinking i was saved because of
[41:41] something i've done or didn't do or or
[41:43] whatever or believing the message or are
[41:46] doing it i hope what i've said to you is
[41:48] prove that point nicodemus believed the
[41:50] message nicodemus believed this was god
[41:53] he gave witness to it
[41:56] but none of that saved him
[41:58] but i i he'd rather go through life
[42:00] seeking after god and find out i've
[42:02] already had it had to go through life
[42:04] and refusing to seek it and come up one
[42:06] day and find out i don't have
[42:09] the prophet of god explaining that one
[42:10] day about a person
[42:12] he said when
[42:13] that person's
[42:15] dying he said it came to a place said
[42:18] her real soul came up
[42:22] and she had been to church taught sunday
[42:24] school done all kinds of things
[42:26] basically all her life but said her real
[42:29] soul come up before
[42:31] and said she realized she was lost
[42:35] see now she had suppressed that
[42:38] point
[42:39] and that old preacher was standing there
[42:41] and you know what he said give her
[42:42] another hypo
[42:45] well she would turn around to the
[42:46] preacher said you told me a lie
[42:48] you told me like i said and i lost
[42:52] give her another hypo now you know the
[42:54] doc the preacher didn't say that that
[42:56] was his point the doctors was doing it
[42:59] i'm just making my point
[43:02] but do you truly know that's right that
[43:04] you're born again
[43:08] and upon what basis do you place it
[43:16] i saw god when i was 11 years old that
[43:17] didn't save me
[43:21] and take you today put an x where was
[43:22] standing
[43:24] not as a human being person but
[43:28] as a form that i saw amen
[43:31] from that day on i wanted to find that
[43:32] god right
[43:34] but that didn't save me
[43:38] i searched for him but i couldn't find
[43:39] him
[43:41] joined the church when i was 18 years
[43:43] old
[43:45] went to church dating my wife because
[43:47] there was no way i could go to church
[43:48] and get to go with her on sunday
[43:50] afternoon
[43:51] was to go to church
[43:53] you know
[43:54] admit i didn't hear much the preacher
[43:56] said
[43:58] but that's right
[43:59] just honest
[44:00] you'll be that way to help you too
[44:03] but
[44:04] you know
[44:05] but one day see it come to reality you
[44:08] know you've heard me say this that the
[44:10] deacons came to me one or two of them
[44:12] one day won't talk to me about salvation
[44:14] i said listen
[44:15] i live a better life than your deacon
[44:17] lord does
[44:19] and then you better ask me what i meant
[44:23] because i knew what they was doing
[44:27] see because that was what got in my way
[44:30] it was church people right
[44:33] for heaven help don't let anybody right
[44:35] anyway
[44:36] that's right
[44:37] i had to come to realize one day that
[44:39] one thing about it brother modi used to
[44:41] tell me about it my life it was down
[44:43] here in lula
[44:44] and the policeman came up and this
[44:46] little boy was there he was sitting
[44:49] behind the post you know two before
[44:51] and the policeman shined his light out
[44:53] there and said what are you doing son he
[44:54] said i'm hiding
[44:56] there was more of him sticking out than
[44:58] he was behind the boat
[45:00] and that always dwelt with me is to to
[45:03] not want to be anything like that right
[45:06] i've always wanted to be right and
[45:08] sincere right
[45:09] you know i don't have to put on anything
[45:12] we go hunting we do
[45:15] we we just go on in we do our thing
[45:17] right
[45:18] and if anybody wants to talk about the
[45:19] lord we talk about it if they don't we
[45:22] just talk among ourselves and go on you
[45:24] know and don't worry about it because i
[45:25] don't want to be something that i'm not
[45:27] i don't want to be labeled as a
[45:29] hypocrite
[45:30] you know i want to be what i am all the
[45:32] time but i'm just talking to you
[45:34] the about salvation
[45:37] well see
[45:38] i come to realize one day that i
[45:40] couldn't hide behind something
[45:44] it didn't matter whether it was a whole
[45:45] lot bigger than i was or a whole lot
[45:47] smaller
[45:49] that i had to face myself
[45:53] at 18 years old then i faced myself and
[45:55] i said lord
[45:57] i'm sorry
[45:59] forgive me
[46:01] well of course nevada's all you had to
[46:02] do is get up and confess
[46:04] i kind of like what they told the story
[46:06] about the little boys three or four of
[46:08] them up there you know
[46:09] each one of them was up and they said
[46:10] what's the lord done for you and he said
[46:12] let me save my soul and got down to the
[46:13] end when there's a little boy
[46:15] what's the lord done for you he said
[46:16] ain't done nothing yet
[46:18] well at least he's honest
[46:20] i mean he was riding it he stole it like
[46:22] it was
[46:23] right well
[46:26] you know they thought a lot of me and
[46:27] the time i had
[46:29] been there from 58 to 63 i was an
[46:32] ordained deacon
[46:34] so you know they must have thought a lot
[46:35] of me and
[46:36] everything i was teaching adult sunday
[46:38] school classes the company elders and
[46:40] the things when i left
[46:42] but i'm not telling that i'm just
[46:44] telling you they saw something
[46:46] because i always wanted
[46:48] to know about god
[46:51] i like what brother brown says and if
[46:53] when you know i don't mean just one
[46:54] place i love it but he said if you ever
[46:58] have one little touch of god he said you
[46:59] will never be the son right
[47:02] you can't get away from it that's right
[47:05] i tried you know and i just i
[47:09] i don't like i do now i'm still seeking
[47:11] god right right
[47:13] and i every day i say lord save me
[47:19] just fill me with your love you know
[47:22] to the point that i can just be what you
[47:24] want me to be right
[47:27] he said well i thought you said you're
[47:28] saying a long time ago i don't know
[47:31] but i believe in salvation that
[47:33] continually goes on
[47:35] i believe in what peter says being born
[47:37] again right by the incorruptible word i
[47:40] believe that's what this prophet's
[47:41] message come to do was to bring us from
[47:43] a to a place to where we could see
[47:45] salvation as it really was
[47:48] and to be able to accept
[47:50] what god would give us and continually
[47:53] seek god amen
[47:55] you know
[47:56] and just walk on
[47:58] but see
[48:00] we get all tied up in our theologies
[48:04] forgive me
[48:06] we get tied up in
[48:09] what we've been taught yeah
[48:12] and every church teaches something
[48:14] you know
[48:16] right wherever you come from you say
[48:18] well i didn't i don't know much about
[48:19] you you heard something because they
[48:21] taught it to you
[48:23] and uh you know we think about them
[48:25] saying those little songs when this kid
[48:27] you know
[48:29] father son and holy ghost blessed
[48:31] trinity
[48:33] you know
[48:35] let's see we were taught that right and
[48:37] all that dwells within our mentality
[48:40] well remember justification works
[48:41] through your mentality
[48:45] that's where it's working now true
[48:47] mentality
[48:49] of an individual right
[48:51] and then you you come to that place see
[48:53] that you can finally say well
[48:55] i believe
[48:57] you read the i love to read matthew
[48:59] martin luther john you remember one time
[49:01] our disciple said something to the lord
[49:03] jesus and you know it's probably about
[49:05] three years after he'd been talking to
[49:06] him i guess it was a shock he probably
[49:10] do you now believe
[49:12] you know
[49:14] see it took on all that time to come to
[49:15] that place that they really believed in
[49:17] the way he knew
[49:19] because he could look inside and see
[49:20] they were really believing all right
[49:22] let's see now let's get one thing
[49:24] straight and then we'll just do a little
[49:26] bit on
[49:27] and i want to just talk to you but get
[49:31] see we don't believe in works
[49:34] we believe in works following our
[49:36] salvation
[49:37] amen
[49:40] works is what i do for him salvation is
[49:42] what he done for me
[49:44] so we believe in doing work we're living
[49:46] the living right and and doing right and
[49:48] acting right
[49:50] and being condemned to the things y'all
[49:52] remember that that and like i said when
[49:55] i come into the message a lot of you
[49:57] can't say the points i can because
[49:59] you know i
[50:01] mean hey i didn't care nothing about
[50:02] drinking i didn't care nothing about
[50:04] smoking
[50:06] you know the lord didn't have to deliver
[50:08] me from them things
[50:09] and thank god he does deliver people you
[50:12] know
[50:12] but i mean i i said well
[50:15] you know
[50:16] what would chris what would jesus do in
[50:18] this situation
[50:20] and always try to to think about it like
[50:22] that now i know i made a lot of failures
[50:24] don't think you're looking at a goody
[50:26] two-shoes never have that old saying no
[50:28] you're looking at a human being that's
[50:30] honest right and just telling you like
[50:32] it is
[50:33] all right
[50:35] and uh
[50:36] you know i thank god for all those
[50:37] people who tried to help me down through
[50:39] there right
[50:40] doesn't matter what's the matter this
[50:41] baptist or whatever it is thank god for
[50:43] the people who try to help you thank you
[50:46] and try to do something for you right
[50:49] all right
[50:50] you know maybe god will give them you
[50:52] ever thought about it sure maybe god
[50:54] might give them eternal life one day
[50:57] for what they were doing to try to help
[50:58] you
[50:59] and there maybe you as the loss just
[51:01] could be
[51:02] but yet god knows all about it man it
[51:04] was a great thing might be surprising we
[51:07] get there you know
[51:08] and things can happen but now go on
[51:12] we believe in
[51:13] works following our salvation but we
[51:16] don't believe in works as our salvation
[51:19] right
[51:21] no
[51:23] you get saved and then works follow
[51:26] me you know
[51:28] you got to get the baby here amen right
[51:31] that's right right
[51:32] you get the baby here then the baby
[51:35] starts crying speaking in tongues and
[51:37] doing all kinds of things
[51:40] but get that to the point see because we
[51:42] we we believe in three
[51:45] stages
[51:46] of grace
[51:48] go ahead brothers and pull that first
[51:50] one up let's read a little bit
[51:52] but we don't believe in works and see we
[51:54] call it three works of grace
[51:56] now i want you to understand you may
[51:57] read what brother random will say and
[51:59] there is one of these quotes in here
[52:01] that he actually is saying uh
[52:02] manifestation of stages in any minute he
[52:04] says works
[52:07] three words
[52:08] but the one thing i want you to think
[52:10] about
[52:12] and i told her this today is i begin to
[52:15] pull a few quotes together because i
[52:16] didn't have anything until this morning
[52:19] written down i just do a lot of thinking
[52:22] but you see
[52:24] we think of works
[52:26] three works of grace
[52:29] all right you know what i loved about
[52:30] brother brown that made me think of it
[52:32] and then how many how many of you heard
[52:33] me say this uh how is it that brother
[52:35] dale checks the doctrine to see what
[52:37] it's right or not
[52:40] buy my own new birth
[52:42] now why are you gonna check it back
[52:44] quotes
[52:46] ah they quote as much as you can quote
[52:48] and they'll quote them very quote to you
[52:50] as you quote because then in
[52:51] trinitarians we used to talk to them you
[52:53] know i did the bad just a baptist
[52:55] doctrine there's one god
[52:57] of course we didn't understand it we
[52:58] called it god and three persons but you
[53:00] talk about three gods we tell you in a
[53:02] hurry that was hedonism
[53:04] but you know what they read the same
[53:06] scriptures we read right
[53:09] now they read the proof three we read
[53:10] the proof one
[53:12] well so is it in the message of the hour
[53:15] you know
[53:16] that's right but the the quotes are
[53:18] right it's just our understanding
[53:20] about those things so remember we don't
[53:23] believe in three works of grace because
[53:25] works would mean something you had to do
[53:27] with it
[53:28] i believe what it joined to it now that
[53:30] salvation is of the lord amen
[53:33] and if justification is a work of the
[53:35] holy spirit
[53:37] then it's certainly not a human being
[53:41] ezekiel is waivers on the other day what
[53:43] he takes out the old stony heart
[53:46] he gives you a new spirit brother and
[53:48] said that's not the holy spirit
[53:50] he said then i put my spirit as equals
[53:53] he said that's the baptism now
[53:57] see but you know we can get new desires
[53:59] new thoughts and new ways of doing we'll
[54:01] cover some of the sanctification and the
[54:03] things to get onto it but look what the
[54:05] prophet is saying you see each one of
[54:07] those ages only take a dip into the holy
[54:09] spirit justification is the work of the
[54:11] holy spirit sanctification is the work
[54:12] of the holy spirit but the baptism is
[54:14] the holy spirit i never forget that
[54:16] quote
[54:19] justification is a work of the holy
[54:21] spirit
[54:22] now you see why brother branham will
[54:24] interlake works and why james and paul
[54:26] and their talkings and things
[54:28] because
[54:30] god doesn't work
[54:32] on you right amen it's not works that
[54:36] saves us
[54:38] but god doesn't work on you right
[54:43] you repent of your sins you know what he
[54:45] worked on you right
[54:46] that's right
[54:48] he cleaned you up
[54:49] right
[54:50] all right but never forget the statement
[54:53] around the same justification is the
[54:54] work of the holy spirit sanctification
[54:56] is the work of the holy spirit
[54:58] he said but the baptism
[55:00] that's right he is the holy spirit right
[55:03] all right
[55:04] emphasizing
[55:06] what it is
[55:07] see uh then the baptism of the holy
[55:10] ghost is not a work
[55:12] it's a life that's right i don't you
[55:15] know what i'm trying to back it up i
[55:16] want to stay on justification
[55:19] all right but look at the next one it's
[55:21] not three words it's three
[55:22] manifestations
[55:24] and then there was justification i can't
[55:26] take it back to when the holy ghost not
[55:28] three different dispensations now listen
[55:30] to it
[55:31] he's explaining it so carefully listen
[55:35] not three words of grace
[55:38] but one word in three different
[55:40] manifestations
[55:41] same holy ghost was with luther under
[55:44] justification was with
[55:46] was under wesley with sanctification in
[55:49] the church now in the baptism of the
[55:50] holy ghost the same holy spirit
[55:53] not to the holy spirit it's the same
[55:55] holy spirit
[55:58] as i said a minute ago how do you check
[56:00] a doctrine
[56:01] just keep checking it by this man
[56:04] three
[56:06] manifestations of grace three stages
[56:09] within those three manifestations of god
[56:12] amen
[56:13] right
[56:14] father
[56:19] that's three manifestations of the same
[56:21] god
[56:22] the same god
[56:25] called you to repentance is the same god
[56:27] that sanctifies you saying god
[56:33] i wanted to get these on here where you
[56:35] would you know into other people
[56:36] especially
[56:37] now christian friend a person cannot be
[56:39] born again until they have received the
[56:41] holy spirit
[56:42] so you can't you're not even converted
[56:45] until you receive the holy ghost
[56:48] i'm not say
[56:50] listen i'm not saying you're lost
[56:54] before you receive the holy ghost
[56:57] because you're not
[56:59] and that goes with that statement that
[57:00] you made while ago you're not saying i
[57:02] want to go to it he said
[57:04] when you repent of your sins he said
[57:06] you're saved yes sir
[57:09] he said if you die right there sure
[57:11] you're going to heaven
[57:14] but he didn't call you the bride
[57:16] and he don't talk about you with eternal
[57:18] life so you'd have to come up with a
[57:19] foolish virgin
[57:20] right
[57:21] so now once he's doing the same thing
[57:24] you're not even converted until you
[57:25] receive the holy ghost i'm not saying
[57:27] your loss because you re before you
[57:29] receive the holy ghost because you're
[57:30] not
[57:31] there is three there is one work of
[57:33] grace only one work of grace that's the
[57:36] holy spirit
[57:37] and it's made in three manifestations
[57:41] just like there's one god made in three
[57:43] manifestations called a son and holy
[57:45] spirit one god only one now there is the
[57:47] three words
[57:48] now there is the three words of grace
[57:51] you quote that out of there cut it you
[57:52] make him say what you want him to say
[57:55] he's just got to explain it it's not
[57:57] words
[57:58] and there's not three words and then
[58:00] when he makes a statement of three works
[58:01] of grace but there's three
[58:03] manifestations right
[58:05] so he just didn't go in with the book
[58:06] before you know i heard it before or
[58:08] whatever put it in there
[58:10] all right
[58:10] there's a manifestation of justification
[58:13] by faith a man believes god say yes sir
[58:16] i believe that i believe it's the true
[58:18] god he said all right now
[58:20] so it's not three works
[58:23] it's three manifestations of the same
[58:25] holy spirit
[58:27] amen
[58:29] the god that brought you to repentance
[58:31] is the god that filled your soul by the
[58:33] baptism
[58:34] right
[58:35] so it's not three works right
[58:39] it's three stages or three
[58:41] manifestations because it's not three
[58:43] gods amen that's right
[58:46] there's three manifestations of god
[58:48] right now he's tying it all together
[58:51] that's how i check my any doctrine that
[58:53] comes along just this thing this second
[58:55] thing
[58:57] i don't feel what god done in my soul
[58:59] right right
[59:02] oh you always was this and you always
[59:04] was that and you don't need salvation
[59:07] you know what the people in this receipt
[59:09] you don't need it because you always was
[59:11] eternal
[59:16] then the same prophet said you got to
[59:18] come to the altar to receive eternal
[59:19] life right
[59:21] the same one will tell you about three
[59:22] different ways that he's born again if
[59:24] you listen to the master one's in the
[59:26] woodshed and one of them is running down
[59:28] the railroad track
[59:30] i don't know what happened i just know i
[59:33] believe he got born again
[59:36] but you just listen the message a lot
[59:38] and you'll hear a lot of statements that
[59:39] seem to be contrary one to the other
[59:42] you know
[59:43] he'll tell you he was over here when he
[59:45] was really over here he just took him
[59:46] away
[59:47] all right but now watch so where's our
[59:50] salvation in three stages go ahead
[59:52] you gotta do
[59:54] number four
[59:56] okay
[59:58] so now notice what he's saying i just
[59:59] highlighted this tab but
[1:00:01] uh here's to those who do not have the
[1:00:03] holy spirit born again as the scripture
[1:00:06] speaks of being born again if the
[1:00:07] natural work requires and that's what
[1:00:09] somebody asked him a question if the
[1:00:11] natural birth requires water blood and
[1:00:13] spirit does not the spiritual birth
[1:00:14] require all these stages of grace before
[1:00:17] the person is truly born again
[1:00:19] absolutely
[1:00:20] i just explained that this morning the
[1:00:22] same on the same thing
[1:00:24] you've got to have all stages
[1:00:27] you're begotten of the spirit
[1:00:30] just like a baby's begotten into the
[1:00:32] wound of a mother
[1:00:34] but not born until they receive the holy
[1:00:37] ghost
[1:00:38] that's right in other words the baby's
[1:00:40] not gonna lie till it comes and you
[1:00:41] don't have any work you see holy ghost
[1:00:43] right right
[1:00:44] you're born again
[1:00:47] so you're not
[1:00:48] you're born then
[1:00:50] you're not converted right you're in the
[1:00:53] process of being converted until that
[1:00:56] time
[1:00:58] like a baby begotten in the wound of a
[1:01:00] mother
[1:01:01] you know the other day we would have
[1:01:03] turned
[1:01:04] in alabama and got the word that brother
[1:01:07] joe was going to be an uncle
[1:01:12] he's certainly not going to be a man
[1:01:16] they found out she's going to have a boy
[1:01:18] okay everybody got it
[1:01:21] i just use a stage of an uncle you know
[1:01:24] because that's what i told my wife and
[1:01:26] then when i said i go good i found out i
[1:01:27] have an uncle
[1:01:29] you know next door neighbor has nothing
[1:01:30] to do with i'm just making a point okay
[1:01:33] joe's gonna he's the daddy of the baby
[1:01:36] it's going to be a little boy everybody
[1:01:38] guys
[1:01:39] so it made him an
[1:01:41] uncle not an ain't
[1:01:42] all right
[1:01:44] yeah get all of it together but listen
[1:01:48] see three manifestations but that baby
[1:01:52] in the wound of a mother
[1:01:54] and that's why this prophet's message is
[1:01:56] so valuable
[1:01:57] see science says today that baby is
[1:01:59] alive
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:02] it's got a heartbeat that's got all of
[1:02:03] the things
[1:02:04] it can cry it can do everything
[1:02:09] but thank god for a prophet
[1:02:11] that's right
[1:02:14] that'll tell us that baby is not alive
[1:02:17] it's not a living soul
[1:02:20] until it's born from its mother
[1:02:23] and receives the breath of life
[1:02:26] you are not a living soul
[1:02:29] until you receive the breath of eternal
[1:02:32] life right
[1:02:36] that's what the scripture talking about
[1:02:37] he become a living soul adam become a
[1:02:39] living soul right amen
[1:02:45] but are you following me yes
[1:02:47] three stages of grace
[1:02:49] all right look at the next one number
[1:02:51] five
[1:02:52] we got just a little bit of future home
[1:02:53] but i'd ask you
[1:02:55] at least by wednesday for you to click
[1:02:57] over about page 15
[1:02:59] 14 15 the future home read it listen to
[1:03:02] the type
[1:03:03] and listen to brother around explain it
[1:03:06] and he's explaining the redemption of
[1:03:08] the world
[1:03:10] really as the point of his message
[1:03:12] and the future home etc and where we're
[1:03:14] going what's going to happen in the
[1:03:15] world but he said if you don't get
[1:03:17] nothing else get the plan of salvation
[1:03:19] that's right amen
[1:03:21] he could tie it all together so listen
[1:03:23] what he says now future home and notice
[1:03:25] how god makes plain to us the plan of
[1:03:27] redemption oh this just thrilled my
[1:03:29] shoulder and i saw it i'm explaining to
[1:03:31] us now his plan of redemption now
[1:03:34] compare what we see with our own eyes
[1:03:36] what god has done to redeem his world
[1:03:39] he's done the same plan to redeem his
[1:03:41] people for the unchangeable god changes
[1:03:44] not in any of his plans or anything such
[1:03:47] a glorious thing
[1:03:48] how he led us to himself to a tabernacle
[1:03:51] in us by the three stages of grace
[1:03:54] just like he led he's led the world in
[1:03:57] three
[1:03:58] stages to come to the world as god will
[1:04:01] come
[1:04:02] god will come to the world
[1:04:04] what
[1:04:05] after he's gone through three different
[1:04:06] stages of purification that's exactly
[1:04:09] how he comes to us through the three
[1:04:11] stages of grace i taught that at the
[1:04:13] beginning i've never changed since it's
[1:04:16] god's own word now there's two
[1:04:17] statements in there
[1:04:19] in the future home that he makes that
[1:04:20] identical statement right you know what
[1:04:22] they're saying now that brought around
[1:04:23] taught it one way now he's taught it
[1:04:25] another way
[1:04:27] they thought he said he taught the new
[1:04:28] birth his justification case the baptism
[1:04:30] in the holy ghost
[1:04:32] and you know but now in the end time
[1:04:34] message when they got the great
[1:04:36] revelation of what he was really saying
[1:04:38] that now they believe he was just
[1:04:39] teaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:42] you know it's the new birth
[1:04:44] well see all of that can be tied up into
[1:04:47] man's ideas of thinking and it confuses
[1:04:49] people right
[1:04:51] and that's what i said you ever heard
[1:04:52] him preach on the new birth
[1:04:57] i mean i'm just i'm talking to you
[1:04:58] honest i'm not being exalted or anything
[1:05:00] i'm just asking you a question
[1:05:03] you come from these other churches but
[1:05:05] did your pastor ever tell you about what
[1:05:06] it was to be justified
[1:05:08] or sanctified or filled with the holy
[1:05:10] ghost
[1:05:12] right
[1:05:16] well
[1:05:18] i'm sorry to be too blunt maybe they
[1:05:20] don't understand that's why they don't
[1:05:22] talk about it
[1:05:23] that's right oh that's the old days and
[1:05:26] old doctrine thing i still love it all
[1:05:29] right man
[1:05:30] i'm sitting there today and i thought
[1:05:32] why am i gonna listen to it i went to
[1:05:33] the fifth seal you know the
[1:05:36] longest
[1:05:37] fifth of six seal questions and answers
[1:05:39] in the seven seals
[1:05:40] what am i gonna listen to
[1:05:43] i just clicked that opponent
[1:05:46] 53 that's a good one
[1:05:49] presume it
[1:05:50] that was the message
[1:05:52] i love to hear those old messages
[1:05:56] i'm not in the doctrine or the message
[1:05:58] or the hour that claims it you know that
[1:06:00] you you can't believe nothing for the
[1:06:02] seagulls
[1:06:03] you got to get everything after the seal
[1:06:07] the son of man came to straighten
[1:06:09] brother branham
[1:06:12] i don't believe none of that amen
[1:06:14] garbage can to me
[1:06:17] all right
[1:06:18] but you see what i'm trying to get
[1:06:19] across
[1:06:23] the new birth that's right
[1:06:26] starts with justification that's right
[1:06:30] just like a baby starts when it's
[1:06:32] conceived in the mother's womb
[1:06:35] but it's not alive
[1:06:38] you say well they can show them crying
[1:06:40] that's all right because that's fine
[1:06:43] a dog you you look at the dog in there
[1:06:45] and it's doing the same thing
[1:06:48] monkey preach
[1:06:50] or whatever it's doing the same thing
[1:06:53] it's not a living soul that's right all
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:57] i'm not trying to straighten science out
[1:06:59] i'd run around wouldn't try and do
[1:07:00] anything just telling like it is right
[1:07:04] then when the baby's born or the dogs
[1:07:06] born or the cat's born or whatever a
[1:07:08] life comes into the animal
[1:07:11] right
[1:07:12] it becomes a living animal
[1:07:15] but a human being the life comes into
[1:07:17] their soul and they become a living soul
[1:07:21] all right
[1:07:22] and that's what he's trying to explain
[1:07:24] to nicodemus
[1:07:26] the name is your living soul right
[1:07:29] see we just read one little bit we read
[1:07:31] and we think that was all it said you
[1:07:33] think that that jesus turned around
[1:07:34] there you must be born again he
[1:07:36] gets up and walked out
[1:07:38] they probably sat for hours discussing
[1:07:41] this right
[1:07:43] but he couldn't comprehend it right
[1:07:47] and surely like jesus was saying with
[1:07:49] nicodemus you're a product of your
[1:07:50] mother you come through water you come
[1:07:53] through blood you come through life
[1:07:56] let's see we just read a little bit that
[1:07:58] was
[1:07:59] put in the words for us to read
[1:08:02] and then he was said well i know what
[1:08:04] you're saying is right
[1:08:07] and i can't understand it
[1:08:11] because you see they miss the kingdom
[1:08:15] they miss the thing that jesus was
[1:08:17] speaking of that the kingdom must come
[1:08:20] then it must be within you
[1:08:22] you know you've heard that argue
[1:08:23] presbyterian target right brother dick
[1:08:25] whether it was in jesus or within the
[1:08:27] people or just out here somewhere
[1:08:29] you know where is it
[1:08:33] jesus said it's within
[1:08:35] it was within him right amen but then he
[1:08:38] released it on the day of pentecost it
[1:08:40] came within the disciples
[1:08:43] he said what happened to them
[1:08:45] they had been justified
[1:08:49] they had been sanctified unless you
[1:08:51] thought of that
[1:08:53] but they were not born again
[1:08:55] that's right
[1:08:57] they had repented their sins they got
[1:08:59] baptized they've done all the things
[1:09:02] and they got sanctified the unclean
[1:09:04] spirit went out of them
[1:09:08] but yet
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:11] they were not born again
[1:09:14] now you
[1:09:15] do what you like but judas went through
[1:09:17] those stages too
[1:09:24] judas was there in the upper room
[1:09:26] washington let jesus wash his feet
[1:09:30] taking the bread to communion
[1:09:41] but then it entered into his heart
[1:09:45] because his heart was not born again
[1:09:50] truly you can see then in judas what
[1:09:52] happened
[1:09:53] the unclean spirit that had been driven
[1:09:55] out
[1:09:56] came back
[1:09:58] right
[1:09:59] and took up his abode
[1:10:02] and he went out
[1:10:06] and turned the lord jesus up oh they
[1:10:09] have stories now they got all about the
[1:10:10] judas movies they got the things that
[1:10:12] judas wouldn't such a bad guy i never
[1:10:14] have thrown off on him
[1:10:18] he was a human being
[1:10:20] he was a person
[1:10:25] oh you said yeah but he was a son of
[1:10:26] perdition i explained that
[1:10:29] all right explain that that's what i
[1:10:31] want answers i like answers to things i
[1:10:34] was when was judas the son of perdition
[1:10:37] well he was born now
[1:10:39] well so was you amen
[1:10:49] you're talking about me when you get
[1:10:50] your feelings hurt you know what it
[1:10:51] proves
[1:10:52] that i was right
[1:10:56] because if not you say amen amen
[1:10:59] because you realize where you come from
[1:11:00] that's right
[1:11:03] all right
[1:11:05] but you see
[1:11:10] we'll just touch this a little bit and
[1:11:11] quit
[1:11:12] run around there in the future home he
[1:11:14] said that there's nothing to your future
[1:11:16] right that's it
[1:11:18] he said just like it was with the world
[1:11:21] he said in the days of noah it was just
[1:11:23] washed off
[1:11:24] cleaned all the sin and all the garbage
[1:11:27] on it
[1:11:28] and it come forth a brand new world
[1:11:32] but it wasn't eternal
[1:11:36] he said that's what happens to you and i
[1:11:38] he said we see we're lost and we need to
[1:11:40] be saved and we repent and we follow
[1:11:42] after we get water baptized and you know
[1:11:44] we go home
[1:11:48] we believe the message of the hour
[1:11:52] but we've got to go home from there
[1:11:57] because the disciples believed all of
[1:11:58] that and walked with the lord jesus
[1:12:03] they had come to saint john 17.
[1:12:06] that the unclean spirit driven out of
[1:12:08] them
[1:12:09] by the word of jesus christ
[1:12:13] oh we preached sanctification you quit
[1:12:14] smoking you quit drinking quit chewing
[1:12:17] well i didn't do it was i saved all the
[1:12:19] time
[1:12:22] see that's where god puts people in a
[1:12:23] place sometimes that they can just blend
[1:12:25] right back out in your lap and ask you a
[1:12:26] question
[1:12:28] was i saying degree that i didn't drink
[1:12:32] no
[1:12:33] i didn't like the looks of the stuff and
[1:12:34] i didn't like what it done to people
[1:12:40] stumped to me
[1:12:42] he's always sweet to me yeah you're on
[1:12:44] the other side
[1:12:46] because something was done dealing with
[1:12:47] me
[1:12:49] maybe you didn't get your dealings till
[1:12:51] later on
[1:12:53] i've told you about it i go out the
[1:12:55] world do something wrong come home and
[1:12:57] feel dirty
[1:13:00] and even ask god to forgive me
[1:13:06] i could just tell you my life
[1:13:11] you know but i did a couple nights
[1:13:12] saying
[1:13:13] you're not saved
[1:13:15] if you've got the new birth you're saved
[1:13:18] no matter what you was behind
[1:13:20] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:23] it's just god keeps some people maybe
[1:13:25] where they can tell it brother brown
[1:13:26] said that he wanted to drink
[1:13:28] he tried to
[1:13:30] he wanted to smoke
[1:13:32] god wouldn't let it come on read the
[1:13:34] message
[1:13:38] he kept him from doing it right
[1:13:41] to where he'd have a witness
[1:13:43] right that's it
[1:13:44] well maybe he kept me a little bit down
[1:13:46] through there i didn't say i was dirty
[1:13:47] enough
[1:13:49] guilty of the least his guilt in the
[1:13:50] hole right amen
[1:13:54] but it's just where somebody can talk
[1:13:56] yes right amen
[1:13:58] so you claim that's your salvation
[1:14:00] well i must have had it before you ever
[1:14:02] thought about it because i didn't do it
[1:14:06] but get what i'm saying
[1:14:08] justification
[1:14:10] god convicts you of your life that's
[1:14:13] right you go to the altar wherever
[1:14:15] you know it doesn't matter out in the
[1:14:16] woods i'm
[1:14:18] doing things you can be working god can
[1:14:20] speak to him you can do all that brother
[1:14:22] i remember him telling me about sitting
[1:14:23] out under the
[1:14:25] uh
[1:14:26] sitting kind of on the fence road or
[1:14:27] something nerdy house he said this is
[1:14:29] like rain water just coming down on me
[1:14:31] you know what
[1:14:34] sure
[1:14:35] you know everybody don't have the same
[1:14:36] experience
[1:14:38] now let me correct that order of saying
[1:14:40] it we all have the same experience
[1:14:42] but we have different manifestations
[1:14:45] right
[1:14:47] just no more than it's three works
[1:14:49] it's one word with three manifestations
[1:14:52] it's the same holy spirit
[1:14:57] that called you brother charlie cox went
[1:14:59] around and said but charlie said this
[1:15:01] god that called you and told you to turn
[1:15:03] around
[1:15:04] he said he'll call you one day
[1:15:06] and tell you to come up
[1:15:10] same god that calls you the same god's
[1:15:12] going to change
[1:15:13] amen
[1:15:14] right but you know what i'm talking
[1:15:15] about did you work have you ever just
[1:15:17] really got under conviction right yes
[1:15:20] the lord i'm sorry
[1:15:26] then that's why brother branham will say
[1:15:27] to a christian then sin becomes dirty
[1:15:32] now he didn't say he wasn't going to be
[1:15:33] tempted
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:39] it becomes dirty
[1:15:43] well because there's something about you
[1:15:44] this
[1:15:46] even at repentance you don't want to go
[1:15:47] back and do that again
[1:15:55] and you try to find somebody like wrote
[1:15:57] around the city
[1:15:58] you know the lord was dealing with him
[1:15:59] and he said he went down to this church
[1:16:02] it wasn't it went down to another one
[1:16:06] he even talked about going to the
[1:16:07] catholic
[1:16:08] yeah
[1:16:09] because he was catholic when they
[1:16:11] started he said it didn't happen
[1:16:15] well you know what
[1:16:16] he couldn't find a church
[1:16:18] yeah that spirit of elijah not as a new
[1:16:22] birth
[1:16:23] but that anointing upon him would not
[1:16:25] let him be satisfied in any of those
[1:16:27] churches
[1:16:32] because it would tell him the truth
[1:16:33] about it that's it
[1:16:35] he'd go to look at it
[1:16:38] you ever heard him tell about he said
[1:16:41] good lord i know i can't pray
[1:16:45] he said charles writes you a letter
[1:16:50] they wrote him a letter stuck it up on a
[1:16:51] tree hopefully he'd come by and read it
[1:16:55] you heard the story about the person
[1:16:56] that couldn't even do nothing but they
[1:16:57] just wrote down the abcs they get on the
[1:16:59] tree somewhere or something he said lord
[1:17:01] you just put the words
[1:17:04] they all are right you just put them
[1:17:06] together
[1:17:09] now i'm talking about a god that's real
[1:17:14] not just a fictitive of your imagination
[1:17:16] or a good thought or good reasonings or
[1:17:18] whatever all those are well and good
[1:17:23] but have you really ever been just fully
[1:17:25] convicted another dick was talking about
[1:17:27] somebody who wasn't a lady
[1:17:29] that
[1:17:30] and they asked about it she said well
[1:17:32] i'm born in church
[1:17:34] you know it's born here
[1:17:36] you know you could do that i was in the
[1:17:38] message
[1:17:39] right
[1:17:40] i mean i cut my teeth on the message
[1:17:41] pews you know
[1:17:44] but that don't save you
[1:17:48] but ronald even says if you women don't
[1:17:50] think cause you've got long hair and
[1:17:51] long dresses that you're going to heaven
[1:17:54] that's right
[1:18:11] that's what i said up there and i
[1:18:12] thought lord
[1:18:14] just give me some way
[1:18:17] to help those people that
[1:18:19] are not certain
[1:18:21] about where they stand that's right
[1:18:24] to where they can do what you need to do
[1:18:27] all right
[1:18:28] now
[1:18:29] then do what i'm saying just
[1:18:32] simply sitting right there in your seat
[1:18:34] if you're here or if you're on tape
[1:18:36] listening or whatever just simply say
[1:18:38] lord i believe something's been dealing
[1:18:41] with me or i wouldn't be concerned
[1:18:42] that's right right
[1:18:44] amen so lord forgive me of my sin
[1:18:50] but then you've got to believe
[1:18:52] that's
[1:18:55] that's the point you got to believe
[1:18:58] you said well i don't know whether he
[1:18:59] hurt me or not he hears that we know the
[1:19:02] prophet's word he hears everything
[1:19:06] he said he hears everything that's right
[1:19:08] don't you think he'd hear you
[1:19:11] lord i'm sorry
[1:19:12] that's right and remember it's his
[1:19:14] goodness that calls you to repentance
[1:19:18] it's his goodness that calls you
[1:19:20] right
[1:19:21] he's calling you can't come unless he's
[1:19:23] calling you right right
[1:19:27] but you how long you want to stay the
[1:19:29] word of prophet would say it like this
[1:19:30] so i said i don't know what to teach i
[1:19:32] want to try but he said every person in
[1:19:34] the world
[1:19:39] when i was a hot and taunt in africa and
[1:19:41] i just use that point i'm not against
[1:19:43] we'll say india
[1:19:48] why are those people worshiping idols
[1:19:53] you don't ever think about it
[1:19:56] why are they worshiping totem pope
[1:20:00] because your prophet said there's a soul
[1:20:02] in
[1:20:15] he said no there's just a chosen seeds
[1:20:18] only one cries out
[1:20:21] see you've listened to all that you got
[1:20:22] lost in your birth
[1:20:25] get born again
[1:20:28] you won't be worried about seed
[1:20:32] the truth will come to you
[1:20:34] because he's on her mount to bring you
[1:20:36] the truth if you're born again
[1:20:38] that's right
[1:20:39] make him lose language
[1:20:42] okay 1.4 inspired book 124 anybody has a
[1:20:46] need but just do what i say disabled
[1:20:48] lord
[1:20:49] i'm sorry
[1:20:58] you want to spray with yourself
