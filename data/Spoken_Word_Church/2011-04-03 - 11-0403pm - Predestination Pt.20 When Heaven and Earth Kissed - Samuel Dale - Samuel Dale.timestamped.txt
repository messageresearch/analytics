[0:01] we coming up to the uh time to get
[0:04] together about getting the food for the
[0:06] camp so we're going to set a menu uh the
[0:09] camp is in July the last weekend in July
[0:13] and uh if we start now we don't have to
[0:16] do as much this year as we did last year
[0:18] because the camp has been shortened by
[0:20] one day so there'll be four meals that
[0:22] we don't have to fix but uh you've been
[0:24] generous in the past and U and I I think
[0:28] that generosity can just carry on to the
[0:30] next year we will have a list of what we
[0:33] need uh if you want to give us money and
[0:37] we'll go buy the stuff that's fine and
[0:40] we are also this year brother Joe got us
[0:43] a lot of cakes and stuff last year uh
[0:46] free and I don't think we're going to be
[0:47] able to do that so we're going to have
[0:49] to get all of you just Bak some cookies
[0:51] and cakes and and cupcakes and all that
[0:55] good fattening stuff and U do it like we
[0:58] did a couple years ago but just wanted
[1:00] you to keep that in your heart and in
[1:02] your mind be praying about it uh June
[1:04] and I are definitely going to be there
[1:05] and I know some of you are going to go
[1:07] with us um some of you that been in the
[1:09] past you don't ever want to come back
[1:12] but
[1:13] uh Susan said it was
[1:17] work and they laid out a day or two so I
[1:19] don't know where they
[1:23] went okay they were late a few days
[1:26] that's what it was they were late and
[1:28] when you're late for a meal you're
[1:30] you're just late you miss a meal you're
[1:33] just you're just late but but thank you
[1:36] for your generosity in the past 3 years
[1:39] you know it's really it wouldn't have
[1:40] happened without this church paying for
[1:44] the food for those of you that are new
[1:45] that don't know anything about it every
[1:48] year brother berley Williams has a camp
[1:50] for the children and it started with 40
[1:52] or 50 and then it's got up to now 125 to
[1:55] 150 kids and June and myself have took
[1:58] the burden on cooking
[2:00] for every meal for which is four meals a
[2:02] day and usually it started on Thursday
[2:05] Friday Saturday and Sunday now they're
[2:06] only going to start it on Friday
[2:08] Saturday and Sunday because of a camp
[2:10] schedule a guy scheduled the camp to run
[2:13] till Thursday and it knocked us out a
[2:15] day which was not because of
[2:17] participation it was because the guy
[2:18] didn't know what to schedule so it's
[2:21] just going to be Friday Saturday and
[2:23] Sunday morning but uh in the past we had
[2:27] as a church not out of the church funds
[2:29] but out of your pocket in our pocket in
[2:32] our time we have give money or give food
[2:36] or make cookies or cakes to to uh help
[2:40] brother Burley because without that
[2:44] um to be honest with he couldn't have a
[2:47] camp because it would cost3 or
[2:50] $4,000 extra if you put ta the food bill
[2:53] on to what he charges the people and we
[2:57] do that for free as a church
[3:00] so and uh the people really enjoy it and
[3:03] they know that that it comes from the
[3:05] people not from the spoken word church
[3:07] we could have funded the whole thing but
[3:09] it comes from the people it comes from
[3:11] you brothers and sisters you know it's
[3:13] like you always say we got plenty of
[3:15] money it's just in your
[3:16] pocket so you can get it out like I said
[3:20] about brother dicks his is folded up for
[3:22] so long when you open it up it just fold
[3:24] right back
[3:28] again they everybody's been generous I'm
[3:31] just asking you it's now like 17 weeks
[3:33] away so I know everything's tight and
[3:36] money's tight but it just every little
[3:38] bit will help you know put up $5 a week
[3:41] put it in an envelope and you know 10
[3:44] weeks from now guess what she got 50
[3:45] bucks and then you can hand that over to
[3:48] us and we will absolutely take every
[3:50] dime of it and put it toward uh good
[3:54] food for the camp and the ones that's
[3:56] been there it's been an experience Janet
[3:58] and Boyd got to go with us and and uh um
[4:01] sister Rebecca got to go and brother Joe
[4:04] and sister Glenn's always been there
[4:05] with us so we have a lot of fun it's
[4:08] tiring it's never
[4:10] boring but just keep that in your heart
[4:12] it'll be the last weekend in July is
[4:14] when we'll have the camp and we will get
[4:16] all the uh all the um I think June and
[4:19] sister gw's worked on the on the menu to
[4:22] get it together and uh and brother
[4:25] Donnie and sister Susan got to go with
[4:27] us last year so they it was a treat for
[4:29] them so if anybody wants to just jump on
[4:30] in you can go with
[4:32] us
[4:35] Bob it's work it is it's work is it I
[4:39] mean it's work but you know what we do
[4:40] it for the kids and they know that they
[4:43] know that's our ministry to them and
[4:45] they're very appreciative because what
[4:47] they tell us they told us they said this
[4:49] ain't camp food we don't cook them camp
[4:50] food we cook them good food that's right
[4:53] but it's all because of what you give
[4:55] and we appreciate it that you do that
[4:56] again this year okay Lord bless you
[5:01] he's 32 in
[5:03] them back when I back when I was young
[5:06] they used to tell it around I never did
[5:08] hear it much cuz I can't remember back
[5:10] that
[5:12] far but they always said I was going to
[5:14] be a lawyer cuz I always said why why
[5:17] why and all that you know and if things
[5:19] just run over in my mind and I can't
[5:21] remember them as long as normal but my
[5:25] first question is what's the difference
[5:27] and the money doesn't come out of the
[5:29] church but it comes out of our
[5:31] pockets right you know same money and
[5:36] special
[5:38] education see you got mentally
[5:40] challenged children but on the other end
[5:43] you got Brother Gary and myself which

[5:54] way we're not going to do this right

[19:49] to uh get to a place you know to have a
[19:53] better understanding so it'll be if
[19:55] Genesis 1:26 and 27 and Psalms
[20:01] 885 Psalms

[20:12] we do enjoy ourselves so that's that's
[20:15] all right we have a good time in the
[20:17] Lord and maybe they can enjoy it too I
[20:19] don't see why the Christians can't be
[20:21] happy you know I am I'm I'm very happy
[20:24] about the Lord and his doings and it
[20:27] makes me very happy in all things amen

[21:47] everything up and keeps up with what
[21:49] we're doing he has to keep me straight A
[21:51] lot of times cuz I get the wrong numbers
[21:53] on my messages and I preach so many on
[21:56] one thing until some times I just keep
[21:58] repeating the number you know but that's
[22:00] all right we we we try to stay together
[22:03] okay Genesis 1 126 and 27 in Psalms
[22:08] 85 Heavenly Father our Lord Our Savior
[22:11] Our Redeemer our All In All In Jesus is
[22:14] your name thank you for all things Lord
[22:18] you said you give them to us freely so
[22:20] then Lord help us to be able to receive
[22:22] them and we just ask you now that you'd
[22:24] come on the scene this afternoon and
[22:26] speak to our hearts and our our lives
[22:28] and help us to rejoice in
[22:31] you and Lord to see
[22:34] you the author and finisher of our
[22:37] faith Lord Just Have Your Way bless
[22:40] those that are sick the ones that are
[22:41] not with us the to sin sick Lord you
[22:44] promised it and we believe you CU you
[22:47] said in your word that you sent your
[22:49] word and healed us and delivered us from
[22:51] destruction so if something is
[22:53] destroying us then we can depend on your
[22:55] word we can depend on you Lord just have
[22:58] your way now and guide us and forgive
[23:00] our sins because we want to stand
[23:02] complete in you and lead us in thine
[23:05] understanding in Jesus name
[23:09] amen Genesis 1:26 and
[23:12] 27
[23:14] well see if we can tie these two
[23:16] scriptures together this afternoon
[23:19] because we'll go from there to Psalms 85
[23:21] all
[23:22] right and God said let us make man in
[23:25] our image after our light and let them
[23:28] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[23:30] and over the foul of the A and over the
[23:32] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[23:34] ever creeping thing that creepeth upon
[23:36] the Earth so God created man in his own
[23:40] image in the image of God created he him
[23:43] male and female created he them right
[23:48] now go to Psalms 85 and notice the
[23:52] reading of what the psalmist is is
[23:56] saying
[24:00] Psalms
[24:01] 85
[24:03] Lord thou has been favorable unto thy
[24:06] land thou has brought back the Captivity
[24:09] of
[24:10] Jacob now watch these are Naturals and
[24:13] then it'll come
[24:14] over thou has forgiven the iniquity of
[24:17] thy people thou has covered all their
[24:20] sin the blood atonement can take care of
[24:24] things thou has taken away all thy Wrath
[24:28] thou H has turned thyself from the
[24:29] fierceness of thine
[24:31] anger that was a promise to
[24:34] Abraham I'm just trying to get you get a
[24:36] point as we go along
[24:38] okay turn us oh god of our salvation and
[24:42] cause thine anger toward us to
[24:46] cease will thou be angry with us
[24:50] forever even though he made the promise
[24:52] to Abraham they still a problem
[24:55] right right right
[24:58] even though the promise was made to
[24:59] Abraham is still a prophet right all
[25:01] right wil thou be angry with us forever
[25:04] Willl thou draw out thine anger to all
[25:07] generations will thou not revive us
[25:10] again that thy people may rejoice in
[25:13] thee show us thy mercy O Lord and grant
[25:17] us thy
[25:19] salvation now listen I will hear what
[25:22] the Lord will
[25:24] speak for he will speak peace unto his
[25:27] people
[25:28] and to his
[25:29] Saints but let them not turn again to
[25:34] Folly surely his salvation is nigh to
[25:37] them n them that fear Him That Glory May
[25:41] dwell in our land mercy and Truth are
[25:44] met together righteousness and peace
[25:46] have kissed each other truth shall
[25:48] spring out of the earth and
[25:50] righteousness shall down from heaven yay
[25:53] the Lord shall give that which is good
[25:56] and our land shall yield her Increase
[25:59] righteousness shall go before him and
[26:02] she shall shall set us in the way of his
[26:06] steps you may be seated the Lord had his
[26:08] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[26:10] these are a few got these go out and
[26:14] these are about 10 copies of where we
[26:16] pick up from so if anybody didn't get
[26:18] this mornings anybody didn't get this
[26:20] mornings get them from Brother Don there
[26:23] I just ran some because we're going to
[26:25] have to jump with two parts on one
[26:28] message okay I didn't get through this
[26:30] morning so I chose not to repeat a lot
[26:35] because I believe you got the point but
[26:37] we will cover what we have to and then
[26:41] we will uh use part notes from the
[26:44] morning message and some that we had in
[26:46] for this
[26:47] afternoon
[26:51] now I hope you was understanding what I
[26:53] was been trying to bring about you know
[26:56] the soul of an
[26:58] individual but I believe your soul is
[27:01] the real
[27:02] you I believe it's greater than your
[27:05] body amen is greater than your spirit
[27:08] part of you amen because it's the real
[27:11] you it is the part that God chose to
[27:15] make in His
[27:17] image and in creating It In His Image we
[27:22] know what the image of God is he is a
[27:24] spiritual being so what did he create in
[27:27] the Garden there you know we're created
[27:29] there as we call it in the garden but
[27:32] before the foundation of the world he
[27:35] created a spiritual
[27:39] man and that spiritual man is called the
[27:43] theop the Loos the things of the order
[27:46] of the Prophet is doing and and there
[27:49] stood almighty
[27:51] God in a form called the theoy called
[27:55] the son of God the Loos the as the
[27:59] prophet said like a child playing before
[28:02] the father's
[28:03] door and he begins to say Let There be
[28:06] you know and his first creation we know
[28:10] from Brother random was what was angels
[28:13] and they worshiped him and that made him
[28:15] God all right somewhere prior to
[28:19] that existence of that
[28:23] part which is before the foundation of
[28:25] the
[28:26] world the prophet of God said
[28:30] that that
[28:32] theophany
[28:35] man was
[28:37] created right so we can see that he
[28:40] stood out and he said this morning he
[28:41] said Let There Be Right the world and
[28:45] things begin to come into being now I
[28:48] don't believe in but one Eternal God
[28:53] Amen it's impossible to have more than
[28:55] one God because you you would mess up up
[28:57] see because there's only one that can be
[28:59] Eternal and your great doctrine of the
[29:02] denominations like the Baptist Etc say
[29:05] that it's God in three persons co-equal
[29:07] and co-eternal now how can that be right
[29:10] how can you be co-equal and co-eternal
[29:12] and yet being a son all right see in
[29:16] that those things are are
[29:20] incorrect but see
[29:22] God stood there and created the world
[29:26] and all the things and created all of it
[29:28] and then he created a man in his own
[29:29] image right all right and that man was a
[29:34] one many member bodied man is the best
[29:38] way that I can describe
[29:41] it and in doing that we'll get to it
[29:43] eventually that it'll come down to the
[29:45] body of
[29:46] Christ being a one membered I mean one
[29:49] many membered body called The Bride of
[29:53] Jesus Christ all right but yet I'm
[29:56] wanting to hold a point to where we can
[29:58] look at it and see that that that Soul
[30:02] being the real
[30:04] you and even in its Fallen
[30:08] estate it is so real until the body can
[30:11] be just throwed out on the
[30:14] ground you know and rock right but yet
[30:18] God Made A
[30:20] Way and his great plan to have a place
[30:25] for every person that would ever be a
[30:27] living Soul that's right to go to Y to
[30:32] abide there for the
[30:35] time and to those that are not saved it
[30:38] would be called a Celestial body theoy
[30:42] right because it means a
[30:44] body all right and it can be it will be
[30:48] a place and it is the the uh Fifth
[30:51] Dimension where the center dead are at
[30:54] there's a place to abide and then all
[30:58] you know there is another place that has
[31:00] the prophet said that's going downward
[31:02] there's another place that's going
[31:04] upward soever born again
[31:06] Christian then would have a place that
[31:09] they would go
[31:10] to if they pass on right and that would
[31:14] be called Souls under the altar now not
[31:17] to say how long how long to avenge our
[31:19] blood but see the brother random is so
[31:22] specific till he can divide a point
[31:23] right down the line and we run ourselves
[31:26] crazy trying to understand but be
[31:29] careful and watch what he says the fifth
[31:31] seal Jew says be says how long how long
[31:34] to avenge our blood but the souls under
[31:36] the altar the angel of the Lord referred
[31:39] to it as calling it Souls under the
[31:41] altar saying how long how
[31:44] long that's how close it is that is the
[31:47] bride of Christ that has passed on and
[31:49] they had a place to go to in that place
[31:52] is their
[31:54] theophany which is your soul but but I
[31:57] believe ever born again believer your
[31:59] soul then is your
[32:01] theophany dwelling in you now I know and
[32:05] we will take it up the Lord willing
[32:06] Wednesday to go further into the depth
[32:09] of it I know what is taught basically by
[32:12] quote the people of the message from
[32:14] what brother brandham says about that uh
[32:17] your theophany is in
[32:21] heaven you know waiting for
[32:24] you well I if I was you I'd go read that
[32:27] scripture in 1 Corinthians 51 and if
[32:30] you'll notice very carefully the reading
[32:33] of the
[32:33] scriptures if this Earthly Tabernacle
[32:36] were that's two questions one is asking
[32:39] you a question the other one is stating
[32:41] something as a future Point were but it
[32:45] the point I want you to see is it says
[32:47] that it's Eternal in the heavens right
[32:51] all right now we might have believ Mom
[32:54] and Daddy or preacher so and so or
[32:56] whatever his name was or whoever we
[32:58] going to talk about and believe that one
[33:01] day we good bad disbelief you know that
[33:04] well we we don't really know for certain
[33:07] but one day we're going to go to heaven
[33:09] and be
[33:12] Eternal well that was all right for
[33:14] today's gone by right this is the time
[33:17] not to think about going to heaven to
[33:19] become Eternal but to think about heaven
[33:21] coming here to make us Eternal amen all
[33:23] right right so we're in a different time
[33:27] they had their day they had their times
[33:29] and their thoughts and God winked at to
[33:31] ignorance but now he commands us to
[33:33] believe his word all right so then I'm
[33:36] not talking about eternity somewhere
[33:38] else I'm talking about eternal life in
[33:39] your soul by the new birth all right and
[33:43] that way then your soul is your
[33:44] theophany you say well well what about
[33:47] well then do you have eternal life
[33:50] amen right if you have eternal life
[33:53] dwelling in you then that's exactly why
[33:55] it stated because if it's beyond the
[33:57] curtain of time it's eternal
[34:02] life all right and you have one Eternal
[34:06] in the
[34:07] heavens so is you got two
[34:10] eternals we read a quote there this
[34:12] morning from the prophet or gave where
[34:14] he said you don't believe in two Eternal
[34:15] lives do you he said that'd be hard to
[34:18] explain or that is hard to explain cuz
[34:20] there's only one Eternal and that's God
[34:23] Amen all right that's why we need the
[34:25] new birth amen we need God's own life to
[34:27] come and live in
[34:29] us all right and that was the point I
[34:31] was trying to get us to see this morning
[34:33] see there was
[34:36] Adam created Body Spirit and soul of man
[34:41] and then God breed in his nostrils the
[34:43] breath of eternal life
[34:46] right they never done it to anybody else
[34:49] right down through there because
[34:50] everybody born after
[34:52] then received natural
[34:55] life all right he's so specific on
[34:58] Blasphemous names he said said
[35:00] especially don't use the word especially
[35:03] it won't come up on your computer he say
[35:04] especially into Adam the breath of
[35:08] eternal life he said not what nature
[35:11] done right so we look at nature and we
[35:14] say Well when the baby's born nature
[35:16] gives you a soul what is
[35:19] nature anybody want to describe nature I
[35:23] thought there was only one nature and
[35:24] that was God and I thought there was
[35:25] only one that could create a
[35:27] soul now and doing that then let's get
[35:30] on to a point see that part of you
[35:33] that's real is what God is working on
[35:36] right he's not working on your body to
[35:39] try to save your body that will be taken
[35:41] care of in this end time message by the
[35:44] the the the thing that we still on
[35:46] Ephesians that you're
[35:49] predestinated in this day to adoption
[35:52] right all right this is the only age
[35:54] it's predestinated to a change of the
[35:57] body all right see we're in the age that
[36:00] that's to predestinate and I thought we
[36:02] believe that the word of God came
[36:04] predestinated eternally right so it's
[36:06] going to happen in this age somebody's
[36:08] going to be changed because God
[36:10] predetermined it right he predetermined
[36:13] in the days of Martin Luther that man
[36:15] would stand there and preach the just
[36:17] shall live by faith he done it that's
[36:20] right the man wouldn't predestinate
[36:22] eternally but the word
[36:25] was we're destinated to come to that
[36:28] place of eternal life right here okay
[36:30] amen now see then I believe your soul is
[36:33] your
[36:35] theophany that's right if you're a
[36:37] sinner it's a place to go to your soul
[36:41] it will go
[36:42] somewhere the prophet covered that Jesus
[36:45] went and preached to the soul that was
[36:47] in prison that's right and he saw the
[36:51] people he could describe what they look
[36:52] like he saw the women out there in the
[36:55] the uh pennies coming up and he said
[36:57] that was exactly the same ones he saw in
[36:59] Hell right the
[37:02] people the soul of an individual is not
[37:05] just a spooky float around you know
[37:08] we're beyond that even your Prophet
[37:12] thought in his early life
[37:14] that he said what would it be like he
[37:18] said I could see brother Neville but he
[37:21] said I couldn't shake his hand he said
[37:23] because his hands would be in the grave
[37:27] but he said now through when he went
[37:29] beyond the curtain of time he come back
[37:31] he saw what it was right so then it come
[37:34] out to the right place see now there's
[37:36] only one eternal life amen all
[37:40] right I don't ask you to say Amen
[37:43] because you might want to say ohe me the
[37:45] next statement I make all right so just
[37:48] you agree yourself until do what you
[37:50] want to but see there's only one eternal
[37:53] life then there's only one eternal
[37:55] theophany amen
[37:58] right there's never been 10 50 100 milon
[38:01] whatever no no there's never been but
[38:03] one Eternal
[38:04] theophany if we're not a part of God's
[38:06] own life within us by the new birth we
[38:09] do not have eternal life I don't care
[38:11] what we think what we claim how we
[38:13] holler we believe the message that we do
[38:15] all of these things all of that is well
[38:17] and
[38:19] good but eternal life is the thing I'm
[38:21] concerned with if I make you mad in body
[38:26] you know your spiritual being because
[38:28] that I am so Stern about what I think
[38:30] I'm sorry I don't want to be but there's
[38:33] one thing about it the Bible says them
[38:36] that watch after your souls amen I'm
[38:40] concerned with your soul you get mad at
[38:42] me you leave you do what you want to
[38:45] that's between you and your God that's
[38:47] right but I'm going to try my best to
[38:50] preach salvation to you and I to deliver
[38:53] us amen amen and to bring about a change
[38:56] of the body
[38:57] all right that's as much as I can say
[38:59] all right we covered this morning that
[39:02] before we could have eternal life before
[39:05] Adam had eternal life God had to breathe
[39:09] into Adam eternal life right go to
[39:13] blasphemian 9 27 I gave it to you this
[39:16] morning it's on your notes 27 and don't
[39:18] I'm not going to read it now so don't go
[39:19] to it to read it now but go read them
[39:22] when you get a
[39:24] change that
[39:27] we are right a tri being Body Spirit and
[39:31] soul but the soul was the part that was
[39:34] created in the image of God right that's
[39:38] right not the body it was created in the
[39:40] image of animal right yep there Adam was
[39:43] standing being there in the the garden
[39:47] and he had eternal life in his soul
[39:50] because God placed into Adam a part of
[39:55] that Genesis 126 and 27 man that's right
[40:00] which to me that Genesis 126 let's see
[40:02] if you can get this
[40:04] and that Genesis 126 and 27
[40:09] man wouldn't the creation of God right
[40:14] it's God
[40:15] amen
[40:18] amen now swallow real
[40:22] good you
[40:25] awake okay so Genesis 1 126 and 27 would
[40:29] be the same logos theophany that came
[40:31] out of the out of God in the beginning
[40:33] amen absolutely or else you got two
[40:36] theop that's
[40:38] right yes but brother Dale you mean you
[40:41] going to bring it down to that eternal
[40:43] life in you and I is right exactly where
[40:45] I'm going to bring it that eternal life
[40:47] that's in us with the eternal life that
[40:49] stood in the garden and created the
[40:51] world now you tell me there's two or
[40:53] three Eternal lives and I'll tell you
[40:55] that you got a problem
[40:57] mainly between your ears all right see
[41:00] but what happened to
[41:03] Adam God breeded into Adam or put into
[41:06] Adam part
[41:09] right see of his own life and the reason
[41:13] I said part is like I tried to explain
[41:14] it this morning
[41:18] Moses you got too much trouble
[41:21] Moses take off and let somebody else
[41:23] have a part of it took the spirit off of
[41:26] Moses and put it on 70 and it left Moses
[41:30] with no less
[41:31] Spirit that's what your Prophet said
[41:35] every person in the world today could
[41:37] receive eternal life if they would and
[41:41] you know that God wouldn't be no smaller
[41:43] God would be greater that's
[41:46] right because that's what he wants Adam
[41:49] in the garden remember this morning was
[41:51] what Adam in the garden is what God
[41:54] wants of all his children
[41:56] here on Earth
[41:59] amen a man standing there that his body
[42:02] was not
[42:04] Eternal his Spirit was a creation from
[42:07] God permitted the prophet said in the
[42:09] situation brought into to the
[42:12] man and a soul that had been made
[42:15] Eternal amen by the very Breath of God
[42:19] now I don't have time to get it we'll
[42:21] get to it bring it back to you but on
[42:23] Blasphemous names right in our close to
[42:26] where you're reading with your notes if
[42:28] you'll keep reading you'll find brother
[42:30] brandham saying that the Church of the
[42:32] Living God is born by the Breath of God
[42:35] right amen right right right amen and he
[42:40] gives the scripture there where Jesus
[42:42] breathed on him and said receive ye the
[42:44] Holy Ghost he said Church born by the
[42:47] Breath of God they asked him the
[42:49] question about
[42:53] it in other words did those people get
[42:55] that eternal life right there when Jesus
[42:57] breathed on he said no it was a promise
[43:01] they got it on the day of
[43:03] Pentecost it was a promise right there
[43:06] you and I are promised and listen I know
[43:08] how far that goes too cuz I know on down
[43:10] on the page you keep reading and you'll
[43:13] find see when this church is molded up
[43:16] into the
[43:19] image statue of perfect
[43:21] man he said God will breathe upon upon
[43:25] that church
[43:27] by the Breath of God I'm looking further
[43:29] forward to that when all of us come to
[43:32] the adoption and The Headstone God will
[43:34] breathe upon the bride again and she'll
[43:36] be changed that's right because it'll
[43:38] bring eternal life into being okay
[43:42] now but there Adam was in the garden and
[43:46] even being part of God in his
[43:49] soul and even Eve brother brand said
[43:51] they were same in theoy so you can argue
[43:54] all you want to
[43:56] but Eve was a person amen and God gave
[44:03] her eternal life amen in her soul also
[44:07] you so we don't have a quote for that I
[44:09] got enough for brother randam said she
[44:11] was in adamant theophany right so if
[44:14] Adam had Eternal theophany she had one
[44:17] too it was just a division but when she
[44:19] was taken from him and put in
[44:23] flesh then the fall could come right y
[44:27] but you know Adam fell
[44:29] amen now didn't fall to death as a
[44:33] eternally taken away or taking away of
[44:35] the eternal life from his soul he fell
[44:37] to Natural
[44:38] death if I die today are you going to
[44:41] say that I'm dead that I fell from
[44:43] eternal
[44:44] life I hope you don't think that way cuz
[44:46] I wouldn't say it about you I would say
[44:49] your soul is beyond the curtain of time
[44:51] Eternal waiting on a time to come back
[44:53] to the body see and that's what happen
[44:56] happened to Adam and Eve in the garden
[44:58] but nobody could be born and I'm trying
[45:00] to hurry up now nobody could be born
[45:02] then like they were in their
[45:06] creation something had to
[45:09] happen they could man could be led of
[45:12] God man through the Old Testament he
[45:16] could be so anointed until David would
[45:19] go out and and just you know kill a bar
[45:23] and and kill a a line and and and kill a
[45:26] giant because of the anointing on him
[45:30] but yet he could turn right back around
[45:32] and go to the bed of basba right and
[45:34] commit adultery with his one of his 30
[45:36] mighty men that would would give his own
[45:39] life for him right he could do that why
[45:42] because he was not born again right
[45:45] there was no way for the soul of man I
[45:48] mean the soul of an individual a person
[45:50] anybody back there could come to eternal
[45:52] life
[45:53] right the animal life could could only
[45:56] cover right because there was no soul in
[45:59] the animal life all right we something
[46:03] had to take place
[46:05] though all
[46:07] right eternal life would have to come
[46:10] into a human
[46:13] being and that human being would have to
[46:16] give his own life
[46:19] right it was not enough for the
[46:22] anointing to come on Jesus on the River
[46:24] Jordan and go off of him in the Garden
[46:27] of Gethsemane that could not bring you
[46:28] eternal life as we were talking about
[46:30] last night of mzc mzc could not give you
[46:34] eternal life I believe the
[46:37] mzd inside of that man that ate the calf
[46:41] as we said this morning I believe that
[46:43] was eternal life amen CU brother R said
[46:45] that's almighty
[46:48] God had no beginning and no ended I
[46:50] believe that but there was no way to
[46:52] release that life to get it to come back
[46:55] so then had to wait until a time that a
[46:58] baby could be born upon this
[47:00] Earth and that baby would be born
[47:03] almighty God not born as men are
[47:06] teaching today that he was born just a
[47:07] man and then he becomes God on the River
[47:10] Jordan no the Bible said he was born
[47:13] Lord the Christ the Bible says Emmanuel
[47:16] God With Us the prophet said your God
[47:19] with no teeth laying in a cradle that's
[47:23] how he would describe you
[47:26] why because it was almighty God laying
[47:28] there
[47:29] amen he came became anointed on the
[47:32] River Jordan for the ministry that he
[47:34] was to carry wonderful am a great event
[47:38] took place that's right but then that
[47:40] anointing would have to leave him in the
[47:42] garden because there was no way for him
[47:44] to die without anointing on him
[47:46] right see they couldn't touch him he
[47:49] could just walk right out of the crowd
[47:51] they were ready to Stone him right he
[47:53] just turned walk out there's nothing
[47:55] that could do with him until that
[47:56] anointing left him but that anointing
[47:59] didn't take his soul out right that
[48:02] anointing didn't take the spirit out of
[48:04] him cuz he said on the on the cross into
[48:07] thy hand I commend my
[48:09] spirit that's right he cried out my
[48:12] soul lord into thy hand I commend
[48:17] you see a man had to come that would be
[48:22] as I said at the ending this morning
[48:24] then ody Jesus was is my brother but
[48:27] he's My
[48:29] Kinsman y but you better remember you
[48:32] was born with one more kin to you than
[48:34] Jesus Christ you was born kin folks to
[48:38] the devil according to the Book of Ruth
[48:39] and the prophet's message C the message
[48:42] of Grace you better go back and study
[48:45] the message study the Book of Ruth there
[48:47] was one more kin folks to
[48:49] Ruth than Boaz was he had to offer him a
[48:53] chance to redeem but he ref refused it
[48:56] cuz he was the devil and the devil can't
[48:58] cast out a devil to do you try to make
[49:00] you a Christian so he had to refuse it
[49:04] then Boaz could come forth to be the
[49:06] kinsman redeemer so body to body he's my
[49:09] brother body to body He's My Kinsman
[49:12] right Spirit to Spirit as I said this
[49:14] morning he can anoint me and not great
[49:17] things can take
[49:20] place you can see Visions you can see
[49:23] things happen you can see the sick
[49:25] healed and dead raised you can see all
[49:27] kind of things under that anointing but
[49:30] under that anointing that can fall upon
[49:32] anointed ones as well and and that
[49:35] doesn't mean you got to be a Christian
[49:36] for it to work on you right I want to
[49:39] say
[49:40] something right
[49:45] here uh about 7:30 yesterday
[49:52] morning it
[49:54] happened blisten
[49:56] I I'm not a nervous person I've never
[49:58] been
[49:59] one and I come here I'm no more nervous
[50:02] than it would be it doesn't matter me if
[50:04] it's two people or 10,000 it don't
[50:06] change a bit that's right what people
[50:08] don't understand about me they say but
[50:09] I'm just so nervous I know that's your
[50:12] makeup but when every once in a while
[50:14] something happens and I get real
[50:17] nervous so somewh along about 7:30 might
[50:21] have been closer to 8 or closer to
[50:24] 7:00 I become I'm real real
[50:28] nervous and I just stop and pray because
[50:31] I'm not spiritual enough to know what's
[50:34] going on I'm just spiritual enough to
[50:35] know something's going on somewhere so
[50:38] then I stop and pray so what you know it
[50:40] happens that way every once in a while
[50:43] but you know that's part of my life and
[50:47] doings all right but listen that
[50:49] anointing can be there when you're a
[50:50] sinner too like that sure that's right
[50:53] so don't make it you you're Christian
[50:55] cuz that's an anointing no cuz anointing
[50:58] can be on your spirit you can have the
[50:59] baptism brother Brandon said genuine
[51:02] baptism of the Holy Spirit on your
[51:05] spirit and still be lost y amen so then
[51:10] body to body he's my brother Spirit to
[51:13] Spirit he can anoint but he can
[51:15] anoint all these others to do their
[51:18] things he anointed Benny hen and he
[51:21] walked right off the platform right out
[51:22] in mid iron turn around walk back you
[51:24] deny it how
[51:28] no but see then they soul to soul that's
[51:32] all I want to deal with right cuz God
[51:34] ain't trying to save my body that'll be
[51:37] taken care of he ain't trying to save my
[51:39] spirit he's trying to save my soul amen
[51:41] he's trying to deal with your soul to
[51:44] get you to stand still long enough to
[51:45] listen to him
[51:47] amen and let him talk to you that's
[51:50] right because that Soul no matter what
[51:52] you think about it it's born in the
[51:55] image image of almighty God right even
[51:57] in a lost condition that still Longs for
[52:00] a savior still worships right all right
[52:04] so then it's body to body Spirit to
[52:06] Spirit soul to soul am the soul is the
[52:09] thing God is dealing with now
[52:11] amen it will come to the point of the
[52:14] the spirit in the body later on all
[52:16] right but to do that God would have to
[52:18] make a way that his children could be
[52:21] able to come to the place of
[52:23] Salvation all right
[52:26] you could cover a lot of things about
[52:28] what it would be and whatever it is but
[52:31] let's just take something there in that
[52:32] scripture have you ever really just
[52:34] studied the
[52:36] Psalms look back at
[52:39] it Psalms 85 have you ever just really
[52:42] you know got into that this message goes
[52:45] back brother Mo preached it about
[52:46] probably 1971 or might even before then
[52:50] you know and it really thrilled my soul
[52:52] and and it still Thrills me you know to
[52:56] think about
[52:57] it but see the psalmist David is
[52:59] describing as I
[53:02] said that God has made a way
[53:06] right by the time this had taken place
[53:11] the they were probably in natural
[53:14] captivity maybe I don't know if that
[53:17] point there but he said he brought them
[53:22] back he's forgiven the iniquity
[53:26] right cuz he gave away for the iniquity
[53:28] to be covered of the people and he
[53:30] covered their sin that was the blood of
[53:32] bulls and
[53:34] goats it could cover sin but it could
[53:37] not eradicate it right all right so then
[53:40] not being able to eradicate it he could
[53:42] take away verse
[53:44] three the
[53:47] Wrath the blood atonement of the animal
[53:50] would cover the man to where the wrath
[53:52] of God would be turned away
[53:56] are you following me under the blood of
[53:57] bulls and goats the wrath of of God
[53:59] would be turned away and he turned from
[54:02] his fierceness of
[54:05] destroying I remember there in the Bible
[54:07] you know he was he was fixing to kill a
[54:09] bunch of them and and Moses said Aaron
[54:11] grab your sensor and run among the
[54:13] people and preventure you might be able
[54:14] to make an atonement right and you know
[54:17] that God seen
[54:19] that the way done and run through there
[54:22] that sensor and they do and you know
[54:24] what it turned his rth
[54:25] right y he turned
[54:28] away I remember I used to preach off of
[54:30] it you find 10 times from the time the
[54:32] children of Israel left Egypt to the
[54:35] when they come to Cades barnea and God
[54:38] said 10 times you sinned against me Shy
[54:40] destroyed thousands of them and the
[54:42] doings and all kind of things but he was
[54:44] still ready to take them to the promised
[54:46] land but when they got there and
[54:49] wouldn't believe Joshua and Caleb
[54:52] right that was as far as God was going
[54:55] to go he said to the Wilderness you go
[54:58] until all of you that it C tith in this
[55:01] Doctrine right are going to die so you
[55:06] look at it in the message of the hour
[55:08] you'll see why we're here he has let us
[55:11] go this 40 years to be able to kill off
[55:13] all of
[55:15] those that's all see but they knows how
[55:18] to typ he just don't like to get you
[55:20] think I want I get arrogant you think I
[55:22] get
[55:24] hateful no I try to be real soft
[55:27] right cuz you could preach a long time
[55:29] about all this first meeting was in in
[55:33] Jeffersonville I come back around
[55:35] brother Mo I was just dying to laughing
[55:37] and he said what are you laughing about
[55:40] and we went to a ministers meeting that
[55:42] they were having up in the old uh voice
[55:44] of God recording that old building the
[55:46] uh Armory and uh you know he said what
[55:50] are you laughing about I said well I
[55:52] went over in this group and I was
[55:54] listening
[55:55] and I said over on this side was a bunch
[55:57] of old people of the message you know my
[56:01] age and different things you know and
[56:03] been in the message a while you know and
[56:05] and I said they were all
[56:08] typing that they were the Joshua and the
[56:12] Caleb that stayed with Moses but all
[56:16] these others is dying off because they
[56:20] wouldn't Joshua and Caleb I said left
[56:22] iron and went over and that's not no
[56:23] joke is happening
[56:25] went over the other group and I were all
[56:27] the young ones in the message you know
[56:30] come up and hav't seen the prophet you
[56:33] know they were typing and said all them
[56:36] old heads has got to die off cuz all of
[56:39] 20 Ag and over got to die you know and
[56:42] we're the young ones that's going into
[56:44] the
[56:45] land and I'm not joking it happened cuz
[56:48] that's what people
[56:50] thinks but you get the point of what I'm
[56:53] saying first four he says turn us oh god
[56:57] of our
[56:58] salvation and cause thine anger toward
[57:02] us to cease he could cease still no
[57:05] matter what if there was an atonement
[57:07] there was anger in God about Mankind
[57:11] because mankind was not in the place
[57:13] that it needs to
[57:15] be Willl thou verse 5 be angry with us
[57:19] forever or for forever will thou draw
[57:24] out thine anger to all
[57:27] generations Lord I'm pleading the Cause
[57:32] right some way find something that can
[57:34] take place to take away this from us and
[57:37] cause your anger to turn from us your
[57:40] fierceness Willl thou not revive us
[57:45] again that thy people may rejoice in
[57:49] thee he was concerned wasn't
[57:52] he show us thy mercy oh Lord and grant
[57:56] us thy
[57:57] salvation Lord come on the scene and
[58:00] make a way we can be
[58:02] saved David said Thy word have I hid in
[58:05] my heart but brother brandham said what
[58:08] he needed was the baptism of the Holy
[58:11] Ghost that would have kept him from that
[58:14] adultery all right
[58:17] listen I will hear what the Lord will
[58:23] speak right now the psalmist David is
[58:25] coming to a point he said I will
[58:28] hear where the psalmist here I get them
[58:31] mixed up whether it's David or or
[58:34] Solomon then you just put the right one
[58:36] in
[58:37] there I hear what I will hear what the
[58:39] Lord will speak for he will speak peace
[58:43] unto his people right and to his
[58:48] Saints but let them not turn again to
[58:51] Folly Lord do something that'll bring us
[58:53] to the place that we won't won't keep
[58:55] falling back in this garbage again that
[58:57] we do every time you take us out you
[58:59] kill off all the amorites we were
[59:01] talking about it last night in the Bible
[59:03] you know you ever noticed I believe it's
[59:04] the amorites you ever noticed in the
[59:06] Bible that he said destroy the amorites
[59:09] utterly destroy men women and children
[59:11] all they go out and Destroy every one of
[59:12] them two chapters later they're fighting
[59:14] amorites right where' they come from
[59:17] they you said well he growed up over
[59:20] there well that take a couple hundred
[59:21] years to bring up for enough no you know
[59:24] who d amorites are you know who I want
[59:26] to destroy I'm looking at it right the
[59:31] Amorite is the
[59:34] flesh you destroy it one day the next
[59:37] day it's going to come alive you put it
[59:39] down one day the next day it's going to
[59:41] lead you and carry you into the wrong
[59:44] place so that's the Amorite the Bible is
[59:46] trying to
[59:47] destroy all right so this
[59:53] one surely he his
[59:56] salvation is not them that fear Him That
[1:00:00] Glory May dwell in all our land now
[1:00:04] watch mercy and Truth are met
[1:00:09] together now where did that happen
[1:00:12] at right there's not but one place that
[1:00:15] that can take place and that's in Jesus
[1:00:18] Christ that's right amen the only one
[1:00:20] place that mercy and Truth can ever meet
[1:00:23] right the only way anybody can ever be
[1:00:25] saved is got to receive that one that
[1:00:28] was there that would be both mercy and
[1:00:31] truth right now listen what he said
[1:00:34] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[1:00:39] other when did that take place
[1:00:41] righteousness and peace kissed each
[1:00:45] other when God and man became one in
[1:00:48] Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ to make a way that we could be
[1:00:53] saved
[1:00:55] truth shall spring what out of the earth
[1:00:58] where's the message of the
[1:01:00] hour Earth where did the thunder sound
[1:01:03] the prophet said they sounded on Earth
[1:01:05] righteousness and
[1:01:07] peace shall look down and excuse me and
[1:01:10] righteousness shall look down from
[1:01:17] heaven verse 13 righteousness shall go
[1:01:20] before him and Shall Set us in the way
[1:01:23] of his steps
[1:01:28] the only place that God could ever meet
[1:01:31] man the only place he could ever put his
[1:01:34] name we were listening to that the other
[1:01:35] day on Prophet
[1:01:39] preaching what a wonderful thing took
[1:01:44] place the day A man was
[1:01:49] born right that could give his life amen
[1:01:52] we have the only religion that there is
[1:01:54] is that it was totally totally
[1:01:57] impossible for our leader to not die he
[1:02:01] had to
[1:02:04] die we're the only religion there is
[1:02:07] that demanded that our leader
[1:02:09] die to be able to give his life you've
[1:02:13] heard brother around talk about the the
[1:02:15] people you know and the mohammadans and
[1:02:16] the people would say you know well you
[1:02:19] said you give us this Muhammad said he'd
[1:02:21] give it to us
[1:02:22] yeah but you said see Muhammad didn't
[1:02:25] die he did finally cuz he got so
[1:02:29] old but he didn't die to give his life
[1:02:32] for the people right but Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] had to die that was the day
[1:02:38] righteousness and peace kissed each
[1:02:40] other let's read
[1:02:42] it lamb and a dove 1956 9
[1:02:47] 9117 and when he come down many people
[1:02:50] bypass this
[1:02:51] scripture now listen to it but to me
[1:02:55] it's one of the outstanding scriptures
[1:02:57] of the Bible that when Heaven and Earth
[1:03:00] embraced when God came down in the form
[1:03:03] of a dove and went upon his son in the
[1:03:06] form of a
[1:03:08] lamb now where did that take
[1:03:10] place to a completion upon the River
[1:03:13] Jordan right come
[1:03:16] on when God and Christ become
[1:03:21] one when God in Christ became one when
[1:03:24] the the Dove came down on the lamb
[1:03:27] Heaven and Earth kissed each other God
[1:03:28] and man was reconciled together why it's
[1:03:31] one of the greatest moments the world
[1:03:33] ever had that when man and God was
[1:03:35] reconciled together the lamb and a Dove
[1:03:38] came together Jesus did become there on
[1:03:42] the River Jordan the fullness of the
[1:03:43] godhead bodily right it wasn't that he
[1:03:47] wasn't God before them
[1:03:50] right but there was some part about God
[1:03:53] that had not come into manifestation
[1:03:55] upon
[1:03:58] Earth that man that we call Jesus and
[1:04:02] soul was almighty God your Prophet says
[1:04:06] right in
[1:04:07] spirit he he was God he said in body he
[1:04:11] said he was a
[1:04:13] man so they got to get they got to have
[1:04:15] some kind of a special Revelation you
[1:04:18] know to make everybody get to really
[1:04:20] feeling you know to touch you and make
[1:04:22] you happy about something
[1:04:24] instead of believing the truth the truth
[1:04:27] is what makes me happy right you better
[1:04:31] believe if I told you today and I called
[1:04:34] your name and I said Donnie
[1:04:36] fush I've got in my pocket a check for
[1:04:38] you for $1
[1:04:43] million what he
[1:04:49] say
[1:04:52] folks but I've got l and before me
[1:04:55] eternal life
[1:04:58] right the words of a prophet
[1:05:01] right the
[1:05:04] Bible eternal
[1:05:06] life what will we do with
[1:05:09] it Elisha the prophet 1956 10:02 in the
[1:05:13] evening now I'm just picking out part
[1:05:15] and I didn't have time to underline so
[1:05:16] you find it in the middle right about
[1:05:18] the middle he talks about God and his
[1:05:20] people he
[1:05:21] Tabernacle once in this pure under
[1:05:24] adulterated body of the Lord Jesus by
[1:05:27] virgin birth and that blood cell was
[1:05:29] broke and he made a way you couldn't do
[1:05:32] it you couldn't Merit it but he merited
[1:05:35] your rights and God after dwelling in
[1:05:39] Christ and giving himself as a ransom
[1:05:41] for reconciliation to bring man and God
[1:05:44] together and unite them together again
[1:05:46] when the lamb and Dove came together
[1:05:48] Heaven and Earth kissed Earth kissed man
[1:05:51] and God was reconciled that's what job
[1:05:55] wanted that's right y job said I would
[1:05:58] that some man could take my
[1:06:02] hand and the Hand of almighty God
[1:06:06] right the greatest wisdom man of all
[1:06:09] kind and said be able to bring them
[1:06:14] together that's exactly what happened in

[1:10:16] on the lamb Heaven and Earth embraced
[1:10:18] each other and kissed and Sinners and
[1:10:20] God was
[1:10:22] reconciled
[1:10:24] one more lamb and a dove 1960
[1:10:28] 805 oh what a confirmation to see a lamb
[1:10:31] and a dove come together Heaven and
[1:10:32] Earth United God and man united and one
[1:10:36] of the sins of the world was kissed
[1:10:40] away think and one of the the sins of
[1:10:44] the world was kissed away and all the
[1:10:47] roughness and all Death and All sorrow
[1:10:49] and all sickness was kissed away when
[1:10:51] the lamb and the dove become United
[1:10:53] together
[1:10:54] and do the same thing in you and it
[1:10:56] unites with you when the lamb and the
[1:10:58] dove comes together their Natures are
[1:11:00] the same all right
[1:11:04] now like I said people believe that
[1:11:07] being the River Jordan that Jesus
[1:11:09] wouldn't God until the River Jordan and
[1:11:11] then all once he become God and then God
[1:11:14] left him in the garden so who was

[1:11:54] with this anointing on him then it left
[1:11:56] him and then he was just a matter of
[1:11:57] just a few days probably from The Garden

[1:13:58] service if you got the evening service
[1:14:00] notes go to number 10 all right which is

[1:14:16] Pieces it cost for you and I to have
[1:14:19] eternal life it cost the death of the
[1:14:23] Lord Jesus
[1:14:26] Christ a body that was beaten as the
[1:14:29] scripture says we didn't even want to
[1:14:30] look on brother brandham said he looked
[1:14:33] like a piece of hamburger
[1:14:35] meat if you've ever been seen this one
[1:14:38] of the what what is it where they show
[1:14:40] theion passion not down Atlanta now I'm
[1:14:43] talking about the video and it shows
[1:14:45] where he would beat up and cut up and
[1:14:47] all kind of things with the cat of nine
[1:14:49] tails but around said he look like a
[1:14:51] piece of hamburger meat
[1:14:55] cuz the devil had his
[1:14:57] opportunity and he sure went at
[1:15:01] it but it took every bit of that to
[1:15:03] bring that life out of that body right
[1:15:06] but you know man didn't
[1:15:08] kill sir am the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:13] all of their beatings and all of the
[1:15:15] things Paul even I think how many five
[1:15:18] times or how many times was it three
[1:15:20] times that he was beat 40 save one which
[1:15:22] they said if he hit you 40 times he kill
[1:15:25] you we had 39 Stripes two or three times
[1:15:28] but they couldn't kill
[1:15:30] him cuz God went through with it
[1:15:36] right God gave his
[1:15:40] life man brother randam said did not
[1:15:44] kill Jesus Christ that's right he said
[1:15:47] he gave his life
[1:15:51] amen he paid the price that's right
[1:15:54] there the only way it could be done so
[1:15:56] what happened torn Riven to Pieces what
[1:15:59] his soul went to
[1:16:00] God God blessed him then his soul but
[1:16:04] returned back in the form of the baptism
[1:16:07] of the holy ghost that comes into every
[1:16:12] believer okay there's the only way to
[1:16:13] get eternal life there was that one
[1:16:17] theophany 126 Man Standing on Earth
[1:16:21] amen the full of the godhead bodily
[1:16:25] right the 126 man the one that created
[1:16:28] all things was standing on Earth amen
[1:16:32] Y and he gave his life so it could come
[1:16:35] back to me and you to do as I said to
[1:16:38] Adam give us each one part of his own
[1:16:40] life
[1:16:41] listen then his soul returned back in
[1:16:44] the form of the baptism of the holy
[1:16:45] ghost that comes into every believer to
[1:16:48] sanctify clean up the Mind clean up the
[1:16:50] heart and leave a portion of the Holy
[1:16:52] Ghost in there here and there and when
[1:16:54] the Holy Ghost is given out that same
[1:16:58] holy spirit that brought the body of
[1:17:00] Jesus Christ out of the Grave will
[1:17:05] Rapture and that Covenant has to doveet
[1:17:08] tail as he tore there and gave the body
[1:17:11] went back to God and the Spirit came
[1:17:13] back to the Earth then your spirit will
[1:17:15] have to be the same be the same kind of
[1:17:17] spirit or it'll miss that place going
[1:17:20] together amen yes sir not because you
[1:17:23] make yourself but because something the
[1:17:26] love of God has swept into your soul and
[1:17:28] tore ever Earthly Idol
[1:17:31] out see it wasn't just his death right
[1:17:35] it's got to be our death
[1:17:37] amen y we got to die to ourself to be
[1:17:41] born
[1:17:45] again unconditional Covenant 1954
[1:17:50] 306 watch God was then in Spirit how
[1:17:53] could God be torn apart but one day God
[1:17:56] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us how
[1:17:59] could it be done it in spirit couldn't
[1:18:01] do it the Lord Jesus Christ the Emmanuel
[1:18:05] and then there at Calvary the Covenant
[1:18:07] God wrote with us he took the Christ to
[1:18:10] Calvary and tore him apart soul and body
[1:18:13] and he took his body up to set at the
[1:18:14] right hand of his majesty and sent the
[1:18:17] soul back here or the spirit on the
[1:18:19] earth to make a covenant to carry out
[1:18:22] the gospel
[1:18:25] Perfection 1957 4:19 right down at the
[1:18:29] very bottom but God himself came that
[1:18:33] his own Spirit which is the highest line
[1:18:35] of spirit there is can come back by the
[1:18:38] form of the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:40] to the worshipper through the blood of
[1:18:42] Christ and take him into the body who
[1:18:47] was that Queen of Sheba
[1:18:50] 19610 but when the life that was in an
[1:18:53] animal that died the life could not come
[1:18:55] back and be a spirit with the human
[1:18:57] being because it was animal life without
[1:19:00] a soul but when Jesus died it was the
[1:19:03] soul was a soul of God right now look it
[1:19:07] was a soul of God he didn't say it was
[1:19:10] God he said it just a soul of
[1:19:18] God when that cell was broke it
[1:19:20] Sanctified the church that the Holy
[1:19:21] Spirit could live in us who were
[1:19:24] sexually born then it's God above us God
[1:19:26] With Us now it's God in us amen that's
[1:19:29] right so you see what I'm talking
[1:19:32] about heaven and earth kiss when God and
[1:19:35] man become one an opportunity to be able
[1:19:39] to relinquish the
[1:19:43] life the
[1:19:45] soul that it could come back Upon A a
[1:19:48] Believer and give that believer eternal
[1:19:51] life
[1:19:54] all right see then what is
[1:19:57] it ever born again
[1:20:00] believer every Born Again believer your
[1:20:03] soul is your
[1:20:05] theophany it has eternal life right
[1:20:09] right if has eternal life there's only
[1:20:11] one eternal life and that's God's own
[1:20:14] life that's right so then the Soul was
[1:20:17] divided on the day of Pentecost into 120
[1:20:21] amen the next time it happened it was
[1:20:25] 3,000 right and how many millions has
[1:20:28] come down through time and trillions or
[1:20:31] whatever that's right but it's still
[1:20:33] that
[1:20:34] one Eternal God that can give eternal
[1:20:38] life so if you have eternal life your
[1:20:42] soul is now your
[1:20:45] theophany because it's got an upward
[1:20:47] pull you said but I thought I had one in
[1:20:49] heaven waiting we'll get to that
[1:20:51] Wednesday because you better think about
[1:20:53] it right
[1:20:55] amen see because mankind has always
[1:20:58] wanted to go to heaven to get eternal
[1:20:59] life right that's right right
[1:21:03] amen cuz he don't just don't want to
[1:21:06] face up to it and to see that we must
[1:21:09] receive eternal life right here if we
[1:21:12] don't receive eternal life here there is
[1:21:14] no heaven to go to
[1:21:17] right because see the other notes that I
[1:21:20] got on the message is what I thought we
[1:21:24] believed we read where the Prophet
[1:21:27] said and the Bible says
[1:21:30] it that
[1:21:32] righteousness look down from
[1:21:36] heaven truth sprang up out of the earth
[1:21:39] amen I thought we believe by the new
[1:21:42] birth that we were resurrected according
[1:21:44] to the book of Ephesians that we were
[1:21:47] resurrected already now sitting in
[1:21:49] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I
[1:21:52] thought Heaven and Earth had come
[1:21:53] together right M that's right I thought
[1:21:57] Heaven and Earth was supposed to kissing
[1:21:59] you and me
[1:22:02] amen I thought that's what the new birth
[1:22:04] was was Heaven and Earth coming together
[1:22:06] in this realm you're in the condition
[1:22:08] that God could come down and give
[1:22:09] eternal life to me while I'm living here
[1:22:14] right but one of these days we going to
[1:22:16] get eternal life no no no no
[1:22:19] no that's right if you don't have
[1:22:23] eternal life you're lost exactly right
[1:22:26] amen and your theophany is going down
[1:22:29] whether you like it or not right your
[1:22:32] Celestial body is going downward right
[1:22:35] you may rejoice and Shout Glory
[1:22:37] Hallelujah and claim to believe
[1:22:39] everything right but it's still going
[1:22:42] down
[1:22:44] amen but if you get born
[1:22:48] again then the pool starts upward yeah
[1:22:55] and listen then if the pull starts
[1:23:02] upward the prophet said your soul is not
[1:23:07] complete he's talking about in the New
[1:23:10] Birth you know the new birth your Soul's
[1:23:13] not complete you know why right cuz you
[1:23:15] only have the earnest right
[1:23:19] y That's right look behind me on the
[1:23:21] Statue of a perfect man and you'll see
[1:23:23] down at the bottom of the pyramid is
[1:23:24] talking about faith that's your new
[1:23:26] birth but up at the top is
[1:23:31] love that when you're born again you
[1:23:34] have eternal life and that's your soul
[1:23:36] be in your theophany but the positive of
[1:23:38] your theophany is the finish of all
[1:23:41] things when we walk off of this earth
[1:23:42] and the change of the body amen because
[1:23:45] that's what's pulling us
[1:23:46] amen what's pulling you in the upward
[1:23:50] current it's easy to understand and the
[1:23:52] center his is going down and what's
[1:23:54] pulling him is what he is right right
[1:23:57] but in eternal life what's going upward
[1:23:59] is what's pulling
[1:24:00] us right think on these
[1:24:05] things think on it pray about it
[1:24:10] Lord do I have eternal
[1:24:17] life I believe the
[1:24:20] message I believe the Bible come
[1:24:24] on but do I have eternal life that's
[1:24:29] right and I've said it and I'll keep
[1:24:32] saying it till the day I die I'd rather
[1:24:34] be seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:36] right right and die and God tell me I
[1:24:39] had it all the time then for me to spend
[1:24:42] all of my life not seeking after God and
[1:24:46] find out at the end of it I didn't have
[1:24:47] him you said well can that happen
[1:24:49] brother random said the Sunday school
[1:24:51] teacher lady
[1:24:54] that's she thought she was right thought
[1:24:58] Sunday school he said but when she begin
[1:25:00] to die since she begin to scream and
[1:25:03] said you've lied to
[1:25:05] me did you told me I was saved and said
[1:25:08] now brother R said when all of the
[1:25:10] elements of the Human begin to break
[1:25:12] away since she saw her real self
[1:25:16] right y she said I'm lost of course you
[1:25:20] know what the preacher said give her
[1:25:22] another hpo to shut her
[1:25:26] up that's what the doctor's
[1:25:29] done instead of saying give her one to
[1:25:31] pull her out of that let her scream and
[1:25:32] holler let's pray for her soul give her
[1:25:34] another shot to put her out of it and
[1:25:38] sent that Soul off to a hell right
[1:25:41] because he wouldn't admit it
[1:25:45] wrong it's hard for a human being to say
[1:25:48] I'm wrong now words out of your mouth is
[1:25:54] cheap oh you say I'm
[1:25:56] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry that's easy to
[1:26:01] say Ain it but can you down in your
[1:26:03] heart say I'm
[1:26:08] sorry I say every day God I'm
[1:26:11] sorry I'm sorry I hav't studied I'm
[1:26:15] sorry I haven't been the person I need
[1:26:17] to be that's right I'm sorry Lord
[1:26:21] forgive me
[1:26:23] help
[1:26:24] me save
[1:26:29] me cuz if we don't have eternal life
[1:26:31] here there is no eternal life there is
[1:26:33] no Eternal
[1:26:35] theoy up in heaven right right you mean
[1:26:38] you you don't have it till you get there
[1:26:40] that's what you're saying see because
[1:26:42] the the scripture in 2 Corinthians 5:1
[1:26:45] said it's Eternal in the
[1:26:48] heavens so if you got one Eternal in the
[1:26:50] heavens but if you don't have it here is
[1:26:52] matching
[1:26:55] pieces how you expect to
[1:26:59] go we got to have eternal life
[1:27:03] here the soul of almighty
[1:27:07] God to come into our soul and make our
[1:27:10] soul
[1:27:11] Eternal now our soul is at theophany
[1:27:15] with an upward
[1:27:16] Cur to the positive of his
[1:27:21] mind
[1:27:23] somebody
[1:27:25] somewhere is going to match that
[1:27:28] amen amen and we'll walk off this
[1:27:32] Earth back on these things Heaven and
[1:27:35] Earth kissed each other when God and man
[1:27:39] become one so Heaven and Earth kissed
[1:27:41] each other the day you receive the
[1:27:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen yes sir
[1:27:47] the day you receive the soul of God in
[1:27:49] the form of the baptism of the Holy
[1:27:50] Ghost to give you eternal life that's
[1:27:53] Heaven and Earth
[1:27:54] kissed amen righteousness and
[1:27:57] peace come
[1:28:00] together what a joyful time to have to
[1:28:04] see what eternal life really
[1:28:09] is than on these things let's stand
[1:28:13] together we're going into the
[1:28:18] communion think on these
[1:28:21] things
[1:28:30] all right 1 Corinthians
[1:28:35] 11 verse 23 for I have received of the
[1:28:37] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:28:39] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:28:41] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:28:43] when he had given thanks he break in and
[1:28:45] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:28:47] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:28:49] me after the same manner also he took
[1:28:52] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:28:54] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:28:57] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:28:58] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:29:01] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:29:03] you the Lord's death till he come
[1:29:05] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:29:07] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:29:09] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:29:11] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:29:14] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:29:15] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:29:17] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:29:19] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:29:22] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:29:24] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:29:26] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:29:28] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:29:31] when we are judged we are chasen of the
[1:29:33] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:29:35] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:29:37] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:29:40] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:29:42] eat at home that you come not together
[1:29:44] under condemnation the rest will I set

[1:36:22] services and doctor told me to go home
[1:36:25] the back was messed up he said you go
[1:36:26] home and you go to bed I'll let you go I
[1:36:28] said I'll go home and I ain't telling
[1:36:31] you about going to
[1:36:33] bed I came home and I come right
[1:36:35] straight up here and I sit in this
[1:36:37] church with a heating pad on my back for
[1:36:40] three
[1:36:43] services dying with
[1:36:46] pain but you know what God touched me
[1:36:50] now what what if I stayed at home laid
[1:36:53] up in the
[1:36:56] bed this just what I say don't never
[1:36:59] stay out of church because there's
[1:37:00] something
[1:37:01] wrong what was it the sister told her
[1:37:04] husband that you know said you're a
[1:37:06] young convert and and you uh you uh you
[1:37:10] were used to doing things and said you
[1:37:12] may go back and fall and do it again but
[1:37:14] said don't stay away said come home I'll
[1:37:18] help you pray

[1:37:28] through that's why we're here for to
[1:37:30] help each other pray
[1:37:33] through
[1:37:36] that's nobody don't look down on nobody
[1:37:38] else because of what to do because we
[1:37:40] all do our things anyway we all have a
[1:37:42] problem
[1:37:44] am let's just be right
[1:37:48] okay let's do it that way father
[1:37:52] the Bible said took bread and blessed it
[1:37:54] father we thank you for this bread it's
[1:37:56] been made for this purpose today and we
[1:37:58] ask you to is sanctify it and sanctify
[1:38:01] the partakers we know that this is only
[1:38:03] in representation of your
[1:38:05] body and we believe you father but we
[1:38:09] ask you to just sanctify each one here
[1:38:11] that we may all be together as one in
[1:38:13] you bless each one in Jesus name
[1:38:20] amen
[1:38:27] these symbols mean a whole lot more than
[1:38:29] what we think it does anyway but
[1:38:32] yet we don't put our emphasis on symbols
[1:38:35] we put our emphasis on the
[1:38:37] word but still this is supposed to
[1:38:39] represent the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:38:42] Christ and that's supposed to be
[1:38:44] representing the
[1:38:45] word and we're supposed to eat this and
[1:38:48] they were so back there commanded of
[1:38:50] certain way to eat until if they didn't
[1:38:53] follow it that way you know it could be
[1:38:55] death that's right but they followed
[1:38:57] What the Lord told them and it was life
[1:39:00] so let's do what God says and just
[1:39:02] believe it and accept it seen people
[1:39:05] healed taking communion amen that's
[1:39:09] right why because it was what their
[1:39:12] minds or thoughts were
[1:39:16] on so just remember this it may be a
[1:39:20] symbol
[1:39:21] but what I love about it is is the the
[1:39:24] wedding supper is going to
[1:39:26] be taking to
[1:39:29] communion father we thank you for this
[1:39:31] wine that's gone through the process now
[1:39:33] changing to where it is it gets better
[1:39:35] every day and we know that this the Tope
[1:39:38] of thy Holy Spirit Lord the life that
[1:39:41] you gave for each one of us we ask you
[1:39:44] to sanctify the wine and partakers and
[1:39:46] as we eat the little piece of bread we
[1:39:48] drink this little small amount of wine
[1:39:51] that even tomorrow that will be blood
[1:39:53] cells in our body that will literally be
[1:39:57] creating life within each one of us we
[1:40:00] ask you to just bless and guide each one
[1:40:02] as we partake of this in Jesus name
[1:40:09] amen come
[1:40:12] morning I
[1:40:14] walk by the
[1:40:17] river I'll rest me
[1:40:21] the
[1:40:23] ever
[1:40:25] tree I'll
[1:40:28] carry my cross through the
[1:40:34] midnight come
[1:40:36] morning there
[1:40:39] story for
[1:40:42] me sometimes I'm
[1:40:46] despised and
[1:40:49] rejected and I
[1:40:52] question oh
[1:40:54] Father
[1:40:57] how then I take one more
[1:41:02] look at Mount
[1:41:05] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:41:11] go
[1:41:13] home come
[1:41:15] morning I
[1:41:18] walk by the river
[1:41:22] I'll
[1:41:24] rest the ever green
[1:41:29] dree I'll
[1:41:32] carry my
[1:41:34] cross through the
[1:41:37] midnight come
[1:41:40] morning there's
[1:41:43] glory for
[1:41:45] me what about a a people that knows the
[1:41:49] truth of God's word
[1:41:53] we're not in the days when we wondered
[1:41:55] if this was this or that was that or
[1:41:57] whatever in the days when we can
[1:42:01] understand the truth you shall know the
[1:42:03] truth and the truth will set you
[1:42:05] free see doctrines and ideas
[1:42:08] bind Creeds bind they don't set you free
[1:42:13] that's why brother R said the true
[1:42:15] Prophet would only try to bind you to
[1:42:17] the word right but around never tried to
[1:42:20] binds you to himself he tried to bind us
[1:42:23] to the
[1:42:24] word of almighty god well then that's
[1:42:28] what any true Minister ought to be you
[1:42:31] ought to be concerned with one
[1:42:33] thing trying to get the people bound to
[1:42:36] the word that's right get it to where
[1:42:38] that word has got the preeminence in
[1:42:40] each one of our hearts and lives that's
[1:42:42] right that we can see God made manifest
[1:42:45] among
[1:42:47] us we think on these
