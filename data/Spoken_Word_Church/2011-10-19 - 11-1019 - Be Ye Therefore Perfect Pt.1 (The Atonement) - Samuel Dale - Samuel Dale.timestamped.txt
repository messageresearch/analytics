[9:13] 5 we're just going to read one verse and
[9:16] then we'll get back to our scripture in
[9:17] a moment but remember now the Lord
[9:19] willing this coming weekend brother
[9:21] forny will be with us to minister unto
[9:24] us for the weekend he's coming down for

[9:47] Sunday but we'll be having the uh having
[9:50] dinner together and fellowshipping
[9:52] together so just remember these
[9:54] announcements I know you you put them
[9:57] all down and keep up with them so just
[10:01] uh come and have a good time I think
[10:03] we'll have a good time for these
[10:04] brothers coming in and and speaking for
[10:06] usen but as like I said I want to just
[10:08] read one scripture we'll be seated then
[10:10] we'll pick up the rest of it all right
[10:12] so this is the thought that we'll be
[10:14] bringing for I don't know how many
[10:16] services maybe a couple of services
[10:19] anyway but uh let's go to Matthew 5 and
[10:23] then we'll just read to 1 verse
[10:26] 48 you Heavenly Father we thank you for
[10:28] your love and your grace unto us thank
[10:31] you for all things we pray that you
[10:33] would just bless us now with your
[10:35] presence because we worshiped we' sung
[10:37] about you we prayed to you we we poured
[10:40] out our heart unto you now and we've
[10:42] gathered here for one purpose and that's
[10:44] to serve you now we pray that you would
[10:48] just come on the scene now to manifest
[10:50] yourself Among Us and let your love be
[10:53] with each and every one of us just touch
[10:54] each one Lord take away that problem
[10:57] brother Danny there's having with his
[10:58] leg Lord and just let him be delivered
[11:01] let everything be all right we love you
[11:03] and we thank you we ask you to just
[11:05] guide us now forgive our sins because
[11:08] that's what we want to do is stand
[11:10] complete in you we love you and we thank
[11:13] you in Jesus is your
[11:15] name just going to read one scripture
[11:17] very familiar with everybody everybody
[11:19] can quote it by heart Matthew 5:48 says
[11:23] be ye therefore
[11:24] perfect even as your father which is in
[11:28] heaven
[11:29] is perfect you may be seated the Lord
[11:32] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[11:36] word
[11:39] now I'll be using this for a couple of
[11:41] services I'm
[11:43] sure and trying to bring a thought so uh
[11:47] we will just go with it as far as what
[11:49] the Lord leads
[11:51] but everybody you know wants to go
[11:54] through this scripture and they try to
[11:55] figure it out that it means this and it
[11:57] means that and that's fine um you know
[12:00] it means a full age it means you know uh
[12:03] different things and all and we will get
[12:06] back to those things as we go along but
[12:10] what I want you to think
[12:12] about is what is the
[12:17] background are the reason this statement
[12:22] is
[12:23] made all right so we remember how that
[12:26] we've talked about the before and the
[12:28] after is the answer to to all things and
[12:31] so what we want to do is just back up a
[12:34] little bit and uh brother Joe will be
[12:37] putting it up there from verse 37 if you
[12:39] want to follow that and and you know
[12:42] read with us but this is Matthew
[12:47] 5 which it starts off and it's called
[12:49] the
[12:51] Beatitudes all right so you go about
[12:53] somewhere around 10 verses or something
[12:55] like that and you're covering the
[12:58] beatitude
[12:59] you know blessed is he that this blessed
[13:01] is the pure in heart blessed is all of
[13:03] the things and then it changes to uh
[13:07] what if you'll notice especially scofi
[13:09] uses the word there and it changes from
[13:12] the Beatitudes to the
[13:15] similitudes which similitudes means like
[13:18] your your likeness or or something you
[13:22] know taking place all right so you know
[13:25] I want you to think with it cuz we're
[13:27] going to go with this and just get a
[13:29] point out of the way then we're going to
[13:30] drop way back in the Old Testament and
[13:32] come up to talk about our thought for
[13:35] tonight all right but as I said now the
[13:39] the
[13:40] Beatitudes that's be your attitude words
[13:43] blessed is he and that was he was
[13:45] telling us you know how that how blessed
[13:48] we was and are and then the similitudes
[13:52] brings in to our lives the things that
[13:56] you know we're we're talking about in
[13:59] the bless so we're not going to read the
[14:00] whole thing but we'll just stop up and
[14:02] start on verse 37 of uh this Matthew 5
[14:07] and I'm I'm just telling you just think
[14:09] about why did he say the seemingly going
[14:13] along and covering this and covering
[14:15] that and going this away and going that
[14:17] away and and talking about life and what
[14:20] we should be and what we need to be and
[14:23] and all in and and the the the things
[14:26] that our lives should be manifesting and
[14:29] then all at once he just says be
[14:31] therefore
[14:32] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[14:35] perfect well now what's the background
[14:38] for that so let's drop up there and Jo
[14:41] got it up verse 37 so you just follow
[14:43] with us
[14:45] now but let your Communications be yay
[14:48] yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than
[14:53] these cometh of
[14:56] evil you have heard that it hath been
[14:58] said
[14:59] an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[15:01] tooth but I say unto you that you resist
[15:05] not
[15:06] evil but whosoever shall smite thee on
[15:09] thy right cheek turn to him the other
[15:13] also and if any man will sue thee at the
[15:15] law and take away thy coat let him have
[15:19] thy cloak also and what and who soever
[15:23] shall compel thee to go a mile go with
[15:26] him twine wow give to him that asketh
[15:29] thee and from him that would borrow of
[15:31] thee turn not thou
[15:35] away you have heard that it hath been
[15:38] said Thou shalt love thy
[15:40] neighbor and hate thine
[15:43] enemy but I say unto you love your
[15:46] enemies amen bless them that curse you
[15:50] do good to them that hate you and pray
[15:52] for them which despitefully use you and
[15:55] persecute not that you may be the
[15:59] children of your father and watch that
[16:02] you may be the children of your father
[16:05] which is in heaven for he maketh his son
[16:08] to rise on the evil and on the good and
[16:11] sendeth rain on the just and the unjust
[16:16] for if you love them which love you what
[16:18] reward have you do not even the
[16:20] publicans the same right and if you
[16:23] salute your brethren only what do ye
[16:25] more than others do not even the
[16:28] publicans do not even the publicans so
[16:32] be therefore perfect even as your father
[16:34] which is in heaven is perfect
[16:37] now like I said did he just coming along
[16:41] and talking about her attitudes and her
[16:44] similitudes and the way and all like
[16:47] that and then all at once he just says
[16:49] be therefore
[16:51] perfect it seemed like that it is a uh
[16:55] and forgive me because I don't know no
[16:57] other way of saying it but it seems like
[16:59] it's an out of text right
[17:03] thought I said seem like you know it
[17:07] seemed like he's just coming along and
[17:08] going through these things and he just
[17:10] says go right straight on with it but uh
[17:14] I don't think so so that's this is going
[17:16] to be now the background of of what
[17:19] we're going to try to bring out
[17:23] because notice especially now you don't
[17:26] have to pull it back up
[17:30] but look what it says in verse
[17:33] 43 you have heard that it ha been said
[17:35] Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[17:38] thine
[17:39] enemy
[17:42] okay but I say unto
[17:45] you love your
[17:50] enemies
[17:51] now the point I want you to see is to me
[17:55] there is a dividing
[17:57] between
[18:00] the fact of what he's telling
[18:04] us and the fact of what is being really
[18:09] said in the
[18:14] word and what I mean by dividing
[18:18] it one of them is saying like we've read
[18:23] there somebody do good to you it's easy
[18:26] to do good right
[18:29] you know right it's easy to pray for
[18:31] somebody that's praying for
[18:32] you it's easy to be good to people that
[18:35] are good to
[18:38] you but where is the Perfection
[18:44] there the Perfection is not in being
[18:47] good to those that are good to you right
[18:51] right that has nothing to do with it see
[18:55] I wrote my Bible this
[18:57] way
[19:00] but I say unto you verse 44 love your
[19:06] enemies see God does it this
[19:11] way God does it this way that's what I
[19:14] wrote in my
[19:15] Bible God does it this way he he loves
[19:18] his enemies
[19:20] right he loves them that persecuted
[19:24] him he loves all mankind righten he
[19:27] loves
[19:30] nobody and that's what makes him
[19:35] perfect now come on when you drop down
[19:37] here see then it's coming into view that
[19:40] you're talking about a
[19:42] Perfection or being perfect as your
[19:47] father so that's what he's saying if we
[19:50] can't do these out of
[19:54] love then what good is it right amen
[20:00] if we can't love those who hate us yeah
[20:03] where's there any perfection in it
[20:05] where's there any of the life of God now
[20:09] we surely we know for certain that God
[20:10] is perfect right there shouldn't be any
[20:13] question with anybody's mind know that
[20:15] that God is
[20:17] perfect well if we don't display the
[20:21] things that he
[20:25] displayed in forgiving and doing and all
[20:29] how can we even talk about
[20:37] perfection if we don't do like he done
[20:41] why even talk about what the whether
[20:43] this word perfect here means partially
[20:46] forgiven or all the way forgiven or
[20:48] growth development or or some kind of a
[20:55] thing see the background shows you
[21:00] the
[21:03] Perfection come
[21:06] on Amen you have heard that it hath been
[21:09] said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[21:11] hate thine
[21:13] enemy but I say unto you here's my
[21:16] nature here's my way here is my
[21:18] perfection love your
[21:20] enemies bless them that curse
[21:23] you and do good to them that hate you
[21:26] and pray for them which def
[21:28] spitefully use you and persecute
[21:32] you can you do that well I talk about
[21:36] being perfect right all you got is
[21:40] definitions of words right oh perfect
[21:43] that means complete hey yeah I know that
[21:45] I preached it myself I believe that
[21:47] we'll get back to that that's
[21:53] right the follow own
[21:56] man why do you want to do these things
[21:58] why do you want to beat the word that
[22:00] you can bless them that curse you and do
[22:02] good to them that hate you and pray for
[22:06] them that despitefully use you and pray
[22:09] for them that even persecute
[22:11] you you know that it was who was it
[22:15] polyart requested permission when they
[22:18] came to capture him to take him in and
[22:20] finally killed
[22:21] him he requested permission and was
[22:25] granted to pray for the sin of the
[22:28] people and pray for those people that
[22:32] come to capture him and gave him 2 hours
[22:34] and he prayed for
[22:36] him now that's
[22:41] Perfection you understand what I'm
[22:42] getting at do we can talk about
[22:45] perfection is being a sinless
[22:50] position is that what it
[22:52] is is perfection a
[22:55] sinless position when the uh the
[23:00] Pharisees the high
[23:02] priest especially we would just use
[23:05] him if one Mark was found against
[23:09] him they would take him out and kill
[23:14] him Paul said concerning the
[23:18] law you know that he was
[23:23] blameless he's
[23:26] perfect cuz the word blindness would be
[23:29] Perfection right perfect same
[23:33] word so what is
[23:36] perfection and what's it based
[23:41] on now wonder that brother around and
[23:43] said that you
[23:47] know no matter how high you
[23:51] jump said make sure you can walk
[23:53] straight and you come down right why
[23:56] because that's a display of of your life
[23:59] now did Jesus do these
[24:01] things did he pray for his
[24:04] enemies did he pray for them that
[24:06] persecuted him did he you know desp did
[24:09] he what what are we supposed to do
[24:15] same why verse 45 that ye may be the
[24:18] children of your father which is in
[24:22] heaven
[24:25] right if our lives don't display that
[24:27] we're the children of God then who whose
[24:29] children are we
[24:31] right right come on you can holler Faith
[24:34] all you want to you can holler
[24:35] Revelation you can holler I believe the
[24:37] message you know you can holler all you
[24:39] want
[24:43] to but remember the
[24:46] statement what is
[24:48] it I can't because of your life I can't
[24:52] see word you saying right the word
[24:55] you're talking about right they that you
[24:57] may be the children of your father in
[25:00] other words have the very nature the
[25:02] Perfection of the father for he maketh
[25:05] his son watch
[25:07] now for me he maketh his son to rise on
[25:10] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[25:12] rain on the just and on the
[25:15] unjust now because of brother Ram using
[25:18] that in the vision that he saw of the
[25:21] the Earth you know the the the trees and
[25:23] how the rain fell on everything see we
[25:25] just take it to be like that
[25:28] well that just simply means that it'll
[25:30] rain out here on a tree it rain out here
[25:31] on the grass it rain out here on this
[25:33] it'll rain on the good it rain on the
[25:35] bad it rains on the the weeds as well as
[25:37] it does on the others and we just well
[25:39] we got it all figured out have we right
[25:44] that ye may be the children of your
[25:46] father which is in
[25:47] heaven because of his
[25:50] nature and his
[25:53] Perfection that he wants to display
[25:56] right he maketh his son under
[26:00] rise on the
[26:04] evil and on the
[26:06] good sers Reign on the just and the
[26:09] unjust for if you love them which love
[26:11] you what reward have
[26:13] you do not this even the publicans the
[26:18] same and if you salute your brethren
[26:20] only what do you more than others do not
[26:23] even the public cons Soul that's right
[26:28] be therefore
[26:30] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[26:35] perfect now we can get definitions like
[26:39] I said we can go through the Greeks we
[26:41] can go through and we'll cover these
[26:42] things as we go along cuz I'm sure this
[26:44] is going to run into few Services
[26:49] anyway
[26:54] but let's drop
[26:56] back
[26:59] let's start with man in his sinful
[27:03] condition and that God made a
[27:07] way for that
[27:10] man to be perfect right
[27:13] right now here's where we go nobody can
[27:17] be
[27:20] perfect if God says you are you
[27:24] are right let no man argue about what
[27:28] God says
[27:30] right when God says you're perfect
[27:33] that's it amen who can argue with him
[27:35] about
[27:38] it well you know we all do wrong who
[27:41] worried about that we all know that
[27:45] right to it evidently ain't based upon a
[27:48] lot of that
[27:51] stuff what is it based on what is
[27:53] perfection based
[27:56] on
[27:59] simple question simple thought cuz this
[28:02] is what simple I am huh coming down to
[28:04] the end of the series and this is not
[28:06] the end I just keep going on a little
[28:07] higher but you know we kind of get away
[28:09] from a thought we were bringing and get
[28:11] to another one I thought Lord where in
[28:12] the world am I going
[28:14] now and I heard brother around say
[28:17] something and I said
[28:19] okay we'll go
[28:22] there and then it began to
[28:24] develop all
[28:26] right
[28:28] but
[28:29] now if you can't
[28:35] understand something the best thing to
[28:37] do is to go back and pick up a type or a
[28:40] background or a talk right so let's drw
[28:43] back in the Old
[28:45] Testament and pick up a
[28:47] top and let's
[28:49] follow that down through and tonight
[28:51] specifically now so even if I read
[28:53] something in a minute I'm dealing only
[28:57] with
[28:58] the Old Testament Saints and the
[29:01] conditions that
[29:07] existed you say well brother Dale were
[29:10] they
[29:12] perfect little
[29:14] Pharisees you couldn't name one thing
[29:17] that
[29:19] done come on
[29:25] right is that right come on I mean am I
[29:29] right they could you couldn't find
[29:31] anything they done wrong
[29:33] right well if they had done anything
[29:36] wrong right how close were they to being
[29:39] perfect right
[29:44] right because you got to remember that
[29:46] perfect would will symbolize and when we
[29:49] finally get to it it will come out to
[29:51] be you're not
[29:55] guilty because you can't be perfect if
[29:58] you're guilty
[30:02] right come on right you
[30:06] agree you're guilty of anything can't be
[30:10] perfect the Bible said though if you're
[30:12] righteousness doesn't exceed the
[30:14] righteousness of the scribes and
[30:16] Pharisees you'll no way in okay but see
[30:20] that's way on down the
[30:22] road let's just go back let's drop back
[30:25] and I didn't give these to Joe so we Len
[30:27] use
[30:28] it but let's go to a little scripture
[30:31] and let's start a
[30:32] thought a thought of somebody being
[30:37] perfect as I said then you go ahead and
[30:40] toot toot your horn do all nobody's
[30:45] perfect well if God says I am talk to
[30:49] him about it amen that's right a no
[30:54] arguments he'll tell you whether I am or
[30:57] not
[30:59] amen I thought there was a man there one
[31:02] time
[31:05] that that God was so proud of him until
[31:08] he
[31:10] said have you considered my servant
[31:18] job you know it may not be the wording
[31:20] there because I didn't think of that
[31:22] scripture but you know God was saying
[31:24] job is perfect right y
[31:32] right you know what happened cuz he'd
[31:34] offered the sacrifice right he done what
[31:38] God said he was not guilty his buddies
[31:42] tried to cond him sin he said I'm not
[31:47] s he said I've made the atonement that
[31:49] God said cuz that's what we're going to
[31:51] be talking about tonight the title of be
[31:54] the be therefore perfect and we'll just
[31:55] start part one but the tit subtitle will
[31:58] be the
[32:01] atonement so let's go back to
[32:05] Exodus and just watch
[32:08] this as we come
[32:11] down go to Exodus
[32:15] 30 now what we're doing tonight is like
[32:17] I said I'm going to be laying down all
[32:19] we through the service tonight the the
[32:22] the the Commandments of God the the what
[32:24] to do and and the things like that and
[32:27] and and God looking down at those people
[32:30] and he saw them perfect
[32:35] right as long as they done what he
[32:39] said he saw them
[32:42] perfect no no no that couldn't be
[32:45] perfect brother we know we'll get to
[32:47] that okay come
[32:50] on but as far as God was concerned
[32:53] that's perfect now you talk to him about
[32:56] it
[32:57] right I don't care what your thoughts or
[32:59] ideas are mine are yours either one if
[33:02] we can show it in the word s in the word
[33:04] that's
[33:06] it come
[33:08] on look at
[33:10] Exodus chapter
[33:14] 30 we just start off about the atonement
[33:17] verse
[33:19] 9 you shall offer no strange incense
[33:22] their own he's talking about building
[33:23] the Altar and getting everything ready
[33:25] the Ark of the Covenant The Mercy Seat
[33:27] all of the things the
[33:29] Commandments you shall offer no strange
[33:32] incense there own nor bur sacrifice nor
[33:36] meat offerings neither shall ye poor
[33:39] drink offering their own and Aaron shall
[33:41] make an atonement upon the horns of it
[33:46] once in a year with the blood of the sin
[33:48] offerings and for atonements once in the
[33:51] year shall he make atonement upon it
[33:53] throughout your generation it is most
[33:56] holy un to the
[33:58] Lord
[34:00] now we know that what God commanded he
[34:05] gave it to Moses right
[34:08] right God gave Moses the Commandments of
[34:11] what to do right so now get that in your
[34:14] mind of what my point he gave to Moses
[34:18] Moses tells the people they write it
[34:21] down they keep a record everything
[34:23] said you know and God tells them to do
[34:26] this and don't do this and don't do this
[34:28] do this don't do that and and one time
[34:31] in there I I don't I try to remember get
[34:35] to it in a minute in the scripture but
[34:37] one time in there they had a little
[34:38] situation came up that they they went
[34:42] back to what Moses had said and they
[34:43] found out somebody had done
[34:45] something said what we going to do cuz
[34:47] we don't have no record of what to
[34:50] do and Moses didn't even have a record
[34:52] of what to do for that
[34:55] situation so he goes before the Lord and
[34:58] he comes back and he says we take the
[35:00] guy and kill
[35:03] him that's what he says do
[35:05] it you know what they done they took him
[35:07] out and killed
[35:10] him because God's word was passed down
[35:14] through into Moses right so in the
[35:17] writing of Genesis actually Leviticus
[35:19] Numbers Deuteronomy is the writings of
[35:21] Moses that God gave unto Moses his word
[35:27] right amen right all
[35:32] right
[35:34] now he said do this every
[35:37] year so every year Aaron now they had
[35:40] many atonements right I I looked in this
[35:43] I thought oh Lord that's 60 or 70 times
[35:45] the word atonement in the old test might
[35:47] even be more than that I thought I sure
[35:49] I can't cover all this so I just use
[35:50] this
[35:53] one but he was told to make an atonement
[35:55] now there was atonement for all kind of
[35:57] things there was atonements because you
[36:00] you you you got
[36:02] jealous there was offerings that you had
[36:04] to make right there was offerings you
[36:07] had to make because of a a male child
[36:09] being born there was offerings you had
[36:11] to make for this all of that was
[36:15] atonements all right now the word
[36:17] atonement means to
[36:21] cover it means to
[36:24] purge make an atonement
[36:27] make
[36:29] reconciliation cover over with pitch you
[36:32] know like tar put on cover
[36:34] over it means to be covered now that's
[36:37] what atonement means okay now you got
[36:40] other definitions as you go along with
[36:42] other ones because it'll have a little
[36:44] varying and that's 37 uh 20 strong you
[36:47] got a little variation in the word
[36:50] atonement but just remember it's
[36:52] basically talking about a covering all
[36:55] right so once a year Aaron had to go
[36:58] because Moses told the people what God
[37:04] Said
[37:06] right now want that in your
[37:08] mind Moses told the people what to
[37:12] do God told
[37:15] Moses what to do right now I've always
[37:19] said it this way what if Moses would
[37:21] have walked out and said now Aaron what
[37:23] you do is you get all your clothes on
[37:25] and you go stand on your
[37:28] head well if that have been what God
[37:30] said you know what Aon had to
[37:35] done come on he went stood on his head
[37:37] and he got all his clothes on right cuz
[37:40] that been what God
[37:41] Said So Moses didn't shortcut it nowhere
[37:45] he brought exactly what God Said to do
[37:48] like I said even in that one case where
[37:50] he didn't even know what to do he said
[37:52] God what I do he said take him and kill
[37:55] him all
[37:57] right now so once a year they had to
[38:01] make an offering an
[38:04] atonement for the sins of the
[38:06] people you know what that
[38:09] done we'll get down to it in a minute
[38:11] when we get to our thought that covered
[38:13] the people right
[38:15] right atonement
[38:18] covered now it couldn't do away with
[38:23] it but it could cover it right
[38:29] it can make the people stand before
[38:34] God
[38:35] perfect that's right right yes sir you
[38:40] said no not well you tell me what it
[38:43] was they were covered
[38:48] amen how was it that Adam and Eve could
[38:51] walk out of the
[38:54] garden in the sinful condition they
[38:56] existed
[38:58] in because God made the
[39:04] atonement and they were
[39:07] covered so when I get the word
[39:10] covered and you'll see what I'm talking
[39:12] about how it made them
[39:18] perfect so you can go down the street
[39:20] out here and run if there is no law you
[39:22] can run 90 mph right or what is that
[39:24] Autobon thing overseas over there no Li
[39:26] speed limit to it you just run anything
[39:28] you want
[39:29] to cuz the law doesn't say
[39:32] anything but when the law says 30 we run
[39:35] 30
[39:37] right well because you break it if
[39:40] you're running
[39:44] 29 you can't be fine now we we're in the
[39:47] day when the garbage Canin police
[39:48] officers will do anything in the world
[39:49] we get that out of your mind get what
[39:51] I'm talking about you running
[39:54] 29 you can't break the law
[39:57] right so we
[40:01] justify
[40:03] right and we're going to find out what
[40:05] justifi really means one of these days
[40:07] when we get back to it cuz it'll all tie
[40:09] into
[40:14] this so you see it once a year he go in
[40:16] and make a
[40:19] sacrifice and you know what that done
[40:21] that covered
[40:24] that and you know that God could
[40:26] fellowship with the people for one more
[40:28] year that's right and they wasn't
[40:33] killed cuz they were
[40:35] covered he made an
[40:41] atonement drop over to Leviticus let's
[40:43] get another one while we're here and
[40:45] then we'll get our talk
[40:47] going look at
[40:50] Leviticus
[40:55] n
[41:01] we read about seven verses and he came
[41:03] to pass on the eighth day that Moses
[41:06] called Aaron and his sons and the Elders
[41:09] of Israel and he said unto them said
[41:12] unto Aaron excuse me take the a young
[41:15] calf for a sin offering and a round for
[41:17] a burnt offering without blemish and
[41:20] offer them before the
[41:24] Lord and unto the children of of Israel
[41:26] Thou shalt speak saying take ye a kid of
[41:29] the goats for a sin offering and a calf
[41:31] and a lamb both of the first year
[41:34] without blemish for a burnt offering
[41:36] also a bulock and a RAM for a peace
[41:39] offering to sacrifice before the Lord
[41:41] and a meat offering mingled with oil
[41:43] giving you this to show you many
[41:45] atonements for to the to the day the
[41:48] Lord will for today the Lord will appear
[41:50] unto
[41:52] you and they brought out that which
[41:55] Moses command commanded before the
[41:57] Tabernacle of congregation and all the
[42:00] congregation of congregation Drew near
[42:02] and stood before the Lord now who is
[42:05] they really standing
[42:08] before
[42:10] okay now Moses was doing all this who
[42:13] was there really standing before right
[42:15] why did they get in trouble back there
[42:16] for what they' done with Moses come on
[42:19] and Moses said this is the thing which
[42:22] the Lord commanded that you should do
[42:25] and the glory of of the Lord shall
[42:27] appear unto you and Moses said unto
[42:30] Aaron go unto the Altar and offer thy
[42:33] sin offering and thy burnt
[42:36] offering and make an atonement for
[42:39] thyself and for the people and offer the
[42:43] offering of the
[42:47] people and
[42:49] watch and make an atonement for them as
[42:53] the Lord
[42:54] commanded all right
[42:57] make an
[43:00] atonement so an atonement means a
[43:05] covering it was done once a
[43:08] year many atonements I read this to get
[43:11] in the words atonement but get into
[43:13] where that you had it for the meat
[43:14] offering you had this right you had that
[43:15] one you had all kind but the Commandment
[43:18] was from the
[43:20] Lord but if you'll notice Moses was
[43:23] always telling them what to do right
[43:28] okay now follow that in a minute till we
[43:31] get down to
[43:34] something we know that every sacrifice
[43:37] that was
[43:38] made would be speaking of Jesus Christ
[43:41] that's right that's a later sermon
[43:44] okay it could only cover
[43:48] sin the sacrifice back there could only
[43:51] cover sin he could not do away with it
[43:55] because there was no soul in the life of
[43:57] the
[43:57] animal to be able to come back upon the
[44:00] believer so every time he offered the
[44:03] animal see it only covered brother
[44:05] Harris used to bring it out was called
[44:07] the word
[44:08] Capo all
[44:11] right everything was as we call it
[44:14] pushed forward because
[44:18] that animal
[44:20] life even though it was taken in the
[44:23] place of man and and what it would do
[44:25] then the blood would be placed there and
[44:28] as it was then God would looking at the
[44:30] blood of the
[44:32] animal and not looking at you and
[44:34] brother R said you had to take your hand
[44:36] lay it on your sacrifice right and said
[44:39] the blood would be in the animal kicking
[44:41] and that and said what you would do said
[44:43] you would lay your hand he said you
[44:45] believe then that that animal was taking
[44:47] your
[44:48] place so it made a covering
[44:52] amen all right he could not do away was
[44:57] sin it pushed everything to Calvary
[45:00] where that Romans 6 and: 10 said that he
[45:04] died under sin once
[45:08] right see Jesus Christ died to pay for
[45:11] all
[45:13] sin right
[45:16] amen now as we were bringing out in the
[45:18] last message that how that those Old
[45:21] Testament
[45:23] Saints could come up
[45:27] and that would show that we would not
[45:29] have to go through the tribulation
[45:32] right I hope you followed that
[45:34] message cuz those Old Testament Saints
[45:37] came up what those that were under the
[45:42] atonement not
[45:44] everybody those that were under the
[45:47] atonement would be able to come
[45:50] up why because we don't have to go
[45:53] through the tribulation for perfection
[45:56] right they were
[46:00] perfect now I know this ain't going to
[46:02] go over too good with some of you
[46:04] probably it's all right just go ahead
[46:05] you keep your computers running but
[46:07] after a while you might find out that we
[46:09] do know a little bit about what we're
[46:10] talking about cuz I got a couple of
[46:13] questions don't ask
[46:21] you see it was all pushed forward to
[46:24] Calvary right that's
[46:26] right it could only be
[46:30] covered it could not be eradicated or
[46:33] his brother around would use
[46:35] divorced amen so it can only be pushed
[46:41] forward and Jesus Christ then died for
[46:48] everybody but get the point now as long
[46:52] as it's
[46:54] said
[46:56] offer that
[46:59] lamb for one year God couldn't destroy
[47:03] those people right
[47:05] right cuz they were under the
[47:09] atonement that's what your atonement was
[47:11] for see so every time you'd come up
[47:14] you'd have something take place you'd
[47:16] have to make an offering you'd have to
[47:18] make an
[47:19] atonement cuz that was your natural
[47:21] life this was the big situation that
[47:25] covered whole Camp as far as uh not
[47:28] being
[47:30] eradicated you know the lamb once a year
[47:34] but then we had each one like the said
[47:37] as we come down then be our
[47:41] attitudes and if we don't follow the
[47:43] similitude doesn't match up with the
[47:48] beatitude say hey what do I got to offer
[47:51] a sacrifice Aaron made
[47:53] it that was for the C cing for
[47:56] everything but each one individually had
[47:59] to be made
[48:02] right if you didn't you were
[48:05] destroyed if you didn't go down and make
[48:08] an atonement for a baby the baby could
[48:11] die
[48:13] right you
[48:16] understand see all of the things has got
[48:18] to match together but when God looked
[48:21] down at Israel he saw on the apple of
[48:24] his eye right he could come down and
[48:27] fellowship with
[48:28] them
[48:30] right the dirtiest thing could be done
[48:33] that even who was it B would would go
[48:36] before the Lord you know or Baum there
[48:39] so look at the hinder Parts he don't see
[48:43] nothing
[48:45] right he said they're under the
[48:47] sacrificial
[48:49] lamb they're
[48:53] perfect right
[48:56] so we might find out Perfection is a
[48:58] little bit different than what we think
[48:59] when we get time all
[49:02] right so then what are we
[49:05] doing let's just make sure that brother
[49:07] randoms covers these things so go ahead
[49:09] and pull up the the number one quote
[49:11] brother
[49:13] Joe see some people would argue with you
[49:15] about the the thing so we we got a
[49:18] prophet so we just put up what he says
[49:19] and then forget
[49:21] it so on questions and answers part two
[49:24] are number two
[49:26] paragraph 35
[49:27] 1954 103 the evening
[49:30] service now there was a time that the
[49:33] people didn't go into the presence of
[49:35] God when they died the justified in
[49:37] other words the good
[49:39] people that was in the Old Testament
[49:41] they went into a place called
[49:43] paradise and there are The Souls of the
[49:45] just waited in Paradise but Paradise was
[49:49] a place where God kept the souls in like
[49:52] a dream land until the blood of Jesus
[49:55] Christ was shed for the blood of bulls
[49:58] and goats could not take away sin it
[50:01] only covered up sin but Jesus's blood
[50:05] takes away sin so we want to get that
[50:07] last part but I just want him to get
[50:09] these points and you seeing what he say
[50:11] that that blood of the bulls and goats
[50:13] couldn't do away with it it couldn't
[50:15] eradicate It could only
[50:17] cover all right go to the next one
[50:20] paragraph or e75 the Queen of Sheba
[50:24] 6110
[50:26] and then God was with us God above us
[50:28] and God With Us in Christ Emmanuel God
[50:31] With Us and then when that blood cell
[50:33] was broke at Calvary and the blood was
[50:35] shed the spirit under the old
[50:38] dispensation sin was just covered not
[50:42] forgiven covered because the blood of
[50:45] goats and Bulls could not take away sin
[50:49] it only covered it then he goes into the
[50:51] life how it gave it life and the things
[50:53] would happen but there was no way for to
[50:55] be done right going down to the next one
[50:58] God hidden hiding himself in Simplicity
[51:01] and revealing himself the
[51:04] same paragraph
[51:06] 407 but when he crossed he separated his
[51:09] son ship he's a center by Nature he's
[51:12] under the hands and Dominion of Satan
[51:15] and God took a sacrifice a chemical of
[51:17] the
[51:18] blood but the blood of bulls and ghost
[51:20] did not divorce sin it only covered it
[51:24] that explains a cover
[51:26] if I got a red spot on my hand and
[51:28] covered it with white the red spot still
[51:30] there see it's still there but God s
[51:33] down from heaven obl for sin but it was
[51:35] the blood of his own son see so that
[51:39] would go on further all right that's
[51:40] what I'm trying to just hold it to the
[51:43] point next one message called look
[51:47] paragraph 6963
[51:49] 428 God being full of grace and mercy
[51:52] took a substitute and it was a lamb or
[51:55] an animal was offered a substitutionary
[51:58] death but the blood of bulls and goats
[52:01] as Hebrews here said just previous to
[52:04] where I read cannot take away sin it
[52:06] only covered it it was a perpetuation
[52:09] truly but it just covered sin for it was
[52:12] speaking with a good conscience looking
[52:15] forward to when the blood would come
[52:18] that would cleanse sin and or divorce it
[52:20] or put it totally
[52:21] away
[52:24] now Hebrews 10:4 says it's not possible
[52:29] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[52:32] take away
[52:34] sin all right you could only cover it
[52:38] right but don't lose the point now we're
[52:42] trying to go on to
[52:44] Perfection a Perfection that is beyond
[52:47] Perfection but just
[52:50] remember if you offered what God said
[52:52] you're perfect that's right that's what
[52:55] he said about
[52:59] Job God was he's bragging about it have
[53:02] you considered my servant
[53:04] Jo man is just and
[53:08] upright that's why when he sat there
[53:10] before those three guys that was trying
[53:12] to condemn him he said I'm not
[53:15] guilty they said a God wouldn't do to
[53:18] you what he's doing if you wasn't guilty
[53:20] he said I've offered the
[53:22] offering it proved later that he had he
[53:24] had even offered the offering for his
[53:26] children that's how perfect the
[53:28] atonement would be he had even made an
[53:30] offering for his children remember right
[53:33] said pre- Adventure they've done wrong
[53:35] you know what there was what seven of
[53:38] them and they were killed right he lost
[53:40] all of his animals lost all the
[53:45] things but when God finished it up
[53:47] showing he was right he got his seven
[53:50] children back for seven children here
[53:52] and he got the seven over there the
[53:54] prophet said that's right and he got
[53:56] double for everything he
[53:58] had is perfect
[54:01] right but you see we only dealing with
[54:04] we only think about perfection is
[54:05] through Jesus Christ that's what I'm
[54:07] trying to show you right the atonement
[54:09] spoke of Jesus
[54:12] Christ every atonement that was made
[54:15] spoke of Jesus Christ that's
[54:19] right all right
[54:24] then
[54:25] we look at Perfection as to think that
[54:29] it's to be born again that's
[54:35] wonderful but is that all you know about
[54:41] perfection what about perfection if God
[54:45] required
[54:47] it now back this Matthew 5:48 brother R
[54:50] said if God required that said he had to
[54:52] make a way right said he did
[54:55] to his own self
[54:58] right now everything looking forward to
[55:01] Calvary
[55:03] right but I want to read one more
[55:06] scripture I want you to read with me
[55:08] look at Exodus
[55:13] 32 look at Exodus
[55:21] 32 now verse
[55:24] 30
[55:26] now this is when the children of Israel
[55:28] had sinned and the thing that went wrong
[55:30] and and our about the C and and whatever
[55:33] and you know making the C and the
[55:35] different things and he comes down and
[55:37] what did he
[55:41] say and it came to pass on the marrow
[55:43] that Moses said unto the
[55:45] people you have sinned a great
[55:49] sin and now I will go up unto the
[55:52] Lord pray Adventure
[55:56] I shall make an atonement for your
[56:04] sins are you reading
[56:08] it you after on the internet and things
[56:10] are you reading
[56:11] it I'm reading in your
[56:14] scriptures
[56:16] what
[56:18] offering did Moses offer
[56:23] right
[56:32] what offering did he
[56:36] offer he said you
[56:39] sin this was the golden cave and all of
[56:42] the horrible right he said I'll go
[56:45] before God that's right and pre
[56:50] Adventure I shall make an
[56:53] atonement see your first time thought
[56:55] would be you'd say that Moses is
[56:58] saying well now God and now the people I
[57:01] I'm going to go up here and I'm going to
[57:03] offer an atonement and maybe some
[57:06] way if I get the right one you'll be all
[57:13] right but where's the atonement he made
[57:21] right see we're going to find out what
[57:23] Perfection is right
[57:27] oh
[57:28] my we're going to find out those Old
[57:31] Testament
[57:32] Saints as long as they followed that
[57:34] word and done what it's doing that's
[57:41] perfect go perfect means not
[57:47] guilty see we think a perfect is some
[57:50] kind of a you
[57:52] know oh look at that that's
[57:55] perfect we got our eyes on some kind of
[57:57] a scale that makes it that
[58:01] way but where's the atonement that Moses
[58:08] made that's all I'm asking you right
[58:14] amen now where you catch on real quick
[58:16] brother Joe pull it back up and we'll
[58:18] follow own
[58:20] right I want to ask you a simple
[58:23] question
[58:28] which is the most
[58:34] important the atonement that was
[58:36] actually
[58:40] made or the word of God that said to
[58:43] make the
[58:47] atonement I don't go wrong with me all
[58:50] right I say that to click people where
[58:52] they won't than they so you don't run it
[58:54] don't go
[58:57] wrong I know the atonement had to be
[58:59] made
[59:01] right right come on that offer the
[59:05] offering I just got to covering that if
[59:07] you didn't you got in
[59:09] trouble right you was in trouble with
[59:12] God if you didn't make the atonement
[59:14] that was said to be made come
[59:16] on but I'm asking you a question what
[59:19] atonement did Moses
[59:23] make
[59:31] there's no record there that he took in
[59:33] the handful
[59:37] no okay can you pull that back up
[59:39] brother
[59:46] Jo look at verse
[59:53] 39
[59:56] let's go drop it down if you can let's
[59:58] I'm going to go back over verse
[1:00:01] 30 this 32:30 and it came to pass on the
[1:00:05] mar that Moses said unto the people you
[1:00:06] have sin a great sin and now I will go
[1:00:09] up unto the Lord pray Adventure I shall
[1:00:11] make an atonement for your sins and
[1:00:13] Moses returned unto the Lord and
[1:00:16] said oh this people have sent a great
[1:00:18] sin and have made them gods of
[1:00:22] gold I want
[1:00:28] yet now
[1:00:31] all if thou Willl not forgive their sins
[1:00:36] sin and if not BL me I pray thee out of
[1:00:41] the book which thou has
[1:00:49] written sure we go on with the rest of
[1:00:51] it then the Lord said unto Moses
[1:00:53] whosoever sinned against me him will I
[1:00:54] blot out of my
[1:00:57] book therefore now go lead the people
[1:01:00] under the place which I have spoken to
[1:01:02] you behold my angel shall go before thee
[1:01:04] nonetheless in the day when I visit I
[1:01:06] will visit their sin upon them and the
[1:01:08] Lord plagued the people because they
[1:01:10] made the C which a and
[1:01:14] me but do you see what I'm talking about
[1:01:17] can you look right there and see what
[1:01:18] I'm talking
[1:01:21] about what atonement did he make
[1:01:29] brother R said he wondered about that
[1:01:31] right right bring the others up brothers
[1:01:35] let's get this then we'll get on down to
[1:01:37] more to the
[1:01:40] point number
[1:01:42] five 54 the 2 SE 63
[1:01:46] 3:19 there Moses took the place of
[1:01:48] Christ amen then to throw himself in the
[1:01:51] breach and said don't do it Lord
[1:01:55] see and of
[1:01:57] course he after he ordained Moses to do
[1:02:01] it to do
[1:02:03] this and read
[1:02:06] it he didn't come over
[1:02:09] Moses right because he was acting like
[1:02:13] Christ in that time it was Christ in
[1:02:16] Moses absolutely
[1:02:19] right Moses was ordained to bring the
[1:02:22] word of God
[1:02:26] a man that went up on a mountain and
[1:02:29] stayed just prior to this scripture to
[1:02:32] get to 10 commandments to bring them
[1:02:35] down 40 days and 40 nights without water
[1:02:38] or drink you know food no man can live
[1:02:41] like
[1:02:46] that look at what the prophet said he
[1:02:48] was acting like Christ in that time God
[1:02:51] couldn't go over
[1:02:53] Moses
[1:02:57] okay souls in prison paragraph
[1:03:02] 116 there was a scripture that always
[1:03:05] puzzled me how that Moses could tell God
[1:03:07] a better way than God had till I found
[1:03:10] out that it was the spirit of Christ in
[1:03:12] Moses
[1:03:14] see going down to the last
[1:03:17] one paragraph 83 Look Away under
[1:03:22] Jesus and there was another one that
[1:03:24] puzzled
[1:03:26] me that was when Moses could tell God a
[1:03:29] better way than God know how to do
[1:03:31] anything when Moses said the people will
[1:03:34] say now this is tied together two
[1:03:36] different scriptures if you understand
[1:03:38] your scriptures CU this is the this is
[1:03:40] one here that we're dealing with but the
[1:03:42] other one is when you know he goes
[1:03:44] before him and he's actually says it and
[1:03:46] I bring it out the other day your God
[1:03:48] was able to bring them out but not able
[1:03:50] to keep you and Moses threw himself in
[1:03:52] the breach then later I found found out
[1:03:55] that Moses that was Christ and Moses
[1:03:58] standing for the
[1:04:01] people
[1:04:07] now the Salvation lay in the
[1:04:15] atonement or the Salvation lay in the
[1:04:17] one who required
[1:04:23] it
[1:04:30] you better lay in the one that required
[1:04:32] it because if not then your idea is like
[1:04:35] I used to
[1:04:37] have I used to think that ever Israelite
[1:04:40] was saved why cuz he made it
[1:04:43] own you didn't take that
[1:04:46] away you know they done what God
[1:04:50] Said So here comes a guy and he just
[1:04:53] walks up and he just grabs L he CL it
[1:04:55] down he said kill it I'm going off and
[1:04:56] do it
[1:04:57] again now was he
[1:05:05] forgiven why was it the almighty God
[1:05:08] would
[1:05:10] say my nostrils is sick of your
[1:05:16] sacrifice I'm fed up with him
[1:05:23] right
[1:05:25] who do you look to
[1:05:26] Lord he said I look to a man with an
[1:05:28] honest and a contrite
[1:05:30] heart we'll get to that scripture in a
[1:05:32] minute CU there a few more words after
[1:05:36] that but what do you think about
[1:05:40] it we know that was Christ in
[1:05:45] Moses so really where was the offering
[1:05:48] Moses
[1:05:49] made did he take a lamb lay it up he l
[1:05:53] no no
[1:05:56] he reminded God of his
[1:06:04] word God had said he was going to take
[1:06:06] the people
[1:06:10] in God had told
[1:06:17] Moses that the children of Israel was
[1:06:19] going to the promised
[1:06:22] land like brother said if God wanted to
[1:06:26] because he said God actually told him
[1:06:27] said just get out of the way that's the
[1:06:29] other one that's there there are two
[1:06:30] different scriptures he said just get
[1:06:32] out of the way I'll just destroy every
[1:06:34] one of them and I'll just take you and
[1:06:36] I'll raise up another
[1:06:41] nation and he could have done
[1:06:44] it but Moses reminded it
[1:06:48] right it will be said of you if you let
[1:06:50] all of them be destroyed that you could
[1:06:52] bring them out but you couldn't take
[1:06:53] them in
[1:06:58] I used to wonder about that I told you
[1:06:59] the other
[1:07:00] day I used to read that when I was in
[1:07:02] the
[1:07:04] Baptist no I like to read
[1:07:06] then and I think well how's this guy
[1:07:10] telling God a better way of doing
[1:07:11] something I didn't know the word better
[1:07:12] way of doing something or anything like
[1:07:14] brother R talking about I just knew that
[1:07:16] this man had some kind of a connection
[1:07:19] this man Moses he had some connection
[1:07:22] somewhere I guess it tickled at it with
[1:07:25] brother Tom faush he used to tell about
[1:07:28] when he was on that aircraft
[1:07:31] carrier and uh you know I mean you know
[1:07:34] how you the the uh the the commander
[1:07:38] what you call him you know of the boat I
[1:07:41] mean that's his boat that's why he's
[1:07:43] Alles to go down he's supposed to go
[1:07:44] down with the boat because if that boat
[1:07:46] goes down so far and everybody's
[1:07:49] abandoned it and it jumps back up by a
[1:07:52] big wave and ares itself and the
[1:07:54] captain's gone anybody that gets on
[1:07:56] there the boat belongs to
[1:07:59] them come on so the captain was supposed
[1:08:02] to go down with the
[1:08:06] ship that's how much Authority he had
[1:08:09] right he
[1:08:10] marry perform weddings do all kind of
[1:08:14] things he's just as much a president as
[1:08:16] anybody's a president cuz I said it's a
[1:08:18] little country right that's right and
[1:08:20] butd everybody saluted
[1:08:22] him
[1:08:24] my brother Tom told about this one guy
[1:08:26] and he said I don't know what in the
[1:08:27] world he had on that
[1:08:29] Captain he said but I never seen him
[1:08:31] salute
[1:08:34] him he said every time we come you know
[1:08:37] we oh we pop we saluted CL he with he
[1:08:42] said Captain walk up and I don't God H
[1:08:44] call his first name I don't remember
[1:08:46] what it was but say hey Sam how you
[1:08:49] doing don't cap say doing great
[1:08:52] Joe
[1:08:55] he said I don't know what he had on him
[1:08:57] but he said he never saluted the
[1:09:00] captain and my point is
[1:09:03] what he had
[1:09:07] something to keep him
[1:09:10] covered either something he knew about
[1:09:12] the captain or
[1:09:15] whatever he had something that kept him
[1:09:21] covered that's what I used to think
[1:09:22] about Moses
[1:09:24] Moses what what do you
[1:09:27] got when you can actually tell God but
[1:09:31] what was he doing he was reminding god
[1:09:34] of what he had
[1:09:36] said with no special deal he was just he
[1:09:40] was no special guy
[1:09:43] right when he's ready to kill him over
[1:09:46] there
[1:09:50] right God would have killed him mhm
[1:09:54] but yet
[1:09:57] see Moses just knew the
[1:10:03] word there's Christ that's
[1:10:06] right there was the atonement that Moses
[1:10:09] said pre
[1:10:11] Adventure I can make an
[1:10:14] atonement so
[1:10:16] Lord if you're going to block them out
[1:10:20] right if you won't forgive them
[1:10:24] just take me
[1:10:27] right he said
[1:10:30] Moses I can't come over you right I
[1:10:34] ordained you for the
[1:10:36] job I can't come over
[1:10:39] you take them moment right sure later he
[1:10:42] finally had to say Moses because of all
[1:10:45] the problems
[1:10:47] right you didn't sanctify me back there
[1:10:50] when it was about the water I mean about
[1:10:52] you the the speaking of the word that
[1:10:55] you didn't speak the word so now I'm not
[1:10:56] going to let you go in Promised Land you
[1:10:58] got to wait about 800 years and then you
[1:11:00] can take a little trip by there he
[1:11:03] did Joshua had to take them in would you
[1:11:07] see Christ in
[1:11:09] Moses that could actually remind
[1:11:13] god of what he said so which one is the
[1:11:19] greatest the atonement that was
[1:11:22] made
[1:11:24] literally you know of what God Said are
[1:11:28] the word of the one that told
[1:11:31] it I remind you of what I've tried to
[1:11:34] get you to see for many about 40
[1:11:36] something years
[1:11:39] now what took care of Adam and Eve in
[1:11:42] the garden right before God made the
[1:11:46] atonement
[1:11:47] right is it click and read right what
[1:11:50] took care of him amen what took care of
[1:11:54] with Adam and Eve before God come in and
[1:11:56] made the
[1:12:00] atonement cuz God had done told
[1:12:03] them
[1:12:05] multiply and replenish the Earth that's
[1:12:09] right he could not change that
[1:12:13] right that's
[1:12:15] right are you
[1:12:18] listening we think Perfection would lay
[1:12:21] then where's your Perfection lay does it
[1:12:23] lay in the fact that you took up so many
[1:12:27] animals cuz if one animal was good why
[1:12:30] not give them two you
[1:12:32] know right right I mean one atones let
[1:12:36] me put two I get a double atonement just
[1:12:40] in case something goes
[1:12:45] wrong are you
[1:12:47] listening it wasn't just Moses standing
[1:12:52] there
[1:12:54] it was a word that's
[1:12:57] right that had wrote five books
[1:13:01] right A
[1:13:03] Man Called
[1:13:06] Moses if somebody made a
[1:13:10] requirement and you keep
[1:13:13] it
[1:13:16] you then it's dependent upon his word
[1:13:22] right right all
[1:13:26] right there's a law here in America that
[1:13:29] you cannot try a man twice for the same
[1:13:31] crime it's called double jeopardy every
[1:13:34] how you pronounce those big words
[1:13:36] amen and somebody triy to take you to
[1:13:39] court about something and the judge says
[1:13:41] you can't do it the law says you can't
[1:13:44] try him
[1:13:45] twice
[1:13:48] right the
[1:13:50] word had said it
[1:13:54] the word said in Genesis I put enmity
[1:13:57] between thy seed and the seed of the
[1:13:59] woman could it ever fail if that not
[1:14:01] come to P that's
[1:14:04] right so what is really the
[1:14:11] atonement that's God's
[1:14:16] word don't you think God will keep his
[1:14:19] word see I know now come on you got to
[1:14:22] make your tement we had to do it they
[1:14:24] had to do it Aaron had to go in once a
[1:14:26] year he had to do those but he was doing
[1:14:28] what Moses
[1:14:33] said but Moses was telling them what God
[1:14:40] Said see Moses here it was his
[1:14:44] words that made the atonement for the
[1:14:46] people that was the real
[1:14:52] Christ
[1:14:55] that was not just the spirit of Christ
[1:14:57] that was the real Christ
[1:15:03] right cuz I thought we
[1:15:06] believed that Christ was the
[1:15:09] Loos
[1:15:12] theophany word that come out of
[1:15:18] God in the beginning the son of
[1:15:22] God
[1:15:31] what about the words of a man how
[1:15:32] powerful are they that's right that's
[1:15:37] it that's right let me remind you of a
[1:15:41] man in our
[1:15:46] day the people kept asking him questions
[1:15:49] about marriage and
[1:15:52] divorce
[1:15:56] he said I got the
[1:15:59] scriptures he said it'll bust every
[1:16:01] Church in the in the
[1:16:04] world am
[1:16:09] quoting said Lord what can I
[1:16:13] do he said go up in the mountain I'm
[1:16:16] going talk to
[1:16:21] you a man
[1:16:24] right went into a
[1:16:29] mountain they had preach to
[1:16:32] seals and brought us the
[1:16:36] word The Ten Commandments had come down
[1:16:39] the message had come the seals had been
[1:16:47] broke the man said what can I
[1:16:50] do go up in the mountain and I talk to
[1:16:57] you he comes back off of thereon and he
[1:16:59] says because of Mis interpreted
[1:17:02] theology Y and this is a question in
[1:17:06] God's
[1:17:07] word not a question like a
[1:17:11] question but everybody questioned
[1:17:18] it the Pharisees questioned it in the
[1:17:21] scripture we just read in Matthew we
[1:17:23] started if you'll go back
[1:17:26] over it's a little bit back from where
[1:17:28] we read there in Matthew that's what
[1:17:29] they were talking to Jesus about Mar and
[1:17:39] divorce he said but I say unto you
[1:17:42] that's
[1:17:43] right tell them to go home as they
[1:17:47] are not do it again
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:55] he brought us the
[1:17:57] word that's right so that would have
[1:18:00] been Christ standing
[1:18:02] there the brother random said that means
[1:18:04] you're taking the place of God he said
[1:18:09] yeah what could he say cuz he was
[1:18:14] right what could he answer cuz he
[1:18:19] was was Moses God no right was Christ in
[1:18:24] Moses right was brother brandom God
[1:18:27] no it was Christ in brother brandom
[1:18:30] right who forgave our
[1:18:33] sins only Christ can forgive sins that's
[1:18:39] right the
[1:18:43] atonement what is the
[1:18:48] atonement everything that we depend upon
[1:18:51] is based upon what some man say
[1:18:58] am right right right you and I are here
[1:19:01] tonight because of what somebody said
[1:19:04] some
[1:19:08] man do we believe it was
[1:19:11] God that's right or was it just the
[1:19:13] words of a
[1:19:14] man if it was the words of the man of a
[1:19:17] man we're still in our
[1:19:19] sins you wouldn't back there and I
[1:19:22] wouldn't back there to 2,000 years when
[1:19:23] Jesus Christ died so you don't know
[1:19:26] whether it's true or not
[1:19:29] right said Brother
[1:19:31] D well you
[1:19:33] don't what proof have you
[1:19:38] got the main proof that I've got that he
[1:19:42] died is it changed from the
[1:19:47] Beatitudes into the
[1:19:51] similitudes of a light
[1:19:53] right in our hearts and
[1:19:57] lives and that I can stand and look at
[1:20:00] people and they say brother Dale I've
[1:20:02] got a lot of
[1:20:05] problems I don't have much of an answer
[1:20:07] for you but we know a God that
[1:20:10] does so just hang onen cuz where AR you
[1:20:14] going amen come
[1:20:16] on I mean what else you going to
[1:20:19] do just hang on Amen Lord
[1:20:24] believe
[1:20:27] God cuz in the beginning was the word
[1:20:31] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:20:33] God Amen and the Word was made flesh and
[1:20:36] dwell Among Us am
[1:20:39] right Moses was God to the
[1:20:43] people right that's right because the
[1:20:46] word came to
[1:20:48] Moses
[1:20:51] right didn't Jesus Jesus say you you're
[1:20:53] talking to me about these things that
[1:20:55] doesn't your own scriptural teaching say
[1:20:57] that you are that the word comes
[1:21:00] to
[1:21:02] come the children of God the prophets
[1:21:05] and the
[1:21:07] thing what about it
[1:21:11] right we look at the
[1:21:13] atonement but you can just go though he
[1:21:15] lay down Mak an atonement does that mean
[1:21:17] you're
[1:21:20] saved we believe in message
[1:21:24] yeah where's the similitude right oh my
[1:21:29] where's the likeness of the message come
[1:21:31] on when you know yourself in this
[1:21:33] message what it is is is 98% of the
[1:21:36] preachers beating the people over the
[1:21:39] head and scaring them to death and
[1:21:41] telling them they got to stay with them
[1:21:43] or they won't be saved oh no they don't
[1:21:46] preach it that way brother Dale well
[1:21:48] you're to
[1:21:50] listen that's right that's what gets me
[1:21:54] I stand up here and warn you and warn
[1:21:55] you about brothers and certain doctrines
[1:21:57] and and then some of you will start this
[1:21:59] talking and there comes their Doctrine
[1:22:01] right out of your mouth and me warning
[1:22:03] you not to listen to
[1:22:06] that see then when I say it like that
[1:22:08] you don't want me to listen
[1:22:10] to listen to all you want
[1:22:15] to but why don't you listen with open
[1:22:20] ears if I say something
[1:22:26] wrong right you let me say something
[1:22:29] wrong you let me make a wrong quote and
[1:22:32] outside somebody will be there after
[1:22:35] me said you missed it right here oh
[1:22:44] my which is the greatest the
[1:22:47] atonement are the words of the one who
[1:22:50] said make the atonement that's
[1:22:54] right I leave that with
[1:22:57] you think on these
[1:23:00] things what is
[1:23:05] perfection the Father the revealed
[1:23:09] word stand come
[1:23:12] on take on these
[1:23:17] sign be therefore perfect even as your
[1:23:20] father in Heaven is perfect
[1:23:23] is that just a quote throw it in a bunch
[1:23:25] of
[1:23:26] scriptures or was it like what I was
[1:23:30] saying that even the publicans and
[1:23:33] things will do these things aren't you
[1:23:34] greater than they are if you want to be
[1:23:36] the children of your father if you want
[1:23:38] to be perfect father what the perfect
[1:23:39] one
[1:23:41] says is that
[1:23:44] right do what the one says that knows
[1:23:47] how to make us
[1:23:49] perfect cuz I'll state it again you can
[1:23:51] say there's none of us perfect if God
[1:23:55] says I am you talk to
[1:24:00] him I have no
[1:24:03] problem I know I'm not worth nothing I
[1:24:05] know what what you're looking at is a
[1:24:07] garbage
[1:24:09] can I'm the first to admit
[1:24:12] that but if God says I'm perfect you
[1:24:15] better say what he says are you're a
[1:24:18] liar right
[1:24:21] sorry cuz you see that's what I look
[1:24:23] back at
[1:24:26] you and you tell me God has forgiven me
[1:24:30] I see God Is Forgiven
[1:24:34] you well now I don't see how that could
[1:24:37] be because what you really done you done
[1:24:39] it against me and if you come tell me
[1:24:41] about it that's where them preachers are
[1:24:43] you watch them in the pull pit you watch
[1:24:45] people in the congregation they want
[1:24:46] that microphone to stay on where they
