[22:05] something that brother Donnie said while

[22:10] praying and I was like well Lord I just
[22:13] think that must be your confirmation
[22:16] for me to speak on this and because I'd
[22:20] already I'd looked at this and I'd
[22:22] preached on it before and I got to look
[22:23] on it and it just
[22:25] seemed like this is the way the Lord
[22:26] wanted us to go so
[22:28] y'all just pray for me tonight and we'll
[22:30] uh
[22:31] look at a few things tonight but uh
[22:34] let's just all bow our heads and speak

[24:36] amen
[24:38] in Ephesians chapter 4
[24:40] it begins verse 11. and it says and he
[24:43] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[24:45] some evangelists and some pastors and
[24:47] teachers for the perfecting of the
[24:49] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[24:50] the edifying of the body of Christ
[24:54] till we all come in the unity of the
[24:56] faith
[24:57] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[25:01] I don't know I don't know where people
[25:02] get the idea that the fivefold
[25:04] Ministries job Runs Out
[25:08] uh you know as as long as nobody as long
[25:12] as everybody's not come to Unity of
[25:13] Faith we've got a job to do
[25:17] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[25:19] unto a perfect man
[25:22] unto the measure of the stature the
[25:24] fullness of Christ
[25:26] so if we come to Unity of the faith and
[25:28] the knowledge the Son of God and it
[25:31] brings us into the stature of the
[25:32] fullness of Christ
[25:35] we got a job
[25:38] he said that we henceforth be no more
[25:40] children tossed to and fro and be
[25:41] carried about with every wind of
[25:42] Doctrine by the slight of men and Connie
[25:45] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[25:47] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[25:49] may grow up
[25:51] that's where I want to speak from they
[25:53] grow up into him
[25:55] and all things which is the head even
[25:56] Christ
[25:57] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[25:59] together and compacted by that which
[26:01] every joint supplies according to the
[26:03] effectual working in the measure of
[26:05] every part maketh increase of the body
[26:07] unto the edifying of itself in love
[26:11] in James 5
[26:12] verse 7 says be patient therefore
[26:14] brethren
[26:16] unto the coming of the Lord behold the
[26:18] husband and waiteth for the precious
[26:20] fruit of the earth and have long
[26:22] patience for it until he received the
[26:25] early and latter ring amen God bless you
[26:28] may be seated tonight
[26:30] and I just want to speak on this little
[26:33] thought about spiritual cultivation and
[26:40] I really enjoyed what brother
[26:42] Ryan had to say about
[26:47] you know all of our our relationships
[26:50] and everything
[26:52] there has to be work
[26:54] and it has to be
[26:57] there has to be cultivating of all these
[26:59] things and
[27:01] you know everything if you if you if it
[27:04] means something to you if it matters to
[27:07] you then you know it takes time it takes
[27:10] effort everything in life that big holes
[27:13] there's many people you know they're out
[27:15] to try to find a uh a quick way of
[27:18] getting something they want to get rich
[27:20] quick scheme and you know there's no
[27:22] such thing as that
[27:24] I mean if you if you want to develop
[27:27] into any kind of
[27:30] any kind of person
[27:33] any kind of
[27:34] skill it takes time
[27:38] you know everything you know to even
[27:39] even growing up you know because
[27:43] you know it there's an old saying that
[27:45] many people have and you know everybody
[27:47] they talk about pulling themselves up by
[27:50] their bootstraps
[27:51] and everybody thinks they're a self-made
[27:53] man well there was somebody that said
[27:55] one time he said well who who gave you
[27:57] the boots with the bootstraps
[27:59] so you had to have something somebody
[28:01] had to start you had to start somewhere
[28:03] you know you're just not a self-made man
[28:05] it takes I mean but you do have to put
[28:07] effort into it it takes something but
[28:09] you know what it takes you have to have
[28:11] some help to get there
[28:13] and I want to look at this word uh
[28:16] cultivate cultivation and also uh
[28:20] from from James here it talks about the
[28:23] husband and waited for the precious
[28:25] fruit
[28:26] the word cultivate means to Foster the
[28:29] growth of to improve my labor care or
[28:32] study to refine to free something from
[28:35] such as a metal sugar or oil from
[28:37] impurities or unwanted material to free
[28:40] from moral imperfection to elevate
[28:43] to improve or Perfect by pruning or
[28:46] polishing to further or to encourage
[28:51] now this is the word uh
[28:54] husbandman
[28:56] and husbandman says one whose Talent is
[29:00] to cultivate the ground
[29:03] and it says in the in the Old Testament
[29:08] here it says the word husbandman comes
[29:11] from the Hebrew word
[29:13] Adama
[29:14] which means land or of the earth which
[29:16] is the same Hebrew word
[29:18] from which we get the word Adam the name
[29:20] of the first man whom God placed in Eden
[29:22] to work and to care for it
[29:27] and then the scripture Genesis 2 15 it
[29:30] says and the Lord God took the man and
[29:33] put him in the Garden of Eden to dress
[29:34] it and to keep it
[29:36] it says Jesus compared God to a
[29:38] husbandman in John 15 1-2 says I am the
[29:41] vine and my father is the husbandman
[29:43] every branch in me that beareth not
[29:45] fruit he taketh away in every branch
[29:47] that bearth fruit he purgeth it that it
[29:51] may bring forth more fruit
[29:53] so we know that in the in the scripture
[29:57] we know that um one of the in the you
[30:00] know in the Old Testament
[30:03] um the if you did not have a
[30:08] a religious job everybody that was
[30:11] everybody was was a husbandman everybody
[30:14] worked in the fields and everybody
[30:15] everybody had that kind of occupation
[30:18] everybody uh was of it worked in tilling
[30:22] the ground and taking care of all those
[30:23] things and
[30:24] um
[30:26] you know what everybody had to do all
[30:28] all of all those things so it was really
[30:30] a really an important ish a part of uh
[30:35] the lives of of the people in the old in
[30:38] the Old Testament and
[30:40] um you know a lot of the types and
[30:43] things we see in the Old Testament all
[30:44] come from from that kind of life and
[30:47] tilling the ground and all that and
[30:49] the Scripture it talks about the purging
[30:53] of the of the fruit as we was reading
[30:55] here in John and it says a good
[30:58] husbandman worketh the Earth he
[31:00] cultivates plants and naturally expects
[31:03] them to produce fruit
[31:06] commiserate with the amount of effort he
[31:10] has invested in them
[31:12] so when you put in the this amount of
[31:15] work you expect something out of it
[31:18] because if you're going to put in the
[31:20] work then you expect something to come
[31:22] out of it you know because like brother
[31:25] Wade spends a lot of time tilling the
[31:27] ground in in the early part of the you
[31:30] know May June
[31:32] April whatever it whatever months it is
[31:34] when he starts tilling the ground and
[31:36] getting everything ready well you know
[31:38] there's a lot of hours and a lot of
[31:40] labor involved in all of that because
[31:43] he's expecting something to come from
[31:45] all of that and so there either you put
[31:48] in all this and he says our heavenly
[31:50] father the Divine husband seeks to
[31:52] produce fruit through us as we abide in
[31:55] Christ
[31:56] so as we are in Christ then God has laid
[32:00] out a plan for us to bring forth much
[32:03] fruit just as the scripture says here he
[32:05] is the vine we are the branches and if
[32:08] we're the branches then we're the ones
[32:09] that are to Bear the fruit and he he is
[32:12] the husband and He is wanting us to be
[32:14] abide in Christ and then if he's if
[32:17] we're in Christ then we are a new
[32:19] creature then we are to bring forth the
[32:21] fruit
[32:21] of the work that God has done because
[32:24] it's no longer I that live it's no
[32:26] longer I doing the work but it's Christ
[32:28] doing the work in me and if he's doing
[32:31] the work then he is supposed to be
[32:32] manifested in us the work that he does
[32:35] is working through us that should be
[32:36] bringing forth this fruit and he said
[32:39] just as God is a good husband and
[32:41] bringeth forth fruitfulness in our lives
[32:43] we should be good husbandmen with the
[32:46] resources he has entrusted to us
[32:51] so this is a few things I want to I want
[32:54] to look at
[32:55] later on but kind of just laying a
[32:58] background here about understanding
[33:00] about this about cultivating and being a
[33:03] husband and understanding what
[33:05] what these things are and brother
[33:07] Brandon was speaking here in the message
[33:09] the end times seed sign
[33:11] Ed seed and he was talking about the
[33:15] Bible this is a quote number one
[33:18] brothers and and says he says I read in
[33:20] the Bible heavens and earth will pass
[33:22] away but God's word shall not pass away
[33:25] he said I read in the Bible that
[33:27] whatsoever
[33:28] and whosoever shall take anything out or
[33:30] add anything to it his part will be
[33:32] taken out of the book of life that
[33:34] stands just the way it is many try to
[33:36] say it's been tampered with it's been
[33:38] done this way or that way I do not
[33:40] believe that
[33:41] I believe there's got to be some kind of
[33:44] a standard that God will judge the
[33:46] church by or the world there's got to be
[33:49] some standard it cannot be in church
[33:52] organization because they different
[33:55] who would say who would know what to do
[33:58] but there is a standard and that's his
[34:00] word I believe that God wants watches
[34:03] over his word I believe that that word
[34:05] is punctuated exactly the way God wants
[34:08] it
[34:09] the Bible
[34:10] it's God's word to the people
[34:12] there's where the reason I believe in
[34:14] that word and I believe the word is a
[34:16] seed
[34:17] and if that seed is sowed in the right
[34:19] ground and watered by the Holy Spirit
[34:21] it'll bring forth of its kind any
[34:24] promise of God will do it
[34:28] and so you know I believe that
[34:31] you know I believe that God has a
[34:33] standard and this is God's standard and
[34:36] God wants us as brother Ryan was talking
[34:39] about you know getting into the word and
[34:41] studying the word and and becoming one
[34:43] with the word
[34:45] and study in the word and and getting
[34:47] into the word and meditating on the word
[34:49] and it becoming a part of you and you
[34:52] know every part it was really good to
[34:55] you know to hear brother Ryan talk about
[34:57] you know the issues that he had in his
[34:59] life the struggles that he had in his
[35:01] life when he got into the word of God
[35:04] and the word of God became a important
[35:07] part and it's become such a foundation
[35:09] of his life of everything he done was in
[35:12] the word that was that was his top post
[35:15] to come back to the word and it becomes
[35:17] such an important part of him then when
[35:19] he become because he had these struggles
[35:21] in his life but when the word becomes
[35:23] something that was important to him and
[35:25] more important than anything else it
[35:27] become because it became life to him
[35:29] then all of a sudden through that he was
[35:31] able to overcome the struggles that he
[35:33] had the problems and the and the things
[35:35] that he had to face in life that he was
[35:37] able to overcome it because you cannot
[35:39] overcome these things in your own your
[35:41] by in yourself you're not able to
[35:43] overcome these things but praise God he
[35:45] give us the word to overcome by
[35:47] amen and if we'll take him at his word
[35:49] then you know we can overcome
[35:54] see we have to trust God if we can trust
[35:57] him
[35:58] he says
[36:03] he says
[36:04] this is from Jehovah Jireh
[36:07] he says look old brother he said when
[36:10] that Holy Spirit come up into that vine
[36:12] and produce from oh I'm sorry
[36:16] I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself
[36:18] I'm sorry but uh what what I wanted to
[36:21] I was I was getting ready to read this
[36:23] and brother random speaking here and
[36:26] he's speaking of
[36:28] uh here in Jehovah Jireh this is where
[36:30] brother Brandon is actually speaking of
[36:32] going and seeing the tree
[36:35] I believe it was in Arizona he was in he
[36:37] went to go see the tree that the brother
[36:39] had and it had all of the citrus fruits
[36:41] in it
[36:43] and he sees this tree and he's
[36:45] fascinated by this tree and he sees all
[36:48] of these different all these different
[36:50] fruits living off the same life of this
[36:52] tree and he's sitting there and he's
[36:54] like well how is this possible that we
[36:56] can see all of this fruit growing on all
[36:58] these trees and all this fruit is
[37:00] thriving in this tree and he sees this
[37:03] and he's and he starts asking the
[37:05] brother about this and he was like
[37:06] because they're all citrus fruit they're
[37:08] living off the Citrus life and he said
[37:11] because and he was saying so
[37:13] will they bring forth oranges later on
[37:15] he's like no he said whatever that
[37:17] branch is that's what they're going to
[37:18] bring forth because that's the life
[37:20] that's tied to that tree he said they're
[37:22] still living off the same life but he
[37:24] said as long as that that branch is tied
[37:27] to that tree it'll grow whatever that
[37:28] branch is and he was saying so they had
[37:31] the lemons and the tangerines and
[37:33] everything else was growing and it was
[37:34] thriving it was wonderful but he was
[37:36] like but what how you know what will
[37:38] take place and that man told him the
[37:40] brother told him he said listen he said
[37:41] if it ever brings forth another Branch
[37:44] if it ever brings forth an original
[37:46] Branch from the tree then it will always
[37:49] bring forth oranges because it's an
[37:51] orange tree but you can tie into that
[37:54] you can you can be grafted in you can
[37:57] you can live off that life but it'll
[37:59] never be exactly what God created it to
[38:01] be
[38:02] and that's the reason you can't have you
[38:04] can you know have be tied in and that's
[38:07] the reason you you can have the life and
[38:10] you see things that that take place but
[38:12] it's not the original life it's not the
[38:15] plan of God but people have tied in
[38:17] denominations and and their own ideas
[38:19] into the end of the life of God and you
[38:21] see things take place but it's not
[38:23] original it's not correct
[38:26] and that's what brother Brandon was
[38:28] talking about he said see he said
[38:29] brother when that Holy Spirit come upon
[38:32] that vine It produced from its Vine we
[38:34] was talking about the bride tree the
[38:38] restoration of the broad tree and
[38:40] produced from its Vine to the very
[38:42] Branch he said they wrote a book of Acts
[38:45] behind it
[38:46] he said if that tree ever puts forth
[38:49] another original limb she'll grow the
[38:51] same thing it'll be Jesus Christ
[38:54] he said now we've got Methodist
[38:56] Presbyterian Baptist Lutheran such
[39:01] he said bearing denominational fruit
[39:04] because if we ever puts forth another
[39:06] Branch she'll be a genuine christ-filled
[39:09] christ-centered word of God
[39:13] he said remember and he said remember
[39:14] about preaching the message on the the
[39:17] bride tree he said
[39:19] how that the husbandman come forth and
[39:22] it was bearing the wrong kind of fruit
[39:24] so he cut it off cut it off kept cutting
[39:27] it back cutting it back but Joel said
[39:29] what the Palmer worm left the canker
[39:31] poeter eaten and what the caterpillar
[39:35] left something else eating we find out
[39:37] them insects it's the same insects only
[39:40] in a different stage and what the
[39:42] Lutheran left the method has eaten what
[39:45] the Methodist left the Baptist eating
[39:47] what the Baptist left the Pentecostal
[39:49] Eden he said the whole thing is cut down
[39:52] but God said I will restore saith the
[39:55] Lord all the years I will send back
[39:57] another church in the last days I will
[40:00] restore the original Power again in the
[40:02] evening time it'll be like down in the
[40:05] heart of that tree no matter how many
[40:07] branches is pruned there will be there
[40:10] will come forth the Royal Seed of
[40:12] Abraham Hallelujah God promised it God
[40:14] will do it he said
[40:16] he would do it I will restore
[40:22] he says I will restore all the years
[40:23] that the denominations eat I will
[40:26] restore all the years I've pruned the
[40:28] thing off but yet there will come a vine
[40:31] out of the heart of it
[40:33] he'll be he'll be like a tree that's
[40:36] planted by the rivers of water a man
[40:38] that meditates in the word of God day
[40:40] and night not a Creed or a denomination
[40:43] but meditates in the word day and night
[40:46] he'll be like a tree that's planted by
[40:48] the river of water branches shall not
[40:51] wither he'll bring forth his fruit in
[40:54] this season God promised it
[41:01] so
[41:02] when he's speaking
[41:04] of what's taken place but we realize
[41:07] that we've had a message in our day that
[41:09] was a message of restoration
[41:12] and it was to bring back these things
[41:14] and that's what has come in our day
[41:16] we've received this message of
[41:17] restoration to bring back the fullness
[41:19] of the word that has been lost down
[41:21] Through the Ages and to bring us back
[41:23] and we have come to this place and
[41:26] we've come to this place of realizing
[41:28] who we are and what God has done for us
[41:31] that we have received the full word in
[41:33] our day
[41:34] that we have that it has been restored
[41:36] to us and all the things that that have
[41:38] been lost everything that has been
[41:40] confused on all these things God has
[41:42] restored to us and we can come back to
[41:44] the place where we can have the full
[41:46] word have the full assurance
[41:49] and and to know what God wants done with
[41:52] the word not what man has tried to take
[41:55] and and tried to uh tried to figure out
[41:58] on his own or anything like that but you
[42:00] know now we have thus saith the Lord we
[42:03] have what the true understanding the
[42:05] true revelation of the word is and so
[42:08] all these things have come that all of
[42:10] the denominational uh
[42:13] missteps and and all the confusion
[42:16] everything now has been gone away all
[42:18] these things have been taken away
[42:20] but the problem is is there's many
[42:22] people that have walked in in the word
[42:24] but the problem is is they've not walked
[42:26] in the full light of the word and you
[42:29] know they've walked in these things and
[42:30] because the light has has shown the
[42:33] light has increased and gotten greater
[42:35] but many people still walk in darkness
[42:37] and don't realize the day and the hour
[42:39] which we live
[42:41] when you begin to point people back to
[42:43] the word to show them that all the
[42:45] things all the confusion all the things
[42:47] that were wrong that were all through
[42:49] the All Through the Ages and when it
[42:50] came back to understand what the truth
[42:52] is people turn it down
[42:55] because they hold on to a denominational
[42:58] idea
[43:00] and what did Brother Madam say in the
[43:02] message the birth pains when he was
[43:03] talking about he said they want to
[43:04] sympathize with the word but they don't
[43:06] actually want to receive the word he
[43:08] said they want to sympathize with it but
[43:10] he said they don't want to take it they
[43:12] don't want to actually take it and rot
[43:15] away from their old denominational ideas
[43:17] and come to the message of the hour they
[43:20] don't want to take what the truth is
[43:22] even when people come to the place when
[43:24] you begin to show people what the truth
[43:26] is but you know I say brother Brandon
[43:28] was telling the story about the man and
[43:30] you know he was walking along the trail
[43:32] you know and he told Brother about him
[43:33] he said I don't agree with you on your
[43:35] Doctrine brother and you know brother
[43:36] random began to talk to him he was
[43:38] carrying that ladder and he said well
[43:39] how do you get home can you say you're
[43:40] home from here can you see the path do
[43:42] you know all the way he's like no but
[43:44] I've got a light this light that is
[43:46] shining in here is showing me step by
[43:48] step by step he said I know I've got a
[43:51] home there and all I got to do is walk
[43:53] step by step by step on that one on that
[43:55] path and it'll take me home he said well
[43:58] brother that's the way the word of God
[43:59] is he says you can't see it all but you
[44:01] got to start taking step by step by step
[44:04] if you will step if you just continue to
[44:06] walk in the light as God shows you the
[44:08] light you will continue to walk in the
[44:10] in the furtherance of the word
[44:13] but many times people have gotten to the
[44:15] place where they don't want to well I
[44:17] don't I don't know and you know and and
[44:19] they get into the place where they don't
[44:20] want to step out they don't want to
[44:22] stand on their own convictions they
[44:23] don't want to stand out and be be
[44:25] separate they don't want to they don't
[44:27] want to be an oddball they don't want to
[44:28] be and you know have to stand against
[44:31] the the
[44:33] all the things of the world
[44:38] why because people people just don't
[44:40] have a backbone sometimes they stand
[44:42] alone and stand for their own
[44:43] convictions
[44:47] and it's like you know people say well I
[44:49] you know I don't like to to be
[44:51] um people don't like to uh be where
[44:54] people don't like them
[44:56] but you know I'd rather I'd rather
[44:58] people hate me for who I am than people
[45:00] like me for for a phony version of me
[45:05] you know you know if you if you think
[45:07] I'm if I'm just an imitation if I'm just
[45:10] I'm just a fake then you know what
[45:12] nobody knows who you are
[45:15] because you know people you can put on
[45:18] and put on a good show for people but if
[45:21] it's not the truth if it's not who you
[45:22] are then you know what people don't even
[45:24] know who you are
[45:25] and really sometimes people get to the
[45:28] place where they don't even know who
[45:29] they are
[45:33] you know it's like like the old say it
[45:35] was a about the man and they
[45:37] you know it was a a preacher many years
[45:39] ago and they always talked about said
[45:41] when he was with the Oneness he was one
[45:42] this and when he was with the Tunis he
[45:45] was Tunis and when he was with the
[45:47] Trinity he was trinitarian and if you
[45:49] ever ask him how you baptized he said in
[45:51] water silly how else
[45:59] all you had to do was tell him what you
[46:01] wanted whatever you wanted him to preach
[46:03] and he could preach it
[46:07] I heard this man stand up and and he's
[46:09] told he's told multiple he's passed on
[46:11] now but he's told multiple people stood
[46:13] up and he said he believed that brother
[46:15] Bradham was Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4
[46:19] and I've heard him I sat in a detent
[46:22] meeting in his one of his meetings as a
[46:24] kid and heard the man stand up and say I
[46:26] didn't know the serpent had a seed
[46:31] and as a kid I I didn't know a whole lot
[46:34] but I understood exactly what he meant
[46:40] when he was why because when when people
[46:42] was paying the bills and everything like
[46:44] that he was not going to say that he
[46:46] believed brother Branham to be a prophet
[46:51] because whatever they but you know what
[46:52] when he got off by himself when it was
[46:54] one on one that people began to ask him
[46:56] questions and you know and they somebody
[46:57] asked him one time said why is it that
[46:59] you don't preach this message if you
[47:01] believe it if you've studied this
[47:02] message said why don't you preach this
[47:04] message he said that's for you younger
[47:05] men
[47:13] see
[47:15] people don't people want to want to have
[47:17] a meal ticket they want they want to
[47:19] do they just want to float along
[47:23] but you know what on the day of judgment
[47:26] you don't have anybody
[47:29] you have to give an account for yourself
[47:32] we have to give an account for I have to
[47:34] give an account from our myself we have
[47:35] to give an account for our own actions
[47:37] our own beliefs our own our own way of
[47:40] doing things everything that we've done
[47:42] we are we're responsible to that
[47:45] we're responsible in the way that we
[47:48] raise our children
[47:49] everything is responsible we're
[47:52] responsible to that
[47:58] so we have we have to
[48:00] lay out you know because sometimes it's
[48:02] it's not it's not easy to do what's
[48:04] right
[48:06] it's not fun to do what's right
[48:10] when raising when just like raising
[48:13] children you know
[48:15] you know we never want to believe when
[48:16] your parents tell you
[48:18] this is harder on me than it is on you
[48:25] you're lying
[48:27] until you become a parent
[48:32] and then you know what it breaks your
[48:33] heart sometimes
[48:37] it is it's because but you know you see
[48:39] when when you have the when you have
[48:42] this relationship and you begin to see
[48:44] this thing then you understand how God
[48:46] is
[48:49] you know as it was I believe brother
[48:52] Branham or brother Dale always said you
[48:54] know God chastises us with nail pierced
[48:57] hands
[49:00] you know how does how does God raise his
[49:04] children
[49:06] and how does he how does he look at
[49:08] things and many times I under I can
[49:11] honestly say I I'm not Christ's like
[49:15] because some sometimes that I get up and
[49:18] speak and unfortunately Dale Roberts is
[49:21] there
[49:24] like the older I get the more I see my
[49:25] dad
[49:28] I speak and sometimes it's like Dale
[49:30] Roberts
[49:31] I look in the mirror and I see Dale
[49:33] Roberts
[49:36] why because it's of the flesh
[49:40] and it's like well you know we we don't
[49:42] like to live that way but you know
[49:43] that's who we are
[49:45] and it's a battle you've got to overcome
[49:47] that
[49:50] and so you know many times you know we
[49:52] wish we wish we had just every time we'd
[49:54] open our mouth it would be the words of
[49:56] Christ we we would have the mind of
[49:58] Christ all the time and everything that
[50:00] we would say and everything that we
[50:01] would do would just be so
[50:03] christ-centered that we wouldn't have an
[50:04] issue
[50:07] but lots of times we don't do that
[50:11] Aaron Roberts shows up on the scene
[50:15] and then it was like Lord why did I say
[50:16] that
[50:17] why did I do that
[50:20] because that's the struggle
[50:25] and so we just continued to allow God to
[50:28] do the work in US
[50:31] and we realized every time we fail and
[50:33] we have faults and we have struggles
[50:35] realize you know we're not where we
[50:36] ought to be but praise God the Lord
[50:38] shows us in those times you need to Lean
[50:40] on Me
[50:41] you need to put your trust in me
[50:45] now it's time to move on from this
[50:50] are you happy where you're at
[50:53] no I'm not
[50:54] well what are you going to do about it
[50:58] well I don't want to do this again
[51:02] but that's what God does for us
[51:05] here in we read this earlier this is
[51:08] John chapter 15 verse 1. he says I am
[51:12] the True Vine and my father is the
[51:14] husbandman
[51:16] now this is from the message the
[51:17] restoration of the broad tree brother
[51:20] Brandon says see God is the good
[51:22] husbandman he pruned the tree that that
[51:26] was all cut off all the dead limbs he
[51:29] said what's he going to do burn them up
[51:33] up there exact God is the husbandman of
[51:36] the tree of this tree he takes care of
[51:38] it he watches over his heritage
[51:41] what is his Heritage his own word he
[51:44] watches over his word to confirm it to
[51:46] watch it see where it can get
[51:49] he's going to restore see when these
[51:52] churches begin to organize and things
[51:54] like that he just prunes them off and
[51:56] the church goes on
[51:59] and he said later on he says he is going
[52:01] to restore
[52:03] so we understand that God is the
[52:06] husbandman
[52:08] and one of the things I want to look at
[52:09] tonight about cultivating the
[52:13] um
[52:14] cultivating this the seed and the
[52:18] understanding about the husbandman
[52:20] you know uh God's talk you know brother
[52:23] Ram talks about God being the husbandman
[52:25] and he also talks about Christ being the
[52:28] husbandman
[52:29] and so there's and he also talks about
[52:32] the pastor being a husbandman and and
[52:35] different ones and so I just want to
[52:37] look at some of these things tonight but
[52:38] understand how God does the work
[52:42] and it continues on because the the
[52:45] scripture tells us that I didn't I
[52:47] didn't bring it but
[52:49] um he the scripture tells us you know
[52:51] that
[52:52] the ever the head of every man is Christ
[52:56] and the the head is over the wife and
[52:59] how all these things work together and
[53:02] so we see how this is to work together
[53:04] as it comes down and everybody has a
[53:06] place but you know many times people
[53:09] want to look at it as the scripture
[53:11] tells us you know
[53:13] um you know we're not to be Lords over
[53:15] God's heritage
[53:16] but we're supposed to be caretakers of
[53:19] God's Heritage and so you know when it
[53:21] when you look at God being a husbandman
[53:23] you know then he prunes and he takes
[53:26] care of this and you know he has care of
[53:28] what he's trying to do and and many
[53:30] times people like to try to think you
[53:32] know we're supposed to or even sometimes
[53:35] people has the mentality that the pastor
[53:38] is up here and he's just supposed to
[53:39] beat you over the head or or you know
[53:42] all these type of things and not
[53:43] realizing the strain and the pressure
[53:46] that the preachers go through that the
[53:48] ministers that the pastor goes through
[53:51] trying to labor in the word for the
[53:55] people
[53:56] and the care that it takes that because
[53:59] it's you know like brother Branham says
[54:02] you know many times he would get up and
[54:04] he's been you know he's cutting but you
[54:06] know it's not because he wants to be
[54:08] that way brother random strike but he's
[54:10] trying to convey the word of God and
[54:12] even sometimes you know he says you know
[54:14] I tried to pass you know try to pass
[54:16] around this sometimes but he said God
[54:18] kept bringing me back to this
[54:20] why because he was the voice to tell the
[54:23] people that you're veering off that
[54:25] you're off the word that you're not in
[54:27] the place that you're you should be and
[54:29] he's bringing the people back to show
[54:31] them where they ought to be
[54:34] and so he was trying to bring the people
[54:36] back to this place and here here brother
[54:39] Madam speaking of God being this good
[54:42] husbandman
[54:43] and he wants us to bring forth good
[54:45] fruit
[54:46] he wants us to bring forth more fruit
[54:50] and then he continues the parts for us
[54:52] to bring forth much fruit the scripture
[54:54] tells us so as we come through these
[54:56] things and he said the things that are
[54:57] not to be correct that he said he's
[54:59] there to prune all these things off
[55:02] so that we may grow back grow more to
[55:04] become more into the stature of him he
[55:07] said that we cut all these things off
[55:10] for uh for us to see how these things
[55:12] take place here is trimming all these
[55:14] things off
[55:17] and so when these things are taking
[55:18] place it's to it's to make us more into
[55:21] his image
[55:23] and many times we go through many things
[55:25] in our lives and we wonder why we don't
[55:28] understand or we we don't appreciate
[55:30] those things that that we have to go
[55:32] through the things that we have to face
[55:33] but you know we see these things are for
[55:36] our benefit they have a a great uh
[55:39] benefit to us the Heavenly uh Vision
[55:42] that's taking place of when God brings
[55:44] us all through these things how he
[55:47] brings us all through these
[55:50] and so he continues on here in in
[55:54] Hebrews chapter 2.
[55:57] brother Brian was speaking and he and he
[55:59] begins to talk about
[56:01] Redemption
[56:03] he says I wish we had more time right
[56:05] now he said I'd like to take you to that
[56:07] law of redemption he said but we haven't
[56:10] just but just for a moment he said a
[56:12] beautiful picture is in Ruth and Naomi
[56:15] he said if you'll see there the
[56:17] reconciliation how that the husbandman
[56:20] the man that was to redeem The Lost and
[56:24] the Fallen estate had to begin folks to
[56:26] the person that had lost the estate he
[56:30] said that's the reason Boaz had to be a
[56:32] Kinsman to Naomi that he could get Ruth
[56:35] then he had to be worthy and he talks
[56:38] about having to go through and make a
[56:40] testimony and to redeem them
[56:42] and this is from the breach
[56:47] brother Brown says see Boaz had to
[56:49] become a redeemer and he was the only
[56:51] one that could he had to be a Kinsman a
[56:54] near Kinsman and redeeming Naomi he got
[56:57] Ruth that was Jesus Boaz type in Christ
[57:00] and when he redeemed Israel he got the
[57:03] Gentile bride
[57:04] so here here he is when he's talking
[57:06] about this reconciliation see they you
[57:10] know as as the scripture tells us and
[57:12] brother Brian tells us you know he
[57:14] didn't God didn't bring it Christ didn't
[57:16] bring us to an inheritance he brought us
[57:19] back to an inheritance that inheritance
[57:21] was already ours but there had to be
[57:24] reconciliation to bring us back into
[57:26] into the place where we needed to be
[57:29] because you know because the scripture
[57:31] tells us and brother I'm talking about
[57:33] the broad tree the bride tree was was
[57:36] ate down but there was a word that was
[57:38] given for them to be restored to bring
[57:40] back to cultivate the tree back to the
[57:43] place where it was to bring back the
[57:45] fullness of the tree
[57:47] for us to come back to the fullness of
[57:50] what God had in his mind of what the
[57:52] bride would be
[57:53] see down Through the Ages the bride was
[57:56] was a part of Christ but she never could
[57:58] she never could manifest the part that
[58:01] God wanted her to express she never
[58:03] could because the word was ate down but
[58:06] the word had to be restored so she could
[58:08] come back to the place where God wanted
[58:10] her to be
[58:11] and so there was a Reconciliation a word
[58:13] of reconciliation that had to come that
[58:16] she could be brought back to the place
[58:18] where she ought to be
[58:20] just just as Naomi and and Ruth there
[58:23] you know you know when Naomi had lost
[58:26] her family and she had went away but
[58:28] when she came back there had to be
[58:31] somebody there that was willing to
[58:33] redeem Naomi to bring her back into her
[58:36] possessions
[58:38] because you know what because the
[58:40] possession still belonged to Naomi those
[58:43] were still her possessions but the
[58:46] problem was there had to be somebody to
[58:48] do the work to do the act of
[58:50] reconciliation as a Kinsmen to do the
[58:53] work to bring her back to that place and
[58:56] when that when so when Boaz come to a
[58:58] place you know realizing he couldn't do
[59:00] the work
[59:01] when there was a near Kinsman who
[59:03] wouldn't do it
[59:05] he didn't want to do it but Boaz wanted
[59:07] to
[59:09] and he came and he done that and he done
[59:11] the work to bring Naomi back to the
[59:13] place where she ought to be
[59:14] bring what was hers back to us she came
[59:17] back in to possession of what actually
[59:19] belonged to her
[59:21] and so then then you know that he was
[59:23] able to get to get Ruth but see there
[59:25] was the one that had to bring us back to
[59:27] the place where we ought to be to bring
[59:29] us back into fullness of where we ought
[59:32] to be
[59:34] praise God because you know when you
[59:37] think of where you came from and where
[59:39] he came from to bring us back into
[59:42] because praise God when we come in this
[59:44] world lost and alienated from God and
[59:47] not who thought we had anything but
[59:49] praise God the word come to reckon to
[59:52] show us who we are and what belonged to
[59:54] us
[59:56] we're not second-class Citizens We're
[59:59] Not aliens but you know what we are
[1:00:00] children of the Living God and he came
[1:00:03] to bring us back into fellowship and
[1:00:05] bring us back into possession of what is
[1:00:07] ours
[1:00:09] did he come to bring us back to restore
[1:00:12] us
[1:00:17] see it's a wonderful thing to realize
[1:00:19] who you are
[1:00:22] I you know because many times the devil
[1:00:25] wants us to live so far below our
[1:00:26] Privileges and not realize Who We Are
[1:00:29] and take God at his word
[1:00:36] right but that's what God wants us to do
[1:00:38] he wants us to
[1:00:41] take a
[1:00:43] take a stand and realize what belongs to
[1:00:45] us
[1:00:47] hey stand up
[1:00:51] because if he's done he's done the work
[1:00:54] a Reconciliation
[1:00:57] if he's if he's paid the price if he's
[1:01:00] done if he's done the work and he's
[1:01:02] brought it back to you
[1:01:04] can you imagine that if if here here's
[1:01:07] Naomi who's been alienated and she she
[1:01:11] lost everything
[1:01:13] but it still belonged to her
[1:01:16] but then all of a sudden here's Boaz
[1:01:18] comes out and does the work of
[1:01:20] reconciliation of restoration and brings
[1:01:23] her back to the place and says listen
[1:01:25] Naomi all the things that you've lost
[1:01:27] belong to you again they're now in your
[1:01:30] possession and then Naomi's still living
[1:01:33] on the side of the road somewhere
[1:01:37] what if she was living in some in some
[1:01:39] Squall or somewhere and not realizing
[1:01:41] she had a place to go to she had a
[1:01:44] possession and yet she never took
[1:01:46] possession of it
[1:01:49] she had something that she could went on
[1:01:51] and then she had all of these goods and
[1:01:54] she had this land and all these other
[1:01:55] things that belonged to her and yet she
[1:01:57] never walked in it she never took
[1:01:59] possession of it she never claimed any
[1:02:01] of it well then what was the what was
[1:02:04] the work that Boaz done if you never
[1:02:06] take and possess the things that Boaz
[1:02:08] has given you
[1:02:10] if the work has been done and you never
[1:02:12] claim those things
[1:02:14] if he's brought it back to you and you
[1:02:17] and made you heir
[1:02:20] hey you're you're the heir of these
[1:02:22] things
[1:02:23] all the promises of God that are in the
[1:02:26] scripture they become ours but you know
[1:02:28] what if we don't take possession of them
[1:02:30] if we don't claim them then you know
[1:02:31] what what God has done is null and void
[1:02:36] but if we take these things and while
[1:02:38] and realize what God has brought back to
[1:02:40] us what God has given us
[1:02:43] and then we take these things and then
[1:02:45] we'll begin to walk in those things
[1:02:48] just just as the word of God has been
[1:02:50] planted in each one of us
[1:02:53] then guess what then God the holy spirit
[1:02:55] is here
[1:02:56] to grow for you to Quicken the word that
[1:02:59] you hold
[1:03:01] for you to grow by
[1:03:07] then if then if we if we lack something
[1:03:10] as as second Peter tells us about you
[1:03:13] know and we realize you know if we if we
[1:03:15] have these things that we're not Barren
[1:03:18] or unfruitful
[1:03:19] but you know we can grow by these things
[1:03:23] we have these are our possessions
[1:03:26] that we're able to grow
[1:03:29] then when when he's given when he's
[1:03:31] giving you the word and he and he brings
[1:03:33] the Holy Spirit which is to Quicken the
[1:03:35] word which is to water the word when he
[1:03:38] brings these things to you then when
[1:03:40] when he brings these things to you then
[1:03:42] if you don't grow then what's that whose
[1:03:45] problem is it
[1:03:47] so he's trying to cultivate why because
[1:03:49] he's a husbandman and what what does a
[1:03:52] husband been doing he is there working
[1:03:54] on that Bri on that tree and that he's
[1:03:57] beginning to cultivate and everything
[1:03:59] that you have need of he begins to work
[1:04:01] in your life everybody's different but
[1:04:03] whatever you have need if you start on
[1:04:05] this journey and he begins to lead you
[1:04:07] along that journey and he begins to
[1:04:09] bring out the things that you have on
[1:04:11] the inside that you bring forth the
[1:04:13] things that God has given you that you
[1:04:15] begin to manifest Jesus Christ
[1:04:18] why because everybody has a different
[1:04:20] thing that they've got to overcome but
[1:04:22] praise God whatever it is that you're
[1:04:24] old that you've got to overcome greater
[1:04:27] is he that's in you than he that's in
[1:04:29] the world he's already given you these
[1:04:31] things to overcome by these things if
[1:04:33] you will just continue to feed on these
[1:04:35] things and grow by them
[1:04:37] but say to praise God when you realize
[1:04:39] you know he doesn't just plant something
[1:04:41] and as brother Wade was talking about
[1:04:43] the baby you know we just go stick it in
[1:04:45] the calls and expect it to grow up
[1:04:48] but you know it's the same thing about
[1:04:50] having a husbandman that's cultivating a
[1:04:54] a seed which is the word of God that
[1:04:56] when he is trying to grow this they say
[1:04:58] he's overseeing that word because that
[1:05:00] word is going to come to fruition
[1:05:03] whether you believe that or not he will
[1:05:07] why because God started a work in you
[1:05:11] how many how many times has God done
[1:05:13] something in your life and you begin to
[1:05:15] look at the things that you went through
[1:05:16] in your life and you don't think you'll
[1:05:18] overcome when you don't think you'll
[1:05:20] make it when you don't think you'll get
[1:05:22] an answer when you don't see a miracle
[1:05:24] and all of a sudden when you begin the
[1:05:26] word comes forth and he begins to speak
[1:05:28] to you in the middle of the night or
[1:05:30] from a preacher or wherever it is he
[1:05:32] begins to speak to you and all of a
[1:05:34] sudden you begin to see that your answer
[1:05:35] is already there and all of a sudden you
[1:05:37] begin to say the things that God starts
[1:05:39] working in your life even when you can't
[1:05:41] put it in your mind to understand what
[1:05:43] God's going to do he'll come on the
[1:05:44] scene and begin to work
[1:05:48] how many people can stay I mean how many
[1:05:50] times how many people can hear can stand
[1:05:52] up and say you know what I believed
[1:05:54] everything God said I expected all this
[1:05:56] to take place
[1:05:59] how many times have you heard things
[1:06:01] happen in your life and you're trying
[1:06:03] you're still trying to wrap your mind
[1:06:04] around it when you sit down and you
[1:06:06] think about the goodness of God and you
[1:06:08] begin to think about what God's done in
[1:06:09] your life and where you've come from and
[1:06:11] where you are today and still try to
[1:06:13] wrap your human mind your finite mind
[1:06:15] around what God's done for you
[1:06:18] to realize what God's done for you
[1:06:21] where you are today
[1:06:29] How Great Is Our God that he's brought
[1:06:31] us to this place
[1:06:37] see if we can if we realize what God has
[1:06:39] done for us
[1:06:41] God has done so many wonderful things in
[1:06:44] our life
[1:06:48] see if we begin to just take the things
[1:06:50] that God has said
[1:06:52] and see the works that God has done
[1:06:57] and see God God has already fulfilled
[1:06:59] these things
[1:07:04] we don't see that
[1:07:07] we can't even you know but that's what
[1:07:09] the scripture tells us
[1:07:13] in the mind of God it's already finished
[1:07:17] when he died on the cross he took
[1:07:20] stripes on his back and died on the
[1:07:21] cross and said it's finished
[1:07:23] when he said it was finished then you
[1:07:25] know what brother Bradham said if if
[1:07:27] Jesus was standing here right now in a
[1:07:31] suit in front of you he couldn't do any
[1:07:33] more than what he's already done for you
[1:07:36] you come and said Jesus heal me he said
[1:07:38] I can't he said I've already done it
[1:07:42] I've already healed you you are you've
[1:07:44] already come to that place
[1:07:48] now who's now who's who because he's
[1:07:50] already brought you the gift
[1:07:55] when you when you're seeking the Holy
[1:07:58] Ghost and you're out praying that the
[1:07:59] Lord coming you know one of these one of
[1:08:01] these days you know what you realize you
[1:08:03] know what that God begins to speak to
[1:08:05] you and you realize from the scripture
[1:08:06] that you know what it's already been
[1:08:08] given to you
[1:08:11] it's already a gift he's already given
[1:08:13] to you
[1:08:15] and one of these days we realize we
[1:08:17] realize if we die out to ourselves and
[1:08:19] we can receive it but the problem is is
[1:08:21] we want to hold on to Aaron Roberts
[1:08:24] we're still holding on to Bob black
[1:08:29] and in one of these days you know what
[1:08:30] we die out to ourselves
[1:08:32] well we get out of it we get out of our
[1:08:34] own way then God can do something
[1:08:37] and all of a sudden we realize you know
[1:08:39] I've got out of my way I got out of
[1:08:41] God's way
[1:08:45] and then we get to that place well
[1:08:46] praise God then God can do something God
[1:08:48] can show us what he's already given us
[1:08:54] my brother Brandon stood there and said
[1:08:56] he said do you realize that God wants to
[1:08:59] give you the Holy Ghost more than you
[1:09:01] wanted yourself
[1:09:03] you know how many times how many times
[1:09:04] do we stand there and we and we we were
[1:09:07] you know because we're we're we are so
[1:09:09] worked up about receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:09:11] we're so desirous and not realizing God
[1:09:13] wants to give it to us more than we
[1:09:15] wanted ourselves
[1:09:20] see it's a it's an amazing thing when we
[1:09:22] realize that why because God wants to
[1:09:24] give it to you
[1:09:26] and there comes a day when you realize
[1:09:29] that you that the Lord is coming to
[1:09:31] bring that to you there's a day that
[1:09:34] he's coming in to dwell in you
[1:09:38] we're we die out to ourselves
[1:09:41] and we can receive him but it takes a
[1:09:43] dying out to ourselves
[1:09:45] God honors our faith
[1:09:48] and he said he gives us the Holy Ghost
[1:09:51] there's a time we realize you know
[1:09:52] because we got faith in what he's doing
[1:09:56] we get out our we get out of our way we
[1:09:58] get out of his way
[1:10:02] see we understand these things that we
[1:10:04] God can bless us
[1:10:07] and everything else it's the same
[1:10:09] because it's the same one that led us on
[1:10:11] that started on our journey that found
[1:10:13] us wherever we were and some in in our
[1:10:17] confusion and our darkness and put us
[1:10:19] into a place that he brought us into the
[1:10:21] light
[1:10:22] and Justified us and Sanctified us and
[1:10:25] fill us with a holy ghost brought us all
[1:10:28] the way through
[1:10:29] and then all of a sudden we get to the
[1:10:30] place where we realize you know what we
[1:10:32] we have feel been filled with the Holy
[1:10:34] Ghost and been brought into the kingdom
[1:10:35] of Jesus Christ and we realize that
[1:10:38] we've come into the kingdom of God and
[1:10:40] we have a place we have standing with
[1:10:43] him when we see we understand who these
[1:10:45] things are and then then people will
[1:10:48] turn around and and what well I don't
[1:10:50] know if I can make it up the statue of a
[1:10:51] perfect man
[1:10:53] am I going to am I going to well because
[1:10:55] it's the same Journey it's the same
[1:10:58] Faith it's the same word that started
[1:11:00] you started on the journey with it's
[1:11:02] going to continue on the way
[1:11:09] see it's the same it's the same Journey
[1:11:16] Lord just help us get out of our way
[1:11:20] help us get out of your way
[1:11:24] see what what takes place what what do
[1:11:27] we what do we need because
[1:11:29] when we began to look here and and we
[1:11:31] talk about God being the husbandman and
[1:11:33] and Christ meant and we we see how
[1:11:36] Christ was the husbandman and you're
[1:11:38] realizing in the last day what that's
[1:11:40] the reason I read this scripture I'm I'm
[1:11:42] gonna I'm gonna close here in a minute
[1:11:44] but that's the reason why I read that
[1:11:46] scripture tonight
[1:11:48] Ephesians 4. why why did he why did he
[1:11:52] sin Apostles or prophets evangelists
[1:11:55] Pete teachers and pastors why were they
[1:11:57] sent
[1:12:01] why were they sent because they were
[1:12:04] sent to bring us to the place where we
[1:12:06] ought to come to
[1:12:10] he says Hey here in the scripture I want
[1:12:13] to read this he said for the perfecting
[1:12:15] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:12:17] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:12:19] Christ
[1:12:20] he said till we all come in the unity of
[1:12:23] the faith
[1:12:26] what we all have to be born again by the
[1:12:28] same faith we brought or brought into
[1:12:30] the body and of the knowledge of the Son
[1:12:32] of God unto a perfect man unto the
[1:12:35] measure of the stature the fullness of
[1:12:37] Christ
[1:12:38] so we all come to the place where God
[1:12:41] because every one of us has a place in
[1:12:44] the body of Christ everybody has their
[1:12:47] position in the body of Christ
[1:12:50] amen you know because sometimes people
[1:12:52] don't realize you know you've got a
[1:12:54] position you've got a place in the body
[1:12:56] of Christ you're part of the body and
[1:12:58] you know what you're important
[1:13:01] because you know what it don't it don't
[1:13:03] matter who it is or what important part
[1:13:05] of the body it is you're important
[1:13:07] because without you whether you think
[1:13:10] you're so insignificant and yet nobody
[1:13:12] will miss you but if you're part of the
[1:13:14] body of Christ you're significant
[1:13:16] because without you the body is not
[1:13:19] complete
[1:13:20] whether no matter whether you think how
[1:13:22] small or insignificant but you know what
[1:13:24] even though even the the parts of the
[1:13:26] body the scripture tells us you know
[1:13:28] what all the small parts even the
[1:13:30] uncommonly parts you know what they
[1:13:31] still have their comeliness they have
[1:13:33] their part and they have their position
[1:13:35] and they have their respect and their
[1:13:38] honor
[1:13:39] everybody everything has their position
[1:13:41] has their place
[1:13:46] and so as he was speaking What it Took
[1:13:50] the fivefold ministry the husbandman
[1:13:55] because there's no longer it's no longer
[1:13:57] I
[1:13:58] it's it's it's not me doing the work
[1:14:02] because I I honestly I would tell you
[1:14:05] I'm I'm I I'm a poor example of the of a
[1:14:09] minister
[1:14:12] well I didn't get any amen so that's
[1:14:13] good
[1:14:15] but that's the way you know because you
[1:14:17] know what you can't think any higher
[1:14:18] than you
[1:14:22] then you have to realize you know who
[1:14:24] you are
[1:14:25] I realize who I am I wake up with this
[1:14:28] guy every day
[1:14:29] I look at him in the mirror every day
[1:14:34] but you know what it wasn't for the
[1:14:35] grace of God you know what we we
[1:14:37] wouldn't be where we are today
[1:14:40] it's not because I realize my faults and
[1:14:43] failures nobody has to point them out I
[1:14:45] see them all the time
[1:14:47] I live with me
[1:14:51] I know who I am
[1:14:54] but praise God see it's it's not me
[1:14:57] because I you know
[1:15:00] I I you know I think man we've got some
[1:15:02] great ministers here
[1:15:09] and I I listen to them and I'm like man
[1:15:14] we got I mean
[1:15:17] it's like well I'll just take a back
[1:15:18] seat
[1:15:25] when you see those things but you
[1:15:26] realize God called you to do your part
[1:15:31] you can't you because you know we look
[1:15:34] if we look at ourselves we're
[1:15:35] insignificant
[1:15:37] we're inadequate
[1:15:39] but praise God it's not us it's God
[1:15:43] it's God doing the work
[1:15:47] but see it takes God and and so brother
[1:15:49] I'm talking about the the preachers the
[1:15:52] preachers and the pastors so the
[1:15:54] fivefold ministry is the husband and
[1:15:56] what are they trying to do they're
[1:15:57] trying to cultivate the word that people
[1:16:00] hold who you are they're trying to con
[1:16:02] cultivate that word they're trying to
[1:16:05] cultivate Jesus Christ in you
[1:16:08] and many times people say well you know
[1:16:10] that's just that's just brother Dale or
[1:16:13] that's just brother Wade or that's just
[1:16:15] brother Bob well you know sometimes we
[1:16:16] got to stop and think you know what we
[1:16:18] just need to say no we just need to be
[1:16:20] quiet
[1:16:23] because sometimes we don't realize
[1:16:24] sometimes because what is hindering us
[1:16:27] is our own thoughts and it's our own
[1:16:30] it's our own actions it's our own mouth
[1:16:31] we're we're hindering God
[1:16:35] because you're gonna say well you know
[1:16:37] maybe maybe somebody says something that
[1:16:39] we don't like something something is
[1:16:41] said that we thought that we take
[1:16:42] offense to
[1:16:45] it's like well you know what
[1:16:47] before you say anything or before you
[1:16:49] act a different way maybe what you need
[1:16:51] to do is pray about it
[1:16:54] we need to sit down and pray about it
[1:16:56] and say well Lord
[1:16:57] I don't want I don't want to be a
[1:16:59] hindrance
[1:17:01] because you know what as a body
[1:17:05] maybe I don't you know because you know
[1:17:07] we look at what brother Brandon said
[1:17:08] about hindering the church you know one
[1:17:10] person can can have a problem say You
[1:17:13] Hinder yourself but You Hinder everybody
[1:17:14] else
[1:17:18] when you when you overcome when you're
[1:17:20] strong when you uh when you do your part
[1:17:24] then you know what you're edifying the
[1:17:25] body
[1:17:28] but you know what when we fail when we
[1:17:31] don't do our part
[1:17:36] how small or insignificant we think but
[1:17:39] he was saying you know one little thing
[1:17:41] one person can do one thing and cause a
[1:17:44] church to fail
[1:17:46] we can hinder somebody from getting
[1:17:48] their healing
[1:17:50] we can hinder so many people and not
[1:17:52] realize it
[1:17:55] what was it when Aiken was out there in
[1:17:58] the in the in the in the battle
[1:18:02] well he saw just a few wedges of gold in
[1:18:05] a garment that Babylonian garment
[1:18:09] well it was just insignificant it was
[1:18:11] small nobody was ever going to miss any
[1:18:13] of that
[1:18:15] nobody was ever going to miss those
[1:18:17] those gold wedges and that garment
[1:18:20] look at all the stuff that was left no
[1:18:23] none of that was touched all that got
[1:18:25] destroyed we didn't mess with any of
[1:18:26] that
[1:18:28] had that one little bit
[1:18:32] and what was it just just that one
[1:18:34] little bit and how many men died
[1:18:38] was it 21
[1:18:42] brother Bob will tell me
[1:18:45] but Bob's going I don't know
[1:18:49] but you know how many men lost their
[1:18:50] lives because they thought well that's
[1:18:52] insignificant
[1:18:58] and if we think well I'm part of this
[1:19:00] body
[1:19:02] and it's like well I don't do my part
[1:19:06] then you know you can hinder somebody
[1:19:08] else
[1:19:11] and sometimes the issues that we have
[1:19:15] is some people get in their mind
[1:19:18] a certain person
[1:19:21] is invaluable
[1:19:25] one person is expendable
[1:19:29] one person
[1:19:32] we can overlook
[1:19:35] and not realizing God doesn't look at
[1:19:37] them that way
[1:19:40] some of the some of the ones that are
[1:19:42] not here with us anymore
[1:19:45] and I'm not talking about the ones that
[1:19:46] have passed on I'm talking about the
[1:19:48] ones that are not in this building
[1:19:53] the one person I think of
[1:19:56] is Brother George
[1:20:01] you know when you think about people
[1:20:02] that are not here
[1:20:06] well you know what they have their value
[1:20:08] because God loves them
[1:20:10] God died for them
[1:20:14] and many times like well they're
[1:20:16] insignificant or whatever no
[1:20:18] they're not
[1:20:22] one person
[1:20:23] one young person that's left this church
[1:20:28] when you look at one child that's walked
[1:20:31] out of this church
[1:20:33] no matter what they do when they walk
[1:20:36] out of this church they're walking over
[1:20:37] a lot of prayers when they walked out
[1:20:39] that door
[1:20:40] and you know what each one of those
[1:20:42] children
[1:20:44] are worth ten thousand worlds
[1:20:49] all the money that Bill Gates and
[1:20:53] all of them ever all the money that
[1:20:57] Toyota has
[1:21:01] none of that means anything
[1:21:04] to One Soul
[1:21:09] they walk out this door they well you
[1:21:11] know I'm living my life I'm I'm living
[1:21:14] it up I'm doing good no you're not
[1:21:20] and I don't care where you go or what
[1:21:22] you do you walk out of this church
[1:21:25] the the token is still being applied to
[1:21:27] you and I don't care if nobody else
[1:21:29] prays for them I'll pray for them
[1:21:35] stand
[1:21:37] and belief for them
[1:21:41] because I believe God will because if I
[1:21:44] believe that God has called them and we
[1:21:46] have called for them and they'll come
[1:21:48] back
[1:21:49] man and I you know
[1:21:52] I ain't got to try to figure it out
[1:21:56] I know he'll take care of it
[1:22:00] so
[1:22:02] we have we have our job to do
[1:22:06] and
[1:22:07] we are to be
[1:22:09] ones that
[1:22:13] not to not to be as the scripture says
[1:22:16] not to be a lord
[1:22:19] over the people
[1:22:22] but to be a servant
[1:22:25] and I got a couple of scriptures here I
[1:22:28] want to read before I before I quit
[1:22:29] first Peter 5 1-5 says the elders which
[1:22:34] are among you I exhort who am also an
[1:22:37] elder and a witness of the sufferings of
[1:22:39] Christ and also a part A partaker of the
[1:22:42] glory that shall be revealed feeding
[1:22:44] feed the flock of God which is among you
[1:22:46] being the oversight thereof not by
[1:22:50] constraint
[1:22:52] but being but willingly
[1:22:55] not for filthy Luke or but of a ready
[1:22:57] mind neither as being Lords over God's
[1:23:00] Heritage but being examples to the flock
[1:23:05] and when the chief Shepherd shall appear
[1:23:07] you shall receive a Crown of Glory that
[1:23:09] faith not away likewise ye younger
[1:23:12] submit yourselves unto the Elder yea all
[1:23:15] of you be subject one to another and be
[1:23:16] clothed with humility for God resisteth
[1:23:19] the proud and giveth grace to the humble
[1:23:24] and so that is that is our job
[1:23:27] and I appreciate the brothers here I
[1:23:29] appreciate brother Wade
[1:23:30] and his work
[1:23:32] and his labor
[1:23:35] and these other brothers
[1:23:37] I appreciate their
[1:23:41] and I I hope and pray that I get to the
[1:23:46] place where I'm willing an example of
[1:23:50] your ministry
[1:23:57] because we realize is God doing the work
[1:23:59] it's not us
[1:24:01] but God has placed these men in our
[1:24:03] lives to bring us to the place that we
[1:24:05] need to come to
[1:24:08] in the last scripture I want to read
[1:24:10] here tonight
[1:24:12] this is from First Corinthians chapter 3
[1:24:15] by 5-8
[1:24:17] and it says who then is Paul and who is
[1:24:19] Apollos but ministers by whom we
[1:24:23] believed even as the lord gave to every
[1:24:25] man
[1:24:26] he says I've planted Apollos watered but
[1:24:29] God gave the increase
[1:24:31] so then neither is he that planteth
[1:24:33] anything neither he that watereth but
[1:24:36] God that giveth the increase now he that
[1:24:39] planteth and he that watereth are one
[1:24:41] and every man shall receive his own
[1:24:43] reward according to his own labor
[1:24:46] so we all have our own part to do
[1:24:50] and as
[1:24:52] we see
[1:24:54] God has called us to this place and we
[1:24:57] are to help cultivate
[1:25:01] the body
[1:25:03] and each one of us have our own part to
[1:25:05] play but you know God called us to this
[1:25:08] place and if God has called us to be
[1:25:11] ministers to cultivate this
[1:25:15] he said you know Paul said I planted
[1:25:17] Apollos water but God gave the increase
[1:25:21] whatever one does and the other one
[1:25:23] comes behind it all five officers have
[1:25:26] to work together
[1:25:29] all five fold the five-fold ministry has
[1:25:32] to work together
[1:25:33] there's not one greater than the other
[1:25:35] it's all of us working together because
[1:25:36] God is the one that gives the increase
[1:25:40] the prophet came and brought us the word
[1:25:44] but he gave a Divine Commission
[1:25:47] for the ministers to pick this message
[1:25:49] up and to carry it on he said that there
[1:25:51] will be young men that will pick this
[1:25:53] message up and sweep it on to the coming
[1:25:55] of the Lord
[1:25:56] and I believe that if I believe that's
[1:25:59] what God has called us to
[1:26:01] but not not to be uh not to be someone
[1:26:05] that tries to be a lord over anybody or
[1:26:07] try to try to force people into
[1:26:10] something
[1:26:12] but to be an example
[1:26:14] to the Believers of what needs to take
[1:26:17] place
[1:26:18] amen well God bless you tonight let's
[1:26:21] all stand we'll have the musicians
[1:26:22] coming
