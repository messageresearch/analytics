[0:00] of all the avenues and parks and where
[0:02] the throne's gonna be and where that the
[0:05] land will be the light we won't need
[0:07] light in the city it'll always be
[0:09] bright
[0:10] but as long as we get there that's what
[0:12] we need to deal with is how to get there
[0:15] man and all the other things will come
[0:17] together it will be built by your desire
[0:21] uh i don't see how that um me and lisa's
[0:23] gonna live together though because she's
[0:25] gonna have a sandy beach and i'm gonna
[0:26] have a mountain so i don't know how in
[0:28] the world that's gonna
[0:29] that's gonna get together but maybe we
[0:31] will i mean that's
[0:33] a lot you know that's what we'll be i
[0:34] mean if you love mountains you'll have
[0:36] mountains if you love sandy beaches
[0:38] you'll have sandy beaches so
[0:42] we'll let god work that out for us is
[0:43] that okay
[0:45] and he already has so don't worry about
[0:47] it he knew we would like beaches he knew
[0:48] we would like sand and some other like
[0:50] sand and some would like a good cool
[0:52] mountain stream so
[0:54] that was uh
[0:55] all part of the plan from the foundation
[0:57] of the world he already had it figured
[0:58] out all the way up all the way from when
[1:00] he said let there be
[1:02] when he said when he said let us make
[1:04] man in our image he began to build the
[1:06] city right there
[1:08] and that city's been built and developed
[1:10] in his mind all the way until it's going
[1:12] to be a reality just like you were in
[1:14] the mind of god before the foundation of
[1:16] the world
[1:16] you were already signed sealed delivered
[1:19] born again
[1:20] already made it but it was because of
[1:22] foreknowledge that he saw what you'd do
[1:24] when you got down here amen so to me
[1:27] that's very simple but people get it all
[1:29] messed up saying that we came here with
[1:31] all this eternal
[1:33] no i don't think so but anyway it's not
[1:35] bible the bible said we were lost
[1:38] okay we were lost we needed a savior we
[1:41] didn't need a savior then we didn't need
[1:42] jesus to come if we were just always
[1:44] this little eternal person
[1:46] then um we just got to make sure we get
[1:48] our quotes right
[1:49] and we get the holy ghost filter on top
[1:52] of those quotes to make sure that we
[1:54] know what god's saying
[1:56] to us because we can make the prophet of
[1:58] god we make the bible listen the bible
[2:00] is being preached today in thousands of
[2:02] other churches thousands of different
[2:04] ways
[2:05] same bible
[2:07] it doesn't matter if it's king james
[2:08] version away it's the same principle of
[2:10] the bible that it's being taught several
[2:12] thousand different ways so we can see
[2:14] that
[2:15] that even in the message that they teach
[2:17] the message several thousand ways but
[2:19] they've got to be one way one truth one
[2:21] life there's gotta be everything's gotta
[2:23] fit together nothing is out of cater god
[2:26] didn't send a prophet to be wrong
[2:29] okay
[2:31] now and he didn't send the bible to be
[2:33] wrong okay he sent his word for us to
[2:36] depend on it
[2:37] and that's what we depend on so let's go
[2:39] to hebrews we'll read a couple of
[2:40] scriptures and then we'll start right
[2:42] with the millennium and talk about
[2:44] what's going to happen during the
[2:45] millennium and then the battle of gog
[2:48] and magog and then we'll go to the white
[2:49] throne judgment
[2:51] all right so let's bow our heads
[2:52] heavenly father thank you for this day
[2:53] that you give us
[2:55] we pray now that you sanctify us for
[2:56] this journey that we're in lord thank
[2:58] you for the brothers and sisters that
[3:00] you've placed in front of us today lord
[3:02] be in the cream of the crop of this
[3:04] whole world lord we wouldn't want to be
[3:05] anywhere else but right here lord it's
[3:07] talking about you
[3:08] to a group of people that understands
[3:10] that they're the chosen
[3:12] lord they're the elect lady
[3:14] they're the bride of jesus christ but
[3:17] as the
[3:18] story was today about the armored meat
[3:20] packing
[3:21] little girl she had to accept that
[3:24] she had to accept the invitation to be
[3:26] married and lord one day thank you that
[3:29] you made that invitation to each one of
[3:31] us and we accept it and lord if there be
[3:33] one among us that has not accepted that
[3:34] invitation we pray lord that you would
[3:36] extend that invitation today father
[3:39] also we pray that you extend the
[3:41] invitation lord to be healed
[3:43] and lord to get out of all this stuff
[3:45] that we're in lord
[3:46] and that we went through it it's just
[3:48] part of our journey it's something to
[3:50] make us stronger lord i cannot believe
[3:52] that you'd make your children weaker by
[3:54] it i believe you made them stronger
[3:56] you've made us to where we can think
[3:58] clear you've made us to where we can see
[4:00] things maybe in a different light
[4:02] and lord it's all done for your honor
[4:04] and glory but it is for us lord we pray
[4:07] that you'll be with each one that's not
[4:08] here lord be with the ones that are on
[4:09] vacation or traveling
[4:11] the ones that are sick lord we need we
[4:13] ask you just bring them all together
[4:14] lord and you father forgive us of our
[4:16] sins and bless this day in jesus name
[4:19] amen
[4:21] but christ being coming high priests are
[4:22] good things to come by a greater and
[4:24] more perfect tabernacle not made with
[4:26] hands that is to say
[4:27] not of this building
[4:29] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[4:31] but by his own blood he entered in once
[4:33] into the holy place having obtained
[4:35] eternal redemption
[4:37] for us and let's read isaiah 65 17
[4:41] for behold i create new heavens and a
[4:44] new earth and the former shall not be
[4:46] remembered
[4:47] nor
[4:48] come in
[4:50] to mind and then let's read matthew 25
[4:53] because we're going to talk a little bit
[4:54] about this today this would be the
[4:56] judgment when the son of man shall come
[4:58] in his glory
[5:00] now remember what is the son of man it's
[5:02] god in human flesh who are you and i we
[5:04] are an extension of that we are the son
[5:06] of man the bride of jesus christ the son
[5:09] of man in the end time and it won't just
[5:11] be the end time it carries right on into
[5:13] the to the millennium all right and all
[5:15] the holy angels with him then shall he
[5:17] sit upon the throne of his glory and
[5:19] before him shall be gathered all nations
[5:21] and he shall separate them one from
[5:23] another as a shepherd divideth his sheep
[5:25] now it says as a shepherd
[5:27] it's not like he's the shepherd and he's
[5:29] going to choose the sheep listen we're
[5:31] sheep
[5:32] but it's as the sheep
[5:34] as he divides the sheep
[5:38] from the goats and you may be seated in
[5:39] the lord at his blessing to the reading
[5:41] of the word now we covered this morning
[5:43] we went through
[5:45] many things this morning but we want to
[5:48] just hone in on that now we've we've we
[5:50] took a bite we took a resurrection we
[5:52] took a body change we took a rapture we
[5:55] took a three and a half year
[5:56] uh journey on in the wedding supper and
[5:59] there's been a three and a half year uh
[6:01] preaching of the gospel by two witnesses
[6:03] here on the earth and there's 144 000
[6:05] and two witnesses that are saved and
[6:08] sanctified filled with the holy ghost
[6:10] and they have been killed for what they
[6:11] believe and they're now
[6:14] in a rapture taking a rapture and then
[6:16] god's going to reign fire down on
[6:19] on the
[6:20] earth through the atomic explosion of
[6:23] men man is going to destroy the earth
[6:25] this time okay
[6:26] that's why there's going to think that
[6:28] we talk about things that will be in the
[6:30] millennium that will not be in the
[6:31] future home when god reigns his fire
[6:34] holy fire
[6:36] at the battle of gog and magog when holy
[6:38] fire comes it destroys souls
[6:41] this atomic explosion will not destroy
[6:44] souls it just puts those souls in
[6:46] another place everybody got that say
[6:49] amen
[6:50] amen because that's what's going to
[6:51] happen it's going to put souls in the
[6:53] fifth dimension or wherever god decides
[6:55] to put them at
[6:56] and they have to stay there but it does
[6:58] not kill them
[7:00] and then also there will not be the
[7:02] devil will still be alive
[7:04] and he will still have his little imps
[7:06] and they'll still be alive but they'll
[7:07] have nothing to work through they will
[7:09] be as we're going to read here in just a
[7:11] minute that he will be bound by a chain
[7:13] and the prophet of god told us that was
[7:16] a what chain of circumstances that
[7:18] there's no way he can work
[7:21] in the millennium on a group of people
[7:25] that are born again that are saved
[7:28] sanctified filled with the holy ghost
[7:29] whatever you want to call it i and like
[7:31] i said i the heathen and all these i
[7:33] don't understand about that i'll just
[7:34] tell you i do not
[7:36] but there's a place for everybody
[7:39] and we'll just let god work that out if
[7:41] you don't mind so let's go ahead and if
[7:42] you don't mind go to the
[7:45] where we stopped this morning
[7:47] let's go to where it says millennium uh
[7:49] brother anderson if you'll go down it'll
[7:51] be past quote number two it'll say chart
[7:53] then it says millennium talks about a
[7:55] thousand years is one day you're gonna
[7:56] be about four pages
[7:59] and that way will not take up too much
[8:01] time i i don't uh
[8:04] i'm gonna read we've read a lot of
[8:06] scripture we're still gonna read
[8:07] scripture but we're gonna read some
[8:08] quotes because brother brown puts this
[8:10] thing together so well for us
[8:12] but we were talking about this morning
[8:14] there at the end of the service ii peter
[8:16] 3 8 says beloved be not ignorant of this
[8:18] one thing that one day is with the lord
[8:19] as a thousand years and a thousand years
[8:23] as one day and continue on in genesis
[8:28] because like we were talking yesterday
[8:30] brother brown said satan hates genesis
[8:32] and revelations and that genesis was the
[8:35] c chapter of the bible so everything had
[8:36] its beginning in genesis so we got to go
[8:39] back to genesis to see
[8:41] that they they were told
[8:43] they could eat of the tree of life and
[8:45] live or they could eat of this tree of
[8:47] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
[8:48] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[8:50] eatest thereof thou shalt surely die and
[8:52] we know that satan
[8:55] told eve
[8:56] says thou shalt not surely die
[9:00] he added one word not
[9:02] thou shalt not surely die all right so
[9:05] then that caused all the fall and all
[9:06] the things and the way we have to come
[9:08] now and
[9:10] thorns and thistles and briars and all
[9:12] those things and we were born in sorrow
[9:14] that's what it created but
[9:16] nobody ever lived a thousand years so
[9:19] now methuselah lived 969 years in
[9:21] different ones but there was nobody who
[9:24] lived a thousand years so now what's
[9:25] going to happen in the millennium as the
[9:28] prophet tells us and we read we take the
[9:30] whole of the bible and we take a whole
[9:32] picture of the bible and we see that
[9:34] that's what god was talking about the
[9:35] whole time
[9:37] is that somebody's going to live that
[9:38] thou a millennium there's going to be a
[9:41] time of peace there's going to be time
[9:43] of joy there's going to be a time and
[9:45] it's going to be that thousand years
[9:47] because
[9:49] the scent when the sin curse came on the
[9:51] earth
[9:52] this scripture couldn't be fulfilled
[9:55] for it i mean this scripture will be
[9:57] fulfilled underneath that thousand years
[9:59] but now man was not supposed to die
[10:02] if they ate of the tree of life they
[10:03] were supposed to live
[10:05] and brother brown said their youth was
[10:06] being renewed all the time and
[10:08] everything was hunky-dory and good but
[10:10] when they ate of this other tree
[10:13] now remember that day eve didn't die
[10:16] that day adam didn't die that day
[10:20] but within that thousand years they did
[10:22] die
[10:24] nobody's lived over the thousand years
[10:26] so now in the millennium when we get to
[10:27] the millennium
[10:29] and like i said before remember it's not
[10:31] to the bride i want you to understand
[10:33] that we're going to be there it's going
[10:34] to be a honeymoon we're going to have a
[10:36] good time we're going to have all things
[10:38] common we're we've already went through
[10:40] a body change resurrection rapture went
[10:43] over in another dimension somewhere and
[10:45] was having a good time for several years
[10:47] and then come back into this dimension
[10:49] into the millennium but listen we don't
[10:52] have to prove the sin curse is over
[10:55] we've already proved the sin curse is
[10:57] over listen when you get born again
[11:00] you've potentially destroyed the sin
[11:02] curse
[11:03] i said potentially that's the inside guy
[11:05] the outside guy is still caught
[11:07] underneath that all right
[11:09] but when we get the body changed it will
[11:11] be called out from under that and it
[11:13] won't matter a thousand years ten
[11:15] thousand years or ten million years
[11:18] you and i the bride of jesus christ will
[11:20] destroy the sin curse when those
[11:23] saints come up out of the ground the sin
[11:25] curse will be over for a gentile bride
[11:28] amen because you're going to call a
[11:30] group of people that their physical body
[11:32] has been laying in the earth some of
[11:33] them for 2 000 years
[11:36] and you're going to call them up and
[11:37] they're going to be as fresh as when
[11:38] they were 18 to 20 years old come on
[11:41] people good grief
[11:42] that what are you looking for
[11:45] we come to a place to where it didn't
[11:47] matter the thousand years
[11:49] we're eternal body spirit and soul when
[11:51] that happens
[11:54] but we're changing step over into
[11:56] another dimension
[11:58] it's done for us
[12:00] oh yeah there'll be a a time that we as
[12:02] brother dale was preaching several
[12:04] months ago about there is going to be a
[12:06] time that we're going to have to give an
[12:07] account for what we did do or what we
[12:09] didn't do
[12:10] right but it won't be a it won't be a
[12:12] cause of living a thousand years or
[12:15] getting to the millennium no
[12:17] if you're born again today you already
[12:19] gonna be
[12:21] resurrected
[12:23] physically if you have to
[12:25] you've already changed
[12:27] right potentially
[12:29] you changed the inside guy the inside
[12:31] guy's changed
[12:33] all right
[12:34] the outside guy's waiting on the
[12:36] redemption of the body all right
[12:38] and then we're going to go through a
[12:40] powerful time to where we're going to be
[12:43] able to stand on earth and somebody's
[12:44] going to stay dead come out of the
[12:46] ground and they're going to pull them
[12:47] we're going to pull them into that this
[12:50] dimension we're not going to have to
[12:52] worry about living a thousand years
[12:54] we've just conquered everything
[12:56] and through jesus christ we do it anyway
[12:59] but if you guess what i said if you're
[13:00] born again today you've conquered
[13:01] everything
[13:02] death hell grave
[13:04] uh you listen your soul's never sick
[13:06] your soul if you're born again it's
[13:08] never gonna die has never died
[13:11] never gonna die
[13:13] eternal
[13:16] doesn't need to be
[13:19] babied
[13:21] like this thing's baby it just needs to
[13:23] be what the word give to it as we were
[13:26] talking about this morning it just needs
[13:28] that word to be given to it the statue
[13:30] of a perfect man and all the things that
[13:32] we've been taught all of our life that's
[13:35] what it it feeds on it doesn't feed on
[13:37] anything else
[13:39] your soul doesn't feed on the world
[13:42] if it's born again
[13:43] your soul feeds on the word of god
[13:48] why i said we live a lot of most of time
[13:49] in our spiritual realm because
[13:52] we have earth that we have to deal with
[13:54] all right
[13:55] but remember that soul is a very
[13:57] powerful thing if we'll just let that
[13:59] thing loose
[14:00] and let it do its job all right that's
[14:02] our problem we haven't we haven't been
[14:04] where we can let it loose and let it do
[14:06] its job but it's it's fixing to happen
[14:08] we're fixing the gum to come to a stage
[14:11] to where we're going to either be in the
[14:13] word of god
[14:14] know what god wants and knows we know
[14:17] what god wants to do or we're going to
[14:19] be lost
[14:21] that's just the way it's going to be
[14:22] there's going to be any gray areas
[14:24] there's not going to be any well i
[14:26] didn't hear that and i didn't know that
[14:28] well no
[14:29] you did
[14:30] you may just not listen
[14:33] all right but i'm just saying this when
[14:35] we get to this millennium this then then
[14:37] for sure we can take this part of the
[14:39] millennium and say all right it's not
[14:41] anything to do with the bride
[14:44] it's not anything to do with the
[14:45] gentiles it's not anything to do with
[14:47] giving me eternal life it's not got
[14:49] anything to do with me receiving
[14:51] something
[14:53] all right it's just going to be like and
[14:55] it's it when you get married you get in
[14:57] your car or you get an airplane or you
[15:00] get on a boat and you go on a honeymoon
[15:02] usually it's about a week or ever how
[15:04] long you that you decide to take and
[15:07] it's just you and your wife
[15:09] and you don't send you don't tell her
[15:11] look we're picking beans tomorrow we're
[15:13] getting mad today and we're gonna pick
[15:14] beans tomorrow
[15:16] you wouldn't stay married very long
[15:19] at all
[15:20] remember that some of you that are not
[15:22] married yet
[15:23] don't take your wife on a bean picking
[15:25] tour all right
[15:28] what pamper
[15:31] pamper her
[15:32] that's what god's going to do he's going
[15:34] to pamper us he's going to give us a
[15:36] millennium to all we're going to do is
[15:38] just walk around go wherever we want to
[15:39] go we have no restrictions we have no we
[15:43] we're not even worried about the devil
[15:44] that's being bound by that chain
[15:48] listen he's already been destroyed in us
[15:50] over here
[15:53] he's just trying to gather up to get the
[15:55] other ones
[15:56] right
[15:57] because he know he can't get us when we
[15:58] get in a glorified body because this is
[16:00] the only thing he's got he's got a
[16:02] a dib zone or or something that he can
[16:05] you know claim is this thing right here
[16:08] well when this thing becomes glorified
[16:10] it never was a part of the earth
[16:13] in this condition you understand what i
[16:15] mean it is part of the earth but it's
[16:17] not a part of the earth in the condition
[16:18] that it's going to be changed into all
[16:20] right because there's nothing about you
[16:23] glorified yet except your soul
[16:25] all right but when you get a glorified
[16:27] body and you come into glorified
[16:29] condition you're the same as jesus
[16:30] christ
[16:33] you're the same as jesus christ
[16:35] satan can't touch you
[16:38] but see satan's going to be over here
[16:39] and he knows all these other ones though
[16:41] are still alive
[16:43] he's got all he's even got the
[16:46] come on folks the foolish virgin
[16:48] he's deceived them
[16:51] even though they're virgins he's
[16:52] deceived that group of people also
[16:55] because they're they had to die during
[16:57] the tribulation they had to die
[17:00] and they're laying in the ground
[17:02] somewhere and their soul is in the fifth
[17:04] dimension or wherever you want to say it
[17:06] is and they're waiting to get to the
[17:08] white throne judgment
[17:10] so satan's still got a little bit of
[17:12] part of them that he can play with
[17:13] because the only thing he can't play
[17:15] with is a new birth
[17:18] he can't play with a new birth because
[17:20] he can't get it
[17:21] it ain't for him it's god almighty and
[17:25] satan can't touch that once you get born
[17:27] again
[17:28] all right now he can play in your spirit
[17:29] realm and with your flesh
[17:32] but he cannot bother that soul
[17:35] if you're bothered today you're not born
[17:37] again in your soul if you're bothered by
[17:40] that
[17:41] all right
[17:44] i mean come on we got to get down to to
[17:47] the brass tacks of this thing
[17:49] either you're born again or you're not
[17:50] and then you're going to have to fit
[17:52] into that
[17:54] slot
[17:56] and you're either going to get the
[17:57] blessings
[17:59] are you going to get the cursings
[18:02] no other way around it
[18:04] you can't buy your way out from over
[18:05] this place over to this place all right
[18:08] you got to either be born again or not
[18:10] born again all right so let's all get
[18:12] born again and we won't have to worry
[18:14] about it
[18:15] amen just know that you know that you
[18:17] know that you're born again and and
[18:19] god's working in your life and it
[18:20] doesn't matter come what may it doesn't
[18:22] matter if the bills
[18:24] are coming and you can't pay them that
[18:25] ain't got enough to do with your soul
[18:28] amen
[18:30] your soul is eternal as god is if it's
[18:32] born again today so now let's start with
[18:34] the millennium
[18:36] the isaiah 65 verse 17
[18:41] just scroll it up to the next one
[18:44] for behold i create new heavens and a
[18:45] new earth
[18:47] now what's going to happen
[18:49] the battle of armageddon is going to
[18:50] destroy everything everything's going to
[18:52] die there's going to be an atomic
[18:54] explosion between all of the people in
[18:57] the world the nations are going to fight
[18:58] each other and they're going to
[19:00] virtually kill each other off
[19:02] all right and then god's going to bring
[19:05] that 144 000 or or some jews down here
[19:09] to build that millennial temple
[19:11] okay
[19:12] but now remember that's temporary also
[19:17] it will be destroyed
[19:20] in the next battle
[19:22] when god reigns fire on the earth and i
[19:24] believe he completely cleans and wipes
[19:26] this place off and it all comes up new
[19:29] again amen everybody okay with that
[19:32] so what's going to happen is
[19:35] excuse me i create new heavens and a new
[19:37] earth and the former shall not be
[19:39] remembered
[19:41] nor come into mind but let's be careful
[19:44] and read when we read this and the
[19:46] former shall not be remembered nor come
[19:48] into mind that doesn't mean that your
[19:50] mind is going to be totally blank
[19:53] that doesn't mean you're going to get
[19:54] this new thought
[19:56] that just means the bad things you're
[19:58] not going to be able to remember why
[19:59] would you be in a glorified body and be
[20:00] thinking of bad things
[20:03] the whole deal of this is
[20:05] it's like russ and we were talking
[20:07] listen why do we get these evil thoughts
[20:09] that when we were even evil we didn't
[20:11] get these kind of thoughts
[20:13] amen have you ever not had one
[20:15] if you hadn't be careful it's coming
[20:19] but you have this evil thought that you
[20:20] don't know where in the world that thing
[20:22] come from well it was the old nature
[20:24] that you've had
[20:26] that satan is still out here influencing
[20:29] the world
[20:30] and just like brother branham said that
[20:32] time remember that he told that brother
[20:34] he said
[20:35] you were not supposed to get that
[20:37] thought i was supposed to get that
[20:38] thought
[20:39] remember that's what he said he told the
[20:41] person he said brother brown i have
[20:42] these bad thoughts he said well that
[20:43] wasn't even for you he said that was for
[20:45] me or or something so he said somebody
[20:47] stepped in the way and got that thought
[20:49] well you see that's how the spirit realm
[20:51] works it's working all the time listen
[20:53] the spirit realm is not asleep it's
[20:55] actually more active than we're active
[20:57] today
[20:58] amen because even when you're sleeping
[21:00] in church
[21:01] the spirit world it's working
[21:04] amen okay
[21:09] but be you glad and rejoice forever in
[21:11] that which i i create for behold i
[21:13] create jerusalem rejoicing and are
[21:14] people of joy
[21:16] so it's four
[21:17] look how many times it says jerusalem
[21:19] look how many times it says my people
[21:21] and i will rejoice in jerusalem and join
[21:23] my people and the voice of weeping shall
[21:25] be no more heard in her nor the voice of
[21:27] crying there shall be no more offense an
[21:29] infant of days or an old man that hath
[21:31] not fulfilled his days for the child
[21:33] shall die a hundred years old but the
[21:34] sinner being a hundred years old shall
[21:36] be accursed
[21:37] and they shall build houses
[21:40] and inhabit them and they shall plant
[21:41] vineyards and eat the fruit of them see
[21:43] we've got a thousand years you think you
[21:45] think that's not very long
[21:48] but look at what if you take what we're
[21:51] doing today
[21:52] and go back 1000 years
[21:56] if you take what we're doing today the
[21:58] advancement in technology that we have
[22:00] today and go back a thousand years see
[22:02] how far it's advanced
[22:05] in just a human
[22:07] natural
[22:09] tree of knowledge type of of knowledge
[22:11] that's going what about that we have
[22:14] we have unlimited knowledge as the bride
[22:16] of jesus christ what we can do in that
[22:17] thousand years i believe we're going to
[22:19] have we you know we have creative power
[22:22] i believe we will
[22:23] brother brown said you've got enough in
[22:25] you right now to go create a world and
[22:27] go live on it
[22:30] in you now
[22:32] you can go create a world and go live on
[22:34] it
[22:35] so don't think we'll be just stuck here
[22:37] and we'll be twiddling our thumbs i
[22:38] think we'll be having a happy time
[22:40] amen
[22:41] and they shall build houses and inhabit
[22:43] them and they will plant vineyards and
[22:44] eat the fruit thereof they shall not
[22:46] build in another inhabit they shall not
[22:49] plant and another eat for as the days of
[22:51] a tree are the days of my people
[22:53] and mine elect shall long enjoy the work
[22:55] of their hands that shall not labor in
[22:57] vain now look
[22:59] they must be going to be doing some
[23:01] labor
[23:02] for they shall not labor in vain nor
[23:04] bring forth for trouble for they have
[23:06] the seed of the blessed of the lord and
[23:07] their offspring
[23:09] with them and it shall come to pass that
[23:10] before they call i will answer and while
[23:12] they are yet speaking
[23:14] i will hear
[23:16] like i said before there will be no
[23:18] praying in the millennium
[23:20] what are you going to pray for and pray
[23:22] to
[23:23] the one you need to talk to standing in
[23:25] front of you amen
[23:28] and let me just give you a little point
[23:29] here you say well that's
[23:31] jesus has things he that he's going to
[23:33] fulfill in the millennium right he has
[23:36] to be the son of david he has to sit on
[23:38] the throne ruling the 12 tribes of
[23:40] israel
[23:41] like i said before ruling with a rod of
[23:43] iron and and being the judge and all
[23:45] these different things so he's running a
[23:47] kingdom
[23:48] so you and i though as the bride of
[23:49] jesus christ i believe the people on the
[23:52] earth in the millennium at that time is
[23:53] going to know that we are mrs jesus
[23:56] christ
[23:58] and they'll want to talk to us
[24:00] and they'll want to ask us questions
[24:03] they'll want to get
[24:05] knowledge from me and you
[24:07] knowing that we're that we're not jesus
[24:10] christ but we're a part of jesus christ
[24:12] so much in that we're the same person
[24:16] and we'll have the same thoughts so
[24:19] when i see this and it shall come to
[24:20] pass before they call i will answer now
[24:23] why can't that be for me and you
[24:25] we're not going to just be sitting
[24:26] twiddling our thumbs
[24:28] we're going to be active we're going to
[24:30] be doing things the wolf and the lamb
[24:33] shall feed together
[24:34] because listen you're getting a part of
[24:36] it now when you get a revelation what do
[24:38] you get where are you getting it from
[24:42] where do you get revelation from the
[24:44] devil no
[24:46] you get true revelation from god and
[24:49] it's straight from god it's not in a
[24:51] second person
[24:53] it's god communicating with you
[24:56] personally
[24:58] so what do you think in the millennium
[24:59] that's going to be the same thing when
[25:01] all this look when all this sin barrier
[25:03] and all this all this um adamic nature
[25:06] and all this uh
[25:07] half of me having the mind of christ and
[25:09] the other having the mind of the devil
[25:12] hello
[25:12] somebody but when we get in the
[25:15] millennium
[25:16] it's not gonna be half and half
[25:19] we will have the mind of christ so we'll
[25:21] think exactly like he does we'll be able
[25:24] to answer exactly like adam did when
[25:26] adam named the animals and moved the
[25:29] mountains and moved the trees and god
[25:32] never said no adam you made a mistake
[25:35] he said no that's exactly what i was
[25:37] thinking adam
[25:39] and that's what's going to happen in the
[25:40] millennium so it's not just going to be
[25:42] jesus sitting on a big throne
[25:45] and and then you know people coming up
[25:48] and he's the only one now it's okay he
[25:50] is the son of david he is going to be
[25:52] the one that rules that
[25:53] because he's ruling israel at the time
[25:56] but we're going to be
[25:58] thousands millions of brides going to be
[26:00] all over the world walking around and
[26:02] doing things
[26:03] in the temple
[26:04] talking to people
[26:06] i believe we'll be able to teach people
[26:09] because if there is a fifth sealed jew
[26:12] or somebody like that that's raised up
[26:14] in the millennium
[26:15] or the heathen what better for me and
[26:18] you to talk to them and tell them about
[26:19] redemption
[26:20] tell about how they got there
[26:23] they might just appear somewhere and
[26:24] they don't know how they got there well
[26:26] you can tell them how they got there
[26:28] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[26:29] together and the lion shall eat straw
[26:31] like the bullock
[26:32] and thus shall be the serpent's meat
[26:34] that shall not hurt nor destroy in all
[26:35] my holy mountain
[26:38] saith the lord let's go to isaiah 66 22
[26:40] this is where we stopped it today this
[26:42] morning
[26:45] for as the new heavens and the new earth
[26:48] which i will make
[26:50] shall remain before me saith the lord so
[26:52] shall your seed
[26:54] and your name remain
[26:57] now watch and it shall come to pass that
[26:59] from one new moon to another
[27:05] one new moon a calendar
[27:07] 30 days
[27:09] because see they got they got to live a
[27:11] thousand years of natural time
[27:14] so there's going to be days and nights
[27:16] and there's going to be months and years
[27:18] a thousand of them
[27:20] and it shall come to pass that from one
[27:22] new moon to another and from one what
[27:25] sabbath
[27:26] to another
[27:28] shall all flesh come to worship before
[27:31] me saith the lord and they shall go
[27:35] forth and look upon the carcasses of the
[27:36] men that have transgressed against me
[27:38] for the worm shall not die neither shall
[27:40] their fire be quenched
[27:42] and like i said before i don't know how
[27:44] you interpret that but
[27:45] i mean when we come back in the
[27:47] millennium if it was an atomic fire you
[27:49] never know what you're going to see
[27:50] because remember see it's not a
[27:52] cleansing of the earth for god and to be
[27:54] a holy place for him to be per se like
[27:57] it's going to be in the future home
[27:59] because the atomic fire is not going to
[28:01] destroy everything obviously we got to
[28:03] have trees to build
[28:05] for them to build the tabernacle with
[28:07] there's going to have to be iron and
[28:09] steel and ore and different things
[28:12] and
[28:13] a certain kind of economy
[28:16] in the millennium
[28:18] but see not in the future home
[28:21] see the way i see it is is we we're we
[28:24] live in this world here this is our
[28:25] world that we communicate with and we
[28:27] live here and we do we drive cars and we
[28:30] work and we do this and we go to school
[28:31] and we do all this stuff then now when
[28:34] that cleansing happens and we step into
[28:36] the millennium it's not don't get me
[28:38] wrong it's not so much that we have
[28:41] we can we can we say well we've lived
[28:43] here
[28:44] then the next stepping stone is going to
[28:46] be the millennium which is a little bit
[28:48] like this
[28:49] but a little bit more like this
[28:53] then we're going to step into the future
[28:54] home which is nothing like any of that
[28:58] and i thank god because see it's not
[29:00] just an instant thing we're going to be
[29:03] we know we've been humans we know we
[29:05] lived in flesh we knew we we know we had
[29:08] an economy we know that those things
[29:10] happen we we know that the bible tells
[29:12] us they're going to have to build houses
[29:14] and them inhabit then when we step into
[29:16] the millennium then we're there and
[29:17] we've got
[29:18] more of the mind of christ
[29:20] but we know that we're still we were
[29:22] humans in human flesh
[29:24] and then when we step over into the
[29:26] future home
[29:27] all that's going to be done away with
[29:29] but the filter of our mind we're still
[29:31] going to remember brother brown said
[29:33] you'll still remember who you were
[29:34] married to
[29:35] you'll still remember who your children
[29:37] were and what in the world are we going
[29:39] to talk about we're going to talk about
[29:40] the time we had
[29:42] while we were on the earth
[29:44] but not the bad stuff it'll be all the
[29:46] good things
[29:48] all right so you never know you may be
[29:50] able to see this
[29:52] and they shall be in the pouring unto
[29:53] all flesh all right let's continue on
[29:57] isaiah 2
[30:00] verse 1.
[30:03] the word of isaiah the son of a moose
[30:04] saw concerning judah in jerusalem and it
[30:07] shall come to pass in the last days
[30:09] that the mountain of the lord's house
[30:11] shall be established in the top of the
[30:13] mountains
[30:15] remember what's going to happen the
[30:16] mount of olives have you seen the
[30:18] melamine
[30:19] it's not very high is it
[30:21] brother rush has been in jerusalem
[30:23] several times
[30:24] but it's not very high but it's still a
[30:26] mountain
[30:28] the bible says it'll cleave one side to
[30:29] the other and the city will push up now
[30:31] listen
[30:32] you can take that as a city over here
[30:34] and you can take that as a city over
[30:35] here because where they're going to
[30:36] build that mountain at i mean where
[30:37] they're going to build that city
[30:39] it's on top of a mountain
[30:41] and shall be exalted above the hills and
[30:43] all nations look
[30:45] nations
[30:47] there's got to be nations
[30:49] all nations shall flow unto it
[30:53] and many people shall go and say come ye
[30:55] and let us go up to the mountain of the
[30:57] lord to the house of the god of jacob
[30:59] and he will teach us
[31:02] now let's go back to that he
[31:04] if she is him
[31:07] then that he is part of you
[31:10] you'll be able to teach
[31:12] the world what you know
[31:15] and he will teach us of his ways and we
[31:17] will walk in his path for out of zion
[31:19] shall go forth the law
[31:21] and the word of the lord from jerusalem
[31:23] and he shall judge among the nations
[31:26] and shall rebuke many people
[31:28] and they shall beat their swords into
[31:30] plowshares and their spears into pruning
[31:32] hooks
[31:33] nations shall not lift up sword against
[31:36] nation neither shall they learn war
[31:40] anymore so it looks like there's going
[31:41] to be an economy looks like there's
[31:43] going to be nations looks like they're
[31:45] going to be something that they shall
[31:46] rebuke many people
[31:48] maybe get out of line a little bit i
[31:50] don't know that's what i mean you've got
[31:52] an imperfect world that we're going to
[31:53] do away with but we're coming right back
[31:55] and we're going to live in a millennium
[31:57] which is still got the devil still alive
[31:59] which still he's going to be raised up
[32:01] to do his thing and you still got people
[32:05] physically building houses and
[32:07] physically laboring and there's a nation
[32:09] nations
[32:11] and there's swords and plowshares and
[32:13] spears and pruning hooks
[32:15] but see when you get over into that
[32:17] future home
[32:18] none of that's coming
[32:21] none of that's gonna come into the
[32:22] future home we're not gonna have to get
[32:24] over in the future home and go now you
[32:26] need to take that you need to take that
[32:27] spear and make a no there won't be no
[32:30] spear
[32:31] but they still will have an economy
[32:33] because remember the kings of the earth
[32:35] bring their
[32:37] glory into the city and present it and
[32:39] get a leaf off the tree of life and walk
[32:42] out so there's got to be kings so there
[32:45] must be a kingdom
[32:48] an economy maybe you might say
[32:51] there's got to be some kind of hierarchy
[32:53] or you just have no kings
[32:55] amen
[32:56] all right so let's read now jeremiah 33
[32:58] verse 10
[33:02] thus saith the lord
[33:04] again there shall be heard in this place
[33:06] which you say shall be desolate without
[33:09] man and without beast now something's
[33:10] going to be heard that something is
[33:12] desolate
[33:13] then it's going to be heard even in the
[33:15] cities of judah and in the streets of
[33:18] the of jerusalem that are desolate
[33:21] without man and without inhabitant and
[33:23] without beast now you're going to hear
[33:26] something because all this
[33:29] at the battle of armageddon
[33:31] is going to be empty
[33:34] okay
[33:34] the battle of armageddon this is all
[33:36] going to be empty everybody's going to
[33:37] die there's going to have to be somebody
[33:39] reappear
[33:40] and give this look the voice of joy
[33:43] and the voice of gladness the voice of
[33:45] the bridegroom and the voice of the
[33:48] bride
[33:49] now israel's not the bride
[33:53] we are
[33:55] so when we come back into the millennium
[33:57] we're going to come back and the voice
[34:00] is going to be heard the voice of them
[34:02] that shall say praise the lord of host
[34:05] for the lord is good for his mercy
[34:06] endureth forever and of them that shall
[34:08] bring the sacrifice of praise
[34:10] into the house of the lord
[34:15] they bring the sacrifice of praise
[34:17] listen there's not going to be
[34:18] sacrifices like bullocks and stuff like
[34:20] that but it's a sacrifice of praise
[34:24] into the house of the lord where are we
[34:26] going to be we're going to be in the
[34:27] house of the lord
[34:30] all right
[34:32] what did i get for i will cause to
[34:34] return the captivity of the land as at
[34:38] the first saith the lord
[34:42] thus saith the lord of hosts again in
[34:44] this place
[34:45] which is desolate without man and
[34:47] without beast and in all the cities
[34:49] thereof shall be in habitation
[34:52] of shepherds
[34:54] causing their flocks to lie down
[35:00] there's your economy
[35:03] and you can take that spiritually that's
[35:04] okay but that i'm talk listen this is
[35:06] talking about a natural place
[35:09] this is not spiritualizing anything this
[35:11] is the natural place that's gonna happen
[35:13] all right in the cities of the mountains
[35:16] in the cities of the vale so there must
[35:18] not going to be just one city
[35:20] they're going to build cities and
[35:21] inhabit them in the millennium in the
[35:24] cities of the vale and in the cities of
[35:26] the south in the land of benjamin and in
[35:29] the places about jerusalem and in the
[35:32] cities of judah shall the flocks pass
[35:34] again under the hands of him that
[35:36] telleth them saith the lord
[35:39] wow
[35:40] going back to old times i guess
[35:43] in those days and at that time will i
[35:45] cause the branch
[35:47] jesus christ we know of righteousness to
[35:49] grow up unto david
[35:53] and he shall what execute judgment and
[35:57] righteousness in the land there's that
[35:58] son of david sitting on the throne
[36:00] executing judgment and righteousness
[36:03] for thus saith the lord david shall
[36:05] never want a man to sit upon the throne
[36:08] of the house of israel there's your son
[36:10] of david prophecy that god will never
[36:15] take a man off
[36:16] and who is this david the david is the
[36:18] branch david's not the real david the
[36:20] real david's not going to be sitting on
[36:22] the throne
[36:23] it's going to be the son of david which
[36:25] is jesus christ the promised son
[36:27] to sit on the throne
[36:29] and look
[36:30] david shall never want a man to sin upon
[36:32] the throne of the house
[36:35] of israel or the domain of israel
[36:38] everybody got that say ma'am
[36:40] all right
[36:41] well y'all real sleepy today bob we're
[36:43] gonna have to we're gonna have to stand
[36:45] up and hire hiya
[36:50] i know this has been long it's been 35
[36:52] sermons but we're coming to an end if it
[36:54] bores you then you need the holy ghost
[37:00] any word of god bores you you need the
[37:02] baptism of the holy ghost
[37:06] if somebody just reads you scripture
[37:10] you ought to get something
[37:14] all right
[37:16] so now let's go to let's read
[37:17] revelations 20 verse one
[37:21] and i saw an angel come down from heaven
[37:23] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[37:24] a great chain in his hand now this is
[37:26] going to have to happen sometime after
[37:28] the battle of armageddon i don't know
[37:30] when don't know where to put it into
[37:32] place but it has to be before the
[37:34] millennium begins because he's going to
[37:37] be bound 1 000 years everybody got that
[37:40] so sometime after the battle of
[37:42] armageddon
[37:44] something's going to happen to the satan
[37:45] they're going to somebody's going to the
[37:47] angel is going to bind him in the
[37:49] bottomless pit
[37:50] with a great chain now remember
[37:53] young adults kids old adults it's not a
[37:56] chain
[37:57] it's not a log chain
[37:59] it's a chain the prophet of god said a
[38:01] chain of circumstances because he can't
[38:03] work
[38:05] in a group of people that don't have any
[38:07] part of him
[38:09] that he's not part of anybody
[38:12] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[38:14] serpent which is the devil and satan and
[38:16] bound him a thousand years
[38:19] and cast him into the bottomless pit and
[38:21] shut him up
[38:22] and put a seal on him
[38:24] that he should deceive the nations no
[38:26] more
[38:27] till the thousand years should be
[38:29] finished and after that he must be
[38:32] loosed a little season he's going to
[38:34] give the devil one more opportunity
[38:38] it's just one more because he's fixing
[38:39] to be cast into the lake of fire
[38:42] and i saw thrones
[38:44] and they sat upon them and judgment was
[38:45] given unto them judgment was given unto
[38:48] who
[38:48] us them
[38:50] the bride
[38:51] and i saw the souls of them that were
[38:53] beheaded for the witness of jesus he
[38:54] talked about us
[38:55] for the word of god and which had not
[38:57] worshipped the beast remember everybody
[39:00] that worshiped that didn't worship the
[39:01] beast had the seal of god which is the
[39:03] baptism of the holy ghost all right
[39:06] so now which had not worshiped the beast
[39:08] neither his image neither had received
[39:10] his mark on his in their forehead
[39:12] because remember you receive the mark of
[39:14] the beast you're going to have to come
[39:16] to go to judgment
[39:18] you're going to have to be judged for
[39:20] what you've got in your mind
[39:23] because you didn't have it cleaned out
[39:24] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:27] i mean look
[39:28] this group of people right here is the
[39:31] bride
[39:34] down through the church ages beheaded
[39:36] for the witness of jesus christ and for
[39:38] the word of god which didn't worship the
[39:40] beast that's now neither his image
[39:43] neither had received his mark upon their
[39:45] forehead that's now
[39:46] or in their hands and they lived and
[39:48] reigned with christ a thousand years
[39:50] remember
[39:51] only the bride 144 000 that i can put
[39:54] into a group is going to be able to do
[39:56] that
[39:57] but the rest of the dead live not again
[40:00] now whoever died in the battle of
[40:02] armageddon
[40:04] is going to have to stay dead
[40:06] for a thousand years
[40:08] more
[40:10] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[40:13] until the thousand years were finished
[40:15] this is the first resurrection what is
[40:17] the first resurrection the resurrection
[40:19] of the saints
[40:21] which the second death has no part
[40:24] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[40:26] the first resurrection look on such the
[40:29] second death hath no power what is the
[40:31] second death
[40:33] white throne judgment
[40:35] second death is white throne judgment
[40:37] all right
[40:38] on such the second death hath no power
[40:40] but they shall be priest of god and of
[40:42] christ and shall reign look reign with
[40:45] him a thousand years
[40:47] right so there's your point that i want
[40:49] to make it reign with him for a thousand
[40:52] years not that he's just raining and
[40:53] we're just kind of walking and i do make
[40:55] a point that it's
[40:57] it's well there's a honeymoon but like i
[40:59] said before we're not just gonna sit
[41:01] there like zombies all for a thousand
[41:02] years no we're gonna have things to do
[41:04] we're going to rule and reign with him
[41:07] a thousand years i like to think of it
[41:10] as when moses was standing there and and
[41:13] jethro said moses and man said there's
[41:15] way too much on you sid said you need
[41:17] some help
[41:18] and so god took the spirit of moses
[41:21] right the spirit that was on moses and
[41:23] divided it among 70 people so they can
[41:26] judge
[41:27] the smaller matters of the earth well
[41:29] that's the same way with god
[41:32] he's going to allow the judgment to be
[41:34] with all of us
[41:36] listen if we judge angels and we going
[41:38] to judge the earth a thousand years from
[41:40] now why can't we do some judging in the
[41:42] millennium
[41:45] luke 1 verse 31.
[41:48] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[41:50] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[41:52] call his name jesus now this is
[41:54] gabriel in front of mary he shall be
[41:57] great and shall be called the son of the
[41:58] highest and the lord god shall give unto
[42:00] him the throne of his father david
[42:03] there's the promise
[42:04] and he shall reign over the house of
[42:06] jacob forever and of his kingdom
[42:10] there shall be no end now what is the
[42:11] kingdom of god the baptism of the holy
[42:13] ghost which is us
[42:15] all right so there's and there's the
[42:16] promise of having
[42:19] someone on the throne
[42:22] father david which is the son of
[42:24] son of the highest
[42:26] and he shall reign over the house of
[42:28] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[42:30] shall be
[42:31] no end let's go to jeremiah 23 verse 5
[42:35] behold the days come saith the lord that
[42:37] i will raise unto david a righteous
[42:39] branch a king shall reign and prosper
[42:42] and shall execute judgment and justice
[42:44] in the earth he's talking about the
[42:45] millennium
[42:48] in his day judas shall be saved
[42:50] so it can't be now
[42:52] judah shall be saved and israel shall
[42:55] dwell safely that ain't happening now i
[42:57] promise you that
[42:58] and this is his name whereby he shall be
[43:01] called the lord
[43:03] of righteousness therefore behold the
[43:06] days come saith the lord that they shall
[43:08] no more say the lord liveth which
[43:10] brought up the children of israel out of
[43:12] the land of egypt but the lord liveth
[43:15] which brought up in which led the seed
[43:17] of the house of israel out of the north
[43:19] country and from all the countries and
[43:21] what's the north country russia
[43:24] where did a lot of the jews come from
[43:25] they come out of russia they were driven
[43:27] out of russia actually
[43:29] millions of them
[43:30] all right and from all countries whether
[43:33] i had driven them
[43:35] so he drove them out we don't been
[43:37] through that before and they shall dwell
[43:39] in their own land so they're back into
[43:40] the homeland now
[43:42] getting ready for this now listen let's
[43:44] go to number three
[43:48] this is going to brother branham is
[43:50] going to tell us he's going to get about
[43:52] the millennium so time never ceased
[43:54] until the this must be a
[43:55] post-millennialist or something that
[43:57] asked the question because see
[43:59] we got a thousand years after the church
[44:01] has gone home and comes back upon the
[44:03] earth
[44:05] then time ceases in the new heaven and
[44:07] the earth now the millennium is not the
[44:09] new heaven and new earth
[44:11] all right you got that
[44:13] even though we read in isaiah where it
[44:16] says i create new heavens and a new
[44:17] earth
[44:18] okay
[44:20] now the millennium is not the new
[44:21] heavens and the new earth there will
[44:23] still be sin
[44:25] after the millennium
[44:28] because the devil's going to be alive
[44:29] the imps or the the spirits are going to
[44:31] still be alive
[44:32] and then the sinners are going to have
[44:34] to come up out of the grave and give an
[44:35] account of what they did so sin is going
[44:37] to be there the whole time
[44:38] there will still be sin after the
[44:40] millennium the millennium is a type of
[44:42] noah going into the ark and carried over
[44:45] and brought ham in them on the other
[44:47] side and sin even came out of the ark we
[44:50] know that came through ham right but
[44:52] enoch the translated one was a type of
[44:55] the bride that went up
[44:57] not the one that was carried over so sin
[44:59] will still be on the other side of the
[45:01] millennium but not during the millennium
[45:06] right because it's going out to be
[45:07] loosed after the thousand years during
[45:09] the millennium is peace see
[45:11] but sin will be dealt with the other
[45:13] side of the millennium and then
[45:16] time fades out
[45:19] let's go to number four questions and
[45:21] answers same thing
[45:23] so let me ask you another question where
[45:24] is that one that's going to sow that
[45:26] seed for that end time church
[45:28] where is that ripening seed that
[45:30] promised elijah and immediately after
[45:32] his days shall the great tribulation set
[45:35] in and burn the earth he's talking about
[45:36] himself
[45:37] and then at the return of the church
[45:40] and the bride the bride in christ shall
[45:43] walk out upon their ashes
[45:45] in the millennium
[45:46] now they're not going to walk out
[45:47] there's a doctrine in the in the message
[45:50] that we're going to walk out on our own
[45:52] ashes
[45:54] in other words our bodies going to be
[45:55] burnt
[45:56] we're going to have a new one somewhere
[45:59] else and we're going to step into this
[46:01] new one and walk out because if you look
[46:03] if you
[46:04] if you
[46:06] read that different
[46:09] and then at the return of the church and
[46:10] the bride the bride in christ shall walk
[46:12] out upon their ashes now if you read it
[46:14] like that
[46:16] you pretty much see that brother branham
[46:18] is saying they're going to walk out on
[46:19] their own ashes but that's not true
[46:22] no he's going to walk out over the ashes
[46:24] of all the other people that died on the
[46:26] earth
[46:27] because you're going to be in a
[46:27] glorified body and it's going to be your
[46:29] flesh body there's not another one
[46:31] laying somewhere
[46:33] when the earth is purified by fire
[46:36] and there they shall reign and the
[46:38] heathens look this never heard the
[46:40] gospel shall be raised at that time
[46:43] i'm just reading the quote
[46:45] and the sons of god will be manifested
[46:48] if he's to reign he's got to have
[46:50] something to reign over he's got a
[46:52] dominion he said and they ruled and
[46:55] reigned with christ and christ ruled
[46:56] with the rod of iron the nations then
[46:58] the gospel then the manifested sons of
[47:00] god
[47:02] look
[47:02] with the authority
[47:05] just like he had when he was here
[47:09] there'll come the millennium in that
[47:10] rain
[47:12] upon the ashes let's go to number five
[47:14] this is the sixth seal
[47:19] in the time of the millennium it's
[47:21] israel that's a nation
[47:22] the 12 tribes is a nation
[47:25] but the bride is in the palace
[47:28] she's a queen now she's married
[47:30] and all of the earth shall come into
[47:32] this city jerusalem and shall bring the
[47:35] glory of it in there
[47:37] and the gates will not be shut by night
[47:39] because there won't be any night in the
[47:41] city the gates will always be open the
[47:43] kings of the earth now look brother adam
[47:45] takes that same scripture
[47:47] that's supposed to be for the future
[47:49] home and he's putting it into this
[47:51] scripture for the millennium
[47:56] because he's already in revelations 22
[47:57] that's not the millennium
[47:59] that's the future home
[48:01] right
[48:03] bring their honor and glory into this
[48:04] city but the bride is in there with the
[48:06] lamb oh my do you see it in there not
[48:08] the bride
[48:10] isn't going to be out here laboring in
[48:12] the vineyards now he's back where he's
[48:14] in the millennium
[48:16] no sir she's the bride she's the queen
[48:18] of the king it's the others that labor
[48:20] out there the nation
[48:22] not the bride amen so let's go to the
[48:24] next one future home
[48:27] now perfectly noah was the type of those
[48:29] carried over
[48:30] remember when noah came out ham was with
[48:32] him sin was still in there sin went
[48:34] right on over through the ark unbelief
[48:36] doubt went over in the ark
[48:39] went higher than the ark but enoch went
[48:41] higher than the ark he went on into the
[48:43] presence of god but noah went through
[48:44] and came out
[48:45] and there was still sin top of the
[48:47] millennium of the world's condition
[48:49] the millennium is not the end of it
[48:52] there will still be time after the
[48:53] millennium
[48:56] because the white throne judgment can't
[48:57] be an eternity
[49:00] because you got time elements you've got
[49:02] sinners standing there and they're not
[49:03] eternal so you got centers standing
[49:05] there that's still in time
[49:07] all right there will still be time after
[49:09] the millennium the millennium is a space
[49:11] of time but not the new earth look at
[49:14] the capital letter not the new earth no
[49:16] indeed noticed in that we'll get to that
[49:19] after a bit now he's in the future home
[49:22] number seven the future home
[49:25] and notice not the perfect world this
[49:27] millennium
[49:30] you got it
[49:32] not the perfect world
[49:34] this millennium it's the type of the
[49:36] seventh day
[49:37] remember seventh day is what
[49:41] it's not the eighth day eighth day is
[49:42] eternity seventh day still in time
[49:45] so the millennium is still in time
[49:47] then comes the white throne judgment see
[49:49] we still have judgment we're still in
[49:51] time in the millennium it's a day
[49:53] one thousand years it's a time element
[49:56] not don't get that mixed up with the new
[49:59] earth now
[50:00] because it's not
[50:02] so nice read revelations 20 verse 7
[50:06] and when the thousand years are expired
[50:08] satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[50:11] and shall go out to deceive the nations
[50:13] which are in the four quarters of the
[50:14] earth gog and magog
[50:16] to gather them together to battle and
[50:18] the number of whom is as the sands
[50:20] sand of the sea
[50:22] and they went up on the breath of the
[50:23] earth and compassed the camp of the
[50:25] saints about
[50:27] trying one more time
[50:29] they try one more time to defeat the
[50:31] bride
[50:32] or defeat the sainted ones
[50:35] and the beloved city and fire came down
[50:38] from god out of heaven and devoured them
[50:41] and the devil that deceived them was
[50:43] cast into the lake of fire and brimstone
[50:45] where the beast and the false prophet
[50:46] already are
[50:48] and shall be tormented day and night
[50:50] forever
[50:53] and ever not for an eternity though now
[50:55] that's forever
[50:57] and forever now let's read number eight
[50:59] questions and answers
[51:01] 1963 would you please explain how satan
[51:04] is bound a thousand years being loosed
[51:06] again for the battle of revelations 20
[51:08] and 8.
[51:09] that is not the battle of armageddon
[51:13] because that's the battle of gog and
[51:14] magog
[51:16] there's two different battles totally
[51:18] and they totally have different outcomes
[51:21] all right this is not the battle of
[51:23] armageddon the battle of armageddon
[51:25] takes place on this side what this side
[51:27] of what when the tribulation period ends
[51:31] all right the battle of armageddon takes
[51:33] over when the tribulation period has
[51:35] ended
[51:36] and now what relations does this have
[51:38] with the battle of gog and magog none
[51:41] because it's not on this side
[51:43] the battle of gog and magog is on the
[51:45] other side
[51:46] okay everybody got that
[51:48] one is this thousand years and the other
[51:51] is on the end of the thousand years as
[51:54] mentioned in the fourth seal will god
[51:56] he's answering pieces of questions i've
[51:58] got them all read but these are pieces
[51:59] of question this is a question right
[52:02] here as mentioned in the fourth seal
[52:04] will gog and magog be gathered from
[52:05] people on the new earth
[52:07] satan was loosed out of his prison and
[52:09] went together all the people the wicked
[52:11] to bring them to this place
[52:13] and god rained fire and brimstone out of
[52:15] heaven and they were consumed two
[52:17] battles
[52:18] all together
[52:20] so everybody got that
[52:22] all right so now
[52:24] let's go to revelations 20 verse four
[52:27] and i saw thrones and they sat upon them
[52:30] now we see thrones again and judgment
[52:31] was given unto them
[52:33] this is what we read a minute ago i saw
[52:35] the souls of them will be headed but
[52:36] we're going to continue on a little bit
[52:38] further which had not worshipped the
[52:40] beast neither his image neither had
[52:41] received his mark on the forehead or in
[52:43] their hands they lived and reigned with
[52:44] christ a thousand years but the rest of
[52:46] the dead lived not again until the
[52:48] thousand years were finished this is the
[52:50] first resurrection all right
[52:52] blessed and holy
[52:53] see we didn't read that we stopped right
[52:55] there last time but let's go to verse
[52:57] six
[52:58] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[53:01] the first resurrection on such the
[53:02] second death hath no power no we did
[53:04] read this but they shall be priests of
[53:06] god in christ and shall reign with him a
[53:08] thousand years now so thousand years
[53:11] after that millennium is over
[53:13] then you're going to have what you're
[53:14] going to have the white throne judgment
[53:16] all right everybody with me
[53:19] hang on just a little bit longer
[53:21] put you an oxygen mask on or something
[53:24] start sucking some air some of you like
[53:25] you're dead
[53:30] daniel 7 verse 9
[53:34] and i beheld till the thrones were cast
[53:36] down and the ancient of days did sit now
[53:38] remember
[53:39] daniel's commentary in revelations is
[53:41] the same basically
[53:44] he has a jewish angle
[53:47] and revelations has a gentile angle
[53:49] everybody got that
[53:51] okay a jewish angle and a gentile angle
[53:53] so this is the jewish angle
[53:56] he's the ancient of days whose garment
[53:58] was white as snow and the hair of his
[54:00] head like pure wool remember brother
[54:01] brown had a question about that and the
[54:03] angel the lord told him about the white
[54:05] wigged one
[54:06] that it was like the old people over in
[54:09] britain you watch them they put the
[54:11] white wigs on it shows judgment and it
[54:14] shows where they could come into court
[54:16] and the strong was like the fiery flame
[54:17] in his wheels as burning fire
[54:20] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[54:22] from before him thousand thousands
[54:24] ministered unto him and ten thousand
[54:27] times ten thousand stood before him
[54:30] now look thousands times thousands
[54:32] ministered unto him that's the bride
[54:35] and tens times ten 000 stood before him
[54:38] the judgment was set and the books were
[54:41] open
[54:42] i beheld them because of the voice of
[54:43] the great words which the horn spake i
[54:46] beheld even till the beast was slain and
[54:48] his body destroyed and given to the
[54:50] burning flame as concerning the rest of
[54:53] the beast
[54:54] they had their dominion taken away yet
[54:56] their lives were prolonged for a season
[54:58] and a time
[54:59] we'll not get into that that's a long
[55:01] process to talk about but it is pretty
[55:03] interesting i saw in the night vision
[55:05] and behold now remember
[55:06] this is daniel
[55:09] jewish angle
[55:10] this is daniel
[55:13] behold one like the son of man come with
[55:15] clouds of heaven and came to the ancient
[55:18] of days and they brought him near before
[55:20] him and there was given him dominion and
[55:23] glory and a kingdom
[55:25] that all people nations and languages
[55:27] should serve him
[55:28] coming unto the son of david
[55:30] his dominion is an everlasting dominion
[55:33] which shall not pass away and his
[55:35] kingdom that which shall not
[55:38] be destroyed
[55:40] now that's the jewish angle to that same
[55:42] thing same thing is going to happen
[55:44] there's a judgment there's a son of
[55:46] david that's going to sit on the throne
[55:47] in the millennium
[55:49] then you've got an everlasting dominion
[55:51] right here so let's go to revelations
[55:54] 20 verse 11 through 15.
[55:57] and i saw a great white throne in him
[55:59] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[56:00] and the heaven fled away
[56:02] and there was found no place for them
[56:04] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[56:07] before god and the books were opened and
[56:09] another book was open which is the book
[56:11] of life
[56:13] remember there's not going to be a whole
[56:15] bunch of books there
[56:17] remember i preached to you a long time
[56:18] ago called the book of books
[56:22] you're written epistles
[56:24] people said i can read you like a
[56:26] book you're like it your life is an open
[56:30] book so it's not going to be books
[56:32] they're going to be the book
[56:34] the people
[56:35] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[56:37] before god and the books were open and
[56:38] another book was open which is the book
[56:40] of life
[56:41] and the dead were judged out of those
[56:43] things which were written in the books
[56:45] according to their works
[56:48] you don't ever want to stand before god
[56:51] according to your own works
[56:54] never
[56:57] but now remember though they're judged
[56:58] and some people aren't given eternal
[57:00] life
[57:01] because of their works
[57:02] but i don't want to be there i'll forget
[57:04] something
[57:06] i want to be i want to have that taken
[57:08] care of now
[57:09] to where i don't stand before that i
[57:11] stand at the judgment not in judgment
[57:14] all right
[57:15] according to their works and the sea
[57:18] gave up the dead which were entered in
[57:20] death and hell delivered up the dead
[57:21] which were in them see everybody anybody
[57:24] that ever had breath is going to go to
[57:25] the white throne judgment except the
[57:27] bride of jesus christ all right
[57:30] now i don't understand about
[57:32] um
[57:33] you know all the babies he says all
[57:34] babies go to heaven i don't know if they
[57:36] automatically go to heaven or they have
[57:37] to i mean what are they going to be
[57:39] judged by
[57:41] they can't be judged unless they get to
[57:43] the age of accountability so there's no
[57:45] way to judge them so i don't know if
[57:46] they just automatically going in but i
[57:48] thank god for a prophet that said all
[57:50] babies go to heaven
[57:51] okay
[57:52] and the age of accountability we know 12
[57:54] 14 years old somewhere in there
[57:57] when you can realize that you have
[57:58] sinned
[58:00] and death and hell were cast into the
[58:01] lake of fire this is the second death
[58:04] and whosoever was not found written in
[58:06] the book of life was cast into the lake
[58:09] of fire there's a group of people folks
[58:11] that's not even in the book
[58:16] they're just dead they're just sinners
[58:18] they're not their works is not even
[58:20] going to be worth anything i mean why
[58:21] would you
[58:22] why would you want to i know they're
[58:23] going to they're all going to be judged
[58:25] but
[58:26] remember there's parts of the book that
[58:27] you can be transferred names can be
[58:29] transferred over and some can be erased
[58:31] out like judas can be erased out but
[58:33] there's a group of people it's just
[58:35] going to be they're just sinners
[58:38] and whosoever was not found written in
[58:39] the book of life was cast into the lake
[58:41] of fire all right let's go to number
[58:43] nine
[58:45] questions and answers jeffersonville
[58:47] 1954.
[58:49] look at this morning's lesson when the
[58:50] judgment was set the books were open now
[58:52] jesus came with 10 000 times 10 000 of
[58:55] saints and then the judgment was set
[58:58] here they all are around the white
[58:59] throne judgment as we went through the
[59:01] scripture with it and the books were
[59:03] opened and another book was open which
[59:05] was the book of life
[59:07] and these in the rapture was judging
[59:10] them
[59:13] the bride
[59:15] and these in because who only takes the
[59:17] rapture only the bride takes the rapture
[59:19] all right not the foolish virgin
[59:22] now the 144 000 take their separate
[59:24] rapture but it's not the first
[59:26] resurrection
[59:27] everybody got that
[59:29] everybody got that
[59:32] okay
[59:34] and these in the rapture was judging
[59:36] them is that right them had done went
[59:38] home and received their glorified bodies
[59:40] and lived through the millennium was
[59:42] hearing the white throne judgment
[59:44] judging those and he said he would
[59:45] separate the sheep
[59:48] from the goats so let's go to matthew 25
[59:50] 31
[59:52] when the son of man shall come in his
[59:54] glory and all the holy angels with him
[59:56] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[59:58] glory
[59:59] and before him shall be gathered on
[1:00:01] nations and he shall separate them one
[1:00:03] from another as as a shepherd
[1:00:06] divideth his sheep
[1:00:09] from the goats because remember they're
[1:00:10] not sheep
[1:00:12] we're sheep
[1:00:14] but he's doing it as a shepherd would
[1:00:16] divide the sheep from the goat
[1:00:19] and he shall set the sheep on his right
[1:00:21] side but the goats on the left then
[1:00:24] shall the king say unto them on his
[1:00:25] right hand come you blessed of my father
[1:00:28] inherit the kingdom prepared from you
[1:00:31] for you
[1:00:32] from the foundation of the world for i
[1:00:34] was a hunger then you gave me meat
[1:00:37] i was thirsty and you gave me drink now
[1:00:38] look that's not the bride
[1:00:42] that's the somebody that did this to the
[1:00:44] bride
[1:00:46] because remember that i when i i was
[1:00:49] hungered
[1:00:51] it's me and you
[1:00:52] that's the cup of water in my name
[1:00:54] that's the change in your tire on the
[1:00:56] side of the road that's the opening the
[1:00:58] door for you and
[1:00:59] and you know
[1:01:01] helping you out in things for i was
[1:01:04] hungry then you gave me meat i was
[1:01:05] thirsty you gave me drink i was a
[1:01:08] stranger and you took me in
[1:01:10] naked and you clothed me i was sick and
[1:01:12] you visited me i was in prison and you
[1:01:14] came unto me
[1:01:16] then shall the righteous answer him
[1:01:18] saying
[1:01:20] when saw we the hungered and fed thee
[1:01:23] are thirsty and gave thee drink
[1:01:28] when saw we thee a stranger and took the
[1:01:31] in or naked and clothed them or when saw
[1:01:33] we thee sick or in prison and came unto
[1:01:35] thee listen they had no idea what they
[1:01:37] were doing
[1:01:39] so it can't be the bride
[1:01:42] the bride don't get a cup of water i
[1:01:43] mean they receive it but they're not the
[1:01:45] ones that give it all right
[1:01:47] you don't get eternal life and be called
[1:01:49] bride just giving a cup of water to
[1:01:51] somebody no you have to be born again
[1:01:54] all right these people were not born
[1:01:56] again because they're at the white
[1:01:58] throne judgment
[1:01:59] being judged so there's no way their
[1:02:01] bride
[1:02:02] and the king shall answer and say unto
[1:02:04] them verily i say unto you in as much as
[1:02:06] you have done it unto one
[1:02:08] of the least
[1:02:10] he says of these brethren so he must be
[1:02:14] pointing to all the people standing
[1:02:15] around him
[1:02:20] and as much as you have done it unto one
[1:02:22] of the least of these my brethren you
[1:02:24] have done it unto me then shall he say
[1:02:27] also unto them on the left side depart
[1:02:28] from me you cursed into everlasting fire
[1:02:31] prepared for the devil and his angels
[1:02:34] for i was a hundred and you gave me no
[1:02:35] meat
[1:02:37] i was thirsty and you gave me no drink
[1:02:40] i was a stranger and you took me not in
[1:02:42] naked and you clothed me not sick and in
[1:02:44] prison and you visited me not then shall
[1:02:47] they also answer him saying lord when
[1:02:49] saw we thee hungered or thirst or
[1:02:51] strange or naked or sick or in prison
[1:02:53] did not minister unto thee then shall he
[1:02:55] answer and say verily i say unto you
[1:02:57] inasmuch as you did not
[1:02:59] to one of the least of these you did it
[1:03:02] not to me
[1:03:03] and these shall go away into everlasting
[1:03:05] punishment but the righteous
[1:03:08] into life
[1:03:10] eternal
[1:03:12] wow
[1:03:14] because you did it to the least of my
[1:03:17] little ones
[1:03:19] because they're sitting there going we
[1:03:20] never saw you lord
[1:03:23] we never saw you physically we see you
[1:03:24] now we we've never saw your person he
[1:03:26] said no but you did it to this person
[1:03:28] right here you did it to this person
[1:03:30] right here you did it to one of these
[1:03:32] least of my little ones you did it to
[1:03:34] this person and he'll point them out and
[1:03:36] they'll go oh
[1:03:37] yeah i changed that one's tire one day
[1:03:39] or i helped that one do this one day or
[1:03:41] i gave them some money one day or this
[1:03:43] and that and the other okay
[1:03:46] so the white throne judgment is going to
[1:03:48] be a bad time but it's going to be a
[1:03:49] time though that where i see grace
[1:03:52] at its apex
[1:03:56] grace at its apex to give eternal life
[1:03:59] to somebody that just gave a cup of
[1:04:01] water to you
[1:04:03] without any strings attached he's going
[1:04:06] to be given eternal life and he's going
[1:04:08] to be told
[1:04:09] who it was
[1:04:11] and he's going to realize that because
[1:04:13] of you
[1:04:14] he got eternal life
[1:04:16] all right let's go to matthew
[1:04:18] 7 verse 21
[1:04:21] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[1:04:22] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:04:24] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[1:04:26] father which is in heaven
[1:04:28] many will say to me in that day
[1:04:31] white throne judgment
[1:04:32] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[1:04:34] name
[1:04:35] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:04:38] that i name thy name have done many
[1:04:41] wonderful works and then will i profess
[1:04:43] unto them i never knew you now if you
[1:04:45] look that word new up k-n-e-w
[1:04:48] that is the same relationship as it
[1:04:50] would be when adam and eve got together
[1:04:52] and had children all right i never knew
[1:04:54] you in other words i never had an
[1:04:55] intimate relationship with you all right
[1:04:58] depart from you me
[1:05:00] you that work iniquity all right let's
[1:05:02] go to first corinthians two verse nine
[1:05:07] we'll finish up here in just a second
[1:05:08] but as it is written
[1:05:10] i have not seen
[1:05:12] nor ear heard neither have entered into
[1:05:14] the heart of man the things which god
[1:05:16] has prepared
[1:05:18] for them that love him
[1:05:21] but god hath revealed them unto us by
[1:05:23] his spirit that's what he's doing now
[1:05:25] for the spirit searches all things yea
[1:05:28] the deep things
[1:05:31] of god all right let's go to revelations
[1:05:33] 21 verse 1. this is the last scripture
[1:05:36] and you can take this scripture and go
[1:05:38] on to revelations 22 and you can read
[1:05:40] about the avenues and the parts and read
[1:05:42] the future home
[1:05:44] and i'll just let you do that
[1:05:47] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:05:50] now it didn't say new heavens it's in
[1:05:52] new heaven
[1:05:53] i saw a new heaven and a new earth for
[1:05:55] the first heaven and the first earth
[1:05:57] were passed away now remember brother
[1:05:59] brown brought that out
[1:06:00] passed away was that long word that he
[1:06:02] couldn't pronounce a neon or whatever
[1:06:04] that is which meant not to annihilate
[1:06:07] but to burn over so he's not going to
[1:06:09] ever destroy the core of the earth he's
[1:06:12] going to destroy the framework of the
[1:06:13] earth he's just going to destroy
[1:06:14] everything around the earth
[1:06:16] and as far as man went down as far as
[1:06:18] went to mars and all the different
[1:06:20] places all right and i john saw the holy
[1:06:22] city new jerusalem look coming down out
[1:06:25] of heaven now the millennium it didn't
[1:06:27] say that it was coming down they said
[1:06:28] they built the houses while they were
[1:06:29] here
[1:06:30] all right so this is after the battle of
[1:06:33] gog and magog this is after god's done
[1:06:35] killed all the
[1:06:37] all the evil
[1:06:38] and everybody's went to their place
[1:06:40] everlasting punishment everlasting life
[1:06:44] here comes a city
[1:06:46] and i john saw the holy city in new
[1:06:48] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[1:06:50] heaven prepared as a bride
[1:06:52] adorned for her husband because it is
[1:06:55] the bride
[1:06:56] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:06:58] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[1:07:01] with men
[1:07:02] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:07:04] shall be his people
[1:07:05] and god himself shall be with them and
[1:07:08] be their god
[1:07:09] no more separation
[1:07:11] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[1:07:13] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:07:15] death
[1:07:16] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[1:07:18] there be any more pain for the former
[1:07:19] things
[1:07:20] are passed away
[1:07:22] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:07:24] behold i make all things new
[1:07:26] and he said unto me right for these
[1:07:28] words are true and faithful
[1:07:30] and he said unto me
[1:07:32] it is done
[1:07:35] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[1:07:37] the end
[1:07:38] i will give unto him that is the thirst
[1:07:40] of the fountain of water of life freely
[1:07:46] and you know in the bible there's
[1:07:48] seven church ages and there's seven
[1:07:50] overcomings and each there's a church
[1:07:52] age that has an overcoming in every age
[1:07:54] right so that's seven
[1:07:56] there's an eighth one
[1:07:59] there's an eighth which puts you into
[1:08:01] eternity
[1:08:02] okay
[1:08:03] he that overcometh
[1:08:05] shall inherit all things boy that to me
[1:08:07] that's just that lays it out
[1:08:10] that that that what that brother says
[1:08:12] that explains everything
[1:08:15] if god tells you
[1:08:17] that you have inherited all things
[1:08:20] he means all things
[1:08:22] amen and i will be his god and he shall
[1:08:24] be my son but the fearful and
[1:08:26] unbelieving and the abominable and the
[1:08:28] murderers whoremongers sorcerers
[1:08:30] idolaters liars shall have their part in
[1:08:32] the lake of burning with fire and
[1:08:33] brimstone which is the second death
[1:08:35] and there came unto me one of the seven
[1:08:37] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:08:39] the seven left plagues and talked to me
[1:08:40] saying look
[1:08:42] come hither i will show thee the bride
[1:08:44] the lamb's wife i'm gonna read you one
[1:08:47] more quote i read it a long time ago
[1:08:49] they don't have it back there but if
[1:08:50] some questions and answers
[1:08:52] brother brown said the church ages ended
[1:08:54] or the question is the church ages ended
[1:08:56] and blacked out the bride is called we
[1:08:58] have already entered in the tribulation
[1:09:00] no no no
[1:09:02] i wish that i could have more time on
[1:09:04] that
[1:09:04] the bride when she's taken from the
[1:09:06] church this is the order of events
[1:09:08] that'll take us to where we're going
[1:09:12] the bride when she's taken from the
[1:09:13] church
[1:09:15] then the church age will cease
[1:09:17] laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes
[1:09:20] to glory and the tribulation period sets
[1:09:23] in upon the sleeping virgin for three
[1:09:25] and a half years while israel is getting
[1:09:27] this prophecy
[1:09:28] then tribulation sets in upon israel
[1:09:31] we've uncovered all this
[1:09:32] and then comes the battle of armageddon
[1:09:34] which destroys all things
[1:09:37] and then the bride returns back with the
[1:09:39] groom for a thousand years the
[1:09:41] millennium reign
[1:09:42] after that comes the white throne
[1:09:44] judgment after that comes the new heaven
[1:09:46] and new earth and the new city coming
[1:09:48] down from god out of heaven
[1:09:51] eternity and time
[1:09:53] blends together
[1:09:55] eternity and time that's what we're
[1:09:57] looking for folks
[1:09:59] eternity and time
[1:10:01] blends together
[1:10:07] that word eternity
[1:10:10] oh yeah we're sitting in heaven places
[1:10:11] and all this but we still got to go to
[1:10:13] work tomorrow
[1:10:15] we still got to do the things but now
[1:10:16] when we come to this new city
[1:10:20] behold i make all things new
[1:10:23] he that overcometh will get
[1:10:26] all things
[1:10:29] and when he said it was finished
[1:10:32] it is done
[1:10:34] he said it was it is finished at calvary
[1:10:36] he said it is done what when you do
[1:10:38] something and get it done it's done
[1:10:40] and god said it's done but you know what
[1:10:42] you you take that and you think man then
[1:10:44] this it's just done
[1:10:46] no that begins
[1:10:49] that begins your eternal destination
[1:10:52] from the future home all the way for an
[1:10:54] eternity
[1:10:56] when he said it's done
[1:10:59] he means all the other things the bible
[1:11:01] has been fulfilled
[1:11:03] because see where revelations 22 the
[1:11:05] bible he's saying it is done
[1:11:07] everything's been fulfilled everybody is
[1:11:10] in the place they're supposed to be in
[1:11:11] the devil's done away with the the all
[1:11:14] the dimensions are emptied up and the
[1:11:16] ones that are going to burn for
[1:11:18] forever they're already where they're
[1:11:20] supposed to be the bride is where she's
[1:11:22] supposed to be there's going to be a
[1:11:24] city come down we're going to live in
[1:11:26] the city and then all the other people
[1:11:28] is going to live on this earth around
[1:11:29] about
[1:11:31] see the people can come into the sitting
[1:11:34] but they got to leave
[1:11:37] so you come visit me that's fine
[1:11:40] but at a point in time you gotta leave
[1:11:43] because it's my house
[1:11:45] right
[1:11:48] that's the same way with the future home
[1:11:50] that future home is the bride's house
[1:11:53] not a millennium
[1:11:54] not of this or that or the other that's
[1:11:56] my house
[1:11:58] you can come and visit me now i'm gonna
[1:11:59] talk about y'all i'm talking about the
[1:12:01] foolish virgin the cup of water in my
[1:12:03] name the children that are given eternal
[1:12:05] life people that are giving an eternal
[1:12:06] life they're gonna have to live on the
[1:12:07] outside of that city
[1:12:09] and there will be an economy there i
[1:12:11] don't know if they're gonna plant stuff
[1:12:13] and bring it in but i like what brother
[1:12:14] claude said because
[1:12:17] in the economy that's set up if you take
[1:12:20] and and make your crops
[1:12:22] you bring a tenth of that crop in as a
[1:12:24] tithe
[1:12:26] and you can if you've got
[1:12:28] 10 billion people on the outside of the
[1:12:31] city
[1:12:32] and only 1 billion on the inside
[1:12:34] those 10 billion can give 10 of what
[1:12:36] they produce and it'll you know we're
[1:12:39] not going to need that but still it'd be
[1:12:40] nice i like beans and i like taters
[1:12:44] i like squash okra
[1:12:47] tomatoes
[1:12:49] um right
[1:12:52] and we're not going to do away with that
[1:12:54] i don't think
[1:12:55] i i think the the bible says the trees
[1:12:58] are going to draw have 12 manners of
[1:13:00] fruit why would it do 12 different kinds
[1:13:03] of fruit
[1:13:04] because it's a variety
[1:13:07] it's a variety god's got this thing all
[1:13:09] set up for us but we're going to have to
[1:13:10] live through it it's going to be part of
[1:13:12] our it's got to be part of our journey

[1:16:48] is well
[1:16:51] you know there's not even going to be
[1:16:53] this
[1:16:54] the future home we're not going we're
[1:16:56] not going to have daylight and dark
[1:16:58] he said the lamb would be the light you
[1:17:00] read it we won't have day or night in
[1:17:03] that city
[1:17:05] and lights always be on but you know
[1:17:06] what they're gonna there's gonna be one
[1:17:08] thing missing
[1:17:12] and that's the tabernacle
[1:17:16] it won't have a need for a tabernacle
[1:17:19] you and i
[1:17:21] the bible says the tabernacle is now
[1:17:23] with man
[1:17:25] and that'll be me and you will be the
[1:17:27] inhabitation
[1:17:28] of god
[1:17:30] not a building
[1:17:33] but thank god he's made us a future home
[1:17:35] though
[1:17:36] that's going to be perfect to what we
[1:17:38] wanted
[1:17:40] when we started our journey
[1:17:42] you probably didn't even think about a
[1:17:43] city or a future home you just trying to
[1:17:45] struggle to get through life
[1:17:47] you were trying to struggle to serve god
[1:17:49] but god was sitting there making that
[1:17:51] city for you the whole time
[1:17:54] and then thank god he sent us a prophet
[1:17:58] that could navigate us through this
[1:17:59] whole thing take away all the fear of
[1:18:02] well we don't know what's going to
[1:18:03] happen here we don't know what's going
[1:18:04] to happen here
[1:18:06] no the bible told us already it just
[1:18:08] took a prophetic prophet to bring us
[1:18:11] that part
[1:18:13] that we needed to take the fear away
[1:18:15] from us
[1:18:16] why would we fear death anymore when we
[1:18:18] know brother brown said lord don't miss
[1:18:20] it
[1:18:22] don't miss it please don't miss it he
[1:18:24] said that's so glorious he said he said
[1:18:26] don't worry about it he said
[1:18:28] that's where you're going
[1:18:30] you're not going to sleep in a grave
[1:18:31] you're not going to be in a dark place
[1:18:33] you're going in a sixth dimension where
[1:18:35] god is
[1:18:36] the spirit of god is and all the other
[1:18:38] people in your group's going to be right
[1:18:40] there together so he took all the fear
[1:18:43] away and then he navigated us through
[1:18:44] the resurrection through the through the
[1:18:47] uh change of the body through the
[1:18:48] ascension and took us right on into the
[1:18:51] millennium saying well the millenniums
[1:18:52] not we ain't got it don't worry you
[1:18:54] ain't got to build a house
[1:18:56] that's for the jews
[1:18:58] your house is coming
[1:19:01] and it's going to be built by the divine
[1:19:02] hand of god
[1:19:04] not by man's hand
[1:19:06] and this down here is going to be
[1:19:08] destroyed in the millennium but up there
[1:19:09] is not going to be destroyed in that
[1:19:11] future home
[1:19:12] so thank god i thank god listen we have
[1:19:14] a lot of trials and troubles and
[1:19:16] tribulations but if you'll believe this
[1:19:18] message of the hour and get in it and
[1:19:19] dig and dig and dig it will have to take
[1:19:22] some of the fear away from you
