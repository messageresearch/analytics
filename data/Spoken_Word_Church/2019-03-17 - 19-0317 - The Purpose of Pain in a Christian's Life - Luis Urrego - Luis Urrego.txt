Patrick today we want to just read this little thing that brother dos passing around that way we appreciate him passing around the Gazette this morning thanks for extra read all about it is it okay brother jump yes okay alright says here green wasn't always the color of st. Patrick's Day paintings show the patron saint wearing blue robes and the official color of the garment order of st. Patrick was sky blue in 1541 British monarch Henry the eighth declared himself the king of Ireland indeed the country a royal blue coat of arms but as this enchantment with British rule grew over the centuries the Irish adopted green as a symbol of rebellion when you go back when you go back in history you realized why don't we do the things we do today and then you know you come back over all the st. Patrick's Day used to be a solemn commemoration of the day he died in 1927 Irish officials even banned the sale of alcohol on his name day as well as on Christmas and dip front partly at the insistence of the Catholic Church until the early 1960s one of the only places you could buy a beer in Ireland on st. Patrick's Day was the well attended Royal Dublin Dog Show commercial pressure led to the lifting of the ban in 1960 March 17 regs fourth on the list of busiest holidays in America this doesn't hear buzias yeah in America by New Year's Eve Christmas and the fourth of July the drinks of choice the world so people are gonna do what they want to do and I'm so thankful that we celebrated different a different occasion today right the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and you the believer in men praise the Lord how many believe he's alive he's alive and well amen so let's uh we're gonna read up here from Romans chapter 8 and we're just gonna have a responsive meaning here for just a moment and then huh then we'll get to a little little subject I was coming to I was gonna go a certain direction this morning but I didn't get time to get everything gathered together the way I wanted to so maybe at another time so I decided to go this route instead so let's uh let's read Romans chapter 8 and you're welcome to look here or vary your Bible for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also [Music] for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body but if we hope for that we see not then do we then do we with patience wait for it [Music] and he then searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God remove me therefore know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren I would say then what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies [Music] who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword nay in all these things we are more than conquerors praise God I always received comfort when I read those words yes that was one of my favorite scriptures because it gives us a hope so it confirms that hope that's already it should be lady and then I say man that none of these things no matter what takes place no matter what happens in our lives they can't separate us from the love of God they can't separate you from what God has already started in your in your in your soul is in right that's that's eternal right and if it's eternal that means it's an anchor that just can't be moved you see Satan would want to make you think that it's uh it's it's for for a short time got to take it away any moment God doesn't love you go but you see when when you have an anchor and you know whom you have believed that you Paul says I know who I have believed in this way and I'm persuade when you persuaded about something but nothing nothing can can keep that away from you I mean it can't take that away from right I mean I'm persuaded if that my wife is my wife nobody to take that away from me you can't tell me she's not your wife you can't tell me she's she doesn't she doesn't live in the house with you she doesn't sleep in the same bed that you sleep in keep me awake for about an hour to two hours last night I'm not fully there this morning because she stayed up let's not watch him brother waited in the Philippines so but at the same time I understand it's because it was the anniversary of the Royals meeting and that's the trishing roping before she came to America so it's very dear to her heart you know it's very special she wanted to watch it live and of course you know where the wait was they're ministering so hard I'll give it to her but it but it yeah I went to I went I went to bed late and then of course you know a few hours later you know she she was up side every now and then I'd wake up and not here by the way but anyways but you know thanks yeah I know I know that that's my wife that you can't persuade me any other way no you can't tell me I promise Christine is not my wife because I know that I know it I know that she is that's how we have to do that's how we have to see God in our lives amen that you know that you know that you know that he's your father and that you are him and he meant and that he is you praise God that he's in you amen that's how that's how we have to stand on the word in that way amen and so much that it makes us act upon the word when you stand upon something and when you really convinced on something you act upon that right right I know she's my wife and that's the reason why I do husband type things for her right because I know she's my wife but if she's not my wife I wouldn't do there are certain things I wouldn't do you see big finding if I knew for sure she wasn't my wife but I know for a fact that she's my wife and I'll do I'll act upon that you see so so there's uh that's how we have to sing God in our life thing man and in Saints you know as we were reading here just while ago the earth and that's what I was looking at I've been looking at a couple of a couple of days just kind of is kind of thinking how the earth was cursed because of men's of because of men's decision there in the Garden of Eden right you know Adam wasn't cursed it wasn't it was the earth that was cursed you see the ground and because of that curse thorns and thistles came about now those thorns and thistles were not there to kill the man right then you don't get killed by a thorn in a thistle right you don't you don't die if you get poked by a thorn in this one but those thorns that they hurt it hurts but those thorns and thistles were there to constantly keep a reminder to men that where they came from there their fallen condition they're in a falling condition and God had to come in in some way or another and remember when Christ was was crowned with a crown of thorns maybe he took all those thorns all that sin all that all that in other words I'm liberating everything even though even from from that amen is gonna liberate your your whole earth he sees and we're another brother Brendan preached to feature home and he talked about how how the earth is not going to be a one point in time cuz thorns and thistles weren't on the original creation thorns and thistles came about after man sent so it's so interesting how how he was crowned with a crown of thorns to let us know hey it's all on me it's all going back he's the head right and just thinking about that and how how god is you know those little things are in the scripture like that for a reason you know you think Oh crown of thorns is there to you know for pain and suffering but that had a symbol and Romans are there Romans are there doing what they were doing to Christ not knowing they were fulfilling bigger scriptures you know and things are set so it's amazing how God does things in the scripture and we could just take some time and pay attention to the certain details of the word amen just just think sometimes you know even brother brown says that sometimes as we're praying some as we're praying God just is one of the best times it up I'm getting I'll get like thoughts that just come to mind you know just I guess if you can say revelations you know I mean I've gotten sermons just out of print yes you know like wow yeah I didn't see that before why is because now Paul is Paula st. here sometimes you don't know what to pray about but it's it's the prayer that's groaning within you right just as that creep the creation and the creature is groaning we are groaning as well because we have a connection to this earth right they have a connection to the creature there's a good we have a connection to out of the dust we came and and right now the dust we will go that you know in the current simple state that our bodies are in right now but we have a connection with it but sometimes we don't know what we need to pray for right but he knows so if you get in the spirit as you pray all of a sudden just things start flowing and you don't even know you don't even know oh my goodness how do you even know that that was that was laying there but it's God and if God lays in you you know he's dwelling in me he'll give you he'll he'll let you know what you need sometimes we think we need something in reality we need something else that'll lead to the to - to the to the you know - to minister to that specific point that you think that you need we think that God made needs to do it as in this certain way you know but in reality God knows the exact to minister to that specific music yeah so we just appreciate the Lord amen amen so I'm gonna go here to Romans chapter 5 Romans chapter 5 and that's here in verse 1 it says therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope remember in the last spiritual we just talked about hope right there's that hope within us that we're not going to live you know in this pest house in this condition right and-and-and-and because we're we're groaning for that that means there a hat that has to be out there for us see otherwise our bodies wouldn't be calling for that remember our brother Graham talked about the little boy who was eating the petals off the bicycle because his body wasn't even sulfur and your body will tell you if you need a certain nutrient in your body it'll tell you you need this it'll start something will start coming out of your skin or something it'll tell you hey you need such a circus of such and such a nutrient or a deer and because if that new trip wasn't available if that new tune wasn't available it wouldn't be giving you that sign right but it because that nutrient is available for you or that thing is available for you think that's the reason why you're getting that time you think are you getting that smile the boy was even the petals off of the devices because he was needing sulfur so we have a hope we were desiring more than this than what we currently have right yes verse three and not only so but we glory in tribulations look out Paul says we glory in tribulations that's so that's that's that the hard thing isn't it sometimes we think tribulations is just you know what the martyrs went through when they were being ripped apart by horses and things like that but you know you can be going through a personal tribulation but Paul says he we glory in them not because there's a bigger picture there's a bigger picture we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope a hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly amen so you know sometimes Jesus he allows us you know to go through pain shame suffering because he knows what our expected end will be right he wouldn't give you something that you can't there he will allow for you to go through something that you're not gonna be able to go through what that would be unjust for him to do that right what an unjust got it they would be if he puts you through something that you can't that he knows himself you're not gonna be able to make it through but because you go through something a lot of us because he has so much confidence in you that you know that you that's what Jeremiah 29 gemenon 2011 says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you right says the Lord says thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end think of God is expected he knows what the outcome is gonna be to him it's not a surprise yes right to you and me it's a surprise yes oh my goodness but then yeah it's no surprise at all why because it's an expected end if he knowing the beginning from the end what would something that takes place in our life what would it take him by surprise it's right you see it doesn't doesn't doesn't do one thing he just knows he knows what's gonna what the outcome is gonna be and so he's smiling about it not knowing it's gonna be a good outcome about this right it's molding a character in my sons and my daughters its molding of patience its molding experience its molding a hope in them that they didn't have before right so so the events in your life you know they're they're expected by God the Colossians 3:3 says for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God that is in your life is so your life should be so hid in Christ with God in the anointing right with God the Satan can't even find it should be so that's how kid you are so something's happening in your life you're already getting Christ you're already hitting Christ Christ already Christ already has you covered you see when something's happening in your life and you know God has a vision for each and every one of us and he knows what it will take to get us to that place yeah amen he knows exactly what what you need you know when when I when a potter is working with with clay he is not he's not sitting there treating that clay all nice and all smooth and all you know this way I'm going to the base is gonna come out of just me you know kind of like rubbing a cat you know you know there's gonna be a vase to come out of this and he's in there that you think that base is gonna come out of him just sitting there doing that no we're a beautiful you know something nothing like that is gonna come out of a real Potter now yes right you know a real Potter a fake Potter maybe you know you it'll probably show you yeah I know how to do things I'll make a vase the base never comes out right but a true Potter he looks electro two-parter already has in his mind the end goal yes right and that's what's motivating him to do what he's doing and so he's taking water he's taking he takes mud at a mud and clay out of out of the ground and dumps it on the and starts it starts shaping this thing on this on the potter's a wheel and it starts going I mean he's he's come and he's moving and he's he's squeezing and he's he's using his hands why because he's a true Potter and he knows exactly what needs to happen in order to to mold that into what he already knows that it's gonna be there he knows what he's doing and the clay is probably funny he doing this to me not there no but that's where he needs you in order to build that beautiful little part that he that maybe that little side with the handle you know yeah he needs to do that right in order to build that little handle in your life right and so and so you know that's what I that's why I think is the scripture that says Kenda can the clay say to the Potter don't do this to me no they can't so what's the best thing for you to do is just to submit to him submit to what is going on in your life submit to what is happening because God is in full control you didn't take you by surprise right he knew her from the before the foundation of the world and so if he knows it from the foundation of the world why by why are we get we get so alone I understand we get alarmed and we did we did humanly speaking we do that's gonna happen right writers truth that's gonna happen but then we have to reflect and see the bigger picture I have to stop and say what's the bigger picture here and and and and ultimately if it's happening to you God is only concerned about fulfilling his word right and so if it's happening in your life God that means God is concerned about fulfilling his word in your life a minute so so pain amen I if I guess I could give this a title the purpose of pain in a Christians life because pain is part of that vision that God has that painting has to come yes right you know they say no pain no gain if you don't sacrifice anything in your life if there's no if you don't if you don't put it you know if we don't sometimes we need to let our children experience certain things in life so that it can understand what it means to be in that condition and I can come out of that you see but if we don't let our children experience anything bad in our lives and things like that they're never gonna grow up and learn and learn anything yeah we need to let them sometimes experience they're going through that in their life you pray for them you led them to a certain point but now God you have to do the rest I can't I can't be there you know sometimes Bella she's getting older and he's always getting older and I I can't be there 24/7 with him right right and they make mistakes and then they come back Bella sometimes I'll pick her up from school and she comes back baby crying and and I said what's in the best thing for you to do as a father as a parent just to listen to him just talk with them you know and just say what's going on and they'll start pouring their heart out to you and then you realize how you say something oh my gosh but to them it's really and to them it's a pain and then it's it's something then but because you should have more maturity to see it that way you know so because you're they're coming to you for help right now because they see you as a guide right we're there God until they get the Holy Ghost right yeah they come to you with with this with this pain in their life something that happened to them and they're in there and and and if you're if you know if you're not there to listen to them you know and to guide them scripturally you know they're gonna go off and listen look listen to somebody else or tell it to somebody else a friend or something something they want to be heard right now so pain but but in going back to that but sometimes they need in your mind you're thinking but you know what they need to go through that yeah they need to have experienced that because when they get to be alone on their own no you can't be there for them right every time so when they get to be the butter on their own so god it is molding us in that same way you think we think we're mature and we think we're we read and we are all Muslim you know the older ones here obviously they're more mature and I am and and some all of us are in different levels of maturity you think God knows better than them than we do and you might you might be a certain age but but and but God knows exactly what else you need in your life to get you to where he has envisioned before in the foundation and you can be you can be 75 80 you can be 50 you can be 21 it doesn't matter but if you're still here on this earth it means God's not done with you you still need to fulfill something in your life and you still need to grow all right we're still grown and it's like a story that I was reading about it there that was caught in a trap you know there that a hunter you know he's caught matrac the berries continent trapping a kind hunter he wants to go help free the bear and the bear is there wrapped in pain you know he's in pain but the the hunter all he wants to do is go and help him out but as he's trying to take the the trap off of him the bear thinks that he's trying to hurt him even north because he feels the pain even more and in that bear in the North you know and he's trying to take and so the hunters I the only thing I could do this tranquilize him you know so he takes the get the gun out you know the and the bear screams out even more you know but he the better is not realizing that all the hunting do is just the help all the hunter wants to do is to get them to an expected end right right and it's painful it's painful but as I always say problems have a beginning and they have an end they're not eternal God's eternal right yes problems have problems they're not eternal problems have a beginning so some Psalms 23 says time we got a couple more minutes some 23 says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want so the Lord is our Shepherd a sheep puts full confidence in his pastor in his Shepherd yes she that's what a sheep does yes I'm confident that as soon as I hear the voice of my shepherd I go to him and if he's dropped us off here to eat grass I'm confident that he knows what he's doing and if he's left he's walked over there and and he's not around I just keep my eyes on him as I'm eating but I'm confident that he knows what he's doing right amen so it's amazing how David said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want in other words there's nothing that I'm that I will lack in my life because he's my shepherd right he makes me to lie down in green pastures he makes me say he leads me he makes me to lie down in green pastures you know when you have that in your mind you're thinking peace you're thinking comfort you you're thinking rest right he leads me beside the still waters and then he restores my soul amen he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me not that you will be with me but you are with nothing and do I walk through the valley of the shadow of death thy rod and thy staff they comfort me Fowler prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies in other words before my enemies before my problems I'm still eating good as far as the spiritual you know I'm still enjoying the benefits of God even though these problems all surround me right none of these things can overtake me because I'm in the Shepherd's hands right right before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over in the midst of trials in the midst of problems in the shadow of the valley of death and your cup can run over that's what David's saying that's right right surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life even in those days where problems are just up to here when you're drowning in problems and issues surely surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days are now and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen praise the Lord I used to be a big comfort and I'll stab it in my mind you know what maybe me and Bob need to do that when we have to meet the new man what you gonna do then you have it 20 30 songs with me my wallet oh good what was what you use it for well but that was a that was an enemy in her life so it works for her right is how you take the wording man it would that's why I read one that's why we read the in Romans you know who shall separate us from the love of God yes nothing in this life we're in Christ nothing man so sometimes God allows us to make a fool of ourselves so that we can understand why this perfect will is for us yeah kind of like that you know one-way door mousetrap you know you know you think how do you think you got it all figured out you go right in it's wonderful in here all right stuff for me to get out it's not so easy now to get out isn't thought you knew you thought you had it all figured out how am I gonna get out of this Lord then the Lord allows for you to give through those one-way door Travis yeah not really a trap but it's a position as a place where he's trying to put you in to make you realize listen you don't know everything you need me I know everything God you don't you need me you're gonna put tight position right now let me open the door for you right and then you realize oh god I should've trusted you all along man but that's you know that's the permissive will versus His perfect will right guard allows he will allow you to go through things in life and to you know for you to you know for you to realize what okay in that position I know that he or she is going to come out knowing this realizing this that's why that's why you know I've had times where I've had to let villages okay go ahead you're right sometimes you know she like poppy in school such and such and such and I know in my mind and my wife with knows I know my mind it's not that way okay then the next day she goes it's cool yeah puppy yeah I wasn't that the way I thought saying you know I wanted you to realize it on your own that's the best way you know for people to learn lessons instead of you being on top of them all the time you know let's let them go through it on their own you know that's how my mom and dad did to me and look at the way I came out the Saints really my mom and my dad when we came to the states I was 7 years old my mom and dad did not a speak English then oh no all of my dad knew was just to go work and then to raise his family and my mom was working as well a lot of times me and my sisters we have to just fend for ourselves we have to learn English and not knowing any bit of English and we came to the United States I was 7 years old we were in the house we had to do chores around the house and I'm talking about me not just go clean your room I'm talking about we had to go in and watch and said watch the bathtub wash pots and pans and things like that because my mom and my dad they had a longer vision of things you see a bigger vision it wasn't just oh I don't want to do this to my child it was a bigger vision you see exactly by then going through those experiences they're gonna learn bigger things in life and be more responsible in life and out and and and become something in life you see and that's the same thing with God and you God's not feeling bad what you're going through right now he understands he has he has he's looking at the outcome he's not looking at what you're going through he's looking his up the out and so my mom and dad date the my mom she has no regrets that she made us do chores around the house and things like that you know I had to there's things that I just have to do that I just have to learn how to do but you know I'm in a new country grew up was born in a totally different country and come to the states not knowing anything there's things my mom and dad can help us with my mama that can help me with school then you know the English language I had to understand learning the in acts go and learn and see and learn how to ask my teacher can you help me with this because I don't know I don't understand you see so it's not bad for you to have to go through something in life you will understand later why right you realize this is why I had to go through that because I'm like I I now know this yeah God's taking me through steps every way men and uh oh my and just just to finish with this brother branham remember when he went hunting that one time when he was in on his honeymoon with with his with his wife and his Billy Paul remember that he said well I'm gonna be in the honeymoon so I'm gonna go hunting at the same time then he thought he said he refueling what he says he I thought I was a woodsman no hunter and he realized he was lost and it had to come to a point where like that he had to say Lord I'm lost can you help me because my wife and my child they're down there at the bottom of this mountain waiting for me I need to get back to them but God knew where he was at he just wanted him to know where he was at four hundred to a point where he needs to know where he's at and God said okay I can you out now right so that's that's the same thing with us that's the purpose of pain in our lives I hope you get something out of it and just just be prayerful just just continue believing God's promises for your life amen no matter what you're going through god bless
