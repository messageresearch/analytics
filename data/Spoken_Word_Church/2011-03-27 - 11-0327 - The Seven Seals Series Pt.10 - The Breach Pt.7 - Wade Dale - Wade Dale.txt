========================================

huh let's turn to the Book of Job chapter 19 and we're going to read something here we quoted a lot but we're going to read statement that job made about his flesh um like you're left-handed you always put that on your left side I have to why don't left either way I think that kind of people we have in this room listen for all of you on the internet you all have a right to be wrong right amen use the right side of our brain yeah the other left all right chapter 19. because in Revelations chapter five as we've said before we're going to read today this has to do with your flesh now job we know was not a born-again Christian but he can be a type of a born-again believer he was not a um when job was here standing in the Old Testament he was not fried but he can be as John and be as others type the bride in verse 23. oh that my words were now written or that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and lead in the rock forever where I know that my redeemer liveth personal and thank my wife for this talk this morning because she sparked a little something I want to get started with but we were talking about this coming up the road I know that my redeemer limits now I don't know that your redeemer lives right see how personal this is right this was personal to Joe all right so this Revelations 5 has got to be personal to you let's just be honest with ourselves we can set in a Congregation of 100 people today and the guy sitting beside of you or the gal sitting beside of you that's right and you'd never know it because this is the end time okay don't look over each other and make judgment okay because buy you fruits you'll be known and somewhere you're gonna I sit there by myself so I'm fine I just have to judge me that's right okay this is what job's saying but look for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth now not job the Redeemer okay Joe's dead okay at the latter day upon the Earth so what's he standing in Brian form all right so let's click our brain over to that Brian foreign and though after my skin worms destroyed this body people that have gone on and died yet in my flesh shall I see God there's your resurrection and change that job is looking for knowing that he could see the grass uh die and see the flowers die but look out here now the same place we saw snow two months ago there's a green stem going up with a big pretty flower on top of it where'd it come from okay from the Earth but it died and come back to life see every day it shows a resurrection every year shows the resurrection in the Earth potentially but job then said now I see man die and I see him no more he had a question is Mom where's he at brother right where's he going I haven't seen anything but when he said right here oh that my words were now written though they were printed in a book and though after my skin worms destroyed this body yet in my flesh shall I see God yeah we got to have that same testimony and we don't you know that those that are already going on the skin worms has already destroyed their body but that didn't bother Joe he said yeah in my flesh and I'll see him for myself now look whom I shall see for myself not we they are us right when I shall see for my whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another all right that to me is the opening of the seal just in a nutshell why the seventh seal is not going to be open to everybody it's going to be an individual affair with God if you have a body change right sure okay it's not because your wife's sister brother daddy mama papa believe this message you gotta have an experience with God you got to have a positive experience with God just like Joe was showing right here when I shall see for myself and mine eyes see this is where mine eyes where's the eyes eyes of understanding see the Bible says my eyes of understanding be open right right all right and not another it's not going to be a collector we're not going as a as a denomination Collective group that's right sure we are in this group of the Bride but it's made up of many members right individuals that's right make up this body though my Reigns be consumed Within Me In other words though this guy right here is going to be sticky to the change this guy right here was uh is still a huckleberry until the chains come but the inside Guy the one he's talking about right here though that my skin worms destroyed this body we know we're not getting another one he said yet in my flesh so what was he standing in he said though the skin worms destroyed my flesh in my flesh I'm gonna see God he had a revelation that he was going to take a change not a replacement right right okay so to me this is very important in this scripture right here people you know they they called it all the time but to me this shows Revelations 5 and 6. and eight the opening of the seals right here this is an individual affair with God you've got to believe that your flesh can be changed before it can be changed that's right now job had a partial understanding because job died but see it says here at the latter day will stand upon the earth now look catch this for I know that my redeemer liveth or are we talking about a kinsman redeemer in Revelations 5. he takes the book comes out of the church ages takes a book sets down on the throne all right becomes one on the throne we'll read that in a little while if we have time I'm taking up too much time now but this is very important for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth Jesus Christ the Redeemer himself his body will not stand on this Earth until after we change so what is this talking about that's right this is to me this is bride form he's in brine form right here because the only way Jesus Christ is going to ever stand on the earth at the latter day is in a group of people right and they've got to get a revelation that that's God in human flesh standing on the earth so Joe said it um thousand three thousand four thousand four thousand years ago more than that because this is 1500 BC going back the other direction you gotta go 1500 to get to zero and then go two thousand years for 3 500 years 3 500 years ago God came down and revealed to job in partial understanding not perfect he got partial understanding because he didn't take a chance but job said I know that my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms destroy this body he knew there was sin because what did he do he saw what happened when Satan got a hold of his kids and got a hold of his farm and that all went away and see job spent a lot of his time worrying that his children had what committed a sin right so he made sacrifices for him okay then they got to accusing job of doing something wrong well Joe knew there was something wrong it was his flesh that's why he said right here when he got that when that thing clicked and he said hey I know I can't do anything about it but this man this redeemer is going to take this body he's going to come in a body of Flesh die give his life change his body come back in a group of people and that's when death is going to be destroyed all right so in my flesh let's keep that in mind from now until we finish this thing up ever how many months or years it takes that's going to be my thing in My Flesh I shall figure in my flesh because he remember brother Brown he makes these little statements and everybody's like well that's just statements he makes he's a good Storyteller that's true but it was God telling us a story right he said this is my eye he said once it was God he said but God gave me this I announce mine and God's not going to take it back there's not an Indian giver he gives you the new birth and now whose New Birth is sure we know it's his we don't deny but who's is it in my flesh so let's remember that in Revelation 5 because all the things I've been telling you John was a born-again Christian for 60 years before he made it to Patmos excuse me and he's here crying because he needed a redeemer he was redeemed 60 years ago okay let's get one thing out of our head when we start reading this because a lot of people here in the in the breach they see that you know brother Brown says well the lamb comes from around the around the throne come out of the church ages takes the book sits down the throne redemption's over because remember it gets Smokey and all those things excuse me that means judgment so everybody is into the point of some of them say well redemption's over nobody else can be saved all our brother Brown's got to come back and tell you this your redemption's over let's just pull them both together yup Redemption is over and through brother Reynolds message Redemption though we're not a return minister okay so maybe looking at me kind of strange because when you become born again God can give you no more eternal life than he gave you the day you got it that's right that's right so your Redemption is over right for yourself that's right John's Redemption was over 60 years ago for his soul and potentially for his body because guess what though he's dead though my skin worms destroy my body in my flesh John's going to raise right up from what took him from what gave him the new birth that's what's going to Quicken Romans 8 Romans 8 says what let's read it Romans 8. no I didn't drink him eight where's eleven but the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you I believe Paul was reading job sometime before he wrote this because it's the same thing it's the same identical thing John remember Paul got Mo you said well it was the Holy Ghost people but John had Paul you got now confused call him Paul had to read the Old Testament to get the New Testament he didn't take something out of the air remember you can't add a word to God's word and you can't take a word away so Paul took the Old Testament and expounded on it I believe he read job where it says in my flesh I shall see God I know my redeemer liveth now let's listen to what Paul said in the New Testament version but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you right he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your soul I'm going to say that it says your mortal body mortal you're not Immortal yet but it's going to Quicken your mortal body by his spirit that do other than you Quicken your mortal body job said in my flesh now how can a dead man raise up and say in my flesh I shall see God something had to Quicken that body all right so in the book in This Book of Revelations chapter 5 God is showing you that somewhere he's going to make the ones that are dead because remember the Bible says he searched in heaven searched in Earth and under the Earth they look everywhere Revelations 5. the Bible just ties together more and more every day then verse 3 and no man in heaven Saints is going on nor in the Earth right now neither under the Earth dead was able to open the book neither to look their own but there was one that had been I just caught this there's only been one person that fulfilled verse three Jesus Christ had been in heaven I come from God I go to God right he was in the Earth that's right he got buried under the Earth and he's the only one that's able because what he do he came out of that grave Immortal now there's been a lot of people raised from the dead Lazarus was raised from the dead but he died more than he raised mortal right right Jesus Christ died mortal raised immortal life and immortality has been brought to life through the gospel right the only one the Old King quote the only one that has reached immortality which means one day he was Mortal the next day then more Immortal not Immortal Immortal okay everybody understand that you didn't have to die again he didn't have to die again he had eternal life but what changed his body what he had inside of it what he had inside of him he believed remember brother Ryan said he believed in one scripture I will not leave my soul in hell neither will I let my Holy One see corruption corruption says that 72 hours right so his body didn't see corruption he knew he would raise before that body began to rot he raised on one scripture how about me and you how about me and you believe in Revelations 8 11. if that spirit that dwells in you dwells in Jesus Christ it quit it raised him from the dead it'll Quicken your Immortal body so potentially if you're born again today potentially it doesn't matter what age you were in potentially you're already raised sitting in Heavenly places your Redemption is over but remember a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted you accepted the pardon that Jesus Christ saved your soul that's good but only in the end time could God ever come down and break open the seal and showed you that this body can be redeemed and is already redeemed you're already if you're in the process if you're a Christian and you're in a process your body is becoming subject to your soul look at what you don't do anymore like I said before this hand that used to that used to to carry a beer can around it's the same hand but God changed the desire inside of me so the desire inside of me says this hand's not going to do that anymore that's right the desire that I had to say those words that I said well I got the same mouth gets me in trouble still but but not like it used to okay it don't say the words there's something inside it's working its way out okay by your fruits you'll know the people all right so revelation's five let's let's read a little bit we got about 20 minutes let's start where we left off on page 76 I'm all right though this is our theme from now on a big old eye foreign and if you die and go by the grave so what that still applies because in your flesh you're going to see God if you're born again today absolutely your throne room is Smoky it is Judgment because who is the Judgment upon yourself so redemption's over for you everybody understand that yes but there's still a process we've accepted the pardon for our soul but we've not accepted the pardon for this outside God that's right because we got to believe that it was signed sealed and delivered by President Abraham Lincoln according to what you know brother Brown gave the story if that man see listen it's that man had accepted that pardon from Abraham Lincoln his body his spirit and his soul would have been redeemed right natural because he wouldn't have been killed see you know you said well that that's good because not important you know for your soul but think about it that man died in his flesh because he did not believe the pardon but if he would have believed a pardon he would have been redeemed because remember when you pardon somebody you restore them back to here you can't take that against him anymore a presidential pardon wants it sealed on a book their record is exonerated to go back to when they were born now how much more if a man can do that on the Earth a human mortal Man by the laws of the land he can do that what a mighty God can do that that's our problem people we just can't believe that God can do that now that's just the bare bone fact myself all the way back we can't believe this guy right here is God made manifest and he's already quick in this thing because we get older we do things wrong if we're pardon can we accept the pardon everything has been taken care of but we still got to go through the Journey of life they all got and listen if you come down to the end of the road and you and you you say well I don't think I got it well you fruits will show somewhere down the line see because job was definite he said at the last day this is all going to come together and happen in Revelation 5 that's what's happening everything's coming together the lamb is going to take the book God's going to sit on his throne or Jesus Christ is going to sit on his throne excuse me remember in Revelation 3 14 he keeps telling what the promises are our promise is that we get to sit with Jesus Christ who is immortal he's sitting on the throne in human flesh right now human flesh right that bodies guys not some extraterrestrial body and all that come out of this Earth it was the same body you went down in same body you ate and then preached in done all those things that same body resurrected in his standing right now interceding for us it's sitting on the throne he's sitting on a throne somewhere sure we know he's sitting on the throne of our heart but he literally is somewhere right the person of Jesus Christ if you can touch right brother Brown said he is a being he has a place to dwell he has a throne to sit on because Jesus would never said right here to him and overcome will I grant to sit with me in my Throne who's talking about Jesus Christ remember seeing red letters so Jesus is speaking that tonight 3 21. even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in history so down through the church ages he was sitting on the father's Throne which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Son of God Revelation that your soul can be redeemed but they've always been a separation between your soul and your body down to the church ages well this guy this is my soul this can be redeemed it's okay but this guy can't do anything there's nothing you do about this it's got to die then when this guy goes down with it and he goes to heaven this guy somehow is going to appear with a new body a flesh and there's nothing going to happen to this guy he has to lie the devil right because that's his job divide and conquer all right but see he tells you said hey you were born from your mama and you did all these things in your past life and you can't be this and you can't be that that's right sure there's things that you know that that if I go and commit adultery today I know I can't preach or I can't be a deacon you know that's things that we can't do as far but that doesn't mean that I can't have this this guy I can't walk around for eternity in this man that's right but it was mine it was my mind it was what I let myself do as a person okay I overrode because see God remember brother Brown said it's very interesting but we'll redo next week let's just talk about this for a minute brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is timid he'll go out on the limb you start doing stuff with things wrong he'll go out on a limb and then you have to ask him to come back well that doesn't mean that he takes eternal life out of your soul that just means that you have overcome you have you have took that timid Holy Spirit and you've pushed it down all right because it says grieve what's grieve do suppress if you're in grief what are you doing you're down you're you're you're you're way down and you think things are wrong you know all you just is greed not the holy spirit of God so brother Ron said it says they said greed not that means you can grieve it all right and that will mean that you'll have to die natural death I want us to be real about this you'll have to die natural death because of what you think of what the word says right right what you can accept all right I've made examples many times before but you got to look at it on the positive side your mother Sister Hazel um Margaret the ones that have gone on before God saw that that was the Pinnacle of their understanding which is a great thing right hey we think it's bad they don't hate their job anymore that's right they don't pay taxes anymore they're in a glorified condition not what not a you know body of flesh but they're in their theophany Eternal as they ever will be but they're not in their total right to be conditioned right because we got to get back in this guy because job said job didn't say in my extraterrestrial body Joe didn't say in my soul he said in my flesh My Flesh personal guy right I shall see God Sister Hazel came to a point where that's all the gods she could see and and God said okay I'm finished everybody brother random anybody that's gone on God has been if you're a Christian God's finished with him he saw before the foundation of the world they would come to a certain point and that's as far as they go remember the man that asked for 15 years we think man that's a great thing he should have went on right then got that next 15 years he got worse but God knew he would but see he asked for it and God gave it to him right okay so exactly Solomon he messed up in his into his you know life maybe it's not good I mean some of you get rocking towards 70 years old at 50 sometimes I feel a little rough yeah so you know it's not a bad thing if we pass on but there is going to be a group of people that's going to stand on the earth and it ain't going to be all kids I thought a long time ago that I mean back when I was 14 you know I knew about the body change and I knew you know we were going to church here and I knew I was listening I was reading I knew the problem was talking about getting a body change and then we were going to be maybe uh physically bereft and we were going to maybe be at the mercy of the elements so I thought man it's going to take some superhuman you know big Arnold Schwarzenegger looking thing to to make it and and then the thought came back to me well Samson was not an Arnold Schwarzenegger looking kid right he was a little ready little boy with seven little curls running down his head now we put them over in the funny farm now but God said that's my man why did the Philistines Chase spend their whole entire time trying to find out where he got his strength from if he was 6'8 and this big you know how to test this big and arms this big when he picked up a gate you just say man this guy's strong but when you got a little guy looking like Don Knotts or Barney Fife and he'd walk around like this with a seven long girl and he gets mad and he picks up a City Gate that weighs two and a half tons each that's five tons and he picks the things up and he walks up and sets them down on the hill they wanted to know where he got his strength from that was amazing to them why do you think they kept trying like I said if this guy walks out and he's you know looks like Mr Universe they think well he's just being strong but when a little ready guy goes out there look at David the Bible said he was pretty he was a nice looking guy but he's ready a little bit small stooped over kind of guy well maybe that's one is going to take the change of the body you know the guy that just continually walks with gun don't have to be you know the uh you don't have to look like the athlete that I thought everybody would have to look like and everybody have to be young to take a body change if you're young you don't need a body change foreign whatever it didn't matter job said I know that my redeemer lives and in my flesh I shall see God and I'll see him for myself in other words I'll have a revelation of who he is doesn't matter if anybody else does and that's what we've got to look at in it in that job 19 in my flesh I shall see God and not I might if you're born again so if anybody's asked you if anybody says what do you believe about Redemption I'll I'll tell them I'll say look my Redemption is over I can't speak for you I can't speak for all the bride but my Redemption is over I can't be no more redeemed than I am now I've just got to work this guy in a process right to get to it because this man right here if you've got the Holy Ghost today in your soul this man right here will see God in this flesh right there right that's right so we go back to the garden there's your Redemption Body Spirit and soul that's right even the ones that are going on Sister Hazel one day she'll just come right up them grapes are not going to have to open up because remember it's a secret going away I always thought you know when you're a kid you think boy you say welcome to Resurrection takes place you you see all these Graves popped open you know no no he said it would be a secret right so you can go out there sister Hazel's Graven it'd be just pretty with flowers all over it and the rocks will be over the top of it but that person inside there won't be there right she'll come right up connect with that body God will change her and she'll walk among us at 20 years old once you see in those pictures out there right okay no shame to that huh coach they get their body changed before we do anyway yeah but it's got to come from somebody that believes in here because we got to believe for them Paul says they without us cannot be made perfect okay well we didn't get any reading done today let's read one let's just read one before we go page 92. sit back down I didn't dismissed actually it's page 91 paragraph two 38. we're going to read this one paragraph paragraph 238 notice he was not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him to stand on the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel no Angelic being knew nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture an act that not an angel not nothing can do it and the lamb comes and takes you from the right hand of him they sat on the throne one more one more thing just turn over to 92 and we'll read backwards next time paragraph 244. now he was the title deed to Redemption he has it in his hand he's almost a lamb mediation is done now he has it in his hand remember it's been in the hand of God all the time but now it's in the hand of the Lamb who is the Lamb so now all right God of human flesh now watch the title deed of redemption of all creation all creation is in his hand and he comes to claim it back to for the human race human flesh when you say human it's flesh you can't be a human without having to flash that's right okay not claim it back to Angels claimed it back to the human now John was a human being standing on patland screaming how old in the world are we going to get this done he was born again in his soul not in his flesh right right which it was given for close let's go back claimed it back to the human which it was given for to make Sons and Daughters of God again bring them back to the Garden of Eden everything they lost the whole creation the trees the animals like everything else oh my how about that then we'll read the rest of it later on but read these I'm gonna leave them up there but read 76-98 because that's some good reading in there that we will I'm not going to promise you but we might get it ready next Sunday y'all have a good week
