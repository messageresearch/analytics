[0:06] all and we're talking about godliness
[0:08] and we've been talking on godliness for
[0:10] a couple of times and we are going to
[0:16] uh continue the thought
[0:19] because there's really
[0:23] not there's really not a
[0:26] quote that we can quote you and say well
[0:30] this is this is how to be
[0:34] Godly there's not
[0:36] a scripture except the whole Bible that
[0:40] tells you how to have
[0:42] godliness so to be like God is going to
[0:45] be that we we are
[0:49] now we are now to have a god
[0:54] Consciousness everybody getting that we
[0:56] have to have a god Consciousness when we
[0:58] did the things of the world
[1:00] we didn't have a god Consciousness now
[1:02] God might have been dwelling with us but
[1:04] we overrode that and did our own
[1:07] Consciousness we drank we smoked we run
[1:09] around we did all the things of the
[1:10] world because we had no God
[1:12] Consciousness now God maybe was dealing
[1:14] and he was guiding you through life
[1:17] especially you know if you're born again
[1:18] now you know for one thing that God was
[1:20] looking for you looking after you when
[1:22] you were born as a baby all right um
[1:26] actually preserved you before the
[1:27] foundation of the world you just didn't
[1:29] know it's what we're talking about last
[1:30] night the Bible
[1:32] study the condescending of God is Not So
[1:34] that God can understand himself
[1:39] better it's so that we can understand
[1:42] God he knows who he is and he also knows
[1:46] who we are and like I was saying you say
[1:49] well sometimes this is hard or that's
[1:50] hard or
[1:53] listen if there was a better way to
[1:55] understand God we would be in that way
[1:57] that's right we we there would be an
[1:59] understanding that we would you know if
[2:01] God said well the easiest way is for is
[2:04] for all of us to like the color blue
[2:07] well then we would allow all like the
[2:08] color blue I'm just making for an
[2:09] example but he didn't he made it to
[2:11] where we can understand God as he
[2:14] condescends toward man we're able to
[2:18] ascend toward
[2:21] him and you can't understand a
[2:23] supernatural god with
[2:26] natural thought it's not natural
[2:28] Temperance it's not natural knowledge
[2:30] it's not natural patience some people
[2:33] have part of these virtues and don't
[2:35] have the new birth they're just as
[2:37] sinful as sinner can be all right so you
[2:41] can't just say well that person's
[2:43] patient boy they must be a Christian no
[2:44] they ain't got one thing to do with it
[2:46] that's right we got to become a
[2:48] Christian
[2:50] first then when we see patience take
[2:52] over like we was talking about last
[2:55] night and like I said Wednesday night
[2:57] and I'm sorry if it hurts you feeling
[2:59] feelings but how you going to overcome
[3:01] sitting at home right you cannot
[3:04] overcome sitting at
[3:07] home and the Bible says to the Overcomer
[3:11] that's right will I give these things
[3:13] you got to have something to overcome if
[3:15] this was just so easy and we can come to
[3:16] church when we wanted to and we can
[3:18] study when we want to and we can do what
[3:21] then you know then God is a grand dead
[3:24] just lets us get by with everything but
[3:25] he's not he's a father he said look this
[3:27] is the formula you got to go by and if
[3:29] you don't like
[3:30] you must not be one of mine that's
[3:34] right backl to lost one of the two we
[3:37] got to come down to where you see that
[3:39] it's honing people down here you see
[3:41] Faith it's big wi it's it's something
[3:44] that you have to establish everything
[3:45] you have on
[3:47] faith right everything you have has to
[3:50] be established on faith that's right now
[3:52] virtu is a little more narrow knowledge
[3:53] and Temperance and patience and
[3:55] godliness sister Johnny and I were
[3:57] talking briefly about brotherly kindness
[3:59] that's going to be the worst
[4:02] one for us right right for us it's going
[4:06] to be the worst one cuz that means you
[4:08] got to love that guy
[4:10] that done something to you and you got
[4:13] to love him as much as you love
[4:15] yourself that's going to be tough and
[4:18] you got to really mean it not just say
[4:20] oh well I you know I forgive them or or
[4:23] you know you always hear this one and
[4:24] it's okay to say well you were forgiven
[4:26] before you asked but still you got to
[4:29] ask ask you understand what I'm saying
[4:31] you said I asked a man yesterday we were
[4:35] buying some or we were swapping some be
[4:37] equipment stuff and he gave me a hive
[4:39] and and I told him I apologize for
[4:41] something you know for that if nothing
[4:43] if it wasn't right what we swapped out
[4:45] he said I'll use forgiven before you got
[4:47] here and that's
[4:49] okay but you can't just use as a cough
[4:51] out and then saying yourself say well
[4:53] I'm going to be forgiven anyway so why
[4:55] no no you got to ask
[4:57] forgiveness it's a conf of the mouth
[5:01] it's like sister John and I were talking
[5:04] really God don't care what you put
[5:08] in think about that God don't care what
[5:11] you put in that's right he never has
[5:14] said that he said what proceedeth out
[5:17] right of the mouth that's right right in
[5:20] the scripture what proceedeth out he
[5:22] said it's not what it goes out in the
[5:23] draw and all that he said what's
[5:24] proceeding from your
[5:26] mouth of course it's going to proceed
[5:28] from what's in what you feed it but God
[5:32] God wants us to display it not just what
[5:35] would it be if we just had it all and
[5:37] then went and went into a cave and and
[5:40] lived a Hermit life that's not what God
[5:43] wants he wants us to display that's what
[5:46] this statue of a perfect man is it's God
[5:47] on display to the people the only God
[5:49] they're ever going to see is when we
[5:51] live that statue of a perfect
[5:53] man so really it's not it's not because
[5:56] you can take in what about the guy that
[5:58] can quote the whole Bible
[6:00] right he may not even be born again if
[6:01] he's not born again he sure ain't got
[6:03] another virtues so it's not what you
[6:05] take in you see what I'm saying I mean
[6:06] you some of you look a little puzzled
[6:08] but you can memorize the message right
[6:11] you can memorize every quote but unless
[6:14] it comes out right in your own
[6:16] Revelation and it can't be contrary to
[6:19] what goes in either that's right got to
[6:21] be the
[6:22] same but like I said last night it does
[6:25] it have to be every single a quote B
[6:30] like that quote right there do we have
[6:32] to read it every
[6:35] no we read quotes and then we expound on
[6:38] it that's
[6:39] right and it's not that we fill in the
[6:41] blanks I've heard people say fill in the
[6:43] blanks no you don't fill in the blanks
[6:44] brother that leav any blanks we read
[6:47] between the
[6:48] lines we know what he was saying and
[6:51] we're expounding on that the word is all
[6:54] important the word created all of this
[6:57] and and like you said we take
[7:00] in the holy spirit will dig that and
[7:03] throw it out and the word that comes out
[7:06] the word we speak is going to change our
[7:08] body that's right your your your body
[7:11] change will not come from one creature
[7:13] speaking and your body change that's not
[7:16] that way anymore brother Brown said it's
[7:18] an individual affair with God is what
[7:19] comes from the inside now what you got
[7:21] on the inside is going to change you one
[7:23] way or the
[7:24] other but you chain started at a new
[7:27] birth cuz it was an inward work we all
[7:30] maybe look the same but we begin as we
[7:33] were talking about last night um and
[7:37] maybe you don't understand this so let
[7:39] me explain it to you there's casting out
[7:42] of
[7:43] devils and then there's that devil that
[7:46] resides in your
[7:48] soul that nature that you're giving at
[7:50] Birth to me that's too different it's
[7:53] not too different devils but it's two
[7:54] different manifestations that's true
[7:57] because you can you can somebody can
[7:59] have a a ling Spirit on them or let's
[8:02] say that one that brother Bram did about
[8:04] the
[8:05] woman that she was in the insane asylum
[8:08] and and they went and went to all the
[8:10] places and she couldn't find rest and
[8:13] brother Brandon by the discernment of
[8:14] the Holy Spirit brought something out in
[8:16] her life that she had done 20 years ago
[8:21] and that was so deep down inside of her
[8:23] well see that was a devil on her right
[8:25] it was a demon well see he cast that
[8:28] thing off of of her and then she went on
[8:31] to confess and live a normal life
[8:33] Christian she he said Christian okay so
[8:36] that was a demon that could be cast out
[8:38] just like that but now in this walk of
[8:41] justification sanctification baptism of
[8:42] the Holy Ghost I was thinking about last
[8:43] night when we were talking about that it
[8:46] says the unclean Spirit goes out of a
[8:48] man it didn't say the unclean spirit is
[8:50] cast out of the man now we know it's
[8:52] being cast out by the word but it can be
[8:54] doing it can be doing in stages
[8:56] gradually right everybody understand
[8:58] that because your walk in sanctification
[9:00] is is I got either if I'm smoking then I
[9:05] I can either do like God did me and he
[9:06] just said that's it you don't have to
[9:08] worry about it no more and I the next
[9:10] day I didn't want anymore the
[9:12] tobacco but some people can kind of go
[9:14] through sanctification and that unclean
[9:16] Spirit can go out in stages that's right
[9:19] anybody understand what I'm saying so so
[9:21] what I'm saying the new birth is
[9:22] different than being possessed by a
[9:23] demon you can be possessed by a demon
[9:26] and have a demon of whatever you want to
[9:27] call it that's
[9:29] and that can be cast out right by prayer
[9:32] in the name of Jesus Christ that can be
[9:34] cast out
[9:35] yes on that sister she was a Sunday
[9:39] school teacher that's correct and
[9:40] brother had prayed for her mhm and that
[9:44] he that's right until he had a
[9:46] discernment on her cuz he she held it
[9:49] inside of her exactly so even brother
[9:51] praying for you and you don't confess
[9:53] right that's right so that put what I'm
[9:56] saying you understand what I'm saying
[9:57] though casting out of devil is something
[10:00] that could be
[10:01] instantaneous you can have that thing
[10:03] cast off of you and you know in an
[10:05] instant but now in the Walk of a
[10:07] Christian Life it could take a year it
[10:11] could take 6 months it that's why I said
[10:13] don't worry about it but you I'd worry
[10:15] about it if it was 5 years but I don't
[10:17] know where your mark is but you know my
[10:20] Mark I guess I want it instantaneous I
[10:22] want it I wanton instantly godone but
[10:24] God has to work on that and then like
[10:26] somebody I think was Susan or somebody
[10:28] said you look back and
[10:29] go well I don't do that no more sister
[10:32] John said some of the things that used
[10:33] to bother me he said she said wasn't it
[10:35] just like it bothered me and then it was
[10:37] gone it was like you go through a
[10:39] process and then one day God will have
[10:41] somebody cut you off on the road or
[10:42] something and that old thing won't rise
[10:44] up anymore and you
[10:46] go it's
[10:48] gone we see it just it went
[10:52] out of the person it it left because of
[10:56] the word that you took in the more word
[10:59] words you pack in he's got to leave
[11:01] because that devil I don't care what you
[11:02] want to call him he hates a word oh yeah
[11:06] he hates the truth of the word he hates
[11:09] the truth of the word he doesn't mind
[11:10] the word cuz it's what you take in but
[11:12] when you try to when you put it out and
[11:15] God comes into you it's like I was
[11:17] saying Wednesday night and I love those
[11:19] quotes on on my guide is you do these
[11:22] things you do these things and then it's
[11:25] the God's responsibility to take you the
[11:28] rest of the way that's right amen it's
[11:30] like me and Donnie we had to get to
[11:32] Texas to meet the guide and then the GU
[11:35] did his job right you know so we had
[11:37] something that we had to do we had to
[11:38] walk through justification
[11:39] sanctification into the baptism of the
[11:41] Holy Ghost and then that guide began to
[11:43] lead us and guide us into all truth sure
[11:46] he was leading us and guiding us into
[11:47] all truth when we said God forgive my
[11:49] soul
[11:50] but but you weren't fully in the body
[11:53] you weren't fully up to where you can
[11:55] grow up in a stature not a statue that's
[11:59] right it's a stature it's height
[12:01] development growth development but
[12:03] that's what we're trying to get over
[12:04] Wednesday night
[12:07] is we preach in this church a journey
[12:10] that's right most people just preach
[12:12] that it's just beli in the prophet's
[12:13] message and I've heard them out of their
[12:15] own mouth their own mouth well it's
[12:18] believ in the message of the hour that's
[12:21] right well you know the devil believes
[12:24] part of it at least some he had to see
[12:27] the manifestation of it
[12:29] and I hope he sees the manifestation of
[12:31] it now it's what makes him
[12:33] mad okay so so he's he's right here
[12:37] that's right it's the two spirits in the
[12:39] framework of the
[12:40] church message church right not out
[12:43] there in
[12:47] here and what's going to discern that
[12:49] guide that guide's going to discern
[12:50] which way we go but now we can override
[12:53] that remember like I said we can greet
[12:55] the Holy Spirit we cannot go up the
[12:57] statute of perfect man as far as we we
[13:00] allow that to work that's
[13:03] right Hey listen when God said you are
[13:05] Gods Heen it that's right and brother
[13:08] rown said you're a little God it doesn't
[13:09] matter if you're he said you're a born a
[13:11] Son of God whether you're whether you're
[13:13] not born again whether you born again or
[13:14] not cuz you come from and had the
[13:17] characteristics of God that's right what
[13:19] that you do but over time that nature
[13:23] that you're born under it erodes and it
[13:25] covers and like brother Brown said it
[13:27] blackens that Soul it blackens all that
[13:29] out and you're a devil I mean you're
[13:32] letting the devil take over then the
[13:34] Holy Ghost comes in with fire burns that
[13:36] burns that old nature
[13:38] out and puts his nature in that's right
[13:41] now that's at a new birth but now
[13:43] sanctification and all that they go out
[13:45] the little things that we do go out at
[13:47] at different times that's
[13:50] right and remember even when you're born
[13:53] again you're still going to have trouble
[13:55] that's
[13:56] right but like I said before if if if
[13:59] you're if if you go to church less now
[14:02] than you did when you first got born
[14:04] again or thought that you got born again
[14:06] maybe you didn't get born
[14:09] again that's what the Bible says and
[14:13] much more as a day approaches and then
[14:14] we get you know you look around and you
[14:16] see people not here so you wonder what
[14:19] uh what's leading and guiding them I'm
[14:22] tell you something the devil's real amen
[14:25] and he's right here amen he ain't
[14:27] somewhere else that's right if he can
[14:28] defeat us he's got it whooped but all
[14:32] those promises that we read there in
[14:34] Psalms how God was going to restore
[14:37] right well he's going to restore he's
[14:39] going to restore a bride he promised he
[14:41] would so somebody's going to do it and
[14:43] we have to decide whether we're in
[14:44] thaten we're in that camp or not all
[14:47] right I ain't talking about a man's Camp
[14:48] either that's right let's read second
[14:50] Peter and
[14:52] U speak just a minute Simon Peter
[14:55] servant Apostle Jesus Christ to them
[14:56] that have obtained
[14:59] obtained they went out and got it
[15:01] kingdom of God is taken by force you got
[15:03] to remember that this thing's got to be
[15:05] taken by force
[15:07] right you know Bob did a wonderful job
[15:09] of
[15:10] that obtain like Precious Faith with us
[15:13] through the righteousness of God and our
[15:15] Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[15:17] multiplied unto you through the
[15:18] knowledge of God and Jesus our lord
[15:20] according as his divine power ha given
[15:23] unto us all things that pertains unto
[15:25] life that's what we're talking about now
[15:26] and
[15:27] godliness there knowledge of him that
[15:29] has called us to glory and virtue
[15:30] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[15:32] great and precious promises that by
[15:34] these you might be partakers of the
[15:36] divine nature having escaped the
[15:38] corruption that is in the world through
[15:40] lust and besides this in other words
[15:43] besides your new birth Ain that what he
[15:45] saying cuz that's how much a new birth
[15:47] from verse 1 through 4 and beside
[15:50] this giving all diligence add to your
[15:54] faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to
[15:56] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[15:58] and patience godliness and godliness
[16:01] brotherly kindness and brother kindness
[16:03] charity for if these things be in you
[16:05] and abound they make you that you shall
[16:06] neither be bar nor un fruitful in the
[16:08] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[16:11] other words that gives you that God
[16:13] Consciousness it gives you that cuz
[16:16] remember let me State
[16:18] this
[16:21] um I guess
[16:23] lightly there's only a few people have
[16:26] ever
[16:27] reached
[16:29] right there at brotherly
[16:31] kindness only a few people in this
[16:35] world from the day of Pentecostal
[16:38] now from the day of Pentecostal now
[16:41] there's only been a few I'm talking
[16:42] about a few people have attained to that
[16:46] brotherly kindness right there where it
[16:48] says cuz that's the faith of the
[16:50] fathers right right now the 120 in the
[16:53] upper room had it but the 3,000
[16:54] downstairs didn't I don't know how many
[16:56] of them grew into it but it couldn't
[16:57] have been many
[16:59] because after that happened it started
[17:01] eroding back down the other way right
[17:03] right so it didn't go up it went back
[17:07] down amen the first three Ages were okay
[17:09] but after that after the dogmas and all
[17:12] from n and all that took over it started
[17:15] eroding the word of God and nobody even
[17:17] reached hardly you know look at Columbus
[17:20] age brother said all they had was a
[17:22] confession that they were Jesus Christ
[17:26] that they believed in Jesus Christ and
[17:28] they were saved and they were killed
[17:29] that's all they didn't have virtue
[17:31] knowledge temper patience God and
[17:32] brotherly kindness they just got in the
[17:35] body they just got in the body squeezed
[17:38] in and then they were
[17:40] killed so they didn't have that
[17:42] manifestation of all the word then you
[17:45] look at Martin Luther like I was telling
[17:49] um s over here Martin Luther had one
[17:52] little slot that's right that was the
[17:55] just shall live by
[17:57] faith and it wasn't that God didn't care
[18:00] that he didn't go up the statue of
[18:01] perfect man he started building again I
[18:04] will restore with that the just shall
[18:07] live
[18:08] by faith right there
[18:11] Foundation then Wesley come through and
[18:14] he didn't get the full word he got part
[18:17] word so he could part talk about virtue
[18:20] part talk about knowledge Temperance
[18:21] patience godliness and brotherly
[18:23] kindness okay right part of it but still
[18:26] he was a trinitarian still he baptized
[18:28] name Father Son and Holy Ghost so he
[18:30] wasn't he wasn't all the total of the
[18:34] positive right right all right so
[18:36] there's Wesley then the Pentecostals
[18:38] come along and they receive the baptism
[18:41] of the Holy Ghost and brother R said
[18:42] they cabbage down on that so they stayed
[18:44] down
[18:46] here if they had had some Holy Ghost
[18:48] knowledge they wouldn't cabbage down on
[18:51] it sure they had a little piece of it
[18:54] everybody gets a little bit of it at the
[18:56] new birth you get a little piece of all
[18:58] this cuz you know what you better act
[19:00] like that when even when you're born
[19:02] again try to act Godly anyway you know I
[19:04] mean you got God in you so you must have
[19:06] to have some kind of characteristic of
[19:08] God that's right right so don't just say
[19:11] well I'm born again now I need godliness
[19:13] well you're born again with a little bit
[19:15] of godliness but that's the fullness of
[19:18] godliness that's when you act then
[19:20] that's when you're like I said your
[19:22] whole and listen don't get me wrong it's
[19:24] not our whole being we still have to
[19:26] work we still have to live we still have
[19:28] problems at home children parents
[19:31] grandparents I mean you still got all
[19:33] that to deal with that's true but
[19:35] godliness is a god consciousness of I
[19:38] used to raise up and do that now I don't
[19:41] anymore I used to to me like I told you
[19:44] before godliness looks down through
[19:46] patience Temperance knowledge back down
[19:48] to your new birth that's right see
[19:51] godliness looks right down through here
[19:54] right and check to me it checked you up
[19:56] that's right cuz see this is going going
[19:58] to check you up on every bit of them
[19:59] that's right cuz remember you don't just
[20:01] get virtue and then put the book over
[20:03] here virtue you don't just put the book
[20:05] over there and say well I'm done that's
[20:07] right now you don't graduate right from
[20:10] from virtue virtue grade to knowledge
[20:13] grade you know you don't get a deploma
[20:15] you get your diploma right
[20:17] here when you get a body change that God
[20:20] robes you in that whatever they call
[20:22] that thing that you wear with the icky
[20:25] on your head you know your uh graduation
[20:27] Ro but that's up here that's not down
[20:30] here sure you birth into the body but
[20:33] God wants somebody to manifest
[20:36] him and he's been looking for it all
[20:38] down through
[20:40] time since he gave the new birth of that
[20:42] 120 in the upper room which were birthed
[20:44] right here they had all
[20:46] this look at Peter and Paul like I was
[20:49] saying Wednesday night look at Peter and
[20:51] Paul a little confrontation well you
[20:53] know what Peter could have had no
[20:55] brotherly kindness and he said well
[20:56] bless God Paul ain't not he my
[20:59] pastor yeah that's easy for people to
[21:01] say now I ain't my pastor I Ain got to
[21:03] listen to but Peter I'm sure Peter said
[21:07] Paul you're right I'm sorry forgive me
[21:10] probably asked his whole congregation
[21:12] said forgive me sure it's not written
[21:14] there but you know what they went on
[21:15] they were brothers they had brotherly
[21:17] kindness they didn't separate that's
[21:20] right that's why a prophet had come
[21:24] right to restore all the word yeah put
[21:28] all this back together none of them had
[21:30] the word that we thought no people think
[21:33] that brother B come to tell us have
[21:36] dress whatever whatever get and the
[21:40] Pentecost done that not all that stff
[21:44] that's right so brother Bram come to
[21:46] restore the word that's the only reason
[21:48] God s why other reason did he send it
[21:51] the poor thing went through all kind of
[21:53] situations and whatever yep he didn't
[21:56] just send him just to be s and then he
[21:58] sent to restore all that
[22:01] word and it was God restoring the word
[22:04] but he was showing it through a man that
[22:06] could live it that's right a man that
[22:08] could live it and He restored it and
[22:12] there it was so we can look at our
[22:15] example and and and watch this there
[22:19] wasn't many
[22:20] people that made it to he very small
[22:24] amount right
[22:26] mhm
[22:29] why is that not supported by iPad put on
[22:31] here this is hard but there's not many
[22:34] people that made it here now look
[22:36] there's only a couple people made it to
[22:38] he
[22:39] yes Jesus Christ and brother Brown amen
[22:42] that we that we know that did in the
[22:44] past right now we got people now that
[22:47] that is coming to this cuz that's
[22:49] required that's a requirement for The
[22:51] Headstone to be put over and kept the
[22:55] people off so we know that that's very
[22:58] very narrow and there's
[22:59] only small amount of people but you know
[23:02] what you can say Well it can't be me
[23:04] well then you then it won't that's right
[23:07] then it won't be you if you say well I
[23:09] can't do it then then you won't that's
[23:11] right what's Brother D going to start
[23:12] preaching on positive
[23:13] attitude and this ain't a this ain't a
[23:16] Feelgood I hope he gets into this is not
[23:19] uh um what is that Christian Science
[23:22] where you know good thoughts mean good
[23:24] things and bad thoughts mean bad things
[23:26] no it's it's not one
[23:28] them but brother BR said a positive
[23:32] mental attitude toward the word of God
[23:34] will bring that to pass a positive
[23:37] mental attitude toward the word now if
[23:39] we don't live the
[23:41] word does he have to do that no he
[23:44] doesn't but if we live the word the best
[23:47] we can he will come to those promises
[23:50] and he will give them to
[23:52] us let me read this in first Timothy
[23:55] that Divine love there the two that had
[23:58] full
[24:00] right which was not just hair and dress
[24:04] and honestly all that should went out
[24:07] right down here that's right before
[24:11] Faith Comes the brother said you can't
[24:13] get a holy ghost filled woman put on a
[24:15] pair of pants or cut her hair then
[24:17] that's down here that ain't even we
[24:19] ain't even talking about that up here
[24:20] right we past that that's why I said
[24:22] Wednesday night we've been wasting time
[24:25] on do's and don't get on to this right
[24:27] here and all them do CU see
[24:29] sanctification is right down here that's
[24:31] right right right sanctification is down
[24:33] here before you even get that when you
[24:35] get that right there that's the faith of
[24:37] God that's not your faith that's right
[24:39] that's the faith of almighty God Amen
[24:40] and you won't do those
[24:42] things so what are we into now
[24:45] everybody's preaching well we got to be
[24:46] up here up here up here here that's
[24:49] okay but how you get
[24:51] there first you got to start down here
[24:54] cuz you can't preach you don't you don't
[24:56] need to preach hair and Dr dress
[24:58] anywhere in here you're wasting time
[25:01] that's right and I know there's people
[25:03] come to in it you got to preach it to
[25:05] but
[25:06] still there's a time when you got to say
[25:09] okay if you're still cutting your hair
[25:10] you're
[25:11] lost come to the altar get born again
[25:13] right don't sit in the church and say
[25:15] amen and Hallelujah and all that just
[25:16] forget
[25:18] it but right here is taking that man
[25:22] Christ Jesus and making him live in you
[25:26] without controversy great is the mystery
[25:28] of godliness so it's a
[25:30] mystery why is it a mystery cuz you're
[25:33] living it in the
[25:34] world don't know it right that's true
[25:38] God was manifest In the Flesh justified
[25:40] in the spirit seen of angels preached
[25:42] unto the Gentiles believed on in the
[25:44] world received up in the glory then 1
[25:47] Timothy 4:6 says if thou put the
[25:49] brethren in remembrance of these things
[25:50] Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus
[25:52] Christ nourished up in the words of
[25:54] faith and of good Doctrine where un to
[25:58] thou Hast attained but refuse profane
[26:01] and old wives fables and exercise
[26:04] thyself rather unto godliness which is
[26:06] of god Consciousness for bodly exercise
[26:09] profited little but godliness is
[26:10] profitable unto all things all
[26:14] things having promise of the life that
[26:16] now is and of that which is to come so
[26:19] in other words he's not just going to
[26:21] see that's the problem with a lot of
[26:22] people even in the message well when we
[26:24] get over there or when brother brandom
[26:26] comes or when the Holy Ghost finally
[26:28] come we're going to get to be living
[26:31] right right here the Bible says God is
[26:34] profitable to All Things having promise
[26:37] of the life that now
[26:39] is and that of which is to come so it's
[26:42] the promise of now that's right and that
[26:44] which is to come see to me it's just a
[26:47] cop out for people to say Well when
[26:49] brother Brown comes back to me that's
[26:50] lazy people that's right that's lazy
[26:53] people that says brother R's going to
[26:55] come back and he's going to tell me all
[26:56] these things and he's going to give me
[26:58] he ain't Jesus
[26:59] Christ Jesus Christ he said was here so
[27:03] brother Brown must have took him with
[27:05] him and we don't got nothing no I don't
[27:08] believe that that's right I believe the
[27:11] only way brother R's going to get out of
[27:12] the Grave is because we believe all what
[27:13] he
[27:15] preaches and get a revelation now listen
[27:18] to what Timothy or what Paul summed this
[27:20] up in Timothy 1 Timothy 4:9 this is a
[27:23] faithful saying and worthy of all
[27:26] acceptation
[27:30] he sums it up I mean Paul's pretty you
[27:32] know you think I'm blunt but you ought
[27:34] to read Paul sometimes this is a
[27:36] faithful saying and worthy of all that
[27:38] acceptation so whatever he said above
[27:41] that which was what I just told
[27:43] you you need to accept it and it's
[27:46] faithful because it happens now and it
[27:48] happens then all right same way with
[27:51] here but now look 2 Timothy 3:5 brings
[27:54] it over and saying having a form of
[27:57] godliness
[27:58] but denying the power thou of from such
[28:00] turn away so there's people that's going
[28:03] to be so close to
[28:06] Godliness but deny the power thereof
[28:09] like brother Dale was talking about the
[28:11] you know people that are that's going to
[28:13] have great
[28:14] manifestations uh you hear that Jeff
[28:16] Jenkins and and actually they took it
[28:18] off you see they took number one off
[28:20] number one he was like boy this brother
[28:22] over in South America South Africa he
[28:25] eclipses brother brandham and signs and
[28:27] wonders well that's the biggest lie that
[28:28] ever was told on the face of this Earth
[28:30] there's nobody a clip brother Bram in
[28:32] signs and wonders except Jesus Christ
[28:34] and brother brand said he had more Jesus
[28:35] Christ had that's right so forget that
[28:38] baloney so whoever the man is over there
[28:41] if he ain't if he ain't born again it's
[28:42] just signs of
[28:45] Wonders I'm sorry but they took that
[28:48] first video off you know that didn't I
[28:51] still got it cuz Joe sent me that link
[28:52] so I keep I keep it on my
[28:54] link but you see a man that's untaught
[28:57] and unskillful that what first thing
[28:59] they
[29:00] do they get defensive right start
[29:03] fighting things and that's what he's
[29:05] doing that's what that man's doing he's
[29:06] fighting stuff he's fighting things he's
[29:08] heard all the junk in the message and
[29:11] and you know thank God we still preach
[29:12] justification sanctification baptism of
[29:14] the Holy Ghost and we preach a
[29:17] furtherment of the Holy Ghost that after
[29:19] you get it we
[29:20] preach that the God's going to take you
[29:22] on through amen and we got to go up the
[29:25] statute of a perfect man it's not just
[29:26] something it's brother brand wasted you
[29:29] know a sermon on tape no it's a
[29:31] requirement something where we you know
[29:34] what it's something that no other age
[29:35] has been able to do except this age
[29:38] right that's true Jesus did it in his
[29:40] time cuz he was almighty God he was The
[29:43] Headstone amen so he was the first fruit
[29:46] see everybody says brother R was the
[29:48] first fruit no Jesus was the first fruit
[29:49] he was the first one to come brother
[29:51] brandom was the next one to come and we
[29:54] have to follow his message that's right
[29:57] right which is the message of The
[29:58] Headstone amen it's not a message of
[30:00] William Bram over here and Jesus Christ
[30:02] over here that's right it's Jesus Christ
[30:04] head of all things that's right and then
[30:06] brother brandom's here he got drawn up
[30:08] into it right opening of the seals and
[30:11] all those things and bringing the
[30:12] message so that we could come up cuz
[30:15] remember the sheath wave was the first
[30:17] one to come to maturity the first head
[30:18] that come out in that whole field the
[30:20] priest walked through that whole field
[30:22] every day and the first sheath that
[30:24] popped open he would gather a bunch of
[30:27] it and he would wave it over the field
[30:30] well that field wasn't mature yet it was
[30:32] just those ones that he had in his hand
[30:35] right so you got Jesus Christ brother BR
[30:37] being an an example for us and yeah that
[30:40] was waved over us cuz we were all little
[30:42] bitty plants that were trying to come to
[30:44] maturity so there's a way if you say
[30:47] well a man with a seventh grade
[30:48] education if he can attain to it then so
[30:50] can we cuz seventh grade education
[30:52] doesn't matter to me whether he was
[30:55] educated with a PhD or if he had third
[30:57] grade education Peter done pretty good
[30:59] and couldn't even write his
[31:01] name what I see with the statute of prop
[31:04] man is the faith is our foundation God's
[31:07] Building us building a mansion those are
[31:10] all levels of the Mansion right well
[31:12] those actually that's your building
[31:15] right that's what you're going to live
[31:16] in in the future home right there that's
[31:18] your building it's the stature of a
[31:20] perfect man that's the building that
[31:22] you're going to live on
[31:24] so I mean that's just the way it's going
[31:26] to be that you're building your future
[31:28] home right now Jesus said I go away to
[31:31] prepare place but I'll come unto you
[31:34] what do you do he brought the building
[31:36] on the day of Pentecost he started with
[31:38] the faith on bottom of the pyramid bir
[31:41] 120 through that statute were perfect
[31:43] man then he continued on with you and I
[31:46] so all right let's go I can see why the
[31:49] perfect word had to go down early in the
[31:51] church sure had
[31:53] be sure see they didn't have all the
[31:56] wording Harvest Right the seals weren't
[31:59] open
