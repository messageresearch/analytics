[9:50] 5 amen praise the
[9:53] Lord we're going to read in the three
[9:56] books Revelation Peter and Hebrew
[9:59] praise God it start in chapter 5: 8 to
[10:03] 10 and when he had taken the book The
[10:06] Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell
[10:09] down before the lamb having every one of
[10:12] them Harps and golden bals full of odors
[10:15] which are the prayers of saints and they
[10:18] sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy
[10:20] to take the book and to open the seals
[10:23] thereof for thou was slain and has
[10:26] redeemed us to God by the blood out of
[10:30] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[10:33] nation and has made us unto our God
[10:36] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[10:40] the earth amen verse 1 Peter
[10:45] 2:9 but you are a chosen generation a
[10:48] royal priesthood a holy nation A
[10:51] peculiar people that you should show
[10:55] forth the Praises of him who had called
[10:57] you out of Darkness into His Marvelous
[11:00] Light for he
[11:02] testifieth you are the priest
[11:05] Forever After the order of
[11:09] MEC may the Lord add the blessing from
[11:11] the reading of his scripture you all may
[11:13] be
[11:15] seated praise
[11:17] God
[11:18] so we always thank the Lord for this
[11:21] privilege amen praise God to read and to
[11:27] listen and to praise and worship him
[11:29] praise God hallelujah so maybe next
[11:34] time I will also play the
[11:37] [Laughter]
[11:45] saop yeah I love music that's why I said
[11:53] U by heart I I am a
[11:56] musicians and I'm business is
[12:00] minded and nothing in my body that is of
[12:04] god you know that is God you know
[12:06] thinking about God praise God but with
[12:09] his Mercy praise God he call us and uh
[12:13] he allow us he trust us to work in his
[12:15] field that's why I always this has just
[12:18] a um great
[12:20] privilege uh it's an honor for me and uh
[12:24] praise God see that God really trust us
[12:27] this much you know see Hallelujah so I
[12:32] want to speak about like what the Bible
[12:34] said um see he sang a new song He
[12:39] redeemed Us in verse 10 he said he has
[12:41] made us King and Priests see God did not
[12:47] just redeem us for nothing so he has a
[12:50] purpose remember that praise God he he
[12:54] he's not just about us and then put us
[12:56] in one place and we're not not doing
[12:59] anything okay he has a plan for us okay
[13:04] and the Bible says he has made us so
[13:07] like the prophet always said it is in
[13:09] past tence see praise God that's why he
[13:12] said that if you hear somebody said that
[13:14] Jesus uh praise God Jesus is um heal uh
[13:19] God's healing he said no that's a lie
[13:22] because he had already healed you see
[13:24] it's past then praise God he done that
[13:27] 2,000 years ago
[13:29] at the cross of Calvary praise God so
[13:31] same thing he had made us Kings and
[13:36] Priests see the Bible never said that he
[13:39] is going to make us King and priest
[13:42] praise God but he's already in past
[13:44] tense praise God that's why I to today I
[13:47] just want to speak about the you know
[13:50] the heart of the believer praise God see
[13:54] I give this a title of uh in the order
[13:56] of MC praise the Lord see Hallelujah
[14:02] remember this it says here he had made
[14:04] us verse 10 he had made us Kings and
[14:08] Priests praise God one time I share
[14:10] about the chosen generation see there is
[14:13] one generation that is missing praise
[14:16] God say because after Jesus Christ there
[14:19] need to be one generation because the
[14:22] Bible said we need a 14th generation
[14:26] from coming out of Babylon to Jesus
[14:28] Christ
[14:30] amen see and we saw that praise God the
[14:33] last name is Lord Jesus Christ and there
[14:36] is no name higher than name Jesus Christ
[14:39] see so this 14th generation that is
[14:42] coming praise God hallelujah and Peter
[14:46] saw it it was a chosen generation they
[14:48] cannot name it like I like I Shar it
[14:51] before nobody can name her see the
[14:55] apostles just said they are a chosen
[14:57] generation they are the elect they are
[14:59] without spot without drinkers without
[15:01] blemish but they cannot put the name
[15:04] praise God see only in our age the 14th
[15:08] name appear praise God and what is the
[15:12] name higher than the name Lord Jesus
[15:14] Christ nothing that's why the prophet
[15:17] always keep on saying
[15:19] he he swear in his own name right
[15:22] because there is no name higher than
[15:24] that name praise God see the 14th name
[15:28] must be equally praise God equal with
[15:32] the 13 13th name see and the 13th name
[15:35] is Jesus Christ see no name can be
[15:38] higher than that name praise God that's
[15:41] why the 14th name is also Jesus Christ
[15:44] amen and M Jesus Christ okay so we have
[15:48] that chosen generation then it says we
[15:51] are in the lineage of a royal
[15:54] priesthood praise God so remember this
[15:57] we have something to do we have praise
[16:01] God see Hallelujah see now in the
[16:06] beginning when man fall in sin God is a
[16:10] holy God see in that condition if God
[16:14] will allow his children to face him they
[16:16] will
[16:17] die praise God and and the father love
[16:21] his children so he's trying to make a
[16:24] way praise God see for them not to die
[16:28] see so what he did so every time his
[16:31] children trying to approach him there
[16:34] are two sherim to sherim that will close
[16:37] the
[16:37] throne see they will spread their
[16:42] wings one that way one this way to cover
[16:47] the face of the father see in that
[16:50] condition they will die praise God see
[16:54] so now there is in between the wings of
[16:57] that cherubim become the mercy of the
[17:00] father see praise God there is in
[17:03] between them
[17:05] Hallelujah
[17:07] see the children the son speak the
[17:12] father answered them the father speak
[17:14] the son ask question and so on but they
[17:18] they cannot see the face of God anymore
[17:21] for he is Holy okay so that Wing serve
[17:25] us the mercy of God praise God
[17:29] see Hallelujah until the time of Moses
[17:32] when God wants to speak to his
[17:34] children God always want to speak to his
[17:37] children but with that condition they
[17:39] will die praise God hallelujah see now
[17:45] so he he said to Moses gather my people
[17:48] I want to speak to them I want to speak
[17:50] to them God always want to speak to his
[17:52] people see praise God but then he said
[17:56] to Moses bring them to to Horeb bring
[17:59] them to Mount Si and put tie put a robe
[18:04] around that mountain in that way nobody
[18:06] can approach that mountain even the
[18:09] animal if anybody cross that line cross
[18:13] that
[18:15] rope Stone it to death Spear and thrust
[18:20] it to death see praise God that is the
[18:24] Commandment that is the word of the Lord
[18:26] for God is Holy praise God see
[18:30] Hallelujah so Moses tie a rope around
[18:34] that mountain no then that throat become
[18:37] a boundary praise God see any any animal
[18:42] that will cross that is that maybe a
[18:47] thin rope maybe an inch stick but
[18:50] anybody that will cross that Trope it
[18:54] will be stoned to death see or they will
[18:57] spirit until it
[18:59] die see but as long as they are behind
[19:03] that Rob that robe yeah serve us the
[19:07] mercy of
[19:09] God see it become the mercy of God even
[19:13] even how thin the Rope is it it is the
[19:17] mercy of God see once you cross that
[19:22] rope you're
[19:25] fish
[19:27] see that Rob serve as the mercy of
[19:32] God hallelujah see
[19:35] now now here's Moses remember he had
[19:39] made
[19:40] us Kings and
[19:43] Priests praise God so
[19:48] Moses praise God he's he he's just a
[19:52] simple
[19:53] man right there's nothing in Moses
[19:58] praise
[19:59] God see but God loves
[20:03] Moses so he asked Moses to take his
[20:06] people to that mountain so he can speak
[20:09] to
[20:10] them see then Moses tied the Rope then
[20:14] God gave his
[20:15] commandment and people hear the voice of
[20:19] God praise God
[20:23] see then Mo then God asked Moses to come
[20:26] up he said I want to talk to you
[20:30] then Aaron and several Elders came with
[20:32] Moses but then God said to Moses just
[20:35] leave them leave them in the
[20:36] middle only you can come
[20:39] up so Moses went and talked to the
[20:42] father while he was on that
[20:45] mountain his
[20:47] Brethren
[20:52] see they were
[20:54] impatience
[20:57] right for 40 days only 40 days maybe
[21:01] only in 30 days they were so
[21:04] impatient right
[21:11] see they make this golden
[21:17] C then while on the
[21:23] mountain after 40 days God said to Moses

[28:03] wood then he put the sherub him
[28:06] right praise
[28:08] God
[28:10] see because in the Garden of Eden the
[28:13] cherubim serve as the mercy of
[28:16] God then he put another wood on top of
[28:21] that mercy
[28:24] seat and inside there
[28:28] is the tablets we know the three things
[28:30] in there the golden jar with the golden
[28:33] with the hidden
[28:35] Mana then we have the rod of Aon then we
[28:39] have that golden tablets the two tablets
[28:41] of the Ten
[28:43] Commandments
[28:45] see you know the power of the art they
[28:49] know the power of the
[28:51] art praise
[28:53] God see do you know how powerful the ark
[29:01] is one
[29:03] day when they are trying to conquer the
[29:06] Jericho the wall of
[29:08] Jericho they did nothing they just carry
[29:12] the ark and they move around and that
[29:14] wall of Jericho fall down when they
[29:18] cross that River Jordan they did
[29:22] nothing see they just put the Ark on
[29:25] their
[29:26] shoulder
[29:28] when that priest touched the water the
[29:32] power of the Ark when when through them
[29:36] from the shoulder going down to their
[29:38] feet and that dried up the River Jordan
[29:42] so they know the power of the
[29:44] Ark see then one day you
[29:50] know
[29:51] they they go against
[29:55] God and the son of Eli
[29:58] panas you
[30:01] know and Hof they took the art and take
[30:05] it to the battlefield remember

[30:25] worry maybe the God of Israel he is
[30:28] powerful on the mountain but we are
[30:31] going we're going against them on the
[30:37] plane see so when they carry the ark
[30:42] into the battlefield everybody's
[30:45] rejoicing but we know what
[30:48] happened God is using the
[30:51] Philistine to chastise
[30:54] them and the Philistine caught the ark
[30:58] see when that AR was caught the
[31:01] Philistine bring it to their
[31:03] country and put it in one
[31:06] city praise God but God sent the plagues
[31:10] and they were scared and put it in
[31:12] another city God again send the plagues
[31:15] see and take it to another city God send
[31:17] the plagues
[31:19] again they take it to the five cities
[31:22] and God sent five
[31:25] plagues don't try to help God
[31:27] God God knew what he is
[31:32] doing
[31:34] see so when that happened the Philistine
[31:38] were so
[31:39] scared how can we fight against God we
[31:43] are just
[31:45] human so they called the high
[31:49] priest then the high priest said Okay if
[31:53] that is God then let God fight against
[31:56] God
[31:58] see so they took that Ark into the
[32:01] Temple of
[32:05] Deon they said let our God deal with
[32:08] this God of
[32:10] Israel and you know the god of Israel is
[32:15] so small and Deon is 100t
[32:20] high they said look look at their God
[32:24] it's so little so tiny compared with Our
[32:28] God so don't worry tomorrow everything
[32:31] will be finished right and they closed
[32:34] their
[32:37] Temple and that
[32:39] night they heard something
[32:42] loud
[32:45] boom he said it's
[32:51] finished the following morning when the
[32:54] high priest opened the
[32:56] door everybody was
[32:59] surprised they G their God their Idol
[33:03] fall down flat face
[33:07] flat oh
[33:09] my so the high priest said okay don't
[33:13] worry this is just a first
[33:17] round again try it
[33:20] again raise it up again and they said
[33:24] okay we're going to ask these young
[33:26] people people they're going to do some
[33:30] vils they will sing and praise our God
[33:35] Deon they close the
[33:38] door they sing continuously they shout
[33:42] continuously they keep on praising their
[33:46] gods see then in the middle of the
[33:50] night something happened again there's a
[33:54] loud Crush mhm boom and this something
[33:58] is broken to Pieces they said Oh Our God
[34:02] is so angry that's why maybe stump that
[34:06] God of Israel into
[34:08] pieces
[34:11] see then the following morning when the
[34:14] sun is starting to to rise you know they
[34:18] open the
[34:22] gate but they were so
[34:25] surprised their God God was broken into
[34:28] pieces was crushed into pieces and they
[34:31] said who can fight against the god of
[34:36] Israel what shall we
[34:39] do they took two
[34:42] kinds then they built a new
[34:46] card they put that card on the
[34:48] kinds they put the Ark of the Covenant
[34:51] there nothing
[34:54] happened they touch it nothing happened
[34:58] yeah then they put the gold you see they
[35:01] said we need to to give the god of
[35:03] Israel a peace
[35:06] offering give him some gold as our peace
[35:11] offering see all the plagues that he
[35:15] sent to us let's make it let's use the
[35:19] gold in the form of the plague that he
[35:21] sent us as a peace
[35:25] offering then the priest said
[35:27] okay if the kind went this
[35:30] way it means it is only by chance it is
[35:34] not the hand of Israel the god of Israel
[35:37] but if the kind went into
[35:40] beemus it is the hand of God of
[35:43] Israel
[35:45] see so the
[35:47] priest let they they face the kind
[35:51] toward
[35:54] there but the cattle went on this way
[35:58] turn its way into
[36:01] BSIS now they believe that is the hand
[36:05] of the god of
[36:07] Israel see so the kind wine into
[36:11] BSIS nothing happen nobody get
[36:15] killed nobody get
[36:18] killed Samuel chapter 6: 19 1 Samuel and
[36:24] is it says here 12 CH 6:
[36:31] 12-5
[36:33] 12 up
[36:38] up and the kind took the straight way
[36:41] verse 12 took the straight way to the
[36:45] way of
[36:46] BSIS and went along the highway loving
[36:49] as they went and turn not aside to the
[36:51] right hand or to the left and the Lords
[36:55] and the Lords of Philistines went after
[36:57] them unto the border of BSIS and they of
[37:00] BSIS were reaping their wheat harvest in
[37:03] the valley and they lifted up their eyes
[37:05] and saw the AR and rejoiced to see
[37:07] it and the cart came into the field of
[37:10] Joseph bsite and stood there where there
[37:13] was a great Stone and they climed the
[37:15] wood of the cart and offered a kind of
[37:17] burnt offering unto the Lord and the
[37:20] Levites took down the Ark of the Lord
[37:22] and Cofer that was with it wherein the
[37:25] jewels of gold were put them on the
[37:27] great Stone and the man of bsem is offer
[37:30] bur offering and sacrifice sacrifices
[37:32] the same day unto the Lord nothing
[37:35] happened nobody got
[37:38] killed nobody got killed but then in
[37:42] verse
[37:43] 19 and he smot the man of
[37:47] BSIS because they had looked into the
[37:50] Ark of the Lord even is M the people
[37:55] 50,000 and three three score and 10 men
[37:57] and the people lamented because the Lord
[38:00] had Smitt many of the people with a
[38:02] great Slaughter and the man of ver 7
[38:05] said who is able to stand before the
[38:07] holy God of is holy Lord God and to
[38:12] whom shall we go up from us shall he go
[38:15] up from us
[38:18] see so when they take the
[38:21] cart no
[38:24] problem they got hold of the Ark
[38:27] and put it down no problem Mercy is
[38:31] still there there is
[38:33] Mercy
[38:35] nobody
[38:37] die but something
[38:40] happened they took that Sher
[38:44] beam down nothing
[38:47] happened but when they remove that piece
[38:51] of food on top of that Ark of the
[38:54] Covenant Mercy is finished
[39:02] Mercy's
[39:05] finished people got
[39:08] killed
[39:11] see that one piece of
[39:13] food it looks
[39:18] insignificant but that is the mercy of
[39:21] God as long as it's in the top of
[39:25] that
[39:27] item of that Ark of the Covenant nobody
[39:30] will get
[39:31] killed but when they remove
[39:34] that Mercy is
[39:38] over see
[39:41] now
[39:43] Moses as long as Moses pleaded for his
[39:46] people God cannot touch them yeah
[39:49] remember that right God cannot touch
[39:54] them see the people were they they they
[39:58] they go against God Moses Lord

[40:43] everything will be all
[40:47] right as long as Moses know how to
[40:51] plead God cannot touch
[40:55] them even and God was so
[40:58] angry I will wipe them out Moses and I
[41:02] will start with you don't

[41:23] Lord but kill me first yeah kill me
[41:29] first if you want to kill them kill me
[41:33] first then God said because of you
[41:38] Moses because there is one
[41:41] Moses We
[41:42] Stand between the
[41:47] Gap Lord don't do it you want to do it K
[41:54] me
[41:55] first then God
[41:57] said I won't touch them
[42:01] Moses but then one
[42:03] day that's why I've been telling you to
[42:06] the minister watch your
[42:09] heart watch your
[42:12] heart then
[42:14] Moses you
[42:16] know he lost his
[42:19] patience remember that he lost his
[42:23] patience people got thirsty hang God
[42:26] said to Moses
[42:28] Moses just speak to the Rock no problem
[42:31] just speak to the Rock right but
[42:36] Moses he lost his patient he said you
[42:39] people you stiff naked people you

[42:49] brother you know where they come from

[43:07] they are step naked Nation Moses said L
[43:09] Lord

[43:13] Moses when he did that he hit the rock
[43:17] twice right he break all the
[43:22] typology but he still God's Prophet yeah
[43:27] but then God said okay
[43:31] Moses you're
[43:34] tired but you're
[43:37] finished I cannot use you
[43:40] anymore I cannot use you
[43:43] anymore because God did
[43:47] somebody between him and the people
[43:51] right that will
[43:54] reconcile the sin of the people people
[43:56] to
[43:57] him see he needs
[44:01] somebody praise
[44:10] God he says in Hebrew chapter
[44:13] 2 verse
[44:15] 17 Hebrew
[44:17] 2:17 wherefore in all things it behov
[44:20] him to be made like unto his Brethren
[44:23] that he might be merciful and faithful
[44:25] High priest in things pertaining to God
[44:28] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[44:30] the people he needs
[44:33] somebody see like his Brethren that has
[44:37] compassion to the people to the children
[44:40] of
[44:41] God a
[44:43] merciful faithful pertaining to the work
[44:46] of God right but then he cannot use
[44:49] Moses
[44:53] anymore see because Moses SED with
[45:01] God Moses sided with
[45:04] God God
[45:06] wants a
[45:08] person that can be touched by the
[45:12] infirmities of his
[45:17] Brethren see a
[45:22] priest praise
[45:24] God see a high priest faithful high
[45:28] priest in things pertaining to God to
[45:31] make reconciliation for the SS of the
[45:33] people that will say
[45:36] Lord look at my brother look at my
[45:40] sister
[45:44] Lord we are shapen in
[45:47] iniquity we come to this word speaking
[45:51] lies help us
[45:54] Lord for forgive my brother forgive my
[45:58] sister but when he sided with
[46:02] God he finished God cannot choose it
[46:07] anymore he wants
[46:09] somebody you know he choose
[46:13] Moses because Moses has the heart he has
[46:16] compassion to his people
[46:19] right see he has compassion to his
[46:22] people when Moses lose that compassion
[46:27] God cannot use him anymore when he call
[46:30] his people Rebels God cannot use him
[46:33] anymore
[46:34] right
[46:36] see he needs somebody between him and
[46:40] his people that will
[46:43] plead for his people but then Moses
[46:47] sided with God and that's finished
[46:51] him
[46:53] then God start to to use a
[46:57] priest see that's the start of what we
[47:01] call after
[47:03] Moses then God said to Moses you're
[47:06] finished let Aaron
[47:08] took as Aaron and his children to come
[47:12] with me wash them anoint them they will
[47:17] now become a priest now that's the start
[47:20] of what we call the
[47:22] priesthood the aonic priesthood
[47:26] see during that time only the family of
[47:31] Aon can become a priest there is the
[47:34] tribes of Levites Aon came from the
[47:36] tribe of Levites but
[47:39] only Aon only the family of Aaron can
[47:44] become a
[47:45] priest not all in the F not All in the
[47:49] Family of the tribe of
[47:50] Levites some family in the tribe of
[47:53] Levites they can work they can serve in
[47:55] the temple but when it come to
[47:56] priesthood only
[47:59] Aon but you know when the times goes on
[48:02] in the time of priest Eli remember him
[48:06] his son pineas and
[48:09] hni
[48:11] see Eli he favored his son he honored
[48:15] his son more than
[48:17] God God was so angry
[48:20] again that's why he used
[48:24] Samuel see
[48:26] Samuel tell
[48:29] him did I not choose
[48:32] you did I not choose your
[48:36] family but then he said I will cut off
[48:39] his
[48:42] hand praise God God was so angry with
[48:46] Eli see until the
[48:54] time
[48:58] see until the time of
[49:02] Solomon
[49:04] see you know priest high priest
[49:08] Avatar see
[49:11] Solomon praise God
[49:14] Hallelujah in first king chapter 2: 27
[49:18] so Solomon trust out avatar from being
[49:20] priest unto the Lord that he might
[49:23] fulfill the word of the Lord which he
[49:24] spake conc in the house of Eli in
[49:27] Silo that's the end of a ironic
[49:31] priesthood that stopped the eronic
[49:34] priesthood but you know when Aon become
[49:39] a
[49:39] priest do you remember that Kora datan
[49:44] and a they go against Moses they said
[49:47] Moses do you think you are the only one
[49:49] that is
[49:51] Holy do you think God only called you we
[49:54] are also called by God
[49:56] MH see when that happened praise God God
[50:02] was
[50:04] angry Moses humbled
[50:06] himself he said to his his brother and
[50:10] sister look I did not call myself it is
[50:15] God okay he said God will prove
[50:19] you remember that they took that the rod
[50:23] you know the 12 rods you know
[50:26] and then the rod of Aon bed and it bear
[50:30] fruit see when that happened God was
[50:34] angry with Kora he said okay take their
[50:36] family and God killed them you know when
[50:39] that
[50:40] happened people
[50:44] complain praise God they question the
[50:46] Judgment of God don't question the
[50:48] Judgment of
[50:49] God when they
[50:52] complain praise God God was so angry he
[50:57] said Moses okay separate yourself from
[51:02] these
[51:04] people after God tell it to Moses praise
[51:07] God
[51:09] hallelujah
[51:22] see Numbers chapter 16 verse
[51:26] 45-48 look he said get you up 45 among
[51:32] this congregation that I may consume
[51:35] them as in a moment and they fell upon
[51:38] their faces and Moses said unto Aaron
[51:41] take a sensor and put fire therein from
[51:44] off the Altar and put on incense and go
[51:47] quickly unto the congregation and make
[51:50] an atonement for them for there is R gun
[51:53] out of the Lord the plague is begone
[51:56] praise God the plague is begun and Aaron
[51:58] took as Moses commanded and ran into the
[52:01] midst of the congregation and behold the
[52:03] plague was begun among the people and he
[52:06] put on incense and made an atonement for
[52:08] the people and and he stood between the
[52:12] dead and the living and the plague
[52:17] stay my
[52:19] look left and
[52:21] right people are dying people are dying
[52:26] see and Moses said the plag is start go
[52:31] Aon go to the
[52:33] temple make an atonement for the people
[52:36] take that sensor with you he went
[52:39] straight inside the
[52:41] Tabernacle praise God and take that
[52:45] sensor and he run
[52:47] back you know he run back and people
[52:50] just keep on dying left and
[52:53] right face for for falling face down
[52:56] left and die but when he when he you
[53:00] know when he
[53:01] stand where he
[53:03] stand the Bible said the plague is STO
[53:08] yeah death cannot cross on that one man
[53:13] one man right that cannot cross cannot
[53:17] pass through that body of
[53:19] Aon
[53:21] Aon become the mercy of God yeah
[53:26] see praise God imagine look at that
[53:31] brother praise
[53:33] God
[53:36] hallelujah see that's why God said I
[53:39] need somebody like your
[53:42] brethren praise God who is
[53:45] merciful who is a faithful high priest
[53:49] doing things pertaining to
[53:52] God
[53:53] see God God is looking for that
[53:58] person who is
[54:01] merciful see who will not go out
[54:05] Hallelujah and keep pointing finger
[54:07] praise God you serpent seed you son of
[54:10] the demon
[54:11] devil
[54:14] Hallelujah I know you are a serpent seed
[54:17] because you cannot accept this
[54:19] message you're
[54:21] finished God cannot use
[54:24] you
[54:26] that's why I've been telling it to the
[54:29] believer don't take that comp compassion
[54:33] take that out that compassion in your
[54:35] heart remember that thank you praise
[54:40] God God is looking for a
[54:43] priest not a
[54:45] judge
[54:48] Hallelujah see praise
[54:52] God so when Eli
[54:55] then
[54:57] Solomon praise
[55:00] God the time of
[55:02] Solomon so he put out
[55:06] Avatar he thrust out avatar from being
[55:08] prison to the Lord that is the last line
[55:12] of the priesthood of the aonic
[55:15] priesthood after that the levitical
[55:17] priesthood come
[55:19] in see anybody
[55:22] now as long as you are in the tribe of
[55:25] leevi you can be a
[55:28] priest see you can become a high priest
[55:33] as long as you are in the tribes of
[55:35] Levites first as long as you are in the
[55:38] family of Aon you can be a high priest
[55:43] outside the family of Aaron you cannot
[55:45] be a
[55:46] priest praise God hallelujah until the
[55:50] time of abot the priest that he is the
[55:52] last lineage of Aaron
[55:55] then now all the levitic all the Levites
[55:59] can become a
[56:00] priests praise God hallelujah see so
[56:05] when Jesus come on that
[56:07] time there is the levitical priesthood
[56:11] serving the temple that's why the Bible
[56:13] is very clear as long as there are
[56:16] priests on this Earth he cannot come as
[56:19] a priest that's why when Jesus come on
[56:21] Earth he come as a son of man right see
[56:26] because there are priest that's serving
[56:28] in the temple priest that will praise
[56:32] God
[56:33] perform praise God that is pertaining to
[56:35] the
[56:36] Lord see
[56:41] Hallelujah that's why Jesus said destroy
[56:44] the
[56:47] temple I will build it in 3
[56:50] days and you know the Jew cannot
[56:53] understand it there are three things
[56:56] that that you
[56:57] need
[56:59] okay if you are going Paul knew it if
[57:03] you are trying to give a Jew a religion
[57:06] they need the three things first is the
[57:09] temple second is the
[57:12] sacrifice see third is the priest
[57:16] without these three elements there is no
[57:18] Temple
[57:19] worshipping for the Jew see that's why
[57:23] in The Book of Hebrew
[57:25] Paul is trying to tell them he start he
[57:28] said praise God do you know how God
[57:30] speak to us in the beginning praise God
[57:33] he speak in s times he said he speak to
[57:36] signs and wonders praise God see and
[57:39] then finally he speak through the
[57:41] prophet then he said at at the end he
[57:42] speak through his son am see praise God
[57:46] then he speak about the angel about the
[57:48] man then he speak about praise God
[57:51] hallelujah chapter 3 chapter 4 about the
[57:53] Sabbath because because you need to
[57:55] address it praise God Paul knew it Paul
[57:59] will not just accept praise God a
[58:02] religion that has nothing to do with
[58:04] Judaism praise God Paul then Paul said
[58:07] it is a shadow of the good things to
[58:10] come see the blood of the animal cannot
[58:14] cleanse cleanse us it can only cover the
[58:16] sin but it cannot cleanse us but now
[58:19] here is the the real sacrifice once and
[58:22] for all he offer his blood
[58:25] right praise God one time then he said
[58:30] praise God see this Temple is made by
[58:33] the hands of man but this
[58:36] Temple it is not made by the hands of
[58:38] man but by the hands of God right so he
[58:41] keep on explaining it you know to the
[58:43] Jew because they need these three
[58:48] things Hallelujah then
[58:51] finally he said in Hebrew chapter 7 7
[58:56] verse 1-1
[58:57] 17
[59:00] see for this
[59:02] mcedc king of Salem priest of the prince
[59:06] priest of the most high God praise God
[59:09] slide number 12 who met Abraham
[59:13] returning from his Slaughter of the
[59:14] Kings and blessed him see so
[59:18] now Paul is trying to remind the
[59:21] Jew do you remember Meed
[59:25] because he needs to give them a priest
[59:27] right without the priest they cannot do
[59:31] the temple
[59:33] worshiping the Jew are looking for the
[59:36] priest praise God see so now Paul said
[59:41] do you remember
[59:43] madc he is the priest of the most high
[59:46] God in verse two he said to whom Abraham
[59:49] gave a 10 part of all first being by
[59:53] interpretation king of ch righteousness
[59:55] and after that also king of Salem which
[59:58] is king of king of Peace verse four he
[1:00:02] says now consider how great this man was
[1:00:05] unto whom even the patriarch Abraham
[1:00:08] gave the tent of the
[1:00:10] spoils see now he said do you remember
[1:00:16] mcedc praise God he is the king of Salem
[1:00:19] he is the king of righteousness yes
[1:00:21] that's true but do you know that even
[1:00:25] Abraham gave TI thingss to him
[1:00:30] right see Abraham gave 10 of his
[1:00:37] spoil to him what does it mean that's
[1:00:42] why in verse 5 it said and verily that
[1:00:44] they are sons of Levi who received the
[1:00:47] office of the priesthood have a
[1:00:49] commandment to take
[1:00:51] tithes he's trying to tell to the people
[1:00:53] look this Levites they are receiving tis
[1:00:56] M why they are receiving
[1:00:59] tis because they are priests yeah okay
[1:01:03] so now he is trying to tell to the
[1:01:05] people This
[1:01:07] MC he received even Abraham the Pat gave
[1:01:11] his titing to this man it means that he
[1:01:14] is a
[1:01:17] priest see and this madc he said praise
[1:01:23] God we verse 7 without contradic with
[1:01:27] all contradiction the less is blessed of
[1:01:29] the better and here men that die receive
[1:01:32] TI the Levi they received TI but there
[1:01:34] he received them of whom it is witnessed
[1:01:36] at Heth and as verse n and as I may also
[1:01:41] say Levi also who received ties pay ties
[1:01:43] in
[1:01:45] Abraham see so now then Paul is trying
[1:01:49] to tell them
[1:01:51] look this MC he even this he even receiv
[1:01:56] even the Levites pay tis to
[1:01:59] him see so Paul is trying to tell them
[1:02:04] it seems that this MEC priesthood is
[1:02:07] much higher than the
[1:02:09] Levi because even the Levites they pay
[1:02:12] their tights this Levites they are
[1:02:15] receiving titing but then Levites also
[1:02:19] pay their
[1:02:20] ties to this
[1:02:22] men praise God
[1:02:27] Hallelujah for he was he said for he was
[1:02:30] yet in the loins of the father liit when
[1:02:32] MC met
[1:02:35] him
[1:02:36] Hallelujah
[1:02:38] see Paul is trying to tell them how
[1:02:42] great is this
[1:02:44] priesthood that even Levites give their
[1:02:47] tithings to him right amen so it is
[1:02:50] higher the priesthood of MC is higher
[1:02:54] higher than the priesthood of the
[1:02:56] levite praise God but
[1:02:59] then verse
[1:03:01] 11 H Allelujah in verse 12 if therefore
[1:03:05] Perfection were by the levitical
[1:03:07] priesthood for under it the people
[1:03:09] received the law what farther need was
[1:03:11] there that another priest should rise
[1:03:13] after the order of melc and not be
[1:03:16] called after the order of Aeron for the
[1:03:18] priesthood being changed there is made a
[1:03:20] necessity a change also of the law
[1:03:23] praise God see Hallelujah see now he
[1:03:27] said if we need to change the law praise
[1:03:31] God if we need another
[1:03:33] priesthood praise God there must be a
[1:03:36] law to supers it there must be a law
[1:03:40] higher than the than the first one if we
[1:03:43] want to change it see God is God of law
[1:03:49] remember that we have this law of
[1:03:51] gravity praise God hallelujah see
[1:03:54] everything must come down when you throw
[1:03:57] the ball it will come down because of
[1:03:59] the law of gravity but how come the bird
[1:04:02] like the prophet say how come the bird
[1:04:03] can
[1:04:04] fly see because there is a certain law
[1:04:07] in his body praise God that supersede
[1:04:10] the law of that
[1:04:12] gravity Hallelujah see so we need the
[1:04:16] law praise God if you want to change
[1:04:19] this priesthood we need a law see how
[1:04:23] this how this levitical priesthood
[1:04:26] become a priest praise God
[1:04:33] hallelujah it says here verse 13 for he
[1:04:37] of whom these things are spoken
[1:04:39] pertaining to another tribe of which no
[1:04:41] man gave it attendance to The Altar for
[1:04:44] it is evident that our Lord sprang out
[1:04:46] of Judah of which tribe Moses spake
[1:04:48] nothing concerning prood okay according
[1:04:50] to the law because it is according to
[1:04:52] the law all only the levitical the
[1:04:55] Levites can become a priest right but
[1:04:59] pertaining to
[1:05:01] Jesus he was born in the tribe of Judah
[1:05:05] and pertaining to Judah there is no law
[1:05:08] that will make him a
[1:05:13] priest see and how can Jesus become a
[1:05:20] priest hallelujah how can he become a
[1:05:23] priest if there is no law that will make
[1:05:26] him a
[1:05:28] priest then he said you remember me he
[1:05:32] has no father he has no mother he has no
[1:05:34] beginning he has no end it means that he
[1:05:37] remain a
[1:05:39] priest see then he said can it be in the
[1:05:46] similitude praise
[1:05:48] God can it be this 4 verse 15 for that
[1:05:53] after the similitude of melc there
[1:05:55] ariseth another
[1:05:57] priest see but how did melchisedek
[1:06:01] became a
[1:06:03] priest that's why the Paul said he has
[1:06:07] no beginning he has no end right it
[1:06:10] means that he's aernal
[1:06:12] priest praise God
[1:06:16] hallelujah that's why he said
[1:06:19] here in verse 16 you know the levitical
[1:06:22] priesthood there were made according to
[1:06:26] the law of the carnal
[1:06:28] commandment they become priest because
[1:06:30] of this carnal commandment but this one
[1:06:34] praise
[1:06:36] God he can only become a priest with
[1:06:38] another law what is that law the law of
[1:06:41] without beginning and Without End the
[1:06:44] law of the the power of the Endless life
[1:06:50] right see that's why he said he test
[1:06:54] testify it you are a
[1:06:56] priest he testified he said to the Lord
[1:07:00] you are a
[1:07:01] priest in the order of
[1:07:03] madc see how can he become a
[1:07:06] priest and how can we become a
[1:07:09] priest see remember that he made us King
[1:07:14] he made us priest but how can we become
[1:07:17] a priest come on see we need a law we
[1:07:21] need a certain law we cannot be become a
[1:07:24] Levi we are not born under Israel how
[1:07:27] can you become a
[1:07:29] priest what
[1:07:32] law
[1:07:34] Hallelujah see same thing the law of
[1:07:38] eternal life see once you have that law
[1:07:41] in your
[1:07:42] body sir praise God you know the
[1:07:45] Catholic do we have some Catholic here
[1:07:48] do we have Catholics
[1:07:50] here see Philippines is a 95%
[1:07:54] Catholic so we know the power of the
[1:07:58] Catholic and all priests they have an
[1:08:02] order you know it right this pope
[1:08:06] now he is in the order of Jesuit you
[1:08:10] know it right see the previous one is in
[1:08:13] in the order of Franciscan Francis
[1:08:16] Franciscan order there is the Dominican
[1:08:18] order they have this Franciscan order
[1:08:21] then they have this uh the order of
[1:08:23] Jesuit
[1:08:25] see there must be an order without an
[1:08:29] order you cannot become a
[1:08:31] priest
[1:08:34] Hallelujah see but now we have that
[1:08:39] order we have that law that make us
[1:08:42] priest amen exactly the law of eternal
[1:08:45] life right
[1:08:48] Hallelujah see you are a
[1:08:50] priest in the order of madc right amen
[1:08:55] praise God
[1:08:57] hallelujah
[1:09:00] look now the prophet
[1:09:05] said now the levitical priesthood cease
[1:09:09] at the death of the Lord
[1:09:11] Jesus now we live in the Mec priesthood
[1:09:16] of
[1:09:18] Christ
[1:09:22] see
[1:09:24] when Jesus was on Earth he cannot be a
[1:09:27] priest because there is a priest on this
[1:09:30] Earth
[1:09:31] performing in the book of Hebrew Paul
[1:09:34] said he cannot be a priest because
[1:09:36] somebody is is doing the job in the
[1:09:38] temple is doing that work in the temple
[1:09:42] that's why when he come here he was the
[1:09:44] son of man when he went to
[1:09:47] heaven remember when he was on Earth as
[1:09:50] a son of man yeah they saw this woman
[1:09:53] man commit adultery he said according to
[1:09:57] Moses according to the law he should die
[1:10:00] she should
[1:10:01] die then he said okay those who have no
[1:10:04] sin throw the first
[1:10:08] stone everybody left the sin right until
[1:10:11] there's Jesus
[1:10:13] only then he
[1:10:15] said I forgive
[1:10:18] you they were surprised only God can
[1:10:21] forgive but Jesus said the son of man
[1:10:25] has power to forgive sin exactly right
[1:10:29] right but
[1:10:32] then when they crucify
[1:10:35] him that Chang the
[1:10:37] ministry from the son of
[1:10:39] man to the Son of
[1:10:44] God
[1:10:45] father forgive
[1:10:49] them when he was on Earth as a son of
[1:10:52] man I forgive give you when he was
[1:10:55] lifted up on Earth he is now the Son of
[1:11:01] God as the priest yeah father forgive
[1:11:06] them that's why he is a priest that can
[1:11:08] be touched with our
[1:11:12] infirmities
[1:11:14] Hallelujah but then at the opening of
[1:11:17] the
[1:11:19] seals something happened again yeah see
[1:11:23] the prophet said I want to teach this I
[1:11:25] want I want this the message of
[1:11:30] indictment he keep on saying he wants to
[1:11:33] preaches until praise God when the seals
[1:11:37] is open praise
[1:11:39] God that is finally he
[1:11:44] said he went into the message of the
[1:11:46] trial court trials then finally he
[1:11:50] said I indict this generation
[1:11:54] for the second
[1:11:56] crucifixion
[1:11:58] right
[1:12:01] see that fulfill when Moses hit the rock
[1:12:06] twice but is also fulfilling
[1:12:10] something see praise God the ministry
[1:12:14] now is
[1:12:17] changing is
[1:12:20] changing from the Son of God again
[1:12:24] coming down as the son of
[1:12:28] man praise
[1:12:30] God
[1:12:32] hallelujah
[1:12:34] see that's why he preaches marriage and
[1:12:37] divorce remember that when he preached
[1:12:40] that marriage and
[1:12:42] divorce he laid down all the
[1:12:45] rules then he said at the
[1:12:49] end it is not it is not God it is Paul
[1:12:52] it is not Moses is is is the god this is
[1:12:54] Moses yeah Moses pleaded for the for his
[1:12:57] people Paul pleaded for his people I
[1:13:00] plead for my people too
[1:13:04] yeah then after the service he said go

[1:13:10] are remember there is one woman who
[1:13:14] understand what he's trying to tell yeah
[1:13:17] and he is a woman

[1:13:24] is trying to
[1:13:25] teach that he's forgiving the
[1:13:31] people how can you do that only God can
[1:13:35] forgive
[1:13:38] sin then he
[1:13:40] preached who is this
[1:13:43] madc he's trying to show us who you are
[1:13:47] that's right who you
[1:13:50] are see Hallelujah
[1:13:55] last
[1:13:56] slide that's why Paul said here in 1
[1:14:00] Corinthians chapter 7: 12-
[1:14:03] 14 but to the rest speak
[1:14:09] I on can we say it but to the rest speak

[1:23:15] he he's the one we're all looking for is
[1:23:18] he amen enjoy the message amen let's
[1:23:22] give our brother a good
[1:23:26] hand as we're going into the
[1:23:30] communion make me you go ahead and go
[1:23:33] back we'll go into the communion part
[1:23:37] because it's the one thing that we are
[1:23:39] firm Believers in
[1:23:42] and we had to pass it up last weekend
[1:23:45] because we were having a lot of things
[1:23:47] to go on and you know and so we moved it
[1:23:51] over to this weekend to have the
[1:23:52] communion and all but just tell our
[1:23:55] brother how much you appreciate him and
[1:23:57] if anybody has anything else we always
[1:23:59] take care of the offering if anybody has
[1:24:01] anything else you'd like to give our
[1:24:02] brother you know for anything uh feel
[1:24:06] free to do and just if you want to write
[1:24:08] a check write it to the church and it'll
[1:24:10] go right straight to him whatever you
[1:24:12] want to do if you want to give him an
[1:24:14] extra doing but make sure you tell him
[1:24:16] how much you appreciate him ministering
[1:24:18] because we appreciate the ministry I
[1:24:21] believe in it
[1:24:23] and I thank God for it because that's
[1:24:25] what it is see everybody's a priest and
[1:24:28] a king because we're all in the same
[1:24:30] category but what about the
[1:24:34] ministry
[1:24:35] the it's not just priests and Kings cuz
[1:24:39] everybody's a priest and King we're all
[1:24:41] the
[1:24:41] same but then the ministry is brought
[1:24:44] into to another level on that
[1:24:46] right see you ain't got another priest
[1:24:48] and King to put it but it is another
[1:24:51] level
[1:24:52] because that's God's way of doing things
[1:24:54] is it
[1:24:55] amen if you'd like to follow along in
[1:24:57] your scripture turn to First
[1:25:00] Corinthians
[1:25:02] 11:23 for I have received of the Lord
[1:25:05] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:25:07] that the Lord Jesus in the same night
[1:25:09] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:25:11] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:25:14] he broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:25:16] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:25:19] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:25:22] all so he took the cup when he had s
[1:25:24] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:25:26] my blood this do ye as of as you drink
[1:25:29] it in Rememberance of me for as often as
[1:25:32] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:25:34] you do sh the Lord's death till he come
[1:25:37] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:25:40] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:25:42] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:25:44] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:25:47] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:25:49] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:25:51] that eat e and drinketh unworthily
[1:25:53] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:25:56] not Discerning the Lord's
[1:25:59] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:26:02] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:26:04] we would judge ourselves I love this we
[1:26:07] should not be judged we have to judge
[1:26:10] ourselves but what if we
[1:26:12] don't look what he goes on to say but
[1:26:16] when we are
[1:26:18] judged see he'll he'll take care of
[1:26:20] we're going to be judged for it we're
[1:26:22] chasen to the Lord that we should not be
[1:26:25] condemned with the world see that's a
[1:26:27] wonderful thing for him to do that for
[1:26:29] us you know not talking about worldly
[1:26:31] sin of everything in the books but just
[1:26:34] something may be sometime a little wrong
[1:26:36] a little point a little thought or an
[1:26:38] idea and you just don't get rid of it
[1:26:42] that's why when we come to the communion
[1:26:44] part then we take just a moment of time
[1:26:46] to
[1:26:47] pray and get you know to get rid of
[1:26:50] everything to where we don't have to be
[1:26:53] all
[1:26:54] right wherefore my brethren when you
[1:26:56] come together to eat t one for another
[1:26:59] and if any man hunger let him meat at
[1:27:01] home that you come not together un
[1:27:03] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:27:06] order when I come let's just have a few
[1:27:09] moments of Silent prayer and just
[1:27:10] remember like I said getting rid of all
[1:27:12] the things to
[1:27:15] where that we don't have no problems no
[1:27:17] condemnation no thoughts and let it be
[1:27:20] you know that God would take care of all
[1:27:39] things father we thank you for this day
[1:27:42] and opportunity that you've given us to
[1:27:45] be able to sit down and listen to your
[1:27:46] word we thank you for that because it's
[1:27:49] a great time we are truly priests and
[1:27:51] kings
[1:27:53] we have a kingdom to rule over and we
[1:27:55] have a lot of things it's within that is
[1:27:57] to our benefit but most of all we have
[1:28:00] the ministry to speak to our hearts and
[1:28:03] bring us to let us realize who we are
[1:28:05] and what we're doing here so we just ask
[1:28:07] you now that you'd make us worthy to be
[1:28:10] able to take this communion because it's
[1:28:12] not nothing we could do it's what you've
[1:28:14] already done and we believe you and we
[1:28:16] thank you we just ask you to bless and
[1:28:19] guide each one in Jesus name
[1:28:26] yeah Bible said he took bread and
[1:28:28] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:28:31] bread It's Made for This purpose this
[1:28:34] afternoon that we could just think about
[1:28:37] you think about it we know it's not your
[1:28:41] body but Lord It's the word spoken to
[1:28:45] our hearts and our thoughts is
[1:28:48] transmitted then back into our lives and
[1:28:50] we take a piece of bread and we think
[1:28:53] about you in your word and we just ask
[1:28:57] you Lord to sanctify this bread this
[1:29:00] natural and Lord to sanctify the
[1:29:03] partakers that we may all be together as
[1:29:05] one in you forgive our sins and lead us
[1:29:08] in Jesus
[1:29:15] name always when we're taking to
[1:29:18] communion I think about the children of
[1:29:21] isra
[1:29:22] and they didn't even know what they were
[1:29:25] doing but yet as they would come down
[1:29:28] and then
[1:29:29] they were given the Passover and the
[1:29:31] things and to realize it would come
[1:29:33] right on down to where we are today it
[1:29:36] come right into the time and the point
[1:29:38] and we' understand the
[1:29:40] communion because it would be in your
[1:29:42] word and that to me is why that none of
[1:29:46] the Apostles even though they all you
[1:29:49] know Matthew Mark Luke John and all of
[1:29:51] those even though Luke was not original
[1:29:54] but yet he's right in there close and
[1:29:56] marked and all like that but still in
[1:29:59] none of the writings of Peter or any of
[1:30:02] them they were not chosen to tell about
[1:30:05] the
[1:30:08] communion here's the Apostle Paul comes
[1:30:11] along as one born he set out a due
[1:30:16] season and yet he's
[1:30:18] given the understanding of the communion
[1:30:23] to speak cuz he had all the Old
[1:30:25] Testament background he was a great
[1:30:28] scholar of the word he knew what all of
[1:30:30] those things made and you know they done
[1:30:34] certain things right in our to last Wade
[1:30:37] preaching on it one time for us as it
[1:30:40] did there were certain things that were
[1:30:42] done that
[1:30:44] spoke of the
[1:30:46] communion Jesus wasn't out of the word
[1:30:49] or adding something new he was the word
[1:30:52] wouldn't father we thank you for this
[1:30:54] wine it's gone through the process now
[1:30:57] and it's getting better every day we
[1:31:00] know that it's a type of your blood that
[1:31:02] was shed for each one of us and as we
[1:31:04] eat the bread and we drink the little
[1:31:07] little wine with it Lord tomorrow
[1:31:10] that'll be actually blood cells in our
[1:31:11] body that we can live off of and how
[1:31:14] much more sure is it that we can live
[1:31:16] off your word that has been spoken unto
[1:31:18] us by your servants and things and down
[1:31:21] to time and revealed unto us what this
[1:31:24] really is it's not the body and not the
[1:31:27] blood but it's standing in the place of
[1:31:31] until the time comes we thank you Lord
[1:31:34] for all of these things sanctify the
[1:31:36] wine and the partakers in Jesus
[1:31:47] name come
[1:31:49] morning and I walk
[1:31:53] by the
[1:31:56] river I'll
[1:31:58] rest the
[1:32:01] Ever Green
[1:32:04] Tree I'll
[1:32:07] carry my
[1:32:09] cross through the
[1:32:13] midnight come
[1:32:15] morning there's
[1:32:18] glory for
[1:32:20] me
[1:32:22] sometimes I'm
[1:32:25] despised and
[1:32:29] rejected and I
[1:32:31] question oh
[1:32:34] Father how
[1:32:37] long then I take one more
[1:32:42] look at Mount
[1:32:46] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:32:52] go
[1:32:53] on you know as I said a lot of times
[1:32:56] maybe you wonder why we sing it taking
[1:32:59] to
[1:32:59] communion but just remember the
[1:33:02] communion is for the
[1:33:04] Overcomer and when it's finished here
[1:33:06] then you go out to face the
[1:33:10] world and walk in Christ right well you
[1:33:13] know what happened there in the Bible
[1:33:15] times when they went to
[1:33:18] war the singers went first
[1:33:22] what if there's an enemy up there
[1:33:23] getting ready to battle and think boy we
[1:33:25] going to have a good day today and they
[1:33:27] just start singing and they just start
[1:33:30] walking right towards you and they're
[1:33:32] just
[1:33:35] singing and no wonder we don't
[1:33:38] understand what being priest and King is
[1:33:41] all about what if you had a
[1:33:44] kingdom that every one of your subjects
[1:33:47] in that Kingdom Naturally Speaking what
[1:33:50] if you had a kingdom that every one of
[1:33:51] you your subjects in that kingdom was a
[1:33:56] David they could kill a Lon a barar a
[1:34:01] giant you understand what I'm
[1:34:04] saying see we're the children of
[1:34:06] almighty
[1:34:07] God and we are the point to where that
[1:34:10] would be greater than David because
[1:34:12] David was just anointed we don't have
[1:34:16] just the
[1:34:17] anointing we have the Life of Christ
[1:34:21] thank you the one that guided That Rock
[1:34:23] in it right at that

[1:36:49] right let's all protect together
[1:37:02] together you can be seated for a
[1:37:05] moment till we get through and get
[1:37:08] everything
[1:37:13] ready you like to follow in the
[1:37:15] scriptures turn to
[1:37:16] John
[1:37:19] 13 begin with verse
[1:37:22] to and supper being ended the devil
[1:37:25] having now put into the heart of judas's
[1:37:27] carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus
[1:37:30] knowing that the father had given all
[1:37:32] things into his hands and that he was
[1:37:34] come from God and he went to God he
[1:37:37] rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:37:39] garments and took a towel and GED
[1:37:41] himself after that he poured water into
[1:37:44] a basin and begin to wash the disciples
[1:37:47] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:37:49] wherewith he was girded
[1:37:52] then cometh he to Simon Peter Peter said
[1:37:54] unto him Lord th th wash my feet Jesus
[1:37:59] answered and said unto him what I do
[1:38:01] thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know
[1:38:05] Hereafter Peter saith unto him you know
[1:38:07] it took a long time before Peter ever
[1:38:09] really come to that knowledge of what it
[1:38:12] was all about wasn't it and when he did
[1:38:14] then he said Lord I don't want to I
[1:38:16] don't want to even be hung on the cross
[1:38:19] the way my Lord was Hang Me Up di down
[1:38:22] he began to see all
[1:38:24] right and cometh he to Simon Peter and
[1:38:27] Peter Sith unto him Lord do thou wash my
[1:38:29] feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:38:31] what I do thou knowest not now but Thou
[1:38:33] shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him
[1:38:36] Thou shalt never wash my feet watch him
[1:38:39] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[1:38:42] thou Hast no part with
[1:38:44] me see that strong arrogant pet he's you
[1:38:48] ain't going to do that but when he he
[1:38:51] said if I don't wash you I no part do he
[1:38:56] and I like what he said because the two
[1:38:58] things that needs to be worh just watch
[1:39:00] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:39:03] feet only but my hands and my
[1:39:08] head that's the worst part right Jesus
[1:39:11] sath unto him he that is worh needeth
[1:39:13] not say to wash his feet but is clean
[1:39:16] every with and you're clean but not all
[1:39:19] for he knew who should betray him the
[1:39:21] for said he you are not all clean so
[1:39:24] after he had washed their feet and had
[1:39:26] taken his garments and would set down
[1:39:28] again he said unto them know you what I
[1:39:31] have done to you you call me master and
[1:39:34] Lord and you say well for so I am if I
[1:39:38] then your lord if I then your Lord and
[1:39:42] Master have washed your feet you also
[1:39:45] ought to wash one another's feet for
[1:39:47] I've given you an example that you
[1:39:49] should do as I have done to you verily
[1:39:51] verily I say unto you the servant is not
[1:39:54] greater than his Lord neither he that is
[1:39:57] sent greater than he that sent him if
