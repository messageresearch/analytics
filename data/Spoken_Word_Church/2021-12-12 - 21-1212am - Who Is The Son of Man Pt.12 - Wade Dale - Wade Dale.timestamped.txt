[20:56] the girls they're all singing and and
[20:58] they're learning the culture there and
[20:59] playing with parakeets and they're doing

[21:04] on whatsapp
[21:05] and then look on their facebook page
[21:07] you'll see all that also before we get
[21:10] started remember the people in mayfield

[21:57] announcing the rest of this pray for
[21:58] brother bob he's a brother andre's um
[22:01] preaching for them and remember the
[22:03] service next week
[22:05] all minds clear
[22:06] let's bow our heads just for a few
[22:08] moments speak to the author of the word
[22:10] the heavenly father we pray lord today
[22:12] that you would
[22:14] speak to us lord
[22:16] you've already spoke to us through song
[22:18] and the different things that we did
[22:20] lord
[22:21] we appreciate lord what everybody does
[22:23] in this church lord
[22:25] because we are truly
[22:27] the bride of jesus christ we are an
[22:29] exceptional group of people
[22:31] but we trust in you for everything that
[22:33] we do
[22:34] as brother john said we you give us 90
[22:37] of that money that we earn and we should
[22:39] be good stewards of that
[22:41] give our ten percent and then use the
[22:43] other wisely for the kingdom of god
[22:46] father we pray that you'd be with us now
[22:48] take care of us be with us in the
[22:49] furthermore the service bless the ones
[22:51] that are sick lord anna's family and
[22:52] enrich the lord being sick there at home
[22:55] all the different ones leah
[22:57] jim's dad
[22:58] remember him lord
[23:00] they're doing this therapy this week
[23:01] lord may get to go home in a week or so
[23:03] we pray should be with him lord
[23:05] just take care of each and every one of
[23:07] us lord the satan would love to destroy
[23:09] us he'd love to get rid of us but lord
[23:11] until you're finished with us he's not
[23:12] going to be able to touch us
[23:14] so father we pray that you'd be with us
[23:16] in this service take care of each one in
[23:17] jesus name
[23:19] amen
[23:20] let's finish let's continue on with who
[23:22] is this son of man we'll read john 1 1.
[23:25] in the beginning was the word word with
[23:28] god and the word was god
[23:30] the same was in the beginning with god
[23:32] all things were made by him and without
[23:34] him was not anything made
[23:36] that was made in him was life and life
[23:39] was the light of men
[23:40] and the light shineth in darkness and
[23:42] the darkness comprehended it not
[23:44] jesus told him before he left and we'll
[23:46] get to it a little bit later he said
[23:48] i'm coming back
[23:50] so you'll see me
[23:52] that the world will see me no more the
[23:54] world's not going to see the son of man
[23:55] until he's sitting in judgment
[23:58] amen we don't want to be that group of
[24:00] people
[24:02] to just see him in judgment we want to
[24:04] see him lor in the clouds
[24:06] when we get out of here right
[24:09] in him was life and the life was the
[24:11] light of men and the light shineth in
[24:12] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[24:14] it not there was a man sent from god
[24:16] whose name was john the same came for a
[24:18] witness to bear witness of the light
[24:20] that all men through him might believe
[24:22] he was not that light
[24:24] but he was sent to bear witness of that
[24:26] light
[24:27] that was the true light which led us
[24:29] every man that cometh into the world he
[24:31] was in the world the world was made by
[24:32] him and the world knew him not
[24:34] he came unto his own and his own
[24:36] received him not
[24:37] but as many as received them to them he
[24:39] gave he power
[24:41] excuse me to become the sons of god even
[24:43] to them that believe
[24:44] on his name which were born not a blood
[24:46] nor the will of the flesh
[24:48] look how john separates that nor of the
[24:50] will of man but of god
[24:52] and the word was made flesh
[24:54] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[24:56] glory as the glory of the only begotten
[24:57] of the father
[24:58] full of grace and truth let's read
[25:00] hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh
[25:02] into the world he saith sacrifice and
[25:04] offerings i would just not but a body
[25:07] has to have prepared me you may be
[25:09] seeing the lord that is blessing to the
[25:10] reading of the word i want to read you a
[25:12] little quote here on countdown
[25:14] they don't have this but that's okay i i
[25:16] thought about this and picked it up in
[25:18] the back
[25:19] so i believe that everything on earth
[25:21] reflects heaven
[25:23] i believe that because you see
[25:24] everything struggling for life is
[25:26] because there is a life that is
[25:27] reflected from
[25:29] see we wouldn't have anything refl to
[25:31] reflect
[25:32] from if god hadn't came here in human
[25:34] flesh
[25:35] all right that's my whole point and
[25:36] believe that when god made the man he
[25:39] started reflecting the smaller things
[25:41] such as the animal life then the next
[25:43] thing he created was something different
[25:46] that's just exactly the way bob the
[25:47] bible says he did it he made first the
[25:49] trees the botany life and he made man
[25:52] and then the last thing that ever come
[25:54] from the earth in the form of creation
[25:56] was a man
[25:58] nothing higher ever come
[26:00] because why here's my point it was a
[26:03] perfect reflection of the highest in
[26:05] heaven which
[26:06] god
[26:07] is a man
[26:10] see god is a man so therefore it proves
[26:13] it and when god came down to dwell among
[26:15] us he was a man
[26:17] the son of man
[26:19] god is a man
[26:21] a man so it shows that the perfection of
[26:23] evolution was god
[26:26] which is
[26:27] a man
[26:29] so this son of man that we're talking
[26:31] about
[26:32] we can read many things and we've been
[26:34] reading many things and we read this
[26:36] scripture where the word was made flesh
[26:38] and dwelt among us
[26:40] that word had to come that person had to
[26:43] come that was being made flesh he had to
[26:45] come according to the word we've heard
[26:46] that before but listen that's the same
[26:49] way you come you can't come any way
[26:51] contrary to the word of god
[26:53] you've got to come the same way
[26:56] you might have cried and this one
[26:58] shouted but you got the same thing if
[27:00] you got the the holy ghost you got the
[27:02] same person amen you got the same man
[27:05] all right that man come to you
[27:09] called jesus christ
[27:11] and he's the one that gave his life for
[27:12] you
[27:13] right
[27:14] so wherefore when he comes into the
[27:15] world he says sacrifice and often thou
[27:17] what it's not but a body thou has
[27:18] prepared me so i'm going to continue on
[27:20] through this
[27:21] on the masterpiece number one we see
[27:23] that brother brown says the body was
[27:25] built by the word which was the prophets
[27:27] and here comes the head of it all jesus
[27:29] came on the scene and i want to compile
[27:31] a few things how many times in the
[27:34] scriptures matthew mark luke and john
[27:36] that jesus was literally quoting the old
[27:38] testament
[27:39] word by word
[27:41] because he was that word he couldn't he
[27:43] couldn't misquote it
[27:45] but he looks at the people of the world
[27:47] of the religious people of the world
[27:49] that day and he says you're misquoting
[27:51] it
[27:53] because you've made your traditions
[27:56] the word
[27:57] and it's not
[27:59] that's what he was telling him right he
[28:00] said you you've made those traditions
[28:02] you've made them to where nobody can
[28:05] attain to this
[28:06] so we're nobody
[28:08] but remember as brother dale's always
[28:10] said the old testament
[28:12] and i'll read it to you a little bit
[28:13] later
[28:14] where jesus didn't come to do away with
[28:16] the law he had to come to fulfill the
[28:19] law
[28:20] and make it honorable
[28:22] in other words livable
[28:25] that's what this son of man come to do
[28:26] he come to make it so that you and i can
[28:28] sit in this church today
[28:30] and live
[28:31] what he lived
[28:33] he said oh no i can't do that well then
[28:35] you can't because you can't
[28:37] because he said be therefore perfect he
[28:39] said i am my father one and i want you
[28:41] and us to be one just as our father's
[28:43] one i want you to be with me i'll be
[28:45] with you even in you till then where's
[28:47] the separation part of this where's the
[28:49] part that we get all scrupled up that
[28:51] well i can't be this
[28:53] well i can't be that
[28:55] guess what we stop it ourself
[28:58] god will never stop you from being
[29:00] perfect
[29:02] but the world will tell you well i was
[29:04] born
[29:05] imperfect and i just am i just can't
[29:08] help what i do well yeah you can you get
[29:12] the helper inside of you and i'll
[29:14] promise you you'll quit the stupid
[29:15] things you're doing
[29:16] amen
[29:18] i mean we might do stupid human things
[29:19] but i'm talking about the
[29:21] crowsing and
[29:22] come not coming to church and doing all
[29:24] that i promise you you get the you get a
[29:26] born-again experience you don't have to
[29:28] preach about those things
[29:31] it's like brother dell's always said get
[29:33] them born again
[29:34] get them born again get that person
[29:36] inside of them and you don't have to
[29:37] preach to them
[29:39] you prove who you are
[29:41] by what's inside of you today
[29:45] this is the day of manifestation you're
[29:46] going to prove who you are
[29:49] the son of man proved who he was
[29:52] every day
[29:54] even in his natural life and we'll read
[29:56] it just a little while where his mother
[29:58] and they go to the to a wedding and and
[30:01] he turns water into wine
[30:03] he was you know he didn't get up he
[30:05] didn't get up that morning and go well i
[30:07] think i'm going to turn what no he just
[30:08] went with his mama to the
[30:10] to the wedding
[30:12] found out that the wine was gone
[30:15] and guess what
[30:17] he goes and turns the water into wine
[30:19] all right
[30:20] what about us like brother john's
[30:22] talking about even
[30:24] our financial life and
[30:26] it's kind of coordinated with our
[30:27] spiritual life somewhat
[30:29] but you have to be careful with that
[30:30] because
[30:32] you know job lost everything he had and
[30:33] he was a good guy
[30:35] but god restored him two-fold
[30:37] through the journey when his journey was
[30:39] over so we can't totally discredit that
[30:41] and we can't totally discredit that
[30:43] that
[30:44] the bible says lazarus
[30:46] was a beggar remember when he was in the
[30:49] bosom of abraham he was a beggar and he
[30:50] was poor so just be careful with that we
[30:53] need to
[30:54] we can be the richest people in the
[30:55] world financially and be dead is all get
[30:57] out in our spiritual life
[30:59] amen
[31:01] but it doesn't hurt to have both have a
[31:03] good spiritual life and a good financial
[31:05] life so i enjoy that that's really good
[31:07] brother john i
[31:08] like i said before you had some snitches
[31:10] that told that you had some more of that
[31:12] left so
[31:13] that's why you
[31:15] but he did a good job though a real good
[31:17] job
[31:21] that's why i think you know a good
[31:22] established church has got people that
[31:24] when if one can't be here another one
[31:26] steps right in
[31:28] and don't miss a lick
[31:30] don't miss a lick you just step right in
[31:31] and do the job this one can't do this
[31:33] and this one steps right in and does the
[31:34] job
[31:36] listen our training has to come from
[31:38] within
[31:40] amen our training when you've got a call
[31:42] in your life it comes from inside it
[31:44] doesn't come from external things
[31:46] remember what brother brown said daddy
[31:47] called him mama saying we don't want to
[31:49] be a preacher this daddy called him mama
[31:50] said
[31:51] we want to have god
[31:53] that called us
[31:55] and then it made mom and dad a little
[31:57] bit happier
[31:59] amen
[32:00] but we still have to live this life it's
[32:02] like brother john read the quote you
[32:03] know brother brown said if you were
[32:04] building a house
[32:06] and you knew the lord was coming
[32:07] continuing to build the house let's
[32:09] don't be let's don't be nuts because of
[32:11] that let's don't let's don't take it to
[32:13] the extreme
[32:14] we've seen that in the past
[32:16] that did happen brother john years ago
[32:18] these people run up all these debts
[32:20] because the lord was coming in 1977 so
[32:23] they just run up all this kind of debt
[32:25] guess what they still got the debt
[32:29] because you know it's what it's what
[32:30] you're thinking what you think in your
[32:32] heart
[32:34] that's what god knows he knows what you
[32:36] think in your heart doesn't matter what
[32:38] you portray everywhere else
[32:39] it's what you
[32:40] god knows in your heart
[32:42] okay
[32:43] i don't know where that came from but
[32:45] god bless you for that
[32:47] but anyway so but a body was built by
[32:50] the word which was the prophets and here
[32:51] comes the head of it all jesus came on
[32:54] the scene so you got pieces over here
[32:56] pieces over here i was trying to you
[32:58] know there's a thing in brother dale
[33:00] study that that shows a bible flipping
[33:03] open and as the bible's flipping open
[33:06] jesus is stepping out of the bible
[33:08] as the pages come up like this jesus
[33:10] comes up and there's an image of him
[33:12] walking out of the bible that's
[33:14] literally what he done
[33:16] he literally walked out of the word of
[33:18] god now see if if that's our example
[33:20] though
[33:22] come on people if that's our example
[33:25] when you and i get born again we should
[33:27] the same image should come as the words
[33:29] being opened and unfolded
[33:32] then it should be you stepping out of
[33:34] those pages
[33:40] amen
[33:42] you say oh that's for jesus
[33:45] i thought he'd come here to give it to
[33:46] you
[33:48] i don't want people to throw that in my
[33:50] face well that was just for jesus i
[33:52] thought he said
[33:53] everything's been given to me
[33:55] and i'm going to give it to you
[33:57] even paul picks it up and says heirs and
[33:59] joint heirs
[34:00] we get the same thing jesus gets
[34:03] amen
[34:04] because listen it's the same spirit
[34:06] dwells in us that dwells in him guess
[34:08] what we're gonna have a quickening we're
[34:10] gonna have a resurrection i'll promise
[34:12] you that
[34:14] but this baby had to get here and this
[34:15] is the time of the year
[34:17] that the people think that um
[34:19] that baby jesus was born well we know
[34:20] it's not
[34:22] and there's many arguments about that
[34:23] but
[34:24] we know lambs are born in april the
[34:26] prophet of god told us
[34:28] but we enjoy this time of the year
[34:29] because
[34:30] most of the time people are happy this
[34:32] time of the year
[34:33] thank goodness for just maybe a couple
[34:35] of days that people are happy amen
[34:38] same way with us
[34:39] and we give gifts and we get gifts
[34:42] all these people that don't want to
[34:44] celebrate christmas that's okay that's
[34:45] all right you do what you need to do
[34:48] luke 1 30 says behold thou shalt
[34:50] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[34:51] son and shall call his name jesus
[34:54] and we know that was a
[34:56] angel coming to mary
[34:59] look at number two
[35:00] and he fit every gift
[35:02] that's what we were talking about last
[35:03] sunday
[35:04] when the when the three wise men came to
[35:07] jesus they had three gifts and brother
[35:09] brown said that totally
[35:11] applied to everything in his life gold
[35:13] frankincense and myrrh
[35:15] and the same thing with me and you when
[35:16] you and i are born again i believe we
[35:18] get gifts
[35:23] do you use them
[35:26] because it's in that book that the pages
[35:28] it opens that's you
[35:30] now see i can't sing worth a lick or
[35:32] play a guitar but some of y'all can
[35:35] and some of y'all try not to
[35:38] that can
[35:39] you need to use your gift
[35:41] cause that's what god came as a man to
[35:43] give us these gifts
[35:45] as the three wise men wise men
[35:49] brought gifts gold frankincense and
[35:51] myrrh deity dedicated to death
[35:54] he was dedicated to die for me and you
[35:58] i like this next one down here at the
[35:59] bottom
[36:01] he wasn't nothing less than god
[36:03] he was god manifested in flesh he was
[36:05] the creator in his own creation
[36:08] he was the creator in his own creation
[36:11] by the creation for the creation
[36:15] so when gabriel came and told mary see
[36:18] listen gabriel was the messenger gabriel
[36:19] wasn't one that planted the
[36:21] no god did god created the egg in the in
[36:24] the sperm placed it in mary everybody
[36:27] got that we know that
[36:28] but it was he was created his own self
[36:33] which makes him in a few minutes the
[36:36] beginning of the creation of god i hope
[36:38] we understand that because you know what
[36:39] there's a continuation of that creation
[36:44] was there not a continuation of the
[36:46] creation
[36:48] if he's the beginning
[36:49] there's got to be
[36:51] more to come
[36:53] amen
[36:55] so now and he was being he was a being
[36:57] on earth a being of time which means
[36:59] that he must have had a beginning
[37:01] therefore he created himself a body to
[37:03] live in god himself created a body for
[37:06] himself that by this creation
[37:10] he might save the lost creation that he
[37:12] created
[37:14] amen
[37:15] now look at number three
[37:18] who was this man jehovah
[37:20] lying crying like a baby can you imagine
[37:22] it
[37:23] we talked about it last weekend or last
[37:26] week that or week before last
[37:28] how that baby was god almighty in human
[37:32] flesh no less god amen no more god he
[37:35] was god almighty and human flesh and we
[37:37] know that in revelations 3 verse 14
[37:42] this is to me and you and to the angel
[37:43] of the church the layout of sins these
[37:44] things saith the amen the faithful and
[37:46] true witness
[37:47] the beginning of the creation of god as
[37:49] we talked about before
[37:52] i believe this is the way god wanted it
[37:55] to be had there not been a fall
[37:57] you can think of it any way you want to
[37:59] but remember god when we were talking
[38:01] about
[38:02] eternal redemption there's a thread and
[38:05] god can't get away from that threat he
[38:06] used he has to be he's consistent
[38:09] thank god he's consistent
[38:10] [Music]
[38:12] everything he does over here has got a
[38:14] purpose and it's going to happen over
[38:15] here because you and i were supposed to
[38:17] be born without sex then we're
[38:20] born again without sex right
[38:23] we're born again without that desire
[38:25] born again not born of flesh as john was
[38:27] talking about but born of the spirit of
[38:28] god that's why jesus said you must be
[38:30] born from above everybody okay with that
[38:33] but but here's the beginning of the
[38:34] creation of god and we're a continuation
[38:37] of that creation
[38:39] and when and now here's a here's a baby
[38:42] being born
[38:43] and then he has to grow up like we're
[38:45] talking about he has to grow up
[38:47] but now he doesn't manifest that
[38:50] beginning of the creation of god the way
[38:53] he wants to until when
[38:55] until he dies
[38:57] because the bible said he had to die
[39:00] to what
[39:01] isaiah 53 he gave his soul a ransom so
[39:04] he could see his seed so when he gave a
[39:06] soul a ransom he came back on the day of
[39:08] pentecost there's when that rest of that
[39:10] part of that creation began to unfold
[39:15] peter james john 120 3 000
[39:19] that's when he really manifested who he
[39:21] was but he had to be an example
[39:24] for that 30 years that he was alive 33
[39:27] years he was alive
[39:28] he had to be the example the prime
[39:30] example so that's why we have to go back
[39:32] to that example every time if we don't
[39:35] go to the if we get away from that
[39:36] example
[39:38] i was telling brother richard hyatt and
[39:39] him this
[39:40] weekend we look at the example in and
[39:44] not saying
[39:46] here we go again not saying anything bad
[39:48] about people that don't see the truth
[39:50] but
[39:52] we're the only people
[39:54] that can make this bible live
[39:56] to its 100
[39:58] truth like jesus did
[40:01] because you take you take this
[40:03] denomination over here they say well
[40:05] we're going to take a father son holy
[40:06] ghost baptism well see you've already
[40:08] tore
[40:09] you tore a piece of the son of man off
[40:11] amen
[40:14] god winks at the ignorance of that but
[40:16] that's not the fullness
[40:17] because it's been torn off like we're
[40:19] going to read here in a minute where
[40:20] jesus was handed a scroll
[40:24] a book
[40:25] which they didn't have books back then
[40:26] they'd scroll he rolled the scroll was
[40:28] rolled up and it was handed to jesus he
[40:30] unfolded it read it folded it back up
[40:32] and handed it back to the to the priest
[40:34] that's exactly what he done with his
[40:36] time here on earth
[40:38] he came here to open himself up to
[40:40] reveal himself
[40:42] and for everybody to read about him
[40:46] because all he had to do was read the
[40:47] old testament
[40:49] he came exactly that way he didn't miss
[40:51] it by one
[40:53] one sentence one word
[40:56] he was the very word made manifest
[40:59] so why can't you and i
[41:01] if we got that same guy in us
[41:04] it's that memory reason conscious
[41:05] affection it's that spirit realm that we
[41:06] have a problem with we all know that and
[41:09] that's the part we need to work on
[41:12] you listen let that soul out and let it
[41:14] live i don't care if it's even evil
[41:17] at least let it out
[41:19] quit pretending
[41:21] let it out
[41:23] you know what if you let it out then god
[41:24] can do something about it but if you
[41:26] don't let it out
[41:28] god cannot do anything for you
[41:31] amen
[41:33] but you gotta let it out
[41:36] jesus did he let it out
[41:38] he gave his soul a ransom
[41:41] for me and you
[41:44] he died
[41:45] so that we don't have to sure we see
[41:47] physical death but i promise you if
[41:49] you're born again today you'll never die
[41:51] that's what jesus was talking about he
[41:52] said you'll never die he said you drink
[41:54] of this water and you eat of this bread
[41:56] and we'll get into those things those
[41:58] symbols a little bit later on but he
[42:00] stood up one day and he said unless you
[42:01] eat my flesh and drink my blood he said
[42:03] you'll have no problem
[42:05] now it took a revelation to figure that
[42:07] out
[42:08] and we got that revelation because we
[42:09] know what that is we partake we're
[42:11] partaking right now
[42:13] the prophet of god
[42:14] tells us we're we're feeding and that's
[42:16] later on in the message we're feeding on
[42:18] the body word of what not the son of god
[42:22] the son of man
[42:24] because that man had a body
[42:28] and we can see that body listen by faith
[42:30] you ought to be able to see that body we
[42:32] know that brother branham saw him uh up
[42:35] in a a cloud or in a vision we know that
[42:37] but you and i should be able to say
[42:39] that's exactly the truth
[42:41] ain't nothing but the truth so that's
[42:43] what he looks like he looks like that
[42:46] almost to that he said
[42:48] so that's what we're looking at
[42:50] all right now look luke 2 verse 39 says
[42:52] oh this person see child grew and
[42:54] whacked strong in spirit filled with
[42:56] wisdom
[42:57] and the grace of god was upon him
[43:00] skip on down a little further and
[43:02] when he was 12 years old
[43:04] they went to jerusalem after the custom
[43:06] of the feast and i'll just paraphrase
[43:08] this just for a minute what they did was
[43:10] remember they lost him
[43:12] they left a 12 year old boy
[43:15] alone
[43:17] but there was a purpose behind every bit
[43:18] of that amen because what did jesus do
[43:22] see their problem was they went to the
[43:23] feast of passover probably maybe just to
[43:25] eat or just to kill one you know once
[43:28] once you had the the sacrifice killed
[43:30] you were done you didn't have to do
[43:31] anything else
[43:33] right you could just going back to the
[43:34] house well they were going on back to
[43:36] the house
[43:37] but listen
[43:39] where'd jesus go he went to the
[43:41] church
[43:43] he went to church and he went to church
[43:45] and he was asking them questions but
[43:47] remember watch this
[43:49] in same way in mind in your journey as
[43:51] far as being christians
[43:53] we're going to go from baby form
[43:56] to adoption
[43:58] because we've got to get to mount
[43:59] transfiguration and we'll get to it at
[44:01] the very end of the
[44:02] service here
[44:04] where he went up and was transfigured
[44:06] and god said here you him
[44:09] now listen it wasn't that you're not
[44:10] supposed to hear him over here
[44:12] but he was given the authority of that
[44:14] person
[44:16] to the world so the world can see it i
[44:18] like what brother brown said one time he
[44:20] said
[44:21] this message
[44:23] was not hidden in the corner
[44:25] this message went around the world seven
[44:27] times
[44:28] this message was vindicated
[44:34] and the whole world saw it
[44:37] same way with jesus folks listen he the
[44:39] everybody now we know the whole world
[44:41] didn't see him we know you know there
[44:42] wasn't television at that time but still
[44:45] the whole world that was around him was
[44:46] supposed to be able to see him and they
[44:48] did not see who he was so they're not
[44:50] going to see who you are listen if you
[44:51] and i was telling them this past weekend
[44:55] odd people i like the
[44:58] sermon brother brown preached called
[45:00] oddball
[45:02] because we are odd to the world
[45:05] you go walk through the world
[45:08] and you don't do the things they do
[45:11] and you think in your mind they crazy
[45:15] well they thinking and they mind you
[45:16] crazy
[45:20] so that's okay
[45:22] i like what brother brown said that sign
[45:23] on that
[45:24] said i'm a fool for christ and then he
[45:26] said the sign on the back said whose
[45:28] fool are you
[45:30] the man you're either gonna be a fool
[45:31] for the devil or fool for god so i think
[45:33] i'll just be a fool for god
[45:35] amen
[45:38] but jesus was always misunderstood
[45:41] anybody
[45:43] that lives so close to god like brother
[45:45] branham did was so totally misunderstood
[45:50] amen
[45:52] brother dale is one of the most
[45:53] misunderstood people in the message just
[45:55] telling you
[45:56] right erin everybody's everybody's
[45:58] talked to people they don't can't
[45:59] understand him they don't know what he's
[46:00] talking about
[46:02] he never bothered me none
[46:05] you know because i said lord fill my cup
[46:07] i'm going to open my cup up
[46:09] let me have some of that
[46:11] don't make me scared of it a lot of
[46:12] people are scared of this thing don't be
[46:14] scared of it
[46:16] it's for you it's the children's bread
[46:18] it's that gift that you've got
[46:22] amen
[46:24] it's the gift
[46:25] it's been given listen we give gifts at
[46:28] christmas time right
[46:31] now wait a minute
[46:32] you give a gift and expect one in return
[46:37] i'm going to close my eyes because some
[46:38] of you are going to say yup
[46:40] i don't know who you are
[46:42] if you give a gift back to return it's
[46:44] not a gift
[46:45] it's like brother john it's like a loan
[46:48] dave ramsey always tells you you know he
[46:49] says turkey dinner tastes a lot
[46:51] different at thanksgiving if your kids
[46:53] owe you money
[46:55] or if you owe your mom and daddy money
[46:57] so the best thing to do is just give it
[46:59] to them it's a gift if they pay you back
[47:02] surprise
[47:06] that's the same way with god he's not
[47:07] going to give you a gift and then expect
[47:09] you know what the only thing he's going
[47:10] to expect use it
[47:12] he's going to expect you to use it if he
[47:14] gives it to you use it now we know that
[47:16] people like elvis presley look brother
[47:18] brown said he had a gift
[47:20] he had an anointing
[47:22] he could have sent millions of souls to
[47:24] heaven
[47:25] but
[47:26] instead he
[47:27] took money and popularity and sent
[47:29] millions of people to hell
[47:31] that's the fine line
[47:33] so god gives you a gift folks you need
[47:35] to use it
[47:36] amen and use it for the glory of god
[47:39] let that thing out let use it
[47:42] but they found him in the temple
[47:45] but remember
[47:46] when he was 12 years old which we've
[47:48] already discussed that a little bit i
[47:49] want to cover this for a second i was
[47:52] thinking about it in in kentucky the
[47:54] other day
[47:57] you've got two scenarios jesus in the
[47:59] temple at 12.
[48:01] now watch your life
[48:02] jesus in the temple at 12 and jesus into
[48:06] in the temple at 30
[48:07] or 31ish
[48:09] everybody got that there's there's
[48:11] in right here in luke 2 verse 39 then
[48:14] over in luke 4 he's growed up and he's
[48:16] now he's in the temple again
[48:19] there's two different scenarios
[48:21] this scenario
[48:22] what was he doing
[48:24] and it came to pass that after three
[48:26] days they found him in the temple
[48:27] sitting in the midst of the doctors both
[48:30] hearing them and asking them questions
[48:34] okay
[48:35] god asking questions
[48:38] yeah that's what it says jesus was
[48:40] asking them questions
[48:42] and all that heard him were astonished
[48:45] at his understanding and his answers
[48:48] but that didn't convert nobody
[48:51] but now you come over here to luke 4 and
[48:53] we'll read that a little bit later on in
[48:54] luke 4 there's some authority comes into
[48:57] being
[48:58] there's some maturity comes into being
[49:00] he's not in just the temple sitting in
[49:02] the corner no he's sitting on the front
[49:04] row
[49:05] actually he's probably sitting
[49:08] somewhere in a seat he's done made it up
[49:10] to this part this section
[49:12] that he can be handed a scroll and what
[49:14] they heard him say they listened to him
[49:17] same way with me and you
[49:20] you and i must have authority
[49:23] now listen
[49:25] brother dale and i were talking about
[49:26] this the other day power without
[49:27] character satanic
[49:29] okay but we we we stopped there and go
[49:32] okay power without character satanic no
[49:34] read the rest of the quote
[49:36] but power with character is fit to rule
[49:41] and that's why god had he had power with
[49:44] character
[49:45] so listen if he can have power with
[49:47] character so can you
[49:51] that's the gifts the statue of a perfect
[49:53] man he's given these things to you what
[49:55] are you doing with it
[49:57] he's giving you a christmas gift what
[49:58] are you doing with it
[49:59] amen
[50:02] so in other words jesus said must i be
[50:05] about my father's business
[50:07] he understood not what he was saying see
[50:09] even the people around even his own mama
[50:11] and father and brother brown said she
[50:13] denied the virgin birth by saying me and
[50:14] your daddy
[50:16] all right and so that just solidified
[50:17] with a lot of people around him that he
[50:19] was joseph's daddy
[50:21] right
[50:23] if you heard the mother say your father
[50:25] and i have sought you diligently right
[50:30] because we see over in luke 4 when he
[50:32] when this scenario happens in luke 4
[50:34] somebody steps up and goes is that
[50:37] joseph's boy
[50:40] isn't that joseph's boy
[50:41] no that ain't joseph's boy if he's been
[50:43] about his father's business he'd been in
[50:45] a carpenter shop
[50:47] hebrews 5 8 says yet learn he obedience
[50:50] by the things which he suffered and
[50:52] being made perfect he became the author
[50:55] of eternal salvation and all them that
[50:56] obey him we couldn't understand god
[50:58] without jesus christ being here there's
[51:01] no way to understand
[51:03] anything
[51:04] look at the old testament they didn't
[51:05] understand any of it they just knew to
[51:09] bow and
[51:10] go every seven days and
[51:12] kill this lamb and
[51:14] do this and don't do that
[51:17] amen
[51:18] but that ain't what that was about
[51:20] right
[51:22] but we had a promise in matthew 3 verse
[51:24] 11
[51:26] that says he shall baptize you with the
[51:28] holy ghost and with fire
[51:30] so we know that there's something going
[51:31] to happen
[51:33] jesus is going to have to be
[51:35] washed
[51:37] we see this is john
[51:40] have you ever took everything that john
[51:42] said now john only said a few things in
[51:43] the bible
[51:45] but if you can't put that brother
[51:46] branham's the same way
[51:49] he comes out of the wilderness how many
[51:50] times did brother brown
[51:52] tell you about john and you're going
[51:55] that happened to you brother brown
[51:58] you come out of the wilderness you love
[51:59] the wilderness
[52:02] you're not you're against all them
[52:03] people
[52:06] and you preach marriage in divorce
[52:08] you hate bad women
[52:10] amen
[52:13] and he introduced
[52:15] the son of man
[52:17] branham introduced to the world the son
[52:20] of man
[52:22] john the baptist introduced to the world
[52:24] the son of man amen
[52:27] john introduced the head so is the
[52:29] prophet of god in the end time that's
[52:30] why i believe he was so important
[52:32] not only for all the other things to put
[52:34] everything back together but he brought
[52:36] the headstone back where it could sit on
[52:37] the building
[52:38] and be a complete pyramid amen
[52:41] so let's read this right here
[52:43] continue right here real quick
[52:47] let's go to verse 15. brothers and jesus
[52:50] answered and said suffer it to be so now
[52:52] for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[52:54] righteousness then in other words he
[52:55] baptized him remember jesus didn't need
[52:57] to be baptized
[52:59] but you and i do
[53:00] all right but it's a symbol of him
[53:02] washing the sacrifice and jesus when he
[53:05] was baptized went straight away out of
[53:06] the water and lo the heavens were opened
[53:08] unto him and he saw the spirit of god
[53:10] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[53:11] him and low a voice from heaven saying
[53:13] this is my beloved son in whom i am well
[53:15] pleased you and i at the same time not
[53:18] when our baptism listen your baptism
[53:20] doesn't save you
[53:24] your confession to god is what saves you
[53:27] the baptism is just a good conscience to
[53:29] tell the world that hey
[53:31] in other words
[53:32] i'm being washed
[53:35] when i was literally baptized
[53:38] in 1997
[53:42] cold day in january
[53:46] when i come out of the water
[53:49] i felt like there wasn't anything inside
[53:50] of me
[53:53] i just cried
[53:54] grabbed hold of june and cried cause
[53:56] that's all i knew to do i was so empty
[53:58] my thoughts were empty
[54:00] i wasn't i wasn't condemned with what i
[54:02] had done previously
[54:05] now wait a minute later on he came and
[54:07] did that but at that moment of time
[54:09] there was something around me
[54:11] that that kept that out of the way
[54:14] amen you know what it was
[54:16] i had done what god told me to do
[54:19] and then when you do what god told you
[54:21] to tells you to do you can point back at
[54:23] the word and say lord you said if i'd
[54:25] get baptized the correct way
[54:28] that you'd give me the holy ghost
[54:30] so about six months later he gave me the
[54:32] holy ghost
[54:33] amen
[54:35] you go by the prescribed way that god
[54:38] does it
[54:39] and he'll have to give it to you
[54:42] brother brown said take him at his word
[54:45] because he is the word if you take him
[54:47] as the word that's him and who is coming
[54:49] to you at the new birth the person of
[54:51] jesus christ
[54:52] inside of you
[54:54] as the holy ghost everybody got that
[54:56] right
[54:57] all right
[54:58] so now let's go where brother brown says
[55:01] i love this quote in the future home
[55:02] number five
[55:03] brother brown says this is my part of
[55:05] the earth in other words when jesus came
[55:07] out of the water
[55:08] john saw that dove coming down or the
[55:11] form of a dove and a voice saying this
[55:12] is my part of the earth that i have
[55:14] redeemed
[55:15] and from this part of the earth i will
[55:17] redeem the rest of it why he came from
[55:21] here
[55:26] his body was created it was 16 elements
[55:28] it was just like ours
[55:31] but it settled on a person that could
[55:35] redeem
[55:37] you and i
[55:38] were born in sin
[55:41] born right out of this soil that we're
[55:42] standing on
[55:44] amen
[55:46] but by the transforming power of the new
[55:48] birth
[55:52] we accept that part that jesus did for
[55:54] us
[55:56] and this is my part of the earth that i
[55:57] have redeemed and from this part of the
[55:59] earth i will redeem wade dale
[56:03] you got to put your name in there
[56:05] i will redeem the rest of it for he is
[56:07] my word made manifest so what does that
[56:09] make you that makes you the word made
[56:11] manifest and the whole world i spoke
[56:13] into existence by my word hebrews 11.
[56:16] and satan has held it all this time but
[56:18] i've come to redeem it so much of it has
[56:20] made his body and i'm coming to dwell
[56:23] in it let's go to luke 4
[56:25] verse 1.
[56:27] we read this a couple weeks ago but
[56:28] we're going to read it again luke 4
[56:30] verse 1 says in jesus being full of the
[56:33] holy ghost now this is right after the
[56:35] baptism
[56:36] and listen we know that jesus didn't
[56:38] need the holy ghost he was the holy
[56:40] ghost
[56:41] he was if he was the fullness of the
[56:42] godhead bodily fullness
[56:45] full
[56:47] fullness of the godhead bodily which is
[56:48] what father son and holy ghost amen
[56:51] then he had all those three attributes
[56:53] he was all those three attributes but he
[56:56] had to receive an anointing to go preach
[56:58] his message and that anointing was the
[57:00] holy ghost
[57:03] you know brother brown could stand and
[57:04] preach
[57:05] preach under the inspiration of the holy
[57:07] ghost give us revelation and preach to
[57:09] us for a couple hours
[57:11] under an anointing and then he said he'd
[57:13] have to switch gears
[57:16] now folks
[57:18] he didn't call another holy ghost
[57:21] to come help him
[57:25] i mean come on
[57:26] but he moved over into another anointing
[57:29] of the same holy ghost
[57:31] so he could discern and heal not him
[57:34] heal the sick so that god can heal the
[57:35] sick but it's the same holy ghost it
[57:37] wasn't that he had to had to get him
[57:39] another one
[57:40] so jesus being the full of the holy
[57:42] ghost
[57:43] was the holy ghost
[57:45] he got an anointing of the holy ghost
[57:50] to preach the message he listen when he
[57:53] was 12 and 13 in that temple he didn't
[57:55] say a word except asking questions
[57:59] and talking to those people
[58:01] but watch here in luke 4 verse 1. jesus
[58:03] being full of the holy ghost returned
[58:05] from jordan
[58:06] and was led by the spirit into the
[58:07] wilderness
[58:08] being 40 days we we saw this before but
[58:11] watch what happened look at verse 4 he
[58:13] says it is written
[58:15] now let's go to verse 8
[58:17] verse 8 it says it is written jesus is
[58:20] quoting him scripture quoting him
[58:22] scripture quoting him scripture
[58:24] now look at number 12.
[58:26] he finally took all he can take and
[58:28] jesus answered and said unto him it is
[58:29] said
[58:31] not written
[58:33] it is said
[58:35] in other words i'm telling you devil and
[58:37] there was something that satan felt not
[58:39] with the other two because he just kept
[58:41] coming back he just kept coming back but
[58:44] when jesus looked at him and said hey
[58:45] buddy it's sad i'm telling you
[58:48] i'm telling you
[58:52] thou shalt not tempt the lord
[58:55] thy god
[58:57] and satan left him but now remember he
[58:59] only departed him for a season
[59:01] satan is very persistent
[59:03] i wish we were as persistent as he was
[59:06] amen
[59:07] luke 4 verse 16 we got to continue with
[59:09] this journey and he came to nazareth
[59:11] where he had been brought up and as his
[59:12] custom was he went to church
[59:15] on the sabbath day and stood up for the
[59:16] read so see now he's standing up and
[59:18] reading now he's getting some authority
[59:22] but what is he doing
[59:23] and there was delivered unto him the
[59:25] book of the prophet isaiah
[59:29] now remember
[59:31] they didn't have
[59:32] books they had scrolls
[59:35] everybody with me
[59:36] wake up a minute
[59:39] scrolls they had scrolls
[59:41] now that scroll
[59:42] was handed to jesus
[59:45] and what jesus do with it he knew what
[59:47] to do with it because he was a word
[59:49] what's the first thing he did
[59:53] can you read those words in there for me
[59:56] can you read them
[59:58] why
[59:59] oh well but when it's open can you not
[1:00:01] read that
[1:00:02] okay
[1:00:04] so that's what jesus did
[1:00:06] he opened the book
[1:00:08] now watch
[1:00:10] can you and i do the same thing
[1:00:14] because we've been given now not a
[1:00:17] closed book
[1:00:19] we've been given an open book
[1:00:21] we were handed this seven seal book with
[1:00:23] the sales off of it yes
[1:00:26] so that we can read what exactly is
[1:00:28] being done now he looks and when he
[1:00:29] opened the book
[1:00:31] he found the place where it was written
[1:00:33] in other words he found a place where he
[1:00:34] was
[1:00:37] it really about anybody else about moses
[1:00:41] read about himself
[1:00:44] now i didn't bring this quote but i
[1:00:46] quoted it to him in in kentucky last
[1:00:49] week
[1:00:50] and i'll bring it to you if you need it
[1:00:51] but all you gotta do is put in greatest
[1:00:53] anointing
[1:00:54] the prophet of god said the greatest
[1:00:56] anointing to ever hit the earth
[1:00:59] was not the first day of creation
[1:01:01] was not the day he created adam
[1:01:04] was not the day he became a baby
[1:01:13] it wasn't a shout in time brother brown
[1:01:14] said i believe the quote says he they're
[1:01:16] not they weren't walking on the walls
[1:01:20] he said the greatest anointing to ever
[1:01:21] strike the earth
[1:01:23] was when jesus sat down and opened the
[1:01:25] book
[1:01:26] he found his self
[1:01:29] in the bible
[1:01:31] see that should be your greatest
[1:01:32] anointing if you can find yourself in
[1:01:34] the bible how in the world can satan
[1:01:37] how can he do anything with you if you
[1:01:38] can find yourself in the bible
[1:01:41] and say satan do like brother um
[1:01:44] um not brother maloney but brother
[1:01:46] schrader he said satan if you're going
[1:01:48] to play in my mind you're going to look
[1:01:49] through my eyes we're going to read the
[1:01:51] bible
[1:01:52] and that means something because how
[1:01:54] many times has the devil said oh you
[1:01:55] don't need to read that
[1:01:56] i don't need to read that yeah we're
[1:01:58] going to read that
[1:02:01] and when he had opened the book he found
[1:02:02] the place where it was written so he had
[1:02:03] he opened the book
[1:02:05] the son of man opened the book
[1:02:09] and he said the spirit of the lord is
[1:02:11] upon me
[1:02:13] pretty personal
[1:02:14] he didn't say us upon you
[1:02:17] he said the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:02:18] me
[1:02:21] because he hath anointed me
[1:02:24] to preach the gospel
[1:02:25] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:02:29] to preach deliverance to the captive and
[1:02:30] recovering of the sight of the blind to
[1:02:32] say that liberty them that are bruised
[1:02:35] to preach the acceptable
[1:02:37] year of the lord now that scripture he
[1:02:39] stopped mid-scripture
[1:02:42] because that pertained to his second
[1:02:43] coming
[1:02:45] he knew where to stop and he knew where
[1:02:47] to start
[1:02:48] how about me and you
[1:02:53] and he closed the book back up
[1:02:59] and he handed it back to the rabbi
[1:03:02] and i'm sure the old rabbi is like
[1:03:05] what's he fishing to say now
[1:03:10] what'd he say
[1:03:11] he said this day
[1:03:14] this scripture
[1:03:19] is fulfilled
[1:03:21] in your ears
[1:03:25] listen the son of man opened the book
[1:03:28] the son of man read where he was at in
[1:03:30] the book
[1:03:31] and then he closed the book back up and
[1:03:33] never opened it back again until the end
[1:03:35] time
[1:03:38] revelations 10 1
[1:03:40] mighty angel comes down with the book
[1:03:42] now remember it's not a book it's a
[1:03:43] scroll
[1:03:45] and it was open
[1:03:47] the seventh angel when he introduced the
[1:03:49] son of man that's the problem was they
[1:03:51] thought brother branham was the son of
[1:03:52] man no he was introducing the son of man
[1:03:54] just like john
[1:03:56] because they even asked even jesus said
[1:03:58] who do you say i am they say oh you john
[1:03:59] the baptist look how close that was
[1:04:02] he wasn't john the baptist
[1:04:05] john the baptist was close to him
[1:04:07] that's why they couldn't separate him
[1:04:09] saying we were brother brad but when
[1:04:10] that book got closed back up look he
[1:04:12] closed the book back
[1:04:13] gave it to the minister and sat down and
[1:04:15] the eyes of all them in the synagogue
[1:04:17] were fastened on him
[1:04:18] he began to say this day
[1:04:21] is this scripture
[1:04:22] fulfilled
[1:04:24] in your ears
[1:04:26] your ears
[1:04:28] john 5 verse 25 says look very verily i
[1:04:31] say unto you the hour is coming and now
[1:04:33] is when the dead shall hear the voice of
[1:04:35] the son of god now watch
[1:04:37] hear the voice of the son of god and
[1:04:40] they that hear him shall live
[1:04:41] for as the father has life in himself
[1:04:44] so has he given to the son
[1:04:47] of man
[1:04:50] because listen the voice of the
[1:04:52] resurrection is the son of man
[1:04:55] who stood at lazarus tomb
[1:04:57] the son of man
[1:04:58] the son of man stood at lazarus tomb and
[1:05:00] said i am the resurrection and the life
[1:05:04] but remember it was the son of god that
[1:05:06] was inside that man
[1:05:09] that at that time had the authority
[1:05:12] you got to be careful with that because
[1:05:13] listen why did jesus one day he said now
[1:05:15] if you speak against the son of man
[1:05:17] you're okay you can curse him and
[1:05:20] whatever you want to do because that's
[1:05:21] how that's how peter got out of it i
[1:05:23] mean he didn't get out of it but
[1:05:24] you understand how peter got by with
[1:05:26] cursing
[1:05:28] he said but
[1:05:29] when the holy ghost has come
[1:05:31] when the son of god comes inside of that
[1:05:34] person
[1:05:35] and said you speak against him he said
[1:05:37] you're not speaking against him you're
[1:05:38] speaking against me
[1:05:40] and he said that'll never be forgiven
[1:05:42] you see the dispensation the
[1:05:43] dispensation changes now that's why now
[1:05:46] even we're going to read it not tonight
[1:05:48] today but a little bit later on where
[1:05:50] jesus said the son of man has power to
[1:05:52] forgive sins
[1:05:53] power on earth
[1:05:55] to forgive sins
[1:05:58] they said brother branham you forgive
[1:06:00] those people their sins he said that's
[1:06:01] not too far off
[1:06:04] right
[1:06:06] what do you say when i forgive you when
[1:06:08] somebody does something to you
[1:06:11] when somebody does something to you have
[1:06:13] you got the authority to say i forgive
[1:06:15] you and then god honors that i believe
[1:06:17] so
[1:06:19] i believe so
[1:06:20] i believe god honors that if you're
[1:06:22] truly
[1:06:23] born again and truly in the word of god
[1:06:27] then you absolutely because even if we
[1:06:29] praise somebody how many people have
[1:06:30] been healed
[1:06:32] oh my
[1:06:33] almost 100
[1:06:35] how many people have been healed guess
[1:06:37] what the bible says
[1:06:39] lay hands on sickness shall recover
[1:06:41] then the scripture tells us if they have
[1:06:44] any sin
[1:06:45] do you read that part
[1:06:48] they will be forgiven also
[1:06:51] wow
[1:06:52] because somebody's praying for you
[1:06:55] somebody is anointing you somebody is
[1:06:57] doing what god said they've got an open
[1:07:00] book
[1:07:01] that we're reading from an open book
[1:07:04] listen the only way we're going to take
[1:07:05] a rapture is by an open book
[1:07:09] we can't take a rapture with a closed
[1:07:10] book
[1:07:13] a closed book
[1:07:15] you can have
[1:07:16] 13 000 different denominations built out
[1:07:18] of it
[1:07:21] but when you have an open book
[1:07:23] you can only have one
[1:07:25] doctrine
[1:07:27] not 20
[1:07:28] not 50.
[1:07:30] i'm talking about message two
[1:07:33] brother joe and i were talking a few
[1:07:34] minutes ago this message people are so
[1:07:36] divided
[1:07:38] we are so divided over this and that and
[1:07:40] the other
[1:07:41] that's why we're still here 60 years
[1:07:44] after the prophets left
[1:07:46] can't get together on anything hardly
[1:07:52] but he and i agreed
[1:07:55] somebody
[1:07:56] is going to produce
[1:07:58] that son of man ministering
[1:08:01] just like jesus produced it and we're
[1:08:03] going to take a resurrection and a
[1:08:05] rapture amen i just believe that
[1:08:08] i just believe that somebody
[1:08:14] and as to be an astronaut on countdown
[1:08:17] is where that quote was about god being
[1:08:19] a man i believe it was
[1:08:21] brother brown said we have to be
[1:08:23] pressurized for the age are we
[1:08:25] pressurized i'm asking you sure we can
[1:08:27] listen we can be pressurized what did i
[1:08:29] read you all the other day about brother
[1:08:30] brown said in the church ages they did
[1:08:33] just enough to get by now that made them
[1:08:35] christians that made them born again
[1:08:36] that made them bride but they got just
[1:08:39] enough
[1:08:41] even your five wives and five foolish
[1:08:44] virgins
[1:08:46] what did the five wives say oh we got
[1:08:48] plenty we got buckets full of it
[1:08:50] no the wives said we've got just enough
[1:08:54] to get through
[1:08:55] we can't spare a dime
[1:08:58] we can't spare an ounce
[1:09:07] that's why we're going to make it but
[1:09:08] we're going to make it by the skin of
[1:09:10] our teeth
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:12] won't be a flower bed to be it'll be a
[1:09:14] battle all the way up to the end
[1:09:16] amen
[1:09:18] listen to this
[1:09:21] john 2 verse 1.
[1:09:23] let's go to that one brothers
[1:09:25] now remember what was the first miracle
[1:09:27] jesus did we're going to have a
[1:09:29] wedding here in just a minute
[1:09:31] the third day there was a marriage in
[1:09:32] canaan of galilee the mother of jesus
[1:09:34] was there and both jesus was called and
[1:09:36] his disciples to the marriage that jesus
[1:09:38] got an invitation
[1:09:39] and when they wanted wine the mother of
[1:09:41] jesus said unto him they have no wine
[1:09:44] jesus said in her woman what have i to
[1:09:45] do with thee my hour has not yet come
[1:09:48] his mother said unto the servants
[1:09:49] whatsoever he said do do it
[1:09:52] now this is the same woman that denied
[1:09:54] the virgin birth okay
[1:09:56] but remember she didn't have the holy
[1:09:58] ghost enter to lead her amen
[1:10:01] and there were set there six water pots
[1:10:03] of stone after the manner of the
[1:10:05] purifying of the jews containing two or
[1:10:07] three perkins apiece
[1:10:08] and jesus said unto them fill the water
[1:10:10] pots with water
[1:10:12] and they filled them
[1:10:13] to the brim and then we know what
[1:10:15] happened but there was six water pots
[1:10:19] i can just picture jesus standing at the
[1:10:21] end of those six water pots
[1:10:24] there'll be one two three four five six
[1:10:28] and there stood the seventh water pot
[1:10:32] he was so full of wine
[1:10:35] until he just turned all them other ones
[1:10:36] into wine all the church ages saw
[1:10:40] and got what's wine
[1:10:42] symbol of the holy ghost right
[1:10:44] wine stimulation of revelation the holy
[1:10:47] ghost six church ages they had the water
[1:10:49] pots
[1:10:50] but in the seventh church age somebody
[1:10:53] somebody showed up
[1:10:55] in flesh
[1:10:57] amen now when it's not william branham
[1:11:00] now he was
[1:11:01] revealing the son of man
[1:11:03] but he wasn't the son of man the son of
[1:11:05] man is me and you collectively as a body
[1:11:08] not one person
[1:11:10] that's what you and i got to see you
[1:11:12] can't say well
[1:11:14] we've had many people preach son of man
[1:11:16] doctrines back back when and
[1:11:19] lord i remember one that they told me
[1:11:20] about that preached on the son of man
[1:11:22] and
[1:11:23] um he believed he was a sort of man i
[1:11:25] guess because he had
[1:11:26] multiple brides
[1:11:29] so but you see it
[1:11:30] always
[1:11:32] if you're not in the word 100
[1:11:36] all right if you're just fooling around
[1:11:38] you can get you can get an anointing of
[1:11:40] god we know that gifts and callings are
[1:11:41] without repentance
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:44] and you can preach because he was
[1:11:45] preaching on the son of man long before
[1:11:47] we heard this is the man way back
[1:11:49] brother claude weissinger was telling me
[1:11:50] back in the eight early 80s
[1:11:52] and said he was preaching it right down
[1:11:53] the line but he had girlfriends
[1:11:56] see somewhere they're going to go off
[1:11:57] but you take somebody that's purely in
[1:11:59] the word of god all of us here purely in
[1:12:02] the word of god we're going to produce
[1:12:04] that's not a man somebody's going to do
[1:12:05] it
[1:12:06] i'll keep saying that until somebody
[1:12:08] says it's me
[1:12:12] be it unto me
[1:12:14] according to thy word
[1:12:17] brother branham that ain't nothing but
[1:12:19] the truth
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:24] let's go to john 3 verse 1 and then
[1:12:26] we'll
[1:12:27] we'll stop right here
[1:12:30] jesus said verily verily i say unto thee
[1:12:32] except the man be born again
[1:12:34] he cannot see
[1:12:36] the kingdom of god
[1:12:38] and we know what he's saying this is the
[1:12:40] nicodemus very very i say unto
[1:12:42] themselves the man be born of water and
[1:12:43] the spirit nicodemus said what
[1:12:45] how can a man be born when he's old can
[1:12:47] he enter the second time in his mother's
[1:12:48] womb and be born he's talking about
[1:12:50] flesh
[1:12:52] verse six that which is born of the
[1:12:53] flesh is flesh
[1:12:54] that which is born of the spirit of
[1:12:56] spirit
[1:12:56] marvel not that i said unto you you must
[1:12:59] be born again
[1:13:00] the wind bloweth where it lifts us and
[1:13:02] thou hears the sound thereof but can't
[1:13:03] not tell whether it come or whether it
[1:13:05] goes so is everyone that is born of the
[1:13:07] spirit
[1:13:08] nicodemus answered said unto him how can
[1:13:10] these things be
[1:13:12] jesus answers in him they're not a
[1:13:14] master of israel
[1:13:16] and know it's not these things very very
[1:13:18] i say unto thee we speak that that we do
[1:13:21] know
[1:13:23] he knew who he was
[1:13:25] and testify that we have seen
[1:13:29] and you receive not our witness
[1:13:31] in other words i'm standing in front of
[1:13:32] you today
[1:13:34] you should be able to at least nicodemus
[1:13:36] feel this anointing that i've got
[1:13:38] you should be able to listen
[1:13:41] because he's continuing if i have told
[1:13:42] you earthly things and you believe not
[1:13:45] how shall you believe if i tell you of
[1:13:47] heavenly things
[1:13:48] and no man has to send it now this
[1:13:49] really probably
[1:13:51] rolled his eyes around because no man
[1:13:53] has ascended up to heaven but he that
[1:13:55] came down from heaven even the son of
[1:13:57] man which is in heaven
[1:14:00] wow
[1:14:02] as moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:14:03] wilderness even so much the son of man
[1:14:05] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[1:14:07] him should not perish but have eternal
[1:14:09] life
[1:14:10] for god so loved the world
[1:14:12] john 3 16
[1:14:14] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:14:16] whosoever believeth in him believeth
[1:14:18] believeth
[1:14:19] in him not believe believeth in him
[1:14:21] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:14:23] life
[1:14:24] for god sent not his son into the world
[1:14:25] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:14:27] might through him through him
[1:14:30] might be saved
[1:14:32] no other salvation outside of the son of
[1:14:34] man
[1:14:35] listen even the son of man died on the
[1:14:37] cross
[1:14:41] and that took those old testament saints
[1:14:43] also
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:46] they resurrected under that
[1:14:48] and he that believeth on him is not
[1:14:49] condemned that he that believeth not is
[1:14:51] condemned already because he hath not
[1:14:53] believed in the name
[1:14:55] of the only begotten son of god what's
[1:14:56] the name of the only begotten son of god
[1:14:58] lord jesus christ
[1:15:00] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:15:02] is coming to the world and men loved
[1:15:04] darkness rather than light
[1:15:06] because their deeds were evil
[1:15:10] listen to this number six meanest man i
[1:15:12] know phoenix arizona brother brown said
[1:15:14] perhaps maybe he'd just go through with
[1:15:15] a sermon of you know jesus first
[1:15:17] doctrine did you ever know what it was
[1:15:19] you must be born again that was his
[1:15:21] first doctrine
[1:15:23] so that should be the first thing that
[1:15:24] we deal with
[1:15:26] instead of do's and don'ts
[1:15:30] brother brown said don't cut your hair
[1:15:32] don't no he didn't say that
[1:15:34] the bible said it
[1:15:35] it's in the bible
[1:15:37] what we were talking about in kentucky
[1:15:38] that's why i was making a point a minute
[1:15:40] ago
[1:15:41] we take this bible and you say well well
[1:15:44] if if you're witnessing to somebody and
[1:15:45] they said well
[1:15:47] and you just asked them a question said
[1:15:48] why do you cut your hair why are you
[1:15:50] able
[1:15:51] to cut your hair if you're saying you
[1:15:52] know the first thing you always ask the
[1:15:54] women is hair and dress
[1:15:56] why don't you wear pants and why don't
[1:15:58] you cut your hair well you know what
[1:16:00] sisters don't say because brother
[1:16:02] branham said
[1:16:04] cause they really don't care what
[1:16:06] brother branham said at that moment
[1:16:10] it's in the bible
[1:16:13] it's in the bible
[1:16:15] let me read it to you
[1:16:17] and then you know what i would say
[1:16:19] like i said before to someone
[1:16:22] i was talking about all these other
[1:16:23] things i said look i'm going to read you
[1:16:26] in the bible with words
[1:16:29] just plain read it right here
[1:16:32] now who told you you could do what
[1:16:33] you're doing
[1:16:37] throw it back at them say look if you
[1:16:38] can cut your hair and wear pants and be
[1:16:40] a christian
[1:16:41] or whatever what we always say hair and
[1:16:43] dress it's everything men cursing all
[1:16:45] the anything you can read in the bible i
[1:16:47] was reading yesterday where the bible
[1:16:49] tells us that this is the temple of the
[1:16:51] holy ghost
[1:16:52] not to defile
[1:16:54] this temple how can you defile this
[1:16:56] temple and god be dwelling inside of you
[1:16:59] how can you do that
[1:17:02] and that's like i told that man that had
[1:17:04] the beer that time and he said well i'm
[1:17:05] glad you got saved you know because he
[1:17:07] said he was saved and i said john what'd
[1:17:09] you get saved from
[1:17:13] and you really never say it like that
[1:17:14] same way with the bible you take the
[1:17:16] bible and you witness to people you take
[1:17:18] the bible and read the bible and then
[1:17:20] they say well that's not what my
[1:17:25] right church
[1:17:27] pastor
[1:17:29] organization
[1:17:30] that's what my denomination
[1:17:33] believes
[1:17:35] well
[1:17:37] why do you make it strange with me
[1:17:41] the way i'm living
[1:17:43] you're saying i'm strange
[1:17:47] and i can read it to you in the bible
[1:17:49] and you're telling me that some man got
[1:17:51] up in the pulpit
[1:17:53] and told you it was all right to do it
[1:17:58] you got that right there's something
[1:17:59] wrong
[1:18:00] if we can read it out of the bible
[1:18:02] that's why i said we have an open book
[1:18:05] we can read it right back to him
[1:18:08] they can't read where they can do these
[1:18:10] things they can't read where they can
[1:18:13] defile their body and still be born
[1:18:14] again they can't do that
[1:18:17] no way
[1:18:20] and that's not
[1:18:21] don't be a hard witness but if somebody
[1:18:23] ever nails you down just say look i can
[1:18:25] read what i'm doing out of here where do
[1:18:27] you read what you can do at
[1:18:29] find me the book
[1:18:32] because this one says holy bible i don't
[1:18:34] know where yours comes from
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:40] all right let's read this and then we're
[1:18:41] done musicians come on
[1:18:44] we're going to skip a little bit forward
[1:18:48] and read this scenario here and then
[1:18:49] we're going to drop back
[1:18:51] give you something to think about
[1:18:52] matthew 17 verse 8
[1:18:54] says when they had lifted up their eyes
[1:18:56] now this is on mount transfiguration
[1:18:57] this is when jesus was coming to the end
[1:18:59] of his of his ministry
[1:19:01] and they saw no man save jesus only and
[1:19:04] as they came down from the mountain
[1:19:07] jesus charged him saying tell the vision
[1:19:09] to no man
[1:19:10] until the son of man be risen again from
[1:19:12] the dead
[1:19:13] he's going to die
[1:19:15] a physical death in just like six months
[1:19:17] from now
[1:19:18] the son of man the person
[1:19:20] but he says risen again from the dead
[1:19:24] now watch and his disciples asked him
[1:19:25] saying why then say the scribes that
[1:19:28] elijah must first come they will quote
[1:19:30] you know what they're quoting
[1:19:32] malachi 4.
[1:19:34] everybody understand that
[1:19:40] why then say the scribes that elijah
[1:19:42] must first come because malachi 4 the
[1:19:45] ending of the old testament
[1:19:47] malachi 4 5 and 6 says that i'll cut
[1:19:50] send you elijah the prophet before the
[1:19:52] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:19:54] the lord
[1:19:56] that's why they know elijah's gotta show
[1:19:58] up the jews do
[1:20:00] so adamant about that because that's
[1:20:01] their last bible that's their last bible
[1:20:04] remember their bible's not matthew
[1:20:06] martin luke and john and all the other
[1:20:07] ones it stops at malachi
[1:20:09] and these people are telling him the
[1:20:11] same thing why they say it describes it
[1:20:12] a loss must first come
[1:20:14] and jesus answered and said unto them
[1:20:16] let's stand to our feet elish truly
[1:20:19] shall first come
[1:20:20] and restore
[1:20:22] all things
[1:20:24] all things
[1:20:26] speaking of the end time
[1:20:30] while the prophet of god had to indict
[1:20:32] this generation for the second
[1:20:33] crucifixion
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:35] you know what it was their traditions
[1:20:37] what crucified him the first time
[1:20:40] the religious people of the world
[1:20:42] what's crucifying him in the end time
[1:20:44] the religious people of the world
[1:20:50] i don't want religion i want salvation
