[0:06] all right
[0:09] God bless you say so it's good to be in
[0:11] the house of the Lord
[0:14] I'm expecting this morning
[0:22] all right I think we got it figured out
[0:24] this time
[0:29] y'all didn't have to applaud that but I
[0:32] appreciate it
[0:34] let's ask the Lord to bless the reading
[0:36] of the word Lord Jesus we're so grateful
[0:38] to be able to gather together this
[0:39] morning around your word and we just
[0:40] come with expectation Lord that whatever
[0:42] happens needs we have Lord that you'll
[0:43] minister to us we ask the Lord It's Your
[0:45] Blessing as we study through your the
[0:47] book of Hebrews this morning and bless
[0:49] brother Wade as he's studying back there
[0:50] Lord granted Lord in the name of the
[0:52] Lord Jesus amen
[0:54] so Hebrews chapter 6 we've been studying
[0:56] through um uh
[0:59] uh well Keepers chapter six which Paul's
[1:02] really getting into the topic of
[1:03] anointed ones so we just kind of
[1:06] finished that up and and dive into that
[1:08] a little bit more this morning and so
[1:10] let's read starting at verse 4 it says
[1:12] for it's impossible for those who were
[1:14] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:16] Heavenly gift so he's talking about
[1:17] people that have to have tasted of the
[1:19] Heavenly gift
[1:21] um that uh you know experienced the
[1:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh on their
[1:25] spirit and their work you know in church
[1:27] and and have have have you know you know
[1:30] recognized things like there's uh
[1:32] there's a message for the age and and uh
[1:35] and we're partakers of the Holy Ghost
[1:37] and have tasted the good word of God and
[1:39] the powers of the world to come if they
[1:40] shall fall away to renew them again
[1:42] under repentance seeing They Crucified
[1:44] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[1:47] him to an open shame and so crucifying
[1:49] crucifying the Son of God is when you
[1:51] your your uh you're you're not just
[1:54] leaving but you're turning around and
[1:55] lashing back at it you reject you're
[1:57] rejecting the word and of course that's
[2:00] what what happened when they crucified
[2:01] Jesus to begin with was they they
[2:03] crucified and they put them on the cross
[2:05] because they rejected what he stood for
[2:06] they rejected his word they didn't
[2:09] believe that he was who said he was and
[2:11] they didn't believe the message that he
[2:13] was bringing for the earth
[2:16] now here's the here's kind of the
[2:18] Clincher and talking about rain for the
[2:21] Earth which drinketh in the rain that
[2:23] cometh off on it that the rain comes and
[2:25] and falls on the Earth and the Earth
[2:27] just soaks it up and in the earth you've
[2:30] got a lot of different a lot of
[2:31] different seeds coming up you got good
[2:32] and bad and thorns and Briars and and
[2:35] wheat and everything coming up and
[2:37] they're all drinking of that rain for
[2:39] the Earth was drinking in the rain that
[2:40] cometh off on it and bringeth forth
[2:42] herbs meat for them by whom it is
[2:43] dressed receiveth blessing from God
[2:47] but so you'd see what brother Brown will
[2:48] get to as uh as as we started this out
[2:50] and what Paul's trying to trying to
[2:52] point out is just because you come to
[2:53] church and you get a blessing doesn't
[2:55] mean it doesn't necessarily mean that
[2:57] that down on the inside that Soul has
[2:59] received the word
[3:00] but that which Barrett thorns and Briars
[3:02] is rejected so you can you can you can
[3:05] see the evidence of what uh an
[3:07] individual is or what a plan is by the
[3:08] fruit that is bearing
[3:10] because you know brother Randall in one
[3:13] place he said your fruit is your
[3:14] Doctrine your fruit it grows up and it
[3:16] manifests itself it comes out and it
[3:18] manifests the doctrine is actually alive
[3:20] now and so you can see you can taste the
[3:22] fruit of another person's believer's
[3:24] life
[3:25] so when that when you're when you're
[3:27] bearing thorns and Briars instead of
[3:29] love and joy and peace and long
[3:30] suffering and all those kind of things
[3:31] and then thorns and Briars is what's
[3:34] rejected
[3:35] and is nine to cursing who's in this to
[3:37] be burned
[3:39] so
[3:41] you know last time we talked about to
[3:43] you you've got to
[3:46] um Paul talking about it's impossible
[3:48] for those who are once enlightened and
[3:51] and one way of looking at that isn't as
[3:53] the light is going to go the light
[3:55] travels from age to age and you've got
[3:58] to keep Pace with it and so the Martin
[4:01] the the people that follow Martin Luther
[4:03] they they eventually uh along along they
[4:07] denominated and they cabbage down and
[4:09] they said well now we've got it and they
[4:11] failed to move along with the light as
[4:13] it progressed
[4:14] that's that's really what a denomination
[4:16] is is when you're cabbage down you say
[4:18] oh we got it we we we we got the
[4:21] understanding and and failed to see that
[4:23] that God is continuing to move on and
[4:25] like Paul's talking as he as he just
[4:27] starts talking in the beginning of
[4:29] Hebrews chapter six he's trying to God
[4:31] is trying to move us to Perfection he's
[4:33] trying to move the whole church to
[4:34] Perfection all down through the seven
[4:36] Church ages and some the light is moving
[4:38] on to bring us to a place where we can
[4:41] we we're one with Christ to perfection
[4:44] so you got to keep Pace with it and and
[4:46] you know if you don't keep Pace with it
[4:48] then uh that you the all those types of
[4:52] you you can't you can't live by a Mana
[4:55] that's been stored up and you you've
[4:56] gotta you gotta stay with a present
[4:58] tense reality a present tense message
[5:01] John Wesley come along and he preached
[5:03] uh corresponding to first Thessalonians
[5:06] 5 23 the very God of Peace sanctify you
[5:08] holy
[5:09] that God was able to take a Believer and
[5:11] sanctify him and make them live a holy
[5:13] life and make them get rid of all the
[5:15] things in the world and start start uh
[5:17] like where Martin Luther would be
[5:19] smoking a pipe and and so forth and
[5:21] sitting in the pub talking about the
[5:23] gospel but yet John Wesley come along
[5:24] and he began to believe in a in a
[5:26] Sanctified holy life
[5:29] I see it's building up we don't we don't
[5:31] get away from those things those
[5:33] foundational precepts that we're living
[5:35] God wants us to live a holy life a set
[5:38] apart life and then Azusa Street moving
[5:40] on up to the restoration of the gifts so
[5:43] the gospel is like it's it's like the
[5:45] the spirit is like a light that
[5:47] illuminates the word and makes it live
[5:48] and so brother Adam said for it is
[5:50] impossible when he when he was
[5:52] explaining this scripture for it is
[5:53] impossible for those who were once
[5:55] enlightened and didn't move on with the
[5:57] word as it come to pass they are dead
[6:00] gone
[6:01] and the thorns and thistles
[6:03] which is nigh unto rejection whose end
[6:06] is to be burned so you see what happens
[6:08] when you don't keep Pace with the word
[6:10] what happens is they cabbage down and
[6:12] they they said well this is it and they
[6:14] and they failed and they came to up
[6:15] there came to a place where where God
[6:18] said I I'm I'm going on I'm I'm leaving
[6:21] you're not keeping Pace with me so
[6:23] that whole question that keeps coming up
[6:25] or can you be born again in a
[6:28] denomination and things you know you
[6:30] know let me maybe just kind of think
[6:31] about there was a time where FF Bosworth
[6:34] if it I don't know if he ever came to
[6:36] the realization that brother Brown was a
[6:38] was a Believer but I believe he was born
[6:39] again and brother Brown would sit under
[6:41] him and and or or listen to listen to
[6:43] the things he said he was a great
[6:44] influence to him but yet I believe he
[6:47] was a a overlap times you got the
[6:49] overlaps where somebody like like Billy
[6:51] Graham or Roberts really could that that
[6:54] God would be moving in their life and
[6:55] they had a part to play and there's
[6:57] times of overlap but you keep you've got
[6:59] to keep moving on because sooner or
[7:01] later the God is going to leave you
[7:04] behind and uh so you you got to keep
[7:08] moving on that's the that's the main
[7:10] thing
[7:11] and this morning in church age brother
[7:12] round and said now we have been
[7:14] constantly saying that the true evidence
[7:16] of being baptized with the Holy Ghost is
[7:18] for the believer to receive the word for
[7:20] the age in which he lives to receive the
[7:23] word for the age so now now if you
[7:25] really want to get get down like when
[7:27] John Wesley began to priest they
[7:29] couldn't they couldn't in that age say
[7:31] well we're just going to stay with
[7:32] Martin Luther's understanding
[7:35] or when the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:37] was restored on on Azusa Street it would
[7:40] be it would be dangerous to to try to
[7:43] stay uh back to keep keep back with the
[7:45] Methodist understanding
[7:47] so like in brother in Revelation chapter
[7:49] 3 22 it says he that hath an ear let him
[7:52] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[7:53] churches and last time we were talking
[7:54] about if you want to know what God's
[7:56] saying you've got to get under the
[7:58] message of your day of your age that's
[8:00] you that's the only way that you're
[8:02] going to hear what the spirit wants to
[8:03] wants for you to understand
[8:05] so again what you get back what what's
[8:07] what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[8:08] and in each age there was a group of
[8:10] people that were called out that
[8:11] listened to the word of their Porter
[8:13] that open up the door a way of escape
[8:15] and they heard that message and they
[8:17] said under that message and were subject
[8:19] to it as the word went out and you
[8:22] receive it and you bear fruit for that
[8:24] age
[8:25] so that's really that's really the
[8:26] evidence
[8:28] so so if you
[8:30] if you taste of the of the good things
[8:33] and you and you fall away and you don't
[8:35] keep going on with the word and you or
[8:37] you know
[8:39] that the exactly so that Paul's saying
[8:43] have tasted the good word of God and the
[8:44] powers of the world to come if they
[8:46] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[8:48] repentance seeing they crucify to
[8:50] themselves the God Son of God afresh and
[8:53] put him to an open shame so we've got
[8:55] all these examples in the Old Testament
[8:56] and the New Testament of those that
[8:58] didn't keep Pace with the word that
[9:00] didn't go on like like Cain Cain did not
[9:03] get under subjection to the word of his
[9:05] day which was Abel's message that we
[9:07] need to we need a lamb we it's blood it
[9:09] was there's a the problem was life the
[9:11] problem from the beginning was life and
[9:13] there's got to be something to pay to
[9:15] pay the the price for us and and so he
[9:18] failed to get under subjection to the
[9:20] word and Nathan and coral following
[9:22] Moses they failed to realize that God
[9:24] wanted them to go into the promised land
[9:26] and that Moses was the one to take them
[9:28] so they they failed to get into
[9:30] subjection to the word of the day and
[9:32] Balaam going around acting like a uh he
[9:35] he was acting like a Believer a
[9:37] religious hypocrite and and trying to
[9:39] get everybody together and say we're all
[9:41] one that was his message
[9:42] went out that the 10 line spies that
[9:44] hung around and failed to go into the
[9:47] promised land you see the example of all
[9:48] these they they they were they were in
[9:51] church will say that they were going
[9:52] along with the other believers but yet
[9:54] they rejected the word
[9:56] so what's it come down to word rejecters
[10:00] and in the New Testament we've got
[10:01] Caiaphas prophesying prophesying while
[10:04] they were on the hanging Jesus on the
[10:06] cross but yet he they he was over them
[10:09] that crucified Jesus and Judas that hung
[10:11] around until the very last
[10:14] hung around with Jesus
[10:17] going along carrying the money the money
[10:20] with for all the disciples and casting
[10:22] out devils and and uh and preaching the
[10:25] gospel and and doing all those kind of
[10:26] things you know that's kind of a it's a
[10:28] scary topic it should it should be
[10:30] something to you know make us examine
[10:32] ourselves and make us make us uh uh
[10:35] examine Our Lives
[10:37] so look at what brother Brown said and I
[10:39] think this was the church age book he
[10:41] said no one denies that the spirit of
[10:42] God manifesting and Gifts is upon them
[10:45] but like Balaam they have all have their
[10:47] programs make their appeal for money
[10:50] exercise gifts but deny the word or
[10:55] bypass it for fear that a controversy
[10:57] might diminish their chances
[11:00] for greater gain so instead of interest
[11:02] and interest in the word
[11:04] and the only one's going to be
[11:05] interested more in money
[11:07] and and and and gifts and programs
[11:11] and things like that again see that the
[11:14] word is a central thing the word is what
[11:17] makes the difference
[11:18] yet they preached salvation and
[11:20] deliverance through the power of God
[11:21] just like Judas with a Ministry imparted
[11:23] by Christ
[11:24] but because they are wrong seed
[11:27] consequently they have a wrong Spirit
[11:29] motivating them
[11:31] you see how the seed the the word that's
[11:34] planted actually is what will it allow
[11:38] it it uh
[11:40] makes a way for the spirit to become
[11:42] active in your life
[11:43] so if the wrong seed is planted then the
[11:46] wrong spirit will be motivating you but
[11:48] if the rice seed is planted then the
[11:50] rice spirit will be motivating you
[11:52] that's that's actually you know
[11:54] sometimes you'll think well I wonder I
[11:56] wonder if their spirit is with us well
[11:58] if the word is with us if you've got the
[12:01] right understanding the right attitude
[12:04] toward the word then the spirit will be
[12:06] with you
[12:07] see if you ever wanted you feeling like
[12:08] maybe you feel get to feeling down or
[12:10] something well do like David did when
[12:13] they they ran and kidnapped his wives
[12:15] and kidnapped everything and he's he
[12:16] said bring me the ephot he turned back
[12:19] to the to the word for that day the word
[12:22] is the main thing
[12:25] religious oh my they outshined the elect
[12:28] and effort and Zeal but it is a layout
[12:31] of sea and not of Christ for it looks
[12:33] for big crowds big programs and
[12:35] startling signs amongst them you see how
[12:37] the evidence of success in the gospel is
[12:41] not a lot of people or a lot of big
[12:43] programs or a lot of money success in
[12:46] the gospel is are you overcoming it
[12:49] doesn't matter if you have a lot of
[12:51] people around you or a lot of money or
[12:53] or you're a big successful preacher
[12:55] success in the gospel is is the gospel
[12:58] having an effect in your life are you
[12:59] overcoming because if you're overcoming
[13:02] and you're preaching to a a a a a stream
[13:07] and eating soda crackers or whatever
[13:08] that's that's all that matters all that
[13:11] matters is that you have given yourself
[13:13] to God and he's using you it doesn't
[13:15] matter there's a lot of impersonations
[13:17] but we want the genuine he said they
[13:20] preached the second coming of Christ but
[13:22] deny the Advent of the Prophet messenger
[13:24] though in power and signs and true
[13:26] Revelation he eclipses them all
[13:29] this false spirit that in the last day
[13:31] is so close to the real can be
[13:33] distinguished only by its deviation from
[13:35] the word and whenever it is caught and
[13:38] being anti-word it falls back on the one
[13:40] argument we have already shown to be
[13:42] false we get results don't we we have to
[13:45] be of God now now that doesn't mean so
[13:48] you read this something maybe maybe a
[13:50] trap we fall into sometimes is you know
[13:52] Jesus said don't uproot don't uproot
[13:55] people wait till they grow up and
[13:57] harvest and then God will take care of
[13:59] it but we have a tendency sometimes to
[14:01] go grabbing people and just pulling them
[14:02] pluck them out of the earth and tossing
[14:04] them over but you just wait and things
[14:06] will things will things will manifest in
[14:08] time
[14:09] and uh you know he said they'll say we
[14:12] get results don't we well that don't
[14:14] mean results is bad I want to see
[14:17] results in my life but again it comes
[14:19] down to the differentiator is the word
[14:21] look at the word just because somebody's
[14:23] saying that we get results and preaching
[14:25] some false Doctrine now that's that's
[14:27] where you you gotta you raise your
[14:29] eyebrows and and and and uh maybe take a
[14:33] step back
[14:34] but the word will bring results and the
[14:38] main thing is the word
[14:40] the word is the seed and the seed will
[14:43] bring the right Spirit the rice seed
[14:44] will bring the right Spirit and the rice
[14:46] seed will bring the right kind of
[14:47] results
[14:49] so brother Ram said now this is the
[14:51] quote so many people have stumbled over
[14:52] the years and this is what Paul's
[14:54] getting at now we're not getting away
[14:55] from what Paul's talking about it is
[14:58] impossible for those who are once
[14:59] enlightened and have tasted of the
[15:01] Heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[15:04] the Holy Ghost so brother Adam said in
[15:06] the message leadership he said many of
[15:08] you think I got the baptism of the Holy
[15:10] Ghost I'm going to heaven
[15:14] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[15:16] Ghost every hour in your life and still
[15:19] be lost and go to hell the Bible says so
[15:22] I hope that doesn't choke anybody this
[15:24] morning but that's a that's a big that's
[15:26] a big statement and you can have the
[15:28] baptism only ghost every hour in your
[15:30] life
[15:31] so so there we can see there's a
[15:33] difference between the baptism of the
[15:35] Holy Ghost and the new birth right the
[15:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost has got to
[15:39] have something to Quicken but you've got
[15:41] the seed planted then the baptism of the
[15:43] Holy Ghost will give you a birth
[15:45] when the rain falls it's got to have
[15:47] some seed and if there's wrong seed
[15:49] planting then it's not going to be able
[15:51] to Quicken the way that God wants it to
[15:53] but if you've got the right seed plant
[15:55] if you've got a wheat seed planted when
[15:57] the rain falls the batch is the Holy
[15:59] Ghost it's going to bring up that rice
[16:01] seed and it's going to manifest it's
[16:03] going to Quicken a real genuine life
[16:06] so what's the most important thing the
[16:09] most important thing is the word if you
[16:11] get the word sewn down and you hold on
[16:13] to that word and maybe there's questions
[16:15] and things but you hang on to that word
[16:17] at the baptism Holy Ghost we'll Quicken
[16:19] it
[16:20] amen amen
[16:22] absolutely it'll make it real I mean
[16:28] now see there's so many there's so many
[16:30] uh examples in scripture of false
[16:34] now brother around or the Bible says in
[16:35] chapter Mark chapter 3 that he ordained
[16:38] 12 that they should be with him and that
[16:39] he might send them forth to preach and
[16:42] they have power to heal sicknesses and
[16:45] to cast out Devils now there you got
[16:47] Jesus moving around with our Judas with
[16:49] the with the 12 and and he's a devil to
[16:52] begin with and yet he's going around
[16:55] with a baptism of holy ghost or the the
[16:58] spirit moving in his life the spirit on
[17:01] us on giving that has given him power to
[17:04] heal sicknesses and to cast out devils
[17:07] and he's going around preaching the
[17:08] gospel but yet false down on the inside
[17:12] and the Bible says in Matthew 24 for
[17:14] there shall arise false Christ and false
[17:17] prophets and shall show great signs and
[17:20] wonders and so much that effort were
[17:22] possible they shall deceive the very
[17:23] elect but brother Branham in the message
[17:25] and only one said that the very elect
[17:27] won't be deceived because they will be
[17:30] the word and if you are the word how can
[17:32] you be deceived because you know what
[17:35] you're looking for you know the the
[17:37] differentiator the thing that makes the
[17:40] difference is the word
[17:42] foreign
[17:44] in Matthew Chapter 5 he said you have
[17:46] heard that it has been said Thou shalt
[17:47] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[17:49] but I say unto you love your enemies
[17:52] bless them that curse you now now look
[17:55] what Jesus is getting to the rain falls
[17:57] on the just unjust but before he gets to
[18:00] that he lays out this pattern I know
[18:02] there's going to be he's saying I know
[18:04] there's going to be fakers I know
[18:06] there's going to be uh wolves and
[18:08] sheep's clothing but listen you got to
[18:10] love everybody you can't just go around
[18:12] yanking people up and toss them into
[18:14] fire and say well you know throwing
[18:17] people out be careful with throwing
[18:19] people out
[18:21] but he said boss I love your enemies
[18:23] bless them that curse you do good to
[18:26] them that hate you and pray for them
[18:27] which despitefully use you and persecute
[18:30] you there's an example of a real
[18:32] believer when you can when you can show
[18:35] love to somebody that disagrees with
[18:37] your doctrine that don't that don't like
[18:39] you very much and that that that shuns
[18:42] the way that you believe or the way that
[18:43] you think
[18:44] he said that you may be the children of
[18:46] your father which is in heaven for he
[18:49] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[18:51] the good and sendeth the rain on the
[18:53] just and on the unjust
[18:55] so there you've got another example of
[18:57] rain falling on all different kinds of
[18:59] seeds falling on the earth the baptism
[19:02] of the Holy ghosts fallen on people they
[19:04] have all have no seed planted fall seed
[19:07] planted the genuine seed planted and
[19:09] it's going to bring up
[19:11] what's been planted
[19:13] the rain falls on the just and the
[19:16] unjust now brother Brown we we talked
[19:18] about this story maybe I'll maybe I'll
[19:19] go through this fast quickly but I think
[19:22] I think we're all familiar with the
[19:23] story of that he talked about in
[19:25] anointing ones of the of the two
[19:27] Believers in that in that Pentecostal
[19:28] meeting that and one was not living
[19:31] right and one was genuine and he said
[19:33] here were two men one of which was a
[19:35] real believer and the other was a sinful
[19:36] impersonator yet both were manifesting
[19:38] gifts
[19:39] and brother and God showed him in
[19:42] Hebrews chapter 6 the chapter that we're
[19:44] studying he gave him the example of that
[19:46] situation where he was real perplexed
[19:48] how can how can this one be speaking in
[19:50] tongues in this genuine Holy Ghost be
[19:52] moving in his life but yet he's he's I
[19:55] know by desarma that he's not living
[19:57] he's living with a a woman that's not
[19:59] his wife or uh I forget the specifics of
[20:02] the situation but she he was not living
[20:04] right so he looked to Hebrews 6 and he
[20:06] saw that the sower went forth to sow and
[20:09] he sowed the genuine seed and then
[20:10] another sower went behind him and sowed
[20:12] another the fake the the the the tares
[20:15] and the after a while the tares came up
[20:17] and the wheat and tears grew together
[20:18] and they partooked the same nourishment
[20:20] out of the same soil and they drank in
[20:23] the same sun and rain
[20:25] isn't that interesting that both kind of
[20:27] seeds can partake can get a benefit out
[20:29] of the baptism the Holy Ghost but one
[20:31] can be genuine and one can be false
[20:35] and in the Bible we've got The Parables
[20:37] that uh that that Jesus told of a
[20:40] different kind of
[20:44] something's moving in my backyard I keep
[20:46] getting notifications I keep getting uh
[20:51] you know excuse me
[20:52] Jesus told that that Parable in Matthew
[20:55] Chapter 13 of the of the of the of the
[20:57] of the sower that so different kinds of
[20:59] sow the seed and the seed uh now the way
[21:03] brother Brown explained it he'd say some
[21:06] some of it fell by the wayside
[21:08] and he said like water on a duck's back
[21:10] it just run right off a bird will
[21:12] carried away and it's just like water on
[21:13] a duck's back but some felt some of the
[21:15] seed fell on Rocky ground
[21:17] Stony ground it just had a little dust
[21:19] that blowed up there and sprung up but
[21:20] it didn't have no roots no place to put
[21:22] his roots
[21:23] and he said now I'm going to make
[21:24] illustrations here and I hope I don't
[21:26] hurt no feelings see that was the
[21:28] Catholic Church who thought they were a
[21:30] rock he said they thought they were they
[21:32] was built on a rock that's what they
[21:34] said he said I'll agree with them I'm
[21:36] not sure we'll agree with them no Earth
[21:38] under it at all no Earth on it to grow
[21:40] from
[21:41] why I couldn't produce it and then some
[21:44] fell on the protestant's ground but
[21:45] after a while the great wisdom of the
[21:47] big denomination choked it out you see
[21:49] how you got to be careful with with
[21:51] cabbaging down on a little bit of
[21:52] understanding that we got when you say
[21:54] well I got it and put a period behind it
[21:56] and won't move on then how's the seed
[21:59] going to come up it just gets choked out
[22:02] but if we'll have a real now see the
[22:05] real good ground let's look at listen
[22:07] and see what brought around how he
[22:08] explained this he said some fail
[22:11] and the valley of persecution
[22:14] oh man when the ground is all tilled up
[22:17] when people people are treating you
[22:19] wrong and you just get all broken down
[22:20] and you got to get along with God and
[22:22] the ground's all tilled up and you get
[22:24] to you've got a broken and a contrite
[22:26] heart and you're ready for to receive
[22:28] that word you get to a place of
[22:29] desperation and you're like God I I've
[22:32] been sitting around maybe in the church
[22:33] for a long time but something's got to
[22:35] give I need something that's real
[22:37] something that's genuine
[22:39] and he said now in the valley is where
[22:41] you find the water the best soil when
[22:44] you take somebody has been beat down
[22:46] till he's got all the theology beat out
[22:49] of him laughed out of him made fun of
[22:51] him where he's been through the Mills
[22:53] and grounded all out of him until the
[22:55] metal has been ready to work you'll find
[22:57] out there is some moisture around there
[23:00] that's right into the valley that fella
[23:02] has been pitched over into the valley
[23:04] kicked out of his organization he's down
[23:07] in the dumps they call it not the dumps
[23:09] but the valley we're taught down in the
[23:11] valley you know that's where the Lily
[23:13] grows you know
[23:14] that's right in the valley
[23:17] some fell in the valley
[23:20] of persecutions hard trial
[23:23] some of them seed fell in their Valley
[23:25] of persecutions hard trials he called
[23:28] everything like the Lily was called
[23:30] bl's above made fun of
[23:32] and that in that good ground that good
[23:35] ground of seed being sown and a and a
[23:37] receptive heart is where it'll come up
[23:40] where Jesus said he that received good
[23:42] received into the good ground is he that
[23:45] heareth the word somebody that's ready
[23:47] to receive it and understandeth it
[23:51] so you see what what really gives you
[23:54] rest is when you understand the word
[23:56] what really gives you confidence is when
[23:59] you understand it you can go along and
[24:02] you don't you maybe you come to church
[24:03] and you don't understand what's being
[24:04] preached but then one day it the spirit
[24:07] just comes and just quickens it because
[24:09] you've been hanging on to it and you've
[24:11] held it and you understand so there's
[24:14] your evidence he that heareth the word
[24:17] and understandeth it which also beareth
[24:20] fruit and bringeth forth some 100 fold
[24:23] some 60 some 30. all down through the
[24:27] church ages different groups of
[24:29] Believers have brought forth different
[24:30] different amounts but I believe in this
[24:33] church age you're going to bring you're
[24:35] going to bring forth a Bountiful Harvest
[24:37] you're going to bring forth an
[24:39] understanding of the son of man you're
[24:41] going to bring forth he that he Hearth
[24:43] the word and understand if this
[24:44] Revelation you're gonna it's time to
[24:46] bring forth a a great harvest that can
[24:49] be harvested in a rapture
[24:51] so Paul's saying in Hebrews chapter 6
[24:54] and I've tasted the good word of God and
[24:56] the powers of the world to come if they
[24:58] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[25:00] repentance and the musicians can go
[25:01] ahead and come forward
[25:03] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[25:05] Son of God afresh and Jesus said in
[25:07] Matthew chapter 7 not everyone that
[25:09] saith unto me Lord Lord so enter into
[25:11] the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth
[25:13] the will of My Father which is in heaven
[25:16] and what's his will his will is his word
[25:19] I my wife and I were talking about
[25:21] somebody we know that had been praying
[25:23] that they got in a real bad spot and
[25:25] they were saying don't pray don't pray
[25:27] that I be healed but pray for the will
[25:29] of God but what is the will of God God
[25:33] wants you to be healed see that's
[25:35] something that you can rest in when when
[25:37] you have understanding that God wants
[25:39] you to be healed then it banishes all
[25:41] the questions and you're wondering does
[25:43] God what does God want me to be happy
[25:45] yes God wants you to be happy he wants
[25:48] you to have peace he wants you to be
[25:50] healed he wants you to be well so we'll
[25:53] leave you on that that's all God bless
[25:55] you
[25:57] foreign
