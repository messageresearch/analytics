[0:00] their mamas
[0:05] all right we're talking about uh the
[0:07] high priest
[0:09] in uh hebrews chapter five and just kind
[0:11] of wanted to start on this slide it just
[0:13] kind of said in your mind um that christ
[0:15] is our high priest
[0:17] and he's
[0:18] the high priest of our confession and
[0:20] he's seated on the throne of our heart
[0:22] and
[0:23] you know you in the old testament the
[0:25] high priest would go into the
[0:27] um the holy of holies and on the day of
[0:29] atonement once a year and and do his
[0:31] work and you know but but now christ is
[0:34] fulfilling that role
[0:36] so let's just go to the lord in prayer
[0:37] before we get into this scripture and
[0:39] begin our little study lord we asked
[0:41] lord that you'll just bless our study
[0:42] this morning and bless all the ones that
[0:44] are uh like brother terence said that
[0:46] are traveling brother wade and brother
[0:47] louise lord as their minister in this
[0:49] this uh this morning
[0:51] we ask that you'll just be with us today
[0:52] lord god and help us lord as we come
[0:54] expecting to receive from you in the
[0:56] name of the lord jesus
[0:59] so hebrews chapter 5 verse 1 says for
[1:02] every high priest taken from among men
[1:05] is ordained for men
[1:08] so paul is sitting in our mind he begins
[1:10] to set what what a high priest is and
[1:13] and how a high priest is called is
[1:15] called of god it's not somebody that
[1:17] that says well i i think that i would i
[1:19] would like to do this job it's somebody
[1:21] that god has ordained for that purpose
[1:23] and the high priest his job is to ordain
[1:26] for men
[1:28] and things pertaining to god that he may
[1:30] offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
[1:34] and sometimes it's a little bit easier
[1:35] to read another translation so i've got
[1:37] another translate the berean study bible
[1:39] um some
[1:41] somebody was asking me recently is it
[1:42] okay to read other translations and i i
[1:44] say if if it'll help you
[1:48] you sometimes the king james version has
[1:50] um you know we don't we don't really
[1:52] think in the way that they that it's
[1:53] it's written sometimes so it helps to
[1:55] kind of pull up another another version
[1:57] a little bit and
[1:58] and compare them course you know you got
[1:59] to be careful but
[2:01] um anything that'll help i'm in favor of
[2:04] um so the berean study bible says every
[2:06] high priest is appointed from among men
[2:08] to represent them in matters relating to
[2:10] god to offer gifts and sacrifices for
[2:12] sins
[2:13] and the king james version goes on and
[2:15] says who can have compassion on the
[2:17] ignorant and on them that are out of the
[2:18] way for that he himself also is
[2:20] compassed with infirmity so in other
[2:22] words uh we've got a high priest that
[2:25] look so in the old testament the high
[2:27] priest was was somebody like them that
[2:29] that had his own weaknesses and had his
[2:32] own struggles and things but now
[2:34] jesus is a high priest that has no sin
[2:37] but yet he went through he was tempted
[2:38] like we are and he he uh you know uh
[2:42] like in the prince of the house of david
[2:44] the author there said that he had a
[2:45] headache there at the tomb of lazarus
[2:47] and
[2:47] and
[2:48] uh and and so he he know he understands
[2:52] what we're going through
[2:53] whether you're no matter where you are
[2:55] in life if you're a young child he was a
[2:57] child so he knows the struggles of a
[2:59] child if you're a teenager he
[3:01] understands the struggles of a teenager
[3:03] and knows the the you know uh
[3:06] how how maybe adults uh seem to
[3:08] misunderstand you sometimes and all of
[3:10] those kind of things
[3:11] and
[3:12] what a blessing it is to when when we go
[3:14] to prayer we have somebody that we can
[3:16] reach out to that knows what what's
[3:19] what's happening what we're dealing with
[3:21] and so it says by reason hereof he all
[3:23] does for the people so also for himself
[3:26] to offer sins
[3:28] and and paul goes on to say and no man
[3:30] taketh this honor unto himself
[3:33] but he that is called of god
[3:35] as was aaron
[3:37] so now jesus of course you know uh he he
[3:40] all through his ministry he would he
[3:42] would uh he would kind of go back to you
[3:44] know i didn't i'm not i'm not putting
[3:46] myself into this situation i'm not i'm
[3:47] not saying these things of myself but
[3:50] actually actually god the bearing
[3:51] witness of me
[3:53] and anybody that's called of god they
[3:54] don't they don't put themselves into
[3:56] that role
[3:57] you go back to exodus 28 it says when
[4:00] when god actually called heir into the
[4:02] role of the high priest and he said take
[4:03] thou unto the air and thy brother now
[4:05] look aaron aaron it wasn't because aaron
[4:07] uh was a particularly great person or
[4:10] anything like that or
[4:13] but god god chose him to to fulfill the
[4:16] role of the high priest and all of his
[4:17] sons so he called them and so we just
[4:20] want to dwell on what a calling is for a
[4:22] few minutes
[4:23] that he may minister unto me and the
[4:25] priest's office even arab nadav and
[4:27] abihu eleazar and ithamar air and sons
[4:30] and thou shall make holy garments for
[4:31] her and thy brother
[4:33] for glory and for beauty and thou shalt
[4:35] speak unto all that are wise hearted
[4:37] whom i have filled with the spirit of
[4:38] wisdom that they may make aaron's
[4:40] garments to consecrate him that he may
[4:42] minister unto me in the priest's office
[4:44] so aaron was set aside to fulfill that
[4:46] role that god a calling of god is
[4:49] something where god is god is god it's a
[4:51] supernatural thing where god is moving
[4:53] on the scene to draw somebody into a
[4:55] place that he wants them to be in
[4:58] now you say oh well
[4:59] it's a minister you're talking about i'm
[5:01] talking about i'm talking about anybody
[5:03] if he's drawing you maybe this born and
[5:05] speaking to your heart is god calling
[5:07] you to be a christian god drawing you
[5:09] into the spot that he wants you to be in
[5:11] and so he we're we're hewn like at like
[5:14] those um
[5:15] those blocks that went into the the
[5:17] temple that that solomon built god draws
[5:20] us and then he hews us out and puts us
[5:22] right where he wants us to go so you
[5:25] know
[5:26] when you're when you're born again maybe
[5:27] he'll begin to speak to your heart and
[5:29] say well i i want you to preach the
[5:30] gospel and you begin to feel like maybe
[5:32] there's maybe there's something a call
[5:34] in my life and he's drawing you it's god
[5:36] drawing you and pulling you
[5:38] not yourself
[5:39] drawing you to put you into a place
[5:42] so and the maybe maybe the one the
[5:45] greatest example of a call of god is in
[5:46] isaiah where isaiah you know he'd been
[5:48] looking at uriah and looking at men and
[5:50] then
[5:52] what other people are doing and finally
[5:53] god got him to a place where he pulled
[5:55] him off to the side and and showed him
[5:57] that showed him what his real influence
[5:59] should be his brother brown priest in
[6:01] that sermon influence
[6:02] and the seraphim took a coal of fire off
[6:05] of the altar and he laid upon his mouth
[6:07] and said lo this had touched thy lips
[6:09] and that iniquity is taken away and that
[6:11] sin purged
[6:12] also i heard the voice of the lord
[6:14] saying whom shall i see and who will go
[6:15] for us so so god's wanting somebody that
[6:19] there's when god calls you there's got
[6:21] to be you got to respond and when he
[6:23] calls you it's not he's not forcing you
[6:24] he's not going to force you to be a
[6:26] christian he's not going to force you to
[6:28] be a preacher he's not going to force
[6:29] you to be a deacon whatever that is but
[6:32] he he wanted isaiah to say i'll go i'll
[6:34] do it
[6:36] whom shall i sin and who will go for us
[6:38] then said i hear am i send me
[6:42] so
[6:44] jesus was called he was he was called
[6:46] because it was god moving in him to be
[6:48] our high priest and to fulfill
[6:51] you know how could how could anybody of
[6:52] themselves go up on the cross and die
[6:54] and do all of those things but yet god
[6:56] it was got the life of god in him down
[6:59] veiled within that flesh to go to go
[7:02] minister for us and to perform the the
[7:05] the deeds of a high priest and to be to
[7:07] be our high priest to to live the life
[7:10] and to preach the gospel and all those
[7:11] all those things but let's just meditate
[7:13] for a few moments on on what some other
[7:16] great preachers have said about being
[7:18] called
[7:20] now i i i love some of these quotes that
[7:23] as i was kind of doing some research
[7:26] david livingston said
[7:28] if a commissioned by an earthly king is
[7:29] considered an honor
[7:31] how can a commission
[7:32] by heavenly king be considered a
[7:34] sacrifice
[7:38] and robert dabney said the true doctrine
[7:40] of calling
[7:42] is that the man whom god has designed
[7:44] and qualified to preach
[7:47] learns his call through the word
[7:50] now
[7:51] that's a powerful quote right there
[7:53] let's let's sit on that for a second
[7:55] now because you know that goes for a
[7:57] christian too
[7:58] now you know you you when you're called
[8:00] of god and you you
[8:02] you start coming to church and along and
[8:04] along you you begin to maybe wonder if
[8:05] you're born again and what's going on
[8:07] and
[8:08] but
[8:09] you you begin to get surety
[8:12] from the word the word is where actually
[8:15] you you began over time it as it begins
[8:18] to open up to you you begin to identify
[8:20] yourself and your life and what god has
[8:22] done with you
[8:23] by the word
[8:24] so maybe somebody would say well how do
[8:26] how do i know if i'm called to preach
[8:28] how do i know if i'm called that you you
[8:31] look into the word and the word is what
[8:33] identifies your calling the true
[8:36] doctrine of calling is that the man whom
[8:38] god has designed and qualified to preach
[8:40] learns his call through the word
[8:42] the word is the instrument by which the
[8:44] spirit teaches him
[8:46] with prayer that he is to preach
[8:48] the word is the thing that that
[8:50] identifies your calling maybe that's
[8:52] kind of a it's a really profound thing
[8:55] but i've found that to be true when you
[8:58] when you get into a rough spot and
[8:59] you're wondering what what's what's
[9:00] happening in your life you go back to
[9:02] the word and the word is what proves
[9:04] things out right when you can begin to
[9:06] look in your life and see that your life
[9:08] lines up with
[9:09] with with uh
[9:11] your life parallels the stories that
[9:13] you're reading in the bible of david and
[9:14] all these all these great men and you
[9:16] can see your life played out in the
[9:17] story of rahab then you begin to get
[9:20] confidence that your life is going in
[9:21] the right path that you're walking in
[9:23] the light of god's word
[9:26] martin lord jane said jones martin lloyd
[9:29] jones said it was mr spurgeon i believe
[9:31] who used to say to young men
[9:33] if you can do anything else do it
[9:37] if you can do anything else
[9:39] do it
[9:40] because if you're doing it of your own
[9:42] self to be popular or for fame or for
[9:44] money or to to to be a great person
[9:47] you're doing it for the wrong thing
[9:49] if you can stay out of the ministry stay
[9:51] out of the ministry
[9:52] i would certainly say that without any
[9:54] hesitation whatsoever
[9:56] i would say that the only man who is
[9:57] called to preach is the man who cannot
[9:59] do anything else in the sense that he is
[10:01] not satisfied with anything else this
[10:04] call to preach is so put upon him and
[10:06] such pressure comes to bear upon him
[10:07] that he says i can do nothing else
[10:10] i must preach
[10:11] it doesn't that compare with what isaiah
[10:13] was saying that
[10:15] what are you because what are you doing
[10:16] you're preaching because because you
[10:18] want to help somebody you want to help
[10:21] somebody get out of there out of their
[10:23] uh their eggshell say it like that
[10:26] and that's how that's so any calling is
[10:28] when you're called of god to be a
[10:31] christian there's something motivating
[10:32] you that you can't you can't not you
[10:35] it's it's pulling you to to get out of
[10:38] the world to get out of your your the
[10:40] way that you think to uh you get to a
[10:42] place of desperation where you've you've
[10:44] got to move on with god
[10:47] martin lord
[10:48] jones said i have always felt when
[10:50] someone has come to me and told me that
[10:52] he has been called to be a preacher that
[10:54] my main business is to put every
[10:56] conceivable obstacle that i can think of
[10:59] in his way isn't that a strange thing
[11:01] because you don't want somebody that's
[11:03] trying to promote their self or their
[11:04] own idea
[11:06] and you know uh being preacher being a
[11:08] preacher is uh
[11:09] well
[11:10] i think i think one of these other
[11:11] quotes references that so i'll just hold
[11:13] on for a second and john newton said
[11:15] none but he who made the world can make
[11:17] a minister of the gospel if the young
[11:19] man has capacity culture and application
[11:22] it may make him a scholar a philosopher
[11:24] or an orator but a true minister must
[11:27] have certain principles motives feelings
[11:29] and aims which no industry or endeavors
[11:32] of men can either acquire or communicate
[11:34] they must be given from above where they
[11:36] cannot be received
[11:38] now see how see why jesus was called of
[11:40] god he was called because god was god
[11:42] actually walking in him and doing he he
[11:45] was god manifested in the flesh and the
[11:47] things that he did and the words that he
[11:49] spoke that you know the people that
[11:51] listen to him said no man i've never
[11:52] heard a man's talk like this before
[11:54] because it was god's using his mouth and
[11:57] using his
[11:58] uh
[11:59] it was he was god manifested in the
[12:01] flesh
[12:02] manifested for us
[12:04] and jc philpott said those whom god
[12:07] calls for the work
[12:08] he usually yeah here's the quote i
[12:10] wanted to get to
[12:13] those whom god calls to the work
[12:15] he usually so strips and empties
[12:21] so pulls down
[12:22] humbles and a basis
[12:24] so shows them what the ministry is
[12:27] and their own unfitness for it
[12:29] that they shrink back from so arduous
[12:31] and important to work
[12:33] and can scarcely be persuaded that they
[12:35] are called to it
[12:36] you know there's there's a pattern in
[12:38] there that it when god forgot to really
[12:40] put a stone where it needs to go
[12:43] first it's got to be it's got to be uh
[12:47] it has to go through some low points now
[12:49] you think about the life of christ when
[12:52] when he was rejected and that they
[12:54] rejected his word and and and
[12:57] struck his back and put him on the cross
[13:00] when they rejected his message that
[13:01] actually put him where he was supposed
[13:03] to be
[13:04] on the cross to fulfill his word
[13:07] now even today when the word was
[13:09] rejected when brother brown preached i
[13:10] indict this generation for rejecting the
[13:12] word that then that place that actually
[13:15] moved the word to where it was supposed
[13:16] to be it placed it so even in your own
[13:19] life for the word actually be put into
[13:22] effect really the way it's supposed to
[13:24] be in your life you've got to come to a
[13:26] really low place where you realize that
[13:29] even in your own self there's nothing
[13:31] there's nothing that you can do you have
[13:32] to rely completely on god so many times
[13:35] god will take you down to and maybe this
[13:37] is not just i'm not just talking about
[13:39] ministers
[13:41] but just everybody that
[13:43] but but also especially ministers that
[13:45] to really
[13:46] to really be effectual he'll bring you
[13:48] down to a low place where you think you
[13:52] you think
[13:54] all sorts of things
[13:56] he strip so strips and empty so pulls
[13:59] down humbles and a basis so shows them
[14:01] what the ministry is in their own
[14:02] unfitness for it that they shrink back
[14:04] from so
[14:05] arduous and important to work and can
[14:07] scarcely be persuaded that they are
[14:09] called to it
[14:11] we need hardly remark how different this
[14:12] is from the forward
[14:14] pushing
[14:15] bold if not presuming spirit which so
[14:18] many manifest in their ambitious aim
[14:21] almost to force their way
[14:23] into the pulpit so god wants somebody
[14:26] that can't do it they can't do it of
[14:28] their own self to preach the gospel
[14:31] j.c riles said i felt shut up to do it
[14:33] and saw no other course of life open to
[14:36] me
[14:37] i couldn't help to do it i couldn't help
[14:39] but do it
[14:40] and c.a spurgeon charles spurgeon said
[14:42] he that can toy with his ministry
[14:43] encountered to be like a trade or like
[14:45] any other profession was never called of
[14:47] god but he that has a charge pressing on
[14:50] his heart and a woe
[14:51] ringing in his ear
[14:53] and preaches as
[14:56] though he heard the cry
[14:59] excuse me
[15:02] the cry of hell behind him
[15:05] and saw his god looking down on him
[15:08] oh wow that man entreats the lord that
[15:10] is here is made out here in vain
[15:18] whatever call a man may pretend to have
[15:20] if he has not been called a holiness he
[15:22] certainly has not been called to the
[15:24] ministry
[15:26] i think that's another thing that maybe
[15:28] maybe sometimes ministers forget about
[15:30] is that
[15:31] brother brown preached in the message
[15:32] influence that if you're called to
[15:34] preach the gospel you're called to a
[15:35] life of holiness so that you can have an
[15:37] influence with the people
[15:38] because you know there's so many that
[15:40] have fallen by the wayside because they
[15:41] got caught up in things and
[15:44] and we're not living a life that you
[15:45] know if paul if paul could say that that
[15:48] if it's going to offend somebody to eat
[15:50] meat
[15:52] i'm not going to do it then how much
[15:54] bolder we should be to to to to try to
[15:56] have an influence where we we stay away
[15:58] from things that will will cause people
[16:01] to stumble
[16:02] because the calling of god is something
[16:04] to be something it's it's an honorable
[16:07] thing and that's why paul said and no
[16:09] man take this honor unto himself
[16:12] but he that is called of god as was
[16:14] aaron
[16:15] so also christ glorified not himself
[16:19] to be made in high priest but he that
[16:21] said unto him thou art my son today have
[16:24] i begotten thee
[16:26] so in john chapter eight jesus answered
[16:28] if i honor myself
[16:31] and it's not true of any if any man any
[16:33] any preacher sometimes you know we we
[16:36] maybe we get
[16:37] we get a little bit sidetracked
[16:39] sometimes and start thinking that that
[16:41] uh our goal is to have people follow us
[16:43] or look at us
[16:44] but our goal is to point back at jesus
[16:46] christ
[16:48] our goal is to point at him and so it
[16:50] doesn't matter how popular you are or
[16:52] how unpopular you are or how many people
[16:55] uh look at you strange while you're
[16:57] preaching or don't look at you strange
[16:59] or getting it or not getting it what
[17:00] matters is that we're preaching the
[17:02] gospel
[17:03] so he said if i honor myself
[17:06] my honor jesus our example now my honor
[17:09] is nothing it is my father that honoreth
[17:12] me of whom you say that he is your god
[17:15] yet you have not known him but i know
[17:17] him
[17:18] and if i should say i know him not i
[17:20] shall be a liar like unto you
[17:23] but i know him and keep his say
[17:26] and again in john chapter 7 and jesus
[17:28] answered them and said my doctrine is
[17:29] not mine
[17:31] but his that sent me see how see how he
[17:33] is our example
[17:35] because this is how we we preach
[17:37] that this is not this is not even the
[17:40] doctrine of william branham that this is
[17:42] the doctrine of the father that we're
[17:43] preaching this is not my doctrine but
[17:46] when we preach the words off of the page
[17:48] and to make it a living reality you this
[17:51] is it's his that sin us
[17:54] if any man will do his will he shall
[17:56] know of the doctrine
[17:58] whether it be of god or whether i speak
[18:00] of myself
[18:01] he that speaketh of himself seeketh his
[18:03] own glory
[18:04] but he that seeketh his glory that sent
[18:07] him the same is true and no
[18:09] unrighteousness is
[18:11] is in him
[18:12] you see how
[18:13] you see why god will take a minister and
[18:16] and mold them down into where they they
[18:18] they're just nothing
[18:20] until they can't they can't do it of
[18:22] themselves because they're not that to a
[18:24] place where they're not looking for for
[18:26] praise or glory or anything because
[18:28] he that seeketh his glory that sent him
[18:30] the same is true and no unrighteousness
[18:32] is in him and jesus said in john chapter
[18:35] 8 and i seek not mine own glory
[18:38] there is one that seeketh and judgeth
[18:41] that's what paul was talking about here
[18:42] and when he says and no man taketh this
[18:44] honor unto himself
[18:46] jesus came on the scene as our example
[18:49] an example of as our high priest to take
[18:52] somebody that we can have confidence in
[18:54] that he was
[18:56] he was everything that
[18:59] that we can rely on
[19:01] in john chapter 5 31 he said if i bear
[19:03] witness of myself
[19:05] my witness is not true
[19:07] there's another that beareth witness of
[19:09] me and i know that the witness which he
[19:11] witnesses of me is true
[19:13] he sent unto john and he bear witness
[19:15] under the truth see he had a forerunner
[19:18] a forerunner to forerun the coming of
[19:20] the son of man
[19:21] but he said but i receive not testimony
[19:24] from man
[19:25] so he's not looking for somebody to give
[19:27] him praise and and and to give him pass
[19:30] on the back
[19:31] and tell him whether or not his sermon
[19:33] was good he said but these things i say
[19:35] that you might be saved he was a burning
[19:39] and a shining light and you were willing
[19:40] for a season to rejoice in his life
[19:43] but i have greater witness than that of
[19:45] john
[19:46] you see what he's saying he said now
[19:48] i've got a man to testify of mia that my
[19:51] that of who i am to that proclaim but
[19:53] but now i'm not relying on that so much
[19:56] i've got a greater witness than that of
[19:58] john and that greater witness like like
[20:01] how paul said we've got a greater
[20:04] uh uh uh uh well i'm i'm drawing a
[20:08] blanket of the scripture
[20:10] a greater witness than that of john for
[20:12] the works which the father hath given me
[20:14] to finish the same works that i do
[20:17] bear witness of me that the father has
[20:19] sent me when he was doing the will of
[20:21] the father the works of the father and
[20:23] god's life was made manifest in him so
[20:25] that the people could see that the eyes
[20:27] of the blind were open and and the lame
[20:30] walked and people heard the word and
[20:32] they he he broke the loaves and the
[20:34] fishes and god's life was manifested in
[20:37] him
[20:38] i've got a greater witness than that of
[20:39] john
[20:41] so he was our high priest
[20:44] and the old testament the primary
[20:45] purpose of the high priest was to serve
[20:47] as a representative and mediator
[20:50] as a representative
[20:51] and a mediator between the people in
[20:53] yahweh
[20:56] it was the high priest's responsibility
[20:58] to see that the covenant was enforced
[21:01] now
[21:02] set this in your mind
[21:04] that don't maybe look so much at think
[21:06] about jesus walking on the shores of
[21:08] galilee but he's our high priest now
[21:11] seated in our heart
[21:13] to do what to see that the covenant is
[21:15] enforced
[21:16] so he's in your heart actually living it
[21:19] out
[21:20] he's when you do wrong he's he's there
[21:22] to say you shouldn't have talked to that
[21:23] person that right that way you need to
[21:25] you need to repent
[21:27] he's there to open up the word to you
[21:29] because he's your he's our high priest
[21:32] as the representative for the nation of
[21:33] israel the high priest had a tremendous
[21:35] responsibility to direct the hearts
[21:37] to change your heart
[21:39] toward god and the fulfillment of the
[21:41] covenant so he's the high priest seated
[21:44] in our heart now
[21:46] like in the old testament how the high
[21:47] priest would go through that outer core
[21:49] inner court holy of holies well now our
[21:51] high priest has done those doing that
[21:53] work to go into our
[21:55] into our heart
[21:57] to change our hearts to see that the
[21:59] covenant is enforced and to be a
[22:01] representative a mediator between god
[22:03] and man
[22:05] throughout the old testament there is a
[22:07] foreshadowing and forward reaching hope
[22:08] of a more perfect high priesthood that
[22:10] can represent god effectively and be a
[22:13] sufficient mediator for the people of
[22:14] israel
[22:15] the cyclical pattern of the lives of
[22:17] good and poor high priest makes it clear
[22:19] that no human being can fully perform
[22:21] his responsibility
[22:25] so paul goes on to say as he saith also
[22:27] in another place
[22:29] thou art a priest forever after the
[22:31] order
[22:32] of melchizedek
[22:34] who in the days of his flesh when he had
[22:36] offered up prayers and supplications
[22:37] with strong crying and tears unto him
[22:40] that was able to save him from death
[22:42] and was heard and that he feared
[22:46] he's a priest now paul doesn't really
[22:48] get into melchizedek until hebrews
[22:49] chapter 7 but we're kind of leading up
[22:51] to that so he's saying he's trying to
[22:53] set in our minds that that they had a
[22:55] high priest after the order of aaron
[22:58] a man that could die and would go in and
[23:00] out of the holy of holies and every year
[23:02] he had to go go in and out but now we're
[23:05] changing over to a priest after the
[23:06] order of melchizedek
[23:08] a a a a priesthood where
[23:11] once into the holy of holies is fine it
[23:14] it finishes the work
[23:15] and this as melchizedek came in the
[23:18] flesh and was manifest to
[23:20] minister to abraham and talk to abraham
[23:23] in the flesh
[23:24] so jesus god was manifested in the flesh
[23:27] of jesus
[23:28] and in the days of his flesh as paul was
[23:30] saying when he had offered up prayers
[23:32] and supplications with strong crying and
[23:33] tears again what's he talking about he's
[23:36] talking about a man that got crushed
[23:38] there in the garden of gethsemane a man
[23:40] that that
[23:42] that
[23:44] i got the little picture there
[23:45] crying out to god father let this cup
[23:47] pass for me
[23:50] so who
[23:51] said and
[23:52] start setting in our mind who is this
[23:54] melchizedek
[23:56] who was that melchizedek when we i just
[23:58] got a little picture to show that
[24:00] melchizedek laying his hands on abraham
[24:03] and blessing him
[24:04] and as bro you know we were just
[24:05] listening to brother branham explaining
[24:07] in that sermon before i before the
[24:09] lesson that melchizedek was god in flesh
[24:12] that god pulled up around that theophany
[24:15] pulled up around all that the pot ash
[24:16] and the petroleum and all that and
[24:18] walked out there and had communion with
[24:20] abraham and sat there
[24:22] and talked with him and identified that
[24:23] he was god by by saying uh where's sarah
[24:27] and tell him what she was thinking and
[24:28] and
[24:29] and and discerning things and telling
[24:31] abraham got up and walked with him and
[24:32] looked over at sodom and gomorrah when
[24:34] he when he came and visited him later
[24:36] and showed him the things that were
[24:38] going to happen
[24:41] but we'll get to that a little bit more
[24:42] when we get to hebrews chapter 7.
[24:45] hebrews chapter 5 where we are he says
[24:48] paul says though he were a son yet
[24:50] learned he obedience
[24:51] by the things which he suffered
[24:54] and being made perfect he became the
[24:55] author of eternal salvation and all them
[24:58] that obey him
[24:59] called of god and high priest after the
[25:02] order of melchizedek
[25:04] though he were a son yet learned the
[25:06] obedience
[25:08] now you think how how could jesus learn
[25:11] to think of a little baby a little baby
[25:12] can't preach but as a little baby keeps
[25:15] eating after a while it can start
[25:17] babbling and after a while that little
[25:19] baby that that's babbling after a while
[25:21] it can it can learn to follow some
[25:23] direction and get out of the road and
[25:24] gets a little popping from his mama when
[25:26] it runs in the road and it keeps on
[25:28] growing so he learned by obedience by
[25:30] the things which he suffered he got a
[25:31] little popping from his mama if he maybe
[25:34] uh
[25:34] played in the road or did something like
[25:36] that but i think one of the examples i
[25:38] like to use there's there's this thing
[25:40] that psychologists like to do
[25:42] with young people with little kids and
[25:45] that's the the picture i have as we're
[25:47] just closing up right here
[25:48] uh that they'll ask a little kid if i a
[25:51] little child if i put water in this in
[25:53] this tall glass and then pour it into
[25:55] this little short squat glass is the
[25:56] same amount of water and a child cannot
[25:59] tell you that it's the same amount of
[26:01] water because they don't have that
[26:02] capacity yet
[26:04] they're not yet at that place to to be
[26:06] able to say it's the same amount of
[26:07] water but but you you do that to a
[26:10] teenager as the musicians come forward a
[26:12] teenager will say that's the same amount
[26:14] of water
[26:15] the older you get the more capacity you
[26:17] have and the older that jesus got in the
[26:20] flesh the more capacity he had to
[26:21] receive revelation from the father and
[26:24] the more the older he got the more he
[26:26] learned and he learned obedience by the
[26:28] things which he suffered the things he
[26:29] went through
[26:31] as god
[26:32] put him into the place that he wanted
[26:34] wanted him to be in and we'll just stop
[26:36] right there as we continue on god bless
[26:39] you saints
[26:41] [Applause]
