[0:04] and for us that is not oh no but that's
[0:51] that's for them they came here we've
[0:54] hadn't seen it crushed it over a little
[0:55] bit maybe a squirrel to run across it
[0:57] but not for a human to walk across
[0:59] that's for sure
[1:00] you know when you saw that picture one
[1:02] time of those boys playing on the
[1:03] iceberg back home in Newfoundland sure
[1:09] is our place you know when they won
[1:13] everything we're doing that in turn they
[1:14] don't but they were doing that in Duluth
[1:18] Minnesota when we were up there when I
[1:20] was with us in January the Lake Superior
[1:22] froze over and the kids just running out
[1:25] of crosses but wait anyhow they know
[1:30] what they're doing we don't do that bro
[1:32] no I don't want it to be - 1700 watt
[1:35] y'all we all said oh yeah
[1:42] that is true not going to be 17 or
[1:45] everything below I have work we're
[1:49] talking about the book of Hebrews but we
[1:51] got into a little something that I think
[1:53] we still need to be talking about just
[1:57] really understand God God who had many
[2:00] times and in many matters that
[2:02] I'm talking about here speaking times
[2:04] passing to the father's by the prophets
[2:06] remember that was the Old Testament has
[2:08] in these last days spoken to us last
[2:11] 2,000 years by his son now the last
[2:15] 2,000 years he's spoken to us in the
[2:18] form of what the Son of God because he
[2:22] was if we were talking last night at the
[2:27] Bible study for those of us that were
[2:28] here there was there was Christ came in
[2:34] three sons names but let me let me go
[2:37] over something else we though because
[2:38] we're looking the same thing right here
[2:42] because you got to start with the son of
[2:44] God that's the creator we talked about
[2:46] that's Jehovah that's God above us
[2:49] that's the spirit God right right
[2:52] alright then this same God comes to be
[2:57] for some man which is flesh and this
[3:03] we're going to put spirit we're going to
[3:05] do like the you know the UH the Jewish
[3:09] people did they do not spell the word
[3:11] God right it's G - D that's they can't
[3:18] they so holy they can't write so they're
[3:22] just gonna put G so we're gonna do G / D
[3:25] so the Son of God spirit god son that's
[3:28] West gun then he comes back this man
[3:31] leave this man leave this flesh man
[3:36] leaves this man comes back yes in the
[3:42] church ages that's the son of God
[3:45] back to what spirit God which is the
[3:51] Holy Ghost
[3:53] and the believer there all right with
[3:57] that Lucy don't know you you can't see
[4:02] that okay so what Jesus was truly
[4:06] telling us he said I came from God and
[4:10] I'm going back to God
[4:14] so anyway telling them story telling
[4:16] truth
[4:17] you and I'm saying why don't watch you
[4:19] not saying why we we come down here
[4:21] where the Word made flesh if we have got
[4:24] excited yes
[4:25] so we come from God theophany yes we
[4:31] come from theophany God we come down
[4:33] here in human flesh now who are we going
[4:35] you said I won back the flesh no there's
[4:38] people in another realm right now that's
[4:40] not in their human flesh they're in the
[4:43] sixth dimension waiting on us to bring
[4:46] again this man the man in the end time
[4:55] the seals hands don't remember this
[5:04] right here was right here but it was
[5:06] what it was rejected so what was
[5:12] rejected being that it was rejected it
[5:17] did not come here and this is your seven
[5:20] churches
[5:22] all right candlesticks
[5:24] that's what he's saying here dot in many
[5:27] times the many matters but under
[5:28] father's by the prophets we're right
[5:31] here now God did say son of man prophesy
[5:36] but if you'll watch in your reading
[5:39] sometimes there'll be a little s only
[5:41] when he's talking to zekiel Ezekiel was
[5:44] a son man you wouldn't need some man
[5:47] with a stunt man talking to a group of
[5:49] people but if you'll notice here once
[5:51] awhile read The Book of Ezekiel
[5:53] mentally insane Son of Man and it'll be
[5:55] half the less it won't be the first part
[5:57] of the sentence and if you'll really get
[5:59] to digging in you'll see that that was
[6:01] God talking not Ezekiel talking that was
[6:04] God doing the speaking all right but
[6:07] nobody can because of that tell the son
[6:08] of God the spirit god this is Jehovah
[6:13] God above us God with us God in us but
[6:18] we get a special part because that this
[6:25] does not need a body change this does
[6:29] not need any kind of redemption
[6:31] it is the Redeemer right this is the
[6:37] Redeemer that's why we look and we see
[6:41] in Revelations 5 the lamb takes the book
[6:48] jehovah sit on the throne live the book
[6:51] in his hand why because he has what is
[6:54] the book the book is a book of names of
[6:58] all the redeemed believers bride not
[7:03] foolish virgin 144,000 not in that
[7:07] section now there's many sections of the
[7:09] look ok you may have to go over that
[7:12] I've been thinking about the winning
[7:14] revelations a pretty sermon long time
[7:17] ago called the book of books if you'll
[7:18] remember that and that's what we are
[7:21] worth a buck now what contain what's
[7:23] contained in the book is all the
[7:25] believers but there's one section that
[7:28] this lay on tape because brother Branham
[7:32] says in Revelations 5 that the lamb
[7:34] comes out from behind the throne he is
[7:36] in the church age is doing his
[7:38] intercessory work so he's coming out
[7:41] from the search ages what is John John
[7:47] says John the bad news I'm trying to get
[7:52] to John the Bagginses behold the lamb of
[7:54] God takes place in the world then John
[7:56] the Revelator go through nations 5 and
[7:59] he says the
[8:00] the tribe of Judah has overcome and he
[8:02] turns and when he turns he don't see a
[8:04] line he sees a lamb that was the lamb
[8:08] the lamb was the son of man flesh does
[8:12] that lay on that flesh on it all right
[8:14] nobody got that it's not confusing in
[8:20] then after this because this is the
[8:26] headstone he comes back in the form of
[8:30] the Son of Man in the seals to give us a
[8:33] body change so this guy doesn't this guy
[8:36] doesn't need a body changing I'm not
[8:37] saying this gun versus that God it's the
[8:39] same guy know the position Jehovah's
[8:42] then he didn't need a body saying he's
[8:45] eternal God he's the one who said let
[8:47] there be with this person in more feet
[8:50] into this person not two people he more
[8:55] feed into that person not not in went
[8:59] into that person yesterday one family
[9:01] anyway he anymore be into the person he
[9:04] would be a more begin to that person so
[9:06] he was revelation was Jehovah then the
[9:10] lamb comes remember in the church ages
[9:15] it's a Gentile Church age really Jehovah
[9:21] doesn't have anything to do with then in
[9:25] the form of Jehovah I thought it was
[9:26] gone above us God with us now is God in
[9:28] us Jehovah's not back up their hand
[9:31] right Jehovah is now in more feed into
[9:34] the people and that book the lamb takes
[9:37] this book of the believers and taking
[9:41] the book that's the opening of the
[9:43] sealed so we must become the son of man
[9:48] in a collective bride form to take the
[9:51] book and then what do we do we take a
[9:54] rapture right right here
[9:58] this doesn't rapture this tractor this
[10:03] was what was missing from the church
[10:07] this was a this is what was missing from
[10:11] the church the body changed the
[10:13] revelation that when he walked how that
[10:15] tenses all how in heaven there's been
[10:17] given unto me but now then this man when
[10:20] he leaves this one comes back and see
[10:27] you got several you gotta look at
[10:28] because he comes back as the son of God
[10:31] to who 144,000 he's not coming to the
[10:34] Son of Man to them
[10:35] kaleil gotta die all right and he's not
[10:39] bringing them to a position of right
[10:43] they lost that remember we preached that
[10:45] long in the force field we they lost he
[10:48] divorced him he can't marry him back but
[10:50] he can't take them in and make them sons
[10:53] and daughters of God indeed what in the
[10:57] form of the 144,000 right now bride
[11:00] they're not right all right so then so
[11:11] then he in the Millennium he comes as
[11:13] the son of David
[11:15] I want to throne
[11:19] a literal throne judging the twelve
[11:22] tribes of Israel just like they were
[11:24] talking last night three travel on this
[11:25] side three on this side three on this
[11:27] side and three on this stuff okay that's
[11:31] the Millennium temple you got gone in
[11:34] the middle with the bride all right and
[11:38] then you've got three you got three
[11:40] three three and three which is 12 times
[11:42] 12,000 trial 12,000 each trial 144,000
[11:47] and as we were saying last night I don't
[11:50] have a quota for it but I just have the
[11:52] Bible does not there's no way that that
[11:55] a person a man head of a household them
[12:00] you got a man
[12:02] and two kids that God's going to rapture
[12:05] that one man and leaving mother three
[12:07] now the wife I might see but you got to
[12:11] remember go back to numbers that's why
[12:14] they call it the Book of Numbers
[12:16] it's because God numbered the people
[12:18] that's where your numbers come from if
[12:21] you want to see how many drive people
[12:22] then traveling come any number Don one
[12:25] time when there was over 600 and
[12:26] something I told you last night 600
[12:28] something thousand men above the age of
[12:31] 20 they never documented females and
[12:35] little children so in the high 44,000 to
[12:38] me is 144,000 men and if they have
[12:42] families will I don't understand about
[12:45] the wife but I promise you one thing
[12:46] God's not gonna take them and leave a
[12:49] five year old or an eight year old or
[12:51] seven year old there's going to be a
[12:53] hundred forty four thousand males come
[12:57] IV males were never number soil be
[13:00] hundred forty four thousand plus but
[13:02] it's going to be a hundred forty-four
[13:03] thousand men that received the Holy
[13:06] Ghost the message of the two prophets
[13:10] coming under the son of God
[13:12] revelation because what is the son of
[13:15] that revelation Jesus died coming died
[13:18] in you in place but you're singing yes
[13:19] now you will you can put that in the son
[13:22] of man - but there's some thoughts the
[13:24] Holy Ghost that's what they receive they
[13:26] receive the Holy Ghost
[13:27] [Music]
[13:29] just like you an idea of anything but
[13:32] remember our position in their position
[13:34] our position we're virgin bride they're
[13:37] not virgin anymore cuz they went out
[13:39] playing the part of the harlot and God
[13:40] can't take them back cuz he came once
[13:43] you defiled you can't be come back
[13:44] alright
[13:47] it's revelation the word love it no it's
[13:51] just like we were talking about last
[13:52] night
[13:53] everybody's regulation that revelation
[13:55] is in degrees we were talking about the
[13:58] fullness and I didn't make this
[14:03] statement but I'll make it now if you
[14:06] have the new birth you're full of God
[14:09] because your whole soul is God there's
[14:12] not a little speck of it that's not but
[14:14] now there's a lot of people leaving the
[14:16] graves that we're all of God but they
[14:19] need a body change so they're not all of
[14:22] God that we have the old gun okay they
[14:24] have a portion just like the ocean just
[14:27] like this cup of coffee
[14:28] I hope cup of coffee but that little
[14:31] drop is the same thing it's what's in
[14:34] that whole cup in America it's a million
[14:36] gallons that one drop right there has
[14:38] the same what's good the same
[14:40] ingredients that's what's in the whole
[14:44] ocean but they're not the whole ocean
[14:46] you and I are the ocean Luther was the
[14:49] drop member brother Ramsey took the dip
[14:51] into the Holy Ghost well it is all
[14:52] adultery and Luther was full of the Holy
[14:55] Ghost right
[14:56] hey what part Holy Ghost he was full of
[14:58] the Holy Ghost but now in this bare
[15:01] ground he was not full to the fullness
[15:08] you and I are the only ones that's gonna
[15:10] be the fullness in our spirit realms and
[15:12] in our in our soul
[15:21] they won't be no no no they've only got
[15:25] three and a half years the book of the
[15:28] book of come on Brandon Zachariah will
[15:32] tell you when they reveal this man Jesus
[15:36] to the hundred forty-four thousand they
[15:38] are going to go in their house separate
[15:43] from their parents separate from their
[15:45] kids separate from everybody they're
[15:46] going to wail for four days just because
[15:50] they realize that you know what they're
[15:53] thinking oh my god we killed me we kill
[15:56] the Messiah the one minute we're looking
[15:58] for we kill me work in other words we're
[16:00] cut off but what does the Bible say no
[16:02] just like Joseph will happen the Joseph
[16:05] when he revealed himself to his brothers
[16:08] that had put him in a pit he revealed to
[16:14] him they said first thing we're gone
[16:17] we're done we're Danny Jones did another
[16:19] no-no if you haven't done this we
[16:22] couldn't him past seven years of good to
[16:24] be with this seven years of bad you God
[16:27] did this to preserve us and you okay
[16:30] that's the same thing he's gonna reveal
[16:32] come to hate God took the Gentile bride
[16:36] they're gone but I'll come back for you
[16:39] because I can't forget you because you
[16:41] got to remember those those two prophets
[16:45] will have to come preaching the Old
[16:48] Testament first they're gonna have to
[16:50] see Christ come out of that Old
[16:51] Testament they can't just walk up and
[16:53] say brother Brown upset right Sam in
[16:57] other words the first thing we'll care
[16:59] cuz we're the Browns not their prophet
[17:01] but now when they see the Moses
[17:04] analyzing ministry come out of them two
[17:06] people they're gonna go hang
[17:07] man we know the ends near because he
[17:10] lives us here okay but what's going to
[17:13] happen to all another jewelry are Israel
[17:16] jewelry not jewelry jewelry is there
[17:19] going to condemn them 144,000 till this
[17:21] because they didn't come to them because
[17:24] what happened when Christ came to the
[17:26] Jews caucus didn't believe it because
[17:29] caucus didn't come to him and say I'm
[17:32] them something brother beretta makes
[17:33] that many many times he makes an analogy
[17:35] that the reason counts them didn't
[17:37] believe who he was it's coach they
[17:39] thought well this watch Messiah is gonna
[17:41] come he's gotta come right here build a
[17:43] temple he's gonna come right here to me
[17:45] and tell me who he is
[17:48] well he did he did and they missed it
[17:51] alright so I hope that helps for this
[17:57] Lexington book of Hebrews demands just
[17:58] if you know Romans was wonderful but I
[18:01] believe Hebrews ties a lot to us coming
[18:04] out of the Old Testament because what's
[18:06] gonna happen is we're gonna get further
[18:07] into this he's gonna revert back to
[18:08] Abraham he's gonna revert back to Moses
[18:11] Hebrews eleven is full of all the Old
[18:13] Testament Saints
[18:15] so there might give this Sun God is
[18:18] Jehovah the one X student said let there
[18:21] be theophany God our spirit died then
[18:28] for four thousand years he continues as
[18:32] that through the Old Testament they're
[18:34] 4,000 years of Old Testament right the
[18:35] very okay with a from there's 4,000
[18:37] years of Old Testament from Genesis to
[18:42] Malachi
[18:43] then there's about four hundred years
[18:45] that there's no prophets remember and
[18:47] then a virgin shall conceive came forth
[18:50] and then now son of God I mean so God
[18:53] has went into flesh and resided he
[18:58] didn't just know he remember he would
[19:00] have known a flesh and then he would I
[19:01] was thinking that's the other day-to-day
[19:04] that Joshua was the top of the Holy
[19:07] Ghost Moses was kind of of another worse
[19:09] he wasn't he was one that brought him
[19:12] out but he couldn't take them in the
[19:13] Holy Ghost
[19:14] same way brother
[19:15] rambro a layout they needed to come out
[19:18] but he couldn't take me and they didn't
[19:20] take him in and thought that he was
[19:21] wrong but he had a position to fulfill
[19:23] he prophesied he was a prophet but
[19:26] Joshua was commissioned to take us in as
[19:29] I was with Moses so I will be with you
[19:31] and Joshua is the holy ghost of this day
[19:34] and that Holy Ghost came to bring us a
[19:38] revelation because brother Graham cannot
[19:41] give you revelation brother Dale can't
[19:42] give you revelation I think you know I
[19:44] can give you a revelation except that
[19:46] guy right there because what did this
[19:48] man say this man nobody understood while
[19:51] he was here totally misunderstood but he
[19:56] said when he the Holy Ghost has come in
[20:00] other words you'll understand what I'm
[20:02] saying to you you may not understand the
[20:04] man standing here but you sure well
[20:05] understand what I'm saying to you and
[20:07] I'm going to be on my church on that yes
[20:10] because truly the rep the church is not
[20:13] built on the seal the church is not
[20:15] built on Dan stammen weak she's not a
[20:17] built on the church is built don't
[20:21] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[20:22] thou shalt be saved that's what the
[20:24] church is built on that's the common
[20:26] denominator from this church journey to
[20:29] this church a right because remember he
[20:32] said well no it's the baptism and all
[20:34] that no remember that baptism went away
[20:36] about right here right
[20:38] God went into ignorance of man but still
[20:41] believe don't know he's cross enough
[20:43] shall be saved
[20:44] Martin Luther believed on the Lord Jesus
[20:45] Christ and he was saved yet he was still
[20:47] a Trinitarian and did Trinitarian things
[20:50] hey if I got that yes so the basis from
[20:54] from the first church age to even our
[20:56] church age even right now believe on the
[21:00] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[21:01] saying now you gotta keep going on to
[21:02] receive the Holy Ghost
[21:03] that's a requirement but it's in major
[21:09] okay it's in measure the Holy Ghost is
[21:12] in measure
[21:13] read the Bible but I will tell you it's
[21:16] in measure alright so now we got we got
[21:20] this gun this is all one man
[21:25] this whole plan is based on one man all
[21:30] right
[21:31] and as brother Dale was talking last
[21:33] night I'm gonna add just a little bit to
[21:35] it he's gonna preach the sermon and it's
[21:36] gonna be really you'll really understand
[21:38] it because one day all that's gonna
[21:40] terminate one day all that's going to go
[21:42] away look look why do you need to over
[21:51] is really glorified body in an eternal
[21:55] place the title not the person the title
[21:59] okay we need a lamb dances over weight
[22:05] you need to whole ago you are the whole
[22:08] to go why you need to seal the nets
[22:11] don't you don't you are oh and of course
[22:17] this Donuts evolved to us but still
[22:19] remember this son of David only is in
[22:23] time it's only during to 1,000 years of
[22:28] the Millennium then that goes away so
[22:37] they won't be on the lingam temple in
[22:39] the new the future home the future home
[22:40] is our place to live God builds it now
[22:45] they might build something outside
[22:46] that's fine with me but the Millennium
[22:50] we build and inhabit us what the Bible
[22:51] said in the future home it's already
[22:54] built it's already done read your future
[22:56] homeless once if you refute your home
[22:57] you can get a lot of documents
[22:58] straightened out just about doing that
[23:00] so what's gonna happen is all these
[23:02] tiles are gonna go away
[23:09] because you don't need redemption after
[23:11] your either you're fully redundant
[23:17] listen you don't need to pray anymore
[23:20] then you do now you understand what I'm
[23:22] saying but but we're not gonna be what
[23:25] are we going to pray for in a glorified
[23:26] body right you there's nothing to brag
[23:31] for you tell me some of the pray for
[23:34] what we pray for our loved one will know
[23:36] not when that happens cause remember
[23:38] redemption is over when you can avoid if
[23:40] I body it's done whatever the way to
[23:42] treat it is go right so that prayers
[23:47] over will
[23:49] there'll be no suffering no sorrow no
[23:51] pain no thinking about bad things one
[23:53] more thing to pass away be told all
[23:54] things to be new so all that will
[24:01] terminate that he will be one person
[24:03] sitting on the throne and us in the city
[24:06] with him and then all the other outside
[24:09] the city will be listen they're so good
[24:11] there's gonna be still a sting come up
[24:13] the road today
[24:15] politics is rotten but government's not
[24:18] yeah the government is on his shoulder
[24:21] if he sits on the throne is the son of
[24:23] David ruling the twelve tribes there's
[24:26] got to be government there if the Bible
[24:28] says in Revelations that the Kings will
[24:30] come in and bring a king that's gotta
[24:33] have some hits drill over so there will
[24:36] be but it won't be like here it won't be
[24:39] like here we got to get on Rohan because
[24:41] when you first thing you say well the
[24:43] king you know he's no but they will be
[24:46] positioned there will be governments
[24:48] outside the city we don't need it it's
[24:52] going to be a lot different than what we
[24:53] think it's gonna be I believe yes I mean
[24:56] we're not going to lose our humanity
[24:57] still human will be able to go outside
[25:01] and walk through the garden I believe
[25:02] that plan will have to we do in a
[25:06] millennium because the sex will plan
[25:09] remember the Bible says we'll plant and
[25:12] harvest and then we'll build a house but
[25:15] we won't give it to our son because it's
[25:16] not a genealogy or general
[25:18] cuz I'll build my house to leave it to
[25:20] Josh just leaves in the storm you don't
[25:23] do that in Millennium there's nothing to
[25:24] leave it to this what I'm telling you
[25:25] things are going to be just totally over
[25:27] when we go in Iraq or when we think
[25:28] about a tank going after there's no need
[25:31] for anything for us anymore it's all
[25:34] good
[25:35] tell me something else we need more work
[25:38] no you are gorg we need more work for ya
[25:43] we'll get ya we'll get a message of
[25:47] cheer down through the ages but what it
[25:48] is that the message of chair is is going
[25:50] through the center that's being given
[25:51] eternal life because of you and your
[25:55] message to him is is this is why you
[25:57] missed it and this one happened and this
[25:58] what Christ died to save me and through
[26:01] me you came in and that's a message to
[26:03] cheer thank about the old man sure we
[26:19] know who that man is on the drum we
[26:20] never will forget that we're sure yeah

[26:26] remember there is no temple then they
[26:30] don't charge church is done there's not
[26:33] even gonna be a temple there brother
[26:35] brother Brown will tell you that and eat
[26:36] your home and even the Bible tells you
[26:38] there's no temple in the left last year
[26:50] let's go to revelations
[26:52] [Music]
[26:56] it is about 20 will start at 22
[27:00] let's just
[27:08] we just read this right here and he
[27:10] showed me a pure river water blob clear
[27:12] the crystals presenting from the throne
[27:13] of God and from the lamp in the midst of
[27:15] the street of it neither side of the
[27:16] river was their Tree of Life bare twelve
[27:18] manner of creeping on and there should
[27:20] be no more curse but the throne of God
[27:22] and the lamb shall be in it and his
[27:23] servants shall serve Him and they shall
[27:25] see his face and his name shall be in
[27:27] their forehead there shall be no night
[27:29] there they need no candle and them the
[27:30] light of the Sun for the Lord giveth
[27:31] them lot less your reign for ever and
[27:33] ever
[27:36] keep going on there is a place where it
[27:41] says there will be a temple neither
[27:48] selling the throne Oh make all things
[27:50] new a mountain when the me going in well
[27:57] we read up later but brother branham
[27:59] tells you and he says look he stood a
[28:01] single been temple in the future home
[28:03] there is a temple in the Millennium you
[28:05] can read that read that Ezekiel 42 44
[28:08] but here there's not there's no Leah
[28:12] stating mystic sector before this verse
[28:14] 22 written and I saw no temple there you
[28:20] know thank you and you other than there
[28:22] somewhere all right let's go back Hebrew
[28:24] so God it's not anytime they just want
[28:26] you to understand it that and not saying
[28:30] this but I any means to Paul was a
[28:34] prophet yes
[28:35] the Paul wasn't I wrote this why I just
[28:37] wrote on this board no he knew this man
[28:44] was but all the positions he didn't know
[28:48] that that's why that's why you and I are
[28:50] not a bunch of know-it-all but we need
[28:53] this to prepare us for anything Satan
[28:57] has the brain right that's what the word
[29:01] does to me the word to me answers and
[29:03] satisfies questions because I have a
[29:07] question now don't you mean - I have a
[29:09] question that I can't walk through that
[29:10] wall line cuz my human mind goes well
[29:13] you're solid where are you this way
[29:15] yours does too
[29:18] I can't do this because now Jesus didn't
[29:21] have that I can't do this because when
[29:23] he got out of the tunnel okay
[29:25] no he just walked right on through just
[29:27] like you wouldn't in black all right
[29:29] well that's the same what's gonna happen
[29:31] to us
[29:32] so God look sometimes dogs manners will
[29:34] never get through the book Hebron hath
[29:37] in these last days spoken to us by his
[29:39] son which is the son of God who has
[29:42] appointed heir of all things by whom
[29:44] also he made the world's so that worked
[29:48] the Christ the Son of the Living God now
[29:50] the Creator the Creator Garko he wasn't
[29:52] just Jesus there was many Jesuses in
[29:55] that date as many hey juices in this day
[29:57] but there was only one Jesus Christ and
[30:00] then we give him the title because
[30:02] remember become a baptism no I in the
[30:05] Bible they were baptized Lord Jesus
[30:07] Christ
[30:08] it was either Jesus name or Jesus Christ
[30:11] his name but brother Branham said we
[30:14] give him his lordship and baptize him
[30:17] and they were baptized in the name of
[30:19] the Lord Jesus Christ that give him all
[30:20] this time okay but baptizing in the name
[30:23] of Jesus Christ is fun come that's what
[30:26] the Bible says now yeah be careful
[30:28] because one place it says baptized in
[30:29] Jesus name that's where the Jesus name
[30:31] people baptized didn't they just say
[30:32] well baptize you Jesus no no Lord Jesus
[30:36] Christ give him the whole title and and
[30:39] gives him possession of you just want to
[30:43] bring that out because you can't find
[30:45] Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible they say
[30:47] no Jesus Christ or Jesus name half of
[30:51] these last days spoken to us by his son
[30:54] whom an appointed heir of all things who
[30:56] Jesus Christ by whom also he made the
[30:59] world who being the brightness of his
[31:00] glory and the Express image of his
[31:03] person in other words when this person
[31:05] right here the first person we talked
[31:07] about them in the Sun God if you were
[31:09] standing there in a expose Brendan said
[31:12] a panorama you would see you don't have
[31:18] a picture Jesus you see Jesus standing
[31:20] there 90 50 years old but you will see
[31:23] Jesus standing there at 20 years old
[31:25] it's time that we got old but that's
[31:28] what you would see because you don't see
[31:30] a different person he
[31:31] these press image of his person if
[31:33] you've seen me you've seen the father
[31:35] now be lying if he's saying I'm
[31:38] something different than my father
[31:40] you've seen me you've seen the father
[31:42] all right this would be the brightest of
[31:45] exploring this press image of this
[31:47] person see this is the problem that that
[31:50] people had and you see the Catholic
[31:54] Church pick it up you see the brightness
[31:57] of his glory no I would assume since the
[32:00] devil did this I would assume that the
[32:02] devil told countless look when this
[32:04] Messiah walks in the door he's gonna
[32:06] have this halo around his head he's
[32:09] going to have this glow emanating from
[32:11] his body because then every Catholic
[32:14] statue or whatever you want to see
[32:16] there's either a halo or there's some
[32:19] kind of fuzzy something around right he
[32:23] was missing that Jesus that was the
[32:26] whole problem he was God revealed in
[32:29] human flesh he didn't need a halo around
[32:31] his head all right
[32:33] or when he walked in a room we just all
[32:35] lit up no he wasn't human man but that
[32:38] was the problem and then like I said
[32:40] when he came to church picks it up every
[32:41] time you see Jesus he's got this halo
[32:43] leaving now they got married with the
[32:44] halo and Jesus with the little thing you
[32:46] know no pelo on his head
[32:47] I don't believe when Jesus was born that
[32:49] was the halo around his head no you got
[32:53] to know who he is not by the signs right
[32:56] not by the Sun you got to know about
[32:59] what in your heart all right so so this
[33:02] is this is God Jesus was the expert the
[33:06] son of man with the expression of God
[33:07] God always wanted to live in human flesh
[33:09] he always did the Express image of his
[33:14] person and upholding all things by the
[33:16] word of his power in other words what
[33:18] Jesus said to God when Jesus said some
[33:20] of the father didn't don't know I mean
[33:22] that no they were the same person so you
[33:24] can't think too difficult and upholding
[33:27] all things by the word of his power when
[33:29] he had by himself purged our sin that
[33:33] remember the son of God the Son of God
[33:35] in the son of man is what cleansed us
[33:40] remember Isaiah 53 52 53 just relieved
[33:46] that report he gave a solo ransom so the
[33:52] soul of God is this the flesh of God is
[33:55] this this is the ransom this is the lamb
[34:06] yes I forgot that
[34:11] he gave his soul a ransom the soul of
[34:14] the Son of Man was another guy before
[34:19] Abraham was I am
[34:22] this wasn't that wasn't right if I got
[34:26] that so the Son of God wasn't ransom he
[34:29] gave us all a ransom so he could see a
[34:31] see not seen natural seen spiritual but
[34:36] he had to come into the land to give his
[34:38] life because remember who took your
[34:43] strives not this person this person did
[34:46] right the lamb took it was a bloody lamb
[34:50] the lamb took your stripes yes the
[34:53] stomach God never had straps he because
[34:55] that's what we got to go back to this
[34:58] never found that he didn't fall but he
[35:00] come into sin he wasn't sinful but he
[35:02] came into sin to redeem us back to here
[35:05] he gave his soul a ransom in this
[35:08] dimension okay because it's easy for one
[35:14] man to die for another but he will
[35:15] totally ransom his soul so that's all we
[35:17] come back into you me given my life for
[35:19] brother Bob would be very commendable I
[35:21] get a Purple Heart it'd be more than
[35:22] that Allah but I did and I can't come
[35:26] back in Bobby making better but if this
[35:28] man come into this man became this man
[35:32] gave his life to ransom your soul and my
[35:36] soul and he didn't just ransom her soul
[35:39] he made us his soul
[35:42] so I came from God me the lack of done
[35:44] that's what you and I are going to do
[35:46] right now right and upholding all things
[35:48] by the word of his power when he had by
[35:50] himself purged our sin he purchased it
[35:53] by what dye don't cross me I said he
[35:56] didn't say son of man can save anybody
[35:58] while he's on earth he did not weigh all
[36:02] of the thief on the cross he took him to
[36:03] paradise he didn't take him to the sixth
[36:07] dimension doing in the paradise actually
[36:10] the person we were talking about last
[36:11] night Stephen was the first person
[36:13] recorded person that died martyr and his
[36:17] soul went into the sixth dimension
[36:18] I said recording may have been another
[36:22] but I think even brother Brown said
[36:24] Stephen was the first martyr being the
[36:26] first martyr he died he went into the
[36:27] sixth dimension which I purged our sins
[36:30] sat down on the right hand of the
[36:32] Majesty on high what'd he do he went up
[36:35] and like Stephen said I see what I see
[36:37] the son of man sitting on her
[36:38] understanding he wouldn't say and he was
[36:40] sick on the right hand of the Father why
[36:44] he came back into his authority he came
[36:45] back into his power right he came back
[36:50] into his power which is all power teller
[36:52] has been giving up the man
[36:53] when he was down here the son of man
[36:54] sure he had control over this but did
[36:57] still die okay but when he came out it
[37:01] was transformed that's what we've got to
[37:02] say that transforming Connor that
[37:04] transformed us here not waiting we'll
[37:07] get into that a little bit this
[37:08] afternoon about tribulation that's why
[37:09] people without the new birds have to go
[37:11] through the tribulation brother Brown
[37:14] said that's their cleansing part they
[37:16] have to give their life because they
[37:18] don't have the life of God inside of
[37:20] them because he's already racks them in
[37:22] you if you're born again today you don't
[37:25] go to hell you know you don't have to
[37:29] worry about the second death right being
[37:34] made so much better than the Angels as
[37:37] he has by inheritance and obtained a
[37:39] more excellent name than they see
[37:41] because the inheritance who got the
[37:43] inheritance not this guy father's give
[37:47] inheritance
[37:48] he gave his inheritance to that flesh of
[37:52] the son of man phone all right if I got
[37:55] that that member brought I read the
[37:56] quote many times brother I said God
[37:58] Jesus Christ inherited the eternal life
[38:01] in his spear in his of flesh didn't have
[38:05] to in its own this and it's and it's
[38:07] buried but his flesh had to be redeemed
[38:09] it had to be made eternal and in being
[38:12] made eternal that's our inheritance that
[38:14] our body can be made eternal obtained a
[38:18] more excellent name than they what then
[38:20] what the Angels he became look he was
[38:24] right here and then you got angels then
[38:31] you got some man he became lower than
[38:37] the Angels yes but now it says here at
[38:39] sea so but now remember the other
[38:40] students who said he became what he came
[38:42] down here lower than the Angels but he
[38:47] was better than the Angels because he
[38:50] got an inheritance they don't get an
[38:52] inheritance he got an inheritance for
[38:54] coming down here to being lower
[38:57] but his name has become higher because
[38:59] the Angels now understand I don't know
[39:02] whether they didn't understand before
[39:03] but I know one thing's for sure brother
[39:05] Brown said in the Bible tells you they
[39:07] do not understand the plan of redemption
[39:08] cuz they never fail and we're redeemed
[39:11] some of them failing they were came back
[39:12] for some of them they don't understand
[39:14] retention they have to be quiet
[39:18] it could be something to is half-hour
[39:20] silence never for the which of the
[39:23] Angels said he at any time thou art my
[39:26] son so you know the angles were his son
[39:28] no no angels are not humans and humans
[39:32] are not brother branham explained that
[39:33] somebody asked him will we be angels
[39:35] over there he said you're a human angels
[39:39] are not human
[39:40] listen even even Satan's not a human
[39:45] all right Brenda which of the Angels
[39:49] said he at any time thou art my son this
[39:51] day have I begotten thee surely didn't
[39:54] ever say that to an angel but he did say
[39:55] to you and me and again I will be to him
[39:59] a father and he shall be to me a son in
[40:01] other words the angels are took them
[40:02] taken out of the equation
[40:03] his father's an son father and son and
[40:06] again when he bringeth and the first
[40:09] begotten into the world not who was that
[40:11] who was the first begotten our firstborn
[40:15] Jesus Christ into the world he said and
[40:18] let all the angels of God worship me
[40:20] what happened on the day that he was
[40:21] born the angels come to the Shepherd's
[40:24] and said Behold right right angels
[40:27] announced a program said in heaven I
[40:29] mean that's an owner come sorry
[40:33] and of the Angels he saith who made is
[40:36] he thanking spirits and his ministers a
[40:38] flame of fire but unto the son he saith
[40:41] thy throne O God is forever and ever a
[40:44] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[40:46] of thy kingdom let's see what that word
[40:49] means in him we'll leave we'll get out
[40:51] of here
[40:52] what do that works let's see what to
[40:56] just see a sticker a wine a rod the
[41:01] staff a walking stick a branch
