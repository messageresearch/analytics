========================================

but nobody knows that on this all right so King Jesus is all in all in the future home we read where that we didn't need a temple we didn't need a light we didn't need these things we don't need a place to live because Jesus King Jesus says all things are finished all things are made new that's not in the Millennium cuz all things are not made new in the Millennium all right now it's a new Heaven and a new Earth because the first Heaven the first Earth's going to pass away in other words there's going to be an atomic explosion and man's fire will burn up the Earth and I call it man's fire the you know the Bible says that man and even the prophet and even in scientific if they'll if they'll agree with it science knows that man's always destroyed himself everything man's done we build a car but yet a car kills more people than any w war that we've ever had for a year uh gunpowder to protect yourself yeah but they use it in wars and rifles and um bombs and okay nuclear power I wish we had more nuclear power but more nuclear power means that we make more nuclear bombs so man can't just stay in that one line of producing something that's good and and it continues on because the Bible says we have no continuing City all right but this city even in the Millennium it's not a continuing City there's only one continuing City that's that future home right there all right whatever is built in the Millennium is going to be burnt off before the future home gets here all right right everybody understand that so Jesus is King Jesus in the future home he's King Jesus to us should be down here but what I'm talking about is dispensations of time because you still have time here this is all eternity everything right is eternity everything I mean from as far down as man went every person on the earth is eternal um in the Millennium there's questions of maybe um somebody's got to live a thousand years it's got to be some human person you and I are not going to fulfill that scripture because we're Eternal before we get to the Millennium I'll read to you in a minute what it is but we showed that in the Millennium we read the scripture last week in in Isaiah 11 I believe it was that uh 11 6-9 or and 97 that he' be the son of David it was promised that David's son would sit on the throne ruling and reigning the children of Israel Israel the 12 tribes the only time the 12 tribes are going to be back in order is when we get into the Millennium when those 12,000 * 12 go into the Millennium they're going to be back in order ready to go all right and then Jesus will sit on the throne as a son of David he's going to be our King Jesus but there's some people that are still dead down here that don't know about this King Jesus right so it's not all in all he's not all in all with this foolish virgin down here in the whatever Dimension they're in fifth or or or or somewhere that they're waiting to be given eternal life and then they can call him King Jesus the reason they the reason they're down there is because they didn't know who King Jesus was that's why we get all in all here if we don't get all in all here then we have to die and go by the grave cuz we can't we can't claim this right we we can't claim son of David right it's either Son of God or son of man we can't claim him a son of David all right cuz remember the cyhan woman she said thou son of David have mercy on me he didn't even pay her any attention but when she said my Lord right brother R said he had to address her then because she approached him right all right and to pray today I don't think you can get down on your knees and say son of David Son of David have mercy on me because he's not your son of David right okay that's to the Jews right okay but see that's why we had to get a revelation of this right here right now right now all in all incompasses Son of God Son of Man son of David but in dispensation of the way the Bible's written we got to go by what the Bible says the way the dispensations are written with the Gentiles I mean with the Jews that we talked about in Daniel 7 weeks with the Jews they turned him down he married the Gentiles took a gentile bride but he promised he'd never forget Israel well here's where he's not going to forget Israel he's going to rule and reign in the Millennium temple in Ezekiel 40-44 they build a temple and he sets in that Temple now we don't need that let me read something to you I ask you to read the future home let's listen to this future home page 30 the Millennium is not the end of it there shall there still be there shall still be time after the Millennium the Millennium is a space of time but not the new Earth no indeed notice and that we'll get to it in a bit notice this is still not referring to this Millennium Reign the thousand years is not the new Earth the Millennium Reign is a different Reign that's what we get into the Millennium but that isn't the new Earth and the new heaven no no that's just a rest period period rest Place see a rest period not at all the new heavens and new earth for see in the Millennium we have things that would not go into that the new heaven new Earth okay that's what he's talking about it's a type of the old seventh day out of Eden the seventh day after he made the world the seventh day he rested in Eden so everybody understand that he he he created man six day six day he created man then he rested the seventh day the 7,000 year he created man all right so we've got what how many years we got up to the flood there was 2,000 years right to Jesus Christ it was 2,000 years and now we've had 2,000 years right so that's 6,000 we're waiting on this cuz this is the seventh day seventh day rest cuz Jesus I mean U Jesus said come unto me all you labor and heavy heavy laden I'll give you rest that's the so person but there is a seventh day rest for this Earth that hasn't come yet we're waiting on that last thousand years to fulfill everything all right after he made the world the seventh day he rested in Eden now let's go to paragraph 62 or page 62 while it's going through the Millennium it's going through its sanctifying process but still must be burned which the blood redeemed the people it show is memorial the bride shall take that thousand years but then it has to be cleansed by fire just like you were his delegates of the city the delegation so if you die if you live what difference does it make if he comes tomorrow comes 100 years or a thousand years I only rest until my change comes questions and answers 1964 will there be sin on Earth during the time no there will not be sin on the earth Satan is bound somebody ask him a question would it be sin on the earth at the time of the Millennium no won't be S on the earth and will there be people on Earth in Corporal bodies during that time yes sir we will have our glorified body right here on Earth eating drinking building houses and living just like we do now for a thousand years it's the honeymoon of the bride and the groom now continuation of questions and answers 1964 um a week later this is 83064 time never ceased until this must be a post-millennial or something that asked this question because see we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the Earth then time ceases in the new Heaven and new earth now the Millennium is not the new Heavens in New Earth there will still be sin after the Millennium the Millennium is a type of Noah going in the ark and carried over and brought ham and them on the other side and sin even come out of the Ark see but Enoch the translated one was the type of the Bride that went up not the one that was carried over so sin will still be on the other side of the Millennium but not during the Millennium during the Millennium is peace but sin will be dealt with on the other side of Millennium and then time Fades out you see what he's saying there won't be sin on the on the Earth but sin will still be here he said sin will have to be dealt with right here all right it's to be white Throne judgment those sins got to be dealt with when right here so he's not saying that there's going to be Sinners on the Earth but there there's going to be as long as the devil's here there's going to be sin cuz he's an unbeliever all right but when he is thrown in the Lake of Fire and we the the city comes down which we'll get to in a little while then sin is dealt with cuz sin is De dealt with at the white Throne everything comes together right there at the white Throne judgment all right but this is still in a seventh day rest this is still in time but yet he reigns as the son of David this is our honeymoon right the brid's honeymoon but now that's not our honeymoon here this is our home in June got married in a church we went on a honeymoon to Pigeon Forge um Tennessee but Pigeon Forge Tennessee wasn't our home we come back we come across the threshold and we walked into our new home right so that's what God's going to do with the bride he's giving us a honeymoon here we stand at this white Throne judgment and this is going to be make it better our Eternal all right so we got son of David to the Jews then he's King Jesus all in all Brides honeymoon in the Millennium but this is our Eternal home this is not our Eternal home home in the Millennium somebody's going to live that thousand years to prove that the sin curse is over for what the people when the devil loo for a short time where is that in the chart is that before the white it's right in there because what happens uh we'll read it um not this Sunday probably but the Bible says that the Battle of go and May that Satan brings his forces up out of maybe the fourth or fifth dimension and he tries to take over the Lord takes us out on the breath of the earth and then the Holy Fire of God Falls well see you can say well where does that happen really doesn't matter to us but somewhere in here is where it's going to happen it's going to happen after the Millennium and before the future home so whatever order you want to put it in there's one thing for sure once it's burned off in that battle of Gog and Magog you got to remember that starts into eternity so it really doesn't matter you say well it doesn't say verb Adam in the Bible it says we'll be taken down on the breath of the earth God's going to reain his fire Holy Fire which will kill Souls then remember the Bible says fear the one that can kill the soul not the body Jesus Jesus Jesus well I don't say Jesus y'all know who Jesus is God's the only one that can kill the soul right right he who made it can kill it right okay so God will will judge the people and actually their Soul's not going to be killed at the whiteone Judgment they're going to have to go through a torment for a time and then their soul is just going to one day it's just going to go out of existence right what a horrible thing there's nothing on this Earth worth that we're going to get into that maybe this afternoon there's nothing on this world worth losing your soul for just to go out and just be nothing anymore just be like you never were here right you just go completely out of existence or you can accept him and live for eternities upon eternities upon eternities and and enjoy the joy of the Lord so a lot of people can't take that but that's our promise so it's a bright honeymoon nothing of judgment all right now the Bible says that he'll sit on his throne and judge the 12 tribes of Israel there's a lot of things see there in the Millennium that you can do with the Jews but not with us because remember we're Eternal all we're here for is a honeymoon right remember when you went on your honeymoon if some of you got to go to a nice Motel I mean they took care of everything everything was done if you were able to have you know somebody come in and and make your beds and you know fix your meals and and you know you didn't you didn't go on the honeymoon and do all the cooking you're not supposed to have went and done all the cooking let's put it that way let's let's just say in a fantasy world in a fantasy world in a fantasy world you would have went to a um resort resort or um a Hilton and just said bring me room service for 3 days I ain't even going to look out the window okay well that's what it's going to be in this honeymoon we're going to be there things are going to be going on around us that we really don't have to understand I don't think because there's a lot of things because remember we're still in they're still in time you and I are not we're going to be in BL right we don't have to worry about living a thousand years but what we're going to be there though we've got to be there to prove all what the Bible's talking about right but it's not going to be like living here you missed the quote yes sir we will have glorified bodies right here on Earth eating drinking building houses and living just like we do now for a thous years the atmosphere around is going to be horrible is it B right no but we're still going to live here we can be the example right like we do for thousand for the Jews sure so you got to remember the Jews missed him right and for this whole Millennium time I believe that's why the temple see the Temple's going to be built Ezekiel 40-44 and I'm glad that a prophet brought the message to show us that that was a real literal Temple that's not just you know you say well look this ISS a new Heaven and a new Earth you know and but watch what God does in Ezekiel 42:44 he tells the exact dimensions right of the courtyard of the we know it's going to be outer Court inner Court holy of holies right but there'll be no sacrifices made nothing to be killed but what a glorious time you can take somebody in a Jew in and say hey y'all built all this in this first court let me explain to you how it affected my life right my literal life not the pots and the pans and the hanging of this and the C golden candlesticks and and the the the Ark of the Covenant cuz when we walk in the holy of holies brother brandom right here in uh um six-fold purpose in the six-fold purpose Daniel 78 1961 what is the most holy to my way of sining which I believe I can prove it by the scripture is to anoint the most holy which will be the temp the Tabernacle that will be used during the Millennium described in Ezekiel 40-44 let's find out a picture in the Millennium how they will anoint the temple well we know what we know who that is right now watch 119 description of the temple that is to be built he's actually getting ready to read but you doesn't read all of it 40 through 44 description of the temple is to be built in the Millennium now everyone anyone any reader knows Ezekiel 40 the 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter there's nothing in the world but the Millennium temple being erected on Earth when the glory of the Lord fills it and so forth like that and it's described in the 43rd chapter 1-6 and what it is to me it's a prefigure of this it's a prefigure of the future home but now remember this we're not going to build this is going to be built the Millennium Temple I don't have it written up here but the Millennium Temple is going to be built it's too much saying about how we're going to build and build and build for it not to be but if read Ezekiel 40344 and then read in Revelation 22 or 20 22 it gives you the dimensions remember 1500 M square and it's going to be Jasper and gold and all that stuff you see part of that in the Millennium the future home the only thing is not going to be is it's not going to be a outer Court inner Court holy of holies Temple because when we get right here King Jesus is going to set on one Throne right we're not going to need justification sanctification baptism the holy go they're already going to be Eternal all right but we can walk through this Millennium and teach I believe sit down under a tree and just teach these Jews or or whoever if they got Heathen raised up in the Millennium brother randam said one time that that a a heathen will be raised up in the Millennium and a gospel will be preached to them don't ask me about that I know one thing's for sure that's not going to happen here right that's why he said he said I can see a lot of things happening in the Millennium that I can't see happening in future home they asked him one time they said will babies be born in the Millennium he said looks like you can looks like you can because that one scripture I just read for a baby a baby there'll be no babies right here it won't be a baby in this future home everybody will be 18 to 20 years old full grown Millennium I don't know one thing for sure the bride will be a 18 to 20 years old the 144,000 will be 18 to 20 years old cuz they get a change just like we did and go in a Rapture they come back and build that Millennium Temple and then we walk into it that's what he was proven in Daniel 70 week the last half of that week after the Rapture the last half of that first half of that week they get the gospel preached to them the last half of the week is when they come back I believe and build a millennium Temple cuz you got to battle of Armageddon then they come right back here cuz he's going to set there when you walk in the holy of holies in this temple in the Millennium that's where your son of David's going to be setting which will be Jesus Christ all right but right here the Bible say we read it last Sunday that there'll be no Temple there'll be no need of a temple because the Tabernacle the Bible says of God is now with who man just like he wanted it before he wanted the Tabernacle he didn't want us to build these outter Court inner Court holy of holies he didn't he he didn't want us to go through the things that we went through but we did because we fell and he was a savior A Healer a redeemer and the only way he can do it was bring us back by that process that's right all right so you your hand up uh in the Millennium the biggest thing to me is right there the Earth is not going to be the same as it is right now no no it'll be burnt over all this stuff will be atmosphere everything else is going to be different yeah so all these other things can come into play right or it never would it wouldn't been you have the only thing I see now you're talking about atmosphere yeah I believe it'll look just like this without a fall right um but I believe if you plant seed it's going to grow yes sunlight's going to make it grow it ain't going to be that you're going to say hey tree now start growing with my finger no in the Millennium is going to be back to like the Garden of Eden was but remember in the Garden of Eden Satan was there right right he just couldn't do anything until Eve done what she did Satan was in the garden IM Meed you believe that sir let's read and let's let's prove that let's go to Ezekiel just came to my mind so let's read it I think it's Ezekiel you have to help me find it 28 20 something or 28 the prince of TI 28 yeah I just read it yesterday this is talking about chapter 28 of Ezekiel if you've never read this before read it there was a man there is a place called Ti t y r e a literal place there was a literal King all right but now listen this King look at verse 13 this natural king of Tyre never was in the Garden of Eden but thou Hast been in Eden the Garden of God so who's he talking about the devil he said you were there but look at 18 thou has defiled thy Sanctuary by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic now this is talking about a natural city which done this cuz remember God destroyed TY but listen therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee and it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in sight of all them that behold thee remember in Isaiah we're going to walk by the devil one day and say is this the man right just some little swiveling little shrimp laying on side of a road we're going to say is this the man that brought kingdoms to their knees what talking about the devil right but this is Satan's end verse 19 all they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore and I wrote in my my Bible the end of Satan that's what he is that's the end of Satan now what we got to do is is bring that into our life we bring that into our life that's right and show Satan's end in you and I but there Satan was in that proved that he was in the Garden of Eden but Satan's going to be bound in this Millennium by Chain chain of circumstances that he can't work he was bound by Chain of circumstances in the Garden of Eden until Eve came out from behind the word that proved that man could not keep that Covenant that God said if you do this you'll be okay if you don't do that you'll surely die they did that and died but here in the Millennium to prove the sin Cur
