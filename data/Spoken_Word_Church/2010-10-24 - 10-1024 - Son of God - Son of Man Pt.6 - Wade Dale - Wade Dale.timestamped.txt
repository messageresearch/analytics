[0:00] and very truthful all the politicians
[0:02] yeah
[0:06] well let's turn to Isaiah 53.
[0:10] I didn't see a room full this morning
[0:13] it's good to have you back out
[0:18] though it's not good to have Jim's backs
[0:21] out so I'm not going to say that it's
[0:23] not good to have her back out couldn't
[0:25] have all of you back out
[0:28] no he was gone I've been in Mississippi
[0:31] since Thursday so I don't blame me
[0:36] but anyway
[0:38] Isaiah 53 last week we were
[0:42] talking a little bit about
[0:45] um
[0:47] the scripture here
[0:49] showing who this person that we're
[0:52] discussing
[0:53] how he has developed in Isaiah 53
[0:58] Isaiah is truly speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:01] the son of man but he also ends up
[1:03] showing that the one that really the one
[1:07] that paid the price
[1:09] was the soul of almighty God the body
[1:12] was the sacrifice the body was the one
[1:14] to look at like the lamb but in the Old
[1:17] Testament the lamb would die and that
[1:19] life would go out of the lamb but that
[1:21] life couldn't do anything to help the
[1:23] human because human life
[1:25] and animal life can't coincide
[1:28] brother Branham said animals have a
[1:30] spirit that they can move and breathe
[1:33] and and be be held by nature and and be
[1:38] influenced by nature but the same bird
[1:42] that built that built a nest before the
[1:44] ark
[1:46] that same Bird's building the same nest
[1:48] now
[1:49] after four or five thousand years
[1:50] they've not evolved because they don't
[1:52] have a soul they don't have an
[1:54] intelligence to do things better
[1:56] but man has that intelligence and in
[1:59] Genesis 3 God said look uh
[2:02] in other words
[2:04] animal blood's not going to do it I'm
[2:05] gonna have to come do it see to the
[2:07] woman I'm gonna have to come and be the
[2:09] one to make the ultimate sacrifice
[2:12] the ultimate sacrifice you say well
[2:15] what about the body well now in Paul's
[2:18] writings Paul said though I give my body
[2:20] to be burned
[2:22] in other words that doesn't make any
[2:24] difference
[2:25] it's the soul is what matters right
[2:28] but now remember one thing whatever the
[2:29] soul is the outside person is going to
[2:31] act like that
[2:32] okay so it's not going to be a different
[2:34] you're not going to be clean inside and
[2:37] dirty outside or vice versa you're not
[2:40] going to be clean inside and dirty
[2:41] outside or by our our dirty inside and
[2:44] then that you can act clean but
[2:45] somewhere down down the road you're just
[2:48] going to catch up with him but this
[2:50] person here in verse
[2:52] four and all through here
[2:55] that was the man Jesus Christ Jesus that
[2:57] came to Earth
[2:58] the son of man the one that came to give
[3:01] his life
[3:04] that body was bruised broken not broken
[3:07] but bruised
[3:08] um striped
[3:10] for our healing for our for our example
[3:15] but the real part the body of Jesus
[3:19] after 72 hours if that Soul had not come
[3:22] back into that body that body would have
[3:25] rotted and died I mean it was dead but
[3:28] it would have rotted and went away right
[3:30] just like man has done for a year
[3:33] millions and years even Lazarus Lazarus
[3:35] was raised from the dead
[3:37] but Lazarus one day died and that Soul
[3:39] left that body and somewhere in the
[3:41] ground as Lazarus body on this Earth
[3:43] somewhere
[3:44] that it just went away
[3:47] back to the dust that he came from
[3:48] because you know God told him said from
[3:50] dust you come from dust you'll return
[3:53] but the soul lives on and that's why
[3:56] that Isaiah comes to this part what we
[3:58] were talking about last Sunday
[4:00] verse in verse 8 he was cut out of the
[4:02] land of the living for the transgression
[4:04] of my people would be stricken
[4:06] I lend you this human mortal man was
[4:09] going to go through some horrible times
[4:10] he was going to go through some things
[4:11] that probably you and I couldn't stand
[4:16] but it was not going to be that
[4:20] he gave his body a sacrifice that's what
[4:23] he did but the soul had to come back
[4:26] into that body to prove who he was to
[4:29] prove that that eternal life come back
[4:32] into that body quickened or changed that
[4:34] mortal body
[4:35] there's the proof
[4:37] that he was almighty god brother Brown
[4:39] said he said the resurrection proved
[4:41] that he was God
[4:43] because Balaam could do signs and
[4:45] wonders there could be many things
[4:47] they'll look at kaifa said there in the
[4:50] in the New Testament
[4:51] when um Nicodemus came to him and there
[4:55] were some of the Pharisees talked about
[4:56] Jesus and he said in other words he said
[4:59] hey there was a guy come through here
[5:00] one time remember and led 400 out in the
[5:02] desert and he had this big following and
[5:04] we never heard from him anymore said if
[5:06] this guy's the same way said
[5:08] it won't matter but if he is if it's of
[5:11] God you can't fight against it which was
[5:14] very much wisdom on gamalia's part and
[5:16] and uh
[5:18] and Nicodemus was pardon brother Brown
[5:20] said they'd be giving eternal life for
[5:21] that for standing up in other words he
[5:24] was telling them said look if this is a
[5:25] God why are you fighting it right
[5:29] but the only proof of that is either
[5:31] what happened was when Jesus Resurrected
[5:36] not even the disciples believed it
[5:39] right not even the disciples believe it
[5:42] so so confused and all them and the
[5:45] Roman generals they were like hey let's
[5:46] make up this story
[5:48] that his body was stolen and taken away
[5:52] and and he really didn't die and let's
[5:54] formulate this story
[5:56] and that story still stands in Tradition
[5:59] now right 4
[6:02] 000 years later it still stands as
[6:04] tradition
[6:05] saying that this man couldn't come
[6:07] because listen people we know as far as
[6:11] as intellectual people and even people
[6:13] one nine and a half cents the old saying
[6:15] goes that if a man is dead and buried
[6:17] and gone and was beat the way he was and
[6:20] then all of a sudden three days later
[6:21] you saw that same man standing and he
[6:24] would disappear and walk through the
[6:25] wall and do all these things Yeti would
[6:27] eat and he was with him for 30 or 40
[6:29] days so they saw him do a lot of human
[6:31] things right I don't think he did as
[6:34] many human things as he did before you
[6:36] know as far as having to eat having to
[6:38] to uh you know go to the bathroom just
[6:40] be honest but he was in a glorified
[6:43] condition but they saw a human body that
[6:45] was solid because they probably had
[6:47] their own idea like brother Branham did
[6:49] he said I really thought that we would
[6:50] just when we died we would just float
[6:53] around on a cloud and brother now would
[6:55] Float by remember he said brother never
[6:57] Float by he said but I couldn't shake
[6:58] his hand because he was thinking of a
[7:00] ghost right a spirit a spook like you
[7:04] know Casper the Friendly Ghost if you
[7:05] want room or whatever but that's not
[7:08] true
[7:09] that soul that this Soul right here went
[7:12] to hell and paid the price for you that
[7:13] was an absolute that was God right that
[7:17] was God in theophany form but he was in
[7:19] a body he didn't go down there as a as a
[7:21] pulsating
[7:23] um light right
[7:25] right he went down there as God
[7:29] the devil recognized him because he said
[7:31] you know brother Brown paraphrase and
[7:32] said I got you now
[7:34] you know you're down here so he
[7:36] recognized who he was he knew the
[7:37] presence hey the devil is the anointed
[7:40] cherub he knows when the presence of
[7:41] God's coming that's why he gets in front
[7:44] of me and you when God gets ready to do
[7:46] something the devil will try to cut that
[7:48] offline
[7:49] he's the anointed cherub he knows that
[7:51] anointing is coming and he's going to
[7:53] try to cut it off that's right all right
[7:56] man isn't that true you try to do
[7:58] something for God and watch watch The
[8:00] Devil take over or try to take over but
[8:04] that's what happened in hell he went to
[8:05] hell and paid the price in other words
[8:06] he looked the devil straight in the eye
[8:08] and said I'm in other words paraphrasing
[8:10] he said look I'm going back up
[8:13] and I'm going to get in that body that I
[8:15] lived on earth then that you didn't
[8:17] believe was the son of God
[8:20] because he said if you be the son of God
[8:22] make these stones in the bread if you be
[8:24] the Son of God right see he really
[8:26] didn't know and Satan don't know I mean
[8:28] there's certain things he don't
[8:30] understand or he'd be our brother he can
[8:33] talk about God like we do right there's
[8:35] certain things that God has just
[8:36] absolutely uh Satan doesn't have the
[8:39] mind of God right we have the mind of
[8:41] God so we can comprehend what God has
[8:43] given us Satan can't comprehend that and
[8:46] that's what he hates he's trying to kill
[8:48] me and you he's trying to get us to slip
[8:50] up and and trying to get us to say that
[8:52] we're not saved and trying to get us to
[8:55] say we're not bride and we're not filled
[8:56] with the Holy Ghost he's trying his best
[8:58] because if he can get us he's got
[8:59] everybody else in the whole wide world
[9:01] that's right that's why the prophet said
[9:03] his guns are trained on this end time
[9:05] bride because he knows he ain't a dumb
[9:07] and he he knows there ain't no more
[9:09] Church ages he can read the Bible he was
[9:11] standing there when the Bible would roll
[9:12] right so he knows there's no more Church
[9:15] agent that's right he's just trying to
[9:17] get up enough Force to disbelieve I mean
[9:20] he disbelieves the word of God he's just
[9:21] trying to give up enough Force over
[9:26] but this man went down to Hell
[9:28] and theophany form well who was that
[9:33] Son of God that's right the Creator God
[9:35] the one that was before the foundation
[9:37] in the world
[9:38] the one that said let there be the one
[9:40] that come all the way down Jehovah all
[9:43] the seven compound names those are names
[9:45] but his name was Jesus see it wasn't
[9:48] revealed until the New Testament came
[9:50] out
[9:50] and an angel
[9:52] told Mary and then Mary spoke it on
[9:54] human lips and it became the truth Son
[9:57] of God there's many jesuses there's many
[9:59] Jesus's today we got plenty of Jesus
[10:02] working for us you know and which in
[10:05] English is Jesus that's right
[10:08] but this son of God is the one that went
[10:12] down to
[10:15] to give his life
[10:17] because
[10:20] the Bible said he gave his soul a ransom
[10:24] so if if somebody stole
[10:26] you know cooked June and
[10:28] and held her they'd want something for
[10:30] if they were going to hold her for a
[10:32] ransom
[10:34] they'd want something for it
[10:36] right
[10:37] you still a rich kids
[10:39] you know a rich man's child
[10:43] you holding for ransom so what do you
[10:45] want you want payment
[10:46] to get him back
[10:48] so Satan had dibs on our body
[10:51] he had dibs on the earth because the
[10:53] Lord said I can't strive with man
[10:55] anymore in other words I can't come down
[10:57] in the cool evening like I did with Adam
[10:59] and Eve because you've sinned and you've
[11:01] made a gap for a division
[11:03] but I'm going to come back at the seat
[11:05] of the woman which he did and then that
[11:06] seed of the woman
[11:08] in that seat of the woman was many seeds
[11:10] it's not one it's not many seeds like we
[11:13] think of many seeds as in human beings
[11:16] but the bottle says one seed which is
[11:18] Christ so that one seed Christ went to
[11:20] hell paid the price and guess what you
[11:23] and I were in that body right if you're
[11:25] born again today if you're not you
[11:27] weren't
[11:28] right that's why if you don't have
[11:30] Christ in your soul
[11:32] you got another trip to hell to go you
[11:34] got a trip to hell to go all right the
[11:36] ones that are already Born Again has
[11:37] already been to Hell right we were there
[11:40] in him right so what did he do to the
[11:43] devil
[11:45] he he figuratively there's not a set of
[11:48] keys to death in hell right but a key is
[11:50] an interim there's a way to get in right
[11:52] it doesn't matter you have that door
[11:54] there and say well I own that door and I
[11:56] own everything behind it
[11:58] unless you got a key to get in
[12:02] you can't get through the door but if
[12:04] you got the kids the easiest thing in
[12:05] the world to stick that thing in there
[12:06] and listen to those tumblers click click
[12:08] click
[12:09] door unlocked so Jesus picked up the
[12:12] keys of death and Hell from Satan what
[12:14] do you do he took the ability
[12:17] this is what happened to Calvary he took
[12:19] the ability
[12:22] of Satan to get you
[12:24] away from him you say well why didn't it
[12:27] stop right then
[12:28] it works on both ends right
[12:31] we got a part to do it yes sir it's like
[12:33] I said about the senator he voted God
[12:36] voted for you the devil voted against
[12:38] you now who swings the vote you do it's
[12:42] either two to one over here or two to
[12:43] one over here right
[12:45] and you think that's simple but that's
[12:47] exactly what it is
[12:49] you took God's plan and said I'll take
[12:52] it I'll take the way with the Lord
[12:54] despised you I've started with Jesus and
[12:56] I'm going through or you can say like
[12:58] brother round said the other day I saw
[12:59] him or listening to him
[13:01] um
[13:02] in the uh
[13:04] 1954 series he said
[13:08] if you know I take every Spirit here
[13:09] under my control for the glory of God
[13:11] for the glory of God and uh
[13:15] he said now if you say this is the
[13:18] spirit of the devil
[13:20] he said tonight you'll get the devil's
[13:22] reward
[13:23] but if you say it's the spirit of God he
[13:26] said tonight you'll get God's reward
[13:28] that's right so see there's your vote
[13:30] God was there to heal everybody in the
[13:33] building but if they took it as a
[13:34] different Spirit or another spirit
[13:39] they're not gonna get anything right
[13:41] so when God went to hell and paid the
[13:43] price
[13:45] as brother random said kick Satan over
[13:46] into the into the pit and took the keys
[13:50] and brought him up with him well now
[13:53] when he resurrected he said all power
[13:55] having a nurse been given unto me
[13:58] and then I thought in John 14 he said
[14:00] that whatever I'll do you'll do
[14:04] so who's got the keys to death and how
[14:06] you and I do this right you and I now
[14:09] have the keys to death in hell
[14:11] all right because
[14:13] um let's just put it simple God don't
[14:14] need them
[14:17] we need them we need to realize he gave
[14:20] them to us
[14:21] because he don't need them
[14:23] he died in that flesh one time for all
[14:26] the Bible says and that's all he's got
[14:27] to die
[14:29] and the soul never died because it's
[14:31] Eternal but that Soul come back into me
[14:32] and you and connected
[14:35] as a believer
[14:37] and now you can't die
[14:39] so you do have the keys to death and
[14:41] hell you say oh but we'll put we've been
[14:42] putting them in the ground
[14:45] they put Jesus in the ground right
[14:47] but one day there's something going to
[14:49] strike the Earth
[14:51] to where that there's got to be a group
[14:54] of people that won't die
[14:55] simply because they somebody has to call
[14:59] the Resurrection The Resurrection has to
[15:00] be called by live people that's right
[15:02] can't be called by dead people it has to
[15:04] be called by people that are alive we
[15:06] which are alive and remain Paul says
[15:08] right to the coming of the Lord
[15:11] and that word remain if you'll look that
[15:13] word remain up it's a pretty good word
[15:15] to look up
[15:16] he didn't say we but you're alive he
[15:18] said we which are alive and remain
[15:21] shall be caught up to meet the Lord in
[15:23] the air well see he come back through
[15:25] here and he said he gave his soul verse
[15:27] 10 and it pleased the Lord approves him
[15:29] he has put into grief when thou shalt
[15:32] make his soul and offering for sin
[15:35] in other words Jesus went to hell and
[15:36] said Satan from now on
[15:39] I'll cover every one of my children
[15:41] everybody that believes on me everybody
[15:45] that loves me I'm going to protect them
[15:47] you can do whatever you want to to the
[15:49] body because you still have claim on
[15:51] that body from back in the beginning
[15:53] when he said serpent told the serpent
[15:55] he'll eat dust for the rest of his life
[15:56] well that's what he's doing he's eating
[15:57] our dust serpents don't eat dust don't
[16:00] eat dirt
[16:01] he was telling the serpent he said hey
[16:03] you can have their bodies
[16:06] remember brother Brown said that he's a
[16:07] squatter he's a temporary squatter he's
[16:09] on our property that's not what's
[16:11] supposed to happen
[16:13] Adam would have become Eternal in his
[16:15] body even
[16:16] he would have went through a change
[16:19] because look whatever happened in the
[16:21] Garden of Eden spares 6 000 years or
[16:23] whatever
[16:24] it's what's happening it's what's going
[16:26] to happen now right
[16:28] Adam let's just put it this way Adam and
[16:30] Eve the the Christ and his bride were
[16:33] going to bring forth children
[16:36] to live on this Earth Eternal in Body
[16:38] Spirit and soul in a Garden of Eden
[16:40] condition where the where the animals
[16:43] didn't you know didn't look at you as
[16:45] dinner or the snakes didn't bite you and
[16:48] all those things well guess what
[16:50] that's exactly what happened when God
[16:53] said I'll put enmity in other words he
[16:54] said I'm going to withdraw myself from
[16:56] man like I wanted to but when I come I'm
[17:00] going to put it right back together like
[17:01] it's supposed to been right which will
[17:03] be the second Adam and the second bride
[17:06] which would be Christ in this church
[17:09] doing what birthing children
[17:12] Sons and Daughters of God birthing
[17:14] children through the through the church
[17:15] ages seven Church ages all right
[17:18] birthing children
[17:19] just like they should have been except
[17:22] Satan had has got dibbed on this flesh
[17:24] body because now we're looking all
[17:26] getting older so the effects of the
[17:28] curse are still with us but one day that
[17:30] the fact that the curse is going to be
[17:31] over and we're going to be standing back
[17:33] in the Garden of Eden back where the
[17:35] animals eat grass back where we don't
[17:37] have to eat if we don't want to but we
[17:39] eat because we love to and we want to
[17:41] drink the water and and you know and
[17:43] we'll have a bride right
[17:45] it'll be crushed in this bride just like
[17:47] it was before but just like because like
[17:51] I said Redemption is not dropping even
[17:53] dropping this and picking it up and
[17:55] putting it over here
[17:57] no you got to restore this back to its
[17:59] original condition which is right here
[18:02] I mean God said I will restore he didn't
[18:05] say I'll restore Parkway he said I'll
[18:08] restore it back to where it was
[18:10] that's why brother Brandon can stand and
[18:11] say he said everything was in the Garden
[18:13] of Eden right
[18:14] and we're going back to the Garden of
[18:16] Eden
[18:17] right back to the Garden of Eden all
[18:20] right
[18:21] so that's what this happened at in a
[18:25] stage where he had to take those keys
[18:27] away from Satan
[18:29] to start birthing his children
[18:32] he had to come back and pick that body
[18:34] up
