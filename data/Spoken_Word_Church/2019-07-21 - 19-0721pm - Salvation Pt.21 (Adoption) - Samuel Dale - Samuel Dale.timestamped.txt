[4:52] saved through faith
[4:53] and that not of works that now just say
[4:56] excuse me it is the gift of God okay
[4:59] back up just one page and we'll start
[5:01] verse 3 chapter 1 seasons let's be the
[5:05] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[5:07] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[5:08] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[5:11] Jesus according as he had chosen us in
[5:14] him before the foundation of the world
[5:18] that we should be holy and without blame
[5:20] before him in love having predestinated
[5:23] us unto the adoption of children by
[5:26] Christ by Jesus Christ to himself
[5:29] according to the good pleasure of his
[5:32] will to the praise of the glory of His
[5:35] grace were in he hath made us accepted
[5:37] in the beloved okay let's go to Roman's
[5:50] 8:14 whereas minis are led by the Spirit
[5:54] of God they are the sons of God we have
[5:57] not received the spirit of bondage again
[5:59] to fear which you have received the
[6:01] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[6:04] Father the spirit itself beareth witness
[6:07] with our spirit that we are the children
[6:09] of God and if children then heirs heirs
[6:12] of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so
[6:16] be that we suffer with him that we may
[6:18] be also glorified together you may be
[6:21] seated
[6:22] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[6:25] the word and try to continue I thought
[6:29] what was it this morning we've been
[6:34] talking on the new birth that it is
[6:37] justification sanctification the baptism
[6:40] of the Holy Ghost
[6:41] makes the new birth okay alright and in
[6:45] doing that then all people who receive
[6:50] the new birth and we're not talking
[6:53] about the points of you know where you
[6:57] come in to your anointed ones or
[6:59] anything like that we're talking about
[7:00] the new birth all who received the new
[7:03] birth it's the same new birth there's
[7:06] not a new birth for this group of people
[7:08] and a new birth for that group of people
[7:10] it's the same new birth whoa you know a
[7:13] baby and the natural it's the same
[7:16] natural things of a birth happens you
[7:19] know no matter who it is so then all is
[7:23] the same it doesn't matter you say well
[7:24] we're not worth it no we're not any
[7:26] different it's always the same and each
[7:29] age had the new birth it was the Holy
[7:33] Ghost in each age to shine forth to the
[7:36] people of that age and to give a new
[7:38] birth all right so then all that
[7:41] received the new birth have to go
[7:43] through justification sanctification and
[7:46] the baptism with the Holy Ghost yeah but
[7:49] all I done was just didn't see your your
[7:51] own to what I was saying this morning
[7:54] the new birth is the new birth you
[7:57] crying shouting feelings emotions all of
[8:01] that goes with
[8:03] the new birth yes because you can't I
[8:06] don't believe in having a stillborn
[8:07] birth I believe in having emotional
[8:10] feelings with a new birth I believe in
[8:13] all of the expressions of shouting
[8:16] crying and seeing visions or hearing
[8:19] angels or whatever I believe I'll listen
[8:23] through your experience and I'll agree
[8:24] and believe it you know but then I just
[8:27] turn back and ask the same question that
[8:29] did and always have what is the new
[8:34] birth well it's not the shouting in the
[8:36] crime
[8:37] that's the after-effects that's the baby
[8:40] after it gets here it's going to cry but
[8:44] you know what I found with the babies
[8:45] there to show you that they're all the
[8:47] same I've never I've never noticed any
[8:50] of these babies back here that were from
[8:53] different countries
[8:55] you know when they cry they all cry an
[8:57] American right I mean I can understand
[9:02] them can't you all right they all cry
[9:06] the same I've never heard a dog you know
[9:10] and I've been in foreign countries and
[9:11] things you know and then brother Brady
[9:13] that we gonna get at Oh peacock that was
[9:16] one peacock I wanted to eat for lunch or
[9:18] supper but that's all right but they all
[9:21] sound the same
[9:23] all right see it's growing up and what
[9:27] we're we're all set in the stages of
[9:30] things that determines a lot of things
[9:33] to us all right but still the new birth
[9:35] is the new birth and everybody has the
[9:38] same new birth you say you have a
[9:41] distant shouting no that's not to birth
[9:43] that's all I've tried to get you to see
[9:46] that's not the birth the birth is
[9:50] preceded to that that is the after a
[9:53] fact as that's trying to express this
[9:56] morning I say you know if you want to be
[9:59] prayed far for for sickness or salvation
[10:01] come down here we'll see it's settled
[10:04] when you get up when you get up and walk
[10:07] this way itself cause you doesn't made
[10:09] up your mind
[10:10] you doesn't set it in motion all I do is
[10:13] just pray for the Lord to do things and
[10:16] I like the way brother
[10:17] used to pray he had a unique way of
[10:19] praying for people and and he would pray
[10:22] this away
[10:23] he'd say Lord said now they're seeking
[10:26] the new birth and said now Lord would
[10:30] you give just a little tug on the heart
[10:33] to let them know you know that you have
[10:38] accepted them well I like that because
[10:41] that gives something and I believe in
[10:43] those believing all kind of signs and
[10:46] wonders I believe in all things of
[10:48] manifestation but put it in the order of
[10:51] the way that it is and then it won't
[10:54] follow and then now I'm serious now you
[10:58] study the prophets message you're gonna
[11:01] find a lot of things that you read that
[11:03] this sounds different from that right
[11:07] you'll read something this will sound
[11:09] that's right in the same book in just a
[11:11] minute it sounds like he's talking about
[11:13] something else but when it's finished it
[11:17] all ties together if we allow it to be
[11:20] tied together all right see then we come
[11:23] through giving the scriptures that we've
[11:25] been giving you know how that we have
[11:27] the earnest of our inheritance and the
[11:30] earnest means a part payment and we're
[11:34] all born again first Corinthians 3:1 and
[11:37] two we're all just babies in Christ he
[11:43] said oh no brother there I was blown
[11:45] away up here cuz I had a great knowledge
[11:46] I don't believe that I'm sorry I believe
[11:51] the new birth is a sign sure they're not
[11:54] a word that you have and I understand
[11:58] determines how much you operate in God
[12:01] how much as God can use you yes and
[12:05] things like that but the point of
[12:07] getting at the birth is the same well
[12:11] let's get the baby born then we worry
[12:14] about the other cause see we've got to
[12:15] go through adoption we've got to go
[12:19] through the stature of a perfect man we
[12:22] got to go through all of the growth
[12:23] development of Christianity that's never
[12:27] now he's saying have you come into
[12:29] message the
[12:30] you know yourself you never heard about
[12:32] adoption always sir we talk about
[12:35] adoption in the Baptist Church but we
[12:37] just talked about adoption we didn't
[12:39] know what it was but we didn't know we
[12:41] were adopted into the family I mean I've
[12:44] heard Baptist preachers preach on how
[12:46] you're adopted into the family you know
[12:49] we preached a few things but we didn't
[12:51] have the understanding of what it was to
[12:54] do the Prophet had to come and bring
[12:56] those things unto us all right let's see
[12:59] it we have to have milk to grow you give
[13:02] a baby milk you don't give it meat
[13:06] you give it milk and it grows by that
[13:10] milk that it's brought are the
[13:12] nutritions and things that's within it
[13:14] and all and you turn out then to start
[13:17] growing all right then as you grow you
[13:21] know it becomes a little more the
[13:24] difference in your life and some have a
[13:26] big appetite and some don't
[13:28] we've told you about Jocelyn y'all
[13:30] should be set and ironed you'll be
[13:32] trying to feed him you'd have a spoon in
[13:34] one hand and a bowl with this food in it
[13:37] well this is the way you had to feed him
[13:40] you had a pacifier over here and you'd
[13:43] go and stick it in his mouth or as quick
[13:45] as you pull that out of his mouth you
[13:47] pop that pacifier into his mouth cause
[13:49] if you didn't he's gonna start screaming
[13:50] and hollering cause he wanted to eat
[13:53] well I like to see a Christian either
[13:57] way it likes to eat you know enjoy it
[13:59] have a good time okay now we're getting
[14:02] down to the port we're all wind up to be
[14:04] babies in Christ because everybody is
[14:09] born to baby okay all right then we'll
[14:14] get to it as brother branham goes along
[14:16] in the adoption know series I had a few
[14:18] laying at home where he talks about how
[14:21] you know you say oh let's see what did
[14:25] they say that one you said when I was
[14:28] born again tonight yesterday and today
[14:30] I'm going to preach he said nonsense now
[14:35] that's his words he says nonsense it's
[14:39] because you don't do that
[14:40] he come right off the bar
[14:43] the barroom put him up to preach he said
[14:45] that's not correct they don't set out
[14:50] learn a little bit get a little settled
[14:53] in the gospel then turn them loose don't
[14:56] put a novice and I love that I love the
[14:59] way the Lord Jesus does there's not a
[15:01] one of the please one of the writers in
[15:03] the Bible that was not present in the
[15:09] upper room now you have maybe a little
[15:13] argument over some of the little minor
[15:17] things but still just remember what I'm
[15:19] getting at
[15:20] God don't use the novice to bring his
[15:23] word he used someone settled in the word
[15:26] to speak that word because he's going to
[15:30] how to answer for his own word and he
[15:33] loves to do it alright but now let's get
[15:35] to the point to pick up what we're
[15:37] talking about we're trying to repeat a
[15:41] little bit for the purpose of
[15:42] understanding all right because we're
[15:46] all babies and we all desire the sincere
[15:51] milk Paul said of the word that we may
[15:54] grow thereby it's all by the word you
[15:59] notice that everything that I read this
[16:01] morning at our Wednesday it'll say and
[16:04] the word and the word because the new
[16:08] birth is the birth of the word right all
[16:12] right now as I emphasized this morning
[16:15] on that see the new birth is the birth
[16:17] of the word and that three thousand
[16:19] outside they had to hear a message
[16:20] because you can't be born again without
[16:22] hearing well I didn't hear nobody but I
[16:27] hang my Bible well that's somebody you
[16:30] know that was written by somebody all
[16:36] right see then the point of all tried to
[16:38] get you to see is that baby
[16:42] it needs the correct food to grow you
[16:47] can give it to wrong food and then it'll
[16:50] it'll turn different but you give it to
[16:53] right food you want it to grow
[16:56] and you want it to mature in the correct
[16:58] children all right
[17:00] now in doing that then you use oh if
[17:05] you'll get the simplicity of what I'm
[17:07] trying to say I'm trying to say it over
[17:09] and over enough to where you hear it if
[17:13] the new birth is the birth of the word
[17:16] they didn't a statue of a perfect man is
[17:19] that hard to understand it's the birth
[17:23] of the word adoption where brother
[17:28] Branham says we'll read it in a little
[17:30] while he says you're born to son all
[17:36] right
[17:37] what said then you need adoption all
[17:40] right well there's any problem that's
[17:42] just we need more word all right
[17:45] see that's why I said this morning
[17:46] emphasize just a tad let's see all of
[17:50] the whole thing here regardless of what
[17:52] words you had in other words you started
[17:55] off with the Apostles in the book of
[17:58] Acts and part of that group that was
[18:02] there were originals and they had the
[18:07] adoption of that day they didn't have
[18:09] the full adoption but they had the
[18:12] adoption for that day in time honor and
[18:14] as they did they could teach others but
[18:20] it wasn't long until that way begins to
[18:23] die down
[18:24] it lasted till about somewhere into the
[18:26] fourth church age all right then Satan
[18:29] begin to take away and take away until
[18:33] when you come into the field church age
[18:35] you've got Martin Luther with the just
[18:37] shall live by faith
[18:37] just barely getting started but he got
[18:40] started that's what I'm warning you to
[18:43] see in a minute when I say it so I'll
[18:45] say it now listen what a wonderful thing
[18:47] it is know brother Colley seventy years
[18:54] old never lose everything
[18:56] talk to him slowly loudly it's been 75
[19:00] well you get her dirt old I am her
[19:04] brother Colley now it wouldn't matter
[19:08] I'm making an illustration
[19:10] it wouldn't matter what his dad done in
[19:13] life he could be a murderer he could be
[19:16] this that or the other but it'd still be
[19:18] his daddy and he wouldn't change his
[19:22] name
[19:24] he keeps the name Kali you know and he
[19:29] wouldn't be ashamed of his dad anyway
[19:31] he'd be ashamed about what his dad done
[19:33] yeah what do you still honor the fact
[19:38] that he had a father you know what
[19:41] because one day he was a son one day
[19:47] James Colley was a child
[19:49] Oh Kali come into the world of selling
[19:53] ever born-again believer now listen I'm
[19:57] making a statement it's gonna take me
[19:58] three or four months to Bree ever
[20:01] born-again believer if you're truly born
[20:06] again you're a son or daughter of God
[20:10] all right you know what that means
[20:17] we're heirs then we'll get to that in a
[20:21] minute in Romans we're heirs of God and
[20:24] joint heirs with Jesus Christ so
[20:26] whatever they have we have it a son of
[20:31] God came sin enough to be lost that's
[20:35] gonna take months and you can't send
[20:38] enough to be lost
[20:40] remote said that no he said everybody's
[20:42] always worried about this Saturday he
[20:43] said you can't send enough to be lost no
[20:48] gonna do you're not gonna do it God's
[20:50] gonna take you off the same right now
[20:56] every child is born the child of God if
[21:03] you have a really new birth
[21:04] that makes you a son or daughter of God
[21:11] what a wonderful thing what a wonderful
[21:17] thing has happened to us in the human
[21:19] race that God has given
[21:23] his life he died for the purpose to
[21:28] release that life that you and I could
[21:31] become his children what a wonderful
[21:34] opportunity and to realize if you are
[21:38] truly born again you can never be lost
[21:43] you said you meaning I can this go out
[21:45] live like the devil that means you never
[21:47] was born because you don't want to do
[21:49] that brother Kali didn't run all over
[21:53] the country claiming to be a Jones he
[21:56] goes into the military you know what's
[21:58] your name Jones who we have here name is
[22:01] Kali well that was my life and yet
[22:06] illegally had a change so it wouldn't
[22:07] work well listen you get what I'm saying
[22:10] what a wonderful opportunity it is to be
[22:14] a child of God
[22:18] so how God is your father how great of
[22:24] an opportunity what would you want any
[22:26] greater I mean faith came to me right

[26:47] gonna happen thank God for the happening
[26:50] I don't care just called it happened I
[26:54] love it
[26:55] I love the fact you're thinking about
[26:57] being a Christian and you realize the
[27:00] entire Bible huh I didn't mean to
[27:01] pretenses okay you realize the entire
[27:04] Bible is yours
[27:09] you don't think sometimes about well you
[27:13] know what I have within me the Spirit of
[27:17] God that I can see movies are read about
[27:23] these great things of David and things
[27:26] like that those mighty men you realize
[27:30] the new birth that you have is the same
[27:34] God inside of you that they had outside
[27:37] of them because they were not capable of
[27:40] having him inside you not come yet Oh
[27:44] wonderful no wonder no wonder a little
[27:53] small button
[27:54] you remember that brother branham said
[27:58] just a Christian to be a Christian and
[28:02] it's like in your heart because it which
[28:05] is the soul he said when God comes in
[28:08] gives you an uber he said it's not just
[28:11] a little button
[28:12] no I'm foot no no listen to what he's
[28:16] saying see the growth development of a
[28:20] Christian watch what I'm saying on the
[28:22] way I said these virtues now listen to
[28:25] the point listen these virtues are in
[28:30] the soul but they are made manifest out
[28:35] through your spirit but they're a part
[28:40] of you and your soul the growing is in
[28:44] your soul not in your body and spirit I
[28:51] can't be explained the natural because
[28:53] it's growing all over right but listen a
[28:56] little white button he said let me refer
[29:01] to it like that and said it just starts
[29:06] growing and growing and says as it does
[29:11] you remember how we read he said it's
[29:14] pushing out all of those things that are
[29:20] not needful well I thought I was pure
[29:23] and clean I thought the Holy Ghost burn
[29:24] it does but that's till you come home
[29:29] let's don't make it so big of a movie
[29:32] that where was it's all gone Oh bless
[29:34] God if things go no if the devil is
[29:39] trying to come back do you believe that
[29:43] that he's always tempting you and
[29:47] drawing your way and doing it he's
[29:49] trying to come back and live in well you
[29:51] know what if it wasn't for God sealing
[29:55] that so he would come back though thank
[30:02] God that he sealed it but what is it
[30:04] watch the soul of man I was reading this
[30:06] morning with Brenham he said what is
[30:08] this oh he's
[30:08] you you they will look at it like some
[30:15] little square compartment inside of the
[30:18] heart well that's alright but just
[30:19] remember it's not in the heart anyway
[30:21] cuz the heart ain't nothing but a
[30:23] stuffing gizzard the heart of man is is
[30:27] the soul of man
[30:28] it's just mankind trying to express it
[30:31] what's alright put a little button nice
[30:37] eternal life well see here's we go well
[30:40] does that mean the rest of you is not
[30:43] eternal know that around said is God in
[30:49] you together as persons and they ain't
[30:55] no two persons of God so as God and you
[31:00] you remember how we tried to explain
[31:02] coming out to the the baptism of the
[31:05] Holy Ghost and how it burns out
[31:06] everything that's left within us that's
[31:08] right and God comes and lives but when
[31:11] he comes and lives he just comes into
[31:13] that little button he don't fill
[31:17] everything up and throw you away that's
[31:22] you and that little button is put in
[31:27] there is God but Aaron says eternal life
[31:30] as a little button oh man I could talk
[31:36] about eternal life if since it's your
[31:39] knee huh clear of a manifestation to
[31:44] understand what is happening within us
[31:48] see just get away from that fancy Park
[31:53] you know get away from the movie get
[31:56] down to where you live you know we're
[32:01] trying to make a movie out of your life
[32:02] I remember Zachary wait sit down stars
[32:12] named a certain actor and said he
[32:14] probably died when the hell was a curry
[32:16] didn't like that cuz he liked that
[32:19] feller
[32:20] you heat it like for a way to say
[32:22] there's possible for him to go to hell
[32:24] let's see that's just the way things are
[32:28] well let's don't try to make a movie
[32:30] let's try to be alive and be what we are
[32:32] and just think about it and just see
[32:37] what we really are the two very very
[32:42] fact that that sold is you the soul is
[32:46] not just a listen it's not just an inch
[32:50] square compartment that's his
[32:52] illustration the soul is you all right
[32:58] the body is you the spirit is you and
[33:02] without it those three you're not you
[33:06] it's just the difference of where God
[33:08] dwells he dwells in this human soul
[33:14] works back out through that through your
[33:17] spirit back into your body the people
[33:20] see your body reacting but they only see
[33:23] your body reacting and no it's what's
[33:25] taking place in your spirit but they
[33:28] don't think about that's real you what
[33:32] is the true desire of a Christian you
[33:36] want to be a Christian you want to live
[33:38] for God not to live for mankind but to
[33:43] live for God see if it wasn't for those
[33:48] things I just walk off this pulpit and
[33:50] say my life is based on one thing to try
[33:57] my best to get you to see the truth of
[34:00] the gospel if I offend you for doing
[34:03] that I don't mean to I don't mean to
[34:06] hurt nobody but I mean to tell it like
[34:08] it is where we have an opportunity to be
[34:12] able to serve God and walk in the light
[34:17] at we live in when he said a little
[34:19] button in inside of you well that's this
[34:25] you know that's an expression to me it
[34:30] just means I could say it this way
[34:32] inside of your soul
[34:34] when you're born again I will get back
[34:36] to this when it comes into the basis of
[34:39] the word faith the new birth faith then
[34:47] you've got to grow in grace and
[34:49] knowledge but you start by a little
[34:54] point of God coming to live inside of
[34:58] you and then he begins to work on you on
[35:02] the inside he doesn't work on your body
[35:07] he doesn't work on your spirit he works
[35:10] in the soul back out through your spirit
[35:13] and into the body make it in the correct
[35:16] order then you can see your desires
[35:21] you know God honors your desires he'll
[35:28] give you your desires even if sometimes
[35:31] it it may be wrong that we won't he will
[35:36] give us those things give honor our
[35:41] point of wanting something what you see
[35:48] that little button starts growing look
[35:52] at the statue of a perfect man their
[35:53] faith is that little button and this
[35:59] starts growing growing and growing and
[36:03] as it grows it pushes out it just keeps
[36:07] pushing out I don't understand how a cow
[36:13] eats green rice you swap me out I don't
[36:19] understand that but it does it in that
[36:23] body some way it transfers that and
[36:25] makes it work
[36:27] Oh wonderful now think of what I'm
[36:29] trying to say God I'm trying to get to
[36:31] that point of coming down just a little
[36:33] to where we can take a little point and
[36:36] then wait okay now listen you're when
[36:41] you have eternal life your soul it just
[36:46] is eternal
[36:48] as it will ever be you don't get eternal
[36:53] I didn't get eternal I'll get any time
[36:54] no see that's when two people to message
[36:58] today oh yeah you got a little something
[37:00] down here but you got a lady we get up
[37:02] here
[37:03] no that's the finish of it but you know
[37:10] what it's the finish up what you've
[37:11] started at faith you think I say so much
[37:16] about the new birth that's where it
[37:18] starts at it starts at that new birth
[37:23] and it begins to grow just as a natural
[37:27] baby eats to grow a spiritual baby eats
[37:31] the Word of God to grow you say well
[37:40] brother Dale I just can't remember like
[37:42] you if I was asked right now if I was
[37:49] asked to you to stand up and me to call
[37:51] out your name I couldn't do it you said
[38:00] boy I'm just honest Tom I got two or
[38:04] three names out I'd forget to rest
[38:07] boy you're stupid no I'm dumb
[38:10] tip it's another word I can't remember
[38:14] like that I don't try to remember like
[38:17] that I don't try to remember the Bible
[38:20] like that I told you the other day
[38:21] you've done you've done it this morning
[38:23] you're quoting the Lord's Prayer
[38:25] if you ask me to quote it I would
[38:27] probably miss it I'm quoting it well you
[38:32] sure no no no I don't know nothing
[38:34] the one the part of the word I need to
[38:37] know I know always reach over anything
[38:40] get it and it'll come out right because
[38:46] it's what I'd well on I don't dwell on
[38:49] memorizing the Bible
[38:50] I dwell on trying to understand what it
[38:57] means to me that's why there's like I
[38:59] said what is the new birth when
[39:01] prophet said it's the revelation of
[39:03] Jesus Christ personally to you I never
[39:05] had no doubt in my mind that I had to
[39:09] get some revelation of John 3:16 and all
[39:13] to be that sure that's involved in the
[39:15] human life but it is not the birth
[39:19] that's why I tried to explain it this
[39:23] morning that three thousand they heard a
[39:25] message about the Lord Jesus Christ and
[39:29] that he had died for them to give his
[39:31] life and they believed that was the
[39:34] birth when they believe that when they
[39:39] seen what he was saying and accepted
[39:42] that there's the birth if it was
[39:47] anything else it was my culture yeah
[39:48] they were in the upper rooms in one mind
[39:51] and one Accord then the Holy Ghost fell
[40:01] they searched we're just not looking at
[40:03] the Scriptures in the way that we need
[40:06] to look at them instead of looking to
[40:07] try to figure them out let's look at him
[40:10] to read and see what it says when Paul
[40:14] says your newborn baby little rock that
[40:18] I'm not no baby that sounds like a baby
[40:23] it sounded like one talking but when it
[40:30] comes to listening to the prophet why
[40:32] did the Prophet have to come we already
[40:37] had the Bible we already had the
[40:40] teachings of the scripture we already
[40:42] had the things that was talking about
[40:45] this your newborn babes desire the
[40:47] sincere milk of the word I've heard
[40:49] sermons over that in the Baptist jerks
[40:52] good preachers preach good messages
[40:56] there's one in the scripture in old
[40:58] Aachen that's worth talking about the
[41:00] whole armor of God put on the whole
[41:02] armor of God I don't like to hear that
[41:05] preach to him because every brand new
[41:07] preacher had ever gotten the Pope here
[41:08] in the Baptist Church he preached on
[41:11] that that was his first message
[41:14] the armor of God new to this but this on
[41:17] put that home for their own you know and
[41:19] he never saw one said or no no one word
[41:21] about this being the armor of God it was
[41:29] just an armor you put on this you're
[41:30] done and he's s to do that and I still
[41:33] had a good way to deliver it and others
[41:35] had okay I didn't get along back there
[41:40] so that's alright no I asked the Baptist
[41:44] preacher one day I said how come are you
[41:46] teaching us they were born again when we
[41:49] believe when we didn't teach that I said
[41:51] wait a minute
[41:52] hey I've been with you a long time now
[41:57] you do teach it that away you teach
[42:00] those things that's just believe I said
[42:04] you won't even read the scripture they
[42:06] said he that believeth and is baptized
[42:09] shall be saved I said your intellectual
[42:11] enough to know believe it means
[42:13] continual there's not just to believe
[42:16] something he said well I guess we did
[42:19] teach it wrong the listen Church we have
[42:28] in the new birth it makes us the
[42:34] children of God sons and daughters and I
[42:37] admit this much why does that you argue
[42:39] with God it doesn't say in the Bible
[42:42] that you have manifested sons and
[42:44] daughters so you know how that could go
[42:47] would I had a question about kind of a
[42:51] little bit knowing something I said that
[42:52] you know about things and I'll get
[42:54] nothing message but it doesn't say women
[42:59] and men it will always say sons of God
[43:02] are led by the Spirit of God but does
[43:07] that mean that just women are not led by
[43:09] I've defended that all along and you
[43:12] know what I've argued that point just
[43:14] because it don't say daughters doesn't
[43:17] mean they're not daughters you women are
[43:22] born-again Christian you are children in
[43:25] the body of Christ
[43:28] to change to be a son it's me a daughter
[43:33] we have two sons and a family and one
[43:37] daughter let's just put it for what it
[43:39] is two sons one daughter you'll have to
[43:42] change something the right of
[43:46] inheritance go just as well to the
[43:47] daughter as it goes to the Sun but in my
[43:50] poll and you said what do you tell me
[43:52] I'm talking about one thing let's don't
[43:55] decrease utilize ourselves but don't
[43:58] blow it away because we don't have an
[44:00] understanding a born-again Christian
[44:04] whether you be male or female is a part
[44:07] of the body of Jesus Christ in the new
[44:11] birth with eternal life just as eternal
[44:15] as the man is eternal right because
[44:23] that's the scripture that's where it all
[44:25] fits then that doesn't degrade it's just
[44:29] a fact of the way the Bible is written I
[44:32] was reading this morning against early
[44:34] yesterday last night where brother
[44:36] Branham was talking about you know your
[44:39] raw things are set in the Bible in a
[44:45] certain way but it doesn't as I said
[44:50] mean the way we read it it doesn't mean
[44:54] there's only sons in the manifestation
[44:57] of God just because it doesn't say
[45:02] daughters it's not saying that we make
[45:08] those things to be able to those points
[45:11] for our own little benefit you know the
[45:17] truth is the truth okay one but listen
[45:21] when a child was born into the family in
[45:24] the Old Testament and you know the story
[45:26] will quote just a little bit of it will
[45:28] quit but in the Old Testament you had
[45:31] what was called the adoption and that
[45:37] adoption was to the basis that no
[45:42] you'd have a child it would be given a
[45:46] tutor and that tutor would raise that
[45:49] child to the base is that it could come
[45:52] to a point that adoption could come into
[45:56] view there's that big a word wait
[46:00] license if I can farm this whenever I
[46:02] even answer bar whatever it is okay this
[46:09] is signet or a sign or a time that
[46:13] you've reached supposed to be the onion
[46:15] adulthood all right
[46:17] and I admit that they didn't have
[46:21] adoption for the doubters but were they
[46:26] left out of it
[46:27] no they stayed in the house they did
[46:32] shows that the daughter had to have a
[46:34] head so she stays in her home until she
[46:37] marries and when she marries her husband
[46:40] comes her head that's all it's so and
[46:43] it's just things in there that you know
[46:46] we need to get away from those I said
[46:49] movie versions and get out into the
[46:51] truth all right and thinking about it a
[46:56] child I mean are you gonna take that
[47:03] child and it's gonna raise up and then
[47:06] you get up in life and after a while you
[47:07] decide you don't want the child no more
[47:09] so either disinherited or or throw it
[47:11] out or whatever then you say I'll just
[47:13] cut you off no it's the child those back
[47:20] back there they had to have cygnets and
[47:23] signs you got two example of it I said
[47:25] example code is not totally true we've
[47:28] got the example of Jacob where he got
[47:30] the coat of many colors from his father
[47:32] you know you can use that as the
[47:33] examples of adoption really brother
[47:37] branham is the only one that I ever
[47:39] knowed of cuz I don't remember it when
[47:41] it was coming down of anybody talking
[47:44] about the Old Testament with the word
[47:46] adoption I thought it was a New
[47:48] Testament word brother Ron said it came
[47:51] through from the Old Testament all right
[47:55] and he said that child born in the
[47:57] family he said it's a child the day
[47:59] that's born it's a child he's full
[48:01] inherit and listen full inheritance as a
[48:04] child
[48:07] pulling hurt this is a child you can't
[48:10] take away from them that ride of being a
[48:13] member of that family cause he's born
[48:18] into that family
[48:19] now the inheritance coming on up is the
[48:24] growth development yes the Lord Jesus
[48:27] Christ but a random tells you over and
[48:31] over be glad to give them then one that
[48:33] God had opted his own child because
[48:39] remember one thing in the natural you
[48:43] got it stages of development like within
[48:45] the spiritual God don't adopt the devil
[48:48] of children
[48:49] you ain't gonna adopt to you if you
[48:51] ain't born again you're gonna get born
[48:54] again first are you ain't gonna be in
[48:56] line to be adopted so if you ever want
[48:59] to think about adoption worry about
[49:01] getting born again make sure that that's
[49:04] settled and right then you can think
[49:06] about inheritance cuz he brother branham
[49:10] will say he said you're born again he
[49:12] said that don't give you no inheritance
[49:17] he's not saying that you don't have the
[49:19] inheritance of being in the family he's
[49:25] not saying the child from the time it's
[49:26] born up to the word that it's coming to
[49:29] that position that it's not a child no
[49:31] it is a child and it's a full
[49:35] inheritance as a child but it's not
[49:39] inheritance as an adopted child it's a
[49:43] different thing to come into being and
[49:47] see we denomination you remember we
[49:49] never talked about adoptions and times
[49:54] they said I new messages heard of read
[49:57] description I could read where Paul said
[49:59] were adopted I'm new in the Baptist
[50:04] Church about the adoption to the point
[50:06] of the in grass day
[50:12] the wild olive tree being engrafted I
[50:16] was scratched sure you don't go out here
[50:23] then graph Oh
[50:26] bad apple tree into a good apple tree
[50:29] and expect to get a good apples you
[50:31] gonna get bad apples you take the good
[50:36] Apple and engrafted it in to the roots
[50:39] of that tree to where they did can
[50:42] produce and bring forth but you know
[50:47] eventually it'll die away because it's
[50:49] natural somewhere it'll break down
[50:51] notice dis the story adoption is a story
[50:56] told of biblical terminologies of how
[51:01] that a child is born into the family and
[51:05] didn't child comes to adoption position
[51:12] now listen he gives us the tutor the
[51:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost is your tutor
[51:21] gives you the new birth
[51:22] that's your tutor it's it's like the man
[51:27] that has the child you don't give the
[51:29] the tutor to the child when it's brand
[51:31] new baby come on just get sensible your
[51:35] thinking when the child comes going up
[51:37] in age enough to be able to answer a
[51:40] little bit ain't got no age limit to
[51:43] determine I know you don't take a
[51:45] newborn baby and hand it over to the
[51:47] tutor now leave it with the momma be
[51:51] sensible then one day when that child
[51:53] grows up enough theirs will call it the
[51:56] age of accountability is whatever you
[51:57] gonna call then it can be given a tutor
[52:01] now I don't give the Holy Ghost to a
[52:03] baby of a natural baby you come to the
[52:08] age of accountability then you're
[52:11] concerned about that part then he can
[52:13] bring you into the family okay now
[52:16] listen you're a son when you're born
[52:19] when you're born again that makes you
[52:22] itch
[52:22] of God with eternal life just as eternal
[52:27] as you ever will be the adoption doesn't
[52:34] go into giving you eternal life it goes
[52:36] into giving you a thora T's and things
[52:42] brings you to a position the word of
[52:44] growth development can come into view
[52:47] all right
[52:49] but around says we call it adoption
[52:52] he said calling the Old Testament when
[52:54] that man had a child he said he gave him
[52:57] a tutor he brought him up to a place to
[53:00] where that he could be trusted then he
[53:02] adopted him into the family and said now
[53:04] your name is just as good as the father
[53:07] that was a natural story I know him
[53:14] carnal I'm sorry
[53:16] annoys their minds but I tried to Jacob
[53:22] had him any sons toyou never out of
[53:28] twelve sons check him okay we got a
[53:30] number way well now Reuben was the first
[53:37] well now if the story is correct
[53:39] Reuben when he reached the age that it
[53:42] could be done he was adopted into the
[53:44] family coming all the way down finally
[53:51] you get to Jacob come in forth with a
[53:55] brain although sure you get to Joseph
[53:57] and Joseph gets a coat of many colors
[54:03] it's a show did his father loved him
[54:07] they showed he'd come to a position that
[54:12] he loved him he was the son of his old
[54:15] age he only had one natural
[54:18] brother-in-law Joseph and Benjamin see
[54:24] we look at something we think well this
[54:26] is the story the story has to be broken
[54:28] down the Ruby
[54:34] and all of those brothers they got
[54:36] adopted into their family the year comes
[54:42] a special one which the hostess because
[54:45] he loved him he was a child of his old
[54:48] age and I said the honored him or he
[54:52] made him a coat of many colors we can
[54:55] use that as adoption but all the others
[54:57] were adopted too you said what do you
[55:05] get I'm getting to one thing we take the
[55:08] natural story we can't use the natural
[55:10] story as a natural thing we have to
[55:13] bring it up into a spiritual
[55:16] understanding and then you say hey
[55:21] Joseph he got the coat of many colors he
[55:24] was adopted but don't mean it the rest
[55:27] of them wouldn't adopt it because they
[55:30] were the natural children of Jacob and
[55:32] that out of a right come on you call it
[55:41] adoption but just remember when you get
[55:48] born again you are a child of God that's
[55:54] why we're reading Romans let's read that
[55:56] I didn't necessarily give him that's a
[55:59] week if they can get to Romans 8 we need
[56:01] to pick that up I didn't give it back to
[56:04] him that order I didn't know what you
[56:05] way to go if you get to Roman's 8:14 or
[56:13] as many as are led by the Spirit of God
[56:16] they are the sons of God okay now listen
[56:23] to your scripture for as many as are led
[56:25] by the Spirit of God they are the sons
[56:27] of God if you're born again you're led
[56:30] by the Spirit of God that's what makes
[56:33] you a son of God right then what for you
[56:38] have not received the spirit of bondage
[56:39] in there to fear but you have received
[56:42] this the spirit of adoption
[56:48] in other words you're born to baby
[56:52] that's not your full stage of adoption
[56:55] that's the the earnest of your
[56:57] inheritance the spirit itself beareth
[57:00] witness with our spirit that we are the
[57:01] children of God listen and it's children
[57:03] then heirs look what the new birth gives
[57:07] you to be a child of God look what it
[57:12] gives you
[57:12] heirs of God which is eternal life Jesus
[57:18] never come to give us eternal life he
[57:21] come to bring us to eternal life eternal
[57:24] life is with the father Jesus had to
[57:29] give his life to release that for it to
[57:31] come back yes the Brethren said he said
[57:35] Jesus never never gave you an
[57:37] inheritance the father is what it gives
[57:42] you the inheritance they get the story
[57:45] correctly and the children then heirs
[57:47] heirs of God you mean we are yeah
[57:55] because when our children were born into
[57:58] our family
[57:59] and made them heirs your children is
[58:04] born into your family their heirs if you
[58:08] think this thing ain't right you go to
[58:10] an adoption agency and find out what
[58:12] adoption me you're gonna learn a lot
[58:14] more than you think I'll try to tell you
[58:20] about the dots into the vases you know
[58:22] an enriched 'red could ain't gonna do it
[58:24] and then work they could deny and of
[58:26] course he's their daughter and sent her
[58:28] out but they can never deny Thomas Abbey
[58:35] okay every grace is a natural born child
[58:41] Thomas as an adopted child has more
[58:45] rights legally by the law there's a
[58:50] natural born child that's how much God
[58:52] thinks about adoption it's brought into
[58:55] our government
[59:00] you know the adoption was really if you
[59:02] chase it well back and I knew this in
[59:04] the Baptist er the adoption was really
[59:06] back in the Romans days it was inherited
[59:09] over into the religious side of Israel
[59:13] coming from the natural world they
[59:18] picked it up from the natural world the
[59:20] people that were around them it was not
[59:22] a biblical handwritten you go to do this
[59:25] you go do that
[59:25] you adopt that's why you don't find the
[59:27] word adopts in the Old Testament I'm
[59:32] saying this I'm just I don't I don't
[59:34] remember the word adoption ever being
[59:35] held as I don't know what I'm gonna
[59:38] stand corrected now but I'm just saying
[59:39] I know it's not much but it's not an old
[59:41] Old Testament word because it can't be
[59:46] understood because how would you explain
[59:49] Jacob with 12 children and the only
[59:54] having the adoption of one child
[59:58] no we get adoption with each one see
[1:00:01] that's what I'm saying go to the go to
[1:00:03] it in stay with what God has given to
[1:00:05] you and me the opportunity for you and I
[1:00:08] to understand where we're leaving in
[1:00:12] what's going on if children and heirs
[1:00:15] heirs of God then what and joint heirs
[1:00:19] with Christ now if that's correct the
[1:00:26] new birth makes you a child of God just
[1:00:32] like Jesus was a child of God in her -
[1:00:38] all things equal in all thing that's
[1:00:46] something I miss how much happy should
[1:00:49] we be come look he explains it and
[1:00:53] joiners were trying yeah he explains it
[1:00:56] to make sure you don't misunderstand if
[1:00:59] so be that we suffer with him in other
[1:01:02] words if we get within us this the soul
[1:01:09] of Almighty God in the form of the
[1:01:12] baptism of the whole
[1:01:13] those were just as much Joan ours as
[1:01:15] Christ and that's why it said if so be
[1:01:18] that we suffer with him
[1:01:21] it means if if you are a child of God
[1:01:24] you're a joint heir but you've already
[1:01:27] got this part up here heirs heirs of God
[1:01:32] he turn allows you remember wage keeps
[1:01:37] praying that out in the sealed book kind
[1:01:38] of word that Jesus inherited something
[1:01:43] by coming into the world you know that
[1:01:45] the flesh the body the flesh of the Lord
[1:01:49] Jesus Christ was not eternal it had to
[1:01:53] be made eternal and by the in made
[1:01:55] eternal he an inherited he inherited
[1:02:01] eternal life in the body that's the only
[1:02:05] way the you and I will ever come to the
[1:02:09] position of a change of these bodies as
[1:02:13] to be heirs with Jesus Christ he never
[1:02:20] died to give us an inherited he died to
[1:02:22] bring us to it our inheritance is
[1:02:24] eternal life with God before the
[1:02:26] foundation in the world they Church what
[1:02:33] a wonderful thing it has to be the
[1:02:34] children of God but what a wonderful
[1:02:37] thing it is to understand it that'll
[1:02:41] never come to change the Bible he didn't
[1:02:46] change any I would say this is wrong
[1:02:48] here we need to put this here that
[1:02:49] slowly he made a few Corrections but
[1:02:55] those Corrections were were wrong just a
[1:02:57] point of interest as a point when he
[1:03:00] would say this should have been the lie
[1:03:01] instead of a lie
[1:03:04] that's just the point that they the
[1:03:08] interpreters miss that positive point
[1:03:11] that if she would have been as deal I
[1:03:14] instead of just a lie dirt
[1:03:22] listen to be the children of God
[1:03:24] that's what I'm telling you okay that's
[1:03:29] what I was trying to bring out what I've
[1:03:32] tried to bring out device few messages
[1:03:34] that I wonderful thank God would come
[1:03:43] down and give his life to where he could
[1:03:48] relinquish you know release the life
[1:03:51] that was within him then it could come
[1:03:54] back into you and I without that we
[1:03:59] can't be the children of God they were
[1:04:02] adopted in right come we were not
[1:04:07] natural born the Jew then listen we'll
[1:04:11] get back to it if we don't listen the
[1:04:13] adoption
[1:04:14] Paul said pertained to Israel see they
[1:04:22] were the children of God and the
[1:04:25] adoption arrived returns to Israel but
[1:04:29] they rejected that right they done is
[1:04:32] who was it which won him back her he saw
[1:04:35] sold his birthright
[1:04:37] that's what Israel done they sold their
[1:04:40] birthright their birthright was the
[1:04:42] adoption now listen it even says unto
[1:04:45] them belong the Oracles which is
[1:04:47] Oracle's is is the Word of God the Bible
[1:04:50] that's the Oracles of God
[1:04:53] that's what it means when it said
[1:04:55] Oracle's that's this is the Oracles of
[1:04:57] God it's garden in letter form and see
[1:05:02] it belongs to Israel but they turned it
[1:05:05] down and got turning it down as Jacob
[1:05:09] did back there I mean as Esau did he saw
[1:05:13] could never even though he sought it
[1:05:15] with tears he could never get that
[1:05:19] birthright back then you call o Jacob he
[1:05:24] was a shyster well I am too when it
[1:05:28] comes to this gospel I'm a shyster you
[1:05:30] know what I'm fixing to say most of you
[1:05:32] we used to go to Jeffersonville
[1:05:35] learn to 68 long right in there and we
[1:05:38] go up higher and they'd have they print
[1:05:41] a book for each meeting
[1:05:42] well they print 500 books they'd be a
[1:05:45] thousand people I've stood in line at
[1:05:50] the Tabernacle for four hours while the
[1:05:53] family went to get us a motel got us
[1:05:55] something to eat and come back and I eat
[1:05:57] standing in line waiting to get in and
[1:05:59] that's after the prophets done go home
[1:06:01] cuz I wanted to ride to get done but
[1:06:04] also wanted something else you remember
[1:06:08] me telling you they started to front
[1:06:11] with them books they have them boxes and
[1:06:13] they'd hand them out in the Deacons with
[1:06:15] pipes of mountain people and they price
[1:06:17] of it like here there's five people they
[1:06:19] give five books and they would place
[1:06:21] them down the house I would just go down
[1:06:24] through there like I was looking for a
[1:06:26] Pew you know or seat they're going along
[1:06:29] you know and I'd be doing it no brother
[1:06:32] Carly he'd reach down you know who one
[1:06:34] of the big reach down and get a pack of
[1:06:36] books and hand over to somebody else
[1:06:38] when he did I just say thank you you
[1:06:40] know we just walk right back up to the
[1:06:42] front like I was gonna pie somehow reach
[1:06:44] out I'm gonna walk to the back and and I
[1:06:46] was gonna pass them out to the ones that
[1:06:48] went with us we never went to a service
[1:06:51] that we didn't get a book that I was
[1:06:53] there I'm a shyster I'll do anything to
[1:06:58] get the gospel could I know what it
[1:07:00] means I'm enjoying it but what will it
[1:07:06] be when we get over yonder enjoying the
[1:07:11] throne before the glasses see what it'd
[1:07:13] be like to be the children of God if
[1:07:21] you're a child of God you have eternal
[1:07:22] life a confession is not a possession
[1:07:27] with a real possession of a born-again
[1:07:29] believer that soul is just as eternal as
[1:07:32] it'll ever be and it's just as eternal
[1:07:34] as got it caught it is God God joins
[1:07:37] into us making that soul that we are
[1:07:40] eternal adoption goes on into then as
[1:07:47] the children
[1:07:48] becoming air in add optional for the
[1:07:56] brother branham we'll get to it with the
[1:07:58] Lord Jesus on the River Jordan it says
[1:08:01] this is my beloved son and then one
[1:08:05] police tutorial typing the new birth to
[1:08:11] you and I went over at about the 17th
[1:08:14] chapter words in Matthew where it comes
[1:08:16] over to where it says he appeared you
[1:08:18] know angels and I thought he said this
[1:08:21] is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased as
[1:08:24] well
[1:08:24] your ye him he had reached his adoption
[1:08:34] he had been adopted into the family
[1:08:39] that's what it means to you and uh he
[1:08:42] went on the Calvary and his body was
[1:08:44] changed as I said he inherited by giving
[1:08:49] his life he inherited eternal life in
[1:08:52] the body
[1:08:53] he was eternal life in soul and spirit
[1:08:56] because he was God but his body was not
[1:08:59] eternal and had to be made eternal but
[1:09:04] when it did he inherited it and by an
[1:09:07] hurt and that body got me and you with
[1:09:09] it because remember he was standing down
[1:09:12] her on the River Jordan and he said this
[1:09:14] is my beloved son then one pleased to
[1:09:17] dwell
[1:09:18] he said now I've accepted him
[1:09:22] perforation and said he'll accept you
[1:09:27] right there on the River Jordan that was
[1:09:29] proved who he was he didn't become God
[1:09:32] on the River Jordan he was born God but
[1:09:36] he became then the ability to die and
[1:09:42] give me eternal life he became me I mean
[1:09:49] came to us that we might become him come
[1:09:52] on musician think on these times of what
[1:09:59] it means to be a child of God
[1:10:05] what a wonderful opportunity to be the
[1:10:08] children of Almighty God to be born in a
[1:10:16] family I've always told you if they come
[1:10:20] to me today I've been a Dale for 79
[1:10:25] years and that come to me today and Obie
[1:10:27] said use the Jones I said you're a real
[1:10:31] daddy here that's it forget it
[1:10:32] my real daddy was Sam Dale I don't want
[1:10:37] no Jones well yeah but if you'll be a
[1:10:39] Jones we'll give you me in the daughter
[1:10:41] that you know you heard me say this
[1:10:43] before and you think I'm lying but come
[1:10:45] on try it they'd offer me millions of
[1:10:49] dollars to accept the fact that my daddy
[1:10:52] sound there wouldn't my daddy house a
[1:10:54] Jones
[1:10:55] I don't want it cuz why because I know
[1:11:03] what a daylily is I've been a Dale I
[1:11:09] know what it is to be one I don't have
[1:11:12] to prop up and be a jones act like one
[1:11:16] I'm me all the way around
[1:11:18] I've always been that way I'm just me
[1:11:21] I'm sorry
[1:11:23] as a minister at all things I've failed
[1:11:26] and everything in the world trying to
[1:11:28] get you to see Jesus Christ that's all
[1:11:33] my goal that's my daddy
[1:11:35] I didn't get to know my real father he
[1:11:38] passed when I was about four have no
[1:11:40] remembrance of him but one day I found
[1:11:44] my real father and I not changed my name
[1:11:49] to get it so when we don't need to
[1:11:52] change my name now to get something else
[1:11:55] and just what I am a child of God being
[1:12:04] heirs with God with eternal life being
[1:12:10] joint heirs with Jesus Christ to make me
[1:12:13] a child of God just
[1:12:14] he was a child I mean through he never
[1:12:21] got around to preaching all nicely on
[1:12:22] the Godhead so hold on to it when he
[1:12:24] zags we'll start back over because you
[1:12:28] realize that man it was standing on
[1:12:32] earth he's my brother
[1:12:34] that man standing on earth was no God
[1:12:38] God came in that man to live that's why
[1:12:47] he's my Savior he's my brother that was
[1:12:49] the only way that life could be released
[1:12:51] that I could become a child was for him
[1:12:56] to do the Kinsmen part to give me his
[1:13:00] own life but he had inherited it first
[1:13:05] that's why we haven't had to change the
[1:13:07] body because I got two quotes I know
[1:13:10] laying on the - maybe one we've been
[1:13:12] around said what is that he said it will
[1:13:14] be at the first resurrection when his
[1:13:19] adoption completed at the first
[1:13:21] resurrection cause you and I've got to
[1:13:26] be a part of the first resurrection we
[1:13:28] don't go the second resurrection goes to
[1:13:32] a place is called a white throne
[1:13:35] judgment first resurrection there is no
[1:13:39] judgment so which one do you want to be
[1:13:42] you want to be a child by the first
[1:13:44] resurrection a born-again Christian
[1:13:47] didn't accept Jesus Christ as your
[1:13:49] Savior
[1:13:49] and let him come and live in you you
[1:13:51] know what I just don't understand I said
[1:13:53] Paul do you believe Jesus was Almighty
[1:13:57] God do you believe that he come and
[1:14:00] lived in this world and died for you and
[1:14:03] me didn't accept that and say thank you
[1:14:05] Lord for giving that to me you mean it's
[1:14:09] that simple yes because then he can do
[1:14:13] something about it
[1:14:14] now if you won't do it he keep doing
[1:14:16] about it you can't make you accept
[1:14:19] eternal life do you make it available
[1:14:28] and make it available the Lord Jesus is
[1:14:31] the only one that went through death
[1:14:35] burial resurrection eternity ascension
[1:14:40] and then returning back in the baptism
[1:14:45] of the Holy Ghost thinking all these
[1:14:48] things while we go go ahead let Stan
[1:14:55] Thank You long pause let me be here
[1:15:03] right hardly done to deserve it such
