[0:00] God bless you Saints it's good to be in
[0:02] the house of the Lord amen and we had a
[0:05] wonderful time
[0:07] yesterday and
[0:09] uh youth meetings are for The Young and
[0:12] the old one one day we're going to go to
[0:14] the a youth meeting in the air and we're
[0:16] it's going to be we we'll be young again
[0:20] see all these gray hairs and everything
[0:23] they'll all be gone I'll be taken care
[0:25] of Amen let's go to the Lord in prayer
[0:28] before we get into our study Lord we're
[0:29] so so thankful for your for your word
[0:31] thank you Lord for the that the
[0:33] prophet's message that we were just
[0:35] listening to to restore our hearts back
[0:37] to the original faith I pray God that
[0:39] you'll prepare our hearts this morning
[0:41] for the word that you have in store for
[0:43] us today we come expecting Lord Jesus we
[0:46] come expected to receive something help
[0:49] us Lord Jesus we pray in your name
[0:52] amen so we've been kind of meditating on
[0:55] what is what is that Jean seed um cuz
[0:58] that was the topic of the last
[0:59] Minister's meeting and just kind of Tak
[1:01] taking that and just wanted to meditate
[1:03] on it for a few Sundays and uh thinking
[1:07] about um that scripture in Romans
[1:09] chapter 9 verse 13 that says Jacob have
[1:13] I loved but Esau have I
[1:15] hated and uh which is Paul's quoting
[1:18] from Malachi chapter 1 that says I have
[1:21] loved you sayith the Lord yet ye say
[1:22] wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau
[1:24] Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I
[1:26] love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his
[1:29] mountains and his her is Wass for the
[1:30] dragons of the Wilderness and brother
[1:33] brandham would lay lay lay the framework
[1:35] for these things that that this is a an
[1:38] eternal thought that God we know the
[1:41] thoughts of God they're not changing
[1:43] like our thoughts that you know one day
[1:45] you can think of a different I think I I
[1:47] think I'll apply for a job over here I
[1:50] think that I need to do this one day but
[1:52] God's thoughts are permanent and
[1:55] unchanging and his thoughts of of of if
[1:59] if you've got eternal life today or you
[2:01] ever will have eternal life it's not
[2:04] even just a thought like a thought that
[2:06] we would have but it's an actual and
[2:08] attribute of God it's part of him and so
[2:12] he expresses that he expresses these
[2:15] attributes by the Spoken Word by
[2:17] speaking it out and so you think about
[2:20] that the spoken word uh that we're
[2:22] hearing is actually expressing the
[2:25] thought of that he had before the
[2:26] foundation of the world of you that that
[2:30] you would have eternal life and that you
[2:31] would be conformed to the image of the
[2:33] Son of God and that you would be
[2:35] conformed to maturity and so the word
[2:37] that we're hearing is actually bringing
[2:39] us back to the thought that God had and
[2:43] so you know we think of think about sit
[2:47] up on the mountain top and think about
[2:48] that sometime sit under the old Apple
[2:50] Tree amen sit open your Bible in the
[2:53] morning with your coffee or whatever and
[2:54] think that God knew you before the
[2:57] foundation of the world and it's not
[2:59] just something something that just
[3:00] popped into his mind no sir but he
[3:02] always knew that you would want it and
[3:05] he had in his in his mind uh just the
[3:07] same way that he knew that one day he
[3:09] would die on the cross the lamb slain
[3:11] before the foundation of the world and
[3:13] that same way that he knew that was
[3:15] going to happen he knew that you would
[3:16] want the word and you would respond to
[3:18] it and it was something that was it
[3:20] didn't pop into his head it was always
[3:23] there so much that it's actually a part
[3:26] of
[3:27] him now when we think about part of him
[3:30] we're talking about like you know your
[3:32] your your jeans are you know uh the
[3:34] jeans that you're expressing your hair
[3:35] color your your skin color your
[3:38] characteristics all of those things are
[3:40] part part of you and you're expressing
[3:42] those those genes as as you're born as a
[3:44] little baby in the natural and you keep
[3:46] growing up you you you express the
[3:48] characteristics of your mother and
[3:50] father so God is expressing you are
[3:54] actually an
[3:55] expression of a part of God as you hear
[3:59] the word you're actually
[4:00] expressing the thought that or the
[4:02] attribute the thing of God that he
[4:04] wanted to express in this world that's a
[4:07] that's a pretty big that's a pretty big
[4:09] thought to think about
[4:11] amen it's almost
[4:14] mindblowing in Isaiah 46 it says that's
[4:18] this is a wonderful quote to hang on to
[4:20] scripture remember the former things of
[4:22] old for I am God and there's none else
[4:24] I'm God and there's none like me
[4:26] declaring the end from the beginning now
[4:29] you think about the characteristic of
[4:30] God that he knows everything that's ever
[4:32] going to happen he's sitting outside of
[4:34] time and can observe the end from the
[4:36] beginning and from ancient times the
[4:38] things that are not yet done saying my
[4:40] counsel shall stand and I will do all my
[4:44] pleasure so so what that means that put
[4:47] yourself in there that he knows the day
[4:49] and the hour that you're living in he
[4:51] knew what uh what kind of a sermon to
[4:54] preach for you to kind of you feel that
[4:57] like brother R was just saying the Deep
[4:58] call into the deep amen yeah and and and
[5:01] and and for you to respond so improving
[5:04] his word he said his forn knowledge know
[5:07] what you would
[5:08] do so let's kind of examine that what
[5:11] that means is his forn knowledge allows
[5:14] him to understand people's characters
[5:16] their
[5:17] inclinations and their responses to
[5:20] Divine matters even before they are born
[5:23] so we're framing up like Jacob and Esau
[5:27] he knew Jacob would would rather have
[5:30] that uh the birthright than the bowl of
[5:32] M suit so forn knowledge includes
[5:34] knowing who will bear the character of
[5:36] Christ and who won't so maybe just step
[5:39] back look over the banister of time like
[5:41] God and and and and it's like him
[5:43] peering down through all of history and
[5:45] and all the different people all the
[5:47] different possibilities and he sees you
[5:50] and I know you're going to want it y so
[5:53] thereby knowing that looking at it by
[5:55] for knowledge then he can predestinate
[5:57] amen then he's going to have a an angel
[5:59] in the the seventh Church age then he's
[6:00] going to have a a Ministry he's going to
[6:02] have a church waiting for you all those
[6:03] kind of things he can he can organize
[6:05] I'm I'm going to put this person in this
[6:07] family I'm going to have this person
[6:09] maybe they don't know anything about the
[6:10] Lord so I'm going to have them marry
[6:12] this person and everything is arranged
[6:14] because he's looking at your
[6:16] character and and then it all works out
[6:19] like that by for knowledge he knowed
[6:21] what you would do by for knowledge he
[6:23] knew see now that he's looking at the
[6:25] characteristics of the
[6:27] individual now frame it up like this
[6:30] because he knew Jacob and he knew Esau
[6:32] he knew that you wherever you put Jacob
[6:35] he's always going to respond and I like
[6:39] like brother Brown said if if he uh if
[6:42] you want to know how you would respond
[6:43] in any other Church age look how you
[6:45] respond in this age how you responding
[6:47] right now because it's it's who you are
[6:50] so if you put Jacob in the days of
[6:53] Malachi or the days of Daniel or the
[6:56] days of Micah or whatever it's as who he
[6:58] is he's always going to respond
[7:00] amen my for line is he knew that Esau
[7:03] was a Shyer and he knew that Jacob would
[7:05] respect that birth
[7:07] right now it you ever stop to just
[7:10] Ponder these things like Esau what are
[7:13] you thinking you'd rather have a bowl of
[7:16] little soup yeah than the birthright
[7:19] right the birthright tying in to one day
[7:23] that you're going to bring forth the
[7:24] Messiah amen that that line one day that
[7:27] that that the Messiah is going to come
[7:29] forth and and restores back to all
[7:31] things and everything and he'd rather
[7:33] have that bowl of L soup and the moment
[7:35] it seemed good like God looking down
[7:38] from eternity knew that Esau would
[7:40] rather have that bowl of little soup so
[7:43] he he knew he knew how he was going to
[7:46] respond and what a strange thing too now
[7:49] just just Ponder on these things that
[7:51] Esau looked outwardly like the he he
[7:53] took care of his daddy he was like the
[7:56] better son the the good he was the good
[7:58] one yeah and Jacob was like a little
[8:01] mama's boy what what do you you know so
[8:04] many things that you would look at his
[8:06] life and like what it looks like Esau in
[8:09] the natural is is better but Jacob had
[8:12] so many faults in things but yet what
[8:15] God was looking at do you do you want it
[8:18] do you
[8:19] want do you want to be tied into the
[8:22] into the
[8:23] manifestation of the attribute of God
[8:26] Amen so so there's where jaob value was
[8:31] is he he was he was a he manifested the
[8:34] thought of God that God had about him
[8:36] before the foundation of the world so we
[8:39] got all these scriptures I know they're
[8:40] a little bit small but I'll just read
[8:41] through them in Romans 8 for whom he did
[8:43] for know he also did predestinate amen
[8:47] and there's there's that scripture that
[8:49] we preach that's your purpose if you
[8:50] want to know what your purpose is you
[8:52] were because you were forone you're
[8:54] predestinated to be conformed to the
[8:55] image of his
[8:56] son well I don't know what I'm doing
[8:58] here there's there's your
[9:00] scripture I don't know what I'm I don't
[9:02] know why I'm coming to church that's it
[9:04] right there Ephesians 1: 14:5 says
[9:07] according as Heath chosen us us in him
[9:09] before the foundation of the
[9:11] world but that we should be holy and
[9:13] Without Blame before him in love having
[9:15] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[9:17] children by Jesus Christ to himself so
[9:21] so he knew that you would want it and so
[9:24] therefore because his attributes are
[9:26] Eternal that you're part of him so
[9:28] therefore you're chosen in him because
[9:30] you're always you always were part of
[9:32] him so when he manifested himself on the
[9:35] earth and died then he those attributes
[9:38] that were always in him could be
[9:39] expressed now but before the foundation
[9:41] of the world you're already you're
[9:42] chosen in him you're part of him in 2
[9:45] Timothy 1:9 who ha saved us and called
[9:48] us with an holy calling not according to
[9:50] your works but according to his own
[9:51] purpose and Grace which was given us in
[9:54] Christ when before the world began
[9:59] in 2 Thessalonians 2:13 says but we are
[10:02] bound to give thanks always to God for
[10:04] you Brethren beloved of the Lord because
[10:07] God hath from the beginning chosen you
[10:10] to Salvation through sanctification of
[10:12] the spirit and belief of the truth so
[10:16] we're we're we're living out in time
[10:18] right now what God always knew would
[10:20] happen we're we're manifesting in time
[10:23] an eternal truth that that you always
[10:26] were Eternal because God always knew
[10:29] that you you want it it's it's not
[10:31] something that it's like going to slip
[10:32] away oh I better better be careful I'm
[10:35] going to lose this one no he said I'm
[10:37] not going to lose one Lord nobody
[10:39] nobody's going to slip out of his grasp
[10:42] it's a it's a constant thing that God
[10:44] now aren't you glad of that kind of
[10:46] assurance that if he thought of you he's
[10:48] not going to lose you that's why in John
[10:52] 6:37 we've got that promise that all
[10:54] that the father giveth me shall come to
[10:56] me and him that cometh to me I will in
[10:59] no wise cast
[11:00] out so uh these attributes of God it's
[11:04] you know they can be expressed in a book
[11:06] it's like and that's the Lamb's Book of
[11:08] Life a section of the book of life
[11:10] that's Eternal because it it's like a
[11:13] list a list of names and and if you want
[11:16] to find out if your name if your name is
[11:18] in the book then you look back to the
[11:20] book because the book is actually
[11:22] expressing those names that's why when
[11:24] we read these stories of Ruth and and
[11:27] and and Esther and we we start
[11:29] identifying ourself with the word that's
[11:33] how we recognize our we recognize that
[11:36] we're in the book not that not that your
[11:39] name is right like Jacob it it'd be nice
[11:41] if your name was listed out like Jacob
[11:43] Jacob Bob have I loved way have I loved
[11:47] something like that but it's not it's
[11:49] not expressed like that in the word but
[11:51] you can still identify yourself because
[11:53] you go through the same Journey you go
[11:55] through the same uh experiences you can
[11:58] identify yourself when when you read
[11:59] when you read about
[12:01] Daniel crying on his bed at night you
[12:04] read you read about Solomon you read
[12:06] about all these story they're expressing
[12:08] attributes and characteristics that you
[12:10] can identify with and you you've been
[12:13] through the same thing when you read
[12:15] about on the day of Pentecost and the
[12:17] journey of the Believers in Acts and
[12:19] signs and one's follow wonders following
[12:21] you begin to identify yourself with that
[12:23] amen and it's it's it's God actually
[12:25] showing you and revealing to you that
[12:27] because as you hear the word and you're
[12:29] you become the word expressed and you
[12:31] identify yourself back with the word he
[12:33] show he's he's revealing to you that
[12:35] you're part of
[12:36] it in 2 Timothy 1:9 who has saved us and
[12:40] called us with an holy calling not
[12:41] according to our works but according to
[12:44] his own purpose and Grace which was
[12:45] given in Christ before the world
[12:48] began so so God's thoughts are not just
[12:51] abstract or fleeting ideas but rather
[12:54] the very Foundation of all reality
[12:58] that's God's thoughts are the starting
[13:00] point of everything in
[13:03] existence he thought it then he spoke it
[13:06] the sun came into the existence he
[13:08] thought it and he spoke it and this the
[13:10] galaxies were spun off and he thought it
[13:13] and he spoke it and now and there's a
[13:16] quote he thought it he spoke it and now
[13:18] here you
[13:19] are he thought it and he spoke it and
[13:21] here you are so the we're coming in
[13:24] church is not just in vain but it we're
[13:27] actually as you hear the word is
[13:30] actually something Supernatural is
[13:32] taking place that Eternal thought that
[13:34] God had about you from before the
[13:36] foundation of the world is now
[13:38] expressing in you right now so so then
[13:41] we can identify ourselves that the life
[13:43] the supernatural life that we're living
[13:45] right now is that thought that God had
[13:48] before the foundation of the world
[13:49] that's and that positionally places us
[13:52] and that gives us identity and when you
[13:54] can start identifying yourself with the
[13:56] word and that gives you confidence you
[13:58] don't you don't have you don't have
[14:00] anything to prove anymore you you know
[14:02] maybe maybe early on in your spiritual
[14:04] journey you you had a lot to prove I I
[14:06] want to prove that I'm born again I want
[14:07] to prove that I'm called I want to prove
[14:09] this or that I want to prove I'm in the
[14:11] right church I want to prove this and
[14:12] that but when you begin to get placed
[14:14] you don't have nothing to prove anymore
[14:16] because it identifies you back and you
[14:18] can
[14:19] see I I I I know I know where I stand
[14:22] amen amen so so
[14:25] uh those who are part of God's Eternal
[14:28] plan those who have eternal life are not
[14:30] just mere thoughts but attributes of God
[14:32] they are reflections of God's Eternal
[14:35] nature and purpose brother R would say
[14:38] and sir we would we would see Jesus he
[14:40] said in the beginning God was not even
[14:42] God he was the great Eternal and in
[14:45] there was attributes attributes was his
[14:48] thoughts and then he become a word like
[14:51] this and a word expressed well a thought
[14:54] expressed is a word a word expressed is
[14:56] a thought and then remember if if you
[14:59] ever wasn't God's thinking you'll always
[15:01] be there amen if you've got eternal life
[15:05] you are the expression of the attribute
[15:07] of his thought for this age amen there's
[15:10] only one eternal life and it always
[15:12] existed and you and his mind existed
[15:15] before there was a world that's the
[15:17] reason he said he chose you before the
[15:19] foundation of the world it isn't what we
[15:21] think what somebody else thinks is what
[15:24] God Eternal you always was see in his
[15:27] thinking
[15:30] now now that's not that's not a quote
[15:32] that to fall asleep
[15:33] on that's a quote to get excited about
[15:36] that when I read something like that I
[15:38] that that makes me happy that's right
[15:39] amen amen yeah when you get down you you
[15:43] you start thinking about that in the
[15:44] shower in the morning or when you when
[15:47] you know every the world's ganging up on
[15:48] you God always had me on his
[15:52] mind and the identification of Christ in
[15:55] all ages he said man I break it down in
[15:57] the beginning was the eternal he wasn't
[15:59] even God God our English word is an
[16:01] object of worship but he there wasn't
[16:03] nothing to worship him he was just the
[16:05] Eternal in him was attributes anyone
[16:08] knows what an attribute is in other
[16:10] words in him was his thoughts just
[16:12] thoughts that's his attribute then is
[16:15] word and a thought expressed is a word
[16:17] in the beginning was the word before it
[16:19] was even expressed it was a thought
[16:22] attributes now see what he's trying to
[16:24] frame up in our minds is to get away
[16:26] from that thought that God has thoughts
[16:28] like we do yeah well I'm thinking about
[16:30] this I think it'd be a great idea to
[16:32] save brother Ryan I think it no it's not
[16:34] like that it's it's constant so much
[16:37] that his thoughts about of you those
[16:39] Eternal thoughts of the the eternal life
[16:41] that you're going to receive here in
[16:43] time are a constant they're part of him
[16:46] amen right and I keep reiterating that
[16:49] so that so that yeah I hope we'll we'll
[16:51] kind of get it it impress upon us and
[16:52] brother R want say think of it before
[16:55] Jesus was ever born 4,000 years before
[16:57] he came on Earth and several thousand
[16:59] years before you come on Earth Jesus in
[17:02] God's mind died for the sins of the
[17:05] world and the Book of Life was made and
[17:07] your name was put on that book of life
[17:09] before the foundation of the world and
[17:10] brother brother R you can go read it how
[17:12] did he put your name on The Book of Life
[17:14] he spoke
[17:15] it that's the Bible truth see your name
[17:18] was ordained of God and placed on the
[17:20] book of life before the foundation of
[17:23] the world before anything was anything
[17:27] happened your name was already inscribed
[17:31] in the in
[17:34] the in in the Eternal attributes of God
[17:37] it was it was part of him and and and so
[17:40] being that is eternal then it's already
[17:44] finished it it it's already it's already
[17:46] done like he thought of it he thought of
[17:49] Jesus of himself coming down and
[17:51] expressing himself in flesh and DED on
[17:53] the cross well it's already
[17:55] done in Revelation 13 it says all that
[17:58] dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him
[17:59] whose names are not written in the L
[18:01] Book of Life of the lamb slain from
[18:02] before the from the foundation of the
[18:04] world so the view from eternity is
[18:07] always that a Christian does not become
[18:11] God's child at the moment of your birth
[18:14] but I'm talking about the view from
[18:15] eternity amen I got this we're swimming
[18:18] in deep water here a little bit good
[18:21] good but the new birth manifest in time
[18:24] like it it expresses right in time what
[18:27] was spiritually true all the way from
[18:29] the beginning now now that's why that's
[18:32] why Paul could
[18:34] say because you are Sons God hath sent
[18:39] forth the spirit of his son into your
[18:40] hearts crying ABA father amen because
[18:43] from the view from eternity you're
[18:45] already sons and that's why he could say
[18:48] before the foundation of the world Jacob
[18:50] have I loved and Esau have I ha it
[18:53] because it's already the scroll is
[18:56] already unrolled out in God's mind
[18:59] you think you think in God's mind he's
[19:01] not just looking up to Le osia he's
[19:02] looking all the way to the white Throne
[19:04] judgment we're looking all the way past
[19:06] that all the way past that all the way
[19:08] past past past amen everything he sees
[19:12] it's already done in his mind amen
[19:15] amen so in John chapter 10 he could say
[19:18] my sheep hear my
[19:19] voice and I know
[19:22] them oh you think you know we come to
[19:25] church and the word's being preached and
[19:27] the minister doesn't know who's going to
[19:28] going to respond or whatever but God
[19:30] already knows to the point when God was
[19:32] manifest in flesh and he he went around
[19:35] calling philli and Nathaniel and Peter
[19:38] he knew that they would respond to the
[19:40] point he he knew who he could walk up to
[19:43] I'll make you Fishers of Men he he could
[19:46] call and and brother there's a statement
[19:47] where he
[19:48] said that he he could call them by name
[19:51] because he knew he knew there that they
[19:54] were his Sheep amen and he said I give
[19:56] unto them eternal life and they shall
[19:57] never perish
[19:59] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[20:01] my hand my Father which gave them me is
[20:03] greater than all and no man is able to
[20:05] pluck them out of my father's hand now
[20:08] now keep in mind the context of what
[20:10] we're talking about we're talking about
[20:11] what what is that Jean seed when brother
[20:14] R said down in your soul you've got
[20:16] something it always was there and the
[20:18] thing in man's filter it always was
[20:20] there you what it is that that there's
[20:23] something that's tied to you there's the
[20:25] thought of God is always thinking about
[20:27] you and there's a potential in your life
[20:30] that you are going to come to and you
[20:32] cannot Escape it because it's who you
[20:35] are God is looking at your
[20:37] characteristics just like he was looking
[20:39] at Jacob and you're going to come to
[20:41] that potential that he saw before the
[20:43] foundation of the world am and that
[20:45] potential is manifested by hearing the
[20:47] word amen so you hear the word he knew
[20:50] that one day you would hear the word and
[20:51] you would receive the word and the word
[20:53] that you heard would Quicken and Blossom
[20:56] into life and what's it quickening the
[20:58] thought that God had before the
[21:00] foundation of the world now is expressed
[21:02] and now it's a reality and that's why
[21:05] brother R said talking about the woman
[21:07] at the well he said there was that
[21:08] predestinated seed down in there and he
[21:10] said what is it it's the thought of God
[21:13] the thought of God that God had before
[21:14] the foundation of the world now it it's
[21:17] it's uh you you begin to meditate on
[21:20] these things and you realize that
[21:22] sometimes the things that brother Ram
[21:23] said are difficult to understand but
[21:25] really there's no other way for him to
[21:27] say it that's right when it's all said
[21:28] and done he said it so perfectly to
[21:31] express this this thing that it's almost
[21:35] how are you going to explain it any
[21:36] other way right Jesus going around
[21:39] calling his disciples he saith unto them
[21:41] follow me and I will make you Fishers of
[21:43] Men he knew exactly he would
[21:46] respond so what's the summation of the
[21:49] matters we're about to close just here
[21:51] in a few minutes you as a child of God
[21:53] or an Inseparable part of the genes of
[21:55] God and the invisible Union of the bride
[21:57] of Christ he said before there was even
[21:59] a moon stars or a molecule you are Sons
[22:01] and Daughters of God for you are the are
[22:04] only the physical manifestation of the
[22:08] attributes that was in God at the
[22:10] beginning amen now there there's an
[22:12] identification when you begin to
[22:13] recognize that what you're living out
[22:15] right now that the eternal life in you
[22:18] really does tie back Amen to the thought
[22:21] that God had before the foundation of
[22:23] the world Amen that right now you are
[22:25] expressing what God thought of Amen that
[22:29] all all of these things that we read
[22:31] about in the scripture in Malachi that
[22:33] that one day that there's going to be a
[22:34] people that are their hearts are turned
[22:36] back that there's going to be a people
[22:38] that can tell uh in in the last days can
[22:41] discern the true and the false all these
[22:43] things that are written of in the
[22:44] scripture now you are expressing that
[22:48] that's why in Christ is revealed in his
[22:49] own word he said if we are Sons and
[22:51] Daughters of God then we are attributes
[22:53] of God Amen now there's the if if if
[22:57] we're Sons and Daughters of God if we've
[22:59] got that eternal life in us then we are
[23:01] attributes of God then we got eternal
[23:03] life and God is the only eternal life
[23:06] there is amen then we were in him from
[23:08] the beginning and when Jesus became all
[23:11] that word then we were a part of him
[23:13] then
[23:15] amen there you are amen when that's in
[23:18] there there is no devil no powers no
[23:23] nothing can ever move it that's the ti
[23:25] poost of the Soul why did he say no
[23:27] devil no powers can never move it yeah
[23:29] Jesus had Jesus had power over the devil
[23:32] cuz he knew who he was and so your
[23:35] identity gives you power over the devil
[23:38] so that's why this is so important when
[23:40] you know that you are the manifested
[23:43] expressed thought of God then it gives
[23:46] you power over the devil because you can
[23:48] stand like Jesus did who is the word and
[23:50] you can say I I listen devil you can't
[23:53] tell me that I'm not born again and and
[23:56] As We Roll Along you can't tell me that
[23:59] I'm not an adopted manifested son of God
[24:02] you can't tell me that I'm not the
[24:04] Fulfillment of what the word says the
[24:07] bride will be in this last day you can't
[24:10] tell me and that's that that's that's
[24:11] we're coming to Identity so what what is
[24:14] a gene a gene is like all these
[24:16] characteristics that now are expressing
[24:18] we talked about that I'm going to skip
[24:20] past that so
[24:22] um here's that quote and we'll stop on
[24:24] this when brother R said in the in this
[24:26] church age that it's not the person
[24:29] here's another quote that's kind of
[24:30] worded in an odd way what does this mean
[24:34] it's not the person that comes
[24:36] predestinated eternally from God is the
[24:38] word or seed that is it way back there
[24:41] too far back for the human mind to grasp
[24:44] the Eternal god with eternal thoughts
[24:46] thought and decreed Jacob have I loved
[24:47] but Esau have I hated and neither was
[24:50] born and neither had done good or evil
[24:52] that's right I thought we just got
[24:53] through saying that you're predestinated
[24:55] eternally but now think about this yeah
[24:58] that you as an individual you ain't you
[25:01] ain't nothing without the word it's the
[25:04] word the Eternal thought the attribute
[25:06] that God thought of before the
[25:08] foundation of the world and God knew
[25:10] that one day you would hear that word
[25:12] and the word you would drop down in your
[25:14] heart and that would be predestinated
[25:16] eternally but you just as a an
[25:19] individual floating alone in your sinful
[25:21] condition you you're without the word
[25:24] you're not predestinated eternally but
[25:26] when the word drops in your heart then
[25:28] in that now you're CAU up to what God
[25:31] thought of and now you continue along
[25:33] that trajectory so we could say that
[25:35] it's the seed word that comes
[25:37] predestinated eternally but when that
[25:39] seed lives in a person the person is
[25:42] part of God's plan and you're caught up
[25:45] into the Eternal and we'll stop right
[25:47] there God bless you
[25:51] [Applause]
