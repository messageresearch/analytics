[18:44] thought that's been on my heart for
[18:47] really it's been on there for many years
[18:50] amen about something that I'm wondering
[18:52] if we're missing the um correct
[18:57] understanding sometimes of things amen
[18:59] and uh you know this has just been there
[19:02] and uh you know I've been pondering how
[19:04] to speak on it and maybe I can get my
[19:06] point across today but it'll be just
[19:09] kind of a little insert into the the
[19:11] study we've been on Amen so if you'd
[19:13] like
[19:16] to and I don't want Mark yet so I was
[19:19] going to use that but we won't use Mark

[19:46] then we stand complete amen and we love
[19:48] you Lord and we want to be that and do
[19:50] as we know that it's been taught us by
[19:52] Thy word that we want to walk therein
[19:55] that we can have confidence Lord in in
[19:58] knowing that you will hear our prayers
[20:00] and answer them and lead us in thy
[20:04] understanding amen have your way now

[22:03] amen know you not that the unrighteous

[22:35] Jesus and by the spirit of God you may
[22:38] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[22:41] the reading of the word
[22:45] now you know we look at those things and
[22:48] we think well now no we we we're not any
[22:52] of these things come on now uh and even
[22:56] if we do we want to make sure we we get
[22:58] it all in the past right you know and
[23:00] that's that's fine but you know we look
[23:03] at the words and what I would ask you to
[23:05] do sometimes is just take these words
[23:07] and look them up right yes sir you know
[23:09] just go to the
[23:11] dictionary and just look up these words
[23:14] go over there in Galatians where it's
[23:16] talking about the works of the
[23:19] flesh you know Murder Envy stri addition
[23:22] well I never killed
[23:24] nobody well you know if you hate your
[23:27] brother without a
[23:29] the Bible says You're a murderer look
[23:31] them up and just see if you can find
[23:34] yourself in some of these things am no
[23:38] no I'm a born again Christian well that
[23:40] may be true but you know we may still
[23:42] have some problems and that's what I
[23:44] want to deal with today is something
[23:46] there's one in there
[23:49] that you know I remember years ago that
[23:53] I had heard brother brandom make the
[23:55] statement and uh I had mentioned this to
[23:57] brother brother Mo and uh brother George
[24:00] I think now I'm not certain but I know
[24:02] it was brother Mo and they were both
[24:04] laughing at me because of the way I
[24:06] pronounce the
[24:07] word but see there we read you know
[24:11] that
[24:13] idolators right idolators yeah and you
[24:17] know I remember hearing the prophet one
[24:19] day said you know how do you going to be
[24:20] an idolator y it just let God be Idol in
[24:25] your life that's right that's right now
[24:30] I tell you what now I a I ain't got no
[24:32] Idols in my home I ain't got no Idols in
[24:34] this I don't have no Idols nowhere but
[24:37] the prophet said that just let God be
[24:39] Idol in your life that's right see and
[24:42] it was really pronouncing I was ID of
[24:45] dollar Tre somewhere you know and that's
[24:46] where I said it cuz that's way I meant
[24:48] it and I can't even pronounce it the way
[24:50] I said it then but they were life in way
[24:52] because it it just means simply you let
[24:55] God be Idol in your
[24:56] life right and you can be an
[25:02] idolator no no no no brother Dale an
[25:05] idolor is one that gets before and bows
[25:08] down and does all of these things you
[25:10] know and all that's that's pretty good
[25:13] thinking but that's not all the
[25:17] point the word
[25:20] idolators it's a
[25:22] worship of false
[25:24] gods
[25:26] right right
[25:28] that's the the definition amen out of
[25:30] out of your 19 1496 out strongs
[25:34] concordance right it can even be a
[25:40] Christian participating in any
[25:43] way in the
[25:46] worship of the
[25:48] Heathen
[25:50] right
[25:52] amen see we think it's got to be going
[25:55] for an idol you know and bowing and
[25:57] doing all things right uh could we be an
[26:02] idolator and not know it right
[26:08] amen that's just a simple point it's
[26:10] been on my mind for many years and I
[26:13] just you
[26:18] know you say but but brother Dale we we
[26:22] we're
[26:23] Christians and and we're not
[26:26] idolators well Paul said such for some
[26:29] of you amen that's right all right so
[26:31] evidently we must have been somewhere
[26:33] yeah and probably they wouldn't be any
[26:36] of us in here that ever even in our
[26:39] sinful life you know when we lost that
[26:42] ever went to an ID and bowed down to it
[26:45] you know or any form of doings right
[26:49] right and I don't believe Paul was just
[26:51] talking about people who have done a lot
[26:54] of those
[26:56] things see because it could be we just
[26:59] let God be Idol in our lives right
[27:04] amen we just don't put him as number one
[27:09] right amen very simple
[27:13] y see now Paul was against as he was
[27:16] bringing as I brought the definition
[27:18] from the strong you know you don't want
[27:21] to eat things offered to sacrifices you
[27:24] know like that not that it's wrong the
[27:27] bases of uh you
[27:30] know maybe in you but he said it's where
[27:33] others see you
[27:35] right y because you you know you go down
[27:38] to the store and you buy a piece of meat
[27:41] you don't ask the the the teller to tell
[27:45] you whether that has been offered uh you
[27:48] know as a sacrifice and yeah to an you
[27:52] know to a God and then uh take it in and
[27:54] butchered and and you wind up with a
[27:56] hamburger out out of there you know you
[27:59] know you don't do stuff like that that's
[28:01] not uh see so Paul when he was just
[28:04] saying
[28:05] it it's something that you know yourself
[28:08] and he said it's for other people's sake
[28:11] right
[28:12] right because they see you eating meat
[28:15] offered to a sacrifice you know altar on
[28:18] it or something and they you know they
[28:20] be offended or hurt by it right because
[28:23] they're young and they're weak and and
[28:25] you don't want to do those things right
[28:27] so kind of keep that in mind now as we
[28:30] go along through something because you
[28:33] know I I want us to think about
[28:39] it the worship of Idols we said we know
[28:42] that's wrong mhm right we know it's
[28:46] wrong to worship idols that's right sure
[28:50] but you know I've been told in this
[28:53] message that you need to keep a picture
[28:55] of
[28:56] Jesus
[28:58] you know and there's a quote to the
[29:00] form keep a picture of Jesus and when
[29:03] you pray go stand before the
[29:05] picture to get your mind on the Lord you
[29:09] know and that may sound like a good
[29:12] point but you mean I've got to get to do
[29:16] that to be able to pray I've got to be
[29:19] able to see a picture to be able to
[29:21] remember who I'm praying to or whatever
[29:26] yeah
[29:30] I remember one time uh listening to
[29:32] brother random and I coming home from
[29:34] work and he was talking about how that
[29:36] we put up these or the people put up
[29:38] these images you know and and I
[29:41] remembered the story there of the Spinx
[29:43] you know the things the the lines that
[29:45] are there before the The Pyramid in
[29:47] Egypt and and you think well now those
[29:50] were put there to guard you know they
[29:52] were were uh Idols you know
[29:55] images and I thought well wish sure
[29:57] don't have anything like that and I
[29:59] thank you Lord and I pull up in my yard
[30:02] and I looked and and there was a swan on
[30:05] each side of the or a duck one I can't
[30:08] remember which one each side of the
[30:10] walkway was a swan you know and I began
[30:14] the
[30:15] life because I was that's what I was
[30:18] thinking about
[30:21] right if you come to our homes sometimes
[30:24] and you think well no you could go down
[30:26] to an idol worshippers home you could
[30:28] really see well it wouldn't be
[30:29] necessarily right you know wouldn't be
[30:32] necessarily that you could see it all
[30:34] right
[30:38] now could it be that we can worship
[30:44] idols and think we're worshiping God
[30:53] sure very serious
[30:56] amen brother randam
[30:59] said you can call him Jesus
[31:03] Jesus and worship the
[31:06] devil
[31:11] sure you know I'm glad that the Bible
[31:13] says that God Winks at our ignorance yes
[31:16] that's right amen I'm glad of that
[31:19] scripture because I believe we've had a
[31:21] whole lot of ignorance and probably a
[31:23] lot of stupidity to go with
[31:26] it but what about calling him Jesus
[31:29] Jesus and be worshiping the devil right
[31:36] amen now what about the scribes and
[31:39] Pharisees claiming to serve the true and
[31:42] living
[31:44] God and yet he was standing before them
[31:46] right
[31:48] yep now who was they worshiping at the
[31:50] time he was standing before
[31:53] them right
[31:56] right
[31:57] come on right amen serious sure who are
[32:02] they
[32:03] worshiping they were singing they were
[32:06] worshiping they were praying they were
[32:07] going through all of their daily rituals
[32:10] and and prayers of long lengthy uh
[32:13] prayers every day and and there was God
[32:17] walking among them right
[32:24] amen odd situation then
[32:27] right the most religious people that has
[32:31] ever been in the
[32:32] world were the scribes and Pharisees
[32:35] right right amen
[32:38] yeah so then we can't say well it's all
[32:40] on sincerity that's
[32:43] right right what about where the Prophet
[32:47] said people feed their babies to
[32:50] alligators to appease a
[32:52] God that's right that's pretty sincere
[32:55] isn't it right amen
[33:01] so we don't just put it on sincerity
[33:03] that's right amen it has to be bed based
[33:06] upon something
[33:09] else it has to be based
[33:12] upon two
[33:14] things one is the word yes amen that's
[33:19] right all right the other is a personal
[33:22] experience amen
[33:25] amen that's right and if those two are
[33:28] not
[33:30] together what are we doing right amen
[33:32] that's
[33:33] right now come on just be serious minded
[33:36] in yourself for a moment and
[33:39] think I don't ask for a raise of hands
[33:42] cuz everybody's handing you already to
[33:43] go up if he didn't go up I tell you it's
[33:44] a liar not putting it up we all
[33:48] worshiped
[33:50] Gods sure
[33:53] man no no no no no no mhm M what did did
[33:58] you believe in a
[34:02] trinity well I don't been through all of
[34:04] that so don't worry about it I've had
[34:06] people to tell me say well God knows who
[34:09] I'm worshiping
[34:11] yeah yeah but do you know who you're
[34:17] worshiping that's what people will say
[34:19] to you right God knows my heart yes he
[34:23] knows that I love him he knows that I'm
[34:26] wor shiing him right I don't have to be
[34:29] able to get all the names right
[34:36] right a little woman one day tried to
[34:39] contact the Lord Jesus about a healing
[34:40] and he said it's not right for me to
[34:43] take the children's bread and give it to
[34:45] a dog y That's Right amen but you know
[34:48] she had more understanding than all them
[34:50] scribes and Pharisees that's right amen
[34:53] because she had enough understanding to
[34:54] realize there was something about the
[34:56] man so she said true but the dogs get
[35:00] the crumbs that fall from the master's
[35:03] table right right he said I found S no
[35:06] such faith in Israel that's right amen
[35:10] right what about
[35:14] it pull up Mark there brother Joe and M
[35:17] do I told him I give him all a rest
[35:19] today just think a few things and you
[35:22] know I already got this evening lined up
[35:25] so they don't even have to sit back
[35:26] there
[35:27] you knowbody can sit out here and we
[35:30] really appreciate these brothers what
[35:31] they do also for before we forget it uh
[35:35] remember on the uh not this coming
[35:38] weekend now but the on the 8th we're
[35:41] supposed to be up at uh brother Bill y's
[35:44] Church to have a ministers meeting and
[35:47] it's on Daniel 70 weeks and Wade and I
[35:49] are supposed to speak before you know we
[35:54] they're designated speakers now and
[35:56] they're we're going to speak a little
[35:58] bit before we get into questions and
[36:00] answers for so remember that amen amen
[36:04] mainly that we will both have the right
[36:06] attitude right
[36:09] amen and it's kind of like brother Reed
[36:11] said he we were just talking going down
[36:14] the road the other day and he said
[36:15] brother Dale I know it's been
[36:18] hard for some of your older ones that
[36:21] really know the message and have tried
[36:23] to study it and teach it to the people
[36:26] and people won't receive it but said
[36:28] maybe now's the time right and Wade was
[36:31] bringing out last night you know what
[36:33] brother Claude weinger was saying that
[36:35] you know the Bible does say that it
[36:37] would be in the last days when the
[36:39] Daniel 70 weeks would be able to be
[36:40] understood that's right amen you know
[36:43] cuz that would be it's the book sealed
[36:44] up in the Book of Daniel right right
[36:46] until the end right well just pray for
[36:51] us that the Lord would help us you
[36:53] remember years ago we were fixing to go
[36:55] to one that was going to be on a topic
[36:57] and the Lord spoke to me right over in
[36:59] the corner there of what the scripture
[37:02] truth was and when we got there that was
[37:04] the very scripture the man brought up
[37:06] right well I felt pretty good yeah
[37:10] because I already had the answer right
[37:13] all right so just pray that we'll have
[37:15] the right answer right attitude okay
[37:17] look at Mark now look at what the Lord
[37:19] Jesus now what who is he God Almighty
[37:22] amen standing
[37:25] there and look what he says he answered
[37:28] and said unto them well have isaas
[37:30] prophesied of you Hypocrites as it is
[37:33] written the people honored me with their
[37:35] lips y but their heart is far from me
[37:39] now look what he says how be it in vain
[37:42] they being in vain do they worship me
[37:47] right yeah now how is it that you
[37:49] worship God how is it you can worship
[37:51] God in
[37:53] vain simply the next few words right
[37:56] right
[37:57] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[37:59] of men
[38:02] y y so now do you see why brother around
[38:04] would say you can say Jesus Jesus and
[38:07] worship the devil amen right cuz if you
[38:10] got the doctrines of
[38:12] men Y how can you be worshiping the true
[38:16] God that's right amen now we go back to
[38:18] the while go God knows my heart yeah if
[38:22] he didn't we'd be in pretty good shape
[38:24] yeah right that's right that's
[38:29] right look what he
[38:32] says for laying aside the Commandment of
[38:35] God right yep now you notice singular
[38:40] commandment
[38:42] right y now
[38:45] watch he's talking about
[38:48] worship right
[38:51] right
[38:54] yep we're laying aside the commandment
[38:57] of God what is the first
[38:59] commandment amen one not all of them
[39:02] what's the first cuz that's what he's
[39:03] saying right he's dealing with worship
[39:05] of God right what's the first
[39:09] commandment there's only one Lord
[39:13] amen right amen and his name is one
[39:17] right amen that's right so anything
[39:19] besides true worship in spirit and in
[39:23] truth
[39:25] amen is idolatry amen
[39:30] right amen you see how serious you see
[39:33] why I've been thinking on it for many
[39:34] many years to try to present a way you
[39:37] know to see what's on my heart with
[39:38] thinking about
[39:42] it for laying aside the Commandment of
[39:45] God you hold the tradition of men as the
[39:48] washing of pots and cups and many other
[39:50] such like things you
[39:53] do and he said unto them for will well
[39:57] you reject the Commandment of God that
[40:00] you may keep your own tradition
[40:06] amen what about rejecting
[40:11] God because
[40:14] of your own thinking our teaching
[40:17] right
[40:19] yep I said now I thank God for that
[40:23] scripture that he said I went at your
[40:25] ignorance
[40:27] right but what's the rest of that
[40:29] scripture but says now he commands all
[40:33] men to repent right right repent for
[40:37] what for idolatry right
[40:40] amen
[40:43] Y come on folks you understand what I'm
[40:45] saying from the pull pit to the back of
[40:47] the building we were all in idolatry oh
[40:50] we belied in a
[40:53] trinity or either a Oneness right
[40:59] until this message came to straighten us
[41:01] out and bring us to truth we could not
[41:04] be worshiping in spirit and in truth
[41:07] right amen right
[41:14] right see
[41:16] sincerity that's all people talk
[41:19] about well you know God knows I love him

[43:43] Pastor now could you worship God in
[43:48] vain sure now Jesus said you do it
[43:53] because of your teaching of your

[44:54] sincere you ain't fed your kids to the
[45:00] alligator
[45:07] right could we be worshiping here in
[45:13] vain and we certainly wouldn't be like
[45:16] others that we think
[45:18] of you know the children of
[45:22] Israel they actually put their kids
[45:24] through fire mhm under molok every how
[45:28] you pronounce it that's right m o l e c
[45:31] or something like
[45:33] that that's right you mean the people of
[45:36] God mhm you mean the people of God that
[45:39] had seen all the things down in Egypt
[45:41] and all the destruction of all of that
[45:44] and get out there and
[45:47] MH some way convince Aaron
[45:51] to make a golden cave yeah come on right
[45:56] and they were going to take that golden
[45:57] C and they wern't going back to Egypt as
[46:00] slaves you know better than that they
[46:02] were going back as borus to say this is
[46:05] the god that killed you you fool with us
[46:07] he'll get you
[46:11] again
[46:13] right but they danc before those that
[46:16] Idol
[46:18] y they done all kind of
[46:21] things thought they was worshiping yep
[46:27] could it be that that they
[46:31] thought because we'll get to the
[46:32] statement in a minute could it be that
[46:35] they thought that their
[46:37] God had condescended into that Idol
[46:43] right like I said I don't think they
[46:45] going back to Slaves you I don't think
[46:47] they doing that I think they were going
[46:49] to go back is Victorious right
[46:54] mhm
[46:58] could it be that they thought they were
[47:04] right I mean there was only Moses was
[47:07] the only fell left that wasn't involved
[47:10] in it right yep no you say well now wait
[47:13] just a minute well now the rest of them
[47:15] wouldn't do anything about it right come
[47:18] on be plain Moses was the only one now
[47:23] when he come back down with his presence
[47:26] everybody else jumps up and says Moses
[47:27] I'm on your side yeah but what was he
[47:30] doing till Moses came down they might
[47:33] not have been dancing
[47:35] but you ever notice
[47:37] kids you know that it's kind of made
[47:39] that way I guess but you take them
[47:42] around where the music is playing and
[47:43] them little
[47:46] kids you know and they've never been
[47:48] taught this it's just something about it
[47:52] you know you understand what I'm saying
[47:55] sure
[47:56] we're all of the tribes of
[47:59] Israel out there somewhere pretty close
[48:01] that a wild that they had
[48:05] Y what about
[48:10] it Amen brother said that people will
[48:13] even believe and bow before an idol and
[48:16] he says that they don't necessarily
[48:18] believe that that Idol is their God so
[48:21] they believe that that Idol is in an
[48:22] image form or likeness or something of
[48:26] their
[48:27] God you know because they know if that
[48:29] gets burnt up they just get them another
[48:30] one you remember that's what uh Abraham
[48:34] or Abram was doing you know who was it
[48:36] his daddy-in-law that was making Idols
[48:38] or something and Dad and he was out
[48:40] there happing him and and he's
[48:42] worshiping them Idols too or either he
[48:44] was just going along the whole thing
[48:45] until the true one come along and then
[48:48] he just burn up the story of the old
[48:49] Jewish story is that he he just broke
[48:52] them all up and he said he left one he
[48:54] said you know you
[48:56] know they got into a fight last night
[48:59] all these gods did said this one won you
[49:04] that's old Jewish Fable yeah but think
[49:07] about
[49:08] it but around and said you can bow
[49:10] before an
[49:12] ID in an imaginary way believing that
[49:16] your God came into that idle
[49:19] right and said even your
[49:23] voices sure
[49:28] come
[49:33] on don't you think Satan can
[49:35] speak sure he knew how to use the tongue
[49:38] of a beast
[49:42] abely but I'm just asking this a simple
[49:46] question how do you know that you're not
[49:48] in idolatry right now
[49:53] right remember we're in the day of all
[49:55] full responsibility right amen
[49:59] right so we have no excuse and God's not
[50:02] going to wink at are ignorance right
[50:05] there's no excuse to have doctrines like
[50:07] in this message right amen that's
[50:10] right but the biggest problem is and you
[50:13] know it's true you can have a guy with a
[50:14] Doctrine he get him another doctorine
[50:16] two or three Doctrine he's more popular
[50:18] than somebody that stands up and says
[50:20] that's not right true
[50:23] right sure you remember when Moses the
[50:27] ground opened up and swallowed up all of
[50:30] those people you remember the next day
[50:33] yeah they come to Moses and you know
[50:35] what they say Moses you kill the people
[50:39] of God
[50:40] right yeah boy that's something read
[50:44] your Bible
[50:48] mhm it don't take a whole lot for us to
[50:51] be in idolatry
[50:54] amen so started what I said let him be
[50:57] idle
[50:59] y that's my problem I don't know about
[51:02] you right amen the biggest one I have is
[51:04] letting him be idle right but I keep my
[51:07] mind on so many other
[51:09] things instead of keeping it on Goden
[51:18] right man I want to try to illustrate
[51:20] cuz this is what's been on my mind so
[51:21] just think wom me
[51:24] listen
[51:26] you know since the beginning of
[51:29] time man being a
[51:32] creature that was created by a Creator
[51:35] would put him into a position to want to
[51:39] serve
[51:41] that Creator right right amen you
[51:45] know make all kind of things to try
[51:49] to
[51:51] appease
[51:53] satisfied you know
[51:56] they're
[51:58] God you go all the way down through the
[52:00] Bible and you find like I said even the
[52:02] children of isra running their children
[52:04] Through
[52:06] Fire to try to appease a
[52:09] god that is
[52:16] dead now there's plenty of gods but
[52:18] those gods are just the the the point of
[52:21] the
[52:22] mind because there's only one God
[52:26] right the others are not Gods right
[52:30] they're concoctions of
[52:32] somebody
[52:34] yeah it makes up some kind of a form and
[52:37] call them Gods right Amen brother
[52:40] brother P said there I think he said 3
[52:43] million gods and goddesses right y over
[52:45] in India y we know Paul run up out of
[52:49] Mars heill he found all these things all
[52:51] these things and there one little maybe
[52:54] a what you call it little pedestal
[52:56] sitting there and you know and they
[52:59] wrote down under it just in case we miss
[53:01] him this will be the unknown

[53:07] to talk to you about right
[53:09] amen amen is the unknown
[53:13] God CU there's one thing for certain

[54:18] representation of
[54:23] him so talk to you about the unknown God

[54:30] amen cuz you see if you don't know the
[54:32] truth all gods are unknown amen that's
[54:36] right amen there's only one God
[54:39] Amen what about
[54:42] it y simple
[54:45] thoughts
[54:50] amen all kind of doctrines and ideas and
[54:54] gods and
[54:56] goddesses you know that they all have
[55:00] somebody who is their high priest or
[55:02] whatever you want to call him you know
[55:04] not those words necessarily for
[55:05] everybody but you know what I mean by it
[55:08] everybody's got their representation
[55:11] right sure you
[55:15] know and they want to send somebody to
[55:17] represent that y kind of makes me think
[55:20] about that man brother dick that me and
[55:21] you were talking about that time that
[55:23] was a the it was a Church of Christ but
[55:25] he just totally backslid you know I mean
[55:28] but when they wanted somebody to argue
[55:29] the Church of Christ Doctrine they go
[55:31] get that old guy that even just totally
[55:34] back you know cuz he was good with words
[55:38] I'm sure you know see it didn't make no
[55:41] difference to them whether he was a
[55:42] Christian or not right they just wanted
[55:44] somebody to be able to convince the
[55:47] others well what about
[55:50] it is this message just a a doctrinal
[55:53] issue yeah
[55:55] all
[55:58] right or is it a revelation of a person
[56:09] amen so we say then as I said while ago
[56:12] the first is word the second would have
[56:15] to be a personal experience right amen
[56:17] you know something real to you
[56:23] right right now here's Abram you know he
[56:27] become labor
[56:30] Abraham Paul picks it up in Romans you
[56:32] know and he said that Abraham believed
[56:36] God and it was imputed unto him for
[56:38] righteousness
[56:39] right but we turn his way sitting
[56:41] holding the book up and looking at both
[56:43] sides we look back and it was really
[56:44] Abram that done it right he starts off
[56:49] yeah he doesn't wait till you get away
[56:52] on over here to start having him as a
[56:53] Believer yeah you know
[56:56] right Abram was the one that believed
[56:59] God right sure
[57:01] y because when he spoke to him about the
[57:04] 12th chapter somewhere right along in
[57:05] there you know God just spoke to him
[57:09] Y and he said
[57:12] Abram get
[57:14] up leave where you're at right all your
[57:18] Idols you know
[57:20] yeah
[57:22] yep and said just come walk with
[57:29] me well we know is I guess wait to bring
[57:33] that to the night but somebody was just
[57:34] recently that you know Abram he he took
[57:37] his family he took lot he took yeah you
[57:40] know everybody with him which that was
[57:42] what God Said but I mean that was
[57:44] sensible that wasn't bad you know
[57:47] because you know you want your family to
[57:49] see the truth don't you well you ain't
[57:51] going to just say well the door's closed
[57:53] when you find God the way I got him you
[57:56] get back in this door until then stay
[57:59] out that's kind of the way we are right
[58:03] you ain't going to win nobody that way
[58:05] right but oh ABR he just gets up you
[58:08] know and he just he hears a voice
[58:10] something spoke to him
[58:13] right and what made him any
[58:16] different oh he was a seed see there you
[58:20] message people yeah they just SE this
[58:23] thing to death you know yeah right
[58:28] like I was thinking the other day about
[58:29] where were they using the uh Judah and
[58:32] the Tamar you know to extend the lineage
[58:35] well you better go back and read your
[58:37] Bible Judah and Tamar had two kids
[58:42] yeah they just didn't have one right
[58:45] yeah they had two kids that was twins
[58:48] right I say the lineage went down to
[58:50] Perez or what his name is well you know
[58:53] both of them come from one
[58:57] man right that was Judah right y but you
[59:01] see we just don't
[59:03] think but just get the point
[59:07] now why did Abram believe
[59:13] God you know that there's like the
[59:15] prophet that said you know there's
[59:16] people that just can't believe that's
[59:18] right I told you about that old man down
[59:19] at work and in his mouth his name was
[59:22] Dozer and brother was talking to him
[59:23] about them going out in the desert you
[59:25] know I mean going up into the moon and
[59:28] thing he he went out there the desert
[59:30] somewhere so down you know he wouldn't
[59:32] believe it right well you know what if
[59:35] you tapped him on the head and sent him
[59:37] up to the moon and woke him up he
[59:39] wouldn't believe it
[59:42] then he said I didn't just got this
[59:44] place made around here I find my door
[59:46] get out and I'll be back home you know
[59:48] all
[59:51] right but what makes the difference amen
[59:54] come on
[59:58] why is it so emphatically states that
[1:00:00] Abraham believed
[1:00:03] God who
[1:00:05] imputed yes right amen well there's
[1:00:09] Abram he's got a good living going help
[1:00:11] his daddy-in-law make idols and
[1:00:13] something and he's doing fine and he
[1:00:16] says get up and go
[1:00:19] y you know what yeah he just got up and
[1:00:23] WI
[1:00:25] right right right right well now my
[1:00:29] point is is we talk about
[1:00:32] believing that's what I want to dwell on
[1:00:34] right MH amen well I
[1:00:38] believe well you know Abram believed
[1:00:41] enough of what spoke to him to get up
[1:00:44] and leave all of the Comforts that he
[1:00:47] had and all of the things and go
[1:00:49] marching and didn't know where he was
[1:00:53] going
[1:00:57] that's right what does it mean that you
[1:01:00] can
[1:01:01] believe I just
[1:01:03] believe well there was one day you
[1:01:05] believed God was three
[1:01:08] persons righten
[1:01:12] right you Tau that you believed it
[1:01:18] y so what about
[1:01:22] it no Abram just gets
[1:01:25] up and he just starts
[1:01:31] walking cuz there was just something
[1:01:34] about what spoke to
[1:01:41] it something about the voice y that
[1:01:46] spoke to it and I don't believe that he
[1:01:49] heard an audible I may different you may
[1:01:51] different brother I may you say it I'm
[1:01:52] not I'm just tring to make a point I
[1:01:54] don't believe he necessarily heard an
[1:01:56] audible voice out loud you know get up
[1:01:59] and come and go with
[1:02:01] me it's just something inside of
[1:02:11] him is anything ever really ever spoke
[1:02:14] to you inside of
[1:02:19] you I mean just literally spoke to you
[1:02:21] that you knew right that there was no
[1:02:24] way anybody could take away from you
[1:02:25] what was
[1:02:30] said you get the
[1:02:34] point brother whby had a good point he
[1:02:36] said you can get them in with a hot dog
[1:02:37] and get them out with the hamburger
[1:02:39] that's right simple Point somebody can
[1:02:42] convince you today that there's a
[1:02:43] trinity tomorrow he can convince you
[1:02:45] their Oneness is
[1:02:47] right
[1:02:51] right but oh AB he just gets up and
[1:02:53] starts walk okay now all of the
[1:02:57] contacts that God made with him of mzd
[1:03:00] and all
[1:03:02] Etc is in his life's journey right
[1:03:05] that's fine right but he got up and left
[1:03:13] right what about
[1:03:17] it there was a man out there one day in
[1:03:20] the Bible that
[1:03:21] was gathering his wheat and stuff and
[1:03:27] he knew the enemy was coming so they
[1:03:29] would gather a little bit and they'd
[1:03:30] hide it in the caves and things and you
[1:03:33] know cuz they knew the enemy was coming
[1:03:36] to get to
[1:03:37] B and they hide enough to maybe make it
[1:03:40] a year and enough to plan or
[1:03:43] something and he was out there doing
[1:03:45] that right
[1:03:48] amen and here they
[1:03:53] come
[1:03:57] do you know something spoke to
[1:04:01] him might have been an angel come
[1:04:05] down said Gideon you're a mighty man of
[1:04:09] Valor he said no I'm a sticking coward
[1:04:12] yeah I would be hiding this fruit in I
[1:04:14] mean this stuff in the cave I was really
[1:04:17] a you know yeah but you know something
[1:04:19] just spoke to
[1:04:21] him you know what he said
[1:04:26] I'm
[1:04:27] true ain't running no more
[1:04:30] y you you going to get my wheat you
[1:04:33] going to have to kill me y right come on
[1:04:36] I'm just making plain language right you
[1:04:38] read your Bible we get plain language
[1:04:40] when you read it
[1:04:43] amen he just don't something told me
[1:04:45] that
[1:04:48] mhm you know I believe it
[1:04:52] right you got to just started SS yeah
[1:04:56] killing a bunch of them run them all
[1:05:01] off
[1:05:03] Y what about it how many more
[1:05:06] illustrations do you need Through the
[1:05:07] Bible to be able to understand
[1:05:11] right I'm asking a simple
[1:05:15] question have you ever really heard the
[1:05:18] voice of God that's right right from
[1:05:20] within
[1:05:23] yes
[1:05:26] you said when I brother R would hear his
[1:05:28] voice you know that's all
[1:05:30] right I told you about the man at work
[1:05:32] that said the Lord spoke to him in an
[1:05:34] audible voice told him get baptized in
[1:05:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:05:40] yeah he got baptized father son Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost and Lord Jesus
[1:05:44] Christ now that was what God Said right
[1:05:48] then he said an audible voice I'm not
[1:05:50] going to argue with
[1:05:53] him
[1:05:55] do I believe God can speak in an audible
[1:06:01] voice but what about it what do you base
[1:06:05] your whole Christian experience
[1:06:09] upon
[1:06:12] amen when I go to church I believe the
[1:06:15] Mage it's all Pharisees y amen
[1:06:19] right right right only the worst part of
[1:06:22] it they're sadu sees you know the
[1:06:24] difference the Pharisees and the
[1:06:25] Sadducees one of is Happy other is
[1:06:28] sad carnal comparison but true because
[1:06:32] the Sadducees didn't believe in nothing
[1:06:34] they didn't believe in no Resurrection
[1:06:35] or nothing so they're sad yeah well
[1:06:37] that's just what I'm looking at now is a
[1:06:40] lot of sad
[1:06:42] faces am I looking at Sadducees or
[1:06:47] yeah a lot of you are sad I see it would
[1:06:50] be a best way of saying
[1:06:53] it that's
[1:06:55] right what do you base your life
[1:06:58] on right
[1:07:02] amen I get the point cuz like I told you
[1:07:04] I've been I don't really know 10 years
[1:07:06] at
[1:07:07] least thinking about this and a way to
[1:07:14] presented God just spoke to Abram and he
[1:07:17] got up and
[1:07:19] Loud was he anything
[1:07:22] different than anybody else
[1:07:26] right I said that's where all the people
[1:07:28] of the message in the preacher they want
[1:07:30] to preach about this seed stuff well he
[1:07:32] was a seed and that's why that that he
[1:07:34] would be like
[1:07:40] that if that be true I still ask you the
[1:07:43] same question right has God ever spoke
[1:07:46] to
[1:07:49] you to where you know where you're at
[1:07:51] right
[1:07:52] yes like I told you when he spoke to me
[1:07:55] right over there in the corner we was
[1:07:56] going to a meeting it was going to be
[1:07:58] and I was going to have to face a
[1:07:59] theologian on marriage and
[1:08:02] divorce right and I had no fear
[1:08:05] whatsoever amen that's right why because
[1:08:08] he done spoke right
[1:08:13] amen you ever been that
[1:08:16] way are can somebody talk you out of
[1:08:19] what you believe
[1:08:21] right you're two soul today a seven
[1:08:23] under tomorrow or peria the next day or
[1:08:26] river Jordans or what all the new ones
[1:08:28] are coming I don't
[1:08:31] know and like I said you know there's
[1:08:33] always a Kingpin or a hierarchy or
[1:08:38] something that you know they'll tell you
[1:08:41] the way to get to heaven is you got to
[1:08:43] believe in this and and you know you got
[1:08:45] to do this and like Catholicism you got
[1:08:48] certain things to go through or some of
[1:08:50] the denominations you got to go through
[1:08:52] steps before you can be accepted into
[1:08:56] the Believers of that
[1:09:01] group you know they got them in the
[1:09:03] message you don't believe what I preach
[1:09:05] you're
[1:09:06] lost oh oh
[1:09:10] yeah what about
[1:09:15] it have always thought and
[1:09:18] said I used to too brother colie hear
[1:09:21] this you'll know
[1:09:22] it
[1:09:24] we were coming back out of Carolina
[1:09:26] talking about something one day and I
[1:09:28] said brother collie I ain't got but one
[1:09:31] desire I said to plant enough word into
[1:09:34] your
[1:09:36] heart until if something happens to the
[1:09:38] man you're listening to that you will
[1:09:40] keep on
[1:09:42] going and you won't be bickering over
[1:09:45] what to do or let's go play the tapes of
[1:09:48] brother Dale yeah right we've got them
[1:09:50] all now we've captured
[1:09:52] them
[1:09:58] I said I want you to be able to stand on
[1:10:00] your own two
[1:10:01] feet that's right that's my desire for
[1:10:04] everybody in this church amen is if
[1:10:06] you're not to be carried about by every
[1:10:07] men I mean wind of doctrines and ideas
[1:10:10] and
[1:10:11] thoughts to be able to stand on what you
[1:10:14] believe right and have an experience
[1:10:17] with
[1:10:21] God like way was talking about the other
[1:10:24] day see I'm telling them how many times
[1:10:26] God spoke to different people in the
[1:10:27] days of Abraham
[1:10:32] absolutely
[1:10:33] right yeah sure remember we get over the
[1:10:37] New Testament a little while many are
[1:10:38] called but few are
[1:10:41] chosen right that's right many people
[1:10:44] are called that's
[1:10:47] right but there's a few chosen right
[1:10:50] amen what's the difference the called
[1:10:52] and the chosen
[1:10:58] you know we play with scriptures and
[1:10:59] don't think of them
[1:11:01] seriously Jesus said no
[1:11:04] man can come to me Y unless my father
[1:11:09] amen draw him right amen that's
[1:11:14] right have you ever felt the
[1:11:17] drawing the

[1:11:42] and do this or do that what's the
[1:11:44] difference in all that than the

[1:11:51] the the uh order or are ways you have to
[1:11:54] be to come in to believe a certain kind
[1:11:56] of a hedonistic Doctrine or or an idol

[1:16:46] Amen on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:16:48] Holy Ghost fell we talk about tongues of
[1:16:51] fire sitting on them but you know the
[1:16:53] reason it was is because inside of them
[1:16:57] was the Holy
[1:16:58] Spirit that's right tongue setting on
[1:17:02] you do you know good that's
[1:17:07] right anointing on you won't do you any
[1:17:10] good that's right you ain't got
[1:17:12] something down in the Heart Right
[1:17:16] amen have you had a person of experience
[1:17:19] with God that you know that God is real
[1:17:21] amen right
[1:17:23] and what if you were taken right now and
[1:17:25] put on the desert island all by yourself
[1:17:27] would you be a
[1:17:31] Christian you know just a carnal
[1:17:33] comparison
[1:17:37] right would you a Christian
[1:17:41] yes if you didn't have anybody else to
[1:17:43] prop you up
[1:17:51] with I'm very serious
[1:17:57] folks I'd rather be left with one person
[1:17:59] sitting in this building that had had an
[1:18:01] experience with
[1:18:03] God and for every one of these pews to
[1:18:05] be full the people has never had one
[1:18:08] right amen yes sir
[1:18:11] abely was not that what was it Martin or
[1:18:14] Columbo one said he never satisfied that
[1:18:17] everybody in this church had the baptism
[1:18:18] of the Holy Ghost and led of the spirit
[1:18:20] of God right that's all my desire amen
[1:18:23] that's right if I die and go to hell and
[1:18:25] miss a whole thing I would just love to
[1:18:26] be able for God to say one thing as I'm
[1:18:28] going toward hell thank you for helping
[1:18:30] them yeah right amen true thank you for
[1:18:34] helping them cuz they found Christ
[1:18:37] through what you said right

[1:19:05] living in adultery doing all kind of
[1:19:07] things and yet he still

[1:19:21] David right
[1:19:23] adulterous having his best friend kill
[1:19:26] to get his wife God says he's a man
[1:19:28] after my own
[1:19:29] heart that's something
[1:19:32] man now we certainly know that that's
[1:19:36] not God's heart that was in all that
[1:19:37] adulterous and all those act my life
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:42] amen but the Bible said that your
[1:19:45] sacrifice and your offerings is become a
[1:19:47] stink in my
[1:19:49] nostrils right we said I look to those
[1:19:52] so an honest and a contrite
[1:19:57] heart amen that
[1:20:01] scripture have you had an experience in
[1:20:04] your heart that you know where you

[1:20:22] in your heart now he didn't say if you
[1:20:24] were led by a bunch of other things he
[1:20:25] said if you got Christ in your heart you
[1:20:27] can't wait till the door open that's
[1:20:30] right right right amen I don't have to
[1:20:32] worry about preaching it do I right
[1:20:36] y I thought we said that the Bible said
[1:20:39] You shall know the
[1:20:41] truth and the truth will set you free
[1:20:43] right amen I thought we believe that he
[1:20:46] sent his word and healed us amen amen
[1:20:50] right amen and delivered us from from
[1:20:56] destruction do you realize what they're
[1:20:58] saying
[1:21:03] yes all these others and I'm not thr off
[1:21:06] on nobody you know that I'm just
[1:21:07] truthful all these other great faith
[1:21:09] healers and all kind of thing they got
[1:21:11] to build everything up they got to get
[1:21:12] everything to go they got to sing they
[1:21:14] got to worship and do everything right
[1:21:16] amen that's right here's brother
[1:21:17] brandham says now let's just be real
[1:21:21] quiet
[1:21:23] right let's just be real quiet
[1:21:26] now so don't be jumping up running
[1:21:28] around now cuz you're going to hinder
[1:21:29] somebody else that's
[1:21:31] right let's just think about
[1:21:34] it said just get the Lord on your mind
[1:21:37] and just think about
[1:21:40] him that's right the still Small
[1:21:47] Voice and you'd rather have the one
[1:21:50] outwardly or the one inwardly
[1:21:53] right amen which
[1:21:58] one which one do you
[1:22:02] want you can take the outward
[1:22:05] voice as I said about the boy that told
[1:22:07] me that God spoke to him in an audible
[1:22:09] voice told him to get baptized in the
[1:22:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and some
[1:22:12] of you may not heard the story so I'll
[1:22:14] relate it he went to a Baptist preacher
[1:22:17] and the Baptist preacher baptized him
[1:22:19] and he said he baptized me both ways
[1:22:20] well I immediately stopped him and said
[1:22:22] hold it
[1:22:24] I'm going to tell you what you've
[1:22:26] done you had that man to baptize you in
[1:22:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:22:31] then he baptized you in Father Son and
[1:22:33] Holy
[1:22:34] Ghost he said you're right I said you
[1:22:37] never was baptized you erased it y I
[1:22:39] said had you been to where you didn't
[1:22:41] know then let him baptize you in the
[1:22:42] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:22:45] and then baptize you in the name of the
[1:22:47] Lord Jesus Christ I said God would have
[1:22:48] been sincere but God told you to get
[1:22:50] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:52] Christ right
[1:22:53] he told me he said don't talk to me no
[1:22:55] more about what that man Brown says you
[1:22:58] can only put it in your own
[1:23:01] words don't tell me what he said he
[1:23:04] wasn't talking to Brandon when he was
[1:23:05] talking to me yeah right right right I
[1:23:09] don't say that disrespectful he wasn't
[1:23:11] talking to brother Brown he's talking to
[1:23:12] me I was the one that come up with the
[1:23:14] point of saying
[1:23:15] that but listen church I'm sure that boy
[1:23:19] is probably still going to church still
[1:23:22] to serve
[1:23:28] God
[1:23:31] yep see the Audible Voice you can hear
[1:23:33] it you can be talked out of it that's
[1:23:36] right because all things is audible y
[1:23:40] right and you can use a way to of matter
[1:23:43] of convincement to win the person over
[1:23:46] through their head sure and was not that
[1:23:49] where Satan went in the garden that's
[1:23:51] right yep am I true he went to the head
[1:23:55] to convince
[1:23:58] Eve
[1:24:05] y but if God spoke in the
[1:24:09] heart you can't take that out of a
[1:24:11] person that's right am that's
[1:24:17] right that's why you see people that can
[1:24:20] be saved that's what I said Jesus said
[1:24:23] you can't come to me unless my father
[1:24:25] draw
[1:24:26] right so it wouldn't matter how many
[1:24:28] alar calls we had begged and pleaded and
[1:24:31] all to get your children saved that's
[1:24:33] not going to save one of them that's
[1:24:34] right right even if it does it's going
[1:24:36] to make a two-fold child the hell out of
[1:24:38] them because they're going to come to
[1:24:39] the altar because mom and daddy wanted
[1:24:41] them there I'm never my kids are sitting
[1:24:44] here all three of them sitting here the
[1:24:45] grandkids are sitting
[1:24:49] here I know I'm a very bad granddaddy on
[1:24:52] know a father and a husband and all but
[1:24:54] I never believed in trying to convince
[1:24:56] anybody of
[1:24:57] anything I've never tried to convince my
[1:25:00] wife and she's sitting right there she
[1:25:01] can tell you I've never tried to
[1:25:03] convince her of what something was right
[1:25:06] right I've tried to tell her what was
[1:25:09] right tried to tell the kids what was
[1:25:11] right the grandkids the
[1:25:16] daughter-in-laws they came to our
[1:25:19] home when they were still in the world
[1:25:21] before they ever come to the Lord and
[1:25:22] they came to our
[1:25:24] home dressed wrong and different thing I
[1:25:27] never said a word to one of them they're
[1:25:29] both sitting back there now they can get
[1:25:31] up and say
[1:25:33] it see I never said a word to them right
[1:25:37] cuz I
[1:25:38] know if God don't speak to you inwardly
[1:25:41] that's right all I'm making is a convert
[1:25:44] that's
[1:25:45] right a convert to a Doctrine a convert
[1:25:49] to an idea or a precept that's right yes
[1:25:52] sir

[1:26:04] churches come on now you better listen
[1:26:07] cuz you mis interpret me I'm
[1:26:11] sorry I don't have an hour and a half to
[1:26:13] explain it I've explained it enough to
[1:26:16] you right what they taught you in them
[1:26:18] denominational churches that a baby as a
[1:26:20] child coming up you come out
[1:26:22] singing Praise Father Son and Holy
[1:26:26] Ghost
[1:26:29] trinities but don't you think you order
[1:26:31] letters to the Lord I didn't say that
[1:26:32] now I've explained that so go
[1:26:37] ahead they were doing the best they
[1:26:39] could do and that was fine but God one
[1:26:42] day spoke to
[1:26:45] you and said come
[1:26:49] on well that's what we say isn't it
[1:26:51] right we said oh if God would speak to
[1:26:54] me like he spoke to Abraham
[1:26:56] yeah I keep emphasizing it was Abram he
[1:27:00] talking to right
[1:27:02] abely making no difference in all of us
[1:27:05] right right amen when Abraham that's way
[1:27:09] on over in this journey
[1:27:12] right y but you
[1:27:16] see a lot of people hear the voice of
[1:27:20] God yep
[1:27:22] they hear it by radio by whatever you
[1:27:25] know forms are preachers preaching in
[1:27:26] the pull pit and they make up their mind
[1:27:30] that they're going to become one of
[1:27:35] those they go to
[1:27:38] church and they try to live by a Cod of
[1:27:40] rules and ethics or forms or whatever
[1:27:42] you want to call
[1:27:44] it that's why I Don't Preach like these
[1:27:47] other
[1:27:48] preachers sometimes I'll bring in a
[1:27:50] thought and put it in about you women in
[1:27:52] your hair and your dresses the men in
[1:27:54] their clothing and thing but I just put

[1:30:00] the Bible don't say that cleanness is
[1:30:02] next to godl this it doesn't say that
[1:30:03] but that's a good
[1:30:05] saying you I remember a guy down at work

[1:31:13] mirror and realize Jesus Christ is
[1:31:15] looking at you he said there's something
[1:31:17] wrong with the way you're dressing
[1:31:19] that's men and women right that's right

[1:31:40] no I just myself that where go
[1:31:46] yep why can't we be there right amen but
[1:31:49] no listen if you don't get nothing the
[1:31:52] message today get one
[1:31:55] thing has something spoke to your heart
[1:31:59] yes right as an inward person a being a
[1:32:03] thought and an idea that is so real
[1:32:07] until it's more real than anything you
[1:32:09] physically can see with your
[1:32:11] eyes see that way you know this message
[1:32:14] is right that's right no matter with
[1:32:16] them what they try to tear down about
[1:32:18] brother Brown you know this message is
[1:32:20] Right y abs
[1:32:24] amen like brother dick says it wouldn't
[1:32:27] matter if they found out brother Brown
[1:32:28] was married 40
[1:32:29] times this message has led me to the
[1:32:33] Lord It's led me to
[1:32:37] Christ see then I know all them things
[1:32:39] is wrong they try to bring out that's
[1:32:41] right man that's
[1:32:44] right but you see church has anything
[1:32:47] ever spoken your
[1:32:50] heart
[1:32:52] so deep down in there that say nothing
[1:32:54] can take that out nothing can ever
[1:32:56] satisfy you what did the man say there
[1:32:58] in the script he said it's like fire
[1:33:01] shth in my bones that's right amen
[1:33:04] that's
[1:33:05] right like fire he said shut up in my
[1:33:08] bone that's
[1:33:11] right that's it something more real than
[1:33:13] my wife my kids my the church and the
[1:33:16] people of the world whatever something
[1:33:18] real
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:23] and just walk in that
[1:33:27] yes I've told you about in my own
[1:33:29] experience of seeing things even seeing
[1:33:31] angels and things in the
[1:33:33] house even seeing the Lord when I was
[1:33:35] about 11 years old but I put none of
[1:33:37] that as an
[1:33:39] experience none of that is my experience
[1:33:42] of the new birth
[1:33:48] no I have been able to as the lord gave
[1:33:51] me to speak sometimes words that
[1:33:53] literally have come to
[1:33:55] pass and seen it come to
[1:33:59] pass but I put none of that as my
[1:34:02] experience right absolutely cuz Paul
[1:34:06] said you can do all of these
[1:34:08] things now let me paraphrase that
[1:34:10] scripture just a
[1:34:12] second he says you can do all these
[1:34:15] things and have not an inward experience
[1:34:18] yep of something speaking within you
[1:34:21] that's right
[1:34:22] is that changing the scripture when it
[1:34:24] says you have not charity what's charity
[1:34:26] speaking of Charity is love almighty God
[1:34:30] there's only one charity there only one
[1:34:32] God
[1:34:34] right see the difference in the old and
[1:34:36] the New Testament those people back
[1:34:38] there God could speak to their heart and
[1:34:40] they done Mighty marvelous things
[1:34:42] because of that voice that was in their
[1:34:43] heart right but on the day of
[1:34:48] Pentecost from that time down it's been
[1:34:51] God in the heart of man
[1:34:53] right that's
[1:34:55] right when you receive that new
[1:34:59] birth and I believe it this way you must
[1:35:02] first hear the voice of God calling you
[1:35:06] to
[1:35:09] Salvation absolutely
[1:35:12] amen that's my way of saying right he
[1:35:16] must hear him speak to you y and call
[1:35:19] you
[1:35:20] y then he can given you birth to that
[1:35:23] that he's called you not all of these
[1:35:26] seeds everybody says you're born with
[1:35:28] inside of you you know this that of
[1:35:30] building
[1:35:33] yeah putting it all on one thing as God
[1:35:37] called
[1:35:40] you if he's called you then he can give
[1:35:42] you the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes
[1:35:44] the old test people couldn't get that
[1:35:46] that's right they could only get the
[1:35:49] call the leading and if they could do
[1:35:50] those mighty marvelous things right what
[1:35:54] should it be under the blood of Jesus
[1:35:55] Christ amen come on that's right Amen
[1:36:02] on he said well you spoke to these
[1:36:04] things but if you go back and listen to
[1:36:06] the message you'll hear some things that
[1:36:09] you hav't paid maybe much attention
[1:36:12] to cuz I believe in God speaking to your
[1:36:14] heart to calling
[1:36:16] you I don't believe in me calling
[1:36:19] you that's right
[1:36:22] I told you about when Wade came back
[1:36:24] you've heard the
[1:36:28] story and I had done told my wife that
