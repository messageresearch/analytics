[11:28] not just for Sal
[11:30] but for the message of the
[11:32] hour salvation is truly the most
[11:34] important thing but you got to get the
[11:36] message for your day or you miss it all
[11:40] you got to be into the message of the
[11:41] hour and we sure do appreciate the Lord
[11:44] giving us um some updated songwriters
[11:48] that writes about serpent seed and
[11:49] recognizing your day because nobody in
[11:51] any other age could do that they didn't
[11:55] know anything about
[11:56] it they knew Jesus Christ they knew he
[11:59] saved their soul they lived with God
[12:02] they did the best they could do and then
[12:04] they went on right but you and I have a
[12:07] commission we got to go further we got
[12:10] to grow amen so let's uh let's just
[12:14] realize that that's what our whole we're
[12:16] going to talk about a little bit today
[12:18] on growth uh you know the some of you I
[12:22] know brother Gary Atkins he uh he
[12:25] enjoyed my plum tree that I planted 20s
[12:27] something years ago and you know I was
[12:29] looking at the other day brother Donnie
[12:31] and and I thought well when I planted it
[12:33] in 2020 I mean
[12:36] 2002 that this thing had never grow we
[12:39] were going in a Rapture and you know all
[12:41] this was going to uh big vibrant tree
[12:44] you know comes out and brother George is
[12:46] just big old plums and people would come
[12:48] and eat them we made plum jelly people
[12:50] made plum jelly people come by eat till
[12:52] we was Plum full of
[12:54] plums but now that tree is
[12:56] dead he had a few branch anches this
[13:00] year but we're going to have to cut him
[13:03] down but he did what he supposed to
[13:06] do we enjoyed it we enjoyed the other
[13:10] ages we enjoyed even brother
[13:12] brandom but now they've gone on they've
[13:16] done their job it's left up to the bride
[13:19] in a many membered
[13:21] body to carry that
[13:23] on and and and produce that fruit again
[13:27] because the tree you look at it now you
[13:29] look at it 20 years ago and it was just
[13:30] beautiful I mean it had big old plums on
[13:33] it but you look at it now and it's it's
[13:35] just old and nothing on it but that's
[13:38] the cycle of Life yes that we come to
[13:41] that we all come to I was thinking about
[13:42] today this morning about us getting
[13:45] older and then I looked at and I saw
[13:46] that tree and I'm like well that's the
[13:49] cycle of the way it is but you know what
[13:51] I got another one planted and it's only
[13:53] about that big around so I hope I don't
[13:56] see that one 20 years brother John to
[13:58] make
[14:00] as we say in the South a mess of plums
[14:03] but um but we have the word of the Lord

[18:02] U we're going to get out of here we're

[18:07] for us to leave this place other Church
[18:10] ages they didn't have it that door was
[18:12] closed right that door was shut there
[18:15] was no way they could take a Rapture in
[18:17] in other Church ages but in this one
[18:20] there's an open door there's an open
[18:22] book Revelations 4 there was a door open
[18:25] in heaven well that door is open for me
[18:26] and you and that's where we're going
[18:27] we're going to be as brother Ernie vill
[18:29] Anda says we're going to be ejected
[18:32] we're elected to be ejected and uh boy I

[18:40] jumping around all over the sixth
[18:41] Dimension and and praising the Lord and
[18:44] we'll see him amen what a great comfort
[18:47] all these just went on that we've even
[18:49] here in our congregation that we'll get
[18:52] to see them amen that's not a hope
[18:55] that's assurity that that will happen so
[18:58] let's let's bow our heads and get
[18:59] started dear heavenly father thank you

[19:03] for the brothers and sisters that's

[19:34] against you Lord cleanse us Lord you
[19:36] speak today be the active participant in
[19:39] this service father we ask these things
[19:41] in Jesus name amen so we're here we're
[19:44] on the son of man and we kind of covered
[19:47] it a little bit last night we had like I
[19:49] said we had a really good time with the
[19:51] Hispanic brothers and sisters down there
[19:53] in uh in Lawrenceville and U and we
[19:56] enjoyed being with them and
[19:59] but there's something we've got to do
[20:01] that no other age was required this is a
[20:04] requirement just like adoption is a
[20:06] requirement it's predetermined
[20:08] predestined that we come to adoption so
[20:10] it's also predestined that we take a
[20:12] body change and a Rapture all right this
[20:15] is the end of all things everything's
[20:16] come to this end all right that we
[20:18] believe that all right well then we need
[20:21] to start acting like it we need to quit
[20:22] acting like that me included qu acting
[20:25] like that I'm going to read you
[20:26] something in a few minutes we actually
[20:29] hinder the Holy
[20:32] Spirit H well some of you don't then
[20:34] that's you pray for us to do but we
[20:36] hinder the Holy Spirit the whole down
[20:39] through the church ages the Holy Spirit
[20:41] was hindered it couldn't work completely
[20:43] like it did even Jesus would stand in a
[20:46] place and he was not didn't have the
[20:48] Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost and he
[20:50] would have to do what he had to get rid
[20:52] of a group of people because of their
[20:54] unbelief cuz he couldn't work under that
[20:57] unbelief same way with us the same way
[20:59] with brother randam he said look if you
[21:01] got unbelief don't come up here you got
[21:03] to come believing cuz that will hinder
[21:06] the spirit it'll hinder the church
[21:07] service it'll hinder a lot of things if
[21:09] we don't have faith to believe that
[21:10] we're going to get something from God
[21:12] today so in the beginning was the word
[21:15] word was with God and Word was God and
[21:16] that word was made flesh and dwelt among
[21:18] us and we beheld his glory the glory of
[21:20] the only begotten of the father full of
[21:22] grace and truth John
[21:25] 16 Jesus is telling us when he the
[21:29] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[21:30] you into all truth now that's a
[21:33] promise that's a promise that he would
[21:35] lead you and guide you into all truth
[21:36] but now look if you're not looking for
[21:38] truth if truth is presented and you turn
[21:41] it down you have hindered your walk with
[21:44] God you've hindered your the Holy Ghost
[21:46] and he cannot work in your life I'm
[21:47] talking about ours and yours too I'm
[21:49] preaching to all of us today for you
[21:52] shall not speak of himself in other
[21:53] words all that's being now transferred
[21:55] to the bride and who's getting
[21:56] Revelation God's not getting re
[21:58] Revelation brother R told us in the
[21:59] church book God don't get Revelation and
[22:02] never has got Revelation he is the
[22:04] Revelation but he's sending it down to
[22:06] me and you all right so and he will show
[22:08] you things to come or give you further
[22:11] Revelation you may be
[22:13] seated we got to continue
[22:16] on you must be born again because if
[22:18] you're not born again we can't even talk
[22:20] about the things that we're going to
[22:22] talk about and now as we talk about the
[22:25] move and the work of God that we see in
[22:27] in the church and in the different ones
[22:29] that the statue of perfect man is
[22:31] beginning to work we're beginning to see
[22:33] that people are are being able to get
[22:36] more from God to to be more mature and
[22:39] not be crybabies all the time and not be
[22:41] you're always going to have them but but
[22:43] still there's got to be a maturity in a
[22:45] group of people that has to come to
[22:48] Perfection that we don't have to look
[22:51] for it it's
[22:52] here we don't have to go looking for it
[22:55] it's here I don't mean in this building
[22:56] physically I mean in the word of God
[22:59] right all right as long as a word of God
[23:00] is preached that's where you're supposed
[23:02] to be all right cuz that's what we feed
[23:04] on we don't feed on false Doctrine see
[23:08] listen you and it's hard to tell you
[23:10] this but but in Luther's day I've been
[23:12] reading about Martin Luther and John
[23:13] Wesley about their life cuz we're going
[23:15] to do a little bit with the church ages
[23:16] as we get on up to the
[23:18] headstone cuz that was a headstone to
[23:20] the church and the church was Paul
[23:22] arenus Martin Columba all the way up
[23:24] Luther Wesley so I've been reading about
[23:26] Luther and Wesley and you see their
[23:28] lives and you need as brother R always
[23:30] says and the Bible tells us that that
[23:32] they were all they all could come part
[23:35] of the way out of their denomination but
[23:37] couldn't get all the way out right they
[23:39] couldn't get everything in other words
[23:41] the congregation would sit and listen to
[23:42] John Wesley preach about a trinitarian
[23:45] Doctrine well now the Holy Ghost Inside
[23:47] of them wasn't feeding on that that's
[23:49] right he can't feed on false doctr but
[23:53] God let that happen he let he winked it
[23:55] to ignorance of that part and then John
[23:58] Wesley brought sanctification so the
[24:00] life would be there instead of being
[24:03] with Martin Luther where he could drink
[24:05] beer and smoke a pipe and and you know
[24:07] he was a
[24:08] German we say that and we think well
[24:11] that's no that's just everyday life for
[24:12] Germans you know but he didn't have
[24:14] enough to get him all the way out he had
[24:16] enough to get him out of Catholicism but
[24:18] he brought some of that Catholicism with
[24:20] him and also in the denominational World
[24:23] they couldn't get all the way out they
[24:25] leaned back to the
[24:26] mother come on they lean back to the
[24:29] mother they believe the same thing
[24:31] Catholic churches in trinitarian
[24:34] Doctrine false baptism in the name of
[24:36] Father Son and Holy Ghost they believe
[24:38] that every denomination except for a few
[24:40] us and different ones I don't call us a
[24:42] denomination but there are some
[24:43] denominations that are Oneness and
[24:44] different ones that baptize in Jesus
[24:46] name but most people have took a piece
[24:49] of that mother and brought it with
[24:51] them I'm
[24:53] sorry
[24:54] right and if we don't have the truth so
[24:58] do we cuz Satan has moved he's not
[25:02] stayed back there he's moved right into
[25:04] this
[25:05] message right that's where he wants to
[25:08] be that's where he can do the most
[25:09] damage that's why brother Ram said oh if
[25:11] Satan could know this seal this seventh
[25:13] seal he could do a lot of damage well
[25:16] you keep it bottled up inside of you he
[25:18] won't get
[25:21] it the seventh seal is you and me folks
[25:24] it's it's Christ revealed in a bride and
[25:27] the Secrets he tells us there's things
[25:29] junee and I talk about and I know you do
[25:31] too you can laugh or roll your eyes if
[25:32] you want to there's things I tell June
[25:34] June and I talk about that would
[25:35] probably make y'all
[25:37] sick but it's me and her we understand
[25:41] each other why can't we be that same way
[25:43] in the gospel where that our husband
[25:45] we'll read this maybe I think tonight
[25:47] we'll talk about a little bit about the
[25:49] the bride being the fullness of the
[25:50] godhead bodily that's because she's
[25:53] mature cuz they couldn't be the fullness
[25:55] of the godhead bily back in the church
[25:56] ages all right right even in this age in
[25:59] the layout of seean age we see it
[26:01] happening the same way so that way we've
[26:03] got to move on a little bit further all
[26:05] right and let God tell our he he's not
[26:07] going to tell a secret to everybody come
[26:10] on people like I said with me and you
[26:11] when there's certain things we say that
[26:13] that you'll never know that's right well
[26:15] now that's not being mean that's because
[26:17] she's my bride amen we married each
[26:19] other to be one to be able to talk about
[26:22] things now why do we marry Jesus Christ
[26:24] to be quiet and keep
[26:26] secrets huh
[26:29] no he's already told us everything we
[26:31] just got to do what he
[26:33] says so you're still what you are until
[26:35] you're born again of the spirit of God
[26:37] we were preaching last night on anointed
[26:39] for for the
[26:41] time and I believe that a lot of what we
[26:44] have maybe not so much yeah Church ages
[26:47] or the denominations and and also in the
[26:49] message we have people that are anointed
[26:52] but not born again cuz we see that
[26:55] people preach this message of the hour
[26:56] for 30 years I'm talking about preachers
[26:59] they spend their life yes their whole
[27:02] life 30 years preaching the message of
[27:03] the hour and then they say it's false
[27:05] because they find something little here
[27:07] and
[27:07] there they never got born again that's
[27:10] right they got an anointing of the hour
[27:12] they got an anointing of the message of
[27:14] the hour and felt good and was able to
[27:16] put things together
[27:18] intellectually well praise God we've not
[27:20] had that here we got a Ministry that's
[27:23] different from
[27:24] [Applause]
[27:26] that
[27:28] yeah cuz our pastor preached being born
[27:30] again 50 years ago and he hadn't
[27:34] stopped so joining church and changing
[27:37] your ideas or having good intentions
[27:39] that's good as it might be is still not
[27:41] right that's right the new birth is an
[27:43] experience in other words something that
[27:45] takes place June and I got married that
[27:48] was something that took place all right
[27:50] we were both there we had an experience
[27:53] of getting married have you ever had an
[27:55] experience with getting married to Jesus
[27:57] Jesus Christ that's my question to
[27:59] you and that brings the new
[28:02] birth we look in the first seal brother
[28:05] Brown then he separates us from the
[28:08] church he takes the church he talks
[28:09] about church church he said I'm going to
[28:11] call you bride now listen that you'll
[28:14] understand yes right cuz that probably
[28:18] probably was a new name to a lot of
[28:20] denominations that he was preaching to
[28:22] he' say the church because remember the
[28:26] church
[28:27] denominational Church preaches that we
[28:30] go through tribulation that we have to
[28:32] stand the white Throne judgment right
[28:36] that's false Doctrine that's right so
[28:38] brother random was preaching to him and
[28:39] he said look that's for the church yes
[28:42] the church goes through tribulation yes
[28:44] the church has to stand judgment but no
[28:47] the bride does not she's being separated
[28:50] she being judged
[28:52] now she's not going to the th white
[28:54] Throne judgment listen what a
[28:56] consolation that should be to every one
[28:58] of
[28:59] us because they're preach listen
[29:02] whatever you preach that's what you
[29:04] are they preach they're going to have to
[29:06] go through the tribulation so guess what
[29:08] they're going through the
[29:10] tribulation they preach they're going to
[29:12] stand before the white Throne judgment
[29:13] brother George they're going to stand
[29:15] before the white Throne judgment if
[29:16] they're not born again every person
[29:18] that's not born again will have to stand
[29:19] before the white Throne judgment but
[29:21] praise God if you get born again here
[29:24] you won't have to worry about it there
[29:26] you've already been judged you've been
[29:27] judged by the
[29:31] judge so never since Jesus Christ on
[29:33] Earth was did Satan have such a
[29:35] formidable opponent he hates this
[29:36] message he hates it he doesn't hate it
[29:39] when it lays on paper brother John he
[29:41] hates it when it's lived he hates it
[29:44] when brothers and sisters get together
[29:46] and talk about the word of God and talk
[29:48] about Revelation and things that God's
[29:49] done in their life he hates that and you
[29:52] watch him every time you put something
[29:54] out there like brother Ram said he says
[29:57] now Secrets I keep in my heart he said
[30:00] but if I ever speak it Satan can get a
[30:01] hold of it and do harm with
[30:06] it think about that Colossians 1 ver8
[30:10] we're going to get to this and he is the
[30:12] head of the body now look he is the head
[30:14] of what the body the body is the bride
[30:18] the body is the seven Church ages of the
[30:21] of the Born Again Believers in every
[30:24] Church age plus us sitting here today is
[30:26] everybody with me that is the body of
[30:28] Christ he has no physical body here at
[30:31] the moment he does have a body it's over
[30:34] in another dimension all right so he
[30:36] sent the Holy Ghost back into this
[30:38] Dimension to go inside a a bunch of
[30:42] Believers so he can live his way out but
[30:45] he's still the head yes sir we're not
[30:48] the head that's why there had to be
[30:50] positions in the church positions in the
[30:53] in the home husband's the head of the
[30:55] household listen that's that wasn't that
[30:57] way until the
[31:01] fall Adam and Eve were the same person
[31:03] they were co-equal before the fall we
[31:06] always talk about Adam speaking the tree
[31:08] What About
[31:09] Eve before the fall Eve was the same
[31:11] thing as Adam was but because of the
[31:14] fall and what happened there had to be
[31:15] headship but you know what same thing
[31:17] with me and you we didn't come here
[31:19] bride that's right hello somebody we had
[31:23] to be born into that body out of this
[31:25] body into that body which is the body of
[31:28] Christ a many membered body as we're
[31:30] going to talk about this
[31:31] afternoon the collective body of Jesus
[31:34] Christ is the fullness now why was Jesus
[31:36] the fullness of the godhead bodily I'll
[31:38] Point give you this a little bit why was
[31:40] he the fullness of the godhead
[31:42] bodily when he was born when he was born
[31:45] a
[31:46] baby he didn't need the Holy Ghost amen
[31:50] he he was the Holy Ghost he just picked
[31:53] up a flesh body that was created by a
[31:56] what not not a man and a woman but by
[31:59] God spoken word all right placed in the
[32:01] womb she was an oven or an incubator
[32:04] that brought the body of Christ out but
[32:05] when that body was when that baby was
[32:07] born when you breathed your first breath
[32:10] you were
[32:16] dead you're human your first breath you
[32:19] start going
[32:22] downhill now he was in body but his
[32:25] spirit and his soul was God yes that
[32:28] makes him the fullness of the godhead
[32:29] bodily he was all father all son and all
[32:32] holy ghost yes sir but you and I are not
[32:34] because of our first birth but when we
[32:37] get the new birth sir that puts us into
[32:40] that body yes sir that's why we can't be
[32:43] judged the body of Christ has already
[32:45] been judged right it was judged at
[32:47] Calvary sir so God looks at that and he
[32:49] says hey that's his body it's already
[32:52] been
[32:53] judged so he's the head of the body of
[32:55] the church who is the beginning the
[32:56] first firstborn from the dead that in
[32:59] all things that he might have the
[33:01] preeminence there wasn't a time when
[33:02] Jesus Christ was lost there go now
[33:06] listen he grew in Grace and
[33:08] knowledge and favor with man that's what
[33:10] the Bible says because of his Humanity
[33:13] all right he didn't come out of the womb
[33:15] preaching okay but he was but he was not
[33:18] born again either he didn't need a new
[33:20] birth he was born right the first time
[33:23] you and I need a new birth cuz we born
[33:24] in sin shaping in iniquity we came to
[33:26] this world this way but the reason he
[33:28] came was to clean that thing out say hey
[33:31] I'm human you're human we're join ARS
[33:34] right we're join a with Christ that
[33:36] means his flesh we flesh that's why mzc
[33:39] couldn't be your savior now inside of
[33:43] MDC was your savior absolutely but MDC
[33:46] couldn't save you he was
[33:49] just spoken into existence God stepped
[33:52] in the body stepped back out and that
[33:54] thing just went down to dust that's not
[33:57] the way you and I came so we had to be
[33:59] he had to be born the same way we are
[34:01] except for the Virgin birth all right is
[34:03] everybody with me but we're the body
[34:06] then the body's already been judged so
[34:08] everything he's got though we get yes I
[34:11] want us to realize that amen for it
[34:13] pleased the father that in him should
[34:15] all fullness dwell amen he was the
[34:19] fullness of the godhead bodily he was
[34:21] father Son and Holy Ghost brother Brown
[34:23] says complete yes full he now listen he
[34:29] had some bad days as a human I'm
[34:31] sure and as a little boy he might have
[34:33] got
[34:35] spanked he grew in Grace and
[34:38] knowledge right but inside of that the
[34:43] soul was the soul of
[34:45] God the spirit was the spirit of God not
[34:48] another Spirit if he got another Spirit
[34:51] then we got to find that
[34:52] man uh-uh he had the spirit of God the
[34:55] soul of God that's what made him the B
[34:57] of the godhead bodily now listen your
[34:59] spirit realm is not God right now we're
[35:02] working toward it that's why brother Ram
[35:04] say she will be the fullness of the
[35:06] godhead body in a collective around the
[35:09] world group of people not one person
[35:13] brother Ron was not the fullness of the
[35:14] godhead bodily in one person but he
[35:18] could tell us that we are in a
[35:20] collective body all right that by with
[35:23] me Matthew 21 vers verse 42 we'll get to
[35:26] this a little bit later
[35:28] Jesus said did you never read in the
[35:30] scripture the stone which the builders
[35:32] rejected the same has become the head of
[35:36] the corner we know for sure that Jesus
[35:38] knew he would be
[35:40] rejected despised rejected Isaiah 53
[35:45] right
[35:47] 52 right right but he knew he would come
[35:50] back as the Cornerstone the one down
[35:52] there at the bottom to start his church
[35:55] the way he wanted it started right he
[35:58] couldn't get the he couldn't get a bride
[35:59] in the Old
[36:02] Testament bride had to be born by the
[36:05] spirit of God right spirit of God was
[36:07] not there to be born there was an
[36:08] anointing and it was the anointing of
[36:10] God so much that Moses face would shine
[36:13] they'd have to put a cover over it
[36:15] that's how much God thought of Moses he
[36:17] used a I'm sorry but he used an old
[36:20] man to destroy a nation I mean he
[36:23] literally would went to the White House
[36:26] and said let my people go and when they
[36:29] got finished that whole country all 50
[36:31] states that we got would be destitute
[36:34] that's right right and they said get out
[36:37] of here that's what happened under the
[36:40] blood of bulls and goats what about now
[36:43] but see me and you are not required to
[36:45] bring a natural group of
[36:49] people cuz we still live in the world
[36:51] this this thing still lives in the world
[36:53] but God told us to separate and come out
[36:55] of right Redemption out of and into all
[36:59] right out of this land into a new land
[37:02] yes sir who took him over though Moses
[37:05] didn't take him
[37:06] over Joshua took him over Moses thy
[37:10] servant is
[37:11] dead but he said Joshua the same as I
[37:14] was with Moses I'll be with you but you
[37:17] have another commission Moses had a
[37:20] commission to bring them out that's
[37:21] right Joshua had a commission to take
[37:23] them into the promised land and
[37:25] positionally place them where they
[37:27] needed to go they listen they that's why
[37:30] God has an order I'm a little bit off
[37:32] the subject here but God's got an order
[37:35] he didn't say okay afim you just
[37:37] wherever y'all you know every how many
[37:38] 25,000 of y'all you just go find you a
[37:41] place and it have been 25,000 people it
[37:44] been like the go Rush going out into
[37:45] California just everybody went now
[37:48] there's a purpose behind God setting
[37:50] every one of those remember brother R
[37:52] said even the mothers that call their
[37:54] name positionally plac them were they're
[37:56] supposed to go in that promised land
[37:59] before they even got
[38:02] there the calling of the name put
[38:05] Ephraim into this and and manasse into
[38:07] this and different ones we know that two
[38:09] tribes and a half trib stayed outside
[38:11] because of to type justification
[38:13] sanctification baptism and the Holy
[38:14] Ghost but there is a group that went
[38:16] in there's a group that went in this is
[38:19] a group that's going in all right we're
[38:21] not going to stay outside we're going in
[38:25] am amen by I love it because Moses told
[38:27] him or Joshua said hey it's okay y'all
[38:30] can have these this land out here but if
[38:33] there's any trouble in this land you're
[38:35] not going to stay out here and go that's
[38:37] your problem no they had to take up arms
[38:39] and go fight that's right that's why
[38:41] your justification sanctification
[38:43] baptism Holy Ghost never leaves you that
[38:45] is your fighting force against the devil
[38:48] yes
[38:49] sir praise God that is it that's your
[38:51] fighting
[38:52] force know that you're Justified know
[38:55] that God Justified you not justified
[38:57] yourself come on God Justified you God
[39:01] Sanctified you God filled you with the
[39:03] Holy Ghost those who is Justified he's
[39:05] already glorified when we going to start
[39:06] believing these things
[39:08] amen so the stone which the builders
[39:11] rejected now who's the builders the
[39:13] builders was the Old Testament God was
[39:16] supposed to be
[39:18] built by
[39:22] caias and the different ones cuz he was
[39:25] going to build his body through his
[39:26] church
[39:27] brother brandham said and I believe it
[39:30] and I read it where every one of those
[39:32] Old Testament prophets in that peace
[39:34] built the body of Jesus Christ and he
[39:36] just stepped out on what
[39:40] those
[39:43] denominations said he was coming to
[39:45] them
[39:47] amen he came to his own and his own
[39:50] received him not but those that did
[39:51] receive him he made them to be the Sons
[39:53] and Daughters of
[39:55] Goden
[39:56] so they rejected
[39:59] him but he didn't stop and say well I'm
[40:02] sorry I'm done I'm God but I can't do
[40:04] anything about this no God's going to
[40:06] have a group of
[40:07] people God's got a plan we got to get in
[40:10] the plan we got to be part of the plan
[40:12] and we got to help him we ain't got to
[40:13] help him like we talk about help but he
[40:16] did say he wanted to use your hands your
[40:18] mouth your heart
[40:19] absolutely your
[40:22] voice so the same has become the head of
[40:24] the corner so so so in other words
[40:27] you've knocked me off the
[40:31] top so I'm just going to start down to
[40:33] bottom in a little in a
[40:37] little
[40:38] headstone a
[40:40] corner and I'm going to build my
[40:44] church therefore I say unto you the
[40:46] kingdom of God shall be taken from you
[40:47] that's what he's looking at he's talking
[40:49] to the Pharisees he's talking to the
[40:50] Jews of the day he's saying this is
[40:53] going to be taken away from you and give
[40:56] to a nation remember Jews was a one
[40:59] nation but you and I were a collective
[41:01] group of Nations because we were
[41:03] Gentiles all right and they're going to
[41:06] bring forth the fruit thereof in other
[41:07] words they're going to produce what
[41:08] Jesus was saying I was telling them last
[41:10] night every sermon even this message of
[41:12] the hour came from a three and a half
[41:15] year message of Jesus Christ that's
[41:17] three and a half years three and a half
[41:19] years to go by just like that it has
[41:21] already right but he preached for three
[41:23] and a half years sister Su and that's it
[41:25] I mean did Paul get his message Jesus
[41:28] Christ where Iranians get his message
[41:30] Jesus Christ even where did the
[41:32] Catholics get their message Jesus Christ
[41:34] even the denominations where they get
[41:36] the message well they talk about a man
[41:37] named Jesus but they talk about him back
[41:39] there and he did this and he did that
[41:41] back there they don't have an
[41:43] everpresent God
[41:46] right and whosoever shall fall on this
[41:49] Stone shall be broken but whomsoever it
[41:51] shall fall it will grind I want God to
[41:53] grind me to
[41:54] powder amen gu me the powder Lord cuz
[41:58] he's a master builder he can start with
[42:00] that powder and he can make a mighty
[42:02] powerful church and that's what he's
[42:03] doing now brother R tells us there's
[42:05] been churches churches Brides brides
[42:07] churches Brides brides but there's got
[42:09] to come one Hallelujah there has to come
[42:11] a real bride now that doesn't mean I'm
[42:13] going to read this I think I got it a
[42:15] little bit
[42:16] later the the Bible talks about a
[42:18] faithful and true witness now not that
[42:20] that witness was ever
[42:22] false all right so he's not brother R's
[42:24] not saying that all the the brides were
[42:27] false cuz he says right here there has
[42:30] to come a real bride no a real bride
[42:32] that has a commission that real bride
[42:35] that's going to take the end time
[42:36] message and go to the body chains and go
[42:38] to the Rapture and bring all the other
[42:40] ones out of the Grave that's the real
[42:42] bride and listen that's what God's been
[42:45] looking for yes Revelations 3:14 the
[42:48] beginning of the creation of God that's
[42:49] you and me we know it was Jesus Christ
[42:51] but who are we we're M Jesus Christ and
[42:56] what must come one has got mechanics and
[42:58] Dynamics makes the church live move in
[43:00] the power of his resurrection until we
[43:02] come to that place why is it good to
[43:05] polish the hubs why is it good to wear
[43:07] long hair and long dresses if you don't
[43:09] live if you don't live it all the time
[43:11] and it become a revelation to you not
[43:13] that you just do it because somebody
[43:14] says hallu it becomes a revelation Jun
[43:17] doesn't have to get up every morning and
[43:18] fight herself to go get her hair
[43:20] cut if you're born again a holy ghost
[43:23] filled woman won't ever cut her hair
[43:31] right Revelations
[43:34] 19:5 let us be glad and rejoice and give
[43:36] honor to him for the marriage of the
[43:37] Lamb has come and his wife has made
[43:40] herself ready and to her was Grant look
[43:43] to her was granted from who her husband
[43:46] the
[43:48] head that she should be a
[43:51] raid and fine
[43:53] linen in other words no piece
[43:57] uncovered AR raid and fine linen and
[43:59] you're not going to walk up and be clean
[44:00] and white and have one little spot right
[44:02] here or a little spot right here or
[44:05] little spot down here God's not that
[44:08] way you might be that way and I might be
[44:10] that way but when God cleans you up he
[44:14] don't leave a spot he don't leave a
[44:16] wrinkle you know what the Bible says
[44:19] without spot or wrinkle when we going
[44:20] start believing that we shall be ar raay
[44:23] and fine linen clean and white for the
[44:25] fine linen is the righteousness of his
[44:30] body we're the
[44:32] Saints all right remember we were
[44:35] talking about this the the your bride is
[44:37] on your wedding day I'm going to get
[44:38] married this is my bride or this is my
[44:40] new
[44:42] bride but she should become your wife
[44:45] this is my
[44:47] wife June Dale this is my wife she was
[44:50] my bride on wedding day she was my bride
[44:52] maybe my Young Bride in the
[44:54] beginning and you might want to call her
[44:56] bride that's okay but she knows she's
[44:58] your bride she was there at the
[45:01] wedding all right I
[45:04] hope but now she's your wife she
[45:08] understands you look now what is a wife
[45:11] to do a wife is to what Express the
[45:14] husband aren't we supposed to express
[45:17] the Lord
[45:18] Jesus that's all listen the bride's not
[45:21] to be somebody that's over here that
[45:23] does their own thing no like the world
[45:25] does and becomes the head and becomes
[45:28] the this and that and the other
[45:29] everybody understand me remember this is
[45:32] a woman's Nation this is a woman's
[45:33] everything coming to a woman a woman is
[45:35] what's killing all of the the
[45:41] world the Greek lexican says look a wife
[45:44] is come to
[45:46] pass be
[45:47] done arise be
[45:51] fulfilled remember brother R talked
[45:53] about an unfulfilled age well that
[45:54] wasn't the right bride it wasn't the
[45:56] true bride it was a bride but it wasn't
[45:58] all true because they had false Doctrine
[46:01] be married to or look be
[46:04] preferred why were you not born in
[46:08] another
[46:09] age why were you you that have the Holy
[46:11] Ghost why weren't you born some other
[46:13] time cuz God controls every bit of
[46:17] that there's no one person that says I
[46:20] got here because I wanted to and I I was
[46:22] born January 26
[46:24] 1960
[46:28] no by the way betting ground brother R
[46:31] said he took this one to this one and
[46:33] married this one this one and this one
[46:34] this one and got you here so you can
[46:37] make a choice but he knew once you once
[46:38] you got here what you do yes sir we just
[46:41] don't but brother George he put us in
[46:43] this age he didn't put us in Martin
[46:45] Luther's day he didn't put us in John
[46:47] Wesley listen he didn't put us here in
[46:48] the 50s some of you might have been born
[46:50] in in
[46:53] in 40s but he put you here to do
[46:56] something today yes sir today is the day
[46:59] of salvation we love the day we got
[47:02] married the day we he said you're my
[47:05] bride the boat board came
[47:08] up and took the
[47:11] bride but he didn't take her and leave
[47:13] her and and go off he took her back to
[47:18] Chicago he took us on a
[47:23] journey listen here just a minute I want
[47:25] to kind of reject
[47:27] this the Bible tells us that that God
[47:30] gave us a help meat brother Dale has
[47:32] preached on this many many times he
[47:34] didn't give us a help mate read your
[47:36] Bible if you got your Bible read it does
[47:38] not say help mate it says a help
[47:42] meat which is the same somebody to help
[47:47] you or enhance you not make you worse or
[47:54] weak God didn't have a bride to make him
[47:57] weak he had a bride to become a wife to
[48:00] make him
[48:01] strong and be the opponent of the devil
[48:04] that he's always looked
[48:06] for yes Satan says I did it through a
[48:09] woman God says I'm going to do it
[48:10] through one
[48:13] too we're all feminist in the body
[48:16] right sat said oh I got herur she's weak
[48:18] he said no you may have got her but that
[48:21] second Eve she ain't going to fall I'm
[48:23] going to use that same character
[48:26] yes the
[48:28] woman so it's a help me or as join HS in
[48:32] Romans 8 tells us we're join HS with
[48:34] Jesus Christ I hope you see
[48:38] that I got this off the internet it must
[48:40] be true sounded good anyway when you
[48:43] grow old who will take care of you for
[48:46] many that caretaker will be a spouse I'm
[48:49] getting to something here because look
[48:51] even the even the com even people tell
[48:53] us I'll read it here that marriage is
[48:56] one of the most important things you
[48:59] do do you know if you stay single
[49:02] according to the all the Lord we got so
[49:05] much um uh information now they can tell
[49:09] you how many this and how many of that
[49:10] and put it on a graph and put it on the
[49:12] chart and pull it up on the internet if
[49:15] you don't get married until you're like
[49:17] 35 or 40 you have a five year less life
[49:22] expectancy than ones that get married
[49:26] and Men we go
[49:30] first I'll read
[49:33] it but can't you see it
[49:36] yourself but does marriage actually
[49:39] improve life
[49:41] expectancy here's what the research
[49:44] shows marriage was one of the first
[49:47] nonbiological factors now a biological
[49:50] factor would mean that you have a heart
[49:52] issue or you have diabetes or you have
[49:54] some some some something that will cut
[49:56] your life short so this is nonbiological
[50:00] this is has nothing to do with your
[50:04] health marriage was one of the first
[50:07] non-biological factors identified as
[50:09] improving life expectancy I say praise
[50:13] God if you're married to Christ your
[50:16] life expectancy just went way
[50:19] up amen the explanation given was that
[50:22] married people tend to take fewer risk
[50:24] with their
[50:26] health and have better mental and
[50:28] emotional health sometimes we think
[50:30] that's the opposite I'm not preaching on
[50:33] marriage today but got to talk about a
[50:35] little
[50:35] bit marriage also provides more social
[50:39] and material support now think of think
[50:41] in the spiritual what Jesus Christ gives
[50:43] us in support if you're the
[50:45] bride
[50:47] amen y'all ought to sleep late on
[50:50] Saturday night you're not stay out so
[50:52] much you falling asleep
[50:54] already well you wouldn't fall asleep
[50:56] for as a ball game going on marriage
[50:59] also provides more social and material
[51:01] support look which means having someone
[51:03] to take care take you to the doctor the
[51:06] great physician or care for you when
[51:08] you're
[51:09] sick it can save your
[51:13] life married people live longer and
[51:15] healthier lives the power of marriage is
[51:19] particularly evident in late middle age
[51:23] well praise God that got a lot of us
[51:26] I think June and I are in the late part
[51:28] of the middle age that's what he says
[51:30] the late part the power of marriage is
[51:33] particularly evident in late middle age
[51:36] when Linda we and a colleague for
[51:37] example analyzed mortality differentials
[51:40] in a very I want you to think spiritual
[51:42] with me too now this is what Jesus
[51:44] Christ has married us to do for us to
[51:46] enhance us not to not to beat us make us
[51:50] doormats hello somebody
[51:53] amen thank God he doesn't do
[51:56] that a very large nationally
[51:58] representative sample they found an
[52:01] astonishingly large marriage Gap in
[52:05] longevity nine out of 10 married guys
[52:07] now listen to this guys nine out of 10
[52:11] married guys who are alive at
[52:13] 48 will make it to age
[52:16] 65
[52:18] 90% nine out of 10 of you married guys
[52:22] I'm heading toward that I won't be I'll
[52:24] be there in just year and a half or year
[52:25] and two months oh 64 coming up but if
[52:29] you're alive at 48 if you made it to 48
[52:33] then you got a 90% chance of making it
[52:36] to
[52:37] 65 compared to just six and 10 you say
[52:40] that ain't much yeah it is when he
[52:42] talking about me and you when you talk
[52:43] about our life
[52:45] okay just six and 10 comparable single
[52:49] guys controlling for race education
[52:51] income for women the protective benefit
[52:54] of marriage are also powerful though not
[52:57] quite as large nine out of 10 wives
[52:59] alive at 48 will live to be senior
[53:03] citizens compared with just eight out of
[53:05] 10 divorced and single women in fact
[53:08] according to statistic statistician
[53:11] Bernard Cohen and iing
[53:13] Lee I sing Lee maybe I don't know that's
[53:16] maybe an acronym who compiled a catalog
[53:19] of relative mortality risk look being
[53:21] unmarried is one of the greatest risks
[53:24] that people voluntarily
[53:25] subject himself
[53:28] to being unmarried is one of the great
[53:32] now iing Lee said this being unmarried
[53:35] is one of the greatest risk that people
[53:38] voluntarily subject themselves to having
[53:41] heart disease for example reduces a
[53:42] man's life expectancy by just under six
[53:45] years while being unmarried chops 10
[53:48] years off your
[53:50] life H this is not just a selection
[53:54] effect even controlling for initial
[53:56] health status sick people who are
[53:58] married live longer than their unmarried
[54:01] counterpart I hope you think a little
[54:03] bit spiritual L right having a spouse
[54:06] for example example lowers a cancer
[54:08] patient risk of dying from the disease
[54:10] as much as being in an age category 10
[54:13] years
[54:15] younger a recent study of outcomes for
[54:17] surgical patients found that just being
[54:20] married lowered a patient's risk of
[54:23] dying in a hospital
[54:27] praise
[54:28] God scientists who have studied immune
[54:32] functioning in the laboratory find that
[54:35] happily married couples have better
[54:38] functioning immune systems praise God I
[54:41] believe that cuz we believe in prayer
[54:42] and we believe in faith from our
[54:45] husband divorced people even years after
[54:49] the divorce show much lower levels of
[54:51] immune functions I just thought you
[54:53] might want to read that
[54:55] that's what God did for us when you
[54:56] marry Christ it's not just a marriage
[54:58] and you go well no there's things
[55:00] there's
[55:01] benefits and I know there's benefits to
[55:03] being married
[55:05] naturally but we're talking spiritually
[55:07] here yes cuz listen all you the Single
[55:10] Wives and single men and all people are
[55:12] not married that's not we're not kicking
[55:13] you out because Christ is your husband
[55:16] until you get one on earth Christ is
[55:18] your husband and and vice versa cuz he
[55:20] is our husband I don't care we're all
[55:22] feminist in the body of Christ that's
[55:23] why I said we all come under that
[55:25] feminist part but God's going to use
[55:28] that feminist part to defeat the Devil
[55:29] with sir Hebrews 4:12 for the word of
[55:33] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[55:35] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[55:36] to the dividing of sun of Soul and
[55:38] Spirit and the join marrow and the
[55:40] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[55:43] the heart and we we pulled apart the
[55:44] other day the soul that's the real you
[55:47] that's the person that you are that's
[55:48] the person that's going to stand before
[55:49] the white Throne judgment if you're not
[55:51] judged here because remember if your
[55:53] soul is born again that soul is God
[55:55] that's right and God can't be judged
[55:58] right he is the judge that's why that
[56:01] he's given us the part of being a judge
[56:05] cuz we can judge we're not you listen
[56:07] you're not even supposed to take a
[56:08] brother to court you're supposed to
[56:09] judge it right
[56:12] here well get quiet if you want to but
[56:14] that's what he
[56:15] said and you can also save on some real
[56:18] big lawyer fees right Bob Bob said yep
[56:23] it's an exorbitant amount of money
[56:25] people spend on law just having lawyers
[56:29] our little city of Gillsville population
[56:31] 300 when the cows are on this side of
[56:33] the
[56:34] fence we pay our lawyer $110,000 a year
[56:40] just as a
[56:41] retainer now we get a few little thing
[56:44] you know that gives us so many minutes
[56:45] on the phone and he comes to a meet in
[56:46] the year and we get this and then it
[56:49] becomes billable
[56:50] hours so when you talk to them on the
[56:53] phone you better get say don't say hey
[56:54] how you doing David no it's like hey I
[56:57] need this right here okay you give me
[56:59] answer see you bye cuz it's $300 an hour
[57:03] after
[57:04] that so woe unto you
[57:08] lawyers that's telling you what Jesus
[57:11] said that's what he
[57:14] said not people that work for
[57:18] him but I know Bob sees a lot of that it
[57:20] is it is a it's an odd um
[57:25] when you have to when you try to believe
[57:27] somebody that you know's guilty and you
[57:29] try to make them innocent and you know
[57:32] in your mind they
[57:34] guilty and you try
[57:36] to take them before a
[57:40] jury and convince them or at least one
[57:42] of them that it might not be that
[57:46] way I don't think I could live that way
[57:49] anyway so the spirit realm is the realm
[57:50] that we're talking about now this is the
[57:52] this is where the battlegr is this is to
[57:54] me this is the messy part because you
[57:56] know what a a birth is a mess but once
[57:57] you clean the baby up he pretty smelly
[58:00] good and all the all the baby oil and
[58:02] all the I you love baby shampoo I wish
[58:05] they' make something for me for that
[58:06] smell like baby shampoo I love that
[58:08] stuff and it don't get tears in your
[58:10] eyes I wonder why we don't have
[58:13] that well praise the Lord anyway life
[58:15] lesson number
[58:18] 743 but after you're cleaned
[58:21] up you're not a mess anymore you're your
[58:24] soul is clean just as Eternal as God is
[58:27] it's not just Eternal as God is it is
[58:30] God all right but our spirit realm is
[58:32] where the nasty smudy mire of the world
[58:35] and it's not on this guy right here this
[58:38] guy just produces what's inside he's
[58:40] just a vehicle to get Express what
[58:42] you've got like my hands Express what
[58:44] you got inside of you but my memory is
[58:47] not your memory my reasoning is not your
[58:49] reason I have my own all right but God
[58:52] said he would work on that through these
[58:54] virtues he would work on that part of
[58:58] you because your soul is already Eternal
[59:00] your soul is already sit in Heavenly
[59:01] places your soul is already God Almighty
[59:04] and coming to the fullness of the
[59:06] godhead body and the collective group
[59:08] yes all
[59:09] right but we've got to come to
[59:11] Perfection as we'll see here in just a
[59:13] few minutes the whole Bible talks about
[59:15] growth absolutely from Genesis to
[59:18] Revelation talks about
[59:20] growth Ephesians 1:4 says having
[59:23] predestinated us into the adoption of
[59:24] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[59:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[59:30] will so there's a group that's going to
[59:33] come to adoption that's going to come to
[59:35] birth going to come to adoption and
[59:36] we're going to take that adoption and
[59:38] use it as brother R says here in a few
[59:39] minutes where you won't pray for people
[59:42] you speak to
[59:45] people now listen lay it on them hands
[59:47] you can't take it out of the
[59:48] Bible some people need that I don't need
[59:53] that some people need that to feel that
[59:55] connection and that's fine and Dy
[59:57] because it's in the Bible you can't take
[59:59] it out but when are we going to come to
[1:00:01] where you say you say you say to your
[1:00:05] sickness you say to your wayward child
[1:00:07] or your wayward husband you say to them
[1:00:10] be
[1:00:11] moved and not down in your
[1:00:14] heart we are
[1:00:16] predestinated unto adoption so remember
[1:00:19] we talked about adoption is second Peter
[1:00:21] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:00:23] in other words if these things be in you
[1:00:25] and work they're going to make you where
[1:00:28] you're not Barren or unfruitful in the
[1:00:30] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:00:33] he that lath these things is blind even
[1:00:35] though you're a
[1:00:36] Christian even though you're born again
[1:00:38] cuz born again come up here in verse 1 2
[1:00:40] three and four having the divine nature
[1:00:43] of God listen you can have the divine
[1:00:45] nature of God and be blind
[1:00:48] right have you not been sitting there
[1:00:50] and thought one thing and all of a
[1:00:51] sudden a preacher say something you go
[1:00:53] man I didn't think that was that well
[1:00:54] you were blind to it ex we were blind
[1:00:58] rich and miserable and
[1:01:00] naked the whole problem is with the
[1:01:02] world they don't know it you and I know
[1:01:05] when we're blind cuz we seek Revelation
[1:01:07] Lord help me with that yes help me with
[1:01:11] this that Minister saying take a little
[1:01:14] note and study it you don't have to you
[1:01:16] can't take a note on the whole subject
[1:01:18] but something will strike your heart
[1:01:20] like I got a question about that write
[1:01:22] it down and go study it amen
[1:01:25] St it for
[1:01:27] yourself but he that lacketh these
[1:01:29] things is blind and cannot see a far off
[1:01:31] in other words can't see further
[1:01:32] Revelation and hath
[1:01:37] forgotten have we forgotten in all this
[1:01:39] long journey that we're have we
[1:01:42] forgotten what God's brought us through
[1:01:45] that he purged us from our old sins and
[1:01:47] we don't need to worry about them
[1:01:49] anymore hello somebody put them in the
[1:01:52] sea of God's forgetfulness he don't
[1:01:55] remember them but you do but you know
[1:01:56] what it's not you that did
[1:02:00] it you listen the holy ghost in your
[1:02:02] body the Holy Ghost inside of you never
[1:02:05] will sin that's
[1:02:07] right that's the Paradox or the Paradigm
[1:02:09] or whatever you want to call it you got
[1:02:11] something Eternal inside of you yet
[1:02:13] you're dying you got something Eternal
[1:02:15] inside of you yet you have questions yet
[1:02:18] you get sick that's what happened when
[1:02:20] the fall happened that's why it was so
[1:02:22] bad that God said hey I'm going to put a
[1:02:24] Vision I'm not going to even be able to
[1:02:25] look at you until I come and clean this
[1:02:29] thing up yes am then we can have
[1:02:32] fellowship and there still brother Brown
[1:02:34] said he hears your voice I was telling
[1:02:35] him last night you know I go hunting and
[1:02:38] and go to Philippines for three three
[1:02:40] weeks or so man you know when I come
[1:02:42] back I don't want to see brother
[1:02:46] collie who do you want to see you want
[1:02:48] to see your bride or your wife that's
[1:02:52] who you want to see right listen Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ has not literally put his eyes on
[1:02:58] the bride
[1:02:59] yet think about
[1:03:03] it he's not here in a corporate body so
[1:03:06] his physical eyes has never seen the
[1:03:07] bride amen but in spirit form he's seen
[1:03:10] every one of us yes sir think about that
[1:03:12] but you know
[1:03:14] what I can call June up we can talk and
[1:03:17] we can just
[1:03:18] smooch for for a few minutes on the
[1:03:21] phone you hang a phone up and you know
[1:03:22] what she ain't knowwhere to be found
[1:03:24] you're you're you're you're you know
[1:03:27] 3,000 miles over here in the Philippines
[1:03:30] but I want to get back home so we can
[1:03:33] face to face see each other talk to each
[1:03:35] other have communion together with each
[1:03:37] other well that's what Jesus Christ is
[1:03:39] he's waiting on us in that other di
[1:03:42] listen he was in that Dimension and
[1:03:44] brother Ram couldn't see him right
[1:03:47] people in the sixth Dimension are not
[1:03:48] even privileged to see that body
[1:03:51] yet right but he's transferred all that
[1:03:53] power to this body for the moment yes to
[1:03:57] defeat the Devil with this
[1:03:59] body and then bring his body in the
[1:04:02] Millennium down here on Earth but we go
[1:04:04] to a wedding supper when we take a body
[1:04:07] change we get a glorified body this body
[1:04:10] changed then we can meet him in the air
[1:04:14] then we can meet our lover we can meet
[1:04:16] our husband somebody that we know that
[1:04:19] we felt
[1:04:20] him we've seen his work we've seen his
[1:04:23] work in our life but you've never
[1:04:26] physically seen Jesus Christ but we're
[1:04:28] going to see him we're going to look
[1:04:31] Face to Face Paul said one time we're
[1:04:34] going to see that person that we know is
[1:04:36] inside of us by the Holy Ghost but he is
[1:04:40] a person yes he is someone we want to
[1:04:43] touch he is someone we want to hug I
[1:04:46] don't know about you but to me that's a
[1:04:47] love affair all right you can have
[1:04:50] longdistance relationships all you want
[1:04:52] to but that's not very fulfill
[1:04:55] will wherefore the rather Brethren give
[1:04:57] diligence to make your calling and
[1:04:58] election sure if if you do these things
[1:05:00] you shall never
[1:05:02] fall that's pretty
[1:05:05] powerful for so an entrance shall be
[1:05:07] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[1:05:09] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[1:05:10] Savior Jesus Christ in other words
[1:05:12] there's going to be a door open in the
[1:05:14] end time through a little Prophet that
[1:05:16] comes and tells they say hey let's talk
[1:05:19] about this y'all talked about the new
[1:05:21] birth for for seven Church ages or 20 th
[1:05:24] years but we're going to talk about this
[1:05:27] adoption which never was taken out Paul
[1:05:29] talks about it but never attained to
[1:05:32] it you got to attain to it in the end
[1:05:34] time we have been what predestinated to
[1:05:37] adoption all right for so an entrance
[1:05:40] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:05:42] in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:05:43] and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will
[1:05:46] not be negligent to put you always in
[1:05:48] remembrance this is
[1:05:50] Peter and I'm sorry but if you read this
[1:05:54] right here he must have preached this
[1:05:56] same sermon about 20 times maybe 30
[1:05:59] times wherefore I will not be negligent
[1:06:02] to put you always in remembrance of
[1:06:04] these things though you know
[1:06:05] them and be established in the present
[1:06:08] day truth he goes and visits the church
[1:06:10] and they're like he going to preach on
[1:06:12] them virtues
[1:06:13] again well he going to come back three
[1:06:15] months he going to pre we know pet we
[1:06:17] know Peter going to say something about
[1:06:18] their virtues all right but let's have
[1:06:22] we made it have we is it common is it so
[1:06:24] common that we we saw all ask brother
[1:06:26] waade he's reading the same scripture
[1:06:27] again and he's got 138 sermons on this
[1:06:29] one subject and had him got to the real
[1:06:32] subject of the son of
[1:06:38] man now we look where Jesus he's walked
[1:06:41] at he's about three years into his
[1:06:43] ministry he has about 6 months left of
[1:06:45] his life he goes up a mountain and he's
[1:06:49] covered and overshadowed with a cloud
[1:06:51] and a voice comes out of the cloud which
[1:06:52] said this is my beloved Son and whom I
[1:06:54] pleased to dwell hear ye him all right
[1:06:57] hear ye him now brother Brown's going to
[1:07:00] tell us in a few minutes hear ye them he
[1:07:04] didn't change the
[1:07:06] word cuz there was the bride inside of
[1:07:09] Jesus the whole time Jesus walked on the
[1:07:11] earth you and I were inside of
[1:07:14] him that's why we can understand Jesus
[1:07:17] Christ better than
[1:07:20] anybody cuz that piece of you was inside
[1:07:22] of of that man
[1:07:24] that eternal life that Genesis 126 man
[1:07:26] came right down and went ENT that in
[1:07:28] that
[1:07:30] baby and walked through
[1:07:34] life I know some of you may have been on
[1:07:36] the shores of Galilee I don't know my
[1:07:37] mom and dad were I think but if anybody
[1:07:39] ever been to Israel and walk the shores
[1:07:41] of Galilee you should have all raised
[1:07:43] your hand you're not getting
[1:07:46] it
[1:07:48] amen you were there where were you in
[1:07:51] his soul you were that part of him that
[1:07:54] was longing to get out so he could
[1:07:56] commune
[1:07:58] with he he didn't mind communing back
[1:08:01] before the foundation the world in his
[1:08:02] mind and all that you know that we talk
[1:08:04] about but he doesn't want that I you
[1:08:07] know when you talk about your wife you
[1:08:10] think M you got all these different
[1:08:11] things and your husband in your mind you
[1:08:12] know I want that to develop into a
[1:08:14] person so I can talk to them I want to
[1:08:17] have a relations with him I want to I
[1:08:18] want to be somebody I can you know like
[1:08:20] brother Brown said that boy said he
[1:08:21] wants god with skin on him I want god
[1:08:24] with scan on
[1:08:27] him then hear you him we talk about the
[1:08:30] son was adopted his name's good on the
[1:08:32] checkbook just as good as his daddy's
[1:08:33] now he didn't get the checkbook at first
[1:08:35] he did get a checkbook but it had
[1:08:36] Jesus's name written on it cuz he
[1:08:39] really don't trust you with his money
[1:08:43] yet just like you wouldn't with a fivey
[1:08:45] old or a sixy old or 10y old driving you
[1:08:47] home in your car
[1:08:49] today Sophia drive your Mom and Daddy
[1:08:51] home today okay
[1:08:54] that makes us all nervous and we a even
[1:08:56] going to be in the car with him well
[1:08:58] that's the way God is he's not nervous
[1:09:00] but he knows you can't handle certain
[1:09:01] things
[1:09:02] that's he knows that you'll mess up a
[1:09:06] situation he knew that remember he told
[1:09:08] Brother R he said you're messing up
[1:09:11] remember the angel told him you're
[1:09:12] messing up quit quit trying to explain
[1:09:15] everything oh boy you get quiet when you
[1:09:17] start talking about a prophet making a
[1:09:18] mistake sorry about that but it
[1:09:20] did so that's where God's trying to get
[1:09:22] his church just say the mountain be
[1:09:24] moved and it'll move Authority sons of
[1:09:26] God the whole creation groaning waiting
[1:09:28] Romans
[1:09:30] 8 waiting for a spot to where that the
[1:09:33] sickness will be arise and it will be
[1:09:35] that way the blind will receive their
[1:09:37] sight deaf and dumb we pray for them now
[1:09:41] but then you'll command it now how many
[1:09:43] believe brother R was a prophet we
[1:09:45] believe that is going to happen or are
[1:09:48] we just going to keep reading
[1:09:49] it didn't say these signs shall follow
[1:09:52] them that believe they shall pray for
[1:09:53] the SI sick it said they shall cast out
[1:09:56] devils not I will they will if you say
[1:10:00] this mountain not if I say if you say
[1:10:02] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:10:03] in your heart what we need is adoption
[1:10:06] Sons and Daughters needs adoption but
[1:10:09] how can the church look the Pentecostal
[1:10:11] Church the Methodist Baptist be adopted
[1:10:13] until they come to discipline we've got
[1:10:16] to be disciplined first you know what
[1:10:18] discipline is right it's a set of rules
[1:10:20] that you go by right we lovingly go by
[1:10:23] by the rules that God give us all right
[1:10:26] but there's a set of rules that you go
[1:10:28] by in discipline all right so let me
[1:10:31] give you an example we are disciplined
[1:10:33] Christians because we don't smoke or
[1:10:35] drink and we know not to do these things
[1:10:37] we know not to curse we know not to you
[1:10:40] know wear men's clothes we know that
[1:10:43] right okay we know that we are
[1:10:47] disciplined though by the word of God
[1:10:49] but now what about them out there he's
[1:10:51] talking about Methodist Baptist they go
[1:10:52] to church with pants on shorts on saw a
[1:10:54] guy the other day walk in church with a
[1:10:55] pair of shorts on
[1:10:58] disrespectful there's no discipline
[1:11:02] right they just don't care you tell them
[1:11:05] oh you ain't supposed to do these things
[1:11:06] well I ain't perfect you ain't perfect
[1:11:07] well see they don't care they don't take
[1:11:09] headship they don't take discipline they
[1:11:11] don't take no headship that's right so
[1:11:14] God could not trust this power with the
[1:11:17] church but I say he is going to trust it
[1:11:19] with the bride
[1:11:21] amen it's hard to tell what you would
[1:11:25] do what the Pentecostals do they shouted
[1:11:29] it brother Brown said they blew it out
[1:11:30] the whistle they just have all these
[1:11:32] great uh manifestations and speaking in
[1:11:34] tongues and and never even get the word
[1:11:36] out well the word's got to be first to
[1:11:38] begin with CU they don't have enough
[1:11:41] discipline to put the word
[1:11:44] first we should know and have discipline
[1:11:47] to know how to do these things all right
[1:11:50] so it's discipline and those dis
[1:11:52] discipline is what those virtues now
[1:11:55] let's look at this real quick and then
[1:11:56] we'll close right here didn't get very
[1:11:57] far but we'll get far A little bit this
[1:11:58] afternoon Isaiah 53:2 now the Bible
[1:12:02] tells us about growth and that's what
[1:12:04] adoption is adopting is purely growth
[1:12:08] it's growth development through the word
[1:12:10] of God not not eating pie or whatever we
[1:12:13] had for
[1:12:14] Thanksgiving look who is this he in
[1:12:17] Isaiah
[1:12:18] 53 it's Jesus Christ amen for he shall
[1:12:22] grow up
[1:12:24] before him as a tender plant as a root
[1:12:26] out of dry ground he hath no form or
[1:12:28] cess and when we shall see him there's
[1:12:30] no beauty that we should desire him
[1:12:32] Zechariah 6:12 and speak unto the Lord
[1:12:35] saying thus speaketh the Lord of host
[1:12:37] saying behold the man whose name is the
[1:12:39] branch now who is that Jesus Christ and
[1:12:42] he shall grow up out of his place and he
[1:12:46] shall
[1:12:49] build not with hammer and nails he shall
[1:12:52] build the temple Temple of the Lord
[1:12:56] Malachi 4:2 says but unto you that fear
[1:12:58] my name shall the son of righteousness
[1:13:01] arise with healing in his wings and you
[1:13:02] shall go forth and grow
[1:13:05] up as calves of the stall that's right
[1:13:08] before Malachi
[1:13:11] 45 Ephesians
[1:13:14] 4:14 that will henceforth be no more
[1:13:16] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:13:19] about with every wind of Doctrine by the
[1:13:21] slight of men and cunning crack whereby
[1:13:24] they lie and weight to deceive but
[1:13:26] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:13:30] into him in all things which is the head
[1:13:34] even Christ Romans 8:21 because the
[1:13:37] creature itself also shall be delivered
[1:13:39] from the bondage of corruption into the
[1:13:41] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[1:13:43] for we know that the whole creation
[1:13:45] granth and travaileth in pain together
[1:13:46] until now and not only they but
[1:13:50] ourselves which have the first fruits of
[1:13:52] the spirit
[1:13:53] even we ourselves grown within
[1:13:56] ourselves waiting for the adoption to Wi
[1:13:59] or to witness or to understand the
[1:14:03] Redemption of our body listen even the
[1:14:06] great Apostle Paul spoke of it he could
[1:14:08] see it in part but he couldn't see in
[1:14:11] his
[1:14:12] fullness but the Bible that he wrote 80%
[1:14:14] of the New Testament is where we're
[1:14:15] going to get all that out of you see he
[1:14:18] was blinded because you say blinded yes
[1:14:20] he was blinded to that truth because he
[1:14:22] didn't get the seals
[1:14:23] he didn't get the open door like we did
[1:14:26] come on I'm sorry some of you looking at
[1:14:27] like it did last night some of them look
[1:14:29] I told I said when you get that big old
[1:14:30] fur on in the front of your face like
[1:14:33] that that means you ain't understanding
[1:14:35] it or you don't believe it one of the
[1:14:36] two you
[1:14:38] go it was a brother sitting on the front
[1:14:40] row and I said something and
[1:14:45] he we express
[1:14:48] everything that we he we are
[1:14:50] inside you can't hide it
[1:14:57] we really don't need discernment like
[1:14:59] brother
[1:15:00] brandham that was for them has enough
[1:15:03] discernment looking at people's faces
[1:15:05] especially them that
[1:15:10] go wherefore the law was our school
[1:15:12] Master to bring us to Christ so there
[1:15:14] was a there was a law right the law of
[1:15:17] dos and don'ts even Jesus came under
[1:15:19] that law of dos and don'ts amen he would
[1:15:23] do something he say go do the law of
[1:15:25] Moses he' do something he'd say go see
[1:15:28] the priest cuz a leper remember a leper
[1:15:30] had to take his body to a priest and
[1:15:32] they had to check him over if there was
[1:15:33] no spots or it was yellow I mean white
[1:15:36] they were good well Jesus didn't say
[1:15:38] well bless God forget about them people
[1:15:39] no he grew up under the law you and I
[1:15:43] when we're born again and we are the
[1:15:45] Bride of Jesus Christ when we are babies
[1:15:47] we're laws we're
[1:15:50] lawyers that's right I don't do that no
[1:15:54] more why are they still doing it we
[1:15:57] become lawyers we become the law but
[1:16:00] that law was part of our growth
[1:16:02] development but it brought us to Christ
[1:16:05] amen that's right it brought us to
[1:16:08] Christ that we might be
[1:16:09] justified by faith
[1:16:14] yes I'm GNA burn some of you hide but
[1:16:17] here we go you ready take
[1:16:22] yourself
[1:16:24] what's a school Master School Master
[1:16:26] tells you says Hey 1+ 1 is two 2 plus 2
[1:16:30] is 4 4 plus 4 is eight right there a
[1:16:33] school Master you have to go to school
[1:16:35] you have to go to school and learn these
[1:16:38] things so there's a law there that
[1:16:41] brings you to Christ but listen when you
[1:16:45] got into second and third grade
[1:16:47] everybody with me when you get in second
[1:16:49] and third grade that teacher don't have
[1:16:51] to go back over 1 plus one is two now
[1:16:53] maybe the second grade did but when when
[1:16:55] I got in calculus in
[1:16:58] college there was no mention of 1 plus
[1:17:00] one is too because you know what it was
[1:17:02] inside of
[1:17:03] me it was a it was something I inherited
[1:17:07] from that first grade teacher I needed
[1:17:09] that first grade
[1:17:12] teacher so why we have to beg people to
[1:17:14] come to church why we have to beg people
[1:17:15] to be on
[1:17:18] time we don't
[1:17:20] believe what God Said
[1:17:24] you're supposed to be here 20 minutes
[1:17:25] before the service starts pray and read
[1:17:27] your Bible some of y'all walk in when
[1:17:28] Bob's talking some of you walk in this
[1:17:30] and some of you you shouldn't do
[1:17:32] that there's an
[1:17:34] order there's an order to
[1:17:37] everything and the Holy Spirit loves
[1:17:40] that order and if you're out of that
[1:17:42] order you bind him you bind the Holy
[1:17:46] Ghost brother Mar said one unconfessed
[1:17:49] sin we need to
[1:17:50] pray one unconfessed sin
[1:17:55] can make a whole church fail whole
[1:17:57] church cuz you bound the holy spirit so
[1:18:01] like I said before I don't have to go
[1:18:03] back to the first grade to remember I
[1:18:05] need to be here 20 minutes before
[1:18:06] service starts to remember I need to
[1:18:07] read my Bible to remember I need to stud
[1:18:09] remember I need to come to
[1:18:12] church that ought to be inherent inside
[1:18:14] of you and just be like your everyday
[1:18:16] movement all right if you got a job I
[1:18:19] mean Dad worked on assembly line for
[1:18:21] almost 30 years
[1:18:24] well his job he didn't have to come in
[1:18:26] after 20 years brother George unless
[1:18:28] they moved him to another job he didn't
[1:18:29] have to come in and
[1:18:31] go I might to figure this out again I I
[1:18:34] don't know what in the world after you
[1:18:36] do it for 20 years you ought to be able
[1:18:37] to be common to you you ought to be able
[1:18:40] to get your tail up and come to church
[1:18:44] right and not have to be
[1:18:47] told it should be inherent inside of
[1:18:51] us cuz we fall if we don't you said it's
[1:18:53] just some if I'm five minutes that ain't
[1:18:56] you to say that's right right it's a
[1:18:59] prophet of God said 20 minutes for
[1:19:00] service he meant something by that oh
[1:19:04] that was just brother Brandon well now
[1:19:05] when who who decided you were going to
[1:19:08] decide what was God and what was
[1:19:14] not go get here on time all right get
[1:19:17] here before
[1:19:18] time but after that faith has come we
[1:19:20] are no longer under a school master
[1:19:23] words we don't need to be taught that
[1:19:25] again but we do for we are all the
[1:19:29] children of God in faith in Christ
[1:19:31] Jesus let's continue on just for a
[1:19:33] second and we'll close right here the
[1:19:35] heir as long as he's a child differeth
[1:19:37] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:19:39] of all though though we have everything
[1:19:40] when we become the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:19:42] when we become born again you get
[1:19:44] everything you need for your journey so
[1:19:46] just lay down and just take a nap and
[1:19:48] just take a nap for the rest of your
[1:19:50] journey and just you'll be the best CR
[1:19:52] no
[1:19:54] you'll die that's right take that baby
[1:19:57] beautiful it is put it in that room shut
[1:19:59] the
[1:20:00] door about two weeks later you going you
[1:20:03] going to have a dead child same way in
[1:20:06] Christianity that's right that's why you
[1:20:07] need to come to church you need to feed
[1:20:09] on the word of God for I say that the
[1:20:11] heir as long as he's a child differ
[1:20:13] nothing from a servant though he be Lord
[1:20:15] of all but is under tutors and governors
[1:20:18] what the word of God preach is like
[1:20:19] brother Bob was talking about preach to
[1:20:21] a group of people
[1:20:23] a fivefold Ministry and also others that
[1:20:26] can
[1:20:27] help can help you through these
[1:20:30] things but look but when the fullness of
[1:20:32] time was come God sent his son he didn't
[1:20:33] have to keep talking about
[1:20:36] it he's
[1:20:40] here wherefore there are no more a
[1:20:42] servant but a son and if a son then an
[1:20:44] heir of God through Christ and then we
[1:20:47] talking about at Bar Mitzvah which they
[1:20:48] do over in in Israel they have a ritual
[1:20:51] when you come to your 13th birthday
[1:20:52] which means that you have learned from
[1:20:54] many tutors and many
[1:20:56] Governors and now listen every child
[1:20:59] that turns 13 years old doesn't go
[1:21:02] through a bar
[1:21:04] mitzvah it's if you come to the
[1:21:07] requirements of your
[1:21:10] tutor that you go to
[1:21:13] that all right because the boy is now
[1:21:16] deemed personally responsible for
[1:21:18] fulfilling all the Commandments May hfor
[1:21:22] henceforth D pharies which is symbols
[1:21:25] and what those things they wear on their
[1:21:26] forehead and they wear on their arm and
[1:21:28] all that stuff during the weekly morning
[1:21:30] prayer and may be counted as an adult
[1:21:32] whenever 10 male adults are needed to
[1:21:34] form a quorum for a public prayer very
[1:21:37] important to come to adoption even in
[1:21:40] the natural sense now I want to read
[1:21:41] this let's stand to our feet come on
[1:21:44] musicians I highlighted this year
[1:21:46] because this is
[1:21:50] 1953 all right that's what 70 years ago
[1:21:55] this
[1:21:57] year 70 years ago this is what our
[1:22:00] Prophet was preaching across the river
[1:22:03] they went say what will you ask I wish
[1:22:04] we'd have time to take up before the law
[1:22:06] of adoption Pentecost was born that's
[1:22:09] right like the son but that same son was
[1:22:12] born in a family had to be adopted also
[1:22:16] that's right and there's where you
[1:22:18] missed your calling
[1:22:21] friend when the adoption time come if
[1:22:24] the tutor that raised the child find the
[1:22:27] finds the child not
[1:22:30] worthy they absolutely still remained a
[1:22:33] son but missed their
[1:22:36] adoption but if they were adopted into
[1:22:39] the family they were full Fellowship any
[1:22:41] check they wrote was good as one of the
[1:22:42] day wrote that's what's the matter today
[1:22:45] brother the church ought to be an
[1:22:47] adoption right now 1953 70 years from
[1:22:50] this year the church ought to be in
[1:22:52] adoption right now bringing into the
[1:22:54] full favors of God but the thing we up
[1:22:57] and down and in and out up and down and
[1:22:59] in and out to God can't trust us with
[1:23:02] nothing
[1:23:03] hardly all right 1959 let's get on a
[1:23:06] little bit further closer to our age
[1:23:09] some of us weren't even born in
[1:23:10] 1959 what the Holy Ghost was given for
[1:23:13] what watch what he says what is it he's
[1:23:16] pouring in his Spirit then those who are
[1:23:18] resting out you under in the grave or
[1:23:20] under the altar of God as the scripture
[1:23:21] says are crying how long Lord how long
[1:23:23] how much longer God's waiting on me and
[1:23:27] you the church is waiting on me and you
[1:23:30] adoption time when God can pour into us
[1:23:33] his
[1:23:35] fullness his power his resurrection that
[1:23:38] when the church and Christ become so
[1:23:40] close together till Christ becomes
[1:23:42] visible Among Us in a bride and raises
[1:23:46] the dead and we go in
[1:23:48] Rapture we'll stop right here we'll pick
[1:23:50] it up this afternoon and I wrot wrote
[1:23:52] myself a note false Doctrine hinders the
[1:23:55] Holy
[1:23:56] Spirit our unconfessed sins are the
[1:23:59] things that we
[1:24:00] do we should be the most repentant
[1:24:02] people in the world God I'm sorry I did
[1:24:06] that cuz Christians are the only ones
[1:24:08] that have sins brother Ram said right
[1:24:11] hello
[1:24:13] sins because we sin every day but we
[1:24:16] have an
[1:24:17] advocate did you say father I didn't
[1:24:19] mean to do that I really didn't now
[1:24:22] listen if you didn't get convicted for
[1:24:23] it you need to be in the
[1:24:25] altar do y'all not get maybe I need to
[1:24:28] preach to somebody else do youall not
[1:24:30] get convicted every day about something
[1:24:32] every day every single day you go Lord I
[1:24:35] should have never done that or why did I
[1:24:38] do that even the very thoughts in my
[1:24:40] mind I say Lord where did I come from
[1:24:43] why but
[1:24:45] listen he's not in that part he's
[1:24:50] here we got to remember that so anyway
[1:24:52] false Doctrine hinders the holy spirit
[1:24:54] that mine and yours all right false
[1:24:58] Doctrine you say I don't have any false
[1:24:59] Doctrine yeah we all have F all of us

[1:26:20] she wore out a Volvo
[1:26:22] 300 and something thousand miles before
[1:26:24] it kind of went well things wear out cuz
[1:26:26] it's human stuff you know she did it

[1:26:59] lot of us but four hours for years not
[1:27:03] just oh well I I well I don't know if I
[1:27:06] want to do this anymore she had a fervor
[1:27:09] she'd come here and she'd do tapes
[1:27:10] before people would get here when we
[1:27:12] were doing um you know running tapes off
[1:27:15] she'd run tapes she' help out all she
[1:27:17] could four
[1:27:19] hours we ought to be ashamed
[1:27:23] you got to get the Holy Ghost that's
[1:27:25] right amen but there's Witnesses see
[1:27:28] there's Witnesses
[1:27:29] everywhere I don't have the same Faith
[1:27:31] as maybe a brother
[1:27:34] has I got a problem I should have the fa
[1:27:37] same Faith he
[1:27:38] does so I'm going to judge myself for
[1:27:40] that there's a problem somewhere maybe
[1:27:42] same way with all of us we all got I
[1:27:44] mean try she's stand back there with her
[1:27:45] head down she don't want to be
[1:27:47] recognized but but God help us there's a
[1:27:50] witness in everything there's a witness
[1:27:53] there and when you come up with an
[1:27:55] excuse and go like
[1:27:59] it um your sister that lived with y'all
[1:28:02] for 20 something years down there at
[1:28:03] Lula she drove four hours in the morning
[1:28:06] that means listen you and
[1:28:09] I can get up some of y'all that don't
[1:28:13] get here on time can get up at
[1:28:17] 9:30 would you already be here by then
[1:28:21] and just wobble on to
[1:28:23] church she had to get up at she had to
[1:28:26] leave at 5:00 in the morning to drive
[1:28:30] four hours to get here at
[1:28:32] 9:00 5:00 in the morning and like I said
[1:28:35] when she go when she'd take off and go
[1:28:37] home we'd go out and eat we'd go sit
[1:28:39] down and eat and we'd fellowship and
[1:28:41] we'd go home and we'd be in our jammies
[1:28:42] and she'd just barely be getting
[1:28:45] home what's wrong with
[1:28:48] us she had the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:28:51] was driving her to the word of
[1:28:53] God right cuz that she passed probably
[1:28:57] 50 message churches one or two that was
[1:29:01] not far from your house where she used
[1:29:03] to go she used to go to another church
[1:29:06] way back when she could have just easily
[1:29:08] said I think I'll just go over here no
[1:29:11] she wanted to hear something she wanted
[1:29:13] to hear the word of God like it had
[1:29:15] never been preached
[1:29:16] before that's what she saw in brother
[1:29:18] Dale she saw a message righteous truy
[1:29:20] that that she had never heard before and
[1:29:23] she wanted to hear some more and at that
[1:29:25] time there was no internet like that
[1:29:27] when she first started so she had to
[1:29:28] come to church or she got it on a
[1:29:30] cassette tape and she didn't like to
[1:29:31] listen three or four days or or three or
[1:29:34] four weeks down the road she wanted to
[1:29:35] listen to it fresh so she came to church
[1:29:39] God help us
[1:29:40] all all of our excuses there is none in
[1:29:43] the gospel there's no
[1:29:46] excuses you'll get up and you won't miss
[1:29:48] a doctor's appointment by 30 minutes
[1:29:50] I'll promise you that will you cuz it
[1:29:52] cost you money hey maybe we
[1:29:56] start never heard of a church having a
[1:29:58] late fee but we can always start
[1:30:01] one if you're late you put more in a
[1:30:03] offing
[1:30:05] plate I'm just
[1:30:08] kidding but we should be
[1:30:11] here and try our best to never hinder a
[1:30:16] service try our best never when somebody
[1:30:19] comes up for prayer I've told you many
[1:30:20] times before I don't pray for that
[1:30:21] person
[1:30:23] the anointing is on the preacher that
[1:30:25] person has a need I don't have to know
[1:30:27] it I ain't got to stick my ear in it but
[1:30:29] when brother Dale would pray for him
[1:30:31] You' see me over there rais my hand I
[1:30:32] said God forgive
[1:30:35] me at this moment take anything out of
[1:30:37] my life that'll hinder the Holy Ghost to
[1:30:39] helping those people because brother
[1:30:41] rown said that does happen and that
[1:30:43] would happen you can hinder the Holy
[1:30:45] Ghost because of your unconfessed sin or
[1:30:47] my unconfessed sin so I want to make
[1:30:49] sure that on the day of judgment our
[1:30:51] judgment now not listen not Judgment of
[1:30:53] of whether you get eternal life or not
[1:30:55] I'm talking about the Jud Judgment of
[1:30:56] Deeds Done in the body whether good or
[1:30:58] bad we are going to have to go to a
[1:30:59] minor judgment because we do get crowns
[1:31:01] and we do get all these different things
[1:31:02] positions but I don't want him to God to
[1:31:04] say hey now brother Wade said sister
[1:31:07] Trudy come up here for prayer she really
[1:31:09] was sick and you cut that guy off and
[1:31:12] you said a word you weren't supposed to
[1:31:13] I'm just making an
[1:31:15] example and you hindered her from
[1:31:17] getting
[1:31:18] healed I don't want that I don't want
[1:31:20] that on my account there's a lot of
[1:31:21] things going to be my account but I hope
[1:31:22] that one thing is I don't want to be a
[1:31:24] hindrance to anybody to get healed or
[1:31:26] get delivered I want people

[1:34:23] got on lipstick y'all y'all that know
[1:34:25] her we saw her all right had on lipstick
[1:34:28] cuz nobody ever T her she would just
[1:34:29] coming up she needed help she needed
[1:34:32] prayer because there was demons
[1:34:34] screaming at her she needed
[1:34:38] help when now brother Dell didn't say
[1:34:40] now bless God sister don't you come back
[1:34:41] in here she came to church about three
[1:34:43] months brother John with pants
[1:34:45] on makeup big old earbobs look like
[1:34:47] fishing
[1:34:48] lures right you remember we all remember
[1:34:51] that
[1:34:53] now most churches would
[1:34:55] have beat her from the first sermon to
[1:34:58] the last one but thank God we had a a
[1:35:02] messenger yes that could preach the Holy
[1:35:06] Ghost Inside of somebody without killing
[1:35:08] them physically so brother Dell just
[1:35:11] kept preaching we never had to go take
[1:35:13] her back in the study and say hey you
[1:35:14] need to quit doing that about 3 or 4
[1:35:16] months after that Cindy comes in with no
[1:35:19] makeup
[1:35:20] on Cindy comes in with natural
[1:35:24] hair Cindy comes in with the dress on
[1:35:28] just you see the transformation right in
[1:35:31] front of you without having
[1:35:33] to beat her with a stick right and then
[1:35:36] she quit taking pills I mean she may had
[1:35:39] to have some to get by but it wasn't
[1:35:41] like when the first time she walked in
[1:35:42] here I mean she was like a drug addict
[1:35:43] almost right I'm not telling lie right
[1:35:46] not exaggerating she was out of that she
[1:35:48] was out of it come back to her sense she
[1:35:51] come here she said I want the Holy Ghost
[1:35:53] so
[1:35:54] bad I've wasted part of my life I want
[1:35:58] the Holy Ghost so bad we had prayer with
[1:36:01] her and I believe she got it in her own
[1:36:03] little simple way I believe she did cuz
[1:36:06] she Ste kept coming to church she kept
[1:36:08] reading her Bible sure well my Lord
[1:36:10] there things in your past you got to try
[1:36:12] to get rid of listen this is a an
[1:36:14] instant gospel but I think it takes time
[1:36:18] am for us to grow into being a wife yeah
[1:36:21] and I think Sandy we watched her
[1:36:23] grow and she was older though her her
[1:36:26] time was was limited she'd be her body
[1:36:28] up really I mean she'd wore her body out
[1:36:30] with all the taking the pills and stuff
[1:36:32] nervous always nervous about something
[1:36:35] she calmed down she was just as calm
[1:36:37] afterwards and I mean brother John
[1:36:39] totally different person transformed
[1:36:41] right in front of our
[1:36:43] eyes so she got sick she they'd be put
[1:36:45] in a nursing home so I bet you she'd
[1:36:47] love to be back here we know our bodies
[1:36:48] wear out you look at brother Dale
