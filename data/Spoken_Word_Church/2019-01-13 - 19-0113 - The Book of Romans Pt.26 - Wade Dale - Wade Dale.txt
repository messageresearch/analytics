TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so well back up just a minute or Paul is ignoring the people rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep our problem is if we rejoice another people we we should rejoice when they were Georgian week when they leave enter in with their Tsar be at the same mind one toward another minds not high things do not set your mind on high things but condescend to men of low estate remember brother Brennan said the granite stone the greatest man he ever met made you feel good made you feel like you were the one that was the greatest right and it says associate with the humble the men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits your own estimation right recompense to no man evil for evil remember we're not in the eye for an eye a tooth for tooth partisans Christians died for an eye tooth for tooth those fish steal dude we've been talking about right cuz they want to avenge the word avenge and not being in a critical tabulating provide things honest inside of all men know that I want to see this before I want to talk about just a minute Paul said if it be possible now this so this is not a commandment he didn't say I command you live peaceably with all men no he says if it be possible as much as lies in you as much as you got inside yourself live peaceable with all men all right so that's that's kind of the way it is I mean is we go up the statue a perfect man we learn to live more peaceable because of difference and patience or not gardening this for brotherly kindness that's what lying in you as much as what was in the in other words and what's inside of you as much as it depends on in you live peaceably with all men dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath there we'll go back to the Vengeance there's no there's no vengeance in the Christian yes there's no we don't keep score that's our problem we keep score yes if you do it for me I'll do it for you no you do it for them what the Bible said you do good to an evil person what if you do it heats coals on their head not your heat the cold on their head but brother give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine so let who's mine got some God let God God's gonna take care of the judgment he's gonna take care of the vengeance Bendis his mind I wanted to repay saith the Lord now that's his deal I was like Jason Washington's preaching one Friday night had to do good time he didn't get doing good job that's when he was talking about he said vengeance is mine I will repay leave it to God let him do you know give it to him let him take care of it and did not try to repay a debt or of avenging debt for a debt or whatever morning that was the Old Testament hmm that was your checks and balances and as as he was talking about we are prisoners were prisoners of Christ I was hoping he'd get on that Paul of being a prisoner if somebody else he said the world says loud not a Christian I'm free I can do whatever I want to he said that's deep and he did say the word stupid he said that is just a stupid assumption that you're free and he said but in Christ he said we trade one one one bondage for another because we are free in Christ but run to bondage to him he's our husband we do what he says you know and which is good and then you go to Paul prison or Christ he's finally become a prisoner what the love-affairs like he said he said there's so many billion women in the world he said what they'd won one that I love there's one woman that I submit to that one woman that I'm that I'm with and I said and that's miss you know that's mr. Watkins the narcs just one so that's the way it is with Christ and then one person we submit to and that's cars and we were submissive to him yes it did right he saw your sister that your brother Burdette was there but her husband wasn't there he had to work yeah we got brother Timothy was there and myself and dad mom Jim Lindt brother all up on pain the kid three digs just trying to name the preachers for the whole team where the whole team was there he preached Saturday morning when he get to go Saturday will went Friday night so we supported them on Friday night barley no bigger new don't go off about a month oh yeah yeah I don't much use of little I said you say usko and you hit your ball hitting you can see the ridge yeah we got I don't know you got that okay yeah we did go to the dedication Friday night so it's a good time why do you go out and got me go they're special people don't be so narrow-minded we can't get out Phillip that's right therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so deep did I just read that man ago try so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head see here's our problem being people I'm talking about being people we think if we're bad to somebody that's good when you were in the world and you didn't have Christ in your heart getting back at somebody was good don't sit there with your mouth open yeah I guaranteed you did you yeah because you're right and you have a problem with it still now yeah they do it to me I do it to them but being a Christian did you live in a different world but I don't know but I grew up and if somebody did something to me I did my dad level best to get back out yeah there you go they made sure that if he missed one he got one ahead we kept score but we don't keep score anymore that's what Paul's saying we don't keep score anymore if somebody's mean to you the best thing to do is just try to be kind but look for some y'all that came in late Paul said this is not a commandment it's kind of like laughter that's Cal night Friday night we were supposed to start at 7 o'clock at church I'm gonna tell it to Burley oberly that way it was 7:00 7:15 no barely know you know Jason Watkins already been there for birdie when there he finally comes out not only need over told Jim and Mama said somebody they said 7 o'clock I said that was a suggestion that was a suggestion to be their example the cost kinda like the Ten Commandments are not Commandments anymore they're suggestions ok so Paul says if it be possible then he you know come sometimes he'll say I command G of all men or I command him to do this another word he did say that easy it may be possible as much as what you got inside of you live peaceably with all men because sometimes it can't happen you know as well as I do people cut you off on the road and personal plane another earth or somebody do evil to you there is a little something that raises up that old part of you that's dead but you're still tied to it because of what you were born a car line coming in here is not your solace in this personal by near the the memories and conservation imagination were fighting through the statue a bourbon man right in fact we believe in Jesus I mean you know how much the story goes that he he took time to plant that rope he knew he was plotting his course he was watching them people in that temple and he would send their plane even flat one that's long I don't think right he planted one long enough that we can get to everybody yeah so God himself in human flesh was sitting there braiding the Rope you how long it takes to braid your hair he said they're brave door open when I want to start with that one and I won't if that one's still in here he's going to get it too right I mean really I mean he turned over table he showed a little bit of but you know what you've done he done that because they were in his father's house doing a commandment he knew they knew better than today right okay so but to us to us you know though but the filter of he's not a he's a glorified human now and if you look back on that he'd never do that again never so now he comes back inside of us to try to teach us the same thing to not to do that don't plaque don't let your oak alright and and then if you do if possible if you do have to speak then you know let's just human being but we gotta minimize our mistakes you'll never do away with all your mistakes but you can minimize them you can learn how to correct them and learn how to to control therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good all right continue the thought I'll remember this is chapter thirteen but Paul is continuing his thought man's one to put chapter thirteen than took a break but there's no break in his letter he's writing this letter excuse me let every soul be subject to the higher powers now I want to talk on this just a little bit maybe not today and for those of you that came in a little bit later you know we were talking that says that means governing and that means authority alright it's like we were coming out rather Jason Watkins talking about being under bondage people say you're free in the world now you're under total bondage to the devil but when you become a Christian become in bondage also that's the bondage of blood I'm in a bondage of level of my wife you're in the bottom two level your wife or your husband or wife one bank for but for those of you that came in a little bit later I'm gonna we got only like three chapters left in the book of Romans I had suggested us doing the book of Hebrews but I kind of felt checked the other day to let maybe you suggest to me what's on your heart instead of me just picking the subject makes again you should get some English from your heart sister Johnny said the nine spirit to speak on a non spiritual gift sister have a canard said go ahead and start in Hebrews and indeed Hebrews is rich really but if there's a general question for somebody else we need to do we need to take that under consideration so you think about it we've got about probably three four more weeks we'll get into probably March and we'll start on whatever you want start on so y'all just kind of discuss it among yourself I'll take that into consideration we'll take that in consideration anybody else that's something else and then what we'll do is well do like they're doing to ministers me ministers meeting there's twenty ministers and they they will let wants to top it for next time when one says well let's talk alone me Burke one says let's talk me and I'm saying two weeks well then say that this or that well we broke Tim Rice them down and they we vote so you have a hand vote and whoever wins that's the subject we pick first and we drop the next subject down to the next okay so we don't do away with that if he bruised is voted on then we'll do nine spiritual gifts after that so it'll be the will of people okay and then you pray it let it be the will of God inside you to speak you know right but let's talk about it for me let every soul be subject when to the higher powers that's like what brother Jason was talking about to Friday Paul was a prisoner to Christ he thought he was free when he was putting them Christians in them in the in jail right but he wasn't he was in bondage to Satan because God wasn't causing him to do that Satan was causing him to do that but then he turns around and then he says Paul a prisoner of Christ now he now is a prisoner a love slave whatever you want to call it it is it's a love affair so love slave like those of you who weren't here Jason's brother Jason did a good job talking about this he said there's a there's almost one point two point something big and women in the world he said but I only got one woman that I'm subject to that's mrs. or sister watch mr. Watkins his wife he said I only got wanted to worry about its that same way with God dog may have had different one he had a wife he had a Jewish wife remember what we've been talking about it's damn right well he hadn't put her away how you put the denomination's away but he's got one wife and then they're subject to each other alright but we know one thing's for sure how are you going to be over and over subject to the Creator you can't you can't control what the Creator does right amen yes that was another good point he was making he used me and dad as an example he said there's not one thing brother Wade can do for being brother sambel son nothing nothing people fight stuff all the time you know and I don't find it well no I'm not my daddy well yeah it you can't deny that let's do you anything God your Creator God's the one that lives inside of you these want to give you the new birth so he is the higher power because don't fear the man that can kill the body fear the man that can kill the soul there's only one person in the whole universe they can kill your soul and that's done but he can't kill his own soul that's it he cannot kill himself so if you are him that was the whole point if she is him if you're him he can't give you that's mine you going around are you you take a death or take a body changing either one you're alive more than you've ever been alive in your life you're alive now that's right but you're our prisoner Christ we didn't throw this thing away we still live by but we become it that Weiser written it's written epistle this word now is walking on two feet yes but there still has to be a higher power we have to have just as the wife should be subject to the husband and we'll go back to what Paul says if it possible you all get that demand that the Bible says as the husband treats a wife and wife treated her the same way with Christ in the church yeah so if you're not submissive to your husband now that don't go to meat and then everything else but if you're not submissive to your husband and keep your mouth shut when you supposed to sisters I'm sorry same way with us if we don't keep our mouths shut then God's gonna go shut your mouth we must be subject to the higher power because as we treat our wife God don't treat us that's what the Bible said all right hey that's one we have one problem food we're not submissive enough all right but look there is no power but of God Satan has no power right you know what the power comes from see that that's authority the power to create is only in God that's see to me that's the ultimate power you can you can have billions of worlds but if you don't have a living soul on it it's worthless yeah but the higher power is is that God created the soul we become like this coming home Friday about nature and and the things of nature there's a natural occurrence that goes on in nature but it's god it's god it's his nature when we see this name next it's nature no like I was talking to girl cutting my hair that was coming to Dean a hairdresser and the answered the phone she said beauty shop I said you live may be beautiful in 30 years no but she was talking about she was talking about them how the natural world's going storms and only stuff you see I said well now God give us this nature nature I mean out there you know animals and plants and stuff and they do their thing but what about something so important that God put a soul in a man to give them a god-like quality and that's what you have even the center has that godlike quality look we change things a bird builds and that's the same way brother I'm talking about that but if we if we keep building our houses the same way they just be the you know the little cookie cutter houses and but and what we advance as we advance we are those gods and God give us that power because we're on the earth he said here you take care of the earth I'll take care of heaven that's what he told Adam what happened was even though even in a fallen condition man still has power you have power to go to heaven or hell that power lies in you that's your decision God don't decide her he would be a respect for persons and it would be sure enough predestination stamped like this no no your free moral agent to me from relation is probably the second highest power from creation because you decide god gives you the decision but now then we'll let's come back to us being little creators we are all creative programs that you walk in a room you can create an atmosphere that was not there before right you've created it if you weren't in that room it wouldn't be created you created that atmosphere all right so we are a little created but Allah gods give us power he's give us he gave us all power but he still the higher power even Satan has to ask God for permission to do things you know that he had asked permission to talk to you and get around Joe and what did God do now Satan would have been all-powerful he said well I'm just gonna kill him today and I'm done with it that's what identifies the devil I said 10 seconds from now he's gonna be dead but God said do anything you want to I can't take his life its life is mine I decide whether he lives or dies you don't decide whether he lives or dies all right so that's the higher power to me that creation is the higher power mm-hmm and who is the creator the Holy Ghost is the creator all that all that time together but the Holy Ghost is one that speaks the power to give you an hour hour and if you got the Holy Ghost that's my brother said you got the Holy Ghost you got what power to create a world and go live on it that's it all right but that's the power he'd give us because he gave us the Holy Ghost for there is no power but of God so there is no other you still all Satan's got this I kind of want to cover something after them maybe if I get into it about the two powers that we're talking about even in the seals you're talking about two powers there's only two brother brown said you're not a halfway Christian right you're either a you're either on this side or this side your soul is either faith or doubt there's no in-between so there's only and but there's only one power God permitted Satan power to do and what to Satan do he took his free moral agency and turned it into iniquity turned it into hideous sin and all these things that he does the powers that be are ordained of God well right with that there are danger God are there appointed by God he did give Satan power you're going on a chair might give you the anointing I give you what the word your the worship angel your to do this your to do that and what do you do he turned it to iniquity that's great because you got to you got to beings or you got two ways of going you literally have to reject God's power to go to hell you have to literally reject God to be fallen literally you have cuz that's what's gonna happen in judgement cars gonna stand there he said I give you everything you need it and on this day right here you turn me down amen and I know by my infinite wisdom if I come to you every day for the rest of your life you'd have never done the same thing see that's what helped me with predestination and people I ate off Hitler and all that work brother groundhogs buddy couldn't be saved hey well it never became in God's mind he can never be saved but he had to give him a choice down here and by that choice God said Wells cuz cuz I knew one thing's for sure if he'd give Adolf Hitler a million years by His infinite wisdom he knew Adolf Hitler would never come to the knowledge of God so therefore he could let him live his life commit suicide be done he gone all right same way with anybody else in the world same way because that answers a lot of questions when we say what why did that why did this why why did he allow but you know what the worst power that you can prover is a religious power Eichmann and Hitler naturally killed six million Jews but the Roman Catholic Church brother Brown says the Roman Catholic Church by the crease in dogmas which goes into the Baptists and Methodists and all that has killed billions spiritually so that's works to me to be spiritually then than to be naturally dead but they still took the power gone for her because there's no power of Satan that's right yes whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God so in other words you resist the power of God now let's flip that around resist the devil and he'll free flee from you so you resist that part of power that God give to Satan you resist that and you're fine but don't resist the power of God resisting the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation so so whose choice is it theirs they resisted you as a spiritual a soul being your soul God give you that's all Injection do good jumble friday to about he says that all nature was attached to your to you when you were born that old Adamic nature and that had to die the soul didn't die the older damning nature had to die so that Christ could come in co-starred with therefore resisteth the power resisteth ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to them domination for rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil rulers well they'll then not be afraid of the power well do that which is good and you shall have praise of the same in other words they're not gonna get they're gonna get praised for the terror they're gonna get evil praise in other words made off that little people I say off Hitler because probably that would be to me the epitome of evil it's having six million people killed but I'm sure these people have more people killed than that down to the dark ages we just got an updated history the guy a new movie out about that last one Eichmann where the Messiah found him in Brazil or wherever it was Costa Rica and put him on trial my sixties in brother Graham speaks of that they were part of the Nuremberg trial now the Nuremberg trial is when all the generals and the little peons that fulfill the request to kill them they all got executed back in the late 40s yeah bout 48 don't like that 49 probably was know as 47 it was right after the work but they couldn't catch the big generals till they had enough money to dispersed herself we didn't have work about Hitler that he killed himself but Eichmann in Mandalay they went to a different country but you bet the Mossad founder but that guy you know what he was over when they found him through the doctor yeah he kept the same profession but when he got out from under that evil of Hitler I haven't helped people that was the whole paradox of the thing he became a doctor he had become a doctor of death he became a doctor tried to help the people whatever community was any became an outstanding doctor they couldn't believe that he was who that guy was you know but when he done he came out from under that power of Hitler but still they never repented so they did to him what they should have done no dude that was just good thou shalt have praise for the saint for he is the minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil an Avenger or a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore ye must needs to be subject not only for the wrath but also for conscience take name somebody whose that he Christ a higher power the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost ruh somebody amen listen there's a real fine line and you brothers and sisters know this being all being married for some length of time there is no real fine line between anarchy and being a love slave there's that blue demands down with no man you can be I'm the ruler you cook me breakfast you get up it wellnow o'clock in the morning you get up not around me really that's rulership that's not what that is nobody if you do it out of love then it turns everything around nice so there is there's a fine line there and see because the world looks at us the way we dress and the way we do now what does the world say about you all yours you're suppressed you're under bondage you you have I'll cut your hair you have to do that you have to wear your skirt sisters you you men you don't you can't drink and you can't smoke and you can't cook see what they said they're saying we're so depressed and suppressed under they just don't know that if they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul they'd come to this right here and be the happiest people in the world we should be the happiest people in the place the earth okay then we are free but we're free while we're still under the higher power yes yes because the Bible says we have Liberty in Christ but I think doesn't mean we overshoot Christ can we shooting down and say oh let's not I do what I want them now sometimes we do that yeah because we do do what we want to but you know what he's just said right here you get a little up you get a little smack on the hand right wherefore you must need to be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for for for for for for this cause pay tribute also now what is tribute taxes the guy time not so much money but time give your time give your tribute to God for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing now once God's ministers he's talking about he is interlaced and hearing brought down apostles prophets pastors teachers in evangelist the fivefold ministry is the head of the body of Christ God is the head he filters through the FIFO ministry out to the subjects on her out to us but we're not as a minister I don't stand back and say well now I'm part of fivefold ministry and all y'all are out there no listen when there's a preacher in the pulpit I miss subject as you are yes to the higher power I don't set myself aside and put my fans in my ear to say well I don't have to listen so is the preacher when I listen a preacher like brother Jason said he said that's a good point he said he said God's here he said I showed up to help him right I mean he's gonna use Maine Easter but he said God's here he said you guys never left he said I'm just standing it I just move into a position where God can speak through me excited to showed up don't start talking and that's trades if he's a god call man I say thank so what happened what happened it did nothing for for for this cause pay tribute also for their gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing render therefore to all their dudes tribute to them tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honor to whom honor because look herein lies our problem hearing lies all of our problem what brother Dale's always said what you consider you do is right but if since Johnny don't do what I do she's wrong now that's prevalent in this room ok I'm looking at all of you that's prevalent in this room if you do it the way I say it it's fine if you don't do it you're wrong that's not true you render custom to whom custom we don't go overseas and say look let's thought y'all will need to eat them you're not you're not supposed to you you're not an American yeah custom custom did you know couple likes and dislikes and stuff but if I have a custom what did Paul say if it's custom that you don't that they don't eat me you go into a congregation and they're vegetarian what do you say they give that steak he said each or steak at home don't don't say I may eat when I want to in front you know have a little respect custom for custom now they stop custom that you like I'm sure y'all show it but in the Philippines like the blue you know trend you know you stuff like that that's stealing I'm talking about in general alright in general it's like it if you go to Carl's house you take your shoes off what is that that's the custom yeah so we take our shoes off preachers all the way down so everybody take their shoes off kind of funny to look around you see boy you better wear a good sauce here you go that I look down the one with it Oh Josiah what's that gonna front row yeah don't wait what was it some kind of like goofy reindeers I thought it was something like that and one was red one was green and he's on the front row and his big ol feet sticking out like this you know the good side of that that's great shots or what is it you go no but that's a custom that you need to respect it always back your respect let somebody don't like the color blue they're not centered okay you don't like to do so and so as long as you stay under the higher power now if you sit in that congregation up here listening to the Word of God and you turned it down little different ballgame that's right different ballgame I was thinking you know that great big tall black guy Lee Lee singing from Bella Burley I miss guys like six seven he's got hands about that big I thought if he ever raised his hand in our sanctuary upstairs he kept see what I was thinking now they're ceilings real being high but when he put that hand up it looks like it goes like 12 feet you know I've been going like that but custom to whom custom fear to whom fear you know Paul picks up and says there's time to cry cry with them you know cry with them pray with them we like to condemn them know you need to kind of enter in that's right help them out like my new saying is this year I've got new year's resolution it ain't none of my business if you don't ask me to help you with something you ain't none of my business now if you ask me it becomes part of my business but if they don't any no my bed I really it's not I don't care but you got a problem and I got a problem I need to enter mine and you need to take care of yours now if you want to bust enter in together that's okay that means you've asked but other than that ain't into this gossip jump on some y'all are I'm not gonna gossip I forget that business that's all I hear sometimes fear to whom fear honor to him honor we need to honor the office remember we honor the office and if that man's in an office doing a good job you need to honor that man too because he's in that office we honor brother Dale comes the past you say well I don't want come he says irregardless which is not even worth well it so what Big D that's what I mean I know my baby just listen to what he's saying but the honor is the place the pastor man he spent a long time and I looked at him the other day that something man saving almost seventy nine years old he's been doing this he told me though they said you've been listening to message for 50 years because I was eight when we came in the message 1960s when he looked over reason you may listen to it for 50 years I have been doing it for 50 years there was a gap in there that I did my own thing you know that since I was eight years old I have heard the prophets voice that's been 50 I'm 58 I'll be 59 in a few weeks Danny we're 26 but but you don't realize that though there for 50 years even somebody not as young as me it has been hearing the prophets message to Lois a mr. Dave you've heard this thing he said you heard it as long as I that's why I didn't stay in it as long as he a white man me until you know in the night late 90 so but you got to pray for them pray for I'll pray for every by an office the Satan would love to kill everybody just give her them like yes you're everywhere it's down in the car Honduras I would mention no until every time I preach I've mentioned hey greetings from my church at home I said brothers brother Dale was you know comin in finesse it seems like 67 68 or whatever I said is the same thing that he preached back then is the same thing he's preaching now I tried many times you'd receive like clapping I know well was just a few yeah I hear the earth they hear that they and then that's one of the reason you watch you know so sure me they don't even know the man that they were third they're quiet about you know what they're honoring the office and Amanda send the officers in the office you just like I said about the higher power we are sheep we have two best my point then we'll stop right there stop right here alright but that's my whole point we are all sheep when I'm preaching I'm still a sheep to God God's the head the head Shepherd I haven't pulled myself out and set myself apart and well you know you beat the you know I'll get baked its leadership yes it's all come down to leadership and and we are sheep we all have to be led that's just it that's in the Bible that's in the prophets message we have to be led right now and for led by the Spirit of God through a man standing in the pulpit then god bless the man okay Sam like people my brother Carol man a you know 80 something years old you know of course he's retired but he's still alive he's still doing things for God he's alive in and same way with all of us we're all coming down but I couldn't believe what do you look toward means that you've been hearing this for 50 years but you don't realize that look some of you even sent even just say since 98 when I came back to the Lord look at some of you you already before then stayed in the message but even from 98 come now last year was 20 years 98 2008 2018 that's 30 years you've been with me a lot of you with me listening to the man all right and I don't go with me and say what I ain't nothing going on with my brother Li even even rotation watching hit it too cuz that it's prevalent
