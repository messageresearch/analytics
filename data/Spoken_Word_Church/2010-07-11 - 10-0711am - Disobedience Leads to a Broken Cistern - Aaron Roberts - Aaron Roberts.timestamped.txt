[37:32] far from me and have walked after vanity
[37:35] and are become vain neither said they
[37:38] where is the Lord that brought us up out
[37:40] of the land of Egypt that led us through
[37:42] the Wilderness through a land of deserts
[37:45] and of pits through a land of drought
[37:48] and of the shadow of death through a
[37:50] land that no man passed through where no
[37:54] man
[37:55] dwelt and I brought you into a plentiful
[37:58] country to eat the fruit thereof and the
[37:59] goodness thereof and when ye entered ye
[38:02] defiled my land and made my in Heritage
[38:04] an Abomination the priest said not where
[38:07] is the Lord and they have handled and
[38:11] they that handled the law knew me not
[38:13] the pastors also transgressed against me
[38:16] and the prophesied prophesied by Baal

[39:00] broken ssts that can hold no water amen
[39:04] Lord bless the word this morning you may
[39:06] be
[39:09] seated and uh yall just pray for me I
[39:13] speak a little bit on the on the life of
[39:15] on
[39:16] Jeremiah and the condition of of
[39:21] Israel and then there's many scriptures
[39:23] you can refer to in the uh
[39:27] in the in the book of Jeremiah when you
[39:29] speak of of Jeremiah's
[39:32] life and we we understand that uh
[39:35] Jeremiah came 60 years roughly 60 years
[39:41] after
[39:43] Isaiah and
[39:45] Isaiah and this is from the this is from
[39:48] the message broken sisters and sistens
[39:50] and brother brandom says and now during
[39:52] the time of Jeremiah here his prophecy
[39:55] it had been about 60 years since the
[39:57] death of
[39:58] Isaiah and they had been about 60 years
[40:00] without a major prophet there was a back
[40:03] and some of the small Minor Prophets but
[40:04] Isaiah was the last major prophet and
[40:07] the people had during this time had no
[40:10] no one to call them out and they had
[40:12] drifted yet they were God's people and
[40:15] have drifted into this state now that we
[40:17] find them as Jeremiah came to prophesy
[40:19] to them and Jeremiah also was he Pro
[40:23] prophesied before the Exile and also
[40:25] went into Exile with them
[40:28] now we know that Jeremiah Was came in a
[40:32] time when they had no there was no uh
[40:36] Prophet major prophet to bring them the
[40:38] word to bring them to a place and they
[40:41] had drifted away from
[40:43] God and we we know that
[40:47] um Jeremiah Was A was a man and you know
[40:51] the the amazing thing that we all people
[40:53] always speak of about Jeremiah even
[40:54] brother R speaking of Jeremiah Was
[40:57] that in chapter
[41:00] one you know this is the when God come
[41:03] and spoke to Jeremiah he said before I
[41:04] formed thee in the belly I knew thee and
[41:07] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[41:08] I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[41:11] prophet unto the Nations so Jeremiah was
[41:14] already called and brother bam said even
[41:16] Jeremiah Was was just like all the other
[41:18] prophets Jeremiah didn't want to be a
[41:21] prophet he tried to run from it just
[41:23] like Moses tried to run from his calling
[41:25] but he was still still ordained a
[41:29] prophet
[41:31] and he also said Jeremiah also God
[41:34] speaking to Jeremiah also says see I
[41:36] have made this day set thee over the
[41:38] Nations and over the
[41:40] kingdoms he says to root out to pull
[41:43] down to destroy to throw down to build
[41:47] and to plant see when when Jeremiah came
[41:51] there was a work for him to do but it
[41:54] wasn't all
[41:56] destruction the destruction came because
[41:58] that's what the people wanted right it
[42:00] wasn't it wasn't his fault Right Said
[42:04] see the calling he had the calling to
[42:07] call the people back to the
[42:09] word and that's what he was wanting him
[42:12] to
[42:12] do and you know you start to read
[42:15] through the book of Jeremiah and I
[42:16] always keep coming I always kept coming
[42:18] back to the book and I kept trying to
[42:22] find what you know just get my mind on
[42:24] something from the Lord and I just kept
[42:26] coming back to this this one chapter and
[42:28] you start looking at at Jeremiah's life
[42:30] and here's Jeremiah calling to the
[42:32] people trying to call them back and it
[42:35] says that you know he called day and
[42:37] night before the
[42:38] people and you know he had
[42:41] a you know it's a
[42:43] very thankless job when you look at all
[42:47] the things that Jeremiah was trying to
[42:49] do to the for the people right because
[42:52] you know when he and one of the reason I
[42:56] I chose chapter too I just come back to
[42:58] this because here it is when many times
[43:02] or different times you'll see Jeremiah
[43:04] referring back to the
[43:06] fathers that he brought them out of the
[43:08] land of Egypt and when he calls them
[43:10] when he calls their attention back to
[43:12] the land of Egypt and he speaks and he
[43:14] goes back in different times he'll talk
[43:16] about the land of flowing with milk and
[43:17] honey and he goes back and as we've said
[43:20] spoke on before see when God come before
[43:24] the people and spoke to them he said
[43:26] show me where I have have
[43:28] failed because he said when I talk to
[43:30] your fathers about the land flowing with
[43:31] milk and honey see they couldn't put a
[43:33] finger against God that God had failed
[43:35] them that God had lied to them had done
[43:38] anything wrong against them right but it
[43:41] was the people had walked away from God
[43:43] and so when he comes back and he talks
[43:45] about even those who handled the law see
[43:47] they knew the word but they had walked
[43:49] away from it right but see you know and
[43:52] you know it's just like when you go back
[43:54] before into the Old Testament you and
[43:56] you look when they built the ark of the
[44:00] covenant What was the Ark of the
[44:02] Covenant for it was a testimony against
[44:05] the people right because he gave them
[44:09] the two tables of stone it had the Mana
[44:12] and had the rod that
[44:15] budded and each one of them and you go
[44:18] back and you read in the scriptures
[44:19] every time it talks about the Ark of the
[44:21] Covenant and it talks about each one of
[44:23] talks about the
[44:25] Mana see they God fed them he you know
[44:30] and they were the ones that said we
[44:32] loathe this light
[44:35] bread but it was Angels
[44:39] food they hated it right but it was God
[44:43] fulfilling the
[44:44] promise just just as the Apostle Paul
[44:47] tells us he talks about he said they all
[44:50] walked under the
[44:52] cloud right they all have walked under
[44:54] the pillar of fire right he said each
[44:57] one of them he said they all drank from
[45:00] that spiritual rock that water that came
[45:02] out of the Rock right and he said that
[45:05] was Christ he said because when they
[45:07] when they were thirsty he gave them
[45:09] water when they when they were hungry he
[45:11] fed them right that's right and when you
[45:14] go back and see and he had that pot of
[45:16] Mana there in the in the Ark of the
[45:18] Covenant the Ark of the testimony why
[45:21] because it was a testimony against them
[45:23] right that they stood there because when
[45:25] they when they said where is God and
[45:28] they walked away from him but he stood
[45:30] there and was showing them that he was
[45:32] true and faithful to his word and so
[45:34] there he was and he had the Mana and the
[45:37] rod that budded to show God was leading
[45:41] them amen when he called when he was
[45:44] calling a group of men one of the tribes
[45:48] to be into the line of the high priest
[45:50] all right to be in the the priesthood he
[45:52] called him and the rod budded showing
[45:54] that Aaron's Aaron's group
[45:57] the Levites would be the ones that were
[46:00] in the
[46:02] priesthood right and when they stood
[46:04] against them and they
[46:07] died because that's what God done
[46:11] because of their murmuring and
[46:12] complaining and standing against the
[46:14] word and when they were consumed then
[46:18] they come back the next day you know
[46:20] they didn't come right back after after
[46:22] they were all consumed they waited a
[46:24] while and then they come back and told
[46:26] and told Moses and accuse Moses of
[46:29] killing God's
[46:30] people
[46:32] right
[46:33] right and what had happened it was them
[46:37] standing against the word right amen now
[46:40] why didn't they why didn't they just
[46:41] stand up right then and go against Moses
[46:44] and and speak of about what Moses had
[46:46] done right at that time when God was
[46:50] moving see they were so afraid that God
[46:53] when God was on the scene yeah but they
[46:56] you know then walked away and then they
[46:57] had to come by and accuse Moses but see
[47:01] each one of those each one of those
[47:03] things that was in the Ark of the
[47:04] Covenant was a testimony that God kept
[47:08] his word right you know I love that song
[47:11] and I don't I don't know if y'all know
[47:12] it y'all y'all might have y'all might
[47:14] know it but greater Vision has a song
[47:17] and it's called with all these many
[47:20] miracles I don't I don't know if y'all
[47:22] if y'all know it or not but you know I
[47:23] love that
[47:25] song because you know when it go when it
[47:28] goes through that song it talks about
[47:29] all these things that God has done right
[47:33] and you know if you look at all the
[47:35] things that God has done and if he's and
[47:38] if he's been faithful all the way
[47:40] through then how can we not have faith
[47:43] with all these many
[47:45] miracles when you look all the way
[47:47] through the Bible it talks about all the
[47:48] many miracles that the Israel the
[47:51] children of Israel being on their
[47:52] journey and him walking them through
[47:54] right and all the things that they faced
[47:58] and he met their need and met their need
[48:00] and then it comes to you know with all
[48:02] these many miracles and it you know
[48:04] talks about so you face a problem you
[48:06] think you cannot
[48:08] overcome but you've seen him come
[48:10] through all these different times then
[48:12] how can you stand there and say you know
[48:14] how can you not have faith and believe
[48:16] that's right with all these many
[48:19] miracles and you know that's the way it
[48:21] is this morning with all the many
[48:23] miracles see we don't have we don't
[48:26] stand up and we don't Proclaim and don't
[48:29] claim what's
[48:30] ours and so we stand here and and we're
[48:33] below our
[48:36] Privileges and we see that the that the
[48:39] children of Israel were the same way
[48:41] right because he's speaking this
[48:45] morning he
[48:47] said BL they have hewed them out sisters
[48:52] right Y and you know another fascinating
[48:55] anal I may bounce around a little bit
[48:57] this morning but I'm just trying to say
[49:00] what's on my heart this morning right
[49:02] one of the things about the book of
[49:03] Jeremiah I doing some doing some study
[49:06] and everything doing some reading do you
[49:08] know
[49:09] that the word obey obey any form of obey
[49:14] obeyed obeys
[49:16] whatever it's more it's used more in the
[49:18] book of Jeremiah than anywhere else in
[49:22] the Old
[49:23] Testament the word obey
[49:27] and it's used I think U it's used over
[49:32] almost half as many times as it is in in
[49:35] the whole new
[49:36] testament and so it's it's the one thing
[49:38] about Jeremiah that's that's what he
[49:40] talks about obey they've not obeyed my
[49:44] voice you go to you go to Jeremiah 11
[49:48] excuse me we may get get there in a
[49:49] little bit but that's all he talks about
[49:52] obey my voice obey my voice obey obey
[49:56] and that that's the whole that was the
[49:57] whole concept the whole point of
[50:00] Jeremiah writing was obey was
[50:05] obedience that was that was the whole
[50:07] point and here he is he's speaking all
[50:08] the way
[50:09] through and trying to bring them the
[50:13] people to God trying to show where the
[50:16] where they need to be right in Jeremiah
[50:19] chapter
[50:24] 7 verses 22
[50:35] and here and here's one of the times
[50:37] where they're speaking of the children
[50:40] of Israel and the
[50:42] fathers verse 21 says thus sayi the Lord
[50:44] of hosts the god of Israel put your
[50:47] burnt offerings un your sacrifices and
[50:51] eat flesh for I spake not unto your
[50:54] fathers nor commanded them in the day
[50:55] that brought that I brought them out of
[50:57] the land of Egypt concerning burn
[50:59] offerings or
[51:01] sacrifices but this thing commanded I
[51:04] them saying obey my voice and I will be
[51:07] your God and ye shall be my people and
[51:10] walk ye in all the ways that I have
[51:12] commanded you that it may be well with
[51:14] you but they hearkened not nor inclined
[51:17] their ear but walked in the counsels and
[51:19] in the imagination of their evil heart
[51:21] and went backward and not forward since
[51:25] the day that your father came forth out
[51:27] of the land of Egypt unto this day I
[51:30] have sent I have even sent unto you all
[51:33] my servants and Prophets Rising day
[51:35] daily rising up early and sending them
[51:40] right so here here he is he's speaking
[51:44] of obeying my
[51:46] voice and so he's speaking of even in in
[51:49] times past and he's and telling them see
[51:54] he's going pointing back because because
[51:56] God had a track record with them and
[51:59] they had a track record right and he
[52:01] knew what they had done and they knew
[52:03] what he had done right but he stood
[52:05] there and said listen obey my voice he
[52:07] said look he said when ever since I've
[52:09] brought your your fathers out of the
[52:11] land of
[52:13] Egypt see they they wanted to be a
[52:16] spiritual group right and even even a
[52:19] part of Jeremiah gets into it because
[52:21] there was a very religious group right
[52:24] they wanted to they burnt their
[52:25] offerings they offered their their sons
[52:28] they burnt their
[52:29] incense see they they were very
[52:32] religious but he said it wasn't he
[52:34] wasn't he wasn't interested when he
[52:36] spoke to the fathers in times past it
[52:38] wasn't all about burnt offerings and
[52:40] sacrifices he said it was about
[52:42] obedience right see that was the whole
[52:45] thing even when you go back to the day
[52:47] of Saul being King see that was the
[52:50] whole thing about that it God was not
[52:52] interested in the burnt offerings right
[52:54] when when Samuel came to Saul and told
[52:56] told him because when he told him to go
[52:58] down there to AAG and to kill
[53:00] everything not to leave anything there
[53:02] was not supposed to be anything left but
[53:04] to utterly destroy
[53:07] it and he said does God have great
[53:10] Delight in burnt offerings and
[53:13] sacrifices what because he said he said
[53:16] that obedience is better than
[53:19] sacrifice because he said he said
[53:22] Disobedience
[53:23] Rebellion is is as of witchcraft
[53:27] and
[53:27] idolatry right he said see to get just
[53:31] to do utterly destroy all of that right
[53:35] because see it was more it was more
[53:37] important to be obedient amen than to be
[53:41] anything
[53:42] else and there he is when he was when he
[53:45] went down there and see then because of
[53:47] what he had done when what Saul had done
[53:51] being disobedient right that's right
[53:56] because he got in his own mind his own
[53:59] counsel his own imagination as Jeremiah
[54:01] was telling them right here see they
[54:03] walked in their own imagination and see
[54:05] because he done that see God told Sam
[54:08] Samuel to tell Saul he said I pulled the
[54:11] Kingdom from you he said you will no
[54:13] longer be king he said because I raised
[54:16] one up who is better than
[54:20] you see there he was and here's here's a
[54:22] little a little man on the back side of
[54:25] the desert watching
[54:27] sheep here's the greatest man in the
[54:29] Kingdom Head and Shoulders taller than
[54:31] anyone else the man that everybody
[54:33] looked up to and he said there's a
[54:35] little Shepherd Boy On The Backs side of
[54:37] the desert who's better than you and see
[54:40] we can come to church and we can be
[54:42] religious but you know what it's
[54:44] sometimes it's just little kids that can
[54:46] be more faithful than us that's
[54:48] right see the thing is is who who's
[54:52] going to be faithful who's going to be
[54:53] obedient to the word come on
[54:57] see because even in Jesus when he when
[54:59] he said in the last days he said they'll
[55:01] come to me and say Lord Lord did we not
[55:03] cast out Devils did we not preach in
[55:05] your name did we not prophesy did we not
[55:07] do all these things and he says depart
[55:10] from me he said I never knew you right
[55:13] he said because you can do a lot of
[55:14] things but he said if you're not
[55:16] obedient to the whole word he said it
[55:18] doesn't mean
[55:19] anything and that's why we have to be
[55:22] obedient amen
[55:29] amen bless he speaks this he's speaking
[55:33] of the sins that they
[55:37] committed he said he said my people have
[55:39] committed two sins
[55:41] y he said they have forsaken me he said
[55:46] the Fountain of Living
[55:53] Water bless
[55:58] this is from broken sisters here y'all
[56:02] just y'all just pray for me bless I'm
[56:08] going I'm gonna get through
[56:11] this he said now a Fountain of Living

[57:08] wind it twist it or or join it it's just
[57:12] a Fountain of Living Waters
[57:16] amen and here it was he said they have
[57:19] forsaken me the Fountain of Living
[57:22] Water can you imagine here he is he's
[57:24] speaking of a fountain
[57:27] that's that's always moving that's
[57:29] always flowing that's always clean and
[57:31] pure you can see this just
[57:34] overflowing just as brother R was
[57:36] speaking of that rock that was in the
[57:38] wilderness here was that rock and he
[57:40] said you know the the artist draw the
[57:41] picture and he said it was like a little
[57:43] cupful that come out of the out of the
[57:45] Rock and he said but that little stream
[57:47] would have never never you know thirst
[57:51] you know quench The Thirst of all of
[57:52] those camels and all of those people he
[57:55] said because it was a gusher he said it
[57:57] was a yes a fountain that was pouring
[57:59] out of that rock and here he is he's
[58:01] speaking I am I'm that Fountain amen not
[58:05] just a little stream not a trickle but a
[58:07] gusher brother ra calls it a Geer you
[58:09] just coming forth pouring out right here
[58:12] it is fresh and clean and pure and so
[58:15] it's not just a little stream but here
[58:17] it comes to pouring
[58:19] out FR in front of the people and he
[58:21] said he said they have forsaken
[58:23] me and he said he said here it is just
[58:26] an overwhelming pouring out of of of who
[58:30] I am before him but he said he said but
[58:34] they have forsaken me and he said
[58:36] they've he them out
[58:37] sisters right broken sisters he said
[58:41] that can hold no
[58:43] water and so you you look here and you
[58:47] know what what is a
[58:50] sister well before we get into that you
[58:53] know you go back to John
[58:56] John
[58:59] 7 and Jesus
[59:01] speaking you know he said he said
[59:04] whoever is a thirst come unto
[59:07] me you know he said I'll let them drink
[59:10] of the Water of Life
[59:13] freely and he said and he said when you
[59:16] drink from me he said out of your
[59:19] bellies shall flow rivers of Living
[59:22] Water see they had the opportunity see
[59:25] that's what that's what they were
[59:26] passing
[59:28] up see it was not it was them drinking
[59:30] in the living water and it coming out of
[59:33] them that they become that that Fountain
[59:36] right and he said they've he them out
[59:38] sisters what is a
[59:43] sister brother says it's a it's a man
[59:46] weigh
[59:50] whale brother yes
[59:53] sir milon
[59:56] cab they have a big big pile of water
[1:00:01] com that's right that's right they had a
[1:00:02] big pile of water coming out I
[1:00:06] mean I mean can you you imagine what is
[1:00:09] that 6 eight cups gallons whatever a
[1:00:15] day try try to imagine that for 2 and a
[1:00:17] half million
[1:00:19] people and a little stream look like
[1:00:21] your water fountain coming out going to
[1:00:24] feed that many people
[1:00:27] brother R says he said a sister it's a
[1:00:30] it's
[1:00:31] a it's a thing dug in the ground to take
[1:00:34] the place of a whale right he said when
[1:00:36] people don't have a whale they get a
[1:00:38] sister in other words a sistern is a
[1:00:40] man-made tank or a manmade whale in the
[1:00:42] ground that man dig out to catch the
[1:00:44] water to use it right they said they use
[1:00:46] it for wash water and drinking water and
[1:00:50] everything he said you used to have an
[1:00:53] old thing you had to wind around and
[1:00:55] around and around to get the water up
[1:00:57] had little buckets on it to pump the
[1:00:58] water out and we notice one thing about
[1:01:01] a sistern that's different from a whale
[1:01:04] he said a sister will get empty the
[1:01:07] sister cannot fill itself right he said
[1:01:09] it's not reliable you can't rely on a
[1:01:12] sister right it has to rely and depend
[1:01:14] upon the rains that fall in the summer
[1:01:16] and the winter whatever it was usually
[1:01:18] in the winter time when the snow and the
[1:01:19] rain comes then it runs the water off
[1:01:21] into the
[1:01:23] sister and brother Rand goes on to talk
[1:01:26] about that when the in the country and
[1:01:29] they would build they would build a
[1:01:31] sistern he said they would attach it to
[1:01:33] the
[1:01:36] barn and he said all of this stuff and
[1:01:39] you know and it so it sounds so
[1:01:42] appealing and I don't know some of you
[1:01:44] some of you know you know some of you
[1:01:46] know know what a sister is cuz we've
[1:01:47] seen it and it's you know it's the most
[1:01:50] appetizing thing you've
[1:01:52] seen but said you know he said they
[1:01:54] attach it to the barn and he said all of
[1:01:56] the animals walking around and all the
[1:01:59] things that they do he said all that
[1:02:00] stuff builds up on top of the
[1:02:03] barn and he said when the rains come he
[1:02:06] said it washes all of that off and it
[1:02:08] goes right into a
[1:02:10] sistern and he said all of that junk is
[1:02:13] right in that
[1:02:14] sister and then he said when when
[1:02:16] they're sitting in that sister then he
[1:02:18] said you know he
[1:02:20] said talk about the bugs and the wiggle
[1:02:22] tails and all that other stuff that
[1:02:24] builds up in that and there it sits and
[1:02:28] you know it just kind of you know you
[1:02:30] know it's a dirty smelly
[1:02:34] mess and I you know you
[1:02:37] know ruin your breakfast this
[1:02:40] morning but you know you look at you
[1:02:42] look at all that and that that that is
[1:02:45] what they went
[1:02:48] for a
[1:02:50] sister and he said you know they try to
[1:02:52] use a rag and they try to cover up the
[1:02:54] end of it to keep it from coming
[1:02:57] out and brother R said he said you might
[1:03:00] keep the bugs in the sister he said but
[1:03:02] you don't keep the juice
[1:03:06] out I what the prophet said but that's
[1:03:09] what happens see but you see the what
[1:03:12] what what they have went
[1:03:14] for and that's what they were doing y
[1:03:18] you see this nasty smelly thing in the
[1:03:21] ground that was
[1:03:24] unreliable he said he said they hidden
[1:03:26] them out and he said they were
[1:03:29] broken he said that can hold no water
[1:03:32] right and brother bom said he said oh
[1:03:34] yeah they might get filled when they had
[1:03:36] a Revival but they couldn't hold
[1:03:38] anything right he said it would go in
[1:03:40] and it would go right back
[1:03:42] out and so they would fill up but it
[1:03:44] don't take long till it's gone and so
[1:03:47] then from the from the previous time
[1:03:49] you've got all of the stuff that's still
[1:03:51] in
[1:03:52] there and then you add more water to it
[1:03:55] then you've got the filth from the last
[1:03:57] time then you've got more filth and then
[1:03:59] you got more filth how are you going to
[1:04:02] ever get you can't ever get the dirt out
[1:04:04] of it it's still just going to stay
[1:04:06] filthy the whole time and it just
[1:04:09] continually gets worse and worse and
[1:04:11] worse but he said that's what they've
[1:04:13] done they've heed them out a
[1:04:16] sistern a mess a water a filth and turn
[1:04:21] down this Pure Clean artisian whale and
[1:04:24] went for a
[1:04:26] a fil right or in other words you can
[1:04:29] call it a Cess
[1:04:30] pool and he said that's what they've
[1:04:32] done right he said they they forsaken me
[1:04:35] and went to a Cess
[1:04:37] pool when when he tried to bring them to
[1:04:41] a place to
[1:04:43] show and all the way through this this
[1:04:46] is the one thing
[1:04:49] that it's the it's the one thought that
[1:04:51] that I can't that I never get out of my
[1:04:53] mind the whole time when I'm when I was
[1:04:54] reading the book of mind and studying
[1:04:56] you keep going back to that
[1:04:58] sister that's where they were at that's
[1:05:01] what they long for was the
[1:05:05] filth and you know the thing is is we we
[1:05:08] get in the same we can get in the same
[1:05:10] condition you know brother Brown talked
[1:05:12] about what was what was the
[1:05:14] sister he said it was a denomination
[1:05:17] right amen he said what was it he said
[1:05:20] it was a
[1:05:21] denomination right and you know what
[1:05:23] it's becomes a denominational idea M
[1:05:26] amen and what happens see see there
[1:05:29] there's there's nothing wrong but the
[1:05:31] problem is is people have put put their
[1:05:33] period and behind what they believe and
[1:05:35] that's it they can't go on any further
[1:05:38] with God because when they got to that
[1:05:40] place then that ended it just like
[1:05:43] brother vam said he said you know God
[1:05:44] moved upon the people and he said they
[1:05:47] had a Revival but he said then they
[1:05:50] decided to stop and he said they
[1:05:51] wouldn't go any further he said he said
[1:05:54] they wouldn't he said they re rejected a
[1:05:56] further impregnation of the word and he
[1:05:58] said when that happened he said go back
[1:06:00] and look and show me he said a
[1:06:02] denomination that ever had a Revival
[1:06:04] that God ever went back to and revived
[1:06:07] and done anything with
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:13] amen and we get in we can get in the
[1:06:15] same condition right
[1:06:19] amen Jeremiah chapter
[1:06:24] 3 Jeremiah speaking he says they say if
[1:06:28] a man put away his wife and she go from
[1:06:31] him and become another man's shall he
[1:06:34] return unto her again shall not that
[1:06:37] land be greatly polluted but thou Hast
[1:06:40] played the Harlot with many lovers yet
[1:06:43] return again to me sayeth the
[1:06:47] Lord lift up mine eyes un the high
[1:06:50] places and see where thou Hast not been
[1:06:55] lean with in the days that thou Hast sat
[1:06:58] for them as the Raven in the wilderness
[1:07:02] and thou has polluted the land with homs
[1:07:04] and with wickedness therefore the
[1:07:05] showers have been withholding and there
[1:07:08] hath been no light or rain for thou Hast
[1:07:11] a horse forehead thou shouldest thou
[1:07:14] should us be ashamed
[1:07:16] right and it goes
[1:07:19] on in verse 7 it says and I said after
[1:07:23] she had done all these things turn turn
[1:07:25] thou unto me but she return returned not
[1:07:29] and her treacherous sister Judah saw it
[1:07:32] and I saw when when for all the causes
[1:07:36] whereby backsliding Israel committed
[1:07:38] adultery I had put her away and given
[1:07:41] her a bill of divorce yet her
[1:07:44] treacherous sister Judah feared not but
[1:07:47] went and played the Harlot
[1:07:49] also so when he's speaking to the people
[1:07:52] of of
[1:07:54] Israel see
[1:07:56] he's calling out and was talking of the
[1:07:58] poll of the
[1:08:01] pollution see when a man put away his
[1:08:05] wife because she played the Harlot he
[1:08:07] wasn't supposed to take her back he
[1:08:09] wasn't supposed to have anything else to
[1:08:10] do with her but you know here he is he's
[1:08:13] calling to
[1:08:14] Israel but see they would not come
[1:08:17] back but you know see it wasn't for a it
[1:08:20] wasn't for a lack of God calling them
[1:08:23] because here he is but he says he said
[1:08:25] you have a for a horse forehead he said
[1:08:28] the the water has been
[1:08:30] withholding right so you go back to to
[1:08:34] the sister a sister that can hold no
[1:08:37] water that's dry because if it can hold
[1:08:40] no water because the water is gone then
[1:08:43] the water is withholding so there is no
[1:08:46] water so here you are you're in a place
[1:08:48] of complete
[1:08:50] dry you're in a drought
[1:08:56] but see he has been but he was calling
[1:08:58] to
[1:08:59] him and see how and it got even worse
[1:09:02] because when he said when Israel was
[1:09:04] doing these things he said Judah saw
[1:09:07] it right and could not see the detriment
[1:09:10] under Israel right but Judah went ahead
[1:09:13] and done the same thing right he said he
[1:09:16] is he's calling unto unto Judah to to
[1:09:19] come back just same as as he did for
[1:09:21] Israel but she would not come but she
[1:09:23] didn't come back either because you know
[1:09:26] what it becomes such a a such a thing
[1:09:30] that's so great that that when other
[1:09:33] people are doing it you know what people
[1:09:34] get roped into it
[1:09:36] also because people try to keep up with
[1:09:38] the Joneses because you know what it
[1:09:40] becomes a spirit and because many times
[1:09:43] we've seen and you go around and look at
[1:09:45] churches and the first thing that
[1:09:47] happens if if a if a minister if a
[1:09:50] pastor compromises on the word on
[1:09:52] anything and you let something come into
[1:09:55] the church and it's not called out and
[1:09:57] it's not
[1:09:58] removed then you wait and see it opens
[1:10:01] the door right and all of a sudden you
[1:10:04] see all kind of Filth come into the
[1:10:06] church because when you compromise on
[1:10:08] the word behind the pull pit when the
[1:10:11] word is compromised on then you open the
[1:10:14] door for everything to come in right and
[1:10:16] it just becomes and it may start out it
[1:10:18] starts out small but you can see how
[1:10:20] things have opened up and the next thing
[1:10:22] you know you have the things that are
[1:10:24] going on in the m message today that's
[1:10:27] right that's right because see as soon
[1:10:29] as soon as you
[1:10:31] compromise and see what you have to be
[1:10:34] careful about that because see the thing
[1:10:36] is is people have built a
[1:10:39] sistern they have built their own
[1:10:41] sistern but you know what it can't hold
[1:10:44] in
[1:10:45] water and what happens is you see all of
[1:10:49] a sudden the next thing you know we have
[1:10:51] all of these doctrines right
[1:10:55] and that's what has happened is people
[1:10:57] have have left the
[1:10:59] word right amen they' not they not quit
[1:11:03] being
[1:11:04] religious
[1:11:07] right but they've they've left the word
[1:11:11] right and that's what is happened we
[1:11:13] have we you know there's no there's no
[1:11:15] lack of religion in the
[1:11:17] world there's a lack of Truth in the
[1:11:19] world
[1:11:21] Amen it's it's the truth that'll set you
[1:11:24] free right not being religious Religion
[1:11:27] Don't Do
[1:11:29] Anything see that's was who was it Jesse
[1:11:33] Ventura the the wrestler whatever then
[1:11:36] he was governor of Minnesota right you
[1:11:38] know he's talking about feeble-minded
[1:11:39] people you know feeble-minded people are
[1:11:41] or you know what was it feebleminded
[1:11:44] people lean on religion or something
[1:11:46] other like that was his was his quote Oh
[1:11:49] My see you know the thing is if it
[1:11:52] wasn't if it wasn't for and and you know
[1:11:54] that's right
[1:11:56] oh my you know I thought about it at
[1:11:58] first I was a little upset you know what
[1:12:00] that's
[1:12:02] right right just just just as the uh the
[1:12:07] poem that brother R quotes about long
[1:12:10] fell you know he said don't be like dumb
[1:12:12] driven
[1:12:13] cattle but you know what people people
[1:12:16] are just like that right so you know the
[1:12:19] thing is are you like are you like a d
[1:12:21] you know are you like dumb driven cattle
[1:12:24] right because you know the thing is is
[1:12:27] they just heard you in One Direction you
[1:12:28] don't have any idea where you're going
[1:12:31] there's nobody out in front of
[1:12:33] you you know someone said one time he
[1:12:36] said are you like dumb driven cattle or
[1:12:38] he said are you like
[1:12:39] sheep sheep are lad you know the
[1:12:42] shepherd's not behind the Sheep right
[1:12:46] The Shepherd's in front of the sheep
[1:12:48] that's right the she because the sheep
[1:12:51] have their eye on the shepherd CLE ain't
[1:12:53] that way
[1:12:55] they just kind of push them this way and
[1:12:56] they go this way and that way and you
[1:12:58] got to go get them out of the weeds and
[1:12:59] and you know the gullies and everywhere
[1:13:01] else why because they go every direction
[1:13:03] you're just trying to push them in One
[1:13:05] Direction but you know brother I'm
[1:13:07] talking about that sheep that sheep
[1:13:09] having his eye on the shepherd He said
[1:13:12] wherever that Shepherd went he said that
[1:13:14] sheep
[1:13:15] went he said you know when they went
[1:13:17] through that one that market when he was
[1:13:19] overseas and he said you know he said
[1:13:20] you look at them he said you know they
[1:13:23] thought it you know brother thought it
[1:13:24] was going to be pandon him there thought
[1:13:26] going to be all kind of Destruction he
[1:13:28] said they might have looked at that
[1:13:30] fruit and those vegetables and those
[1:13:31] things he said but they didn't touch it
[1:13:33] he said because they had their eye on
[1:13:35] the shepherd He said they went the same
[1:13:36] way the shepherd went they walked in his
[1:13:40] footsteps and so that's the way we have
[1:13:42] to be can you know if if that's the way
[1:13:45] you know if if you want to be like him
[1:13:48] then you've got to walk like
[1:13:50] him because are we are we going to walk
[1:13:55] the way that he walked
[1:14:04] right I don't think I ever gave you the
[1:14:06] title of this
[1:14:08] sermon but my the title this after I got
[1:14:11] this so this
[1:14:13] far is is entitled
[1:14:16] Disobedience leads to a broken sister
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:22] right that's what led to their the
[1:14:24] broken sister right that's right was
[1:14:27] their
[1:14:29] Disobedience and that's that was all the
[1:14:31] way through the scripture that's all God
[1:14:33] was looking for was their obedience
[1:14:36] right he he was referring to them to
[1:14:38] come back
[1:14:41] amen you know he was
[1:14:44] faithful and he kept referring back to
[1:14:47] the
[1:14:49] promises
[1:14:51] and this is from broken sister in 1964
[1:15:02] 5 he said and Israel found the same
[1:15:04] thing as examples in their Journey to
[1:15:06] the promised land he said the tanks were
[1:15:09] all dry yeah journey in obedience to his
[1:15:12] Promised Land the journey and the tanks
[1:15:15] they found
[1:15:16] dry now they found the tanks could not
[1:15:20] be depended on for the journey and he
[1:15:22] said if you're going to journey in
[1:15:23] obedience to the word of God and try to
[1:15:26] join this and that you're going to find
[1:15:28] out there ain't a tank in the world that
[1:15:30] will support it not at all you are an
[1:15:33] individual and God leads you just this
[1:15:35] the way he wants to lead you then we
[1:15:37] have found the same thing today all the
[1:15:40] tanks are dried
[1:15:43] up and God wants us see it's a journey
[1:15:47] and it's a journey and I I love that
[1:15:49] journey in
[1:15:50] obedience it was that was their that was
[1:15:52] their journey and it was in Journey in
[1:15:55] obedience right that's that was the
[1:15:56] whole thing right to find out if they
[1:15:59] were going to if they would be obedient
[1:16:01] or not right and so here they go all the
[1:16:05] way
[1:16:06] through and here and you know he keeps
[1:16:08] referring back
[1:16:11] to the
[1:16:13] fathers right referring and here they
[1:16:15] are going back and looking and showing
[1:16:18] them hey your fathers y I done this for
[1:16:22] them y I done that for them amen and he
[1:16:25] said you know they were the ones that
[1:16:26] walked away from me he said they failed
[1:16:28] me right but you know what God when they
[1:16:32] failed God he still went on with them
[1:16:34] said to keep going to keep going he
[1:16:37] suffered with them was
[1:16:40] longsuffering see an amazing thing what
[1:16:43] you know because you know how how we are
[1:16:47] we can be short with
[1:16:49] people and we can we get sometimes we
[1:16:51] want to write people off but you know
[1:16:54] what here is he he wanted to keep going
[1:16:56] with them and still had that promise
[1:16:58] until they turned him down for the
[1:17:00] kadish barell when it was time to go in
[1:17:03] they didn't want to go amen see God will
[1:17:06] will you know he will go with you for so
[1:17:08] long but there comes a time that you've
[1:17:10] got to walk with him right that you've
[1:17:12] got that you've got to go further than
[1:17:14] than we've went
[1:17:17] right and you you go back and and look
[1:17:20] there's there's many
[1:17:23] things that that you look at
[1:17:26] Jeremiah and there some things I wanted
[1:17:28] to get into but just touch on them you
[1:17:30] know you you you look at you look at
[1:17:33] Jeremiah and here's Jeremiah going out
[1:17:36] daily and standing before the people and
[1:17:39] and speaking to them and trying to bring
[1:17:41] them back and in uh chapter I believe
[1:17:45] it's chapter 20
[1:17:47] there verse
[1:17:49] 8 he says for since I spake I cried not
[1:17:54] I cried out I cried violence and spool
[1:17:56] because the word of the Lord was made a
[1:17:59] reproach unto me and a derision
[1:18:02] daily it was a reproach unto him because
[1:18:07] see he was the only one standing out
[1:18:09] there front of all these people trying
[1:18:11] to prove what was truth and he said it
[1:18:13] was a derision it was because the word
[1:18:16] the word was contempt before the people
[1:18:19] there was contempt for it there was
[1:18:21] contempt for him and and brother and
[1:18:26] Jeremiah goes on to say and then I said
[1:18:28] I will not make mention of him nor speak
[1:18:31] anymore in his name but it was but his
[1:18:34] word was in my heart as a burning fire
[1:18:37] shut up in my bones and I was weary with
[1:18:39] forbearing and could not stay
[1:18:44] right what an amazing thing that that
[1:18:46] Jeremiah got tired of it it was it was
[1:18:50] weary to him it wore him down but you
[1:18:54] know what he stood there and he said
[1:18:55] yeah but it was like he said when I
[1:18:57] could not when I would not mention him
[1:18:58] when I would not do this he said it was
[1:19:00] like fire shut up in my bones amen
[1:19:04] sometimes I wonder if we have that
[1:19:06] sometimes I say Lord where is that in me
[1:19:08] come
[1:19:10] on that that we would have that we would
[1:19:12] have that
[1:19:13] desire sometimes sometimes one because
[1:19:15] we get we get
[1:19:17] weak and you know we we're scared
[1:19:20] sometimes because we don't you know and
[1:19:22] the other thing is like people ask me
[1:19:24] say why why don't you say why don't you
[1:19:25] say something about this or something
[1:19:26] about that like the best thing for me to
[1:19:28] do is wait on the Lord if the Lord don't
[1:19:29] give me anything to say to people then I
[1:19:31] don't say anything but the problem is
[1:19:32] that sometimes we know the Lord has
[1:19:34] spoke to us to tell somebody something
[1:19:36] or say something to people but you know
[1:19:38] what we don't say it
[1:19:40] right but you know the thing is here
[1:19:43] here here you you can imagine the all of
[1:19:45] the all the things that Jeremiah Was
[1:19:46] facing but here is in the chapter one
[1:19:49] and
[1:19:51] and God speaking to Jeremiah says Thou
[1:19:54] therefore bur up thy loins and arise and
[1:19:57] speak unto them that I that I command
[1:20:01] thee be not dismayed at their faces lest
[1:20:05] I confound thee thee before
[1:20:08] them now listen to this this is Chap 1:8
[1:20:12] says for behold I have made thee this
[1:20:15] day a defensed city and an iron pillar
[1:20:19] and Brazen walls against the whole land
[1:20:21] against the kings of Judah against the
[1:20:23] princes thereof against the priest
[1:20:25] thereof and against the people of the
[1:20:29] land see when all of that was going on
[1:20:31] and all that Jeremiah had to face but
[1:20:34] God made him a promise Jeremiah told God
[1:20:37] told Jeremiah said listen he said you're
[1:20:39] like a defense
[1:20:40] City see when all the things had come
[1:20:43] against
[1:20:44] him the Kings the the princes all the
[1:20:49] religious realm everybody was against
[1:20:52] him and yet God told him said you're
[1:20:55] defensed you're
[1:20:58] protected see here he was he said you
[1:21:00] just go out there and
[1:21:02] speak because he he he was God longed to
[1:21:05] bring them back into fellowship and he
[1:21:08] said look he said you're
[1:21:11] protected see sometimes we forget who we
[1:21:15] serve that that we are that we are
[1:21:17] protected that that we are covered see
[1:21:20] we we have that
[1:21:22] protection see because you know he said
[1:21:25] he said if if one Falls at your right
[1:21:26] side you know at your left hand he said
[1:21:28] but no it won't come n thee he said the
[1:21:31] angels of God are encamped about those
[1:21:33] that fear Him see if you're encamped
[1:21:35] about then see the thing is is you're
[1:21:38] defensed you have a
[1:21:40] defense see the thing is that I'm so
[1:21:42] thankful that I have one that even when
[1:21:44] I don't know what's going on he does
[1:21:46] that that he covers me because I can you
[1:21:48] know there's things that happen in my
[1:21:50] life that if I didn't have him I you
[1:21:52] know you don't know what can happen
[1:21:53] because you can't move you can't get out
[1:21:55] of the way but you know what he can take
[1:21:57] care of
[1:22:01] you and then we then you
[1:22:04] know Jeremiah he keeps coming back and
[1:22:06] he keeps bringing these things and you
[1:22:08] know God keeps speaking to Jeremiah and
[1:22:10] he's bringing these these things out and
[1:22:12] he keeps bringing them back and he's
[1:22:14] telling the
[1:22:16] people and one of the other things that
[1:22:18] he talks about
[1:22:20] is he takes him to The Potter's House
[1:22:26] and when he goes down to The Potter's
[1:22:27] House you know he sees he sees the
[1:22:29] Potter with the with the
[1:22:31] clay and he has the power over to make
[1:22:34] it
[1:22:35] anyway and when it doesn't turn out
[1:22:37] right he start it
[1:22:40] over he didn't throw the He Didn't Throw
[1:22:42] the Clay Away he just took them all and
[1:22:44] broke it and crushed it and was able to
[1:22:48] start again and mold it again right he
[1:22:51] said see do I not have power over the mo
[1:22:53] over the clay to mold it into in any way
[1:22:56] that I want it to be and so here it is
[1:22:59] he was molding that clay into into his
[1:23:02] fashion that that he wanted it to be and
[1:23:06] say see the way it is with you and I we
[1:23:07] can we can be molded into that into His
[1:23:12] Image see the thing is is do do we allow
[1:23:16] God to do that to us that that he can
[1:23:18] mold us right into His Image but it
[1:23:21] takes him you can't do it yourself you
[1:23:24] have to ow him to do
[1:23:26] it
[1:23:31] and and then we know that Jeremiah
[1:23:34] also Jeremiah also was
[1:23:37] given the
[1:23:39] prophecy of the 70 years in in
[1:23:43] Babylon you know the thing is is Isaiah
[1:23:45] Isaiah spoke to the children of Israel
[1:23:47] because it was the king of Assyria that
[1:23:49] was coming to take them over and they
[1:23:52] should have went into bondage then but
[1:23:54] you know the people repented and came
[1:23:57] back in line and they didn't
[1:24:00] fall but you know the thing is is there
[1:24:02] came a time that Jeremiah was up and he
[1:24:05] prophesied before the people and he come
[1:24:07] to the point where he starts speaking in
[1:24:09] past
[1:24:10] tense because he had spoke to the people
[1:24:14] and realized that they were going to go
[1:24:15] into bondage anyway they were not going
[1:24:18] they were not going to repent so in the
[1:24:22] prophecies he speaks in he speaks in the
[1:24:23] past tense because he realized this is
[1:24:25] what's going to take place they were
[1:24:27] going into the bondage
[1:24:29] right but but see the other thing is he
[1:24:32] says in the end he knows there's a
[1:24:36] restoration coming sure amen he said
[1:24:38] they've went into bondage and he's
[1:24:40] speaking in past tense and they not even
[1:24:42] went into bondage yet but he stands up
[1:24:44] and he gives the word that there's a
[1:24:46] restoration there amen and so see that's
[1:24:48] what we have today we have a word of
[1:24:50] restoration am we have been giving the
[1:24:53] word of restoration
[1:24:55] brother BR brother BR tells us anything
[1:24:57] anything outside the word of outside of
[1:24:59] Jesus Christ in the word of life he said
[1:25:01] it's a broken sister right he said
[1:25:03] whatever that you have and he said even
[1:25:05] the things that we do in this life even
[1:25:09] our hopes and things that that we put
[1:25:12] our put our time and our abilities in he
[1:25:15] said they broken
[1:25:17] sisters he said because the thing is he
[1:25:19] said that you put your time and effort
[1:25:21] into things and he said you'll never get
[1:25:23] anything out of it he said it just it
[1:25:25] sucks the life right out of you sucks
[1:25:27] your time and everything right out of
[1:25:29] you and there's no profit to it see it's
[1:25:32] just as Jeremiah was speaking here he
[1:25:33] said what is the prophit does it pro
[1:25:36] what do you get anything back out of it
[1:25:38] that you put into it is it just sucking
[1:25:41] it right out of you do you are you
[1:25:43] reaping anything from it
[1:25:45] right and many times people have that's
[1:25:48] what has tied up their whole life in
[1:25:51] things and there's no benefit to it
[1:25:53] right men right they've not they've not
[1:25:56] reaped anything amen but see that's what
[1:26:00] we have today we
[1:26:02] have see you can't ever outg give God
[1:26:07] there's nothing that you can't do do
[1:26:09] with you know because this is the
[1:26:11] greatest thing
[1:26:12] because you know the scripture tells us
[1:26:14] he said it's it's a
[1:26:16] 30-fold a 60-fold a 100
[1:26:20] fold see you can't you can't get that
[1:26:23] kind of deance for me anybody right
[1:26:25] there no there's no financial
[1:26:27] institution in the world give you that
[1:26:28] kind of
[1:26:30] deal but here it is you know brother R
[1:26:33] said he said you seow one little seed
[1:26:37] and he said you'll reap a wash tub
[1:26:40] full right what an amazing thing now I
[1:26:44] know I know brother talking about you
[1:26:45] know we we SE things things of the Flesh
[1:26:48] and he said it comes back to you know we
[1:26:50] reap a whole Wash Tub full but I believe
[1:26:52] it's the same way in in in the in the
[1:26:55] things that are right and
[1:26:57] real because God because he said you
[1:27:00] know you know try me and see if I don't
[1:27:02] open up the windows of heaven and pour
[1:27:05] you out a blessing that you cannot
[1:27:06] contain but see the thing is is you've
[1:27:08] got a try amen but see the thing is is
[1:27:12] God calls us and you know it's it's so
[1:27:15] amazing God wants us just to be
[1:27:20] obedient if we can be obedient
[1:27:26] and we see people people
[1:27:29] have gotten away from
[1:27:32] things just as just as brother R
[1:27:35] speaking of of
[1:27:37] Eve Eve didn't
[1:27:39] wait right he got ahead of God right he
[1:27:43] said Sarah got ahead of God right there
[1:27:46] was a plan and a purpose but but they
[1:27:49] but they were ahead of of the plan right
[1:27:52] and they and they brought
[1:27:55] death right and destruction and
[1:27:58] heartache
[1:28:00] right and we do the same thing amen
[1:28:03] right because see the thing is is it
[1:28:05] takes the it takes the
[1:28:07] word to have life and to have it more
[1:28:11] abundant it takes the word but the thing
[1:28:14] is is you've got to wait on
[1:28:16] God because people people have gotten a
[1:28:19] thought from God and you know that but
[1:28:22] if you don't hold it before God God and
[1:28:25] it's got to become a revelation right
[1:28:28] and see that's what that's what happened
[1:28:30] to a lot of
[1:28:31] people because see people hear a lot of
[1:28:35] things and they see a lot of things but
[1:28:38] you know what it's got to become a
[1:28:39] revelation right if people because see
[1:28:44] you just like brother R was talking
[1:28:46] about you know I I don't believe I don't
[1:28:48] believe people start out to be bad right
[1:28:50] right he said even talking about the
[1:28:52] Catholics he when they go to you know
[1:28:55] and the in the nuns going to the
[1:28:57] monasteries and and everything the
[1:28:59] convents and everything like that he
[1:29:00] said they don't do that to be bad he
[1:29:03] said they do that because they're
[1:29:04] they're TR they have a desire right but
[1:29:07] the problem is is is when you when you
[1:29:10] see people today they've not held
[1:29:13] on because if you're not going to hold
[1:29:15] on before God and let him lead
[1:29:18] you it's got to be you've got to be led
[1:29:21] by him right not if we try to do
[1:29:23] anything ourselves it's a miserable
[1:29:25] failure but see that's what's happened
[1:29:27] to a lot of people and that's the reason
[1:29:29] that things have happened the way that
[1:29:31] they are today is people have not held
[1:29:33] on and stood and just waited on God
[1:29:37] right and if we can just wait on God he
[1:29:40] can mold us and make us into His Image
[1:29:43] into what he wants us to be
[1:29:45] right and that's what that's that's what
[1:29:48] I have this morning for
[1:29:49] you because that that's that's what's on
[1:29:52] my heart amen we need to be obedient
[1:29:56] amen God God help us to be obedient to
[1:29:59] the
[1:30:01] word many times we you
[1:30:04] know are you drinking from a sister this

[1:30:12] artisian whale come

[1:30:19] artisian whale

[1:30:25] idea or is it really a whale right is it
[1:30:29] really A whale that's springing
[1:30:32] up because many times people people have
[1:30:35] just they have an illusion they have an
[1:30:38] idea but it's not but it's not real it's
[1:30:42] a
[1:30:43] mirage
