[18:21] amen
[18:22] hebrews chapter 11 verse 30 says by
[18:26] faith the walls of jericho fell down
[18:28] after they were compassed about seven
[18:31] days
[18:32] by faith the harlot rahab perished not
[18:34] with them that believed not
[18:36] when she had received the spies
[18:39] with peace
[18:41] amen god bless you this morning be
[18:42] seated
[18:45] and
[18:46] i titled this a true token
[18:50] and
[18:55] in
[18:56] joshua chapter 2 as we'll we'll get here
[18:58] in a minute
[18:59] in verse in verse 12
[19:02] when rahab is speaking to the spies
[19:05] she says give me a true token
[19:09] and that's where our title comes from
[19:13] a token
[19:15] you know brother rem tells us that a
[19:17] token is is something that shows that
[19:19] affair has been paid it's a sign
[19:23] and the the dictionary says something
[19:26] token means something serving to
[19:27] represent or indicates some fact event
[19:30] feeling etc a sign
[19:33] a characteristic indication or mark of
[19:35] something
[19:36] it's an evidence or proof
[19:40] and so we want to speak about a true
[19:43] token
[19:46] and
[19:47] beginning here in joshua chapter 2
[19:50] beginning with verse 1 says
[19:52] and joshua the son of nun sent out
[19:55] of him to men
[19:59] to spy secretly saying go view the land
[20:01] even jericho and they went and came into
[20:03] a harlot's house named rahab
[20:06] and lodged there
[20:08] now brother branham says in the message
[20:10] perseverance
[20:13] i'm sorry
[20:15] i'm sorry why little bethlehem here
[20:18] and it says uh
[20:21] he said we find out also
[20:24] it became the home of the harlot rahab
[20:26] when israel had passed over the border
[20:28] line of the jordan river into palestine
[20:31] we are acquainted with the story of
[20:32] rahab the harlot hey let's picture her
[20:34] this morning a few minutes as a young
[20:36] lady a beautiful young woman who some
[20:39] misfortune in life had forced her in
[20:41] being a pagan had forced her into the
[20:43] life that she was living and many times
[20:45] people are forced into the life
[20:47] that they live
[20:50] and so you know we see things that and
[20:52] you know brother rem says that we don't
[20:54] even history tells us we don't know a
[20:55] lot about the life of rahab but we do
[20:58] know one thing about it that she was a
[21:00] believer
[21:03] and we know that you know she's a she
[21:05] was a gentile
[21:08] which was an outcast
[21:11] here she was one of the lowest forms
[21:14] in society
[21:18] but
[21:19] and and all of that she still believed
[21:22] what she had heard
[21:26] so she she had she had a something that
[21:29] she believed in what she had heard
[21:33] now
[21:34] one of the things i want to look at this
[21:36] morning we're going to go through this
[21:38] this chapter here in and in the book of
[21:40] joshua
[21:43] and picking up verse 2 here
[21:46] continuing on
[21:49] and it says and it was told the king of
[21:52] jericho saying behold there came in men
[21:54] in hither tonight of the children of
[21:57] israel to watch out the country
[21:59] and the king of jericho sent unto rahab
[22:01] saying bring forth the men that are come
[22:04] un come to thee which are entered into
[22:06] thine house for they become to search
[22:08] out all the country
[22:11] and the woman took the two men and hid
[22:13] them and said thus
[22:15] there came men unto me but which
[22:19] not once they were
[22:21] and it came to pass
[22:22] about the time of the shedding of the
[22:24] gate when it was dark that the men went
[22:26] out wither
[22:27] the men went
[22:29] i will not pursue after them quickly
[22:32] for ye shall overtake them
[22:34] but she had brought them up into the
[22:36] roof of the house and hid them
[22:38] with the stalks of flax which she had
[22:40] laid in order upon the roof
[22:44] and the and the men pursued after them
[22:47] the way to jordan under the fords and as
[22:50] soon as they which pursued after them
[22:52] were gone out they shut
[22:55] the gate
[22:56] and before they were hit before they
[22:59] were laid down she came up
[23:01] upon
[23:02] up to them
[23:04] upon the roof
[23:08] now it's interesting
[23:09] when we look at the scripture here
[23:14] here here they are they they come in and
[23:16] joshua has sent the spies in to spy out
[23:18] the land
[23:21] and so as they come in to smile the land
[23:24] the first person they come to is rahab
[23:27] you know the scripture
[23:30] tells us
[23:31] brother brown tells us that
[23:33] you know
[23:34] god always comes to the predestinated
[23:36] seed
[23:38] and here she here they come they come to
[23:40] her
[23:42] and she hides them
[23:45] in the house
[23:46] and she and she hides them
[23:49] and you know she tells them that the men
[23:51] have gone
[23:52] she didn't know they were spies she said
[23:53] just come in but she left
[23:55] but in as we continue on here in the in
[23:57] the scripture as we begin to read we
[23:59] find out that in the scripture reading
[24:03] you know that
[24:04] they begin to tell her who they were and
[24:06] she recognizes who they are
[24:09] but the one thing about rahab is she
[24:11] testifies to what she believes
[24:14] what she sees and what she knows
[24:18] and so we see that in the scripture they
[24:20] begin to they begin to talk about these
[24:22] things and
[24:24] you know
[24:26] she realized
[24:28] by
[24:29] the situation
[24:31] that was going on she realized what she
[24:33] was under
[24:37] because by her own testimony as we as
[24:39] we'll read here in a minute you know
[24:42] her testimony she realized the condition
[24:44] that she was in
[24:46] but she had but she knew what she where
[24:48] she wanted to be what she wanted to take
[24:51] what to take place
[24:52] because when she when she begins to hear
[24:54] in the scripture
[25:00] in verse 9
[25:02] she said
[25:03] and she said unto the men i know that
[25:05] the lord hath given you the land
[25:08] that your terror has fallen upon us and
[25:11] that all the inhabitants of the land
[25:13] faint because of you
[25:15] for we have heard how the lord dried up
[25:18] the water of the red sea for you
[25:20] when you came out of egypt and what ye
[25:23] did unto the two kings of the amorites
[25:26] that were on the other side of jordan
[25:28] saihon and og
[25:30] whom ye utterly destroyed
[25:33] and he said and as soon as
[25:36] and as soon as we had heard these things
[25:39] our
[25:40] hearts did melt
[25:43] neither did there remain any more
[25:45] courage in any man because of you for
[25:48] the lord your god he is god in heaven
[25:51] above and in earth beneath
[25:54] so when when they come in she realizes
[25:56] who they are and she takes them in
[25:59] and then she begins when they when she
[26:01] finds out who they are because of what
[26:03] she had heard
[26:05] faith comes by hearing
[26:07] and hearing by the word of god and but
[26:10] she when she heard these things then she
[26:12] began to tell them
[26:14] hey we got no you know we realized that
[26:16] there's no fight
[26:19] she realized that because of what was
[26:21] going to take place because of what god
[26:23] had done
[26:26] when when god had called the children of
[26:29] israel out of egypt when he called them
[26:32] out
[26:33] and he brand again to bring them in the
[26:35] way to the promised land a promise that
[26:39] had been promised many years before but
[26:42] he had promised abraham that they would
[26:43] come into that land
[26:45] and when they began to walk toward that
[26:47] land then
[26:48] you know it wasn't it wasn't going to be
[26:50] just an easy cakewalk that they were
[26:52] just gonna walk into the land
[26:54] but you know what god was going to prove
[26:56] who he was
[26:58] he promised to bring them into the land
[27:00] but you know he was going to bring him
[27:02] all the way
[27:03] and he wanted them to realize that he
[27:04] was the one that was doing it not them
[27:07] and as he began to bring them along the
[27:09] way then all of a sudden the kings
[27:11] rose up and they just said we just want
[27:13] to pass through the part of your land
[27:15] we're just trying to get to the promised
[27:17] land we're trying to get into canaan
[27:19] and they're like no you're not passing
[27:20] through our lane and they began to stand
[27:23] against them
[27:25] one of them actually came out to fight
[27:27] to resist the children of israel
[27:30] and you know they were they were trying
[27:32] to be as peaceful as they could but you
[27:33] know what they got into god's way
[27:35] because god's way was going in and when
[27:38] they got in the way of god's plan then
[27:40] guess what they were utterly destroyed
[27:42] and they just kept so they just kept
[27:44] moving forward
[27:46] and then when when they begin to speak
[27:47] of these things then when
[27:49] rahab begins to tell the spies
[27:52] listen we've heard what your god can do
[27:55] we've seen those things because we know
[27:57] now
[27:58] amazingly when you when you go back and
[28:00] look when rahabs begins to speak of this
[28:03] you've got to think that
[28:05] here they are under bondage to the
[28:07] greatest army to the greatest world
[28:09] power at the present time
[28:13] and here they are bound by the by egypt
[28:16] by the pharaoh
[28:18] almost i mean people worship the pharaoh
[28:21] as a god
[28:24] you got to think of what kind of of a
[28:26] presence this man has what kind what
[28:28] kind of authority this man has
[28:32] and yet moses goes before him and tells
[28:35] him let my people go
[28:38] he didn't have any respect why because
[28:40] he had respect to the word of god
[28:43] but when they came out and then
[28:44] pharaoh's like you know
[28:46] i'm coming after you
[28:48] after he tells them to leave that he's
[28:50] after him
[28:51] he come out to destroy them
[28:54] but the problem is is god calls one to
[28:56] walk a certain way but he doesn't call
[28:58] everybody to walk that way
[29:00] why because you know the way that
[29:02] brought them out was the way of
[29:03] destruction for the for the egyptian
[29:06] army
[29:07] and so here they are walking across in
[29:09] dry land when the red sea parted and it
[29:12] was you know not just some some
[29:14] fable or some story but it was actually
[29:16] a miracle of god
[29:19] because you know i believe i believe
[29:21] that that took place just as sure as i'm
[29:23] standing here this morning
[29:25] why because he's the same yesterday
[29:27] today and forever if god's ever done
[29:29] anything then he'll always do the same
[29:30] thing and he's still capable this
[29:32] morning of bringing whatever you have
[29:34] need he can still work miracles the
[29:37] problem is he's looking for somebody
[29:39] that'll actually believe him and will
[29:41] actually commit and stand up and claim
[29:43] what's theirs and ask
[29:45] he said ask that your joy might be full
[29:47] but the problem is is we get in our way
[29:50] of god working
[29:56] so here they are when when god calls and
[29:58] he tells moses moses
[30:00] just speak
[30:02] when moses lord what are we going to do
[30:04] we're here at the red sea we got an army
[30:05] behind us where we going now
[30:09] what was it god called give him a
[30:11] commission of where to go just go
[30:13] forward moses
[30:15] when you went to when you stood out
[30:17] there when i told you to go beside the
[30:19] nile and curse the waters and it turned
[30:22] to blood what did you do you just spoke
[30:25] it was just you speaking when you stood
[30:27] up there and you raised your rod and you
[30:29] called for the fleas and the flies the
[30:31] lice and the frogs what did you do you
[30:34] just spoke the word and the word come to
[30:36] pass now what is it when you come before
[30:39] this great red sea
[30:40] when you're standing there before this
[30:42] water that you look it's it's so
[30:44] uncrosstable what do you do just speak
[30:48] why because you've been commissioned
[30:51] you've been commissioned to do something
[30:52] just speak the word and go forward
[30:56] like he was like why are you crying to
[30:58] me
[30:59] why because you've seen me work up till
[31:01] now all the things that i've done just
[31:03] speak yes
[31:05] and so moses spoke the word and the
[31:07] waters parted and they crossed on dry
[31:08] land
[31:10] and all of a sudden when they cross over
[31:12] that land here they are going
[31:16] going toward the promised land
[31:18] and all of a sudden then here comes
[31:20] pharaoh in his army they're coming after
[31:22] them they think they're going to take
[31:23] over take them
[31:26] but let me tell you you can't walk if
[31:28] you're not walking the right with god
[31:29] you know what you're not going to walk
[31:30] the same path
[31:32] that's right brother you can't you can't
[31:34] walk this way amen
[31:37] if it it's it's a true walk with god you
[31:40] gotta be totally sold out surrendered to
[31:42] god if you're gonna come over
[31:46] and so here they are as they cross over
[31:48] then we see that the
[31:49] egypt
[31:50] egyptian army was destroyed
[31:53] here they are destroyed in this flood
[31:56] and the water because
[32:00] they were not called to walk that way
[32:04] and here they are every time that they
[32:05] have an opposition
[32:07] a a problem arises then every single
[32:10] time as they face that obstacle god
[32:12] brings them through
[32:14] and here's rahab standing here and
[32:16] saying you know what we've not even seen
[32:18] y'all
[32:20] we've not seen y'all but you know what
[32:22] we've just heard y'all
[32:23] we've heard about y'all
[32:26] so here it is as we stand here we heard
[32:29] how you because you know what when you
[32:31] got the greatest army in the world
[32:34] when you're sitting here looking at the
[32:35] greatest army in the world with the
[32:36] greatest world power and all of a sudden
[32:39] they don't have an army anymore that
[32:41] makes front page news
[32:44] it's all of a sudden you know then here
[32:45] they are everybody else knows egyptians
[32:48] don't have an army anymore
[32:50] they don't have any chariots anymore
[32:53] they're all in the bottom of the red sea
[32:59] that makes news for everybody
[33:02] then the other two world powers that
[33:05] don't don't believe
[33:07] because you know what if if i saw
[33:10] pharaoh's army
[33:11] and you know and they got destroyed you
[33:14] know what if i was if i was the kings of
[33:16] the amorites you know what i would just
[33:18] say ride this way
[33:20] i wouldn't waste my time
[33:24] but you know what he didn't stop sign
[33:25] haunting
[33:26] they decided hey we're going to get in
[33:28] front of you we want to oppose you why
[33:30] because they were under the judgment of
[33:33] god
[33:35] so they read
[33:41] so when
[33:42] rahab stood there and realized you know
[33:44] she's under judgment
[33:47] because she's in jericho
[33:49] and jericho is under because they're
[33:51] going because they're going to utterly
[33:53] destroy everything that's in that
[33:55] promised land
[33:57] and she's beginning they're speaking to
[33:58] the pro to the to the spies listen we've
[34:00] heard what god has done
[34:04] and she's like i want to be on the right
[34:06] side because i realize what your god's
[34:08] going to do
[34:09] what your god can do and i want to be on
[34:12] the right side yeah i won't i want i
[34:15] want to cry out for mercy
[34:18] i want to be spared
[34:21] so what can i what can i do
[34:24] she had heard of those things
[34:27] it wasn't just just some idea or
[34:29] theology or anything like that she saw
[34:31] something that was real
[34:35] not being not being a pagan and and
[34:36] having some idol made of wood or of gold
[34:39] or something like that but actually
[34:41] knowing there's a true living god that
[34:43] can move
[34:45] that can come on the scene and move and
[34:47] she's like this is what i want
[34:50] i want i want this god to be
[34:53] to lead me
[34:58] verse 12 says now therefore i pray you
[35:01] swear unto me by the lord since i have
[35:04] showed kindness you kindness that you
[35:07] will also show kindness under my
[35:09] father's house and give me a true token
[35:13] and that ye will save
[35:16] a lot of my father and my mother and my
[35:18] brethren and my sisters and all that
[35:21] they have and deliver our lives from
[35:23] death
[35:25] and the men answered her our life for
[35:27] yours if you utter not this our business
[35:30] and it shall be when the lord hath given
[35:33] us the land
[35:35] that we will deal kindly and truly with
[35:38] thee
[35:39] then
[35:40] did she let them down by a cord through
[35:42] the window for her house was upon the
[35:44] town wall
[35:46] and she dwelt upon the wall
[35:51] so we know that
[35:53] as she made the
[35:55] commandment and they give her a token a
[35:58] sign of what would take place
[36:02] and then she allowed them to help them
[36:05] escape
[36:09] and she said unto them go you to the
[36:11] mountain lest the pursuers meet you and
[36:14] hide yourselves there three days until
[36:16] the pursuers be returned and afterward
[36:18] may you go your way and the men said
[36:20] unto her
[36:22] we will be blameless of this done oath
[36:25] which thou hast
[36:27] made a swayer
[36:30] said behold when we come into the land
[36:33] thou shalt bind this
[36:35] line of scarlet thread in the window
[36:37] which thou just led us down by and thou
[36:40] shalt bring thy father and thy mother
[36:42] and thy brethren and all the father's
[36:44] household
[36:46] home
[36:47] unto thee so she was given a commission
[36:50] of what she was supposed to do
[36:53] she was given a sign
[36:56] now this is this is from this is from
[36:58] the great warrior
[37:00] joshua and brother random speaking
[37:03] and he's speaking of joshua
[37:07] coming in
[37:09] and he says he said now we're going to
[37:11] see what the land looks like
[37:14] so he sent out the spies they went and
[37:16] the harlot rahab seen them through the
[37:19] night i want you to notice another thing
[37:21] watch what taken place when they were up
[37:24] here
[37:25] harlot rahab's house harlot rahab she
[37:27] had hid them up under the flanks of the
[37:29] top of the roof sent the men out of the
[37:31] gates and come back said look now god
[37:33] now watch how gods are moving take this
[37:36] encouragement back to joshua
[37:38] he said all this country faith because
[37:41] of you
[37:42] said we have heard what the lord has
[37:43] done for you amen i just love that don't
[37:46] you worry god's got a good time coming
[37:49] by and by
[37:50] all the country is afraid of you when
[37:52] you when we heard that the lord dried up
[37:55] the red sea and let you cross drown
[37:57] pharaoh's army give you food by manna
[38:00] out of out in the wilderness put up a
[38:02] brass serpent up for an atonement he
[38:05] done all these things for you
[38:07] and i know what you've done
[38:09] destroyed the og and the other kings i
[38:12] see what you did utterly destroyed and
[38:15] when we heard this and you were headed
[38:17] our way we just fainted
[38:21] there's no more courage left in no one
[38:25] why because god had done these things
[38:28] and they began to see the condition that
[38:30] they were in and they began to faint
[38:33] why because and it's just like as the
[38:35] world is today we see everybody begins
[38:37] to faint of the condition that the world
[38:39] is in today
[38:40] there's only one place there's only one
[38:42] sure foundation you're going to stand
[38:44] and that's in jesus christ
[38:46] on christ the solid rock i stand all
[38:50] other ground is sinking sand there's no
[38:52] other place to stand they said but they
[38:54] saw what had taken they'd heard these
[38:56] things they said we just we just fainted
[38:58] we just melted there's no there's no
[39:00] courage there's no strength in any of us
[39:04] said when they come back and told that
[39:06] to joshua
[39:07] he said i can imagine him swirling the
[39:09] sword say glory to god he's before us
[39:12] amen what made them faint
[39:14] when they they when they became so
[39:16] faintly when they were way bigger
[39:20] now listen why why they said we look
[39:22] like grasshoppers up beside them how
[39:24] could they faint
[39:26] they were sitting behind big walls and
[39:28] big slings and rocks and everything and
[39:30] spears and everything outnumbered by
[39:33] thousands times thousands and thousands
[39:35] they outnumbered them certainly they
[39:37] could they were all united together why
[39:39] can't we run the bunch little handful of
[39:42] little bitty old scrawny scrubby looking
[39:44] men with old sickle bars and things like
[39:47] that to fight with
[39:49] now you know what we're not taught we're
[39:51] not talking about some
[39:53] polished army not not some army that
[39:55] looked like the egyptian army but we're
[39:57] just talking about ordinary men
[40:01] when when brother ramsey when when the
[40:03] army of jericho when jericho began to
[40:05] look and see what what they look like
[40:09] there was nothing that from the physical
[40:12] the natural standpoint they should be
[40:13] worried about them
[40:16] when you begin to speak and you think
[40:17] about that jericho had walls they could
[40:20] run chariots on
[40:22] when you begin to think of the size of
[40:24] the army and the condition that they
[40:26] were up against why would why would
[40:28] anybody be worried about about
[40:31] israel about the children of israel
[40:33] because they're so small
[40:35] right and we're so great and we're so
[40:37] we're so
[40:38] large
[40:42] when you begin to see what what what is
[40:44] what is around me
[40:49] but they realize that didn't have it
[40:50] they didn't have anything to do with it
[40:54] why because here was this great army and
[40:57] they had seen what happened to the other
[40:59] kings and the
[41:02] egyptians
[41:04] so
[41:05] you know when you when you look at
[41:08] what's around you the physical the
[41:10] natural
[41:13] so you can't you can't put your faith in
[41:15] those things
[41:19] you know because you can you can have
[41:20] you can have all the money in the world
[41:22] one day and be broke the next
[41:25] you can be perfectly healthy one day and
[41:26] be absolutely on your death bed the next
[41:29] right
[41:31] he doesn't it doesn't matter you can
[41:32] have you can have everything go your way
[41:34] and the next day everything goes against
[41:36] you
[41:38] it changes just as the just as the wind
[41:40] blows just as a snap of a finger it all
[41:42] changes
[41:44] the book of james tells us that the
[41:46] light our life is just like a vapor so
[41:48] we don't know how long we're going to be
[41:49] here
[41:51] that's right if we try to put our faith
[41:53] in the natural things
[41:56] our intelligence
[42:01] the same the same people that we that we
[42:03] see today that that the intelligence
[42:05] that people the people want you to trust
[42:07] in them because they have they have such
[42:09] great minds on how to figure things out
[42:12] and solve problems and we're going we're
[42:14] going to make everything better and they
[42:16] can't figure out if they're boys or
[42:17] girls
[42:20] and people want to put confidence in
[42:22] that
[42:25] we got we got a government that blows
[42:27] money like there's like it's going out
[42:29] of style and there's no there's no end
[42:30] to it
[42:32] and you know what it's all around the
[42:34] world government's everywhere
[42:36] and people people want to put their
[42:37] confidence in a government
[42:40] when every single one of when satan and
[42:43] jesus was talking he told them that
[42:45] every single one of those governments
[42:47] the whole wide world belonged to satan
[42:50] that's right
[42:51] and if and if satan is in charge of it
[42:53] then you know what it's all going to be
[42:55] destroyed
[42:56] it's all going to destruction
[42:59] but there's one thing that won't fail
[43:01] there's one thing that won't change and
[43:02] that's the word of god
[43:04] jesus said heaven and earth will pass
[43:06] away he said but my word will not pass
[43:08] away
[43:09] if you're going to stand on something
[43:10] sure and stand behind something to be
[43:12] fortified behind something that's the
[43:13] word of god
[43:20] he said continuing on he says they're
[43:23] not military men at all the only thing
[43:24] they are walking along with them little
[43:26] bitty old sandals not warriors or
[43:28] campers and dwellers and fanatics and
[43:29] holy rollers
[43:31] well why why can't we standing down on
[43:33] the banks and shouting and screaming
[43:35] bringing disgrace
[43:37] why can't we
[43:38] can't we armor ourselves and go
[43:40] against them
[43:42] there was nothing in the hearts why
[43:45] god said i'll send my fear before you
[43:48] amen there it is i'll send my fear
[43:50] before you for my people my covenant
[43:53] people
[43:54] i've called you by election i have
[43:57] chosen you i have put you into the body
[44:00] and you're circumcised now you're
[44:02] believers and you go on i'm with you
[44:04] it's all yours
[44:06] so he has called them into a place
[44:10] so it's not has anything to do with the
[44:12] natural or the physical
[44:14] but it's all what god has done
[44:17] what god has called them to
[44:23] now we continue on
[44:29] verse 19
[44:32] and it says that it shall be
[44:34] that whosoever go
[44:36] shall go out of the doors of thy house
[44:38] into the street his blood shall be upon
[44:41] his head and we will be guiltless and
[44:44] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[44:46] house his blood shall be on our head if
[44:48] any man if any hand be upon him
[44:52] and if thou utter this our business then
[44:55] we will be quit of of thine oath which
[44:58] thou has made us to swear and she said
[45:00] according
[45:01] unto your words so be it
[45:04] and she sent them away and they departed
[45:06] and she bound the scarlet line
[45:09] in the window and they went and came
[45:11] unto the mountain above their three days
[45:14] until the pursuers were returned and the
[45:16] pursuers sought them throughout all the
[45:18] way but found them not so the two men
[45:21] returned
[45:23] and descended from the mountain
[45:25] and passed over and came to joshua the
[45:27] son of nun and told them all things
[45:30] that befell them and they said unto
[45:32] joshua truly the lord hath delivered
[45:35] into our hands all the land for even all
[45:38] the inhabitants of the country do faint
[45:41] because of us
[45:43] amen so we know that the word went forth
[45:48] and they had received it and they
[45:49] realized
[45:50] that it's encouraging to realize
[45:54] not just not just what
[45:57] what god had told them but when the word
[45:59] came back from the land
[46:03] then they realized hey you know what god
[46:05] has laid all this in our hands
[46:07] god has called us into this land and
[46:09] it's ours
[46:10] now we're going to go in and possess
[46:12] what belongs to us
[46:17] no
[46:23] you know this is from
[46:25] from as i was with moses so i'll be with
[46:28] thee
[46:29] and brother brother i'm speaking and
[46:30] he's talking about
[46:34] rahab
[46:35] and he said one day she heard that there
[46:37] was a god that was moving her heart
[46:39] began to tremble she found a messenger
[46:41] that was a great move she that told her
[46:44] what was going to take place he said
[46:47] what did what did she say no joshua had
[46:49] signed joshua had the same signs that
[46:50] moses had exactly
[46:53] but said she didn't ask to see the signs
[46:55] she just heard
[46:57] she heard what had taken place she
[47:00] didn't she didn't go out to see any of
[47:02] the signs
[47:04] so she didn't go out to find out she
[47:05] didn't see them in any manner fall from
[47:08] the heavens she never saw the waters
[47:10] part or any of those things but she
[47:12] believed what she had heard
[47:15] so just believing
[47:18] as jesus told thomas
[47:20] he said blessed are those that have not
[47:22] seen and believe
[47:25] it's one thing it's one thing to see and
[47:26] believe but he said greater is the
[47:28] blessing when you don't see and then you
[47:30] believe
[47:32] when you can believe what you've not
[47:33] seen but you've heard and something
[47:35] stirred inside of her that she was going
[47:37] to believe what was told to her
[47:40] and then we see that she took that that
[47:42] scarlet thread
[47:44] as they told her they had a scarlet
[47:46] thread and she tied it in the window as
[47:48] a token of what of what had been spoken
[47:51] to her
[47:52] that token was given to her to be put on
[47:54] display
[47:56] because what what she had heard in her
[47:58] time that was her that was the oath that
[48:00] they had made to her
[48:02] that was going to be
[48:04] the covenant to her
[48:07] and same way with you and i today we
[48:08] have we have a covenant
[48:12] you know as we've been preaching on for
[48:14] so you know in the different ones why
[48:16] why it's so important why because you
[48:18] know what you're not going to get
[48:19] anywhere unless you have the token
[48:23] it is so important to have the token not
[48:25] just not just to think that you have it
[48:28] or talk about it but it's got to be a
[48:30] true indwelling it's got to be a real
[48:33] true possession
[48:36] and as as it was we know that she heard
[48:38] those preachers
[48:39] those messengers came and began to speak
[48:42] to her and when they come her across her
[48:44] path she realized the condition that she
[48:46] was in and she got desperate
[48:49] she reached a place of desperation but
[48:51] you know what she became to the place
[48:53] she was going to hang on to that
[48:56] she was going to hang on to that scarlet
[48:58] threat
[48:59] and it was put in the window and when it
[49:02] was tied into the window of the of her
[49:04] home then it became her job
[49:08] to get those that of her family
[49:12] into the house
[49:14] because you know there was no other
[49:15] place it was going to be but one place
[49:17] that was going to have safety and that
[49:19] was her home
[49:21] and it's the same way with you and i the
[49:22] same thing is that if you have if you've
[49:25] been received the token
[49:27] what is what is the token it's the new
[49:29] birth it's the holy ghost inside of you
[49:32] why is it so important not not to have
[49:34] just some kind of dried eye confession
[49:38] not just say well i went to the altar
[49:39] and i shook the preacher's hand but it's
[49:41] got to have but it's got to be a life of
[49:43] jesus christ manifested in you that you
[49:46] manifest christ
[49:47] that christ has taken up while you've
[49:49] sold out you've died out to yourself and
[49:51] you've allowed him to come in and take
[49:54] over and have the leadership and when he
[49:56] takes over and he resides in you then it
[49:59] becomes no longer eyes paul said no
[50:01] longer i that live now but it's christ
[50:03] that lives in me
[50:05] that he has the preeminence then the
[50:07] token can be on
[50:10] display so each person has to have that
[50:13] token on display for themselves
[50:17] i can't get in because my mama has it
[50:19] i can't get in because my daddy has it
[50:23] i can't get in because i come to this
[50:25] church i got to have an experience for
[50:27] myself
[50:29] i've got to know that i know that i know
[50:31] that when i come to death's doorstep
[50:32] then you know what that is only going to
[50:34] bring me from this dimension into
[50:36] another i'm going to step into the
[50:37] presence of god that i'm that i've got
[50:40] that assurance that i'm leaving here and
[50:42] going someplace else not just not just
[50:45] crossing over and telling some good kind
[50:47] of story why because there better not be
[50:50] anything that holds us back
[50:52] and because you know our brothers and
[50:53] sisters god has called us in this day
[50:56] and by by the scripture has called us in
[50:58] this day there's a group that's going to
[51:00] be standing waiting that's going to be
[51:02] calling for the dead to come out of the
[51:04] ground
[51:05] first thessalonians 4 is going to call
[51:07] there's going to be somebody that's not
[51:09] going to hinder or prevent those that
[51:11] are asleep to come back
[51:13] amen
[51:14] [Music]
[51:18] as paul said in first corinthians 15 he
[51:21] said behold i show you a mystery he said
[51:23] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[51:25] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[51:27] of an eye why because there's something
[51:29] that's going to carry us over that we're
[51:31] going to be waiting to speak to them
[51:33] that it's going to come out of the
[51:34] ground
[51:36] now it's not just some fairy tale that's
[51:37] going to come a hundred years we don't
[51:39] know it may come in the morning
[51:41] but the thing is today is the day of
[51:43] salvation the day is a day that you make
[51:45] sure that you're ready to go because you
[51:46] never know when you're going to leave
[51:48] we're not we're not promised tomorrow
[51:50] we're not even promised this afternoon
[51:52] but there's one thing that we do have a
[51:53] promise that wherever we step and we
[51:56] come over whatever we come to god's
[51:58] going to lead us all the way and there's
[51:59] a place that we can go
[52:01] when we leave here we have it we have a
[52:04] tabernacle we have a house not made by
[52:06] hands eternal in the heavens that when
[52:08] we step out of this dimension we step
[52:10] into that one that we are there with the
[52:12] with the ones that have passed
[52:16] that god's going to carry us all the way
[52:18] whichever way whatever we go through god
[52:21] is leading us and he's there he's given
[52:23] us a token
[52:25] but the problem is is you've got to
[52:26] accept it
[52:28] just as rahab she had she had the
[52:31] messengers come and speak to her and you
[52:33] know what she began to confess what she
[52:35] believed
[52:37] and not only did she confess what she
[52:39] believed then she turned around and she
[52:41] done exactly what they told her to do
[52:43] she had an oath that was given to her
[52:45] and she walked in that oath
[52:50] praise the lord
[52:54] that's our that's our job
[52:58] you know i've got i've got two boys and
[52:59] you know what they can't they can't come
[53:01] in they can't come in because mom and
[53:02] daddy's got it
[53:05] it's my job to make sure that they get
[53:08] it
[53:10] do i hold the token over there
[53:12] the token life is applied over them and
[53:15] she held and she applied ray have
[53:17] applied the token to her house and you
[53:19] know what it was her job to get them
[53:20] inside the house to get them in the uh
[53:22] into the place of safety because there's
[53:25] no other place that it's going to be but
[53:26] where god has called you to be where god
[53:29] has called you to put that token in your
[53:31] in yourself
[53:33] he comes and lives in your heart in your
[53:35] life then you've got to take that same
[53:37] token and apply it to your household
[53:39] your family you've got to be the ones
[53:41] that's got to stand for them
[53:44] we got to we got to commit because i
[53:46] believe that every one of the children
[53:49] that's in this church you know they can
[53:50] go out and do whatever they want to live
[53:52] any kind of life whatever they want to
[53:53] live but you know what that token is
[53:55] still there the token is still applied
[53:59] i'm still we still claim our children
[54:04] it's not a hope so or we worry about no
[54:06] we're gonna put our we're gonna put our
[54:07] confidence in god why because he said so
[54:10] i put my you got to put your children
[54:12] and god i put my children in god's hands
[54:16] i don't want because you know what i
[54:17] don't want it to come sometime in the
[54:19] future and then they look at me and say
[54:21] well daddy you didn't live the right
[54:22] kind of life daddy you've done this and
[54:24] you've done that i want them to see
[54:25] jesus christ in me i want to be so sold
[54:28] out that they don't see aaron roberts i
[54:30] want to be so sold out that they see
[54:32] jesus christ in me i want them to know
[54:34] what a true living
[54:36] christian walking in shoe leather looks
[54:38] like why because the world can be so
[54:40] full of fakes and so so many hypocrites
[54:43] and everybody that's all everybody wants
[54:45] to point to is what the hypocrites well
[54:47] look at this one look at the way they
[54:48] live and look at that one and then you
[54:50] know i want somebody to point to the one
[54:51] because the devil always wants to point
[54:53] you to the counterfeits
[54:54] but i want them to know what a real true
[54:56] genuine born-again child of god looks
[54:59] like
[55:00] i want them to know what god manifested
[55:03] in human flesh again looks like
[55:07] not just some idea but just some thought
[55:10] it's just some pretty pictures or words
[55:14] but may it be manifested may it be a
[55:16] life
[55:19] i want them to know
[55:21] who god is for themselves
[55:28] it's the life behind the name
[55:32] we got to know the name we got to walk
[55:34] in jesus name
[55:36] everything that we do is in his name
[55:40] if we don't have we don't take on his
[55:42] name we ain't got anything
[55:46] let's walk in we walk in the light
[55:49] as he is in the light we want to walk in
[55:51] the light
[55:52] of the word that he shines
[55:54] as we were speaking before
[55:57] let us walk in the light
[55:59] as he is in the light we got to focus
[56:04] that's what our focus is on the light
[56:06] as he shines that light we want to focus
[56:08] on those things
[56:10] he's he gives us that token
[56:13] and i want to walk and see
[56:15] that i'm everything that i say and do
[56:18] is pleasing to him
[56:20] that it that it manifests him i want to
[56:22] be
[56:23] what he wants me to be
[56:26] i don't want to have my own thoughts or
[56:28] beliefs or ideas
[56:31] because you know
[56:33] you know the the spies told her said
[56:35] listen you got to get your family in
[56:36] this house
[56:39] and you got to tie this scarlet thread
[56:40] in the window
[56:42] you got to get you got to line things up
[56:44] well you know what she's like well you
[56:45] know what i'm just going to hang it on
[56:46] the on the mailbox
[56:48] or you know i'll get to it tomorrow
[56:53] no
[56:54] it was it was imperative
[56:57] that she get it hung because you know
[56:58] what she didn't know how long it was
[57:00] going to take before they got back
[57:04] because you know the thing is when we
[57:05] read in the scripture
[57:08] we don't know how long it took them
[57:11] in the scripture reading we realized
[57:13] that joshua and the army was still on
[57:16] the other side
[57:17] they still on the other side of jordan
[57:21] and so when they crossed back over
[57:22] jordan and they talked to joshua then we
[57:24] realized that later on joshua and the
[57:27] children of israel cross over
[57:29] they cross over jordan they reach into
[57:31] that's when they reach into the river
[57:34] and they pick up the stones and they set
[57:36] a memorial in the river and then they
[57:38] set a memorial on the outside of the
[57:40] river and then they come over there and
[57:42] they're waiting
[57:45] now here they stack these stones the
[57:48] scripture tells us later on that while
[57:50] while rahab is waiting in her house
[57:53] trying to persuade her family to get
[57:55] into the or get into the house of safety
[57:58] to get under that scarlet thread we
[58:00] realize that the children of israel have
[58:02] crossed over they have to circumcise
[58:04] those that were not circumcised in the
[58:07] wilderness
[58:08] they suck they sacrifice and uh
[58:11] do the uh
[58:13] passover
[58:15] the whole passover and then when they
[58:18] come from that then after the after
[58:20] everybody after the men have healed from
[58:22] the from the circumcision then they
[58:25] prepared to go to jericho
[58:28] so you know what it wasn't it wasn't
[58:29] that the men just slipped out
[58:33] and then you know she's like well you
[58:34] know i'm just waiting for him to come
[58:35] back
[58:38] and you know the brother said that that
[58:40] god's biggest enemies is sight and time
[58:45] and so here they are there's you know
[58:47] she she could get uh
[58:49] discouraged
[58:51] and she you know she could but what
[58:52] where they had because you know i i've
[58:54] seen them leave but they're not they're
[58:55] not back
[58:57] well they left yesterday they're not
[58:59] back today
[59:00] it's been a week they're not back
[59:04] you know what hey we don't we don't know
[59:05] when the lord's coming we don't know
[59:06] what god's plan is but you know we got
[59:08] to be ready for every minute
[59:11] we've got to be ready every at any time
[59:13] we don't know what's going to take place
[59:16] but we have to keep watching and that's
[59:18] what she had to she was watching to see
[59:20] what was going to take place
[59:22] every single day it was you got to be in
[59:24] the house you got to be in the house you
[59:26] got to be under this ark you got to be
[59:28] under this covenant that has taken place
[59:29] this oath that's been given me you got
[59:31] to be in this house you got to get in
[59:33] here and stay
[59:36] and every day she you know she goes out
[59:38] and you can imagine trying to live your
[59:40] life and everything that you do well i
[59:42] got to go get some water well we got to
[59:43] go get water but we got to go get food
[59:44] we got to take care of these things but
[59:45] we got to be in the house
[59:47] always looking to see where we're at
[59:50] because we never know when it's going to
[59:51] take place
[59:52] when this thing's going to take place we
[59:54] got to be there to get in this ark we
[59:56] got to get in this house
[59:58] this this refuge it says or where we got
[1:00:01] to be at when all this thing takes place
[1:00:06] not just worried about everything else
[1:00:09] but get in the house
[1:00:11] be under that token
[1:00:14] and so when they when they began to see
[1:00:16] these things well wait they didn't come
[1:00:18] they didn't come today they didn't come
[1:00:20] they didn't come yesterday
[1:00:23] keep a watchful eye
[1:00:25] we never as jesus said we you know not
[1:00:28] when the lord cometh
[1:00:31] but you always got to be ready
[1:00:35] not leave things undone
[1:00:39] not just let little things slip by
[1:00:43] take everything under consideration
[1:00:46] take care of every little thing
[1:00:56] he said we take care
[1:00:58] of all these things and
[1:01:01] brother iran says we have a token today
[1:01:04] he said he said as long as he said it's
[1:01:06] the blood of jesus christ
[1:01:08] he said we have to stay under that
[1:01:10] each individual stays under that token
[1:01:13] themselves
[1:01:14] we must we must receive that ourselves
[1:01:18] we come into that land
[1:01:20] take that
[1:01:24] you know old things have passed away you
[1:01:26] come in and become a new creature in
[1:01:28] christ jesus
[1:01:29] so when you come into you you let all
[1:01:31] the other things pass
[1:01:33] and it becomes new to you
[1:01:36] i and not not to hold on to these things
[1:01:39] but to following god
[1:01:41] leaving the things that are behind us
[1:01:46] you know you you can't you can't look
[1:01:47] ahead and you can't look ahead and see
[1:01:50] what god has for you if you spend all
[1:01:52] your time looking in the rearview mirror
[1:01:56] people people you know they they look at
[1:01:58] all the things that have taken place in
[1:02:00] the past and they wonder why things
[1:02:02] happen and go and the devil wants you to
[1:02:04] keep your eye on those things
[1:02:06] what are we what are we looking back for
[1:02:09] we look at all we'll look at all our
[1:02:11] failures all our faults and all our sins
[1:02:14] and then we'll stand up and say
[1:02:16] it's covered by the blood
[1:02:18] it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:02:21] that not to be remembered anymore
[1:02:24] not to be remembered anymore
[1:02:28] not to be remembered anymore
[1:02:30] well if he's not remembered and why are
[1:02:32] you remembering it
[1:02:36] why is it but say the devil that's what
[1:02:37] he's got you looking at what's what
[1:02:39] you've done
[1:02:41] what you come from
[1:02:44] but let me tell you something it's not
[1:02:45] where you came from it's where you
[1:02:48] finish
[1:02:50] it's where you end up
[1:02:53] that's what's important it's not where
[1:02:54] you start
[1:02:57] i was speaking to a man at work today or
[1:02:59] the other day and we were talking and he
[1:03:01] was talking about a young man that's
[1:03:04] that's working with us and man he is he
[1:03:06] is a super nice guy and he's and he
[1:03:08] really works hard and everything like
[1:03:10] that and he's got so much going for him
[1:03:12] and everybody said man if you if you saw
[1:03:14] the life that this boy came from it's a
[1:03:16] wonder he does anything
[1:03:18] because his parents are so worthless
[1:03:21] and every you know he's never had he's
[1:03:23] never had a thing going right in his
[1:03:25] life but you know what when you told to
[1:03:27] him you know what he's not down
[1:03:30] he's a he you know he's one of the
[1:03:31] nicest guys that you want to be around
[1:03:33] and you won't talk about somebody that's
[1:03:34] got a positive attitude
[1:03:37] you know what because we can we can we
[1:03:38] can look and we can have the worst
[1:03:41] attitude about things or we can we can
[1:03:43] look and have the best attitude about
[1:03:45] things it's how we approach it
[1:03:48] whether whether we like it or not
[1:03:50] many people they they go along and you
[1:03:52] know if you give them a million dollars
[1:03:54] they would be upset that they'd have to
[1:03:57] give half of it to the government in
[1:03:58] taxes
[1:04:00] they instead of realizing i got a half a
[1:04:02] million dollars they'd be more worried
[1:04:04] about what they got more upset with what
[1:04:06] they lost than what they gained
[1:04:10] if you give them if you give them a
[1:04:12] dollar they'd be upset they didn't get
[1:04:13] two dollars if you give them five
[1:04:15] dollars they didn't get 10.
[1:04:17] and it didn't really matter because but
[1:04:18] no matter how much you give to them they
[1:04:20] can't be blessed by what they got
[1:04:24] when you see other people that haven't
[1:04:25] got anything
[1:04:27] they haven't have a lot harder than we
[1:04:29] have it and you know what they are more
[1:04:30] blessed and more happy and more joyous
[1:04:32] what they know what they've got and
[1:04:34] we're over blessed and we got all the
[1:04:36] because you know the scripture tells us
[1:04:38] in psalms the scripture tells us that
[1:04:41] the blessing of the lord it maketh rich
[1:04:43] and he addeth no sorrow to it
[1:04:47] you know one of the reasons i was
[1:04:48] thinking about this the other day you
[1:04:49] know that's the reason why god don't
[1:04:51] bless people like they want to get
[1:04:52] blessed people want to be millionaires
[1:04:55] they got that slogan lord make me a
[1:04:57] millionaire so i can show you that it
[1:04:58] won't ruin me
[1:05:02] god knows but the scripture says he's
[1:05:04] not going to bless you if he knows it's
[1:05:06] going to add sorrow to you
[1:05:08] well because some people they want to
[1:05:10] get blessed but you know what they're
[1:05:11] not in a position to receive that
[1:05:13] they're not in a position to receive
[1:05:15] blessings from god why because they
[1:05:17] don't know how to handle it
[1:05:22] and so it can it just adds more problems
[1:05:26] but god knows how to bless us
[1:05:29] and give us what we have need of
[1:05:32] and many times we fail to realize that
[1:05:34] that our trials and our tribulations
[1:05:37] paul said they work at their work their
[1:05:39] weight in gold
[1:05:41] they're more precious than gold to us
[1:05:44] so if they're more precious than gold
[1:05:46] then you know what our our trials and
[1:05:48] our tribulations and our problems and
[1:05:50] you know what they are what makes us
[1:05:51] rich but people don't see that
[1:05:54] why because it's through those things
[1:05:56] that we face that god brings us through
[1:05:59] we put our trust in him that when he
[1:06:02] brings us through these things and you
[1:06:03] know then we realize you know i'm a more
[1:06:05] than a conqueror through him that love
[1:06:07] me then i've become a place then i
[1:06:09] realize you know i can overcome these
[1:06:10] things because i'm being molded by him
[1:06:13] by the things that i suffered just like
[1:06:14] jesus he became
[1:06:18] as the scripture says you know he
[1:06:21] learned by the things that he suffered
[1:06:25] so we have to learn by the things that
[1:06:27] we suffer
[1:06:30] you
[1:06:30] know
[1:06:32] our our moms
[1:06:34] and our dads you know
[1:06:37] you know they they give us a
[1:06:40] lot of hard times in life sometimes
[1:06:44] you know we but you know what it's it's
[1:06:45] some of the best learning that we ever
[1:06:47] get
[1:06:51] you know paul said one time he said he
[1:06:52] said you know our fathers corrected us
[1:06:55] and we give them honor
[1:06:57] well how much more than our heavenly
[1:06:59] father
[1:07:00] bring us through these things that we
[1:07:02] give him more honor
[1:07:04] you see you see children they get they
[1:07:06] get anything and everything that they
[1:07:08] want
[1:07:10] but you know what it doesn't it doesn't
[1:07:12] bless them
[1:07:16] richard and i i guess richard's in the
[1:07:17] back i don't see him but
[1:07:19] you know what richard i we have we have
[1:07:21] these times where we just get together
[1:07:22] and we talk about things that we went
[1:07:24] through in our childhood
[1:07:26] that wasn't too funny back then but you
[1:07:27] know we laugh about now
[1:07:31] hey you know you know
[1:07:32] my dad you know my dad always said when
[1:07:34] i was growing up
[1:07:36] we had this and we didn't have that and
[1:07:38] all these things and then you know i
[1:07:39] sound like my dad sometimes because i
[1:07:41] tell the boys when i was growing up we
[1:07:43] didn't have this and we had that we've
[1:07:44] done this and done that
[1:07:48] well because you start every morning you
[1:07:49] wake up and you look in the mirror and
[1:07:51] you see dale roberts
[1:07:55] i do i wake up oh there's dead and then
[1:07:57] i start to hear him
[1:08:01] why because that's who i am i'm a son of
[1:08:04] dale roberts
[1:08:06] how much more being a son of god
[1:08:10] but
[1:08:11] i think about the things that that
[1:08:12] richard and i have you know i remember
[1:08:14] getting out trying to mow the yard and
[1:08:16] with a push mower and the handlebar on
[1:08:18] the the bar on the mower about that tall
[1:08:22] being a hey if we're big enough to mow
[1:08:24] you know we could push the mower with
[1:08:26] mowing the yard
[1:08:28] and it was like sometimes it's like all
[1:08:30] you could do try to pull the string to
[1:08:32] get the mower running
[1:08:34] and we pulled and we got it going
[1:08:36] and get out there and
[1:08:38] had a bar at the top one on the bottom
[1:08:40] in the middle and i would have here and
[1:08:43] here and just push everything that i had
[1:08:45] trying to move that yard
[1:08:47] trying to mow the grass
[1:08:50] and you know everybody's like well you
[1:08:52] know what we need a self-propelled we
[1:08:54] need a zero turn no
[1:08:58] hey we had zero turns we turned it
[1:09:01] we made zero turns
[1:09:07] we've done it ourselves
[1:09:10] you know people people don't realize
[1:09:11] that the blessing that god has given
[1:09:13] them
[1:09:14] by the things that they've had to go
[1:09:16] through
[1:09:19] you know dad always said that he wasn't
[1:09:20] going to buy a dishwasher he said
[1:09:21] because he had four of them
[1:09:26] but you know we went through those
[1:09:27] things well but but you know it's a
[1:09:28] blessing now
[1:09:31] now it wasn't a blessing then and same
[1:09:33] thing when we look at things that we
[1:09:34] have to go through in our lives
[1:09:36] god brings us to situations in our lives
[1:09:38] and you know what we don't stop and
[1:09:40] think thank you lord that's what i
[1:09:41] wanted
[1:09:43] but when we look back then we say thank
[1:09:45] god that he brought me through those
[1:09:46] things that i've been through those
[1:09:48] battles that i've been through those
[1:09:50] mountains but i've been through those
[1:09:51] valleys
[1:09:52] because god's brought me someplace
[1:09:55] he's brought me through
[1:10:02] we got to stay under that
[1:10:04] under that token
[1:10:06] it's so important so it's the if if you
[1:10:09] if you don't get anything else get the
[1:10:11] token
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:13] how how you got to have an experience of
[1:10:15] a new birth
[1:10:18] that's what jesus told nicodemus you
[1:10:19] must be born again
[1:10:21] if there's nothing else we got to be
[1:10:22] born again
[1:10:27] if you
[1:10:28] know you wish you could just give it to
[1:10:31] people
[1:10:32] but you know what god didn't force it
[1:10:34] down your throat you can't force it down
[1:10:35] anybody else's
[1:10:37] but all you can do is offer it
[1:10:41] and be a shining
[1:10:42] example as brother branham said let's be
[1:10:45] salty
[1:10:47] because if you display it they'll desire
[1:10:51] it they'll see something that's
[1:10:52] different about you
[1:11:01] you know here we're gonna go to
[1:11:03] joshua
[1:11:04] chapter six before we finish this
[1:11:06] morning
[1:11:09] and verse 15.
[1:11:12] and the scripture tells us here it says
[1:11:14] and it came to pass on the seventh day
[1:11:17] that they rose early about the dawning
[1:11:19] of the day and compassed the city after
[1:11:21] the same matter seven times
[1:11:24] only on that on that day they can pass
[1:11:27] the city seven times
[1:11:29] and he said it came to pass at the
[1:11:31] seventh time when the priest blew with
[1:11:33] the trumpets joshua said unto the people
[1:11:35] shout
[1:11:37] for the lord hath given you the city and
[1:11:39] the city
[1:11:40] shall be accursed even it
[1:11:42] and all that are therein
[1:11:46] to the lord
[1:11:48] only rahab the harlot shall live she and
[1:11:50] all that are with her in in the house
[1:11:54] where because she hid the messengers
[1:11:56] that we sent
[1:11:59] he said and ye in any wise keep
[1:12:02] yourselves from the accursed thing lest
[1:12:04] you make yourselves accursed when you
[1:12:07] take of the accursed thing
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:10] and make the camp of israel a curse and
[1:12:12] trouble it
[1:12:14] but all the silver and gold and vessels
[1:12:16] of brass and iron are consecrated unto
[1:12:18] the lord they shall come into the
[1:12:20] treasury of the lord so the people
[1:12:22] shouted when the priests blew with the
[1:12:24] trumpets and it came to pass when the
[1:12:26] people heard the sound of the trumpet
[1:12:28] and the people shouted with a great
[1:12:31] shout and the wall fell down flat
[1:12:34] so that the people went up into the city
[1:12:37] and every man straight before them and
[1:12:39] they took the city
[1:12:42] so
[1:12:43] we know that when when he began to speak
[1:12:47] and they come into the land
[1:12:49] and it came time
[1:12:51] god didn't
[1:12:53] face
[1:12:54] the
[1:12:55] this great fortress
[1:12:58] as most people would have thought it
[1:13:01] now here they now here they are now
[1:13:04] when you see the here they come out and
[1:13:06] they're going to fight
[1:13:07] and god tells them to listen when you go
[1:13:09] up
[1:13:10] don't make a sound
[1:13:13] so don't try to argue with nobody
[1:13:16] just going about your business
[1:13:19] and so here they are you go around the
[1:13:21] first day you're just gonna walk around
[1:13:22] the walls
[1:13:24] and then you come back to camp
[1:13:26] and the second day
[1:13:28] you'll go up and walk around the walls
[1:13:31] and come back to camp
[1:13:33] now no doubt when these people because
[1:13:35] if they were if the people of jericho
[1:13:37] were fearful
[1:13:39] and they didn't have any
[1:13:41] any uh strength
[1:13:43] they didn't have any fight him do you
[1:13:45] know how to scare somebody
[1:13:48] you know they always say walk around
[1:13:49] when you smile at somebody and somebody
[1:13:51] wonder what you're up to
[1:13:55] you know how to do that
[1:13:57] you know how to walk up to somebody and
[1:13:58] say something that they don't they're
[1:14:00] expecting you to say
[1:14:02] and then you make them uncomfortable
[1:14:05] well if you've got a group around up
[1:14:06] there that are looking at these people
[1:14:10] and they're already nervous
[1:14:12] don't say nothing and walk around the
[1:14:15] place and then leave
[1:14:20] there was a there was a lady years ago
[1:14:22] that used to come into the mcdonald's up
[1:14:24] in tennessee where mom lives and she
[1:14:25] would i've seen her just walk in and she
[1:14:28] stare at the menu for a while
[1:14:31] just stare at the sign and then turn
[1:14:32] around walk out
[1:14:36] and people stand there like
[1:14:41] well can you imagine these people
[1:14:42] walking up there every day don't say
[1:14:43] nothing you walk around the building and
[1:14:44] leave
[1:14:46] and then the next day they get up there
[1:14:47] walk around and leave
[1:14:49] and walk around and leave
[1:14:51] and hear all these people every single
[1:14:53] day there was more of them looking over
[1:14:54] the wall jericho like
[1:14:57] you see these nuts
[1:15:00] what are they doing
[1:15:02] i don't know
[1:15:05] this makes no sense
[1:15:08] and here they come again another day
[1:15:10] they're doing the same thing
[1:15:13] and people trying to figure out whether
[1:15:14] you know what there's no book that tells
[1:15:16] us anything about this
[1:15:18] there's no ancient writings there's no
[1:15:20] nothing we don't have any idea what
[1:15:21] they're doing
[1:15:24] because god didn't speak to them he
[1:15:26] spoke to joshua joshua knew what he was
[1:15:28] doing the rest of them didn't know
[1:15:30] and every single day to that last day
[1:15:31] then they get up there and it's like
[1:15:32] walk around seven times and it's like
[1:15:35] they're walking around again
[1:15:38] they're walking around again
[1:15:42] well no one of these people these people
[1:15:43] are scared to death
[1:15:45] well here they are walking oh it's the
[1:15:46] sabbath day and now they're making all
[1:15:48] these laps around the place
[1:15:53] i don't know about you but you know what
[1:15:55] i ain't got nothing
[1:15:57] you know you're just about ready to run
[1:16:01] i mean you you're just you're just
[1:16:03] shaking he's like
[1:16:05] we ain't never seen this before and look
[1:16:06] at what they're doing
[1:16:08] but you know what every single time they
[1:16:10] made a lap you know what then they had
[1:16:12] confidence in what was going to take
[1:16:14] place
[1:16:15] joshua told them said we're going to
[1:16:16] walk around this thing seven times
[1:16:20] he said then
[1:16:21] the trump the priests are going to blow
[1:16:23] the trumpets and he said you're going to
[1:16:25] shout
[1:16:27] these mighty massive walls
[1:16:31] but you know what the promise was given
[1:16:33] to rahab that she wouldn't she wouldn't
[1:16:34] be hurt
[1:16:37] and so we we see that how they walked
[1:16:39] around and they blew the trumpets and
[1:16:41] they shouted and the walls fail
[1:16:43] now the scripture says the walls fell
[1:16:45] down if you read and read in the in the
[1:16:47] original it actually says the walls fell
[1:16:49] flat
[1:16:50] they actually went down
[1:16:54] when you look at when you look at the
[1:16:55] archaeology digs
[1:16:58] of the of the ancient city of jericho
[1:17:01] when they actually dug up jericho and
[1:17:03] they look at it you know they can
[1:17:04] actually see where the walls fail
[1:17:07] but you know what there's there's a
[1:17:09] section of the wall they said it was
[1:17:10] eight me uh
[1:17:12] two meters high it's like eight feet
[1:17:13] high
[1:17:15] there's a whole section of the wall
[1:17:17] back there and there's there's two there
[1:17:19] was two walls there's a lower wall in
[1:17:21] the upper wall the mighty walls were the
[1:17:22] upper ones and they had a lower wall at
[1:17:24] the bottom
[1:17:26] and they said you know all of the lower
[1:17:28] people the lower class people lived
[1:17:29] along the bottom
[1:17:31] that little short wall down there do you
[1:17:33] know there's a section of they said
[1:17:34] there's a section in there of all the
[1:17:36] walls that fail
[1:17:38] there's a section that didn't
[1:17:40] if still standing
[1:17:43] why because god's word is true
[1:17:46] and all the walls fail
[1:17:49] but you know what where rehab was it
[1:17:51] didn't fall
[1:17:54] she was under that token of safety
[1:17:57] god's word held it
[1:18:00] and they come in and they brought her
[1:18:02] out
[1:18:03] the scripture says and and continue on
[1:18:06] in here in in chapter six and it
[1:18:10] says and they utterly destroyed all that
[1:18:13] were in the city both men and women
[1:18:16] young and old ox and sheep and ass with
[1:18:18] the edge of the sword but joshua said
[1:18:20] unto the two men that had spied over out
[1:18:23] the country go into the harlots
[1:18:25] house and bring out vince the woman
[1:18:28] and all that she hath as you swear unto
[1:18:30] her and the young men that were spies
[1:18:33] went in and brought out rahab and her
[1:18:35] father and her mother and her brethren
[1:18:37] and all that she had and they brought
[1:18:39] out all her kindred and left them
[1:18:41] without the camp of israel and then they
[1:18:43] burnt the city with fire and all that
[1:18:45] was therein only the silver and the gold
[1:18:48] and the vessels of brass and iron they
[1:18:50] put into the treasury of the house of
[1:18:51] god and joshua saved rahab the heart of
[1:18:54] the life and her father's household and
[1:18:56] all that she had and she dwelleth in
[1:18:58] israel even unto this day because she
[1:19:01] had messengers which
[1:19:03] joshua sent to spy out jericho
[1:19:06] so everything that was destroyed except
[1:19:08] for what god had promised her through
[1:19:11] her faith in god's
[1:19:14] word what god had done she had faith in
[1:19:17] and she believed those messengers that
[1:19:19] came
[1:19:20] and everything else was destroyed except
[1:19:22] for her and she came out
[1:19:24] and she and the scripture tells us that
[1:19:25] she dwelt in
[1:19:28] in with
[1:19:30] joshua and the children of israel
[1:19:33] all this time
[1:19:36] and you know it's amazing when you when
[1:19:38] you look to see where she came from to
[1:19:40] where she ended up here's a woman that
[1:19:42] didn't have anything
[1:19:45] a low reputation poor all these things
[1:19:48] that was against her but you know what
[1:19:49] she had faith in god
[1:19:52] and you know do you know where she ended
[1:19:54] up it's not where you start it's where
[1:19:56] you end up it's where you finish
[1:19:59] where did where did she where did we
[1:20:00] know that where she ended up what did
[1:20:02] she finish
[1:20:04] you know what she was the matriarch of
[1:20:07] the kings
[1:20:10] here's a woman that was of no reputation
[1:20:13] was poor
[1:20:15] a woman of ill repute
[1:20:18] but you know what all the things that
[1:20:20] she faced in her life
[1:20:22] she had faith in god and god brought her
[1:20:24] out
[1:20:24] brought her to a place and you know what
[1:20:27] as
[1:20:28] as i've said many times all of of
[1:20:31] rahab's past was in that fire
[1:20:35] all her sins and all of her failures and
[1:20:38] all her disappointments when they burnt
[1:20:40] that city that's where all it was
[1:20:43] she came out with her family and her
[1:20:45] belongings but you know her past was in
[1:20:47] that fire
[1:20:48] and that rubble and that destruction
[1:20:50] that's where her past was because when
[1:20:51] she came out she was a brand new person
[1:20:55] and you know the scripture tells us that
[1:20:57] she had a husband named salman who was a
[1:21:00] who was a
[1:21:01] general
[1:21:03] and she brought forth the scripture
[1:21:05] tells us
[1:21:07] in matthew chapter one says and salman
[1:21:09] begot boaz of rahab
[1:21:13] he said and boaz beget obed of ruth and
[1:21:15] obed begat jesse and jesse beget david
[1:21:20] the king and the david the king begat
[1:21:23] solomon of her that had been the wife of
[1:21:26] uriah
[1:21:28] so here's a woman that that had no
[1:21:31] reputation of all the things that she
[1:21:33] had been through but you know what she
[1:21:34] had faith in god
[1:21:35] to believe what god could do for her
[1:21:39] and when god when she had faith in god
[1:21:42] and walked in that
