[11:37] stand we're gonna look to the scriptures
[11:39] and not will be looking into Luke
[11:42] chapter 14 I'll just pray for me not
[11:47] pre-shape the Lord and I have a little
[11:53] sleeve orthopedic sleemo under my under
[11:57] my shirt
[11:58] thank the Lord it's not it's not big or
[12:01] bulky I can take it off a lot a lot
[12:03] easier than that brace and it's just a
[12:07] lot better and I've started physical
[12:11] therapy and you know you remember the
[12:18] the old saying about pain is just
[12:21] weakness leaving the body I keep trying
[12:24] to think that in my mind I told my said
[12:27] I don't know such a little person could
[12:28] put inflict so much pain on you but they
[12:31] know exactly where you hurt and that's
[12:32] where they're gonna stick their fingers
[12:33] and I didn't realize that I did not
[12:37] realize I thought they'd work on my
[12:39] elbow which is what out you know I've
[12:42] been stretching trying to stretch my
[12:43] elbow and they told me that it's not
[12:44] gonna work because all the muscles in
[12:47] your body have to work in unison and so
[12:50] I found out that they work every other
[12:51] muscle in your arm but your elbow and so
[12:54] I didn't realize that those were as
[12:56] needed and I didn't realized they were
[12:58] in the condition they were in until I
[12:59] started pushing and prodding and
[13:00] twisting and the low lady she grabbed
[13:03] hold of my arm and she grabbed the back
[13:06] of my elbow here and she pushed down on
[13:09] my hand right here and I thought I was
[13:10] going through the ceiling but I think
[13:13] the Lord it's working out and yester see
[13:18] today's winds so I went Monday to the
[13:20] doctor and it won't tell you something
[13:23] else she worked on my arm for an hour
[13:26] and a half and it was almost completely
[13:28] straight when she got done with it
[13:31] and that was that was an amazing thing
[13:34] because when you're standing there and
[13:36] you're holding your arms out and it's
[13:38] almost straight and you can see that you
[13:41] know it's coming along and people were
[13:45] amazed it was a young man who was an
[13:48] intern there he's going to school for
[13:50] fiscal therapy and he told me he was
[13:52] amazed he said you know somebody that
[13:53] with your incision looks so well he said
[13:56] that looks like somebody's incision
[13:57] that's you know months down the road
[13:59] because it just looks so well he was
[14:02] amazed that it's only been too much
[14:04] that's my surgery and I'm doing so well
[14:06] and everybody and my physical therapist
[14:10] she's just she just amazed she's you
[14:14] know what she till now I am
[14:16] I mean she's impressed with my progress
[14:18] she said because she's got a patient
[14:20] that broke her arm
[14:21] has messed up her elbow and she can't
[14:24] get she get a little bit I guess beyond
[14:26] 45 degrees from 90 degrees just a little
[14:29] bit and she she's been doing that for
[14:31] months since she can't get any further
[14:32] than that and I've been I've been in
[14:35] physical therapy three times and I've
[14:37] almost got my arm completely straight so
[14:41] just want to thank the Lord for that and
[14:45] I still can't you know claim the blood
[14:50] and he's still he's still the healer
[14:57] amen so we're just looking the scripture
[14:59] here too late tonight Luke chapter 14

[16:41] Luke chapter 14 forgetting was 16 and it
[16:46] says then said and unto him a certain
[16:51] man made a supper and bade many and sent
[16:53] his servant that supper time to say to
[16:55] them that were bidden come for all
[16:58] things are now ready and they all with
[17:01] one consent began to make excuse the
[17:04] first sent unto Him I have bought a
[17:06] piece of ground it must needs to go and
[17:08] see it and I pray thee have me excused I
[17:13] thought of you and another set of yoke
[17:19] of oxen and I go to prove them I pray
[17:22] thee have me excused and another set I
[17:25] have married a wife and therefore I
[17:27] cannot come so that so that servant came
[17:30] and showed his Lord these things then
[17:33] the master of the house being angry said
[17:35] to his servant go out quickly into the
[17:37] streets and lanes of the city and bring
[17:39] in hither the poor and the maned and the
[17:42] halt and the blind and the service said
[17:45] Lord it is done as thou has commanded
[17:47] and yet there is room and the Lord said
[17:50] unto the servant go out into the
[17:53] highways and hedges and compel them to
[17:55] come in that my house may be filled for
[17:58] I say unto you that none of these men
[18:00] which were bidden shall taste of my
[18:03] supper Amen god bless you may be seated
[18:06] and a little thought speaking on the an
[18:13] invitation and brother Branham says in
[18:21] the message God's provided way he says
[18:24] and we the bride or the one that's
[18:27] invited the bride would be the whole
[18:30] world is invited everybody's invited but
[18:32] there's some things that we've got to do
[18:34] before we can ever attend the wedding
[18:37] supper and he goes on talks about the
[18:39] Orient and how they when they hand out
[18:42] the invitations then they have to have
[18:44] the wedding garments and he says I don't
[18:46] believe that there has ever been a man
[18:48] or a woman that ever walked into a
[18:50] church or come into the presence of God
[18:52] without they were given an invitation to
[18:55] this supper now you can take it or you
[18:58] can turn it down
[18:59] that's up to you he says some people go
[19:02] to church year after year and day after
[19:04] day revival after revival and still not
[19:07] accept the invitation they don't mean to
[19:10] turn it down
[19:11] they just neglect doing it and he says
[19:14] the people say in Canaan go on he says
[19:18] and people say the people that's got the
[19:20] Holy Ghost brag too much about it he
[19:23] said we can't brag enough about it
[19:25] there's something to crow about we're
[19:26] invited to the wedding supper of the son
[19:29] of God it's worth walking on the street
[19:31] and testifying and telling every
[19:33] creature you come in contact with what a
[19:35] good thing it is that you're invited to
[19:38] the wedding supper God Almighty has
[19:40] selected you from the slums of the earth
[19:42] to attend the wedding supper of his
[19:44] beloved son Oh what an invitation that
[19:46] is it's worth a hundred billion
[19:48] president suppers to attend that suffer
[19:52] so and then continuing on and brother
[20:00] brems speaking on president eisenhower
[20:03] and having a you know being what a great
[20:06] thing it would be to be invited to the
[20:08] presidential supper and everything like
[20:10] that but he's talking about the
[20:12] being called and he says don't worry say
[20:15] well I've just been a lukewarm church
[20:18] member he will take care of it see you
[20:20] just heed to that invitation you say
[20:23] what is the invitation whosoever will
[20:25] let him come and drink of the waters of
[20:27] life really the invitation to whosoever
[20:31] will so I just wanted to start out with
[20:35] that this and you know we've been given
[20:39] a great opportunity and one of the
[20:42] things I was thinking about was you know
[20:46] just have just had my high school
[20:47] reunion and we were in North Carolina I
[20:50] was in North Carolina over the weekend
[20:53] and you know trying to trying to prep
[20:55] you know trying to prepare to have a
[20:57] reunion and you send out invitations or
[21:01] any kind of function where you're where
[21:03] you're sending out invitations you know
[21:05] it's it's a lot of work and you and
[21:07] there's a lot of planning involved but
[21:09] lots of times you get no response you
[21:14] know you and and just hearing the
[21:16] scripture you know this man is having
[21:18] this great wedding supper this great
[21:20] feast and he's having this great
[21:22] occasion and he's trying to get people
[21:24] to come in and nobody's interested and
[21:27] you know many people have heard but no
[21:30] but you know people don't respond you
[21:33] know we had this reunion in which people
[21:36] had many invitations that were given out
[21:38] and a little funny thing about Facebook
[21:42] is if you send out an invitation if you
[21:45] create a an invite the event on there
[21:49] and you sent out invitations if you get
[21:51] that invitation and you look at that
[21:53] invitation guess what the people that
[21:54] sent the invitations know that you've
[21:57] seen it and it's pretty amazing because
[22:02] you've got all these people and there's
[22:03] a number of people that never look at it
[22:05] a lot of people don't even know there's
[22:06] that function I don't think they even
[22:07] know that function exists on Facebook
[22:09] but a lot of people they've see it and
[22:12] you try to get in touch with them and
[22:14] they still don't contact you and it's
[22:17] like well I know you've seen it and you
[22:20] know and there's a lot of people you
[22:22] know they just say they just think well
[22:23] I may come
[22:25] I may come well you know all right are
[22:29] you gonna be if you're gonna decide in a
[22:32] week a month you know the day before
[22:34] when are you going to decide and your
[22:38] brother branham sit here you know it's
[22:39] not that people turn turned down that
[22:41] invitation he said they just neglect to
[22:43] do it and many people they pick that but
[22:46] they never decide yes or no or maybe or
[22:49] what but when it comes to time you know
[22:52] are you going to make that are you going
[22:54] to accept that invitation because an
[22:57] invitation is maiden and brother branham
[22:59] said that nobody has ever come to church
[23:02] that they hadn't heard and many people
[23:04] have received an invitation but have you
[23:06] accepted that invitation and it's not
[23:09] and it's not just that as brother Aaron
[23:11] was speaking of this wedding supper it's
[23:13] not just that we've come to a church and
[23:15] we've accepted the message or you know
[23:18] we've come to a certain spot but you
[23:19] know are you continuing home because
[23:22] that because that invitation is still
[23:24] given to you every every church service
[23:27] every day are you going to continue in
[23:29] the word are you continuing on you know
[23:32] one of the things that struck me is that
[23:34] I was listening to brother Ryan and
[23:38] Sunday school would and you know just
[23:41] how thoughts just come through your mind
[23:43] and just you know people's like how do
[23:45] you get from this point to that point
[23:46] well you know everybody's mind works a
[23:49] little different but you know everybody
[23:52] works in a different track you know but
[23:55] you know I was thinking you know we've
[23:56] had people that have heard the truth and
[23:58] you know I don't know I don't you know
[24:00] I'm not saying that they're not born
[24:02] again but I'm saying there's people in
[24:04] the message that have only stopped at a
[24:06] certain point you know and brother Brent
[24:08] them you know he nailed the Pentecostals
[24:11] he said because they cabbage down on the
[24:13] new birth they got to one point and they
[24:14] just stopped and he said you know he
[24:16] said they and we're going to I've got a
[24:18] quote to read later on but you know he
[24:20] said you know they have refused a
[24:22] further impregnation of the word they
[24:25] refused to go on it wasn't that the word
[24:28] wasn't there it wasn't they need to
[24:30] receive the invitation but they didn't
[24:32] receive it they didn't accept it and
[24:34] many times you know the word has went
[24:36] forth but what is a word
[24:38] we accept the invitation and you know
[24:42] many times you know when people talk
[24:44] about certain things they talk about an
[24:47] anointing you know is it just an
[24:51] anointing on a person or is it an
[24:54] indwelling no are we looking for an
[24:56] indwelling are we looking just to be
[24:57] anointed but you know many times people
[25:01] don't even know what they're asking for
[25:02] when they when they ask you you know
[25:04] because people pray to be anointed but
[25:06] what are you what are you really mean
[25:10] because people people don't even people
[25:12] are on you know they're confused about
[25:14] what they're really wanting and many
[25:18] times people have never even come to a
[25:20] place to actually find out what to even
[25:22] ask why they're you know to know what
[25:24] they're asking for or what they want to
[25:26] ask for it's like people trying to ask
[25:31] questions sometimes people say well I
[25:34] know what I want to say but I don't know
[25:35] how to say it we're gonna like
[25:38] struggling because there's something in
[25:39] their mind but they don't know how to
[25:40] phrase it for people to understand what
[25:42] they're wanting but I honestly believe
[25:49] the thing is is if you seek God then God
[25:52] will give you he will number one he put
[25:55] somebody behind this pulpit that can
[25:57] exactly answer your question will tell
[25:59] you exactly and you don't even have to
[26:00] ask but say the thing is a saying is the
[26:03] is the Holy Spirit on the inside or even
[26:06] if you're not born again but the Holy
[26:08] Spirit if the Holy Spirit is dealing
[26:10] with you then the Holy Spirit is there
[26:12] to lead you and you oh you got to do is
[26:14] pray to God and God will hit the spirit
[26:18] the Bible tells us that the Spirit will
[26:20] intervene for us because while the
[26:24] Spirit knows what you desire even though
[26:26] you may not know because it even makes
[26:28] groanings intercession for me that we
[26:30] don't understand but there's the Spirit
[26:32] is there but many times people don't
[26:36] ever get to the place where they
[26:37] actually sit down and just you know even
[26:40] if you know just sit and think and say
[26:44] lord I don't know what I won't I don't
[26:46] know what I need but you do
[26:48] yeah because you know if we go back to
[26:52] what Jesus said in the garden you know
[26:54] he said you know he said not my wheel
[26:56] Lord but thine be done
[26:58] you know because he had he had a
[27:00] situation that he did not want a face
[27:02] but you know he said Lord not my will
[27:04] but thine be done and many times we
[27:07] could just pray the same thing Lord I
[27:08] don't know what I need but you do and
[27:10] you just give me what I need Lord just
[27:12] fill me up because I'm searching for
[27:14] something you know I was listening to
[27:16] brother Brent and he was talking about
[27:17] in his life story you know he was trying
[27:19] to find God trying to nail something on
[27:22] the tree or you know trying to figure
[27:24] out exactly how to hold his hands trying
[27:26] to find out exactly how do you how do
[27:28] you communicate with God what is it but
[27:31] you know it was something on the inside
[27:33] that was reaching out but you know what
[27:35] he kept searching and he kept searching
[27:36] and he kept searching and you know what
[27:37] there came a time when the Holy Spirit
[27:39] come to him and spoke to him exactly
[27:41] what he had need of you know if we have
[27:46] if we have an invitation that's been
[27:47] given to us you know whatever it is the
[27:50] Holy Spirit is here to meet your need
[27:53] but do you have but you know the thing
[27:55] is it may be well maybe you have to get
[27:56] by yourself maybe we have to get along
[27:59] maybe we just need to separate and I
[28:04] know it's difficult there's not a
[28:07] minister in this building knows it any
[28:09] time you sit down to try to get a
[28:10] thought and try to get quiet that's when
[28:14] everybody else needs you it's just like
[28:20] you know it's you know you can have
[28:21] nothing on your mind you can sit there
[28:23] for for a solid hour and you can't get
[28:26] nothing it's just as dry and it's dead
[28:30] and it's cold as anything but let me
[28:34] tell you what the spirit of quicken
[28:36] something to you and before you can get
[28:38] a pen there'll be ten people in front of
[28:39] you trying to stop you and it's like
[28:42] y'all gotta get stops up something
[28:43] you're trying to remember exactly what
[28:45] come to your mind and it's just you know
[28:49] and it's the same way you try to pray
[28:53] pray and you know what you don't have
[28:56] nothing I mean you know you it's just
[28:59] going out your lips and falling down
[29:02] you know you just you're getting
[29:04] anything but as soon as soon as the
[29:07] spirit starts to move and it just feels
[29:08] like you're breaking into a room you're
[29:11] communicating with God it just feels
[29:12] like you the spirits starting to move I
[29:14] mean the phone rings there's always
[29:15] something your kids who need something
[29:17] it's always something going on even when
[29:21] you're at work and you the Bible says to
[29:23] pray without ceasing you know and you
[29:26] know a lot of people what does that mean
[29:30] means you it means you praying all the
[29:32] time you know I read what Stonewall
[29:39] Jackson said about that you know brother
[29:41] Bram said Stonewall Jackson said that he
[29:42] didn't take a drink of water with
[29:43] without thinking God about it do you
[29:46] know you if you read what Stonewall
[29:47] Jackson actually said you know he said
[29:49] he said it's just as natural as me to
[29:52] open my mouth to drink water he said
[29:54] that's how natural it was for me to
[29:56] thank God for the water
[29:57] he said it's become such a part of me he
[30:00] said I can't he said if I couldn't thank
[30:03] God for the water he saw I couldn't open
[30:05] my mouth it was just it was just that
[30:06] natural he said he said when I open a
[30:09] letter he said he said I prayed to God
[30:12] he said prepare me for the contents in
[30:14] this letter he said I pray for the
[30:15] person if I'm sending a letter he's the
[30:18] one who told at Virginia Military
[30:19] Institute he said before I went in the
[30:21] classroom he said I prayed for me and
[30:23] the students he said prepare them for
[30:25] the lecture and prepare me for them
[30:27] and everything and he said it was just
[30:29] natural just as natural as getting up
[30:31] out of bed and thanking God for the day
[30:33] it was just he said everything is just
[30:35] prayer hey someone because it was just
[30:38] because but if you do that everyday
[30:40] you're communicating with God and a lot
[30:43] of people they think that's so hard to
[30:45] do but sometimes we let little simple
[30:48] things you know confuse us or you think
[30:51] that's a big thing but it's not but if
[30:55] we can just communicate with God God's
[30:57] there to meet our need and speak to us
[31:00] but I know sometimes it's just like it
[31:02] work you try to you know you go around
[31:04] and there's times where I'm just hadn't
[31:08] been as much now but you know in the
[31:12] past it's just been me and the birds on
[31:14] the roof
[31:15] you know working on air conditioners is
[31:17] not a whole lot around but being the
[31:19] birds and in the bug sometimes but you
[31:23] know and just pray you know and it's
[31:28] just a wonderful time sometimes it's
[31:29] just human God but you know sometimes
[31:33] it's when the Lord goes to speak to you
[31:34] that's when that's when ever you know
[31:36] you start having problems and that was
[31:39] there you know because he knows when
[31:40] God's trying to speak to you and you
[31:45] know sometimes people take that as well
[31:47] you know the Lord didn't want me to have
[31:48] that no sometimes that's what the Lord
[31:49] that's when the Lord is really trying to
[31:51] give you something and the devil knows
[31:53] that the Lord's trying to speak to you
[31:55] and he don't want you to do that he
[31:58] wants to get in your way that's reason
[32:01] we have to keep pressing the battle but
[32:04] the devil the devil is there to stop us
[32:06] but we have to keep pressing but God is
[32:10] there to meet our need he's there and
[32:12] he's in and you know he is always
[32:14] welcoming and it's up to us to welcome
[32:19] that invitation there's like we've been
[32:29] reading the scripture about grieve not
[32:33] this the Spirit of God you know he's
[32:37] there but many times it's us that grieve
[32:39] him away
[32:40] today's there to speak to us and wanting
[32:43] to speak to us and can we you know so
[32:46] what can we make time for him and open
[32:49] up because that's the greatest thing to
[32:52] hear from God because God wants to speak
[32:55] to us but you know he's made that
[32:58] invitation but you know the invitation
[33:00] is went out but it's it's wherever
[33:03] you're at God has an invitation for you
[33:06] to come up a little bit higher to
[33:08] continue on but you many people you know
[33:12] that they have failed and you know
[33:15] something some people just get to
[33:16] justification or they get to
[33:18] sanctification or they you know they get
[33:20] to a certain spot you know it's sad
[33:25] because there are people God God has
[33:27] placed people
[33:28] you know and whether anybody believes it
[33:31] or not and likes it or what you know but
[33:33] I believe we have this one of the
[33:34] greatest ministries on the face of the
[33:37] earth here now know everything you know
[33:41] people you know I know people think you
[33:44] know you shouldn't brag or whatever you
[33:46] know that's all right if I did if I
[33:48] didn't if I didn't think this was great
[33:50] I'd go somewhere else I'd find someplace
[33:52] else to be but you know the thing is is
[33:56] when we see people and if it don't break
[34:00] your heart I don't I don't know what
[34:01] will
[34:02] but you know there there's people that
[34:04] have been around and heard this
[34:06] invitation that's heard the word and and
[34:10] you know and even had people that
[34:12] actually said these things out of their
[34:14] mouth talk about how great the ministry
[34:16] isn't you know what never darken the
[34:18] door yeah
[34:19] never it never come around and you know
[34:25] it's set up and you know I've been
[34:31] trying to last last a little while I've
[34:34] been listening to brother Dale seals
[34:35] I've been in the truck I just been
[34:38] trying to keep lit you know keep
[34:40] listening to them but you know it it's
[34:43] amazing to see you know all these years
[34:46] and you know I it really means something
[34:53] to me but you know I think I was a kid
[34:54] when brother Dale was preaching all this
[34:56] but you go in there and you hear what he
[34:58] has to say and it's just so illuminating
[35:00] sometimes and you know and and it's to
[35:03] see what what has happened and that
[35:06] people have not taken this the word
[35:09] that's been preached and and in in
[35:12] Matthew chapter 22 when in the marriage
[35:16] and the scripture that talks about this
[35:20] this marriage feast you know the
[35:22] scripture says that they made light of
[35:25] his invitation and not only did they
[35:30] make light of his invitation but his
[35:32] they killed his servants and destroyed
[35:34] everything and you know I said that this
[35:38] great invitation has been made and been
[35:41] given and you know
[35:42] people have not received it and you know
[35:45] and we can fall in that same same
[35:48] category but you always sad to see how
[35:50] many people have not received it and I
[35:53] think it's I think it's wonderful
[35:56] I you know it's changed my life and I'm
[36:00] not and it's not a man and it's not it's
[36:05] not men it's not flesh but I believe
[36:09] it's been the Spirit of God I believe I
[36:12] believe the Spirit of God has come why
[36:14] because that's exactly what the Prophet
[36:16] told us was going to do what's going to
[36:18] take place why because he you know and
[36:20] and people say well you know we need to
[36:23] stay away from them do things that we
[36:24] just need to get down where we live well
[36:26] let me tell you something and then you
[36:28] know I I have a hard time with that
[36:30] statement because let me tell you
[36:32] something down where we live is exactly
[36:35] what the seals and the 70 weeks of
[36:37] Daniel and all of these other things
[36:39] exactly what they come to do is get down
[36:42] exactly where you live that is exactly
[36:45] where you live
[36:46] why because you're still living in this
[36:48] past house still under the bondage of
[36:51] Satan while this flesh you're still
[36:52] going to have all of the whole Satan
[36:55] still got a hold on you one because if
[36:57] we don't come to us to the place where
[37:00] we can overcome death then you know I
[37:02] will go to the grave none of it none of
[37:05] us are promised the rest of this day or
[37:08] tomorrow but there's been a word been
[37:10] given to us that we can overcome the
[37:13] power of Satan and come overcome death
[37:18] but he's so we got to get down where we
[37:20] live we're gonna know what every day
[37:22] you're getting older you know I might
[37:28] have a whole bunch of metal in this arm
[37:30] right here but you know I'm not taking
[37:32] it with me you know what I mean because
[37:35] there's some things that happen in life
[37:37] and we don't know why but you know what
[37:39] the Bible tells me that all things work
[37:42] together for the good to them that love
[37:44] the Lord who RV called according to his
[37:46] purpose somebody asked me so why is it
[37:49] that you broke your arm
[37:50] why because I can testify and show the
[37:53] healing power of Jesus Christ
[37:55] why because I can walk into a place and
[37:57] people be amazed at how well I've come
[37:59] and I said you know what mister because
[38:01] of the prayer because it's faith in
[38:02] Jesus Christ because it's why His Word
[38:04] says that I'm by strikes I'm healed you
[38:07] know what he didn't become he didn't
[38:08] come overnight he won the miracle but
[38:10] that's not divine healing divine healing
[38:12] is a process divine healing takes time
[38:15] but the thing is is can you see because
[38:17] when people come up to you and they're
[38:18] amazed at your progress that's the power
[38:21] of God and that's and that's what we
[38:26] face today that's what we have today but
[38:29] let me tell you something it's not just
[38:30] healings it's not just miracles it's not
[38:33] just signs but it's the opening of the
[38:35] word why because there's one thing they
[38:38] you can have people who can do lots of
[38:41] miracles and signs and there's lots of
[38:43] healing take place but there's one thing
[38:44] they can't reproduce there's one thing
[38:46] the devil can't impersonate and that's
[38:47] the opening of the word he can't copy
[38:50] that there's anything is this do we take
[38:53] the word do we take the word and
[38:55] actually apply it to our lives this is
[39:03] from the message is your life worthy of
[39:05] the gospel brother Branham says now
[39:08] Jesus here is saying man has tried to
[39:10] make excuses not to receive God's word
[39:12] of his invitation he said though it be
[39:15] proved firmly proven to them it's his
[39:20] supper and his invitation but man
[39:21] constantly making excuses and he says if
[39:24] you may read Matthew 22 you'll find the
[39:26] excuses and and he goes on and talks
[39:27] about what's happened and he said drops
[39:30] down he says now we see when God gives a
[39:32] man an invitation to do something or
[39:34] receive the invitation that he's given
[39:36] him and he returns it down there's
[39:39] nothing left after mercy is spurred but
[39:41] judgment he said if he step over the
[39:44] boundaries of mercy then there's only
[39:46] one thing left and that is judgment and
[39:49] we find that man has done that in all
[39:51] the ages it happens most every age in
[39:54] the Bible but you know he's given us
[40:01] that invitation to receive the word
[40:07] nevah and you know we know that as you
[40:10] receive the words you become the word we
[40:12] become the word and what what is it what
[40:15] is it for us to do is because we are to
[40:17] be manifest because brother Bram says it
[40:19] that God wanted to be to be made
[40:21] manifest so Christ came to be
[40:23] the fullness of the Godhead bodily and
[40:26] flesh on the earth and he said the bride
[40:28] became an extension of that or brought
[40:32] Christ in another form became he said
[40:35] because Christ was the word that he said
[40:37] the bride is to the bride is to be
[40:39] manifest why because what what Christ
[40:41] come to manifest he said I do nothing
[40:44] except what I see the father do
[40:46] he said the son can do nothing in
[40:48] himself he said big self what he sees
[40:50] the father do
[40:51] he said that doeth the son likewise and
[40:53] he said that's what applies to the bride
[40:55] because the same word that applies to
[40:58] the bridegroom also applies to the bride
[41:00] so if what he spoke of Jesus because
[41:03] Jesus said I come to make him known and
[41:06] that's what the bride is to make known
[41:08] is to make him known well because that
[41:13] is that is then the day that we live one
[41:15] because that's what he wants to be made
[41:16] known because what he spoke of is that
[41:20] Jesus Christ will be here on the earth
[41:22] again but many times when we when we say
[41:27] that you know well is that just in part
[41:30] are we just seeing part of that or do we
[41:33] actually see do we realize that the body
[41:36] is to manifest the whole Jesus Christ in
[41:41] his fullness and I mean I may not be the
[41:46] one that's going to express him in his
[41:48] fullness but I want to be the fullness
[41:49] of my part because you know I see when
[41:55] you understand when when brethren said
[41:59] that all that God was he poured into
[42:01] Christ when you understand what what
[42:03] eternity is when you understand the
[42:05] eternal when when you see these things
[42:07] and maybe I don't see it the way out -
[42:09] but I see what I see I'm I live in that
[42:13] but you know it's when you see when you
[42:16] see something that's eternal and you
[42:18] know we talk about something being
[42:19] infinite
[42:20] well you know the thing is is you know
[42:22] when he said all that God was he poured
[42:24] into Christ well if something that's
[42:26] infinite you can you can divide what you
[42:28] can do whatever you won't do to it and
[42:29] it doesn't diminish it he said when he
[42:32] said all that God was he poured into
[42:34] Christ were you know what that became
[42:36] another form of seeing the infinite God
[42:39] but you know what he didn't diminish him
[42:40] in any capacity all he done was you know
[42:44] you're seeing him in a greater form
[42:46] you're seeing him in a greater way and
[42:48] then when he pours it into the bride the
[42:50] bride doesn't diminish him he said
[42:52] you're seeing Jesus Christ in a greater
[42:53] way so when we come to church brothers
[42:56] and sisters when we see a brother or
[42:58] sister that's coming into the and has
[43:00] come into this folders come into this
[43:01] fellowship then you know what it's a
[43:03] great thing one because I'm seeing Jesus
[43:05] Christ in a greater form I've seen Jesus
[43:08] Christ in a greater manifestation now we
[43:13] can look at each other's faults and
[43:15] failures and see all the warts and all
[43:16] the other bad things and and look at the
[43:18] the honda parts as the scripture says
[43:20] but you know what we can also see Jesus
[43:23] Christ being made manifest in a person
[43:29] if we can you know wasn't the last time
[43:32] I preached I was talking about the the
[43:34] great family reunion you know the we are
[43:39] we are we thrilled and I understand what
[43:42] brother Branham said you know he said if
[43:44] if you have the Spirit of God inside of
[43:46] he said you can't wait to get into those
[43:48] doors and to fellowship with your
[43:49] brothers and sisters you know you can't
[43:52] wait to fellowship with people and it's
[43:54] not just here but I mean actually just
[43:56] fellowship with the brothers and sisters
[43:58] in Christ no matter where it is
[44:08] and you know when I went to my high
[44:12] school reunion it was it was nice to see
[44:14] them to see people and and there were
[44:16] people that I got to see and we got to
[44:18] fellowship with and and you know it's
[44:21] just almost like time hadn't passed I
[44:23] mean it's just like we're all wait ten
[44:25] years old again I mean it's just you
[44:28] know it's so great but you know what I
[44:31] sit there and you know what there's
[44:33] nothing in this realm because you sit
[44:37] there and even as great as that reunion
[44:39] was to see these people you know what it
[44:43] doesn't it doesn't compare to having
[44:45] your brothers and sisters in Christ even
[44:49] to meet somebody that you've never seen
[44:51] in this flesh and you know one of the
[44:55] one of the people that really stands out
[44:56] to me as brother sampson shetty and the
[44:58] first time he coming you know it was
[45:00] just like it was just like we just just
[45:02] bonded the first time I ever met him and
[45:05] you know it's just it's just something

[46:14] waiting Otis is to get together with our
[46:16] brothers and sisters but you know that
[46:21] that's the time that we're in now is you
[46:24] know he stirs you up sometimes we go you
[46:28] know that's that's a wonderful thing to
[46:29] realize because you know I'm ready to
[46:32] get out of here I'm ready to put all
[46:35] this behind me you know how many want to
[46:40] get up and go to work in the morning
[46:41] yeah I'm ready put all that behind me
[46:45] you know all right you know even even
[46:48] just to get out in the just getting out
[46:50] of bed in the morning you know just
[46:52] having to do with any of the the things
[46:54] that we have to do deal with and all in
[46:56] this pest house having to get old and
[47:00] you know problems and everything I'm
[47:03] ready to put all that behind us but
[47:14] brother Grimm says in the mrs. endtime
[47:17] Sun seed he says we believe that Christ
[47:23] is God's Word made manifest we believe
[47:25] that his bride must be the same thing we
[47:27] believe that she must believe every bit
[47:30] of the word and have that word in her
[47:32] because she is part of the body
[47:34] she is the body where he is the head he
[47:39] said when he died rose from the dead and
[47:40] resurrect and set on high by the majesty
[47:42] of God on his throne right hand of the
[47:44] Majesty then we are his delegate so we
[47:46] reckon ourselves dead and buried by
[47:49] baptism and raised with him and now
[47:51] seated together with him in heavenly
[47:53] places in Christ Jesus that get us all
[47:57] shouting wouldn't it think of that we
[48:00] are not will be we are now we are sons
[48:03] of God now we are daughters of God not
[48:07] we will be seated we are now seated hey
[48:13] you know many times it says that we are
[48:16] reckon ourselves dead with him you know
[48:20] mate how we get in our in our in our
[48:23] lives and you know there's people that
[48:25] you know that they wonder if you know if
[48:28] they're doing anything for God or can
[48:30] they do anything for God or you know you
[48:32] know because they see people's you know
[48:35] they don't have a great ministry or they
[48:36] don't get to do certain things or
[48:38] whatever but you know are you faithful
[48:40] in what God's called you to be you know
[48:43] because when brother Ram talks about the
[48:44] great things in God he said you know
[48:46] it's just a wash woman washing clothes
[48:48] or a man going to work you know these
[48:50] type things do can't people see Christ
[48:52] in you and you know there's a as a story
[48:56] and I've told this story before and and
[48:57] it always it always stands out to me and
[49:01] you know there was a in the second world
[49:05] world war it was a the Allies had a
[49:10] campaign and they were trying to feed
[49:12] false information to the enemy and they
[49:14] couldn't do it so somebody come up with
[49:16] an idea that the way they wanted to do
[49:20] it was they wanted to take a dead man
[49:22] and faked his you know faked his death
[49:25] like he was a soldier and everything and
[49:27] he
[49:28] was supposed to have these papers on him
[49:29] and that Hitler and the Axis powers they
[49:33] would get these papers from from this
[49:35] dead man and they would take them and
[49:37] you know they would try to decipher them
[49:39] and they would think all this stuff well
[49:42] they kept trying to find a man and they
[49:46] made it look like the man had drowned
[49:49] well they the man had actually died of
[49:50] pneumonia and they took this man and
[49:52] what was so amazing about this man was
[49:57] this man in his life he felt like he
[50:02] never never amounted to anything and you
[50:06] know it was just the the mindset that he
[50:09] had in his life it end up killing him
[50:12] because you know what he never believed
[50:14] he could mount to anything and
[50:16] everything was against him and he had
[50:19] all these problems and you know what he
[50:21] ended up dying and you know what when
[50:23] this man died the Allied powers of the
[50:28] world took this dead man they dressed
[50:32] him up in an army uniform they gave him
[50:35] a new name they gave him all these
[50:38] different classifications and everything
[50:41] they took him they threw him in the
[50:42] ocean well next thing you know all these
[50:44] access powers these different foreign
[50:46] governments they're out there finding
[50:48] him and they start pulling them in they
[50:50] sell these papers like oh man we've
[50:51] rarely found something well the Allied
[50:54] Zhou lay down would start sending their
[50:55] spies around trying to find out trying
[50:58] to make like they were really searching
[50:59] for these papers well the enemy thought
[51:01] men they were really wanting these
[51:02] papers they must be something of value
[51:05] well they go and get these papers and
[51:07] Hitler actually believes these papers
[51:09] are really real but actually it come to
[51:12] be false but you know what they actually
[51:14] took those and it actually helped when
[51:17] we had the Normandy landing on d-day it
[51:20] actually led to that Hitler moving his
[51:24] troops out of the way so that they could
[51:25] actually land in certain areas and it
[51:29] was so amazing was this man he thought
[51:31] that he'd never amount to anything
[51:33] he couldn't do anything but you know
[51:35] what when that man died he could
[51:37] actually be something and actually be
[51:39] used to somebody and
[51:42] I always think of that you know because
[51:43] you know what our problem is is we're
[51:45] not dead we want to be used of God but
[51:48] you know what until you doubt God can't
[51:50] use you and you know other thing is is
[51:52] when you die you can get a new name you
[51:55] can get put in the army of God and God
[51:57] can use you but the thing is is you've
[51:58] got to die out why because as long as
[52:02] we're still alive we still got the old
[52:04] mindset we still got our stinking
[52:06] thinking that come from creation but the
[52:08] thing is is went from our first birth
[52:11] but the thing is is when we die old
[52:12] we'll get a get a rebirth that we get a
[52:14] new way of thinking we've got a new
[52:16] thought one because we can have the mind
[52:18] of Christ and if we can be used of God
[52:27] so that's our that's the whole problem
[52:29] is our we did have we died out because
[52:35] when I'm dead you know what did Christ
[52:37] may live yeah and I always think about
[52:41] that Lord just make sure I'm dead just
[52:44] kill me I want to be dead why because I
[52:48] can be used of God
[52:57] I just use me the way you'd have me this
[53:05] is from uniting uniting time and sign
[53:10] and brother Brent says What did he say
[53:13] in Malachi 4 would restore restore back
[53:17] the original Pentecostal faith back to
[53:18] the people with the same Pentecostal
[53:20] message the same Pentecostal signed the
[53:22] painting
[53:23] saying Pentecostal evidence the same God
[53:25] the same power the same teaching
[53:27] everything exactly with the vindication
[53:29] of the same pillar fire that struck Paul
[53:31] down on the road down to Damascus among
[53:34] us today doing the same things he did
[53:36] that day uniting we see with the
[53:40] nation's uniting we see the world
[53:41] uniting we see the church is uniting we
[53:43] see the bride uniting uniting with the
[53:45] word why the word is God and has the
[53:47] word as the bridegroom being the word
[53:49] and the bride being the hearer of the
[53:50] word they come together in a union they
[53:53] new unite to using like a wedding see
[53:56] they're becoming they're getting ready
[53:58] for a wedding and they become one the
[54:01] word becomes you and you become the word
[54:03] jesus said at that day you know what all
[54:06] the father is I am and all I am you are
[54:08] and all you are I am in that day you'll
[54:12] know that I'm in the father the father
[54:13] in me ayane you and you and me see at
[54:16] that day one day this day we find out
[54:19] the great hidden mysteries of God being
[54:21] revealed oh how I like that
[54:25] well because it's this day that we
[54:28] become the word that we can see that's
[54:33] what he's made us and we've received an
[54:38] invitation to become to this place but
[54:42] we must receive it
[54:49] I want to skip down here the message
[54:52] identification brother Ram says this is
[54:56] from 1964 message identification and
[54:59] brother Branham says and his character
[55:01] was that he did everything that please
[55:03] God and he stayed with the word that's
[55:05] what he wanted us for too he'd stay we'd
[55:08] stay with God's Word find our place and
[55:10] then know where we where we had staying
[55:14] with his word and think of it we are
[55:17] invited to shape our own character to
[55:19] his now we're going to find out what
[55:22] we've done shape our character to his
[55:25] own by his own spirit then we buy him
[55:28] our sons of God just what I've expressed
[55:31] by having his mind in us to shape our
[55:33] character to his his mind let the mind
[55:36] that was in Christ being you and then he
[55:40] says he continues on says now if you
[55:41] find your place sister don't let me hurt
[55:44] you or brother but you'll find your
[55:46] place in the word as a Christian not
[55:48] what the Creed said that's down here and
[55:50] this lower cannon-fodder that's going to
[55:52] be destroyed you see you find your place
[55:54] as a Christian because your character is
[55:56] molded as Christ and continues on here
[55:59] he says you're invited to come and take
[56:02] his character by having his character in
[56:04] you it mold you into the same mind that
[56:07] he was and his mind was always to do the
[56:10] father had ordained him to do what the
[56:12] father had ordained him to do he said
[56:14] search the scripture they testify of me
[56:16] in other words if I don't do exactly
[56:18] what the scripture said I'm to do then
[56:21] show me where and then I want this is
[56:27] from identification in 1963 brem says
[56:32] and we are invited to shape our own
[56:35] character too he is by His grace we are
[56:38] invited think of it to become characters
[56:41] like he is if we are ready to lay our
[56:43] character down and the molding that we
[56:46] had heady highminded lovers of pleasures
[56:48] more than lovers of God false accusers
[56:50] incontinent despisers of those that are
[56:53] trying to do right having a form of
[56:55] godliness and denying the power of the
[56:57] word how can God come into a place like
[57:00] that when they deny the word when
[57:02] he watches over his word to vindicate it
[57:05] to make it come to pass and the word is
[57:08] pushed out how can he identify himself
[57:10] with something like that he said we've
[57:14] got to take the entire Full Gospel we
[57:16] must and now being that we have
[57:17] identified ourselves as Full Gospel
[57:19] people let's mold our character we're
[57:22] invited to be molded in His image that
[57:25] we might reflect his presence and the
[57:27] works that I do shall you do also the
[57:30] life that I live so shall you we're
[57:32] invited by God to take him as an example
[57:35] and let our character be molded like he
[57:37] is what a thing my then when we let his
[57:40] character be in us then we have become
[57:43] sons by having the mind of Christ mind
[57:46] which is his character your mind makes
[57:49] your character let the mind Paul said of
[57:51] Christ this mind that was in Christ
[57:53] being you let that mind of Christ being
[57:56] you it molds the character of a son of
[57:58] God so we've been invited and that's
[58:04] what strumming we've been invited to
[58:06] have our character molded like he is but
[58:09] you know the thing is as you've got to
[58:10] accept that invitation that is but he's
[58:13] invited you to have yourself molded just
[58:15] like Kingdom because you know many times
[58:17] we've come to a certain spot but the
[58:19] thing is is have we accepted the
[58:21] invitation to come up higher or to
[58:23] continue on because wherever you stop
[58:25] there's a place you know where is it
[58:27] that you want to go there's an
[58:28] invitation for that well because if
[58:31] there's a if there's a higher place in
[58:32] God or a deeper place in God then
[58:34] there's an invitation that's already
[58:35] been given to us to come to that place
[58:37] and the thing is whatever you have need
[58:40] of their invitation has been given to
[58:42] you to receive that and so for us to
[58:48] become the word to make the word and
[58:50] manifest just as Jesus was the word made
[58:52] manifest that's what he wants us to be
[58:55] and we have been invited to that
[59:08] and this is from the spoken word is
[59:10] original seed he said then from a little
[59:15] group of the true seed of the word God
[59:17] will present Christ a beloved bride a
[59:19] virgin a virgin of his word and through
[59:21] them and by them will be fulfilled all
[59:24] that has been promised for his word in
[59:26] the Virgin who knows no man-made creed
[59:28] or dogmas a word of promise in himself
[59:31] like it was in Mary God Himself made
[59:34] manifest he will act himself by his own
[59:37] word of promise so to fulfill all that
[59:39] had been written of him as he did when
[59:42] he came from the Virgin Moon type of the
[59:44] Spirit womb now so will the Virgin now
[59:47] accept his word be it unto me as thou
[59:50] hast said and says though it was said by
[59:57] an angel yet it was written it was the
[1:00:00] written word Isaiah 9:6 and continuing
[1:00:04] on he says notice what harmony Jesus
[1:00:07] never did anything until he seen the
[1:00:09] father or the father showed him first
[1:00:12] harmony between God and Christ see John
[1:00:14] 5:19 so will the bride and he shows her
[1:00:17] his word of life he shows her and she
[1:00:19] receives it she never doubts it nothing
[1:00:22] can harm her not even death for if the
[1:00:24] seed be planted the water will raise it
[1:00:26] up again amen then I've got a big
[1:00:28] hallelujah here is the secret the word
[1:00:30] is in the bride and the mind of Christ
[1:00:32] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:00:34] and she does it in his name she has thus
[1:00:37] saith the Lord then it is germanized so
[1:00:39] the Holy Spirit waters it until it has
[1:00:42] grown and serves it purpose amen so God
[1:00:49] has given us an invitation to Coe and be
[1:00:53] molded into his character and to receive
[1:00:56] the word that we can become what he is
[1:00:59] to be the full manifestation of him in
[1:01:02] this last days and it says nothing can
[1:01:09] hurt her not even death and the promise
[1:01:14] is as as he said when the when the bride
[1:01:18] he said when the bride recognizes who
[1:01:21] she is she'll be an invincible army he
[1:01:25] said she'll know what she what he wants
[1:01:27] done with the word why because that's
[1:01:30] what the word came to do for us to for
[1:01:33] him to show us exactly what needs to be
[1:01:36] done in our day because there's going to
[1:01:41] be a group that's gonna take a body
[1:01:42] change you know and that's and it's come
[1:01:47] to our day this is our day and I think
[1:01:51] the Lord because I can I can see that
[1:01:53] this is the day that we're living in
[1:01:57] when you when you see that all the
[1:01:59] things that the Scriptures talked about
[1:02:01] is talked about the end time and this is
[1:02:04] the day that we live in it's a great day
[1:02:06] to be living so let's all stand this

[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:11:07] what have I done to deserve such glory
[1:11:13] revealed to me
[1:11:17] thanks for my despair
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:23] when I saw your glorious love
[1:11:28] come face-to-face
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:38] not even in my wildest dreams didn't
[1:11:45] even see such things as the coming
[1:11:53] the rapture
[1:11:59] I have heard but now I see God and
[1:12:06] simplicity the spoken word is the
[1:12:12] original seed and Lorna
[1:12:17] [Music]
[1:12:33] to deserve such glory revealed to me
[1:12:40] [Music]
[1:12:43] special night when I saw your glorious
[1:12:49] light come face to face
[1:12:52] Willie turn
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:05] let's go go say something come to me
[1:13:09] brother Wade was reading a reading quote
[1:13:12] from brother Brown some time back and he
[1:13:13] was talking about a crystal he said you
[1:13:16] know you got to tune that crystal just
[1:13:17] right to receive he said the signals are
[1:13:19] everywhere be he said that crystal gets
[1:13:21] tied in and it picks that signal up and
[1:13:24] there's one thing that struck me when he
[1:13:25] was saying that when he was singing that
[1:13:28] song about seeing these things you know
[1:13:30] the when when you have an electrical
[1:13:33] circuit so it's like a radio you know
[1:13:37] when it when it strikes that signal and
[1:13:39] it hits that crystal you know there's a
[1:13:42] there's a a physical phenomenon and it's
[1:13:47] called resonance and I preached the
[1:13:49] message years ago called the resonance
[1:13:50] of the word and you know the thing is
[1:13:52] when you have resonance even in physics
[1:13:55] for instance you can take a a tube of
[1:13:58] water and have a tuning fork and I was
[1:14:00] go ever done done that before you hit
[1:14:02] that tuning fork and when the tuning
[1:14:04] fork the waves off the tuning fork are
[1:14:06] hitting the the water in the tube well
[1:14:08] when that thing gets filled up to a
[1:14:10] certain level when you get it just right
[1:14:13] that tuning fork you can't hear it but
[1:14:17] when it hits that tube with that water
[1:14:19] the whole room can hear it and it's just
[1:14:23] the same with electrical circuit when
[1:14:24] you get resonance because you've got
[1:14:26] capacitance inductance and different
[1:14:28] things that's reflecting and you know
[1:14:30] that's reason you trying to tune it just
[1:14:33] to get in but let me tell you something
[1:14:34] when you hit when you hit resonance and
[1:14:37] that means that circuit is balanced and
[1:14:38] it's perfect then you know what you have
[1:14:41] a perfectly clear signal and the thing
[1:14:43] is as you know it's when when guys just
[1:14:45] wasn't God wanting us to reach that that
[1:14:48] that wave to hit the crystal but he
[1:14:52] wanted us to know I just sit there
[1:14:55] receive it but we're supposed to make it
[1:14:56] manifest so it's just like that that's
[1:14:59] radio when it when it hits the sound
[1:15:01] it's not just sitting there holding it
[1:15:03] it manifested why because it amplifies
[1:15:06] it one because that's what the circuit
[1:15:07] is supposed to do
[1:15:08] when you have something that's when you
[1:15:10] that's the reason that you're supposed
[1:15:11] to stay balanced in the word one because
[1:15:13] God has come to balance us to obey it to
[1:15:16] put us right where we need to be in the
[1:15:18] word because that will bring us to
[1:15:20] biblical scriptural resonance why
[1:15:22] because when you reach that point then
[1:15:24] you'll manifest exactly what you have
[1:15:26] that you've received and the perfect
[1:15:31] revelation the period to be the
[1:15:33] vindication of the perfect revelation
[1:15:36] and you know it's just like when God
[1:15:38] shows us these things it's not just so
[1:15:40] for us to have head knowledge it's not
[1:15:42] just so we know something more than the
[1:15:44] Baptist's do or the Pentecostals or
[1:15:46] somebody else know it's us to be make
[1:15:47] make manifest Jesus Christ and I just
[1:15:53] want to be just like that so thank the
[1:15:57] Lord for but you know I just want to
[1:16:00] thank the Lord for what what I've been
[1:16:02] able to see and hear you know just like
[1:16:06] you said he he didn't have to do that
[1:16:09] but it was his grace to us amen
[1:16:13] well god bless you tonight as we go
[1:16:14] we're going as anybody have any
[1:16:18] announcements or anything
[1:16:20] Oh minds hearts clear so we'll be
[1:16:23] December the 28th December the 28th
[1:16:27] October 28th
[1:16:31] see oh it's just like just like brother
[1:16:33] Dale said a long time ago he said I say
[1:16:34] things wrong so y'all will remember them
[1:16:39] so the thing is you know everybody
[1:16:41] should remember what the date was cuz
[1:16:42] wait
[1:16:43] done that for y'all's benefit and y'all
[1:16:48] thought he had it wrong but he was
[1:16:49] actually he was just trying to make you
[1:16:50] think that he didn't know what he's
[1:16:51] talking about but it's actually for
[1:16:52] y'all's benefit so hey I tried I tried
[1:16:56] to help you best a good amen well god
[1:17:00] bless you tonight
[1:17:02] Lord willing we're gonna be and we're
[1:17:04] gonna be in North Carolina this weekend
[1:17:06] we're gonna be a brother team you missed
[1:17:07] church for the for the meetings so y'all
[1:17:11] just pray for us and we're gonna be
[1:17:13] looking forward to a good time there
[1:17:17] anybody else anything so all right well
[1:17:21] Lord bless Shane we're gonna have a
[1:17:22] brother Kyle if you don't mind dismiss
[1:17:23] us in prayer brother
[1:18:21] but you dismissed
[1:18:25] [Music]
