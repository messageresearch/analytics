[27:30] 6 Ephesians
[27:32] 2 and Romans 6 brother Joe gave me a
[27:37] quote off of a message there while ago
[27:39] where I was talking about this morning
[27:41] about that God is not up in heaven you
[27:43] know that's in Deuteronomy 30 there U
[27:46] that TI us you know we don't need
[27:47] somebody to go up and get him he's
[27:50] here so this is off of a message called
[27:53] deity of Christ Jesus Christ in 1949
[27:58] um
[28:02] 12:25 and that same power that same
[28:05] Christ Hallelujah let the
[28:06] fundamentalists let them people who deny
[28:08] the power of God say it's wrong but that
[28:11] same power that spoke the world into
[28:14] existence is in those people that's got
[28:16] the Holy Ghost that's right men and
[28:19] women it's time that we found out who
[28:23] you are the devil's trying to hide you
[28:26] back tell you that you're some little
[28:29] draw down something you're not you're
[28:32] Sons and Daughters of God the deity is
[28:35] not in heaven it's in you amen okay I
[28:41] know you think I'm crazy but let me tell
[28:43] you something brother when you realize
[28:45] that almighty God lives in you it's all
[28:48] right my life I give Zoe the life of God
[28:51] is in the human being amen so he's not
[28:54] in heaven he's here in he
[28:57] amen got your scriptures Ephesians 2
[29:00] Romans 6 father we thank you for your
[29:03] love and your grace and thank you for
[29:06] the opportunity to be able to stand here
[29:08] before the purchase of your blood today
[29:10] and talk to your people about what
[29:12] you've revealed into our heart and what
[29:13] you want to be said we pray that you
[29:16] would just have the preeminence in each
[29:18] and every one of us guide us now bless
[29:20] those that are not here and when they
[29:23] hear the tape you bless them also Lord
[29:25] we love you and we commit everything
[29:27] into your hands now that father you
[29:30] would come on the scene in each one of
[29:31] our hearts and lives because as we've
[29:34] talked about you for many many services
[29:37] you're not off up in heaven you're here
[29:39] so now it's time for us to realize that
[29:42] and to walk therein have your way now
[29:45] and keep us in Jesus name amen amen
[29:49] Ephesians
[29:51] 2 we'll go 1 through n and then we'll go
[29:54] to Romans
[29:56] 6 and and you hath he quickened who were
[29:58] dead in trespasses and sins wherein in
[30:01] time pass you walked according to the
[30:03] course of this world according to the
[30:06] prince of the power of the hour the
[30:08] spirit that now worketh in the children
[30:09] of
[30:10] Disobedience among whom also we all had
[30:14] our conversation in time past in the
[30:16] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[30:19] of the Flesh and of the mind but were by
[30:22] Nature the children of Wrath excuse and
[30:25] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[30:27] even as others but God who is rich in
[30:30] Mercy for his great love wherewith he
[30:33] loved us even when we were dead in sins
[30:37] hath quickened us together with Christ
[30:41] by Grace you are saved and have raised
[30:43] us up together and made us sit together
[30:46] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that
[30:49] in the ages to come he might show the
[30:51] exceeding Riches of his grace and his
[30:53] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[30:57] for by Grace you are saved through faith
[30:59] and that not of yourself it is the gift
[31:01] of God not of Works lest any man should
[31:06] boast all right let's go into R back to
[31:09] Romans
[31:10] then
[31:12] 6 just one verse verse
[31:15] 10 for in that he died he died under sin
[31:20] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[31:24] unto God you may be seated Lord at
[31:27] blessing to the reading of the
[31:31] word I hope you enjoyed
[31:34] the series we tried to put in on the
[31:37] coming of the Lord and this is not a
[31:41] backing up this is a going forward
[31:44] because remember the message we talked
[31:46] about or where we were at this morning
[31:48] that brother Brandon was talking about
[31:50] that the in Christ the mystery how that
[31:53] the uh head and body would
[31:56] Unite in the last days to bring the
[31:58] message well then I think it's about
[32:02] time to tell the message we're trying to
[32:04] bring because uh you know to bring that
[32:08] brother Ram was a prophet that's part of
[32:10] it yes we believe that because without
[32:11] him we wouldn't have no we would have no
[32:13] hes whatsoever so we put all of that
[32:16] into where that God kept his word about
[32:18] fulfilling Malachi 4 but now if he
[32:21] fulfill Malachi 4 then would he not
[32:23] fulfill all of the
[32:26] scriptures
[32:28] now because he you say well he he he he
[32:31] done it for brother R but I don't know
[32:32] where he'd do it for me if God ever
[32:34] promises you anything what are you
[32:35] worried about
[32:37] right you know if he promises and you
[32:40] really know it's a promise from God you
[32:42] know I'm like brother Ram you know when
[32:45] God told me that that that Wade was
[32:49] coming back to him and then when he told
[32:50] me later he'd be standing here in the
[32:51] pull pit with me I didn't care who knew
[32:54] it amen I would have told the whole
[32:56] world right I had to put it in a in a
[32:59] paper around the world cuz that doesn't
[33:00] bother me cuz I I believe it you know
[33:04] but now I want to just not back up into
[33:07] the message but like I'm telling you now
[33:09] listen please listen to me for one time
[33:13] listen
[33:14] carefully uh I'm not backing
[33:17] up we are going forward but it is time
[33:22] to realize
[33:24] realization of Who We Are and what we're
[33:27] doing here and to stand on those things
[33:31] and why would it not be that you know if
[33:33] we drop back and preach of the new birth
[33:35] why what would be the trouble we now
[33:37] know what the new birth is what would it
[33:39] be to drop back and preach this or drop
[33:41] back as we call no you you notice one
[33:44] thing brother brandham preached the
[33:48] message and he preached it because I've
[33:50] expressed this to you many many times he
[33:53] preached up until
[33:54] 62 and there was there a lot of messages
[33:57] back there that were wonderful message I
[33:59] mean all of them are but then in when
[34:02] the seals open unto him he said it
[34:04] become a brand new book right well I
[34:07] think it's about time that we stop
[34:08] quoting that
[34:10] quote that it's become a new book and to
[34:13] read the book amen and to read it with
[34:16] the language of the day and I don't mean
[34:18] the World Language I'm talking about the
[34:21] language of the
[34:23] Revelation and then that way we can can
[34:26] follow therein and and not have no
[34:29] trouble so uh keep that in mind as we go
[34:31] along down the
[34:33] message right because as I said now the
[34:36] head and body is to unite in the last
[34:38] days and if it's not the same material
[34:42] it cannot unite so if he's the word we
[34:45] must be the word all right well you know
[34:48] little church just word word word well
[34:50] what are
[34:52] you I got no
[34:54] problems what are you what do you claim
[34:56] to be well I'm great Revelation well uh
[35:01] come down let's talk about
[35:03] it might find out to like you got it in
[35:06] Revelation cuz that's none that's not
[35:09] you say well well I I just read between
[35:11] the lines well I've been over that and
[35:13] over
[35:14] that if what's between the lines is
[35:17] different than what's on the lines
[35:18] there's something wrong with you're
[35:21] reading now it's got to be the same it's
[35:23] got to be the same God well it's just
[35:25] deeper all right let's see it tie
[35:27] together right you can't start out with
[35:29] a a doctrine of of of one God and wind
[35:32] up with a doctrine of two Lords see then
[35:35] you claim it's a great Revelation
[35:37] written between the lines I'd have to
[35:38] agree it's written somewhere cuz it's
[35:40] not in the lines or on the lines but
[35:42] anyhow now let's go on so then the we
[35:47] was talking about how the headstone in
[35:49] Zechariah said it would be coming crying
[35:52] Grace
[35:53] Grace all right then how can we have any
[35:57] other message besides
[36:00] Grace you know how can we do it see now
[36:04] you say but brother Dale there's a lot
[36:06] of in the Bible about
[36:08] judgment but you better read real
[36:11] careful because judgment follows after
[36:15] the rejecting of the word right so then
[36:20] the rejecting of the word is what causes
[36:22] judgment to
[36:24] come all right now we're not talking
[36:27] about disgrace to just live like
[36:28] anything or whatever uh we're talking
[36:31] about true Grace is what we're going to
[36:33] talk about today I don't know may
[36:36] continue on a little bit on it but
[36:37] anyhow just put a title true true Grace
[36:40] because to me now there's only one
[36:42] message in this
[36:44] Bible right this Bible is the revealing
[36:48] of one true and living God right where
[36:51] he's at what he's doing and how that
[36:54] it's been the Believers in the book
[36:57] all the way down
[36:58] through that come out to make it a book
[37:01] to where that it can be done but what's
[37:03] it been it's been God revealing himself
[37:08] right manifesting himself all right then
[37:11] in that then there's only the the
[37:14] revealing of God through the word would
[37:17] be the message of true Grace right amen
[37:22] and that way we would understand what
[37:24] it's all about all right now
[37:28] said you say well I read a lot about
[37:30] judgment we just remember what you're
[37:32] reading is because you've turned down
[37:34] the word
[37:36] right you turn down the word you're
[37:38] judged right right you don't have to be
[37:40] judged later you're already judged all
[37:42] right now but if we'll read the Bible
[37:46] real
[37:47] carefully we'll
[37:49] see that when we
[37:51] reject God's word or anybody down
[37:54] through there's ever done it
[37:57] then that is what makes it change from
[38:02] grace to
[38:05] judgment all right now where do we get
[38:06] on right now here in just a minute and
[38:08] then we'll we'll get our Point all right
[38:09] so listen now let's just think about
[38:13] this and I want you to listen real
[38:15] carefully to what I'm saying and don't
[38:18] run off you know because I say something
[38:19] and run off and try to explain it to
[38:21] everybody sitting around you or whatever
[38:24] just listen to what I'm saying and and
[38:27] let's see what's going on
[38:30] now we we read the
[38:33] Bible and we talk about
[38:37] Grace and we say well we're saved by
[38:44] grace and then we turn around and we
[38:47] spend a lot of time explaining that
[38:49] Grace is unmar favor okay that's good
[38:54] cuz that's what it means it's
[38:57] if if it's anything besides unmar favor
[39:00] the word Grace would not be connected
[39:03] that's right but now here's what I want
[39:05] you to think
[39:07] about we say we're saved by
[39:12] grace you know that when Jesus Christ
[39:17] died every person in the world was saved
[39:21] that
[39:24] day I told you going to listen now cuz
[39:27] see you run your little computer brain
[39:29] up ahead and jump off and I can't help
[39:32] that listen to what said and we'll come
[39:35] back to TI it all together in a
[39:38] moment but you see we read in Romans
[39:42] were that he died once for all that's
[39:45] right now he didn't die one time for the
[39:48] bride and one time for the Jews and one
[39:52] time for the foolish virgin and one time
[39:55] for this group for
[39:58] whatever no he died one
[40:01] time H thank you Lord and see when he
[40:05] died he paid the price that's right
[40:08] right all right now that's why you hear
[40:11] the prophet
[40:13] saying he
[40:15] said people are not
[40:17] Sinners he said because we're under the
[40:20] bumper blood of the Lord Jesus
[40:23] Christ say there's nobody right now A
[40:27] Center into the face of God
[40:31] right
[40:33] because he paid the
[40:37] price
[40:40] now you say but now brother Dale you
[40:43] okay let's I like to walk on thin ice
[40:45] anyway because you
[40:47] know you generally find something there
[40:51] wonderful let me just read something
[40:53] your Prophet said wedding supper 1956
[40:55] 10:06
[40:57] the preparation has been appropriated
[40:59] for your
[41:01] salvation Christ died once and settled
[41:05] sin question
[41:06] forever you were saved the very hour
[41:10] that Christ
[41:11] died you were saved the very hour that
[41:14] Christ
[41:15] died okay now that Ain all he said every
[41:21] person that ever lived in the world from
[41:26] that time
[41:27] hence was saved at that
[41:32] time and ever healing that was ever
[41:35] performed the appropriation of the blood
[41:37] was shed at Calvary for every healing
[41:39] that would ever be taken place when
[41:41] Jesus died at Calvary it settled a
[41:44] question of sin and every attribute of
[41:47] sin now brother brandom you mean
[41:51] everybody's
[41:53] saved yeah
[41:57] right if you believe
[42:00] it you say yeah but now we know that you
[42:03] got to finish the rest of the story
[42:07] amen all right but get the story then we
[42:11] finish the rest of
[42:14] it cuz you see everybody is saved by
[42:18] grace right amen now there's no such
[42:21] thing as uh the bride being saved by
[42:25] grace the the foolish virgins saved by a
[42:28] different Grace or a different way or or
[42:31] the the Jews you
[42:34] know to be saved by another
[42:38] Grace there's only
[42:40] one one
[42:43] Grace so everybody in the world was
[42:45] saved what the day Jesus Christ died
[42:48] right amen what's the problem now can't
[42:52] believe the problem is is people won't
[42:56] accept it right that's right are you
[42:59] understanding what I'm trying to drive
[43:00] the point
[43:03] right see if you're not careful you're
[43:06] actually thinking that in some special
[43:08] way you want God to go back up on the
[43:11] cross and die again for you you know no
[43:15] he died once for all
[43:16] am all in the world are saved by
[43:20] grace now what do you think they're
[43:22] saved
[43:24] by now even the uh cup of water in my
[43:28] name see I like to cover that because I
[43:31] know how the human mind starts clicking
[43:33] when you say something it go you know
[43:35] over to fast forward on to another place
[43:38] and you don't hear what said for quite a
[43:41] while I did but no no you don't so you
[43:43] click over that's right
[43:47] see everybody in the world is
[43:50] saved if they'll accept it that's
[43:55] right so everybody saved by grace
[44:00] amen now but brother Dale you're telling
[44:04] me everybody in the world save yes it f
[44:07] accept it that's right
[44:10] amen if they W accept it now whose
[44:13] problem is
[44:18] it all right get the point driven down
[44:21] hard in your thinking and you'll
[44:23] understand why brother Brandon would
[44:24] make that statement that every person in
[44:28] the
[44:29] world was saved that day every person in
[44:33] the world was healed that day
[44:37] right cuz they were saved by
[44:40] grace nobody in the world
[44:44] deserved what happened at Calvary am
[44:48] right oh you goody goody you thank you
[44:51] doo oh I'm glad I didn't do what other
[44:54] people done
[44:58] if I have done what Brother Gary Atkins
[45:00] are doing God would have never saved
[45:05] me I'm glad I didn't do
[45:10] it now where is any Grace
[45:13] involved right if it's
[45:17] anything that you
[45:19] think of in any
[45:22] way that you would have to be able to
[45:25] present before God then why would Jesus
[45:28] Christ have to die at
[45:31] Calvary brother randam even the greatest
[45:34] he could think of when he was you
[45:36] remember when he was shot by the gun by
[45:37] his little buddy and and all and he was
[45:39] falling down and he was going towards
[45:41] hell and his vision or whatever it was
[45:43] you remember what he said said the only
[45:45] thing I can say Lord is I didn't commit
[45:47] adultery or something like
[45:49] that he had one thing he could say but
[45:51] you know that didn't save him see that's
[45:54] what people think we right in and God
[45:56] just turned it around and started him
[45:58] right back up the other way you
[46:00] know
[46:02] no just get one thing in your
[46:07] mind that no matter what Hebrew series
[46:11] the prophet of God said I'd hate to
[46:12] think that I was born five minutes ago
[46:16] and have to face God at death now what
[46:20] could a five minute old baby
[46:23] do he said I hate the that he said
[46:27] because I was born in sin shaped in
[46:29] iniquity and spoused my mother's wound
[46:31] of liar
[46:32] right I know and I don't throw off on
[46:35] you know how I love little babies but
[46:36] you look down at a little baby and you
[46:37] say ah beautiful little
[46:42] liar but you don't want people to want
[46:44] you to call her baby a liar but they
[46:47] will be don't you worry about it they
[46:49] they'll do it one of these days you just
[46:52] keep on for a little while but now get
[46:54] my point
[46:57] so we can take the
[47:00] Bible and the prophet's
[47:03] message and we can isolate
[47:06] things pick you know what we want and
[47:10] and we can make it say
[47:13] anything but get to Foundation now and
[47:16] then we'll move on into the point of
[47:18] what we're talking about on true
[47:20] Grace there's not a Grace for the Jews
[47:22] and a Grace for the bride and a Grace
[47:24] for the foolish virgin the grace for
[47:26] like I said the cup of water in my name
[47:28] just remember it was that's based upon
[47:33] the grace that there was somebody there
[47:36] that was a member of the bride of Christ
[47:39] that was standing there it's not just a
[47:41] couple of water given to every drunk on
[47:43] the street right you know so it's still
[47:46] Grace amen all right are you
[47:49] listening right see the prophet of God
[47:52] said true Grace straightened out
[47:56] he said not
[47:58] disgrace he said but true
[48:01] Grace to understand a real Revelation
[48:05] about
[48:07] Grace So then every
[48:11] person is saved by
[48:13] grace now what does that make you any
[48:15] different than anybody
[48:20] else
[48:22] see now we read where Paul said that we
[48:26] were like the others we were of the
[48:28] world we've done these things we were
[48:30] these things you know that's where uh
[48:32] the people of the message they seem to
[48:34] forget where they come from you know
[48:36] they're real good about saying I never
[48:39] did Sin the prophet
[48:42] said I was saved all the
[48:46] way
[48:47] well those things are
[48:50] true but if they're not placed in the
[48:52] correct order they're just like what I
[48:54] laid out before you MH I just laid out
[48:57] before you an outstanding statement
[48:59] didn't it that everybody in the
[49:02] world was saved when Jesus Christ
[49:06] died and every person that was you know
[49:09] would ever be healed or anything that
[49:11] was healed when Jesus Christ took the
[49:15] stripes now we know then that there's
[49:17] something wrong with the
[49:20] story if that's what we're holding
[49:22] to so then we just read
[49:26] basically what we want to
[49:29] read like brother Mo used to say you
[49:32] know uh the Bible said Thou shalt not
[49:36] steal and uh he'd say but the Bible
[49:40] don't say thou shal not steal
[49:46] chickens so it'd be okay to steal
[49:50] chickens but you'd have to find out what
[49:52] the word would follow that to know what
[49:54] you couldn't steal you
[49:58] right you'd be surprised what our
[50:00] thinking is a lot of times right let's
[50:02] go back and read our scripture again and
[50:03] get the correct answer from the
[50:05] scripture and not from our uh concept go
[50:08] back in
[50:11] uh
[50:18] Ephesians and let's get the right
[50:20] understanding you know what we're
[50:21] talking
[50:24] about the reading we'll go down about
[50:26] verse
[50:27] 5 even when we were dead in sins hath
[50:30] quickened us together with Christ by
[50:33] Grace you're
[50:35] saved all
[50:39] right so then everybody in the world is
[50:48] saved and has raised us up together and
[50:51] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[50:53] in Christ Jesus that in the Ages come he
[50:55] might show show the exceeding Riches of
[50:57] his grace in his kindness toward us
[50:59] through Christ Jesus now watching for by
[51:03] grace are you
[51:09] saved through
[51:14] faith and there's your key right said
[51:16] well we know that okay that's
[51:20] good so then everybody is saved by
[51:24] grace
[51:29] he paid the price for
[51:32] everybody why your Prophet would say the
[51:35] bumper blood's laying there and there's
[51:36] no sinner in the presence of God at this
[51:39] moment he said but when that blood is
[51:42] removed you don't want to be
[51:45] there but see now we're seeing that it
[51:48] says true
[51:51] Faith so by grace are you saved through
[51:56] Faith now the word true is a a word like
[51:59] something that you uh you go in a pip
[52:01] you come out through you know or
[52:03] something you go through or whatever
[52:06] life is and and everything
[52:10] but it's true
[52:13] faith in other words now you have
[52:15] something to do with
[52:19] it I know I'm making you think that's
[52:22] what I want you to do at least try
[52:24] anyway I can't play in everybody's
[52:26] brains but you know sometimes I have
[52:29] trouble playing in my own
[52:33] but you just say but Brother D I'm saved
[52:36] by
[52:38] grace that's not what the Bible says
[52:41] yeah it is it says right there above
[52:43] that I'm saved by
[52:45] grace everybody
[52:51] is
[52:54] okay H I didn't say these things you're
[52:57] prophets when taught it you claim to
[52:59] believe
[53:00] him but it notice the point is it says
[53:03] and by grace are you saved through
[53:08] faith now something is happening to
[53:13] you you have started a
[53:16] journey see by accepting Jesus Christ as
[53:19] your
[53:21] savior you have started a
[53:24] journey
[53:25] and that Journey will travel sometimes a
[53:28] short while or whatever it can be quick
[53:31] or it can be longer according to your
[53:37] faith but now to just say that I'm saved
[53:40] by
[53:42] faith now if you were on the level with
[53:45] me and we're talking that's all right
[53:48] but remember if you're just on the level
[53:51] of saying Saved By Faith then
[53:53] everybody's saved by faith
[53:57] but you see what I've done and what we
[54:00] must do as
[54:01] individuals we have taken what God has
[54:05] done and died for our
[54:08] sins all
[54:10] right died for our
[54:14] sins just like he died for
[54:18] everybody no brother Dale he only died
[54:21] for me well that's all right you must
[54:24] believe it only died for you because
[54:26] that's you got to be personal that's all
[54:29] right but now see then he gave everybody
[54:32] an
[54:33] opportunity right amen that's what I'm
[54:35] trying to get you to see he has given
[54:37] everybody in the world an opportunity to
[54:39] be saved right cuz he paid the
[54:44] price but because we will not accept
[54:47] what God has done for
[54:49] us then it doesn't go on to the stage of
[54:53] saying through faith
[54:56] through Revelation cuz you're saved by
[54:58] Revelation
[55:01] right it's got to be revealed to
[55:04] you so it's through
[55:07] faith
[55:09] now through
[55:12] faith God brings you and I through a
[55:16] journey of
[55:19] justification
[55:20] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[55:22] Ghost out through adoption ET
[55:25] coming all the way to the chain of the
[55:27] body he has made a way for us to travel
[55:30] that
[55:34] Journey but Brother D I thought it was
[55:36] all on him choosing
[55:40] well I thought we didn't believe that he
[55:42] chose one and rejected the other just
[55:44] because he liked one better than the
[55:45] other one that's right I thought
[55:47] something we had to do with it amen I
[55:50] thought the reason he could say Jacob
[55:51] have I loved and Esau have I hated was
[55:54] the fact that he what Jacob and Esau
[55:56] would
[55:57] do that was what I thought it's been
[55:59] based on if I've missed that I'm
[56:03] sorry but I believe that would tie
[56:05] together with predestination adoption
[56:07] Etc will tie together huh see but
[56:12] justification and sanctification and
[56:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a journey
[56:16] that you and I take take through
[56:20] faith or by faith if you want to use the
[56:23] word but I'm just saying it through
[56:24] faith because of what we're going to get
[56:26] down to in a
[56:27] minute you know that basically as
[56:31] recurred or spoken of now I said
[56:33] basically cuz I'll show you the
[56:35] others then in the Old Testament they
[56:37] were actually saved by
[56:43] faith but in the New Testament we're
[56:45] saved through
[56:50] faith he said
[56:53] well okay let's read a few
[56:57] scriptures look at
[56:59] Romans 3
[57:06] and3 let's just see if we can show that
[57:08] by the
[57:14] scripture verse 29 is he the god of the
[57:17] Jews only is not is he not also of the
[57:21] Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also see it
[57:24] is one God God which shall justify the
[57:28] circumcision by
[57:30] faith and the
[57:33] uncircumcision through faith right
[57:38] y
[57:40] now so that's why you find if you read R
[57:43] uh read Hebrews 11 we'll get to it if we
[57:47] have time in a minute you'll see
[57:48] basically that it'll say by faith
[57:51] Abraham offered unto God
[57:55] by faith so and so of the Old Testament
[57:58] but then when you get in closer to where
[58:00] we are it'll say through
[58:03] faith we understand the worlds were
[58:06] framed right see so get in mind what
[58:10] we're looking
[58:11] at look at Galatians
[58:18] 3:8 you like me I have a hard time
[58:20] finding some of this so I put a marker
[58:21] in mine right after second Cor Galatians
[58:32] 3:8 and the scripture foreseeing that
[58:35] God would justify the Heathen through
[58:39] faith preached before the gospel unto
[58:41] Abraham saying in thee shall All Nations
[58:44] be
[58:44] blessed justify the Heathen now we know
[58:47] who the Heathen are right that's us us
[58:51] you you know
[58:53] Gentiles now was the Heathen was the
[58:56] Gentiles but what I'm trying to do is to
[58:58] get you to look it through and let's go
[59:01] over there to Hebrews while we at we got
[59:02] to look
[59:04] down Hebrews
[59:10] 11 he lays down a great subject while
[59:13] you're getting there because he said now
[59:14] Faith is the substance of things hope
[59:16] for the evidence of Things Not Seen for
[59:19] by it the elders obtained a good report
[59:22] through faith we understand the the
[59:24] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[59:26] that things which are seen were not were
[59:29] not made of things which do appear now
[59:31] watch by faith Abel offered unto God see
[59:34] True by True by True by remember what
[59:38] I'm
[59:40] saying there's not a difference in
[59:42] Salvation it's all by
[59:44] Grace but it's showing you that one of
[59:47] them was looking forward to it and the
[59:49] other is looking back for to it because
[59:52] we're going through the Journey that's
[59:54] why we're through faith we're going
[59:55] through a journey they were looking
[59:58] forward to something see by faith able
[1:00:01] offer under God a more excellent
[1:00:02] sacrifice and Cain that what you obtain
[1:00:04] witness that he was righteous God
[1:00:06] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:00:09] being dead yet speak by faith Enoch was
[1:00:11] translated that he should not see death
[1:00:13] and was not found because God had
[1:00:15] translated him for before his
[1:00:17] translation he had this testimony that
[1:00:19] he pleased God but without faith it is
[1:00:21] impossible to please
[1:00:23] him now
[1:00:25] then without a
[1:00:28] revelation
[1:00:32] Faith it's impossible to pleas God
[1:00:34] because you must believe that he
[1:00:38] is by faith Noah verse 7 by faith
[1:00:42] Abraham verse
[1:00:44] 8 talking verse n of how he
[1:00:47] sojourned but now look when it comes to
[1:00:50] Sarah which would be a type of the Bride
[1:00:53] right look what what it says in verse 11
[1:00:55] through faith also sah herself received
[1:00:58] seed see I wrote in my Bible a long time
[1:01:00] ago I said look at there that represents
[1:01:02] the
[1:01:02] bride cuz she did have something to do
[1:01:05] with going through right but you see
[1:01:07] it's not always it's that it's showing
[1:01:09] you the point of what I want you to
[1:01:11] see right that we think we're just what
[1:01:15] we're just saved by
[1:01:18] grace well everybody
[1:01:23] is
[1:01:25] but you see everybody we know is not
[1:01:26] going to be saved right we know that
[1:01:30] right everybody's not going to be saved
[1:01:33] but anybody that's ever saved is saved
[1:01:35] by grace God's unmar favor to come down
[1:01:40] and die for all of
[1:01:43] us but see we
[1:01:46] then we then as
[1:01:51] Believers accepting the fact that he he
[1:01:54] died in our place then we start that
[1:01:57] journey through
[1:01:59] faith and we travel a journey through
[1:02:02] the Christian
[1:02:04] journey and coming down to the
[1:02:08] basis that we can understand real
[1:02:12] Grace because now here's my point so
[1:02:15] listen you can't
[1:02:18] take the Journey of a
[1:02:20] Christian now I said the Journey of a
[1:02:23] Christian justification
[1:02:24] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:02:26] Ghost you know adoption Etc you can't
[1:02:30] take that and turn out with disgrace
[1:02:34] right now you tell me you can I'll tell
[1:02:37] you there something wrong with you
[1:02:40] mentally it's not right right because if
[1:02:44] it's true
[1:02:47] Faith it's something you have went
[1:02:49] through
[1:02:50] with and see then you you know I've
[1:02:53] always told you the way I check a
[1:02:55] doctrine of somebody preaching I'm not
[1:02:58] sitting there saying oh he missed that
[1:02:59] quote he missed that one well you can do
[1:03:01] that easy right well he didn't quote all
[1:03:04] the words that was in that
[1:03:06] quote
[1:03:08] no brother Mo us and myself years ago we
[1:03:11] used to go around we'd find out that
[1:03:13] that everybody was saying brother so and
[1:03:14] so was off the message well that was the
[1:03:16] guy we wanted to hear because there's
[1:03:18] one thing about it he was stirring up
[1:03:19] more ground than the others were so we'd
[1:03:21] want to go hear him but I never check
[1:03:23] anybody
[1:03:25] what I check people
[1:03:28] by my new
[1:03:31] birth now you tell me what you check it
[1:03:34] by I'll check it by the prophet's
[1:03:37] message if you ain't got the new
[1:03:40] birth what have you
[1:03:42] got quotes it'll argue with
[1:03:46] quotes and you'll never come out to the
[1:03:48] correct
[1:03:52] understanding see what real Grace is yes
[1:03:55] but see it's true
[1:04:00] Faith now Romans 2 and 4 says that it's
[1:04:06] the goodness of
[1:04:08] God that
[1:04:10] leadth us to
[1:04:13] repentance all right so now the goodness
[1:04:16] of God is Grace so would there be any
[1:04:19] problem me saying there the grace of God
[1:04:21] leadth me to
[1:04:23] repentance
[1:04:25] but you see the born again Christian
[1:04:28] travels through a
[1:04:30] journey whereas other people are only
[1:04:33] making it so far through the Journey up
[1:04:35] and down or whatever and just saying
[1:04:37] well bless God I'm saved by grace so it
[1:04:39] don't matter what I do I'll be all right
[1:04:41] I'll be
[1:04:43] there cuz I'm predestinated now that's
[1:04:46] the quote of the people of the message
[1:04:48] that's right I'll be there cuz I'm
[1:04:51] predestinated well all right now now
[1:04:54] we'll go another
[1:04:56] round everybody in the world is
[1:05:01] predestinated you
[1:05:04] agree everybody's saved by grace you
[1:05:07] agree everybody's predestinated you
[1:05:12] agree everybody's going
[1:05:17] somewhere right would you agree now you
[1:05:23] agree they give you another
[1:05:25] one people lay heavily as I said the
[1:05:28] prophets not here where to change these
[1:05:30] things but you remember when he went
[1:05:32] beyond the curtain of time and he came
[1:05:34] back and I can find it but I just didn't
[1:05:36] even think about using it but he said I
[1:05:40] saw every one of you
[1:05:43] there well I've heard people say you
[1:05:45] know he saw me
[1:05:49] there but you better remember one thing
[1:05:52] come on he went to hell and he went to
[1:05:54] heaven right so he saw all of us
[1:06:00] somewhere
[1:06:02] right now that ain't the way it is
[1:06:04] brother D he saw me in heaven
[1:06:07] well if we don't make the
[1:06:11] journey right right if we don't make the
[1:06:14] journey through faith where is our
[1:06:16] judgment set far right we have turned
[1:06:19] down the grace of God that's right
[1:06:23] brother
[1:06:24] so then when the prophet said it's not
[1:06:27] what I
[1:06:33] do it's what he
[1:06:37] done
[1:06:39] what all
[1:06:41] right now if we don't understand that
[1:06:44] correctly then I apply it the same
[1:06:47] way it's not what anybody in the world
[1:06:50] done it's what God
[1:06:53] done
[1:06:58] right see grace sure that's unmar favor
[1:07:02] thank
[1:07:04] God but if I take that and I use it in
[1:07:08] the wrong way then I make it disgrace
[1:07:11] and that's not unmerited
[1:07:13] favor if I say it doesn't matter what I
[1:07:17] do I'm saved you brother brand said that
[1:07:21] yeah check what he's talking about
[1:07:24] that's right he never said check it and
[1:07:26] find it if you can he never said I go
[1:07:29] out and drink all I want to run around
[1:07:30] do whatever no what did he
[1:07:33] say but you see people use it that
[1:07:36] they'll just quote it to people over the
[1:07:37] pull pit and you know brother R
[1:07:40] said it's not what I do what he's
[1:07:43] already done well I
[1:07:45] Amen to see that don't make no
[1:07:47] difference what I do I can drink get no
[1:07:50] no no no no the one thing brother renam
[1:07:53] said
[1:07:54] about that it didn't matter what he done
[1:07:57] you'll check it he's talking
[1:08:00] about I don't have to preach to be
[1:08:04] saved that's right he said I'm saved
[1:08:07] anyway uhhuh he said if I go out and sit
[1:08:10] down and Don't Preach no more said it
[1:08:12] has nothing to do with my salvation now
[1:08:15] you find me where he said I can go out
[1:08:17] and drink gamble run around with women
[1:08:19] all Etc and still say that he's
[1:08:22] okay
[1:08:27] oh that changes the story doesn't
[1:08:31] it I'm sorry have I become your enemy
[1:08:34] because
[1:08:35] I studied the message and can tell the
[1:08:39] truth at least to what I want you know
[1:08:43] whatever but see
[1:08:46] grace is what brings us to God right now
[1:08:50] I'm looking at some of these quotes and
[1:08:51] so but that's off the message here you
[1:08:53] he 1956 12 uh 15 Grace is what brings us
[1:08:58] to God God Saves Us by grace and no man
[1:09:03] never sought God at any time the Bible
[1:09:05] said see we say I sought God I don't no
[1:09:08] didn't is God seeking
[1:09:11] you than Lord there's your journey of
[1:09:16] through just not just I just live like
[1:09:19] the devil I I can do anything and I'm
[1:09:22] still going to heaven now show me that
[1:09:23] in the prophet's message or the
[1:09:28] Bible see because you remember what I'm
[1:09:30] saying I didn't
[1:09:33] say I did not
[1:09:36] say that you're
[1:09:38] perfect and won't never do
[1:09:41] nothing but you show me where the Bible
[1:09:43] ever justifies what's
[1:09:46] done what is done has to be
[1:09:49] condemned whether it be Old Testament or
[1:09:52] new testament right
[1:09:55] right
[1:09:57] okay what happened to David and Bash
[1:10:00] Sheba
[1:10:01] yeah well look at that boy made it out
[1:10:04] now he said you'll pay
[1:10:07] y you'll
[1:10:09] pay always
[1:10:12] did he had a dead
[1:10:16] child but you see what I'm talking about
[1:10:19] yes see we talk about Grace Oh Brother D
[1:10:22] Grace is unmerited favor it don't matter
[1:10:24] what I
[1:10:26] do now show me that in the Bible in the
[1:10:30] point of saying that it doesn't matter
[1:10:32] what you do cuz remember how I preach a
[1:10:35] little different than maybe most people
[1:10:37] preach about salvation and things and
[1:10:39] but I preach it the way I believe it
[1:10:41] right I believe Mark
[1:10:43] 11 if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:10:47] but I believe it's based on about two
[1:10:49] verses below
[1:10:52] there
[1:10:55] then it says if you won't forgive you
[1:10:58] won't be
[1:10:59] forgiven all
[1:11:02] right well that's putting it on
[1:11:04] something you do or don't do no no no
[1:11:06] it's
[1:11:07] not don't worry about you're already
[1:11:09] done to done you done that
[1:11:11] anyway it's trying to get it
[1:11:15] straight but you
[1:11:17] see brother says Grace is what God did
[1:11:21] for me works is what I do for of
[1:11:26] God now watch him and they'll make a
[1:11:29] Doctrine out of it they think that works
[1:11:33] is what wins your
[1:11:37] merits if it
[1:11:40] is it isn't a free
[1:11:46] gift Grace is what God did for you by
[1:11:51] Grace you're saved and and works is what
[1:11:54] you do in appreciation of the grace that
[1:11:56] he showed to you
[1:11:59] amen cuz you see I know that we're saved
[1:12:02] by
[1:12:04] grace I know that and you don't do
[1:12:07] anything to get saved except except
[1:12:10] except the fact that you accept Jesus
[1:12:12] Christ
[1:12:14] right but now after you're
[1:12:19] saved our life is totally on conditions
[1:12:25] you said no no no no no you putting it's
[1:12:28] own conditions I saw a sign I've Pine gr
[1:12:32] I think it GS that says uh old age is
[1:12:36] what is what is the word in inable in
[1:12:38] other words it means it's going to come
[1:12:40] old age is going to come
[1:12:42] inev but said growth
[1:12:46] development you got something to do with
[1:12:48] it you got something to do with growth
[1:12:51] development all right but now think
[1:12:54] about what I'm
[1:12:55] saying brother random said
[1:12:58] on invisible Union the Bride of Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ 1965 11:27 that the Bride of
[1:13:04] Jesus Christ is wearing a b wedding
[1:13:06] bound of Grace B Band of Grace unmar of
[1:13:11] your own God did it himself he knew you
[1:13:15] before the foundation of the world so he
[1:13:17] slip the wedding band on you there put
[1:13:19] your name on the book what a
[1:13:21] Thanksgiving
[1:13:22] Hallelujah
[1:13:24] you see once you're born
[1:13:28] again your life then is on a conditional
[1:13:33] form because growth development has to
[1:13:35] do with
[1:13:38] life if we don't study God's word are we
[1:13:41] going to grow in it
[1:13:44] no you know if we don't read pray and
[1:13:46] study are we're going to grow in it i'
[1:13:49] be like telling child you don't need to
[1:13:52] eat you don't need to eat you're a
[1:13:56] child I don't think any of us have much
[1:13:59] problems with
[1:14:01] that we spend too much time
[1:14:05] eating but now think with me for a
[1:14:07] minute cuz I'm just trying to get to
[1:14:09] this point and we'll bring it to a
[1:14:14] close nothing we could
[1:14:17] do to Merit our
[1:14:21] Salvation am I back where started
[1:14:24] you're saved by grace nothing you could
[1:14:27] do to Merit
[1:14:32] that but when you get born
[1:14:37] again the growth development is
[1:14:39] dependent upon whether or not we'll eat
[1:14:41] God's word
[1:14:43] amen and if we don't eat his word then
[1:14:46] whose problem is it well like my brother
[1:14:49] said well it don't matter to me Sam I
[1:14:51] just want to go to heaven
[1:14:54] good point but see that's a good old
[1:14:56] Baptist way of seeing it you I just want
[1:14:59] to go to
[1:15:00] heaven well I told you a long time ago I
[1:15:03] quit trying to go to
[1:15:05] heaven I believe Heaven's coming
[1:15:09] here and see if we're not in that
[1:15:12] channel in that word to where God can
[1:15:14] come down and reveal himself to us we if
[1:15:17] we don't study he can't reveal it
[1:15:22] right and and then if we even take it as
[1:15:25] studying after somebody that has taught
[1:15:27] us wrong how can God reveal that to us
[1:15:30] that's
[1:15:31] right right
[1:15:33] right I mean we're taught wrong God
[1:15:36] can't reveal wrong word that's right
[1:15:39] amen well he'll just come down when he
[1:15:41] wants to and straighten me
[1:15:43] out no might not
[1:15:46] be we got a lot to do with it right amen
[1:15:49] I know I sound funny you say well well
[1:15:51] brother Dale you sound like you're
[1:15:52] saying that that salvation is totally of
[1:15:55] God but then you turn around and sound
[1:15:56] like you're saying that we got something
[1:15:57] to do with it I told you how many times
[1:16:00] already I told you after you're born
[1:16:04] again after you're born again you do
[1:16:07] have something to do with your growth
[1:16:08] development right right amen cuz that
[1:16:11] way you're in a journey traveling
[1:16:14] through
[1:16:15] faith and the Bible says that what the
[1:16:18] faith to
[1:16:19] Faith from Revelation to revelation
[1:16:26] meaning that we're in a
[1:16:29] journey so you're Save By Grace
[1:16:33] what through faith
[1:16:36] right through the Journey you
[1:16:40] travel you know sometimes it's not too
[1:16:42] good of a
[1:16:44] journey I mean it' be nice if every day
[1:16:46] that if go God would come down like he
[1:16:49] did in the cool of of the evening in the
[1:16:50] garden and talk to Adam and Eve be nice
[1:16:53] to just talk to God every day you I I
[1:16:57] don't get that opportunity and I know
[1:16:58] it's my
[1:17:00] problem and I don't mean I don't pray I
[1:17:03] just mean that it's my problem sometimes
[1:17:05] that God can't talk to
[1:17:10] me cuz you see I get my mind on
[1:17:13] something else in some other form it's
[1:17:15] hard for him to do
[1:17:18] it we have to live in life and that's
[1:17:20] fine we we live and we work we do
[1:17:23] you
[1:17:25] know but are you understanding what I'm
[1:17:27] saying we're in a journey
[1:17:30] folks the Christian journey is a
[1:17:33] traveling through faith
[1:17:37] amen so everybody saved by by
[1:17:41] Grace but we're saved by grace through
[1:17:45] faith
[1:17:48] yes and we got in a
[1:17:51] journey and we're responding responsible
[1:17:53] in that
[1:17:56] journey I mean we go out and we do
[1:17:59] something wrong the prophet of God said
[1:18:02] what he said you sent us in as a
[1:18:04] Christian what did he say he said you're
[1:18:06] going to reap a tub fo that's
[1:18:10] right
[1:18:11] right well I'm
[1:18:14] saved well go argue with him about the
[1:18:16] tub being dumped on
[1:18:20] you just remember the TB being D on you
[1:18:23] because you needed it dumped that's what
[1:18:25] to say it right we don't want it turned
[1:18:28] over the
[1:18:30] tub you see I'm just trying to get you
[1:18:32] to see true Grace
[1:18:37] am now why wouldn't
[1:18:40] we you know why wouldn't we want to
[1:18:46] be to where that when we talk to God and
[1:18:49] all to not try and I was listening we
[1:18:51] was last night cuz I I've been studying
[1:18:53] on this for a little bit and uh we're
[1:18:56] listening to the message of Grace and
[1:18:57] I'd invite you to to listen to that one
[1:19:00] and to read the adoption series that
[1:19:02] would be good because you
[1:19:09] know in all of that your Prophet is
[1:19:12] explaining real true
[1:19:15] Grace you
[1:19:17] know and he says there's not a thing you
[1:19:20] can do to Merit what God does that's
[1:19:24] right there's no such thing as trying to
[1:19:26] get on the good side with God there's no
[1:19:30] brownie points right you
[1:19:33] know there's no try to do good
[1:19:37] right
[1:19:39] no but just automatically be what you
[1:19:42] are
[1:19:48] right I mean I worked at General Motors
[1:19:50] I had a job and these brothers knowed it
[1:19:53] was you know was all on assembly lines
[1:19:55] and yeah I had an opportunity cuz I was
[1:19:57] the oldest ranking in the the uh pool
[1:20:01] and I could pretty well pick my job but
[1:20:04] instead of that I would take some of the
[1:20:05] hard jobs and run them that day let
[1:20:08] somebody
[1:20:09] else I've actually went up to people and
[1:20:11] just told them said just go take a break
[1:20:12] and get gone for a
[1:20:14] while I'll run your job Lord come back
[1:20:17] in an hour or
[1:20:20] so why because it's just me
[1:20:23] mhm I mean that's just the way I am I've
[1:20:27] never thought that because of me being
[1:20:30] what I am is supposed to make me
[1:20:32] something
[1:20:34] special I am something
[1:20:37] special he made me
[1:20:40] that and I try to live the life of
[1:20:43] Christ always did it work or whether it
[1:20:45] be anywhere where us hunting whatever
[1:20:47] we're doing it's always
[1:20:50] this the same life right amen
[1:20:54] yeah why wouldn't it
[1:20:57] be why would I want to be something here
[1:20:59] that's what they always said it work
[1:21:01] said we don't understand how a preacher
[1:21:02] can Pastor can work with his
[1:21:04] congregation CU about seven of us work
[1:21:06] together there every day you know well
[1:21:08] that didn't bother me I should ask them
[1:21:10] am I any different when I'm up in the
[1:21:11] pool pit than I am here living every day
[1:21:14] with
[1:21:17] you but you understand what I'm talking
[1:21:20] about if you're a Christian you don't
[1:21:23] have to make yourself do
[1:21:26] things it's a pleasure
[1:21:30] to well I just when people tell me I
[1:21:32] just I just get my righteous indignation
[1:21:35] right I just I just want to
[1:21:37] release well go out as brother Tom used
[1:21:40] to say I wish he here today need all
[1:21:42] amen well brother Tom me and him would
[1:21:45] get on to something you know and he
[1:21:46] didn't didn't maybe like it or didn't
[1:21:48] figure it out real good and and uh he'd
[1:21:51] be gone for a day or two cuz every day
[1:21:53] he'd bring me my breakfast he'd always
[1:21:55] be there work with me day in and day out
[1:21:57] right on the line you know I mean just
[1:21:58] come right by every day I got a big old
[1:22:00] slab of biscuit I mean a big Texas toast
[1:22:04] sandwich you know with couple of three
[1:22:06] or four eggs and and big old strink of
[1:22:09] lean all on the and a cup of coffee but
[1:22:12] when it get kind of down something get
[1:22:14] tied on him brother Tom would disappear
[1:22:16] for a
[1:22:17] while well when he come back I'd say Tom
[1:22:21] where you been
[1:22:25] I've been out y there butting my head

[1:23:18] problem being a
[1:23:20] Christian no I enjy enjoy it
[1:23:24] amen I enjoy being a
[1:23:27] Christian do you have your bad days yeah
[1:23:31] but I ain't going to let you know
[1:23:34] it
[1:23:35] right well I said yesterday said when
[1:23:38] you're out here running over there and
[1:23:39] waited went to the deer hunting land she
[1:23:41] said you're wore out I no I'm not and I
[1:23:46] wasn't but you know what I can do I I'm
[1:23:49] in bad sh I'm in bad sh everything going
[1:23:53] wrong well you know what I won't be long
[1:23:54] I'll be in bad shape
[1:23:57] that's but instead of that I'm
[1:23:59] happy I'm happy to be a Christian I'm
[1:24:03] happy to be what I
[1:24:05] am and that's all I want to do is just
[1:24:07] be a
[1:24:09] Christian saved by grace through
[1:24:13] faith I'm in a journey and I'm traveling
[1:24:16] through that
[1:24:18] faith and I realize that there's nothing
[1:24:20] I can do to Merit it I did didn't Merit
[1:24:23] him calling me but you know what he's
[1:24:26] called a lot of people is that scripture
[1:24:29] many are
[1:24:30] called but few are chosen well now you
[1:24:33] know what that mean that that means that
[1:24:35] brother collie he looks good you know
[1:24:37] but brother dick he don't look too good
[1:24:38] so I choose him because I like the good
[1:24:39] and he he gave me a little poke little
[1:24:41] money in there you
[1:24:43] know yeah no that's not what it means
[1:24:47] folks that's
[1:24:50] right that's not the way it is
[1:24:53] that's right he doesn't choose by what
[1:24:56] he
[1:24:57] likes no he chooses by his for
[1:25:02] knowledge to know what you'll
[1:25:05] do we're not going to pull anything over
[1:25:08] on
[1:25:10] him but do you understand what I'm
[1:25:11] saying I'll try to
[1:25:13] quit that you said we're saved by
[1:25:18] grace but put the rest up with it
[1:25:23] cuz everybody's saved by
[1:25:25] grace but you accept it and it becomes
[1:25:28] true Faith instead of
[1:25:31] by that's good instead of just being
[1:25:34] something you're living yourself it
[1:25:36] becomes a journey of life but you have a
[1:25:39] wonderful thing I don't understand it I
[1:25:41] can't I can't
[1:25:44] comprehend when I was in the Baptist we
[1:25:47] went to church I can't comprehend that's
[1:25:49] one thing I don't understand is how
[1:25:51] people can miss church I don't
[1:25:54] understand that I I can't understand
[1:25:57] it because it's never been with my wife
[1:25:59] and I you know are we going to church
[1:26:05] Sunday I've never done that in the
[1:26:09] Baptist well so and so said is coming
[1:26:12] tell them not to come on
[1:26:14] Sunday that's
[1:26:18] right but you know you going to hurt
[1:26:20] feelings brother Dale well who going to
[1:26:22] hurt you are
[1:26:24] God right amen amen
[1:26:27] amen that's
[1:26:29] right but you say well that's the only
[1:26:31] time we get to see them well that's all
[1:26:33] right then that's the only time I ever
[1:26:34] get to see my family is I got to lay out
[1:26:36] a church to see them that I won't see
[1:26:38] them that's right they're the one making
[1:26:40] the choice not
[1:26:42] me especially if they're in this
[1:26:50] message then now you're Ming okay okay
[1:26:52] I'll quit
[1:26:54] meddling but by grace are you saved
[1:26:58] through faith that's
[1:27:02] right there's no problem with everybody
[1:27:05] that's in the same journey is it you
[1:27:07] know the trouble they had with the
[1:27:08] people in the Bible was
[1:27:09] who children of Israel had them you know
[1:27:12] what it says about it mixed
[1:27:15] multitude mixed multitudes when it got
[1:27:17] them always messed
[1:27:18] up he said what's a mixed multitude
[1:27:21] mixed multitude is just exactly what it
[1:27:23] is a multitude is mixed
[1:27:26] up that's not following the truth that's
[1:27:32] right but where are
[1:27:36] we are we just saved by grace or is it
[1:27:41] by grace through
[1:27:45] faith if it is then it's a wonderful
[1:27:47] Journey amen come on brother a wonderful
[1:27:51] Journey
[1:27:54] to be able to be a
[1:27:58] Christian to be a
[1:28:03] Christian the little arm bands they have
[1:28:05] you know what would Jesus
[1:28:09] do what would he do in this
[1:28:14] day a journey he was in a
[1:28:18] journey he just didn't live by faith he
[1:28:21] lived through faith this
[1:28:23] thing he was in a journey we're in a
[1:28:29] journey It's a Wonderful
[1:28:31] opportunity to be in a
[1:28:33] journey to follow through into that

[1:28:42] Grace well it just don't make no
[1:28:44] difference what I do I'll be saved
[1:28:46] anyway now if you got that idea you're
[1:28:48] lost I don't mind saying
[1:28:51] that I find where the Prophet set it for
