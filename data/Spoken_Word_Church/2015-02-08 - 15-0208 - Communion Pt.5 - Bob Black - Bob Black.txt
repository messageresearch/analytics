TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah you know what that story is really a story of desperation because you got a story of of Nebuchadnezzar who's desperate to I got to find a way to for somebody to show me this dream he was like if y'all don't show me this dream I'm going to I'm going to kill you and and then on the other side Daniel is also desperate he goes to pray and God show us this dream and when you get desperate is really when something happens for everybody on on the recording we just read Daniel chapter 2 and last week we read Jeremiah chter 50 which talks about um how Bale and merid are confounded U can everybody see this because we're going to go like lightning again through a lot of quotes and and you might be wondering you know we were talking on communion this is the the fifth Sunday school lesson on communion you might be wondering what does this stone that came out of the mountain have to do with communion you remember what communion is is God trying to bring us into a position where he can fellowship with us you know when you when you when you have a child you know you uh in the natural you you kind of you can you can fellowship with them but it's it's on a different level when they begin to grow up when when they become to an adulthood you can look at them eye to eye and and you begin to talk about things like taxes and and uh things of of life just in the natural that that you they can they can begin to understand things that they wouldn't have even begun to know anything about when they were a little child when all they were concerned about was Legos and things but as they grow up they begin to you can talk to them eye to ey and that's that's that's what God is doing to us he's he's bringing us up to a position where where we're in communion with him and and uh we can we have an understanding of what's going on and really that that's why it's such a blessing to live in in this day because in this day a prophet came to set everything in order so that we could take a body change so we could have we could have a total understanding of all the all the Mysteries that were hidden in and there's a quote where brother said in that mountain are now revealed and what he came to do was was take all these little hidden pieces that down through the seven Church Ages were were uh Kush and Nimrod and that whole system uh cloaked the eyes of the people so they couldn't understand what God is really trying to do but now in this this day God sent a prophet so God could so Christ can come back and cap your personal life and bring you to a place where you can take a body change amen because you're you're you're totally believ in God's word you're you're I I do the the will of the father you know so that's why uh all all these scriptures just just uh everything just runs together in just a beautiful story you got back back in in uh when they were building that Tower of Babel you got kush and Nimrod trying to set up this separate system that that uh to confound to take God's word and and and make it something where uh you're you're taking people out of communion with God so what they did when they remember that little picture we showed of nimrod setting up the um the Tower of Babel and and there he was down there with people falling at his feet and see even the never canand that's the first thing he did was he saw God manifested in in in flesh with with Daniel and first thing he goes I'm going to bow at his at his feet right cuz they communion is between man it's an individual relationship between you and God when you put somebody else in between there like Nebuchadnezzar was trying to do with Daniel and and Kush and and Nimrod were trying to do they're setting up this thing where it takes you out of communion it takes you out of the only way you'll know God is through his word and if somebody else is in the mix it it uh see where we're going declare you in Jeremiah 50 verse2 it says declare you among the Nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say Babylon is taken baale a confounder is confounded mereda the rebel is broken in pieces her Idols are confounded her images are broken in pieces broken in pieces by what by that stone that came out of the mountain so that's what we're going to look at so let's kind of review real quickly brother R said real communion is taking the word of God we believe it with all our heart we see it manifested we see it given to us we see it Vindicated we feel it in our lives that's right that's why the life is the evidence you receive the word is it's not just saying I I agree but let let's see that life be made manifest amen the word coming into the believer his spiritual body is built up communion what we need is inoculation by the word of God now build up get ready for the inoculation and now what does his word do it builds up our spiritual body strong as we commune with him to resist the devil I'm just kind of quickly reviewing some of the things we read last time uh uh no matter how much theology you've got it's laying there dead I could have it see that's that's what those those the calans said they they they had a theological understanding of God and they failed to realize that God was was his his purpose was to come down and dwell with man that's why they that scripture one of the scriptures I just read in chap we just read in verse in chapter 2 was that they didn't understand that God was was was you know let me TR let me see if I can find that real quick ah here it is and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can show up before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh now Daniel God had come down to speak through Daniel in flesh and show them this Revelation they they failed to have an understanding that God well his his plan and purpose was to come down and reveal himself in the flesh which is what he did in Christ and what he's doing now in his bride is revealing himself in flesh and you can't understand that just by theology when the spirit comes and quickens that word it makes it alive just let's get through some of these there's only been one man ever lived on Earth that was our example and that was the one that died for us all our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ which is the stone and God blessed Noah and chapter nine God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful uh and multiply and replenish the Earth which is exactly what K Kush they they they want everybody to stay in one place make a little system uh Genesis 10:8 and Kush be n he began to be a mighty one in the earth and as he began to be Mighty he he he grew and and he started off in in Babel when he began became strong he he left out of there and begin to build other other countries and other uh built Nineveh and City rhab and K everything started at bab there's getting everybody to bow down before him getting everybody out of communion with God setting up a tower to to to reach all the way to heaven based on knowledge and a theological understanding of the word not being quickened by the spirit to separate us and and see the word confound means to mingle so it it it just you can run that all the way down from Genesis to Revelations that the devil is trying to take God's word and mingle it with with something something else you know mingle it with uh false interpretation add one word to it and so forth so he took us out of communion Genesis 11 the whole earth was of one language and of one speech as and as much Community as you can and they said go and let us build a city and a tower whose top May reach under heaven and let us make a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth and there's the three things that Nimrod wanted to do he wanted to set up a city in a tower set up a kingdom he wanted who's taught May reach under Heaven he wanted to set up a a religion and let us make a name L we be scattered a PR upon the face of the whole earth and then what did God do took them right back to his original plan and purpose and and uh go into all the world and preach the gospel so the Lord scattered them abroad from then upon the face of all the Earth therefore the name is the name of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and from then did the Lord scatter and brought upon the face of the Earth sir now it looks like like uh almost like God just says all of a sudden I'm I'm going to scatter everybody but really now go back to the if you trace the meanings of all these the the names of the people Kush and Nimrod everything Kush was known by baale which means the confounder he by mingling false Doctrine false teachings with the pure word of God he started this whole this whole mess he's really the one that uh that caused the dispersement to happen and here's some quotes from Alexander H's two BL ons the existence of a soul and omnipotent deity who created all things seems to have been the universal belief and tradition taught men the same Notions on this subject which in later times have been adopted by all civil civilized Nations the gothic religion taught the being of a supreme god God master of the universe so he just saying that in the beginning everybody you know believed in one God um were they were in as much communion as they could and then Along Came kissing Deon to to take them out of communion uh some quotes from the church Ages nus was the most nus being Nimrod was the most ancient of Assyrian Kings mentioned in history being of warlike disposition he trained many young men rigorously in the ARs of War he brought Babylonia under him while yet there was no city of Babylon the Babylonian religion was the first to drift away from the faith that at one time all the peoples of the earth believed in one God Supreme Eternal invisible who by the word of his mouth spoke all things into existence and that in his character he was loving and good and just a war like this you can trace that all the way down where when you try to force somebody to believe uh that that's the wrong attitude I don't know if you've ever heard of sun Su but he was this asan General that he had this saying that if you can understand your enemy and understand yourself then you can win a 100 Battles so you know you can look at at the traits of these people in in Genesis and just run it all the way down the trait of that that that Pagan system and kind of understand when when you begin to understand what the devil's doing and what God's doing then it it gives you it kind of gives you power to to um to conquer to overcome so baale Kush the confounder remember in Jeremiah chapter 50 it says baale will be confounded so he was the confounder he was the one that stirred everything but this stone that came out of the mountain is going to destroy everything that he set up so the confounder becomes confounded a't that beautiful that God just turns it around it is seen from this that bbell or chush the father of nimrod originally was the ring leader that led the people away from the true God and encouraged the the people as The Interpreter of gods to take another form of religion he encouraged them to go ahead with the tower which his son actually built this encouragement is what brought the confusion and the division of men so that he was both interpreter and confuser now that's from the per Church age the church age book Kush was known the Pagan Antiquity under the very character of B A confounder the god of confusion and look at the symbol of Janice whom the Ancients called chaos and and Janice and Chaos had the symbol of club that like break into is take God's word and the people and just just scatter it you know destroy it that symbol is a club and the name of a club and CI comes from the very word which signifies to break in pieces or scatter abroad he who caused the confusion of tongues was he who broke the previously United Earth in pieces and Scattered the fragments abroad is what Alexander hop say BR to yes sir sorry just wanted to add this in real quick cuz I just came to realization in the street their street slang especially amongst rappers and stuff like that they call marijuana Kush oh really and uh and uh it's kind of interesting I just now thinking about that yeah the confounder yeah so the priest of Rome set up the so interpreter of description uh interpreted of scripture and they you know one of the things they did was preserve and teaching the great truths of religion they want to keep it keep it secret instead of you know Jesus said I just I declared it openly I told you everything in the streets but they couldn't understand it everything was was just told you know brother Brown's openly preached all the seals he's openly declared all the the Daniel 70 weeks and everything it wasn't it wasn't hidden and a Babylonian Pagan symbol of God is the equilateral triangle which is so close to the true symbol which is that pyramid the Mountain of God God out of that mountain came a stone That Grew into a great Mountain see what it's doing in your lives out of that mountain came a stone that that he's the Cornerstone and The Headstone and your own life that Cornerstone grows into a mountain until it consumes all of your Earth that's the same thing he's going to do when he comes back when that that mountain that that comes that that City that comes out out of New Jerusalem is is Pyramid shape so you can see how that that theme is just repeated all through scripture that pyramid is the is is is like a uh it's they their interpretation of it was that it was it represented uh a God and three persons but um there's a see it's so close to the truth but see God has not separated the people in the classes so that the masses are led by a holy priesthood it is true that leadership must be holy but then so must be the whole congregation the whole congregation should should be spirit filled there is no place in the world where priests or ministers are such mediate between God and the people nor is there a place where they are separated in their worship of the Lord when you start like Nebuchadnezzar did how would we know that that Nebuchadnezzar that image that he made was an image of Daniel except for the prophet but that see that that that that idea that that Pagan thought process of let's put a man man up and make them somebody that we can worship let's instead of looking at Christ let's look at a man separating the ministers from the people and making the leaders overlords instead of servants that Spirit does let me kind of run through a little bit so we can get where we're going see to confound in Genesis 11:9 because the Lord did their confound the language of all the Earth that word what what what Bale did was to mingle false Doctrine with the true word and the L in strong concordance to mingle to confound means to mix mingle confused so who was merid that merak is is the one Muk and and Jeremiah 50 and uh maybe kind of when you get some a long time go back and reread Jeremiah 50 because that's talking about the end time how the that uh somebody from the north Russia comes down and blows away shoots their ARS at Babylon and and uh destroys them and and you know bail is confounded and so forth uh so I'm going to kind of run through this quickly and if anybody wants these I I put together a huge amount of notes so if you if you're interested I send it up to brother Joe so he can put it on us B for you if you want a copy of it and to go through in your own time and see one common element to nimod Muk and all his manifestations is the symbol of the snake serpent dragon n Nimrod took the dragon as his personal emblem the thread of serpent lore was evident in all am muk's disguises that old Serpent and Christ was sent to bruise the head of the serpent that's where it all started the serpent say it that's that was the problem so now there's that there's that image that we're looking at in Daniel chapter 2 that started off see that that Pagan system that started off with kushan nrod ran right on down through the the Nebuchadnezzar's Kingdom of gold all the way down to the modern agian you can tell something's happened because in in in that chapter we just read Daniel chapter 2 in the days of these 10 Kings God's going to come and set up a kingdom in the days of these 10 Kings God comes and sends a prophet so that that Capstone Revelation come upon the bride and we would believe and and God could come back and set up uh you know that stone will grow into our into our Earth that stone will come back and and you we're getting in Daniel 70 weeks and some things now let me go back to this because you look at this and you see how how God starts his his building with a strong Foundation look the devil starts his with a with a head because you know power without character is satanic you want somebody to look at you you want starting from the from the head look everybody uh wanting notoriety wanting people to look but God starts his from a firm foundation not not built upon sinking Sands but starts it with with humility you know we go upstairs when we take after we take communion we wash each other's feet because you know remember that sermon brother brother Wade preached on on uh the feet being possession and typ in possession and humility and you know everywhere Abraham walked uh God gave him possession of the land and and and those things you can just see how that the approach is different and in Luke 6 4749 he's like a man which built an house and dig deep and laid the foundation on a rock and with the flood arose the scream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it so now when your when your when your life is built upon a revelation of who Jesus Christ is it all the gates of hell cannot Prevail against that what Jesus told Peter so here we go back to Daniel 2: 44 and 45 for as much as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and had him break in pieces the iron the brass the clay and the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure so there's a a stone that came out of the mountains to destroy all stuff all the false teaching all everything that was started back there in Genesis to usher in a new kingdom where God will have preeminence then notice Rome exists to the end because it went to the end of toes and he's seen mud clay and that's people what we're made out of and iron the strength of Rome run in every one of those Nations and Rome has strength and every nation under heav right Bible says that romanism the Catholic Church will swallow the world them to t t toes run in every Kingdom Under the earth oh there's a good quote that men and women groping about here in Pagan darkness and don't even know it because of those T Toes that the Roman Empire has has spread its influence throughout all the world now iron and collect so you remember I I know a lot of us familiar with all these all these quotes but in 1960 United Nations came together and and Kusha that means iron and and Eisenhower that means iron and kusf that means clay you got together and you know Kusha W this is a picture of him uh yelling and hollering I I'll Crush you to the United States and and U him with shoe yeah said he'll bu us for fireing shot y that's what it said pull off his shoe and beat the stand with it and everything else and there's your iron and Clay will not mix so there's there was five Eastern communistic countries represented in five Western countries Mr Kusha was the head of the Eastern countries Mr isenhower is the head of the Western countries but it's in the days of these Empires that the rock stone that was H out of the mountain without P smoked the image and the feet cut out of the mountain must have been a mountain of stone it was cut out of the Mountain of stone now did you notice now he switches over to start talking about the pyramid he's talking about a mountain of stone he talking about now we find out there was another one written another Bible talks about the Zodiac and he comes down to another Bible written he's talking about Enoch's pyramid another one place and that was the pyramid did you notice in the pyramids how it started off wide at the bottom like a pyramid made out of solid rock went right up till it got to the top but there never was a c put on the pyramid take out your if you got a dollar bill in your pocket take out a dollar bill and look on it and you'll find here the American seal on one side on the other side it's got at the bottom of the pyramid and above the pyramid the Capstone but it's a great bigy and it's called at the bottom of this pyramid the Great Seal why ain't the American Eagle the Great Seal that's the Seal of God which looks like that now you remember in second Peter it says without these virtues you can't see far off M the further up the mountain you go the more or you can see brother R there's a quote where he said things the higher up you go that the the more things look different like a child grow up you know that you could start to to see more things than you could when you were younger and there's that Babylonian P symbol p symbol of God which is so close and they put like we talked about last time they put the Greek for uh the Roman Catholic Church put the Greek symbols for I am that I am in the middle of there and and and it it it's real close but it to them it means something different because they're looking at it through theological just intellectual eyes that headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ and every one of us that's got that magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that stone strikes the image the church will flee to it back in the glory she'll be taken up at the rature of the Saints When She Goes Forth through that day the stone that was come out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do it does away with the Gentile age it's all over and God completely quits dealing with him let him that's filthy be filthy still let him that's holy be holy still see what does he do then he takes his church the Holy Ghost feel when that when that Capstone comes back here's what happen the rising of the Saints makes the march in the glory what happened at that time the coming of that stone up went the church into Glory at the Rapture cause an end of the Gentile dispensation God ended it up the coming of that stone remember there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands come rolling into Babylon and tearing it down wherever it went and the kingdom of this world will fall just as certain every man-made kingdoms got to sink so the kingdom of God can take the ride away now now that's in the natural but what about the spiritual what about my life I I all these little kingdoms of my heart where you got a little denominational idea or an idea that some a message Minister told you years ago this that's keeping you from Full communion with God that all these kingdoms are going to be teared down are being torn down by God's work in you when that Capstone comes it's going to it'll destroy every every all the you know like in the Bible Study last night brother brother Dale was talking about how that the Holy Ghost in fire comes and burns out everything that's not right all the way up it's burning out and leaving behind all these virtues and then when this Capstone comes and I I'm I'm I'm kind of trying to lay a a foundation for brother for brother Wade to just come up me so uh every man-made Kingdom's got to sink so the kingdom of God can take the ride away every man-made organization will fall and crumble to the dust that the power of the Holy Ghost might take the church and Rapture it into that place up above the stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands is rolling in crashing down babyon moving right on over he could not bruise it with the problem I'm I'm I'm try to see that that same that Cornerstone is The Headstone see that's what's so beautiful what started it is going to be what's what what caps it off it in the church it was the Cornerstone in in the full church it was The Headstone because that stone is Christ and I believe that when it's coming that church WIll shape into a place from justification of the Luther and so on he was the lamb that Daniel saw that was heed out of the mountain without hands but the true church all over the world is shap down to a place that there's coming a Ministry among them just exactly like the ministry of Jesus Christ this Rejects Stone to the pyramid cut out of the mountain without what without hands God sent it do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the head the Capstone and the Very one that they rejected through this Gentile age is Christ and Christ was not cut and put in here as a b Son of God or some great dignitary in the church he's the Holy Spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be Christ up see you see it and here's this is this this is some quotes I was trying to get to so we'll just finish up at the last few quotes the word in the beginning was the word if if you're wondering what what was that mouth he was HED out of the word was HED out and reflected what the word was at the beginning him the word reflected in the Masterpiece in his own likeness God back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of a man the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected the of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work and there's what the the Masterpiece sermon is about it yeah you got Christ on Earth that's a perfect reflection of the pattern in heaven and now in this day God's bringing us to a perfect reflection he's making us into a masterpiece in his own image reflected in his work God and Christ were one and here's another quote and we know that we're far from a masterpiece but we're looking where we were heed from the real Masterpiece and in him we trust just take us to him Lord grant it Lord so you see he has cut wants to cut the church out just like he did the son he did the bride and the groom to be his bride you must be part of him you got to be heed from the word the world cut off of you and just leave the word only live in you the great sculptor is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the Masterpiece for the bride in Daniel 2 verse 35 says and the wind carried them away all the stuff that n Nimrod and Kush and Nebuchadnezzar and all down to the toes the 10 toes the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoked the image became a great mountain and filled the whole Earth now there's something to meditate on feel the whole earth we'll just stop right there
