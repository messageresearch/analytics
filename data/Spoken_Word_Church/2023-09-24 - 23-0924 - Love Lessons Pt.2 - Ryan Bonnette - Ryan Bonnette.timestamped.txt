[0:00] and I'm also teaching Sunday school
[0:02] today so pray for
[0:13] me all right and uh on my last lesson
[0:16] what I had talked about I started on
[0:19] this kind of a series I guess I'm going
[0:20] to be on this for a while maybe about
[0:22] love just in general about love it's a
[0:25] really broad topic and you could talk
[0:28] about this for for forever I mean but
[0:30] this is my part two of that and this
[0:33] lesson is centered on falling in love so
[0:36] basically I'm teaching a lesson on
[0:37] falling in love and you can infer a lot
[0:40] in in this about marriage and I'm going
[0:42] to be making some comparisons to
[0:45] marriage um because Paul did that too
[0:48] and uh so I'm going to be getting into
[0:49] that aspect of it mostly I'm talking
[0:51] about us falling in love with the
[0:53] Lord
[0:55] so uh as I said last time my statement
[0:57] is this I love to love and I hate to
[0:59] Hate and I if I have a decision to make
[1:01] when I have to choose between the two
[1:03] and I have an interaction with somebody
[1:04] that's not going so well I try to
[1:06] gravitate towards a side of loving them
[1:08] and and having the right kind of
[1:10] reaction to just just have a loving
[1:12] response even if theirs isn't very
[1:14] loving sometimes that we all have those
[1:17] things because you know love is a choice
[1:19] and we choose to love the Lord we choose
[1:21] to to read his word we choose to come to
[1:24] church all those things are a personal
[1:26] choice that we make and I believe this I
[1:28] can't find it in the scripture I don't
[1:29] know exactly how to support it but my
[1:31] own belief about this is that love is
[1:33] depending on free moral agency it's all
[1:35] about choice because if it weren't for
[1:37] that we just be robots if God didn't
[1:39] make us with free moral agency we'd just
[1:41] be robots and just being forced into
[1:43] something so it wouldn't be really love
[1:45] so love has a lot to do with
[1:47] choice so and before I get more into the
[1:50] lesson I want to go ahead and pray and
[1:51] ask the Lord to bless this uh lesson
[1:54] Heavenly Father we thank you for um U
[1:57] blessing this a Sunday school lesson
[1:58] here and all the others downstairs
[2:00] just give us understand of your word and
[2:01] let me be a help and encouragement not
[2:02] be an offense to anybody in the things
[2:04] that I say about Bible reading but I
[2:06] believe you laid it on my heart and I
[2:07] just want to go with what you've given
[2:09] me to to teach and I pray just let it be
[2:11] a blessing and and I pray just spark uh
[2:14] that interest in everybody here Lord
[2:16] that's maybe not reading the your word
[2:17] every day that we'd begin doing that and
[2:19] be more sincere about it and pray just
[2:22] bless uh the lesson and pray in Jesus
[2:24] name
[2:24] amen
[2:27] so so really fall in love with the Lord
[2:29] first I think uh yeah this is right okay
[2:32] I thought I might have skipped the slide
[2:34] this is Brother brandom here on the
[2:35] message Abraham listen first you've got
[2:38] to be born again of the spirit of God if
[2:40] you're not you'll never understand the
[2:42] word of God God has said so God said I
[2:46] have hid the Bible from the wise and
[2:48] prudent and will reveal it to babes such
[2:50] as will learn if you want to get
[2:52] anything from God just be a baby open up
[2:55] the Bible fall in love with Jesus that's
[2:59] my whole lesson so if you don't hear
[3:01] anything else I say that's the point of
[3:03] the entire lesson open up the Bible fall
[3:05] in love with Jesus I'm talking about
[3:07] falling in love amen and the number one
[3:10] way that I know to do that all these
[3:12] other things enter into it okay when I'm
[3:13] talking about Bible reading I'm also
[3:14] talking about reading the message
[3:15] listening to the message meditating on
[3:17] the word of God praying um you know and
[3:20] fellowship with other believers of
[3:21] course coming to church and listening to
[3:23] the word here but I'm focusing on the
[3:27] concept of daily Bible reading um I've
[3:30] always talked about this I've always
[3:31] talked about seeky first the kingdom of
[3:33] God in almost every lesson and I feel
[3:35] like maybe I can leave that and go to
[3:37] something else maybe I'm maybe people
[3:38] are tired of hearing it until brother
[3:41] Luis I guess you say Lis unhel uman I
[3:44] think that's how you say it came from
[3:46] Peru and I believe God sent him here to
[3:48] not just to this church but to our
[3:50] country to tell us bunch of Americans
[3:52] start reading the Bible again to listen
[3:55] to the message he said he stood up here
[3:57] over and over again that whole day he
[3:58] was going back and saying look you've
[4:00] got the message you've got the Bible
[4:02] you've got it in so many formats you've
[4:04] got your audio Bible you've got so many
[4:05] versions of the Bible you've got brother
[4:07] benham's whole entire message in your
[4:09] language and uh you got it in print form
[4:12] you've got it in book form I mean in uh
[4:14] tape form there's really no excuse okay
[4:17] to not read the Bible and listen to
[4:19] message and so forth every single day
[4:23] okay so if I can move out of your way
[4:26] whatever I know look I know he he asked
[4:29] for raise of hands and said who's read
[4:31] the Bible cover to cover and so few
[4:33] people rais their hand but I realized
[4:35] that a lot of people might have been
[4:36] bashful and and just didn't want to brag
[4:38] so there should have been more hands
[4:39] went up probably and then maybe some of
[4:41] you haven't read it cover to cover but
[4:43] you read it on a regular basis that's
[4:45] good you don't necessarily have to read
[4:47] the Bible cover to cover I'm just saying
[4:48] have a regular routine of reading the
[4:51] Bible because I feel like maybe Satan
[4:53] has cast a spell in people's eyes and
[4:55] made them think cuz they're in the
[4:56] message they're okay cuz we're at Spoken
[4:58] Word Church we're okay we don't need to
[5:00] read the Bible and if you look at it
[5:02] like it's an option then you may not do
[5:04] it but I never for since 1999 I started
[5:08] my daily Bible reading in 1999 never
[5:10] once did I get up and say am I going to
[5:12] read the Bible today no it's just
[5:14] automatic I just do it like I breathe
[5:16] air it's just automatic I never give it
[5:18] a second thought you know not once so if
[5:21] you think about it like breathing air
[5:23] I've never missed a day of breathing air
[5:26] since 1984 I've breathed air every day
[5:31] several times a day and I do it
[5:33] sincerely there's no problem with having
[5:35] a routine if you're
[5:37] sincere and I I look at it like
[5:39] breathing air because it's necessary to
[5:42] sustain my natural Life Bible reading is
[5:44] necessary to sustain your spiritual life
[5:46] you need it like you need breath you
[5:48] need it like you need food brother Wade
[5:51] makes the analogy about the baby if you
[5:54] uh have a healthy beautiful baby but you
[5:56] close it up in the closet and don't feed
[5:58] it it'll die
[6:00] another condition of a baby is you could
[6:02] it can be malnourished it can be eating
[6:04] but not quite enough so that's to me a
[6:07] Christian if you just come to church and
[6:08] hear the word being preached but don't
[6:09] go home during the week and meditate on
[6:11] it and read your Bible listen to sermons
[6:14] you're going to be malnourished so you
[6:15] won't grow you won't bear fruit so
[6:18] you'll just kind of sustain life but
[6:20] barely you know so it's such an
[6:22] important thing to read the Bible since
[6:25] the last 23 years of daily Bible reading
[6:27] I can look back at so many things in my
[6:28] life choices I've made experiences I've
[6:30] had and everything revolves around that
[6:32] daily Bob reading that's why I'm so
[6:33] adamant about this um it is just so
[6:37] essential so fundamental so and and
[6:39] really really necessary so don't look at
[6:41] it every day like oh I guess I guess I'm
[6:44] not going to do it today Lord I guess I
[6:46] don't have time to be there today Lord
[6:47] I'm a little bit too busy I've got too
[6:49] many other things to do or whatever your
[6:50] excuse is you got to you got to really
[6:52] look at your own life and say what
[6:54] what's getting in my way what's stopping
[6:55] me from reading the Bible every day and
[6:57] if you don't think you need to
[7:00] that's what I'm trying to really address
[7:02] today is is the need for it and make
[7:04] sure you realize it it's a necessity
[7:06] it's not just a good thing to do I was a
[7:08] Baptist when I started reading the Bible
[7:10] every day I was 15 and in the Baptist
[7:13] Church it's it's not really pushed on
[7:15] anybody it's not something anybody feels
[7:16] like they need to do but a lot of us
[7:18] wanted to do it I knew a lot of Baptists
[7:20] that read the Bible I think brother Lis
[7:22] came to the message as a Baptist and a
[7:24] Bible reader as I recall I think I
[7:26] remember him testifying about that
[7:27] brother Dell had already read the Bible
[7:29] when it came to the message a lot of
[7:31] folks in the Baptist Church do it I
[7:32] don't know why it's not so much done in
[7:34] the message and I feel like maybe it
[7:37] might be a misunderstanding of
[7:39] predestination because predestination is
[7:40] taught right from this church but if you
[7:43] misunderstand it and you think that God
[7:46] just handpicked you and he's pushing you
[7:48] through a pipe you're going no matter
[7:49] what maybe you won't read the Bible if
[7:52] you quit looking at like that I look at
[7:54] it like this if you're predestinated you
[7:56] will read the Bible if you're
[7:58] predestinated you will listen to sermons
[8:00] and if you're really bornn again you
[8:01] really will cuz that was unlikely as a
[8:05] Baptist kid that I would do that since I
[8:07] wasn't even told to do it nobody told me
[8:09] it was necessary even come to church
[8:11] it's just like all we believed in get
[8:13] saved you know pray the sinner's prayer
[8:15] you got your ticket so to speak You're
[8:17] set for life once saved always saved
[8:18] doesn't matter if you come to church
[8:19] does matter if you read the Bible but
[8:21] yet there was a hunger in me that's why
[8:22] I started doing it I wanted to know the
[8:23] Lord I fell in love with him and I
[8:25] wanted to know him and that's why I
[8:27] started my Bible reading amen so if that
[8:30] if you approach God on that basis fall
[8:32] in love open your Bible and just
[8:34] continue to fall in love with the Lord
[8:36] it'll work okay it'll be very effective
[8:38] here's just Paul talking about husband's
[8:41] uh husband head of the wife even Christ
[8:43] is the head of the church husbands love
[8:45] your wives even as Christ loved the
[8:46] church he's making comparisons between
[8:48] this love for God and you know our love
[8:50] in marriage so by showing you that I'm
[8:53] just saying you know I'm kind of giving
[8:54] myself license to talk back and forth
[8:56] between the two because I don't want you
[8:57] to think I'm trying to belittle agape
[9:00] love and and say it's just like at best
[9:03] you could say I guess fil love is a type
[9:04] of agape love but agape love is so far
[9:07] superior to filio love so and our love
[9:10] for the Lord should be so far superior
[9:13] to our love for spouse and family and so
[9:16] forth so uh Gabby and I've been reading
[9:18] this devotional uh called The Love Dare
[9:21] if you haven't got this you married
[9:22] couples I highly recommend it it's
[9:25] so already skipped quiet of my things I
[9:28] was going to say here let's say it's
[9:29] about what was that
[9:32] author oh
[9:35] sorry it's written by uh you look it up
[9:38] probably on Amazon we got it from the
[9:40] library but anyway it's Stephen and Alex
[9:42] Kendrick so you look that up if you are
[9:44] interested in getting that book it's a
[9:46] really good book to read it's a
[9:48] devotional and it's what married couples
[9:50] can do together and this is just one
[9:52] that I picked day 48 be kind one to
[9:55] another tender-hearted forgiving each
[9:57] other just as God and in Christ also has
[10:00] forgiven you Ephesians 4 kindness is
[10:04] love and action these are really wordy
[10:07] statements here these really good little
[10:09] nuggets kindness is Love In Action kind
[10:12] of like works is Faith expressed so so
[10:16] you know you have Works uh things like
[10:19] because you believe you do works you
[10:22] know you you uh do things for the Lord
[10:24] because of your faith so uh really works
[10:27] you know faith without works is death I
[10:29] mean you if you really have faith you'll
[10:30] do works you like I say you'll read the
[10:32] Bible you'll you know do other things
[10:34] for the Lord kindness is like that okay
[10:36] kindness is love and action if you love
[10:39] in this case I'm talking about the Lord
[10:41] but if you love even your spouse you'll
[10:43] do things out of kindness Grace you know
[10:46] acts of kindness that you display to
[10:49] that person if patience is how love
[10:52] reacts in order to minimize a negative
[10:55] circumstance then kindness is how love
[10:57] acts to maximize a positive
[11:00] circumstance you really have to think
[11:02] about some of these statements really
[11:03] deep patience avoids a problem kindness
[11:07] creates a blessing one is preventative
[11:10] the other is proactive these two sides
[11:12] of Love Are the cornerstones on which
[11:14] many of the other attributes are built
[11:17] love makes you kind kindness makes you
[11:19] likable when you're kind people want to
[11:21] be around you they see you as being good
[11:24] to them and good for them it also is
[11:27] contagious when someone demonst genine
[11:29] kindness for you it makes you want to do
[11:30] the same in return but a person who is
[11:32] loving and mature won't always wait to
[11:35] respond in kindness they'd rather be the
[11:37] first to show it are you that kind of
[11:39] person in your home with your spouse
[11:42] what would happen in your marriage if
[11:43] the Ephesians 4 passage mentioned above
[11:45] became your standard operating procedure
[11:47] consider how your vertical relationship
[11:48] with God should directly guide and
[11:51] impact your horizontal horizontal
[11:52] relationship with others so so much of
[11:54] our love for the Lord and our our acts
[11:56] of Love toward him and should kind of
[11:59] you know spill over in other areas of
[12:00] your life with your children with your
[12:02] spouse and so
[12:05] forth so really fall in love with the
[12:08] Lord first let me just pause for one
[12:10] second here because I'm going too
[12:12] fast and as I mentioned a while back um
[12:15] you know a lot of this is about keeping
[12:18] open channels you know I want to keep
[12:20] every facet or every channel open
[12:22] between me and the Lord so he can speak
[12:23] to me that's I'm always adamant about
[12:25] doing that so you know every every day
[12:27] there should be other things involved
[12:29] you know um other things like you know
[12:31] like I said listening to sermons don't
[12:33] neglect that when I came in the message
[12:35] I didn't put my Bible down and nor do I
[12:37] you know I don't leave one for the other
[12:40] I do I read them both every day okay
[12:41] that's very
[12:46] important okay so Calvary was the
[12:49] ultimate expression of love John 15
[12:53] greater love hath no man than this that
[12:55] a man lay down his life for his friends
[12:57] and last time also talked about the cond
[12:58] Ascension of God brought condescension
[13:00] of his attributes his great faith came
[13:03] all the way down to just believing like
[13:04] a child where we can understand it his
[13:06] great love came down to this form of
[13:08] filal love or we could grasp it we could
[13:10] begin to understand it you know because
[13:12] marriage is so much like a a love lesson
[13:14] that's what this this whole entire
[13:16] series is about love lessons learning to
[13:18] love through marriage and other
[13:19] relationships it's a lot about learning
[13:22] to love including loving our love for
[13:24] the Lord Matthew 18 except you be
[13:26] converted and becom as a little child
[13:27] you shall not enter the Kingdom of
[13:29] Heaven whosoever therefore shall humble
[13:30] himself as this little child the same is
[13:32] greatest in the Kingdom of
[13:34] Heaven so um I've heard it said I'm a
[13:37] truck driver not a business guy but I've
[13:39] heard it said you know best practices
[13:41] you kind of in business you kind of
[13:42] emulate what other people are doing if
[13:45] if it works and you do the same thing
[13:46] they're doing you get the same results
[13:48] so look at I look at brother and sister
[13:50] Dell um I consider them to be
[13:52] successfully married there are my
[13:54] definition of successful marriage
[13:56] because they've been married not just so
[13:58] long but because they're still
[13:59] sweethearts brother and sister Tatum
[14:01] were an example to me um when I was
[14:03] younger sister Janet took some of those
[14:05] young people to their house and I got to
[14:07] see firsthand what real sweethearts are
[14:09] like and so you you look at these
[14:11] married couples who are successful and
[14:13] then you try to do what they're doing
[14:15] and one thing I know that they do in one
[14:17] way or another they put Christ in their
[14:19] marriage it's not supposed to be just
[14:20] husband and wife on a joint venture
[14:23] supposed to be Christ in the marriage
[14:24] and I do that I mean gab do that by
[14:26] reading the Bible together but if you
[14:28] even just talk about the Lord together
[14:29] you know that's that accomplishes that
[14:31] to me I
[14:32] believe part of our daily devotion time
[14:35] to the Lord should include meditation on
[14:37] him and on his word that he has revealed
[14:39] to us meditation on his word coupled
[14:41] with prayer and singing praises to Him
[14:44] will cause us to fall more in love with
[14:46] him so somewhere have a place where you
[14:48] meet with the Lord it doesn't have to be
[14:50] you set aside 4 hours a day and you know
[14:53] cuz I know people don't have time for
[14:54] that incorporate it into your daily
[14:56] routine whatever you do you know into
[14:58] your drive into you're doing dishes you
[14:59] can always be listening to a sermon
[15:01] meditating on the word of God um while
[15:03] you're doing anything really there's so
[15:05] many mindless chores we do I call them
[15:07] mindless chores because you don't need
[15:08] lot of concentration to do some of the
[15:10] things we do every day and that you can
[15:12] incorporate this somehow be playing a
[15:14] sermon be singing to the Lord do
[15:16] something you know for the Lord at all
[15:17] all the time and if you're not reading
[15:19] the Bible also I would say this when I
[15:22] was 15 I didn't read five chapters a day
[15:24] I started off reading like one chapter a
[15:26] day but as you do that you begin to fall
[15:28] in love with the Lord and you want to
[15:29] read more and you want to read more and
[15:31] then you gradually want to do more as
[15:33] your love increases but the point is you
[15:35] got to start this somewhere there has to
[15:38] be a time if you're not reading the
[15:39] Bible at all one chapter a day is better
[15:42] than nothing so start there so simple
[15:45] read one chapter a day at least you know
[15:48] this is also an effective method in
[15:49] marriage think about your spouse
[15:51] sometime each day while singing Love
[15:52] Songs wedding songs think about when the
[15:54] two of you first fell in love your first
[15:56] date your first meeting in life never
[15:58] lose lose that love you had never leave
[16:00] that sweetheart stage likewise with the
[16:03] Lord never lose your first love for him
[16:05] always remember when he saved you the
[16:07] first time you realized you were
[16:08] forgiven for your sins every time he
[16:10] revealed something to you
[16:12] Etc so real love comes from God real
[16:15] love is like a seed in your heart if
[16:17] it's genuine you plant it in good ground
[16:20] a heart of Faith water at the word it'll
[16:22] grow
[16:24] stronger also uh I believe too an aspect
[16:27] of love that maybe we don't think about
[16:28] a lot of times is getting to know
[16:30] somebody really intimately getting to
[16:32] know somebody and you fall in love more
[16:34] and in this case most I'm talking about
[16:35] our love with the Lord that's why I read
[16:37] his word because I want to know him and
[16:39] in that I'll begin to fall more in love
[16:41] with him and same thing applies to
[16:46] marriage our love for God our love for
[16:49] our spouse should grow stronger every
[16:51] day this is accomplished by cultivating
[16:53] that seed of love you planted when you
[16:54] got married and there I have a picture
[16:56] of the two that couple there reading the
[16:58] Bible together I know not everybody may
[17:00] be able to do that um for one reason or
[17:02] another but um you know if you can I
[17:05] highly recommend that L Bible reading
[17:07] together not to replace your individual
[17:10] reading of course because I still read
[17:12] my own I have my own devotional but gab
[17:14] and I read every day together um our
[17:17] Bible and listen to sermons together and
[17:19] read things like I showed you that
[17:20] devotional book uh Spurgeon would like
[17:23] to read a lot of different Christian
[17:25] authors Pilgrims Progress things like
[17:26] that those are all really good but
[17:28] especially read your Bible together at
[17:30] least like I said at least a chapter a
[17:32] day likewise our love for the Lord
[17:34] should grow stronger every day by
[17:37] cultivating the seed of his word sewing
[17:38] it down watering with more word and
[17:41] faith believing it also giving God
[17:43] constant praise prayers fellowship with
[17:46] other believers it stimulates spiritual
[17:48] growth and love for the Lord to
[17:50] increase
[17:55] so selflessness Philippians 2 let
[17:58] nothing be done through Strife or vain
[18:00] Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each
[18:02] esteem other better than themselves look
[18:05] not every man on his own things but
[18:07] every man also on the things of others 1
[18:10] Corinthians 13 charity suffereth long
[18:12] and His Kind charity envieth not it vth
[18:14] not itself is not puffed up doth not
[18:16] behave itself unseemly seeketh not her
[18:18] own is not easily provoked thinketh no
[18:20] evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but
[18:22] rejoiceth in the truth beareth all
[18:24] things believeth all things hopeth all
[18:26] things and endureth all things
[18:29] so really again more slides about really
[18:31] falling in love with the Lord this has
[18:32] to be more than affection you know in my
[18:35] early journey I started I had this like
[18:37] feeling of love for the Lord and that's
[18:39] good but it's got to be stronger than
[18:41] that same thing in marriage you know you
[18:43] start off with this little pppy love
[18:44] Stage but it's got to go beyond that so
[18:47] it's got to be something stronger and
[18:49] it's got to be more intimate and real
[18:51] and has to be based on something besides
[18:53] just affection you know right after
[18:56] realization you are really a sinner
[18:59] Bound for hell but Christ died to save
[19:01] you you will really appreciate him and
[19:02] begin to fall in love with
[19:04] him so after U let's see that's the same
[19:09] that's a repeat this starts a cycle that
[19:11] continues throughout your entire
[19:12] Christian Journey you love him seek him
[19:15] realize more that what he has done for
[19:17] you and fall more in love with
[19:20] him uh this real love will cause you to
[19:22] seek him more and become more like him
[19:24] grow up the stature of perfect
[19:26] man now this is quote from Brother Wade
[19:29] from just a couple months ago July the
[19:32] Holy Ghost is the most important thing
[19:33] in your life whether you got it or not
[19:35] you've got to know that you know that
[19:37] you know before you can even start with
[19:39] these virtues but listen with the Holy
[19:41] Ghost you can catch up real quick
[19:42] because God said he wouldn't leave
[19:44] anybody behind if you make yourself
[19:45] available that's the key that's what I'm
[19:47] talking about I'll promise you God will
[19:49] give it to you he'll pour it in if
[19:51] you'll just if you just want it bad
[19:53] enough but Bob
[19:56] from last month how how do I know my
[19:59] name was written on the Lamb's Book of
[20:01] Life because you're acting it out now
[20:03] whether or not your name is written is
[20:05] determined by your reaction now present
[20:07] tense what's happening right now but to
[20:10] think that God has a place reserved for
[20:11] you because he knew your reaction right
[20:13] now how it would be he knew when it was
[20:15] offered to you if you respond or not you
[20:19] know um my statement for a while has
[20:21] been I've been saying this um you don't
[20:23] have to sit and wonder if you're
[20:24] predestinated open the Bible and prove
[20:26] it open the Bible search the scriptures
[20:28] in them you think you have eternal life
[20:30] right that's what Jesus said so genuine
[20:33] love will spill over into other areas of
[20:34] your life I said that a while ago
[20:36] parenting and marriage and so forth uh
[20:38] this is Brother ban from Jehovah Gyra
[20:40] number three that's the way it is with
[20:42] God we're not trying to study some
[20:43] newspaper stand standpoint some
[20:45] theological standpoint but fall in love
[20:47] with him get down and really get him in
[20:49] your heart the love of God shed abroad
[20:50] in the Heart by the Holy Ghost then go
[20:52] to reading the Bible and you'll see it
[20:54] coming right out between the lines you
[20:56] see you know what what he's saying he
[20:57] never never said it right out in the
[20:59] word just thank the father because he he
[21:01] had hid those things from the eyes of
[21:03] wide and prud wise and
[21:07] prudent so John 14 if you love me keep
[21:10] my Commandments Thy word about hid in my
[21:12] heart that I might not sin against thee
[21:13] Thy word is a lamp that was Psalm 119 uh
[21:17] this one is Thy word is a lamp to my
[21:19] feet and a light to my
[21:22] path God sent um this is what I was
[21:25] saying while ago I just didn't know if
[21:26] I'd get to it so I jumped the gun God
[21:28] sent a minister here from Peru brother
[21:30] Lis uh to remind us to read the Bible
[21:33] and the message that was quite a rebuke
[21:36] and uh you know that God would have to
[21:37] send somebody from another country a
[21:39] third world country where they maybe
[21:40] don't even have all the messages send it
[21:42] here where we do have all the sermons
[21:43] and remind us you need to be reading it
[21:45] you know because he goes a lot of other
[21:46] churches and he got in trouble he
[21:48] talking about getting in trouble with
[21:49] other ministers and things and I guess
[21:51] about bringing that kind of thing out
[21:53] just kind of making people mad you know
[21:54] but we need to read it brother bham not
[21:57] only spoke Engish English but he spoke
[21:58] our dialect you know he's Southern
[22:00] hillbilly Kentucky English I mean
[22:03] there's no reason and I guess that's
[22:04] really why because Jesus said uh a
[22:07] prophet is not without honor Sav among
[22:09] his own country and among his own kin so
[22:11] because he's at our back door up here in
[22:13] Kentucky and because he's just a
[22:15] southerner I guess we tend to say that's
[22:16] just brother brandom no that's a message
[22:20] brother's always saying we've had a
[22:21] message we've had a message and we just
[22:23] need to dig into it perhaps we take for
[22:26] granted the mighty word of God delivered
[22:27] to us through such a simple Kentucky man
[22:30] Matthew 13 and they were offended him
[22:32] but Jesus said unto them Prophet is not
[22:33] without honor I just quoted that all
[22:35] right brother Lis oman's message was
[22:38] simple in essence he was saying God
[22:40] God's promises are on conditions you
[22:42] don't automatically receive them by
[22:44] being in the message this is not
[22:46] automatic okay just because you're here
[22:48] you know I came here from the Baptist
[22:50] Church but I've been studying the
[22:51] message in the Bible I didn't just show
[22:52] up you know we must attach ourselves to
[22:55] the word by reading prayer listening to
[22:57] sermons like our life depends on it
[22:59] because it does daily Bible reading is
[23:01] enormously important to a child of God
[23:03] it's absolutely necessary for spiritual
[23:05] growth like a newborn baby must eat to
[23:07] grow we must eat spiritually to grow and
[23:10] a sufficient amount of spiritual food is
[23:14] necessary uh let's see skip on down this
[23:16] is message Abraham God reveal it to babe
[23:18] such as will believe if you want
[23:20] anything from God just be a baby open up
[23:21] the Bible and fall in love with Jesus so
[23:24] this is Brother Dell from uh the message
[23:26] brotherly kindness
[23:28] from a series being born again back in
[23:31] this month actually it was about 5 years
[23:32] ago
[23:33] 2018 so in the spiritual children you've
[23:35] got to get te the word of God study the
[23:37] word of God you know pray and seek God
[23:39] and ask him to reveal these things to
[23:42] you instead of just saying oh I believe
[23:44] that let it be a part of you and if you
[23:46] have the new birth you will desire it
[23:48] right is that what we read you'll desire
[23:50] the sincere milk of the word that we may
[23:52] grow thereby because see that will be a
[23:54] part of your life why wouldn't you want
[23:56] to grow in Christ why would would you
[23:58] not would not that to be a desire to to
[24:00] know more about God uh I think of
[24:03] brother Zach black he got born again and
[24:06] almost the next thing I remember him
[24:07] testify about was a dream that he had
[24:10] where he was eating right he was eating
[24:12] a meal and he kept eating eating
[24:13] couldn't get full to me it's obvious the
[24:15] Lord was telling him you're born again a
[24:17] newborn babe now you need to eat and
[24:19] that's what he does I meet him at work
[24:21] all the time he's got that Bluetooth on
[24:22] listening to sermons same same thing I'm
[24:24] doing we're both feeding on the word of
[24:25] God constantly and that's why I started
[24:27] it and Church nobody told me I needed to
[24:29] read the Bible I I didn't even think it
[24:31] was necessary I thought it was just a
[24:32] good thing to do but it's not just a
[24:34] good thing to do it's necess it's a
[24:37] necessity really it is for your growth
[24:39] if you're really born again you'll
[24:41] desire it and you'll really want to to
[24:42] get into Christ uh musicians can go
[24:44] ahead and come these are some reasons
[24:46] I'll probably try to get into this more
[24:47] next time why people don't read the
[24:49] Bible these are some things that I think
[24:50] of may be people have as excuses um I
[24:54] don't have time I've read it before I
[24:56] don't understand it it's too simple to
[24:58] be of value you know we we we make it
[25:01] it's always God in Simplicity God hides
[25:02] and reveals himself in Simplicity Bible
[25:04] reading just seems like such a simple
[25:06] thing to do with think I just just my
[25:08] Bible I'll read it tomorrow it'll be
[25:09] there tomorrow I'll read it whenever you
[25:11] or you feel
[25:12] unworthy I was still addicted to
[25:15] pornography when I started reading my
[25:16] Bible that's how I overcame pornography
[25:19] as a 15-year-old kid I didn't even know
[25:21] about sanctification I started reading
[25:22] my Bible every day and pornography and
[25:24] about 6 months left and hasn't been back
[25:27] since 25 about 25 years ago or 24 years
[25:29] ago no relapse I didn't suppress it it's
[25:33] gone uh profanity I was using cuss
[25:35] wordss until about a year after I
[25:36] started reading my Bible it left okay
[25:39] this is you you may feel unworthy start
[25:41] doing it Watch What Happens y don't we
[25:44] don't want to become a routine again I
[25:46] say I breathe out of routine but I'm
[25:49] sincere when I do it we all breathe and
[25:50] eat and everything else we do in life is
[25:52] routine but that's no excuse not to read
[25:53] the Bible just do it and do it with
[25:56] sincerity and that's all I have for
[25:57] today God bless you
[26:01] [Applause]
