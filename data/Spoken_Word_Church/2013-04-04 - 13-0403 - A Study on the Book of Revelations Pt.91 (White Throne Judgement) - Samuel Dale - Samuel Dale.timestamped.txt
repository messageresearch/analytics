[6:57] you know i don't have time
[6:59] i don't answer to anybody else that's
[7:01] right that's right an answer to him in
[7:04] that way you know if that's going to
[7:06] send us somewhere then we'll get there i
[7:08] guess but
[7:09] you know okay if you want to turn in
[7:11] your scripture turn to revelations 1 and
[7:14] revelations 20.
[7:17] just pray for the sick among us and on
[7:19] these many things and
[7:21] many of
[7:22] us are having problems you know when the
[7:24] age factor is involved with a lot of us
[7:27] and that's doing it too but we don't
[7:30] have to give up
[7:31] we can just stand on our own and go on
[7:34] now we're changing about at the back
[7:36] back there and tonight i was in three
[7:39] places and out in the hallway
[7:41] so i'm doing pretty good they're gonna
[7:42] find a place for me eventually
[7:44] you know but that's okay we'll get it
[7:46] all done i appreciate these brothers
[7:48] that are doing it you know and getting
[7:50] everything set and it'll be a whole lot
[7:52] better for us to operate
[7:53] better camera systems and different
[7:55] things before we can
[7:57] get a better view and
[7:59] doing things and we certainly do
[8:01] appreciate
[8:02] all that are working and doing so you
[8:04] just remember these and tell them how
[8:05] much you appreciate them
[8:06] you know and
[8:08] the lord will bless us father we thank
[8:10] you for an opportunity tonight to come
[8:12] out
[8:13] we thank you that you would just
[8:15] give us this opportunity
[8:18] because lord without you there would be
[8:20] no air to breathe there'd be no
[8:23] food to eat there'd be nothing
[8:26] because you're god
[8:28] and you supply all things
[8:30] we thank you we just ask you now to be
[8:32] here tonight with us not as an onlooker
[8:35] to watch what we're doing and record it
[8:37] but yet lord to be here as the one to
[8:39] open your word
[8:40] and that you would speak to each one of
[8:42] our hearts
[8:43] lord we love you and we thank you
[8:46] we just committed all into your hands
[8:48] now believing that you will take care of
[8:51] all things
[8:52] because we we love you and we thank you
[8:54] forgive our sins
[8:56] cleanse us and keep us down in jesus
[8:58] name
[8:59] amen
[9:01] revelations 1
[9:06] 1-3
[9:08] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[9:10] gave unto him the show and to his
[9:12] servants things which might shortly come
[9:14] to price and he sent and signified it by
[9:16] his angel unto his servant john
[9:19] who by record of the word of god and the
[9:21] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[9:23] things that he saw
[9:25] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[9:27] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[9:29] those things which are written to our
[9:31] end for what for the time is at hand
[9:35] what the time to reveal
[9:37] okay now let's go over to revelations 20
[9:41] and we'll begin reading about verse 11.
[9:46] and i saw a great white throne and him
[9:48] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[9:52] and the heaven fled away
[9:54] there was found no place for them
[9:57] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[9:59] before god
[10:00] and the books were open and another book
[10:02] was open which is the book of life and
[10:05] the dead were judged out of those things
[10:07] which were written in the books
[10:09] according to their works
[10:11] and the sea gave up the dead which would
[10:13] were in it
[10:15] and death and hell delivered of the dead
[10:17] which were in them
[10:19] and they were judged every man according
[10:21] to their works
[10:22] and death and hell were cast into the
[10:24] lake of fire
[10:25] this is the second death
[10:28] and whosoever was not found written in
[10:30] the book of life was cast into the lake
[10:33] of fire
[10:35] you may be seated the lord added
[10:36] blessing
[10:38] to the reading of the word now we've
[10:40] been in the book of revelations and
[10:42] we're finally getting over to the part
[10:44] that we
[10:45] enjoy speaking about and lord willing
[10:48] will pick up sunday
[10:50] and get on the end of revelation 21 and
[10:52] 22 to be able to try to
[10:54] to um you know
[10:58] speak on a few things and uh you know
[11:01] then we'll move on to some other topic
[11:03] but of course we could stay i was
[11:05] looking today i was laughing my own self
[11:08] because we could stay right here at this
[11:10] point
[11:12] and spend three months just speaking
[11:14] from this scripture that i read tonight
[11:16] so you probably now by now realize it
[11:19] could be done so you know it uh but
[11:22] we'll try not to i want to try to move
[11:24] into a place because that's what we want
[11:27] to see is
[11:28] the future but see it by revelation
[11:32] now remember what we were talking about
[11:34] sunday
[11:35] that
[11:36] you know talking about the resurrection
[11:39] and see martha said to jesus
[11:43] when he spoke to her about lazarus
[11:47] and she said you know
[11:49] lazarus will rise again in the end time
[11:53] and
[11:54] you know she believed in that they
[11:56] believed in a general resurrection or a
[11:59] resurrection of all mankind you know
[12:01] they're going there
[12:03] but when she spoke and said whatever you
[12:06] say now or whatever you speak
[12:09] the lord will honor that in other words
[12:11] paraphrasing the scripture
[12:13] right
[12:14] and the prophet of god said that touched
[12:16] him
[12:18] and he turned to her and he says i am
[12:20] the resurrection
[12:23] that your brother will raise right now
[12:26] right because i am the resurrection all
[12:28] right and i said that was like sister
[12:30] hattie wright when she spoke to brother
[12:32] brother around spoken and she spoke back
[12:34] and said that ain't nothing but the
[12:35] truth
[12:37] and she got salvation for her two
[12:39] children right and like elijah was when
[12:42] the the widow woman you know
[12:44] when i mean i went over the woman's son
[12:46] that had passed away and
[12:48] and she went there you know and she had
[12:50] confidence in him and he said well here
[12:52] take the staff servant and run over lay
[12:54] it on the child maybe you know
[12:56] pre-adventure he knew that the staff was
[12:58] anointed
[12:59] and maybe things would be all right she
[13:00] told her she said i'm gonna leave it
[13:02] right
[13:03] that's right i'm not leaving do you go
[13:06] with me
[13:07] well you know that touched him well you
[13:09] know what he may have to pray may have
[13:11] had to pray seven times laying over the
[13:12] body of that child but yet the child
[13:14] came to life
[13:16] because that was a great thing
[13:18] see what i'm trying to do is talk about
[13:21] revelations not the book of revelations
[13:25] but revelation itself
[13:27] because without revelation we cannot be
[13:30] saved
[13:32] all right
[13:33] see he that cometh to god must believe
[13:35] that he is in a rewarder of them that
[13:37] diligently seek him the scripture says
[13:39] all right so then we must have a
[13:41] revelation
[13:43] not just a concept or a thought
[13:47] and not just to speak on something and
[13:49] say well we're glad we know this is what
[13:52] this is
[13:53] you know maybe others before us knew
[13:55] what that was also
[13:57] but to speak of it from ourselves
[14:01] and try to
[14:02] to be able to
[14:05] uh
[14:06] bring about
[14:07] a revelation within ourselves
[14:10] and what i want to do tonight and i'll
[14:11] repeat it again in a minute but what i
[14:13] want to do tonight
[14:15] this is the prophet of god says
[14:17] revelations and daniel is daniel is the
[14:20] book of revelation of the old testament
[14:22] in other words so what's in the book of
[14:24] revelations is over the book of daniel
[14:26] we went through some of those things all
[14:28] right now when we get to it in a minute
[14:30] i want to just compare the two
[14:33] writings
[14:35] of revelations and and daniel
[14:38] and do it in the basis you remember when
[14:40] brother branham was preaching the seals
[14:42] and he got over to the sixth seal
[14:45] and he said
[14:46] uh now i thought i'd just take something
[14:48] a little different tonight instead of
[14:50] just pounding on what that was
[14:53] he said you know i want to do something
[14:56] different and he did he took matthew 24
[14:59] and compared it with revelation 6. amen
[15:03] all right now that'll be the form of
[15:05] what we're going to be trying to do
[15:06] tonight is compare or see
[15:10] reading
[15:11] both accounts
[15:13] and seeing that both accounts are
[15:15] speaking of the great white throne
[15:18] judgment that is to come
[15:20] but yet to see that maybe one will say
[15:23] one thing
[15:24] the other will say another
[15:26] all right then if you can't you know not
[15:28] something different now but more meaning
[15:31] will be taken into account in one
[15:34] writing
[15:35] than it is in the other writing
[15:37] all right
[15:38] and that way see then we can study the
[15:40] bible that way
[15:42] you know
[15:43] you you can study it and see it that
[15:45] comparing scripture with scripture
[15:48] goes that way then you know where you're
[15:50] standing
[15:51] see you're not taking somebody's idea or
[15:54] a thought
[15:55] then you're taking what the scriptures
[15:58] say
[16:00] and if we can't depend on the scriptures
[16:01] we've surely got a problem right you
[16:04] know
[16:05] but what else could we depend on you
[16:07] certainly can't depend on the
[16:09] on the land and the governments and the
[16:11] and the the things today all of these
[16:14] dominions we'll read in a minute are
[16:15] falling
[16:16] drastically
[16:18] and everything's going just like i said
[16:20] the other day about cyprus there that
[16:22] you know i i don't know where they
[16:24] released it yet i haven't kept up with
[16:25] it but the whole country the banks were
[16:28] shut down until you couldn't get your
[16:30] money out of the bike right
[16:31] well then when they shut it down to try
[16:33] to juggle the books as we call it you
[16:35] know borrow the money or do whatever
[16:37] they've done
[16:38] now they're afraid to open them up
[16:40] because afraid everybody's going to run
[16:41] in and get all their money out at one
[16:43] time
[16:44] and and see it's just a bad shape all
[16:46] around right so we certainly don't want
[16:48] to depend on anything else but we can
[16:49] defend upon the word of god
[16:51] because it will always be true
[16:54] now but that's what i want you to think
[16:55] about we read here in the book of dang a
[16:57] book of revelations
[16:59] that says that there was a great white
[17:03] throne
[17:05] or a great white throne that is known
[17:08] then as what we would call
[17:10] the white throne judgment amen
[17:13] all right
[17:14] now
[17:15] there will be a white throne judgment
[17:17] we're wanting to read
[17:18] who it is
[17:20] who's judging and what is going on
[17:23] and read it out of the scriptures but
[17:25] just make comments along the way to to
[17:28] be able to
[17:30] do it but get the point now
[17:34] maybe daniel will say one thing
[17:38] um
[17:40] john in revelations won't say it that
[17:42] way
[17:44] but yet once you see both of them coming
[17:46] together
[17:47] they're saying the same thing
[17:50] but one is giving more understanding
[17:54] than the other is
[17:56] and it is it'll open up into a beautiful
[17:58] picture and then we can read the
[18:00] scriptures that what
[18:02] you know
[18:02] instead of just reading an isolated
[18:04] scripture
[18:06] all right
[18:08] let me read your scripture the scripture
[18:09] says
[18:11] judas went and hung himself
[18:14] about the scripture right right did i
[18:16] turn over a little while and the bible
[18:18] finally says
[18:19] and you go do likewise
[18:23] well now
[18:24] i'm not comparing the scriptures right
[18:27] i'm just picking words off of a page
[18:31] to prove my point or to say what i want
[18:33] it to say
[18:36] that's not the way that i'm talking
[18:38] about it i'm talking about taking things
[18:41] in the word and seeing that the bible
[18:45] is self-explanatory
[18:48] we're getting here in the book of
[18:49] revelations we have a lot of symbols
[18:51] back in the the beginnings of where we
[18:54] were bringing out of of the beast and
[18:56] the things you know that was there and
[18:59] the dragons and the things in the book
[19:00] of revelation
[19:02] and we had to depend upon the prophet to
[19:04] be uh to give us a an understanding
[19:07] because that's what he came for has to
[19:09] break the symbols but then he put it
[19:10] right in the scriptures himself
[19:13] so we can depend on the scriptures and i
[19:14] hope down through there we we've done
[19:16] enough of it you don't understand
[19:18] but here in revelation it's not a symbol
[19:23] this just simply just says that the
[19:24] white throne
[19:27] and then it says who's going to be
[19:29] judged
[19:31] and then it says who's going to do the
[19:33] judging
[19:35] you know and the things that will take
[19:37] place
[19:38] all right so then we don't have to worry
[19:40] about symbols tonight
[19:43] we don't have to worry about you know we
[19:45] can read ourselves and see what it says
[19:48] right
[19:49] and see then that way then we can read
[19:51] the book
[19:52] and understand
[19:53] but now
[19:55] what i want you to look at first is just
[19:57] a couple of points now we've got a
[19:59] brother in this room and a brother in
[20:00] that room
[20:03] brother anderson's over here and brother
[20:05] over there because we're having to
[20:06] divide up everything tonight to get it
[20:08] fixed where we can operate
[20:10] but one of them's going to get it up and
[20:13] i know it's brother anderson but go
[20:14] ahead and pull up number one brother
[20:16] anderson and let's just see what the
[20:18] prophet had to say about this
[20:20] and now i'm showing you up front
[20:24] about the throne reading it about the
[20:26] throne what it is
[20:28] uh who's at the throne who's sitting on
[20:30] the drone
[20:32] and and the things that as that will be
[20:34] at the the white trump judgment
[20:37] because
[20:38] everybody's going to stand that judgment
[20:40] that is not
[20:42] born again amen that's right
[20:45] but now if you're born again you don't
[20:46] have to go to judge amen because you're
[20:49] already judged
[20:50] all right why would you want anybody
[20:52] judging anybody that's already judged
[20:54] that double jeopardy in the day well you
[20:56] can't do that
[20:58] you know
[20:59] not supposed to
[21:07] but now
[21:08] just think about what he's saying
[21:11] who's at the judgment when is it
[21:13] what's taking place all right this is
[21:15] questions and answers real number one
[21:17] 1964 823
[21:20] uh the morning service paragraph 222
[21:24] now here now there you are
[21:26] to the question while i go to at the
[21:28] judgment seat
[21:30] jesus the church the bride was raptured
[21:34] now remember how we brought it out
[21:36] we go up in revelations 4 1
[21:40] because that's john going up
[21:42] we're not seeing any more on earth until
[21:44] revelations 19 which we just got through
[21:47] covering to be the millennial reign and
[21:50] we come back with him we're not seen on
[21:52] earth in between so look what he's
[21:53] saying
[21:54] jesus the church of bride was
[21:57] went raptured
[21:57] in the glory and he grew up there and
[21:59] was married
[22:00] returned back to the earth and lived a
[22:02] thousand years
[22:04] at the end of the thousand years satan
[22:06] was loosed out of his prison remember
[22:08] that's in the scripture right above
[22:09] where we were at there
[22:12] that is bound by an angel with a chain
[22:16] not a lot of chain you remember you
[22:17] can't do that with satan you can't
[22:19] you couldn't change him you couldn't put
[22:20] him in a building lock the keys on him
[22:22] it doesn't work he's a spirit all right
[22:25] but a chain of circumstances now what's
[22:27] the circumstances we read this before
[22:30] all of his subjects were in hell
[22:34] all of satan's subjects at this time
[22:36] that we're looking about tonight
[22:38] all of his subjects will be in hell
[22:42] you know all his people
[22:45] and
[22:46] because
[22:47] he can't work anybody
[22:51] because why all that was resurrected on
[22:53] the earth were redeemed in jesus with
[22:55] him he couldn't work on nothing but at
[22:58] the end of the thousand years the second
[23:00] resurrection
[23:01] blessed and holy is he to have part in
[23:03] the first resurrection over which the
[23:05] second death has no power and notice in
[23:07] this second resurrection when they come
[23:09] up then satan's loose out of his prison
[23:12] now the bible says he looks for a little
[23:13] season that revelation right
[23:16] then judgment is set
[23:18] now watch jesus with the bride as king
[23:21] and queen
[23:22] said at the throne watch their own
[23:24] judgment and the books were open
[23:26] and the books are the sinners see the
[23:28] books are open the books of the center
[23:30] and another book was open which was the
[23:32] book of life and every man was judged
[23:34] thus by the bride all right
[23:37] now we will show in a minute start
[23:39] reading the scriptures you know and
[23:41] backwards and forth of this being
[23:43] correct
[23:44] of the judgments and things like that
[23:46] but just remember it's after the
[23:48] millennial reign amen right
[23:51] and that will be what is known in the
[23:53] terminologies of speaking a general
[23:55] resurrection
[23:58] that basically everybody believes in the
[24:00] resurrection of some form
[24:03] all right
[24:04] whether you want to call it the as i say
[24:06] on sunday where do you want to go with
[24:07] the pharisees or the sadducees the the
[24:10] the sad you're seeing so they believe in
[24:12] the resurrection but more than they
[24:13] believe that ever they believe you're
[24:14] going somewhere
[24:16] they just didn't believe in it the
[24:18] relationship of anything of them
[24:22] could be thought of but the pharisees
[24:23] were kind of
[24:24] lenient about that
[24:26] you know they could believe things but
[24:28] go ahead look at the next one just get
[24:30] these two points
[24:32] this is 1954 questions and answers real
[24:35] two
[24:36] uh 103 the evening series paragraph 68
[24:41] look at this morning's lesson
[24:43] on the lesson on when the judgment set
[24:45] and the books were open and jesus came
[24:48] with ten thousand
[24:50] ten thousands of saints ten thousand
[24:53] thousand times ten thousand
[24:55] and then the judgment said
[24:56] here they all are around the white
[24:59] throne judgment
[25:00] as we went through the scripture with it
[25:02] and the books were opened
[25:04] another book was open which is the book
[25:05] of life
[25:06] and these and the rapture was judging
[25:08] them
[25:10] all right is that right then that done
[25:13] went home and received their glorified
[25:15] bodies which is you and i
[25:17] and lived through the millennium
[25:19] was hearing in the white throne judging
[25:22] those he said he'd separate the sheep
[25:24] from the goats all right you remember
[25:25] that in jesus name
[25:29] jesus said there'd come a time that the
[25:31] nations would come forth and be judged
[25:33] and separated as sheeps and goats
[25:36] all right
[25:37] now
[25:39] in doing that then
[25:41] think about it
[25:44] the white throne judgment we certainly
[25:46] don't want to go there
[25:49] we don't you don't want to have to
[25:50] appeal your cases to what's on judgment
[25:53] right
[25:53] because it's no uh court of appeal
[25:57] uh when you go there it stops settle
[26:00] finish done
[26:02] you know
[26:04] and we'll get back to that in a minute
[26:05] to see
[26:07] and at the white throne
[26:09] they won't be judging you according to
[26:11] your deeds it'd be according to what you
[26:13] believed
[26:14] or what you didn't believe
[26:18] right
[26:19] to be judging our unbelief instead of
[26:21] our works and deeds
[26:25] but there will be a great white throne
[26:26] judgment
[26:29] but the bride has already lived a
[26:31] thousand years through the millennial
[26:32] run so gone into rapture live a thousand
[26:34] years
[26:35] and comes back to sit on the throng with
[26:38] him and we'll get to that in a moment to
[26:40] to cover it but think about it
[26:44] jesus said
[26:47] they'd be separated as sheeps and goats
[26:52] all right
[26:53] now
[26:54] in doing that matthew 25 32 34 right
[26:56] through there
[26:59] that's been argued backwards and forth
[27:01] of who it would be
[27:02] you know that there'd be sheep and all
[27:04] but notice it says as sheep right
[27:07] it doesn't say sheep because the sheep's
[27:09] done gone right
[27:11] sheep don't stand before the whites on
[27:13] judgment right
[27:14] we'll find out in a little bit when we
[27:16] see there's strongs and things that the
[27:18] sheep are sitting on the throne
[27:21] but these are as sheep
[27:24] all right so who would it be would be
[27:25] coming up at the white throne judgment
[27:29] and these people will
[27:32] come there
[27:34] to be judged
[27:36] all right and to be judged on according
[27:38] to what they've done in their life right
[27:41] now that would be a horrible thing for
[27:44] me to think about
[27:45] right for me to go there i don't know
[27:48] how holy and pious you think you are
[27:51] but that's just the way i talk
[27:53] you think you're good enough that you
[27:55] could get there and win some court of
[27:57] appeal
[27:58] i wouldn't want to do that
[28:00] that's right i don't uh
[28:02] you know i i don't think it would be a
[28:04] good thing because none of our goodness
[28:07] the bible says my righteousness is what
[28:10] guilty rags in the sight of god so
[28:13] there's no
[28:14] part of getting there
[28:16] and maybe something can be worked out
[28:20] remember we'll read in a minute it's
[28:21] their works that they've done so when
[28:23] you come to the white throne judgment
[28:25] it'll be settled stamp finish that's
[28:27] over with you're either going to be
[28:29] given eternal life
[28:33] or you're going to hell
[28:35] right
[28:36] which ain't going to last that long
[28:37] because you're going to be cast into the
[28:38] lake of fire then you're going to be
[28:39] burning for a long time
[28:41] but
[28:42] just getting the point now
[28:47] i don't want to go there
[28:49] i don't want a standard judgment
[28:53] you know
[28:55] i i wouldn't want to it's kind of like
[28:58] my sister told her one time that
[29:01] she uh got a ticket
[29:03] and uh
[29:05] she obscured the dad what this is going
[29:07] to do with her you know when she got
[29:08] there
[29:09] to the court
[29:10] to our daddy went with her and
[29:13] when they got to the court
[29:16] well the judge was sitting there you
[29:18] know and
[29:19] the judge looks back there and
[29:20] recognizes there's the girl's father and
[29:23] calls his name and said well hello there
[29:25] how you doing she said i felt pretty
[29:27] good
[29:30] because she was thinking maybe
[29:32] maybe he maybe daddy can help me now
[29:36] but just remember
[29:38] if you go to the white throne you're
[29:40] going to stand by yourself
[29:41] there won't be no jesus to represent you
[29:45] there won't be a court of appeal right
[29:47] that you can argue
[29:49] because the bible says that they'll even
[29:51] say have not i cast out devils in thy
[29:54] name and done mighty wonderful works
[29:56] and you know jesus never denied that
[29:58] they that was happening
[30:02] but he said they would say depart from
[30:04] me i never knew you
[30:08] you were never a born-again christian in
[30:10] other words
[30:11] no born-again christian is going to the
[30:13] white throne judgment
[30:15] right
[30:18] we are here being judged in the basis of
[30:21] whether or not we accept jesus christ
[30:25] if we accept him as our savior our
[30:27] judgment is finished amen right we don't
[30:30] have to worry about a court of appeal
[30:31] amen
[30:33] we've got everybody on our side
[30:37] it'd really be great to walk into a
[30:38] courtroom if
[30:41] the judge was your daddy
[30:44] the prosecuting attorney was your
[30:46] brother
[30:48] and you hired your sister to represent
[30:50] you as a lawyer
[30:53] and even that all of your kin folks were
[30:55] sitting on the jury
[30:58] you feel pretty good with you
[31:01] you'd say when y'all get to playing
[31:03] around i'm gonna get me something deep
[31:05] because you know you'd be leaving
[31:07] all right but you see church is a whole
[31:09] lot better than that when you're born
[31:10] again christian right
[31:13] that's why we need a new birth that's
[31:14] why we must be born again that's why we
[31:16] must
[31:21] we must be born again
[31:23] that's right why because we don't have
[31:25] to go to the judgment amen
[31:29] that's a wonderful opportunity we don't
[31:31] have to go back right
[31:33] he paid my price right
[31:38] he just annihilated my records
[31:43] is that what the scripture said to this
[31:45] amen our sins is in the sea of his
[31:47] forgetfulness
[31:49] as far as the east is from the west now
[31:51] if you said north to the south you get
[31:52] messed up but you go east to west you
[31:54] just keep going around and around and
[31:56] around right no matter which way you go
[31:57] you're not going to find a wind win
[32:01] all right
[32:03] see what a wonderful opportunity it is
[32:05] to be a christian
[32:06] amen
[32:10] to say he's paid my price
[32:14] i don't have to
[32:16] go there and beg
[32:19] right
[32:20] you know for a
[32:21] pardon
[32:23] or some form
[32:25] or a dropping of the charges or
[32:27] something
[32:29] i don't have to do that
[32:30] amen
[32:32] my case is already solved
[32:34] and the point that i'm using is to quote
[32:36] show you that the resurrection at the
[32:38] time this will take place this hasn't
[32:40] taken place yet it will be on down
[32:43] the millennium hasn't taken place yet so
[32:45] that's over a thousand years from now
[32:46] before this could take place if the
[32:48] rapture took place today
[32:52] but see when that bride goes in that
[32:54] rapture she's already proof it's proven
[32:56] there
[32:59] paul said you changed in the morning the
[33:00] twinkling time
[33:02] right
[33:03] it's proved
[33:05] it's already finished
[33:09] at this time the bride will have already
[33:11] be
[33:12] body spirit and soul eternal at least a
[33:14] thousand
[33:16] years plus three and a half
[33:18] you know
[33:19] i mean how much you want to count i
[33:20] wouldn't learn about it today because
[33:22] if i'm eternal that's going to be
[33:23] wonderful
[33:27] but it's not going up to heaven to
[33:28] decide whether we're going to get there
[33:30] that's been taught to us but that's not
[33:32] correct right
[33:34] see people say i i hope i'm saved when i
[33:36] i get up there i'll find out whether i
[33:38] am or not well that's true we'll find
[33:41] out we're not right
[33:44] right so what we need is something now
[33:48] i'm like the old fella said i don't want
[33:49] no trouble when i get down to the river
[33:51] i want my ticket in my hand
[33:55] you go over to one of these foreign
[33:57] countries you'd find out in a hurry
[33:59] they got onto me in israel because i
[34:01] carried my passport around in my front
[34:03] pocket
[34:04] i didn't know i didn't think about it
[34:07] and the the guy there he said sam put
[34:10] that
[34:11] passport in your pocket
[34:15] he said they were very valuable over
[34:17] here to other people and said you're
[34:19] publicly advertising it
[34:22] i'm sorry i didn't know
[34:26] but you get over there i don't have a
[34:27] passport
[34:30] uh-huh
[34:34] you know they're gonna have one
[34:37] we had trouble coming back from jamaica
[34:38] one time
[34:40] because we had
[34:44] we had failed to take proof they had
[34:46] asked for proof and we didn't take it
[34:48] and they told us that go down here
[34:51] pay 45 or something a piece and we'll
[34:53] give you the paperwork
[34:56] and you can go
[34:57] but they didn't tell us
[35:00] that that paperwork was not sufficient
[35:02] to get back into the country
[35:04] right
[35:05] they made 45 bucks off of all the three
[35:08] people you know
[35:10] each one of us had to pay that
[35:12] all right when we got over there it was
[35:14] fine man yeah yeah you're welcome
[35:18] we got back to atlanta and they said uh
[35:21] that's not sufficient to get back in
[35:24] i knew right then i've been conned out
[35:26] of
[35:26] three times 45. you know
[35:30] it just happened that we had our
[35:32] driver's license and things to prove who
[35:35] we were
[35:36] and they accepted that and let us come
[35:38] back
[35:39] but the point is
[35:40] i don't want no trouble when i get down
[35:42] to the river
[35:44] i want my ticket in my hand i want to be
[35:47] ready to step over
[35:48] into eternity and no problems
[35:52] he paid the price all i've got to do is
[35:54] accept it
[35:57] he made the way all i've got to do is
[35:59] say thank you lord i accept that
[36:04] he then just make sure he got the ticket
[36:05] all right
[36:06] but now listen
[36:09] it is not the bride it's going to be at
[36:11] the
[36:12] what drone
[36:14] you know standing there to be judged
[36:17] right we'll get around to it a minute
[36:18] should be actually the one on the throne
[36:20] judging
[36:21] but look what the prophet says number
[36:23] three go ahead brother
[36:27] brother anderson pull it up
[36:30] 1964 of 61 human uh
[36:34] 10 15 morning service questions and
[36:36] answers paragraph 189
[36:40] let's see right around what happens to
[36:42] the people that are are considered the
[36:44] sleeping virgins remember that matthew
[36:47] 25.
[36:48] five wives five foolish now consider the
[36:51] sleeping murder
[36:52] when they are judged at the judgment
[36:55] well the sleeping virgin will be saved
[36:58] of course
[37:00] she'll be saved at the judgment
[37:04] she'll never be the bride
[37:08] she's just given eternal lives
[37:10] but she has a saved group of people that
[37:12] will come in the judgment that will not
[37:14] be included in the bride but as long as
[37:16] there are virgins that they are before
[37:18] god
[37:19] see they are to be saved he separates
[37:22] there'll be the sheep on his right side
[37:25] and the unsaying will be the goats on
[37:27] his left at the great water on judgment
[37:29] you remember i was quoting jesus while
[37:30] ago in matthew 24
[37:34] 25 excuse me were
[37:37] five would be i mean where they would be
[37:39] sheeps and goats
[37:40] all right who's the sheeps and the goats
[37:42] the foolish virgins will be the sheep
[37:44] because they're as sheep
[37:48] the rest of the world will be the goats
[37:50] man all right now judgment is spoken of
[37:53] throughout the bible in many many ways
[37:56] but i just want to get down to a couple
[37:57] of scriptures go ahead and pull up
[37:59] number four and let's read this one
[38:01] because daniel
[38:02] sees the same thing
[38:05] that john sees in revelation so that's
[38:07] where we're going to be comparing them
[38:08] in a second
[38:11] daniel 7 and 9 says i'll be held till
[38:13] the thrones were cast down and the
[38:15] ancient of days did see it his garment
[38:17] was just white as snow when the hair of
[38:19] his head was like their wool his strong
[38:21] was like the fiery flame in his whip and
[38:23] his wheels that's burning fire a fiery
[38:26] stream issued and came forth from before
[38:28] him thousand
[38:30] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[38:33] no once
[38:35] and conjunction something else and then
[38:38] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[38:41] stood before him
[38:44] i don't know what
[38:47] some ministers some stood before him
[38:49] and the judgment was set and the books
[38:52] were opened
[38:54] now
[38:56] all right
[38:57] so now we're getting down to a point
[38:59] that's where we're going to start
[39:00] comparing
[39:03] the show you brought around verifies it
[39:05] daniel is bill number five and we'll
[39:07] read that one taken from the ten
[39:08] versions 144 000.
[39:11] paragraph 194 12 11 morning service now
[39:15] at the end of the time how many knows
[39:17] that the bible says that the saints
[39:19] shall judge the earth
[39:20] the bible says that see the saints will
[39:22] judge the earth that's why it says don't
[39:23] take no man no no brother to court
[39:26] you don't say not you know for other
[39:28] people don't take a brother to court
[39:30] right why because you're trying to judge
[39:32] things that you should that should
[39:33] be judged in the church
[39:35] they shouldn't be judged by the world
[39:36] right
[39:37] that's all right
[39:39] the things you'll judge the earth
[39:41] he's saying well hey he ain't my brother
[39:43] well
[39:44] you might have a point because you might
[39:46] not be his
[39:48] it may be the other way around
[39:51] see paul said so now let's turn to the
[39:52] book of revelations and get the white
[39:54] throne
[39:55] we could get it out book excuse excuse
[39:57] me let's turn the book of daniel and get
[39:59] the white throne we could get it out of
[40:00] revelation well but i like
[40:04] to take it out of daniel it's the same
[40:06] thing daniel 7 and we'll catch the great
[40:09] white throne judgment here
[40:11] all right now
[40:14] what i want to do is i want him to pull
[40:16] up go ahead and pull up and
[40:21] i want us to just look at these
[40:22] scriptures and compare something
[40:25] now
[40:26] we've proved the point that
[40:29] daniel spoke of the white throne
[40:31] judgment
[40:33] just as
[40:34] john spoke of the white throne jacob
[40:38] now let's compare the two or study the
[40:40] two scriptures
[40:43] and
[40:44] look at it as i was saying to begin with
[40:50] that reading one by itself
[40:54] no matter if you read the revelations
[40:55] account or the daniel account
[40:58] you're not getting the full
[41:00] understanding that you are if you put
[41:02] them both
[41:04] together you with me
[41:07] put them all together i want you to
[41:08] learn learn to read scriptures
[41:12] we read the scriptures
[41:15] just because we believe god sent a
[41:16] prophet that doesn't do away with our
[41:18] bible
[41:19] that turned us back to the bible
[41:21] that brought the bible to be more
[41:23] valuable amen
[41:24] because it began to tell us
[41:29] you know what the word says
[41:32] i'm reading from a
[41:34] scofield bible that's the king james
[41:36] version 1909
[41:42] all right i have the 16 11 editions in
[41:44] my home
[41:46] you don't have a 16-11 edition of a
[41:48] scofield you don't have a 16-11 edition
[41:52] and just very few that you can get a
[41:54] 16-11 which is original king james this
[41:56] is what it's called and you look on the
[41:58] front of your bottom you look on the
[41:59] side of it it says ken james version
[42:02] all right
[42:03] that is not the 1611.
[42:06] and the very very little wording has
[42:08] changed from the 1611 to scofield or
[42:11] world or any of them
[42:14] thompson chain when they brought it on
[42:15] over but it's
[42:16] most of them are printed into the 19
[42:19] coming on up until
[42:21] some bibles have been printed just a few
[42:22] years ago all right
[42:24] but now the point i want you to get is
[42:27] look at what one scripture will say
[42:32] if you're looking at that scripture
[42:33] alone
[42:36] then you won't get a clear understanding
[42:41] all right
[42:42] now i'm just using this from the book of
[42:43] daniel this you know with the book of
[42:45] revelation
[42:47] go in and read your bible
[42:51] and think about other times things are
[42:54] said and turn over and redeem
[42:57] and see that they're not contradictory
[43:01] you have four gospels matthew mark luke
[43:04] and john right
[43:07] written by four different men
[43:09] two of those
[43:10] men luke and mark were not even original
[43:13] disciples when jesus was here
[43:16] right they come on later
[43:18] but when they wrote
[43:20] they wrote a lot of times of different
[43:22] accounts
[43:24] or one will tell
[43:27] of this
[43:28] whereas the other one won't mention it
[43:32] all right then you can go back in there
[43:35] and compare them and get some wonderful
[43:37] studies out of it i ask you to do that
[43:40] sometimes just start out just read a
[43:42] little bit in matthew
[43:44] and then turn over and mark and then
[43:46] turn over to luke and
[43:47] turn over john
[43:50] and look what it's doing is it's
[43:52] clarifying the subject
[43:56] the holy spirit is not just making those
[43:58] people write down verbatim word by word
[44:01] word by word because like i said really
[44:04] matthew mark luke and john were not
[44:05] pinned till somewhere around 80 50.
[44:09] there is a video out now which is very
[44:11] good one
[44:12] that if you want to watch it
[44:14] then it's called the end it's been out a
[44:16] long time but it's called the
[44:17] indestructible bible or the
[44:19] indestructible book
[44:21] and i would ask you to look at it
[44:22] because it really explains a lot of
[44:24] things or that a lot of things came into
[44:26] view
[44:28] but see the bible was not written down
[44:30] go read in your bible look at the thing
[44:32] it was not written down while jesus was
[44:34] doing that because luke and mark was not
[44:36] dire
[44:38] but i love to read the book of luke
[44:39] because luke comes along he's a
[44:41] physician you know a doctor so he's more
[44:44] intellectual
[44:45] but yet being more intellectual he's
[44:47] more precise
[44:49] upon some of his points
[44:52] that maybe mark and luke i mean mark and
[44:54] john and him are
[44:56] john is more prophetic
[44:58] god is a spirit and they that worship
[45:01] him much worship in the spirit and truth
[45:03] he's more prophetic form
[45:05] all right
[45:06] because he then he was chosen to go home
[45:08] to patmos
[45:09] or
[45:10] but see luke says in the beginning of
[45:12] his right he said having perfect
[45:14] understanding
[45:18] now what about a man that was never
[45:19] there to see anything that went on
[45:22] he wasn't there walking with jesus
[45:25] whereas matthew and
[45:28] john were
[45:30] well luke says having perfect
[45:31] understanding but compare matthew mark
[45:34] luke and john
[45:37] and read them and you'll see it's
[45:38] beautiful but yet of course we want to
[45:40] find contradictions
[45:43] because we're smart
[45:45] no it's stupid
[45:47] if there is a god he can't keep his word
[45:50] straight then what kind of a peanut
[45:51] brain
[45:53] who are we
[45:55] to argue about god's word amen
[45:58] well i got it right what gives you that
[46:00] right the constitution or the bible
[46:02] the bible store don't give you a right
[46:03] to think
[46:06] sheep or sheep
[46:08] they bear wolf
[46:12] come on
[46:14] but you see church
[46:16] comparing scripture you get a great
[46:18] understanding but like i said we want to
[46:20] find contradiction so we go in matthew
[46:22] mark luke and john we read and one says
[46:24] there's one blind man the other one says
[46:26] there's two blind man
[46:28] boy look at that look at that look at
[46:30] that
[46:31] boy you're
[46:33] what makes it stupid i don't mean to be
[46:35] wrong in the terminal i use but it is a
[46:37] great word
[46:41] dumb can be helped
[46:43] right
[46:45] and dumb can learn right
[46:47] stupid cane
[46:49] right
[46:51] now watch
[46:53] you say well there's one one blind man
[46:55] and one with two
[46:58] come on it's not a contradiction right
[47:02] that's two men writing
[47:05] and one of them was writing from
[47:06] accounts that other people
[47:08] gave we get the holy spirit using them
[47:11] to write
[47:13] that's what i want you to see
[47:15] that's the point i want to follow you to
[47:17] follow from from this okay thank you
[47:20] brother he's got him on side beside man
[47:22] that's what we're doing with all of this
[47:23] new system that's coming it'll be
[47:25] beautiful because they'll be able to sit
[47:26] in there and look at it and they can
[47:29] uh take their little joystick and just
[47:31] run over here to one run over here to
[47:32] the other one and we also got one that
[47:35] we can look at you
[47:38] there will be three of them
[47:41] if you turn and look up there one day
[47:42] and you see something with
[47:45] you
[47:47] you might or smile
[47:50] it might show up
[47:51] that you're not smiling
[47:53] and it's your discontent
[47:58] but look let's read the two
[48:01] daniel
[48:03] and revelation
[48:05] revelations 20 verse 11 says and i saw a
[48:08] great white drum
[48:10] all right
[48:13] now
[48:15] a great by trump singular
[48:18] okay
[48:20] look what daniel says
[48:23] i'll be held till the thrones
[48:27] were cast down
[48:30] plural
[48:33] is he wrong no
[48:36] because it's only one white drum
[48:39] amen that's right
[48:42] and daniel is saying
[48:44] he be held till the thrones dominions
[48:50] nations
[48:52] peoples
[48:54] were cast down
[48:58] they didn't make a whole lot of drones
[49:02] all the nation is cast out it's only
[49:03] what one throne left and that's god
[49:06] strong
[49:07] right
[49:08] so they're saying the same thing
[49:11] okay
[49:14] now watch
[49:16] revelation says
[49:18] draw what great white throne and him
[49:20] that sat on it
[49:24] from whose face the earth and the heaven
[49:26] fled away
[49:28] and there was found no place for them
[49:31] look what daniel says
[49:33] i'll be held all the thrones were capped
[49:34] down and the ancient of days did sit
[49:38] whose garment was white as snow and his
[49:40] hair as
[49:43] in the hair of his head like pure wool
[49:46] his throne was like the fiery flame
[49:48] singular throne and his wheels was
[49:51] burning fire
[49:52] now they're describing the same one
[49:54] because
[49:55] john comes on down and he saw that they
[49:58] had stand before god so this must be god
[50:00] is speaking of up here
[50:03] and daniel is speaking of an ancient of
[50:05] days
[50:09] now who is that ancient of days
[50:15] not because of being old wouldn't hire
[50:18] me white like wool
[50:21] even in our land a few years ago the
[50:24] judges and some maybe still do
[50:26] within certain nations would open court
[50:29] and everything
[50:30] wearing a robe
[50:33] with a white wig
[50:35] because it was the sign of authority
[50:38] then ain't this ancient of days is
[50:40] almighty god
[50:42] because who else could be described
[50:45] whose garment was white as snow and his
[50:47] hair and the hair of his head like pure
[50:49] wool his throne was like the fiery flame
[50:52] and his wheels was burning fire
[50:54] they're describing the same person
[50:58] both of them is describing almighty god
[51:02] but yet look at it just understand what
[51:04] i'm saying see one of them is this
[51:05] saying a blunt that's all it is and
[51:07] stand before god
[51:10] he doesn't give a description
[51:14] right
[51:17] revelation doesn't give a description of
[51:19] this one
[51:20] he just says it's god
[51:26] but see now comparing the two we get a
[51:28] description
[51:33] comparing the daniel in the revelation
[51:35] we're getting a description of who this
[51:37] is
[51:39] you see what i'm trying to say
[51:42] we're getting a description of the
[51:44] person that's sitting there
[51:47] amen
[51:49] these the ancient of days it's garbage
[51:51] and water you give it a description
[51:52] where if john
[51:54] the holy spirit
[51:55] through john never chose
[52:00] to describe him
[52:03] why because it's over at the end of the
[52:04] book and by then you ought to know who
[52:05] it is
[52:07] forgive me
[52:09] like i say either put cough drop in or
[52:11] quit preaching
[52:15] and i hear the people say
[52:16] quit preaching but
[52:20] now
[52:22] it's just that old cough
[52:24] but now let's go on a little bit
[52:30] john goes over to verse 12.
[52:33] he said i saw the dead
[52:35] small and great
[52:37] stand before god
[52:41] all right
[52:45] he sees the small and the great you know
[52:48] where's everybody no matter how you're
[52:49] not gonna be a multi-billionaire and get
[52:50] bothered to judgment that the money
[52:52] don't count nothing you know
[52:54] you know
[52:55] like the guy that wanted to carry gold
[52:57] in heaven when he died
[52:59] he kept leading this case and he's
[53:01] wanting to die and when he died he
[53:02] wanted to carry gold with him you know
[53:04] so he said okay take it on me
[53:07] he gets up there and peter looks at him
[53:09] and there he comes carrying this gold
[53:11] what are you doing
[53:12] i want to bring this up here with me he
[53:14] said take it on in ain't nothing with
[53:16] payment
[53:18] not payment that payment like you're
[53:21] walking on the streets of gold you know
[53:23] all right
[53:24] now
[53:25] but
[53:26] listen
[53:28] and i saw the dead small and great stand
[53:30] before god
[53:32] now
[53:34] daniel says a fiery stream issued
[53:37] and came forth from before him
[53:41] who the same one we're talking about the
[53:43] god of daniel
[53:44] but look at look at him he says
[53:47] thousand thousands
[53:49] ministered unto him
[53:58] now what if brother gary if you didn't
[54:00] have revelation didn't have daniel to
[54:02] put with revelation
[54:04] where would you have scripture that
[54:05] there'd be a bride sitting on the throne
[54:07] with right
[54:11] are you following me
[54:14] where would you have scriptures
[54:16] but by putting them together
[54:20] to see the same event
[54:24] we see daniel tells you that there's
[54:25] going to be a thousand thousands
[54:29] ministered to him
[54:32] who ministers to you and your home
[54:34] supposed to let's put it that way it
[54:36] ain't right no more but the wife is
[54:38] supposed to minister to us and it's kind
[54:40] of got flip-flopped now and the husband
[54:42] ministers to the wife in all the cases
[54:44] but that's you know
[54:48] but he's supposed to minister into you
[54:50] the wife to the husband
[54:55] so now daniel is giving you a
[54:56] description that is very valuable
[55:02] he's telling you what is over in the
[55:04] book of revelation
[55:09] he's telling you that there's a bride
[55:13] that will minister unto it
[55:18] and there's only one throne it's going
[55:19] to be a big old throne isn't it
[55:22] you say but then wait a minute there's
[55:24] the boss says thrones
[55:26] but just remember we got one domain you
[55:28] didn't get what i said well ago
[55:32] the bible said he saw till the thrones
[55:36] thrones are dominions
[55:40] rulership
[55:46] so now we're seeing daniel as he picks
[55:48] up and gives us a wonderful picture
[55:51] that he's not sitting on the throne by
[55:53] himself
[55:55] his wife is with him
[56:00] you know the only
[56:02] thing in the african jungle or any
[56:04] jungle that's not afraid of the line
[56:08] the male lines there's only one person
[56:10] there that's not afraid of the male mind
[56:12] you know who that is the female
[56:16] right
[56:17] she's the only one that's not afraid of
[56:19] you
[56:23] see because she knows him
[56:25] you know he's not going to hurt her
[56:28] he said well that's casey i'm will not
[56:29] forget it
[56:31] but look what he said
[56:34] thousands and thousands ministered unto
[56:36] him
[56:38] here daniel said he saw the dead small
[56:41] and great stand before god
[56:46] now daniel is showing you that there's
[56:48] more sitting on the throne besides god
[56:50] himself
[56:51] but the bride is sitting there with him
[56:53] to judge but then he goes on
[56:56] and ten thousand times ten thousand
[56:59] stood before him
[57:03] right
[57:05] see now you're getting somebody standing
[57:06] before him to be judged
[57:11] you won't be as bright
[57:14] she sits on the throne with him
[57:17] are you following me
[57:19] i'm going just a little bit more
[57:23] and what does it say in
[57:24] daniel and saw the dead small and great
[57:27] stand before god and the books
[57:30] plural
[57:32] were open
[57:37] and another book was opened
[57:40] which is the book of life
[57:44] now look what you'd lose if you just
[57:46] went with daniel
[57:48] because daniel said all these stands
[57:50] before
[57:51] and said the judgment was set and the
[57:53] books were open that's all he says
[57:58] he doesn't mention the book of life
[58:04] whereas john does
[58:07] i'm trying to get you just go in the
[58:08] bible and look at things
[58:10] and read it
[58:17] 90 of the bible is
[58:19] is self-explanatory
[58:24] if it says in the bible thou shalt not
[58:26] steal
[58:27] i guess my brother promotes that time
[58:29] some guy said something real smart back
[58:31] to him he said well it don't say don't
[58:32] steal chickens
[58:37] so that's not in the bible don't steal
[58:38] chickens until you steal chickens but
[58:40] you can't steal anything else
[58:43] that's how carnal we are in our doings
[58:47] i'm trying to get us to a point of being
[58:49] able to read the bible for ourselves
[58:52] especially this prophet's message
[58:55] do not run off on a deep interest
[58:57] because you got a quote
[59:01] you got a thought you got an idea
[59:05] i want to see it in the bible amen amen
[59:08] you can't put it in the bible i don't
[59:09] give a hoot about your idea that's right
[59:11] right
[59:14] bring it to me in the scriptures and
[59:15] show me amen then it would do away with
[59:18] all this garbage can this so-called
[59:19] around the message right
[59:21] that's right
[59:22] but the people don't want it that way
[59:24] they want a beautiful
[59:30] story but now look
[59:34] john
[59:35] and daniel both speaks of books
[59:41] plural they'll be at the judgment
[59:47] books
[59:50] okay
[59:53] now why would you need books and a
[59:54] judgment
[59:58] so what you do is you go down to the
[59:59] natural corner what you got you got
[1:00:01] people with a whole back of stacks of
[1:00:02] papers you know the prosecuting attorney
[1:00:04] he has not a book that's not laid out
[1:00:07] but it's a whole lot of papers laid on
[1:00:08] there telling you what you're supposed
[1:00:10] to be
[1:00:11] uh what he's gonna try to find you
[1:00:12] guilty of so he's got books
[1:00:15] and what does he do
[1:00:17] he goes out and searches out your
[1:00:19] credibility's your
[1:00:21] your life
[1:00:22] he gets your records from the courthouse
[1:00:24] or whether you've ever been arrested
[1:00:26] before and he compiles books
[1:00:31] right right that's right
[1:00:35] he pulls all the records he can find
[1:00:40] he makes books
[1:00:43] well then when you come up and say well
[1:00:45] just show me where i've done something
[1:00:47] wrong he said hold on just a minute
[1:00:52] it says here that you were caught for
[1:00:55] stealing
[1:00:56] last year and tried in this court and
[1:00:58] sentenced and
[1:01:00] you're on probation
[1:01:03] you can't argue
[1:01:05] why he's got the books right
[1:01:07] that's why daniel in revelations both
[1:01:11] mention the books
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:14] because god keeps a record he doesn't
[1:01:16] have to
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:19] well i don't have to keep a record of
[1:01:21] our lives
[1:01:22] he can call it back to us at any split
[1:01:24] second or moment he wants to
[1:01:27] you remember daniel curry when he was
[1:01:28] talking about it said that you know in
[1:01:31] his dream that he had and it was a good
[1:01:32] point he said when he had to stand
[1:01:34] before the white throne because we know
[1:01:35] it was just a dream
[1:01:37] but he was a saying
[1:01:39] you know i said daniel curry have you
[1:01:41] ever done anything wrong
[1:01:43] he said i thought i've been a good
[1:01:44] person
[1:01:45] he said the dire pool before me was my
[1:01:47] whole life and i saw all the little
[1:01:49] things that i done
[1:01:50] deceiving little things
[1:01:53] you know the bible said it's the little
[1:01:54] foxes
[1:01:55] that spoil the vine
[1:01:58] you know
[1:02:01] they eat the vine they they about to
[1:02:02] behind they kill the lion
[1:02:04] the little foxes that's right let's see
[1:02:06] these books
[1:02:11] the prophet said number one of books is
[1:02:15] one is the book of the sinners
[1:02:20] book of the sinners
[1:02:25] it's not going to be trying to plead a
[1:02:27] case before an amnesia god
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:36] because he's making records
[1:02:39] now let me ask you a question as i'm
[1:02:41] trying to illustrate records and what it
[1:02:43] means by books
[1:02:46] do you think
[1:02:48] that judas carrick
[1:02:51] would be able to plead his case
[1:02:53] at the white throne
[1:03:01] come on
[1:03:02] sure he'd have records there that he was
[1:03:04] a pretty good guy
[1:03:08] right that's right or jesus wouldn't
[1:03:11] have chosen to walk him to be one of the
[1:03:12] twelves he hadn't been off he'd been
[1:03:13] ever asked about a crooked drunk no
[1:03:16] you know and all of the things he
[1:03:17] wouldn't have chosen for that
[1:03:19] murderer sometimes he wouldn't choke he
[1:03:20] didn't choose any of them
[1:03:25] but do you think judas complete his case
[1:03:29] when the bible says about he said he was
[1:03:31] a thief from the beginning
[1:03:34] i think he was probably a pretty good
[1:03:35] guy
[1:03:37] and when he says he was a thief from the
[1:03:39] beginning i don't think he
[1:03:41] outlandishly robbed because he was the
[1:03:43] treasurer remember
[1:03:44] judas was the treasurer he carried the
[1:03:46] money
[1:03:47] i don't think he stole enough out of it
[1:03:49] to build him a home
[1:03:51] you know to buy a new car
[1:03:53] or a new donkey
[1:03:59] he just probably took a little bit once
[1:04:01] a while or something just a small amount
[1:04:05] because the bible said he was a thief in
[1:04:06] the beginning
[1:04:10] and like i said about daniel curry he
[1:04:12] said i never did steal nothing
[1:04:14] you know
[1:04:16] see i can stand here today and say
[1:04:18] i've never stole anything
[1:04:21] no bigger than watermelon
[1:04:27] a couple of kids we used to walk across
[1:04:28] the neighbor's field and get a
[1:04:29] watermelon
[1:04:31] we'll see if i went before the judgment
[1:04:33] god pulled that up before him
[1:04:35] do you understand
[1:04:39] trying to compare what the two seed you
[1:04:41] know what they're talking about
[1:04:45] judas couldn't plead his case because it
[1:04:47] says in here written in this book
[1:04:51] see this is the book of man
[1:04:55] pharaoh is in this book right
[1:04:57] could pharaoh argue at judgment of what
[1:04:59] he'd done against the children of israel
[1:05:03] why because it's recorded
[1:05:05] in the book right amen god as i said
[1:05:07] doesn't have to record he could pull it
[1:05:09] back any time he wanted and run him
[1:05:11] across a
[1:05:12] flat screen in front of you
[1:05:15] but he doesn't do it that way he just
[1:05:17] let us go ahead and he just writes down
[1:05:19] a record
[1:05:21] the children of israel were doing real
[1:05:22] good and then they'd do wrong they were
[1:05:24] sent into judgment right
[1:05:27] do you think they could ever plead the
[1:05:28] case and
[1:05:30] do you remember they tried to say it
[1:05:31] when jesus was standing there
[1:05:33] now what about a bunch of people
[1:05:37] that's why i love the bible like it is
[1:05:40] those pharisees and things standing
[1:05:42] before jesus one day were at that time
[1:05:44] physically in bondage to rome right
[1:05:46] right
[1:05:47] are you with me they were physically
[1:05:49] under the roman conquerorship and being
[1:05:52] killed
[1:05:53] because of who they were
[1:05:56] but when jesus said something to him
[1:05:57] they said
[1:05:59] we were never on the bondage
[1:06:02] the door
[1:06:04] yeah
[1:06:05] well
[1:06:06] i i think i remember when they went down
[1:06:09] to
[1:06:11] egypt and was slaves
[1:06:14] you understand what i'm getting at right
[1:06:17] the bible will meet us in judgment
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:22] because it tells of the things even to
[1:06:23] the day and the hour that we're living
[1:06:28] but could judas plead his case when he
[1:06:30] could read right out of the scriptures
[1:06:31] right to him
[1:06:34] that he
[1:06:36] pointed out jesus
[1:06:41] right right you understand right here
[1:06:44] this is the thing that will be at
[1:06:45] judgment
[1:06:48] forgive me for saying thing but i'm not
[1:06:49] about the bible
[1:06:51] because the bible is a book of life of
[1:06:52] mankind
[1:06:56] if they just look at this book and stay
[1:06:58] with it they'd be all right but they
[1:06:59] won't do it right
[1:07:02] you remember when they were going to
[1:07:03] send a spaceship up and they couldn't
[1:07:05] figure out they lost today
[1:07:08] and they couldn't get their calculations
[1:07:09] running whatsoever
[1:07:11] you said what does a day mean to sending
[1:07:12] a rocket to the moon well you gotta have
[1:07:14] all them stars lined up perfectly
[1:07:15] because you don't you're gonna run into
[1:07:17] one of them
[1:07:19] so they had to have everything so we're
[1:07:20] accurately
[1:07:22] so they said well how can we do it we
[1:07:23] got a day missing you know the story
[1:07:26] the man told him said in the bible
[1:07:29] it spoke of the sun standing still
[1:07:34] and they went back and they checked it
[1:07:35] and it said the sun stood still the
[1:07:37] bible doesn't say the sun still a day
[1:07:39] you know hold exited about a day
[1:07:42] this is this is proof of yours this is
[1:07:45] proof of your governments and the and
[1:07:46] the people
[1:07:47] they're sending these spaceships out
[1:07:49] they proved it
[1:07:51] right so they calculated at that time
[1:07:54] through their time spaces and things and
[1:07:56] they found out that they're like about
[1:07:57] 20 minutes
[1:07:59] having a full 24-hour day
[1:08:04] right
[1:08:05] so what did they do they said the man
[1:08:07] said they said is there anywhere else in
[1:08:08] the bible if some help thrust he said
[1:08:11] well it did say one time that the sun
[1:08:13] went back 20 degrees
[1:08:16] you remember that
[1:08:18] the scripture said well it's easy if we
[1:08:19] go forward but it's a little bad
[1:08:22] they calculate their time and they found
[1:08:24] by the bible the day missing in space
[1:08:29] this is what's going to be at the white
[1:08:31] throne judgment amen that's right
[1:08:34] but i'm going to tell you this way it's
[1:08:36] not going to be a king james version a
[1:08:38] thompson chain or scofield or whatever
[1:08:41] it's going to be a group of people oh my
[1:08:44] god
[1:08:45] that happened right
[1:08:47] that's right
[1:08:49] goodbye
[1:08:52] with elijah
[1:08:57] could you just argue with jesus
[1:09:04] you understand what i'm saying
[1:09:06] see that's that thousands of ten
[1:09:08] thousands is gonna be
[1:09:10] ministering unto it
[1:09:14] the true names of this in this book is
[1:09:15] gonna be there right amen
[1:09:19] but this is the book of the records amen
[1:09:21] right the bible even speaks of the earth
[1:09:24] and it says it where their names were
[1:09:25] not written or
[1:09:27] because they really don't need to keep
[1:09:28] it up with them
[1:09:29] yep that's right
[1:09:32] i just thank god that he showed us the
[1:09:34] truth
[1:09:38] books
[1:09:42] were present
[1:09:45] all right
[1:09:47] but the bible then is explanatory pull
[1:09:49] it back up brother
[1:09:51] revelation
[1:09:56] daniel just says books
[1:09:58] we're open
[1:10:05] revelation says
[1:10:07] and the books were open okay we're still
[1:10:09] in them no
[1:10:11] a record of your life
[1:10:16] if you stand before the white throne
[1:10:17] judgment it won't be that
[1:10:19] you know
[1:10:21] let me just roll your life right out in
[1:10:22] front of you
[1:10:25] and would that be something to
[1:10:28] me to be
[1:10:30] standing before the white throne and
[1:10:36] then god turn around and say uh
[1:10:40] chris
[1:10:42] did you tell this man about me
[1:10:45] he said he never heard of me
[1:10:50] yes i told him
[1:10:52] because he liked my face and walked away
[1:10:57] ain't going to be a court of appeal it's
[1:10:59] going to be blunt
[1:11:01] you understand
[1:11:04] but you see there's something else there
[1:11:05] that the book of revelation covers is
[1:11:07] very wonderful i'll try to get a little
[1:11:09] of it
[1:11:12] revelation says in the books were open
[1:11:15] watch
[1:11:16] and another book
[1:11:17] was open which is the book of life now
[1:11:19] daniel never recorded that
[1:11:23] he just says books
[1:11:26] now watch
[1:11:28] and another book was opened which is the
[1:11:29] book of life
[1:11:32] and the dead were judged out of those
[1:11:34] things which were written in the books
[1:11:38] books right
[1:11:42] according to their works right
[1:11:45] in the books
[1:11:47] a record of our life the bible then is a
[1:11:51] a book to be there
[1:11:52] as a record
[1:12:00] you think they won't have to give an
[1:12:01] account
[1:12:03] he's listening last night i believe it
[1:12:04] was to run around talking about that
[1:12:06] lady that he told her she was healed of
[1:12:08] cancer
[1:12:10] and somebody talked her into going down
[1:12:12] and let them operate because they would
[1:12:13] do a guinea pig operation for him
[1:12:17] and he told her he said you're healed
[1:12:19] that cancer is
[1:12:20] dead she went in and told them that
[1:12:23] before they operated
[1:12:27] they said that cancer is still alive in
[1:12:29] you
[1:12:31] they cut her open shoulder up
[1:12:33] cut her to pieces he said
[1:12:36] killed her
[1:12:38] he said them doctors will answer for
[1:12:41] killing that woman
[1:12:44] you say no they were just right now they
[1:12:46] was experimenting when you're
[1:12:47] experimenting
[1:12:55] judge according to their works
[1:12:58] now right
[1:13:00] so all you could put there is what
[1:13:02] you've done or didn't do right
[1:13:07] you see the bible says even a cup of
[1:13:09] water in my name
[1:13:11] not be forgiven and will not be
[1:13:12] forgotten in this world or the world to
[1:13:14] come
[1:13:16] it also says the blessing the holy ghost
[1:13:17] won't be forgiven in this world or the
[1:13:19] world to come
[1:13:21] a lot of things are written in the book
[1:13:24] what about a cup of water
[1:13:28] what about you just done something good
[1:13:29] for somebody not trying to go to heaven
[1:13:32] by doing it
[1:13:33] no that won't work because that's pretty
[1:13:35] pre-planned
[1:13:36] that's pre-meditating stuff that won't
[1:13:37] do it
[1:13:40] but you just help somebody
[1:13:43] who was it martin is that the one that
[1:13:46] martin was the the
[1:13:48] soldier
[1:13:50] and he saw this beggar
[1:13:52] laying out there and the records of him
[1:13:54] and
[1:13:55] nobody wouldn't help the beggar he was
[1:13:56] freezing to death and
[1:13:58] martin took his coat cloaker what they
[1:14:00] call it the thing they wrapped up in and
[1:14:01] wore you cut it in half and gave a man
[1:14:07] and they laughed and made fun of him
[1:14:09] because he was a soldier with a half of
[1:14:11] a garment
[1:14:13] that night when he laid down
[1:14:18] the lord jesus come to him wrapped in
[1:14:20] that beggar's right hand for garment
[1:14:26] said what you've done to the least
[1:14:27] you've done it unto me right amen
[1:14:29] that's written by records of saint
[1:14:31] martin you can argue with him one of the
[1:14:32] church age messenger
[1:14:36] forget it
[1:14:37] hurry up
[1:14:39] what
[1:14:40] and the sea gave up the dead everything
[1:14:43] which were in it
[1:14:46] you know you know
[1:14:48] i i like to explain things but sometimes
[1:14:50] it's just too hard and too late but see
[1:14:52] that sea gave up the dead which really
[1:14:54] doesn't mean there's people living there
[1:14:56] they might be but maybe people out in
[1:14:58] the ocean today when bubbles living
[1:15:01] but that ain't what it's talking about
[1:15:02] it just means those that died at that
[1:15:04] place are gonna raise from that place
[1:15:06] you know those who were cast in the
[1:15:07] ocean gonna raise from there come on
[1:15:10] and death and hell
[1:15:12] delivered up the dead which were in them
[1:15:15] right right
[1:15:17] now death and hell both were delivered
[1:15:20] up
[1:15:20] right what
[1:15:24] and they were judged every man according
[1:15:26] to their works
[1:15:29] watch them
[1:15:30] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:15:32] lake of fire
[1:15:34] which is the second death that's why we
[1:15:35] don't believe in eternal hell that's
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:38] because if you've got an eternal hell
[1:15:39] where are you going to get somebody to
[1:15:40] put in that you're going to have to put
[1:15:42] god in it because god's the only one's
[1:15:43] got eternal life right
[1:15:45] is that sensible
[1:15:48] does that need a knock on the head to
[1:15:49] very understand it god's the only one
[1:15:51] that's got eternal life you've got an
[1:15:52] eternal hell you have to put god into
[1:15:54] hell amen
[1:15:56] there's no such thing in the bible
[1:15:58] that's a catholic doctrine to try to
[1:15:59] scare you to death and the good old
[1:16:01] baptist one i was there witness that
[1:16:03] enough they get you out there and ding
[1:16:05] on your hell if you don't get
[1:16:06] straightened up now if you don't come to
[1:16:08] the lord you're gonna die and burn in
[1:16:10] hell eternally
[1:16:12] i didn't like it then but i didn't know
[1:16:14] how to argue with him about it
[1:16:17] but show me where you've got an eternal
[1:16:19] hell in the bible i want a scripture
[1:16:23] no it's a catholic doctrine that the
[1:16:25] denominations took and put over
[1:16:28] it's like your post millennials from
[1:16:29] pre-millennials and all of that
[1:16:32] but look
[1:16:34] that's the second death
[1:16:36] the second death is the death of the
[1:16:38] soul
[1:16:40] when you're totally annihilated
[1:16:42] and whosoever was not found written in
[1:16:45] the book of life didn't say books
[1:16:50] was cast into the lake of fire
[1:16:56] if you wasn't found in the book of life
[1:16:58] it didn't say about your books
[1:17:02] you've been found in the book of life
[1:17:07] all right
[1:17:10] so the book of life what is the book of
[1:17:11] life brother dale then
[1:17:16] this bible that's right
[1:17:17] man that's right it's the only book
[1:17:19] that's got any promise of life in it
[1:17:25] it can judge us as books of our deeds
[1:17:31] what was the difference in judas's
[1:17:32] carrot
[1:17:36] and peter
[1:17:41] what do you mean
[1:17:43] betray jesus well
[1:17:45] i remember
[1:17:47] that peter had to be rebuked one time
[1:17:49] and jesus even said get behind me satan
[1:17:51] right
[1:17:52] because he didn't like what was in him
[1:17:55] and peter denied him three times there's
[1:17:57] no record jews ever denied him three
[1:17:59] times he just turned him into the people
[1:18:03] he didn't deny him
[1:18:06] you know what he thought so much of that
[1:18:08] life he'd done he went out and hung
[1:18:10] himself
[1:18:13] but peter runs around glory hallelujah
[1:18:17] but he had denied the lord jesus and
[1:18:19] even cursed
[1:18:21] that doesn't mean he used naturally
[1:18:22] vulgar words
[1:18:24] the curse means to light the esteem
[1:18:27] it doesn't mean you use these big long
[1:18:29] blank words that you black out
[1:18:32] that's just a plain old center
[1:18:35] but a person that claims with that bible
[1:18:37] don't mean that
[1:18:39] who are you to tell us what the bible
[1:18:40] says i'm not telling you i'll just tell
[1:18:43] you what it's saying it's up to you to
[1:18:44] decide whether it's right or not amen
[1:18:47] right
[1:18:49] but this bible is a book of life amen
[1:18:53] but you know what it's also
[1:18:54] it's also called the lounge book of life
[1:18:59] or correctly placing the book of the
[1:19:00] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:19:02] world
[1:19:08] this is it's a book
[1:19:10] what a wonderful piece
[1:19:12] of material right right
[1:19:18] it will be there and our names will be
[1:19:20] written now you won't find samuel there
[1:19:22] written in anywhere in here you find
[1:19:24] samuel that don't work too good
[1:19:26] he's old testament
[1:19:31] that's why i love the book of
[1:19:32] revelations
[1:19:34] because the book of revelations read
[1:19:36] chapter two and three especially
[1:19:38] it gives you seven church ages
[1:19:43] and the last one is the lady of cnn age
[1:19:45] right
[1:19:46] and ladies simply people's rights right
[1:19:50] and look around you've never seen a time
[1:19:52] when it was people's rights and that's
[1:19:54] not just saying to black people come on
[1:19:58] everybody now people's rights
[1:20:03] i have my right
[1:20:07] then you get into the religious room
[1:20:08] well i got right believe what i want to
[1:20:10] the constitution gives you that all
[1:20:12] right the bible don't do it right i want
[1:20:14] to see that in the bible right but
[1:20:17] you've got a right to believe what you
[1:20:18] want to believe come on i want to see it
[1:20:20] in here
[1:20:26] it says unless you believe that i am he
[1:20:28] you will die in your sins that's what
[1:20:30] this book
[1:20:34] this book then is the book of life
[1:20:38] you see your name is not in there my
[1:20:40] name is not in there no
[1:20:46] but if i can find what's going on in the
[1:20:47] day that i'm living right
[1:20:49] wouldn't that be my name in the book
[1:20:51] yeah come on
[1:20:52] come on
[1:20:55] the bible's written in funny ways
[1:21:02] see what was the brother hamptons used
[1:21:03] to use
[1:21:05] paul it says there in the scripture one
[1:21:07] time said paul come out to minister and
[1:21:09] said the whole town came out to see
[1:21:12] you you analyze that just a little bit
[1:21:14] you know
[1:21:17] the whole town came out it was the cars
[1:21:19] the buildings the stores the homes the
[1:21:22] streets
[1:21:26] that's not what it's saying right right
[1:21:29] right
[1:21:30] it's talking about
[1:21:32] people right right
[1:21:35] this bible is written about people right
[1:21:39] but it's written about you amen
[1:21:44] daniel said that they would be
[1:21:47] thousands thousands ministering to him
[1:21:52] that puts their name in the book sister
[1:21:54] gail you don't have to look around try
[1:21:57] to find your name and find it under
[1:21:58] secret codes you can take a letter over
[1:22:00] here a letter over here and put it over
[1:22:02] here and you come out with your name
[1:22:04] hallelujah
[1:22:07] right
[1:22:11] but you see church what i'm trying to
[1:22:12] get you to see
[1:22:15] comparing the scriptures
[1:22:19] and seeing what it's talking about
[1:22:25] books
[1:22:27] or natural life
[1:22:29] the book of life
[1:22:36] where are these books at
[1:22:39] this bible is this record of life that
[1:22:41] was written before the foundation of the
[1:22:43] world
[1:22:48] we are told in the bible to what
[1:22:50] you attempt of our earnings that truth
[1:22:54] did god just make that up
[1:22:57] we really ought to give him 90 and keep
[1:22:59] 10 but that's
[1:23:01] he didn't say that
[1:23:06] he said you tie the mint and roll
[1:23:07] talking to the pharisees and said you
[1:23:09] leave the other things undone well
[1:23:10] that's that's that doesn't do you any
[1:23:12] good then you just spent your money
[1:23:16] but where did the bible get that
[1:23:22] when did abraham that was coming back
[1:23:24] from the slaughter of the kings
[1:23:26] he met melchizedek right
[1:23:30] which was almighty gone
[1:23:34] and he said i'll give you a tenth of
[1:23:36] what everything i'm
[1:23:37] all right
[1:23:42] well
[1:23:45] that's just talking about that one
[1:23:48] see this book's got the answer to all
[1:23:50] things
[1:23:51] because it is the book of life but it's
[1:23:53] the lamb's book of life for the record
[1:23:55] of the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:02] paul saying to the church at ephesus
[1:24:04] he went right into the world
[1:24:09] those that are in christ jesus he said
[1:24:14] the bible's written about the world
[1:24:16] contains the many things contains the
[1:24:18] book of life
[1:24:22] it also contains the lounge book of life
[1:24:24] right
[1:24:27] in one beautiful book
[1:24:33] ended up daniel said i said it says that
[1:24:35] there was
[1:24:37] thousands of thousands ministered into
[1:24:40] it
[1:24:42] john never wrote it anyway
[1:24:48] because see he had already written about
[1:24:50] the millennium
[1:24:54] truth 19th chapter
[1:24:57] we're in the 20th chapter he doesn't
[1:24:58] talk about the millennium and then
[1:25:00] starting into the to the uh chapter 20
[1:25:03] it's the first few verses is talking
[1:25:05] about the millennium in the first
[1:25:06] resurrection
[1:25:08] see he didn't have to put in there that
[1:25:10] they would
[1:25:11] be
[1:25:12] many sitting with him
[1:25:15] because he'd already told the story
[1:25:19] of the bride coming forth
[1:25:21] and riding into the millennial rain
[1:25:24] rolling and reigning with them for a
[1:25:26] thousand years
[1:25:30] look at one and see the other
[1:25:33] john tells you one thing
[1:25:36] daniel tells you another
[1:25:39] put them together you've got a beautiful
[1:25:40] picture
[1:25:42] of the story of redemption
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:47] now we can read for ourselves
[1:25:53] see we believe god sent a prophet
[1:25:56] but we just don't go around here
[1:25:59] trying to make him god because he wasn't
[1:26:04] if i'd have been back in the days of
[1:26:05] martin luther i would have been glad to
[1:26:07] have protested the catholic church with
[1:26:09] you
[1:26:13] i would have been following what luther
[1:26:14] said because i followed today
[1:26:16] but luther taught the judge shall live
[1:26:18] by faith
[1:26:21] that's exactly right
[1:26:23] we don't reject any church teachings
[1:26:26] that's correct right amen
[1:26:28] the methodists teach sanctification i
[1:26:30] firmly believe in sanctification
[1:26:34] the pentecostals
[1:26:36] association street 1906 coming forth
[1:26:39] with the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:26:41] gifts and signs and wonder i believe in
[1:26:43] that
[1:26:44] i believe the baptist is writing what
[1:26:45] they were saying they brought back to us
[1:26:48] immersion into the water
[1:26:51] because the word baptizo means to go
[1:26:53] down and come back up so they brought it
[1:26:54] back and restored it to the church
[1:26:57] each one of those churches had a uh
[1:27:00] a word for the hour
[1:27:02] right amen you know what the world's
[1:27:04] going to be judged by them
[1:27:06] the people of that day will be judged by
[1:27:08] what they taught in that day
[1:27:14] he said well you mean they'll be they'll
[1:27:16] be judged by what martin luther taught
[1:27:22] of the truth
[1:27:23] amen
[1:27:25] we just want to continue on
[1:27:28] keep on going
[1:27:30] until we leave the world
[1:27:33] when we leave the world
[1:27:36] see we can say the journey's finished
[1:27:41] we don't have to go to the great latron
[1:27:43] judgment to be judged whether or not
[1:27:45] we're going to heaven
[1:27:49] show me that in the bible anywhere
[1:27:52] but it's been taught by mankind
[1:27:55] those things are what i don't agree with
[1:27:59] those doctrinal ideas is what i don't
[1:28:01] agree with
[1:28:02] martin luther said
[1:28:05] that the jews were antichrists in order
[1:28:06] to be killed
[1:28:09] i don't go along with that
[1:28:12] but you know if he was here today he
[1:28:14] wouldn't go along with it either
[1:28:18] if he just thought about what he was
[1:28:19] saying he wouldn't went along with it
[1:28:20] then
[1:28:25] did you see the truth went up amen
[1:28:29] didn't jesus say you shall know the
[1:28:31] truth
[1:28:33] and the truth shall set you free in that
[1:28:35] scripture
[1:28:39] he said i am the way
[1:28:41] the truth and the life
[1:28:44] that's all i want
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:49] i want what he had
[1:28:54] i'm trying to make something out of
[1:28:55] anything that's no problem anyway but
[1:28:57] what is it any need of trying to make
[1:28:59] something out of something
[1:29:01] you know out of yourself
[1:29:03] as i said they're doing that in here
[1:29:06] that's what they've done in cyprus
[1:29:07] whether they close your money out before
[1:29:08] you got home
[1:29:11] it can't happen here in america
[1:29:13] i will remind you they have a great
[1:29:16] depression
[1:29:18] that
[1:29:19] took a lot of people down
[1:29:21] and i will remind you that the economy
[1:29:23] has fallen many times more
[1:29:26] points than what they fell into
[1:29:28] depression
[1:29:30] we just wouldn't time yet
[1:29:36] but you see comparing scriptures we see
[1:29:38] today we're living
[1:29:40] then we're not just isolating one
[1:29:41] scripture and reading it
[1:29:44] we're taking an overall view of the
[1:29:46] entire bible to bring it together to
[1:29:48] show us a beautiful picture
[1:29:50] of the plan of redemption come on
[1:29:52] brothers
[1:29:53] the plan of redemption
[1:29:58] the book of revelation shows you the
[1:29:59] plan of redemption
[1:30:02] all the way from the beginning clean to
[1:30:04] the ending
[1:30:11] compare scripture
[1:30:14] take the prophet's message then and
[1:30:15] compare what he would say
[1:30:21] with things that you think he said wrong
[1:30:25] but just give it a little while and
[1:30:26] you'll find out he couldn't say it no
[1:30:27] other way
[1:30:36] but we can argue all we want to that
[1:30:38] won't help nothing
[1:30:41] it won't change the thing
[1:30:47] to truthfully understand
[1:30:50] your own judgment we don't have to go
[1:30:52] there
[1:30:55] if we're saved
[1:30:57] if not that's where we're headed no
[1:30:58] matter how religious we think we are how
[1:31:01] much money we think we've given how much
[1:31:03] of our time do we think we've given
[1:31:06] now you think about that scripture as
[1:31:08] quoting a while ago when they come to
[1:31:09] him and say didn't i cast out devils in
[1:31:11] thy name and done mighty wonderful works
[1:31:15] he never argued with him at all he
[1:31:16] didn't say they didn't do it
[1:31:18] he was agreeing with him
[1:31:23] but he said you never i never knew you i
[1:31:25] never had an experience
[1:31:27] a relationship with you to be my wife
[1:31:32] spiritually speaking
[1:31:36] we don't have to go there
[1:31:38] if we don't want to
[1:31:41] but if we don't get born again we're
[1:31:43] going to the restaurant
[1:31:48] and i hope you understand what i talk
[1:31:49] about books
[1:31:51] book of life lounge book of life
[1:31:55] all right here in this one bible
[1:31:58] anything you need to know is right here
[1:32:04] as i said they even found that day
[1:32:05] missing in space by reading the bible
[1:32:11] they say the psalms is written in
[1:32:12] certain ways that they tried to break
[1:32:14] the codes
[1:32:15] that they can learn about certain people
[1:32:17] would be killed and certain people did
[1:32:19] i'm not worried about that because i
[1:32:20] don't worry about the codes
[1:32:22] i'm talking about the god or the word
[1:32:31] anybody
[1:33:00] oh
[1:33:12] i know
[1:33:25] uh
[1:33:42] all right
[1:33:51] hello
[1:34:05] okay
[1:34:44] just leaves me
[1:35:12] you know
[1:35:27] i can't argue the point because he's
[1:35:29] gone
[1:35:31] but just what if he does it
[1:35:36] you know it could be god's
[1:35:41] and let's belief join together
[1:36:04] do not change
[1:36:22] is
[1:36:51] here i am
[1:37:26] is
[1:37:34] i know
[1:37:48] until someday
[1:38:03] the racial candidate was telling this
[1:38:05] other day it reminded us of
[1:38:07] probably over 30 years ago
[1:38:12] brother collins is
[1:38:17] the girl
[1:38:18] had a baby
[1:38:20] and it's all this organs were basically
[1:38:23] outside
[1:38:25] after she told it
[1:38:27] we remembered you know when we were all
[1:38:29] praying
[1:38:31] and just with no hopes
[1:38:36] but you know what
[1:38:39] that kid's walked down
[1:38:41] 18
[1:38:42] 18 years old
[1:38:46] it learned to crawl
[1:38:50] this went into its bladder
[1:38:53] kidneys and something was outside of the
[1:38:55] body
[1:38:57] still
[1:38:59] learn to scoot along the floor
[1:39:03] they had to put stuff around it to hold
[1:39:06] it you know
[1:39:07] work and move and do it
[1:39:09] but today
[1:39:11] the child's living
[1:39:15] see that's in our day that's not to say
[1:39:17] in this and after the other
[1:39:21] seemed too many to not believe
[1:39:32] i'd be an unbeliever i've got too much
[1:39:33] testimony in myself how many times he's
[1:39:35] healed me
[1:39:37] i'm not talking about little things i'm
[1:39:38] a major thing
[1:39:40] changing my blood type totally from a
[1:39:43] positive a negative medically proven
[1:39:47] by their own records
[1:39:49] that they took the blood
[1:39:52] both times
[1:39:55] see it's nothing impossible with god if
[1:39:57] you believe that's right
[1:40:00] okay
[1:40:01] yeah located a picture up here
[1:40:04] and leukemia the kind that'll kill you
[1:40:09] now she's one twenty twenty couple weeks
[1:40:11] ago
[1:40:12] no problem
[1:40:15] what about that amen hallelujah but why
[1:40:18] can't we believe
[1:40:22] you see
[1:40:23] the prophet said it one day he said it
[1:40:25] would be sin to disbelieve now
[1:40:27] what were the things that we have
[1:40:29] witnessed among ourselves to see
[1:40:32] of the sick healed the dead raised
[1:40:37] that we don't have to brag about it's
[1:40:38] the truth we've got to have it
[1:40:40] documented if needed
[1:40:45] see god is real
[1:40:47] all he wants us to do is just believe it
[1:40:50] that's it
[1:40:52] just believe him he'll take care of him
[1:40:54] i didn't ask him to change my blood type
[1:40:57] i didn't ask him a thing about it
[1:40:59] he done it on his own
[1:41:02] he said that's medically impossible i
[1:41:03] agree with you but you want the records
[1:41:05] come on
[1:41:07] where they took the medic took the blood
[1:41:09] and then they had to go back and take it
[1:41:10] they proved it
[1:41:12] it's a negative now
[1:41:18] about it
[1:41:19] i mean
[1:41:21] this book is right
[1:41:24] it's the book of the center
[1:41:26] it's the book of life
[1:41:29] but it's the lounge book of life
[1:41:33] and the bride is that lounge book of
[1:41:35] life made manifest
