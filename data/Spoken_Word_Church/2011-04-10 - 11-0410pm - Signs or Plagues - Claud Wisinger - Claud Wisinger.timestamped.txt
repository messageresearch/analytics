[6:55] presence I shall
[6:58] stand amen amen you come H
[7:04] now amen
[7:18] amen I'd like to give a little testimony
[7:21] before I sing I was so sick downstairs
[7:23] long ago two of the sisters laid hands
[7:26] on me and prayed for me and before I got
[7:28] seated that was gone
[7:30] so thankful thank you so now if the rest
[7:33] of you would just pray that I have a
[7:36] voice I've just about quit singing and I
[7:39] I mean we got so many good singers in
[7:41] this church so I just don't sing out
[7:43] much anymore and I just appreciate it if
[7:46] youd pray for me because if you don't
[7:48] use it you lose it and that's the truth
[7:49] that's right um how many of you remember
[7:53] when you were saved when you accepted
[7:55] Christ in your lives amen I was sitting
[7:58] over there and I was thinking a few
[7:59] minutes ago my mom and dad used to have
[8:02] a quartet and I've been drugging every
[8:04] Baptist Church on the other side of
[8:05] Atlanta since I was just a little bitty
[8:08] thing and they used to sit my sister and
[8:10] myself up on a piano stool and we would
[8:12] do Duets and then their quartet would
[8:14] sing and that's where I learned the love
[8:17] of God in music and then one night mom
[8:20] and dad were off someplace and I was
[8:23] just probably about 9 years no I was 12
[8:26] and the church I went to the Baptist
[8:28] Church was right across the street so I
[8:30] just walked over there by myself you
[8:32] know and that night the Lord came into
[8:35] my heart he touched my soul and I
[8:38] remember all of a sudden I just bursted
[8:40] out to crying and just that wonderful
[8:43] feeling of everything you know what you
[8:46] felt like when you accepted Christ and
[8:48] as years have gone on I'm 72 years I'm
[8:51] 72 years old now excuse me and I have
[8:56] seen so much I really never got into
[8:58] very much I mean when you accept the
[9:00] Lord at 12 you don't get into a whole
[9:02] lot through your teenager years some
[9:04] maybe some things but nothing really bad
[9:07] and I got to thinking you know we've
[9:09] tried a lot of things you try the love
[9:11] of a man the love of a woman the love of
[9:14] your children uh the love of the world
[9:17] the love of everything on Earth but this
[9:20] song is it touches my heart and it's
[9:22] page
[9:24] 327 in the spile book and sing with me
[9:27] and it's in key of D I think
[9:30] and I'm going to start with A Chorus and
[9:32] then I'll go with the verses but this is
[9:34] the song of my heart only Jesus can
[9:36] satisfy
[9:38] yourself

[16:07] what I said this morning that's what
[16:09] every man woman whoever you are if
[16:11] you're a Christian you always want to
[16:12] see God is that right that's why we've
[16:15] came here to this afternoon is to see
[16:17] him hear from him uh I appreciate it
[16:20] you're always a a very good congregation
[16:22] to preach to like I've said when people
[16:24] are well taught it's not hard to
[16:26] minister to that congregation at all
[16:29] uh so I just want to tell brother Samuel
[16:32] thank you uh he's been a real blessing
[16:34] to me and uh brother Wade also I enjoy
[16:37] getting brother Wade out you know
[16:39] brother Wade he tells me one thing and
[16:41] he gripes when I do it you know because
[16:44] uh when I was work I retired February
[16:46] the 25th I I've been with an oil company
[16:48] for 34 years and was able to retire but
[16:51] uh you know he always grapped at me
[16:53] while I was preaching and working I
[16:55] invite a visiting preacher every two
[16:56] weeks well he said well you need to do
[16:57] more preaching
[16:59] and so you know I've tried to do that in
[17:01] the last year even though I was still
[17:03] working do more preaching and every time
[17:05] I comes he grabs at me says well you
[17:06] don't have me out very
[17:08] often it's like you know this guy can
[17:11] confuse me so bad sometimes but you know
[17:14] you're the one that told me to do more
[17:15] preaching so now I'm doing more
[17:17] preaching and it kind of cuts him out of
[17:19] the picture right then he grabs cuz I
[17:21] don't invite him more so I was going to
[17:22] let him know it's not my fault I mean I
[17:25] just was doing what he told me to do
[17:27] okay so that's kind of way it works for
[17:29] us sometimes don't it but I I really
[17:31] enjoy ministering here and and uh the
[17:35] Lord has really blessed me the last four
[17:36] years that's right um and not to leave
[17:39] you standing I'm sorry but actually uh I
[17:41] said as a deacon in a church with
[17:43] brother Jess for 20 years uh 25 or 26
[17:47] years ago I was in a charismatic church
[17:49] and a lady actually prophesied over me
[17:51] and said and she didn't know I was
[17:52] fasting at that time and asking God for
[17:55] more obedience she and she came and she
[17:57] prophesied over she said well you're
[17:58] you're walking obedient This Night in
[18:00] Heaven before God and she said and
[18:02] you're called into the ministry well me
[18:04] and my wife we got in the truck and and
[18:06] I told her I said I looked at her I said
[18:08] well she was half right because you just
[18:10] when you're a minister you fight it do
[18:12] you understand what I'm saying it's the
[18:13] last thing uh you know no preacher feels
[18:16] like they do a good job every service
[18:18] I've ever preached people would tell you
[18:20] and I joke with the people at home I
[18:21] said sometimes I go back out the back
[18:23] door and people Pat me on back say I
[18:25] really enjoyed that in my mind I say
[18:27] were they in the same Serv I was because
[18:30] as a preacher you never feel like you do
[18:31] a good job or you you you study and you
[18:34] have these wonderful quotes and you
[18:36] never seem to cover all the quotes you
[18:38] know what I mean but the thing about a
[18:40] pastor is I always tell people I got
[18:42] three shots at them a week so I don't
[18:44] have to get in a hurry when you're a
[18:46] pastor you don't have to get in a hurry
[18:48] I can just kind of take my time and
[18:50] preach and really get it out there to
[18:51] the people so they can comprehend it and
[18:54] uh it's just been a blessing what L
[18:56] God's done in my life I never pictured
[18:58] myself as a pastor like I say I ran from
[19:00] it my entire life but now that I finally
[19:03] actually accepted the call that God gave
[19:05] me the last four years it's been a
[19:07] blessing it's been a blessing to the
[19:08] church I've seen people really move up
[19:11] and be blessed by it and that like I say
[19:13] it just Thrills my heart it really does
[19:15] and and to see what God's doing in this
[19:17] end time and and for me to be just a
[19:18] small part of it it's just a it's a
[19:21] blessing so as I've said I believe I
[19:24] understand Grace because I am misg Grace
[19:26] you know what I'm saying I really am I
[19:28] have that winning band of Grace I'm that
[19:31] elected lady and I appreciate that so
[19:34] you've been a good audience I hope I
[19:35] didn't confuse anybody with this morning
[19:37] I didn't want to come across as a mad
[19:39] scientist cuz some people probably would
[19:41] think I was and that's not what I wanted
[19:43] to do but I just wanted to show you how
[19:45] God announces it in the heavens and then
[19:48] he does it on Earth is what he does God
[19:50] said it that way in Genesis and he's
[19:52] proved it to us again in this end time
[19:54] that he's still the same yesterday today
[19:56] and forever right and I've told the
[19:58] church the most most anointed preaching
[20:00] that I could do is when I preach current
[20:03] conditions because see he's he's a Jesus
[20:06] of today and if I can't if I preach you
[20:08] a historical God of 2,000 years ago then
[20:11] I feel like as a minister I haven't done
[20:13] my job I've got to bring him present
[20:16] I've got to bring him right here the
[20:17] people is what we have to do so brother
[20:19] brandom even preached modern events made
[20:22] clear by prophecy so your Prophet
[20:24] brought Jesus Christ on the scene is
[20:26] what he did and your should bring Jesus
[20:29] Christ real in this congregation is that
[20:32] right so that's what the true Ministry I
[20:34] believe in this hour will do they'll
[20:35] bring Jesus into the congregation is
[20:38] what they'll do and we know that's the
[20:39] son of man so that's it's just a
[20:41] wonderful subject the son of man I enjoy
[20:44] preaching on it and I think it's a very
[20:46] if you preach on the son of man I
[20:47] promise you be a very anointed service
[20:49] that you preach it really is so God
[20:52] bless you and I appreciate you for
[20:53] having me and brother Samuel and uh you
[20:57] know I I tell the church anymore after I
[20:59] Minister I can't hardly let them go
[21:01] because there's such an anointing that
[21:02] comes down in the congregation it's such
[21:04] a presence of God there that you really
[21:07] don't want to leave it and there's going
[21:08] to come a time where we won't have to
[21:10] leave each other we're going to spend
[21:11] we're just going to spend eternity with
[21:13] one another and it's going to be an
[21:15] awesome awesome time it really is so I
[21:17] want to say thank you uh from the depths
[21:19] of my heart the way you you always treat
[21:21] me well here uh it's just a it's just a
[21:24] great place to be and I think you're a
[21:26] blessed people by having brother Samuel
[21:28] is your pastor and when I see the people
[21:31] I mean you know brother R said you want
[21:32] to understand a minister look at his
[21:34] wife I don't think he was necessarily
[21:35] talking about sister Peggy when he said
[21:37] that but you're good okay I'm not to
[21:41] sister Peggy man smart guy right I do
[21:44] love sister Peggy she's a bit a blessing
[21:46] to me just like brother Samuel but
[21:49] you're he's your husband spiritually
[21:51] speaking of the congregation so when I
[21:53] look out there and I look at you you're
[21:55] the results or you're the fruit of this
[21:57] man's ministri what you are so I know he
[21:59] I know he's a very fine Minister cuz why
[22:02] I can look at the congregation and I can
[22:04] see your living Epistles written R of
[22:06] all men so Lord bless you and I
[22:08] appreciate each and every one of you so
[22:10] I want to go and I want to title this to
[22:12] this tonight if I would it's a little
[22:13] different maybe you think or whatever
[22:15] but I want to call it
[22:17] signs or
[22:19] plagues signs plural or plagues if you
[22:23] remember this morning I preached on the
[22:25] sign of his coming right but we have
[22:27] signs all around us do you know that if
[22:29] you go read the messages in 1964 brother
[22:32] Brandon is almost totally talking about
[22:34] signs did you know that sign after sign
[22:37] after sign is what he's talking to us
[22:39] about so that's what I want to talk
[22:41] about it's either
[22:43] signs or plagues yeah one of the others
[22:46] just like I said in the six seal it's
[22:48] either redemption or judgment does
[22:50] everybody understand that so I just want
[22:52] to read some scriptures okay let's go to
[22:55] Exodus 4
[22:56] and9 Exodus 4:9 this is God talking to
[23:00] Moses
[23:20] okay and it shall come to pass if they
[23:22] will not believe also these two signs
[23:26] neither hearken unto thy voice that thou
[23:28] shalt take of the water of the river and
[23:32] that thou shalt take of the water of the
[23:34] river and pour it upon the dry land and
[23:37] the water which thou takest out of the
[23:39] river shall become blood upon the dry
[23:41] land now I'm going to go to Exodus 4:17
[23:44] okay I'm going to bounce around a bit I
[23:46] apologize for that but it'd be just way
[23:48] a lot of scripture reading if I didn't
[23:50] Exodus 4 and thou shalt take this rod in
[23:54] thine hand wherewith Thou shalt do signs
[23:57] right yeah plural right Exodus 4:30 and
[24:01] Aaron spake all the words which the Lord
[24:03] had spoken unto Moses and did the signs
[24:05] in the sight of the people right right
[24:08] okay now in Exodus
[24:09] 9:13 and the Lord said unto Moses now
[24:12] the The Exodus 49 417 430 he was dealing
[24:16] with the children of Israel so he show
[24:18] the children of Israel he was showing
[24:19] them signs does everybody agree with
[24:21] that right it was signs that he was
[24:23] showing to the children of Israel now
[24:25] we're going to talk to where he's
[24:26] talking to pharaoh and the Lord said
[24:28] unto Moses rise up early in the morning
[24:30] and stand before pharaoh and say unto
[24:33] him thus sayith the Lord God of the
[24:35] Hebrews let my people go and that they
[24:38] may serve me for I will at this time
[24:41] send all my
[24:44] plagues so it's not signs to the
[24:46] Egyptians it's plagues does everybody
[24:48] understand that send all my plagues upon
[24:51] thine heart and upon thy servants and
[24:54] upon thy people and that thou mayest
[24:56] know that there is none like me in all
[24:58] the Earth amen okay I want to read
[25:01] another scripture here this may not
[25:03] sound like it's the same but I'll try to
[25:04] bring it together can I do that Hebrews
[25:11] 12:6 for whom the Lord loveth he
[25:14] chasteneth right and scourgeth every son
[25:18] whom he receiveth you know brother
[25:20] random a lot of times in the message
[25:21] says if you when you become a a
[25:24] Christian that God tries you sure you
[25:26] know God has every right to try you as a
[25:29] son or daughter of God the scripture
[25:31] says don't you never try
[25:33] God did you know that see you don't try
[25:36] God if God says it it'll be just like
[25:38] God says so don't you try him but God
[25:42] has a right to try you and why he tries
[25:44] you he's going to see if you're going to
[25:45] keep his word right that's what the
[25:48] trials are for that's why God tries you
[25:50] to see if your faith is going to hold is
[25:53] that right you I don't care who you are
[25:55] if you're a Christian here and you are
[25:57] you're all are a Time tested Memorial is
[26:00] what you are you are a - tested church
[26:03] is what you are is that right and God
[26:06] will send things your way to test you
[26:09] and to prove you just like he did with
[26:11] job he didn't do that to curse job is
[26:14] that right job's wife said why don't you
[26:17] just curse job and just die but he
[26:20] couldn't do it right because job knew
[26:22] that he was a Son of God and he was
[26:25] being tried of God and he kept his facei
[26:27] is that right that's what we're supposed
[26:29] to do too let's bow our heads dear
[26:31] heavenly father we thank you for the
[26:32] reading of your word we pray that you'll
[26:34] Quicken it to us Lord help me oh Father

[26:40] the hearts of this people Lord I pray
[26:41] that truly Lord that they'll open their
[26:43] heart like I said you're not looking for
[26:45] a red carpet you're looking for an open
[26:47] heart if they want to do something for
[26:49] you they need to open their hearts oh
[26:51] father and I pray they will Lord and may
[26:53] you speak to them this morning in Jesus
[26:55] Christ's name we ask it amen you may be
[26:59] seated just to give you the definition
[27:01] here a plague is an Affliction or
[27:05] Calamity sudden destruction an epidemic
[27:08] or evil did you know that's what a a
[27:11] plague is an Affliction or clamity
[27:14] sudden destruction epidemic or evil is
[27:17] what it is
[27:19] okay and a sign a sign is a signal and
[27:24] for example like when you guys were
[27:25] coming to church today there were signs
[27:27] all up down the road right yeah well you
[27:29] you think man just hatched that up on
[27:31] their
[27:31] own no God's the same way what's he
[27:34] going to do we're on a journey home and
[27:37] God's going to put constant signs up
[27:40] along the way to to Signal you to let
[27:43] you know where you're at in a journey if
[27:45] there's a big turn coming right God's
[27:49] going to allow us to make that turn he's
[27:50] got to put a sign there it goes like
[27:52] that I don't know about you but when I
[27:54] see when I'm going down the road and I
[27:55] see that sign that's got little like
[27:56] that I slow down yeah amen is that right
[27:59] so God absolutely gives you Signs Now I
[28:02] told you this morning about the sign of
[28:04] his coming there was one sign that was
[28:07] given for his coming is that right but
[28:09] for the journey that we're on you got to
[28:12] understand there's many signs that God
[28:14] places out you there to get you where
[28:16] you'll get home safely is that right now
[28:19] do you know in a in in the natural the
[28:22] average uh mishaps or the average wrecks
[28:26] that happen or within 5 miles of your
[28:28] home exactly does everybody know that
[28:30] amen do you does everybody notice here
[28:32] lately how many preachers are falling in
[28:34] the message of the hour how many I mean
[28:37] you you hear a preach and it just it
[28:38] baffles your mind doesn't it well go
[28:41] back to what I said it's it's when you
[28:43] see these things happening it's a sign
[28:45] it's letting you know we're getting
[28:47] close to home is what it is okay so when
[28:49] you see people have set in a church for
[28:51] 30 and 40 years and you never thought
[28:53] they would ever fall out of church and
[28:55] you see them falling out what is it it's
[28:57] a sign that we're at the very end of the
[28:59] journey is everybody okay with that but
[29:01] the only way you can fall is if you just
[29:04] disregard the signs that God has given
[29:06] in this end time is that right remember
[29:08] the Scripture it says the blind will
[29:10] lead the blind they'll both fall in the
[29:12] ditch well what happens if you don't pay
[29:14] attention to the signs that are out
[29:15] there on the highway if it says 45 and
[29:18] you're doing 70 right odds are you're
[29:21] going to end up in the ditch is that
[29:22] right well it's the same way with the
[29:24] message of the hour God has G us signs
[29:27] and we're supposed to absolutely pay
[29:29] attention to those signs that's right is
[29:31] that right we're not an ignorant people
[29:33] at all we know what's going on when you
[29:35] look out there in the world and things
[29:37] this shouldn't baffle you none of these
[29:39] things should ba just like the the the
[29:42] earthquake that happened at Tokyo you
[29:44] know I told the church I said I said go
[29:47] read it under the six seal he said there
[29:49] would be earthquakes that would take
[29:51] every island out of its place do you
[29:53] know Tokyo is 13 ft closer to California
[29:56] now what is it it's just a little
[29:58] preview a little sign for you to tell
[30:00] you where you're at in your journey
[30:03] we're at the end of the end now and
[30:05] that's what I tell our church and I'm
[30:07] not guessing when I say that I see the
[30:09] signs that have been given to us and I
[30:12] understand we're at the very end of this
[30:14] thing so if you're out there playing
[30:16] around and goofing off and thinking oh
[30:19] one day you're going to get yourself
[30:20] right with god brother vom said there's
[30:22] going to be a lot of people that God's
[30:24] going to say it's too late you clowned
[30:27] around
[30:28] and when your Calamity comes I'm not
[30:30] going to hear you because you didn't
[30:32] regard me I'm not going to regard you
[30:35] when your Calamity comes and there's a
[30:37] big Calamity coming I see the signs of
[30:40] it don't you I mean you I could preach
[30:43] on you know brother I'm serious go look
[30:45] at what he preached on in 1964 signs is
[30:48] what he preached on I mean just over and
[30:51] over he was showing it that's the grace
[30:53] of God to preach us signs to show us
[30:56] where we're at in our journey and God
[30:59] hadn't stopped showing signs with
[31:00] brother Ram like I said the most
[31:03] anointed preaching I can do is current
[31:05] events things that are going on right
[31:07] now do you know brother brandom tyed
[31:09] Earth you know earthquakes is a plague
[31:11] that's
[31:13] right do you know an earthquake is a
[31:15] plague do you know after we dawned into
[31:18] the New Age of Aquarius what started
[31:20] happening earthquakes lots of
[31:23] earthquakes choosing of a bride brother
[31:25] R said Los Angeles capernium o capernium
[31:29] consolation of angels City of Angels the
[31:32] wrath of God is beling under you right
[31:34] now is that right what is it it was
[31:36] signs that were given but a for us it's
[31:40] a sign for them it's a flag is everybody
[31:43] understand that remember when they came
[31:46] to
[31:47] Elijah I think it maybe Ahab even I
[31:50] can't remember who he said you're plag
[31:52] in Israel right he said no you're
[31:54] plagued Israel right but I want to tell
[31:56] you something do you know a prophet is
[31:58] either a sign or a plague depends on
[31:59] which side if you accept him he's a sign
[32:02] if you don't accept him I guarantee
[32:04] he'll be a plague to you is that right
[32:06] do you know brother B typed an
[32:08] earthquake as a prophet you know a
[32:10] prophet's supposed to take you out of
[32:11] your place yeah come on is it right we
[32:14] get set in the church VI that's my seat
[32:17] right there you know so you know what
[32:19] every time Israel got in the place where
[32:22] they were just set they weren't going to
[32:23] move God sent a prophet on the seed you
[32:26] know what that do he a qu he qued them
[32:29] man he said you're the one troubling
[32:31] Israel he said no you're the one
[32:34] troubling Israel is that right so God
[32:37] when he sent a prophet it was an
[32:38] absolute earthquake to that generation
[32:41] it was a plague it took them out of
[32:43] their place you understand because why
[32:45] and I tell people our church we're Leo
[32:47] to sins fat dumb and happy right I don't
[32:50] know that's ok bonics I don't know how
[32:52] else I don't know how you say in Georgia
[32:54] but that's the way I say in Oklahoma to
[32:57] look at me I said I'm just fat dumb and
[33:00] happy we're L to sins right but God's
[33:02] got to bring something to you that'll
[33:04] shake you out of your place to where
[33:07] you'll realize where we're at and these
[33:09] things are happen like Japan all it is
[33:12] is just a sign for you to understand
[33:14] where we're at on our journey is what it
[33:16] is and you need to get yourself ready
[33:19] you need to quit playing around in this
[33:21] late hour this is not the time that you
[33:24] brother R and the seals I I it just
[33:26] amazed me how simple it really is he
[33:29] preached God in Simplicity before he
[33:30] preach the seal on the first page before
[33:33] you open the seal he said well God you
[33:35] know the reason God's given us these
[33:36] seals is to get where we'll get closer
[33:37] to God Amen to where we'll be fit yeah
[33:41] is that what he said so we'll be fit for
[33:43] the Rapture now that sounds real
[33:45] complicated don't it and we understand
[33:47] those seals were great Mysteries and
[33:49] Revelation and Thunders underneath which
[33:51] is the voice of God we understand that
[33:54] underneath the seals but the real
[33:55] purpose was was to give get you ready to
[33:58] get out of here is that what the seals
[34:00] were all about but yet we try to we try
[34:03] to get you know we got people now they
[34:06] know all the revelations and they live
[34:07] none of it it just I'm going be it
[34:10] sickens me right I mean it really it
[34:12] sickens me you you got all the mysteries
[34:14] of I'm like Paul you're nothing but a
[34:17] tinkling symbol to me that's all you are
[34:19] that's all you are you can have all the
[34:21] Mysteries and you do none of it you live
[34:23] none of it you can you know I was this
[34:26] is no lie I walked into a quick trip one
[34:28] day back home and there was a guy used
[34:30] to attend our church was standing there
[34:32] and he had a pair of cargo shorts on
[34:34] right here and so I'm paying you know
[34:37] I'm going in to pay for my gas I walk up
[34:39] there and you know and he know he knows
[34:41] me so I'm walking up there and I look at
[34:43] him he looks at me he walks up to you
[34:45] said you know I've been reading in the
[34:46] third seal yesterday I didn't say a word
[34:48] to him you know what I
[34:49] did I just dropped my looked at his
[34:51] pants yeah I thought big sister
[34:55] Society you what brother Brandon said
[34:58] BSS big sister Society you go around
[35:01] wearing shorts right and I didn't man I
[35:03] thought here's a guy he wants to he
[35:05] wants me to listen to him about
[35:06] explaining the third seal and he's
[35:08] standing there in a pair of shorts and I
[35:10] just I didn't say a word I honestly I
[35:12] did not I never commented to the guy I
[35:14] paid for my I just stood there and I
[35:15] just dropped my eyes right down his
[35:17] knees I thought you got to be kidding me
[35:20] you think I want to listen to your
[35:21] version of the third seal you got to be
[35:24] kidding me but that's what you got going
[35:27] on around the message hour they want to
[35:29] quote to quotes you said that one time I
[35:32] like that you know that has haunted me
[35:33] ever since you said that she told me
[35:35] that she said what we got around the
[35:37] message hour is a bunch of guys that can
[35:38] quote the quotes yeah she's
[35:41] right that's the reason it haunts me cuz
[35:43] I don't want to like I said I don't want
[35:44] to be Jehovah Witness I just don't want
[35:45] to be a quote quoter you know what they
[35:47] are readers quote quoters see I don't
[35:49] want to be a Jehovah Witness to the
[35:50] message I want to preach a message I
[35:53] want God to inspire me I want the Holy
[35:55] Ghost to come upon me preach a message
[35:57] of inspiration where the people will
[35:59] come up and start doing this
[36:04] message is that right that's what we
[36:07] want don't we so what I want to talk
[36:08] about is it's either a sign to you or
[36:11] it's a plague to you right one or the
[36:14] other that's what it is to you it's a
[36:15] sign or it's a plague is that right amen
[36:19] and like I say a prophet brother brandom
[36:21] what did he do he shook that
[36:22] denominational system down absolutely
[36:24] did you know he did that he shook that
[36:26] to Pieces didn't he you think they
[36:29] didn't hate him oh they hated him I bet
[36:31] when they seen him coming they said oh
[36:33] there's the one that troubles our the
[36:35] Lutheran there's the one that troubles
[36:38] this one there's the guy that's the
[36:39] problem right there why he was an
[36:41] earthquake and he absolutely man he just
[36:44] shook that thing down is what he did is
[36:46] that right so what what it was a plague
[36:49] to him but to me it was a sign it wasn't
[36:52] a plague it was a signal to me is that
[36:55] right and what is a sign signal do it
[36:57] it's it's something it's a message
[36:59] that's sent and a message that's
[37:01] received right so for it to be a sign
[37:03] it's got to be something not only that's
[37:04] sent to you it's receiv received you
[37:06] could go out here and you see the
[37:07] squiggle on the sign you keep going 70 M
[37:10] hour you didn't receive it right and the
[37:12] results going to be the same so you can
[37:13] see the sign but if you don't accept the
[37:16] sign and do what the sign says which
[37:18] really what it's telling you slow down
[37:20] really so that's what we're supposed to
[37:22] do you can see this message all you want
[37:25] you can say I'm a message believer all
[37:27] you want and you're going to end up in
[37:29] the ditch cuz if you don't do what that
[37:31] says on that sign you're going to end up
[37:33] in the ditch is that right right okay so
[37:37] I I told the church now let's let's go
[37:39] over to plagues a little
[37:40] bit and I thought well you know what is
[37:43] a plague well a plague is Affliction
[37:45] what does an Affliction bring forth
[37:46] death the whole purpose of a plague is
[37:49] to afflict you after the Affliction it
[37:51] brings you to death is that right that's
[37:54] what like the black plague that happened
[37:56] back in the Dark Ages is that right what
[37:58] is it it's an Affliction that hits you
[38:01] and it takes you to your death is that
[38:03] right and I thought to myself when I was
[38:05] doing on the plagues I thought well what
[38:07] was the first plague that ever struck
[38:08] the Earth and I thought about
[38:11] it one day I I said you know what the
[38:15] first plague was a liyon
[38:18] preacher that's why I'm not high on
[38:20] preachers if you ever if you ever
[38:21] noticed the first plague that ever
[38:24] struck the Earth was a lying preacher
[38:27] right come on was it did he afflict
[38:30] Eve's mind that's right isn't a plague
[38:32] an Affliction right the thing was he a
[38:35] plague that's good he was a
[38:37] plague Satan right there was a plague to
[38:41] Eve is what he was what did he do he
[38:43] started afflicting her mind if if the
[38:45] she what did the plague bring forth for
[38:47] her death right right man is that right
[38:50] if she wouldn't have accepted what he
[38:52] said it wouldn't have brought forth
[38:54] death but we understand the first first
[38:56] plague that ever the first plague that
[38:58] Satan ever tried to bring the Earth was
[39:00] a lying preacher right he hadn't stopped
[39:02] has he no he still used that plan pretty
[39:04] good don't he you know brother BR seal
[39:06] said a seducing spirit is a preacher
[39:09] right sure you know what he said D yeah
[39:11] that's why I say I'm not too high on
[39:13] preachers I'm a preacher but I ain't too
[39:14] high on them you know brother brandom
[39:16] said there wouldn't be many preachers
[39:17] make it yes that's right I told the
[39:19] church I said I'm I am crazy I always
[39:22] wondered I was marginal you know what I
[39:24] mean but I said when I decided to Pastor
[39:26] a church Church brother R I'm staring a
[39:27] quote in the face that says there's not
[39:29] many preachers going to make it and I'm
[39:31] pastoring I go boy you need to wake up
[39:34] you know what I mean and I thought well
[39:36] Lord you called me to this so Here I Am
[39:39] Lord right you just March out it's what
[39:41] you do so the first plague that ever
[39:43] struck the Earth was a lion preacher
[39:46] well that's something think about isn't
[39:47] it and like I say what do you got out
[39:49] here now lion preachers everywhere you
[39:52] know it just amazes me in this age we're
[39:55] in where the I mean I tell the people
[39:58] you go out to Walmart and see these
[40:00] women stri strip down you know who
[40:02] stripped them down
[40:04] preachers preachers is who stri those
[40:06] women down if those preachers had what
[40:09] they supposed to have the Baptist the
[40:11] Presbyterian all of them that say sister
[40:13] you shouldn't wear those things is that
[40:16] right so what is it it's a PL those
[40:19] women that are stripped down are plagues
[40:20] to you men right abely right do they
[40:24] afflict your mind come on brothers let's
[40:26] get real here I'm a preacher but I'm
[40:28] still a red blooded American male is
[40:30] that right you see a woman's half
[40:32] dressed and you got to do some praying
[40:34] son is that right what is it it's a
[40:37] plague that comes down that's what it is
[40:39] see people think oh I'm the bride I'm
[40:42] the bride I don't get to see any of the
[40:44] plagues you better go read Revelation
[40:46] again there's a certain amount of her
[40:48] plagues that's going to strike her but
[40:50] there were plagues right there in the
[40:51] Garden of Eden right in God's Garden
[40:54] Satan come down and started all
[40:56] producing plagues does everybody
[40:58] understand that you think he's any
[41:00] different in this ER with this is
[41:01] Satan's eating you talk about plagues
[41:03] you can look the right hand their left
[41:05] hand there is nothing but plagues out
[41:07] there you understand what I'm saying
[41:09] that's right does everybody agree with
[41:11] that now of the children of Israel they
[41:13] signs right when I see a woman half
[41:15] dressed out there I go to where it says
[41:17] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[41:19] it be in the coming in the son of man is
[41:22] that right so when I see things like
[41:23] they were marrying given in marriage
[41:26] right is that right now they brother
[41:28] said they just flat work getting married
[41:29] you know what I'm can I say it like we
[41:31] say live in everywhere you go I think
[41:34] they said in Oklahoma 70% livein now 70%
[41:38] they don't bother to go get a marriage
[41:40] license now is that right well what as
[41:43] it was in the days of Noah it said in
[41:45] the days of Noah they were they were
[41:46] they were given
[41:48] wives right didn't say a wife it said
[41:51] wives plural does everybody understand
[41:54] that so go read it in Genesis six it
[41:56] says they were GI taken and given wi is
[42:00] that way it is marriage and divorce
[42:01] marriage and divorce and half of them
[42:03] don't like say it's not a marriage and a
[42:05] divorce where we're at it's just live in
[42:07] you go you know if you don't like her
[42:09] out she goes and another one comes in I
[42:12] mean that is absolutely as it was in the
[42:14] days of Noah what is that it's plagues
[42:16] that striking the Earth it's plagues I
[42:19] told somebody the other day I said you
[42:20] know brother brandom our prophet he had
[42:22] a cross a little 2-in cross right in his
[42:26] car hanging on the mirror because of the
[42:28] women in that day now I don't know about
[42:30] you but I was around in ' 62 and ' 63 I
[42:33] didn't see too many women wearing shorts
[42:34] back then they were women were still
[42:37] awfully decent come on you guys were in
[42:39] the 60s some of you here is that right
[42:42] he had a 2 by two I said if brother
[42:43] Brennon was here now he'd have a twoot
[42:45] by twoot cross in his car and I'm not
[42:48] being funny but come on is it the
[42:51] truth come on you guys are here you you
[42:54] know you women are subjected to the same
[42:56] thing big sister Society right these men
[42:59] all stripped off and everything course a
[43:02] real woman sister would make her puke
[43:03] she's seen in these come on you know
[43:06] that's what brother ROM said right so
[43:09] you understand but these things that are
[43:10] striking her are plagues but to us it's
[43:15] signs we see the signs now and we
[43:18] understand we're at the end does
[43:20] everybody understand that so all these
[43:22] things you see out here are nothing more
[43:25] than signs or plagues depending on which
[43:27] side of the Cross you're on is that
[43:29] right exactly so it's it's a signal to
[43:32] you God is trying to Signal you the
[43:34] flashing red light of his coming God is
[43:37] trying to get this church ready for a
[43:39] Rapture is what he is he's trying to get
[43:42] you away from the world and the things
[43:43] of the world and all these things that
[43:45] are plaguing people is that right even
[43:48] in in Daniel 70 we or Daniel you know he
[43:51] said that in the end time they'd be
[43:52] running to and fro amen do you know
[43:55] brother random said that everybody was
[43:57] they were neurotics do you know one day
[43:59] I was going to preach on neurotics at
[44:01] the church so I went to a psychological
[44:03] Journal I looked up neurotics they said
[44:05] that is no longer a valid analysis and
[44:09] you know why cuz everybody's a
[44:12] neurotic brother Ram said back then
[44:14] they're one degree away from Insanity so
[44:16] if you said neuro you know what neurotic
[44:18] is running to and
[44:21] fro that's what he said in Daniel's day
[44:23] hurry up and wait how many of us why why
[44:26] are we in such a hurry you and this
[44:28] church come on don't you get in a hurry
[44:30] and you sit there at the end of the day
[44:31] you say why am I in a hurry because
[44:34] you're getting caught up in the hour in
[44:36] the day in these these it's a plague
[44:38] that struck the Earth you understand
[44:40] it's like I told Brother Joseph
[44:42] computers I started computers 34 years
[44:44] ago we dropped 80 column Cards into a
[44:47] hopper you think that wasn't fast no
[44:50] you'd take 4,000 of them you sit there
[44:51] and drop it in and watch them track
[44:54] another it took I remember I worked for
[44:57] an insurance it took us 3 days to run
[44:58] the stocks and bonds out to print the
[45:00] checks it don't take them nearly that
[45:02] long now because the computers have sped
[45:05] up so fast but when you're an IT guy
[45:07] like me when something breaks they want
[45:09] you to have it fixed 2 minutes later
[45:11] they can't wait does everybody
[45:12] understand why running to and fro
[45:15] everything the computer the T I read an
[45:17] article on the TV one time where these
[45:19] kids that watch these video games you
[45:21] remember in the old days when the
[45:23] preacher uh the old circuit Rider
[45:25] preacher he would come into a town and
[45:28] he would preach at a church and they'd
[45:30] have a service all day long did you know
[45:33] that's way the so circuit writers did
[45:35] then technology come in then they got
[45:37] the radio preachers well it was an hour
[45:39] long then they got the TV preachers it's
[45:42] 30 minutes long then these kids got into
[45:44] videos and everything and I I I really
[45:47] read this they said now you know how
[45:49] long it take how long for a preacher you
[45:51] got this many seconds long to get
[45:54] people's attention or they just just
[45:56] ignore you you know how many seconds
[45:57] they said it was seven if you don't get
[46:00] the attention of the people in 7 Seconds
[46:02] you'll lose them did you know that you
[46:04] ever look at these and then don't look
[46:06] at them but these movies that come out
[46:08] they say every 8 seconds this the
[46:09] thing's flipping you're a computer guy I
[46:11] don't know if you understand but you
[46:13] know the refresh cycle on a PC how fast
[46:15] they are and these scenes like they had
[46:17] the one the what was it the uh
[46:19] Armageddon they said they change the
[46:21] scene so fast every 8 seconds and they
[46:23] somebody asked them why did you do that
[46:25] cuz the you lose them if you don't so
[46:28] they're starting to verify that you
[46:30] understand what is that it's a curse is
[46:32] what it is it's a plague that struck the
[46:34] Earth that it that Daniel prophesied
[46:37] about that would happen in the end time
[46:39] they'd be running to and fro is that
[46:41] right brother brand said a guy would get
[46:42] in the car remember brother brand said
[46:45] he's going down the road and this guy
[46:47] around went around pulled into his
[46:49] parking lot he said an hour while his
[46:50] wife fixed lunch for him supper what was
[46:54] it it's Daniel what he trying to tell
[46:56] you Daniel's being fulfilled people are
[46:58] running to and fro they're in a hurry
[46:59] and they don't know why they're in a
[47:00] hurry I told my church why don't you
[47:02] slow down we're too big a hurry to read
[47:04] our Bibles yeah is that right come on
[47:07] help me if I'm wrong somebody help me
[47:10] say h you're too big a hurry to read
[47:13] your Bibles you're too big a hurry to
[47:15] pray you're too big a hurry to pick up a
[47:17] message book that's right is that right
[47:19] what is that you're fulfilling what
[47:21] Daniel said where they'll be running to
[47:23] and fro is that right so what you need
[47:26] to do message Believers you need to
[47:28] realize this is a sign to you that you
[47:30] need to slow your life down you need to
[47:32] get yourself by the bootstraps like
[47:34] brother brandom said and say why am I
[47:36] doing what I'm doing yeah half the time
[47:39] when I look at myself I say why am I
[47:40] doing this yeah is there any real value
[47:43] in me hurrying up and waiting all the
[47:45] time right no so what we need to do as a
[47:48] congregation we need to start slowing
[47:49] down we need to start doing what we need
[47:52] it was a sign that was given to us by
[47:53] Daniel does everybody understand that
[47:55] what we need to do is slow down and
[47:57] start reading our Bibles is that right
[48:00] okay so you understand these things that
[48:02] we're seeing going on out there the
[48:04] earthquakes it's a signed to us and they
[48:07] getting you know I preach on when that
[48:10] happened you know the earthquakes and I
[48:12] had the statistics I don't have them
[48:13] with me now but you know that last
[48:16] year the number of earthquakes that were
[48:19] hard earthquakes had
[48:21] quadrupled does everybody know that do
[48:24] you know in a natural birth the pain
[48:26] start to get harder at the end when
[48:28] you're going to birth the child you
[48:30] sisters come on help me here I mean I
[48:31] ain't have no kids so say Amen please
[48:34] right so you understand when the births
[48:36] coming it when you're close to it get
[48:39] closer together and harder is that right
[48:42] well guess what this earthquake that
[48:44] happened over there is a 9.1 it's the
[48:47] fifth largest one and you know what the
[48:49] one in Indonesia a little while back it
[48:51] was a big one right what's happening God
[48:53] is showing you by this sign
[48:56] that the Earth is fixing to be birthed a
[48:58] new is that right now that's what
[49:00] brother renom taught us in birth pains
[49:02] is that right so it's a sign to us when
[49:05] we see these earthquakes of the
[49:07] magnitude and the frequency that they
[49:09] are it's proed to us there's going to be
[49:11] a new Earth is that right well guess
[49:14] what we're going to be out of here long
[49:15] before that happens is that right we're
[49:18] not going to see tribulation folks does
[49:20] everybody understand that but I'm going
[49:22] to tell you you're going to get some
[49:24] plagues
[49:26] sure is that right in the church ages
[49:29] and you T it at our church so I know
[49:31] they've heard it cuz you taught it at
[49:32] ours I know you taught it here every
[49:34] time a trumpet sounded a War Began what
[49:38] fell a plague fell is that right every
[49:42] Church age when that messenger said
[49:43] trumpet sounded it declared a war and a
[49:46] plague fell is that all right so the
[49:49] people say well I'm not going to see the
[49:51] plagues well yeah you are you certainly
[49:54] are going to see some plagues if you
[49:55] don't see them now there's something
[49:57] wrong with your experience you ought to
[49:59] look around this and if you don't sigh
[50:01] and cry against the Abominations done in
[50:04] the land it's you don't have the mark
[50:06] that the the writer gave them is that
[50:08] right so we ought to understand these
[50:11] things we ought to see the signs that
[50:12] are going on around and what is a sign
[50:15] it's a signal to you it's trying to get
[50:17] you to direct yourself home and quit
[50:20] being this lacad isical people that we
[50:22] become these leot to sins that are lazy
[50:26] is that right we need to pull our up and
[50:30] get get to reading the message of the
[50:32] hour can I tell you that like I say the
[50:35] people expect the preacher to do all of
[50:37] it and you need to do it you understand
[50:40] you need to be praying for this man
[50:42] every day I mean these are things that
[50:44] we need to be doing as a congregation
[50:47] brother brand said what's holding to
[50:48] Rapture up the bride what is holding us
[50:51] up the Readiness of the Bride we're the
[50:54] ones holding the Rapture up
[50:56] we need to look around at the signs that
[50:58] God's put before us and realize we're at
[51:00] the end of the end now so we need to get
[51:02] our lives in order we need to start
[51:05] shaking ourselves seeing if you
[51:08] absolutely are truly abiding in the
[51:10] message of the hour see if you're under
[51:13] the messenger is that right amen so
[51:15] these plagues these plagues have been
[51:18] Fallen right we've been falling for a
[51:21] long time and we haven't recognized that
[51:23] they're falling right and like I said it
[51:26] fell on Eve in the Garden of Eden that's
[51:27] hard to imagine isn't it but she was
[51:30] afflicted there God Satan had come and
[51:32] Afflicted her mind and that plague
[51:34] hasn't stopped since then you I mean I
[51:37] don't care who you are a preacher I
[51:39] don't care how holy you think you are
[51:41] the devil's going to afflict your mind
[51:44] he's going to tell you well you don't
[51:45] have it isn't that what he likes to do
[51:48] right and then you go out there and you
[51:51] know I'm a human I got eyes and and you
[51:53] go out there and you look to the right
[51:54] man by the way was you look to the right
[51:56] there's a blond-headed woman you go oh
[51:58] you look to the left there's a brunette
[52:00] woman it's like oh my gosh it's a plague
[52:02] you understand what I'm saying there's
[52:05] plagues out there and scripture says
[52:06] you're supposed to cast down every
[52:08] imagination that exalts itself against
[52:11] God but don't get thinking you're so
[52:13] holy and Pious that these things don't
[52:16] touch you look I teach our church you
[52:19] know there was light and Goan the
[52:21] plagues fell on Egypt does everybody
[52:22] agree with that so you're going to say
[52:24] well they fell Egypt they didn't fall
[52:26] for him in Goan let me type it for you
[52:28] gan's in you yeah the light was in Goan
[52:32] the inside of the inside the plague
[52:33] don't fall there on me this is Egypt
[52:36] right here this is bondage to me there's
[52:39] plagues that fall on this don't kid
[52:41] yourself don't think you're not exempt
[52:44] from those things cuz I'm going to tell
[52:45] you you are so you think well look poor
[52:48] pitiful me look what's falling on me God
[52:50] chastens and tries his children is does
[52:54] everybody agree with with that every son
[52:57] every daughter that comes to God he's
[52:59] got a right to chasen you to try you to
[53:02] prove you right God didn't step back and
[53:04] say Satan you get away from me could
[53:06] have he done it
[53:08] sure sure he could have done it right
[53:11] but what did he do he let him try he let
[53:13] him prove God knew what they would do
[53:16] but you think God you know just like
[53:18] joob if you considered my servant Jo
[53:22] that's right that's pretty good isn't it
[53:24] right perfect man have you considered
[53:27] him you got a hedge around him man I
[53:29] can't even touch him so I'll take the
[53:31] Hedge off for me is that right right did
[53:34] the plagues fall on him was he still a
[53:36] Son of God so see brother ROM even
[53:39] taught us in the message just because
[53:41] you're going you're driving a Mercedes
[53:42] and you got a big house times are good
[53:44] don't mean you got it is that right and
[53:47] if you're poorly you may live in a
[53:49] little Shack down on wherever down on
[53:51] the river that don't mean you ain't got
[53:53] it is that right so understand so
[53:56] there's plagues that are falling right
[53:58] now can I tell you that plagues plagues
[54:01] afflictions where Satan's trying to
[54:03] constantly afflict you he's afflicting
[54:05] you out here but inside of here he can't
[54:08] get there because I've been sealed with
[54:10] the Holy Ghost there's light in Goan is
[54:13] everybody that's where the children of
[54:14] Israel resided in Goan that's where I
[54:17] live down in Goan amen that I don't live
[54:20] in out there you live out there it's CU
[54:23] you are out there that's
[54:27] right is that
[54:29] right so one or the other you got signs
[54:32] or you got plagues one or the other one
[54:36] or the other right and you're not exempt
[54:39] from the plagues I hope you understand
[54:41] that exactly I mean there's some people
[54:43] thinking a message that well I'm a
[54:44] message believer like you ain't going to
[54:46] get no Affliction I got news for you
[54:48] brother man said did he say this don't
[54:51] pack for a picnic right pack for a
[54:54] battle right
[54:55] I don't know about you but the battle's
[54:57] Affliction so the devil's coming after
[55:00] you is that right and I taught the
[55:02] church this you know you look all
[55:04] through the scripture where Israel was
[55:06] afflicted were they the children of
[55:08] Israel were they the chosen of God
[55:11] absolutely they were weren't they but
[55:13] you know I'm I'm going to show you a
[55:15] Philistine does anybody know what the
[55:16] def anybody ever looked up the
[55:18] definition of philistine you know what
[55:20] it
[55:20] is
[55:24] immigrants
[55:26] laugh but that's what it is go click on
[55:28] it Philistines is immigrants you know
[55:30] what an immigrant is it has no loyal
[55:32] allegiance to the land they're in right
[55:35] right exactly they have no loyal
[55:38] allegiance to the land they're in do you
[55:40] know what the Phil look at the
[55:42] characteristics of the Philistines with
[55:43] Israel okay
[55:46] Shamar every time this crop came up who
[55:50] come marching down to take it from him
[55:53] those immigrants right I I know I'm get
[55:57] arrested
[55:58] after you got this on video Don't you so
[56:02] I don't do that at our church but anyway
[56:04] that's okay so you understand the whole
[56:07] point of the Philistines was to what
[56:09] Israel got a blessing the Philistines
[56:11] came right there to take it away show me
[56:13] every time Israel got a a blessing the
[56:15] Philistines were on their front door
[56:17] trying to get it back you know what this
[56:20] blessing that you're getting today which
[56:22] I hope you're getting blessed the
[56:23] Philistines are going to be right there
[56:25] soon as you walk out that back door to
[56:26] take it from you does everybody
[56:29] understand that with Shamar it was that
[56:31] way every one of the characters in The
[56:34] Bible if if if you got a blessing if
[56:36] Israel was blessed the Philistines were
[56:38] right there at their door to take
[56:41] it right that's an Affliction they
[56:43] Afflicted Israel does everybody
[56:45] understand it's a plue what happens
[56:47] you'll come you'll hear me Minister
[56:48] you'll hear Brother Samuel Minister and
[56:52] you'll
[56:53] think what he just said go he just
[56:55] preached God s a prophet that's all he
[56:57] preached they go out the back door do
[57:00] you know what shamgar picked up in Ox go
[57:02] did that look very significant to kill
[57:04] 300 Philistines would have you picked up
[57:06] an oxco to kill 300 Philistines if you
[57:09] were Samson would you picked up the
[57:11] Jawbone of an ass to kill a thousand
[57:13] amen but he picked up what he had right
[57:16] does everybody understand what I'm
[57:17] saying right so you come to church
[57:19] whatever the pastor whatever you God
[57:21] gave you is that right that's the way we
[57:23] work as pastors right I told him pastors
[57:26] can't keep secrets right no that's right
[57:29] brother you know where your Prophet said
[57:30] he couldn't keep a secret thank God yeah
[57:32] right I read one day he said you he said
[57:34] you know I can't keep a secret I thought
[57:36] man am I happy I am happy because if God
[57:39] told him something he gave it out right
[57:41] that's what that's what a pastor can
[57:42] keep a secret right I hope you can not
[57:45] talking about if you come to him about
[57:46] some crazy thing in your life you know
[57:48] what I mean God reveals something to us
[57:50] we got we can't wait to get out and oh
[57:52] man I can't wait I can't wait to get a
[57:54] church give that you know and he gives
[57:56] it out and you may say I don't know if I
[57:58] understood that or not I don't know well
[58:00] you know what tomorrow promise me or
[58:03] I'll promise you the Philistines are
[58:05] going to be at your door to take
[58:06] whatever it is he gave you and it may
[58:08] not seem like much can I say that after
[58:10] you've been in the message 30 40 years
[58:12] it may not have seemed like much but
[58:14] when that Philistine comes there try to
[58:16] take something away from you whatever it
[58:18] is whatever's right there that you can
[58:20] grab right amen you grab it and you kill
[58:23] a Philistine with it
[58:25] and then you know what the guy that's
[58:27] afflicting you he ain't get nothing
[58:29] right so you may not you may think
[58:31] sometimes you come to a a service and it
[58:33] was insignificant but I'm going to tell
[58:35] you it'll kill an Affliction the next
[58:37] day some Philistines going to be at your
[58:40] door he's going to try and take the
[58:42] blessing this man gave you you take that
[58:44] blessing no matter how insignificant you
[58:46] think it is a Jawbone of an act can you
[58:48] imagine that now how can you yeah how
[58:51] can you explain that that thing been
[58:53] rotten out in the desert I I mean
[58:54] brother BR said the first time he hit
[58:56] one of those 2in helmets they brass
[58:59] helmets they had on them it should have
[59:01] exploded that Jawbone right he killed a
[59:03] thousand of them with it so don't it
[59:06] don't matter what you think you take
[59:09] what the man gives you is that right and
[59:11] then you go out the back door and I
[59:13] promise you a Philistine is going to
[59:14] come to you oh yeah that Philistine that
[59:16] plague that Affliction is going to come
[59:18] to you just like that and when it does
[59:20] you take whatever it is that you got and
[59:23] you kill it glory amen are you okay with
[59:25] that so these all these different things
[59:28] that you seen Israel were afflicted by
[59:31] these were plagues all through their
[59:33] their Journey Israelite right and God
[59:35] said go kill them take care of it right
[59:38] God sent him a prophet prophet's a sign
[59:41] right he's a sign if they listen you
[59:43] know I I preached a message here while
[59:45] back Church you know in Samuel's day
[59:48] David right David or in the book of s
[59:51] David wanted to go get the
[59:52] ark where is he going to put
[59:55] right brother if you go look at trying
[59:57] to do God one of the things was you got
[59:59] to have it's got the place got it's got
[1:00:01] to be placed right David wanted to get
[1:00:03] the ark back he had no place to put it
[1:00:06] what was he doing why was he coming and
[1:00:08] bringing the ark back and he didn't have
[1:00:10] a temporal to put it in did he he had
[1:00:12] nowhere to put the thing it cost him man
[1:00:15] life because why he got ahead of God is
[1:00:17] that right see that's what we do
[1:00:20] sometimes we're try we get ahead of God
[1:00:22] you got to be sure you're placing this
[1:00:24] thing right you understand that's what
[1:00:26] David did he was trying to do good god
[1:00:28] of service but he didn't do it with his
[1:00:29] will is that right so be careful folks
[1:00:33] you may you'll get ahead of God is that
[1:00:36] right so you better check it out and
[1:00:38] make sure you're in the perfect will of
[1:00:39] God okay so we understand the
[1:00:42] Philistines were nothing more than
[1:00:43] Affliction a plague to the children of
[1:00:45] Israel every blessing they ever got here
[1:00:47] were the Philistines do you know the
[1:00:49] Philistines I don't know if you studied
[1:00:51] out the Philistines lived on five
[1:00:53] mountains did you know that in Israel
[1:00:56] you ever looked at it in Israel the
[1:00:58] Philistines lived in 1 2 3 4 5 when
[1:01:03] children of Israel came in when they
[1:01:04] took the land they were supposed to kill
[1:01:06] all the inhabitants did they exactly
[1:01:08] they didn't do it did they when they
[1:01:10] came in they were supposed to kill all
[1:01:11] the inhabitants you know what happened
[1:01:13] the Philistines were the ones that ran
[1:01:14] out in the mountains and they got lazy

[1:02:31] saying a lot of people in the message
[1:02:32] are they don't think they're human
[1:02:33] anymore I guess they think they're those
[1:02:35] little clouds floating around in the air
[1:02:37] they can't feel touch here taste here
[1:02:40] right but no those were the Philistines

[1:03:18] he had was an ox go and he went out
[1:03:21] there and kill 300 of them you know he
[1:03:23] become a judge in is after that because
[1:03:26] why he resisted the Philistines you want
[1:03:28] to get anywhere in the message start
[1:03:30] killing some Philistines they're
[1:03:33] immigrants they don't even belong there
[1:03:35] didn't brother Rand say the devil was a
[1:03:36] squatter what was he saying he was a
[1:03:39] Philistine he has no right to be here
[1:03:41] does everybody understand that so all
[1:03:43] these different peoples were out there
[1:03:45] afflicting Israel now I'm going to tell
[1:03:47] you about another one can I tell you
[1:03:48] this amen
[1:03:51] amorites have you ever looked up the
[1:03:53] characteristic of an Amorite what they
[1:03:55] were you know what an Amorite you look
[1:03:58] in the days of of uh Abraham you
[1:04:01] remember the the the Nations that that
[1:04:03] got together and they went out there and
[1:04:06] they conquered Sodom and gomorah and
[1:04:08] they took them captive you know that was
[1:04:11] amorites go look it up that was amorites
[1:04:13] so one of the characteristic of Amite
[1:04:15] amorites were they like to organize
[1:04:18] there were five kings that were under
[1:04:20] one king you understand what I'm saying
[1:04:23] the amorites there's a characteristic
[1:04:25] that you might have missed but the
[1:04:26] amorites go look at it they would be
[1:04:29] several Kings but they put one king over
[1:04:31] them amorites
[1:04:34] right amorites and I'm going to come
[1:04:36] back to that in a minute to show you
[1:04:37] something that's happened in our hour
[1:04:39] amorites you know what another
[1:04:40] characteristic of an Amorite they they
[1:04:43] would eat anything you put in front of
[1:04:45] them
[1:04:47] yeah that might not sound from uh
[1:04:49] significant but it is to me is that
[1:04:52] about the way it is in around the
[1:04:53] message they are you can throw any old
[1:04:55] doct in front of somebody they'll lay it
[1:04:56] up it shows they an Amorite you
[1:04:59] understand Israel was cursed by those
[1:05:01] amorites those amorites constantly plag
[1:05:03] them do you understand what I'm saying
[1:05:05] but what you're supposed to do you're
[1:05:07] supposed to get rid of those things kill
[1:05:09] every one of them like I said you you
[1:05:11] didn't come to a picnic you came to a
[1:05:13] battle is that right that's right and
[1:05:15] you know you think about it and it's we
[1:05:18] always look at things out there it's
[1:05:20] right here amongst us you know and like
[1:05:22] I said you look in the message I
[1:05:24] challenge anybody you show me where it
[1:05:25] says message Church you show me where it
[1:05:27] says message Church brother random
[1:05:29] wasn't trying to build a church brother
[1:05:31] random was trying to get us out of here
[1:05:33] brother ROM was trying to get us to the
[1:05:35] son of man if we get people the son of
[1:05:38] man we don't get them to some church
[1:05:40] then they're going to take a Rapture is
[1:05:41] what they're going to do you get them to
[1:05:43] some church they're going to sit there
[1:05:44] in the Pew and die they're going to be
[1:05:47] like it little eaglit you on that little
[1:05:48] fur you know they don't want go old
[1:05:51] Jehovah starts pulling the hair out the
[1:05:53] fur and they start hitting the Thorns ow
[1:05:55] ow ow pretty soon they're going to fly
[1:05:57] is that right but that's what a lot of
[1:05:59] people around the me we're a m we're a
[1:06:01] messy Church well see they're making it
[1:06:03] real cozy for you all they're doing if
[1:06:05] you want the truth or command and
[1:06:07] they're just creating another
[1:06:08] denomination right the spirit of it
[1:06:10] right we're not we're not creating a
[1:06:12] church we're creating a bride somebody
[1:06:15] to rise up and get out of here right so
[1:06:17] the amorites they' eat any old thing you
[1:06:20] gave them did you know that anything
[1:06:23] anything another point you can come and
[1:06:25] look at the amorites remember
[1:06:27] Joshua when he was when he was in the
[1:06:30] Battle and he knew that if if the sun
[1:06:33] went down that they would regroup and
[1:06:36] then it would come back and kill some of
[1:06:37] the Israelites right you know those were
[1:06:39] amorites he was fighting do you know
[1:06:42] that God absolutely Joshua Jehovah
[1:06:45] savior stopped the Sun and the Moon and
[1:06:49] said time shall be no more does
[1:06:51] everybody get what I'm do with this time
[1:06:54] shall be no more what happened in our
[1:06:56] time when the mighty Angel come down
[1:06:58] what did he say time shall be no more
[1:07:01] did you ever understand why he did that
[1:07:02] we got some amorites to kill right we
[1:07:05] got some amorites to kill these people
[1:07:08] that'll eat any old thing you throw down
[1:07:10] in front of them we're going to kill
[1:07:11] that thing any Doctrine any saying
[1:07:14] teaching or doctrine that rises up in
[1:07:16] this message we're going to kill it is
[1:07:18] that what we're supposed to do why did
[1:07:19] he say that why did he hold the Sun so
[1:07:22] we could kill all the amorites what were
[1:07:24] amorites they like to get they were
[1:07:27] organizations and people that like to
[1:07:29] eat anything you threw in front of them
[1:07:31] does that Mak sense right so that's the
[1:07:33] whole purpose is what was said in
[1:07:35] Revelation time shall be no more is
[1:07:38] everybody got it right why it's for us
[1:07:41] God stopped that for us so that we can
[1:07:44] kill it all we're going to kill every do
[1:07:46] right you've been fighting a long time
[1:07:48] you understand we're going to kill every
[1:07:50] Doctrine right and we ain't going to we
[1:07:52] are the people we don't eat just just
[1:07:54] anything you throw down in front of us
[1:07:56] if we can't read it we can't see the
[1:07:58] scripture in the tapes if everything
[1:08:00] don't lock up don't blend together we're
[1:08:02] not going to eat it I'm not an Amorite
[1:08:05] or an Amorite I'm Jewish and I eat
[1:08:07] kosher food amen is that right I eat
[1:08:10] fresh kill I'm an eagle when he drops it
[1:08:13] down to me I eat it but I check it out
[1:08:15] by the word brother when that angel of
[1:08:17] the Lord come to me he said he gave me
[1:08:18] this scripture this scripture this and
[1:08:20] many more he said if that angel come to
[1:08:22] me and gave me something and I couldn't
[1:08:24] find an in the word I wouldn't accept it
[1:08:27] why brother BR was an Amorite does
[1:08:29] everybody understand that we're not an
[1:08:31] Amorite either we're not going to eat
[1:08:33] anything that some old preacher throws
[1:08:34] down in front of us we're going to make
[1:08:36] sure it's
[1:08:37] kosher is that right there's the
[1:08:40] significance of that so the amorites
[1:08:42] plag the people yeah is that right but
[1:08:45] see to me it's a sign it's not a plague
[1:08:48] to me you understand it plagues this but
[1:08:51] down on the inside of the inside God's
[1:08:53] taking care of me God has given me a
[1:08:55] sword he didn't just give brother brand
[1:08:58] that sword did you understand that amen
[1:09:00] exactly brother brand ain't the one
[1:09:02] who's got the king sword I got the king
[1:09:04] sword is that right it's it's a
[1:09:06] revealing it's the word that's what I've
[1:09:08] got and I'm going to go forth and I'm
[1:09:10] going to slaughter every Philistine
[1:09:12] every Amorite anything that tries to
[1:09:15] bring a plague on me I'm going to kill
[1:09:16] it you understand what I'm saying so
[1:09:19] it's a it's a it's a sign or it's a
[1:09:21] plague one of the other which is it you
[1:09:24] know and you like I say people in the
[1:09:26] message there and I I tell my church
[1:09:28] people think they're just going to sit
[1:09:30] there and they're just going to hear
[1:09:30] good preaching and they're not a part of
[1:09:32] it that all it is is just coming and
[1:09:34] saying and hearing of word preacher
[1:09:36] preach man if that was all of it it'd be
[1:09:39] that'd be easy wouldn't it well this is
[1:09:41] it ain't going to be that easy people
[1:09:43] there's some you got to go out and do
[1:09:44] something you got to go out and kill
[1:09:46] some of these things or trying to come
[1:09:48] upon you you understand and what's
[1:09:50] trying to come upon you plagues is what
[1:09:52] they are y and you know what if you'll
[1:09:54] resist the devil scripture says he'll
[1:09:56] flee from you amen amen is that right
[1:10:00] and but you look you know and brother
[1:10:02] brandom talked about and I looked
[1:10:03] through you know when I did the message
[1:10:05] this morning about a sign I thought it
[1:10:07] very unique when it talks about the
[1:10:08] coming of the Lord it says one sign
[1:10:11] that's it cuz you know if there were
[1:10:13] several signs to prove his coming that
[1:10:14] would be confusing wouldn't it so God
[1:10:17] didn't do it that way he said I'm going
[1:10:18] to give you there's the sign of the son
[1:10:20] of man one sign that's going to come to
[1:10:22] show you the com
[1:10:24] but you know what to show you the end of
[1:10:26] the
[1:10:27] world to show you the end of the world
[1:10:30] there's going to be signs does everybody
[1:10:33] understand where I'm going with that to
[1:10:34] show you where at the end of the world
[1:10:36] there's going to be signs as it was in
[1:10:39] the days of knowing so shall it be in
[1:10:41] the coming of the son of man so God has
[1:10:44] showed you we're at the end of the world
[1:10:45] is everybody it's not just the coming
[1:10:48] that now we're looking at we're looking
[1:10:50] at the signs plural which are telling us
[1:10:52] we're at the end of the road right
[1:10:54] that's why when I get up and preach I
[1:10:55] say we're at the end of the end now I'm
[1:10:57] not guessing when I say that I have seen
[1:11:00] I've read 1964 the messages and I will
[1:11:03] assure assure you the signs of the end
[1:11:05] time are here we're at the end for the
[1:11:08] Gentile kingdom does everybody
[1:11:10] understand that God's fixing to go to
[1:11:11] the Jews and there not be another
[1:11:13] Gentile saved once he goes to the Jews
[1:11:17] so I don't know what the young people
[1:11:18] are thinking you better get in now cuz
[1:11:21] when this Rapture takes place brother R
[1:11:23] said there would not be another Gentile
[1:11:25] Saint done is that right so this is not
[1:11:29] a clown around time where we're at you
[1:11:32] know I told people when I was a young
[1:11:33] man I sent a message I was 13 how old
[1:11:36] are you
[1:11:37] son 16 well I was 13 now 16 is a bad age
[1:11:41] I'm going to give you some advice now
[1:11:43] can I I know how 16 is buddy it's rough
[1:11:47] okay at 13 I was sitting in a message
[1:11:49] Church second row no first row right
[1:11:52] over here okay I had my Bible I had my
[1:11:55] message books I looked like the message
[1:11:58] of the hour and then one day a plague
[1:12:01] hit me yeah you know what it was car
[1:12:07] keys car
[1:12:10] keys car keys that's right and you know
[1:12:14] my mom handed me the car keys and buddy
[1:12:17] I never turned around took me and you
[1:12:19] know I was 30 years old before I came
[1:12:20] back to Missi it took me 14 years to get
[1:12:22] that car turned around
[1:12:26] that's right seriously seriously it was
[1:12:28] a curse to me it wasn't a blessing it
[1:12:30] was a
[1:12:32] curse is that
[1:12:34] right but that's what I want to say that
[1:12:36] you know there's son when I left back I
[1:12:40] was in I see when I been that been about
[1:12:42] 1972 when you were preaching no before
[1:12:44] that
[1:12:47] even about 68 I know I had to
[1:12:50] recalculate took me a while 68
[1:12:54] well you know the Revelation the
[1:12:55] breaking of the son of man hadn't really
[1:12:56] come yet I'm sorry but it didn't and I
[1:12:59] tell people in our church cuz they look
[1:13:00] at me and they say well you dropped out
[1:13:02] and you come back you're pastoring the
[1:13:04] church yeah so kids look at that and
[1:13:06] they say oh man you're going it's
[1:13:08] happily thereafter no we didn't have the
[1:13:11] Revelation it wasn't breaking back then
[1:13:13] the son of man you understand all we had
[1:13:16] was God sent a prophet there was all
[1:13:18] sorts of things going on in God sent a
[1:13:20] prophet does everybody understand what
[1:13:21] I'm saying it really was so when I got
[1:13:23] the car keys vroom off I went you know
[1:13:27] but when I came back what I came back to
[1:13:29] is the son of man that's the that's what
[1:13:31] I came back under you children here are
[1:13:33] under the son of man Ministry what's
[1:13:36] left for you you go out you go away from
[1:13:38] this what's going to happen you I don't
[1:13:40] know I'm not trying to scare you but
[1:13:42] we're at the end of this thing this is
[1:13:44] the last sign what is the last sign that
[1:13:46] was given mezic the word made flesh that
[1:13:49] was the last sign that was given is that
[1:13:52] right so there were signs given but that
[1:13:54] was the last sign that this generation
[1:13:57] is going to see is the sign of mezic is
[1:14:00] that right so if you you children here
[1:14:02] you ain't got no time to clown around
[1:14:05] you I mean I'm sorry I'm not trying to
[1:14:07] cheat you out anything trust me I
[1:14:09] clowned around out there for 14 years
[1:14:11] and I didn't find any I found one good
[1:14:13] thing right
[1:14:14] there and it was God's grace that she
[1:14:16] came in with me I don't know what the
[1:14:18] only reason well I w't say that well
[1:14:20] yeah I will God looked over the gift
[1:14:22] right I had a gift in my life I didn't
[1:14:24] even know it I was a knad right but God
[1:14:27] looked over me and he protected the gift
[1:14:29] to being a pastor cuz if I have married
[1:14:31] her and she' have divorced me and I have
[1:14:33] married something done you understand
[1:14:35] what I'm saying so God looked after the
[1:14:37] gift is what he did my wife has come in
[1:14:40] she believes the same message I do will
[1:14:42] it always end up that way I don't think
[1:14:43] so right I'm telling you don't try that
[1:14:47] don't try God is that what I said God
[1:14:49] can try you but you better not try God
[1:14:52] is that right and you know what you know
[1:14:55] we say well you get on where you get off
[1:14:57] right when I came into the church I when
[1:14:59] we came there was a big meeting going on
[1:15:02] it's just people everywhere and me and
[1:15:04] my wife come to back door they didn't
[1:15:06] have a seat open to set but right here
[1:15:07] on the front row do you know I
[1:15:10] physically I understand that quote that
[1:15:13] brother man said you get on where you
[1:15:14] got off I got off right there and 30 14
[1:15:17] years later I come through the back
[1:15:19] doors of that same church I sit right
[1:15:22] down there and preacher got up in the
[1:15:24] pulpit and preached the son of
[1:15:26] man do you know I I I read before I came
[1:15:29] to the church there I was going to a
[1:15:30] charismatic church I told you when they
[1:15:32] prophesied over me I read one and I knew
[1:15:35] brother Brandon was a prophet that's one
[1:15:36] thing I got when I was 13 years old I
[1:15:38] did get God sent a prophet nobody could
[1:15:41] ever talk me out of William Brandon
[1:15:42] being a prophet that was done there you
[1:15:44] know I was under a son of man I knew he
[1:15:47] was a prophet absolutely and when I came
[1:15:50] back before I came I read proving his
[1:15:52] word brother said the word was made
[1:15:55] flesh in this day right I said I was
[1:15:58] praying I said Lord if you're here in
[1:16:00] the flesh give me the same opportunity
[1:16:02] you gave the disciples to either accept
[1:16:04] you or reject you that's all I'm asking
[1:16:07] for that's simple just let me accept you
[1:16:10] if you're here let me come face to face
[1:16:12] with let me accept you or reject you
[1:16:14] just a little simple prayer I was
[1:16:16] reading a book never thought about it
[1:16:18] two weeks later brother Jess's niece ran
[1:16:20] into me at Kmart I was buying a fishing
[1:16:22] lure that's when I was in a bass fishing
[1:16:23] I thought like a fish I mean I mean I
[1:16:27] was on the lake all the time you know I
[1:16:29] think brother Danny and brother Wade
[1:16:30] were too from what I understand but
[1:16:32] anyway she come up to me and said Claude
[1:16:34] I don't want to tell you this this woman
[1:16:36] told me I don't want to tell you this
[1:16:37] she wasn't even going to brother Jess
[1:16:39] church because his niece she heard he
[1:16:41] was having a Revival over there they had
[1:16:43] some black brothers and sisters vising
[1:16:44] from South Carolina singing and you know
[1:16:47] and I told her I said well I like
[1:16:49] singing so she said yeah oh they're
[1:16:51] having a big Revival over over there
[1:16:53] singing and you know he invited me but
[1:16:55] the Lord told me now is't that odd and
[1:16:57] you know what I was going with that
[1:16:59] woman to the church she was going to the
[1:17:01] charismatic why would she invite me to
[1:17:03] another church right you think God don't
[1:17:06] work in strange ways folks he does don't
[1:17:08] he so she says I don't my I don't want
[1:17:11] to tell you this but God told me I'm
[1:17:13] supposed to tell you this I thought well
[1:17:15] okay but she said the other hand so I
[1:17:17] told my wife went home and said you know
[1:17:19] what I'd like to go I'd like to go you
[1:17:21] know I'd like to go I like good singing
[1:17:24] you know so I went over there like I
[1:17:26] said come through the back door right
[1:17:27] here the preacher was up there and he
[1:17:29] preached the son of man I wore contacts
[1:17:32] then I cried them out of my eyes me and
[1:17:33] a black brother crawled around on the
[1:17:35] carpet trying to find my contacts at the
[1:17:36] end of that service I got to see the son
[1:17:39] of man I got to see the word made flesh
[1:17:42] does everybody understand that right

[1:17:48] sign and signs given out there to help
[1:17:51] you on your journey is is that right and
[1:17:54] so when you look at things out there
[1:17:56] it's it's not just a plague it's a sign
[1:17:58] to you to show where we're at in our
[1:18:00] journey am that's the point I really
[1:18:02] wanted to to get to you here this
[1:18:04] morning okay it's absolutely a sign to
[1:18:08] show you where you're at and all the
[1:18:11] signs have run out does everybody
[1:18:13] understand that you've had to sign a
[1:18:14] Jonah is that what he said brother
[1:18:17] random said the Queen of Sheba was a
[1:18:19] sign do you know Sheba if you look at up
[1:18:21] is seven
[1:18:24] you know Sheba is seven means seven the
[1:18:26] queen of seven that's who I am amen I'm
[1:18:29] the queen of seven is that right you're
[1:18:32] well you don't but you know you know you
[1:18:34] see that where it says s seven s on the
[1:18:36] slot machines they got that from the
[1:18:38] Queen of Sheba it always shows a queen
[1:18:40] on them you ever notice that that's the
[1:18:41] Queen of Sheba they mimicking is what it
[1:18:44] is but so you're the Queen of Sheba
[1:18:47] you're the one who goes across the
[1:18:49] desert you're the one who's on a journey
[1:18:52] you're the one wants to hear the wisdom
[1:18:54] of Solomon is that right we are the ones
[1:18:57] and it even shows up in this day it was
[1:18:59] a sign that was given to you brother bam
[1:19:01] said when he preached the seals or what
[1:19:03] was the seals no future home 1500 miles
[1:19:05] they come to hear that message what was
[1:19:08] it it was a sign of the Queen of Sheba
[1:19:10] all these things were given to show you
[1:19:12] that we're at the end of time is what it
[1:19:15] is right there's not much time left I
[1:19:18] hope everybody understands that you can
[1:19:20] take all these signs that we given Noah
[1:19:23] you know lot was a sign to the
[1:19:27] sodomites when lot left they should have
[1:19:30] realized it was time to burn brother BR
[1:19:32] said Enoch was a sign to Noah you know
[1:19:35] when Enoch went up brother BR said that
[1:19:37] was a sign to Noah he needed to get
[1:19:39] ready that the flood was coming does
[1:19:41] everybody know he said that so Enoch was
[1:19:44] a sign so there's signs all around and I
[1:19:47] think sometimes it's leot Deans we're
[1:19:50] almost dumb to the signs that around we
[1:19:53] don't really pay attention to what they
[1:19:54] are out there what their purpose is but
[1:19:57] and like I said this morning and I hope
[1:19:59] this will grind it home to you the
[1:20:01] purpose is you right
[1:20:04] amen God don't play games you think God
[1:20:07] you think God's wasting this time out
[1:20:09] there in that Jun no it's just signs
[1:20:11] that are given for you all these things
[1:20:14] that brother Rand go pick up that
[1:20:16] cigarette package brother said I ain't
[1:20:18] picking that up yeah what go pick it up
[1:20:21] he had a message he wanted to preach it
[1:20:23] was a sign to brother brand he had to
[1:20:25] pick it up is that right so you see all
[1:20:28] these things out here what are they
[1:20:30] they're signs to us to show us where
[1:20:32] we're at right so that we might not fall
[1:20:35] in a ditch is what it is is that right
[1:20:38] right so these are the thing that's what
[1:20:39] I wanted to understand is people think
[1:20:41] oh yeah the plagues are going to be yeah
[1:20:43] they always look oh yeah yeah oh the
[1:20:46] pressure when the pressure comes brother
[1:20:48] R said the pressure is now exactly did
[1:20:50] you know there's a quote he said the
[1:20:51] pressure is now amen message people were
[1:20:53] sitting here like I said this morning
[1:20:56] fat dumb and happy and we don't realize
[1:20:58] the very thing we're looking to happen
[1:21:00] is happening right you need to look at
[1:21:03] the current events made clear by
[1:21:05] prophecy is that right brother said
[1:21:08] modern events it's the same way of
[1:21:09] saying it modern events made clear by
[1:21:12] prophecy so right now the things you're
[1:21:14] looking to happen are happening and you
[1:21:17] need to catch the sign of it so you
[1:21:20] won't fall in the ditch is that right
[1:21:23] that's the whole purpose of all this
[1:21:24] thing all that you see around here is
[1:21:26] for you right that's right brother boy
[1:21:29] he must love me
[1:21:31] brother everything he you ought to be
[1:21:33] that like I said you ought to be the
[1:21:35] happy happy happiest people on the face
[1:21:38] of the Earth right everything everything
[1:21:40] you see God's doing it for you he ain't
[1:21:43] doing for that out there
[1:21:45] Glory he ain't doing that for them right
[1:21:48] he's doing it for you right amen all
[1:21:50] these things it's for you it's to show
[1:21:52] you where we're at so that you'll be
[1:21:54] ready you'll not be caught unaware is
[1:21:56] that right so that's what it
[1:22:00] plagues and signs right that to the
[1:22:03] children of Israel they were signs to
[1:22:06] those Israel or to those Egyptians they
[1:22:08] were plagues is that right right but see
[1:22:12] that's the way it is so we got some here
[1:22:15] yeah right oh yeah sure come on and the
[1:22:19] devil's going to afflict you as soon as
[1:22:20] you walk out that door sure
[1:22:23] he'll afflict your mind he he doesn't
[1:22:25] you know the devil don't change his
[1:22:26] tactics
[1:22:27] either if he did Eve that way and he
[1:22:30] attacked her mind get ready when you
[1:22:32] leave here he's going to start chipping
[1:22:34] away at your mind too amen that's even
[1:22:37] Paul warned you that did he not 2
[1:22:39] Corinthians 11: 2 and 3 as the serpent
[1:22:42] beguiled Eve through his subtility I
[1:22:44] fear that your minds be
[1:22:47] corrupted from the Simplicity that was
[1:22:50] in Christ Jesus is that right exactly no
[1:22:52] wonder brother brand and preach God in
[1:22:54] Simplicity you understand cuz it is very
[1:22:57] simple but it came to a simple people
[1:23:00] right if if it was hard simple people
[1:23:02] couldn't get it the common people
[1:23:04] couldn't receive him gladly if it
[1:23:06] was let see it's not scripture says a
[1:23:09] fool need not he therein right
[1:23:12] right is that right God used to win wink
[1:23:15] at ignorance he don't wink where we're
[1:23:17] at right cuz ignorance is to ignore it
[1:23:19] did you know that you're not going to
[1:23:21] get away with ignoring message now you
[1:23:23] set a message Church you hear the TR
[1:23:25] truth preached by a preacher God's not
[1:23:28] going to bless you anymore if you ignore
[1:23:31] what this man says you're in trouble
[1:23:33] right I'm going to tell you that you're
[1:23:35] in trouble now we know the last plague
[1:23:39] that struck the church right was dead is
[1:23:42] that what he said right that's what
[1:23:45] we're looking at now and brother man
[1:23:46] said there's people dying right on the
[1:23:48] church pew so don't tell me the plagues
[1:23:49] ain't Fallen that's you'll never
[1:23:51] convince me there ain't plagues falling
[1:23:53] where we're at absolutely right is that
[1:23:56] right amen and you know you know what
[1:23:58] death really is don't you organization
[1:24:01] right they'll sit right there and
[1:24:02] organize right is that right like I told
[1:24:06] it's what they do they organize you can
[1:24:07] have a an organizational Spirit each one
[1:24:10] of you sitting here today and it'll
[1:24:12] bring death to you is what it will
[1:24:13] exactly is that right it'll bring death
[1:24:15] to you is what it will but I told him to
[1:24:18] church and and I want to say this and
[1:24:19] I'm going to close in the first church
[1:24:21] age he came forth to conquer and
[1:24:23] conquering we know that's nickan Spirit
[1:24:25] wasn't it right now I'm going to bring
[1:24:27] it down remember I said that the first
[1:24:29] plague that ever struck the Earth was a
[1:24:30] lion
[1:24:32] preacher is it
[1:24:34] right let me show you something there's
[1:24:36] plagues that have struck some of the
[1:24:38] message churches the guy will ride out
[1:24:40] he'll have a saying a teaching or a
[1:24:42] Doctrine is that right yeah then the
[1:24:45] next thing he's on a white horse he'll
[1:24:46] ride that for a while he'll jam it down
[1:24:49] to people's throat because he's there to
[1:24:51] conquer them I'm the I'm the big dog
[1:24:53] around here I got the message of the
[1:24:56] hour you're going to have to listen to
[1:24:57] me that nickol in spirit it's my way or
[1:25:00] the highway and that what they do so
[1:25:03] they have a saying a teaching a Doctrine
[1:25:05] then what happens after a while they
[1:25:07] stay on that horse for a while then they
[1:25:08] get off on the red horse then you know
[1:25:10] what they'll do they say if you don't
[1:25:11] believe it like I believe it they'll
[1:25:13] kill your influence right right they'll
[1:25:16] ask you to leave the
[1:25:18] church you know that right they'll take
[1:25:21] their sword out and they'll kill your
[1:25:23] influence is what they do and if brother
[1:25:25] Samuel and me don't believe with what
[1:25:27] he's doing then they'll kill us
[1:25:29] too is that the red horse rider and that
[1:25:32] what he goes around to do then the next
[1:25:34] horse he gets off on is the black one
[1:25:36] you don't want the black horse rider
[1:25:37] what brother Bram said he does he has
[1:25:39] daughters underneath that so he gets out
[1:25:41] he kills all the ones that don't agree
[1:25:43] with him the ones that agree with him
[1:25:44] that's the daughters now he's got on
[1:25:46] that black horse rider they form a
[1:25:48] little click this preacher will preach
[1:25:50] for that preacher that preacher will
[1:25:51] preach for this preacher they won't let
[1:25:52] anybody else in their little click does
[1:25:54] everybody understand that now they've
[1:25:56] rode the black horse rider and guess
[1:25:59] what happens after the black horse rider
[1:26:01] right all three of those get mixed up
[1:26:03] and it's dead right and brother man said
[1:26:05] that's the last plague that's going to
[1:26:06] strike the Earth does everybody agree
[1:26:08] with
[1:26:09] that I want to declare to you that
[1:26:12] plague is striking
[1:26:13] now cuz that's what's happened around
[1:26:15] the message of the hour exactly they go
[1:26:17] out there they try to get somebody to
[1:26:18] agree with them if you agree with them
[1:26:20] okay if you don't they kill you with
[1:26:22] their sword is that
[1:26:24] right then they'll go out and get their
[1:26:27] daughters other churches that'll agree
[1:26:29] with them right that's right and then
[1:26:32] what do they do they organize and what
[1:26:34] does organization bring
[1:26:37] debt now that's what they do but the
[1:26:40] individual can do the same thing did you
[1:26:42] realize that that's right amen you can
[1:26:44] have a saying a teaching a doctor don't
[1:26:46] agree with your
[1:26:47] pastor right then what you'll do you'll
[1:26:50] kill anybody in the church that don't
[1:26:51] agree with what you
[1:26:53] got is that right then you're going to
[1:26:56] ride around the church trying to figure
[1:26:57] out if somebody in here will agree with
[1:26:59] what you
[1:27:00] got is that right and if they do what's
[1:27:02] it you usually they'll pull them out the
[1:27:04] back door they'll start another assembly
[1:27:05] somewhere oh yeah and then what does it
[1:27:07] bring forth that right and I'm not
[1:27:09] saying every time that people leave a
[1:27:11] congregation it's for that it could be
[1:27:13] because the guy that's preaching ain't
[1:27:15] preaching a good doct exactly brother
[1:27:17] said I told the church the only reason
[1:27:19] you can leave a church that I can see
[1:27:22] is if the guy ain't preaching right if
[1:27:24] the guy's preaching false Doctrine
[1:27:26] brother R says you get you find you a
[1:27:28] preacher when you're spiritually fed you
[1:27:30] remain there the rest of your life but
[1:27:32] if that guy ain't preaching thus sayeth
[1:27:34] the Lord if he's not preaching the
[1:27:35] message ER you better run from that guy
[1:27:38] I would hit that back door in a hurry
[1:27:40] then is that right amen so you know you
[1:27:42] got to watch you got to have a balance
[1:27:43] in what I said that's why I said it but
[1:27:46] uh the plague that's HIIT now in the
[1:27:49] ranks is death right right amen so it's
[1:27:54] a very serious
[1:27:55] time as brother say they're dying right
[1:27:58] here on the church pews so right now you
[1:28:02] could be dying in this church if you
[1:28:04] organize and if you decide you got it
[1:28:07] all figured out is that
[1:28:09] right you're the big guy around here I'm
[1:28:12] the boss around here and you try to
[1:28:13] conquer everybody in the congregation
[1:28:15] with some say teaching or doctorine you
[1:28:17] have you better watch out right is that
[1:28:20] right that's right man
[1:28:24] so I'm going to close on that one I
[1:28:25] don't even know what time I got started
[1:28:26] now probably been too long so it's
[1:28:29] either plagues or signs is what it is
[1:28:33] when you go through the message there I
[1:28:34] just challenge you when you're studying
[1:28:36] you know I know you probably got a lot
[1:28:38] of other things to study brother
[1:28:39] Samuel's preaching but go
[1:28:41] through and look at where he says signs
[1:28:44] and you'll find that you'll find it be
[1:28:46] the Queen of Sheba you'll find it be the
[1:28:49] sign of Jonah is that right all these
[1:28:52] things are signs signs signs that God's
[1:28:54] give
[1:28:55] you and it's to show you we're at the
[1:28:58] end time that's his whole purpose in is
[1:29:00] to show this little bride where we're at
[1:29:03] cuz how you going to know if you don't
[1:29:05] know where you're at how you going to
[1:29:06] know where you're going I mean if you
[1:29:08] had a map out and you're sitting there
[1:29:10] at the map you're going I don't know
[1:29:11] where I'm at well you're in deep trouble
[1:29:14] if you don't know where you're at you
[1:29:15] don't know where you're going so that's
[1:29:16] what these signs were given for us to
[1:29:18] know where we're at right right right
[1:29:22] and when you see these plagues it signs
[1:29:25] to us right that's what it is it's
[1:29:28] afflictions out
[1:29:30] there and it's just to show us where
[1:29:32] we're at folks it's the fulfill all it
[1:29:35] is is the Fulfillment of scripture y
[1:29:37] it's these dumb dog preachers that won't
[1:29:39] preach them they got tingling ears they
[1:29:41] won't correct it out there and they and
[1:29:44] literally the preachers Lyon preachers
[1:29:46] just like it was in the days of Eve lion
[1:29:49] preachers have stripped them women off
[1:29:50] out there
[1:29:52] Lyon preachers is what's brought that
[1:29:54] plague on the earth out there is that
[1:29:56] right amen exactly sure that's why I say
[1:30:00] I'm I'm not always real high on
[1:30:02] preachers cuz I know what they can get
[1:30:04] their yourself into you know what I mean
[1:30:06] but a true preacher it's an awesome
[1:30:09] thing somebody will bring you thus
[1:30:10] sayith the Lord yes it's a very awesome
[1:30:13] thing I know some of you here have
