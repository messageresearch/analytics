[2:41] this middle of the week all right
[2:45] we got him
[2:47] end of the week coming up
[2:51] this is our supercharged day
[2:54] yeah
[2:55] you know what I was thinking yesterday a
[2:58] little bit about
[3:00] about church service you know and
[3:04] I always
[3:06] bigger than most people go to church
[3:08] just because it is Wednesday
[3:10] Sunday
[3:11] but um
[3:13] we shouldn't do that shouldn't be
[3:14] something that's on the calendar that
[3:15] we've got to do should be something we
[3:17] want to get here and get some more fuel
[3:19] and some more fuel too
[3:22] to combat the devil with because faith
[3:25] comes by hearing right one of the
[3:27] brothers that brother Clark's Church
[3:28] sent me a uh text message and and I'm
[3:31] I'm going to start listening to some of
[3:33] his Daniel 70 weeks series that he's
[3:34] doing out there
[3:36] and brother sent me a
[3:38] message from there and said well uh
[3:41] aren't you studying you know can't you
[3:44] study in other words he was making a
[3:45] funny and I said I just take him back I
[3:47] said fight Young by hearing yeah right
[3:49] great comes by hearing we gotta hear
[3:51] just as much as you guys know right
[3:53] right I mean my goodness you know
[3:54] brother Brown
[3:55] even had to hear right he got messages
[3:58] from the from the Lord but he got him
[4:00] you know
[4:02] life comes through the body right the
[4:05] body of Christ is where life comes
[4:07] through it's not uh you can get a sermon
[4:09] for maybe somebody in a Baptist Church
[4:10] but you know what it's uh it's something
[4:13] that you're gonna have to bring over and
[4:15] and God's gonna have to Quicken to Your
[4:16] Heart Right and your life and uh
[4:19] and then we can bring it to the people
[4:21] and then life can come through the body
[4:22] man all right because I believe that's
[4:24] where life does come through and that's
[4:26] the body it's good to be in the house of
[4:28] the Lord just remember this little uh
[4:30] this little kid here uh I know they're
[4:32] going to have it during Sunday
[4:34] our service on Sunday but it's going to
[4:37] be from 12 to 6. if anybody like to
[4:39] donate to this little kid uh to remind
[4:43] me that's why I'm wearing this bracelet
[4:44] we we donated money and then I want to
[4:46] wear this and just keep praying for you
[4:48] just keep praying for him it reminds me
[4:50] to pray for him maybe we ought to wear a
[4:52] bunch of these up for arm problem people
[4:53] downstairs would remind us to pray for
[4:55] all these people and uh and that because
[4:58] he needs prayer he's a little small
[5:00] three-year-old
[5:02] uh student and probably doesn't realize
[5:04] what's going on but you know God has the
[5:06] answer to all things that's right
[5:08] Remember by web announcements let's get
[5:09] finished with this brother Samson
[5:11] shetty's going to be here one day next
[5:13] week next week next Wednesday next
[5:15] Wednesday and then brother Samuel
[5:17] prakash cook that is going to be with us
[5:19] on September the 9th
[5:21] and then remember that June and I are
[5:23] leaving August the 31st we're going to
[5:25] brother Ron Spencer's um camp meeting up
[5:28] in Virginia until be back on September
[5:32] the 4th so just keep us in your prayers
[5:35] we'll be traveling during that time I
[5:37] also remember September the 8th will be
[5:39] a Minister's meeting at brother Bill
[5:41] yount's Church it will be on the Daniel
[5:44] 70 weeks and Dan and I are going to be
[5:46] the guest speakers so just keep us in
[5:49] your prayers because we are I'd rather
[5:50] preach to a bunch of Center
[5:52] I hope this don't go out too far I'd
[5:55] rather preach a bunch of Center than to
[5:57] preach to a bunch of preachers
[6:00] so that's why brother Jess always said
[6:03] before he got real sick and I had a
[6:04] chance to sit down with him he said he
[6:06] said you know I always took the preacher
[6:08] out he said I had more problems with
[6:09] preachers than I did anybody he said I
[6:11] take a preacher out by mistakes and
[6:13] while he was eating that steak of course
[6:14] he was up again to eat it because it was
[6:16] free he said while that preacher was
[6:18] that a big old bite of steak in his
[6:19] mouth chewing and he said I talked to
[6:20] him and he said he couldn't talk back
[6:23] but he had to sit there and even listen
[6:25] so it's good to be good to be that to
[6:27] where brother Jesse used a lot of wisdom
[6:29] as far as talking to preachers because
[6:30] they said they had more problems the
[6:32] preachers than he did with the lady and
[6:34] that's about the same way it is around
[6:35] the message
[6:36] but now September the 15th will be a
[6:39] fellowship meeting at brother call my
[6:41] londorius I think yes and I don't know
[6:44] who's going to be the speaker there but
[6:45] if anybody would like to go that just
[6:46] kind of covers another few weeks of
[6:50] going and doing and trying to serve the
[6:52] Lord all right we got your Bibles let's
[6:54] turn to Romans 1
[6:58] and tonight I um I sat down a couple
[7:00] days ago and was trying to uh we've been
[7:03] doing working on the fifth seal
[7:04] downstairs and it just didn't seem right
[7:06] to go
[7:07] that way
[7:09] um
[7:10] of course we're doing it in a Sunday
[7:11] school class but uh I couldn't get away
[7:14] from this thought
[7:15] and that's the just shall live by faith
[7:18] yeah you know from what you know brother
[7:20] Keith was preaching this weekend or
[7:22] whatever right and what brother Quinn
[7:24] had been preaching the week before you
[7:25] know about wisdom and and brother Keith
[7:28] showing us that we are to be agents of
[7:30] adoption there's got to be a journey
[7:32] though to where the that you've got to
[7:34] see that God has made you just as
[7:37] righteous as he is glory and it starts
[7:40] with
[7:41] believing it exactly the just shall live
[7:44] by faith that was Martin Luther's theme
[7:45] is that right right and Martin Luther
[7:47] preached justification is that correct
[7:49] all right but now he preached it in a in
[7:52] a way that that's a little it's not
[7:54] different than what we're looking at it
[7:55] at but it was his journey complete
[7:58] Journey Through the church ages us as
[8:00] Christians in this end time it's part of
[8:03] our journey right we can't stay in
[8:05] justification we got to move on God
[8:07] moved on so we have to move on all right
[8:09] God had to leave that denominational
[8:13] idea that that look not Luther had but
[8:16] the lutherans right took Luther's
[8:19] message and denominated it and then God
[8:21] said no that's not it because they put a
[8:23] period and then they started over and
[8:25] said this is it and they stayed here and
[8:27] God moved on to sanctification well
[8:30] that's what you and I have got to do
[8:31] because if you stop at justification in
[8:33] this end time you're not born again
[8:35] right all right so we're going to go
[8:37] through just a small form but we're
[8:39] going to not use one quote
[8:41] we're going to use all scripture in the
[8:43] Bible so we're gonna we're gonna burn
[8:45] the screen up this evening and uh Lord
[8:48] will try to get through some things that
[8:50] maybe hadn't seen about
[8:51] just but Luther remember Luther came out
[8:54] of the Catholic church where you had to
[8:56] do Penance you had to do work you had to
[8:58] do this you had to do that and finally
[9:00] God revealed to him brother Chris that
[9:02] hey
[9:03] the just man
[9:05] shall live by faith right that's right
[9:07] and if you will that's going to be in
[9:09] habakkuk we're going to read it in a
[9:10] minute too but that's where it came from
[9:12] that was the first time it was mentioned
[9:14] and you'll see that it's a little bit
[9:15] different variation of what habakkuk
[9:17] said as to what we're going to read here
[9:19] in Romans so I know we have
[9:22] requests and we prayed again but if you
[9:24] got something on your heart that you
[9:26] want to raise your hand and say God's
[9:28] save my children and uh
[9:31] you know anything you just raise your
[9:34] hand and then we're going to Bow our
[9:35] heads and do like brother Keith said
[9:37] we're just going to start claiming these
[9:38] things right man that's right Mountain
[9:40] be thou moved
[9:42] right all right dear heavenly father we
[9:44] pray Lord you'd come Among Us in a
[9:46] special way tonight Lord
[9:48] it should take all the doubt and fear
[9:50] and anxiety and things of the world that
[9:52] You O Lord just as we say to leave them
[9:54] at the back door that you'll come and
[9:56] reveal yourself to us Lord that in a
[9:59] form of justification Lord that we if we
[10:02] don't see that with the judge shall
[10:03] truly live by faith then Lord it is
[10:06] worse then Lord it is something that I
[10:08] did or or someone did but we're going to
[10:11] read in the Bible where you told a man
[10:13] named job
[10:14] that his that his justification was
[10:17] nothing
[10:18] because he tried to justify himself but
[10:20] Lord if you'll justify us tonight if
[10:23] you'll take us and walk us through these
[10:25] scripture Glory this is the Eternal Word
[10:26] of God that we'll be talking about for
[10:29] all eternity but you give us Lord a
[10:31] space of time to to talk about these
[10:34] things and to realize that truly we are
[10:37] justified by faith we got to have faith
[10:40] in something so Lord let us put our
[10:42] faith in the word of God let us put our
[10:44] faith in you tonight Lord and for all
[10:46] the ones that had their hands lifted up
[10:47] mine was lifted too Lord save my
[10:49] children saved Lord the ones that are
[10:52] lost the ones that are on the on the
[10:54] wall downstairs Lord that that you'll
[10:58] take and bring them in Lord one by one
[11:00] we see Lord the hand of God moving in
[11:03] many lives but we pray Lord that you
[11:05] just continue to do that continue to
[11:07] move in our life Lord be in with each
[11:09] one here Lord tonight take care of them
[11:11] Father we pray Lord that you forgive us
[11:13] of our sins and our thoughts and our
[11:15] ideas against you Lord that you'll give
[11:17] us strength Lord for the Bible this
[11:19] ahead take care of us Lord tonight lead
[11:22] us and guide us be with the ones that
[11:23] are not here that are sick you said you
[11:25] sent your word and healed them Lord so
[11:27] as the word Goes Forth Lord may you heal
[11:29] each one of us
[11:31] may you buy the Brokenhearted Lord
[11:34] free the captain
[11:36] the ones Lord that have demons hanging
[11:38] over their head Lord May May the clouds
[11:41] be moved back tonight by the word of God
[11:43] and by the testimony Lord that we give
[11:45] father just bless us now and take care
[11:47] of us be with a little bride around the
[11:49] world be with the missionaries on the
[11:51] Foreign Fields Lord give them strength
[11:52] give them fruit for their labor Lord and
[11:55] we know you will father for we ask these
[11:57] things in the love of the name of Jesus
[11:58] Christ
[11:59] amen amen and the bride says amen amen
[12:02] Romans 1
[12:04] verse 16. we're going to pick some of
[12:06] these scriptures out so if you want to
[12:08] keep your Bible you can or we can do it
[12:10] on the screen and I'm going to read it
[12:11] out of my Bible because I have things
[12:13] written inside of it that I want to uh
[12:16] to bring out for I am not ashamed of the
[12:19] gospel of Christ for it is the power of
[12:21] God unto salvation
[12:23] to everyone does what
[12:26] believeth right not just believe but
[12:29] believeth amen amen justification is an
[12:31] ongoing act to the Jews first and also
[12:34] to the Greek for their end is the
[12:36] righteousness of God reveal from Faith
[12:38] to Faith therein what they're in the
[12:40] gospel right right for therein therein
[12:43] where the gospel of Christ
[12:44] is the righteousness of God revealed so
[12:48] it's got to be a revelation from Faith
[12:49] to Faith as it is written the just shall
[12:52] live by faith now let's go to habakkam
[12:55] two and four that'll be hard to find so
[12:58] we'll just read it right here tobacco
[13:00] two enforces behold his soul which is
[13:02] lifted up is not upright
[13:06] by himself
[13:09] a little bit different
[13:11] there's a word added in there but the
[13:13] just shall live by his faith amen all
[13:16] right it's not it's not really yours
[13:19] you're supposed to have faith and that's
[13:21] pretty personal to the just shall live
[13:23] by his faith right now you may be seated
[13:25] and the Lord has blessing and reading of
[13:27] the word
[13:27] and I brought the Greek Mexican words
[13:30] which which most of them are going to be
[13:33] common to each one of us but let's go
[13:36] through them one more time because we
[13:38] got a lot of new ones here and maybe
[13:39] some of them will click in online that
[13:41] that's um it's just starting in a
[13:44] Christian journey I believe God uh you
[13:46] know as well as I do how how uh the Lord
[13:50] brings out things to a pastor and he
[13:52] brings it and he comes back around and
[13:53] he circles back around he circles back
[13:55] around well what's he doing he's picking
[13:56] up all the ones that need to be picked
[13:57] up right amen because I believe one
[14:00] thing's for sure we need an experience
[14:01] amen we need an experience from God
[14:04] right right
[14:05] um a lot of us a lot of you uh you know
[14:08] you just appear in a church and then you
[14:10] just are here well that's what I said
[14:12] about Wednesday night and Sunday we just
[14:14] appeared do we just appear are we here
[14:15] to get up Revelation right are we here
[14:19] to know exactly where we are brothers
[14:21] you can know where you are at any time
[14:24] wow you got to look into the word the
[14:26] word of God will tell you where you're
[14:28] at right all right at any one time but
[14:30] let's look at this word justification I
[14:33] looked up it's a word just justify
[14:36] justification Justified Justified and
[14:40] all these things but look at some of
[14:41] these
[14:42] there's nothing negative about
[14:45] justification amen it's all positive
[14:48] right
[14:49] right it means to be righteous
[14:51] to be just
[14:53] to be right
[14:55] to be meat
[14:57] and it's also righteous judgment because
[15:00] you and I being being justified of what
[15:03] we've done
[15:04] makes us where we can be
[15:07] just enough to judge others right
[15:10] everybody understand that just enough to
[15:13] judge others because you got to be at a
[15:14] place uh we were talking uh a guy from
[15:18] the
[15:19] from Dave Ramsey called me yesterday
[15:21] yeah he did a guy from Dave Ramsey
[15:23] called me yesterday want to know how the
[15:25] the class was going because we were one
[15:27] of the first ones to start the new class
[15:29] and I told him I said well the the lady
[15:32] that did our first class she was not
[15:35] very good at what she was doing because
[15:37] she didn't follow what the teachings
[15:39] were
[15:40] and that'd be like brother they were
[15:41] getting up here teaching you a trinity
[15:43] but wanting you to believe one guy yeah
[15:45] you know in that same way with her it
[15:48] wasn't there wasn't anything fruitful
[15:50] come out of it much except it made me a
[15:52] desire it gave me a desire to do what
[15:55] was said and then to teach it to other
[15:57] people and that's the same way with God
[16:00] is that God is with us he don't want us
[16:03] to have somebody that's that's
[16:06] um let's put it this way it looks
[16:08] whirling
[16:09] to be an example to the church right and
[16:12] it's like it's like you know we were
[16:14] watching the class last Sunday
[16:17] and Dave's right when he said he said
[16:19] God's not going to give you what you
[16:21] can't handle right he knows what you can
[16:24] handle right if you can't handle money
[16:26] he's not gonna give you any more that's
[16:28] right if you can't handle personal
[16:29] finances you're not gonna get you
[16:31] anymore right if you can't handle God's
[16:33] word he's not going to give you any more
[16:34] but there's steps to where you can
[16:36] that's why we have to start at
[16:37] justification we have to start somewhere
[16:40] where God says you're just right and
[16:43] then we have to believe that that's what
[16:44] God Said Amen
[16:46] because what we say about it we're going
[16:48] to read job in a minute job was talking
[16:50] about him being judged that's not good
[16:52] right there's nothing good about my own
[16:54] Justice
[16:55] all right it's just what God's just God
[16:58] is going to give us and that's why I was
[17:01] making an example for those of you that
[17:02] were in class you know we were talking
[17:03] about this downstairs but I believe this
[17:06] you'd say whatever you want to brother
[17:08] Dale's been successful because he's not
[17:10] fleece to people
[17:12] for money we know these preachers many
[17:14] preachers that they get themselves in
[17:16] such a bind and they get themselves
[17:17] where they can't make their bills and
[17:19] they need two thousand dollars a week so
[17:20] they to live so they fleece the people
[17:22] you know
[17:23] oh they don't do that right he made it
[17:25] and that's the same way I was saying
[17:27] well I'm trying to get myself to where
[17:28] if something ever happens to brother
[17:30] Dale and you have to vote a pastor in
[17:32] and I'm the assistant pastor you've got
[17:33] to vote me in if something happens
[17:36] I'm saying I'm not saying you got to
[17:37] vote me in but I'm saying I'm in line to
[17:39] just kind of help until y'all find
[17:41] somebody but why would you find somebody
[17:42] that was off the word
[17:44] had 50 million dollars in debt bounced
[17:47] 150 checks
[17:49] would you put somebody like that in the
[17:51] pulpit God's not going to trust you with
[17:53] the word if you do the same thing with
[17:55] what he gives you right
[17:57] right you ought to think about that man
[17:58] but God has made it to where there's a
[18:01] place and I'm making a point he's made
[18:03] it where there's a place of where you
[18:05] look at that where it says innocent
[18:06] right faultless Guiltless right
[18:10] now all those things we've done in the
[18:12] past we've got to believe and
[18:14] justification we said well that's baby
[18:16] form justification and God forgive us of
[18:18] our past sins and we're just getting
[18:20] started and we're just newborn babies
[18:21] but my Heavens people
[18:24] look what it says when we Guiltless
[18:29] Brother David whatever you've done in
[18:31] your past if you're truly Justified God
[18:33] don't know that anymore right
[18:35] God don't even account that to you
[18:38] anymore right if he means Guiltless that
[18:40] means if I went to court and somebody
[18:42] said you did so and so if they found me
[18:45] Guiltless if I didn't do it then I'd
[18:47] never done it right they can't put me in
[18:50] jail right that's why we're going to
[18:52] look later on when we start reading
[18:53] scripture we're going to see that if
[18:55] it's not by faith and then we're going
[18:57] to move to see that it is by works and
[18:58] faith but if it's not by faith if we
[19:02] don't believe that then we're not
[19:03] justified
[19:04] that's why
[19:06] that's one Luther said the judge shall
[19:09] live by faith right his faith tobacco
[19:13] said right your faith makes it personal
[19:15] the judge I'm going to live by my faith
[19:18] right amen
[19:19] that's right exactly because I'm not
[19:21] born again at justification
[19:25] right remember you have faith when
[19:27] you're born again right you have his
[19:29] faith when you're born again exactly I
[19:32] got to have my faith to believe I'm
[19:34] heading toward that right all right
[19:36] everybody understand that right approved
[19:38] of or acceptable of God
[19:42] you're Justified today if you're just a
[19:45] newborn babe God has accepted you
[19:49] and approved of you right in
[19:51] justification now I'm not saying that's
[19:53] where he's pleased to dwell he's not
[19:54] pleased to dwell right now but he has
[19:57] accepted something right right he's
[19:59] accepted your faith amen where you gotta
[20:02] confess we're going to read that by your
[20:04] words you are
[20:06] Justified and by your words you're
[20:08] condemned right by your words not his
[20:11] words your words but when we come under
[20:13] the born-again experience then it's all
[20:16] what he does
[20:17] good
[20:18] right justification is our works amen
[20:21] I'm gonna read James in a minute James
[20:24] is going to tell us we got to have work
[20:27] because words without faith is dead
[20:28] right
[20:30] all right
[20:31] so we can't be justified
[20:34] and not have an experience
[20:36] you've got to have an experience of
[20:38] justification right not just saying I'm
[20:41] Justified you've got to have an
[20:43] experience that's what I was telling
[20:44] when we were we're baptizing them there
[20:46] uh the other day when when you go down
[20:49] in that water that old man's dead
[20:52] that old man is buried right
[20:55] if you dig him up you're going to have a
[20:56] stinking carcass on your hands
[20:59] but he's dead because you are working to
[21:03] something God counts you innocent and
[21:05] faultless you'll go to heaven
[21:07] right right right you won't be Brian
[21:10] let's don't talk don't worry about that
[21:11] let's just talk about babies right
[21:13] newborn babies in Christ brother Brown
[21:15] said sure you'll go to heaven right
[21:18] right because you have been forgiven of
[21:20] your past amen now what you do further
[21:23] you got to give an account for right
[21:25] right some of you that are starting out
[21:28] and you're still doing things wrong
[21:29] don't worry about that right
[21:31] you say God I believe because it's him
[21:35] his faith amen my faith I gotta believe
[21:38] amen
[21:39] we know that turns into God's face but I
[21:41] got to stand somewhere and say hey I
[21:43] believe that I don't have to pay Penance
[21:46] I don't have to to do novenas I don't
[21:49] have to you know go to the Baptist
[21:51] Church and Shake somebody's hand right
[21:53] no I just gotta believe all right that
[21:56] God has forgive me of my sins right
[21:59] there amen right right there amen
[22:02] that's not gonna stop the devil
[22:04] but it is going to put a spot down like
[22:07] I told him drive a state down and say
[22:09] Satan right there that's where the old
[22:12] man died
[22:14] and leave it alone right because you're
[22:17] working towards something now you stay
[22:18] that way
[22:20] see even even Judas even Judas was
[22:23] justified we know the prophet told us
[22:25] that Judas was justified Jesus was
[22:28] sanctified
[22:30] but he didn't go on right to the new
[22:33] birth
[22:34] right but he was justified
[22:37] but he was forgiven of this past
[22:40] but he had a present and a future that
[22:42] he had to worry about because he didn't
[22:43] go on and get covered right under the
[22:47] blood
[22:48] because we're going to read in just a
[22:50] minute I don't think we're going to get
[22:51] done with this all right
[22:52] go to the second one
[22:55] here's another one Justified be free
[22:59] be righteous
[23:01] the justifier
[23:03] to render righteous or such he ought to
[23:06] be in other words you're working towards
[23:08] something
[23:09] to show exhibit
[23:12] events one to be righteous such as he is
[23:16] and wishes himself to be considered in
[23:18] other words when we put him in down in
[23:19] baptism that's what that shows that
[23:22] that's an outward expression that an
[23:24] inward Works being done that's what
[23:26] they're saying and wishes himself to be
[23:28] considered you're you're welcome into
[23:30] the family of God right right
[23:32] right that's right I know your name goes
[23:35] on the book of sanctification as a
[23:36] Believer but you know what you got to be
[23:38] justified first right right exactly
[23:39] you've got to show that something is
[23:42] going on and wishes himself to be
[23:44] considered to declare pronounce one to
[23:47] be just righteous or such as he ought to
[23:50] be all right let's go to the next one
[23:51] number three or we're not going to get
[23:52] finished with these scriptures tonight
[23:54] the Lord justification the act of God
[23:57] declaring men free from guilt and
[24:00] acceptable to him as enduring to be
[24:03] righteous in other words working towards
[24:05] right or justification the act of God
[24:09] declaring
[24:11] men free from guilt and acceptable to
[24:14] him God accepts your faith at
[24:16] justification right because you don't
[24:18] have his faith yet you're starting you
[24:20] got a beginning part of his faith but
[24:22] you got to learn just like just like
[24:24] riding a bicycle just like anything else
[24:26] you're gonna you know you're gonna fall
[24:28] you're gonna fall you're gonna fall but
[24:31] once you get to learn how to ride a
[24:32] bicycle
[24:34] do it you just jump on it and go you
[24:37] don't even think about it same way with
[24:38] God if you start out right you only end
[24:40] right amen amen that's what I'm trying
[24:42] to see make each and every one of us
[24:44] realize that not just walking in a
[24:47] message church and sitting down and
[24:48] appealing for 10 or 15 years I told him
[24:50] downstairs in a Sunday school class and
[24:52] I mean this from the bottom of my heart
[24:53] if you're the same spot you were at two
[24:55] years ago you're either backslid or you
[24:57] lost right right
[24:59] one other two right back later lost
[25:03] I got quiet yeah but I'm telling you if
[25:06] we don't it what brother Brown says we
[25:08] stop God keeps moving right right right
[25:11] if we stop then wherever we left God at
[25:14] right there he's gone on right somebody
[25:16] else is going on all right all right
[25:20] let's go now
[25:22] and let's read
[25:24] let's do number four right here this is
[25:25] a good one to be just be righteous
[25:28] to have a just cause being the right see
[25:32] because it's the right thing to do
[25:35] you're going to have problems you're
[25:36] going to have things that's still going
[25:38] to bother you but it's the right thing
[25:39] to do to start and say God I'm going to
[25:42] do what you say I'm going to have faith
[25:44] that you've done what you said you're
[25:45] going to do if you don't then you always
[25:48] going to have them all sins and they're
[25:49] going to pop up anyway because you're
[25:51] gonna you got them in your brain sure
[25:53] right right that's right man all that
[25:56] that we've done David before we were
[25:58] born again we still remember it right
[26:01] God of God will do away with it and it's
[26:05] going good time but the devil doesn't
[26:06] know that he just keeps coming oh yeah
[26:08] but you know what you do though you just
[26:10] let him slide right off right but see
[26:12] being the right to be justified to be
[26:15] just of God
[26:16] to be righteous in conduct and character
[26:19] you think well that should be
[26:20] sanctification No it should be that you
[26:23] begin somewhere right to say I've
[26:25] changed right
[26:26] I'm Gonna Change
[26:28] amen all right
[26:30] to be put made right be justified see
[26:33] there's nothing negative to this it's to
[26:35] me it's to point us in the right
[26:36] direction what is repent brother Brian
[26:38] said repent was turn around that's right
[26:42] and walk in a different way right that's
[26:44] why the Bible says walk in newness of
[26:46] life
[26:47] to do bring justice justice to declare
[26:50] righteous justify to justify vindicate
[26:53] the cause of right man that's a good one
[26:57] have you been Vindicated amen right
[27:00] not by man but by God have you been
[27:04] Vindicated has gone Vindicated God's
[27:06] Vindicated the ministry in this church
[27:08] he's Vindicated the people in his church
[27:10] he's Vindicated what's going on all
[27:12] right so what
[27:14] must be Jeff
[27:16] okay must be just that's right we got to
[27:19] be gesture God won't do it
[27:21] all right
[27:22] even to be successful in life people you
[27:24] got to start somewhere and you got to
[27:26] turn around from what you were doing
[27:27] right right you know the old saying is
[27:30] if you aim at nothing you'll hit it
[27:32] every time right
[27:34] but you gotta aim for something you
[27:35] gotta you gotta get a goal and say I'm
[27:37] gonna and you know you say well yeah
[27:40] that's just Mind Over Matter
[27:43] maybe that's where y'all start yeah
[27:44] that's where it begins at
[27:47] you know the beginning of mine right
[27:49] well you all the team try to change that
[27:50] thing try to change our our thoughts and
[27:53] our ideas but God somewhere is going to
[27:55] vindicate your justification that's
[27:57] right
[27:58] because you're gonna go
[28:00] man that don't bother me anymore right
[28:02] right
[28:05] I don't say that stuff anymore
[28:09] I really do like going to church yeah
[28:11] right I really do like being around
[28:13] these nutty people
[28:15] they're different
[28:17] that's what I want to be right I want to
[28:19] buy this say I'm normal
[28:20] I'm not normal
[28:22] I'm different
[28:24] God likes people being different right
[28:26] people like the same old same old same
[28:28] old no I want somebody to be different
[28:30] see vindicate the cause of so he's going
[28:33] to vindicate your cause
[28:35] and your cause the Bible says is cause
[28:38] what for Christ right all right so
[28:40] that's the main focus
[28:42] reason I'm doing this is because
[28:45] and I I was thinking that this morning
[28:48] there's only going to be a very small
[28:50] group of people
[28:52] that's in this end time that's even even
[28:55] in this church age that's heard of this
[28:57] message and the things of the message
[28:59] that you hear here like seals and and
[29:01] Daniel 70 weeks and how God sent a
[29:03] prophet and all these things
[29:06] that don't make you say
[29:08] right no that's right the Bible tells
[29:10] you how to get saved right now we know
[29:12] the prophet preached out of the Bible
[29:14] and he made this thing very plain to us
[29:16] very plain but Salvation did not come
[29:20] through a prophet right
[29:23] salvation didn't come through brother
[29:25] Brandon right he didn't save nobody
[29:27] that's right not one person exactly God
[29:30] is the one he had to go back into the
[29:32] scripture and pull out the things and
[29:34] say hey this is the right way I love it
[29:37] on on the future home brother Brown said
[29:40] I've come this far and still
[29:43] I see the three same works of Grace that
[29:46] he preached when he first started which
[29:48] was justification sanctification baptism
[29:51] of the Holy Ghost the earth goes through
[29:53] the same thing the same thing we go
[29:55] through it first
[29:57] justification David under justification
[30:00] God
[30:01] SWAT this whole world off with what
[30:03] water right
[30:04] water baptism right he baptized his
[30:07] whole earth
[30:08] Justified it right that's right but what
[30:12] happened when men come up
[30:15] he just starts sinning again right
[30:16] because justification doesn't it chops
[30:19] off your past sin but it doesn't do
[30:21] anything for you present right so
[30:23] there's your your guide that's what he
[30:24] done with Noah he wiped the whole earth
[30:26] off and sin just went right on down into
[30:29] sanctification Jesus had to come and
[30:31] drip his blood on this Earth to do what
[30:34] cleanse and claim everything that was in
[30:36] the earth and where was your body your
[30:37] body was in this earth right so when
[30:39] that blood dripped on on the earth the
[30:41] blood is the sanctifier amen all right
[30:44] we know the life and the blood but the
[30:45] look the blood dripping was the
[30:47] sanctification that changed things amen
[30:50] sanctification changes you that's where
[30:53] you really gonna see a change that's
[30:55] where I I'm just speaking from
[30:56] experience here I'm not the woman that
[30:58] taught the class that didn't do anything
[30:59] it was taught in the class
[31:01] I know a little bit I've had a journey
[31:03] I've been somewhere
[31:05] you know I've got a cause and I believe
[31:07] God's Vindicated the cause but we come
[31:10] to a spot to where that the J you got to
[31:13] see that justification was Noah
[31:15] sanctification when Jesus uh spilled his
[31:19] blood on the Earth but you and I come
[31:20] through justification sanctification the
[31:22] baptism with the Holy Ghost this earth
[31:24] is waiting for a baptism when all this
[31:26] sin is finished that's why the Holy
[31:29] Ghost burns the sin off right so he's
[31:31] got to burn the Earth off right right
[31:33] he's got to burn up the centers and the
[31:35] and the uh he got really burn the
[31:38] centers up and that last burning he
[31:40] burns the soul right the soul of that
[31:43] Sinner's gone it's not on this Earth
[31:45] anymore that's why it's your that's why
[31:46] in your new birth that's what happens
[31:48] justification sin just continued
[31:50] sanctification sin discontinued
[31:53] but once you're born again sin could
[31:55] continue amen continue in in the inward
[31:57] man right same thing with Earth he can't
[31:59] step foot on his Earth just like just
[32:01] like God said I'll not dwell on an
[32:03] unclean vessel right right you and I he
[32:05] won't dwell in an unclean vessel well he
[32:06] can't put his foot on this Earth until
[32:08] we get rid of the sin and then God's
[32:11] made manifest in us and this thing our
[32:12] hair has changed right pretty simple but
[32:15] pretty profound so let's go to Romans 8.
[32:22] now let's read ruins hey I got more read
[32:24] out of my Bible because like I said I've
[32:26] got some points that I want to I don't
[32:28] want to show all right everybody okay
[32:30] yeah I gotta come down here
[32:34] Benny said all we got was my bald head
[32:36] back in my bald head the other night so
[32:38] I'm gonna try to move over here a little
[32:39] bit moreover whom he did predestinate
[32:42] Demi also called
[32:46] he called you right that's right what
[32:48] then there's your cause you make a move
[32:50] toward that man all right
[32:52] this might be simple but we need it
[32:57] for whom he did let's read moreover whom
[33:00] he did predestinate and he also called
[33:02] who he called
[33:04] them he also Justified
[33:06] and whom he justified them he also
[33:09] glorified if you're truly Justified then
[33:12] this scripture tells me you're just as
[33:14] just as God is
[33:16] if you walk in the way he knows if you
[33:20] will or not
[33:21] he knows if you'll stop he knew Judas
[33:24] was going to stop at sanctification that
[33:26] wasn't a that wasn't a uh a surprise to
[33:29] the Lord the Lord knew it from the
[33:30] beginning right
[33:32] what shall we say to these things if God
[33:34] be for us who can be against him he that
[33:37] spared not his own son but delivered him
[33:38] up for us all how shall he not win him
[33:42] also freely give us all things Glory
[33:44] through him who shall lay anything
[33:49] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[33:52] God's elect amen
[33:54] it is God that justifies not man it is
[33:58] God no preacher nobody can justify you
[34:00] all right we're all born in sin we're
[34:03] all shaping iniquity we all got problems
[34:05] we all got things that we've done we
[34:07] were born the same way every one of us
[34:09] what but who shall lay anything to the
[34:12] charge of God's elect if God has
[34:15] Justified you back and I'm not changing
[34:17] scripture that's exactly what he said
[34:18] right all right it is God that justified
[34:21] who is he that condemneth
[34:25] who is he to condemneth right
[34:28] is Christ that died yeah whatever it is
[34:31] risen again who is even at the right
[34:33] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[34:37] for us all right let's go to let's go to
[34:40] now this is this is where job is going
[34:42] to get in trouble yeah job says if I
[34:44] justify myself
[34:47] my own mouth shall condemn me
[34:50] hello right my own mouth will condemn me
[34:54] in other words I'll be able to want to
[34:56] show it you don't have to tell me I'll
[34:57] condemn my own self right if I say I am
[35:00] perfect
[35:02] it shall also prove me perverse that is
[35:06] what this is
[35:09] then you come down to joke 32 elohu
[35:11] comes out
[35:12] right job's like I didn't do this I
[35:15] didn't do that I didn't do this do's and
[35:16] don'ts and don'ts that's what he was
[35:18] doing right I didn't do this I didn't do
[35:19] that then was kindled the wrath of
[35:22] Elohim in the scripture is a type of who
[35:24] Christ remember that's the one right he
[35:26] had three three people that that
[35:28] condemned him and then eliu comes on the
[35:30] same which is a type of Christ then
[35:33] which kindled the wrath of Elohim the
[35:34] son of bear shell of the Buddha of the
[35:37] Kindred of ram against job was his wrath
[35:40] Kendall because he justified himself
[35:42] rather than God right
[35:45] in other words God hadn't Justified job
[35:49] was trying to justify himself right and
[35:51] elohu comes down and tells him a few
[35:53] things but we don't have time to get in
[35:54] that let's go to proverbs 17.
[35:58] listen to this
[36:00] eat it Justified at the wicked and he
[36:03] that condemneth the judge even they both
[36:06] are an abomination
[36:08] to the Lord
[36:10] you can't justify wickedness
[36:12] right right that's what he's saying you
[36:14] can't justify wickedness and you if you
[36:16] condemn the just you're condemning God
[36:18] right
[36:20] that's why Satan can come and he can
[36:22] accuse you and condemn you but God's the
[36:25] only one that you need to listen to
[36:26] about condemnation right
[36:29] condemn you always
[36:32] forget it period he's going to condemn
[36:34] you
[36:35] remember in Romans 8 1 it says there's
[36:37] therefore now no condemnation to who to
[36:41] them who are in Christ Jesus not the
[36:43] regular world but to those who are in
[36:45] Christ Jesus so he that condemning to
[36:47] just even they both are an Abomination
[36:49] to the Lord
[36:50] so in other words that's why the Bible
[36:53] said you speak evil against a man of God
[36:56] and whatever you speak just made it back
[36:58] to you right amen right so we need to be
[37:00] careful right Isaiah 45 25 and the Lord
[37:04] in the Lord there's your key in the Lord
[37:07] shall the seed of Israel be justified
[37:11] and shall Glory right all right now
[37:14] we're going to move into the New
[37:15] Testament into Matthew
[37:17] Matthew 12 36
[37:20] and listen to what he says here
[37:24] but I say unto thee that Every Idle word
[37:27] that men shall speak
[37:30] your testimony right
[37:32] Every Idle word that men shall speak
[37:36] right they shall give account thereof in
[37:40] the day of judgment amen for by thy
[37:44] words
[37:45] Thou shalt be justified in other words
[37:47] what is it your confession which is your
[37:49] faith that's where it comes from right
[37:52] it comes from right here first you've
[37:54] got to confess it by thy words thou
[37:57] shall be thou shalt be justified
[38:00] and by my words Thou shalt be condemned
[38:04] right spoken word that's where it comes
[38:06] from because Jesus said out on the heart
[38:10] proceedeth all things and what not the
[38:12] heart the the thumping gizzard out of
[38:15] the heart in other words out of your
[38:16] being
[38:19] the mouth speaks all right you know
[38:22] brother Brown said you know give me two
[38:23] minutes with a guy I'll tell you whether
[38:25] he's born again or not let me go to his
[38:26] house let me see what he listens to hey
[38:28] you know it's kind of like in the in the
[38:30] course the fbu course we're doing you
[38:32] can do that with your checkbook
[38:35] it's an accountability thing if you go
[38:37] down through the chat button you see
[38:38] beer wine cigarettes
[38:41] well you know that guy's not a Christian
[38:43] all right you look through the check
[38:45] register you know you look through my
[38:46] check register says hunting dude hunting
[38:48] do hunting dude hunting magazines yeah
[38:52] hunting clothes
[38:56] no I play guns cash hunt clothes but if
[38:59] you see that then you see my
[39:00] characteristic is that what I spend my
[39:02] money on because the Bible says where
[39:04] your heart is that's where your riches
[39:06] are right right all right so you see
[39:09] that I'm a Hunter
[39:10] some of you you can go to look down to
[39:12] them see that you're a fisherman some
[39:13] people go after their look that you
[39:14] don't go to church and pay your car the
[39:16] whole lot yeah
[39:20] for by thy words Thou shalt be justified
[39:24] and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned
[39:26] let me tell you something the Bible says
[39:28] the little things it's the little foxes
[39:31] that spoil the mind not the big wolf not
[39:33] the big bear
[39:35] it's your little attitude right my
[39:37] little attitude
[39:40] right for by thy words Thou shalt be
[39:42] justified and by Thy word thou shalt be
[39:45] condemned
[39:47] uh I Think Jesus said that
[39:49] it's in red letter right
[39:51] we need to work on that Joe see if we
[39:53] can get one without red letter in it
[39:55] just make it all ready yeah all right
[39:57] let's go to the next one Luke 18. listen
[39:59] to what he says
[40:00] the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with
[40:03] himself God
[40:05] I think thee that
[40:07] I'm an adopted son of God
[40:11] and I don't fellowship with people and
[40:14] and I've missed Church half the time and
[40:17] and and I talk about to be told and I do
[40:20] this and I do that
[40:22] and I'm not like that guy that comes to
[40:24] church every Sunday
[40:26] and the guy that perseveres I fast twice
[40:29] a week I give ties of all that I possess
[40:32] yeah now this is Jesus Jesus is telling
[40:35] this Parable and Republicans standing
[40:38] afar off
[40:39] would not lift up so much of his eyes
[40:41] into heaven but schmote his breasts and
[40:43] said God be merciful to me a sinner
[40:45] now this is what Jesus said I tell you
[40:47] this man went home to his house
[40:50] Justified right rather than the other
[40:53] for everyone that exalted himself shall
[40:56] be abased right and everyone that
[40:58] humbles himself shall be exhausted right
[41:01] you see what happened you watch Jesus
[41:03] he's watching these Pharisees and that's
[41:05] the same way we gotten a message we got
[41:07] Pharisees we got Sadducees it's just
[41:08] different people same spirit Spirit
[41:11] doesn't die the spirit just came over
[41:12] here that's what we were talking about
[41:13] the other day
[41:15] the Pharisees and Sadducees were so
[41:17] close to Jesus
[41:19] right they were confronting each other
[41:22] all the time because it was too
[41:23] religious
[41:26] um people I say are two religious items
[41:29] coming together keep bringing the true
[41:31] word of God and them thinking they're
[41:33] the word of God same way in the message
[41:36] same way in the messages ways Pharisees
[41:38] the second season the message same as
[41:40] they are we're back then right and
[41:42] they're turning God down we be of
[41:44] Abraham
[41:45] we be of this camper we be of William
[41:48] Brown yeah yeah no I want to be of God
[41:50] because that's what God says right here
[41:52] that Publican who said God be merciful I
[41:55] don't want us ever to forget that we
[41:56] were Sinners to me man exactly
[41:59] if we ever forget that we were Sinners
[42:00] only I know we're supposed to come to
[42:03] adoption and all that stuff and that's
[42:04] fine but you know what you're still a
[42:05] center right brother said you sin every
[42:07] day he said that when he was adopted
[42:09] right we said every day have to have
[42:12] forgiveness be forgiven Glory okay so
[42:14] let's just be humble
[42:16] and then God will put you in the front
[42:18] seat amen remember brother Brown was
[42:20] talking about that guy that came up to
[42:21] the pulpit and he was so exalted and
[42:23] sold this and so that but he came back
[42:26] down humble and he said if he'd have
[42:27] went up the way he came down right
[42:29] right he wouldn't win he wouldn't have
[42:32] went down the way he came up or he lost
[42:33] the virtually everyone that worked but
[42:35] that's the way he was saying if he
[42:36] wasn't very humble because you know what
[42:38] even in justification
[42:41] to remember the almighty God
[42:43] has wiped your book amen whatever was
[42:46] written about you
[42:48] from the day you walked up here and said
[42:50] God forgive me of my sins I am a sinner
[42:53] and I want to do something about it I
[42:56] want you to do something about it from
[42:58] that day back
[43:00] I don't care what you did
[43:04] but he said well maybe I'll blasphemy no
[43:06] if you're standing right here with his
[43:07] tears in your eyes and you really are
[43:09] repenting you never blast me right from
[43:11] if you blaspheme you never can come to
[43:13] God you never will want to come to God
[43:15] but if you did God took that book that
[43:18] he was writing that we were talking
[43:20] about the other day God writes and
[43:22] Records your life and he cleaned that
[43:25] sucker just clean as it could be right
[43:27] now from that day forward
[43:30] he keeps he starts recording Again The
[43:33] Angels start recording but from that day
[43:35] back because we're going to read
[43:36] scripture in just a minute where Paul
[43:38] said
[43:39] search for some of you whoremunders
[43:42] thieves murderers robbers
[43:46] effeminate we're going to read it in a
[43:48] minute he said but such were some of you
[43:49] right amen but you are washed but you
[43:52] are Justified so Justified is not just
[43:54] some little baby form that we that we
[43:56] think well we need to just get Justified
[43:58] so we can go get in the Sanctified
[43:59] condition and we start shouting and
[44:01] praising God now if you get Justified
[44:02] you ought to shout and praise God right
[44:04] because he's done away with your past
[44:06] sins you're done I mean as far as
[44:08] brother Brown said you die that day you
[44:09] go to heaven
[44:11] right what happened that's what happened
[44:14] to the thief on the cross right
[44:16] right God said this day you'll be with
[44:18] me in Paradise in other words this day
[44:19] from this day whatever you've done from
[44:21] that day back I don't even count it to
[44:22] you right if he had one thing against
[44:25] him he couldn't win the paradise right
[44:27] right couldn't win
[44:29] so think about justification a little
[44:31] bit more light than you're saying well
[44:33] I'm Justified no it's a big deal right
[44:36] big deal all right let's go to Isaiah
[44:41] 53 11.
[44:44] so this is what happened job was trying
[44:46] to justify himself man has always tried
[44:48] to justify even we do in our human life
[44:51] we try to justify what we do right yeah
[44:54] all right that's what we get in trouble
[44:55] now watch what God did God came down in
[44:58] human flesh to do one thing right he
[45:01] shall see the travail of his soul that
[45:03] was the soul of almighty God it was
[45:05] hanging on that cross
[45:06] and he shall be satisfied by his
[45:09] knowledge shall my righteous servant
[45:11] justify many right
[45:14] one act
[45:16] and he justified many for he shall bear
[45:19] their iniquity because he didn't have
[45:20] any to take with him to the Cross he
[45:22] took hours right all right see we get
[45:24] away from that back to my point there's
[45:26] going to be billions of people in heaven
[45:28] there's not going to hear about the
[45:29] seals there's not going to hear about
[45:30] the damn 70 weeks it's not going to hear
[45:32] about William Brown being a prophet
[45:34] but the Bible's full of it but the
[45:36] Bible's full of how to get saved first
[45:38] yeah right get them to Christ first
[45:41] start acting right start doing right and
[45:43] then the message will come I don't like
[45:45] these just these readers
[45:47] that's what we've become just a bunch of
[45:49] readers we can read quotes
[45:51] when I was a sinner doing things in the
[45:53] world I knew what the Bible said about
[45:55] it serpent seed the devil noted I was
[45:58] thinking about this this morning the
[45:59] devil knows more about surfacing we do
[46:00] yeah right he was there right right yeah
[46:03] he was the one doing the talking right
[46:06] yeah so he wasn't fooled right then the
[46:09] Bible says that he knows there's only
[46:11] one God right and he feeds us a Trinity
[46:14] right so the devil sometimes a lot more
[46:17] religious than we are and that's the
[46:18] problem is being religious but but you
[46:20] know about the serpent seed brother
[46:22] Brown said it's just you can read that
[46:23] in the Bible in order to be able to
[46:24] prove that right you know Jim was
[46:26] talking to uh to my cousin the other day
[46:28] and and they were just you know
[46:30] mystified about how how uh Jim could go
[46:34] through the scripture and she wasn't
[46:35] preaching to him but she was testifying
[46:36] no
[46:38] you know she just said simply she said
[46:40] you believe it was an apple do you
[46:42] really believe it was an apple yeah it
[46:44] caused all this and they just kind of
[46:46] looked at each other you know kind of
[46:47] dumbfounded
[46:49] and she said did they go put fig leaves
[46:51] on their hands in their mouth yeah
[46:54] teaching all they covered up their
[46:55] private part right so where do you think
[46:58] the shame came from right all right so
[47:00] just simple stuff like that and then
[47:01] they're like
[47:02] and then one of them I think one of the
[47:04] other ones said to said to my cousin
[47:05] said well last day on Friday yeah well
[47:08] you know I'm but the guy one of my point
[47:10] is the guy's not born again let's go and
[47:12] put our our reference them we can tell
[47:15] whatever seal is and we can tell
[47:16] whatever vial is or we can tell whatever
[47:18] that's just being able to read right
[47:21] but when you put this thing in here yeah
[47:25] brother Brown said he's got to come off
[47:26] these pages and come in here before you
[47:28] repeat the devil you can't defeat to
[47:30] that one by reading it to him right
[47:31] right did you see where Keith was was
[47:33] preaching Sunday where and Jesus and I
[47:36] showed him one point which is in the
[47:37] Book of Luke the first time that Satan
[47:39] comes to Jesus Jesus said it is written
[47:41] right right did Satan move
[47:44] stayed right there didn't he yeah second
[47:47] time Jesus said it is written
[47:49] Satan stayed right there
[47:51] the last thing Jesus said he said it is
[47:54] said
[47:56] and when he said it said the Bible says
[47:58] Satan left him right see it's written as
[48:01] long as it stays on the page right it's
[48:03] just somebody saying just some
[48:04] somebody's saying what somebody else
[48:05] said but when he said it is sad glory in
[48:08] other words when he became what that was
[48:10] Lord he became what that was he spoke to
[48:12] him he said it says
[48:14] Thou shalt not have no other gods or in
[48:15] other words you know
[48:17] um have any other gods worship any other
[48:20] God Satan had to leave when he said it
[48:22] it said but when it was written he could
[48:24] stay right there right when it's written
[48:25] he can stay right there right same thing
[48:27] in justification Satan's gonna stay
[48:28] right around you because he don't want
[48:29] you to realize that you're in a that
[48:32] you're in a position to move toward God
[48:34] because we know God does the calling we
[48:37] know God does all that but we got to
[48:38] make a move amen you got to make a move
[48:41] right so move his faith right you got to
[48:44] step out on faith and say God I believe
[48:46] that's what you've done to me right
[48:47] what's in the Bible not what a prophet
[48:49] said or not what this one said but take
[48:51] the Bible and read the Bible a newborn
[48:53] Christian ought to read the Bible
[48:55] that's true that's right amen but if you
[48:58] can understand the Bible then you'll
[48:59] definitely go to the prophet's message
[49:01] and see where there's a love letter in
[49:03] between those lines
[49:05] God's trying to tell you hey I want some
[49:08] more right of you right that's right I
[49:11] want to give you more of me
[49:13] and it's right here right some people
[49:16] have put me in a written word which is
[49:18] fine but I want to make that word
[49:20] disappear in here amen and then come
[49:23] alive all right and that's where it is
[49:24] going to be a life live if we don't live
[49:27] that life people we are missing it
[49:28] brother Brown said it's in the walk it's
[49:30] in that life that we live and I know we
[49:33] all have problems but we got to start
[49:34] cutting these things out that's actually
[49:36] a perfect man is a honing time amen get
[49:40] the rough edges off all right we all got
[49:42] rough edges but we got to we got to bind
[49:44] together
[49:47] all right all right let's go acts 13 38.
[49:51] be it known unto you therefore men in
[49:53] Brethren
[49:54] that through this man this is Paul
[49:56] through this man has preached unto you
[49:58] the Forgiveness of sins and by him all
[50:02] that believe are Justified from all
[50:04] things
[50:05] you read that from all things from which
[50:09] you could not be justified by the law of
[50:12] Moses exactly so you can't be justified
[50:15] by do's and don'ts right
[50:19] you can't be justified by the law
[50:21] because the law says you are condemned
[50:23] right right
[50:24] you are condemned you are condemned you
[50:27] are condemned you are condemned do this
[50:28] don't do that that's what Rome picked up
[50:32] that's what the Roman Catholic Church
[50:34] picked up as far as do's and don'ts
[50:36] that's why Martin Luther had to walk
[50:38] down and say hey that's not what the
[50:40] Bible's saying right the Bible's saying
[50:42] the just the just shall live by faith
[50:45] right not by work exactly but worse goes
[50:48] along with it like I said we're going to
[50:49] read it later
[50:50] all right now let's go to
[50:52] Romans
[50:54] three I love the book of Romans if you
[50:56] want to talk about justification amen
[50:58] read Romans 3 Romans 4 and Romans five
[51:00] and we're gonna read part of it here but
[51:02] let's break it down a little bit Romans
[51:04] 3
[51:05] four
[51:07] and five so let's start right here at
[51:08] Romans three
[51:13] and I really like what what brother
[51:15] baseball said about Abraham
[51:17] he kind of held the book The Bible
[51:20] I can't do it with mine because it's
[51:22] about to fall apart I gotta get another
[51:23] one here pretty quick
[51:25] but uh
[51:26] that means it's been used
[51:28] a little but he takes that part right
[51:31] there where it says New Testament and he
[51:33] held that up and I'm not going to do it
[51:35] with mine because it'll fall apart he
[51:36] held that up and he see what I mean and
[51:39] he um he held it up and he said now what
[51:42] got what what the Bible says about
[51:43] Abraham is over here
[51:46] he lied give his wife away
[51:49] done all those things right but when you
[51:51] look through to the New Testament
[51:53] when you look through the blood look
[51:55] through the end of the New Testament all
[51:58] that got left behind right yep right
[52:01] and over here we're going to read that
[52:03] he staggered not at the promise of God
[52:05] through faith he did all these things he
[52:07] did all these things right why he went
[52:10] through the blood right God had to come
[52:12] into a new testament the Old Testament
[52:13] couldn't do it for him man it had to be
[52:15] a new testament it had to be it had to
[52:17] be the word of God Written in Blood
[52:20] written in his blood right
[52:23] to even make the Old Testament Justified
[52:26] right all right
[52:28] because Abraham wasn't just doing what
[52:30] he done
[52:32] but but in in Abraham's walk what does
[52:35] brother Branham attribute justification
[52:37] to
[52:38] Abraham getting up and starting his walk
[52:40] right
[52:41] there in about 12 to 14 somewhere in
[52:44] that 15. he says Abraham got up God said
[52:47] hey come I need you to go well he did
[52:50] come and he did go but what he done he
[52:51] didn't do all what God told him to do he
[52:53] said I want you to get up and walk with
[52:55] me right he brought his uncle and his
[52:58] father and his
[53:00] whoever lot was his cousin God didn't
[53:03] tell him to do that but see we do that
[53:04] in justification because we don't really
[53:06] understand God at this time right
[53:09] right God tells us to come to church he
[53:10] tells us to do the things to pay our
[53:12] time to to do the right things in life
[53:14] but there's a lot of other things that
[53:16] we do sure
[53:18] because in sanctification see that
[53:20] starts washing away that starts going
[53:23] away from me at sanctification but in
[53:26] justification you still you got a lot of
[53:27] baggage Abraham a lot of time out of
[53:29] baggage right
[53:30] you slowed him down right that's what he
[53:33] was God said hey come up I want you to
[53:35] take a journey so he goes and gets a lot
[53:36] and the lights always they're always
[53:38] dividing stuff up and they're always
[53:39] talking about God didn't want that God
[53:41] wants you to walk straight down that
[53:43] line amen all right so now let's look at
[53:46] Romans this I love Romans like I said
[53:48] three four and five
[53:49] if you want to read about justification
[53:50] and know
[53:52] where and how justification works in
[53:54] your life read Romans three four and
[53:57] five amen now we know
[54:00] that what thing so ever the law saith
[54:03] it say after them that are under the law
[54:06] if you're not born again you're still
[54:08] not at all if you're Justified you're
[54:10] still under the law yeah all right
[54:12] because it is a little bit it is do's
[54:14] and don'ts we're going to read what
[54:15] James says but you got to believe
[54:17] somewhere that God has done something in
[54:19] your life and you're going to move amen
[54:21] that every mouth may be stopped
[54:24] and all the world
[54:26] may become guilty before God right
[54:29] that's not what we want
[54:32] because listen
[54:33] even in a Justified condition if you
[54:35] were to die you're going to go to heaven
[54:37] but you still got to go and walk before
[54:39] that white Throne judgment and give an
[54:40] account and for example one little thing
[54:43] and you missed it that's why I'm born
[54:45] again born again is in the Judgment not
[54:48] being judged right right all right but
[54:50] you're if you're Justified or if you're
[54:51] Sanctified and you die you'll be given
[54:54] eternal life that's what the prophet
[54:55] said because you got your passing you're
[54:57] in a walk of God God understands where
[54:58] you're going to be and where you're not
[54:59] going to be all right but you're gonna
[55:02] have to stand before that judgment right
[55:03] there and all the world is guilty before
[55:05] God right all the world
[55:08] all right therefore by the Deeds of the
[55:11] law there shall no flesh be justified in
[55:15] a sign right amen for by the law is the
[55:18] knowledge of sin I did this I did that I
[55:22] cursed right I run around with women I
[55:24] smoke I drink I did these things but now
[55:26] the righteousness of God without the law
[55:28] is matter of fact
[55:30] being witnessed by the law and the
[55:32] prophets they spoke of something to come
[55:34] even the righteousness of God which is
[55:37] by what faith of Jesus Christ
[55:41] he raised for our justification we
[55:45] didn't raise for it he raised to justify
[55:47] me and you even the righteousness of God
[55:50] which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
[55:53] all and upon all them that believe
[55:57] for there's no difference amen
[56:00] for all of sin and come short of the
[56:03] glory of God right he's Paul's lumping
[56:06] everybody in in this in this problem
[56:08] here exactly but look being justified
[56:11] freely
[56:13] by his grace
[56:15] through
[56:17] the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[56:19] you believed him you believed that's
[56:22] what he done and God has set forth to be
[56:25] a perpetuation through faith in his
[56:28] blood right
[56:30] not faith in this and that and the other
[56:32] faith in his blood that that man was God
[56:35] Almighty and he died for your sins to
[56:38] declare his righteousness for the
[56:40] remission of sins that are what passed
[56:43] there's justification sins that are
[56:46] passed right
[56:47] through the forbearance thank God God Is
[56:50] forbearing Right Through the forbearance
[56:53] of God to declare I say
[56:56] at this time his righteousness not not
[56:58] polished
[56:59] that he might be just and to justifier
[57:03] of him which believeth
[57:06] in Jesus man there's your justification
[57:09] he's just laying it right down right
[57:11] very simple
[57:13] Blair is boasting then
[57:16] all right job was boasting I've done
[57:18] this I haven't done that I I'm this I'm
[57:20] that I'm the other
[57:21] where is boasting then it's excluded
[57:24] right right by what law of Works hey
[57:28] but by the law of Faith man
[57:31] therefore we conclude I like Paul
[57:34] because he brings it right now he brings
[57:36] it a funk it's a big old funnel then he
[57:38] brings it right down to a point right
[57:40] therefore we conclude in other words the
[57:43] conclusion of all this that a man is
[57:45] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[57:49] the law man do this don't do that is he
[57:52] the god of the Jews only
[57:54] is he not also of the Gentiles yes of
[57:57] the Gentiles also seeing is one God
[58:00] which shall justify the circumcision by
[58:03] faith and the uncircumstances look at
[58:06] the difference
[58:07] he's going to justify the circumcision
[58:10] by faith right
[58:12] which was who the Jews yeah right they
[58:16] were the circumcised we were there
[58:17] uncircumcised and the uncircumcision
[58:20] through faith we got to believe that
[58:23] that happened exactly do we then make
[58:25] boy to law through faith God forbid that
[58:27] we're not we'll see that hey there you
[58:29] go you you can't do away well I don't
[58:31] have to worry about the law anymore no
[58:33] the law is always there right okay but
[58:36] through faith do we void the law through
[58:38] faith God forbid yeah we established a
[58:41] law right listen folks people talk about
[58:44] ten commandments we're the only people
[58:46] if you're born again tonight you're the
[58:48] only person that is able to live the Ten
[58:50] Commandments amen right so we're the
[58:52] only ones able to live the law right we
[58:55] are
[58:56] right we are the only ones that can live
[58:57] the law exactly because somewhere else
[58:59] you can't live the law if you're not
[59:01] born again do we then make boy the law
[59:03] through faith God forbid
[59:05] we established the law right right all
[59:08] right let's go to Romans 4. now look
[59:12] if you look in your Bible Romans 3 runs
[59:15] right down and I read the last scripture
[59:16] Romans 4. he just continuing his thought
[59:18] man put that 4-1 remember when the Bible
[59:21] was written it was written just
[59:22] continuous right
[59:25] man put the chapters in there right we
[59:27] broke them up in chapters so this is
[59:29] Paul this is his thought continuing
[59:31] what shall we say then that Abraham go
[59:35] back can you go back one brother Joe my
[59:37] brother Anderson
[59:40] no don't go back
[59:44] 331. go back to 331 yeah the scripture
[59:47] before or no
[59:48] just reverse it go back to the scripture
[59:51] we were just reading
[59:55] all right go on
[59:57] no go
[1:00:00] to Romans 3 19 through 31. yeah the one
[1:00:04] we were just on
[1:00:05] because I want to read I want to read
[1:00:07] there you go right there I knew you
[1:00:08] could do that
[1:00:09] seeing it as one God but shall justify
[1:00:11] the circumcision by faith in the united
[1:00:13] circumcision to Faith I want you to see
[1:00:14] what Paul's thought is do we then make
[1:00:16] boy the law through faith God forbid we
[1:00:18] establish the law just scroll up
[1:00:21] because his thought just continued in
[1:00:23] Romans 4 just keep going to Romans 4.
[1:00:25] what shall we say then
[1:00:27] did Abraham our father has pertaining to
[1:00:29] the flesh has found right
[1:00:31] for If Abraham would Justify both works
[1:00:33] now what do you talk about before you
[1:00:34] just continue to install it for If
[1:00:36] Abraham were justified by words he have
[1:00:38] to wear off the glory right I did this I
[1:00:41] didn't do that
[1:00:42] but not before God for what saith the
[1:00:45] scripture Abraham believed God and it
[1:00:48] was counted unto him for righteousness
[1:00:50] that's what Abraham did he just believed
[1:00:52] God he got up and started walking he was
[1:00:55] just in what he was doing right now to
[1:00:57] him that worketh is the reward not
[1:00:59] reckoned of Grace but of death if you
[1:01:02] just knew by words work it but to him
[1:01:04] that worketh not but believeth on him
[1:01:07] that justified the ungodly his faith is
[1:01:10] counted for righteousness right so Paul
[1:01:12] that's why everybody thinks Paul's
[1:01:14] kicking works out the door and bringing
[1:01:16] faith in and and James is kicking Faith
[1:01:19] out the door and bringing Works in no
[1:01:21] we're going to show our faith by our
[1:01:24] works amen all right we're going to show
[1:01:27] what we believe right
[1:01:29] we're going to show What We Believe by
[1:01:32] The Works that we do man right actually
[1:01:33] right whether you like it or not we're
[1:01:35] going to show what we believe the only
[1:01:37] way we can show what we believe is by
[1:01:39] this guy right here right black brother
[1:01:41] Keith is talking about the only way
[1:01:42] God's going to be manifest is by this
[1:01:44] right here right he's going to work
[1:01:46] through us he's not coming down beside
[1:01:47] of us and he's not coming over here for
[1:01:49] us to look to describes no
[1:01:52] it's crashed in you that's right the
[1:01:54] hope of glory all right now to him that
[1:01:57] worketh is a reward not reckoned of
[1:01:59] Grace but a debt back to him that work
[1:02:02] is not but believeth on him that
[1:02:04] justifyeth it ungodly his faith is
[1:02:06] counted for righteousness so it's not
[1:02:09] then Paul's saying I mean he's saying
[1:02:11] it's not all works you got to have faith
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] because by your work shows your faith
[1:02:16] right and if you have faith you'll have
[1:02:19] work Glory right right right you have
[1:02:22] faith you're going to have work right
[1:02:23] even as David also describeth the
[1:02:26] blessedness of man unto whom God imputed
[1:02:29] righteousness without works remember
[1:02:30] Davidson blesses the man who God will
[1:02:32] not impute sin right well that's what
[1:02:34] Paul is kind of showing you what he was
[1:02:35] really saying even as David also
[1:02:38] described the blessedness
[1:02:39] of the man unto whom God impedeth
[1:02:42] righteousness will not work right saying
[1:02:45] blessed are they whose iniquities are
[1:02:47] forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:02:49] blessed is a man to own the Lord will
[1:02:52] not impute or count right or put to your
[1:02:55] account sin right all right now let's
[1:02:58] continue to go to Romans 4 25 we took a
[1:03:00] little bit out of this but look Abraham
[1:03:02] staggered not he said he staggered not
[1:03:04] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:03:07] now when we look back on the account
[1:03:10] we say there's part of the account says
[1:03:12] that he did stagger yeah
[1:03:14] laughed at God give his wife away looks
[1:03:16] like he really didn't do a whole lot but
[1:03:18] look through the blood coming over on
[1:03:20] this side that he was strong in faith
[1:03:22] well you know what even though Abraham
[1:03:23] did all that stuff God counted his faith
[1:03:26] yeah as righteousness right not his work
[1:03:30] but his faith because he wasn't born
[1:03:31] again
[1:03:32] born against when you put the works and
[1:03:34] the faith together right right right
[1:03:36] because they did a lot of Works in
[1:03:38] David's time David was one of them too
[1:03:40] kind of a rascal but he wasn't born
[1:03:42] again right amen but he was just then
[1:03:45] that God said hey that guy is my guy if
[1:03:49] he would be in the New Testament he'd be
[1:03:52] a lot better off but he's not in it he
[1:03:54] become an example in the Old Testament
[1:03:56] but if you brought David and give him
[1:03:58] the new birth he wouldn't act like he
[1:03:59] did that's right right but so then it is
[1:04:02] David what he done but if you come over
[1:04:04] here works and Faith's got to be
[1:04:05] together amen you can't be born again
[1:04:08] and have a different kind of work
[1:04:10] amen ain't gonna happen
[1:04:12] because by your faith you're going to
[1:04:14] show your words like we're going to show
[1:04:15] in a minute
[1:04:19] yeah go to Romans 5 1. therefore
[1:04:22] this is the keep him coming down
[1:04:25] who was delivered for our fans now look
[1:04:27] and therefore it was appeared in Verizon
[1:04:28] this now it was not written for his sake
[1:04:30] alone and it was imputed to him in other
[1:04:32] words written for us but us also to whom
[1:04:35] it shall be imputed or counted if big
[1:04:39] word if we believe on him that raised up
[1:04:42] Jesus our lord from the dead who has the
[1:04:44] who was delivered for not his offense
[1:04:47] but our offense yeah
[1:04:49] and was raised again
[1:04:51] prior justification he was raised one
[1:04:54] time physically right
[1:04:57] prove who he was right remember he
[1:04:59] proves who he was when he raised from
[1:05:00] the dead
[1:05:01] but he's got to raise again in me and
[1:05:03] you for our justification we gotta
[1:05:06] accept that and it become part of us all
[1:05:08] right Romans 5 1 therefore
[1:05:12] being justified by faith
[1:05:15] we have peace with God
[1:05:17] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] amen amen
[1:05:23] now let's go to Galatians 2.
[1:05:26] knowing that a man is not justified by
[1:05:29] The Works of the law
[1:05:31] but by the faith of Jesus Christ now
[1:05:33] this Paul's continuing the thought
[1:05:34] counter but he's over in Galatians now
[1:05:36] giving you just a little bit different
[1:05:38] angle
[1:05:39] through the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:05:41] spirit's kind of showing you he's giving
[1:05:42] you no loophole to get through as far as
[1:05:44] works and Faith they've got to work hand
[1:05:47] in hand
[1:05:48] knowing that a man is not justified by
[1:05:51] The Works of the law
[1:05:53] can't be
[1:05:54] remember we said he born under the law
[1:05:56] born in sin Shaker than iniquity but by
[1:05:59] the faith of Jesus Christ even we have
[1:06:01] believed in Jesus Christ
[1:06:03] that we might be justified by the Faith
[1:06:06] of Christ and not by The Works of the
[1:06:08] law for by The Works of the law shall no
[1:06:10] flesh be justified amen
[1:06:12] but if
[1:06:15] listen if while we seek to be justified
[1:06:19] by Christ in other words what we're
[1:06:21] moving we're looking right we ourselves
[1:06:23] also were found sinners
[1:06:25] is therefore Christ the minister of sin
[1:06:27] no not forbid
[1:06:30] God forbid if you look you're looking
[1:06:32] for Christ you're going to see your sins
[1:06:34] but he don't right right
[1:06:36] for if I build again the things which I
[1:06:40] destroyed
[1:06:42] I make myself
[1:06:44] a transgressional
[1:06:48] if I go back
[1:06:50] and do the same old thing right
[1:06:52] if I if I build again the things which I
[1:06:56] destroy now you can't destroy them on
[1:06:58] your own but you see what Paul's saying
[1:06:59] I
[1:07:00] myself
[1:07:01] a transgressor it's got to be by faith
[1:07:05] in Jesus Christ
[1:07:07] all right Galatians 3.
[1:07:10] for as many as are of the works of the
[1:07:12] law are under the curse
[1:07:15] and that's right
[1:07:17] for it is written cursed is everyone
[1:07:19] that continuous not in all things which
[1:07:22] are written in the book of the law to do
[1:07:24] them
[1:07:24] but that no man is justified by the law
[1:07:27] in the sight of God it is evident right
[1:07:29] four one the just show me a buffet right
[1:07:33] are you getting anything here the judge
[1:07:34] the Justified the just people shall live
[1:07:37] by faith
[1:07:39] Galatians 5. Christ is become of no
[1:07:42] effect unto you whosoever of you are
[1:07:44] justified by the law right
[1:07:46] you're falling from Grace
[1:07:49] wow that's pretty stout right Christ is
[1:07:53] because of no effect unto you whosoever
[1:07:55] of you that are justified by the law
[1:07:57] right
[1:07:58] do this don't do that year falling from
[1:08:01] Grace
[1:08:02] for we through the spirit wait for the
[1:08:06] hope of righteousness by faith right
[1:08:08] right in other words we walk through
[1:08:10] justification we walk through
[1:08:11] sanctification we walk we're waiting on
[1:08:14] that spirit amen amen repent and be
[1:08:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:08:18] the mission of your sins and you shall
[1:08:19] receive the gift shall receive the gift
[1:08:22] of the Holy Ghost for that promises to
[1:08:24] you and your children them that are far
[1:08:25] off and even this morning many as the
[1:08:27] Lord Our God shall call for we through
[1:08:29] the spirit wait for the hope of
[1:08:30] righteousness by faith all right
[1:08:33] let's go right here first Corinthians
[1:08:38] oh let's read this one Galatians 5 this
[1:08:40] is coming down further but if you buy
[1:08:42] and divide one another
[1:08:44] take heed that you be not consumed one
[1:08:47] of another right
[1:08:48] this I say then walk in the spirit
[1:08:51] and you shall not fulfill the lusts of
[1:08:53] the flesh
[1:08:54] play for the flesh left this against the
[1:08:57] spirit
[1:08:58] and the spirit against the flesh there's
[1:09:00] the warring
[1:09:01] and these are contrary one to the other
[1:09:04] so that you not can do the things that
[1:09:06] you would right
[1:09:08] right but if you be led of the spirit
[1:09:10] amen you're not under law right that's
[1:09:12] right now the words of the flesh are
[1:09:14] manifest which are these adulting
[1:09:16] fornication uncleanness let's save
[1:09:18] additionally going down through there
[1:09:19] right
[1:09:22] are all these now look let's go to First
[1:09:25] Corinthians

[1:09:33] the kingdom of God right now stop right

[1:10:14] and if he had not stopped if he'd have
[1:10:16] stopped right there when he said in such
[1:10:18] for some of you we'd be in trouble
[1:10:21] and sex for some of you right right

[1:11:38] if they're Justified right
[1:11:40] people
[1:11:46] that doesn't mean that's not the sweet
[1:11:48] little lady walking down the street that
[1:11:50] you know that
[1:11:51] in other words let's just put it in 2011
[1:11:53] 2012 language that's not somebody flips
[1:11:56] you off on the side of the road
[1:11:57] for passing them or cutting them off no
[1:11:59] these people are in trouble right
[1:12:02] these people are in real trouble
[1:12:04] look at it thieves come with this
[1:12:06] drunkards revilers
[1:12:09] adulterers a feminate abusers of himself
[1:12:12] with mankind pretty right people
[1:12:16] but you're washed
[1:12:19] amen that's why when you get baptized in
[1:12:21] the Lamb of Lord Jesus Christ and you
[1:12:23] really believe that God forgive you your
[1:12:25] sins Glory right there everybody let me
[1:12:27] tell you something that scripture is now
[1:12:29] of non-fact to you yeah
[1:12:34] that sucks for some of you right but
[1:12:37] you're washed amen you're Sanctified
[1:12:39] amen you're justified in the name of the
[1:12:42] Lord Jesus and by the spirit glory amen
[1:12:45] amen is that scripture
[1:12:47] then we ought to just absolutely just we
[1:12:50] ought to shout the house down for the
[1:12:51] Justified people amen because God's not
[1:12:54] a word that's a big work in your life
[1:12:56] man then you walked in God and I hope to
[1:13:00] God and ain't if you get if you get
[1:13:02] Justified at 40 years old I hope you
[1:13:04] don't wait another 40 to get Sanctified
[1:13:06] all right
[1:13:08] you should be a little quick short short
[1:13:10] work in between all those right because
[1:13:12] if you wait four more years you got 40
[1:13:14] more years of sin piled up again all
[1:13:16] right all right so let's go through
[1:13:18] justification let's go through
[1:13:19] sanctification
[1:13:20] realizing that God's done something in
[1:13:22] our life right all right now
[1:13:25] let's go to James
[1:13:27] let's read James
[1:13:30] because here is another angle for some
[1:13:32] of you that that are that are looking in
[1:13:35] in at the Bible and that are walking in
[1:13:37] justification
[1:13:39] it says now what you've said brother
[1:13:40] wait is that all we got to do is have
[1:13:42] faith all we got to do is have faith all
[1:13:45] we got to do is have faith and all we
[1:13:47] got to do is have faith just have faith
[1:13:48] don't worry about the works all we gotta
[1:13:50] do is have faith that's correct because
[1:13:51] if you have faith you'll have works
[1:13:53] right because like I said before exactly
[1:13:55] they will come it's an attribute
[1:13:58] of being justified
[1:14:00] his Works an attribute of being
[1:14:02] Sanctified is the works you do all right
[1:14:05] because remember
[1:14:06] brother Brown when he brings
[1:14:08] justification and sanctification down in
[1:14:10] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:14:12] the snuff box don't go out at the Holy
[1:14:14] Ghost the stuff those box go to that
[1:14:15] sanctification right that's where people
[1:14:17] are getting a role right well I don't
[1:14:19] cuss anymore because I'm born again no
[1:14:21] you shouldn't cuss because you
[1:14:22] Sanctified it right
[1:14:24] right vacation takes care of that junk
[1:14:25] right was not Abraham Our Father
[1:14:28] justified by works
[1:14:31] because what did he do God said go take
[1:14:33] Isaac
[1:14:34] up to the mountain and kill him right
[1:14:37] right
[1:14:38] well it's not Abraham Our Father
[1:14:39] justified by works but what happened
[1:14:42] with Abraham's works
[1:14:44] Abraham's faith
[1:14:47] got him through that right right he
[1:14:50] believed and told the people he said the
[1:14:52] boy and I will return exactly there's
[1:14:55] Faith right that's calling see to me to
[1:14:59] me dad that's where that's where the
[1:15:01] realm was was produced exactly they just
[1:15:04] went up there and it was made manifested
[1:15:05] right but the something else was
[1:15:08] produced as a substitute when he spoke
[1:15:10] he said me in the lab will come back
[1:15:12] right here exactly that's right see we
[1:15:16] think well we got to get right there to
[1:15:17] the spot and there was the realm no that
[1:15:20] land that Ram was produced when Abraham
[1:15:22] said man the last because something he
[1:15:25] was taking that boy up there to kill him
[1:15:27] right right he was taking that boy up
[1:15:29] there to end his life there's no way
[1:15:30] that boy would walk back down off that
[1:15:32] mountain with Abraham if he did what God
[1:15:34] told him right right but when Abraham
[1:15:37] told him said told those people as a
[1:15:39] witness remember buy your words
[1:15:41] by your words you'd be justified by your
[1:15:43] words Abraham told him said me and the
[1:15:46] boy are going up and me and the boy are
[1:15:48] coming back right
[1:15:49] what's right right there produced The
[1:15:52] Ram amen because something had to become
[1:15:54] a substitute from here to there and back
[1:15:56] right right so when he got there he
[1:15:59] still was going to do the deed but God
[1:16:01] stopped him and said Abraham I know
[1:16:03] right amen I know well God knew it
[1:16:06] already he just wanted Abraham to know
[1:16:08] right right he want Abraham knows this
[1:16:11] again God knows all things but he wants
[1:16:13] you to know right that he's weaving his
[1:16:15] way through your life that's why in
[1:16:17] justification is not something you it's
[1:16:19] not just a numb feeling you just sat
[1:16:21] around no you get up and go do something
[1:16:22] right he told Abraham to get up and go
[1:16:24] Abraham got up and went exactly right
[1:16:26] Abraham didn't have a seal book stayed
[1:16:28] with him he didn't even have a prophet
[1:16:30] to tell him anything right he just heard
[1:16:32] a voice right
[1:16:35] come on people he just heard the voice
[1:16:37] he didn't hear 12 sermons right he heard
[1:16:39] a voice Abraham get up you're going to
[1:16:42] be the father of many nations you go and
[1:16:43] you start walking right he just gotta
[1:16:45] win well that's where Abraham was
[1:16:47] accounted now was not Abraham Our Father
[1:16:50] justified by words
[1:16:52] when he had offered Isaac his son upon
[1:16:53] the altar
[1:16:55] see it's loud how Faith wrought with his
[1:16:58] worth with his words see his faith went
[1:17:02] with his works right he went with it
[1:17:04] right right see how Faith was wrought
[1:17:07] with his works and by works
[1:17:12] let's contrary to what Paul's talking
[1:17:14] about
[1:17:16] brother Chris by words was his faith
[1:17:19] made perfect asking a question
[1:17:22] see see us now how Faith wrought with
[1:17:25] his Works in other words they work
[1:17:26] together
[1:17:27] and by works his faith
[1:17:30] was made perfect because when he went up
[1:17:32] on that mountain don't you think Abraham
[1:17:34] takes his only son he takes Isaac
[1:17:37] that's the promised son
[1:17:39] takes him up on the mountain to kill him
[1:17:41] right
[1:17:42] if something don't happen if God don't
[1:17:45] come on the scene that's the end of that
[1:17:47] promise right that's why I said when
[1:17:49] Abraham said the boy and I'll return he
[1:17:51] produced his faith produced but his
[1:17:53] words had to take him to it right he had
[1:17:55] to actually go up there and he didn't I
[1:17:57] don't believe he went Lord
[1:18:00] come on God no no
[1:18:03] Abraham God knew Abraham in his mind
[1:18:05] said God if that's what you told me to
[1:18:07] do here and he went right at right at
[1:18:09] the throat right and that angel said
[1:18:12] nope hang on a minute right hey Grandma
[1:18:15] no now right well
[1:18:17] Abraham's Faith was made Strong by that
[1:18:19] don't you think if I was a man Brother
[1:18:22] Richard if I was a man and known that
[1:18:24] God told me to take my only son but
[1:18:25] that's my promise son and he spared that
[1:18:28] guy from death
[1:18:30] and then produce a ram to sacrifice
[1:18:32] right yeah walking down that mountain
[1:18:35] buddy Abraham was skipping and jumping
[1:18:37] and hopping he was the happiest guy in
[1:18:40] the world not that not only that his son
[1:18:42] was spared but that he knew he was
[1:18:44] walking right in the will of God amen
[1:18:46] amen he within his faith was made
[1:18:49] Stronger by his words right and by works
[1:18:53] was Faith made perfect you got to do
[1:18:56] something you can't just sit around
[1:18:58] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:19:00] says Abraham believed God
[1:19:03] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:19:04] righteousness and he was called the
[1:19:06] friend of God see he's not even called
[1:19:07] son God because he wasn't born again
[1:19:09] called a friend of God right
[1:19:11] right you see then how that by works a
[1:19:14] man is Justified and not by faith only
[1:19:18] because they go together right all right
[1:19:21] likewise also was not Rahab the Harlot
[1:19:23] justified by works
[1:19:25] she was she received the two spies she
[1:19:29] said spies I'll I'll get you out of here
[1:19:33] and had sent them out another way
[1:19:35] remember she got them and said hey if
[1:19:36] they're fixing to do something do you
[1:19:37] guys go out this way
[1:19:39] all right she was justified by works for
[1:19:43] as the body without the spirit is dead
[1:19:46] so faith without works exactly it's dead
[1:19:49] also so faith without works is dead
[1:19:52] your faith is going to produce the worst
[1:19:55] Abraham's Faith at the bottom of that
[1:19:57] mountain produced that lamb that Ram
[1:19:58] yeah right right that's what you've got
[1:20:01] to produce now let's take it in 2012
[1:20:03] what brother Dale's been talking about
[1:20:04] your faith
[1:20:06] has to produce that lamb me man
[1:20:09] your face right
[1:20:11] your faith Keith said Sunday
[1:20:15] right you say right to this mountain
[1:20:17] Laura you say to your children you say
[1:20:20] to your finances you say that he named
[1:20:22] all that off right
[1:20:24] you say
[1:20:26] then your faith your faith and works
[1:20:29] have to go together amen you can't say I
[1:20:32] have great faith
[1:20:33] and not have Works to go with it exactly
[1:20:36] your work say brother Brown had great
[1:20:37] faith but look at the works right his
[1:20:41] Works proved his faith amen all right
[1:20:43] same way with Abraham same way with me
[1:20:45] and you know let's go to the next one
[1:20:47] let's go to Hebrews 10. listen to this
[1:20:50] but we have need of patience
[1:20:52] that after
[1:20:55] that after ye have done the will of God
[1:21:00] you might receive the promise
[1:21:03] for yet a little while and he that shall
[1:21:05] come will come and will not carry
[1:21:07] now the just shall live by faith amen
[1:21:10] but if any man draw back
[1:21:13] my soul shall have no pleasure
[1:21:16] in him right
[1:21:18] you won't get to New Birth because
[1:21:20] that's the soul of God exactly no words
[1:21:23] that just shall live by faith it's a
[1:21:24] walk but if any man draw back
[1:21:28] fall back draw back right God's drawing
[1:21:32] us up not backwards
[1:21:34] now to just shall live by faith but if
[1:21:36] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[1:21:38] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[1:21:40] who draw back unto Perdition right but
[1:21:43] of them that believe to the savings
[1:21:46] right of the Soul amen right to the
[1:21:49] saving of the Soul all right now I want
[1:21:53] to read
[1:21:54] I don't think we have it up here I think
[1:21:56] that's the last one let's turn to
[1:22:02] Corinthians
[1:22:07] I thought I'd have time to read it so I
[1:22:09] didn't put it in
[1:22:12] and then put it in the uh
[1:22:17] well
[1:22:18] in a minute
[1:22:21] the baptism scripture
[1:22:23] I got it real down somewhere you know
[1:22:25] man
[1:22:29] Romans six thank you
[1:22:32] Romans 6. now let's just read this is
[1:22:35] the baptism scripture you've heard it
[1:22:36] read by Brother Dale and myself and I
[1:22:39] believe this is truly what it is I want
[1:22:41] you to look I should read this Romans 6
[1:22:43] 1.
[1:22:49] what shall we say then shall we continue
[1:22:51] in sin
[1:22:53] that Grace May abound that's right how
[1:22:56] you going to get Grace on seeing them
[1:22:59] right God forbid
[1:23:01] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[1:23:04] any longer therein right
[1:23:07] know you not that so many of us as we're
[1:23:09] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:23:12] into his death right therefore we are
[1:23:15] buried with him by baptism into
[1:23:20] Christ was raised up from the dead when
[1:23:22] we put them in the we put them in the
[1:23:24] water we bring them back out all right
[1:23:26] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:23:28] the glory of the father even so we also
[1:23:31] should walk in newness
[1:23:33] just a new life amen
[1:23:35] amen it's going to be a struggle there's
[1:23:37] not going to be a flower bed of these
[1:23:39] but it shouldn't be a newness of life
[1:23:41] you're going to feel
[1:23:43] um uh even from my own experience when I
[1:23:45] came out of the water I I just grabbed
[1:23:47] you and we hugged each other for you
[1:23:49] know I don't know how long it was but
[1:23:51] but
[1:23:52] it was just like there was a shell there
[1:23:57] everything that I had inside of me
[1:23:58] brother Chris was gone it was it it was
[1:24:00] in that water right and thank God
[1:24:02] they're building a bridge over that
[1:24:03] thing right now yeah
[1:24:06] I mean I love the baptize out there at
[1:24:08] that place I remember
[1:24:10] um brother Dan I was thinking about it
[1:24:11] the other day they cut that big old tree
[1:24:12] down where we baptized these what
[1:24:14] they done they're gonna put a new bridge
[1:24:15] there but they cut that tree down
[1:24:17] Brother Dean said he said I believe
[1:24:19] those angels and I believe they did they
[1:24:20] were sitting they were they sat on that
[1:24:22] tree yeah he said well you crazy well
[1:24:24] that's what I liked it to be crazy right
[1:24:27] they were sitting in that tree watching
[1:24:29] that baptism service amen Amber baptism
[1:24:31] service we did there was an angel
[1:24:32] sitting in that tree watching because
[1:24:34] it's a witness right you got a witness
[1:24:36] in heaven and earth right both both
[1:24:38] Heaven and Earth you got to be a witness
[1:24:40] but they shall walk in newness of life
[1:24:42] when I came out of the water it was just
[1:24:44] like honestly that uh there was nothing
[1:24:46] inside of me it was just empty amen and
[1:24:49] I was waiting for God to fill me up all
[1:24:50] right for if we have been planted
[1:24:53] together
[1:24:55] gotta plant them to see it grow right
[1:24:56] you gotta put seed in the ground floor
[1:24:58] to grow
[1:24:59] for if we have been planted together in
[1:25:01] the likeness of his death which is going
[1:25:04] down then we shall also in the likeness
[1:25:07] of his resurrection
[1:25:09] knowing this that our old man is
[1:25:12] crucified with him
[1:25:14] let the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:25:17] now Jesus didn't come up an old man
[1:25:19] right
[1:25:20] he came up in newness of life he had to
[1:25:23] change the body
[1:25:25] knowing this that our old man is
[1:25:26] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:25:28] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[1:25:30] should not serve sin
[1:25:32] for he that is dead
[1:25:35] it's free from sin amen can't accuse a
[1:25:38] dead man or nothing right now if we be
[1:25:40] dead with Christ
[1:25:42] we believe that we shall also live with
[1:25:45] him all right well that's a powerful
[1:25:47] scripture right
[1:25:49] if we be dead with Christ we believe
[1:25:51] what is belief Faith amen amen we have
[1:25:54] faith that we shall also live with him
[1:25:56] amen he said where I am there should you
[1:25:58] shall be also knowing that Christ being
[1:26:00] raised from the dead dies no more you
[1:26:03] don't have to go back and die again it
[1:26:04] doesn't have to get on the cross
[1:26:07] death have no more dominion over him
[1:26:09] he's done right he's finished that's
[1:26:13] what we got to believe in right for him
[1:26:15] that he died he died unto sin one time
[1:26:18] once amen but in that he liveth he
[1:26:20] liveth unto God likewise Rick and you
[1:26:23] also yourselves to be dead indeed into
[1:26:25] sin unto sin but allow them to God
[1:26:28] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:26:31] let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:26:33] mortal body in other words rain means
[1:26:35] Dominion right right let it not have a
[1:26:37] dominion over your mortal body right
[1:26:39] amen are you going to have problems I
[1:26:41] I was the sickest I'd ever been in my
[1:26:43] mortal body after that but so what
[1:26:46] right big deal
[1:26:49] I'm fine now right but your body even
[1:26:52] like you know doing the things I did I
[1:26:54] believe there's a there's your body
[1:26:57] doesn't go through an instant change you
[1:26:58] know many of you I told that that I used
[1:27:00] to chew the back and I did it for years
[1:27:02] and dipped snuff until until the very
[1:27:04] night I came up here on Wednesday night
[1:27:06] brother Chris I huge never smoked much
[1:27:09] but a chewed and and dip
[1:27:12] tobacco for years 20 years I guess or
[1:27:15] more
[1:27:15] but when I came right here that night I
[1:27:18] gave it to God
[1:27:19] and he give it back to the devil amen
[1:27:21] because the next morning I didn't want
[1:27:23] no more you can't do that
[1:27:25] physically you can't do that right you
[1:27:28] can't do that God's got to do that but
[1:27:30] he knew that thing bothered me so bad
[1:27:33] that he got rid of it for me because I
[1:27:35] sure didn't I did not ask Don I said I
[1:27:37] didn't say God take away this this
[1:27:39] desire of the of the tobacco no in my
[1:27:42] heart I knew that I had been changed
[1:27:44] amen and and then he started to work
[1:27:46] from that from the inside and like I've
[1:27:49] told you many times that even in my
[1:27:51] born-again experience I used to I used
[1:27:53] to say bad words a lot of bad words many
[1:27:55] bad words totally bad bad words all the
[1:27:58] time
[1:27:59] and uh
[1:28:00] God just took that away from me tell you
[1:28:02] man I mean there was no desire of that
[1:28:04] was that one time I was talking on the
[1:28:06] phone to no friend
[1:28:07] and I started to say the word AWS and it
[1:28:10] was just like it looked like somebody
[1:28:11] punched me right here and if you get hit
[1:28:13] right here you don't want them to do is
[1:28:14] I blocked the breath out of them and I
[1:28:16] went
[1:28:17] and never said the word and the guy on
[1:28:19] the phone he said what happened to you I
[1:28:20] said oh don't worry
[1:28:22] you wouldn't understand
[1:28:24] but and that's the only time I've come
[1:28:26] close to that because there's something
[1:28:28] that stops me because in my mortal see
[1:28:31] let's not sin therefore rain it's going
[1:28:35] to be there
[1:28:36] but don't let it rain rain means to rule
[1:28:39] and have dominion yeah don't let
[1:28:42] something have dominion in your mortal
[1:28:43] body get rid of it that you should obey
[1:28:46] it in the lust thereof in other words
[1:28:49] you like it that's what a lot of people
[1:28:50] have Devils you know brother Brown said
[1:28:52] that man that that was going to kill him
[1:28:54] remember the man up in Alberta or
[1:28:56] somewhere was going to kill him come up
[1:28:58] on the platform the guy you know he cast
[1:29:01] The Demon out but if you'll realize
[1:29:03] later on brother random said that man
[1:29:04] somebody asked him about that man I said
[1:29:06] oh he's in the same shape he wasn't
[1:29:07] right why he loved that devil he petted
[1:29:10] it and let that devil come right back
[1:29:12] right and that's a lot of our problems
[1:29:14] right right we get these Devils cast off
[1:29:16] by the word of God and you know what we
[1:29:19] we Pat them back yeah come on back you
[1:29:22] want scripture for that
[1:29:26] yeah let me give you scripture for it
[1:29:30] what about if a man if the unclean
[1:29:31] Spirit goes out of a man
[1:29:33] he walks in dry places right she can
[1:29:36] rest and findeth none right he comes
[1:29:38] back finds the vessel swept and
[1:29:40] garnished in other words
[1:29:42] stuff got rid of but he comes back and
[1:29:44] you don't close the door
[1:29:46] he'll walk right back in and bring seven
[1:29:48] of his buddies right a lot worse than
[1:29:50] what you were before because he'll make
[1:29:52] you a religious person then yeah
[1:29:55] neither yield ye your members as
[1:29:57] instruments of
[1:29:59] but yield yourself
[1:30:01] brother Brown safety stands you give
[1:30:03] money away he said do the vice versa
[1:30:05] right well if you got a problem with
[1:30:07] women
[1:30:08] look up
[1:30:10] I'm like when I told Richard Marlo he
[1:30:14] had a problem with that I know he don't
[1:30:15] mind me coming and he and I said
[1:30:17] something from the pulpit one day and he
[1:30:19] said it really helped him because we all
[1:30:21] have a problem with that women are the
[1:30:23] most beautiful people in the world now
[1:30:24] even
[1:30:25] even a 10 year old beautiful you have to
[1:30:28] watch these things right do you know
[1:30:29] what goes through my mind death yeah
[1:30:32] that is death right don't touch it right
[1:30:35] that is death leave it alone I don't
[1:30:37] care how pretty how enticing how
[1:30:40] beautiful that's death right right don't
[1:30:42] touch it is death it will kill you so
[1:30:45] when I say that then it kind of just it
[1:30:47] kind of backs that Spirit off a little
[1:30:48] bit because you know as well as I do the
[1:30:51] difference in us being a a sinner and
[1:30:53] being a Christian is when we were a
[1:30:55] sinner we invited that feeling in right
[1:30:58] we invited all that to come into our
[1:31:00] life we invited the it didn't matter if
[1:31:02] we picked up the cigarette it didn't
[1:31:03] matter if we I mean it was just second
[1:31:05] nature to go buy skull and buy red man
[1:31:07] it just wasn't I mean just like me and
[1:31:09] you going to buy a milk and bread yeah
[1:31:10] why Coastal Spirits were connected
[1:31:14] but once that unclean Spirit was driven
[1:31:16] out right
[1:31:17] you did you knew that was that was a hot
[1:31:20] wire don't touch that thing anymore all
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:23] Polaris there is works and faith has got
[1:31:25] to go together
[1:31:27] go back to what we're talking about with
[1:31:28] James your your faith in your works if
[1:31:30] you got faith in something but you still
[1:31:32] do it I don't have doubt you got faith
[1:31:33] right
[1:31:35] right I'm sorry
[1:31:37] see if I were if I were to tell you that
[1:31:39] that I cussed all the time and I still
[1:31:43] have problems with it
[1:31:45] come on people
[1:31:47] that's not a part of me right that's
[1:31:49] dead that's what he said there's got to
[1:31:51] be a it's got to be dead amen all right
[1:31:53] right not divorced right not suppressed
[1:31:57] right dead where it may come here but it
[1:32:00] doesn't come here
[1:32:02] you can't help the pretty women here but
[1:32:03] you used to yield to that yeah
[1:32:06] it wasn't death
[1:32:08] it was enticing oh yeah reading Tyson's
[1:32:11] spirits
[1:32:12] you'll get a lot of goodness good out of
[1:32:14] that neither yield yourself yield you
[1:32:17] your members and as if as instruments of
[1:32:19] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:32:21] yourself unto God as those that are
[1:32:24] alive from the dead right
[1:32:26] and your members as instruments of
[1:32:29] righteousness unto God for sin shall not
[1:32:34] have dominion over you now that's a
[1:32:36] pretty powerful script right percent
[1:32:37] shall not
[1:32:39] have dominion over you for you are not
[1:32:41] under the law but under grace amen
[1:32:44] all that Paul said about the law
[1:32:48] now look
[1:32:49] we're under the law sold under the law
[1:32:52] sold and sin but now if sin has no more
[1:32:54] demand
[1:32:55] you're not under the law but under grace
[1:32:57] gracious took over and covered the law
[1:33:00] that's right all right What then shall
[1:33:02] we sin because we are not unlawed but
[1:33:04] under grace God forbid right let's don't
[1:33:07] go over on one side with its name all
[1:33:09] right that's what he's saying right God
[1:33:12] forbid in other words he's saying you
[1:33:13] know what he's doing he's picking the
[1:33:15] holy spirit is picking up the thoughts
[1:33:16] of the people he's going to read this
[1:33:17] yeah
[1:33:20] that's what I'm saying Paul upon his tab
[1:33:22] to all the Christians he's writing it to
[1:33:24] the Romans he said What then shall we
[1:33:25] sin because we are not on the law but
[1:33:26] under grace the Holy Spirit would know
[1:33:28] that we'd be going
[1:33:30] really and then you say God forbid and
[1:33:32] you shake yourself and say okay God
[1:33:33] forbid I'm not going to think that
[1:33:34] anymore know you not that to whom you
[1:33:37] yield yourself servants to obey his
[1:33:39] servants ye are to whom you obey
[1:33:43] deserve sin then you're what sinner
[1:33:46] weather of sin unto death or of
[1:33:49] obedience unto righteousness but God be
[1:33:52] thanked
[1:33:53] that you were the servant you were the
[1:33:55] Servants of sin but you have obeyed from
[1:33:58] the heart right that form of Doctrine
[1:34:05] which was delivered you
[1:34:07] by some preacher by somebody witnessing
[1:34:10] to you the life has to come through the
[1:34:11] body but thanks be to God that you are
[1:34:13] the servant that ye were the Servants of
[1:34:15] sin right but you have obeyed from the
[1:34:18] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[1:34:20] delivered you being then made free from
[1:34:22] sin you became the Servants of
[1:34:24] righteousness I speak after the manner
[1:34:27] of men because of the infirmity of your
[1:34:29] flesh he knew we were human for as ye
[1:34:32] have yielded your member service
[1:34:33] uncleanness into iniquity unto iniquity
[1:34:36] even so now yields remember to
[1:34:39] righteousness under Holiness we used to
[1:34:41] waste our time and iniquity we used to
[1:34:44] waste our time doing things wrong now
[1:34:45] let's turn our time to God for when you
[1:34:49] were the servant of sin you were free
[1:34:51] from righteousness
[1:34:53] because you were serving sin right right
[1:34:55] what fruit had ye then in those things
[1:34:59] where are you are now ashamed right
[1:35:03] let me read that again what fruit had
[1:35:06] you been in those things whereof you are
[1:35:08] now
[1:35:09] a shame right
[1:35:11] for the end of those things is death
[1:35:13] right
[1:35:14] but now being made free from sin
[1:35:17] and become servants to God you have your
[1:35:20] fruit unto a holy man and the end the
[1:35:24] everlasting life for the wages of sin is
[1:35:26] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:35:29] life
[1:35:30] through Jesus Christ Our Lord right you
[1:35:33] love the Lord amen amen and we ought to
[1:35:35] love him more Glory more we're going to
[1:35:38] love him more we are loving more because
[1:35:40] the wages of sin is death what is Wages
[1:35:42] payment right the payment of sin is
[1:35:45] death
[1:35:46] we're dying mortally anyway people
[1:35:49] we're trying to stop the death it Reigns
[1:35:52] in our members right in our inside
[1:35:53] person yeah but the wages of sin is
[1:35:55] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:35:57] life amen through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:35:59] if you're a new Christian or if you're
[1:36:00] if you think that that you're in a in a
[1:36:03] Justified condition
[1:36:04] thank God Amen
[1:36:07] he thought enough he called you first
[1:36:09] right Glory yeah he called you amen but
[1:36:13] now if he called and he probably and I'm
[1:36:16] like that
[1:36:17] God called because the Bible says many
[1:36:20] are called right right
[1:36:24] um
[1:36:25] men are called if you're chosen right
[1:36:29] God probably called a lot of people and
[1:36:31] Noah's time right God probably called we
[1:36:35] think see we we thank brother Chris that
[1:36:37] we just say well God just asked Abraham
[1:36:39] no Abraham was the only one that
[1:36:41] accepted what God said exactly
[1:36:43] right right because God's got God's not
[1:36:46] a respecter of persons so there's no way
[1:36:48] God could say well I'm going to choose
[1:36:50] Abraham because he's so good and I want
[1:36:52] you to know he can't do that
[1:36:54] right so he called many are called he
[1:36:56] called out
[1:36:58] and Abraham responded yeah
[1:37:01] when Abraham responded God said that's
[1:37:03] my man right
[1:37:04] that's what I'm going to use right same
[1:37:07] way with you when God called you if he
[1:37:09] called you and you go through to
[1:37:12] a Christian Life that he called you for
[1:37:14] a life of service right
[1:37:16] doesn't matter if you sit on the Pew and
[1:37:18] pay your time we need it all right
[1:37:21] right we don't need it God don't need it
[1:37:23] but you know to produce our all right
[1:37:25] the things keep the light bill and stuff
[1:37:27] and things on we have to do things like
[1:37:29] today but if God chose you and you
[1:37:31] accept it
[1:37:34] Brother Gary that's the Almighty
[1:37:37] the one that said let there be and and
[1:37:39] go stand outside and look up at the
[1:37:41] stars
[1:37:43] hope the same person that said that
[1:37:46] the same person that just said let there
[1:37:48] be any just all these and we're trying
[1:37:49] to we're trying to keep this one world
[1:37:51] going straight and he just he's got the
[1:37:53] whole universe just working yeah
[1:37:56] right because when he said something
[1:37:58] it's Eternal right and it just they can
[1:38:01] send them to Mars and like brother Quinn
[1:38:02] said or whoever he was said stupid this
[1:38:04] thing they ever done went to you know
[1:38:06] putting spaceships on other planets
[1:38:09] God's got all that working yeah but he
[1:38:13] made all that just for me and you all
[1:38:15] right that's right he made all that just
[1:38:17] so he could bring somebody down here and
[1:38:19] say
[1:38:20] Abraham get up and walk right right
[1:38:22] that's right Noah believe my message
[1:38:27] it's going to rain because see nobody
[1:38:30] knows they believe it was going to rain
[1:38:31] because the Bible said that they
[1:38:33] couldn't find any any rain anywhere
[1:38:35] right the the ground the water came up
[1:38:37] from the ground the Miss from the
[1:38:39] grounds what watered everything no such
[1:38:40] thing as a cloud no such thing as rain
[1:38:42] that's why it was so weird David it
[1:38:44] wasn't just that it rained every day or
[1:38:46] they had a monsoon season it never
[1:38:47] rained right right for 120 years a man
[1:38:51] stood and preached to a civilization
[1:38:53] more advanced than ours
[1:38:56] because the Bible said as it was in the
[1:38:58] days of Noah so shall be in the days of
[1:38:59] the son of man so they were just as
[1:39:01] advanced as we were right and he walks
[1:39:04] up and says
[1:39:05] it's gonna rain
[1:39:06] and it's going to destroy everything on
[1:39:08] the earth yeah you need to believe what
[1:39:10] I said and let's build this art
[1:39:13] eight people
[1:39:15] out of seven billion yeah if it's the
[1:39:18] same as it was then right eight people
[1:39:19] out of seven billion are the only ones
[1:39:21] that heard 120 years of preaching right
[1:39:26] 120 we think we preached a long time
[1:39:28] we've been here a long time what if
[1:39:30] brother if it's 120 years probably
[1:39:33] they'd only be about eight people ready
[1:39:34] to go right but for 120 years God
[1:39:38] preached threw up no it's going to rain
[1:39:40] it's gonna rain it's gonna rain you know
[1:39:41] what one day rain right right but Noah
[1:39:44] believes what God told him there was his
[1:39:47] faith in what God Said
[1:39:49] then his Works was he built an art now
[1:39:52] what if Noah was to say God I believe
[1:39:54] you
[1:39:55] I'll start on that Ark tomorrow
[1:39:57] God I believe you I'm starting that art
[1:39:59] tomorrow
[1:40:00] God I believe he's almost strong at ARK
[1:40:02] tomorrow I'm gonna take a vacation and
[1:40:04] I'll start after I get back off vacation
[1:40:05] right
[1:40:06] no Noah believe what he said right and
[1:40:10] he didn't have a Bible he didn't have a
[1:40:11] prophet he didn't have a church age book
[1:40:13] or a syllable in other words he didn't
[1:40:14] have anything external like we do we've
[1:40:17] got all this stuff at our disposal he
[1:40:19] didn't have nothing but just Faith he
[1:40:20] just believed I think that's what we
[1:40:22] need to get back to like Keith was
[1:40:24] saying have faith have faith and believe
[1:40:26] what God's already said about us right
[1:40:28] everything's open to us now
[1:40:31] it's done it's finished the Ministries
[1:40:33] are all history there's no Mysteries
[1:40:35] listen
[1:40:37] I I promise you if you just listen and
[1:40:41] let God talk to you let God talk to you
[1:40:44] through somebody and have faith right
[1:40:47] then he'll answer
[1:40:50] I just believe amen he'll answer
[1:40:53] everything that we ask for understand
[1:40:57] he'll answer it
[1:40:59] all those people downstairs you know
[1:41:01] they're right here actually

[1:42:35] this whole world
[1:42:39] you'll be justified and by your words
[1:42:42] you'll be condemned glorious so we need

[1:42:52] your heart to say something say it my

[1:43:03] every Sunday morning now I don't
[1:43:04] physically read every one of them all
[1:43:05] but I just look at that board and I say
[1:43:08] man if those 80 people were to come back
[1:43:09] to the Lord now we would have to have
[1:43:11] two services or stack them up on top of
[1:43:13] each other yeah
[1:43:14] but you know why you say oh that's silly
[1:43:16] we're supposed not supposed to do that
[1:43:23] let's believe and then see what the
[1:43:26] works that's produced from the faith
[1:43:28] that we have right
[1:43:30] let's just see wait and see let's see in
[1:43:33] the red book hey Jade in the red book
[1:43:36] less worship God
[1:43:48] good morning
[1:44:02] Tina
[1:44:14] sizing
[1:44:20] ready
[1:44:56] for me
[1:45:14] please
[1:45:16] foreign
[1:46:29] it out
[1:46:31] we should have seen
[1:46:53] us
[1:47:37] a faith Builder but but when God's never
[1:47:40] done anything to me it's just been it's
[1:47:43] just been quiet it's been something that
[1:47:45] that God's done for me in my life and
[1:47:47] and most people don't even know a thing
[1:47:49] about it that's the way I like for God
[1:47:51] to deal when when brother uh billions
[1:47:54] was here remember he stood right here in
[1:47:55] front of this pulpit
[1:47:57] music
[1:47:58] there was no singing right people just
[1:48:01] came up
[1:48:02] and whispered their requests and now the
[1:48:04] old Bill Yachts would have shouted and
[1:48:06] screamed around the person
[1:48:08] but he just laid hands on this
[1:48:10] thing whatever your simple prayer was
[1:48:12] exactly and I believe prayers were
[1:48:13] answered right yes we don't we don't
[1:48:15] sure it builds our faith to do that but
[1:48:18] but like I told Susan what she needed I
[1:48:20] said we just don't want that no more you
[1:48:23] just don't want it no more I don't want
[1:48:25] it leave it put it out here put that
[1:48:27] thing out here don't you say look Satan
[1:48:29] I don't want I don't want him have
[1:48:30] nothing to do with that I don't want
[1:48:31] that because it's going to come
[1:48:36] all adversity and all this Gonna Come
[1:48:39] but you just put a distance between you
[1:48:41] and it just say hey
[1:48:42] would we read the scripture get away
[1:48:44] from it resist the devil and help me
[1:48:47] from you so resist means to do this when
[1:48:49] we were Sinners it was
[1:48:51] this
[1:48:53] right but as Christians we've got the
[1:48:56] power right right Powers the spoken word
[1:48:59] of God Amen amen born again or not even
[1:49:01] just Justified condition folks we've got
[1:49:04] power because God has chose you to do
[1:49:06] something to him he's Justified you I
[1:49:08] wanted to get that down in your mind God
[1:49:10] has absolutely took all that stuff out
[1:49:12] of your life right now he's not took it
[1:49:13] out of your life as far as that point
[1:49:15] forward but from that point back if you
[1:49:17] were a whoremonger you're not a
[1:49:19] whoremonger no more right amen
[1:49:22] beware sinner you're not a sinner
[1:49:23] anymore
[1:49:25] no more right
[1:49:28] oh I wish you could see that amen
[1:49:30] justification is not just some little
[1:49:32] simple baby step
[1:49:35] it's something God's done that that he's
[1:49:38] not going to do for about seven billion
[1:49:39] other people yeah
[1:49:41] because they're not going to accept it
[1:49:43] right right
[1:49:44] but you know what just as just as the
[1:49:46] same as they don't accept him we don't
[1:49:50] have to accept the devil right that's
[1:49:51] right we don't have to accept it
[1:49:54] Hannah told us years ago about her
[1:49:56] situation about being gay and all this
[1:49:57] stuff I said I'm not accepting that
[1:49:58] right I don't care what happens to her
[1:50:00] I'm not accepting that amen all right
[1:50:02] there's no accepting that there's not a
[1:50:04] place for that in me there's not a
[1:50:06] there's not a doubt in my mind that
[1:50:08] God's Gonna Savor that's right man not a
