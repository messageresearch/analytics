TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hour but by my spirit said the lord it's not by my mind and it's not my power but by my spirit said the Lord in this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed by my spirit said the Lord sing it like this in your mountain in your Mountain shall be removed your Mountain shall be removed your Mountain shall be removed by my spirit said the Lord Jonas you want to help us take a bathroom then when Jonas comes up if the Bonnet family can come sing they're special but they just didn't think for our transformed we given for our Centennial nucleus but and let us have good church service today and bless the ties and often and let you know prayer requests in Jesus Christ name amen that's just sing that chorus again as they're come up in your Mountain shall be removed your Mountain shall be removed [Music] shall be removed by my spirit said the Lord and this mountain in this mountain shall be removed this mountain shall be removed the move this mountain shall be removed by my spirit said the Lord [Music] foreign God bless you all um quick little word here about the uh the PowerPoint is going to be projected has the lyrics so you can help us sing but also in the background you'll see the pictures of our testimonies over the years that my family and I have been through a lot that the Lord has uh been there for us and that's what this song is about that God is with you in the fiery trials and there's some pictures in their Bible scenes but most of them or at least half of them are family going through trials and the Lord's been there for us and just to explain what some of those are if you don't remember the um Goliath tree that I testified about that was a big hundred foot tall Hickory that was threatening to fall in our house years ago and I spoke to the tree and said when you fall fall this way and later on the storm came and it felt exactly that way and Gabby was also testifying to the kids that it would fall away from our house and also pictured in there of Ava and Eula with the seizures they had and how the Lord was there for us during that time there's also a picture of the uh the map the storm the tornado kind of map I guess you call it where in Kentucky a little over a year ago we were there during all those tornadoes and they were all around us people were dying I was laying their sleep I didn't even know so the Lord protect us and all that and then some other pictures in there the most important lesson I learned from that trial with Ava I think when she was dying at three days old is that um not to question God where are you at because that was the last time I ever said that I said God where are you at I knew he was real I knew he's been with us but it's like things were happening that seemed like he was just letting it go on and didn't we didn't sense his presence there so even when you don't know the Lord's there he's with you forgot forgot my pick I got that [Music] okay [Music] there's a Grace [Music] there's another in the fire standing next to me [Music] should I ever meet there is a cross that bears the burden another day for me there is another in the fight [Music] anymore [Music] I know I'll never be alone fire s sent us to [Music] do this is [Music] whoa there's another in the fire oh there is [Music] beneath us [Music] there is no other name but the name that is Jesus [Music] through it all I know I'll never be alone I know I'll never be alone there is holding back the Seas [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] that was wonderful it's uh I mean it's nice when you give it that that extra extra zazz I guess you could say yeah those little slides and you know I couldn't help to think you know brother Ryan he always mentions his daughter always mentions this the testimonies it's almost like he's told the Lord Lord as long as I live I'm going to always testify these are blessings those are blessings for him and his family he has the right to testify and thank God Amen do we thank him that way you know that we thank him enough we got so much to thank him for all right praise the Lord sister Lily we'll go you want to sing tonight okay come on I'm not sure uh because the Barnett's family was the one so that I had on the list so but if you prepared yourself that's fine um I didn't write it down I keep forgetting but if everyone could keep my sister Rebecca in their prayers um she originally was having a lot of pain a few months ago and um thought it might have been a hernia but she went to the doctor um found out it was swollen lymph nodes and so she got a biopsy I believe Monday and they said it she thought it was just one but then they told her it could be four to five swollen lymph nodes and they said it could just be an infection but it could be lymphoma so they tested her and they um she said she doesn't know when she'll get the results back but um we believe in miracles foreign not to cry now we are still standing on holy Holy Ground [Music] and I know that there are angels all around let us pray Jesus now [Music] we are standing in his presence [Music] this is Holy Ground and we're standing on Holy Ground for the Lord is here and where he is his whole holy [Music] this is Holy Ground [Music] we're standing on Holy Ground [Music] for the Lord is here and where he is is Hol y we are still Sunday ending on holy grass [Music] all around [Music] let us pray [Music] Jesus now [Music] let us pray Jesus now [Music] let us pray Jesus now for we are standing in his presence on hold [Music] let's just continue seeing that is where the weight comes we are staying and they are no Holy Ground [Music] and I know that there are angels all around so Let Us Praise [Music] Jesus now [Music] sing it to him oh we are standing in his presence [Music] thank you Lord [Music] and I know [Music] you believe that tonight you didn't come here by yourself [Music] for we are standing in his presence [Music] Amen brother Ram said it wasn't the mountain it was holy it was the people on the mountain so if it's Holy Ground is because you're standing on it man you love the Lord good to be back good to be uh good to be here with all of you again one more time in the house of the Lord we had a wonderful time and in Ohio we got to get a little surprise snow uh for the wedding some of you saw those pictures but hey two inches of snow to them is it's like a good rain down here they don't stop for anything so we appreciate them and thank you for praying for us remember the prayer service will be this coming Saturday at seven o'clock no Bible study put prayer service from seven to whenever the doors will be open at seven and we will uh I'll have prayer service for the coming youth service in a couple of weeks that will be on March the 18th um brother Jack Duffy's he's excited to come he hasn't seen us in a long long time and I don't think he's ever been here to preach but he really uh reveres brother Dale in his ministry and uh uh I appreciate the opportunity to come so we're going to have him do our youth service at three o'clock on Saturday on March the 18th and then he'll be preaching one service for us on Sunday so just keep that in your prayer keep all the sick uh this that's um home and and coughing and hacking and the ones here too um we're just going to pray that the Lord will take that away and uh I think one thing's for sure I think maybe back in the 70s or early 80s um somebody came out with a with music on the television it was called MTV we got message television MTV you've started something brother right now I guarantee you somebody else is going to pick that up and they gonna have the have the message television I don't mind them that other mess that's outside I don't want them but to have something like that for an impact to show that there is another in the fire there's somebody there to stand with you the Fourth Man In The Fire And that's a little bit kind of what we're going to still get on to tonight is justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word so it's four the number four is not bad when you when you put it to the Earth to Redemption because everybody knows there's one thing for sure we want and have to be redeemed we want to be redeemed we don't there is not a I was looking up the word just a minute ago I I've been talking about a plan and you got a plan God's Got A Plan brother Adam said God had a plan and a purpose a plan is a method of achieving an end he said oh well I don't mean God yeah he this thing's going to end let me tell you something sin's got an expiration date amen this worldly knowledge all your sickness all your sorrow all your pain all everything you got has an end amen yeah well give me one give me come on give me one to God but sin has an expiration date just think about that but you don't ain't God don't he never has any never will God said it and that's the way it's going to be like I said many times before if God loved you in the beginning bro George he's got to still love you because he can't change his mind he has no ups and downs you and I have the ups and downs but there is a method or a plan of achieving that end what the end of all things the end of all things here for us to go and bring Glory into view and bring the Eternal part to all of us even to the Earth all right I like that a plan is a detailed formulation of a program of action God formulated a program and it's not going to change it was the perfect one to begin with we've just got to do what connect ourselves to it we don't connect ourselves to it we're not part of the plan we got to become part of the plan by the new birth so that we can even understand this thing called a plan and a purpose amen so let's um let's bow our heads and I know we all have uh requests on our heart let's pray for these ones that are really sick um I really I really burden in our heart when we started hearing today of all the ones that were sick and couldn't get here tonight we uh we appreciate the ones that we did and we're going to pray now for the ones that can't and we're going to pray that everything will be fine they'll be back on Sunday so let's pray dear Lord thank you for this evening that you give us Lord in the middle of the week Lord just give us a Rejuvenation of of in our spirit realm Lord father we know that the soul is set on fire by the new birth and it's continually burning but our spirit needs a little bit of extra Lord our merry reason conscious effects and Imagination should be turned towards you Lord and we'll give you Lord to praise and honor and glory for this whole service we yield ourselves to you Lord and we pray that you would just bless us now as a congregation Lord be with the ones that are sick that can't be with us tonight Lord the ones that are watching in Lord thank you so much for technology that we can get to the ones that want to sit and listen and hear about you father we ask you forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord that we make to sanctify us for this journey or this plan that we're talking about Lord keep us clean because we know there's one thing for sure Satan wants to dirty everything he can but father you gave us clean water you gave us washing of the Water by the word and that word's what's going to keep us clean if we'll just attach ourselves to it father I pray now that you should be with us in the further minutes of service in Jesus name amen we're on son of man part 91 in the beginning was the word where was with God the Word was God and that word was made flesh there had to come a time when God father Jehovah Elohim um theophany God had to become flesh because he couldn't know how that we live without him living with us all right but he dwelt with us and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth we saw did you see it no but we saw by the eyes of faith we see by Matthew Martin Luke and John we see by all the disciples and all the ones that wrote down what Jesus acted like when he was on the earth and that's what we have to do is act according to that full of grace and truth II Peter 1 5 would try to get to patience tonight just have patience please and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to verse your knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience and the patience godliness in Luke 21 19 Jesus tells us is in your patience in your patience possess ye your soul you may be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word in your patience possess you your souls but it's going to take us a time because that plan any good plan has a beginning and any good plan has an end and then all way in between that might be sometimes that in a football plan they formulate a plan and they're like this is what's going to happen and we're going to run the ball because they're not going to be able to stop us and and then they get up to about the second quarter brother George and they can't run two yards the defense has John picked up on what they're doing and they have to what change their plan but God doesn't do that God's not wanting to get in the middle of the plan and say oh sorry we'll go this other way no this is his plan what we have to do as human beings is we have to get into that plant all right we don't have to just listen to it we have to be a part of that plan because the plan and purpose was what us to go back to the Garden of Eden condition that's what we're looking at now and only by the word of God can we do that oh by the way brother Tim said to tell you thank you for the weekend um I think yesterday or day before we uh we convert uh text each other and he said he really had a good time and I appreciate it I watched a good bit of most of it not all of it yet but good bit of it and then he did a good job he's grown a lot in Grace and knowledge himself he's got a little bit bigger too Bliss it's hard I'll tell him that's what I see so anyway you can tell him if you've seen first okay but let's pull his heart up and we're all getting that way June and I are on Weight Watchers now so we're gonna we're gonna start lifting some weight bless our heart I'm not gonna be like bro Dale always said about Aaron said you're just going to be hard to Rapture because there's a lot of you to rapture you know so oh I'm sorry you're supposed to look like this way you turn like this and you look like the rest of them but as I said before our soul is redeemed our soul is that's the firing mechanism that even it'll fire you in faith and it fires you in doubt in other words you're moving and breathing and looking and and conversing and listening all by your soul that's the real you the real you is the soul not the spirit the real you is the soul now the soul then what it goes and it this the soul is the nature of the spirit so whatever that nature shows in the spirit realm is what you have in your soul all right but we still have problems we still have our own ideas our own wants our own things in the spirit realm to where God can uh use your imagination and so can Satan God can use your conscience and so can the devil but God can't use your soul and Satan use it too you're either born again or not in your soul so there's Faith or doubt that's it there's no gray area there there is a walk in the Lord through justification and sanctification but when you get to sanctification if you stop there that unclean spirit is going to go right back in that little hole right here it's going to go right back in that little hole right there and it's going to make you worse because it's going to give you a religious spirit then all this is going to act religious that's why brother Brown said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day in your life on your spirit realm right here and dying go to hell because that man right there is one that's going to be judged not this guy and not this guy you're not going to be judged your flesh is not going to be judged the Bible says the soul that sinneth it will surely die all right so that's what we're looking at so we're out in the spirit realm now this is the statue of perfect man I wanted you to kind of back up just a minute now let's look let's think about the other day that's your walk with God we know that but that is the absolute um characteristics of Jesus Christ his Spirit was the Holy Spirit so now what's happening to me and you is that Holy Spirit has went into our soul to give us a new birth make us God made manifest in another form make us the word made flesh and then we have because of our carnal nature our imagination conscious memory reason and affection is working against us contrary the Bible says to God now you were contrary to God in your soul but now let's we're born again all right we're born again we have the fire of God listen we got the Fourth Man in the fire he's not just in there with us he's inside of us all right and it's burning and it should be able to to uh display itself a little bit more we just need to let it out somebody ought to say that and then into our spirit realm is where this is going to be working all this we've already been Faith virtue and up to knowledge when I look at we'll look at something and just a minute about knowledge we've got to have knowledge that this thing's right we got to have the knowledge of God that this thing I say this thing this message the the plan that we see see there's a plan out in the denominational World they have a plan but their plan is to go to judgment their plan is to go to seven years tribulation their plan is I ain't perfect you ain't perfect their plan is follow us on the Holy Ghost as a way to baptize but that's not the plan of God that's the plan of the devil but they're what they're accepting that plan because sometimes they don't even know any different I was talking to a couple of people in Ohio just coming into the messaging and some had been away from the message of one brother and he's coming back and there's a lot of questions I I can't stand in my righteous indignation I guess where you've got ministers and preachers that that if somebody is a little bit different in your church they just throw you out y'all been gone a long time ago that's what brother Dale said and Aaron said amen we're all different but being a being the economy of God we have differences we have differences of spirits we have not not Spirits as far as out there but spirit of discernment Spirit of Faith Spirit of speaking in tongue Spirit of interpretation Spirit of wisdom like we've been speaking before their Spirit of wisdom to come into the church we'll talk about that maybe a little bit more I want to break this down a little more in knowledge because if we don't know that we know that we know if we don't know that this is it nothing else this is it there's no other message coming there's no other method or no other plan this is it and if we don't get into it we're out of it just like the Inside Man Faith or doubt that's it and that's the plan of God is what to get you born again and then add to your new birth our Minister nourishment as we as brother Tam was speaking this weekend you know bringing the the Believers in and all the different things there's a lot of people believe a lot of things but there's got to be true believers because I'll promise you a good Catholic a good Catholic will fight you because they believe what they believe but remember the prophet of God said you can be sincere but you can be sincerely wrong well now listen we can't plead that ignorance here we can't pleading the ignorance in this message we've got the truth and the Bible says the truth will set you free why is it binding people why is it making people have problems and issues and all these things can't get to church can't do this can't do this can't do that have you ever thought about this I'm gonna go ahead and say I got it at the end of the sermon but you know we talk about all this we talked of it before about how your confession when you confess something you know in the Old Testament the high priest would take the blood and every that iPod or that um Thomas had all 12 tribes all 12 Stones was on that was on that birthplace so what he was doing is one man was walking into the holy of holies representing Natalie Levi all the different ones he was taking that in and representing every one of them for their sin and he was doing the confessing for the people not every you understand what I'm saying everybody from Nepali might have had this might have been a drunk this would have been whoremonger this would be this this would be that he'd have to list that in the Old Testament the requirement was that he would go in and say lord god Jehovah I have done here seven times what you told me to do and now we are doing everything you said now I am going to go tell the children of Israel when you like when that thing lights up and you accept that blood he's going to walk out and say for one more year you're forgiven so he was the high priest of their confession not knowing every confession they had but he confessed that he had all 12 tribes and he brought them in under the blood and then he give it to God and said God you said this was going to be enough to cover their sin for one more year and God says I accept that because that's the way it was in the Torah when I told Moses to do what he's doing right what about me and you the high priest Caiaphas and all the different ones Aaron they weren't saved they were only confessing what you said Jesus can't be no different if you ever thought about this if you confess God is your high brief that takes that confession and takes it to God and says God you said if I would die for these people we know they're not two different people but I'm we're in an act of a play all right he takes those sins and he takes them before the father and he says they have confessed their sin they have confessed that by my stripes they were healed you said that you said you would heal them you said you would save them we haven't High priests as the Bible says they can go before God with a confession now do you know what he can't do I can't go past that you're perfect man I don't know what you're talking about I don't I don't know I can't get this I can't go to church I get all these problems and I got bills and I got this I got that you know Jesus Christ almighty God himself cannot take that confession to God ah he never will take a negative confession to the father come on people good Lord now stop then stop confessing negative stop it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you're standing there with one day left to live I still say Jesus Christ you said you would heal me please take that to the father and We Know listen we know it's not trinitarianism but it is a way of getting to God right only way to the white father is through Jesus Christ so Jesus Takes your confession you know what he can't go and do say one thing you if you say something negative he can't take that to the god to God to the father he's the high priest though of your confession you confess I confess that we can make it up this statue of perfect man I confess that these things are working in our church they're working in our life they're working in our ministry they're working in our job they're working in our families I can see it working but what do you confess ah just wowzy wowzy woo Jesus Christ has never took wow as you woo to the father amen think about that next time we start [Music] what I always call it being bucket mouth you know get a little bucket and fill it full of Just Junk don't be bucket Matthew God can't he can only go by your confession think about that he cannot take a negative confession to God I can't never has went before the father now I can't went from you to Jesus Christ but he's never took that confession to the father so who stopped it Jesus no you did you stopped it this is not the power of positive thinking this is what God told us to do he said come bowling before the throne of grace he said I am the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities that knows that he was one-time Spirit God that could not feel pain but he became a human so that he can feel pain he became the son of man so he could die for me and you he became the son of man so he could take the stripes for me and you and he could take the nails and he could die for me and you amen so let's quit doing this negative stuff your confession will never go to God negative confessions never will make it to God praise the Lord one day y'all gonna get happy about stuff and I hope it just don't just explode and brother Brown tells us let's continue on but that's that's what we're looking at all right look our soul that's the ark that's where that's where what was in the ark what's in that art the word of God the word of God in two tables of stone were placed in that Ark and that's what God would you had to go into that Ark spread the blood sprinkle the blood and then that's how you talk to God not you but the high priest talked to God is through that art because it was whatever God put in there remember we went to it before the word of God the rod that budded and something else was in there I can't remember them but oh the shoe bread so that was all what God Said to put in there he put it in there Aaron and whoever the high priest said well I'm going to go in and this is what you told me to do Lord if you told me to do this you'll forgive their sins well let's do the same thing Jesus Christ you told me you'd forgive me of my sins Jesus Christ you told me you would heal me you told me you'd deliver me you told me you would help me up to Statue of perfect man now I take that before the father oh you take that before the father and let him confess a positive confession so now let's get started everybody with me positive confession they'll be all right with that think about that we stop our own self we know that but in that analogy you see how you stop yourself why am I not getting anything you're not approaching right your approach is not right to God all right let's go to let's go here and look at this they got it over there okay I won't need the chart anymore if you want to pull them back up over there we appreciate everybody in the back doing their job and the ones that are standing in for the ones that are not here tonight we really appreciate that now what was brother Ryan we talked about this plan the prophet of God what was he here to do and here brother Brown didn't come to make a bride there's bride down through the church ages many many more that's going to be in the message brother Brown didn't come to tell us that there's a new way again born again he come to tell us what the word said straight out of God's mouth is what he come to tell us and then we keep getting out of line and these as we see this analogy for brother Romans and our analogy it's a vision that he saw that they were doing good you know the first group came by then the middle group came by and the middle group was just naked and and prancing around the worldly church and he was like oh my God is this all I've done is this all I've got but the angel says look that bride's going to come back again in the end time in other words he's coming she's coming in the end time as the Omega bride but the bride comes twice the church comes one time what are you telling us this for there's our preview remember the first preview of The Bride was the early church age amen that was these virtues this listen folks this is not new second Peter wrote it 2 000 years ago he just took a profit to put it together so that we can live it they lived those in the first church days they didn't need a quote book or a statue of perfect man message they listened to Peter they look at James they looked at John they looked at Peter they looked at their lives they said oh they've got brotherly kindness they've got godliness they got patience and then one day Peter says now with inspiration he says add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge Temperance patience well they didn't listen to that foreign the bride became a church to a degree Through the Ages through the Dark Ages but again here comes the second bride the Bride Comes in twice see right here not knowing it but look at my message this morning he's talking about the bride the seed fell on the ground and I see her that was the original seed and she come through the process of these denominations which look only comes into existence once remember brother Brown said you ever denominate you die you denominate you die so you're dead and they're dead they're not coming back listen all that's going on in Ashbury and all the different places praise God because listen if somebody gets healed if somebody gets saved if somebody tries to live a better life praise God if it'll fill the church up praise God but they don't have the full word of God they do not have the completeness of the second bride that we're talking about here this is the completeness of the second brother that's the reason she was reviewed the second time see when brother Branham came on Earth when the message came let's just put it that way when the message came and brother Brown started revealing the the mysteries of God 1963 the seals and different ones that's your perfect man she's not there with a shock um serpent seed uh and all the restoration of Brier tree all these different ones what was he doing he was clearing away all of that junk that was in the in the Middle Ages the church because remember he didn't call his church anymore he called his bride and his brother Tim was saying this this uh yesterday or Saturday Sunday that girl that was the armor meat packing girl those other three Got a Blessing they loved them God they loved it they wanted them they wanted they were happy they wanted to get ready but there was only one got a message one got a promise I'm coming back for you I'm not coming back for them three I'm coming I'm not coming back for a Trinity I'm coming back for one and you know what he did that's what I'm going to say today he did everything he said he'd do he did and he will do and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor remembered the plan the plan Master he was making a masterpiece listen you can't be a masterpiece and be false you can't be a god Masterpiece and be false amen the only thing with the with the analogy of the Michelangelo was that the flaw made it the made it the Masterpiece well that flaw was I flesh but once you get rid of that we are the total Masterpiece of God there's not a piece missing anywhere he's made him a masterpiece for us a piece of his own or his first masterpiece restoration of the Bright Tree we'll talk about four Messengers we'll get to that real quick because we know if we've been here long enough we've got enough knowledge we know that there was four deaf Messengers that killed this tree and four life Messengers that brought it back what was the first Martin Luther justification sanctification this is now this is coming up to that second preview of The Bride now about with me this is coming up to that second preview of the bride all right what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word the word all right there were four great prophets one of them Martin Luther began to shine light it was a little light very small strength of justification but listen they were bright but they had a little piece missing out a couple of pieces couple of doctrines of water baptism a couple of doctrines of probably well they did believe in eternal hell they they took a lot Luther took a lot of those Catholic doctrines you know that he came out of that though and God shined a light on Luther then Wesley said no it needs to be stronger than that uh brother Luther we can't sit in the pub anymore and drink beer and talk about God we got to come out of that all right we got to come to sanctification clean and set aside for service then after Wesley comes stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of holy ghost in other words what in another great prophet the gifts came into the church the Holy Ghost fell on 1906 Azusa Street and there was a Revival a Revival of the gifts that was bringing the gifts back into the church but in the last day of Malachi for Elijah's to come with the very word of God because remember back down here where we just talked about Pentecostals they were trinitarians they still had a piece missing they believed in a trinity they believed then father son Holy Ghost baptism peace is missing listen we got to get the pieces back together we got to get to brother Ram called them the loose ends in other words there was a strand of doctrine that was in God's mind that was totally pure and man comes and starts cutting pieces out of it well here comes the prophet of God and he starts putting the pieces back together here comes Elijah going to build his what to build the altar back together to tell us how to get to God not just tell us how to get a new birth that's been preached since Martin Luther I believe Martin Luther preached to just shall live by faith but he preaches hey you got to be born again you've got to be changed you got to come out of that Catholic system Wesley said you got to be born again plus you gotta live it you can't go in a pub can't do what you used to do then the baptism of my Holy Ghost listen it cleaned a lot of people up it gave them the Holy Ghost and it just not just give it to their soul and anointed their flesh will they speak in tongues Great Mighty Miracles was going on during that time all right so that was and then see then brother Bradham had a platform to step out on god with the gift of God that he had that he would have never lasted in Wesley or Luther's age they couldn't have took it but coming out of the Pentecostal realm coming they what they came with him well some did some stayed there but but he said the Pentecost was the only ones that would what that would claim him in other words in other words it would let him preach him preaching many Wesleyan churches he didn't preach in any many Methodist churches because they didn't want him anymore because of his Doctrine but in the last days the evening lightness to come forth to restore and bring back and turn the hearts of the children we've been preaching that a long time ago four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it or The Messengers The Devil destroyed it and in four matches of righteousness restored her back again prophesy son of man can these bones live look the life only come remember there was all the stages of putting this together and putting that together and they were there but they weren't moving they had no life in them you and I listen let's don't let Satan suck the life out of us he's sucking the life out of some of us he can't do that anymore we rebuke him in the name of the Lord Jesus take that to the profession of the father That We're Not Gonna cower down to that anymore but the life only come not when the senior skin was on it but when the wind blowed on it that's when come back that fourth message of life I will restore saith the Lord praise God the fourth light is to come who is he talking about his message the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh proves of the proof of the Resurrection signed that Christ has finally look finally after justification has been planted sanctification been planted baptism the Holy Ghost organizations died out you know what not one organization quit well brother Brown was alive and not one organization has quit since they have absolutely multiplied so that means only a certain group of people is going to ever hear of the true message of the hour all right organizations died out in crisis against censored himself like the cap of the pyramid look at the top first line justification sanctification baptism the whole ghost incoming of the cap what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed said holy ghost up at the top that's not the baptism the Holy Ghost to make you born again that's the baptism of my Holy Ghost to put you into a Powerhouse of God it'll fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away now listen the same kind of ministry that when Jesus left 2000 years ago that Ministry has never hit the earth like it was then until now it has that's why it's called the son of man in the end time it was God made manifest in a form called Jesus now it's God made manifest in a form called a bride that we have his mind we have his as brother Rob says his potential we don't listen we don't have the potential to preach the truth we have the truth listen God was is not wisdom he's not getting wisdom God's not getting anything me and you're the ones are supposed to be getting it when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in a Rapture justify Sanctified baptism in the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again I believe today it's standing today if you'll realize where you are and why you're here and why you're listening to the word of God like you are or not right you get both the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again this kind of struck me a few minutes ago read it long time ago and I read it again there was a man in Ezekiel they had a line in his hand and he went Eastward Direction means a lot who's coming from the Eastern Gate who's coming from the East right he measured a thousand cubics and he brought me through the waters in other words he stepped a little bit further out brother George it was to his ankles he could walk he could still have issues going on in the upper parts of his body but he didn't stop he brought me through the water and the waters were to the knees a little bit more again he measured a thousand and brought me through in the water to the loins oh it's getting swam now you couldn't swim in that ankle deep water you couldn't swim in the need to eat water kind of hard for brother Donnie to swim in water up to the loins he needs one about 10 foot deep for him to get in and get wet but the water to the loins and look afterwards he measured a thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over now remember let's connect this to the dream that sister Shepard had what was the dream about it was about water it was about her asking God if she was born again and God showed him a Great Pyramid and brother Brown was on top he cut the top out of it he had a he had a box setting up there remember he poured honey and it could wouldn't keep water but once he got it to keep water what was it the water came out and went down and went through sister Shepard into her feet so that's why me and you with this statue of perfect man listen it's a river it says I could not pass over for the waters were risen Waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over and watch what he said Son of Man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return back to the river justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost to the loins he said hang on to me we got something else to do so he said go back now we don't go backwards in God but what's he trying to bring he's bringing the word he's bringing the word of God so watch I just kind of caught this the other day and I want to kind of share it with you then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river so he caused him to come back to where he started how many times have we said justifications education baptismal Holy Ghost and you got to come back and go through justification baptism Holy Ghost then you got to come back and go through justification the higher form of justification higher form of sanctification that's the higher form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what he's telling us right here in this in this Vision now I returned it to Bank of the river there were many trees there was life on that River that was life in the word of God then he said unto me these Waters issue out toward the East Country and go down into the desert how many of you been in the desert before but it's coming through your desert and going to the Sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed and it shall come to pass that everything that liveth remember watch the fourth stage life breathe that everything that liveth which moveth whether so ever the river shall come shall live get in the word of God and you will live then it talks about great multitude of fish because these Waters shall come through the what huge for they shall be healed in everything shall live whether cometh everywhere that River's at there's a River of Life flowing out what from me make the lame to walk and the blind to see wow listen to this trying to get you to a point this is what the statue of perfect meant it's not just that you're not it's the plan of God and we cannot go around it we got to go into it the reason they call Jesus Bells above a devil because you see he could discern the thoughts of their mind see but he was the word of God and Hebrews 4 said the word of God is sharper than to edge sword even Discerning of the thoughts we're going to get to knowledge Maybe see he was the word The Living Word now watch he was the Living Word comes into who us and does the same thing has the same effect on us when are we going to realize that the Lord Jesus never took a negative confession to the father it does the same effect on Earth see same because it's the same word it's the same thing among us and that's the way sometimes those who are not in that bracket speak with tongues and another one interprets what is it the word made flesh again among us Christianity versus Idols in 1961 we are made for takers of his Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God then dead to self raised with him now listen his word made flesh again in US oh brother Neville look what is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God the word in you making itself real glory to God oh I know you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am but brother do you see it triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living God made manifest in a living Temple and everybody's going yes we know that's you brother Bynum yes we know that's you brother around yes oh yeah the Great Mighty signs and wonders and miracles yes brother Branham and we can't do it so we're gonna have to wait on you to come back baloney that's not the word of God ain't gonna happen if you wait till brother Ram gets here you lost because when he gets here we're already sealed in we don't need another ceiling we're already sealed down and the word of God with God look the word of God which Heavenly places triumphed over all things in Christ Jesus now that was 1961 what about 2023 we've got to have more fervor we've got to have more you say oh fight for no peace with God like we're going to talk in a minute maybe patience with God that's what brother Brown said first thing I do have patience with God now that patience with you brother have patience with God I like what brother Brown said he said you know they come up to Noah and they locked him in there for seven days God didn't see go get an arcs he's going to rain number day number six he's like come on Noah daddy you uh he ain't looking good ain't a cloud in the sky you said it's gonna rain he said God said so and that's what's going to happen and guess what it did it happened tell me my brother my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be made manifest outside of this time now right now when were there ever a time in history that manifests the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation you heard about that other earthquake earthquake in turkey again another one right one right after the other it's because the world's waiting on me and you the world is feeling the pull and it's pulling this thing apart but with me and you though it's pushing us back together because we're pressurized for this time we're either we are or we're not why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out all the Old Testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation wow that's a mouthful brother George take a Moses Noah Ena Isaiah David all these great men that we Revere in the Old Testament they couldn't manifest the sons of God like we do no that's what he says it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into what these men not in these buttons if I get up press play until until their Ministry will be so close like Christ who will join him and his church together there's a Ministry being preached now that's bringing us together and then this thought just come Roll to Me I had that quote the other day but this one come right behind it I was thinking about it yesterday watch this we we love to preach about the seals we know what the seals are we have knowledge of what they are but do you know when they're going to break well we know when the sixth Hill is going to break six seal is going to break in its natural form when the two prophets are over in Israel and they're going to call down fire earthquakes whatever they can do but remember there's a six seal sanctification that's got to come to me and you before our body has changed and it will change our body that six Seal A disruption of nature what do you think this is you got some virtue but it ain't Godly I'm just saying you've got some knowledge listen we're full of knowledge well if I had my phone I show you pull up any word you want to and there it is Quick Knowledge too not one well I mean I get home and I'll look at the computer and no it's in your phone actually it's in Donnie's watch right there on his arm so we got plenty of knowledge I don't know about temperance but we do have some certain ones of these godliness we listen Luther was a Godly Man Wesley was a Godly Man for his time that's what it was worth just name all the ones that are not brother Branham because we always put him up you know and that's okay because we do but there's all these other great men that were great but they didn't have everything together you and I have everything together because the Sixth Seal is going to open with two prophets over there but when's the six year going to open to me and you it's going to open on this side and the sixth open of The Sixth Seal is a disruption of nature it takes your nature what your what Your what you're comfortable with it's going to take what you're comfortable with and tear it out and throw it away smash it tell you it's wrong right tell you not to hate your neighbor tell you not to hate your brother if you spoke bad on bad of folks that's against your nature being patient is against your nature laodicea is against your nature prophet of God tells us his power over the waters turn them to blood Smite the Earth with plays that was Moses what is it what can bring these things to look what can breathe these things but what the word right the word the word's only thing is going to bring us back to this the words the only thing that's going to cause we were talking we had a real good time that we had some questions and answers on Sunday about different things about earthquakes and stuff and Resurrection um listen when we come to the end of this thing I just believe that according to brother Brandon if they're going to have the six seal open and it's in its natural form then we're going to have a sick still open in the spiritual form and we're going to be able to maybe have a hamburger when we need it they ain't got no money to pay for it at least we already know that happens go go talk to brother um go talk to uh good grief what's the black brother used to go to church here huh brother Harris poor family sitting around the table didn't have nothing to eat say God we need something to eat whatever how many of them were sitting there the pork chops come out of the sky and hitting their plate yeah you said that Kate well you can go argue with brother Harris well the Harris was stuck out on side of the road one day and his car wasn't cranking he realized he didn't have no gas remember the story he said God I got to get back home I can't get stuck out here on the interstate lord said get back in the car and go home he said I got back in the car and drove 40 miles back to the house empty with no gas in the car storms we've seen spoke out of existence all these different things we've seen pieces of it but brother Brown said you wait till it starts firing you wait till some sister gets all anointed by the Holy Ghost come on somebody and then she starts looking at her kids and saying hey that's what I want that's the one I want Lord I want that girl in the church I want that girl saved I want my husband feel with the Holy Ghost you say you're talking crazy thank you they're the ones who brings on this six sea of what two anointed prophets Anointed with the Holy Ghost not manifested sons of God we are the ones that are the manifested sons of God where God speaks to us but he will speak in three and a half years through these two prophets look they uncover and open it up it's the power of God to interrupt nature this is the power of God today tonight any other time this is the power of God to interrupt your nature and change you in a moment it's going to Columbus we cannot get changed like we are now it's the power of God to interrupt nature see The Sixth Seal is completely an interruption of your nature it's a complete Interruption of the nature of the ball of Earth you're standing on but it's also the ball of Earth you living in and the only way you can do it is to go up the statue of perfect man that's why this is so ill-taught we've got to have these we can't just say we're God listen that ain't part of the plan if it was part of the plan like that Peter would wait had wasted his time right in second Peter add to your Facebook add and after this at did you get it there's your seal who does it it's the prophets on the other side of the Rapture he's talking about when we're gone with the power of God unless they've got the power of God the word of God they just condemn nature I say tonight condemn that nature you live with condemn that thing you can't get over condemn that thing that you're walking around with that you need to get rid of condemn it give it to Jesus Christ and let it take it say I'm done with it they didn't take you to the father he's not going to take it to the father any other way they can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood the sun can go down or anything it's their command amen there you are there you are see how the sealed open down there in the church ages how it showed the martyrs now here's these two prophets standing here with the word of God to do anything to Nature they want to listen it's the same Holy Ghost that's in their mouth it's the same Holy Ghost that's in your soul right now if you're born again what's the difference they've got one group to preach to they got to get 144 000 saved listen you and I got to get saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and Anointed with them that's your perfect man Anointed with the same well you want whatever you want to say manifestations of God or or you can say character of God because what is character it's your nature so it's disrupting our nature see what is the Sixth Seal it's those two Prophets but you're not going to have to have knowledge to understand this Holy Ghost knowledge listen do you say it at night and wonder whether this is right or not I mean do you do you wonder where the gods around you or with you or talking to you yeah sometimes because I ain't spoke to me in the past month well it's your fault not his you doing something wrong not him you can't blame God so the word knowledge let's go through it real quick it's such as belongs to the more advanced and we'll get it because remember knowledge of wisdom is pretty much the same thing because brother Brown tells us the spirit of wisdom is going to come back into the church in the end time that's the spirit that's coming Spirit of wisdom all right especially if things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as insane and right living now looks way back here in the early church age we were talking about this the other day we know one thing's for sure that everything's so intertwined together the false Vine got intertwined around the True Vine listen this is where the separation begins right there that just came to me the other day there is your separating line that is your untwining of the spirits that are twined together are intertwined brother Brown says around the True Vine we find these Deeds of Nick listen God uh nobody but God can live this right Satan can't live this he can have his worldly knowledge and he have his worldly of this and worldly that and worldly power of worldly virtue you've probably got a lot of temperance too but not Holy Ghost knowledge he does not have and can't get these virtues then thirdly you add knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because it's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge what judge right from wrong sit down and open the word of God if you can't understand something say God you know bro Joe Forney he was a illiterate brother didn't go to school he sat down one day and he said God he got saved he said God uh sister Vanessa have to read to him say God if you want me if you calling me to preach and if you calling me to to read this word of God and become a Christian you got to teach me how to read he said he started looking at those words and he said he said I could hear them bespoke because if you can't read you can't you say that word but when he can see that the scripture is not contradictory if you didn't know that that's just a bunch of words on the page your brain inside of your head can't say but when you can see much less understand what's going on he was just able to read words and then all of a sudden God put those words together God did not some teacher listen all of us got most of us got taught by a teacher a natural teacher but he got taught by God how to how to read amen well who was that somebody the other day was telling that same thing with playing a piano Lord I want to play the piano remember he said to give you the desire of your heart Lord I want to play the piano go over there sit down whoever it was and said it just felt like somebody was moving my fingers for me when he said then I got to where I could play and it just became natural what that wasn't no natural teacher that talked thought about it it was what's a fulfillment of the desire of somebody's heart but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see by what Revelation the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it why in the world we were talking about this this weekend why in the world didn't Jesus just come down here and tell us everything plain and and then here we go he said he spoke in parables and riddles and Mysteries to hide it from the wise improve it to make it where you can't read it like a newspaper that way the devil could read it that way listen the devil can't get Revelation folks you and I are the only people can get revelation it's what God's really just like we were talking about that was a new group or a couple of new people there so we were talking about what happened in the garden that well Moses I mean Moses wrote that what two thousand years after the it happened in the Garden of Eden remember you had two thousand years you had to flood and then Here Comes um no one comes on the other side and then he starts having these kids and Moses pops up well Moses is over here he writes the first five books of the Bible he's over there looking at what happened in Genesis why didn't he just write down there was a beast that was in between man and a monkey and he got um he got incarnate by the devil and the and then he laid down with Eve and they had intercourse and then a child was born why did he say that right from the very wise prudent people you know it was a person there I know someone's going to see that but there was a person there not in the message he they told him about the what happened in the garden you know like a year or two ago and he called him perverted he said y'all just about perverts you better be careful that's what the word of God said the word of God said that's what happened in the Garden of Eden so anyway so why didn't Moses do that Moses wrote it in symbols he saw he said okay God's going to change that into a snake that's going to be a serpent but he's a beast and we're going to write way on over here in the Bible another Prophet is going to talk about being the fruit of your mother and the fruit of the womb and and the fruit coming forth from the midst of the garden and all this all these symbols comes together and tells you the exactly what happened but it's not just written out there so God does hide it like this right here the whole word is rodent Mysteries and only knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get in saying punctuate it with an amen somebody ought to practice that then add that to your face brother I'm saying the 70th week of Daniel he says the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost look bringing the church in and revealing what day we're living in sure we know we're living in the end time sure we know we're living in the last days but where are you at in that last day where are you at not where your pastors at not where the preachers are at where are you at bring the church in to reveal what day we're living in just the same as Gabriel to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand it now look at the word wisdom I like this the wisdom which belongs to men specifically the varied knowledge of things human and divine acquired by acuteness and experience and summed up in maxims and proverbs Britain and Mysteries in the Book of Proverbs if you'll watch that movie chosen Jesus says that kind of goes over your head I like that part we used to Matthew was saying he was reading in the Proverbs he said that's kind of deep you know the science alert the act of interpreting dreams and always giving the sages advice the intelligence evicted events in discovering the meaning of some mysterious number of vision skill in the management of Affairs this is wisdom because listen I just read to you the spirit of wisdom is to come back into the church to do what teacher stay stage right here watch this killing the management of Affairs devout and proper Prudence in intercourse with men not Disciples of Christ in other words how to talk to a sinner that's what they're saying how to talk to a sinner do you know how to talk to a sinner if you're a sinner you don't oh you tell them stuff and you can blind their eyes but look skill and discretion in imparting Christian truth skill and discretion in other words don't try to cram it down their throat have wisdom have patience and some difference the knowledge and practice of the requisites for Godly and upright Living Social requirement and you know what it is you know the requirements for Godly living that's why I'm telling you as we get closer and closer up that statue of perfect man look how narrow it gets some people can't live it that far up just the way it is listen in this day and age everybody gets a trophy sorry that ain't what happened when we was growing up and that ain't happening with God either it's a requirement to go up the statue of perfect Mountain he's not going to lose you but you don't get a trophy in The Headstone you don't get a change of the body if you don't do what God Said well that's the truth that we come down to place to now to where everybody gets a trophy everybody gets a hundred on the test everybody gets destroyed that's not so in the word of God brother Brown said you either told the line and you either told the line or you're out that's why the little things that we preach on that's wide down here to have faith but when you got to live virtue and then live knowledge and then live Temperance added to all these things some people are not going to be able to control their temper you listen to what brother Brown said he said you come up with this way this far and you mess up in other words you fall I'm glad you're quiet because this is not just because you're sitting here listening to this you're going to get them you got work to do you gotta overcome I've got to overcome we've all got to have that overcoming power take it to Jesus now and say Lord I need knowledge I don't know what those people are saying I just now come into the message or I've been gone for a long time and I'm just coming in the middle of this of this ball game and I won't know the plan listen if you take that earnestly and honestly to God just like God taught bro Joe it didn't take him two years to learn how to read either it took him just a very short time to learn how to read because God was sitting there feeling as long as he kept that Bible open God was telling him what those words were for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy now who's your greatest enemy the devil nope do this right here don't you point at me Point yourself look it is that simple though it is that simple there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word what it'll make you live right see in verse 3 of blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book He's reading and kind of in the church ages there in Revelations there to he that overcometh to he that overcometh not that he that just shows up I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priest reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many cannot read the priest had to read for him as long as the word the blessing was there if it didn't matter if it was read or heard Ephesians 1 verse 17 we'll stop here in just a second I'm not going to get far enough but I think we've kind of we'll have the whole weekend to start on uh Temperance and patience have patience please let the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom now he said that brother Brown said the spirit of wisdom I'm going to come back into the church now the Bible's telling us this he's going to give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened wow that's what that means wow that's how that fits together have a wild moment every once in a while listen Revelation should excite you because it's not to the world they can get excited about ball games and they get signed about this and they get excited about that but they can't they will not ever get excited about the word of God unless they're born again ever and guess what this will condemn them under their judgment if they are not a part of the word of God the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of us isn't his inherit what is his inheritance in the Saints to give you the Holy Ghost to be a child of God the word revelation is the act the process of disclosing something previously secret or obscure especially something true a fact disclosed or revealed especially in a dramatic or a surprising way somebody ought to absolutely try that sometime hmm in Christianity it's God's disclosure disclosure of his own nature you are reading the Bible you're reading the nature of God and his purpose for mankind his plan especially through the words of human and sorry about that through the words of preachers human intermediaries something and we in which such a Divine disclosure is contained such as the Bible brother Brown said to the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation of water baptism it's right there it's staring you in the face Hebrews 5 13 magicians get ready to come for everyone that uses milk is unskillful and the word of righteousness I'm sitting there today and y'all kind of read that um kind of something passed over me there at the airport we were waiting to to get on a plane and we didn't get our 600 they put us on the plane anyway but anyway we need to come on home so you can't blame you and you blame me I was a little slow I was I was I was a little slow I'm sorry I'm confessing in front of everybody but when we were when we were up there in in Ohio um the wedding was going on uh one of the uh brother Isaac's daughter had had a brand new baby I don't know how Julius how three months old born in February or something like that maybe no born in December so anyway two or three months so just as health as it can be just as helpless as can be and I just stood back and watched everybody I mean you know three or four if you're around her you know she's she's you know you don't weren't diving off the table you don't want her shoving something in her mouth a candle you know they had their attention on her everywhere she couldn't eat they had to feed her well she was feeding another other ways but you had to do it for her baby and she's just like you know if you if you stood her up you let her go it's like God nobody did that but they had to hand her across the table to me and I took her and I held her up and I held her and I said oh man I didn't have a little baby like this in a long time that's Jesus's when he saves your soul he said I've never held a baby like this before even though he's held billions by the new birth you're special to him Julia was special you know there was a lot of people in that in that venue that that never even acknowledged it Julia was a baby and she was there and that she needed help but her family come on somebody her family was commissioned to look after her and I became part of that family because I wanted the family to to enjoy their self you know what babies you yeah you have to have their attention I mean you they have to have your attention so I took her and I held her and I took her over to the side and a just a warm feeling come over me it was like this God this is what you did for us you took us away from our natural family by the new birth but you held us as yours and you're still holding on to us until the day that we can walk on our own two feet and he he feeds us close us changes our dirty diapers somebody say Amen I know all y'all got dirty diapers or had them but he did all that and it didn't bother them one bit and I walked around with that baby for about an hour and I just thank God and another something happened we'll we'll talk about later time but you hold that baby up there and you hear it breathing Jesus hear me breathe let me be so close to God till you hear just my breath and when I cry I'm right there at your ear where I can cry and get what I need if I'm hungry I'm right here don't put me up somewhere don't put me up on a uh you know don't put me in a closet or go set me over in the corner somewhere nurture Me Lord help me to grow help me to get bigger help me to get stronger in you and watch this for everyone that uses milk is unskilled from the word of righteousness for he's the babe now he'll say he's saying it listen this is not negative this is where you got to begin Julia is a baby you were a baby and you had to use milk but remember I'm not gonna do it because I'll make a mess but if you just took Julia and put her right here with this thing open about this far from it what's the first thing going to happen gonna be a mess but actually as she gets older she's going to say that's my milk I want to drink it that's the way we are with God but everyone that uses milk is unskillful musicians come on but strong meat belongs to them that are a full age we didn't take Julia over there and eat the eat the pork that we had served to us and the and the mac and cheese now one day she's going to be able to eat that but she wasn't able to then she was she was able to take milk but that was her part of her journey in her life the next part of the journey if we when we see him again maybe several months from now she'll be eating off the table literally most of y'all did too eat off the table but strong meat belongs to them that are a full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern Good and Evil discern means to separate so we've come to a time here in in knowledge that we've got to separate let's all stand our feet there's a separation time to make a distinction okay I'm just going to stay a baby Christian and that's just all I'm going to get well that's all you're going to get you know what the Lord takes that confession he stands right here and he looks at the father and he says this is all they want to be but Lord take me as a baby but take me to your throne and say I want to grow up I want to be a better not a better person I want to be a better Christian the true church is the continuation of the book of eyes but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction to God's people and the discrediting of God's word that's a whole deal now they're discrediting the word of God they're discreeting in this message they're discreeting brother Brown they're just discredible everybody they're discreeting Jesus Christ saying he who he says he is and it's Satan write down the time he's casting the Lake of Fire he fights it he can't stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation now true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of your body hello and by God's spirit Discerning will stand the Antichrist Spirit state will be powerless before her why was Satan powerless before Jesus Christ he was that Satan cannot understand how these virtues work if he if he did he'd be your brother he does not understand how that works so as we get closer to the headstone we become more like the headstone he will be a definitely thwarted today as he was when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert what do you use no he stood up and spoke the word and said it is written it is written it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail how many of us want the Gates of Hell to be torn down and thrown away boy I do y'all some of y'all already must have it done the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will
