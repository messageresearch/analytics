[3:27] Acts chapter nine
[3:31] you know
[3:32] um we were over at sister milka's house
[3:36] a couple days ago and she was showing us
[3:37] she I guess she's listening in and uh
[3:40] she was showing us some old pictures
[3:42] from 1993 I
[3:45] think so we got to see everybody way
[3:55] back but you know we've all come a long
[3:57] way Monica before we were leaving the
[3:59] house tonight she she said hold on a
[4:02] second I see a white hair and I said
[4:06] well I said we might we might be a while
[4:09] if you're going to get all the white
[4:10] white hairs
[4:12] but yeah we've we've all traveled a long
[4:15] road and maybe tonight just think about
[4:20] how you first heard the voice of God and
[4:23] how it was when you first
[4:26] heard about the Lord and first heard
[4:29] that call
[4:31] amen thank the Lord for his presence
[4:34] amen now before we go to the reading of
[4:36] the word um brother Joe handed me a
[4:38] prayer request back there that brother
[4:41] Emanuel out there in New Mexico he he
[4:43] put in a prayer request for his mom um
[4:46] Sister Evelyn Salazar that she will be
[4:48] going through the first of six chemo
[4:51] sessions tomorrow
[4:53] morning and he says uh brother Leo um
[4:56] which is her wife her husband put in
[4:59] this request he said God bless us all
[5:01] when these trials
[5:03] come and we know that there's promises
[5:06] written in this word that must come to
[5:08] pass he said I am the Lord that heal
[5:11] Health all thy diseases and somebody has
[5:15] to believe that to make it come to fast
[5:18] somebody's got to be there's it's a it's
[5:21] a there's a deep that calleth to the
[5:23] Deep there's got to be somebody to

[7:32] way tonight Lord God we pray Lord God
[7:35] granted Lord that you will have the
[7:36] preeminence in the service tonight we
[7:38] pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[7:42] Christ now
[7:45] hallelujah oh where would we be without
[7:48] God
[7:50] Amen we can gather ourselves together
[7:53] and uh in in different places but
[7:55] without God it would just be in
[7:58] vain and
[7:59] I I want to read maybe a a strange
[8:02] couple of strange little
[8:05] scriptures um that have just you know as
[8:09] I sit out in the audience and I've been
[8:11] listening to a positive attitude and and
[8:16] faith is the substance and uh the shout
[8:19] the voice and the Trump you something
[8:23] something just begins to spin and and
[8:26] and I don't know how you the Machinery
[8:28] begins to work and and uh there's
[8:31] something that's moving because when you
[8:33] hear the word there's a deep that calls
[8:36] to the deep and it something to respond
[8:38] there's got to be
[8:40] something and I believe that
[8:43] uh what what I'm going to speak on is is
[8:47] kind of what began to wor as I listened
[8:49] to the last few months of of of the
[8:52] message
[8:54] and so let's just let me stop talking
[8:57] and
[8:58] read
[9:00] Acts chapter
[9:01] 9 verse one and Saul yet breathing out
[9:06] threatenings and Slaughter against the
[9:07] Disciples of the Lord went unto the high
[9:09] priest and desired of him letters to
[9:12] Damascus to the synagogues that if he
[9:13] found any of this way whether they were
[9:15] men or women he might bring them bound
[9:18] under under
[9:20] Jerusalem and he didn't know God was
[9:22] about to change his
[9:24] Direction exactly right but you know
[9:27] what God saw something in this man that
[9:30] whatever Direction he was going he was
[9:31] going to go full speed that's the direct
[9:34] he was going full
[9:36] speed and when God called him and turned
[9:39] him around he went a different direction
[9:41] but he kept going full speed and as he
[9:44] journeyed he came near Damascus and
[9:46] suddenly there shined round about him a
[9:47] light from heaven and he fell to the
[9:50] Earth and heard a voice saying unto him
[9:52] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he
[9:55] said who art th Lord and the Lord said I
[9:58] am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is
[10:00] hard for thee to kick against the Pricks
[10:03] and he trembling and astonished said
[10:05] Lord what wil thou have me to do and the
[10:09] Lord said unto him arise and go into the
[10:11] City and it shall be told thee what thou
[10:13] must do and the men which journeyed with
[10:16] him stood speechless hearing a voice but
[10:18] seeing no man right now let's turn over
[10:20] to acts
[10:28] 22
[10:31] and we'll read from verse 6 down to
[10:35] verse 9 and it came to pass that as I
[10:38] made my journey and was come nigh unto
[10:40] Damascus about noon suddenly there Shone
[10:42] from Heaven a great light round about me
[10:45] and I fell unto the ground and heard a
[10:46] voice saying unto me Saul Saul why
[10:49] persecutest thou me and I answered who
[10:51] art thou Lord and he said unto me I am
[10:54] Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest
[10:57] and they that were with me saw indeed
[10:59] the light and were afraid but they heard
[11:02] not the voice of him that spake to me
[11:04] now this is a strange strange little
[11:07] scriptures and I what I uh before we
[11:10] read the last verse and then you can be
[11:12] seated just give me one second I I
[11:14] apologize for keeping you standing so
[11:15] long but I I what I want to ask I want
[11:19] to ask a little question and that is can
[11:22] you hear the voice of God and not hear
[11:25] the voice of God now that's a strange
[11:27] little question that's right now let's
[11:29] turn over to
[11:31] John chter
[11:33] 8 verse
[11:38] 39 I'm sorry verse
[11:42] 47 I'm going to read verse 39 later on
[11:44] after your
[11:45] seated he that is of God heareth God's
[11:48] words ye therefore hear them not because
[11:50] you are not of God and you may be seated
[11:53] the Lord add his Blessing to the
[11:57] word so the question is really I want to
[12:01] speak tonight on the voice of God and
[12:04] the question is can you hear the voice
[12:06] of God and not hear the voice of God and
[12:10] you know as Jesus walked the shores of
[12:12] Galilee everybody thought that they had
[12:14] a handle on him all the Pharisees they
[12:15] thought that they they had a handle on
[12:17] all of the the ins and outs of the Old
[12:19] Testament scripture they had every uh
[12:21] they understood uh so they thought how
[12:24] everything should be placed how
[12:26] everything all the different ins and
[12:28] outs and uh of the scripture of of uh uh
[12:33] how everything was supposed to be put
[12:35] together but then Jesus came on the
[12:38] scene and uh somebody that they they
[12:41] grew up with maybe from Nazareth you
[12:44] know they is this the man you know they
[12:47] the man that we went to school with the
[12:48] man that we went to synagogue we we were
[12:50] little when we were little somebody that
[12:53] they were familiar with and and uh isn't
[12:56] it strange how God uses
[13:00] call instead of HE using the Sun or the
[13:02] moon or the Stars to preach the gospel
[13:04] he uses he pulls but from from from the
[13:07] things that you're familiar with he
[13:09] chooses one of your brethren somebody
[13:11] that you're familiar with and and it it
[13:13] it's always becomes a stumbling block to
[13:15] people when they when they looked at
[13:17] Jesus this this person is not somebody
[13:19] that is nice to look upon or uh
[13:24] he you know it's somebody that we would
[13:26] want to parade in our church and and get
[13:28] new members with so it it just baffled
[13:32] their mind that's right and they thought
[13:34] that they understood the scripture and
[13:36] then the the he was the voice of God to
[13:39] them because he was God in flesh God in
[13:43] flesh walked the shores of Galilee and
[13:45] and prove that he was God because the
[13:48] things that he said the things that he
[13:50] did came to pass by his uh by the word
[13:53] of his mouth he showed that he was the
[13:55] same God that the scriptures talked
[13:57] about but yes yet they could not they
[14:00] did not hear the words that he spake
[14:02] they couldn't believe that this man had
[14:07] the word for their day they couldn't
[14:09] believe that this man was the one that
[14:12] would lead them to
[14:13] Salvation
[14:15] and that's always how all all down
[14:19] through the the scripture all down
[14:21] through our lives the devil will send
[14:24] voices of confusion to confuse and
[14:26] distract away from the voice of God
[14:29] to to to take us away from the real true
[14:32] voice of the age the real true thing
[14:35] that will take us to freedom to
[14:37] deliverance and you know brother brandom
[14:40] talked
[14:42] about how that uh I was listening this
[14:45] afternoon to as I worked to the the
[14:48] voice of God in this last age one of the
[14:50] ones that he in that he preached I think
[14:53] it was 1961 the one that I was listening
[14:56] to and he talks about how that God how
[14:59] the the devil will will send
[15:01] distractions of of of different like a a
[15:03] political voice that you want
[15:07] to uh get away from you know even in my
[15:12] work I can see how politics people will
[15:14] try to see how many people they can get
[15:16] under them and see how many people they
[15:18] can uh collect to them and and uh move
[15:21] and there's all these politics and
[15:23] things trying to weave and distract from
[15:26] the real issue at hand this is just even
[15:28] in in the work world that you have a
[15:30] problem but they instead of trying to
[15:32] solve the problem they want to to to
[15:34] collect different people and make their
[15:35] organization larger and that's the same
[15:38] way it works in the in in the religious
[15:40] realm is the devil will try to get
[15:42] people to uh you know a big church a lot
[15:46] of times even I catch myself asking at
[15:49] Fellowship meetings well how many do you
[15:51] have going to your church but that's not
[15:53] the main thing you know the strongest
[15:55] Church in the Bible had what 12 people
[15:59] thank you just 12 little people and one
[16:01] of the strongest church if you can get
[16:04] just if you can get one man to believe
[16:07] brother brandom said then he can you he
[16:10] all it took to defeat all the
[16:11] Philistines a thousand Philistines was
[16:13] one man that went and found old rotten
[16:16] Jawbone of a donkey and picked it up and
[16:17] slew a thousand Philistines because he
[16:20] believed God's word he believed who God
[16:23] said he was and what God would do with
[16:27] his faith right
[16:29] and that's what the devil tries to send
[16:32] distractions to distract us and one of
[16:34] the one of the greatest distractions
[16:36] today is Hollywood how he'll try to
[16:38] he'll come into your home with it get in
[16:40] the home with the television and get in
[16:42] the home with movies and things and
[16:44] preach a message that's contrary to the
[16:46] word brother Brown talked about how that
[16:48] the little kids know you know there's
[16:49] nothing wrong with just putting on a
[16:50] cowboy hat but they know more about the
[16:54] Cowboys and or today is more about the
[16:56] comic book characters more about and
[16:58] Superman and those those different kind
[17:00] of things and then they know about Jesus
[17:02] Christ and you know I I I mentioned in
[17:06] Sunday school if you go back to Genesis
[17:07] Chapter 18 it it talks about the Lord
[17:10] said he told Abraham I I I reveal these
[17:13] things to you I've called you because I
[17:16] knew that you would teach your children
[17:18] and it's so important for us to teach
[17:20] our children to carry on to keep to keep
[17:23] that spiritual multiplication going
[17:25] because you know they're a captive
[17:27] audience you got the Bible says train up
[17:30] a child in the way that it should go and
[17:31] when it's old if you point that eror
[17:33] it's important to train it up when you
[17:35] when you pull the air back not when you
[17:36] let it go I mean it's by by the time you
[17:38] let it go it's too late you got to point
[17:41] it in the right direction when you when
[17:42] you pull that ER back and then when you
[17:44] let it go it's going to continue on in
[17:46] the right direction while they're a
[17:48] captive audience you can sit them down
[17:49] and have a little devotional every night
[17:51] and teach them to teach them the ways of
[17:53] the Lord just like Abraham taught Isaac
[17:56] and Isaac taught Jacob and and and so on
[17:59] Down the Line because you know I I
[18:01] mentioned before God has a trickle down
[18:03] economy it works that way it trickles
[18:05] down all the way all the way from Heaven
[18:08] down down
[18:10] down and now so Hollywood is a is a
[18:14] voice to distract us to distract us from
[18:18] the voice of
[18:19] God and what about the church
[18:22] voice you know
[18:25] numbers prospering empty promises
[18:32] yeah you know in the church world today
[18:35] there's so many empty promises of
[18:36] prosperity and things that we've got
[18:39] this this word faith movement that that
[18:41] pre teaches that if you'll say it
[18:43] without there being anything there
[18:44] that's my interpretation of it you how
[18:47] can you speak it if there's nothing
[18:49] there amen but you got to have something
[18:51] there first you have you have uh women
[18:53] that aren't even uh living according to
[18:56] the Bible with their bobbed off hair and
[18:57] they uh the dress that's not conforming
[18:59] to God's word and they're saying if
[19:01] you'll speak a big fancy house or speak
[19:05] your problems away then you can walk
[19:06] into it but I I believe that first you
[19:09] if you've got the voice of God speaking
[19:11] to you inside of your heart that speaks
[19:13] out his word to you then let you then
[19:16] you can you have something to say you
[19:18] can speak it but first you've got to get
[19:20] it to speak it first you got to receive
[19:22] the shout let that the the voice of the
[19:24] Archangel live in you and speak inside
[19:26] of you that that which is Christ
[19:28] live inside of you and speak out his
[19:30] word and and that is is what I'm what
[19:33] I'm getting at how can you hear the
[19:36] voice of God how is it possible and you
[19:39] know in this in this day it should be
[19:42] more apparent than ever that it is
[19:45] possible for someone to sit and hear the
[19:47] voice of God be preached and spoken and
[19:51] not hear the voice of
[19:57] God what a strange thing
[20:00] right you know if you talk about hearing
[20:03] the voice of God then you're
[20:05] automatically branded in the same
[20:07] category than some of the people that I
[20:09] see on the
[20:10] train now I I've SE I've seen uh I I I
[20:15] like I've told this story before one
[20:16] time I heard this Street Preacher on the
[20:18] train that was preaching about
[20:21] vegetables and things he was not
[20:23] preaching about the word of God he was
[20:25] preaching like a sermon uh you know
[20:27] because they're they're not in their
[20:29] right mind he was preaching about eating
[20:31] broccoli and different things it wasn't
[20:33] even about religion at
[20:34] all and they when you when you say that
[20:38] go God speaks to you that you hear the
[20:40] voice of God it puts you in the category
[20:43] of a lunatic it puts you in the category
[20:45] of somebody that try going to work
[20:48] sometime and say God told me to do
[20:52] something and they'll automatically lump
[20:54] you into a crazy crazy category but the
[20:58] it isn't that amazing that the gospel is
[21:00] brought through the foolishness of the
[21:02] Gospel through the through the
[21:03] foolishness of preaching it it seems
[21:06] crazy to the Natural mind the natural
[21:08] eye but to to someone that wants to hear
[21:11] from God it's more precious than gold
[21:14] it's more precious than than
[21:18] Jewels we should be so fortunate
[21:23] because think think of all the
[21:25] scriptural types and things about how
[21:27] few there would be Elijah thinking is
[21:29] there is there even even a few that
[21:32] still believe God's word and God pulled
[21:34] them aside and said yes there're still
[21:36] you know I still Reserve 7,000 that
[21:39] still believe that still are standing by
[21:41] and you know it seems like it's getting
[21:43] fewer and fewer but I I want to hold to
[21:46] God's unchanging hand and keep right on
[21:48] because you know God's given us
[21:50] something that if if you hear the voice
[21:52] of God which is so rare today if you
[21:55] hear it there's nothing in the world can
[21:57] take it away
[21:59] there's nothing in the world can take
[22:00] that from
[22:01] you now it's always
[22:07] rejected when they heard Jesus who was
[22:10] God himself veiled in flesh Veil behind
[22:12] his Badger skins they they rejected it
[22:15] so what about what about a little old us
[22:17] you know that will come and and and try
[22:19] to try to preach a little bit of the of
[22:22] the Gospel one of one of the things I
[22:23] think is so amazing is is Psalm 82 4-6
[22:26] I'm jumping around here a little bit I
[22:28] know y'all just bear with me
[22:31] but that's the scripture that talks
[22:33] about how that Jesus quoted you you know
[22:37] you have a problem when I say I'm the
[22:39] Son of God but the scripture says that
[22:42] ye are gods to the ones that the word
[22:44] came to are gods and that's in Psalm 82
[22:47] 4-6 and it's so amazing how it starts
[22:50] off in verse four deliver the poor and
[22:52] needy rid them out of the hand of the
[22:56] wicked the poor or needy are the ones
[22:59] that need to hear the voice of
[23:01] God they know not neither will they
[23:04] understand they walk on in darkness all
[23:05] the foundations of the Earth are out of
[23:07] course I have said ye are gods and all
[23:10] of you are children of the most
[23:14] high and you know when God sends a voice
[23:16] he sends a sign to to declare he sends a
[23:21] pillar of fire to declare that The Voice
[23:23] is coming he sends us he does something
[23:25] to declare that that something's coming
[23:29] he to catch the eye of the people he
[23:31] sends a sign and and that shows that
[23:33] something is taking place a sign in the
[23:36] heavens a cloud a sign over the
[23:39] Tabernacle a sign uh a sign in your
[23:42] personal life a sign to show that God is
[23:46] moving on the scene and you know he
[23:49] showed all of these sign I I just wrote
[23:51] down a lot of the signs that were in
[23:53] brother brandom's life the messenger of
[23:56] this age to show that God was about to
[23:59] speak in April 6th 1909 when brother
[24:02] Brown was born his little 15-year-old
[24:05] mother had a baby 15 years old and the
[24:08] pillar of fire came in in the window and
[24:10] identified you know it scared people and
[24:13] something strange is
[24:15] happening when he was just 6 months old
[24:18] something touched the heart of his
[24:19] neighbor to come and say the little the
[24:22] little baby and his mother from freezing
[24:24] in the cold when he was 7 years old he
[24:27] heard the voice from the popper tree
[24:28] Never Smoke Drink or defile your body in
[24:30] any way when he was 3 years old he had
[24:33] his first Vision that he would live near
[24:35] New Albany when he was nine his vision
[24:39] he had that vision of the bridge where
[24:40] six men died and you know that's some
[24:43] that's one of those things that's
[24:45] contentious today how many died how many
[24:47] you know we think men can think that
[24:50] we've got our you can't reason out the
[24:53] word now look over in uh where where I
[24:56] was just reading from those two stories
[24:58] of Acts it looks like different things
[25:00] are taking place and how would you
[25:04] understand that we know that all
[25:05] scripture was given by inspiration by
[25:07] the by the by the pen of a ready writer
[25:11] the by inspiration of the Holy Ghost and
[25:14] everything is just perfectly in line
[25:16] it's all true and you can't there's so
[25:19] many scriptures that you can't reason
[25:22] out with your own with your own you
[25:23] can't if you can't study enough you
[25:26] can't uh try have figured out enough but
[25:29] the only way that you'll really know
[25:32] what without a shadow of a doubt what is
[25:34] written in God's word is if God comes
[25:36] and the voice of God speaks within your
[25:38] heart and reveals it to you and and I
[25:41] one of my favorite quotes is what
[25:43] brother Wade says about how if Paul said
[25:46] you'll be judged by my gospel and if you
[25:49] believe if you have the same voice of
[25:51] God inside of you that's speaking out
[25:53] that same gospel that Paul preached and
[25:55] it is the same gospel and it do tell
[25:57] just perfectly then you'll be
[26:00] God that you'll be judged by my gospel
[26:03] if it's the same thing if it lines up
[26:05] that's what that brother Bram when when
[26:07] he went beyond the curtain of of time he
[26:10] all the saints there said we're resting
[26:12] on your gospel being the same as his
[26:15] gospel it's the same
[26:18] thing and uh we're resting on it because
[26:23] it's not the voice of a man but it's the
[26:26] voice of God
[26:28] and you'll never understand the voice of
[26:30] this message the voice of the prophet of
[26:33] the uh the what's in the books and the
[26:36] tapes without God himself coming and
[26:39] revealing it to you and speaking it from
[26:41] your heart right and you know when God
[26:44] comes and speaks it to your heart then
[26:46] you could you have something that you
[26:47] can rest on you have something that uh
[26:51] will bring what's written in God's word
[26:53] to
[26:54] pass and when he was a teenager that
[26:56] astrologer said young man did you know
[26:59] there was a sign falling
[27:01] you and one day as he nailed in a
[27:03] Woodshed to pray a light came in and
[27:05] formed the cross and something swept
[27:07] over him as he said something swept over
[27:09] me that I had never felt
[27:11] before
[27:15] and you know then keeping moving on down
[27:18] the the pillar of fire on the uh when he
[27:20] was I think 22 years old baptized in the
[27:23] 17th person at the end of spr Spring
[27:26] Street the pillar of fire came down and
[27:28] identified with that Messenger as John
[27:31] the Baptist was sent to forerun the
[27:32] first coming of Christ you'll have a
[27:34] message that'll forerun the second
[27:35] coming of Christ and then that Pillar of
[27:37] Fire came and appeared in 1950 in the
[27:40] Sam Houston Coliseum and I was uh just
[27:42] messaging back and forth with some
[27:44] Believers and I think that was the
[27:45] Philippines and they you know they were
[27:47] talking about how they had never uh had
[27:49] a privilege to come to the America
[27:51] before and they heard so many people say
[27:53] that that photograph was faked and this
[27:55] these different kind of things and you
[27:56] know all the different things about how
[27:58] that there's not really a a a hall of
[28:01] religious art in the Library of Congress
[28:03] like brother Brenham said things like
[28:05] that but I told him well I was there
[28:08] because when I was 10 years old my
[28:09] parents took me there and we walked into
[28:12] the Hall of religious art and I it might
[28:14] not have exactly that name but that's
[28:16] where they put all the religious art and
[28:18] it was there and the lady at the front
[28:20] desk had it at the desk because it was
[28:22] so often resp requested and they would
[28:25] come in and people would walk off with
[28:27] it because they wanted that Pillar of
[28:29] Fire and they had to keep ordering
[28:31] another copy of it and you know the the
[28:35] word of God is true it's a true
[28:37] testimony a true Vindication it it is
[28:40] true and not just because of these
[28:42] testimonies but uh well let me I'm
[28:45] trying not to get thee of
[28:49] myself actually that's where I'm leading
[28:51] up
[28:51] to you know then God sent sent sign
[28:56] different two signs in brother R's life
[28:57] the sign in the hand and the sign in the
[29:00] the to discern the spiritual gifts to
[29:02] attract the attention of the people but
[29:04] you know how we really know that the
[29:07] message is true it's the same way the
[29:09] same way that all the prophets were
[29:11] identified all down through scripture is
[29:13] by the voice that they had the voice
[29:16] that that rang out that trumpeted out
[29:19] that bore record that all the it
[29:21] identified them with the Scriptures it
[29:23] showed that they lined up exactly
[29:25] perfectly with the scriptures and it
[29:27] showed that the word that they spoke was
[29:29] true when they said uh uh when when when
[29:33] the when the prophet made a made a
[29:35] statement made a declaration that this
[29:37] is thus sayith the Lord and then it came
[29:39] to pass then that showed that there was
[29:42] something at
[29:43] work an undeniable
[29:46] evidence and that is
[29:49] uh I'm leading up to something here I'm
[29:51] moving a little bit slow y'all hang
[29:53] on you know all through scripture
[29:57] you had to compare the voice with the
[30:00] word to see whether it was true or not
[30:03] you had to take it in the Old Testament
[30:04] they had the urum and thumm which was
[30:07] you know that's no who would even know
[30:09] what the urum thumm was unless a prophet
[30:12] came Scholars and and what more they
[30:15] they probe and and poke at that issue
[30:18] what what is the urum thumb was it this
[30:20] or was it that and then a prophet came
[30:22] on the scene and told us that it was the
[30:24] breastplate and when that when the
[30:26] spirit Came Upon that breastplate to
[30:28] identify what the speaker had said what
[30:30] their testimony was it would flash or
[30:32] not flash or or show an identified that
[30:36] what they said was true and now today's
[30:39] urum thumb the urum thumb today that we
[30:41] have today is God's word that we can go
[30:43] and open it up and and and see what how
[30:47] it reflects back our life and identify
[30:50] as whether our lives are correct or
[30:53] not it shows what's wrong with our lives
[30:56] you know know you can take the you got
[30:58] to take the message and the Bible and
[31:00] line it up together and it just exposes
[31:03] every one of one of my favorite things
[31:06] is to get on the on the train in the
[31:07] morning that's my little meditation time
[31:10] and I open up the Bible or the message
[31:12] and it begins to reveal things whoops I
[31:14] have was wrong there I had a little
[31:17] something it's a little problem right
[31:19] there and it begins to it begins to
[31:21] meddle in my life it begins to uh Roo
[31:24] around and and find little things that
[31:26] needs bit straightening out and that's
[31:28] how God will straighten us out by his
[31:30] word he'll chip away and chip away until
[31:33] we begin to be reflected in His image so
[31:35] that he can you know that's what we're
[31:37] all going for we're all progressing for
[31:40] until he can look down on the earth and
[31:42] see himself reflected back and then
[31:45] he'll come down and catch his catch his
[31:47] waiting bride away because he sees us
[31:49] living and walking and talking in the
[31:52] word not denying one word not not like
[31:56] Eve did that just took one word off but
[31:59] a a bride that's staying absolutely
[32:01] spotless believing every jot every
[32:05] tit oh God help us to be like that well
[32:08] we'll stay perfectly perfectly in line
[32:10] with God's
[32:12] word and I I wrote a little quote down
[32:15] here I don't think I gave this to them
[32:18] in the pergan church age now I want you
[32:20] to be very careful here and see this God
[32:23] has promised that at the end time
[32:24] Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled right
[32:27] it has to be for it is the spirit
[32:29] quickened word of God spoken by the
[32:31] prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it
[32:34] is just before Christ comes the second
[32:36] time by the time Jesus comes all
[32:39] scripture must be fulfilled and here we
[32:42] are fulfilling the scripture that's what
[32:44] I believe we're fulfilling the scripture
[32:46] that was spoken by the prophet of
[32:48] Malachi 4 you got to
[32:51] have it couldn't have been just Jes uh
[32:54] let me let me State this right when
[32:57] when the uh the woman with the issue
[33:00] came to be healed there's got to be
[33:03] there's got to be two in the in the uh
[33:05] there had to be one to give and one to
[33:07] receive it's got to be like a deep a
[33:09] deep that calls to the Deep there's got
[33:11] to be a a a a radio radio tower and a
[33:15] receiver a tower and an antenna that
[33:18] picks up the signal and it
[33:21] it's you know that's what's happening
[33:24] tonight is the the voice of God where
[33:27] whether you're sitting and listening at
[33:28] a table or with to the tape or sitting
[33:30] in church listening to somebody preach
[33:33] there's a there's a back and forth a
[33:35] deep calling to the Deep there's a voice
[33:37] that what just gets me so much is when
[33:40] you could when you're sitting in church
[33:42] and go God begins to uh put together
[33:44] scriptures that you never even thought
[33:46] went together and begins to speak to
[33:49] your heart and show you things bring
[33:51] things to your remembrance and show you
[33:53] things to come and show you
[33:55] things
[33:57] come
[34:00] on y'all excuse me I'm going to get
[34:02] carried away
[34:05] here he begins to put things together
[34:07] that you didn't even know went together
[34:09] because there's a voice that's speaking
[34:11] to you a voice behind the pull pit a
[34:12] voice in the tape a voice that's calling
[34:14] out to you a voice that's calling and
[34:16] there's a deep that's responding a deep
[34:18] that's that's answering back a deep that
[34:20] within your
[34:24] heart Thank You Lord hallelujah
[34:27] let me calm down a second that's so I
[34:29] can
[34:32] continue and God gave a pillar of fire
[34:36] as a sign that his voice was about to
[34:38] speak and the urum Thum Vindicator that
[34:41] it was the
[34:44] truth in the voice of God in this last
[34:46] days brother Brown talked about how
[34:50] that there was a woman that that said
[34:52] she called up and said I am a uh I a
[34:55] prophetess and and she said uh I heard
[34:57] that you have Vindicated my Ministry and
[35:00] he said I I don't even I don't even know
[35:02] what you're talking about how can I do
[35:03] that when you're you're not you living
[35:05] according to the Bible you're not you're
[35:08] women are not supposed to uh preach and
[35:11] and all these other things and and uh
[35:13] she said well you I'll tell you what the
[35:16] Lord told me to go to the uh I think it
[35:21] was Phoenix Arizona and dig up the lost
[35:22] Dutchman gold mine and he said right
[35:25] there on the tape we all know
[35:27] and I don't believe we all did but he
[35:29] said we all know that the lost Dutchman
[35:30] gold mine is just a a legend and that
[35:34] ought have stopped everybody right then
[35:36] from going to look for the lost Dutchman
[35:38] gold mine but he said now if you want to
[35:40] see if God told you that then go there
[35:43] on that certain certain date and start
[35:45] digging and if you come up with the lost
[35:47] Dutchman gold mine then you know that
[35:49] God told you that now that's how you
[35:51] know that God told you something if go
[35:54] if you continue on and and and what you
[35:57] believe that God has revealed to you
[35:59] doesn't come to pass you I think about
[36:02] so many people who have said well God
[36:04] told me to marry such and such a person
[36:06] and you know when they're standing on
[36:07] your doorstep and and you say God's told
[36:10] me to marry this person and they're not
[36:12] living right they're not doing right
[36:13] they're not conforming to God's word and
[36:15] something's off there let's continue on
[36:17] and maybe down the road they'll come to
[36:20] the Lord and start living right and
[36:21] doing right but you got to compare it
[36:24] with God's word you got to compare with
[36:25] a urum thumb to see to make sure that
[36:28] you're going in the right direction
[36:30] because without God's word without the
[36:33] voice of God to guide us to direct our
[36:35] lives where would we be we'd be like
[36:37] lost ships on the on the sea we'd be uh
[36:40] going to and fro we wouldn't know which
[36:42] dire we wouldn't know what's where North
[36:44] was on the compass without the message
[36:47] of the hour we would be so lost without
[36:49] God's Prophet to show us where we would
[36:52] where to go to to to call us out of the
[36:54] denominational ideas to call us out out
[36:56] of our own
[36:58] ideas and our own thoughts and to show
[37:00] us
[37:02] that God's grace to
[37:05] us you know when Moses came and and he
[37:08] threw down the stick he knew what was
[37:11] going to happen because God told him it
[37:13] was going to happen and he just waited
[37:16] here comes Pharaoh out and he throws
[37:17] down uh he does his thing and and his
[37:20] little magicians and and Moses didn't
[37:22] get all worried because when the voice
[37:24] of God speaks to you there 's no fear
[37:27] perfect love casteth out fear what are
[37:29] you going to worry about you know I I
[37:31] used to when I was a kid I used to worry
[37:33] about something under the bed and
[37:36] something in the closet but then one day
[37:38] I got uh you know I I used to have a
[37:41] problem with the dark even until I get I
[37:43] got you know my teenagers and whatnot I
[37:46] you know it's spooky rooms at night
[37:48] whatever but then one day I got uh I
[37:52] heard from the voice of God and you know
[37:54] I never had a problem with that no more
[37:55] and I that's that's my personal
[38:00] experience perfect love casts out fear
[38:02] you're not you don't worry about what
[38:04] people say if you know what the truth is
[38:06] it doesn't matter what anybody else says
[38:08] it doesn't matter if anybody disagrees
[38:09] with
[38:11] you because you know where you're
[38:13] standing because you've got that that
[38:15] anchor that holds the voice of God it's
[38:18] not my voice these are not my words it's
[38:22] and that's why it's so something you can
[38:25] you can just anchor soul in because it's
[38:27] not something I came up with it's not
[38:29] something any man came up with but it's
[38:31] something that was written it from the
[38:33] beginning to the end it holds together
[38:35] it's so
[38:36] cohesive it ties together so perfectly
[38:39] when God opens it up to you that
[38:41] everything is beyond explanation how
[38:44] everything from Genesis to Revelation
[38:47] ties together and we know it's true
[38:49] that's how we know that the message is
[38:50] true that's where we know that what the
[38:52] prophet taught was true that's how we
[38:54] know that the scripture is true because
[38:56] you can you can come at it with your own
[38:58] ideas and end up in who knows where but
[39:00] when God comes and sheds the Gospel
[39:02] Light on it then it it it uh it's
[39:06] something that man there there's no
[39:10] right there's no way to explain how
[39:14] perfect how perfect it is now look at
[39:17] how Jonah and Jonah came forth with a
[39:20] sign that he was down in the belly of
[39:21] the well and then he came forth
[39:23] preaching a gospel message of
[39:25] Deliverance first he had the sign and
[39:27] when he came out all those people that
[39:29] had been worshiping a fish God de gone
[39:31] they saw that Jonah come out of the of
[39:33] the sea and walk right out of a fish and
[39:35] they said something's happening you know
[39:38] what they thought they thought that God
[39:40] was about to speak and that's exactly
[39:42] what happened because Jonah was the
[39:44] messenger he was the voice of God to
[39:46] them he was the voice of God to those
[39:48] people in Nineveh and they heard it and
[39:51] believed contrary to his expectations
[39:54] now that's something a messenger going
[39:55] down to preach to people who I don't
[39:58] even think I want to preach to
[40:02] them but yet they believed him yes sir
[40:05] and and Christ Jesus said I I'll give
[40:08] you a sign I'll give you a sign that
[40:09] just like the prophet how the prophet
[40:11] Jonah was down in the belly of the well
[40:14] I'll the son of man will be down in the
[40:15] belly of the Earth for three days and
[40:17] three nights and then he'll rise up and
[40:19] I'll give you a a what voice follow that
[40:22] sign the voice to show that it was the
[40:24] truth what he had said came to pass and
[40:27] then what he had said all all those
[40:29] three and a half years before begin to
[40:31] come to pass because the voice of God
[40:34] was living inside of people that living
[40:37] inside of the people that that stayed
[40:39] true to God's word and went up to the uh
[40:42] to Jerusalem carried and waited until
[40:45] God's word came to pass and his word his
[40:48] word came to pass in their lives and and
[40:50] lived in them let me let me stop here
[40:52] for a second and and let's look at that
[40:54] uh
[40:55] quote
[40:56] number
[41:04] one now this is the quote that that
[41:07] caught a lot of people off guard when he
[41:08] said it and it still catches a lot of
[41:10] people off
[41:11] guard
[41:14] yeah in my
[41:16] commission now I'm just your brother by
[41:19] the grace of
[41:21] God but when the angel of the Lord moves
[41:23] down it becomes then a voice of God to
[41:25] you
[41:26] if I offended you by saying that forgive
[41:28] me but I felt that might have been
[41:31] resented but I am God's voice to you see
[41:35] I say that again that time was under
[41:36] inspiration see and I I felt bad about
[41:39] the first time but it repeated it
[41:42] right you know whenever you make a
[41:44] declaration that God has done something
[41:46] for you it it tends to offend people God
[41:49] has done something for me he's delivered
[41:51] me he's helped me then it makes people
[41:54] nervous and I hope it doesn't make any
[41:56] anybody nervous because there is a bomb
[41:58] in Gilead there is something there there
[42:01] he said come unto me all ye who who are
[42:03] who labor and a heavy laden and I'll
[42:05] give you rest he'll give you a rest that
[42:08] uh if if you hadn't uh if you're still
[42:10] out in the world you don't can't even
[42:12] fathom what kind of rest it is how great
[42:14] the rest of God is not have to uh you
[42:17] know when when the pressures of Life
[42:19] come upon you and begin to Heap upon you
[42:21] you could we have somebody that we can
[42:22] take our troubles to take our our trials
[42:25] and and go before the Lord and say you
[42:27] know such and such thing is bothering me
[42:29] help me you know I I wonder you know how
[42:33] Robin Williams was in the news and how
[42:35] do people live without the Lord how they
[42:38] they cover up with a mask of of that's
[42:41] the American way and the American Spirit
[42:43] to just laugh through troubles and and
[42:46] laugh and make a big Jolly out of
[42:48] everything but
[42:50] um you don't have to hide behind a mask
[42:53] you know one day all things will be
[42:55] unveiled whatever we we are whatever
[42:56] we're hiding the things that are deep
[42:58] down inside it's all going to come out
[43:00] sooner or later so it's better to just
[43:03] unveil it now just let loose and let God
[43:06] let God come and probe your life and see
[43:08] what's inside there and start changing
[43:10] you
[43:25] that's
[43:28] and you know Abel one of my favorite
[43:30] stories in the Bible is this Abel's
[43:33] little Abel sacrificed how Abel came and
[43:36] you know where Abel Abel's trouble began
[43:39] when that voice that Revelation that he
[43:41] had began to speak because you know it
[43:44] says that in Genesis 4:8 that Abel
[43:47] talked with Cain or Cain talked with
[43:49] Abel uh they were talking one with
[43:51] another and you know what happened the
[43:53] Bible doesn't spell it out but Abel told
[43:55] his Revelation right he he he told Cain
[43:59] what the problem was and you know uh
[44:03] Abel's sacrifice was Vindicated by a
[44:06] sign and his sign was followed by a
[44:09] voice he it was followed by that message
[44:12] that little conversation and he gave his
[44:14] life for what his Revelation was and you
[44:17] know when Abel offer he he abble offer
[44:20] that sacrifice he he brought that
[44:22] sacrifice up and it looked like uh I I
[44:25] compare it maybe with with Jesus walking
[44:27] on the shore of Galilee what are you
[44:28] doing Abel is this the man that we're
[44:31] supposed to follow what are you doing is
[44:34] brother brandom the man this little man
[44:37] from out of nowhere is this the man that
[44:39] we're supposed to follow that don't even
[44:40] know his ABCs that doesn't come out what
[44:43] what Seminary did he come from is this
[44:46] is this the word of the Lord able when
[44:49] you're bringing your little sacrifice up
[44:50] dragging up this oh uh why are you
[44:54] starting cutting on this lamb and and he
[44:56] threw that lamb up and brother brandom
[44:58] explained it like this he doesn't want
[45:00] just he wants you as a sacrifice up on
[45:03] that altar he wants you to lay up there
[45:05] and say God whatever it takes to to
[45:08] clean me up to get me walking right and
[45:11] that's all of our problem I I was I I
[45:14] was read there's another story I love
[45:17] about Charles finny how Charles finy was
[45:19] actually preaching and there was these
[45:21] two little sisters that said we're
[45:23] praying they saw something that was
[45:25] laughing in Charles finny's life even
[45:28] though he was up behind the pull pit
[45:29] preaching the word of God but they saw
[45:31] something in his life that was lacking
[45:32] and they said we're praying that you're
[45:34] going to receive the Holy Ghost well
[45:36] Charles finny hadn't been exposed to him
[45:39] what was lacking in his life until one
[45:41] day he was at work and he went behind
[45:42] the work and he prayed every day now
[45:44] think about that now he prayed every day
[45:47] yeah but yet he hadn't heard the voice
[45:49] of God right he was preaching but yet he
[45:51] hadn't heard the voice of God and it
[45:53] went beyond Behind the the the his
[45:56] little uh uh work building and he and he
[45:58] knelt down and he heard a branch crack
[46:02] and that revealed what was lacking in
[46:05] his life amen because he he became
[46:08] embarrassed he realized it what he he
[46:12] quickly jumped up and he looked around
[46:13] and he realized that he was ashamed of
[46:16] the gospel and right then and there he
[46:18] had a conversion experience and he his
[46:21] conversion experience was so real that
[46:23] he had to he thought he said I'm I'm
[46:26] afraid that I'm going to bring reproach
[46:28] on the gospel so he he went and hid
[46:30] behind the door while he shouted and had
[46:33] a Glory Hallelujah time because
[46:35] something real had taken place and that
[46:39] that's what I want to say tonight is
[46:41] that if you've lived a holy life if you
[46:43] think you've got all the ins and outs
[46:45] discovered of the message if you've got
[46:47] everything figured out where you got uh
[46:49] because you know Paul said though you
[46:52] understand all Mysteries though you have
[46:54] all knowledge though you you have all
[46:56] these different things those are just
[46:58] like tinkling symbols cl cl cl cl you go
[47:00] to somebody and say well let me tell you
[47:02] how much I know when really you know the
[47:04] Bible says if you think you know
[47:06] something you don't really know anything
[47:08] at
[47:08] all because the more you know there's
[47:11] actually even in in the the the
[47:13] non-religious realm there's a a word for
[47:15] that it's called um uh impostor syndrome
[47:19] with the more you know like when you get
[47:21] a PhD you think well I you begin to
[47:23] realize how little you know and you
[47:25] begin to feel like you're an impostor
[47:27] that's almost the more you know the more
[47:31] you realize you don't know right and and
[47:37] uh I I I went around in a circle and I
[47:39] forgot where I where I
[47:42] was
[47:44] amen now so now Abel sacrifice
[47:50] he y'all just bear with
[47:54] me Abel's sacrifice it was Vindicated by
[47:58] God and we you know we w we talked about
[48:01] how God Vindicated Abel's sacrifice just
[48:03] the same way he Vindicated all the other
[48:06] little sacrifices down through the Old
[48:07] Testament by showing that it was the
[48:09] truth by coming down and consuming it by
[48:11] fire a a visible evidence that something
[48:14] had taken place but then how do you
[48:17] really know the Revelation is that it
[48:20] compares to the the message has to go
[48:22] out there's so many people that today
[48:24] that um that that you know lay hands on
[48:28] the sick and and they shall recover and
[48:31] and do different thing you know they
[48:32] they pray for the sick and they recover
[48:34] uh arms restore different things
[48:36] happening all these different thing you
[48:38] know
[48:39] uh uh TL Osborne had a he said he went
[48:45] before the Lord and prayed that God
[48:47] would give him the same kind of gift
[48:49] that was in brother bram's life and God
[48:51] did he he because he prayed and asked
[48:54] honestly he gave him a gift of healing
[48:56] in his ministry but yet he didn't have a
[48:59] message that followed that he didn't
[49:00] have there was no voice you and that's
[49:03] how you know that God is really on the
[49:05] scene is there's a voice that proclaims
[49:07] that trumpets out that compares back
[49:09] with the
[49:11] scripture and that's how you know that
[49:14] God has done something in your
[49:16] life and that's what I'm getting
[49:20] at you know brother Brandon preached
[49:22] that sermon doors and door and about how
[49:24] amen uh
[49:26] you we want to have a life lived by the
[49:28] word and the way to do that is for to
[49:30] let God's word probe around inside to
[49:34] give him free access that's one of the
[49:37] things that we we have such a problem
[49:39] doing is is opening up our heart to let
[49:42] God take a look inside and see where
[49:44] we're messed up at see what the problems
[49:47] are about a personal life what your
[49:50] personal life is he said uh he said you
[49:53] go into the door of the heart and right
[49:55] there on the right is that little door
[49:57] to the to your personal life about how
[50:00] you uh don't let nobody talk to me about
[50:04] my dress yeah or my hair and he started
[50:07] running down through all those things
[50:08] don't let God's word meddle with those
[50:11] things but you know that's what the
[50:12] voice of God does the voice of God and
[50:16] that message the voice of God to this
[50:18] age was calling out and if the voice of
[50:21] God and the people would recognize what
[50:23] the voice of God behind the pullit was
[50:25] saying then their life would change
[50:28] that's what brother Brandon was talking
[50:30] about when he said there's a deep
[50:31] calling to the Deep when you lay in bed
[50:33] at night and that deep from Beyond calls
[50:35] to the deep down inside of you there's a
[50:37] deep to respond the deep is the soul of
[50:40] man man and the soul of God you know the
[50:43] soul is not just some that that deep
[50:46] it's not just some wispy thing floating
[50:47] around and you know we've heard that for
[50:49] years it's taught here that it's not
[50:51] just some wispy thing but that deep is a
[50:53] person it's a person of Jesus Jesus
[50:55] Christ calling out to the person that's
[50:58] inside of you the soul that's calling
[51:01] out and there's a where there's a deep
[51:03] there's a deep to respond when when you
[51:05] feel that call then you you had better
[51:08] respond because one day it'll be too
[51:10] late right one day the ark's doors will
[51:14] be shut you know the Bible says that in
[51:17] the day in the in in this day in the day
[51:19] of the coming of the son of man it will
[51:21] be like it was in the in the day of Noah
[51:23] and you know in that day he went all
[51:26] around the world all uh as a type
[51:30] Gathering up little pieces of wood from
[51:33] here and there and he pitched him all
[51:36] together and today little people are
[51:38] being gathered up from all over the
[51:40] world and they're being gathered up
[51:41] together in the great God's great big
[51:43] building his his statue of a perfect man
[51:47] building the pyramid and they're being
[51:49] pitched together by the Holy Ghost into
[51:52] a great building that will not be
[51:53] sinkable it will Sail on and and and and
[51:57] sail forth based on God's word because
[51:59] that Ark was designed by God and this
[52:02] building is designed by God and the only
[52:05] way that you'll know how everything is
[52:07] fit together is by the voice of God in
[52:09] your
[52:13] life the woman at the well the woman
[52:16] with the issue of blood the Deep calling
[52:18] to the deep and in the Old Testament you
[52:21] there was so many things that they could
[52:23] not
[52:24] see they couldn't really get their mind
[52:28] they couldn't really understand about
[52:31] what why was circumcision so important
[52:34] what what was
[52:35] circumcision what was communion what was
[52:39] the the the Resurrection The Rapture who
[52:42] they were what they had what uh even
[52:44] when Jesus told Peter I give you the
[52:47] Keys of the Kingdom uh well you know if
[52:50] I put myself in Peter's place and the
[52:52] Lord told me that okay what next and and
[52:57] you just uh they they didn't know until
[53:01] the voice of God began to echo through
[53:03] their life through the new birth right
[53:05] that is when the voice of God begins to
[53:08] because the voice of God puts everything
[53:09] into
[53:11] place you know after the voice of God
[53:13] came into the heart of man he he began
[53:15] Paul began to put together and show why
[53:18] what circumcision really was that
[53:20] circumcision was a circumcision of the
[53:22] heart to take away all the the all the
[53:25] doubt all the unbelief and excise it
[53:28] from you so that
[53:30] there's it's a sign to the believer a
[53:33] seal that shows that something has been
[53:35] done because where once you doubted now
[53:39] you're standing upon God's word and
[53:40] believing it now you have an anchor
[53:42] something to hold where
[53:45] before uh you you wishy-washy you uh
[53:48] went back and forth you know one day you
[53:51] were uh on High Ground the next on on
[53:53] the you like an airplane
[53:55] Christian but when you get that when the
[53:58] voice of God came in on the day of
[54:00] Pentecost and began Peter quickly ran
[54:03] down because the voice of God speaking
[54:05] into him told him what the Keys of the
[54:07] Kingdom were and he said repent every
[54:09] one of you be baptized in the name of
[54:10] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[54:12] of your
[54:15] sin that voice of God and that the
[54:18] circumcision became was a sign it's a
[54:21] sign to the believer that something is
[54:23] taking place and what follows that sign
[54:26] of the circumcision I believe is a voice
[54:28] that's echoing out in the heart of the
[54:30] believer to show to to bring to you
[54:32] remembrance to show you things to come
[54:35] to show you where danger lies ahead to
[54:38] show you my wife was talking about um
[54:41] the I don't know if you heard that about
[54:43] that shooting that happened a few six
[54:44] months ago and uh in the little town
[54:48] that we live in this man rolled up on
[54:50] the courthouse and he jumped out and he
[54:52] began to shoot up the place and he ended
[54:54] up getting shot shot by all the
[54:55] policemen what my wife was out and about
[54:58] she was going to the to the post office
[55:01] and a still Small Voice said something's
[55:04] fixing to happen and she saw all the
[55:07] policemen come woring by and going down
[55:09] to the courthouse but there's something
[55:12] that speaks out within you that shows
[55:14] you things are going to happen
[55:16] something's something's not right
[55:18] something uh that that shows you shows
[55:21] you where you're wrong where you're
[55:23] messed up where where your children are
[55:25] wrong what you need to do to them that
[55:28] that it's a guide to you a guide to your
[55:30] life where would we be without that
[55:33] guide to show you to show you what you
[55:35] need to do where you need to go to
[55:37] church what you need to uh how you need
[55:41] to dress how you need to act how you how
[55:43] you conduct
[55:45] yourself and whether or not you compare
[55:47] with God's
[55:49] word because every sign has a
[55:52] voice Philippians 3 3 says for we are
[55:55] the circumcision which worship God in
[55:58] the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus
[56:00] and have no confidence in the flesh
[56:02] right Romans 4:11 says and he received
[56:05] the sign of circumcision a seal of the
[56:07] righteousness of the faith which he had
[56:10] yet being uncircumcised that he might be
[56:12] the father of all them that believe
[56:14] though they be not circumcised that
[56:16] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[56:18] also and brother brandham said I just
[56:20] put a little quote of cutting off all
[56:23] doubts and unbelief to believe God's
[56:25] word is pure and holy and it's the truth
[56:29] circumcision cutting away all unbelief
[56:32] amen everything Cutting Loose every
[56:34] Shoreline saying God I believe you live
[56:36] or die sink or drown it's your word I
[56:40] believe
[56:41] it when you got that seal of the sign of
[56:46] circumcision and then that voice of God
[56:48] begins to speak out then you compare
[56:51] that voice that speaks out in your life
[56:53] with the urum thumb of God's word and
[56:55] see if it's right because that voice
[56:58] that spoke out the the voice of the
[57:00] messenger of our day we had to compare
[57:03] had to compare everything that he said
[57:05] back with the Yum thumm now that voice
[57:07] that speak out from your heart that's
[57:09] how you know it's if it's the voice of
[57:11] God or the voice of the devil is that
[57:13] you can pair it back and see if it's a
[57:15] voice of distraction or if it's a voice
[57:17] that takes you back to the things of
[57:19] God's word makes you continue to grow
[57:21] and progress and and grow more and more
[57:25] closer to God more these virtues are
[57:27] birthed into into you through the
[57:29] opening of God's word and that's
[57:32] how that's how you get the voice of God
[57:35] to sound is by eating eating eat more
[57:39] and more of God's word and he'll open it
[57:41] up to you eat it and he'll bring it to
[57:43] your knowledge and understanding eat and
[57:46] eat I it you know that was like a little
[57:50] Discovery for me one time is that the
[57:53] more you read the the more can be open
[57:55] to you the more you study
[57:59] but oh God is so good
[58:04] glory John 16:13 how be it when he the
[58:09] spirit of Truth is come right it he will
[58:12] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[58:14] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[58:17] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[58:19] will show you things to come amen that's
[58:23] the voice of God in life the voice of
[58:25] God speaking to you how rare it is that
[58:28] brother Brown talked about it's so rare
[58:31] that you Elijah thought that there was
[58:35] there was nobody else that heard the
[58:37] voice of God what about today when it
[58:40] seems like people
[58:41] are after sitting in churches for years
[58:44] and years and years and hearing the
[58:47] voice of God being preached to them
[58:50] being spoken to them hearing the tapes
[58:53] singing the songs but they never heard
[58:56] the voice of God right right and there
[59:00] we don't get second chances to hear the
[59:02] voice of
[59:05] God you know you never know when your
[59:07] time might
[59:10] come we were talking the other day about
[59:13] how brother brandham said that uh
[59:16] brother Bram talked about how when one
[59:17] of his family members were about to pass
[59:20] then the Lord would show him and it's
[59:23] just striking how many in office you
[59:25] know went quickly you
[59:28] know people people leave the Earth all
[59:30] the time there's no Second Chances now
[59:34] is the day of Deliverance right now is
[59:36] the time to
[59:43] choose because God said that he would
[59:45] write his laws on the table of our
[59:47] hearts you take them from the pages of
[59:50] his word and write them on law on the
[59:53] table of our hearts
[59:55] and I I feel like I'm kind of winding
[59:57] down a little bit so let me just before
[59:59] we
[1:00:04] close I want to just finish
[1:00:06] up I guess we'll finish a little early
[1:00:10] tonight and we'll read a few a few more
[1:00:14] quotes just to kind of nail it together
[1:00:16] because you know my message has to
[1:00:20] compare with the prophet's message
[1:00:22] that's right which Compares with Paul's
[1:00:25] message all the way down through and if
[1:00:28] anything that I say does not compare
[1:00:31] then there's a problem right and so
[1:00:35] let's read let's look at number
[1:00:37] three let's look at number three the
[1:00:39] voice of God in this last
[1:00:45] days I hear somebody that was raised on
[1:00:49] theology that his mama had Moses mama
[1:00:52] had set him on her knee and
[1:00:55] told told him all about who he was and
[1:00:57] explained to him the theology explain to
[1:01:01] him about the message and he had heard
[1:01:04] it his whole life and we when he got
[1:01:06] older he thought well I understand
[1:01:08] enough to take matters into my own hands
[1:01:11] but then God had other ideas and he went
[1:01:14] off into the Wilderness until he was 80
[1:01:16] years old now let's see what brother
[1:01:18] Brown has to say about the voice of God
[1:01:19] in this last days paragraph 86 Moses
[1:01:23] heard the voice of God
[1:01:25] he was full of
[1:01:27] theology he knowed all the ins and outs
[1:01:29] but it failed he heard the voice of God
[1:01:31] Moses was never the same and no man is
[1:01:35] never the same you might hear in your
[1:01:36] ears the voice speaking but when you
[1:01:38] hear in your heart the voice speaking
[1:01:41] see then you're
[1:01:45] hearing and just the way he said this on
[1:01:48] the tape he slowed down and said it real
[1:01:52] slow so the people could get it the
[1:01:56] message that I was listening
[1:01:58] anyway you do not see with your eye you
[1:02:02] look with your eye you see with your
[1:02:03] heart you see something say I just don't
[1:02:06] see it you mean you don't understand it
[1:02:10] you do not hear with your ears you hear
[1:02:12] with your heart many times your ears
[1:02:15] hears the true voice of God and it falls
[1:02:17] off of you like water off of a duck's
[1:02:19] back but when you really hear you hear
[1:02:22] with your heart right and all this is
[1:02:25] this is the kicker the point all the
[1:02:29] theology that Moses had he hadn't heard
[1:02:33] the voice of God you can sit in a
[1:02:36] message Church all of your life you can
[1:02:39] have the Seven Seals written down in
[1:02:41] little notes and all ordered up you can
[1:02:44] have Daniel 70 weeks all scribbled and
[1:02:47] just ordered up in a little binder and
[1:02:49] everything you can have all the theology
[1:02:51] straightened out in a little notebook
[1:02:54] all organized with little alphabetical
[1:02:57] things along the side all arranged just
[1:03:00] so that you can show to all your friends
[1:03:02] and flip through and pull out notes to
[1:03:04] impress about how much you know but
[1:03:06] without the voice of God without the new
[1:03:09] birth right it's just tinkling symbols
[1:03:12] it's just tinkling sounding brass and
[1:03:14] tinkling
[1:03:15] symbols what good does it do to impress
[1:03:18] somebody CU they don't impress the devil
[1:03:20] the devil knows whether you've got the
[1:03:22] voice of God inside of you or not
[1:03:25] and he said that script there scriptures
[1:03:27] that says that they shall cast out
[1:03:29] devils in my name and all these other
[1:03:31] things you've got to have the voice of
[1:03:33] God in your life you that that doesn't
[1:03:36] come by just theology but by a real
[1:03:40] experience where you know who you know
[1:03:46] amen but one day God called this
[1:03:49] 80-year-old sheep herter over to one
[1:03:52] side and spoke to him and he called it
[1:03:54] he proved that he was God first thing he
[1:03:57] done to Moses was vindicate his word I'm
[1:04:01] going down I remember what I promised
[1:04:03] that's right and that's the first thing
[1:04:05] he does when he gives you the baptism of
[1:04:07] the Holy Ghost say vindicate his word by
[1:04:09] making the things that were written
[1:04:11] about the New Birth come to life in you
[1:04:15] making it be manifested in you every
[1:04:17] promise every scripture in the Bible is
[1:04:20] mine because he gave it to me it's it's
[1:04:23] written that same voice that wrote the
[1:04:25] Bible is now echoing in our lives if
[1:04:28] you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:30] the new birth number four Abraham's
[1:04:33] Covenant confirm confirmed what's the
[1:04:36] matter with me anyhow I'm only telling
[1:04:38] you the truth someday you'll catch it
[1:04:41] someday you'll know that I've told you
[1:04:43] the truth amen my voice may be
[1:04:47] silent you might might be able to
[1:04:49] silence the body that's speaking but
[1:04:51] you'll never silence that voice it comes
[1:04:54] from God they ston Stephen but they
[1:04:56] couldn't stop his message it'll move
[1:05:00] on you know I never really understood
[1:05:04] what it we were let me let me let me
[1:05:08] back up a
[1:05:09] second we were my wife and I spent a a a
[1:05:13] night with this little widow woman uh a
[1:05:16] while back and she was talking about how
[1:05:18] her husband had deceased and how that he
[1:05:21] had such a great testimony while he was
[1:05:23] living
[1:05:24] and now that he's gone she still is
[1:05:28] telling his
[1:05:30] testimony and it it his testimony his
[1:05:34] Revelation continues to live on and you
[1:05:37] know when she says that something struck
[1:05:39] me and I remembered out it says that
[1:05:42] Abel's blood spoke from the ground right
[1:05:45] because he had a revelation and when he
[1:05:48] died he gave his life for it even though
[1:05:51] he was dead that Revelation continued to
[1:05:53] speak amen
[1:05:54] and his Revelation was that blood blood
[1:05:58] was involved that something had to die
[1:06:01] something had to pay the price and think
[1:06:04] about how long that Revelation continued
[1:06:07] to speak for 4,000 years it continued to
[1:06:11] cry out until the blood of Jesus spoke
[1:06:15] better things and what does it speak it
[1:06:17] speaks a new life when Jesus died and
[1:06:20] went into the ground that blood the life
[1:06:24] that was in that blood now speaking
[1:06:26] through his bride speaking in US it
[1:06:29] speaks better things a circumcised life
[1:06:32] circumcised from the things of the world
[1:06:35] that now you can believe and have faith
[1:06:37] in God because he's living inside of us
[1:06:40] showing us things to come and
[1:06:43] uh that's right showing us things that
[1:06:47] cannot even be expressed by words
[1:06:53] that
[1:06:57] let's
[1:06:58] um let's see let's look at number five
[1:07:03] Lakeport
[1:07:06] California and scroll on down to the
[1:07:08] highlighted part brother when you want
[1:07:11] sit still enough and listen till you can
[1:07:15] hear that still small voice of Christ is
[1:07:18] different from any message you ever
[1:07:21] heard in your
[1:07:22] life and you can listen to the that's
[1:07:25] what I'm going to keep saying it you can
[1:07:27] listen to the books the the tapes read
[1:07:30] the Bible but until when you get that
[1:07:32] voice of God that speaks back that
[1:07:35] Echoes back what's written on the books
[1:07:37] and the tapes what's what you're hearing
[1:07:40] then it becomes a different message it
[1:07:43] becomes a different book right it
[1:07:46] becomes something that you couldn't even
[1:07:49] have fathomed before the voice of God
[1:07:52] began to speak in your life
[1:07:55] it's different from any message you ever
[1:07:57] heard in your life it brings a peace it
[1:08:01] brings a satisfaction it does something
[1:08:04] to you that stirs your innermost being
[1:08:06] you're never the same right man cannot
[1:08:10] meet God and talk with God and ever
[1:08:14] remain the same
[1:08:18] again I if I if there was a way that I
[1:08:21] could last night I was praying and I God
[1:08:24] if there was a way to take from me
[1:08:26] something and give it to you that you
[1:08:28] could see then I would be willing to do
[1:08:31] that if there was a way to convince the
[1:08:33] young people that there was something
[1:08:35] more real than the comic books and the
[1:08:37] Thors and the Superman there's a
[1:08:39] Superman that gave his life for you
[1:08:42] that's more real than anything than
[1:08:44] you'll get out of a comic book if you'll
[1:08:46] give your life to God he'll makes he'll
[1:08:48] make something of your life more than
[1:08:50] you could have ever imagined he'll take
[1:08:53] you out of the dunk he and make you a
[1:08:55] vessel of Honor instead of a vessel Of
[1:08:56] Dishonor if you'll listen to the voice
[1:08:59] of God he'll show you that you're a
[1:09:00] vessel Of Dishonor and bring to your
[1:09:04] just just show
[1:09:07] you I can't even express it Lord help me
[1:09:14] right let's go to number six the voice
[1:09:16] of the
[1:09:22] son actually I'm sorry I'm I'm going to
[1:09:24] just skip over that one he's talking
[1:09:26] about what the new birth is let's go to
[1:09:28] number
[1:09:29] seven every true sign is followed by the
[1:09:32] voice of God and and this is what I was
[1:09:35] talking about the the Deep calling to
[1:09:37] the Deep when you listen in church when
[1:09:39] you sit in church there's a transmitter
[1:09:41] and their receiver when you listen to
[1:09:42] the tapes there's a transmitter and a
[1:09:45] receiver and he was the transmitter that
[1:09:48] said he that heareth my words and
[1:09:49] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:09:51] eternal life see verily I say unto you
[1:09:53] that that he that heareth my words and
[1:09:55] believeth on him that sent me ha eternal
[1:09:57] life now that word has went out from a
[1:10:01] transmitter he said one day verily I say
[1:10:05] unto you if you say to this mountain be
[1:10:07] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:10:08] believe that what you have said will
[1:10:10] come to pass you can have what you said
[1:10:12] that's
[1:10:13] right and he said that same thing in the
[1:10:16] in the voice in that in that sermon I
[1:10:18] was listening to the voice in this last
[1:10:20] agage
[1:10:22] he because you know know it's so hard
[1:10:24] for us to wrap our mind around it the
[1:10:26] promises of God are true if you really
[1:10:29] believe it if God has revealed it to you
[1:10:31] then you can have what you will because
[1:10:33] your motives and objectives are lined up
[1:10:34] right with God's word and and that's
[1:10:37] what you know it sounds it sounds
[1:10:38] strange when you tell somebody that if
[1:10:40] you have faith to be healed it's yours
[1:10:43] that the Lord said I I am the Lord that
[1:10:46] Health all thy
[1:10:48] diseases if you can believe all of the
[1:10:51] promises of God are yours for the the
[1:10:53] taking if we can just believe and that's
[1:10:55] our problem is something's blocking our
[1:10:58] faith now if paragraph 116 now if you
[1:11:02] can just be the station to pick that up
[1:11:06] by some control inside of you by faith
[1:11:09] it'll move you right into the cycle of
[1:11:11] God to the new birth and be born again
[1:11:14] then you'll always be in contact to hear
[1:11:16] that voice that will always warn you
[1:11:19] when danger is alone now think about
[1:11:21] that you'll always be in contact right
[1:11:25] to hear that voice that will always warn
[1:11:27] you when danger is long when things are
[1:11:30] wrong going wrong it'll always be a
[1:11:33] warning to you and then instead of
[1:11:36] someday being like that rich young boy
[1:11:38] that we're speaking of be a man like
[1:11:40] Apostle Peter Paul or somebody that one
[1:11:43] souls for Jesus
[1:11:49] Christen number
[1:11:52] eight and I'm going to finish in just a
[1:11:54] minute here y'all bear with
[1:11:57] me Jesus might have said now in order to
[1:12:00] get back to the original God has to
[1:12:03] speak
[1:12:04] again that's what he does when he gives
[1:12:07] you the new birth amen your old life is
[1:12:10] gone and you're back to the original
[1:12:13] word of the Lord right if you're not
[1:12:16] you're hybrid into Church's
[1:12:18] denominations but when God speaks his
[1:12:20] peace and the Holy Spirit then your back
[1:12:24] in the original family of God again you
[1:12:27] don't have to be baby then you're a
[1:12:29] rugged Christian who can stand
[1:12:32] it go to the Cross go to the fire
[1:12:34] furnace to the Lion's Den or wherever it
[1:12:36] might be because the word of the Living
[1:12:38] God burning in your heart and soul and
[1:12:40] all can
[1:12:42] backslide all can turn against you and
[1:12:45] everything else but that won't stop one
[1:12:48] thing that rugged word of God stays
[1:12:51] right there when he spoke that original
[1:12:52] voice into your heart you are
[1:12:57] mine that's
[1:12:59] right let's look at one
[1:13:02] more the voice of the sign number
[1:13:07] nine I I'm sorry let's skip let's go to
[1:13:10] number
[1:13:11] 10 I'm trying to save a little
[1:13:16] time hear his
[1:13:19] voice let's go down to paragraph
[1:13:22] 80
[1:13:24] now there's a Code of Ethics to it God
[1:13:26] has a new birth for you but listen to
[1:13:28] his still Small Voice every one of you
[1:13:31] people who profess to be Christians get
[1:13:33] yourself quiet before
[1:13:35] him now that's the ones that have been
[1:13:39] listening to the theology but have not
[1:13:42] yet heard from the voice of
[1:13:44] God those that profess to be Christian I
[1:13:48] am a Christian but I haven't if if you
[1:13:51] say I am a Christian but I have not yet
[1:13:53] yet heard the voice of
[1:13:55] God and you know maybe there's some that
[1:13:57] don't realize they haven't heard from
[1:13:59] the voice of God right which is why he's
[1:14:02] saying get yourself quiet before him
[1:14:05] like Charles finny who thought you know
[1:14:08] he was a preacher he prayed every day he
[1:14:13] understood the Theology of the Bible but
[1:14:15] yet there wasn't there was something
[1:14:17] lacking in his
[1:14:19] life you know a lot of times like those
[1:14:22] two little sisters just it's easy ident
[1:14:24] to identify someone
[1:14:27] that has not yet heard you know that the
[1:14:32] conversation is just different there's
[1:14:34] something lacking in the uh there's
[1:14:38] something lacking as far as Faith
[1:14:40] there's you
[1:14:45] know well here's what he says every one
[1:14:47] of you people who profess to be
[1:14:48] Christians get yourself quiet before him
[1:14:52] don't let the washing hand hinder all
[1:14:54] those voices that distract from the real
[1:14:57] voice of God don't let the work hinder
[1:14:59] don't let nothing
[1:15:00] hinder don't let nobody know what you're
[1:15:03] doing just go before him get up in the
[1:15:06] woods somewhere get out on the side of
[1:15:09] the road go into the secret closet and
[1:15:12] close the door when the kids gets at
[1:15:14] school they get down on your knees
[1:15:18] you've heard all kinds of voices
[1:15:20] everywhere but just get down and stop
[1:15:23] stay there until those voices are
[1:15:25] silenced and you begin to lift up it'll
[1:15:28] change you it'll make you different like
[1:15:31] it did this little Samuel it'll do
[1:15:33] something to you if you'll just do it
[1:15:36] now it'll make you what you should
[1:15:38] be it'll make you the kind of Christian
[1:15:41] that you ought to
[1:15:46] be and I'll kind of stop
[1:15:51] there you know you've got to
[1:15:54] hear the voice of God won't sound
[1:15:57] forever I we were talking at work I've
[1:16:01] got some people on my team that work in
[1:16:03] San Francisco and we were talking about
[1:16:06] that big earthquake that just happened
[1:16:08] and uh you know all these things are
[1:16:12] signs Jesus talked about how that you
[1:16:14] can you can look at outside the color of
[1:16:16] the sky at night and see that that you
[1:16:19] know when the when the when it's red at
[1:16:21] night you know what they say sailor's
[1:16:23] light red in the morning sailor take
[1:16:26] warning you can look outside and just
[1:16:28] tell by the signs of nature that
[1:16:31] something's happening and you can look
[1:16:33] and see that Google's now got their
[1:16:35] little egg-shaped car this they' passed
[1:16:38] laws in California and around the world
[1:16:40] that these little egg shaped cars can
[1:16:42] drive by themselves and they're
[1:16:43] beginning to test them out and you know
[1:16:46] that's what that that believe the sign
[1:16:47] website says that there are no
[1:16:49] egg-shaped cars well I've got news for
[1:16:51] you all you got to do is go to
[1:16:52] google.com and type in egg-shaped car
[1:16:55] and you'll get back a long list of
[1:16:58] egg-shaped cars many of which can drive
[1:17:01] themselves and now there's earthquakes
[1:17:04] that are shaking all around the world
[1:17:05] and signs are happening but the real way
[1:17:11] that you know something is happening is
[1:17:13] because God's word is being fulfilled
[1:17:16] God's word is being brought to
[1:17:20] pass and the evidence is The Voice the
[1:17:23] voice of God in this last days the voice
[1:17:25] of God that's echoing in my heart now I
[1:17:28] wonder if we'll stand and and maybe just
[1:17:30] think about as I asked you when we
[1:17:33] started think about when you first heard
[1:17:36] that voice and if you never heard the
[1:17:39] voice if you just have been to church
[1:17:41] and you've heard the theology then
[1:17:43] there's a remedy for that that brother
[1:17:45] brandom his own words just the voice of
[1:17:48] our messenger called out and told us the
[1:17:52] remedy for that that is to get along
[1:17:54] with God get along with God like Charles
[1:17:56] finny realizing there's something wrong
[1:17:59] in your life something wrong that
[1:18:01] there's an answer for there's a bomb in
[1:18:02] Gilead like Jeremiah said is there no
[1:18:04] bomb in Gilead is there no Sav for the
[1:18:09] problem for the Affliction there is a
[1:18:11] bomb amen so let's just stand our feet
[1:18:14] and I'm going to pray a prayer over you
[1:18:17] and then turn the service back over to
[1:18:18] brother
[1:18:19] Dale cuz we believe that God's word is
[1:18:22] true amen and amen everything that's
[1:18:26] written in God's word at the end of that
[1:18:28] sermon brother brandham said um
[1:18:31] everything that's been spoken will come
[1:18:32] to pass right all the things that are in
[1:18:35] God's word have to come to pass right
[1:18:38] and I want to be one of the ones that
[1:18:41] believes it that it can be made
[1:18:43] manifest let's just go to the Lord in
[1:18:45] prayer Lord
[1:18:47] God you see every hungering heart Lord
[1:18:51] Jesus every needful Heart Lord Lord God
[1:18:53] and I pray God that even through my
[1:18:56] stammering lips and and stuttering and
[1:18:59] uh staggering around and not knowing how
[1:19:01] to say Lord that something was said to
[1:19:03] help Lord God and not to hinder Lord
[1:19:06] Jesus but I pray oh God that as my voice
[1:19:08] went out Lord God is is the words that I
[1:19:11] said the words that I spoke Lord that
[1:19:13] they'll drop down and Lord God that
[1:19:15] you'll bring it bring it to life Lord
[1:19:17] Jesus bring to life your words Lord
[1:19:19] Jesus and I pray oh God that the voice
[1:19:22] of God and the believer's hearts Lord
[1:19:24] Jesus would just Echo back and cause
[1:19:27] your word to be made manifest in them
[1:19:29] Lord Jesus that's all of our desire
[1:19:32] that's my desire Lord Jesus to see your
[1:19:34] word made manifest in my life Lord that
[1:19:37] you'll take away all the doubt and all
[1:19:39] the fear that you'll circumcise every
[1:19:42] bit of unbelief from our lives Lord
[1:19:44] Jesus make us Lord as the As It Seems
[1:19:48] like people are dropping off Lord help
[1:19:50] us to be more steadfast and more true
[1:19:54] and more true to you Lord God more
