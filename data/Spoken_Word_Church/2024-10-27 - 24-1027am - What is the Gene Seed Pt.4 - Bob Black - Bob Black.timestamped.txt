[0:06] one second I was asking me to
[0:08] pay I've already paid my
[0:13] dues let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord
[0:15] God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:17] gather together around your word this
[0:18] morning Lord we ask Lord that you'll
[0:19] bless us today prepare our hearts and
[0:22] our minds to receive what you have for
[0:24] us today Lord and I pray God that you'll
[0:26] just have Liberty to be with us Grant it
[0:29] Lord now that you'll guide through your
[0:30] word we ask in your name
[0:33] amen now we've been uh uh and I sure
[0:37] appreciate the brothers filling in the
[0:39] last couple of Sundays um uh while we're
[0:42] while we're
[0:44] traveling more than a couple
[0:47] wasn't at any rate we sure appreciate
[0:50] that um sure appreciate everything they
[0:54] brought and we're uh going through uh
[0:59] just this thought what is what is that
[1:00] genan
[1:02] seed and in Romans 9:13 we were reading
[1:05] the scripture as it is written Jacob
[1:07] have I loved but Esau have I
[1:11] hated and uh that's quoting the
[1:14] scripture in Malachi chapter one that
[1:16] says I have loved you sayith the Lord
[1:18] yet you say wherein hast thou loved us
[1:20] was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the
[1:22] Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau
[1:24] and laid his mountains and his Heritage
[1:26] waste for the dragons of the Wilderness
[1:28] so now just really want to just re
[1:32] rehash some things because I know
[1:35] repetition helps but really want to nail
[1:37] down what what is what is it what really
[1:40] what is it and we're so we're talking
[1:42] about you know really meditate on why
[1:45] why did Jacob love what why did God love
[1:48] Jacob and hate Esau before the world was
[1:52] created before anything was acted out
[1:55] and it all hinges on this concept of
[1:57] forn
[1:58] knowledge that God before the the
[2:00] foundation of the world could could look
[2:01] and see um not just how you would
[2:04] respond at a specific situation but how
[2:07] you would always respond no matter where
[2:09] whether he put you in this age or this
[2:11] age or wherever whatever age that you're
[2:14] you would always
[2:16] respond now I got kind of a little
[2:18] exercise I want to do this morning so
[2:21] it's only going to take 5 seconds and
[2:23] I'm going to need some audience
[2:24] participation don't get scared you won't
[2:26] have to do nothing or say nothing except
[2:28] just come up and and uh and receive
[2:32] these envelopes that I got already
[2:33] written out with some brothers names on
[2:37] them now now we're playing out an
[2:39] exercise here so that you really get it
[2:41] I already got these names written
[2:42] out and then I'm going to call your name
[2:44] out now think about you sitting in the
[2:46] service and the gospel is being
[2:49] preached and it's it's like your name is
[2:51] being called out and and you've got the
[2:54] option to respond or not but I already
[2:56] got the names written now now Terrence I
[2:59] got an envelope up for you so if you
[3:00] just come up and get it that's all you
[3:02] got to do is just come get
[3:05] it and I got one for you brother
[3:11] Louise there's a scripture in it and you
[3:15] can read that as your leisure it's just
[3:17] a scripture and I got one for you
[3:19] brother
[3:22] Ryan now how could I write that down in
[3:26] advance cuz I knew in advance that you
[3:29] would want it
[3:30] and you'd come get it sorry they had it
[3:32] written down for you now there there's
[3:35] nailing down what what is that genan c
[3:38] it's already there for you and now now
[3:41] that ties into everything all these deep
[3:44] things that's the Lamb's Book of Life he
[3:47] already wrote your name down because he
[3:49] knew that that when you were presented
[3:51] with it that you would respond to it now
[3:55] now let's look at it from the other side
[3:56] of the coin did I did I force you to
[3:58] take it did I go up there and and put
[4:01] you in a headlock and and and Wrangle
[4:03] you to the front you better take it no
[4:06] it's totally it's totally up to you
[4:09] right and and nobody's forced to do
[4:12] nothing was there something inherent did
[4:14] did you already have like the envelope
[4:16] in you somehow or in your possession no
[4:20] no it wasn't already in your possession
[4:22] but it was there waiting on you and so
[4:25] that's where you frame up these these
[4:28] these uh kind of hard to understand
[4:30] Concepts that brother brand was present
[4:31] when he say well the reason the reason
[4:34] you wanted it is because it was already
[4:36] there but it was already there because
[4:37] he knew you'd want it that's right see
[4:39] the reason it's actually drawing you
[4:41] that that when I give you that
[4:43] invitation it's actually it's it's it's
[4:47] it's drawing you cuz God knew that you
[4:48] would want it so brother Rand would say
[4:51] he'd say your your life now you're what
[4:55] you're living out right right there
[4:58] right right now is is the thought that
[5:00] God had before the foundation of the
[5:02] world right so it's that envelope that I
[5:05] had in my possession that I already got
[5:06] your name written on it I got a little
[5:08] scripture for you so that when you open
[5:10] it up you can read that scripture that
[5:12] has something it's got it was a
[5:13] scripture really about predestination
[5:16] and forn knowledge so you open that up
[5:18] it kind of Echoes something in you and
[5:20] that you begin to live that out what was
[5:22] what was known about you from before the
[5:24] foundation of the world so you're
[5:25] actually living out right then right now
[5:27] what what God thought about
[5:30] and he said and knoweth it not he said I
[5:32] was in Christ you were in Christ before
[5:34] the foundation of the world he came to
[5:37] redeem his own his own that was in him
[5:39] Hallelujah his children that was in him
[5:42] now you think about that we're making a
[5:43] little illustration with envelopes but
[5:45] that you were actually such a part of
[5:47] God you're the thought that not not that
[5:49] you were running
[5:50] around I I keep hearing Minister saor we
[5:53] don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of
[5:56] predestination of souls but but we
[5:58] believe in a doctrine of pre uh not a
[6:00] Mor a doctrine of pre-existence of souls
[6:02] but we believe in a doctrine of
[6:03] pre-existence of souls no we don't frame
[6:07] it up like that you're not running
[6:08] around we don't believe in any doctrine
[6:10] of pre-existence of souls it's the the
[6:12] way that brother R said that is because
[6:13] he's framing up the Mormons are the ones
[6:15] that kind of put that out there but it's
[6:18] not that you as an individual are
[6:19] running around back there but that you
[6:22] the thought of God was uh God had a
[6:25] thought of you that was so much a part
[6:27] of him until it well it was a part of
[6:29] him it's an eternal part of him Eternal
[6:32] attribute that was going to be expressed
[6:35] sooner or later right amen so you were
[6:39] in Christ before the foundation of the
[6:41] world he came to redeem his own his own
[6:44] that was in him Allelujah his children
[6:46] that was in
[6:48] him so then we got those two those two
[6:51] extremes that we read about in in
[6:54] Matthew Chapter 13 I I wonder maybe just
[6:56] pose the question did anybody read
[6:58] Matthew chapter 13
[7:01] God bless you now now there's there's
[7:04] the struggle of a minister church is not
[7:06] just about coming to CH you got to go
[7:08] home and meditate and think about it
[7:10] that's why I'm I'm expressing these
[7:11] things so you go home and open up
[7:13] Matthew 13 and sit there and look at it
[7:16] and think about it and read those two
[7:18] Parables and and think and and and sit
[7:21] and look and and these two extremes are
[7:24] exactly what we just acted out there's
[7:26] an envelope that already written out but
[7:29] then there's a time when you got to
[7:30] receive it and so the first Parable or
[7:33] the uh it's actually the last Parable in
[7:35] verse 38 where that the swer went forth
[7:38] to seow and the good seed are the
[7:40] children of the Kingdom in other words
[7:41] there's attributes there in God that are
[7:43] already pre-written out that are are are
[7:46] waiting to be man manifest but then the
[7:49] other end of that spectrum is that he
[7:51] that receiv receives seed into the good
[7:53] ground is he that heareth the word so
[7:55] what are you hearing you're hearing that
[7:57] Eternal part of God that's expressed
[8:00] here in time that God come down and
[8:02] through a minister through a prophet
[8:04] preached the word and it expresses what
[8:07] go was in God all the way back before
[8:09] the foundation of the world in other
[8:11] words you're heing the word what's
[8:13] what's the what's the gene seed of God
[8:15] it's the word the thought of God the
[8:18] part of God right that was in him from
[8:20] the beginning yes now so we've got these
[8:24] two extremes in Matthew 13:38 and
[8:26] Matthew 13:23 really what what are these
[8:29] two extremes that's Calvinism and
[8:31] Armenian ISM brother Bob you getting too
[8:34] beep hold on Calvinism says well it it's
[8:38] just so much grace that God said these
[8:40] are going to be saved and these are
[8:41] going to be lost and and and that's the
[8:43] end of the story and then Armenian ISM
[8:45] on the other end is that you're it's
[8:47] what you do here in time you're acting
[8:49] it out and you but the truth lies
[8:52] between these two
[8:53] extremes that the Calvinism P part of it
[8:56] is that if there's an envelope for you
[8:59] you can't get away from it but the
[9:01] envelope is there cuz God knew that you
[9:03] would want it and you put those two
[9:05] together and then you got the truth of
[9:07] it Calvinism is that eternal security
[9:10] that before creation God the way they
[9:13] look at it the calvinist that God
[9:14] actively decreed who would be saved and
[9:17] lost and and of course that extreme
[9:20] Calvinism view is God predestines purely
[9:23] based on God's Sovereign will and good
[9:25] pleasure and then on the other hand
[9:27] Armenian ism is it's human choose who to
[9:30] AC to accept God and salvation is
[9:33] completely dependent on human effort but
[9:36] the to link those two together you got
[9:39] to have four knowledge right now that's
[9:41] why the the message is different than
[9:42] the way pretty much any other
[9:44] denomination looks at things because of
[9:47] this of this thought of of forn
[9:49] knowledge that links these two together
[9:51] that God can predestinate by knowing in
[9:54] advance what you're going to do and how
[9:56] you're going to react which is why
[9:57] brother R would say God by his for
[9:59] knowledge saw exactly who would be saved
[10:01] and who wouldn't be saved so so uh we're
[10:05] really clenching down it was there was
[10:07] there a little glowing piece of light
[10:09] down in you when you were born of your
[10:11] natural birth
[10:12] no but but there was a thought of God
[10:15] that he had about you that was waiting
[10:17] to be manifested so for knowledge
[10:20] affirms that doctrine of for knowledge
[10:22] affirms both human
[10:24] responsibility and God's sovereignty and
[10:27] Grace So predestination comes as a
[10:30] result of for knowledge not arbitrary
[10:34] Choice that's why brother R would make
[10:36] that statement predestination looks back
[10:38] to forn
[10:39] knowledge how does God know how where
[10:43] where to put his Angel to guide your
[10:44] life and where which one to breed to
[10:47] which and uh what family to put you in
[10:50] and all the situations in life where how
[10:52] how to influence your life
[10:54] predestination looks to for knowledge so
[10:57] he can look down to see how you're going
[10:58] to respond to situations and for
[11:01] knowledge looks to Destiny Destiny is
[11:04] what you going to do what you going to
[11:06] do with that envelope for knowledge
[11:08] looks to Destiny so
[11:10] predestination having that envelope to
[11:13] begin with looks to how what you're
[11:15] going to do with that envelope now the
[11:17] whole thing F hinges to for knowledge
[11:20] but it also hinges on free will this
[11:24] concept that you are in control
[11:30] there there's nobody going to force you
[11:32] to do anything I I I was really I I've
[11:34] been meditating on on control and how
[11:38] the devil almost He he'll come in and
[11:40] he'll use use a he'll try to control
[11:43] things sometimes by pretending to
[11:46] know in advance what's going to
[11:50] happen you know you see like a little
[11:52] sister that she's talking to a young boy
[11:54] and he'll come in and he'll say he'll
[11:56] try to manipulate things and he'll say
[11:57] well I'll tell you I'll tell you right
[11:59] right
[12:00] now we're supposed to get
[12:02] married and you know I was I was
[12:04] thinking this morning even just just
[12:06] saying something like that that
[12:09] sometimes people's response is well how
[12:10] do you what if he really does know that
[12:13] you're supposed to get
[12:16] married let things play out there's a
[12:19] lot of other things to look at than just
[12:21] just whether somebody knows what's going
[12:23] to happen or whether somebody has some
[12:25] kind of premonition or something that
[12:27] because look you you you got to
[12:30] the whole thing is based on God God
[12:32] takes his hands off of the situation and
[12:35] lets you make your own decision right
[12:38] God takes his hands off of it and does
[12:40] not try to control whenever you've got
[12:43] control of a situation even like like
[12:45] parents sometimes they'll they want to
[12:47] get their hands all they see their kids
[12:49] struggling trying to come to God and
[12:51] they they want to get their hands in
[12:52] there and and and and and have something
[12:54] where they can say well I had something
[12:56] to do with it or whatever but some so
[12:59] many times if you'll just take your
[13:01] hands off of it because if you've got
[13:04] your hands in it then God can't do what
[13:07] he wants to
[13:08] do like that story of of uh of brother
[13:12] brandham uh you know we want to see his
[13:14] son Billy Paul saved and and and the
[13:17] spirit gets to moveing and draw in Billy
[13:18] Paul and next thing you know here's a
[13:20] deacon tapping on his shoulder and the
[13:23] Deacon tapping on his shoulder why don't
[13:25] you go up to the altar just mess
[13:28] everything up just trying trying to get
[13:31] in
[13:32] control to have to for God to get in
[13:35] control we got to take our hands off the
[13:37] situation and let God do what he wants
[13:39] to do and you know really that's that's
[13:42] what what we're trying to do in church
[13:44] is is set up things so that God can have
[13:46] Liberty to do where that we're not
[13:48] controlled by fear or by by any kind of
[13:51] coercion or something that we can just
[13:53] that God can just do with people the way
[13:55] that they want to do that you're you can
[13:57] worship you can raise your hands and
[13:58] worship you can run down the aisles if
[14:00] you want to do that but there's no fear
[14:02] or anything that's trying to prevent you
[14:04] from do for or prevent the holy ghost
[14:07] from doing what he wants to do you got
[14:09] to take your hands off of it like uh uh
[14:13] thinking of
[14:14] uh uh amram and uh what Moses parents
[14:19] amram and jocked I think were sitting
[14:21] there putting their little baby Moses in
[14:24] the bull rushes and and Aaron was just
[14:27] watching if he could have gone in there
[14:29] and going to stabbing at hippos and done
[14:31] all kinds of things but it would have
[14:32] messed the whole plan of God up if he
[14:34] tried to guide that little thing through
[14:36] that little bassinet through the through
[14:38] the bull rushes but if you just take
[14:39] your hands off of it and let God do
[14:42] every do what he wants to do then
[14:43] everything will work out right this
[14:46] morning I was reading a story uh that
[14:47] story of brother Brandon where he was
[14:51] uh he was talking to that brother Eli I
[14:54] think his name was and they had a little
[14:56] sick boy at home and he was telling him
[14:58] visions of of things that were taking
[14:59] place in his home and and and the man
[15:01] came to the Lord and then he went over
[15:03] to his house and he had a sick boy and
[15:06] and brother Brandon God had showed him a
[15:08] vision that that sick boy was going to
[15:10] be raised up and but uh and he it was
[15:14] like a situation where everything had to
[15:16] fall into place there was the two
[15:17] brothers there and the mom and and and
[15:21] the sick boy laying in the bassinet but
[15:23] he was waiting on the little old lady to
[15:26] come and sit down in the red chair and
[15:29] he jumped the gun cuzz God's not going
[15:31] to force you to do this or that he's
[15:33] going to allow you to do whatever and he
[15:36] jumped the gun and because he didn't
[15:38] wait for things to just fall into place
[15:41] then everything everything fell out of
[15:43] cater and he had to wait for the healing
[15:45] of that child until the morning until
[15:47] the next day
[15:48] and and and you I was thinking as he was
[15:51] relating that story I was actually
[15:54] getting stressed out reading that story
[15:56] cuz he was waiting for everything to
[15:58] fall into place the the sun went around
[16:00] the you know the sun was coming up they
[16:02] had to go to work he was going to be
[16:03] left at home with that little mama and
[16:05] the little baby you know he was waiting
[16:07] for everything to fall into place and he
[16:10] could not put his hand in there and say
[16:13] little old lady you got to sit in this
[16:16] chair that's right he could not go
[16:19] around and try to move things into place
[16:21] you have to wait for things to fall into
[16:24] place in other words and every and we're
[16:27] talking about having the envelope
[16:29] God's got the envelope but he is not
[16:32] going to force you to take it he's not
[16:35] going to force anything to fall into
[16:37] place he's just going to sit back and
[16:38] watch and and everything will fall into
[16:41] place if you just let it just let it
[16:44] fall into place and when we get our
[16:47] hands in there and start trying to move
[16:48] things around and trying to influence I
[16:51] think the worst thing that to do is try
[16:53] to take control of your children's life
[16:55] or your your some some try to get get
[16:58] involved in the best way to get involved
[17:00] is get on our knees and
[17:01] pray and let and let God go to work cuz
[17:05] if you really want to prove out that
[17:07] something is spiritual take your hands
[17:10] off take your hands off every single
[17:13] time and you see God go to
[17:15] work brother R said the God who is rich
[17:17] in Mercy he said many of you can
[17:19] fellowship with me on this
[17:21] thought when you was a little boy or a
[17:23] little girl you would walk around and
[17:24] there would be certain things that would
[17:26] just where it wouldn't bother the other
[17:27] kids it seemed like there was something
[17:28] in you they cried out there was God
[17:30] somewhere yet you were a sinner you
[17:33] remember that certainly now what was
[17:35] that that was that little form of life
[17:37] in you then a little form of life
[17:41] like not not eternal life down in you
[17:44] but the the a a
[17:47] representation that there's something
[17:49] that's going to come up a representation
[17:52] not something
[17:53] substantive but that God knew before the
[17:55] foundation of the world that eternal
[17:57] life was going to spring up in you
[17:59] and then after a while you heard this
[18:01] gospel maybe you went to church you
[18:02] picked out this and that and went from
[18:04] denomination to denomination but one day
[18:07] you being part of God you had to be part
[18:09] of the word and when you heard the word
[18:10] you know where you come from you know
[18:12] what was the truth you were always the
[18:15] seed was in you always what does that
[18:18] mean the seed was in you always is that
[18:21] representation was always there that one
[18:24] day you'd hear the word and it would
[18:26] spring to life what what would spring to
[18:28] life like something already planted the
[18:30] the potential for life to come up would
[18:33] manifest as you heard the word it would
[18:35] Express the word that the here he
[18:38] explains it the word seen the word that
[18:40] was in you that was before the
[18:41] foundation of the world world saw the
[18:44] word and you come to
[18:48] it let skip that one and the message
[18:51] communion he said then look up to the
[18:53] trees and I think Leaf I seen you fall
[18:56] off last year and why are you back there
[18:58] again where didd you come come from what
[18:59] brought you here see it was that eternal
[19:01] life working in the body now then one
[19:04] day as I walked on that voice talking
[19:06] don't never smoke drink so forth and the
[19:09] young fellas and all got older see there
[19:11] was something moving that's what's
[19:13] moving predestination that God's got it
[19:15] God's got that envelope for you he's got
[19:18] everything lined up because he knows
[19:20] that when you hear the word you're going
[19:21] to respond to
[19:23] it but yet all at once I looked up and I
[19:26] said I'm not the son of Charles and El
[19:28] brano
[19:29] there's something
[19:30] calling like my little Eagle I'm not a
[19:33] chicken there's something up yonder
[19:35] somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you
[19:37] are open up I want to come home there's
[19:39] something in me calling then I was born
[19:41] again that little life was laying there
[19:44] the life of water was poured upon it
[19:46] then it began to
[19:50] grow so what's
[19:52] happening the
[19:54] predestinated characteristics or
[19:56] attributes within a believer
[19:59] will emerge as they respond to God's
[20:02] word and
[20:04] spirit that envelope that he had for you
[20:07] before the foundation of the world will
[20:08] come to life when you hear the when you
[20:11] hear what's in the
[20:13] envelope and the God who is rich in
[20:15] Mercy he said I believe that a man when
[20:17] he is born in this world that when
[20:18] you're a little baby born into the world
[20:20] you could not have been here without
[20:21] being the for knowledge of God because
[20:24] he is infinite and knows all things and
[20:27] when that little baby is Born Into the
[20:29] world there is something in that baby if
[20:32] he is ever going to have life there is a
[20:34] little something in there in that child
[20:36] then that he comes to sooner or later
[20:39] that little seed is in him and I'm
[20:43] laying these quotes out so that we don't
[20:44] draw back when you hear a Minister
[20:47] preach this because if you know what it
[20:49] means then you can rejoice and worship
[20:52] you not draw back and say well he I I
[20:55] don't think he believes right but you'll
[20:57] you'll you can Joy I you know
[21:01] if well let me lay that to the
[21:04] side what is that je brother R said in
[21:07] sman church he said be careful here and
[21:09] see this it is not the person that comes
[21:12] predestinated eternally from God it is
[21:14] the word or
[21:15] seed that is it way back there too far
[21:19] back for the human mind to grasp the
[21:22] Eternal god with eternal thoughts
[21:24] thought and decreed Jacob have I loved
[21:27] but Esau have I hated and neither was
[21:30] born and neither had done good or evil
[21:33] see now here's he's laying it out it was
[21:35] the
[21:36] thought and then that thought became
[21:39] expressed and God bought back Jacob
[21:42] because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone
[21:46] had a
[21:47] representation and why did he have a
[21:49] representation because God knew that he
[21:51] would accept it that's right just like
[21:54] Jesus walking to all those disciples and
[21:55] calling them by name your name is Simon
[21:57] and you the son of Jon us and he'd go up
[21:59] to the different disciples and knew
[22:01] exactly who they who they were and what
[22:03] where they would fit into his plan and
[22:05] he said now we know that Jesus told his
[22:08] Apostles that he knew them and he before
[22:09] the foundation of the world they were
[22:11] the attributes of his
[22:13] thoughts and the message identification
[22:15] he said look to show it's the ones that
[22:17] he thought of his thoughts is the
[22:20] Christian of today the thoughts before
[22:23] the foundation of the world now remember
[22:26] man when he was born in sin shaped in an
[22:28] Equity comes to the world speaking lies
[22:30] there is nothing in him at all now
[22:32] there's your quote for you you don't
[22:34] have an envelope you don't have a little
[22:36] glowing piece of light in you you don't
[22:38] have a spot of eternal life in you when
[22:40] you're born of your natural birth
[22:42] there's nothing in him at all but you
[22:45] see if he was in God's thoughts when he
[22:48] come to the world he's come in God's
[22:50] thoughts at the beginning to display his
[22:52] attribute then Jesus came to break the
[22:55] clouds back so that attribute could
[22:58] display itself amen that's it he is
[23:01] God's expressed
[23:03] word and then then youve got those two
[23:06] pieces fitting together the parable of
[23:08] Matthew 13 there at the end the
[23:10] attributes being expressed when the word
[23:13] is swn down in your heart and you
[23:15] receive it not on the Wayside not in
[23:17] Stony places not cast among Thorn but
[23:20] cast on the good ground of your heart
[23:22] that was
[23:23] predestinated by God's forn knowledge to
[23:26] receive the word from before the
[23:27] foundation of the
[23:31] world so you know I got this scripture
[23:34] in here Matthew 24:24 there shall arise
[23:36] false Christ in the last days and false
[23:38] prophets and shall so show great signs
[23:41] and wonders and it'll deceive everybody
[23:43] except for the very elect so there's
[23:45] going to be somebody that will fulfill
[23:48] that scripture so right now we are
[23:51] fulfilling this and other words this is
[23:53] like a thought of God that he thought of
[23:55] before the foundation of the world and
[23:57] right now we're actually living that out
[24:00] because there's going to be somebody in
[24:01] the end times that will fulfill the
[24:03] scripture that just like all the other
[24:05] scriptures that speak of the end time
[24:07] that there's going to be somebody that
[24:08] will not be deceived so the life in you
[24:12] is the thought he had then and that
[24:14] thought has been reflected through every
[24:16] scripture the word has identified us as
[24:19] the living expression of the thought of
[24:23] God and that's why you know when when
[24:26] Jesus sent his disciples out to go
[24:28] preach and and cast out devils and and
[24:30] you know they got real excited they they
[24:32] had power to cast out devils and they
[24:34] were real happy about that and Jesus had
[24:36] to he said had to bring them back to
[24:38] reality he said now that's great that
[24:41] you're rejoicing that you have power to
[24:42] cast out Devils
[24:45] but Rejoice rather that your names are
[24:48] written in heaven Rejoice that your name
[24:51] there's that envelope that God knew he
[24:54] had your name written down before the
[24:56] foundation of the world there something
[24:58] to Rejoice
[25:00] about why is that something to Rejoice
[25:02] about that you're part of God's plan and
[25:04] purpose what what is that writing down
[25:07] your name before the foundation of the
[25:08] world that's your eternal life so when
[25:11] you hear the word that's actually
[25:12] expressing that you it's it's your new
[25:14] birth it's expressing in you that God
[25:17] you were part of God in his thoughts
[25:19] from before the foundation of the world
[25:21] and you always were part of his thoughts
[25:24] and now everything that makes up his
[25:25] thoughts and his characteristics is
[25:27] expressed in in you his nature his
[25:30] habits his thoughts it's being expressed
[25:32] in you as you hear the word now that's
[25:34] something to Rejoice about is what Jesus
[25:36] is saying you you rejoice because you
[25:38] can cast out devils and you got power
[25:41] and those kind of things but what about
[25:43] what about just be to to know that
[25:45] you're part of part of God's body part
[25:48] of his plan part of his part part of his
[25:50] eternal uh Eternal
[25:53] attributes that's why brother R when
[25:55] that and God is rich in Mercy to tell
[25:57] that little Eagle story there was
[25:58] something something in him the little
[25:59] Eagle in the barnyard seemed to be
[26:01] different from what that chicken was
[26:03] because at the beginning in the thought
[26:05] of God he was an eagle all the way back
[26:09] in the thought of God if you are a
[26:11] Christian now a genuine predestinated
[26:15] seed you was in God before there was you
[26:17] always was in God the germ of your life
[26:21] which is an attribute of God which was
[26:24] his
[26:27] thought it's the germ seed word from the
[26:30] beginning that you was in God at the
[26:32] beginning standing here drawing the seed
[26:35] life the seed is in Your Heart by for
[26:39] ordination the seed is already in there
[26:41] by the for knowledge of God
[26:43] predestinated and when it draws it can't
[26:45] draw through nothing else but the word
[26:47] he's saying in the thinking man's
[26:50] filter and invisible Union of the bride
[26:52] of Christ he said let a real
[26:53] predestinated born germ predestinated by
[26:56] God hear the word of God it's music to
[26:59] him he knows it's the truth so so let's
[27:03] really clinch it here as we close down
[27:04] what what is the gene seed of
[27:07] God it's that you are part of his word
[27:09] from the very
[27:10] beginning but then when you hear the
[27:13] word it's expressed so the gene seed of
[27:15] God is the word it's the word from both
[27:18] ends of that perspective Genesis 12627
[27:22] you are part of that spiritual man that
[27:24] was expressed in God from the before the
[27:26] foundation and when you hear the word it
[27:28] manifest that it's the word the word
[27:31] that you're hearing manifests the word
[27:34] that was back there and that's those two
[27:36] parables in Matthew 13 the attributes of
[27:39] God are expressed when you hear the word
[27:41] when the word falls into the good ground
[27:42] of your heart and I hope that uh you
[27:45] know they say teaching uh a real good
[27:47] teaching uh can clench it so good that
[27:50] you just can't get away from it so I
[27:51] hope that clenches it in that fashion
[27:54] God bless you
[27:57] [Applause]
