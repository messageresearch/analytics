[0:20] right so we could all be together right
[0:22] right
[0:24] um so that's uh that's really the
[0:28] scripture I want to read before we kind
[0:29] of get into it well let's just you know
[0:31] what there's a lot of people sick and
[0:33] and uh brother Claude had a little mini
[0:36] stroke and and that brother Wayne was
[0:38] just talking about a minute ago so um
[0:40] let's just go to the Lord in prayer real
[0:42] quick and and a personal report
[0:47] Lord Jesus we're so thankful to you God
[0:49] for your grace to us Lord in this hour
[0:51] to open your word to us Lord and I pray
[0:53] God that you'll just be with us today
[0:55] and help us to see you more and to
[0:57] understand give us a greater
[0:59] understanding of how we should approach
[1:02] this topic of communion to know more of
[1:05] you Lord and I pray God that you'll be
[1:06] with all the ones that are not here
[1:08] today Lord credit Lord that you'll give
[1:10] brother to call a special touch with you
[1:12] just to raise him up and help us the
[1:14] people out there or that um the devil's
[1:17] attacking their Pastor Lord Jesus and I
[1:19] pray God that you're touching the Lord
[1:20] Lord I pray God that you'll have give us
[1:24] a special mercy and a special Grace here
[1:26] but a way as he goes to the overseas
[1:29] this this coming Wednesday Lord Jesus
[1:31] and just be with him and bless him the
[1:32] Lord Jesus bring that Lord until bless
[1:34] the services today we pray in the name
[1:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38] amen
[1:41] so
[1:44] now the topic we've kind of been on with
[1:46] we've kind of run down through uh a lot
[1:49] of different scriptures and a lot of
[1:50] different things and and communion I
[1:53] believe is is it maybe it might seem uh
[1:58] parts of it deep and and uh but you know
[2:03] when God begins to reveal it it really
[2:05] becomes real simple right that's what I
[2:07] want to stress is that a lot of these
[2:09] things are are really so simple that you
[2:12] almost can Overlook uh it it should be
[2:16] it's something that's attainable it's
[2:19] something that God can reveal to us it's
[2:21] something that um
[2:22] is God bringing us closer to him and
[2:25] close fellowship with him and and that's
[2:28] what Ephesians chapter 5 is speaking of
[2:30] that the relationship between God and
[2:33] his church is one where
[2:36] what God's trying to do is he that that
[2:40] stone that came out of the mountain he's
[2:42] trying to build us up into into the
[2:45] privilege of that mountain it's the
[2:46] whole church into the reflection of of
[2:50] the mountains Jesus Jesus himself when
[2:53] he he the Bible says that he will he was
[2:55] in the express image of the father all
[2:58] right
[2:58] hey no nobody could know what God was
[3:01] like unless they looked at the sun to
[3:05] see what the father was like and what he
[3:07] looked like what what his attributes
[3:09] were and now God is putting himself in
[3:11] the into the into his people
[3:14] to make manifest to show the world Amen
[3:18] the image of the of the Unseen God
[3:23] now communion is is really is drawing
[3:27] nine to the uh under God and and and the
[3:30] Bible says uh
[3:32] you know in James chapter 4 verse 8 draw
[3:36] all night of God and He will draw nine
[3:38] of you that's right cleanse your hands
[3:40] you Sinners and purify your heart she
[3:42] double-minded because Jesus said if my
[3:46] hobby lifted up I'll draw all men to me
[3:48] and that's his purpose is to draw people
[3:50] to him and that's I I got to think well
[3:52] you know what makes a good sermon you
[3:55] know you can read a lot of these uh
[3:57] chapters and things right after this
[3:59] Paul starts talking about children obey
[4:01] your parents in the Lord and and a lot
[4:04] of times we get so critical of Minister
[4:06] that seems like they're they're bringing
[4:08] a real basic sermon but it's real the
[4:11] gospel is really is really simple
[4:14] and in any you know I believe that any
[4:17] Minister that's trying to um
[4:19] bring Point people to Christ right that
[4:22] that's really uh A good sermon a lot of
[4:27] times we you know my motive is not to
[4:29] preach something that's so far above the
[4:31] people that actually you know you can't
[4:33] hardly grasp it but just kind of to
[4:35] bring it down low and and um
[4:38] and and point everyone to God that's it
[4:43] now
[4:45] because communion is not it's not just a
[4:49] it's not just a
[4:52] you know when you when you speak about
[4:54] communion you you think of of joining
[4:57] two things together even that that story
[4:59] that that that uh was told that you just
[5:02] told in Luke chapter 16 verse 26 that of
[5:06] of the um the Rich Young Ruler and the
[5:09] uh
[5:11] Lazarus had died and when he went into
[5:13] Paradise he said between us the the rich
[5:16] man looked across he said there's a goal
[5:19] fixed between us okay there's a a great
[5:21] Gulf and what what God is trying to do
[5:24] is remove the middle wall of partition
[5:26] between us to bring us together and
[5:29] anytime you speak of communion you're
[5:31] really talking about joining two things
[5:32] you're talking about joining Christ in
[5:34] his church right spirit and Truth
[5:37] even our natural birth is really came
[5:40] about because of a communion between our
[5:42] parents and and and that's why Jesus
[5:45] said in John chapter 4 right after he
[5:47] got done when he was talking to the
[5:49] woman at the well right after he got
[5:50] done talking in John chapter three uh
[5:53] speaks about Nicodemus and and he was
[5:55] telling about the new birth and John
[5:57] chapter 4 he said that the hour is
[5:59] coming and now he is when the true
[6:02] worship will worship in spirit amen and
[6:04] truth and now all down through the Old
[6:08] Testament they they had the truth of the
[6:11] letter of the law right they had the
[6:13] truth and the builders that were
[6:15] supposed to be building the body of the
[6:17] of the church rejected the spirit of the
[6:20] real truth when it came right they they
[6:23] rejected that Cornerstone but so they
[6:25] had the the written word all down
[6:28] Through the Ages but now when when the
[6:31] spirit and Truth was going to come and
[6:33] be joined together they they turned it
[6:35] down right on the day of Pentecost the
[6:38] uh the Spirit came and quickened that
[6:40] truth that they had heard for three and
[6:42] a half years that's right and it was
[6:44] joined together and that that was real
[6:47] community
[6:48] now
[6:50] I I got I got to look at it uh it's
[6:54] amazing how all these different stories
[6:56] just just tie together now think about
[6:58] this the the statue of perfect man is
[7:01] building going up a ladder and in the
[7:03] Old Testament you remember that story
[7:05] that we were looking at Jacob that laid
[7:07] his head on a stone and he saw a ladder
[7:10] where the Angels were ascending and
[7:11] descending right now
[7:13] the Jews believe that that stone they
[7:16] they actually know where that stone was
[7:19] and and that's in at the Dome of the
[7:22] Rock where they they call it the
[7:23] foundation stone right and there's a uh
[7:26] an actual rock and it has uh over the
[7:29] years man has has flattened out pieces
[7:31] and whatnot and there's a flat now part
[7:33] portion of where the holy of holies
[7:36] in the same dimensions of the Ark of the
[7:39] Covenant
[7:40] and they believe that that's where the
[7:42] the holy of holies was actually on top
[7:44] of that foundation stone and that's the
[7:46] place where Jacob laid his hand because
[7:48] he said he put his hand on a rock on the
[7:51] stones right and and went to sleep and
[7:53] that and they call that the foundation
[7:55] stone now that's the the same way that
[7:58] the the temple was built upon that
[8:00] foundation stone that's the same way
[8:02] that the church is built upon the
[8:04] foundation of that that stone that came
[8:07] out of the mountain that stone that came
[8:09] out of the mountain is what you're built
[8:11] on where the whole church is built on
[8:12] and we got we were talking about and
[8:15] then it was rejected by the builders we
[8:17] were talking about this way on the way
[8:19] to church is it what think about how
[8:20] that stone fell when he was in The
[8:23] Garden of Gethsemane as as he right that
[8:27] he was about to go through with with the
[8:29] most difficult yeah you know I get
[8:31] nervous when I'm going to go on a job
[8:33] interview or things like that but but
[8:35] this was uh he knew what was going to
[8:38] happen he knew the the sacrifice that he
[8:42] was going to have to make
[8:43] that he was going to be
[8:45] stripped naked and put up on the cross
[8:48] and so the whole world could see him but
[8:51] that is the stone the foundation that
[8:53] the whole church is built upon the price
[8:55] that he paid for them
[8:57] I I just want to stress how how simple
[9:00] it is because it this this little man
[9:04] that that uh no man would desire and the
[9:07] Bible says he had no Beauty up on that
[9:10] cross dying and such a great profound
[9:16] thing in the whole world overlooked it
[9:18] and and that's what God is he's doing
[9:20] something today that thing was so simple
[9:23] from the outside that the whole world
[9:24] were overlooking that's right the world
[9:26] the world can't understand it and
[9:28] remember that what scripture we're
[9:30] reading Jeremiah 50 verse 2 that that
[9:33] Baal is confounded it confounds the the
[9:37] minds of the wives Improvement you can't
[9:40] understand it but the simple and
[9:42] long-learned
[9:50] the simple and unlearned are the ones
[9:52] that get it that's right and now let's
[9:54] see I want to read in Hebrews chapter 2.
[10:09] let's start at verse seven
[10:11] foreign
[10:18] oh yeah
[10:20] I thought I'd change it up a little bit
[10:22] today I think sometimes uh everybody
[10:23] gets a little bit tired looking at the
[10:25] slides or whatever so we'll do a little
[10:27] different I don't yeah
[10:32] we'll we'll make you flip the scripture
[10:35] make it work a little bit for yourself
[10:40] so Hebrews chapter 2 verse 7 says Thou
[10:43] mayest Tim a little lower than the
[10:45] angels that crowns him with glory and
[10:47] honor and it set him over the works of
[10:49] thy hands
[10:52] see because God starts his building in
[10:55] humility he took not like that that that
[10:57] building that the devil made starting at
[11:01] the head it was a head of gold trying to
[11:03] be all uh look at me uh right starting
[11:05] because yeah Power without character is
[11:09] satanic so the devil starts at the head
[11:12] and God starts a defeat in humility and
[11:16] begins building himself up
[11:18] so he he came down from glory and
[11:21] remember what we were just reading in
[11:22] Ephesians chapter five he left it all
[11:25] like a man that leaves father and mother
[11:28] and Cleaves to his wife amen now now you
[11:32] know a lot of times we're making we'll
[11:34] kind of make the excuse to try to well
[11:36] uh you know
[11:39] I'm not going to talk about that
[11:42] I feel a little bit sick not to say that
[11:45] so
[11:47] Dow has put all things verse eight thou
[11:49] has put all things in subjection under
[11:52] his feet
[11:53] everything's under his feet all power
[11:55] and Heaven and Earth is given under me
[11:58] he said
[11:59] everything
[12:02] for in that he put all in subjection
[12:05] under him he left nothing that is not
[12:08] put under him but now we see not yet all
[12:11] things but under him we don't we don't
[12:13] see it yet because look at this place
[12:17] it's still got you know you get sick
[12:21] exactly getting older it's getting skin
[12:23] spots right it's getting uh
[12:26] problems in life
[12:30] exactly and so so he put He in that
[12:35] scripture we read last Sunday it is
[12:38] finished when he was up there on that
[12:39] cross and out of his side came the blood
[12:42] in the water and he cried it is finished
[12:44] and gave up his Spirit it was finished
[12:46] right there all right but the mechanism
[12:48] by which it would be complete came out
[12:51] of him the water and the blood and the
[12:53] spirit his bride came out of his side
[12:55] the mechanism by which we could enter
[12:57] back into him enter back in the
[12:59] community with him
[13:01] came out and it was manifested that rock
[13:03] came into the people uh on the day of
[13:06] Pentecost into the Believers and that
[13:08] word that they had heard for three and a
[13:09] half years was quickened so now let's go
[13:12] to uh
[13:13] First Corinthians chapter 15.
[13:27] verse 24.
[13:34] First Corinthians 15.
[13:37] but I will start at verse 20.
[13:40] but now is Christ the Risen from the
[13:42] dead and become the first fruits of them
[13:44] that slip for Since By Man Came Death by
[13:46] man came also the resurrection of the
[13:48] Dead
[13:49] for as in Adam all die even so in Christ
[13:52] shall all be made alive
[13:54] but every man in his own order crossed
[13:57] the first fruits afterward they that are
[13:59] act they are that are Christ that is
[14:01] coming
[14:02] then come at the end when he shall have
[14:04] delivered up the kingdom to God even the
[14:07] father when he shall I put down all Rule
[14:09] and all authority and all power and all
[14:12] authority and power now there's what
[14:14] we're talking about when we're talking
[14:15] about that stone that came out of the
[14:16] mountain and destroyed everything
[14:18] Babylon is not just a city but it's the
[14:22] work of the devil in your flesh because
[14:24] he mingled with his he mingled his seed
[14:28] with God see and he don't have a seed
[14:31] he's just messing around with it he's
[14:32] putting his own with ideas and own
[14:34] thoughts in the into God's word right
[14:35] and and that's what God is doing by the
[14:37] New Birth by communion with him putting
[14:41] down all rules and all authority and
[14:43] power for he must Reign he must have
[14:45] preeminence until he hath put all
[14:48] enemies under his feet The Last Enemy
[14:51] that shall be destroyed right before he
[14:54] has put all things under his feet but
[14:55] when he saith all things are put under
[14:57] him it doesn't manifest that he is
[14:59] accepted which did put all things under
[15:01] him and when all things shall be subdued
[15:04] unto him then shall the son also himself
[15:07] be subject unto him that put all things
[15:10] under him
[15:11] that God may be all in all now if you're
[15:14] having trouble understanding what that
[15:16] scripture is talking about just imagine
[15:17] in your mind that stone coming rolling
[15:19] down through the seven churches and and
[15:22] off down to the seven churches that that
[15:24] uh that uh uh that cushion Nimrod system
[15:28] was in trying to get in amongst the
[15:32] people and God is tearing that thing
[15:34] down
[15:35] Martin Luther comes out and he says now
[15:38] I know something that that maybe was
[15:41] good from the people a few hundred years
[15:43] ago that that just shall live by faith
[15:45] and that Stone's coming rolling through
[15:48] yes tearing it down I I we're listening
[15:51] to that song that they sing that it says
[15:52] the stone came from Battle Heaven that
[15:54] stone didn't come from Babylon it came
[15:57] from the Mountain of God but pay
[15:59] attention to the words and songs a lot
[16:00] now because it didn't come from Babylon
[16:02] it came rolling through and destroyed
[16:05] backwards extra Martin Luther and John
[16:08] Wesley and higher and higher until the
[16:10] war bird is standing there and can be
[16:13] anointed so that God has preeminence
[16:16] just like on the on the Jordan River
[16:17] that now now the Jordan River
[16:24] real quick
[16:34] the Jordan River
[16:37] is is the big problem today in the in
[16:39] the uh
[16:41] it was a problem back then with John and
[16:44] his problem now in people's minds right
[16:47] that's right because brother Reynolds
[16:49] said the Jordan River is is your is is
[16:52] it represents separation it represents
[16:54] uh uh when you come to the the Jordan
[16:57] River of your life is the deciding Point
[17:00] whether you're going to stay with the
[17:01] things of the world or were you going to
[17:02] cross over and be separated right but
[17:04] remember Elijah and Elijah when they
[17:06] came to the river the River Jordan and
[17:08] Elijah said I'm not going anywhere but
[17:11] I'm going to stay right with you right
[17:13] through thick or thin and that
[17:15] represents the church and Christ staying
[17:19] right with him and Elijah went up and
[17:21] and that anointing came back on the
[17:24] church to do greater work
[17:26] a double portion the anointing that was
[17:30] on Elijah now can come back and and go
[17:34] all around the world right just one
[17:35] person then all around the world that's
[17:37] right that little Stone grew into a
[17:40] great Mountain you see so John chapter
[17:43] first John chapter 5 verse one whosoever
[17:46] believeth that Jesus Christ is born of
[17:49] God and everyone that loveth him that
[17:51] begat loveth him also that is begotten
[17:53] of him by this we know that we love the
[17:56] children of God when we love God and
[17:58] keep his Commandments for this is the
[18:00] love of God that we keep his
[18:01] Commandments and his Commandments that's
[18:04] right for whatsoever is born of God
[18:07] overcometh the world now there's that
[18:09] stone coming out of the mountain and
[18:10] destroying destroying the things of the
[18:13] world in your life you know you can look
[18:15] at that stone coming out of the mountain
[18:17] and and destroying uh during the the uh
[18:22] tribulation and destroying all the the
[18:24] Russia comes out and shoots this errors
[18:27] into Babylon or anything but I won't
[18:28] focus on our lives right now because
[18:30] that's uh
[18:34] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[18:38] the world and this is the victory that
[18:41] overcometh the world even our faith
[18:44] faith is the it starts in faith that's
[18:47] the rock that's the foundation stone who
[18:50] is he that overcometh the world but he
[18:52] that believeth Jesus is the son of God
[18:55] this is he that came by water and blood
[18:59] now look how he wears this
[19:02] this is he that came by water and blood
[19:05] even Jesus Christ
[19:07] not by water only but by water and blood
[19:11] and it is the spirit that birth
[19:13] witnessed because the spirit is true
[19:15] right now Irene has said this about
[19:17] surrendous because see he's dealing with
[19:19] the same thing that's being dealt with
[19:20] today was Jesus God and flesh was Jesus
[19:25] God it is very important to understand
[19:27] what that was because on the River
[19:29] Jordan the the Dove came down upon the
[19:33] lamb which is the same thing as
[19:36] happening today when you get to adoption
[19:38] the lamb is the god in the in his church
[19:41] and we're led by the dove the dove comes
[19:45] down and told the word when you're when
[19:48] when the word you're built up into the
[19:50] image of your maker then that that
[19:52] Capstone can come down and have
[19:54] preeminence on your life and leave the
[19:56] church amen so he had to be the word for
[20:00] that Dove to come down upon him and lead
[20:02] him into the ministry that he was
[20:03] ordained to be right so Irene says this
[20:06] about serenthus who back back there had
[20:08] that the same the same concept that on
[20:11] the at the River Jordan he was not God
[20:13] he was just he came by natural means he
[20:17] came by his mother and father and then
[20:19] then the Dove came on and made him God
[20:21] and listen to what every hand says
[20:23] sirens again a man who was educated in
[20:26] the wisdom of the Egyptians taught that
[20:29] the world was not made by the primary
[20:31] God but by a certain power far separated
[20:34] from him
[20:35] a separate person yeah and at a distance
[20:39] from that principality who was Supreme
[20:41] Over the universe and ignorant of him
[20:44] who is above all he represented Jesus as
[20:48] having not been born of aversion but as
[20:50] being the son of Joseph and Mary
[20:52] according to the ordinary course of
[20:55] human generation
[20:56] while he nevertheless was more righteous
[20:59] prudent and wise than other men
[21:03] moreover after his baptism Christ
[21:07] descended upon him in the form of a dove
[21:09] from the supreme ruler and that then he
[21:12] proclaimed the unknown father and
[21:14] performed Miracles but at last Christ
[21:16] departed from Jesus
[21:19] and that then Jesus suffered and rose
[21:21] again while Christ remained impassable
[21:24] inasmuch as he was a spiritual being so
[21:27] in other words he was not God at the
[21:30] River Jordan and he was not God when he
[21:33] died that's the same thing that's being
[21:36] preached today right and that's the same
[21:38] thing that you know John had a harsh
[21:41] words to say about that if you can't say
[21:43] that Jesus was God when he paid the
[21:45] price that he was God from the beginning
[21:47] to the end right because Hebrews 13 8
[21:50] says he's the same yesterday today and
[21:52] forever then what what is your face
[21:54] faith based on
[21:57] so so look at first you John 5 1 he says
[22:00] this is he that came by water and blood
[22:04] and in John chapter 3 he tells Nick and
[22:06] English you must be born of water and
[22:08] spirit the washing of the water of the
[22:10] word the water represents deity he was
[22:13] not just he didn't just come by by uh by
[22:17] natural means and and he he was a
[22:21] emerging a communion of Heaven and Earth
[22:24] God in flesh so that's what he's saying
[22:27] not by water only but by water and blood
[22:30] it is the spirit that beareth witness
[22:33] because the spirit is truth and then he
[22:36] gets under that scripture that we're all
[22:37] familiar with therefore there are three
[22:39] that bear record in heaven the Father
[22:40] the word and the Holy Ghost and these
[22:43] three are one
[22:45] and that was manifested right there on
[22:47] the repertoire and it that's that scene
[22:50] is so you know you've got a voice from
[22:53] Heaven a dove coming down on a lamb and
[22:56] it seems like without Revelation that
[22:58] there's three different people there but
[23:00] by revelation we know that God is one
[23:02] right and there are three that bear
[23:05] witness in Earth a spirit and the water
[23:07] and the blood and these three agree in
[23:09] one and they agreed to put you back
[23:11] inside of that one so that's that's that
[23:14] that the mechanism by which God puts
[23:17] that stone in you to start to start
[23:18] tearing down Babylon to bring you in
[23:21] communion now now look at that word
[23:22] communion communion has the word Union
[23:24] in it because communion is uniting you
[23:28] if you have communion with you between
[23:30] the husband and wife
[23:32] then that Ephesians chapter five just
[23:35] like Adam in the beginning the bone of
[23:38] My Flesh bone my bone flesh in my flesh
[23:40] that's how you know brother I'm told
[23:42] that he talked about his wife like he
[23:44] said I wish that I could just pull her
[23:45] inside that's right because they they
[23:48] had such love for one another but you
[23:50] know really he was talking about Christ
[23:53] in the church because that's how that's
[23:55] what God wants to do to us he wants to
[23:57] take that little piece of the ocean that
[23:59] he's that little drop spoonful of ocean
[24:01] that he's putting us and bring it back
[24:04] into himself that he might be all in all
[24:09] that's right
[24:11] that's right now
[24:17] so communion where uh and we're we're
[24:21] running out of time a little bit but now
[24:24] so you can see how every Community
[24:27] communion is is is uniting it's it's the
[24:31] coming of the Lord to you and and see on
[24:34] on that day of Pentecost that stone came
[24:38] rolling into the hearts of all of the
[24:40] beliefs and to fulfill that promise that
[24:43] Jesus gave them he said I will not leave
[24:46] you comfortless am I I will come to you
[24:48] okay now see that just to clarify a
[24:52] little bit it seems like that that uh
[24:54] when he was there on the River Jordan
[24:58] many have the idea that that the Dove
[25:02] and lamb were two different things
[25:05] is it is it the same person is it the
[25:09] same person that fills you with the Holy
[25:11] Ghost and then caps you off right is it
[25:13] or is it something different it's the
[25:16] same person right it's this exact same
[25:19] person right that that fills you with
[25:21] the Holy Ghost and gets you to play a
[25:23] place where he can have preeminence and
[25:25] then cast you off so that he can lead
[25:26] you now look when when when when when
[25:29] that anointing came on Jesus at the
[25:32] River Jordan
[25:33] there was nothing in the world could
[25:36] stand in his way
[25:37] when that anointing Came Upon David when
[25:41] when uh when he was anointed to be king
[25:43] there wasn't nothing in the world no
[25:46] Goliath everything came before Goliath
[25:48] and said I don't I don't care yeah I I'm
[25:51] gonna
[25:52] you know I don't have nothing but five
[25:54] little stones and and a little a little
[25:57] Rinky Dink slingshot and you got uh
[25:59] armor Bearer and people to help you and
[26:01] everything but it doesn't matter amen
[26:03] and that's the same way the church will
[26:05] be is when that anointing comes down
[26:09] their death
[26:11] we'll have will be conquered and
[26:14] remember it death on the cross he said
[26:17] it is finished death was finished it was
[26:20] conquered but yet God that stone had to
[26:22] come rolling down through seven churches
[26:24] kept come rolling down through your life
[26:26] amen and destroyed
[26:29] death
[26:33] and that's why in First Corinthians 15
[26:35] 24 the income of the end when he shall
[26:37] have delivered up the kingdom of God
[26:39] even the father on each shall I put down
[26:41] all rules and all are already in power
[26:45] foreign
[26:51] well I had a few of I had a lot of other
[26:54] things but I think that'll be a good
[26:56] stopping point but um
[27:00] this uh while Brooke Wade's gone
[27:03] um we're gonna uh look brother Ryan's
[27:07] going to take the next Sunday school
[27:08] lesson and then uh
[27:10] brother Joe
[27:11] and then brother Louise brother Luis is
[27:13] doing the children's the older kids
[27:15] Sunday school lesson this morning so
[27:17] we'll we'll just uh have a a little
[27:20] brief period of respite until brother
[27:22] Wade gets back and then he'll hit the
[27:24] ground running
[27:25] so God bless you all
[27:29] have some of the Run may be gone but
