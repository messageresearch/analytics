[16:23] on that we are Al that we're thinking
[16:26] about and talking to people about so
[16:28] let's look in our Bibles to the Book of
[16:31] Revelations we have kind of shifted the
[16:33] gear a little bit and uh and I want you
[16:36] to
[16:37] uh bear with us today we're going to
[16:41] we're going to start on a new
[16:43] dispensation now what are we in the
[16:46] dispensation of today we're in the
[16:48] dispensation of the son of man we know
[16:50] that right all right so we that is our
[16:53] unique that is our call is to have Jesus
[16:59] Christ back on Earth again in his
[17:02] bride in its
[17:04] fullness he's been down through the ages
[17:07] in in part all right and we'll talk
[17:09] about tonight or this afternoon the
[17:12] Alpha and Omega has got to be the same
[17:14] and we'll look at that but remember
[17:16] please continue to read your your um uh
[17:20] Church age book we'll get into the
[17:22] Ephesian Church age here pretty quick
[17:24] but today I want to talk about a new
[17:25] dispensation
[17:27] because we are in this dispensation
[17:30] because of what because we're the last
[17:32] Church age all right everybody with
[17:34] we're the last Church age there's no
[17:35] more all right Paul was the first one
[17:38] first dip of oil all right God poured it
[17:40] in give them the Holy Ghost on the day
[17:42] of Pentecost we've had a day of
[17:44] Pentecost over here but then we have a
[17:46] message that's going to take us onto the
[17:47] coming of the Lord all right cuz seven
[17:49] is completion all right so that's why we
[17:52] are here on this side that's why we had
[17:55] to have a Prophet come to tell us how to
[17:57] live how to dress how to do all these
[17:58] different things he didn't tell us how
[17:59] to do these things it was already in the
[18:01] Bible and we'll see in the book of even
[18:04] with the Ephesians God starts out first
[18:06] thing he said you've lost your first
[18:08] love you've lost water baptism name of
[18:10] the Lord Jesus Christ you've lost you
[18:12] know trinitarian Doctrine in the first
[18:14] church age well now there's no
[18:15] trinitarian Doctrine in our age for us
[18:17] the bride age for us all right so let's
[18:20] read this and let's talk about a new
[18:22] dispensation because you know what all
[18:23] that was new when John John the Baptist
[18:26] stood on the on the shores and he said
[18:27] behold the Lamb of God it takes away the
[18:29] sin of the world well here you got your
[18:31] Pharisees and Sadducees standing over
[18:32] here
[18:33] going we got a lamb over here it's a
[18:37] real lamb Moses told us Moses told us to
[18:40] take this lamb and and slay it and
[18:44] and that's a
[18:46] human who are you well there was a new
[18:49] dispensation com in all right and you
[18:51] got to be able to see that right
[18:54] Revelations 1:10 says I was in the
[18:55] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[18:57] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[19:00] saying I am Alpha and Omega like I said
[19:03] we'll get those those two letters the
[19:05] first letter of the Greek alphabet and
[19:06] the last letter of the Greek alphabet
[19:08] Alpha and Omega all right the first and
[19:10] the last what thou seest write in a book
[19:13] and send it into the seven churches
[19:14] which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna
[19:17] pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and
[19:21] leosa and I turned to see the voice that
[19:23] spake with me and being turned I saw
[19:24] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[19:27] midst of the seven cand Stat one liken
[19:29] to the son of man clothed with a garment
[19:31] down to the foot and gir about the PS
[19:33] with a golden girdle in other words he
[19:35] was dressed the way he wanted to show
[19:38] John he wanted to show John this
[19:42] person John had met the son of man John
[19:44] was laid on the son of man's bosom the
[19:47] real Jesus when he was here on Earth
[19:50] right but now he sees him in a different
[19:53] form his head and his hair were white
[19:55] like wool white as snow his eyes were
[19:57] flame of fire his feet like fine brass
[19:59] as they burned in the furnace and his
[20:00] voice as a sound of many Waters and
[20:03] we'll get into we'll break that down
[20:04] just for a minute since one maybe not
[20:06] here last Sunday two Sundays ago and he
[20:09] had in his right hand Seven Stars and
[20:11] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[20:12] sword and his countenance was as the sun
[20:15] shineth in his strength you may be
[20:17] seated thank God he's the one that had
[20:19] us in his hand he didn't give it to
[20:22] somebody else he didn't give it to a
[20:23] pope he didn't give it to a priest hello
[20:25] somebody he gave it to the Bride of
[20:27] Jesus Christ
[20:28] and he gave us a five-fold Ministry to
[20:31] perfect the Saints so the only way
[20:32] you're going to be perfected is by a
[20:34] five-fold Ministry all right and he gave
[20:37] that in the first church age second
[20:39] Church age all the way up but there was
[20:42] no perfection in those ages until this
[20:44] age all right so that's where we're
[20:47] sitting today and the Bible tells us he
[20:49] was in the midst or the middle or
[20:51] amongst and we we found the picture here
[20:54] that's pretty much accurate except that
[20:56] those candles are separate which they
[20:58] should be together and we'll look at
[21:00] that in just a minute we'll pull up a
[21:02] chart some of you if you don't have U if
[21:05] you don't have one of these you need to
[21:06] get one and kind of lay it by your side
[21:08] or keep it in your Bible cuz we're going
[21:10] to reference this there's several up
[21:11] here if you need one but I'm going to
[21:13] try to pull it up on the
[21:16] screen so what we're looking at now is
[21:18] we were talking about a prism what is a
[21:20] prism now a prism is one
[21:23] item all right a prism is one it's a
[21:25] piece of glass and it and can't be in a
[21:29] any other form it can't be round to
[21:31] produce these numbers
[21:33] right something fail wind blowing
[21:36] something fell on the
[21:37] uh there's about 80,000
[21:41] um peons out there in that in that on
[21:45] that one tree and they keep falling oh
[21:48] by the way me and Jun picked up about 10
[21:50] five gallon buckets of of um of peans
[21:54] yesterday and there's more so if you
[21:57] want some tough I already asked you one
[21:59] time you're not getting

[22:05] the other day and we were talking about
[22:06] something and I said hey man I said if
[22:08] you need anything call somebody
[22:11] else so I took my little peon picker and
[22:15] I picked them up yesterday and we we
[22:17] still got probably three or four buckets
[22:19] left so if you want
[22:22] some go to the store and buy
[22:26] them it's kind of like the it's kind of
[22:28] like the hen Story the little you know
[22:30] you come come and help me do this but
[22:32] all when they're sheld and inside of a
[22:34] plastic bag right mom everybody wants
[22:37] them yeah I'll take them but shell them
[22:41] yourself but no you can help some I'm
[22:43] just kidding you we can we'll bring some
[22:45] not shelled shell them
[22:49] yourself but there's a lot of them Lord
[22:51] blessed us with like marbles out in the
[22:54] yard so uh we got out there and picked
[22:57] them up but just just uh if you want
[22:59] some we'll bring you some we always like
[23:00] to share we don't you know I don't we
[23:02] don't keep stuff to oursel we try to
[23:03] share it for you share it with you uh
[23:05] there's no more deer meat left so can't
[23:08] I've already shared enough of that so uh
[23:10] we'll wait till next season to see what
[23:12] the Lord will do to give us another one
[23:14] in case we um if we make it till this
[23:17] time next year amen I hope the Lord
[23:21] comes so when we're looking at this this
[23:24] piece of equipment it's called a prism
[23:28] and it's a three-sided we we put we'll
[23:30] put the picture up in a minute so what
[23:32] he's doing he's standing in the midst of
[23:34] the seven golden candlesticks both arms
[23:36] out in the shape of a
[23:39] cross saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[23:42] beginning and the end he's everything in
[23:44] between but he had to start
[23:46] somewhere and he had to end somewhere
[23:49] cuz a gentile dispensation started on
[23:51] the day of Pentecost and it will end
[23:53] when we take a body change and leave out
[23:55] of here then he'll go to the Jews is
[23:57] everybody with me all right so it is
[23:59] important to have the book ends right
[24:02] all right if you don't have book ends
[24:04] what happens if you don't have book ends
[24:05] the books just fall everywhere you got
[24:07] to have two book ends and we'll see that
[24:09] this afternoon but that prism he's
[24:11] standing and he is what he is the
[24:14] light Christ is the light he's the light
[24:16] of the church he's the light of the
[24:17] world he said he was all right and I
[24:19] believe he is only light there is if
[24:21] there is not light of God there's
[24:23] darkness and that's it there's no one
[24:25] between so when a light passes through a
[24:28] which has got to be a white light praise
[24:30] God got to be a white light it's bent or
[24:34] refracted into seven different colors
[24:37] all right is everybody with me on that
[24:39] it's the same light you haven't changed
[24:41] the
[24:43] light you've just shown the color that
[24:46] was already in the light all right cuz
[24:49] you can't add two can't take away those
[24:51] seven colors were in Christ when he
[24:53] walked on the shore of Galilee we all
[24:55] were in him the whole bride the whole
[24:57] Gentile bride was inside of that man by
[24:59] the Holy Ghost all
[25:01] right so so that light is bent now
[25:05] remember look this light's not broke I
[25:08] was thinking about this yesterday it's
[25:09] not a broken light man has broke the
[25:12] light and put all these different
[25:13] doctrines in to make it look a different
[25:16] color and you don't bend the word of God
[25:18] to say you bend it you take that same
[25:20] word of God and you bring it as an
[25:23] Ephesian Church age as a sardian church
[25:26] age per it's been just a little bit
[25:28] there's a little bit light here more
[25:30] than there is over here there's a little
[25:31] bit more over here and each wavelength
[25:33] is refracted or bent by a slightly
[25:37] different let me put it this way Church
[25:39] age right and characteristics of that
[25:43] church age every Church age had a
[25:45] characteristic all right and it's real
[25:47] strange sister Barbara's not here today
[25:49] but she gave me a a thing that all the
[25:52] constellations if you take seven
[25:54] constellations and take the seven Church
[25:55] ages that are in Asia don't you think
[25:57] think God knows what he's doing if you
[25:59] lay them right over the top of each
[26:00] other every one of those cities are
[26:01] right in the
[26:02] constellation of the
[26:05] heaven God's perfect sometimes we go oh
[26:08] man he's perfect he does it right the
[26:11] first time he put those cities in there
[26:13] put the people in there with the
[26:14] characteristics just so we can stand
[26:16] here today and look back into history
[26:17] and say that's exactly what they were so
[26:20] upon Passage through the prism the white
[26:22] light is separated into its component
[26:25] colors now one light seven refracted
[26:28] into seven different colors which is the
[26:31] seven Church ages look which is the
[26:33] Seven Stars the seven Messengers they
[26:36] had seven different messages cuz
[26:39] Luther's message today will not even get
[26:41] you in the body of Christ it is
[26:44] justification but during that time God
[26:46] winked at that refraction of light and
[26:49] said that's my man then Wesley that's my
[26:52] man then Luther Wesley all different one
[26:55] that's my man that's my different color
[26:57] that I'm going to use during that
[27:00] dispensation all right everybody with me
[27:02] on that and there are all the colors we
[27:03] won't go through them but that's what it
[27:05] looks like right there and any way you
[27:07] take that triangle and you can move it
[27:09] any way you want to you'll still get
[27:11] those that light can't do it with a
[27:13] circle can't do it with any other shape
[27:15] except that you put the white light in
[27:17] and then it refracts into seven
[27:20] different colors of light but one light
[27:24] one
[27:25] God one Faith one Lord one baptism
[27:28] listen Luther preached Jesus
[27:31] Christ Wesley preached Jesus Christ
[27:34] Columba preached Jesus Christ why that
[27:35] was the theme of the age was Jesus
[27:38] Christ he was in every person in the
[27:40] Holy Ghost they got the same Holy Ghost
[27:41] you and I did it's just our refraction
[27:44] of light which comes to what your
[27:46] eyes right how do you pick up light to
[27:49] your eyes if you're blind you can't see
[27:50] it so you pick up and there either um
[27:54] one of them was talking about the your
[27:56] eyes is is into your soul you know
[27:59] that's that's it's a Gateway you open
[28:00] your eyes and you see things that you
[28:02] can't forget sometimes we wish we
[28:05] did so the seven characteristics and we
[28:08] were talking about this a couple of
[28:09] Sunday ago the seven characteristics
[28:11] number one is his head and his hair with
[28:13] white like wool as white as snow now I
[28:15] want you to understand something we'll
[28:16] read this in just a little bit it looks
[28:19] like all these seven is nothing but just
[28:20] God bringing judgment down on the on the
[28:23] earth well he is a temporary judgment
[28:25] we'll read where brother R talks about a
[28:26] temporary Jud judgement on the earth cuz
[28:29] how's that how's that uh Ephesian Church
[28:31] age going to be judged it's going to be
[28:34] judged by what Paul
[28:36] said and his followers that's how
[28:39] they're going to be judged they're going
[28:40] to come up to the white Throne judgment
[28:41] they're going to say did you accept Paul
[28:43] that's why brother brandham we'll read
[28:44] it this afternoon where brother brandham
[28:46] the Omega bride he comes up and he says
[28:48] hey did Paul did did Paul preach this
[28:51] and this this he said yeah he said so
[28:53] did I and he said those millions of
[28:55] people were going and were resting on
[28:57] that what you and I can't take a
[29:00] trinitarian Doctrine
[29:03] anymore you and I can't form a water
[29:06] baptism in name Father Son and Holy
[29:08] Ghost why we've been called out of that
[29:09] age into another age called The Bride
[29:13] age but we're still stuck in Le OFA you
[29:15] drove you $50,000 Le out ofan card to
[29:18] church today well Donnie probably didn't
[29:20] he's probably two $3,000
[29:23] but all
[29:26] right we all got here in a car all right
[29:30] Le osia at work all right his head and
[29:33] his hair were white like wool it's white
[29:34] as snow but every one of these we see
[29:36] that it's judgment but what he has to do
[29:39] is he has to first come and present his
[29:41] message and we'll get into this in in a
[29:43] minute he presents his message and when
[29:45] he presents his message through a
[29:47] messenger all right the people are
[29:50] judged by that so his hair is white as
[29:52] wool white bright as snow I'm just going
[29:54] to kind of skip through this real quick
[29:57] time means little to God now remember he
[30:00] didn't have he didn't have gray
[30:03] hair he had a
[30:05] wig like they do in the old if you watch
[30:07] an old movie or you go over to Britain
[30:09] and they have their court and all that
[30:10] stuff you got one guy sometimes you got
[30:13] two three guys and they got the white
[30:14] wig on well that shows Authority or
[30:17] wisdom as we see here the brilliant
[30:20] white hair does not signify age but
[30:22] experience maturity and wisdom and
[30:26] that's what we're looking at the a
[30:27] perfect man we should have that white
[30:32] wig P Vision brother R said that
[30:35] signified his complete
[30:37] Authority now who has complete Authority
[30:39] we come to the white Throne judgment
[30:41] who's going to have complete authority
[30:42] Jesus Christ yes but there are other
[30:46] Thrones in the Book of Revelations which
[30:48] is me and you he has what he has
[30:51] transferred that judgment to his
[30:55] bride right right he signifies his
[30:58] complete Authority head head to foot
[31:00] robe to meet out Justice 1 Corinthians 6
[31:04] verse1 says dare any of you having a
[31:06] matter against another go to court or
[31:08] law before the unjust and not before the
[31:10] Saints why you doing that all right do
[31:12] you not know that the Saints shall judge
[31:14] the world
[31:16] world and if the world shall be judged
[31:18] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[31:22] smallest matters that's why a lot of
[31:24] things can be settled right here in
[31:26] church and it doesn't have to go to
[31:27] court now as I said before if you go out
[31:29] there and somebody hits you and he's a
[31:31] drunk if you sue him that's your
[31:33] business right but there ain't no
[31:35] brother going to be out there drunk so
[31:37] ain't going to be a brother praise the
[31:39] Lord all
[31:42] right and his eyes were as flame of
[31:46] fire brother Brown said there's nothing
[31:48] hidden that shall not be revealed for
[31:49] all things are naked before him with
[31:51] whom we have to do so his eyes was flame
[31:54] of fire try to skip through these pretty
[31:56] quick we did them a couple weeks ago
[31:58] just to refresh your memory Zechariah 4
[32:00] says they are the eyes of the Lord which
[32:02] run to and thr to and fro through the
[32:04] whole earth and that's what that's his
[32:07] Messengers that's his bride you and I
[32:09] the things we see the things we look at
[32:13] is what we're going to judge
[32:17] by I mean they're going to look at you
[32:19] and they're going to say well well
[32:20] there's a a lady with a long hair and a
[32:22] long
[32:23] dress God's going to say I told you to
[32:26] wear one
[32:28] and you turned it
[32:30] down amen that's what it's going to be
[32:32] and you walking through Walmart and
[32:33] somebody says sniggers and says old
[32:36] grandma you know what white thr judgment
[32:38] they going to stand there and God's
[32:40] going to say why' you call her an old
[32:41] woman why' you call her old grandma and
[32:44] they're going to go wow cuz remember our
[32:46] thoughts are louder in heaven than they
[32:48] are here on Earth
[32:50] amen that's how that's how why it's
[32:52] important that we come back to the full
[32:54] word of God all right we'll get to that
[32:57] this afternoon and his feet like a
[32:59] defined brass is burned in the furnace
[33:00] now what do we know brass brass
[33:02] signifies
[33:04] judgment but it stood the test of the
[33:06] fiery furnace a test that no other one
[33:08] has gone through and that is exactly
[33:10] right for brass signifies Divine
[33:11] judgment not just judgment Divine
[33:13] judgment a judgment that God decreed and
[33:17] brought to pass pus Vision the
[33:20] foundation of the altar of sacrifice
[33:22] with solid brass typifying the lamb
[33:24] slain from before the foundation of the
[33:26] world judgment had already passed upon
[33:28] him when as yet there were no Sinners
[33:30] salvation being entirely of the Lord now
[33:33] we know one thing for sure God can't
[33:34] changeed his mind so he's already judged
[33:36] everything back before the foundation of
[33:37] the world but he wants to prove to Satan
[33:40] why he judged how he judged and who he
[33:42] judged it through yes all right that's
[33:45] what we're doing we're here to prove
[33:46] that Satan can't control all of our
[33:49] being and all of our doings yes amen
[33:53] amen you still smoke drink and
[33:55] cuss why
[33:57] the devil's still out there making
[33:59] people do
[34:00] that cuz God's in your heart you've had
[34:03] a
[34:04] change but someday those feet of brass
[34:06] will stand upon the earth and the judge
[34:09] of all the Earth he shall be and with
[34:10] equity and Perfection will he judge
[34:13] Mankind and there will be no evading
[34:16] that
[34:17] judgment why because remember you're
[34:20] you're judging yourself here you're not
[34:22] going to go to the white Throne judgment
[34:24] and plead yourself out of something
[34:26] that's right
[34:27] right
[34:29] hello no you're not you you're going to
[34:32] plead yourself out
[34:33] here we accept what the lamb did here
[34:37] we're not when we get there as brother
[34:39] Bown says the tree falls that's where it
[34:41] lays the Bible says and he says whatever
[34:43] you are here death doesn't change you it
[34:46] just puts you in another place right
[34:49] there will be no evading that judgment
[34:51] no turning of that judgment there will
[34:52] be no tempering of it he that is unjust
[34:55] will be unjust still fil filthy filthy
[34:57] still the unchanging one will not change
[35:00] then for he has and never
[35:03] well these feet of br will crush the
[35:05] enemy they will destroy the Antichrist
[35:07] the Beast and the IM now through
[35:09] who through the
[35:11] bride he destroyed it at Calvary but
[35:14] that was his work to get started with
[35:16] that's right to give it to the bride yes
[35:18] and the Word was made what
[35:21] flesh they will destroy the Antichrist
[35:23] the beast in the image of all that is
[35:25] vile in his sight he will destroy the
[35:27] church systems that have taken his name
[35:29] only to corrupt his Brilliance and crush
[35:31] him along with the Antichrist all the
[35:33] wicked The Atheist agnostic modernistic
[35:35] liberals will all be there death hell
[35:38] and the grave will be there yes they
[35:40] will for when he comes the books will be
[35:42] open thank God he said books that is
[35:45] when even the lukewarm church and the
[35:47] five virgins will appear he will
[35:50] separate the sheep from the goats when
[35:52] he comes he'll take over the kingdom for

[36:10] Waters we know what Waters in The Bible
[36:12] signifies people all right people in
[36:15] tongues and Nations it is the Judgment
[36:18] for these are the voices of the
[36:19] multitude of witnesses like I said

[36:24] that puts people in heaven or hell right
[36:27] amen
[36:28] right so we need to watch how we
[36:32] act for those are the voices of the
[36:34] multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy
[36:36] Spirit All Through the Ages have
[36:38] testified to Christ and preached his
[36:40] gospel it will be the voice of every man
[36:42] rising in judgment Against The Sinner

[36:47] the seven Messengers will be heard loud
[36:50] and clear
[36:52] amen those faithful preachers who preach
[36:54] the saving power of Jesus who preach
[36:56] water baptism in Jesus name who preached
[36:58] the infilling and power of the Holy
[36:59] Ghost who stood with the word more than
[37:01] they stood with their own lives all of
[37:03] them were the voice of Jesus Christ by
[37:06] the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages oh

[38:03] voice in St John 11:38 that called
[38:05] Lazarus from the grave getting the bride
[38:07] together he's talking about this end
[38:09] time voice there's a voice in every age
[38:12] getting the bride together and then the
[38:13] resurrection of the Dead Sea to be
[38:15] caught up with it number five he had in
[38:18] his right hand Seven Stars now we know
[38:19] who those seven stars are there's seven
[38:21] different Messengers and he had them in
[38:23] his hand so they had to come from God I
[38:25] don't know these people that think
[38:26] brother didn't wasn't a messenger to the
[38:28] age there's got to be a messenger
[38:30] somewhere there's a number seven there
[38:31] somewhere cuz there's seven stars we
[38:34] know who the six are you got to realize
[38:37] number seven has
[38:39] come or we got to look for somebody else
[38:42] that's right cuz he's promised even in
[38:44] the hand of God and he don't make a
[38:45] mistake that's right they weren't in the
[38:48] hands of the devil they're in the hands
[38:49] of God yes he has his right hand Seven
[38:52] Stars we know what they were they're
[38:54] Messengers he said they are not called
[38:55] by name which she's going to name them
[38:57] here when we get into the church ages
[38:59] they're just for set forth as seven one
[39:01] to each age from the Ephesian on down to
[39:03] Lea each messenger brought the message
[39:05] of Truth to the people never failing to
[39:08] keep it the word of God to that
[39:10] particular Church age each one held to
[39:14] it they were steadfast in their loyalty
[39:16] to the original light as each age pulled
[39:18] away from God his faithful messenger
[39:21] turned that age back to the word and
[39:23] we'll look at that maybe later on how
[39:25] while the messenger comes at the end of
[39:27] the age and rebukes the previous age
[39:28] from falling away from their first love
[39:31] their strength was from the Lord and
[39:32] they never could have stemmed the tide
[39:34] they were safe in his camp for nothing
[39:36] could pluck them out of his hand in
[39:37] other words those seven had a purpose
[39:39] yes when they came on Earth it was to
[39:42] bring the people from One Church age
[39:44] into the other yes that's why we don't
[39:47] have another church
[39:50] age pma's vision and this Comfort is not
[39:52] for the seven Church AG Messengers
[39:55] only every every True Believer is in the
[39:57] hand of God and can draw from his love
[40:00] and power and receive the full benefit
[40:02] of all that God is to the believer what
[40:05] God gives the messenger and How He
[40:07] blesses and uses the messenger is an
[40:09] example to all believers of his goodness
[40:11] and care for all members of his body so
[40:14] you're included in that in that hand if
[40:19] you accept the message of your day all
[40:23] right Isaiah 49 says I have Graven thee
[40:26] upon the Palms of my hand thy walls are
[40:27] continually before me he's got you right
[40:29] here yes and like I said before when he
[40:32] went to Calvary if your hand if your
[40:33] name was in his palm that nail went
[40:36] through your
[40:37] name praise the Lord I don't know about
[40:40] you but mine was
[40:42] there you got to decide whether yours
[40:44] was or not and then live it out of his
[40:47] mouth went a sharp two-edged sword for
[40:48] the word of God is quick Hebrews 4 and
[40:51] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[40:52] sword piercing even to the dividing
[40:55] aunder of Soul and Spirit of joint and
[40:56] Marrow and is a discerner of the
[40:58] thoughts and intents of the heart when
[41:00] the true word of God comes it always
[41:02] divides when Jesus came on Earth there
[41:05] was a
[41:05] division every Church a master comes on
[41:08] the comes on there's a division all
[41:11] right even when Moses stepped on the
[41:13] scene there was a division God
[41:16] said I'll take care of them all Moses
[41:18] said no hang on a minute there's some of
[41:20] my people there so Moses stood up one
[41:23] day and said hey if you're for me get on
[41:25] this side on if you're for Dayan and
[41:27] Cory you stay over there and guess what
[41:29] happened about 3 minutes later the Earth
[41:31] opened up and swallowed several
[41:34] hundred Believers of another
[41:38] message that's the
[41:40] Bible out of his mouth go with the sharp
[41:42] sword so everybody had a message and
[41:44] everybody had something to listen to all
[41:47] right that with it he should Smite the
[41:49] Nations and ruling with a rod of iron
[41:51] let's keep going on but you know that he
[41:53] is revealing the heart secrets of men
[41:55] and women in this age in which we are
[41:57] living who else could reveal the secrets
[42:00] of the heart but the word
[42:02] himself all right it is the word is
[42:04] performing where unto it was sent for it
[42:07] the word is full of power it is the same
[42:10] spirit that was in Jesus the word that
[42:13] is present again in the church in the
[42:15] last days as a last sign trying to head
[42:17] the people off from judgment for they
[42:20] are rejecting him the word are now
[42:23] already coming to judgment crucifying
[42:25] him of fresh that's why brother ROM H he
[42:27] indicted this whole generation for
[42:29] crucifying Jesus Christ Again by their
[42:31] Creeds and dogmas and you know it's it's
[42:34] okay you can just go to church any way
[42:35] you want
[42:36] to no it's not went by a church just a
[42:40] few minutes ago women wearing them
[42:42] jogging riches
[42:44] things that's a
[42:46] disgrace a disgrace to
[42:51] God you wear them to work you going to
[42:54] wear them to church I hope none of y'all
[42:56] wear them at all I know we don't but
[42:58] that's just a disgrace but who taught
[43:00] them that somebody standing in the pull
[43:02] pit did if that preacher stand there one
[43:05] day and say hey you don't come in here
[43:07] with them things
[43:09] on or just preach the word of God and
[43:12] you'll see as as Cindy s Cindy
[43:18] did she just come on right in and
[43:21] accepted it and went right on Amen Let
[43:24] the Lord do it as brother L said let the
[43:26] Lord do it let the Lord divide this
[43:28] thing out let him let him do it he'll do
[43:30] it by his word every time no no man's
[43:33] idea involved amen that's what I like
[43:35] about those seven stars that was not
[43:38] man's idea he sent seven people on this
[43:41] Earth that had the mind of God or caught
[43:44] the mind of God for their age and you're
[43:46] going to be judged by that
[43:48] sir his countenance was the sun shineth
[43:51] in his
[43:52] strength Bible said in Matthew his face
[43:55] did shine as the sun
[43:56] remember even Moses under the blood of
[43:58] bulls and goats even Moses face shined
[44:01] and they had to put a a veil over his
[44:03] face because he he became listen now
[44:05] don't don't don't choke he became God so
[44:13] much till the till the Till The Shining
[44:15] Till The Shining of God was on him so
[44:17] much he was God to the
[44:20] people hello
[44:23] amen oh that's not no you know what that
[44:25] killed Jes Jus for they killed Jesus
[44:27] because he said he was God they didn't
[44:30] kill him for his good
[44:31] works Exodus 34 35 and the children of
[44:34] Israel saw the face of Moses that the
[44:37] skin of Moses face Shone and Moses put a
[44:39] veil on his face until he went in to
[44:42] speak with him Malachi 4
[44:46] verse1 we like four and five let's read
[44:49] first behold the day cometh it shall
[44:51] burn as an oven Malachi 4:1 and all the
[44:54] proud and all that do wickedly shall be
[44:55] stubbled and the day that cometh shall
[44:57] burn them up sayith the Lord of host
[44:59] that it shall leave them neither root
[45:00] nor Branch but unto you that fear my
[45:04] name to you that fear my name shall the
[45:07] son of righteousness arise with healing
[45:10] in his wings the healing campaign went
[45:12] forth and you shall go forth and what
[45:14] not just be healed but you're going to
[45:16] grow up yes start as a calf but you
[45:19] don't end up as a calf you end up as a
[45:21] full
[45:22] cow if I may say that I'm sorry if you
[45:25] take offense to that it's an
[45:31] allegory even the new
[45:34] city will have no
[45:38] light now I outside it may still be the
[45:41] Sun and the Moon I don't know they may
[45:43] have daylight and dark outside the city
[45:45] but inside that
[45:47] City where you and I are going to live
[45:50] Hallelujah we will be that light amen
[45:54] and that came unto me one of the seven
[45:56] Angels which had the seven vows full of
[45:57] seven last plagues and talked with me
[46:00] saying come hither I will show Thee the
[46:02] bride the Lamb's wife now he's going to
[46:04] show him the bride the Lamb's wife now
[46:06] what's he going to show him did he show
[46:08] him a
[46:09] person showed him a
[46:11] city and he carried me away in the
[46:13] spirit to a great and high
[46:15] mountain you can see a lot better when
[46:17] you're on a mountain and showed me that
[46:20] great City
[46:22] now I thought he was showing him the
[46:24] bride that's what he said come let me
[46:27] show you the Lamb's wife the
[46:29] bride and he carried me away in the
[46:31] spirit to great and high mountain and
[46:33] showed me that great
[46:34] city today I'm looking at the great
[46:38] City and all the dead in Christ are set
[46:41] sitting in a place of of nothing but
[46:43] pure
[46:44] light sixth Dimension brother R didn't
[46:47] say it was dark over here he said oh it
[46:48] was
[46:50] beautiful why because they were
[46:53] there they showed me that great City the
[46:56] holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
[46:57] from God and having the glory of God in
[47:01] her
[47:03] light her light was like into a stone
[47:06] most precious even like a jasper stone
[47:09] clear as what Crystal to display those
[47:12] seven colors of light coming from
[47:15] him Revelation 21:21 in the 12 gates
[47:18] were 12 pearls ever several gate was one
[47:21] Pearl and the street of the city was
[47:22] pure gold as it were transparent glass
[47:26] you're not going to be able to hide your
[47:28] things you're doing never
[47:32] mind you won't be no secret
[47:36] place it'll all be transparent you be
[47:38] sitting in your city and you'll be
[47:39] waving its
[47:40] people you be sitting in your house and
[47:43] waving at the
[47:45] people oh we're not going to do that oh
[47:47] I thought I'm sorry we're we're supposed
[47:49] to be doing the heart thing and floating
[47:51] on the
[47:54] cloud well I know most of you know this
[47:56] but I'm trying to play the bass guitar
[47:58] in in my secret
[48:00] time and I'm sure glad I'm not able to
[48:03] have to play a harp to get into
[48:06] heaven It Ain't Easy us Dales are not
[48:10] even used to we can't even
[48:12] hardly Mama laughs so hard as she fell

[48:17] in for the Lord the Lord can do
[48:20] Miracles okay I have a desire to play an
[48:23] instrument
[48:24] so for the Lord God Almighty and the
[48:27] lamb are the temple now look the Lord
[48:29] God Almighty and the lamb are the Temple
[48:30] of it and the city had no need of the
[48:33] sun neither of the moon to shine in for
[48:35] the glory of God now who's the glory of
[48:37] God you and I are the glory of God the
[48:39] glory of God did what lighten it it'll
[48:42] never go out once that City comes down
[48:44] it'll never go out and the lamb is the
[48:47] light thereof and the nations of them
[48:49] which are saved shall walk in the light
[48:50] of it and the kings of the earth do
[48:53] bring their Glory and Honor into it and
[48:54] the gates of it shall not be shut all
[48:57] day brother Danny you're going to have
[48:59] to get used to things not being
[49:03] locked if he could he'd lock his
[49:05] billfold in his
[49:07] pocket well I may need to do that anyway
[49:10] with anyway sister joy we appreciate her
[49:13] for there shall be for there shall be no
[49:16] night there so it's going to be
[49:18] illuminated by what you and I Crystal
[49:21] transparent gold you ever got that okay
[49:24] that's you
[49:28] am now let's go back to John and we'll
[49:30] get started right here on a new
[49:32] dispensation just for a minute when I
[49:33] saw him I fell his feet is dead now
[49:35] remember John types the bride right and
[49:37] he laid his right hand upon me who is he
[49:39] this one that was standing in the seven
[49:40] golden candle States saying unto him
[49:42] fear not I am the first and the last he
[49:45] keeps telling the first and the
[49:47] last I am he that liveth and was dead
[49:49] and behold I'm alive forever more amen
[49:52] and have the keys of hell and of death
[49:53] why are we scared write the things which
[49:56] thou H has seen and the things which are
[49:58] and the things which shall be Hereafter
[50:00] The Mystery of the Seven Stars which
[50:01] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[50:03] Seven golden candlesticks the Seven
[50:05] Stars are the Angels of the seven
[50:07] churches and the Seven candlesticks
[50:09] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[50:11] all right so God's got every bit of that
[50:13] in his hand he's got every bit of it in
[50:14] control what we have to do is like
[50:16] brother Ernie said we've got to plug
[50:18] ourself into
[50:19] that you're not automatically plugged
[50:22] into it you got to believe it you got to
[50:23] have yourself plugged in to the Eternal
[50:25] Word of God for your day so let's talk
[50:28] about a new
[50:29] dispensation Hebrews 10: 19 says having
[50:33] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[50:34] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[50:36] now here's Paul preaching a message and
[50:38] Paul was a pH I mean Paul was a
[50:42] Jew Paul actually participated in the
[50:47] ritual of the Old Testament rituals
[50:52] right so he's going against everything
[50:55] that he thought remember he said I got
[50:58] to forget everything he said everything
[51:00] I think is
[51:01] dung and I forget them or or do away
[51:04] with them to get this new dispensation
[51:07] started started by John the Baptist
[51:10] presenting Christ to the church and they
[51:13] what' they do to him they put him
[51:17] out here having therefore a Brethren
[51:19] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[51:20] the blood of Jesus by a new I want you
[51:23] to watch new and living
[51:26] living way not
[51:29] paper oh they love that Torah they could
[51:32] they could roll that scroll out and they
[51:33] could read what Moses said well they
[51:36] read backwards they could read what
[51:37] Moses said and oh we got Moses quotebook
[51:40] and we do everything Moses said we do
[51:44] everything Abraham he was our father he
[51:46] wasn't even a Jew Abraham is our father
[51:49] we have all this what are you doing and
[51:51] Jesus said if you have known them you'd
[51:53] known me cuz they spoke of me yes
[51:58] sir same way at the white thr judgment
[52:01] you know what God's going to
[52:02] say you know me through
[52:06] them you knew me through the preachers
[52:09] that preached the sermon to you by
[52:11] somebody that lived a life in front of
[52:12] you by somebody that testified to you
[52:14] that's how God's going to judge CU Jesus
[52:16] Christ is not on the Earth right now in
[52:19] natural
[52:20] form amen so where is he he's in
[52:24] you so if he's in you then
[52:27] you Christ in you the hope of glory by a
[52:31] New and Living Way which he ha
[52:33] consecrated for us through the veil that
[52:36] is to say his
[52:39] Spirit oh let me make it a little bigger
[52:43] his
[52:45] flesh through flesh he brought
[52:49] Redemption through your flesh he's going
[52:52] to bring
[52:53] Redemption oh I did this that yeah just
[52:56] keep thinking like that now let me tell
[52:58] you something real quick I was
[53:00] confronted by something the other day uh
[53:02] that was an old Doctrine many years ago
[53:04] and Dad um he's seen them all where
[53:08] there was a time where people were
[53:09] preaching sinless Perfection where that
[53:11] we're already you know there was another
[53:13] one where we're already in the
[53:15] Millennium and I told you what I'd like
[53:16] to do is take them to the Lion's Den and
[53:17] throw him in and see if they were in the
[53:19] Millennium or not cuz lons are not
[53:21] supposed to bite you in the Millennium
[53:23] all right well we'll find out take them
[53:25] to do I I don't believe that okay and I
[53:28] don't believe this sinless Perfection
[53:30] thing I don't believe that that just
[53:32] because you believe the message just
[53:33] because Christ is in your soul that
[53:35] you're perfect hold on a minute all
[53:38] three sections of
[53:40] you because there's three sections of
[53:43] you Soul spirit and body your body don't
[53:47] sin your body is just a
[53:49] vehicle to sin with or to hold a Bible
[53:53] with all right
[53:56] so God's working gradually then I'm not
[53:59] going to you know I wish it was that way
[54:01] remember I turned 64 last Friday I had a
[54:04] pain from then to now that I ain't never
[54:06] had
[54:07] before and so all the other ones say
[54:09] Amen all the young ones go what he
[54:11] talking

[54:16] talking about you just
[54:17] wait listen I hope Christ comes and I'm
[54:21] not kidding getting old ain't pretty no
[54:26] it ain't pretty at all what's that
[54:27] sister Trudy had a t-shirt or something
[54:28] gave it to dad said said old age
[54:30] something about old age she said but I
[54:32] didn't think it get here this fast
[54:36] okay but what I'm saying is listen don't
[54:40] look for that one
[54:42] day this pain is going to go
[54:45] away as we get closer to God I don't
[54:48] need my glasses
[54:50] anymore I
[54:52] wish don't don't don't come over here
[54:54] and say well well well I'm I everything
[54:58] I eat I'm not going there
[55:02] every and we're not heading toward
[55:05] something and we just going to get you
[55:07] know brother brother John's going to let
[55:08] his hair grow out and it's going to be
[55:09] like it was when sister Alicia met him
[55:11] and I know he was cute he's cute as a
[55:14] button do you understand what I'm
[55:17] saying the change tells us in the Bible
[55:20] that it we're changed in the
[55:22] what moment in the twinkling
[55:25] look twinkling of an
[55:28] eye that's when our change will come not
[55:31] that we're gradually as the word listen
[55:33] as Jesus Christ was the word as he
[55:35] gradually headed toward his body change
[55:38] it got
[55:40] worse but he had to believe sister Julie
[55:42] you got to believe believe Beyond The
[55:45] Impossible listen do you believe by
[55:48] these then you'll never believe you got
[55:51] to believe on what's In Here by what God
[55:53] Said Yes
[55:55] but this new testament we're going to
[55:58] take communion this
[56:00] afternoon so when we'll read the
[56:02] scripture where Jesus stands we'll read
[56:03] it right here but I want you to see
[56:04] something real quick a new testament so
[56:07] this is a new dispensation something
[56:09] new that's why it was hard listen that's
[56:12] why they killed every disciple of
[56:16] Jesus except John the B except John the
[56:20] Revelator they all were
[56:22] murdered cuz everywhere they went they
[56:25] hated it was something new it was some
[56:26] some new something I I kick him out of
[56:28] here well he keeps preaching well we're
[56:30] just kill him they cut Paul's head off
[56:33] didn't
[56:36] they but it's a covenant or a will a
[56:40] testament is a covenant or a will now
[56:43] that was a first Covenant remember the
[56:44] first Covenant God made it he said you
[56:48] eat of that tree you die you don't eat
[56:51] of that tree you'll live what they do
[56:53] they ate of that tree and they
[56:55] died right then he made a covenant with
[56:58] Abraham an unconditional Covenant he
[57:01] said Abraham you just hang on I'm going
[57:02] to do it for you that's
[57:04] right amen that's
[57:07] right and Jesus comes one day and he
[57:09] says he says a New Covenant we'll read
[57:11] it here in just a
[57:14] minute you remember when brother Donaldo
[57:17] was preaching about Matthew 242 24 where
[57:20] it exposed the two twins 242 24 well
[57:24] matth Matthew
[57:26] 2 Matthew 26:26 there was Jesus there
[57:30] was
[57:32] Judas and they were eating at the same
[57:34] table and all the disciples thought they
[57:37] were all
[57:38] good and as they were Matthew 26:26 you
[57:42] can't make these things up and as they
[57:43] were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed
[57:45] it and break it what we're going to do
[57:46] this
[57:47] afternoon and it is an open communion if
[57:50] I don't say it's an open communion but
[57:51] people if if you're not born again you
[57:53] should not take communion all right and
[57:56] he took the cup take eat this is my body
[57:58] and they're
[58:01] going okay and he took the cup and gave
[58:04] thanks and gave it to him saying drink
[58:05] ye all of it for this is my blood of the
[58:08] New Testament have you never heard that
[58:11] before they were under the old blls and
[58:15] goats take this up here put it on the
[58:17] altar kill it okay my sins are done but
[58:20] I'm going to go back and do the same
[58:21] thing I did before cuz there was nothing
[58:22] as an indwelling of the spirit of a lamb
[58:28] or two Turtle does is going to enter
[58:29] into you and make you a better person
[58:32] but this guy is which is shed for many
[58:35] for the remission of sins but I say unto
[58:37] you I will not drink henceforth of this
[58:40] fruit of the vine until that day when I
[58:42] drink it new with you and my father's
[58:44] Kingdom I was confronted again about we
[58:47] talk about the sinless Perfection people
[58:49] always want to get by with
[58:53] stuff
[58:55] well we don't take communion anymore
[58:57] because Christ has
[58:59] come well now I want to ask you a
[59:02] question for those of you that are in
[59:03] the
[59:04] message listen to his
[59:07] verbiage I say unto you I will not drink
[59:10] H henceforth of this fruit and he's
[59:11] holding the cup right of this fruit of
[59:15] the vine until that day when I drink it
[59:18] new with you in my father's
[59:22] Kingdom what is the Father's Kingdom how
[59:25] many quotes you want brother R said the
[59:26] father's kingdom is the baptism of the
[59:28] Holy Ghost so on the day of Pentecost
[59:31] when the father's Kingdom came the
[59:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why
[59:34] they took communion and we're supposed
[59:37] to take it until we go into his
[59:41] kingdom so don't go with me on that
[59:45] one Jesus said if you don't wash each
[59:47] other's feet said you don't have no part
[59:48] with him I'm just reading the
[59:52] Bible but it was something new and that
[59:54] were they were astonished by it I drink
[59:57] this but they really understood it
[59:59] because they didn't really understand in
[1:00:01] the upper room because where we going to
[1:00:02] get the scripture from is we're going to
[1:00:04] get the scripture from who Paul over in
[1:00:08] Corinthians right here 1 Corinthians 11
[1:00:10] we'll read it Paul by
[1:00:13] Revelation come on by Revelation Paul
[1:00:15] saw what they were doing and caught the
[1:00:18] revelation of it and said it's not
[1:00:20] eating his body it's not drinking his
[1:00:23] blood we're doing this in remembrance of
[1:00:26] what he
[1:00:27] did 1 Corinthians 11:4 and when he had
[1:00:30] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:00:32] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:00:33] you this doe in what
[1:00:36] remembrance of me and after the same
[1:00:39] manner also he took the cup and when he
[1:00:40] had up saying this cup is the New
[1:00:43] Testament see the Old Testament was
[1:00:45] covered under the blood of bulls and
[1:00:47] goats right but it just covered sin it
[1:00:50] didn't do away with it but this New
[1:00:53] Testament in the blood of a man which
[1:00:55] was God that life are is able to come
[1:00:58] back inside of me and
[1:00:59] you this do ye as often as you drink it
[1:01:03] in remembrance of
[1:01:06] me Hebrews
[1:01:08] 9:1 but Christ being comeing high priest
[1:01:10] of good things to come by a greater and
[1:01:12] more perfect Tabernacle listen that was
[1:01:14] a good
[1:01:16] one the kind of Glory came down in the
[1:01:19] Old Testament sh of Glory came down
[1:01:21] consumed a sacrifice he he he he covered
[1:01:25] those people's sins for the year he he
[1:01:27] he as brother DS always say he busied
[1:01:29] himself with the people he didn't he he
[1:01:31] knew they were going
[1:01:33] to he knew what they were going to do
[1:01:36] but that blood
[1:01:39] covered and he couldn't kill him right
[1:01:41] then right cuz he said do this through
[1:01:45] Moses all right each each ordinance but
[1:01:49] when you come to this new testament all
[1:01:51] right the Old Testament was over here
[1:01:54] the new New Testament is in the blood of
[1:01:56] a man blood of
[1:01:58] God and it's not just the chemistry of
[1:02:00] that blood it's the life that was in
[1:02:02] that blood that was almighty God that
[1:02:04] wasn't a second person of a
[1:02:06] trinity but Christ being come a high
[1:02:08] priest of good things to come by a
[1:02:10] greater and more perfect Tabernacle what
[1:02:13] was it his
[1:02:16] body not made with hands that is to say
[1:02:19] not of this building neither by the
[1:02:21] blood of goats and cows but by his own
[1:02:23] blood now look he entered in once into
[1:02:26] the holy Place having obtained Eternal
[1:02:29] Redemption for us praise God that's what
[1:02:32] Jesus did for us we couldn't do it for
[1:02:34] him we couldn't do it for each
[1:02:36] other he did it for us for if the blood
[1:02:39] of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a
[1:02:41] heer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to
[1:02:44] the purifying of the Flesh in other
[1:02:46] words we didn't need Jesus to
[1:02:47] come
[1:02:49] right that's not right though we needed
[1:02:52] a new testament Hallelujah how much more
[1:02:55] shall the blood of Christ who through
[1:02:57] the eternal spirit offered himself
[1:02:59] without spot to God Purge your
[1:03:02] conscience not cover it Purge it from
[1:03:05] dead Works to serve the Living God and
[1:03:09] for this cause he is the mediator of the
[1:03:11] New Testament so you got to have Christ
[1:03:13] starting The
[1:03:15] Testament all right everybody with me
[1:03:19] cuz you can't have a new testament
[1:03:21] unless you do away with the old
[1:03:23] one
[1:03:25] pretty
[1:03:26] simple that by means of death for the
[1:03:29] Redemption of the transgression that
[1:03:30] were under the first
[1:03:32] testament
[1:03:34] old they which are called might receive
[1:03:37] the promise of Eternal inheritance which
[1:03:40] is what eternal life in your body they
[1:03:42] did not have eternal life in their soul
[1:03:45] in the Old Testament right amen nobody
[1:03:49] did no John the Baptist didn't even have
[1:03:51] it in his soul right everybody with me
[1:03:54] he was in the Old Testament remember see
[1:03:57] that's why there's a difference in
[1:03:58] receiving the Holy
[1:03:59] Ghost and receiving the new
[1:04:01] birth it can be one and the same but you
[1:04:05] can be anointed by the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:07] your soul be as black as
[1:04:11] Satan that's what this new testament
[1:04:13] does for us cleans your soul out the
[1:04:17] real you that
[1:04:19] person for where a testament is now
[1:04:22] what's a testament it's a covenant or a
[1:04:23] will
[1:04:25] what are we doing today I have opened up
[1:04:27] the will that God gave us and I'm
[1:04:28] reading you the will all right right
[1:04:31] because his will is his what his will is
[1:04:33] his word for where a testament is there
[1:04:37] must also of necessity be the death of
[1:04:41] the testator amen amen all right Old
[1:04:46] Testament to make something new the old
[1:04:49] testators got to
[1:04:51] die right cuz remember Jesus didn't come
[1:04:53] in in the New
[1:04:55] Testament he came in the
[1:04:58] old the first book of the New Testament
[1:05:00] is the book of Acts
[1:05:04] right where a testament is there must
[1:05:07] also of necessity be the death of the
[1:05:08] testator for a testament is a force
[1:05:12] after men are dead so yeah Jesus had to
[1:05:15] die to come back and enforce this
[1:05:20] Testament but who did he who did he
[1:05:26] who do you enforce it
[1:05:28] by 120 on the day of Pentecost Peter
[1:05:30] stood up and said this is that this is
[1:05:33] what's starting this thing it's coming
[1:05:35] from us
[1:05:37] now Peter says look on us he didn't say
[1:05:39] look on Jesus he said look on
[1:05:42] us you saw us we just doing away with
[1:05:44] Jesus no we become him so much so
[1:05:48] the the world the world hates you he
[1:05:51] don't hate you remember what remember
[1:05:52] who was it somebody said oh Lord they
[1:05:55] hate me he said no they're not hating
[1:05:57] you they hate me inside of you that's
[1:05:59] what they're
[1:06:03] hating for a testament is a force after
[1:06:06] men are dead otherwise it has no
[1:06:09] strength that's why Jesus had to go away
[1:06:12] it's expedient that I must
[1:06:15] leave but I'm not going to stay gone I'm
[1:06:17] going to send you my
[1:06:22] spirit on the day of Pentecost
[1:06:24] I'm going to send my soul part of my
[1:06:26] soul back cuz see I can divide myself up
[1:06:29] cuz I'm
[1:06:31] God but I can't do it I have to preach
[1:06:34] Christ to you and then him give you that
[1:06:36] spirit I can't give it to you mama can't
[1:06:37] give it to you your daddy can't give it
[1:06:39] to
[1:06:40] you but it as of no strength while the
[1:06:43] testator was alive that's why when Jesus
[1:06:45] walked on the earth they didn't
[1:06:46] understand him right they hardly did
[1:06:49] anything he
[1:06:51] said Peter was always getting in trouble
[1:06:54] they were always getting in trouble they
[1:06:56] all Lord I'll be right there with you he
[1:06:58] said they won't be a one of you with me
[1:07:01] I got to do this alone cuz I'm
[1:07:07] God all what Calvary did for us don't
[1:07:09] ever forget
[1:07:13] it don't
[1:07:15] forget he died the testator died that
[1:07:20] body was cold and dead in the grave
[1:07:22] until it come back to life by the spirit
[1:07:24] that quickened it and that same spirit I
[1:07:26] thought Revelation I mean Romans 8 says
[1:07:28] what if that same spirit that raised up
[1:07:31] Jesus from the dead dwells
[1:07:33] in you he will Quicken your mortal Body
[1:07:37] by that spirit that dwells in you where'
[1:07:39] he at today is inside of me and you do
[1:07:42] we begin to commend ourselves or need we
[1:07:44] as some others Epistles of accommodation
[1:07:46] to you or letters of accommodation from
[1:07:48] you no we don't need no
[1:07:50] letter the letter kill it yes
[1:07:55] right
[1:07:56] yeah ye are our epistle written in our
[1:08:00] hearts known and read of all
[1:08:04] men remember the old phrase I can read
[1:08:07] you like a that's what you are amen this
[1:08:12] right here is not going to
[1:08:14] heaven it's going to disappear inside of
[1:08:17] you and you're going to become the book
[1:08:20] yes ain't that the way it happened with
[1:08:21] John he ate the book and the book was
[1:08:23] gone why it was part of
[1:08:25] John for as much as you are manifestly
[1:08:28] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[1:08:30] ministered by us Paul didn't have a
[1:08:32] problem with that Paul stood one day and
[1:08:34] he said if an angel from heaven come and
[1:08:35] preaches anything different than what I
[1:08:36] preached he said let them be a curse he
[1:08:38] said it twice right you say oh well
[1:08:41] you're not Paul well I got the same Holy
[1:08:43] Ghost Paul's
[1:08:44] got for as much as you are manifested
[1:08:47] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:08:49] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[1:08:52] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:08:55] God not in tables of stone but in
[1:08:58] fleshly tables of the heart and such
[1:09:02] trust have we through Christ to godward
[1:09:04] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:09:06] to think anything of ourselves all right
[1:09:08] he push you right back down on the same
[1:09:10] level but our sufficiency is of God and
[1:09:14] then God said I'm going to use you to
[1:09:16] get this to the people right who also
[1:09:20] hath made us able Ministers of the
[1:09:24] New
[1:09:25] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:09:28] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[1:09:31] giveth life now continue his thought but
[1:09:33] if the administration of death written
[1:09:35] engraven in Stones was glorious in other
[1:09:37] words what written in engraven in Stones
[1:09:39] The Ten Commandments remember the Ten
[1:09:41] Commandments came down God wrote them
[1:09:43] with his own finger and Moses had them
[1:09:45] in the tablets broke them had to go back
[1:09:46] up and get them again all right but if
[1:09:49] they were
[1:09:50] glorious so that the children of Israel
[1:09:53] could not step Ste fastly behold the
[1:09:54] face of Moses for the glory of his
[1:09:55] countenance which Glory was to be done
[1:09:57] away
[1:09:59] with right how shall not the
[1:10:02] ministration of the spirit be rather
[1:10:04] glorious for if the ministration of
[1:10:06] condemnation be glory don't do this
[1:10:09] don't do that do this don't do that much
[1:10:14] more do the ministration of
[1:10:16] righteousness exceed in
[1:10:20] glory praise the Lord Hebrews in verse
[1:10:24] one Donnie we got to read it for the law
[1:10:27] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:10:29] and not the very image now look it was a
[1:10:31] it was it was showing it was an example
[1:10:33] of what's coming every lamb that was
[1:10:35] killed turtle dove all that that was
[1:10:37] killed in the Old Testament type
[1:10:39] Christ right but but you had to do away
[1:10:43] with that to get Christ here to be the
[1:10:46] testator of the New Testament because he
[1:10:48] had to die but he didn't die and go away
[1:10:50] he came right back on the day of
[1:10:51] Pentecost and a group of people
[1:10:54] but look he can never with those
[1:10:56] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:10:58] year continually make the C there un to
[1:11:00] perfect for then would they not have
[1:11:03] ceased to be offered question mark
[1:11:05] because that the worshipper once purg
[1:11:07] should have no more conscience of sins
[1:11:11] but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:11:13] remembrance again made of sin every year
[1:11:17] every year the high priest had to go
[1:11:19] back dress in his things and do
[1:11:21] everything God said to do for it is not
[1:11:24] possible that the blood of bulls and of
[1:11:26] goats should take away sins wherefore
[1:11:28] when he cometh into the world he sayth
[1:11:30] sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest
[1:11:32] not don't give me those
[1:11:35] anymore I'm going to give my body a
[1:11:37] sacrifice amen but a body hast thou
[1:11:40] prepared me all right now where is the
[1:11:42] body of Christ now I'm looking at it a
[1:11:45] body thou has prepared me through seven
[1:11:48] Church ages through seven groups of
[1:11:51] people that are going to make up the
[1:11:52] Gentile dispensation
[1:11:54] and there going to be so much me they
[1:11:56] are me she is him we'll talk about it
[1:11:59] this
[1:12:00] afternoon in burnt offerings and
[1:12:02] sacrifices for sin thou Hast no pleasure
[1:12:05] then I said lo I come in the volume of
[1:12:07] the book it is written of me to do thy
[1:12:09] will are Thy word oh
[1:12:12] God above when he said sacrifice and
[1:12:14] offerings and burnt offerings and
[1:12:15] offerings for sin thou wouldest not
[1:12:17] neither has pleasure therein which are
[1:12:19] offered by the law then said he lo I
[1:12:22] come to do thy will
[1:12:24] oh God he taketh away the
[1:12:28] first all right he taketh away the first
[1:12:30] the stones the tablets the the the the
[1:12:33] even the holy of
[1:12:35] holies where's the holy of holies now
[1:12:37] I'm looking at it he taketh away the
[1:12:40] first that he may establish the second
[1:12:43] or new testament a new
[1:12:46] dispensation by the which shall by the
[1:12:49] which will we are Sanctified through the
[1:12:51] offering of the body of Christ once for
[1:12:53] all and every priest standeth daily
[1:12:55] ministering and offering often times the
[1:12:57] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:12:59] away sin but this man after he had
[1:13:02] offered one sacrifice for sin forever
[1:13:05] sat down on the right hand of
[1:13:07] God from hence forth expecting till his
[1:13:10] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[1:13:13] offering he hath perfected
[1:13:16] forever them that are
[1:13:20] Sanctified Hebrews 10: 19 having
[1:13:23] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[1:13:24] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:13:26] you couldn't go in that holy of holies
[1:13:27] in the Old Testament you
[1:13:30] died that was a man even touched the ark
[1:13:33] yes and he died that's how holy God
[1:13:36] is but by a New and Living Way he's
[1:13:39] driving us into the holy of holies he's
[1:13:42] pulled back the curtain remember what
[1:13:45] happened when Jesus was was crucified
[1:13:48] the temple that that big old curtain 200
[1:13:50] ft tall I believe it was covered that
[1:13:52] Mercy Seat
[1:13:54] now to show you man didn't do it it
[1:13:56] wasn't split from the bottom to the top
[1:13:58] it was split from the top to the bottom
[1:14:00] God did it he said hey here am I look
[1:14:02] out the
[1:14:03] window I have come in flesh and you've
[1:14:06] killed me you've rejected me but
[1:14:08] there'll come a group of people amen
[1:14:10] that'll be my body and do what I say yes
[1:14:13] sir by a New and Living Way amen which
[1:14:17] he ha consecrated for us through the
[1:14:20] veil that is to say his flesh
[1:14:25] brother B in the rising of the sun said
[1:14:27] he being the groom the bride has to come
[1:14:29] forth because it's part of him and it
[1:14:31] can only be the manifestation of the
[1:14:33] fulfilling of all the Revelation any
[1:14:36] other has spoken of the Bride now watch
[1:14:40] it can only manifest if it does
[1:14:42] something different from the groom it
[1:14:45] isn't the
[1:14:47] bride all right the characteristics of
[1:14:49] the Grooms got to be in The Bride for
[1:14:51] them to be together right all right is
[1:14:53] everybody with me if it does something
[1:14:55] different from the groom it isn't the
[1:14:57] bride because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:15:00] now we go back to Adam and
[1:15:03] Eve Adam and Eve uh Eve was literally
[1:15:06] bone of Adam and flesh of Adam just
[1:15:10] separated got it so that's what we're
[1:15:12] going back
[1:15:13] to all right now look CU remember a body
[1:15:18] thou Hast prepared
[1:15:20] me if it does something different from
[1:15:22] the GRE is in the bride because she is
[1:15:24] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[1:15:26] of his life power of his
[1:15:30] power she is
[1:15:33] him as man and woman are one and woman
[1:15:35] taken from his side she had taken a
[1:15:38] spirit the feminine Spirit from him the
[1:15:40] flesh from his side made both mechanics
[1:15:42] and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him
[1:15:45] and the Flesh of him and put it together
[1:15:47] made mechanics and Dynamics in other
[1:15:48] words until the church gets it back
[1:15:51] together we just going to keep having
[1:15:52] sermons
[1:15:54] now let's look here real quick we'll
[1:15:56] close right here Revelations 1 ver8 is
[1:15:58] what we'll get to this afternoon I am
[1:16:00] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:16:02] ending sayith the Lord which is which
[1:16:04] was which is to come the almighty what a
[1:16:10] statement you know I John who I'm also
[1:16:13] your brother and companion in
[1:16:14] Tribulation but John I'm sure his his
[1:16:18] normal mind went over here to now he
[1:16:21] never said that when he was here
[1:16:24] Jesus said a lot of things but he never
[1:16:26] said he was Alpha and Omega he never
[1:16:27] said he was the beginning and the end he
[1:16:29] never said he had the key to death in
[1:16:31] Hell well he
[1:16:32] didn't he had to die to become a new
[1:16:39] testament he was on the aisle of patmas
[1:16:42] for the word of God in the testimony of
[1:16:43] Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the
[1:16:45] Lord's day and heard behind me a great
[1:16:48] voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha
[1:16:51] and Omega the first in the life last
[1:16:54] what thou seest right in a book and send
[1:16:55] it into the seven churches which are in
[1:16:57] Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara
[1:17:00] Sardis Philadelphia Le out AA and I
[1:17:03] turned to see the voice that spake with
[1:17:04] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:17:06] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:17:08] seven candlesticks one liken too the son
[1:17:11] of man clothed with a garment down to
[1:17:13] the foot and G about to PS PS his breast
[1:17:16] we know that right with a golden girdle
[1:17:19] now why would Jesus be wearing something
[1:17:21] like that cuz he's in Bride form right
[1:17:25] amen and in the midst of the seven
[1:17:27] candlesticks one liken to the son of man
[1:17:29] clothed with a garment down to a foot G
[1:17:31] about his PS with a golden girdle now
[1:17:33] here's a couple of translations the
[1:17:35] diglot the original diglot says at the
[1:17:38] breast so cross here a belt of gold
[1:17:41] around his breast that's moffit's
[1:17:43] translation and then deity signifies
[1:17:46] what gold deity dedicated to death gold
[1:17:50] frankincense and merge what was given to
[1:17:52] Jesus by the three wise men and they
[1:17:55] weren't there when the baby was born

[1:21:06] listen this will be for later on for
[1:21:08] this afternoon the end time evangelism
[1:21:11] each age has had its message and its
[1:21:15] messenger seven stars seven
[1:21:18] candle all through the times every age
[1:21:21] has packed it message with a messenger
[1:21:25] god in every dispensation has set forth
[1:21:28] someone Anointed with the Holy Spirit to
[1:21:31] bring forth his message for that age
[1:21:34] every
[1:21:36] time now we can start back even from the
[1:21:38] beginning to Adam and Eve you sh shall
[1:21:41] not eat this you'll shall not do this
[1:21:44] that was the message and when man
[1:21:46] stepped across the message of the
[1:21:49] hour he's not talking about Adam and Eve
[1:21:51] no more when man Steeps across the
[1:21:54] message of the hour it brought death and
[1:21:57] chaos to the whole human race now that's
[1:22:00] how much the message
[1:22:06] means remember that wasn't just a
[1:22:08] complete blank denial of what God Said
[1:22:11] Eve missed it by one
[1:22:12] word she didn't deny God was God she
[1:22:15] didn't deny what God said she she just

[1:22:25] he sent a prophet down anointed to make
[1:22:27] that word come to pass and it supports
[1:22:29] the other one that was coming now watch
