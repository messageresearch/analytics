comes and we'll sing this chorus once more let let 20 24 be a year of Thanksgiving in your life there's a key to confessing and not just confessing but being thankful every time when brother Ram would pray for people they still had their condition he said go thank him thank him for what faith is calling that which is not as though it is whatever you have in your life that you need or you don't need just start thinking in for it and see that materialize that is speaking the word by faith and it is a heart of gratitude that God can come on the scene and when you realize it's not just what you don't have is the blessings you already have I mean that's what brother John was trying to show us this morning was what we already got in God that's our promises that's all he's just pouring out his riches God rich in Mercy to you start thanking him for it and see it come to pass I truly believe that you know brother Wade said 2023 was the letting out letting out now we got we got a a a basket full of Thanksgiving to give God back to and I truly believe if that is our confession start thinking him for the things you don't have you need you do have for your children for your family for the Holy Ghost for more of him whatever it is start thinking him for it and you'll see overcoming power in your life truly believe that do you believe that let's sing that chorus once more as by the way

was preaching you know and I said well I can also preach about with Liberty because he can also see what I can see what God is getting to give to know in this hour so we're not going to take a whole lot of time let's go straight to the word and I believe that is the the most important thing this hour you know I feel very happy and to see you and that you are the Warriors of this last age the ones that were ordained and to overcome the final challenge and there is a challenge and there was a man in the Bible called David and David and David was the indicated man to confront the final challenge that's why we want to speak in this hour now let's go straight to the Bible and then we're going to take uh the book of First of Samuel chapter 16 verse 17 all the way through 13 first of Samuel we're going to go all the way from Seven all the way through 13 we read the his word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his continent or on the height of his statue because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as men seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on their heart then Jesse called abinadab and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shama to pass by and he said neither hath the Lord chosen this and again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord had not chosen these and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all the children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for he will not sit down until he come hi and he and he sent and brought him in and now he was rooted and with all of his beautiful countenance and God goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the Horn of oil anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama and may you have it may you sit down and we want to title we want to title this in this hour this message a son of the eth confronting the final challenge you know a son of the eth he was called to confront the final challenge I want you to start looking in this hour and to start looking at this eighth child of Jessie that he was appearing appearing in the scene after the seven children of Jesse had gone by and now we know that those seven children of Jesse they represent the seven Church ages from Paul all the way to William Brown seven Church AG because that's how we can understand this what's taking place in this hour and he able to see the types of the Bible he be able to see the types and shadows of the Bible and seeing the types and shadows of the Bible and we can see what's taking place in this hour Glory Be The Name Of The Lord so in this scene of the seven children of Jesse you know it's showing us a mystery taking place in this hour you know God is going to have scientific spiritual scientific people that were going to be able to enter into the laboratory of God in order to take to take the things that taking place in these days now and to show the people what had been promised in this hour so that we would not be entertained in something else Glory Be The Name Of The Lord now when we see the seven children of Jesse they appeared in the scene and the seven children of Jesse showing the seven Church ages from Paul all the way to William bradam are we okay with this seven children of Jesse glory be the name of the Lord but he asked but he asked is that is that all the children and then he said no there still remaineth one glory be the name of the Lord and it was the eighth child and it was the eigh child of Jesse and this e child of Jesse and it was appearing in the scen because he was the one that was going to confront the final Challenge and there was a challenge in that hour and that challenge was Goliath and only David and only David can overcome and him so in that hour he was lifting up an eighth child of Jess he was lifting up that was going to be Anointed with oil with Revelation with the revelation of the GL be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now you know God is a god of varieties you know that is my way of preaching we all different from each other so may you tolerate me a little bit Glory Be The Name Of The Lord glory be the name of the Lord and now we can see that David that David was the eighth child of Jess and that was showing that that was showing that in this day was only the type it was the shadow of those children that were going were going to appear after the seven Church ages glory to God do we understand this language we can talk with confidence with this type of language because this is our language glory be the name of the Lord and then we can see that this eighth child of Jesse and it was the one that had the commission you know he was the one that had the weapons and to confront the final Challenge and what it was the final Challenge and it was Goliath glory to God because Goliath Goliath represents you know Goliath represents the World Church Council glory to God now we can see that this mystery of those children that they appear that those child that appear in this day after the seven had gone by those children today that we have appeared an eternal on an eternal life holy convocation you know Children of the you know Children of the eth day with eternity inside you know eternity is in this body glory to God you know I have a quote here I have a quote to share with you you know in the message the relative redeem page 11 the holy spirit said through brother Bram The Eternity The Eternity has fallen in a body called time and The Eternity is God Christ the word the Revelation had fallen in a body called time eternity eternity is inside of you glory to God and then it returns back to Eternity amen amen now we see you know that Jesse presented the seven children the first one went by and he said no no it's not this one and that was Paul you know then the second came and and the third child went by Columbus Luther Wesley Wesley William BR William Bram hallelujah hallelujah you know the program did not stop right there and the program of God has not stopped right there you know many arrived to that place and many you know stayed there and and spoke about how great how great William brandham was nothing against that and we know that he was a great prophet you know he was the greatest of all prophets but that torch is shut down Hallelujah and he went to the tomb amen he was one of the saints that is one of the saints that is resting right now but when he died you know when he died the program did not stop right [Applause] there and this is all the seventh but there's still remain it one so David so David was the eighth child of D of Jess you know and it's representing us nowadays you know is representing a group of people that was going to appear into the scene you know after the seven churches had finished glory to God speaking spiritually Le had finished for us already I'm not in Le anymore you know the Leah is blind and the Liah is dead I was taken from right there you know my soul had been raptured into to the holy convention and we were taken to the eighth glory to God you know that's where we find ourselves and we know that the seventh literally you know it finishes when we leave from here but spiritually speaking we are not there anymore we are in holy convention you know that is eternal age eternal life and that this is our language you know and you say brother where is this that you're speaking about and this is in the Bible this is in the scripture and you remember this that brother bam went straight to the scripture you know the scripture was his absolute glory to God you know I'm going to go ahead and open another scripture Hallelujah brother if you bear with me so it's in the message Hallelujah and I hope we're rejoicing my brothers Hallelujah okay it's in the message the future home the future home and this is uh in the it's in the 28th I believe in the page future home and it says okay see brother I can't find it here but I'm going to go do my best to translate it the best that I can go ahead brother and brother you could say this brother brandom what are you going to do now you know you your seven had run out what are you going to do now you a dispension dispension all the types of dispensational had run out are you going to put more than the seventh day how are you going to obtain it how are you going to do it where are you going to go now right amen that same spirit and those the spirits that are now glory to God very good you know I'm going too you to [Music] something you know me I have not run out out of dispensation I still have scripture for that I have another scripture glory to God and now he was going to go to the Bible and I continue reading now you say this brother [Music] brandom and brother are you trying to place something more than the seventh day and then they ask him where is your type now brother you know you say you're a a you're a type and then you have run out of types and brother Bram said no I have not run out of types no I have not run out of types now let's investigate now let's investigate we have run out of time brother went to the Book of Leviticus in The Book of Leviticus 23:36 and that is the scripture that he took because they were trying to Corner brother BR and they told him brother Bram you cannot go beyond the seventh and then brother Bram said this yes I can go beyond the seven and then he went straight to the scripture because the scripture because the scripture was the absolute of brother R and that was his absolute glory to God and today he is an absolute you know in our absolute is the same absolute that brother brandom had and that is the scripture and that's why in this day and so many things had come out so many ideas had come out so many things so many people just come out with so many things you know so many lines of the message but if all of this but if all of this we can take into the absolute and we would be able to see that that doesn't fit in the scripture but when we speak of this Eighth Day that is in the scripture glory to God we have something to back us up in the word of God so he went into the book of Leviticus Leviticus 23 we're just going you know we're just going through something that you already believe okay in the book of L 23 36 do you have it seven days ye should offer an offering made by fire on unto the Lord Seven Days Seven Ages and you will offer an offer in the E day people are scared at this they scared of this where did this came from and Jesus told the Pharisees you make a lot of mistakes in the scriptures search the scriptures they speak about me you know this is not worldly people there were religious people that they quoted Moses they quoted Moses there were people you know there were people just like the barrel of a gun they would quote Moses like nowadays they quote William brandom but they cannot see they cannot see that Moses spoke about Jesus that William Bram that William BR saw this glorious time right now that it was to come but he said this but he said I cannot continue beyond that I need to stop right hereu you know it was not his time anymore and now it was our time the children of the eth day manifested in this day glory to God hallelujah hallelujah seven days you shall offer an offer made by fire unto the Lord the E day should be a holy convocation and unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord no this offerings are not they're not they're not off those offerings are still lit because you rest in it Hallelujah glory to God okay you know I will try to advance a little bit more now now when we see David you know he was the eight child you know it was the one that's going to you know confront the final challenge so Satan you know Satan did not wanted him to go you know he didn't he wanted to fight against this eight child and he fought him to the final challenge you know he didn't want to you know he didn't want to go to the final challenge so Satan came you know and Satan came and he threw at him the bear you know wanted to hold back David you know and then Satan threw at him the lion wanting to stop David you know he wanted to kill him you know he wanted to kill David so David wouldn't go to the final challenge now he threw the lion at but the lion couldn't detain him or stop him and then the devil threw at him the bear the bear couldn't hold back David because David because David the eight child of he was the one that was going to go to the final challeng and that he was going to overcome and defeat Goliath you know because David had the oil he had the Revelation in that hour who he was he knew who he was in order to overcome Goliath and all of these things and all of these things were written there and showing us that the devil know the devil did not wanted to leave or does not want to leave he does not want to leave he does not want to he holding us back so we won't reach the final challenge you know the devil is holding us back so the devil did this he threw the World War I came which was the lion and then World War I came that was the bear what is this you know that is Satan want us want us to kill to kill us or grand grand grandparents where the seed was going to come through them Hallelujah you know the devil wanted to kill us through those events so you would not be here in this morning but he couldn't kill this because today right now because we are ordained we are ordained to go to the final battle in the Goliath today that is the World Council of churches hallelujah hallelujah the Holy Spirit came through the prophets and when she when she recognizes who she is what she's capable to do she will be an invisible Army Satan Satan you know Satan would be without any power none of the seven none of the seven confront could not confront goth no one you know from Paul all the way to William BR no one glory to God you know after the days of brother William Bram here are the children of the eighth day you know that is eternity inside of them in the word inside of them the Revelation inside of them and the book inside of them the sword inside of them glory to God hallelujah hallelujah here they are in this hour you're not we're the ones that would do the final mortal hits glory to God we can see in the Bible you know that everybody was full of fear they were full of fear there was G you know they were all afraid of Goliath no one could challenge Goliath but God had but God had already ordained he had already selected he had a little Pastor that you know that he was very agile that he can also play he can also play music so so all the demons can come out of Saul let me tell you something here are those Davids right now that they're playing those notes they're are playing those scripture notes you know those scripture notes you know those notes that continue on you know brother brandham left already those notes need to continue in order to confront in the Book of Revelations 9 hallelujah hallelujah so when David arrived you know everybody was with fear you know day and night they had fear you know Goliath was put fear among the people you know it's a psychological War hallelujah hallelujah you know he was speaking nonsense and if he would say you are nothing why do you come here to service you're nothing but Sinners you know that's what goliath was telling the people and that's what the Goliath right now that's what the Goliath right now is telling the people and nobody was able to respond back to Goliath no one was able to respond back to Goliath to a child of the E dat appeared Hallelujah and then he said this and who is this one that is not circumcised you know to be mocking the people glory be the name of the Lord and David told Saul and David told Goliath you know today is the day and this is the day 4 and the calendar of God judgment and today is the day and this is the 40 day where Goliath where Goliath was going to fall down to the ground glory to God so in this hour that Goliath that big mountain and that big mountain that big Goliath had been speaking to the people he had it all fear full of fear but here came the eighth child of Jesse could speak to that mountain and you speak to your mountain in this morning I don't know what is your Mountain I don't know what is your problem but if that problem but if that problem had not left you and it's because you have not spoken to your mountain and you speak to your mountain and that mountain needs to moveu so Hallelujah so David so David am Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory to God so David saw you know David saw today is the day you know 40 is the day of judgment 40 is judgment [Music] there was a child of Jesse right there which was the eighth child that had been separated they had been separated of the other seven glory to God so him so he had the anointing he had the Revelation that he had the oil that had been shed in David in order to confront to confront the challenge of that hour everybody else was shaken you know they were all scared you know they wanted to flee you know Saul didn't he didn't knew what to do but David and David knowing who he was you know David knew who he was but he said this the same one that same God that same God that liberated me from that from that lion that same God not other God no that same God he will liberate he will liberate me to overcome this big giant glory to God and she after the days of brother Bram there is a group group of people in this hour they have been called and to confront that time know to confront also the World Council churches brother brandham came out of the scene he left glory to God you know that is history now am amen we believe that he is a prophet you know God was in him the son of man you know a son of man and a son of man in a prophet but in 1965 and the son of man a prophet William Bram he left the scene but right now and then the son of man Jesus Christ in his bride today and you right now continuing continuing the program of God you know

notes in that music there's notes in that music you know there's notes within that music and then we return back to the beginning there is eternity there you know to a new beginning and then in the Book of Revelations 10 you know that did not finish everything you know it was the last prophet of his age the last one of his age you know all of them are finished now and God only use one man you
