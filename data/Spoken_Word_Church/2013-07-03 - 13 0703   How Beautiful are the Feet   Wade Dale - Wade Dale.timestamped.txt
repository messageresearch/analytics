[5:16] morning did a wonderful job just keep
[5:19] him in your prayers all right if you got
[5:20] your Bibles let's turn to the Book of
[5:25] Ruth and I told you a while back that I
[5:27] was studying on
[5:31] feet kind of funny but Claude and I were
[5:35] talking the other day and he said you
[5:36] know on Wednesday night he said you need
[5:37] to just kind of be just a little bit
[5:40] easy on the people and not be so hard
[5:42] because they're thinking about work and
[5:44] what they did at work and what they're
[5:46] going to do tomorrow at work he said so
[5:48] just give them something easy I said
[5:49] okay we're going to talk about feet
[5:50] today so and the title is how
[5:54] beautiful are the feet because the Bible
[5:57] completely talks about the feet and
[5:59] we're going to go go through you need to
[6:00] keep your Bible or you can keep watch up
[6:03] here because we're going to read about
[6:05] 14 or 15 different
[6:07] scriptures all the way through the Bible
[6:09] so let's bow our heads and speak to the
[6:12] author before we begin dear heavenly
[6:14] father we pray tonight that you would be
[6:18] here Lord as the active participant in
[6:21] this service you be the one that does
[6:23] the speaking father and you be the ones
[6:25] that do the do the
[6:27] hearing and the seeing
[6:30] and all the things Lord that we need for
[6:32] this service because without you lord
[6:34] it's just a meeting of of human beings
[6:37] and truly we do have a lot of things we
[6:39] are thinking about and work and stress
[6:43] and family and all these things but Lord
[6:45] let us lay that aside just for a little
[6:47] time and let us listen to you father we

[6:54] refueling in the middle of the week Lord

[7:10] thank you for giving us that
[7:11] Independence so far we know that there
[7:14] time will come Lord where that will be
[7:15] shut off but Lord until then you've give
[7:18] us the privilege to stand before a group
[7:21] of people Lord and speak our mind father
[7:24] we pray that you'd be with the
[7:25] missionaries on the Foreign Fields lord
[7:26] they're getting ready to come for the
[7:28] August Camp may you be with them as they
[7:30] travel take care of them Lord be with
[7:32] brother Claude just raise him up for
[7:34] your honor and glory Lord and strengthen
[7:36] him give him someone to help him out
[7:38] there Lord we pray that you just be with
[7:41] each one that's not here tonight
[7:43] whatever the need may be Lord may you
[7:45] just meet that tonight father forgive us
[7:47] of our sins and our many mistakes as we
[7:49] Endeavor to talk about you tonight in
[7:52] Jesus name we pray
[7:54] amen Ruth now in the Book of Ruth we see
[8:00] that she is come up here to chapter 3
[8:03] and Naomi is telling her what to
[8:06] do and we see the type and what but
[8:09] watch the type because I just kind of
[8:10] want to show you where the start of of U
[8:15] of looking at
[8:16] Redemption because feet actually shows
[8:20] Redemption and we'll go back even Into
[8:23] the Book of Genesis Where Feet shows
[8:25] Redemption and this is by
[8:27] far uh put in feet footstep walk um soul
[8:32] of your all those things and you'll get
[8:34] probably 200 scriptures so we're just
[8:36] kind of gleaning the ones that we need
[8:38] right now and this is kind of a lengthy
[8:40] reading so I tell you what let's read
[8:42] let's read the first verse and then you
[8:44] can be seated and we'll just all read it
[8:45] together I know I know it's TI where
[8:47] everybody's tired and and uh and weary
[8:50] so let's read the first part and it
[8:51] shall be when he lith down now Naomi is
[8:54] telling her this because remember Ruth
[8:57] is a gentile right
[9:00] she does not know the
[9:02] customs of the Jews because her husband
[9:06] died at very young age so they didn't
[9:09] have time to to maybe Converse about
[9:13] what needed to be done actually while he
[9:16] was alive they didn't need the right of
[9:17] redemption he owned the land and Naomi
[9:20] and her husband and the sons they had
[9:22] the property but they all died and they
[9:25] all died to give us an example to show
[9:28] us that Israel
[9:31] has the right but when they lost that it
[9:33] went to Ruth but watch how it happens
[9:35] and it shall be when he lieth down verse
[9:38] four that thou shalt Mark the place
[9:41] where he shall lie and thou shalt go in
[9:44] and uncover his
[9:46] feet and lay thee down and he will tell
[9:49] thee what Thou shalt do now you may be
[9:52] seated and let's just read the rest of
[9:53] it now watch how positive she is showing
[9:58] what she said and he will tell thee what
[10:01] Thou shalt do she's got an idea she
[10:04] knows that in the right of redemption in
[10:06] Israel that to claim what she had lost
[10:11] she had to find a nearer Kinsman amen
[10:14] all right so she found a near Kinsman
[10:16] she knew Boaz and actually here she's
[10:18] going to know she's going to know how he
[10:21] acts because she and he will tell thee
[10:24] what Thou shalt do now it's not Boaz
[10:27] telling Naomi which is telling Ruth
[10:31] right right it's Boaz is going to talk
[10:35] straight to Ruth amen all right so watch
[10:37] this and she said unto her all that thou
[10:39] sayest unto me I will do look how
[10:42] obedient that's where you start The
[10:44] Obedience and she went down unto the
[10:47] floor and did according to all that her
[10:48] mother-in-law bade her and when Boaz had
[10:51] eaten and drunk and his heart was merry
[10:52] he went to lie down at the end of the
[10:54] Heap of corn now remember he was on the
[10:56] threshing floor and he came softly and
[10:59] and she came softly and uncovered his
[11:03] feet that's a safe place to lay down
[11:07] yeah come on she didn't lay down beside
[11:09] his body she laid down beside his feet
[11:13] amen all right submission all right and
[11:16] and and covered her feet and laid her
[11:18] down and it came to pass at midnight
[11:20] that the man was afraid and turned
[11:22] himself and behold a woman lay at his
[11:24] feet and he said who art thou and she
[11:26] answered I am Ruth thine handmaid spread
[11:29] therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid
[11:31] for thou art a near Kinsman and he said
[11:36] blessed be thou the Lord my daughter for
[11:38] thou H has showed more kindness in the
[11:40] latter end than at the
[11:43] beginning
[11:44] Gentile in the latter end all right in
[11:47] as much as thou Fest not young men where
[11:50] the poor
[11:52] Rich and now my daughter fear not I will
[11:55] do to thee all that thou thou request
[12:00] huh she hadn't said a word to him
[12:02] yet she hadn't said a word to him yet
[12:05] all right or
[12:06] required for all the city of my people
[12:09] doth know that thou are a virtuous woman
[12:12] that's what I was telling I was giving
[12:13] them a challenge when I was speaking in
[12:15] the past two churches the past two
[12:17] weekends I challenged the
[12:20] pastors I want you I want the uh we've
[12:24] been kind of passionate around between
[12:25] Brother Richard Roberts and myself and
[12:27] brother Anderson and brother Joe and
[12:30] brother Bob and uh there's a YouTube
[12:33] video of a Baptist
[12:36] Minister and I I'd like to show it he
[12:39] walks down where somebody's asleep he
[12:41] walks down and pushes their head up and
[12:44] he says wake
[12:47] up and he said oh you think he's going
[12:49] to leave the church and not come back
[12:51] he's not here to begin with then he
[12:54] walks about two floors back and he
[12:56] points at two people and he said I'm
[12:58] fixing to marry you to he said you two
[13:00] ain't been Church in 6 months said you
[13:01] ain't worth 15
[13:04] cents then he points back at the video
[13:07] room and he says brother Cox he said me
[13:08] and you going to have a talk you need an
[13:10] attitude adjustment you're building a
[13:13] kingdom to yourself and me and you are
[13:14] going to have a talk about it and he
[13:17] said you know what if y'all want to vote
[13:18] me out I'll go find somebody that'll
[13:20] listen to this in other words he was
[13:22] saying I'm about finished it with these
[13:24] people anyway but anyway but you watch
[13:26] and see I I was telling the the pastors
[13:28] and the and the group and even being in
[13:31] our Sunday school class there with the
[13:33] Statue of a perfect man I kind of stayed
[13:35] on that with the U with the Sunday
[13:37] school class and over into brother
[13:39] dutches and brother claud's and I I
[13:41] challenged them I said look we have got
[13:44] it's a requirement that we have these
[13:47] virtues it's a requirement that we have
[13:50] these virtues but it's a requirement to
[13:52] get the people born again first if
[13:54] they're not born again it's about time
[13:56] to point at them and say you're not born
[13:57] again you're not acting right
[14:00] right amen come on if a Baptist preacher
[14:03] can walk
[14:05] out and tell the people ain't worth 15
[14:09] cents and the big boy stood up and he
[14:12] went over and shook his hand and hugged
[14:13] his neck he said you know I love you and
[14:15] that's what he said to the people he
[14:16] said you know I love you he said I love
[14:18] your soul he said I'm that's what I'm
[14:21] here for I ain't worried about your body
[14:22] he said I'm here to save your soul and
[14:24] you know what I I he got a lot of amens
[14:27] but he he got a lot of Silence in some
[14:28] of the other
[14:29] but I've challenged the the ministers to
[14:32] to maybe focus more on the Statue of a
[14:35] perfect man because that's a requirement
[14:37] and that's a that's a stumbling block to
[14:41] others but it should be a a powerful
[14:44] thing that we use in our services in our
[14:49] daily life in our daily walk and when we
[14:51] come to church we don't have to worry
[14:53] about getting rid of all that stuff
[14:54] there's enough to get rid of anyway but
[14:57] that's what we're talking about today
[14:58] though Redemption how beautiful are the
[15:01] feet but let's continue and now is it
[15:03] true that I am thy near
[15:04] Kinsman cuz see right here watch the
[15:07] report in 311 watch the report for all
[15:11] the city of my people doth know that
[15:14] thou art a virtuous woman her walk
[15:17] compared with her talk amen all right
[15:21] and now is it true that I am thy near
[15:23] Kinsman how be it there's a Kinsman
[15:25] nearer than I now we knew who that was
[15:28] but what
[15:30] tarry or wait this night and it shall be
[15:34] in the morning that if he will perform
[15:36] unto thee the part of a Kinsman well let
[15:38] him do the Kinsman part but if he will
[15:40] not do the part of a Kinsman to thee
[15:42] then will I do the part of a Kinsman to
[15:44] thee as the Lord liveth lie down until
[15:46] the morning he didn't have a
[15:48] problem he didn't have a problem with a
[15:51] beautiful woman laying at his
[15:53] feet you know why she was a virtuous
[15:56] woman right she didn't have a a bad
[15:59] reputation when she walked in the church
[16:00] door
[16:02] right that's what I'm telling you about
[16:04] this feet feet walk our walk we're going
[16:07] to get into that and she'd lay at his
[16:10] feet until the
[16:12] morning she didn't have to get up right
[16:14] then and leave she laid there until the
[16:16] morning and she rose up before one could
[16:17] know another and said let it not be
[16:19] known that a woman came and he said let
[16:21] it not be known that a woman came into
[16:23] the floor also he said bring the veil
[16:26] that thou has upon thee and hold it he's
[16:28] not going to let let her go with nothing
[16:30] right he's going to give her something
[16:32] to sustain her until he does this right
[16:35] of redemption amen all right he's not
[16:37] going to leave her
[16:39] hungry he's going to feed her bring the
[16:42] veil that thou has upon the and hold it
[16:44] and when she held it he measured six
[16:46] measures of barley and laid it on her
[16:48] and she went into the city all right we
[16:51] know what that was that was a
[16:52] sustainable amount that was the seal
[16:54] that was the six seals that that God has
[16:57] laid on us why cuz give it to a virtuous
[17:00] woman right right come on people I'm
[17:02] going to stay on this until y'all hate
[17:04] me or love me one of the two we have got
[17:06] to get our life straight amen and if not
[17:10] maybe we need to leave for a
[17:13] while just the way it is if a Baptist
[17:16] preacher can say it so can
[17:21] I cuz these virtues when they begin to
[17:24] work it weed out a lot right
[17:29] Peter James John yeah all those people
[17:32] sure Paul had a problem with a witch but
[17:36] one day God just nodded at him and he
[17:39] got rid of that witch
[17:41] right not calling anybody witch but God
[17:44] God will God will do just a little bit
[17:46] he's longsuffering but he'll cut it off
[17:50] when it's time to cut it off Paul turned
[17:51] around and rebuked her all right got it
[17:55] sorry and when she came to her
[17:56] mother-in-law said who art thou my
[17:58] daughter and she told her that the man
[17:59] had what the man had done to her and she
[18:01] said these six measures of barley gave
[18:03] he me for he said to me go not empty
[18:06] unto thy motherinlaw then said she sit
[18:09] still my daughter Ruth
[18:12] resting all right until thou know how
[18:15] the matter will fall for the man will
[18:18] not be in rest
[18:21] right it's all laid on him now it's all
[18:25] laid on him there is nothing she can do
[18:28] it's all all laid on this man until he
[18:31] have
[18:34] finished until he have finished remember
[18:37] Jesus said on the cross he said it's
[18:39] finished amen the right of redemption
[18:41] he's finished all right it until he have
[18:44] finished a thing this day now let's go
[18:47] to Ruth 4 verse 7 because this is going
[18:50] to
[18:51] explain what he's going to do now this
[18:54] was the manner in former time in Israel
[18:57] concerning redeem and concerning
[18:59] changing for to confirm all things a man
[19:03] plucked off his
[19:04] shoe right off his feet
[19:08] right and give it to his neighbor and
[19:11] this was a testimony in
[19:13] Israel other words they came out before
[19:16] the whole crowd neighbors and
[19:19] all therefore the Kinsman sent un to
[19:22] Boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his
[19:24] shoe and Boaz said unto the elders and
[19:26] to all the people ye are witnesses
[19:29] this day that I have bought all that was
[19:32] imich and all that was chalion and
[19:34] Marion
[19:36] melons of the hand of Naomi so here he
[19:39] comes and he shows the right of
[19:41] redemption he takes a shoe off of his
[19:43] foot and says I claim what is Naomi's
[19:48] all right to restore or to redeem back
[19:51] so there's your right of redemption so
[19:54] now in Genesis 3:15 let's show the first
[19:56] thing that God's going to do this is
[19:59] what he's going to show he said I'll put
[20:00] enmity between thee and the woman and
[20:04] between thy seed and her seed it shall
[20:06] bruise thy
[20:08] head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[20:12] right at Calvary Satan bruised Jesus
[20:17] heel right there was the right of
[20:20] redemption God said I'm going to redeem
[20:23] from
[20:24] this you may bruise my heel but I'm
[20:27] going to crush your head right all right
[20:30] you can hit somebody in the foot and it
[20:31] won't kill them right hit somebody in
[20:33] the head it'll kill them so we see the
[20:36] Promise there but watch how we unfold
[20:39] this and see in Psalms 99 like I said
[20:41] we're going to just read a lot of
[20:42] scriptures
[20:44] tonight and the reason I'm hot I still
[20:46] got my cat
[20:49] on okay now
[20:53] look now we're going to look up this
[20:55] word because I have been looking at this
[20:58] and I know that we've read it many times
[21:01] but watch Psalms 995 says exalt thee
[21:05] Lord Our God and worship at his foot
[21:07] stol for he is
[21:09] Holy now I want you to watch how this is
[21:12] going to unfold and watch how this comes
[21:14] about this foot stol and watch where it
[21:18] came from all right exalt the Lord Our
[21:21] God and worship at his foot stool for he
[21:23] is Holy a Psalm of David the Lord said
[21:25] unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand
[21:28] until I make thine enemies thy foot stol
[21:31] all right there's the foot he talking
[21:33] about the feet again now let's go to
[21:35] Isaiah
[21:37] 66 verse one thus sayith the Lord the
[21:40] heaven is my throne and the Earth is my
[21:42] foot
[21:43] stol so where is the right of redemption
[21:46] going to happen not in heaven amen it's
[21:49] going to happen on Earth there's got to
[21:52] be something of a possession on
[21:55] Earth not in heaven amen
[21:59] actually it's in Earth yeah not on
[22:03] Earth thus sayith the Lord the heaven is
[22:05] my throne and the Earth is my foot stol
[22:07] where is the house that you build unto
[22:10] me now what house is he talking
[22:12] about huh talking about brick and mortar
[22:15] you talking about a tabernacle he said a
[22:18] body thou has prepared me all right so
[22:21] here's you and I it's going to come down
[22:23] to where it's going to be our
[22:25] feet cuz Jesus's feet does not we read
[22:28] in Jeremiah not until the Millennium
[22:30] does his feet touch this Earth so
[22:33] where's the right of redemption going to
[22:34] come from Boaz if your feet are not
[22:36] standing on this earth
[22:38] right oh Boaz where are
[22:41] you Christ in you the hope of glory amen
[22:45] where is the house that you build me and
[22:46] where is the place of my rest for all
[22:49] those things hath mine hand made and all
[22:51] those things have made have been sayith
[22:54] the Lord but to this man will I look
[22:56] even to him that is poor and of a spirit
[22:59] and trembleth at my words brother Claude
[23:02] and I were talking the other day about
[23:04] uh repentance you know the Bible says
[23:06] repent and be baptized in the name of
[23:08] Jesus Christ and that's our problem um
[23:11] you know we we say forgive me Lord or
[23:13] forgive me Lord forgive me Lord after
[23:16] about 45 times he quits listening
[23:20] yeah because the Bible said Godly
[23:24] sorrow leadth a man to repentance right
[23:27] Godly sorrow you you got to really be
[23:29] sorry for it you got to really be sorry
[23:32] for it amen then God will forgive you
[23:34] but just say to forgive me Lord that's
[23:36] just vain jangling right all right now
[23:38] let's go to Hebrews
[23:41] 10 cuz I wanted to see how this evolved
[23:43] brother dick always enjoyed Heaven is my
[23:46] throne and Earth is my foot foot stool
[23:48] and and I always wanted to know where
[23:50] that foot stool came from well I kind of
[23:53] see it as a metaphor being down here and
[23:55] God putting his feet on the earth Heaven
[23:57] is my throne and Earth is my foot stol
[24:00] but really with with looking at
[24:02] Footprints and looking at feet being
[24:04] talking about Redemption we see that
[24:06] that foot St I want you to watch what
[24:08] happens here because they explain it in
[24:11] the Greek Lexicon but then it gives you
[24:13] a scripture for it cuz it goes all the
[24:15] way back into the Old Testament Hebrews
[24:17] 10: 12 says but this man after he had
[24:20] offered one sacrifice for sin forever
[24:23] sat down on the right hand of God now
[24:25] who's he talking about Jesus Christ the
[24:26] man that does the right of redemption
[24:28] right from henceforth expecting till his
[24:32] enemies be made his foot
[24:35] stol for by one offering he ha perfected
[24:38] forever them that are Sanctified now
[24:41] let's go to the Greek Lexicon and look
[24:43] up that word foot stool the word foot
[24:47] stool is
[24:49] hod but watch what it
[24:52] says to make one a foot stol of one's
[24:55] feet I.E the subject to reduce under
[24:57] one's
[24:58] power a metaphor taken from the practice
[25:02] of conquerors who plac their feet on the
[25:05] necks of their conquered enemies yeah
[25:08] what did David do jumps up on Goliath's
[25:11] neck right takes his sword out steps on
[25:14] his neck cuts his head off but watch
[25:16] here it happened in Joshua also in the
[25:19] Book of Joshua 10:
[25:22] 24 and it came to pass when they brought
[25:25] out the Kings those kings under Joshua
[25:27] that Joshua called for all the men of
[25:29] Israel and said unto the captains of the
[25:31] men of War which went with him come
[25:33] near put your
[25:37] feet put your feet right exactly not
[25:41] Joshua's feet Joshua type of the Holy
[25:43] Ghost he said you put your feet right
[25:46] you put your feet upon the necks of
[25:48] these Kings in other words you're the
[25:50] one that fought the
[25:51] Battle right cuz it was the captains of
[25:55] the men of war and they came near and
[25:57] put their feet upon the necks of them
[26:00] right and Joshua said fear not nor be
[26:03] dismayed be strong and of good courage
[26:05] for thus shall the Lord do to all your
[26:08] enemies against whom you fight right
[26:11] there's your foot
[26:13] stol putting your foot on the
[26:17] enemy what's The Last Enemy to be
[26:20] destroyed death all right but you know
[26:23] what it doesn't differentiate and make
[26:26] death something more than this no says
[26:29] you stay there until you make the
[26:30] enemies your foot stol you stay right
[26:32] there and then The Last Enemy to be
[26:34] destroyed is death all right let's go
[26:37] right here for thus shall the Lord do to
[26:40] all your enemies against whom ye fight
[26:44] so Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot
[26:45] stol you say well what's that got to do
[26:47] with it there's your right of redemption
[26:49] because you got to redeem the land what
[26:51] happened Joshua went in to what
[26:54] possess the land that was supposed to
[26:56] been his it was supposed to been
[26:58] Israel's to start with right he told
[27:02] them to go get it 40 something years
[27:04] before
[27:06] then right 40 something years he said
[27:09] this is your land right go in and
[27:11] possess it but it took the Holy Ghost
[27:14] Joshua to step up and say
[27:18] hey this is what you're going to do to
[27:20] your enemy and not one of them going to
[27:22] be able to stand against
[27:25] you what a mighty God we serve yes Lord
[27:29] now let's look at at a few scriptures
[27:31] here CU I want to set something up to
[27:33] get into
[27:35] Isaiah but Psalms 26:12 says my foot
[27:38] standeth in an even
[27:41] place in the congregation will I bless
[27:44] the Lord Jeremiah 12:10 says listen to
[27:47] this many pastors have destroyed my
[27:50] Vineyards that says pastors right not
[27:53] pastures pastors right so many pastors
[27:56] have destroyed my Vineyard they have
[27:57] tried my portion Under Foot what their
[28:02] foot not the right of redemption not the
[28:04] foot of redemption but under their foot
[28:06] they have made my Pleasant portion a
[28:09] desolate Wilderness all right now look
[28:12] in the Book of
[28:13] Revelations we're going to carry it
[28:15] through and then step back CU I want to
[28:16] make a point here in the book of Isaiah
[28:18] Revelations 1:13 says in the midst of
[28:20] the seven golden candlesticks like un to
[28:23] the son of man clothed with a garment
[28:24] down to the
[28:26] foot all the way down it didn't come to
[28:28] the knees he went all the way to the
[28:30] foot full Redemption when he was
[28:32] standing in the Book of Revelations 13
[28:34] there was full Redemption all right and
[28:37] G about the PS with a golden girdle so
[28:39] that's you and I right that's bride form
[28:43] right so it's garment down to the down
[28:47] to the foot amen this garment's got to
[28:49] cover all the way to the foot all right
[28:53] cuz you got to get down to the feet to
[28:54] get the Redemption amen
[28:58] kind of easy kind of simple but you know
[28:59] what maybe if you'll think about feet
[29:01] cuz when we get to the end of this thing
[29:04] something we do all the
[29:06] time and Jesus was telling them what he
[29:09] was going to do and they didn't have a
[29:11] clue they didn't have a clue all right
[29:14] so
[29:15] watch but look in Revelations 10:2 and
[29:19] he had in his hand a little book open
[29:21] and he said his right foot upon the sea
[29:24] and his left foot upon the Earth what's
[29:27] he coming back to do right Redemption
[29:30] that's not in heaven right he said his
[29:32] right foot upon the sea and his left
[29:35] foot upon the Earth he's down here this
[29:38] is where Redemption is going to take
[29:41] place we know it was 2,000 years ago in
[29:44] the mind of God we know that but it's
[29:45] got to come physical here all right
[29:49] because what it was lost down here and
[29:52] this is where it's got to be redeemed
[29:54] all right so now let's look at Isaiah
[29:58] because look Isaiah 52:7 ver8 7 and
[30:02] 8 we know that comes to maybe to
[30:06] preachers or because we're going to read
[30:09] two in Romans 10 cuz it it kind of
[30:10] expounds on that but in Isaiah 52:7 it's
[30:14] like I've always said this is not just
[30:16] to the
[30:17] preachers how beautiful are your
[30:20] feet how beautiful upon the
[30:24] mountains are the feet of him the feet
[30:28] why is it why is it keep talking about
[30:29] the
[30:30] feet feet and
[30:34] Mountain you know what all Caleb wanted
[30:39] he didn't have no
[30:40] inheritance the tribe of Judah got
[30:42] something else Caleb was standing there
[30:44] and Joshua said what do you want there's
[30:46] nothing else to give he said I've had my
[30:49] eye on that mountain right
[30:51] there I've had my eye on that mountain
[30:54] cuz remember Caleb tipes the Gentile do
[30:57] you know actually the word Caleb means
[31:00] dog the word Caleb means dog when Jesus
[31:03] was sitting there and that saraph
[31:04] phenician woman
[31:06] said Lord remember he said I not going
[31:09] to give this to the dogs what the
[31:12] Gentiles so we see Caleb means dog but
[31:16] that dog got a mountain yeah that dog
[31:19] got a mountain that dog didn't it wasn't
[31:22] left alone he got a mountain but look
[31:24] how beautiful upon the mountains are the
[31:26] feet of him that bringeth good tidings
[31:30] that publish peace that bringeth good
[31:32] tidings of good that publish salvation
[31:36] that saith unto Z thy God reth that's
[31:39] your part also it's not just Mountains
[31:41] for
[31:42] preachers it's Mountain for leoty this
[31:45] is your statue of a perfect man this is
[31:47] your
[31:49] inheritance you can either accept it or
[31:51] reject it the man that was in the prison
[31:55] he rejected it right right he rejected
[31:58] it so you have what I was trying to tell
[32:01] him brother Brown said the Holy Ghost
[32:03] was very timid a gentleman so he's not
[32:07] going to make you have these virtues
[32:09] you're not going to sit here and just
[32:10] say God you're going to have to give
[32:11] them to me now you know what happened
[32:13] Caleb said give me that mountain but if
[32:15] you'll keep reading the scripture Caleb
[32:17] had to
[32:18] fight the
[32:23] IES to get that mountain it wasn't a
[32:27] Cate walk he had to go and drive three
[32:29] different kind of people off that
[32:31] mountain but you know what he did it and
[32:34] he stayed on that mountain cuz you know
[32:36] what that's what he wanted and you know
[32:39] what God Said God said because Caleb
[32:43] holy w h o l l y
[32:47] holy didn't miss a virtue amen holy
[32:50] followed me I'll give him what he wants
[32:53] that's what our problem is why we not
[32:54] getting what we want because we don't
[32:55] wholly possess a mountain w h o l l y
[32:58] the whole Mountain all right it is a
[33:02] Holy
[33:03] Mountain but we got to possess it thy
[33:06] Watchmen shall lift up the voice with
[33:08] the voice together shall they sing for
[33:11] they shall see eye to eye
[33:16] right that's kind of hard for preachers
[33:18] to
[33:21] do well you
[33:24] know I've heard it said that you know we
[33:27] never come to a conclusion at the
[33:29] ministers meeting I I think the Bible
[33:32] says pretty plain we supposed to see eye
[33:33] to eye and that's not one eye this way
[33:36] and one out of that way or one going in
[33:37] this direction or crossed we've seen a
[33:39] few
[33:41] crossed but for they shall see eye to
[33:45] eye what when the Lord shall bring again
[33:48] Zion which is who the bride when he
[33:50] shall bring us in we will see this right
[33:55] of redemption it's a challenge how
[33:58] beautiful on the mountain are the
[34:01] feet we're going to read a quote in just
[34:03] a few minutes where brother Brown says
[34:05] Footprints means possession you can't
[34:08] just say Caleb just didn't say give me
[34:11] that mountain and he went to
[34:14] Florida that's just an area you know he
[34:17] didn't say give me my mountain and go to
[34:20] Egypt he went and got the mountain okay
[34:23] so that's what you that's my challenge
[34:25] to all of us that mountain is ours and
[34:29] we're letting it sit there empty or
[34:31] we're letting it sit there with all
[34:32] these IES in
[34:34] it I ain't going to do
[34:39] this told him last
[34:42] Sunday the Bible said I'll give you a
[34:44] new heart and it'll be a heart of
[34:48] Flesh I'll take out the Stony heart
[34:51] because you can't use a Stony heart a
[34:54] Stony heart is not pliable right a Stony
[34:57] heart if you put a heart in you that's
[34:58] made with stone you'll die but you put
[35:01] in a heart of Flesh that's what it's
[35:03] supposed to be something that's pliable
[35:05] something that God can work with all
[35:07] right and that's my goal is to get some
[35:09] you know hate me if you want to I don't
[35:11] care I'm like the old man I'm after your
[35:14] soul right and if you think you're
[35:16] something and you're not somebody ought
[35:18] to tell
[35:19] you may just be me Romans
[35:24] 10:14 cuz watch now Paul is going to
[35:27] remember Paul gets everything from the
[35:28] Old Testament right right exactly Paul
[35:32] goes and studies the Old Testament gets
[35:34] gleans out of the Old Testament and
[35:36] writes the New Testament okay so now
[35:38] Romans 10:14 how then shall they call on
[35:41] him in whom they have not
[35:45] believed and how shall they believe in
[35:47] him of whom they have not heard right
[35:51] and how shall they hear without a
[35:55] preacher and how shall they preach
[35:57] preach except they be sent he continues
[36:00] on here amen as it is written how
[36:02] beautiful are the feet of them that
[36:05] preach the gospel of peace Paul goes
[36:07] right back to the book of Isaiah we just
[36:09] read how beautiful are the feet of them
[36:12] that preach the gospel of peace and
[36:14] bring Glad Tidings of good things so we
[36:17] come and we see that
[36:19] Paul has brought us
[36:24] away pastors right apostles prophets
[36:28] pastors teachers evangelists that's the
[36:30] only way you're going to get
[36:32] perfected not this is not one man show
[36:35] right you're going to get perfected by
[36:37] five folds all right and those five
[36:40] folds if they're true they will help you
[36:43] if not they're going to be just like
[36:44] that was over there where it says my
[36:46] pastors many pastors have destroyed my
[36:49] Vineyard they have trotten my portion
[36:52] underfoot in other words under the wrong
[36:54] foot
[36:58] not going to say anymore we may speak on
[36:59] that later on let's go to Matthew and
[37:02] let's see how let's see
[37:05] how bad it is to turn a preacher
[37:09] down now I've heard many of
[37:12] you I sorry we're going to get personal
[37:15] tonight I've heard many of you say oh
[37:17] that was just brother
[37:18] Wade you know you could be blasphemed in
[37:21] the Holy
[37:23] Ghost you know if a deacon tells you
[37:25] something you say well I'm going to go
[37:26] do this just get get the deacons off my
[37:28] back you know that's almost blaspheming
[37:29] the Holy Ghost could be cuz what is
[37:32] blaspheming the Holy
[37:34] Ghost contributing something to be of
[37:38] the devil when it's of God is that
[37:45] right y'all about as quiet as that
[37:47] Baptist Church the other
[37:49] night but think about
[37:52] it if somebody tells you and it's in the
[37:55] word of God I don't care if he's mad or
[37:56] not but if he tells you the word of God
[37:58] and you're doing it wrong and you won't
[38:00] take correction and you say oh that's
[38:02] just brother so and
[38:10] so how many times have we said
[38:14] that I've heard some of you say I'm
[38:16] going going to do this just to get the
[38:17] deacons off my back that's almost
[38:20] blaspheming the Holy Ghost you say I
[38:23] can't do that you ain't born again you
[38:25] can and if you're not born that's
[38:27] probably why why you saying it cuz
[38:28] you're not born again let's just be
[38:30] honest let's just be honest with each
[38:33] other now
[38:35] look and if the house be
[38:38] worthy now what happens let's back up
[38:41] what happens is Jesus has got his
[38:42] disciples right he's going to take them
[38:44] two by two and send them out into the
[38:47] into the community okay all right let's
[38:49] set a stage here he's going to send them
[38:51] out into the community look how serious
[38:53] this is now God sends these people now
[38:56] they don't have the Holy Ghost yet but
[38:59] they're preaching what God tells them to
[39:01] preach because the Holy Ghost has not
[39:03] come but watch he sends them out two by
[39:06] two he says if the house be worthy let
[39:09] your peace come upon it if your look at
[39:12] me house he ain't talking about bricks
[39:14] and Stone House if your house be
[39:18] worthy if the house be worthy let your
[39:21] peace come upon it but if it be not
[39:23] worthy let your peace return to you and
[39:27] whosoever shall not receive
[39:30] you look how serious this is nor hear
[39:33] your words when you depart out of that
[39:36] house or city shake off the dust of your
[39:41] feet they have stopped the right of
[39:46] redemption amen if we're talking about
[39:49] feet means Redemption right why did
[39:51] Jesus say why' he say something about
[39:54] feet why is feet always coming up here
[39:57] whosoever shall not receive you nor hear
[39:59] your word when ye depart out of that
[40:01] house or city or
[40:04] church shake off the dust of your
[40:07] feet verily I say unto you it shall be
[40:10] more
[40:13] tolerable I'm not saying this this is a
[40:15] actually this is red letter Jesus is
[40:17] saying
[40:18] this it shall be more tolerable for the
[40:22] land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
[40:24] judgment than for that person right or
[40:27] that
[40:29] City whosoever shall not receive you nor
[40:32] hear your words when you depart shake
[40:36] off the dust of your feet because you
[40:37] they turn the right of redemption down
[40:39] you turn the right of redemption down
[40:41] there's nothing left but destruction all
[40:43] right pretty serious business but you
[40:46] turn down What God Says and look what
[40:48] happens right okay
[40:52] now talking about
[40:55] Redemption what happened in the book
[40:57] Book of Daniel just for a little thought
[40:59] here cuz I've only got a few more
[41:02] left that I want to use tonight I may
[41:04] want to continue with part two later on
[41:07] but in the Book of Daniel where does the
[41:11] image get
[41:15] struck not in the
[41:19] head from
[41:22] what the stone right not made by hands
[41:27] amen which was who Jesus Christ to do
[41:30] the right of redemption he goes right to
[41:32] the feet and he
[41:35] destroys that Kingdom that turns him
[41:38] down that image cuz you make an image
[41:40] other than God and you you've turned God
[41:42] down all right listen let's read Daniel
[41:45] now Daniel 2 and verse
[41:47] 33 through 35 his legs of iron his feet
[41:51] part of iron and part of clay now look
[41:53] how weak that foot is
[41:58] right if that foot would have been all
[42:01] Iron been hard to bust if it would have
[42:04] been all
[42:05] gold but remember man puts the finery up
[42:08] here gold was the head right and then it
[42:11] goes down brass and all that when you
[42:13] get down to the feet it's so weak iron
[42:15] and Clay don't even you can't even put
[42:17] it together hardly
[42:19] right so the feet of the enemy is so
[42:22] weak that stone is going to come and
[42:25] watch what happens that thou sawest till
[42:28] that a stone was cut out without hands
[42:31] which smoke the image upon his
[42:35] feet Christ coming doing the right of
[42:38] redemption strikes Satan watch that were
[42:43] of iron and clay and break them to
[42:45] Pieces didn't just break them to Pieces
[42:47] brother Chris didn't just leave them on
[42:48] the side of the road watch what happened
[42:50] then was the iron the clay he took the
[42:53] whole
[42:53] image cuz when he struck it in the feet
[42:56] it fell
[42:57] right all
[42:59] right he didn't just take the iron and
[43:01] Clay the brass the silver and the gold
[43:03] broke into pieces together and became
[43:05] like the chaff of the summer threshing
[43:08] floor he ground that image so into the
[43:12] ground till it was just like sand
[43:14] probably was less than sand and that's
[43:16] what he's going to do to the devil but
[43:20] look the wind carried them away that no
[43:22] place was found for them right Naomi had
[43:27] had to have had a piece of
[43:32] land she had to have a piece of land
[43:35] before Boaz could redeem it right amen
[43:38] she possessed that property but she lost
[43:44] it she lost
[43:46] it but Boaz come to redeem it back
[43:51] right now let's go well let's read the
[43:54] rest of this and the wind carried them
[43:55] away that no place was found for them
[43:58] and the SM stone that smoked the image
[44:00] became a what amen we go right back to a
[44:03] mountain again it's like I told him
[44:05] before did you ever think of this when I
[44:06] was preaching that the other day on on
[44:09] um what was I preaching on the other day
[44:12] J
[44:13] um but anyway oh glorify it
[44:17] again Jesus started on a river and ended
[44:20] on a
[44:21] mountain your experience starts at a
[44:24] river and ends at a mountain amen
[44:28] you do the same thing Jesus did when he
[44:29] was on the River Jordan he said this is
[44:32] my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to
[44:34] dwell and he goes to a mountain at the
[44:36] end of his journey and God makes him
[44:39] before man he says you're going to hear
[44:41] this guy right here right why because he
[44:43] was obedient his walk was obedient if
[44:48] you're
[44:49] disobedient
[44:51] remember probably not a son but now
[44:54] let's go to Zechariah 14 and this is is
[44:57] where he's going to
[44:59] stand then we're going to read a couple
[45:01] of quotes I think here in just a minute
[45:02] that brother brandham talks about here
[45:04] but Zechariah
[45:05] 144 and his feet shall stand in that day
[45:09] upon the Mount of Olives this is when
[45:11] it's done for us
[45:14] remember all right which is before
[45:16] Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of
[45:18] Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof
[45:21] toward the East and toward the west and
[45:23] there shall be a very great valley and
[45:25] half of the mountain shall remove toward
[45:27] the North and half of it toward the
[45:29] South that's when Jesus is coming back
[45:31] Zechariah showing that his feet shall
[45:34] stand where upon the Earth the only way
[45:36] Jesus's feet is going to be on the earth
[45:39] at that time is is the right of
[45:41] redemption has been claimed in a group
[45:42] of
[45:44] people one more time amen one more time
[45:49] right the only reason he's standing in
[45:52] on the earth at that moment of time is
[45:55] that somebody has come to full
[45:58] Redemption somebody has let
[46:02] Boaz right remember Ruth didn't have
[46:05] anything to do right amen she let Boaz
[46:08] do the work for him like brother Dale
[46:10] said that's what kind of struck this
[46:11] with me the other day when he said when
[46:13] he gave the quote where said God let it
[46:15] die yeah you know what if you kill
[46:17] somebody You're a murderer
[46:20] right but God says I put in Kings and
[46:23] take out Kings All Souls are mine he
[46:26] said don't he said don't worry about the
[46:27] one that can kill the body he should
[46:29] worry about the one that can kill the
[46:30] soul God's the only one that can make
[46:32] one and take one away so we have to let
[46:34] God kill that thing we have to let God
[46:36] let it die as the prophet said all right
[46:39] if God lets it die the the old man ain't
[46:41] going to resurrect no more all right so
[46:44] his feet shall stand that day on the
[46:45] Mount of Olives now watch let's go back
[46:48] to Deuteronomy and let's look at
[46:50] possession because what's going to
[46:52] happen here in the book of Deuteronomy
[46:55] we're going to go back to the walk
[46:57] because your walk is going to
[47:00] determine what you
[47:04] get one more time your walk is going to
[47:08] determine what you get all right now
[47:12] what's he talking he's talking to who
[47:15] Moses right he's talking to Moses here
[47:17] in Deuteronomy all right then will the
[47:19] Lord drive out all these nations from
[47:21] before you and you shall possess greater
[47:24] Nations and mightier than
[47:27] yourself every place where on the souls
[47:30] of your feet shall tread shall be yours
[47:34] right from the Wilderness and Lebanon
[47:37] from the river the river Euphrates even
[47:39] un the uttermost sea shall your Coast be
[47:42] so everywhere they went that was a
[47:45] possession there shall no man be able to
[47:48] stand before you
[47:52] stand right
[47:54] feet right but it's the other guy's feet
[47:57] yeah no man will be able to stand before
[48:01] you why you going to knock them all down
[48:03] for the Lord your God shall lay the fear
[48:05] of
[48:07] you and the dread of
[48:11] you if you have these virtues in
[48:15] place can I read the love letter is that
[48:17] okay brother Dean can I read the love
[48:18] letter I know you love to do that read
[48:21] that love letter God's talking to us
[48:23] right that's the Love Letter sure it's
[48:26] Israel and sure it's Moses but let's
[48:29] take it out of the Old Testament and put
[48:31] it right here tonight amen God shall lay
[48:34] the fear of you and the dread of you
[48:36] upon all the land that ye shall
[48:40] tread walk upon as he hath said unto
[48:45] you but your walk being
[48:49] something cuz put up
[48:51] 15a and let's read this one I didn't
[48:54] have this one in CU it it kind of says a
[48:57] little bit different but go back to 15a
[48:59] I think I missed that one but that look
[49:00] watch in Psalms 37 now brother brandom
[49:03] quotes this scripture and he don't
[49:05] quoted anything close to
[49:08] that brother brandom quotes the
[49:10] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[49:12] of the
[49:12] Lord now that's not exactly what that
[49:15] says but that's exactly what that says
[49:17] right because you pull up the quote
[49:20] footsteps of the righteous you hear
[49:21] Brother Ram quoted about 80 something
[49:23] times in the sermon well there's no
[49:25] scripture that says to the footsteps of
[49:27] the
[49:28] righteous are ordered of the Lord but I
[49:31] looked up ordered by the or ordered of
[49:34] the Lord and I just put ordered in and
[49:36] this is what comes up and that's the
[49:37] only scripture he's talking about but
[49:39] the steps of a good man
[49:43] right a good
[49:45] man see the problem
[49:50] is that good
[49:53] part the steps of a good man are ordered
[49:58] by the
[49:59] Lord and he
[50:01] delighteth in his
[50:04] way so now there shall no man be able to
[50:07] stand before
[50:10] you get the steps of a good man ordered
[50:14] by the Lord Glory all right now let's
[50:17] read this great warrior Joshua
[50:20] 1955
[50:23] 119 all right
[50:27] let's read on down where down here for
[50:29] the the dark part
[50:31] is he told
[50:33] Joshua he said as I was with Moses so I
[50:36] will be with thee only be good be good
[50:39] only be good courage
[50:40] courageous do not be discourage just
[50:43] keep moving on I'll be with you every
[50:46] place you set the souls of your
[50:48] feet is a possession for you right right
[50:54] Glory now look he didn't stop there
[50:56] Footprints means possession brother what
[50:59] the church needs tonight is some more
[51:02] Footprints over here on this
[51:05] land don't hang around Jordan too long
[51:10] let's get out of here and see what we
[51:12] got all right every time that he made a
[51:15] footprint every time he footprinted on
[51:19] it was a possession I can see Joshua
[51:22] after he had the vision he said now
[51:24] gather all Israel together I'll show you
[51:26] the glory of God is amen he had a vision
[51:29] God told him in his word Glory he's
[51:32] talking to us God told him in his word
[51:33] the word says I've give you the land
[51:36] it's yours it's your possession all
[51:40] right now sir we will see Jesus
[51:44] 1957 Brothers Footprints is possession
[51:48] ministering Brethren don't be afraid to
[51:50] put print Footprints where God has told
[51:54] you to go right
[51:57] not where Mama sent you or where you
[51:59] think you ought to go but where God
[52:02] Amen told you to go amen it's possession
[52:05] he told Joshua everywhere The Souls of
[52:07] your feet set that's yours amen we don't
[52:12] back up we take what God Said and that's
[52:15] the truth no matter what the opposition
[52:18] is how great it seems how difficult it
[52:20] seems if God said so it's yours when he
[52:24] gave it to Joshua he never said I'll
[52:25] take all the high fight and Philistines
[52:27] and give it to you Joshua had to fight
[52:31] for every inch of
[52:33] ground but God was with
[52:35] him and every inch of ground you'll
[52:38] cover brother to make Footprints you'll
[52:41] fight your way through right but take
[52:44] the sword of the spirit brother and move
[52:46] right on
[52:48] Footprints is
[52:51] possession so what did he tell let's go
[52:54] back to the father of our faith let's go
[52:55] back to Abraham
[52:57] that's why Abraham was a Sojourner
[53:00] that's why Abraham went into Canaan he
[53:01] even went into Egypt he went he walked
[53:04] all over that property why Genesis
[53:08] 13:16 and I will make thy seed as the
[53:11] dust of the earth so that if a man can
[53:14] number the dust of the earth then shall
[53:15] thy seed also be numbered arise walk
[53:20] right
[53:23] Footprints walk through the land in the
[53:26] length of it and the breadth of it for I
[53:29] will give it unto thee amen all right
[53:33] you see where this is all coming to but
[53:34] now
[53:36] watch there's something that we do and
[53:39] we'll be finished in just a minute won't
[53:41] be long tonight just kind of wanted to
[53:42] give you a few scriptures tonight and
[53:43] then maybe we'll do something a little
[53:45] bit later on for more on Footprints and
[53:48] possession but let's turn to John
[53:51] 134 you ever wonder why Jesus
[53:54] instituted footwash
[53:59] question oh because they had Dirty Feet
[54:04] no you ever really listen to what it
[54:07] says or is it just become a ritual that
[54:10] we do at the end of the
[54:12] communion if Footprints means
[54:15] possession and feet has a part of
[54:19] redemption let's read and see what he
[54:21] says he rises from sumper and laid aside
[54:24] His Garment and took a towel and GED him
[54:26] self and after that he pth water into a
[54:29] bason and began to wash the disciples
[54:31] feet and to wipe them with a towel where
[54:33] with he was girded then cometh he to
[54:35] Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord
[54:37] Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered
[54:40] and said unto him what I
[54:43] do thou knowest not
[54:46] now but Thou shalt
[54:49] know here after in other words when he
[54:52] the Holy Ghost has come he'll tell you
[54:55] why when you you're washing the
[54:56] brother's feet you're showing the right
[54:59] of redemption amen
[55:02] listen what I do thou knowest not now
[55:05] but Thou shalt know
[55:07] Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt
[55:09] never wash my
[55:11] feet watch what Jesus said Jesus
[55:14] answered him if I wash thee
[55:20] not don't tell me that's not
[55:23] important I know a lot of you don't take
[55:25] communion but don't take footb foot
[55:27] washing you're losing your right of
[55:29] redemption
[55:30] right sorry guys he don't Institute this
[55:33] and then you you can do it if you want
[55:35] to now if you got a problem with your
[55:37] feet that's okay you need to tell
[55:39] somebody though but if you take
[55:42] communion I wouldn't take communion if I
[55:44] didn't foot wash knowing now what I know
[55:46] about this right here about this foot
[55:48] washing showing the right of redemption
[55:50] that Jesus is saying what I do thou
[55:52] knowest not now but you'll know
[55:54] Hereafter if I wash thee not thou Hast
[55:57] no part with me amen now I didn't say
[56:01] that it's not a rule that I put in the
[56:04] book Jesus said if I don't wash your
[56:06] feet you have no part with me in other
[56:08] words what the right of
[56:10] redemption if you
[56:13] refuse you refuse that part of
[56:16] redemption hey that's Jesus left us
[56:19] three things to
[56:20] do right communion water baptism washing
[56:25] feet that's all not a list of 80 or 70
[56:28] or 50 three three things to
[56:32] do and he said if I wash thee not thou
[56:35] Hast no
[56:37] part with me now Simon Peter was a
[56:40] pretty dumb guy as far as ignorant and
[56:43] unlearned but he was smart when it come
[56:46] to
[56:48] this right Simon Peter said' Lord not my
[56:51] feet only but also my hands and my and
[56:54] my head but now remember the hands and
[56:57] the head ain't got anything to do with
[56:58] the right of redemption Jesus was
[57:00] showing them the right of redemption
[57:02] he's coming to redeem
[57:05] them
[57:06] body because he didn't wash their
[57:08] theophany right he washed their feet
[57:12] they were human feet and those same feet
[57:16] that Peter he washed Peter's feet the
[57:18] same reason that Peter let him do it and
[57:21] got a revelation of it the same reason
[57:23] that Peter's going to stand back on this
[57:24] Earth again cuz he's going to accept the
[57:27] right of redemption right all right same
[57:29] way with you and I all right if I wash
[57:31] thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon
[57:35] Peter said unto him Lord not my feet
[57:37] only but also my hands and my head Jesus
[57:40] said to him he that is washed he's
[57:43] talking about natural he that is washed
[57:45] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[57:48] is clean ever with but ye are not all
[57:50] clean for he knew who should betray him
[57:52] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[57:55] you know I was brother Claud and I were
[57:57] talking about something the other day
[57:57] and he said you know what he said Jesus
[57:59] didn't refuse Judas in
[58:02] anything let him take communion even let
[58:05] him take foot washing but you know what
[58:06] that was his
[58:08] condemnation cuz when he finished
[58:10] washing judas's
[58:11] feet Judas
[58:13] left he stayed until he come to that
[58:17] right of redemption Jesus washed his
[58:19] feet as a symbol but he turned it down
[58:22] he went out he didn't stay with him he
[58:24] went out so after he had washed their
[58:26] feet and had taken His Garment and was
[58:28] set down he said unto them know
[58:32] ye what I have done to
[58:35] you you call me master and Lord and you
[58:38] say well for so I am if then your Lord
[58:42] and Master have washed your feet you
[58:44] also ought to wash one another's feet
[58:48] right for I have given you an
[58:51] example an
[58:53] example that you should do as I have
[58:56] have done to you verily verily I say
[58:59] unto you the servant is not greater than
[59:01] his Lord neither he that is sent greater
[59:04] than he that sent him if you know these
[59:06] things happy are ye if you do them for
[59:10] I've given you an example that you
[59:12] should do as I have done to you the very
[59:15] thing that we walk on this Earth with
[59:18] called
[59:19] feet everywhere you
[59:23] go you're possession the land amen
[59:27] Footprints means possession right
[59:31] now apply that to your children apply
[59:34] that to your home right apply that to
[59:36] your car apply that to your
[59:39] job I think the problem is is we just
[59:42] don't
[59:44] believe we don't believe if you're born
[59:47] again those feet you're walking on Are
[59:50] Holy
[59:53] feet but I now the Lord never said but
[59:58] I the Lord told Moses go in and possess
[1:00:01] the told Joshua go in and possess the
[1:00:03] land wherever The Souls of your feet
[1:00:05] stand I'll give it to you so you know
[1:00:08] what if Joshua walked out to the east
[1:00:11] God give him everything to the East and
[1:00:13] then God has give us the Holy Ghost now
[1:00:16] Joshua and a type of the Holy Ghost and
[1:00:19] not just to guide us outside but
[1:00:22] inside brother Brown said these are God
[1:00:25] these are God's hand
[1:00:27] right so these are God's feet but
[1:00:30] remember where you
[1:00:33] walk I like what Claud says if you live
[1:00:36] a hound dog life that means you're a
[1:00:37] hound
[1:00:40] dog and the seal show on the back side
[1:00:43] and the front side that means coming and
[1:00:45] going out there and out here right how
[1:00:49] many of us I want I'd like for Daddy to
[1:00:51] ride with us sometime just to just to
[1:00:54] kind of enjoy um me and Jacob kidding
[1:00:57] each other a lot but and talking about
[1:00:59] his daddy but

[1:01:41] your
[1:01:43] father
[1:01:45] right cuz you're walking brother BR said
[1:01:48] you're a walking living breathing
[1:01:50] instrumentality of God I read that to
[1:01:51] the people in Oklahoma and then I also
[1:01:54] read the one in invisible Union where
[1:01:57] you The
[1:01:58] Virtuous
[1:02:01] sinless bride of Jesus Christ that's
[1:02:04] what he said that's what he
[1:02:07] said but you got to come under that
[1:02:10] Jesus has got to wash your feet and then
[1:02:13] you got to wash the others feet that was
[1:02:14] judas's problem Judas never made it to
[1:02:17] another foot
[1:02:20] washing I didn't finish my
[1:02:22] story Judas didn't make it to another
[1:02:24] foot washing
[1:02:26] he hung himself but the disciples after
[1:02:30] Jesus came back and the baptism of the
[1:02:33] Holy Ghost they continued to wash feet
[1:02:36] they would gather together they would
[1:02:38] wash feet why they was doing exactly
[1:02:40] what Jesus said wash wash the disciples
[1:02:43] feet wash the feet of
[1:02:45] the ones that possess the
[1:02:49] land but you and I have a
[1:02:52] possession right and it's not
[1:02:54] in cars and homes and all that's fine
[1:02:58] but it's in you it's in
[1:03:01] flesh that's why this how beautiful are
[1:03:05] the feet now God said that how beautiful
[1:03:08] are the feet of them that carry the
[1:03:10] gospel not just a preacher you're
[1:03:13] supposed to carry the
[1:03:16] gospel it's not just our it's not the
[1:03:18] burden is not all on us it say study to
[1:03:20] show yourself approved don't study to
[1:03:21] show your pastor
[1:03:22] approved right study to show yourself
[1:03:25] approved right a Workman what does a
[1:03:28] Workman do sit
[1:03:29] down no he works he's on his feet he's
[1:03:34] walking he's possessing the land that's
[1:03:37] our problem people we need to start
[1:03:40] putting our feet to the neck of that
[1:03:44] enemy ain't that what David said Joshua
[1:03:47] said and then David did it with with
[1:03:49] Goliath but Joshua said hey you come in
[1:03:52] here you put your feet on those kings
[1:03:54] you know there was a man named Samuel
[1:03:56] one time let's stand there was a man
[1:03:57] named Samuel not going to be here long
[1:03:58] tonight I just want to let you just
[1:04:01] every time you read the Bible now you're
[1:04:02] going to look at feet and foot foot
[1:04:04] stool Footprints walk heal uh all kind
[1:04:08] of things but remember there is your
[1:04:10] right of redemption so watch that and
[1:04:12] look for it in the
[1:04:14] scripture but you
[1:04:17] know how beautiful are the
[1:04:23] feet God said beautiful right are the
[1:04:27] feet of them that bring great Tidings
[1:04:30] amen of Joy to the people we you know we
[1:04:33] need missionaries and we need things
[1:04:35] like that but Claud and I were talking
[1:04:36] the other day you know brother Bram said
[1:04:39] first and foremost that the United
[1:04:42] States of
[1:04:43] America is where we need to be
[1:04:45] missionary first right first and
[1:04:48] foremost missionary here have you talked
[1:04:51] to your
[1:04:53] neighbor or does you life speak louder
[1:04:57] than your
[1:04:58] testimony and it drowns out your
[1:05:01] neighbor's thoughts of you daddy said
[1:05:03] many times and I don't y'all don't
[1:05:06] listen I don't either sometimes he says
[1:05:10] maybe your kids don't want this because
[1:05:11] they don't see it in you well who's he
[1:05:13] talking to that church over under who's
[1:05:15] he talking about who's he talking to me
[1:05:17] too brother but we just don't admit it
[1:05:20] our problem is repent that's our whole
[1:05:24] problem we say sorry Lord no the Bible
[1:05:27] says Godly sorrow leadeth you to
[1:05:29] repentance you got to be sorrow for for
[1:05:31] what you're doing then repent and then
[1:05:35] God said he'd do what he'd do there's a
[1:05:37] step in a process for all this but
[1:05:39] remember feet everywhere you go
[1:05:42] everywhere the soul of your feet and you
[1:05:44] know what my kids's
[1:05:46] feet are
[1:05:48] mine right they come from me my kids's
[1:05:53] feet are
[1:05:54] mine that's where they come from they
[1:05:56] come from me same way with yours your
[1:05:59] kids didn't come from somebody else they
[1:06:00] came from your
[1:06:02] feet Footprints means possession right
[1:06:06] so walk everywhere you walk make
[1:06:10] sure that your testimony
[1:06:12] fits with your walk let's bow our heads
[1:06:16] then we'll sing a
[1:06:17] song dear heavenly father we pray that
[1:06:19] what we've said tonight would go to the
[1:06:23] heart of the people and they would see
[1:06:25] Lord that
[1:06:26] we have a lot of work to do we see the
[1:06:29] apostles and see how they walked in
[1:06:32] there in the book of Acts and how the
[1:06:34] actions of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:06:37] Believers just makes us ashamed of
[1:06:39] oursel Lord but Lord if we could just
[1:06:42] see that it's not us doing it but Lord
[1:06:46] we do have to press into a
[1:06:48] place you said the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:06:51] taken by force so Lord let us Force our
[1:06:55] way
[1:06:56] take these feet that you've given us
[1:06:58] Lord your feet Shaw with the preparation
[1:07:00] of the Gospel we didn't get to that one
[1:07:02] but Lord there's many others that will
[1:07:04] take at a later time if you'll permit
[1:07:06] Lord but our feet are shod with the
[1:07:09] preparation of the Gospel so we must
[1:07:11] prepare before we walk we must prepare
[1:07:15] before we fight cuz we can't fight this
[1:07:18] enemy by oursel we have to have a
[1:07:21] Joshua who will go out and possess every
[1:07:25] where the soul of his feet was you gave
[1:07:27] it to him and Lord I pray that you would
[1:07:30] take us as you took Gideon who was
[1:07:35] hiding behind a well and you look down
[1:07:38] at Gideon said Gideon thy Mighty Man of
[1:07:41] Valor he'd never fought a fight he was
[1:07:44] afraid of where he was he was afraid of
[1:07:47] the enemy he had let him beat him
[1:07:49] down but you said Gideon thy Mighty Man
[1:07:52] of Valor Lord you knew what he was made
[1:07:55] out of
[1:07:56] but he didn't but now we see that Gideon
[1:07:59] through a revelation saw that you were
[1:08:03] the one that was doing the work and that
[1:08:05] you were using that vessel Lord we pray
[1:08:07] that you'd use all these vessels but we
[1:08:10] must empty oursel up first so that you
[1:08:13] can
[1:08:14] possess this vessel father we ask that
[1:08:17] You' just be with us now in the rest of
[1:08:20] this service Lord May
[1:08:22] our thoughts and ideas
[1:08:26] be thrown out the window Lord and we'll
[1:08:28] have the mind of Christ and that that
[1:08:31] mind that's formed in US Lord will take
[1:08:33] out all that old man that old nature and
[1:08:36] kill that thing out Lord if we have a
[1:08:38] door as the prophet said IND doors IND
[1:08:41] doors we may have a door of Pride we may
[1:08:43] have a door of selfishness we may have a
[1:08:46] door of of being dilatory or or being
[1:08:49] slothful or or not be wanting to to do
[1:08:53] the things that we're supposed to do
[1:08:54] Lord may we open that door Lord you're a
[1:08:58] gentleman you won't come crashing
[1:08:59] through the door you'll ask if you can
[1:09:01] come in and we can tell you yes or no
[1:09:04] father we pray that we open all doors
[1:09:07] all of our life would be an open book to
[1:09:09] you father that we will truly Lord as we
[1:09:12] spoke last weekend on the book of books
[1:09:14] that we would absolutely be that book
[1:09:17] that people will be judged from that you
[1:09:20] Lord will be happy and pleased to dwell
[1:09:23] in this vessel Lord for those that do
[1:09:25] not have the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that
[1:09:27] you'd give it to them right now that
[1:09:29] they would not settle their self day or
[1:09:32] night that they wouldn't eat Lord just
[1:09:34] stir their water father go after our
[1:09:37] children go after our husbands and wives
[1:09:39] that are not here Lord go after brothers
[1:09:42] and sisters and the ones Lord that are
[1:09:44] downstairs on that list Lord we pray
[1:09:46] that you would just be with them that
[1:09:49] you would tug at their heart Lord and
[1:09:51] that they would accept you father the
[1:09:53] ones that have left the church Lord many
[1:09:55] many times we see them drifting back in
[1:09:57] and drifting back out Lord we pray that
[1:10:00] you would bring them in the F father
[1:10:02] it's getting late it's getting a time to
[1:10:04] where we don't need to be playing
[1:10:05] anymore Lord we need to show that when
[1:10:08] we wash our brother's feet we're not
[1:10:11] just washing just for some kind of a um
[1:10:15] a ritual but it's lord it's showing that
[1:10:18] you did the right of redemption in that
[1:10:20] person and that you're having that foot
[1:10:23] washing and communion to show Lord that
[1:10:27] you've cleansed Us by the washing of the
[1:10:29] water of the word that you've took all
[1:10:31] of our sin and our shame and put it on
[1:10:33] your back and went to Calvary with it
[1:10:35] Lord and they nailed those beautiful
[1:10:37] feet to the cross for my sins Lord and
[1:10:41] when you came up on Resurrection morning
[1:10:43] you didn't have sore feet but you still
[1:10:44] had those nail prints but Lord those
[1:10:47] feet possess the gates of the enemy and
[1:10:50] they tore hell they tore death and sent
[1:10:54] them back to where they supposed to be
[1:10:56] Lord we've got to understand that we've
[1:10:58] got to see that and it's got to start
[1:11:00] somewhere so Lord start it right here

[1:11:20] water to his mouth without saying Thank
[1:11:22] You
[1:11:23] Lord we thank you for all things father

[1:12:15] of the enemy Lord and take that sword of
[1:12:17] the word and cut him yes Lord and get

[1:19:40] with an ill
[1:19:42] report
[1:19:44] right they were preachers they were sent
[1:19:47] to do a job and come back and bring a
[1:19:49] report who has believed our report and
[1:19:52] who has the arm of the Lord been
[1:19:54] revealed well Joshua and Caleb they
[1:19:56] didn't
[1:19:57] see they didn't see all that how tall
[1:20:01] they were and how many they were
[1:20:04] and they said we can take the
[1:20:07] land just like
[1:20:09] Abraham Abraham how you going to have
[1:20:11] that
[1:20:12] baby he said I don't have a
[1:20:15] clue in other words what he was saying
[1:20:17] was it's not my job to do it God want it
[1:20:19] promised
[1:20:20] it that's what we got to look
[1:20:23] at you look look at the promise you
[1:20:25] forget about the
[1:20:27] journey you'll go crazy worrying about
[1:20:30] your kids and your wife and your people
[1:20:32] and you'll go crazy and that's what the
[1:20:35] devil wants you to do go crazy that's
[1:20:38] right Abraham didn't go
[1:20:42] crazy he was 99 years old he physically
[1:20:45] knew in his body he could not do
[1:20:50] that but yet he sat down I believe every
[1:20:53] night and said
[1:20:55] God you
[1:20:57] promised God you promised I'd have a
[1:21:01] child and I believe he just looked at
[1:21:03] God and said you're the only one that
[1:21:05] can do
[1:21:06] it you're the only one that can perform
[1:21:09] it now how we going to change our body
[1:21:13] somebody tell me somebody give me a
[1:21:16] formula tell me what somebody just kind
[1:21:18] of figured out go Google it Google
[1:21:22] change of the
[1:21:23] body take something yeah exactly you
[1:21:26] can't do it by I always thought you had
[1:21:28] to be strong and you know great big
[1:21:29] muscles and all
[1:21:31] this Jesus said what man can add one
[1:21:35] inch to his
[1:21:37] stature but God told us
[1:21:40] promises and if Footprints means
[1:21:44] possession you walk in front of your
[1:21:47] kids you walk in front of your wife or
[1:21:50] your or your spouse that's not here and
[1:21:52] that's all you can do but now you make
[1:21:55] sure it reflects with this if it don't
[1:21:57] reflect with this that's probably the
[1:21:59] reason that why they're not
[1:22:04] here here's the mirror right look in
[1:22:07] this
[1:22:08] mirror this mirror right here tell you
[1:22:10] how to act right you look in a regular
[1:22:14] mirror see Abraham looked in a regular
[1:22:16] mirror and he knew he couldn't
[1:22:19] perform Hey listen Abraham knew what it
[1:22:22] took to have a kid he wasn't a dummy he
[1:22:24] was not 99 years old and been living
[1:22:25] with Sarah since she was
[1:22:27] 16 so he knew all the
[1:22:33] mechanics we sometimes know all the
[1:22:37] mechanics but where's the Dynamics one
[1:22:40] day the Dynamics came and changed
[1:22:42] Abraham's body cuz there's no way
[1:22:45] Abraham could do that so let's don't sit
[1:22:49] here and try to figure out how this
[1:22:51] thing's going to end let's don't figure
[1:22:53] out try to figure out this and that and
[1:22:56] the other well brother brandham what's
[1:23:00] this change of the body or this
[1:23:02] translation he said just a
[1:23:05] change he never expounded much more on
[1:23:08] it he say just a change you know why cuz
[1:23:11] it wasn't for him to figure out
[1:23:13] right it wasn't for him to figure it out
[1:23:16] it ain't for us to figure out we set
[1:23:18] down and figure out try to figure out
[1:23:20] what God
[1:23:22] wants this is what he wants he got say
[1:23:24] no more this is it right here the mirror
[1:23:28] the reflection look in and
[1:23:30] see but Footprints means
[1:23:34] possession how beautiful are the feet
[1:23:37] that's what God said about you when he
[1:23:38] come to the River Jordan and he said
[1:23:40] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:23:41] pleased to dwell God was pleased to
[1:23:42] dwell in that vessel
[1:23:45] right no other stipulation sure he had
[1:23:49] flesh he probably needed a bath
[1:23:54] but God was pleased to dwell in that
[1:23:56] vessel and he took that vessel and it
[1:23:59] died for me and
[1:24:00] you those precious beautiful feet do you
[1:24:04] know we're going to walk on streets of
[1:24:06] gold with feet with no
[1:24:09] scars and it's going to feel just like
[1:24:11] good soft
[1:24:13] grass man I love to walk on Daddy's
[1:24:16] yard I take my shoes off and just walk
[1:24:19] cuz it's just be but now what about 10
[1:24:20] million times more than that over there
[1:24:23] cuz you might step in something his in
[1:24:25] his yard Thorns or briers or I'm talking
[1:24:27] about thorns and briers y'all quit
[1:24:29] talking about other stuff thorns and
[1:24:30] briers and rocks but over there it's
[1:24:32] just streets to go but you know what
[1:24:34] when Jesus walks up you're going to look
[1:24:36] down at those feet and they're going to
[1:24:39] be the most beautiful feet in the world
[1:24:41] and they going to have
[1:24:43] holes down through the top of
[1:24:46] them for me and you brother
[1:24:49] Ry for an eternity he's going to have a
[1:24:51] body that's going to walk on those feet
[1:24:55] because he possessed you you were lost
[1:24:59] you were doomed and on your way to hell
[1:25:02] and he came and died we're going to get
[1:25:05] back one day to start believing that
[1:25:06] Jesus Christ died for us and then we'll
[1:25:08] start worrying about what the message
[1:25:10] said okay let's get let's get them let's
[1:25:13] get them to Christ the prophet said and
[1:25:15] I'll promise you you get them to Christ
[1:25:17] they'll come to the
[1:25:18] message I promise you you get them to
[1:25:21] Christ get them to Christ they'll come
[1:25:22] to the message but you got to you you
[1:25:24] know you know what they're watching your
[1:25:26] feet right everywhere you go they're
[1:25:30] watching somebody's watching you know
[1:25:32] they got cameras everywhere Now
[1:25:34] everywhere even where you don't even
[1:25:36] think there's cameras we were doing a
[1:25:39] house today and Jacob said look up and I
[1:25:41] looked up in a tree and there was a
[1:25:44] camera never seen it before it's a
[1:25:46] camera sticking up in a tree
[1:25:48] surveillance camera but you know what
[1:25:51] God's watching you but people around you
[1:25:53] are watching in you too
[1:25:56] amen whether you realize it or not
[1:25:59] they're watching and you know what God
[1:26:02] said he's going to possess this land and
[1:26:04] I'm talking about this land this land
[1:26:06] right here by the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:08] Ghost he has
[1:26:10] possessed the gates of the enemy I
[1:26:13] remember Brother Dean lik to uh really
[1:26:15] likes to preach on possessing the gates
[1:26:16] of the enemy CU you know what it is this
[1:26:18] is the
[1:26:19] enemies this right here is the enemies
[1:26:22] it was born in sin shapen in iniquity
[1:26:24] spouse of Mother's wom a liar doomed and
[1:26:27] on his way to
[1:26:28] hell but Jesus Christ possessed this
[1:26:31] right
[1:26:33] here you'll think about foot washing a
[1:26:35] little bit different I hope even you
[1:26:36] sisters also you'll think about foot
[1:26:38] washing cuz you're washing the feet
[1:26:41] showing that the right of redemption has
[1:26:43] been
[1:26:44] fulfilled eat my flesh drink my blood
[1:26:48] wash your
[1:26:50] feet that's what he said to do till he
[1:26:52] come right so maybe maybe we'll
[1:26:54] understand it a little bit more when we
[1:26:55] wash our brother's feet are you washing
[1:26:58] your sister's feet you're washing their
[1:27:00] feet showing hey you can be redeemed
[1:27:04] this is the right of redemption cuz
[1:27:06] Jesus said you'll understand it let me
[1:27:09] paraphrase he said you'll understand it
[1:27:10] when I come back you're not going to
[1:27:11] understand it now right but you'll
[1:27:13] understand it so I believe the first
[1:27:14] time they took foot washing after they
[1:27:16] received the Holy Ghost I believe they
[1:27:18] had a good time they probably didn't
[1:27:20] stay sit down long they probably them
[1:27:23] feet was up jumping aisles and all these
[1:27:25] other things cuz they had realized what
[1:27:26] Jesus was trying to tell them I am doing
[1:27:29] the right of redemption and now I'm
[1:27:31] telling you to go do the same thing
[1:27:33] right the same thing not something
[1:27:36] different the only way people are going
[1:27:38] to be redeemed on this Earth is to hear
[1:27:39] the gospel through
[1:27:41] us and I don't mean us I mean the bride
[1:27:45] right that's the right of redemption how
[1:27:48] beautiful are the feet let's bow our
[1:27:50] heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord
[1:27:52] that you'd give us a safe trip back home
[1:27:55] Lord that you forgive us of our sins
[1:27:57] Lord and our many mistakes that we make
[1:27:59] Lord we look to Calvary Lord we look to
[1:28:03] the blood and you hear our Voice through
[1:28:05] the blood and you don't see all the
[1:28:07] little stupid things that we do Lord but
[1:28:10] I pray Lord that as we walk in our daily
[1:28:13] life that you would be the total
[1:28:16] possessor of these
[1:28:17] vessels that you would show people
[1:28:20] through our lives that they can be
[1:28:23] redeemed
[1:28:24] and we look to you at Calvary Lord
[1:28:26] knowing that you did that right but you
[1:28:28] came back on the day of Pentecost to
[1:28:29] give the right back to your people cuz
[1:28:33] you want a group of people to be
[1:28:35] redeemed and you'll have a group of
[1:28:37] people because you said so you said that
[1:28:41] we would possess the gates of the enemy
[1:28:44] and we only have one enemy and that's
[1:28:47] Satan and he is death and that one enemy
[1:28:51] you put under your feet so said in the
[1:28:54] scripture that heaven is my throne and
[1:28:56] Earth is my foot stol and where can I
[1:29:01] reside Lord reside in these vessels that
[1:29:04] we have here in front of you tonight and
[1:29:06] I pray that you would just be with each
[1:29:08] one give us a good week as we come
[1:29:11] together on Saturday for the Bible study
[1:29:14] that you'll just give us Lord a
[1:29:15] refilling of the Holy Spirit Lord that
[1:29:18] you would just rejuvenate us and and
[1:29:20] teach us to as we do things in life and
[1:29:22] as we walk in life that that somebody is
[1:29:25] watching somebody's watching when we're

[1:29:53] still have have that old Spirit realm of
[1:29:55] memories and conscious affection
[1:29:56] imagination that Satan plays with but
[1:30:00] Lord let us believe tonight that you
[1:30:03] have possessed all things that means the
[1:30:07] body that means the spirit and that
[1:30:09] means the soul no man has stood on this
[1:30:12] Earth and truly believe that yet but you
[1:30:15] promised there'd be a group of people
[1:30:17] that would stand Body Spirit and soul
[1:30:19] and say I am redeemed yes Lord amen
