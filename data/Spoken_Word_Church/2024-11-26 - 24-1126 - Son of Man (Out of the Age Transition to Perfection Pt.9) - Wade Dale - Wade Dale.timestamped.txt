[7:27] way Hallelujah
[7:30] amen he truly is the way the truth and
[7:34] the life uh sister Rebecca you have a
[7:37] testimony you like to come give we're
[7:38] going to ask her to come at this time
[7:40] and give it to her
[8:01] enough y'all probably can hear me anyway
[8:03] um I just want to give two quick
[8:05] testimonies um just to reflect and just
[8:08] thank the Lord and um uh I think he
[8:10] comes in when I'm weak that's when I see
[8:13] him show up a lot so um it was one
[8:16] incident I wasn't I wasn't back in
[8:18] church yet but I I kind of started
[8:20] feeling the feeling that I needed to
[8:21] start going back to church this was in
[8:23] the past so um on the day I happened to
[8:26] show up we had a um a visitor so he came
[8:29] up and he gave a testimony on paying his
[8:31] tithes and uh he was like when he paid
[8:34] his tithes you know how God blessed him
[8:35] and everything and um so I was sitting
[8:37] in my seat I'm like well I was listening
[8:39] to him and I had like I had like um
[8:41] maybe $2 or $3 in my purse I don't know
[8:43] how much it was and um I started feeling
[8:46] a little bit of conviction like man
[8:47] maybe I need to start I need to start
[8:48] paying my ties I know it's right but I
[8:50] haven't been doing it so um I said well
[8:52] maybe when I get paid next time I just
[8:54] start from a fresh or whatever and so um
[8:57] it was another feeling that came over
[8:58] like just pay whatever you you got if
[8:59] you got $3 pay 30 cents pay 10% out of
[9:02] it right so I end up putting the 30
[9:04] cents in the TI's basket and um I said
[9:07] okay I'm starting today then so that
[9:10] same week um I took Isaac Isaac was
[9:13] probably about five I took him to the
[9:15] shoe store some money came in from
[9:16] somewhere I think from his dad to get
[9:18] him some shoes so we went to the shoe
[9:20] store and um if you have little boys my
[9:23] my Isaac he was very active so you can't
[9:25] just go buy like $5 tennis shoes that'll
[9:27] be Tor in the first week you know so I
[9:29] was like well I think I probably had
[9:31] like $50 and I was like well let's get
[9:33] something maybe $45 or something with a
[9:35] little bit of quality in it
[9:38] right so um he was looking in the Jordan
[9:41] section everybody know Jordans cost a
[9:43] lot right so he was looking in the
[9:44] expensive section and Wan the best shoes
[9:46] I'm like I said we can't do that you got
[9:47] to come on this side so um this lady
[9:51] overheard us and she was like um let him
[9:53] pick whatever shoe he want so I'm like
[9:55] are you sure she was like yeah let him
[9:57] pick whatever shoes he want I'm like man
[9:59] that change everything you know so I'm
[10:00] like I don't even know what to pick now
[10:02] you know so he's looking and looking at
[10:04] everything and I guess we're taking too
[10:06] much time and she's like she said um
[10:08] finally finally she's getting ready to
[10:09] leave so she's like here's like I think
[10:11] she gave me $300 she was like here's
[10:13] $300 or $200 something in that 100 list
[10:17] she like just let them pick and y'all
[10:19] take your time or whatever I like are
[10:20] you sure but anyway the point is God is
[10:22] so good and he do open up the windows
[10:25] and I just it just reflect back to that
[10:26] little 30 cents I put in that basket or
[10:28] 20 cents
[10:30] so that was one testimony but God is so
[10:32] faithful and um he met us when we needed
[10:34] it because Isaac was in Need for sure um
[10:37] the second one is it was a situation
[10:40] this is a weak moment again where God
[10:42] definitely showed up and this happened
[10:44] um recently but I was at a customer
[10:46] house and uh this particular customer I
[10:49] wasn't it was to me it was Pastime for
[10:53] me to go it was too many little things
[10:54] happening and I was feeling
[10:55] uncomfortable and um uh I I just kind of
[10:59] went ahead and gave him one last shot
[11:01] just to get the house cleaned for him so
[11:05] um he ended up uh in my point of view
[11:09] kind of belittling me a little bit and
[11:11] um when I showed up and so ain't going
[11:14] to lie y'all I felt I I felt a little
[11:16] flurry inside I was feeling myself
[11:18] getting a little bit flurry you know
[11:19] like okay I Lord I don't know how I'm
[11:21] going to be able to clean this house
[11:22] feeling anger inside you know so um
[11:25] anyway I just walked off and I I just
[11:27] started working and somehow God help me
[11:29] to stay humble and calm but inside I was
[11:31] I was feeling upset I ain't going to lie
[11:33] so um I was feeling upset and I was
[11:36] reflecting on other stuff that already
[11:37] had happened and um I was like Lord I
[11:39] can't be in this man house feeling this
[11:40] way about him and you know just help me
[11:42] because I feel like just spraying and
[11:44] wiping stuff and hurry up and getting
[11:45] out of there you know that's how I felt
[11:47] but I was like Lord please help me so
[11:48] something came over me and was like just
[11:50] do it as you're doing it unto me you
[11:52] know and that really helped me calm down
[11:54] in each room just take my time do it
[11:56] right and just you know just I kept
[11:58] saying the Lord help help me in each
[11:59] room help me cuz I it take me probably
[12:01] like 4 hours but it felt like it was
[12:03] taking forever cuz I was feeling that
[12:05] feeling inside so um but the Lord helped
[12:07] me to calm down and um after after I
[12:11] left he called me the next day he was
[12:13] like when I woke up I just felt like um
[12:16] he said you can feel the clean you can
[12:18] feel the clean and I was like yeah thank
[12:21] the Lord for that cuz definitely if I
[12:23] just did it on my own you would have
[12:24] felt something else but um but no I just
[12:26] want to thank the Lord he's so good and
[12:28] he just shows up and he understands all
[12:31] of your all of my feelings and you can't
[12:33] hide it from him he knows when the
[12:35] courage you know comfort you he knows
[12:37] when to You Can't Hide and just say I'm
[12:38] not feeling it I don't you know he knows
[12:40] he knows when to show up and I'm just so
[12:42] grateful for him I don't know what I'd
[12:44] do without him each step of the way I
[12:45] won't lie so just want to lift him up
[12:48] that's
[12:54] it amen so thankful for those
[12:58] testimonies they may seem little but
[13:00] I'll tell you um you never know how God
[13:04] can use your testimony to you get up and
[13:07] tell it or tell it to
[13:09] somebody and um I remember you told that
[13:12] testimony about Isaac and it just shows
[13:14] how he's own time God you know a present
[13:17] help in the time of need but something
[13:19] else you just said that just um um
[13:22] reminded me of the situation there clean
[13:25] and you said the Lord said whatever you
[13:27] do do it unto me
[13:29] that is such a key we were recently um
[13:32] at our tree practice and one of the
[13:34] ministers there started to talk to the
[13:36] kids about a a little sermonette and he
[13:39] used that scripture he said whatever you
[13:40] do do it unto the Lord whatever you do
[13:43] even if your parents say you know you
[13:45] need to do this and you need to clean
[13:47] your room instead of being angry say
[13:49] Lord I want to do it for you in
[13:51] everything you do do it and it changes
[13:54] your attitude of what you do whether
[13:56] good or bad or how you feel do it unto
[13:58] him and you'll receive more of a
[14:00] blessing you'll receive more of a
[14:02] presence of God come into the atmosphere
[14:05] and it just you don't worry about the
[14:06] temporal things in God I live my life

[25:54] group there is a way
[25:56] out right and the day cometh shall burn
[25:59] them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it
[26:02] shall leave them neither root nor Branch
[26:05] but unto you that fear my name shall the

[26:12] grow up as calves of the stall and you
[26:14] shall tread down the wicked for they

[26:20] sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the
[26:23] law of Moses my servant which I
[26:25] commanded unto him in horror before all
[26:26] Israel with the statutes and judg
[26:29] behold I will send you Elijah the
[26:31] prophet before the great the coming of
[26:35] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[26:36] and he shall turn the heart of the
[26:38] father to the children and the Heart of
[26:40] the children to their fathers now we
[26:41] know that's two people right same coming
[26:44] of Elijah but it's two different people
[26:46] John the Baptist did one then brother
[26:48] randam did the other are the Elijah of
[26:50] the end time is doing the other one
[26:52] we'll break that down in just a minute
[26:54] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[26:56] curse you may be seated the Lord as
[26:58] blessing also read Revelations
[27:01] 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the
[27:05] seventh angel we have heard that
[27:10] voice this is Tuesday night this not
[27:13] Wednesday night it's Tuesday night
[27:14] you've only had one day of work since
[27:16] Sunday you ought to be happy tomorrow's
[27:19] the day you're supposed to H
[27:21] go when he shall begin to sound the
[27:23] mystery of God should be finished as
[27:25] Heath declared to his servants the
[27:27] prophets
[27:29] Revelations 18:3 for all nations have
[27:31] drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
[27:33] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[27:35] have committed fornication with her and
[27:38] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[27:39] Rich to the abundance of her
[27:42] Delicacies that's what's coming now
[27:45] that's what's coming right I'm telling
[27:48] you that's what's coming now and I heard
[27:50] another voice from Heaven saying come
[27:52] out of her my people that you be not
[27:54] partakers of her sins and that you
[27:56] receive not of her plagues for her sins
[27:59] have reached unto heaven and God ha
[28:01] remembered her iniquities thank God
[28:03] we're not in that group thank God there
[28:06] is a group of people that that will not
[28:08] ever happen to and that's the Bride of
[28:11] Jesus Christ our sins actually did go to
[28:15] heaven it actually went to hell and then
[28:18] God destroyed him and he went to heaven
[28:20] and then he come back on the day of
[28:23] Pentecost to live inside of a group of
[28:25] people amen cuz we're going to be reward
[28:28] rewarded but she's going to be re
[28:29] rewarded double unto her according to
[28:31] her works and the cup which she has
[28:33] filled filled to her
[28:36] double there's a Time
[28:39] coming folks that this is just we're
[28:41] sitting here today and we're I was
[28:43] thinking
[28:44] yesterday um we sit here today and we we
[28:48] have a Thanksgiving and junor and I went
[28:50] to the went to uh kroger just a few
[28:52] minutes ago and uh buggies were
[28:56] full people were driving in and Mercedes
[29:00] and buying groceries and buying stuff

[29:06] thing may not be in a Mercedes but we're
[29:08] going to go buy stuff and we're going to
[29:09] take it home and we're going to eat it
[29:11] we're living good right now but there's
[29:14] going to come a time that there's
[29:15] something going to come to where you and
[29:17] I are not going to be able to do this
[29:19] anymore I want you I know you say well I
[29:22] know brother Brown said that well you
[29:23] know what it's going to come to pass
[29:25] amen and if we believe we're the end
[29:27] time people going to be in your
[29:30] life this is going to happen okay but
[29:34] don't be scared God said he would take
[29:36] care of us hello God said he would take
[29:39] care of us now the listen the government
[29:41] can say they take care of you
[29:44] baloney your boss said he'll take care
[29:46] of you baloney your job says it'll take
[29:50] care of you baloney God's the only one
[29:52] that'll ever take care of you and we got
[29:54] to put our faith in him let that be our
[29:57] thanks given that we put our faith in
[30:00] him and that his faith work let his
[30:02] faith be the one that takes us out of
[30:04] here
[30:06] amen this is a quote that that
[30:10] um Tim read and I'll read it
[30:13] again cuz it's look what a message for
[30:15] the occasion to me they were sitting
[30:18] there thinking what does this got to do
[30:20] with Thanksgiving brother randam I'm
[30:21] sure he caught their thought you may say
[30:25] what's this all got to do with
[30:26] Thanksgiving what you talking about
[30:27] brother them here it is quarter to nine
[30:29] you didn't say nothing about
[30:30] Thanksgiving what a message for the
[30:32] occasion to me they didn't get it they
[30:35] didn't get he was preaching the greatest
[30:37] Thanksgiving M message that ever was is
[30:41] that there's going to be a bride that's
[30:42] being separated from the world as he
[30:45] said the pilgrim fathers were separated
[30:48] from the old English denomination and
[30:50] Creed they could marry to a new anointed
[30:52] word for their age uh brother Tim and I
[30:54] were talking afterwards I I've looked
[30:56] back in a few um uh looked back at the
[30:59] history of Washington and and Jefferson
[31:01] and and Benjamin Franklin and all those
[31:03] people uh there was never a recording it
[31:06] was never recorded they went back to
[31:09] England when they separated they left
[31:11] that place right they probably left the
[31:14] house over there they probably left
[31:16] family and possessions now of course
[31:18] they may have come on later but when
[31:19] they came that's why Jesus stood one day
[31:23] and he said I didn't come to bring peace
[31:27] he said I come to bring a sword he said
[31:30] father's going to be against mother
[31:32] children against their fathers amen
[31:35] that's hard to believe but you look at
[31:36] it it's in my life and it's in yours
[31:38] right
[31:39] now there is a division between
[31:42] Christianity and somebody that's not a
[31:45] Christian if you're if you're in that
[31:47] gray area and that your your kids don't
[31:49] know the difference you need to get to
[31:52] praying or if you're brother or family
[31:54] member or somebody don't know that you
[31:56] are different you've been
[31:59] separated you look different you act
[32:02] different you do different things then
[32:04] you got a problem right amen
[32:08] separated and then what we're going to
[32:10] connect to though is marry to the new
[32:13] anointed word for their age well what's
[32:15] the anointed word for our age is to come
[32:18] to a
[32:19] resurrection and then a body change and
[32:22] then we'll leave this place all right
[32:24] it's not to come to
[32:26] justification it's not to just come to
[32:28] sanctification it's not just to come to
[32:30] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll read
[32:33] it to you in a few
[32:34] minutes remember brother Bram said the
[32:36] Holy Ghost comes and then the Holy Ghost
[32:38] he makes way for the Holy Ghost himself
[32:40] well that sound to a theologian that
[32:42] would sound kind of strange but I
[32:44] understand it
[32:45] completely but we'll read it to in just
[32:47] a few
[32:48] minutes so we can be thankful as
[32:50] pilgrims like Abraham separating oursel
[32:52] from the things of the world all of our
[32:55] Associates Abraham was a pilgrim gone
[32:57] God has separated us from all the dead
[33:00] religions speaking Across the Nation now
[33:02] all the dead Creeds separated us and
[33:05] opened to us a new land now watch a new
[33:07] message for this day amen right for this
[33:12] day Pentecost dried up and died like
[33:14] Luther Wesley and the rest of them it's
[33:16] no more than a bunch of church churches
[33:19] pulled together good people has got to
[33:22] come out and we know that we were one of
[33:24] those people some of us may not even
[33:26] been born during that time but some were
[33:27] and you were in denominational uh ideas
[33:30] and Pentecost and all those different
[33:32] things so what did he do now here's what
[33:34] we going to look he
[33:36] opened something was
[33:39] closed something was closed down through
[33:42] all the church ages that no man could
[33:44] get a hold
[33:45] of everybody with me you see how special
[33:48] this message is no one I'm talking about
[33:51] Paul all the way to the Great Men coming
[33:54] up to the day of Pentecost 1906a Street
[33:58] the word was not fully opened until the
[34:02] prophet in the end time broke those
[34:04] SEALS or the lamb broke those seals amen
[34:07] amen that's why I'm telling you this
[34:10] transition we got a transition and I
[34:12] believe now I see what Paul's saying we
[34:14] got to go on to Perfection not laying
[34:17] aside not let not preaching on water
[34:18] baptism all the time not preaching on
[34:21] you got to be good all the time
[34:26] right I know you got to do do that cuz
[34:28] there's a mix the audience and there's
[34:29] different people here at different
[34:31] levels but you still we've got to come
[34:33] to a realization that unless you see now
[34:36] not me unless you see that the seals
[34:39] have been opened to you you will not
[34:42] take a body change right amen do y'all
[34:45] hear an amen amen you will not take a
[34:47] body change you will go by the grave if
[34:50] that seal is not open to you
[34:53] completely I'll read it in just a few
[34:55] minutes but brother Brown said that
[34:56] pretty much he opened up the Seven Seals
[34:59] of the last message you notice that the
[35:01] Seven Seals which all the mysteries of
[35:03] the seven Church Ages was sealed with
[35:05] Seven Seals the reformers didn't have
[35:08] time to do it in their day they didn't
[35:10] live long
[35:12] enough but this blessed revelation of
[35:14] the Seven Seals is open to us in this
[35:17] last day do you believe that do you
[35:20] believe now we we do have an open book
[35:23] we'll prove it to you in just a minute I
[35:24] know you've read it before we're going
[35:25] to read it again just to review for a
[35:28] little
[35:30] while healing is the children's bread
[35:33] 1965 it's in the atonement and the
[35:37] atonement first is applied to our
[35:41] souls and healing has always forerun
[35:45] every message I'm slowing down now
[35:47] because I keep forgetting Louis is in
[35:49] there and it's also been a means to
[35:52] gather people together so we know and
[35:54] we've been through it over and over
[35:56] again healing can campaign got the
[35:59] attention of the people Turned the
[36:01] Lights On to healing but brother
[36:04] brandham said that was a
[36:07] minoren we're we're trying to Major on
[36:09] that minor everybody loves the healing
[36:12] campaign but when brother randam
[36:15] transitioned he he already transitioned
[36:17] to Perfection right cuz he did that when
[36:19] the seals open he transitioned over into
[36:22] Perfection and his brother Dell's always
[36:24] told us he said you read the titles
[36:26] after the seals is talking about
[36:28] eternity and it's bringing something so
[36:31] positive way more positive than than
[36:33] we're guessing who mzc is but brother R
[36:36] says who is this
[36:39] mzc all the different things Mighty God
[36:42] unveiled before us invisible Union of
[36:45] the bride of
[36:46] Christ why did he preach that after the
[36:50] seals because it was an open book
[36:55] amen so the atonement is first applied
[36:57] our soul that's why it's so important to
[36:59] be born again if you're not born
[37:02] again
[37:04] hurry
[37:08] hurry cuz you'll get left behind if
[37:10] you're
[37:11] not and healing is always forun every
[37:14] message and it's also been a means to
[37:16] gather the people together many people
[37:19] will sponsor a healing campaign or
[37:21] meeting many will come to it or song
[37:24] festival but when it comes to a poor
[37:26] lost soul to get get saved there's not
[37:28] many people interested in that but
[37:31] that's the main thing Divine Healing and
[37:33] singing festivals and so forth brother
[37:35] BOS what you says the bait on the hook
[37:37] and you show the fish the bait not the
[37:41] hook why because you won't catch
[37:43] anything if you show them the hook all
[37:46] right but show them the bait let them
[37:47] get close enough to they can bite on it
[37:49] and then you can bring them in by what
[37:52] by your
[37:53] life now listen your life is the bait on
[37:56] the hook right amen the Hook's Christ
[38:00] the Hook's not you right the hook is
[38:03] Christ the bait is your life lived in
[38:06] front of somebody wanting to bite the
[38:08] same hook you
[38:09] bit amen amen praise
[38:13] God and that's just the thing to get the
[38:15] people to listen a while till you can
[38:17] really present to them your message
[38:19] that's what it's been all these years
[38:20] we've been fighting down through these
[38:21] ages and we've been we've been listening
[38:23] to different ones and listening to
[38:25] different ones and listening to
[38:26] different ones to now I believe that
[38:29] it's honing time it's honing time to
[38:32] where it's going to hone down to where
[38:34] if you're not in you're
[38:37] out and I don't mean a church I mean you
[38:41] that's
[38:42] right right God has did that in every
[38:45] age through every age there's always
[38:48] been a healing campaign and if it's a
[38:50] genuine healing campaign behind that
[38:52] campaign always is a message there's
[38:55] never a sign given just just for a sign
[38:58] it's for running a message now let me
[39:02] clear something up real quick I know
[39:04] that that some of you that that look
[39:05] around in the message and different
[39:07] things which is fine but there's a lot
[39:09] of people especially the ones just left
[39:11] the message their big their big hangup
[39:13] is is that that brother brandham stole
[39:15] stuff from different
[39:17] people right why is everybody with me I
[39:20] know some of you that's been around you
[39:21] know what I'm talking about that he
[39:23] stole it wasn't a wasn't this great
[39:25] mystery that he opened
[39:27] all right he got it from scoffield or he
[39:31] got it from Clarence Lin or he got it
[39:33] from whoever that other brother was and
[39:35] all the different ones even he listed
[39:38] them he said he looked at their at their
[39:42] um messages amen but remember they did
[39:46] not have a campaign like brother randam
[39:49] had they Clarence Lin was
[39:54] right everybody with me but he a prophet
[39:58] he didn't have everything he was a and
[40:00] that's a that to me that's a paradox
[40:03] that Scofield can talk about we were
[40:04] talking about it Sunday at at the
[40:07] restaurant Clarence LA or Scofield was
[40:11] back in the early 1900s or 1800s
[40:14] 1900s and he talked about a
[40:16] theophany in his writings right down if
[40:18] you'll look in your writings right here
[40:21] right below his commentary he calls it a
[40:23] theophany and he talks about all these
[40:26] different things that brother Brandon
[40:29] read but scoffield was a trinitarian
[40:32] right right so he didn't have he
[40:34] couldn't get all the way out as brother
[40:36] brandham said he couldn't get out of
[40:38] that denomination he was in right
[40:42] everybody with me but brother brandom I
[40:46] he I listen I steal sermons all the
[40:50] time right so what my brother asked me
[40:53] he said he said brother wait do you
[40:54] steal people's sermons I said every
[40:55] service amen Jesus preached him and I'm
[40:59] preaching them again I'm stealing from
[41:00] him brother Brandon preached 1100
[41:02] sermons I picked the quotes out I'm
[41:04] preaching from him so I'm a I'm a
[41:07] thief Hey listen a thief is coming after
[41:10] a thief he said I'll come as a thief in
[41:12] the night I just got that so I am a
[41:15] thief like brother Dale said he's L A
[41:17] Jacob we're Jacob we're shyers we want
[41:20] the word more than
[41:22] anything and if we do then what's God
[41:25] going to do that's the birthright you
[41:27] and I are birthed under we're birthed
[41:30] under that we're not birthed under
[41:31] something else we're not birthed under
[41:33] eating porridge and helping Daddy and
[41:34] doing good cuz L Esau did good Esau was
[41:37] a good guy he was a worker he took care
[41:41] of daddy he went and hunted and shot the
[41:44] game and and Jacob really didn't do a
[41:46] whole
[41:48] lot except stay around his mama his
[41:50] brother said under his mom's
[41:52] coattail but when it come down to the
[41:54] birthright which you and I have have
[41:57] that Birthright tonight the new birth
[42:00] you want it more than anything you don't
[42:02] care how you get it that's right exactly
[42:05] I don't know about you but that's the
[42:06] way I see it
[42:08] amen so there were signs given there was
[42:12] there was people that preach the truth
[42:15] listen Martin Luther preached the truth
[42:17] or he wouldn't have been a church age
[42:18] messenger Right Wesley preached the
[42:20] truth but they didn't preach all the
[42:22] truth they didn't get us to Perfection
[42:25] there was no transition the book was
[42:26] Clos
[42:29] they knew what they were talking about
[42:30] to a
[42:33] degree only ones at the end
[42:36] time look now brother randam is telling
[42:39] us and I'm we're going to separate it
[42:40] right here in just a second the very day
[42:42] when this messenger not when he starts
[42:45] on now look not when he starts what the
[42:47] healing
[42:49] campaign so listen brother brand was
[42:51] message was not a healing
[42:55] campaign amen right
[42:58] now it came right it was part of the
[43:00] message right but what was that remember
[43:03] that was a minor you can't take a body
[43:07] change by listening to the prayer lines
[43:10] of the
[43:12] tapes that's right amen amen there's a
[43:16] lot of people I know that that's all
[43:18] they'll do is listen to prayer line CU
[43:19] they get all emotional they get all that
[43:21] that's okay but that's a
[43:23] minor everybody with me that's a minor
[43:27] right major healing is the body change
[43:31] am amen
[43:33] amen not when he starts on but when he
[43:35] begins to declare his
[43:38] message now when did he begin to declare
[43:41] his message I believe according to what
[43:44] I see in the in the uh message of the
[43:47] hour about the time he got on the spoken
[43:49] words Original Seed he was getting
[43:53] there cuz remember he thought he had s
[43:55] he SED a seed he said I'll read here in
[43:57] a few minutes he sowed a seed he had
[43:59] everything he said soed the entire
[44:01] word but as of yet Malachi 4 had not
[44:06] been completely
[44:08] fulfilled that's right he thought he was
[44:10] at the end he was done got him out on a
[44:12] limb Lord what do I go next the Holy
[44:14] Ghost said Hey listen buddy pick up your
[44:16] pen and I want you to write this down so
[44:19] this is not
[44:21] hearsay if we believe he was a prophet
[44:24] we believe the Holy Ghost wrote that
[44:26] with his hand with brother B's
[44:29] hand so I believe that that is truth
[44:31] then he said as of yet Malachi 4 has not
[44:35] been
[44:35] fulfilled it had been started but it
[44:38] wasn't fulfilled that's right all right
[44:41] and that's okay
[44:42] listen I'm not so dogmatic that I cut
[44:45] the prayer line off and don't and don't
[44:47] listen to it when I or read it when I'm
[44:49] reading a book I don't listen to many
[44:52] sermons I
[44:53] read right but I want to get to meet
[44:56] first
[44:58] if I don't understand what he's saying
[44:59] there I don't it's not going to give me
[45:01] any good over
[45:03] here healing is wonderful we all need
[45:05] something in our body tonight that needs
[45:07] to be
[45:08] healed but it's only
[45:12] temporary that's right brother BR you
[45:15] said you could be healed of cancer one
[45:16] day and die the next is that what we
[45:17] saiding right one day
[45:22] difference but we love it but it's a
[45:25] secondary it's a mind
[45:28] let's major on the
[45:30] major right because remember when the
[45:33] when the book begins to be open as we're
[45:34] going to see here in a minute when that
[45:36] book begins to be
[45:38] open a lot of people didn't follow
[45:40] through that amen they stayed back here
[45:44] they didn't go any further with him they
[45:46] stayed in Old Pentecost and they enjoyed
[45:48] the tongues and they enjoyed this and
[45:49] they enjoyed
[45:51] that but when brother Brown started
[45:53] preaching this message people started
[45:55] going away right
[45:59] Holy Ghost filled
[46:02] people didn't turn him down they just
[46:05] couldn't go as far as he went because it
[46:07] wasn't for their age just like I read
[46:08] y'all the other night in this in the six
[46:10] seal the questions and answers he says
[46:12] gone from you not for you just live a
[46:14] good simple Christian Life In other
[46:16] words these things will be brought up
[46:17] now that the book is open there's going
[46:19] to be a book open book people that's
[46:21] going to understand and not going to
[46:23] have any problem when brother Ram says
[46:25] God and Christ are one
[46:28] not going to have any problem I was
[46:29] reading the seals again or listening to
[46:30] them the other day coming back and so
[46:32] adamant brother randam is talking
[46:35] about God being
[46:38] one right when that first seal opened
[46:41] that was the one God now he got a one
[46:44] God Revelation before but this was
[46:46] solidified when he saw something else go
[46:50] away and God was standing there now
[46:52] brother R wasn't God but the lamb was
[46:55] standing there Lamb's only could open
[46:57] the seal so so who was it was a lamb
[46:59] through his voice everybody with me it
[47:03] was a lamb here stands a lamb with a
[47:05] book in his hand and there goes somebody
[47:06] if there's two therefore one's got to be
[47:08] true and one's got to be false
[47:10] righten pretty simple but they didn't
[47:13] get
[47:15] that right did it stop people from
[47:17] believing in a trinity
[47:20] no they just shut the book back up and
[47:23] went off again right right all right
[47:26] first PLL healing second pull prophecy
[47:31] now we can get and we'll get into the
[47:32] Visions here a little bit later
[47:35] on because the first pool was remember
[47:38] it was fishing and it was catching
[47:39] little fish and it was uh getting stuff
[47:42] all tangled up the line all tangled up
[47:45] and brother talking about tying up baby
[47:46] shoes that's all an
[47:49] allegory that's all something that
[47:51] brother R breaks it down right here in
[47:53] this one quote right here the first pull
[47:56] was The Healing
[47:58] Ministry all right catching trying to
[48:01] get the fish in the second pull was
[48:05] taken not taken by the hand
[48:07] anymore but
[48:09] remember when he come into that second
[48:12] pull he was telling them the thoughts
[48:14] and intents of their heart is that right
[48:17] and it was perfect never missed it one
[48:20] time not one time right so he's heading
[48:23] into that transition to perfection even
[48:26] in the second
[48:27] Paul right but under that prophecy there
[48:32] was imitation oh yeah right brother
[48:36] Brown said Remember the angel said they
[48:39] can't imitate
[48:41] this right when we get to the third pull
[48:44] the opening of the word the Myster is
[48:47] revealed Satan can't go there folks
[48:50] that's what's going to destroy Satan is
[48:53] that we're going to separate from him
[48:54] right everybody with me amen amen I was
[48:57] looking at at all of our bodies you know
[49:00] um something like I said something's
[49:02] wrong with everybody we just we just
[49:04] literally got to deny this outside of
[49:07] our
[49:09] self just deny it it ain't it's like
[49:12] brother
[49:14] um who oh brother Jimmy Harris he said
[49:16] this just ain't so this is not what we
[49:18] supposed to be right this came to get us
[49:21] to a place but this thing is just rotten
[49:24] it's just it stinks
[49:27] but the thing inside of you is worth
[49:29] 10,000
[49:31] worlds let's feed that
[49:34] thing amen yes sir right now look third
[49:38] pull the opening of the word the mystery
[49:39] revealed no more now look there's no
[49:41] more higher order to reveal the word
[49:43] then prophets so he had to step in now
[49:45] he was a prophet from birth anybody with
[49:48] me but he was fulfilling the second part
[49:50] of his prophetic Ministry when he stood
[49:53] there and started opening those seals
[49:56] we'll get to in just a second but the
[49:58] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[50:01] is by the word and remember the third
[50:03] pull was the opening now here's what the
[50:06] third pull
[50:08] is wake up and
[50:11] realize the third pull is the opening of
[50:15] the
[50:15] seals when that Mighty angel came down
[50:18] to Revelations
[50:20] 10 right and the voice came from the
[50:23] seventh angel John listened to him
[50:26] because he was Tope of the Bride
[50:28] right and that seventh angel
[50:32] messenger did not have the
[50:35] book come on we'll read it in a
[50:39] minute that book was in the hand of the
[50:41] mighty angel that Mighty Angel give it
[50:44] to
[50:44] John but it took a seventh angel
[50:47] Messenger to what literally turn us to
[50:51] Christ the real person now he wasn't
[50:53] false back here but I'll read it to you
[50:56] in a minute because I've read it to you
[50:57] many times before brother rown said the
[50:59] Holy Ghost can only work on what you
[51:01] give
[51:02] it right because it's been bound by two
[51:05] by denominations for 2,000 years bound
[51:09] the Holy Ghost has been bound by what
[51:11] our
[51:14] Traditions that River e frates is in
[51:16] your
[51:17] brain it ain't a river Over Yonder
[51:19] there's not a bunch of you know people
[51:21] holding
[51:23] down your thoughts and ideas contrary to
[51:26] the word of
[51:28] God remember the third pull was the
[51:30] opening of them Seven Seals to reveal
[51:32] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[51:35] the
[51:36] word they could not get it it was sealed
[51:39] up all right end time seed
[51:42] sign there's a revival going on what is
[51:45] it a sewing you don't hear very much of
[51:47] Billy Graham no more this is 1962 all
[51:49] right now look 1962 things were winding
[51:52] down in that first part of the
[51:55] ministry even his he'll say even
[51:59] mine what about oral what about the rest
[52:01] of them you know the great Revival fire
[52:03] is not burning what is it it's the end
[52:05] time seed sign the words has been sown
[52:09] what is it denominational will reap
[52:12] denominational that makes them
[52:13] Confederate themselves
[52:16] together now somewhere folks we're
[52:19] living in that time where we're going to
[52:21] see every church denomination come
[52:24] together under one head right amen come
[52:27] on don't don't un amen that that's
[52:30] exactly what's going to happen we're
[52:32] going to be left out
[52:34] right but the word of God has been seed
[52:37] also and when the spirit of God begins
[52:39] to fall now watch when the spirit of God
[52:42] begins to fall the word of God will live
[52:45] in the
[52:47] people this is not a tape Ministry this
[52:50] is a live People Ministry right
[52:53] amen and that false bride that's
[52:56] committed adultery out there and brought
[52:58] herself into Creeds and sold out her
[53:00] Birthright will reap what a
[53:02] confederation of church that's to be
[53:04] bound and burned like thorns and
[53:06] thistles but where the word of God's
[53:08] been swed into the people's
[53:11] heart former rain is the sewing rain we
[53:14] have been under that rain for a long
[53:17] time God's getting ready to harvest he's
[53:20] going to send the Harvest rain to
[53:22] harvest what he planted from the day of
[53:25] Pentecost to the today amen I believe
[53:28] that with all my heart it will reap a
[53:30] bride for Christ as certain as I'm
[53:32] standing here end time
[53:35] signs and 1962 this is where I'll quote
[53:38] this where brother brandham talks about
[53:40] pick up your pen and WR this is
[53:43] 1962 God has promised be careful God has
[53:46] promised Malachi 4 for this last day and
[53:48] Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but
[53:52] it must be fulfilled all right is
[53:54] everybody with me that's 1962
[53:57] yep now the first part of it had been
[54:00] fulfilled but not the whole completion
[54:02] of it right all
[54:04] right we'll break it down in just a
[54:06] minute for it is a gerti word of God
[54:09] spoken through Malachi the prophet Jesus
[54:12] referred to it it is to be just before
[54:14] the coming of Christ the second time
[54:16] listen close all scripture that's not
[54:18] been fulfilled must be before that time
[54:20] the Bible has to be finished to be
[54:23] finished the Gentile dispensation is to
[54:25] be finished with the church age when
[54:28] this anointed messenger
[54:30] arrives but of course he will plant the
[54:32] seed of the entire Bible from from the
[54:35] serpent to the messenger in the former
[54:37] Reign then he will be rejected who's he
[54:40] talking about himself that's right right
[54:43] then he will be rejected by the
[54:45] denominational people as his forefather
[54:48] John and Elijah as was spoken by our
[54:52] Lord restoration of the brid tree now
[54:55] what we got to do is we've got to now
[54:57] we're going to start separating all
[54:58] right everybody with me come out of her
[55:01] my people all
[55:03] right because if you look at brother
[55:06] brandham all during his messages up
[55:08] until here in 62 he pretty much talks
[55:11] about three manifestation justification
[55:13] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:14] everybody with me all right now when you
[55:17] get to 1962 the restoration of the Bride
[55:19] tree um spoken words Original Seed some
[55:22] other messages I only brought one quote
[55:24] but there's several others he talks
[55:26] about
[55:27] four all right cuz you got to restore
[55:29] back the full word right amen all right
[55:31] the full word if four messengers of
[55:33] death killed the tree for messengers of
[55:35] life will restore it I will restore he's
[55:39] not going to restore just part of the
[55:40] limbs he's going to restore that tree
[55:42] back to the
[55:44] leaves then to the
[55:46] seed he's not going to just start with
[55:49] and have half limbs over here and some
[55:50] of them dead no he's going to restore
[55:52] the whole tree back right amen sir
[55:56] by four death Messengers killed it then
[55:58] four life Messengers will restore it
[56:00] what was the first Martin Luther
[56:02] justification what was the
[56:04] second John Wesley by sanctification
[56:07] what was the third Pentecost with the
[56:09] restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost
[56:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the
[56:12] fourth the word now wasn't that the word
[56:15] I want you to get they they didn't teach
[56:17] all false
[56:19] word they had truth but they didn't have
[56:23] all the
[56:24] truth right they were not working under
[56:27] an open
[56:29] book and they will be in Bride they will
[56:32] be the bride amen amen come on Martin
[56:35] Luther will have a group that stand over
[56:37] there in the sixth Dimension waiting on
[56:39] us to bring them here John Wesley's
[56:41] waiting on a group over there even John
[56:44] Smith and different ones white moody
[56:47] right but they never had a complete
[56:49] message like this prophet in the end
[56:51] time that's right they never had a
[56:53] completion they never were required to
[56:55] bring everything back to way it was
[56:58] before that's
[57:03] right here's where in the Masterpiece I
[57:05] read it to you the other
[57:07] day justification made a way for
[57:10] sanctification sanctification made a way
[57:12] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hope
[57:14] you realize in this church we believe in
[57:16] those works of Grace am we believe in
[57:19] every one of them and we believe in
[57:20] going over them again
[57:23] right huh sir there a higher form
[57:26] brother BR says of justification a
[57:27] higher form of
[57:29] sanctification cuz sanctification W even
[57:31] make you bride
[57:33] now but sanctification under the I Die
[57:36] daily in the in the uh statute of
[57:39] perfect man will make you better will
[57:41] make you a what a mature Christian right
[57:45] and mature Christians is what God's
[57:46] looking
[57:47] for right he's not looking for a bunch
[57:50] of
[57:52] babies sanctification made way for the
[57:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[57:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost all right if
[58:00] you got one justification two
[58:01] sanctification three the baptism of the
[58:03] Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[58:07] itself to come right down in Perfection
[58:11] back to the word again to manifest
[58:13] itself all
[58:15] right to me that's the open book because
[58:18] remember in 1957 I read you this quote
[58:20] several times we need something to work
[58:23] on before the Holy Ghost can ever go to
[58:25] work
[58:27] that's why brother Brown stood there
[58:28] that day and he said he's been bound
[58:30] bound for 2,000 years by Creeds whose
[58:32] Creeds your
[58:34] Creeds their Creeds the world's Creeds
[58:38] he's been
[58:39] bound but he's got to have something to
[58:42] work with you know that's
[58:46] right we grieve the Holy Ghost yes sir
[58:50] I'm sorry Point your finger at
[58:54] me if you never felt Grieves in your
[58:57] heart you don't have the Holy Ghost
[58:59] right
[59:00] amen oh I just don't have that kind of I
[59:03] don't live that kind of life well I
[59:04] don't live that kind of life either that
[59:05] I used to before but I do live a human
[59:09] life somebody ever cut you off I'm not
[59:12] going
[59:13] there that's the biggest one people
[59:16] cutting somebody off in a car it's just
[59:20] demon cars I guess I don't know but you
[59:22] start talking about that and everybody's
[59:23] like
[59:26] go
[59:32] ahead it's just a car just a
[59:36] driver I used to do the same thing but
[59:38] now I say bless them Lord don't let them
[59:40] have a
[59:45] wreck it's those little things that
[59:48] don't make me no be anybody else I but I
[59:51] don't like I'm not going to stop and
[59:52] help somebody on the side of the road
[59:54] I'm sorry unless God brings my car and
[59:57] rolls it over in front over here and off
[59:59] the side I ain't going to stop helping
[1:00:01] nobody I'm just sorry I'm that way but
[1:00:04] if the Lord directs me I sure will but I
[1:00:06] I drive by I said Lord send them
[1:00:08] somebody better than me that can work on
[1:00:10] that car that can get that car going cuz
[1:00:13] if I stop and that you know the motor
[1:00:15] blowed up I'm just going to go what I do
[1:00:19] what are you going to
[1:00:20] do if they got a flat tire and they
[1:00:22] don't have a spare and you don't have a
[1:00:23] spare you're still worthless
[1:00:26] but God send somebody by them by there
[1:00:28] that's got a spare
[1:00:30] tire I may be crazy but I believe I just
[1:00:33] believe God will do it too and I don't
[1:00:35] have to look back in the rear ofie
[1:00:36] mirror to figure out if you did or
[1:00:39] not right aren't we supposed to make
[1:00:42] this world better this world is never
[1:00:44] better without the bride the bride makes
[1:00:46] the world a better place amen that's
[1:00:49] right so her messenger in Malachi 4 he's
[1:00:52] promised to do it and the messenger this
[1:00:54] the birth pain is to bring back the word
[1:00:57] bring the people back to the word birth
[1:00:59] is to be she's to be delivered of a new
[1:01:02] birth not a new New Birth everybody with
[1:01:05] me not a new way he's bringing back the
[1:01:09] old way that happened on the day of
[1:01:12] Pentecost to
[1:01:14] today not shaking a hand not speaking
[1:01:17] tongues not this not that that everybody
[1:01:19] has decided this is what's going to
[1:01:23] happen to be delivered of a new birth
[1:01:26] from According to Malachi 4 what do
[1:01:29] Malachi 4 birth do it turns you
[1:01:32] back to the original faith of the
[1:01:35] fathers all
[1:01:37] right now let's break it down real quick
[1:01:40] maybe we'll just stop at the end of
[1:01:42] this this is from the lean Church age
[1:01:45] now we read this many many times
[1:01:47] before now brother R tells us this
[1:01:50] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations
[1:01:52] 10:7 is going to do two things all right
[1:01:55] we kind of slide through these things
[1:01:57] sometimes and don't break them down but
[1:01:58] let's break them down for a
[1:02:00] minute number one according to Malachi 4
[1:02:05] he will turn the hearts of the children
[1:02:07] to the fathers what is that the hearts
[1:02:10] of the Babylon Pentecostal baby children
[1:02:13] that believe speaking in tongues is it
[1:02:15] that believes that they have to have a
[1:02:17] healing campaign that believes they have
[1:02:19] to have a shout that believes they have
[1:02:20] to have tongues and interpretations they
[1:02:22] service or they're
[1:02:24] lost hello right
[1:02:27] right
[1:02:29] right but what does it
[1:02:31] do Brother Anderson when God turns your
[1:02:34] heart back to the original faith of the
[1:02:36] fathers you're born again right you get
[1:02:40] the new birth you are
[1:02:42] redeemed amen all right everybody with
[1:02:44] me amen y'all must be thinking about
[1:02:50] turkey that's
[1:02:52] okay Revelations 5 so let's turn to
[1:02:55] Revelations 5 let's break this down just
[1:02:56] a few minutes now remember the messenger
[1:02:59] Malachi for is to do two things one he's
[1:03:01] to turn the hearts what is your heart
[1:03:04] your heart is not what thumps your heart
[1:03:06] is your
[1:03:07] soul amen amen he's going to turn your
[1:03:10] soul back to the faith of the fathers
[1:03:13] your soul was what claimed by the
[1:03:17] devil that old nature was attached to it
[1:03:21] and brother Tim was talking about and
[1:03:23] I've said we all said it many times
[1:03:24] before and unless your old husband's
[1:03:27] dead you can't get born again amen you
[1:03:30] cannot marry Christ if you have a living
[1:03:34] husband amen that's just a fact can't
[1:03:37] hang him up he's got to be dead amen so
[1:03:42] that's what brother Ram come preaching
[1:03:44] get the new birth remember the healing
[1:03:47] campaign bring them in preach to them
[1:03:49] Christ bring them in preach to them
[1:03:52] Christ not not so much Mysteries
[1:03:56] right sure he went in he went in all
[1:03:59] that but remember he said If Ever I
[1:04:00] bring a a message of of Doctrine I bring
[1:04:03] it at the Tabernacle
[1:04:06] right so now let's go to Revelations 5
[1:04:08] now what is Revelations 5 Revelations 5
[1:04:12] is
[1:04:14] redemption plain and simple amen that's
[1:04:18] where you see yourself redeemed
[1:04:22] right
[1:04:23] right but not mature
[1:04:28] right
[1:04:30] right I prove it to you in Revelations
[1:04:32] 10 why would we need a mighty Angel to
[1:04:34] come down with an open
[1:04:36] book if everything of redemption is over
[1:04:39] in Revelations 5 we know it is we know
[1:04:42] redemption's
[1:04:44] over as many people say you know you
[1:04:47] can't get saved because redemption's
[1:04:48] over and 1963 the the this person came
[1:04:52] off The Mercy Seat
[1:04:56] brother brandham was
[1:04:58] projecting a mystery down to right here
[1:05:01] today there will be a day
[1:05:03] amen there will be a day when Jesus
[1:05:05] steps off of that mercy seat and it
[1:05:07] becomes a judgment seat and listen he's
[1:05:09] not going to sit down again that's right
[1:05:12] he's not going to reset down in the in
[1:05:15] the in the uh as the denomination say
[1:05:17] you can get saved after the Rapture
[1:05:19] takes place when he gets up off that
[1:05:21] Mercy Seat when that last name is called
[1:05:24] what's you going to do with an open book
[1:05:25] going to close it amen and it's going to
[1:05:28] be closed until you see it in Book of
[1:05:31] Revelations 19 2021 when the book was
[1:05:36] open amen
[1:05:39] amen but that's a judgment book then
[1:05:41] that's not a book of redemption that's a
[1:05:44] book of judgment right am I correct all
[1:05:48] right so now I saw in the right hand of
[1:05:51] him that sat on the throne a book
[1:05:52] written within and on the back side
[1:05:54] sealed
[1:05:55] all right so it was sealed up with Seven
[1:06:00] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[1:06:02] proclaiming with a loud
[1:06:04] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:06:06] loose the seals
[1:06:10] thereof no man in
[1:06:13] Heaven Nor in
[1:06:16] Earth nor under the
[1:06:19] Earth was able to open the book neither
[1:06:22] to look on it this book was so
[1:06:26] sacred there was only one person that
[1:06:29] could take this book right now remember
[1:06:33] who was sitting on the
[1:06:35] throne the father everybody with me God
[1:06:40] the man that took the book back from
[1:06:45] Adam amen held it until Christ
[1:06:51] came and then Christ had to die and go
[1:06:54] on to release the names out of this book
[1:06:59] The Lamb took the book and opened
[1:07:04] it and the reading of the names of
[1:07:06] everyone in that book started on the day
[1:07:09] of
[1:07:10] Pentecost and every sermon that was
[1:07:12] preached every name that was called
[1:07:14] everyone that was born again was in that
[1:07:17] book and their name was
[1:07:20] called right tonight he's calling your
[1:07:22] name do you hear it amen right right
[1:07:25] John had a fit when he saw his name
[1:07:31] amen and I wept much because no man was
[1:07:34] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:07:38] book neither to look their
[1:07:40] own and one of the elders saying unto me
[1:07:43] said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of
[1:07:46] the tribe of Judah now we can get in all
[1:07:48] these symbols but not tonight the root
[1:07:51] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:07:56] and loose those Seven Seals they loose
[1:07:59] the Seven Seals
[1:08:00] thereof and I beheld in low in the midst
[1:08:02] of the throne and of the four beasts the
[1:08:05] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:08:06] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:08:09] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:08:10] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[1:08:14] he came and took the book out of the
[1:08:15] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:08:17] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:08:19] The Four beast and four and 20 Elders
[1:08:22] now who are the four Beast
[1:08:26] that's your new
[1:08:28] birth all
[1:08:31] right so under this message of Malachi 4
[1:08:34] let me give you a little hint if you
[1:08:36] don't see your name in the
[1:08:39] book it wasn't there to begin with right
[1:08:42] amen exctly if you don't see your name
[1:08:45] that that that that God sent us a
[1:08:46] prophet to show us who we are in that
[1:08:49] book then you got a
[1:08:52] problem I can see my name and everything
[1:08:54] from from from from when God in Genesis
[1:08:57] 3:15 said I'll put enmity between thy
[1:08:59] seed and a woman's seed and I'm going to
[1:09:01] come and I'm going to bring it back
[1:09:02] together well who' he bring it back
[1:09:03] together for right us amen he brought it
[1:09:07] back together for me and you right when
[1:09:10] he had taken the book The Four beast and
[1:09:12] four and 20 Elders fell down before the
[1:09:15] lamb having every one of them hearts and
[1:09:16] golden vows full of odors which are the
[1:09:18] prayers of the Saints don't think your
[1:09:20] prayer doesn't mean anything it's
[1:09:22] mentioned right here and they sung a new
[1:09:25] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:09:28] book and open the seals thereof for thou
[1:09:31] was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by
[1:09:34] thy blood out of every Kindred tongue
[1:09:36] and people and nation and H has made un
[1:09:39] look made
[1:09:42] us what did this taking of the book
[1:09:46] do he redeemed what was in the book now
[1:09:49] wasn't open yet right he took the book
[1:09:51] out of the hand of the owner the
[1:09:54] original owner and then he opened them
[1:09:57] then he opened the book right right all
[1:10:00] right and what did that do during that
[1:10:04] time it made us unto our God Kings and
[1:10:07] Priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:10:10] I beheld and heard the voice of many
[1:10:11] angels round about the throne and the
[1:10:13] Beast and the elders the number of them
[1:10:14] were 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of
[1:10:18] thousands boy what a
[1:10:19] bride saying with a loud voice Worthy is
[1:10:23] the Lamb that was slain to receive power
[1:10:25] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[1:10:26] honor and glory and
[1:10:32] blessings you and I proclaimed with a
[1:10:35] loud voice when you got born again I
[1:10:38] don't care if you just said Thank You
[1:10:39] Lord that's right that rang into
[1:10:43] eternity all the angels in heaven said
[1:10:46] another
[1:10:47] one another one's been called there's
[1:10:50] another one that's come that's me so
[1:10:54] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[1:10:56] receive power and riches but what's he
[1:10:57] going to do with that though he's going
[1:11:00] to transfer it to a bride cuz he's
[1:11:02] fixing to take what the power that's in
[1:11:04] this book that's sealed up he's fixing
[1:11:05] to give it to somebody everybody with me
[1:11:09] all right we'll be done in just a second
[1:11:10] let's read what brother Bram said now
[1:11:12] look he's not an animal he took the
[1:11:15] book in a Syle form he was a lamb but it
[1:11:19] was a human being it was your kinsman
[1:11:23] redeemer it was God in human flesh
[1:11:28] right he took the book out of the right
[1:11:30] hand of him that s on the throne who was
[1:11:32] it the owner the original owner that had
[1:11:35] the book of redemption in his right hand
[1:11:37] No Angel no Angelic being nothing else
[1:11:39] could take the place and this bloody
[1:11:41] lamb walked out and took the book out of
[1:11:43] his hand what was it brother this is the
[1:11:46] most Sublime thing in the
[1:11:52] scripture the most Sublime thing in the
[1:11:55] scripture an act that not an angel not
[1:11:59] nothing could do it and the lamb come
[1:12:01] and took it from the right hand of him
[1:12:03] that sat upon the throne what is it now
[1:12:06] it belongs to the lamb amen right okay
[1:12:11] now this book doesn't belong to the
[1:12:13] father we know they're the same person
[1:12:16] is just a transfer of power right
[1:12:18] because remember what does right hand
[1:12:20] mean right hand's power right he didn't
[1:12:22] just take it like brother Brown said
[1:12:24] from a big old right hand
[1:12:26] right no he took the power and gave it
[1:12:28] to the lamb because the lamb was
[1:12:32] worthy the
[1:12:35] breach now watch real close this is
[1:12:37] something you must get now he has been
[1:12:39] doing his mediatorial work making
[1:12:41] intercession for the believer for 2,000
[1:12:43] years what church ages is everybody with
[1:12:46] me for 2,000 years he'd been back there
[1:12:50] a lamb now he's stepping forth from
[1:12:54] eternity

[1:12:58] book right and to break the
[1:13:03] seals right and reveal the Mysteries
[1:13:08] when of it at the end time amen that's
[1:13:12] right do you get it I'll say it again at
[1:13:14] the end
[1:13:17] time all right we'll go on then now
[1:13:20] break the seals and release all the
[1:13:24] Mysteries to
[1:13:26] them all right to the seventh angel
[1:13:29] whose message is to reveal all the
[1:13:31] mysteries of God the mysteries of God
[1:13:34] lays in these Seven
[1:13:37] Seals see that's what he said here all
[1:13:41] the Mysteries lays in these Seven
[1:13:44] Seals excuse me and the lamb comes forth
[1:13:47] now from being a mediator between God
[1:13:50] and man all right the
[1:13:52] lamb right right he now becomes a lion
[1:13:57] right a lion of the tribe of Judah come

[1:14:12] becomes a line he takes the book that's
[1:14:15] his
[1:14:17] rights remember he bought us the rights
[1:14:21] yes amen he's the one that bought our
[1:14:24] Redemption right
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:28] nobody but now the lamb comes nobody
[1:14:31] could take the book it's still in the
[1:14:33] hands of God no Pope priest whatever it
[1:14:35] might be they can't take no the book The
[1:14:38] Seven Seals hasn't been revealed see but
[1:14:41] when the mediator when his work is done
[1:14:44] as an intercessor he comes forth and
[1:14:46] John the Elder said he's a lion he comes
[1:14:50] forth so what is he doing now he's got
[1:14:52] the book brother R said 2000 00 years
[1:14:56] he's had the book amen I'm going read it
[1:14:59] again right 2,000 years nobody could

[1:15:04] priest all the Mysteries laid in the
[1:15:07] seals there be the release when this
[1:15:09] only the seventh
[1:15:11] angel only the seventh angel is this
[1:15:14] released to all
[1:15:16] right and we're recipients of that
[1:15:18] seventh angel that's right cuz we are
[1:15:20] the voice we hear the voice and become
[1:15:23] the voice yes right everybody with
[1:15:28] me
[1:15:30] so one he's to turn the hearts of the
[1:15:32] children to the
[1:15:34] fathers help us realize we've been born
[1:15:37] again and we still got some extra to
[1:15:40] do amen right we still got some extra
[1:15:45] yes cuz this thing's got to be
[1:15:48] open somewhere between Revelations 5 and
[1:15:51] Revelations 10:7 the book got open
[1:15:56] but then who showed up
[1:16:00] John John showed up in this whole
[1:16:03] scenario right so two now watch the
[1:16:06] second part and then we'll we'll close
[1:16:07] right after we get done with this two he
[1:16:09] will reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:16:11] Thunders not in the first part not in
[1:16:15] Revelations 5 never Revelations 5 is
[1:16:17] your Redemption right no
[1:16:21] doubt but there's more to it than that
[1:16:24] we got to defeat the devil
[1:16:28] on I guess y'all don't want
[1:16:31] to this ought to excite
[1:16:34] you it's ought to make you happy that
[1:16:36] this is happening to you not somebody
[1:16:38] else you amen he will reveal the
[1:16:41] mysteries of the seven Thunders the only
[1:16:43] way he can do it is what with an open
[1:16:44] book right that's why brother B always
[1:16:47] refers to Malachi 4 and Revelations
[1:16:51] 10:7 amen cuz he said according back
[1:16:54] over here I'll read it one more
[1:17:02] time now this m of Malachi 4 and
[1:17:05] Revelations 10:7 he's putting the two
[1:17:08] scriptures as part of his ministry one
[1:17:11] is going to what it's like I said it's
[1:17:12] going to show the Redemption of the
[1:17:16] people how it's done then two the
[1:17:19] Mysteries are going to be
[1:17:20] revealed which are the revelations
[1:17:22] contained in the Seven Seals it will be
[1:17:25] these divinely revealed the only way it
[1:17:26] can be divinely revealed is when if
[1:17:28] Christ reveals
[1:17:30] it it's why we had to have a prophet a
[1:17:33] conduit that Christ could speak through
[1:17:35] that's right all right everybody with me
[1:17:38] reveal these mystery truths that
[1:17:40] literally literally turn the hearts of
[1:17:42] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:17:44] in other words literally changes your
[1:17:46] body
[1:17:48] right so now let's read this for a
[1:17:51] second and then we'll hear Brother Brown
[1:17:52] comment a few times and we'll close
[1:17:55] Revelations 10:1 and I saw another
[1:17:57] Mighty Angel come down from heaven I
[1:17:59] like the way God hides that cuz it said
[1:18:01] another another Mighty Angel and that's
[1:18:02] a little a you wouldn't think that was
[1:18:04] Christ you think CU listen there's
[1:18:06] angels all through Revelations a man
[1:18:09] another Angel come down another Angel
[1:18:11] spoke
[1:18:13] amen but brother R said only Christ is
[1:18:16] is and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:18:19] down from heaven you know why he said
[1:18:21] that cuz look Revelations one tells you
[1:18:24] who the that
[1:18:26] is he's clothed with a cloud Rainbow on
[1:18:29] his head face with his a son feet his
[1:18:32] pillows of
[1:18:34] fire but he had something in his
[1:18:37] hand he had in his hand a little book
[1:18:40] open amen right and he set his right
[1:18:44] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[1:18:47] the
[1:18:48] Earth what was he doing he was taking
[1:18:51] possession he was taking possession
[1:18:55] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:18:57] lion roar remember he was a lamb now
[1:19:00] he's coming over here to be the lion
[1:19:02] because remember what does a prophet do
[1:19:05] a prophet brings you and I the
[1:19:09] truth and eternal life and Redemption
[1:19:12] but what does it do to the people that
[1:19:14] rejects
[1:19:15] him
[1:19:17] right it seals him away in a different
[1:19:20] group they turn him away
[1:19:24] so this is Judgment a prophet brings
[1:19:27] judgment because brother Brown threw the
[1:19:29] thing up he said judgment will strike
[1:19:30] the West
[1:19:32] Coast why didn't Billy Graham do that
[1:19:36] why didn't or Roberts do
[1:19:38] that wasn't for them to do it it took a
[1:19:41] prophet to do that the voice of God to
[1:19:45] do that and he cried with a loud voice
[1:19:47] as when a lion Roth and when he had
[1:19:48] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:19:50] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[1:19:53] uttered their voices I was about to
[1:19:55] write all right we're going to stick
[1:19:57] something in here real quick because
[1:19:59] we'll cover them in just a little bit
[1:20:00] later on in the service sermon he was
[1:20:03] about to write what he saw so there was
[1:20:06] something there for him to
[1:20:08] write amen everybody with me it wasn't
[1:20:11] seven people it wasn't seven voices of
[1:20:15] seven men that was a that was a
[1:20:17] doctorine a long time ago well guess
[1:20:19] what all them seven men are passed away
[1:20:22] amen so that voice is silence right
[1:20:25] don't put it on a man let Christ do it
[1:20:29] amen but John was about to write it and
[1:20:31] I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto
[1:20:33] me seal up those things which the seven
[1:20:37] Thunders uttered and write them
[1:20:41] not we'll get into what brother Bram
[1:20:43] says about that a little bit later no it
[1:20:44] not tonight and the angel which I saw
[1:20:47] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:20:49] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[1:20:52] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[1:20:55] created heaven who you talking
[1:20:58] about and the things that they are in
[1:21:00] the earth things that they're in the sea
[1:21:02] things that they're in that there should
[1:21:04] be time no longer
[1:21:08] right you and I don't have a
[1:21:11] time you and I don't have a time Israel
[1:21:15] has a time this same scene is in the
[1:21:17] Book of
[1:21:19] Daniel but it's seen by Daniel which is
[1:21:22] a Jew given to the Jew and it says time
[1:21:25] times and dividing of times they have
[1:21:27] three and a half years you and I have
[1:21:29] had 60s something years of ministry from
[1:21:31] brother brandham or longer
[1:21:34] 70 amen right it's about time for time
[1:21:38] to be
[1:21:40] over all right so John says but in the
[1:21:42] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:21:44] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:21:46] of God should be finished as he has
[1:21:48] declared to his servants the prophets
[1:21:50] and the voice which I heard now this is
[1:21:52] John who I John is
[1:21:55] ey right all right now don't get up and
[1:22:02] leave he's not talking about that
[1:22:04] seventh angel
[1:22:07] anymore come
[1:22:10] on you with
[1:22:12] me brother Dell told us a long time ago
[1:22:16] John inserted that
[1:22:18] in knowing that the seventh angel when
[1:22:20] he was writing all that other stuff
[1:22:21] about I don't say stuff but all those
[1:22:23] other uh
[1:22:25] First Church age down to number seven he

[1:30:27] never known that either amen John knew
[1:30:31] he would see him because he was going to
[1:30:32] introduce him and we realize that in the
[1:30:34] scripture over in Malachi 4 there's to
[1:30:36] be one like John and Elijah to whom the
[1:30:38] word of God can come to and he's to
[1:30:41] reveal by the holy spirit all the
[1:30:42] mysteries of God and restore the faith
[1:30:45] of the children back to the faith of the
[1:30:47] apostolic
[1:30:48] fathers now watch this read then we'll
[1:30:50] close musicians come on
[1:30:55] musician come
[1:30:57] on now watch real close now watch this
[1:31:00] is a prophet now he said this is
[1:31:03] something you must get everybody with me
[1:31:08] are you awake and paying
[1:31:10] attention this is something you must get
[1:31:15] now he had been doing his mediatorial
[1:31:16] work making intercession for the
[1:31:17] believer for 2,000 years he' been back
[1:31:22] there a lamb
[1:31:24] period right now brother R says now he's
[1:31:30] stepping forth from eternity to take the
[1:31:32] title deed book and to break the seals
[1:31:35] and reveal the Mysteries when of it at
[1:31:38] the end time do you get it all right
[1:31:41] we'll go on then now break the seals
[1:31:44] release the Mysteries to the seventh
[1:31:45] angel whose message is to reveal all the
[1:31:48] mysteries of God the mysteries of God
[1:31:51] lays in those Seven Seals that's what
[1:31:54] what he said here all the Mysteries lays
[1:31:55] in the seals and the lamb comes forth
[1:31:58] now from being a mediator between God
[1:32:00] and man he become a line and when he
[1:32:02] become a line he takes the book that's
[1:32:04] his rights God held it the mystery but
[1:32:07] now the lamb comes nobody could take the
[1:32:11] book it was still in the hands of God no
[1:32:13] Pope priest whatever it might be they
[1:32:16] can't take the book The Seven Seals
[1:32:18] hadn't been revealed but when the
[1:32:20] mediator when his work is done as an
[1:32:21] intercessory comes forth and jump the
[1:32:24] Elder said he's a line and he comes
[1:32:27] forth he heard the noise of a thunder
[1:32:29] this is the first seal and one of the
[1:32:31] Beast said now come and see in other
[1:32:33] words here stands the lamb and John
[1:32:36] standing out there watching it happen
[1:32:38] and the lamb comes up from the throne
[1:32:40] like he'd been slain blood all over him
[1:32:42] he was the one that was found worthy and
[1:32:44] when he reached over and took the book
[1:32:46] then everything began to shout and
[1:32:47] scream carrying on because they knew
[1:32:50] Redemption was paid for he continues
[1:32:55] on he talks about the White
[1:32:58] Horse He said all that sounds good cuz
[1:33:01] this is the teacher said that it was the
[1:33:02] Holy Ghost conquering in the first age
[1:33:05] but my revelation of it by the holy
[1:33:06] spirit is not that way my Revelation by
[1:33:09] the holy spirit is Christ and the Holy
[1:33:11] Spirit is the same person only in a
[1:33:13] different form so here stands Christ the
[1:33:15] lamb we know he was the lamb he's
[1:33:18] standing here with the books in his hand
[1:33:20] and there goes the white horse rider see
[1:33:22] it wasn't the Holy Spirit now that's one
[1:33:24] of the Mysteries of the last day how
[1:33:26] that Christ can be three persons in one
[1:33:28] it's not three different persons and he
[1:33:29] continues on and tells them talks to the
[1:33:32] people so now and how could Christ be
[1:33:34] out there on in other words with a white
[1:33:36] horse conquering and standing here with
[1:33:38] the book in his
[1:33:39] hand It Isn't So it isn't
[1:33:42] Christ notice the holy spirit in
[1:33:45] Revelation the holy spirit is Christ in
[1:33:47] another form notice it is a lamb that
[1:33:50] opened the book and the lamb is Christ
[1:33:52] and Christ has not seen anymore from
[1:33:54] then but he has seen in the Book of
[1:33:56] Revelations coming on a white
[1:34:00] horse we'll stop right there let's
[1:34:05] stand so what are we getting into we're
[1:34:07] getting in a transition to
[1:34:10] where absolutely there was a time when
[1:34:12] brother brandham preached the mighty
[1:34:14] conqueror was that white horse rider not
[1:34:17] knowing that it was the Devil Himself
[1:34:20] but when Christ come and said all right
[1:34:22] this is your job you got you're the one
[1:34:25] here to open these seals I'm going to
[1:34:27] show you in the Bible this is what you
[1:34:28] got to do and when he saw
[1:34:32] that that's why he said he said I don't
[1:34:34] know what the second seal is on the end
[1:34:36] of the second seal he said I don't know
[1:34:38] what that third seal is he had come to
[1:34:40] the conclusion that he was just going to
[1:34:42] wait on
[1:34:43] God and let God bring the truth to him
[1:34:47] and then you know what we don't go
[1:34:48] backwards from there we go
[1:34:50] forward we go forward in Revelation you
[1:34:53] can't go backwards in Revelation you got
[1:34:55] to go
[1:34:56] forward I want to ask you a question
[1:34:58] tonight do you know that
[1:35:01] lamb do you know that lamb do you know
[1:35:03] it's so sure that we'll read it later on
[1:35:05] where brother brandham says in another
[1:35:07] quote he says here stands a lamb with a
[1:35:09] book in his hand and there goes the
[1:35:10] white horse rider here he was
[1:35:12] identifying the lamb was there cuz he
[1:35:14] said the lamb could only open the seals
[1:35:16] so brother Rand couldn't open
[1:35:18] them that's why he said I've never
[1:35:20] worked in this kind of Realm before why
[1:35:22] God was so close like he'd never been
[1:35:24] before and brother R knew that when he
[1:35:27] would look at that scripture and the
[1:35:29] angel would say something and he'd look
[1:35:30] and he'd say that was not what I was
[1:35:33] thinking so he knew right then that God
[1:35:35] was going to give him the perfect and
[1:35:37] divine interpretation of the word for
[1:35:40] who not the people sitting there cuz
[1:35:42] he's going to say that on the questions
[1:35:44] and answers it's for a group of people
[1:35:47] coming you and I are that group of
[1:35:49] people amen that this is all the
[1:35:52] fighting and fussing and arguing and all
[1:35:53] this this and that it's

[1:39:51] one any ailment anybody's ever had is in
[1:39:56] that sixth Dimension right now not one
[1:39:59] it never passed through and went into
[1:40:02] that sixth Dimension it stayed right
[1:40:05] here but I don't know about that Fifth
[1:40:09] Dimension weeping wailing nashing their
[1:40:11] teeth brother R said it had no it had no
[1:40:15] um Foundation you felt like you were
[1:40:17] falling what a horrible place to
[1:40:19] be but I'll promise you everything you
[1:40:22] say oh my brother died of this and my
[1:40:24] sister died of this and my you know that
[1:40:26] died of
[1:40:28] this it ain't over there prise Lord it
[1:40:32] ain't over there at
[1:40:34] all it stays right here so now what if
[1:40:37] we bring a little bit of that here it's
[1:40:40] going to shed off and L brother R said
[1:40:43] he said death going to come up your
[1:40:44] sleeve everybody I don't care who you
[1:40:47] are when you say death you have this
[1:40:49] little twinge of fear
[1:40:51] hello I don't care old or young we are
[1:40:55] we all have that one like today you know

[1:41:10] eat better sure I can walk I can run I
[1:41:12] can I can quit eating fried
[1:41:15] chicken maybe and but there's nothing I
[1:41:19] can do to take that away but you you're
[1:41:22] the only one that can sustain my
[1:41:25] life now if we start believing it like
[1:41:27] that even when we have to go to the
[1:41:28] doctor and we don't feel good say God
[1:41:30] you're the sustainer you're the one that
[1:41:34] can and I told those doctors that were
