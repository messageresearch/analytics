[0:00] God bless you Saints good
[0:05] morning we sure enjoyed the service
[0:08] yesterday and looking for more this
[0:10] today um I want to continue our journey
[0:13] through the book of um First Corinthians
[0:17] and looking at um chapter
[0:20] 4 um and I just took a one of the things
[0:23] Paul will saying in that in that chapter
[0:25] is judging nothing before the time so
[0:28] just uh maybe frame things up around
[0:31] that um let's go to the Lord in prayer
[0:34] Lord God we're so grateful for your word
[0:36] that You' given un to us in this hour to
[0:38] give us understanding and confidence
[0:39] Lord I pray God that Lord as we've come
[0:41] with expecting Hearts today Lord Jesus
[0:43] you'll give us what we have need of Lord
[0:46] help us Lord that you'll give us
[0:47] something to help and I pray God that as
[0:49] we walk through these scriptures Lord
[0:51] you'll guide us Lord we can read the
[0:53] words Lord but it takes the Holy Spirit
[0:54] to put it together and put the true
[0:56] essence of the meaning together and lift
[0:57] it off the page I pray God that you'll
[1:00] do that for us this morning be with us
[1:02] we pray as we give give everything that
[1:05] give the service to you Lord we pray in
[1:06] your name
[1:09] amen oh and that says second Corinthians
[1:12] but that's a typo I just noticed it so
[1:15] it says in verse five just to backtrack
[1:17] a little bit he saying who then is Paul
[1:19] and who is Apollos but ministers by whom
[1:21] you believed even as the lord gave to
[1:23] every man I have planted Apollos watered
[1:27] but God gave the increase so then
[1:29] neither is he the that planteth anything
[1:30] neither he that WTH but God that giveth
[1:33] the increase now really to frame up
[1:36] where Paul's going he's saying you know
[1:38] don't look at men look at the word but
[1:40] he's he's leading us to where he he's
[1:43] going to get to that statement follow me
[1:45] is also I follow Christ so it's kind of
[1:48] it's kind of odd he's he's really
[1:50] hammering don't look at the man look at
[1:52] the word but then then he leads up to
[1:55] follow me as also I follow Christ what
[1:57] what Paul I thought you were just saying
[1:59] don't look at a man but he's he's he's
[2:02] framing things up to say look you don't
[2:05] you we're supposed to live a life of of
[2:08] sacrifice and humility where we're we're
[2:11] not trying to get people to look at us
[2:12] we're trying to trying to guide them to
[2:15] to Christ and so he's saying he's
[2:17] framing it up as we follow the
[2:19] progression along that it's all about
[2:21] Jesus Christ so you know look he's
[2:24] saying look you look at my life as a
[2:26] template of what a Christian should be
[2:28] being lowered in a basket over the wall
[2:30] sacrific and being ready to die for for
[2:32] the what he believes and all of those
[2:34] kind of things but really it's it's all
[2:36] about Jesus Christ not about any
[2:39] particular man so he's saying Apollos
[2:42] watered and and I planted but but it's
[2:44] it's really God that it that is doing
[2:46] everything behind the scenes uh so now
[2:49] he that planteth and he that WTH are one
[2:51] and every man shall receive his own
[2:53] reward according to his own labor and
[2:55] then verse n he says for we are laborers
[2:58] together with God
[3:00] for year God's husbandry in other words
[3:03] it's like a it's like a plant that God
[3:04] is is is constantly tending and and he's
[3:07] and he's got ministers to trim and and
[3:11] and fertilize and do all the things to
[3:13] make sure that it's growing up and and
[3:14] then and then he says you're God's
[3:16] Building according to the grace of God
[3:18] which is given unto me as a wise master
[3:20] builder I've laid the foundation and as
[3:23] we looked at uh the last time I was
[3:25] speaking he he literally laid the
[3:27] foundation of of of all the things that
[3:30] we're we're we're preaching even now is
[3:33] because he he laid the foundation in the
[3:34] very first church age and that like that
[3:38] Faith Foundation of Ephesus that the
[3:40] whole building is built upon I've laid
[3:43] the foundation and another build their
[3:45] own but let every man take heed how he
[3:47] builth thereupon for other Foundation
[3:49] can no man lay than that is laid which
[3:52] is Jesus Christ now that's something to
[3:56] think about that that you know as we're
[3:58] as we're preaching the word and as we're
[3:59] laboring and and doing things for Christ
[4:02] that you know you can kind of get off
[4:03] the off the track so to speak and and
[4:06] start laying Things based on your own
[4:08] opinion and based on your own desires
[4:10] and based on your own motives and
[4:12] objectives and then those things will be
[4:14] wrong and and then later on you know the
[4:17] the the fire the test of life will come
[4:20] along and anything that's not laid
[4:22] correctly will actually be consumed and
[4:25] and Paul's laying out here in the the
[4:27] next few scriptures you you you'll still
[4:29] have have your salvation if you don't
[4:31] build correctly but anything that's
[4:33] built with the wrong motives and the
[4:34] wrong objectives the the fires and the
[4:36] testings of life and things will consume
[4:39] it until at the end if you all the
[4:41] things that are not built correctly will
[4:43] be consumed and and and and be eaten up
[4:46] so he said now in verse 12 he said now
[4:48] if any man build upon this Foundation
[4:50] gold silver precious stones wood hay
[4:53] stubble Every Man's work shall be made
[4:56] manifest for the day shall declare it
[5:00] so you know wood and hay and stubble are
[5:02] things that are easily it's easy to
[5:05] catch it on
[5:06] fire the fire of Life the the testing
[5:09] time comes and and it just burns up
[5:11] until you know you you you you out in
[5:13] the yard and you burn leaves and and
[5:14] after you're done there's nothing left
[5:17] and and that's what if you don't if you
[5:18] don't build things right with the right
[5:21] motives and the right and building upon
[5:23] uh uh the revelation of Jesus Christ
[5:25] then it it will not it will not stand
[5:28] the testing time Every Man's work shall
[5:31] be made manifest for the days shall
[5:32] declare it because it shall be revealed
[5:34] by fire and the fire shall try every
[5:37] man's work of what sort it is if any
[5:40] man's work abide which he hath built
[5:42] there upon he shall receive reward what
[5:44] kind of rewards maybe you frame it up
[5:46] like this recognition honor
[5:49] responsibilities uh integrity and and
[5:51] and and and people admiring the the
[5:53] stand that you take for the gospel and
[5:55] looking to you like Paul and saying well
[5:58] he's the kind of the Temple that I would
[6:00] want to frame my life after I want to I
[6:02] want to follow somebody like him because
[6:04] I believe that he's following Jesus
[6:05] Christ but if any man's work shall be
[6:08] burned he shall suffer loss but he
[6:10] himself shall be saved yet so is by fire
[6:14] so if we were to frame that up maybe
[6:15] another way if any man's work is burned
[6:17] up by the test he'll suffer the loss of
[6:19] his reward yet he himself will be saved
[6:22] but only as one who has barely escaped
[6:25] through fire so gold and silver and
[6:28] precious stones represent works of
[6:30] Eternal value done with the right
[6:32] motives in obedience to God's Will and
[6:35] for his glory and wood and hay and
[6:38] stubble represent works of lesser or no
[6:40] Eternal value actions driven by selfish
[6:44] motives just trying to get some money or
[6:46] trying to get some popularity or
[6:48] something like that Disobedience or
[6:50] temporal priorities all of those things
[6:52] will just be consumed and will have no
[6:54] lasting value oh but what has lasting
[6:57] value is the word of God and if we build
[6:59] life and built our but if we frame our
[7:02] try to frame our character and
[7:04] everything that's about us upon the word
[7:05] of God then that will last forever that
[7:08] will last forever so Paul's he's framing
[7:11] out he said know know you not that ye
[7:13] are the temple of God and that the
[7:16] spirit of God dwelleth in you if any man
[7:20] defile the temple of God him shall God
[7:23] destroy for the temple of God is Holy
[7:26] which Temple ye are now he's he's
[7:28] framing it up in the next chapter he's
[7:30] he's fixing to start whooping them for
[7:33] uh for not caring about that brother in
[7:36] that that's committing fornication so
[7:38] he's he's like don't you realize that
[7:41] your temple now now really think about
[7:44] this that if you really recognize that
[7:46] your body is is is is where God is
[7:50] dwelling then that it's it's like a call
[7:53] to live in a manner worthy of hosting
[7:56] the divine presence that our whole life
[7:58] should be frame AED up to be in in
[8:01] Holiness to live a holy life to not to
[8:04] not look at things that you shouldn't do
[8:06] to not to not eat like watching things
[8:09] that or you know giving your time to
[8:11] things that are not holy because to
[8:14] think now that God is tabernacling in
[8:17] you that he's living in
[8:19] you and and so you know uh I've got the
[8:22] little note here Believers as temples
[8:24] are also considered to be a holy
[8:26] priesthood tasked with offering
[8:28] spiritual sacrifice is acceptable go to
[8:31] God which involves ongoing worship and
[8:34] dedication to God so if you're a holy
[8:36] priesthood you're going to be offering
[8:38] sacrifices you're going to be
[8:39] sacrificing your time in prayer and
[8:41] study and you're going to be sacrificing
[8:43] sacrificing your uh your
[8:46] uh you know when you get up on the
[8:49] morning and sun on Sunday and you don't
[8:50] feel so much like rolling out of the bed
[8:53] and getting getting to church on maybe
[8:55] on Wednesday night but because you're a
[8:57] you're a holy priesthood you're
[8:59] sacrificing yourself and you're like I'm
[9:01] I'm laying down my own will and I'm
[9:03] going to do what uh what what God's word
[9:07] requires and all of this is framed up in
[9:09] the fact that that you are temple of God
[9:12] that God is God is tabernacling in you
[9:15] or or wants to at least and so that
[9:18] frames up everything that that you
[9:20] should uh we should live our lives in a
[9:23] manner that is worthy of Hosting God in
[9:27] our in our vessel
[9:30] and then he said know you not that you
[9:32] are the temple of God and the spirit of
[9:33] God dwelleth in you if any man defile
[9:35] the temple of God so what defilement
[9:37] means that that you know if you if you
[9:39] start going down that wrong path of
[9:42] giving your mind to things that are not
[9:44] right uh of of neglecting your prayer
[9:47] and your your a holy life then it starts
[9:50] lead it's like you know I've got this
[9:51] little picture here of of a temple where
[9:54] it just starts getting overgrown and
[9:57] moth starts taking over and dirt after a
[10:00] while it it it's like it doesn't look
[10:02] holy anymore so defilement will lead it
[10:06] leads to spiritual separation right or a
[10:10] loss of the divine presence and
[10:13] blessings you start you start acting
[10:15] wrong and doing wrong and and not
[10:17] studying and not not giving yourself to
[10:20] God and slowly things the world starts
[10:23] creeping in until you get more further
[10:25] and further away from God and and and
[10:28] and and you know you you you don't feel
[10:31] his presence anymore and oh if you're in
[10:34] that state this morning maybe it's time
[10:36] to change time to time to get get things
[10:40] a little bit cleaned up like Jesus went
[10:41] into the temple platted the rope and
[10:44] went in there and began to he said you
[10:46] my my temple is supposed to be holy and
[10:49] and you know if that Temple was supposed
[10:50] to be holy how much more your temple
[10:53] your temple is supposed to be holy and
[10:55] cleaned up and not given to like what
[10:57] Paul's getting to and not given to
[11:00] fornication and not given to the the
[11:02] filth of the world and all of those
[11:04] things don't let any of those things
[11:07] come into or have an influence over your
[11:10] temple which is supposed to be set apart
[11:12] for
[11:13] God and then and so he keep going on he
[11:16] said therefore let no man glory in
[11:18] men for all things are yours whether
[11:22] Paul or Apollos or sephus now now this
[11:25] is kind of what Paul Peter was saying
[11:27] some of the things Paul says is kind of
[11:28] hard to understand
[11:30] all things are yours elaborate on that
[11:33] Paul Paul didn't he just says it real
[11:35] quick throws it out there and and you to
[11:38] to make you think sit on it and think
[11:40] about it let no man glory in men for all
[11:44] things are yours and now what that means
[11:46] is he's admonishing the Corinthians to
[11:48] stop boasting about or exalting their
[11:50] human
[11:51] leaders because all things are yours
[11:53] because he's saying that Believers have
[11:56] this immense spiritual inheritance in
[11:59] Christ Christ that everything that God
[12:00] has provided is for your benefit but if
[12:03] you're looking at the person instead of
[12:06] the word then you're losing sight of all
[12:08] those benefits that you have access to
[12:11] right whether Paul or Apollos or sephus
[12:13] or the world or life or death or present
[12:16] or things present or things to come all
[12:18] are yours eternal life the benefits that
[12:22] David talked about in Psalms healing and
[12:25] salvation and all those things but you
[12:27] get so wound up on on following a person
[12:29] person looking at the person in other
[12:31] word well to frame it up like this if
[12:33] you if you start getting your identity
[12:35] for from a man instead of from the word
[12:38] of God then that's where you get off
[12:39] base and you are Christ and Christ is
[12:43] God's so let no man glory in men for all
[12:46] things are yours now that's that's kind
[12:48] of profound if you really sit and think
[12:50] about that all things are yours
[12:54] everything everything this Bible talks
[12:55] about from Genesis to Revelation like
[12:58] like brother Brandon was was just saying
[12:59] in that sermon we were listening to it's
[13:01] already paid for so if you need healing
[13:03] it's already paid for now that's what
[13:05] Paul's expressing here all things are
[13:07] yours so if you need healing or
[13:08] salvation or a refreshing of the of the
[13:12] spirit of God in your life this morning
[13:13] it's already paid for and it's available
[13:15] for
[13:18] you so going on to 1 Corinthians chapter
[13:22] 4 let a man so count of us as of the
[13:25] Ministers of Christ and stewards of the
[13:28] Mysteries of
[13:30] God moreover it is required in stewards
[13:33] that a man be found faithful but with me
[13:36] it is a very small thing that I should
[13:38] be judged of you or of M man's judgment
[13:42] yay I judge not my own
[13:48] self to be found faithful he's talking
[13:51] about a minister should be found
[13:52] faithful means stay true to the gospel
[13:54] and consistently teaching and living out
[13:56] God's word and serve with integrity and
[13:59] dedication to God not for personal gain
[14:01] or recognition and all those things but
[14:03] he's saying now now look I I I can have
[14:05] my own opinion about
[14:07] myself now now this this is where every
[14:10] one of us in this building kind of it it
[14:13] we struggle with this because every one
[14:16] of us when we evaluate ourselves we have
[14:19] this tendency to say well I'm I'm good I
[14:22] I'm the one that's doing it right I I'm
[14:25] I'm the one that's behaving correctly or
[14:27] what it's the other guy that's that's
[14:29] got the fault but what's Paul saying
[14:32] he's taking this real humble approach
[14:34] with me it is a very small thing that I
[14:36] should be judged of you or of man's
[14:38] judgment he's saying I I don't even
[14:41] judge my own self what's our judge our
[14:44] judge is not our own opinion or our own
[14:46] our own uh uh uh how how we think of
[14:49] ourselves but you got to take everything
[14:51] back to the word of God that's
[14:54] right look what he's saying he said I
[14:57] want to be found faithful I I don't want
[14:59] to compromise or distort the word or I
[15:01] want to constantly consistently teach
[15:04] and and serve with integrity and
[15:06] dedication and give my life lay down my
[15:08] life but but the the ultimate metric of
[15:11] your success is not our own opinion
[15:15] because if I just look at my own opinion
[15:17] I'm I'm doing pretty good but but when
[15:20] you know when you come to church it's it
[15:22] or when you look into the Bible you're
[15:23] holding up your life to the mirror of
[15:25] God's word and that's where a lot of
[15:28] times we'll go oh
[15:29] me oh oh my right you hold up yourself
[15:33] to the word of God like like Paul is
[15:36] doing to the Corinthians He he'll say
[15:38] later on you're all puffed up you're
[15:40] arrogant in your mind because you think
[15:42] you think that you're doing good you
[15:45] think and he would say when dealing with
[15:47] this man that's committing fornication
[15:48] you're all puffed up because you think
[15:51] that you're right to allow this man just
[15:53] to continue doing his thing and living
[15:56] wrong but but yet they're not evaluating
[16:00] themselves by the word of God so he's
[16:02] holding the word of God up to them and
[16:04] saying look look what you're doing look
[16:06] at yourself now that's that's that's
[16:09] when things get real is when we look
[16:10] into the word of God and say wow I'm not
[16:13] measuring up the way that I thought I
[16:16] was so he's saying in verse four he says
[16:19] for I know nothing by
[16:20] myself I I I don't know anything by
[16:23] myself just looking at my own self by my
[16:25] own opinion or what I think what I think
[16:27] I am yet am I I not hereby Justified but
[16:31] he that judgeth me is the Lord right so
[16:35] true
[16:36] justification comes from God not from
[16:41] self-perception or human
[16:44] opinions now now this is we're getting
[16:46] into the thought of Judge not before the
[16:49] time because we can be so quick maybe to
[16:52] judge our own s or so quick to judge
[16:55] somebody else right when you don't
[16:57] really see the hidden motive
[16:59] and what's really down underneath the
[17:02] covers sometimes you know we can look at
[17:04] we can see the reaction of someone's
[17:07] spirit or their flesh their actions but
[17:10] to really uncover what someone's real
[17:12] motives are and what their what's really
[17:15] down
[17:16] underneath sometimes takes
[17:21] time so the truth of the matter is God
[17:23] gets to say if it's good or bad if it
[17:26] passes the test or if it fails the test
[17:28] and he always judges by the
[17:32] word God will bring to light so in verse
[17:36] 5 he says therefore judge nothing before
[17:38] the time until the Lord come who both
[17:41] will bring to light the hidden things of
[17:43] darkness and will make manifest the
[17:45] counsels of the hearts and then shall
[17:48] every man have Praise of God so in other
[17:51] words God will bring to light hidden
[17:53] things and intentions of the heart now
[17:56] if if you notice that he's he's timeing
[17:58] it to the to the Lord's coming because
[18:01] the coming of the Lord is actually
[18:03] associated with the revealing of all
[18:05] these
[18:05] things the revealing of uh like how
[18:09] would without the Seven Seals being
[18:11] revealed how would you really be able to
[18:14] differentiate or know the difference
[18:16] between that Antichrist Spirit and the
[18:18] real the real genuine lion Spirit it
[18:21] begins to reveal things so that you can
[18:24] really see the difference so the
[18:26] revelation of hidden things is
[18:28] intricately connected to the Lord's
[18:30] return this is when what is hidden in
[18:32] darkness will be brought to light and
[18:34] the true intentions or counsels of
[18:37] Hearts will be man manifest in another
[18:40] word we call it man we sing that song
[18:41] manifesting time so therefore judge
[18:44] nothing before the time until the Lord
[18:48] come what what what what do we take away
[18:50] from this that human
[18:52] judgment is inherently flawed due to our
[18:55] limited understanding right now that's
[18:58] the thing that we all battle with I I
[19:00] think I got it all figured out but 90
[19:02] time nine times out of 10 we don't I
[19:05] think I got it all figured out what
[19:07] what's going on don't make Hasty
[19:09] conclusions about right and wrong based
[19:12] on superficial appearances right true
[19:15] understanding or judgment is revealed in
[19:17] God's timing and through spiritual
[19:19] maturity Guided by the Holy Spirit now
[19:22] now that that's a lesson for even
[19:25] understanding scripture like brother
[19:27] Brandon when he was preaching the seals
[19:28] he said it's gone from you you don't
[19:31] understand it and and he and then you we
[19:32] struggle I'm I'm going to do it I'm I'm
[19:34] going to figure it out but you you can't
[19:37] there's a time and a season you just
[19:38] wait you wait and God will reveal things
[19:42] in his time so therefore judge nothing
[19:45] before the time until the Lord come and
[19:47] then he'll bring hidden things of
[19:49] darkness and manifest
[19:51] everything some truths or judgment are
[19:54] only comprehensible when revealed by God
[19:56] highlighting the importance of waiting
[19:58] for for divine Insight just wait so
[20:02] we're not here to judge the man but but
[20:04] we are here to hold each other
[20:05] accountable to the word so what what we
[20:08] take away from this is to maintain
[20:10] patience avoid premature
[20:13] judgments and live lives aligned with
[20:16] the word nurturing the wisdom to discern
[20:19] Beyond superficial appearances and
[20:22] actions right now you see Paul's taking
[20:25] this approach when he's dealing with the
[20:27] Corinthians he he calls them his
[20:29] brothers he calls them Christian yet
[20:30] they're dealing doing things they
[20:31] shouldn't be doing you you you you you
[20:34] you're he's not just throwing them out
[20:36] saying well you know that's a Judas or
[20:39] that's a that's an ananas or that
[20:41] whatever you know label putting those
[20:42] labels on those hateful labels but just
[20:46] just wait maintain patience avoid
[20:48] premature judgments and then he's
[20:50] dealing with them so that you know that
[20:53] that brother that he's dealing with that
[20:55] was committing fornication there in
[20:56] second Corinthians he straightens
[20:58] everything up the church straightens up
[21:00] the ones that are all puffed up they get
[21:02] realigned they get humble themselves and
[21:05] and everything fall aligns right back
[21:07] with the
[21:08] word in verse six he said in these
[21:11] things brother and I have an a figure
[21:12] transferred to myself and to Apollos in
[21:14] other words in a figure in another like
[21:16] an example I'm using myself and Apollos
[21:18] as an example for your sakes that you
[21:21] might learn in us not to think of men
[21:24] above that which is written that no one
[21:28] of you be puffed up for one against
[21:32] another believer should not Elevate any
[21:35] person including themselves beyond the
[21:38] guidance provided by scriptures amen now
[21:41] that's that's a real lesson in humility
[21:43] because we want to puff oursel up we
[21:46] want to elevate oursel up and be like
[21:48] I'm I'm right and you're wrong and and
[21:50] and and but but Philippians 2 chapter
[21:53] 2:3 says let's esteem other better than
[21:57] themselves
[21:59] that's that's getting on up to brotherly
[22:00] kindness where you can start placing
[22:02] yourself in the other person's shoes and
[22:05] look at them things from their
[22:07] perspective I think well if I was in
[22:09] their shoes I'd probably look at things
[22:11] a little bit
[22:12] different and and then we wouldn't be so
[22:15] quick to judge and put the other down
[22:17] right for who maketh thee to differ from
[22:20] one another and what hast thou that thou
[22:22] do not received I got this picture of
[22:23] the little baby because everything in
[22:26] life that you got you got from somebody
[22:30] and you come into this world naked and
[22:32] without nothing and and just hitting the
[22:36] ground the way you started off somebody
[22:38] had to give you a blanket somebody had
[22:40] to give you a little whack on the back
[22:41] to get you started everything that
[22:44] you've got you had to receive from
[22:46] somebody now if thou did receive it why
[22:49] do thou Glory as if thou Hast not
[22:51] received it so that that really puts us
[22:53] in a place doesn't it that that if you
[22:56] got the Holy Ghost it's not something
[22:57] you gave to yourself but you got it from
[22:59] God if if you got everything that you
[23:02] got you got from somebody else so that
[23:05] really puts us all on one common
[23:07] Baseline that not one of us is better
[23:10] than the other not one of us can get
[23:13] puffed up and Elevate ourselves and say
[23:15] well uh praise God look at me I I'm this
[23:19] or I'm that who maketh the to differ
[23:22] from one from another and what has thou
[23:24] that thou this receive so we're all
[23:27] different but I differences shouldn't
[23:29] lead to Pride we are all equally
[23:31] dependent on
[23:33] God we all got a place in the body of
[23:36] Christ where you know like like Paul
[23:38] would say in that one place he said
[23:40] there's diversities of gifts but the
[23:41] Same Spirit there are differences of
[23:43] administrations but the same Lord and
[23:45] diversities of operations but it's the
[23:47] same God which worketh all in all in one
[23:50] place he said there's helps in the body
[23:52] of Christ right that that some people
[23:54] are just better Cooks than others some
[23:57] people are better better help you can go
[24:00] some people can minister to somebody in
[24:01] a different way than others can and
[24:03] we've all got that special part in the
[24:06] body of Christ that we're meant to play
[24:09] and that's where we get our
[24:12] value now look what he said now in verse
[24:16] eight to really understand what Paul's
[24:18] saying here you got he's he being a
[24:20] little sarcastic he's like now now
[24:22] you're full now you're rich look at all
[24:25] this stuff y'all got and we could really
[24:27] apply that to our own life
[24:28] us us lay out ofans we got uh we driving
[24:32] these fancy cars and we could say well
[24:34] now you're R you're full now you're R
[24:36] look at all you got you have reigned as
[24:38] kings without
[24:40] us and I would to God you did reain that
[24:43] we also might rign with you because if
[24:45] if if the if the church is prospering
[24:48] and everybody's driving their big fancy
[24:49] cars and if Paul is here you can say
[24:52] well I I I I I I I would that you reain
[24:55] so that I I could rain with you but he's
[24:57] framing it up like
[24:59] what is a real Christian Life as we as
[25:01] we close here in just a moment a real
[25:04] Christian Life is humility and sacrifice
[25:07] and giving yourself to others not not
[25:10] building up wealth and popularity so
[25:12] everybody can look at you and say well
[25:13] wow I really admire that person as a and
[25:16] and so forth and so on but he said so he
[25:18] says now you are full now you are rich
[25:20] you have reigned as kings without us and
[25:22] I would to God you did Reign that we
[25:24] also might reign with you for I think
[25:26] that God has set forth us the apostles
[25:29] last as it were appointed to death for
[25:33] we are made a spectacle under the world
[25:35] and angels and to Men We are fools for
[25:38] Christ's sake but you are wise in Christ
[25:41] we are weak but you are strong you are
[25:44] honorable but we are
[25:45] despised even under this present hour we
[25:48] both hunger and thirst and are naked and
[25:50] buffeted and have no certain dwelling
[25:52] place and labor working with our own
[25:54] hands being reviled we bless being
[25:56] persecuted we suffer it being defamed we
[25:59] entreat we are made as the filth of the
[26:01] world and are the offscouring of all
[26:04] things under this day I write not these
[26:06] things to shame you but as my beloved
[26:10] Sons I warn you for though you have
[26:12] 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have ye
[26:15] not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I
[26:18] have begotten you through the Holy Ghost
[26:21] through the through the
[26:22] gospel what's he saying true leadership
[26:25] and Spiritual Authority come through
[26:27] humility and sacrifice not Earthly
[26:30] success or
[26:32] recognition all all the things that the
[26:34] apostles went through hunger and thirst
[26:36] and persecution show their commitment to
[26:38] Christ and their Reliance on God so
[26:40] Paul's challenging the Corinthians to
[26:42] move beyond their current
[26:44] immaturity and and you'll find as he's
[26:46] laying this out and in all of Paul's
[26:48] writings that suffering is linked to
[26:52] character development and spiritual
[26:54] maturity what's he trying to express to
[26:57] the Corinthians I I want to see some
[26:59] character right you know Mar in that
[27:01] sermon marriage and divorce that we shy
[27:03] away from brother randam said God wants
[27:05] to see character it's about character
[27:08] amen and we'll just stop on that note
[27:11] God bless you Saints am
[27:16] [Applause]
