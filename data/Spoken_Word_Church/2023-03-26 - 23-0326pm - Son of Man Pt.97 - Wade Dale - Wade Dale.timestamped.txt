[26:15] God's going to speak to you today it
[26:17] becomes my light
[26:19] for you to listen
[26:21] to the word of God do these ministers
[26:24] that's the only way we're going to get
[26:25] it through the foolishness of preaching
[26:28] are we going to get out of here
[26:31] because that's what God promised he said
[26:33] he gave some Apostles prophets pastors
[26:35] teachers and evangelists for what
[26:36] perfecting of the Saints not to get you
[26:39] just a little bit no to perfect you
[26:42] and that we all come together
[26:44] in the unity of the faith how are we
[26:46] going to know what the unity is if
[26:48] somebody doesn't tell us because Satan
[26:51] will give you his version of unity the
[26:52] Baptist will give their use you know you
[26:54] know their version of unity and and the
[26:57] world to give you uh you know the world
[26:59] United now under whatever you want to be
[27:03] rainbow
[27:04] you choose it you know you don't even
[27:07] have to choose your gender until you're
[27:09] five or six years old you know and then
[27:11] you decide who you are how weird is that
[27:14] Sodom and Gomorrah
[27:16] all over again
[27:20] just debauchery on every hand
[27:24] felt to the world
[27:26] but you know what we used to be a
[27:27] religious Nation
[27:29] the prophet of God told us in 1956
[27:32] that the United States turned God down
[27:36] so he doesn't even pray for the United
[27:37] States anymore
[27:41] that's what he said
[27:42] I pray for the people in it
[27:45] and the people that are they're getting
[27:46] caught up in this system of of
[27:50] what's going on in the world the
[27:52] politics and all the things you see the
[27:54] wars and rumors of wars but didn't the
[27:55] Bible tell us this is what was going to
[27:57] happen
[27:58] it's not something that we uh many times
[28:02] before I've told you you go talk to
[28:04] people out in the world even a nominal
[28:07] Christian they don't exactly know what's
[28:10] going on
[28:11] they think maybe this is the Antichrist
[28:13] or the number uh tattoo or or we're
[28:17] going to have seven years of tribulation
[28:18] or like um
[28:20] like Sister Christine back there you
[28:23] know they put that movie out
[28:24] um Left Behind well now there's left
[28:26] behind two how you gonna get left behind
[28:28] twice
[28:30] I mean what
[28:33] I mean how are they gonna happen how I
[28:35] ain't going to get left behind the first
[28:36] time so they ain't gonna worry about
[28:38] that but the world will they'll be
[28:40] deceived and fooled and they'll get left
[28:42] behind and they'll still think brother
[28:43] Brown said he said they'll still think
[28:45] they're getting saved that anointing
[28:47] will be so strong from the devil until
[28:49] the people will think they're still
[28:51] getting healed they're still getting
[28:52] saved and he said too late then
[28:55] right so let's go to the lord well let's

[29:00] way oh if whatever we're doing what

[30:46] no it might be God speaking to you

[30:55] Lord thank you for this time you give us
[30:56] thank you for this day that we're living
[30:58] in thank you for the word of God thank
[31:00] you for giving us even a chance
[31:03] just a chance
[31:06] to have eternal life just an opportunity
[31:09] for us then to have this message
[31:13] placed in our laps
[31:16] the greatest message since the Lord
[31:18] Jesus you sell yourself came on the
[31:20] Earth
[31:21] he's laying in our laps today and Father
[31:23] what are we going to do with it
[31:25] are we going to let it just slip through
[31:28] our fingers that sand
[31:30] are we going to hang on to it
[31:32] hold on to it
[31:34] pour it in ourself
[31:36] so that we can be more like you
[31:39] this world
[31:41] from the beginning of time has been
[31:43] waiting
[31:44] on that Adam and Eve condition before
[31:47] the fall
[31:48] where there is complete control
[31:51] with a human being
[31:54] with their soul
[31:57] eternal
[31:58] and there be no sin well that's what
[32:00] we're heading to
[32:01] and the plan that you give us seemed
[32:03] like it was marred and seemed like it
[32:05] was you were going to have to go back to
[32:07] the drawing board as they say but no
[32:10] everything falls right into place
[32:12] because Lord your plan and purpose is
[32:14] perfect
[32:15] you knew what you were doing
[32:17] now Lord you continue to know what
[32:19] you're doing you've not lost any you've
[32:21] not lost anything you'll not lose anyone
[32:23] father everything that's part of this
[32:26] plan you saw before the foundation of
[32:28] the world by foreknowledge and you saw
[32:30] us even right here today
[32:32] standing right here today at this very
[32:35] moment you saw this in your mind just as
[32:37] Vivid as as it's happening right now
[32:41] and Lord I pray that you be well pleased
[32:44] with us here today in the hearers and
[32:48] the speakers father
[32:49] I pray that you just blessed this one
[32:51] Lord that's on the highways a lot of
[32:53] them are coming back today brother Aaron
[32:55] Brother Bob brother boys and brother
[32:59] um Gary in different ones lord they're
[33:00] traveling back brother Michael all those

[33:04] Carolina Lord I pray this should be with
[33:06] them Lord on the highways bring them
[33:08] back together Lord in you father be with
[33:11] the ones that are sick
[33:12] Lord sister Freedom there when her
[33:14] kidneys hurt and Lord we stopped and
[33:15] prayed their middle uh one o'clock or
[33:18] whatever it was Lord I pray that you
[33:19] would just bless her
[33:21] Lord just rained down blessings upon our
[33:24] sister and father may she feel like it
[33:27] and just feel absolutely wet with the
[33:30] saturation of the Holy Ghost Lord that
[33:33] rain that falls that sometimes we feel
[33:35] it ourself even that little tingle that
[33:38] feeling of of beautiful raindrops
[33:41] falling on our head Lord that's the
[33:43] healing power of the Lord Jesus
[33:45] Lord I pray that you'd be with every one
[33:47] of the other ones that are sick too not
[33:49] leaving anyone out that we'll all get
[33:51] the blessing Lord even the ones here in
[33:52] the building today Father rejuvenate us
[33:55] Lord there's times Lord that we feel
[33:58] sometimes sure enough about not wanting
[34:00] to get out of bed to do anything but
[34:03] father we get up and when we put our
[34:05] feet on the floor we say thank you Lord
[34:09] we put our feet on the floor and as the
[34:11] prophet of God says many times I've I've
[34:14] chuckled when he says when you put when
[34:17] a Believer puts their feet on the floor
[34:20] all devils in Hell tremble well
[34:23] sometimes we don't feel like that Lord
[34:24] when we're first getting out of bed we
[34:27] feel like that we can't move a muscle
[34:29] but fathers somewhere deep down inside
[34:32] that inside of the inside man there's
[34:35] something going on
[34:37] in a supernatural world that surely the
[34:40] demons are shaken
[34:42] and Lord I pray
[34:44] that each one of us
[34:47] will have that anointing today to drive
[34:50] that demon of whatever it is
[34:53] away from us and completely out of the
[34:55] building
[34:56] father give us this day our daily bread
[34:57] and be with us in Jesus name
[35:00] amen amen yeah I kind of chuckle
[35:02] sometimes when you get out of bed you
[35:03] put your feet on the floor and you go oh
[35:05] man
[35:07] all devils in hell are trembling
[35:09] I can't hardly get out of bed but I'm
[35:12] going to believe what that Prophet said
[35:13] in a supernatural Realm we're waking up
[35:19] and he's not gone boys and girls he's
[35:22] right there with us
[35:24] so I just want him to know next time you
[35:26] put your feet on the ground say Satan
[35:28] here I come
[35:30] this is how you're going to be defeated
[35:33] whether I look like it or not
[35:35] amen
[35:37] he's defeated he's already defeated
[35:39] how's he going to be defeated through
[35:40] the Bride of Jesus Christ so let's start
[35:43] here again now this is part 97 we're
[35:45] heading toward 100. in the beginning was
[35:47] the word word with God and the Word was
[35:49] God and that word was made flesh and
[35:51] dwelt Among Us on behold his glory
[35:53] the glory the only begotten of the
[35:55] father
[35:56] full of grace
[35:58] and Truth II Peter 1 and besides this
[36:01] giving all diligence
[36:03] add to your faith virtue
[36:05] and to virtue of knowledge
[36:08] into knowledge temperance
[36:10] and to Temperance patience
[36:12] and to patience
[36:14] godliness
[36:16] I hope we get to that today in your
[36:18] patience Luke says this is Jesus telling
[36:21] us in your patience possess you your
[36:23] souls you know somebody's in control is
[36:25] patient
[36:27] somebody's in control is patient because
[36:30] you we go Haywire that's not being
[36:32] patient and usually what happens we goof
[36:35] up we do like brother Brown we go out
[36:37] past the plan of God or we all we even
[36:39] go out go out to pass the plan of us our
[36:42] day like brother Johnny I mean we go out
[36:44] and say oh man I shouldn't have done
[36:45] that you know well
[36:47] there's a do-over you can do over you're
[36:49] good we just back up
[36:51] and and let's remember that that how
[36:54] many times have you we were talking
[36:56] about crock pots and microwave you know
[36:58] you go into the house and
[37:00] and uh we used to and even when we hunt
[37:02] we like to put uh potatoes and carrots
[37:05] and roast in a crock pot turn it on low
[37:09] and then go out and do our business and
[37:11] hunt and do whatever and then when we
[37:12] come back oh the smell oh it smells so
[37:15] good well that thing's been cooking the
[37:17] whole time
[37:18] but then you get some you look in the
[37:20] potatoes are a little bit hard what's
[37:22] the first thing you do throw them in the
[37:23] microwave
[37:24] well that's the same way with us we want
[37:26] to have a religion that is a crock pot
[37:28] religion but sometimes we look over and
[37:31] we see it microwave sitting over there
[37:32] and we like to throw stuff in it
[37:34] and what happens if you put something in
[37:36] a microwave and get it too hot it
[37:38] explodes and you have a mess everywhere
[37:43] amen and most time your sisters have to
[37:45] clean it up
[37:46] First Timothy 3 16 says and without
[37:49] controversy great is the mystery of
[37:52] godliness God was manifest In the Flesh
[37:55] right now
[37:57] justified in the spirit right now
[38:00] scene of angels you saw I can't see but
[38:02] you know what they can it says scene of
[38:04] angels it doesn't say it's the angels
[38:07] so the angels that are encamped about us
[38:09] today they're looking into this
[38:11] Dimension seeing us
[38:13] and they're going come on we can't do
[38:16] anything without you
[38:18] we're just standing here at attention
[38:19] you know you you you ask and we'll come
[38:23] preached unto the Gentiles happening
[38:25] right now believed on in the world right
[38:28] now received up into Glory we're heading
[38:31] in that direction a man you can be
[38:33] seated in the Lord has blessing to the
[38:35] reading of the word
[38:36] we were talking this morning about the
[38:38] plan and purpose of God I want you to
[38:39] understand there's no other way that's
[38:41] what I was getting trying to get in my
[38:43] head the other day there's no other way
[38:45] we cannot start
[38:47] and and have our own plan the plan's got
[38:50] to be the plan and purpose of God and
[38:53] man until and I just say this boldly
[38:56] until the prophet of God came in this
[38:58] end time
[39:00] man did not know the complete plan of
[39:02] God they did not know the complete Plan
[39:05] of Redemption or maybe they had a
[39:07] thought of it or they thought this was
[39:09] right or they thought that was right
[39:11] they thought father son Holy Ghost was
[39:13] the way to be baptized they thought that
[39:15] there was an eternal hell they thought
[39:17] that there was three gods or three
[39:19] persons in a godhead they thought all
[39:21] these things but when the prophet of God
[39:23] come he brought that plan and purpose of
[39:26] God and he says this is it
[39:28] and you know what God Vindicated that it
[39:30] was it there's no other
[39:32] there's nothing other than this
[39:35] you said boy that's real bold I listen I
[39:38] staked my soul on this right here
[39:43] you say yeah
[39:45] I do
[39:46] he brought me to Christ and brought more
[39:49] then the denominations brought me then
[39:52] the world brought me then the different
[39:54] ones that had their ideas brought me the
[39:57] prophet of God brought I don't care if
[39:59] he didn't do what they said he did and
[40:01] he was not in Arizona and he didn't
[40:02] shoot this and he didn't kill that I
[40:05] don't care
[40:07] he took us to God Amen and he took the
[40:11] plant brought the right plan here on to
[40:14] us
[40:15] not to the world
[40:17] it's to us today
[40:21] it's not to the world it could be
[40:24] listen it could be we're not we're not
[40:27] exclusive God says we're exclusive
[40:31] God says if you're my bride this is what
[40:34] you're going to get it's like we were
[40:35] talking about this morning there's a
[40:37] group inside of a group there's groups
[40:39] inside of groups because listen Paul
[40:42] even stands up one day and he says not
[40:44] all Israel is Israel
[40:46] not all bride is Brad
[40:48] brother Brown said there's been Brides
[40:50] brides churches Brides churches and he
[40:52] makes this long
[40:54] uh sentence about that he said but
[40:56] they'll come one
[40:57] one
[40:59] true bride that will not get out of line
[41:02] she will stand step she will catch the
[41:05] mind of God see that's why I believe
[41:08] that's what brother Ram's job was he was
[41:10] to bring us and and give us the mind of
[41:13] God and then we decide whether we take
[41:15] it or not
[41:16] that's what he was doing to the
[41:17] denominational world he said here this
[41:19] is the truth I'm not going to shove it
[41:21] down your throat but I'm bringing you
[41:24] the truth God's vindicating it every
[41:25] night by giving us signs and wonders and
[41:28] if you don't take it I can't make you
[41:31] that's right I think I have a quote in
[41:33] here or maybe for later where Brad Brown
[41:36] says since I've come here every year
[41:39] said you Pentecostal women you still cut
[41:41] your hair you still wear makeup you
[41:44] still wear pants he said it's not doing
[41:46] you he said it's doing something good
[41:48] but it's not doing what what brother
[41:50] Brown
[41:51] and I've always said this brother Brown
[41:53] did not destroy one denomination
[41:56] as much as he preached against them as
[41:59] much as he told them they were of the
[42:00] Harlot system they ain't a what
[42:03] said okay we don't want to be Baptist no
[42:05] more we're just going to completely do
[42:06] away with that denomination we're all
[42:08] going to be message Believers no what
[42:10] there was 969 when he was here there's
[42:13] 13
[42:14] 000 different denominations in the world
[42:16] now so guess what Satan just kept on
[42:19] going
[42:20] but there's a group of people
[42:23] there's a group of people inside a group
[42:25] of people
[42:26] that's gonna take this message as the
[42:29] prophet says and sweep it onto the
[42:31] coming of the Lord that's going to what
[42:33] that's going to walk with God and be not
[42:35] one day
[42:37] but you're not going to do it we're not
[42:38] going to do it halfway
[42:43] amen
[42:45] that's just a plan I'm sorry I didn't
[42:47] make it I'm just here to enforce it
[42:50] right that's what we are we're not here
[42:52] we're like deacons deacons don't make
[42:54] the rules they enforce the rules
[42:56] so that's why we're here we're here not
[42:58] to make the rules but to enforce them
[43:00] to give them to you and you know what
[43:01] there's a wasp speeding out here right
[43:04] now right there's a law of drinking
[43:07] alcohol and if you drink you know if you
[43:08] DUI or drink while you're driving right
[43:12] did that stop people from doing it
[43:15] courts are full of people
[43:17] dead drink and drive that drive over the
[43:20] speed limit it hasn't stopped anything
[43:22] but it has stopped the ones that it
[43:24] needs to stop
[43:26] and those of us that don't drink doesn't
[43:28] matter anyway
[43:30] amen
[43:31] if you ever worried about a DUI Law
[43:33] being changed
[43:35] why
[43:37] don't reply to you
[43:39] same way with these things in the Bible
[43:41] we can do away with a lot of our
[43:43] problems if we'll get into this not make
[43:45] it a law
[43:47] but make it Grace
[43:49] hello somebody come on I don't worry
[43:52] about whether they're passing laws
[43:54] whether I can drink and two beers now
[43:56] instead of four or or why
[44:01] oh lord they're gonna start closing the
[44:03] beer joints at 10 o'clock oh my word so
[44:06] what y'all to close them in
[44:08] damn
[44:12] does that bother you it shouldn't bother
[44:14] you
[44:15] please like this Impala no shouldn't
[44:18] bother people around the world but it
[44:19] does because why do they make the law
[44:21] cause there's somebody there listen this
[44:23] is kind of funny but if you look on
[44:25] these things that you buy especially
[44:26] lawn mowers
[44:28] you buy a lawnmower and there's a little
[44:30] thing right down here with a man with
[44:33] his hand in the blade
[44:36] right that says do not put your hand
[44:39] right here guess why that sticker's
[44:42] there
[44:43] some man put his hand underneath there
[44:46] while it was going
[44:49] very soon
[44:52] right
[44:53] because somebody did it
[44:56] well that's why God's got things in the
[44:58] Bible because he knows people are going
[44:59] to do it
[45:00] but he's also going to know there's
[45:02] people that won't ever do it
[45:04] amen so that's why I take Grace I see
[45:06] that I see the law part of it but but
[45:08] brother brownston preached the sermon
[45:10] Church choosing law for Grace they chose
[45:12] the law when they should have took all
[45:14] this as Grace because the grace to me is
[45:16] though if I do
[45:18] I'm not going to ask how many he's had a
[45:20] speeding ticket
[45:23] in the past several months I haven't but
[45:26] but if you did then you get Grace why
[45:28] you have to go pay a penalty though
[45:30] I mean you have to pay a fine but there
[45:33] is Grace there they don't just take you
[45:34] out and hang you on hang up in a tree no
[45:37] there's a law that covers that same way
[45:40] in the Bible there's Grace that covers
[45:42] you if you do something wrong
[45:45] because Christians do things wrong sorry
[45:49] to let you all in on that
[45:51] if you got a problem send the email to
[45:53] Sister Barbara
[45:54] Jesus died
[45:58] saved those who God for knew
[46:00] I do
[46:02] and let me give you a little let me give
[46:04] you a little um
[46:06] a little snippet here that that helps me
[46:08] a lot because a lot of people confuse
[46:10] that when you talk about foreknowledge
[46:12] predestination and the message is it's
[46:15] like even brother Brown he said you know
[46:16] what he said predestination is a bad
[46:18] word to use well it's still a bad word
[46:20] to use if you don't know what you're
[46:21] doing
[46:22] all right you've got to make it by
[46:24] foreknowledge the Bible says those who
[46:27] he fore knew he did predestinate so what
[46:28] comes first for knowledge he foreknew
[46:32] therefore he could predetermine that you
[46:34] were going to have a seed or a word that
[46:38] was put aside for you
[46:40] at the time of your new birth
[46:43] but not something you're gonna have from
[46:45] a time of your natural birth
[46:49] everybody with me
[46:51] but God for knew that so brother Brown
[46:53] could say in the mind of God if you if
[46:56] you have that eternal life you always
[46:58] was eternal not you that I'm looking at
[47:01] but you that's inside of you is what I'm
[47:04] looking at
[47:05] they never had a beginning around
[47:07] because if it had a beginning it will
[47:09] definitely have an end
[47:11] all right
[47:13] so to me foreknowledge is the most
[47:15] simple thing to explain but it's the
[47:18] most hard thing for people to understand
[47:20] so we we know one thing's for sure
[47:22] brother Dale's been preaching
[47:23] predestination that's probably one of
[47:24] his one of his favorite topics
[47:27] but it all comes before knowledge so
[47:29] four four
[47:32] no
[47:33] so those he foreknew he predestinated
[47:37] so he could see what's going on and he'd
[47:39] say the choice you made
[47:42] good or bad he saw the choice you made
[47:44] and he saw he even saw you never make
[47:48] another one
[47:49] because see you can't he can't see us
[47:52] choose to have eternal life and he
[47:53] imparted to us and then see that on down
[47:56] the road even brother Brown said God's
[47:57] not an Indian giver
[47:58] he's not going to give you the baptism
[48:00] of the Holy Ghost and then you're gonna
[48:01] mess up so bad he's gonna take it away
[48:03] from you
[48:04] that's why he says he said I think it's
[48:07] a church age book he said I want to
[48:08] settle this insecurity about security
[48:12] I believe in eternal security if you
[48:15] believe it like he believes it and I
[48:17] believe it but not like the Baptist
[48:19] believe it what saved always saved yeah
[48:22] I mean man you in the Baptist Church you
[48:24] shake a hand you give you know you make
[48:26] a decision they say and you don't have
[48:28] to go to church the rest of your life
[48:30] you can grant smoke cuss you can do
[48:31] whatever you want to do but now when
[48:33] they bury you
[48:35] you got it goes back you know
[48:38] 50 something years ago you
[48:40] made a decision
[48:44] well that's not true we know that
[48:46] but eternal security is is one saved
[48:49] always saved if you get born again
[48:51] you get born again you can't get unborn
[48:53] again
[48:54] you get born again you are what sealed
[48:57] to the day of your Redemption sealed to
[49:00] the day of your Redemption they're by
[49:01] with me on this
[49:03] I'm gonna keep you away God knew there
[49:05] was going to be somebody saved or he
[49:07] knew
[49:09] he foreknew
[49:14] therefore if you know what's going to
[49:16] happen tomorrow
[49:19] if you know for a fact
[49:22] let me tell you something else
[49:23] I hope the Rapture takes place on Sunday
[49:29] cause all the demons are getting ready
[49:31] for Monday
[49:32] and they're going I got him I'm gonna
[49:35] make that tire flat before they get them
[49:36] go to work I'm gonna make them late
[49:40] I'm gonna make them sick on Monday
[49:44] and we gonna be going
[49:48] later devil we gonna disappear before
[49:51] Monday happens
[49:53] hey man
[49:55] see y'all like Mondays I do not like
[49:57] Mondays
[49:59] Mondays at the post office is
[50:02] heck
[50:04] you've got two days worth of mail you
[50:06] got to deliver and two days worth of
[50:07] y'all's packages that y'all ordered
[50:09] basically they're on Herbert shakers
[50:10] Road
[50:11] several on herbal secrets that why I'm
[50:15] looking at now
[50:16] and that are not here
[50:20] but I Don't Like Mondays
[50:22] I just don't like them
[50:24] because if you you come out as today you
[50:27] got you got just a wonderful anointing
[50:29] you know and and we go downstairs or we
[50:31] go eat or we go talk about the word of
[50:34] the Lord and how good he was or good he
[50:36] was today and how good he is and then in
[50:38] the morning like I said you wake up your
[50:40] car won't start
[50:45] the alarm clock won't go off
[50:48] you're just late all week
[50:50] just messes everything up
[50:53] but let's make Sundays let's make
[50:55] Mondays Sundays now
[50:58] let's let's when we get up put our feet
[50:59] on the ground tomorrow let's just
[51:01] remember God is with us today as much as
[51:04] he was Sunday all right so you say that
[51:08] to yourself
[51:09] so there had to be
[51:13] there's a way or a plan that God has and
[51:16] what we have to do is is connect
[51:18] ourselves to that plan
[51:20] all right God's not going to make us
[51:22] enforce us but he's going to make it so
[51:25] available
[51:28] that we can accept it or reject it
[51:31] so available
[51:32] but he knows who's going to and who's
[51:34] not therefore his plan now look
[51:37] it's just like all over the board messed
[51:40] up
[51:41] we can go 100 different directions
[51:44] but God's plan is
[51:46] he's got one drawing and he knows
[51:48] exactly what's going on all the way down
[51:50] through here
[51:52] we don't
[51:54] but see so according to his plan and
[51:57] purpose he can do these things and he
[51:59] can tell you know he said well they're
[52:01] going to pray about this but they're not
[52:03] going to pray about so much about this
[52:04] they're going to go ahead and make this
[52:06] mistake God can't make you not make that
[52:08] mistake if he saw you make it to begin
[52:10] with
[52:11] right all right but he did see as
[52:13] brother Burns says many times he said he
[52:15] did say you get down on your knees and
[52:18] say God forgive me you know Satan comes
[52:19] up and says hey you see what they did
[52:21] hey you see what they did and the Lord
[52:24] says no I didn't see it but I can hear
[52:26] their voice
[52:27] that says forgive me Lord for what I'm
[52:30] doing
[52:32] look if there wasn't in other words
[52:34] there wasn't a plan salvation wasn't
[52:36] possible we can just go home eat drink
[52:38] and be merry so God for knowing that
[52:41] people would be saved let me say this
[52:43] too for knowing that we would want more
[52:46] that we would want more of God that we
[52:48] would want more than just coming to
[52:50] church reading our Bible that we would
[52:52] want to be the word made flesh
[52:55] amen
[52:56] knowing who they were he had to lay a
[52:59] plan down
[53:01] so now in order to be God he had to know
[53:04] who will do it or he wasn't God because
[53:06] he's omnipotent I'm the president
[53:08] omniscient he knows everything he's at
[53:10] every place all-powerful so for
[53:12] knowledge looks back and says that he
[53:14] foresaw this so he saw it
[53:17] and knows that's the reason he could
[53:20] tell what the end was from the beginning
[53:21] how could he write a Bible
[53:24] if he didn't know what the beginning was
[53:26] and didn't know what the end was
[53:28] right he wrote the Bible
[53:30] man didn't write it man pinned it
[53:34] right but he write it
[53:35] God wrote the Bible
[53:38] and knows that's the reason he could
[53:40] tell what the end was from the beginning
[53:41] and therefore knowing that all these
[53:43] marvelous days that we're living in now
[53:44] will stand to witness and see the things
[53:46] that we've seen now God had to make a
[53:48] preparation for it in other words Paul
[53:50] or Peter sits in in II Peter and he
[53:53] writes this and pins it to the church
[53:55] everybody with me all right stay with me
[53:57] for a minute he pins that to the church
[54:00] add to your faith virtue version
[54:02] knowledge and all this Temperance
[54:03] tempers patience in other words that you
[54:05] will be what in other words you'll be
[54:07] you'll be a complete person and then
[54:10] through the church ages though you see
[54:11] brother random hits he says he says a
[54:13] lot of that gets laid down
[54:16] because even Jude tells
[54:18] that we're to contend for that faith
[54:21] that was once delivered to the Saints so
[54:25] it hadn't been delivered
[54:27] even at Wesley's day even in Luther's
[54:29] day that Faith now Faith was delivered
[54:31] but not that one
[54:33] not that faith of the fathers the faith
[54:36] was delivered but like I said before I
[54:38] read it to you several times faith alone
[54:41] won't do it
[54:43] in the end time faith alone will not do
[54:46] it
[54:47] you can have all Faith Paul says no all
[54:50] Mysteries and not have what not have the
[54:53] Holy Ghost in your soul
[54:56] many people that are leaving the message
[54:58] are proving now
[54:59] they never had charity in their soul
[55:04] they never had the new birth you can't
[55:06] leave this message and have the new
[55:08] birth you can be confused
[55:11] but you can't leave this message and say
[55:13] it's no good that brother Brown was
[55:14] wrong that he's you know this and that
[55:16] and you can't do that
[55:18] you know what if you believe you can do
[55:20] that you're gonna get caught in too
[55:25] if you believe that
[55:26] you're gonna get caught in it too
[55:29] but if you've got charity
[55:34] you will not
[55:36] fall from this message
[55:38] you might fall down flat on your face
[55:40] and have and and make mistakes and sin
[55:45] but you'll never leave this message
[55:48] because this is
[55:51] the love of God
[55:52] to a group of people
[55:54] that don't even deserve it
[55:57] you deserve this message you need to hit
[56:00] the altar
[56:01] nope you don't deserve none of this
[56:07] think about that but God seeing that you
[56:10] wanted it more than your neighbor did
[56:11] why'd your neighbor not get it he didn't
[56:14] want us more as you as much as you did
[56:15] he saw you keep punching and keep
[56:18] punching keep going keep striving in
[56:20] other words like I said before
[56:22] this is the battle it's not picnic
[56:29] the purpose of the Holy Ghost the father
[56:31] God to Father dwelling in you working
[56:33] out his plans
[56:34] how many times you look up the word plan
[56:36] brother Adam talks about plan so God did
[56:38] have a plan and we got to get in that
[56:40] plan right we can't go around it we
[56:43] can't be where we say well I don't think
[56:46] that'll now how can you tell God I don't
[56:48] think that'll work
[56:53] it will work you just don't want to put
[56:55] yourself in it
[57:00] working out his plans to finish his Plan
[57:04] of Redemption working where through you
[57:07] making you a co-worker with him
[57:15] I wish you could see that
[57:18] co-worker with him
[57:20] heirs and Joint heirs with Christ
[57:22] whatever Christ gets you get
[57:24] the problem is is we maybe don't want a
[57:27] lot of the things that uh it costs too
[57:30] much
[57:31] for us to give up this part of our life
[57:35] Pride
[57:38] somebody had written down a piece I
[57:39] think something Deanna didn't be a pride
[57:41] and the Bible says pride comes before
[57:43] fall
[57:45] Pride we're too pradish
[57:48] we don't we don't we don't want to do
[57:51] exactly that
[57:52] I want to have some knowledge but I want
[57:54] my own
[57:57] listen
[57:58] yesterday or Friday
[58:01] when Micah and Esther got married
[58:04] she gave up everything she had
[58:08] she gave up her name she is not a black
[58:10] anymore
[58:13] she's not a pure woman anymore you
[58:16] understand what I'm talking about
[58:17] she's give herself completely to Micah
[58:21] laid everything on his shoulders
[58:24] and said you got to take care of me
[58:28] according to the holy vows
[58:32] sickness and
[58:34] good
[58:35] Good Times
[58:37] credit debt cash
[58:41] did y'all have any money fights
[58:44] oh come on now Alicia's just smiling and
[58:46] Don's going
[58:48] we all do
[58:50] we all do
[58:52] we all have money flies
[58:56] well
[58:57] I said well never mind let's keep going
[59:03] but I want you to see this this is what
[59:05] struck me because look
[59:07] do we have
[59:10] the Holy Ghost
[59:12] to hunt for lost souls
[59:15] you said brother what you're preaching
[59:16] on statute birth man that's above it
[59:18] well if we if we lose that that we're
[59:20] above
[59:22] trying to get people into them into to
[59:24] the fold or getting people born again
[59:25] we've lost
[59:28] the very foundation of the plan
[59:31] and we have to go back and reach back
[59:34] thank God he reached down and got me and
[59:36] you
[59:38] and now he's reaching back in case we
[59:40] are slipping and falling and by preach
[59:43] the foolishness of preaching he's trying
[59:44] to bring us all up at the same time
[59:45] we're not all going to come at the same
[59:47] time but you know what don't leave me
[59:50] behind Lord
[59:52] don't leave me behind but you got to
[59:54] make yourself available in the plan
[59:59] because what does Satan do he says well
[1:00:01] no that's not the plan here's the plan
[1:00:07] when it strikes into the heart and takes
[1:00:09] us Abode there's a thirst and a
[1:00:11] hungering for lost souls
[1:00:15] wow
[1:00:17] that's what's the matter with the
[1:00:19] meetings today there's not enough Spirit
[1:00:21] touch in it to go for the souls of the
[1:00:24] Lost and the dying it's more to make a
[1:00:26] name or a church or a building or a
[1:00:28] denomination instead of a soul-winning
[1:00:30] program how pitiful I hope this church
[1:00:34] never gets to where
[1:00:37] it's us for no more and we're done and I
[1:00:39] don't want no more in and I you know
[1:00:40] we're
[1:00:43] no that's why I pray for your kids my
[1:00:46] kids
[1:00:46] your spouses yeah
[1:00:50] your mom's your dads
[1:00:52] called their names all every night
[1:00:55] it may be redundant but I'm old
[1:00:58] and to keep from forgetting I have a
[1:01:00] list that I go by
[1:01:01] every night
[1:01:03] try not to forget anybody
[1:01:06] now God's secret mystery well I'm glad
[1:01:09] you said Thank you nobody else did
[1:01:12] I want to thank you all dad prays for us
[1:01:14] he gets up all night and praise mom too
[1:01:16] what brother what did Brother Dale tell
[1:01:18] brother Albert I said brother the hell I
[1:01:20] couldn't go to sleep last night he said
[1:01:21] so I prayed for you and he or he said I
[1:01:23] went and he went to sleep brother Dale
[1:01:25] said Lord wake him up let him pray for
[1:01:27] me again
[1:01:29] now back in the back part of God's mind
[1:01:31] there was something that he was trying
[1:01:33] and was going to achieve and he had a
[1:01:35] motive in doing it now what was his
[1:01:37] motive to bring us back to an eating
[1:01:39] condition now to bring us back to an
[1:01:41] eating condition what was Adam Adam was
[1:01:44] standing there
[1:01:46] the son of God
[1:01:50] but he was the first Adam he had these
[1:01:53] virtues
[1:01:57] in the head
[1:01:59] but he was missing a piece
[1:02:02] he wasn't a redeemer
[1:02:05] but he had headship over this Earth
[1:02:07] he controlled this whole earth and Eve
[1:02:11] was right there with him right
[1:02:12] so he had headship
[1:02:14] now see we don't have headship over this
[1:02:16] Earth we need to have headship over this
[1:02:18] one first
[1:02:19] all right but he had headship over the
[1:02:22] whole world I mean he could just go like
[1:02:23] brother bear said he'd go tree move over
[1:02:25] there I don't like you over there he
[1:02:27] said oh it's a little too cool today
[1:02:28] well let's turn it let's turn the heat
[1:02:30] up now how many of us have done that
[1:02:32] before yeah that's what I mean
[1:02:34] but that's what we're getting back to
[1:02:36] but that's what Adam was Adam was the
[1:02:39] ruler of this Earth he controlled every
[1:02:41] animal he controlled everything that
[1:02:44] happened on the face of the Earth and we
[1:02:47] lost that in the garden because of what
[1:02:49] happened and then when God withdrew
[1:02:51] itself from the earth that's when the
[1:02:54] fall happened
[1:02:59] and we're living in it ever since
[1:03:02] but there was something he was trying
[1:03:03] and going to achieve in order to let
[1:03:06] himself be expressed because first there
[1:03:09] wasn't a Moon Star Adam or anything he
[1:03:10] was God he was God but he actually look
[1:03:13] he is actually wasn't God at that time
[1:03:15] because John is not God is an object of
[1:03:17] worship there wasn't anything to worship
[1:03:19] him so what'd he do he wanted those
[1:03:21] attributes to be expressed and him was
[1:03:24] love and him was father and him was to
[1:03:26] be son savior healer and all those great
[1:03:29] attributes that we see look brother man
[1:03:31] brings it today that we see already
[1:03:34] expressed they were in God so he saw him
[1:03:37] expressed we see them expressed
[1:03:40] listen the mind of God when you walk in
[1:03:43] this world realize one thing's for sure
[1:03:46] you're the only person
[1:03:48] that's in their right mind
[1:03:52] you're the only person that's in the
[1:03:53] mind of God you're the only person he
[1:03:56] said oh no what about my brothers I said
[1:03:57] you better find out if you are
[1:04:01] it's all right to know that brother
[1:04:03] Donnie is or brother Louise says but I
[1:04:05] gotta know if I'm in the mind of God if
[1:04:08] I'm in the will of God
[1:04:13] so we got to have a deep call
[1:04:15] because if there's a deep call there's
[1:04:17] got to be a deep to respond if we're
[1:04:19] calling out for God he's got more to
[1:04:21] give us
[1:04:22] that's why with these virtues we've got
[1:04:24] to actually ask for them
[1:04:28] we're gonna ask for him
[1:04:31] how many how many of you have asked
[1:04:33] every time we go to a step God give me
[1:04:35] virtue
[1:04:37] that brother's explained to me as much
[1:04:39] as he can what virtue is now I want some
[1:04:41] of it amen
[1:04:43] knowledge I want knowledge I don't want
[1:04:46] knowledge to Puff it up
[1:04:48] because remember true Holy Ghost
[1:04:50] knowledge is a revelation which will
[1:04:51] drive you down
[1:04:53] amen
[1:04:56] amen there was something in there called
[1:04:58] out for more of God
[1:05:01] you might have been living in a
[1:05:03] Justified state but you wanted the
[1:05:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:07] that's why I believe in the steps folks
[1:05:09] if you can't put in your own life
[1:05:15] justification
[1:05:17] and when you move from justification and
[1:05:19] you move to sanctification
[1:05:22] and you knew God was doing something in
[1:05:23] your life that nobody ever done before
[1:05:26] you couldn't do it yourself
[1:05:28] listen you didn't want to do it
[1:05:31] the real you I mean it's not one it was
[1:05:33] in you that's that type not that that I
[1:05:35] didn't want to do it I didn't want to go
[1:05:37] to church
[1:05:40] oh bro I was born out of the womb going
[1:05:42] to church now you'd be born a liar
[1:05:50] that's why brother Brown
[1:05:52] always told us justification
[1:05:54] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:05:56] because you could be in a Justified
[1:05:57] condition but you got to know that
[1:06:00] you got to come to a realization that
[1:06:02] I've been Justified
[1:06:04] now Lord get that unclean Spirit out of
[1:06:08] me
[1:06:11] change my attitude give me a new spirit
[1:06:14] but it's not the Holy Spirit remember
[1:06:15] we've never been through all this it's a
[1:06:18] new spirit to get in contact with God
[1:06:21] and to make him what whatever I'm saying
[1:06:24] that he can get along with your spirit
[1:06:27] he said you can't even get along with
[1:06:29] yourself
[1:06:30] and that was me can there are times that
[1:06:33] you can get along with yourself not many
[1:06:35] will y'all pray for me oh y'all just
[1:06:37] smiling
[1:06:38] foreign
[1:06:42] with me but most time I can
[1:06:46] because there's always that
[1:06:48] little thing sitting here
[1:06:52] but I know the day I got Justified and
[1:06:55] the walk that took me through that
[1:06:58] and then I come to a Sanctified
[1:06:59] condition and the walk that I came
[1:07:01] through that
[1:07:03] amen I say me you gonna have listen this
[1:07:06] has been explained for 50 years
[1:07:09] that you didn't just come to this
[1:07:10] message and just drop into a seat and it
[1:07:12] all come poured down on top of you
[1:07:15] you had to come to a walk
[1:07:18] Crock-Pot
[1:07:21] Justified
[1:07:23] sanctified
[1:07:25] fill with the Holy Ghost finally you got
[1:07:27] something to eat
[1:07:29] finally you're cooking
[1:07:33] now the very reason that there is a holy
[1:07:35] spirit is because you were hungering for
[1:07:37] it
[1:07:38] the Bible says those that want hunger
[1:07:40] and thirst after righteousness shall be
[1:07:42] filled
[1:07:44] I know this is simple but we've got to
[1:07:46] get this down first amen before we can
[1:07:50] have any of this
[1:07:51] if we think we've got all these and all
[1:07:53] of a sudden like brother Brown says you
[1:07:55] you fall off right here
[1:07:58] Foundation becomes to crumble and have
[1:08:00] cracks in it
[1:08:02] but look what we're talking about this
[1:08:03] morning Eno walk with God there was no
[1:08:05] other nothing else
[1:08:07] it says about Enoch except he walked
[1:08:10] with God so he walked with God and and
[1:08:13] you know what it's kind of strange that
[1:08:16] Enoch built the Pyramid
[1:08:18] so ain't it builds the pyramid and now
[1:08:20] the pyramid is being used for all kind
[1:08:22] of things and even brother Branham comes
[1:08:24] out and when when when God tells him
[1:08:26] says go to II Peter
[1:08:28] write all them virtues down and then put
[1:08:31] them in a pyramid
[1:08:34] hey man put him in a pyramid
[1:08:38] there's Eno's walk
[1:08:41] that's Enoch's bricklaying ability right
[1:08:43] there we gotta have the same thing
[1:08:45] because what did it do with Enoch he not
[1:08:47] what was God and he was not
[1:08:49] for God took him it's the same way with
[1:08:52] me and you we're going to have to walk
[1:08:54] with God more and more every day
[1:08:58] or we're not gonna make it to the top
[1:09:00] all right
[1:09:01] these are the generations of Noah Noah
[1:09:03] was a just man and perfect in his
[1:09:04] generation and Noah walked with God and
[1:09:07] Noah and only a few people were saved
[1:09:09] during that time he preached 120 years
[1:09:12] boy talking about patience
[1:09:16] 120 years he said it was going to rain
[1:09:19] not one drop
[1:09:22] not one drop not one scientific note
[1:09:26] that says well maybe
[1:09:28] no because remember the ground was what
[1:09:30] watered from the
[1:09:32] from the ground
[1:09:33] brother Brown said not a cloud of the
[1:09:35] sky Gotta Have clouds have rain
[1:09:38] the brother Brown says look now we'll go
[1:09:40] let's go to Temperance we got to get to
[1:09:42] patience here real quick
[1:09:44] Temperance how to answer in kindness
[1:09:46] when wrath is spoken to you you know and
[1:09:49] and you all know me that I'm pretty
[1:09:51] quick on the tongue but I'm getting
[1:09:53] better
[1:09:55] because you know what I'm doing now I'm
[1:09:57] counting to 10 in my head before I say
[1:09:58] something
[1:10:00] sometimes
[1:10:03] sometimes one two sometimes one ten
[1:10:09] but in answering kindness with wrath is
[1:10:11] spoken to you
[1:10:12] how many times have we had to eat our
[1:10:14] words
[1:10:16] and those of you that are asleep your
[1:10:18] hands are being raised spiritually
[1:10:23] because we've all been quick on the
[1:10:25] trigger we've all been and what did it
[1:10:27] do most of the time
[1:10:29] pie in the face right
[1:10:31] most of the time it ain't gonna work out
[1:10:35] if you jump to conclusions
[1:10:37] so
[1:10:39] be patient
[1:10:40] that's why Temperance and patience works
[1:10:42] together
[1:10:43] all right
[1:10:44] but talk with Godly love Temperance
[1:10:47] kindness
[1:10:49] if you still blow up in SASS and fuss
[1:10:50] and stew and carry on you ain't got it
[1:10:52] it won't vulcanize anyone talked about
[1:10:55] vulcanization let's go to patience
[1:10:57] remember it's not in the Old Testament a
[1:10:59] man who has not swerved from his
[1:11:00] deliberate purpose now you see with
[1:11:02] patience you got to know what you're
[1:11:04] patient for though
[1:11:07] well I'm just patient patient for what
[1:11:10] patient that my kid will come to the
[1:11:13] Lord patient that my husband will come
[1:11:15] to the Lord see so there's something
[1:11:17] there's an end game to that patience I
[1:11:20] have patience for this God has patience
[1:11:24] for you because he knows you'll either
[1:11:26] come to this spot or you won't come to
[1:11:28] this spot he knows the world is going to
[1:11:30] be redeemed but there's a lot of things
[1:11:31] got to go through it but he's got it
[1:11:33] right here
[1:11:34] that's what he's looking at brother Rob
[1:11:37] said Abraham look at the promise not the
[1:11:40] circumstances
[1:11:41] if he would have wrote down in a diary
[1:11:43] for 25 years he'd never had that baby
[1:11:48] that's right he just said God promised
[1:11:51] it
[1:11:52] God's going to deliver it
[1:11:54] a man who has not swerved from his
[1:11:56] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[1:11:59] Faith and piety by even the greatest
[1:12:01] trials and sufferings
[1:12:04] patiently
[1:12:05] steadfast
[1:12:07] steadfast waiting for do you know Simeon
[1:12:10] Simeon was brother Adam said he was way
[1:12:13] up in his age in his 90s 80s or 90s you
[1:12:16] know who Simeon is right
[1:12:17] Simeon was promised by God he wouldn't
[1:12:20] die until he saw the Lord's Christ
[1:12:26] folks he waited his entire life
[1:12:31] for one promise
[1:12:34] entire life now he didn't just go over
[1:12:37] there and sit in the temple
[1:12:39] and get fat and eat Cheetos
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:44] I believe he went out looking for that
[1:12:47] every day
[1:12:50] because he knew that Messiah had to come
[1:12:54] waiting he said for the consolation of
[1:12:56] Israel and then one day what happened
[1:12:59] one day brother Brown said he felt
[1:13:01] something
[1:13:02] pick him up
[1:13:06] he felt something draw him
[1:13:08] as he said in that in the
[1:13:11] um
[1:13:11] 20th century prophet he said Drew him
[1:13:14] right to the fountain
[1:13:19] besides that day
[1:13:21] and here stands a little 16 year old
[1:13:23] girl or 17 year old girl with a brand
[1:13:24] new baby
[1:13:26] no different than any other baby he
[1:13:29] didn't look the Catholic Church puts
[1:13:30] this little halo around the baby there
[1:13:33] ain't no Halo there
[1:13:34] now he's God we know that
[1:13:36] but he didn't walk around with this
[1:13:38] little light all over him no he was hid
[1:13:41] he was hid in a crowd but what did God
[1:13:43] do he went and he went he said Simeon
[1:13:45] I'm fixing to show you the promise that
[1:13:47] I promised you years and years and years
[1:13:50] ago
[1:13:52] brother Brown said he felt the poem said
[1:13:54] he felt the pull got right up to
[1:13:57] the baby
[1:13:59] I said let me have him
[1:14:02] he said Lord let your servant depart in
[1:14:06] peace
[1:14:07] for I have seen the consolation
[1:14:10] of Israel
[1:14:11] in other words I have seen the Messiah
[1:14:15] I went through 80 something years of
[1:14:17] waiting on this promise just for one
[1:14:19] promise
[1:14:21] didn't make him note great I don't he
[1:14:23] wasn't a bishop or he wasn't the high
[1:14:26] priest for sure or he would have said he
[1:14:27] was no he was somebody that worked in
[1:14:30] the temple
[1:14:31] he did his job
[1:14:33] like brother Brown said a little wash
[1:14:34] woman going to work man with his lunch
[1:14:36] box under his arm is what God is looking
[1:14:39] for if they are yielded to him
[1:14:45] let's skip through here a little bit
[1:14:48] be not slothful but followers of them
[1:14:50] who through faith and patience inherent
[1:14:52] what the promises for when God made
[1:14:54] promise to Abraham because he could
[1:14:56] swear by no greater I was saying this
[1:14:58] morning he just raised his hand and said
[1:14:59] hey I'm gonna do it
[1:15:01] Abraham I know you're going to mess up I
[1:15:03] told you to go by yourself
[1:15:05] and here you take your cousin or
[1:15:07] whatever he was Matthew
[1:15:08] here I told you not to do that I told
[1:15:11] you don't go to Egypt he goes down to
[1:15:12] Egypt I told you not to do it
[1:15:15] God says I'll do it
[1:15:18] I'm gonna swear by myself I'm not
[1:15:20] swearing by Abraham I'm not swearing by
[1:15:22] Adam I'm swearing by myself now where is
[1:15:25] he today
[1:15:28] he wasn't in Abraham like he's in you
[1:15:30] right now right
[1:15:33] he was not in anybody in the Old
[1:15:36] Testament like he's in you right now all
[1:15:39] the great ones the Moses all the
[1:15:40] different ones they didn't have the Holy
[1:15:42] Ghost by the new birth they had a holy
[1:15:44] ghost anointing that way they could do
[1:15:47] what they did they killed somebody or or
[1:15:49] commit adultery
[1:15:51] and God just seemingly Let It Go but he
[1:15:53] didn't let it go like that
[1:15:55] but David if he had had Holy Ghost he'd
[1:15:57] never had his best friend killed he'd
[1:15:59] never committed adultery against his
[1:16:01] best friend amen
[1:16:03] but he had an anoint him
[1:16:05] you and I have the person dwelling
[1:16:07] inside of us
[1:16:09] in good times and bad times hey we're
[1:16:12] married to him just like that marriage
[1:16:13] vow says good or bad rich or Poor
[1:16:16] satanistan House
[1:16:19] brother Brown said one time and I'm
[1:16:20] gonna try to find out he said you ought
[1:16:22] to love God more when you're sick than
[1:16:24] you are when you're well
[1:16:26] because you know something's coming you
[1:16:29] know he's the Healer how could you be
[1:16:31] how can you know he was a Healer if you
[1:16:33] never got sick
[1:16:35] I've been so sick and I know y'all have
[1:16:37] two that she's you didn't even couldn't
[1:16:39] pray
[1:16:42] but you know what you do you just lay
[1:16:43] there and wait are you just stand there
[1:16:45] and wait or you just sit there and wait
[1:16:46] you just keep going just keep going keep
[1:16:48] going
[1:16:50] my brother encountered all joy
[1:16:54] I want y'all to call call me every time
[1:16:57] y'all getting a a problem I do once you
[1:17:00] call me you got my phone number but I
[1:17:02] want you to be laughing
[1:17:03] huh
[1:17:07] I want you to be praising God
[1:17:10] nothing negative now
[1:17:14] when you fall into many Temptations
[1:17:18] count it all joy
[1:17:24] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:17:27] face
[1:17:28] work his patience
[1:17:30] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:17:33] that you may be perfect and entire look
[1:17:36] wanting nothing
[1:17:38] got your perfect man you're beginning to
[1:17:40] reflect the works of Christ in other
[1:17:42] words we're getting up here into into
[1:17:43] patience but so many of us trying to do
[1:17:45] the works of Christ before the
[1:17:47] reflection of Christ is in us now
[1:17:49] there's the trouble we can find these
[1:17:51] things happening you know you know it
[1:17:53] you know what we see these stumbles
[1:17:55] along the road we find the scrap heaps
[1:17:56] of Ministers of Christians piled along
[1:17:59] the road is because they didn't go into
[1:18:01] it right and that's why I'm here this
[1:18:04] morning look brother Brown knew what he
[1:18:06] was here for
[1:18:08] he might have not have said I'm a
[1:18:10] prophet he knew he was a prophet deep
[1:18:11] down inside but he was here to teach the
[1:18:14] little church right right he was here to
[1:18:16] teach this little church and myself how
[1:18:18] that we can become the dwelling place of
[1:18:20] the Living God how many would like to be
[1:18:22] that
[1:18:23] II Peter 3 9 the Lord is not slight
[1:18:26] concerning his promises some men count
[1:18:27] slightness but it's long-suffering to us
[1:18:31] to Oxford not willing that any should
[1:18:33] perish but all should come to repentance
[1:18:36] James 5 verse 7 says be patient
[1:18:38] therefore Brethren unto the coming of
[1:18:40] the Lord behold the husband will waiteth
[1:18:43] for the precious fruit of the earth
[1:18:44] who's the precious fruit of the earth
[1:18:45] you and I are amen and hath long
[1:18:48] patience for it
[1:18:50] how about an eternal person
[1:18:54] waiting on us
[1:18:59] think about that an eternal person
[1:19:01] waiting
[1:19:02] an eternal person having patience
[1:19:06] but you know why it's because of us
[1:19:11] until he received the former or early
[1:19:13] and latter rain be ye also patient
[1:19:16] establish your hearts for the coming of
[1:19:18] the Lord drawth now let's continue on
[1:19:20] Statue of perfect man fourthly we want
[1:19:22] to add patience to your faith if you got
[1:19:25] faith it worketh patience the Bible said
[1:19:27] so this is patience that's the next
[1:19:29] thing going to build this stature God
[1:19:31] has to get real material in his building
[1:19:33] see how short we are brother and sister
[1:19:35] see why we're at
[1:19:37] yes sir see we have Glory we have shouts
[1:19:41] and things because we got faith and like
[1:19:44] I said before it's good to have special
[1:19:46] meetings and everybody get motivated and
[1:19:48] activated and we do shout out some and
[1:19:51] we do you know enjoy the glory of the
[1:19:54] Lord but it's like brother Donnie Reagan
[1:19:56] said he said that's a special meeting
[1:19:57] that's why that word special is in there
[1:20:00] because it's not every day you have a
[1:20:02] special meeting
[1:20:04] Wednesdays and Sundays Wednesdays and
[1:20:06] Sundays you're laboring the ox is
[1:20:08] laboring
[1:20:09] right and you're laboring
[1:20:12] not so much you you shouting speaking
[1:20:15] tongues or shout or even say Amen most
[1:20:17] time
[1:20:19] because but you got faith but look but
[1:20:21] you got faith but we have Glory we have
[1:20:22] shouts because we got faith but when we
[1:20:25] come down to these things here
[1:20:28] these things right here
[1:20:30] God can't build us into that stature
[1:20:35] see he can't he can't make us up to that
[1:20:38] kind of a place we got all these other
[1:20:41] things we fall slide off with it he
[1:20:45] can't build his church
[1:20:47] praise God he does build his church
[1:20:49] though
[1:20:51] but look faith alone won't do it this is
[1:20:53] kind of where we was at this morning El
[1:20:54] Shady eye brother Brown said that in
[1:20:55] Abraham we find out he didn't obey God
[1:20:58] just right now he made ready and had
[1:21:00] faith in the promise but see we can
[1:21:03] still have faith in the promise and not
[1:21:05] obey still it'll hinder us
[1:21:08] huh we can have faith we all have faith
[1:21:11] in the word of God if you're born again
[1:21:12] you got faith all right you have faith
[1:21:15] in the promise
[1:21:16] but sometimes we don't know bad
[1:21:19] I'm I'm reading what's in red
[1:21:23] look still it hinders us now you say I
[1:21:27] believe in the Holy Spirit I believe I
[1:21:29] should be baptized with the Holy Spirit
[1:21:31] now no matter how much you believe
[1:21:33] you've got to obey that Commission
[1:21:37] obey obey Commission
[1:21:40] just faith alone won't work because
[1:21:42] faith without works is dead that's right
[1:21:45] now when we think of words stop just a
[1:21:48] minute right when we think of words what
[1:21:49] do you think
[1:21:51] oh we gotta make sure that we we're on a
[1:21:53] serving line and we make sure that we
[1:21:55] take the trash out and we make sure that
[1:21:58] the pews get clean and we make sure that
[1:22:00] ain't work
[1:22:02] it works
[1:22:05] works is there right there
[1:22:08] that's having virtue for someone
[1:22:11] that's having knowledge to be able to
[1:22:13] help somebody to be able to sit around a
[1:22:15] table and some of us get together and
[1:22:17] and you know say well what about this
[1:22:20] I've always had a question about this
[1:22:21] and you answered the questioner or the
[1:22:23] question gets answered by somebody it
[1:22:25] doesn't really matter how the question
[1:22:26] gets answered
[1:22:29] I just want the correct answer to the
[1:22:31] question and the person that asked it I
[1:22:33] want them to be satisfied with it all
[1:22:35] right because faith without worse is
[1:22:38] dead so there's got to be worse behind
[1:22:40] that faith
[1:22:42] see you can't tell me something like I
[1:22:45] said this morning you can't tell me that
[1:22:47] somebody can sit in the message Pew for
[1:22:49] 30 years and then deny the whole message
[1:22:52] and say it's wrong
[1:22:53] that brother I was wrong he's just a
[1:22:55] false prophet
[1:22:56] how can you do that well that you can
[1:23:00] but you fall away there's no way to get
[1:23:02] back unless you repent and go back
[1:23:06] just like the borderline Believers got
[1:23:09] people today you find in the Bible it
[1:23:11] said for is impossible for those which
[1:23:13] are once enlightened here we go and made
[1:23:16] partakers of the Holy Ghost and fall
[1:23:18] away to renew themselves again unto
[1:23:19] repentance seeing that crucify to
[1:23:22] themselves the Son of God afresh and
[1:23:23] count the blood of the Covenant
[1:23:25] wherewith he was Sanctified and Unholy
[1:23:28] thing in other words what do you say it
[1:23:29] God's blood
[1:23:32] is not strong enough
[1:23:34] to do away with my problems that's what
[1:23:37] you're saying
[1:23:38] right
[1:23:39] that's what this person's saying
[1:23:44] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[1:23:46] Son of God afresh and count the blood of
[1:23:49] the Covenant wherewith he was Sanctified
[1:23:51] an Unholy thing and done despite to the
[1:23:55] works of Grace Hebrews 10 it says it's a
[1:23:58] fearful thing to fall in the hands of a
[1:23:59] living God and those people you've seen
[1:24:02] them come to church they'll come and
[1:24:04] they'll say oh I believe yes sir but
[1:24:06] they'll they believe it but they'll
[1:24:09] never lay their hands to it to turn one
[1:24:12] will to help it go on
[1:24:15] that's not serving in the child line
[1:24:17] that's not cooking the best
[1:24:20] squash casserole
[1:24:23] slaw
[1:24:24] that's good wonderful very credible
[1:24:28] extremely important
[1:24:30] to some of us
[1:24:32] but to God that's not works
[1:24:35] that's just being a good fellow human
[1:24:37] being a good Christian person
[1:24:40] look because he says look never lay
[1:24:42] their hands to it to turn one will to
[1:24:45] help it go on
[1:24:48] God I don't want to ever hinder somebody
[1:24:50] that's why I stay in the service you
[1:24:52] walk through that door you come up for
[1:24:54] prayer whatever it is if you're sitting
[1:24:56] back there you need to say God clean my
[1:24:58] sleep
[1:24:59] right
[1:25:00] clean my slate make sure I'm not the one
[1:25:03] who's gonna have to stand and say you're
[1:25:05] the one that calls this person to not
[1:25:06] get healing I don't want that
[1:25:09] but it's so simple to say God
[1:25:11] forgive me
[1:25:14] when we take communion
[1:25:16] listen when you take communion
[1:25:20] if you start and I know what the devil
[1:25:21] will do he's going to give you seven
[1:25:23] thousand reasons to not take it
[1:25:25] you did this
[1:25:28] I think sister I think sister Anna did
[1:25:31] she looked at me wrong the other day and
[1:25:33] and I don't think I don't think she
[1:25:36] needs to take it
[1:25:37] it's her fault
[1:25:39] you worry about your fault
[1:25:41] but when I take communion I just do the
[1:25:43] same thing though I said Lord if I made
[1:25:45] it because brother Ryan will tell you in
[1:25:46] the communion message he said now if
[1:25:48] you've committed a wrong to somebody he
[1:25:50] said if you can't get to him right then
[1:25:52] he said go ahead and take communion he
[1:25:54] said but you better go get that took
[1:25:56] care of as soon as you're finished
[1:25:59] Don't Let It Go two weeks and say well
[1:26:01] it was their fault to begin with no
[1:26:03] you're gonna have to deal with God
[1:26:06] that's why I like to have communion
[1:26:08] every month clean your slate off
[1:26:11] don't let that thing pile up listen
[1:26:13] don't let stuff pile up get it out of
[1:26:16] the way and be able to take communion
[1:26:18] because what is communion communion with
[1:26:20] God you're not communing with your
[1:26:21] brother and sister here your community
[1:26:23] with God
[1:26:24] you're saying God I believe that's the
[1:26:27] last commission you gave your disciples
[1:26:29] before you passed this life into another
[1:26:34] life
[1:26:35] and you're not coming back here
[1:26:37] in your Corporal body until we leave
[1:26:40] this place and this is the closest we're
[1:26:42] going to get now it's not turned that
[1:26:44] does not do like Catholic it does not
[1:26:46] turn into the Flesh of God or Jesus In
[1:26:49] the Flesh and the blood but it's a
[1:26:51] symbol he said do this till I come
[1:26:57] do this till I come
[1:27:01] towards assemble that that we're not
[1:27:03] communing with each other we're
[1:27:04] communing with God that one time uh it's
[1:27:07] like it's you know we always
[1:27:09] and I know Sister Rebecca's uh being an
[1:27:12] accountant and different things there's
[1:27:13] time when you check up things you know
[1:27:14] you let things go and
[1:27:16] she wishes you wouldn't so she wouldn't
[1:27:18] have so long to do your taxes talking to
[1:27:20] the Dales the way dailed you now
[1:27:23] but if like it you know if you have a
[1:27:26] checkup time where everything's got to
[1:27:28] come up in balance
[1:27:30] all right well that's what you got to do
[1:27:32] to me with communion I look at it that
[1:27:34] way for me
[1:27:36] it doesn't let it linger three months
[1:27:38] down the road
[1:27:40] when I come in on communion I take it
[1:27:42] serious you better take it serious
[1:27:45] because it it'll tell you that many have
[1:27:47] fell asleep died
[1:27:50] because of taking communion wrong
[1:27:53] she said wow never take it and I see you
[1:27:55] go on the other side you let the devil
[1:27:57] do that but no clean your slate say God
[1:28:00] today of any other day yes
[1:28:03] before I touch that cup before I touch
[1:28:07] that bread
[1:28:08] sanctify me Lord you said you would
[1:28:12] clear my sleep check me up get me to
[1:28:15] balance at zero
[1:28:17] now I might have a big balance come in
[1:28:19] the next month but God right now
[1:28:22] balanced me at zero get me to where I
[1:28:25] zero me out and I trusted what you said
[1:28:29] you said do this till I come
[1:28:31] right you know there's people in the
[1:28:33] message in the message that's quit
[1:28:34] taking communion because they think
[1:28:35] we're in the millennium
[1:28:37] I still want to take them to a zoo
[1:28:42] throw them in with the lines
[1:28:45] because the line's supposed to lay down
[1:28:46] with the lamb in the Millennium you
[1:28:48] understand what I'm saying you know
[1:28:50] we're supposed to have relationship over
[1:28:51] the animals let's talk some over in the
[1:28:53] lines then we'll find out if they're in
[1:28:54] the Millennium or not
[1:29:00] they believe it but they'll never lay
[1:29:02] their hands on to turn Wheels to help it
[1:29:04] go on
[1:29:06] I told y'all many times before just like
[1:29:08] taking communion if you don't take
[1:29:10] communion
[1:29:11] it shows that you do have a problem
[1:29:17] okay
[1:29:19] and then I've for many years a lot of
[1:29:22] people took communion and
[1:29:24] when foot washing time come out the door
[1:29:26] they went
[1:29:28] well Jesus told Peter if you don't do it
[1:29:32] you have no part with me I think to me
[1:29:34] that settles it
[1:29:36] and I don't wait on my favorite person
[1:29:38] to wash your feet either
[1:29:42] well I'm going down that road anyway
[1:29:46] but really
[1:29:47] why wouldn't you want to wash your
[1:29:48] brother's feet you know what Pride
[1:29:52] you're too proud if Jesus classed
[1:29:54] himself washed them dirty feet of those
[1:29:57] disciples you and I ought to do the same
[1:29:59] thing and be happy are ye if you do them
[1:30:03] is what the Bible says
[1:30:08] if I don't you don't let me
[1:30:09] see you have no part with me
[1:30:12] you say oh that was for Peter well no
[1:30:14] that was for me
[1:30:15] it gets rid of my pride when I get down
[1:30:17] to watch somebody like brother Tom
[1:30:19] Ernest always man he looked you out in
[1:30:21] the face he said it's an honor to wash
[1:30:23] your feet brother and he'll get down and
[1:30:25] want big old Tom big tall guy
[1:30:29] brother dick Addison brother Al
[1:30:32] they couldn't hardly walk
[1:30:35] you'd have to help him up
[1:30:37] you know what I don't care if we have to
[1:30:38] put a pulley on this ceiling and pull
[1:30:40] them up by pulley if they want to get
[1:30:43] now and wash somebody's feet praise the
[1:30:44] Lord we'll help them up
[1:30:47] you know what God will reward their
[1:30:48] effort
[1:30:50] I'm sorry didn't mean to get off on that
[1:30:52] but I guess I did but they hung along
[1:30:54] just the same they never got to enter
[1:30:56] the promised land he's talking about the
[1:30:58] people that were
[1:30:59] unbelievers just those who came back
[1:31:02] with faith that we could now what if
[1:31:04] that group would have looked and said oh
[1:31:05] the amorites in other words my sins too
[1:31:08] strong I've done too much
[1:31:11] but you see Caleb and Joshua still the
[1:31:13] people because they wasn't looking for
[1:31:15] at the amorites how big they were if we
[1:31:18] keep looking at how big this sin is or
[1:31:20] how big this world is and how we're
[1:31:23] going to get so caught up in the
[1:31:24] government and we're going to take the
[1:31:26] mark of the beast and we're gonna listen
[1:31:28] if you're born again you're not
[1:31:31] if you are going to take the mark of the
[1:31:33] beast you're not born again
[1:31:36] and brother Ralph said you won't know it
[1:31:38] until it's already done
[1:31:42] how big the city was they were looking
[1:31:44] at a promise God said I give you this
[1:31:46] land it's yours now God give you your
[1:31:48] healing each one of you it's yours well
[1:31:51] now God just didn't go over there and
[1:31:53] took a broom and sweep out Canaan and
[1:31:55] all the amorites and the hittops and all
[1:31:57] of them and swept them out and said come
[1:31:59] on in Israel this is yours they've been
[1:32:02] planting crops for you no sir they had
[1:32:05] to fight for every inch of the way now
[1:32:07] this was their promised land they had to
[1:32:10] fight for
[1:32:11] that's right but they had the promise of
[1:32:14] Victory God told Joshua wherever The
[1:32:16] Souls of your feet tread that I've given
[1:32:18] you so Footprints means possession we
[1:32:21] were talking about that this morning
[1:32:21] Footprints means possession that's why
[1:32:24] to me foot washing is important because
[1:32:25] your feet mean something how blessed and
[1:32:28] how beautiful are the feet
[1:32:31] of them that carry the gospel beautiful
[1:32:36] because Footprints is possession
[1:32:38] everywhere you walk
[1:32:41] you're possessing the gates of the enemy
[1:32:44] brother Brown said look patience with
[1:32:46] what what kind of patience first thing
[1:32:47] is what have patience with who God
[1:32:52] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:32:55] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:32:58] worketh patience you're saying well
[1:33:00] brother wait how does that work well
[1:33:03] if you've got patience
[1:33:06] if you've got faith Abraham was the
[1:33:09] father of our faith he had faith and
[1:33:12] that made him patient
[1:33:13] I didn't say impatient
[1:33:17] having faith that my kids are going to
[1:33:19] come to the Lord and be full of the Holy
[1:33:21] Ghost before the Rapture takes place
[1:33:24] if I have real true faith
[1:33:27] it won't put me in a hurry
[1:33:30] it'll settle me put me in patient mode
[1:33:33] and just wait on God
[1:33:36] can't save them to begin with I've been
[1:33:38] saved 30 something years ago if mama's
[1:33:40] been my savior but she's nice but she
[1:33:42] she she cried out to God Dad cried out
[1:33:44] to God different ones each one of you
[1:33:45] somebody
[1:33:47] you may never matter in your life you
[1:33:49] said boy my my parents were Sinners and
[1:33:52] my grandparents were centers and
[1:33:53] somebody brother Brown's son said some
[1:33:55] Old Saint got on her knees and said God
[1:33:58] Save My Generation
[1:34:01] save my people save them it doesn't
[1:34:04] matter in spite of this one not making
[1:34:06] it save somebody
[1:34:10] if you've got real genuine faith you'll
[1:34:12] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:34:14] work is patience When God says anything
[1:34:16] look you believe it and look by faith
[1:34:19] you take it
[1:34:21] see that's right you've got patience
[1:34:22] well I asked him last night to heal me
[1:34:25] and I'm just as sick
[1:34:27] what patience
[1:34:31] I know he had patience
[1:34:33] if it didn't come today it'll be here
[1:34:35] tomorrow why
[1:34:36] God said so
[1:34:39] God said so
[1:34:42] let me tell you something
[1:34:44] we have come to a spot in the in the
[1:34:47] word of God where look we know who God
[1:34:50] is
[1:34:51] he's not third person of a trinity
[1:34:54] he's not three people he's one God
[1:34:56] so we know that God
[1:34:59] we've come to another place to where we
[1:35:01] know what this said by the prophet's
[1:35:03] message right
[1:35:07] so we know
[1:35:09] in that little thing
[1:35:12] little three God said so because you
[1:35:14] know what somebody in the world can say
[1:35:15] well God said so well he's the third
[1:35:17] person in the trinity
[1:35:20] said to baptize the name of the father
[1:35:22] son Holy Ghost sure he did
[1:35:25] but not the way you wanted
[1:35:28] so when we make that statement when
[1:35:30] brother Brown makes that statement to me
[1:35:32] it just thundered out all over the world
[1:35:35] God said so because you know who that
[1:35:37] God is
[1:35:38] you know what he said is the truth
[1:35:41] and so be it
[1:35:44] to me folks that's patience
[1:35:48] if it been up to us we don't the Rapture
[1:35:50] would have took place a long time ago
[1:35:53] but just let it go he's Let It Go he's
[1:35:56] Let It Go
[1:35:58] he's Let It Go to where now we see
[1:36:00] others coming back in we see others
[1:36:02] um
[1:36:03] going out but he knew that
[1:36:06] now we find God comes this far look
[1:36:08] waiting for the church too
[1:36:11] but it'll be there don't you worry he
[1:36:14] promised it Isaiah 40 verse 28
[1:36:18] musicians come on don't stop right here
[1:36:19] hast thou not known
[1:36:21] hash thou not heard
[1:36:27] that the Everlasting God
[1:36:29] the Lord the creator of the ends of the
[1:36:32] Earth fainteth not neither is he weary
[1:36:36] there is no searching of his
[1:36:39] understanding he giveth power to the
[1:36:42] faint and to them that have no might he
[1:36:46] increases strength how many of you want
[1:36:48] to get in that so do I even the youth
[1:36:52] shall feign and be weary and the young
[1:36:54] men shall utterly fall
[1:36:56] but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:37:01] shall renew their strength
[1:37:04] they shall mine up with wings as an
[1:37:06] eagle
[1:37:07] they shall run
[1:37:09] and not be weary
[1:37:11] they shall walk
[1:37:13] see something's going to run some gonna
[1:37:14] walk and not fail
[1:37:17] as the song says Teach Me Lord
[1:37:20] Teach Me Lord
[1:37:22] to wait where does it tell you to wait
[1:37:24] at though down on your knees
[1:37:26] let's stand to our feet
[1:37:29] I read this and then we'll close the
[1:37:31] trouble of it is
[1:37:33] with we people
[1:37:35] now listen this was 1962.
[1:37:40] think of all the advancements that we
[1:37:42] have now that they didn't have back then
[1:37:44] we got phones that we can go in and and
[1:37:46] order everything from a car
[1:37:49] almost to a house on our phone
[1:37:52] and brother Brown says look we're in too
[1:37:54] much of a hurry
[1:37:56] it's just got to be done right now
[1:37:59] can't come back no more see
[1:38:01] and when you get that in your mind that
[1:38:04] you're going to loot that when you get
[1:38:05] that in your mind you're going to lose
[1:38:08] right there
[1:38:09] you're a losing ground right there you
[1:38:12] have nothing to stand on you must be
[1:38:15] patient
[1:38:16] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:38:19] their strength and mount it with wings
[1:38:20] like an eagle I like that just be
[1:38:22] patient wait look God's in no hurry
[1:38:27] he let the Hebrew children walk right
[1:38:30] into the furnace
[1:38:32] before he ever moved a finger
[1:38:39] we'd be nervous I'm sure they were
[1:38:40] nervous in their self but you know what
[1:38:43] they stood there and said they said our
[1:38:45] God
[1:38:48] we're going to worship him we're not
[1:38:49] going to worship yours you're not going
[1:38:51] to make us not worship Our God and if he
[1:38:54] in other words if he don't come on the
[1:38:55] scene we're going to die and meet him in
[1:38:57] just a few seconds
[1:38:58] but oh my did he not come on the scene
[1:39:00] and listen not even did they get burned
[1:39:03] they didn't even smell like smoke when
[1:39:04] they come out
[1:39:05] God so Sanctified them man he put them
[1:39:08] in a fiery furnace and brought them out
[1:39:09] just like they'd been on a Alaska voyage
[1:39:13] that's right and let Daniel go right in
[1:39:15] the line and say listen lower him right
[1:39:17] down
[1:39:20] Daniel probably wasn't shouting and
[1:39:22] speaking in tongues
[1:39:23] he probably was worried a little bit
[1:39:25] about those lines but when he saw that
[1:39:27] line walk by him and just walked by him
[1:39:30] and then sat down beside of him and
[1:39:32] start praying like a kitten
[1:39:34] he knew right then that something was
[1:39:36] going on
[1:39:37] God was on the scene Jesus look watch
[1:39:39] this Jesus
[1:39:41] Jim grave his soul went to hell
[1:39:44] the bottomless pin pit right out of the
[1:39:47] Grave because
[1:39:48] the devil often went straight into Glory
[1:39:50] with it
[1:39:51] see he's in no hurry
[1:39:53] he's God
[1:39:55] we just get in a hurry is the only thing
[1:39:57] you see we miss it so don't be in a
[1:40:01] hurry wait and watch listen take the
[1:40:04] scripture examine it see if it's right
[1:40:06] and if it's right hold on to it if it's
[1:40:09] not tell me so I can get it right
[1:40:13] that should be our prayer
[1:40:16] then remember what happened with Noah
[1:40:19] remember Noah Noah here here's the great
[1:40:23] Crescendo of his sermon he comes up
[1:40:26] today 120. of his 120 year sermon
[1:40:30] and God says get in the ark
[1:40:33] God said get in the ark all right so
[1:40:36] whatever voice no had been listening to
[1:40:38] he listened to that one too he knew it
[1:40:41] was God God said get in the art so
[1:40:42] Noah's like it's gonna rain
[1:40:45] as soon as them doors shut it's gonna
[1:40:47] just pour

[1:41:29] a thing to people laughing throwing
[1:41:31] Rotten Tomatoes and things against the
[1:41:32] side of it
[1:41:33] look there what you're doing why you say
[1:41:39] he said be patient son
[1:41:41] are you sure it will rain
[1:41:44] his daughter-in-law said father you know

[1:41:52] going to rain a week ago and we're in
[1:41:54] here and the doors are shut here we are
[1:41:56] walking around and the sun just
[1:41:58] scorching right down the on us but it
[1:42:01] will rain
[1:42:03] how do you know
[1:42:05] God said so
[1:42:09] now we get that way at it but if we
[1:42:12] ain't got it that way don't try to add
[1:42:14] it it won't work

[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:21] yo they had to have faith
[1:45:23] that night of the Passover they had to
[1:45:27] believe something had never been written
[1:45:31] they had to believe a man
[1:45:35] and one wrote down brother John it
[1:45:38] wasn't in the sky it wasn't published
[1:45:40] and handed out to everybody
[1:45:43] God told Moses
[1:45:46] tell your people
[1:45:48] take a lamb
[1:45:50] kill that lamb
[1:45:52] take the blood
[1:45:54] and put it over the doorpost
[1:45:57] and don't get out stay in there eat that
[1:46:01] lamb don't don't don't fry it
[1:46:05] don't put no herbs on it
[1:46:07] this is not a party right this is
[1:46:10] getting ready to go
[1:46:12] it's a solemn time and look don't get
[1:46:15] dilatory and sit down and take your
[1:46:17] shoes off and put your house shoes on
[1:46:19] he said because we're leaving
[1:46:21] you're leaving this place
[1:46:24] as soon as the death angel passes you're
[1:46:27] going out of here
[1:46:28] but if you're not under that blood
[1:46:31] you'll die awesome
[1:46:35] you know people that they were this far
[1:46:39] from death
[1:46:40] and that far from life
[1:46:43] right inside the door they were safe if
[1:46:46] they just stepped right outside the door
[1:46:47] they died
[1:46:49] they believed
[1:46:51] that that blood was going to protect
[1:46:53] them
[1:46:54] they believed in that's why brother
[1:46:56] Brown preaches the token
[1:47:01] you understand
[1:47:02] while that blood had to be shed we
[1:47:05] understand why Jesus had to shed his
[1:47:07] blood we understand how those symbols
[1:47:09] and everything but that Blood Brother
[1:47:10] Brown then he comes he sums everything
[1:47:13] up in a sermon he says the bride is now
[1:47:17] the blood
[1:47:18] by the spirit
[1:47:20] the bride is now the blood by the spirit
[1:47:26] so whatever went over that doorpost
[1:47:29] was the bride
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] whatever hung at Calvary
[1:47:35] say what you wish
[1:47:37] that's the bride
[1:47:39] but now we understand that by the spirit
[1:47:42] of God we're that blood
[1:47:45] you that's pretty strong bro that's
[1:47:47] pretty well well you talk to brother
[1:47:48] Brown about it
[1:47:50] he said now see you come to a place now
[1:47:53] the bride is the blood by the spirit
[1:47:56] that means the same spirit that was in
[1:47:58] that blood the same Spirits Inside Me
[1:48:00] and You
[1:48:02] and he's ready to not just give us a
[1:48:04] little Redemption
[1:48:05] and put it over your doorpost he put it
[1:48:08] inside of you
[1:48:09] so now you're protected the blood's been
[1:48:12] applied you're walking in newness of
[1:48:14] life
[1:48:16] we can't fail
[1:48:18] we may look bad we may look bad hey we
[1:48:20] got Monday coming up
[1:48:23] okay
[1:48:25] but God willing will be your Wednesday
[1:48:26] there here brother Louise it will have
[1:48:29] made it through another Monday
[1:48:31] hey man count those
[1:48:34] we count all these other days count
[1:48:35] every Monday is a blessing to get
[1:48:37] through
[1:48:39] but same thing with us and our walk with
[1:48:42] God we all have Mondays in our walk
[1:48:46] we all have Sundays in our walk
[1:48:48] in our week
[1:48:51] but let's not be weak
[1:48:53] and Faith let's believe that sure we got
[1:48:55] a trial to go through
[1:48:58] but on the other side
[1:49:00] is a blessing
[1:49:02] those children of Israel would have died
[1:49:04] if they would have went outside of that
[1:49:06] blood but everyone that stayed inside I
[1:49:09] like that talking about the movie The
[1:49:10] Ten Commandments you see that death
[1:49:12] angel coming down that black and you see
[1:49:15] it hitting the ground and start
[1:49:16] spreading out well you know what it
[1:49:18] don't good didn't go under no crack in
[1:49:20] the in the the one that had the blood
[1:49:22] because you know what happened that
[1:49:23] Death Angel he goes down and he looks
[1:49:25] and he sees blood
[1:49:27] he keeps going
[1:49:29] he finds one it's not he goes right in
[1:49:32] because that was his commission God told
[1:49:34] him said take the firstborn and if
[1:49:36] you're not applying if I don't apply the
[1:49:37] blood get them out of you know take them
[1:49:39] out and they did all of Israel the Bible
[1:49:41] said all of Egypt was screaming even the
[1:49:44] firstborn of the cattle everything that
[1:49:46] was first born died that night
[1:49:48] except the ones that were covered
[1:49:51] with the blood they did what a preacher
[1:49:55] told them to do
[1:49:58] learn
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:14] my sins is the blood that still
[1:50:18] cleanses me
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:40] you
[1:50:42] lives of life
[1:50:44] I cannot fall for it's greater than all
[1:50:49] the blood
