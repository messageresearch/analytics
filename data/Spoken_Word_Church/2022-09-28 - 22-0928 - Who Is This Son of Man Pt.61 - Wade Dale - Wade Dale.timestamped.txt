[8:51] on with the Lord
[8:52] and uh we got to take communion and foot
[8:55] washing and kind of rededicate the place

[9:00] we appreciate them we love him with the
[9:02] love of the Lord it is a long way up
[9:05] there though
[9:06] that airplane's not very long but boy
[9:09] about 11 hours of driving it's tough
[9:12] making eyes cross when you get
[9:15] about halfway down here but we broke it
[9:16] up a little bit we got to see brother
[9:17] Richard and Sister Janice Wilson have uh
[9:20] lunch with them and fellowship for a
[9:22] couple hours for them and then we took
[9:24] on off and visited some friends of ours
[9:27] that we had not seen for a long long
[9:28] time and since about 1995 they used to
[9:33] be our neighbors so we got a chance to
[9:35] spend some time with them so it was all
[9:37] good everything was good
[9:39] all right uh Saturday we will have Bible
[9:41] study between six and eight o'clock as
[9:44] usual
[9:45] uh communion will be Sunday brother
[9:47] Aaron will be speaking next Wednesday
[9:49] Lord willing also remember on October
[9:53] the 9th brother Samuel najera from uh
[9:57] Beaufort South Carolina will be with us
[9:58] his children have been here he's been
[10:00] here but he's going to minister for us
[10:02] him and him and brother Louise actually
[10:04] will be doing the ministering so because
[10:06] he'll be uh speaking in Spanish but
[10:08] we'll have him with us on October the
[10:10] 9th
[10:11] and now on October the 16th I've been
[10:13] thinking about this um
[10:16] it seems like I get in trouble when I
[10:17] write things down
[10:19] but uh
[10:24] boot devil
[10:26] but on October the 16th at second
[10:28] service
[10:30] October the 16th that'll be three weeks
[10:33] and second service we're going to have
[10:36] questions and answers for singles and
[10:39] Youth
[10:41] Donnie you're out
[10:44] but for singles and youth right on
[10:48] that'll be the second service
[10:50] on October 16th so if you have any
[10:53] questions forward them to me or give
[10:56] them to one of the deacons brother
[10:57] Terence brother Bob or one of the
[10:59] ministers and then they can pass them
[11:02] into me now don't do it on that day
[11:06] you can if you wish
[11:08] but um kind of give us a little bit of
[11:11] time to study some and uh but it's been
[11:14] on my heart for for a little while we
[11:16] used to do it with the youth when we had
[11:17] to use service but it kind of extended
[11:20] made everything longer and we couldn't
[11:21] Fellowship a lot so so we're going to do
[11:23] that as a church for singles and for the
[11:26] Youth if you have a question that you
[11:29] need to ask that's been on your heart
[11:31] between now and then the Lord should
[11:33] give you something Lord to Lord give you
[11:35] something to ask but it'll be the second
[11:37] service the whole service will take up
[11:39] on questions and answers just for the
[11:41] Youth and just for singles everybody
[11:43] with me all right Nyla that's you unless
[11:46] something happens miraculous in the next
[11:48] three weeks
[11:52] truly just fell
[11:56] but it's been on my heart to do that so
[11:58] um
[11:59] we were praying the other night and that
[12:02] came in my heart also to uh to let the
[12:05] youth have a voice to let them ask some
[12:07] questions and even the singles
[12:10] um
[12:10] Pearl Zack and Lily will be married by
[12:13] then so
[12:14] they won't get to ask anything but if
[12:16] you have a question
[12:17] please bring it forward and give it to
[12:19] us and also remember by way of just
[12:23] letting you know remember to
[12:25] everybody's done the
[12:29] RSVP if you go into the wedding all
[12:32] right which is on November the 6th
[12:34] at four o'clock we'll only have one
[12:36] service here and then we'll go to the
[12:38] wedding
[12:39] and then also the church dinner we
[12:41] always have one at Thanksgiving and it's
[12:43] not catered so we'll be we'll be
[12:46] um all of us will be cooking for that
[12:48] will be on November 13th
[12:51] November 13th we'll only have one
[12:53] service
[12:54] November 13th and that's not too far
[12:57] away where did September go
[13:00] now
[13:02] you know when you say even some come
[13:04] quickly Lord Jesus he's helping us
[13:07] right he's helping us because this thing
[13:09] is going fast I mean like really fast
[13:12] but you know thank God I'd hate for it
[13:14] to be lengthened the other way in this
[13:17] world that we live in goodness gracious
[13:19] you got that right you ain't kidding so
[13:21] let's turn our Bibles and get this thing
[13:25] fired up here
[13:28] to John
[13:30] and tonight I want to bring a little I
[13:32] want to bring it a little at a little
[13:34] bit of an angle
[13:36] I've been praying about uh
[13:39] about this one thing and and it's called
[13:42] a showdown
[13:45] there's going to be a showdown
[13:48] but there's going to be a showdown when
[13:50] we start up that statue of perfect man
[13:52] because it's going to be a separation
[13:54] some will fall off some will not make it
[13:56] I'm sorry that's just the way it is
[13:58] some will some won't you just got to
[14:00] decide whether you want to or not amen
[14:02] so it's your decision
[14:05] if you want to make it or not God has
[14:07] given us all the provisions he has not
[14:10] let's think about this the other day God
[14:12] you know we can we go to work and and uh
[14:15] somebody was saying something the other
[14:16] day about uh you know getting mistreated
[14:19] at work
[14:21] well I mean we all do we all think we
[14:23] get mistreated but kids think you get
[14:24] mistreated by the parents the parents
[14:26] they could get mistreated by the
[14:27] grandparents you know you just keep
[14:28] going up the line
[14:30] everybody gets mistreated by everybody
[14:32] and listen when we were born listen
[14:34] we're the one of the most selfish things
[14:36] on the earth as a human being
[14:38] think about it we're the most selfish
[14:41] people in the world but when we get up
[14:43] to that brotherly kindness that's going
[14:45] to have to shed off
[14:48] that's gonna have to shed off it's not
[14:50] whether you like me and I don't like you
[14:51] or whether you said something good and I
[14:53] like you and I'm in your camp today but
[14:54] tomorrow I'll be in another Camp because
[14:56] you said something to hurt my feelings
[14:58] no that's not what brotherly kindness is
[15:00] not that kind of Brotherly kindness
[15:02] so there's going to be a showdown and
[15:04] we'll listen to what brother Brown has
[15:06] to say about Showdown
[15:07] because there's going to be one there
[15:09] was one in the largest time there was
[15:10] one in Jesus this time and there's going
[15:12] to be one in the end time there's going
[15:15] to be a showdown so we're going to go
[15:17] through this
[15:19] and this would be part 61. and I hope
[15:22] and pray that we continue on the
[15:25] uh the service we had a couple weeks ago
[15:27] I know that sometimes is that was an
[15:29] anomaly but but I enjoyed it but you
[15:33] just think about you think about that
[15:35] atmosphere we were under a couple of
[15:37] Sundays ago
[15:38] because see it Ebbs and flows and that's
[15:40] just the way it is it's just like this
[15:42] our whole life is you know just like
[15:45] this but when we get into eternity
[15:48] sister Anna that's gonna be for an
[15:52] eternity
[15:52] there'll be no I'm tired we got to close
[15:55] the service no it'll be just
[15:56] continuously like that so if you didn't
[15:58] like it two weeks ago you ain't gonna
[16:00] like it in eternity and you probably
[16:02] ain't gonna be there
[16:05] we gotta get used to it here
[16:08] let it out
[16:10] I'll even read your quote where brother
[16:12] Brown almost says that let it out
[16:14] whatever you got let it out
[16:16] so let's bow our heads
[16:19] I know we all have needs
[16:21] we remember the ones in Florida
[16:23] some of the Believers down there riding
[16:26] it out so
[16:27] we know the master of the Wind
[16:29] hey man remember sister Brenda Lewis you
[16:32] wrote that song
[16:33] it'll take a stronger win than this
[16:37] and she wrote it in the middle of a
[16:38] hurricane
[16:39] hey man so in in your troubles today in
[16:42] the middle of your hurricane you
[16:44] remember it'll take a stronger wind than
[16:46] that to knock a Christian off
[16:48] dear heavenly father Lord thank you for
[16:50] this evening you give us
[16:52] thank you for the people you have here
[16:53] Lord assembled together
[16:55] Lord may we all be now in one mind and
[16:57] one Accord may we lose all the thoughts
[16:59] of the of the world and the things that
[17:02] we need to do and we got to do and
[17:03] forgot to do
[17:05] Lord may we just listen to you just for
[17:07] a few minutes Lord
[17:08] I know there's many needs father many
[17:10] sicknesses and Among Us Lord
[17:12] I pray that you'll just be with them
[17:14] Lord and comfort them be with the ones
[17:16] that are traveling such a Barbara said
[17:18] she's traveling out so be with her Lord
[17:19] be with the ones in Florida Lord even be
[17:22] with the ones the linemen and all the
[17:23] ones that are doing the work Lord you'll
[17:26] keep them safe Lord no trees will fall
[17:27] on them or get electrocuted because it's
[17:29] a it's a real trying time when you have
[17:31] to put those wires back up so we pray
[17:33] for them also Lord father they're human
[17:36] beings
[17:37] doesn't matter if they're bright or not
[17:38] they're human beings
[17:40] and we pray for the human beings that
[17:42] are there Lord that you'll come for them
[17:43] Lord give them strength father and that
[17:46] you'll bless the one the little bride
[17:47] also this is there Lord I know they're
[17:49] what they're doing they're talking to
[17:50] you and I pray now that you'll just be
[17:52] with us in this service speak to us
[17:54] today forgive us of our sins in Jesus
[17:56] name we pray
[17:57] amen let me read you this quote brother
[17:59] Brown says and stop you a perfect man so
[18:01] now that is the house that God dwells in
[18:03] that's what we're coming to we've we've
[18:05] come to the place to where we uh leaving
[18:09] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[18:10] we should be able to leave the
[18:12] principles of being born again uh and I
[18:15] hope that that that that we understand
[18:17] that being born again is a journey
[18:22] all right it's not an Abrupt tent it's a
[18:23] journey it's a journey to get born again
[18:26] but once you get bored again brother
[18:27] Brown said you just began to start right
[18:29] there that begins your Christian Journey
[18:30] all right and if you're in justification
[18:33] you're in sanctification and and you
[18:35] realize that then thank God you realize
[18:37] that
[18:37] a man knocked it out just got it all and
[18:39] I'm going to lay down in the I'm gonna
[18:41] lay down in the Roses well you lay down
[18:43] well roses you'd be in bad shape lay
[18:46] down lay down into into lilies and just
[18:48] lay back in the field well it's probably
[18:51] a fire ant bed laying underneath you
[18:54] called the devil
[18:56] but now this is the house that God
[18:57] dwells in not a building with a big Bell
[18:59] on top of it and a high steeple but a
[19:01] body has now prepared me a body that God
[19:04] can dwell in look God can walk in God
[19:08] can sin God can talk in God can work in
[19:11] amen living
[19:13] instrumentality of God God walking on
[19:16] two feet in you glory the footsteps of
[19:20] the righteous is ordered of God God
[19:22] walking in you for you are written
[19:23] Epistles read of all men
[19:25] and if the life that's in Christ being
[19:27] you you'll bear the life
[19:29] that Christ born now what is the life of
[19:31] Christ
[19:32] right there
[19:33] that's not your perfect man that is the
[19:36] life of Jesus Christ that is what he
[19:38] lived and listen that's what he
[19:39] portrayed he didn't just live it he
[19:42] portrayed it in his everyday walk but
[19:45] you got to remember like I said before
[19:46] he was so misunderstood they called him
[19:48] a wine barrel they said he hung around
[19:49] Sinners and prostitutes they said he
[19:51] wasn't Belgium of he was the king of the
[19:53] devils no he was this right here in the
[19:56] beginning was the word the word was with
[19:58] God and the Word was God and the Word
[20:00] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we
[20:03] behold his glory the glory the only
[20:04] begotten of the father
[20:06] for the grace and truth he may be seated
[20:08] Lord has blessing to the reading of the
[20:10] word think about this God that created
[20:12] the air had to one day suck that air in
[20:14] his lungs
[20:15] and start screaming
[20:18] and he was a baby
[20:20] he decided to do that he decided to come
[20:22] down
[20:23] to where you and he that funnel came
[20:25] down to humanity to where you and I
[20:28] could what we can live like he lived all
[20:31] right amen divine right with that
[20:33] all right first Thessalonians four of
[20:35] those forces that every one of you
[20:37] should know how to possess his vessel I
[20:40] was thinking yesterday
[20:41] you know you like I said before you've
[20:44] got that faction over here that says
[20:46] well if anything is dead ought to be
[20:48] buried you got the faction over here
[20:50] that says well we need all teaching but
[20:52] there's got to be a middle of the road
[20:54] there's got to be there's got to be some
[20:56] emotion when when you sisters had babies
[20:58] there was an emotion all right and you
[21:01] remembered when you had that child
[21:03] hey man so that we remember now look
[21:05] every one of you should know
[21:08] when you go to school
[21:10] and you learn and you go through 12
[21:13] grades and you get a diploma
[21:15] 12 grades get a diploma right
[21:19] you you have what you've accomplished
[21:21] what man says you need for that time and
[21:23] period of your life but now that doesn't
[21:25] make you super intelligent that doesn't
[21:27] make you a doctor instantly that doesn't
[21:29] make you a teacher instantly that
[21:32] doesn't make you the best human being
[21:34] that ever lived no you got a part of
[21:36] your journey finished
[21:38] all right so when we come to this we're
[21:40] going to see that that we come to the
[21:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost and we leave
[21:44] that we don't leave it alone we leave it
[21:46] because it becomes part of us and then
[21:48] we walk on that diploma that you got at
[21:51] high school it's followed you for the
[21:53] rest of your life whether you know it or
[21:55] not you've used it sometime in your life
[21:58] you've used what was behind that diploma
[22:01] what some teacher taught you
[22:05] are you getting the spiritual part of
[22:07] this
[22:07] amen because there's a spiritual part of
[22:09] this it's the teaching that we have we
[22:11] love teaching we are built for teaching
[22:15] we love to hear good teaching all right
[22:18] but what we're going to do with that
[22:19] teaching is going to have to take us to
[22:21] a body change or either we just sat here
[22:23] and wasted our time
[22:25] I'm sorry that's what I'm telling you
[22:26] it's going to be a showdown you say well
[22:28] listen the Bible says more is received
[22:32] more is required
[22:34] so the more we have it's required God's
[22:36] looking at us saying hey come on
[22:39] you got it what are you going to do with
[22:41] it because there's a lot of places go
[22:43] out to the internet and listen I'm sorry
[22:45] I'm like brother Branham you know I
[22:48] don't ever want to be critical but
[22:49] brother Bynum had a critical spirit one
[22:51] time does everybody know that
[22:53] put in your put it in your computer and
[22:55] put in critical he said God forgive me
[22:57] for this critical spirit that I have
[22:58] because he was criticizing everybody
[23:00] even brother around even brother Brown
[23:01] came to a place where he called him
[23:03] Ricky's and rickettas and what God say
[23:05] he said don't do that no more
[23:06] those are my kids those are my children
[23:08] amen so we got to be able to put this
[23:11] out there and I was telling them in Ohio
[23:13] it's got to be able uh God's a master
[23:15] surgeon he can cut you and you don't
[23:17] even know it
[23:19] but now I promise you we've been in some
[23:21] Services where they fire up a chainsaw
[23:24] it ain't pretty when a chainsaw goes to
[23:27] cutting flesh there's blood on the wall
[23:29] Blood on the floor guts all over the
[23:31] place that's not what we want that's
[23:32] what the devil will do to you if you'll
[23:34] let him
[23:35] but I want to go to the master surgeon I
[23:37] want to go to where that cut this thing
[23:39] out of me cut all this out of me and
[23:41] listen may not even know it at the
[23:43] moment but have a aha moment say hey
[23:45] that thing's gone
[23:47] hey that thing's it left me
[23:49] that's what I want us to experience I
[23:51] want every one of you to say all right
[23:53] this is where I begin
[23:55] this is my attitude this is my altitude
[23:57] and this is where I began now what am I
[24:00] going to do three months later six
[24:01] months later if we're here that long A
[24:04] year later what are we going to do from
[24:05] here to there if you stayed the same
[24:07] then listen God moves on
[24:10] right God is a mover he is not he
[24:13] doesn't go backwards
[24:15] we're the only ones that backslide
[24:18] don't backslide now he'll go back and
[24:20] get you
[24:22] thank God
[24:23] but he's not gonna go back and stay he's
[24:26] going to bring you up but that every one
[24:28] of you should know how to possess his
[24:30] what his vessel
[24:31] that's not your car
[24:34] that's not it's not a vessel like a car
[24:36] or or our house that's the vessel you
[24:40] walk around in every day that's the
[24:42] vessel that the world sees and I was
[24:44] saying a couple of Sundays ago listen
[24:46] God is depending on me and you
[24:49] to get this thing finished
[24:51] he's gonna he's done his part he's given
[24:53] us the Holy Ghost he's given us the word
[24:55] of God he's given us everything we need
[24:57] and now he's given us a chance to walk
[24:59] up that statue of perfect man I say walk
[25:02] up yes thus don't run up
[25:07] come on
[25:09] let's walk up brother Brian said you
[25:12] want to jump way up here you want to
[25:13] jump everybody wants to everybody wants
[25:15] to be in the son of man Ministry when
[25:16] they don't even have the Son of God
[25:17] Ministry down yet
[25:19] to having all these virtues working as
[25:22] it was as it was working with the
[25:24] disciples in the early days
[25:27] so that's what I want us to come back to
[25:29] that disciple of the early days to where
[25:32] the little nod from God the prophet said
[25:34] there was a little tug at their heart
[25:36] and they went and did what they were
[25:37] going to do
[25:38] they would preach and the Holy Ghost
[25:39] would just fall on people
[25:42] right
[25:43] you said no I gotta have it they didn't
[25:46] back there so they're not going to have
[25:47] to have it now
[25:49] while the word was being preached the
[25:51] Holy Ghost fell on the people and they
[25:53] got born again just by the word being
[25:55] preached all right and it wasn't a
[25:57] father son holy ghost or two Soul or
[25:58] ever or some denominational idea it was
[26:01] the word of God
[26:03] and they said that ain't nothing but the
[26:05] truth
[26:06] and God fell down in a heart birthed
[26:08] them and they started on their Journey
[26:10] so every one of you should know how to
[26:13] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[26:14] honor I don't it's not my obligation
[26:16] well actually standing where I'm at
[26:18] today it is my obligation to make sure
[26:20] Donnie gets there but it's Donny's
[26:22] obligation to get there
[26:23] amen we can't pull you through this
[26:26] thing remember God's not going to pull
[26:28] you through a tube you got to make a
[26:30] choice and you got to be able to what
[26:32] move with God as he moves we move all
[26:35] right but be not conformed to this world
[26:38] but be transformed by the renewing of
[26:41] your mind how many times have I read
[26:42] that but how many times have we have we
[26:44] studied it we're going to go on up when
[26:45] we've talked about talk about virtue
[26:47] knowledge Temperance patience it's not
[26:49] what the world thinks about virtue it's
[26:51] not what the world thinks about
[26:52] knowledge it's not what the world thinks
[26:54] about Temperance and patience and all
[26:56] these things that's what you think it
[26:58] was what was supposed to be done through
[26:59] you all right brotherly kindness oh yeah
[27:02] we love our brother
[27:04] well we'll get to that
[27:07] that's one of the roughest ones it's way
[27:10] up there right before the Capstone it's
[27:12] there for a purpose
[27:14] all right
[27:16] well you love them if they love them
[27:17] love them if they hate you don't just
[27:20] tolerate them that's the difference
[27:26] four
[27:30] when you grow and when you were raising
[27:32] your kids we are as human beings we were
[27:36] born with a selfish nature
[27:39] that's mine
[27:41] play with this toy that's fine as long
[27:43] as I play with this toy I'm good but
[27:44] don't you come over here and take it
[27:45] from me
[27:46] all right we're born with a selfish
[27:48] nature this give it to me it's mine this
[27:50] is mine I especially in laodicea oh my
[27:53] Lord Give Me My Rights I got my rights
[27:57] I was talking brother Chris Long
[27:58] yesterday and he said to tell you hi by
[28:00] the way
[28:01] he's I talked let's talk about this new
[28:03] gender reveal thing or gender thing is
[28:05] going on you know they can choose who
[28:07] they want and choose what they want
[28:08] gender they want
[28:10] he said there's a guy I told bro Chris
[28:12] he said I'm going to a gender reveal
[28:14] party and brother Chris said
[28:15] do you not know what gender you are
[28:21] they ought to do away with those gender
[28:22] reveal parties
[28:24] because according to the world
[28:27] they get to choose when they get here
[28:28] what they are you see how this world's
[28:30] perverted yeah
[28:31] God made a man a man and a woman a woman
[28:33] he made that for a reason
[28:35] hey man that you be transformed by the
[28:38] renewing of your mind because that
[28:39] listen the mind of this world has gone
[28:41] crazy the mind of this world will not
[28:44] think like you the mind of this world
[28:46] will be absolutely contrary to you
[28:50] that's why I said well there's a
[28:51] showdown coming listen there was a long
[28:53] time that Bale and that the prophets of
[28:56] Baal they existed with Jezebel
[28:59] then all of a sudden Elijah's Elijah
[29:01] steps on the scene and there's a
[29:03] different story being told there was a
[29:05] showdown all right but see that didn't
[29:08] bother them because Baal just continued
[29:11] it went on to uh it went on to moloch
[29:14] and all the different ones and all the
[29:16] way up to Jesus's time so it didn't do
[29:18] anything to the people
[29:20] the devil just kept going on and kept
[29:22] changing his mind and doing different
[29:23] things but God never changes his mind
[29:27] so by the renewing of our mind that what
[29:29] that you may prove what is that good and
[29:31] acceptable and perfect will of God the
[29:32] only time the word of God is going to be
[29:33] proven to me and you
[29:36] you can't prove it any other way how you
[29:38] gonna prove it well I'll show you right
[29:39] here I got a quote the world don't care
[29:41] about a quote they care about you
[29:43] amen we care about quotes because it
[29:45] builds our character it builds our faith
[29:47] but the world doesn't care about a quote
[29:49] don't give me a quote give me a life
[29:52] second Peter 1 says Simon Peter a
[29:54] servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to
[29:56] them that have what obtained how many
[29:58] times have we read this but I want you
[29:59] to look at this we have obtained light
[30:01] precious Faith with us through the
[30:03] righteousness of God and our savior
[30:05] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[30:07] multiplied unto you through the
[30:09] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[30:11] according to his divine power
[30:14] the only way that's why I stress so much
[30:16] about the New Birth the only way you're
[30:18] going to get a divine power that renews
[30:21] your mind and gets you to thinking
[30:22] different is when you get the Holy Ghost
[30:24] and that's not an anointing on your
[30:26] flesh that's the new birth the burning
[30:28] out of what's inside of yours we've been
[30:31] talking about the future home God burns
[30:33] out all that old nature that all that
[30:36] old you is burnt completely out
[30:37] amen and it's the Holy Ghost and Fire
[30:40] that does it
[30:42] we'll talk about that in just a minute
[30:44] according as his divine power has given
[30:46] unto what us all things they're
[30:48] pertaining to life and godliness through
[30:50] the knowledge of him that have called us
[30:51] to glory and virtue whereby are giving
[30:54] unto us exceeding great and precious
[30:56] promises listen before we even get up
[30:58] this statue a perfect man you ought to
[31:00] know you're blessed you ought to know
[31:01] that you get the promises of God you
[31:03] ought to know that you ought to be
[31:04] living above the world Amen
[31:07] that by these you might be what
[31:09] partakers then your partakers of a
[31:11] divine nature after you get born again
[31:13] after you receive this renewing of your
[31:16] mind you might be partakers of the
[31:18] divine nature what's the divine nature
[31:21] it's the statue of perfect man that's
[31:23] why it's so important because listen
[31:25] like I'll read to you in just a little
[31:27] while brother Brown says these these
[31:30] gifts that God give us are a stumbling
[31:33] block if you don't have the virtues he
[31:35] ran up against a crowd of people in the
[31:37] Pentecostal time wave when he was a
[31:38] young guy and there was one would stand
[31:40] up and speak in tongues and the other
[31:42] one would interpret they Shout Scream
[31:43] praise God and brother Branham with his
[31:46] little gift you know he pulled that gift
[31:47] out and he says all right this one's
[31:49] good
[31:50] and this one's committing adultery
[31:52] same congregation
[31:55] amen
[31:57] so what was it was this one had a
[32:01] husband just had it on his Flash
[32:04] right but you have escaped the
[32:06] corruption that is in the world through
[32:08] lust so the first stage has got to be
[32:09] the birth I'm going to read this one
[32:11] more time
[32:12] now that's what the way it is trying to
[32:14] manufacture Christianity you can't do it
[32:17] listen if you're not born again you are
[32:19] manufacturing Christianity at the point
[32:21] we are right now now I know you say well
[32:24] now brother what if I'm Justified or
[32:25] Sanctified you're still not finished yet
[32:28] right you're still you're still not
[32:30] finished
[32:32] you're just foolish virgin material at
[32:34] that point in time everybody with me on
[32:36] that maybe this will be a showdown I
[32:38] want it to be a showdown I don't want us
[32:40] that soft open and say well I I come to
[32:43] church every once in a while and I
[32:44] believe the message and I don't cut my
[32:45] hand or don't do this and don't do that
[32:46] and I'm trying that's fine keep trying
[32:50] but you got to come to a place that you
[32:51] get a birth
[32:53] because that birth is what's going to
[32:54] put you in that first resurrection it's
[32:56] going to put you in the rapture
[33:00] the second birth is not
[33:02] remember the second Resurrection if you
[33:04] get a second Resurrection it's going to
[33:06] be way down the road sometime and that
[33:08] meant you didn't get your birth over on
[33:09] this side all right because remember
[33:12] when we get born again it does renew our
[33:14] mind you know what it does it brings
[33:17] eternity
[33:19] into a Time vessel
[33:22] think about that it brings an eternity
[33:25] it brings a theophany it brings an
[33:28] eternal God that Genesis 1 26 and 27
[33:30] brings it into this Dimension puts it
[33:33] inside of you and it locks itself in and
[33:36] it can't get out except you show what's
[33:39] inside of you that's what's going to
[33:41] happen we are going to show what's
[33:43] inside of us good or bad right
[33:46] we were discussing up there this weekend
[33:49] about foolish virgin remember the
[33:52] foolish version is not bright never will
[33:54] be bride it never was bride
[33:56] amen but there are virgins
[34:00] they heard the call
[34:02] they wanted oil
[34:05] and they even knew what congregation to
[34:07] go get it at
[34:10] give us of your oil
[34:12] five wise virgins well who's the five
[34:14] wise virgin the bride
[34:17] is it bright out there I don't know I
[34:19] know there's bride in here
[34:21] I know there's Brian in this message I
[34:23] know what brother Brown said now I call
[34:25] you bride not church he separated them
[34:27] Showdown that was a showdown one day and
[34:30] brother Brown said I call you bride
[34:33] I don't call you church anymore so the
[34:35] church goes to the tribulation the bride
[34:37] does not there was a showdown
[34:39] every time there was a showdown in
[34:40] brother round of his life there was a
[34:42] separation
[34:43] amen there was a separation he said I
[34:47] indict this generation thousands left
[34:49] him
[34:49] he come to marriage and divorce and he
[34:51] said go on as you are don't do it again
[34:53] you've been forgiven another separation
[34:56] he starts preaching the seals had never
[34:58] been preached before and the people are
[35:00] sitting there with their heads spinning
[35:01] another separation what it was a
[35:03] showdown it was a showdown on those
[35:05] sales where Satan had been hiding in
[35:08] religion he had been hiding in the
[35:11] message
[35:13] and there was a showdown and that
[35:15] Showdown was when the seals were open
[35:17] that Satan couldn't stand it anymore so
[35:19] he took off
[35:21] he exposed himself he went riding that's
[35:23] what I want to do I want him to be
[35:25] exposed not hide
[35:28] with a showdown Elijah said let God be
[35:33] God
[35:34] you call on yours I'll call on mine
[35:38] that's what we're coming to folks
[35:40] is a separation
[35:44] not manufacture Christianity you can't
[35:46] do it the first thing you've got to do
[35:48] is be born again you've got to be what
[35:51] changed and when you cha or changed you
[35:54] become a new creation now you're getting
[35:56] right now he said now you're getting
[35:59] right he didn't say you're always
[36:00] already completely right
[36:02] remember you're just getting started
[36:05] now you don't have to worry about the
[36:07] feathers he'll take care of itself he's
[36:08] talking about peacock feathers shoved
[36:10] into a Buzzard or a crow when you are
[36:15] born again yes sir like I've always said
[36:17] you take a hog scrub him up put a sailor
[36:19] suit on him or tuxedo rather and turn
[36:21] him out there he goes right to the mud
[36:23] hole and wallows that's what's wrong
[36:25] with me and you that's why we while we
[36:26] see people come in the building they get
[36:29] a good uh maybe a case of justification
[36:31] and sanctification but that nature is
[36:34] going to pop its head up it does not
[36:36] matter what you do the word of God will
[36:39] not you can't hide behind the word of
[36:40] God you can hide behind error
[36:43] but you can't hide behind the pure word
[36:45] of God that's why in the pure word of
[36:47] God's preached the head pops up
[36:51] and you get exposed that's what it is
[36:53] with a hog you look say well it looks
[36:55] pretty well let him go
[36:57] he's going right back to the mud
[37:00] because that's his nature wallowing is
[37:03] his nature you've got to change his
[37:06] nature
[37:07] and look and the rest of it will take
[37:09] care of itself
[37:11] changes nature put a lamb nature in him
[37:13] he'll never go to that Hollow wallow
[37:15] again
[37:17] why what inside of him don't want to go
[37:19] there anymore everybody with me
[37:21] all right now notice you must be born
[37:23] again that is change there's got to be a
[37:26] change
[37:28] folks I want you to realize your change
[37:31] everybody wants to get to the change of
[37:32] the body that's fine that's the
[37:34] culmination but if you don't get changed
[37:36] now you're not going to get changed
[37:37] there
[37:39] you got to get changed from the inside
[37:40] first your body change started on the
[37:43] day you got the Holy Ghost
[37:45] everybody with me on that
[37:50] because even if you have to go by the
[37:52] grave
[37:53] if you're born again you're coming up
[37:55] that body's going to be made Eternal
[37:57] it's going to be glorified and we're
[38:00] going into heaven or into that other
[38:02] dimension
[38:03] you say well brother random I know this
[38:05] certain woman over here why she never
[38:06] did anything wrong she's a good woman
[38:08] or this such a man he's a good man he
[38:11] never does anything you know he doesn't
[38:13] harm anybody that doesn't mean one thing
[38:17] he might make a good neighbor but he
[38:19] isn't a Christian until he's born again
[38:22] I hope that sinks in
[38:24] he isn't a Christian I'm gonna make the
[38:27] well that big enough for you all to see
[38:29] can you see that you see that in the
[38:31] back
[38:31] see they can't see that okay
[38:34] I don't want to be like Bob we have to
[38:36] squint see what's going on
[38:40] I do want to be like Bob I just want to
[38:42] be that way like Bob
[38:43] 's a good man
[38:45] he's got a good heart
[38:46] sometimes I wish they had a softer heart
[38:48] like him but I just made the way I am
[38:50] Jesus said except the man be born again
[38:52] look he can't even what see the kingdom
[38:56] that's why you have divisions now that's
[38:59] why you have false Doctrine now because
[39:01] listen the Holy Ghost is not a false
[39:03] Doctrine it will not tolerate a false
[39:07] Doctrine to a degree now listen you
[39:09] cannot know something for a little while
[39:10] but if you keep digging and you keep
[39:12] plowing and you keep listening you keep
[39:15] studying like Brother Richard uh up in
[39:18] Ohio the doubt of all that silly group
[39:22] in 2015 he said God I've had enough of
[39:26] this
[39:27] false Doctrine or something inside of me
[39:30] is just not ringing right
[39:32] how many have ever done that
[39:34] amen
[39:36] something you know what he done he said
[39:38] God
[39:39] show me the truth
[39:42] in other words you're obligated Lord if
[39:44] I need it
[39:46] truth you're
[39:48] into the story
[39:50] he pulls up brother Dale and he's been
[39:52] listening to him ever since
[39:54] amen
[39:55] they've been back listening now they're
[39:57] listening to the seals they're listening
[39:58] to all the backs uh sermons that we've
[40:01] all we've preached in here and they're
[40:02] really having a good time studying it
[40:04] studying it real good
[40:06] except a man be born again he cannot
[40:09] even see the kingdom that means c means
[40:11] understand
[40:12] you look at anything say I look I just
[40:15] don't see it you mean you don't
[40:17] understand it
[40:20] and it's okay not to understand I told
[40:22] him the story and I know Luis is
[40:24] standing back there looking through
[40:25] looking like a picture back there in the
[40:27] in the window
[40:30] but Luis will tell you brother Luis will
[40:33] tell you when he first came here
[40:35] it was hard for him to sit and listen
[40:38] right he's got his thumb up
[40:43] when you come from one this place over
[40:45] to this place
[40:47] and you listen to some good teaching but
[40:49] you got to stay here you gotta listen
[40:52] you got to grind it out
[40:54] I mean if you want to come here and just
[40:56] have a shout and good time you probably
[40:58] need to go somewhere else
[41:01] we do have them
[41:02] but the teaching it places us I want to
[41:05] be settled I want somebody when I'm that
[41:08] I know when the spirit does fall I know
[41:10] how to act instead of sitting there like
[41:12] this
[41:13] I know how to act the Holy Ghost inside
[41:15] of me knows how to act but I don't want
[41:18] to act up
[41:20] because the devil can act up
[41:22] I don't want the devil to I don't want
[41:24] that to happen to me but I want to be
[41:26] able to understand brother we said I sat
[41:27] there three months four months five
[41:29] months and he said I really didn't
[41:30] understand brother I didn't understand
[41:32] it might have been getting a little bit
[41:33] discouraged but all of a sudden
[41:36] praise God he stayed he endured those
[41:40] who endured to the end shall be saved
[41:43] listen this is not a picnic this is not
[41:46] a cruise ship this is a battleship
[41:49] it's a war everything's a war you walk
[41:52] in that doors of War Satan does not want
[41:54] you to know the word of God he does not
[41:56] want you to live right he definitely
[41:58] don't want you to come to church
[42:02] let's quit yielding to that
[42:04] but it says you mean you don't
[42:05] understand it
[42:07] that's okay not to understand but if you
[42:09] sit there long enough
[42:11] you sit there long enough
[42:13] endure to the endure those two hour hour
[42:16] and a half where you really don't
[42:18] understand a lot that's going on but if
[42:20] you stay there
[42:21] and just keep plowing
[42:23] just keep plowing
[42:25] how many have seen that I mean how many
[42:26] of you have seen two though some come in
[42:29] think they need to have this and that's
[42:30] okay because he gave some Apostles some
[42:32] prophets some families some pastors and
[42:34] some teachers
[42:35] I agree brother Louise will tell you
[42:37] he's standing back there now he did tell
[42:39] me one time that he he didn't know if he
[42:42] had the Holy Ghost but he knows he's got
[42:43] it now
[42:45] by the teaching of the word of God that
[42:47] he got the Holy Ghost by setting under a
[42:49] Ministry not that we had to lay hands on
[42:51] him and slap him and run him up down the
[42:53] aisle
[42:54] brother Dale preached the word of God
[42:56] day in day out day in day out and and
[43:00] and I'm getting like him I'm back
[43:02] grounded and he used to background for
[43:03] an hour and preach for 30 minutes that's
[43:05] fine
[43:07] because we didn't get it all
[43:09] right listen he's not backgrounding for
[43:11] himself I promise you that
[43:14] somebody say Amen
[43:15] okay
[43:17] but now God's got a call for us in this
[43:20] end time not to just stay the way we are
[43:22] not to just do like they did in the
[43:24] middle Church ages just give you life
[43:25] for the gospel had a very short lifespan
[43:27] in your Christianity if you were a
[43:29] Christian in the fourth Church age you
[43:31] said Christian you died the next day all
[43:33] right this is the long this is the
[43:35] longevity this is the part that's going
[43:36] to be the long part that we've got to
[43:38] what March we've got to keep going
[43:41] please keep going don't stop
[43:44] the devil would love for you to stop
[43:49] but therefore leaving the principles of
[43:50] the doctrine of Christ let us go on into
[43:52] what perfection
[43:54] completion
[43:56] not laying again the foundation of
[43:58] repentance from dead works and the faith
[44:00] toward God
[44:01] of the doctrine of baptism of laying on
[44:03] of hands and resurrection of the dead of
[44:06] Eternal judgment look and this will we
[44:09] do if God permits
[44:12] and he has permitted by one way
[44:15] there's only one way he has permitted
[44:17] this and it's Ephesians 4 11. and he
[44:20] gave some Apostles some prophets some
[44:21] evangelists and some pastors and
[44:23] teachers what for the perfecting of the
[44:25] Saints look for not for the perfecting
[44:28] of the world not for the perfecting of
[44:30] the Justified
[44:33] you're not perfected until you're born
[44:35] again
[44:36] so this is talking about teachers and
[44:38] preachers and evangelists and pastors
[44:40] and Prophets that are preaching to
[44:42] people that are being perfected the
[44:44] saints that are being perfected I know
[44:46] there's one thing for sure there are
[44:48] babies born now
[44:50] all right
[44:51] yeah
[44:54] man there's babies that are born that's
[44:57] okay
[44:58] but you can't stay babies though
[45:01] the Bible tells us I was reading it the
[45:03] other day where where the Lord tells us
[45:05] that there's a former and a lot of rain
[45:07] and it's going to fall in the same month
[45:09] there's going to be a short work
[45:12] all of you are our babies
[45:14] you have the ability to what come from
[45:18] milk to meat real quick some of us it
[45:20] took a long time right
[45:22] foreign
[45:29] at least you know that
[45:31] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[45:33] work of the what the work of the
[45:34] ministry for the edifying of what the
[45:37] whole body not just one person the whole
[45:40] body is going to be edified we're all
[45:42] gonna what benefit from this Apostle
[45:45] Prophet Pastor teacher and evangelist
[45:47] way that God has done it to get his word
[45:51] to the people
[45:52] till we all come to the white Unity of
[45:55] the faith and of the knowledge of the
[45:58] Son of God unto a perfect man that's the
[46:01] statue right there we're looking at unto
[46:03] what the measure of the stature of the
[46:04] fullness of Christ look that we
[46:07] henceforth be no more children
[46:09] toss to and fro
[46:12] carried about with every wind of
[46:13] Doctrine
[46:14] by what by the slight of preachers
[46:19] false preachers
[46:22] by the slight of false preachers and
[46:25] cunning craftiness that Devil he's
[46:27] cunning he's crafty whereby look they
[46:30] lie and wait to deceive
[46:33] Paul was telling us they're going to be
[46:35] there
[46:36] to deceive you
[46:38] Paul said Grievous wolves are coming and
[46:41] are already among you back in the first
[46:43] church age
[46:47] May what grow up and in Him in all
[46:50] things
[46:51] which is the head even crossed from whom
[46:54] the whole body fitly joined together we
[46:56] were talking about this a little bit
[46:57] this weekend everything has to be fit
[47:00] together because look folks if there's
[47:01] one little hole
[47:03] if there's one little tiny hole the
[47:07] devil's going to stick his finger in it
[47:11] he'll disrupt he'll capture that whole
[47:13] thing if you'll let him stick his finger
[47:15] in it so we need to cut it off come
[47:17] packed
[47:18] compact it together what Wednesday night
[47:21] Sunday night prayer meeting prayer
[47:23] service praying in your closet talking
[47:25] about the word of God what is he doing
[47:27] I promise you one thing the devil didn't
[47:29] make you do that
[47:34] and compacted by that which what every
[47:36] joint supplies
[47:38] man what if you didn't have your joints
[47:42] imagine not having a joint in your body
[47:45] you'd be just a statue
[47:49] you wouldn't be able to do this this
[47:51] move your fingers you'd be no have no
[47:53] joy but listen we have joints and we are
[47:56] going he's going to supply every joint
[48:00] sometimes I wish he'd supplies get this
[48:03] arthritis out of all these joints in the
[48:04] old people said hey man
[48:07] I'll tell you what you get that burning
[48:09] sensation and it ain't nice
[48:11] no that's right according to the fact
[48:14] you're working in the measure of what
[48:15] every part
[48:17] deacons elders
[48:20] people in the church service people
[48:22] studying people praying
[48:25] and what maketh increase of the body
[48:27] that's us the body the body's not me the
[48:29] body's all of us right all right unto
[48:32] the what edifying of itself in love you
[48:35] don't edify from the from the world you
[48:38] don't edify from that body that's out
[48:40] there because Satan's got a body too
[48:43] he's got a body out there there's like
[48:45] God's got a body in here
[48:47] hidden life in Christ now watch
[48:52] I'm talking about the high priest
[48:53] entering in congregation followed him up
[48:55] when he went in this great place the
[48:57] veil dropped the holy of holies what a
[49:01] beautiful picture it is today of the
[49:02] consecrated life who once enters into
[49:04] with Christ dead to the things of the
[49:07] world
[49:08] hit away with God and the veils drop
[49:11] down around and all the world shut off
[49:13] now there's the renewing of your mind
[49:16] and then Christianity and religion
[49:18] become a pleasure to every believer a
[49:21] pleasure to every believer
[49:24] listen
[49:25] it's a paradox almost you you say well
[49:28] it is easy to be a believer
[49:30] but you got to struggle like I said
[49:32] before it's a battle it's not a picnic
[49:33] all right but it becomes a pleasure to
[49:36] every believer what in the world could
[49:37] this world give us even longevity of
[49:40] life even if they even if they had a
[49:42] pill to take away arthritis Lord please
[49:44] bring it
[49:46] but the young kids are going what's
[49:48] talking about
[49:50] don't worry I hope you don't get bigger
[49:52] or old enough to realize it I promise
[49:55] you that I hope the Lord took us all to
[49:57] the house amen
[49:59] but becomes a pleasure to every believer
[50:01] today people just get enough religion to
[50:03] make them miserable knowing they ought
[50:05] to do this they're trying to escape hell
[50:07] I hope you're not trying to escape hell
[50:09] tonight
[50:12] well if that's the way I felt about
[50:13] brother I don't know what I'd do
[50:16] so now let's look make sure we
[50:17] understand we're in the dispensation now
[50:20] of the Son of God is that right say Amen
[50:22] seven Church ages in time that's where
[50:26] the Son of God Revelation is going to be
[50:29] made known and then we go then when we
[50:31] get through with the virtues now what
[50:34] are the virtues the virtues or that
[50:36] second stage of sanctification where
[50:39] it's not just clean and set aside for
[50:40] service
[50:41] before you're born again it's cleaned
[50:44] and set aside where Paul says I Die
[50:46] daily because we have trash sister
[50:48] Shepard had trash still inside of her
[50:51] sticks remember old dead sticks we
[50:54] talked preached on Old dead sticks but
[50:56] God's gonna take those dead sticks and
[50:58] make you live he's going to give you
[51:00] life
[51:02] one more time folks there's nothing in
[51:03] the world no drug no nothing there's
[51:05] nothing
[51:07] Eternal down here
[51:09] oh I want to have pleasure in this world
[51:11] for a season Moses could have done that
[51:14] himself but Moses even without the Holy
[51:16] Ghost
[51:18] that's right even without the new birth
[51:20] Moses said I don't want that give me
[51:23] those two million Rebels and 40 years in
[51:26] the wilderness I'll take that over that
[51:28] any day
[51:30] that's what you got to see why but
[51:32] that's a renewing your mind that's why
[51:33] people around us think we're crazy
[51:36] why do you have to do this
[51:38] why do you well we go to church when we
[51:40] need to yeah that's exactly right
[51:44] we don't we don't have to like uh
[51:47] something said well y'all are living the
[51:49] Old Testament and we're living in the
[51:51] New Testament
[51:52] oh Heavenly days
[51:54] the New Testament I thought magnified
[51:56] the Old Testament
[51:57] and Jesus said I didn't come to destroy
[51:59] the law come to magnify and make it
[52:02] honorable he said I say unto you that
[52:04] you don't have to because I had one guy
[52:05] tell me one time
[52:07] tell you how the Lord works if you'll
[52:09] keep your mouth shut every once in a
[52:10] while
[52:12] okay I'm quiet
[52:15] so I had this guy we were talking about
[52:17] the the hair in the dress you know
[52:19] Deuteronomy 29 we're talking about the
[52:20] dress
[52:22] and he said well actually test him and I
[52:24] said well you know Ten Commandments are
[52:25] in the Old Testament too
[52:26] I said but we try we we don't do away
[52:29] with either one we live the way that
[52:31] you're supposed to live I said how many
[52:32] times have you seen we were looking at
[52:34] some old pictures one time from about
[52:36] 1950 backwards they weren't a woman with
[52:39] a dress with a pair of pants on that I
[52:40] saw except maybe somebody in Hollywood
[52:42] or somewhere like that I mean even when
[52:44] the girls went to school the school
[52:46] pictures the women had on dresses man so
[52:49] what's changed
[52:51] a Doctrine change somewhere
[52:53] all right because it what was becoming
[52:56] of the woman to wear her clothes and
[52:58] becoming of a man to where his
[53:00] he said well now if you're going to live
[53:02] the Old Testament he said
[53:04] what are you going to do about somebody
[53:06] commits adultery are you gonna are you
[53:08] gonna take it take them out and stone
[53:10] them
[53:11] you know because that's what they did in
[53:12] the Old Testament
[53:14] they physically did it
[53:16] they physically killed people back then
[53:19] but oh thank God
[53:22] we got a Holy Ghost
[53:24] and it brought back to my memory Jesus
[53:26] was standing there one day and he said I
[53:28] say unto you
[53:29] he said
[53:31] if you have all against your brother and
[53:34] you in other words you speak against him
[53:35] you've already killed him
[53:38] see so that's the stoning part
[53:40] he magnified it
[53:43] he magnified Jesus stood there and
[53:46] didn't say now don't Stone them no
[53:47] you're stoning them with your mouth now
[53:49] you're not having to Stone them with and
[53:51] remember brother random even comes up
[53:53] and tells us he says look he said You
[53:55] Killed the influence of a man you've
[53:56] killed the person you've killed you've
[53:58] killed the individual without having to
[53:59] Stone him with stones
[54:01] you kill him by the influence of your
[54:03] mouth and now what that magnified the
[54:06] Old Testament listen we have the old and
[54:09] new both together we know that but the
[54:11] world they look at us and they think we
[54:12] live the old
[54:16] what they don't know is
[54:18] it took the New Testament
[54:21] and the Old Testament to make you and I
[54:24] born again
[54:25] we didn't get born again just because of
[54:27] the New Testament it talks about it all
[54:29] through the Old Testament come on people
[54:31] all the way back from Genesis and
[54:33] Abraham's journey I was listening
[54:34] brother Brown just a little while ago he
[54:36] said to Abraham that was the whole
[54:38] journey of a Christian was Abraham in
[54:41] the Old Testament
[54:43] all the way down we come all the way
[54:45] through those old prophets and different
[54:46] ones they what they were given what the
[54:49] Bible says for our example
[54:52] amen
[54:53] so that's why we we what our mind has
[54:56] been renewed
[54:58] our mind's been renewed to think those
[55:00] thoughts not think the thoughts I was
[55:02] watching uh listening to brother random
[55:04] we were coming home day before yesterday
[55:06] and he was talking about that tax case
[55:08] somebody was you know they were beating
[55:10] him on something he said he said if
[55:12] you'll just stay still long enough he
[55:13] said got to give you what to say and he
[55:15] just gave him exactly what they're
[55:16] saying the man said oh I'm sorry brother
[55:18] Brandon we won't do that anymore we
[55:19] won't you know get on to you for that
[55:21] so maybe sometimes we need to just
[55:23] listen instead of trying to and it's
[55:25] always it's a it's a what do they call
[55:27] it the fight or flight
[55:28] if somebody says something to you go
[55:32] hey man come on somebody
[55:36] Oh I thought you was disagreeing with me
[55:46] hey man
[55:48] we want to what
[55:50] snap back
[55:53] but if we just wait just a minute
[55:55] the Bible tells us he'll tell us what to
[55:58] say
[55:59] and you know what you won't even have to
[56:00] think about what you're going to say
[56:02] you'll say it if you'll just stay calm
[56:05] what renewing of your mind your own
[56:07] nature wants to get to not have
[56:10] brotherly kindness and you want to
[56:11] actually Stone the guy
[56:13] or sister
[56:16] with your words
[56:18] so I said we're going to be I I just
[56:21] pray in a year we're all different we
[56:22] all think different act different if
[56:24] we're here another year
[56:25] I want us to act different think
[56:27] different
[56:31] know the leading of the Lord
[56:34] and not have to ask
[56:37] why are we doing that
[56:39] but that what happened in the first
[56:41] three Church ages
[56:43] brother Brown said that one little nod
[56:45] from God
[56:47] Paul look at Paul
[56:49] now Paul had brotherly kindness
[56:52] you know why there was a woman followed
[56:54] him and there was a man followed him and
[56:56] then he talks about this other sorcerer
[56:58] and all that they hit people around him
[57:00] all the time
[57:01] and he let that woman and finally
[57:02] somebody said hey how long are you gonna
[57:03] let that woman do that
[57:05] and finally he had enough and he turned
[57:07] around and spoke to her and spoke to the
[57:09] people
[57:10] what he waited on the Lord to get that
[57:13] nod from God just like brother Branham
[57:15] did with that guy that was going to kill
[57:16] him
[57:17] and all the different things you know he
[57:19] kept calm
[57:22] power and control
[57:24] so that's what we're looking at when we
[57:25] go through virtue and all his temper's
[57:27] patience I want us to what I read the
[57:29] scripture how to what possess possess
[57:31] means to control
[57:33] when you're possessed of something
[57:35] you're controlled of it right
[57:36] amen there are some people that um that
[57:39] are possessed of football and different
[57:41] things and man they just go to the
[57:42] extreme why can't we go to the extreme
[57:44] for something that's eternal
[57:46] hey you don't have to pay 150 to get
[57:49] into these seats
[57:54] just saying
[57:55] but we've come to all this and we want
[57:57] to see that that sanctification the
[57:59] second stage of sanctification is what
[58:01] it's knocking the the the faults out
[58:05] putting that virtue into where that
[58:07] virtue can come out to where that
[58:09] knowledge and it's really Holy Ghost
[58:11] knowledge not your own knowledge man has
[58:14] used their own knowledge and brought
[58:15] what Creed's denominations it has
[58:18] brought death to the church
[58:21] by their own knowledge they've used
[58:23] their own knowledge by their own words
[58:26] by their own Jesus told them said I read
[58:28] it a long time ago where he says you've
[58:31] made what the word of God of no effect
[58:35] because of your tradition
[58:37] but what is a tradition it's a knowledge
[58:39] of well we did this and we did that we
[58:40] did this we did that we're Moses's
[58:43] children
[58:44] we got Moses's quote book we got all
[58:46] five of the
[58:48] the Torah right
[58:51] we've got 1100 sermons
[58:54] we have 1100 different Doctrine
[58:58] out of those 1100 sermons we don't but
[59:01] it is in the message
[59:03] amen
[59:04] but there's going to be one truth and
[59:05] there's always just one truth
[59:07] he said I am the way the truth and the
[59:09] life
[59:10] and that's what brother uh Richard was
[59:12] was praying and in other words he was
[59:14] talking to us the other day and he said
[59:16] Lord he said you told me that you would
[59:17] lead me and guide me into all
[59:20] all truth
[59:22] not just part truth all truth and he's
[59:25] held on to that for all these years
[59:29] I just hope we can hang on
[59:31] amen
[59:34] this is a crock pot
[59:35] not a microwave
[59:41] yeah but I'm hungry I want to put a
[59:43] stick back away
[59:46] no give me a crock pot
[59:48] because I want that sanctification
[59:49] because watch before we let me I'm
[59:52] trying to back up a minute before we
[59:54] before we get through with this statue
[59:56] of perfect man remember there's going to
[59:58] be brother Brown said there's going to
[59:59] be a holy spirit that what in other
[1:00:01] words
[1:00:02] melts down through this and if there's
[1:00:05] any cracks that starts filling them in
[1:00:07] because Steve remember there's still
[1:00:09] going to be little things that we got to
[1:00:10] get rid of this is not a
[1:00:12] like water filling up and we're going to
[1:00:15] try to get all this right here but now
[1:00:17] we can't get no knowledge until we get
[1:00:19] this right here no these lines are just
[1:00:21] what they're just lines to show the
[1:00:23] difference
[1:00:24] it's not lines to show because you take
[1:00:26] virtue and you still got to have virtue
[1:00:29] flowing through all this brother around
[1:00:30] calls it flowing
[1:00:32] all this knowledge flowing but you got
[1:00:34] to start here for a foundation and then
[1:00:38] get virtue then knowledge and they're
[1:00:40] exactly the way they're supposed to be
[1:00:42] and we'll see that when we get started
[1:00:44] if that's all right
[1:00:45] when we get started on the virtues
[1:00:47] because virtue is what virtue is not
[1:00:49] being a virgin it's being virtuous
[1:00:53] it's where you go and you if you get in
[1:00:55] trouble with with if you get in trouble
[1:00:57] with the Lord
[1:00:59] you don't go to the corner convenience
[1:01:01] store guy and ask him to pray for you
[1:01:04] you call Brother Dale you call Brother
[1:01:06] Bob call brother Aaron because you have
[1:01:08] what confidence that they're full of
[1:01:10] virtue
[1:01:12] now that got the corner convenience
[1:01:14] store is full of something but it ain't
[1:01:15] the virtue that you need amen
[1:01:19] listen you're either full of God or the
[1:01:21] devil I'm there's no way in between
[1:01:22] folks I don't know why we've got this
[1:01:24] denominational idea that we're all going
[1:01:26] to go to heaven because we're good
[1:01:27] people
[1:01:29] and the hell's not here anymore we just
[1:01:31] all in a message and we're all going
[1:01:33] come on big deception folks
[1:01:39] who was it yesterday or what no it was
[1:01:41] this weekend somebody I can't remember
[1:01:43] who it was in Ohio said it scared them
[1:01:45] to read anointed ones at the end time
[1:01:48] we were talking to somebody I said it
[1:01:50] scared me
[1:01:51] don't read annoying once at the end time
[1:01:53] it don't scare you too
[1:01:59] detect if it were possible so close
[1:02:01] Judas and Jesus right there together
[1:02:04] nobody knew it but the son of man that's
[1:02:07] why we got to get to that son of man
[1:02:08] Revelation and then there's a real show
[1:02:11] down then brother Brown calls it a Mount
[1:02:13] Zion Showdown
[1:02:15] right it's not about Transfiguration
[1:02:18] it's not a Mount Carmel that was a
[1:02:20] separation but when you get to Mount
[1:02:21] Zion what is Mount Zion that's Jerusalem
[1:02:24] sitting on a hill
[1:02:26] that's our possession
[1:02:28] it separates
[1:02:32] Matthew 10 says he that loveth father
[1:02:34] and mother more than me is not worthy of
[1:02:36] me he that loveth son or daughter more
[1:02:38] than me is not worthy of me
[1:02:40] and he that taketh not his cross we were
[1:02:43] talking about this remember there are
[1:02:45] some that deny the cross or hate the
[1:02:46] cross some that come to the cross and
[1:02:48] some that bear the cross now you and I
[1:02:50] when we start up this statue of perfect
[1:02:51] man we're going to be carrying your
[1:02:53] cross
[1:02:55] you're going to be carrying your cross
[1:02:56] all right he that taketh not his cross
[1:02:59] and followeth after me is not worthy of
[1:03:01] me he that findeth his life shall lose
[1:03:04] it he that loses his life for my sake
[1:03:07] she'll find it Luke 9 verse 23 and he
[1:03:10] said unto them all if any man will come
[1:03:12] after me let him deny himself and take
[1:03:14] up his cross daily
[1:03:17] pick that beam up
[1:03:19] put it on your shoulders
[1:03:22] you saw the world to laugh at me praise
[1:03:24] God
[1:03:26] praise God I want the world and I'm
[1:03:29] different
[1:03:35] not just take it because daily
[1:03:37] but follow me
[1:03:40] not just take it up
[1:03:42] but follow him
[1:03:46] and listen there's a lot of people took
[1:03:48] up a cross and went to a father-son Holy
[1:03:50] Ghost
[1:03:51] right right
[1:03:53] a two Soul Doctrine
[1:03:55] of this Doctrine can't get Daniel 70
[1:03:58] weeks right can't get this right
[1:04:02] but there's one truth
[1:04:04] there's one cross and it's his that you
[1:04:07] have to bear you have to bear your cross
[1:04:09] but we have to follow him
[1:04:11] and who is he in the beginning was the
[1:04:13] word where the garden where it was God
[1:04:15] he's the word of God
[1:04:16] he was the walking word what are me and
[1:04:18] you we're the walking word
[1:04:20] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:04:22] lose it oh I don't know I I don't know
[1:04:26] if I want to raise my hands or not
[1:04:29] somebody might say something
[1:04:31] I hope they do
[1:04:35] I hope they do
[1:04:38] I hope they say those people are crazy
[1:04:42] Paul said in a way it's called heresy
[1:04:46] craziness
[1:04:47] do I serve God
[1:04:50] hey two weeks ago if you'd have brought
[1:04:52] two or three four five or six
[1:04:53] denominational people in here they would
[1:04:56] have thought was crazy
[1:04:57] amen and some of you sat there like a
[1:05:00] bump on the pickle
[1:05:02] what's worth what's a bump on a pickle
[1:05:04] worth but whosoever will ever will fly
[1:05:07] from my sake the same shall save it
[1:05:10] First Corinthians 15 says I protest by
[1:05:13] your rejoicing which I have in Christ
[1:05:15] Jesus our lord I Die daily
[1:05:19] there's something that you're
[1:05:21] confronting
[1:05:23] every day
[1:05:25] you brought something that you got to
[1:05:27] make a choice or God's going to speak to
[1:05:29] you about something and you're either
[1:05:30] going to take it or deny it
[1:05:32] every day every day of your life
[1:05:36] they don't care even if you're on
[1:05:38] vacation
[1:05:39] even you know if you're off somewhere
[1:05:41] hunting or something
[1:05:44] bro Dale's got some powerful sermons
[1:05:46] while he's up in a tree
[1:05:48] amen so he's talking to God talking to
[1:05:50] him
[1:05:51] oh that's dummies working around to get
[1:05:53] all of his attention

[1:06:01] generation

[1:06:09] God
[1:06:10] that you should show forth what the
[1:06:12] Praises of him who has called you out of
[1:06:14] Darkness Into His Marvelous Light
[1:06:17] which in times past look we're not a
[1:06:19] people

[1:06:23] doing the things you did in the world
[1:06:25] you were potentially there you were by
[1:06:27] for knowledge you were there yes but in
[1:06:30] your Humanity you were lost
[1:06:33] doomed and on your way to hell
[1:06:35] which in times past you are not a people
[1:06:37] but are now the people of God which had
[1:06:40] not look obtained Mercy but now have
[1:06:42] obtained Mercy dearly beloved I just

[1:07:50] glorify God in the day of visitation
[1:07:52] listen today is our day of visitation we
[1:07:55] were visited by
[1:07:58] a messenger
[1:08:00] and we're supposed to be the final voice

[1:08:15] well I'll just separate myself and
[1:08:16] remember brother I'm got in trouble with
[1:08:18] God for that
[1:08:20] he said God I just want to go up in a
[1:08:23] cave
[1:08:24] have long hair and a beard and just run
[1:08:27] out and say thus saith the Lord and turn
[1:08:29] around and run back in
[1:08:31] God told him said no I didn't bring you
[1:08:33] to do that
[1:08:35] I brought you to live among these people
[1:08:37] because they're your people and you're
[1:08:39] supposed to teach them not just run out
[1:08:41] there and condemn them every few minutes
[1:08:42] you got Grace involved with this thing
[1:08:45] thank God
[1:08:48] laughs
[1:08:49] aren't the governors as unto them
[1:08:50] they're sent for the punishment of
[1:08:51] evildoers and for the praise of them to
[1:08:53] do well I want you to watch now this is
[1:08:54] where I got my thought about separation
[1:08:57] or Showdown for look for so is the will
[1:09:00] of God now here is the will of God you
[1:09:02] want to know what the will of God is we
[1:09:04] know it's the word of God all right so
[1:09:06] the word of God tells us that with
[1:09:08] well-doing you may put to silence
[1:09:11] how many of you want to silence the
[1:09:13] devil how many of you want to silence
[1:09:15] that jerk in your life amen I'm tired of
[1:09:18] that thing
[1:09:19] ringing loud in my ear
[1:09:21] you can't do this you can't do that you
[1:09:23] ain't worthy of this and remember what
[1:09:25] you did remember what you didn't do
[1:09:28] but let's burn this scripture in your
[1:09:30] mind for so is the will of God that with
[1:09:33] well-doing
[1:09:35] yes yes you may put to silence the
[1:09:39] ignorance of foolish man
[1:09:42] as a church as an individual the only
[1:09:45] way to silence a Critic is to live the
[1:09:48] word of God
[1:09:50] you oh you say well now wait a minute
[1:09:55] I can get me 52 quotes and if I can get
[1:09:58] 52 and this one only gets 42 I won
[1:10:02] that ain't it right
[1:10:04] right that ain't it quotes will kill you
[1:10:07] if it's not what filter to a life
[1:10:11] but we want to put the silence the
[1:10:14] ignorance of foolish men guess what
[1:10:16] happened on Mount Carmel
[1:10:19] hey folks
[1:10:21] Elijah literally silenced those prophets
[1:10:25] of Baal
[1:10:27] I always wondered how one man could take
[1:10:30] 400 prophets down to the brook Kidron
[1:10:32] which is little bitty Brook ain't very
[1:10:33] much big and he killed them all
[1:10:36] he killed him he didn't just talk to him
[1:10:39] he killed him
[1:10:41] well what he done was is the
[1:10:43] congregation that was around him started
[1:10:44] believing what Elijah said
[1:10:46] they saw the fire they saw what happened
[1:10:49] to the 400 prophets it cut theirself and
[1:10:51] jumped all over the place and shouted
[1:10:53] in tongues
[1:10:55] and all Elijah stand over there going
[1:10:58] to talk a little louder
[1:11:00] maybe your God's on vacation
[1:11:03] uh maybe he's went on a journey and he
[1:11:05] ain't got but he can't hear what you're
[1:11:06] saying he was taunting them why he knew
[1:11:09] who he was he knew where he stood and he
[1:11:13] knew that God was going to fulfill his
[1:11:14] promise because he told Elijah Elijah
[1:11:16] looked up and said God at your word I'm
[1:11:18] going to do this
[1:11:20] fire came down and what it Vindicated
[1:11:22] who Elijah was but he totally silenced
[1:11:25] those 400 prophets of Baal
[1:11:27] everybody with me
[1:11:29] so we're going to try to now as a church
[1:11:31] as individuals as people that go to
[1:11:33] Spoken Word Church
[1:11:34] we're going to silence the ignorance of
[1:11:36] foolish men
[1:11:38] how are you going to do it
[1:11:40] let's read
[1:11:43] little babies
[1:11:45] gotta start somewhere
[1:11:46] I got one back there just learning to
[1:11:48] walk now that had to be Joseph because
[1:11:50] that's 1953 I would assume because he
[1:11:52] said he'd Boop whatever Boop means and
[1:11:56] fall down get back up and he thought he
[1:11:58] was doing something great
[1:12:00] I was that way one day
[1:12:02] but now I'm a man
[1:12:04] I put away childish things
[1:12:07] now we got to come to full
[1:12:10] Doctrine
[1:12:12] I like good old shouting meetings where
[1:12:15] we clap our hands or shout have a good
[1:12:17] time have great powerful services and
[1:12:19] things dance on the bubble as it were
[1:12:21] but wait
[1:12:23] then when The Showdown time comes you
[1:12:26] don't know where you're standing
[1:12:28] everybody understand what he's saying
[1:12:30] it's kind of hard to follow him but what
[1:12:31] he's saying is he said I love all this
[1:12:33] but when he comes to The Showdown you
[1:12:34] better know where you're standing
[1:12:36] it's not all that dancing and all that
[1:12:38] that's good that's what that's emotion
[1:12:40] that's that's feeling that comes what
[1:12:42] after we knew what the doctrine was
[1:12:45] but wait then when The Showdown time
[1:12:48] comes you don't know where you're
[1:12:49] standing let's get back and find out
[1:12:51] let's find out what's making us do that
[1:12:55] all right find out what's making us do
[1:12:58] that
[1:13:00] I found out what was making us do that
[1:13:02] two weeks ago it was the Holy Ghost
[1:13:05] finally somebody said hey use me
[1:13:11] let's find out what's making us do that
[1:13:13] let's get back to the foundation
[1:13:17] see where we're at
[1:13:20] hmm speak to the Rock 1960.
[1:13:25] we'll have a meeting like this morning
[1:13:26] we were having a meeting
[1:13:28] there in the Holy Ghost falling into
[1:13:29] place to people screaming shouting
[1:13:31] praising the Lord
[1:13:33] then someone come up and said pray for
[1:13:35] me brother Brandon I laid hands on him
[1:13:36] and prayed for him I said now go and
[1:13:38] believe
[1:13:39] now look
[1:13:40] now here's what it is
[1:13:43] it's easy to feel the power of God
[1:13:45] to see it when you believe
[1:13:48] but then when it comes to The Showdown
[1:13:52] are you able to possess the things that
[1:13:55] you profess to have
[1:13:59] remember brother Brown said it don't
[1:14:00] matter how high you jump
[1:14:02] said when you get down can you walk what
[1:14:04] you jump for
[1:14:06] all right are you able to possess the
[1:14:09] things that you profess to have
[1:14:12] because it's going to be a showdown that
[1:14:14] to me that's what brother I'm saying let
[1:14:15] out what's inside of you it's going to
[1:14:18] come out
[1:14:19] you can hold it all you want to but it's
[1:14:20] going to blow the top of your head off
[1:14:22] one of these days good or bad
[1:14:25] that's the thing brother we've got to
[1:14:27] get it we've got to take it it's ours
[1:14:29] but you'll fight for every inch
[1:14:35] Fellowship 1962.
[1:14:38] we're all tried
[1:14:40] every Christian every son every child
[1:14:42] that comes to God is Tried by the word
[1:14:44] to see if you'll be loyal to it
[1:14:47] who's going to try you God's going to
[1:14:49] try you
[1:14:50] he's going to let the devil loose on you
[1:14:57] don't kill him
[1:14:59] don't touch your soul
[1:15:02] but you can have his flesh
[1:15:04] job
[1:15:05] amen that's what he said so you can't
[1:15:08] kill him that's my job
[1:15:10] but you do whatever you need to do I'm
[1:15:12] gonna prove who he is that's what's
[1:15:13] going to happen now
[1:15:14] every child that comes to God is Tried
[1:15:17] by the word
[1:15:18] see if you'll be loyal to it when The
[1:15:20] Showdown come
[1:15:21] what decision are you going to make
[1:15:25] that's it and he that cannot stand
[1:15:27] chastisement but goes on with the world
[1:15:30] he's an illegitimate child
[1:15:33] a bastard
[1:15:35] and not a son and daughter of God
[1:15:37] certainly not now but the spiritual
[1:15:40] minded catches the word look lines up
[1:15:43] with it and the spirit comes down under
[1:15:45] the shed blood and takes that person
[1:15:49] take me
[1:15:51] take me
[1:15:54] if God don't take you the devil will
[1:15:57] that was a near Kinsman remember Ruth
[1:16:00] was probably worried there for a little
[1:16:02] while
[1:16:03] here come Boaz and said oh I'll redeem
[1:16:05] you Ruth but I gotta go talk to one more
[1:16:08] because there's one near Kinsman
[1:16:11] than I am to you or to Naomi
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:15] there's one one one I got to go talk to
[1:16:18] and if he does it then I gotta give it
[1:16:19] to him
[1:16:21] and remember that was a devil
[1:16:24] in type
[1:16:26] your flesh he's got a mark on you
[1:16:29] because you were born in sand shaping
[1:16:31] and iniquity you came here lost and he
[1:16:34] has dibs on this flesh part of you
[1:16:37] but when Boaz thank God what a mighty
[1:16:40] God we serve bull acid all right you're
[1:16:42] going to redeem it and said yeah we're
[1:16:44] damn it
[1:16:45] and Boaz says no
[1:16:53] you're gonna get the mole bonus too
[1:16:56] you're going to get the Gentile
[1:16:59] because remember it wasn't Ruth it was
[1:17:00] redeemed
[1:17:03] it was Naomi Naomi was the Jew she was
[1:17:05] the
[1:17:07] old was married in oh praise God Ruth
[1:17:10] and married into the family
[1:17:13] to the Gentile more about us
[1:17:16] get brother Brown said
[1:17:18] we know how moabs
[1:17:19] apps to playing that read your Bible
[1:17:22] but that man boy I said hey if you take
[1:17:26] Naomi you gotta take Ruth
[1:17:29] and the devil's like
[1:17:31] I don't think I want that Gentile bride
[1:17:34] I don't want her
[1:17:36] I don't even like her I don't want
[1:17:39] anything to do with her
[1:17:41] he said you can do it boy I said okay I
[1:17:43] got you
[1:17:45] I'm gonna kick my shoe off
[1:17:47] and I'm gonna go to Earth
[1:17:53] I'm gonna kick my shoe off
[1:17:55] I'm gonna kick my eternal being off for
[1:17:59] a little while and I'm gonna go down in
[1:18:00] human flesh and I'm gonna buy them back
[1:18:02] and I'm gonna buy them all back I'm
[1:18:05] gonna take Gentiles and Jews back devil
[1:18:08] you don't have anything to do with this
[1:18:10] anymore because you have what forfeited
[1:18:12] you're right
[1:18:14] thank God when we can put the devil in
[1:18:16] his place when God through us can put
[1:18:19] the devil in his place let me put it
[1:18:20] that way we're no match for the devil
[1:18:21] but God inside of us is
[1:18:25] it was a paradox when the Hebrew
[1:18:27] children were thrown in the fire furnace
[1:18:29] and I want you to realize this
[1:18:31] this is something that you probably have
[1:18:33] never thought of
[1:18:35] unless you've read this
[1:18:37] this paradox
[1:18:39] we look at the attitude of that this
[1:18:42] don't wait a minute some of y'all are
[1:18:43] reading that don't read that
[1:18:45] I saw your eyes looking over there
[1:18:48] starting to read it
[1:18:50] show these three Hebrew
[1:18:53] chip you know the story behind them they
[1:18:55] said we're not going to bow
[1:18:57] to this image
[1:18:59] and Nebuchadnezzar said okay well then
[1:19:01] I've got to do what I got to do I've
[1:19:02] done said if you don't bow down you're
[1:19:04] going to go get put into the fiery
[1:19:07] furnace all right now when God puts me
[1:19:09] and you in the same position what do we
[1:19:10] do we start crying and screaming and
[1:19:12] they have to drag us to the furnace
[1:19:15] come on somebody
[1:19:17] them three Hebrew children said come on
[1:19:19] you know what they got a revelation of
[1:19:21] that what was binding them
[1:19:27] come on
[1:19:28] what was binding then was the only thing
[1:19:31] that was going to be burnt off
[1:19:34] if you look at it that way your trials
[1:19:36] will
[1:19:39] so now let's read the quote
[1:19:41] all right you ready it was a paradox
[1:19:45] when the three Hebrew children were
[1:19:46] thrown into the fire furnace how the
[1:19:48] three men could walk it walk into a
[1:19:50] furnace
[1:19:52] so hot that the intense heat even kill
[1:19:54] the men that were pushing them in and
[1:19:56] yet they stayed in that only delivered
[1:19:59] them
[1:19:59] that's the only thing it did it
[1:20:01] delivered them from the bonds that they
[1:20:03] were bound with
[1:20:06] your trial will deliver you from the
[1:20:09] barns that you've been bound with if
[1:20:11] you'll let it so you got to go into
[1:20:13] fiery furnace you can't turn and go the
[1:20:15] other direction
[1:20:16] sometimes in our lives that Paradox
[1:20:18] repeats sometimes you're brought to a
[1:20:20] showdown where you have to make a
[1:20:23] decision
[1:20:24] adventurous
[1:20:26] you're going to make a decision God's
[1:20:28] going to make you make a decision
[1:20:30] amen this word is going to make you make
[1:20:33] a decision one way or the other you have
[1:20:35] to stand on that decision like they did
[1:20:38] and it all works together for the good
[1:20:40] what did it do it never hurt them it
[1:20:42] loosed them
[1:20:45] oh that's gonna I mean people stand
[1:20:47] around them the other congregation
[1:20:50] standing around going man they gonna get
[1:20:52] just I mean they're going to be like
[1:20:54] fried chicken they're going to get burnt
[1:20:55] up
[1:20:57] burnt to a crisp seven times hotter I
[1:20:59] bet that thing was just glowing you
[1:21:00] don't have something when you burn how
[1:21:02] it just glows yeah
[1:21:04] we used to burn stuff over June's dad's
[1:21:06] house and he had the thing about this
[1:21:07] house and we get that thing so red hot
[1:21:10] until you could stick up you could stick
[1:21:12] a dry stick on the outside of it and it
[1:21:14] would start flaming that's how but they
[1:21:16] they heated that seven times hot so
[1:21:19] guess what in the seventh Church age
[1:21:20] seven times hotter it's going to be
[1:21:22] seven times hot on us but guess what
[1:21:24] when they throw us in the fire furnace
[1:21:25] it's gonna Deliver Us
[1:21:27] if you let it deliver you
[1:21:30] and lose them sometimes we're caught in
[1:21:32] that position first thing we've got just
[1:21:35] like the man drowning the river you got
[1:21:37] to get the man out of the river
[1:21:39] you got to get the man out of the river
[1:21:41] before you get the river out of him
[1:21:46] and that's sometimes what a man has to
[1:21:48] do is come out make it stand get the
[1:21:51] thing out hello church let it out
[1:21:55] and get him out of the things so he can
[1:21:57] get the thing out of him
[1:21:59] oh what a whoa let me read that one more
[1:22:02] time what did he do it never heard of me
[1:22:04] loosed them think of that situation how
[1:22:06] you turn that thing around
[1:22:10] job probably thought
[1:22:12] he was in bad shape
[1:22:16] he lost everything
[1:22:18] he had no kids
[1:22:20] he was like Bill Gates at one time now
[1:22:22] he's like wait now
[1:22:26] sitting on an ass sheet probably sitting
[1:22:28] on what his possessions that he used to
[1:22:31] have
[1:22:32] and there were ashes under his rear end
[1:22:35] and he got boils on his scraping the
[1:22:38] balls off of his skin turns around and
[1:22:40] looks and there's there's seven crosses
[1:22:42] out there in the field for his kids that
[1:22:44] had died
[1:22:46] all his animals were gone
[1:22:51] they had repossessed his car
[1:22:55] but he was in the will of God from the
[1:22:57] beginning
[1:22:59] because he took it and he stood up one
[1:23:00] day and he said I know
[1:23:02] from all this
[1:23:04] there's something good got to come my
[1:23:06] redeemer is going to have to come and
[1:23:08] bring me out of this
[1:23:14] he had when he started
[1:23:15] everybody with me had twice
[1:23:18] what he had when he started now you and
[1:23:20] I need to do the same thing when we go
[1:23:22] through a trial when we get through that
[1:23:24] trial and it loses you you ought to be
[1:23:27] twice as happy
[1:23:29] you ought to be twice as able to praise
[1:23:31] God twice as able to testify
[1:23:34] sister Freda blast is able to do things
[1:23:37] like that
[1:23:38] and that's sometimes what a man has to
[1:23:40] do is come and make it stand get the
[1:23:42] thing out get him out of the thing so
[1:23:44] the get the thing out of him
[1:23:47] that's what preaching will do for you
[1:23:52] now watch
[1:23:54] we'll read this and then we'll stop
[1:23:55] right here
[1:23:56] we'll get the rest of it Sunday
[1:23:58] if children than heirs Heirs of God and
[1:24:00] Joint heirs with Christ there so be that
[1:24:02] we suffer with him that we may be also
[1:24:04] glorified together for I reckon that the
[1:24:06] suffering of this present time is not
[1:24:08] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:24:09] which shall be what revealed in US
[1:24:15] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:24:17] reign with him
[1:24:19] you have to suffer to reign
[1:24:22] job had to suffer
[1:24:24] to reign Jesus Christ had to suffer
[1:24:30] to reign
[1:24:32] everybody all the Old Testament prop
[1:24:34] Moses
[1:24:36] Moses had to suffer
[1:24:38] to reign
[1:24:40] you say David was one of the greatest
[1:24:41] Kings yeah but he suffered
[1:24:44] remember he had the affair with
[1:24:46] Bathsheba had his best friend killed and
[1:24:48] God said that baby's not going to live
[1:24:50] because of what you did
[1:24:51] so God said your first child's not going
[1:24:53] to live
[1:24:54] he carried that with him the whole time
[1:24:58] the whole time he carried that with him
[1:25:00] all down through the time there's been a
[1:25:03] flaw I think brother Dale preached that
[1:25:05] one time years ago about all the flaws
[1:25:07] of the people in the new test Old
[1:25:09] Testament and New Testament Paul
[1:25:11] listen Paul took a church like this
[1:25:13] right here and put him in prison
[1:25:17] and made them blasphemed so they would
[1:25:19] go and be hung or be killed by lions or
[1:25:21] whatever they were doing back then he
[1:25:24] caused that
[1:25:25] he said causing them to blaspheme don't
[1:25:28] you think I stuck in his crawl the whole
[1:25:30] time
[1:25:31] but he took God to knock him off of a
[1:25:33] horse
[1:25:34] blind his eyes so he couldn't see
[1:25:37] give him a little light Affliction in
[1:25:39] his whole life to where he could
[1:25:41] remember what he had done
[1:25:44] remember he asked the Lord to take it
[1:25:46] away and the Lord said my grace is
[1:25:48] sufficient you're not going to die
[1:25:50] not with that they're going to cut your
[1:25:52] head off one day but you're not gonna
[1:25:53] die with whatever that was
[1:25:55] same way with the different ones same
[1:25:57] way with me and you
[1:25:58] you have to suffer to rain let's stand
[1:26:00] to our feet the reason for this is that
[1:26:02] character simply is never made without
[1:26:05] suffering
[1:26:06] character is a victory not a gift
[1:26:10] listen a victory
[1:26:12] not a gift
[1:26:14] see there's Gifts of healings there's
[1:26:15] gift of wisdom there's gift of faith
[1:26:17] there's gift of speaking in tongues it's
[1:26:19] not talking about that
[1:26:21] talk about your character
[1:26:23] because remember like I said before you
[1:26:24] speak in tongues and be a devil
[1:26:27] amen but you can't have the character of
[1:26:30] Jesus Christ and it be a victory and be
[1:26:31] the devil I promise you that not a gift
[1:26:34] a man without character can't reign
[1:26:37] you say well rain what do you mean rain
[1:26:39] listen you gotta Reign Over Yourself
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:43] who's your worst enemy your neighbor oh
[1:26:46] who
[1:26:47] a oh this guy yeah you ain't kidding
[1:26:49] y'all all point up this way
[1:26:53] a man without character can't Reign what
[1:26:56] rain over his own
[1:26:59] position
[1:27:02] because power
[1:27:04] apart from character listen there's
[1:27:05] power in these in these virtues
[1:27:08] there's holy ghost power in these
[1:27:10] virtues and he's not going to give them
[1:27:11] to you if you're still a baby
[1:27:14] because you'll use them wrong
[1:27:18] power apart from character is satanic
[1:27:21] musicians come but Power with character
[1:27:25] is fit to rule rule what rule over every
[1:27:28] situation in your life
[1:27:29] I told you before the Holy Ghost does
[1:27:31] not take away your problems it helps you
[1:27:34] deal with them it helps you do what show
[1:27:37] that it loses you instead of binds you
[1:27:39] we think our problems bind us no if
[1:27:42] you'll take it right your problems lose
[1:27:44] you
[1:27:46] put me in the furnace Lord
[1:27:48] if I'm bound something if something's
[1:27:50] binding me
[1:27:52] put me in the furnace and remember when
[1:27:55] they walked out of that though
[1:27:58] they didn't even smell like smoke
[1:28:02] God was so clean to you folks if you'll
[1:28:05] let him go to clean you so much he'll
[1:28:07] clean the very clothes you got on if you
[1:28:09] got on clean clothes and I ain't talking
[1:28:10] about clean worldly clean I'm talking
[1:28:12] about dress the way you're supposed to
[1:28:14] act the way we're supposed to you clothe
[1:28:17] yourself the right way then God is
[1:28:19] obligated to start on you with your
[1:28:21] character
[1:28:22] but Power with characters fit to rule
[1:28:25] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:28:27] throne on the same look on the same
[1:28:29] basis that he overcame and has sat down
[1:28:31] in his father's Throne then we have to
[1:28:33] overcome to sit with him the little
[1:28:35] temporary sufferings we go through now
[1:28:37] is not worthy to be compared to the
[1:28:40] tremendous Glory that we will be
[1:28:42] revealed in us when he comes oh what
[1:28:45] Treasures are laid up for those who are
[1:28:46] willing to enter into his kingdom
[1:28:48] through much
[1:28:49] tribulation
[1:28:51] what does tribulation work patience
[1:28:55] we'll read that when we get up to there
[1:28:56] to patients but think on these things
[1:28:58] think about God
[1:29:01] coming on Earth
[1:29:03] in a body of Flesh
[1:29:07] he walked through life
[1:29:09] and he was Mr Perfect
[1:29:11] but the world didn't call him that
[1:29:13] the world called him belzebub
[1:29:16] you know why because he was so far off
[1:29:18] of their Doctrine
[1:29:21] of what they thought the Messiah was
[1:29:24] going to be
[1:29:25] come on people
[1:29:27] they read the same quotes over and over
[1:29:29] and over Moses said up at this one and
[1:29:31] so did Zachariah brother Brown said he
[1:29:34] never came in he came the same way the
[1:29:35] word told him and they could read and
[1:29:37] read it and read it and read it that one
[1:29:39] was going to come virgin born and one
[1:29:40] was going to come to do this one was
[1:29:42] going to come to that what did they do
[1:29:44] they took the word that they had and
[1:29:45] misinterpreted it that's what our
[1:29:48] problem is misinterpreted theology is
[1:29:51] what got us in the shape we're in now
[1:29:53] not even not say us but yeah us we have
[1:29:56] little things little foxes that spoil
[1:29:58] the mind
[1:29:59] Little Things
[1:30:01] that we get upset about or or we can't
[1:30:04] don't handle them we have to what do it
[1:30:05] over listen you know what you do
[1:30:07] you know what you're doing you're
[1:30:09] actually tying yourself back up
[1:30:13] and you got to go back in that furnace
[1:30:15] again
[1:30:17] hey man
[1:30:18] come on somebody you tie yourself back
[1:30:21] up and you go one more time
[1:30:24] right
[1:30:25] let's burn those things off and get them
[1:30:27] out of our life
[1:30:29] creating me a clean heart let's think
[1:30:31] whatever you got let's say God bless you
[1:30:33] we love you with love of the Lord
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:38] there are people almost everywhere whose
[1:30:42] hearts are all a flame when the finally
[1:30:45] fell at Pentecost that Clinton made them
[1:30:48] clean it is burning now within my heart
[1:30:52] glory to his name I'm so glad

[1:31:20] them though these people may not learn
[1:31:24] to be nor boast on worldly thing they
[1:31:28] have all received
[1:31:29] Pentecost because we're going that
[1:31:32] statue of perfect man and folks this
[1:31:33] might be the last time we get up it that
[1:31:36] we're going to be able to teach it that
[1:31:38] was a day when God shut the ark and said
[1:31:40] nobody else is going in nobody else is
[1:31:42] getting out one of them you read the
[1:31:45] anointing ones at the end time
[1:31:49] you're gonna preach to the totally lost
[1:31:52] and there's nothing you can do about it
[1:31:54] and nothing they can do about it one of
[1:31:58] them
[1:31:59] I'm so glad that I can't say I'm one of

[1:32:08] room all praying in his name they were
[1:32:11] baptized with the Holy Ghost what
[1:32:14] powerful service came now what he did
[1:32:18] for them that day he'll do for you
