========================================

recording everybody see him yes sir good morning good morning so let's read free from verse one if everything do it and seeing the most juicy went up into a mountain and when he was said his disciples came into him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in the spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven this is the Kingdom of Heaven because they realize there's no righteousness in themselves and they start hungering and searching for for uh righteousness that only God can give well listen to that mourn for they should be comforted right by the comforter blessed are the meat fellatio inherent the Earth they inherit the Earth because they realize that uh the prophet that was sent for their age or the uh the ministers have something that um will at the end we'll read a little story about somebody who realized that they needed somebody else to teach them and they realized that um they begin by through meekness they hear the word blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and by being filled they begin to feel God's word and then we get to blister the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy when God's word begins to be fulfilled in you then you begin to exhibit these characteristics of the righteous and the first that's listed in the Beatitudes is merciful now um don't think that all the first four Beatitudes are not characteristics of someone that's also feel because through all through your journey you you continue to have it well poor be poor in spirit mourn for the condition of yourself the war the war with the Flesh and the um to continue to pray for your family and the people around you that aren't living right and you continue to be me studying the word and then we get to righteousness where God gives you power and you become merciful and so let's if you if you can kind of look at these they're kind of grouped in in pairs and uh that helps us understand because if you don't understand what one is you kind of look at the other and it kind of helps you pour in spirit if you're poor in spirit you begin to mourn meekness meekness means you begin to realize that the these ministers that the people that have the rights is just being revealed can uh reveal to you God's word and you uh open up the message but open up um put the tape in the tape player and press play and you begin his to hunger and thirst after righteousness and his word begins to be revealed in you now when his word is revealed and then you've got power and you can be merciful and pure in heart if you if your pure in heart the promise is that you will see God peacemakers and and persecuted so um we'll get into these a little bit more detail but the thing is you can't I mentioned last time that to be truly reversible you've got to be filled with the Holy Ghost because to be merciful you first must be in a position of power right because the homeless people that I come in contact with on the street in Atlanta they're not in a position of power to be merciful to me but I am to them I can when they I have one come up to me and say will you buy me something to eat and I said you come on through and you can buy whatever you want fill it up fill up your plate whatever you want and that's that's our approach to um once you're in a position with power then you could be merciful to the others to call them into a relationship with Christ just like we have that's what real Mercy is remember calling people into a relationship with God right let's review what righteousness is it's moving from righteousness to righteousness to Mercy it's a hard word to say this morning let him brother Graham was talking about him I think it's Revelations 22 where uh said let him this holy be holy steal to him this righteous be rise of Steel the righteous word of God the Son of God May manifest or that when when the when the um the spirit of God is lifted from the earth and the bride goes up let him this righteous be righteous still and what righteousness is is the Son of God they manifest the word being mean manifest in you and so to be righteous righteousness gives you power to be merciful blessed are the merciful for they should obtain mercy so there's a natural there's a natural uh way of looking at this is that if you um like on my jaw I'm merciful to the people that are under me and that causes them to be merciful to me I work harder for me right uh if you're merciful to the people around you then that that causes them to see that you that you love them that you want the best for them and um so that's the natural is just be good to people but then there's also the spiritual be merciful to uh Mercy real Mercy is withholding from someone what they deserve and uh we all deserve judgment we all deserve God's judgments so a lot of times we come into situations where people uh maybe from us deserve our harsh words and um deserve us to unsheet our sword so to speak but um when you put your sword back in your sheet that's true uh that's Mercy right the wicked bar with them payth not again but the righteous show with mercy and give us that's what the righteous do it's an attribute of being righteous right and we looked last time at uh what The Mercy Seat is propitiation the word propitiation of Romans 325 and the word mercy seat in Hebrews 9 5 is the same word Mercy is the kind Elders Bible dictionary said Mercy is the kind of passionate treatment of an offender adversary prisoner and one's power someone in your power compassion where severity is expected or deserved Mercy is kindness or as strong as he said Mercy is kindness a good will toward the miserable and The Afflicted joint with a desire to help them oh men towards the men of God towards men the mercy of Christ whereby his return of judgment he will bless true Christians in eternal life we're looking for yeah and The Mercy Seat is the Holy Ghost wrote around said so last time we walked through the day of atonement and how the high priest went in through the um to offer sacrifice to offer the atonement the atonement the goat had been killed one of the pair that one was escaped out the other was the god that God's goat and uh the high priest took the blood of the offering went through the holy Place passed by the table of showbread where there was no seat there's no there's no place to sit there's no place to rest and all the Tabernacle walked into the opportunity police where the only seat was the only place of rest the only product provided place of rest is is under God's shed blood and the evidence that the offering had been paid was placed was sprinkled on the emergency The Mercy Seat is deleted it's important to remember that the mercy seat and the cherubimes are one piece they were made out of one the same solid gold piece that's right because the cherubim was down through this church ages or God God's life God's power made manifest in a church it's attached to The Mercy Seat which is a representative of the Holy Ghost and we talked about how in Investments the the Israelites looked into the art they removed the the um the covering they removed the covering and peered into the law and because of that they died God took their life so The Mercy Seat is God's covering now Mercy is not a lot of people look at oh for example Catholics look at Mercy This Promise of the merciful shall receive Mercy as as this is how you're saved but you're not saved because that you stand in the soup liner because you do good things to different people it's it's you're saved by God's by God um Mercy is not taking taking what you've done and throwing it out the window it's God paid the price who paid the price so all of your sins that were maybe look at it like written down they were all blotted out and that's what Mercy is God took care of the um of all your sin and the evidence is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that his righteousness will be made manifest in you and then when you have that when you have that when you ever see Mercy then you can demonstrate Mercy right Mercy is a trait of righteousness Psalm 37 we looked at that already that we could borrow it's going to pay if not again but the righteous show of mercy and give a second Corinthians 1 3 to 4 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of All Comfort who comforted us who Comfort us us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are any trouble in in any trouble by the Comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God and that's what Mercy is God the father of Mercy if we're like our father we'll we will also demonstrate what he is to others what he has demonstrated to us Luke 6 36 to 38 be therefore merciful is also your father as your father also is a merciful judge not we shall we not be judged it goes on to tell us how to be merciful condemn not give and it shall be given unto you you can measure press down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet whether it shall be measured to you again thank you and numbers 14 this is Moses being merciful to the children of Israel now our deceased still let the power of my Lord be created for these out spoken with the Lord is long-suffering and of great Mercy for giving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children under the third and fourth generation far number 60 the iniquity of this people according into the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven his people from Egypt even until now even though Moses didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had a relationship with God he knew what kind of person God was that he was long-suffering of great mercy and he called that God remembers the type of person that he knew God were and pleaded with him to show them mercy and Deuteronomy 4 31 for the Lord thy God is a merciful god he will not forsake thee and neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy father in which he swear on them this is such great promises when you when you uh when you get on your knees and you need God to remember you uh remind God of his promises I know that thou art a merciful god he will not forsake me well Psalm 86 5 for the hour Lord aren't good and ready to forgive and plenteous and mercy unto all in that call upon me in Genesis 14 remember lot and Abraham's people had argued over got that little argument over the well and then uh they Abraham said a lot you go ahead and go off in whatever Direction you want in any direction and then a lot got kidnapped by Tim Leonard and Abraham and his Mercy went to lot and delivered him now the only way Abraham could show Mercy the lot was first he had to have power if he'd only have had uh maybe one or two little men to that uh in his in his army but um God put Abraham in a position that he could show Mercy a lot and go deliver everybody Joseph was in a position of power to forgive the Brethren that had treated him wrongly Moses cried after um when uh remember Miriam and Aaron came to Moses and said are you the only one that God talks to and then Moses showed them mercy of God on his knees and cried on the Lord saying heal her now oh God I deceased him now that's Mercy if you don't know what Mercy is yeah David was merciful to Saul's life when God put gave David power over Saul and put David in the cave with him and he cut off the Garment the bottom of Saul's uh that road um and then he felt bad about it later because Saul was God's anointed but all of these people were in power to give Mercy you got first to give Mercy you must have power in James 3 13-18 who is a wise man and then you with knowledge him when you let him show out of a good conversation his worst with the meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter ending and strife in your hearts Glory not and lying not against the truth the wisdom this wisdom descendeth not from above with an Earthly sensual devilish to where envying a Strife is taking your sword out of your sheath because you disagree me with me I'm going to cut you down by the words of my mouth for where envying astrology is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable remember the next beatitude is the pure of heart then Peaceable General and easy to be intrigued and full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sold in peace of them that make peace I believe seeing this is just something I put here I believe seeing a mercy looks beyond sin people shortcoming these offenses and injuries and it looks to what I believe one day if if they are a sinner but one day I want to draw them to be like me to see the same things that I do that's what Mercy is Psalm 18 25 to 26 with the merciful and thou will show thyself merciful right if you're merciful to others then God will be merciful to you that's right but this is not speaking about salvation Salvation is not based on your works right it's not based on standing in the soup kitchen line or giving food to the homeless and things like that with an upright man that will show thyself upright with him now to finish up I'm going a little bit faster here unexpected let's turn that actually this is let's take let's take our time with this because this has some good stuff I'm gonna look at it I feel like you can show someone Mercy and I want to read the start at verse one because we talked about how first year I must have power to show mercy and we'll read about somebody who's only Power and he told you to get power a different way than through God's providing way through justification sanctification the bad baptism of the Holy Ghost and a lot of people think power is uh powers like how Simon the Sorcerer thought it was but God gives us power to overcome the flesh to live a Godly life you know real power can be demonstrated in just a little man carrying his lunch box to work or a wife in the kitchen frame that's real righteousness make on this play let's look at Acts chapter 8. verse 1. see actually let's let's look at verse 30 verse 4. therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word then Philip went down to the city of primary and preached Christ under them and the people with the one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip's fake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of me that were present with them and many were taken and many taken with policies and that were laying were healed and there was great joy in that City but there was a certain man of Simon which Before Time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of Samaria giving out that himself was some great one and you can see today people doing the exact same thing saying I am the one that brother Reynolds spoke of that's to come and I'm the one that you need to listen to Irene said Justin Martyr wrote that after this story Simon went on to associate himself with this woman named Helen that uh according to irenius it took under uh she she valued the Treasures of the life more than the treasures above and Simon when it went around telling everybody that he was the son in one city and another city he was the father and that he was the one to manifest what the scriptures were open to make himself some big somebody because what he was really after was was power over people right verse 10 to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God and to him they had regard because that of a long time he had Bewitched them with sorceries for when they believe Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both the men and women they thought Simon had power when they heard Philip they knew he had power from God the assignment himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with Philip and wondering by holding the Miracles and signs that were done that when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down praying for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost of course it he was following up on none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus then they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and when Simon saw it through laying home laying on with the apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he offered them money you can't buy this kind of power when you're right you got to become God provided away from the street three steps justification sanctification and Simon didn't even have uh he didn't have crude meekness I need to listen to what these these people I can see the power of God in their life let me hear what they have to say and if it lines up with what the Bible says with what God's word says we all know that they're true seeing give me also this power that only whosoever I lay hands you may receive the Holy Ghost that Peter said unto him money perished with me because thou has thought that the gift of God made me purchased for money there was neither partner a lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God depend therefore this is like witness and pray God perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven me bureaucracy endowed in the gall bitterness and in the bond of iniquity then answered Simon and said pray he to the Lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me and they when they have testified and preached the word of the Lord returned to Jerusalem and preach the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans now I wanted to read that because he wanted power but he wanted a different kind of power he wanted power without character right now we'll get to somebody that has power and and we'll continue reading and they showed their power about being merciful right and the angel of the Lord speak under Philip saying arise and go toward the South unto the way and goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza which is Desert and you can see Gaza on the map right there down at the bottom and he arose and went and behold the man of Ethiopia and Munich of great authorities under Canada's Queen of the Ethiopians who had the charge of all of her treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship he was obviously in Jerusalem about the Passover time to celebrate Passover and he had he was in charge of all her treasure but he knew that the treasures of this Earth were uh would pass away and he was he was I believe at this point he was poor in spirit and he was mourning for his condition he had been in the Passover and realized that something something greater was out there for him to to find he said he was returning and sitting in his chair and he read Isaias the prophet then the spirit said unto go near and join myself to this Chariot and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understand this thou what thou raised and he said how can I here's meekness now that's right how can I accept some man should guide me and he desired to fill up that he would come up and sit with him place of the scripture which he read right and God was just setting everything perfectly up he just laid it in Phillip's lap here's what you're going to talk about the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his Shearer so opened he not his mouth and his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the Earth now that's such a beautiful place to start a discussing with somebody because who shall declare his generation his life was cut off but now I feel it was going to show him how he was going to declare the Life of Christ didn't have anybody in the natural to declare his life now he's going to declare it through you and I through this unit you know the eunuch is kind of in the same place in the Latin natural place he had no way to reproduce this season but he was going to get he was going to get birth into him right the seed of God from above and the unit cancer Philippa said I prayed the of whom the Prophet this of himself or of some other man and Philip opened his mouth and began in the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus and he was showing him Mercy because he asked for immersing his it was in Philip's power right to show the same Grace of Salvation right to this unit and as they came as they went on their way they came into a certain water and the eunuch said senior Year's water what does hinder me to be baptized and Philip said if thou Believers with all thine heart thou missed and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and so the unit was started on this way to righteousness and um and just finish on this June chapter 1 21-24 keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and assume have compassion like Philip making a difference and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh because if you have power then you can show compassion and pull others out of the fire to get them started on the road with the righteousness so that's what Mercy is let's stop right there
