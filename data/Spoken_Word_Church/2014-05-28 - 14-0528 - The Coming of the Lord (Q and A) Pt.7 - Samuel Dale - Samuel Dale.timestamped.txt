[4:20] and we'll try to get into that tonight
[4:22] if we can

[4:25] talk about the things we've been
[4:27] been dealing with first john
[4:30] 2 verse 26
[4:34] these things have i written unto you
[4:35] concerning them that seduce you
[4:38] but the anointing which ye
[4:40] have received of him abideth in you and
[4:42] you need not that any man teach you
[4:45] but it's the same anointing teaches you
[4:47] of all things and his truth and there's
[4:50] no lie
[4:51] and even as it have taught you
[4:54] you shall abide in him
[4:56] now little children abide in him that
[4:59] when he shall appear
[5:01] we
[5:02] may have confidence
[5:04] and not be ashamed before him
[5:07] at his coming you may be seated the lord
[5:10] at his blessing to the reading of the
[5:12] word
[5:13] yeah
[5:15] now when i get down to it we're going to
[5:16] do a lot of reading in just a minute
[5:18] and all because you know i make a lot of
[5:21] statements and i want you to have these
[5:23] so
[5:24] i decided to just run off the
[5:26] the quotes
[5:28] uh you know tonight
[5:29] and they're on the internet part so they
[5:32] will be able to
[5:33] see what we're talking about
[5:36] now we've been
[5:37] for about
[5:39] let's make seven services talking about
[5:42] the coming of the lord
[5:45] and
[5:47] we know that
[5:50] the coming of the lord is not like we
[5:53] think it is
[5:54] we had it figured out as being a shout
[5:56] and a voice of trumpet and
[5:59] the things and all the to do and the
[6:01] horns blowing and everything we found
[6:03] out that wasn't right
[6:05] and we found out about his coming is
[6:08] how did he come first to redeem his
[6:10] bride
[6:12] then he comes to catch away his bride
[6:16] and then he comes with his bride in the
[6:18] millennium all right then we know that
[6:22] the point we've went through the the
[6:24] first advantage the prophet said has
[6:26] three advents to his coming
[6:28] that that's already taken place
[6:31] in the basis that he came to redeem the
[6:34] bride now we're not talking about the
[6:36] coming of the lord just say to israel
[6:40] to this that we're only talking about
[6:42] the coming of the lord
[6:44] to are in involved in the bride of jesus
[6:48] christ because that's our part it's not
[6:51] nothing about israel to do with us you
[6:54] know now i know they receive this same
[6:56] message etc and we we believe that but
[6:59] we're just talking about the coming of
[7:00] the lord to the bride
[7:03] all right and we know that he's already
[7:05] come to redeem paid the price
[7:09] and and it's like i was trying to show
[7:10] you
[7:11] i believe that today you receive the new
[7:14] birth
[7:15] that that starts the part we would call
[7:18] the second coming of jesus christ or the
[7:22] part to where that it would be that he
[7:24] would come to catch us away because he's
[7:27] not going to catch everybody away
[7:29] at this part it's not going to be an end
[7:31] to the world it's not going to be you
[7:33] know a group thing it's going to be
[7:36] a little bride of christ that has made
[7:38] herself ready and you can only do that
[7:41] by first receiving the new birth so
[7:44] actually when you receive the new birth
[7:46] that started his coming right there to
[7:48] you
[7:49] as an individual you know in that new
[7:52] birth
[7:53] all right because that's the part we're
[7:54] concerned with we ought we believe the
[7:56] part where he died for our sins
[7:59] we believe the part where that we're
[8:01] going to come back with him
[8:03] in the millennial reign
[8:05] and all but that those are are not
[8:08] uh to say they're not worthy
[8:11] but they're not
[8:12] present tense i've been thinking about
[8:14] something on that because that's in my
[8:17] my thinking
[8:18] of you know maybe we'll speak on it some
[8:22] uh we're talking about something taking
[8:24] place now
[8:26] not talking about what was
[8:28] or taking or taking you know talking
[8:30] about what will be because wasn't that
[8:33] the way the prophet said it he said
[8:34] that's the way we do he said but we miss
[8:37] what's going on now
[8:40] our part our our doings all right but
[8:44] remember now
[8:46] the reason i connected
[8:48] connected or
[8:49] tie into the new birth is because i
[8:53] believe the new birth is a revelation
[8:56] all right it's a revelation of jesus
[8:57] christ personally to you
[8:59] coming to live in you
[9:01] and in being that then that is a
[9:04] fulfillment of
[9:06] the part that he has come we know for a
[9:09] certainty
[9:10] that he has already come you know to
[9:13] redeem why because we are experiencing
[9:17] the part of that in our own lives in our
[9:20] own redemption all right
[9:22] and see then in doing that we're we're
[9:25] not looking pious not looking future
[9:28] looking to present tense and seeing that
[9:31] what we're talking about must be
[9:33] revealed
[9:35] remember
[9:36] rapture is revelation but then what the
[9:38] prophet say
[9:40] he said the bride would be waiting for
[9:42] the revelation of the rapture
[9:44] all right then there's something about
[9:46] it that
[9:47] you know has to be and the rapture is
[9:49] only for who
[9:51] the royal seed of abraham it's only for
[9:55] those with the new birth
[9:57] because nobody else will be concerned in
[9:58] it and it'll be all the way down through
[10:01] time of all of those who has received
[10:04] the new birth
[10:05] and there are now souls under the altar
[10:09] crying how long you know
[10:11] waiting on you and i to come to a place
[10:15] to understand what's going on all right
[10:18] and see then that's what i've pointed at
[10:20] for 40 something years that i've tried
[10:23] to get you to look at
[10:25] is to see what's going on
[10:28] not what will be not what has been but
[10:31] what's going on now
[10:34] and and
[10:35] in the bible nobody ever amounted to
[10:37] anything
[10:38] until that was made known to them of god
[10:42] right then
[10:44] moses at the burning bush
[10:47] no good about mama he run
[10:50] you know in her revelation that was fine
[10:52] but he didn't have a revelation but one
[10:54] day he got a revelation he heads to
[10:56] egypt
[10:58] a lot of difference all right see then
[11:00] in that it must be revealed to us what
[11:03] we're talking about
[11:04] not just be able to quote it
[11:07] right there's a lot of people today say
[11:10] we know jesus christ died for our sins
[11:16] but does that save them
[11:20] why not
[11:23] because it's not revealed to them
[11:26] but yet they have knowledge of it
[11:29] yet they can quote and say things
[11:32] you know
[11:33] and live a good life and walk and all
[11:36] and do it
[11:37] but yet if it's not a revelation right
[11:40] amen all right see now this message must
[11:43] be revealed to us not just quoting it
[11:45] not just carrying it not just reading it
[11:50] no more than it was when we carried the
[11:52] bible
[11:54] and had a trinity in her hands
[11:58] no we didn't yeah you did you had a
[12:00] bible in your hands that you thought
[12:02] taught a trinity
[12:03] right
[12:05] but you see my point is right
[12:08] now
[12:09] we talked about tying together the
[12:12] coming of the lord
[12:15] and seeing what
[12:17] was already taken place
[12:20] and seeing where we're at in the point
[12:22] of
[12:23] the second advent or point of catching
[12:25] away
[12:27] and then we started talking about the
[12:29] rapture that the lord himself shall
[12:31] descend from heaven with a shout
[12:35] all right
[12:36] but you know that's not a
[12:38] that's not a shout from god unless it's
[12:40] revealed
[12:43] the voice of the seventh angel
[12:46] spoke the words fine
[12:48] but if it's not revealed what he said
[12:52] what good is it
[12:54] but see people will fight you over well
[12:56] the prophet had the revelation well amen
[13:00] but has it been revealed to you and i it
[13:02] don't have to be revealed to me just
[13:03] reveal to him well then he's the only
[13:05] one going
[13:09] right
[13:10] right
[13:11] i mean if that's the way it is he's the
[13:12] only one going
[13:14] because the only one with the revelation
[13:16] all right
[13:17] and we went through those things over
[13:19] and over and over reading
[13:22] and i've tried to hold that one point to
[13:24] you
[13:26] the shout has already went forth
[13:29] it was the message
[13:32] that we have heard
[13:34] this message that we talk about
[13:38] that was delivered to us by a prophet i
[13:40] believe that was the descendant of god
[13:44] all right
[13:45] because we know that he doesn't set foot
[13:48] on earth
[13:49] in a physical body
[13:51] a corporal body you know
[13:54] but yet he becomes visible among us and
[13:56] raises the dead and we go in the rapture
[13:59] so that that's not a physical part
[14:04] but it's a spiritual revelation amen now
[14:08] the other day then we ended up talking
[14:09] about it what is it what is the coming
[14:11] of the lord whatever stage you put it in
[14:13] stage one to redeem stage two to catch
[14:16] away stage three uh with him coming back
[14:20] whatever it is it's a revealed word
[14:24] what else could it be
[14:26] what are you looking for in the coming
[14:28] of the lord
[14:30] oh we don't believe it now about that
[14:33] hi to the trades you know we don't
[14:35] believe them things anymore but what do
[14:37] you believe
[14:39] you just moved up a step
[14:45] and you just put it all in the prophet
[14:50] and nothing for us
[14:52] come on
[14:53] like one man quoted one time he said the
[14:55] way we say it is all god was he put into
[14:57] christ and all christ was he poured into
[15:00] brother branham he died and took it with
[15:02] him
[15:04] you know and that's the way people i
[15:06] mean there's statements
[15:08] but remember
[15:09] we're talking about
[15:13] the revelation of jesus christ
[15:17] personally to you
[15:19] that starts in that new birth
[15:22] at faith
[15:23] in the growth development up the statue
[15:25] of a perfect man to come out to the
[15:27] headstone
[15:29] and i'm not looking somewhere else for a
[15:31] headstone
[15:32] come on
[15:34] i believe this message amen
[15:38] is a shout out i believe this message
[15:43] when you fully understand it is the
[15:45] headstone to the church
[15:48] but it must be revealed
[15:51] not just talk about it
[15:55] it must be revealed and to be revealed
[15:57] it means it's something personal to you
[16:00] as i illustrate martin luther
[16:03] preached many times about it but one day
[16:05] it come off the pages of that book into
[16:07] that man's heart
[16:09] well when it comes off the pages of this
[16:11] bible and these quotes that we have the
[16:14] prophet's message into our heart have
[16:16] something personal to you and i
[16:20] right then you ain't got to worry about
[16:22] a thing
[16:25] brother dale you preach hard and honest
[16:26] you're afraid you run people off you
[16:28] can't run people off it's got the holy
[16:29] ghost
[16:31] amen that's right
[16:34] well
[16:36] is it true
[16:39] i mean
[16:42] that's right come on
[16:45] i thought there was just one holy ghost
[16:48] i thought there was just one revelation
[16:51] i thought there was just one bible
[16:53] i didn't know it had so many avenues to
[16:55] it that everybody can take their own and
[16:57] run what they want to
[16:59] i thought it was to make one beautiful
[17:01] picture
[17:02] of the revelation of jesus christ
[17:05] personally to you
[17:08] and he's the head of the body the
[17:10] scripture says
[17:12] he who the revealed
[17:16] word the revealed word
[17:20] but now watch
[17:22] see then if he does not become visible i
[17:25] mean physical among us
[17:27] you know in that basis but he will
[17:29] become visible among us and raise the
[17:31] dead and we go in the rapture it must be
[17:34] a secret coming that we talked about
[17:38] that the world will know nothing about
[17:40] this coming yet they can talk about that
[17:42] coming
[17:43] they could prove he walked her on the
[17:45] shores of galilee they could prove he
[17:47] died
[17:49] and they can believe in a millennium to
[17:51] come
[17:52] but what about now amen
[17:58] what about now
[18:00] what about the hour that you and i are
[18:02] living
[18:06] see then i believe
[18:08] if that
[18:09] shout is the message
[18:13] it's revealing his coming
[18:17] are you following me
[18:20] the shout is the message the lord
[18:22] descends from heaven with a shout all
[18:24] right if he descends from heaven and
[18:25] shout that message is his coming amen
[18:29] the part to our day
[18:33] not to the jews not to somewhere else
[18:35] not the end of the world but you and i
[18:41] see then it's the revealing of the word
[18:46] and then
[18:47] we know that the voice of the archangel
[18:50] is the same one that lays raised lazarus
[18:55] right
[18:56] all right if it's the same one
[18:58] raised lazarus he would be here with us
[19:02] to raise the dead and we'll go in the
[19:04] rapture
[19:05] it's putting all the honor and glory on
[19:06] him not on you and i if we're anything
[19:09] whatsoever he made us
[19:14] it's not what we are it's what he is
[19:17] all right
[19:18] see the voice of the archangel then
[19:20] would be here on earth
[19:24] if the shout is here and the lord has
[19:26] come
[19:30] i meant to bring it i don't think i did
[19:32] in my jokes
[19:33] i found that quote we're brought around
[19:34] talking about
[19:35] it's going to be solids in heaven
[19:37] because ain't going to be nobody up
[19:38] there i'll bring it sunday i think i got
[19:40] it in my notes
[19:41] in here but
[19:44] but think about it now
[19:47] jesus does not put on or set foot on
[19:50] earth till the millennium
[19:52] but he'll be visible in the bride
[19:55] and will call the dead out of the ground
[19:57] i believe man
[19:59] all right
[20:01] now
[20:03] i want to read a whole lot because i
[20:05] know that i make a lot of statements and
[20:07] i put a lot of quotes in
[20:09] but i wanted to give you these
[20:11] where did you see why that all of these
[20:13] years
[20:14] why i believe what i've believed
[20:19] that i believe that
[20:22] the coming of the lord
[20:24] is the revealing of his word
[20:27] because we're not dealing with a
[20:28] physical part
[20:30] all right
[20:32] now and in being the coming of the lord
[20:35] then
[20:36] the bride
[20:40] would be the son of man
[20:44] the word
[20:45] made
[20:46] flesh
[20:48] is that who the son of man was
[20:52] is that john 1 14 and the word was made
[20:54] flesh and dwelt among us
[20:56] all right
[20:58] and to see it then
[21:01] that
[21:03] the bride
[21:06] will be because of what god makes her
[21:10] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[21:16] but you see people don't want to talk
[21:17] about that
[21:19] they want something another some hoopla
[21:21] some other form
[21:24] but what about you
[21:28] because remember the only way we can
[21:31] come become up this statue of a perfect
[21:34] man
[21:35] is through the opening of the word
[21:39] all right
[21:41] well no we just we just practice it we
[21:43] just do practice all you want to yeah
[21:47] and you'll get what the prophet said
[21:49] on
[21:50] stature of perfect man or blasphemius 9
[21:52] 1. he said a lot of people have a
[21:54] portion of these virtues and not even
[21:56] born again
[21:59] so just go ahead and practice you just
[22:00] get a portion of the virtues
[22:03] and that makes you a good neighbor
[22:06] but it don't make you a christian
[22:09] it's only when the word is revealed to
[22:11] you or you're a christian
[22:13] all right
[22:15] see then there's not anything to to be
[22:17] considered if the prophet said what we
[22:21] are
[22:23] is there anything wrong with us saying
[22:26] what we are that he said we are
[22:32] now there's a lot of doctrines around
[22:34] the message that a lot of people have
[22:36] said a lot of things about what we are
[22:38] you know what everybody boy they'd
[22:40] joyously run in and scream oh look at it
[22:43] look at it
[22:46] until you just get settled down
[22:49] and talk about the revealed word
[22:56] starting from the new birth
[22:59] going all the way up through the pyramid
[23:02] and comes out to be the headstone to the
[23:04] church
[23:05] and they'll have to be a headstone to
[23:06] the church before she can leave
[23:11] now in doing that then
[23:14] the church has always had a head
[23:17] christ with the head of his church in
[23:19] luther's age wesley's age pentecostal
[23:21] age
[23:22] but then that means there's something
[23:24] different
[23:25] about this age
[23:28] you remember the series right prior to
[23:30] this that we talked about the corner
[23:32] wheat that would die and fall into the
[23:33] ground
[23:34] and now that we talked about it being
[23:36] the bride of jesus christ
[23:38] would return to the original grain
[23:41] not if it wasn't grained down to the
[23:43] ages
[23:45] but to return to the original grain
[23:50] and the original grain we read then was
[23:52] the son of man
[23:58] but brother dale i can just listen to
[24:00] some of these others and i can just
[24:01] enjoy and i and i can see what they're
[24:03] talking about
[24:05] that's what
[24:07] one fellow is telling about said he was
[24:08] preaching
[24:09] or this man was preaching this lady said
[24:12] well i see what he saw he said my lord
[24:14] lady that ain't even in the bible
[24:17] what the man was preaching about but she
[24:19] could see it
[24:21] i can see that
[24:22] when a man told me one time here we're
[24:25] talking about something he said i can
[24:26] see that i said well i certainly can't
[24:28] code it ain't in the bible
[24:33] but see this
[24:35] i can see that
[24:37] i can see how they could be three but
[24:38] yet there's just one but i really don't
[24:40] know maybe there's two or four or six or
[24:44] oh i can see that
[24:47] well i can't
[24:51] i can see one
[24:53] and that's it
[24:55] but what about a prophet telling us what
[24:58] we are
[25:01] but yet it's hard for us to believe
[25:06] but he says we are
[25:13] you know that jesus told the church
[25:16] paraphrasing words putting it with the
[25:18] prophet
[25:21] that by him coming and living in us
[25:25] would make us the bride of christ
[25:29] and would make us
[25:31] just as perfect
[25:34] as he is
[25:41] now
[25:42] i don't ask for a raise of hands but
[25:45] because you might want to bow your head
[25:46] in the next statement
[25:48] but see a lot of people can quote that
[25:51] but has it been revealed to you
[25:56] has it been revealed to you that you're
[25:58] just as perfect as god is
[26:02] by being in jesus christ
[26:07] you see what i'm talking about
[26:13] see then the prophet would tell us a lot
[26:14] of things and
[26:19] about us
[26:22] but do we believe it
[26:25] that's why i just chose to give them to
[26:26] you just give you the the quotes
[26:30] and then if it's time for question and
[26:32] answer if not we'll take it up sunday
[26:33] you don't worry about it
[26:35] let's just read some things the prophet
[26:37] says
[26:38] about you
[26:42] and see if you can believe it
[26:45] very simple things that we've heard him
[26:47] make the statements
[26:50] but i hope you'll follow the reading the
[26:52] best i could lay it
[26:54] down to
[26:55] make it grow grow in growing growing
[26:58] growing
[26:59] go ahead brother
[27:01] anderson pull up number one
[27:04] the good
[27:04] shepherd
[27:06] priest in 1957 308
[27:09] and look what he says
[27:13] he's talking about jesus christ was the
[27:15] son of god he had the spirit without
[27:17] measure we believe that in him never
[27:20] dwelt just a part of god
[27:22] but
[27:23] all of god was in his son christ jesus
[27:27] he was the fullness of the godhead
[27:28] bodily
[27:30] all god was
[27:32] poured out in christ
[27:35] all that god was was in christ
[27:39] and all that christ is
[27:41] he poured out on the
[27:46] church no
[27:49] but you keep refusing it
[27:56] now what would be
[28:00] why would a prophet make that statement
[28:04] but you keep refusing it
[28:07] to refuse something is to turn it down
[28:09] right
[28:11] to reject it
[28:12] to not agree with it
[28:16] is that right
[28:19] why would he say the things that he said
[28:21] all the years but then put it in there
[28:23] and say that
[28:27] if you refuse it
[28:32] the things if i do not the works of my
[28:34] father believe me not
[28:36] and as the father has sent me
[28:39] how did the father send him the father
[28:41] sent him and went
[28:43] with him and in him
[28:45] so send i you
[28:47] he's sending the church in the same way
[28:49] that god sent him
[28:51] do we believe that
[28:56] the god that went
[28:59] that sent him went with him
[29:01] the christ that sends the church goes
[29:04] into church
[29:05] and the very same works
[29:08] do we believe it
[29:10] look at the next one
[29:13] e48
[29:16] having conferences
[29:18] okay you can go ahead and read that part
[29:19] because that's part of the quote
[29:24] look what he says go ahead and roll this
[29:27] part up
[29:29] the holy spirit that called him emmanuel
[29:36] god with us
[29:37] announced god in us the same spirit
[29:41] we receive it by portion
[29:43] measure
[29:44] he received it without portion or
[29:46] measure
[29:47] that's easy to understand
[29:49] none of us are god the fullness
[29:53] but just remember
[29:55] around the world put it all together and
[29:57] what have you got
[29:59] you've got his fullness
[30:01] right
[30:03] look he received it without portion of
[30:05] measure in him was the fullness of god
[30:08] all that god was he poured into christ
[30:10] and all christ was
[30:13] poured over the church amen
[30:16] that day you'll know that i'm in the
[30:18] father the father in me and i and you
[30:21] and you and me oh my when it comes that
[30:23] day
[30:24] now we're working on god got orders just
[30:27] keep moving
[30:28] so evidently
[30:31] at that day you'll know
[30:34] so it evidently means that
[30:37] you don't get it right off hand
[30:41] but that you move into it
[30:47] right
[30:49] see all god was how many times did
[30:51] brother brown say oh god was he poured
[30:53] into christ
[30:54] and all christ poured into the church
[30:58] now if he was the fullness of the
[31:00] godhead bodily and then you pour him
[31:02] into the church what does that make her
[31:07] we each want to have it as a portion
[31:09] right
[31:10] but all around the world it makes her
[31:13] the bride of christ the fullness of the
[31:15] goddess bodily is that sensible
[31:21] then we don't have to worry about trying
[31:22] to be something just be the portion that
[31:25] we are
[31:27] but remember the explanations and i'll
[31:29] be glad to get them for you
[31:31] of how he explains that
[31:33] he explains it like a drop of water or a
[31:35] teaspoonful out of the ocean
[31:38] right
[31:39] but remember his definition of that
[31:42] the same identical chemicals
[31:46] of the entire ocean
[31:48] is the same chemicals in the spoonful
[31:54] it's just according how it's measured
[31:55] out
[31:57] but do we believe it
[32:01] in a portion do we actually believe it
[32:05] do we believe the things that he has
[32:06] said about us
[32:09] go ahead to perseverance
[32:11] paragraph 13 31 1962.
[32:16] now god prepared himself a body in the
[32:18] form of the lord jesus which was the
[32:20] christ meaning the anointed one and now
[32:22] all that god was was in christ he was
[32:25] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[32:27] that's what the scripture says now and
[32:30] all that god was he poured out in christ
[32:33] he was emmanuel god with us and all that
[32:36] christ was he poured out into the church
[32:43] what is it anointed one to continue his
[32:46] work
[32:47] that his word might live
[32:51] constantly
[32:53] go ahead
[32:55] be not afraid 1962
[32:58] e-79
[33:02] now here is what it is
[33:04] i just got through saying god is in his
[33:06] people all that god was he poured into
[33:08] jesus do you believe that he was the
[33:10] fullness of the godhead bodily and all
[33:13] jesus was he poured into the church
[33:15] the holy ghost is that right
[33:17] so it's god in us god in you it's not it
[33:20] doesn't make you anything
[33:22] it's not the holy mountain or the holy
[33:25] church
[33:26] it's the holy ghost
[33:27] not the holy people the holy ghost
[33:30] it's the holy ghost in the people not
[33:33] holy people
[33:34] holy ghost
[33:37] is that simple
[33:42] go on to the next one
[33:44] a testimony upon the c62
[33:48] e88
[33:50] go ahead and roll it all the way so we
[33:51] got all
[33:52] down at the bottom
[33:55] all that god was he poured into christ
[33:58] he was the fullness of the godhead
[34:00] bodily
[34:01] and all that christ was he poured into
[34:04] his church that day you'll know that i'm
[34:06] in the father father and me knowing you
[34:08] it's god it was god above us god with us
[34:10] god in us see what i mean
[34:13] there it is the same god
[34:19] the prophet said outside of the corporal
[34:21] body being here
[34:25] he's here the same as he was when he
[34:27] walked ashore to galilee
[34:30] where's he at
[34:34] in his bride
[34:35] amen
[34:36] just keep reading christ is a mystery
[34:38] god revealed paragraph 1
[34:41] 59 16 to 162
[34:44] god expressed in jesus who was both
[34:46] father son and holy ghost the fullness
[34:48] of the godhead bodily
[34:50] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[34:52] bodily
[34:53] dwells in his church
[34:57] remember i said a while ago
[34:58] that's the way i put them down put down
[35:00] what you thought get your thought get
[35:02] your thought now lay it on you
[35:07] now the complete fullness of the godhead
[35:09] bodily dwells in his church
[35:14] the preeminences
[35:15] all that god was he poured into christ
[35:18] and all that christ was he poured into
[35:19] the church
[35:20] the believers
[35:23] so now he's saying
[35:26] the complete fullness of the godhead
[35:30] dwells in his church
[35:32] go ahead to the next one
[35:35] take him across the mystery of god
[35:36] reveal you remember it's in a threefold
[35:38] he's talking about the second fold of
[35:40] the threefold manifestation first to
[35:42] express himself in christ then express
[35:44] itself through the church
[35:46] and the same thing christ was the word
[35:48] and the church becomes the word when it
[35:50] lets the word
[35:52] go through them
[35:55] right
[35:59] roll it on up because we're going to go
[36:00] down to paragraph 380.
[36:03] and in there there would be a time come
[36:05] forth when he could express himself
[36:08] in
[36:09] fullness of his godhead
[36:12] deity through his church
[36:17] are you reading
[36:18] and there there would be a time come
[36:21] forth when he could express himself
[36:24] in fullness
[36:25] of his godhead deity through his church
[36:28] how the preeminence is in his church oh
[36:31] my what the anointed man now the
[36:34] anointed people oh my to bring back the
[36:36] anointed bride
[36:37] and the bridegroom
[36:39] what about it
[36:40] do we believe we're the fullness going
[36:42] to the next one
[36:43] the mighty god unveiled before us 1964
[36:46] 629 paragraph 130.
[36:49] it was god in christ god and man the
[36:52] fullness of the godhead bodily in a man
[36:54] god and a man and now it's god in men
[36:57] the fullness of god in the godhead
[36:59] bodily in his entire church manifesting
[37:03] himself fulfilling his word
[37:07] well i guess
[37:09] in a way you could say that remember the
[37:12] mule is the one that says that you know
[37:14] remember that
[37:18] well i just don't see it
[37:21] do you mean it's not true
[37:28] you you say i don't believe it that mean
[37:31] it's not true
[37:32] does it make it not true because you
[37:34] don't believe it
[37:42] you know what he don't even really need
[37:43] nobody to believe it to make it true
[37:47] right
[37:49] because it is true
[37:51] is what he said
[37:52] we want to believe what the prophet said
[37:54] about this that and the other but what
[37:55] about the rest of it
[37:57] what about lean not unto your own
[37:58] understanding 65 120 paragraph 17.
[38:04] the only way you can be a son of god or
[38:06] a daughter of god you had to be a part
[38:08] of god and god isn't complete without
[38:11] you
[38:14] he has to be that's right because
[38:15] there's one
[38:17] only one resource of eternal life and
[38:18] that's god and him alone has eternal
[38:20] life and you never were
[38:23] it and
[38:24] now and you were a part of him in so
[38:27] much you're an attribute or in his
[38:29] thinking in the beginning
[38:32] amen
[38:33] who is this melchizedek 65
[38:36] 221 paragraph 43
[38:40] read on it
[38:42] god and morphe mask in the pillar of
[38:44] fire
[38:44] god in morphy in a man called jesus
[38:47] god and morphy in his church
[38:50] god above us god with us god in us the
[38:52] condescending of god
[38:56] the coming
[38:57] the condescending the lowering down the
[38:59] coming
[39:02] do you see one that i believe these
[39:03] things
[39:04] because i can read what he says
[39:07] and he said it was there it was god
[39:09] above us god with us now it's god in us
[39:11] the holy spirit not the third person the
[39:14] same person
[39:17] all right
[39:18] how about the next one god's provided
[39:20] place of worship
[39:22] 65 425
[39:25] verb 91
[39:26] in him dwells the fullness of the
[39:28] godhead bodily
[39:30] were we in there are sons and daughters
[39:33] of god
[39:34] sons and daughters to god
[39:36] no you
[39:38] out there if you don't
[39:40] hear that i'm reading it the way if the
[39:41] book says it so
[39:43] if they missed it okay but
[39:46] that's what the book says were we in
[39:48] there our sons and daughters of
[39:50] daughters to god in god's
[39:53] godhead
[39:54] yes
[39:57] remember he's not complete without us
[40:01] it's what he chose us to be
[40:04] it's not what we've made ourselves
[40:08] it's what he's chosen us to be
[40:10] okay
[40:13] go ahead to the next one
[40:18] 264.
[40:22] god's only provided place of worship no
[40:24] leaven among you
[40:26] that brings the entire fullness of the
[40:28] godhead bodily among you
[40:32] do we believe it
[40:33] well
[40:35] i kind of hate way
[40:37] i believe it because he said it
[40:43] well the bible never did teach a trinity
[40:45] and you believed it
[40:48] and i did too
[40:52] so we may be believing a lot of things
[40:53] that will
[40:55] look what he says
[40:57] no leaven among you that brings the
[40:59] entire fullness of the godhead bodily
[41:00] among you couldn't do it in luther's age
[41:03] couldn't do it in west ham couldn't do
[41:04] it in pentecostal but in today when the
[41:07] son of man will be manifested
[41:10] and we're going to deal with son of man
[41:11] for a minute
[41:12] reveal brought back the church together
[41:15] with the entire deity of god amongst his
[41:18] people
[41:22] son of man coming into bride and is into
[41:24] our deity
[41:26] amongst his people showing the same
[41:28] visible signs manifesting himself like
[41:30] he did at the beginning when he was
[41:32] manifested on earth in the form of a
[41:34] prophet god all glory promised by
[41:36] malachi 4 promised by the rest of the
[41:39] scripture
[41:40] where you worship at the house of god
[41:42] seated in present tense
[41:45] on to the next
[41:47] modern events made clear by prophecy
[41:49] 65 1206
[41:54] burger 172
[41:57] you were here in christ because he was
[41:59] the fullness of the word
[42:01] he was the fullness of the godhead to a
[42:02] bodily god was in christ reconciling the
[42:05] world to himself do you believe that
[42:07] look he was in christ
[42:09] then if you were in god a gene a word
[42:12] attribute from the beginning then you
[42:14] walk with him here on earth you talked
[42:17] with him on earth you suffered with him
[42:19] on earth you died with him at calvary
[42:22] and you rose with him
[42:24] again
[42:27] and now you're seating sitting in
[42:29] heavenly places in christ jesus
[42:31] communing with him
[42:32] the word
[42:33] as it feeds unto your soul
[42:36] that man shall live by every word that
[42:39] proceedeth
[42:42] how much more could a prophet say
[42:45] than what we talk about
[42:48] go ahead to the next one
[42:53] we would see jesus 1962 627
[42:56] e71 now jesus now said what was that man
[43:00] who was he abraham ought to know abraham
[43:03] called him elohim is that right the
[43:05] self-existing god himself made flesh and
[43:07] showing that god in the light showing
[43:10] that god in the last days he said as it
[43:12] was in the days of lot so shall it be in
[43:14] the coming of the son of man that god
[43:16] himself in the form of the holy ghost
[43:19] would be so into his church
[43:22] so filled till he'd be moving and
[43:25] operating in the church
[43:28] god in human fleshy
[43:30] doing the same thing right
[43:32] can we believe that
[43:35] the unveiling of god 1964 614 paragraph
[43:38] 270.
[43:41] notice
[43:42] then we
[43:43] then we become part of him
[43:45] as you are the veil that veils him
[43:48] you're part of him
[43:49] as long as christ is in you
[43:51] as christ was in god was of god
[43:54] because god was in him
[43:57] made him god and as christ is in you the
[44:00] hope of glory you become part of christ
[44:03] he that believeth on me the works that i
[44:04] do shall he also see you become part of
[44:07] christ as long as christ is hidden in
[44:09] you
[44:10] then it's veiled to the unbeliever but
[44:13] you know he's in you
[44:15] you are templing christ that's behind
[44:17] the veil the skin then we be behind
[44:21] because of this veil the veil again in
[44:24] human flesh hides god the word from the
[44:28] unbeliever
[44:30] right
[44:30] so we're ahead there's no way to see it
[44:34] i realized in 1969
[44:36] when i preached the bride of jesus
[44:38] christ with the son of man there was
[44:40] nobody able to see what i was talking
[44:41] about if it wasn't revealed
[44:47] because how in the world could you talk
[44:48] about a people being the son of man
[44:53] the mighty god unveiled before us 1964
[44:58] 629 paragraph 120.
[45:02] he's talking about moses and jesus and
[45:05] the days no
[45:06] he was a living word to the people today
[45:09] jesus veiled is the living word to the
[45:11] people
[45:12] jesus in the church
[45:16] the holy ghost the son of god and the
[45:17] people revealing the word by the promise
[45:20] of this day makes it just exactly the
[45:22] same
[45:24] right what about it
[45:27] mighty god unveiled paragraph 147.
[45:32] and jesus said as it was in the days of
[45:34] sodom show silvia so shall it be at the
[45:36] coming of the son of man
[45:38] the deity veiled in human flesh
[45:42] now you know
[45:43] there's a lot of people
[45:44] believe that brother branham was deity
[45:47] veiled in human flesh
[45:53] as deity not just
[45:55] a part of the body of christ
[45:58] huh but now i don't believe that don't i
[46:02] believe
[46:03] that that new birth inside of him
[46:06] was deity but i believe the new birth
[46:08] inside of you is deity
[46:12] all right we'll go along with it like
[46:13] that see i believe in deity that way
[46:16] that every born-again believer
[46:19] is god in human flesh
[46:21] deity
[46:23] dwelling
[46:24] in human flesh
[46:26] i believe that
[46:28] so call me a deity that's what i believe
[46:31] but just remember
[46:33] you make brother random deity
[46:35] what did he say you do
[46:40] huh
[46:42] now remember jesus didn't say when the
[46:44] son of god is being revealed in luke the
[46:46] 17th
[46:47] chapter i believe in about the 20th 21st
[46:50] verse which is real 1730 somewhere along
[46:53] there he said and when the son of man is
[46:56] being revealed the son of man back in in
[47:00] in the church again
[47:03] revealed in human beings
[47:08] so it must not have been just brother
[47:10] branham right
[47:11] not son of god but the son of man again
[47:14] back in his church again in the last
[47:16] days we find that he promised that
[47:19] in god's promises
[47:22] all right
[47:22] look at the rapture
[47:24] paragraph 117.
[47:26] maybe i'm just talking another you'll
[47:28] get a lot of questions
[47:29] and we'll get to it
[47:32] now that's the age that we're living in
[47:34] right now the seventh church age that's
[47:36] all to be manifested in the grain of
[47:37] wheat at the end
[47:39] another comeback
[47:41] and once another comeback one for the
[47:43] son of man now if you take luke the 17th
[47:46] chapter and the 30th verse he said as it
[47:47] was in the days of sodom so shall it be
[47:49] in the coming of the son of man when the
[47:51] son of man begins to reveal himself
[47:54] what is revealed make his revelation of
[47:56] what he is in this day
[48:02] are you reading it
[48:03] make his revelation of what he is in
[48:06] this day
[48:08] revealed out to the people
[48:09] the word that's made known for the day
[48:12] revealed to the people by the
[48:14] manifestation of the holy spirit making
[48:16] that jesus living
[48:19] among us
[48:20] all right
[48:21] what's the next one restoration of the
[48:23] bride tree
[48:25] paragraph 541
[48:28] now you promised to do in the evening
[48:29] time you promised to do it in the last
[48:32] days
[48:33] he said and so shall it be in the coming
[48:34] of the son of man as it was in the days
[48:36] of light so will it be god living in
[48:39] human flesh
[48:40] among us
[48:42] in the form of his church
[48:49] in the only in the holy spirit
[48:52] performing the same sign
[48:55] in the form of this church
[48:58] yeah but
[48:59] i thought it was brother branham okay
[49:04] look at the next one
[49:08] sirs we would see jesus
[49:10] 1964 318 paragraph 161
[49:13] jesus was god in flesh and if jesus is
[49:16] in you tonight it's still god manifest
[49:19] himself in the last days the son of man
[49:22] revealing himself in his church
[49:27] in the human flesh making himself known
[49:29] you get it
[49:30] see god down here in his church making
[49:32] himself again the word the son of man
[49:35] being revealed in the last days as it
[49:37] was in the days of sodom
[49:39] see we believed that brother randall
[49:42] wrote that but he was not the son of man
[49:44] but the bride of jesus christ is the son
[49:46] of man
[49:48] all right
[49:50] and watch him on the message called the
[49:52] trial
[49:54] priest of 1964 427
[49:58] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[49:59] and forever and he's identified himself
[50:01] as he promised much more could we say
[50:04] in this last days as son of man making
[50:06] himself known among his people in the
[50:09] form of his people
[50:12] see not son of god not son of david but
[50:15] son of man the son of god was the
[50:16] supernatural
[50:18] i wrote it on up a little bit because 2
[50:20] 69.
[50:21] he said it was in the days of sodom so
[50:23] shall be in the coming of the son of god
[50:25] coming
[50:26] when the son of man shall be revealed a
[50:29] son of man being revealed not the son of
[50:30] god in the church age he's put out of
[50:33] that
[50:34] now he's son of man revealing himself
[50:36] the word is becoming flesh
[50:40] among us right
[50:42] look at the next one harvest time
[50:46] paragraph two or 354.
[50:49] in that day like
[50:50] luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said
[50:53] when the son of man is being revealed
[50:55] not man the son of man not an
[50:57] organization the son of man the word
[51:00] living itself again among
[51:02] the people
[51:04] the word itself made flesh in you
[51:06] you are a reflection of this hour the
[51:08] message the re reflection of it see
[51:13] you live again live the life that's in
[51:15] jesus christ you're in the presence of
[51:17] the son all right
[51:20] what is it
[51:24] 3 54.
[51:26] a couple more then we'll
[51:28] and we'll get down to your question
[51:30] majority why did i believe this
[51:36] i believe what he said
[51:39] the anointed ones in the end time
[51:41] paragraph
[51:43] 260.
[51:44] now watch him explain what he's talking
[51:46] about in the very day that the son of
[51:48] man is revealed revelations 10 1-7
[51:52] and we'll automatically put brother
[51:53] brown in there right
[51:55] read it when you get home the seventh
[51:57] angel's message opening up the seals
[51:59] what is it
[52:00] not the angel is the son of man
[52:04] but the messenger is revealing the son
[52:06] of man
[52:08] can you get it separated now that's
[52:10] where it seems to be so hard for you you
[52:12] see not the son of man himself but the
[52:14] seventh angel the seventh messenger is
[52:17] revealing to the public the son of man
[52:20] because it's left to shuck
[52:23] now what's after the shock the wheat
[52:24] right
[52:26] he can't organize it
[52:28] it's the grain itself
[52:31] all again
[52:36] look at the next one
[52:38] christ revealed in his own word
[52:39] paragraph 141
[52:41] then he was made actually human flesh
[52:43] and dwelt among us in the person of
[52:45] jesus christ himself born of the virgin
[52:47] mary he come in that form so he could
[52:50] die and went back into heaven now this
[52:52] last days he has promised to manifest
[52:54] himself in the fullness again
[52:57] of his flesh
[52:59] in spirit
[53:00] see
[53:01] for as it was in the days of sodom so
[53:03] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[53:05] man now look at this at sodom how it was
[53:08] set what taken place and jesus being
[53:11] manifested in bodily form of his church
[53:15] today
[53:18] see doing the same thing same work same
[53:20] things that he did all the time never
[53:21] changes eternal one the and upon earth
[53:25] today he has manifested itself in the
[53:27] human bodies
[53:29] our human bodies that he has called and
[53:32] done exactly the same thing
[53:34] he done in sundry times in the times of
[53:37] his flesh
[53:39] upon the earth
[53:42] all right
[53:43] let's see i've got one more
[53:46] let's go to the last one modern events
[53:48] make clear about prophecy
[53:52] paragraph 233
[53:54] they'll get you questions and things
[53:55] ready comments or whatever
[53:57] jesus when he come he was to be a
[53:59] prophet that's right and today before
[54:00] jesus comes again the full manifestation
[54:03] of manifestation of the person of jesus
[54:06] christ is to be manifested in flesh
[54:08] that was brother branham
[54:10] now you just got through saying he was
[54:12] not the son of man all right
[54:14] think of it jesus said as it was in the
[54:16] days of sodom so shall it be at the
[54:17] coming son of man when the son of man is
[54:19] being revealed what is revealed unfolded
[54:22] made known the secret had been brought
[54:24] forth revealed in the day that the son
[54:27] of man will be revealed the world will
[54:29] be in a sodom condition
[54:31] we've got it haven't we yeah
[54:33] how many believes that it's in a sodom
[54:36] condition
[54:37] and that's exactly right look where
[54:39] it's sitting now
[54:42] so what do you think
[54:49] i conclude and think that
[54:52] by god joining himself to his church
[54:56] that he's made us to be what he's always
[54:58] wanted us to be
[55:01] this last day people
[55:03] are going to manifest him in his
[55:06] fullness
[55:08] not in one person
[55:11] no
[55:12] in the bride around the world
[55:15] she will be the word made flesh
[55:18] she will be the fullness of the godhead
[55:20] bodily upon earth again
[55:23] the grain of wheat
[55:25] that went into the ground is to return
[55:27] again
[55:29] the son of man the lord jesus christ
[55:31] that stood back there come down here
[55:34] through the prophet and on out into his
[55:36] bride and remember the prophet is part
[55:39] of the body of christ
[55:44] he was not the son of man he was a son
[55:46] of man but the bride all put together is
[55:49] the son of man the lord jesus christ
[55:53] deity
[55:55] living in us
[55:57] you see why i believe it
[56:02] you see why after all of these years i
[56:04] still believe it
[56:07] and i believe he's wanting us to realize
[56:09] who we are
[56:12] and what he has done for this age
[56:16] we haven't made ourselves anytime
[56:21] but it's what he's made us
[56:25] you know what he's made us him
[56:28] manifest
[56:31] there's your
[56:32] voice of the archangel
[56:36] to call the dead
[56:38] where he would be visible among us raise
[56:41] the dead and we'll go in the rapture
[56:43] it's all in him it's not in you and i
[56:45] it's what he said what he said he would
[56:48] do and you know what whether or not we
[56:50] believe it or what he's going to do it
[56:54] because he said he was
[56:58] it's our choice to decide whether or not
[57:00] we believe it
[57:02] or keep walking around horeb for 40 more
[57:05] years
[57:06] and too late folks most of us ain't got
[57:09] 40 years
[57:12] if they did they'd have to put us in a
[57:14] wheelchair and roll us around with a
[57:17] ventilator system hooked to us
[57:19] you know
[57:20] for us to live
[57:25] but you know what
[57:27] somebody's going to believe
[57:30] yeah but i thought this was going to
[57:31] happen i thought that was going to
[57:32] happen
[57:37] what about it
[57:40] i thought
[57:43] i assume i guess we think that
[57:45] god is going to change his ways
[57:49] to fit what we think
[57:53] that makes us pretty important don't it
[57:57] but why struggle to be all of that
[58:03] when all we got to do
[58:05] is just believe
[58:07] what he says
[58:11] do you know that your salvation is based
[58:13] totally on believing what god says
[58:19] everything is based upon what god says
[58:28] but do we believe it right as i said
[58:31] want to go do we believe by the new
[58:33] birth that he has given us
[58:35] it in our soul not in the body because
[58:37] we're always going to be a problem but
[58:39] in our soul we're just as eternal as god
[58:41] is do we believe that
[58:46] you know what if we believe that we'll
[58:47] quit looking out there and looking back
[58:49] there we'll start looking at what's
[58:51] right here
[58:55] we start looking at ourselves and saying
[58:58] look what he has done for me
[59:05] look what he
[59:06] has made me
[59:12] well um brother dale i guess i could
[59:15] believe that in a way but that's
[59:21] of course
[59:22] you ask somebody else's opinion
[59:25] and they're going to bring you a lot of
[59:26] quotes
[59:29] but that's why i gave you these
[59:32] when they start quoting you just
[59:37] lay these out and say would you read
[59:39] this
[59:41] and explain why the prophet said
[59:45] we were the fullness of the godhead
[59:47] bodily
[59:48] explain explain why the prophet said
[59:51] that we're deity veiled in human flesh
[59:54] amen
[59:55] that the son of man is
[59:57] god
[59:58] the seed the word
[1:00:00] living in a people
[1:00:06] see you're good about questioning me
[1:00:09] but what about everybody else
[1:00:13] when i put it out and tell you why i
[1:00:16] believe
[1:00:17] what i believe
[1:00:25] see church
[1:00:27] time is fastly running out on us
[1:00:35] well it's supposed to be this supposed
[1:00:36] to be that
[1:00:38] that could happen in the next hour
[1:00:48] we got a president and the vice
[1:00:49] president
[1:00:51] and if both of those get killed who is
[1:00:53] it this
[1:00:55] who
[1:00:57] speaker of the house
[1:00:59] if that gets killed who's the next one
[1:01:01] you know you could have a woman as
[1:01:03] president in two minutes from now
[1:01:10] because you keep coming down that ladder
[1:01:11] you know if it blowed up about where all
[1:01:13] them was at you come down the ladder
[1:01:15] she could be president
[1:01:18] the pope could die and
[1:01:21] it would probably take a little longer
[1:01:24] to vote in a new pope
[1:01:26] than it would a president but in a few
[1:01:28] days you could have a new pope
[1:01:31] coming out of the united states
[1:01:40] but you see we're waiting on things to
[1:01:42] happen when
[1:01:44] my point is trying to get you to see it
[1:01:46] could have already happened and we
[1:01:47] didn't know it
[1:01:50] amen
[1:01:53] what about some questions what about
[1:01:55] some thoughts and comments go ahead and
[1:01:56] get the microphone
[1:01:58] i've got one and i'll use it while he's
[1:02:00] getting ready to
[1:02:02] for you
[1:02:04] i made this statement a few times and
[1:02:06] then i'll
[1:02:07] read the comment or the thought
[1:02:11] said could you talk more about being in
[1:02:13] the wrong ranks
[1:02:15] will not be an excuse at the rapture
[1:02:18] i used to think this was being somewhere
[1:02:20] worldly
[1:02:22] but is this more sitting under or in a
[1:02:26] message church
[1:02:27] that is doubting or deluding the message
[1:02:31] they are not taking all the word
[1:02:36] now here's the
[1:02:38] here's the point the prophet said it
[1:02:41] it's taken from 371
[1:02:45] a resume of the ages which coming out of
[1:02:47] the church age book
[1:02:49] has a lot to say about the
[1:02:51] things and they were given the food that
[1:02:53] come from idol worship
[1:02:56] bailey
[1:02:57] babylonian paganism wrapped up in
[1:02:59] christian
[1:03:00] terminology that very same spirit and
[1:03:03] doctrine is right amongst all
[1:03:05] protestants
[1:03:06] and it's called denomination
[1:03:09] nicolaitanism is organization
[1:03:13] humanizing the leadership of the church
[1:03:16] and thereby disposing the spirit
[1:03:20] you know doing away with the spirit
[1:03:21] human brain all right
[1:03:23] that's nickelodeonism that's why you got
[1:03:25] to conquer the laity
[1:03:27] balaamism is denominationalism
[1:03:33] which takes the church manual
[1:03:36] instead of the bible
[1:03:37] and right to this hour many of god's
[1:03:39] people are caught in the snare of
[1:03:42] denominationalism and god is crying to
[1:03:45] them come out of her my peace will let
[1:03:47] you be partakers of her sins as you
[1:03:49] receive not of her plagues you see they
[1:03:52] are ignorant
[1:03:54] but if the rapture should take place at
[1:03:57] this moment
[1:03:59] ignorance would be no court of appeal
[1:04:01] from the judgment of god for being in
[1:04:05] the wrong ranks
[1:04:10] wrong rights
[1:04:13] what about wrong ranks i said the
[1:04:15] military you just
[1:04:16] one whole step out you're okay cause you
[1:04:18] just you just move the whole rank but if
[1:04:20] you have a step out
[1:04:24] denominationalism
[1:04:28] being in the wrong ranks
[1:04:35] what about the people of this message
[1:04:38] would it not be wrong ranks to be taken
[1:04:41] what they're saying
[1:04:44] and the doctrines that they've preached
[1:04:48] would not not be wrong ranks
[1:04:52] and you can ignorantly sit there and
[1:04:56] think you're in the message
[1:05:00] let's bring it on down a little closer
[1:05:04] if we're sitting here in lula georgia
[1:05:10] and sympathizing with the message
[1:05:13] you need that quote from brother branham
[1:05:14] he said they sympathize with it
[1:05:17] to sympathize with something just to
[1:05:19] kind of go along with it and not fight
[1:05:21] against it right you sympathize with it
[1:05:23] you kind of pet the people
[1:05:26] that's why i always just tell you the
[1:05:28] way i stand
[1:05:30] and what i believe
[1:05:33] you can't say that i don't pity patter
[1:05:35] around
[1:05:36] i mean you can't say that i pity patter
[1:05:38] around to let you believe some great
[1:05:41] thing
[1:05:45] i try to tell you what it is
[1:05:49] but being at the wrong ranks is just
[1:05:51] flatly refusing
[1:05:53] to step into the word
[1:05:55] that is brought for the hour that we're
[1:05:57] living
[1:06:01] whether their answer could be then that
[1:06:03] wrong ranks
[1:06:10] what do you think about it
[1:06:14] you see we don't have no rights or
[1:06:16] thoughts to
[1:06:18] argue or bicker about things
[1:06:25] if this message is right then it's all
[1:06:27] right
[1:06:29] if not who's going to tell us what part
[1:06:31] of it is right and what part of it's
[1:06:32] wrong
[1:06:33] well that's where these brothers are
[1:06:35] doing it now
[1:06:37] they sure didn't do it when the prophet
[1:06:38] was alive
[1:06:43] and if the people of this message would
[1:06:45] just stand up and look them in the face
[1:06:47] and say that is not what the prophet
[1:06:50] said
[1:06:58] the two soul man was sitting down in
[1:07:00] augusta georgia years ago and
[1:07:02] the collie was there and brother dardy
[1:07:04] and my wife and husband
[1:07:06] my brother he made a statement said
[1:07:07] brother brown said so and so i said
[1:07:12] raise my hand
[1:07:14] said yeah i said red rhino didn't say
[1:07:16] that
[1:07:17] yes he did he said what i said
[1:07:20] brother you said to raise my hand
[1:07:22] if i had any question
[1:07:24] i won't know where he said it
[1:07:26] and this other brother that was there
[1:07:28] took it up and he said brother dale's
[1:07:30] right brother branham never said that
[1:07:32] he said well i'll make it my statement
[1:07:34] brother calling remember i told i said
[1:07:36] continue on
[1:07:39] that was his statement i didn't care but
[1:07:41] when he said brother brown said it
[1:07:47] when are we going to start doing that
[1:07:51] are we like a lot of them well
[1:07:53] that's his way of seeing it i didn't
[1:07:56] know they had a lot of ways of seeing
[1:07:58] things
[1:07:59] i thought there was one lord one faith
[1:08:02] one baptism
[1:08:03] so if that means if you're just got a
[1:08:05] whole bunch of opinions then father son
[1:08:07] holy ghost is okay then jesus name is
[1:08:10] okay
[1:08:12] and and three times backwards and three
[1:08:14] times forwards is okay and
[1:08:20] you see
[1:08:22] it's very serious
[1:08:24] this is life or death to me i don't know
[1:08:26] what you think about it
[1:08:31] so being in the wrong ranks is just
[1:08:34] simply walking
[1:08:38] one half a step out of the word
[1:08:43] just refusing something
[1:08:46] that is said
[1:08:48] at least you ought to have enough sense
[1:08:50] to be able when somebody says something
[1:08:51] say well you know read something to you
[1:08:53] i'll read to you these are fullness of
[1:08:55] the god everybody you or at least say
[1:08:56] well i just don't believe that
[1:08:58] you got hopes that way but when you say
[1:09:00] he was wrong
[1:09:05] then what hopes have we got
[1:09:09] that's what i mean wrong rights
[1:09:15] well everybody got to believe it your
[1:09:16] way the way it sounds brother dale i
[1:09:17] didn't say that we got to believe what
[1:09:19] the prophet said
[1:09:22] now you bring me any quote
[1:09:24] from anywhere in the prophet's message
[1:09:27] contrary to what i said tonight
[1:09:34] don't be silly
[1:09:36] i read all men there purposely
[1:09:39] we have the holy spirit by measure
[1:09:42] there is none of us has it by the
[1:09:44] fullness
[1:09:47] but put us all together
[1:09:49] and you got to fullness
[1:09:56] who be first what's your comments
[1:09:58] questions talks
[1:10:02] what do you think
[1:10:12] nobody has any comments any thoughts
[1:10:16] sister trudy
[1:10:18] sister trudy
[1:10:21] you know the worst thing about having a
[1:10:22] question won't ask it
[1:10:26] is having a question won't ask it
[1:10:30] the worst thing about having a question
[1:10:31] won't ask it is have a question and
[1:10:32] won't ask it
[1:10:34] right go ahead
[1:10:36] well you were reading where brother
[1:10:37] branham said why do we always refuse to
[1:10:40] believe who he says we are
[1:10:43] i know personally i feel that
[1:10:46] um
[1:10:47] to me it's a lack of patience god's
[1:10:50] patience
[1:10:51] to wait on him for the results
[1:10:54] signs and wonders
[1:10:57] yeah
[1:10:58] yeah and i know that's not important but
[1:11:02] that's that's my thoughts on it
[1:11:05] no problems with wanting signs and
[1:11:06] wonders
[1:11:08] because they will follow the word
[1:11:12] signs and wonders to believe the word
[1:11:14] that's where we mess up right
[1:11:19] if we can't believe it without having
[1:11:21] signs and wonders that's where we mess
[1:11:22] up
[1:11:27] i thought was supposed to believe what
[1:11:28] he's saying
[1:11:32] but it's constantly said the same
[1:11:35] the same life that he lived the same
[1:11:37] things he does exactly but we're
[1:11:40] expecting it too soon right when we want
[1:11:43] it
[1:11:44] no
[1:11:46] i was expected in 1969 when i preached
[1:11:49] it
[1:11:50] you know what i was expecting then i was
[1:11:51] expecting the church to start honoring
[1:11:53] glory hallelujah the bride of jesus
[1:11:56] christ is the son of man
[1:11:58] you know what i got
[1:12:04] same thing i'm getting right here
[1:12:06] tonight
[1:12:08] couldn't tell a thing in the world about
[1:12:10] what you believe
[1:12:13] so i have to not believe in signs and
[1:12:15] wonders
[1:12:19] now did you catch that
[1:12:21] because your signs and wonders is
[1:12:22] showing me you don't believe it
[1:12:26] right
[1:12:28] go ahead and see it
[1:12:31] there's an anointing that's supposed to
[1:12:32] come at the end right
[1:12:35] um
[1:12:36] is that what will bring the revelation
[1:12:38] of the rapture
[1:12:43] i believe in the anointing that
[1:12:45] comes in the end time will come the
[1:12:47] revelation of the rapture yes
[1:12:50] you know the prophet said she'd be
[1:12:52] waiting for the revelation
[1:12:53] i believe that there is a revelation
[1:12:55] that will take place
[1:12:57] and it'll be when the head unites with
[1:12:59] the body
[1:13:02] now what gets me in trouble is being too
[1:13:05] simple
[1:13:07] for people to follow what you're saying
[1:13:10] what was the
[1:13:12] revelation
[1:13:17] after the resurrection of the lord jesus
[1:13:22] that he told him to go tell everybody
[1:13:26] he's here
[1:13:29] he's risen
[1:13:30] he's here
[1:13:34] why would a prophet say he's here
[1:13:37] because he believed he was there
[1:13:40] you know what he was to him
[1:13:43] we're living under our privilege
[1:13:45] in the basis that we don't accept what
[1:13:47] is said
[1:13:52] i'll look for a time to come and
[1:13:53] there'll be such an outpouring of the
[1:13:55] holy spirit that will feel every fiber
[1:13:56] of our being and we'll go into rapture
[1:13:58] i'll look for that
[1:14:00] but if we're not in the right place
[1:14:03] there's your wrong ranks
[1:14:05] if we're not in the right place what
[1:14:07] good would it do for the anointing to
[1:14:12] fall if you're not pre-programmed and
[1:14:16] sitting there
[1:14:19] you know knowing the word of what it's
[1:14:21] supposed to be how would you know what
[1:14:22] it is because it's going to be falling
[1:14:24] on everything
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:31] and it's going to be a little while now
[1:14:32] i'm putting it all together
[1:14:35] it's going to be a little while that
[1:14:37] it's poured out on everything
[1:14:40] but then i do believe that there'll come
[1:14:42] a time
[1:14:43] just before that change
[1:14:46] that god's going to shut her down
[1:14:49] in everything
[1:14:51] but the bride
[1:14:54] i believe that
[1:14:56] i've always believed it that way that
[1:14:58] when that bride comes to that place and
[1:15:00] gets in her place
[1:15:02] he's going to shut her down
[1:15:05] and they won't be able to do nothing
[1:15:09] around the city of shore to the world
[1:15:11] for just a moment
[1:15:17] i'm looking forward to a lot of things
[1:15:20] but just don't miss what's going on
[1:15:23] because it won't do no good to get there
[1:15:29] it won't do it better good for us to get
[1:15:30] there if we don't know what to expect
[1:15:35] go back in your mind a minute
[1:15:37] to where you first heard of this message
[1:15:42] did you believe it right off
[1:15:46] no
[1:15:47] you fought it like crazy
[1:15:50] you know why because he's confused
[1:15:56] right
[1:15:57] amen
[1:15:59] but now
[1:16:00] somebody can read to you and we can go
[1:16:02] to the meetings and be somewhere and
[1:16:04] somebody will get up and say
[1:16:07] the bride is the fullness of the godhead
[1:16:09] bodily
[1:16:10] three-quarters of people going
[1:16:13] in the lula church in holland hey
[1:16:15] man
[1:16:17] why
[1:16:20] because
[1:16:21] we know that's true
[1:16:24] right right
[1:16:27] anymore
[1:16:30] brother brother how
[1:16:34] think about it
[1:16:40] but sam
[1:16:41] i reckon what i want to do in a ways
[1:16:42] testify
[1:16:44] first i want to tell you thank you for
[1:16:46] what you've been preaching
[1:16:49] thank you for all the series that you've
[1:16:51] preached here lately
[1:16:53] in that
[1:16:55] and in my following what you're
[1:16:56] preaching god has changed me completely
[1:16:58] i told you a while back i was ashamed of
[1:17:00] the way i'd lived because i've wasted so
[1:17:02] much time and hadn't gotten closer to
[1:17:04] god well i'm still ashamed but i'm a lot
[1:17:07] closer to god than i was then amen
[1:17:10] i was looking for miracles and this and
[1:17:12] that and the other
[1:17:13] but you know we can be looking for god
[1:17:15] to be doing one thing and he's trying
[1:17:17] his best to do something else that's
[1:17:18] better for us and we're missing and i'm
[1:17:21] talking from my experience
[1:17:24] but i have come to a place
[1:17:27] in the last year and a half two years i
[1:17:29] i don't know in the last period of time
[1:17:32] here
[1:17:34] that my outlook towards god has changed
[1:17:37] just decidedly
[1:17:40] i know what you're preaching is the
[1:17:41] truth
[1:17:42] and my word to anybody here including me
[1:17:45] especially to me
[1:17:47] is you better get every word that's
[1:17:48] coming across that pulpit
[1:17:50] because you mess around and miss it you
[1:17:52] might not make it
[1:17:53] and you know you're what you're saying
[1:17:56] we can sit right here
[1:17:58] and just kind of slough it off instead
[1:18:00] of taking it in
[1:18:02] and we're in the wrong ranks right we've
[1:18:03] got the wrong attitude towards the word
[1:18:05] of god god forgive me for that
[1:18:08] and help me
[1:18:09] to be more sincere and more dedicated
[1:18:11] than i've been being
[1:18:13] so
[1:18:14] just a real i've got a real desire just
[1:18:16] to pick up and he's he's feeding me i
[1:18:19] got fed in what you said tonight brother
[1:18:22] and i go home and go through these notes
[1:18:24] and listen again i'll get fed again
[1:18:27] and if i don't i won't
[1:18:29] and i say that to everybody here
[1:18:34] the main thing is that i wish you would
[1:18:36] do with the notes
[1:18:40] to show you how much i believe it and
[1:18:41] what he's saying
[1:18:44] i wish you would start the first
[1:18:46] one
[1:18:48] and you'd listen to that message
[1:18:52] the good shepherd of the sheep
[1:18:57] and i don't mean you got to do it in a
[1:18:58] certain order
[1:19:00] do you understand
[1:19:02] go down and listen to the next one
[1:19:05] see if what i've said
[1:19:08] is
[1:19:10] in continuity
[1:19:12] with all that said on that tape
[1:19:19] you're going to find a whole lot more
[1:19:22] than what i've said
[1:19:27] you're going to find it
[1:19:29] brother i haven't just
[1:19:31] let him finish
[1:19:33] one more comment
[1:19:35] the notes
[1:19:37] is what changed me
[1:19:38] i hit a place in the notes and i saw
[1:19:40] something as quick as i read through it
[1:19:42] god revealed it
[1:19:44] so i'll just give you that much
[1:19:45] testimony back in what you're saying
[1:19:47] about the notes get on
[1:19:49] they'll mean something to you
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:53] uh i just wanted to say that
[1:19:56] this morning uh hank called me and we
[1:19:58] were talking and he was saying that
[1:20:00] we're nobody's perfect nobody no man is
[1:20:03] perfect and i said no i said but
[1:20:07] and i want you to correct me if i'm
[1:20:08] wrong
[1:20:09] that if we're striving
[1:20:11] for eternal life
[1:20:13] then we're striving for perfection
[1:20:16] right
[1:20:17] so that's what i told him and i just
[1:20:18] wanted to make sure that that was the
[1:20:20] right thing to have said to him
[1:20:23] so
[1:20:24] that was all i wanted to say
[1:20:28] and see if you have the new birth that
[1:20:30] is eternal life
[1:20:32] but there's a law and it's perfect and
[1:20:34] there's a lot of growing to be taking
[1:20:37] place in these old bodies that we are
[1:20:40] a lot of old self got to get out of the
[1:20:43] way
[1:20:46] and die to that
[1:20:48] that's just a kale
[1:20:53] this is not a great intelligence
[1:20:56] but
[1:20:58] it's not that we don't believe what
[1:21:00] you're saying
[1:21:02] it's just that the thought is a new
[1:21:04] thought it's like one god from trinity
[1:21:07] you know what i'm saying exactly and you
[1:21:09] don't just
[1:21:10] you don't just go into that and
[1:21:12] understand some people might but i'm not
[1:21:14] that way
[1:21:16] and you're the kind of preacher you are
[1:21:18] because of me
[1:21:19] i have to have it said to me over more
[1:21:22] than one time you know
[1:21:24] and we we have to let god deal with each
[1:21:26] person at their time right
[1:21:28] and like
[1:21:30] with me it's sometimes it's like
[1:21:33] god living in me how can i be so hateful
[1:21:36] how can i say this how can i feel this
[1:21:39] how can i think this god would live in
[1:21:41] that you know as a matter of fact i
[1:21:44] think i said that to myself today
[1:21:46] uh
[1:21:48] and then i think well it's not this body
[1:21:51] this flesh
[1:21:53] he's in my heart and in my soul right if
[1:21:55] i just let him take over exactly that's
[1:21:58] the problem
[1:21:59] that's the problem it's not we don't
[1:22:01] believe you but we and i know we may not
[1:22:04] have a lot of time but one thing i know
[1:22:06] about god his timing is perfect if we're
[1:22:09] going to be there we'll be there you
[1:22:11] know what i mean so don't get
[1:22:13] discouraged that we don't believe you
[1:22:15] because that's not the case it's just
[1:22:17] that some of us are slow-minded and i'm
[1:22:19] one of them
[1:22:20] okay okay
[1:22:22] who's next
[1:22:25] i know one time years ago the lord spoke
[1:22:27] to me
[1:22:28] and the only time that i've ever said
[1:22:30] anything about the statue of a perfect
[1:22:31] man
[1:22:32] of where i was or what was talking about
[1:22:35] it people are saying well brother dale i
[1:22:37] believe you're up here and somebody say
[1:22:39] i believe you're here so much
[1:22:42] that ain't gonna help you anyway
[1:22:44] but
[1:22:46] he spoke to me one day
[1:22:48] and he said if you'll have patience
[1:22:51] with the people
[1:22:53] because it'll prove you got patience
[1:22:56] well you can't argue that point
[1:23:01] you can't
[1:23:02] when he tells you
[1:23:04] you have patience with the people
[1:23:07] i know sometimes it gets hard and
[1:23:09] everything because i want you to see it
[1:23:11] but i know too what you're saying
[1:23:13] i know the reason that i'm not
[1:23:15] out on the field preaching i know that i
[1:23:18] understand that it's no problem
[1:23:21] i just know that the people don't
[1:23:22] understand
[1:23:24] what i'm trying to bring
[1:23:27] and i'm not talking about out on the
[1:23:29] field in the difference of that i'm
[1:23:31] talking about
[1:23:32] even in the people that closely related
[1:23:35] it just i just got to losing all
[1:23:39] and just people oh they're my brothers
[1:23:41] they love me
[1:23:42] but they don't understand me
[1:23:46] and i don't understand myself
[1:23:49] but i've got one goal in mind
[1:23:54] lord let me look out of hell
[1:23:57] and see
[1:23:59] you sitting in heaven
[1:24:02] and i'll be happy
[1:24:07] that's the only desire that i've got
[1:24:11] is for you to see the word
[1:24:16] who's that who got it
[1:24:18] no that's not nothing that's me
[1:24:20] i've done that 40 something years
[1:24:25] who's next anybody else
[1:24:36] like sister gayle's talking about
[1:24:39] we do things that we're ashamed of
[1:24:42] well i had my own blood brother hit me
[1:24:45] this week
[1:24:47] we were talking about raising children
[1:24:52] and he was talking about when he would
[1:24:53] get mad at his children and this and
[1:24:54] that and the other
[1:24:56] he said his wife would turn and turn and
[1:24:58] look at him and say what are you
[1:24:59] teaching
[1:25:01] think about it mm-hmm
[1:25:05] it'll be nice
[1:25:07] right
[1:25:09] anybody else
[1:25:13] you see just think about
[1:25:17] what god has given you and i
[1:25:22] the opportunity
[1:25:25] to hear
[1:25:27] what the bible says the prophets
[1:25:30] desire to look into
[1:25:32] but was not able to see it that's right
[1:25:38] take this little group of people here
[1:25:40] and put them out there among the people
[1:25:42] of the message
[1:25:46] and i get the comments back or somebody
[1:25:48] will say you go to church at lula
[1:25:52] well you know what that's that makes me
[1:25:54] feel good
[1:25:57] you're my kids
[1:26:00] and sometimes i get like a mean old
[1:26:02] daddy
[1:26:03] but i want to see you line up and do
[1:26:04] what's right
[1:26:07] but you remember one thing i was
[1:26:08] thinking about it when sister trudy was
[1:26:10] talking don't ever think that brother
[1:26:11] dale don't believe in signs and wonders
[1:26:14] you get that out of your mind
[1:26:17] i look for it
[1:26:19] i just don't put them first
[1:26:23] i never counted a new birth as to a time
[1:26:26] when i saw god in a church
[1:26:28] i never counted that a new birth
[1:26:32] i never counted because i come into this
[1:26:34] message a new birth
[1:26:38] i never counted because i've seen an
[1:26:39] angel in my home three different
[1:26:41] occasions i don't count none of that
[1:26:46] as a new birth
[1:26:50] because all of that can be imitated
[1:26:53] but the one thing that satan can't do
[1:26:56] is fight that word
[1:26:59] when you believe it
[1:27:04] when you believe it and it's revealed to
[1:27:05] you you watch that devil turn away from
[1:27:08] you
[1:27:09] brother kept saying something one time
[1:27:11] looking the other way and i just tapped
[1:27:13] him on the shoulder
[1:27:16] i said brother
[1:27:17] and i wouldn't arrogant hateful i said
[1:27:19] turn around and tell me you didn't say
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:26] he wasn't afraid of me
[1:27:28] he's afraid of what was because he knew
[1:27:32] that he said it to me
[1:27:37] and he wouldn't turn and do that
[1:27:39] so i'm not afraid of no devil nowhere
[1:27:46] because i know he can't handle the word
[1:27:52] just keep quoting it to him
[1:27:57] and he'll just have to back off he can't
[1:27:58] do nothing else come on musicians
[1:28:02] think on these things
[1:28:04] what do you believe brother dale
[1:28:06] i believe
[1:28:08] that we must recognize who we are and
[1:28:10] what we're doing
[1:28:12] and where we're at
[1:28:16] and we have the ability to do that
[1:28:18] because we have a message
[1:28:22] that has been brought to us to show who
[1:28:24] we are
[1:28:25] i believe in signs and wonders more than
[1:28:28] you do
[1:28:31] i don't mean that derogatory now i mean
[1:28:33] it disappointed i
[1:28:34] know myself
[1:28:36] you got to believe that you know
[1:28:37] yourself
[1:28:42] i never let that
[1:28:44] stand in my way
[1:28:46] i build it use it as a building stepping
[1:28:48] stone
[1:28:52] because i believe it
[1:28:56] why could you have so much confidence
[1:28:57] brother dale to say that your son wade
[1:29:00] would come back to the lord
[1:29:03] and that he would be standing in the
[1:29:04] pulpit beside of you
[1:29:07] because i believe what he tells me
[1:29:11] and you know why i believe that
[1:29:16] because i read in the bible one day
[1:29:20] a lot of you can remember real good but
[1:29:22] i can't
[1:29:24] i'll be glad to find it for you it says
[1:29:26] you'll be there with your offspring
[1:29:29] so isaiah awaits us
[1:29:32] i believe that
[1:29:35] you'll be there with your offspring
[1:29:37] i believe that
[1:29:40] that's greater than an audible voice
[1:29:44] can't be questioned
[1:29:48] because it's what god said
[1:29:52] don't need no signs and wonders to
[1:29:53] follow that but then they'll always be
[1:29:55] signs and wonder
[1:30:00] there'll always be something to prove it
[1:30:04] as i said i waited and waited until
[1:30:06] god come on the scene and brought to
[1:30:08] pass
[1:30:09] six times the dead raised among us
[1:30:12] many many different things that has
[1:30:14] happened among us
[1:30:16] that we have been there and witnessed
[1:30:20] and then you tell me i don't believe in
[1:30:21] signs and wonders
[1:30:26] i believe in manifestations of the holy
[1:30:28] spirit
[1:30:30] i believe the word comes first
[1:30:36] that way i can know where the
[1:30:37] manifestation's right or not
[1:30:39] because i got the scripture to stand on
[1:30:41] i'm dwelling on the scripture
[1:30:44] and it's not a question of what this is
[1:30:45] or what that is what do you say let's
[1:30:47] stand together
[1:30:48] can i say something you talk about
[1:30:50] signing one or whatever like that
[1:30:53] i hear that a lot a lot you know and
[1:30:56] people tell them what's happened in
[1:30:58] their lives and one day
[1:31:00] you know i come in here how long ago it
[1:31:02] was years two or three years ago trying
[1:31:04] to get you to help me find the scripture
[1:31:07] we found out it says you can speak with
[1:31:08] tongue of men no excuse me
[1:31:11] uh they said lord lord yeah he says we
[1:31:14] cast out demons in your name we've done
[1:31:16] many many wonderful works in your name
[1:31:19] now they've done that sure
[1:31:21] but they've never had a personal
[1:31:22] relationship right exactly
[1:31:25] exactly so that's you know who read for
[1:31:28] signs and wonders it doesn't you don't
[1:31:30] have to be saved to get here
[1:31:34] he heals lobster
[1:31:36] in fact that anybody's that is healed of
[1:31:39] anything a toothache whatever
[1:31:44] god here exactly i believe that
[1:31:47] exactly
[1:31:49] so science and wonders
[1:31:52] are great i enjoy seeing them
[1:31:56] but you can have signs and wonders
[1:31:59] and not have a personal relationship
[1:32:01] with the lord jesus christ exactly
[1:32:04] what was brother harris's faithful
[1:32:06] statement
[1:32:08] signs father believers believers don't
[1:32:10] follow signs
[1:32:12] right
[1:32:18] i was down with my eye you remember that
[1:32:20] i was out of church for a good while
[1:32:23] well i was laying on the bed and uh
[1:32:26] brother harrison uh
[1:32:29] several of them was was coming to give
[1:32:31] his communion right
[1:32:33] and when peggy said that uh they're here
[1:32:38] i was laying in bed i was almost dead
[1:32:41] i heard so bad and i can't tell you all
[1:32:43] the places but i went to i i put a
[1:32:46] repository on my
[1:32:48] rear end
[1:32:50] and god it hurt i mean i was in there
[1:32:52] trying to dig it out
[1:32:55] and uh i finally i said i can't receive
[1:32:57] him
[1:32:58] like this peggy i just can't and i come
[1:33:01] back in and laid on the bed and i
[1:33:03] started hyperventilating she thought i
[1:33:05] was fixing 92.
[1:33:07] and they came in in my bedroom sister
[1:33:10] michael was there too brook collie was
[1:33:12] there
[1:33:13] and uh
[1:33:16] they began to pray for me and i stopped
[1:33:19] hopping hyperventilating just
[1:33:26] come over and give me the wine i i mean
[1:33:29] the uh the bread and put it on my tongue
[1:33:32] and uh i don't know if i did the piggy
[1:33:34] did or he did i remember i was in that
[1:33:36] bad shape he gave me the wine and when
[1:33:39] that wine touched my tongue
[1:33:42] i can't tell you it was like a fire it
[1:33:45] was something
[1:33:46] hug it was something stopped here and
[1:33:49] all at once it just
[1:33:51] boom it was gone and i began to speak in
[1:33:54] tongues
[1:33:55] you know 15 20 minutes i guess but my
[1:33:58] point is this
[1:33:59] i couldn't sit down
[1:34:02] i was i was sitting on the side of the
[1:34:03] bed it would give me the the community
[1:34:05] and i couldn't stay it because i knew
[1:34:08] who it was talking
[1:34:10] i didn't ask for this
[1:34:12] i didn't ask to be able to do this he
[1:34:15] did it right and i knew that it was him
[1:34:18] talking
[1:34:20] i don't you see it i've had people say
[1:34:22] well did anybody interpret it he did
[1:34:23] himself
[1:34:25] he did it
[1:34:27] but my point is this
[1:34:29] on gifts in college
[1:34:31] you know
[1:34:32] if you're a true born again christian
[1:34:35] you know the truth of the matter you
[1:34:37] know who it is i mean it it ain't no i
[1:34:41] will hope spoke nothing you know who it
[1:34:44] is and then when i i
[1:34:46] walked over and my wife was right here
[1:34:49] and i and i and i blessed to started
[1:34:51] blessing in the name of lord jesus
[1:34:53] christ i mean i knew it wasn't me
[1:34:56] and i took my wife and i and i just kind
[1:34:58] of pulled up this way it's a blessing in
[1:35:01] the name of jesus christ and i started
[1:35:03] walking back to the people there was
[1:35:04] eight of us killing me
[1:35:06] and they was in the room and i i began
[1:35:08] to to walk to him
[1:35:10] the guys and and i hugged them and shook
[1:35:14] their hands and blessed him in the name
[1:35:16] of the lord well there was a brother
[1:35:17] there
[1:35:18] that thought that i was going to do that
[1:35:21] with the sisters
[1:35:22] i didn't i don't know why but but i i
[1:35:25] knew it
[1:35:26] i knew it
[1:35:27] and and when i come to the sisters i
[1:35:29] stuck my hand out
[1:35:30] and said bless you in the name of the
[1:35:31] lord jesus christ i come back i sat down
[1:35:34] on the edge of the bill over the foot of
[1:35:36] the bed
[1:35:37] and he began to speak again
[1:35:39] he said fear not you desire
[1:35:42] i'll never leave you i'll never forsake
[1:35:45] you and the last thing he said should be
[1:35:46] not afraid right
[1:35:48] that wasn't the end
[1:35:50] i think so when i
[1:35:52] i mean i was getting better all the time
[1:35:54] and i and i says brother sisters let's
[1:35:57] go down to the liver you know where i
[1:35:58] lived in duluth i said let's go down and
[1:36:01] i just had my
[1:36:02] warm-up pants on in a in a t-shirt
[1:36:05] and i was just weeping and as i started
[1:36:08] down the steps the sisters it was all
[1:36:10] around and i started god is my witness i
[1:36:13] started to take my shirt and wipe my
[1:36:15] face
[1:36:16] and i started before i broke to where
[1:36:18] the skin was at
[1:36:20] he jerked my hand back
[1:36:23] since down
[1:36:23] milk has seen it i don't know who else
[1:36:25] to see but he would not let me do that
[1:36:28] so i i'm telling you you know when god's
[1:36:31] on the scene you ain't got to guess
[1:36:33] about it right you know it gifts and
[1:36:36] wonders and colors god god does it
[1:36:39] himself and he backs it up exactly
[1:36:42] and you don't have to worry then that's
[1:36:44] right
[1:36:45] one comment i'd like to make about when
[1:36:47] this took place was that when
[1:36:50] dean started speaking and it was the
[1:36:52] lord interpreting
[1:36:53] the tongues
[1:36:55] it was his voice
[1:36:56] but it was not his mannerism
[1:36:59] i knew i knew who it was
[1:37:02] i knew i knew i mean i knew that it was
[1:37:05] going on i knew who it was
[1:37:09] that's why we believe
[1:37:10] signs and wonders and gifts and miracles
[1:37:14] we believe it
[1:37:17] because you know what
[1:37:18] the word said it'd be here
[1:37:23] everything just put it back in here
[1:37:28] you don't have to worry about it you put
[1:37:29] it back in here
[1:37:31] it'll be the right answer go ahead
[1:37:32] brother listen anybody have a need
[1:37:45] you have a need to alter it over
[1:37:48] i believe god is
[1:37:51] desiring
[1:37:53] to move among us in a mighty way
[1:37:56] i look forward to it every day
[1:38:00] if i pray a prayer for anybody and they
[1:38:02] don't get healed
[1:38:04] i don't blame them i blame myself
[1:38:07] and i say god what's wrong
[1:38:16] i bless your name
[1:38:22] i just have a prize uh today my friend
[1:38:55] you're
