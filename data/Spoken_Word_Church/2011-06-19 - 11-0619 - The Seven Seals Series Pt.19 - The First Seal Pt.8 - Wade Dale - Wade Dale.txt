TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so good to see everybody today to see you be in the house of the Lord Happy Father's Day to all you fathers father thank you mothers for making us father amen amen CU without you we wouldn't be a father what Jen said she said what do you want for Father's Day I said you you made me one you made me a father so and I meant it you want go yeah I didn't go fishing the first time yish yeah you want where you want to go just go ahead and tell me go ahead and tell me where you want to go season coming up don't worry Montana Montana fish fish okay fish Mont stay the Hun seon you're going I'm going all right yeah there some places Jun won't go with me some you will and they some she will Montana she will so we need to pick some other ouch we're on emotional roller coaster today she loves me she hates me she loves all right let's turn to Isaiah and let's kind of take a little different angle on this first seal not a different angle but maybe uh maybe we can see a little more about this man of s 14 Isaiah 14 we're going to start with verse 12 mil you sure you don't need that thing just w Wait a minute let me put it straight and don't let itate put it straight over there makes too much noise sorry I thinking about your lovely wife being cold over there okay Isaiah 14 continuing on the first seal let's just background a few minutes we looked at the man of sin in first in 2 Thessalonians correct so this man of sin must be exposed as we've said before we need to see that guy or that person going away from us we we don't want that person to reside in anything that we are all right that's why the first seal is so important when you see the revelation of one true and living God and how he comes come to you not a second person or a third person but the person of almighty God the one that created the heavens and earth come to you at a new birth and drove Satan out of your soul correct right drove him out but now you got to remember one thing when God cursed the Earth back in Genesis brother randam said the title deed went back to God of course he's the one that created it but there's a squatter there's one in between you and God called the devil this kin to you because of this thing right cuz when he caused Eve to do what she did Adam to do what he did made that that Son of God fall not lose eternal life in his soul but he lost eternal life in this thing right here this is what this is what we must we must overcome and just like we're talking about conquering and to conquer God's Got To Conquer our you can't do it I can't do it and the devil don't want you to do it the devil don't want to do it either long as he's got this thing right here and it can die and will die he's always got a little hold or a little grip brother rown calls him a squatter now squatters you see them a lot in other countries you don't see them as much here in the United States because we own all of our land but like in Jamaica there were squatters they would go and just build a house on a piece of property cuz there was nothing there what they never had a title deal to that piece of property but as long as somebody didn't walk up and say hey I got the title deed to this property you need to leave that stay there forever well that's what the devil is he stayed on this ground called this Earth forever Satan Satan's not worried so much about the round ball of Earth he he wants your Earth he wants what come out of it right and God cursed the Earth so that's where your body came out of so we have a curse on this thing but now when God raised from the dead where we see one one true and living God come into Focus that that God died in human flesh that God raised in that same human flesh quickened that mortal body and then Romans 8 says that same spirit that raised up that man from the dead will also Quicken your mortal body all right by what by his spirit that dwells in you all right excuse me so now we know that this man of sin then is very prevalent he's always been right there but he's hid himself like God has hid himself in Simplicity Satan has hid himself in religion right he know not to hide himself in the drunk and the and the prostitute and The Gambler and the smoker and the Drinker and the carouser and the adult that's obvious that's right right that's obvious right so where does he want to hide himself in religion that's right cuz that's where the deception is there is no deception if a man walked in here with earrings in both ears and shut a beard down in front of him and had two women on on each side of him we'd know for sure one thing he wasn't a godly man that's right but now what about a man walks in here with a suit and a tie on sits down sits in the congregation or Gets behind the pull pit that's right yes this is the seat of Satan that's right if you allow that to be the seat of Satan right all right so this is where the deception is and I've told you before many times people you realize one thing that here is where Satan really wants to not out there cuz if he can be here he's got out there okay same way with the denominations he fed them Trinity they ate it up so he's got them that's right fed them one set fed them one way of baptism which is wrong brother Brown said come from the pits of Hell father son Holy Ghost baptism come from the pits of hell why why did it come from the pits of Hell father Son and Holy Ghost baptism didn't come from the pits of hell when Jesus spoke it that was the true word of God Satan took and twisted it a little bit and said okay that's your baptism so you've done away with the name of Lord Jesus Christ now it's just a title right a squatter that's right that's a squatter that's right he's squatting on people's property right religious people that's right us that's right message people all of us he's got he's got a I don't say let me try to say this right but he's got a little bit of authority from God to do the things he's doing yes okay CU God allowed or God give him power was given remember cuz we're going to read right here this guy was a bluff to begin with and watch he has bluffed us so much he's made us believe in that father son Holy Ghost baptism in that Trinity in that hell being Eternal and all the things like that Satan really wished hell was eternal cuz he'd be he have eternal life see the see the see the thing in his mind he wants to be us Satan wants to be us that's right and he wants hell to be Eternal cuz he knows if he if hell if he can make people believe hell's Eternal then then what do they do see they they say well you know this is that and this is the other but if hell's Eternal brother B said if hell was eternal you'd have to have eternal life and if you have eternal life you got God so that's what the seed of Satan wants to be want not be like God he wants to be God that's right all right that's right so now and that's what he wants to be in your life he wants to be the god of your life all right so now let's read right here let's read what this guy really is all right Isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning now see Jesus Christ is the Morning Star Satan is the son of the morning so close I want to show you something real close in just a second how are thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nation the ground remember the Earth is what's cursed for thou H has said in thine heart in other words the very being of Satan your heart's where everything is right as a man thinketh in his heart heart so is he right and heart is not this thing it's the it's the inner core of you that's right the inner part all right that's the heart of you cuz brother R said Jesus Christ was the very Heart Of God it wasn't God's heart no he was the very Soul substance being personality of God nothing separate from God for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven now so where was he ascend means go up so where was he he was on the earth yeah all right I will exalt my throne above the stars of God now who are the stars of God you and I remember the Stars Seven Stars God held in his hand he wants to exalt himself above those seven chch days Messengers those prophets all right I will sit also upon the mountain of the congregation in the sides of the North now there is a scripture that I didn't have time to look up but I'll look it up maybe for next time that that's where you and I are supposed to reside the congregation on the side of the north the city of the great king remember we sang the song All right so Satan don't want to be in the South and us be in the north right Satan don't want to be in the west and us be in the East all right he wants to be right there I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high now this is the Old Testament he want wants to be like God when we read 2 Thessalonians he sees how the baptism of the Holy Ghost changes people's lives and he wants to get into the people just like God gets into the people at the baptism of the Holy Ghost so he don't want to be like God he just worship as he is God remember we read that we'll watch how he evolves I'll read it again okay excuse me I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee not literally so much see means to what understand let's read it like that they that understand thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider the saying is this the man that made the the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners and I wrote in my Bible Satan truly is a bluff he had no power is this if we look on this person and say is this the man in other words we are looking at the understanding that this man has no power and look how he tricked he bluffed the Nations he bluffed the people he bluffed religion he bluffed his way all the way from Heaven down to here cuz there's no way you can defeat God if God cre if somebody created you guess what he's got one up on you that's right you know we say the old say old father said I'll bring you into this world I'll I'll take you out well guess what God brought Satan into the world and guess what God's going to take him out right I mean that's a true statement I mean we say that in laughing but it's the truth why because we formed them we made them we made the children we we other words we're telling them hey as long as you're my son I got one up on you cuz I'm your daddy that's right I don't know how big a guy is it doesn't make any difference how big your children get they should always respect their parents any or their father anyway but listen they that see thee and I underline that double underline output me cuz see Isaiah is prophesying they in other words there's a point somewhere they they that understand you are going to say this statement is this the man see people this right here is when death is destroyed in your flesh right here all right this is when death is destroyed in your flesh right here when you see or understand that that man is a bluff because where is the greatest battle is in our mind that's right and Satan roams around in that thing just like his his that's right but we have the word of God that promised us that someday somebody's going to be able to overcome cuz see we're supposed to have the mind of Christ anyway that's true and even but see the mind of Christ does not always say well it's that same brain that Jesus walked no the same brain that Jesus walked on the earth with with was tempted that's right tried and tested but he's without sin amen huh right a human mortal brain yet without sin yes now if we're supposed to have the mind of Christ guess what we're not going to we're not going to dwell on the thoughts that come that's true but we're going to cast them out that's right cuz remember the casting out of the red dragon is not just the casting out of religion or what that's the casting out of the red dragon that's in me and you right the white dog black dog is fighting like this right here War tell me one thing for sure when you weren't born again was there a fight in your mind no you picked the beer up and drank it you went to the Beer Joint you went and bought beer and wine liquor didn't B I mean it was like all it just like me and you going to church now you just went right come on people yes did you have a fight sure there was listen now there was times that God would convict me sure enough about things cuz I knew the right I knew I grew up in this message I knew the right part but see I overrode that because there was nothing inside of me to raise up that's true or I wouldn't have done the things I did but see he did those things Jesus come and was raised up as a child just like me and you okay come up to an adulthood come through puberty come through done all the things all the little things that we all went through he went through and some of the older ones said one time I said well he didn't go through old age he died at 30 the Bible said he looked over 50 years old so in his body he was bearing the marks of an older person and when he died at Calvary brother Brown said he died for everybody so he died for all the arthritis and everything that gets you at the end of your age he overtook that there's no God don't look at age and say well I can't heal him cuz he's got arthritis and he's 80 no look at that um brother um Upshaw Congressman Upshaw 60 something years he laid on his back and when he was 12 years old so that made him 82 years old Lord let him live about five more years to go around the country and tell the people how he was healed he was healed at 80 years old 82 years old from being paralyzed for 60 years but you know what we look at people and go well they're just getting old well that's true you're going to have aches and pains Jesus had aches and pain but when we overcome that thing and say God it's not the symptom we're looking at right is we're able to see where that symptom comes from a bluff that symptom comes from a bluff Satan is bluffing us because what are we going to live in what are we going to live in when we when we take the change what are we going to live in the body you're in right now right okay we're not going to be gray-headed but remember back when you about 24 years old 23 man you could just do that's what we're going back to but you say well we're getting older somebody's going to realize one day that that is lying vanity remember in in the Book of Proverbs I believe it say talks about ly job talks about lying vanity it's just lying vanity a li that's right we're we're actually in our body we're living a lie it is but it was a lie that Satan told Eve remember we read it in second Thessalonians it was the lie not a li it was the lie that Satan told e so our bodies are living a lie because inside of you right now doesn't matter how old you are today there's an 18 to 20 year old person inside of you that's right a 20-y old trapped in a 70 year old body or 50 or 40 or 30 or whatever all of us see when we come to the realization of that that that body is more real than this one that your mom and daddy brought that's when this one's going to take over the outside man right right cuz when Jesus went to hell paid the price when he come back up when he stepped into that body think about this when he stepped into that body that body was laying brother R said laying dead and cold in the grave hadn't started deteriorating yet but it was beginning to the process was started cuz they couldn't see corruption but hey when that thing died the blood vessels went black everything went all that nasty stuff that death is involved with but when he come back and got into that body and raised it up it wasn't beaten bruised his beard was not pulled out of his face sure he still had the scar here and the scars in his hand because that's mine and your sin but they striped his back all that became new but where was that that was that same man that was in MDC that spoke to Abraham and at calf that was the same theophany man that was there everybody understand that God is not an old man everybody has a portraying of God being this old withered up thing with a long no my God's a youthful 20 year old man never has been nothing else never will be nothing else that's that's the that's the mystery that you and I have to see in this end time amen is that what's inside of you is more real now at the new birth now if you're not born again you still got the old adamic nature you still got the old uh black soul right right you still got the old old nature that will let you do the things of the world and back to my point there was no fighting or Waring in your members right right but now that you're born again or even if you just be justified you've come to a Consciousness right that something's wrong that's right and even in your justification and sanctification you may still reach for the beer because in justification you still got the old nature everybody understand that I want everybody to understand this this is this is what we teach in this church that justification only chops off your past sins that's right you're still a sinner amen now some way by Grace if you're if you die during that time God's going to give you eternal life I believe that because you've been Justified your sins have been forgiven if you die then you go to heaven but you don't come up in the bride you don't come up in the resurrection you got to go to the white Throne cuz your sins have to be judged there amen but now you're born again today if you're born again filled with the Holy Ghost you've got everything you need it's all done and finished that's right but let me finish that statement we're not that way out here that's right that's why we need that that's right exactly right see that's what the seals have given us an opportunity to do it's not only to to to have these virtues working in our life but the absolute love of God the love of God was before the foundation of the world he had children that's the love of God the love of God if you you got to have something to love right that's true right that's right so when you were out in the world and you love the things of the world it didn't bother you to get up and put a cigarette in your mouth and light it I mean it just wasn't common nature for me to just reach and get a a pouch of tobacco and stick it in my mouth you know or I'd get condemned when Daddy and Mama come by you know they like that thing out but that was the condemnation why because the Holy Ghost was in them condemning me right right you sisters put on a pair of pants if you wore pants some of you never have but if you put on a pair of pants back in the world did you get up in the morning and go I shouldn't do this no no you just put them on you just put them on you just War that's right didn't think about it that's right but when you come to a Consciousness that that was wrong even though you were may be justified and you still put them on there was that little bit of a little click that said you should do that that's right but now you can still overr in justification and put them suckers on go right out the door never bother never bother you a bit that's right but now when you come to sanctification all that stuff needs to start going out okay sanctification cleans you up and puts you in ready for service not in service but ready for service all right ready for service not in you're not filled with the Holy Ghost then that's right all right right but you should start getting a better consciousness of the things that hey I need to go to church right I need to read my Bible I need to be around a different group of people cuz brother R said he gives you a new Spirit at sanctification that you can even tolerate your own old self cuz you got a lot of the old self still there true okay that's right and even when the Holy Ghost comes listen you can go through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost in 2 minutes or you can take two years or you can take 10 years it doesn't matter but the Bible says those who is Justified he already glorified so if he just if he truly Justified you he knows you're going to go on now you don't I don't the preacher may not know but he knows you're going to go on okay so that's to me if you stop if you stop anywhere in your in your in your Christian experience if you say I got a doubt go back to that justification and say God forgive me of my past sins I don't ever want to do them again and then change do something different you know brother R made a statement one time I get to preach and and quit doing Sunday school amen but brother BR said one time he said if you are stingy don't go pray and fast no he he said just start giving stuff away he said do the vice versa you're like man that's just too easy that's the problem it's too easy if you're stingy he said give you money away in other words so if you're if you're if you're this you said well I'm I I don't go to church to church okay car going to church why don't read my Bible start reading your Bible Well I watch too much television throw it out or at least unplug it we got to remember we got to tithe our time God wants our time more than he does our money he wants our time more than he wants our money that's the thing that this man right here has given us he's given us less and less time because now everything so instant Y come up out of that thing the other night you know coming from camping and all and soon as you hit where you can get Sal service your phone starts going ding ding ding ding ding ding ding you got emails right and left well you know what that takes up your time God wants your time more than your more than your money God don't need your money but he needs your time that's right all right so this man right here and this I wrote the beginning of death and that's what it is this is the beginning of death because this is where Satan is coming he ascended watch what he done then we look at him but now let's go to Second Thessalonians we read it but let's read it again and let's see what that man comes to you see nobody's been able verse two or chapter 2 nobody's ever been able to understand the devil until now simply because he fed everybody during the ages the father Son and Holy Ghost baptism right right God winked at that ignorance people were saved and Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost under that but see that couldn't get that couldn't get their body change they could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and may even believe in a trinity that to us that would be we couldn't do that in this age you can't believe a trinity and be born again once you seen the light that's true that you're in now that's right you can't do that that's right no way no that's right no way you can't take three Gods that's true you can't take three Gods you can't believe in a trinity and be born again right I just don't believe that I you can't cuz who you getting born again by that's right the Father the Son or the Holy Ghost one of which one which one amen but we realize the father Son and Holy Ghost is the same person brother BR said that person person comes to you at the new birth and burst you into the body that's that one person so so now we got people that that you know Catholics pray to the father and and he takes it to the or I mean to the Holy Ghost and they take it to the Sun see Satan just got them all pulled apart it's true but we come under the understanding of the message of the hour there's no other way you can receive the true the true Holy Ghost and that doesn't mean one was false true because in Revelations it says the faithful and true witness talking about Jesus Christ brother Ry said that's not true like in it was false it's like in your SE being the full like remember I was saying before you know like thish last Sunday you know that doesn't do away with the room but this is all you can see well believe in what you see true and that's what theyve done during the ages they believe in what they believed in what they saw yes right but Satan was still working through all that you know why cuz there was not a son of God took a body change under that see if Satan can defeat us and keep us dying and going by the grave he can't bring the the Saints can't come back to this earth right scripture says one scripture keeps them from coming back Paul said we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those who are asleep now that scripture holds them from coming back just because an end of time or God's finished or the last one comes in even when the last one comes in people we got to take a body change to get them people here that's right God's got to be standing on just like he was at the resurrection to call those people out of the ground cuz he said I am the resurrection and the life so there's not any other so he's got to be standing on the earth not him physically right cuz his body doesn't come back till the Millennium but we are his body if Satan can do this right here you and I should be more than able to do the other that's read this before we go up verse three let no man deceive you by any means which that happen see Paul's telling them don't let no man deceive you but they have deceive to S to Believe In Father Son Holy Ghost no eternal hell I mean eternal hell and all those things that's why brother BR come back to TI the loose end bring them back to Paul and then preach his message which is to tell you that you didn't sin in the first place but you got to realize that you can't just walk up to Satan and say I didn't do that he's going to go yeah you did and I'm going to prove you did cuz I'm make you do it again but with god with God on the scene see the day of Christ is at hand which is here let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come what the day of Christ what is the day of Christ I believe it's the day when Revelation 10:7 when that when Christ came down in that Mighty angel came down on the earth and and went through brother brandham and and spoke through him because it's the voice spoke through him to me and you so Christ is here he's not coming there's not a uh the Rapture is already in progress and he's here now okay but there's a physical coming but this is his coming right here right in the group of people except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed all right that's the guy back over that we just read about that wanted to be like God this guy don't be want to be like God now in second Thessalonians to be like God is Antichrist he wants to be God all right who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God now that don't sound like that powerless guy back over y this is the guy that's exalting himself and making himself God or that is worshiped so that he as God not like God as God that's one of them little bitty words as and if all that as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God God he's moved from Isaiah looking at a at a at a man that was just powerless and a bluff and nothing to him and we walked by and you know it'd be like this for just an example it'd be like us we never saw this man just just think in your mind we never saw this powerful guy say say it's a president of the United States but we never saw him he he's he's this something we hear about but we never see his picture and he's just got this grip on all of us and but where is he getting his power through the people that he gets in their mind and says hey this man is powerful this man this and we just go about our time and we got this great ruler over us and he's mean and and exalted and arrogant and and makes us do things that we don't want to do and then somewhere we get an understanding and can look through the veil or through the White House in other words walk in the White House and you see this swiveled up about 100 50 year old man that can't get out of a chair can't even talk drooling all over himself and you say is that the man is that the man that made all the nations bow to his feet somebody say yeah that's that's that's the guy that's right now what would that make you and I feel like oh man we feel stupid right well that's what we look got to do with Satan we got to see that that's what he is you say oh no he no he's not he's not he's powerless unless you and I give him the power that's true that's why that first seal is so important because the first seal saw a separation from a prophet here stands the Lamb with a book in his hand and there rides off the White Horse Rider riding away from his Revelation brother Bram had a revelation of who God was one true and living God and Jesus was his name and that man was he said if you got two he said one's God cuz there's only one God that's right he said there's one God he said if there two people he said one of them must be the devil same thing with you and I if you got a good thought and a bad thought like the white dog black dog see now let me finish this one time now that we are born again now see that's where the War Began yes all you need to really smoke that cigarette all you need boy look that pretty girl over there boy look that what sure back beer she looks good you know that old that old you is still there right that old thinking mentality I wish I could forget all the things that I did but Satan make sure you don't but you know what those are just thoughts that's true that's the man of sin that's the power that we are giving him because we set and dwell on it right let's just realize one thing we're not worth anything that's right none of us there's no big eyes and little you that's right the only thing that that that I have is a little gift to be able to talk to you and and what I do is is throw out words that's true right sister John I throw out words right that's like sister Johnny said last Sunday she you know she wanted me to draw that big thing that I did about the new birth and how you made them she said I got to realize I got to understand that not let somebody else do it for me not in other words not somebody draw it up and hand it to me well that's what people been doing with quotes they say here I got a quote for this I got a quote for this I got a quote for that this must disappear right into here right once this is Brother B said as long as it's on the pages see if it's on the pages it's got to come from Pages through your what Your Eyes which are part of your body which is fallen and then it's got to go where into the Battleground Satan is in here too the Battleground then you either are able to kick it out and let it go down 16 more in or you sit here and dwell on it and don't let it get to your heart that's you stop up the flu that's right read the greatest battle ever fought brother talking about flu getting stopped up well that's what happens right here with the Statue of perfect man I like to turn I'd got to turn these up this way and have faith going up this way and what happens with us we pack that flu with junk and let the faith just go to right here let the knowledge just go to right here Temperance go to right here patience go to and what we keep it suppressed right right but as the word opens up and as we see more and more what God has for us already here then all we got to do is say hey satan even though you may destroy this body job said in my flesh I shall see God so Satan you may drop you may drop an a bomb on me but not a literal one but I'm talking about his bomb which is unbelief right and may go by the grave but guess what we don't ever live we never live that first shield shows me one thing we don't lose right we don't lose when we see him riding off that means he has no power if you see something riding away from you is he going to harm you if he's riding away from you he can't harm you when he's going in that direction cuz there's not one coming from this direction right you got that lonox man and Eagle protecting the temple right lonox man and Eagle we'll read it in Ezekiel that's what we're coming to we read it in Ezekiel where that Lineo man and Eagle everywhere brother R said every time you need them they turn in that direction and he said they're always going forward so if Satan is riding off and you can see him that's the Revelation you and I have to see that Satan has rode away from your Revelation and you can understand his tactics we're a whole lot closer to home whole lot closer let's go
