[7:57] from Ephesians 1
[8:00] and then we'll go to Second Peter 1
[8:04] Ephesians 1 2 Peter one now remember the
[8:10] uh announcements has been made and
[8:12] everything but the viewing for brother
[8:14] Tom will be um
[8:17] tomorrow at uh there in Ryon that it
[8:23] it'll be
[8:25] uh CR funeral home and remember between
[8:29] 6 8:00 tomorrow and then the funeral
[8:31] will be Friday at 12: and uh you know we
[8:35] really we really will miss brother Tom
[8:38] but uh you know we understand too that
[8:43] some of us are going to go on and go by
[8:45] the grave and that's no embarrassment
[8:46] it's a wonderful thing that's right cuz
[8:48] he told Brother Don Donnie there he said
[8:51] there I believe it was Monday he said
[8:53] I'm just about 20 ft right over
[8:56] there that was you know he was looking
[8:59] and and seeing things different so we
[9:01] appreciate it and uh so we just you know
[9:05] we'll have a a few moments of Silent
[9:07] prayer in just a moment when we get
[9:08] through uh with the announcements but
[9:11] remember that and remember the
[9:13] fellowship meeting starting Saturday
[9:16] 3:30 and then we will have brother for
[9:18] there with us and he'll be with us for
[9:20] the weekend so we're asking if you will
[9:24] to everybody in in your seat and area if
[9:27] you will clean up a little bit it would
[9:29] help you know take up the books the
[9:31] extra papers the the things you've got
[9:34] with you uh try to clean up a little bit
[9:36] in your area uh cuz you probably won't
[9:39] be sitting there so somebody else is
[9:41] going to see what you've left so kind of
[9:44] clean up and you know and that way we
[9:46] won't have to write a name and put on it
[9:48] you know and say brother klie sit here
[9:51] you know but just just try to clean up a
[9:54] little bit and that'll help June and
[9:55] everything in doing for the for the
[9:57] meeting but we we really looking forward
[9:59] to the weekend that's right you know
[10:02] so Ephesians 1 and 2 Peter let's just
[10:05] have a few moments of Silent prayer just
[10:08] in honor of brother Tom and uh because
[10:12] we do we appreciate him 20 something
[10:15] years they've been here I think that's
[10:17] right it's on going on up towards 30 but
[10:19] I know it's about 84 wasn't it somewhere
[10:22] around 84 so that would be what about 27
[10:25] I guess something and but we we really
[10:29] you you know appreciate all the years
[10:30] that we've had with him and it's like he
[10:33] said he said uh you know he and I would
[10:36] spend sometimes he had a good job and he
[10:38] could come over and we have talked as
[10:41] much as probably 6 hours out of eight
[10:44] you know just walking up and down the
[10:46] line with me there and and everything
[10:48] and Hauling my breakfast cuz that was
[10:50] the one thing everybody laughed about
[10:52] that he had the only uh Hollow in the
[10:55] plant that was a diesel because he of
[10:57] the job he had to do and and that they
[10:59] called it the six ton Hollow said there
[11:01] comes your breakfast it's taking a six
[11:03] ton Hollow to ha your breakfast and he
[11:06] bring down breakfast every morning and
[11:08] you know and then he'd go do his job and
[11:10] come back and we'd Fellowship together
[11:12] so he said one day he said brother Dale
[11:13] he said talk to these other people
[11:15] around here he said cuz me and you've
[11:17] had our day we've had our time of
[11:19] talking and you know and that was that
[11:21] was good you know and we did so the Lord
[11:24] Lord blesses and takes care we just
[11:26] appreciate it so let's just have a few
[11:28] moments of solid prayer before we go
[11:31] through the rest of the service in honor
[11:33] of of brother Tom he passed away this
[11:36] morning somewhere right about 4:30 so
[11:40] just remember that I got up at 4:24 and
[11:43] started that way were there yesterday
[11:46] but came on home and then started that
[11:48] away and got there and found out he
[11:50] passed on but uh you know that was that
[11:52] was all right that was you know I'd love
[11:55] to been sitting our side of him but
[11:57] that's still all right we he's not too
[11:59] far away that's right not too far away
[12:02] today so that's the point let's just
[12:03] have a few moments of Silent prayer
[12:06] before we go with a service just in
[12:08] honor of the time that we've had with
[12:10] our brother okay
[12:29] father we ask you to just be with the
[12:32] fish family Lord now in the time of our
[12:35] brother passing and just make everybody
[12:38] to realize that you know there's a
[12:40] better place and uh we want to go that
[12:43] way Lord and
[12:45] uh if I could have anything that I'd
[12:48] like to have of his would I'd like to
[12:51] have his eternal life right now where
[12:53] he's dwelling at cuz that would be a
[12:55] wonderful opportunity we thank you cuz
[12:58] you made all things possible so just be
[13:00] comfort in the hearts to each one Lord
[13:02] and bless and guide and take care of
[13:05] everybody Lord and we ask you now to be
[13:07] with us tonight as we speak about you
[13:08] from your word that you would come on
[13:10] the scene and and speak to our hearts
[13:12] and Lord just give us what You' have for
[13:16] us this night we love you and we thank
[13:18] you we commit it all to you now in Jesus
[13:21] name
[13:27] amen Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the
[13:31] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[13:33] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[13:35] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[13:39] according as he has chosen Us in him
[13:41] before the foundation of the world that
[13:42] we should be holy and Without Blame
[13:44] before him in love having predestinated
[13:47] us unto the adoption of children by
[13:50] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[13:53] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[13:55] of the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[13:58] made us accept
[13:59] in the Beloved I turn over to Second
[14:03] Peter CU this is going to just be the
[14:05] thought we'll be using tonight with this
[14:07] on adoption in three stages uh this is
[14:10] message number six and
[14:13] uh but I want you to think about
[14:15] something that that that Peter says here
[14:18] and look at verse chapter 1 starting
[14:21] verse
[14:22] 10 wherefore the rather Brethren give
[14:25] diligence to make your calling and
[14:27] election sure
[14:30] for if you do these things you shall
[14:32] never
[14:33] fall why for an entrance shall be
[14:36] ministered unto you abundantly and to
[14:38] the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[14:41] Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not
[14:44] be negligent to put you always reme in
[14:47] remembrance of these things though you
[14:50] know them and be established in the
[14:53] present truth that's you may be seated
[14:56] the Lord add his Blessing to the word
[14:58] and and we'll be you'll see what I mean
[15:00] in a minute cuz we're going to be
[15:01] talking about uh this adoption but we're
[15:05] going to talk about present truth I told
[15:07] you Sunday that what we'd try to do
[15:09] tonight is just look through the Bible
[15:11] and the prophet's message and and try to
[15:14] see some promises that are for
[15:17] specifically for us you know it's good
[15:21] when the Bible says by Stripes I'm
[15:24] Healed now that's that's for everybody
[15:27] right that that's for everybody all
[15:30] right now but when it comes on down to
[15:34] where you're
[15:35] at see and and it says something like uh
[15:40] you know and that'll be one of the
[15:41] scriptures we'll get to in a minute in
[15:43] Malachi it says behold I send
[15:47] you Elijah the prophet AR you remember
[15:51] was it sister mey that you know was
[15:54] wondering about Mary and brother
[15:55] brandham you know and the Lord spoke to
[15:57] her on that scripture behold I send you
[16:00] Elijah the prophet all right but there
[16:02] are things that are specific and
[16:05] straight to you and I right and that's
[16:08] what I want us to talk about you know we
[16:10] as I said uh other
[16:12] things you read the Bible and and you
[16:15] can relate with the brothers and sisters
[16:17] down through time that have lived those
[16:19] days and and all like that and but yet
[16:23] we are in an age and a time to to bring
[16:27] all things to an end
[16:29] and to finish up and there's a lot of
[16:31] scriptures and and a lot of things
[16:33] pointing specifically down to where we
[16:36] are and if you remember back not too
[16:38] long ago I was preaching about the the
[16:41] the bride's book and I said if the if
[16:43] you want to see your your part of the
[16:46] Bible read the book of
[16:48] Revelation because that shows you the
[16:51] bride's part you know there the book
[16:53] specifically speaking to us and I was
[16:56] thinking coming up the road I thought
[16:59] what scripture would I use to and I
[17:01] don't know where will or not I thought
[17:04] what scripture would I use to preach
[17:06] brother Tom's funeral and I thought well
[17:11] I guess the best one would be related to
[17:13] him would be Revelation
[17:18] 61 about the seals cuz that was what he
[17:21] always tried to get everybody to see was
[17:24] the SE I don't know where I use it or
[17:26] not but I doing and I was looking as a
[17:28] coming up to there and I saw a big
[17:30] billboard it had VAB Ruth on it you know
[17:33] and it says that he went from a
[17:37] orphanage to uh what is it inducted into
[17:41] the Hall of Fame and I thought Lord you
[17:44] know well brother Tom started in an
[17:46] orphanage but he ain't worried about a
[17:48] Hall of Fame cuz he's in heaven now so
[17:51] that's that's a good point all right but
[17:53] let's get on with it now we've been
[17:55] trying to bring out as I said about
[17:57] adoption in three
[17:59] stages and we covered it took us quite a
[18:02] little bit we covered the uh the new
[18:05] birth because we must be born again we
[18:08] must come into the family of God and you
[18:11] know and then when we're born again then
[18:14] we can start a growth development and
[18:17] things into uh coming up through the
[18:20] stature of perfect man Etc and uh you
[18:23] know we can can come out to a place that
[18:25] the Bible speaks of of the manifestation
[18:28] of the sons of God all right then we
[18:31] gave you there uh this past Wednesday uh
[18:35] the quotes and I gave you know some back
[18:37] to you where brother Brandon was talking
[18:39] about manifestation he said what is
[18:41] manifestation he was talking about
[18:42] manifested sons of God uh
[18:45] 1960 uh
[18:46] 518 and he's he's talking about Earnest
[18:49] expectation the whole creation is
[18:51] waiting for the manifestation see the
[18:53] manifestation what is the manifestation
[18:56] making
[18:57] known right see basically everybody
[19:00] deals with manifestation as signs and
[19:03] wonders but I went outside there uh
[19:06] Sunday afternoon after speaking a while
[19:09] about it and people were coming up
[19:10] relating their own thoughts back to me
[19:13] you know and uh you know the word
[19:18] manifest is to make known we used to we
[19:20] had to go by manifest at work see that
[19:23] was what kept us in order and you doing
[19:25] your jobs and everything you know you've
[19:28] got a manifest Fest you've got a paper
[19:30] where it's not the work it's a paper to
[19:33] show you what is being done well see
[19:35] that's to me what I tried to get you to
[19:37] see that if we make God
[19:41] known right by speaking about him from
[19:44] his word and and trying to show him to
[19:47] the people then he'll make us known with
[19:49] signs and wonders so that's that's all
[19:51] I've ever tried to do is just just to
[19:53] speak about you know the things that God
[19:56] has made known to me and then I try to
[19:59] make them known to you I I want you to
[20:01] see my father that's the the one thing
[20:04] you know that I want you to see I want
[20:06] you to see my father because that way
[20:08] then he'll become your father and you
[20:11] know and we all have the same father but
[20:14] that's the point I want you to see and
[20:16] and I'm sorry to say but that's why that
[20:19] a lot of people are not seeing signs and
[20:21] wonders and they're questioning and
[20:23] they're saying well you know uh why is
[20:26] it not that things are taking place and
[20:28] we've been around here all of these
[20:30] years and and all of this that and the
[20:32] other well could it be that they haven't
[20:35] seed the word down in the hearts of the
[20:37] people you know I don't want to be so
[20:39] hard about that but uh you know uh to me
[20:44] if we make him known he can make us
[20:46] known right well maybe that's why that
[20:49] manifestation is not appearing among a
[20:51] lot of people is because they're not
[20:53] making God known right amen and and you
[20:55] know and and he doesn't he's not
[20:57] underbound right he's onon bound to his
[20:59] word though if we make his word known
[21:01] he's onon bound to make us known with
[21:04] the restoration of the word the prophet
[21:05] said we come to Restoration of power see
[21:09] all right he said and he sent his word
[21:11] what and healed us and delivered us from
[21:16] destruction so then it it's in the word
[21:19] see and let's just do that let's try to
[21:21] make the word manifest and then you'll
[21:24] see what he was saying as I gave you
[21:26] these quotes back to you that brother
[21:28] said on the message Shalom 64 he said to
[21:31] manifest to make known to the people the
[21:34] promises that he's made for this
[21:39] day now we're talking about present day
[21:41] truth
[21:43] see and we you know people have lived
[21:45] their time and all that's well and good
[21:49] but we're here wanting to know about
[21:51] present day truth in other words what is
[21:53] it for you and I
[21:55] right and that's what I want you to look
[21:57] at see he he's made he said manifest the
[22:00] light of the day the then when we do
[22:03] that everything will be fine then he
[22:05] goes on talking about how that there's
[22:08] but in this it but this is the day of
[22:10] the manifestation of sons of God this is
[22:13] the position in Christ uh number three
[22:16] coming down on your notes 196 522 the
[22:18] morning service but this is the day of
[22:21] the manifestation of the sons of God
[22:23] when the mystery that's been hid since
[22:26] the foundation of the world is to be
[22:28] made known this is the hour amen sure
[22:32] the all right I believe in miracles and
[22:34] signs and wonders that's what don't
[22:36] misunderstand me please and we can stand
[22:39] here all night long and talk about it
[22:41] and we have told you of the things that
[22:43] God has done among us to the dead raised
[22:46] the sick heel storm spoken out of
[22:48] existence rain called for and it came
[22:51] people that uh needed salvation it has
[22:53] been spoken and and you know there's two
[22:56] sitting here right now that that I told
[22:58] you before before Wade came back I said
[23:00] he'll come you know well then I told Jo
[23:02] one day I said don't worry about Danny I
[23:03] said he's coming well see it was
[23:06] something that that you know that you
[23:08] can see right and and and you know and
[23:11] you don't want to to
[23:14] uh go too far on some of the things but
[23:18] when it happens you know that it's true
[23:20] right and uh so then that way we don't
[23:22] have to worry God has made himself
[23:24] manifest Among Us with signs and wonders
[23:27] but I want more amen I'm not satisfied
[23:30] right we have sickness among us we have
[23:32] heartaches and troubles I want to be for
[23:34] the people to be delivered I want to be
[23:36] delivered myself you know but the main
[23:38] thing I want is to change of this body
[23:41] and I'm really jealous of brother Tom
[23:43] today because see he's there to where I
[23:46] would I want to be you know and and all
[23:49] but you know now he's you know what he's
[23:51] saying how
[23:53] long right you know that's what he's
[23:56] saying how long in other words how long
[23:58] is it don't take you much down there to
[23:59] get into it of what we've been talking
[24:02] about you know and all like that so it's
[24:04] a wonderful wonderful day but now listen
[24:07] let's think about
[24:09] it see about being
[24:13] established in the present day
[24:16] truth in other words what's exactly
[24:19] pointing to you and I right scriptures
[24:23] quotes from The Prophet that are
[24:25] pointing to he not just an over all view
[24:30] you know not just meaning for everybody
[24:33] right but you remember how I tried to
[24:36] bring it that the prophet of God said in
[24:38] the church 's book there that it's not
[24:41] the person that comes predestinated
[24:43] eternally from God that's right we come
[24:46] by for knowledge all right but it's the
[24:49] word are
[24:52] seed so then there was a word or seed
[24:55] and I gave you some quotes on that cuz
[24:57] I've already give them to you before
[24:58] four of where there's a word or seed for
[25:02] each age that's right now the just shall
[25:06] live by faith was a predestinated
[25:10] seed there was no way that was not going
[25:14] to come to pass amen that's right you
[25:17] agree amen I mean there it was it had to
[25:20] come to pass it was in God's word well
[25:22] all right that's what I'm trying to get
[25:23] you to see I want us to see what's in
[25:26] the word for you and me
[25:28] that's predestinated
[25:31] eternally and will take place now if we
[25:34] want to be a part of
[25:36] it see we can make our choice but if we
[25:40] don't want to be a part of it right then
[25:42] you know but I've got one in here
[25:44] somewhere brother around and said and if
[25:46] it's right he said let's go for it in
[25:48] other words he said but if it ain't
[25:51] let's get away from it right you know so
[25:54] that's that's a that's a good way to be
[25:56] all right but see it's the it's the seed
[25:58] or word that comes predestinated
[26:01] eternally amen the other is dealing by
[26:04] for knowledge of word the seed or word
[26:07] will land in each one of us well then I
[26:10] believe and I told you that I believe
[26:13] the scripture is talking about changing
[26:15] moment twinkl an ey I believe somebody
[26:17] is living right now in a body you know
[26:20] human body that's corre that's
[26:23] predestinated that it's going to be
[26:26] changed all right now I believe that
[26:29] right I believe somebody's living in a
[26:31] body and I've contended I'm one of them
[26:34] that's living in a body that's
[26:36] predestinated amen not just by for
[26:38] knowledge now right right but
[26:42] predestinated to be the very and and
[26:44] everybody Paul when he comes up he's
[26:47] going to come up in the body he lived in
[26:49] you know we know that all right but he
[26:52] wasn't see that was under still under
[26:54] the body was dealing with for knowledge
[26:57] but we're in the day when somebody's
[26:59] going to say death you're
[27:02] annihilated walk right into eternal life
[27:05] while we're right here amen not have to
[27:07] go up to heaven somewhere and find it
[27:09] that's right but while we're right here
[27:11] just walk right into it and doing that
[27:13] then wouldn't it be that that's a
[27:15] predestinated seed because that way Time
[27:18] and Eternity meet here Time and Eternity
[27:22] don't meet in heaven right no Time and
[27:25] Eternity meets right here that's right
[27:27] and that's why that that we're in the
[27:29] the Romans era of of and we'll get back
[27:32] to it in a minute you know of saying
[27:34] that the whole world is groaning waiting
[27:36] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[27:38] right all right waiting on them to make
[27:41] God
[27:42] known right and then he'll make them
[27:46] known that's the whole key now you you
[27:49] think I don't believe in signs and
[27:50] wonders you're you're all messed up
[27:53] because I I've seen too much amen you
[27:56] know I've seen too many things you know
[27:58] they not want to believe in in in
[28:01] Miracles right and things cuz that's you
[28:04] know I just believe it but the end of
[28:07] all things according to uh
[28:11] Peter I think it's 1 Peter 4:7 but he's
[28:14] he's talking about like the end of all
[28:17] things all see now when you come to the
[28:20] end of all things the prophet would say
[28:23] he Sav the best the last right that's
[28:26] why it says the last shall be be first
[28:28] and the and the first should be last why
[28:31] because it's all dependent upon the last
[28:35] part all right everything waiting on you
[28:38] and I
[28:40] see and it's the age we're living right
[28:45] amen and we've got to believe it that's
[28:49] right now when you when if you've ever
[28:52] been healed you know what I'm talking
[28:55] about that one minute you're standing
[28:57] there
[28:59] and and you don't
[29:00] know and you're believing and you're
[29:03] trying to as we call it muster up enough
[29:06] Faith to believe but then something just
[29:09] comes down and speaks to you right well
[29:12] it just don't make no difference brother
[29:14] Tom came in one morning down at work
[29:15] we'd always meet in the break area and
[29:17] he came in one morning and he said uh
[29:20] I'm putting uh blood through my my I
[29:23] think it was his vows that time I'm not
[29:25] certain but any I'm putting blood
[29:26] through and he said I'm leaving now
[29:28] going to the hospital and so we just
[29:31] gathered and we prayed well he went to
[29:33] the hospital and stayed over a week and
[29:34] they never did find out what was wrong
[29:35] with it why because God took it away
[29:38] from him you know and and we believe it
[29:41] because that it is God's word am all
[29:44] right now I I'm saying this let's see
[29:47] how was it right around and said on
[29:49] Calvary was in other words the biggest
[29:51] portion of the Old Testament more of the
[29:53] Old Testament was fulfilled in the last
[29:55] few hours somewhere close to that verb
[29:58] eight un quote than there was of the
[29:59] rest of the scriptures amen cuz that's
[30:02] what everything pointed right was to
[30:05] Calvary right all right now I believe
[30:08] everything in the Bible is pointing to
[30:11] you and I
[30:13] am I believe that so then we got a Bible
[30:16] to fulfill right we've got a word to be
[30:19] F fulfilled it's not just going to
[30:21] church and being good and believe the
[30:23] prophet's message and and help the
[30:25] widows and orphans and all that and all
[30:27] that's well and good
[30:29] but to recognize the prophet preached a
[30:32] message called what recognizing your day
[30:35] and its message right all right now to
[30:38] recognize the message is the only way
[30:40] we'll know our day right that's right
[30:42] but he did do he TI there recognizing
[30:45] your day right and its
[30:50] message the message of the day declares
[30:54] where you and I are at right see that
[30:57] but people will say but but it it you
[30:59] know why are we not seeing because we're
[31:02] doubting what God has
[31:05] done we're not taking what God has
[31:08] said and believing
[31:11] it R around said one person get
[31:15] healed he said in order to throw the
[31:17] entire church into
[31:20] desperation right well because word
[31:23] believe it word believe for me right
[31:26] because it's not sent see healing is
[31:29] sent for
[31:30] everybody but there's a word in this age
[31:34] for you and I to fulfill right all right
[31:38] and and and it's the end of all
[31:41] things all right and that's why I wanted
[31:43] to say like present day
[31:46] truth not yesterday's truth that's
[31:49] wonderful but present day today right
[31:54] today is the day of salvation amen
[31:58] and see then that way we can watch it as
[32:01] it unfolds to see our
[32:05] day and what we're seeing through the
[32:09] scriptures right all right that's far
[32:12] this day
[32:14] amen all right now so let's just take a
[32:17] few and and then we'll get a few of what
[32:19] the prophet has to say about it when
[32:21] everybody knows let's just start off
[32:22] with it let's start off with Malachi
[32:24] 4 it's a good place to start amen
[32:29] all
[32:37] right now watch verse
[32:40] two well let's go verse one for Behold a
[32:43] day cometh that shall burn as an oven
[32:44] and all the proud Y and all that do
[32:46] wickedly shall be stoble and and the day
[32:49] that and the day that cometh shall burn
[32:52] them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it
[32:54] shall leave them neither root nor Branch
[32:57] but unto you you see you here over here
[33:02] today now that fear my name shall the
[33:05] son of righteousness arise with healing
[33:07] in his wings now what was that the
[33:11] prophet said that was a Divine Healing
[33:14] campaign
[33:16] right that went
[33:19] out all right now I'll be glad to show
[33:22] you these or we'll sit down with the
[33:23] computer and run them up for you but he
[33:25] said that was the son of righteous ring
[33:28] with healing he said it was a healing
[33:30] campaign well that
[33:32] happened right right see that took place
[33:36] to all mankind believes in it they just
[33:39] like we was talking last night they just
[33:41] don't believe in the the message the man
[33:43] brought they believe in all the signs
[33:44] and wonders all right and watch with
[33:47] healing in his wings and ye me me see
[33:51] shall go forth and grow up as caves of
[33:55] the stall yep all right right the
[33:58] message is going to
[34:00] come you feed calf in the stall stored
[34:05] up food right right y CU you're you're
[34:08] wanting them to fatten up and ye what
[34:11] shall tread down the wicked for they
[34:14] shall be ashes Under The Souls of your
[34:16] feet now each one of these I didn't do
[34:18] it for this message but each one of
[34:20] these I've got a circle around it where
[34:22] it says ye and where it says your feet
[34:27] in the day I shall do this say the Lord
[34:29] of hosts remember
[34:31] ye the law of Moses my servant because
[34:35] all of the word of the Old Testament
[34:40] spoke of the coming of Elijah
[34:43] right you said well no no it's spoke
[34:46] what you you don't get what I'm
[34:48] meaning Elijah to come in here which
[34:51] would be the last one of the Old
[34:53] Testament would be John the Baptist
[34:55] right all right see then every thing was
[34:58] pointing to that right if he didn't come
[35:03] forth then nothing wasn't right before
[35:06] then
[35:07] right true right but if he came forth it
[35:12] meant everything back there was right
[35:15] right all preceding every Prophet had to
[35:17] line up with the next Prophet right
[35:19] everything had to line up together all
[35:21] right so then that's what he's saying
[35:22] Remember You The Law of Moses I wrote
[35:24] this in my Bible all word speaks of
[35:28] 4 all the Old Testament spoke of Malachi
[35:31] 4 then all the New Testament speak of
[35:33] Malachi
[35:36] 45 you know coming on down right
[35:39] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[35:41] which I commanded him in h for all
[35:43] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[35:45] in other words stay with my word and
[35:47] I'll back it up right right God is Not
[35:50] Over the
[35:52] Sea he's not up in heaven was that what
[35:55] Moses said he was trying to get to
[35:57] people to see a present tense God right
[36:00] for themselves not just for him yeah
[36:04] right see that's what all the prophets
[36:06] were
[36:07] doing look behold I will send
[36:10] you
[36:15] amen let's read that this way let's read
[36:17] it together all right behold come on
[36:20] read with me say it with me okay behold
[36:24] I will send you now you're saying that
[36:28] to me and I'm saying it to you right
[36:32] right Elijah the prophet before the
[36:35] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[36:37] the Lord that's a promise in the Bible
[36:39] then now they coming before the great
[36:42] and Dreadful
[36:46] day that's not John the Baptist right so
[36:50] that was promised to be in end time
[36:52] right amen all right now was there any
[36:55] way to stop that now you know the devil
[36:58] done everything he
[36:59] could to try to do it now we can go on
[37:02] with what to turn the hearts of the CH
[37:03] for the fathers of the children hearts
[37:05] of the children to their fathers showing
[37:08] what would happen and coming down but
[37:11] it's pointing down to this day right
[37:15] right right amen that's speaking of this
[37:18] day that we could say with each one of
[37:20] these scriptures this day this scripture
[37:24] is fulfilled now we have had the message
[37:27] of the hour
[37:29] right we've had the prophet to come and
[37:32] bring us the message right amen so now
[37:35] what is
[37:38] it it's left up to the people to take
[37:42] the message amen and to make the message
[37:45] alive in a group of people right all
[37:49] right so that's the present day
[37:52] truth yeah are you with me now let's go
[37:56] over then everybody know scripture but
[37:58] let's go over in 1
[38:01] Thessalonians everybody knows the
[38:03] scriptures we're using but let's just
[38:05] let's just read them
[38:07] see and think about ourselves
[38:14] right 1
[38:18] Thessalonians
[38:20] 4 verse
[38:23] 15 now watch this is pointing here you
[38:27] understand my point is reading
[38:28] scriptures it points to this day right
[38:32] all right not another day now CU we
[38:35] believe
[38:37] that but to recognize your day and its
[38:40] message we recognize the message but
[38:43] what about the
[38:45] day all right for this we say unto you
[38:50] who
[38:51] now by the word of the Lord that we
[38:55] which are alive and remain un the coming
[38:57] of the Lord shall not prevent them which
[38:59] are asleep now Paul was prophesying
[39:02] right because Paul is not
[39:07] here but he was speaking it as far as he
[39:10] saw it it was
[39:12] there but he was pointing down you
[39:15] remember right the book of Hebrews he
[39:17] was trying his best to get out of the
[39:19] people that God was coming right
[39:24] then and that's what we ought to realize
[39:26] what he said see and we which are alive
[39:29] and remain now he's not
[39:31] here so that's a
[39:34] prophecy speaking of someone that will
[39:38] come and make that manifest y all
[39:44] right since for the Lord himself shall
[39:46] descend from heaven with a shout what is
[39:48] that the message
[39:51] right is that the way the prophet
[39:53] explained it the shouts the message have
[39:56] we had the message
[39:58] amen so we've had the message all right
[40:01] to shout with the voice of the Archangel
[40:04] and he said the same loud voice that
[40:06] raised Lazarus from the dead will speak
[40:08] again in the end time amen where
[40:12] from
[40:14] y he
[40:17] right come
[40:20] on with the Trump of God and the dead in
[40:22] Christ shall
[40:23] rise first then we which are alive and
[40:27] remain shall be caught up together with
[40:29] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[40:31] the air so shall we ever be with the
[40:33] Lord all right now Paul didn't fulfill
[40:36] that
[40:38] right but somebody will
[40:41] amen somebody will do
[40:44] it let's go I got one here I jumped over
[40:47] but excuse me let's go back to Matthew
[40:49] Matthew
[40:52] 24 Matthew 24 is a
[40:55] great great course all them great great
[40:58] but you know where you get Matthew
[41:01] 24 but look at
[41:08] 24:14 this is under the fifth seal right
[41:12] and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be
[41:15] preached in all the world now I know
[41:19] what brother brand said in the days of
[41:21] Paul and him and the gospel was preached
[41:23] to the whole world right right I know
[41:27] that and see so don't just say well now
[41:29] you just don't understand that's done
[41:30] been done now but it's got to be done
[41:35] here and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[41:37] shall be preached in all the world for a
[41:39] witness unto all nations and then shall
[41:42] the End come we stopped to get a about
[41:45] deter today and this girl she said
[41:47] fixing the thing and she said uh you're
[41:49] a preacher aren't you and I yes
[41:51] ma'am she said
[41:55] uh you believe the world's going to end
[41:57] end
[41:59] tomorrow she said they're saying it's
[42:01] going to end
[42:03] tomorrow I said no ma'am you don't have
[42:05] to worry about the world ending
[42:09] tomorrow cuz I didn't have time to
[42:11] explain there got to be three and a half
[42:13] years after the Rapture and I'm still
[42:14] here so that you know I mean I didn't
[42:18] want to go into all that but I just said
[42:20] no ma'am the world's not going to end
[42:23] tomorrow I said they're saying all this
[42:25] at the calendar what it is the Mayan or
[42:28] what something calendar only went to
[42:31] 2012 so they figured it's all over with
[42:34] but I
[42:35] said there's one thing about it though
[42:38] there will be a
[42:40] date when it will come to an end
[42:45] right there will be a day so there'll be
[42:49] a day that that's fulfilled right amen
[42:52] well that day can't be fulfilled now
[42:54] that's right see somebody tells you I
[42:56] got a thing and I wasn't supposed to
[42:58] open it he wrote on it not to open it
[43:00] till May the 25th but I didn't hear
[43:03] anyway but this this brother up in
[43:07] Canada he sent me a message before and
[43:10] he said if I'm a Believer I'll really
[43:12] attach on to this and tell my people
[43:13] about it well I'm going to tell you then
[43:16] what he
[43:20] said he says that the redemption's over
[43:25] nobody can be saved anymore it's all
[43:26] finished fin the seed planting is done
[43:28] we're in the time of the end Gathering
[43:30] of the Harvest and you know coming up in
[43:32] what is it October long in there is the
[43:35] Feast of the end Gatherings etc etc you
[43:37] know whatever but anyhow I don't
[43:39] remember the exact date maybe my wife
[43:41] can tell me but he he put in there that
[43:44] they're going to have these meetings and
[43:46] he said the dead is already started or
[43:49] begins to appear Among Us and they're
[43:51] going to cause great Mass confusion
[43:53] because they're gather you know
[43:55] appearing around the world and
[43:58] everything and he said now make sure you
[44:00] come to this meeting in Canada because
[44:02] that's the end
[44:04] Gathering I assumed that he meant that
[44:07] must be the going away because if the
[44:08] Dead's already raised and and everything
[44:11] so he told me to tell you so now if you
[44:13] want to get the paperwork I'll give it
[44:15] to you and you can go to Canada and and
[44:19] I mean Washington excuse me Washington
[44:21] not Canada he's from Canada but he is
[44:24] Washington is supposed to appear but
[44:26] anyhow so I told you about it you can't
[44:28] argu about that point but I'm not
[44:31] packing up I don't know what you going
[44:32] to do but I'm just going to kind of bite
[44:35] it out and just you know believe and and
[44:38] all like that because you know I'm not
[44:40] concerned because if the dead raises
[44:42] it's going to be among us and I ain't
[44:44] going to be worried about it because I'm
[44:46] I'm going to be established in the
[44:47] present day
[44:48] truth see all these predictions etc etc
[44:52] he did say he said if it don't come to
[44:54] pass said you'll know it
[44:59] well that's a good point we know but
[45:02] anyhow am I'm not making Li of the
[45:05] person cuz you know they get those
[45:07] things in their mind and they get all of
[45:09] this and that and the other but that's
[45:11] what I said a moment ago instead of
[45:13] taking the word and settling down and
[45:15] trying to preach the word to the people
[45:18] Sunday after Sunday week after week year
[45:20] after year they just run with this and
[45:22] run with that they got a whole lot more
[45:24] following you know because everybody
[45:26] wants little things you know to to do
[45:29] something you know they want to to do
[45:31] it's like how if I have probably told
[45:32] that girl I said yep world's going to
[45:34] end tomorrow you better be in church
[45:36] tonight over here with us you know well
[45:40] she might have come but I didn't intend
[45:42] to encourage her or discourage her but
[45:45] now listen let's get off that I'm trying
[45:48] to talk about something present tense
[45:50] all right let's go to um but while
[45:54] you're there have you ever now we read
[45:56] let me let me say this I'm trying to do
[45:58] present day we read Thessalonians right
[46:03] all right we read that scripture and we
[46:05] read it we're called up to meet the
[46:07] Comfort one another with these words but
[46:09] have you ever read the fifth
[46:14] chapter let's just keep reading that
[46:17] to 5th chapter verse
[46:20] one but of the
[46:22] times and the seasons
[46:25] brother you you have no need that I
[46:28] write unto
[46:29] you other words he trying to get it out
[46:31] of their mind it's going to take place
[46:33] back
[46:34] there
[46:36] right for yourselves know perfectly that
[46:39] the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief
[46:42] in the
[46:43] night for when they shall say peace and
[46:47] safety isn't that around the world today
[46:50] oh everything's okay
[46:53] yeah then sudden destruction cometh upon
[46:56] them
[46:57] travail upon them as travail upon a
[47:00] woman with child they shall not Escape
[47:03] but ye Brethren are not in darkness and
[47:06] listen that that day should overtake you
[47:09] as a thief right you're supposed to be
[47:14] programmed you know in the gospel right
[47:19] right you're Children Of Darkness oh I
[47:22] didn't read that right did I children of
[47:24] light and the children of the day we are
[47:27] not of the night nor of Darkness
[47:32] therefore let us not sleep as others do
[47:35] but let us watch and be sober for they
[47:38] that sleep sleep in the night and they
[47:39] that be drunken are drunken in the
[47:43] night but let us who are of the day be
[47:47] sober putting on the breastplate of
[47:49] faith and love and for all for and
[47:53] helmet the hope of salvation
[47:56] [Music]
[47:58] see we read the fourth chapter but we
[48:00] don't read on down that he's telling us
[48:03] it's not going to be here it's going to
[48:06] be in the end
[48:09] time see we're in the end time you you
[48:12] we everbody everybody said that until of
[48:14] course you go up there people you know
[48:16] you know what I mean you do it you you
[48:17] talk to somebody and they say oh the end
[48:19] of the world's coming like i' said to
[48:21] that girl if i' said to her you know
[48:23] yeah that's right end of the world here
[48:25] yeah it is you know what she' probably
[48:27] say it now nobody knows the day and or
[48:30] the hour see they believe it until you
[48:33] telling them it's coming now they wanted
[48:36] about 40 years down the road that would
[48:39] make me
[48:41] 111 so I don't have to worry about it
[48:45] right everybody wants to put it off but
[48:47] see I'm talking about something now look
[48:49] in first
[48:50] Corinthians that's a scripture we all
[48:53] use First Corinthians
[49:00] 15 if I can get my Bible to
[49:09] cooperate
[49:11] 51 but I show you a
[49:14] mystery we shall not all
[49:17] sleep but we shall all be
[49:20] changed again Paul is putting it like
[49:25] it's going to be a his time because he's
[49:27] using the phrase
[49:29] We but he he's saying it's not going to
[49:33] be in a moment in the twinkling of an
[49:36] eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[49:38] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[49:41] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[49:43] for this corruptable must put on
[49:45] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[49:47] immortality then is brought to P the
[49:50] saying death where you stay grave where
[49:52] you Victory all right now that has not
[49:55] taken place right right right amen
[50:00] now see even if the dead appeared Among
[50:03] Us right
[50:05] now we've not all
[50:08] changed so there's things pointing to
[50:12] specific dates and times that will be
[50:15] dates and times then we're not supposed
[50:17] to be worried about it but it will be a
[50:19] certain date or time it we just don't
[50:22] we're just not concerned see because
[50:24] we're not concerned with dates and
[50:26] things
[50:27] but we're concerned with the scriptures
[50:29] being
[50:30] fulfilled right see that scripture is
[50:32] speaking to you and I that that's for
[50:35] us right we got to fulfill this
[50:40] scripture all
[50:42] right and if we don't fulfill this
[50:45] scripture see the dead can't
[50:48] raage
[50:50] right right that's right man if we don't
[50:53] fulfill the the scriptures of
[50:55] Thessalonians coming over with a shout
[50:57] and the voice this scripture can't be
[51:00] made manifest that's right and even if
[51:03] we fulfill do you understand what I'm
[51:06] saying if we fulfill Thessalonians and
[51:09] realize the
[51:10] shout and and the dead would
[51:13] raise we still got to be we would still
[51:17] have a frame of time dealing with to the
[51:20] point that we wouldn't be
[51:23] changed because the dead in Christ
[51:25] should rise and then will be changed
[51:28] right see that's why you say to me
[51:30] brother there when you you think the end
[51:32] of the world's coming no it can't come
[51:33] for 3 and 1/2
[51:36] years you sure yeah why because it's 3
[51:40] and 1/2 years after the
[51:41] Rapture and we're still
[51:44] here right well we not not be going well
[51:47] you go ahead and doubt all you want to
[51:50] you know cuz I believe I know what it is
[51:53] you know the change in the things all
[51:56] right and and and that's what I'm just
[51:57] saying see so it don't bother me
[52:00] predictions the girl she said when I
[52:02] first heard that I just
[52:04] scared well you know where you at you're
[52:06] not
[52:07] scared I ain't worried about it see all
[52:10] right but now get to Point see
[52:13] scriptures pointing to where we're at
[52:16] now we're back into
[52:18] Romans
[52:21] 8 right to see what the world is waiting
[52:26] for are
[52:28] right to see what is related to all of
[52:31] these Chang in a moment twinkle and eye
[52:33] Lord descending from heaven with a shout
[52:35] voice of Archangel trumpet Etc all of
[52:37] that is dependent
[52:40] upon
[52:43] somebody and recognizing who they are
[52:47] right right right because that's what
[52:50] Paul
[52:52] said Paul said here in Romans what verse
[52:56] 19 18 19 for Discerning expectation of
[52:59] the creature or the whole Creation in
[53:01] other world waiteth for what the
[53:03] manifestation of the sons of
[53:07] God for the creature was made subject to
[53:10] vanity in other words he would put down
[53:11] under all of this problem not willingly
[53:14] not of his own in other words but by
[53:16] reason of him who has subjected the same
[53:18] in Hope because the creation itself also
[53:20] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[53:22] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[53:23] the children of God one of these days
[53:25] all of this is going to be changed right
[53:26] right right for we know that the whole
[53:28] creation groan and tril Us in pain
[53:30] together until now groaning waiting for
[53:33] the manifestation of the sons of
[53:36] God so what is the what is dependent
[53:39] what is it all dependent
[53:44] upon see a fulfillment of
[53:48] scripture
[53:50] right it's dependent upon you and I amen
[53:56] all we believe that we are the children
[53:58] of God don't we that's right we believe
[54:01] we're the Sons and Daughters of the
[54:02] Living God well then the whole world is
[54:05] waiting on you and I to recognize who we
[54:09] are and to step out on it and and quit
[54:12] playing
[54:14] around you know we were talking about
[54:17] this last night then it the my brother
[54:19] Tom was laying there and and I remember
[54:23] somebody said well you know
[54:27] he ain't saying nothing but he's
[54:30] listening and he's saying come on you
[54:33] know come
[54:34] on cuz we talking about what he love to
[54:37] talk about you they around brother Tom
[54:39] very long you're going to hear something
[54:41] about Daniel 70 weeks or the seals or
[54:43] something right we may have not agreed
[54:46] with his approach to go out to the world
[54:50] and just grab somebody in a a waffle
[54:54] house and set them down and buy them a
[54:57] dinner and talk to them for as long as
[54:59] they'll sit there about the seals we
[55:02] might not agreed with that but there's
[55:04] one thing about it what was we
[55:07] doing oh we're so spiritual we don't do
[55:10] it like that where was we
[55:15] at oh changes things
[55:19] don't not turn off you know I tried to
[55:22] tell him I said brother Tom you can't
[55:23] tell the world about these things but
[55:25] you know what what there's one sitting
[55:28] right back there right that'll tell you
[55:31] that while he was holding that thing
[55:33] over him and and all and he was doing
[55:35] weightlifting and brother Gary made the
[55:37] wrong mistake while he was doing the
[55:39] weightlifting with the big bars he said
[55:41] you know any place to go to
[55:46] church he couldn't
[55:48] move cuz all he had to do was drop the
[55:52] weights and he did he dropped the weight
[55:54] of where to go right
[55:56] well all right so that's the point but
[56:00] now do you see what I'm talking about I
[56:02] mean my point is that there's scripture
[56:04] for you and I right to
[56:07] fulfill there are still scriptures to be
[56:11] fulfilled now when we get out of here
[56:14] God is going to Israel right you know
[56:17] that that scripture that's not
[56:19] fulfilled right amen so when he goes to
[56:23] Israel and they receive the Gospel they
[56:26] can say this is present tense truth to
[56:29] us
[56:31] right
[56:33] agree but see when are we going to
[56:35] realize that this message is Made Alive
[56:38] in you and I in this present tense
[56:43] right the truth this
[56:46] day this scripture is fulfilled don't
[56:49] you believe we're in the end of the time
[56:51] don't you believe that we've already in
[56:52] the process of the Lord himself
[56:54] descending from heaven with a sh the
[56:55] message Mage right amen don't you
[56:57] believe those things amen all right then
[57:00] the dead is waiting on you and I right
[57:03] how about Hebrews 11:40 they without us
[57:08] all those Warriors of Faith the dead
[57:11] raised the sick healed uh Lions killed
[57:14] Giants killed all kind of the whole
[57:17] Hebrews
[57:18] 11 and he assed up by saying they
[57:22] without us cannot be made perfect right
[57:26] well see then the Bible's right they're
[57:28] groaning right
[57:30] waiting on you and
[57:34] I waiting on you and
[57:37] I right that's hard to think about
[57:42] it and then we let the devil be a good
[57:46] little buddy with us you know talk us
[57:49] out of even thinking it's for us oh yeah
[57:51] it's for yeah I agree now I believe that
[57:54] Bible right
[57:57] but you're just not the
[58:00] person
[58:03] well hang
[58:05] around I'm talking to him hang around
[58:09] because you told the Lord Jesus that he
[58:11] wasn't that person
[58:14] yeah one day proved it
[58:17] right and you can't argue with him no
[58:19] more you know it I'm talking to
[58:23] Satan he can't argue because he knows
[58:26] what he
[58:27] done brother Brown said he believes him
[58:30] to be Hebrews 13:8 a whole lot more than
[58:32] you and I do
[58:36] right all right but
[58:40] now they without us cannot come to a
[58:44] completion see we spend a lot of time
[58:47] and that's that's all right I do too now
[58:49] I've done it too we're talking about the
[58:51] word perfect and what it means and how
[58:53] it doesn't mean what we used to think it
[58:54] mean all that that's that's fine
[58:56] but do we go on to say that they can't
[58:59] be complete without us do we see the key
[59:02] that without us they can't be made
[59:04] complete we don't talk about the us
[59:09] see we only talk about the things of how
[59:13] something is perfect right or what it
[59:16] means but they without us cannot be made
[59:19] perfect right what about what your
[59:21] Prophet had to
[59:23] say right so we must depend upon what he
[59:26] would be
[59:27] saying I gave you some quotes where we
[59:30] talking about the word for each age you
[59:33] got those like Christ identified the
[59:35] same 1964 4
[59:38] 4:15 he's talking about the word for the
[59:41] age when that word is ready to be
[59:44] manifested now what he said you take my
[59:47] word when the word is ready to be
[59:49] manifested God sends down a
[59:52] prophet to reveal the word all right
[59:56] we believe God sent a
[1:00:01] prophet to reveal the
[1:00:04] word
[1:00:06] now he said one day that that Prophet
[1:00:09] would be pointing to the skies to a word
[1:00:12] born
[1:00:17] bride that's what he's going to be
[1:00:19] pointing in he was pointing those things
[1:00:22] to you and I but do you believe what
[1:00:24] he's saying
[1:00:26] read all them I gave you the word for
[1:00:28] each
[1:00:29] age we talk about IM morphe that's why
[1:00:32] we're not
[1:00:33] Oneness because one this believe Jesus
[1:00:35] was the last and morphe of
[1:00:37] God all right now but we believe the
[1:00:41] bride is the last IM morphe of the
[1:00:43] Gentile dispensation then he goes to
[1:00:46] Israel and they'll be the last IM morphe
[1:00:48] you know but we believe the truth so I
[1:00:50] gave you a quote there who this mzd 1965
[1:00:54] 221 says what a glorious saying God in
[1:00:57] morphe mask in a pillar of fire god in
[1:01:02] morphe in a man called Jesus God in
[1:01:05] morphe in his
[1:01:08] church God above us God With Us God in
[1:01:13] us the condescending of of God and he
[1:01:17] goes on down and it's the last part of
[1:01:18] that he says that was God above us God
[1:01:20] With Us now it's God in us the Holy
[1:01:22] Spirit not the third person the same
[1:01:25] person
[1:01:27] right and what does that do
[1:01:31] then look at God's only provided place
[1:01:34] of worship 1965 11:28 the morning
[1:01:36] service paragraph 264 he says no leaven
[1:01:40] among
[1:01:42] you that brings the entire fullness of
[1:01:46] the godhead bodily among
[1:01:50] you now there's a good old
[1:01:53] devil yeah but we go got
[1:01:58] Liv so it'll never
[1:02:07] happen if God promis it it
[1:02:12] will forget about the rest of it right
[1:02:17] right all right he said it couldn't
[1:02:20] happen in Luther's age why ca us to be
[1:02:22] fulfilled in this age right couldn't
[1:02:24] happen in Wesley's days wouldn't do it
[1:02:26] in the Pentecostal age but in the day
[1:02:28] when the son of man will be manifested
[1:02:31] revealed brought back the church
[1:02:34] together now listen to him the church
[1:02:37] together with the entire deity of God
[1:02:40] amongst his people showing the same
[1:02:42] visible signs and manifestation that he
[1:02:45] did at the
[1:02:46] beginning do you believe
[1:02:49] iten Christ mystery of God reveal 6 1963
[1:02:53] 728 page 56
[1:02:56] and in there there'd be a Time come
[1:02:58] forth when he could express himself in
[1:03:01] the fullness of his godhead deity
[1:03:03] through his
[1:03:04] church have the preeminence in this
[1:03:07] church oh my what the anointed man now
[1:03:10] the anointed people oh my to bring back
[1:03:13] the anointed bride and the bridegroom
[1:03:15] anointed by
[1:03:17] why accepting what Eve turned down and
[1:03:20] Adam coming back with the anointing of
[1:03:23] the word because he said my word is
[1:03:25] spirit in
[1:03:32] life message called
[1:03:34] pardoned preached in 1963 tuon Arizona
[1:03:38] 10:28 he's talking about eternal life
[1:03:40] and the Holy Spirit resting within you
[1:03:42] and bringing forth the life he said God
[1:03:45] is waiting the hour to see his church
[1:03:48] come to that
[1:03:49] position regardless of denomination
[1:03:52] regardless of creed color whatever it
[1:03:54] may be that his entire church would come
[1:03:57] to the place that they're displaying the
[1:04:00] token of the death of Jesus
[1:04:07] Christ Christ is the Myster of God
[1:04:09] revealed 1963
[1:04:11] 7:28 page
[1:04:13] 25 God expressed in Jesus Christ who was
[1:04:18] both Father Son and Holy Ghost the
[1:04:20] fullness of the godhead bodily now the
[1:04:24] complete fullness of the godhead had
[1:04:26] bodily dwells in his
[1:04:28] church the preeminence all that God was
[1:04:31] he poured into Christ all that Christ
[1:04:33] was is poured into the church the
[1:04:35] believer not the denomination he said
[1:04:37] we'll get to that in finish and show you
[1:04:40] we have
[1:04:41] seen his star 1963
[1:04:46] 126 when Christ Jesus was being formed
[1:04:49] now
[1:04:51] listen because when brother R said he
[1:04:54] said when the bride be to say I and my
[1:04:57] father are one and the other things he
[1:04:59] said them denominations will swing
[1:05:02] together right so now watch him as
[1:05:05] reason I gave you this when Christ Jesus
[1:05:07] was being formed in Mary that's when the
[1:05:10] persecution set in that's right so I
[1:05:13] thought that's what it want to be formed
[1:05:15] in you and
[1:05:16] I that's when her persecution started
[1:05:19] and it's the same thing in you Galatians
[1:05:22] 1 or Galatians 4:19 says that when
[1:05:25] Christ the hope of glory formed formed
[1:05:28] in you Christ is being formed in you
[1:05:31] when you are dying and Christ is coming
[1:05:33] to life watch the persecutions that end
[1:05:36] watch trouble start on every hand watch
[1:05:39] The Devil go on a rampage certainly when
[1:05:42] Christ is being formed in
[1:05:44] you mighty God unveil 1964
[1:05:48] 629 then it was God in them days it was
[1:05:51] God in man his son Jesus Christ we
[1:05:55] believe that not just a prophet not just
[1:05:58] an ordinary man ordinary human it was
[1:06:01] God in Christ God in a man the fullness
[1:06:04] of the godhead bodily in a man God in
[1:06:07] man now it's God in men see the fullness
[1:06:11] of God in the godhead bodily in his
[1:06:13] entire church manifesting himself
[1:06:16] fulfilling his word that's right okay
[1:06:19] when are we going to believe
[1:06:23] it I like this one and I just picked it
[1:06:26] out we have seen his star 19631
[1:06:30] 12:16 he's talking about the baby's form
[1:06:33] for a long time along in the womb but
[1:06:37] this is coming to the coming the last
[1:06:39] days when the completeness when the
[1:06:42] fullness of the godhead when the
[1:06:44] fullness of Christ is to be manifested
[1:06:47] among his people he said so he promised
[1:06:52] it in his word
[1:06:55] you believe
[1:06:59] it do you believe
[1:07:01] it the bride becomes the fullness of the
[1:07:04] godhead
[1:07:08] Bly he said God is not
[1:07:12] complete without you
[1:07:16] right a scripture a time a day an hour
[1:07:20] mhm for you and I to believe who we are
[1:07:24] amen
[1:07:26] we talk about
[1:07:27] adoption but everybody wants to look
[1:07:30] it well where's the signs and
[1:07:34] wonders well open your
[1:07:36] eyes wake
[1:07:38] up and
[1:07:41] believe amen but the greatest sign and
[1:07:44] wonder is for the word of God to be open
[1:07:47] because Satan can impersonate all of the
[1:07:50] gifts and the signs and wonders right
[1:07:52] right brother around said he can pass
[1:07:54] out Supernatural gift
[1:07:55] that's
[1:07:56] right amen see we always thought God was
[1:08:00] the only one to do it he said Satan
[1:08:01] could that's right but said he can't be
[1:08:05] the
[1:08:12] word he said he can't be the word he
[1:08:15] said I wish I could do like some of
[1:08:17] these other brothers he told one of them
[1:08:19] you know I forgot who it was might have
[1:08:20] been thean but I'm not certain he said
[1:08:23] just go set Down Under that old oak tree
[1:08:27] brother BOS and he said he has really
[1:08:31] done it he said cuz he goes out and said
[1:08:34] he just stands right there with a word
[1:08:36] and he said he just lays it down and
[1:08:39] said Satan can't
[1:08:41] argue with the word
[1:08:44] right but see it's when we
[1:08:47] believe right all right now Jesus went
[1:08:52] through a lot of things right but then
[1:08:55] one day he sat
[1:08:57] down he read a
[1:09:00] scripture and he said
[1:09:04] am he said this
[1:09:06] day this
[1:09:08] scripture is fulfilled
[1:09:11] right right amen you I believe we're in
[1:09:16] a day when we can say this
[1:09:20] day a lot of these scriptures that we've
[1:09:22] spoken of have been fulfilled absolutely
[1:09:26] amen and we're in the process
[1:09:29] of more being
[1:09:33] fulfilled don't worry about exhausting
[1:09:35] the word it can't be
[1:09:40] done just get into it study it pray and
[1:09:46] believe because as I said to start with
[1:09:49] and what I did there Sunday afternoon
[1:09:52] the word manifest is to make known
[1:09:55] that's right what do you think we're
[1:09:57] talking
[1:09:58] about you make him known he will come
[1:10:02] with signs and wonders and make you
[1:10:05] known brother brandom made God known you
[1:10:09] agree it's why he would not allow he
[1:10:12] used to allow people to preach and he
[1:10:15] would come behind them and just pray for
[1:10:17] the sick but he stopped doing it right
[1:10:20] see because it had to be a
[1:10:23] message he couldn't trust nobody body
[1:10:25] else to bring
[1:10:28] it so he preached his own message right
[1:10:33] and then the signs and wonders took
[1:10:36] place
[1:10:38] see when we preach Jesus Christ in the
[1:10:41] truth of it you don't have to worry
[1:10:43] about it he'll make you
[1:10:45] manifest and whatever what other
[1:10:47] manifestation would you
[1:10:51] want then to be able to to stay to stand
[1:10:55] and
[1:10:57] say I've tried to make my father
[1:11:02] known got internet while ago man he's
[1:11:07] talking about said you really appreciate
[1:11:09] the godhead
[1:11:10] series and he come down through and he

[1:11:15] this he
[1:11:16] said and when I heard that River
[1:11:19] Jordan he said my heart just didn't
[1:11:21] agree with it that's
[1:11:27] yep that's wonderful amen you know it's
[1:11:31] just one
[1:11:33] person if all brother Tom has is Brother
[1:11:37] Gary on the other
[1:11:40] side if that's all he has to present to
[1:11:44] Christ amen he still has a wonderful you

[1:11:53] have is one person on the internet that

[1:12:04] known I love to talk about my
[1:12:08] father and making my father known to you
[1:12:12] is what I desire to
[1:12:14] do then what he does back in return he

[1:12:22] anything in the world we owe him
[1:12:24] everything name amen that's right
