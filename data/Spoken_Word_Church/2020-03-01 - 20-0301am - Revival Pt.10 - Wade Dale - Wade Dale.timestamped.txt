[23:26] Oh

[23:36] hey man good to be in house with Lord
[23:39] didn't have all of you here today we
[23:43] need to lift up prayer for brother Dale
[23:46] home they're watching and pray that the
[23:50] Lord be with him and bring them out all
[23:53] this and everybody else tell your
[23:54] brother dick and all the ones that are
[23:56] sick sister Jean no different ones we
[24:00] are you know the world is looking at all
[24:03] this coronavirus and all this stuff and
[24:05] you know what it does just puts fear in
[24:07] the heart of people but the Bible tells
[24:10] us fear not you know as I was listening
[24:15] to the radio the other day and you pick
[24:18] up little tidbits 365 days are in the
[24:22] year right besides this leap year which
[24:24] is yesterday y'all had an extra day
[24:27] right so you felt a lot of older because
[24:28] you had an extra day yesterday but 365
[24:32] days in the year do you know that
[24:33] exactly 365 times in the Bible it says
[24:37] fear not fear not for I am with you fear
[24:43] not fear not because what does fear fear
[24:46] brings torment so let's forget about all
[24:48] this fear that the world is bringing
[24:50] onto us and let's just think about the
[24:53] Word of God if we worried more by our
[24:56] soul than we do our body would might be
[24:59] all right but if you got your Bibles
[25:01] we're gonna continue with revival we
[25:04] were I sitting yesterday trying to
[25:07] figure out if we needed to continue or
[25:10] not and I believe the Lord gave us some
[25:12] thought for a couple more sermons and
[25:14] brother Dale cut and couldn't be able to
[25:16] be here this morning so this is enough
[25:19] this is an oddity to not have our pastor
[25:22] with us in the building most of the time
[25:24] you can but but for for his for his his
[25:29] safety sake in his body he's wore out
[25:32] he's tired let him rest right we just
[25:36] lift him up in prayer so Psalms 1 38 8
[25:40] we're gonna do part 10 and 11 there's
[25:42] one thing I have not covered that is
[25:46] where the Bible tells us in Amos
[25:48] about being a famine in the land not of
[25:51] food and water Lord we got plenty of
[25:53] that but it's a famine for hearing the
[25:56] Word of God but we'll speak more of that
[25:58] this afternoon this morning we're just
[26:00] going to background a little bit and
[26:02] fill in some gaps that we have kind of
[26:05] skipped over in this service of this
[26:08] revival series remember brother Aaron to
[26:10] be preaching for us Wednesday night
[26:12] brother Louisa's in Jacksonville with
[26:15] the group down there
[26:16] I believe he spoke Friday night he's a
[26:19] brother Keith Browns today maybe or
[26:21] yesterday but just remember him in
[26:23] prayer coming back coming back combing
[26:28] brother Aaron wings tonight
[26:29] next Saturday remember March the 7th at
[26:34] 3 o'clock we'll start our youth the
[26:36] Bible study we'll have a phone
[26:38] Pete say at 3 o'clock and then the
[26:41] service starts right there after brother
[26:44] John will be leading the singing but
[26:46] other luisa be doing speaking then we'll
[26:48] have questions and answers also remember
[26:50] next Saturday night change your clocks
[26:54] spring forward there you go yeah praise

[27:17] and we'll be back on whatever this is
[27:20] regular time I guess that was daylight
[27:23] saving this is regular time and also
[27:26] time chains I'm trying to remember all
[27:28] this marks our tenth brother Dale is
[27:31] gonna go for a shoulder surgery
[27:33] so we'll keep him in your prayer that
[27:34] all this will clear up so he can get
[27:36] that done it's it's he suffered with it
[27:39] for a long time his shoulders been all
[27:42] all tore up so we believe in doctors
[27:46] amen that's what I've told him this
[27:48] morning I said look brother Bob had some
[27:53] emergency in his pocket you know for
[27:56] vitamin C my sister treated Macmillan
[27:58] about to two or three years ago she said
[28:01] you're not
[28:01] taking enough vitamin C so I take 2,000
[28:05] milligrams in the morning and 2,000
[28:07] milligrams in the afternoon and I have
[28:09] not had a cold for three years but I
[28:12] take it every day don't do like people

[28:15] tell June about right now they'll come
[28:17] in honey it's not for my allergies no

[28:28] Sam sick you got to get in your body get

[28:41] it all the bad things are in it and all
[28:43] the good things are being cooked out of
[28:44] it
[28:45] so God give us I believe he gave us
[28:47] everything in the earth to take care of
[28:49] our needs so take 2,000 milligrams of
[28:53] vitamin C in the morning in 2000 in the

[29:38] 38 8 all minds clear just remember the
[29:41] ones that are not here the Heavenly
[29:44] Father we pray Lord that you would help
[29:45] us today father that we are truly as the
[29:49] prophet of God told us every generation
[29:52] gets weaker and weaker the food we eat
[29:55] is actually killing us we're a long time
[29:57] ago it actually sustained our life and
[29:59] made us strong the Lord according to the
[30:02] fall everything that came out of the
[30:04] ground
[30:05] you cursed back in the garden but Lord
[30:09] you sent an advocate you sent a high
[30:10] priest you sent Jesus Christ on the
[30:14] earth
[30:15] to take away all that we're just trying
[30:17] now to to get this thing through the
[30:20] Ministry of the gospel to get us turned
[30:22] back to that foundation of before the
[30:26] fall where everything Lord was restored
[30:30] back to its rightful position you
[30:34] promised you do that you sent a prophet
[30:37] in the end time to tell us what you've
[30:39] already said and I pray today Lord that
[30:41] the words we're speaking will be your
[30:43] words Lord and not ours
[30:45] that the hearer Lord may hear and
[30:47] receive revelation because we crave
[30:50] revelation more than anything Lord being
[30:52] the bride in the end time and a way Lord
[30:55] that no one else has been it's not been
[30:59] laid on anyone else Lord but us
[31:03] to have a reverence as direction Lord
[31:06] all those dead Saints coming out of the
[31:08] ground and glorified eternal bodies and
[31:12] Lord then will be changed and it will be
[31:15] taken out of here and then the world can
[31:17] do what they want to do but Lord we'll
[31:19] be safe in your arms
[31:20] we'll be over in that glorious dimension
[31:23] where there's no hurt no sorrow no pain
[31:25] no flus no sickness what I pray that you
[31:29] would be with each one here in the
[31:31] building Lord that we would truly Lord
[31:35] look to you and not look to man for our
[31:41] answers that will look to you the author
[31:43] and finisher of our faith Lord and that
[31:46] what we do have today will become a
[31:48] revival in our heart and it'll take care
[31:51] of all these diseases Lord the first
[31:53] diseases of disease of the heart of the
[31:57] soul of man Lord we by the new birth has
[32:00] been cleaned out but father some may not
[32:03] be in that position yet Lord but we
[32:05] truly need a cleaning of our spirit Lord
[32:07] we need a cleaning Lord that will clean
[32:10] those flus out as we're getting ready to
[32:11] speak again Lord about you how that you
[32:16] came and cleaned us out Lord and caused
[32:18] the revival on this earth probably give
[32:21] us this day our daily bread be the ones
[32:22] that are not here people the
[32:24] missionaries on the foreign fields give
[32:25] them fruit for the labor father in Jesus
[32:27] name we ask these things
[32:29] the bride of Jesus Christ says Amen
[32:31] Psalm 138 8 we're just going to review
[32:34] just a little bit and then we will try
[32:38] to set a stage for this afternoon and
[32:40] talk about a famine though I'll walk in
[32:45] the midst of trouble that will revive me
[32:48] thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[32:51] against the wrath of my enemies and our
[32:54] right hand shall save me now that's the
[32:57] right hand of power we know that the
[32:59] Lord will perfect that which concerning
[33:01] to me we're depending on him we can't be
[33:06] perfect in ourselves we're dependent on
[33:08] him the Lord will perfect that which
[33:11] concerning to me thy mercy O Lord
[33:12] endureth forever forsake not the works
[33:15] of thine own hands let's read Psalms 85
[33:18] 1 and then you'll be seated
[33:20] turn us O God of our salvation and
[33:22] caused on anger toward us to cease look
[33:25] I'll be angry with us forever
[33:27] wilt out draw out thine anger to all
[33:29] generations wilt thou not revive us
[33:33] again that thy people may rejoice indeed
[33:38] you may be seated in the Lord having
[33:39] blessing to the reading of the word but
[33:43] while you're while you got your Bibles
[33:45] open or if you don't have your Bible
[33:46] let's read here this is 2 I want you to
[33:48] keep this in the back of your mind today
[33:49] that we're we're going to talk tonight
[33:52] or this afternoon about famine and what
[33:56] what the Lord said in the Bible and Amos
[33:58] 8 if you'll pull that up
[34:00] let's think about this yesterday we've
[34:03] been talking about waters and cleansing
[34:05] and and all these different things and
[34:08] look what Amos says verse 11 behold the
[34:12] days come saith the Lord so it's coming
[34:14] I say it's here that I will send a
[34:17] famine in the land not a famine of bread
[34:20] or thirst for water my heavenly days
[34:23] we've had enough rain in the past three
[34:25] weeks to take care of that but listen we
[34:29] have clean drinking water truly we have
[34:32] all the food we can eat and then some
[34:37] but God is not talking about that he's
[34:39] not talking about a famine of bread nor
[34:41] thirst for water but of the hearing but
[34:46] of hearing the words of the Lord all
[34:50] right now look and they shall wander
[34:52] from sea to sea and from North even to
[34:55] east they shall run to and fro to seek
[34:58] the Word of God a word of the Lord and
[35:01] shall not find it in that day shall the
[35:05] fair virgins and young men faint for
[35:08] thirst that takes me back to the five
[35:10] wise virgins and five foolish virgins
[35:12] the five foolish virgins they are faint
[35:16] because they turn part of the word down
[35:19] and they didn't get the new birth all
[35:22] right when that day shall the fair
[35:23] virgins and young men faint for thirst
[35:26] now what we're talking about it's just
[35:28] like you leading to a horse to water and
[35:30] it doesn't drink or you you said a
[35:33] little fish is why better be careful
[35:34] drinking the water out of the ocean I
[35:36] may drink it all up you know you but
[35:39] God's then end of the das table fountain
[35:41] there's no way that it's going to ever
[35:42] drop we even know that the river of life
[35:44] there was rivers in the Garden of Eden
[35:46] and then we polluted them as man but
[35:49] then that pure water shows right back up
[35:51] in the Book of Revelations flowing out
[35:54] the River of Life flowing out from under
[35:56] the throne eternally it's not gonna it's
[35:59] not gonna flood brother John it's not
[36:01] going to dry up it's gonna what flow
[36:04] because God's brought everything back by
[36:08] how did he bring it back he didn't bring
[36:09] him back by natural water he brought it
[36:13] back by you and I coming to a position
[36:16] because of the washing of water by the
[36:18] word that we've come to a place that
[36:20] that can flow freely in us and I was
[36:23] thinking yesterday you say well and you
[36:27] know me I don't care much for laundry
[36:29] list of do's and don'ts but when we come
[36:31] to this revival if you don't have a
[36:33] revival inside of you today you know it
[36:39] you know it because you're with you 24/7
[36:44] hey man so who's the problem this is the
[36:51] problem right here all right so let's
[36:54] work on that because
[36:55] what a revival do it stir up what you
[36:57] already got what happens sometimes and
[36:59] being in beekeeping we have we use
[37:02] essential oils in our in our sugar water
[37:07] when they can't get sugar water we give
[37:08] them sugar water plus we put a little
[37:10] vitamins in there some vitamin C mmm are
[37:12] some citric acid and we put things in
[37:14] there to help the bees because they
[37:16] can't get it all because y'all are
[37:17] killing it all with us roundup and all
[37:19] this stuff y'all use so I'm preaching on
[37:21] bees now so anyway but we take these
[37:24] essential oils though and we mix it with
[37:27] water while we emulsify it to a degree
[37:29] but what happens if it sets over time
[37:32] some of your sisters know and many
[37:33] people know that if you leave something
[37:35] somewhere long enough
[37:36] it separates oils at the top waters at
[37:40] the bottom what do you do though now you
[37:46] haven't added any more in it you haven't
[37:49] taken any chemical out you're just
[37:51] shaking up what's already in the bottle
[37:54] well that's what brother branham says
[37:55] and the resurrection of Lazarus he said
[37:57] it's just a stirring up what you already
[37:58] know about what you already know you
[38:02] just haven't used the Bible says
[38:03] exercise exercise what exercise your
[38:08] faith in what you know they said well I
[38:11] don't know this I don't know that that
[38:13] comes by washing the water the word have
[38:15] you made yourself available for that
[38:17] because remember remember the prophet of
[38:19] God said ignorance might be you know
[38:23] they may play ignorant back whenever but
[38:25] you can't plead ignorance now because
[38:27] the full books been open
[38:29] everything's been give us the seven
[38:31] course meal the full plate everything
[38:34] and it's free it's free let's see what
[38:38] brother Brown says let's go and read
[38:39] this I've got two prayers in here I
[38:42] found another one we'll read it a little
[38:43] bit later maybe this afternoon but
[38:45] brother Brown said recognizing your
[38:46] Danis message he said God created me a
[38:49] revival let me be the revival that's our
[38:54] problem we've been waiting for brother
[38:55] Aaron to start a revival we've been
[38:57] waiting for brother David to start a
[38:59] revival sister throwing some brothers
[39:02] doing some work on the home ground
[39:06] because if you start one guess what you
[39:10] started it God started it in you there's
[39:13] nothing nobody else can do with it
[39:14] except it'd be contagious and somebody
[39:18] else grab ahold of it and they start a
[39:19] revival because you guys we have to
[39:21] realize number one you got to realize
[39:23] that what everything was in the bottle
[39:26] it just got separated because of lack of
[39:29] use but if they can shake it up get a
[39:34] preacher get a sunday-school teacher get
[39:37] the prophet of God to stir it up what
[39:40] you're stirring on what you already got
[39:41] mmm like I said before everybody wants
[39:44] to know what the great Seventh Seal is
[39:46] and what the great dis is it's nothing
[39:48] external nothing zero that's what we've
[39:51] been looking for a great somebody a
[39:53] great something California to fall the
[39:55] government to come in and take over the
[39:58] money everything brother mom said it's
[40:00] going to come to pass but now what did
[40:04] the Bible say look up when you see these
[40:06] things for your Redemption draweth night
[40:09] and some of these things that we see you
[40:12] know it's gonna happen if we wait until
[40:14] this happens wait until that happens
[40:17] there's gonna be a voice the prophet of
[40:19] God said it's going because you know
[40:21] what you're gonna say I thought this was
[40:23] supposed to happen I thought this was
[40:24] supposed to happen I thought this was
[40:26] supposed to happen
[40:26] what brother I'm say he said a little
[40:28] voice would come to you and tell you you
[40:31] missed it you missed it why because you
[40:36] were looking for this and not looking
[40:37] for the giver you were looking for all
[40:39] these other things God created me a
[40:41] revival let me be the revival let each
[40:43] one of us be the revival the revival in
[40:46] me make me Lord to hunger make me the
[40:50] thirst created me Lord that one is
[40:52] needed in me let me from this hour on
[40:56] behind more consecrated servant a better
[40:58] servant more blessed of you more able
[41:00] more humbler more kind or more willing
[41:02] to work more looking to the things that
[41:05] are positive for getting things that are
[41:07] in the past the negatives let me press
[41:12] toward the mark of the high calling of
[41:14] Christ amen and then the next one is
[41:17] what I just quoted him into going the
[41:18] resurrection of Lazarus brother Brown
[41:19] what this church needs today is a good
[41:21] revival not a new doctrine not a seven
[41:25] thunder opening of whatever we already
[41:27] got that it's the full plan of
[41:30] redemption and even the prophet of God
[41:33] has said prophet of God said thousands
[41:36] of live voices it's what Satan hates
[41:38] that's the thunder that Satan can't
[41:40] stand he can't stand you living the Word
[41:44] of God he can't stand it what this
[41:49] church needs a good revival not a new
[41:51] doctrine or in you order just two
[41:53] stirring up of what you already know
[41:55] about that oil in that wine and all the
[41:58] different things that the Bible tells us
[41:59] about now listen we have to hear the
[42:02] word of God but I'm telling you one more
[42:04] time if you're waiting for the Sun to
[42:06] stand still the clouds or the moon to
[42:09] turn to darkness all those things have
[42:11] already happened a lot of that stuff's
[42:13] already happened you just might have
[42:16] been looking in the wrong direction
[42:18] but if you're waiting for that all to
[42:20] happen you may be too late if you're
[42:25] looking for you know we always and we do
[42:28] ask the question well you know the
[42:30] question the biggest question is or are
[42:32] we gonna be here when California sings I
[42:35] don't care I really don't care
[42:39] but if you put that at the top of your
[42:41] list you might as well be the only thing
[42:44] on your list because you're not gonna do
[42:47] anything until California sings and what
[42:51] if we're already gone when these things
[42:53] what if the great resurrection in the
[42:55] rapture shakes this whole world and
[42:57] dropped California in the ocean you
[43:00] better be ready before that time comes
[43:02] that's what a revival is we're sitting
[43:05] here we've got the Word of God it's a
[43:07] word revival we know that brother Wade
[43:08] we got the Word of God but what are we
[43:10] doing about it
[43:12] you saw we're sick that has nothing to
[43:15] do with it zero property God said cloudy
[43:22] days doesn't mean God's against you
[43:24] sunny days don't mean he's for you you
[43:27] may have bills piled up this high and
[43:29] you may have ten million dollars in the
[43:31] bank that don't make you no better
[43:32] Christian
[43:33] make you better person but it won't make
[43:35] you no better Christian either way
[43:37] because God's not judging you on the
[43:39] wealth that you have on this earth
[43:41] except for the wealth that you got in
[43:44] your soul what is a man that gains the
[43:47] whole world but loses his soul soul food
[43:52] pardon the black brothers soul food is
[43:55] what we need amen
[43:58] maybe you've been asking for soulful
[44:00] let's all ask for soul food
[44:02] we all need soul food and when you come
[44:06] in and say man you know what you're
[44:08] eating on soul food
[44:12] hey bye alright alright let's look at
[44:15] number three
[44:16] then we begin to find out
[44:19] miracles isn't taking place in the more
[44:22] like they were the sick go home sick it
[44:26] isn't because of God it's because of the
[44:30] lack of the revival among the people
[44:33] there is no revival they sit and listen
[44:38] go home and say well I guess that was
[44:40] pretty good mm-hmm see there's not that
[44:43] zeal now we covered this before or the
[44:46] or an ardor our there's not a something
[44:49] you want to grab a whole - there's not
[44:51] that something in the people that should
[44:53] be there well listen the only person
[44:56] that knows that is you not me remember
[45:01] the preacher can't bring a revival we've
[45:03] read those quotes over and over for
[45:05] about nine other sermon preacher can't
[45:07] bring a revival I can only brother down
[45:10] all the ministers can only what gets you
[45:13] to see what God's already done and that
[45:17] we do need a word revival we've already
[45:19] had different revivals of different
[45:21] things we need a word revival to where
[45:24] the Word of God you say well what is
[45:26] that well what does the word tell you to
[45:28] do the word of God here we go we're
[45:31] going to do a laundry list it tells you
[45:33] sisters now cut your iron okay let me
[45:36] hear you no don't wear pants all these
[45:39] different if you can check them off I
[45:42] was reading the quote or brother Brown
[45:44] I'll bring it I wasn't gonna do it but I
[45:46] now brother Brian was in this meeting
[45:48] and he said I preached away and he said
[45:50] I preached on sin of every kind and he
[45:54] said a good little Saint a little
[45:56] Baptist woman walked up to me after the
[45:58] service and she said brother Branham
[46:00] said you weren't preaching on me today
[46:02] said all those things I don't do said
[46:07] she walked off and brother brother Brown
[46:08] said he was standing there said another
[46:09] one walked up and said what was she
[46:11] telling you and he said well said she
[46:13] that I preached on sin and preached on
[46:15] all these things and said didn't hit her
[46:18] up didn't have it not of what said she's
[46:19] never done none of them coming to rich
[46:21] young ruler he said that sister leaned
[46:23] over and said brother Branham she's the
[46:25] worst gossiper in the whole church he
[46:28] said that was the one thing I didn't hit
[46:30] on so she could say he went breaching on
[46:37] me because of the laundry list but now
[46:40] the gossiping he didn't preach on so she
[46:43] must have been free from all that but it
[46:46] was kind of funny for you know you
[46:47] brother Branham I believe everything
[46:49] brother I'm dead was ordained of God
[46:52] under the auspice of the word now I'm
[46:53] not talk about a human being we're asked
[46:55] to eat and have children not know but
[46:57] when he was when he was walking when he
[46:59] found the brook when this lady walks up
[47:01] when this other late these two ladies
[47:03] says when he called me a Buzzard when he
[47:04] called me an eagle all those things were
[47:08] a life of a prophet to show us that God
[47:11] was dealing with him so that he can deal
[47:13] with me in you in the same way so I'm
[47:16] not here today to tell you if you're a
[47:18] gossiper you shouldn't gossip but you
[47:20] got all these things you should know
[47:22] it's been preached all these things have
[47:24] been preached we should know these
[47:26] things there's not a zeal there's
[47:33] something in the people that should be
[47:34] there what is it
[47:37] it's a stirring up are you to realize
[47:40] you don't have it because there's all
[47:43] these things then he said well I've not
[47:45] got my healing I mean you know men June
[47:47] and I've been praying for our children
[47:49] for years and nothing's happened well
[47:51] you know what you keep praying something
[47:54] will happen
[47:56] [Music]
[48:01] if you stop god knew you were gonna stop
[48:06] and he doesn't have to do anything else
[48:08] after that because he only goes by your
[48:11] confession what you confess amen so
[48:16] don't stop those who endure to the end
[48:18] if you ever heard that scripture those
[48:20] who endure to the end shall be saved I'm
[48:25] not an advocate of deathbed confessions
[48:27] but if it'll get them in any in glory
[48:30] with me
[48:31] so be it but the Bible said you'll be
[48:34] there with the offsprings now be there
[48:35] means be there amen so let's just
[48:39] realize what we've got we need to give
[48:42] it out to our family live that thing
[48:47] listen I'm gonna tell you all of you
[48:49] something there was not and I'm off on
[48:53] the rabbit and want a rabbit trail here
[48:57] all right I'll get back in a minute
[49:02] but you said we say we want our children
[49:04] saved and Warner to see our children in
[49:06] church and you come half the time half
[49:11] the time there was never an option when
[49:16] we weren't Scott when we were growing up
[49:18] and a shake in the head tends to be
[49:21] shaking his head mama shaking her head
[49:23] I'm shaking my head daddy's head shake
[49:25] his head some of it some of y'all I
[49:27] think you get up on Sunday morning go
[49:28] it's Sunday
[49:29] o Church what an option we knew we were
[49:44] going to tell some honey both services
[49:49] our parents drugged us they drugged us
[49:54] we're on girls till we were about 18
[49:58] they drag us to church every Sunday
[50:03] young people I don't want it to be a
[50:05] drug I want you to be happy to come to
[50:08] church that was my problem and their
[50:10] problem - it was just because we had to
[50:12] I don't want that to be that I want you
[50:15] to come to church to worship God I want
[50:18] you to listen to what God has to say and
[50:20] you say well I got these problems that's
[50:21] why we opened this thing up to the youth
[50:23] group because they do have problems you
[50:25] can't just say that's not a problem
[50:27] no we went through it ourselves if
[50:30] you'll remember back you know there's
[50:32] things that we didn't go through that
[50:34] they go through now but same devil and
[50:38] the same results same devil same results
[50:43] he'll Drive you away from church he'll
[50:46] drive you away from each other
[50:48] Satan does not want you to fellowship I
[50:53] said before I tell you again I just I
[50:55] talked to a preacher a couple months ago
[50:56] he got so depressed because he heard
[51:00] people was saying that he didn't preach
[51:01] deep enough doctrine then he was gone
[51:05] all the time now that may have been a
[51:06] problem but anyway he's been and all
[51:09] these different things so the first
[51:10] thing the preacher did was is how did
[51:12] old wowsie wowsie woo oh woe is me party
[51:14] and he went and separated himself from
[51:17] fellowship they'd in the motel for two
[51:21] days he said that's exactly what the
[51:23] devil wanted me to do he said I thought
[51:24] I was gonna get away to talk to God he
[51:27] said but the devil was there talking to
[51:28] me when I got there
[51:29] okay so that's the same thing with you
[51:32] and I as I told the church before we're
[51:35] sheep
[51:36] we're lambs we are herd animals that's
[51:41] why God herds us here on Wednesday night
[51:43] and herds us here on Sunday because of
[51:46] what happens when the animal leaves the
[51:49] herd wolf will separate one person and
[51:58] you know what happens after that he'll
[52:00] kill him he'll eat them but if we stay
[52:02] together lying together I'm not saying
[52:04] we're not I'm just telling you to look
[52:05] at these things
[52:06] brother Brown said bye and closer as the
[52:08] day comes bind closer together
[52:10] pray for each other
[52:12] but there's not that zeal there's not
[52:14] there's not that something in the people
[52:16] that should be listen that something's
[52:18] got to come that something's got to be
[52:22] here be glad to rejoice the children of
[52:29] Zion Zola
[52:30] Joel 2:23 let me ask you a question
[52:36] going to anyway how much real studying
[52:42] do we do during the week how much real
[52:47] studying now now listen my study and I
[52:50] don't know why I'm doing this but I got
[52:51] about another hour so I'm gonna take my
[52:53] time so when we my studying is different
[52:59] from yours I'd be driving a mail Jeep I
[53:01] know some of y'all can't do two things
[53:03] at once
[53:03] but I can drive a mail Jeep be thinking
[53:06] about God I can think about one word or
[53:07] you can you do the same thing but let it
[53:11] be a time though that there is a time
[53:13] that you sit somewhere with God and talk
[53:19] to him talk to him nobody else but do
[53:26] you ever just grab your Bible just start
[53:30] reading now US ministers are different
[53:34] we have to every Sunday and every
[53:35] Wednesday we have to get a channel but
[53:37] you can study many different things as
[53:40] laity but you know what will happen if
[53:42] you'll start studying and it'll be
[53:44] something that you have a question about
[53:47] I'll promise you mr. milk is smiling and
[53:52] shaking her head because she knows it
[53:54] God will absolutely either change my
[53:57] sermon her brother Dale sermon or send
[53:59] us down another direction just to help
[54:01] you I was in Oklahoma several years ago
[54:04] and you know me I have to have they all
[54:07] know I'm izip driving I got my notes and
[54:09] we go right by these if I lost these I
[54:10] probably shut up but that's the way a
[54:13] teacher is I had an evangelist tell me
[54:15] one time he said I don't preach like you
[54:17] I preached my inspiration so well I'm
[54:20] not inspired then I need to quit
[54:22] I just took it is what he said but I was
[54:28] we were in Oklahoma we were broke large
[54:30] house and I had my two sermons ready to
[54:35] go revival 10 and 11 note wasn't that
[54:40] being believed something else God woke
[54:42] me up at 6:30 that morning on Sunday
[54:44] popped me straight up in the bed and
[54:46] said preach on this right here nobody
[54:49] that rattled my chain and my brain
[54:51] because I'd never done that before
[54:53] I'd never just opened the Bible and
[54:56] preach the sermon especially - but I
[54:59] tell you the story behind that is though
[55:01] I preached on God told me what to preach
[55:04] on he's to preach on Abraham now that's
[55:06] all I said
[55:06] preach on Abraham walking straight up
[55:08] the preach on Abraham so I had
[55:11] remembered I had just several months ago
[55:13] went through the series where brother
[55:15] Branham preached on Abraham to 14-foot
[55:18] took a chapter 14 15 16 17 18 and typed
[55:22] the believer the walk of the believer
[55:24] well I had no notes all I had was just
[55:26] what was in my head being way so I
[55:28] brought that forth and I said you know
[55:30] it was good I stumbled through a few
[55:31] things but it was alright and then after
[55:33] the service this sister come up to me
[55:35] and she said brother wait she said
[55:36] that's exactly because her family had
[55:39] come she said that's exactly what me and
[55:41] my family had talked about the night
[55:44] before and they had some questions and
[55:47] she said you answered every one of them
[55:49] now see that is going by the way that's
[55:52] God listen it's not God being nothing
[55:55] for me it ain't making me nothing making
[55:57] you because you were the one they're the
[55:59] ones that had the connection I didn't
[56:00] they changed my sermon they changed it
[56:06] because of what a question that her
[56:09] family had had that they had talked
[56:10] about the night before that she couldn't
[56:12] answer the question she said you
[56:14] answered all every one of them so that's
[56:17] what we're looking at sometimes we do go
[56:20] off on rabbit trails and things but
[56:26] somebody's here to get it
[56:28] Joel Joel to be glad and you children of
[56:31] Zion rejoice in the Lord your God we
[56:33] have given you he give this to you he
[56:39] has given you the former rain for giving
[56:41] you the rain I want remember rain is
[56:43] white rain is revival the former rain
[56:46] and the latter rain in the first month
[56:49] now we've been through this before
[56:51] remember he will cause to come down for
[56:53] you the the revival the former revival
[56:56] in the latter revival you and I under
[56:58] this messenger in this last hour or were
[57:02] under two revivals now this is one part
[57:05] I didn't bring out so this is a part
[57:06] that's going to fill in a little bit we
[57:08] we are now not under two revivals but we
[57:11] came under two revivals the first
[57:13] revival of brother Branham was was the
[57:15] healing revival and then remember the
[57:20] messenger Malachi forced to do two
[57:21] things
[57:22] but now brother Brown tells you that it
[57:25] wasn't his message so that revival was
[57:28] for the world that revival was for the
[57:32] worldwide he went seven times around the
[57:35] world but in 1962 1963 64 65 somewhere
[57:40] in there all those sermons they were
[57:43] honed down to one thing and that was a
[57:45] word revival an opening of the seals
[57:47] where he may have taught him a little
[57:50] bit different before but now when the
[57:52] angel met him down there and he makes
[57:57] the call wherever he was Arizona and
[57:59] told him to go back to Jeffersonville he
[58:03] came with an open book and now you and I
[58:07] are living under that revival the
[58:09] revival of the open book where God's not
[58:13] going to wink in our ignorance because
[58:15] of us not knowing what's going on
[58:17] because with an open book listen John
[58:20] didn't need a closed book Johnny need an
[58:24] open book so whatever that book was it's
[58:27] now in John according to revelations 10
[58:30] right so who's John topping the whole
[58:34] bride so that word opening of the word
[58:37] is not just for William Marion Branham
[58:40] it's for you
[58:43] he brought his former reign which is a
[58:46] teaching rain but the latter rain is a
[58:49] harvest of what was planted 1962 brother
[58:54] man preach the spoken word is the
[58:56] original seed now that seed has been
[58:59] planted brother mom said Oral Roberts
[59:01] planted a seed Billy Graham planted a
[59:03] seed and I planted the seed now that
[59:05] seed of Oral Roberts and Billy Graham
[59:07] was not a word revival go back to the
[59:12] characteristics of a word revival word
[59:13] revival has to be 100% word correct
[59:16] they were both Trinitarians they both
[59:19] baptized name Father Son hook now God
[59:21] winked at their ignorance because you
[59:23] know what they were to do they were to
[59:25] blind the people member they were the
[59:26] two prophets that went to Sodom and
[59:29] Gomorrah and blinded the people but
[59:34] remember one stayed back with Abraham
[59:38] one stayed back and that person revealed
[59:40] to Abraham that he was going to have a
[59:43] promise and he was going to take a body
[59:45] change listen then people in Sodom and
[59:49] Gomorrah didn't take a body change they
[59:51] died by fire and brimstone by what by
[59:56] what all Roberts and Billy Graham
[59:58] preached to this world that revival is
[1:00:00] over with but that revival is what the
[1:00:04] denominations are still living under and
[1:00:07] that's what I said before are we still
[1:00:10] living under you know hey I'm gonna say
[1:00:13] it anyway I know they came out not too
[1:00:16] long ago with a tape of just brother
[1:00:19] branham's prayer lines that's okay
[1:00:23] that's not gonna that's not word revival
[1:00:25] that's not gonna do anything you but
[1:00:27] make you feel better
[1:00:28] and maybe give you faith for a body
[1:00:31] healing but that's not the word that's
[1:00:35] part of the word
[1:00:36] you can't take healing out of the Bible
[1:00:39] can't take little hands out of the Bible
[1:00:41] but now the Bible says lay hands on the
[1:00:43] sick and they shall recover don't even
[1:00:44] say pray for the Bible says the prayer
[1:00:47] of faith will save the sick you don't
[1:00:48] have to put the two together we're
[1:00:51] praying for people now that we can't
[1:00:52] physically touch you we're believing
[1:00:54] that God's gonna heal them
[1:00:56] but that's not the revival were under
[1:01:00] listen and the floor shall be full of
[1:01:05] wheat the fact shall overflow with wine
[1:01:07] and oil and I will restore to you the
[1:01:10] years that the locusts eat cankerworm
[1:01:13] katha pollitt palma worm my great army
[1:01:16] which i send among you if you'll read
[1:01:18] the restoration in the broad tree you'll
[1:01:19] understand that those different bugs
[1:01:21] same bugs different stage of the bug did
[1:01:25] different things to this broad tree the
[1:01:26] same thing with all the organizations
[1:01:28] and all the different things God cannot
[1:01:31] give a word revival to anyone but the
[1:01:33] bride of Jesus Christ I hope you see
[1:01:39] that I don't want to be exclusive God
[1:01:41] remember brother Brown said he said God
[1:01:44] believed in segregation now you know we
[1:01:48] don't common human segregate we don't
[1:01:51] believe that but God said separate
[1:01:53] yourself God said come out of her my
[1:01:56] people God is a segregationist he
[1:01:58] doesn't want us to go down into Egypt
[1:02:00] will read in about it to end
[1:02:02] he told Abram to stay who he was that
[1:02:07] but because of a famine Abram went Egypt
[1:02:11] and got out of the will of God and
[1:02:13] that's what we're going to talk about
[1:02:15] later on we'll get to that family in
[1:02:17] just a minute
[1:02:18] now we're restored to you so there's a
[1:02:20] promise of restoration two years they're
[1:02:23] locusts that seat can't-can't worm
[1:02:25] pommel worm caterpillar my great army
[1:02:29] and remember this restoration of a bride
[1:02:36] tree is a word revival
[1:02:40] non-denominational revival listen
[1:02:43] brother Bram tells us the domination is
[1:02:45] what eat it down the denomination's was
[1:02:49] the problem of the eating down and I
[1:02:53] don't mean Baptist Methodist I mean
[1:02:54] anything listen anything contrary to the
[1:02:56] Word of God is the denomination you can
[1:02:59] be a one man denomination you can sit
[1:03:01] here and denominator and die because of
[1:03:04] what your own thoughts let's look at
[1:03:08] number four
[1:03:09] excuse me broken system brother Brown
[1:03:13] says how about that water bubbling up on
[1:03:15] the ground
[1:03:16] you don't need a filter no strainer no
[1:03:18] pumping no jerking no nothing else it's
[1:03:20] just there bubbling up but what's
[1:03:25] pushing you what's pushing you what's
[1:03:30] pushing you today there's something
[1:03:33] inside pushing you to go to jump on to
[1:03:35] go to church don't want a match play to
[1:03:38] want to do the right things because it's
[1:03:42] got to come from in here
[1:03:43] we can sit here listen you sit here and
[1:03:45] you you can't save your kids you can't
[1:03:49] save your wife you fat you can't save
[1:03:50] nobody but if you'll live it long enough
[1:03:53] of a life before them and they walk up
[1:03:57] to that fountain and see that you've got
[1:03:59] something bubbling up inside of you that
[1:04:01] the common world does not have what
[1:04:05] brother Dale's always said he says can
[1:04:09] our family really see that we're
[1:04:12] different can they really see that
[1:04:16] you're committed to what you're doing if
[1:04:20] you're not committed then they're gonna
[1:04:21] see it they're gonna see it whether you
[1:04:26] think you're fooling them or not like I
[1:04:29] told you about many times you know Jim's
[1:04:31] dad when I got converted there was a lot
[1:04:33] of going on saying well he'll be right
[1:04:35] back to what he was doing before
[1:04:36] well that's been 20 years ago so I think
[1:04:40] we're okay
[1:04:41] but they're watching you to see if
[1:04:45] that's just oh one of them trends you
[1:04:47] know he used to test us remember he'd
[1:04:52] come to our come to businesses always on
[1:04:54] Sunday right Jim always he come Saturday
[1:04:57] night always on Sunday why he wanted to
[1:04:59] test us we never missed church because
[1:05:03] we had her daddy in the house never
[1:05:07] I don't see how some of you can do that
[1:05:09] I know you kids are important but your
[1:05:11] souls more important than that and
[1:05:12] they're watching you now Jim's dad comes
[1:05:17] to church with us when he's here because
[1:05:19] he knows he's gonna send it home by
[1:05:20] itself if you do that few kids they
[1:05:24] might get saved but when you stay home
[1:05:27] with them on Sunday just say they watch
[1:05:32] every move we make because we are
[1:05:34] different the community watches
[1:05:37] everything you do and listen most of
[1:05:40] them want to see you slip up because
[1:05:45] they're searching for something to catch
[1:05:48] you with but don't worry if you're
[1:05:52] washed by the water of the word and you
[1:05:53] keep that thing stirred up inside of you
[1:05:57] there will not be a lull in your
[1:06:01] Christianity amen there won't be folks I
[1:06:06] mean that's what people looking for and
[1:06:07] you know what you might be brother man
[1:06:10] said just be real salty remember what he
[1:06:12] told us that's sister said be real salty
[1:06:14] what about a man that walks in and plays
[1:06:17] and pretends to be drunk and he knocks
[1:06:19] all the food off of the table because
[1:06:20] his friend he said watch this watch my
[1:06:22] wife said she got she didn't pick
[1:06:26] the plate up and hit the guy with it
[1:06:28] she picked everything up and said must
[1:06:31] Jesus bear the cross alone and all the
[1:06:35] world go free saved her husband and her
[1:06:38] friend because what happened
[1:06:43] just what's rain we've been talking
[1:06:46] about revivals you go stand out under a
[1:06:49] water and you're gonna get wet hey man
[1:06:54] you go stand on the water you're gonna
[1:06:56] get wet our problem is we put the number
[1:07:00] a lot
[1:07:03] let's finish reading this will no get
[1:07:05] done broken system you don't have to
[1:07:12] depend on local range to fill it up
[1:07:14] rains or revivals we're that fountain
[1:07:18] that's at that fountain of life
[1:07:21] where the carcass no what's the carcass
[1:07:22] the word where the word is the Eagles we
[1:07:24] gather you don't have to pump up a
[1:07:26] revival you don't have to pump up
[1:07:28] nothing it'll just come right straight
[1:07:32] out it'll flow right out of you let's go
[1:07:36] to the next one
[1:07:38] Tom's one verse to bless it is a man who
[1:07:43] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:07:44] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:07:46] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[1:07:48] scornful but his delight is in the law
[1:07:51] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[1:07:52] meditate day and night it's what I was
[1:07:54] talking about I know there's a lot of
[1:07:56] things that we have to do but my heaven
[1:07:58] John and Charles Wesley that was 17 kids
[1:08:02] in that family she did not have a
[1:08:04] washing machine she didn't have a
[1:08:06] microwave she didn't go to Walmart buy
[1:08:08] instant dinners for their kids she
[1:08:11] cooked 17 meals two or three times a day
[1:08:14] but she had enough time to sit down and
[1:08:16] teach them kids about God in that John
[1:08:19] and Charles Wesley came out of that
[1:08:20] which caused a revival across the whole
[1:08:23] world and he shall be like a tree
[1:08:25] planted by the rivers of water now we've
[1:08:28] covered this before we're gonna cover a
[1:08:29] little bit more that bringeth forth his
[1:08:31] fruit in his season he should be like a
[1:08:38] tree planted by the rivers of water that
[1:08:39] bringeth forth his fruit the fruits of
[1:08:43] the Spirit love joy peace long-suffering
[1:08:45] wisdom faith all those different things
[1:08:47] that we look at his leaf also shall not
[1:08:50] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:08:52] prosper now remember we talked about the
[1:08:55] other day the whole world can be in a
[1:08:59] can being a famine or being a drought
[1:09:01] but whatever is planted by that River
[1:09:03] it's going to be green so if we get
[1:09:07] ourselves planted by the rivers of
[1:09:09] living water now what brother but I'm
[1:09:11] talking about this watch number 5
[1:09:13] planting the vine and where to plant it
[1:09:14] now are you planted by the rivers of
[1:09:17] water what water that's smitten Christ
[1:09:19] it was out of the rock floodwaters to
[1:09:21] save a perishing people from death
[1:09:23] Christ was smitten and out of his body
[1:09:25] come forth the Holy Spirit that
[1:09:27] perishing people might not die but have
[1:09:29] eternal life are you there's many
[1:09:31] different things God promised to heal he
[1:09:33] was wounded for
[1:09:34] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[1:09:36] chest eye chastisement our peace upon
[1:09:39] him with his stripes we were healed
[1:09:41] rivers rivers of one water don't get
[1:09:47] hurt by this rivers of one water the
[1:09:52] Holy Spirit there are first apostles
[1:09:54] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[1:09:56] rivers of one water you get a fountain
[1:10:02] you get rivers five rivers the only way
[1:10:07] you're going to get it it's through
[1:10:08] those five rivers apostles prophets
[1:10:11] pastors teachers and evangelists the
[1:10:13] Bible says in Ephesians what for the
[1:10:15] perfecting of the saints we know that
[1:10:17] here but somebody may be listening in
[1:10:19] that has a question about things that go
[1:10:21] up on up north but their first apostles
[1:10:24] prophets teachers evangelists pastors
[1:10:26] rivers of one water listen folks you're
[1:10:30] deceived if you can't see that you need
[1:10:33] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:10:35] evangelists
[1:10:36] you're to see person cuz you gotta take
[1:10:38] that part out of the Bible you can't get
[1:10:41] perfected without it
[1:10:42] like I said we're heard animals were
[1:10:44] sheep all of us are sheep we need a
[1:10:47] shepherd we have the great Shepherd but
[1:10:50] he said the great Shepherd is water one
[1:10:53] water our great Shepherd is the Holy
[1:10:56] Spirit remember God sent the Holy Spirit
[1:10:57] what leads you and guide you into all
[1:10:59] truth but he flowed it down through and
[1:11:01] I'll read you a quote here in just a
[1:11:02] little while it may be this evening
[1:11:04] where it flows now not through the
[1:11:06] church but through you it flows through
[1:11:12] you will read that maybe this afternoon
[1:11:14] if we get to it all right look
[1:11:17] revelations 1 verse 15 this is just kind
[1:11:20] of the other day we were going through
[1:11:21] this and and even just dressed her black
[1:11:28] thanking me for preaching on logs he's
[1:11:34] hidden his hair was white as wool it's
[1:11:37] white as snow and his eyes was flames of
[1:11:38] fire and what does this revelation is
[1:11:40] 115 John turns and looks and what does
[1:11:43] he see he sees in the midst of the seven
[1:11:45] golden candlesticks are the midst of the
[1:11:47] seven churches
[1:11:48] he sees a man with these characteristics
[1:11:50] and his feet like unto fine brass I said
[1:11:53] we're burning the furnace and his voice
[1:11:55] as the sound of many waters
[1:11:58] all right brother Brown says in the seal
[1:12:00] of God this is number six I want you to
[1:12:04] watch this now this great subject we had
[1:12:07] last night the first night was the
[1:12:09] church in the church age that was seeing
[1:12:12] Jesus standing in the midst of the seven
[1:12:13] golden candlesticks look upon his Jasper
[1:12:16] and sardine stone the beginning and the
[1:12:17] ending Reuben and Benjamin see the seven
[1:12:20] candlesticks were seven lampstands
[1:12:21] standing in a rainbow over it as the
[1:12:23] Covenant how he was how appeared and his
[1:12:27] voice was the voice of many waters
[1:12:30] both Christ and the church speaking
[1:12:32] together with a golden girdle around
[1:12:35] about the breast part of the church
[1:12:37] covered over feminists holding the
[1:12:41] gospel holding the righteousness of
[1:12:43] Christ over the church how can we fail
[1:12:46] when we have the righteousness of Christ
[1:12:49] were robed in His righteousness all
[1:12:51] right now look at number seven brother
[1:12:55] I'm stone but now now remember you got
[1:12:58] to watch what he talks about the church
[1:13:00] and the bride because at that moment

[1:13:03] talking about the bride not the church
[1:13:04] nominal everybody got that say man lord

[1:13:31] and his feet like brass it is hot in
[1:13:34] here burned in the furnace and his voice
[1:13:37] the sound of many waters hello Brown
[1:13:39] says voice of many waters walk this
[1:13:40] waters represent now remember rain and
[1:13:43] water is a revival we don't we just saw
[1:13:46] that nobody got that say man if you want
[1:13:49] to mark it down turn to revelation 17 15
[1:13:51] you find the Bible said the waters which
[1:13:53] thou sawest is thickness and multitudes
[1:13:54] and people in tongues all right voice
[1:13:56] what a horrible thing for a drifting
[1:13:59] soul on the sea of life no pilot
[1:14:01] goddamn you know we were talking the
[1:14:03] other day about that little rudder on
[1:14:04] the back of the boat loose floating with
[1:14:06] the tides to hear the roar of the great
[1:14:08] cataracts the Falls what a horrible
[1:14:10] thing would be for a soul drifting voice
[1:14:13] of many waters what is his voice it's
[1:14:15] the judgment the voice of the ministers
[1:14:19] hmm through the Holy Spirit you got to
[1:14:23] put them two together
[1:14:24] there's ministers that preach but
[1:14:27] there's ministers that preached by the
[1:14:28] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:14:31] cried out to the people in every age
[1:14:34] standing there the voice of many waters
[1:14:37] cried out to what to the thickness and
[1:14:40] multitude to the people the voice of
[1:14:42] those seven stars in his hand to every
[1:14:44] church age preaching the baptism of the
[1:14:46] Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus name
[1:14:48] speaking in tongues the power of God the
[1:14:49] resurrection of Christ the second coming
[1:14:52] divine judgement the voice of many
[1:14:53] waters came forth from this one that
[1:14:56] looked like the Son of Man many waters
[1:15:01] if I got that say man now we'll watch
[1:15:05] this this is in the layout of CN Church
[1:15:07] age I just picked this up a few minutes
[1:15:09] ago let's read this let's read the whole
[1:15:11] quote because we get the whole thought a
[1:15:13] momentary consideration now remember
[1:15:15] this is Laodicean Church age this is the
[1:15:17] only Church age where Jesus Christ has
[1:15:20] been put out of the church he's standing
[1:15:23] on the outside of the church trying to
[1:15:25] get back in and eyeball as I've always
[1:15:28] said for some of you that are new and
[1:15:30] are you need to hear this because look
[1:15:35] who was that standing on the outside of
[1:15:37] the church
[1:15:39] guarding human flesh Dease on a man not
[1:15:44] a spirit Holy Spirit still in the church
[1:15:50] but the son of man is not in the church
[1:15:53] anymore that's not a man he's been
[1:15:55] driven out and he's trying to get back
[1:15:57] in I'm doing my message churches and
[1:15:59] specially them out there we've got to
[1:16:02] get the revelation that God in human
[1:16:04] flesh is here now listen an open door is
[1:16:09] an open book a closed door it's a closed
[1:16:14] book
[1:16:15] they closed him out to let the real
[1:16:20] revival start in the people which is a
[1:16:23] word revival and the Dark Ages the word
[1:16:26] was almost entirely lost to the people
[1:16:29] but God sent Luther with the word now
[1:16:31] remember Luther couldn't start a revival
[1:16:36] like a word revival that works because
[1:16:39] it was the book was closed the just
[1:16:41] shall live by faith that's all he had
[1:16:43] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[1:16:46] Amen God sealed in the under Martin
[1:16:52] Luther got sealed in a group of bride
[1:16:54] that received the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:57] Ghost but it was under a closed book it
[1:16:59] was not under an open book never I
[1:17:02] understand that there was only a certain
[1:17:04] scripture that they had that they went
[1:17:06] in on because listen even though God
[1:17:10] winked at the ignorance of the people he
[1:17:14] never never ever condones false doctrine
[1:17:20] he allows it to happen
[1:17:23] brother Brown says because the ignorance
[1:17:25] of the people God said okay but Luther's
[1:17:29] message was the just shall live by faith
[1:17:31] which was God's mind coming to Martin
[1:17:34] Luther to bring a people out of the
[1:17:36] Catholic Church but they still baptize
[1:17:38] wrong they still had a wrong doctrine of
[1:17:41] the Trinity but God winked that there
[1:17:42] Ignace because it was a closed book it
[1:17:44] was only open to one page the just shall
[1:17:49] live by faith and that's not a full word
[1:17:51] revival that is a what remember they
[1:17:53] were reformers they were reformers it
[1:17:58] started a restoration but Luther Wesley
[1:18:00] were reformers because what they did is
[1:18:02] they reformed the people out of the
[1:18:05] Catholic Church Wesley reformed the
[1:18:07] people out of the Lutheran's that had
[1:18:09] went back toward the Kevlar dock to
[1:18:11] Catholic doctrine but when you see
[1:18:12] whether Branham comes in the end time
[1:18:14] it's not it's a restoration
[1:18:20] I will restore I will turn the heart of
[1:18:23] the father's back to the children and
[1:18:25] the children back to the fathers where
[1:18:27] you're living under not not just Luther
[1:18:31] and Wesley that's part of the foundation
[1:18:34] but that was Reformation you and I
[1:18:37] cannot live under Reformation you're not
[1:18:41] even born again if you live under
[1:18:44] Reformation those Luther's Luther's
[1:18:48] doctrine was that the just shall live by
[1:18:50] faith I can go to the beer joint and I
[1:18:53] can smoke a stogie and talk about God
[1:18:55] God winked at her Ignis they could do
[1:18:57] that not in this age you can't do that
[1:18:58] why because the books been open the full
[1:19:01] revelation is that that's a part of God
[1:19:03] justification but you got to move from
[1:19:06] that into sanctification you got to move
[1:19:08] from that to the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:19:10] why because the word has been restored
[1:19:12] full and unadulterated by the Prophet in
[1:19:15] the end time everybody got that say man
[1:19:18] that's just real simple the Lutheran's
[1:19:22] speak for God at that time but they
[1:19:25] organize look and again the pure Word
[1:19:28] was lost for organization tends toward
[1:19:31] dogmas and creeds and not simple word
[1:19:33] they could no longer speak for God at
[1:19:37] one time they were but God moved on and
[1:19:39] they didn't then God sent Wesley and he
[1:19:42] was the voice of the word for his day
[1:19:45] the people who took his revelation from
[1:19:48] God became the living epistle read and
[1:19:52] known of all men for their generation
[1:19:54] when the Methodists failed God raised up
[1:19:58] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:20:00] years until in this last day there is
[1:20:04] again another people in the land who
[1:20:09] under their messenger will be the final
[1:20:11] voice to the final age final voice under
[1:20:17] her messenger Luther's message was not
[1:20:21] final because it was Reformation
[1:20:24] Wesley's message was not final
[1:20:26] information even Pentecost with the
[1:20:30] restoration the gifts not final
[1:20:34] you and I are the final boys to the
[1:20:38] final age what the voice of many waters
[1:20:40] the voice of many people yes sir look
[1:20:45] the church now he's so much the church
[1:20:47] you know I'm with the bride the church
[1:20:49] is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is
[1:20:53] its own mouthpiece so God is turning on
[1:20:57] her what the church he will confound her
[1:21:00] through the Prophet and the bride they
[1:21:05] didn't just say the Prophet he will
[1:21:09] confound her through the Prophet and the
[1:21:11] bride for the voice of God will be in
[1:21:15] her yes it is for it says in the last
[1:21:20] chapter of revelation 17 the spirit and
[1:21:22] the bride say come you ever read that in
[1:21:25] the Bible right there - Brienne it says
[1:21:27] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:21:30] once more the world will hear direct
[1:21:33] from God as that Pentecost but of course
[1:21:36] that word bride would come at the word
[1:21:38] revival that word bride will be
[1:21:40] repudiated as in the first church age
[1:21:43] now he has cried out to this lass age
[1:21:46] you have the word you have more Bibles
[1:21:50] than ever but you're not doing anything
[1:21:53] about the word except dividing and
[1:21:55] hacking it into pieces hmm you can't
[1:22:01] hack a word revival up a word revival is
[1:22:04] restore is restoring of the to Word of
[1:22:06] God pure and unadulterated through the
[1:22:08] voice of the bride in the end time look
[1:22:13] taking what you want and leaving out
[1:22:17] what you don't want your interest you
[1:22:21] are not interested in living it but
[1:22:23] debating it Wow hmm I would sooner you
[1:22:29] were cold or hot if you were cold and
[1:22:31] rejected it I can say that if you get
[1:22:35] white heart to know its truth and live
[1:22:36] it I would praise you for that but when
[1:22:39] you simply take my word and don't honor
[1:22:41] it I in return must refuse to honor you
[1:22:44] I will spew you out for you
[1:22:47] nauseate me Wow for you nauseate me
[1:22:52] that's pretty tough for a prophet to say
[1:22:55] those words but what are we doing in the
[1:22:59] end time about it hmm
[1:23:01] let's go to John 7 verse 37 and the last
[1:23:05] day that great day of the feast Jesus
[1:23:07] stood in the last day the last day he
[1:23:11] must be done about somebody the last day
[1:23:13] that great day of the feast Jesus stood
[1:23:18] and cried and said if any man thirst let
[1:23:20] him come unto me and drink he that
[1:23:22] believeth on me as the scripture has
[1:23:24] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[1:23:26] of living water rivers of living water
[1:23:32] what it rivers of life alright let's go
[1:23:35] to number 8 getting in the spirit this
[1:23:37] is what we tell them I till today that's
[1:23:39] the way you get a revival when you
[1:23:41] really get in the spirit of revival it's
[1:23:43] what I've been trying to get you know
[1:23:45] you need the rudder you're in the water
[1:23:48] everything's good you're in the water
[1:23:50] but what if you know the winds of
[1:23:52] sickness blows you this way the winds of
[1:23:56] this blows you that way that's okay but
[1:23:59] if you got if you don't have a rudder
[1:24:01] you just might get blown all the way off
[1:24:02] into the end of the falls but if you got
[1:24:05] a little bitty thing called a rudder
[1:24:06] they put about that long on a little
[1:24:08] boat even on a huge boat it's not very
[1:24:10] big but what does it do it's a rudder
[1:24:14] and it doesn't matter if the winds
[1:24:16] blowing in that direction if you put
[1:24:17] that rudder in there that'll boat make
[1:24:19] like they're little ways but it's gonna
[1:24:20] go the way that rudder says for it to go
[1:24:22] and that rudder is your Holy Ghost that
[1:24:25] will lead you and guide you direct you
[1:24:27] into all truth that's the way you get a
[1:24:30] revivalist when you're really getting in
[1:24:31] the spirit of revival not whooping it up
[1:24:33] or something
[1:24:34] but by praying it down until there's a
[1:24:36] revival strikes your heart here's what
[1:24:39] we talked about the other day until all
[1:24:40] the logs of ecclesiasticus ISM and all
[1:24:43] the logs of fanaticism and all the laws
[1:24:44] of system and all logs of unbelief flow
[1:24:46] out and then the water of God comes
[1:24:48] falling down upon you there you are I
[1:24:50] didn't bring something out the other day
[1:24:52] when I was preaching here but I preached
[1:24:53] the same thing your brother Duchess and
[1:24:55] it struck me you know what logs are
[1:24:59] there is never a live log a log is dead
[1:25:06] if you see a log laying in the woods its
[1:25:10] dead if you see its tree standing up
[1:25:12] it's alive but if you cut the life out
[1:25:14] of it and it falls it becomes log hmm a
[1:25:21] log is dead so whatever your ideas are
[1:25:26] that's clogging up your water it's dead
[1:25:31] you know what it's dead wood and you
[1:25:33] can't even build a fire with it it's
[1:25:35] soaked with water it's wet but if you
[1:25:39] need a fire here we go getting in the
[1:25:43] spirit he said it was out there one time
[1:25:46] perishing in the same way that you are
[1:25:48] now there's channels out there's plenty
[1:25:50] of channels will that rock still lays in
[1:25:52] the wilderness young to me he said you
[1:25:54] got to dig out a lot of stuff remember
[1:25:56] he's told my little ID you're Elijah
[1:25:57] talking about digging ditches in the
[1:25:59] Bible remember what happened they dug he
[1:26:02] did they dug ditches and filter that
[1:26:03] with water and then when the enemy got
[1:26:05] up in the morning and looked out across
[1:26:07] the field they saw that water and the
[1:26:10] way the Sun was shining on it looked
[1:26:12] like blood they thought that the
[1:26:14] somebody had come in and destroyed their
[1:26:16] enemy so they go rushing in the Campbell
[1:26:17] when they do they're waiting on them the
[1:26:19] Israelites are waiting on them they kill
[1:26:20] them all they killed the other group
[1:26:21] right so watch brother Brad I'm saying
[1:26:24] it ain't starting new organization
[1:26:26] that's the vision tonight brother just
[1:26:29] dig out what's in it that's right the
[1:26:31] first thing that old rotten log of
[1:26:33] organization throw it out of the channel
[1:26:35] the channels of God blessing is all
[1:26:37] stopped up tonight organization logs
[1:26:40] laying in them then another log laying
[1:26:43] out there called the no such thing of
[1:26:45] the Holy Ghost if you dig down and
[1:26:47] struck that log throw it out what we
[1:26:50] were talking about remember sister
[1:26:51] Sheppard's dream even with the baptism
[1:26:54] of the Holy Ghost there was a man
[1:26:55] pouring water in that top it went down
[1:26:58] into the person and what came out trash
[1:27:03] dead sticks
[1:27:05] dead logs a man came out with us a
[1:27:09] statue a perfect man that's our problem
[1:27:11] if we're a born again strike that
[1:27:12] you don't have logs in your soul there
[1:27:15] is nothing dead in your soul if you're
[1:27:17] born again you're alive you're that tree
[1:27:20] that's planted by the rivers of living
[1:27:21] water you listen to those five rivers of
[1:27:24] a possible profit bachelor's teaching
[1:27:25] and evangelist and that what that nurse
[1:27:28] is your soul there's no such a thing as
[1:27:33] about this one throw it out if you dig
[1:27:35] down instruct that Locke throw it out
[1:27:36] there's no such thing as the baptism all
[1:27:37] the ghosts that's just for the disciples
[1:27:39] only dig it out the only ghost was just
[1:27:42] for the apostle dr. Simon Peter said on
[1:27:45] the day of Pentecost is for you and for
[1:27:46] your children them too far off what do
[1:27:48] you do he took them back to the Bible
[1:27:49] great fine Pentecostal brother told me
[1:27:52] not long ago said we don't need any more
[1:27:53] divine healing I wouldn't even let it be
[1:27:56] practiced in my church
[1:27:57] he said we got fine doctors and things
[1:27:59] today that takes the place of that
[1:28:00] that's what I told y'all the other day
[1:28:02] we got doctors so you know divine
[1:28:05] healing we need divine healing you can't
[1:28:07] take it out of the atonement that's in
[1:28:08] there but do we have to depend on that
[1:28:12] for your soul survival no no your soul
[1:28:18] soul depends on the Word of God Jesus
[1:28:24] told them said don't worry about the guy
[1:28:25] that can kill your body
[1:28:26] he said worry about that guy that can
[1:28:28] kill your soul mm-hmm see what what kind
[1:28:32] of an old log gets in there what does it
[1:28:34] do this stops the flow of the water
[1:28:36] Elijah's vision showed him that out
[1:28:38] there in that wilderness right where the
[1:28:40] fruit was dried up don't start in your
[1:28:43] organization another rain or something
[1:28:44] just clean out the channels where the
[1:28:46] first rain can flow the waters there
[1:28:49] listen if you're not today let me tell
[1:28:52] you how you get into a revival a word
[1:28:54] revival is you remember when you got
[1:28:55] born again how fresh and new you don't
[1:29:02] want to do anything but listening to
[1:29:03] tapes read books talk to brothers come
[1:29:05] to church if you're not doing that now
[1:29:08] revive what that was before that means
[1:29:12] you're in a revival get back to those
[1:29:15] simple things the waters there across
[1:29:17] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:29:19] that spit and rock was a wilderness
[1:29:20] still here tonight thank God Jesus
[1:29:22] cleaned it out for them at Calvary but
[1:29:25] they came right back
[1:29:26] around and throughout the logs back in
[1:29:28] blocked off all you know what it doesn't
[1:29:30] throw a log in a channel what does it
[1:29:34] well then all kind of dirt hits against
[1:29:36] the log and washes up the first thing
[1:29:38] you know you get all the water backed up
[1:29:40] like the beavers do and make a dam and
[1:29:42] you get nothing to go through it that's
[1:29:44] right we got too many beaver preachers
[1:29:47] today trying to dam all the water up and
[1:29:52] say this is ours this is just us here
[1:29:56] this belongs to us and what happens to
[1:29:59] it it becomes stagnated now it's water
[1:30:02] but it's not flowing water rivers of
[1:30:05] living water
[1:30:07] it doesn't say puddles puddles get
[1:30:13] stagnant rivers of living water
[1:30:17] I remain I you know back my brother
[1:30:19] Brandon was coming up you could really
[1:30:22] stop by the creek and pick you up a
[1:30:24] little bit of water and drink it because
[1:30:25] it came through all the rocks and all
[1:30:27] the things and it was purified you may
[1:30:29] not be able do that now because the man
[1:30:30] but it really is that's the best water
[1:30:33] there is its water that's cool water
[1:30:37] right out of a stream it becomes
[1:30:39] stagnated that's what's the matter with
[1:30:40] a lot of our organizations trying to
[1:30:42] back up the water for your organization
[1:30:44] it gets stagnated stagnated we don't
[1:30:50] want it to be stagnated we want that
[1:30:51] water that first saved us we want it to
[1:30:55] continue to flow freely we want to be
[1:30:58] able to sure how the gifts of God and
[1:31:00] all the different things live the life
[1:31:03] before others but do we really want a
[1:31:11] word revival do we really want not just
[1:31:16] the do's and don'ts but we want the word
[1:31:18] revival to where the word remember what
[1:31:21] I told many times before you think about
[1:31:23] this when Jesus walked on the earth he
[1:31:26] was God Almighty in human flesh right a
[1:31:29] man he was God Almighty in human flesh
[1:31:34] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:31:37] okay one man but now he has given to us
[1:31:42] and now we're God in human flesh walking
[1:31:46] on the face of the earth and the Word
[1:31:48] was made flesh and dwelt among us you
[1:31:50] and I are God made flesh we are God made
[1:31:53] manifest in another form so what are we
[1:31:56] to do act like it never was a time when
[1:32:01] Jesus like I said before Jesus didn't
[1:32:02] get up in the morning but mill today you
[1:32:04] come into the disciples and he said man
[1:32:06] I've had a problem with my daddy all day
[1:32:08] we've been disagreeing all evening
[1:32:11] he never said that vote he said I only
[1:32:14] do that what the father showed me so it
[1:32:16] had to be the Word of God listen
[1:32:19] Jesus's life was built around what that
[1:32:22] Old Testament said about him
[1:32:25] there was no New Testament he was
[1:32:27] writing the New Testament in his life
[1:32:29] but he lived the Old Testament that one
[1:32:33] quote on the great day of the feast you
[1:32:35] remember there was three feast that
[1:32:37] every Israelite boy man had to attend I
[1:32:41] can't remember mo but there's three of
[1:32:43] them all the time it says and the day of
[1:32:47] the feast Jesus was in the temple he
[1:32:50] didn't not do what the law said even
[1:32:54] when the leper was healed and all the
[1:32:56] different things he say go show yourself
[1:32:58] to the priest you go do the law of Moses
[1:33:01] remember he came under the law he
[1:33:04] fulfilled the law and then made that law
[1:33:08] live told somebody well you know you
[1:33:18] drop by and you're looking you see this
[1:33:20] big sinus it's got the ten commandments
[1:33:22] and you got all the Ten Commandments and
[1:33:25] the guy sitting on the porch drinking
[1:33:26] the beer smoking cigarette I mean what
[1:33:31] is that it's not a word revival you and
[1:33:34] I know better but that's what God
[1:33:40] promised what happened let's go here
[1:33:42] we'll quit right here we'll start this
[1:33:44] afternoon mmm we're gonna read this set
[1:33:48] of stage for this afternoon all right
[1:33:49] Amos eight let's go back to a mistake
[1:33:51] verse 11 behold the days come saith the
[1:33:56] Lord that I will send a famine in the
[1:33:57] land not a famine of bread and a thirst
[1:33:59] for water but of hearing the words of
[1:34:01] the Lord and they shall wander from sea
[1:34:03] to sea from North even to the east and
[1:34:05] they shall run to and fro and seek the
[1:34:07] word of the Lord and shall not find it
[1:34:09] in that day shall the fair virgins and
[1:34:12] young men faint for thirst let's see
[1:34:15] what family means the word family in the
[1:34:17] Greek lexicon or Hebrew lexicon means
[1:34:19] hunger famine in the land or of
[1:34:24] Jehovah's word figuratively which is
[1:34:26] that's what it is because we have no
[1:34:27] hunger we know you're not hungry today
[1:34:29] if you're hungry today in a few minutes
[1:34:31] you're fixing to go get some food stores
[1:34:33] will be open you won't have to go down
[1:34:36] there and ration it out it's gonna be
[1:34:38] right there for you so it's a famine of
[1:34:42] hearing the Word of God
[1:34:44] lack of food famine in the land and the
[1:34:49] nation and famine of Jehovah's word
[1:34:52] figuratively there's four things a
[1:34:59] famine does anybody read listen to this
[1:35:03] and we'll stop and just as a ghetto guy
[1:35:05] you know eat and get more sleepy for the
[1:35:07] afternoon number one a famine moves
[1:35:13] people think about it who ever wanted to
[1:35:18] stay in a famine ridden land and I'll
[1:35:21] read it to you by four scriptures Ruth
[1:35:23] Abram David and Elisha a famine moves
[1:35:27] people number two it's because of a lack
[1:35:32] of water rain revival during the time of
[1:35:41] famine nothing growth there's no growth
[1:35:44] that's where you going logs from all
[1:35:47] that dead stuff and number four it kills
[1:35:53] things
[1:35:56] there's nothing live in the family it's
[1:35:59] all dead so now let's go to Genesis
[1:36:02] 12:10 just I'm gonna read you these four
[1:36:04] and then we'll stop right here
[1:36:07] this is 1210 and there was a famine in
[1:36:09] the land I read how many times have you
[1:36:11] eaten going through the Bible put in the
[1:36:13] word famine there's like 86 times every
[1:36:15] time you see a family and somebody moved
[1:36:17] alright there was a famine in the land
[1:36:20] and Abram went down to Egypt now I
[1:36:24] didn't bring the quote but brother Brown
[1:36:25] said that was Abraham's mistake he left
[1:36:28] the Promised Land because he thought he
[1:36:32] could find food somewhere else so he
[1:36:33] goes into Egypt he gives his wife away
[1:36:35] and all these different things totally
[1:36:36] gets out of the will of God but he moves
[1:36:38] now watch Ruth Ruth 1 verse 1 now it
[1:36:42] came to pass in the days when the judges
[1:36:43] ruled that there was a famine in the
[1:36:45] land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[1:36:48] Judah went to sojourn in the country of
[1:36:50] Moab he and his wife know who is this
[1:36:54] this is Naomi and her husband and her
[1:36:57] two sons as soon as they went down to
[1:37:00] wherever they were going to they died
[1:37:05] now we know for one thing's for sure if
[1:37:08] they hadn't went down there Ruth
[1:37:09] wouldn't come into being but there was a
[1:37:11] famine and they moved in the two sons
[1:37:14] and remember all the three sons the two
[1:37:16] sons and the husband died all right
[1:37:18] let's go to 2nd Samuel 21 then there was
[1:37:22] a famine in the days of David three
[1:37:24] years year after year and David inquired
[1:37:26] of the Lord and the Lord answered him
[1:37:28] said this is why you're having a famine
[1:37:30] it is for Saul and for his bloody house
[1:37:33] because he slew the Gibeonites Saul done
[1:37:37] something wrong God closed a family to
[1:37:39] come into Lynn first King 17 we'll get
[1:37:42] to these this afternoon we'll explain
[1:37:44] each one Elijah the Tishbite who is of
[1:37:47] the inhabitants of Gilead Senator Ahab
[1:37:49] as the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[1:37:50] whom I stand there shall not be do
[1:37:52] listen you can stand something when
[1:37:55] there's new on the ground a little
[1:37:57] something will grow member especially
[1:37:59] down here in the south you come outside
[1:38:00] in the morning especially in changing
[1:38:03] the seasons like we're coming to and the
[1:38:05] grounds just wet would do no do no rain
[1:38:10] and we know for three and a half years
[1:38:11] it didn't be said according to my word
[1:38:14] now what happened is musicians come what
[1:38:19] happened Elijah went to a widow woman
[1:38:23] and right in the middle of a famine God
[1:38:29] gave her plenty he said you bring me the
[1:38:35] last bit of foods you got the famine was
[1:38:39] so sore nothing grilled everything was
[1:38:41] dead she had just enough oil in just
[1:38:45] enough meal to make one cake and bacon
[1:38:48] you know brother branham explains all
[1:38:49] that we'll get into that this afternoon
[1:38:50] bake that cake and Dana she didn't need
[1:38:55] it she gave it to Elijah she obeyed the
[1:39:00] word of the Lord
[1:39:01] so disobeyed the word of the Lord and
[1:39:04] stayed in the famine for three years
[1:39:06] this lady this woman that this Elijah
[1:39:12] come to in the midst of a famine that
[1:39:16] lady if you'll do this for me
[1:39:18] your crews will never run dry every time
[1:39:22] you reach down and get a meal out of the
[1:39:25] barrel it'll appear right back again
[1:39:28] until this famine is over you'll not
[1:39:32] have a famine you'll live in the midst
[1:39:34] of this thing so a famine wait now a
[1:39:41] famine is bad but when the family moves
[1:39:46] you to the right place because what it
[1:39:50] is it's not a famine now for food
[1:39:52] physical food it's for the Word of God
[1:39:54] and if God moves you to a place where
[1:39:57] the Word of God is shunammite woman he
[1:40:00] is sustaining you during a time of
[1:40:02] famine promised over the whole world the
[1:40:08] worst famine has ever been is a famine
[1:40:10] for here in the Word of God list and
[1:40:22] that woman got down to her last one cup
[1:40:26] of meal and one little cup of oil to
[1:40:31] bake that one last cake she was right in
[1:40:35] the midst of the famine not at the end
[1:40:37] of it
[1:40:38] and she met Elijah and Elijah told her
[1:40:46] doesn't matter what goes on out in this
[1:40:48] world doesn't matter now there's already
[1:40:51] been condemnation in this world you
[1:40:54] don't worry about it though because you
[1:40:56] and your household will be saved you and
[1:41:01] your household will sustain life in the
[1:41:03] middle of this because what have you
[1:41:05] done you've found the water of living
[1:41:09] water of life and you're drawing from
[1:41:11] that you and I today draw from that
[1:41:14] water it's living water I've never seen
[1:41:20] anybody oh yeah you can drown but
[1:41:24] remember you can do without food for a
[1:41:26] long time but you can't do without water
[1:41:27] but just for a week or maybe seven ten
[1:41:29] maybe days water has life in it
[1:41:34] river of water there's a river of life
[1:41:38] flowing out through each and every one
[1:41:40] of us has the Elijah spoke to you folks
[1:41:43] I'm asking you that has Elijah spoke to
[1:41:46] you and told you don't worry about that

[1:41:55] bring it through rivers five rivers of
[1:42:00] living water through five streams and
[1:42:03] it's going to sustain you through this
[1:42:05] dry land that they call the world that
[1:42:09] we live in you and I have been called
[1:42:12] out by nee Elijah prophet in the end
[1:42:15] time and he told us if you'll do what I
