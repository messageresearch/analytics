[11:19] amen see you more clearly every day huh
[11:24] the world is allowing us to say it more
[11:27] clearly because they're proven what they
[11:28] are
[11:29] but we're also going to prove who we are
[11:31] so yeah your
[11:33] brother kern let us watch that last
[11:36] night it was a
[11:38] pastor of a methodist church prayed over
[11:40] the house and sent it
[11:42] and he prayed to several gods
[11:46] one monotheism and one other one and
[11:48] allah and the other one and then he said
[11:50] amen and a woman
[11:52] at the end of the service how horrible
[11:55] that the place we've come to
[11:58] used to it meant something you know
[12:00] brother brown said our
[12:02] nation was founded on christian religion
[12:04] but boy
[12:05] somewhere she got off the path but we
[12:08] knew she would because she turned him
[12:09] down in 1956 she turned god down in 1956
[12:12] we believe what the prophet said she'll
[12:13] never come back
[12:14] amen and he said i believe she'll either
[12:16] take it or turn it down well you know
[12:18] what happened
[12:19] she turned it down she being this nation
[12:22] so um
[12:23] but you know what god's still blessing
[12:24] us i wouldn't live anywhere else
[12:27] wouldn't let sorry you can say him i
[12:29] wouldn't live anything i'd like to go to
[12:30] alaska maybe live in different parts but
[12:32] uh bro chris it'd be nice
[12:34] to go up there for a little while always
[12:36] told that i said
[12:38] you know if if the lord said now brother
[12:40] wait i need you to go to
[12:41] like nicaragua or somewhere i'm like
[12:43] well lord let's pray about this
[12:45] but but now if he said now once you go
[12:48] to alaska
[12:49] i'd be like that was you lord
[12:53] yeah but luis would be different he's
[12:56] cause he's going nicaragua yeah we'll
[12:58] get ready to go
[12:59] so it's just different i don't speak the
[13:02] language down there
[13:03] i can't speak their language so but good
[13:05] to be in house of lord good to be back
[13:07] we're going to start a new series i
[13:09] notice you if you'll notice i've got
[13:10] these little
[13:11] uh we will not be using it today because
[13:14] we're going to be before
[13:15] creation all right uh
[13:19] we were at the colleges last night and
[13:21] that we were talking about how that
[13:23] hey brother lewis brother bob brother
[13:25] william
[13:27] we seem to can't get out of genesis in
[13:28] revelation we can't seem to get out of
[13:31] the mind of god
[13:33] because when i started the series on the
[13:35] two spirits we went back in
[13:36] you know when satan was created or
[13:38] lucifer was created
[13:40] and so now we're going way on back
[13:43] and we're going to talk about eternal
[13:44] redemption
[13:46] and we're the only people in this world
[13:50] that know the right plan of redemption
[13:55] the bride of jesus christ taking the
[13:57] message of the hour
[13:58] from the prophet that said let's go back
[14:00] into the back part of god's mind
[14:03] and unveil it today in christ the
[14:05] mystery of god reveal
[14:08] i had already picked out the same quote
[14:10] brother louise read that long when he
[14:11] read wednesday night and i'd already
[14:13] picked parts of all those out so
[14:15] we're we're kind of all uh we're rowing
[14:18] in the same yeah it's hot
[14:19] jim can you turn the air on just push it
[14:23] all the way down where it says fan
[14:26] yep right over right there you have a
[14:29] new job now
[14:31] you can't say i don't know what to look
[14:32] for but we're all kind of rowing in the
[14:34] same
[14:36] direction i hope but we're always
[14:37] actually in the same water
[14:39] so listen it's for somebody
[14:43] it's got to be for us to keep circling
[14:45] around the same place i told y'all back
[14:47] in june or july when we
[14:49] when the a lot of new ones were coming
[14:50] in and being baptized and the kids have
[14:52] started
[14:53] young adults and started paying more
[14:55] attention
[14:56] to the to the message or to the to
[14:59] what's being preached
[15:00] i was remember i was praying and god i
[15:03] would say god we we can't leave these
[15:05] people behind and remember what the lord
[15:06] told me he said he
[15:08] i'm coming back to get him don't worry
[15:10] well
[15:11] listen you can only come back so many
[15:14] times
[15:16] because there's one time when god said
[15:18] that's it
[15:20] he played with them for 400 years they
[15:22] got to cadence bernie and god said you
[15:24] either are going to go in
[15:26] or are you going to die right here and a
[15:28] lot of them died
[15:29] so please don't die god has come to get
[15:32] us all
[15:33] he has looped back to get the ones that
[15:35] maybe i don't mean say slow in
[15:37] in in um
[15:40] man's knowledge but we're all slowing
[15:43] god's knowledge
[15:44] there's revelation we still need all of
[15:46] us brother dale's been 50 60 years in
[15:48] the message and they still revelation he
[15:50] needs
[15:51] so you know i'm not saying that i'm just
[15:53] saying some of us though
[15:55] some of us though come in kicking and
[15:56] screaming something comes in like you
[15:58] know when i
[15:59] i took math classes in school and man i
[16:02] love math and i could just
[16:03] get in it's like brother joe and i were
[16:05] talking about chess
[16:08] and i'm just going to say this is it's
[16:09] just it just came to me he said boy you
[16:12] get in the chat playing chess he said
[16:13] you know man it
[16:14] i said yeah luisa get into it he'd miss
[16:16] church to play play chess
[16:18] so but i mean every time there's a chess
[16:21] game going
[16:22] you know i go out and start doing
[16:23] something else digging a hole or working
[16:25] on a car that i don't know nothing about
[16:27] but brother luis will say yeah let's
[16:28] play chess we'll see that's the way it
[16:30] is with the word of god some
[16:32] are like that some wouldn't miss an
[16:36] opportunity to read the word of god
[16:38] listen to a tape
[16:39] fellowship with the brothers others
[16:40] would just say yeah i'm part of that but
[16:42] you'll go do something else
[16:43] okay so you just got you who's got to
[16:45] decide that
[16:47] you decide that amen so when it comes to
[16:49] the word of god it's the same way
[16:52] but today we're going to start on this
[16:55] redemption now we did this
[16:56] in a part i think brother joe i looked
[17:00] way on back it may have been like even
[17:02] 2005 or six
[17:04] or seven i did this and we we renovated
[17:07] this chart a couple of times since then
[17:10] but we're going to try to go through the
[17:11] complete plan of redemption but we're
[17:13] going to go
[17:14] and pull it out in pieces instead of
[17:17] just running through
[17:18] here because you you know we're going to
[17:19] take at the very end we'll run through
[17:20] every bit of this
[17:21] but when we get to the church ages we're
[17:23] going to see what
[17:25] paul taught irene has taught different
[17:27] ones we're going to see what
[17:28] moses did with the ten commandments as
[17:30] we were talking last night
[17:32] where the prophet of god called them the
[17:33] seals to those people
[17:35] and we're going to look at the old
[17:36] testament because listen every piece is
[17:38] a plan of redemption
[17:40] the old testament is part of the plan of
[17:43] redemption
[17:44] whether it didn't redeem one person like
[17:47] we are talking about redemption
[17:49] it was part of the redemption process
[17:51] amen because it was jehovah
[17:53] it was christ in moses
[17:56] christ in david remember
[17:59] and then we come to the fullness of the
[18:01] godhead body this brother dale's talking
[18:03] about we're going to just all intertwine
[18:04] again today too
[18:06] as we did this morning but you know what
[18:07] it does it keeps your mind fresh
[18:09] keeps your mind fresh when one brings it
[18:11] one way and one brings it another we're
[18:12] all going the same direction
[18:14] so also i'd like to announce that
[18:15] brother uh aaron will not be preaching
[18:17] for us anymore
[18:18] because he's not preaching on wednesday
[18:19] night and i gotta preach so he ain't
[18:21] preaching tomorrow
[18:24] this week no he's working late
[18:28] and i understand i told him i said well
[18:31] he said well i
[18:31] might not get there at 7 30. i said you
[18:33] don't start preaching at 7 30 anyway
[18:36] but he'll want to come in in this dirty
[18:37] clothes so bless his heart
[18:39] so i'll be doing sunday wednesday

[19:17] that will be serving for no ain't nobody
[19:20] younger than you look behind you buddy
[19:22] sorry
[19:24] all right i'm looking at you and also
[19:28] before we forget it this comes up on
[19:30] people just like christmas
[19:32] june the 17th through the 19th we have
[19:35] the lodge rented again
[19:38] you say that's in june don't worry a lot
[19:41] of you'll come up three days before and
[19:42] go
[19:43] oh it's father's day
[19:47] it's on the calendar but june the 17th
[19:50] through the 19th we'll be having our
[19:51] father's day
[19:52] fishing trip just like we did last year
[19:53] so just keep that
[19:55] in your mind and put that on your
[19:56] calendar also i will be doing brother
[19:58] chris long's gonna have a weekend
[20:01] uh easter service uh april the
[20:04] second third and fourth and i'll be
[20:05] doing it for him so just keep us in your
[20:08] prayers that kind of gets gets you
[20:09] caught up with everything so let's go to
[20:10] hebrews 9
[20:11] 11.
[20:17] and let's look why you know when you say
[20:20] eternal redemption boy you it really
[20:22] you say well you think of everlasting
[20:24] and all these different
[20:25] covenants redemption is not
[20:30] temporary now we won't need redemption
[20:34] as far as the new birth once you get the
[20:35] new birth but there still
[20:37] is it's going to carry with us the whole
[20:40] time
[20:42] we're going to realize brother chris
[20:44] that we were lost we're not going to get
[20:45] a future home and go
[20:46] oh i can't remember nothing no you're
[20:49] going to remember who you are where you
[20:51] came from
[20:52] but now the former things will be passed
[20:53] away the old things the things that hurt
[20:55] you the things that
[20:56] but you're going to remember all the
[20:58] good things amen
[21:00] and you'll remember because you know
[21:02] what when jesus when he walks up to us
[21:04] and holds his hands up like this
[21:06] you're going to see that that's eternal
[21:07] redemption because that body that's
[21:08] being made
[21:09] that has been made eternal is going to
[21:11] have scars still in it
[21:13] for an eternity amen so we're going to
[21:16] start with eternal redemption
[21:18] the plan part one let's bow our heads
[21:20] the heavenly father thank you for the
[21:22] day
[21:22] thank you for the words you give us
[21:24] already lord i pray that you would now
[21:26] anoint us for this journey for a little
[21:28] while lord that you would speak to your
[21:30] people
[21:31] you'd be the active participant in this
[21:32] service father you'd be the one that
[21:33] does the speaking
[21:35] father says anyone needs healing we pray
[21:36] that you'd heal their body lord
[21:38] number one though we pray that you'd
[21:40] heal the soul that you would take
[21:42] someone lord and take them through that
[21:44] new birth through justification
[21:45] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[21:47] and
[21:47] and bring them into your kingdom because
[21:49] we still believe the plan of redemption
[21:51] is going on lord until you get to the
[21:55] day that you take that even when you
[21:56] take the gentiles away
[21:58] there's still going to be a plan of
[21:59] redemption for the jews and then the
[22:00] plan of redemption for the earth
[22:02] which we'll cover uh far from here but
[22:05] lord just
[22:06] keep us in the center lord where we can
[22:09] we can see what's going on and and and
[22:12] not be
[22:12] worried about what's going on in the
[22:14] world lord but when we come together
[22:16] lord let us talk about you
[22:17] and let us let us say things that are
[22:19] pleasing to you father let our
[22:21] conversation be about you lord
[22:24] just lead us and guide us by your holy
[22:25] spirit bless us lord take care of us
[22:28] be with brother chris as he travels here
[22:29] lord next week about friday
[22:31] and be with him in his travels there we
[22:33] pray that you just touch him now in
[22:34] jesus name
[22:35] amen and good to have brother chris
[22:37] reynolds
[22:39] back with us amen he he's lost a little
[22:42] hair since the last time we've seen him
[22:45] but he has a new job but it's closer to
[22:46] here it's right around the corner at
[22:48] kubota and he's living in cleveland so
[22:51] this is where you ought to be hebrews 9
[22:55] verse 11
[22:57] but christ being coming high priest of
[22:59] good things to come by a greater and
[23:00] perfect tabernacle
[23:02] not made with hands that is to say not
[23:05] of this building in other words paul's
[23:06] talking about what went on back in the
[23:08] old testament
[23:09] as far as the the bulls and the goats
[23:12] and the hanging of the badger skin and
[23:13] all these different things
[23:15] holy of holies he's saying it's not
[23:17] there now it's more perfect tabernacle
[23:19] it's like brother dale's name
[23:20] flesh now all right
[23:24] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[23:26] but by his own blood he entered it
[23:28] once into the holy place and here's my
[23:30] point
[23:31] having obtained eternal
[23:34] redemption for us now that comes from
[23:37] the bible
[23:39] can't be changed but he obtained
[23:41] remember
[23:42] you can be seated the prophet of god
[23:44] told us he said
[23:45] jesus didn't come to bring in your
[23:49] inheritance
[23:53] that's kind of strange because we all
[23:54] thought no that's why jesus
[23:56] uh he came to what he said i
[24:00] am the way the truth and the life i am
[24:03] the way back to your inheritance brother
[24:05] i'm saying your inheritance was before
[24:07] the foundation of the world
[24:09] so i want us to see that that god has
[24:12] when this plan developed i can i want
[24:15] you to do something for me
[24:17] even today i want you to go home and
[24:20] just for a few minutes sit down and say
[24:22] i am god
[24:26] and just sit down and just let the plan
[24:29] of redemption unfold in your head now it
[24:31] doesn't have to be that's what i'm
[24:32] trying to break it down really
[24:34] intricate and get the little the little
[24:36] uh minute details
[24:37] but just be god and know that like
[24:40] brother dale said he
[24:41] he couldn't be the fullness of the
[24:42] godhead bodily at 12 years old yet
[24:45] inside of that man potentially was that
[24:47] part of him
[24:49] he didn't change persons
[24:53] you didn't change persons brother brown
[24:55] said when you got the new birth it was
[24:56] you and god
[24:57] together as persons amen
[25:01] so here we are we see a man standing and
[25:04] he was a man
[25:05] before the foundation of the world and
[25:07] he was as you would say
[25:09] like brother branham would say taking
[25:10] the picture but i would like to see a
[25:13] a man standing here a young boy and he's
[25:15] standing here in front of a desk
[25:18] floating out in eternity no no star
[25:22] no earth to put his feet on he's just
[25:24] right out there in eternity and he's
[25:26] just
[25:27] he's standing on something what he's
[25:28] standing on his revelation
[25:30] he's standing on his eternal foundation
[25:34] and brother chris he goes okay
[25:37] this is the way it's going to be we're
[25:40] going to put that over there
[25:41] we're going to put that because this
[25:42] whole thing that you see right here this
[25:44] was already in the mind of god
[25:45] before there was anything right before
[25:49] there was anything brother brown tells
[25:50] us
[25:51] how many people have you heard in any i
[25:54] say denomination in any
[25:56] form go on youtube go on different ones
[25:59] they never say
[26:00] let's go back into the back part of
[26:02] god's mind
[26:03] let's go back into eternity nobody ever
[26:06] does that
[26:07] they deal with what's right here they
[26:11] can't
[26:12] without the new birth you can't be in
[26:14] the mind of god
[26:15] you can't know what god knows but if you
[26:18] do have the new birth folks that's what
[26:20] i'm telling you you can go home today
[26:22] and say well now
[26:22] brother wait i don't understand it like
[26:24] you do you can understand it like you do
[26:26] right you got the same new birth i do
[26:28] you got the same holy ghost that wrote
[26:30] the bible
[26:31] you're just not letting him work that's
[26:33] our problem
[26:36] brother brown said the holy ghost is a
[26:38] gentleman
[26:40] glory if you don't want him to go
[26:43] through that door
[26:44] he's not going to bust that board that
[26:46] door down and go into whatever door in
[26:48] your heart or door
[26:50] something you harbor and it doesn't have
[26:52] to be sin it just has to be maybe
[26:54] i don't like to do this or i don't like
[26:55] to do that or something back and forth
[26:59] but let god in your house first you get
[27:02] god in your house
[27:03] right get god in your house and you have
[27:06] obtained an eternal he obtained eternal
[27:08] redemption
[27:09] what he got it from what before that he
[27:11] got it from the father
[27:13] amen
[27:16] amen but he was the father made manifest
[27:20] that's the son amen same person
[27:24] because listen we'll go to this first
[27:26] quote but listen that having obtained
[27:28] eternal redemption for us
[27:30] he didn't remember again it was a
[27:32] shocker when i read this quote
[27:35] jesus christ never came to bring you
[27:38] your inheritance
[27:39] that's right
[27:43] that even proves it right there having
[27:44] obtained eternal
[27:46] redemption for us his body
[27:49] he had to obtain redemption of his body
[27:54] amen amen it wasn't eternal it wasn't
[27:57] eternal until the death burial
[27:58] resurrection
[28:00] but he's the only one who could do that
[28:03] right
[28:05] because remember we'll get into it when
[28:09] we get into time because we're not going
[28:10] to be in time this is all
[28:11] the time and the seven dimensions and
[28:14] all that we'll get into that a little
[28:15] bit later
[28:16] but this is before as brother brown says
[28:18] before the eternal
[28:20] but now remember remember an eternal
[28:23] covenant or an eternal redemption never
[28:25] had a beginning
[28:27] and it'll never have an end right
[28:29] thereby got eternal
[28:31] but now there's many times that god has
[28:33] made
[28:34] an everlasting or a conditional covenant
[28:39] first thing in the garden don't eat of
[28:42] that
[28:42] do eat of that you'll live you'll die
[28:47] all right that's not unconditional
[28:49] though that's if adam didn't do that
[28:52] but now remember that's why i love the
[28:54] scripture we'll read it a little bit of
[28:55] genesis 3 15
[28:57] he said i will put enmity
[29:00] i will many times we're going to read to
[29:03] when abraham during his journey we're
[29:05] going to read in genesis 12
[29:06] where god says i will i will i will
[29:10] i will it's not abraham if you will he
[29:13] didn't ever say now abraham if you'll
[29:15] believe what i said
[29:16] no no he never said that
[29:20] it was many though everlasting covenants
[29:22] because god made an everlasting covenant
[29:24] with a rainbow
[29:28] but that's everlasting it's not eternal
[29:33] he'll make he made an everlasting
[29:34] covenant with different people down
[29:37] through time but that
[29:38] that everlasting covenant is done away
[29:40] with
[29:42] but an eternal covenant you can never do
[29:44] away with when god
[29:45] says i will so god in the beginning as
[29:49] the man i said is standing in his
[29:51] at his board here and he's already a
[29:54] creator because he had to create the
[29:55] board
[29:59] brother chris you got what i said nobody
[30:00] else did but anyway um
[30:03] so you look at god he's sitting here and
[30:04] he's going and
[30:06] listen i like what brother dale said and
[30:08] i hope he gets on the
[30:09] the um predestination because that's
[30:11] what i'm gonna cover a little bit
[30:12] but see god didn't just say
[30:16] this is it
[30:19] come on right
[30:22] because it's depending on your choice i
[30:25] thought
[30:26] so what you chose god knew if you had
[30:29] let's just say
[30:30] you had five choices in your life just
[30:33] say
[30:34] if brother louise had five choices in
[30:35] his life god knew all five
[30:38] how they would begin what would happen
[30:41] in his life
[30:42] who he he would not marry and marry and
[30:44] not have kids and have kids
[30:45] and if he did every one of them god
[30:47] would know why that you say oh brother
[30:49] wait no he's
[30:50] infinite an infinite god knows
[30:54] but by foreknowledge by what we're
[30:56] talking about right now this is for
[30:58] f-o-r-e for knowledge
[31:01] god could stand at his big booth here
[31:05] have you ever thought about this and
[31:06] every person that breathed
[31:09] a breath of life he knew
[31:12] when they would come what their choice
[31:15] would be
[31:16] and what would their choice be if they
[31:18] chose something else
[31:21] standing right here every person
[31:25] there's 7 billion people in the world
[31:26] now there's probably about 20 or so
[31:28] billion people in the ground
[31:30] that come from back from the flood back
[31:32] to here
[31:35] and he knew every one of them and what
[31:37] they would do
[31:38] and every choice that could be made
[31:40] every variable brother
[31:42] brother joe and i he didn't know i was
[31:43] going to preach on this but he got back
[31:45] there talking about chess
[31:47] he said in the first four moves of chess
[31:49] after the first four moves of chess
[31:50] there's not billions
[31:53] so many billions of different moves that
[31:56] you can make
[31:57] and that's just playing in a little
[31:58] board about this big
[32:01] much less an infant god you understand
[32:03] what i mean whatever move you made he
[32:05] knew that and if you didn't make that
[32:06] move
[32:07] he knew what was going to happen but to
[32:10] be god that's the way it had to be but
[32:12] listen
[32:13] you and i can't sit here though and
[32:15] fathom that in our brain it would drive
[32:17] us crazy
[32:18] right so he condescended
[32:23] yeah so that he could say let there be
[32:26] now we can understand that
[32:28] so we can say i'm going to create a ball
[32:31] call the earth i'm going to put it just
[32:33] far enough from the sun
[32:34] and i'm going to put my people on it
[32:38] let us make man in our image right
[32:41] so we take this god we can't understand
[32:43] down to a god now that we can understand
[32:46] but he doesn't change he didn't leave he
[32:49] didn't leave the father
[32:52] because the son did to create him but
[32:53] who did the speaking the word did the
[32:55] speaking
[32:57] but it wasn't it's like we were talking
[32:58] about last night but you got to remember
[32:59] one thing
[33:01] when you take jesus in the father when
[33:04] he says
[33:06] i only do that now you and i we have
[33:09] arguments in our brain every day
[33:13] with our self and you know what
[33:15] sometimes that might be god
[33:18] that you're arguing with hello
[33:23] but jesus never had a day when he got up
[33:26] and eat breakfast in the morning that he
[33:27] said something and the one inside of him
[33:30] said
[33:31] that's not right because he but remember
[33:34] he was the fullness
[33:36] he came without a carnal mind he came
[33:38] without a sex
[33:39] veil over his face
[33:42] amen our problem is is we got a past
[33:47] and it's kind of sorted because we don't
[33:49] know what but jesus knew his past
[33:52] that's right it was back there with the
[33:54] father he in john 17 he said oh pray
[33:56] father we'll get into it i'm way
[33:58] i'm moving on down this way through the
[34:00] message
[34:01] he said i want to have glory with you
[34:03] like we had before the foundation of the
[34:05] world
[34:07] it wasn't two people right but his plan
[34:10] of redemption was unfolding because he
[34:12] had to stand at his desk one day and say
[34:14] i gotta go save those people because
[34:16] this is the choices they made right
[34:20] and i go i'm going to have a group of
[34:23] people
[34:25] i'm going to have children there's
[34:27] lucifer
[34:29] you're not even in the picture buddy he
[34:32] helped fulfill this
[34:35] but remember if lucifer hadn't come
[34:39] there would have been none of this there
[34:42] would have just been god
[34:44] right up here at the top the seventh
[34:46] dimension and it would have been all of
[34:47] his bride
[34:48] spoken into existence and we'd lived in
[34:49] need and that would have been it
[34:51] i wouldn't say that was boring but there
[34:53] would be no plan
[34:55] there would be no your choice there
[34:57] would be no judge
[34:58] there would be no uh there would be no
[35:01] savior
[35:03] i'm going to read that quote to give him
[35:06] purpose
[35:07] to give god the ultimate purpose of all
[35:11] these different titles he had to put
[35:13] man in human flesh but before he did now
[35:17] here we go
[35:18] now here's number one before he put us
[35:20] in human flesh
[35:21] remember he's already know he already
[35:23] it's already
[35:24] he's already in the future home knows
[35:27] what's going to happen
[35:28] knows who's coming on the scene know
[35:30] who's going to do what
[35:31] no hitler was coming when he did this
[35:33] one was coming you
[35:35] you moses and you pharaoh and you
[35:36] everybody was coming in these places
[35:39] and he just wrote it out in the plan of
[35:40] redemption in the bible
[35:43] before the foundation of the world right
[35:46] and we're going to cover that because
[35:48] keep that in your mind keep the book in
[35:50] your mind
[35:51] amen now not a physical book
[35:54] everybody got that say amen not a
[35:57] physical book
[36:00] what's this old saying is i can read you
[36:02] like a
[36:04] a what i can read you like a book
[36:09] then that must be who you are you are
[36:12] the book
[36:14] that book of redemption that was open
[36:16] it's not a physical book
[36:18] that was me and you
[36:22] he opened the seals and revealed
[36:26] you the full plan of redemption so let's
[36:30] just read this number one right if i
[36:31] don't get through this
[36:32] i'm going to stop at 3 30
[36:37] and we'll continue on wednesday since
[36:40] this ain't gonna nobody preach on
[36:41] wednesday night i guess i'll do it
[36:44] that's a good song that's good did a
[36:46] good job
[36:48] job the oldest book in the bible was
[36:50] supposed to even be written before moses
[36:52] wrote genesis
[36:53] but the oldest book in the bible was
[36:54] speaking of redemption and yet
[36:56] redemption was
[36:57] far way before that hold on a minute
[37:00] look
[37:01] redemption was way before job wrote it
[37:04] in a book
[37:08] redemption is one of the oldest things
[37:10] in the bible
[37:12] did you know redemption was even before
[37:14] the plan of redemption was laid out
[37:16] before the world was ever formed
[37:20] think of that god foreseeing now there
[37:22] we go for
[37:24] knowledge he foreknew
[37:27] all things glory
[37:30] and what did it matter if it took him
[37:32] billions of years to see it all unfold
[37:34] he's eternal it doesn't really matter
[37:37] he probably saw it in an instant
[37:40] god foreseeing we might get into that a
[37:44] little bit with dimensions do you know
[37:46] when they talk about dimensions they all
[37:48] if you travel
[37:50] fast enough even in a a spaceship
[37:53] that when you come back you're not as
[37:56] old as you were when you left
[37:59] because your body is either speeding up
[38:01] or slowing down we'll talk about that a
[38:02] little bit later but it's already proven
[38:04] and that's what they're trying to do
[38:05] with with the uh moving people around
[38:07] you know taking them from one position
[38:09] put them in another like they did on
[38:11] star
[38:12] star trek oh star trek
[38:15] yeah i didn't you watched it didn't you
[38:20] you watched that on hulu didn't you
[38:22] think of that
[38:26] well you know i really think about
[38:28] though man has tapped into god's library
[38:29] that's what we've been talking about
[38:32] they know that there is a way to
[38:34] transport
[38:35] ask phillip asked phillip
[38:39] phillip was right here for one minute
[38:41] with a eunuch and all of a sudden
[38:42] he's over here in a revival and he
[38:45] didn't even say beat me up scotty
[38:49] y'all know what i'm going by now don't
[38:51] you but they would show them in that
[38:53] transporter room and what all of a
[38:54] sudden they'd get real fuzzy what
[38:55] breaking the atoms apart and send them
[38:57] in another
[38:58] and that's what they're doing but you
[39:00] know what that's what god did when he
[39:01] came back
[39:03] when he came back and walked through the
[39:04] wall and appeared to the disciples
[39:06] same thing happened he just broke his he
[39:09] just broke his atoms up walked right
[39:11] through the wall and put him right back
[39:12] together
[39:13] that's why you and i will travel like i
[39:14] thought because we'll have a same body
[39:17] like he had and he was walking on this
[39:19] earth and it was just still old felt the
[39:20] earth
[39:21] planet of redemption was not finished
[39:23] yet physically
[39:25] now when i say physically we know the
[39:27] plan of redemption i'm telling you was
[39:29] finished way before the foundation of
[39:30] the world the lamb was slain we'll read
[39:32] that in a minute before the foundation
[39:33] world but it had to physically happen on
[39:35] the earth
[39:36] right so god foreseeing and making a way
[39:39] of redemption before he even made the
[39:42] world
[39:43] for the bible plainly says that christ
[39:45] was predestinated
[39:46] for ordained and was the lamb of god
[39:48] slain before the foundation of the world
[39:50] that's right
[39:51] way before the world was made god had a
[39:54] plan of redemption
[39:56] that's why adam could do what he did and
[39:58] not get by with it but not be destroyed
[40:01] by it
[40:02] got it first corinthians two verse six
[40:07] well when i started doing this i really
[40:09] enjoy this so if y'all don't enjoy this
[40:11] i'm going to enjoy it right here
[40:14] i'm going to get in my little eternal
[40:15] bubble and i'm going to enjoy it right
[40:17] here
[40:18] i told brother kern and emma that we're
[40:20] we're just in this
[40:22] we're in this bubble we're into the if
[40:24] you don't get in god's bubble you're out
[40:25] in the world
[40:28] there's a protection that you can walk
[40:31] into this redemptive plan
[40:33] this eternal plan of god and be part of
[40:35] it or you can stay out there in the
[40:36] world that's right
[40:38] howbeit we speak wisdom
[40:42] among them that are perfect
[40:45] yet not the wisdom of this world nor of
[40:48] the princes of this world that what
[40:50] come to naught do you know one day as
[40:53] brother dale was talking about
[40:56] we see how that the bible tells us that
[41:00] just fear the second death because one
[41:03] day the soul
[41:05] if bill gates or whoever never gets born
[41:08] again
[41:10] he's just going to go away the greatest
[41:14] men in the world we've seen all the
[41:15] great people
[41:16] the great great leaders great minds of
[41:19] this world
[41:20] one day they're just gonna vanish
[41:24] never to be remembered again yeah
[41:28] that'd be hell enough for me to know
[41:30] that one day i was just gonna go
[41:32] completely out of distance and they're
[41:33] just not gonna be me no more
[41:35] but boy thank god for a plan of
[41:38] redemption
[41:39] that you can get inside that plan of
[41:41] redemption and you can just what
[41:43] eternal redemption it doesn't end
[41:47] amen nor of the princes of this world
[41:50] that come to naught
[41:53] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[41:56] mystery
[41:57] even the hidden wisdom which god
[42:00] ordained
[42:02] look now before the world unto
[42:05] our glory
[42:09] not his our glory
[42:14] titus 1 verse 1. paul a servant of jesus
[42:18] christ
[42:19] and an apostle a paul servant of god an
[42:21] apostle of jesus christ
[42:22] according to the faith of god's elect
[42:25] and the acknowledging of the truth which
[42:26] is after godliness watch
[42:28] in hope of eternal life which god that
[42:31] cannot lie
[42:33] promised before the world began
[42:37] promised remember the bible said he
[42:40] could swear by no other so he swore by
[42:42] himself
[42:45] but how did this but how does this
[42:46] develop
[42:50] but hath in due times manifest is his
[42:53] word through preaching
[42:55] so in other words there's a plan of
[42:56] redemption out there but somebody's got
[42:58] to get it to you
[42:58] right some's got to accept it somebody's
[43:01] got to live it
[43:02] so through preaching which is committed
[43:04] unto me paul
[43:05] now be careful according to the
[43:08] commandment of god
[43:10] our savior
[43:13] and we've read this scripture many times
[43:15] go to ephesians 1.
[43:17] we've read this scripture many times but
[43:18] i've never read it like this before
[43:21] this is the plan of redemption
[43:24] in about 11 verses
[43:29] give me ephesians 1 and i can explain
[43:33] the plan of redemption
[43:35] from ephesians 1. paul an apostle of
[43:37] jesus christ by the will of god
[43:39] to the saints which are at ephesus so
[43:40] it's not to everybody it's to the saints
[43:42] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[43:44] grace be to you and peace from god our
[43:46] father and from the lord jesus christ
[43:48] blessed be the god and father of our
[43:49] lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[43:51] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[43:54] places
[43:56] according as he has chosen us
[43:59] in him before
[44:02] the foundation of the world
[44:07] but now wait a minute that's not the
[44:09] whole plan
[44:11] that we should be holy and without blame
[44:15] before him in love
[44:19] having predestinated us unto the
[44:22] adoption of
[44:23] children by jesus christ what to himself
[44:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[44:29] will i i've always said if
[44:31] if you were to see that young 20 year
[44:33] old god
[44:34] i hate it when the world pictures god as
[44:36] a 80 year old man they can't hardly walk
[44:40] this is god
[44:43] no god's a 20 year old kid
[44:47] but he's standing there and he's going
[44:56] stop right there don't you think god's
[44:59] got a sense of humor
[45:01] he made you didn't he he made you didn't
[45:03] he
[45:06] that's what somebody says god got a
[45:08] sense of humor look at the platypus
[45:10] you know what platypus he's got like
[45:11] four different identities of four
[45:13] different animals in one
[45:16] but no look i think look according look
[45:18] i'm joking but look according to the
[45:20] good pleasure
[45:22] of his will his pleasure
[45:26] wants to have me and you here in all of
[45:28] our inadequacies
[45:30] and everything when david is the apple
[45:32] of god's eye yet he had his best friend
[45:35] murdered
[45:36] because he had committed adultery
[45:39] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[45:43] now remember god doesn't need grace
[45:47] we need grace god is grace
[45:51] but we need grace so if this is all this
[45:53] and all this blessing is being heaped on
[45:55] me and you
[45:57] wherein he has made us
[46:00] accepted in jesus christ who is the
[46:02] perfect one
[46:04] and to whom we have what redemption
[46:07] through his blood the forgiveness of
[46:10] sins
[46:12] according to the riches of his grace
[46:15] now watch wherein he hath abounded
[46:19] that's heath on we have to bound it
[46:23] toward
[46:23] us in all wisdom and prudence oh man i
[46:27] paul listen if brother branham could go
[46:30] back in the back part of god's mind he
[46:32] couldn't write the bible again
[46:35] but he could tell us what the bible said
[46:37] but now paul i believe went back in the
[46:39] back part of god's mind and god said
[46:40] this is what i want you to write down
[46:44] sorry paul wrote 80
[46:47] of the new testament which is what the
[46:49] eternal word of god
[46:51] glory wearing he hath the bounded toward
[46:55] us in all wisdom and prudence look
[46:57] having made known unto us
[47:03] the mystery of his will
[47:08] and christ the mystery of god revealed
[47:12] you were the mystery that was to be
[47:13] revealed which is christ in you the hope
[47:15] of glory right
[47:16] amen according to his good pleasure
[47:19] there he is again which he has purpose
[47:21] in himself
[47:23] in other words like i said his eternal
[47:25] covenant i will
[47:27] it doesn't abraham you can give your
[47:29] wife away twice i don't care
[47:32] i know at the end you're going to have a
[47:34] child i know you're going to believe me
[47:38] i know you me all of us are going to go
[47:41] out in the world for 20 years and do
[47:42] what we want to do but i know
[47:45] that when i come to you and say hey
[47:46] buddy this is it
[47:48] that you're going to respond in the way
[47:50] that you that god saw you respond before
[47:53] the foundation of the world
[47:56] folks let me tell you something god
[47:58] wrote every word of this bible
[48:01] for the people that are reading it glory
[48:03] that's right
[48:04] he did not write it to the whole world
[48:07] because he had you and mine when he
[48:09] wrote it
[48:11] now the world can read it and to some
[48:13] people it's a good story
[48:16] but to us it's god speaking to me and
[48:19] you
[48:20] i like that song i think zach williams
[48:22] sings it
[48:24] before i was made
[48:27] you wrote down my name and we're going
[48:30] to read the scripture a minute it's
[48:31] going to prove that
[48:31] before you were even made before your
[48:33] mom and daddy even before your mom and
[48:34] dad's mom and dad and mom and dad mom
[48:35] and dad was ever born god knew who you
[48:37] were
[48:38] and wrote you in a book right
[48:42] this whole bible is developed because of
[48:45] what
[48:45] christian people chose right i just
[48:48] believe that
[48:49] i just believe that have he made known
[48:53] unto who
[48:54] us not the world
[48:57] the mystery of his will according to his
[48:59] good pleasure when he has purpose in
[49:01] himself look
[49:02] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[49:05] of times
[49:06] that's right now in the 2000 years that
[49:10] it took for us to see there was a
[49:11] redeemer come on earth
[49:13] to this day here right here in the
[49:15] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[49:18] might gather together
[49:19] in one all things in christ
[49:23] both which are in heaven and which are
[49:25] on earth even in him now watch in whom
[49:27] also
[49:28] we have obtained an inheritance
[49:32] oh no i was born before the foundational
[49:34] world though i had to see it inside of
[49:36] me when i come
[49:36] forget it yeah right
[49:39] you got to obtain you got to fight for
[49:42] your redemption
[49:44] we know it's already set in god's mind
[49:46] no doubt
[49:48] but you and i don't even know what the
[49:49] next 10 minutes is going to
[49:51] bring he does
[49:54] and we don't go through it like this
[49:56] either
[49:58] nope you're a free moral agent until the
[50:00] day you
[50:01] pass away or we take a body change amen
[50:05] in him also we have obtained an
[50:07] inheritance
[50:08] now who do we obtain it from not jesus
[50:11] christ remember he didn't come to bring
[50:12] you an inheritance
[50:13] but if we connect ourselves to the way
[50:16] the truth and the life there our
[50:19] inheritance was before the foundational
[50:20] world you and i got to realize it
[50:22] and when brother branham come i mean
[50:23] that's a great thing when he said
[50:25] if you have eternal life you always was
[50:27] eternal yeah no doubt
[50:29] right but you got to receive it
[50:33] right he'll go on and people will just
[50:36] go right over the statement
[50:37] the little thing that he says he says
[50:39] now abraham lincoln
[50:42] this man goes to abraham lincoln and he
[50:45] says my buddy didn't shoot that guy but
[50:47] they're going to kill him tomorrow
[50:49] abraham lincoln writes down pardoned
[50:51] abraham lincoln
[50:52] the buddy takes it and says hey buddy
[50:54] look this is
[50:56] he didn't accept it right right right
[51:00] a pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[51:02] received or accepted
[51:04] as a pardon
[51:07] that's the same way with me and you
[51:09] you've got to accept that
[51:11] now once you become and you become
[51:13] quickened as paul says
[51:15] by the word of god then you realize
[51:18] then you know by when you read this
[51:20] right here when you read
[51:22] you predestinated and somebody like
[51:24] brother wade walks up and talks about
[51:26] eternal redemption having obtained
[51:28] eternal redemption for us
[51:30] you know that before the foundation of
[51:32] the world it was god that did it but it
[51:33] was god that saw what you would do
[51:37] oh i wish people could see that even
[51:39] people in the message can't even see
[51:40] that
[51:42] they just think i always was
[51:45] i'm going to tell you people something
[51:47] that's a lie the devil just like a
[51:49] father son holy
[51:50] ghost baptism
[51:55] let that soak in for a minute because a
[51:57] lie is a lie
[51:59] and it becomes the worst lie when they
[52:00] bring in the message
[52:03] and tell people they always was it
[52:04] doesn't matter you believe brother brown
[52:06] was a prophet yeah sure i do brother
[52:07] well you're well you always was eternal
[52:11] what about all this obtaining people
[52:13] what about all this striving
[52:15] what about all this fighting jesus even
[52:17] said he said
[52:18] the kingdom of god is taken by force
[52:22] not a flowery bread a bed of ease what
[52:25] take all that overcoming out of the
[52:27] what makes my righteous thing the nation
[52:29] get up take all that overcoming out of
[52:31] revelations then if you just always got
[52:33] it
[52:35] what you got to overcome
[52:39] come on all right let's get off of that
[52:42] and also we have obtained an inheritance
[52:45] being predestinated according what to
[52:46] the purpose that purpose
[52:48] before the foundational world that
[52:50] purpose he purposed i am going to have
[52:52] children on the earth
[52:56] that are my children right
[52:59] and i'm going to make a way for them to
[53:01] get back to that amen
[53:07] but i got to put them in human flesh
[53:10] so they make a choice listen let me tell
[53:12] you something
[53:14] that genesis 1 26 man don't make the
[53:16] choice
[53:20] now it always was eternal right
[53:24] but remember it wasn't in you you had to
[53:26] remember we bypassed that
[53:29] to come by mom and daddy to come by
[53:31] carnal knowledge to come by
[53:32] the fall to let this catch up to us
[53:36] yes then when they come together
[53:40] oh then you can say i always was eternal
[53:44] oh lord fill me up i've been waiting
[53:46] you've been waiting for
[53:48] an eternity for me to get here
[53:52] boy talk about patience
[53:56] being predestinated according to the
[53:58] purpose of him who worketh
[54:00] all things because remember you say well
[54:04] no
[54:04] you just said that we had a will listen
[54:07] i'm telling you though when god says i'm
[54:09] going to have a group of people i'm
[54:11] going to have a bride
[54:14] then that means he's going to have a
[54:15] bride
[54:17] devil can't do anything about it you
[54:19] can't do anything about it except get in
[54:21] it
[54:21] accept it and get in it then god saw
[54:24] that you
[54:25] did accept it and he had a scripture for
[54:27] you and a scripture for you and the
[54:28] scripture for you
[54:29] that quickened listen all of us didn't
[54:32] come the same way
[54:34] some would have come by by here at the
[54:36] altar someone would have come by
[54:38] laying on of hands some would have come
[54:39] by like i did was sitting in a in a
[54:42] camper in
[54:42] in lake malone in texas i mean uh
[54:46] texas kentucky yeah
[54:49] amen but i was caught i was reading the
[54:53] word of god
[54:55] the bible says while the word was being
[54:58] preached
[54:59] the holy ghost fell on the people
[55:02] amen amen
[55:06] see that's where i accepted it i've
[55:07] heard it for years i've heard it since i
[55:08] was a little boy
[55:10] right but look what did it do it put me
[55:13] into his perfect will
[55:16] this is all permissive
[55:19] we were born permissive because you know
[55:20] what god when he said genesis 1 26
[55:23] he said this is my plan this is going to
[55:25] be my kids
[55:26] they're going to come to adam and eve
[55:30] right that's it but it didn't
[55:34] but he knew that amen we'll get to that
[55:37] in just a second let's go to revelations
[55:39] 13
[55:39] 8 and all that dwell
[55:43] upon the earth shall worship him who the
[55:46] beast
[55:47] whose names are not written in the book
[55:51] of
[55:51] life of the lamb slain from the
[55:54] foundation
[55:56] of the world that's right
[55:59] and it doesn't stop me when brother
[56:01] branham says
[56:03] if you weren't there you're never going
[56:05] to be there
[56:06] that's all right you know why because
[56:08] god saw you'd never want it
[56:10] that bothered me for years you all know
[56:11] that it bothered me years that
[56:13] that that god would let maybe somebody
[56:16] just go a certain point in life or let
[56:18] somebody like adolf hitler come into the
[56:19] world or let
[56:20] let them continue on if i was god if
[56:22] they started messing with my kids i'd be
[56:24] just like
[56:26] but god allowed him listen by his end
[56:29] just because of his infinite mercy that
[56:32] that that
[56:32] donny comes to christ he knew that adolf
[56:36] hitler if he let adolf hitler live
[56:38] 1 million 2 million 3 million years
[56:42] adolf hitler would never come to the
[56:45] knowledge that he needed jesus christ as
[56:47] a savior
[56:49] but i'll guarantee you though when adolf
[56:50] hitler walks up to the day of judgment
[56:53] christ is going to say i came to you in
[56:55] 1935 or 36 or 32
[56:58] and i came to you on this day and you
[57:00] turned me down that's what made you who
[57:02] you
[57:02] are because you accepted the demon and
[57:04] you didn't accept me
[57:06] amen but now remember see god foresaw
[57:09] that
[57:11] knew what was going to happen so he
[57:13] didn't have to give him eternal life
[57:15] because he knew he would never accept it
[57:17] see to me that makes everything plain
[57:20] that makes it that god's not a judge
[57:22] he's not a
[57:24] i had a preacher one time in the message
[57:26] said that god was a respecter of persons
[57:29] people well see he had to build his
[57:33] case that we always were eternal
[57:36] that was his case building i said
[57:39] brother
[57:40] your prophet about 85 times
[57:43] and i don't even need the prophet i got
[57:45] 16 scriptures in the bible
[57:47] that said god is not a respecter of
[57:50] persons
[57:52] if he what listen if god respected one
[57:55] person above me and you
[57:57] we could walk up to the day of judgment
[57:59] and say you treated him different than
[58:00] you did me you can't judge me for that
[58:03] but see we can't do that he's not a
[58:06] respecter of person he'll he would have
[58:08] saved adolf hitler he'd have saved cain
[58:10] we know that it was in the bible right
[58:13] he would have saved judas
[58:15] oh no yes he would have brother branham
[58:18] said
[58:19] judas's problem was he didn't make it to
[58:21] pentecost
[58:24] but see god knew that and that went into
[58:28] the plan of god
[58:30] that he was not and listen and i know
[58:33] listen see you got quotes from brother
[58:34] man said he was born the son of
[58:35] perdition
[58:36] no he was born judas he had a choice
[58:40] but god knew though before the
[58:41] foundation of the world what his choice
[58:43] would be
[58:44] so therefore he could call him the son
[58:45] of perdition same way with satan he said
[58:47] i created you perfect
[58:48] we read that yeah all right here we go
[58:52] number two christ the mystery of god
[58:53] reveal
[58:58] he has showed or revealed in every type
[59:01] that's in the bible now when we start
[59:03] through this
[59:04] we're going to start into the old we're
[59:05] going to start in the old testament
[59:09] all right because you have to old
[59:11] testament's just as part of the plan of
[59:12] redemption as the new testament is
[59:14] all right that's what gets me about
[59:16] these uh men and women you start talking
[59:19] about dress and hair and all this stuff
[59:20] oh that's just old testament well you
[59:22] got 10 commandments out there in your
[59:24] yard don't you
[59:25] where'd that come from i come from the
[59:27] old testament
[59:29] kick it out like you kicked the other
[59:31] stuff out right
[59:33] but not it's just as important
[59:36] it's just as important
[59:39] he has showed or revealed in every type
[59:41] that's in the bible
[59:43] therefore the entire bible thank god for
[59:46] a prophet
[59:47] is the revelation of god's mystery in
[59:49] christ now i'm going to give you a
[59:51] definition
[59:51] of the word christ because remember
[59:53] jesus the flesh doesn't come into
[59:55] existence except two thousand years ago
[59:57] everybody got that say amen those of you
[59:59] that are asleep you can just keep on
[1:00:01] sleeping
[1:00:02] okay
[1:00:06] but this whole mystery is not wrapped up
[1:00:08] in
[1:00:09] one you say well now be careful but
[1:00:12] listen christ was before the foundation
[1:00:14] of the world
[1:00:16] jesus the flesh was not that's our
[1:00:18] savior that's our lamb that's the one
[1:00:20] that had that what
[1:00:21] took my sin because christ can't sin
[1:00:26] christ is not a sinner that's why i said
[1:00:28] that genesis 1 26 man's not a sinner
[1:00:30] we became a sinner because we didn't
[1:00:32] accept it that way
[1:00:34] our adam and eve sold us out we'll get
[1:00:37] to that
[1:00:38] the entire bible look is an expression
[1:00:41] of what now
[1:00:44] one goal
[1:00:47] that god had right but it's it it
[1:00:50] encompasses
[1:00:51] all this we're going to talk about but
[1:00:52] it's one goal
[1:00:55] the entire bible is an expression of one
[1:00:57] goal that god had
[1:00:59] one purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:01:02] entire bible
[1:01:04] and all the acts of the believers in the
[1:01:07] bible
[1:01:08] has been in type now listen
[1:01:14] you and i are not a type
[1:01:22] oh yeah we we we could be a type of
[1:01:24] christ that's okay but listen
[1:01:26] everything in the bible types the bride
[1:01:28] right right
[1:01:29] everything that's why he said look every
[1:01:32] type that's in the bible
[1:01:33] type in what christ where's christ
[1:01:35] christ in you not christ up in heaven
[1:01:42] like brother brown says like and that
[1:01:45] really
[1:01:45] he's true a lot of denominations can't
[1:01:47] get jesus off the cross he died for me
[1:01:49] two thousand years ago and that's all
[1:01:50] they say
[1:01:53] and they accept that no they ain't all
[1:01:56] of it
[1:01:57] he had to come back and get inside me
[1:01:58] and you
[1:02:01] and all the acts of the believers in the
[1:02:03] bible has been in type and expressing
[1:02:05] what god's great goal
[1:02:06] is and now in this last day
[1:02:10] he has revealed it and shows it glory
[1:02:15] and god's help well you'll see it right
[1:02:18] here this morning
[1:02:20] wow how positive what the lord has had
[1:02:22] in his mind
[1:02:24] all along you know a man couldn't say
[1:02:28] that unless he knew what he was talking
[1:02:29] about
[1:02:32] remember the box car was sealed up and
[1:02:33] it was just presuming
[1:02:36] we're just presuming unless that thing's
[1:02:38] open but when the seal's open
[1:02:40] remember what he said he said if you're
[1:02:41] missing the seals come back to this
[1:02:43] message right here
[1:02:45] the great expression of the seals is
[1:02:47] christ in you the hope of glory that
[1:02:49] christ is not in heaven
[1:02:51] christ is not in denominations christ is
[1:02:53] not even in the bible
[1:02:59] that's written words yeah
[1:03:02] right christ is an anointing
[1:03:05] amen now when he anoints what's in the
[1:03:08] bible
[1:03:08] that's him but you can read hey they
[1:03:11] read the bible and make him a trinity
[1:03:13] that is not the christ
[1:03:17] amen no false doctrine can be christ
[1:03:21] he can allow things to happen we know
[1:03:23] that his permissive will he allowed it
[1:03:25] to happen
[1:03:26] but now right here in this
[1:03:29] last day he has revealed it and
[1:03:33] shows it what a great thing
[1:03:36] let's go to revelations 12. no
[1:03:39] i'm sorry i'm sorry you're you're right
[1:03:41] i'm wrong i missed the page somewhere
[1:03:43] what am i doing
[1:03:44] here what am i doing you got me all
[1:03:47] messed up
[1:03:48] thinking about you singing that song
[1:03:50] with that pretty girl up here
[1:03:52] greek lexicon told you i'd get it in
[1:03:55] luis
[1:03:56] all right so let's look this is the
[1:03:58] definition of christ now i want to
[1:04:00] show you something here we know that
[1:04:02] christ is the anointing
[1:04:04] but we know that christ is the one that
[1:04:07] created all things
[1:04:08] when they were talking to jesus they
[1:04:10] couldn't understand the flesh
[1:04:12] standing there but peter says darth to
[1:04:15] cross the son of the living god which
[1:04:16] was spoken of he said
[1:04:17] my father revealed that to you but then
[1:04:20] in the bible it says we know you created
[1:04:22] all things well now they weren't
[1:04:23] they they had a they had a mystery there
[1:04:26] that this flesh guy
[1:04:28] that they saw several of them saw him
[1:04:30] come from a baby
[1:04:32] all the way up
[1:04:35] they had a problem with that even the
[1:04:38] pharisees had uh wait a minute
[1:04:40] before abraham was you what
[1:04:44] before abraham was you were what he said
[1:04:47] before abraham was i am
[1:04:49] what was speaking that was the one
[1:04:51] inside
[1:04:53] doing the speaking amen because jesus
[1:04:56] was lying
[1:04:57] if he was talking about this guy you the
[1:04:59] flesh guy
[1:05:01] right but he was talking about he was
[1:05:03] talking from within
[1:05:04] glory like brother we were talking about
[1:05:06] the other night hattie wright said the
[1:05:07] right thing
[1:05:08] it did not come from her persona it came
[1:05:12] from what was inside of her
[1:05:15] the holy ghost spoke and said the
[1:05:17] salvation of my two children because
[1:05:19] no one can give salvation except jesus
[1:05:21] christ
[1:05:22] that christ that was speaking back to
[1:05:24] what brother brown said that's why i'm
[1:05:25] telling you
[1:05:26] when you get the same when you hit the
[1:05:28] same spot that she hit
[1:05:31] when you say that ain't nothing but the
[1:05:32] truth in your revelation not hers
[1:05:35] that's a good story you understand what
[1:05:37] i mean but it's got to be personally to
[1:05:39] you
[1:05:40] when you stand one day and say when you
[1:05:42] stand up one day in this service and you
[1:05:44] say brother dale that ain't nothing but
[1:05:45] the truth
[1:05:46] you'll see things happen because what it
[1:05:49] done was it moved two
[1:05:51] people that were not born again i don't
[1:05:54] care what they say happened to them in
[1:05:56] that
[1:05:56] afterwards them two kids
[1:06:00] got eternal life y'all believe that i
[1:06:04] believe that
[1:06:05] i don't care about what nobody else
[1:06:06] believes but she said the salvation of
[1:06:08] my two kids
[1:06:10] and she got what she asked for and
[1:06:12] that's the same way brother dale's
[1:06:14] you're gonna have to keep saying my
[1:06:15] body's gonna be changed my body's healed
[1:06:17] my body's going to be changed i'm going
[1:06:18] to be changed in the moment in twinkling
[1:06:20] i believe what that bible says i believe
[1:06:22] what that says i don't care if i keep
[1:06:23] getting stooped and i can't
[1:06:26] say my words without breathing heavy
[1:06:30] you didn't have to laugh that loud i'm
[1:06:33] in better shape than i have been before
[1:06:36] but look i don't see how these preachers
[1:06:38] can run around all over the building
[1:06:40] for an hour and a half
[1:06:43] but this is the christ this was what was
[1:06:46] standing this was the guy that was
[1:06:47] standing in eternity
[1:06:49] the anointing the anointed person but
[1:06:52] what look
[1:06:53] consecrating jesus to the messiah office
[1:06:55] and furnishing him
[1:06:57] with the necessary powers for its
[1:07:00] administration right what brother braham
[1:07:03] say when you get the holy ghost he said
[1:07:05] god
[1:07:05] equips you for your journey that's what
[1:07:08] the christ is it equips you for your
[1:07:10] journey
[1:07:12] that's why i'm telling you we don't know
[1:07:13] what's going to happen this year but if
[1:07:14] you'll let that man talk to you inside
[1:07:16] he'll tell you what's going to happen
[1:07:17] this year and he will give you
[1:07:18] supernatural instruction on what to do
[1:07:22] but look i like this part enduring
[1:07:26] christians with the gifts of the holy
[1:07:28] spirit
[1:07:30] christ in you the hope of glory glory
[1:07:34] now look i want to show you something
[1:07:35] too though remember look by the
[1:07:37] revelation we see
[1:07:39] that christ was the one that was spoke
[1:07:41] through moses we're going to look at
[1:07:42] just a second a few of these examples
[1:07:44] christ spoke to abraham christ spoke
[1:07:46] through isaac he spoke to jacob
[1:07:51] but it was furnishing them for their
[1:07:53] journey
[1:07:55] so what is it doing for you it's
[1:07:56] furnishing you for your journey but
[1:07:58] moses journey was not my journey
[1:08:00] right i am not commissioned today
[1:08:04] to lead two million jews
[1:08:07] to a promised land but he was
[1:08:10] so that was christ brother brown said
[1:08:12] christ in moses
[1:08:15] right now not when he killed an egyptian
[1:08:17] not when he done the things wrong he did
[1:08:19] not when david went and had his best
[1:08:21] friend killed
[1:08:22] but when david stood up that day and he
[1:08:24] said
[1:08:26] i'll not leave my soul in hell or see my
[1:08:30] holy ones
[1:08:31] brother said a backslidden prophet jesus
[1:08:33] raised on a backslidden prophet's
[1:08:35] message
[1:08:36] but it was god that spoke that message
[1:08:39] that's the difference you got to
[1:08:40] remember you got to remember
[1:08:42] is it christ speaking or is it you
[1:08:44] speaking
[1:08:47] so let's look at a few examples in doing
[1:08:49] christians with the gifts of the holy
[1:08:51] ghost
[1:08:52] but now look let's go back to this this
[1:08:55] right here
[1:08:56] we know in the river jordan we know he
[1:08:58] got an anointing but that was anointing
[1:09:00] that was an anointing to create
[1:09:02] that was not an anointing to create
[1:09:04] things that was before the foundation of
[1:09:06] the world that anointing before the
[1:09:08] foundation of the world that christ
[1:09:10] he was anointed to create glory
[1:09:15] but now that anointing though had to
[1:09:16] come into human flesh
[1:09:20] so that the flesh could die for you
[1:09:22] that's right
[1:09:23] christ can't die christ can't sin
[1:09:27] christ is that genesis 1 26 man that's
[1:09:30] right
[1:09:32] but he gives you furnishes you with the
[1:09:34] necessary powers
[1:09:36] for what the administration it needs for
[1:09:38] the time adam
[1:09:40] let's go let's look at adam now here's
[1:09:42] adam
[1:09:44] adam's not a creator but adam takes
[1:09:46] creation and moves it around
[1:09:49] he has power over creation
[1:09:52] right brother brown said just as christ
[1:09:56] broods over the earth is what led the
[1:09:58] animals well that was through a
[1:10:00] through adam that was through adam
[1:10:03] because
[1:10:03] adam was was the ruler of the world
[1:10:05] right right
[1:10:07] so he was endued with that christ but
[1:10:10] now not when he did there at the end
[1:10:12] and that's what we were talking about
[1:10:13] last night adam couldn't be
[1:10:16] anything but the first adam he couldn't
[1:10:19] be the second adam because the second
[1:10:21] adam
[1:10:21] is one that could die for us
[1:10:25] and come back into us but the first adam
[1:10:29] he thought he maybe could save eve
[1:10:31] that's why i can't stand the doctrine
[1:10:33] they have of
[1:10:34] adam having to place a natural seed into
[1:10:36] eve to save her
[1:10:38] sex don't save nobody texas what's
[1:10:40] killing us all right now
[1:10:43] you understand what i mean
[1:10:46] but adam couldn't be a savior that was
[1:10:49] not in him
[1:10:51] it was in him to be a ruler it was in
[1:10:53] him to be what
[1:10:54] to be christ on the earth at that time
[1:10:56] to rule the animals and the wind
[1:10:59] and the storms and all whatever right
[1:11:02] but when adam walked out with eve
[1:11:06] brother brown said though that was
[1:11:09] christ
[1:11:11] he said because christ took on our sin
[1:11:14] as adam took on eve sin
[1:11:16] and walked out of the garden with her
[1:11:19] now see i can take that i'm not gonna
[1:11:22] take that he had
[1:11:23] sexual relationship with her to savor no
[1:11:26] adam seed natural seed is what's killing
[1:11:27] all of us now
[1:11:29] but being that that anointing was on
[1:11:32] adam
[1:11:35] right he wasn't the fullness of the
[1:11:37] godhead bible
[1:11:39] he was part of it maybe but when jesus
[1:11:42] walked on earth he was the fullness of
[1:11:43] the godhead body
[1:11:45] he wasn't he didn't just have the holy
[1:11:47] ghost he was the holy ghost
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:50] and being the holy ghost he could come
[1:11:53] back into me and you
[1:11:54] because he said out of his own mouth he
[1:11:57] said i'm going to send back the
[1:11:58] comforter
[1:12:00] which is the holy ghost and i'll not
[1:12:02] just live with you
[1:12:03] i'm going to be in you adam couldn't do
[1:12:06] that
[1:12:07] though adam be the god of the earth
[1:12:09] though adam named every animal though
[1:12:11] adam
[1:12:11] moved to trees adam could not say
[1:12:16] eve if you die i can come back and save
[1:12:19] you
[1:12:20] no because 900 years later adam died
[1:12:24] and he went somewhere he didn't come
[1:12:26] back into this world
[1:12:28] but jesus christ died 2000 years ago
[1:12:30] folks
[1:12:32] and he came back three days later and he
[1:12:35] ain't left the sins
[1:12:37] he's the only one who can do that
[1:12:40] abraham same way abraham we'll just go
[1:12:43] through these real quick then we'll
[1:12:44] close
[1:12:45] moses brother brown said what even the
[1:12:48] bible says
[1:12:49] that the people had to veil moses's face
[1:12:53] he was so close to god
[1:12:59] you know all right you're god
[1:13:03] because you're a lot older
[1:13:08] see what the world says you just old man
[1:13:10] but you're god though
[1:13:12] but look at but look at me and you
[1:13:13] though at the uh the situation if we
[1:13:15] would have been in that situation
[1:13:16] you know listen without the holy ghost
[1:13:18] in our soul all right
[1:13:21] got it because moses didn't have the
[1:13:23] holy ghost and his soul he was anointed
[1:13:26] but that anointed man though spoke to
[1:13:29] god one day and said god if you kill
[1:13:32] them people right there you're gonna
[1:13:33] have to kill me
[1:13:36] and you know what god said god didn't
[1:13:38] say okay bye
[1:13:42] he said okay moses i'll not kill them
[1:13:46] brother brown said he threw himself
[1:13:48] in the gap just as christ threw himself
[1:13:51] now see that's moses a man
[1:13:54] but he was anointed and equipped and
[1:13:56] furnished for the job he had
[1:13:58] right and part of the job was was try to
[1:14:01] save them
[1:14:02] ignorant people
[1:14:05] and god said okay moses okay abraham
[1:14:09] i know your wife just lied to me to her
[1:14:12] face
[1:14:17] i know your wife just lied to me
[1:14:20] straight to my face
[1:14:22] but i can't kill her because that'd have
[1:14:25] to kill you
[1:14:28] showing that god will not ever kill his
[1:14:31] bride
[1:14:33] god has never killed his bride you say
[1:14:36] oh no
[1:14:37] no we don't have the second death
[1:14:38] remember
[1:14:40] we may die one time but we'll never be
[1:14:43] part of the second death
[1:14:46] because we already died here we died in
[1:14:48] christ
[1:14:50] amen that moses veil his face
[1:14:54] so close to god to when he spoke god
[1:14:57] backed it up
[1:15:00] and joshua
[1:15:04] son you need to hang on just a little
[1:15:07] while
[1:15:08] i got a battle i need to fight
[1:15:12] physical joshua couldn't do that
[1:15:16] it had to be christ because christ had
[1:15:19] to speak through joshua he was in an
[1:15:21] urgent
[1:15:21] position the prophet said he needed he
[1:15:24] knew that if that sun went down the
[1:15:26] the people he was fighting would get
[1:15:28] back together
[1:15:31] it was an urgent cry from a believer
[1:15:37] it didn't have the new birth in the soul
[1:15:40] but he had an anointing for his time
[1:15:43] amen
[1:15:44] for his administration and you know what
[1:15:46] god did
[1:15:47] god said
[1:15:50] i'll do that sun stand still right here
[1:15:56] moon don't you move in your place who
[1:15:58] could have done that joshua didn't do
[1:16:00] that
[1:16:01] christ through joshua did it same way
[1:16:03] with me and you listen you get in an
[1:16:05] urgent position
[1:16:10] you stand and say god you stopped the
[1:16:13] son for a man in the old testament
[1:16:16] so he could finish his job you stopped
[1:16:18] the moon
[1:16:21] lord do something because i need you
[1:16:25] my kids need saving amen
[1:16:29] everything just keep this just stand
[1:16:31] there like joshua
[1:16:37] david wrote all those psalms about
[1:16:42] christ and the ethiopian eunuch he was
[1:16:45] so writing about christ till the
[1:16:46] ethiopian eunuch says this man speaking
[1:16:48] of himself or is he speaking of another
[1:16:50] that was christ speaking through david
[1:16:52] but when the anointing came off of david
[1:16:54] he didn't furnish david for the job of
[1:16:56] going finding somebody else's wife
[1:17:00] that was his humanity speaking
[1:17:04] but now remember this is where it gets
[1:17:06] unbelievable
[1:17:08] we'll close right here after we get to
[1:17:10] elijah and then we'll take up
[1:17:13] next sunday
[1:17:16] remember
[1:17:20] if david he had a bunch of wives
[1:17:24] right a bunch of them bunch of wives
[1:17:28] hundreds don't know how you got anything
[1:17:30] done
[1:17:35] but the promised son could only come
[1:17:38] through
[1:17:43] it bathsheba our mind that god would use
[1:17:47] an act like that but it was to show
[1:17:51] that he's going to have his plan it's
[1:17:54] going to be
[1:17:54] just like rahab why in the world would
[1:17:56] you bring rahab in
[1:17:58] any of this a woman that had had many
[1:18:02] many many men in a city she was a
[1:18:04] prostitute
[1:18:06] yet god brought that man david through
[1:18:08] that
[1:18:10] promised jesse oh bad
[1:18:14] all the way down obed jesse
[1:18:17] boaz the type of christ i left him out
[1:18:19] boaz
[1:18:20] all came through an israeli general
[1:18:23] doing what god told him not to do
[1:18:26] yeah he married a gentile prostitute he
[1:18:28] didn't just marry a gentile woman he
[1:18:29] married a gentile prostitute
[1:18:33] we can't figure god out but i can see
[1:18:34] the redemption part in that though
[1:18:37] i can see how god saved her you and i
[1:18:40] had many
[1:18:42] husbands drinking smoking gambling
[1:18:47] yeah we were married many many times and
[1:18:49] if god hadn't
[1:18:50] done away with them you and i couldn't
[1:18:52] have christ goes remember
[1:18:54] peter paul says i give to you
[1:18:57] a chaste virgin when you receive the new
[1:19:01] birth
[1:19:02] you change back to a virgin not you went
[1:19:04] not physically
[1:19:06] see that's where the catholic church
[1:19:07] gets so close with all that
[1:19:10] changing you back but you're you're a
[1:19:11] chaste virgin you have no other husband
[1:19:13] then
[1:19:13] all your husbands should be dead that
[1:19:16] was what was happening with rahab
[1:19:19] the bible says all of jericho was killed
[1:19:22] so every one of her accusers were dead
[1:19:25] that's what jesus said to the woman
[1:19:27] when she said throw her down and say
[1:19:28] woman where's your accuser she said i
[1:19:29] have none he said well i didn't see you
[1:19:30] do it either
[1:19:31] right that's right he hears our voice
[1:19:35] through the blood
[1:19:36] yes amen and there's elijah how in the
[1:19:39] world can a man
[1:19:40] stand up and say it'll not rain
[1:19:44] until i call for it right that wasn't
[1:19:46] elijah
[1:19:49] that was christ and elijah that was
[1:19:52] christ breaking the airwaves and said
[1:19:54] they'll not even
[1:19:55] do fall on the ground now listen we've
[1:19:57] been through some droughts right
[1:19:59] we've been through droughts not three
[1:20:00] and a half years of it but
[1:20:02] what about a drought that because here
[1:20:04] in georgia i mean you get a good dew on
[1:20:05] the ground and you can survive for a
[1:20:07] little while
[1:20:08] because it's really wet but he said not
[1:20:09] even dew will touch the ground for three
[1:20:12] and a half years that wasn't elijah
[1:20:16] so what are you saying brother wade me
[1:20:18] and you are gonna have to be
[1:20:21] like those people but we got the new
[1:20:23] birth our purpose in life is is that you
[1:20:25] know why he wants us to speak
[1:20:26] right he wants us to speak it
[1:20:31] he wants us all right
[1:20:34] musicians get ready to come we'll read
[1:20:35] this one quote and we're going to stop
[1:20:37] right here i told you to be 3 30. all
[1:20:38] right
[1:20:40] let's read number three and then we'll
[1:20:45] now god seek great secret mystery he had
[1:20:48] before the world began
[1:20:49] now back in the back part of god's mind
[1:20:51] there was something that he was trying
[1:20:53] and going to achieve remember god is
[1:20:56] going to say i will and it will not come
[1:20:58] any other way
[1:21:01] and he had a motive in doing it
[1:21:07] remember brother brown talked about you
[1:21:08] he said whatever decision you make let
[1:21:10] it be the right
[1:21:11] motive and the right objective all right
[1:21:14] and he had a motive in doing it and what
[1:21:16] in order to let himself be healer
[1:21:19] savior redeemer
[1:21:24] he couldn't do it when there was nobody
[1:21:26] nobody was lost that's right
[1:21:28] in order to let him be expressed because
[1:21:30] first there wasn't even a moonstar at a
[1:21:32] molecule or anything
[1:21:33] he was god but he exactly wasn't god at
[1:21:36] that time because god is an object of
[1:21:38] worship
[1:21:38] there was nothing to worship him so in
[1:21:40] his great mind he wanted these
[1:21:42] attributes to be expressed and in him
[1:21:45] was love and him was to be father and
[1:21:47] him was to be son and him was to be
[1:21:49] savior and him was to be a healer
[1:21:51] and all these great attributes that we
[1:21:53] see already expressed see we're seeing
[1:21:55] them already expressed now
[1:21:59] they were in god so my opinion the first
[1:22:02] thing that he made was angels
[1:22:03] then they worshiped him and that made
[1:22:05] him god and he started from there
[1:22:07] now that's what we're going to start
[1:22:08] with wednesday as in previous messages
[1:22:11] i've tried to explain break it down
[1:22:13] and now then when angels began to
[1:22:15] worship him that was before there was
[1:22:16] even a molecule
[1:22:18] on the earth we covered this that was
[1:22:19] the first thing created with angels
[1:22:21] lucifer and the angels there was nothing
[1:22:24] it was all darkness there wasn't no sun
[1:22:26] no moon no star no nothing he was god as
[1:22:28] he asked job
[1:22:29] where were you when i laid the
[1:22:30] foundations of the world
[1:22:32] right
[1:22:36] the sons of god shouted to go for joy
[1:22:38] the morning starts saying to the other
[1:22:39] sons god shouted for joy see now
[1:22:41] where were you see that was way back
[1:22:43] before the earth now god had a purpose
[1:22:45] and a hidden mystery
[1:22:47] and that's what i want to speak on to
[1:22:49] the church this morning
[1:22:51] the hidden mystery of god that he had in
[1:22:54] his mind before the world ever began
[1:22:56] now watch and how it's unfolded itself
[1:23:00] right down to this present hour that
[1:23:03] we're
[1:23:04] living all right then you will
[1:23:06] understand clearly then you see
[1:23:08] on i believe what is being done that's
[1:23:11] why
[1:23:11] musicians come that's why we're covering
[1:23:13] this
[1:23:14] we're covering this so that we can all
[1:23:17] understand
[1:23:18] the perfect plan of redemption the
[1:23:20] eternal
[1:23:22] plan of redemption
[1:23:25] because folks you're not going to ever
[1:23:26] forget it
[1:23:28] you're going to know how you got there
[1:23:37] remember what brother branham said on
[1:23:38] that we were listening to just now he
[1:23:40] said oh
[1:23:40] he said you know old brother brown i
[1:23:41] made it when now you hear me sing an
[1:23:43] amazing grace
[1:23:44] how sweet the sound down on the curve of
[1:23:47] the river there somewhere you know he
[1:23:49] he made it pretty uh pretty clear where
[1:23:52] he was going to have his little cabin at
[1:23:54] let's stand to our feet god bless you
[1:23:58] but this eternal plan of redemption and
[1:24:00] you know what you say well brother wait
[1:24:01] it's eternal planner
[1:24:02] yeah it's an eternal plan redemption
[1:24:04] because you and i are going to continue
[1:24:06] to talk about it and continue to talk
[1:24:07] about it and continue to talk about it
[1:24:09] and continue to talk about it and
[1:24:10] continue to talk about it
[1:24:12] because it's not going to have an end
[1:24:14] we're going to get a piece of it here
[1:24:17] but if you don't get a piece of it here
[1:24:19] you want part of it back there and you
[1:24:21] sure ain't going to be a part of it that
[1:24:22] way
[1:24:26] think so

[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:04] you know the world is looking for christ
[1:28:05] to come back
[1:28:08] he's already here he's already here
[1:28:13] they're going to miss that part why
[1:28:15] because their traditions
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:18] has told them in the book they read
[1:28:21] that christ is coming back either on a
[1:28:23] cloud or on a horse or something
[1:28:25] eastern skies are going to split this is
[1:28:27] going to happen that's going to happen
[1:28:29] but we know one thing's for sure he's
[1:28:32] already here
[1:28:34] equipping us and getting us ready to
[1:28:36] take us there
[1:28:38] not that he's coming he's already here
[1:28:42] and that's what we look at the bible and
[1:28:44] we see
[1:28:45] that's why it says the original life the
[1:28:47] original seed the original word
[1:28:48] everything in it that what we're talking
[1:28:50] about is original
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:54] the son of man is revealed in a bride
[1:28:58] because this what it's christ in human
[1:29:01] flesh
[1:29:02] called the son of man that's what jesus
[1:29:04] was jesus christ the son of man
[1:29:07] and i like that too i want you to
[1:29:08] realize one thing i hope we do something
[1:29:10] for july the 4th this year i'm putting
[1:29:12] this out here real quick
[1:29:13] because july the 4th 1971
[1:29:18] on a sunday we had our first church
[1:29:21] service
[1:29:22] this year july the 4th
[1:29:26] 2021 falls on a sunday
[1:29:30] and it will be our 50th jubilee the
[1:29:33] golden jubilee
[1:29:35] the one that gets us out of here the
[1:29:38] golden jubilee
[1:29:40] july the 4th of this year on a sunday
[1:29:44] brother chris it just happens to be on a
[1:29:46] sunday it cycled 50 years and now it's
[1:29:48] back on sunday july the 4th
[1:29:51] 2021 who'd have thought it
[1:29:54] we thought the rapture was going to take
[1:29:55] place in july
[1:29:58] 1976 or january 1st
[1:30:01] right or 1977 but it didn't
[1:30:05] because we didn't understand what a
[1:30:07] prophet was telling us
[1:30:09] i believe since then we've unders we've
[1:30:12] understood a little more about what the
[1:30:13] prophet said
[1:30:15] i believe we are i believe we're though
[1:30:17] in the final countdown though
[1:30:19] i believe god has equipped us the
[1:30:21] finality
[1:30:22] he's equipped us to take this journey
[1:30:25] because listen folks
[1:30:27] we know this eternal redemption is
[1:30:29] eternal and we know that when we leave
[1:30:31] this redemption goes to israel and then
[1:30:33] it goes to the world and then it goes to
[1:30:35] a white throne judgment
[1:30:36] there's still redemption going on but
[1:30:38] now listen for the gentile church
[1:30:41] folks we're at the door we're like right
[1:30:45] here
[1:30:46] we're not looking we're it's right here
[1:30:48] the end of the gentile
[1:30:50] bride age is just within minutes of
[1:30:53] being over
[1:30:54] as far as god's time is just and if it
[1:30:56] was three minutes till midnight back
[1:30:57] when brother adam was here
[1:31:00] it may be just seconds but remember what
[1:31:03] i told you
[1:31:04] god said i'll come and get you but
[1:31:07] remember
[1:31:08] he'll not always strive with man
[1:31:11] he's going to be gracious and he's going
[1:31:14] to have grace and he's going to have
[1:31:15] patience but one day though
[1:31:17] that door is going to close and remember
[1:31:21] mo i mean noah did not close the door of
[1:31:23] the ark
[1:31:25] god closed the door god said that's it
[1:31:29] no more that dispensation is over
[1:31:32] you didn't listen to my preacher for 120
[1:31:35] years
[1:31:38] this is your last day he said
[1:31:41] noah go get in the art within seven days
[1:31:43] he said i'm gonna make it rain
[1:31:45] he protected noah but he also protected
[1:31:49] enoch
[1:31:50] who went before that we don't go through
[1:31:54] tribulation
[1:31:55] right no no no noah's the top of the
[1:31:58] tribulation saints it's not
[1:31:59] he's not even type of us enoch is the
[1:32:02] top of us
[1:32:03] we take a rapture before the flood
[1:32:04] happens you love the lord
[1:32:07] that's what god showed us in the end
[1:32:08] time he showed us these things showed us
[1:32:10] what we were doing how it was going
[1:32:12] you could put it i mean you know i i
[1:32:14] can't make a very good chart but it's
[1:32:15] that's pretty much truth all the way
[1:32:17] across i say it's 100 truth
[1:32:19] but you and i are going to have without
[1:32:21] a profit of god though
[1:32:23] you take that you take that to anybody
[1:32:25] else and you let them see it and they're
[1:32:26] going to pick it apart
[1:32:28] because of their ideas and their
[1:32:30] denominational ideas
[1:32:32] and and most in the message because it
[1:32:34] look there's there's not
[1:32:36] it's just no seven years after the
[1:32:39] i mean uh three and a half years after
[1:32:41] the rapture takes place
[1:32:42] it's seven years according to the bible
[1:32:47] bible we're bible people amen
[1:32:50] so was brother branham he was a bible
[1:32:52] prophet can't make him say
[1:32:54] something that he didn't say let's bow
[1:32:55] our heads all mind's clear
[1:32:57] lord jesus we pray that you take care of
[1:32:59] the people on the way home
[1:33:01] we pray that we've said something lord
[1:33:02] that will spark an interest in their
[1:33:04] heart maybe they can go back and study
[1:33:05] you more lord
[1:33:07] that we know that we have been equipped
[1:33:10] lord jesus in the countdown the prophet
[1:33:12] of god told us he said this is the only
[1:33:13] age that we could have astronauts
[1:33:16] and so this is the only only age that we
[1:33:19] as the bride of jesus christ can be
[1:33:21] thinking and being equipped to make that
[1:33:24] journey out of this dimension into
[1:33:26] another one

[1:33:54] not much time of playing around you went
[1:33:57] around horeb for 40 years and finally
[1:33:59] you said this is
[1:34:00] it you either accept me or reject me
[1:34:03] father we know that that's a horrible
[1:34:05] thing but we know that
[1:34:07] there is a time lord that you're going
[1:34:09] to not
[1:34:11] have any more gentiles to be saved
[1:34:13] that's just your part of your plan lord
[1:34:16] and we pray that we'll if we're not part
[1:34:18] of that plan that we will become a part
[1:34:20] of that plan by the baptism of the holy
