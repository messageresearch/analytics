[0:02] all right let's go we're Olympians
[0:06] we work we're going to go through the
[0:08] book of Philippians here it's it's not a
[0:09] very long book but it's full of some
[0:12] really good nuggets and then we're going
[0:14] to start where we say revelation
[0:16] tremendous room we're gonna go
[0:18] revelations I think it was a revelation
[0:22] yeah okay go go go into the book of
[0:24] Revelation also so here we go Olympian
[0:29] student but in Revelation more than any
[0:32] change if they're there for being any
[0:35] consolation at welcome us go back
[0:36] remember this is a continuation of Paul
[0:40] writing a letter with Luke in 28 and in
[0:44] nothing terrified by your adversaries
[0:46] which is to them and evident token of
[0:49] perdition but to you of salvation in
[0:51] that of God so he's talking about the
[0:52] two divisions far into you it is given
[0:55] on the behalf of Christ not only to
[0:57] believe on him but also to suffer for
[1:00] his sake I'm telling you you know you
[1:02] we were talking me and dad will come at
[1:06] something the other day you're really
[1:08] you don't have to call persecution on
[1:11] anybody because it will automatically
[1:12] come there's always because when Jesus
[1:15] walked on the earth I think he was this
[1:17] meat mile person sure he's a king of
[1:18] peace but you got to realize when he
[1:20] walked on the earth he said I didn't
[1:22] come to bring peace right
[1:24] I come to bring a division a sword in
[1:28] other words you gotta fight to get into
[1:30] this kingdom
[1:31] you got peace inside but you're gonna
[1:32] have to fight because jesus knew the
[1:34] outside man was going to have to fight
[1:35] foreign to you as given on behalf of
[1:37] Christ not only to believe on him but
[1:39] also to suffer for his sake having the
[1:42] same conflict which you saw in me now
[1:44] Lane I thought my the conflict never
[1:47] worked Paul winning especially in his
[1:49] first convergent early conversion where
[1:51] were Paul when he was Paul the
[1:54] persecutor I mean poor lad a nice he had
[1:58] to have a real revelation to lay his
[2:00] hands on Paul because remember remember
[2:02] God told him in a vision see this
[2:04] coming to come into your house and you
[2:05] got lay hands on him in salute easy as
[2:07] he saw install so in my but anyway you
[2:14] see how the lecto brother Marcus wings
[2:17] denied after service us you know Germans
[2:19] earth are known to be staunch and real
[2:22] you know real arrogant and real hateful
[2:25] and I said but I finally met one
[2:28] oh god bless you man coming to them but
[2:32] I've met but to meet a German with the
[2:35] Holy Ghost is totally different look at
[2:37] his actions your German German no he's
[2:55] working on in yourself you can't do it
[2:58] that's why I'm telling you when you tell
[3:00] your testimony it's a testimony of what
[3:02] God's done it's not just what you do the
[3:05] real you wanted to do right the real
[3:08] human you wanted to do anyway with
[3:10] polity you see Paul having the same time
[3:12] claims which he saw in me and now here
[3:14] to be in me role Paul bless his heart
[3:16] that where he went he was either
[3:17] persecuted by the Christians at first
[3:19] I'm sure they were like hey Luna he's
[3:22] not the devil in God because remember
[3:24] brother Graham says believers can't find
[3:26] believers their holy ghost camp like the
[3:28] Holy Ghost so when the Holy Ghost in
[3:29] those Christian believers saw and felt
[3:32] the Holy Ghost in Paul then they had to
[3:36] come together whether Paul was he was a
[3:38] staunch Jew brother Ram City was the
[3:40] hook nose to you start you at first but
[3:43] he had Godhead remember pulse that I had
[3:45] forget all that gosh what he's writing
[3:48] to the Philippians look I I'm still
[3:50] having a conflict there but it's not
[3:52] actually with the Christians now it's
[3:55] with the people that were egos in the
[3:57] you know they stoned him they whipped
[3:59] him apply something they beat him they
[4:02] put him in prison what because he
[4:04] preaching the gospel not cuz he's
[4:06] persecuting the Christians the advantage
[4:07] to an IV when persecute the Christian it
[4:09] was the so-called Christian world
[4:11] to keep them it's always been that way
[4:14] Jesus had no problem with sinners none
[4:18] zero he had no problem with centers
[4:21] prostitutes and they even asked him said
[4:23] why does your master sit with these
[4:25] publicans and sinners and all these
[4:27] people and Jesus told and said look they
[4:31] need me in other words it's not that
[4:35] they didn't the Pharisees didn't even
[4:37] they didn't want me so they were there
[4:40] it's the separation there's the Bible
[4:41] that was between and you look in the
[4:44] Christian world or this you know
[4:45] Christian I don't say so-called
[4:47] Christian world Kalev trying their best
[4:48] I can do out there in the world but
[4:51] they're missing the mark they're missing
[4:54] it i watch the guys names john macarthur
[4:57] and he's a good preacher nominal
[4:59] preacher but i was looking on YouTube
[5:02] and it said should women preach or teach
[5:05] in the church and I thought I want to
[5:07] hear what they got to say about this but
[5:08] you know most people 67 percent of the
[5:11] people he read accepted women now as
[5:13] leaders in the church sixty something
[5:15] percent but nobody
[5:17] I never heard even a message believer
[5:20] lay it in the Bible like he laid it in
[5:22] about one he did an outstanding job but
[5:25] you got to remember though he heads back
[5:27] toward the Trinity he's got to follow
[5:29] son Holy Ghost baptism
[5:30] he's got the part that we have right
[5:33] he's got that wrong but not as far as
[5:35] women preaching and teaching in the
[5:37] church baby he lays it on the line he
[5:40] even lays it but where he goes back into
[5:42] civilization everywhere a woman comes
[5:44] into power the men get weaker because
[5:47] it's not the natural order of a kingdom
[5:50] of Genesis everywhere a woman comes into
[5:53] power he shows Cleopatra's surely for a
[5:56] while they were wonderful great you know
[5:58] people but then all of a sudden that
[6:00] fall was was horrible
[6:01] but yeah he brings it out I mean he did
[6:03] a good job teaching it but what I'm
[6:05] saying is he doesn't have all the pieces
[6:07] he's got the cow he's got the grass
[6:09] he's got the picture but the cows on the
[6:12] top of the tree and can't get to the
[6:14] grass so you picture from so but we
[6:18] don't we have it right that's what we're
[6:20] talk about today and starting them and
[6:22] coming about this revival that were that
[6:24] we're going to talk about it being a
[6:26] word revival
[6:27] you can't revive something in the that's
[6:29] wrong the devil can but you can't look
[6:34] in Christian the Christian world through
[6:36] Christian world God cannot revive
[6:38] anything that has error in it I'll read
[6:41] you the quotes from everything with
[6:42] brother Graham tells us that and it
[6:44] ought to be common sense how you're
[6:45] going to revise something that's wrong
[6:46] God can't revise something that's wrong
[6:48] but once you get you teaching right you
[6:51] get all the things right then God can
[6:52] what he can revive what's already
[6:55] revivals what's already inside of you
[6:57] being brought back down if there be any
[7:00] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[7:01] love if any fellowship of the Spirit if
[7:03] any bowels and mercies fulfill you might
[7:07] joy that ye be like-minded like him it's
[7:12] okay to be persecuted it's okay to be
[7:14] talked about having the same love being
[7:16] of one Accord of one mind let nothing be
[7:20] done through strife or vainglory but in
[7:23] lowliness of mind let each esteem other
[7:25] better than himself and that's where we
[7:29] get in trouble a lot of times I heard
[7:31] somebody the other day they talked about
[7:33] I I mean me I told them I said you know
[7:36] the slogan says there's no I in team
[7:38] this guy there's no team and I cuz he
[7:42] ain't got nothing but nobody but
[7:44] yourself out of this and all that so you
[7:46] have to be careful watch these people
[7:47] because that try your best to esteem
[7:51] others above yourself whether you
[7:54] whether they doesn't matter classes
[7:55] doesn't matter color doesn't matter
[7:56] where we came from there know that
[7:58] matter but it's what we're all one in
[8:01] Christ be a look not every man on his
[8:03] own things but every man also on the
[8:05] things of others you think well that's
[8:06] being a busybody that's been no he's not
[8:10] talking about things I phoned our
[8:13] watches and all let's know if there's a
[8:17] man like we've had two brothers come in
[8:19] here with
[8:20] brother Marcus preaching the way they
[8:22] preached and bringing the word like
[8:24] they're bringing it I don't want to know
[8:26] what they know I want more of what they
[8:28] got and then same way my brother Dale
[8:30] preaching today he comes in breaks a
[8:33] daily Mass so that's what Paul's saying
[8:34] he's he's not saying if you know you got
[8:38] a Cadillac I want to count around with
[8:39] your Cadillac and all the Bob that's
[8:41] coming you can't cover it look that's
[8:45] one of them ten suggestions I mean
[8:47] Commandments things we'll look at
[8:54] interest of others and that would be
[8:57] right you look on the interested what
[9:00] brother Marcus was preach and I had an
[9:01] interest in what he was saying I was
[9:02] interested in what he was saying same
[9:04] way we're brother Chris brother Dale
[9:05] whoever the preaching the true word all
[9:07] these brothers sent here okay but it's
[9:10] good to have fresh things you know it's
[9:12] good to have fresh fresh revelation
[9:14] fresh you we have to have fresh manna I
[9:18] stay another day when I went through the
[9:20] dam in seventy weeks down here and we
[9:22] get all that wheel chart and all that
[9:23] thing I couldn't remember none of that
[9:25] but it was fresh then but it's not fresh
[9:28] now but the way I brought it now was the
[9:29] way it should have been brought and then
[9:31] we're going to just leave it alone cuz
[9:33] it's all archived and you can read it
[9:34] somewhere and it's stuck down there
[9:35] somewhere not here here this is where
[9:40] you process the truth it goes through
[9:42] here but you process it with them in oh
[9:44] man all it says the inner man is where
[9:46] your strength comes from not Turkey you
[9:48] got to have your brain but it stops
[9:50] filtered down here look not every man on
[9:54] his own things so here we go it's not
[9:56] that we covet because the Bible tells us
[9:57] in the Ten Commandments not to cut it so
[9:59] we're not coveting and you know we're
[10:03] not supposed to steal but I like
[10:05] stealing other people sermon Haeju
[10:09] brother asked me that one time see no
[10:10] way you didn't steal people's sermons I
[10:12] said I still AM every Sunday never wins
[10:14] do that great I steal brother branham's
[10:16] out 1157 sermon by state law I taped but
[10:20] what do you just say the kingdom was
[10:22] taking about what force
[10:25] so we take it but we put it here how-to
[10:28] up here if we put it up here then we do
[10:30] this right here we esteem ourselves
[10:32] better than other thing you can't do
[10:33] that not as a Christian right I mean you
[10:37] may start out that way but this is what
[10:38] this is for like just retreat II said
[10:42] you just got that patients run ten
[10:44] minutes that's having one patience with
[10:46] God because Paul look at verse 4 when
[10:53] we're talking look not every man on his
[10:54] own things but every man also on the
[10:56] things of others our interest of others
[10:59] let this mind be in you what this this
[11:02] mind be in you which also it was also in
[11:07] Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[11:10] God thought it not robbery in other
[11:13] words he didn't take anything from God
[11:15] to become God he was God he was God so
[11:20] you guys see the same thing thing
[11:21] because if that might have a crisis in
[11:23] you that makes you Christ okay
[11:25] alright my brother Marcus was talking
[11:27] about that headstone I like that chart
[11:29] that he had up there that was good he's
[11:31] a studied man he's he's though he's a
[11:34] Holy Ghost field German who being in the
[11:38] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[11:40] equal with God evil yes equal but made
[11:44] himself of no reputation and took upon
[11:46] him the form of a servant and was made
[11:49] in the likeness of men so that's this
[11:51] time of the year that everybody says
[11:53] that Jesus was born oh you seen a paper
[11:55] today they found another really they
[11:56] found some wooden piece of something
[11:58] that was supposed to been in the manger
[11:59] so the Catholic Church is having this
[12:02] you know probably having this 50 million
[12:04] dollar parade that they're gonna parade
[12:06] it down through Jerusalem and put it
[12:09] into one of the whatever the mains they
[12:11] think you know there's like three
[12:12] different places they supposedly the
[12:14] manger was so I don't know which one
[12:16] they gonna put it in anyway that's
[12:18] relics and they called it a relic so I
[12:21] worry about relics I'm gonna be right
[12:24] here
[12:28] well if you they say that the art was
[12:32] met found on Mount Ararat or whatever
[12:34] that place was and they were still would
[12:35] there would which preserve preserving
[12:39] well they call it sacrifice that's most
[12:43] of us most of us to get older we're
[12:45] better like beautified yeah
[12:49] but wood petrified yeah some piece and
[12:52] you know what it's just Tennyson's
[12:55] somebody comes up with it found it in
[12:57] the closet really I mean come on is
[13:00] really they found it in the closet said
[13:02] well this must been part of the manger
[13:03] but supposedly listen then this company
[13:06] I'm trying to not be funny
[13:08] what happened was though in 650 ad which
[13:13] was 600 years left
[13:16] this was supposedly given to a pope when
[13:20] the Muslims started building the mosque
[13:22] of Omar and Israel they find this place
[13:26] or this piece of wood so they give it to
[13:28] Pope Theodore the first I think I don't
[13:30] want to have a Pope Theodore
[13:32] I don't think of Theodore in the Bible
[13:34] and then now the Catholic Church is
[13:36] giving it back to the Christians but you
[13:39] know I have the right of the paper told
[13:41] me this morning that there's only like
[13:43] 10% of Christians and they live in
[13:45] Jerusalem
[13:46] 10% the rest are Muslims and all
[13:50] different factions Islam or in Jerusalem
[13:55] and of course the Jews don't care they
[13:56] don't believe in nothing right so and so
[13:59] the Jews beloved that don't laugh
[14:01] they're blinded that's right
[14:03] 144,000 is somewhere inside that Middle
[14:06] East circle rub there even Iran Iraq in
[14:09] different places that are coming by but
[14:12] the Jews inside the city they really
[14:14] don't care and the good prophets are in
[14:17] there somewhere so you know they're
[14:18] there but you know what they're there
[14:20] because they're there dormant because
[14:24] we're still here they're laying there
[14:27] dormant because we're still here
[14:29] once we leave buddy they've only got
[14:31] three and a half
[14:32] years to get a hundred and forty-four
[14:34] thousand believers born-again no it's a
[14:47] melting pot no well everybody wants to
[14:50] be there cuz this even though they don't
[14:52] believe it that's the holiest place in
[14:54] the earth yeah yeah like Mecca is to the
[14:57] whoever that the Muhammad
[14:59] yeah like mecca of the muhammadans
[15:01] here's a list to the Christians but
[15:03] Christians don't go and reside there
[15:05] they go and visit in anyway because I
[15:07] think they just both doors cemented em
[15:09] just got back from that they go in
[15:11] October I think or november somewhere
[15:12] like that but he'll take 40 or 50 people
[15:14] over there and I'll just I just think I
[15:18] want to go over there reside there
[15:19] Saunders wait till the Millennium I
[15:21] won't have to fly back I will have to
[15:24] fly back would it stay there for all
[15:25] time then we're just going to be lifted
[15:28] up in another dimension God got a lot
[15:29] better off a brand new city down around
[15:31] the same place that's right yeah and you
[15:36] went when she called you and told you
[15:38] about it no okay yeah oh yeah okay let's
[15:43] get back Leon we got over a betrayal
[15:45] there for a minute all right but made
[15:47] himself of no reputation and took upon
[15:50] him the form of a servant that's why I
[15:53] hope everybody realizes that to be to
[15:57] have the mind of Christ that's what he
[15:59] said right right then then to have the
[16:02] mind of Christ makes you a servant I
[16:04] serve it to water serve it to the center
[16:07] I serve it to the even the born-again I
[16:09] serve it to all while we're down here
[16:12] there's no great ones among us brother
[16:14] Graham said he doesn't know God's no
[16:16] respecter of person so we should be a
[16:18] respected person all right
[16:21] but being and was made in the likeness
[16:23] of men of course he was made in the
[16:24] likeness of men and being found in
[16:28] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[16:31] became obedient unto death even the
[16:33] death of the Cross and I've been reading
[16:34] back through my
[16:35] Luke and done and the accountant just
[16:39] read them making my living done again
[16:40] and you see how Jesus brother Brown said
[16:43] and Jesus did fight it out on the cross
[16:45] he followed her down the garden gets
[16:47] then when he got out before
[16:48] that's where he fought her down he said
[16:50] father not my will but thy will be done
[16:52] he totally subjected himself knowing
[16:54] what was coming now he mean what was
[16:57] coming but that time he said my or is
[16:59] coming so that day he knew he was going
[17:02] to die because two days before that he
[17:05] said he sent as he was going to go up to
[17:07] Jerusalem and be betrayed and all this
[17:08] you know them
[17:09] that's when Peter said no that ain't
[17:11] gonna have Lord he said get behind me
[17:12] Satan continued you read the book of
[17:15] Mark where he goes to the Garden of
[17:18] Gethsemane in three times he goes and
[17:20] prays trying to get that off of him the
[17:23] burden he was again he was in his
[17:25] humanity he'd never seen that he never
[17:28] felt that he God never felt this and I
[17:31] didn't die but the human body that he
[17:34] was then died it died dead as a hammer
[17:36] brother Brent said laid cold in the
[17:38] grave all right but remember he'd come
[17:42] by and picked up by you up glorified it
[17:43] and now he's forevermore King potentate
[17:50] king of heaven or authority and being
[17:53] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[17:55] himself and became obedient unto death
[17:57] even the death of the cross
[17:59] wherefore God also hath highly exalted
[18:02] him and given him a name which is above
[18:04] every name that at the name of Jesus
[18:07] every knee should bow of things let's
[18:10] see what things mean those under the
[18:16] earth and that every tongue should
[18:19] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[18:22] brother brown says everybody is going to
[18:26] have to confess that one way the other
[18:28] we confess it here we can own our knees
[18:31] and pray here and we confess that Jesus
[18:33] Christ is Lord but going there you get
[18:35] to the other when you get to the white
[18:37] throne judgment every knees gonna bow
[18:39] and every time
[18:40] that's that that man was sent to save
[18:42] the world and they turned me down
[18:44] collects the realization of they'll have
[18:46] it's that they turned it down that every
[18:49] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[18:50] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[18:53] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[18:55] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[18:59] now much more in my absence work out
[19:03] your own salvation with fear and Finland
[19:06] in other words Paulo saying look I'm
[19:07] separated from you I'm not your
[19:10] salvation brother they don't not your
[19:13] salvation he helps you after you're safe
[19:16] he's not your salvation he said you work
[19:18] out your own salvation with fear and
[19:20] trembling then you come back and then
[19:21] we'll teach you like I was telling the
[19:23] church in Kentucky last week you know
[19:26] meaning all those beautiful girls that
[19:28] are sitting there fifteen sixteen year
[19:29] old girl with us said they were
[19:30] beautiful little children when they were
[19:32] born
[19:34] momma's did you put them in the closet
[19:36] or did you build them playing around
[19:39] them and put plaster over them and say
[19:40] that's the prettiest baby there was and
[19:42] come back 15 years later where you got
[19:44] no you got a nursery you got feed it you
[19:47] got to teach it same way with God when
[19:50] you're newborn babes in Christ you're
[19:51] just like a baby that's being born
[19:53] you're helpless you just know you're
[19:56] born you're breathing do you need help
[19:58] you cry that's why the Bible says we
[19:59] will see the spirit of adoption where we
[20:01] cry where about we cry and my father but
[20:04] now josh is not going to come back home
[20:06] with us tomorrow or tonight and getting
[20:08] Jim's lap he's pibe now and she's gonna
[20:13] rock him to sleep there's a problem with
[20:15] that if it happens it's not normal but
[20:18] why he's grown same way we're doing the
[20:21] Christian world we have to grow we have
[20:24] to grow up and God that's what this is
[20:26] this is the growth part of your
[20:27] Christian journey sure you're born again
[20:30] down here with faith but these things
[20:33] have got to be added just like you add
[20:35] kindergarten first grade second grade
[20:37] third grade fourth all the way up that's
[20:41] what Paul's talking about
[20:45] wherefore my beloved as you have always
[20:47] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[20:50] now much more in my absence what's Paul
[20:54] done
[20:54] he's birthed them I suppose she the
[20:59] Christ a chaste virgin right but now
[21:02] even in my absence you guys need to grow
[21:05] grow up you know that's why I said about
[21:09] many times we we try to get the
[21:11] preachers to save our kids and to say
[21:13] that's your part like if we're going to
[21:15] talk about this revival nothing brother
[21:17] Dale can do nothing I can do nothing God
[21:20] can do you say nothing yes he is a you
[21:23] are free moral agent there is nothing
[21:25] god I'll read you the quote from brother
[21:27] Graham saying God cannot start a revival
[21:29] he walks to Amen but you start to revive
[21:36] the revival is starting into start an
[21:39] individual brother man since then it
[21:41] works into the preaching
[21:42] I mean works into the church and it
[21:44] works into the preaching we're totally
[21:45] backwards from what we're used to we're
[21:48] used to offset in there you know and I'm
[21:50] just going to put this it's y'all it's
[21:51] not literal but you're sitting there
[21:53] numb brain you know because you don't
[21:55] know what's coming day you don't know
[21:56] what that will avail station to teach
[21:58] right so you're sitting there open you
[22:00] know you're sitting there you're not
[22:01] thinking about anything but now it's got
[22:04] to be a reversal you've got to start
[22:07] thinking about what you want that's
[22:09] right man
[22:11] you not start saying about what you you
[22:13] know why this role reversal that's
[22:14] what's going to get us out of here for
[22:16] 2,000 years we've been rolling in this
[22:18] direction all preachers say my children
[22:21] you know old Catholic Church you know
[22:23] say throw the water and throw the salt
[22:25] throw them preached you pray for my kids
[22:28] you know confessed no you confess the
[22:30] gun so now what we're gonna do is change
[22:33] it we're gonna have a little role
[22:34] reversal do where you're gonna have to
[22:36] start something yeah cuz I'll read you
[22:38] her brother Ram saves about 18 times
[22:40] listen they was 15 20 571 quotes
[22:44] revival and revived it being brother
[22:45] very messy I ready everyone and brother
[22:49] Brennaman all his talk he says God
[22:52] cannot start he wants to but he did not
[22:54] start one reliable man started the
[22:58] revival when they cried out for
[23:00] something is real for 400 years cried
[23:04] for a deliverer finally they got fed up
[23:06] and said hey we need somebody now so we
[23:09] know what we need a body change now when
[23:11] he died to come on the scene in the
[23:12] third Pole we need God to manifest the
[23:14] things that he said he might fit and
[23:16] it's not gonna be a public show so I'm
[23:17] gonna be healing lines that's what
[23:20] people think of robot oh listen I'm
[23:22] preaching my sermon forget again what
[23:24] you just heard as the prosecutor says
[23:27] forget what you just heard and we'll
[23:30] talk about this afternoon you come for a
[23:37] reliable yeah inside of you remind what
[23:40] you got no no that's not questions and
[23:44] answers as well yes you do you start to
[23:47] revival I'll explain to you sorry yes
[24:00] that's where it starts that's why it's
[24:03] gonna get a little testy maybe this
[24:04] afternoon but that's okay we need a
[24:07] stone guy start somewhere well my
[24:09] beloved as you have always obeyed
[24:10] listened not as in my presence all but
[24:12] now much more in my absence like I said
[24:15] before it's easy it's easy to live a
[24:17] Christian life right here you've got all
[24:18] Christians around him you've got
[24:20] wonderful aura of anointing and you've
[24:23] got the light here but take it out there
[24:26] Monday morning
[24:27] deliver all the time if you don't work
[24:29] online this way and I'll have a buggy I
[24:34] mean a truck full of them and I'll have
[24:36] it about two more hours that are going
[24:38] to my route that's when it gets the more
[24:42] much more in my absence work out your
[24:46] own salvation within family for it is
[24:48] God which worketh in you both to will
[24:51] and to do of his good pleasure we're
[24:54] going to look at this afternoon too you
[24:56] can't start a revival unless you've got
[24:58] something already side to you number of
[25:01] reps I didn't catch the center and brand
[25:03] the center took to a knowledge of sin
[25:07] but you can't call for a revival and not
[25:09] be born again oh you got called for
[25:13] going to save you first this is a whole
[25:16] different thinking than what we've been
[25:18] thinking you got a call you can't set
[25:20] that call for a revival and there's
[25:21] nothing in you to revive it just be
[25:25] playing if you're not born again you
[25:26] dead right that's called a resurrection
[25:29] that's not a reliable because remember
[25:33] that you know what we're resurrected
[25:34] sitting then we're resurrected when
[25:36] we're born again what we died buried
[25:38] resurrected then we can be revived or
[25:41] have a rebuy ball in our heart all right
[25:45] it may take a while to change our our
[25:48] old way of thinking but maybe that's
[25:51] what we need you know I think it is all
[25:53] up where it is God which worketh in you
[25:55] both to will and to do of his good
[25:57] pleasure now listen don't be so
[26:00] narrow-minded you say well you're the
[26:02] one starts a revival remember what I
[26:04] said is the Holy Ghost inside of you
[26:07] that's calling for the revival but it's
[26:09] calling for it through you be not
[26:12] through the preaching it's calling it
[26:14] through the laity in the church you're
[26:17] calling for a rip listen Israel call for
[26:19] a long time I don't say 400 years but
[26:22] they call for a revival
[26:24] God sent it at the very end and he let
[26:27] him stay down there 430 years thirty
[26:30] years past the time and even Moses got
[26:33] caught up and had to go back in the
[26:34] wilderness for 40 more years
[26:36] before you deliver them so they waited a
[26:39] long time and I think we've waited 50
[26:40] years now since the profits going go
[26:43] they thought though you had that revival
[26:44] back then now here I'm going preaching
[26:46] again stop that do all things without
[26:48] murmuring and disputing boy I wish we
[26:50] could handle that them that you may be
[26:53] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[26:56] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[26:59] and perverse nation now boy brother Ram
[27:02] sedition was the most wicked age so you
[27:04] are you are that right there in the
[27:07] midst of a crooked and perverse nation
[27:09] among whom ye shine as lights in the
[27:14] world holding forth the word of truth
[27:17] just like a city living it without
[27:19] having without being in turns it's easy
[27:22] to live it here living it out there
[27:25] holding forth the word of life excuse me
[27:30] that I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[27:32] that I have not run in vain neither
[27:35] labored in vain we can all say that hey
[27:40] Paul I don't know I don't know Paul
[27:43] stood next in hey I'm the first Turkish
[27:44] messenger I don't know that he had that
[27:46] revelation but he knew that what he was
[27:49] saying was going to be written yeah I
[27:52] mean put in them you know ages ages
[27:55] could read it
[27:56] I believe God revealed that telling day
[27:58] hey this is going to be my written word
[28:00] and you're gonna write it down and we're
[28:03] gonna put it in the Bible all right I
[28:04] believe he knew that but now how it
[28:07] ended up he looked through a glass
[28:08] darkly he couldn't see everything like I
[28:10] said before Paul was dead thirty years
[28:12] before John went to Patmos and God
[28:14] revealed the sails to our showed him the
[28:16] seals Paul had nothing Paul didn't know
[28:19] about a wild horse rider read horse
[28:20] rider black horse rider and all that he
[28:22] didn't know anything about that but what
[28:24] he done though he preached the
[28:25] foundation one great prophet here like I
[28:29] said before one great prophet here one
[28:31] great prophet up there now we know our
[28:34] ranch in Martin but number remember
[28:36] Luther and Wesley weren't prophets now
[28:37] he'll call them prophets but there were
[28:39] reformers
[28:40] okay reformers but they had to be
[28:44] followed a reformer he was restoring
[28:48] China baggage he was restoring us back
[28:50] to what this foundation of faith okay
[28:52] then he got lost in the ages and God had
[28:55] to send another major prophet India time
[28:58] to turn us back to what here plus this
[29:01] right God puts blessing there remember
[29:05] them extra mile come forward and do two
[29:07] things one returns back to here and
[29:10] bring us up to here and then reveal the
[29:13] seven thunders for the seals that were
[29:14] contained that nobody had ever seen God
[29:17] had to hand over their eyes just like
[29:20] you did the Jews all right so we're
[29:23] gonna stop adversity extinct we're gonna
[29:24] go on it today we're gonna hold the
[29:26] temper things well it's 10:15 exactly so
[29:29] let's go up there
