see him don't you you know ours fights closing out everything's moving in the right direction so we're looking forward to his coming because it's got to be in there somewhere it's not a uh time it's it's you know we don't look for a date or a time but we we know it will happen because he promised it to us amen good to see everybody in the house lord glad to have our visitor back there with us you know a couple of visitors maybe and we always say to you welcome when you come one time here when you come back you're just part of us so just make yourself to home amen just pray one for another you heard all the requests we got a report that brother homer longoria that they had to take him to the emergency room or to the hospital uh last night he's not doing too good i talked to him over there there a few days ago and he said he was just having a lot of problems and things would just bother me and hold you know and then talk to brother altic and he said he's still having problems with just a weakness that he can't uh you know he can't just keep on going he'd walk a little bit and everything else but just remember these brother homer's a lot of hills there's things that he's had he's got some kind of a assist that they're dealing with and and things and and uh a lot of things in his life that's he's got that what do you call it copd or something and all of that so just just keep brother homer in your mind and pray the lord would bless amen so it's good to see everybody in the house of the lord hebrews 10 5 and then we'll go to ephesians the lord jesus we thank you that there is a time and an opportunity that we can bow our humble heads and call out to a living god we can remember these that are sick and we can pray for them and ask you to come on the scene and deliver each one father we believe you we know that by your stripes brother homer's healed brother altig these brothers and the sisters and things around the country that has got this old virus dealing and problems with it we pray that you would just come on the scene and fulfill your word because you said you would always be with us you never let things come on us that we would not be able to stand so we believe you and we thank you as we read your word you come to the point lord to reveal yourself and make a make us to be to the point that we want to more just know about you is our desire forgive our sins cleanse us and bless each one and guide each and every one need just lead the sick and have your way in your love we know it's one of your attributes to display a healer so we don't have to worry about asking and wondering if it can be done we know it is already finished and we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen hebrews we've been on this for a little while and i don't know how much more we'll stay but we'll go to verse 3 of hebrews 10. but in those sacrifices there's a remembrance you know the the law of the shadows and the things again made of sins every year see it just keeps piling up it's no good all right for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body has thou prepared me a way for a redeemer to be made manifest and come forth was made possible in the lord jesus okay let's go to ephesians 5 what have we got um 10 22 22 all right let's go verse 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands into in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctified and cleanse it with a washing of the water of the word let's just stop there because we know what it's dealing with because we're talking about and want to talk today a little bit about the body and things and we know that paul was using the wife and the husband as a type of christ in the church because that's what we want to deal with today we want to talk about the body and dealing with it and knowing that uh there had to be a an atonement made so as it was then jesus christ the human body came into existence to pay the price all right so then that's not all of it either because see god can't be without a body once he unites or brings himself forth into a position or situation or character or attribute or whatever words you want to use once he comes to that place he cannot back up it will always be there because when even when we get there it won't do away because we're going to see the nail prints in his hand now that's something isn't it to where that we'll know all about it okay you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word you know that's what i want to do i want us to think on the body because god cannot be without a body now when he was back before the foundation of the world and dealing with that and coming down uh he had a body he lived in a body but that body was not a human element 16 elements as we call it not a human body it was a body it was a place that he lived he dwelt there and and i believe that he was you know uh in what we would call to come on later picking up the word theophany or something like that to try to express it but to me it's the best way to express it is just to think about it a little bit because he had to come forth to be able to make the atonement all right and pay the price and to do that and see then we've been through studying about adam and how that god made him and things happened back there and then see we was we dwelt a long time i sometimes i want to just sit down and uh maybe it would be good to just say it like this and i will because i think about it that a lot is just sit down and put step one step two step three four five and come through the bible and to see the the natural things that have taken place you know the atonements the things the the crucifixions the things like that that were natural things to transpire that god had in his mind as wade was bringing out there the other night no wednesday you know of being in his mind and in that part then uh you know you can see that he had these things in his mind but then he would bring it forth into a natural thing and then you can read the bible i see the problem with people trying to read the bible is they're trying to figure out what it's saying amen there let me be an odd way of doing what i approach it but i always approach everything kind of odd anyway but you know we're not supposed to try to figure out the bible we're supposed to read it believe it study it thank god for it and just let it be there with us all the way through and and it's not something that we do but there is a natural story i was thinking a lot about this recently the bible has a natural story natural things if you'd read it like that and read that here is this and here is this and here's this and here comes adam and here comes eve and here comes those were things that were natural happenings and it came all the way through that you had a david you had all of the the things you had a goliath you had a killing and all like that you had those were natural things all right and see pointing on down and then finally here would come jesus christ into the world in a human form as a natural person you know a human being amen he just wouldn't come in there and then just stand up and you know well i'm it couldn't be touched or whatever no he had that story about him it's a natural there's a natural story to the bible and when you're reading it if you just read it and say well you know this took place this happened here's where david come in and look what he'd done and look what happened and look like the things that he'd done and all like that and look at abraham a friend of god look at all of the things that took place in the time as what we call the bible as it's being made being written or brought into being you know and see it didn't end when jesus christ came that was the fulfillment of it to bring it into being to where we could see more our day well you know what i think about is is what we've we've talked about in in the past few services on back about you know we talk about the the the woman in the white house well we're living in a day and i tried to explain it then we're living in a day when literally the bible is still being written you realize by that being prophesied by the prophet that they'd come that time then that would have to take place because it's the word of god and then being in having to take place see then it would be something natural all right something natural would have to take place there would have to be a time that there'd be a lady in the white house well then that puts us living exactly the word of god as it's being written it's still being written every time a born-again believer comes into the body of christ you realize that you're doing the the scripture wade was using the other day and was with the incontinence was my members fashion when you back there you know and each one coming forth and as each person comes into the body of christ except in jesus christ that's part of the bible being fulfilled why don't you think of yourself like that we're living in a time when it is being made manifest it's not just talking about it we read about it we talked about the woman in the white house we laughed at the uh that it couldn't be a pretty hillary because he was too ugly and we we've done all the natural things but you know what it's reality that's right read the bible like a a book that's being written now see when you come into the body of christ that puts your name in the book amen right this just trying to get you to think about something because you know that's the way it is see god can't he doesn't exist or unless our word can't to a lot of people knocks them in the head and they they think well you're saying that god can't do this no god won't do it all right god exists in a situation to where that he can manifest himself any way he wants to but yet he can't come no other way than what the word says so if we see our day where are days in the word it's written see what's taking place today is in the word yes all right see then uh you know we we can look forward uh peggy was asking me some questions the other day about the uh the tribulation and the pre-tribulations and and the things you know and we we just begin to talk about uh things that uh could be expected see we're not in the tribulation don't think that if we're in the tribulation we don't miss the rapture but just remember like i've always tried to tell you see we look at things and and we see something and and we try to figure it out well i've just always just been natural in my thinking and if you'll be natural into reading the bible then it can be made manifest or known what it's talking about because see you you'd come through the bible just i'm hung on this so i'm gonna get it out of the way uh you take see you've got the creation of the world and then you got adam and eve created well see that's not an addition to the bible but it is one thing for certain adam and eve came forth into a physical manifestation amen you know alive they became alive all right see then they can can be alive and we can go through a lot of the others but now here's my point the god back before the world he was an elohim the self-existing the great i am the great jehovah god and he wanted to dwell with his people he was lonely he wanted to dwell with his people all right so we begin to bring forth his thoughts he began to bring forth his uh manifestations and bring it into being all right and here as those things are brought into being we can see how he unfolds himself and coming down to where we're living so god has never been to the basis that he didn't have a body now now here's we're going to start with that just a little bit and try to get on it but he's never been to a place that he didn't have a body it may not have been a 16 element you know he may have existed in a theophany but the prophet called that a body he may have existed in other forms but the thing about it was he existed he had a body but that was not the way that he wanted it so he turned it around and began to manifest it the way that he wanted it as i was going to say about adam and eve you see a natural story over here but then here comes a spiritual happening then you start thinking about adam and eve and you start thinking about the the times and the creation and what it was and you begin to see how they lived and see how that we can live and how our being all right get the point now see god has always had a body all right but never had it like he wanted it because he could not make manifest all of his attributes right until he come forth into a manifestation and and say the healer the deliverer there's the savior the attributes and the things that god would uh bring forth you know and make manifest in in in life and see as he's doing that he's writing the bible so that we later could be able to read that and see that there was a living reality back there like i said god had a body he had a way of living he lived in a form back there before that he ever started creating anything i don't think he was just a wind blowing and just floating around and just something like that you know the prophet said he's a being so he's not like the wind he said well at one time he was like no he never was a time that god was not real that's where we try to figure out there's where we read the story then we try to comprehend the story without going to a spiritual revelation to understand what's going on we're going to the point of trying to figure it out ourselves all right but you see he's always had a way of living it wasn't that he was non-existent then he come into existence i've never believed nothing like that because if he ever was god he still is god now we know we use the word god okay see we're so smart we use the word well he wasn't god god is an object of worship see you're getting into those that are saying a moment ago trying to figure things out when brother branham would say god well he's not god see we're so smart but brother random had a way of preaching he said god was the self-existing god was the great elohim god was not he didn't have no problem using the word god but yet we're actually correcting him in the basis of us saying well but god's not god until he created some all right the prophet said the first thing he created was angels he said that made him god said they worshipped him all right but if you think about the children of god the children of god existed before the angels so now you've got two creations that's what i'm telling you we try to figure things out instead of just accepting it like it is and read it the bible the message the thing read it and let god then come on the scene in that and reveal himself through that to me and you because that's what we're here for he created us for a purpose then he began his own part of bringing his own self into being where we could see something tangible see something real all right see that's why i said don't ever think that there was a time that god didn't exist well how did he exist he existed the way he needed to be or was you say you mean to tell me that you think that god one time existed i do what do you think where did he come from and what is your thoughts i believe that back before the foundation of the world and all i can that god was there more real than you and me are now but he was existing alone he had the attributes within him right and he wanted to display them and you know to bring him out that was great but he existed alone but yet he did exist and he had a body to live in back there but not the kind of body that he wanted to do all right see even adam and eve in the way that they done and sinned he didn't want that sinful body but yet it was placed in there all right but see one day something happened now here's my point that all that's to say one thing when i read in hebrews 10 5 there and it says a body has thou prepared me god provided his own body adam and eve didn't create him a body mary never created him a body we can't create him a body but yet if we go along with the story of what we're looking at and see how he come into manifestation you can see that still he is here now in his body and this is the body that he wanted to have here well i don't have a problem with this old flesh my brother uh richard wilson used to like cause some of us to say it he said y'all said old flush flush the flesh you know but think about it what i'm trying to get a point to you is one thing don't think god had a beginning he never had a beginning he always was god all right now don't think that there was a time that he didn't exist in a body he existed in a bodily form back but a bodily form that's different from this form you can call it a theophany you can call it those things you know the one i like is to get into those words like that and look up logos and find out the word logos means speech that's a thrill to me to know that that word word is speech all right god was real that's that's my whole point i was trying to get a little little statement in right here then we'll start reading something god is real he never existed to worry that he was not real that's right he was real all right see then he began to he was not satisfied to stay in that position or situation or whatever you want to call it he didn't want to stay that way he had his thoughts he created angels he had a lot of things that he created right well yet he wasn't happy he was living there in a body but he wasn't satisfied in that form he wanted to be kin folks you know what see everybody now wants to try to find out who their ancestors are you know i mean i get tickled at all that they don't find out who they are and they find out who they are they want to deny them but uh you know but think about it god wanted to make himself tangible he could live in a in an existing situation with us he did with adam and eve in the garden he come down in the cool of the day so then he had a body in the garden when he walked with them but he wasn't satisfied see that shows my point of what i'm talking about that god always existed in a body god always had some form or bodily form but the difference is in the elements and the different things see while he was there in the garden with adam and eve he was not in a 16-element physical body but yet he was real if they could talk to him he could fellowship with him so the body he had back there was a wonderful situation but it was not what he wanted to stay he didn't want to stay to the bases that he just had adam and eve to the point like that and he could come down every day it was all coming forth to what he wanted he wanted a family he wanted people he wanted somebody to love him the angels they were created they could worship him but that was still not what he wanted they said adam and eve they could do this that the other and worship god that wasn't still within it he had to allow sin to enter the picture he had to allow sin to enter the picture to where he could come forth and manifest himself in the way he wanted that odd he had to permit sin to enter the picture to bring forth the body that he wanted us to be in he doesn't want us today just being a theophany floating around or this that or the other we're not supposed to be there we're human beings we're the children of god hmm but think about it god has always had some form whatever that you could call a body but then he makes emphasis and shows us that a body that's stuff provided me god made a body through the virgin birth through the not a creating remember how we kept bringing those things out adam and eve created full-grown and i created a baby then grown up but jesus was begotten and he started life as a baby but you know what there was jehovah laying in a cradle there was the body that he wanted then he would have to wait and let that body grow up let that age come on and let the things happen and it looks like that he ordered just to wipe this off and wipe that off and and made the whole thing come out right no he that wouldn't have been what he wanted now i i want you to think with me on something that the way that here this whole human mind thinks you know there's no other way now listen there's no other way this thing could have happened than the way it happened now let that's just just let that thought run through your mind if there was any other way of doing it he would have done it that way so even sin entering the picture as i've always said tried to quote to you that brother ryan said god did not curse eve and adam how could he curse him when he'd already put eternal life in their soul that's why i emphasized that so much he put that eternal life he couldn't curse them brother run said he can't curse you he said you got eternal life thank you that's a wonderful situation but see what i'm talking about the scripture says a body thou has provided it finally came after a four thousand year period it came to a being that would be the one that would be the body like he wanted all right so he brought into being a body that he could come and dwell in it had to wait a while for all the things to made manifest i tried to preach that to you where like the river jordans and the things like that sure those things are great he wasn't the great eternal elohim self-existing almighty god in manifestation on the river jordan he was a human being but god was dwelling in there that was the elohim that self-existing the almighty the old thing was dwelling in that body see i'm trying to preach the god head if you understand what i've been trying to do to understand that he's father son and holy ghost and without those three attributes he's not real all right see then he comes down and he brings into being the body that he desired that body that was hebrews 10 5 is speaking of that a body thou hast provided that was god's plan and purpose he was going to make that body bring it into being so he's always had a body it's just the way we use the terms and the thoughts we think well no he was just back there he just floating around he was just he just wasn't done no no whatever he was back there is more real than we are now see to think about now the body that thou has provided god provided a body and that body was the lord jesus christ in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily in that body and that body was not eternal because it had a beginning all right one day he was crucified went to the grave all the things but when he come forth from there and ascended on high there is when he reached his position of a body because there it was all made eternal see that's the point i'm trying to get if you don't forget anything get out of the messy today you get one thing god has a plan and purpose for you i'll give you the quote where the prophet was talking about it in the fullness of the godhead bodily he said he couldn't do it in the days of luther he said he couldn't do it in the days of wesley that he couldn't do it in the days of the pentecostal couldn't do what couldn't bring forth the way he wanted see you and i when we walk off of this earth in a glorified condition then the body of god will be in reality oh that just runs all the way that way and goes all the way that way but see a body has not provided for me that's what jesus was saying was he speaking to another person was he trying to figure it out with the second or third person what to do or whatever now there's where we have to take the story and let the prophet explain because we can't do it as i said we try to make these things we can't do it that's what i'm talking about the bible read the bible naturally just read it naturally and you'll see the most marvelous beautiful picture that starts out there in genesis and it begins to unfold and all of these people that have lived and been part of god's plan they're just making it manifest you and i are making it manifest now see we've got to we've got to be to the basis that we've got to have the change of these bodies because it won't fit this way all right that's fine we just have a change in the body but the thing about it is we've got to first get to the point that that we can realize and believe that we are the body of christ come on church wake up to one point we baptist taught that the bride we didn't know the word the bride we called it the church but we taught that that christ would come and live in a person and once that would be finished then we would all go to a glorified state somewhere in a glory land oh happy hunting ground of the indian or whatever it was we taught those things we talked about a change see see then when i read it where it says the body thou hast provided me i see god provided a fleshly human element a body that we call jesus right he created that and brought it into being that was the body that he wanted yeah we had already messed up the story the the picture was already in bad shape you know the cap and the tree and all of that and the other we don't have everything messed up because we tried to figure it out ourselves if you understand what i'm talking about start reading in genesis and then just just let your mind float and just go from genesis and the things that's happening and then jump over to abraham about 12 13 14. getting on into there you see a spiritual thing taking place you see something is marvelously happening that the word of god has told you the literal things it ain't going to put us in the rapture for the white house to be full of women i mean i don't care if they get a half a dozen presidents and what they do i'm not against none of that i have nothing no problems but i know one thing for certain that's not going to put me in the rapture but when i come to the place that i finally come to the situation that there's a reality of revelation into my heart that i am god's body now come on jesus is not here if he was here he couldn't be here in a physical body right is that that's the way the prophet explains it he you know he said these people saying they got blood running out and he said no i said if you've done that said you'd have jesus in the literal and he said you can't do that but you just think about we are the body of christ i can take this here's the book here's what i'm talking about reading this and coming through it take this and read what the prophet had to say about how jesus came and what he was that he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a human flesh called the son of god i thought we were his children then we would be the sons and daughters of the living god as paul was doing to them on mars hill he said some of your points have said we are you are we are his offspring we are the children of god we are the people that couldn't happen in the days of luther they never had the revelation correct about the chains of different things because like i said we could talk about these things in the baptists and all but we still couldn't see it because we couldn't get the godhead straight we couldn't get the rest of the word straight but we have no excuse now we have the prophet's message we have no excuse to say i can't understand or it's just a mystery to me about god what is a mystery a mystery is something that is withholding until our revelation comes but when the revelation comes it's not a mystery anymore see a body jesus came to a position there that he lived in a human body he growed up he became the sacrifice and looked like he was destroying the thing did he come to do because he just gave his life because now listen what i'm saying he gave his life so the next stage of the story would be correct that it could be that a body thou has provided me jesus was that human body right in him with the whole reconciling the world all the time god was in christ doing those things but when he died and resurrected he's not here in a physical form he's not you're in a corporal body right but he has a body who is it we are his body we've always taught that when are we going to believe it we've always talked about the body of christ preached about it taught about it sung about it wrote songs great things just about the body of christ because when it happened there what would have took place had he went back up and and didn't have a body so he went up and a few days later he came back he came back to a body called the church the bride of christ he wouldn't left without a body and he says about this body that the greater things that we could do than what he done and we argue about what that means instead of reading what the prophet says about it and knowing what it means we know he's saying that it was in many members over here whereas the lord jesus was just one you see church we talk about the body we talk about what it is but we are his body and the way i think of it is like this i think of it in one way because here is my point we come to a day in time we can say well this could mean this and this could mean that and and my brother you want to go talk to him he'll say it like this he'll say uh um well those virgins all over the world but there's many virgin girls had babies i said you just lied and he's a 14-year theologian in the methodist seminary i said you just lied i said because that can't be well you know we had neighbors down there that had that had babies and never had no husband i said they lied i said that ain't the point the point is the virgin birth is for the one lord jesus christ now we have a spiritual birth that brings us into a virgin condition existence the born-again believer see he just stepped out of that body you say well people that say you know well if if jesus was god how could he die he didn't die jesus jesus would be the the god when you're using it but then it turns right back around and saying that jesus is the body see it's according what you're talking about see i don't have to look in a mirror to try to figure out and go in the bathroom you know and look up who am i praying to today well i got a picture here i got a picture here got a yeah i got one of brother random oh here we'll try that out in a while you say you're joking you're crazy no i ain't because that's what we do but listen church the lord jesus christ was the body of god it was the situation coming to existence that god could live with man god could come down and live with man that he could dwell with us and he could call us his children see he never left then without a body because quick as that body left and exited out and went up in the resurrection a few days later here he comes back into the body now i'm going to say this so i want you to listen see on the day of pentecost come into reality the body as well as what the bible said a body thou has prepared me because on the day of pentecost a bride came forth a church a bride came forth to be the people of god to be his children to be his offspring to be his body that he could live in so he wasn't left without a body you are his body when are we going to realize that and think about us as being reality and real as i'm saying a minute ago and seeing things in our day that we can say the prophet stood and told us these things oh you can argue what he said it like this one time he said in 50 something he said russia's got jet airplanes we knew that because you know the the when they divided what was it berlin or whatever they got so many of the scientists we got so many of the scientists and and they were smart the russians got a lot of those things but he said they had flying saucers right what about your prophet talking about flying saucers oh they're just a physicist of your imagination that is he talked about it you know what that was to me writing of the bible but then here one day comes forth a statement that a woman will be in the white house oh can't be done that was back before the what what is that word suffering or whatever what it means is women's right to vote i wonder how many of you women think about what brother branham said and i'm not against this that or the other i don't vote i don't fool with none of that i just try to preach to get you to see who you are brother brown said the worst mistake that was ever made was giving the woman the right to vote now how many of you women thinking about that i don't like that i don't i don't he could have said it some other way well if i was a woman then i just wasn't fooled with going down and registered to vote but that's my privilege silly too you say are you against women voting no they got no problem i got one thing for sure by the women voting came to pass what the prophet said oh if the women had not had the right to vote they would have never been a woman in the white house so the prophet would have been wrong when he said a woman in the white house do you get what i'm talking about see by the giving the right to the women to vote they brought in all of the things that's not being against it i don't even vote myself that's what i'm saying that's your privilege i ain't saying for nobody not to vote or to vote or whatever to do i'm trying to preach something to get us to see who we are now wouldn't it be a shame for somebody to come up and here i've been pastoring a church now for 40 years and and here they come up with something try to give me a special deal let me run for president because i've been pastoring that's a disgrace you're asking me to run for president well brother dale you can get things strained out no we know better than that in office ever no george washington never office we don't heard the prophet right so there wouldn't be no need of it my point is one thing it would be a disgrace for me to step down out of the pulpit to go past go and be president of the united states that's right i would not be fulfilling the bible that i'm trying my best to find and to walk therein you see then i can turn over here and say hey this is happening these things are happening we're seeing the earthquakes and we're seeing the the thing we're seeing the plagues we're seeing all of the things but are we seeing it in the order of understanding are we trying to keep it in or just not the prophet taught that the bride does not go through the tribulation but he thought there could be a pre-tribulation you don't hear that one used a pre-tribulation oh blessed god one of these days california's gonna slide under because it's going to be an earthquake which one you better not be here when that six seal earthquake takes place get out of here four to six seals six seal earthquakes gonna take california under but what about a pre-tribulation he said we'd be at the mercy of the elements and the different things but we're not going to be in the tribulation well that's tribulation that sounds like a tribulation to me no it's not because tribulation is a wrath of god just get that right in your mind what is tribulation wrath of god so you can see there can be a california earthquake i've tried to preach it 40 years ago they could be a california earthquake then they could be another california earthquake there could be two of them taking place and that last earthquake is going to be when the sixth seal opens we better not be here when that seal breaks in the natural it's already broken and spiritual for us to understand we better not be here when it does in the natural we better start listening all right but do you get what i'm talking about god wanted a body so he created a human element body and we call his name jesus because that's the only name that god ever had is jesus all right and see then he went through what he was supposed to go through to pay the price to do all the things to make the sacrifice etc and then he left this world where's his body just a few days later here he come back right into his bride and made her his body we are his offspring we are his children he's got a body to live in now that's what it doesn't bother me i'm i'm human i'm i'm i know and i exist with all of us being humans but it doesn't bother me about all this of the viruses and stuff like that i'm a human being it does and that human being side but yet i know that he's gonna take care of me well that's why i didn't jump up down when all of them were saying that you know that if you had the viruses then you wouldn't have god you wouldn't a part of the body of christ show that to them in the word you realize what they were saying they were saying that the lord jesus christ had a virus because he was sick you don't listen to what people say and then analyze what they say jesus christ was sick then are you going to say that because of him being sick he was not of god um brother branham was sick stomach viruses all kinds of things all kind of situations but did it mean he wasn't of god no it was more the fact that he was of god he said well you've had the virus brother dale yeah i know what that's what they say i don't know nothing about it i stayed five days in the hospital for them to run me through they come in there one day and said going home i don't know what it was doing i didn't see nobody i didn't get no weather reports i didn't have nobody telling me what was going on the kids had called pig get called we was doing the best we could do to communicate but i wasn't worried because i believe god is real and if i am a child of god then i am the body that god is inhabiting do you think that way you need to i got notes here if you want them how jesus was the body of god that in body he was a man in spirit he was god how many you want us to read we've read them over and over to you jesus was the body of god how many do you want to read only 31 or 32. jesus was the flesh of god a tabernacle that god dwelt in here on the earth can you see one god you realize without that person now of jesus christ the human element your godhead is not complete because you only got a father in a holy spirit and that's what we had right come on i admit where i come from because that was the way i saw it the brother mode asked me what i saw i told him i said i saw god in three persons father's son holy ghost he said you're just as much as trinity as anybody else i said explain that he's a person of personality personality is an individual individual's a person i said okay i don't believe that no more it didn't take a whole lot for me to figure that out i knew i was wrong because all we was dealing with back there was a spirit and a soul or something like that or our fathers and and spirit but to understand one god you've got to have father son in the holy ghost see so that means when he left he was coming back as the holy spirit all right are you listening on the day of pentecost the holy spirit came back the spirit of almighty god not a second person not another thought or idea but the spirit of almighty god was coming back to live in a people that would make them the children of god god would have a body but you see that's why jesus can't come brother brown said he said said he when he comes back said it'd be the millennium because you think about it what if he come back right now and mess up every scripture in the bible because he'd be here in the body but he's already got a body we're his body see if he come right now there'd be two bodies that won't work he said well don't you expect no i'm expecting him to meet him in the air come on let's begin with the prophet he said he doesn't come to earth and set his foot on earth at that time he said we meet him in the air he can't come down now to a body because we are the body listen back there you had father you had the holy spirit now i'm trying to make an illustration out of this so don't run it off from the wrong end cause you're gonna bypass my whole point for the foundational world he was father right he was the spirit but he didn't have a 16-element body but he had a body a theophany a glorified condition existence whatever but see that was not his plan are you listening if you didn't get the whole point just listen i'm trying now i've read the book over to so far now i'm trying to just put the little pieces into it because you see when he came back on the day of pentecost it was not a flesh body coming to live in you and i so what did it take to make him complete it took a time that he would have a human body did he dwell on earth in a flesh 16 elements that would make his plan complete read christ the mystery god revealed god had a plan and a purpose that he was going to achieve and that was to make himself manifest see so jesus was father son and holy ghost not a trinity not a twoness but a real truth one true and living god he then had a body that he could walk in so he fellowshipped with a group of people and stayed with him for his life 33 years but it still wasn't a finish because he knew that he was going to have to give up that life that was within him he knew that he was going to have to die right are you listening jesus knew he was going to die all right listen what i'm saying if he knew he was going to die what was he going to do because he was going to lose the body because the soul and the spirit and the being and all that of almighty god couldn't die right god can't die come on i'm with you because you're dividing them up but when he made that possible by living in that human element brother brown said it made the three a triunity not a trinity not three persons one person manifested in three manifestations one person manifested in many many forms don't you think it was probably getting pretty strong long about him last few days when he seen that even all that he had done seems to have been worth nothing because they were just running from him and he told peter he said peter you're going to deny me oh peter no i won't i'll be there i'll fight for you to the end he meant it physically it's for right there he'd a fault cause he done it he tried it quick as they come and tried to pick him up in the garden who happened what what did peter do grabbed a sword whacked off a guy's ear he was fighting because it hadn't dawned on him what was taking place but when jesus said give me that sword if you take the sword you'll die by the sword then peter began to realize this man is going to die but he didn't know the story of how what it was made to work that that would be the only way he could ever get salvation he had the anointing he had the anointing of the spirit he had the gifts he had the things right but he began to realize something's going to take place because this man is talking about dying and now i realize it's physical because why didn't he grab a sword and start slinging peter began to realize he also seen his master say leave it alone this is all the plan of god to be made manifest i've got to go to calvary i've got to give my life because that's the only way you can get eternal life peter but it's also the only way that i'll have a body because i'm gonna have to give up this one i'm gonna have to exit this body well that's literally all he done jesus never died you on a quote from the prophet jesus didn't die and he ain't talking about the father son or any i mean he's talking about jesus never died he gave up his life he exited the body himself he went out he didn't he died himself he gave his own life because he knew the story that that was the only way to bring to the finality of what he come to do and that he was going to have a body what if he had a little time that he'd been able to sit down with peter and the 12 and you know and all of them and and start explaining what was taking place but he couldn't do it all done finished he had tried to explain it throughout his life and in the ministry and thing but he couldn't do it but jesus was simply saying i'm doing this to bring forth the body i'm going away but i'm coming back well he was expecting him physically to come back right but he wasn't talking about physically coming back he was talking about coming back in spirit form to dwelling them to make them his offspring to give eternal life see a body you realize on the day of pentecost it provided him a body how many do you want on these notice now he is the head of the body that's born from the sin of unbelief which is he is the head of the church which is his body and he wants the preeminence listen now listen close while we're what he is to be the head of the body his bride's body which is taken from him flesh and blood like in adam how much were you on as the head was struck from the took from the grave so must the body follow him where the head goes truly the body's going the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom some of you have these you got all of them and the rest of them if you want them i'll be glad to run you some because i'll run a good mini for this afternoon because i want to get into something else so you see if we don't get this right about the body of christ and the doings and the salvation and the point then how in the world can you talk about a bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily brother branham said she was well i can't believe it well then okay if you can't believe it then you won't be a part of it oh you'll be a luther you'll be a wesley you'll be a pentecostal but they couldn't do it they couldn't come forth it's the end time bride that will come forth so he had a body in jesus christ but he wants a body to live in the stature of a perfect man right the stature of a perfect man is the body of christ he's the head somebody's going to walk those steps until they can come into the position and god's going to come and take us out of this what are we going to be willing to do and to fight what has to be done or what are we going to do are we going to be scared to death when things start happening and they start closing down on us and whatever they decide to do and i ain't talking about tribulation that's what i'm talking about to you we've got a pre-tribulation the bride don't go through the tribulation but she goes through a pre-tribulation brother branham says israel will be getting their message while the church is getting persecution i ain't going to try to explain what he's saying i'm just saying what he said he said they'll take he said they'll get there while they're getting their message triple h is going to sit in over here and work its way to israel then the great tribulation strikes israel see that's why you can't understand that seven and three and a half people can't follow what the prophet is saying but they can't follow it with one thing we're not he's told us over and over we're not to be in the tribulation but he told us over and over we'd be at the mercy of the elements but see they don't look at a pre-tribulation you see as the bride begins to realize who she is and what's taking place then the body of god is being formed on earth getting ready you think he's going to run off and leave us when he spent all of this time trying to get us to come to that place home musician where he can come to a place that they can that he can manifest himself in us i hope you're listening i've got the notes for whatever you want to read them of all the prophet told about how that jesus was the body of almighty god that don't make a trinitarian point that makes the one true and living god to be in reality that jesus was almighty god all god was he poured into christ but see then we fail to follow the other of all crisis poured into the church until we realize that things has taken place it ought to be setting our hearts on fire getting ready to get out of here i don't i don't want to stay in this whole world i don't know about you i mean man i'm 80 years old but that still ain't here i've enjoyed my life i've had a wonderful life that i could live for god but i want to get out of here i want to leave what about you let's stand together think on these things we'll get back to it this afternoon on the godhead the bride will wind up being the godhead bodily or there's not going to be a taking her out of here but i just don't believe we can do it well then or not go ahead brother sing that chorus uh all hell king jesus [Music] if you understand what i tried to say today he's not complete without you and me the rest of the story has got to be written we're in that we're in the white woman in the white house we're in the airplanes the jet's the thing i'm the flying saucers and all we're in there and i don't believe it

understand you what do you mean we are the body of will christ with you without us he has nobody remember the the prophet and the message lead not to your own understanding he said to bride that god is not complete without you oh get to that fullness of the godhead bodily you'll see why he couldn't do it most of them there was no way the word could be birthed right but we have had the message [Music] you have an aid i'm going to praise [Music] father we thank you we pray that what we said lord would be enough for the people to understand what we're trying to talk about talk about you and
