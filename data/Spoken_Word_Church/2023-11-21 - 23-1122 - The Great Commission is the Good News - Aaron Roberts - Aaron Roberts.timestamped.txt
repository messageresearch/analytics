[13:46] reasons I want to I want to look at this

[15:32] can't thank you enough can't praise you
[15:34] enough and Lord there many that'll be
[15:36] traveling and doing different things and
[15:38] Lord we just pray that your hand be upon
[15:41] them Lord bless each one Lord bless the
[15:43] Gatherings and Lord we just commit all
[15:46] things to you Lord there's many that
[15:49] have a need in their bodies lord they're
[15:52] seeking answers Lord but L we just
[15:54] commit them to you Lord and we know that
[15:56] you can touch them because we've seen
[15:59] you move and even even when it didn't
[16:03] look like there was no way and but
[16:05] you've come on the scene and and worked
[16:07] a
[16:09] miracle and if you can do it once you
[16:11] can do it again
[16:13] and but as the the man that
[16:16] came with the child that was sick Lord
[16:18] and he he come and said
[16:21] Lord help my unbelief Lord help our
[16:24] unbelief Lord that that we can believe
[16:27] because you said if thou can't believe
[16:30] all things are possible and Lord that is
[16:32] still real today so Lord just help us in
[16:37] our in our ways we commit everything to
[16:40] you in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[16:44] amen Matthew 28 beginning at 18 verse 18
[16:48] He says and Jesus came and spake unto
[16:50] them saying all power is is given unto
[16:55] me in heaven and in Earth he said go ye
[16:57] therefore and teach all Nations
[16:59] baptizing them in the name of the father
[17:00] and of the son of the Holy Ghost
[17:02] teaching them to observe all things
[17:04] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[17:07] Am With You Always even until the end of
[17:10] the world and then the other portion of
[17:12] the scripture is Mark 16 very familiar
[17:15] scripture and he says and he said unto
[17:19] them go ye into all the world and preach
[17:21] the gospel to Every Creature he that
[17:24] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[17:26] but he that believeth not shall be
[17:28] damned and these signs shall follow them
[17:31] that believe in my name shall they cast
[17:33] out Devils they shall speak with new
[17:35] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[17:38] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[17:41] not hurt them and they shall lay hands
[17:43] on the sick and they shall recover amen
[17:46] God bless you tonight you can have your
[17:48] seats
[17:51] and you know looking at at these passage
[17:54] of scripture here when Jesus is speaking
[17:58] to to them and and giving them brother
[18:00] BR said it was the commiss the Great
[18:03] Commission to go into all teach All
[18:06] Nations and he here he was speaking in
[18:09] Mark talking about preach the gospel to
[18:11] Every Creature but then he was talking
[18:13] about teach All Nations all these things
[18:16] and baptizing
[18:18] them and then he says and teaching them
[18:21] to observe all things whatsoever I have
[18:23] commanded you and you know the the word
[18:26] there observe you know many times when
[18:28] we look at the word observe we just
[18:30] think it means to to look at or to watch
[18:33] but you know the the word observe has
[18:34] many different meanings to it you know
[18:37] we're getting ready to observe
[18:41] Thanksgiving so you know we just don't
[18:43] look at it we participate amen I don't
[18:46] know about the rest of you do I do amen
[18:49] I don't know about the rest of you I
[18:51] participate so you know that so when you
[18:53] look at to when it says to observe it's
[18:55] not just to look at something or to
[18:59] maintain observation of you know to
[19:02] watch but it also means to stay in
[19:04] compliance with it also means to take
[19:07] part of so you're taking so when you
[19:10] observe something you're looking at what
[19:12] what the scripture says and you're
[19:14] getting into what what Jesus said
[19:17] because he said observe the things that
[19:19] I have said unto you and you know one of
[19:21] the things that when we look at things
[19:23] and we talk about observe well you know
[19:25] there's there's two sides to that
[19:27] because it's not just doing something
[19:31] but it's not doing something also
[19:33] because there when you when you observe
[19:35] then you have to know which way you're
[19:36] supposed to go you know just like the
[19:39] the word crime when you talk about crime
[19:41] and everybody thinks well that means
[19:43] committing something you know I don't I
[19:45] I you know to do something well don't
[19:47] pay your taxes and see if you if you
[19:50] don't end up in trouble you know because
[19:52] it why
[19:53] because the word crime actually means an
[19:56] act or omission that's against the law
[19:59] right so when we talk about observing
[20:01] something then we have to know just like
[20:03] the scripture says abstain from all
[20:05] appearance of evil so those things and
[20:07] when he said do these things where
[20:09] there's things that he told us not to do
[20:11] and those things we stay away from but
[20:13] there's things that he wants us to do
[20:15] and those things that we are supposed to
[20:17] do so when we observe the things that
[20:19] are in the scripture then we understand
[20:21] because he said you show them to
[20:24] demonstrate the scripture you just
[20:27] demonstrate these things because he said
[20:29] I'm telling you that because he said
[20:31] when you go to do these things he said
[20:33] demonstrate the gospel to the people not
[20:36] just preach it not just talk about it
[20:38] but it's actually a demonstration of the
[20:40] power of the Holy Ghost and you know
[20:42] when because you know one of the things
[20:44] here in in the scripture when when uh
[20:48] Jesus is speaking to the disciples and
[20:50] tell them you know he tells them to
[20:52] baptize in the name of the father and of
[20:55] the son and of the Holy Ghost but see it
[20:57] took a revelation because Peter when he
[21:00] got up on the day of Pentecost he didn't
[21:02] go back and tell them exactly what Jesus
[21:05] said because he knew what the revelation
[21:08] of the word was that Jesus had given him
[21:10] and when he stood up there and began to
[21:12] speak to him he said repent and be
[21:15] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[21:17] the remission of sin and you shall
[21:19] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[21:21] the Holy Ghost came but you observe
[21:24] these things that I have told you to do
[21:26] because he never said baptized in the in
[21:29] the title form of the father son but he
[21:32] told him that there was a name and he
[21:34] said he said there was only one name
[21:37] given under Heaven whereby men shall be
[21:39] saved and he said whatsoever you do in
[21:42] word or deed do all in the Name of
[21:44] Christ Jesus so there was one name that
[21:45] was given that has all of the Power has
[21:49] all of the glory everything that rest in
[21:52] in God was placed in one name and that
[21:53] was in placed in Jesus Christ and that
[21:55] was the name that was given to us and so
[21:57] when what do we take on then when we
[22:00] become a child of God we take on the
[22:02] name Jesus Christ then as the Bride of
[22:05] of Christ that we become mes Jesus
[22:08] Christ we are living in the power of the
[22:10] name Jesus Christ that's who we are
[22:13] today not who we're going to be or you
[22:15] know hoping for no that's who we
[22:18] are we have that's who we are that's
[22:21] that's what the good news has come and
[22:22] brought to us who we are
[22:26] amen amen
[22:28] so here this this is from the message my
[22:31] redeemer liveth and I I've got a few
[22:33] quotes I want to I want to read
[22:35] here and brother brother sister now this
[22:38] message that was read to us this morning
[22:41] we would call it the Great Commission it
[22:43] was the last commission our lord gave
[22:45] his disciples to go to all the world to
[22:47] preach the Glorious Good Tidings of the
[22:49] Resurrection to all the world for a
[22:51] witness and then he would return and
[22:53] that signs and wonders would accompany
[22:56] this message that was to be
[22:58] preached and then he goes on and he
[23:00] starts talking about Christian religion
[23:02] he starts talking about the Catholic
[23:03] church and all the things that just a
[23:05] skip time but you know he talks about
[23:07] all that and he says but he said it's
[23:08] always been my contention friends that
[23:11] those things mean
[23:12] nothing because you know when he starts
[23:14] talking about you know when when you try
[23:16] to hallow the ground and you try to put
[23:18] up relics and tokens and everything
[23:20] brother Ram said God never sent us
[23:22] relics and tokens he sent us the Holy
[23:24] Ghost and all the things that you know
[23:26] we try to people try to observe these
[23:28] things and you know they want to put up
[23:30] and have all these things well that
[23:31] actually means nothing there's no power
[23:34] there because you know many times when
[23:36] they when you go back to the Old
[23:38] Testament and you look at all the things
[23:39] that the the people in the Old Testament
[23:42] when they went back and you know they
[23:43] were just going through the motions and
[23:45] doing these things that that God had
[23:47] told the children of Israel to do well
[23:49] they just become a stink in God's
[23:51] nostrils because there was no faith
[23:53] there there was no believing in what was
[23:54] going on it was just something they went
[23:56] to church and done and went through the
[23:58] rituals and then they went home because
[24:00] they never believed in the power that
[24:03] would take place under the under what
[24:05] God was trying to do for
[24:07] them why because the people that stood
[24:10] in the pool pit and preached to them day
[24:12] after day week after week month after
[24:15] month they just went by because they did
[24:17] not believe what they
[24:19] said why because it was just a carnal
[24:22] commandment to them they just went
[24:24] through the motions why because standing
[24:26] behind the pull pit the people that
[24:27] actually preached it didn't believe it
[24:29] that's right brother amen and it's the
[24:31] same way today is that people that stand
[24:34] behind the pulpits don't even believe
[24:35] what they
[24:37] preach why why are people so tossed
[24:40] about why why why is denominations in
[24:43] the in the mess they are today why why
[24:45] do we see these kind of things why
[24:46] because people don't believe what the
[24:48] word
[24:50] says they don't read and so if they
[24:53] don't believe it then well you know I
[24:55] just I just take my own ideas my own
[24:58] thoughts well if you get to the point
[25:00] where you start taking your own thoughts
[25:02] well you're in real
[25:04] trouble because how can how can you try
[25:07] to understand the great infinite things
[25:09] of God with a finite mind amen that's
[25:12] right but he says it's always been my
[25:14] contention friends that those things
[25:16] mean nothing it isn't any man can die
[25:19] and lay in the ground but what Rose from
[25:21] that is what we worship today a living
[25:25] resurrected ascended Lord Jesus who
[25:27] lived today he said many people can die
[25:30] but it takes what rose from the dead and
[25:33] when he rose from the dead because he
[25:36] was the only one that could lay down his
[25:38] life because he told him ahead of time
[25:41] he said he said tear down this Temple
[25:43] but said in three days I'll raise again
[25:45] because he knew what he was what he was
[25:48] called to do what the word had told him
[25:50] to do when he walked out there he knew
[25:52] what was going to take place but he knew
[25:54] because the word had said so that when
[25:57] he went went down corruption would never
[25:59] touch that body and he would resurrect
[26:01] in power and and so you and I are the
[26:04] same way today if if we have went
[26:07] through the same process that he went
[26:09] because when we die out to ourselves
[26:11] when we raise we raise in newness of
[26:14] life in the power of Jesus Christ but
[26:17] the problem is is people don't see that
[26:19] people don't believe that but let me
[26:21] tell you some brothers and sisters
[26:22] that's more real than the seat you're
[26:24] sitting home that's more real than the
[26:26] air you breathe
[26:28] amen
[26:30] amen
[26:32] see Jesus this is from the M the Easter
[26:35] cell he says he said Jesus said go ye
[26:37] into all the world and preach the gospel
[26:39] to Every Creature how far all the world
[26:42] who to Every Creature he said they've
[26:45] never received it yet and these signs
[26:47] shall follow them that believe how long
[26:49] all the world who to Every Creature
[26:53] these signs shall follow them in all the
[26:55] world and in every creature and then he
[26:59] continues on dropping down just skip
[27:03] that to the next one where he says Paul
[27:05] is ordaining
[27:07] these 30 years later in Galatians 1: 18
[27:12] y if an angel from heaven preaches to
[27:16] you any other gospel than this which is
[27:19] already received see already been
[27:22] preached let him be accursed he said I
[27:25] believe that Pentecost began without
[27:27] ending I believe it's to be every
[27:30] creature all times at all places that
[27:33] Pentecost should always remain the
[27:36] Pentecostal blessings should be upon the
[27:39] people then he says now what is this
[27:42] Pentecostal blessing he said it's the
[27:44] confirmation of the Resurrection he says
[27:47] no wonder the gospel itself means good
[27:50] news good news of what he has raised
[27:53] from the dead and because I live ye
[27:56] shall live also so we ye shall which ye
[28:00] which were once dead and sin trespasses
[28:03] God has quickened Us Together by that
[28:05] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[28:08] dead and we are now sitting in Heavenly
[28:10] places with him communing with him
[28:12] talking with him what a joy to tell the
[28:14] people that story that believes it to be
[28:18] the truth and he says I'm wondering
[28:21] today justess got a little bit more he
[28:24] said but I'm wondering today it's what's
[28:26] happening are we really getting the
[28:28] people to God are we just getting them
[28:31] to church we must get them to Christ
[28:34] where this quickening power he said it's
[28:37] good to go to church but he said that's
[28:38] not far enough but to go on to Christ
[28:42] from the church because we must receive
[28:44] this quickening
[28:46] power if we ever expect to be in that
[28:49] General Resurrection because it's the
[28:51] only thing that will ever bring us from
[28:53] the dead for if the spirit that raised
[28:56] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[28:58] it'll also Quicken make bring you to
[29:01] life your mortal bodies what a promise
[29:04] to tell amen what a promise to us he
[29:07] said the very essence of this
[29:09] Resurrection is to tell and to show and
[29:11] to prove that Jesus has raised up from
[29:14] the dead he's not dead he's a living
[29:17] he's he's he lives here he's in US it'll
[29:22] be with you even in you a little while
[29:25] and the world seeth me no more
[29:27] yet ye shall see me for I will be with
[29:30] you even in you until the end of the
[29:32] world now as Christians we all claim he
[29:35] is alive or we have been quickened from
[29:38] quickened from life from Death To Life
[29:41] by his spirit and if we haven't been
[29:43] quickened then we've not been made alive
[29:47] that's right so that's what so God has
[29:50] come and he has he has quickened the
[29:52] word he's made us alive so when he said
[29:55] when he said this thing what is what is
[29:57] us to do is to Proclaim that he is alive
[29:59] he's risen from the dead because the
[30:01] things that he done that we shall do
[30:04] also to Proclaim exactly what he done
[30:07] it's and we're here today to do the
[30:08] exact same thing amen that's right
[30:12] because we are we are the body of Christ
[30:15] if we're the body of Christ then the
[30:16] things that the head done then the body
[30:18] will do also that's right and he said
[30:22] greater you do the same works but he
[30:24] said you do the but greater than these
[30:27] shall you do more than this shall you
[30:33] do but many
[30:35] times the devil wants to wants to Cloud
[30:38] our minds he wants to Cloud our vision
[30:40] and not well I don't know you know I
[30:41] don't know if that's for me if that's
[30:43] for somebody else you know it's it's
[30:45] okay if brother Bob does that but you
[30:47] know the thing is it's but you lay hands
[30:49] on the sick right you cast out Devils
[30:53] you know well we're just going we'll
[30:54] just wait till Sunday and we'll we'll
[30:56] call brother way no you cast out Devils
[31:00] because you know what you because if if
[31:02] the devil is bothering you then you know
[31:04] what we can come and lay hands on you we
[31:06] can anoint you with allil but you know
[31:08] what unless you speak the word the devil
[31:11] is not going to leave you're the one
[31:13] that's got to speak to him and tell him
[31:15] he's got no hold on you because you're
[31:17] God's Property and you're laying a claim
[31:19] on the word of God for him to leave and
[31:22] if you don't do that don't expect
[31:23] nothing to take
[31:26] place
[31:28] it takes you you've got to speak the
[31:30] word right if you say to this mountain
[31:34] be moved and don't
[31:37] doubt he didn't say he didn't say for
[31:39] anybody else he said you do it amen even
[31:43] though even the weakest
[31:44] Christian yeah if you're in the body of
[31:47] Christ then you have you have that
[31:49] position because you have that that
[31:52] Authority you have that claim on the
[31:55] word to do that amen
[31:58] then it doesn't matter how weak how
[32:00] because what he say the weakest
[32:02] Christian when the weakest Christian
[32:03] gets down on their knees he said the
[32:05] Gates of Hell Shake why because the
[32:07] whole Foundation is shaking because you
[32:10] begin to pray and seek
[32:13] God and we like well you know that's
[32:15] that's good but sometimes we don't
[32:16] actually just sit down and meditate on
[32:18] that and realize that you know what you
[32:20] are more than a match through through
[32:23] Jesus Christ who's given you the power
[32:25] you're more than a match for the dev
[32:27] by ourselves we're not but through him
[32:30] through him has loved us and has
[32:32] equipped us that we're more than a
[32:36] match but you know we don't have to we
[32:39] don't have to pray and and worry and
[32:42] fret take God at his word amen believe
[32:47] what he said believe what he said about
[32:51] you but if we can just put our our faith
[32:54] in what he said amen that's right
[33:00] this is from the the message the faith
[33:03] that was once delivered to the
[33:10] Saints and let's see
[33:15] here he was talking about the woman at
[33:17] the
[33:18] whale and he says many times here when
[33:21] he was on Earth and before going away he
[33:23] said these things that I do shall ye do
[33:26] also you do also even more than this
[33:29] shall ye do for I go to my father go ye
[33:32] into all the world the last commission
[33:33] the Great Commission to every Minister
[33:36] go into all the world and preach the
[33:37] gospel what is the gospel you say it's
[33:39] the word not only excuse me Paul said
[33:42] the gospel came not through the word
[33:44] only but through the power and the
[33:46] manifestation of the word by the Holy
[33:49] Ghost AM to teach the words like reading
[33:51] a
[33:52] newspaper but he says but we want to see
[33:55] someone Anointed with the the Holy
[33:59] Spirit here brother R was speaking and
[34:01] and here we was talking about the um the
[34:04] Methodist Bishop there in India and you
[34:06] know because brother Brown said one time
[34:08] they told him said listen we can quote
[34:10] and understand the the just the letter
[34:13] of the word he said we understand
[34:15] because this is a um an Eastern book and
[34:18] he said we understand this better than
[34:20] you do he said he said when it comes to
[34:23] understanding what's written in the on
[34:24] the page we can understand that we read
[34:27] that we know all that we we can give
[34:29] great great dissertations on that but he
[34:31] said he said but what we want to see
[34:33] because they had been so wrapped up and
[34:36] seen just just the mundane and all these
[34:39] things but what they were Desiring was
[34:41] to see it come alive and he said he said
[34:43] that's the reason he said we want to see
[34:45] someone when he's telling brother R we
[34:46] want to see somebody Anointed with the
[34:48] Holy Ghost that can make it live again
[34:51] why because they read in the scripture
[34:53] what took place back then well if he's
[34:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[34:57] then we're Desiring somebody to show us
[34:59] that he's still alive today not just not
[35:02] just some historical God where we read
[35:04] about what took place years ago but no
[35:06] we want to see what him to live today he
[35:08] said that's it he said we want somebody
[35:10] who can produce what the Bible says it
[35:12] will do see otherwise we want to see the
[35:16] faith that was once delivered to the
[35:18] Saints there you are amen he wants so we
[35:23] that's what God has called us to do is
[35:25] to demonstrate the gospel because the
[35:27] world is looking for somebody to make
[35:30] these things alive to make these things
[35:31] real to make these things known not just
[35:35] not just talk about it why because
[35:36] there's many people that that have heard
[35:39] the word and and they but but you know
[35:41] they get so wrapped up on things and you
[35:44] know they they don't even believe what
[35:46] what they've read but you know what it
[35:48] takes it takes a a a move of the Holy
[35:52] Ghost to show these things and make them
[35:53] come
[35:55] alive
[35:58] you know it's so it's so amazing because
[36:01] you
[36:02] know when when it becomes alive to you
[36:05] by the Holy Ghost when the when it
[36:07] becomes Quicken to you you know you
[36:09] don't have to have an answer why because
[36:13] that is the answer because when it
[36:15] becomes real to you it doesn't matter
[36:17] what anybody else comes and tries to
[36:20] take you away from that and tries to
[36:22] bring every kind of evidence contrary to
[36:25] the word if the word is been Quicken to
[36:27] you if it becomes real because it
[36:28] becomes a part of you then you know what
[36:30] you won't you won't walk away from that
[36:32] because there's nothing going to sway
[36:33] you away from
[36:35] that because you don't need you don't
[36:37] need an answer why because he is the
[36:40] answer because when it becomes real to
[36:42] you that's what that will hold you amen
[36:45] that's right right you know I was
[36:49] listening to brother Matt Watkins the
[36:52] other day and he was he was preaching
[36:55] and and he was was talking about
[36:58] uh there was there was these men that
[37:01] were Bible scholars and and they had the
[37:05] one man said he said I've always had
[37:06] problems trying to read the scripture
[37:08] where it talked about uh Sodom and
[37:12] Gomorrah you know trying to understand
[37:14] that and and you know when when you
[37:16] begin to look at those things you
[37:18] know when when you see the the life that
[37:21] lot lived and you know here here lot was
[37:24] looking at God speaking to Abraham
[37:26] leading Abraham in in the way that he
[37:28] should go and you know then lot was
[37:31] standing right there right behind him
[37:33] watching to see all these things and yet
[37:35] he gets so wrapped up because because
[37:38] here is here's a man that's trying to
[37:41] follow God and you know he's trying to
[37:43] stay away from the things of the world
[37:45] because God's not leading him that way
[37:47] but you know what lot just got just
[37:49] close enough to Ju Just to be a carnal
[37:52] believer but he couldn't see what God
[37:54] was doing because God was trying to lead
[37:56] him and you know he just got close
[37:59] enough he just got religious enough but
[38:01] the problem was the pull of Sodom was
[38:03] too much for him because he could see
[38:06] how wonderful things looked at Sodom and
[38:08] he all of a sudden he went down to Sodom
[38:11] because you know he was because the pull
[38:13] of Sodom was too great for him but you
[38:15] know what the people of God the children
[38:17] of God Abraham when he was being led J
[38:20] you're what God brought him away from
[38:22] those things even when he failed even
[38:25] when he walked the wrong way then you
[38:27] know what God was there to put him back
[38:28] on the right track to lead him the right
[38:31] way but here's here's lot going into
[38:34] Sodom because not only does he look
[38:36] towards Sodom but the next thing you
[38:38] know because he saw the well-watered
[38:39] plains but the next thing you know he's
[38:41] wrapped up in the middle of
[38:44] it and brother Matthew was talking about
[38:46] you know you know they can't
[38:48] see you know when when they when they
[38:51] looked they were trying
[38:52] to the
[38:54] archaeologists have tried to find
[38:57] where I don't know if any of y'all have
[38:59] heard this but you know the
[39:01] archaeologists were trying to find
[39:02] exactly where Sodom and Gomorrah
[39:04] were and um people have they've tried to
[39:08] do the digs and all that tried to find
[39:10] where they're at and uh you know these
[39:13] men that were Bible scholars you know
[39:15] here they are and it's like well you
[39:16] know I just have a hard time believing
[39:18] what took place in Sodom you know and
[39:21] all these things and it's like well you
[39:22] know that was you know was that just a
[39:24] fairy tale that was just something that
[39:25] was written in the scripture or was it
[39:26] really real well all of a sudden the
[39:30] these men they got in touch with these
[39:32] archaeologists that were doing these
[39:34] these digs and they were finding these
[39:35] things and this man actually had read
[39:37] the scripture and I guess he was um a
[39:40] Christian and he was archaeologist but
[39:42] he began to dig and you know everybody
[39:44] else had their own ideas where where it
[39:46] was but he began to read the scripture
[39:48] and began to look and said no I think
[39:51] Sodom and Gomorrah is in a different
[39:52] location than everybody else thinks and
[39:55] so he started to dig where he thought
[39:57] that it might be well when he started to
[39:59] dig down they started finding all of the
[40:02] the artifacts in the ground and as they
[40:04] were digging them up he come across
[40:07] pottery that was in the ground and he
[40:09] looked at it and he said we've got a
[40:12] problem he said we got Pottery in the
[40:14] ground that's glazed and he's like this
[40:17] kind of glazing didn't come to the like
[40:18] the Ottoman Empire it's many years in
[40:21] the future we so it's like this can't be
[40:23] it so they they were looking they began
[40:25] to dig they see more things but he said
[40:27] they took this Pottery they sent it off
[40:29] to a lab and had them look it up and he
[40:31] said analyze this and tell me what you
[40:33] find so they looked at it and they said
[40:35] well it's called Uh the glazing on there
[40:37] is not like an average glazing what you
[40:39] would think but he's called it they I
[40:40] believe they called it trinitite
[40:42] trinitite is a heavy is a great heat
[40:46] that's been applied to this this pottery
[40:49] that he said trinitite is actually when
[40:52] sand turns to glass in a nuclear
[40:55] explosion
[40:57] and he said that's what was on those
[40:59] pots and he said they to dig and find
[41:02] human remains and he said they found
[41:04] them from the waist from the waist down
[41:07] and he said the waist up he said a lot
[41:08] of them were just completely
[41:10] disintegrated and they and all of the
[41:12] things they began to look at all the
[41:13] different things that they saw in this
[41:15] dig well when they began to talk about
[41:17] it the U archaeologists didn't want to
[41:20] explain it outright they just said well
[41:24] uh Sodom and Gomorrah was was destroyed
[41:26] by a heat
[41:27] event but they didn't want to explain
[41:30] what they meant by that and so they went
[41:32] on so they started when they when they
[41:34] had finished their course and had turned
[41:36] the cameras off they come in and they
[41:38] began to explain what took place they
[41:40] said it would had to have been a nuclear
[41:43] explosion for that kind of Destruction
[41:45] to take
[41:46] place and then when when they began to
[41:48] see that then all of a sudden here these
[41:51] men that had spent their
[41:53] lifetime one had spent his lifetime
[41:55] trying trying to understand these things
[41:58] by digging and this other man had
[42:00] actually spent his lifetime in a class
[42:04] reading the Bible had went to church all
[42:07] of his
[42:08] life had spent years all of his life
[42:11] trying to trying to read the scripture
[42:14] trying to gain understanding and and
[42:16] couldn't grasp that it just takes simple
[42:18] childlike Faith because God said he
[42:20] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah he
[42:22] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah but you
[42:24] know all of a sudden then it's like
[42:25] we're going that changed my whole
[42:27] attitude that changed my whole way of
[42:29] life that came my whole thought because
[42:30] all of a sudden somebody brought me
[42:32] proof that God destroyed Sodom and
[42:35] gomorra am because what took place was
[42:38] not just not just some kind of natural
[42:41] occurrence but there was something that
[42:43] Supernatural had to take place there
[42:45] because when you see the damage the
[42:46] destruction that took place there then
[42:48] all of a sudden they're said well you
[42:49] know I believe that well you know how
[42:52] terrible it is that somebody's got to
[42:54] have got to have proof that it that that
[42:57] something took place when when it just
[42:59] takes childlike Faith whe whether I see
[43:01] it or not you know I believe it because
[43:03] God said
[43:04] so I don't have to I don't have to hold
[43:07] Pottery I don't have to go to the Holy
[43:09] Land although it would be great I don't
[43:11] have to walk the shores of Galilee why
[43:13] because I was in him when he walked the
[43:15] shores of Galilee but you know what he's
[43:17] here today and he's the same as he was
[43:20] back then he's the same yesterday today
[43:22] and forever I don't need the whole
[43:25] Pottery of relics anything like that all
[43:27] I need is the same life that was in him
[43:29] inside of
[43:32] me brother yeah when nobody nobody
[43:37] believed
[43:38] him when he walked when he walked out
[43:40] there nobody understood him they didn't
[43:44] understand those
[43:45] things but you know what as
[43:50] as Peter said when they were standing
[43:53] there and asking him those things about
[43:55] the scripture and he want are you want
[43:57] to go also and he said Lord to whom
[43:58] shall we go amen thou alone has the
[44:02] words of eternal life
[44:06] amen thou he didn't understand
[44:15] it so this is from we would see Jesus
[44:18] brother says he said he said what we
[44:22] lack today if if when Christ gave them
[44:26] commission to go to all the world not to
[44:28] make churches or to build buildings or
[44:29] to make schools which are all right but
[44:31] he said preach the gospel and the gospel
[44:33] is not building buildings or sending
[44:35] people to school but it's the power and
[44:38] demonstration of the Holy Ghost then he
[44:41] said these signs shall follow them that
[44:43] believe amen he said but the Bible Still
[44:46] Remains that Jesus Christ is the same
[44:48] yesterday day and forever am then if he
[44:50] is the same he has to be the same in
[44:52] principle and power he has to be the
[44:56] same as he was only one difference a
[44:58] Corporal body but before he left the
[45:00] Earth he said I am the vine ye are the
[45:03] branches now the vine does not bear
[45:05] fruit the branch bears fruit not the
[45:08] vine so he left in charge of his church
[45:12] this Great Commission to Bear the same
[45:14] fruit that he bore when he was on the
[45:17] earth that's right so we are given that
[45:20] commission but if we also given the
[45:22] commission then we're also given the
[45:25] power then we all they're also equipped
[45:28] to do the same thing amen then we have
[45:30] that then we have what we need to do
[45:33] those things then all you have to do is
[45:35] draw from that because if you if you
[45:39] have received it then it is just as as
[45:42] real to
[45:43] you and to me as it was to him that's
[45:48] right because if if we are if we are
[45:51] Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ
[45:53] then the same thing that he had we have
[45:55] amen then it's the same that he to
[46:00] him
[46:04] see and said continue on
[46:08] here he said when he was speaking to the
[46:10] to the
[46:12] Greek when he said so we would see
[46:16] Jesus he's not so much as we would hear
[46:19] him but we would would just love to see
[46:21] him I just wonder if that wouldn't be
[46:23] the same feeling not to every person
[46:25] here to see Jes Jesus then how could we
[46:27] see him in his church in his people he
[46:29] said we are written Epistles the spirit
[46:31] of Christ lives in his people and
[46:34] produces his life and his ministry
[46:36] continues to go until he comes again and
[46:39] here he is it's the blindness of our
[46:41] eyes the reason we don't see him if we
[46:43] could just open our eyes to things that
[46:46] are real if we can just open our eyes to
[46:49] the things that are around us and
[46:51] brother B continues on here and he tells
[46:53] the story about the about the little boy
[46:55] want to know he said Can can anybody see
[46:57] God can anybody find God and you know
[46:59] everybody's like well you go ask the
[47:01] preacher and different ones but you know
[47:02] the preacher well you know you can't
[47:04] really see God but you know he got so
[47:06] discouraged but you know he found an old
[47:08] man that old fisherman down by the by
[47:10] the river and you know he asked him he
[47:13] said Can anyone see God after all the
[47:16] things that he had looked for in his
[47:18] life because you know he sat on a church
[47:19] pew and he heard so much in his life but
[47:22] you know he desired to see God he be he
[47:24] desire a little boy desire to see the
[47:26] Living God a living demonstration of God
[47:30] and then when when he was there and he
[47:32] was out there in the boat with that old
[47:34] fisherman and he began to weep and he
[47:36] told you he hugged that little boy and
[47:37] said God bless your heart he said he
[47:39] said that's all I've seen for the last
[47:41] 40 years and everything that I see is I
[47:43] see him everything in my life is him
[47:46] everything that I look at I can see him
[47:48] and
[47:49] everything yes can you see God yes he's
[47:52] in all he's in every aspect of your life
[47:54] if you'll just look for him you'll see
[47:56] him he's there but many times as he said
[48:00] we were so blind to the things that are
[48:01] around us we miss the things of God we
[48:04] miss the things that God has trying to
[48:06] reach out to us
[48:10] amen see here this is continuing on just
[48:14] scroll them and brother here brother
[48:17] still here in in the message we would
[48:18] see Jesus and you know he he's speaking
[48:21] of of the of the little the the lady
[48:23] that brings her her son into the
[48:26] Five and Dime Store and you know she's
[48:28] rattling everything in front of him
[48:29] trying to get his attention and you know
[48:31] what he's just stoned death and stoned
[48:33] blind you know he's just so fixated
[48:35] because he's said you know she said well
[48:37] the doctor says he's better but he's not
[48:40] and he doesn't change he's in the same
[48:41] kind of condition that he was before and
[48:44] he said see and I just wonder in this
[48:46] day that we live now if God isn't taking
[48:49] his child from place to place and
[48:51] manifesting different gifts and so forth
[48:53] before them that they still set num
[48:55] brained wow just so dead in s and
[48:59] trespasses until they can't see the
[49:01] glory and the gift of the Lord that he's
[49:03] trying to present before
[49:06] them may that be far from this great
[49:09] church tonight that's gathered here as
[49:11] God reveals himself may we be Earnest
[49:14] and sincere to see that it is Christ
[49:16] trying to make himself known to this
[49:19] church for the Salvation of souls for
[49:22] the healing of bodies and for every
[49:24] Redemptive bless
[49:26] that he died for all belongs to his
[49:28] church and to every believer so you know
[49:31] many times in our lives because that's
[49:33] what the devil wants us to do but
[49:35] sometimes we God brings things in front
[49:37] of us and he tries to get our attention
[49:39] to tell us who we are but sometimes
[49:41] we're just like that we get so numb
[49:43] bring to the things why because the
[49:45] devil is right there in front of you
[49:48] he's hounding you he's right there to
[49:50] hinder you and then God's trying to
[49:52] reach out and show you who you
[49:54] are
[49:56] and when and so when when these things
[49:59] happen see we're so Bound by these
[50:01] things amen and God's trying to tell us
[50:04] listen there's a greater there's a
[50:05] greater thing than what you have
[50:08] today just go on a little
[50:13] further let's not
[50:19] stop Lord help us not be
[50:23] numing see if we just get Bound by these
[50:26] things because that's what the devil
[50:27] wants us to
[50:29] do get so wrapped up in
[50:32] things that we don't see God in it
[50:37] amen this is from the message here ye
[50:40] himm he says I want to approach this
[50:42] tonight from a different
[50:44] standpoint and now Jesus meets with men
[50:46] in great Circles of many one time with
[50:49] 500 Brethren once with 70 with 12 with
[50:51] three with even with one he said that's
[50:54] what makes him so Divine that what makes
[50:58] him the infinite God to me is because he
[51:01] does things in such a simple way that
[51:03] our little finite mind cannot comprehend
[51:07] it he said his ways are Beyond ours
[51:10] they're past our understanding and to
[51:12] think that he would come down from
[51:14] heaven to visit one poor Lost Sinner is
[51:18] more than I can understand how did he
[51:21] ever come down to take on the form of
[51:23] sinful flesh to die to save Sinners why
[51:26] was he so interested in our healing that
[51:29] he was that he was striped and wounded
[51:32] by the Roman lash and through his
[51:34] stripes and suffering that we who suffer
[51:37] might be delivered it's more than the
[51:40] little finite mind can
[51:44] catch he said and to think that he would
[51:47] bring himself down he would walk to an
[51:49] individual would save an individual that
[51:52] would heal his enemy who was against him
[51:55] who had done everything against him and
[51:58] blasphemed his name and yet he was
[52:00] willing to come down and make this
[52:02] atonement and make that so that we could
[52:04] receive it then there's there's one
[52:07] thing that start then there's one thing
[52:09] that startled my thinking is how could a
[52:12] mortal being ever turn down and reject
[52:15] such Divine love when you know that your
[52:18] eternity bound when you've got to spend
[52:21] that time somewhere when all
[52:23] preparations has been made for your good
[52:26] pleasure and your eternal life and then
[52:28] to cast it aside for just a little
[52:30] pleasure of this Mortal life then you
[52:33] would complain about Esau selling his
[52:35] Birthright he said we are Way Beyond
[52:38] Esau in the way we sell our heritage for
[52:40] less than what Esau
[52:43] got and how when when you begin to take
[52:46] in the the account of what God done for
[52:49] us when he came when he left everything
[52:51] behind when the Splendor of heaven and
[52:53] all that when he left all of that behind
[52:55] to come down to take on our our position
[52:59] our F this not sin because he was not
[53:01] sinful but he took on the the likeness
[53:03] of sinful flesh just like we were in and
[53:06] he came down to to live this journey but
[53:09] he but he lived this journey to show us
[53:11] that we can overcome because he overcame
[53:14] it and when he came down that he took
[53:16] those stripes on his back so that we
[53:19] that would he would have our healing
[53:21] because it was already paid for before
[53:23] you ever got sick before you ever born
[53:25] or ever come into the world your feeling
[53:27] was already because before because he
[53:30] was stood as a lamb slain before the
[53:32] foundation of the world so before any of
[53:34] this was taking place the way was
[53:36] already made the price was already paid
[53:39] but you know when he came down and to
[53:40] finish these things to show us what he
[53:43] had done then how can somebody when you
[53:46] begin to to see what God has done for
[53:48] you to turn him down how can how can you
[53:51] just become so numb to
[53:54] this
[53:56] it's so it's so hard amen but praise God
[54:00] you know that's what God wants us to do
[54:03] by the preaching right Amen to catch our
[54:06] attention listen wake up realize who you
[54:09] are that's right amen take these
[54:13] things see when you when you see what
[54:15] God has done for you then when this is
[54:17] what God is trying to give you then this
[54:19] then it's and it's before you then you
[54:21] you don't have to ask because it's
[54:25] already given to you it's already
[54:28] yours see when you when you see these
[54:30] things when you when you see what God
[54:33] has given you that it belongs to you yes
[54:36] brother R said he said he said you know
[54:38] God don't want want a favor from you he
[54:41] because he said he is trying to give you
[54:43] eternal life when he's trying to do
[54:44] these things for you then it's already
[54:46] for
[54:48] you and said but see then that's what we
[54:51] have to do we have to understand that
[54:52] that's what God has given to us
[54:56] and he says he says no matter how low
[54:58] you are he said how little you are how
[55:00] Immortal you are how indecent you are
[55:03] how far out of society you've been
[55:05] ousted yet the son of the Living God
[55:08] loves you
[55:09] am and knocks at your door day after day
[55:14] and night and you just turn him down
[55:16] that's terrible he doesn't even sound
[55:18] sane to do such a thing to turn down the
[55:21] Son of God who's coming not to take
[55:23] something from from you but to save you
[55:26] from destruction when then is turned
[55:29] down he said what a pitiful sight it
[55:32] doesn't seem mental mentally right to
[55:35] turn him down right it isn't mentally
[55:37] right to turn him down it's a loss of
[55:39] mind to turn down the Son of God when he
[55:42] knocks at your heart's door yet he's
[55:44] turned down and will return back amen
[55:48] yeah why because he comes so many times
[55:50] and knocks at the
[55:52] door and keeps bringing the same thing
[55:55] and and showing you hey there's a way
[55:57] out we've got the remedy we've got
[55:59] everything that you have need of and you
[56:01] we go right back and we'll we'll stay in
[56:03] the same
[56:04] condition and miss out what God has done
[56:08] yep right when God is trying to speak to
[56:11] him and speak to him but you know just
[56:14] like just like the the disciples there
[56:16] you know when the disciples heard the
[56:18] word you know there was so many just
[56:20] like those 70 and you know all the
[56:22] different ones the multitudes heard
[56:24] Jesus when when when he was feeding them
[56:26] the the fish and the Loaves and all
[56:28] those things you know he had a whole
[56:30] crowd people he couldn't get rid of them
[56:31] you know they was they just hung to him
[56:34] but when he began to bring the word when
[56:36] he began to show them hey this is where
[56:38] you are and this is where you ought to
[56:39] be when he began to identify who he was
[56:42] and show them the way that because the
[56:45] scripture
[56:46] says he said he came to his own and his
[56:49] own received him not that's right but
[56:51] you know when he came to them when he
[56:53] began to make it known to them to show
[56:55] them who they were then all of a sudden
[56:57] who in the world can handle these things
[56:59] right when he be when he began to tell
[57:01] them he said unless you eat the Flesh of
[57:04] the son of man and drink his blood you
[57:05] have no life but he was trying to show
[57:08] them there is the way that because a w
[57:10] was promised in the Old Testament he was
[57:12] the Fulfillment of it that you can have
[57:14] the same
[57:16] life but they missed that and here he is
[57:19] when when the disciples were standing
[57:21] there you know they didn't understand
[57:22] what he was talking about but there was
[57:24] something that was ringing true to them
[57:26] that they couldn't get away from there
[57:27] was something that they were hanging on
[57:29] to and Jesus asked them said so will you
[57:32] all leave also he said Lord to whom
[57:34] shall we go he said you have the words
[57:36] of eternal life there was something that
[57:39] rang true to them they didn't understand
[57:40] it they didn't have to understand it
[57:43] amen but he understood them one thing if
[57:46] they could just believe it
[57:51] amen why because they had read in the
[57:53] scripture Peter and growing up
[57:56] understanding what the scriptures
[57:59] said and it wasn't going to be the same
[58:01] way that you know that the the priest
[58:04] said it was going to
[58:05] be the rabbis the Sadducees how they
[58:08] thought you know he's coming this way
[58:10] and you know he's going to come speak to
[58:12] us and he's going to have great robes
[58:13] and and great
[58:16] words he spoke like he spoke like
[58:18] everybody else and had a you know Jesus
[58:20] had a bad name nobody wanted to spend
[58:23] any time with him
[58:26] they thought he was devil
[58:28] possessed all the things and yet he was
[58:30] the Fulfillment of the word
[58:35] amen they couldn't they couldn't believe
[58:39] that but see they had to understand what
[58:42] God was trying to do for them
[58:47] yes and it's a same way with you and
[58:51] I see we just put our faith in him
[58:57] hanging on to these things that that he
[59:00] said just hang on to those things that
[59:02] you've heard that's right when he began
[59:05] and he said how can how can you expect
[59:07] God he said how can you expect God to do
[59:09] anything for you he said when you turn
[59:12] down the very Prince of Life when you've
[59:14] heard these things and you see them just
[59:16] like them when they when they saw those
[59:17] things and they heard Jesus speaking and
[59:19] tell them what was what was in the
[59:22] scripture and he began to tell them that
[59:24] I'm identified in the scripture I'm
[59:26] identifying you in the
[59:29] scripture because when they when they
[59:31] began to walk away when they began to
[59:33] doubt what he said did he not take them
[59:34] back to the Old Testament and tell them
[59:36] your father's done the same thing and
[59:38] you'll do the same thing when he told
[59:41] this when he told the Pharisees he said
[59:43] you're of your father the devil and you
[59:44] do the same thing you're going to turn
[59:45] you you killed all the prophets and you
[59:47] buried them up there and you polish
[59:49] their tombs but you'll still turn the
[59:50] word down because they done
[59:53] it true
[59:56] he said the same thing see they trying
[59:57] to hang on to their old traditions and
[1:00:00] and all those things that that that they
[1:00:01] had always held on to but see they were
[1:00:03] trying to show them a new way something
[1:00:05] that something that was real something
[1:00:07] that not just some tradition why because
[1:00:09] it just became old and and rotten and
[1:00:12] stinking you know brother BR was talking
[1:00:14] about you know just just like you know
[1:00:15] you hang on to these old things that
[1:00:17] just just like a a a old egg that's in a
[1:00:22] in a nest and brother R was talking
[1:00:24] about he said you know you see these
[1:00:25] birds and he said he said if if if the
[1:00:28] the
[1:00:29] uh the you know the hen or whatever the
[1:00:32] if the woman Bird female bird had not
[1:00:34] been with the male said you know she can
[1:00:36] sit on all the eggs and she can just be
[1:00:38] so faithful to sitting on those eggs and
[1:00:41] she can stay there till she gets so poor
[1:00:42] she can't get up off the eggs but you
[1:00:44] know the problem is is he said if she's
[1:00:46] not been with the male if she's if those
[1:00:48] are not fertilized eggs she can lay
[1:00:50] there and she can die and you know what
[1:00:52] those eggs will run away right amen
[1:00:55] there is nothing that's going to come
[1:00:56] out of that so until you come to the
[1:00:58] right place and get get it
[1:01:01] fertilized until it becomes real until
[1:01:04] you become receive the word and it
[1:01:06] becomes quick until you then it won't do
[1:01:07] you any good and know brother R says you
[1:01:10] know he said just like talking about
[1:01:12] Divine Healing and all those things he
[1:01:14] said if you got to those things and
[1:01:16] don't see that he said it's just like
[1:01:17] those old rot eggs and he said you need
[1:01:19] to kick them out of the nest you need to
[1:01:21] clean it all up fumigate it sanitize it
[1:01:24] get rid of all of it and start over
[1:01:26] until you get rid of all that why
[1:01:28] because if you've got your own idea and
[1:01:30] it's not bringing forth anything then
[1:01:32] it's time to be get rid of it just just
[1:01:35] get rid of it because it's not going to
[1:01:36] do you any
[1:01:40] good he said so if you've got to that
[1:01:43] point and it hasn't changed anything and
[1:01:45] you're trying to hang on and it hasn't
[1:01:47] changed it hasn't produced anything he
[1:01:49] said now it's time for us to get in the
[1:01:50] altar we ought to come to the Altar and
[1:01:52] pray until something comes and takes
[1:01:55] place until we pray ourselves through
[1:01:57] then we ought to be right
[1:02:01] here see he says he said you know you
[1:02:05] see you understand it because you know
[1:02:06] every one of us has received this
[1:02:08] invitation
[1:02:10] amen just everybody has received well
[1:02:12] because the word has went forth and so
[1:02:14] you have received this invitation to
[1:02:16] receive it
[1:02:18] amen we see every one of them that
[1:02:21] received it then they were then
[1:02:23] something took place
[1:02:25] yes but you know just like the Rich
[1:02:27] Young Ruler you know when he came you
[1:02:29] know when he stood there and he took the
[1:02:31] what was what was given to him when he
[1:02:33] be you know he understood I need
[1:02:36] something from
[1:02:37] God and and you know he said he coming
[1:02:40] and you know he asked the Lord what do I
[1:02:43] what must I do to inherit eternal life
[1:02:46] because he realized you know I need
[1:02:47] eternal
[1:02:50] life and Jesus told him exactly what he
[1:02:52] needed and he began to speak to
[1:02:55] them see he began to speak to all of
[1:02:58] them and
[1:03:01] understand but just like the the Rich
[1:03:03] Young
[1:03:04] Ruler and the Pharisees and the
[1:03:06] Sadducees and so many of them they
[1:03:08] couldn't humble themselves to the word
[1:03:10] that's it they couldn't humble
[1:03:12] themselves because they got to the place
[1:03:14] where they they this this is this is
[1:03:16] where I'm
[1:03:17] at right and they didn't want to give up
[1:03:20] what they had oh no right they were
[1:03:22] hanging on to something and he said
[1:03:24] you'll not go any further until you
[1:03:26] humble yourself and lay all that aside
[1:03:29] right see that comes a time and so we
[1:03:32] see that the condition that the world is
[1:03:34] in
[1:03:35] today see as as it was back then brother
[1:03:38] R was talking about what took place back
[1:03:42] then this is from the uniting uh the
[1:03:44] uniting time and
[1:03:46] sign he said we see this uniting time
[1:03:49] coming he said and the church has United
[1:03:52] itself against the message and then when
[1:03:54] it does that the nations are uniting
[1:03:57] themselves in communism to destroy the
[1:03:58] church again just like it did in the
[1:04:00] first place he said Israel had to turn
[1:04:03] down the message first and when they
[1:04:06] turned down the message then the
[1:04:08] military the National Life United itself
[1:04:10] together of other nations and come in
[1:04:12] and destroy the church and today they
[1:04:15] have done turned down the message of the
[1:04:17] Lord Jesus and they've turned it down
[1:04:20] and now the time has come to where
[1:04:23] communism is uniting the world together
[1:04:25] against the church see it has to be that
[1:04:27] way amen he said now it's hard to say
[1:04:30] that but just like they done the word
[1:04:34] came to them the message went forth to
[1:04:37] them their message for their day what
[1:04:40] they were looking for came and it was
[1:04:43] manifest in flesh it stood before them
[1:04:46] and the Fulfillment of the word and
[1:04:49] because they turned it down they had to
[1:04:53] turn the message they had to turn the
[1:04:54] word down and when they turned it down
[1:04:57] then the Judgment came right because the
[1:05:00] Judgment was waiting them but you know
[1:05:02] what God showed them Grace to bring them
[1:05:04] to the truth but he turned because but
[1:05:06] he said as he said you know as but he
[1:05:09] came to his own and his own received him
[1:05:11] not but as many as has received them
[1:05:13] gave he power to
[1:05:15] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:05:19] believed on his name which were born not
[1:05:21] of blood nor the will of Flesh nor of
[1:05:23] the will of man but of God and he said
[1:05:26] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:05:27] among us and we beheld his glory the
[1:05:29] glory of the only begotten of the father
[1:05:32] full of grace and truth see because they
[1:05:35] were under they were under the message
[1:05:37] of Grace but in the wings was was the
[1:05:40] message of Destruction because that's
[1:05:43] what when they turned it down and
[1:05:45] because brother R talking about back
[1:05:46] then they had the Fulfillment of the
[1:05:48] word they had the fullness of the word
[1:05:51] and what has come in our day what where
[1:05:53] we living at today we're living in the
[1:05:55] day of the fullness of the word this is
[1:05:58] the Fulfillment of the word because
[1:05:59] Christ is made flesh again in our day we
[1:06:02] have just exactly the same thing that
[1:06:04] they have because now today we see
[1:06:07] because what took place back then they
[1:06:10] turned the word down and now there's
[1:06:12] nothing but but destruction there is
[1:06:14] nothing but judgment but praise God
[1:06:16] there's a group of people that have
[1:06:18] received the blessings the grace of God
[1:06:20] theyve received that word and you know
[1:06:22] what they will be out of here
[1:06:24] there is a judgment before the Judgment
[1:06:28] Falls see we see the world and the
[1:06:30] condition that it's in because how
[1:06:32] everything is all falling apart why
[1:06:35] because when you turn the word down then
[1:06:37] you will take everything that is
[1:06:39] contrary to the word and you will
[1:06:40] embrace it and you will preach it and
[1:06:42] and manifest it as truth and you're
[1:06:45] going to uh persecute and go against
[1:06:49] everybody that is standing for the truth
[1:06:51] amen right and because you see the
[1:06:54] condition that the world is in today and
[1:06:57] you know everything that that is right
[1:06:58] and
[1:07:01] proper when you see people you know they
[1:07:03] don't even have common decency for
[1:07:05] people anymore no that's right
[1:07:10] brother you know it's so amazing when
[1:07:12] you see these
[1:07:13] people and you know they you
[1:07:17] know they call them you know on on the
[1:07:20] internet and everything you see them and
[1:07:22] everybody talks about carens you know
[1:07:24] these people you know because you know
[1:07:26] all all their job is is to get in
[1:07:28] everybody's business it has nothing to
[1:07:31] do with them but you know what they will
[1:07:33] get so worked up that they'll actually
[1:07:35] get in a fight with somebody over
[1:07:38] something that they have no idea what
[1:07:39] they're doing
[1:07:41] right but because but they think they
[1:07:44] think that they're the law that the
[1:07:46] world revolves around them that you know
[1:07:48] they're the answer to the problem and
[1:07:50] they don't even know the problem but
[1:07:52] they will go out there and tell tell
[1:07:54] people that you've got to live a certain
[1:07:55] way you got to do a certain thing and
[1:07:57] they don't understand what's going
[1:07:59] on and argue and cuss and fuss and not
[1:08:03] even realize what's going
[1:08:05] on brother there was a video this lady
[1:08:09] this man walks up to this lady and tries
[1:08:11] to talk to her he just walked up to her
[1:08:13] car and then she's like you get away
[1:08:14] from me I'm calling the cops and she's
[1:08:16] standing there yelling at him the whole
[1:08:18] time and he's just like listen listen
[1:08:20] I'm just trying to tell you your purse
[1:08:23] is on top of your
[1:08:26] car that's all that's all I'm trying to
[1:08:28] tell
[1:08:29] you and then she reaches up and grabs
[1:08:31] her purse pulls it back in the car and
[1:08:33] says mind your own business and speeds
[1:08:41] off you know it's like you know and and
[1:08:44] the and the worst the worst problem is
[1:08:46] you you see all these people out there
[1:08:48] and you know it's
[1:08:49] like how handicapped are you I say you
[1:08:51] got a handicapped sticker we got to
[1:08:53] figure out who's handicapped and we and
[1:08:55] everybody's one this person's more
[1:08:57] handicapped than that
[1:08:59] person and you know and then then we
[1:09:02] then we live in a world where
[1:09:03] everybody's a
[1:09:05] victim you wake up in the morning every
[1:09:07] everybody's against me I have all these
[1:09:09] problems and then I'm GNA tell you I've
[1:09:11] got more problems than you God makes me
[1:09:13] a bigger victim than you so you know
[1:09:14] what you're supposed to cater to me
[1:09:19] right and the biggest problem is is they
[1:09:22] become a victim of the devil because
[1:09:25] he's got between their ears and that's
[1:09:26] the biggest
[1:09:29] problem and so you see these people the
[1:09:31] condition that they're in and yet they
[1:09:33] will get to the point where they'll
[1:09:34] actually fight
[1:09:36] people and it's like you you see these
[1:09:39] people and I mean you go to you go these
[1:09:42] places people got have gotten
[1:09:45] shot right and you see all these things
[1:09:48] take place what is it well you know they
[1:09:51] didn't treat me like I was supposed to
[1:09:56] and you see these people you know they
[1:09:58] they go to these stores and it's like
[1:10:00] well you know what they make too much
[1:10:02] money and they just all go in as a crowd
[1:10:04] and just steal everything that they got
[1:10:06] and walk out the door well you know I'm
[1:10:08] not paying for
[1:10:09] it and you see that you see the
[1:10:12] condition that the world is in and now
[1:10:13] everybody's like well you know what you
[1:10:15] don't have to work for anything you
[1:10:17] don't have to learn anything because you
[1:10:18] know what you just got to be a big
[1:10:21] enough victim and make and Proclaim that
[1:10:23] you're a victim long enough so somebody
[1:10:25] will cater to you and give everything
[1:10:27] you have
[1:10:29] yeah and you see this condition that
[1:10:31] people are
[1:10:34] in and not realizing see when when it
[1:10:37] just comes into utter
[1:10:41] chaos and and that's and that's the
[1:10:43] world that we live in yes and the
[1:10:45] problem and the problem is is when you
[1:10:47] go to talk to people and you try to tell
[1:10:49] people listen this world is not going to
[1:10:52] stand all of this
[1:10:55] this this stuff that you see every
[1:10:57] single day this is this is utter chaos
[1:11:01] this is Hell on Earth this this world
[1:11:04] will not
[1:11:06] stand when you see these people when it
[1:11:09] becomes more depraved every single day
[1:11:12] and all of a sudden you realize that
[1:11:13] these people have lost their minds and
[1:11:15] you know what they've got their hands on
[1:11:17] nuclear
[1:11:19] weapons
[1:11:22] y and all of a sudden well what's
[1:11:24] holding them off what's holding all this
[1:11:27] off what's holding off the Judgment come
[1:11:30] on there's only one thing that's holding
[1:11:32] off the judgment and that's the body of
[1:11:34] Christ the bride of Christ is here
[1:11:36] because the blood is still here because
[1:11:38] she's still here but there's one day
[1:11:40] that she's leaving the blood will be
[1:11:42] gone and all of a sudden then the
[1:11:44] judgment will
[1:11:51] fall see we see these
[1:11:57] things so we see who we are this is from
[1:12:00] the message of spoken words The Original
[1:12:02] Seed brother R says Christ couldn't help
[1:12:04] being who he was he was the son of God
[1:12:07] that's it see what I mean now see if you
[1:12:10] were intended you see the word of God
[1:12:13] you believe it because why there's
[1:12:15] something new see why he said have you
[1:12:19] ever heard of a strain in a family a son
[1:12:21] will kind of impersonate his father
[1:12:23] mother grandfather
[1:12:25] grandmother he said well that's the same
[1:12:28] thing from
[1:12:30] predestination you were supposed to be
[1:12:32] here in the right way at the beginning
[1:12:35] but being that you come the way you did
[1:12:38] you're subject to the fall but being
[1:12:40] that you're predestinated you hear the
[1:12:43] word it brings you right back where you
[1:12:46] were predestinated amen he said never
[1:12:49] saw that before brings you right what
[1:12:51] makes you believe the word of God and
[1:12:53] turn down these other things it's
[1:12:56] because you were there is something in
[1:12:58] you way back Yonder you're supposed what
[1:13:02] you made to live here forever amen so
[1:13:06] you had these
[1:13:08] things that's what it was because you
[1:13:12] were predestinated by God's for
[1:13:14] knowledge to come to these
[1:13:16] things why because you were predestined
[1:13:19] because he knew that you were coming
[1:13:21] that you would be here and the word of
[1:13:22] God would come your way and reach out
[1:13:24] and touch you and reach your path and
[1:13:27] that you would understand these things
[1:13:29] that you would receive it and there's
[1:13:31] many people out there that we won't
[1:13:33] receive it amen but praise God we were
[1:13:36] put here for one thing to receive this
[1:13:39] word but we're also put here to manifest
[1:13:41] the word why because there's still The
[1:13:43] Lost and the dying out there that have
[1:13:45] not heard the word but you know what we
[1:13:47] are also to be the ones to show the
[1:13:49] world the truth of the Gospel why
[1:13:52] because they've turned it down and they
[1:13:53] will not receive it but you know what
[1:13:55] there's still a witness God will always
[1:13:57] have a witness to the truth of the word
[1:13:59] in this world absolutely believe
[1:14:03] that so how many how many times have we
[1:14:06] had people that you know they they come
[1:14:07] along and you know they they try to tear
[1:14:10] down everything that the word says and
[1:14:13] you all the things that that has taken
[1:14:15] place but you know God has always had a
[1:14:18] witness amen God always has a witness to
[1:14:23] show the things when we see people
[1:14:26] trying to tear down the message and try
[1:14:27] to discredit everything and yet you know
[1:14:30] turns around there's people that come
[1:14:31] right on the scene and and are able to
[1:14:34] show the things that were there as the
[1:14:36] truth amen yes sir and they're like well
[1:14:39] you know nobody saw these things nobody
[1:14:41] never nobody saw the bridge nobody saw
[1:14:43] all these things and you know all of a
[1:14:44] sudden this this man you know some of
[1:14:46] y'all have seen the the video of the man
[1:14:48] that was the the lawyer you know his dad
[1:14:50] was mayor there and knew brother brandom
[1:14:54] he said as a child my dad told me he
[1:14:56] said he said uh brother Bill is
[1:15:00] Clairvoyant he said God shows him things
[1:15:03] that's how he explained
[1:15:04] it but well nobody knows about the
[1:15:07] bridge and that man was standing right
[1:15:08] there and he said my aunts and different
[1:15:10] people in my family knew that the bridge
[1:15:12] collapsed and knew those men died on the
[1:15:15] bridge and this man's not a message
[1:15:17] believer
[1:15:19] y but here's a man that grew up that had
[1:15:22] that knew brother br
[1:15:24] knew it his dad he said he said you know
[1:15:27] he talking about him and brother
[1:15:28] brandham would come to their house and
[1:15:30] you know he said brother Bram would sit
[1:15:32] and drink Coke or whatever and watch TV
[1:15:34] with his dad and
[1:15:36] talk and so these things and everybody's
[1:15:38] like well there's nobody all this stuff
[1:15:40] is made up and everything like that well
[1:15:41] you know what there's one
[1:15:43] witness well it took that one witness
[1:15:46] right there that man and you know what
[1:15:48] that man's testimony will judge them a
[1:15:51] judgment day it will be there to to face
[1:15:54] them that
[1:15:55] day that they had one believe
[1:15:58] that and so when when they say well
[1:16:01] these things didn't take place yeah
[1:16:03] there
[1:16:04] was there was one that was there to be a
[1:16:09] witness I think about brother Billy Paul
[1:16:12] when when he he tells the testimony
[1:16:14] years ago and he was talking about I
[1:16:15] believe it was a man was a was a dentist
[1:16:17] or whatever and he he went to him and
[1:16:19] the man asked him said he said Bill
[1:16:22] Billy uh he said have I ever done
[1:16:23] anything to you like no except what
[1:16:25] you're getting ready to do to me right
[1:16:28] now but you know he brought he brought a
[1:16:30] message book out and he put that in
[1:16:32] front of brother Billy Paul and he said
[1:16:36] why didn't you tell me about
[1:16:41] him Billy Paul not talking about his
[1:16:46] dad yeah and there was there was people
[1:16:49] that that found out from other people
[1:16:52] who who the what about the message who
[1:16:55] he was and he's like you never told me
[1:16:56] about your dad you never explained these
[1:17:00] things well how much more if the world's
[1:17:03] out there dying and you say you've not
[1:17:06] explained to me about your
[1:17:09] father not not not brother brandom
[1:17:16] no you know but your heavenly
[1:17:20] father if we're born again then
[1:17:23] the world wants to know who is your
[1:17:25] father why haven't you shared that with
[1:17:28] me come on you know many times you try
[1:17:31] to share people things with people and
[1:17:33] you know it don't even it don't even go
[1:17:36] it just goes right out your mouth and
[1:17:37] falls on the floor yeah right it doesn't
[1:17:39] go anywhere right brother but you know
[1:17:41] you never
[1:17:42] know you just share the gospel with
[1:17:45] people amen you never know what's going
[1:17:48] to take
[1:17:51] place cuzz it's not it's it's not our
[1:17:53] job to see it come to pass come to
[1:17:57] fruition our job is to sew the
[1:17:59] seed right that's
[1:18:02] right see if we understand these
[1:18:09] things and we take the things that that
[1:18:11] were given to us and know this is from
[1:18:14] the message the Investments and
[1:18:15] brother's talking about the Rich Young
[1:18:17] Ruler here as I was quoting earlier you
[1:18:20] know when he was talking about the the
[1:18:21] Rich Young Ruler see he knew what he was
[1:18:26] lacking and he said you know he never
[1:18:29] asked you know D he to join your church
[1:18:31] everything like that but he knew that he
[1:18:33] lacked eternal life and he said there's
[1:18:35] only one form of eternal life we strive
[1:18:37] for that and we was given that
[1:18:39] opportunity to receive it when he re
[1:18:41] when he when he asked because it's
[1:18:44] written asking you shall receive and it
[1:18:46] was presented to him and yet foolish
[1:18:48] enough to turn down because the price
[1:18:50] was too great he said you can't hold to
[1:18:53] the love of the world and to God at the
[1:18:56] same time for you cannot love God and
[1:18:59] Mammon which means the world and you if
[1:19:01] you love the world or the things of the
[1:19:03] world the love of God the love of the
[1:19:06] father isn't isn't in
[1:19:09] you see he had all of the things of the
[1:19:13] world that he wanted the great riches
[1:19:15] and all these things that he had and he
[1:19:18] had everything at his grasp all the
[1:19:21] things natural right but he had
[1:19:24] everything Supernatural everything
[1:19:25] spiritual in front of
[1:19:27] him and he had it right there in front
[1:19:29] of him and he turned it down he couldn't
[1:19:32] see the value in it because he he valued
[1:19:36] his riches too much the things that he
[1:19:39] held back that he held him back that's
[1:19:41] right he realized what he needed but it
[1:19:43] was too great of
[1:19:46] price and he said see he held on to
[1:19:48] those things brother R says you know he
[1:19:50] said I don't care if you own the whole
[1:19:52] world the whole world he said if you
[1:19:53] haven't accepted the leadership of the
[1:19:55] eternal life by the Holy Ghost how's it
[1:19:58] going to who are you anyhow he said
[1:20:03] you're a dead mortal dead in sin and
[1:20:05] trespasses righteous as you want to be
[1:20:08] as faithful as you want to be to the
[1:20:10] church preacher if you want to be in the
[1:20:13] pull pit but to turn down you die when
[1:20:17] you had everything in front of you
[1:20:19] eternal life laid before him and had
[1:20:23] everything that he had need
[1:20:24] of and he was so tied up in that eternal
[1:20:28] life everlasting life he said anything
[1:20:31] that's Eternal never did begin therefore
[1:20:32] it cannot end Eternal never begins and
[1:20:35] then the only way that you can be
[1:20:37] Eternal is to receive eternal life amen
[1:20:40] and there is only one thing Eternal and
[1:20:43] that's God not by joining church or
[1:20:45] Creeds or turning a new page on new
[1:20:47] years's or whatever it might be but it's
[1:20:49] receiving God the person of God in the
[1:20:53] form of the holy spirit in your life and
[1:20:56] you become part of God and just as
[1:20:58] Eternal as he is because you're a part
[1:21:00] of him everything has a beginning has an
[1:21:04] end but see when you when you pass that
[1:21:08] because God never had a beginning so he
[1:21:11] never has an end and when you become
[1:21:13] that he said and that word and that word
[1:21:17] in you produces the Life of
[1:21:19] Christ and it it could and if I could
[1:21:22] take the life out of a peach tree and
[1:21:24] put it in a pear it would bear peaches
[1:21:27] no more it would bear peaches no
[1:21:30] more it would bear pears on it because
[1:21:33] the life of the tree would produce it he
[1:21:35] said the life that's in you shows what
[1:21:39] you are your life testifies so loud in
[1:21:42] you until your testimony is not heard
[1:21:46] they know what they what you are by the
[1:21:49] life you live and the things that you do
[1:21:51] if the life of Christ is in you then
[1:21:54] therefore the works of the Life of
[1:21:57] Christ you live because that's his life
[1:22:00] living through you am you're just a
[1:22:02] vessel to carry on the work of God
[1:22:06] Amen so when we see these
[1:22:09] things see when you when you take these
[1:22:12] things the world's going to see who you
[1:22:14] are
[1:22:16] y isn't that isn't that wonderful that
[1:22:19] the life that that you live if you would
[1:22:23] just take the life everybody's well I
[1:22:26] you know I I wish I could be a Christian
[1:22:28] I could wish I could be a Christ I wish
[1:22:29] I could do these things I wish I could
[1:22:31] do these things well you know the
[1:22:33] problem is is you're trying to do
[1:22:36] it you can't do
[1:22:39] it the problem is is you've got to yield
[1:22:42] to him
[1:22:43] amen that's it see the tree doesn't bear
[1:22:48] fruit of
[1:22:49] itself the life brings the fruit a sheep
[1:22:54] doesn't doesn't bear wol because it sits
[1:22:55] out there
[1:22:57] thinking um going to bring bring forth
[1:23:00] wool going to bring forth you see I'm
[1:23:03] and he's out
[1:23:06] there what does he
[1:23:09] do he rests and
[1:23:13] relaxes he's in he's in a sheep out
[1:23:16] there what what is he doing he's in the
[1:23:18] hands of the
[1:23:19] shepherd but the life that's inside the
[1:23:22] Sheep is what bearss wool because he's a
[1:23:25] sheep that is that is the
[1:23:27] sign and what does he do he follows the
[1:23:30] shepherd and
[1:23:32] eats as brother Joe was talking about
[1:23:34] the other day you know when you know
[1:23:36] when in Psalm I believe Psalms 23 when
[1:23:39] he was talking about you know in the
[1:23:42] beside the Green Pastures he Le to be
[1:23:44] beside Green
[1:23:45] Pastures and he said when you stand
[1:23:47] there looking at the place that that
[1:23:49] David was standing talking about all the
[1:23:51] rocks that are there well you know that
[1:23:52] don't that don't look like what we would
[1:23:54] expect to be there right but you know
[1:23:57] what the shepherd knows what way to lead
[1:23:59] them and lead them to the place where
[1:24:02] they need to
[1:24:04] feed and then all of a sudden they when
[1:24:06] they know when the shepherd is taking
[1:24:08] care of them and lead them to the right
[1:24:10] place and eating the right things and
[1:24:11] you know what then all of a sudden they
[1:24:14] just start producing
[1:24:16] that well you don't have you it's the
[1:24:18] same way with you and I if we are the a
[1:24:21] child of God then you know what we don't
[1:24:24] have to worry about well you know I'm
[1:24:25] I'm going to try to do this I'm going to
[1:24:26] try to do
[1:24:29] no and you say well I've got this
[1:24:31] problem brother I've got this problem
[1:24:32] well let me tell you something the same
[1:24:34] one that brought if you're in
[1:24:35] justification the same one that brought
[1:24:37] you there because you know what you
[1:24:39] didn't get you don't justify yourself
[1:24:41] you don't get your placees you don't get
[1:24:43] yourself to
[1:24:44] justification because it's the goodness
[1:24:46] of God that leads you to repentance so
[1:24:48] when you when you repent it's the
[1:24:50] leading of the Lord to you to to come to
[1:24:52] that place sanctification takes the word
[1:24:55] but you know what it's the word of God
[1:24:57] that does that the Holy Spirit has to do
[1:24:59] that right because you know so many
[1:25:02] times how many we we've tried to do that
[1:25:04] ourselves we we TR we I I want to fix
[1:25:06] this problem and I want to fix that
[1:25:08] problem I want to give this up I want to
[1:25:09] do that you know the more times we do
[1:25:11] that we get frustrated we get overworked
[1:25:13] and everything like that and the devil
[1:25:15] just comes to and
[1:25:16] says you ain't
[1:25:18] nothing why don't you just give up y
[1:25:23] I would I I I would be I just quit doing
[1:25:25] I I you're such an
[1:25:29] embarrassment you know I would I would I
[1:25:31] wouldn't tell nobody I go church if I
[1:25:32] live like
[1:25:35] that well praise God you know what I'm
[1:25:37] just going to continue on yeah right
[1:25:40] well you know what God started God
[1:25:42] started me on this journey and you know
[1:25:43] what God brought me this far and you
[1:25:45] know what I just got to keep putting my
[1:25:47] hand just keeping it putting in God's
[1:25:49] hands and wait on him because you know
[1:25:51] he's the one that's gonna come because
[1:25:52] you know if you stay the course because
[1:25:55] he's going to show you the way to go but
[1:25:56] if you continue in the way if you
[1:25:59] continue in the path that he's called
[1:26:00] you and you continue to go that way and
[1:26:02] just keep holding on then you know what
[1:26:04] you're going to come to the place that
[1:26:05] one day you're going to realize that the
[1:26:07] things of the world have no more hold on
[1:26:09] you why because the word is coming into
[1:26:11] you and as you feed on the word now you
[1:26:13] can't now you can't feed on everything
[1:26:15] in in the world and and you know all the
[1:26:17] all the garbage and everything like that
[1:26:19] youve got to you got to deal just put
[1:26:21] all that to a to the side you've got to
[1:26:23] come to the place where the one thing
[1:26:25] that you're feeding on the one thing you
[1:26:26] desire is the word of God and put
[1:26:29] everything else to theide and do away
[1:26:32] with
[1:26:32] it and feed on the word and meditate on
[1:26:35] the word of God and see if it doesn't
[1:26:37] change who you are it doesn't change
[1:26:39] your appetite doesn't change your
[1:26:43] desire and quit trying because you know
[1:26:46] you try well I you know I I want to do
[1:26:48] this
[1:26:49] no I want to walk the way God want wants
[1:26:52] me to walk I want to walk the path he's
[1:26:55] called me to
[1:26:57] walk I want to live the way he wants me
[1:27:00] to
[1:27:01] live amen let's all stand we'll have the
[1:27:03] musicians
[1:27:05] come I want to live the way he wants me
[1:27:07] to live I want to do what God has called
[1:27:10] me to do amen I want to do these things
[1:27:12] because God is leading the
[1:27:15] way because many times people say as
[1:27:18] they as the old saying is is you know I
[1:27:20] I want you know I've been in the way a
[1:27:21] long
[1:27:23] time well that's what's hindering us
[1:27:25] lots of times is we're in the way we get
[1:27:28] in God's
[1:27:30] way but if we can just commit ourselves
[1:27:32] to the Lord and say Lord I you know I
[1:27:35] every and every step of the way amen the
[1:27:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the same
[1:27:41] way you you yield yourselves to him amen
[1:27:45] and see if he doesn't do the work
[1:27:48] amen and everything else that as you go
[1:27:51] up the statue of a perfect what is it
[1:27:52] it's more yielding of
[1:27:55] yourself right and just continue I'm I'm
[1:27:59] just going to yield myself because you
[1:28:00] know the Devil he's going to fight you
[1:28:03] all the way but you know what every time
[1:28:05] there's a victory yeah and you say what
[1:28:08] about that
[1:28:10] devil he brought he brought me this far
[1:28:13] y right look at the things I've overcome
[1:28:16] but you know I didn't overcome them it
[1:28:17] was him through me I overcame and I
[1:28:20] overcome this well then what's the next
[1:28:21] B you know I overcome well you know it
[1:28:24] was you
[1:28:25] know Abraham held on to a
[1:28:29] promise God gave him a promise of what
[1:28:32] was going to take place that they was
[1:28:33] going he was going to bring forth a son
[1:28:34] well you know what he got
[1:28:36] older and weaker and more
[1:28:40] feeble true but you know he continued to
[1:28:43] hold on and he had faults and failures
[1:28:46] and problems but you know what the word
[1:28:48] didn't change the promise didn't change
[1:28:51] and you know even when he got off course
[1:28:53] and went the wrong way you know what God
[1:28:54] put him right back on the right track he
[1:28:56] kept going thank you Lord and he kept
[1:28:58] going the right way and he kept going he
[1:28:59] kept going well guess what there was a
[1:29:02] day that he come by Revelation you know
[1:29:04] what he realized that it wasn't him but
[1:29:07] it was God who made the
[1:29:09] promise and you know he began to walk in
[1:29:12] that promise and there was a day that he
[1:29:14] woke up and you know he began to see
[1:29:17] that son I'm still getting older still
[1:29:20] getting more problems everything like
[1:29:22] that but you know he began to see the
[1:29:24] Sun and he walked into that and one day
[1:29:27] when he saw that he continued to walk
[1:29:29] and the next thing he had a body change
[1:29:33] right if you can see the son whom the
[1:29:37] son has set free is free
[1:29:40] indeed well if you've been set free then
[1:29:42] you know what you've been set free from
[1:29:45] everything because if you've been
[1:29:47] Justified he that he is Justified he's
[1:29:49] already glorified well if he started you
[1:29:51] you on this journey then you know what
[1:29:53] he's going to finish this journey
[1:29:54] because he's already brought you but you
[1:29:56] know you can see your by your vision by
[1:29:59] your faith you can see there's already a
[1:30:00] body change the body change is already
[1:30:04] here it's all but you walk into that you
[1:30:06] just continue to
[1:30:07] walk that's right no matter what anybody
[1:30:09] else does you continue to walk in that
[1:30:13] and that's the good
[1:30:15] news and that's our commission to share
[1:30:17] the good news to everybody sir what a
[1:30:22] Thanksgiving I was thinking about
[1:30:23] brother Brandon preaching the invisible
[1:30:24] Union understanding who the bride the
[1:30:27] senual of virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[1:30:30] he said what kind of what kind of
[1:30:32] Thanksgiving message is that the
[1:30:33] greatest Thanksgiving message when you
[1:30:36] begin to see who you are what a
[1:30:38] Thanksgiving that is when you begin to
[1:30:40] see who you are where you've come from
[1:30:43] when you've come from from the the poor
[1:30:46] and you you come from all of the what he
[1:30:48] has brought you from your sin and
[1:30:50] trespasses and brought you into the
[1:30:52] Glorious Liberty of Jesus
[1:30:54] Christ what a wonderful
[1:30:57] thing well I'm I'm going quit cuz I

[1:38:45] the Philippines twice so I know how it
[1:38:47] is about going and being away from your
[1:38:50] your natural family but it's the work of
[1:38:53] God am it's the work of God it's like
[1:38:55] brother Donnie Reagan said yesterday I
[1:38:56] was listening to him he said he said you
[1:38:58] know he said when a man takes the the
[1:39:01] the ministry that we have this the
[1:39:03] ministry we have that's a committal for
[1:39:07] Life MH you're a minister it doesn't
[1:39:09] matter if you never preach another
[1:39:11] sermon if you've been called to a
[1:39:12] Ministry and you're ministering that
[1:39:14] Ministry is there all the time right and
[1:39:16] you you you neglect family sometimes you
[1:39:19] neglect friends sometimes
[1:39:22] to do what we
[1:39:24] are commissioned to do and now the
[1:39:27] commission is is to go all into the
[1:39:30] world and preach the gospel is as Jesus
[1:39:32] told us and like what brother Dan
[1:39:33] daisley or no what brother Dan and
[1:39:35] brother green said if you can't go send
[1:39:37] somebody so we're going to send them and
[1:39:39] we're going to send them with the
[1:39:40] blessing of the Lord in these prayer clo
[1:39:42] we're going to we're going to see not
[1:39:44] just one Miracle we'll see Miracles out
[1:39:45] of this yes sir
[1:39:47] also brother way and I talked about this
[1:39:50] I know some of you you give money to to
[1:39:53] brother Louise to take with him I'll be
[1:39:55] here Sunday if anybody wants to give any
[1:39:58] other offerings cuz I know they're
[1:40:00] leaving Friday they're leaving this
[1:40:01] coming Friday here Sunday if anybody
[1:40:03] else wants to give and you're leaving
[1:40:04] the next I leave the next Friday the
[1:40:06] next Friday December 1st December 1st
[1:40:09] sure go ahead just real real quick um
[1:40:12] when we pray the first place where I'm
[1:40:15] going to be going to and there's a
[1:40:18] situation that I found out about down
[1:40:20] there in the in the church that I'm one
[1:40:23] of the churches that I'm going to go to
[1:40:25] that I just I didn't know anything about
[1:40:27] it's a very delicate situation regarding
[1:40:30] the
[1:40:31] pastor and uh and I just ask that that
[1:40:35] you all pray that the Lord would just
[1:40:38] give me wisdom as I minister in that
[1:40:40] place because I do not want to take any
[1:40:43] sides no and I do not want to but but I
[1:40:46] believe that talking about the miracle I
[1:40:48] believe that there's a miracle that can
[1:40:49] happen right there amen cuz I even
[1:40:51] talked to the pastor the other last week
[1:40:53] on the phone just letting him know
[1:40:56] listen I'm I'm I'm I'm going to be there
[1:40:58] but and he really really respected the
[1:41:01] fact that I called him to talk to him
[1:41:03] Wonder wonderful and he said I believe
[1:41:05] he he told me he said I believe the Lord
[1:41:07] is doing something already so um because
[1:41:10] there's been ministers have already gone
[1:41:12] through there without even talking to
[1:41:13] the pastor and and it's just it's been
[1:41:16] it's been a mess I could go with all
[1:41:17] details but I'm not going to but just
[1:41:19] remember me in prayer that the Lord will
[1:41:21] give me wisdom for that situation amen
[1:41:23] amen appreciate that
[1:41:26] amen all right so let's all agree let's
[1:41:29] bow our heads and we'll pray over these
[1:41:30] cloths if you'll lay your hands on them
[1:41:32] and wherever these go we've seen
[1:41:34] Miracles we've seen cancer leave we've
[1:41:36] seen people healed just by giving these
[1:41:39] prayer claws so it's not a Hocus Pocus
[1:41:41] it's it is according to the word of God
[1:41:44] Paul's not here but the god of Paul is
[1:41:46] here and the god of Paul is what healed
[1:41:49] those people not Paul's cloth
[1:41:51] right but it is a contact that we're
[1:41:54] going to send over there from this
[1:41:55] church and through our brothers we're
[1:41:57] going to send this contact and this
[1:41:59] contact wherever it goes and you hand
[1:42:01] that prayer cloth to somebody there's
[1:42:02] your connection that they know that you
[1:42:05] this is behind them 100% we're all
[1:42:07] behind them this ministry is behind them
[1:42:10] and and the god that we serve is behind
[1:42:12] it and this is just something it's a
[1:42:15] vehicle to to to build their faith
[1:42:17] that's what they did with Paul oh Paul
[1:42:19] he was an apostle he we saw Miracles
[1:42:21] yeah I'll take his cloth there and and I
[1:42:23] know God was with him well it wasn't
[1:42:25] Paul's anointing it was God's anointing
[1:42:28] through Paul so we're going to send this
[1:42:30] through the Spoken Word Church to our
[1:42:31] brothers here our ministers and we're
[1:42:33] going to see miracle I didn't know
[1:42:35] anything about that you never told me
[1:42:37] about that so I didn't know that there's
[1:42:39] one already starting there's a miracle
[1:42:41] in the making I think is what the song
[1:42:43] says amen so we're going to see it
[1:42:45] fulfilled when it gets there though so
[1:42:47] let's all bow our heads and believe dear
[1:42:49] heavenly father Lord Jesus in the name
[1:42:52] of the Lord Jesus Lord wherever these
[1:42:53] prayer clocks go Lord number one we pray
[1:42:56] Lord that that there's Mighty Works
[1:42:59] behind it father you told us Lord that
[1:43:02] even in the scripture that evil spirits

[1:43:07] laid Lord You're the same God and Lord I
[1:43:11] pray Lord that you'd be with our

[1:47:38] so don't eat too much but eat all you
[1:47:41] can like brother Aaron said it should be
[1:47:43] a Thanksgiving every day but we do have
[1:47:45] a day set aside to be thankful that God
[1:47:48] did give us a country that we're free
[1:47:50] free enough that we can go to those
[1:47:51] other countries and take the gospel to
[1:47:54] them because as as people have always
[1:47:56] said what if brother Randon was to had
[1:47:59] to come from Africa right or come from
[1:48:02] uh Tanzania or or uh uh who was it said
[1:48:06] they're going to Tasmania oh brother
[1:48:08] Chris long I said that's a good place
[1:48:09] for you to go
[1:48:11] Tasmania anyway praise the Lord but U
[1:48:16] why he'd want to go but the Lord wants
[1:48:17] him to go there's bride there there's
[1:48:19] bride there that's right you been there
[1:48:22] no Australia oh yeah you have been to
[1:48:25] Australia that's right but there's bride
[1:48:27] everywhere and God's we're gleaning to
[1:48:30] the last last group of people and if it
[1:48:32] takes brother Louise to to help a
[1:48:35] brother it don't just help that brother
[1:48:37] it helps the whole
[1:48:38] church that's why Dad many years ago we
[1:48:41] built we built a lot of churches and we
[1:48:43] built some houses and we built some of
[1:48:45] this and we built some of that well then
[1:48:47] he said no we're not going to do that
[1:48:48] anymore we're going to give it to the
[1:48:51] brothers and let them take it like
[1:48:53] brother Vernon and somebody come to him
[1:48:55] and say I've got a a leading of the Lord
[1:48:57] Brother Danny to go to a certain place
[1:48:59] well then the funds that you produce for
[1:49:01] them that we send them every month
[1:49:03] brother Vernon gives them 400 or
[1:49:06] whatever the plane ticket is to get to
[1:49:08] where they're going well listen if one
[1:49:10] person in that Community is
[1:49:12] helped listen you can leave and come
[1:49:15] back but God stays there with that
[1:49:17] person that's the way Paul did Paul
[1:49:19] would take a group of people and he
[1:49:21] would raise them up the Ephesians that's
[1:49:23] why he went to Corinth why he went to
[1:49:24] Ephesus he had to go back to Corinth
[1:49:26] twice but still it doesn't matter all
[1:49:28] right so he sends people like that but I
[1:49:31] told him many times in especially in the
[1:49:34] Philippines I said we can spend our time
[1:49:36] for three weeks and I can go preach for
[1:49:37] 15 different
[1:49:39] churches it's just an American coming to
[1:49:42] preach and everybody glories and
[1:49:44] everybody's
[1:49:46] happy but why not bring the ministers in
[1:49:49] right and have a ministers meeting like
[1:49:51] we did in palow when about 55 ministers
[1:49:53] were there and we got to teach a little
[1:49:55] bit on the seals and even so much to
[1:49:58] where a brother got Revelation and he
[1:49:59] started preaching him himself just you
[1:50:02] know teaching the others in in their
[1:50:03] native language that's best because I'm
[1:50:05] going to leave brother Luis is coming
[1:50:08] back Sister Christine coming back
[1:50:09] brother they're coming back here you
[1:50:11] better that's right amen you better it
[1:50:14] ain't a one way ticket amen thank you
[1:50:17] okay I'm not okay but when they come
[1:50:19] back
[1:50:21] God's still there that's right that's
[1:50:23] why there's a door there's an entrance
[1:50:25] been made there's a door been open amen
[1:50:28] and this church has been a a very
[1:50:29] intrical part of of going to different
[1:50:31] places and and forwarding the gospel to
[1:50:34] the foreign countries and we sure do
[1:50:36] appreciate uh what the church has done
[1:50:38] here over the years uh we give a lot of
[1:50:40] money for a little church as we are and
[1:50:42] we sure appreciate brother Dale doing
[1:50:43] that cuz he had a mind of of giving
[1:50:46] anyway so we appreciate that so just
[1:50:48] remember them in prayer and just have a
[1:50:49] happy Thanksgiving and let's let's sing
[1:50:51] that song one more time I want to live
[1:50:54] the way he wants me to live and you'll
[1:50:56] just be dismissed be with your family be
[1:50:59] be careful be safe on the
[1:51:01] highway the
[1:51:04] way he
[1:51:09] wants
