TRANSCRIPT
========================================
then you can write coming in if you want to you feel any way you want to but this is a seven-year covenant this is according to Daniel 920 what seven let's go back to Daniel let's make sure I really want to do this today but I felt led to do it so you're going to just barely I'm going to do in a few weeks but I thought what's good today all right verse 27 and he shall confirm the covenant for one week neither did we tell you that he was Antichrist little age he shall make a covenant confirm the covenant with many for one week this is the Covenant made by the Antichrist all right and the whole week has to be covered in the seventy weeks of Daniel because that's what the explanation is right know therefore and understand from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem is 62 week or seven weeks sixty-two weeks which makes how much 69 not 65 67 68 and 69 69 weeks are over according to the Bible in the province message 69 weeks of Daniel has already been fulfilled there's one week left after the rapture of the church that's the week that we're going to deal with now alright so that's why you got rapture of the church right here and to begin because we're flowing in this direction alright you're going to be we're going to be flowing in this direction if I got that we're going to be going from the rapture of the church because there's how many weeks and down Sam you wait I'm how many years 49 he's only having been taking right now 483 483 plus seven equals what or 94 that one week left to finish now listen I keep telling to finish the redemption of Israel and the gem the temple I redemptions over when we go into rapture so there's no more Gentiles this is not a Gentile week really has nothing to do with the Gentiles but the Gentiles are interlaced in this because the church nominal church foolish virgins ones without the Holy Ghost are going to go through this time of trouble that we're going to talk about a little bit okay daddy and in the middle of this week and he showed the confirm the coat with me for one week and week and in the midst of the week what's the middle of seven and a half and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and ablation the season for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even into the consummation right here put Battle of Armageddon you can ride anywhere you want to well you can well hey there's two something's in there to these two DS there's two days a RM e ra hey g.e.d do am jealous that's it ally in him do like me but battle of Armageddon you do not know what that was why do I need ride all around let's tell I can shorthand shorthand well battle of Anna then that'll fit bad Armageddon so cut Battle of Armageddon right down that's won the battle Armageddon will happen alright everybody got that now remember your chart here you got to keep it because this is the same chart is that one Gentile rapture one week equal seven year then we're going to start adding into this stuff here because the six-fold purpose has to do what finish everything his ruse redemption has to be in this seven year period and the rebuilding of the temple and the writing end of the millennium all those things have to happen inside this week that's why I said there's no way that according to what people preaching the message in brother Ram did not preach this that there's only that much left tough of earthly time to fulfill the 70th week now remember time goes all the way to the end of the millennium took the Raptor took place today there'd be a thousand and seven years left but only seven years to fulfil nineteen seventy weeks of Daniel seventy weeks there is a time that it ends but it doesn't really end it blends that's right it blends in sure it has what has to happen if remember I told you about the temple they built the temple they said we built a temple 46 years recorded it took 46 years but it took 49 physical years perhaps that what I'm saying we gonna move this before let me go over it again what happened is like me and dad we built my house in a year a physical year but it took a year in three months cuz we took some time off go hunting with took some time off go do this you know according to mama we took a lot of time off but we took time off and done this and that the other but we built in any year I tell maybe we took a year off working building they took more than a physical year but it only took us 365 days and buildings when you understand what they were doing because the scripture says they said it was 46 years building this temple well according to the Bible is 49 years he took them to build the temple took 49 physical years okay but it only took them 46 probably they would write down a recorded year when they stopped because remember that stopped many times we showed that in ezra and nehemiah they'd stop they just quit building then they start back again we're recording 46 years recorded 49 years physical years because remember Daniel 70 weeks there's only one gal medina 70 weeks and that's the what the grafting in and the Bible says that so we're going by the Bible the Bible says that we were in grafted into this olive tree were the wild olive branch God's going to take that wild olive branch which is his pride take us home and then start dealing with the Jews again to finish the 70 weeks of them they'll break up there you should this is this should be something that that when somebody says something man your mind just go clue I know what that means but it's going to take all this dick fuld purpose that's why there's no way that you can jam all this over here and only have three and a half years left because Jesus did not bring in everlasting righteousness setups vision property in normal told that's to happen now you know in the end time all right temple bill y'all done got way ahead stop we're talking about the rapture the Gentile go some of y'all's preconceived ideas has already been destroyed some of your shaking your head yeah so we're going to destroy a few more probably do we get over to here we're at the rapture of the church then we're going to do this right here but there's a lot that goes on in here a lot that goes on inside that's seven year period that's when I say again one more time brother round and ever preached this is going through and a half years of time time you hear me to fulfill the seven two weeks down there's only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry to be fulfilled absolutely no doubt most people even delighted to nomination Alicia preachers before the preachers in the message get that denominational dock in front is that he preached three and a half years here so there's only three and a half years left here we proved by all these dates by the Prophet by the days and by the Bible that sure he preached ran out of years but they cut him off they cut him off and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off he doesn't say after threescore in one week after sixty two weeks the massage gonna be cut off they totally rejected him at Calvary that were remember we looked at work cut off up that makes kill now they didn't kill him when he was starting you know I mean they ain't kill him 80 in this first part of his ministry the kill him at the end of his ministry alright so they killed him after sixty two weeks ago whistle 62 plus 7 is how much thank you 59 so there's no half weeks in here their wares one week left after the rapture you can't make me believe it any other way and I won't prove it to you a little bit further by dates okay you need to overhear work he was cut off the reason he was cut off with people I made those two Brendan gentle sin and that's why he's got seven more on me that's not exactly true he was cut off for everybody yeah I mean he was killed for sin he was killed for sin God blinded their eyes so that they couldn't come to the bay pick off but the man Pentecost was 30 days 40 days after he died so you can't really do that means you gotta be any days no he was cut off at 80 30 I have two three score 2 weeks he was cut off okay they rejected him he they said let his blood be on us and our children all right then God blinded their eyes now you can't say to that he glided ever do that cuz 120 up room Raji's now the 3000 downstairs were mingled we went over that you may go over to the game or damp and cough is a literal day remember we went through our our feast day Dave a tough day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost was fully come what happened what people had gathered in from all over the nation's to celebrate the day of Pentecost okay could it wasn't a it was a day to come in and celebrate cuz it's viste so what happened to 3,000 downstairs civil man we hear these people speaking in their own language and there was probably 70 or 80 different languages standing out in this crowd and Peter's talking and they're all hearing them in their same language the three times intense start speaking in tongues to receive hope that's where the Pentecost will get wrong they said no you got speaking in tongues no it's not the stickiness to hearing we heard them all in our language so so what happened was when they received the Holy Ghost it fell been on three thousand people that were mingled on nations but the first hundred twenty was Jews what he done is is he blinded those eyes of the ones that said let his blood be on us in our children got it he blinded their eyes he blinded the nation of Israel remember Israel's not him individual that's why the 120 watched 120 any upper room where individuals yes they rent they were yeah he's all they were jus yeah they would used but they were individual people sitting in an upper ring the nation of Israel s'what turning God now all right the nation of is a question comprises people but really what happened is is to just make the bottom line the 144,000 that was to be chosen wasn't there their ancestors were there okay because remember 144,000 gonna be saved over here not there they're gonna be safe here so the ancestors said let his blood be on us and our children had to go do a cleansing process report God blinded their eyes come all the way back over here and then all of a sudden he's going to what take the wall authorized or not say wool but take the veil thank you the bell off their eyes and they're going to see what their ancestors missed and then Israel still not as a nation get it right now remember it's not the nation of Israel not going to be safe that's right but you'll hear program say years will be saved as a nation now who's a nation who was the nation of Israel that was 144,000 well it was those twelve tribes the twelve tribes it mighta been hundred forty four thousand member they were millions back then hmm but there was twelve tribes Jesus Jesus will God Jesus told him said you got twelve tribes you got Ashley have 13 de lis box were not part of the twelve tribes of Israel remember it was once like you were speaking Wednesday night with you that was good good job the lead box was right here in the middle three three three and three now what is three times four equals and the Levites were not part of the twelve they were part of the ministry they were to minister to the people right now what happened to remember when what Dan and Ephraim was taken out Joseph and Levi was put in but to go back brother Brown remember he explains it in the in the seals they come right back into order because you gotta have it back in order to be the right crowd right okay got it now that's a whole new subject for a whole new day but when it says they were saved as a nation to visit because God's don't at the end that last half of the week he's only dealing with Israel he's not dealing with any Gentile he's not the last half of the way now the first time doing he's not doing well yeah when he's pulling out 144 first part of the way you gotta make sure everybody realize it's the first part of the week that happens not the last part that's what I'm telling you y'all get in the head you get in computing first half of the weeks is one to twelve hundred and sixty days that there is nobody here except the redeem that come back to build temple we're not even here we're not here we're not back to here yes ma'am the Levites are part of the twelves that mean you're happy that's a question you out that brother them he knows more about that night doing really i don't understand all that but i think he does and he lit he can explain that but really asking people of you to ask him that r and I'm not him are not putting you up I'm just saying I can't explain it in the time that we have to explain it but Dad preached on how long i mean you know several years ago about how God took the two tribes dominating put them back in and that's really interesting to know what happened when they do that but we're getting off our subject let's get back on his own okay hey wait yes ma'am is this way the rapture of the Jets on with that with that fake series black behind you get that is correct to a degree 2 degree that fakes here do you that baby it is it is not let stop say it's fake they were serious when they made misunderstood they were serious when they made it okay they made it in all sincerity with the light that they could see what I mean it was the Antichrist is that he has slipped into the denominational world taught them a doctrine that wasn't true and then they may dilute the other and that's correct cuz when we go when we leave when we leave the sea that's worthy you can leave the denominational world things we have a seven year tribulation they think it's going to happen here and that they're going to be saved because now what most of your denominational world plus that guy we were watching the other night jesus is coming back right here yeah if I see that right here what's happening in the denominational world there's going to be a rapture of a church right then there's going to be a great tribulation that people are going to be saved now this is not our doctrine this is the doctrine of the denominational church okay maybe this is why we did this okay to understand this better they say that we have a seven-year tribulation and it into the tribulation this is wherever i'll see and every knee shall bow in Jesus will come in the clouds of glory but remember the interpretation is wrong the interpretation is yeah he's coming back right here but he's not coming back to get somebody he's coming back with somebody paid okay he's already picked her up in a secret rapture yeah the denominational world's don't have to be killed for the gospel that they hold on to but now look when they die they gotta go to a thousand years of staying there Google in Revelation this is those that died have lived not till the thousand years and over you say well I center yeah that's centers but it's also people that are saved foods version a cup of water my name anybody's been going to be giving eternal life that hasn't already received eternal life here one so important to receive a new birth here because you're going to stand over here from your own words remember bill Deltron my chosen in him that's the reason we don't go to no tribulation we took it right here so we're chosen in that man that took our tribulation so we go in after day week on rapture we're clean we've already got a glorified body we don't have any new steps to take the milk a with that but now right here if you're still a Gentile and you're alive when they're apt to take play you've got steps to go through you got it you're either going to turn got down and go to hell and not going to hell here that's why you're not in heaven or hell now you're in a you're in a holding place my brother Brown don't have to go to those dimensions to show that you're not in a literal burning hell right now you're not literal heaven you're not grandma's not walking the streets ago she's sitting over there under a shade tree talking to brother branham on a rock all right and they're waiting on us right okay so but when we resurrect and going to rapture then we go to the marriage supper room we do the things that we do there but we're coming back right here terrain a thousand years which is not heaven heavens not go to the future home I'm Way over here that's when the streets of gold in Revelation 21 or 22 when John sees the holy city coming down I've way over here remember and we're that's why we're going to piece this together because the Bible says we will build and have it and I was at 65 that's not the future home that's not heaven that's right that's here on earth yes we're not going to build a house up there I think he just said I'm going to build you a play right right well it's not it's your building it is you're building your desires but right here is one of those going to be or my brother brother I believe had to explain there's going to be a little temple built according to 0 42 44 there's dimension to feel we're going to read a little bit later on but as if you're 40 44 skills the dimension now one we've got set down right dimensions and tell you how to build it come on tell them the time of night you know hey you need to be able to travel this soap hi and have so many pillars and like you said have so many great things over that all meant something doctors didn't say how you always throw a couple of sticks together put ten up you know throw the ark in there no he told them exactly how to do it and you know what they did it as close as they could do it they did it what's the same thing with the Millennium temple that thing's going to be built according to Ezekiel 42 44 all right so we gotta get is sister Regina said you know back over here work off so all this is going to happen after we leave that's why I believe that brother branham when he preached down 70 weeks he didn't preach it in depth anymore because it's not to us he hits it in day of 70 weeks he hits it in certain other places but this is not this the happenings between here if you're still here you're in another group you're in another group you're not bright you never will be bribed you're not going to come up and be right over here you either that's my brother promises you're you're you're here what you're going to be back that's right if you don't have the new work here you know gonna have it there now you can be given eternal life an impartation to be kind of line but you will not have it as a possession so you're going to have to stand over here to wipe your judgment and be judged by your work that's what revelation says in Revelations 20 or 21 it says when the books were opened they were judged by their works that's right I don't want standing I don't stand about my work the deeds done in the body is the wrong we do that somewhere in here but you know what if I get more flying body here and I'm change if I die and go by the grave even some of y'all have to get me up out of the ground ain't going worry about that I really not that's but but it's real simple to realize the Bible says some men's sins go before them some follow so what happens is is you sense in a sense they can stand against Bob that goes before God it's recorded not a sin of both yeah are not a sin of god forbid let's just you just as this horrible example I started running around with your wife you asked you to forgive me you said i forgiven i said i'm not a Christian if I did that I really don't think so not in this town now I might have happened before now run around maybe some people back during his time that right around on each other and he told them he one of them you know they got back together and he said they were real Christian but you don't know what happened in between all that time he not a lot not have been wondering the time all right so say it see that's not what oh man I'm talking my something I say against Bob that hurts our feelings are our or you know even you can say something bad about it and then I go on we'll see that sin though if I say come back say buh i said something up honestly forgive me and I said orden about to cry look at the power of forgiveness though now they Bob forgive me or did the Holy Ghost forgive me the Holy Ghost forgave me Bob as a human the filter forgave me it don't go before now if I don't it follows me they got it now if I don't if I if I just say wow he really is what I see convince myself you know the rotten scoundrel I'll teach Danny anyway but well that's great I'm bride now this is not in my soul this is in my humanity in ladder memory reason conscious of face imagination there's still the devil's playground so if i say Bob forgive me that goes up against the blood goes through the blood never to be saying again now if I retain that and I go by the grave or if I die in or with the new verb or even if I like a body chain which I don't know that you can do that if you got all that later Oh Avery baby gramps it won't be a few take buddy chain anyway so I go by the grave and I come up glorified body but I still that sin has got to go before God because we didn't take care of it here device that's why that scripture says some men go before in other words pepper and some power because it's following you it's going with you and when you go not to a white grumble we get out to heaven then you know what's going to be revealed about then I had that problem with it and then we're going to make it right okay this is what i don't understand let me give you this this is I don't understand that after we get a glorified body and we go to the marriage supper the Bible says that Jesus will come around and wipe the tears from our eyes right I don't are we going to be able to cry in heaven I don't know I don't know what lesson that transition area or potential what the Bible says about said you wanted here for my eyes say entry into the gyorko that's us selling to mention epicurious may be joyous tears no Canadian to the joy when you had that problem with somebody you go to him and you ask for forgiveness and you truly want forgiveness you do but he doesn't forgive you you know what that does the Bible says that heaps on to him and he's got to carry you you that's correct it yes it's not it's really not a two-way street he doesn't have to forgive you right but what happens the Bible says remember forgive and if you're not if you can't forgive whatever baby is is going to be heaped on you so if he don't forgive you then every bit of that I mean you're just relieved is you can be but that thing's going to be on him and he's going to have to watch but it's going to follow him to a judgment of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad not all right so now you gotta deal with it ok I am main man see what I mean you know so we just get this thing cleared out but that's what that's what we're worth looking here when we go up in a rapture we're done the Gentiles are finished there's no more Gentile save what i mean by saved is there's no more Gentile gonna go to receive the new birth come but no okay because you are truly you are saved if you're just five sanctified and you really try to see you know what it goes back to one thing God knows you are God the only one who knows if you really want to be justified or if you really want to be sanctified and there's some people out there that are trying to find truth in the denominational world and it can claim when a whose fault is that mess the Bible says is you won't go in talks about the preachers you won't go in and you won't let you people go in so they're stopped some preachers preachers stop them from going on with God right yeah and that's why I was thinking just few minutes ago and when we say tying up of loose ends because the tree was asking me about a website that I went to that Kingdom son 777 we were sitting there watching the next House of the nightman de-momming and you think the guy red brother around seventy weeks of Daniel book to a point then he goes off we'll see that's when the Rope does this do you understand what I'm saying there's a rope of truth this is God's truth right here this is God's the line now what this man did man's idea comes the rope Lord Jesus Christ baptism father son Holy go good so that's what brother Brown said that that seventh church age messenger come back to what tie up the loose ends so he took what was dangling picked it up like this tied a knot in it pulling it tight and put it right back together so that's what we're looking at I said by divine inspiration and interpretation we have what this book says and like I was explaining it brother Joe green collects marking that tree they didn't help Deitrick he had truth hey he he preached this bearing people on the message you know what that wasn't the devil the devil can't creaks OH truth in pre some became result but Claire's Larkin did not have the divine inspiration and interpretation with a message behind it there's one of the contention and the message was is that that the clamp Larkin had all this revelation for brother Ram did he just copied it no he didn't copy it he studied it just like you and I stood just like I studied that guy just like a colony internet and I took all the loose ends that were dangling because most of them even that guy shows how these denominational minded if jesus is coming back at the end of the 70th week well he is but it all like they say that's a loose in brother brown show truly we're going out of here before you even deal for the Jews ok so that's a loose then that's tied up that I don't have to listen to that but now all the other stuff that he said I enjoyed it was really good swear I got some of them some of the things that we're going to piece together I think that's what it is in the end time I'm not making them down myself a brother Baylor anybody in this church but we will dig to try to find the things that like daddy says that people out in the message now daddy same two weeks buddy it's like a it's like a venereal disease i'm not kidding let's just make it that strong that they dont dont preach on it but if there's a question in the people's my brother and I remember many times he'd say a question in the people's mind we'll see if there's a question in your mind that's what the devil can just sit there and that's what's happening now the questions that people have harbored for years in this message that had it in her mind the devil's finally what about this were you worried about this and nobody's ever strained it out what's brother branham right or was he wrong with you this class Larkin had this truth before he did clamps Larkin had a piece of hay Schofield Schofield died before brother branham came home in the earth and he talked about the Alpha knee but he couldn't put it all together he talks about the Holy Ghost off my son of God talk my son of man be tops my name is the third person of the Trinity too so see you there that's when that rope though that's when the road gets cut so the property God comes with the anointing of alive what is Elijah he's a restoration ministry amen take the regional Elijah what'd he do when he got a full mount carmel and all them 400 prophets of bail they jumped up on the offer so much they flattened it the Bible says they just flattened the whole Walter first thing Elijah done he didn't start bless God this and start you know screaming no the Bible says he repaired the altar why he had to prepare that altar so God could come there's no way guys not does not gonna come unless there's an ultra better but when he built the altar what'd he do fire out of heaven comes down consumes everything even such a water out knocks the water will see a larger the alliant ministry is a restoration of ministry so yo brother branham would be the same way it's a restoration ministry that Clarence Larkin couldn't get it all together Scofield couldn't get it all together moody couldn't get it all together Calvin couldn't get it all together because Calvin had truth but I'm dead Calvin did have three basic Calvin was a rascal why because he went way over on this side of predestination and then the other ones go way over on this side remember the vision brother Graham said I took a branch from this one not saying the tree was false took a branch from this one and a branch from this one stuck him in the ground and became a great tree what he was doing a restoration ministry so that's what brother Ram you gotta know one thing for sure he is doing a restoration ministry but he is gone you show do you mean you're tying up the prophets listening no I'm explaining to you how that man has done it again people in this message have have cut the rope again we just trying to get the Rope back together as much as we can't brother I was just going to say that that I'm sure when it Elijah was restored that the two officer you have to grab some of the pieces that were already there too and everything exactly he didn't take the different set of rock you know he took the rock that the revelation was built on but who beat it down the 400 false prophets beat the original beat the original altar down Elijah reaches over and gets this one and puts a ride backwards supposed to go he reaches and get additional father son Holy Ghost baptisms not right puts it right here one God not of Trinity puts you right back Daniel seventy weeks it's not going to be huge is coming at the end of the 70th week he's coming they won't come out there is restarting back who else can you say that Daniel 70 weeks is to the chills just reading scores yes watch the swipe the first lecture talks a third pull the third pole is what to the church to the bride and totally lost was to three different sense of people Dinah seventy weeks to me shows me retention my Redemption and what God is doing to me but you know what he's doing he's doing it to me here right he's going to do it to them here right alright so take this right here and just bring it back every Sunday now there was a brother that he got brother Benton's number I need it he texted me to come free for him next Sunday and then I'm going to be in Dutch Scott's the next Sunday but he never texted me back so get with me on that but if not i'll be here next Sunday if not something I will brother Joe time's up to be up so take this dough and keep this with you or either stocking right over here and leave it because what we're going to do is we're going to start filling it in you should have already filled in some of it but just don't get ahead let's let the Bible from now on look let's let the Bible in the prophets message a little bit of this in force and we're going to sweep from here we're going to sweep from here over to here alright so next week we'll start with the 1260 day prophecy of revelations that we never got to oh you gotta that was never a little bit scattered but no go on
