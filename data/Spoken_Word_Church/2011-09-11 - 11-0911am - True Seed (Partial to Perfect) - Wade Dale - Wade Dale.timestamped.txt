[22:52] celebrated the resurrection right Jesus
[22:55] Christ which is so important but he's
[22:58] forgotten but they still think
[23:01] of a little matter that destroyed a few
[23:04] people's life when one man died in our
[23:07] life could be saved but today they're
[23:11] not even thinking about him

[31:34] their shaking hands and didn't know
[31:36] y'all were singing
[31:39] good to be in the house of the Lord good
[31:41] to see each and every one of you here
[31:43] some of the sheep are here some have
[31:45] scattered
[31:46] usually when the pastor leaves a lot of
[31:48] others decide to take a vacation on that
[31:50] weekend but that's okay
[31:53] that's never bothered me
[31:56] because I'm where I'm supposed to be
[31:57] amen so same with you
[32:00] where you are is where you're supposed
[32:02] to be before the foundation of the world
[32:05] I knew you'd be here

[32:13] good to see brother Chris up here
[32:14] playing the guitar amen
[32:18] just a wonderful time to be alive
[32:21] blessing to be here and brother Donnie
[32:24] if I'm nod
[32:25] see if you can turn that thing up it's a
[32:27] little warm
[32:28] or down I mean it's a little warm up
[32:30] here it's just a gallon I have to wear a
[32:32] sweater okay all right
[32:36] Mr Gail our thermometer
[32:41] and it's always on cold
[32:43] the everybody will turn to First
[32:45] Corinthians 13 we're going to kind of
[32:47] continue our thought
[32:49] with uh the true seed but we're going to
[32:51] look at partial to perfect this morning
[32:55] and then this afternoon I promised them
[32:57] down in the Sunday school class I had a
[32:59] question or two about about former and
[33:01] latter rain but we need to understand
[33:03] partial to perfect before we can
[33:07] understand former and a lot of rain
[33:09] all right because foreign lettering can
[33:11] be very confusing you're going to see
[33:12] this afternoon the profit starts out
[33:15] in a partial understanding of the former
[33:18] lettering and then he goes to a perfect
[33:20] understanding of a foreign letter range
[33:22] because Luther went to a partial
[33:23] understanding of the baptism uh he
[33:27] continued with father son Holy Ghost now
[33:29] that wasn't the perfect will of God that
[33:31] was permission will of God our partial
[33:33] will have done letting that happen
[33:35] allowing it to go on but remember one
[33:38] thing's for sure
[33:39] we got to come to Perfect Right perfect
[33:43] is what we got to come to and I want you
[33:45] to keep this in your mind look at the
[33:47] church ages
[33:49] we don't have them up here anymore look
[33:50] at the church ages
[33:52] there's no more little round balls I
[33:55] have to lay out of the set
[33:56] in other words there's no other Church
[33:58] aides left
[33:59] so as we read these scriptures today and
[34:02] as we read the scripture this afternoon
[34:04] remember one thing's for sure there's
[34:07] nothing nothing going to carry over into
[34:11] another age we're either going to fall
[34:14] or we're either going to be harvested
[34:16] and taken up or harvested and put into
[34:19] what the fire remember they come through
[34:21] and the Harvest they come through they
[34:23] harvest everything the the weeds go into
[34:26] the into the fire the wheat goes to the
[34:29] chafing floor and they go up and the
[34:33] weeds go down all right there's no other
[34:35] we can't Pitchfork this back to another
[34:38] age we either got to come to perfect
[34:40] realization or just like I was speaking
[34:43] of brother Mike ultes last Sunday and I
[34:46] didn't know this about a brother that
[34:47] had come in I was walking out like I
[34:50] start I'm starting to do now and I was
[34:53] back there real close to him and I said
[34:54] you're either of God or you're of the
[34:56] devil one of the two and he got them
[34:57] walked out so
[35:00] they went out from us because there
[35:02] wasn't of us
[35:03] but come to find out that he'd been
[35:05] having a lot of trouble he was he was um
[35:08] a little unstable and caused a lot of
[35:10] trouble in the church and brother Mike
[35:12] actually kind of thanked me for
[35:14] helping him on out the door so I've done
[35:17] that before but you know what that
[35:19] wasn't me that was God because I had no
[35:22] clue who this person was no I did not
[35:24] know the background I did not know
[35:26] anything that was going on so you can
[35:28] count that as my ignorance or is God
[35:30] doing it one of the two so First
[35:32] Corinthians 13.
[35:35] we could read the whole chapter here but
[35:37] let's just read verse 6 through 13. and
[35:40] let's bow our heads before we continue
[35:41] dear heavenly father we pray Lord this
[35:44] morning that you would one more time
[35:45] come by Lord and use us in a special way
[35:48] it should not be Lord one that stands by
[35:50] the wayside but Lord you'd be one that
[35:52] would be an active participant in the
[35:53] service you would take over lord in
[35:56] every mind and heart of every believer
[35:58] sitting here Lord would something would
[36:00] quicken in their life Lord the word that
[36:03] they hold on to Lord may it Quicken Lord
[36:05] May the ones that don't have life Lord
[36:07] may they realize that they need you
[36:09] father that this is a desperate time
[36:12] that there's no other no other age or no
[36:14] other characteristic of you that's left
[36:17] except for the going up of the Bride
[36:18] father we pray that you'd just be with
[36:21] the ones that are not here be with Dad
[36:22] as he ministers for Brother Richard just
[36:24] bless him keep him strong thank you for
[36:26] healing his body Lord now touch his
[36:28] throat that it'll be healed completely
[36:30] and you'll have no problems at all
[36:33] Lauren we pray now that you'd be with a
[36:35] missionary on a Foreign Fields just
[36:36] bless them Lord take care of them give
[36:38] them Lord's souls for their endeavor
[36:40] Lord you also said you sent the word and
[36:42] healed the people so if there'd be
[36:44] anyone here among us today the sick or
[36:46] needy father we pray that you heal them
[36:48] now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ may
[36:51] all sin and sickness be done away Lord
[36:53] that you can come in have preeminence
[36:54] total preeminence not just partial Lord
[36:57] but total perfect preeminence in this
[36:59] service father forgive us of our sins
[37:01] and Lord though we be a Castaway may you
[37:03] help these people Lord that you may give
[37:05] them light Lord that you may bless them
[37:08] Father and give them strength
[37:10] they're the ones that's not with us
[37:11] today Lord just take care of them
[37:13] wherever they may be
[37:14] lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit
[37:16] in Jesus name we pray amen Lord
[37:20] much going to be a good service because
[37:22] we got up this morning we're getting
[37:23] ready to come to work come to work get
[37:25] ready to come to work
[37:27] and uh I went to the eye doctor and he
[37:29] gave me contacts and I either got the
[37:31] left and the right or the right and the
[37:32] left took me 20 minutes to get it in
[37:34] then I look cross-eyed so I had to take
[37:36] them out so now I got my glasses back on
[37:39] again so uh and then I told brother Joe
[37:42] I'd write my scripture backwards I wrote
[37:43] first Corinthians 16 verse 13 and it's
[37:46] First Corinthians 13 verse 6. to 13. so
[37:50] forgive me of my ignorance but uh and we
[37:54] were supposed to be here at 8 30 this
[37:56] morning to turn on everything and we got
[37:58] here after Terrence Alicia did so
[38:00] um it was not June's fault it was mine
[38:04] because I couldn't get those stupid
[38:05] contacts in mind
[38:06] but anyway just pray for us because you
[38:08] know wearing these glasses I have to
[38:10] have them for here but but from about
[38:12] brother aisle backwards y'all could be
[38:14] all gone and not know it it's just it's
[38:16] just fuzzy next one I go down the aisle
[38:18] now so I can see where you're asleep or
[38:20] not so if you're going to sleep be about
[38:22] from brother out back and I'll never
[38:24] know the difference until I start
[38:26] walking down the aisle again so but you
[38:28] just pray for me I I'd like to have
[38:30] contacts I don't like these classes but
[38:32] the contacts are a multi-focused contact
[38:35] so you can see out there and you can
[38:37] also sit here so they made them almost
[38:38] like bifocals now but but if you get the
[38:40] wrong one in the wrong eye
[38:44] or get them backwards I know a lot of
[38:46] you wear contacts you get them in
[38:48] backwards man it's like somebody with a
[38:49] needle sticking in your eye so I did
[38:51] that I got one in I got number right
[38:53] number my Right One In
[38:54] this morning popped in just like that
[38:57] it was backwards all right take it back
[39:00] out so anyway so First Corinthians let's
[39:02] have a little a little humor this
[39:04] morning and on my part
[39:06] First Corinthians 13.
[39:08] verse 6.
[39:10] Rejoice not an iniquity but rejoices in
[39:13] the truth
[39:16] beareth all things believe us all things
[39:20] hope is all things endureth
[39:24] see that th on the end of that that's
[39:26] ongoing you're not just going to believe
[39:28] one thing
[39:29] you're not going to just hope in one
[39:31] thing you're going to keep hoping you're
[39:32] going to keep believing you're going to
[39:34] keep enduring
[39:35] charity never failing but whether there
[39:38] be prophecies they shall fail
[39:41] we've had prophecy since the beginning
[39:43] of time right right so we're narrowing
[39:46] it down to the end time all right now we
[39:49] don't know the difference between the
[39:50] prophesying of the right or they used to
[39:52] not know the difference between the
[39:53] prophesy and the right left the only
[39:54] time you'll know it now is if you have
[39:56] the Holy Ghost all right
[39:58] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[40:01] they shall cease
[40:03] whether there be knowledge it shall
[40:05] vanish away
[40:08] now Paul listen for we know in part in
[40:10] other words we know part
[40:12] we know in part
[40:15] and we prophesy in part
[40:18] which Paul did
[40:20] but when that which is perfect is come
[40:24] it had not showed up yet or he wouldn't
[40:26] have written that right but that which
[40:29] is perfect is come
[40:31] then that which is in part shall be done
[40:34] away now not thrown away because listen
[40:36] not thrown away and and and and and
[40:39] denying it or or letting it be just
[40:42] something that would throw in a trash
[40:44] can no it's a building block because
[40:46] look when I was a child he didn't deny
[40:49] he was a child
[40:50] when I was a child I spoke to the child
[40:53] he knew what he did when he was a child
[40:55] I understood as a child I thought as a
[40:58] child but when I became a man I put away
[41:01] childish things
[41:02] for now we see through a glass darkling
[41:06] but then when
[41:09] I put away childish things
[41:11] that's what he said that's his whole
[41:13] thought but when I became a man I put
[41:15] away childish things for now we see
[41:17] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[41:19] face what when we put the childish
[41:21] things away we're going to be able to
[41:22] see face to face now this is the end
[41:24] time now I know in part
[41:26] but then shall I know even as I am known
[41:30] and now I'll buy the faith hope and
[41:32] charity
[41:33] these three but the greatest of these
[41:35] is Charity or The Headstone you may be
[41:37] seated in the Lord has blessings of the
[41:39] reading of the word like I said we're
[41:41] going to speak continue with
[41:43] the true seed
[41:46] not as true as in false we know there's
[41:49] false seed we know there's false
[41:52] Doctrine even in the message
[41:56] but we're going to come upon a statement
[41:58] where brother Ryan says out of the true
[41:59] sea
[42:01] will come a group
[42:02] not saying that that seed is not false
[42:05] because we're going to read some quotes
[42:07] here in just a little while
[42:09] let's do number one while we're at it
[42:11] that brother Bob if anything goes wrong
[42:13] today it's about the phone
[42:18] Bob black
[42:19] brother Bob black
[42:21] brother Bob black it'll be his fault
[42:26] s about he is the true witness we're
[42:27] going to read it in just a little while
[42:28] in Revelation 3 7. on ourselves now this
[42:31] word true is the same
[42:33] Revelation 3 7. you'll call it it does
[42:34] not mean true as in contrast was false
[42:37] it has a richer deeper meaning by far
[42:40] because remember Jesus he's talking
[42:42] about the faithful and true witness in
[42:44] the Legacy and church age and
[42:45] Revelations 3 14 he's saying not he was
[42:49] a false witness but it says the faithful
[42:51] and true witness all right the beginning
[42:53] of the creation of God and you and I are
[42:56] supposed to be the continuation of that
[42:58] creation it has a rich or deep remaining
[43:00] by far it expresses perfect realization
[43:03] and contrast to partial realization now
[43:06] back in the Philadelphia Nations come in
[43:08] the glory was drawing now what great
[43:09] love that age manifested for him then he
[43:14] talks about in First Peter 1 8 but look
[43:16] at the bottom partial realization will
[43:18] be made
[43:19] perfect
[43:20] realization complete realization
[43:23] Hallelujah we have been looking through
[43:25] a glass Darkly but soon it will be face
[43:27] to face we have been down from glory to
[43:29] glory not doing away with any of this I
[43:32] want you to realize one thing let's not
[43:33] do away with anything that's in the past
[43:35] because without because what Paul was
[43:38] saying he said when I was a child I
[43:39] spayed to the child in other words he
[43:41] remembers what he'd done right so he
[43:43] didn't he didn't say it that never
[43:45] happened no he just put that away
[43:48] he put that part of his life away and he
[43:50] built on that and that's what you and I
[43:52] I think some of us may be stuck in our
[43:54] journey
[43:55] but let's realize one thing but soon it
[43:59] will be right in the glory so we may be
[44:02] coming to church every Sunday from glory
[44:03] to glory from Sunday to Sunday
[44:06] but there's going to come a time like
[44:07] brother collie was talking this morning
[44:09] which was wonderful all these people are
[44:12] are giving this great Memorial to 9-1-1
[44:14] which which we should
[44:16] I mean it wasn't those people's fault it
[44:18] was an awful uh you know it was a
[44:21] horrible tragedy
[44:23] but you know what
[44:25] we can't deny what the prophet said
[44:27] either America will pay for her
[44:31] rejecting the word of God Amen all right
[44:35] so America's going to pay for the
[44:36] rejection of the word of God how are we
[44:38] paying for it well that was part of it
[44:40] all right but that's but see that's only
[44:42] partial that's the only partial
[44:45] tribulation 9-1-1 was just a toothache
[44:48] compared to what's going to happen when
[44:49] we get out of here right so just
[44:51] remember that if that was horrible guess
[44:53] what's coming okay all right so I didn't
[44:56] say this and I'm not condemning America
[44:58] the prophet of God did and the word of
[45:00] God did so there's nothing we can do
[45:02] about it that's why I don't pray for
[45:03] America I don't pray for the leaders I I
[45:06] just pray to get me out of here because
[45:08] they're not going to do anything for me
[45:11] me out of here I'm not worried about
[45:13] what's going on in this world all right
[45:15] because one day you're going to realize
[45:16] one thing's for sure like brother random
[45:19] said he said you keep your home you're
[45:20] going to take the mark of the beast now
[45:21] I didn't say that he did right he said
[45:23] you keep your home
[45:25] you will take the mark of the beast
[45:28] that don't mean for us to sell our home
[45:30] start living in cardboard boxes
[45:33] no but when it comes let's don't go
[45:38] we've been told
[45:39] talk to me about today all that partial
[45:42] realization was in the past Luther had
[45:44] partial realization
[45:45] we actually have partial realization
[45:47] Paul Paul even prophesied himself that
[45:50] he had partial realization is that what
[45:51] he said he said I sleep through a glass
[45:53] darkling
[45:54] but soon face to face
[45:56] but well he didn't see face to face you
[45:59] and I are the ones that are going to see
[46:00] face to face right we're going to see it
[46:02] we're going to read the quote in a
[46:03] little while where brother round said
[46:05] Moses
[46:07] was partial realization
[46:10] David was partial realization man right
[46:14] those are great people
[46:17] but we're going to read that a little
[46:18] while in Hebrews 11.
[46:20] where all those people
[46:22] are waiting on me and you to come to
[46:25] Perfection to get them out of the ground
[46:28] all right look what's been bestowed upon
[46:30] us but we've gone from glory to glory
[46:33] but soon it will be right in the glory
[46:34] and in his glory we'll shine we shall be
[46:37] like him wonderfully like him Jesus our
[46:39] savior Divine isn't that wonderful we
[46:41] are completing him that is true he would
[46:44] not lie to us about that but one day we
[46:46] will be changed in the atoms we will put
[46:48] on immortality we'll be all swallowed up
[46:50] in life then we will realize
[46:54] realization
[46:56] so we're not gonna realize realization
[46:58] until we're changed in its entirety
[47:02] because we're going to see a little bit
[47:03] later on how that even you today when
[47:06] you come to church today you come as
[47:09] partial and perfect
[47:10] if you're born again if you're born
[47:13] again you come as partial and perfect
[47:14] you say how'd that happen
[47:16] you're a human
[47:18] amen that's partial but if you're born
[47:21] again that's perfect amen so you came
[47:24] not as two separate people not as not as
[47:27] some schizophrenic
[47:29] but you come as partial
[47:31] what's coming
[47:34] oh okay you knew I was preaching today
[47:41] see you I was preaching today so we get
[47:43] back in the back
[47:46] but we were realized realization you say
[47:50] well boy this is pretty real now what's
[47:51] President been trying to tell us
[47:53] this is not real
[47:56] the real you is the one I can't see
[47:59] that's the real you that's the one I
[48:02] want to talk to today I see this guy
[48:04] work a lot we live among our people
[48:06] right and the congregation we pretty
[48:09] much know everybody's life and what goes
[48:13] on because if you'll shut up long enough
[48:14] most people will tell you
[48:17] then we were realized realization
[48:20] excuse me brother Joe if you'll pull up
[48:23] sorry
[48:24] for the bottom number two please
[48:27] all right this is the Greek Lexicon this
[48:29] is where we get the word true
[48:32] it's all athenos
[48:34] are that which is not only the name and
[48:37] resemblance but the real nature
[48:40] corresponding to the name
[48:45] my name is Wade Dale I got a nature I
[48:48] got a partial
[48:51] but that's not my perfect nature
[48:55] because you see mine
[48:57] you see my partial nature but somewhere
[49:00] inside there's one that corresponding to
[49:03] the name in every respect now Luther not
[49:08] brother gay not in every respect Luther
[49:09] didn't correspond to the name
[49:12] because you baptized father son Holy
[49:13] Ghost right right see they didn't
[49:15] connect with the name but see when it
[49:17] comes from loose to actually the
[49:18] Pentecost
[49:23] to the idea signified by the name real
[49:27] true and genuine
[49:30] now not to say that Luther wasn't
[49:33] genuine but Luther was genuine in a
[49:36] partial sense
[49:37] Luther was the two shoots remember the
[49:39] two as brother Brown uh talked about the
[49:42] bride tree and read restoration of the
[49:44] Bride tree you got two shoots come up
[49:46] tell you what
[49:49] let's just stop for just a second
[49:51] yesterday I went over to the hunting
[49:53] club and uh
[49:55] tore up all the food plots and got it
[49:57] ready so that's kind of where I do my
[49:59] preaching you remember I used to preach
[50:00] to the lawnmower out here but jokes
[50:01] doesn't know some uh cutting the grass
[50:04] now but I used to preach all my good
[50:05] sermons to the lawnmower you just got
[50:06] the other ones
[50:08] so I was over there preaching to my
[50:10] tractor and uh
[50:12] thinking about things and I thought you
[50:14] know what I was going to talk about
[50:15] today
[50:16] and this evening the former loud rain
[50:19] too
[50:19] you know it doesn't matter it can rain
[50:22] all day on concrete
[50:28] and nothing will ever come up right
[50:31] right
[50:32] it can rain on plastic
[50:35] it can rain on this church but does this
[50:37] church ever grow
[50:39] no
[50:40] no right I'm talking about physical rain
[50:43] let's go spiritual now that I'm talking
[50:44] about physical rain
[50:46] so I'm over there digging these food
[50:48] plots up and I'm like you know if I
[50:50] don't plant a seed
[50:52] in this fertile ground man it was all
[50:55] just moist enough and turned up real
[50:57] good and got it all good and level
[50:59] and I left
[51:01] but if nothing was ever planted
[51:05] nothing's ever going to come up
[51:07] doesn't matter if you have a foreign
[51:09] ladder rain we'll talk about it this
[51:10] afternoon where brother Brown was really
[51:12] getting onto the latter rain people
[51:14] because they thought they had the latter
[51:15] rain and that was it
[51:17] but it wasn't
[51:19] they weren't really even in the form of
[51:21] rain because the former rain is the
[51:22] teaching rain all right but that's the
[51:26] same thing with true true as in the idea
[51:29] of signifying by the name real true and
[51:31] genuine if there's a real true genuine
[51:34] seed planted in that ground that thing
[51:36] when it rains on it former our latter is
[51:39] going to come up
[51:40] and we're going to also read that the
[51:42] rain falls on the just and the unjust so
[51:45] you know if I leave those food plots
[51:46] along over there there's going to be
[51:48] some weed seed grow up of its own but
[51:51] it's gonna it's going to Rejoice over
[51:52] the same rain
[51:54] but now people we got to get that thing
[51:56] separate
[51:57] you try brother Donnie downstairs
[51:59] talking about Believers May Believers
[52:01] and unbelievers you didn't know I've
[52:02] done it did
[52:03] um
[52:06] we'll have a searching around for some
[52:07] kids let me tell you something else
[52:09] you people that have
[52:11] children I don't care if they're 20
[52:13] years old
[52:14] I don't want to see them running around
[52:15] walking around the parking lot during
[52:16] any part of the service
[52:19] and the old brother Dale will back me up
[52:20] 100 percent
[52:22] but I've done caught two or three or
[52:23] four walking around in the parking lot
[52:25] rambling around talking on their cell
[52:27] phones in the in the car now that's not
[52:30] respectful to the word of God
[52:32] that's not respectful to this church
[52:34] at 10 o'clock on Sunday school class is
[52:37] starting at 10 o'clock the services
[52:38] started
[52:40] now if you don't care anymore about your
[52:41] kids than that
[52:42] then you need to be in the altar today
[52:45] I don't care how old they are
[52:47] another Wednesday night I had to run two
[52:50] supposedly adult
[52:51] teenagers
[52:53] out of the break room downstairs or the
[52:56] things that I mean downstairs they were
[52:57] just Milling around
[52:59] a lot of service was going on so
[53:02] I don't care how old they are
[53:05] if I did that I want somebody to tell me
[53:10] because it's a soul that study you're
[53:12] responsible for them father's your
[53:15] response you know you're responsible for
[53:16] your daughter until your daughter
[53:18] marries a man right you heart brother
[53:20] Brown you are her Holy Ghost
[53:23] that's right you're the one that's
[53:25] supposed to keep her or him that's right
[53:31] I know my kid one of them comes here but
[53:33] the other one doesn't
[53:34] but when they were here they didn't roam
[53:36] around the yard while we were having
[53:38] service amen I don't care if they're 30
[53:40] years old right
[53:42] we shouldn't be doing that right we come
[53:45] to a service to the house of God we come
[53:47] to be reverent
[53:48] you say cause trouble
[53:52] that's for you to discern
[53:55] because you know what it upsets me
[53:58] and it upsets me from trying to get a
[54:00] sermon when I have to walk downstairs
[54:01] and find some kids walking around and
[54:04] adults are setting up here setting
[54:05] Sunday school class or whatever so you
[54:07] need to talk to your talk to your family
[54:10] have a family discussion
[54:12] okay amen everything okay all right
[54:19] it's time to quit playing we gotta get
[54:20] out of here if you don't want your kids
[54:22] to go with you you're sorry individual
[54:25] I want my kids to go I give my own
[54:28] personal life to see my children saved
[54:30] before the Holy Ghost right now right
[54:32] now I will
[54:37] I'd love to give them what I've got
[54:40] but I can't I can only get them close
[54:43] enough to the Fountain so that that rain
[54:45] can fall on them and let and let them be
[54:48] watered by it let them see the life
[54:52] come on people but you gotta realize one
[54:54] thing
[54:55] realize them like Abraham did they're
[54:59] sitting right here right they're not out
[55:01] there in the world that's the journey
[55:03] when Dad was up here preaching and I was
[55:05] out in the world of sin did you think he
[55:06] worried about that no he just laughed
[55:08] and said no there'll be a time
[55:11] because he physically saw me sitting in
[55:13] a seat
[55:16] amen same way with your children
[55:19] moms dad husband wife whatever
[55:24] like your sister Brando
[55:26] she got desperate that's our problem
[55:29] we're just not desperate enough you know
[55:31] what we're not desperate because you
[55:33] know what we're doing
[55:35] when we bring all this together as in
[55:37] true as in as in we're trying to get
[55:40] something to the people he's saying well
[55:42] they did it in that age they did it you
[55:45] know we keep pitchforking
[55:47] this age has never been before right
[55:49] amen we've never had we've never come to
[55:51] this spot right all right we've never
[55:54] come to this spot
[55:56] right
[55:58] to take a body change so we've got to be
[56:00] different not be weird
[56:04] not being weird but be different
[56:08] right you know uh Jen's father's
[56:11] girlfriends
[56:13] last Saturday she came up to me and she
[56:16] said
[56:16] you know she said
[56:18] thank you for your stand now she drains
[56:21] and she you know does but she said thank
[56:23] you she said you're a living example
[56:28] see we could close and go home now I've
[56:30] done my job
[56:32] if you can realize that I never had to
[56:34] preach another sermon if you realize
[56:35] that this guy right here is trying to
[56:37] get us out of here and I said us I
[56:39] didn't say to me sure I'm worried about
[56:40] me
[56:41] but I'd go to every one of you make it
[56:44] than me and I'm honest
[56:48] my kids make it and you're not even pay
[56:51] me a bit of attention from now on just
[56:53] bring my kids in and give them what I
[56:56] think I say if that's what it is
[56:59] I mean I've been sitting here for 12
[57:02] years
[57:04] watching and waiting for my kids to come
[57:08] Abraham waited 25 years and he got older
[57:11] and it was so more and more impossible
[57:15] see I'm not trying to birth children but
[57:17] yet I'm trying to get somebody the new
[57:19] birth all right which is much more
[57:21] important than a physical birth but now
[57:24] as we get them in as babies
[57:27] they've got to grow right they got them
[57:29] a tour that's what we're talking about
[57:30] today when you're born again you start
[57:32] as a partial realization you realize
[57:35] something different
[57:37] you realize and Paul even Paul being a
[57:40] prophet he realized that he was
[57:43] impartial realization but that which is
[57:46] perfect has come
[57:47] languages in part will be done away with
[57:50] not done away as in you're not going to
[57:51] take everything you know and throw it
[57:53] out no it's a building block to what's
[57:56] coming next
[57:57] all right that is already told you about
[57:59] former lab rain but we're going to kind
[58:01] of break it down this afternoon
[58:03] but look here and see this
[58:05] let's go to number two a
[58:10] listen to what the prophet has to say
[58:12] about
[58:15] Philadelphia Church age
[58:18] now he's talking this one he's talking
[58:20] about Revelations 3 7. since this word
[58:23] indeed expresses perfect realization
[58:25] he's talking about the truth
[58:26] that's against the idea of partial
[58:28] realization as Illustrated in these
[58:30] verses we can Now understand
[58:34] as never before
[58:36] Listen to What a prophet says as never
[58:38] before we should be understanding this
[58:42] we can Now understand it never before
[58:44] anti-top contracted with type and
[58:47] substance with Shadow take the example
[58:50] now of Manna From Heaven now what was
[58:52] Mana partial realization Mana would fall
[58:56] if you hold it over another day it would
[58:59] rot correct right now when they win and
[59:02] ate the old corn of the land what was
[59:03] that type of perfect realization
[59:06] all right because it was the actual
[59:09] colonel
[59:10] right what man of the man of ceased
[59:14] when they got into the promised land and
[59:16] then they started eating of the old corn
[59:18] of the land which was what
[59:20] matured
[59:23] corn plant
[59:25] it wasn't Luther with two stalks
[59:27] sticking up like I said before you don't
[59:29] go out there and you know and plant my
[59:30] food plots we spend hundreds of dollars
[59:32] and we start seeing it all come up
[59:33] brother Colleen and we go out there and
[59:35] spray it with Roundup or or go out there
[59:38] and say man I got it right here's corn
[59:40] this is corn no it's not corn amen
[59:42] partially it's corn right
[59:44] it's a shadow
[59:47] because down underneath that soil was
[59:49] the original seed
[59:51] right that Original Seed had to break
[59:54] moisture break open two shoes but that
[59:58] was partial to understanding Luther had
[1:00:00] a partial understanding of the word of
[1:00:02] God
[1:00:02] but now look take the example now man
[1:00:05] from Heaven God sent down Angel bread
[1:00:07] now it was Angel bread
[1:00:09] it had every nutrient they needed in
[1:00:11] that little bitty wafer
[1:00:14] man so it's not false
[1:00:17] but it wasn't the true food that they
[1:00:19] should have lived on right everybody
[1:00:21] understand this I know some of the older
[1:00:22] ones we all heard this before but we got
[1:00:23] a lot of new people they need to come on
[1:00:25] up a little higher okay like me brother
[1:00:28] calling
[1:00:30] and Brother Don you're not right but
[1:00:33] that might affect them and sustain them
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:36] but why did it cease
[1:00:43] grow up babies
[1:00:45] grow up babies I'm not gonna feed you
[1:00:48] hand to mouth anymore
[1:00:50] you're gonna have to plant that corn
[1:00:52] seed now water it nurture it check the
[1:00:57] weeds out of it and when it grows guess
[1:01:00] what you'll have exactly what I'm going
[1:01:01] to give you which is a ear of corn
[1:01:04] and that's what they ate they ate the
[1:01:06] old corn of the land but he's not good
[1:01:08] for a day those who ate it were hungry
[1:01:10] again the next day
[1:01:12] now this is in this is in natural
[1:01:14] settings
[1:01:17] if it was left around it became what
[1:01:19] contaminated but Jesus is the true bread
[1:01:21] from Heaven thereof Mana was just a type
[1:01:25] and if any man eats a bat bread that
[1:01:27] came from Heaven he will never hunger
[1:01:29] again spiritually
[1:01:30] he does not need to come back and eat it
[1:01:32] again
[1:01:33] the moment he partook he had eternal
[1:01:35] life here indeed is reality no need any
[1:01:40] longer for a shadow no need for a
[1:01:42] partial salvation
[1:01:44] now
[1:01:45] that's where a lot of people in the
[1:01:46] message take it that Luther didn't have
[1:01:48] the Holy Ghost and Wesley didn't have
[1:01:50] the Holy Ghost because they were under
[1:01:52] reformation and that was partial now
[1:01:55] remember partial is still real partial
[1:01:59] is still of God all right
[1:02:05] Moses is partial and Jesus is perfect
[1:02:07] that didn't make Moses fault that's
[1:02:09] right that didn't make Moses have
[1:02:11] nothing Moses was almost he was close to
[1:02:14] God
[1:02:15] right he was guarding the people right
[1:02:17] Christ in Moses doing the work so guess
[1:02:20] what thought a lot of him he brought him
[1:02:22] back and let him tell Jesus what he was
[1:02:24] going to do with his second coming right
[1:02:26] all right so he thought a lot of Moses
[1:02:28] so Moses even and when we talk about
[1:02:30] getting into a little bit about partial
[1:02:31] don't think that that is degrading those
[1:02:33] people they were they were put in a
[1:02:36] position had to come up two stalks first
[1:02:39] right two little green shoots had to
[1:02:41] come out of the ground
[1:02:42] why
[1:02:44] should the rain could run down
[1:02:47] and start a stalk
[1:02:50] that make this fall no it's a true part
[1:02:53] of the plant
[1:02:55] but this had to grow that's right God
[1:02:57] didn't want it to stay like this two
[1:02:59] little green shoots right he didn't want
[1:03:01] it to stay there he don't want you at
[1:03:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[1:03:05] newborn baby he don't want you to stay
[1:03:06] as two little shoes because that's what
[1:03:07] happens to you in your birth you're a
[1:03:09] little baby
[1:03:11] and all when the wind blows and when
[1:03:13] somebody crushes you you know you say
[1:03:15] God pick me up welcome thing you know
[1:03:17] you go ahead and cut the grass grass
[1:03:18] grows you go out and step on the grass
[1:03:19] and it bends over guess what happens the
[1:03:21] next day that thing's right back up all
[1:03:24] right
[1:03:24] so you know it doesn't matter about all
[1:03:26] the things we go through Winds of
[1:03:28] darkness and all those things there's a
[1:03:30] shoot trying to come out
[1:03:32] there's a stalk because you can't put
[1:03:34] the corn on the end of this bug here you
[1:03:36] can't put the corn on the end of this
[1:03:38] too heavy won't work
[1:03:41] so you gotta have stock man guess what a
[1:03:45] little more rigid
[1:03:47] sanctification
[1:03:49] clean and set aside this guy for service
[1:03:51] stand up
[1:03:52] don't lay over like a baby
[1:03:54] stand up
[1:03:57] be a man
[1:03:59] because you know what as this
[1:04:01] remembering justification
[1:04:03] that's not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:05] so you can you can these two little
[1:04:08] shoots can look just like grass weeds
[1:04:11] um corn it can look like any kind of
[1:04:14] vegetable it can look like in hardly any
[1:04:15] kind of weed when it's right like this
[1:04:17] but when that thing starts to stop
[1:04:18] coming up you realize one thing it's not
[1:04:20] just grass right it's not just grass
[1:04:24] something happened to that plant it's
[1:04:27] growing
[1:04:28] up amen it's being more rigid it's able
[1:04:30] to stand on its own right of the roots
[1:04:33] are getting deeper
[1:04:35] that thing rocks a little bit guess what
[1:04:37] brother Brown said that just make
[1:04:39] loosens The Roots up so the thing to dig
[1:04:41] a little more so the Winds of Darkness
[1:04:43] don't worry about them they're gonna
[1:04:44] blow but guess what when that root gets
[1:04:47] a little bit deeper what's it heading
[1:04:48] toward it's heading toward the water
[1:04:51] it's trying to get to the waters trying
[1:04:53] to get the nutrients out of the ground
[1:04:55] so you've got this the second part which
[1:04:58] is the stock that comes up
[1:05:00] no corn on that
[1:05:03] got to have all these other things that
[1:05:04] come out gotta have that tassel
[1:05:06] what is the tassel do
[1:05:10] the tassel looks a little bit like it
[1:05:13] but it's forming more in the perfect
[1:05:16] because you watch your corn come up you
[1:05:18] watch the tassel come up to the top I'm
[1:05:19] talking about a regular piece of corn
[1:05:20] not just wheat now let's take corn
[1:05:24] but what happens is that gives off
[1:05:25] pollen that gives off
[1:05:27] um things that's coming out of the top
[1:05:30] don't they look like corn
[1:05:33] but then all of a sudden you see
[1:05:34] something coming out the side
[1:05:36] and it looks kind of like my hand
[1:05:39] looks like corn
[1:05:41] it's in baby form right
[1:05:44] that's why that we we realize that
[1:05:46] there's baby forms of our journey that
[1:05:49] we got to get out of if you stay like
[1:05:52] this and you're supposed to be a corn
[1:05:53] you sometimes happen you grow spin
[1:05:55] stunted you don't have enough water you
[1:05:57] haven't got to a fountain you hadn't
[1:05:58] gotten the roots deep enough all right
[1:06:02] but if you ever get that
[1:06:06] see that's partial salvation
[1:06:09] it wasn't that Luther didn't have
[1:06:10] salvation
[1:06:12] it was just part of God for that time
[1:06:14] which is partial that means part that's
[1:06:17] what partial really means it's part
[1:06:19] right all right let's part up partial
[1:06:23] not perfect we'll read it in just a
[1:06:25] minute we'll see what partial means and
[1:06:27] you'll get a real good meaning of this
[1:06:29] but don't pull it up yet
[1:06:32] no need for a partial salvation here is
[1:06:34] the whole of it just like Jesus isn't a
[1:06:36] part of God
[1:06:37] he is God Amen now
[1:06:41] this starts us on our journey our
[1:06:44] partial form right
[1:06:47] but now here's the perfect form now if
[1:06:50] she is him
[1:06:51] she the bride
[1:06:53] it's him
[1:06:55] that's what I was talking about this
[1:06:56] past weekend
[1:06:58] realize one thing folks
[1:07:01] I know there's mate Believers True
[1:07:02] Believers and unbelievers
[1:07:05] but there's really only two types of
[1:07:06] people
[1:07:07] that's Believers and unbelievers because
[1:07:10] you're either you're either not if
[1:07:13] you're of God or a part of God
[1:07:21] or if you even want to act like God
[1:07:23] you're the devil
[1:07:25] you're anti
[1:07:29] she works coming to
[1:07:31] man God winked it at Luther's ignorance
[1:07:34] he winked at Wesley's ignorance what the
[1:07:36] ignorance of there was not enough light
[1:07:38] shining on the word to be able to read
[1:07:40] and see that that the Revelation is not
[1:07:43] father son holy ghost that it's Lord
[1:07:45] Jesus Christ
[1:07:47] amen right right
[1:07:50] no eternal hell
[1:07:54] somebody told them we'll read it in a
[1:07:56] minute we'll see
[1:07:57] because Watch What Happens
[1:08:01] this
[1:08:02] can create a denomination
[1:08:04] this can't that's right that's where
[1:08:08] we're coming to in the service that's
[1:08:09] right because we are we are very close
[1:08:13] very close
[1:08:15] from being a denomination in this
[1:08:17] message or being of God
[1:08:21] Amen all right
[1:08:25] next one please
[1:08:32] either half the kid David he's still
[1:08:34] he's still going through the thought
[1:08:35] this beautiful phrase follows and comes
[1:08:37] out of the preceding phase he that is
[1:08:39] true if you want to read it we'll just
[1:08:41] save time we'll not read it Revelations
[1:08:43] 3 verse 7 he's talking about being
[1:08:46] he that is true and hath the Key of
[1:08:48] David Christ the perfect realization
[1:08:51] contrasted with partial realization here
[1:08:54] it is Moses was a prophet of God but
[1:08:58] Jesus likened to Moses was the prophet
[1:09:02] of God
[1:09:05] William Branham
[1:09:07] was not the prophet
[1:09:10] he was a prophet Amen brother Branham
[1:09:13] was partial
[1:09:15] this might hit you hard okay
[1:09:18] not gonna hit you but but
[1:09:21] he's dead
[1:09:24] he prophesied
[1:09:26] he died
[1:09:27] he had partial realization but he was so
[1:09:30] close to perfect realization what he
[1:09:33] said is going to change us so so the
[1:09:36] greatest Prophet That Ever Walked on the
[1:09:37] face of the Earth outside of the Prophet
[1:09:39] was William Brown No Doubt no doubt in
[1:09:43] my mind you can't talk me out of that
[1:09:45] why because he brought like brother dick
[1:09:48] said it doesn't matter what they say
[1:09:49] about that man
[1:09:53] he took me to an understanding of God
[1:09:56] that no one else has ever took him
[1:09:58] that's right same way with you and I
[1:10:00] right he took us to an understanding of
[1:10:02] God on well above
[1:10:05] anybody else even Moses because he took
[1:10:08] what Moses said and made it real to me
[1:10:10] and you he took what David said he took
[1:10:13] what Paul said and made it real to me
[1:10:16] and you all right
[1:10:18] David a man after God's Own Heart was
[1:10:20] king of Israel but Jesus is the greater
[1:10:22] David king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:10:24] God very God now David was born of the
[1:10:27] tribe of Judah out of whom no priest
[1:10:28] came yet he ate of the shoe bread
[1:10:29] reserved for the priest he was the great
[1:10:31] warrior overcoming the enemy
[1:10:32] establishing the people as king sat on
[1:10:34] the throne he was a prophet he was a
[1:10:36] wonderful type of Christ but he was a
[1:10:39] type of Christ
[1:10:41] he wasn't Christ
[1:10:43] now Christ within Moses doing the work
[1:10:45] but Moses was the type of Christ he was
[1:10:48] a Christ that's right all right now
[1:10:50] what's gonna what's the difference
[1:10:52] though in these people
[1:10:54] Moses David
[1:10:58] Hebrews 11 will tell you turn to Hebrews
[1:11:01] 11.
[1:11:05] I know this is simple but we're going to
[1:11:08] we're going to see something one of
[1:11:09] these days and it's going to strike our
[1:11:11] heart
[1:11:12] and we're going to realize why we're
[1:11:13] here
[1:11:16] Hebrews 11.
[1:11:19] we're not going to read it all but by
[1:11:21] faith all these people in this scripture
[1:11:24] it's not brother Joe don't worry about
[1:11:26] putting it up I just thought of this
[1:11:27] just now
[1:11:29] all those people in that scripture the
[1:11:31] very icons of faith we may call them the
[1:11:35] uh that's the that's the faith Hall of
[1:11:39] Fame
[1:11:41] and mind your name's not in it
[1:11:46] because we hadn't come yet right
[1:11:50] read all those names
[1:11:54] verse 38 of whom the world was not
[1:11:57] worthy for them even to be here
[1:12:02] they wandered in deserts mountains dens
[1:12:04] caves Earth and these all having
[1:12:06] obtained a partial
[1:12:09] report
[1:12:12] can we say that not change the word of
[1:12:14] God
[1:12:15] they they had a good report amen but it
[1:12:18] was a partial report
[1:12:22] why if it would have been a perfect one
[1:12:24] Paul wasn't a row what he wrote
[1:12:26] afterwards
[1:12:28] huh
[1:12:31] and these all having obtained a good
[1:12:33] report through faith received not the
[1:12:36] promise
[1:12:38] what is the promise
[1:12:40] the promise is unto you and to your
[1:12:42] children to them that are far off even
[1:12:44] as me as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:12:46] what Peter said
[1:12:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is your
[1:12:50] production I promise amen amen right
[1:12:52] that's right
[1:12:54] repeat I'm waiting to baptized name of
[1:12:56] Jesus Christ for a mission of sin and
[1:12:57] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:12:59] Ghost for this promise
[1:13:01] isn't to you to your children then to
[1:13:03] the far off your children
[1:13:06] there's another promise your children
[1:13:10] it's unbelievable that people can't
[1:13:12] believe for the children when the
[1:13:13] prophet said if you can't believe for
[1:13:15] your children I doubt you're even saved
[1:13:16] yourself that's right
[1:13:19] he's checking up time people
[1:13:24] harsher realization is okay
[1:13:28] listen to me look me in there partial
[1:13:30] realization is okay
[1:13:34] Paul said partial was okay
[1:13:37] but that which is perfect is come
[1:13:41] that which is in part will be done away
[1:13:45] let's finish reading it
[1:13:49] having obtained and these all having
[1:13:51] obtained a good report through faith
[1:13:52] received not the promise what the new
[1:13:54] birth they weren't born again
[1:13:57] God God
[1:14:01] Almighty having provided some better
[1:14:05] things for us
[1:14:07] that they who
[1:14:11] all those people and now as brother dick
[1:14:14] says and I agree 100 now you can put
[1:14:16] Paul and all the church ages all the
[1:14:19] church age Messengers including William
[1:14:20] Brown put them all in that group right
[1:14:23] because they're dead they can't do
[1:14:25] anything more on this Earth for me and
[1:14:27] you that's right all right
[1:14:30] God having provided some better things
[1:14:31] for us that they
[1:14:33] without us and I circled that in my
[1:14:36] Bible and wrote me
[1:14:38] that they without me should not be made
[1:14:41] perfect
[1:14:42] that's pers that's perfect realization
[1:14:46] they lived in partial
[1:14:49] we're supposed to be living in perfect
[1:14:51] realization
[1:14:53] as it's supposed to be
[1:14:56] all right so you kind of got to know
[1:14:57] where we're going now pull up number two
[1:14:59] B please
[1:15:03] I want you to look at this
[1:15:05] I just found it this morning this this
[1:15:07] morning actually
[1:15:12] praise Lord
[1:15:16] I want you to look at this partial
[1:15:23] first word
[1:15:26] that's what happened
[1:15:28] when you stay in person in partial
[1:15:30] realization you have doubt
[1:15:33] you have fear
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:37] Luther head doubt
[1:15:39] now listen let's get the human part out
[1:15:41] of the way we all got doubts in fear
[1:15:44] human
[1:15:49] but doubting the word of God
[1:15:53] should not be part of this perfect man
[1:15:57] now in the word of God should not be a
[1:15:59] part of the perfect man
[1:16:01] but look
[1:16:03] doubt
[1:16:06] judge
[1:16:08] but it also comes to discern
[1:16:13] contend waiver
[1:16:16] I guess that's miscellaneous
[1:16:19] to separate make a distinction
[1:16:21] discriminate
[1:16:23] to prefer
[1:16:27] I don't find a quote I don't know if I
[1:16:29] give it to brother Joe and then but
[1:16:30] brother Brown said partial realization
[1:16:31] creates a denomination
[1:16:36] and that's and then what that is
[1:16:38] separate make a distinction discriminate
[1:16:40] if you prefer to learn to learn by
[1:16:44] discrimination Luther learned what he
[1:16:46] learned from the Catholic Church
[1:16:48] right is that not right Luther learned
[1:16:51] what he learned from the Catholic Church
[1:16:52] we're going to read a quote this
[1:16:54] afternoon where brother Ram said Luther
[1:16:55] was the latter rain from the Catholic
[1:16:58] Church
[1:17:00] whoa
[1:17:02] but he come out as a reformer
[1:17:05] to try to reform the people
[1:17:08] and make them not born again if they
[1:17:10] accepted Luther's message and a message
[1:17:12] for their data suggest shall live by
[1:17:14] faith they were born again believers
[1:17:16] they had a group in that age that was
[1:17:17] born again does everybody understand
[1:17:19] that even though they were in
[1:17:21] denomination
[1:17:23] but really see remember Luther didn't
[1:17:25] create that denomination who did the
[1:17:28] people behind him the devil got into the
[1:17:30] people behind him when he died and
[1:17:33] couldn't couldn't protest anymore when
[1:17:34] he died and went away same thing with
[1:17:36] brother Brown I've always told you
[1:17:38] before they don't want brother Brown to
[1:17:40] come back
[1:17:41] brother Bennett Brothers came back
[1:17:43] they really don't want that to happen
[1:17:46] and I'll tell them that they really
[1:17:47] don't want him to come back a half for
[1:17:50] three quarters of the church is in this
[1:17:51] message churches in this nation he'd
[1:17:54] drive them out amen
[1:17:57] but you know what I've always said even
[1:17:59] if he did come back you know what
[1:18:01] Jesus came back
[1:18:03] he was here for 30 to 40 days
[1:18:06] and you know what you know when they
[1:18:07] told Peter this is his disciple they
[1:18:10] told Peter that Jesus had risen he went
[1:18:12] fishing
[1:18:16] you went fishing right
[1:18:18] right his brother called he died
[1:18:21] and I looked down and saw that guy
[1:18:23] sitting laying in that casket and then
[1:18:24] about three days later he appears at my
[1:18:26] house
[1:18:27] and walked through the wall don't even
[1:18:29] open the door
[1:18:33] Peter had partial understanding right
[1:18:36] right Peter had partial understanding
[1:18:39] but see on the day of Pentecost he had a
[1:18:41] perfect understanding of his partial
[1:18:44] you got to remember one thing there's
[1:18:46] only one perfect one and that's Jesus
[1:18:48] Christ and there's only one perfect age
[1:18:50] and that's his age so they all had
[1:18:52] partial understanding but it was a
[1:18:54] perfect understanding of the partial
[1:18:56] right that make any sense it was a it
[1:18:59] was a perfect understanding of the part
[1:19:01] that God had given the partial that God
[1:19:03] had given all right
[1:19:05] to withdraw from one
[1:19:08] another denomination
[1:19:12] so to separate oneself in a hostile
[1:19:15] spirit
[1:19:16] to oppose strive with dispute and
[1:19:18] contend to be at variance with oneself
[1:19:22] hesitate doubt
[1:19:24] who wants to stay impartial
[1:19:29] I mean
[1:19:32] now let's go to perfect
[1:19:36] the word perfect
[1:19:39] it's perfect
[1:19:41] man and look at this one right here
[1:19:45] a full age amen
[1:19:48] brought to its end
[1:19:50] brought
[1:19:51] you didn't do it yourself he brought you
[1:19:54] brought to its end finished
[1:19:57] wanting nothing necessary to
[1:20:00] completeness
[1:20:03] perfect that which is perfect consummate
[1:20:06] human integrity and virtue
[1:20:10] of men full grown adult a full age
[1:20:13] Armature now who wants to be in that
[1:20:15] group yeah I do tell you but you know
[1:20:18] what at one time
[1:20:20] you were in the other group yeah that's
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:22] at one time and you know what if you're
[1:20:24] born again and you're in that group God
[1:20:26] still pleased with you
[1:20:29] we're not drawing little circles
[1:20:31] we're not drawing everybody else out
[1:20:33] that's right
[1:20:34] and I want you to get something right
[1:20:36] here
[1:20:39] out of this message group that we've got
[1:20:41] now
[1:20:43] God's gonna bring our group out of that
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:47] because out of the true sea true not his
[1:20:50] in fault but out of the true seed we'll
[1:20:52] read it in just a minute will come a
[1:20:54] group that's going to not be different
[1:20:58] because we don't want to be that
[1:20:59] denominational way of saying well we're
[1:21:01] just going to separate ourselves what
[1:21:03] happens in the message it's hard to get
[1:21:04] in some of these churches because the
[1:21:06] pastors won't let you in
[1:21:08] believe me I know that and I can pick
[1:21:10] them out in a heartbeat
[1:21:12] they don't want their people to know
[1:21:14] nothing
[1:21:15] except what they preach
[1:21:18] now I've seen it 100 times
[1:21:22] so what are they doing they're making
[1:21:24] their own denomination
[1:21:25] until they're South
[1:21:27] may have some true people in there but
[1:21:30] see what the problem is is they are
[1:21:32] usually money hungry and are either just
[1:21:35] got a very small group and if if the
[1:21:38] Lord sparked something in in somebody's
[1:21:41] life and they hightail it out and go
[1:21:44] somewhere else
[1:21:45] all those people are they're hirelings
[1:21:48] people they're hiring profits
[1:21:51] Balaam was a prophet of God he could get
[1:21:55] an audience he knew how to talk to Dodd
[1:21:58] right that's right but he was a hireling
[1:22:01] he needed some money to do what he was
[1:22:03] doing another motive all right
[1:22:07] so I know that's not in this church but
[1:22:09] I want you to realize that's what's
[1:22:10] happening and that's why these things
[1:22:12] are happening in other churches
[1:22:15] because if somebody did come in and
[1:22:16] preach the true word of God in its
[1:22:18] perfected form
[1:22:20] we got to start believing that
[1:22:22] we gotta believe that
[1:22:24] we got to believe that we are listening
[1:22:26] not me not me doing the preaching we got
[1:22:29] to believe that God put us here to
[1:22:31] listen to a perfect word
[1:22:33] right that America comes from brother
[1:22:34] Donnie or brother dick or me whoever it
[1:22:36] comes from the Dale obviously
[1:22:40] doesn't matter
[1:22:42] what matters is there's no big ones
[1:22:44] Among Us there's no great one there's no
[1:22:47] well this one's much better than this
[1:22:48] one you see that in a message too to me
[1:22:51] that they're floundering so close to a
[1:22:53] denomination
[1:22:55] the Bible said come out of her my people
[1:23:02] in a message church that's what happened
[1:23:05] people getting get a birth
[1:23:08] if you get a birth I'll promise you you
[1:23:11] may flounder impartial you may have
[1:23:13] doubt and fear and anxiety about the
[1:23:15] word of God right
[1:23:17] but if that thing ever ever Rings true
[1:23:19] one time
[1:23:22] I'm not saying that to be an
[1:23:24] isolationist
[1:23:26] no no
[1:23:27] no but if it ever Rings true you know
[1:23:29] what Fountain to go to that's right you
[1:23:31] drink out of 20 Fountains of water and
[1:23:33] if you got one one it just man stands
[1:23:35] out Above the Rest it's not that they're
[1:23:37] all water not what someone's water some
[1:23:38] not no they're all water right right but
[1:23:41] one tastes a little bit better than the
[1:23:42] other one does
[1:23:43] so that's why that we we don't want it
[1:23:46] and I don't want to sound like we boast
[1:23:48] here at Lulu but I promise you one thing
[1:23:51] we got it better than a lot of people
[1:23:53] got it let me just put it that way I've
[1:23:55] been in a lot of places a lot of
[1:23:57] churches a lot I know a lot of people
[1:23:58] and I know what they're preaching I know
[1:24:00] what to teach but we you'll never be
[1:24:02] able to say on the day of judgment that
[1:24:04] I wasn't taught that all right because
[1:24:07] that's being taught here we've got to
[1:24:09] come to Perfection but you got to have a
[1:24:11] perfect word to get it there right right
[1:24:13] all right
[1:24:15] you gotta have a ladder rain of maturing
[1:24:18] rain sure the former rain is going to
[1:24:20] fall we won't have any service this
[1:24:22] afternoon I'm going to bridge service
[1:24:23] now we're gonna have a former rain
[1:24:26] the teaching rain
[1:24:28] to get it ready
[1:24:31] but that rain stops do you know if it
[1:24:33] rains all the time
[1:24:36] your crops were rot that's right yeah
[1:24:39] that's right you know if God gives you
[1:24:41] everything you want you're right
[1:24:44] amen so he's going to let you go through
[1:24:47] a little bit of dry season
[1:24:49] to do what what does the dry season do
[1:24:51] it matures you
[1:24:53] if it rained all the time it flood your
[1:24:56] crop that's right that's right don't
[1:24:57] worry people can we get over there
[1:24:59] that's when the flood's gonna happen
[1:25:00] right I mean here when that's here when
[1:25:03] we get to the fullness the Perfection
[1:25:05] that's when the flood is going to happen
[1:25:06] because what the flood's going to do is
[1:25:08] it's going to take the inside rain that
[1:25:10] you've been receiving and it's going to
[1:25:11] change this outside guy right
[1:25:13] it's going to make this partial that
[1:25:15] you're living in it's going to make it
[1:25:17] perfect
[1:25:18] so if I'm partial
[1:25:19] to perfect
[1:25:21] so no we're not going to have rain for
[1:25:23] three months usually takes about 100
[1:25:24] days for a crop to mature
[1:25:27] you get a form of rain and then the rain
[1:25:29] Seasons you might get a little shower
[1:25:30] every once in a while
[1:25:32] but that Harvest rain and now here in
[1:25:35] our country it's in like close to August
[1:25:37] I mean close to October remember our
[1:25:39] October is our harvest season
[1:25:41] but over there in about June is when
[1:25:43] their latter rain or there there's one
[1:25:45] more rain comes what does it do
[1:25:49] it helps the plant come to maturity
[1:25:51] anything that's lacking during that time
[1:25:55] that rain will mature whatever it needs
[1:25:57] those nutrients and make that corn in
[1:26:00] the tassel and make it real full
[1:26:03] all right so that's what we're in now
[1:26:05] we're in the perfect we we're bringing
[1:26:08] it to its end
[1:26:10] we're finishing it
[1:26:12] wanting nothing necessary to
[1:26:14] completeness
[1:26:16] that's a lot of people's problem they
[1:26:18] want it
[1:26:19] a lot of them don't know where to go to
[1:26:21] give it
[1:26:23] but they're still seed I don't count
[1:26:25] anybody out
[1:26:29] like brother Brown said just give me
[1:26:30] about
[1:26:31] two minutes for somebody and I'll tell
[1:26:32] you whether you're born again or not
[1:26:34] well that don't take discernment
[1:26:36] you start talking about something you
[1:26:37] know what kind of mind the person's got
[1:26:40] or what kind of doctrine that they have
[1:26:42] or what's going on in their life
[1:26:44] foreign
[1:26:46] let's go to
[1:26:48] number three
[1:26:56] go down go down to the bottom
[1:27:00] because look what we're going to read
[1:27:02] this this afternoon hold it right there
[1:27:03] hold it right there go back
[1:27:06] the scripture this afternoon is going to
[1:27:08] be Joel 2 23-26 so you can write that
[1:27:10] down
[1:27:11] but it says be glad you children of Zion
[1:27:13] now look Daughters of dying children of
[1:27:16] Zion who's he talking about
[1:27:19] one more time all right
[1:27:21] all right right
[1:27:22] so I want you to realize something
[1:27:24] every time you see that in the Bible
[1:27:26] it's talking about you
[1:27:28] right
[1:27:29] it took a prophecy to open that up bro
[1:27:31] you took a profit
[1:27:35] because that's what God was saying you
[1:27:37] children of Zion he didn't say bride in
[1:27:39] the end time
[1:27:40] because he hid it from the wise
[1:27:41] Improvement and revealed it to me and
[1:27:44] you you know why because we needed it
[1:27:47] Luther didn't need it
[1:27:50] they may understand Luther didn't need
[1:27:52] this Wesley didn't need this it wasn't
[1:27:56] that it wasn't there it was here
[1:28:00] Wesley actually had it in word form
[1:28:02] Luther and then We're translating it so
[1:28:04] Wesley had a physical Bible
[1:28:07] the Pentecostals had a physical Bible
[1:28:09] and all these other denominations have a
[1:28:11] physical Bible
[1:28:13] but what have they done with it they've
[1:28:15] done just what it says about partial
[1:28:17] they put doubt in it they put fear in it
[1:28:19] they put separation in it
[1:28:22] but be glad you children of Vine now
[1:28:25] just
[1:28:26] I'm like a lawyer now strike that from
[1:28:28] the record
[1:28:30] but you'll keep that in your mind for
[1:28:31] this afternoon go to the bottom
[1:28:34] I'm gonna read right here now it says
[1:28:37] God is going to restore the Lutheran age
[1:28:39] did not restore the church it started a
[1:28:42] Reformation the Wesleyan age did not
[1:28:45] restore the Pentecostal age did not
[1:28:47] restore now not saying they were wrong
[1:28:49] he didn't say they were wrong he said
[1:28:52] they just didn't restore what's he doing
[1:28:54] brother random read that scripture Joel
[1:28:57] too
[1:28:57] click bride and end time
[1:29:01] that's where his thought went to
[1:29:04] now it says that God's going to restore
[1:29:05] the Pentecost ladies and not the store
[1:29:06] but God has to restore for he cannot
[1:29:09] denies word amen amen this is not the
[1:29:11] resurrection of the church it is the
[1:29:13] restoration God will take the church
[1:29:16] right back to Pentecost at the beginning
[1:29:17] now notice in verse 25 it tells why we
[1:29:20] need restoration why
[1:29:23] I will restore all the years that the
[1:29:25] one because the the
[1:29:27] let me put it this way the value of the
[1:29:30] word was eaten down the word was not
[1:29:31] eaten down but the value of it
[1:29:35] is that okay
[1:29:36] partial understanding right now like I
[1:29:39] said before it's kind of like a
[1:29:40] binoculars you put binoculars up you
[1:29:42] know I mean you can see real good in a
[1:29:44] certain spot but you can't see anything
[1:29:45] out here well that's what Luther was
[1:29:47] looking through what a glass darkling he
[1:29:49] was looking through a a two Power Scope
[1:29:51] well everything behind us kind of like
[1:29:53] me
[1:29:55] I actually clear now to about brother
[1:29:57] Chris but I went back a little further
[1:29:59] it's a little blurry but you know what
[1:30:00] as I walk closer
[1:30:02] that gets more in focus
[1:30:06] but that's still blurry
[1:30:08] partial
[1:30:10] the perfect that's what Luther that's
[1:30:12] what Paul I Paul and other words here
[1:30:14] let me tell you what Paul was saying
[1:30:16] Paul's saying I can see there's a people
[1:30:19] coming
[1:30:21] a word is here
[1:30:24] Paul was so positive he said you'll be
[1:30:26] judged by my gospel now what's that
[1:30:28] doing that's taken from Paul right to
[1:30:31] the throne of judgment
[1:30:33] right you'll be judged by my gospel
[1:30:37] that's where the judgment's going to
[1:30:38] come from
[1:30:40] but
[1:30:41] there's a group of people in between
[1:30:43] Paul and that judgment that's going to
[1:30:46] catch what he was talking about
[1:30:50] that Luther didn't catch that we
[1:30:52] actually didn't catch that Pentecost
[1:30:54] didn't catch not saying they were wrong
[1:30:56] let's go back one more time because if
[1:30:57] you took those two shoots and plucked
[1:30:59] them up threw them away
[1:31:01] you got nothing but somewhere in the DNA
[1:31:03] makeup of those two Shields are the cell
[1:31:06] structure of those two shoots was what a
[1:31:08] stalk right
[1:31:09] somewhere inside that struck sound
[1:31:12] structure of that stock was an ear of
[1:31:14] corn
[1:31:15] every Apple that I've got an apple tree
[1:31:18] this year that just God has blessed I've
[1:31:21] got two pair of trees that God has
[1:31:23] blessed them up till their arms are
[1:31:24] hanging down
[1:31:25] but when I planted that tree
[1:31:29] every pair
[1:31:32] that was ever gonna that's hard to
[1:31:34] understand in human brain
[1:31:36] but it was in that first little seed
[1:31:39] somewhere
[1:31:41] you know when God planted in the Garden
[1:31:42] of Eden you know everything that we're
[1:31:44] living at now every the the
[1:31:47] zillions of Blades of grass in this
[1:31:50] world
[1:31:51] came from that one place
[1:31:54] every oak tree that you see well Pines
[1:31:56] we're in the state we're in a state
[1:31:58] where we got a lot of pine trees but you
[1:31:59] look out all over this world all the
[1:32:01] pine trees
[1:32:02] come from the Garden of Eden what was
[1:32:04] created there from what let every
[1:32:07] seed bring forth of its kind all right
[1:32:11] so somewhere in in our
[1:32:14] I was telling them the other day in our
[1:32:16] DNA structure
[1:32:20] somewhere not what Mom and Daddy brought
[1:32:22] you that's partial right but when you're
[1:32:25] get when you're born again at baby form
[1:32:27] when you get the Holy Ghost and God just
[1:32:29] absolutely comes to you and washes you
[1:32:32] and and gives you the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:34] gives you a zeal
[1:32:36] brother Rams you've got everything you
[1:32:37] need right but that's still partial
[1:32:40] that's right
[1:32:42] right
[1:32:44] everything that baby needs at Birth
[1:32:47] five fingers on each hand
[1:32:50] all right
[1:32:53] but that DNA structure is not made to
[1:32:56] stay where it is but yet that's all the
[1:32:58] DNA that that child will ever get right
[1:33:00] it'll never get another DNA from
[1:33:02] somebody else that DNA makeup of that
[1:33:04] whole child is inside that little bitty
[1:33:06] baby right so what you do you feed it
[1:33:08] and it does what those five fingers just
[1:33:11] go from about this long to about this
[1:33:12] long
[1:33:13] you tell me one thing we were talking
[1:33:16] about this last Sunday
[1:33:19] the body you live in now in a human
[1:33:21] Fallen condition
[1:33:23] is still almost perfect
[1:33:27] think of all the functions that goes on
[1:33:29] in your body
[1:33:30] while you're sleeping right that's so
[1:33:33] involuntary you never even
[1:33:36] you don't have to go brief Breathe
[1:33:39] Me me no so even in a even in a sinful
[1:33:44] loss condition
[1:33:46] that partial
[1:33:48] close to perfect
[1:33:51] so close that you can't separate them
[1:33:52] because one day that perfect is going to
[1:33:54] take this partial and change it change
[1:33:58] it not not separate you brother call it
[1:34:01] no you're not going to die you're going
[1:34:02] you're going into change of the body
[1:34:04] all that black hair that I saw that was
[1:34:06] from about right here back it's going to
[1:34:08] come back
[1:34:10] we grew up together haven't we been but
[1:34:13] but see that we realize that like
[1:34:16] brother Claude said when he saw June
[1:34:17] tonight when we have her surprise
[1:34:20] birthday party he saw me and Janet 18 to
[1:34:22] 20 years old he'd never seen this attack
[1:34:24] before
[1:34:24] so we saw us at 18 to 20 years old
[1:34:27] and he was just crying like a baby
[1:34:29] and he told the church out there he said
[1:34:31] I saw them
[1:34:34] the way I'm going to see him
[1:34:35] when the body change happens that's why
[1:34:38] we got that thing downstairs for that
[1:34:39] the people that we love you we haven't
[1:34:41] seen when you were 18 to 20 years old a
[1:34:43] lot of you we have
[1:34:45] but that perfect is going to take over
[1:34:49] that commercial amen amen and it's going
[1:34:51] to change it it's not going to take
[1:34:53] James Cauley out of here and and put him
[1:34:56] in a new one over here
[1:34:58] right no
[1:35:00] he's not going to take this Earth
[1:35:03] and destroy it no
[1:35:05] this Earth was made for me and you
[1:35:07] didn't have it that's right in our book
[1:35:09] of Isaiah all right let me get back to
[1:35:11] this but our bodies
[1:35:13] are almost perfect
[1:35:19] a locust cake war and caterpillar pump
[1:35:20] worm have eaten all but the root and
[1:35:22] small bit of the stem now we're told
[1:35:24] that all these insects are all one the
[1:35:25] same in different stages
[1:35:28] boy would you like to put the four
[1:35:30] horseraders in there
[1:35:32] you could do it
[1:35:35] because you got four horseriders
[1:35:38] you got four Spirits getting destroyed
[1:35:39] you got four Spirits just bringing it my
[1:35:41] four steps of the Same Spirit that's
[1:35:44] bringing the back just in case the
[1:35:45] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:35:46] and the word
[1:35:48] the word's got to be with short in the
[1:35:49] end times now just give us a holy ghost
[1:35:51] to believe this right here all that's
[1:35:53] got to come here for restoration
[1:35:55] see
[1:35:58] where were we now we are told that these
[1:36:00] insects are one in the same in different
[1:36:01] stages that is right they are the
[1:36:03] Antichrist spirit manifested in
[1:36:05] organization denomination and false
[1:36:07] Doctrine so you can don't worry about
[1:36:09] organization denomination
[1:36:11] even thoughts doctors in this message
[1:36:13] but sits Through the Ages and that poor
[1:36:14] little rooting stop is going to be
[1:36:16] restored God isn't going to plan a new
[1:36:17] church
[1:36:19] God's Not Gonna plan on you James Colley
[1:36:24] he's going to take what he planted
[1:36:25] originally
[1:36:27] and he's going to restore it God isn't
[1:36:28] going to plan a new church but he's
[1:36:31] going to bring his original planting
[1:36:33] back to Original Seed he is doing it as
[1:36:36] stated in verse 23 we'll read it this
[1:36:38] afternoon by the teaching or former
[1:36:40] Reign next we'll come to harvest rain
[1:36:42] are rapturing
[1:36:45] faith
[1:36:47] now in that partial we didn't see
[1:36:49] anything about faith did we
[1:36:51] it was doubt fear separation
[1:36:55] um all those bad things but perfect
[1:36:58] is that rapturing face all right
[1:37:01] go to number four
[1:37:11] but that's in the gates of the enemy
[1:37:14] I'm not reading these out I guess I
[1:37:15] should tell you where they're at because
[1:37:17] some people that are listening know but
[1:37:22] now look
[1:37:26] let's don't make this so natural that we
[1:37:28] get carnal about it
[1:37:30] but Abraham did
[1:37:32] have a
[1:37:34] seed true seed which is his true seed
[1:37:37] his personal proceed was Isaac
[1:37:40] right right because Isaac came forth
[1:37:43] from him right but it was not the
[1:37:44] promise right I'm additional right
[1:37:47] Ishmael came out but Isaac was the one
[1:37:49] that was promised
[1:37:51] but I don't believe that the true Seed
[1:37:54] of Abraham will fail why do you say true
[1:37:56] seed Abraham had seed
[1:37:59] Abraham had seven children after he had
[1:38:01] one but it was only one promise
[1:38:03] like in the same in the church ages
[1:38:05] there's only one promised Church age
[1:38:06] that's going to come to perfect
[1:38:08] realization but I don't believe that the
[1:38:10] true city of Abraham will fail they'll
[1:38:12] stand just as gallant and loyal as
[1:38:14] Abraham did
[1:38:16] him did but More's Original Seed then
[1:38:18] from a little group of the true seed of
[1:38:20] the word
[1:38:21] God will present Christ The Beloved
[1:38:23] bride a virgin a virgin of his word and
[1:38:26] through them
[1:38:30] everybody say that with me through them
[1:38:33] through them
[1:38:36] buy them
[1:38:38] will be fulfilled all that has been
[1:38:42] promised for his word Luther didn't do
[1:38:45] that Luther couldn't say that he didn't
[1:38:46] fulfill all the words Brother Richard
[1:38:48] Marlo he did
[1:38:49] Wesley did not fulfill all the word of
[1:38:51] God
[1:38:52] Pentecost didn't fulfill all the word of
[1:38:54] God but look they were a part of the
[1:38:55] word of God Amen amen partial p-a-r-t
[1:38:58] partial
[1:38:59] they were part of the word
[1:39:03] but perfect
[1:39:05] is what we're looking at and through
[1:39:07] them and by them will be fulfilled all
[1:39:10] that has been promised for his word and
[1:39:12] the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed
[1:39:14] our Dogma The Word of Promise in himself
[1:39:17] like it was in Mary God himself made
[1:39:19] manifest he will act himself by his own
[1:39:22] Word of Promise so to fulfill all that
[1:39:25] has been written of him
[1:39:27] now who's you doing this through don't
[1:39:29] forget that part out there he's doing
[1:39:31] all this through a group of people
[1:39:35] he will act himself by his own Word of
[1:39:37] Promise so to fulfill all that has been
[1:39:38] written of him as he did when he came
[1:39:40] from the Virgin womb now he's talking
[1:39:41] about Jesus himself
[1:39:43] Jesus came from Mary's virgin womb right
[1:39:46] Spirit womb now so will the Virgin now
[1:39:49] accepting his word being unto me as thou
[1:39:51] has said though it was said by an Angel
[1:39:54] while it yet was written word Isaiah 9
[1:39:56] 6. they will love him love his and will
[1:40:01] have this potentials for he is their
[1:40:03] head and they are his subjects subject
[1:40:05] to his head headship of Christ
[1:40:07] was his now let's go to number six
[1:40:11] look hurry this is Harvest Time 1964.
[1:40:13] look hurry there must come a true seed
[1:40:17] now he's not saying there's not seed on
[1:40:19] the Earth
[1:40:20] Pentecost had a seed right the word of
[1:40:24] God
[1:40:26] remember the little statement that I
[1:40:27] that I that I uh give you last time the
[1:40:31] word that you were supposed to fulfill
[1:40:32] God had that waiting on you he knew
[1:40:35] you'd want it there so you drew it right
[1:40:37] out of the word of God well Luther was
[1:40:38] the same way that Joshua led by faith
[1:40:40] God in Unit A Man Called Luther was
[1:40:41] going to grab that and distribute it
[1:40:43] among his people they're going to catch
[1:40:45] it and become Born Again Wesley was
[1:40:47] going to come in with sanctification
[1:40:49] same way up to the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:51] Ghost but that was only partial
[1:40:54] but they had a perfect Holy Ghost
[1:40:56] there's not a partial Holy Ghost okay
[1:41:00] the only way you can be this and this is
[1:41:02] the only problem we have in the end time
[1:41:04] is called anointing ones
[1:41:06] there's where you make Believers come in
[1:41:08] that's why that third group comes in as
[1:41:09] a make-believer the true Holy Ghost can
[1:41:13] come down and anoint the rain falls on
[1:41:16] the just and the unjust
[1:41:19] and they can grow and like I said a weed
[1:41:22] seat a weed a weed seed and a wheat seed
[1:41:25] would look the same down here but let
[1:41:28] them just keep manifesting
[1:41:30] this one's going to start growing thorns
[1:41:32] and and and things and and pushing
[1:41:35] people out and you reach and get them in
[1:41:37] there
[1:41:38] they're untouchable
[1:41:41] well you can take that one a long way
[1:41:42] look hurry there must come a true seed
[1:41:45] there has just got to be because he's
[1:41:47] coming for the bride without spotter
[1:41:49] wrinkle he's coming for it a word
[1:41:51] Vindicated bride oh she'll be such a
[1:41:53] little
[1:41:54] bitty
[1:41:56] group let's see look at look at
[1:41:58] paragraph 298 but see the bride is going
[1:42:00] to be made up of all down through that
[1:42:02] had the word in their age
[1:42:04] it's not just this last group God is
[1:42:07] going to take the whole thing out of
[1:42:08] here
[1:42:09] it'll be so small be surprising they'll
[1:42:11] come up missing you won't even know
[1:42:13] they're gone
[1:42:14] what if you took 500 people
[1:42:17] but the secret coming but now remember
[1:42:19] we must add not add to the word of God
[1:42:22] or add to the prophet's message he's not
[1:42:24] just saying that the bride's going to be
[1:42:25] made up all down through and they're all
[1:42:27] going to be the same no his point his
[1:42:29] text is there's a true seed gonna come
[1:42:32] out of that
[1:42:34] hmm
[1:42:39] to fulfill Hebrews 11 40.
[1:42:43] a perfect group
[1:42:46] a complete group
[1:42:49] a group without spot or wrinkle
[1:42:53] if you and I are Miss Jesus
[1:42:58] and we have his potentials
[1:43:02] potentials
[1:43:04] then whose fault is it that we don't
[1:43:06] have them
[1:43:07] powers
[1:43:10] I was telling them this past weekend
[1:43:15] you know when you have an act of a play
[1:43:18] if we we used to go to the to the
[1:43:20] Passion Play Now what if they would have
[1:43:24] practiced that play which they do for
[1:43:26] months they have to now there's such a
[1:43:29] wonderful production and there's really
[1:43:31] if they make a mistake you wouldn't know
[1:43:33] it
[1:43:35] but when they started acting the play
[1:43:38] out
[1:43:42] Jesus was missing
[1:43:44] the whole thing is built around the
[1:43:46] crucifixion
[1:43:50] and they start their play
[1:43:53] Jesus is missing
[1:43:57] do they complete the play
[1:44:00] no
[1:44:02] they couldn't complete the play because
[1:44:04] the actor was missing
[1:44:07] the man that portrayed Jesus was missing
[1:44:10] then they look over there
[1:44:12] well where's the one that played Mary
[1:44:15] well she's missing she'll be here in
[1:44:16] about 15 minutes
[1:44:18] she's supposed to be on stage then
[1:44:20] all right well Jesus well he's been here
[1:44:24] by 15 20 minutes he wouldn't do
[1:44:25] something he'll be right back
[1:44:27] my point is the play could not even
[1:44:29] begin
[1:44:32] the play cannot even begin to end
[1:44:36] because you gotta start before you can
[1:44:37] finish
[1:44:40] now this is what I believe
[1:44:42] I believe now that all the actors
[1:44:46] of the play that we've been rehearsing
[1:44:49] for two thousand years six thousand
[1:44:51] years
[1:44:52] all the Old Testament prophets have done
[1:44:54] what they were supposed to do and
[1:44:55] they're gone
[1:44:56] all I said all all of the seven churches
[1:45:00] Messengers have come and did what they
[1:45:02] were supposed to do and they're gone
[1:45:05] it's like God has just left us alone
[1:45:09] to try to figure this thing out
[1:45:11] but no
[1:45:12] the director has got everybody on the
[1:45:15] stage that's right I believe all the 144
[1:45:18] 000 is Alive and Well somewhere in the
[1:45:20] world I said somewhere in the world
[1:45:23] the two witnesses I believe they're
[1:45:25] alive and well somewhere on this Earth
[1:45:27] this is how close I think we are not 40
[1:45:30] years from now not 10 years from now not
[1:45:32] five years from now
[1:45:34] if you got the 144 000 on the stage see
[1:45:36] 144 000 wasn't hearing losing today
[1:45:41] they weren't all hearing brother Brown
[1:45:43] that's right or the age that he was
[1:45:45] alive right right the two prophets who
[1:45:48] knows
[1:45:50] but I know one thing's for sure
[1:45:52] you and I weren't in the message most of
[1:45:54] us in 1916 61 and 62. so that part of
[1:45:59] the actors had not shown up yet that's
[1:46:01] right
[1:46:02] now
[1:46:04] gathered amen
[1:46:06] 144 000.
[1:46:09] the bride
[1:46:10] the word
[1:46:14] that's why brother Brown said in 1963 he
[1:46:16] said all I can see is left the coming of
[1:46:18] the Lord
[1:46:20] now he was prophesied
[1:46:22] but I say today in 2011
[1:46:25] there is nobody that's supposed to
[1:46:27] appear
[1:46:29] it's not sorry that's not already on
[1:46:31] this Earth that's right
[1:46:33] I just believe that
[1:46:35] because I feel it Amen brother 144 000
[1:46:39] they're getting ready yes but they
[1:46:41] cannot come up
[1:46:43] without us going up right right amen the
[1:46:45] two prophets can't receive their message
[1:46:48] without us leaving that's right so guess
[1:46:51] what this whole thing is holding up on
[1:46:53] me and you listening
[1:46:57] to become true see
[1:47:00] sure
[1:47:01] you may be true seed
[1:47:04] I believe both Tom was two things amen
[1:47:08] but something in in in the Providence of
[1:47:12] God
[1:47:13] kept that partial from being perfect
[1:47:18] and you and I if we keep going any
[1:47:20] longer and it's not just you buddy just
[1:47:22] you just happen to be standing there if
[1:47:24] we
[1:47:25] go on another five years
[1:47:29] you know we were talking this weekend
[1:47:31] about a lot of the old people brother
[1:47:33] Carol a lot of those in their 80s
[1:47:36] if God don't come in the next four or
[1:47:38] five years
[1:47:39] we're gonna see others go
[1:47:43] so guess what as long as I'm alive and
[1:47:45] well
[1:47:47] that's what that's what the Bible says
[1:47:49] which are alive and remain
[1:47:53] I like that live in remain part that's
[1:47:57] me and you we're alive and remain
[1:48:00] right now we're alive we can do
[1:48:02] something about this
[1:48:03] thank you brother
[1:48:07] the partial to perfect now this
[1:48:09] afternoon we'll dig into a little bit
[1:48:10] more and show you a little bit about the
[1:48:11] former ladder rain because
[1:48:13] it's very important that we understand
[1:48:16] that because it's a part of our growing
[1:48:19] process
[1:48:22] the rain is the Holy Ghost we got to
[1:48:25] understand what comes for and what come
[1:48:27] ladder
[1:48:30] but he's going to pour out his Spirit it
[1:48:31] says on All Flesh in the end time
[1:48:34] so the only way you're going to be able
[1:48:35] to tell
[1:48:38] make believers is give them the word
[1:48:41] test give them the word test if you give
[1:48:43] them the word test right
[1:48:45] right you'll find out
[1:48:47] whether they're one or the other
[1:48:50] and I promise you
[1:48:52] we're at the Harvest rain
[1:48:57] this is my last point the teachings went
[1:48:59] forth
[1:49:00] brother Brown sewed the word down we're
[1:49:02] reading spoken words Original Seed he
[1:49:04] said pure and unadulterated now what are
[1:49:06] you not going to do about it
[1:49:08] you and I must react to that and become
[1:49:11] part of it if not
[1:49:13] we will continue in partial realization
[1:49:17] and God will have to take us out here
[1:49:20] but that which is perfect has come
[1:49:23] that which is in part
[1:49:25] you're not going to see the old Gary
[1:49:28] like the old gear used to be
[1:49:30] you're not going to see the old way like
[1:49:31] it used to be if you do
[1:49:33] the things that we did in the world if
[1:49:35] you're going to see those things
[1:49:37] then we weren't part of even the the
[1:49:38] beginning of of the we weren't even seed
[1:49:40] to begin with right
[1:49:43] but that's my whole my whole driving
[1:49:46] point
[1:49:47] is to realize one thing
[1:49:50] this thing is almost over
[1:49:54] the actors are on the stage they're not
[1:49:57] being called
[1:49:59] and I don't believe that they're
[1:50:00] practicing
[1:50:03] I believe the play is getting ready
[1:50:06] because brother Brown said when the
[1:50:07] bride realizes who she is and what she's
[1:50:10] doing here
[1:50:13] what she's doing here in other words
[1:50:17] the actor knows what to do once the play
[1:50:20] starts
[1:50:22] and she'll be an invincible Army that's
[1:50:24] our problem we're wandering and
[1:50:25] wondering was about this and wondering
[1:50:27] about one of my be a Christian
[1:50:30] start with being a Christian that's
[1:50:31] right start with being a good guy good
[1:50:33] girl start with just being a Christian
[1:50:35] come to church read your Bible study the
[1:50:37] word of God study to show yourself a
[1:50:38] present don't be like let's don't be
[1:50:40] Catholic
[1:50:42] let's don't say brother Dale pray for us
[1:50:43] do all the praying do all the studying
[1:50:45] we'll just come sit down give us three
[1:50:47] Hail Marys and go home
[1:50:49] no
[1:50:50] that's not us people
[1:50:53] we all fall short
[1:50:55] but there's one thing you can do about
[1:50:57] it you know I was thinking while I was
[1:50:59] playing on the Garden or the play on the
[1:51:01] food plots yesterday
[1:51:02] about the devil
[1:51:06] you know the bride is an invincible Army
[1:51:09] right that's right there's nothing in
[1:51:11] the Bible
[1:51:13] that says that Satan is invincible
[1:51:17] there's nothing in the Bible that says
[1:51:19] he has all power
[1:51:21] there's nothing in the Bible that says
[1:51:23] that he's this he's this great being
[1:51:27] even though he's next to God's brother
[1:51:29] again
[1:51:30] even though it's next to God never in
[1:51:33] the word of God it says that Satan is
[1:51:36] more powerful than you are if you're
[1:51:39] born again
[1:51:41] because listen to this listen to this
[1:51:45] resist the devil
[1:51:47] and he'll flee from you
[1:51:51] I like what brother Claude said brother
[1:51:53] Claude said Satan must be bald headed no
[1:51:57] teeth and no hair on his chest because
[1:51:59] brother Brown said faith
[1:52:02] and hair on his chest Faith had teeth
[1:52:04] and Faith had hair on his head so Satan
[1:52:08] must be bald Toothless and no hair on
[1:52:10] his chest so remember remember what
[1:52:11] brother Brown remember that guy said boo
[1:52:15] it was the devil and what he said he was
[1:52:16] Satan he said he said Booth he said I
[1:52:18] just said blue back
[1:52:20] he said he just got smaller and smaller
[1:52:24] why does the Bible say one day we're
[1:52:25] going to walk by this guy and look down
[1:52:27] as like a bum sitting on the side of the
[1:52:29] road and say is this the man that
[1:52:30] brought Nations to its knees that's
[1:52:32] right is this the man we're gonna Wonder
[1:52:35] in Wonderland why we let that God
[1:52:38] torment us when he has no power
[1:52:41] except what God gives him
[1:52:44] no power
[1:52:45] he's powerless
[1:52:48] true C
[1:52:51] partial to perfect your newborn
[1:52:53] Christian pray to God give you perfect
[1:52:55] understanding
[1:52:57] if you're along in the way
[1:53:00] pray to God get you out of the way
[1:53:03] but pray that God give you perfect
[1:53:04] understanding because without perfect
[1:53:06] understanding we're not going to get out
[1:53:07] of here this partial man is going to
[1:53:09] steal control and going to take over and
[1:53:11] we're going to die and go by Grace but
[1:53:13] one group of people out of the true sea
[1:53:16] is going to become a group of people
[1:53:18] that's going to take a body change let's
