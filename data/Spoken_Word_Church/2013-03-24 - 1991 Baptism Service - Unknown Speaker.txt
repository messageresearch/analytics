TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Sam I leave always like read scripture enrollment 64 we have a baptism service just listen to the wording of the scripture what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to see and live any longer therein so you not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with me on by baptism of the Dead that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life or if we have been planted together in the life isn't it dead we shall all be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin / he that is dead is freed from sin now if we'd be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised the dead guys no more death has no more dominion over him or him that he died he died on descent once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God we don't believe in water baptism under regeneration but we believe that when you're baptized that you are showing for the world what you believe axel it stated are that if we're very with you in Baptism and that's what your baptism does it means that shows you go down into a break did you come back up out of there to walk in the newness of life that's what the water does it doesn't water doesn't clean cheering I guess what you believe but it is what you believe then what you believe in what it doesn't then it cleanse you and then you'll hear me say this because I just believe the scripture we baptized a little different than some people who some bitter are here to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because jesus said in Matthew 28 19 to go baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son they said name single for the name of father if you don't get a name out of it the name of the Father with the Lord the name of the son we know is cheap oh that did not and then the Holy Ghost would be crying so that's father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ then that fulfills description and you'll hear me saying to fulfill what Jesus said to baptize in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost i baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus because the father son Holy Ghost not a knight it's just a title i'ma father's parmesan I'm a human being but my manual family okay so we have to have a knife what he said to take tonight so we're buried in your life which is in work we're walking you to school I brother Maloney that you actually bless you can order according stormy banks i standing castaways 40 will you come and feel and where my who's it choose life to fulfill the Great Commission our Lord and saviors in the backpack Father and of the Son and I now baptize my little brother tutorial in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a man gave me both failed a great commission dies in the name of the Father Son and of the Holy Ghost i baptize my little bro Josh in the name of rocks to grave limbo anybody else while we're here I never leave an opportunity and don't want to say that they've anybody here think they have a bad time you tell these two that was baptized how much you appreciate them taking a stand for the Lord earth in their life walk with the Lord give her life to the Lord for their will get such a foot hope now like he did on some of us everything they come to the Lord you just tell how much appreciated angel we freaking go right
