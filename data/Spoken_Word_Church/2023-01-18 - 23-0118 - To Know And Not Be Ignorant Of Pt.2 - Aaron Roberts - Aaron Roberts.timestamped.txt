[10:10] scripture Lord
[10:12] that we should know these things and
[10:15] Lord as Paul said I would not have you
[10:18] be ignorant of these things Lord just to
[10:19] stir up our minds in a way of
[10:21] remembrance to look at these things and
[10:22] remember these things that are in the
[10:24] scripture

[12:03] Lord bless your bride around the world
[12:04] we pray we commit all things to you in
[12:06] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[12:09] amen Romans chapter 3 verse 19.
[12:13] it says now we know that what things
[12:16] soever the law saith it saith to them
[12:18] who are under the law that every mouth
[12:21] may be stopped and all the world may
[12:24] become guilty before God therefore by
[12:26] the Deeds of the law there shall no
[12:28] flesh be justified in his sight for by
[12:31] the law is the knowledge of sin
[12:34] but now the righteousness of God without
[12:36] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[12:39] the law and the prophets even the
[12:41] righteousness of God which is by faith
[12:44] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[12:48] them that believe for there is no
[12:50] difference
[12:51] for all have sinned and come short of
[12:53] the glory of God being justified freely
[12:56] by his grace through the Redemption that
[12:58] is in Christ Jesus whom God hath set
[13:01] forth to be a propitiation through faith
[13:04] in his blood to declare his
[13:06] righteousness for the remission of sins
[13:07] that are passed through the forbearance
[13:10] of God
[13:11] to declare I say at this time his
[13:14] righteousness that he might be the just
[13:16] and the justifier of him which believeth
[13:19] in Jesus and then we'll turn over to
[13:22] First Corinthians
[13:25] chapter 10.
[13:28] and verse 1.
[13:30] it says moreover Brethren I would not
[13:34] that ye should be ignorant how that all
[13:37] our fathers were under the cloud and all
[13:39] passed through the sea and were all
[13:41] baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in
[13:43] the sea and it eat I'll eat the same
[13:46] spiritual meat and did all drink the
[13:48] same spiritual drink for they drink of
[13:51] that spiritual rock that followed them
[13:54] and that rock was Christ but with many
[13:57] of them God was not well pleased for
[13:59] they were overthrown
[14:01] in the wilderness amen God bless you you
[14:03] have your seats this evening
[14:06] and just going to continue on from
[14:09] where we were at
[14:11] last Wednesday
[14:13] and speaking on to know and and not be
[14:16] ignorant of
[14:20] here
[14:24] and
[14:25] Romans chapter 3 we know that in the in
[14:29] the and Paul's peeking up here in in
[14:32] Romans 3 and and he begins to talk about
[14:35] the
[14:36] the Jews and you know he says there's no
[14:39] benefit they they asked what was the
[14:42] benefit of of the Jews he said
[14:45] really the only thing was they received
[14:47] the Oracles of God they received the
[14:49] they received the law but it didn't do
[14:52] them
[14:53] any any benefit because if they didn't
[14:56] have faith to believe in in what what
[14:58] God had said the word that was given to
[15:00] them it didn't benefit them and then he
[15:03] was as he continues on he begins to talk
[15:05] about you know there's there's no
[15:07] benefit because even the Gentiles who
[15:09] didn't God didn't even deal with the
[15:11] Gentiles and they were alienated from
[15:13] God and they were cut off and we were
[15:16] under sin because of we didn't have a
[15:19] way back
[15:21] so we were understanding but they had
[15:23] given were given the law but because of
[15:25] the law only brought them to a knowledge
[15:27] it didn't bring them into a perfect uh
[15:32] relationship with God it didn't it
[15:34] didn't cover them so that's the reason
[15:35] he said that when the law was given
[15:39] he said that the law was given that
[15:41] nobody has a
[15:43] it says unto them that are under law
[15:45] that every mouth may be stopped and all
[15:48] the world may become guilty before God
[15:51] now through the through the law you
[15:53] actually realize that you're guilty
[15:55] you you become you realize who you where
[15:58] you're at
[15:59] and so when you see that you you've
[16:01] become guilty through that
[16:04] that when you see when you see those
[16:06] then you realize that no no Deeds that
[16:09] you can do under the law is ever going
[16:11] to justify you
[16:13] but when you don't realize when you
[16:14] realize that there's nothing that you
[16:15] can do the only thing that you have is
[16:18] the righteousness of God so you have to
[16:20] accept the righteousness of God and
[16:23] through that you can become perfect
[16:25] before God and you can come into the
[16:27] right condition before God but that's
[16:29] the only thing it takes it takes faith
[16:30] in what God has what God has done and
[16:33] not anything that you can do
[16:35] and so when the when the scripture talks
[16:38] about the children of Israel when they
[16:40] begin to walk in the journey they had to
[16:43] have faith in what God Said
[16:45] and that was that was the same problem
[16:47] that they you know that they had was
[16:49] when they when the word was given to
[16:51] them for them to follow it they did not
[16:54] have faith in what God had said
[16:56] and he says and many of them were
[16:58] overthrown why because they didn't walk
[17:00] by faith
[17:02] because they walked by the things that
[17:04] they saw and he said it's the same thing
[17:06] with us that we have to have and realize
[17:08] that there's nothing that nothing you're
[17:11] going to do
[17:13] I I thank God there's nothing there's
[17:15] nothing that I can do to take me out
[17:17] and there's nothing that I can do to put
[17:19] me in
[17:21] it's all by God's grace
[17:24] it's because what God has done for me I
[17:26] just accept that
[17:29] you know uh you know many times I've
[17:31] seen people that you know they they go
[17:33] and you know the Lord begins to deal
[17:35] with them and the first thing they do is
[17:37] they they want to get baptized you know
[17:39] they want to follow the scriptural
[17:41] process and understand this is what I
[17:43] need to do and they go get baptized well
[17:45] you know what that's a good that's a
[17:48] good outward work that's something that
[17:50] you do as a as a showing but you know
[17:52] water doesn't change you baptism doesn't
[17:56] change you
[17:57] and you know because we understand that
[17:59] because of the uh the nature of a person
[18:03] when you're when you're born you have
[18:05] that fall in nature water baptism is not
[18:07] going to clean you it's not it's showing
[18:10] what that God has begun to do a work in
[18:12] you and you're taking God at his word
[18:14] and you're going to follow God's word
[18:16] because there's something that you I see
[18:18] that I need to be baptized why because
[18:20] that's God's word and I'm going to
[18:22] fulfill God's word but many times the
[18:24] problem is is when they go to the water
[18:26] and they get baptized and they come up
[18:28] then they expect that everything's going
[18:30] no it is God has to there is a the
[18:33] justification doesn't come by water
[18:35] justification comes by faith in God's
[18:38] word when we take God at his word that
[18:40] he can justify us that's what he that's
[18:43] what Paul is saying here so you
[18:45] justification comes by faith and God
[18:48] cuts off our past sins God doesn't
[18:51] remember those anymore and then he says
[18:53] that we are as a outward showing that
[18:56] God is doing a work in us we go to the
[18:58] water showing that we're laying the old
[19:00] man down and we're coming back up but
[19:02] the problem is is that old man is still
[19:04] there you're still dealing with the old
[19:07] man you still got to fight that old
[19:10] thing
[19:11] and many times people get get
[19:13] discouraged because when they go into
[19:16] the water and they come up they expect
[19:18] some miraculous Miracle to take place
[19:20] well sometimes it does for some people
[19:22] and other people you know what they go
[19:24] down and they come back up and they
[19:26] still got to fight the same Spirits they
[19:28] got to fight the same Devils that they
[19:30] did before they went in the water and
[19:32] not realizing that I'm continuing to
[19:35] walk by faith and I'm going to put my
[19:37] faith in God well then guess what I
[19:39] still gotta I still gotta overcome the
[19:41] same devil that that I saw when I walked
[19:43] down under the water
[19:45] you know what because you know it's not
[19:47] like the devil gets slick and he falls
[19:49] off
[19:50] you're not going to wash him off
[19:54] but what does it take it takes the word
[19:56] it takes you know what I have because
[19:59] that is part of the word and I continue
[20:01] to walk by that and then the other part
[20:03] of that is walking and continuing in the
[20:06] word and feeding on the word and
[20:09] meditating on the word and being in the
[20:11] word and believing What God Says
[20:14] and many times it's Society it's the
[20:17] same process that we go through we read
[20:19] the scripture there are things we don't
[20:20] understand but you know what we hold
[20:22] them before God we still hold them
[20:24] before God and waiting on him to Quicken
[20:27] it to us for him to reveal it to us but
[20:29] it's the same process you just keep
[20:30] going and you keep feeding on it and
[20:32] what do you have to do you've got to
[20:33] step away from the things and lay aside
[20:36] all the things that you had before
[20:38] you can't go to the same places that you
[20:40] went before you can't be in you can't
[20:42] see the same things that you saw before
[20:44] you can't talk the same people that you
[20:47] talked to before
[20:49] because you know it's just like people
[20:51] when they when they go to you know
[20:54] you see people that go in into a rehab
[20:57] situation or whatever when you go into
[20:59] this place and you're trying to do these
[21:01] things it's good but the problem is is
[21:03] you've got to lay that old thing down
[21:05] you've got to move on to something else
[21:06] and it's the same way with God when you
[21:09] lay down your the problems and I'm
[21:11] stepping in I'm walking forward with God
[21:13] you know I can't go back and talk the
[21:16] same thing I talked before
[21:18] you know the thing is because when when
[21:21] I put my faith in Jesus Christ and I say
[21:23] you know what I am I am saved because I
[21:25] have faith in God then you know what I
[21:27] should never talk the devil's language
[21:30] I don't know if God's going to do it you
[21:33] know what if God done it one time and if
[21:35] he's ever done it because you know what
[21:37] he brought all the people through the
[21:39] Bible all the people that he's ever
[21:41] brought through and you know what if you
[21:43] want to find a fake if you want to find
[21:45] somebody then you'll find somebody real
[21:47] somewhere you if you can find a
[21:49] counterfeit that there's got to be a
[21:50] genuine somewhere and every time the day
[21:53] will appoint you to somebody that falls
[21:54] and fails and is a little you know a
[21:56] Slicker or whatever else but you know
[21:58] what you'll always find somebody that is
[22:01] true to the word you will find a true
[22:04] genuine Christian
[22:08] and you'll find somebody so you can look
[22:10] at it and say well this person was this
[22:12] way and you can't no you got to get your
[22:14] eyes because if you want to see what God
[22:17] God just didn't come and write a book
[22:19] but he come and he manifested himself
[22:21] into people
[22:24] you know because anytime you want to
[22:26] fight you can find somebody that's true
[22:28] to God's word that's a true Christian
[22:32] now that doesn't mean that they don't
[22:33] have faults and failures they don't have
[22:35] problems but you know what you'll see
[22:37] somebody that knows how to overcome
[22:39] somebody knows how to handle their
[22:40] problems
[22:42] why because you know it's because if
[22:45] somebody's come through and you're a
[22:47] real true Christian then the thing is as
[22:49] God begins to work through you and then
[22:51] as as brother Wade's been preaching on
[22:52] you come through faith and then you've
[22:54] got to have virtue and knowledge you
[22:56] want because those virtues are being
[22:57] built into you and then you begin to
[23:00] display them not not just to have them
[23:02] and say well look what I've got no you
[23:04] display them to other people to be
[23:07] edifying to the body God doesn't do just
[23:10] anything just to be doing it but it's
[23:12] all for the body
[23:15] one of the things I just want to thank I
[23:18] was preaching on it brother JT says you
[23:19] know as a body as the the body has a
[23:23] Ministry
[23:24] we all have a Ministry we all have a
[23:27] part to play and you know everybody's
[23:28] like well you know I don't have somebody
[23:30] well God didn't call me to be somebody
[23:32] else
[23:33] God didn't call me to be in the same
[23:35] spot as somebody else he called me to be
[23:37] in my spot and the problem is is I got
[23:39] to be faithful to what God called me to
[23:41] be
[23:42] I came I can't be somebody else and you
[23:45] can't be me
[23:46] thank the Lord that you don't have to be
[23:48] me
[23:50] but you know what God only called us to
[23:52] who we are supposed to be and that's all
[23:54] God wants us to be is faithful told the
[23:57] calling that we have
[23:59] and so then we the part of that calling
[24:02] is to show people Jesus Christ
[24:06] and so when we're when when you're
[24:08] walking then you can find somebody
[24:09] that's genuine and God will give you
[24:12] somebody somebody will put somebody
[24:13] somewhere along your path that'll speak
[24:16] to you that you'll see Jesus Christ in
[24:18] them
[24:20] you know sometimes it's not just the
[24:22] preacher
[24:24] but you know thank God we've had we've
[24:26] had Godly Parents we've had we've had
[24:29] Holyfield holy ghost-filled parents that
[24:32] were able to raise us so we know who we
[24:34] know what what the Life of Christ is
[24:38] we know what the love of God is why
[24:40] because we were we were that was
[24:42] manifested to us they were showed us the
[24:44] Life of Christ to raise us up and then
[24:47] sometimes people didn't come from
[24:49] backgrounds like that but you know
[24:50] there's oh I've never met anybody that
[24:52] didn't have a that's not had a Christian
[24:54] Journey somewhere in their life that
[24:56] somebody God didn't put somebody across
[24:58] their path to speak to them it wasn't
[25:00] always a preacher
[25:04] it wasn't always a deacon
[25:07] I think about brother biscoll one time
[25:10] and he was talking about that his dad
[25:12] was watching this woman
[25:17] and she was uh
[25:19] you know just just a housewife out
[25:22] washing clothes and doing different
[25:23] things but he said he kept watching that
[25:26] woman's life
[25:28] and brother Biscoe said his dad's
[25:29] watched that woman's life so much he
[25:31] said because just by her life
[25:34] was her testimony
[25:37] he said there was something about that
[25:38] woman that was something different about
[25:40] her
[25:42] and he said you know what it began to
[25:44] create a thirst in him
[25:46] it created a desire in him until he got
[25:49] to the place he had to go talk to that
[25:50] woman to find out what is it that makes
[25:52] you different
[25:54] and he said that's how his dad got saved
[25:57] was because he saw it wasn't just just
[26:00] you know just anybody but it was
[26:02] something about this one why because
[26:04] God was there because she was a
[26:07] Christian the love of God was being
[26:09] manifested the Life of Christ was being
[26:10] manifest and when you see how those
[26:14] things begin to be brought out then
[26:17] that's the same thing with you and I
[26:19] it's it should be us
[26:22] when as the song says you know
[26:25] uh I I love this song and it says when
[26:28] they looked they beheld him
[26:31] when I spoke they could hear him when I
[26:34] walked my every footstep brought them
[26:37] all to Calvary
[26:39] if if our if our life doesn't match that
[26:43] if if people can't see Jesus Christ then
[26:45] you know what we need we need to get in
[26:47] the altar
[26:49] because every that's our goal in life
[26:51] not to how much money we can make or or
[26:53] all these type things but can the world
[26:55] see Jesus Christ in US
[26:59] can the world see who who Christ is that
[27:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:03] forever
[27:07] but you know when when you begin to walk
[27:10] in this journey you know God's going to
[27:11] bring you somebody and you're going to
[27:13] continue to walk well then you know what
[27:14] you don't look at all the the peripheral
[27:16] things you lay all that aside
[27:19] and you put your faith and trust in God
[27:22] and God begins to walk with you and he
[27:24] begins to deal with you
[27:27] and you know that and it doesn't matter
[27:28] because he is the one that's overcome
[27:31] says he overcome the world
[27:34] everything in the world he's overcome
[27:38] and so when when he begins to lead us
[27:41] and guide us then you know what we have
[27:43] the same opportunity to overcome
[27:45] everything
[27:47] we don't have to hold on to the Past
[27:51] we don't have to hold on to things that
[27:54] hold us back
[27:56] but we can move on
[27:59] because you know what God is a god of
[28:01] Deliverance
[28:03] God is a god of Miracles
[28:07] because the Bible is full of Miracles
[28:09] and you know what he's the same
[28:10] yesterday today and forever so if he's
[28:12] ever done a miracle then you know what
[28:13] he's still the same
[28:16] and if anybody has ever been saved if
[28:19] anybody has ever been delivered and any
[28:21] time in point in history
[28:24] if you make the same conditions then
[28:27] he's obligated to do the same thing
[28:31] because brother Brown says he's not a
[28:34] respecter of persons but he is a
[28:36] respecter of faith
[28:39] God respects faith
[28:41] and that's what causes God to move
[28:44] is faith
[28:48] but see when the children of Israel when
[28:50] they begin to walk they begin to look at
[28:51] all the things that were all around them
[28:55] that when the children of Israel when
[28:57] God sent Moses down there sent a prophet
[29:00] with a message who was Vindicated to
[29:02] bring them out
[29:03] everything that they had neither was
[29:05] given to him but the problem is is they
[29:07] they didn't walk by faith
[29:10] they began to walk and then all of a
[29:12] sudden they had all the issues that they
[29:14] saw all around them but they didn't say
[29:16] that God was there leading them that God
[29:19] spoke to them
[29:21] and when you when you began to say how
[29:23] we were speaking last time when when
[29:25] they the children of Israel began to see
[29:27] all the things that they had went
[29:29] through God delivered them all the way
[29:32] they fed them to clothe them all the
[29:34] Miracles that took place
[29:36] when the greatest the greatest Empire
[29:38] when the greatest nation in all the
[29:40] world was tore up and and destroyed and
[29:42] collapsed in front of their eyes when
[29:46] they had seen all those miracles
[29:48] and then when they came out and they
[29:50] complained and God parted the Red Sea
[29:52] and they walked across on dry land all
[29:54] the way that they had led all the
[29:56] Miracles they took place and they stood
[29:58] there and couldn't believe that God well
[29:59] I don't know if God can do this or not
[30:01] he brought them all this way and he kept
[30:03] showing them that he's the god of
[30:04] Miracles that he was gonna that he was
[30:06] going to lead them
[30:08] and every time that was a problem you
[30:10] know what he he overlooked their
[30:12] unbelief and he brought them forward
[30:15] until they came to kadish Barney
[30:18] after he brought him all of that way
[30:20] until they came to the Judgment seat the
[30:22] Judgment seat of God and then he
[30:24] couldn't Overlook their their sin
[30:26] anymore they had to believe and it come
[30:28] to the place they had to agree with the
[30:29] word and they had to take it by faith
[30:33] and many times it comes to the same
[30:35] thing you and I we've got to come to a
[30:36] place that we've got to sell out to to
[30:38] this word and there's nothing else in
[30:40] this world we've got to lay everything
[30:41] else aside lay every weight and every
[30:44] sin aside and sell out to nothing but
[30:46] this word and have our complete
[30:48] confidence in God and His word that he's
[30:50] going to lead us through
[30:58] but we have to believe what God Said
[31:01] he said he
[31:03] he said he God honors believers
[31:07] and even even when people
[31:11] don't know which way to go and sometimes
[31:13] sometimes we take the wrong road
[31:18] sometimes we do do the wrong thing
[31:21] because you know what sometimes we're
[31:22] ignorant
[31:25] how many times have we done things and
[31:27] it's like well I thought this was right
[31:30] and we're just doing the best we can
[31:36] as brother Brown talked about those
[31:38] those people going out
[31:40] they went to totem poles and witches and
[31:43] everything else and God honored their
[31:44] faith
[31:46] why because they followed what they
[31:48] that's all they knew
[31:49] and they walked in and God honored their
[31:51] faith
[31:53] well you know sometimes we we believe
[31:55] things that were wrong
[31:57] you know some of us some of us believed
[32:00] in the Trinity and different things
[32:03] there's a lot of things that that we
[32:05] didn't that well we didn't agree you
[32:06] know didn't see
[32:08] but you know what it was God's grace
[32:10] that kept leading us and there would
[32:12] come a time in our life that he began to
[32:13] deal with us and show us what the truth
[32:15] was
[32:17] and then he began to show oh I see that
[32:20] well you know what that that makes sense
[32:24] and then all of a sudden when it begins
[32:25] to open up then you know I can walk in
[32:27] that
[32:27] and you know when when it begins to oh
[32:29] the word begins to open up it's like hey
[32:31] I can rejoice in that because I can see
[32:32] that that makes sense
[32:35] and then there's more to go and then all
[32:37] of a sudden the more you go and the more
[32:38] you feed then there's more to open up
[32:42] and sometimes sometimes you the word
[32:44] will begin to open up to you one little
[32:46] thing will open up and then sometimes
[32:48] the Lord don't speak to you for a while
[32:50] why because he's going to see what
[32:52] you're going to do
[32:55] you know many times as I I was speaking
[32:59] you know when when different things
[33:01] happen and we see why things go certain
[33:04] ways and we don't understand it you know
[33:06] just like Elijah's sitting there at the
[33:08] brook Sheriff you know when when all the
[33:10] famine and all the things was going on
[33:12] God had a place for his Prophet to go to
[33:16] and it's it's interesting when you read
[33:18] that story The widow woman's down there
[33:20] going and starving to death
[33:23] just trying to make it with what little
[33:25] bit she's got
[33:26] and you know when she when she's in
[33:28] there and there's no rain in the land
[33:30] and you can see all the death and
[33:33] destruction all around there there's no
[33:35] rain there's no Earth and everything's
[33:37] drying up there's death all around all
[33:39] the things that she was she saw
[33:42] and you know what it began to weigh on
[33:44] her that you know what that's what that
[33:46] was her path that's exactly the way she
[33:49] that was inevitable for her she was
[33:51] going to die also
[33:54] she didn't have any she didn't have any
[33:55] water everything was drying up
[33:58] and it was and she's sitting there every
[34:00] single day looking in that Mill barrel
[34:02] and it's just her and her son
[34:05] but you know what the prophet was off
[34:07] somewhere by a a creek by the Brook and
[34:11] he's he's eating and drinking and having
[34:13] having a great time
[34:16] now the Lord the Lord supernaturally
[34:18] feeding him he's he's got water
[34:21] and he's enjoying himself
[34:25] and sometimes in our lives we wonder why
[34:27] and sometimes you know it's we're like
[34:29] the widow woman or sometimes we're like
[34:31] Elijah
[34:33] you know there's times that God brings
[34:34] us into places and it's like we're just
[34:37] there
[34:38] and sometimes we we begin to see the
[34:40] situation that we're in and not
[34:42] realizing God's got us in a place that
[34:44] he wants to feed you he wants to water
[34:46] you he wants to comfort you he wants to
[34:49] arrest you
[34:51] but sometimes we get we get anxious in
[34:53] those places why we said we don't see
[34:55] the Lord moving we don't but you know
[34:57] what sometimes the Lord has to open our
[34:59] eyes and realize hey God
[35:01] because you know there's been times in
[35:03] my life when when things have happened
[35:04] and people you know you wonder what's
[35:07] going on and how things are going it's
[35:09] like well sometimes this may be the
[35:10] brook cherith we're just sitting here
[35:12] waiting on God
[35:14] so I'm just going to look and I'm not
[35:16] because I'm not going to get anxious
[35:17] about it
[35:20] because sometimes and and you look back
[35:22] over your life and sometimes when you go
[35:25] through situations in your life and and
[35:27] things and it looks bad and and you get
[35:29] worked up and you know what realize
[35:31] God's on the scene
[35:32] and God's working but you don't see that
[35:36] but you're but you'll get worked up and
[35:38] you'll be anxious and and you'll get
[35:40] nervous and you'll worry about things
[35:41] and you know what not realizing later
[35:43] when you look back you know God had it
[35:44] all under control
[35:47] but we didn't have faith in God to
[35:49] realize that we were sitting in a place
[35:50] that God wanted us to be
[35:53] but you know there was that widow woman
[35:55] sitting down there the whole time
[35:57] and God knew what what she was going
[36:00] through
[36:01] God knew what she was facing that she
[36:03] was down there in the midst of all of
[36:05] that death and destruction and what she
[36:06] was facing
[36:08] but you know when it came the appointed
[36:10] time he sent the prophet to her and he
[36:13] gave her a word
[36:15] and not only did he just speak the word
[36:17] to her but he gave her something to do
[36:20] so when he when he spoke to the the
[36:22] widow woman you know then he come down
[36:24] there and said give me a drink
[36:26] well that wasn't that wasn't a problem
[36:27] to give him a drink the problem was she
[36:30] had a little bit of a problem when she
[36:31] was going to have to get in that milk
[36:32] barrel and give him a little bit of some
[36:34] bread
[36:37] it's like listen I you know we're
[36:38] running out down here I don't know if
[36:40] you know we're in a famine
[36:44] but you know in the midst of that God
[36:46] God through the prophet told her said
[36:48] listen just make me a little one first
[36:51] hate him on all of it
[36:53] he just wanted her to have faith
[36:56] and uh and work
[36:59] and and so move forward in that brother
[37:02] Brian said you've got to do something
[37:03] for God to honor
[37:05] and so when you do something what she
[37:07] does she made that cake and she give it
[37:10] to him
[37:12] then what it then what Elijah tell her
[37:14] said listen it's never going to run out
[37:17] in the midst of all of this drought and
[37:19] all of this it's never gonna run out
[37:21] you're never going to you're never gonna
[37:22] go dry you're always going to have it
[37:27] just by following what God wants you to
[37:29] do
[37:30] right and it's the same way with you and
[37:32] I
[37:34] you know if we put our faith and our
[37:36] confidence in God you know we always go
[37:38] and God always has something for us
[37:40] not to worry and and fret and and all
[37:44] these things but just put our trust in
[37:45] God and then all of a sudden when he
[37:47] come to that place that she gave them
[37:49] you know what she always had
[37:51] just by her little portion
[37:53] have faith to give
[37:58] it so when we have that when God calls
[38:01] us into those places and into whatever
[38:03] situation is if we can just put our
[38:06] trust in God and do what God wants us to
[38:09] do how how small or how how looming or
[38:13] large it seems sometimes but you know if
[38:15] you just honor God with what God has
[38:18] asked of you
[38:21] and you know I was thinking about where
[38:23] brother Brown was talking about the
[38:27] children
[38:28] the uh over season you know he was
[38:30] talking about the all those people
[38:32] coming and you know they had a desire
[38:35] to see and hear just one word from God
[38:40] and all and all those Stone you know the
[38:42] storms and different things like that
[38:43] and he was talking about you know
[38:45] as the story I was telling last last
[38:47] week
[38:49] you know here they are in those in those
[38:51] storms and and the Heat and all that
[38:53] kind of stuff and he said they just want
[38:54] to hear one word from God
[38:56] and they went through all of that to go
[38:58] stand there spent all day standing in
[39:00] the hot sun or braving rain storms or
[39:03] whatever it is just to stand there just
[39:05] for brother Branham to come and say and
[39:07] just speak one word from God
[39:10] piled up just stacked up the sick people
[39:13] and everything why because they just
[39:14] knew that if he had just come
[39:18] then they were expecting something from
[39:19] God
[39:22] and it's the same it's the same thing
[39:23] you know you know no matter how bad the
[39:26] storm gets
[39:27] no matter how many the problems get
[39:29] whatever it may be that we come through
[39:31] in our lives if we can just if we can
[39:33] just continue to do just like they done
[39:37] because you know it
[39:41] like brother Wade's always said you know
[39:43] you see people when when they have
[39:44] problems hit their lives and they have
[39:46] troubles and and different trials and
[39:48] different things like that the first
[39:49] thing they do is they leave church
[39:53] when when those things happen no when
[39:56] when the problems get to the point where
[39:58] you get it feels like you can't make it
[40:00] and it become unbearable that's the time
[40:02] you need to be in church
[40:04] you don't need to be away from church
[40:06] you need to be in church
[40:09] how many how many times have you been in
[40:12] and just from your own personal
[40:13] experience I know for me but how many
[40:15] times have you been where you you either
[40:17] you're so sick that you you that you
[40:20] just don't feel you just don't feel like
[40:21] you can make it through the door or you
[40:23] whatever the problem you've got so many
[40:24] problems that that you're burdened with
[40:26] something or you know you're just
[40:28] frustrated whatever it is that you're
[40:30] facing and you're and you come to the
[40:32] house of God and you're just you're just
[40:34] so tore down with everything all this is
[40:37] upon you and when you come in the house
[40:40] of God the first thing that whatever is
[40:42] said
[40:43] sometimes it's a song that are sunk when
[40:46] they begin to sing the songs of Zion all
[40:48] of a sudden something changes inside of
[40:50] you and it begins to speak to you and to
[40:52] speak to your situation and you know you
[40:55] know what you've been blessed just to be
[40:56] in the house of God just walk through
[40:58] the door and sing the songs and the word
[40:59] ain't even preached you ain't even heard
[41:02] the word but something begins why
[41:04] because you're in the atmosphere and
[41:06] it's soon because when you begin to
[41:08] worship God and you get into that
[41:09] atmosphere then God can come and speak
[41:11] to you but the problem is is you get in
[41:13] the wrong atmosphere and you get
[41:15] weighted down then you can't God can't
[41:17] deal with you
[41:19] but all of a sudden you get in the house
[41:21] of God and all of a sudden the songs
[41:22] begin to sing and you can you can be mad
[41:25] you can be sad whatever it may be but
[41:27] you get into the presence of God and he
[41:28] you begin to sing
[41:31] then all of a sudden something begins to
[41:33] change inside of you and and sometimes
[41:35] you may you may not even make it through
[41:37] the song service
[41:40] I know I I know I've led singing before
[41:42] and it's like the first song the second
[41:44] song the third song and I mean it's just
[41:47] like you're fighting a battle the whole
[41:48] time it's like trying to push a great
[41:50] weight up a hill
[41:53] and he's like well you know what I could
[41:55] just quit
[41:56] but you know what it's you just continue
[41:58] to press
[42:02] and you continue to press and all of a
[42:04] sudden as you keep on just worshiping
[42:06] the Lord and you keep going because
[42:07] sometimes sometimes it's uh you know for
[42:10] those who've ever led singing sometimes
[42:12] it's a wonderful experience I mean the
[42:14] presence of the Lord drops down and it's
[42:16] like you could sing all night long it's
[42:17] just wonderful and other times you're
[42:19] fighting a battle up here
[42:21] and you're just really it's just like a
[42:23] but you know sometimes all of a sudden
[42:25] you just keep pressing press and
[42:26] pressing and all of a sudden you break
[42:28] through and all of a sudden then you
[42:30] realize that whatever whatever was
[42:32] holding the spirit back in the service
[42:34] whatever it was it breaks and all of a
[42:36] sudden then the presence the Lord begins
[42:38] to move in this in the church why
[42:40] because you know what as the old saying
[42:42] there is a blessing and pressing
[42:44] because if you begin to press your way
[42:47] in because you have to press your way
[42:48] into the kingdom of God if you begin to
[42:50] press and all of a sudden you're going
[42:52] to get a blessing because all of a
[42:53] sudden you're going to overcome that
[42:57] you just keep pressing you keep pressing
[42:59] you get into that
[43:01] it's the same way sometimes the same way
[43:04] we're preaching
[43:06] sometimes when you start out it's like
[43:08] you're trying it's sometimes it's a real
[43:10] struggle it's really hard
[43:13] but you know what you just keep on
[43:15] because it's not me I'm not trying to
[43:17] preach
[43:19] it's yielding myself
[43:21] and if I can just get myself out of the
[43:23] way that he can preach
[43:26] and you operate the gift
[43:30] because sometimes you know it's not just
[43:32] looking at who's up here
[43:35] because if we didn't see if we didn't
[43:37] see a vessel up here if we just realize
[43:39] it's God speaking
[43:42] it doesn't matter if if the person was
[43:44] illiterate
[43:47] didn't matter who they were
[43:49] because you know Peter and John were
[43:51] ignorant and unlearned but you know what
[43:52] they knew that they hadn't experienced
[43:54] because they had knew they had been with
[43:55] Jesus they had had an experience in
[43:58] their life that changed who they were
[44:07] now
[44:09] this is um Hebrews
[44:12] 4 verses 1 and 2 says let us therefore
[44:15] fear lest the promise being left us
[44:18] of entering into his rest any of you
[44:20] should
[44:21] seem to come short of it for unto us was
[44:24] the Gospel preached as well as unto them
[44:27] but the word preached did not profit
[44:29] them not being Faith mixed with faith in
[44:33] them that heard it
[44:35] so it takes because we have to have just
[44:37] like them the word was preached but they
[44:39] did not mix it with faith when they what
[44:42] they heard they did not follow
[44:45] because God was going to lead them and
[44:47] all the time God kept proving to them
[44:49] that he was leading them and yet they
[44:51] did not mix it with faith
[44:53] and it's the same way with you and I if
[44:55] we want to enter in then we've got to
[44:57] mix it with faith
[45:01] and from Jehovah Jireh above says let me
[45:03] give you a scripture first see
[45:05] with what we do it must be scriptural
[45:07] got to be scriptural God won't honor
[45:10] nothing else God won't honor a lie you
[45:12] know that
[45:13] you couldn't attach that to him he don't
[45:16] honor lives he only honors his word but
[45:18] he promised that my word will not return
[45:20] to me voice it'll accomplish that which
[45:22] it was purpose for and we say the word
[45:25] that's lauded today no matter how much
[45:28] unbelief rises in the camp
[45:30] God will honor his word when he find
[45:34] Faith to honor it by
[45:36] so when to have faith to believe what
[45:38] God says then he will honor our faith
[45:40] but that's what we got to have we got to
[45:42] believe what God told us what God has
[45:44] said and then we then God will honor
[45:46] that all the way through if we take it
[45:48] and mix it with faith believe what God
[45:50] has said
[45:51] it's always been the same way this is
[45:53] from the permanent Church age there
[45:56] he said he said with so many dishonoring
[45:59] God turning him into three gods and
[46:00] changing his gracious name to titles he
[46:03] said one would wonder if the signs and
[46:04] wonders that attend such a great name
[46:06] would still be visited among the people
[46:08] and did those peop those signs were
[46:10] mightily and wonderfully manifested
[46:12] through certainly not in the false Vine
[46:14] he said men like Martin were greatly
[46:15] used of God and bore them witness both
[46:18] by signs and wonders and Gifts of the
[46:20] Holy Ghost the name was still effectual
[46:22] as it always has been and ever will be
[46:25] where the Saints honor him through his
[46:28] word and Faith so as long as we have see
[46:31] we've got to take the only thing that
[46:33] God's going to honor is his faith and
[46:34] you have faith in God's word then he
[46:36] will do what he said he's going to do
[46:37] but you've got to continue to follow in
[46:39] what he said
[46:41] and all the all the things through the
[46:42] scriptures that we look at it's them
[46:44] taking what God had said and then when
[46:47] he when they take it what God had said
[46:49] then we see the Miracles take place we
[46:52] see the things that take place brother
[46:53] Brown speaking later on he was uh
[46:57] talking about Paul and you know he said
[46:59] it was the people that had faith in what
[47:01] Paul's bought in the aprons and the
[47:04] things the handkerchiefs that were taken
[47:06] it was their faith in God that it wasn't
[47:10] Paul that was able to do Miracles but it
[47:12] was their faith in God through Paul that
[47:14] they could lay in the in the in the
[47:16] shadow of Peter it wasn't it wasn't
[47:18] Peter that they had faith in it was God
[47:20] that they saw God in Peter that they
[47:24] could lay in the shadows of them and
[47:25] they took those aprons from the body of
[47:28] Paul and those unclean spirits went out
[47:30] why because they had faith in God the
[47:32] the faith that that the god that Paul
[47:35] preached they had faith in that to
[47:38] believe that they could take that from
[47:39] him and they could they could have the
[47:41] Miracles take place the the healings and
[47:43] different things that were taking place
[47:45] that come through that why because they
[47:47] had faith in God by by what they had
[47:51] seen and it wasn't who you know
[47:54] because you know you they had to get
[47:56] past who Paul was
[48:00] you know it was like you know some
[48:02] people go out there
[48:04] you know you still got blood on your
[48:06] hands
[48:08] someplace somebody had to get past that
[48:12] they had to get past the point of what
[48:14] Paul was you know when he was saw what
[48:17] he done in the past
[48:18] when he began to talk about you know all
[48:20] the things I was a blasphemer but I'd
[48:22] done it in ignorance
[48:24] all the things that he was talking about
[48:25] all the things that he had done in his
[48:26] life I'm the least in the Kingdom
[48:30] because I persecuted the church
[48:34] but you know he said but it was God's
[48:36] grace to me that I could be where I'm at
[48:38] today
[48:41] and when he begins to talk about those
[48:43] things and he said and he talks about
[48:45] all the things that have went through
[48:46] all all the murderers and all the things
[48:48] that that had taken place and he said
[48:50] such were some of you
[48:52] when he began to talk about you know but
[48:54] now you're clean now you're Justified
[48:56] why because all those things have been
[48:58] put away by the washing of the water of
[49:01] the word all those things have cleaned
[49:02] you you know you don't have to hold on
[49:04] to those things anymore
[49:06] you know I'd like you said you know he
[49:07] said now he said laying aside all these
[49:09] things he said I pressed toward the Mark
[49:11] I've got to lay all these things aside
[49:13] and that's the same way with you and I
[49:15] we can always
[49:16] you know there's many people in this
[49:18] world and and they get offended one time
[49:20] in their life or or whatever something
[49:22] something comes up and you know they'll
[49:24] never get past that
[49:25] they hold on to that for the rest of
[49:28] their life
[49:29] you'll never grow as a Christian holding
[49:31] on trying to hold grudges and hold on to
[49:34] what took place years ago you'll never
[49:36] get past that you got to lay it all
[49:38] aside
[49:39] why because you know you know as as
[49:41] Christians our goal is to make sure that
[49:44] everybody makes it
[49:47] he's like well you know what
[49:49] you just wait
[49:51] we're going to get to the Great White
[49:53] throne and I'm gonna make sure you go to
[49:54] hell
[49:58] because you know I got I got that
[50:00] well guess what you know what
[50:04] um I wouldn't back my
[50:06] Bank on going to heaven
[50:08] you may be over there waiting somebody
[50:12] stand at the white Throne trying to get
[50:14] mercy and Grace
[50:16] hey man
[50:19] because you know that's not that's not
[50:20] the life of God
[50:22] that's not the spirit of God
[50:25] to have it to have any but that's the
[50:27] way some people are
[50:29] you know you know as brother Brown said
[50:32] you know our desire is that I'll make it
[50:37] the scripture says that God was willing
[50:39] that none should perish
[50:41] but that all might come to repentance
[50:46] and so it's always as brother Branham
[50:48] said you know when when they care they
[50:49] said well brother Bradham we don't agree
[50:51] with your Doctrine and we don't agree
[50:52] with this and we're just going to draw
[50:54] you outside of our Circle because we
[50:55] don't want you
[50:58] well brother Brown said well don't worry
[50:59] brother I love you anyway and I'm gonna
[51:01] draw you back in
[51:04] because guess what
[51:06] you can draw your circle and I can draw
[51:07] a bigger Circle
[51:11] and if you you draw me out again I can
[51:13] just draw a bigger Circle
[51:16] you can't draw me out
[51:19] because there's one thing there's one
[51:20] thing about it
[51:22] brother talking about you know there's
[51:24] one you you can do something to me
[51:29] but you know you can't whatever you do
[51:32] the way I react to it
[51:34] is the way I react to it and you can't
[51:37] control that
[51:40] so if if you do something to me and you
[51:42] offend me then you know what I can
[51:44] forgive you and love you anyway
[51:45] and guess what you can't stop me from
[51:47] doing that
[51:50] [Applause]
[51:56] because you know what you can you can do
[51:57] whatever and and but you can't stop what
[52:00] I do
[52:02] because that's what that's the way
[52:04] that's the way that God is
[52:06] that's the way that's the way the word
[52:08] is because you know he's always reaching
[52:11] out
[52:13] and he's going to reach out because you
[52:15] know he's always reaching out until
[52:16] there's there's no until you're cut off
[52:19] but it's not God cutting you off
[52:22] you sent away your day of Grace you cut
[52:25] him off
[52:28] when Cain when Cain come before God and
[52:31] God began to speak to Cain he had to
[52:33] access God made a way for him and told
[52:36] him which way to go
[52:38] light it out perfectly for him but you
[52:40] know what it was it was Kane's decision
[52:42] not to follow God's word
[52:45] so when he decided hey I'm not going to
[52:48] do what you say I'm gonna do my own
[52:50] thing
[52:51] the you know what that was his choice
[52:52] God didn't cut him off
[52:55] and you know and if God didn't make a
[52:57] way for Cain to come if he said listen
[53:01] he said if you do as your brother he
[53:02] said you'll be accepted if he didn't if
[53:04] he didn't believe that and he didn't say
[53:06] was not honest when he said that can you
[53:09] imagine God's a liar
[53:12] he said well you know God could you know
[53:15] no it wasn't God cutting cane off can't
[53:19] cut himself off
[53:21] and it's the same way with you and I
[53:23] he's made the way and but you've got to
[53:25] turn it down
[53:27] brother Bradham said we fight our way
[53:29] all the way to hell
[53:33] you got to step he said you got to step
[53:35] over the blood of Jesus Christ to get to
[53:37] hell
[53:39] that's a that's a that's a powerful
[53:41] statement I gotta fight my way I got a
[53:44] struggle and I've got to work my way
[53:46] into hell
[53:49] because why because he's made a way and
[53:51] he stand there and he's trying to reach
[53:53] out to you but you know what I'm gonna
[53:54] if I'm you know it's not like you just
[53:56] on a slippery slope
[53:59] not like everybody says well you know
[54:01] God's got you roasting over hell like a
[54:03] on a hot dog like oh no string
[54:08] he just barely got you dangling over
[54:10] hell you know you just buy this little
[54:12] string and you know you're just ready to
[54:14] he's ready to throw you in the fire
[54:19] where everybody's like you know you got
[54:21] this big God he's got this great big
[54:23] hammer over top of your head and he's
[54:25] just waiting for you to mess up saying
[54:26] whack you in the head
[54:29] he just walks around like this just
[54:34] but you know what as as brother Dale
[54:35] always said you if you understand God
[54:38] and you understand who he is you realize
[54:40] he said he chastens he corrects with
[54:44] nail print hands
[54:46] nail scarred hands
[54:49] you know God is so loving and kind but
[54:54] he's a just God
[54:56] but you know what he has a way for you
[54:59] but you know you turn it down
[55:02] and he oh and so many times we we have
[55:04] fallen and failed and and we have come
[55:07] short but you know what God is always
[55:09] there to bring us back he's always there
[55:12] to bring us back and show us the way to
[55:14] come but you know you've got to come
[55:16] that way
[55:20] and this is from the message expectation
[55:22] he says now just believe him tonight and
[55:26] he will do the same way
[55:28] for he's no respect of persons he's
[55:30] respecting Faith he said God will honor
[55:33] Faith even your salvation sometimes
[55:35] won't atone for your healing not the
[55:38] merits of your salvation you're not
[55:40] healed by that you're healed by the
[55:42] Merit of your faith he said I've seen
[55:44] Christians come to the platform renowned
[55:47] Christians and fail to get healed and
[55:49] see a prostitute walk on the platform be
[55:51] healed instantly see because the
[55:52] Christian had been drugged through of
[55:55] many places and skeptic kind of
[55:56] believing wonder if the days of Miracles
[55:58] has passed and they'll go off missing it
[56:01] and a poor old prostitute come to the
[56:03] platform knowing that she's guilty
[56:05] condemned before God and their Giver
[56:07] heart to Christ and be healed instantly
[56:09] and just walk away so it's on the Merit
[56:11] of your faith look in the times of Jesus
[56:14] how the Pharisees and Sadducees they
[56:16] walked by and doubted and the street
[56:18] women and so forth of that day and so
[56:20] forth and the Beggars and things would
[56:22] be healed where many of the others
[56:24] didn't get healed see it was on the
[56:26] merits of your faith so it's just so
[56:29] simple how things and not why because
[56:32] the people that when they walked before
[56:34] Jesus they didn't worry about what they
[56:37] had done because they realized who they
[56:38] were
[56:41] they realize who they were because they
[56:43] didn't have their own uh self-evaluation
[56:47] that that you know they were so good
[56:49] because when they realized God is
[56:51] greater than who I am
[56:53] when they walked before Jesus you know
[56:55] and realize hey I'm I'm worthless I'm
[56:58] I'm I don't have anything I'm not good
[57:01] enough
[57:02] but you know what he's greater than that
[57:05] he's great so that I can put my
[57:06] confidence in him not at not looking at
[57:09] the things that of of my life or the
[57:11] things I've done but realize he's
[57:13] greater than that
[57:14] and then when that when they come by
[57:16] then he could that he can do something
[57:17] for them
[57:19] that I'm not trying to
[57:21] do it by my own by my own merits
[57:24] but realizing who he is
[57:33] and this is from the
[57:35] Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and
[57:37] forever
[57:39] he was talking about the prayer lines he
[57:41] says then he says as soon as the Holy
[57:44] Spirit starts to work as many of you've
[57:47] been in the meetings well then it moves
[57:48] to the audience everywhere to where the
[57:50] people are that sick and Afflicted
[57:52] they're healed he said by their own
[57:55] personal faith in Christ nothing I have
[57:57] in myself to do it I'm just your brother
[58:00] that's all he said but Christ their
[58:03] faith in Christ does the healing and
[58:05] they said and now each evening talks
[58:07] about them passing out the prayer cards
[58:11] get them out every day fresh and then
[58:13] sometimes when we get a lot of cards out
[58:15] we'll have a line get our ministering
[58:17] Brethren to line up lines and pray for
[58:19] the sick all of them he said we take up
[58:22] the cards and just show you that God
[58:24] hears any Minister's prayer anybody's
[58:26] prayer don't have to be a minister you
[58:29] can pray for the sick God will honor
[58:30] your prayer see what is it it is it a
[58:33] faith in the finished work of the Lord
[58:36] Jesus
[58:37] so if you just have faith because
[58:39] whatever he's done it's a finished work
[58:41] it's finished and if you just put Faith
[58:43] in what God has already done what he's
[58:45] already said
[58:47] many times when I as I've said before
[58:49] when I pray for people it's a finished
[58:51] work
[58:53] I thank the Lord you know I pray over
[58:54] somebody and say thank the Lord because
[58:55] it's a finished work I all I'm doing is
[58:58] is doing what he said lay hands on
[59:00] people
[59:03] I'm just fulfilling the scripture but
[59:04] he's already done the healing he's
[59:06] already done the delivery he's already
[59:09] done whatever you have need of whatever
[59:11] you come for it and when you've prayed
[59:13] for somebody and you and you agree with
[59:15] somebody touching anything it's already
[59:17] done
[59:19] I'm just agreeing with you
[59:22] then if and if then if it doesn't take
[59:24] place then you know we need to stop and
[59:26] find out what the problem is
[59:28] why is it why is it that we've not had
[59:31] the the Deliverance or the healing or
[59:33] whatever it is that takes place
[59:36] why because there's something wrong in
[59:38] the body
[59:39] there's something wrong that if we don't
[59:40] if we if we if somebody comes up here
[59:43] and doesn't get healed then what is it
[59:46] then there's something there's some kind
[59:48] of problem
[59:51] then it should have we should be in
[59:53] desperation
[59:55] his brother Branham said
[1:00:00] here's a
[1:00:01] first John
[1:00:03] chapter 2
[1:00:05] and it says but whosoever keepeth his
[1:00:09] word in him verily is the love of God
[1:00:10] perfected hereby know we that we are in
[1:00:14] him
[1:00:15] he that saith he abideth in him ought
[1:00:17] himself also to work even as he walked
[1:00:22] now brother random speaking in in the uh
[1:00:25] message the perfect Faith he begins to
[1:00:28] talk he said when when Satan tempts us
[1:00:29] we are to resist him in a perfect faith
[1:00:32] in a perfect word like Jesus did he said
[1:00:35] the word of God is perfect we're to have
[1:00:39] perfect faith in this perfect word and
[1:00:41] resist Satan
[1:00:43] and he continues he said by his faith
[1:00:45] and his word it conquers we can conquer
[1:00:47] anything both death hell and the grave
[1:00:49] we know that God is God what that
[1:00:52] perfect faith in God's perfect word he
[1:00:54] conquered everything he came in contact
[1:00:56] with God could not death could not even
[1:00:59] stand in his presence could not uh
[1:01:02] sickness could not stand in his presence
[1:01:04] but then he continues to drop down he
[1:01:06] said there he was walking walking in a
[1:01:09] world with perfect Faith because he was
[1:01:13] the word he said and now he said if ye
[1:01:16] abide in me through him
[1:01:20] he brought the word to you
[1:01:23] praise the Lord
[1:01:25] he brought the word to you if you abide
[1:01:28] in me he said in my words abide in you
[1:01:31] he said then walk in the same kind of a
[1:01:33] way
[1:01:34] virtues flowing from you the rivers of
[1:01:38] God's Fountains of blessings just
[1:01:40] flowing out of the people see what I
[1:01:43] mean and you're not bluffing it you're
[1:01:45] not imagine it it's actually taking
[1:01:49] place and you see it if you're just
[1:01:51] imagining that won't do any good but if
[1:01:54] it's really there it really happened
[1:01:58] and it's really amazing when you see
[1:02:00] that because if we understand
[1:02:03] see if you about he said if you abide in
[1:02:06] me and my words abide in you
[1:02:10] he said then you walk the same kind of
[1:02:12] walk that he walked that he had a place
[1:02:15] did he realized who he was
[1:02:17] and he walked in a in a path a perfect
[1:02:20] faith and a realm of perfect faith
[1:02:23] and realizing you know if if I'm in him
[1:02:26] then you know I'm not I'm not resting on
[1:02:28] me I'm not resting on my ideas I'm not
[1:02:30] resting on anything I've done but I
[1:02:33] realize that if I'm in him and he's in
[1:02:35] me that you know I could walk the same
[1:02:36] kind of walk
[1:02:39] oh well I don't know about that no it's
[1:02:43] true because that's what he's saying he
[1:02:45] said if you can see that he said you
[1:02:48] walk the same kind of walk the virtue's
[1:02:50] flowing from you
[1:02:52] why because that was that was Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ right there in the flesh the FL
[1:02:57] the virtues were coming out so he had
[1:02:59] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:03:01] patience all of those were in Jesus
[1:03:04] Christ being being made manifest
[1:03:07] and if it were and if you're in him then
[1:03:08] you know what you can have the same
[1:03:10] thing flowing out of you
[1:03:15] and he said you know because if
[1:03:17] something if you've got a if you've got
[1:03:19] something that's full of water and you
[1:03:21] put a crack in there you turn a a hose
[1:03:24] on or something like that you don't have
[1:03:26] to worry about trying you've never had
[1:03:27] to pull water out of anything
[1:03:31] I I've I've never had to pull water out
[1:03:34] of anything
[1:03:36] all that's doing is there and it's just
[1:03:38] looking for an Avenue to come out
[1:03:42] how many times some of y'all if you've
[1:03:44] ever worked in maintenance you'll know
[1:03:46] this brother boy don't know this you're
[1:03:48] working on something and you think you
[1:03:49] got it all under control and all of a
[1:03:51] sudden there's a pipe break and the next
[1:03:52] thing you know you get baptized standing
[1:03:54] up
[1:03:57] you think you think I've got this under
[1:03:59] control this is going to be all right
[1:04:01] well somehow it breaks loose and next
[1:04:03] thing you know sometimes it ain't always
[1:04:04] water but you get covered in something
[1:04:08] but you know what you don't ever ever
[1:04:10] have to try to coax it out
[1:04:13] you don't ever have to wait on them
[1:04:15] because you know what as soon as there
[1:04:16] is an Avenue for it to flow it's coming
[1:04:18] out
[1:04:19] and it's the same way with the Holy
[1:04:22] Spirit if the holy spirit is in us then
[1:04:24] you know we don't have to try to coax it
[1:04:27] out we don't have to try to pull that
[1:04:28] why because it flows out
[1:04:32] so that's the way it is he said say
[1:04:33] though it's a he said the rivers of
[1:04:35] God's Fountains of blessing just flowing
[1:04:38] out to the people
[1:04:40] now that's that's the kind of life that
[1:04:42] God has has promised us that's that's
[1:04:45] what he promised us that can be us
[1:04:50] not just no we're just waiting on
[1:04:52] brother Dale or brother Wade no every
[1:04:54] single person every believer
[1:04:58] every born-again believer has the same
[1:05:00] opportunity to have the virtues flowing
[1:05:02] out
[1:05:05] but it takes it's the same beginning
[1:05:07] it's the same faith that he walked in
[1:05:11] do we really if you are in him and he's
[1:05:14] in you and you abide in his words then
[1:05:16] that's what can take place see he said
[1:05:18] and you're not bluffing it you're not
[1:05:20] imagining it it actually taking place
[1:05:24] then you actually can't have those
[1:05:27] things
[1:05:30] it's not it's not just a hope so maybe
[1:05:32] so I think so you know no because it's
[1:05:35] something that's really truly happening
[1:05:41] now when when people see then you
[1:05:43] actually see these things take place
[1:05:52] if we because sometimes when we see
[1:05:55] those things it's like well I I don't
[1:05:57] know no
[1:06:00] if you get the first inkling in your
[1:06:02] mind that that well that's I don't know
[1:06:05] if you get a little bit of uncertainty
[1:06:07] in your mind
[1:06:09] then see that's the problem
[1:06:13] because when you begin to read the
[1:06:15] scripture and you begin to see those
[1:06:16] things and it it's it's to you
[1:06:19] and it's to flow out of you it's a
[1:06:22] promise
[1:06:23] and the first thing in my well you know
[1:06:25] I've done this and I've done that and
[1:06:27] you know and and then all of a sudden
[1:06:29] you start dealing in in the realm well
[1:06:31] that's one of the things that you've got
[1:06:32] to overcome
[1:06:34] you got to overcome your reasoning
[1:06:37] you've got to overcome your memory
[1:06:40] all those things why because those
[1:06:42] things are contrary to the law of God
[1:06:44] they're contrary to the word of God
[1:06:47] when he begins you know because as as as
[1:06:49] Hattie Wright was sitting there
[1:06:52] in the different ones but you know just
[1:06:53] like Hattie Wright was sitting there and
[1:06:55] when brother Brandon began to speak
[1:06:56] about those squirrels being being
[1:06:58] created and all those things and God
[1:07:00] began to speak to him
[1:07:02] why because he didn't understand the
[1:07:04] scripture because he had some kind of
[1:07:06] issue you know because I didn't
[1:07:07] understand he said if you say these
[1:07:09] mountains be moved and not doubt in your
[1:07:12] heart and he began to think about and
[1:07:14] God began to deal with him on the
[1:07:15] scripture
[1:07:16] and he began to meditate on the
[1:07:18] scripture on what the scripture says
[1:07:21] and then when the god began to speak to
[1:07:23] him and then he said you know you and
[1:07:24] you can speak squirrels they said you
[1:07:26] need some squirrels
[1:07:28] you need something to eat here how many
[1:07:31] squirrels do you want
[1:07:34] well you know it's like I I don't know
[1:07:37] about this God
[1:07:39] you know what brother Brandon didn't
[1:07:41] argue with God he didn't try to try to
[1:07:43] reason it out he was like okay
[1:07:47] and I'm just gonna walk forward I'm just
[1:07:49] you know how many how many do you need
[1:07:52] he said well three makes a good mess
[1:07:53] right
[1:07:55] so he began to speak about well there's
[1:07:56] three and he said where are they going
[1:07:58] to be at
[1:08:00] then you know what he didn't he didn't
[1:08:02] argue with God he didn't try to reason
[1:08:03] it out he just began to walk in what God
[1:08:06] was showing him and he began to say well
[1:08:07] I want one to appear there and appear
[1:08:10] there and appear there and then he you
[1:08:12] know as he began to walk he just he just
[1:08:14] started to walk in that
[1:08:16] in the spirit and they began to as the
[1:08:18] Lord began to speak to him and deal with
[1:08:20] him then he just kept moving forward and
[1:08:22] he said well this I want one here
[1:08:23] because this place you know you don't
[1:08:25] see squirrels over here like this I
[1:08:27] almost wanted to be there you know as he
[1:08:29] began to deal with that
[1:08:31] then he all of a sudden and then you
[1:08:33] know he had he shot what two of them
[1:08:34] then all of a sudden the Lord said I
[1:08:35] thought you said you wanted three
[1:08:38] so the Lord brought him back to that and
[1:08:40] he's like oh yeah that's right you did I
[1:08:41] did say three
[1:08:43] but God gave him those three
[1:08:47] but you know what he didn't he didn't
[1:08:48] try to figure out what was taking place
[1:08:51] just like when he was sitting there and
[1:08:53] he was talking to all those Brothers he
[1:08:55] said you know we don't try to figure out
[1:08:56] how Abraham got the RAM on the mountain
[1:08:59] when he wanted to slay Isaac when he was
[1:09:01] right there he said all of a sudden all
[1:09:03] we know is that he's Jehovah Jireh
[1:09:04] that's all we know and all of a sudden
[1:09:06] when he came to that place that had
[1:09:08] faith in God then he realized the lamb
[1:09:11] was there the ram was there for the
[1:09:13] sacrifice
[1:09:14] and when when sister had heard those and
[1:09:16] brother Byron began to speak on that
[1:09:18] just simple childlike faith and when she
[1:09:20] heard that he said that's nothing but
[1:09:22] the truth
[1:09:24] that she rose up in faith to hey that's
[1:09:27] for me I can see that nothing but the
[1:09:29] truth and now God honored her faith
[1:09:33] some poor literate woman but you know
[1:09:34] what God spoke and told the prophet give
[1:09:37] her what she had whatever she desires
[1:09:41] whatever you speak sister had as you
[1:09:43] said it whatever you speak you can have
[1:09:46] it's it like he said he said if you ask
[1:09:49] for a million dollars or whatever it is
[1:09:50] he said see if God doesn't come down and
[1:09:52] do it right now
[1:09:56] but you're so amazing because of all the
[1:09:58] things that sister Hattie could ask for
[1:10:02] a million dollars her sister is healing
[1:10:04] all the things that she could ask for in
[1:10:06] this world
[1:10:08] and the only thing that was more
[1:10:09] precious than anything in this whole
[1:10:11] wide world the only thing she wanted was
[1:10:13] the salvation of her sons
[1:10:16] why because God knew what she would ask
[1:10:18] for and that's right when he put it
[1:10:20] before he knew what she had asked for
[1:10:23] it and when she said I want the
[1:10:25] salvation of my children
[1:10:27] then you know what you can have it in
[1:10:29] the name of the Lord it belongs to you
[1:10:30] because you've asked
[1:10:33] what's the same thing when you come here
[1:10:34] what what have you he said whatever you
[1:10:37] ask when you desire whatever you desire
[1:10:38] When you pray he said believe and you
[1:10:41] shall have it
[1:10:43] but the question is is what do you
[1:10:45] believe what do you have faith to
[1:10:47] believe what do you what do you have
[1:10:48] need of what are you do whatever is it
[1:10:50] that you desire when you come to the
[1:10:52] house of God what is it that you have
[1:10:54] that you're Desiring tonight
[1:10:57] what is it that you stand here not and
[1:10:59] say well God is the same that he ever
[1:11:01] was will have ever if he's ever done
[1:11:04] anything in in the in the scripture
[1:11:06] we've ever seen God do anything that
[1:11:08] he's here tonight to do the same thing
[1:11:11] whether whether it's me or or brother
[1:11:14] Wade or brother
[1:11:15] Dale or brother Bob or whoever it is it
[1:11:18] doesn't really matter who the person is
[1:11:20] because you're not putting but we we can
[1:11:22] all gather but we're the representative
[1:11:24] because we're his hands and his feet
[1:11:26] here so we're just standing here in his
[1:11:29] place but we're just following what he
[1:11:31] said but he's the one that's going to do
[1:11:33] the work
[1:11:34] whatever you have need of he's here to
[1:11:36] meet the need
[1:11:37] but all you got to do is have faith in
[1:11:39] what God said you can trust him
[1:11:44] hey do we believe what God Said
[1:11:53] this is
[1:11:55] this is from the message faith is our
[1:11:57] victory
[1:12:02] he says
[1:12:03] he said you say John when he wrote that
[1:12:07] well 15.
[1:12:09] first 15 first John just scroll up there
[1:12:12] first John
[1:12:13] chapter 5 says whosoever believeth that
[1:12:16] Jesus is the Christ is born of God and
[1:12:18] everyone that loveth him that beget
[1:12:19] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[1:12:22] by this we know that we love the
[1:12:24] children of God when we love God and
[1:12:26] keep his Commandments for this is the
[1:12:28] love of God that we keep his
[1:12:29] Commandments and his Commandments are
[1:12:31] not Grievous for whatsoever is born of
[1:12:34] God overcometh the world and this is the
[1:12:36] victory that overcometh the world even
[1:12:38] our faith who is he that overcometh the
[1:12:41] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:12:43] is the son of God
[1:12:45] now continue on there and and faith is
[1:12:48] our Victory brother REM says so you say
[1:12:50] John when he wrote that he did not have
[1:12:53] he did not have my troubles
[1:12:56] he did not have to deal with the folk I
[1:12:59] have to deal with
[1:13:00] he did not have to go through the things
[1:13:02] that I do
[1:13:04] that's right
[1:13:06] he may not had to deal with the same
[1:13:08] folk he made I had to overcome the same
[1:13:11] thing but he never excluded them
[1:13:14] for he said this the faith is the
[1:13:16] victory that overcomes the world the
[1:13:18] whole thing he said how is it it's faith
[1:13:21] in it right above it when you have the
[1:13:24] written word of God laying before us and
[1:13:26] the Holy Spirit here performing and
[1:13:28] showing the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:13:30] with the Divine promises written here
[1:13:32] that whatsoever thing you desire When
[1:13:34] you pray believe you receive it and you
[1:13:36] shall have it what do you have to do
[1:13:39] then have faith not just floating faith
[1:13:42] not just a make-believe Faith but a real
[1:13:45] faith
[1:13:48] I used to continuing oh he says he says
[1:13:51] now Faith is a conqueror faith is an
[1:13:54] overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it
[1:13:58] overcomes faith is the victory that
[1:14:00] overcomes the world what does it do what
[1:14:02] is Faith what is the conquer conquer and
[1:14:05] victory is the same to conquer it means
[1:14:07] to beat down
[1:14:08] to override to handcuff to throw into
[1:14:11] prisons it means that the sin that once
[1:14:14] ruled you you roll it now it means that
[1:14:18] you have overcome it he said you've
[1:14:21] whipped it you're greater than it is
[1:14:24] he said oh I feel religious right now he
[1:14:27] said what was first a sin a sinner or a
[1:14:30] savior he's at a savior
[1:14:32] for a savior is more powerful than a sin
[1:14:35] which was first the Healer or sickness
[1:14:38] it couldn't be a Healer
[1:14:41] lest it was over the sickness It Is A
[1:14:45] Healer it could conquer the sickness and
[1:14:47] faith is the victory that overcomes
[1:14:48] Every curse of the devil faith is the
[1:14:51] victory
[1:14:52] he said faith in what not faith in your
[1:14:55] church not faith in a Creed not faith in
[1:14:57] some man but faith in Jesus Christ who
[1:15:00] made the promise
[1:15:01] that's the victory what is it it is the
[1:15:04] victory say my arm's still crampled my
[1:15:07] faith is the victory I still feel sick
[1:15:09] but faith is the victory oh it overcomes
[1:15:12] the world when you can climb into God by
[1:15:15] prayer until you've seen the thing
[1:15:17] conquered under you there is nothing
[1:15:20] that can hurt you you've overcome you've
[1:15:23] got 50 miles of Elbow Room
[1:15:26] you're selling free then
[1:15:30] Elbow Room why because when when you're
[1:15:33] under that weight and you're under that
[1:15:34] oppression then all of a sudden when you
[1:15:36] realize that you can come into God and
[1:15:38] all of a sudden you realize you've
[1:15:39] overcome through him whether it's moved
[1:15:42] or not you've already overcome it he
[1:15:44] said you've got 50 miles of Elbow Room
[1:15:46] well because you can feel all the
[1:15:48] freeness why because everything has
[1:15:50] moved back why because light has pushed
[1:15:52] back the darkness why because you've
[1:15:54] pushed back the powers of Satan so all
[1:15:56] of a sudden you've got room you've got
[1:15:58] room you feel like you can breathe
[1:16:01] and why we've overcome why because you
[1:16:04] have faith in him because we have faith
[1:16:06] in him that we've already overcome why
[1:16:08] because he's overcome
[1:16:10] that he's overcome
[1:16:13] and we're standing in him that we're
[1:16:14] Overcomers we're more than conquerors
[1:16:16] through him
[1:16:23] brother I was talking
[1:16:25] many people talk about having different
[1:16:27] you know oh I have this problem and I
[1:16:30] have that problem but if you have but if
[1:16:32] you have faith in what God said he said
[1:16:33] so what
[1:16:36] I still feel sick whatever so what
[1:16:40] if we're not putting our faith in all
[1:16:41] these things if we realize what God has
[1:16:43] done and we put our faith in it so what
[1:16:46] ever happens
[1:16:48] we don't be shaken by those things
[1:16:53] and this is from the message desperation
[1:16:56] I want to read this
[1:17:01] he says I I believe that the reason
[1:17:04] this is 24.
[1:17:06] the quote 24. he said I believe that the
[1:17:08] reason we don't have desperation is
[1:17:10] because it's a lack of love
[1:17:12] God the love of God I think that the
[1:17:15] love of God calls us desperation if God
[1:17:18] is in you the token inside of you and
[1:17:20] you see the conditions of times and
[1:17:23] people waiting in sin the way they are
[1:17:25] it'll throw you into desperation I
[1:17:27] believe it will he said now the word
[1:17:29] plain that states if you want to put
[1:17:31] this down Galatians 5 6 says that Faith
[1:17:34] worketh by love see Faith worketh by
[1:17:36] love and the only way that you can have
[1:17:39] faith is to have love first because
[1:17:41] after all faith is Love's incentive
[1:17:43] incentive that exactly what faith is
[1:17:47] it's an incentive to love now now you if
[1:17:51] you don't have love you can't have faith
[1:17:53] see
[1:17:54] he said how can you have faith and if
[1:17:56] you how can you have faith in your wife
[1:17:59] if you don't love her that's in philio
[1:18:02] now how about in Agape to God how can it
[1:18:05] be if you don't love God
[1:18:08] he said if you loved your wife and never
[1:18:10] tell her about it and never sat down to
[1:18:11] make love to her expressed it to her
[1:18:13] kiss her hug her and tell her she's the
[1:18:15] best cook in the country all the things
[1:18:16] that you know and how pretty she is and
[1:18:18] how much you love her if you don't do
[1:18:20] that she'll never know it that's the way
[1:18:22] if you do love her you express it he
[1:18:25] said that's the way we do to God if we
[1:18:27] love him tell him about it we sit down
[1:18:30] and we adore him and we worship him see
[1:18:32] love drives us to that
[1:18:36] and he's talking about if you're if your
[1:18:38] wife was sick
[1:18:40] you know you'd throw you into
[1:18:42] desperation if she had some kind of
[1:18:44] disease and he said that's the same way
[1:18:45] it the way it is we must have love
[1:18:48] before we can have faith and Faith when
[1:18:51] we have genuine love what does it do it
[1:18:53] pushes our faith out on the Battlefront
[1:18:56] for God see genuine Godly love for God
[1:18:59] and for his word and for his people will
[1:19:01] push Faith out there love just takes a
[1:19:04] hold of faith and says come on let's go
[1:19:06] and it goes and cause that's what love
[1:19:10] does
[1:19:11] John 14 23 says Jesus said if a man
[1:19:14] loves me he'll keep my words now you
[1:19:17] can't keep his words without having
[1:19:19] faith in what he said see so you see if
[1:19:22] you if he loves God then he keeps God's
[1:19:25] word
[1:19:26] if he said I'm the Lord that healeth
[1:19:29] thee he believes that love makes him
[1:19:31] believe it because the love dominates
[1:19:33] all though I speak with tongues of men
[1:19:35] and angels and have not love it's
[1:19:38] nothing see though I have faith to move
[1:19:40] mountains and not have love it's nothing
[1:19:43] love dominates all because God is love
[1:19:46] a love of a god of love now yes sir see
[1:19:50] Jesus said if a man loves me he will
[1:19:54] keep my words
[1:19:57] so if we have faith in God and to have
[1:20:00] have the love of God to love God and if
[1:20:03] we love God
[1:20:05] as you said then have faith and say and
[1:20:08] it should throw us into desperation
[1:20:12] Lord make Lord make us desperate if
[1:20:15] that's what it takes one because if we
[1:20:16] have the love of God then we see the
[1:20:18] world and the condition that things are
[1:20:20] in it should put us in a in a state of
[1:20:22] desperation
[1:20:24] but if but many times we've seen people
[1:20:26] you know they just they go along it's
[1:20:28] the same old same old and they never it
[1:20:31] never changes
[1:20:33] but you know it should throw us into
[1:20:35] desperation when we see the condition
[1:20:36] that the world is in
[1:20:39] it it should it should drive us to that
[1:20:42] and he said if you have the love of God
[1:20:44] in you and you have faith in God's word
[1:20:46] he said then it pushes your faith out on
[1:20:48] the Battlefront then what is it wherever
[1:20:51] the wherever the the the attack of the
[1:20:54] devil is or whatever taking place that
[1:20:55] it pushes you to have faith and go out
[1:20:57] there
[1:20:59] well because God doesn't have cowards
[1:21:01] it's going to push you out there
[1:21:03] but because you know if you if God if
[1:21:06] the Devil comes in and you're a Son of
[1:21:08] God and you and you know your place or
[1:21:10] you're a daughter of God and you know
[1:21:11] your place then you know what
[1:21:12] something's got to be inside of you to
[1:21:14] raise up to go against that
[1:21:16] well because he said when the Devil
[1:21:18] comes in like a flood when the enemy
[1:21:20] comes in he said he'll raise up a
[1:21:22] standard
[1:21:24] well you know many times people they
[1:21:26] think the problem is well we're just
[1:21:27] going to take a step back no God's
[1:21:30] working through you he's expecting you
[1:21:33] how many times did Brother around stand
[1:21:35] there and he was talking about having
[1:21:36] the prayer line and different people
[1:21:37] being sick and and the different things
[1:21:39] and he was standing there waiting on
[1:21:41] well God what are you going to do
[1:21:44] and God told Brother Brown I said well
[1:21:45] what are you going to do about it
[1:21:50] he said because you've got to have
[1:21:52] something to do with it because God will
[1:21:54] honor what you do
[1:21:55] what you say God honors your faith it's
[1:21:59] something that you've got to do
[1:22:01] not just wait on God well I'm just
[1:22:03] waiting to know you've got to take the
[1:22:04] got to move
[1:22:06] you got to take it one by what he says
[1:22:08] and claim it confess it
[1:22:10] 'll push you out on the onto the Battle
[1:22:12] Front
[1:22:13] God doesn't have cowards
[1:22:18] if we if we stand there and have needs
[1:22:21] and you know what and we don't ask God
[1:22:23] for what we have need of whatever it is
[1:22:26] if we don't claim it and believe that
[1:22:28] it's going to take place then you know
[1:22:29] what that we're dishonoring God
[1:22:32] that's a that's a that's a disrespect to
[1:22:34] God
[1:22:36] because you know what if he died on the
[1:22:38] cross of Calvary if he took those
[1:22:40] stripes on his back for your healing and
[1:22:42] he then he died on the cross for our
[1:22:44] justification that if we don't walk in
[1:22:46] exactly all of that
[1:22:50] you know what because you know what
[1:22:51] Hayden Hayden what an Indian giver when
[1:22:54] he died and it took those stripes on his
[1:22:56] back for our healing
[1:22:58] and he said I am the god to healeth all
[1:23:01] your diseases and all your iniquities
[1:23:03] are healed
[1:23:04] then you know what if we carry those
[1:23:06] diseases with us and have not put it
[1:23:08] under the blood and claiming our healing
[1:23:10] and walking in that then you know what
[1:23:12] that we dishonor what God Said
[1:23:16] because you know if if God if somebody
[1:23:19] gives you something and you don't take
[1:23:21] it
[1:23:24] well you know it's just like when
[1:23:26] somebody needs something and you've got
[1:23:28] it there before them and you're holding
[1:23:29] it out to them and saying listen this is
[1:23:31] what you have need of
[1:23:35] just like when he was talking about the
[1:23:36] man sitting on the doorstep of the
[1:23:38] doctor and the doctor trying to help him
[1:23:40] and giving him medicine and telling this
[1:23:42] is what you got to do to get better and
[1:23:44] the man dies on the doorstep why because
[1:23:46] he's right there and he sees the doctor
[1:23:48] face to face and here's what the doctor
[1:23:50] tells him and he gives him the exact the
[1:23:52] the prescription of what he has to do
[1:23:54] but he does but he fails to do it
[1:23:57] and it's the same way if you have a need
[1:24:00] then you know what if you've not put it
[1:24:01] if you've not handed over to God if
[1:24:03] you've not claimed what you have need of
[1:24:05] if you've not claimed your Victory then
[1:24:07] tonight is the night to do that
[1:24:11] you know if the devil's jumped on your
[1:24:14] back and he's hey whatever he's done
[1:24:16] then you know what you know what just
[1:24:17] stand up and say you know I claim I
[1:24:20] claim my Deliverance I claim my healing
[1:24:22] I claim my blessings in Jesus Christ's
[1:24:25] name whatever it is that you have need
[1:24:27] of you just claim it why because he's
[1:24:29] made the way
[1:24:31] I don't know I don't know how he's going
[1:24:33] to work these things out I've got money
[1:24:36] problems or whatever it is but you know
[1:24:38] what when God speaks to your situation
[1:24:40] he begins to speak then you know what
[1:24:42] you claim it Lord I don't know how
[1:24:43] you're going to work it out but you know
[1:24:44] I know you're going to work it out
[1:24:48] now I can just take my hands off of it
[1:24:51] but I'm gonna give it over to you
[1:24:55] I I tell them about brother JT's Church
[1:24:59] you know
[1:25:00] you know when I'm going to preach on I
[1:25:02] preached on Levi up there
[1:25:05] but you know I was talking about when
[1:25:07] Levi was little you know it didn't
[1:25:09] matter what it was you know he he told
[1:25:11] everybody daddy was a fixer
[1:25:14] I worked in maintenance but you know I
[1:25:17] was a fixer and it didn't matter what it
[1:25:19] was
[1:25:20] I he I could fix it
[1:25:23] you know he just gave it to Harry here
[1:25:25] Dad
[1:25:27] it's like you know Plastics broke
[1:25:28] somehow I'm supposed to weld it back
[1:25:31] together or whatever you know he didn't
[1:25:33] care he's like Dad it's yours here
[1:25:35] you're going to work you got miracles
[1:25:37] you just work them
[1:25:39] well sometimes you know what there's no
[1:25:41] Miracles that you can work
[1:25:44] you know it's it's it's beyond all hope
[1:25:48] now it's time for the garbage can
[1:25:51] it's easier it's like let's buy you
[1:25:53] another one because that one's gone
[1:25:55] they're not but you know the thing about
[1:25:56] God is there's no there's no such thing
[1:25:59] as hopeless
[1:26:02] there's there's no such thing as no hope
[1:26:04] and and you know you know well it's got
[1:26:07] you know I you know God's a god of
[1:26:09] Miracles
[1:26:12] when it when it gets to the place where
[1:26:13] it looks impossible
[1:26:15] when you don't see a way out
[1:26:18] that's when God Specializes that's when
[1:26:21] God comes on the scene and that's what
[1:26:23] he wants you and I to do put our faith
[1:26:25] in him and spell wait on him to come and
[1:26:28] because you know like lots of times
[1:26:31] just like the Hebrew the the children of
[1:26:34] the Hebrew children you know when they
[1:26:35] went into the fire
[1:26:37] you know they didn't know how they were
[1:26:38] going to get out or if they were going
[1:26:39] to get out but you know what they had
[1:26:40] faith in God
[1:26:44] wait we're not going to Bow we're not
[1:26:46] going to we're not going to follow that
[1:26:47] and if we have to go into fire we just
[1:26:48] go in the fire because our God's more
[1:26:50] than able to deliver us we don't know if
[1:26:51] he don't but you know what we're still
[1:26:52] got a testimony
[1:26:54] that we're not giving up and we're not
[1:26:56] bowing
[1:27:02] and because of their
[1:27:05] because of their faith in God because of
[1:27:08] what their testimony was
[1:27:10] God didn't send somebody he couldn't
[1:27:12] send an angel or anything they say no I
[1:27:15] got to go down there myself
[1:27:18] he was in the midst of the fire with him
[1:27:22] when you when you ever looks impossible
[1:27:26] you just look for God because he'll be
[1:27:27] there
[1:27:28] amen God bless you tonight let's all

[1:36:22] us and we just can't thank you enough
[1:36:23] for all your best blessings on us Lord
[1:36:26] we commit all things to you in the name
[1:36:28] of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless
[1:36:31] you you're dismissed
[1:36:33] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[1:36:38] the pilgrim way for the hand of God in
[1:36:42] all my life
[1:36:43] [Music]
[1:37:01] [Music]
[1:37:08] I rejoice in night and day as I walk but
[1:37:13] her away for the comforter abides in me
