me but to hear the word to hear from god amen he is your creator he is your savior he is your healer so he's the one that we want to hear from amen praise the lord jesus we appreciate the lord and we thank god for giving us protection while we were out this past weekend for the dutch and his the church and his greetings and uh we certainly had a good time so as i told some other people you know the lord said what he needed to say so i believe i believe i believe we the the church enjoyed the word of god and we had some good fellowship with them um didn't know but but you just pray for brother tatum brother tatum uh his apparently he fell the following day which was monday and fell right on his face split open his head and stuff and like he's got stitches all the way down so he broke his neck and so you pray for him he's about 70 something years old so sunday he was fine no problems he was there at church monday he's having stitches so i had no idea until brother wade told me just now so so you remember brother tatum in your prayers amen and also continue to remember his wife in prayer um she uh you know how she's been battling with with her mind and and they've been having issues with the dementia and uh so but it's just when you talk with her you know i came up to her and it was talking to her and and she said well just give me a hug i haven't hugged you in a long time i had never hugged her before but that's all right and so i have no qualms of hugging our elderly sisters you know i just see them as mothers but it was just interesting because you know she i don't know i've only seen her maybe like three or four times in my lifetime so she was acting like i just known her forever you remember hearing your prayers remember them especially now that brother tatum he fell so the lord would give him a a quick recovery amen amen well let's just go to the lord in prayer we thank that god for uh bringing brother wade back and uh my goodness we certainly enjoyed listening in to the sermons is on sunday man i i believe the lord deserves another clap of praise these brothers did a wonderful job and certainly certainly i would i would hope brother dale would think he's proud [Laughter] amen and they did an excellent job from sunday school sermon uh all the way to the afternoon service it was exactly what the lord needed to say amen not to mention brother brother aaron man he was as sharp as a yeah sharp as a needle yeah so you need to see it more often though amen you look good look good well we just thank the lord sister alicia don't feel bad that was an excellent song and sometimes sometimes you know it may not come out right but the intention god sees the heart amen so that's that's what's most important amen all right well let's go to the lord and uh let's just read his word this this evening and let's turn to philippians chapter four philippians chapter four i want to start i guess i want to start on a little series about think on these things and uh this first part i want to call it's time to ditch your stinking thinking amen so i don't know how long how long this might take us and uh of course it's probably gonna take us a long time since you know we don't constantly preach but um it'll be more of a series um the lord's just been dealing with me on this scripture ever since really ever since colbert hit and it's just been a battle for me personally personally because i'm the type of person that you know i see things around the world and i look at them very different than most people look at things and when you sit there and look at things constantly and and ponder over those things and maybe what's going on behind the scenes and that your family might be in trouble and that they're out there to kill you and all these things it really drains you it really drains your spirit it really drains your your emotions it really drains your you're even you're you're you're even your trust in the lord but but when the lord when i when i came on this scripture philippians chapter 4 and i visited back in in in 2020 came back and uh it really gave me strength during that time and then i came back uh and revisited it again here this this past year and early early this year it's really put into a lot into perspective of what we as christians we really need to do and what really really really matters in life it's not all about what's going on but around the world the world's going to do what they're going to do as i've always said the lord is going to allow anything and everything to happen in order for his word to be fulfilled and for his bride to get ready you see there might be agendas behind the scene there might be conspiracies and things like that but we don't know all the details but only god knows but all that we need to worry and be concerned about is what god is doing through his word and that god is fulfilling his word and so the and so sometimes we just need to just lay aside our own thinking because let me tell you a lot of not not just not just the news and not just the the media but but even other things that might might take a hold of our mind it can really wear you out and completely take you away from you being concentrated on god and that's all that matters really in this life what what is it what what did uh solomon say i believe he said he said the whole thing ends up uh and just one this one thing serve the lord and keep his commandments and that's all really life is what it's about well the only thing that matters is him and so we just want to we want to take a little series on that and basing it upon this scripture and then another one we're going to read so let's read here in philippians chapter 4. let's just go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you lord jesus once again for the opportunity to serve you lord we appreciate heavenly father the blessings lord that you give us through your word we know heavenly father that you sent your word father and you sent to heal us lord and not just heavenly father physically but also mentally lord god also lord spiritually lord jesus there's healing throughout all this word father and i pray lord god that you would just help us tonight father as we endeavor to look into your word if whatever father any person here lord is battling mentally lord god is battling lord spiritually father we battling physically lord with health lord god battling with doubts uh lord god i pray that this this would help them tonight lord jesus lord you be the speaker father god we invite you to come in tonight lord god meet our needs lord jesus we are a needy people lord god your bride father is the neediest people lord here on this earth and lord god we totally depend on you lord we just commit ourselves into your hands now during this time we love you and we appreciate you in jesus christ and we pray amen amen philippians chapter 4 verse 4 it says rejoice in the lord all way and again i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand amen be careful for nothing be careful for nothing in other words don't worry about anything don't worry about anything the world is falling apart all around us but paul says don't worry about anything but in everything and everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and i like the way he says there by with thanksgiving in other words as you're praying you're already thanking god for answering your prayer amen with thanksgiving praise the lord let your requests be made known unto god and the peace watch what happens when you do this and the peace of god which passeth all understanding which you try to seek on your own but you're not going to be able to do it so therefore do as paul says here and when you do that the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through who through christ jesus now watch verse 8 says finally brethren whatsoever things are true we know the word is true whatsoever things are honest and we know the word is honest whatsoever things are just we know the word is just whatsoever things are pure and we know the word is pure whatsoever things are lovely we know the word of god is lovely whatsoever things are of good report that's a good report it's not a cnn report it's god's report [Laughter] amen if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things amen those things which now what look paul says here those things which he have learned and received and heard and seen in me my goodness paul sounds like he's being haughty and and and who does he think he is but he had an experience with god he met god and they saw in so much that he could say amen the things that you have seen in me watch what he says do and the god of peace shall be with you amen and then while i still have you standing let's go to romans 12 verse 1 through 2 and he says there i beseech you therefore brethren paul's still speaking here by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and then he says here and be not conformed to this world be not conformed in other words don't be molded into this world but be ye transformed amen don't be conformed be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen you may be seated this afternoon amen think on these things amen now the new living uh uh version of of romans 12 2 it says it like this it says don't copy the behavior and customs of this world hmm don't copy the behavior and customs of this world of course when you're not a christian you will do less like the world you will act and you will talk and you will think like the world because that's what attracts you amen if a christian the word of god is what's attractive to him or her but to uh but to a a a a person that doesn't believe the world and its behaviors and its customs and its way of thinking that's what will attract them but paul clearly says here don't copy the behavior and customs of this world but but let god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think amen by changing the way you think amen it's by changing the way you think you know nothing that has happened in your life or nothing that has happened in in as you lived your out your life has not happened without you thinking about it first amen you thought about this this afternoon you thought about i need to get in my car and drop the church and guess what happened your church right you know that that's a creative thing about the human human being that you can think it and it can come to pass because god created us in his image and in his likeness and and he's a creator therefore the his thoughts are are are are and when he speaks amen those are his thoughts expressed amen so he says here paul says here let uh god transform you into a new person by changing the way you think then you will learn to know god's will for you which is good and pleasing and perfect uh good pleasing and perfect amen so what does paul hear say that that we need to have our mind renewed amen he was talking to believers here all right because we don't get everything in the new birth we don't we get we get our soul is transformed amen we get god's spirit but we still have to fight a nature amen we still have to fight that spirit man amen we still have to fight that thing and then paul even had to fight it he said himself that i had he had to die daily how much more us amen the ones that we cannot even say hey we cannot even say hey follow me as i follow christ can you say that to somebody amen paul could and yet he had to die daily and yet he had trouble amen even in his own flesh in his own spirit amen how much more us in the hour that we're living in amen where everything is so seductive and everything is so tempting and everything is so gray and everything is so mixed and man if you want to be a woman when you're a man you can be a woman if you want to be a transsexual when you're when you're a man or or or homosexual or whatever you want to be you could just be it because the world said so because doctors say it's okay because they know more than god so they think and they'll get a big surprise really soon i believe amen so if our thinking was okay already then paul wouldn't have said this he wouldn't have said to have your minds be renewed amen we need to have our minds renewed because daily as christians we're constantly battling amen devils amen from left and right amen if you're not battling then you're not a christian that's just simple as that you're not battling become a christian then you'll know what battling is all about but when you're a christian you battle man you have struggles and you have fights and you have you have things amen within you amen that you got us wrestle with amen and satan knows exactly where to punch at you more amen so so it's it's up to us amen what what what we let form us saints amen it's up to us and how we choose what we let form us is by is by choosing what we think and how we think about those things amen so if you're thinking about things amen positive things and and and and constantly thinking about god then what are you gonna be like amen amen there's a scripture here that we'll read later amen but but in psalms chapter one where he's where he david says blessed is the man that that that meditates on his law day and night day and night what are you meditating on amen is it your music is it your video games is it your job is it your your ideas amen your own ideas they're outside of the word of god amen and that's what you'll become whatever you meditate on praise the lord jesus and so and so and looking at thoughts we know that thoughts they're they're transforming amen they transform thoughts are very important i don't even think i don't even think that we have given the importance of thoughts like we should amen because they remember what created the heavens and the earth it was the thought of god and he spoke it and it became amen what caused you to be here remember what i said a while ago you thought about getting in that car and it became the past amen praise the lord later on you're going to have thoughts right now you're even having thoughts about the things you're about to do after the service and if you fulfill those things that means those were thoughts expressed amen maybe you speak about them first maybe after we get out of service you're going to tell somebody i'm going to cook out and get me a burger and then i'm going home to bed man enjoy your heartburn after that i had me some onion rings with it too yeah and a and uh cookies and cream milk shake man that's a recipe for a heartburn right there throughout the night man i've certainly had some of those on thursday mornings during the night after a wednesday night goodness gracious but it's good but see that's your thoughts right and your thoughts will manifest into actions and will manifest into things amen praise the lord that's how god's thoughts are and his thoughts are serious his thoughts are real amen we wouldn't have the animals we wouldn't have the plants we wouldn't have the trees the the mountains the seas the lakes the rivers the things that we enjoy amen the sun moon and stars we wouldn't enjoy none of these things if god's thoughts amen weren't there first and then he spoke them praise the lord so thoughts are creative thoughts are important right thoughts are very very very very important praise the lord jesus and so thoughts they relate to words and we know that words they're highly important amen what you say or don't say amen can make the difference praise the lord jesus he puts us preachers amen sometimes on the spot [Laughter] amen sometimes there you could say something right there at the right moment at the right time it may cause somebody a man to receive their healing right there and then amen and sometimes you can say some things amen that would just dampen the the holy spirit and cause people to miss their healing amen so words are very important and what are words their thoughts expressed or in other words they're also a thought capsule or thought containers think about it that way amen you ever taken a capsule with some medicine in it that's just a portion of the big storage of medicine of that of that medicine that they have somewhere else amen a little capsule of whatever you're taking amen that amen has that has power that has potential to help you in whatever way he needs to amen but that's what words are there they're expressions of thoughts amen you're when you're when you say something you have to think it first then you say it sometimes we have to think longer than others and some of us we should think longer than others before we even say things amen you know i watched this thing the other day and it said the the power of silence there's power in silence sometimes it's better just to not even say anything and that makes the other person uh unsure you know insecure you know oh man what's going on the power of silence sometimes we need more like thing silence and thinking we always need to say something amen praise god because sometimes by saying things we might do more damage than good amen praise the lord jesus amen you know when i'm interpreting here if i'm interpreting for a minister you know into the english or spanish language oftentimes i'm interpreting and i get in that in that in that channel so much and if the brother is preaching i oftentimes know what he's getting ready to save even before he says it because i can get into the channel of his thoughts and if it's the holy spirit speaking through him amen then then that god that's in me can be able to grab those thoughts and be able to speak them to the people interpreting whether it's in the english or spanish language amen that's how powerful amen the thoughts thoughts are amen praise god thought thought containers amen thought capsules praise the lord jesus brother brown says here in the message law or grace uh so the question is what are god's thoughts he says here you know sunday how we got into it we when god speaks it has to be so all right there's no way at all to get away from it god says let there be and it has to be nothing the very word itself and the word was a thought god when he before a word is an expression of a thought god thought it in his mind spoke it into existence amen and then in the message god hiding himself in simplicity he says here now with the blood of bulls and goats watch this if the blood of bulls and goats could give a power to moses to go out there by the commission of god and stretch forth that rod and say let there come flies he had the word of god and he spoke that word and when he did it become from god's thought a word is a thought expressed amen so in other words before moses could speak it it had to be in the mind of god first then he gave it to moses then moses could speak it then it came to be right praise god and so then when god thought it and put it in moses's mind and he spoke it it become a word and moses turned around and went back maybe maybe not a fly in the country when he spoke it i wonder if that's how we feel sometimes hey man when we speak god's word amen we don't see immediate changes i mean i wonder if moses didn't get discouraged there for a moment maybe he didn't see a fly but watch what brother branham says and and moses turned around and went back and maybe not a fly in the country in an hour from then maybe one old green fly began to buzz around amen in a half hour there was 10 pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of god that was spoke by the lips of a mortal man amen all moses had to do was just speak what he was given he didn't have to think about how to how to make it you know make it to come to pass he just needed to speak it and wait god will take care of the rest amen it's god's original thought it's god's creative thought it's god's eternal thought and therefore it has to manifest itself because god can't and he can never what he can never change he can never fail amen his original thought amen will always be it will never that's the reason why we can say and the word of god says that he the world will pass away but his thoughts will never pass away his word will never pass away amen those are his thoughts expressed this word that you and me are reading are his thoughts praise god amen you might be saying amen lord you you're claiming something you're claiming your children you're cleaning your healing whatever it is amen you may not see any fruition right there but just wait just wait amen because when you're expressing god's word those are those are his eternal thoughts they've got to have a creative action behind it something's going to happen if you stay right with it amen it's not about it's not you don't have to work up anything let god do the work amen it was god that put the flies in there amen it was god that created the squirrels amen all brother brandon did was just give receive the thought and he spoke it and there the squirrels was praise god and it's god amen that will be the one to change your children it was going to be god the one to change amen your give you the healing in your body praise god all you got to do is confess his thoughts amen continue in his thought and his word that's all we care about what did paul said he said think on these things whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are right or just are pure and all that are the correct characteristics of the jesus christ and he is what the word and he is the thoughts of god amen praise the lord jesus how many are still with me praise the lord so we see that god's thoughts saints they are revealed in his word and we see that they're revealed by his creation amen we see the creation the mountains everything we see around us they're god's thoughts expressed praise the lord amen and amen when he created the the way that the animals to procreate that was god's thoughts when satan's thought it was god's thought praise the lord when he created the law of procreation for a human man and a human woman to procreate that was god's thoughts amen of course originally it was by the word praise the lord but god by his permissive will amen he's allowed the way to that we come about in this in this what in this hour and you know what when it's done right when it's done in order it's a beautiful thing but when you go outside of the word of god amen to try to do that outside of his word amen to defile a girl or to defile yourself in in that way amen that's contrary to god's word that's not in god's original thinking amen praise god see the world they've perverted these original thoughts of god amen they they perverted it look look because all we see today saints is an attack on life i don't know if have you watched the news lately or if you just it has been an attack on life period which in turn is an attack on christianity which in turn is an attack on god amen now i want us to to pay attention to this for just a moment our younger people amen because i know our younger people and maybe maybe some of us adults this is so bombarded in the media today and in everything that we watch and in the schools and in all these things that everywhere we go now i mean next month i believe is what they call pride month next thing you know i mean in canada i think they got pride three months three months of celebrating perversion but of course it's celebrated all year round amen so they got to give it a certain time frame now so that it can help you amen educate you so they think educate christians and christians are falling into the trap of just being accepting and and they're just that way and young people they're the they they just well as long as it makes them happy it's all right i'm not gonna do it but as long as they're happy amen but what does god's word say about it amen does god take that that thought amen i believe we need to love those that that that believe that way we love them we have well and i know some of us we have family members that are maybe the in that way i have family members that are that that that are that way that have those alternative lifestyles and we love them i believe god died for them too amen but we don't need to accept they meant their ideas and and them indoctrinating us amen and them forcing themselves on us through every avenue that there is out here amen because they're the ones amen we they're they're fighting something with us that we never picked with them amen i never went out to to to uh uh uh uh you know curse them or anything like that or i just leave them alone what you do in your bedroom is between you and god amen between you and satan amen that has nothing to do with me that has nothing to do with my children it has nothing to do with the church praise god but it's become now mainstream in such a way that now you must accept it it's what they tell you you you have to accept it and if you don't you're intolerant and and and and you're and you're hateful amen and all these groups amen these and i'm i'm just going to say it black lives matter and all these groups say man they support all those agendas they're even their leaders black lives matter amen they support they say we we go the marxist ways that's their original the leader i have a video of the leader of the black lives matters they say we our agenda is the marxist way and what and what is marxist way is communism supporting homosexuality supporting these these things amen it's not about race they're about trying to transform a society amen so that you can accept their their perverse lifestyles and they're trying to destroy satan through those groups and through and through our governments are trying to destroy christianity and you think it's all about race and it's not i want you to think about those things before we go out there supporting and holding our fists and all those types of things think about what you're supporting and look at the history of these things amen because it's not what you think it is it is not what you think it is right and so god said in it so satan's attack amen and this day on life is relentless we see it in every aspect but what does god say god said in genesis chapter five verse one and two he says this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him amen i believe god is male amen amen praise the lord but watch in verse two he says male and female created he them now remember we're thinking about thoughts i'm not trying to offend anybody that's not my intention i think we need to talk about these things we don't talk about them enough because they are they are they are waving in into our society and they're weaving into our our youth and they're just accepting these things like it's normal and it's never been normal in the eyes of god it's never been normal male and female i don't see any other gender there do you believe the word of god what do i see there male and female i don't see any uh other gender in there i don't see uh uh you know whatever genders they have out there now they got this long string of names now lgbtq a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p it is whatever you want remember we're living in the age of the of the pale horse rider it's a mixture of everything and you could just be whatever you want and it's okay but remember it all started from from death it all started from death amen praise god see the word and so it says here male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created praise god now the world says it's okay to be whatever gender you want to be but what does god say amen amen male and female created he them see there's people out there that have they have they were born males they've transformed to females by surgeries pills or whatever and now they regret doing what they did i've watched already several documentaries about that and then when they try to transform back it ain't the same it's because you've put your thoughts into what god originally made you to be and now you're you're really a perversion then you're really a perversion then because you put your own thing into it right but see that's not what they're going to tell they're not going to tell you that in school they're not going to tell you that society's not going to tell you that however you feel that's how you should be they go by feelings and if you feel it then that's that's then express yourself that way be prideful about it when god says that the hottie uh it will be destroyed pride will be what will be brought down but these people are prideful we might get shut down by youtube for this well it's all right maybe it's time let me tell you what there's going to come a day where when they're going they're going to come right through here shut these doors and everything like that what are you going to do then you're going to have to face these things amen our young people are facing them so you might as well not just oh well they let them let them let you know they'll they'll figure it out themselves no you as the parent has to deal with these things you as the parent have to take time with your children explain these things they may tell them the truth amen tell them the truth they might not like it but it's the truth because it's from the word they're not mad at you they're mad at the god amen praise god see the world says it's okay to be whatever gender you want to be but let me tell you that you can change your gender you can come to this world and be a man you can come to this world as a woman as a female and change your gender or whatever but when you die and they dig up your bones the dna will show and the bones will show what you really were the the bones will not they they won't say oh this was a male turned into a woman or this is a woman turn into a no the bones will say what you were from the beginning because it speaks of the beginning it always speaks of the original life of god you can never get away from that the world thinks tells you that you can but you can't you like you can die and a hundred years later they'll dig up your bones and you say you're a male when you were a woman amen they'll know that you're a woman by the way your body was shaped by the way you are they'll know that but people nowadays don't know that but a hundred years from now they'll know that when they dig up your bones do you understand what i'm saying it's a ridiculous idea and it's satanic praise god and they tell you that the homosexual lifestyles are okay and the lesbian lifestyles are okay and we should just be acceptive and not tolerate it amen not not when they're trying to indoctrinate my children no no no i mean and i want us to think about this for just a moment think about this do you believe that god is pro-life you know there's a hot topic right now about about about about babies i got this article right here that i want to read here not the whole thing but disgusting things that they california and some of these democrat states amen but i'm not talking about this i'm talking about as far as the homosexual and lesbian lifestyle and all that stuff we believe that god is pro-life right right but we know he's alive i mean he created the heavens and the earth he created the animals he created you and you are living right now not by your own will but by god at this very moment no matter how rebellious you are no matter how haughty or prideful you are god could stop your heart at this very moment where would you be then but you're living and you're sitting here amen by the grace of god by the grace of god your heart could stop at this very moment and you think that you're so big and bad and you don't even control the life that runs through you through you right now some of us young people we think we're all so big and bad and we got it all under control amen you don't control anything god controls you you have no control amen god could stop your shut you down right now at this very moment he's done it in the past and do it again so how should we live how should we live so is god is god pro-life i believe he is he loves life he's the originator of life he is life amen and in him there's no darkness amen he said i am the bread of life right praise god but let me ask you this question so if god is pro-life then that must mean that satan is what anti-life right now i mean the bible says that the enemy has come to kill steal and destroy he say he satan is like a royal lion seeking whom he may devour and when a lion devours something it's not being devoured alive or i mean it is maybe but then eventually it dies so let's do two plus two or one plus one so if god is pro-life and satan is anti-life when they tell you it's okay for two men to get married it's okay for two women to get married but they can't procreate they can't bring forth life right so what agenda is that it's satan's anti-god agenda anti-life agenda what is being promoted is anti-life because two men can't have babies i'm just gonna be raw here two women can't have babies therefore they got to go and and and and and uh uh what's the word adopt adopt and be adopted in that perversion yes i said it's a perversion because a baby is not going to grow up healthy with two men or two women as raising them this is never that's not how god created that what did we just read male and female created he them right i've never i've never i remember hearing this from the baptist church amen god created adam and eve not adam and steve amen it just doesn't work you're not going to have babies with two males you're not gonna have babies with two females but you will have babies with male and female and he blessed them and called their name adam amen here and in just a moment we will read another scripture so we got to understand saints that that satan is totally we're thinking about the thoughts of god right and i want us to touch upon these things because these are the here's the thought of god but then satan is bringing in his thoughts amen praise the lord and so he's always the opposite of god so we got to understand that satan is anti-life praise the lord and so satan these agendas have been presented because satan hates procreation between a man and a woman in marriage all right you can write these down if you want he hates the family he hates the family he he knows that that that families are backbones of of a country backbones of of a church amen they have power especially when they have god as a as as their main as the one they worship satan hates healthy relationships between a husband and a wife amen satan hates relationships between parents and children oh he hates that and he'll do anything to try to destroy that that relationship amen between the children and the parent amen satan hates the potential that man has for positive change amen especially when they have the holy spirit amen amen that even people without the holy spirit can bring positive change amen satan hates the image of god which is in man you don't have to be a christian to be the image of god every man was created in the image of god amen praise the lord satan hates life and again satan hates god that's the reason why these agendas and these lifestyles are promoted to you as normality and they are not the bible tells me so and i'm just going to believe what the bible says i don't care what joe biden says and i don't care what gensake says i don't care what anybody says amen the bible tells me that male and female created heath then amen demi lovato she comes out as as non-binary what is that i didn't see that in that verse what is a non-binary i just read male and female yeah oh but you got to just be tolerant they're non-bilinear it's not in the word of god the word is not that word is not even in the word of god why do i have to tolerate that sam smith miley cyrus all of these they've come out as non-binaries and some of young people know may know who i'm talking about homosexuals right now today that you might even listen to little nas x anderson cooper from cnn you get your news from from from gays elton john we've known we've known he's always tim cook the one who's produced our apple products he's proudly gay and so that's why you see when you see in there on their websites and all these things they're promoting the those those those rainbow flags and all that stuff it's because they themselves live it and they they want you to go ahead and think it's okay but the word of god tells me it's not all i see is male and female i keep reiterating that thought because that's the thought of god amen and i want people on youtube to listen to our lesbians of today's ellen degeneres caller ellen degeneret but we listened to her show regularly watch her show elliott page jody foster rosie o'donnell the lesbians who have come out of the closet and and they're just proud they want you to think that their lifestyle is okay i don't see it in the bible all i see is male and female praise the lord amen in genesis 1 26 brother way's favorite verse says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion you see that god wants man to have dominion amen over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth amen even the cockroaches amen god created man in his own verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them there it is again i don't see non-binary i don't see any other gender there i see male and female wow and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful a non-binary can't be fruitful a lesbian can't be fruitful a homosexual can't be fruitful and multiply they can't do it how do you do it amen and replenish the earth and subdue it see that can only happen if it's a male and a female i'm just you know just so that you can understand god's thoughts young people understand god's thoughts don't take in the world's thoughts don't you don't have to accept the world's thoughts remember the world will pass away but god's thoughts will never pass away amen praise god so saints any thought opposed to this scripture is anti-life and therefore is anti-god they don't want people to procreate they don't want people to uh uh uh you know you can think whatever but you can go down to i forget what part of georgia it is they got these stones right there they're they're sitting there two stones and and uh elberton georgia that's it and one of them one of the top is like their commandments and one of them is to keep the population and one of the says is keep the population under 500 million why would somebody write that so they have agendas and this is part of their agenda amen this is anti-life anti-anti-anti-god amen and since satan is anti-life and anti-god therefore aborting or killing innocent babies is anti-life and it's legalized murder that's what it is oh brother luis you shouldn't talk about those things you shouldn't talk about politics over the pulpit but you face it every single day i'm just talking about god's thoughts versus man's thoughts satan's thoughts i'm talking about life amen praise god just just real quick this is just in march just a few months ago california bill would allow killing babies in infanticide up to 28 days after birth so not just in the womb but the baby can be born outside the mom can take it home and if she decides i don't want it anymore it can 28 days after birth this was on this was on uh forgot what website this is life news i think california policymakers who make up the future abortion of abortion council just dropped a bombshell they intend to not only codify the killing of unborn children throughout all nine months of pregnancy but to decriminalize killing newborns days or even weeks after birth new language added to ab2223 which is their the the law last week revealed the disturbing intent the proposed legislation would shield a mother from civil and criminal charges for any actions or omissions related to her pregnancy including miscarriage stillbirth or abortion or pr prenata uh prenatal death although definitions of perinatal death vary all of them include the demise of newborns seven days or more after birth can you imagine that that's that's that's that's what they're thinking and that thought didn't come from god the bill from assemblywoman buffy wicks additionally protects anyone who aids or assists a pregnant person in exercising these rights it also allows a woman to sue any police department or legal authority which arrests or charges her for hurting or killing her child under provisions of the bill so in other words if the woman says i you know i want to just throw out the baby and kill it or whatever the cops can't go after her if they if they pass that governor newsome formed the future of abortion council last year governor newson in an effort to turn california into a sanctuary state for the procedure organizers listed ab2223 as part of their legislation package implementing a 45-point plan to expand and protect access to abortion in california a few weeks ago maryland introduced a bill that decriminalizes neglecting newborns to death using the same prenatal death language though the bill hearing was canceled was cancelled all right so that is what they are thinking about life amen so you young people amen how thankful you should be amen your parents didn't do that to you because that is what's happening right now amen do you have the opportunity to live you have the opportunity to grow work get married have children of your own amen do great things be creators amen not to waste your life away amen praise god i like that it's quiet you're either sleeping or you're listening praise the lord amen so what are god's thoughts about you here's what god thinks about you amen in jeremiah 29 11. he says for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord he said thoughts of peace and not of evil amen do you think this is evil so it's anti-god amen it can't be of god thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you what an expected end amen praise the lord jesus so he said adam and eve when they walked with the lord in the cool of the day you know when they were talking to god and god came down in the cool of the day what were they sharing they were sharing god's thoughts and probably god would come down and say adam eve you know what y'all been doing today it's not like he didn't know no but he wanted to talk with them and listen here i created this here this there because of this this this this and you see how this connects with this and this is the reason why for this and amen i believe he was sharing them with them thoughts of peace not thoughts of evil amen praise the lord jesus and i believe that's what god wants for each and every one of us but we have chaotic lives maybe we find ourselves in a chaotic life battling within yourself should i or should i not should i give up the world or should i serve the lord it's a battle amen but god is saying that he's given thoughts of peace not of evil and if you have turmoil in your life it's your own fault amen it's your own fault there's no need to be in turmoil when god has given us these thoughts of peace and not of evil amen praise the lord jesus so then god was coming down in the cool of the day talking with adam and eve sharing his thoughts amen but then here comes a sly satan comes in to share his thoughts see god has his thoughts and then satan has his thoughts right so he comes in and he makes sure that he gets uh eve all to himself he starts sharing his thoughts to eve now adam was not around because if adam was around he would have put a stop to it he was a son of god amen that's why young girls amen you need to be careful amen you don't need you have no business of being alone in a room with any guy you guys don't need to be in a room alone with any girls there's no there's no business for that that's not your wife if that's not your sister is that not your mom or if that's not your grandmother you don't need to be in that room alone with that girl especially when the dad's not around the mom's not around and when guys come to you slightly talking to you asking you inappropriate questions have you ever kissed guys before have you ever did this that or the other if this if you weren't this then maybe we could this could happen what kind of questions are those huh what are you trying to bring what what's your motive see that's inappropriate same thing with girls to guys what are you trying to do with that you're bypassing the the the the father you're bypassing the mother you're bypassing amen authority in order to to get that's what it seems like in order to get to that to that girl can hear that pin drop but it's inappropriate you don't do that girls you be careful when these slickers come around amen just like satan came around talking to eve made sure that adam was not around amen to talk to you about the about about inappropriate things what you need to do is you need to get out step away the bible says to the youth flee temptation flee youthful lusts amen in other words run run from those things because he knows paul knew that you can fall you can easily fall but if you sit there and let let the slicker talk to you and and and get into your mind oh but he likes me oh he's so oh look at his hair oh amen you know that's how satan came to eve didn't come to eve like a drunk with flies flying all around him all around you know hey you know i got i got something for you did god say he didn't come in like that he came in all slick amen amen maybe he was sharp maybe he even had a suit on all slick smelling good smelling like the latest style cologne they didn't come in with his breath all stinking and everything nah came in slick smooth nice and talkative amen trying to find amen your weakness trying to find eve's weakness trying to gather information so that he can at the appropriate time that's exactly what happened so so young young girls i i implore you you you're in a room with a guy it doesn't need to be if there's no other people in there there's no need for you to be in a room with a girl by with a guy by yourself especially guys that are not even christians don't even have the holy ghost but they'll talk to you smooth oh my god slick ricks what time we got i'm so i'm just taking my time because i know this is going to be a multiple part listen i'm a father i'm a husband i went that way i know what it's like some of you young people think that we're just idiots and that we never went through those stages in life and that we don't know what it feels like to to feel tempted and have those feelings and and and and things like that we know amen we know and and so i've got a duty to protect my girls just like any father does man god gave me those girls i will do anything in in in what i can to protect them whether they get mad or not but eventually it'll be for their own good i told i told my daughter one time i said bella one of the greatest privileges that i will ever have is to be able to walk you down that aisle amen amen amen i think that is the great one of the greatest privileges that a man can ever have for her for her for her for his daughter pure and undefiled from the world amen that's how it was at the beginning amen when adam was when he was put to sleep amen eve was brought to to to adam and who was holding her by the hand it was god the father and she was pure she was clean she was amen unadulterated amen and that is your purpose young girls that is your purpose right amen your purpose first and foremost is to serve god but then second of all amen is to be able to have the man that god gave you amen your husband and that man amen whoever it is amen then sneakily go by you know trying to text you or trying to email you amen amen he went through the right channels to get to be your husband that is the right way that is god's way and that will be a blessing it's a great blessing i promise you it's a great blessing a bender done that praise the lord so so we know that satan he introduced his thoughts to eve and we know that eve received those thoughts and you see that's the thing with young girls young girls they easily receive thoughts and that's why husbands fathers listen to me for just a moment it is so important for you to s either spend that quality time with your girls with your daughters let them know that you love them let them know how beautiful they are even go out on dates with them and things like that amen things that will keep them amen to let them know hey i'm loved by my father i'm protected by my father so whatever weasel comes around i know that if he doesn't act like my father i'm not gonna go boy that is your duty as a father i don't need to do that you know they'll get everything at the youth camp they'll get everything at church no you got to spend you've got to have time with them god didn't give you your children for just 50 of you being you raising them 50 and then the world or whoever raises them the other 50 no it's a full-time job so it's you're the one who to answer man your children aren't gonna answers you're just gonna answer as the parent praise god so eve received these thoughts and our young girls they easily receive their thoughts why because they are fragile they are fragile especially in those ages listen there's nothing wrong with our young people wanting to have a relationship with the opposite sex there is nothing wrong with that god ordained it that way right there is nothing wrong with that but do it in the right way the right channels so that you can start it off right and what starts off right ends right amen praise god do it in the right way amen maybe you you may not be one that that's going to be married but god will put that in you that you won't want to be married there's nothing wrong with that they're sisters husband a man that have never been married before and they feel at peace with that paul said i wish that you were just like like him he was never married and he was the messenger of the age right but when you have that desire hey listen it's time for me to to settle down gotta have a husband i gotta have a wife amen i wanna have some children that's god placing that original thought that he had from the beginning in genesis 1 26 amen male and female created he them amen and told them to multiply and replenish the earth you are fulfilling that thought praise the lord jesus amen amen we're gonna we're gonna finish here we'll just finish with this right here so satan he introduced his thoughts to to eve and eve received them because her head was not around her head was not around let me tell you what fathers you are your daughter's head until they they're married you're your daughter's head amen so always keep that in mind and if the weasel doesn't want to come and talk to the head of the house and some something's wrong something he's up to he's up to no good yeah so whoever thoughts you receive amen you become like if you receive god's thoughts who are you think you're gonna be like god if you receive satan's thoughts who are you going to be like you're you're going to look like the world amen you're going to look like little nazex you're going to look like uh demi lovato whatever because those are the thoughts of the world amen but if you see the thoughts of god you're going to look like god you're going to act like god and you're going to even dress like god you're going to talk like god amen i wonder if if jesus walked by here at this very moment would you be ashamed of the way you even look like right now there you go would you be ashamed or would you be proud would you be happy the holy ghost led me to dress this way the holy ghost led me to act this way to look this way how would you have to hang your head low and think yeah i'm not i'm not doing right i can see even from the outside you can tell what's in the heart amen hey some some very deep deep thoughts things to think about i want to hear it to our young people because look we're not you're not getting younger i'm not getting younger the world is is is falling apart more and more the coming of the lord is soon at hand and so why are we considering dilly dallying with the world and being like the world when we should be looking more to to his thoughts god's given us the whole counsel amen we don't need to we don't need to receive the world's counsel we need to receive god's counsel you want to be like god then receive what he says in his word and when you receive what he says in his word you will act the way he said in his word you will live the way he says in his word and you will you will even look like the way he says in his word he will manifest praise the lord jesus amen let's stand to our feet amen let's sing this little song amen let's just bow our heads our gracious lord
