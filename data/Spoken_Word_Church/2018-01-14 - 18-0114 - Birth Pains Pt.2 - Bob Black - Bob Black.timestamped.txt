[0:00] take a look at this
[0:06] alright Romans 8 verse 1
[0:08] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[0:10] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[0:12] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[0:23] the law can undo and that was weak
[0:26] through the flesh God sending his own
[0:28] son in the likeness of sinful flesh ever
[0:30] seen for they that are after the flesh
[0:49] behind the things of the flesh but they
[0:51] that are after the spirit the things of
[0:53] the Spirit because the carnal mind is
[1:05] enmity against God for he does not
[1:08] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:10] can be but you're not in the flesh but
[1:18] in the spirit if so be that the Spirit
[1:20] of God dwell in you now if any man have
[1:23] not the Spirit of Christ he is none of
[1:26] his
[1:31] as insane but if the spirit of him that
[1:38] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:40] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:42] dead also shall quicken your mortal
[1:44] bodies by his Spirit if you live after
[1:56] anybody shall die but if you through the
[1:58] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[2:00] you shall leave time as invalid or you
[2:08] have not received a spirit of bondage
[2:10] again to fear but you never speak
[2:12] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:14] we cry Abba Father and the children then
[2:25] heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with
[2:27] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[2:29] that we may be also glorified together
[2:42] for the earnest expectation of the
[2:45] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[2:46] of the sons of God
[2:58] because the creature itself also shall
[3:00] be displayed bundage of corruption into
[3:02] the glorious liberty of the children of
[3:04] God and not only they but ourselves
[3:14] awesome which have the firstfruits of
[3:16] the Spirit even we ourselves groan
[3:19] within ourselves waiting for the
[3:20] adoption to wit the redemption of our
[3:23] body that is changes but if we hope for
[3:35] that we see not then do we with patience
[3:38] wait
[3:52] [Music]
[3:54] and either search at the hearts knows
[3:56] the mind of the Spirit because he maketh
[3:59] intercession for the Saints according to
[4:01] the will of God whom he did foreknow he
[4:13] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[4:16] the image of his son that he might be
[4:18] the firstborn what shall we say to these
[4:35] things who shall lay anything to the
[4:52] charge of God's elect is God that
[4:54] justifies
[5:04] [Music]
[5:10] who shall separate us from the love of
[5:12] Christ
[5:13] such tribulation or distress or
[5:15] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[5:17] peril or sword may be and all these
[5:28] things we are more than this morning I'm
[5:59] just going to continue on this topic
[6:00] over so really what I'm what I'm kind of
[6:08] going through is this Romans chapter 8
[6:12] because if you read that that's gonna
[6:15] that's a pretty deep little chapter yeah
[6:17] it's very meaty and I just have a lot of
[6:20] good things and and and one of the the
[6:24] main theme of it is how the whole create
[6:26] creation is growing we are growing and
[6:30] there's a birth that's taken place that
[6:33] the word is being born in us and it's
[6:36] producing a change to the world and this
[6:38] everything is being transformed and
[6:41] that's why you have all the growing and
[6:44] everything so last time we kind of
[6:46] looked at UM at how when you were born
[6:51] again the Spirit of God within you
[6:53] begins to recognize you begin to
[6:56] recognize who your father is and you
[6:58] know where you came from and and you
[7:01] begin as so as you begin to eat the word
[7:03] and recognize who he
[7:06] you're looking at him you get your
[7:08] sustenance from him from El Shaddai the
[7:11] the breasted one as brother talked about
[7:14] and you begin to you cried out to the
[7:17] Father to the to God and and so you can
[7:21] see in this Romans chapter eight this
[7:22] process that every believer goes through
[7:26] to growing and striving to get to this
[7:29] place where the the life of God has no
[7:33] impediment in us that we are allowing
[7:35] God to work through our members and that
[7:38] so that God can see can look at us and
[7:41] see himself made manifest the manifested
[7:44] sons of God whether it's our God is is
[7:48] there's somebody that's allowing God to
[7:50] have preeminence in their life and then
[7:54] keep on going on up until one day
[7:57] there's gonna leave that time you know I
[8:00] try not just put things off in the
[8:02] future anymore because I believe that
[8:03] now is the time where the bride is
[8:06] beginning to realize who she is and
[8:08] having an understanding of what the
[8:09] rapture is to wit the redemption of our
[8:12] body to win what has taken place how God
[8:15] has done it and an understanding that
[8:18] that there's nothing that's preventing
[8:20] you from going in the rapture and that
[8:21] takes a supernatural understanding a
[8:24] supernatural revelation to see how God
[8:27] has brought you through all these
[8:28] different very very maybe simple
[8:31] processes a simple process of
[8:33] justification sanctification bap
[8:35] technologists for your soul and then a
[8:38] cleansing of your spirit through the
[8:40] same process and then a cleansing or
[8:43] redemption of your body to get your body
[8:45] into a state and all those three very
[8:48] simple kind of little processes
[8:50] justification sanctification the baptism
[8:53] the Holy Ghost and one if you look at a
[8:56] lot of these Old Testament types you can
[8:58] see you can run it right from Genesis to
[9:01] Revelation all these different types to
[9:03] give us a better understanding and one
[9:05] of those is the story of Abraham how in
[9:07] Genesis chapter 15 god calls me he's
[9:10] he's if you want to call it like birthed
[9:12] out of out of the
[9:14] kind of the the way that his family was
[9:17] serving idols and and believed in lots
[9:20] of different gods and all that sort of
[9:22] thing and God called and said let's go
[9:24] this different direction now read on
[9:27] further down in Genesis chapter 15 and
[9:28] it talks about how that that God put him
[9:31] to sleep and and through that process of
[9:33] sanctification a type of sanctification
[9:35] in the Old Testament
[9:37] now how Abraham went through all those
[9:39] different steps he put that he put him
[9:40] to sleep and he saw the burning lamp
[9:42] going between the sacrifices and all
[9:44] those different things and keep on going
[9:46] until and genesis 17 he God he says walk
[9:51] before me and be perfect
[9:53] a type of the baptism of Holy Ghost and
[9:55] then in Genesis 18 the Son of Man
[9:59] appears God in flesh and gives him a
[10:01] promise that he's going to have a son so
[10:04] in Genesis 18 verse 9 this is the the
[10:08] story kind of that brother Brennan
[10:10] always talked about that that identify
[10:14] the son of man because we know that the
[10:17] this man was identified in brother
[10:20] brandy ministry is as he was stand
[10:21] before people and and kind of you know
[10:23] he would say that just like this man was
[10:27] able to identify Sarah in the tent
[10:28] behind him brother Brandon would stand
[10:31] there before the people and turn his
[10:32] back on the communication and call out
[10:34] things in the audience without even
[10:36] really being looking at things and so
[10:39] the son of man was identified just the
[10:41] same way as it was when the son of man
[10:43] was there with Abraham and so in Elissa
[10:46] just read this little scripture and they
[10:48] said a name whereas Sarah thy wife and
[10:50] he said behold in the tent and he said I
[10:52] will certainly return to the according
[10:54] to the town of a life and love Sarah thy
[10:56] wife shall have a son and Sarah heard
[10:59] again
[11:00] which was behind and I'm leaving off a
[11:02] lot of the different story about how
[11:03] Sarah left and so forth but I want to
[11:06] kind of bring out that that point of
[11:08] this going in a point of a lot of the
[11:09] other stories in the Old Testament is
[11:12] that Abraham was going to have a child
[11:14] Abraham is the birth of this child
[11:17] that's the main focus and so when you
[11:21] read in the Old Testament of how Abraham
[11:24] went through this process he started off
[11:26] you know just a real simple change in
[11:29] his life he took a little turn and
[11:31] before long this child was born and
[11:36] that's that's what's taking place now
[11:38] you know you hear a lot of times in
[11:40] around the message and different ones
[11:41] that wondering if if something's really
[11:43] taking place because it sometimes looks
[11:46] like there's not there's not too much
[11:48] going on hey you know you could almost
[11:50] say just kind of like a win-win to all
[11:53] the different people will look up there
[11:54] on the hill as Jesus was crucified well
[11:56] that's there's nothing too much going on
[11:58] it's just it's just a man a preacher and
[12:01] two thieves being killed but yet one of
[12:04] the greatest stories that had ever been
[12:06] told was unfolding right there so I
[12:09] think it's some of these things can seem
[12:12] very simple but yet something so great
[12:14] is is really unfolding that God is
[12:16] manifesting himself and his people so
[12:19] that's what I mean by the the main thing
[12:21] is the birth of this child another story
[12:25] is the story of Ruth where you read this
[12:26] whole the story of Ruth and and you go
[12:29] through all the different things about
[12:30] how she she came to Boaz and she made
[12:32] him in the field and and all the
[12:34] different planning of the harvest and
[12:35] all the different things that led up to
[12:37] the culmination of the very end of this
[12:39] whole story that she's gonna have this
[12:41] child the birth of his child
[12:44] you know now again just to remind what
[12:46] am I talking about when when the world
[12:48] is boarding you you begin to cry Abba
[12:49] Father good up here
[12:51] now all these bursaries are birthing you
[12:53] so it's giving birth to the learner to
[12:56] this child but then when you come up to
[12:58] the very in here there had to be
[13:00] something happen to get us to birth the
[13:03] word to get us out of here to take us
[13:05] from this world this cosmos that we're
[13:07] in with all of our carnal ideas
[13:09] everything
[13:10] to kind of jump us up into eternity so
[13:13] that so that our body would be changed
[13:15] something special had to happen and what
[13:17] that special thing was was that God sent
[13:19] a prophet that's why he came to the end
[13:21] of the age
[13:22] to keep us out of this world to preach a
[13:25] message the shout to get us to
[13:29] understanding that our bodies could be
[13:31] changed and that is the birth of the
[13:33] word that's why in that story of Abraham
[13:35] Abraham the body was changed just kind
[13:38] of a pre figure what's gonna happen for
[13:39] us and we have to see that word be born
[13:44] in us and then our bodies will be
[13:47] changed so that we can look upon heal
[13:48] will see him as he is cuz will be like
[13:51] him does the word is being born in us
[13:53] and so let's let's just look at this
[13:55] Ruth child because it talks about that
[13:58] the whole story of Ruth is leading up to
[13:59] this little culmination thing that's why
[14:01] she had to have a kinsman redeemer not
[14:04] just because it would be a grand idea so
[14:06] she'd get the land back but she had to
[14:08] have a kinsman redeemer so she could
[14:09] have this child so that her dead
[14:12] husband's name could be carried on my
[14:14] long oh I have you pronounced that I'm
[14:17] maybe not too good to pronounce the
[14:19] names but so Ruth chapter 4 verse 13
[14:23] through 17 says so boaz took ruth as she
[14:25] was his wife and when he went in unto
[14:27] her the Lord gave her conception and she
[14:28] bare a son and the woman said unto me
[14:31] only blessed be the Lord which have not
[14:33] left thee this day without a kinsman
[14:35] that his name may be famous in Israel
[14:38] because without now thinking about us
[14:40] without a kinsman without a way to take
[14:44] you back from to where that Adam had
[14:47] fallen from just like a little egg
[14:50] Naomi's husband had had left his
[14:53] inheritance you had to have a way to get
[14:55] you back to your heritage so the kinsman
[14:58] the reason you have a kinsman is to
[15:00] restore to you the what was followed to
[15:04] bring forth and really but that's what
[15:07] was hidden in the back part of God mind
[15:09] was that his eternal purpose to manifest
[15:11] himself in
[15:13] children to bring four children and make
[15:15] himself manifest in them and and so
[15:18] that's why that's really you know think
[15:22] about that how how really deep that is
[15:24] why you really needed at kinsman we
[15:26] needed a kinsman to be saved but the
[15:28] ultimate goal of salvation is for God to
[15:30] make men himself manifest and his people
[15:34] and he shall be under the a restorer of
[15:37] thy life and a nurture of that old age
[15:39] for that daughter and all which loveth e
[15:42] which is better to these than seven sons
[15:44] hath morning better than these and seven
[15:47] sons now here you know in the Old
[15:49] Testament you've got all these are these
[15:50] messengers Eleazar to Rebecca the the
[15:53] chief Reaper and the story of Ruth and
[15:56] and you know even in the New Testament
[15:58] you got all these ones these messengers
[16:01] that came upon the scene to prepare a
[16:03] bride for Christ now which is more
[16:06] important now this is this was a little
[16:08] bit controversial I imagine but you know
[16:12] as these messenger came on the scene
[16:14] what they're trying to do is produce a
[16:15] bride produce a bride that looks just
[16:18] like another masterpiece that looks just
[16:21] like the original man pass in which is
[16:24] Jesus Christ and so this bride is better
[16:27] and don't triple up on the work better
[16:31] let's see all these seven churches
[16:33] messengers they're trying to produce
[16:36] their aim was not just to have a
[16:38] messenger kind of set over to the side
[16:40] and say well there's the messenger
[16:42] that's the goal is the bride right so
[16:46] the bride is better to these than seven
[16:49] sons
[16:49] the bride is the focus and a lot of
[16:52] times we we get so tripped up over where
[16:54] we another day in the days of John
[16:56] Wesley I'm sure so many looked at him
[16:58] and said well that's the focus is I
[17:00] believe that God sent a man to the south
[17:03] but they may be so many of them lost
[17:05] sight of the the purpose of his message
[17:07] was for the people to grab a whole tooth
[17:10] and believe it and each one of these
[17:13] messengers came on the scene then we're
[17:14] preparing a bride to get ready and
[17:18] that's what the focus is yeah
[17:20] and now I know I think you know after
[17:22] the shower and out then in that kind of
[17:26] the the sequence of what the rapture is
[17:29] a shout the voice of the Archangel and
[17:31] that's that's kind of where I'm going is
[17:33] that something in that in that period of
[17:37] the voice when the the voice of the
[17:39] Archangel all wrapped up in that is a
[17:41] birth pain that's pushing forth
[17:43] something's happening something's
[17:45] happening to the bride the bride is
[17:46] catching a hold of who she is and what's
[17:49] taking place and so they and they only
[17:53] took the child and later there's a
[17:54] better bosom and became nursing unto it
[17:56] Emily Emily no kind of the type of how
[17:58] that works is that as the word the birth
[18:00] of the word comes forth the bride is
[18:02] gonna hand it over to 144,000 hand over
[18:06] the word the same word that we've heard
[18:07] and Naomi that you know the old Israel
[18:10] is gonna the one that was before the
[18:12] ogre is gonna take it and run with it
[18:13] so to speak yeah and the women her
[18:16] neighbors gave it a name saying there is
[18:18] a son born to Naomi and they called his
[18:20] name OB he is the father of Jesse the
[18:23] father of David so open it really if you
[18:27] want to put it like this that's that's
[18:28] the purpose of this whole book of Ruth
[18:30] is getting this son produced which I'm
[18:33] typing it as the word does that make
[18:35] sense to everybody and so let's get back
[18:41] to where we were even Roma's eight eight
[18:43] fifteen because this is what this whole
[18:45] this whole little lesson is about birth
[18:47] pains bringing the word for Romans 8:15
[18:50] says for you have not received the
[18:52] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[18:54] never received the spirit of
[18:56] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the
[18:59] spirit of adoption that's growing within
[19:01] you and to produce a child of God that
[19:04] is not a child anymore but grow up into
[19:06] material not a little baby running
[19:08] around not knowing what's going on so
[19:10] that's what that's what that this is a
[19:12] spirit of adoption producing in you an
[19:14] adopted son of God if you let it
[19:17] now there's the key in your letter if we
[19:19] let it as I put myself in there to you
[19:22] of course absolutely we're all
[19:24] struggling and groaning and striving to
[19:26] allow going to have it
[19:28] so let's kind of break this down and you
[19:32] have received the spirit of adoption but
[19:33] why we whereby we cry Abba Father so
[19:36] there's there's something within you
[19:38] crying after you get the nerve new birth
[19:40] when the new birth is born in you is the
[19:42] spirit crying in you and and it's crying
[19:45] out first of all he's crying and it's
[19:48] crying out Abba Father because it
[19:50] recognizes the word it recognizes itself
[19:53] and Abba is a personal a personal
[19:57] reference to who God is it's not just
[20:01] kind of something that you've learned by
[20:02] giving a good thing a logical
[20:04] understanding but it's a personal
[20:06] revelation revelation to you who God is
[20:08] like like we're never Billy Paul talking
[20:10] about here is Danny crying in prayer and
[20:13] and he was calling out Papa God because
[20:15] God was not just something that he read
[20:18] about but he was a personal actual an
[20:20] actual person that he was fellowshiping
[20:22] with yeah and so when you're born you
[20:25] the first thing that kind of
[20:27] illustrating the last time is that when
[20:29] you when you're born again and in modern
[20:32] society in and the movies and whatnot we
[20:34] we get the idea that the daddy ain't
[20:36] nowhere to be found you know that Dave's
[20:38] pacing outside or whatever and all this
[20:40] is going on with the birth inside and
[20:42] and they don't really want nothing to do
[20:44] with that but in the gospel I believe
[20:46] it's imminent because when you're born
[20:47] again you come out looking at thank God
[20:49] you come out seeing who he is and we're
[20:53] not born an ed brother Wade was bringing
[20:55] out the last Sunday afternoon you're not
[20:56] born from some creed and Dom or whatever
[20:59] you got born from a woman I mean think
[21:03] about how that that would just be a
[21:06] messed up picture but you're born from
[21:09] the word you're born from the father
[21:11] you're born from God and you come out
[21:14] looking at God and so this is this is at
[21:16] the bottom you come out looking at God
[21:18] down here well what about here yeah cuz
[21:21] this is supposed to produce God in flesh
[21:23] the son of man back again in his people
[21:26] in his church
[21:29] so it's see how at the bottom it's it
[21:34] kind of mirrors what happens at the top
[21:36] of the pyramid at the at crying our
[21:38] Father mirrors what happens to with the
[21:40] undertook to with the adoption it's it
[21:43] it's the same process
[21:45] that's what's so confusing it goes up to
[21:47] the to the wives of the world is that it
[21:50] is the simplicity of the gospel see how
[21:52] simple it really is I love it
[21:56] brother I'm said on identification he
[21:58] said and now God expresses himself
[22:00] himself through his son Christ Jesus as
[22:02] he takes us in as adopted children and
[22:04] put his spirit in us cry Abba Father or
[22:07] in other words my God my God and things
[22:10] that are to be he said we have become
[22:11] for moral beings from time beings to
[22:14] eternal beings when the Word of God let
[22:17] our souls and we become sons and
[22:18] daughters of God with the attributes the
[22:20] gene of God in us to be sons and
[22:22] daughters of the father God in heaven
[22:23] crying Abba Father my God my god in my
[22:26] father's house and so what Roman's we
[22:30] already we just read that as we kind of
[22:31] go through the responsive reading how
[22:33] Romans 8 talks about going from carnal
[22:36] to spiritual from being birthed and
[22:39] Romans 8:5 8 says that the righteousness
[22:42] of the law might be filled fulfilled in
[22:44] us who walk not after the flesh but
[22:45] after the spirit for they that are after
[22:48] the flesh do mind the things of the
[22:50] flesh but they that are after the spirit
[22:51] the things of the Spirit for to be
[22:53] carnally minded is death but to be
[22:55] spiritually minded is life and peace
[22:57] because the carnal mind is enmity
[22:59] against God for and is not subject to
[23:01] the law of God neither indeed can be so
[23:04] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[23:05] please God but ye are not in the flesh
[23:07] but in the spirit if so be that the
[23:10] Spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[23:12] man have not the Spirit of Christ he is
[23:14] none of his and you know it that's why
[23:17] it's so important to have a new birth
[23:19] the new birth is the most important
[23:20] thing that you can have because without
[23:22] that you don't have the teacher inside
[23:24] of you to recognize the word
[23:25] identify yourself with the word and to
[23:28] open the word to you that's why so many
[23:30] and there Carl ideas they argue about
[23:32] the word yeah that's why I'm convinced
[23:36] that you cannot reason somebody into the
[23:38] message or reason somebody into seeing
[23:41] the correct way of the Bible and that's
[23:43] why man cannot really interpret the Word
[23:46] of God it takes a revelation of this of
[23:48] the Spirit to reveal it to someone yeah
[23:51] it's not something that you debate and
[23:53] argue somebody into but if if we just
[23:56] open ourselves up over the doors of our
[23:57] heart to receive a revelation of God
[24:00] then he'll he's able to teach us and
[24:02] that caused us to understand but on the
[24:05] other hand you must you must read you
[24:07] must study for yourself you must go to
[24:09] church and make yourself available and
[24:12] that's you know all those different kind
[24:14] of things it is very difficult to really
[24:16] Express and let's just keep going
[24:21] yeah well I'm against organized religion
[24:24] whether I'm said oh it doesn't exactly
[24:27] mean that when a man says that get away
[24:29] from him God watches over his word you
[24:31] know the Bible says just the way it
[24:32] should be see now it puts in such a way
[24:35] to deceive or to make the wise stumble
[24:37] the race so simpler that the reason they
[24:39] stumble or receive I keep reading and
[24:42] that birth is from beneath this earth is
[24:44] from the earth and it is guessed the
[24:45] Spirit of God the first birth to make us
[24:47] active here makes us mortal man because
[24:49] of the sin act of the guard and make man
[24:51] come into the world by a woman and a man
[24:53] that is born of a woman is a few days of
[24:56] a man that is born of Christ is eternal
[24:58] and he kind of keeps going on that line
[25:01] up the difference between man's wisdom
[25:03] and the inner revelation from God
[25:06] somebody could could stay in and out
[25:08] argue you but it won't be a revelation
[25:13] then when a man is born again from
[25:15] heaven he said then who is this milk is
[25:17] a day he becomes a spirit baby Christ
[25:19] and then
[25:20] this road will fleshes drop there's a
[25:21] natural body theophany a body not made
[25:24] with hands neither born of a woman that
[25:25] we come to not boy of a woman because
[25:28] you're not born of a woman you're born
[25:30] from from God that's what the new birth
[25:33] is you're born from a woman that can
[25:35] kind of get into that wife you know like
[25:37] like some ask what's the difference
[25:39] between the message and the denomination
[25:41] because if you're only from any
[25:44] denomination you're going to have a
[25:45] woman then you're over that book of
[25:47] Revelation it talks about that mother
[25:49] holes and all these all these little
[25:50] harlots that came out from that so you
[25:52] can't be born from that now you can't be
[25:55] born again if you're I believe that you
[25:58] could hear a little bit of snippet of
[25:59] work be born again into the sitting in a
[26:01] denomination but then you've got to come
[26:03] out of that denomination because you
[26:05] can't sit there among all of that but
[26:08] but see we see what the denomination is
[26:10] is as the word came forward that they
[26:12] started out in the first days Paul came
[26:14] out preaching and and everybody kind of
[26:16] cabbage down drew up drew all the lines
[26:19] and everything and said now we got it
[26:21] right here and when they form that that
[26:23] denomination drew the line around it
[26:25] then it died and something had another
[26:28] message had to come out to get people
[26:29] out of that SOI arenas came along and he
[26:32] preached his message and out from that
[26:34] old denominational system that they had
[26:36] formed came out of another group and it
[26:38] just keep kept coming on coming on as
[26:40] they would form a little denomination
[26:42] they would say well now we got it we're
[26:44] gonna draw up what Irina's believed and
[26:47] draw up martin believed and just kept
[26:49] going on we got it all pinned down and
[26:51] then it would it would die and so when
[26:54] you when it dies because god keeps
[26:56] moving home his word keeps moving home
[26:59] through all the different pieces of the
[27:00] all the different stages of that wheat
[27:03] plant
[27:03] that corner week the tassel that shoved
[27:06] all the different stages and so we have
[27:08] to keep moving
[27:09] along with that it once it's denominated
[27:13] it can't bring forth life again fairway
[27:17] or form to the paragraph 80 says here we
[27:20] go forms of the word image to be a
[27:21] particular the word feed on what about
[27:23] being predestinated assess the beginning
[27:25] you see that little spark of life that
[27:27] you having you from the beginning when
[27:28] you started your journey many of you can
[27:31] remember it you join this church and
[27:32] join that church you try this and that
[27:34] nothing satisfied that's right but one
[27:37] day you just recognized it right and
[27:42] here in the mark of the beast' program
[27:44] started about how your heart as a room
[27:45] and the woman holds the seed and sees
[27:48] the gospel no matter how many of you may
[27:50] lose your shadow door no matter how
[27:51] great your pastor is and how much you
[27:54] read the Bible I'll never take live
[27:55] until the germ of life has come to it so
[27:58] no matter how much you know the Bible
[27:59] and how well it is in your heart you're
[28:00] still a sinner the heart is a womb and
[28:03] faith cometh by opening you that's not
[28:04] been sealed by theology faith cometh by
[28:07] hearing hearing and then he talks about
[28:11] it gets down to the bottom of the blood
[28:13] of Christ is applied in the blood comes
[28:14] a German life that goes into the seed
[28:17] and brings forth a newborn baby crying I
[28:19] have a father I have a father my God my
[28:22] God why did I ever do those things my
[28:24] God my God not from a denomination cuz
[28:28] he talks about how she can't paragraph
[28:30] 87 she can't bring forth nothing but
[28:33] dead children then if a denomination can
[28:35] only bring forth a hybrid child why do
[28:37] you want to belong to it for a now
[28:39] brother and that's the reason I'm
[28:40] against it she's a homework to begin
[28:43] with the Bible said she was a harlot
[28:45] that's plain words but I told you I was
[28:47] going to talk plain today that's what
[28:49] she is
[28:49] be she commits spiritual fornications by
[28:52] the dogma and Creed instead of the word
[28:54] teach your children to do the same thing
[28:57] now her children are come from the womb
[28:59] dead she's got to die that's exactly
[29:03] right just the same as every man analyst
[29:05] and just as sure as every moral person
[29:07] that breaks the womb of a woman will die
[29:10] so with so will every person that's
[29:12] borne by them will die because she's a
[29:14] hybrid illegitimate and her children are
[29:17] illegitimate that's correct
[29:18] I hope that don't go over your head now
[29:21] the reason I believe that one of the
[29:23] reasons why brother Graham put so much
[29:24] emphasis so I'm not on how on the
[29:27] denomination and what what's going on
[29:29] here is because now and we get closer to
[29:32] the end to this birth there's there
[29:35] comes a time where there's no
[29:36] denominational system involved at all
[29:39] they come straight from God straight
[29:41] down accomplish from God straight into a
[29:43] prophet and the people receive it and
[29:45] and it's a virgin bride that receives
[29:48] the word has nothing to do with the
[29:49] denomination right yeah some were come
[29:52] out from the nomination some were raised
[29:54] in the message of course even if you're
[29:56] raising the message you if you had your
[29:57] own line isn't everything that you had
[29:59] to come out of so we'll say even even
[30:01] the ones of us that were raised the
[30:03] message we came out of our own little
[30:05] denominational ideas as well but in the
[30:07] end of this birth this birth is coming
[30:10] forth there ain't no man involved with
[30:12] it I think nothing is straight born
[30:15] directly from God to produce the word in
[30:24] flesh again the son of man made manifest
[30:27] you know we were looking at son man and
[30:30] in Abraham's day and really you follow
[30:32] the pattern of the son of man revealing
[30:34] himself it three times and came to the
[30:37] Abraham our spiritual you know the
[30:41] father the faith and so forth and he was
[30:43] there where I'm talking about that and
[30:45] the message Jehovah Jireh and other
[30:47] messages about the son man God in flesh
[30:49] talking to Abraham I didn't find himself
[30:51] answering the tent behind it and then he
[30:53] came again to the natural seed of
[30:55] Abraham on the on the shores of Galilee
[30:57] God walking in a veil in human flesh of
[31:00] Jesus and then he comes and the son of
[31:02] man again in this day to the royal seed
[31:05] of Abraham producing himself back in
[31:07] flesh again so
[31:10] and I'm bouncing around a little bit I
[31:14] got a little bit off-topic there but I
[31:16] just kind of want to share that with you
[31:17] because all this kind of stuff it I
[31:20] wanted message together yeah I know it's
[31:23] a lot of information this morning right
[31:25] but everything just kind of the birth of
[31:28] the word is producing God in flesh me
[31:30] and the spoken word is the original seed
[31:32] brother REM said the true body there's
[31:35] gonna be one she's predestinated she
[31:37] won't be denominated because she's
[31:39] predestinated see she don't have to
[31:40] worry about some denomination she's
[31:43] already predicted to take the place look
[31:45] like Mary when Christ comes to his bride
[31:48] she will be a virgin like Mary was for
[31:51] God will not bring Christ through a womb
[31:53] on a I neither will he bring the
[31:56] bride he can't bring his word through a
[31:58] of his word there was horrible
[32:01] words but that's what the Bible says
[32:04] brother Brad was a pretty straight away
[32:09] so you say is it the bride he saying
[32:14] exactly what I've just covered there and
[32:16] the spoken word is the original seed
[32:18] again he says that when his bride comes
[32:20] she will be the same product that he is
[32:21] virgin the Christ belong to a
[32:24] denomination did you hope when him is
[32:26] his bride she is part of him she needs
[32:28] no table Douglas you won't have him
[32:30] she'll be absolutely virgin how by the
[32:33] word amen she'll punctuate every word
[32:35] God says man amen amen
[32:38] be done to me according to thy word oh
[32:40] my there you are punctuate god's word
[32:42] have a virgin woman what would she come
[32:45] out of a virgin one of the word what did
[32:47] Jesus come out of a virgin woman and
[32:50] just like this little picture of Mary
[32:53] coming to bring the could come into
[32:56] Jerusalem of Bethlehem to be able to
[32:58] deliver this baby see we have all these
[33:02] stories in the Old Testament of these
[33:04] women that were speaking Rebecca spoke
[33:07] to Eleazar all these women that were
[33:09] make it hannah confessing to Lila and
[33:13] making their confession and bringing
[33:16] forth a child and all these speak of
[33:19] what we are doing in this day be it unto
[33:22] me important
[33:23] bringing forth a child the babies born
[33:26] from a virgin womb and that's what's
[33:27] happening in this day as you cry I have
[33:30] a father making a confession that you
[33:32] believe the word and you just keep
[33:34] speaking and the word used they'll work
[33:37] I believe the bride around the world is
[33:39] speaking our self into a body change as
[33:42] the ministers that Paul said the
[33:44] ministry or the steward ships of the
[33:46] mysteries of the stewards of the
[33:47] mysteries of God and all around the
[33:48] world the bride The ministers have taken
[33:51] on the taken what brandon has preached
[33:54] and a preaching the gospel like this
[33:57] showing people these these types and
[34:00] things that brother Branham spoke about
[34:02] but couldn't quite didn't have maybe
[34:03] time to get into all the different
[34:05] things of what was taking place and and
[34:07] you know really it was hidden because it
[34:09] s anyway priest of seven seals these
[34:11] feasts made comments about how the
[34:12] people didn't get it and it was the
[34:15] people will begin to get it right about
[34:17] the time they come into the Lord so I
[34:19] believe now is the time for us to see
[34:21] who we are in the hour that we're living
[34:22] in then the word is being born not in
[34:25] just a baby form but now it's become to
[34:27] the come to maturity when maturity of
[34:30] the gospel the bride is coming to a
[34:32] place where she is it has allowed the
[34:36] word to to have complete preeminence in
[34:39] her life and and you know summer at
[34:43] different stages and so forth we know
[34:45] that but what's happening is that the
[34:47] the word is being born God vindicated to
[34:52] be true he said in the seed is not able
[34:53] to shut sure is fulfilling this age when
[34:55] the seven seals are just proving the
[34:57] denomination's has just been carriers
[34:59] that's another one of the father's
[35:00] business to proof like Jesus said I must
[35:02] be about my father's business and that's
[35:05] fantastic I just want to point that out
[35:07] the father's business is to prove that
[35:10] the denominational system is just
[35:12] carriers they're carrying the word alone
[35:14] but in this last day there's gonna be a
[35:17] people that come out of that they're
[35:19] virgin born they're not they don't
[35:21] shackle down to this earth by Creed's
[35:23] and dogmas or anything but they've been
[35:25] loosed and they're gonna be so loosed
[35:27] from the things of this world that they
[35:28] take flight that's right when the
[35:30] father's business now
[35:31] is to show you that then the nominations
[35:34] is not he is there a man-made system
[35:37] that did not have the worker right you
[35:39] said well married of a great virgin that
[35:41] the cross he never called her mother he
[35:43] called her woman carrier not mother see
[35:45] true she was a carrier of the word but
[35:47] she was not the word he was the word oh
[35:49] yes notice also she does not identified
[35:51] in the resurrection with him he died and
[35:54] rose again because he was the word she
[35:56] was just a carrier she died and still in
[35:58] the grave that's right so she was just a
[36:00] carrier not as a mother not God she was
[36:02] just a carrier like the churches are
[36:04] that's right shows she was just a
[36:06] carrier not the word I know that's a
[36:09] little bit of confusing statement to me
[36:11] because you know that you start getting
[36:13] in your head well Mary was not saved or
[36:16] Mary was not part of the bride cuz you
[36:19] know keep going down and maybe was part
[36:21] of the upper room
[36:22] or only or whatever she was when she
[36:24] received the new birth she received the
[36:26] new birth and became part of the body of
[36:28] Christ but looking at it in tight though
[36:31] like this this up this wheat plant
[36:33] growing up the word the kernel of wheat
[36:36] was in her womb but she at that time
[36:41] well let me say this right she was not
[36:46] that corn of wheat the corn of wheat was
[36:48] all of the father at all everything all
[36:52] of that eternal God bottled up in that
[36:54] little baby that was gonna come forth
[36:57] from her you see and so just like in the
[36:59] in the New Testament there's that
[37:01] process of different ones that are care
[37:04] that they like the ones that just kind
[37:06] of come along that didn't could not
[37:08] quite see as the word was eaten down
[37:11] they couldn't quite see clearly
[37:13] everything about God and so in each one
[37:17] goes from one stage to another who to
[37:19] stop the the the tassel formed right
[37:25] here and I know this is a corn planet at
[37:29] which you know with the corn of wheat is
[37:31] really a corn wheat not corn of a year
[37:35] of kkona to eat but you know you can
[37:38] look at a corner
[37:39] corn grow it out in the field and learn
[37:41] a lot about a wheat plant - so let's not
[37:44] get hung up on that so but what he's
[37:49] trying to say is that the the corn of
[37:51] the week was that thought baby that's
[37:53] being born and so that you look at today
[37:56] the same process is happening again that
[37:59] in this age in this day that quart of
[38:02] wheat is being produced again yes the
[38:06] birth of the word again I'm about to run
[38:10] out of time
[38:11] y'all hang along with me just a few more
[38:13] minutes and we'll be done I know this is
[38:16] a little bit a little bit wavy and
[38:18] everything right before we get into the
[38:20] service so maybe just take some of these
[38:22] things that Mateo and and maybe go
[38:24] through the book of Romans 8 and think
[38:26] about some of the things that were
[38:27] saying and and so forth the seed isn't
[38:32] and not a aware the sugar burger and
[38:34] said she was the true seed she was
[38:36] beyond that she was the shuck that
[38:37] brought forth the grainy now the other
[38:39] two was carriers of life only as the
[38:41] natural seed marry now remember I said
[38:43] the other two now marry don't make her
[38:45] God if some people tries to make her she
[38:47] was not a God it was her she was only a
[38:49] carrier I see like the rest of them was
[38:51] but like faith in the word brilliantly
[38:54] worn to the real image P like as the
[38:57] corn matures the wheat comes forth or
[38:59] stopped and it comes forth alone when it
[39:02] comes forth a shuck but when you think
[39:04] that shut if you don't watch it'll look
[39:06] just exactly like the real weed but when
[39:09] that's opened up the real wheat is on
[39:10] the inside
[39:11] it's only a carrier again so you see
[39:13] Mary not through sex but through faith
[39:15] something exactly like it Mary was not
[39:17] that seed Mary was a carrier of the seed
[39:19] he was the genuine faith see because the
[39:22] Word of God is by faith and he give to
[39:25] Abraham and only faith can produce what
[39:28] God said he do faith in his word
[39:32] so you know what let's just go and stop
[39:35] brother and we'll just continue all next
[39:37] time
