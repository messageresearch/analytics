[0:08] good morning
[0:11] thank the lord again be able to come
[0:14] together to worship
[0:16] amen we're going to read from psalms
[0:20] 103 verses 1 through 17.
[0:25] you know i would listen to brother brown
[0:28] he was then
[0:29] talking about people being healing he
[0:31] said the first thing is to call jesus
[0:34] on the scene right because
[0:37] jesus and sickness won't stay in the
[0:39] same place right now
[0:40] so let's just remember every day
[0:43] we pray that's what we do cause jesus on
[0:46] the scene first
[0:47] before we start asking for what we need
[0:50] let's let's pray if you will heavenly
[0:53] father
[0:54] again today we are thankful
[0:57] lord for having the knowledge and
[0:59] understanding of your word
[1:01] lord let it be a revelation to be
[1:02] manifest in our hearts
[1:04] father for these words that we read are
[1:07] your words
[1:08] lord and we pray that they will help us
[1:11] to grow
[1:12] learn to be strong lord to love one
[1:14] another always
[1:16] god as you have loved us and still do
[1:18] father we thank you
[1:20] we actually remember those that in the
[1:22] sun and school class this morning
[1:24] father they're young and finding a start
[1:28] into understanding your word lord and
[1:30] just be with them
[1:31] lord we ask you to be with the pastor
[1:34] brother dale this morning
[1:35] or then bless him in a special way that
[1:38] he may deliver unto us
[1:39] things that we have need to understand
[1:42] in jesus christ and we pray
[1:44] amen psalm
[1:48] 103
[1:52] bless the lord o my soul and all that is
[1:54] within me
[1:55] bless his holy name
[2:03] who forgiveth our thine iniquities who
[2:05] healeth all thy diseases
[2:15] who satisfy that mouth with good thing
[2:18] so that thy youth
[2:19] is renewed like the eagles
[2:24] righteousness
[2:28] he made known all his ways unto moses
[2:31] his acts unto the children of
[2:35] lord is israel in gracious soul and
[2:38] anger
[2:38] and punishment he will not always say
[2:43] neither will he keep his anger forever
[2:54] for as the heavens is high above the
[2:56] earth
[2:57] so great is his mercies toward them that
[3:00] fear him
[3:09] like as the father pitteth his church so
[3:12] the lord pitteth them that fear him
[3:21] as for a man his eyes are as grass his
[3:24] days
[3:25] is as of grass as a flower of the field
[3:29] so he flourishes
[3:39] but the mercies of the lord is from
[3:42] everlasting to everlasting
[3:45] upon them that fear him and his
[3:48] righteousness unto the children's church
[3:52] god bless receive it

[4:23] don't you
[4:24] good to see everybody in the house of
[4:26] the lord we had a real good
[4:28] time yesterday at the fellowship meeting
[4:31] and all a little
[4:32] hard driving and going but it was worth
[4:34] it also that's great for all of us
[4:37] so just remember that we appreciate all
[4:39] of it
[4:40] and all the announcements remember that
[4:42] they're downstairs being run continually
[4:45] so
[4:45] remember the brothers for the uh uh
[4:48] fishing time and the sisters for your
[4:52] uh painting i think they're gonna learn
[4:54] how to paint
[4:56] well we're going fishing so maybe they
[4:58] can paint us some fish where we can eat
[5:00] some
[5:01] you know that's who probably needs
[5:04] something but
[5:05] anyhow but that's good uh announcement
[5:08] too now the playground will not be open
[5:10] this afternoon okay
[5:12] stays closed all day because richard was
[5:14] up cleaning up yesterday
[5:16] and found about four little snakes so
[5:19] we're going to have to search the whole
[5:21] thing to make sure that there's nothing
[5:23] out there
[5:24] but you know no problem we'll just go
[5:27] through and
[5:28] and you may smell some uh stuff on the
[5:30] playground for a little bit put in some
[5:32] places to try to drive them out but
[5:34] which we'll make sure because it you
[5:36] know this is you you're cleaning leaves
[5:38] up you're going to find little snakes
[5:39] it's not
[5:40] something no problem but we don't want
[5:41] you out there running screaming across
[5:43] the parking lot and get hurt
[5:45] caught us on the low snake that crawls
[5:47] up you know
[5:48] that's uh this makes you're okay all
[5:51] right we'll do that so
[5:52] remember any other announcement let's
[5:54] see we got
[5:57] i guess that's all of them what i was
[5:58] going to do is you you just go ahead and
[6:00] be seated because we got
[6:01] something a little bit different this
[6:02] morning that's going to be
[6:04] and uh now number one uh
[6:07] i've noticed that sometimes we i want to
[6:10] move something
[6:11] all right and i know everybody's got all
[6:14] their stuff so what
[6:15] i want to move this all right
[6:19] y'all put it where you want it well see
[6:22] what's ministered we're going to lay
[6:23] ours down here and then
[6:26] you start trying to find your notes and
[6:29] you're finding everybody else's songs
[6:31] and
[6:32] everybody else laying over here so if
[6:34] you would please just
[6:36] leave that thing laying somewhere or do
[6:38] something with it i don't know
[6:39] if you need it put it up here i don't
[6:42] care as long as it ain't here because
[6:43] you get your notes mixed up
[6:44] you watch a preacher a lot of times we
[6:46] are preaching he'd be and he's hunting
[6:48] because he
[6:49] he doesn't got mixed up with all your
[6:50] singing so you know do that if you would
[6:54] but um two it's really something i
[6:56] thought about this the other night
[6:58] and uh i thought we'd do it this morning
[7:02] and what i want to do is just give you a
[7:04] few scriptures
[7:06] and then brother joe is going to come
[7:07] out and do a little presentation that we
[7:10] do every once in a while
[7:12] that you know we're we try to do the
[7:15] best we can and i know that we
[7:18] everybody's always talking about you're
[7:19] hunting for the life seed
[7:21] for life's person the life one to come
[7:23] in etc
[7:25] and uh you know we all are and
[7:28] a lot of times we can't go but it's like
[7:30] brother
[7:31] i think brother henry greene made the
[7:33] statement if you can't go send somebody
[7:36] you know so we've had an opportunity
[7:38] here to be able to travel
[7:40] some and all and wades are done real
[7:43] good and some of these other brothers
[7:44] but
[7:45] aaron and them they've traveled some you
[7:47] know out of the country and
[7:48] and all and uh we thank god for that we
[7:51] appreciate it because it's getting the
[7:53] gospel out
[7:54] but i just thought well we need to just
[7:56] really show
[7:58] you know that there is uh and he'll show
[8:00] it in a minute
[8:01] there's 196 countries
[8:05] according to the paper they have in the
[8:07] world
[8:08] and do you know from lula's website
[8:11] we have touched
[8:16] 191 countries
[8:21] i mean just one of those and if people
[8:24] look at our thing day to day and they
[8:25] shine
[8:26] well we put a little of our money into
[8:29] doing the best we could
[8:31] and i'm sorry out there on the internet
[8:33] system a lot of times
[8:34] that you know you don't get to get the
[8:36] pretty big pretty pictures and the
[8:38] pretty
[8:39] things that you see in all these other
[8:40] churches but
[8:42] uh we are doing the best we can to try
[8:44] to get the message out
[8:46] and if it skips and jumps and everything
[8:49] well that's
[8:49] i'm sorry uh it ain't always our fault
[8:53] it's a lot of times it's the servers and
[8:55] the things that's doing that
[8:57] and uh you know but we're not trying to
[8:59] put on a beautiful
[9:01] thing we're trying to just go ahead and
[9:03] preach the gospel
[9:04] at the world whatever wants to listen
[9:06] listen but see in
[9:08] mark jesus said one day he said go ye
[9:11] into all the world
[9:12] and preach the gospel to every creature
[9:16] all right then he goes back in matthew
[9:18] 24 and he says
[9:20] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[9:22] preached
[9:23] in all the world for a witness unto all
[9:27] nations
[9:28] and then shall the end come coming on
[9:30] down right
[9:32] all right in colossians 1 23 paul is
[9:36] talking about
[9:38] the hope of the gospel which you have
[9:40] heard which was preached now watch
[9:42] to every creature that is under heaven
[9:45] brother branham i remember him saying it
[9:47] seeing it said here in the scripture
[9:49] which was preached to every creature
[9:51] which is under heaven now brother brown
[9:54] said paul
[9:55] touched the known world of his day
[9:59] all right the gospel went out that was
[10:01] the beginning
[10:02] and we're here in the end toward it says
[10:04] in and the end of all things has come
[10:07] upon us you know the end here and the
[10:10] gospel is going out
[10:11] to the world of these the believers of
[10:14] the message that are doing the best they
[10:15] can
[10:16] to try to to get the message out
[10:19] and all and knowing that
[10:22] like i said we can't go but we the money
[10:25] you put in
[10:25] is what sends these out to minister
[10:29] and what sins on a monthly basis to help
[10:32] these people
[10:34] and all and we just recently sent to
[10:37] a large chunk of money to the
[10:40] philippines to type into
[10:42] a lot of the doings and from a little
[10:44] church like this
[10:46] it was a large track of money all right
[10:49] but uh you know we appreciate it
[10:50] appreciate all the work that's done
[10:53] as a matter of fact i was against years
[10:55] ago
[10:56] of the internet system that's what's
[10:58] going on the internet
[11:00] i was against that and and i wouldn't
[11:03] have it
[11:04] well the brothers one day they kept on
[11:06] and some of them just kept talking and
[11:08] they said well just
[11:09] let us put it on what we can do and uh
[11:13] okay that's y'all i'll pay for
[11:15] everything whatever you need but
[11:17] you know no problem but that's up to you
[11:20] because i'm not trying to
[11:21] to be a worldwide preacher uh i refuse
[11:24] to be pastor of anybody other than this
[11:27] group of people we have here
[11:28] and some that do count us their pastor
[11:31] that sends their tithe to us
[11:33] these you know that that cannot be here
[11:36] you know but only a couple of those
[11:40] because i won't do it you get on the
[11:42] internet and you get into a lot of
[11:43] problems and all
[11:45] and i knew that from the beginning but
[11:46] god has been so gracious to us
[11:49] we have had over uh
[11:53] the years that we've been on the
[11:54] internet we've had one comment
[11:59] a question or a thought back because of
[12:01] something i said about an individual
[12:03] minister
[12:04] one time and uh you know
[12:08] i thought quick as we opened it up and
[12:10] and allowed that to happen that we'd be
[12:12] flooded
[12:13] with all kinds of things you know but
[12:15] it's god has been good to us
[12:17] but i'd like for jophie wood just to
[12:19] come and just let you
[12:21] see what you think that you're not doing
[12:24] much but your money and your half
[12:26] helping and your offense and the thing
[12:29] and and going
[12:30] is really doing a great thing and i want
[12:33] him to
[12:33] come ahead and brother joe and give it
[12:35] to him
[12:38] good morning everyone we love the lord
[12:41] amen
[12:41] amen um i like what brother richard
[12:45] douglas always says
[12:47] jesus loves you and i love you too
[12:51] i wanted to give uh just a quick little
[12:53] overview of
[12:54] um some things that um
[12:57] are going out from here you know it's
[13:00] it's their motive and desire to
[13:03] establish the word of god in the hearts
[13:06] of the people
[13:07] and i can't do it myself as far as using
[13:10] our tools and technology and those kind
[13:12] of things
[13:13] but i have a great team
[13:16] of of brothers that band together to
[13:19] have one heart and one mind and our
[13:22] objective and what we do is to glorify
[13:24] jesus christ
[13:26] and so um but you know a lot of times
[13:29] in all of our lives we have things
[13:32] behind the scenes that we do that other
[13:34] people don't see
[13:35] and until you sit down and you talk to
[13:37] people and you kind of lay out you know
[13:40] what you do you don't really realize
[13:41] what is going on behind the scenes so i
[13:44] wanted to share a couple of things with
[13:45] you
[13:46] um of course we we have a website but we
[13:49] try to
[13:50] focus more on the sermons that are
[13:52] published the quotes the
[13:54] the audio those kind of things um you
[13:57] know you can make a
[13:58] website pretty and and however you want
[14:01] to design it
[14:02] but your objective should be to get the
[14:05] message of jesus christ
[14:06] to other people and we live in an age
[14:09] where
[14:10] that's possible uh through you know
[14:12] technology and other things like that we
[14:14] were listening to the book of acts on
[14:16] the way to church
[14:18] and in acts chapter 6 it was talking
[14:20] about philip and you know the spirit
[14:22] caught him away
[14:24] over to the ethiopian and he preached
[14:26] the gospel
[14:28] that was the first teleportation person
[14:30] that ever happened
[14:32] and the holy spirit did it because there
[14:34] was a need for it right there
[14:36] and there was a question that the the
[14:38] ethiopian he had a question
[14:40] on his heart and and when he received
[14:43] the holy ghost
[14:44] god used him to take that message to his
[14:46] people
[14:48] so god will make a way whether
[14:50] technology is this is or not
[14:52] and but we try to utilize these things
[14:55] and
[14:55] and to help other people
[14:59] currently we have since 2012
[15:02] to current date we have 1026
[15:07] videos online for people to archive and
[15:10] watch
[15:11] and and view the services and the
[15:13] sermons
[15:14] um since then there's 300 772
[15:19] minutes which equals 5 000 hours have
[15:22] been
[15:22] watched of the sermons that have been
[15:25] going on here that is
[15:27] 5 000 continuous hours that others have
[15:30] watched
[15:31] uh that's 28 000 views and that's just
[15:33] for the videos
[15:35] alone okay so 28 000 plus
[15:39] people have viewed the sermons and the
[15:42] services
[15:42] that have been going on here and you
[15:45] know i
[15:45] encourage even my own children i say do
[15:48] something for the lord
[15:49] if it's to sing a song if it's to clap
[15:51] your hands give a testimony
[15:53] because the people here are not the only
[15:56] ones that
[15:56] are watching you it is around the world
[15:59] now and people benefit from that they
[16:01] edify from that it's an encouragement
[16:03] from that
[16:06] from the website um just just
[16:09] uh of course brother dale he said and i
[16:12] haven't
[16:12] pulled these numbers for a while usually
[16:15] around december
[16:16] or the uh watch not service i'll give
[16:19] you like an overview but last year i
[16:20] didn't
[16:21] um when i pulled up some of the the
[16:23] statistics and things
[16:25] from 2011 to current now we've had 191
[16:29] countries have accessed the website
[16:32] and been able to you know read something
[16:35] and
[16:36] maybe the lord spoke to him what i like
[16:39] here
[16:39] is is things like this email here you
[16:42] know because you you want to know that
[16:43] what you're doing is not in vain that
[16:45] the lord is
[16:46] is helping somebody else um and
[16:48] periodically we get
[16:50] emails back from people and i'm just
[16:53] this is one of many this is a brother in
[16:56] the philippines
[16:58] he said since i personally found your
[17:00] sight
[17:01] i studied prayerfully and that's the god
[17:03] to reveal to us the truth
[17:06] i encountered personal teachings of
[17:08] ministers in the message that declared
[17:10] jesus
[17:10] is not god but a son of god but the
[17:13] truth opened to us when we heard the
[17:15] sermons
[17:16] of brother dale especially on the
[17:17] godhead and also how you emphasize so
[17:20] much on the son of man ministry in the
[17:22] godhead we were enlightened
[17:24] to hear we were enlightened so much that
[17:27] god opened
[17:28] our understanding from that time we
[17:30] handled the message here
[17:32] in this country in the philippines
[17:34] actually but we failed to find a church
[17:37] that strictly
[17:38] taught what the message was teaching see
[17:40] they received a revelation
[17:43] you know they received something they
[17:44] can put their faith in saying i
[17:46] understand this
[17:48] now and god can use anyone that's why
[17:52] you know i believe as the book of acts
[17:55] the holy spirit is a witness in your
[17:57] life never think that you should just
[18:00] let somebody else do something for the
[18:02] lord if he speaks to you
[18:04] go talk to a person plant a seed in
[18:06] their life it can be quick in one day
[18:07] and you don't know where
[18:09] um that can come to fruit fruition
[18:12] so he goes on to say that he appreciates
[18:15] that the work that we're doing over here
[18:19] and it takes your prayers it takes us as
[18:22] a body of believers to pray one for
[18:24] another
[18:24] because this wouldn't be possible if it
[18:27] wasn't for the prayers of the believer
[18:29] so those are some of the things that
[18:32] really makes my heart rejoice because
[18:35] you know we can
[18:36] we can do a lot of work but if the lord
[18:39] isn't in it
[18:40] you know uh he should be the builder
[18:42] he's the one that knows
[18:44] where his sheep are and what they need
[18:47] to take a body change so i appreciate
[18:50] your prayers
[18:51] and you know anytime anybody wants to
[18:54] come back there
[18:55] i'll be glad to just walk anybody
[18:57] through our whole operation we have an
[18:59] open door
[19:01] and to share with you you know if you
[19:03] want to
[19:04] come back there and run the cameras i'm
[19:05] trying to teach jonas right now
[19:07] how to run the cameras feel free you
[19:09] know but you know it's
[19:11] it's through your prayers but it's
[19:13] through what the lord is doing through
[19:14] the ministry here the fifo ministry
[19:17] and we just give god the honor and
[19:22] praise
[19:26] we really really appreciate
[19:34] i can't even turn i get static zelda
[19:37] setting gold on the radio man i
[19:39] i can't do any of that though better get
[19:41] some sound on it
[19:43] see there i can't even keep the sound
[19:44] running correctly
[19:46] but uh we appreciate these brothers and
[19:48] i want to give them a good hand
[19:50] appreciate them and
[19:53] you know the ones that put it out there
[19:56] and do it because that's
[19:58] it's a wonderful thing and uh you know
[20:02] but i just you know i was thinking the
[20:06] other night
[20:07] that i know what brother around said
[20:10] paul's
[20:10] reached a known world of his day i agree
[20:13] there but now it's a whole lot bigger
[20:14] world a whole lot different thing
[20:16] and that's why i read the scripture
[20:18] where jesus said you know
[20:20] the gospel would be preached all the
[20:21] world and then the end would come
[20:23] well that's one of the things that you
[20:26] say well
[20:27] you know how can you reach all of the
[20:29] world you're not reaching every person
[20:31] paul never touched every person that was
[20:34] in the world
[20:35] it was the opportunity just given in the
[20:38] country
[20:39] and the things of places where he was at
[20:41] because everybody wasn't going to listen
[20:42] to him
[20:43] all right but see we don't expect to
[20:45] reach every person in the world
[20:47] but what about just from here alone now
[20:49] what if all the other ministry
[20:51] you know undoing and doing their job and
[20:54] and putting out the things and going and
[20:56] preaching and all
[20:58] and at least our contact has been at
[21:00] least with 191
[21:02] countries and that's wonderful that's
[21:04] that's not bragging that's just truth
[21:07] it wouldn't set out to be bragged about
[21:09] and and everything else it was set out
[21:11] to just
[21:12] contact people that god would allow them
[21:15] to listen
[21:16] and i make it plain and blunt i
[21:19] do not answer questions i've even had
[21:23] ministers say
[21:25] i am a minister and i request for you to
[21:29] answer my question
[21:31] i say i will not answer your question
[21:34] because that would make me some form of
[21:36] a internet ministry and i'm not going to
[21:39] do it
[21:40] but i said i will tell you that on
[21:43] certain certain dates i preached a
[21:44] series on that
[21:46] question that you have if you want to go
[21:48] to that
[21:50] that's your choice but other than that
[21:53] you know and who's going to go listen
[21:54] to you know you tell somebody that i've
[21:57] done preach
[21:58] 35 this is 35 the 35th sermon
[22:02] on the glory of his person most people
[22:05] are not going to listen to 35 sermons
[22:07] i got enough sense to know that and all
[22:10] but that it is offered
[22:11] you know they can do what they want to
[22:13] let's stand let's read our scripture
[22:15] get into our point and for the day and
[22:18] we
[22:19] appreciate all the things okay heavenly
[22:21] father we thank you for your loving your
[22:23] grace thank you for these brothers and
[22:25] sisters here lord
[22:26] that have a burden in their heart for
[22:28] others that they'd give their time
[22:30] their money their their talents their
[22:33] things
[22:34] and lord to see how that you would put
[22:35] them into these places
[22:38] you'd give them jobs way down the road
[22:40] there
[22:41] then bring them together until we have
[22:43] just a wonderful
[22:44] group of people and people are so amazed
[22:47] at the little
[22:48] website things that are put together
[22:50] from this little old hundred people here
[22:52] in the little city of lula georgia
[22:55] and father we're not trying to be
[22:57] anything but what you want us to be
[22:59] but if that's your way of reaching
[23:00] someone then all right then that's it
[23:03] maybe they're in a country that can't be
[23:07] somebody couldn't go to and talk to him
[23:09] but that they they got an opportunity
[23:11] to hear the gospel and we thank you we
[23:13] love you
[23:14] and we just committed all to you in
[23:16] jesus name
[23:17] amen revelations
[23:21] 1
[23:25] i turned to see the voice that spake
[23:27] with me and being turned i saw seven
[23:29] golden candlesticks
[23:31] and in the midst of the seven
[23:32] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[23:34] man
[23:34] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[23:36] and gert about to pouch with a golden
[23:38] girdle
[23:39] his head and his hairs were white like
[23:41] wool
[23:42] as white as snow in his eyes where's the
[23:44] flame of fire
[23:47] and his feet like undefined bryce as if
[23:50] they
[23:50] burned in a furnace and his voice
[23:54] as the sound of many waters now let's go
[23:57] to acts 10
[24:02] now this you'll notice immediately is at
[24:05] the
[24:05] house of canadians in the opening of the
[24:08] door
[24:08] to the gentiles all right and bringing
[24:11] it forward so we just pick apart and
[24:13] start with it
[24:15] and saying showing then verse 38
[24:18] how how god anointed jesus of nazareth
[24:22] with the holy ghost and with power
[24:24] we went about doing good and healing all
[24:26] that were oppressed of the devil
[24:28] for god was with him and we are
[24:31] witnesses of all things which he did
[24:33] both in the land
[24:35] of the jews and in jerusalem whom they
[24:38] slew
[24:38] and hanged on a tree him god raised now
[24:41] he's laying it down right
[24:43] peter is the the thing of what had
[24:47] happened what he had personally
[24:50] witnessed all right and he's telling
[24:53] this to the gentiles
[24:55] him god raised up the third day and
[24:57] showed him openly
[24:58] not to all the people but unto witnesses
[25:01] chosen before of god
[25:03] even to us who did eat and drink with
[25:05] him after he rose from the dead
[25:07] and he commanded us to preach unto the
[25:09] people and he testified it
[25:11] it is he which was ordained of god to be
[25:15] the judge of quick and dead
[25:18] to him gave all the prophets witness
[25:21] that through his name whosoever
[25:23] believeth in him
[25:24] shall receive remission of sins while
[25:28] peter yet spake
[25:29] these words the holy ghost philip on all
[25:31] of them
[25:33] which heard the word and they
[25:36] of the circumcision which believed were
[25:38] astonished
[25:39] as many as came with peter because that
[25:42] on the gentiles
[25:43] also was poured out the gift of the holy
[25:46] ghost you may be seated the lord at his
[25:48] blessing
[25:49] to the reading of the word now
[25:53] to get quickly into our point and
[25:57] you know to get
[26:00] our understanding of what we're trying
[26:02] to do
[26:04] and we've been talking now for quite a
[26:06] while about the new birth
[26:08] and last sunday we covered you know uh
[26:12] what do you call the new birth
[26:15] and uh then we went on in the afternoon
[26:19] to bring the message
[26:20] of how that we are sealed by the holy
[26:23] spirit of promise
[26:24] all right then in seeing that
[26:27] we know that new birth is not
[26:31] what we've all done and we all you ask
[26:33] somebody you walk up to somebody
[26:35] something
[26:36] and you mention the new birth i shouted
[26:37] i spoke in tongues i cried i'd like i've
[26:39] done this
[26:40] they automatically will tell you the
[26:42] things they've done
[26:45] but that is not the birth that's the
[26:49] after effects
[26:50] right the baby
[26:54] gets here and then cries
[26:58] right that's the after effects
[27:02] and you say well but you asked me about
[27:04] my new birth well why did i ask you
[27:05] about your new birth
[27:09] have you been born again all right
[27:12] i didn't ask if you shouted spoke in
[27:14] tongues cried or
[27:16] whatever you done that doesn't have
[27:18] anything to do with the new birth
[27:20] that's what happens after you receive
[27:22] the new birth
[27:23] you understand me all right see they
[27:26] believed for three and a half years and
[27:28] followed the lord jesus
[27:30] but there come a day that in the upper
[27:32] room that the holy ghost came
[27:34] then they had a new birth yet there were
[27:37] great believers they had seen the dead
[27:39] rays the sick healed
[27:40] as a matter of fact they had a part of
[27:41] the ministry they'd done a lot of those
[27:44] things
[27:45] you know you know but yet still they
[27:48] were not born again
[27:50] all right see that's the point i've been
[27:52] driving at for a long time
[27:54] how do you know you're born well i cried
[27:55] i should have spoken to
[27:58] i didn't ask you that how do you know
[28:02] when satan can impersonate everything
[28:06] you can name
[28:08] and that's why you have the people that
[28:10] are so up and down
[28:12] because one time they're shouting and
[28:14] feeling good and the next week
[28:15] everything's going the other way
[28:17] well they don't know what to hold on to
[28:20] all right see the new birth then is the
[28:23] birth we know
[28:24] is what one thing right every natural
[28:28] baby now i said natural normal
[28:30] child that is born in the natural
[28:34] is born the same way right water blood
[28:38] life all right wasn't that what jesus
[28:40] says we've tried to emphasize so much
[28:42] when he said to nicodemus you must be
[28:44] born again look at him say you mean i've
[28:46] got to go back to my mother's womb and
[28:47] come again
[28:48] he said if i talk to you of those things
[28:50] like that and you don't understand
[28:52] there's really no need he said to me to
[28:53] talk to you about heavenly things
[28:56] huh and see he said in other words
[28:58] you're a teacher you're to know these
[28:59] things
[29:00] well surely nicodemus knew the messiah
[29:03] was to come
[29:05] some of the things the messiah was to do
[29:08] why because he was the teacher of israel
[29:10] the greatest of all
[29:12] all right but yet he couldn't understand
[29:14] so we say well
[29:15] poor nicodemus jesus said you must be
[29:18] well all i do is believe
[29:22] well like i emphasize nicodemus put his
[29:24] job on the line because there wasn't
[29:26] very few people in that day
[29:27] jesus wasn't a popular guy to be hung
[29:29] around with
[29:31] right and so he put everything on he
[29:33] went to jesus
[29:34] and he recognized him and he said we
[29:37] know that thou
[29:38] art a man come from god because
[29:41] you couldn't do these things that you're
[29:43] doing
[29:46] but when he spoke to him about the new
[29:47] birth he said i don't understand you
[29:49] why because nobody had spoke of that
[29:53] but every natural baby is born the same
[29:55] way
[29:57] all right so then every person now i
[30:00] want to emphasize it i got it wrote down
[30:02] mark good explain this you know every
[30:05] person that has ever
[30:06] received the new birth received it
[30:08] identically the same
[30:12] now that does away with your shout and
[30:14] you're crying you're doing
[30:15] these things right now you tell me it's
[30:19] some other way i'm open
[30:22] sisters kids come on get up tell us some
[30:25] other way
[30:26] to receive the holy ghost other than the
[30:28] way that every person has always
[30:30] received the holy ghost
[30:33] so you go back to the natural then
[30:34] you're saying well some babies are born
[30:36] this way and somebody
[30:37] now you know better now now we're old
[30:38] enough forget it
[30:40] you're supposed to have a little common
[30:41] sense you know the babies are all born
[30:44] to sign
[30:45] water blood life maybe circumcisions
[30:49] that's not a normal verb
[30:51] i didn't explain that but even in the
[30:54] circumcision you're going to get
[30:56] water blood and life right
[30:59] a big mess all right but see think about
[31:03] it
[31:05] then every person
[31:08] that has ever received the new birth
[31:12] received it the same way
[31:18] all right now here's the statement from
[31:20] the prophet he said like this
[31:21] he said if you say i receive the new
[31:24] birth
[31:24] speaking in tongues he says you are out
[31:27] of the scripture
[31:30] now what about that statement you know
[31:33] why
[31:34] because they received the new birth
[31:37] right come on read the book of acts
[31:41] and then it was a time lapse that they
[31:44] went downstairs
[31:46] and everybody heard them speaking in
[31:48] tongues
[31:50] which was languages right not just
[31:53] blabbering
[31:56] tighter i see see to my tie you know
[32:00] i'm not making no light i'm making light
[32:01] of the people that use that thing as a
[32:03] light
[32:04] you know it's just mockery
[32:08] but listen everybody received the new
[32:11] birth
[32:12] well like can you say your new birth is
[32:13] the same identical new birth
[32:15] that paul received
[32:20] he had a pretty good experience didn't
[32:21] he
[32:23] knocked down on the road to damascus
[32:25] great bright shining light
[32:28] right a whole lot of things
[32:32] but was that his new birth
[32:39] have you ever had an experience
[32:42] of the new birth
[32:47] all right now if we believe it to be
[32:50] correct
[32:52] that everybody that ever received the
[32:54] new birth
[32:55] received the same new birth
[32:59] then everybody would have the same
[33:02] evidence
[33:04] i didn't say experiences of sensations
[33:08] you go through
[33:10] no because everybody's different it's
[33:11] according to your nature your makeup
[33:13] you're doing some christ some shout some
[33:16] just sit there some
[33:17] rejoice some all kind of just different
[33:19] things
[33:20] all right that's that's human nature
[33:24] we all have different human natures
[33:26] about us some are emotional some are not
[33:29] emotional
[33:32] well see are you going to tell the
[33:33] person that's not that's where you
[33:34] troubled that see
[33:36] you ain't never spoke in tongues well
[33:37] you don't have it
[33:41] well the other guy on the other side
[33:42] said you ever did you cry when you spoke
[33:44] in tough
[33:44] no i didn't cry i spoke well you ain't
[33:46] got it
[33:48] because you got to cry
[33:53] huh i had an amazing thing to happen one
[33:56] time when i was preaching
[33:57] i won't call the name of the place or
[33:59] nowhere but i was just preaching away
[34:01] and all at once everybody in the church
[34:03] started crying
[34:11] what's going on you know anyway
[34:14] everybody in the church was just weeping
[34:18] and i'm thought
[34:22] i got over it and finished the message
[34:24] so afterward i asked the pastor
[34:27] i said what did i do wrong you know
[34:30] did i crack a joke did i do something
[34:33] that made everybody
[34:34] start crying he said no brother dale
[34:38] we believe that when the anointing comes
[34:42] it comes with a crying effect upon you
[34:46] and said you touched everybody and we
[34:49] was crying
[34:50] okay but see that was an emotional
[34:53] situation
[34:55] triggered by what you think all right
[35:00] but what is your evidence
[35:05] now remember if the new birth is the new
[35:08] birth
[35:09] of the word that you have heard
[35:12] because the natural baby is born what
[35:16] by the implanting of the seed right
[35:20] and then that triggers the egg and the
[35:24] things happens all right
[35:26] so then all new births
[35:29] would be the word planted into the heart
[35:32] of the individual
[35:34] and then because that would be the
[35:36] scripture faith cometh by hearing
[35:38] and hearing by the word all right then
[35:40] the holy ghost would quicken that word
[35:43] that you've heard
[35:44] and there's your new birth now you
[35:48] explain it to me how it would be
[35:49] something different in every other age
[35:50] or every other time or whatever
[35:52] right
[35:55] you say yeah but so-and-so taught us
[35:57] this way so-and-so taught it
[36:01] come on is the word right
[36:04] you're not arguing with what everybody
[36:06] that's their their doings
[36:08] there was a day and a time that we
[36:11] believed that
[36:12] you know there was three gods
[36:16] until we heard the truth well god didn't
[36:19] hold that against us because
[36:20] until we heard the truth we used to
[36:23] think hell was eternal
[36:24] cold man that old preacher you're going
[36:26] to burn in hell eternally
[36:28] well he's trying his best to scare me
[36:29] today right
[36:33] and you know yourself most of us come to
[36:35] the altar over the fact that we didn't
[36:37] want to go to hell
[36:39] was that right you wanted to be saved
[36:44] but what is what are you going to put
[36:45] the new birth as being
[36:48] all right so we established it as the
[36:50] new birth as being the birth of the word
[36:55] show me in the bible anybody that ever
[36:57] received the holy ghost without hearing
[36:59] the word first
[37:00] show me any word didn't anybody ever
[37:03] receive the holy ghost
[37:05] without hearing the word first even
[37:08] anointed ones
[37:09] hear the word
[37:13] right see then what are we going to do
[37:17] so then all right then everybody that
[37:19] would have the new
[37:20] everybody would have the same evidence
[37:27] now come on that's hard for you to think
[37:29] about
[37:31] would you tell me any other way
[37:40] you you got the opportunity explain to
[37:42] me any other way
[37:44] that if everybody's got the same new
[37:45] birth
[37:47] then everybody's got to have the same
[37:49] evidence
[37:52] all right now what is your evidence
[37:56] i spoke in tongues i cried now we done
[37:59] got away from that part
[38:01] i hope in our thinking that
[38:04] those are attributes
[38:08] you know those are the things the baby
[38:12] does when the baby comes forth from the
[38:14] womb to the mother
[38:16] it cries all right
[38:20] we see it's not the birth
[38:24] all right see
[38:27] evidence then of every age
[38:31] has to be the same
[38:35] or what have you got
[38:39] yeah well brother dale i always thought
[38:40] luther believed he believed just she'll
[38:42] live by faith that's what he blamed
[38:46] which we believe sanctification that's
[38:48] what he believed but it was all the
[38:50] birth of the word
[38:53] there's never been a baby born in the
[38:54] spiritual realm
[38:56] that wasn't born by the birth of the
[38:58] word
[39:06] brother dale you just take away
[39:07] everything that i got that i've held on
[39:09] to all my life
[39:10] well what if what you held on to all
[39:12] your life was wrong
[39:15] i held on until i heard this message
[39:18] that there was three gods what did you
[39:19] hold on to
[39:24] i taught it cured a baptist bible what
[39:28] did you do
[39:32] come on wake up
[39:38] see because i'm talking about a personal
[39:41] experience
[39:44] that's the title of the message now a
[39:47] personal
[39:48] experience
[39:51] how many of you are here today old
[39:54] enough to drive and old enough to be
[39:55] here by your own do it
[39:57] but you're here because mom and daddy
[39:58] came or mom and brother and sister came
[40:03] let's read i chose to read that there in
[40:05] the book of acts
[40:06] they see the holy ghost that fell on the
[40:09] death of pentecost
[40:10] was wonderful but this was bringing it
[40:12] over to the gentile dispensation
[40:15] all right now would you like the
[40:16] scripture where that one of them says
[40:19] can you forbid water these be baptized
[40:22] sin they receive the holy ghost
[40:25] like we did at the beginning
[40:30] because everybody that ever got the new
[40:32] birth
[40:34] it was the same new birth
[40:38] yeah but you don't understand brother
[40:40] dale my baby was different
[40:45] i get in trouble with that i know all
[40:47] the time
[40:48] that's all right i tell the truth you're
[40:51] the one's got to deal with it
[40:53] i love them babies and you know that i
[40:55] love these kids here and you know that
[40:57] so you know i'm not throwing off when i
[40:59] say that you look down at that little
[41:00] baby
[41:01] and you look at him and try to find a
[41:02] halo that's being held up by the horns
[41:04] on his head
[41:06] because all babies are the same but my
[41:09] baby won't do that you
[41:10] are the worst deceived person that's
[41:13] ever been in the world
[41:17] that's why brother dale don't he don't
[41:19] get along with too many people i guess
[41:22] but is it the truth but my baby don't
[41:26] lie
[41:29] but they've got you deceived
[41:34] got cookie all over them the cookie in
[41:36] the hand hiding behind them you know
[41:37] what brother hansel's used to say
[41:39] and there they stand in there you know
[41:41] you ate that quick nope
[41:42] ain't no clue
[41:48] because according to the bible we're all
[41:50] born in sin shape of an iniquity
[41:52] spouse from mother's womb go forth a
[41:53] liar that's according to the bible
[41:55] all right you know what i'm going to
[41:57] believe that
[41:59] i mean you can tell me all about your
[42:01] kids my kids was lying and everything in
[42:03] the book
[42:04] i've always told you that i don't pick
[42:07] on nobody
[42:09] i just tell it like it is
[42:12] you know that little kid look at you boy
[42:14] them little crocodile tears
[42:22] wade one time was giving him a little
[42:23] spanking and with a hickory
[42:26] and boy yeah i wonder i'll ever give him
[42:29] yeah
[42:31] he's about 12 13 years old maybe 12 and
[42:34] i was spanking him a little bit about
[42:36] something he done and
[42:37] i seen immediately what happened
[42:40] and i tapped him and he just voiced
[42:47] i tapped him again here
[42:52] okay time we get something solved
[42:57] either lay the hickory down and forget
[43:00] it
[43:01] or do something else so i applied just a
[43:03] little bit more pressure
[43:05] well that third liquid a little more
[43:07] pressure went from a to it
[43:10] okay we're getting it going now and i'll
[43:13] give him one more and it went man
[43:16] i quit i'm not with him no more
[43:22] ah come on
[43:25] that's what i tell you folks we're so
[43:27] bad on picking on these four kids in
[43:29] this last days
[43:30] about their ways of doing and we came up
[43:32] with our ducktale haircuts
[43:35] and our bell-bottom pants
[43:38] and little bitty belts that we had the
[43:40] little white ones you remember that
[43:42] mine and i was so little i had to put
[43:44] both hooks in the same hole
[43:46] you know you wouldn't believe that now
[43:49] 155 pounds but think about it
[43:53] now listen if all births are the same
[43:57] all evidences would have to be the same
[44:01] all right so we're not talking about who
[44:04] cried who spoke in tongues who shouted
[44:06] who done what
[44:07] and then that way we can't condemn the
[44:09] other person and say
[44:11] well you've never come the way i come
[44:18] now don't tell me you hadn't never
[44:20] looked at anybody
[44:21] else and judged them according to your
[44:23] birth now don't tell me that i'm too old
[44:25] i don't care how old you are
[44:28] my brother dale i don't i don't look at
[44:30] nobody
[44:34] are you still alive
[44:37] yeah were you still looking
[44:41] and problems but see
[44:44] all evidences would have to be the same
[44:50] right so whatever was the evidence for
[44:53] peter
[44:54] paul james john all
[44:59] would be the same evidence that
[45:02] everybody in the
[45:03] times would have and that brother
[45:06] branham would have to have
[45:09] and that you and i have to have
[45:14] and what is that evidence
[45:22] well i cried and see
[45:26] now remember that's what you do
[45:30] afterwards
[45:32] that's what you do after the baby gets
[45:34] here it cries
[45:38] that's not the birth of the baby
[45:41] that's why i wrote around and said
[45:42] there's not too many new births
[45:46] because why because people will go in
[45:48] and they become religious
[45:50] they go to church they want to do good
[45:53] and all that's wonderful but yet they've
[45:55] always got that little
[45:58] up and down right
[46:03] when the service is going good and
[46:06] you know preaching real good you just
[46:09] said happy
[46:11] and then when i get there you you know
[46:15] and you just lock her down and you know
[46:20] but i thought the truth was supposed to
[46:22] set us free
[46:23] i didn't know it was the clapping of the
[46:26] hands and emotions
[46:27] and nobody in this building agrees with
[46:29] emotion as much as this man does
[46:31] i said as much i don't care what you
[46:33] think
[46:34] i've seen god i've smelt god i don't
[46:36] have no arguments with you about
[46:38] anything
[46:39] i'm not going to argue because it can't
[46:41] be done
[46:42] you're not upset on my experience
[46:46] that's in my life that was not my birth
[46:50] and i saw god when i was 11 years old in
[46:52] a church that was not my new birth
[46:57] 99.99 people would say that was their
[47:00] new birth
[47:00] but this is one man that says no
[47:04] when i came in this message and heard
[47:05] brother branham you know what i've told
[47:07] you 40
[47:07] 000 times i immediately seen i didn't
[47:11] have what he's talking about
[47:14] yet i've had all of the other things and
[47:17] great experiences it happened
[47:23] but yet i never had to do birth
[47:26] why because this man is the one that
[47:28] taught me what i'm talking about
[47:30] the new birth is the birth of the word
[47:34] how can you have the birth if you've
[47:35] never heard the word
[47:37] how can you have a birth we're part word
[47:43] you know god had to overlook our
[47:44] ignorances right
[47:46] when we were trinitarians and things
[47:48] that would come through it and give the
[47:50] new birth he had to overlook those
[47:51] things
[47:52] but he comes to a time he said all men
[47:53] must repent
[47:56] it's settled all right
[47:59] so that's why i don't have any trouble
[48:01] with it all right
[48:04] look what the prophet has to say
[48:10] let's go ahead and pick up number one
[48:16] here's something i want to read to you
[48:18] though while you're looking at that
[48:21] i remember about 1970 somewhere right in
[48:24] there
[48:25] some people told me one day said brother
[48:28] branham said we're gonna have to
[48:29] overcome
[48:30] riches and soft living
[48:34] you know i've looked for that quote
[48:37] since 1970
[48:39] because you know what 1970 as i told
[48:43] them last night at the fellowship
[48:44] meeting
[48:46] about 1970 you get 100 people together
[48:49] and you go out in the parking lot and
[48:51] you tallied up how many cars was out
[48:53] there and how much that's worth
[48:55] and you might have had a 30 000 parking
[48:58] lot
[48:58] sitting there right because nobody knows
[49:02] nothing worth nothing
[49:04] tied together with hay bale and wire and
[49:06] all kind of things well they said
[49:08] brother branham said that
[49:09] i said well i just don't see how they
[49:11] were going to have to overcome
[49:13] riches and soft living you know
[49:17] but last night i told him i said you
[49:19] tattly up cause wade had brought it up
[49:22] we were talking about it the you tally
[49:23] up what was that in that parking lot of
[49:25] those new cars that was sitting there i
[49:27] said there's probably close to a million
[49:29] dollars
[49:30] in new cars sitting right out there
[49:34] so brother ram was right we're going to
[49:36] have to overcome soft living in riches
[49:38] but i'm not rich you're a whole lot
[49:41] richer than 90
[49:42] of the world i don't care how poor you
[49:45] think you are
[49:46] you've never been to some of these
[49:48] countries and looked at people that
[49:50] didn't have no food to eat
[49:54] and the first time i went i had three
[49:57] pieces of luggage
[50:00] when i left i came back with three empty
[50:02] luggages
[50:04] i gave away everything i had well i said
[50:07] you mean you
[50:07] gave away your underclothes i said
[50:10] somebody can wear them
[50:12] they can wash them i give them
[50:14] everything away
[50:16] why because i'd seen poverty when my
[50:19] mind when i reached
[50:21] the jamaica in 1991 93
[50:24] my mind rolled back to 1950 when we were
[50:28] poor and
[50:29] the things but look what he says
[50:32] because this is taking off at 239 of the
[50:35] titan church age
[50:36] i don't know where they've got yeah okay
[50:38] no they ain't got that that's the other
[50:40] quote leave it up there cause we'll get
[50:41] to it watch what he said
[50:43] each age had its pressures
[50:46] for example a great burden of this last
[50:49] age
[50:51] is the pressure of riches
[50:54] soft living and nervous tensions
[50:59] in a complex age that we seem
[51:03] unfitted to live in
[51:08] he said well i'm not rich brother dale
[51:11] you're rich according to a lot of the
[51:13] world's standards
[51:15] and you ought to thank god for it you
[51:18] ought to thank him every day for what he
[51:20] give you
[51:20] i thank him every day for my home i
[51:23] thank him every day for my
[51:25] the jobs that i had the living i made
[51:29] i thank him every day for everything i
[51:31] got
[51:34] because he gave it to me what about you
[51:38] all right well listen
[51:42] what is the evidence brother branham of
[51:45] the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:49] if it's not going to be you know gifts
[51:52] signs wonders or whatever crying
[51:55] speaking in tongues
[51:57] then what is those things and what can
[51:59] we use as an evidence
[52:02] so watch what he says all right in the
[52:05] smyrnan church age book he says
[52:07] in every age and every age is the age of
[52:10] the holy ghost
[52:11] for the true believer now then don't get
[52:14] into lutheran them and say as some say
[52:16] they didn't have the holy ghost now that
[52:19] is a lie
[52:21] they had the holy ghost or their age and
[52:23] their time
[52:26] they had the new birth or they're not in
[52:28] the body of christ
[52:30] all right so you're leaving them out of
[52:32] the body of christ right
[52:34] no no no no don't do that so watch watch
[52:37] what he says and every age is the age of
[52:39] the holy ghost for the true believer
[52:40] i say in every age the evidence was the
[52:44] same
[52:48] maybe you don't believe me to say the
[52:49] evidence is the same in each age but
[52:51] maybe you'll believe him
[52:53] if you ain't going to believe me in him
[52:54] you sure ain't going to believe nothing
[52:55] else
[52:57] those who had the spirit the teacher
[53:00] heard the word
[53:01] and the spirit in them took the word and
[53:04] taught it
[53:05] revealed it to them and they were of the
[53:08] group that heard the messenger
[53:11] and his message and took it and loved it
[53:16] what is the evidence of the holy ghost
[53:22] look at the next one what is the
[53:24] evidence of the holy ghost
[53:26] which is taken for the pergamon church
[53:28] age
[53:33] just wrote it on up to save time reading
[53:37] and he talks about why did you
[53:38] understand my speech because you cannot
[53:39] hear me words
[53:40] did you notice jesus said that the world
[53:42] could not receive the holy ghost
[53:46] well in this verse 1 this verse i just
[53:50] read
[53:51] neither could they receive the word why
[53:54] because the spirit and the word
[53:56] are one and if you have the holy spirit
[53:59] as the prophets which emphasizing what
[54:03] there's only one holy spirit
[54:05] the word would come to you and you'd
[54:08] receive it
[54:10] so he goes on down and what what is the
[54:13] evidence of receiving it
[54:14] is what i want to note very carefully
[54:17] that jesus did not say that the evidence
[54:19] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[54:21] was speaking in tongues
[54:22] interpreting prophesying shouting
[54:24] dancing he said the evidence would be
[54:26] that you would be in the truth you would
[54:29] be in the word of god for your age
[54:32] evidence has to do with receiving
[54:35] that word now what about a prophet
[54:43] what about a prophet
[54:46] that wouldn't understand the true
[54:47] evidence of the holy ghost
[54:52] that slaps your face don't it because
[54:53] you don't like think like that
[54:56] what about a day when a man would be a
[54:58] prophet on god
[55:00] but yet not understand the true evidence
[55:07] well they just clicked off a lot of the
[55:08] internet just now because that's
[55:10] all those that we go in all those
[55:11] countries doesn't mean everybody's
[55:13] listening
[55:14] that just mean they connected on all
[55:16] right
[55:17] what did he say
[55:21] about it let's see if i can find it
[55:28] what does it have to do with it
[55:31] okay they don't have this one but
[55:35] i'll give you the this
[55:38] is taken from the broken sister and
[55:40] priest in jeffersonville in 1964
[55:43] 7 26 evening today i was talking with a
[55:47] great friend dr
[55:48] lee vale who is present now and he's
[55:51] quite a theologian
[55:52] and so we usually have some have some
[55:55] pretty good discussions on the scripture
[55:57] verse first mark
[55:58] and he asked me one time what i thought
[56:01] about the
[56:02] initial evidence of the holy ghost was
[56:05] it speaking in tongues
[56:08] he said he'd been many years ago i said
[56:10] no
[56:11] can't see that he said neither do i
[56:16] said though i've been taught that
[56:20] he said what would you think
[56:23] would be an evidence i said the most
[56:26] perfect evidence i can think of
[56:29] is love
[56:33] and so we got to talking on that and
[56:36] then i thought
[56:37] so they got it up here now where you can
[56:39] read it then i thought that sounded
[56:41] pretty good so i just held that if a man
[56:44] has got love now watch him
[56:50] right here but one day
[56:53] the lord in a vision straightened me
[56:57] okay now something straightened out
[56:59] means you had a little bit of a slant or
[57:01] something
[57:02] right it was off this tire straightened
[57:05] me out
[57:06] and he said that the evidence of the
[57:08] spirit was those who would receive the
[57:11] word
[57:12] neither love nor speaking in tongues
[57:16] but it's receiving the word
[57:19] receiving the word all right
[57:24] so then every evidence is the same
[57:30] we said we read that on 142 or submarine
[57:33] in church age
[57:35] every evidence is the sign
[57:41] so let's get down to the truth of it
[57:47] if you think you've got a different
[57:48] evidence then
[57:50] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[57:52] with the word now what are you going to
[57:53] put it on
[57:57] well i saw a vision i saw this one what
[58:00] can i
[58:00] what good is that
[58:05] see the evidence has to do with
[58:08] receiving the word
[58:13] now you tell me you're born again but
[58:15] don't agree with the message of the hour
[58:16] now there's something wrong
[58:21] and now listen these notes was last
[58:22] night and yesterday so don't think i'm
[58:24] picking on you if you
[58:26] think well i come here today and brother
[58:27] dale's picking on me so i don't pick on
[58:29] people i pick on spirits yeah
[58:32] but not people all right
[58:37] so then
[58:41] if everybody has the same experience why
[58:44] is there
[58:45] 969 different denominations
[58:49] and each one of them would tell you a
[58:51] different way of saying that they have
[58:53] the new birth
[58:57] now why is about 2 000 in the message
[59:00] of the hour around it would tell you
[59:03] some of those things
[59:07] you know there's a lot of people say
[59:08] well if you don't believe the way i
[59:09] preach then you don't have the holy
[59:10] ghost
[59:15] right that sounds like that same old
[59:18] spirit just moved up into the message
[59:20] doesn't it
[59:20] so we're not picking on nobody out there
[59:24] we're talking about here what is your
[59:26] evidence
[59:28] what do you think about
[59:34] see then how could like the the way
[59:36] they're doing it today when this
[59:38] people follow this message for 50 years
[59:40] and quoting brother branham
[59:42] and then all at once they're just
[59:44] turning against him
[59:46] and then still all claim the hell of the
[59:48] holy ghost
[59:51] you know there can't be a thousand
[59:53] different ways of seeing the new birth
[59:58] well brother dale you think you're the
[1:00:00] only one that's got it i'm the only one
[1:00:02] that i know for sure knows about what
[1:00:03] i'm talking about
[1:00:06] now you want to argue that that's your
[1:00:08] business i didn't denounce anybody as
[1:00:10] being wrong
[1:00:10] i ain't even never said the pope wasn't
[1:00:12] born again that's his business
[1:00:18] all right but have you ever had a
[1:00:21] personal experience
[1:00:23] with jesus christ
[1:00:33] like i said at 11 years old i saw god in
[1:00:35] the church
[1:00:36] that's a pretty good experience
[1:00:42] all right even my buddy next to me he
[1:00:45] said
[1:00:46] you better go to the altar he said god
[1:00:49] dealing with you
[1:00:52] now i hung onto that seat and i wish i
[1:00:54] hadn't
[1:00:56] but from that day on i tried to find
[1:00:59] somebody that could carry me to that
[1:01:03] god that i saw what did you see brother
[1:01:06] daley that's what everybody wants to
[1:01:08] know
[1:01:10] i saw something in my mind's eye view
[1:01:14] whether it came into reality in our
[1:01:17] dimension that's none of my business
[1:01:20] i just saw something that was real
[1:01:24] and you know what i wanted to find that
[1:01:28] and was real
[1:01:32] well when i went on i become a deacon at
[1:01:34] 23 years of age i've done all the things
[1:01:37] and moved on in the lord
[1:01:39] and come into this message
[1:01:43] well i heard a man talking about the god
[1:01:45] that i had
[1:01:46] seen but i still didn't see it right
[1:01:52] and i knew i wasn't seeing what he was
[1:01:54] talking about
[1:01:58] if you say you believe what he's talking
[1:02:00] about why do you have some other idea
[1:02:03] about a new birth
[1:02:10] why would you do that why would you have
[1:02:11] some other idea about a new birth
[1:02:14] if you believe the prophet taught
[1:02:15] against those times
[1:02:21] right now what was really he teaching
[1:02:25] what's the damage of saying tongues is
[1:02:27] the evidence
[1:02:30] the damage is is when you're going to
[1:02:32] tell that you're going to tell the other
[1:02:33] people
[1:02:34] they've got to speak in tongues well
[1:02:35] what if they don't never speak in
[1:02:37] tongues
[1:02:38] like as i told you my wife's speaking to
[1:02:40] my brother-in-law about it
[1:02:41] and he believes that and she said what
[1:02:43] if you don't have a tongue what if you
[1:02:44] can't talk
[1:02:46] will you cut that person out of the holy
[1:02:47] ghost
[1:02:50] that's just a natural point but it
[1:02:53] solves the problem
[1:02:56] me well brother dale you want us to
[1:02:59] believe you
[1:03:00] i've never asked nobody to believe me
[1:03:03] that's beside the point
[1:03:09] i've always asked people to just believe
[1:03:11] the word
[1:03:15] that's why that i stand as i do with the
[1:03:17] prophet's message because i believe
[1:03:19] he brought us the word
[1:03:23] well you don't know i read a lot of
[1:03:24] other things too i'll be i'm glad to
[1:03:26] read other things
[1:03:29] i love to hear people talk of their
[1:03:31] experiences and things
[1:03:33] and i read other things about people's
[1:03:35] experiences
[1:03:36] because see i'm one that believes in a
[1:03:38] personal experience
[1:03:41] when i ask you have you ever had an
[1:03:42] experience of justification
[1:03:48] have you ever had an experience of
[1:03:50] sanctification
[1:03:54] have you ever had an experience of the
[1:03:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:59] well i got it all at one time uh there's
[1:04:01] a quote
[1:04:02] i've got it laid on my desk i should
[1:04:04] have brought it where brother branham
[1:04:06] says very it's in the church age books
[1:04:09] where very few people will believe all
[1:04:12] the way
[1:04:13] unto receiving the holy ghost
[1:04:20] now if he puts it on a long scale
[1:04:24] there's very few that would be that long
[1:04:26] but if he puts it down on a scale of
[1:04:28] right then then your amount that would
[1:04:31] be dropped from there would drop greater
[1:04:33] here
[1:04:33] as to somebody saying i got it at one
[1:04:36] time
[1:04:37] now he never said you didn't and i won't
[1:04:40] say you didn't
[1:04:45] that's between you and god don't ask me
[1:04:48] whether you think i
[1:04:50] brother dale i want to know no do you
[1:04:52] think i'm born again i'm not going to
[1:04:54] answer you
[1:04:55] first off if you've got to have my
[1:04:57] opinion of it
[1:04:59] then you're lost that's the best way to
[1:05:02] say it
[1:05:02] if you've got to have my opinion of
[1:05:05] whether or not you're saved or not then
[1:05:07] i'll tell you you're lost
[1:05:08] right because you're trying to put it on
[1:05:11] something i say
[1:05:15] but what about a personal experience
[1:05:22] i didn't know we had to have one well
[1:05:23] what's what's wrong with the
[1:05:25] ministers of the message today how many
[1:05:28] of you
[1:05:28] how many of you have you heard them talk
[1:05:31] about a personal experience
[1:05:37] something that satan cannot take away
[1:05:41] from you
[1:05:45] and something that you won't change
[1:05:47] meeting houses because of
[1:05:49] the way somebody says son
[1:06:00] and brother i all said one time he said
[1:06:03] won't you go up and let brother dale
[1:06:04] talk you out or what you think you got
[1:06:06] because you like talking out of it it
[1:06:08] means you don't have it right
[1:06:10] all right i've never tried to destroy
[1:06:13] anybody's experience because everybody
[1:06:15] has
[1:06:16] different experiences in their life
[1:06:20] but there's never if you're going to
[1:06:21] have one evidence of the holy ghost
[1:06:24] and you're going to have one new birth
[1:06:25] of the word
[1:06:27] and everybody's going to have the same
[1:06:28] then you're going to have to have the
[1:06:29] same experience
[1:06:34] so you see where the trouble would be
[1:06:35] try to make everybody have your
[1:06:36] experience
[1:06:43] it's all right if you got one biblical
[1:06:45] you know what i mean if it's lined up in
[1:06:46] the scripture
[1:06:50] i would like for you to really show me
[1:06:53] where brother branham tells you about
[1:06:54] his experience
[1:06:56] now i can give you all the quotes he
[1:06:57] said in the woodshed
[1:07:00] and running down the railroad track and
[1:07:02] a lot of other things
[1:07:06] but you know i believe you had one don't
[1:07:10] you
[1:07:12] but i mean you get it down to where he
[1:07:14] said i was right here at one certain
[1:07:16] place
[1:07:18] and then you'll hear him explaining i
[1:07:20] was right here at one certain place
[1:07:25] well i still ain't got the whole message
[1:07:27] preached and
[1:07:28] lord willing maybe next sunday we'll get
[1:07:29] on to being born again
[1:07:31] or maybe wednesday whatever i get to the
[1:07:33] point
[1:07:34] because i see i believe that this new
[1:07:37] birth that we receive right here
[1:07:39] that when that headstone comes it's
[1:07:41] going to be a birth of the word
[1:07:43] you know and you you can't start off bad
[1:07:46] you've got to start off right
[1:07:48] and then whatever's coming will come to
[1:07:50] that word
[1:07:51] because if it's not it's not going to
[1:07:52] come that word but now there's shoutings
[1:07:55] in the things i've always told you
[1:07:59] i've always taught this because i'll
[1:08:00] believe it when it comes to the
[1:08:02] anointing being poured out it's promised
[1:08:05] in the bible that the prophet said
[1:08:06] that they'd become an anointing that
[1:08:08] would fill every fiber you're being and
[1:08:10] take in the rapture
[1:08:11] all right you know what i believe that's
[1:08:13] going to fall on the whole
[1:08:15] basic religious systems i've always
[1:08:18] taught that because i've always believed
[1:08:19] it
[1:08:20] so that means the two soul people is
[1:08:22] going to say look
[1:08:24] what we're having is proof that we're
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:29] now what are you going to do but you
[1:08:32] open another door and the seventh
[1:08:33] universe is going to say
[1:08:35] we told you this was coming
[1:08:40] now where are you going
[1:08:45] all right remember
[1:08:48] according to the bible everything in the
[1:08:52] in the world was going to be deceived
[1:08:54] except
[1:08:55] the bride right and may i quote brother
[1:08:59] branham
[1:09:01] he said frankly get her messed up and
[1:09:04] he'd have to cut the work short now you
[1:09:06] need that quote
[1:09:10] oh no brother dale we can't be deceived
[1:09:15] he didn't say you could be deceived and
[1:09:17] lost he just said he'd get it all messed
[1:09:19] up
[1:09:20] i just got through reading a quote here
[1:09:23] that says we were going to have to
[1:09:24] overcome
[1:09:25] soft living and nervous conditions
[1:09:29] to overcome this world
[1:09:32] all right now what do we believe
[1:09:37] have you ever had a personal experience
[1:09:43] i like to hear your experience i wish
[1:09:45] you'd write it down let me read it
[1:09:48] i enjoy reading your experiences and i'm
[1:09:50] not going to say
[1:09:51] well you didn't do that you didn't do
[1:09:53] that you didn't do like i done you
[1:09:54] didn't do like this and done
[1:09:57] you're going to tell me if you tell me
[1:09:58] your experience you're going to tell me
[1:10:00] of some emotional situations
[1:10:02] the different things that is in you of
[1:10:04] crying or discipline
[1:10:06] you're going to tell me that and i'm not
[1:10:08] going to argue with you about it
[1:10:09] i'm just going to ask you about the
[1:10:14] birth
[1:10:17] what about a new birth from according to
[1:10:19] malachi 4.
[1:10:25] you see we've got a lot of things that
[1:10:27] we need to understand
[1:10:29] but what about your personal experience
[1:10:42] what about all of the quotes that i've
[1:10:43] got laying here from the prophet of what
[1:10:45] he said about
[1:10:48] the personal experience
[1:10:55] what kind of experience have you ever
[1:10:58] had
[1:11:01] moses had a personal experience with god
[1:11:10] he met god in a burning bush
[1:11:14] face to face
[1:11:18] he had a great experience
[1:11:23] a personal experience those in the upper
[1:11:26] room were
[1:11:28] wonderful believers
[1:11:32] but one day they had a personal
[1:11:38] experience
[1:11:40] the only way you can know god i'm just
[1:11:42] scanning down reading some of these
[1:11:43] things
[1:11:45] the only way you can know god is to know
[1:11:48] him by personal experience
[1:11:51] if not you're saying what somebody else
[1:11:53] says
[1:11:56] you say what the bible says and that's
[1:11:58] fine but
[1:11:59] is that a personal experience
[1:12:05] what about that one day it's going to be
[1:12:07] required of you what you did about the
[1:12:09] understanding
[1:12:11] of god's word
[1:12:15] your education is fine but the word of
[1:12:18] god is life
[1:12:21] to know the alive word or the quicken of
[1:12:24] the word
[1:12:24] makes you alive you can only know him by
[1:12:29] the word
[1:12:30] for he is the word
[1:12:33] outside of knowing christ by personal
[1:12:35] experience with him
[1:12:39] not joining a church or reciting a creed
[1:12:43] then we only bring it to the shallow
[1:12:45] condition
[1:12:47] did you listen
[1:12:52] outside in other words of knowing christ
[1:12:55] by a personal experience you're going to
[1:12:56] bring it to a shallow condition
[1:13:01] and then you're going to put it on some
[1:13:05] thing that you believe
[1:13:10] that makes you
[1:13:14] be saved
[1:13:17] and what is that
[1:13:25] but what about believing 99 of the word
[1:13:30] and rejecting one word
[1:13:33] can you say that that is the holy ghost
[1:13:36] if it rejects one word
[1:13:37] now we're not folks we're not dumb okay
[1:13:41] i'm not talking about knowing all the
[1:13:43] word
[1:13:44] because that's not according to
[1:13:46] everybody everybody don't know all of
[1:13:48] the word
[1:13:49] and i don't know all the word and you
[1:13:50] don't know all the word we don't worry
[1:13:52] about it
[1:13:54] right
[1:13:58] well what's your experience
[1:14:01] have you had a personal experience with
[1:14:03] jesus christ
[1:14:09] now let me get a hold of this you don't
[1:14:12] think i'm wrong that's all right
[1:14:13] i'll say it like i mean it you go to
[1:14:16] these
[1:14:17] take these kids to these youth camps and
[1:14:19] things
[1:14:20] and i'm not against that folks now you
[1:14:23] better get it right because you say
[1:14:24] anything different that's between you
[1:14:25] and god
[1:14:26] because i'm warning you i believe in
[1:14:28] doing all you can to try to help
[1:14:30] anybody kids or whatever but why is the
[1:14:34] same kids and altar the same
[1:14:36] time the next year trying to seek after
[1:14:40] god
[1:14:43] now may i quote brother branham do you
[1:14:45] mind that
[1:14:47] he said that's why you don't go down in
[1:14:49] the aisles and try to talk to them
[1:14:51] kids and people or anybody to try to get
[1:14:54] them to come to altar
[1:14:55] why i'm letting the lord too lord told
[1:14:58] me go talk that person
[1:15:04] if it was god
[1:15:07] but what if it's you
[1:15:13] but why are you crying out for god for
[1:15:17] the same thing a year later
[1:15:20] why don't you reach a place somewhere to
[1:15:22] settle it
[1:15:26] well i think you ought to get them there
[1:15:28] to where they can cry well that's good
[1:15:30] but may i quote the prophet he said if
[1:15:32] you do those things to try to get those
[1:15:35] people to the altar
[1:15:38] he said you'll make it harder for them
[1:15:41] to come the next time
[1:15:52] we don't want to hear what the prophet
[1:15:54] has to say right
[1:15:56] because we got our own ideas well just
[1:15:59] remember
[1:16:02] if our ideas is contrary to the word of
[1:16:05] god
[1:16:07] then it doesn't make no difference who
[1:16:08] we are
[1:16:11] it ain't going to be changed because you
[1:16:12] or me
[1:16:14] right god's going to honor his word
[1:16:18] he'll keep his word
[1:16:22] that's why i've always just tried to be
[1:16:23] stable in everything and just go right
[1:16:25] on down the road
[1:16:27] i was talking to brothers i want to go
[1:16:29] about something
[1:16:30] one of these days i'm going to get
[1:16:31] around to preach on healing relation to
[1:16:34] medicine
[1:16:35] i've told you that and i'll get to it
[1:16:36] one of these days
[1:16:40] because what's the difference in you and
[1:16:41] your great super-duper faith
[1:16:44] are going to the doctor and he gives you
[1:16:46] something and it takes away that
[1:16:48] problem your prophet said it i didn't
[1:16:52] god healed through medicine got healed
[1:16:53] by laughter got healed by singing
[1:16:55] god healed by many things
[1:17:00] all right but the worst thing is of fear
[1:17:05] fear hath torment
[1:17:09] you go to the doctor and the doctor says
[1:17:12] you got cancer
[1:17:16] you just draw up why
[1:17:25] why are you going to take the devil's
[1:17:28] interpretation let's cure you to death
[1:17:33] he's only dealing with medical science
[1:17:34] that's all he can do that's right
[1:17:36] right now the reason i can say this do
[1:17:39] you know that i don't have to back up
[1:17:41] from what i say
[1:17:43] because you've been with me when they
[1:17:46] told me i had leukemia i looked at the
[1:17:47] doctor i said so what
[1:17:51] i didn't know that the leukemia that i
[1:17:53] had until
[1:17:54] some weeks or maybe might have been a
[1:17:56] month but i know it was weeks
[1:17:57] from going to one doctor that they
[1:17:59] didn't know what kind it was
[1:18:00] to send me to a cancer doctor and he
[1:18:03] came in and said sam
[1:18:04] i got good news you got leukemia yeah
[1:18:08] but said it's not the kind you die of
[1:18:10] it's the kind you die with we'll just
[1:18:12] keep it under control
[1:18:14] me and him have us a good time talking
[1:18:16] every time i go see him he said i love
[1:18:18] for you to come in
[1:18:23] because he said how you doing the first
[1:18:24] thing i say i said how are you doing
[1:18:26] you're trying that with your doctor
[1:18:27] sometimes right
[1:18:30] you go into the doctor and he says how
[1:18:31] you doing look back and said how you
[1:18:33] doing
[1:18:34] you see an expression on his face that
[1:18:36] you ain't never seen
[1:18:39] because he don't think about that
[1:18:44] but i had no fear
[1:18:48] of whether it was what kind of leukemia
[1:18:51] they still can't prove it because it
[1:18:54] just goes up and down they just laugh at
[1:18:56] me
[1:19:00] brother there was you're scared when you
[1:19:01] laid on that table and they hooked you
[1:19:03] up to that machine and shocked your
[1:19:05] heart
[1:19:05] when there is a chance that you could
[1:19:07] never come back from that situation
[1:19:10] you do sign all that paperwork to let
[1:19:13] them know that it's okay
[1:19:14] if your ticker don't start back ticking
[1:19:17] right that's right well you're scared no
[1:19:21] was laughing
[1:19:27] and no fear
[1:19:31] i stood and seen trees bend over and
[1:19:34] just lay down
[1:19:37] with the wind and stand there with no
[1:19:39] fear
[1:19:41] then i've heard a trickle on the house
[1:19:42] be scared to death so i'm not one of
[1:19:44] these super dupers okay
[1:19:46] i'm just plain human i've had fear to
[1:19:50] come on me and i know what it is
[1:19:51] but when anything they tell you don't
[1:19:53] take what they say it's what the bible
[1:19:55] says
[1:19:58] if you've had a personal experience why
[1:20:00] are you worried about dying
[1:20:05] oh they said to brother branham said you
[1:20:07] are not say these things to these kids
[1:20:09] talking about and people talking about
[1:20:11] the coming of the lord
[1:20:12] something to that degree i may miss it
[1:20:14] to her he said why would you be worried
[1:20:16] about
[1:20:18] your lord coming you know
[1:20:21] you mean you're afraid your lord's
[1:20:23] coming
[1:20:25] you know what you're afraid of because
[1:20:27] you ain't lined up
[1:20:29] you're afraid he's going to bring the
[1:20:30] sin out ain't you afraid of that
[1:20:34] yeah but but brother dale
[1:20:38] why not if you've had a personal
[1:20:42] experience with god
[1:20:45] is there any way to take away can they
[1:20:48] deprogram you
[1:20:55] you know can they take you in and
[1:20:57] deprogram you and make you a trinitarian
[1:21:05] with him dirty thoughts is coming okay
[1:21:11] how come there's so many people jumping
[1:21:13] around in the message from one doctrine
[1:21:14] to another
[1:21:19] i'm sorry dirty
[1:21:22] but that's the way i think
[1:21:26] brother would be had a good point he
[1:21:27] said you get them in with a hot dog you
[1:21:28] can get them out with a hamburger
[1:21:31] that was a point you take one doctor and
[1:21:34] convince somebody they're right and take
[1:21:35] another doctor and convince them they're
[1:21:37] right
[1:21:38] then you don't know where you're
[1:21:40] standing yes but brother dale
[1:21:43] i'm not a preacher i didn't know that
[1:21:46] the bible only said the preacher
[1:21:50] i didn't know brother branham put the
[1:21:52] preacher was to have the evidences
[1:21:56] i believe he's supposed to but i thought
[1:21:58] he said every individual
[1:22:01] that's right i thought he said
[1:22:04] every person was to have a personal
[1:22:07] experience
[1:22:08] with god
[1:22:14] but brother dale i've never i've never
[1:22:16] went through what you're talking about
[1:22:17] justification
[1:22:18] case the baptism went over why not
[1:22:27] and the prophet explained it in simple
[1:22:29] terminology
[1:22:32] justification is when you repented of
[1:22:34] your sins
[1:22:36] and you ask god to forgive you or what
[1:22:38] was in your life
[1:22:40] but that didn't change you'd make you
[1:22:42] did any different that just wiped away
[1:22:43] that sin
[1:22:46] here's your home come on read it
[1:22:47] sanctification
[1:22:49] what driving out that unclean spirit out
[1:22:52] of you
[1:22:55] washing you by the washing of the water
[1:22:57] of the word
[1:22:59] you want to go to church you want to be
[1:23:01] right you want to live right you want to
[1:23:02] do right
[1:23:05] but see there's the danger one because
[1:23:07] you'll stop right there
[1:23:08] saying i must be a christian because i
[1:23:10] don't want to act like i used to
[1:23:15] all right but why is it that
[1:23:19] after a while you fall you slip and you
[1:23:22] slide
[1:23:27] because see if there's something real
[1:23:28] within there
[1:23:32] i've told you before and i mean it with
[1:23:34] the deafness of my heart
[1:23:37] i was born to dale and according to my
[1:23:40] record child i won
[1:23:43] but you know what i might not be a day
[1:23:45] of by natural birth
[1:23:48] but that's what i've been told all of my
[1:23:50] life and that's settled it
[1:23:52] you mean that somebody could come along
[1:23:54] today and give me 10 million dollars
[1:23:56] to get me to change my name there's
[1:23:59] something wrong with you
[1:24:04] well i'd sure change my name for 10
[1:24:06] million
[1:24:12] you understand what i mean when you
[1:24:13] change your name you're doing away with
[1:24:16] the existence of that person
[1:24:17] that you lived all of your life and that
[1:24:20] family that raised you
[1:24:23] if i found out i was adopted i would
[1:24:26] shout glory hallelujah
[1:24:28] i was adopted by the dale family
[1:24:34] and i'm going to stay one
[1:24:38] come on what are you talking about i'm a
[1:24:40] christian by birth
[1:24:47] i've had many experiences
[1:24:50] too unmatched by most people
[1:24:53] that could ever tell about it but i
[1:24:56] don't have to
[1:24:57] worry about it i'll face you at judgment
[1:24:59] by me telling it to you
[1:25:01] it's not something to build me up it's
[1:25:03] something to let you know brother brown
[1:25:05] said some people go through certain
[1:25:06] things to let other people know i've
[1:25:12] seen an angel in my home three times
[1:25:15] would you ever talk to him no don't be
[1:25:17] stupid
[1:25:20] first time i seen it i grabbed a pistol
[1:25:22] and took off after it
[1:25:26] that's how real it was
[1:25:30] that don't make nothing out of me
[1:25:35] because i don't count none of that it's
[1:25:36] my experience
[1:25:40] that day in that altar it was settled
[1:25:46] the pro when brother mo said what the
[1:25:48] prophet had told us
[1:25:50] the new birth is the birth of the word
[1:25:52] brother dale
[1:25:54] the words you've heard
[1:25:57] i said that's it
[1:26:02] well no great shining lights with no
[1:26:04] great things took place
[1:26:06] but i had an experience
[1:26:12] and i honestly i believe your experience
[1:26:14] a lot of times is an ongoing thing
[1:26:19] amen if you're going to believe in being
[1:26:21] born again being born again
[1:26:24] by the end corrupted word then you're
[1:26:26] going to believe that you've got a new
[1:26:27] birth and then you're going to believe
[1:26:28] that you're being born again as you
[1:26:29] heard the word
[1:26:33] come on did we just finish up the other
[1:26:35] day in just a second
[1:26:36] what did the prophet say you can only be
[1:26:39] saved
[1:26:40] by revelation
[1:26:47] i didn't say that
[1:26:53] the new birth is a personal experience
[1:26:55] it's a revelation of jesus christ
[1:26:58] personally to you you know what i was
[1:27:01] sitting there one day and
[1:27:02] i always had to mark it down but
[1:27:05] listening to the prophet and he said you

[1:27:08] he said it's revelation
[1:27:11] how did he know that that lady was
[1:27:14] white-headed and she lived at certain
[1:27:16] certain streets
[1:27:20] something happened within him that was a
[1:27:23] revelation the same way moses
[1:27:25] said what happened in the garden
