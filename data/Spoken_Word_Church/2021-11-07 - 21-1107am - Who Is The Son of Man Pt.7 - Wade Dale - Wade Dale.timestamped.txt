[7:55] amen god bless you we love you with the
[7:57] love of the lord let's go ahead and turn
[7:58] to john 1
[8:00] 1 and we'll continue our thought this
[8:02] will be part 7
[8:04] on who is this son of man
[8:08] because we really
[8:10] we really have not we've got him here on
[8:12] earth but we got to
[8:15] if the son of man is supposed to be the
[8:17] one that we that we characterize
[8:19] ourselves after
[8:21] we need to know what he is
[8:23] what he done why he came
[8:26] and why he's called the son of man
[8:29] not the son of god all right so let's go
[8:31] to john 1
[8:33] 1.
[8:36] just keep all these in prayer we'll
[8:37] announce them again on wednesday and
[8:39] then on sunday so just
[8:41] just don't forget squash casserole next
[8:43] sunday
[8:45] john 1 verse
[8:47] 1 let's bow our heads
[8:49] dear lord thank you for this day that
[8:50] you give us
[8:51] father you truly have given the cream of
[8:54] the crop lord
[8:55] this is your people
[8:57] the greatest people to walk on the face
[8:58] of the earth as we were talking last
[9:00] night we truly are blessed to have the
[9:02] truth
[9:03] not a truth not a part truth not what we
[9:06] think is truth but we have the truth
[9:09] and you are the way the truth and the
[9:10] life so we know that it's also
[9:13] we need to understand who you were while
[9:15] you were down here on earth
[9:17] the son of man
[9:19] lord and we'll see that lord that you
[9:20] were god made flesh
[9:22] and dwelt among us lord forgive us of
[9:25] our sins and our many mistakes lord be
[9:27] with the people that are sick richard
[9:29] roberts are different ones they're not
[9:31] feeling well lord we pray that you'd
[9:32] touch each one in our bodies
[9:34] lord send your healing power lord you
[9:36] said you sent your word and healed the
[9:37] people so may we get a revelation that
[9:39] we're all healed today father any
[9:41] ailment or whatever we have sin sickness
[9:43] or anything else lord we pray that you
[9:45] take care of that lord as we speak the
[9:46] word in your name the lord jesus christ
[9:49] amen
[9:51] in the beginning was the word the word
[9:53] was with god
[9:54] the word was god
[9:56] that's not three people
[9:59] the same was in the beginning with god
[10:02] all things were made by him
[10:05] this person
[10:06] and without him was not anything made
[10:08] that was made
[10:09] in him was life and the life was the
[10:11] light of men
[10:12] and the light shineth in darkness and
[10:14] the darkness comprehended it not
[10:16] there was a man sent from god whose name
[10:19] was john we know that's john the baptist
[10:21] he was to introduce who
[10:23] not the son of god
[10:25] he was to introduce god in human flesh
[10:29] and we see a repeat of that in the end
[10:31] time
[10:33] god sent us a prophet
[10:38] the third coming of elijah
[10:40] was who john the baptist right
[10:44] william branham was the forthcoming of
[10:45] elijah the spirit of elijah and he
[10:48] introduced
[10:50] jesus christ
[10:51] to the world
[10:53] and showing that jesus is back in human
[10:55] flesh again
[10:57] in his people not in a body a corporal
[11:00] body
[11:01] because you can't have two bodies here
[11:02] at the same time on earth we already
[11:03] went through that
[11:04] all right there was a man sent from god
[11:06] whose name was john the same came for a
[11:08] witness to bear witness of the light
[11:10] that all men through him might believe
[11:11] he was not that light all right
[11:14] separated remember he was not the light
[11:16] he wasn't the son of man he was
[11:18] introducing the son of man
[11:20] but was sent to bear witness of that
[11:22] light
[11:23] that was the true light which lighteth
[11:25] every man that cometh into the world
[11:27] he was in the world and the world was
[11:28] made by him and the world knew him not
[11:30] now here we go with that's one
[11:31] characteristic he was in the world the
[11:34] world didn't know who he was all right
[11:37] same way he's going to be with me and
[11:38] you
[11:39] he came into his own and his own
[11:41] received him not
[11:42] he came to the world he came to the
[11:44] denominations he came to whoever you
[11:45] want to say and they turned him down
[11:48] they received him not i'm reading the
[11:50] bible but as many as received him thank
[11:52] god
[11:54] as many as received him
[11:56] to them gave he power to become the sons
[12:00] of god not the son of charles and alla
[12:02] brown i'm not the son of samuel peggy
[12:03] dale not the son of
[12:06] wherever you come from
[12:08] flesh
[12:10] but as many as received him to him gave
[12:12] he power to become the sons of god as he
[12:14] was talking last we were talking last
[12:16] night he told nicodemus he said you've
[12:18] got to have a conversion from that birth
[12:21] to the new birth
[12:22] amen
[12:24] which were born not of blood
[12:27] nor of the will of the flesh
[12:28] nor of the will of man but of god
[12:32] and here we go verse 14. and the word
[12:34] all this
[12:36] all this word was made flesh and dwelt
[12:39] among us and we beheld his glory the
[12:41] glory of the only begotten of the father
[12:43] full of grace and truth you may be
[12:44] seated in the lord added blessing to the
[12:46] reading of word just background just a
[12:48] few minutes
[12:50] we want to go to hebrews 10 verse 1
[12:54] and read
[12:55] for the law having a shadow of good
[12:57] things to come and not the very image of
[12:59] the thing remember everything that
[13:00] happened in the old testament
[13:03] was a shadow or a type of christ coming
[13:07] on earth and having a group of people
[13:10] and you and i it's an it's the example
[13:12] remember the bible says these things in
[13:14] the old testament were given to us for
[13:16] what example
[13:18] to whom the end of the world has come
[13:19] upon well guess what
[13:22] the end of the world has come upon the
[13:23] people
[13:24] and we've got to look at the shadows and
[13:26] the types because it was only a shadow
[13:28] because it was speaking of what jesus
[13:30] christ the true lamb of god not just a
[13:32] regular lamb that they put up on a up on
[13:35] a pedestal and and killed it and burn it
[13:38] and god said okay that's fine but i'm
[13:40] coming myself
[13:42] because watch
[13:44] for the law having a shadow of good
[13:45] things to come and not the very image of
[13:47] the thing
[13:48] can never with those sacrifices which
[13:50] they offered year by year continually
[13:52] make the comer there and do perfect so
[13:54] there was no perfection in the old
[13:55] testament
[13:57] it was only covering or capo it pushed
[14:00] the sins to calvary it wouldn't let you
[14:02] become a christian
[14:06] because you couldn't
[14:08] because you couldn't get born again you
[14:09] couldn't get the holy ghost the holy
[14:11] ghost was tied up in this man named
[14:12] jehovah
[14:14] all right
[14:16] for then would they
[14:18] not have ceased to be offered
[14:20] in other words one time and it's done no
[14:23] they had offered every year because that
[14:25] the worshiper once purged should have
[14:26] had no more conscience
[14:28] of sin
[14:30] but in those sacrifices there is a
[14:32] remembrance again made of sins every
[14:34] year every year
[14:37] at any feast wherever they were supposed
[14:39] to go to
[14:41] feast of atonement they knew everybody
[14:43] had together they knew the priests had
[14:44] to take the blood off of the they had to
[14:47] uh kill the red heifer they had to put a
[14:49] lamb up for so many days they had all
[14:51] these things they had to do
[14:53] showing in type though
[14:55] that jesus christ was coming but they
[14:57] couldn't take away your sin that's right
[14:59] they only covered it
[15:02] okay so now watch what what is paul
[15:04] saying here but in those sacrifices
[15:06] there is a remembrance again made of
[15:08] sins
[15:09] every year
[15:11] for it is not possible that the blood of
[15:12] bulls and of goats should take away sins
[15:14] all right so it can't take it away it
[15:16] only covers it
[15:18] but what's he going to do wherefore
[15:20] when he cometh into the world he says
[15:22] sacrifice and offerings thou is not but
[15:26] a body
[15:29] a human mortal body the word was made
[15:32] flesh
[15:33] but a body has now prepared me
[15:36] they fell in human flesh in the garden
[15:38] of eden god had to come back in human
[15:41] flesh amen
[15:44] to get us out of this
[15:46] and we'll read we'll read it in just a
[15:48] few minutes we'll read a quote that's
[15:49] what god had to do that's what he wanted
[15:52] to do
[15:53] that was his master plan that we've been
[15:55] talking about for 40-something sermons
[15:58] on the eternal plan of redemption that
[16:00] eternal plan of redemption hinged on god
[16:03] not a second person he didn't send
[16:06] somebody that would be awful
[16:10] i did something and i'm gonna send josh
[16:12] to take my place
[16:15] no i gotta go do it myself
[16:17] i need to do as they say in in the world
[16:20] cowboy up
[16:23] they fell
[16:25] in the garden
[16:26] god said i'll put in me enmity between
[16:28] you and the seed of the woman in other
[16:30] words i'm going to come back in literal
[16:32] human flesh
[16:34] to take away the sin of the world so
[16:36] that's what john said and we'll read in
[16:37] just a few minutes he said behold the
[16:39] lamb of god that takes away the sin of
[16:41] the world all right but see you and i
[16:43] we're not we're not looking at a second
[16:45] person of a trinity
[16:47] and we didn't receive the third person
[16:49] of the trinity when we got the new birth
[16:52] we received god
[16:54] or he's not god
[16:56] amen he's either god almighty and human
[16:58] flesh or he's an imposter
[17:00] amen
[17:02] because he said he was coming
[17:04] he said he was going to be here
[17:07] i am going to do this abraham i am
[17:10] talking about abraham's journey last
[17:12] night
[17:13] you know what about a man
[17:15] named abram
[17:18] he's just sitting around in in a little
[17:20] city called ur
[17:22] and he's helping his daddy make idols
[17:25] so they worship many gods
[17:28] right he was an idol maker
[17:31] his daddy was so he obviously had to
[17:33] help his daddy it was a family business
[17:35] but all of a sudden he hears this voice
[17:38] one day
[17:39] and i don't believe it was
[17:41] sound like james earl jones
[17:43] for those of you that don't know who
[17:44] that is he talks real deep you know
[17:46] everybody thinks god talks real deep now
[17:48] the devil talks that way too
[17:53] hello somebody
[17:55] so your god talks to you different than
[17:57] the devil does
[17:59] sometimes you can't tell the difference
[18:01] hello
[18:02] you just got to check it by the word of
[18:04] god
[18:05] you shake it by the word of god and you
[18:07] keep taking it the word of god because
[18:08] satan cannot stand the word of god
[18:11] but now he only added when he came to
[18:13] eve he only added one word
[18:16] he quoted
[18:17] what jesus what god said
[18:19] you eat that you eat of this tree thou
[18:21] shalt surely die
[18:25] all satan said was not
[18:27] thou shalt not
[18:29] surely die he quoted him 99 of the
[18:31] sermon
[18:33] and made one one little one word off
[18:36] threw everything into chaos
[18:38] so that's what that's why that we were
[18:40] saying last night in the bible study
[18:42] that i just believe that
[18:44] that are dumb enough to believe that
[18:46] that god's eternal god's perfect
[18:49] he had to have a perfect people
[18:52] so he could come back into those people
[18:54] in the end time with a perfection of the
[18:56] word of god outside of anything else
[18:59] that anybody else has any other idea or
[19:02] thought
[19:03] he sent the message to me and you
[19:06] amen he sent he god sent the message to
[19:09] me and you yeah now what are you going
[19:10] to do about it right amen you're going
[19:12] to take it and say well it's just it's
[19:14] just it's just part of christianity
[19:18] no
[19:19] come on folks
[19:21] that's not christianity out there
[19:24] they're trying their best they're doing
[19:25] the best they can
[19:27] but they're not living listen like i
[19:29] said last night
[19:31] we're the only people that do things
[19:33] halfway correct even though we are a
[19:35] little bit off and wrong in our humanity
[19:38] we baptize right
[19:42] there's that's the whole thing last
[19:43] night we were talking about listen
[19:45] there's seven billion people in this
[19:46] world let's just say three billion or
[19:48] four billion
[19:50] are christians and not buddhist or hindu
[19:52] or whatever that other is because they
[19:55] don't baptize
[19:56] right but you take all the other
[19:58] christendom roman catholic and just name
[20:00] them all
[20:01] they all have one thing in common they
[20:04] baptized in the name of the father and
[20:06] the son and holy ghost
[20:08] and
[20:09] the bible says the whole world is
[20:12] deceived by that
[20:14] they're deceived by that beast and that
[20:16] beast is what rome
[20:19] and their rome they the whole thing is
[20:21] is father son holy ghost they they deny
[20:24] the baptism in the name of the lord
[20:25] jesus christ
[20:27] everybody does except just a what a
[20:29] small few people
[20:32] thank god we're part of that small few
[20:34] people
[20:35] that's doing it right it's not this it's
[20:37] not that well i do it because brother
[20:38] branham says
[20:40] come on people we got to get out of that
[20:42] i do it because brother brown says no i
[20:45] do it because that's what the bible says
[20:48] i don't curse that's because you know
[20:50] what the one that curses god left me
[20:54] amen
[20:55] and the holy ghost is there where it
[20:57] used to be
[20:58] amen same way with all of us
[21:01] if you're if you're born again
[21:03] are in your journey so let's read
[21:07] number one and the masterpiece
[21:11] everybody all right
[21:12] amen
[21:15] and then come finally the great head the
[21:16] head of it all now we're going to talk
[21:17] about that a little bit later we're
[21:19] going to talk about the headstone
[21:21] because look the headstone is not the
[21:22] son of god
[21:24] the headstone's the son of man
[21:26] god in human flesh he was the head of
[21:29] this new race we're going to read it
[21:31] later on he was the beginning of the
[21:33] creation of god that's what god wanted
[21:36] in the beginning is to walk in human
[21:38] flesh with his children with his family
[21:41] on a perfect earth yes you say how you
[21:44] know that brother wait because that's
[21:46] what was there
[21:47] before
[21:48] the fall
[21:50] and that's what's going to be after
[21:52] everything's restored
[21:54] god's going to walk in human flesh with
[21:55] his children
[21:57] on a perfect earth
[21:59] and thank god for the future home where
[22:01] brother brown says
[22:03] god's not going to annihilate this this
[22:05] earth
[22:06] he created it for people to live on
[22:09] his people
[22:11] these other people are just squatters
[22:14] what they're not part of the inheritance
[22:18] you and i are part of the inheritance
[22:21] if we're the children of god
[22:23] and then come finally the great head the
[22:25] head of all of it what if you look that
[22:27] word up that's that's the number one
[22:29] that's like the father of the head of a
[22:31] family he's the one that's the that's
[22:34] the head and everything else is below it
[22:35] same way with me and you
[22:37] he's our head
[22:39] we're the body
[22:40] right
[22:41] the head of it all the rest of the body
[22:43] just spoke of it the foundation was laid
[22:45] by the patriarchs now see in the old
[22:47] testament
[22:48] but the body was built by the word which
[22:50] was the prophets and here comes the head
[22:52] of it all jesus came on the scene so in
[22:55] other words as we were talking the body
[22:57] was built by the old testament
[22:59] prophecies
[23:01] as we read in isaiah 7 verse 13 says
[23:04] behold the virgin shall conceive all
[23:06] right that's how got it started yeah
[23:07] it's how little that's how it got
[23:09] started
[23:11] a virgin shall conceive nothing's ever
[23:13] happened before isaiah walks out and
[23:15] says hey a virgin shall conceive goes
[23:17] back home and his wife says how.
[23:20] how that's never happened before
[23:24] he said i don't know said i just said
[23:26] what god said
[23:28] and now what a prophet does
[23:32] he says what god said that's right god
[23:34] tells him told him to say it
[23:37] and you know what he thought looked at
[23:38] his wife and probably said and it will
[23:40] come to pass
[23:42] it might have took six thousand years
[23:44] four thousand years after isaiah it
[23:45] doesn't matter
[23:48] he spoke it
[23:49] and that's what gabriel
[23:52] built his whole
[23:54] when he comes to mary he built
[23:56] everything on that right there
[23:59] listen if if jesus christ could
[24:02] resurrect
[24:05] on the prophecy of brother ronald said a
[24:08] backslid
[24:09] prophet david said i'll not leave my
[24:11] soul in hell or suffer my holy one to
[24:14] see corruption
[24:15] he said jesus went down to the grave
[24:18] believing that scripture
[24:22] so that's how the body was built
[24:25] jesus steps out on those old testament
[24:27] prophets because what does he keep doing
[24:29] listen he doesn't have a a paul an
[24:31] irenius he doesn't have these people to
[24:33] talk about when jesus walked on the
[24:35] earth he was in the old testament
[24:38] he talked about moses he talked about
[24:40] abraham he talked about isaac he talked
[24:42] about
[24:43] um
[24:44] elijah right because that's all he had
[24:46] to work with
[24:50] but he came exactly
[24:53] the way the old testament prophet said
[24:54] he would come
[24:56] didn't miss it by one scripture
[25:00] and they turned him down
[25:03] isaiah 9 6 says for unto us a child is
[25:05] born
[25:06] unto us a son is given so there you go
[25:08] there's going to be a baby born
[25:10] a child is born so he's going to come
[25:13] through the womb of a woman he's not
[25:14] going to be just like boom and there he
[25:16] is
[25:17] he's not going to be adam like adam was
[25:18] created a grown man no because you
[25:20] weren't created a grown man
[25:22] you came as a baby
[25:24] so jesus had to come as a baby to be our
[25:26] kinsmen amen
[25:29] i know this is elementary but you know
[25:31] what
[25:32] pretty good to me
[25:34] for unto us a child is born unto us the
[25:35] son is given and the government shall be
[25:37] upon his shoulder
[25:38] his name shall be called wonderful
[25:40] counsel of the mighty god the
[25:41] everlasting father
[25:43] the prince of peace of the increase of
[25:45] his government and peace there shall be
[25:47] no end now
[25:49] i could see caiaphas
[25:51] and some of those high priests reading
[25:53] this scripture because they do read this
[25:55] scripture
[25:56] they read the they read the bible they
[25:58] write they have the old testament
[25:59] scrolls
[26:01] they read this scripture and they're
[26:02] going
[26:04] man when when the messiah gets here
[26:08] he's going to come right into this
[26:10] temple
[26:12] and he's going to say oh great caiaphas
[26:16] here i am
[26:18] because he's going to have a government
[26:20] he's going to bring peace because
[26:22] remember jesus was born under the rule
[26:25] of rome
[26:26] that was roman that was ruling the jews
[26:29] in jerusalem
[26:30] they weren't free people they were
[26:32] almost slaves
[26:34] right
[26:35] so confidence and all them are going
[26:36] like man you know and even even they're
[26:38] gonna say even uh john the baptist said
[26:41] oh he'll make the high places low and
[26:43] the low place is high he's gonna take
[26:45] the curves in the road and he's gonna
[26:46] pull him straight boy when he gets here
[26:49] well he got there
[26:52] and he came the way the bible said
[26:54] but he didn't come the way they thought
[26:56] he should come
[26:59] that's the same way with me and you
[27:00] folks
[27:01] if we're to live the life of the son of
[27:03] man it's got to make you different
[27:06] than the rest of the world
[27:08] like what bob was talking about this
[27:10] morning and what we were talking about
[27:11] last night
[27:12] this
[27:13] this message of the hour
[27:15] will separate you
[27:17] if you live it
[27:19] now see you can limit live a
[27:20] denominational life and you still smoke
[27:22] drink cuts and do what you've been doing
[27:24] now i know that because i've been around
[27:25] them people
[27:28] what do they get saved from
[27:31] i was just with one the other day and
[27:32] he's like i don't see anything wrong
[27:34] with having a little dream i said you're
[27:36] baptist
[27:37] yeah but i just don't see anything
[27:38] there's nothing really that tells me i
[27:40] can't do that
[27:43] and i started to say
[27:45] but i've got a little bit better than i
[27:46] used to i should have said your pastor
[27:49] should have told you that
[27:52] because it's in the bible it says that
[27:54] for you not to
[27:57] you this is the temple of the holy ghost
[27:59] for you not to make put anything in it
[28:01] that you can't use
[28:03] but i didn't i just kind of he said i
[28:05] don't know how you see it he said but
[28:07] that's the way i see it i said okay
[28:08] you're fine you whatever you want
[28:10] how you gonna change their mind
[28:13] because they're told when they go to
[28:15] church they can go in go drive down the
[28:17] road
[28:19] they're walking in church with shorts on
[28:23] baseball hats
[28:25] carrying their starbucks coffee
[28:28] now is that god no but you can't tell
[28:31] them that because they go to church
[28:34] but now listen like we were talking
[28:36] about last night are we though
[28:39] so blinded that we can be sitting in
[28:41] this church
[28:44] and have a laundry list of what we do do
[28:47] and what we don't do
[28:49] and that's your salvation no
[28:51] somewhere
[28:53] you look at all the people that are
[28:54] leaving the message somewhere there's a
[28:57] crack in that foundation
[28:59] and you start building something on top
[29:01] of it it will fall
[29:04] but if you've got the new birth
[29:07] that's right
[29:08] we were talking about last night the the
[29:10] difference in the new birth and the holy
[29:12] ghost because there is a difference
[29:16] you can be anointed with the holy ghost
[29:17] and i didn't read it last night but
[29:18] remember joel promised
[29:21] joel 2 said i'll pour out my spirit
[29:23] upon all flesh
[29:25] so everybody's anointed
[29:28] brother brown said you can't tell that
[29:29] woman not to wear a pair of shorts cause
[29:31] why
[29:32] she's anointed
[29:35] she's anointed with something false but
[29:36] she's anointed
[29:39] and you can have the holy spirit on your
[29:40] spirit every day of your life and die
[29:42] and go to hell you'll be just as black
[29:44] inside your soul as satan is yes
[29:48] that's the anointing the anointed ones
[29:50] that's the anointing it's the true
[29:51] anointing of god we were talking about
[29:53] last night but listen that's the
[29:54] difference in the holy ghost you can
[29:56] have the holy ghost every day of your
[29:57] life and die and go to hell but you
[29:59] can't have the new birth
[30:02] you can't have that new birth down in
[30:03] your soul and die and go to hell i'll
[30:05] promise you that
[30:07] you've already been to hell because you
[30:09] know what jesus took his soul to hell
[30:12] preached to the people that were in
[30:13] prison come back up picked his body up
[30:16] and said all power in heaven and earth
[30:17] has been given unto me and in 10 days if
[30:20] you'll go to jerusalem and get up in
[30:21] that upper room i'll bring every little
[30:23] bit of this
[30:25] and i'm going to give it to you
[30:27] amen
[30:29] you love the lord
[30:30] you got to it's a perfect plan he it's
[30:33] perfect there is no way
[30:35] man has messed with it for thousands of
[30:37] years
[30:38] but it's perfect yes
[30:40] and the perfection is here not coming
[30:44] not a new message
[30:47] this is it but i'm telling you you can
[30:48] sit and die in a message church too just
[30:50] like they sit and die in the
[30:51] denominational church
[30:53] you gotta know that you know that you
[30:54] know that when you come to church that
[30:56] that was one of the questions how do you
[30:58] really know
[31:00] you got the new birth
[31:04] how do you really know
[31:06] well
[31:07] look at your life
[31:09] like bob's talking about this morning
[31:11] look at your journey from a
[31:14] to today
[31:17] amen
[31:18] because maybe five years ago eight years
[31:20] ago six years ago ten years ago twenty
[31:21] years ago you're sitting in a bar on
[31:23] sunday morning because you'd watch
[31:24] football all night
[31:27] and you had to sober up
[31:30] hello
[31:31] let's get down on earth or you smoked a
[31:33] cigarette or you didn't even go to
[31:34] church but look at you now
[31:37] you're here with a desire not here just
[31:39] because disguise the door's open it's a
[31:42] nice warm place to be
[31:47] we come here to hear from god
[31:50] that's what my soul feeds on is to hear
[31:52] from god
[31:52] [Applause]
[31:57] and and we were talking last night and
[32:00] and i'm probably i was the only truthful
[32:02] one in the whole building
[32:04] i said i have been to church and didn't
[32:06] get a revelation
[32:08] and everybody's going
[32:12] but i was the only truthful one of the
[32:14] bunch
[32:15] i have sat in church and not got a
[32:17] revelation but i promise you there was
[32:19] something to build on
[32:22] that a month later
[32:24] you've done it how many times you heard
[32:26] brother dale say something over and over
[32:27] again and you just i mean you just brain
[32:30] dead right through it
[32:33] hello
[32:35] and then all of a sudden though what did
[32:37] the holy ghost tell you he said i'll
[32:39] bring things to your remembrance
[32:42] whatsoever i have said unto you
[32:47] amen
[32:48] that's his job
[32:50] and if he does bring it back that's the
[32:52] holy ghost
[32:54] that's something you can put a stamp on
[32:56] you can put a seal on
[32:58] satan will never do that
[33:01] he'll never he can't even give you a
[33:03] revelation
[33:06] he hates revelation
[33:08] amen but we love it
[33:11] so do you know you got the new birth if
[33:13] god keeps revealing things to you and
[33:15] keeps revealing things to you
[33:19] i'd say that's a pretty good
[33:22] showing
[33:24] that you got the new birth
[33:27] is that what responds inside of you
[33:29] not maybe immediately
[33:32] so that's going to help some of you
[33:33] going to go man i thought i was the only
[33:35] one who didn't get anything out of that
[33:36] service no there's several times that
[33:37] you don't get anything
[33:40] but i'm telling you
[33:42] god promised how many times have you
[33:45] read scripture
[33:46] and swore they added that about two
[33:48] weeks later because you didn't read it
[33:49] the first time you read it hello well it
[33:52] was still there
[33:54] how many times have you read a message
[33:55] book and you read it and i'm going to
[33:57] read this quote from the masterpiece
[33:58] 1964
[34:00] the entire handiwork of god we find in
[34:02] him the perfect reflection of the word
[34:04] and you just read that book a week ago
[34:06] and you never read that
[34:08] it got added afterwards
[34:12] no it wasn't your time to get it
[34:15] you get it in your time
[34:17] you don't get it in brother
[34:19] zach's time your time your you get it in
[34:22] your time
[34:24] amen
[34:25] but see that's the way i know i got the
[34:27] new birth is that continues on
[34:30] and on
[34:31] and on even though you have a dry day
[34:33] listen we walked in the valley of the
[34:35] shadow of death
[34:37] we walked in dark places and where it
[34:39] was just absolutely like brother gary
[34:41] atkins used to say he said
[34:43] man he said three months and lord where
[34:46] are you at
[34:47] i ain't got anything in three months you
[34:49] know that's pretty dry
[34:50] but god didn't say he was going to talk
[34:52] to you every day
[34:55] he talks to you sometimes when you need
[34:57] it
[34:58] that other guy talks to you all the time
[35:00] all right amen
[35:03] i don't know how i got off on that but
[35:05] still maybe it'll help somebody that's
[35:07] sitting there today going i ain't
[35:08] getting a thing he's saying
[35:10] okay
[35:11] okay so
[35:12] if you don't that's okay but you know
[35:14] what god will bring back to your
[35:15] remembrance he'll give another preacher
[35:17] will be preaching somewhere maybe three
[35:18] months from now you'll hear somebody on
[35:20] the tape you'll hear brother branham and
[35:22] you'll go
[35:23] that's what he was saying well that's a
[35:25] revelation satan is not going to give
[35:27] you that he's going to try he's going to
[35:29] try everything in the world to keep you
[35:30] from watching that
[35:32] person online or listening to that tape
[35:36] but if you connect with that
[35:38] see that's god
[35:40] connecting with god
[35:42] that's the new birth it's god connecting
[35:45] to god
[35:46] because what is in your birth it's jesus
[35:48] christ
[35:50] inside of you
[35:52] in the office of the holy ghost
[35:54] not another person or a different person
[35:57] all right well i'm not going to get
[35:58] finished with this
[36:01] all right let's go to isaiah 53 real
[36:03] quick
[36:05] if i don't we'll get this afternoon i
[36:06] want to get to i want to get to a port
[36:08] apart right here first
[36:10] i was isaiah 53 who has believed our
[36:12] report how many of you believe what the
[36:14] report is
[36:15] what is your report the report's what
[36:17] the bible says the reports what the
[36:19] preacher says if he preaches the right
[36:20] truth amen and to whom is the arm of the
[36:23] lord revealed or the power there's power
[36:25] behind revelation that's why satan hates
[36:28] revelation more than anything it's
[36:30] because you get power
[36:32] from revelation
[36:34] i do you should get power when when when
[36:36] you have an aha moment oh that's what
[36:39] that meant
[36:40] well then see that stuck with you your
[36:43] entire life
[36:44] if that's a revelation from god it's a
[36:47] peace that fits somewhere
[36:51] in the statue of a perfect man
[36:54] and if it fits right the bible says
[36:56] fitly join together
[36:58] that we grow up into god if it fitly
[37:01] joined together there's no cracks satan
[37:03] can't get in the crack
[37:05] because he's going to try
[37:07] he's going to try to get into crack
[37:08] that's why you got to have the holy
[37:09] ghost first in your soul as we were
[37:11] talking last night that seals you until
[37:14] the day of your redemption then you've
[37:15] got growth development after that
[37:17] because you know what brother brown
[37:18] talks about the boxcar we didn't talk
[37:19] about this last night but he's got the
[37:21] box car you got product in the box car
[37:23] you got a guy that packs it full you got
[37:25] a guy that seals it
[37:28] but it's got to get to its destination
[37:31] or the product is no good
[37:34] so it's got a what a journey
[37:38] but it's sealed
[37:39] until the day that that gets to where
[37:41] it's supposed to go
[37:44] so it's a journey
[37:46] your journey
[37:48] and listen if you haven't grown any this
[37:50] year
[37:52] or or in even in the past let's just say
[37:54] a year if you haven't grown in a year
[37:56] i'd seriously consider
[37:58] maybe trying to get the new birth
[38:02] i just said we couldn't grow a lot but
[38:04] i'm i'm giving us a year bro bob 365
[38:07] days now so i'm kind of giving a little
[38:08] bit of grace for all of us
[38:10] if you're not better off with god than
[38:12] you were a year ago you got a problem
[38:14] let's just let's just look at each other
[38:16] look at yourself in the mirror and say
[38:17] look i got a problem
[38:19] maybe i ain't born again maybe i'm just
[38:21] struggling around here in sanctification
[38:22] and that's okay cause the unclean spirit
[38:24] goes out but there's the spirit gonna
[38:26] come back in i'll promise you
[38:28] and fill you with something cause you
[38:30] didn't get it sealed
[38:32] but you need to get if you get it sealed
[38:33] then it come what may
[38:35] it can rain it can rain on that uh box
[38:38] car it can get cold it can get hot but
[38:42] the product inside is going to stay
[38:43] there
[38:44] same way with me and you all right
[38:47] free shall grow up before him as a
[38:48] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[38:50] he has no form or commonness in other
[38:52] words he's not a good looking guy and
[38:54] when we shall see him there's no beauty
[38:55] that we should desire him
[38:58] wouldn't you think i mean if god was
[39:00] coming down in human flesh
[39:02] it'd be the best of the best
[39:04] we would think
[39:06] caiaphas thought that way look at the
[39:08] roman catholic church they put
[39:09] everything they got in what beauty
[39:12] beauty beautiful this or or even
[39:14] denominations they'll say boy we built
[39:16] this great big beautiful church
[39:19] and it's got usb ports in the back so we
[39:21] can plug our phones in
[39:23] and we can set our coffee and they stay
[39:25] warm in this little warmer right behind
[39:27] the seat
[39:29] and y'all would probably want warmers in
[39:31] the seat or air conditioners in the seat
[39:33] that's right sister i know you would
[39:37] but it would be have to be controlled
[39:39] individually
[39:41] because some of you would turn it up and
[39:42] some of you be this and you turn it down
[39:44] and some of you be going
[39:46] in here
[39:47] yeah so anyway that's the convenience
[39:49] but see that's beauty there was no
[39:51] beauty that we should desire him there
[39:53] was no beauty in jesus there was a lot
[39:55] of times jesus was walking around and
[39:56] people didn't even know who he was
[39:59] didn't know who he was
[40:00] remember the bible says he disappeared
[40:02] in the crowd
[40:03] why he just looked like the rest of them
[40:06] because even one time they said it's not
[40:08] joseph's boy
[40:09] saw him in a carpenter shop ain't that
[40:11] joseph's boy
[40:12] no that wasn't joseph boy
[40:14] that was god's boy
[40:16] amen he is despised and rejected of men
[40:19] so now look this is the characteristic
[40:21] of the son of man
[40:24] in the end time we're promised the
[40:27] manifestation of the son of man
[40:30] in the end time which is god in human
[40:32] flesh so if this is the way he acts
[40:35] that's the way we're supposed to act no
[40:38] different
[40:39] he is despised and rejected of men so
[40:42] don't worry
[40:43] a man of sorrow and acquainted with
[40:45] grief
[40:46] had a lot of friends leave us haven't we
[40:48] when we come into the message and come
[40:49] into the truth and then as we get more
[40:51] truth we have a lot of our friends that
[40:53] were in the message with us that don't
[40:55] even want to talk to us no more hello
[40:57] somebody
[40:58] right
[41:01] when jesus went to the cross when he
[41:03] manifested the son of man
[41:07] he was by himself
[41:10] no one
[41:11] was around him to help him
[41:13] they ran
[41:15] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[41:17] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[41:20] surely he hath borne our grief and
[41:22] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[41:24] him stricken
[41:25] smitten of god you know even when he was
[41:27] hanging on the cross caiaphas and all
[41:29] them were looking at him and they said
[41:30] oh he says he can save
[41:32] the world and he came save himself you
[41:34] know what they were saying
[41:36] god our god our jehovah
[41:40] has now passed judgment on this man that
[41:43] thought he was god
[41:45] look at him hanging there that can't be
[41:46] god hanging on a cross naked
[41:51] condemned
[41:52] to die
[41:54] and hanging there under the cruelest
[41:55] punishment you could get
[41:57] i'm sure they were like you know grab
[41:58] their
[41:59] grab their coats you know and they're
[42:01] like we won't ever see him again
[42:04] god has passed judgment on this man
[42:07] because of what he did
[42:10] he just ruined our denomination
[42:12] he just ruined our thought process
[42:17] oh little did they know
[42:20] little did they know
[42:23] that was god
[42:25] but he was and you know what confidence
[42:27] is going to see him again
[42:29] at too
[42:29] white throne judgment
[42:32] but he was wounded for our
[42:33] transgressions
[42:35] he was bruised for our iniquity
[42:38] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[42:40] him
[42:42] and with his stripes
[42:44] we are healed
[42:46] you need healing today read that
[42:47] scripture for yourself but he was
[42:48] wounded for wake dale's transgression
[42:53] i almost
[42:54] you get emotional when you read that
[42:57] because that's what god did
[43:00] this is so simple salvation but that's
[43:01] what god did for your whole journey
[43:04] and remember he had to come in human
[43:06] flesh
[43:07] because you can't
[43:09] whip
[43:12] the son of god
[43:15] son of god can't die
[43:18] we're going to read here in just a
[43:19] minute what the son of god is going to
[43:21] do
[43:22] because he gave his soul a ransom
[43:24] but he gave his body a sacrifice just
[43:26] like a lamb
[43:28] he took the stripes on his literal body
[43:30] for me and you
[43:32] that's the lamb of god
[43:34] that john introduced
[43:36] that takes away the sin of the world
[43:39] but remember it wasn't the box not the
[43:40] body that saves you
[43:43] the body of jesus don't save you
[43:47] the body of jesus didn't come back into
[43:48] you in the holy ghost
[43:51] it was the soul of god
[43:53] the son of god
[43:55] the genesis 1 26 man that was before the
[43:57] foundation of the world god
[43:59] amen
[44:01] all we like sheep have gone astray
[44:04] we have turned everyone to his own way
[44:07] and the lord has laid on him the
[44:08] iniquity of us all
[44:10] did he not do that
[44:16] he didn't have a lot of fun when he was
[44:17] on earth
[44:19] he was oppressed
[44:21] he was afflicted yet he opened not his
[44:23] mouth
[44:24] we were talking about that last night
[44:26] we're having some people having trouble
[44:28] around here with temperance and
[44:30] tempers and all that stuff how many days
[44:43] but what about a man though listen what
[44:45] about a man
[44:46] he was every wet man right
[44:50] he would stand before caiaphas
[44:53] or he would stand before pilate
[44:56] the pilot says you king
[44:58] he said to this end i was born
[45:02] but see pilate realized that this one
[45:04] man
[45:06] was not going to hurt him
[45:09] he had the power of rome behind him he
[45:11] had 10 000 soldiers he had all the
[45:13] latest equipment
[45:15] and here stood a man didn't hardly have
[45:17] clothes on
[45:20] it wasn't a threat to pilot because
[45:21] pilot what pilots say he said i don't
[45:23] see no fault in him let him go
[45:25] if he's got a kingdom
[45:28] he can't fight me
[45:31] but that man remember he said i could
[45:34] call
[45:35] how many legions of angels
[45:39] to make this all go away
[45:41] you talking about statue of a perfect
[45:43] man you talking about not my will but
[45:44] thy will be done try that sometime
[45:48] try that when some soldier is going to
[45:50] beat you half to death
[45:52] with a cat of nine tails and just
[45:55] drive
[45:57] drive i'm talking about pushing a crown
[46:00] of thorns
[46:01] in your head they didn't just gently lay
[46:02] it on there and said oh you're the king
[46:04] no i'm sure they took that and probably
[46:06] took a piece of leather so they wouldn't
[46:08] get
[46:08] stuck their self and they pressed it
[46:10] down
[46:11] in jesus's head and you know what yet he
[46:13] opened not his mouth
[46:14] he didn't revile back
[46:18] that's what's supposed to be inside of
[46:20] you and me
[46:23] he was oppressed flicked yet he opened
[46:24] his mouth he was brought as a lamb to
[46:26] the slaughter and as a sheep before her
[46:28] shears dumb so he opened not his mouth
[46:29] didn't say a word
[46:31] he was taken from prison and from
[46:32] judgment
[46:34] and who shall declare his generation
[46:36] we've talked about this before for he
[46:38] was cut off
[46:39] out of the land of the living now here's
[46:41] isaiah
[46:42] isaiah knows this man's got to be human
[46:44] flesh because isaiah is the one in
[46:46] isaiah 7 said behold a virgin shall
[46:49] conceive so they knew those old
[46:51] testament prophets knew that god was
[46:53] going to come in human flesh
[46:56] it's just that the
[46:57] denominations of the day or the
[46:59] hierarchy of the day didn't believe it
[47:01] so what'd they do they didn't just they
[47:03] killed the prophet they shut the
[47:04] prophets up
[47:06] didn't what jesus said jesus said you
[47:08] wanted walls
[47:10] you go out there and you and what were
[47:11] they doing they were washing the tomb of
[47:13] isaiah boy we just we got this thing it
[47:15] looks should we shine this baby up jesus
[47:18] said you the way to put them in there
[47:21] you put them in there you're the one who
[47:23] put your body in that grave and you're
[47:24] and you're wiping it off because of your
[47:26] tradition
[47:28] he was cut off with the land of living
[47:29] in other words he didn't have any
[47:31] natural progeny
[47:33] he didn't need a national
[47:35] natural progeny
[47:37] his progeny was spiritual
[47:39] his genealogy and generation was
[47:41] spiritual it was not natural
[47:43] it was that genesis 1 26 man
[47:45] that was made in his image and he made
[47:47] his grave with the wicked with the rich
[47:49] in his death because he had done no
[47:51] violence neither was any deceit in his
[47:53] mouth sounds like a pretty good statue
[47:54] of perfect man god
[47:56] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[47:57] look he has put him to grief
[47:59] when thou shalt make his soul
[48:03] an offering for sin
[48:05] his soul
[48:08] he shall what see his seed
[48:11] see his progeny
[48:12] when he will give his soul
[48:15] an offering for sin he shall see his
[48:17] seed he shall prolong his days and the
[48:18] pleasures of the lord shall prosper in
[48:19] his lamb
[48:21] he shall see the travail of his soul and
[48:23] shall be satisfied
[48:25] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[48:27] servant justify many for he shall bear
[48:28] their iniquities look therefore will i
[48:30] divide him a portion with the great
[48:34] jesus got an inheritance
[48:36] amen
[48:38] jesus got an inheritance
[48:40] and he shall divide the spoil with a
[48:42] strong because he hath poured out his
[48:44] soul unto death not in death
[48:47] unto death
[48:48] he acted the part of death the soul just
[48:50] came out of the body and where did it go
[48:52] it went to hell and preached to the
[48:54] souls in prison
[48:55] and the long suffering of the days of
[48:56] noah right
[48:59] and you were in him when that happened
[49:02] so you've already been to hell
[49:05] you don't ever have to go again
[49:07] amen
[49:09] that thrills my heart because you know
[49:10] what if i identify myself with that man
[49:12] and he went there i don't have to go
[49:15] i don't have to stand judgment
[49:17] he took my transgression
[49:19] he made intercession for my
[49:21] transgression like we were talking about
[49:23] last night the holy ghost is an advocate
[49:26] you can't be be an advocate for yourself
[49:30] that's not allowed
[49:33] in a court i mean some people try to do
[49:34] that but they can't
[49:36] they bitterly fail
[49:39] when you try to be your own lawyer
[49:41] yeah anyway
[49:42] so you have an advocate though that
[49:44] stands up and said hey
[49:46] i'll take his sin
[49:48] i'll take whatever it is that he has or
[49:50] she has whatever it is i'll take it
[49:53] an advocate that stands in your place
[49:56] and says i'll take what this person has
[49:59] he made intercession
[50:02] for the transgressors and that's me and
[50:04] you
[50:07] you love the lord
[50:10] now we know that the baby got here we're
[50:13] not we're gonna skip through all that
[50:16] the baby got here he came exactly the
[50:18] way they said let's go to um if you
[50:20] would go to quote number two god's gift
[50:22] always find their places and i'm gonna
[50:25] back up those two scriptures
[50:28] remember he fulfilled all the scriptures
[50:30] he came as a baby he came swaddling
[50:32] clothes he came in a manger
[50:34] he came in bethlehem
[50:36] micah prophesied that he would come in
[50:39] bethlehem so he came exactly the way
[50:43] the bible said he was going to come
[50:45] and even when herod heard about this he
[50:48] inquires and says where's this king
[50:50] supposed to be born
[50:52] so they knew the scrolls he wasn't a
[50:54] heathen
[50:56] he knew the scripture
[50:58] and they told him they said oh he's to
[50:59] be born in bethlehem
[51:02] bethlehem
[51:04] well if those two wise men saw that and
[51:06] they took them two years to get here
[51:08] because remember the wise men didn't see
[51:10] a baby
[51:12] the wise man saw a child
[51:15] because the bible says the young child
[51:16] was sitting in the mother's lap
[51:18] sitting so he was older
[51:21] why did herod say okay everybody from
[51:23] two years old and down i'm gonna kill
[51:25] them all
[51:26] so because he was gonna try to get jesus
[51:29] and kill him in between those two years
[51:30] right
[51:32] so now watch here
[51:34] what happens with the magi
[51:38] and watch these people these magi they
[51:39] brought him watch the gifts they brought
[51:41] him identified what they thought he was
[51:44] they brought him gold frankincense and
[51:46] myrrh
[51:47] now watch what these symbols that i want
[51:49] to talk to you about now is what these
[51:51] symbols mean now i've got some scripture
[51:53] wrote out here that we'll read just in a
[51:55] moment
[51:56] lord willing now
[51:58] gold frankincense and myrrh
[52:00] now gold in the bible how feeling it
[52:02] fits to christ because gold speaks of
[52:05] deity
[52:06] gold is deity what did they do
[52:09] even if they made something out of brass
[52:11] even if they made something out of wood
[52:13] in the old testament they overlaid it
[52:15] with gold
[52:16] to make it deity or deified and if
[52:18] anybody's going to make a a a god
[52:22] a little idol what's usually made out of
[52:24] it's either got some gold in it or on it
[52:27] why because they signify that with deity
[52:30] well you didn't have to put anything on
[52:31] jesus he was deity
[52:34] amen
[52:35] he was gold
[52:36] gold is deity we'll get to that in just
[52:38] a moment frankincense speaks of service
[52:41] and myrrh is death god deity and service
[52:44] to die and that's what he was the very
[52:46] thing that they brought identified what
[52:49] they thought he was
[52:51] now let's go number three
[52:54] now how fitting
[52:57] these things it's a different
[53:00] different quote
[53:02] fitted exactly the commission from god
[53:03] in his journey on earth
[53:07] now watch this now the first thing god
[53:10] this was god
[53:12] jesus was god in the form of a man
[53:16] that's hard for people to swallow that
[53:19] even today
[53:21] that he was god
[53:23] that's what he was
[53:25] he wasn't nothing less than god
[53:28] he was god manifested in flesh
[53:32] he was the creator
[53:34] in his own creation
[53:36] now he was the creator in his creation
[53:39] by the creation for the creation
[53:44] he liked that so much he said it again
[53:46] he was a creator of his creation by his
[53:48] creation for his creation
[53:51] all whines right back in god the whole
[53:53] thing don't you see fullness of god
[53:56] he was a creator in so much that he was
[53:59] god and he was a being on earth a being
[54:02] of time
[54:05] which meant that he must have had a
[54:06] beginning
[54:08] the body
[54:11] therefore he created himself a body to
[54:14] live in
[54:16] god himself created a body for himself
[54:19] that by his creation he might save the
[54:22] lost creation that he created
[54:25] everything's got to do with creation
[54:28] and there was jehovah
[54:30] lying there crying like a baby can you
[54:31] imagine it the next quote number four
[54:33] god's wrapped gift number five
[54:36] he was god and became man not rich man
[54:39] poor man
[54:41] that's the super sign that's number five
[54:47] watch this let's read the red down here
[54:49] when that first little toothless mouth
[54:52] opened in that manger
[54:54] on that first crib first christmas
[54:56] morning in his little manger crib the
[54:58] first little yell that went from his
[54:59] voice that was god crying how many of
[55:01] you can believe that
[55:06] how many can you believe
[55:09] that that's what god did
[55:12] the first little toothless mouth opened
[55:14] in the manger
[55:17] the first little christmas morning in
[55:19] his little manger crib the first little
[55:20] yell that went forth that was god crying
[55:23] jehovah crying a man come from god and
[55:25] was man ever went man
[55:28] came to the world with nothing but still
[55:30] man what was he trying to do what was he
[55:32] purposing he cried like a baby
[55:35] in the manger he played like a boy on
[55:37] the street he talled like a man but yet
[55:40] he was emmanuel
[55:42] this is the super sign
[55:43] god dwelling in the creation that he
[55:45] created the super sign it shall be a
[55:48] sign unto you he was so poor when he
[55:50] came to the earth he came through a
[55:52] barred womb
[55:55] a barred womb of a woman and had to
[55:56] borrow a grave to be buried in
[55:59] remember joseph for armathea they just
[56:01] dug the grave and nobody had been in it
[56:03] before
[56:04] and that's where they put jesus now
[56:06] a virgin shall conceive without sexual
[56:08] interception jehovah barred the womb of
[56:10] mary a woman to perform the duty
[56:13] that he'd give an everlasting sign and
[56:15] was so poor on earth after 33 years and
[56:17] a half of ministry he had to borrow a
[56:19] grave to be buried in can you imagine
[56:21] talk about immaculate conception what
[56:23] meanest thou
[56:25] anyhow
[56:26] all right let's finish right here
[56:28] revelations 3 14 this is what i want to
[56:30] get to
[56:33] now are we not in the layout to see in
[56:35] church age
[56:37] i know we're called out of the age
[56:39] because we're bribed but we're living in
[56:41] the time of the laodicea
[56:45] boy if you don't believe that
[56:46] oh lordy
[56:48] you're deceived
[56:50] you're way past this eve if there is a
[56:52] thing
[56:54] because every characteristic of this
[56:56] layout out of sin age we see it manifest
[57:00] today in the world and in people and
[57:02] everything
[57:03] but now watch what he says though and
[57:05] unto the angel of the church of the
[57:07] layout of sins right
[57:10] now what's the angel the church allowed
[57:11] to say
[57:13] we've heard his voice
[57:15] okay
[57:17] these things say at the amen
[57:19] the faithful and true witness
[57:21] the beginning
[57:23] of the creation of god
[57:26] now
[57:27] that's strange because how can god be
[57:31] created
[57:33] and this says he's the beginning
[57:35] whatever this person is is the beginning
[57:37] of the creation of god
[57:39] all right
[57:40] let's let the prophet
[57:42] tell us in the layout to see in church
[57:44] age
[57:45] so let's go to the quote the 14th verse
[57:47] to the angel of the lord of laodicea
[57:49] right these things which saith amen the
[57:51] faithful and true witness the beginning
[57:53] of the creation of god oh my
[57:55] we got all we had all night on that
[57:57] right there how the lord would reveal
[57:59] that to us watch
[58:01] the amen is the last
[58:03] he's appeared
[58:05] all the way down through in different
[58:06] things but here's the last church age
[58:08] where it says this is the finish i am
[58:11] the last.
[58:12] now to show that he was the first also
[58:14] as he was
[58:15] he's the beginning of the creation of
[58:17] god oh do you catch it how could god be
[58:20] created if he's a spirit
[58:24] son of god can't be created
[58:27] it is the creator
[58:29] that's the one we were talking about the
[58:30] logos to when we went way back before
[58:32] time brother brown said that was the son
[58:34] of god that was the creator that was
[58:36] that was god stepping over in another
[58:38] form so that we can understand who he is
[58:41] all right how could he be
[58:44] he's eternal
[58:46] he never was created he never will be
[58:48] created because he was god at the
[58:51] beginning
[58:52] but he that as the beginning of the
[58:54] creation of god was jesus christ when he
[58:56] was made manifest
[59:01] a little toothless baby
[59:03] laying in the manger
[59:05] when god lived in him he is god's
[59:07] creation oh my see the first and the
[59:09] last the amen the beginning of the
[59:10] creation of god
[59:12] when god created himself a body what i
[59:15] read in hebrews 10 5 a body
[59:17] thou has prepared me thou who the
[59:19] prophets
[59:22] god threw the prophets
[59:24] he created himself a body to live him
[59:26] when god created himself a body he came
[59:29] down and lived in it that's the
[59:30] beginning of the creation of god see oh
[59:33] isn't he
[59:34] wonderful
[59:36] and now we read
[59:39] john 1 14 says and the word was made
[59:42] flesh
[59:44] and dwelt among us
[59:48] jesus christ
[59:50] was the way we were supposed to come
[59:54] had there not been a fall
[1:00:00] because as the fall happened
[1:00:03] to restore what was fallen it had to
[1:00:05] come the same way
[1:00:07] except for no sex
[1:00:09] because isaiah said it wouldn't be by
[1:00:11] sex it wouldn't be by instrumentation of
[1:00:14] man it would be by god creating that's
[1:00:17] what he was going to do to begin with
[1:00:20] how many times you hear that word create
[1:00:21] create create create god's a creator
[1:00:27] but he let us fall
[1:00:30] knowing we would fall
[1:00:32] he let us fall in human flesh
[1:00:35] so that he can make himself human flesh
[1:00:38] because that's what he always wanted
[1:00:40] was to be a god that we can handle
[1:00:45] shake hands with touch hug his neck
[1:00:49] even the disciples after jesus left they
[1:00:52] said we've touched the word of god
[1:00:54] because they literally did but they
[1:00:56] didn't understand who he was
[1:00:58] they all if they didn't knew who he was
[1:01:00] they wouldn't run from him that night he
[1:01:01] got crucified
[1:01:03] they didn't exactly know who the son of
[1:01:05] man was
[1:01:06] they knew he was different but see you
[1:01:07] and i in the end time and we'll start
[1:01:09] this afternoon
[1:01:11] with this man as he walks through his
[1:01:13] journey
[1:01:15] he is the son of man
[1:01:18] and there's no one like him on the earth
[1:01:22] the prophet of god william branham was
[1:01:24] close enough as anybody could get but he
[1:01:26] was not the son of man
[1:01:29] because
[1:01:31] what did i say the other day the
[1:01:32] characteristics of the son of man
[1:01:35] the son of man is he's got to be virgin
[1:01:37] born
[1:01:38] so that just
[1:01:40] discludes
[1:01:43] everybody
[1:01:45] since
[1:01:47] abel
[1:01:49] and cain
[1:01:51] until today
[1:01:52] only one person
[1:01:54] was born
[1:01:56] virgin born
[1:01:57] and that was the son of man
[1:01:59] the head of the church we'll read a
[1:02:01] little bit later on that's why he was
[1:02:03] made the head of the church he's the
[1:02:04] head of the church he got a body
[1:02:07] a body now has prepared me and now he's
[1:02:10] preparing a body a bride
[1:02:13] through what through the word of god by
[1:02:15] spoken word is the original seed
[1:02:18] not by anything that man's going to do
[1:02:21] man doesn't run this church
[1:02:24] the holy ghost runs this church
[1:02:27] the son of god
[1:02:29] the baptism of the holy ghost but what
[1:02:31] is he doing though he's changing me and
[1:02:33] you
[1:02:34] as we go up that statue of perfect man
[1:02:36] because look here's the head ship right
[1:02:38] here what is that that's we'll see it
[1:02:40] this afternoon
[1:02:41] if we get to it that was rejected
[1:02:45] the headstone was rejected who is the
[1:02:47] headstone not the son of god
[1:02:53] the son of god wasn't rejected through
[1:02:54] the church ages that's what got him in
[1:02:56] the church age
[1:02:58] but the son of man was rejected
[1:03:01] they lost that stone that revelation
[1:03:05] but he said now that headstone has now
[1:03:08] become what the chief cornerstone
[1:03:11] a little bitty headstone right here this
[1:03:14] whole foundation was on
[1:03:18] proving
[1:03:19] that when he got into this age right now
[1:03:22] today
[1:03:23] we'd know what we're talking about
[1:03:27] because they didn't down there because
[1:03:30] i'll read you in the bible
[1:03:32] where the bible says zerubbabel
[1:03:36] is gonna clean this thing off
[1:03:39] not make a new one
[1:03:42] you can't make a new foundation because
[1:03:44] the foundation of the whole thing is
[1:03:46] built on the apostles and prophets
[1:03:48] jesus christ being the chief what
[1:03:50] cornerstone so you can't do away with it
[1:03:52] but what they done was is they rejected
[1:03:55] him
[1:03:57] all to the church ages they rejected him
[1:03:59] but today
[1:04:00] is the day
[1:04:02] that we don't reject him no more
[1:04:05] today is the day
[1:04:06] of our salvation not just for our soul
[1:04:10] but for our spirit and our body that we
[1:04:11] can live so close to god
[1:04:15] that we'll raise the dead and get out of
[1:04:16] here
[1:04:17] let's stand to our feet
[1:04:19] musicians come
[1:04:23] i know sometimes it's tough to follow
[1:04:25] but
[1:04:27] that's what our requirement is folks in
[1:04:28] this end time
[1:04:30] is to be the son of man
[1:04:33] the lord jesus christ in bride form on
[1:04:36] this earth doing the same thing he did
[1:04:40] and you can't do it with false word
[1:04:43] you got to do it listen
[1:04:46] there wasn't one moment
[1:04:50] one moment in the son of man's life
[1:04:55] that he was wrong
[1:04:57] now he might have made human mistakes he
[1:04:58] probably dropped a fork somewhere he
[1:05:00] stumbled over a a
[1:05:02] a rock on the ground he got scuffed up
[1:05:05] he was a man
[1:05:07] but when he stood up and said i and my
[1:05:09] father are one
[1:05:10] he meant what he said
[1:05:13] when he said all these things all these
[1:05:15] things he said because you know then you
[1:05:18] go well i ain't perfect you ain't
[1:05:19] perfect i've heard that joke all my life
[1:05:22] and it's junk
[1:05:24] the bible says
[1:05:26] be therefore perfect
[1:05:29] and we'll read it this afternoon
[1:05:30] jesus even had to be made perfect
[1:05:32] because it says being made perfect
[1:05:35] became the author of our salvation
[1:05:38] now that wasn't talking about his soul
[1:05:42] i wasn't talking about his soul
[1:05:44] that was talking about his humanity
[1:05:47] that he yielded to the father
[1:05:49] and made that thing live
[1:05:52] so where's that man now brother darny is
[1:05:54] he gone somewhere off and we just we
[1:05:56] there's no access to him see that's what
[1:05:58] the world has said that's why they put
[1:06:00] the son of man out they said we can't
[1:06:02] live that i ain't god and you ain't god
[1:06:05] well that's not what the bible says
[1:06:08] jesus said father i pray
[1:06:12] that they be one
[1:06:15] as you and i are one
[1:06:17] now how was the father and jesus one
[1:06:19] they were one
[1:06:21] so he's praying that we'd be the same
[1:06:24] we just got to believe that there stands
[1:06:26] that man that can do it
[1:06:28] our advocate our high priest
[1:06:30] our healer our redeemer our savior
[1:06:32] don't ever forget what god did for you
[1:06:35] let's sing a song god bless you
[1:06:40] thank you lord
[1:06:44] for
