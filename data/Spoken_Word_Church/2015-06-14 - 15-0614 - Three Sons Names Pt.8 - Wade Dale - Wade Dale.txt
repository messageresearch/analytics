TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hi brother Finn about to be in the center this message is Seneca of the home of everything that stack your perfect man next week in anybody and he may got the the table on their on their iPad you see it change and change last week but the drive time I can't even different here are there and everything about a change click over here that's all all different than what it was before and then you don't have to go anywhere else you get your audio you can smack that so you can listen you can listen to it Oh yep a little bit um hi let's go back to our scripture to love John one one in the beginning was the word world with god and the word love God saying with in the beginning with God all things were made by him what the word okay and without him was not anything made that was made and it was life in life with a lot of men now that like Moses saw that light in a burning books right right then we see that Abraham Abraham I don't he didn't see God except in the Melchizedek ok he talked with God all right but watch how God is condescending down because the Bible says many times it says I've come down i'll come down just the look I've come down to look I've come down like Melchizedek did we leave him he said I've come down to look we didn't have to come down and go look at this ends of Sodom his presence you got after the presence of the almighty is what condemned saw them in tomorrow right he sent the two messengers down to Sado to try to call people out brother Graham said Billy Graham for Robert send him down there to call out of people out of Sodom right but there was a man that stayed there with Abraham call Mel Cassidy and when did he do he's the one that tongue which then you got to tag these things without our tango which to give you don't I tag along him for you tag scripture still learning they're ok we'll just still learn together do it goodbye the Tim him read this friday night with you which is really good let's go down to verse 17 wherein god willing more abundantly to show them to the heirs of promise now who is the heirs of promise that's us we you said all know we're all right go go same place let's go right here let's prove this is this is the Hall of faith right but what's this what's what the Bible says look at verse 39 and these all who all that Old Testament Moses you don't list Elijah but Moses Elijah Isaiah Isaac Jacob everybody this is Tom like the Old Testament right Hebrews 11 is talking about the fade that was in the old testament and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise all right so they didn't receive the promise sure I even have got a promise and he did stand on the promised land but remember it wasn't revealed to it because watch what brother Brad said brother Graham said on the exact spot where male calves making out of Abraham is where that you see is going to push up Abraham was literally walk in on that city that he was looking for the city of who build and legs were done if he would have had that I side of Revelation like we have now because he have enough revelation to know that man was God but to look down and and Melchizedek say you looking for a city in these dear murphy's and stand early you're standing right on the peak of it is right down below your feet and one day when time comes it's going to push up now that's not a coincidence that's a revelation that Melchizedek met Abraham because one is it Abraham etapa the true believer the true believer and God Almighty and human flesh together right but now there was no way that that promise could go into Abraham right the promises in eburg that's the hope the promise the promise that we had was what what was the promise let's go to Genesis find out ones promises this is 315 to me that is the promise that is the way back through Redemption he said I'll God said I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed remember she doesn't woman doesn't have a seat it has to be given a seat so what is that see Christ whose I talking about that right to me that once cookie time I jensen's 126 sure that shows my birth but Genesis previa thing shows my coming forth on my Redemption that's the redemption scripture to me he said well I don't let them at that looks kind of really what does it say it you can't here's what it's saying here's the essence of first big thing Adam you thought you can do it no if you thought you could do it first Adam you thought you could do a you an out God who come back he said I'll honor that he said because that's what I'm gonna do I'm going to go out and get my bride and bring her back she committed adultery right man output empty so in other words I will to me that starts the whole thing right there I will I will I will I will forget your chemistry I will absolutely yes we were born between Satan II Adolphus parents so that one that make us we have to be made virgin by the blood of Jesus Christ man we have to be made a virgin we're not where we're born in San shapen in iniquity I like young brother Tim brought in some of that about a while what happened is it you know remember in Deuteronomy or numbers he talks about talks about bowing about but it also talks about it but maiden goes out and she's in a city and she's getting ready to be defiled if she screams out someone help me then sheep that's not carried to her that's exactly what we did that's exactly what we did we were being taken over by the devil we screamed out father help me and you know what that's not caring to her virginity right and that's what the box said it's not counting for her well see that's the way we are and you know you have to look in you get in the Old Testament you say well what if you're committed adultery you're you're on the take them all out stone David Lee read over there well there was someone don't be going on in and then times and they weren't stoned or killed there were some grace in there somewhere right I same way we need you but I will put enmity no words what does he have a key division I've got to put a division between the what the servants of Satan and the one that was the one moments of church I sighs so I'm going to have to put enmity because if I don't separate myself there will be no act of redemption that's what I see in this picture i see there's no act of redemption if we're all still together right I'll put enmity God said I'm not going to be in other words i'm not going to be able to come down as this man right because brother Graham said Jesus this body would have come to eat so cheap that he would have had the body Jesus would have served one tool oh gosh with a stepped in he's always been named Jesus I got a few quotes when they real he's always been Jesus Christ oh Jesus Christ same yesterday today forever Jesus Christ created all things that word Jesus just didn't develop until he came on earth that was a dirty name all right and you know what differentiates him that's why we've got time for name of the Lord Jesus Christ cover as many Jesuses they playing issues is in them did you know that that Barabbas was first name was Jesus rendang history just the other day brabus his first name was Jesus so there was to Jesus is standing there man took morales and then they brought us Jesus Perales and then Jesus Christ couple of a cross but i will put enmity so God said I'm going to have I can't come down in the cool of the day anymore you have sense so I'm going to put a division between me and you by and between thy seed and her seed by same and the woman so so let's look at this and remember one thing he's not talking about natural seed to me and you there's like bro down said I don't care about me if I was if I was the Beast son don't bother me one bit and then doesn't bother me one bit no I don't do this is not talking about sure sure there have to be a natural seed division but remember there was looks like he said well there's a natural seed division when now Cain and Abel live together for a long time grew up together and then came did what he did and there was a separation so it wasn't that God said well I'm kicking I'm kicking came out you know keeping able no they both come out the same wound they both grew up together and then they made their decision in the process of coming to the age of accountability then they made their own division all right I will put enmity between by the end of one eye so there's going to be the empty between Satan and the church or Satan and woman between thy seed and her seed now remember she don't have a seat so there has to be that Steve was new Jesus Christ she had to be given a seat so here's it shows me God and Jesus Christ and then right here's the finality this is right before we go into the future home Satan now look and it shall bruise thy head did you talk to come to the safe home to saving right he's talking to the devil he's not talking to the servant he's not holding the beach that beast is just going I did I did well I did a little natural yeah i mean really ought to feel like i was doing when I told you know but remember he had no way to reason so it was the devil talking through through the Beast ok what's the devil speaking to the be so God's not speaking to them to the beach he's talking to same alright but when he vicariously used to beast he knew is one thing for sure that's kind of what what gets me is in the end time now what is it it's going to be an obese vicariously Satan's going to enter that code or the Beast to finish this thing off it started with a beast incarnate Satan incarnate obese is going to end saving her nana be all right so that's what this is it shall bruise thy head now if you hit somebody the head you kill but then what rock what's this right here here is my body redemption go ahead and thou Satan shall prove his who whose head see you want Jesus Christ when he was on the cross remember we preached the sermon on beat print foot foot means Redemption where's the heel heel Donna but Jesus Christ was struck for our redemption right never he was dropped on a cross what he didn't he took on e brood he was bruised for a mine iniquity all the Isaiah 53 so the meeting I hope I that brief 15 just humming though Genesis pre-clear theme to show the whole plan of redemption because first class got to separate from if not then there's no redemption don't remember redemptions not replaceable redemption is God and man we've talked about a god man Andy right here together they're talking in the garden there's no fear there's no enmity oh I can walk in the garden Adam would actually finding actually you know they go through the garden brother Brian said many times it that they would walk through the garden and they would feel the pull they would feel the spirit right so they would go to God and they say indeed safe house my children today and all that you know an old house everything going in said he would lay him down and food and sleep why because their body with actually being renewed they had a human body so they had to rest a little uh no because remember what Mady turn all right our bodies are not eternal to we get there Jesus Christ you'll want to have an eternal body flesh body that once was that's why the Bible talks specifically specifically about Mortal to immortal that were immortal means you were mortal one time now you're more because remember angels cannot be more can that's why there's no redemption to angel there's no redemption because there's no mortal and anymore you and I everybody from adam to today not us dying what mortality that's why they call it mortality rate right because we're mortal but there's only one man that's becoming immortal he said well what about Hannah I don't understand that I was going to leave that alone the Bible says one has went to immortality Jesus Christ that means he had a mortal flesh body something happened he died he was changed and now he has an immortal body once that flesh was mortal now say more little in one man that lets Jesus Christ well that's that's where he's going to bruce saving he's going to hit him right in the head kill him but he had to be bruised for us to me that's the that takes the sin he took the sin he took the sin upon himself so ever happens that you see that scripture the tumescent utiful God had to put enmity and then write down here he what he do he puts on man back together again I in flesh all right inflation because you got to remember the Genesis 126 man I hope you see that that jess is 126 man never felt never never never had to be never had to be accused of sin I was a member of you ever accused us in your Sarah that Genesis 1 26 men never sinned he doesn't matter and you say well that's a paradox that if that juice is 136 barrels in Adam and you see what he did I tendencies 1.6 man was indeed and you see what she did because when that collision took over hey that's our problem now my mother's been trying to get us to see if we see that that soul inside of us is the eternal as God is never said today never committed adultery never said a bad word never had a bad fall when I that's in you somewhere our problem is when I let it live out we have built the cocoon around it called sin and Carl line dinner what enmity okay kind of getting off from messaging a little bit but I hope this helps you something but it still it's all the logos it's all and I hope you see this program brother they'll come back the apne and Holy Spirit not we know that's the soul of man when you're going again that same one that created the earth is inside you that's hard to believe but we don't have to start believing that that's been man's problem coming down through time they sit all the way away come on people this endtime people are the only people that's going to get a revelation that what we say is what's going to happen what we say is what's going to happen right the Bible says you say to this mountain right not even the staff the Lord treat this is what I see about your brother Graham said the bride will help us that the Lord and be still well now you have to move through that to me that's a revelation you have to come up through the save the Lord the brother Graham said it wasn't the staff of the Lord when the squirrels were were created there told us that the Lord because when you say just after Lord what you're doing is you're saying what somebody up said Jesus didn't say what somebody else said he said I only say what the father tells me you know a worse day one he didn't have another thought and that's the problem with us we have another thought because of this that's where we have another thought that's why Jeep that's why God had said i will put in with you so if he put the enmity there he's the one that's going to have to bring it back together see that st. didn't put the enmity there I will put enmity so he put the division for redemption right hey now through the need what the word Christ it's all going to come right back together all right and it did on a cross brother I'm said everything was finished at counting everything he said even Israel was saved at Calvary he said but it's not going to be applied to them till we get into the Millennium so you see how long that's going to take it was all done in Calgary for us those three days everything that barrel resurrection is what we're facing death to ourself burial to ourselves and what a resurrection that's the next thing coming is the resurrection dr. buddy change or interaction we got to give them up out of the ground Jesus told Lazarus I like my brother Tim I really enjoy parts of what he said most of what he said but you I said yeah be careful and just watch and you know take what you can take I really like that law of exchange that's really good I enjoyed that the law of exchange tells you a lot that's what we're talking about Jesus exchanged his life to give to put this enmity back together he had to come down and human flesh this hill is on a human being got it this heel was on a human person called through Jesus Christ but he couldn't do it here you couldn't do it here you couldn't do it here you couldn't do it here he couldn't do it here there's a promise had come here what was the promise i will put enmity but i will restore right so in the restoration listen let me let me let me get something full restoration it's not under the Son of God it's the son of god in the Son of Man yeah but the Son of Man is work for restoration this is not this sure who was Jesus gives what something Yeah right the Son of God let's get this today and then we'll make footwear right here the Son of God is a spirit in how the team whatever he wants didn't have it all right if I got that inhabit him whatever he wants to have it so then what we're going to talk about today but with gaga we get off subject but it's still part of its building the foundation son of God is the logos which is the word and prefigure Jesus cried close to the Christ the Anointed I am his the oppening Holy Spirit angel of Covenant now brother Graham said it's the angel of the Covenant that was that angel was inside that burning bush who was it a separate person I was Jesus Christ talking to Moses because remember jesus said before Abraham was well Abraham was before Moses right remember it was Abraham then they got put 400 years in captivity never deliver emotions came so jesus said before ever why he's gift all the way over before Abraham was I am before Abraham don't know where he was telling them whatever happened during that time I was right there and he could if he could put on putting my own words Jesus I know this is what he said many times if I wasn't limited with this woman body takes a lot of things I can do but remember he limited himself to that human body so he could what put it back together he had to put it back together in human flesh you have to put it back together the desert sun god they're worse in purity holy eternal never Santana his life same way with hear hear anything wrong with the Holy Spirit can't they roll that angel coated the captain of the host know what about a man that was so real that Joshua the warrior he was Joshua comes up from a battle one day I'm sure he's all hyped up coming he's he's a natural Orion sure we tied him in spirituality as the holy spirit but he's the next he's a natural warrior he was born but in the land right Moses went mortify the land remember Joshua's want to come over right which is a type of Christ with the Holy Spirit but here's here's a Joshua with his adrenaline flowing and he's coming out of a battle and he walks up and he sees this trans guy standing there they probably don't have on the armor like his or armor like even the end of him he's like who are you I tell i'm at joshua's out who are you what's your name and when he opened his mouth though and told and identified gosh you up I'm the captain of the hope and I've come to take over now what did Joshua do Joshua did just like Moses if you read the Bible wish I could find him I can't find it with this I got a mother regular Bobby but what did he do he bowed down to off his shoes for the ground he was standing on just like Moses mad well see here comes the burning bush where Moses didn't see a man then Moses saw the back part of a man then Joshua the one set to really take over because remember Moses is like the profit that brings you up to the promised land through the right but no prophet says thus saith the Lord he says what God says he says what somebody else tells him to say Joshua when he got into the land he said all right we're going to buy this one this one this one this one you go this way some of you stay here after you try was going to stay here some of you gonna what was Joshua when he was the leader or the Holy Spirit after you get into promised land the probably it brings you to the promised land Joshua takes you in the promised land which Joshua is a type of the one the Holy Spirit but when Joshua comes up and makes a meet the man I believe you become a little bit different it become a little bit different person when you met me kept lose that count of the hope i believe it was God in human flesh he just done the same thing you did with Mel cassadaga he just throat a body together stepped in it and Joshua being a warrior remember God has to meet us sometimes the way we don't the only way we can see right Ezekiel probably when he had that vision memory had a vision of a man he was describing from here to here he was from here to here he call the description but what was the finality one Ezekiel saw will the middle with right so that's his revelation of what Jesus was and then when brother Graham says Jesus goes down to paradise to pick them up and Abraham said hey Sarah that's the one we fetid calf to as he he said is easy i love the way things if you looked over Abraham's children see that's a wheel what was it it was Jesus it was the Opera nygaard standing there the young man that they hadn't met all the way down through here okay so and then the angel the Covenant the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel my brother branham he brings this to the halo over his head and many times in the prayer line he said he's no more than two feet from us right now but he wasn't a man standing there it plugged him he had went back to the hill was the angel the Covenant he said this is the same woman he said it's Jesus Christ will read it next honey well i'll bring the quote from will read them that sunday but he said it's the Angel of the Covenant that letter children to Israel and that struck Paul down see the scene of Revelation now what happens if we got when we get to the Sun man we're going to divide this thing out because the son of man can't come back the little person to the Millennium oh my god that Jesus Christ himself the immortal God cannot walk that's not even what was so wonderful about him on Jesus when my brother Prem saw the vision of Jesus never saw him right he was three to four feet off the ground see that would have broke see if brethren would have saw him standing on the earth I believe that holy spirit inside of him would have said like who was it that through the inkwell and it's saving you know I said the guy walks him with a crown on his head is that I'm Jesus and said the holy spirit inside whoever was Wesley or whoever water no one had Marvin Martin he said they're riding and he looks and you know what most of us would have said old praise god there's Jesus but now something inside of him said hold on hold on a minute there's something wrong about this picture we're supposed to crown you later than this you're not supposed out on your head right now joyfully well lady once they get behind me Satan right same way with all these we must see that that God when he shows his self you have to be careful number one Satan can impersonate and be so close that's what's happening now it's so close yeah but the angel of the Covenant went all that's why I say about some man so the liberal son of man the body of Jesus can't come to the earth until the Millennium okay but that's why that we have to cover some man because the Son of Man is what's right now this is the Son of Man revelation what the God can live in human flesh again like he did in the Garden of Eden it's like you didn't garner be right remember Adam was walking through the garden of eden with a flesh body but he wasn't in trouble yet right when we realize that I think that's what we're going to be changed but here's your we're going to we're going to probably next Sunday jump over into the son of man for a minute but remember excuse me if you look at Ezekiel Ezekiel keep saying son of man prophesied son of man promised up now what's he talking about he's talking about that man because let's just be realized and what's called son of God right he was the only Son of God in the Old Testament right cuz he had what he had the promise and it's all the promise was I'm going to live in you your wife children the juice is 126 is the promise to me that's components this is the redemption promise Genesis 1 26 shows that were the children of God this shows how we're going to get back to that ok give me so the Son of Man revelation is going to be what the Son of God in human flesh now it was the son of God in human flesh in Paul's day right right it was the son of God in human flesh and Paul's name but there was no revelation of the Son of Man even the great Apostle Paul never said a word about its own man okay but they have a revelation that God was living in their heart literally living in their heart but there was things in mound and we will talk about that later on so let's come some God's Spirit God always remember that you
