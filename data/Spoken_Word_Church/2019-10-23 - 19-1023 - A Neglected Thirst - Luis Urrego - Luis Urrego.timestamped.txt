[1:34] Oh
[1:38] I wanted to see
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] amen praise the Lord Jesus a man are you
[1:47] happy to be in the house of God
[1:48] this afternoon amen first and foremost I
[1:52] just want to apologize I'm not wearing a
[1:53] tie I completely slipped my my mind so I
[1:57] do apologize but I have a I have a
[2:01] blazer so uh you forgive me for that and
[2:09] [Laughter]
[2:10] but uh sometimes you know you just get
[2:14] so caught up with what you're gonna
[2:16] preach and then you just kind of forget
[2:17] some of the simple things they meant so
[2:19] so also uh Saints I just wanted to to
[2:25] mention to you all and if you all don't
[2:27] know real quick I wanted to to share
[2:30] with you I don't know if y'all are aware
[2:32] about the podcast that we've been doing
[2:33] lately
[2:34] it's called 10,000 worlds I'm currently
[2:38] about on episode 9 and what a podcast is
[2:41] if you don't know it's kind of like a
[2:42] radio program but it's real it's
[2:45] pre-recorded and it goes directly to
[2:47] your phone to your tablet or to your
[2:49] computer wherever wherever wherever you
[2:52] listen and what what the purpose of the
[2:55] podcast that we're trying to do is we're
[2:57] trying to interview you know Saints get
[3:00] in their testimonies or what God's doing
[3:02] in their lives trying to target our
[3:05] young people even trying to get young
[3:07] people involved to where they can share
[3:09] what God is doing in their lives and
[3:12] last episode that we had we had brother
[3:15] Ron and sister Gabby's testimony and so
[3:18] it was where it was wonderful to sit
[3:19] there in their living room with them and
[3:22] there's just them share about their
[3:24] battle with depression and their battle
[3:26] with suicide and just things like that
[3:28] that they went through and so we have we
[3:32] have a couple of things more lined up
[3:33] with it so if you don't know how to how
[3:36] to deal or work with the podcast I know
[3:38] not everybody knows how to tune in and
[3:41] listen to it you can get with me and I
[3:43] can share that with you so uh I think
[3:46] that'll be a blessing and you just pray
[3:48] for that because I wanna I want us to
[3:51] hear what God is doing in our day
[3:53] amongst people
[3:55] we got so many Christians and so many
[3:57] believers around the world that God is
[3:59] doing great things among and we have no
[4:01] idea what God is doing so that and I
[4:04] think that'll be an encouragement to
[4:05] each and every one of us you know it was
[4:07] great to hear what God did 40 50 years
[4:09] ago that's wonderful we still need those
[4:11] things but what is God doing now amen
[4:13] what is God doing in your life because
[4:15] he's still the same yesterday today and

[10:50] the battles over thrilled by God and be
[10:54] an enemy to him Oh God look into our
[10:58] hearts examine us for the Holy Spirit
[11:01] and let us see this morning if there's
[11:03] any evil thing in it if there is take it
[11:06] away father we now lay it on the altar
[11:08] to walk away and leave it there if it's
[11:11] idleness if it's temper if it's in
[11:15] difference if it's neglecting if it's
[11:18] whatever it may be if it's hatred if
[11:21] it's malice if it's sighs if it's
[11:24] whatever it may be Oh God take it from
[11:28] us and think and this coming revival may
[11:32] we be just so full of your charm Lord
[11:36] until many will come in and be saved
[11:39] the little community here where we tried
[11:42] so hard the first revival nineteen years
[11:44] that I've else now I pray that you'll
[11:47] give us that real real spirit in our
[11:51] heart and may it answer there for
[11:53] eternity
[11:55] granted Lord make us examine ourselves
[11:58] we married people by the way we treat
[12:01] our wives how true we are or how true
[12:04] our lives is to us and maybe we just get
[12:07] in our hearts this morning how we would
[12:09] think of something like that happen in
[12:10] our home and then may we turn our
[12:13] affections towards you say old God be
[12:15] merciful to me Oh if if the wife were
[12:19] just about every once a month just come
[12:21] by and put her hand on yours and say
[12:23] dear I love you and walk on oh how it
[12:26] would seem she was neglecting me how it
[12:30] would seem that something was wrong and
[12:32] God would maybe once a month or once
[12:35] when we go to church we offer a little
[12:37] prayer oh you are our love our communion
[12:42] all the time our thoughts and our
[12:45] intensive our heart will be stayed on
[12:47] being granted Lord Oh keep our heart so
[12:51] said only that the things of the world
[12:53] would become blind and sowing the
[12:55] difference granted Lord here is now I'm
[12:58] blessed in the further part of these
[13:00] services we asked in Christ's name Amen
[13:02] amen
[13:05] there's the Lord I thought that that
[13:07] prayer was such a sincere prayer now I
[13:10] believe that every true Christian Amen
[13:12] that would be the prayer of every true
[13:13] Christian amen the God amen to change
[13:18] our hearts amen and to look to look deep
[13:20] down and what it is Amen that is that is
[13:23] uh causing us and hindering our walk
[13:25] with God amen praise the Lord Jesus so I
[13:29] want us to in light of that Saints I
[13:31] just want us to to read first Timothy
[13:35] second Timothy chapter 3 again in verse
[13:39] 16 the Bible says here as we read but
[13:41] I'm gonna read it from the God's word
[13:43] translation and it says here every
[13:46] scripture passage is inspired by God all
[13:50] of them are useful for teaching pointing
[13:53] out errors correcting people and
[13:55] training them for a life that has God's
[13:58] approval
[14:00] I thoroughly believe Saints that the
[14:02] Word of God amen every passage of the
[14:04] Bible they met wasn't just put there
[14:05] just to be put there there's a purpose
[14:08] behind it amen
[14:09] and that's the reason Saints why we as
[14:11] ministers amen we need to consider about
[14:14] preaching the whole counsel of God amen
[14:17] now just take one little part because we
[14:19] feel comfortable with just this one part
[14:21] amen but you see Saints that we have
[14:23] needs in our in and our congregations we
[14:26] have needs and our within our families
[14:28] we have needs that need to be that need
[14:31] to be addressed and yet sometimes we we
[14:34] for neglect as ministers to find the
[14:37] mind of God to look and say Lord where
[14:39] is it that but people need what is it
[14:41] that the people want what is it that the
[14:43] people what current needs are they have
[14:46] and yet we give them something else and
[14:49] they're they're bleeding and they're
[14:50] there they're there they're hurting and
[14:53] we give something else amen
[14:56] praise the Lord we shouldn't be picky
[14:59] with the Word of God
[15:00] you shouldn't say well I'm gonna take
[15:02] this but not take this no we take the
[15:04] whole Word of God amen
[15:05] because it's the Word of God it's it's
[15:08] it's profitable every scripture passage
[15:10] is inspired by God all of them are
[15:12] useful for teaching pointing out errors
[15:15] correcting people well but we shouldn't
[15:18] correct people I beg your pardon the
[15:20] book the Word of God says different amen
[15:23] the Word of God says that we need to
[15:25] correct people they man because if we
[15:27] don't correct your if you don't correct
[15:29] your child Saints that would be they'll
[15:31] be they'll just those run rampant amen
[15:35] praise the Lord and training them for a
[15:37] life that has God's approval amen do you
[15:40] want your life to have God's approval I
[15:43] want God to look down at me and smile
[15:45] and say and say oh oh son you're doing
[15:48] good and say and say daughter you're
[15:50] doing you're doing good you're trying to
[15:52] do everything you can out of what with
[15:56] what you've got
[15:56] amen to live for me amen I want I want I
[16:00] want that so it's absolutely vital
[16:02] Saints that we a man as ministers amen
[16:07] we we we we we reach out and man and we
[16:10] speak to the families
[16:12] man we we reach out to the children we
[16:14] reach out to the older ones we reach out
[16:16] to the to each and every one because we
[16:18] are all in different levels and we all
[16:21] have different needs in our heart I mean
[16:24] my daughter Bella she's an she's almost
[16:26] 13 years old she has certain needs that
[16:28] I don't have amen
[16:29] she's at an age amen that's critical and
[16:31] if I'm not there to minister to those
[16:33] needs I'm doing her a disservice as a
[16:36] parent you see at that moment a man
[16:41] that's wonderful and I'm the this is no
[16:43] this is no slam against the minister
[16:45] here but at that moment what will Daniel
[16:47] seventy weeks do me when they're hurting
[16:51] no no no I'm not gonna disrespect
[16:54] brother brother wait but at that moment
[16:55] what will what will that do good to me
[17:00] when they're hurting when something's
[17:02] going wrong amen you need they meant to
[17:04] go in and look deeper into the into the
[17:07] into the root cause of things and I'm
[17:10] afraid Saints that a lot of times they
[17:12] meant we fail to do that and we wonder
[17:14] why our church goes a certain direction
[17:16] we wonder why our families go certain
[17:18] direction
[17:18] why why why the why the church amen in
[17:21] the hole is not prospering in the in the
[17:24] in the in in in the Word of God because
[17:27] we neglect amen
[17:29] I'm neglecting that's why I titled this
[17:33] a neglected thirst I neglect to me to to
[17:38] to to address those needs amen that my
[17:41] family may have sure I may be a provider
[17:44] sure I provide food for them sure I put
[17:48] food on the table but that's not enough
[17:49] you as a parent amen if you don't spend
[17:53] time with your children if you don't if
[17:56] you don't if you don't look and see that
[17:59] that that they need they need you they
[18:03] don't need your money they don't need
[18:04] your they don't need your the food they
[18:06] need those things but what they really
[18:08] crave and want is you I'm speaking of
[18:12] the parents now
[18:14] and most of us here probably have had
[18:17] children they want is you I heard his
[18:22] story one time with somebody that was in
[18:24] a in a in a grocery store and he had his
[18:26] little three-year-old boy son with him
[18:29] and and he was walking in the grocery
[18:31] store with him and he said and in the
[18:33] man a man stopped him and he said son
[18:36] sir is that your son and he said yes yes
[18:38] sir he said he said he told him he said
[18:42] you know what love that boy you know
[18:45] what love you know I love that boy he
[18:48] said you know how you spell love TI m ii
[18:54] think about that time and if you we
[19:00] don't spend time with our children if we
[19:03] neglect amen to look at the things that
[19:05] really matter
[19:06] amen because we're so busy caught up
[19:09] with everything else even if it's for
[19:11] the good god has given us people
[19:15] directly under our roof amen that we
[19:17] need to to to to spend time with into
[19:20] and to nurture and to care for amen
[19:22] you'll be responsible and you're the one
[19:25] who's to answer for that amen
[19:27] later on here we're gonna read a story
[19:29] amen that's that that of somebody that
[19:32] that that exact same thing happened to
[19:34] in the bible they match so in 1st
[19:39] Corinthians chapter 10 Paul Paul's here
[19:41] he's speaking to Gentiles amen and he
[19:44] says moreover brethren I would not that
[19:46] ye should be ignorant how they all our
[19:49] fathers say men were under the cloud he
[19:52] meant all the Israelites back then they
[19:54] they went under the cloud they came out
[19:56] of Egypt and I'm just going to try to
[19:58] move as quick as possible they came out
[19:59] of Egypt they were baptized they've
[20:01] crossed over the Red Sea they did all
[20:03] these things under Moses they all per
[20:06] talk of it
[20:08] and yet only two were made it to the
[20:13] promised land out of all those people
[20:16] only two of them made it to the promised
[20:19] land yet they had the message of the
[20:21] hour you see that was the message of the
[20:24] hour they were all baptized in the name
[20:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ so you know
[20:31] they were all they all had these things
[20:34] amen
[20:36] only two were able to make it a man so
[20:39] you could you could be here and you can
[20:41] have all the mysteries and you can have
[20:43] all the doctrine and you can you can you
[20:46] can have everything down to the tee but
[20:49] if you don't have love Paul said you're
[20:51] nothing you could you can you can have
[20:56] every date and you can have everything
[20:58] amen
[20:59] down to the tee but if you don't have
[21:02] love in your heart for one another
[21:03] you're nothing
[21:05] Paul said you're only a sounding brass
[21:07] and a tinkling cymbal and you can't you
[21:11] if you can't really truly from your
[21:13] heart say I love you brother forgive me
[21:16] brother forgive me sister forgive me and
[21:19] you know that you need to something's
[21:23] wrong with you I don't think the love of
[21:25] God is dwelling there and you know what
[21:28] the love of God is when you're born
[21:30] again filled with the Holy Spirit the
[21:33] baptism the Holy Ghost has come upon
[21:34] your soul your that that means that you
[21:37] have full eternal life in your soul that
[21:39] means that you should have all of God in
[21:41] you including love and God is love the
[21:44] Bible says God is truth God is peace I
[21:47] am the way the truth and the life you
[21:48] should have all these things and if that
[21:52] love is not being expressed as we'll
[21:54] read here in just a moment that agape
[21:56] love that love of God
[22:01] and something's wrong you need to
[22:04] reconsider
[22:05] am I really born again do I really I'm
[22:09] not trying to bring doubt saint's I'm
[22:11] just trying to I'm trying to to
[22:13] encourage you because some of us were
[22:16] just walking walking in this life maybe
[22:19] thinking that we have something when in
[22:21] reality we may not just because you go
[22:25] to this church doesn't mean that you're
[22:27] born again just because you can explain
[22:29] Daniel 70 weeks in the seals and all the
[22:31] mysteries down to the T doesn't mean
[22:33] that you're born again you can have it
[22:35] all up here and not have God and you
[22:37] miss God by 10,000 miles when you don't
[22:41] know how to act among among around one
[22:43] another and disrespect one another you
[22:46] you you you make fun of people even from
[22:49] the pulpit calling people names when
[22:53] they disagree with you that's wrong
[22:57] that's not the love of God
[23:04] and they'd all drink the same spiritual
[23:06] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[23:08] rock that followed them and that rock
[23:10] was Christ but with many of them see
[23:13] with many of them God was not well
[23:16] pleased and they were all going through
[23:19] these motions they were all doing
[23:21] everything that Moses told him to do and
[23:23] they were they were obeying the message
[23:25] and God was not well pleased with all of
[23:28] them now verse six of that of that same
[23:33] of 1st Corinthians chapter 10 says now
[23:35] these things were our examples to the
[23:39] intent for the purpose that we should
[23:42] not lust after evil things as they also
[23:44] lusted that's why these things were
[23:47] written in the word amen not just for
[23:50] historical facts and figures amen but
[23:52] there it they were written for us for
[23:54] our example so that we can look and say
[23:56] wow I don't want to do that I don't want
[23:59] to be like that I don't want to make
[24:01] that decision and then and then have to
[24:03] pay for it later
[24:06] thanks God cares about you God cares
[24:08] about your soul whether you're old
[24:09] whether you're young whether you're
[24:11] middle-aged it doesn't matter God is
[24:13] concerned about your life God is
[24:15] concerned where you are right now don't
[24:18] think that God is not he is he loves you
[24:24] and he has a specific word to minister
[24:27] to your specific need at this very
[24:29] moment no matter what age you are praise
[24:33] the Lord
[24:35] if we skip down to verse 11 Paul says
[24:38] here now all these things happened unto
[24:40] them for examples and they are written
[24:43] for our admonition you see the purpose
[24:46] why those things were written for our
[24:48] admonition for us to look and say wow I
[24:51] don't want to do that I don't want to be
[24:53] like that Amen on upon whom the ends of
[24:57] the world come wherefore let him that
[24:59] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[25:04] fall sometimes we think with it we just
[25:10] we feel such a security on us because we
[25:14] come to this church and we throw our
[25:16] Lulla security blanket on us because
[25:18] brother Dale he preaches the word and
[25:20] brother Wade preaches the word and the
[25:21] minister here preaches at work
[25:26] comfortable I know Daniel 70 weeks I got
[25:29] it down to the tea and I get and you
[25:30] don't know how to love your brother
[25:33] that's security blanket no it's not
[25:35] doing you any good you don't know how to
[25:41] treat each other you don't know how you
[25:42] disrespect each other you you you amen I
[25:46] I'll be the one to say I've done that
[25:48] I've been there done that but I want to
[25:50] change I want to change I want i want
[25:54] saints and if the change is going to
[25:55] happen with me so that the rest of the
[25:57] church can change amen then so be it i
[26:00] want that i want to get out of here amen
[26:06] because we fail sometimes to to to to
[26:09] address things at the root level amen
[26:14] and we find ourselves in positions that
[26:16] we shouldn't be a corinthians book of
[26:21] correction brother Branham says here
[26:23] every one of them went into the
[26:24] wilderness jesus said not all that Seth
[26:27] Lord Lord will enter in but the one that
[26:29] doeth the will of my father which is in
[26:31] heaven it isn't what you say you could
[26:34] preach the gospel and still be lost
[26:36] certainly
[26:37] this is not just little kids stuff
[26:40] brother Branham says this is absolutely
[26:43] it's deep we we need we need the the
[26:52] major doctrines of the Bible we need
[26:54] those things I'm not discrediting now
[26:56] I'm not I'm not that's not what I'm
[26:57] trying to do we need those things
[26:59] we appreciate the things that we that we
[27:02] hear in our church but but the brown
[27:06] said I hear these things live in a good
[27:08] Christian life living a Christian life
[27:10] and knowing how to treat one another
[27:11] that's deep and it's much smoked some
[27:17] some of us we don't know how to do that
[27:19] and yet we've been in the message for 40
[27:21] years you don't you don't know how to
[27:26] treat each other I don't know maybe I'm
[27:29] overstepping my boundaries I hope not
[27:31] I'm just trying to encourage you Saints
[27:35] and Christianity is not just to be just
[27:38] a little light fabulous thing like well
[27:40] I'll go over to church and I know it's
[27:42] just it's my duty to go that's not
[27:45] Christianity just because you're here
[27:49] and you're warming up you that's not
[27:50] Christianity that's not it's something
[27:57] that God has done see you can't do it
[28:00] God has to do it God has chosen you in
[28:02] Christ and presented you as a love gift
[28:05] to Christ and if God's calling election
[28:08] and if we have the opportunity to become
[28:09] that type of person and turn it down for
[28:12] little old things of the world
[28:16] Brandon continues in that same message
[28:18] but brother it's a lot more than
[28:20] intellectuals we need good teaching
[28:26] again don't get me wrong we need
[28:28] teaching we need we need the fivefold
[28:30] ministry but just because you can
[28:33] explain the things of the Bible doesn't
[28:35] mean you're born again you could just
[28:39] have a security blanket on you
[28:44] it goes to a genuine birth not just a
[28:47] mental conception or an emotional work
[28:49] but but a birth and experience something
[28:53] that goes plumb down deep into the heart
[28:55] and change in the inter inner most
[28:59] seeing that prayer that brother Branham
[29:01] was talking about constantly mentioned
[29:03] in the heart the heart Lord changed my
[29:06] heart amen
[29:07] because Saints we can have the baptism
[29:10] of the Holy Ghost in our soul but we
[29:12] still that's the reason why we need the
[29:14] the statue of a perfect man because we
[29:16] still wrestle with our spirit amen we
[29:19] still wrestle with with with with a the
[29:23] five senses the five senses of the of
[29:25] the spirit realm come to me again by the
[29:28] way memory reason conscious affection
[29:31] and imagination the the new birth in
[29:36] your soul doesn't change those those
[29:38] things that's the reason why we need a
[29:40] man the statute statue of a perfect man
[29:44] amen serene so it's a constant battle
[29:48] day by day in the Notre for and if and
[29:51] if we are working in the spirit man then
[29:53] it's gonna manifest in the in the flesh
[29:55] man amen
[29:57] Jesus said whatever is in your heart
[29:59] that's what you're going to portray a
[30:02] man out of the abundance of the heart
[30:04] speaks the mouth don't tell me that
[30:09] you're Christian amen don't tell me that
[30:12] you're a Christian and you're talking
[30:14] dirty all the time yeah that just tells
[30:18] me one thing that's what you feed on
[30:20] don't tell me that you're a Christian
[30:23] and you're constantly looking at people
[30:24] hating hateful resentful bitter that's
[30:31] what you feed on
[30:37] a man that makes you do things that you
[30:44] would not have done other words
[30:45] otherwise it makes you love those who
[30:48] are unlovable makes you act different
[30:50] than you ever thought that you would act
[30:52] and when situations arise it's your
[30:55] anchor Amen no matter what it is in the
[31:01] home in the church no matter what
[31:02] situation it is if it arises Amen if you
[31:05] have that Amen in your and your
[31:06] innermost in your soul Amen that
[31:09] expresses through the spirit man and out
[31:11] through the flesh man and man that's
[31:13] your anchor that's this love amen
[31:17] that's the reason why if you have love
[31:19] in your soul which is God is love right
[31:22] the scripture says that then it should
[31:24] be reflecting amen showing forth through
[31:26] your spirit man and out your it's your
[31:29] flesh man but if it's not then what are
[31:34] we supposed to conclude think about that
[31:39] Saints you could just be in a
[31:41] justification or sanctification a state
[31:44] and you can explain all these mysteries
[31:49] and yet died this tonight without the
[31:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[32:01] if we go back and read 1st Corinthians
[32:04] chapter or this is this is a new
[32:05] scripture 1st Corinthians chapter 13
[32:08] let's read from verses 1 through 3 I
[32:11] want to read from the good news
[32:12] translation because it has more impact
[32:14] they men and all of you are know this
[32:19] scripture I may be able to speak the
[32:21] languages of human beings and even of
[32:23] angels but if I have no love my speech
[32:27] is no more than a noisy gong or a
[32:29] clanging Bell I may have the gift of
[32:34] inspired preaching I may have all
[32:37] knowledge all knowledge and understand
[32:41] all secrets whether in life or in the
[32:45] word I may have all the faith needed to
[32:49] move mountains
[32:52] but if I have no love Paul says I am
[32:55] nothing that's pretty strong because see
[33:01] sometimes we base our life and we base
[33:03] we base our experience that that we on
[33:07] the externals that because we do this or
[33:10] we know this or or we come to lula we
[33:13] we've got it that doesn't mean that a
[33:17] man I'm a give away everything I have
[33:21] and even give up my body to be burned
[33:23] but if I have no love this does me no
[33:25] good and when you go back and look at
[33:31] what that word love there that's the
[33:33] word agape that's not a filial love that
[33:37] Paul was talking about that's the love
[33:39] of God so if you have no love the love
[33:43] of God in you and you can explain Daniel
[33:46] so many weeks everything every every
[33:49] everything and you can explain the seven
[33:51] seals and you can just you can explain
[33:54] everything down to the T and there's no
[33:58] love in your heart either means one of
[34:01] two one of three things you're either in
[34:03] a justified state or in a sanctified
[34:05] state or you don't have anything at all
[34:11] you're an unbeliever or you just have it
[34:17] up here but it hasn't come down here
[34:20] that you can mean that's the only three
[34:23] things that that can mean think on this
[34:27] thing Saints where are you brother
[34:31] Brandon preach the message called amen
[34:33] thinking on your ways
[34:34] you know something on that line as I
[34:37] thought on my way think on your think on
[34:40] your life am I here at church just
[34:43] because just because it's a tradition
[34:46] because I'm supposed to come by man well
[34:49] what is the purpose of me living a
[34:51] Christian life well am i impacting other
[34:56] people spiritually what what are you
[34:59] doing that's impacting people
[35:00] spiritually and sometimes we get
[35:02] criticized amen
[35:03] for doing something for God and doing
[35:05] something - for God and I'll ask you
[35:07] what are you doing what are you doing
[35:12] for God that's impacting your children
[35:14] that's impacting your your husband your
[35:16] wife your your pastor your your church
[35:19] amen you the people are here what do
[35:21] they see or do they see just formality
[35:25] and in tradition that's no different in
[35:28] a Catholic Church we may not have
[35:31] statues here but we sure make we can
[35:34] make this a Catholic Church a
[35:36] denomination word can't be denominated
[35:40] this message can't be demand mated but
[35:42] in your heart and your mind it can be by
[35:45] the way you look at it first Corinthians
[35:50] chapter 13 verse 4 3:11 continues here
[35:54] love is patient and then the good news
[35:56] translation love is patient it is not
[35:58] jealous or conceited or proud ah love is
[36:04] not ill-mannered or selfish or irritable
[36:08] love does not keep a record of wrongs
[36:17] love is not happy with evil but is happy
[36:21] with the truth I want the truth amen
[36:27] give me I want the truth let me do
[36:29] whatever I can to get to the truth amen
[36:33] love never gives up and it's faith hope
[36:37] and patience never fail love is eternal
[36:42] because this is the love of God right
[36:44] there are inspired messages but they are
[36:47] temporary there are gifts of speaking in
[36:50] strange tongues but they will cease
[36:52] there is knowledge but it will pass and
[36:56] skip down to verse 11 when I was a child
[37:00] my speech feelings and thinking were all
[37:02] those of a child now that I am an adult
[37:06] I have no more use for childish ways
[37:11] some of us here adults and still act
[37:14] like children spiritually
[37:17] I put myself in there as well we should
[37:25] be we should be eating the heavy things
[37:28] of God and letting those heavy things of
[37:30] God to strong meat amen
[37:33] changing us from the inside out but
[37:36] sometimes some of us are even still
[37:38] questioning to this day whether you have
[37:40] the Holy Ghost or not and you've been
[37:43] coming to this church for 40 years and
[37:44] you've been you you listen to the
[37:47] message for 40 50 years and you still
[37:49] don't know if you've got the Holy Ghost
[37:51] I'm challenging you Saints it's a late
[37:54] hour for us to just be playing church
[37:58] amen
[38:00] this is maybe not not what you came to
[38:02] hear amen ah but it's the Word of God am
[38:05] I not preaching the Word of God is the
[38:08] word you get mad at the word don't get
[38:11] mad at me Amen praise the Lord so I'm
[38:24] just gonna skip down some of these
[38:25] things amen I mean so if your own soul
[38:30] hasn't been sealed by the baptism of the
[38:33] Holy Ghost I meant in order to display
[38:35] this love what does it matter that you
[38:38] know all these mysteries what what does
[38:43] it matter
[38:47] amen we
[38:54] you know and we say phrases like people
[38:57] in this message the people in this
[39:00] message they they're you know what
[39:02] you're doing when you do that
[39:04] you're throwing seeds of dissension in
[39:06] people's minds because I believe people
[39:12] out there want the same heaven that you
[39:15] and I do they may not be in the same
[39:20] place where you are they may not be in
[39:22] the same spot or or have the same
[39:24] revelation that you are are but they're
[39:25] striving I would rather be at a place
[39:27] where it's full of love then than to
[39:30] have no love whatsoever and yet know all
[39:33] these mysteries down to a team why do we
[39:42] do that that that's not the love that
[39:46] Paul was talking about we're doing the
[39:49] congregation of the service amen
[39:57] thanks it's it's it's it's it's like
[40:01] brother branham's talked about when he
[40:02] talked about that eagle the eagles nest
[40:03] amen and he made it and he made it and
[40:06] the eagle made it all comfortable and
[40:08] and in in in all all of the eaglets
[40:14] there were all comfortable but it came a
[40:17] time Saints they came a time that they
[40:20] needed to go fly they needed to go fly
[40:24] on their own you need their car has to
[40:27] come a point in time that you need to
[40:28] know these things for your own
[40:30] amen there's not enough that the
[40:33] ministry knows that amen you do how are
[40:36] these things you know them and how are
[40:38] they impacting you are they changing you
[40:42] from the inside out and are they causing
[40:44] change in other people affecting other
[40:48] people I mean because
[40:55] I'm saying we need we need to say these
[40:57] things we need to say these things
[41:00] sometimes because sometimes we like our
[41:02] comfort zones I didn't come here to make
[41:04] you comfortable tonight I didn't come
[41:08] here I'm not gonna be silent to make you
[41:10] comfortable get on that security blanket
[41:13] again cozy no something-something the
[41:19] mother ego at one point in time lips
[41:21] that that skin off the nest and say it's
[41:24] not for you bow to all to fly that's
[41:27] what I'm saying to you tonight Saints
[41:28] it's time for us to fly amen it's time
[41:31] for us to get out of here
[41:33] praise God little things a man come off
[41:37] amen and we're all childish about it
[41:40] it's time for us to fly because Saints
[41:47] you know when it came time to rebuke bad
[41:49] behavior Paul rebuked bad behavior and
[41:53] he gave a reason for it when it came
[41:56] time to deal with the husband and it
[41:57] came time to deal with the wife Paul
[41:59] dealt with those things Paul dealt with
[42:01] children no with the children part dealt
[42:04] with the home life Paul dealt with with
[42:06] the with ministry Paul dealt with all
[42:08] these items a man in the Bible and so
[42:10] did brother branham praise God
[42:19] amen and if if we ministers amen if if
[42:23] we choose Amen to be silent about these
[42:25] things and our silent our silences is
[42:29] the bullet that that's gonna kill the
[42:31] congregation No
[42:36] praise God and sometimes we're afraid
[42:41] Amen to to to look at these things
[42:43] because we don't like conflict we don't
[42:47] like we don't like a conflict we like
[42:51] things so easy and we like we like
[42:53] things just a microwave fix and move on
[42:58] then don't tell me that's not how things
[43:00] are and you know what that's gonna cause
[43:05] you problems in the long run you know
[43:07] what that's called that's called
[43:08] sweeping things under the rug problems
[43:14] keep coming up same problem sweeping it
[43:18] under the rug before you know it that
[43:21] thing is gonna be piled up over here and
[43:24] everything that you had on there there
[43:26] is what's causing in your houses is
[43:28] gonna cave in you're tripping over the
[43:31] rug because you fail to - they'll deal
[43:36] with things at the root level do you
[43:38] want to hear about a story about
[43:40] somebody in the Bible that then deal
[43:42] with things in the root level and what
[43:45] it caused them it's in the Bible and
[43:48] there's quite a few examples in the
[43:50] Bible but this is the this one right
[43:52] here is the one that catches my
[43:53] attention more and I want all parents to
[43:58] listen listen to this because this was a
[44:02] father a father who neglected amen his
[44:07] his family his his who was a king we're
[44:13] talking about David here he had all he
[44:18] had six sons the first six sons that he
[44:20] had one of them being Absalon he was the
[44:23] third one the first one was aim aim and
[44:30] Mammon or something
[44:32] like that can't remember I'll go back in
[44:33] here in just a moment so you you read
[44:38] that he had these sons in First Samuel
[44:40] Chapter First Samuel Chapter three
[44:43] and he had these six sons and then
[44:46] there's no mention again of these sons
[44:48] until Samuel chapter 13 and all this
[44:53] time David was busy being your king he
[44:58] was busy building the city fighting wars
[45:02] busy with with with the responsibilities
[45:06] of being a king and forgetting that he
[45:08] had wives and concubines and children at
[45:11] his house that needed him they he was he
[45:21] was busy and sometimes Saint says his
[45:24] parents we're just too busy that's why I
[45:28] said earlier today Oh Waldo we're just
[45:31] too busy to do the things amen spend
[45:34] time with our children to spend time
[45:36] with our wives to spend time with our
[45:38] husbands amen to do those little thing
[45:41] you say myself it doesn't matter you
[45:43] know they'll be fun oh I beg your pardon
[45:46] it matters a lot whole lot some of you
[45:50] probably have experienced that it and
[45:53] you see the effects of not doing that
[46:01] and you know if you want if you want a
[46:03] book of if you want to read soap operas
[46:06] or drama just read the books of first
[46:09] samuel second samuel first king second
[46:12] kings that right there is the most soap
[46:14] operas that you can have you don't need
[46:16] days of our lives you don't need nothing
[46:17] i don't know what soap operas are out
[46:19] there now but you don't need know that
[46:20] you think you just read those lives if
[46:22] you want you want to see stories of
[46:24] raping and and and and in murder and
[46:27] deceit and all these things you just we
[46:30] go back and read those books it's there
[46:32] but remember what paul said they're
[46:35] there for our example they're not just
[46:38] so to inform ourselves they men they're
[46:40] there for us to look and say wow i i
[46:43] don't want that in my life i want that
[46:47] in my life amen so david's time was was
[46:52] spread so thin amen because of of his
[46:55] multiple wives and concubines and
[46:57] children amen
[46:58] but david even though he was a wonderful
[47:00] king did what he was supposed to do and
[47:03] love god we know he's and we know that
[47:05] we love we see that he loved god yeah he
[47:09] was an absent father through all of his
[47:16] sons but especially to Absalon and
[47:19] sometimes we we don't we felt in the we
[47:22] neglect amen
[47:23] how do we balance the life work in our
[47:27] lives you know but there's got to be a
[47:29] balance god gave you those children for
[47:34] you to just constantly be working all
[47:35] the time constantly be working out of
[47:37] town and neglecting those children amen
[47:38] that's that's a disservice to them they
[47:42] need you amen
[47:49] because children's needs as I said
[47:51] earlier they they go way beyond were you
[47:54] providing food at the table they they go
[48:00] way beyond that just because you provide
[48:02] for them food on table or give them some
[48:04] money from time to time or whatever that
[48:06] does not mean that they have your heart
[48:08] that you have yet that you have their
[48:10] heart I want my children's heart I want
[48:13] my daughter's heart amen first of all
[48:15] want their God to have their heart amen
[48:17] but I want them to be so comfortable
[48:19] with me I want them to to be able to
[48:21] come to me whenever they have issues
[48:23] come to my wife whenever they have the
[48:25] first people they come to is to come
[48:27] come to us they can they can be so
[48:31] comfortable coming to you because they
[48:33] know that you're not going to treat send
[48:36] them away they know that you're not
[48:37] going to just kick them out the door and
[48:40] just amen I want that for my children
[48:46] and I don't know of any parent that
[48:49] doesn't I don't know of any parent that
[48:52] doesn't and so and so Saints the little
[48:57] things that we neglect become bigger
[49:00] things we keep sweeping things under the
[49:03] rug because we think in our mind that
[49:06] it's not important you're gonna realize
[49:08] one day that you've made a mountain out
[49:11] of something that you could have stopped
[49:15] there's a nursery rhyme that that I
[49:18] found then you you've all may have may
[49:20] have heard it if the brothers can bring
[49:21] it up for want of a nail the shoe was
[49:28] lost for want of a shoe the horse was
[49:32] lost for want of a horse the rider was
[49:35] lost for want of a writer the message
[49:39] was lost for want of a message the
[49:43] battle was lost for want of a battle the
[49:46] kingdom was lost and Oh for the want of
[49:50] a horseshoe now just let that sink in
[49:57] all because you've you failed to fix the
[50:02] little things that came
[50:03] up in your life oh it's not important
[50:08] it's okay time will heal things now time
[50:14] doesn't heal things and we keep that
[50:17] mentality up we're not gonna get
[50:19] anywhere people are hurting people
[50:23] people people need closure and yet we
[50:26] still keep that mentality in our hearts
[50:29] that's gonna be the downfall of your
[50:32] family is gonna be the downfall of this
[50:33] church it's gonna be the downfall of
[50:35] anybody that keeps that mentality in
[50:37] their heart but David's inconsistent
[50:43] life amen
[50:44] and Absalon he experienced his dad's
[50:47] neglect well everybody was praising him
[50:50] and everybody was saying oh how great
[50:52] David was he killed his his mighty man
[50:55] all these all these great things look at
[50:57] the great big cities that he that he
[50:59] built and all these wonderful things
[51:01] that he said about that the people were
[51:03] saying about David and yet they didn't
[51:05] know what was going on behind David's
[51:07] family life and Absalon saw this this
[51:12] whole time watching his dad my dad
[51:16] doesn't want to play ball with me okay
[51:20] next day comes dad
[51:22] can we sit down and pray son go ahead go
[51:27] ahead and pray on your own I'll do it
[51:29] with you tomorrow I'll read you that
[51:31] story tomorrow okay 10 years later
[51:37] dad can you come let's do this together
[51:40] let's go hunting together
[51:42] son I've got I've got I've got this war
[51:46] I got a fight I got this battle I've got
[51:48] a I've got a you know I can't do it
[51:51] today okay dad
[51:57] can we go do this that or the other I
[52:00] see that you're not doing anything
[52:02] you're just up on the roof what are you
[52:04] doing up on the roof looking at what not
[52:11] known at that moment David was sinning
[52:13] what are you doing and all this
[52:18] Absalon had in his heart in his mind and
[52:21] probably all his other children too I'm
[52:26] challenging parents life it can get in
[52:30] the way but there's something that we
[52:31] can stop it right now you don't have to
[52:34] go that you don't have you are
[52:35] responsible for your children unto a
[52:37] certain point at that point a man that
[52:39] then you just give him over to God but
[52:44] where are their Holy Ghost up to a
[52:46] certain point I like one thing that
[52:50] brother Joe told me one time he said I
[52:52] am NOT going to fail I'm not going to
[52:55] fail to do the things and do things that
[52:58] with my children that are that will
[53:00] benefit them amen and one day they go
[53:04] and tell me dad you didn't do nothing
[53:06] with me you didn't you need to do this
[53:08] amen that that stayed with me as we
[53:13] criticize amen because we were out too
[53:15] much doing things for the young people
[53:17] and in camps and things like that
[53:19] you know what Saints you do not know
[53:22] that a seed can be planted at that
[53:24] particular camp that will have give them
[53:26] the new birth at it but at some point in
[53:27] time the Word of God is being preached
[53:33] other people probably saying oh I'm so
[53:36] on you're so lucky you have your dad as
[53:38] the as the king and so lucky that your
[53:42] dad and Absalom is probably you know
[53:45] what yeah but you just don't know I my
[53:49] dad may be your king but he's not my dad
[53:53] remember what we're talking about the
[53:55] neglected thirst so
[54:00] I don't know Saints if you all have gone
[54:04] through experiences of maybe finding
[54:07] that your maybe your parents living
[54:09] double lives and things like that I'd
[54:11] you know I thank God I never had to go
[54:13] through something like that but you know
[54:16] what Absalon had to go through that they
[54:19] found out that his dad was was living a
[54:22] double life committing adultery with
[54:24] Bathsheba what do you think how do you
[54:26] think he felt what do you think went
[54:29] through his mind you see and and since
[54:38] there is nothing that's gonna persuade
[54:41] your children more than the life that
[54:44] you live before them if what comes out
[54:48] of your mouth is what you do that is
[54:51] going to persuade them more than any
[54:53] money that you can give them here you go
[54:55] through some money you go on ahead now
[54:58] it's okay here's some candy that's gonna
[55:02] that's gonna persuade them more then any
[55:05] anything here's some food here's some
[55:07] food son hey hey look you know there's
[55:12] gonna cause me more reaction from them
[55:15] to be want to be I want what mom and dad
[55:17] have then just Patchen kind of things up
[55:22] and here you go here here's a tablet
[55:25] here is the iPhone are you even thinking
[55:30] that you might be doing damage to your
[55:32] children by doing those things does they
[55:36] even go through your head that you might
[55:38] be doing that and then when your
[55:40] children are out in the world and and
[55:43] and come home with things you never
[55:46] thought they would come home with then
[55:50] you wonder wonder feel is my fault
[55:54] as we see it same children that grew up
[55:58] in church
[56:04] I'm not gonna say here and say guarantee
[56:06] that my children won't go and do things
[56:09] that they're not supposed to do I'll be
[56:11] the first one to say that but I sure am
[56:15] gonna do everything I can to cause it to
[56:17] right now to cause to make sure they
[56:19] don't go those ways and to sow something
[56:23] then in their heart they men they will
[56:25] make them think on their ways when
[56:26] they're getting ready to do something
[56:27] they're not supposed to do but sometimes
[56:32] what we do is just give them a phone or
[56:34] give them a tablet we go do our own
[56:38] thing I like it that it's quiet because
[56:43] you're listening to me
[56:44] and I hope that you're thinking on your
[56:46] ways amen when a child sees that they're
[56:51] serving and giving and forgiveness and
[56:55] reconciling and worshiping in the home
[56:57] and hospitality amen they're gonna pick
[57:00] up those things and they're gonna learn
[57:01] and grow up amen
[57:03] with those things but when a child sees
[57:06] fighting cheating lying no self-control
[57:11] hypocrisy jealousy that's what do you
[57:17] think your child is gonna learn it's the
[57:24] simple law of reaping what you sow don't
[57:27] get upset at your child because he's
[57:28] acting just like you so later on after
[57:37] when we see when we see that Absalon he
[57:39] was he was mentioned in in fir in 2nd
[57:42] samuel chapter 3 and then it's not he's
[57:46] not mentioned again until 2nd samuel
[57:47] chapter 13 and it was in that story
[57:50] where am ninh david's oldest son raped
[57:59] his half-sister as horrible as that
[58:03] looks and as horrible as it is it's
[58:06] written in the Bible it says it's in the
[58:10] Bible that's the reason why I started
[58:11] off with the scripture that all
[58:13] Scripture is given to us for examples
[58:17] for correction
[58:17] for us to look at and learn from so here
[58:20] is is and I'm not gonna go through all
[58:22] the details of that you can read it in
[58:24] second Samuel chapter 13 but at the end
[58:26] amen I want I want I want to read this
[58:29] the brothers can pull up second Samuel
[58:31] 13 verses 19 through 22 Tamar is David's
[58:37] a daughter and damar put ashes on her
[58:42] head after the the incident had happened
[58:44] after a man had raped her her own
[58:47] half-brother and rent her garment of
[58:50] divers colours that was on her and laid
[58:52] her hand on her head and went on crying
[58:55] and Absalon her brother said unto her
[58:58] have em ninh die brother been with thee
[59:01] but hold now thy peace my sister he is
[59:05] thy brother regard not this thing in
[59:07] other words let's keep peaceful about
[59:10] this just just for a little bit so tame
[59:13] are remain desolate in her brother
[59:15] absalon's house where she was a a
[59:19] wretched woman in absalon's house
[59:22] because her her virtue had been taken
[59:25] away by her own family member but when
[59:30] King David heard all these things he was
[59:33] very wroth in other words he was very
[59:36] angry in other versions of the Bible the
[59:39] Bible says that he was very angry but
[59:41] did not punish em then we don't see
[59:47] anywhere in the Bible where he punishes
[59:49] Amnon for what he did that's a terrible
[59:54] sin don't you think that's horrible but
[59:59] David being the king who had power to
[1:00:02] say and to decree and things as such
[1:00:05] does not do anything about it so guess
[1:00:10] what happens
[1:00:14] Absalon starts built in a complex and
[1:00:18] starts building the hate towards his
[1:00:19] father first of all to M Ninh his
[1:00:22] brother because of his of what he did to
[1:00:26] his his sister and then towards his dad
[1:00:30] because his dad didn't do anything about
[1:00:32] it I want us to look at our our family
[1:00:38] life Saints are we correcting our
[1:00:43] children are we telling them you're
[1:00:46] wrong you're wrong for doing that
[1:00:51] or we just kind of just sweeping it
[1:00:53] under the rug just because they're our
[1:00:56] own children we don't want the public to
[1:01:00] see and we don't want the church to know
[1:01:01] that our children did such-and-such do
[1:01:05] you know what you know what happens when
[1:01:07] you do that and you lie and you try to
[1:01:09] cover up things in your life and stuff
[1:01:11] like that you're losing you're damaging
[1:01:14] your own integrity you're damaging your
[1:01:20] own integrity if the ministry does that
[1:01:22] in a church we're damaging their
[1:01:23] integrity here if you as a family man as
[1:01:28] a husband as a wife if you do that
[1:01:29] covering up for your children and things
[1:01:31] like that and not acknowledging that you
[1:01:34] are wrong and you're and you're and you
[1:01:36] did it and you and and and and try to
[1:01:38] make things right then you're losing
[1:01:40] integrity goes a long way now nobody can
[1:01:44] trust you anymore
[1:01:46] David got to this point with his
[1:01:48] children and absalon's eyes because in
[1:01:51] those days in those days if you rape the
[1:01:54] woman and think you were supposed to
[1:01:57] provide for her you see or else you were
[1:02:03] gonna get killed so what was the reason
[1:02:05] why David didn't do what didn't didn't
[1:02:08] punish his own son whether in private or
[1:02:12] in public maybe maybe he was thinking
[1:02:15] about his his his is that M Ninh was his
[1:02:18] firstborn so he was next in line to be a
[1:02:20] king I needn't want to do anything to
[1:02:23] damage that dynasty that he was trying
[1:02:25] to build maybe the
[1:02:27] was the purpose I don't know but was it
[1:02:31] right was it right that his sister that
[1:02:36] that his own daughter was was violated
[1:02:40] by his own son and nothing was said
[1:02:42] about it oh I got it mad about it that's
[1:02:48] not doing anything about it that's not
[1:02:51] going in and and pulling out the scabs
[1:02:54] and going into that cancerous area and
[1:02:56] and cleaning that that infection that
[1:02:59] that that does nothing going down deep
[1:03:03] into the root of the matter why because
[1:03:06] I don't have time I don't have time to
[1:03:08] deal with it I don't want conflict I
[1:03:10] don't want to why are we so neglectful
[1:03:22] the men are as leaders of our home as
[1:03:25] parents absolutely we as leaders of the
[1:03:29] church we need to tell the truth whether
[1:03:31] it hurts you or not God knows if you
[1:03:37] didn't or not God one day will will will
[1:03:41] be the one - and your children are
[1:03:47] watching and listening
[1:03:53] whatever goes around comes around and
[1:03:56] some of us have probably already
[1:03:58] experienced those things I have
[1:04:03] sometimes sometimes my my daughter's
[1:04:06] maybe act in a certain way or did
[1:04:07] something or doing something on my
[1:04:09] window where did they get that from oh
[1:04:16] they saw me doing that just a few years
[1:04:19] ago I allowed that in my home I allowed
[1:04:23] that music in my home I allowed that
[1:04:25] thing in my home and you can't get mad
[1:04:28] at them now you have to go in and fix
[1:04:33] the thing at the root level and tell
[1:04:35] them why listen sweetheart listen baby
[1:04:38] I'm we don't allow this in our home this
[1:04:42] is the reason why I know that you saw me
[1:04:44] doing it I know that you saw this that
[1:04:46] or the other I'm sorry and I should not
[1:04:48] have done it we don't allow it in our
[1:04:49] home for this this this reason be
[1:04:52] willing to get down and humble yourself
[1:04:55] and say I'm sorry but as parents we
[1:04:59] don't want to do that we're too proud
[1:05:07] the moment that you start covering up
[1:05:09] and telling lies your integrity goes
[1:05:13] down the toilet amen so David didn't do
[1:05:21] anything in order to preserve his
[1:05:24] kingdom but that choice was what started
[1:05:27] the process of destroying what he wanted
[1:05:30] to preserve so we we keep going and uh
[1:05:36] if actually if the brothers could bring
[1:05:39] bring up how to raise a delinquent I
[1:05:46] found this online how to raise a
[1:05:51] delinquent
[1:05:52] now remember brother branham said that
[1:05:54] it's not child delinquency as parent
[1:05:56] delinquency he said that a lot of time
[1:06:00] began in infancy to give your child
[1:06:03] whatever he or she wants then they will
[1:06:06] believe they were
[1:06:07] - owes them a living step1 step2
[1:06:13] when they pick up Boulder words laugh at
[1:06:16] them this will make them think they are
[1:06:18] cute step3
[1:06:22] how to raise a delinquent never give
[1:06:25] your child spiritual training wait until
[1:06:29] they are 21 then let them decide for
[1:06:31] themselves step 4
[1:06:36] we're getting there we'll have a
[1:06:39] full-fledged little delinquent here in
[1:06:41] just just any moment now avoid the use
[1:06:45] of the words wrong or sin these words
[1:06:48] may cause them to develop a guilt
[1:06:50] complex
[1:06:53] this will condition your child to
[1:06:55] believe later when he or she is arrested
[1:06:57] that society is against them and they
[1:07:00] are being persecuted step 5 we almost
[1:07:07] got him defend your child against
[1:07:10] neighbors teachers police officer or any
[1:07:14] authority and bail them out out of any
[1:07:16] problem they get into with the law
[1:07:19] they're all against your child you know
[1:07:21] and that's how you build how you raise a
[1:07:26] delinquent ask yourself is that what I'm
[1:07:32] doing
[1:07:39] so we see that david here he was an
[1:07:41] absent father he led an inconsistent
[1:07:45] life right he was a neglectful
[1:07:51] disciplinarian didn't discipline it when
[1:07:54] he needed to and finally he caused an
[1:07:59] incomplete reconciliation in other words
[1:08:06] he just brushed it under the rug and
[1:08:10] said and Absalon is is here a boiling
[1:08:14] cauldron of bitterness and he's not seen
[1:08:18] none of that in his son and so what
[1:08:22] happens is in in second samuel chapter
[1:08:24] 13 verse 22 dan Absalon spake unto his
[1:08:27] brother and then neither good nor bad in
[1:08:30] other words from that day forward he
[1:08:31] didn't want to speak to his brother
[1:08:32] anymore david should have caught on that
[1:08:38] now believe if David would have done
[1:08:40] something about what Ammon did they
[1:08:42] wouldn't have led Epsilon to come to
[1:08:44] this point for Absalon hated Emin
[1:08:50] because he had forced his sister Tamar
[1:08:53] so guess what happens Absalon takes
[1:08:56] matters into his own hands so he kills
[1:08:59] he has Amnon killed and then flees and
[1:09:03] we read in the Bible that David is
[1:09:05] crying for his son Adnan rightly so
[1:09:09] he's cry for his son Amnon but then he
[1:09:11] gets over a man and he's crying for his
[1:09:14] son Absalom because his son epsilon is
[1:09:17] gone from his presence for three years
[1:09:19] doesn't know anything about about him
[1:09:22] and all because of a choice that he made
[1:09:25] that David me amen
[1:09:29] but Absalom fled and went to tell my the
[1:09:31] son of mu
[1:09:32] king of Gesher and David mourn for his
[1:09:34] son every day so Absalom fled and went
[1:09:38] to get sure and went there three years
[1:09:39] and the soul of King David longed to go
[1:09:41] forth unto Absalon for he was comforted
[1:09:43] concerning Amnon seeing he was dead
[1:09:46] Dave David longed to see his son Absalom
[1:09:51] amen because you see saints David was
[1:09:54] the one responsible a meant to to start
[1:09:57] that reconciliation process he was the
[1:10:02] king he was the father he was the one
[1:10:05] who would to initiate that process but
[1:10:08] he didn't do anything about it and what
[1:10:13] and we as the parents say man we don't
[1:10:15] want to need if we are we're the ones
[1:10:18] that have been given Authority we're the
[1:10:20] ones that have been given more maturity
[1:10:22] than R then R than our children and then
[1:10:24] we're the ones who are responsible they
[1:10:26] meant to start that process of
[1:10:28] reconciliation if your son and daughter
[1:10:32] did something or if you or if somebody
[1:10:34] did something to you it meant you be the
[1:10:36] mature one to go start that
[1:10:37] reconciliation process oh no I'm gonna
[1:10:39] wait till they come to me that's not
[1:10:41] what this Bible says so jesus said
[1:10:45] himself if you've done oh if you have
[1:10:48] out against somebody a man go make that
[1:10:49] right but if you also know that there's
[1:10:52] up in that person's heart towards you
[1:10:54] you going to that person isn't that what
[1:10:58] the Bible says and why do we sit around
[1:11:00] waiting and our church is dying and
[1:11:06] things are happening and we're wondering
[1:11:11] what in the world is going on in our in
[1:11:17] our in our family's life in our social
[1:11:20] life and in the church everything and
[1:11:22] you could be the root cause I heard
[1:11:25] brother Branham tell a story of the
[1:11:28] other day he had a little boy come to
[1:11:31] him and on a prayer line he was he was
[1:11:33] being possessed and the boy was telling
[1:11:37] him was : brother the same brother
[1:11:38] branham you have it you have it william
[1:11:40] branham you have nothing against me it
[1:11:41] was the demons talking through him and
[1:11:44] brother Brown said come to find out what
[1:11:46] it was it was something that his dad had
[1:11:49] done that that was the reason why that
[1:11:52] boy was like that so sometimes it's not
[1:11:56] just your children's fault your children
[1:12:00] are looking at you and building
[1:12:02] complexes in their life and looking ends
[1:12:05] okay mom has this or dad has this oh
[1:12:07] okay well this is what I'm gonna do and
[1:12:11] then you blame them for their actions
[1:12:13] and you blame them for their misbehavior
[1:12:15] when you were the one guilty of it
[1:12:17] well that sounds hard but it's the truth
[1:12:24] you're the one that has to begin the
[1:12:26] process of fixing problems whether it's
[1:12:29] in the family or whether it's in church
[1:12:31] you're the one you're the leader you're
[1:12:34] the one to initiate has to initiate
[1:12:36] those things why why do people come to
[1:12:38] you you go to them so we can get that
[1:12:41] cancer out of the church so we can get
[1:12:43] that root that root out of the out of
[1:12:45] the family get that out of way so that
[1:12:46] we can move on and go with God and grow
[1:12:50] but you think we can grow when we have
[1:12:54] things still unresolved closure not
[1:12:57] being not being given about things that
[1:12:59] have happened we can't move on with God
[1:13:06] and that rug is just keeps getting
[1:13:08] higher and higher even if you think that
[1:13:16] you're going to be rejected go to the
[1:13:18] person anyhow make that right because
[1:13:23] you're you you it's a thing between you
[1:13:26] and God it's your relationship between
[1:13:28] you and God we're not going to heaven
[1:13:31] with bitterness in our heart I'll tell
[1:13:34] you that right now we're not going we're
[1:13:36] not going in glory with with things
[1:13:38] unresolved amongst us and things people
[1:13:41] are still holding things from years that
[1:13:44] have happened and nothing is said it's
[1:13:47] just we swept under the rug and time
[1:13:50] proves that that had time doesn't heal
[1:13:53] tom has not healed those things because
[1:13:56] they still keep coming up
[1:14:03] amen so we read later on then in in in
[1:14:08] second Samuel where David he's convinced
[1:14:11] that he should have absolute in
[1:14:12] Jerusalem
[1:14:13] Absalom comes back in Jerusalem three
[1:14:15] years that he's been he's been away from
[1:14:17] his father that bitterness still
[1:14:19] building and bubbling in him and that
[1:14:22] cancers thing and so he has Absalom back
[1:14:25] but we don't read anywhere in fret 2nd
[1:14:27] Samuel where where he has Absalom back
[1:14:30] and he and and David gets down talking
[1:14:33] business with him we don't the whole
[1:14:37] Absalon is back in Jerusalem great but
[1:14:41] David doesn't go and initially its son
[1:14:44] We Need to Talk son I'm so sorry son I
[1:14:50] did this What's Wrong son no none of
[1:14:55] that we don't read none of that in the
[1:14:56] Bible what happens is that when when
[1:14:59] thought when when when epsilon comes to
[1:15:02] David you know what happens all David
[1:15:05] does is give him a kiss in 2nd samuel 14
[1:15:12] 33 so drive came to the king and told
[1:15:14] him and when he had called for apps on
[1:15:15] he came to the king and bowed himself on
[1:15:17] his face to the ground before the king
[1:15:19] and the king kissed Absalom and that's
[1:15:23] all he and David's eyes he wanted a
[1:15:26] quick fix a kiss a pat in the back you
[1:15:32] go on brother everything will be fine
[1:15:38] and Absalon still hurting for what
[1:15:42] happened to his to his sister and
[1:15:45] david's lack of rebuke and what needed
[1:15:49] to be rebuked it was just superficial
[1:15:54] reconciliation amen no no talk about
[1:15:59] mending their their pasts no talk about
[1:16:02] going in and and cleaning out the wound
[1:16:04] note no talk about I'm wrong no no none
[1:16:07] of that I'll just give you a silly kiss
[1:16:11] or a pat on the back or a hug we don't
[1:16:14] like that I don't know why I grew up a
[1:16:19] man talking about things and resolving
[1:16:21] things right away why do we don't do
[1:16:25] that problems come up take care of them
[1:16:29] right away before they fester before
[1:16:32] they grow am I wrong
[1:16:45] amen you know what if you what if your
[1:16:49] spouse ain't meant but has there's been
[1:16:51] cheating on you and sleeping with other
[1:16:53] men or other women or whatever and they
[1:16:56] and they get caught and they just come
[1:16:59] and they just don't say well don't worry
[1:17:01] about it you just let's just move on
[1:17:03] come on just don't worry about it let's
[1:17:06] just move on what do you think that wife
[1:17:09] or that husband to think about about
[1:17:11] that how should they react towards that
[1:17:15] and yeah that's what we do with our
[1:17:17] children that's what we do in the church
[1:17:20] that's what we do with all these issues
[1:17:23] that come up
[1:17:24] we just sweep them off and don't get to
[1:17:28] the root of the problem don't get to the
[1:17:31] heart of the issue because it's just too
[1:17:33] much work you know saying I'd rather
[1:17:36] have truth I'd rather have truth Amen
[1:17:40] I'd rather be out there pulling the
[1:17:42] weeds and taking everything out that
[1:17:43] needs to be done and what's left if you
[1:17:45] do that it's true but we don't like that
[1:17:51] we like easy quick fix
[1:17:53] microwave solutions because because we
[1:18:00] don't want to go through the pain of
[1:18:01] deep healing the the consequences of
[1:18:06] David's silence towards eminence in
[1:18:09] against Tamar caused epsilon to grow
[1:18:11] roots of bitterness amen so epsilon he
[1:18:16] this whole time was resentful
[1:18:18] he was revengeful he was constantly
[1:18:22] reminded of the situation in one place
[1:18:24] in the scripture where it says that he
[1:18:26] gave birth to two he had some kids one
[1:18:28] of the children's name was Tamar
[1:18:31] one of his daughter's name was Tama he
[1:18:33] named them after his own sister he was
[1:18:35] reminded of what happened and then we
[1:18:41] over react so we got this bitterness in
[1:18:44] us we have this this bitterness and this
[1:18:48] and this hate in this things that are
[1:18:50] unresolved in us and we start acting in
[1:18:52] unseemly ways you know sometimes when
[1:18:56] when when maybe our wife or maybe our
[1:18:58] bender or our children they're acting in
[1:19:01] a certain way and they're giving you a
[1:19:02] certain attitude and you and the first
[1:19:06] thing you want to do is is launch at why
[1:19:08] are you acting like that what in the
[1:19:09] world what's wrong with you but then you
[1:19:13] but if you step back and say what is
[1:19:15] causing that in them so maybe maybe
[1:19:18] something is bothering them that's
[1:19:21] causing them to act like that and you
[1:19:25] step back and you see and you see what
[1:19:27] is it son what is it daughter what is it
[1:19:29] what's going on this talk and then you
[1:19:32] find out that it wasn't the superficial
[1:19:34] reason it wasn't for a superficial
[1:19:36] reason it was something deeper than that
[1:19:40] but because you find out if you take
[1:19:43] time when you don't take time and you
[1:19:46] want easy microwave quick fix solutions
[1:19:51] and you won't find out what the root of
[1:19:53] the problems are so and so and so this
[1:19:58] rebellion and all these things that this
[1:19:59] this hatred was in in an Absalon heart
[1:20:02] and in one place he he sets Joe abbs
[1:20:05] field on fire Joe I being one of one of
[1:20:10] David's uh captains or helpers I can't
[1:20:14] remember exact what he was and he
[1:20:16] because he's building all this hate and
[1:20:18] all this stuff like that he goes in and
[1:20:19] sets Joab fields on fire and then in
[1:20:22] another verse you'll find that Absalom
[1:20:24] was up there in the roof sleeping with
[1:20:26] with with David's concubines just trying
[1:20:31] to take it all that hate and all that
[1:20:33] bitterness taking it out on other people
[1:20:35] and other they're not at fault
[1:20:38] whatsoever why again because it wasn't
[1:20:43] resolved from the beginning it's just
[1:20:46] getting grow a bit growing bigger and
[1:20:48] bigger we think that time is going to
[1:20:50] heal it no and not in this case who are
[1:20:54] we a man to be different than what
[1:20:56] happened to epsilon but what happened to
[1:20:59] David all because David failed to act at
[1:21:03] a very crucial time instead of sweeping
[1:21:07] it under the rug second samuel 1414
[1:21:12] you know what Saints I like what this
[1:21:14] verse says it says for we must need to
[1:21:18] die and there is water spilt on the
[1:21:20] ground which cannot be gathered up again
[1:21:22] neither does God respect any person yet
[1:21:26] that he devised means that his banished
[1:21:29] be not expelled from him this is the
[1:21:33] person that came to David to convince
[1:21:35] him to let Absalom come back to
[1:21:37] Jerusalem and this is what he told him
[1:21:41] he said even God tries to do what he can
[1:21:44] to restore to restore and to have
[1:21:48] relationship with that person and man we
[1:21:50] read in Isaiah chapter one of the
[1:21:52] brothers career very familiar verse to
[1:21:54] us Isaiah chapter one God is concerned
[1:21:58] God wants your relationship with if I've
[1:22:02] always heard this if your relationships
[1:22:05] if your horizontal relationships are
[1:22:07] right then your vertical relationships
[1:22:09] will be right
[1:22:12] they say that again if your horizontal
[1:22:15] relationship is right your vertical
[1:22:18] relationships will be right the one with
[1:22:21] God but if your horizontal relationships
[1:22:23] are down the toilet how in the world
[1:22:25] you're gonna say that you have a
[1:22:26] relationship with God you can't wash
[1:22:31] this is God speaking through Isaiah wash
[1:22:34] you make you clean put away the evil of
[1:22:37] your doings from before mine eyes cease
[1:22:39] to do evil learn to do well seek
[1:22:42] judgment seek righteous judgment relieve
[1:22:48] the oppressed judge the fatherless plead
[1:22:51] for the widow come now and let us reason
[1:22:56] together I don't see it where God says
[1:22:58] come and let's just sweep it under the
[1:23:00] rug and let's move on come and let us
[1:23:04] reason together saith the Lord though
[1:23:08] your sins be as scarlet they shall be as
[1:23:11] white as snow God is already God is
[1:23:14] already well and what he's ready to
[1:23:16] forgive but you need to come to him you
[1:23:20] need to make that thing right be as
[1:23:24] scarlet they shall be as
[1:23:25] let us note though they be red like
[1:23:26] crimson they shall be as wool if ye be
[1:23:30] willing and obedient ye shall eat the
[1:23:32] good of the land but if you refuse and
[1:23:37] rebel like Absalon ye shall be devoured
[1:23:41] with the sword for the mouth of the lord
[1:23:43] hath spoken it God is ready he's a
[1:23:48] merciful God he's more merciful and more
[1:23:54] gracious than you think why would he not
[1:23:58] want to restore that relationship with
[1:24:02] you when you've done everything you can
[1:24:04] to restore the relationship with others
[1:24:07] God's not gonna hear your prayer if
[1:24:09] you've got bitterness in your heart God
[1:24:13] will not hear your prayer if you have
[1:24:17] not made things right with the people
[1:24:19] that you know that you hurt oh they you
[1:24:21] lied to
[1:24:28] see because what and we're about to
[1:24:31] close religion is what man does to try
[1:24:34] to get close to God
[1:24:35] see that's what religion is is what what
[1:24:39] I can do to peas God but Christianity is
[1:24:42] what God has done
[1:24:44] amen to get closer to you and see God is
[1:24:49] the God is the one that advocates
[1:24:52] talking about things restoration going
[1:24:56] up and pulling out roots of bitterness
[1:24:58] and going down to the root matter of the
[1:25:01] issues he's the one that initiate that
[1:25:04] and why don't we do it and we're
[1:25:09] supposed to have the love of God why
[1:25:12] don't we do it that's the problem I'm
[1:25:20] gonna finish with this Saints the
[1:25:22] brothers could bring this up and you
[1:25:25] know Saints late later on we see that
[1:25:27] Absalon he rebels against his own father
[1:25:31] tri stic tries to to dethrone him and
[1:25:36] take over the connector kingdom and then
[1:25:41] you know the story and then Absalom gets
[1:25:44] killed by his own device Absalon dies
[1:25:49] all because david failed to do something
[1:25:52] at the beginning
[1:25:55] Absalon dies and Absalon and in david a
[1:25:59] man almost loses his kingdom causes more
[1:26:03] more problems in his family and in
[1:26:06] bitterness and all kinds of things all
[1:26:08] because he failed at the beginning to
[1:26:13] correct something he should have were
[1:26:14] corrected no matter what the people
[1:26:17] would have said and this is where I got
[1:26:21] this this title Amen I neglected thirst
[1:26:24] LeBron says I want you to see another
[1:26:26] great danger just before we close if
[1:26:29] you're not if you're not guilty of any
[1:26:31] of these things that I've mentioned and
[1:26:32] that is the danger of neglecting a
[1:26:35] thirst see you say I have a holy thirst
[1:26:40] but I'm not guilty
[1:26:41] brother
[1:26:42] or just go on joining church and things
[1:26:44] like this but see to neglect a thirst if
[1:26:47] you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water
[1:26:50] or food you will die
[1:26:53] alright and if you neglect that thirst
[1:26:56] in you for God you will spiritually die
[1:26:59] all right you call for revivals you wait
[1:27:02] for your church to have a revival well
[1:27:04] that ain't that ain't over the revival
[1:27:06] for you the revival ought to begin right
[1:27:08] in you all right take these things and
[1:27:12] apply them to what we've been talking
[1:27:13] about when you begin to thirst for God
[1:27:18] there might be another member of the
[1:27:20] church way wanting that revival it
[1:27:22] breaks out in you it will break out
[1:27:24] other places see but see you neglect
[1:27:27] that thirst you neglect to do what
[1:27:30] you're supposed to do you neglect to
[1:27:32] milk the cow when the cow is the utter
[1:27:35] is full of milk and if you let that cow
[1:27:37] stay like that she'll go dry that's
[1:27:41] exactly right if you neglect to take a
[1:27:43] drink of water say I just ain't got to
[1:27:46] drink anymore you'll die you neglect to
[1:27:48] eat food you'll die so if you neglect to
[1:27:51] give the Holy Spirit the Word of God
[1:27:52] you'll die because the Holy Spirit can't
[1:27:57] feed on nothing but the word amen maybe
[1:28:02] this isn't what you wanted to hear
[1:28:04] tonight maybe maybe somebody will take
[1:28:09] it and it might change their lives
[1:28:18] I'm tired of not dealing with things at
[1:28:20] the root level I'm tired of just living
[1:28:23] life and just sweeping things under the
[1:28:25] rug why why extend to our feet Lord
[1:28:46] Jesus as we come before you father God
[1:28:49] we thank you Lord once again for your
