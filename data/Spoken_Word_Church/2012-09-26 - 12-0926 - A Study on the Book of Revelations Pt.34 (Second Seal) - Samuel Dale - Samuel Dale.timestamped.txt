[8:43] revelations
[8:45] 1 1-3 that we've been reading for a
[8:48] while
[8:51] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[8:53] gave unto him
[8:55] to show unto his servants things which
[8:56] must shortly come to pass
[8:59] and he sent and signified it by his
[9:01] angel
[9:02] unto his servant john who by a record of
[9:05] the word of god you know the testimony
[9:07] of jesus christ and of all things that
[9:09] he saw
[9:10] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[9:12] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[9:14] those things which are written that are
[9:17] in
[9:18] for the time is at hand what is the time
[9:21] the time to understand
[9:24] we're in the end time so it's time to
[9:25] understand okay revelations
[9:28] chapter six
[9:30] in verse three and when he had opened
[9:32] the second seal i heard the second be
[9:35] say come and see
[9:37] and there went out another horse that
[9:38] was red and power was given unto him
[9:41] that set their own to take peace
[9:43] from the earth
[9:45] and that they should kill one another
[9:47] and there was given unto him a great
[9:50] sword and it may be seated the lord at
[9:52] his blessing
[9:54] to the reading of the word
[9:56] now we've got over in our studies and
[9:59] we're dealing now a little bit we're
[10:00] just
[10:01] catching a few points from the the
[10:04] uh seals and the things as they uh
[10:07] unfold unto us and it's a study of the
[10:09] book of revelations
[10:11] and we're trying to
[10:13] see the day and the hour that we're
[10:15] leaving because that's the promise
[10:17] unto us is to find out where we're at
[10:19] that's right all right so that would be
[10:21] the day but you remember now we've been
[10:24] speaking on the
[10:25] first seal which was revelations
[10:28] six
[10:29] one and two
[10:30] and we saw that the rider on the white
[10:32] horse
[10:34] was the antichrist
[10:37] and we read there in the scripture you
[10:39] can read it in verse one and two
[10:41] especially verse two
[10:43] that
[10:44] he had a bow and no arrows
[10:47] so his power was no good or even what
[10:50] little bit he thought he had
[10:53] we know that this antichrist is
[10:56] satan
[10:58] in the teaching ministry or the
[11:00] beginning of the
[11:02] uh you know of his ride because it's the
[11:04] white horse right and as it is then he
[11:07] had no
[11:08] no had a bow and no arrows so he's just
[11:11] a bluffing
[11:12] amen and that's what satan went out in
[11:14] that early church but he did a mighty
[11:15] good job right you know doing it
[11:18] all right but he had no crown
[11:21] see then it was a spirit because you
[11:23] can't crown uh
[11:24] uh uh you know it was it had to be an
[11:26] antichrist because you can't crown a a
[11:29] spirit
[11:30] satan couldn't wear a crown himself
[11:34] there'd be no way that he could put a
[11:35] crown on his his own head because he's
[11:38] not a man like we are right he's not in
[11:40] this form to where that he could be
[11:42] crowned
[11:44] so he had to come to earth
[11:46] and be crowned it's kind of like he done
[11:48] in the garden
[11:49] in the garden he couldn't uh
[11:54] he couldn't inject himself into the
[11:55] human race
[11:57] because he was not a creator amen all
[11:59] right only god can create
[12:01] but he could pervert and vicariously the
[12:04] prophet said or by use of the beast
[12:07] then he was able to
[12:09] you know enter the human race as much as
[12:11] possible
[12:13] not physically
[12:14] but as much as through the beast to
[12:16] produce the beast was what
[12:18] the beast in eve was what was produced
[12:20] cain and
[12:21] then that spirit was the spirit of satan
[12:25] and we'll get back to it at the end of
[12:26] the message but wrote around said these
[12:28] seals
[12:30] they they moved down or moved up he said
[12:32] it's basically the word
[12:34] moved up from genesis because everything
[12:37] starts in genesis
[12:39] so that white horse rider that we talk
[12:41] about the the antichrist
[12:44] you can see that that antichrist started
[12:46] in the garden
[12:48] it started to the deception
[12:50] of being there and you know
[12:54] it captured eve
[12:56] right and allowed the way of satan to be
[12:59] able to
[13:00] um
[13:01] vicariously enter the human race not be
[13:04] able to himself but through the beast he
[13:06] could pervert the whole human race
[13:09] all right then that would write all the
[13:11] way down to the bible
[13:13] i hope that you're getting it that way i
[13:15] hope you're you're listening to what i'm
[13:17] saying right that what we see here and
[13:20] we see it over in our day
[13:22] we can go all the way back
[13:24] right because right around said one seal
[13:27] will tie the entire bible together
[13:30] just one seal too
[13:31] you could preach every scripture in the
[13:33] bible in other words from one seal
[13:36] i know it and i don't know a whole lot
[13:38] but i'm sure i've been at it 47 years of
[13:41] preaching the first seal to you know
[13:44] from genesis
[13:45] because at least i can see that and
[13:47] bring it down but i mean you know
[13:49] bringing it to where we're at all right
[13:52] and as he did see that that spirit went
[13:54] for deceiving the people
[13:57] but once eve done what she done
[14:00] then god could not come down and inhabit
[14:04] the bodies our spirit soul a part of
[14:07] mankind in the old testament because it
[14:09] became perverted
[14:11] all right then he was
[14:13] purely just looking at
[14:16] a time that would come that he would be
[14:18] able to come down himself right and
[14:20] enter into the human race to to change
[14:22] things you know and that would have to
[14:24] be
[14:25] a 4 000 years later
[14:27] for jesus christ to be born but that
[14:30] spirit of satan has deceived man
[14:33] from the beginning amen that's right all
[14:35] right
[14:36] now we'll drop back at the end of the
[14:38] message on this but
[14:40] look at it as in kane
[14:42] when you come over to cain and abel
[14:45] you know
[14:46] we think about that as being maybe just
[14:48] a
[14:49] few days time but it might have been
[14:52] years
[14:53] in developing all right
[14:55] because see that antichrist spirit of
[14:58] satan
[14:59] and i use that because that ties
[15:01] together with the with the antichrist
[15:03] spirit the devil now right
[15:06] he he's in form of the antichrist spirit
[15:08] still writing we'll get get to that in a
[15:10] moment
[15:11] but yet see there in the garden
[15:14] they're right at the edge of the garden
[15:15] you see cain and abel
[15:17] amen all right
[15:19] now you know that abel was trying his
[15:22] best to
[15:24] help came
[15:25] to see the truth
[15:28] right
[15:29] and he was surely telling him
[15:31] that he was born in his mama's blood
[15:33] from his daddy's blood
[15:35] what the problem was
[15:37] well
[15:39] all through life you know you can see
[15:41] them and
[15:42] but yet it didn't develop too much
[15:47] but yet cain he he just couldn't believe
[15:49] that
[15:51] that's right so he believed that it was
[15:53] fruit
[15:55] some kind of an apple like people today
[15:57] thank you
[15:58] some kind of an apple or orange or
[16:00] pomegranate or something
[16:03] and see if he did
[16:05] then that thing just kept building
[16:06] inside of him
[16:09] right
[16:11] and as it built within him
[16:14] he became then
[16:16] as we know the second stages we'll get
[16:18] to it a minute
[16:20] he became then a
[16:22] prophet or a preacher
[16:26] to his doctrine right
[16:28] and he was telling abel you know
[16:31] you're wrong
[16:33] it is not blood you're wrong
[16:36] it's worse
[16:40] real good
[16:42] i'm out here slaving like everything and
[16:44] you're just laying up there watching
[16:45] them sheep
[16:48] you know
[16:49] right now you got to realize they had to
[16:51] be on up in age
[16:53] because they come to the time of
[16:54] offering a sacrifice
[16:57] and you would have done that at 10 years
[16:58] old or whatever so i'm like i'm saying
[17:01] this thing developed over a long period
[17:03] of time right now all right
[17:05] but when it finally developed see
[17:08] then his cane began to tell abel his
[17:11] doctrine
[17:14] then you look at it and see that he
[17:16] finally became incarnate with that
[17:17] doctrine
[17:19] and when he did
[17:21] it just went too far
[17:24] he shed the first blood right
[17:27] because he killed his brother
[17:30] because of his own doctrine
[17:32] that's right
[17:33] you say no no brother dale people are
[17:36] not that bad
[17:38] and they'll kill you today over anytime
[17:41] so you ought to know that
[17:43] you know
[17:44] i mean if you don't if you're blind then
[17:46] you're blind but
[17:48] you all you got to do is pick up a
[17:49] newspaper in the morning and just read
[17:51] how many people in there got killed
[17:54] by somebody that shot them you know
[17:57] whatever it was
[17:59] of killing going on today
[18:01] you can't you can't even turn on a
[18:03] newsreel without it being something
[18:05] about somebody being killed somebody
[18:07] going into school killing a bunch of
[18:09] kids
[18:10] where do you think that comes from
[18:14] what we're going to see tonight because
[18:15] it's the red horse when we get to the
[18:17] symbol
[18:19] and you'll see that he's still riding
[18:22] and he's been riding from genesis that's
[18:24] right
[18:25] that deceiving spirit back there he took
[18:28] everybody
[18:31] and deceived him right amen but the lord
[18:34] jesus christ
[18:35] amen
[18:37] and it became a great religious
[18:40] society how could you lay one thing
[18:43] to the charge of those pharisees
[18:48] how could you condemn them
[18:50] doing wrong
[18:56] they didn't play games back then
[18:59] now you might have all these garbage
[19:01] cans in these convents and
[19:03] all this stuff going on today
[19:05] but they didn't play back there because
[19:08] it was life or death
[19:11] for those pharisees and sadducees right
[19:14] if they didn't keep that word
[19:17] somebody else took their place right
[19:19] you know
[19:20] so it wasn't this plot haphazardly doing
[19:23] it
[19:24] but just kept easing in so slowly
[19:29] until when it finally came down that
[19:36] they started killing
[19:39] they started destroying them
[19:41] as we're seeing them in
[19:44] they started killing for any
[19:46] daughter idea of their own
[19:49] but what's that point of what i'm
[19:50] talking about and don't lose it because
[19:53] we're gonna we're gonna deal in a minute
[19:55] with
[19:56] work that this rider
[20:00] is the same rider
[20:03] on all four horses
[20:05] all right
[20:07] and that's what i wanted you to see
[20:09] see in that first seal
[20:12] that broke to the prophet
[20:15] right that he could see that rider
[20:18] and he would see that writer would do it
[20:20] as it wrote all the way down
[20:22] he said and he's still writing amen he
[20:25] was talking about his day right
[20:28] he sent it right out to eternity
[20:31] all right so don't just think that he
[20:33] gets off of one horse and goes home
[20:36] no the horse is a symbol right right now
[20:41] but the prophet saw that see in the
[20:43] first field
[20:44] that it would be the same writer
[20:47] oh it's been the same devil all the time
[20:49] right all right
[20:51] always been been there
[20:55] he's always been in the form of
[20:57] first deceiving
[21:00] now the devil ain't gonna walk into a
[21:03] church and say
[21:04] y'all fall down worship me i'm the devil
[21:08] no no
[21:12] he don't care how long it takes
[21:16] that's right
[21:17] that's right
[21:18] that's one thing about it
[21:21] he might not have the patience of the
[21:22] statue of a perfect man
[21:24] but the devil's got a lot of patience
[21:26] right
[21:29] cause he don't care how long it takes
[21:32] for him to get a doctrine right
[21:36] embedded in the people
[21:38] right he'll do it with just little bitty
[21:40] sayings that's
[21:42] right well god didn't go down to heaven
[21:48] come on
[21:49] well i got lucifer thrown out of heaven
[21:51] satan
[21:54] adopted
[21:58] the doctrine was that he was
[22:01] equal with god
[22:05] that he was god's right-hand man
[22:11] and he was wanting worship himself
[22:16] see that antichrist spirit started all
[22:18] the way back there
[22:20] and worked his way all the way
[22:24] all down now watch this in the second
[22:27] seal when we come to the red horse
[22:30] and then in your mind just remember that
[22:32] it's killing it's the blood
[22:34] that's what the symbolics is
[22:36] you know man that's why it's red the
[22:39] first one was white
[22:41] the prophet calls it a white righteous
[22:43] church
[22:45] now why would he call it a white
[22:46] righteous church
[22:49] because you couldn't put your finger on
[22:50] it
[22:53] but you realize one time
[22:57] that great mighty church started out on
[22:59] the day of pentecost amen
[23:01] wonderful
[23:02] amen right
[23:05] but after a while it began
[23:13] right
[23:14] right it didn't take
[23:17] no thousand years
[23:20] right there in the book of acts
[23:23] philip just knew how menius was teaching
[23:28] paul had to turn them loose
[23:31] are they the same ones it was teaching
[23:33] that the resurrection was already pious
[23:36] there in the book of acts
[23:38] the prophet said when that when christ
[23:41] went up he said
[23:43] there was judas hanging on a tree
[23:46] that spirit
[23:47] he said but when the holy ghost came
[23:49] back on the day of pentecost he said
[23:50] that antichrist spirit came right back
[23:54] trying to defile the church amen and it
[23:57] wasn't long until he had it defiled amen
[24:03] you say oh no you're getting to the real
[24:04] true bride
[24:08] well
[24:09] that's that antichrist spirit
[24:12] still working
[24:14] okay amen that's right and that offends
[24:17] you if we say it that way
[24:19] amen see if you think that satan is not
[24:23] capable of deceiving you and me
[24:26] you better remember
[24:28] he has deceived everybody right
[24:31] even as i brought out sunday
[24:34] your prophet was deceived
[24:37] right because he thought that white
[24:38] horse rider was a
[24:41] holy ghost
[24:42] right
[24:44] so until those seals broke
[24:49] there was nobody know the truth
[24:52] i don't care who you are
[24:56] i don't mean that derogatory i just made
[24:58] it true
[25:00] i don't care who you are to think what
[25:02] you think this way that way
[25:05] if you wasn't deceived with it we need
[25:08] to be following you instead of brother
[25:09] adam oh my god
[25:14] don't you realize what that devil's
[25:16] doing
[25:20] if you straight and rude around them out
[25:21] like they're doing today
[25:23] and everyone then we need to be
[25:25] following somebody else
[25:29] but i'm not going to turn loose folks
[25:32] you can do what you want to
[25:35] i've done come 40 something years
[25:37] following this message and
[25:39] i can't find no problems with it amen
[25:43] and i challenge that around the world
[25:44] amen
[25:46] come and show me the fallacies
[25:49] show me the wrong show me where he was
[25:51] off
[25:57] but just remember before you come that
[26:00] you're going to walk up to somebody
[26:01] who's going to say boo devil
[26:04] because i'm going to know who i'm
[26:05] talking to
[26:08] you remember i told you about that man
[26:09] that worked down there he said he
[26:10] wouldn't this pentecostal preacher he
[26:12] said i i'm not working on commanding the
[26:16] devil
[26:16] i've got past that i just command the
[26:18] devil he said i'm working on commanding
[26:21] the lord
[26:25] he said you know the bible artwork says
[26:27] command jimmy
[26:29] he said i'm commanding god
[26:35] i never did talk to him no morning i'm
[26:37] honest
[26:38] i'd wave at him hi
[26:41] but we didn't talk anymore
[26:43] why
[26:44] because i was talking to the booger man
[26:47] and i didn't care nothing about talking
[26:48] to him
[26:49] now you tell me no that he was a good
[26:51] man he'd probably give you anything in
[26:52] the world
[26:54] but that spirit had him captivated he
[26:57] was a false prophet to that spirit
[27:03] that had captivated him
[27:05] that he thought he could command god
[27:07] that doesn't mean command ye me that
[27:09] means take my word and believe it and
[27:12] i'll make it manifest that's what it
[27:14] means it doesn't mean command the lord
[27:16] you don't command god but you believe
[27:19] what he says
[27:21] amen and he'll move on the scene
[27:24] that's right
[27:25] i've been seeing it too many times so i
[27:26] don't have to worry about it
[27:29] but now listen
[27:32] see a white righteous church in other
[27:34] words it looks so beautiful
[27:38] we went through it there
[27:40] john admired that church on papers
[27:43] right the scripture said he admired the
[27:46] church
[27:49] if you went back there and looked at
[27:50] those people when jesus walked in there
[27:52] whose side would you have been on oh i'd
[27:54] have been on jesus
[27:56] well why ain't you now oh my
[27:59] whose side are you on now
[28:06] any problems with my stubbornness my bed
[28:11] hard ways of saying thanks
[28:14] and one thing about it
[28:15] prophet said you make it easy they'll
[28:17] thank you trying to deceive them
[28:19] i don't make it easy
[28:23] i just make it plain
[28:25] amen but look
[28:26] whose side would we have been
[28:28] on sorry
[28:32] there was the very seats
[28:35] i don't know why i've got all this off
[28:37] my nose okay
[28:40] there's a little pharisees
[28:45] who
[28:48] was that when the babies were born
[28:53] who was there when the sick was sick
[28:56] who gave them money
[28:59] who blessed them all the time
[29:01] told how wonderful they were
[29:05] and jesus comes in just beating the
[29:07] daylights out of them with a whip
[29:10] of course i'm glad he didn't and i know
[29:11] he didn't he you know who he whipped was
[29:14] the preachers
[29:15] right it wasn't just the regular old
[29:17] laity that he's beating him i i'm glad
[29:19] of that
[29:21] because i've had people arguing with me
[29:22] about daddy so oh jesus didn't hit them
[29:24] but people he beat them animals i said
[29:26] you're worse off
[29:28] man you know what to do with it
[29:30] you make any worse than the bible says
[29:37] goats and things that now don't do with
[29:38] it
[29:40] but listen church
[29:42] see that antichrist has worked its way
[29:44] all the way down
[29:46] that's right
[29:47] and it's still here
[29:50] look at the doctrines among the people
[29:52] of this message now
[29:54] it's moved from little spirits
[29:57] to doctrines right right
[30:00] now come on
[30:02] some of you been in churches now
[30:05] then when i get through with this point
[30:06] you're gonna
[30:08] you've been in churches that told you if
[30:10] you left that church you're out
[30:15] oh maybe not you know in a way not oh
[30:18] they ain't pointing you out no no
[30:22] they taught you that
[30:25] if you left them you left the word
[30:29] now that's beyond the antichrist
[30:34] spirit right that's even beyond the
[30:37] false prophet
[30:39] that teaches the doctrine
[30:43] that's the third stage which is an
[30:45] incarnate false prophet or a pope
[30:52] you ain't never heard this man say if
[30:54] you leave here you've left the word
[30:59] i've never said that about nobody's ever
[31:01] left
[31:02] that's your choice
[31:07] but listen church
[31:11] do you realize that incarnate false
[31:13] prophet that's where we're going to get
[31:14] to in a minute
[31:18] where your coat came into being
[31:22] and there's where your killing started
[31:27] how close is it
[31:32] there's a lot of people in this message
[31:34] that want me dead they're not mean
[31:37] they just wish i'd finally lose my voice
[31:39] and i couldn't preach
[31:41] well i'll eat cough drops till the day i
[31:42] die or something
[31:48] i wonder do you pray for my voice
[31:51] or pray for me to quit sometimes
[31:55] well it's working out sometimes i think
[31:56] you're praying for me to quit
[32:00] maybe we'll learn something from that
[32:02] but
[32:03] the church
[32:05] you'll see in a minute when this thing
[32:07] comes to that incarnate false prophet
[32:09] that's right
[32:10] that's when you start you kill it right
[32:12] yep
[32:15] when a person becomes one
[32:17] with the doctrine they're in
[32:20] you cannot do anything else with them
[32:22] that's right that's right
[32:24] he said god can
[32:27] i learned something a long time ago and
[32:29] two incidences
[32:33] and i'm probably working on the third
[32:35] one now
[32:39] you know i i used to pray god can't you
[32:41] straighten things out
[32:48] when god knew from the bottom of my
[32:49] heart i didn't mean
[32:51] to take the person's life to get it
[32:53] straight
[32:54] i meant straighten up the person
[32:57] right that's right
[32:58] right
[33:01] well you don't want
[33:04] i finally had to do it myself
[33:08] but you better believe i patiently
[33:10] waited
[33:12] for a long time
[33:14] until i had the word of the lord
[33:20] and when i have the word of the lord i'm
[33:22] not afraid of nobody
[33:24] because i'm gonna disbelieve it right
[33:26] until he changes me
[33:28] but see a lot of times you want your
[33:30] argument you won't say well lord can't
[33:32] you work out something
[33:34] maybe you're to speak up right
[33:42] now this is not your
[33:44] women praying that the lord straighten
[33:46] your husband out and give him a good
[33:47] timing spirit yeah
[33:49] i'm not talking about that man that's
[33:51] right we're talking about doctrines
[33:55] not talking about the men praying the
[33:57] lord i wish you'd take that old
[33:58] dominating spirit off of her
[34:04] those things i guess we need to work out
[34:06] ourselves
[34:07] that's right
[34:10] he said well
[34:11] why can't we are you praying
[34:13] need to pray
[34:15] like i told a man you're all back us
[34:18] you need
[34:19] i need the prayer brother
[34:21] and that's it
[34:23] and you need the practice
[34:26] he said you mean you need a prayer i
[34:28] said i didn't say i needed to
[34:31] the practice i said you need to practice
[34:33] me you need to pray
[34:35] but uh you know
[34:37] now listen
[34:39] to watch the seal as it unfolds now
[34:44] and you'll see that it's going into the
[34:46] stage of the pope
[34:50] the second seal see
[34:54] it will turn out to be
[34:56] when the pope got his authority
[34:59] he wrote a decree that was better
[35:02] to serve god
[35:04] by force right than to not serve him at
[35:07] all
[35:08] and by their own records their 68
[35:10] million
[35:11] people were killed
[35:13] trying to force them to worship
[35:16] now how much of a doctrinal idea do you
[35:18] think it would be that you would get to
[35:20] where you could just cut people's
[35:21] strokes because they didn't believe the
[35:23] way you believed
[35:29] i mean anybody would want out high cents
[35:31] brother you say years ago in order to
[35:33] know better now right
[35:37] now you still brother mo you know
[35:41] i mean i i finally got to work on devil
[35:42] he'd just tell me i'll be driving down
[35:44] the road brother won't be talking about
[35:46] this message
[35:47] boy he'd be laying it on over there
[35:49] and a voice would say to me so just run
[35:51] off the road on his side and hit a tree
[35:54] you say
[35:56] what
[35:58] i'm just telling it like it is
[36:02] you lie
[36:03] because you sweetheart fluffy dovey
[36:05] things you know i just tell it like it
[36:07] is
[36:08] so one day i told him i said brother you
[36:10] know what what's happening right now he
[36:12] said what i said there's a devil trying
[36:14] to tell me around the road and run you
[36:15] into a tree
[36:17] we got a good life out of it
[36:21] we see no no we're sweet love you
[36:24] oh yeah
[36:26] yeah yeah
[36:30] they didn't think jesus was too
[36:31] lovey-dovey when he whipped him
[36:33] preachers would run out right in that
[36:35] church
[36:38] whose side have we been on
[36:41] because we are on the side
[36:44] now
[36:45] we would have been on them right
[36:52] one way or the other
[36:57] okay
[36:59] now let's let's just come down because
[37:00] i'm trying to lay down something but i
[37:02] want it to tie together
[37:04] where you can see something
[37:11] so the first seal as it comes forth it
[37:13] was a
[37:14] church symbol
[37:16] what
[37:20] pure looking
[37:22] everything looked great
[37:26] but inside of it was death
[37:28] that's right i was looking today before
[37:30] i left i should have brought it maybe
[37:31] it's in one of my notes
[37:33] but everyone said it was death from the
[37:35] beginning
[37:36] he said was never was called death until
[37:38] the eagle came that's right amen
[37:43] because it deceived everybody
[37:48] the death that was killing people
[37:50] deceived everybody right
[37:56] so we went through the first seal and
[37:58] saw then the cymbals
[38:00] now remember what i said the white horse
[38:02] rider the writer himself
[38:05] sure
[38:06] that was a mystery
[38:09] nobody knows what that was
[38:12] right
[38:13] but once that first seal opened and
[38:15] brother brattle saw the antichrist
[38:19] then he knew
[38:21] the next rider on the red horse was the
[38:24] same fellow right
[38:26] amen he knew he would not change the
[38:29] writer would be the same
[38:32] because it's not a white guy sitting on
[38:35] a white horse and a red guy sitting on a
[38:38] red horse and a red black guy sitting on
[38:40] a black horse and a pale guy sitting on
[38:42] a pail horse that ain't in your bible
[38:45] that's not that away
[38:47] so the writer once he seen it
[38:51] once he seen that writer he knew
[38:54] whatever he said i don't know what
[38:55] reading i don't know what that second
[38:57] seal is but he knew the writer right
[39:02] sure
[39:04] right he said i don't know what the
[39:05] third fourth fifth
[39:07] but he knew the writer
[39:09] he knew who he's looking at
[39:12] right what i told you
[39:15] and i appreciate the first time i
[39:17] you know you go do it look but see there
[39:19] were some things i brought in the other
[39:21] day that the lord showed me about those
[39:22] seals that after
[39:25] 40 something years preaching them it's
[39:27] still opening right
[39:30] sure
[39:31] right
[39:32] same writer
[39:35] not a different color rider difficult
[39:37] horse all right
[39:40] so once the symbol broke to the prophet
[39:43] the writer was settled
[39:46] but that still it doesn't want the whole
[39:48] full second seal one that's right amen
[39:51] and then show him what the third seal
[39:53] fully was
[39:55] fourth whatever
[39:56] and then you better remember there is no
[39:58] writers
[39:59] after you get on over there to the floor
[40:01] right
[40:03] there's not a there's not a writer on
[40:05] the field right and there's not a combat
[40:07] beast on the field right six or seven
[40:11] right who might reach a book
[40:14] all right it's a great mystery
[40:16] but what
[40:18] that first seal he had a bow and no
[40:20] arrows
[40:23] he started out with no power
[40:26] just sayings
[40:28] right the same
[40:32] it's little bitty things
[40:34] you know them demons up in heaven i
[40:36] think about that a lot
[40:39] you know
[40:40] satan deceived a third of them
[40:44] and they began to say you know i think
[40:46] he's prettier than
[40:48] god is
[40:52] don't you think more to worship him
[40:57] then they started worshiping
[40:59] the devil
[41:01] lucifer
[41:02] the anointed the the morning star
[41:06] the
[41:08] great
[41:10] demon
[41:12] loser
[41:15] and that's just still going on
[41:18] because that's what he's wanting
[41:21] see god created you now for what
[41:24] worship fellowship and do it right right
[41:27] that's what satan wants
[41:33] but see it was just a teaching
[41:37] because there was no arrows he didn't
[41:39] have any crown
[41:41] the bible said there in the first hill
[41:43] and the crown was given to him
[41:45] remember we covered that the other day
[41:46] who gave him the crown the people right
[41:50] once he got control of him
[41:52] once he taught his doctrine so much
[41:57] if you think that ain't right you go
[41:58] find some of these people in some of
[41:59] these doctrines and you say something
[42:01] about their
[42:02] the guy that started their group
[42:05] can you see if they want blood rise up
[42:07] in their eyeballs
[42:12] right amen
[42:16] all right
[42:17] see a false prophet we found out what
[42:20] is one who teaches
[42:21] what the antichrist spirit
[42:24] is saying you remember that
[42:26] we brought it out from the prophet
[42:28] a false prophet then
[42:31] so what did it happen
[42:34] phillips and hymenius in them started
[42:36] out they had become
[42:37] one with an antichrist spirit
[42:40] so they were teaching the resurrection
[42:41] was already passed
[42:45] you know where they were getting their
[42:46] doctrine from paul sure
[42:49] yep exactly
[42:51] right yep all right
[42:53] what paul was teaching the spiritual
[42:55] resurrection had already taken place
[42:58] in the new verb
[43:01] they took it on over to the physical
[43:07] brother around them preaching what
[43:13] he was preaching into eternal life
[43:15] inside of us
[43:17] and that that would one day bring this
[43:19] mortal
[43:20] under subjection right to the one within
[43:23] i'm not going to call his name
[43:25] but a man went out preaching
[43:27] immortality in the flesh
[43:32] claimed he wasn't going wouldn't get an
[43:34] older
[43:35] let his hair grow out and combed it
[43:36] around to cover up the bald spots
[43:43] somebody said something to brother
[43:44] branham he said
[43:46] he gets the tapes
[43:50] he's heard the message
[43:53] man what about the country
[43:55] still got followers after him passing on
[43:58] as far i know he's passed on
[44:02] but you see
[44:07] when truth is presented
[44:09] there will always be
[44:12] antichrist demons
[44:14] follow that truth
[44:16] to pervert it
[44:17] that's right
[44:21] because that's what's always happening
[44:22] man
[44:24] you see when somebody starts preaching
[44:28] come on if i won't swap places with me
[44:30] but i stand here and preach i've been in
[44:32] 40 something years with
[44:36] preaching to you
[44:37] no one didn't realize if i tell you a
[44:38] lie if i mislead it purposely right
[44:42] i don't have no place in heaven
[44:46] i got no sense to realize that
[44:50] knowing if i try to deceive you with
[44:51] something
[44:53] i don't have no hopes to go into heaven
[44:58] you won't swap places with it that's
[45:00] right
[45:03] and realize that you've got
[45:08] a group of people depending upon what
[45:09] you're
[45:16] saying have no problems
[45:20] i didn't call myself
[45:24] i'd sure like to quit
[45:28] that's up to him
[45:30] i preached my last message he can take
[45:32] care of everybody
[45:33] until then i'll start trying to help i
[45:35] still try to hammer the truth
[45:38] but see when a man becomes one with a
[45:40] spirit he'll start preaching what that
[45:42] spirit is saying
[45:43] and that makes him a prophet i'm quoting
[45:46] from the first seal read you see a book
[45:49] i've asked you to
[45:53] but how many of you have read the seal
[45:55] i mean have you read the first seal how
[45:57] many are going to go home now read the
[45:59] second seal right
[46:01] just to come to me a while ago and said
[46:03] brother dale said once you've preached
[46:04] y'all did all that you're gonna wait on
[46:06] that daniel 70 weeks he said i went back
[46:08] and got my book and started reading and
[46:10] said that drawing that brother brown was
[46:12] talking about is right there in the word
[46:15] i said that's exactly what it's supposed
[46:16] to be
[46:18] he was the prophet
[46:20] all right
[46:21] see that's the way it's supposed to be
[46:23] you're supposed to go home and do the
[46:24] studying
[46:26] i'm studying to preach right
[46:28] not studying to do it and if you want me
[46:30] you said well brother dale tell me what
[46:32] to do
[46:33] read the seal book
[46:37] one more time read to see a book
[46:41] that's where i'm preaching from i'm
[46:42] sorry all right
[46:45] if you're in college
[46:47] and walk in and that's professoring
[46:49] is anything i can do to help me get
[46:51] better grades
[46:53] he'd say just go home and sit down and
[46:55] fold your arms and forget it i'll take
[46:57] care of it
[47:00] well i'll get out of there with you
[47:02] because you know that ain't gonna work
[47:06] they're gonna sign something for you to
[47:07] read
[47:10] i ain't got time
[47:12] stay out of walmart you have time
[47:19] come on
[47:23] church is time to just
[47:25] get it or get out
[47:27] this is death amen
[47:30] that white horse rider was death to
[47:32] start with
[47:34] but nobody knows what it was
[47:36] right nobody noted until that eagle come
[47:40] when he came he knew it was death
[47:44] so let's follow it
[47:47] see a false teacher
[47:49] of a false doctrine becomes a false
[47:51] prophet
[47:54] all right
[47:55] see then we was covering our last this
[47:57] past sunday for not strong wednesday
[48:00] before excuse me okay
[48:03] a crown was given to him
[48:08] a crown was given unto it
[48:11] the people gave him a crown right one a
[48:13] triple ruling crown
[48:17] what about a man that could just take
[48:19] the bible
[48:20] yeah
[48:21] make it say what he wants to and then
[48:23] people believe
[48:27] there's no such thing as purgatory
[48:29] but because he said it
[48:32] was now listen folks
[48:35] i got it written in here somewhere so if
[48:37] i repeat it's all right
[48:39] the first pope
[48:41] that was crowned
[48:46] he didn't go out and have people killed
[48:49] they didn't believe what he believed
[48:56] saint augustine i believe is a hippo
[48:59] with 1500 or something
[49:04] a lot of them folks were good people
[49:07] you know what they were bishops elders
[49:10] of the early church
[49:13] i gave you the quote last week was
[49:15] brother ryan said 300 years later
[49:19] so that would have been somewhere around
[49:20] 325 upwards going to 350. if you'd be
[49:23] everywhere he would want to calculate to
[49:24] start from the book of acts or whatever
[49:29] they crowned the pope
[49:31] but you know those guys were good people
[49:33] right
[49:35] they wasn't killers
[49:38] because he had to be as an antichrist
[49:42] if they had crowned the first boat he
[49:43] walked out
[49:45] anybody difference me or dead
[49:47] when everybody would have left him right
[49:50] no
[49:52] had to get him tied to him
[49:55] right
[49:55] so he started a doctor doctrine of
[49:57] purgatory
[50:01] now you know and we have a sister
[50:02] sitting here that was catholic for a
[50:04] long time and i'm not against them no
[50:06] problems he just types fighting stating
[50:08] truth
[50:12] they didn't start right out with these
[50:13] false doctrines it took a quite a while
[50:15] to get these doctrines of going
[50:19] mary the mother of god appeared about 3
[50:21] 41.
[50:25] and then it didn't even appear as being
[50:26] the mother of god et cetera like they
[50:29] would bring it today
[50:33] but it was entered into the nicean creed
[50:35] in about 341.
[50:38] the first thing i see in greek states
[50:40] emphatically jesus was god almighty god
[50:44] and no other god and no other substance
[50:48] most of you wouldn't even ever you've
[50:50] never read it
[50:52] most of the preachers in this message
[50:53] they preach about not seeing they never
[50:56] even read anything about it go read the
[50:58] book
[50:59] well i'll just take my brother brother
[51:01] said program said start out 325 a.d
[51:04] what started at 325 a.d
[51:08] the only thing they've done at the
[51:09] nicean council of the 325 a.d
[51:12] was injected a seed
[51:15] a
[51:16] antichrist spirit
[51:18] that jesus was a light substance
[51:22] it was 606 before they changed the water
[51:25] baptism
[51:29] come on get what i'm saying
[51:33] that first crown pope
[51:36] was a good guy
[51:40] it took a while before the bad eggs
[51:43] begin to appear
[51:50] even though he was already opposed
[51:53] but his first thing was to do was
[51:55] establish a purgatory
[52:00] catholic doctrine
[52:02] all people go to hell
[52:07] priest pope whoever he is
[52:11] he's going to purgatory
[52:14] we use the word hell
[52:15] to show gohan hades there's many
[52:18] meanings for the word hell
[52:23] and everybody that dies gotta go there
[52:26] you know why
[52:29] now why would he create that thing
[52:34] you know what i mean he created it
[52:36] didn't he he created it in the minds of
[52:38] the people come on
[52:39] he didn't create
[52:41] purgatory come on
[52:43] me don't be carnal with me
[52:45] i'm carnal enough as it is
[52:48] he in their minds created a purgatory
[52:51] right
[52:52] that their family went to
[52:56] and then what do you do
[52:58] pay money to get them out of it
[53:02] right
[53:03] right
[53:05] well then you can't leave the cabin at
[53:07] church do you get mama out of hell
[53:27] money scheme right
[53:28] right
[53:29] but it's a big control scheme
[53:31] that's it controlling the mind for the
[53:34] people
[53:35] until they become so captivated by the
[53:37] antichrist
[53:39] spirit until it becomes a doctrine
[53:42] within them
[53:44] right
[53:48] and they go by and they do the signs and
[53:50] the different things
[53:53] to a piece of bread laying on an altar
[53:55] that rats is running over all night
[53:57] we call it the body of god
[54:02] it deceived martin luther
[54:04] until god spoke to him
[54:11] come on
[54:14] but it took a long time before the pope
[54:16] got his final triple ruling crown he
[54:19] didn't start out with it at 325 a.d even
[54:22] he didn't get it at 606.
[54:24] i don't know exactly when they did crown
[54:26] him that part
[54:27] but the run said they crowned him about
[54:29] 300 years later right
[54:33] but even when they crowned him a pulp he
[54:35] didn't start out as a devil killing
[54:37] right
[54:42] you had to wait until a pope would sign
[54:43] a decree
[54:46] that's believing he was in god's stead
[54:48] and could say what god said
[54:55] see a crown was given to him the crown
[54:57] was given by the people
[55:02] that man wouldn't sit down there come on
[55:04] i don't care he's sitting up on the
[55:05] throne and here comes a crown down out
[55:07] of heaven
[55:10] now i ain't that dumb i hope you ain't
[55:16] the people gave him the
[55:18] crown right
[55:20] the people put the crown on him
[55:24] who crowned david
[55:27] king of israel
[55:30] oh it was the people
[55:39] see they gave him the crown
[55:41] that crown i told you there last
[55:43] wednesday that crown was not given of
[55:45] god
[55:46] that crown was given a man
[55:50] the power didn't come
[55:53] down from god for the devil to be able
[55:55] to work through man to kill all of 68
[55:58] million
[56:04] sure we know
[56:07] it was allowed
[56:10] right it was allowed to come into being
[56:14] but not giving them god god never made
[56:16] no hail or nothing like that he said he
[56:18] made it through the devil's anger the
[56:20] other lane destroyed
[56:22] but see he was given a triple ruling
[56:24] crown
[56:29] ruler over heaven and earth in purgatory
[56:34] to rule with
[56:36] go ahead brother anderson pull up number
[56:38] one
[56:39] some of these we had them before so
[56:41] we'll just read them again
[56:45] what was it
[56:48] when it comes to crowning time then you
[56:49] become the false prophet of the santa
[56:51] cruz teach it get it then he gets a
[56:54] sword because he unites his powers
[56:56] together
[56:57] then you don't have to ask nobody
[57:00] he's governor of the state
[57:03] he's governor of heaven
[57:06] receives a triple crown makes himself an
[57:09] idea called purgatory
[57:12] or if some of them die back there and
[57:14] they got some money they want to pay
[57:17] them out he can pray them out of it
[57:20] because he's got the power to do so
[57:23] he's a biker
[57:24] certainly he is he takes the place of
[57:26] god on earth
[57:29] if that ain't as plain as anybody
[57:33] we find it pull it on down through the
[57:35] bible and count his new
[57:38] numerical numbers and everything else
[57:40] here he is
[57:41] play him up back here in the number four
[57:45] not number three number four huh
[57:48] what is he
[57:51] bringing down to the bible right
[57:55] 666
[57:57] vicarius philly idea
[58:00] which is written over the triple rule
[58:01] and crown of rome
[58:03] take that down into roman numeral number
[58:05] one say the numeral number that's right
[58:08] and it comes out to be 666.
[58:11] that's right
[58:12] well brother down your name might be
[58:15] 666.
[58:19] don't bother me if it is
[58:23] al can remember we'd get some gas one
[58:25] night
[58:26] i pumped in the gas turned the pump off
[58:28] turn around he said brother dale i put
[58:30] in another penny
[58:34] look at the flop
[58:36] the 666.
[58:38] i just laugh like everything
[58:41] your name might be
[58:43] numerical numbers of 666
[58:46] but you don't sit on earth right thrown
[58:49] and rule the world so that takes care of
[58:52] that problem i don't either
[58:54] right
[58:55] so if you took billy graham and made his
[58:57] name 666 or roberts or whatever it
[59:00] wouldn't make no difference he's not the
[59:02] triple ruling crown of rome
[59:06] right
[59:06] all right
[59:09] but you see then you bring him down to
[59:10] that who is he
[59:12] look the next one
[59:15] that was program 162 the fourth seal
[59:18] this is paragraph 301 of the first seal
[59:22] notice when nicoletti
[59:24] the antichrist is finally he's incarnate
[59:26] of the man then he's crowned when he
[59:28] starts off as a nicholaity of spirit in
[59:31] the church i'm secured in the church
[59:33] he's a spirit you can't crown a spirit
[59:35] but 300 years later he'd become a pope
[59:38] and then they crowned him he had no
[59:40] crime to start with but he got a crown
[59:42] later see when that spirit became
[59:44] incarnate see he become a man
[59:48] look now you got a man that's the man of
[59:50] sin sitting in the temple of god
[59:52] lady and doctor and become a man then he
[59:54] could cram it they couldn't do it
[59:55] because it was just a doctrine
[1:00:00] see
[1:00:01] abel
[1:00:02] had a doctrine
[1:00:04] of the blood
[1:00:06] cain had a doctrine
[1:00:08] of fruit and works
[1:00:10] works especially if you'd call it
[1:00:13] i've even heard preachers in this
[1:00:15] message and you have to
[1:00:17] even in this church try to
[1:00:20] preach that
[1:00:22] the bible says that
[1:00:24] abel's offering was more excellent than
[1:00:26] cain
[1:00:27] reading genesis
[1:00:29] so with garba
[1:00:31] kane's offering must have been excellent
[1:00:34] abel's was more excellent
[1:00:39] i just thought myself
[1:00:42] what are you dealing with
[1:00:44] you mean it would be all right to do
[1:00:46] what cain done to go to heaven
[1:00:49] that represents works
[1:00:52] right need to be leaving the blood of
[1:00:54] jesus christ out of your doctrine
[1:01:00] i said i don't like that idea
[1:01:03] of course it didn't make me popular with
[1:01:05] a brother that said it and i couldn't
[1:01:07] help it
[1:01:10] father come your enemy because i told
[1:01:12] you the truth
[1:01:16] listen church
[1:01:19] he was crowned when the people
[1:01:21] give it to him
[1:01:23] the head false prophet
[1:01:26] now you know it's the way i said that
[1:01:28] because that's what it would work out to
[1:01:29] be because it was coming down through
[1:01:31] the the prophets to those fault systems
[1:01:35] and then they finally made a bishop you
[1:01:38] know to be over the doings and then they
[1:01:40] would make like an overseer
[1:01:43] or something your ranks would grow
[1:01:44] everybody would be
[1:01:46] and it finally came down to one man
[1:01:48] and then they got together and elected
[1:01:49] now
[1:01:50] i guess a tickle today
[1:01:53] you know they they tell them cardinals i
[1:01:56] reckon that's a good in cardinals and
[1:01:57] they all get together they vote on who's
[1:01:59] going to be god all right
[1:02:05] they do
[1:02:06] it's not just one name in the pot right
[1:02:09] right you're right
[1:02:10] there's a lot of names in the park
[1:02:15] then they vote right
[1:02:17] on who's gonna be god
[1:02:22] okay
[1:02:26] like i said i ain't that far off
[1:02:29] the head false prophet
[1:02:33] see
[1:02:34] the head guy
[1:02:36] finally became the crown pope
[1:02:40] right
[1:02:41] they elected him
[1:02:44] and made him a pope
[1:02:47] all right then the cardinals since that
[1:02:49] time
[1:02:51] they've come down
[1:02:53] see church most people don't even read
[1:02:54] like the nicean councils and
[1:02:56] pronunciation councils and there's all
[1:02:58] kind of councils with hell
[1:03:00] the the writings that i have in my
[1:03:03] briefcase right in there shows you
[1:03:05] that they even count the fact that when
[1:03:07] i told you about it the other day when
[1:03:09] when uh
[1:03:11] james was trying to convince him there
[1:03:13] in the book of acts that to call on them
[1:03:16] that they needed to get
[1:03:18] needed to circumcise them
[1:03:20] people
[1:03:22] them gentiles before them come in
[1:03:25] they call that a council meeting
[1:03:28] they call that a nicely in meeting
[1:03:33] there were hundreds of nicean meetings
[1:03:36] held before 325 a.d
[1:03:41] what's the hard part of it or the odd
[1:03:43] part
[1:03:44] is that 325 a.d was called by the roman
[1:03:47] emperor
[1:03:52] the roman emperor
[1:03:55] called the 325 a.d
[1:04:02] come on ring a little bit
[1:04:05] um
[1:04:12] at the next one
[1:04:13] regret 155
[1:04:15] and 158 of the
[1:04:18] fourth seal
[1:04:24] see the writer in the first place as an
[1:04:26] antichrist he was deaf to begin with
[1:04:29] you remember that while going i was
[1:04:31] quoting it
[1:04:33] but he's innocent then
[1:04:36] didn't receive the crown the triple one
[1:04:38] and when he did then he united satan
[1:04:42] unites his church and state
[1:04:44] because he was over both of them
[1:04:47] antichrist was satan in form of a man
[1:04:51] going down to a pope
[1:04:53] you remember what i said the fir the 325
[1:04:56] a.d was called by the roman general
[1:04:58] roman emperor
[1:05:01] that's when you brought in the
[1:05:03] governmental side
[1:05:05] before then it was a church system then
[1:05:08] it became a governmental system
[1:05:13] he started giving them all kind of
[1:05:15] things
[1:05:16] buildings and
[1:05:18] all
[1:05:20] kinds huh
[1:05:24] and it also signed that to you i believe
[1:05:25] it is the fourth chapter and what's it
[1:05:28] tells us that satan took jesus our lord
[1:05:30] up and showed him the kingdom to the
[1:05:32] world
[1:05:33] all of them in a moment of time and
[1:05:36] and the glory of them offered them to
[1:05:38] him and he said that they were his
[1:05:40] brothers said
[1:05:43] jesus never argued with him
[1:05:47] now this stuff belongs to satan
[1:05:51] all of these good
[1:05:52] i don't care where's romney obama who i
[1:05:54] already and i told you the other day
[1:05:56] what you want to do is back to pope
[1:05:58] be the president of the united states to
[1:06:00] get this thing to go
[1:06:06] but listen
[1:06:09] so you see then if you can unite it if
[1:06:11] he can unite his state
[1:06:13] and his church together then the red
[1:06:16] horse rider could ride sure enough
[1:06:21] now watch
[1:06:23] if it hadn't been constantine and the
[1:06:25] romans you know the romans came in and
[1:06:27] started doing and it became the roman
[1:06:29] catholics it became all those things
[1:06:31] they couldn't have started killing the
[1:06:32] people
[1:06:36] right
[1:06:38] the government would be against it you
[1:06:40] take a gun today and just walk down the
[1:06:42] street and go all right the devil
[1:06:44] god told
[1:06:45] well they're gonna put you in jail
[1:06:48] because the law is gonna get you
[1:06:50] right but the law's on your side and
[1:06:52] said it's all right for you to do that
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:58] then let just let you go
[1:07:00] you had to wait until you got church of
[1:07:02] state

[1:07:07] that's what i said those folks down
[1:07:10] through there wasn't too bad
[1:07:11] until they got together with the state
[1:07:16] and then when they got together with the
[1:07:18] state

[1:09:41] if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock today
[1:09:43] when the holy spirit came in the room
[1:09:45] and corrected me on something that i was

[1:10:13] thing just opened up to me and there it
[1:10:15] was the first seal being open go ahead
[1:10:17] to the next quote
[1:10:23] this is on the third seal
[1:10:26] all right
[1:10:27] last night we found out the same rider
[1:10:29] that rode the white horse
[1:10:31] was the same one on the red one
[1:10:34] the voice said in the midst of the beast
[1:10:36] called out see come see what it was
[1:10:38] he was in his living creature all right
[1:10:42] and he saw his black this black horse
[1:10:45] the voice tells his measure a week for
[1:10:46] penny now we won't get to that the main
[1:10:48] thing i want you to see is right up here
[1:10:50] white horse
[1:10:52] red horse all of it is going to be the
[1:10:53] same
[1:10:55] one
[1:10:56] rider
[1:10:58] then we'll get back to the seal part
[1:11:00] all right
[1:11:02] go ahead to the next one
[1:11:04] number eight
[1:11:06] i got 273.
[1:11:09] so i ain't writer now his first stage he
[1:11:11] was innocent
[1:11:12] and second now he went a little bit
[1:11:14] higher a little bit more than that in
[1:11:16] the second stage the bible said he'd be
[1:11:18] given a crown and they crowned the man
[1:11:20] the superman city crowned him and then
[1:11:22] the bible didn't call him a pope
[1:11:24] the bible don't call the beast of hope
[1:11:28] the prophet called him a pope right
[1:11:30] right now that's right the bible don't
[1:11:32] call him that because you didn't know
[1:11:33] all about it
[1:11:35] that's right
[1:11:36] i mean if they come out there in the
[1:11:38] bible says now the pope is the
[1:11:39] antichrist
[1:11:44] you know that thing that come out the
[1:11:46] other day
[1:11:50] you better look down at the bottom of it
[1:11:51] and see when the dates of that is
[1:11:55] that thing didn't come out the other day
[1:11:58] it came out in 2009
[1:12:02] why has it been kept so secret if it's
[1:12:04] true
[1:12:05] that's why i'm not touching it until
[1:12:08] it's fully enough maiden on
[1:12:11] because the the date on the bottom of it
[1:12:13] is 2009.
[1:12:16] you mean this thing's been there him
[1:12:18] saying that for all that time and ain't
[1:12:19] nobody said nothing about it but i said
[1:12:22] i'm going to leave it alone some of you
[1:12:24] don't know what i'm talking about that's
[1:12:25] good don't worry about it because it'll
[1:12:27] burn you enough until you nag me and
[1:12:29] i'll tell you someday but that's all
[1:12:30] right
[1:12:33] look the bible called him a false
[1:12:35] prophet
[1:12:38] why
[1:12:39] yeah of course he must be a false
[1:12:40] prophet by his antichrist spirit that
[1:12:42] thought antichrist against the original
[1:12:45] word because if you taught against the
[1:12:47] original word it was that christ
[1:12:49] and the word is god see the christ all
[1:12:51] right just prove it a point going down
[1:12:53] number one number ten nine
[1:12:55] he vindicates his word third seal
[1:12:58] and brings it they know they knew they
[1:13:00] rise again oh how i like that we they'll
[1:13:03] rise again here comes the black horse
[1:13:05] rider now dark horse
[1:13:07] there went to white horse
[1:13:09] we've seen what he done perfectly here
[1:13:11] comes the railroads we see exactly what
[1:13:13] he's done here comes the black horse you
[1:13:15] see the same writer all the time what's
[1:13:18] he doing writing down through
[1:13:20] the ages
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:24] writing down through the ages number ten
[1:13:29] four seal last night we had the opening
[1:13:32] of the and the third seal first was a
[1:13:34] white horse next was a red horse then a
[1:13:36] black horse and we found out the writers
[1:13:37] were the same writer all the time and
[1:13:40] that was the antichrist to start with
[1:13:42] you know no crown that was given unto
[1:13:44] him and all that let's see if i can find
[1:13:46] the one looking for it
[1:13:56] what is it then but i better stop here
[1:13:59] i'll go in with further i'll be going on
[1:14:00] the end of what i want to bring but
[1:14:03] what is it
[1:14:06] same writer
[1:14:11] the same
[1:14:12] writer the devil
[1:14:16] he don't change colors right
[1:14:19] he's the same devil
[1:14:25] now listen
[1:14:27] he was called the antichrist but he was
[1:14:30] the devil
[1:14:32] next he was called the false prophet
[1:14:35] he's the devil
[1:14:37] next he's called the pope
[1:14:40] but he's the devil the pope is not
[1:14:45] the devil personification of standing
[1:14:47] there in human flesh as we would talk
[1:14:49] about our human flesh right right right
[1:14:53] that's why
[1:14:54] he can die and go to the next guy die
[1:14:56] and go to the next tower
[1:14:58] right
[1:15:00] it's the devil all the way through
[1:15:03] and the devil's not a man
[1:15:05] that's right this morning i don't want
[1:15:06] to go to prophecy he was a man
[1:15:08] but he's not a man like this
[1:15:12] that's right
[1:15:14] he's the anointed cherub
[1:15:18] no man is a match for him
[1:15:24] the holy spirit is the only one that's a
[1:15:26] match for the devil
[1:15:29] he's deceived every man
[1:15:31] has ever been in the world outside the
[1:15:33] lord jesus christ
[1:15:37] and that deception was removed
[1:15:40] as a part
[1:15:41] when the holy ghost came and i would say
[1:15:43] part of what i mean part
[1:15:45] when that holy ghost came on the day of
[1:15:46] pentecost
[1:15:49] satan lost his main power
[1:15:52] he found out he couldn't get in man
[1:15:57] so he started setting up to the bases
[1:15:59] he's going to kill the man
[1:16:06] he's the same writer
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:09] the horse changes colors
[1:16:12] because the white was the righteous
[1:16:15] church
[1:16:16] the red
[1:16:17] will be the killing right the black is
[1:16:21] the
[1:16:21] doctrines and purgatories etc and
[1:16:25] heaven ruling i mean uh
[1:16:27] ruling over heaven and earth
[1:16:29] and the lights will be the beast
[1:16:33] it's the same old devil amen
[1:16:38] same old devil
[1:16:39] that's right
[1:16:40] he's not a man
[1:16:44] he's not a human being
[1:16:47] you can be called a man because you're
[1:16:49] talking about him as a man of what he's
[1:16:50] doing right but he's not a human being
[1:16:53] do you agree
[1:16:54] that's right amen
[1:16:58] so he has to enter man
[1:17:03] so in the first seal he entered man
[1:17:07] and received a crown
[1:17:13] under the first seal that the crown was
[1:17:15] given unto him read your bible
[1:17:17] he became a crowned pope
[1:17:20] under your first seal
[1:17:23] an antichrist spirit to a false prophet
[1:17:26] to a crown pope
[1:17:29] all right
[1:17:32] that's your symbols of the wireless
[1:17:34] rider right and the white horse excuse
[1:17:36] me
[1:17:40] and the bow with no arrows
[1:17:42] and the symbol of a crown was given him
[1:17:46] but when you come to the second seal
[1:17:48] let's read it over again we'll take just
[1:17:49] a minute
[1:17:53] verse four
[1:17:55] and there went out
[1:17:56] another horse that was ready
[1:18:00] once
[1:18:02] and power was given to him
[1:18:05] that set their own to take peace from
[1:18:07] the earth
[1:18:09] now that had to be permitted of god
[1:18:14] because he has no power but he permitted
[1:18:16] it right because of what he was going to
[1:18:18] bring to place
[1:18:21] once
[1:18:23] sit there on to take peace from the
[1:18:24] earth and that they should kill with one
[1:18:28] kill one another and there was given
[1:18:30] unto him a great sword
[1:18:34] he started riding
[1:18:36] to kill let's just go
[1:18:38] let's go ahead let's pick it up
[1:18:41] go ahead with number 11. i'll go just
[1:18:43] for a little bit and then quit
[1:18:44] i don't want to tire you but i want
[1:18:46] you to point the story number 11.
[1:18:48] now let's go to the second seal when the
[1:18:50] slain prison line opens up
[1:18:53] like come see what you see the lamb you
[1:18:55] remember has to open ever seal and run
[1:18:57] around and open the seals that's right
[1:19:00] the lamb opened the seals all right go
[1:19:02] to the next twelve
[1:19:03] all right
[1:19:04] now to my understanding this is to my
[1:19:06] understanding this great sword it had in
[1:19:09] his hand now we got about three things
[1:19:11] to look at now for about the next 15-20
[1:19:14] minutes let's just read and see what he
[1:19:17] says now he reads
[1:19:19] this scripture
[1:19:21] is given unto him a great sword and
[1:19:23] there are symbols
[1:19:25] here and we want to look at them real
[1:19:27] close but to my understanding the best
[1:19:29] that i know now you see jesus predicted
[1:19:31] the same thing in matthew 24
[1:19:34] and he said now you're going to hear
[1:19:36] wars
[1:19:37] and rumors of wars
[1:19:40] and just wars and rumors of wars and
[1:19:42] wars you're going to keep hearing oh no
[1:19:45] all the way down through there
[1:19:46] because that's what it's going to be
[1:19:50] that's what it's going to be
[1:19:53] because that's what he's doing wars he's
[1:19:54] giving power look at the next one
[1:19:58] and here's my revelation he's the second
[1:20:00] seal so we're just reading
[1:20:02] this is satan again it's the devil again
[1:20:05] and another form now the hershey writer
[1:20:08] what
[1:20:09] now what's he do it
[1:20:11] and we know that that seal pertained i
[1:20:13] said the other night trump is pertaining
[1:20:15] to civil war
[1:20:16] amongst the people among nations but you
[1:20:17] find out here that this man has a sword
[1:20:20] choice
[1:20:21] pertains to church political war
[1:20:24] church political
[1:20:26] now you might not think that but just
[1:20:28] watch it a minute just a few minutes
[1:20:31] notice the change of the color of these
[1:20:32] horses sane rider
[1:20:35] color off change of color of horses
[1:20:38] horse is a beast and beasts in the bible
[1:20:40] is symbolic the same system riding on
[1:20:42] another color power went from instant
[1:20:45] white to red go to the next
[1:20:49] the council was held
[1:20:51] and they elected the head bishop
[1:20:53] and by doing this they united church and
[1:20:55] state together
[1:20:57] and i said that one go but i want you to
[1:20:58] read it
[1:21:00] church and state
[1:21:03] is when you come together for the
[1:21:04] killing
[1:21:06] not because he just started out a pope
[1:21:10] it takes time
[1:21:11] once
[1:21:13] then he dropped his bow
[1:21:16] no i think
[1:21:18] you know no errors anyway
[1:21:19] but he dropped it
[1:21:21] he got off his white horse and he got on
[1:21:24] his red course
[1:21:26] or he can kill anybody that don't agree
[1:21:28] with him after what
[1:21:30] church and
[1:21:32] state
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:38] come on
[1:21:39] oh my god watch him go right on him to
[1:21:42] eternity you underwood unites both his
[1:21:44] powers together the same thing they're
[1:21:46] trying to do right now
[1:21:48] go ahead to the next
[1:21:56] is from the second seal program 287 289
[1:21:59] now brother level you and your teachers
[1:22:02] you and you teachers here i'm not seeing
[1:22:04] any age in the early church
[1:22:07] i don't know if you read this or not if
[1:22:08] you want to read it you get in smucker's
[1:22:10] glorious reformation
[1:22:12] you find it that when saint augustine of
[1:22:15] hippo
[1:22:16] became a priest
[1:22:18] under the roman church
[1:22:20] watson
[1:22:21] had the opportunity
[1:22:24] to at one time the holy spirit tried to
[1:22:27] come on him
[1:22:34] do you mean he tried to come on him and
[1:22:35] he didn't have it
[1:22:40] i need to stop right there and preach
[1:22:41] about three hours
[1:22:47] that's why when you come down here to
[1:22:48] pray
[1:22:50] and you're gonna be praying for the
[1:22:51] baptism in the holy ghost
[1:22:53] i don't want somebody down here shouting
[1:22:55] all around you
[1:22:56] and screaming and hollering
[1:22:59] and patting you on the back and
[1:23:00] hollering and telling you turn loose and
[1:23:02] let go or whatever
[1:23:04] i want your mind on god
[1:23:08] because you can drive the holy spirit
[1:23:09] away that's right
[1:23:12] does that explain what he's saying
[1:23:17] did not judas iscariot have an
[1:23:20] opportunity to receive the baptism of
[1:23:23] the holy ghost
[1:23:26] come on no no no no because he doesn't
[1:23:28] know
[1:23:30] he had it
[1:23:32] but he killed his own self before he
[1:23:34] went to pentecost to zeus coming to the
[1:23:36] upper room right
[1:23:37] now if you don't believe it listen
[1:23:40] i just stopped there to express that
[1:23:43] the man had an opportunity to receive
[1:23:45] the holy spirit even tried to come on
[1:23:47] and he rejected it
[1:23:52] watch what happened to him
[1:23:53] how many knows that as a teacher so he
[1:23:56] rejected the holy spirit so if he
[1:23:58] rejected the holy spirit he must of
[1:24:00] thought he already had it
[1:24:05] that's why i said i didn't have time to
[1:24:07] preach the message
[1:24:10] come on he must have thought he already
[1:24:11] had it
[1:24:13] he rejected it
[1:24:17] you're reading your prophet not me now
[1:24:18] we're going to read the rest of it
[1:24:23] he must have thought he already had it
[1:24:29] how many of you do not think you already
[1:24:31] got it
[1:24:40] i've seen a lot of people that told me
[1:24:42] they had the holy ghost but when the
[1:24:44] word was presented they turned it down
[1:24:50] i can't believe they got it when they
[1:24:51] turned down the word
[1:24:54] but they got mad at me and told me
[1:24:56] won't come here to church
[1:24:58] and i told him he didn't have the holy
[1:25:00] ghost no i didn't
[1:25:02] i did not
[1:25:04] i said i don't believe in anybody with a
[1:25:06] holy ghost act like you do
[1:25:09] you say well that's the same thing no it
[1:25:12] wasn't
[1:25:14] i put it back in his laps whether he had
[1:25:16] it or not right
[1:25:17] because i can't tell you whether you've
[1:25:19] got it or not i'm the only one in this
[1:25:20] building that i know has got the holy
[1:25:22] ghost all right
[1:25:24] i don't know if anybody else in here has
[1:25:26] got it right
[1:25:28] because i'm the only one that's got the
[1:25:29] personal experience right you said what
[1:25:32] do you mean i mean you've got to say the
[1:25:34] same thing
[1:25:35] come on are we quoting the prophet
[1:25:37] he said if i don't be one out of georgia
[1:25:40] i'm going right
[1:25:43] y'all better find you another state
[1:25:48] because i'm going
[1:25:52] but now brother right you got to go to
[1:25:54] another state
[1:25:58] let's see turn around brother damn i
[1:26:00] believe you're going to make it
[1:26:01] but i don't know about myself but then
[1:26:03] you don't have it right
[1:26:07] come on
[1:26:10] you know let me stop preaching stop
[1:26:11] start preaching them you let me read
[1:26:13] quotes
[1:26:16] but do you know whether you're born
[1:26:17] again or not
[1:26:19] that's right
[1:26:21] and upon what basis do you put it
[1:26:27] what if it would be
[1:26:29] that the words you hear
[1:26:34] would determine whether or not you could
[1:26:36] receive the holy ghost right
[1:26:40] give me scripture
[1:26:42] the disciples
[1:26:44] heard the word
[1:26:46] they took it and held it
[1:26:49] and the holy ghost came on 120
[1:26:54] when jesus was seen of over 500 brethren
[1:27:00] after his resurrection
[1:27:03] didn't get there
[1:27:11] come on mathematics
[1:27:15] 380 didn't make it
[1:27:21] something was wrong
[1:27:24] they didn't have the word planted right
[1:27:25] or something
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:29] brother brown said god will give the
[1:27:31] holy ghost to the person that's got an
[1:27:33] honest and sincere heart
[1:27:34] so evidently this guy didn't have one
[1:27:38] why
[1:27:40] because he thought he had it
[1:27:43] you said that's your assumption well
[1:27:44] what's yours
[1:27:47] come on what's your assumption
[1:27:51] what do you think it is
[1:27:56] why didn't the holy ghost come on the
[1:27:57] main
[1:28:01] you tried to
[1:28:03] pull it back up really
[1:28:11] had the opportunity
[1:28:13] until one time the holy spirit tried to
[1:28:14] come on him
[1:28:16] and he rejected and he knows that as a
[1:28:18] teacher so he rejected the holy spirit
[1:28:21] that's exactly what a type of the
[1:28:24] protestant church today
[1:28:26] that's rejected
[1:28:28] the holy ghost
[1:28:34] now that's what he said
[1:28:39] what happened then to this man that done
[1:28:41] that he went back down to hippo and he
[1:28:44] was the very one that signed that paper
[1:28:46] that had the revelation from god
[1:28:50] that it was all right and pleasing god
[1:28:53] to put every person to death that didn't
[1:28:56] believe with the roman catholic church
[1:29:05] but yet he turned down the holy ghost
[1:29:08] he said god told him that
[1:29:12] now listen i'm quoting from waterology
[1:29:14] from the time of saint
[1:29:16] augustine of hippo
[1:29:18] until 1586.
[1:29:20] so in there somewhere he was a 500
[1:29:23] something remember whatever you want to
[1:29:24] call the dark ages or whatever you want
[1:29:26] to deal with i don't know
[1:29:28] on the roman modernology roman catholic
[1:29:30] church put
[1:29:32] 68 million protestants to death
[1:29:35] was his sword read
[1:29:37] was he riding the red horse
[1:29:39] what was it the same power the same
[1:29:41] writer narcissiel
[1:29:43] they admit 68 million on the moderator
[1:29:46] beside all those put to death outside of
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:49] and mercy during the dark ages
[1:29:52] there were millions fed the lions and
[1:29:54] slaughtered in every way because they
[1:29:57] wouldn't bow down to that catholic dogma
[1:30:02] what about a church
[1:30:06] what about it
[1:30:12] but could we
[1:30:16] turn down the holy ghost

[1:30:22] no brother damn i cried and i prayed
[1:30:25] i laid my older and i fasted
[1:30:28] so did i
[1:30:32] for two years
[1:30:36] well i just take it because i'm in the
[1:30:37] message i believe the prophet
[1:30:44] i don't mean this wrong with this good
[1:30:46] point

[1:31:06] sunday on the daniel 70 williams
[1:31:10] putting together everything the prophet
[1:31:11] had to say about it

[1:31:53] saint augustine came in at 15 something
[1:31:56] saying augustine came in before 15
[1:31:58] something it was up to 15 something that
[1:32:00] they've done to kill it all right see
[1:32:03] i want to keep that straight
[1:32:05] because somebody
[1:32:07] come along and say he don't know what
[1:32:08] his ages are
[1:32:10] well
[1:32:11] okay

[1:32:14] bring it back to me amen

[1:32:52] forth
[1:32:53] a sword in his hand riding red horse
[1:32:56] wading through the blood
[1:32:58] of everybody that disagrees with him

[1:33:03] understands what that seal is
[1:33:06] do you understand it what's the next one
[1:33:09] they take the sword without will be
[1:33:11] slain by the sword they took the sword
[1:33:13] of dogma and antichrist and cut down the
[1:33:15] real true worshipers all down through
[1:33:18] the ages by the millions and when christ
[1:33:20] comes with his with a sword
[1:33:22] for his sword that proceeds out of his
[1:33:24] mouth he will slay every enemy there is
[1:33:27] before him you believe it he's killed
[1:33:29] him all right let's get some likes
[1:33:32] on this two more
[1:33:34] he says these are correct so we'll get
[1:33:35] to life's part there's the second seal
[1:33:37] he says said the lord if i'll go to the
[1:33:39] next number 18 for it and then we'll
[1:33:41] quit
[1:33:43] listen what he said
[1:33:46] if i only had time i'll try a few places
[1:33:49] to show you all this is on the seventh
[1:33:51] seal priesthood 63 324 the evening
[1:33:54] service
[1:33:55] i'll show you all the way back from
[1:33:57] genesis this seventh chapter once this
[1:34:00] seventh seal is spoken
[1:34:02] from the very beginning in genesis the
[1:34:05] seventh all right this is heaven seal
[1:34:07] watch these seals moved
[1:34:10] right up
[1:34:11] so it started back there
[1:34:14] so what happened with
[1:34:15] cain and abel
[1:34:20] came killed
[1:34:21] abel
[1:34:23] because of his doctrine
[1:34:28] somebody brings a doctrine to you
[1:34:32] you get mad and upset
[1:34:35] oh what
[1:34:37] kane you got a problem right that's
[1:34:39] right
[1:34:41] don't let it go too far
[1:34:44] you ain't to tell me i believe the
[1:34:46] prophet's message
[1:34:48] well
[1:34:52] well and good
[1:34:54] but so does the devil believe every word
[1:34:56] run around said
[1:35:03] he knows a whole lot more about it you
[1:35:05] and i do that's right
[1:35:10] became killed abel
[1:35:12] there was your first blood
[1:35:16] that started and set a stage to work
[1:35:19] that it would come down through there
[1:35:20] and it wouldn't be nothing but the
[1:35:22] prophet said wars and rumors of war
[1:35:25] throughout the old testament it was wars
[1:35:27] and wars and wars and wars and war
[1:35:31] brother tom
[1:35:33] he said no more war stories that's what
[1:35:35] he said
[1:35:36] because you'd read them
[1:35:38] david killing
[1:35:40] what was david's problem the reason
[1:35:42] david
[1:35:43] couldn't build a house
[1:35:46] come on
[1:35:47] says you've shed too much blood
[1:35:51] that solomon will build him your house
[1:35:56] been in the blood
[1:35:58] always been in the blood
[1:36:01] it's been killing all the way down
[1:36:04] right
[1:36:05] fighting and
[1:36:06] murdering just slaughtering
[1:36:10] even here in america the war between the
[1:36:12] states
[1:36:14] lost more americans
[1:36:17] but both sides were americans right
[1:36:20] more americans killed and ever been
[1:36:21] killed in any kind of war
[1:36:24] and they're just shooting
[1:36:26] bullets at each other in cannons and
[1:36:28] stuff
[1:36:31] i was thinking about it when he talked
[1:36:32] about over
[1:36:33] in israel the value of
[1:36:35] what is it
[1:36:42] it says the blood will run to the
[1:36:43] bridle's mouth of a horse
[1:36:46] you lay the horse on the
[1:36:50] ground it would take a lot of blood
[1:36:53] running
[1:36:55] i mean lay a horse on the ground
[1:36:59] what if you
[1:37:00] stood it up all right
[1:37:03] my brother dean and sister and my wife
[1:37:06] peggy and myself we were standing there
[1:37:08] and i thought about
[1:37:10] that one place has been destroyed and
[1:37:13] rebuilt 20 sometimes
[1:37:16] i thought how much blood has been shed
[1:37:18] in this valley
[1:37:22] all right
[1:37:23] millions of millions of people
[1:37:25] slaughtered over all those years in that
[1:37:27] one valley
[1:37:29] if you had all of that blood there at
[1:37:31] one time
[1:37:34] and that valley is not no little old
[1:37:36] biggie thing
[1:37:37] you stand over in one side in the middle
[1:37:39] of it and you see either side and 12
[1:37:41] miles is your limitations divide
[1:37:44] and it gets pretty thin going out on
[1:37:46] each side ain't no little bitty valley
[1:37:49] it's a big monstrosity of a valley
[1:37:53] but you put all of the blood
[1:37:56] that never been shed in that valley
[1:37:58] you bring it back at one time they run
[1:38:00] real deep
[1:38:05] in church
[1:38:06] the word is what's right
[1:38:09] right
[1:38:12] a red horse killing
[1:38:17] destroyed
[1:38:21] governmental power given
[1:38:24] to a pope
[1:38:27] brought him into a being
[1:38:29] that he could kill
[1:38:33] what about all of the obedience that
[1:38:34] he's killed with his doctrine right
[1:38:40] you see the second seal
[1:38:43] that's why it's a red horse
[1:38:46] and that's why he's able to take power
[1:38:49] was given to him to take control of the
[1:38:51] earth and to kill with us
[1:38:57] every war that's ever been fought is
[1:38:58] over some form of a religious matter
[1:39:03] whether it be between iraq and iran or
[1:39:05] what it be
[1:39:06] right
[1:39:07] or whether it be here in america when
[1:39:09] we're fighting our own brothers
[1:39:12] brothers on either side shooting and
[1:39:14] killing each other
[1:39:18] same thing that happened in the garden
[1:39:20] but
[1:39:22] they're at the edge of it with canelo
[1:39:26] that red horse has been riding ever
[1:39:28] since
[1:39:29] that's right
[1:39:30] and it'll ride right down through here
[1:39:32] and kill all that's left
[1:39:36] which you see the last battle is going
[1:39:37] to be the lords
[1:39:41] are they that take the sword or die by
[1:39:42] come on
[1:39:44] god's gonna take the sword and wipe this
[1:39:46] whole thing off okay all right
[1:39:52] it'll be a lot of blood
[1:39:57] but what about it
[1:40:00] the whole point see that i needed to
[1:40:01] spend a lot of time on
[1:40:03] do you know whether or not you held the
[1:40:05] holy ghost right right
[1:40:08] could you reject it
[1:40:13] what is the doctrine of most of the
[1:40:15] people of this message now i ain't
[1:40:17] saying everybody you know that what's
[1:40:18] the biggest portion of the doctrine of
[1:40:20] people this message about the baptism in
[1:40:22] the holy ghost if you believe brother
[1:40:24] brown was a prophet
[1:40:25] you got the holy ghost
[1:40:27] now that's their doctrine
[1:40:29] that's not mine i said that's of the
[1:40:31] people of the message
[1:40:33] if you believe brother brown was a
[1:40:34] prophet
[1:40:35] you believe you got the holy ghost
[1:40:38] well what else brother dale can i
[1:40:40] believe the word the prophet brought
[1:40:47] he come to straighten out the the
[1:40:50] fallacies not make more amen that's
[1:40:53] right
[1:40:54] you know what i was just saying while
[1:40:55] ago was right
[1:40:57] a lot of you've left churches and come
[1:40:58] here when you know that it was said you
[1:41:01] left the word when you left that place
[1:41:06] and if you left that word
[1:41:09] you didn't have no hopes of being saved
[1:41:18] i didn't know my brother said that
[1:41:25] don't be blind
[1:41:30] don't be blindfolded
[1:41:35] be honest
[1:41:39] and say lord help me
[1:41:41] amen
[1:41:42] i told you this what how many thousands
[1:41:45] of times
[1:41:46] i'd rather go through life seeking the
[1:41:48] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:51] every day of my life i seek god
[1:41:54] for more of him
[1:41:57] every prayer i pray lord is more of you
[1:42:02] i'd rather seek god all my life
[1:42:05] find out when i get down to the end of
[1:42:07] it because he said well you had it all
[1:42:09] alone
[1:42:11] then just not seek him at all and get
[1:42:13] down to the end of the road and him say
[1:42:15] depart from me i never knew you
[1:42:23] people laid hands on me and told me said
[1:42:25] brother dale i believe you got the holy
[1:42:26] ghost that wasn't enough for me
[1:42:30] i had to have my own experience that's
[1:42:33] right
