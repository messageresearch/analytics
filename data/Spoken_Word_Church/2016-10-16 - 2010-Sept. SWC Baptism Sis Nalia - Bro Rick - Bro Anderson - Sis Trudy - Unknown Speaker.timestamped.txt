[0:01] brother how much will you ask the Lord's
[0:04] blessing baptism
[0:06] Church bless dear father thankful this
[0:09] afternoon just gather here this special
[0:12] occasion people Lord pray God word of
[0:16] God take hope into their
[0:19] hearts multiply might be a
[0:22] bless pray Lord that you bless each and
[0:28] every
[0:31] pray that you guide each one of us and
[0:33] let us be encouragement unto them
[0:48] Father we have three already so if
[0:50] anybody else decides while we're at it
[0:53] be glad to baptize anybody else I always
[0:56] like reading scripture in in
[0:58] Romans to kind of
[1:01] express the
[1:03] things
[1:05] and you know where we
[1:07] can put it into the scriptural
[1:12] part never nobody should have any
[1:14] problems about what we the way we do
[1:16] because we're going be baptized to
[1:19] fulfill you hear me say to fulfill what
[1:21] the Lord Jesus said to baptize in the
[1:23] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:25] the Holy Ghost the only way you can do
[1:26] that is baptize in the name of the Lord
[1:28] Jesus Christ but father son and Holy
[1:30] Ghost is not a name that's that's just
[1:32] titles so then it's Lord Jesus Christ
[1:35] see that is father son Holy Ghost so it
[1:37] fulfilled I like to read what Paul said
[1:39] in Romans here Romans 6 what shall we
[1:43] say then shall we continue in sin that
[1:45] Grace May abound God forbid how shall we
[1:49] that are dead to sin live any longer
[1:51] therein now that's what your baptism
[1:52] means you're dying at a water grave and
[1:56] you're coming back up to walk in newness
[1:58] of Life That's what example as far right
[2:01] know you not that so many of us as were
[2:04] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[2:06] into his death therefore we are buried
[2:09] with him by baptism into death that like
[2:12] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[2:15] the glory of the father even so we also
[2:17] should walk in newness of life for if we
[2:21] have been canted together in the
[2:22] likeness of his death we shall be also
[2:25] in the likeness of his resurrection
[2:28] knowing this that our old man is CR CR
[2:30] ified with him that the body of sin
[2:31] might be destroyed that henceforth we
[2:34] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[2:37] is free from sin see that's what it
[2:38] means you're going to die to yourself
[2:40] and be raised to walk in newness now if
[2:44] we be dead with Christ we believe that
[2:45] we shall also live with him knowing that
[2:48] Christ being raised from the dead dies
[2:50] No More Death has no more dominion over
[2:53] him or in that he died he died under sin
[2:56] once but in that he liveth he liveth
[2:58] under God now what likewise reckon ye
[3:01] also yourselves to be dead indeed unto
[3:04] sin but but alive unto God through Jesus
[3:09] Christ Our Lord amen that's what our
[3:12] what
[3:13] our examples are for baptism don't save
[3:17] you it's an answer of a good conscience
[3:20] in other words you're doing what God
[3:21] Said So we let the little girl come

[3:26] little little Nala wants to be baptized
