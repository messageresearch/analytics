TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my want to see you yes I want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your lorry pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy [Applause] hi let's head up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we say holy holy holy a manly loving today holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you and we used to say turn around shake somebody's hand saying god bless you so let's just say God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you no sneezing now god bless you god bless you god bless all you out there in the in the parking lot it was full this morning that's good we need to stay on the road routine remember we're sheep we have to be led we have to do we have to do due diligence we don't want the devil he's getting enough place now let's don't give him a let's don't give him a full place let's cut him off at the pass good to be in the house of Lord oh let's see the only announcement I have is is now according to the state of Georgia starting I think Tuesday or somewhere in there we're going to be able to meet some more than usual well I just think now we need to kind of stay with all the men just I make an announcement now that all the men can come on Sunday and Wednesday if you want to and then we'll work in - week by week we'll work in to see if and I hate it but but I just feel that's the way we ought to do it I've been thinking about it all week and bill Adele's same way we just need to be diligent I notice the prayer cloth over all the doors and that's good we believe that we just want to make sure that we're doing the right thing and don't cause any concern I don't want anybody to get this thing and now we know people that do have it and Gainesville's become a hot spot because of people not social distancing and all that all that other stuff I we were talking about this the other day you know I they were condemning President Trump for some of the things he said but you know this virus he's killed by soapy water it doesn't take this great big washdown of radiation you know radiation chemicals they wash your hands and and then now they're telling us that UV light and sunlight kills it in less than a minute so the reason I'm saying this is if we if we decide to start bringing this thing back according to what I see on the on the news and the and watching the real not news but watching what the officials are saying or health officials that you might want to wear a mask if you want to but if you have that mask and you want to get rid of the virus lay it out in the sunshine just within a few minutes it'll kill the virus on the theme but but remember be careful when y'all are putting these masks on because your hands that's why they're telling people now that if you're sick wear the mask so that you don't make somebody else sick okay don't wear the mask to keep from getting sick because you can lay the thing down here somebody could walk by and go to and then here you go and put the thing on and you got it so the best thing to do is if you're sick don't come but if you do have the sneezing and the sniffles and the coughs or whatever you probably need to wear a mask to protect me not to protect you but to protect me and that way we can we can get rid of this things it like brother Dale said it's attacking bodies and it's attacking the sick a lot of the sick people and and we know how it's affecting the minority population and we hate that we're just going to keep praying that God will stay this thing and it'll be over it ain't gonna all be over but it'll be over as much as we so we can get back to church so that we can get back to and I told junior the day I said I don't believe I ever touched my face until they told us not to touch your face my nose itch the hope Danny I'll be out there delivering mail and my no be like feathers all over my nose you know yeah so anyway but the Lord blessed you do the due diligence you know even if we washed our hands more and if we hand sanitizers and if we did this more often we wouldn't get a common cold called the common cold is the fact in the same way it passes from person to person so let's turn in our Bibles to the book of 1st Corinthians verse 10 we're going to continue on the journey of a believer this is part 9 but we're gonna talk about the Book of Ruth so if you got your Bibles you want to stay there if not brother Henderson's gonna have it we're going to go like we did in Genesis probably verse by verse if we get finished we do if we don't see there I go touching my face again there huh so anyway hand sanitizer we're going to go 2 corinthians but we're going to talk about the book of roots because to me the book of ruth and you'll see what brother Branham says about this I found this quote that that you really enjoy because the Book of Ruth is really not about it's kind of like the book of Esther there's really not a lot to do with God and and Redemption and all but it's all full of it brother Branham said this is one of the greatest chapter greatest chapters or books in the Old Testament that talks about Christ the church and all the different settings as the same way as the great story of Esther so you got Ruth and Esther in the Bible doesn't mention God a whole lot in the Book of Ruth but it tells the whole plan of redemption to me and it gives all the four journeys as we were talking about the other day sitting outside we know it's Christians I want you to get this in your mind we know it's Christians that it's justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost makes you a born-again believer alright but then in the end time and as brother Dale's been talking about the son of man there is something extra that we get because we'll look at it in just a minute that the or combat be sly knocks man Inigo so it takes four stages to bring us back to full Redemption and then Lord willing if I do finish this this Sunday next Sunday we want to go back in the Old Testament and talk about Reuben and GAD and 1/2 tribe of Manasses because then that shows the book of shows the whole plan of redemption for us and showing what they got because some went over the end of the possess the land and some did not but they still went over and fought and come back so so it's really a beautiful type so let's go to 1st Corinthians I want to read this first and then we'll go into the Book of Ruth let's bow our heads family father Lord today we pray that number one that you'll save the lost souls so that's the most important thing this wall down below my feet is full of names of of loved ones and friends and family and husbands and wives and children of people that are not in the fold and we pray Lord that you would do a supernatural soul healing first and then we asked Lord those that have already went across into the promised land Lord that you'd give us rest in these bodies that you take all the sickness away and keep all the sickness away that you would bless Lord this congregation in the inside and on the outside and ones that are watching in the little bride around the world Lord we've come to a place to where we all now at one time within the last two months it has affected every person on the face of this earth in some way or the other so it has affected the bride so but it's brother Dale says this we're built for this we're astronauts we're built for this pressure we're built for this time and we've come to a place to where we need to learn more about you father the days are getting shorter and we pray that you just bless now give us supernatural revelation give us supernatural healing and Lord bless us as we go about our jobs Lord that we all do what we need to do and then as they open this thing back up Lord that you will just stay this plague father that you'll take Lord as we did in there in the book of Genesis and all the different places and Exodus and the different things that as plagues would come Moses and Aaron would stand and run through the crowd with a censor the Lord we have the Word of God we have the written word of God the censor of the day that we can send out among the people and Lord that they'll stay this thing and help us Lord all of humanity not just the bride Lord we know you're gonna take care of the bride but we pray for just people that are dying left and right Lord that don't know you father we pray for those people in those families the ones are in the hospital ones that are sick ones on brothers that Scotch prayer list and especially touch brother Dutch their father's still still trying to recover from those tick bites Lord we pray that you just be with him father give us our daily bread today and make us strong and healthy in Jesus name we pray amen this journey of believer part 9 this is Ruth's first Corinthians 10 verse 1 says moreover brethren now this is who this is Paul talking to the Corinthians I would not that you should be ignorant now that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea now that one thing for sure Paul knew that Old Testament up one side and down the other he knew every movement I mean he was right there knew the Scrolls back and forward so he knew what went on but now what he's trying to do is take that group of people and bring the examples to him or to us as Christians because look and we're all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and I remember this looks great but watch what he's saying and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual words every person drink of those miracles every person was affected by those miracles but with many of them verse 5 God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness they all died except for two now these things were our example to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted need to be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day 23 thousand people because the fornication died neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted them were destroyed of serpents remember they said they didn't want to eat the man anymore so God sent them quail in any also centum serpents neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now here's my point now all these things what we've been talking about of Abraham what we're getting ready to talk about Ruth and all these different movements in the Old Testament now all these things happened unto them for example and they are written for our admonition who upon who us our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come and so it's talking directly to me and you this is the end of the world we see the end of the world coming so all these things are for our admonition you may be seated in the Lord as blessing the reading the world reading of the word if you want to turn to the Book of Ruth you can or we're gonna read it from here but let's go down first because we're gonna try to parallel this oh my y'all put y'all put lines on there thank you these guys were good so now let's before before we begin let's get our mind set on this as being a Sunday School lesson are a little bit of teaching here the journey of Abraham we've already been through the journey of Abraham we went through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and I put in the new birth because remember you can have the Holy Ghost on your flesh on your spirit and every day of your life and don't go to hell I'm talking bout the new birth I'm talking about the faith of Abraham what brother Graham sales we've somewhat less Sunday God the faith of Abraham God gave him a seal of circumcision as a sign of Abraham's faith so brother Branham said God gives you the baptism of Holy Ghost as of what as a sign of your faith that you believe that that's what God's gonna do but now remember we also had to go through where that Abraham ten or eleven years old later than that twelve years later took his son his only son up to a mountain up to a mountain everybody went home that up to a mountain and placed him not really placing Abraham but he all but he did look at Abraham he said Abraham I know now I know now Abraham that that faith is grounded now did God need to know that know he needed Abraham to know that that Abraham saw placing or adoption is your fourth is that all right because the fourth stage a lot of people don't get to the fourth stage a lot of people didn't get to the fourth stages brother Dale was talking about the son of God listen the son of god requirement is this right here that's what was required down through the seventh church ages is for them to get justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost a little bit of teaching in the first few church ages but now Columbo wasn't required to be adopted Luther wasn't required Wesley wasn't required Pentecost wasn't required but you and I because of the son of man because remember this comes to this guy full adoption are full full redemption we're going to see this also in the Book of Ruth because you see the journey of Ruth you've got to look at four stages just if you'll go to Scofield Bible even Scofield picks it up that's it's Ruth what deciding what did Abraham do he decided all right Ruth serving what sanctification cleaned and set aside for serving our service thereby got that all right then you got the Holy Ghost of the new birth with us the circumcision you got Ruth resting and we're gonna get into that maybe if we'll get to that part where she rest at the feet of Boaz because you know what you can't give yourself the Holy Ghost it's gotta be the Redeemer God Almighty and human flesh had to come and die to give you the new Berk you can't give it to yourself so you just rest why Jesus had come all ye that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest there's not a certain day even Paul says there's not a certain day not the Sabbath the rest is why brother Brown said the rest was the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right then you're placing our adoption Ruth is rewarded for going through the journey and accepting all these things that we're going to talk about and she's rewarded with what a child with a child and that child through that child's lineage comes Christ David all the way down all right it's gonna be interesting right here in just a second but then you got your for combat base your line ox man in the eagle now watch the Eagle age the Eagle ages the high stages where everything you get up higher where you can see what the mountain and you can see that we need to come to adoption because if the son of man come to adoption we have to come to adoption and listen it wasn't the son of God needed to be adopted son of God Father the Son of man needed to be adopted to show that me and you need to be adopted or adopted are placing may we say either one because we're gonna talk about maybe next Sunday of the Sunday after how that that's what happened in the Old Testament with Joshua Moses took him to a certain place and he could see the promised lamb but Joshua the the Holy Ghost or Christ was the one that took the people over and positionally placed them in the land what'd he do he rewarded the children of Israel by giving them a certain piece of property because remember Abraham everywhere the sole of your feet touches that's your possession we're now from Abraham Isaac Isaac to Jacob Jacob was Israel so the children of Israel gets this blessing they get rewarded same way with you and I oh no doubt we get rewarded by having the baptism of the holy ghost no doubt that's God that's eternal life but God wants you to do more has God ever went backwards no man goes backwards we backslide God came back slide God keeps moving he keeps moving everything keeps moving forward that's why God had to send us the prophet in the end time a word prophet - what pull us pull us into a higher plane to pull us oh my it's it's hard I was telling them that Sunday School it's hard going up a hill when there's nothing there to go gift but when there's something up there if there's a big gold nugget as big as this room it's a lot easier you'll crawl scratch push pull but if there's nothing up there well we know there is we know there is what a body change waiting us on the top of that mountain no death is waiting us on the top of that mountain so the for combat beast you've got four stages four stages of what we're talking about roof for combat beast everybody got that say man alright so we good with that now let's go to the first first quote brother Brad mowing the kinsman-redeemer this is a good one to read if you want to read about the Book of Ruth where brother Branham says that this story was written I want just give you up this is the background because we're gonna teach a little bit on on each one of the of the characters in the Book of Ruth I think somebody just you said you read the Book of Ruth you just read a book okay all right well you're fixing that you're fixing to get a expanded version and this story was written in all the old manuscripts when they were segregating the Bible the holy men when they were trying to put it together do y'all realize there's books out there that they didn't put in they was book of Job Oh book of macabees there was a book of something else that was not included because they the holy men said no that's not that's not in other words it was the Holy Ghost telling because we know it was the Holy Ghost telling but what this Book of Ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accepted why if it's just a love story why would the writers and ancient sages accept this book as inspired because remember every book in the Bible is inspired ayman Esther even all that in this book here watch what he said though because there's a hidden revelation in it and in this hidden revelation you catch the real meaning and it'll bring you closer to God so everybody that wants to be closer to God we're fixing to get it so that's what he said you catch the real meaning so we're gonna look at today I hope we'll catch the real meaning I pray my whole soul this morning that God will catch every heart so spellbound till he'll reveal himself just what he is in this story because it's a story of a natural person it's an example to us what he is to you how to accept him so how do you accept Christ you got to go through justification sanctification in the baptismal oligos alright and when you want see it it's so simple you wonder how you ever went over the top of it but it can only be revealed by the Holy Spirit everybody got that same man and man so we're right on it right all right so now we're going to start into the Book of Ruth if you'll pull Ruth chapter 1 and remember Ruth is in four parts I kind of got a little bit of want to tell you about a little background on Ruth you know Ruth is one of the four women that there's a lineage in the book of Matthew there's a lineage if so-and-so begotten so on so on so on so but got sawing something well there's only four times in that lineage from Abraham to Christ that there's four women inserted all the other one is solomon begat obed I mean Boaz and bowie but right in there it says Tamar Rahab Ruth now remember you got to remember who is Rahab she's Gentile right Gentile prostitute but she marries Salman which is Boaz's mom and daddy and then Boaz mares are more - look how many people see that's why little Jews times they don't understand the Old Testament because there's so many Gentiles put into the inserted into that into that lineage they're going how this has got to be pure God told us we're not supposed to deal and you here comes Salman she mares the prostitute they have a baby called Boaz he types Christ he marries a woman called Ruth and she's the mole bodice and she's top of the bride so you can't really figure God out but this is what's gonna happen look that she's one of the four women in the lineage of Christ which would be tomorrow Ahab Ruth and Mary obviously all right now remember before we get started chapter one is deciding right roots gotta make a decision Abraham Abram had to make a decision and remember now we got to keep them separated to get the story right now Naomi and her husband Elimelech are Jews okay they lived in Bethlehem Judith what a place to live what a place to begin the story but now watch just as Abram had to leave his country because of a famine they're fixing to have to do the same thing everybody got that so then you've got roots and Orpha roots and Orpha are Moabites so they're Gentiles you got Naomi man Elimelech and they have two children named mainly on and jelly on Charlie on all right and we'll get into what their names mean in a minute but we'll read it but I want you to keep that in your mind that Ruth is a mole by Orpha is a Moabite naomi is a Jew and the limo which is a Jew because you got to see the types here everybody got that all right now in Chapter one let's start and remember now we're typing justification and you need to put can you pull that one back up where it says root chapter one because I want you to maybe you can see this a little better now right here where it says Ruth chapter one deciding Naomi old Jewish church would you do with that okay so here we got your four if you want to write these down if you want to just remember them in chapter one now Boaz doesn't show up to later on but Naomi is going to be a kite of the old Jewish church everybody got that Naomi as a type of the old Jewish Orthodox Church Orpha is the type of the denominational Church cuz you're gonna see her she's gonna try to make a decision but once Naomi really pressures her she turns and goes right back into her denominational Church okay so she made a decision it was the wrong one but she made that decision Ruth is the type of the Gentile bride that says wherever you go I'll go your God to be my god I'll be right here with you the whole time then Boaz is absolutely we know that bull has is the type of crosses everybody got there so there's your for now we know there's one or two inserted in there we're gonna see one that's going to type to devil but those are your four main characters even my launch I'll on and Elimelech they all die because remember think about this to begin your story to begin your story now you're married to somebody else right the devil your old husband's got to be dead before you suck you can do something so the old husbands have got to be dead of every one of these for them to make a decision so now let's go back to Ruth chapter one and go that's all right we'll go verse by verse is that okay now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled I remember there was no prophets on the scene this was in the time of the judges that there was a famine in the land now what happened in Abraham's time same thing comes up God calls Abram he gets up and gets ready to leave he goes over into Canaan and they're already in Bethlehem they're in the promised land this man named Elimelech and Naomi but when the famine comes remember I told you about a famine what are you gonna do you got to make a decision a famine makes you make a decision to stay or move well they got up and moved and their first problem was same way brother Brown said about Abram his first problem was he got up and went Egypt top of the world first thing they did they went from Bethlehem the Promised Land of God to a gaggy place brother ram calls it because you know what happened was mobile the morbot come from lot and having relationship with his own two daughters and brother Brown said it's been a gaggy thing ever since that's what he says I didn't bring that quote but brother I'm calls it a hair in the biscuit as southerners we would know that if he was preaching the people up in the different up in North they probably wouldn't know what that was but you know it's like finding a hair in your food yeah that's what he's talking about his herring the best you find the hand you will see is what he said this is this is this is to promise children leaving the promised land and heading down into Egypt or heading down into Moab all right so they went it's a sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and two sons and the name of the man was Elimelech now lemma which means my God is king I'll read the ones on here if you got Scofield Bibles right in the middle of it Bethlehem Judea is the house of brick we know what that is Bethlehem means the house of bread or the house of God's bread because remember they gotta come back they got to come back to that you and I have to come back to them and the name of the man was Elimelech in the name of his wife was Naomi then Naomi at this moment means Pleasant and the name of his two sons Madeline and Charlie on effort thoughts of Bethlehem Judea now male on means I don't know if I'd I don't know if I'd marry this guy or not then my lord means sick Charlie on means pining a whiner okey-dokey then but they came into the country of Moab and continued there and Elimelech Naomi's husband died now remember she said you but their boys took wives of the women of Moab which was orphan orphan means hind or phone in other words a baby behind her phone is a baby animal and the name of the other was Ruth and Ruth means friendship or beauty and they dwell there about ten years so they dwell there for a while now remember they got to make a decision though because now Malin and Charlie undyed also both of them and the women were left of her two sons and her husband now you know the old start the story back in the old testament is that if the brother died without having children his other brother are the are the mother had to have another son and that's what she's fixing to tell him she said you get Naomi's going I'm old now are you gonna wait on me I don't know if I got another kid in my womb you know another man so she makes them make a decision that's why God has you come to a place just like we talked about in Abram you come to a place in justifications where you got to make a decision you have an she'd they both had to decide when she arose with their daughters-in-law and I remember their daughters-in-law so they're more biased and she's a Jew alright that's that might that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people see God started putting everything back in Bethlehem because they got to make a decision to go back there because remember Abram went into Egypt remember all those things happened down there and he had to come back out and go back into Canaan so this is the perfect type of Abram and the believer and the book and Ruth is doing the same thing to me Ruth is closer because Ruth is a female and that's all of us we're bride we're female we're a Gentile bride alright wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return into the land of Judah and Naomi said in her tutu Luongo returned each to her mother's house the Lord deal kindly kindly with you in other words she's not rebuking him she's saying look the Lord grants you that may find rest each of you in the house of her husband because remember the only thing they had was their husbands were dead they didn't have no inheritance in in Judah all their inheritance they were immobilized they had to go back and find their mobile by parents and that's where they had an inheritance they had no inheritance going to Judah they okay with that 10-blade with you and I if you don't make it this right decision you go right back into the world where you were in and then the Lord grant you that you may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept now look they both said right here and they said unto her surely we will return with thee and to thy people now watch Naomi Naomi said turn again my daughters why will you go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husband's in other words there's gonna have to wait sixteen or seventeen more years and they were going to be 16 or 17 more years older even if Naomi could find a husband and have a child that may not even been a boy so Naomi is giving them the worst-case-scenario turn again my daughters go your way for I'm too old to have a husband if I should say I have hope if I should have a husband also tonight and should also bear sons would you tarry for them till they were grown now look orphan is taking this all in with circumstances amen she's taking this all in with all these circumstances how many times have we talked about circumstances Ruth is going don't care I'm going back with you orphans going well I gotta wait 17 more years I I probably gray headed now probably too old to have it and you understand circumstances I thought the devil gonna do he's gonna give you circumstances and he did the same thing with Orpha he gave her circumstances would you tell you for them till they were grown would you stay for them from having husbands name my daughters for it grieveth me much for your state that the hand of the Lord is going against me now in her grief the Lord's right there on the scene because he's right in this whole plan and they lifted up their voice and wept again and Orpha kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth Clavin to her in other words Orphic kissed her kissed the old Jewish church and said I'm going back because that's what I like I like to go back that way kind of like Lot's wife they got turned into a pillar of salt she did come out for a little way but you know what she done she turned in the look because she liked it back there rather than keep on going with life same way with Ruth Ruth clave unto her and she said Behold our sister-in-law has gone back into her people into her God's cards now see Abraham Abram could have made that same decision Abram could have said yep I think I'll go back make my loans member we talked about that and be a good safe place to go circumstances but Abram said now we're going this way she said behold thy sister-in-law is going back into her people and to her gods return thou after thy sister-in-law Andrew said entreat me not to leave thee or to refer return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and whether they'll lodgest I will Lodge thy people here's the decision that people shall be my people and thy God my God my God will be your God that's why listen folks that's why that when we make a decision we're making the decision listen to me based on the old Jewish because that's Jehovah God one not these three God things that we got now and all this other stuff we're going back when we receive when we as Christians when we walk with God we're telling the Jews what don't you tell what brother I'm telling you the Jew said well we don't cut him up in three pieces brother Graham said well I don't either he said well bless you son why cuz that's the original and the Old Testament is the original Jehovah God one God that we're supposed to follow where thou diced well I'd uh and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if aught but death Part D in me she had made such a decision till wherever Naomi's going I'm going with you all right now remember though she had zero inheritance zero inheritance because her husband had died they had no children to pass that inheritance onto all right Naomi's husband had died but she had listened she had inheritance the original Jews still have inheritance I'm telling you God's not gonna forget them they're gonna get that land in the Millenium whatever they've done in the past has been forgiven that's justification they put him on a cross and he still forgave them so they're gonna get an inheritance but you and I are the wife because remember Naomi wasn't the wife - Boaz Ruth was the wife - beau as we get Christ Naomi gets a blessing Naomi gets caught under redemption Naomi gets all of her possession back but she never gets Boaz you and I get Boaz hey man what a beautiful picture when she saw that she was steadfast that's what God wants he wants to know if you know that you know so they too went until they came to Bethlehem know what this is so beautiful brother mark did you get this what time did they get to Bethlehem so they too went until they came to Bethlehem nether hidden by and come back and it came to pass when they were come to Bethlehem that all the city was moved about them they said is this Naomi she's back remember she'd be gone for ten years she'd been out of the picture she's going back to her homeland and she said unto them call me not Naomi call me Mara because Mara means bitter member of the marijuana the bitter waters brother Brahm tells us I didn't bring all the quotes brother mom tells us at that point that Naomi is looking across Jerusalem and she's crying she's crying she's coming back home this is what I got written in my Bible that brother brown said the Jews are returning to their homeland right here this is the Jews returning to the homeland saying I'm back in the Promised Land because God's not gonna deal with them until they come back to the promised land call me that don't call me Naomi call me Mara for the Almighty I've dealt very bitterly with me I went out full and the Lord had brought me home empty why then call me now Naomi seeing the Lord has testified against me and the Almighty has afflicted me all those years you can say the Jews can say hey I was killed by the millions during Hitler I went out forward with the promise but I'm coming back empty but God says I don't worry about it I've got you covered this is just chapter one of four chapters of this story don't worry because I'm going to bring you right back into the end because you've seen Naomi from this point forward naomi is kind of just kind severy once in a while and kind of nudges and Ruth in but at the very end she comes back into what because remember Boaz doesn't redeem Ruth first he Reedy has to redeem Naomi first to get Ruth he had to redeem his well first Father forgive them they know not what they're doing but knowing that he was going to get a Gentile bride out of it hey that so Naomi turned in ruth the moabite us her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of Moab another come back to Bethlehem when at the beginning of the harvest not at the beginning of the planting this is the beginning of the latter rain harvest that's menu we've come back to Bethlehem we've come back to our promised land at the beginning of the harvest because God's getting ready right now to take what harvest harvest - but - you got to see the pipes because barley means life they come back now to where they're going to take life and make bread out of it oh it's a beautiful picture man it's wonderful wonderful picture so now let's go to Ruth chapter 2 because remember Ruth chapter 2 is what you got to keep looking now Ruth chapter 2 that one chapter one was deciding that was justification he she had to make a decision she had to go with God she went with Naomi who was going with God so you got to keep Naomi in there but now remember here is where the connection is because remember Christ came to his own and his own received him not because look the near kinsman was - Naomi not to Ruth the near kinsman was to Naomi the Jew not to remember even even God tells him says look don't even go out there to those Gentiles go to Europe my people because remember he had to come to them first he had to come this first cause he wrote this and he knew what this type was and Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of wealth of the family of a moment of Elimelech and his name was Boaz now Boaz is the one that does the redeeming right he's the kinsman redeemer now like what brother Brown says - he says look he said it couldn't just Bend just any kinfolk this guy's got to be wealthy he's got to own the whole world he couldn't be just somebody that made us scratched off a living no this guy that she met had to be the king of the world so Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's a mighty man of wealth now remember we're getting into what Ruth's serving this is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service watch what Naomi does with Ruth because watch Ruth is fixing - coming to the picture no one's gonna step to the side because you know what she's still there Boaz is the only kinfolk she has nearer kinsman at the moment I said at the moment cuz you got to let the story unfold don't remember there was one in between that we got to deal with in a little while not right now all right and Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him and who Silas shall find Grace and Naomi said unto her go my daughter now remember she had no guidance where to go Naomi didn't say go get in his field right here but watch what happened and she went Ruth and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her HAP you know what that word means her fortune her happenstance she didn't just happen upon this field brother Brown says in one quote I got here she was led by the Holy Ghost to go to that field just like you and I are led by the Holy Ghost to go to a certain place Amen because remember we're in sanctification and she went came and gleaned in the field now what's she doing she's picking up food brother Brahim says one time I didn't bring all the quotes so you might get finished with this if not that's okay the RAM says she was poor look when Naomi comes back with Ruth dragging along behind her she don't have no possession she's been 10 years gone her property's been sold it's been probably chopped up in different ways her houses she won't have a house to go to they have to find a little rent shack somewhere and they only so old she's sending a little young Ruth to work that's what brother Brown says this in the quote right here she had to work she said I like that he said a believer said when you first start out you poor you know what I mean poor so you have to work you have to work at it sanctification is a work justification is work a week they will know got you two just broke right and just lay that barley down right at her feet and know you got something to do with it you're still deciding but you gotta serve before God can see because at this point in time Boaz doesn't know Ruth doesn't know who she is yet and her hat was too light on the part of the field belonging to Boaz who was of the kindred I'm Elimelech and behold Boaz came from where what was Christ born that's him okay and sending to the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord blessed day their brother Evan talks about the Reapers being angels and the Reapers being preachers she gets into right field here's the right sermon pretty good huh then said Boaz into his servant that was set over the Reapers there's this church coming up here uh-huh who is this who is this woman that she looks a little different than the rest of these people that I've been dealing with and the servant that was set over the Reapers answered and said it is the MOBOTIX damsel now right there most people would have said who ya know ain't dealing with that woman she's a Gentile but no boys saw her character he saw her character and heard from her servants that she was a virtuous woman you'll see this coming a little bit further it is the MOBOTIX damsel that came back with Naomi boom Boaz says I'm kin to Naomi she's lost everything she's got and she's brought this beautiful lady that's not out there saying bless God I'm gonna take all the food out of your field and the Reapers get behind me no she waits till the Reapers get finished and she goes by and picks up just enough for her and Naomi to make cakes with his brother man will tell you makes cakes with mashes her the corn up and makes cakes for them to survive barely survived it is the mobilis damsel that came back when they only out of the country of Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers now this isn't Ruth talking to the Reaper she walks into this field humble virtuous humble woman the true church and says I'll just take what's left just give me what's left so she came and have continued look this I'm just gonna say it and she continued even from the morning until now and she tarried a little while she rested a little bit but she's been working since sunup she's comes to every service she reads her Bible she studies Boaz is looking at the character but he's listening from the servants that's been in the field whether the whole time what kind of woman this is didn't said Boaz under Ruth harristown not my daughter don't ought to glean in another field don't go listen to another preacher oh that's what brother Brown says I'm done that's like all these quotes laid out here if you need them I got them right here but brother Brown says you're in my field you don't need to go to another field you don't need to get fed in four or five different fields you need to get fed in my field so any what I'm saying it's not here here I'm just saying any holy ghost preacher that preaches the Word of God you need to be in their field you need to be in their field not jumping from one field to the other because look neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee remember she's a virtuous woman and when thou are at thirst going to the vessels vessels vessels and drink water which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found grace in nine eyes that thou should have take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger look how humble she's not doing this out of spite she's not doing this cuz she's doing it because she said why in the world because remember she doesn't know who Boaz this she's only in sanctification she don't know everything about her mate yet Naomi's got the connection because remember she's gonna go back home and tell Naomi here in just a few minutes hey Naomi's like where'd you get all this word where'd you get all this food oh I just happened to be in this field to this man they called Boaz and then Naomi's like oh Lord the hand of God this is my kinfolk my nearest kid how'd you find him that's a beautiful picture I'm telling you you you just keep cleaning and gleaning out of this thing Boaz answered and said unto me look it has fully fully been showed me all that thou has done until I mother-in-law somebody has told him a story remember the Holy Ghost comes and tells the father this is a good son this is a bad son that's what the Holy Ghost is giving for what the leaders and guys into all truth and what to show our character because we're talking about character here because remember Boaz does not we know who she is until somebody tells him who she is now look since the death of line husband her denominational husband's dad so I can marry her now he's got that in his planning in his mind because she's beautiful she's virtuous nobody said one word bad about her that's sanctification cleaned and set aside for service hey man let's see just to me it's just you just sit there and read it you you keep writing notes and keep writing notes and keep writing notes but watch this and Boaz answered and said unto her it had fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thine activity what you made a decision to turn and go in another direction and headed right straight toward poets and aren't coming to a people which thou knewest not heretofore the Lord recompense thy work o my work sacrifice serving sanctification God wants to did why did God give you a new spirit he can give you the Holy Spirit to give you a new spirit what see if you'd come to church see if you would pray see if you would study see if you would do the things of God amen not for God's benefit but for ours so Boaz is watching Ruth to see I wonder if she'll show up to church tomorrow I wonder if she'll show up to this field again tomorrow well you know what she comes back every day she shows her virtue by her actions right then she said let me find favor oh I'm sorry the Lord recompense that work and a full reward be given the of the Lord God of Israel kept wolrd under whose wings thou art come to trust under eagle's wings are you covered then she said let me find favor in thy sight my Lord Lord let me be worthy of what you've give me even in sanctification let me be worthy of what you've get this new spirit you've gave me this new field that I'm gleaning out of now this new word that I'm I've been in I've been in a famine down in the world but now you put me in the right field and I'm in the right position and I'm in the right place and I'm hearing the right word and I'm what I'm growing in God then she said let me find favor in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou has spoken friendly until then had made though I be not like any of that handmaids in other words that like brother Branham says he says look you start wearing dress you quit cuttin your hair you quit wearing makeup you guys quit going to the bars you could a sanctification you're in a new group of people you don't like that other group of people you're in a new group of people and Boaz said unto her at mealtime comes out Heather what time when it's time to eat and eat of the bread and dip the morsel in the vinegar not just coming glean she's got all this she's got to carry back and beat it up and make flour and mate meal no he said come unto me I've got already the bread made I've already got this vinegar here and she sat beside the Reapers and he reached her parts corn and she did eat and was suffice and left and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and burp oats were not because remember God made a provision for poor people in the Old Testament remember in the fields you were supposed to cut the corner if I understand what I'm saying you have a corner like this you're supposed to clean like this and leave a corner for the poor and they could go in and they could glean he's giving her the whole field you just go right behind the Reapers and whatever they drop don't be out the corners over just getting a little bit of word no get out here in this field and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose we've heard the songs of hands full of purpose watch brother Brad and brother Bob tells us he says God drops you a little revelation God drops you a little revival God drops you a little stimulation God drops your revelation in your field and he actually says handfuls on purpose God drops little handfuls of purpose through the Reapers through the what through the preachers every once in a while when you come to church I said every once in a while because you might not get something every time you come to church but every once in a while the Reaper or the grill are the Gleaners the preachers the sons kill teachers the Deacons the elders is going to lay you a little bit of hand full of purpose every once in a while they're going to give you a little revelation and lead them that she may glean them and rebuke her not so she gleaned in the field not in the corner she gleaned in the field until the evening time and she took what she had harvested you got to go beat it out somewhere like me all of us in sanctification you got to go somewhere and you got to beat it out whatever food you get you got to beat it out you come to place where you clap you gotta beat it out man what you're fighting with the devil you fight well that old nature you fight but you gonna what you're gonna beat it out so that you can eat and let her fall some handful to purpose and leave them that she may glean them in rebuke or not and she gleaned in the field until the evening time and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about any path of barley and she took it up and went into the city in other words she's heading back home and her mother-in-law Naomi the Jew saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that head look that's that one more time gave to her that she had reserved after she was finished eating and the mother lost they were in the world did you get all his food right and the mother-in-law said unto her warehouse down between today and we're honest there blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee she don't know it's her kin folks yet you know what the old Orthodox Church is watching us now the old Jews are watching us remember brother Brahim says they think he's coming back for them and he's coming back to get us well that's what's happening the old mother-in-law sale where'd you get this revelation where'd you get all this food through to witnesses they're going to get that food hey man those guards gonna leave us and go them that's why we're at the very end of this thing you're gonna see Naomi she's gonna get the baby that Boaz and Ruth house and the Bible says she becomes the nurse so in other words she becomes the wet nurse she becomes the one that feeds the baby while Naomi and Ruth are out of the picture lots of great what a picture and we may not get to it I'm gonna try to stop it 2:30 and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had rod and said the man's name with him I rocked today is Boaz and Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law let's be he of the Lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living into the dead and the only senator this man is near of Kenan to us one of our next kinsman in other words you know what happened Louise Ruth comes in and lays down what she had got and Naomi says would you get those cars there in Jeremiah forever it isn't where did you get those scars what in other words where did you get all this because she says in the house of my friends and then they always like no that's my near kinsman that's not just somebody out in the field that's my near kinsman that guy can get me out of the trouble I'm in and that's what they're gonna say you know and when we leave through two witnesses they're gonna realize that their bull has come home that their bow ass have took Naomi but in taking Naomi they forgot about Ruth where'd you get those scars in the house and my friends in ruth the moabite a-- said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest and Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter lo it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they may meet the not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of the barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law what a great picture though of Ruth serving are going through sanctification you watch all the thing all the whole process that went through the same thing Abram went through Abram had to go what Abram had to God tells him to bring three Rams and three this and three that and bring this and bring a sacrifice and then he looks at what and it is listen I want you to I was gonna mention this the other day brother Brown preached works his faith expressed now remember just your works alone is not going to do it but if you're working or serving or are heading toward a goal of receiving the baptism the Holy Ghost it is your works because he was looking that Ruth worse he had no history on this girl at all now Naomi yet history cuz it was family like me and brother Danny were not brothers blood but I know Dale and I know Pete and his sister some but more the guys but now don't don't walk up to me and tell me say well now what did Dale do 25 years ago at so-and-so a place I go oh you're not my family go ask Danny Danny could say Dale was so-and-so fishing some 20 and he could tell you the whole story that's what I'm saying with this Sam with you and now it's not that God didn't know who you are but there was a time you were alienated amen I didn't want God to see what I did remember brother mom said there's a there's a what there's a covering of blood all around the world and he only hears your voice cuz if he sees what we done he would have killed us when we were little not little babies I'm talking about when we first started sinning he would have just said I that's it but no he didn't know who you are because you weren't part of his family but once you come into family and if he if you go ask Danny about his brother she did cuz his family they were there same way with what God was there with Israel all the way down through that Old Testament but he had to divorce her to get a Gentile bride because why she went whoring and when she went whoring she took on another husband and he couldn't take her back hey bye okay with that it's a really beautiful beautiful picture so let's go to Ruth chapter three and this is Ruth resting we may get to right here and just stop I'd like to finish it all but we won't have to we just remember what what God's telling us I wanted to read something real quick in Chapter 3 we see Boaz and Ruth finally come together so now what is the third stage of your journey it's when you and Christ come together now remember in the natural story nothing happens fleshly you gotta you got to be careful with your types they didn't become married until just a little bit at the very end of this part all right but watch what happens and I'll read to you what brother Branham talks about mm-hmm here in chapter 3 because you got it really you have to blend chapter 3 and 4 together because like brother Dale's always said like like I've always said there's only three works of grapes so you can't say there's four definite words there's only three justifications think back to them talk about what you do after that is that fourth stage it's the stage so what am I saying that Ruth three and four chapter both kind of blends together but you got to have three first you got to have Boaz doing the work of a kinsman at the end of the chapter after what she does and I love this what she does here I got we got to get into it so look then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter so what because what do we do maybe I just told you in first Corinthians we look back at the Old Testament and see types we look back in the Old Testament the old mother Naomi we look back toward Naomi and get our types to tell us how to deal with things to tell us how to live the ten commandments are in the Old Testament the woman's folks not wear pants is in the Old Testament but y'all be careful when you tell people that unless y'all I send the Old Testament say well 10 commandments is - you'll just do away with the hell you want to do away if yours won't do away with the Old Testament do all of it that's why I always try to trap them I'll if you start your conversation say look you know me you say do you believe in the Ten Commandments oh yeah you ever Christians go so I believe in the Ten Commandments I put them out there my lawn I guess and I them ten commandments there at the voice of God and you just really lay it in and then say and what about Deuteronomy 29 says a woman's not supposed to wear a garment pertain to man they show all that first thing they'll say well that's in the Old Testament and I'll go let's go back about five minutes you so we're gonna do away with a whole Old Testament there's where your Ten Commandments is that so anyway just just comment you kept a at least you get them to thinking but the Old Testament to me is all the beautiful tops because when you get in the New Testament it's us it's Jesus bringing forth my brother Dale so you got John coming at the end of the Old Testament turn introduce Christ and he was the third coming of Elijah then we've had the forthcoming of Elijah come to do what introduced Christ through us to the world so the same type just keeps on going then Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee now look and now is not Boaz of our kindred to watch Naomi all the types and shadows and all the things in the Old Testament the sacrifices and I'm just saying this now not with that but you you know what Naomi's not thinking that but this is what we can think now that Naomi is going hey we've got this rich heritage and I've been separated from it right Naomi's husband was dead she had to sell everything she had Ruth could not connect her back at that point because Ruth had no we listen we as Gentiles had nothing we don't have a promise but Naomi does so naomi has to say look Boaz is our link here and now it's not Boaz of our kindred with whose matings now us in other words out in the field be hold he win with barley tonight in the threshing-floor I love what brother Brown said brother Brown said look Christ is what the Lord of the harvest and when you go to winnow it's in it's in one of these quotes I'll read it maybe well I'll stop here after this and we'll redo it next Sunday and we'll go back on some of these quotes he said there Boaz was he wasn't just Lord of the harvest he was laying on top of the whole harvest cousin he comes to a place he lays down on the threshing floor he probably been working for listen he's been working for 6,000 years you know he's been working but yeah brother Brown says is there said Naomi walk say I mean Ruth walks in and there the Lord of the harvest is laying on the whole harvest in other words he's up on top of the heap he's up on top of the heap he's got it all covered and it looks like a bad thing that Naomi's going to do but it's the most perfect I mean Ruth that's the most perfect thing that Ruth could have done because watch your types we'll get to this real quick and we'll stop right here and now it's not mobile as of our kindred with whose maiden that was behold he went on with barley tonight in the threshing floor washed ourselves therefore in other words come on God get yourself clean you've come in through sanctification you're coming back to the end of sanctification you get ready to rest you're getting ready to let Boaz you're getting ready to let the man do the job but you still got to be clean wash thyself there for an anoint they whoa and put our raiment upon thee in other words don't go in there with a bunch of rags on but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking in other words he's going to be strong he's gonna have eat he's not gonna be hungry he's gonna have drunk drink and it shall be when he lies down this where brother Aaron says he lies down right on top of the whole heap of the harvest because he's the lord of the harvest that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her ain't doing that I ain't going into no abandon and lay down at his feet his feet probably stinks you're telling me to clean up you see what I'm talking about she had to write at it to you she said whatever all the types in the Old Testament all the shadows all the sacrifices all of what we're talking about today she went down she said all that thou sayeth unto me I will do amen can you say that all that you've said to me Lord Old Testament New Testament up to this day will you be able to do what I'm telling you to do how about that brother Brent says he's laying on the whole heap of the harvest now watch where she goes she goes and lays down his his feet now she's not ready to marry him yet get the story she's not laying up there where he's that everybody understand when I'm home out I know we're all men and here you understand she's not she go get into bed with him watch her position her position is humility to lay at a man's feet delay at anybody's feet its humility she shows humility she went down into the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law bathed her in other words she did all the ten commandments she did all the things that that the old Jewish mother told her when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was married he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down now look she wasn't ashamed to do this and he came to pass at midnight brother Graham said it was a dark hour that the man was afraid now this is the natural story of Boaz because you didn't know who she was it stung and behold a woman lay his feet and he said who aren't thou and she answered I am Ruth on handmade spread therefore thy skirt over thy head and handmade for thou art a near kinsman so what's going through Boaz's mind there's a connection here even in the natural story Boaz is like there's a connection here why is she here and not Naomi what's she doing here and not Naomi because Naomi's who I'm kin to but brother brown said he was so in love with her till he took I'm gonna paraphrase it here he through the holy spirit veil over her till he said blessed be the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter in latter day then at the beginning as much as thou follow us not young men where they're poor or rich now my daughter fear not now what's the first thing Jesus says when he comes fear not fear not I'm come to do this I will do to the all that thou requested for all the city of my people don't know that they now look in your Christian journey that's why God's going to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost because look the whole community knows that you've changed the whole community knows that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am thine near kinsman howbeit there's the kinsman near to uh teri this night and it shall be in the more in other words he's saying look you rest you stay right here because you can't do anything about it you have no connection I have the connection now I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to take Naomi's possession but let me tell you something sweetheart Naomi's not going to be my bride you are because I put this Holy Ghost veil over you and you've what your pure your virtuous brother Bryan tells us that we're what the virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ why because he's put that Holy Ghost veil over her and listen what this feat me brother Brahim tells us in about six or eight quotes feet means possession now you say where you going with that I'll go with that and then we're gonna stop I said it stop right here 6:30 so he's gonna do the part of the kinsman do you ever thought of this if footprints means possession he told Abraham wherever you sold your feet that's where you you will possess this land even God tells us in the New Testament I believe it's in Corinthians that blessed are the feet of the ones that carry the gospel so it's always the remember we preach that long time ago about washing the feet Jesus said you don't have no problem if you don't wash feet that's pretty strong but you know why I'm just telling you what God said if you don't wash feet then you got a problem you can't be a servant and not be a servant you can't have Jesus Christ in your life because you become a servant then so watch what this is what did Jesus do when he was taken into Pylos Hall I was thinking about this just a few minutes ago think about this this is the king of the harvest this is the Lord of the whole earth this is the guy that gold doesn't mean anything to him it's pavement but he had to come down in human flesh and be made what into a servant he had to be made into a human being so that he could take what he couldn't take our place as a son of God he couldn't take our place that spirit God he had to become his brother Dale something he had to become human flesh you know what he had he had human feet but those human feet contained God so what happened in pilots Hall they stripped that man of all of his clothes except for a loin cloth so there was this bare feet and as he walked up Gaga's toe this is mine he walks up they put him on a cross his feet was lifted up off the earth but he had walked his little feet had walked right up to that cross in turn not dragging not pulling not stomping he walked right up there and he laid down on that cross and is we're gonna see next Sunday where's lifted up his shoe and he said I have redeemed and then listen to this that man died on the cross for me and you he's blessed feet never touched the ground until the day of the resurrection then he gets out and he stands up in that term and he says now this is mine I've conquered death my feet go all the way up that hill they carried me and put me in a tomb but that can't hold me cuz when I turned myself off of this slap that I'm laying on my feet he's gonna touch the grave and now remember what he says when he steps out he says all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me because my feet walked up that mountain they drove nails through it but now I'm gonna walk out of this tomb so I take death and hell even this poor little bear feet went to hell remember he went to hell went the hell walk then brother brems he walked in hell said hey give me the key what a great Boaz we got that's why Boaz had to take that shoe off because that was possession he bought everything that Naomi had lost and in doing that he got his beautiful Gentile bride let's stand to our feet we'll talk about we'll kind of cover this again next Sunday and we'll read some more quotes but God bless you that to me is one of the prettiest stories of my Redemption I don't know about yours you need to look at this for yourself and you see that that that's why that that man that's why that Ruth had to lay down at his feet because she laid everything she had knowing that that man was going to get up and walk into that town and remember when you see this type we'll see it next Sunday Boaz didn't claim Redemption in the city remember Jesus was crucified outside the city Boaz walks up to the gate of the city what the Bible say it will possess the gates Abraham your royal seed of Abraham will possess the gates of the enemy Boaz walks up and takes his shoe off and he stands there in his bare feet and he says I have done it okay nobody else do it there's a guy here but he don't want nothing to do with him while reading what brother Branham says about that a little bit later on next week but Ruth deciding justification Ruth serving sanctification and then God and the type of the baptism of Holy Ghost she can't get it herself she has to lay down and show her humility and brother Branham says God just throws that Holy Ghost veil over the top of her and says you just hang on right there I got to go do a work for you because you can't get the Holy Ghost for yourself I've got to be here to give it to you so god bless you just read if you want to reap keep reading The Book of Ruth and read the kinsman-redeemer 1960 if you'll read that whole read that whole sermon it'll really tell you a little bit more than what we covered but thank God that the Lord give the inspiration to put that in the Bible cuz it was just a regular book come in though I don't even think they know who wrote it Ruth didn't write it somebody else wrote it but they said hey this is an inspiration and then by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost you and I can see now that it totally tops all four characters is everybody we see the denominational Church going back to the denominations the Gentile bride Boaz Ben Christ and Naomi be in that church over there are that why I say the ortho Church the Jewish Church the God's not gonna forget he's going right through us taking a bride gonna have a child and we're gonna deliver that child right to back to Naomi she's gonna realize though that that child's are when they died for and through not through us personally but through the bride because we're virtuous and all these things that God said about route that Boaz said about Ruth Naomi Naomi the old church is gonna look back and say all that was a virtuous woman and now my Boaz has showed up to take a hundred and forty four thousand of us as he promised us in the Testaments he promised so now here he is oh what a time a lot of time they're gonna cry and screaming and they're gonna just have a like oh how would you believe a man so let's sing a song god bless you god bless you sitting outside for me on the cross of Calvary so every day my heart will praise him I know I'll never be the same all I'm gonna do is love him love is whole leaning again do is love is love yeah a llama she got my wings yet why don't why don't easily have to wait arise some freedom on the cross of Calvary so every day my lord will praise Him I know I'll never be the same all I want to do it's love love his whole think about all those types all I want to do there was a lady named Ruth in the Bible several thousand years ago then she perfectly ties what we're going through what Abram went to be changed Abraham ruling through the same stages and remember at the end there's always a real there's always that reward and that's what we're looking at we're looking at a reward going up that statue of a perfect man oh we got born again right here amen but look at all that this that's this extra look at all that that's mine and yours that's what Ruth gets don't remember when she managed Boaz she got everything bow has God she was right there in line and then that baby they had was named old bad old bad had Jesse Jesse turns around and has David and then that lineage continues right on down the natural lineage to Christ so boy what a story I say I'd love to been there but you know what if I'd have been standing there if I'd have been standing there roofs time I probably wouldn't understood what was going on but I got the full story now we can take all four chapters that could have had that I think it was 10 or 11 years is what the usher said that covers this whole time well we've covered it in about an hour so and we gleaned so much more we got some handfuls of purpose oh I won't buckets full I don't want to get just a little handful I want to be where I can carry it and we're gonna get into next Sunday where she six measures she gets a six fold purpose so we'll get into that next Sunday god bless you love you with the love of the Lord all minds are clear thank you for all coming like I said before now just all the men if you you don't need to get a phone call from me but all the men wants to come from now on that would be fine just make sure we keep just stay away from each other we can't do that that much but yeah we can do that now I believe and stay in the sanctuary and then whatever the we'll look around the community and just pray you pray that that brother Dale myself and anybody that has a suggestion we'd love to hear it but but we need to keep this thing in a good balance so that we don't become we don't draw attention to us because we still listen Jesus told them said give under Caesar what Caesars so we're giving God's once God today we giving Caesar what Caesar is out there so we just want to be safe and we don't want to give the devil any time to play okay but I anybody that wants to come the two services or Sunday and Wednesday but it still holds true on Sunday I'm like brother Dale can't come to both services need let me know I'll if somebody else wants to come but if all the men will come go ahead and come now I do ask you one thing I forgot this like if brother Colley is listening in or brother dartie or any ones that are that are older like that I will if you're gonna come I don't mind you coming but wear a mask wear a mask if you do come all right just to protect everything that we do if not I don't want to disclose the older crowd but we got one over here that's the oldest man in the building so I think since brother dick passed away you're the oldest one period besides the sister we got a couple of sisters so but you know the Lord the Lord's gonna keep us all safe I believe but don't go run out there in the middle of the road don't go right out in front of the tractor-trailer it be your time and you and you made it right so that's just it bro Danny's always this is nothing new to brother Danny I before since he got sick back years ago and fell off the chicken house he's washed his hands that Joker washing his hands when he washed his hands he would keep washing his hands I can't do it for 20s that's the longest 20 seconds in the world they tell you now to wash your hands for 20 seconds Oh Lord I think two seconds is about all I get you know but 20 seconds but brother Danny's always done it you always had hand sanitizer so he he's kind of used to it but let's all do that do the right thing and pray pray every day that God give us wisdom in all this okay all right let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father thank you for this day that we've been given we do praise your great name for the things that you've let us glean Lord you've told us what field you've made yourself known you've revealed yourself that hey I'm Boaz and this is my field the message of the hour is to feel that we should be in father and I pray Lord that all of us as Ruth would glean in that field and there would be buckets full of purpose be given to each one of us Lord be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us Lord be with the ones that are that are out there in the world that are suffering father we pray that you would save their soul number one Lord but number two would you Lord give them comfort in their body father just forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord keep our pastor healthy Lord keep this building strong Lord just keep that Holy Ghost Vail as you as you threw that over now I'm over Ruth there in the Bible Lord we pray that you'll throw that thing over us Lord that Holy Ghost Vail that'll keep us and that we can stand in the end time as brother nails talking about going toward the son of man the son of man being prevalent and that's you being in human flesh Lord being the prevalent one in this endtime father so that we can take a body change and get out of here that's our top of the mountain that's our peak that's our barley harvest that's all of the things that you showed us in tight Lord and then through Abraham being changed and so does Sarah be changed Lord we pray for that change number one change on the inside and number two change on the outside Father give us this day our daily bread be with us on the highways on the way home that we return back on Wednesday bless brother Aaron Lord give him strength be with each one Lord it's outside give them strength and courage father to meet the challenge of the day in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you you're dismissed [Music]
