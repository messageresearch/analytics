[7:51] amen I was thinking yesterday man what
[7:55] would it
[7:57] be get everybody all back together again
[8:00] Revelations 1:10 says I was in the
[8:02] spirit on the Lord's day and I heard
[8:03] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[8:06] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[8:07] and the last and what thou see us write
[8:09] in a book and send it to the seven
[8:11] churches I'm not going to read them you
[8:13] know where they are we're now in the
[8:15] speaking of the Philadelphian Church age
[8:17] heading toward the layout of sin and I
[8:20] turned to see the voice that spake with
[8:22] me I remember John heard a voice that
[8:25] sounded like a trumpet now listen you
[8:27] and I have had the trumpet sound in this
[8:31] day we should have heard the
[8:36] voice specific to me and you that's what
[8:39] we're going to get into Leia specific to
[8:41] me and you it's okay to listen to Luther
[8:43] it's okay to listen to Wesley which we
[8:45] can't listen to them you understand what
[8:46] I mean but we can read their writings
[8:48] and the things that happen like we're
[8:49] talking about now but unless we hear the
[8:51] voice of God for our day then we're
[8:54] behind and God's never behind he's
[8:56] always moving forward all
[8:58] right and I turned to see the voice that
[9:00] spake with me and being turned I saw
[9:02] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[9:04] midst of the seven candlesticks one
[9:06] liken to the son of man clothed with a
[9:07] garment down to the foot G about the
[9:09] paps with a golden girdle or read a
[9:11] couple of scriptures and he can be
[9:12] seated Revelations 3:7 to the angel of
[9:15] the church in Philadelphia right these
[9:17] things say he that is Holy he that is
[9:19] true we're going to talk about that
[9:20] today he that ha the key of David he
[9:23] that openeth and no man shutteth and
[9:25] shutteth and no man open this you may be
[9:27] seated we'll read the rest of it a
[9:28] little bit later
[9:31] but as we were talking Wednesday night
[9:33] we've come to a we've come to a place
[9:35] now that we're getting closer to the
[9:38] history that you and I can understand
[9:41] everybody with me I mean we're coming
[9:43] down here to where we're looking at at
[9:45] Luther and Wesley and we have seen them
[9:48] we know we see their writings their
[9:50] writings are in books I don't know if
[9:52] Columba has a writing or I know Paul did
[9:54] he wrote part of the Bible but irenius
[9:56] never had a um you know a library
[9:59] that we could go read but now we do have
[10:01] one for John Wesley and Martin Luther
[10:04] and the reason is that is because it's
[10:07] now the man anointing are the
[10:10] spiritual Information Age just as this
[10:14] is the natural Information Age all right
[10:17] and we've come to the place now to where
[10:19] you know you got everything on your on
[10:21] your arm now you got your Apple watches
[10:23] and all these different things that you
[10:25] can U that you can get your information
[10:27] off of where back then they had to
[10:30] listen to a sermon I think sometimes we
[10:32] get a
[10:33] little um lazy I guess maybe is well we
[10:36] don't have to listen to that if we fall
[10:37] asleep we'll just you know listen it to
[10:39] it tomorrow or or watch it online but
[10:42] they didn't have a chance to do that
[10:43] they had to hang on every word that
[10:45] Luther and Wesley said and even
[10:48] Pentecost even isza Street and different
[10:50] ones not until we got brother brandham
[10:53] not until we got to the 1947 1948 coming
[10:57] out of the war did they develop a thing
[10:59] called a recording device and that we
[11:02] could hear truly the voice of God for
[11:04] the end time so we are a privileged
[11:07] group of people but remember more is
[11:10] given more is required so more is given
[11:13] to us than any other age more is
[11:15] required but brother John we got an open
[11:19] book though we know the answer to the
[11:21] questions we have the things that as
[11:24] we're going to talk to a minute in a
[11:26] minute about an unfulfilled age this age
[11:28] is not an unfulfilled age Martin
[11:31] Luther's age was an unfulfilled age
[11:33] because he couldn't get everything
[11:34] correct like the prophet of God did in
[11:37] the end time thank God for this message
[11:39] of the
[11:41] hour and let me let me let you in on a
[11:43] little secret it doesn't matter to me
[11:45] who it came
[11:49] from it came through the man God wanted
[11:51] it to come through and no one
[11:53] else but listen to The Voice don't worry
[11:57] about the man listen to The Voice the
[11:59] the Bible says you listen to what the
[12:01] spirit says to the churches all right
[12:04] and we got it in tape and book form and
[12:05] I know that but listen so that God can
[12:08] talk to you not brother randam talk to
[12:10] you that's God's voice for the end time
[12:13] and when brother Bob stands here brother
[12:15] Aaron Brother Louise different Minister
[12:17] stands here that's the voice of God
[12:18] speaking to you in the end time and
[12:21] you're able to process it
[12:25] different than Martin Luther different
[12:28] than John Wesley
[12:30] because we have the true anointing or
[12:32] the eagle anointing or we have the truth
[12:35] totally we are a fulfill age we look
[12:38] pretty horrible now I don't say we the
[12:40] bride but it looks horrible out there
[12:42] but we the bride we're right on time we
[12:44] know what we're doing we know where
[12:46] we're at where we're at we know I was
[12:48] talking to brother Chris we were
[12:50] speaking about what he had went over for
[12:52] the weekend cuz we went back down to
[12:54] brother Barry's on thurs or brother
[12:55] Barry's on Thursday when he passed and
[12:58] it it's just a you can't I wish you
[13:01] could drill a hole in people's head and
[13:03] pour it in but you can't you've got to
[13:06] be a receptor you've got to be able to
[13:09] receive the message for your day and
[13:11] without the new birth you cannot receive
[13:14] the message of your day you can hear it
[13:17] you can try to act on it a little bit
[13:19] but you cannot
[13:20] be the message of the hour you have to
[13:24] be the message of the hour right
[13:27] everybody with me amen all right so we
[13:30] now we come to that church
[13:32] age that's
[13:34] Philadelphia it's in the man anointing
[13:37] remember as we were talking about
[13:37] Wednesday night a dominating female has
[13:40] always always took over the church and
[13:44] always destroyed the works of God or
[13:47] tried to destroy the works of God all
[13:49] right it is not for a female to speak
[13:52] our us Authority as Paul says cuz he
[13:54] knew the ruination of many people was a
[13:57] woman the ruin of Solomon was women the
[14:01] ruination of different ones even Samson
[14:04] was a woman there was a woman involved
[14:06] and we said before and dad spoke it many
[14:09] many years ago me all the wars that ever
[14:11] started and was ever fought was usually
[14:15] there was a woman tied up somewhere or
[14:17] involved in something going on well same
[14:20] thing with the
[14:21] church we can't let the church dominate
[14:25] us that's right hello somebody you can't
[14:28] let the church Church you can't let this
[14:30] message Church dominate
[14:32] you CU there's things in the message
[14:35] that are not of God false Doctrine is
[14:39] not of God it is not part of the
[14:42] headstone it is not part of the message
[14:44] of the hour oh it's people hanging
[14:47] around the camps that's why we've got to
[14:49] be precise and I love people like
[14:51] brother Mike and brother Chris they're
[14:53] precise in what they bring and they
[14:55] bring something with Clarity and if you
[14:56] didn't understand anything this weekend
[14:58] understand understand one
[15:00] thing it's
[15:02] close it ain't far
[15:04] off there's one or two little things
[15:06] that we're missing not missing but we're
[15:09] missing at that I believe when we get
[15:10] those things straightened up brother
[15:11] Bown said remember when we realize who
[15:14] we are yes and what we're doing here
[15:16] we're not com to just get we didn't come
[15:19] to get our good clothes on and come to
[15:20] church today and wonder what's going to
[15:23] happen that's right you got to make it
[15:26] happen you got to say Amen you got to
[15:29] say praise the Lord you got to be ready
[15:31] for the
[15:32] service individually we must be ready
[15:35] for the things that God's going to bring
[15:36] us if not we will absolutely miss
[15:40] it let's don't miss
[15:43] it let's get out of here with
[15:46] it so remember the opening of the seals
[15:49] we're going to get back to this when we
[15:50] get into brother Bam's Ministry but
[15:52] those seals opened in their natural form
[15:56] during the time of we know it's it's
[15:58] there's a natural and a spiritual point
[16:00] there was a white righteous Church
[16:02] listen that white righteous church is
[16:03] still here right Catholic church it's a
[16:07] white righteous church that began in
[16:09] that age and comes to this age all right
[16:11] the're red listen they're not killing
[16:13] they're they almost killed President
[16:15] Trump yesterday about three inches over
[16:18] and he wouldn't be
[16:19] here but you take that and you know what
[16:22] they'll use
[16:24] that I like what brother Mike said think
[16:27] about that
[16:30] deadly wound
[16:32] healed we might think it was a pope but
[16:34] we may be a little
[16:36] surprised where the Superman comes
[16:38] from but you take these ages and you
[16:41] bring them up and you see that each one
[16:43] was a loosing of a Ministry so there was
[16:45] a loosing of a white righteous church
[16:46] and it's still going on there was a
[16:48] loosing of red they were killing
[16:50] physically back there but remember
[16:51] brother R said you kill a man you kill
[16:53] his influence so you've killed him
[16:55] spiritually over here and Satan is
[16:57] killing us spiritually if we don't wreck
[16:58] wake
[17:01] up there's been a true Ministry loose
[17:04] though in every age to combat the fal
[17:07] and actually it went out first amen
[17:11] Satan is not an originator Satan is a
[17:14] pretender or he comes back behind God
[17:17] and tries to pervert so when that white
[17:19] horse rode out there was somebody
[17:21] standing there called a lion of the
[17:24] tribe of Judah one of the four Beast
[17:26] that said hey John come and see
[17:30] and what do he
[17:33] see what do he see you saw a white
[17:35] righteous church right out because it
[17:38] was a white righteous Church on on the
[17:39] earth at that time under Paul irenius
[17:42] and Martin different ones right then the
[17:45] fourth Church age Satan said I'm going
[17:47] to just start killing them I can't
[17:49] hardly get them all sometime spiritually
[17:50] so I'm going to just kill them
[17:52] physically so that second beast was the
[17:54] ox it was Labor they labored through
[17:57] that church age and it was red and power
[18:00] was given he was given a sword so now
[18:02] he's given a word to to deceive the
[18:04] People by all right so as we move on up
[18:08] the fifth and sixth Church age which
[18:10] will be the one we're talking about now
[18:11] the fifth and the sixth five would be
[18:13] Luther and and sixth would be Wesley
[18:16] that third Beast a man says come and see
[18:18] and then a black horse rode out and he
[18:21] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[18:22] in his hand listen I want to tell you
[18:24] something about the message of the hour
[18:26] when you hear somebody preaching
[18:28] different things you better find the
[18:30] balance of the two there is a balance
[18:33] and I know people hate George Smith and
[18:36] you're going to see him Friday cuz he's
[18:37] coming he'll pull his ruler out and
[18:40] he'll lay her right here on the pull pit
[18:42] and he ain't trying to figure out
[18:43] whether the pull Pit's level or not he
[18:46] says we got to have balance in the
[18:48] message and that's true we got to have
[18:50] the balance of the message of the hour
[18:52] CU if you cater one way or the other you
[18:54] got to come back to zero to balance out
[18:57] so that's what we're doing now we're
[18:58] trying our best to to not bring a new
[19:00] sword we're not bringing a new word but
[19:02] let's sharpen what we have let's let
[19:05] that thing cut where it should
[19:08] cut so the fifth and sixth Ages which
[19:11] we're finished one now we're into the
[19:12] other one we see that fourth the third
[19:15] Beast was a man which is intelligent
[19:18] smart shrewd brother B says all right so
[19:21] we're going to start back just over
[19:23] because I want to come back to one thing
[19:24] I want to talk about that I missed with
[19:26] Martin Luther's age and he was regarded
[19:28] is the most influential figure in
[19:31] Christian history why he was like Moses
[19:33] like I said Wednesday night he actually
[19:36] literally he bed at a system that ruled
[19:39] everything in the
[19:41] world and he was actually in that system
[19:44] sir and he come out of that system and
[19:47] said they're wrong the 95 thesis and God
[19:51] had to protect him God had to keep him
[19:53] alive because they wanted to kill him
[19:55] the Catholic Church yeah the Catholic
[19:56] church if y'all don't understand the
[19:58] Catholic Church they have Jesuits and
[20:00] they have their own little FBI and come
[20:02] on people we ain't
[20:04] stupid but now he come out with a with a
[20:07] saying of the just shall live by faith
[20:10] as we were covering Wednesday night
[20:12] you've got to see that you have by faith
[20:14] been Justified not because you come to
[20:17] not I've got 10 year brother been here
[20:19] 45 years I don't mean nothing to God
[20:23] remember God's Not A Time
[20:25] creature God's not going to ever ask you
[20:27] how long did it take you to become a
[20:28] Christian he knows how long cuz he's in
[20:30] eternity standing there waiting on you
[20:32] to come to him all right but no man is
[20:34] justified by the law now remember the
[20:36] law was what dos and don'ts we read all
[20:39] that you do this you die you do this you
[20:41] live you do this you die all right then
[20:44] Grace had to come in because the just
[20:46] shall live by faith or by grace are you
[20:50] saved through faith all right so it's
[20:53] the grace of God that did it but
[20:55] remember there's one thing we're going
[20:56] to cover right here in just a second
[20:58] they were reformers they could not bring
[21:01] everything together Martin Luther had a
[21:03] good message John Wesley had a wonderful
[21:05] message and many people were saved
[21:08] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[21:10] Ghost during their powerful powerful
[21:13] Holy Ghost message but it didn't perfect
[21:16] the people to the place God wants them
[21:18] perfected
[21:21] to right God requires Perfection be
[21:25] therefore perfect now he didn't say be
[21:28] therefore fulfilled he said be therefore
[21:31] perfect so it was a little green shoes
[21:34] and God was so happy with that even the
[21:35] two cuz remember he said I will restore
[21:38] he had he had planted that seed in the
[21:40] ground there after NAA in the Dark Ages
[21:43] and then God was happy to see those two
[21:45] shoots pop up he was happy with Martin
[21:48] Luther even all Martin Luther's
[21:50] fallacies he was happy with that because
[21:52] he was doing something God told him to
[21:55] do how we going to be happy do what God
[21:58] told us to do that's right well I don't
[22:01] think stop right
[22:03] there take that eye part out that's
[22:05] right you're you're in trouble when you
[22:07] say I think or I it ain't what we think
[22:11] it's what God
[22:12] Said So the two shoots that signified
[22:15] the truth was coming back now remember
[22:17] the truth wasn't there totally the truth
[22:19] was coming back CU remember God is a
[22:21] dispensationalist God does things in
[22:24] what
[22:25] progression be you know why he does that
[22:28] for me and you he's already perfect he's
[22:31] already he don't need that he but we do
[22:34] he knew we were humans he knew that we
[22:36] would come under an education system
[22:38] where we would start kindergarten and go
[22:39] all the way to to wherever you want to
[22:41] go into your into your education he knew
[22:43] we'd need that so he he took the word of
[22:47] God and he put it in the same
[22:49] way doesn't the Bible tell us that the
[22:52] godhead can be seen can be understood by
[22:54] the things we what see or understand the
[22:57] things we understand understand I can
[22:59] see how God's one but have many
[23:01] manifestations I'm one there's not two
[23:03] or three in me I'm one but they have
[23:05] many
[23:06] manifestation but the world don't even
[23:08] see that they say nope there's
[23:13] three so the truth was coming back as it
[23:16] was known at Pentecost was the doctrine
[23:18] of justification look salvation by grace
[23:21] apart from works as we were talking
[23:23] Wednesday night but remember our
[23:26] justification gets a start Ed into
[23:29] getting born again their justification
[23:31] their requirement was was to believe
[23:36] that the just shall live by faith not by
[23:39] Penance that was a listen that was a
[23:41] revelation we can call it baby form all
[23:44] we want to it was the fullness for them
[23:46] at the time amen we can call it whatever
[23:49] we want to but that was the power of God
[23:51] in the people to cleanse them save them
[23:55] sanctify them and actually give them the
[23:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost just like you
[23:58] you got but remember God moves on he
[24:01] requires Perfection he Winks at the
[24:02] ignorance of the people and then he
[24:04] moves forward because he knows we're
[24:06] human beings but he does set another
[24:08] person in place called John Wesley so
[24:11] he's moving on he's moving on up John
[24:13] Wesley takes s takes justification puts
[24:16] it with sanctification and said that's
[24:18] it well then God moves on God says no
[24:21] you got to go to the gifts you got to go
[24:22] get receive the Holy Ghost and then you
[24:24] got to go on to what the word of God
[24:26] being brought back in power which will
[24:27] get to a little bit later on but
[24:29] salvation by grace apart from Works he
[24:32] will ever forever be known as the
[24:34] instrument in the hand of God now watch
[24:35] instrument in the hand of God who
[24:37] revived this truth he was the fifth
[24:39] messenger and his message was the just
[24:41] shall live by faith now it's been called
[24:44] period of reformation so he was not able
[24:46] to lead the church back to the whole
[24:48] truth as would Paul and listen now
[24:51] that's Alpha but as was Omega William
[24:54] brandham restoring the full word by the
[24:56] full word was here went the ground the
[24:58] middle age now it's coming back here you
[25:00] and I are sitting under the full word of
[25:03] God and we'll get to that this afternoon
[25:05] I'll read it to you where brother R
[25:06] talks about how that Hagar and Sarah and
[25:10] Mary all typed of different things and
[25:12] we'll get into it this afternoon because
[25:14] remember Mary was not the seed Mary was
[25:18] a carrier of the seed Mary Tau Pentecost
[25:22] is what we're getting into now not
[25:23] saying they weren't true but she didn't
[25:25] have the seed she had to be given seed
[25:28] yes
[25:29] that's why I want to talk to that if
[25:31] y'all catch what brother Mike ALK said
[25:33] the other day you'll you'll understand
[25:35] about that about people talking about
[25:36] the seed he talks about the seed but he
[25:38] said but you weren't Eternal see there
[25:41] was nothing Eternal in you you come to
[25:44] that but that seed has always been
[25:45] Eternal the mind of God's always been
[25:47] Eternal he can't change his mind so yes
[25:50] there is
[25:51] representation for you at your birth
[25:54] when you were born God knew you'd come
[25:56] to this age he knew you'd want the Holy
[25:57] Ghost and he had it there for you he
[26:00] didn't give it to you when you were a
[26:01] baby come on Mary did not have seed in
[26:06] her when she was born she had to receive
[26:09] seed Sarah had to receive seed you
[26:13] sisters had to receive seed to have
[26:14] children you didn't come with all that
[26:16] and who are we we're the
[26:19] bride right we're the bride we have to
[26:21] receive seed and then all that life
[26:24] comes together and then that happens
[26:26] that there's a blossoming but God knew
[26:28] that before the foundation of the world
[26:30] had it already ready for you but it
[26:32] didn't make you Eternal at your birth at
[26:35] your sorry your natural
[26:37] birth it did at your spiritual birth but
[26:40] not at your natural
[26:43] birth they can say all these things
[26:45] about laying dormant I eternal life to
[26:47] me is not dormant so you either got it
[26:49] or you don't that's right it's just to
[26:51] me it's cut and dry either gu or you
[26:52] don't and the Bible says you
[26:55] don't the Bible says you got to be born
[26:57] again what being born again the seed of
[26:59] God coming into your soul and quickening
[27:02] yeah quickening the word that you hold
[27:04] in your heart you did not get born again
[27:08] out in the backside of a desert
[27:09] Somewhere listening to nobody but your
[27:12] brain I'll promise you you ain't Born
[27:17] Again seed life has to come through the
[27:19] body seed life has to come through the
[27:22] body somebody has to talk to you and
[27:25] expound to you why did the people at at
[27:27] Corinth didn't re receive the Holy Ghost
[27:30] they were preaching Jesus Christ read
[27:32] your book of Acts but it took somebody
[27:33] like Paul or Peter to come with the
[27:36] quickening power come on somebody that's
[27:39] why we need the quickening power in our
[27:42] services the quickening power to Quicken
[27:45] those that are not born
[27:47] again right and it comes from a message
[27:49] it comes from this the seed life has to
[27:52] come through the body yes sir I'll get
[27:54] off of that but it's the truth anyhow
[27:58] listen the word of God is always right
[28:00] we can't interpret it different we can
[28:03] take quotes just like I was um um kind
[28:06] of the other day studying a little bit
[28:08] on Daniel 70 weeks
[28:09] again and I talked to brother Claude the
[28:11] other day and we were we were kind of
[28:13] chuckling about it but you know people
[28:15] can take quotes and they they'll take
[28:18] quotes and throw the Bible
[28:19] away you can't do
[28:22] that you got to make the quote fit the
[28:25] Bible not the Bible fit the quote right
[28:28] or take a quote outside of the context
[28:30] of the Bible all right so the Bible says
[28:34] that there's three periods of Daniel 70
[28:36] weeks a 7 week a 62 week and a one week
[28:39] that adds up to
[28:40] 70 don't give me these quotes I know
[28:43] what brother R saying do you he can't do
[28:46] more than the Bible we've got to take
[28:48] everything brother R said fa's final
[28:50] resting place is not in William brandom
[28:52] sir face final resting places in the
[28:54] word of God Quicken to your heart and
[28:57] that will absolutely say that ain't
[28:59] nothing but the truth like what hady
[29:01] Wright said listen it changed two
[29:04] people's life when she quit that was
[29:06] Quicken to Hur than
[29:08] it you want your children saved get in
[29:12] the message with fervor and say God that
[29:13] ain't nothing but the truth and one day
[29:16] he'll drop down in your heart and he
[29:17] says what do you
[29:20] want don't think that that had right the
[29:22] only one the third listen we are third
[29:25] pull
[29:26] people we're third po people people
[29:28] we're going to have to start speaking it
[29:31] to make it happen not wait till it
[29:32] happens and then say oh I was thinking
[29:35] that yeah right so is the devil remember
[29:38] the devil is an
[29:40] afterthought God's thoughts are
[29:44] Eternal do you know what the meaning of
[29:46] not perfect really is it's unfulfilled
[29:49] talking about the sardian church age
[29:51] we'll get
[29:51] to just a second but I went up and
[29:54] looked up the word
[29:56] unfulfilled the word un fulfill means
[29:58] not carried out or brought to completion
[30:03] so the new birth for them was that what
[30:06] it was but it was not taken to
[30:09] completion they could not take a body
[30:12] change with what Martin Luther had but
[30:14] God was happy with what Martin Luther
[30:16] was doing all right and I to this
[30:19] afternoon we're going to look at
[30:20] sanctification I want to bring out
[30:22] something a little different in
[30:23] sanctification because remember
[30:25] sanctifica justification is a definite
[30:30] work boom sir you come from siner to all
[30:36] that past sin yes sir done away with
[30:40] boom amen but sanctification is not a
[30:43] boom sanctification is a microwave no
[30:46] it's an oven it's like campfire it takes
[30:50] a long time but as we in Wednesday night
[30:53] it takes a while for those demons to get
[30:54] all pushed out if you had only one demon
[30:57] to worry with you all be in good
[30:59] shape well praise L pray for me then I
[31:01] got more than
[31:02] one he
[31:09] sometimes we all have our demons but we
[31:11] all have to get them cast
[31:14] out you say well I've been a I've been
[31:16] born
[31:17] again we're talking a different
[31:20] sanctification then but the first part
[31:22] of your Sanctified life is is you got to
[31:24] get cleaned up you got to get cleaned up
[31:28] up yes right now listen the first thing
[31:30] is you have nothing to do with
[31:32] justification I'm going to stop here
[31:33] just a minute you have nothing to do
[31:35] with justification except believing what
[31:37] he's already done absolutely now
[31:40] remember a pardon is not a pardon until
[31:42] it's accepted as a pardon I'll get to
[31:44] that in just a
[31:45] second but sanctification is a work it's
[31:49] a work it's a WIP it's a work in
[31:52] progress remember justification he picks
[31:55] it up and said I'm going to use it you
[31:57] go s ification he still got to get that
[31:59] thing clean and it may not get clean the
[32:01] first
[32:04] time you know whose problem that is
[32:08] yours cuz you love that one and you'll
[32:10] bring your right back
[32:13] in that's why there ain't too many new
[32:15] births brother B says many times back in
[32:17] the 60s there's not many true new births
[32:20] there's a lot of sanctification there's
[32:22] a lot of justification but
[32:24] sanctification listen them things I used
[32:26] to do I don't do them no more that's
[32:28] right they bother me but they butt up
[32:32] against me they don't grab me and take
[32:33] me
[32:35] out take me out like I used to go out
[32:38] right so unfulfilled age is not carried
[32:41] out or brought to completion not having
[32:43] fully utilized or exploited one's
[32:46] abilities or
[32:48] character now that was justification we
[32:51] must believe that God forgave us of our
[32:53] sins we must believe in the grace of God
[32:56] but that's that just G isue
[33:00] started as I was telling them down that
[33:02] brother when brother Barry passed away I
[33:05] said folks this is not an
[33:07] end this is the beginning of his life
[33:11] this is the beginning this is this has
[33:13] red back to before the foundation of the
[33:16] world if you look at it that way then
[33:18] praise
[33:19] God he just began his life brother Dale
[33:22] you say oh he did all this great things
[33:23] and yes he did but he did not begin his
[33:25] life until the other day
[33:28] he didn't begin his eternal part of him
[33:30] that was before the foundation of the
[33:32] world until just the other
[33:33] day he fulfilled that and God said I'm
[33:36] taking him home all right devil didn't
[33:39] have anything to do with
[33:41] that he had nothing to do with brother
[33:43] Barry either God took him when he needed
[33:45] to take him he was tired and ready to
[33:49] go anybody ever said God don't make a
[33:52] mistake he never
[33:54] does if you believe you're one of his
[33:57] yeah he never makes a mistake we know he
[33:59] never makes a mistake but if you believe
[34:01] he's one you're one of his whatever move
[34:03] is made is for your good whatever move
[34:06] is made in your life as brother Bob was
[34:08] talking about Job listen job didn't have
[34:10] the new
[34:11] birth job didn't have the Holy Ghost in
[34:14] his soul right he had an anointing of
[34:16] the Old Testament of the blood of bulls
[34:18] and goats and you see what kind of you
[34:20] what kind of attitude he had he wasn't
[34:23] no wowy W you was
[34:26] me though God slay me yet I'll trust
[34:30] him I know my redeemer liveth and I'll
[34:33] Stand in the last days in my flesh what
[34:36] a revelation without the new
[34:40] birth have you considered my servant
[34:46] joob but I will restore the first three
[34:50] ages had the pure word of God they
[34:52] didn't have to restore they heard it
[34:53] from the from the one himself but that
[34:55] one himself had to die and go into
[34:57] ground is everybody with me Jesus Christ
[34:59] had to die and go on the ground he set a
[35:01] corn of Wheat and I'll read it just a
[35:02] minute set a corn of wheat go on the
[35:04] ground and die about us alone but if it
[35:06] comes back what it starts growing it
[35:08] went 120 on the day of Pentecost and
[35:10] they had the pure word of God up until
[35:11] man started getting involved and started
[35:13] pulling it to Pieces all right everybody
[35:16] with me so the first three ages had the
[35:18] pure word of God the fourth age it went
[35:21] back into the ground again because he
[35:23] said in Joel I will restore what was eat
[35:27] right
[35:28] Jesus said the hour is come that the son
[35:30] of man should be glorified verely I say
[35:32] unto you ascept a corn of wheat fall
[35:33] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[35:36] I was thinking about that when brother
[35:37] Bob was speaking you look at the people
[35:39] the great people of Faith you would
[35:42] think God never protected a one of
[35:46] them Paul head chopped
[35:49] off
[35:51] Peter upside down
[35:53] crucifixion James and the different ones
[35:56] you read all of them read where all 12
[35:58] of them got killed they didn't make it
[36:00] except John John's the only one that
[36:01] made it to an old age one of them got
[36:04] pulled
[36:05] apart one of them got saw I mean um
[36:08] Chopped with a sword cut in
[36:11] pieces Christians Born Again people that
[36:15] carry the
[36:19] gospel listen we don't figure out God
[36:22] but remember he don't make a mistake but
[36:25] he said by suffering are we going to
[36:27] learn these things you know why because
[36:30] he knows we're human beings and we are
[36:33] now in the ly and age and we're
[36:38] soft need our AC need our
[36:43] heat need our cars that drive theel
[36:45] that's not too bad but
[36:51] anyway all who live Godly in Christ
[36:55] shall suffer pers
[36:58] ution if our Lord and
[37:01] savior suffered so much them whole 33
[37:04] years he was alive he suffered the whole
[37:07] time nobody liked him nobody understood
[37:09] him nobody wanted him and then look what
[37:12] happened when when he came back on the
[37:13] day of Pentecost got into a man named
[37:15] Paul they stoned him everywhere he went
[37:17] they stoned
[37:19] him you said boy I don't know if I want
[37:21] to be a Christian or not remember this
[37:24] life is but a vapor come on this life is
[37:28] just getting you ready to get to the
[37:30] next
[37:31] part we are Eternal people inside of us
[37:35] that have come down here in time what to
[37:38] prove
[37:39] God to show that tragedy doesn't destroy
[37:42] us tragedy makes a Believer who they are
[37:46] it made job who he was for eternity will
[37:48] NE will always remember job we'll always
[37:51] remember the ones that that suffered
[37:53] yeah not not them that they suffered the
[37:55] bad things but we remember the good part
[37:57] of all this the good part that came out
[37:59] of whatever we lost or whatever we
[38:01] didn't lose or whatever we had and
[38:03] whatever we didn't
[38:04] have the Bible says all things will be
[38:07] made new do we go are we going to
[38:08] believe that this present suffering Paul
[38:12] said the present
[38:13] suffering has not even compared to the
[38:16] glory that will be revealed in us the
[38:18] glory that we're heading
[38:20] to but yet we let our job we let our
[38:23] family we let all this stuff get in the
[38:25] way that's right
[38:28] put God first amen but he's going to
[38:31] restore all these years he promised he
[38:33] would and who are we are the end of that
[38:37] restoration you and I are the end of
[38:40] that to be restored back to the faith of
[38:42] the fathers ain't that what Malachi 4
[38:44] says he's going to return the hearts of
[38:46] the children back to the fathers and
[38:47] fathers back to the children right we're
[38:51] back to here and we're going to what
[38:52] we're going to come to maturity in this
[38:55] age because that plant's growing
[38:58] it's growing now whether you believe it
[39:00] or not you can take round up all you
[39:02] want to and spray over
[39:04] it it will produce a crop that's right
[39:08] and I believe I'm looking at
[39:09] it and you shall eat in plenty and be
[39:12] satisfied and praise the name of the
[39:13] Lord your God he dealt wondrously with
[39:16] you and my people shall never be
[39:19] ashamed the present suffering of this
[39:21] time will not be compared to the things
[39:25] that's coming to the things that you
[39:27] wouldn't no nobody in this room or
[39:29] anybody in the world would ever bring
[39:31] anybody back that's already going to the
[39:33] other
[39:34] side oh yeah there's a void there oh
[39:38] yeah it's not going to be it's going to
[39:39] be a new normal but it's happened since
[39:42] the dawn of
[39:43] time we've got a cycle of all this stuff
[39:46] and I I I just believe somebody is going
[39:48] to break that cycle somebody's going to
[39:51] destroy death but it's going to take
[39:53] somebody that's not somebody that's
[39:55] perfect in their own self
[39:58] but you're perfect in Christ you're
[40:00] perfect in Christ you do what he says
[40:02] and you catch the revelation of what's
[40:04] going on which is a progressive
[40:06] revelation as we saw in the Book of
[40:07] Ezekiel ankles knees loin and head
[40:09] there's your four the four life
[40:11] Messengers brought it back four death
[40:13] Messengers eat it down we are now in you
[40:15] and I are in the fourth if you got the
[40:18] Holy Ghost today you've got to the loins
[40:20] but remember thee we got to be able to
[40:23] swim in this gospel that we're talking
[40:24] about now not be babies where every
[40:27] little thing we run all over the place
[40:28] and and and we oh throw our hands
[40:33] up that's right help
[40:36] us you got to change your stinking
[40:40] thinking have the mind of Christ what
[40:42] would Jesus do you
[40:44] know so the fifth days and the sixth
[40:46] days were
[40:47] reformers God was pleased there was a
[40:49] piece of part of their time that they
[40:51] had and God was pleased with that
[40:54] Amen brother tell us the last three
[40:56] Church AG just forms a complete birth so
[40:58] we come to what the woman has has water
[41:01] blood and life all right but now
[41:03] remember it's water blood in life to get
[41:06] you
[41:10] here then you got to
[41:13] grow that's your fourth stage is the
[41:16] word of God helping you to grow into an
[41:19] adult that's what sanctification does
[41:22] that's what the second part of
[41:23] sanctification in the statute of perfect
[41:25] man we've been talking about it you have
[41:27] to be what washed daily you have to Die
[41:29] daily some of those demons are going to
[41:31] try to come back they can't get in your
[41:33] soul but they sure can play in your
[41:34] spirit realm but you you got to know how
[41:37] to handle it you got to be mature to be
[41:39] able to say that ain't going to happen
[41:41] to me no more you've used that tactic
[41:43] Satan one more time and now I know who
[41:46] you are now I know why you're coming and
[41:49] I'm going to absolutely put a shield up
[41:51] I'm going to say God I we were talking
[41:54] about something the other
[41:55] day we got a prophet came in the end
[41:57] time right he came to bring us the word
[42:00] of God he came to bring us the perfect
[42:03] word of
[42:06] God perfect inspiration Divine
[42:09] interpretation right we believe that
[42:11] don't we they come up to him one day and
[42:13] there questions and answers they said
[42:15] brother
[42:17] brandom I've got a I've got a stingy
[42:21] spirit and I'm sure they were all
[42:23] sitting on the edge of their seat
[42:25] getting ready for a um something out of
[42:28] the
[42:29] Bible getting ready for some
[42:32] Revelation that how to get rid of being
[42:38] stingy brother Ram didn't open his
[42:41] Bible what'd he
[42:43] say he said do the
[42:46] opposite who do the
[42:50] opposite but that's the hardest thing
[42:52] for us to
[42:53] do if you're stingy brother R said if
[42:55] you're stingy start giving money away
[42:58] if you're tired of being sick and tired
[42:59] quit being sick and tired if you're sick
[43:02] and tired you're not on God's ground
[43:03] you're on the Devil's Ground so you know
[43:05] that so get over on God's ground that's
[43:08] right do the vice versa he said most
[43:11] people didn't understand what he said
[43:13] but I just said make sure you do the
[43:16] opposite well I can't get up start
[43:19] getting
[43:25] up so justification look it eradicates
[43:28] by faith in what Christ did at the cross
[43:31] the sins of your past nature everybody
[43:34] with me doesn't destroy the man it just
[43:37] chopped off that past sin that you did
[43:40] turns you white not on the inside but
[43:43] white in God's eyes justified in his
[43:45] eyes for the moment yes all right
[43:47] everybody with me yes all right the
[43:51] definition is the act by which God moves
[43:53] a willing person
[43:57] from the state of sin which is Injustice
[44:00] to the State of Grace which is
[44:02] Justice now remember the pardon those of
[44:06] you that may not know or listen to the
[44:08] tape you ought to listen two or three
[44:09] times brother R talks about said there
[44:11] was somebody in a prison getting ready
[44:13] to die and Abraham Lincoln somebody knew
[44:16] Abraham Lincoln and they came to him and
[44:18] they said look I know this man didn't do
[44:20] that there they're doing it you know
[44:22] they're they falsely accused him or even
[44:24] if he did do it I know this is a good
[44:25] man said sir I throw myself at your feet
[44:28] would you pardon this person and so
[44:31] Abraham Lincoln being a Christian man he
[44:32] was he probably thought about a minute
[44:34] he pulled out a sheet of paper and he
[44:36] said I pardon so and so and so and so
[44:38] signed Abraham Lincoln well that man was
[44:40] so happy he took that thing back to the
[44:42] Jailer and he said
[44:44] here this is signed by the president of
[44:46] the United States so he went in and read
[44:49] it to his friend and what his friend
[44:51] do his friend didn't believe right he
[44:56] became became an
[44:59] unbeliever that the pardon of the piece
[45:01] of that can't be Abraham Lincoln's
[45:03] signature he would have come himself or
[45:05] he'd had some kind of presidential seal
[45:07] or see the guy wanted him to come the
[45:09] way he wanted him to come come on
[45:11] somebody we want God to do things the
[45:13] way we want it
[45:15] done but it was a simple pardon and it
[45:17] would have let the man go free but he
[45:20] did not he did not accept that pardon he
[45:23] gave it back to him and he said I don't
[45:25] think it's valid I don't think can do
[45:27] that I don't think I don't believe it's
[45:31] what he said well he was killed the next
[45:34] morning or executed for the crime and
[45:37] remember even brother rown said the
[45:39] Supreme Court had to rule on that
[45:40] because it was a signed signature by the
[45:42] president of the United States to Pardon
[45:43] that person so then the law now is a
[45:47] pardon is not a pardon unless it's
[45:49] accepted as a pardon if that man would
[45:52] have accepted it guess what he'd have
[45:54] walked out that day if you accept it
[45:56] today you'll walk out that day that door
[45:58] with your past sins gone yes sir but
[46:01] remember it doesn't do away with your
[46:03] future sins that's
[46:06] right Romans 3 says even the
[46:08] righteousness of God which is by faith
[46:10] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[46:13] them that believe for there is no
[46:15] difference for all have sinned and come
[46:18] short of the glory of God all right
[46:20] we're all in on we're all in this mess
[46:22] together there's no good ones or bad
[46:25] ones when you look at it that way all
[46:26] right is everybody with me so being
[46:29] justified freely by his grace through
[46:32] the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[46:34] didn't cost you a dime that's right
[46:36] didn't cost that guy dime if he would
[46:37] accepted that pardon he would have been
[46:39] set free didn't cost him anything you
[46:41] know what it did it cost him his life to
[46:43] not believe it come on somebody it cost
[46:46] him his life to not believe what God
[46:48] tells you to do it'll cost you your life
[46:51] oh no I'm living I'm living no you're
[46:54] dead you're dead while you're alive if
[46:56] you're not born
[46:57] again whom God has set forth to be a
[47:00] pritu through
[47:03] faith through faith in his blood to
[47:06] declare what your righteousness nope to
[47:10] declare his righteousness in other words
[47:12] to cover your
[47:14] sins for the remission of look sins that
[47:17] are passed listen we're not Catholic you
[47:20] can't say God now I'm going to I'm G to
[47:22] make something I'm goingon to do
[47:23] something bad tomorrow could you forgive
[47:25] me and then you just go right on and do
[47:26] it no that's
[47:29] Catholicism this is remission for sins
[47:32] that are passed that's why brother Bram
[47:34] said your past sins are done away with
[47:36] at
[47:37] justification but it doesn't do away
[47:40] with that nature that you were born with
[47:43] that's right all right to declare I say
[47:46] that this time his righteousness that he
[47:48] might be just and the justifier of him
[47:51] which believe in Jesus where is boasting
[47:55] then is excluded by what law of Works no
[47:58] but by the law of
[48:01] Faith therefore we conclude now here's
[48:03] Paul bringing it all together therefore
[48:05] we conclude that a man is justified by
[48:07] faith without the Deeds of the dos and
[48:10] don'ts of the
[48:11] law that's what he saying
[48:15] right acts 13 says be it be it known
[48:18] unto you therefore men and Brethren that
[48:20] through this man Jesus Christ is
[48:22] preached unto you the Forgiveness of
[48:23] sins and by him all that believe are
[48:27] Justified look from all
[48:29] things from which you could not be
[48:32] justified by the law of Moses that's why
[48:35] Jesus Christ had to come and die his
[48:37] blood is what covers you his blood is
[48:39] what eradicates your past that's
[48:43] right praise God what a what but but
[48:46] it's so simple it's complicated to the
[48:48] people out there even maybe somebody
[48:51] here but just keep reading the Bible
[48:53] somewhere it's going to
[48:55] click did you get it the first time you
[48:57] opened your Reader book and and it's
[48:59] John and Mary and spot and Cat and all
[49:02] that other stuff no you didn't get it
[49:04] you get it
[49:05] now Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did
[49:08] predestinate them he also called and
[49:10] whom he called them he also Justified
[49:14] and if listen and if he justifies you
[49:17] and you continue on with God you're
[49:19] coming to glorification yes listen the
[49:23] thief on the
[49:25] cross all right everybody with with me
[49:27] the thief on the cross we call that the
[49:30] dead be the deathbed confession where he
[49:32] didn't he couldn't go you know he just
[49:34] said
[49:35] Lord remember me just remember me when
[49:39] you come into your kingdom he was
[49:42] justified so he's going to go to
[49:46] glorification Hey listen everybody that
[49:49] goes to heaven is going to have a
[49:50] glorified body even the even The Sinner
[49:53] that's given eternal life because of you
[49:55] or anybody else or cup of water in my
[49:56] name they're going to be living in a
[49:58] glorified body listen we're not going to
[49:59] be living in a glorified body and
[50:01] they're living in a sin cursed body no
[50:02] the sin curse will be done away with so
[50:04] if you're truly Justified you're already
[50:07] glorified in the eyes of
[50:09] God just don't mess it up Don't Stop
[50:14] keep pressing keep pushing amen if
[50:16] you'll push he'll
[50:21] pull cuz remember you got to make a step
[50:26] you got to be
[50:27] willing if you're not willing if you if
[50:29] you're willing to hang on to all this
[50:30] other stuff out in the world God's not
[50:32] going he's not obligated to save
[50:34] you now brother Brown was talking about
[50:37] justification the type of the people the
[50:39] regenerated man who comes to Christ
[50:41] gives his life in but never becomes hid
[50:43] away into the holy Co Holy Spirit he
[50:46] lives a life that he knows he's eating
[50:47] Mana cuz remember all those people ate
[50:50] Mana in the wilderness and that's the
[50:51] type of the Holy Ghost but remember only
[50:53] two took it over that's right there's
[50:57] many people today that's never went any
[50:58] further than the outer Court the veil
[51:01] yet they are Christians look by the
[51:03] millions they enjoy Christ in an outward
[51:05] form they go to church with a
[51:07] consolation of knowing they belong to
[51:09] Spoken Word Church in Lula Georgia but
[51:12] they have never become hid away with him
[51:15] in the inner courts come
[51:18] on that's
[51:20] justification God I'm
[51:23] sorry please forgive me for what I did I
[51:26] want to make my life right help me amen
[51:30] help
[51:32] me and that's God is what just to
[51:39] forgive that's why you call it
[51:40] justification he's just to forgive cuz
[51:43] he's the just and the
[51:45] justifier amen put it all on him he'll
[51:47] take it away yes right so that was
[51:53] justification in that fifth Church age
[51:57] but now let's go to the Philadelphian
[51:58] Church age because this is the age of
[52:00] what now we've got the age of Brotherly
[52:01] Love but this is the age that types
[52:04] sanctification to the
[52:07] Believers to the angel of the church in
[52:09] Philadelphia write these things sayith
[52:10] he that's holy true ha the key of David
[52:13] and openeth no man shutteth shutteth and
[52:16] no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I
[52:19] have set before thee an Open Door no man
[52:21] can shut it for thou Hast a little
[52:23] strength and kept my word remember it's
[52:25] not two shoots anymore it's heading to a
[52:27] stock right it's heading toward the it's
[52:30] heading toward the Perfection it's
[52:32] heading toward the Original Seed but
[52:34] it's not the Original Seed it don't even
[52:36] look like it
[52:38] hello it don't look like it till it goes
[52:41] out here and produces grain again
[52:43] itself that's what we're in
[52:46] now you know the same man that went in
[52:48] the ground Jesus Christ is the same man
[52:50] that went to ground in those people in
[52:52] the fourth Church
[52:54] age he was in by the Holy Ghost we don't
[52:57] think he's two people
[52:59] right okay I Know Thy Works behold I
[53:02] have set before thee an open door and no
[53:04] man can shut it for thou Hast a little
[53:05] strength and H has kept my word and has
[53:07] not denied my name the church age lasts
[53:09] from 1750 to 1906 so we're coming up to
[53:12] Aza Street 1906 which is the baptism of
[53:14] the Holy Ghost love of the Brethren is
[53:16] the name of Philadelphia that's what it
[53:18] means now let's look here just a minute
[53:20] brother Ram talks about this I Know Thy
[53:22] Works behold I have set before thee an
[53:23] Open Door no man can shut it for thou
[53:25] Hast a little strength and has kept my
[53:27] word and not denied my name a little
[53:30] strength now remember I wrote myself
[53:31] this is my note a little strength it was
[53:34] still though an unfulfilled
[53:36] age because it was the age of
[53:39] sanctification not the age of the
[53:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost all right
[53:42] everybody with me so there was a little
[53:45] strength but it was still unfulfilled
[53:47] listen God keeps moving he's moving so
[53:51] sanctification the the the meaning of it
[53:53] is a compound meaning brother Brown
[53:55] tells us many many times of of the Greek
[53:57] word sanctification is cleaned up and
[54:01] set aside for service cleaned up now
[54:05] hang on a minute Martin Luther was
[54:08] cleaned up in his day for his day but
[54:11] John Wesley comes and brings it into a
[54:13] form of worship where that you are
[54:17] Sanctified right all right we'll get to
[54:20] that so cleaned up what happened in that
[54:23] sixth Church age things started getting
[54:24] cleaned up God started started sending
[54:27] missionaries all over the world to clean
[54:29] up the world you ever thought about that
[54:32] that's why the missionary goes to some
[54:33] place he goes to not clean up the mess
[54:36] but to clean up the
[54:40] mess didn't know what Paul did Paul went
[54:42] to the Corinthians to clean up their
[54:45] mess amen and he had to go back twice to
[54:49] clean up their mask but that's what he
[54:51] did but he cleaned them up and set them
[54:53] aside for use or purpose like I said
[54:56] before God picks up the the the bottle
[54:59] he's going to use it so he justifies
[55:02] picking the bottle up right as dirty as
[55:05] it is he justified picking it up because
[55:07] in God's mind he's got used for it all
[55:09] right then he comes to a place he says
[55:11] now I can't drink out of that so I've
[55:14] got to clean the inside of that thing up
[55:17] right so he starts pouring the word in
[55:21] washing of the water of the word he
[55:23] starts pouring the word in and what
[55:25] comes out is trash as sister shepher
[55:27] dream was trash coming out of her right
[55:32] now we know that's in the second form of
[55:35] sanctification but we're talking about
[55:36] the first form of sanctification when
[55:38] you come to the when you come to a
[55:40] realization you're lost and you don't
[55:42] you're sick and tired of being sick and
[55:43] tired you don't want to do what you used
[55:44] to do God is just to forgive you if
[55:47] you'll ask him but remember if you're a
[55:50] smoker
[55:52] yes but that Demon's still there he'll
[55:55] forgive you for what you did but that
[55:57] Demon's still
[55:58] there and he is what
[56:01] motivating you to do that he still got a
[56:05] little needle stuck in your
[56:08] soul can I say it that way cuz your
[56:11] Soul's not sealed yet he's still got a
[56:13] needle stuck in there and he's got a way
[56:15] to get back in there to make you do
[56:17] something that you did before that you
[56:20] previously don't want to do anymore but
[56:22] if you keep going on you got to keep
[56:25] moving you got to keep reading your
[56:27] Bible going to church quit doing the
[56:29] things you used to do quit getting
[56:31] around the people that you were around I
[56:33] lost a lot of good
[56:35] friends listen I lost a lot of good
[56:37] friends just to come to church not that
[56:40] I was trying to live a clean life I'd go
[56:41] to church and they'd want to go party or
[56:43] part or hunt on Sunday that's what I did
[56:47] but I don't do that no
[56:49] more not like that anyway every
[56:53] Sunday so you're set aside you're
[56:55] cleaned up set aside for for service as
[56:56] we said the glass would be but now
[56:59] remember when God picked something
[57:01] up does God ever make a
[57:04] mistake so when you know God's picked
[57:07] you up see there's that those who he has
[57:12] Justified he's going to use
[57:14] you he's already
[57:16] glorified he sees that bottle already
[57:20] clean and workable and
[57:22] full praise God not your neighbor not
[57:25] your husband not your wife not your
[57:26] sister not your brother
[57:29] God in your heart you have a revelation
[57:31] that God did that for you he's not going
[57:33] to lose you now he may do you like he
[57:36] did that brother that said you know I
[57:37] ain't going to have no more what was it
[57:39] Ramsay brother Ramsey the the preacher I
[57:41] don't want to have no more of God I
[57:42] don't want nothing to do I'm just going
[57:43] to start drinking again well he was gone
[57:46] in six months brother Bram said God took
[57:48] him home took his servant home so he
[57:52] wouldn't Mar his name you can get them
[57:54] demons on you
[57:57] really
[57:58] yeah brother brandham tried to kill
[58:01] himself
[58:03] twice if those bullets would have went
[58:05] off he' shot eight
[58:09] kids now that's when he was a kid but
[58:11] when he did that what brother Bob was
[58:13] talking about he was a born- again
[58:15] believer he was a
[58:17] prophet people don't like that but he
[58:20] tried to commit suicide twice cuz he'd
[58:23] come to his wit in out here but what did
[58:25] he say when he leaned over and saw hope
[58:28] and and Sharon
[58:30] Rose he said I almost agreed with the
[58:33] devil he said but something held
[58:38] me and God was protecting that gift he
[58:41] wasn't protecting William brandom he was
[58:42] protecting that gift when he didn't let
[58:44] them bullets go off he was protecting
[58:46] that gift knowing that man would go
[58:47] through that but listen he came out so
[58:50] much better he came out with a fervor he
[58:53] said now I know what I'm doing now I
[58:55] know I don't need to listen to this one
[58:57] that one this one I need to listen to
[58:58] what God Said Yes sir cuz he's the one
[59:00] that took me out of all that so you
[59:03] might have to get to your L of lows you
[59:04] may have to get to the end of your Rob
[59:06] tie knot and hang on
[59:08] Hallelujah come to church read your
[59:10] Bible yes
[59:12] sir yes sir at least
[59:16] try
[59:18] effort Bible says
[59:22] willing so the Philadelphian Church age
[59:24] listen what brother Brown said remember
[59:26] the sardian age started the Reformation
[59:29] that most still must go on until the
[59:31] grain that was planted at Pentecost goes
[59:33] to the full cycle he's talking about
[59:34] Pentecost full cycle planting watering
[59:36] nourishing until it comes right back to
[59:38] Original Seed now he's talking about
[59:41] us he's talking about
[59:45] us while this is going on the tears that
[59:48] were swn will have to go through their
[59:50] cycle and be harvested also Hey listen
[59:53] when those horse riders rode out they
[59:55] SED a seeed they loosed a false Ministry
[59:59] and they had converts they had people
[1:00:02] that agreed with what they said and
[1:00:04] they're not bride
[1:00:07] right Satan's got his people God's got
[1:00:10] his people just to where it is law of
[1:00:14] contrast I want you to see something
[1:00:16] here God works in threes doesn't he he
[1:00:18] was in the third or pergan age that the
[1:00:20] church was married to the state the
[1:00:23] Deeds of the nicians had become the
[1:00:25] doctrine of the
[1:00:26] nians that age was the open door for the
[1:00:29] false Vine once it was backed up by the
[1:00:32] power of the state it became actually a
[1:00:34] world system even though it bore the
[1:00:36] name Christian thus it spread like
[1:00:38] wildfire but now Three Ages later after
[1:00:41] a long and hard struggle of Faith here
[1:00:43] comes the open door to the truth Martin
[1:00:46] Luther John Wesley they didn't have all
[1:00:48] the truth but they were the beginning of
[1:00:51] you and I believing the truth listen we
[1:00:53] don't do away with them we stand on them
[1:00:56] we don't do away with anybody we stand
[1:00:58] on what they believe you ought you
[1:01:00] better believe the just shall live by
[1:01:02] faith cuz you can't live by
[1:01:04] yourself and you can't live by the devil
[1:01:07] you can but not to be a Christian you
[1:01:10] can't the word of the Lord now has its
[1:01:12] day of course the fifth age set the
[1:01:14] stage for this Mighty move as that age
[1:01:16] gave us exploration colonization the
[1:01:18] printing of books John Wesley we know he
[1:01:21] was the um messenger of that age and
[1:01:25] we're not get into all what he did
[1:01:26] because you know what he did he did a
[1:01:27] lot more than we do he preached 800
[1:01:29] sermons in one
[1:01:31] year he rode 4,000 miles in a nice
[1:01:35] Cadillac that drove itself and had oh
[1:01:42] no it was a
[1:01:45] horse Wesley was a remarkable strong man
[1:01:48] he says of himself that he cannot
[1:01:50] remember now any any of you can can
[1:01:54] can can you do that
[1:01:57] can you say that you have felt
[1:01:59] loneliness of spirit a quarter hour
[1:02:01] since he was
[1:02:03] born a quarter of an hour what is that
[1:02:07] 15
[1:02:08] minutes there was 15 minutes in his life
[1:02:11] that he felt
[1:02:14] bad some of y'all have been feeling bad
[1:02:16] for the past 15
[1:02:19] minutes he slept more no more than 6
[1:02:22] hours a day Rose in time to start
[1:02:23] preaching at 5: practically every day of
[1:02:26] his ministry preached up to four times a
[1:02:28] single day and he have an average 800
[1:02:31] sermons travel thousand of Miles 4,500
[1:02:34] miles on a
[1:02:35] horse you know why he had a fervor he
[1:02:38] believed in the power of God he believed
[1:02:40] God was going to do what he said he
[1:02:41] would do
[1:02:42] yes that's brother John get all you can
[1:02:45] save all you can give all you can
[1:02:47] remember
[1:02:50] that he was a good candidate for James
[1:02:52] because he based his eternal life on
[1:02:54] faith and works not just faith faith
[1:02:56] faith and works see what he done is he
[1:02:58] took Martin Luther said hey do away with
[1:03:01] works that just shall live by faith now
[1:03:03] listen John Wesley's Revelation was a
[1:03:06] little more upgraded he didn't do away
[1:03:08] with that but he brought the real works
[1:03:10] of God back into the church that's right
[1:03:14] the real works of God because listen
[1:03:16] faith without works is dead yes all
[1:03:19] right you got to have a little bit of
[1:03:20] words when you get born again we don't
[1:03:22] have to chase you to find you every
[1:03:24] Sunday
[1:03:26] that's
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:29] right he died 88 years
[1:03:32] old he served God as few men would dare
[1:03:35] to even think they
[1:03:37] might let's read this real quick and
[1:03:39] then we'll close we'll get this
[1:03:40] afternoon to the angel of the church in
[1:03:41] Philadelphia right these things sayith
[1:03:43] he that is Holy now watch He's holy he
[1:03:45] that is true he that hath the Key of
[1:03:47] David he that openeth no man shth and
[1:03:49] shutteth and no man
[1:03:51] openeth brother R look he said look
[1:03:53] these things sayith he that is true now
[1:03:55] this word true is a very wonderful
[1:03:57] word it does not mean true in just the
[1:04:00] sense that is opposite to
[1:04:02] false God's never been false right
[1:04:06] remember in our age it calls for the
[1:04:08] faithful and true witness not that he
[1:04:10] was ever a false one but remember when
[1:04:13] you hit that symbol and it's supposed to
[1:04:15] be a c whatever that what you call that
[1:04:18] thing Pitchfork or tuning fork when you
[1:04:21] hit that tuning fork you get a true
[1:04:23] sound that's what the faithful and true
[1:04:26] Witnesses so in this age it does not
[1:04:28] mean true in just a sense that is
[1:04:29] opposite to false it expresses the
[1:04:32] perfect realization of an idea as
[1:04:35] contrasted with its partial realization
[1:04:37] as in mana mana what Mana was given Mana
[1:04:40] what Mana or had wiggle tails the next
[1:04:44] day but remember it's a type of the Holy
[1:04:45] Ghost Holy Ghost don't have wiggle Tails
[1:04:47] it's just you can't hold it over you
[1:04:49] need a new revelation every day you need
[1:04:51] to pray for God for Revelation Lord help
[1:04:54] me I'm stuck in a stuck in a
[1:04:57] rut maybe I'm preaching to
[1:05:00] me for example we recall that Jesus said
[1:05:03] Moses gave you not that bread from
[1:05:05] heaven but my father giveth you the true
[1:05:06] bread look true bread he was the true
[1:05:10] bread from Heaven John 15 says I am the
[1:05:13] True
[1:05:14] Vine Hebrews 9:24 says for Christ has
[1:05:17] not entered into the holy Place made
[1:05:19] with hands which are the figure figures
[1:05:21] of the true but into heaven itself now
[1:05:24] to appear in the presence of God for us
[1:05:27] Darkness has passed and the True Light
[1:05:29] now shineth since this word indeed
[1:05:31] expresses perfect realization as against
[1:05:33] the idea of partial realization as
[1:05:36] Illustrated in these verses we can Now
[1:05:38] understand as never before now watch
[1:05:40] antitype contrasted with type and
[1:05:43] substance with
[1:05:45] Shadow they had a
[1:05:47] shadow Bible says a shadow of things to
[1:05:50] come but not the very image I'm quoting
[1:05:53] you scripture this is the image image
[1:05:55] right here this right here is not if I
[1:05:58] hold that up against the light there's a
[1:05:59] shadow going to be over there and it'll
[1:06:00] be exactly what my hand is but it won't
[1:06:03] be my hand so there's a shadow but that
[1:06:06] shadow types that there's something real
[1:06:09] in front of that
[1:06:11] light amen when know in type we know in
[1:06:15] part part type we know in part we
[1:06:18] prophesy in part but that which is
[1:06:20] perfect has come that's why listen
[1:06:22] that's why the son of man Ministry if
[1:06:23] Satan will stop right here here come on
[1:06:27] musician if Satan can incarnate a
[1:06:31] beast now listen to me real quick let's
[1:06:34] stand if Satan can incarnate a beast and
[1:06:38] have him do what he says to do in the
[1:06:43] garden and he comes down here and
[1:06:45] incarnates himself in a pope and they
[1:06:48] even think he's God
[1:06:50] yes why can't the true God hallelujah
[1:06:54] come on somebody why can't the true God
[1:06:57] get in the True Believer and it be God
[1:06:59] on the earth and it be not a second
[1:07:01] person but the god the son of
[1:07:04] man when you raise your hand God rais
[1:07:06] his hand when you look God lookes when
[1:07:08] you speak God
[1:07:10] speaks it can't be a
[1:07:14] type brother R said this per messenger
[1:07:16] of Malachi 4 do two things right number
[1:07:19] one turn the hearts of the children to
[1:07:20] the fathers then he
[1:07:23] said after the seals is open open and
[1:07:25] the thunder sound we are literally
[1:07:28] turned back this is literal that's a
[1:07:32] shadow that's a shadow this is
[1:07:34] literal why you say oh no the the son of
[1:07:38] man is is is there ain't no way he could
[1:07:41] be back here on Earth cuz his body's not
[1:07:44] here well I know that but he made a
[1:07:47] provision he transferred power he made a
[1:07:51] provision and said the son of man would
[1:07:54] be back on the Earth again at the end
[1:07:56] time for just a short period of time and
[1:07:59] if we know one thing's for sure if he's
[1:08:01] not here in physical form he's got to be
[1:08:03] in somebody or El lied hallu so he takes
[1:08:07] your flesh the thing that job says this
[1:08:09] is all rotten it's all vanity it's all
[1:08:12] felt but he says I'll Stand in My Flesh
[1:08:14] and I'll see God I'll Stand in my flesh
[1:08:17] I don't care if anybody got to go by the
[1:08:19] grave they're going to stand in their
[1:08:20] flesh and they're going to see God but I
[1:08:23] pray that we all everyone of Us come to
[1:08:26] so much of a sanctification to where the
[1:08:28] devil don't know what to do with us till
[1:08:30] we be so so slick with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:32] not slick with the devil slick with the
[1:08:34] Holy Ghost and when he takes his fingers
[1:08:36] and starts to jab in you it just slides
[1:08:38] right off you say oh that can't happen
[1:08:41] to me cuz I okay you just become an
[1:08:46] unbeliever we must believe for things
[1:08:49] that we can't even see
[1:08:52] right but listen if we know the one they
[1:08:55] can see
[1:08:56] it he'll send you somebody to show it to
[1:09:01] you you just got to believe it were we
[1:09:05] there when brother brandham had all
[1:09:06] those dreams and Visions were we there
[1:09:07] when he went across a curtain at time
[1:09:10] were any of y'all in that bedroom with
[1:09:12] him any of you have a camera where you
[1:09:15] were you
[1:09:17] photographing no but you know what I
[1:09:20] believe it cuz it fits the
[1:09:23] Bible it fits the going AC cross it fits
[1:09:26] this next life that we're going to the
[1:09:28] real one it
[1:09:30] fits so guess what down in my soul it
[1:09:33] rings a bell that ain't nothing but the
[1:09:37] truth there's a lot of people don't
[1:09:38] believe he did a lot of things there's a
[1:09:39] lot of people don't believe he's round
[1:09:40] when the cloud and all I really don't
[1:09:44] care I know in my heart that Christ came
[1:09:47] to me through that man's
[1:09:49] message so take all that other junk out
[1:09:52] of the way and that ain't junk we know
[1:09:53] it didn't happen but the junk that
[1:09:54] they're saying out the
[1:09:56] world that that brother brownan was this
[1:09:58] I don't
[1:09:59] care he brought a reality when he stood
[1:10:02] up and he said this day this scripture
[1:10:06] preached that and that and that message
[1:10:08] came forth he was telling us that this
[1:10:12] day this
[1:10:14] Bible is been made
[1:10:16] Alive walking breathing
[1:10:19] instrumentalities of God I believe that
[1:10:22] with all my heart if I don't see it I
[1:10:24] pray God somebody does I pray God that
[1:10:27] we'll walk into
[1:10:29] it and one day it'll just
[1:10:31] happen you know Abraham before the day
[1:10:34] before he got a body changed he probably
[1:10:36] was he's he met he met God but he knew
[1:10:40] that but he was probably still probably
[1:10:41] when he got up to to tell MDC by he
[1:10:44] probably had
[1:10:45] to amen amen he was
[1:10:49] 99 when MDC met him but what the next
[1:10:53] morning did he have a resurrection
[1:10:56] he had a body change he didn't know what
[1:10:58] to
[1:10:59] do but he was the the Royal Seed of
