[0:31] advantage and sing god bless you all
[0:46] I guess first off I've just got to
[0:49] praise the Lord
[0:50] a miracle has happened in my in my life
[0:52] in my very eyes I'm telling y'all
[0:55] witness my momma yesterday she needed
[0:58] help on her hike because her pipe was
[1:00] leaking I was at no.1 like how to expect
[1:02] her gonna try to take her out to eat my
[1:03] mama suffers with COPD and heart disease
[1:06] and heart failure actually it's been
[1:09] times like has year 2019 have been so
[1:12] rough you guys have no idea
[1:14] I think my mama stretched out on a
[1:17] recliner not able to walk now it was to
[1:19] bathe herself you know she had like a
[1:22] little bit of weight on her to not be
[1:23] like how I am now big like how I am
[1:26] isn't meant to be smaller I got all the
[1:28] weight on me right now but my mom the
[1:30] Lord did a miracle in her she cannot
[1:33] walk she was on oxygen 24 hours a day
[1:36] she could just walk with a little roller
[1:38] thing barely making it and kind of kind
[1:40] of help her get up help her sit down it

[1:43] nurse coming in every day we came out

[1:50] mom won't let you talk about 40 pounds

[2:08] go without thinking my lord
[2:09] but the miracle was so great it was just
[2:11] so much for me we took her out to eat
[2:14] she walked in the restaurant
[2:15] she walked herself out she put herself
[2:17] into the van it was a miracle I'm
[2:21] telling it's a miracle to me if I know
[2:23] my Lord Jesus did it there's so many
[2:25] times I prayed there our testimony broke
[2:28] my heart you know sometimes you try to
[2:29] hold yourself around your family people
[2:31] you know you don't want to get emotional
[2:33] and upset them as she was just speaking
[2:34] to me about how hard it's been for her
[2:37] she said sometimes she wouldn't lay
[2:39] there spending so much like pain and
[2:42] despair like me to get around everything
[2:44] like Lord just take me make me write
[2:46] this let me give me rest Lord either
[2:48] heal me or give me rest
[2:50] I'm emotional my momma said these things
[2:52] because I don't wanna get all upset or
[2:55] anything like she does really know how I
[2:56] am just personally like in my heart she
[3:01] just share that let me just broke my
[3:02] heart somebody's house I want to fix my
[3:03] momma it's like I want to be the one to
[3:05] fix it only be the one who figures it
[3:06] doctor only be the one to help her but I
[3:07] have three kids husband a lot of
[3:09] responsibilities they can't really be
[3:11] there for her in that way
[3:12] to carry her on my shoulders and I have
[3:15] really prayed I really prayed and I said
[3:17] like lord please let my mama died
[3:26] brother I'm like Lord if I have a way to
[3:29] Dalby forgive me Jesus about have you
[3:31] waited for me
[3:35] I'm serious God forgive me Who am I I'm
[3:40] nothing but that is by His grace he told
[3:43] me how to dress my just oh that I got on

[3:49] put it on this morning it's a long hard
[3:54] so I just sing the songs he is glory God
[3:56] answer my prayers
[3:58] you know it's super emotional affair
[4:00] like I find like here it's been a very
[4:01] new experience for me most people are
[4:03] not very emotional I kind of know it's
[4:04] just new for me it's really new we went
[4:07] to churches very lively so it's coming
[4:11] like to be used to everything being
[4:13] taught and listening and learning you
[4:15] know just humbling you know in learning
[4:17] things by His grace it's been a long
[4:19] journey but I think the Lord kind of
[4:21] kept me back to see my momma walking
[4:22] he's don't know it's a miracle it's a
[4:25] miracle to see like so much all that
[4:26] water weight came off of her she was
[4:28] holding so much fluid in the last prayer
[4:30] because I asked for her the surgeons
[4:32] actually want to get another surgery on
[4:34] her because of her so I got some valves
[4:36] they put in her are leaking fluids
[4:37] through her body
[4:38] that's like mama I don't want you get
[4:40] any more surgery every time she gets
[4:42] surgery it sets her back
[4:44] let's prance with Lord Jesus like if
[4:46] it's not his women have a surgery it
[4:48] would heal those valves you know her he
[4:51] is more than able he's the same
[4:53] yesterday today and forever I believe it
[4:55] I mean he saved me I was a rank Center
[4:57] nothing was good in me I'm not ashamed
[4:59] to know the truth nothing was good and
[5:01] this woman right here it's only His
[5:03] grace I did everything there was to be
[5:04] done you know as far as I look at it
[5:06] but God His mercy he picked me up and
[5:10] cleaned me up you know my kids had the
[5:12] same experience
[5:13] I can't even though much as I want to
[5:14] fix them as a momma I know I can't do it
[5:17] they have that experience the Lord and
[5:19] it's what I want for them this song is

[15:57] have breath and life here on the earth
[16:05] and Lord on top of all that we're able
[16:09] to hear from you
[16:10] Raber to be able to get our nourishment
[16:13] sure from the food that you so
[16:14] graciously give us from the ground but
[16:17] Lord the manna from heaven is what we're
[16:20] looking for right now it's that word
[16:23] that will come and we'll never ever make
[16:28] you sick or make your thoughts be wrong
[16:31] Lord this this food that's coming Lord
[16:33] is it's just so precious and pure
[16:36] because it comes from you Lord we thank
[16:40] you for this day that we're living in we
[16:41] thank you for the church we have here
[16:43] Lord all the Deacons the elders pastor
[16:45] all the different ones we thank you for
[16:47] them every every time we
[16:49] we pray we thank you for the people that
[16:51] are here that are assembled together for
[16:54] the ones that are sick that are not with
[16:55] us we pray that you would just heal them
[16:56] father touch their bodies Lord just be
[16:59] with the ones that are on the highways
[17:00] the ones that are not they're not
[17:02] serving the Lord downstairs here and
[17:05] below my feet Lord always we remember
[17:07] that wall of of people that that we're
[17:11] just expecting Lord that that you'll
[17:13] touch their heart and and they'll come
[17:16] on to you father we pray that you'd just
[17:19] be with us now and the further men of
[17:21] the service give us this day our daily
[17:23] bread in the name of Jesus Christ we
[17:24] pray amen Psalms 138 verse 8 do I walk
[17:29] in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive
[17:32] me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[17:36] against the wrath of my enemies and our
[17:39] right hand shall save me the Lord will
[17:42] perfect that which concerning me thy
[17:45] mercy O Lord endureth forever forsake
[17:48] not the works of thine own hands all
[17:51] right let's read Psalms 85 1 turn us O
[17:55] God of our salvation and caused on anger
[17:58] toward us to cease wilt thou be angry
[18:01] with us forever
[18:02] wilt out draw out that anger to all
[18:05] generations will not revive us again
[18:09] that the people may rejoice indeed you
[18:14] may be seated in the Lord at his
[18:15] blessing and reading of the word there's
[18:18] always a rejoicing wilt thou not revive
[18:20] us again that thou people may rejoice
[18:22] indeed that's what a revival is supposed
[18:24] to do as we were in the Bible study last
[18:26] night and and one of them older sisters
[18:31] back there sister Gaby's girl hee she's
[18:36] the oldest one but she asked a question
[18:39] what's the difference in resurrection
[18:40] and and revival well we're not talking
[18:44] about resurrection today sure we're
[18:47] supposed to be resurrected sitting in
[18:48] heavenly places that we as we were
[18:50] talking about we're supposed to already
[18:51] have the Holy Ghost if you already have
[18:53] the Holy Ghost
[18:54] then you need a revival you need
[18:57] something what to spark what's already
[18:59] inside of you something too
[19:02] to make you and the way I see it is is
[19:06] is you can't help but see a revival
[19:09] because something changes in the
[19:12] individuals and you can see it we know
[19:16] that it is an individual revival but if
[19:20] you see faces listen this is just this
[19:22] way it is if you see somebody you know
[19:25] get a spark of a revelation or you see
[19:27] somebody that that hadn't been to church
[19:29] in a while or or you know you see them
[19:32] you see something moving you see
[19:33] something changing you see at least
[19:35] maybe there's expressions on your face
[19:38] now where you've set for all the years
[19:39] with you know with the stone face you
[19:42] know it's just something what everybody
[19:44] else is looking for the church to fill
[19:46] up and I still have a worship team in
[19:49] here brother Russ he said he could get
[19:50] us a worship team for about five
[19:51] thousand dollars you can bring them in
[19:53] here and bring the lights and the smoke
[19:55] and and you know and all that and we
[19:57] could have we could have a revival but
[19:59] that wouldn't be a revival coming from
[20:01] God that would just be making you feel
[20:03] good and you can do that to yourself
[20:05] we're left to 6,000 dollars but you know
[20:09] people do that no but they pay for that
[20:11] to come in to spark the people but but I
[20:14] think if we'll just realize it's got to
[20:17] come from in here anyway it's got to
[20:19] come from deep down inside of you I mean
[20:22] deep down not not in the spirit realm
[20:24] not in the flesh room but not in the
[20:27] soul of man there's got to be a revival
[20:30] to revive what's already inside of you
[20:34] okay kind of like we were explaining
[20:37] last night is it's it's something that's
[20:41] there and something that you know
[20:45] brother Brown said that David didn't
[20:47] lose the salvation he lost the joy he
[20:51] lost the joy have we lost the joy of
[20:53] what we're doing his brother Dale was
[20:56] reading the quote you know this morning
[20:57] you know there's a lot of things that we
[20:59] we just are we just coming to church and
[21:01] if we not changed in the past year two
[21:03] years 10 years 15 years 20 years
[21:05] whatever it is if we've not something
[21:08] has brought us closer to God or either
[21:10] brought us away from God one of the tape
[21:13] remember brother man said your Christian
[21:15] cannot stand idle
[21:16] God is not idle so if you're standing in
[21:20] one place remember you know that how to
[21:22] backslide
[21:23] it's just stay in the place you're in
[21:25] because what's gonna happen is the ones
[21:27] that are not Baxley is gonna move
[21:29] forward and you're gonna be going well I
[21:31] didn't but I didn't go backwards well
[21:33] yeah you did you just didn't realize you
[21:36] went backwards because everybody else
[21:37] went forward but thank God that
[21:40] backsliding has a reverse you can get
[21:46] back in line as a backslider can get
[21:53] right back in line
[21:54] if you'll do what have a revival let
[21:58] something spark in you that had a spark
[22:01] before I'm going to you know brother
[22:03] Brown says it's all on your confession
[22:05] right just what you confess so if you
[22:08] confess that you're going to have a
[22:09] revival then let it start let something
[22:13] one little something start in your life
[22:15] that'll move you toward that let's read
[22:17] the the prayer brother Joe's got it up
[22:20] on the monitor downstairs but this is a
[22:24] to me this covers it all brother branham
[22:27] in 1964 recognizing your Danis message
[22:29] he said God created me revival let me be
[22:34] the revival let each one of us be the
[22:37] revival the revival in me make me Lord
[22:41] to hunger make me to thirst created me
[22:45] Lord that what is needed in me see
[22:48] there's things I need in me that both
[22:50] John doesn't need but there's things in
[22:53] both John needs that I don't need this
[22:54] thing each one of us have different
[22:56] needs because we're all different parts
[22:58] of the body at one body but we're
[23:00] different parts we're different members
[23:02] so let us from this hour on be thine
[23:05] more consecrated servant a better
[23:08] servant more blessed of you more able
[23:11] more humbler more kinder more willing to
[23:14] work more looking to the things that are
[23:17] positive and forgetting the things that
[23:19] are in the past and the negatives let us
[23:22] press toward the mark of the high
[23:23] calling of Christ turn down all that
[23:27] negativism
[23:29] just get away from it you know the best
[23:33] way to combat negativism don't make no
[23:36] comment at all because if you start yeah
[23:39] and back and forth and back and forth it
[23:41] ain't you become negative but the best
[23:44] thing to do is just leave it alone just
[23:45] don't even say nothin to it
[23:46] don't don't even say nothin to
[23:47] negativism just leave it alone we'll do
[23:49] even talk to it it's the devil anyway
[23:51] alright let's go to number two the
[23:53] resurrection of Lazarus we're just kind
[23:55] of the background this goes we're going
[23:56] to try to get to a place that were we
[23:59] were talking about last Sunday at the
[24:01] very end of the service a transfer of
[24:04] power and that's what we're looking for
[24:06] we're looking for the power we listen we
[24:10] have got as we were talking downstairs
[24:12] in the Sunday School class when we read
[24:15] The Book of Revelations it doesn't scare
[24:17] a Christian in this end time to read the
[24:21] book of Revelation because we know the
[24:23] symbols we know what place we we know
[24:26] that that a prophet of God gave us he
[24:28] give us all of the church ages he give
[24:31] us all of the men none of these men I
[24:34] don't think thought they were they
[24:35] Church of a church age messenger they
[24:39] had a message it was a powerful message
[24:40] they went forth but they died but here
[24:43] we are with all of it the full
[24:45] seven-course milled the open book
[24:47] everything's here for us information was
[24:50] that we can look in the Book of
[24:52] Revelations and literally live through
[24:54] it
[24:54] I said literally because John didn't
[24:57] literally live dude he saw a vision and
[24:59] then he died but you and I are that part
[25:03] that we see of the vision that we're
[25:06] either going to make it or not we're
[25:09] either going to be Christ to the
[25:10] Antichrist because that's usually what
[25:12] the Book of Revelations is it's the it's
[25:15] the Antichrist in and Jesus Christ and
[25:17] that's pretty much to all of the Book of
[25:18] Revelations and what and the actions of
[25:23] what goes on to the people during that
[25:25] time so there's people to be this people
[25:28] to be saved people be deceived people to
[25:30] be foolish version and all that is in
[25:32] the Book of Revelations and we see it
[25:34] not coming we see it right here and we
[25:37] can live through it because the Prophet
[25:39] has brought us a message and as I was
[25:41] telling them down
[25:43] I you know all these people like brother
[25:46] Dale said to you we need to find their
[25:48] seventh angel message because the Bible
[25:50] promises let's get back to the Bible
[25:53] okay let's get back to the Bible the
[25:55] book of Revelation says I'm going to
[25:58] send you seven angels' and they will
[26:03] have a message and to the Angel of the
[26:07] Church of and to the Angel of the Church
[26:10] of well there's one in Laodicea we got
[26:12] to find him if brother Branham wasn't
[26:14] yet what if I wasn't a message then we
[26:16] need to find somebody because it's
[26:19] coming because it's the promise in the
[26:20] Bible I just don't you know anyway
[26:24] it's just the devil it's just the
[26:26] Antichrist spirit I told them last night
[26:28] brother man said if we get the what true
[26:31] revelation of the two spirits in the
[26:33] framework and I'm going to say this the
[26:36] framework of this church till that's
[26:41] what's killing us what's the framework
[26:45] the building it starts right here you
[26:52] and I are going to make the whole Bible
[26:57] come to pass whether you're a Christian
[26:59] or whether you're not a Christian one
[27:01] way or the other you're fitting in there
[27:03] somewhere and today when we talk about
[27:05] this we're gonna talk about two
[27:07] different powers one power you're gonna
[27:09] hear brother Ernie probably say it next
[27:11] Sunday
[27:11] he loves to say this word Dunamis which
[27:15] is the word dynamite so you got Dunamis
[27:17] power and then you've got a power called
[27:20] and it's different a power called EXO
[27:25] sia
[27:26] or ex sucia there's two different powers
[27:31] one power is an inherent power that you
[27:34] have inside of you another power is
[27:36] power and authority given to you because
[27:38] Satan can't have Dunamis but he can have
[27:43] EXO SIA hey so SIA is authority that
[27:47] means Authority was just like you say in
[27:49] the Book of Revelations will read in a
[27:50] minute power was given well that's not
[27:53] Dunamis Dunamis power is the baptism
[27:56] holy ghost so he can't get the Holy
[27:58] Ghost to the devil but he can give him a
[28:01] sucia our authority are a limited amount
[28:04] of power but Dunamis there is not a
[28:07] limited amount of power Dunamis is what
[28:10] created this world amen so any waiting
[28:15] that so now if you fall asleep you'll
[28:16] know what the end of the service is the
[28:19] resurrection of Lazarus and Lulla Church
[28:23] brother Brown said brother I feel real
[28:25] good about it now anyway what this
[28:28] church needs today is a good revival not
[28:30] a new doctrine the new order
[28:31] so we're not looking for a new doctrine
[28:33] new order new person just a stirring up
[28:36] with what you already know about all
[28:40] right and remember it comes from you
[28:42] just going back for a couple of quotes
[28:43] that I didn't put in here save time it
[28:45] comes from you it doesn't come from the
[28:47] preacher can't bring it now we can bring
[28:50] we can bring the way to get one the way
[28:54] to get the revival but we can't press
[28:57] you into that revival because it's a
[28:59] word revival now we can pump you up and
[29:01] give you some extra extra sex zuzia but
[29:05] Dunamis power is what we're looking for
[29:07] that's a power that is inherited
[29:10] remember what is the promise brother
[29:12] then something much they didn't receive
[29:13] the promise they didn't receive the
[29:14] promise of Dunamis they had XO sia they
[29:19] had XOC of power they had Authority
[29:21] Barack David
[29:22] all the different ones in the Old
[29:23] Testament they had that permitted power
[29:26] our authority to do what they did but
[29:29] they did not have Dunamis power Dunamis
[29:32] power comes from inside of you dynamite
[29:36] explosion everybody okay with that but
[29:41] there had to be a transfer of power and
[29:42] we'll get to that in just a second but
[29:44] let's finish these let's go to quote
[29:46] number three so it's got to come from
[29:51] you it can't come from your neighbors
[29:52] got to come from you you've got a route
[29:54] you've got to start a revival in your
[29:57] own life and when you do it will change
[30:00] you hello it will change you I want to
[30:07] be changed because if we're
[30:09] Cheng's now forget the body change
[30:14] forget the body change if we don't get
[30:16] changing out brother Brian
[30:18] the Bible says were changed from what
[30:20] glory to glory we're being born again
[30:22] it's the process it's because of the
[30:27] lack of revival among the people there
[30:30] is no revival now we know we're gonna
[30:32] read the quote where brother Brown says
[30:33] the bride hadn't had a revival yet but
[30:35] she's gonna have one but there's no
[30:37] revival here they sit and listen go home
[30:41] well I guess that was pretty good on huh
[30:43] there's not that zeal now remember that
[30:46] word zeal is fervor our passion there's
[30:50] not that something in the people that
[30:54] should be there now he's not saying that
[30:57] they're not Christians there's just
[31:00] something in the church or in the people
[31:02] that are there something they're lacking
[31:04] and I believe what it is it's a word
[31:10] revival it's the revival of the Word of
[31:13] God into people but we're promised that
[31:17] this revival is going to come folks
[31:20] whether you can it's like it's like who
[31:23] was it I may be a brother branham he
[31:24] said you know you you know you go out in
[31:26] the morning and about four o'clock in
[31:29] the morning you get on your knees and
[31:31] you say God the sun's not gonna come up
[31:33] the sun's not I believe the sun's not
[31:36] gonna come up my son's gonna come up
[31:39] because God has already put in motion
[31:41] that that thing's gonna come up every
[31:44] every how many hours so you can't pray
[31:47] that down now you can pray that it stops
[31:50] because somebody did one time somebody
[31:53] named Joshua with excessive power not do
[31:59] too much but he got authority from God
[32:02] to do what he said what about us that's
[32:03] what brother Brown was always trying to
[32:05] tell us what about us with the power
[32:07] inside of us through the whole Old
[32:08] Testament they did all of that without
[32:10] the Holy Ghost inside of their soul
[32:12] leading them and guiding them that
[32:16] authority was enough for them to stop
[32:18] the son
[32:22] change the course of all different
[32:24] things but where's the revival it's got
[32:27] to be among the people that there is no
[32:30] revival they sit they go and listen say
[32:32] well that was a pretty good sermon
[32:34] there's not that zeal there's not that
[32:38] something in the people that should be
[32:41] there now what brother rush were you
[32:43] looking for it that's what it is there's
[32:45] that something there's that something
[32:48] that we're still here 50 years later
[32:50] there's that something we're lacking but
[32:55] we can't keep saying there's something
[32:56] lacking something somewhere down the
[32:59] road something's got a spark if
[33:01] something gotta hit us yeah I don't know
[33:03] God may have to hit us with a 10-ton
[33:05] brick some of us can be touched by
[33:08] feathers some of us it takes bricks
[33:10] remember some come kicking and screaming
[33:12] and some come praising the Lord so I was
[33:14] one of those that come kicking and
[33:15] screaming so but you know what
[33:18] same results we're here we have arrived
[33:23] so let's go - Joel - here's your promise
[33:26] be glad then you children of Zion and
[33:27] rejoicing the Lord your God for he hath
[33:29] given you the former rain moderately he
[33:32] will cause to come down for you the rain
[33:34] the former rain and the latter rain in
[33:36] the first month and the floors shall be
[33:40] full of weed and the facts shall
[33:41] overflow with wine and oil and I will
[33:44] restore or revive to you the years that
[33:48] the locust has eaten the cankerworm kind
[33:50] of pill upon warm cuz remember whatever
[33:53] those bugs did they never killed the
[33:56] tree they never killed the tree the tree
[34:01] still had life in it
[34:04] let's just say that tree had Dunamis
[34:06] life in it it had life that what brother
[34:09] understood that life went down into them
[34:11] roots and just hid and then God just
[34:14] called it right back up amen
[34:17] so I will restore it to you so it's a
[34:20] promise now maybe that's the promise to
[34:22] the Jews we know that and that's the
[34:24] promise that to Israel I mean but that's
[34:26] the promise to me in you because he's
[34:28] gonna pour out his spirit upon all flesh
[34:31] okay but I will
[34:33] restore our revive to you the years that
[34:37] the locust is eating cankerworm pummel
[34:39] worm caterpillar my great army which I
[34:41] sent among you remember it's the same
[34:42] bug just in different stages all right
[34:44] so let's go to number four brother I was
[34:48] talking about that little that little
[34:50] Creek bubbling up they said it didn't
[34:53] need no filter no strainer no pumping no
[34:55] jerking no nothing else it's just there
[34:58] bubbling up it don't have to depend on
[35:01] local rains to fill it up rains or
[35:04] revivals where that fountain that's at
[35:07] that fountain of life where the
[35:09] carcasses the Eagles will gather thank
[35:11] God the Book of Revelations tells us
[35:13] that there's going to be a river of life
[35:15] flowing out from under the throne
[35:18] perpetually for eternity this thing is
[35:21] going to flow and keep flowing and
[35:23] you're not gonna need a filter man it's
[35:25] not gonna have to build a pump we're not
[35:27] gonna have to have maintenance workers
[35:29] in the Millenium or in the future home
[35:31] we might in the Millennium but not in
[35:33] the future home future home everything
[35:35] is that perpetual Dunamis power that
[35:38] said let there be and it did and it
[35:40] didn't it didn't hinder anything what's
[35:46] the greatest hindrance take your finger
[35:49] and turn it around and go there's the
[35:53] greatest hindrance most of us do this
[35:55] and stop that you're supposed to do this
[36:00] I'm my worst enemy you're your worst
[36:03] enemy but God give us away he give us
[36:09] something he gave us a power that no
[36:11] person has ever been given he'd give us
[36:14] a an inherent power and we'll read that
[36:16] in just a minute now look where we at
[36:20] number four where the carcass is the
[36:21] Eagles will be gathered so it's got to
[36:23] be now watch what he says why did he
[36:25] bring that in with rains or revival why
[36:28] did he bring them where the carcass is
[36:30] the Eagles will gather remember the
[36:32] carcass is what the Word of God so it's
[36:35] got to be a word revival that this rain
[36:37] is going to fall on to this word that's
[36:41] already been there I was thinking this a
[36:42] few minutes ago as I said before look at
[36:45] all this information we got
[36:49] but if it's not quickened its dead
[36:51] letter we've got all the information we
[36:55] need we've had a prophet come and give
[36:59] us the love letter that God wrote before
[37:02] the foundation of the world delivered it
[37:05] to us so when we look at what are we
[37:09] lacking we're lacking me being the
[37:13] problem but God's trying to send us a
[37:18] rain or a revival cuz you promised
[37:22] because what brought that plant back in
[37:25] the book of Joel the rain the former
[37:28] rain the teaching rain brought the life
[37:31] back up into that tree now the tree
[37:35] wasn't there he had to just rework
[37:36] itself because the member it came up
[37:38] into two shoots Luther Wesley was to
[37:42] stop pentecost was to shut and then
[37:45] we're looking at full seed now we're not
[37:47] looking at shuck we're not looking at
[37:48] stocks we're not looking at leaves we're
[37:50] looking at the fully matured grain
[37:52] alright that's our Bible now Luke tried
[37:55] a revival no doubt as we talked before
[37:57] there were cycles of revival that have
[37:59] happened even back you know when g20
[38:02] zhis I say Jesus when Jesus stood out
[38:04] there in the middle of nowhere and said
[38:05] let there be that was a revival and that
[38:09] revival never waned we get back to that
[38:13] but that same power that's in him
[38:15] supposed to be a menu
[38:17] I said supposed to be but we limit it we
[38:25] limit it bad but where the carcass is
[38:28] the Eagles will gather you don't have to
[38:29] pump up a revival you don't have to pump
[38:32] up nothing only thing you have to do is
[38:35] just come to the fountain it's always
[38:37] full of good fresh water and there's no
[38:39] end to it it just keeps on bubbling all
[38:42] right let's go to number five that's the
[38:44] way you get a revival that's when you
[38:45] really get in the spirit of revival I'm
[38:48] saying again how many of you really want
[38:51] a revival I mean I want to
[38:53] real revival I want something to spark
[38:56] in my life where that you can see it
[38:59] Welsh revival policeman walking down the
[39:04] street where's the world for a Bible he
[39:06] said it's in me and if I paraphrase for
[39:09] a few minutes I'd be the guide say if
[39:11] you'll hang around a little while you'll
[39:12] see it it's in me it's when you're
[39:17] really getting in the spirit of revival
[39:19] not whooping it up sometimes or
[39:20] something but by praying it down so
[39:23] that's where the rain comes from it
[39:25] comes down until there's a revival
[39:27] strikes your heart until all the logs of
[39:30] ecclesia asks is them all the logs the
[39:32] fanaticism all the logs of systems all
[39:34] the logs of unbelief flow out then the
[39:36] waters of God comes falling down upon
[39:39] you there you are
[39:40] alright let's go to number six so we got
[39:44] to get to the get to the real meat of
[39:46] this in just a second all right now look
[39:47] third seal brother Brown said the bride
[39:51] let's read the whole thing now that's
[39:53] what the reason today that the revivals
[39:55] that we're supposed to have
[39:57] we have denominational revivals we
[39:59] haven't had a real stirring now remember
[40:02] in your you got to be careful in reading
[40:05] this because in your go back to the book
[40:08] of Joel that tree was brother Brown
[40:12] called it the restoration of the bride
[40:15] tree so that was a bride tree that was
[40:19] growing but what eat it down this right
[40:22] here denominational ISM eat it down the
[40:26] palmer worm cankerworm caterpillar and
[40:29] the locust all were what anti word
[40:33] because they eat at the truth okay
[40:37] that's what he's saying right here watch
[40:40] we've had denominational revivals but
[40:42] what did he do it could eat the tree it
[40:46] was doing a reverse effect but look it
[40:53] never was a word revival it never was a
[40:56] word revival it was just a revival of
[40:59] feeling good and being happy and sure
[41:01] there were some souls that came in and
[41:03] sure there was some healing and
[41:04] they was from different things and
[41:06] there's you some prayer clumps I just
[41:09] remember that and there was all these
[41:11] different things but it wasn't a word
[41:13] revival the only word revival were under
[41:15] now it's what the prophet of God brought
[41:17] us because it restored us back to the
[41:20] faith of the fathers nothing Luther
[41:23] never restored us back to anything
[41:24] except the just shall live by faith
[41:27] don't have to do penance we just have to
[41:29] live by the faith that God gives us in
[41:31] the Word of God but now here we are here
[41:36] at the end time we have denominational
[41:37] revivals we haven't had a real stirring
[41:40] and I'm that's 1963 he just came out of
[41:44] the greatest revival healing revival
[41:46] that the world had ever known and he
[41:50] said no no no no he said it four times
[41:53] five times no no no no no sir what were
[41:58] see preaching he's preaching the seals
[42:00] there's for the revival was to begin
[42:02] when he said the Bible became a
[42:05] brand-new book in the opening of the
[42:07] seal that man was in and started a
[42:10] revival but it was a word revival you
[42:13] said while it looks so bad because you
[42:15] didn't have as many healing campaigns
[42:16] and people kicked him out of their
[42:18] denominations well that's what it'll do
[42:20] for me and you we were talking last
[42:24] night we we worry about and we do we
[42:28] worry about the things that are the
[42:30] external things that are happening
[42:32] around us but but I mean look Cain was
[42:38] Abel's biggest problem two brothers
[42:42] Judas was Jesus's biggest problem same
[42:46] church so don't think that the problem
[42:51] is gonna be out there no like I said
[42:54] before when we get a revelation of the
[42:56] two spirits in the framework of this
[42:58] church will become an invincible army
[43:03] why because we're weakened and that's
[43:05] not putting it toward any one person
[43:08] zero I'm not thinking of one person
[43:11] except the devil that weakens the true
[43:15] people
[43:16] sorry it just does it weakens the true
[43:20] people that's why I said several weeks
[43:22] ago
[43:22] thank God he's thinning the rains huh
[43:25] you know what when he thins them you
[43:27] don't blame nobody you know my brother
[43:30] Dale gets up and runs about half of
[43:31] y'all don't blame him blame the devil
[43:37] are you blame God I wouldn't do that but
[43:41] gods wanted spending this thing out
[43:43] God's the one that said hang on a minute
[43:46] let's let this thing mature and then I'm
[43:49] gonna send my angels and they're going
[43:52] to harvest and they're gonna cut down
[43:55] wheat and tares and then I'm going to
[43:58] divide them and one's going in one place
[44:01] and one's going in another but that's
[44:03] just the way it is folks we're we're
[44:05] looking maybe you looking for for the
[44:07] government to shut us down or or
[44:09] whatever but you know if they keep
[44:11] telling us that we can't have Church
[44:13] it's coming from our own rights the
[44:17] Baptist has never got up and stood and
[44:19] said well now the message churches they
[44:22] need to just go home and listen to tapes
[44:25] know if somebody from our own ranks the
[44:32] truth whether it's hurt your feathers or
[44:36] not it's the truth we're not being told
[44:38] by the denominational world that we need
[44:40] to shut the churches down and start
[44:41] listening to tapes it's by people in our
[44:44] own ranks and I'm sorry but I look we
[44:49] haven't oh we got millions and millions
[44:51] of church members but not a revival no
[44:54] where no no the bride hasn't had a
[44:58] revival yet see there's been no revival
[45:03] there no manifestation of God to stir
[45:05] the bride yet see we're looking for it
[45:08] it will take those seven unknown
[45:10] thunders as Bob was talking about the
[45:12] other night don't let that scare you
[45:14] that's just the full revelation of the
[45:16] book of redemption the thunders is what
[45:19] what we can understand that the world
[45:22] can understand how that God is real
[45:25] Aaron will saying how that God can take
[45:27] a human flesh change it from the inside
[45:31] out where the devil went into God's Eden
[45:34] and started from the outside really
[45:36] started from the inside but he couldn't
[45:38] get all the way into their soul because
[45:39] they were they were they had to hold a
[45:41] ghost in their soul but he worked on
[45:42] their emotion he worked on Eve's
[45:45] feelings he worked on her natural brain
[45:48] and got her to do what she did well now
[45:50] what's God doing he's using the same
[45:52] thing in Reverse he's bringing me and
[45:56] you to perfection and Satan's going no
[45:59] they're still looking oh I'm sure listen
[46:04] I'm sure Satan is not an idiot but he
[46:07] was standing there one day and he said
[46:09] if you be the Son of God cast yourself
[46:12] down if you be the Son of God turn these
[46:16] stone I know you're hungry turn these
[46:17] stones to bread I know you need
[46:19] something to eat and then that man looks
[46:21] at him and says Satan it's written what
[46:27] word the word is what Satan can't stand
[46:33] Jesus didn't reach and grab him and go
[46:37] no he just looked damn and he said I'm
[46:40] just telling you what the word says man
[46:46] shall not live by bread alone but by
[46:49] every word and I am sure that Jesus
[46:52] didn't have to holler jesus never
[46:56] hollered at a demon ever they hollered
[46:58] at him but he never hollered at a demon
[47:01] you don't have to scream it a demon
[47:05] demon scream out at you but you never
[47:07] have to holler it no demon if you got a
[47:09] little bit of this Dunamis we're talking
[47:11] about here we'll talk about that and say
[47:15] we're getting to it
[47:16] Brian hasn't had a revival yet there's
[47:18] been no revival no manifestation to
[47:20] guard to stir the bride it'll take those
[47:22] seven unknown thunders back there to
[47:23] wake her up again wake her up remember
[47:27] even in in Matthew 25 they were all ten
[47:31] asleep ten wives the five wise and five
[47:37] foolish they were all they all had to be
[47:39] woke up
[47:42] but what happened the five wise had
[47:46] Dunamis they had the oil they had the
[47:49] power that they needed that when the
[47:52] bridegroom made the call they were able
[47:54] to walk into it and the ones that
[47:56] weren't did not have that Dunamis they
[47:59] didn't have the power to what oil their
[48:02] lamps to make their lamps cut on all
[48:04] right now look let's read this one more
[48:10] right here
[48:11] number seven that's the way God does he
[48:15] humiliates us in our educational system
[48:17] not as I'm trying to support ignorance
[48:20] but I'm trying to tell you the
[48:21] difference education can never bring
[48:24] life it takes the Spirit of God to bring
[48:27] life and that life must not come out of
[48:30] just the intellectual revival now we've
[48:33] had some of them we've had some
[48:34] intellectual revivals but it's got to
[48:37] come out of the Bible word revival and
[48:41] that word is same yesterday today and
[48:44] forever and when it falls member scotf
[48:46] all got to come down when it falls today
[48:50] and quickens you get the same results
[48:52] than you did the book of Acts - exactly
[48:54] always has always will be because it's
[48:57] the Spirit of God that conditions the
[48:59] atmosphere that's what we were talking
[49:01] about last week it has to be a Holy
[49:06] Ghost atmosphere and it has to emanate
[49:08] from you because you know you can get
[49:10] you can get anointed by the Holy Ghost
[49:11] and still be lost but you can't be the
[49:14] Holy Ghost and be lost but you can be
[49:17] anointed by the Holy Ghost and be lost
[49:19] but you can't you if you condition the
[49:22] atmosphere now watch this right here
[49:25] number number eight pergamene church
[49:27] churches but God never placed signs
[49:29] ahead of the word signs follow the word
[49:31] that's when he lies I told the woman to
[49:33] bake a cake for him first according to
[49:35] the word of the Lord when she did as the
[49:37] word said - see that's the whole thing
[49:39] when we do as the word said then see
[49:42] results
[49:44] brother Brown says give them the word
[49:46] test well if you ever give yourself one
[49:49] if you ever give yourself forward test
[49:52] do you really believe what you believe
[49:57] ask yourself that question because watch
[50:01] said the proper sign came come to the
[50:06] word first and then watch the miracle
[50:10] the seed word is what energized by the
[50:15] spirit so that word the word like the
[50:18] word on the page is there but when it's
[50:23] energized or put in a Holy Ghost
[50:25] atmosphere or when something comes to
[50:28] give it a watch let's read this right
[50:30] here in John 14 jesus said if you love
[50:34] me keep my word is that okay can I'm not
[50:39] adding to her taken from because God's
[50:41] Word is the commandment if you love me
[50:44] keep my words but he didn't stop there
[50:49] because you can keep every one of the
[50:52] you can keep every one of the Ten
[50:55] Commandments as the rich young ruler did
[50:58] and have one thing wrong and remember
[51:01] what happened but now watch and I will
[51:03] pray the father and he shall give you
[51:05] another comforter so he's got to give
[51:08] you something beside the commandments
[51:10] he's got to give you something what is
[51:16] it and he shall give you another
[51:18] comforter that he may abide with you
[51:20] forever
[51:21] what is it the Spirit of Truth whom the
[51:25] world cannot receive this world
[51:28] absolutely knows nothing about this
[51:32] they've lived under the egg socia power
[51:35] for a long time permitted power or power
[51:38] that God would anoint somebody to do
[51:40] something but Dunamis power is something
[51:43] the world doesn't know anything about
[51:44] even the five foolish virgins they were
[51:47] virgins but they had no Dunamis they had
[51:50] no power because their power would have
[51:52] took them in a rapture right they lived
[51:58] under axial Co though because they were
[52:00] virgins they were they run to the power
[52:02] of God to my people I'm telling you the
[52:08] truth
[52:10] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[52:12] cannot receive because then
[52:15] understandeth him not that word see is
[52:19] not seen through your eyes it
[52:22] understandeth him not neither knoweth
[52:24] him remember Jesus told him he said the
[52:27] world see me no more but you'll see me
[52:29] how we seem we seem through the word but
[52:32] it's not just the word it's got to be a
[52:34] living word but you know him you know
[52:40] him here's the promise why do you know
[52:43] him because of that spirit of truth who
[52:45] I'm gonna give you to help you keep my
[52:49] Commandments right but you know him you
[52:56] know you can really it's okay you know
[52:58] somebody but when that somebody you know
[53:01] dwells inside of you that's still a big
[53:06] difference makes a lot of people knows
[53:09] of God but we supposed to be garden made
[53:14] manifest in another form excuse me
[53:18] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[53:21] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[53:26] in you what the truth of the word equals
[53:30] power not just the word not just the
[53:36] word the word was power the truth of the
[53:42] word equals power because we're going to
[53:43] talk about this in just a minute when we
[53:44] take this transfer of power we're going
[53:47] to watch how Satan diluted it and made
[53:49] it what brother brown said we read it
[53:51] last night he makes the people cold
[53:54] formal and powerless no power all right
[54:02] John 14 let's read but these things have
[54:06] I spoken to you being yet present with
[54:08] you but the comforter which is the Holy
[54:10] Ghost so surprised the comforter is the
[54:14] Holy Ghost okay doesn't tape doesn't
[54:18] take a revelation now it's written in
[54:19] there black and white well written in
[54:21] red but the comforter which
[54:23] the Holy Ghost whom the father will send
[54:25] in my name he shall teach you all things
[54:31] huh and bring all things to your
[54:34] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[54:37] you what a promise John 16 verse 12 13 I
[54:45] have yet many things to say unto you but
[54:48] you cannot bear them now because you've
[54:51] been living under XOC a power you've
[54:54] been living up because when Jesus told
[54:56] them to go cast out Devils sure the
[54:59] power to cast out Devils with Dunamis
[55:02] but it was the authority God give them
[55:05] to do that through his power they had no
[55:08] power that he gave I give you he said I
[55:12] give you power to cast out Devils I give
[55:15] you what he gave them the power to do it
[55:18] howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth who
[55:23] the comforter who the Holy Ghost is come
[55:25] he will guide you into all truth now
[55:30] that River that's going to come out from
[55:32] under the throne there in the future
[55:34] home is not going to be impeded by
[55:36] anything it's just gonna be a flowing
[55:38] river right and you and I are gonna Bay
[55:41] to be able to enjoy the greatest water
[55:44] that we've ever drank but you know what
[55:47] we're drinking of it now if you don't
[55:50] have the live River of Life flowing out
[55:52] of you right now you got a problem but
[55:56] whatsoever he shall hear oh I'm sorry
[55:58] for he shall not speak of himself listen
[56:03] folks he's speaking of me and you John
[56:07] John 14 through John 17 God the Father
[56:13] is speaking through the son and he is
[56:16] transferring all the power to me and you
[56:21] oh I don't believe that well you you can
[56:26] be over there in that axle see a group
[56:28] you can just get in the norming and
[56:30] you'll still be here when the rapture
[56:31] takes place but he shall show you things
[56:35] to come
[56:37] so ever he shall hear that shall he
[56:39] speak and he shall show you things to
[56:42] come he's not you say well now listen
[56:45] let's don't forget Jesus Christ no let's
[56:47] don't but I'm telling you what he said
[56:50] he has transferred that power that he
[56:54] had because we'll read in just a second
[56:57] that the power Jesus had was from the
[57:00] word that he spoke I read your scripture
[57:02] in just second okay everybody okay all
[57:07] right now watch
[57:11] let's read it one more time how be he
[57:13] when the spirit of truth is come he
[57:14] shall guide you into all truth for he
[57:17] shall not speak of himself but
[57:18] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[57:21] speak and he will show you things to
[57:24] come listen you can't make the Holy
[57:26] Ghost speak error that's what he's
[57:29] talking about
[57:29] he's not he's gonna hear straight from
[57:32] God because He is God there's no double
[57:34] minded man that sent me in you were the
[57:38] only double minded people there is God's
[57:40] not double minded what he speaks the
[57:43] Holy Ghost hears and he gives it to me
[57:45] in you so now where is the problem
[57:48] in the transferring of power watch this
[57:52] let's go back then to our favorite book
[57:57] the book of Genesis and we look in the
[58:00] book of Genesis the tale was a man
[58:02] standing in creation and he said all he
[58:05] didn't say then but all power was in his
[58:09] hand there was nothing and he said let
[58:14] there be and folks let there be created
[58:18] universes just from the power that he
[58:23] had to create from nothing faith is the
[58:28] substance of things hoped for the
[58:29] evidence of things not seen by faith
[58:32] things were created that didn't have you
[58:35] know you and I used to well it's easy
[58:36] for us to to make this to make this
[58:39] organ here why because we know where to
[58:41] buy a plastic we know where to buy the
[58:43] metal we know where to get this we know
[58:45] where to get the reeds we know where to
[58:46] get the electrical panels and all these
[58:48] things we know how to do that
[58:51] God don't need that that man stood out
[58:56] somewhere in eternity and he said let
[58:59] there be and every element that's in
[59:01] that piano was created because it all
[59:05] comes from the earth everybody that
[59:06] comes from the earth right so let's
[59:10] watch the transfer of power we see this
[59:14] power it was given to a man named Adam
[59:20] to be ruler ruled the place don't bother
[59:24] me with it you take care of it you ruled
[59:27] this place because remember Adam had
[59:31] part of his daddy inside of him right he
[59:35] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[59:36] he became a living soul
[59:39] and there was Adam standing there with
[59:44] power and he was told that if this
[59:50] mountain needs to be moved or if this
[59:52] tree needs to be moved or if you need to
[59:54] move a river all you got to do is say it
[59:56] you don't have to go you ain't got to go
[1:00:01] have a conference he didn't have to look
[1:00:04] God up every 15 minutes that sound for
[1:00:08] me he doesn't have to go look up the
[1:00:10] preacher every 15 minutes
[1:00:13] Adam believed what God told him but we
[1:00:18] now we know what happened in the fall
[1:00:19] and during that fall God had to take
[1:00:22] some of that power back away from him
[1:00:25] because he could not as brother Aaron
[1:00:28] was talking about it takes a male and a
[1:00:30] female to have children but now it
[1:00:33] doesn't take a male and a female to have
[1:00:34] what Adam and Eve did to have children
[1:00:37] anybody got then everybody got that
[1:00:41] everybody stand up those of you that are
[1:00:44] sleep wake up stand up
[1:00:49] thank you brother boy just do this that
[1:00:51] just skips just this praise Lord just
[1:00:53] raise the Lord praise the Lord and
[1:00:56] that's stomp the devil and
[1:00:58] there you go sounds good and everybody
[1:01:00] good now just do you Nate like this
[1:01:03] alrighty now said back now we need some
[1:01:08] of that Dunamis and actual SIA open my
[1:01:15] board yeah
[1:01:17] so the permit but there was a permitted
[1:01:20] power though watch that power it never
[1:01:23] diminished the power of the Creator for
[1:01:27] Adam to do what he did did not diminish
[1:01:31] that Dunamis or any of that power that
[1:01:33] God had to create but what did God have
[1:01:35] to do God had to pull it back in because
[1:01:40] as we were talking last night if y'all
[1:01:44] thought about this that you've got in
[1:01:45] your in your soul right now you have the
[1:01:48] Creator that can create a world and go
[1:01:53] live on it inside of you today but the
[1:01:58] problem brother Brown said but there's
[1:01:59] your we're with he'll buy a bar what's
[1:02:02] the bar the bar is you the bar is your
[1:02:06] thoughts and your ideas because if God
[1:02:08] would give you that power you'd either
[1:02:10] say bad I and you'd go live on another
[1:02:12] world by your lonesome are that guy that
[1:02:17] pulled out in front of you tomorrow
[1:02:18] morning coming from coming from coming
[1:02:21] from Paoli the only Junction right there
[1:02:26] where everybody thinks the four-way stop
[1:02:28] is a two-way then you just go see you
[1:02:34] later see that's power without character
[1:02:37] that's what brother Aaron was talking
[1:02:38] about you have the power we're looking
[1:02:42] for the character we've got the power
[1:02:44] you got the Holy Ghost in you you got
[1:02:46] ahold you got the creator inside of you
[1:02:48] but it's so bound by you we're our own
[1:02:54] worst enemies but God's trying to tell
[1:02:58] us that he's pulling away all of these
[1:03:00] things he's given us virtue knowledge
[1:03:03] because remember when Jesus stepped on
[1:03:05] the earth listen when Jesus stepped on
[1:03:07] the earth and when they put him on the
[1:03:09] cross he literally
[1:03:10] have just destroyed the whole world with
[1:03:12] one finger listen what he thought in his
[1:03:16] mind he could have destroyed the whole
[1:03:19] world but he was so under subjection to
[1:03:23] that what was inside of him that Dunamis
[1:03:26] that power he did you don't think Jesus
[1:03:30] you know he looked he looked at piling
[1:03:32] policies I got power to to take you know
[1:03:36] I can just make this thing go away and
[1:03:38] Jesus said you don't have any power the
[1:03:43] power that I got you ain't never seen
[1:03:45] before I could call 10,000 legions of
[1:03:50] angels wipe this place off and I could
[1:03:53] just start all over again but you know
[1:03:58] Pilate didn't even take that as a threat
[1:04:00] he just looked at him and said okay all
[1:04:02] right I'm gonna let you go right he was
[1:04:05] wanting to let him go but he had to be
[1:04:09] crucified why for me and you to get that
[1:04:12] Dunamis power inside of us because it
[1:04:14] had not it had become the the power had
[1:04:17] transferred to xoc a power let me read
[1:04:20] the definition of the two and then that
[1:04:23] will help you as I'm talking Dunamis
[1:04:27] power is inherent power okay you have
[1:04:34] inherited power as brother Dan was
[1:04:37] talking about the the promise the
[1:04:41] promise was this Dunamis power inherent
[1:04:44] power power residing in a theme by
[1:04:47] virtue of its nature moral power and
[1:04:52] excellence of soul that sounds pretty
[1:04:56] good doesn't it but now if y'all would
[1:04:58] if you wouldn't mind skipping all the
[1:05:00] way down to to the other Greek lexicon
[1:05:02] Strong's number 18-49 X
[1:05:04] osya means power and authority it even
[1:05:07] means power of choice go to the sifting
[1:05:10] find the other members thank you
[1:05:11] XO see ya means authority sure it gives
[1:05:15] you authority and gives you the right to
[1:05:17] do things and the Liberty to do them he
[1:05:20] told Satan he said you have the Liberty
[1:05:22] to totally destroy job
[1:05:24] one thing you don't have enough power to
[1:05:27] take his life because that stands with
[1:05:29] me
[1:05:30] that was Dunamis but he gave him EXO SIA
[1:05:34] look power of choice liberty of doing as
[1:05:42] one pleases leave or permission physical
[1:05:47] and mental power
[1:05:49] listen Dunamis is not physical or mental
[1:05:53] power do you understand what I'm saying
[1:05:56] it's not Dunamis power is God's power
[1:06:01] it's God us having the mind of Christ is
[1:06:04] that we were talking about this is not
[1:06:05] the mind of Christ this is permitted
[1:06:07] power because that word ekklesia is the
[1:06:10] power in the Book of Revelations that
[1:06:12] was given in the fourth seal the power
[1:06:15] was given for that horse rider to do
[1:06:17] things he done he didn't have Dunamis
[1:06:19] power or he had the Holy Ghost he had
[1:06:21] excellency of power our authority are
[1:06:24] the right are the power of choice see
[1:06:27] Satan Satan doesn't have Dunamis power
[1:06:30] he has EXO SIA because he chose you know
[1:06:35] what he chose he chose that power over
[1:06:37] Dunamis power if he chose Dunamis power
[1:06:41] brother Brown City you've been our
[1:06:42] brother if he could get the Holy Ghost
[1:06:44] but he can't but he can have a power a
[1:06:46] permitted power or a power of choice are
[1:06:50] a power of authority there might get
[1:06:52] with the difference in the two the first
[1:06:54] one is an inherent power Romans 8 says
[1:06:59] were errors and joint heirs with God
[1:07:02] that makes us equal that is our
[1:07:05] inheritance our inheritance was not this
[1:07:09] it was the one that's inside they don't
[1:07:14] start a revival it's what's inside
[1:07:17] that's working its way out we have
[1:07:20] Dunamis power
[1:07:22] we got something Satan don't even have
[1:07:24] he can't have the power we have but we
[1:07:29] do give it to him we do give it to him
[1:07:35] alright where's my note all down through
[1:07:39] the Old Testament it was actual siap our
[1:07:45] David Haddix will see a power Samson had
[1:07:48] XO see a power they didn't have Dunamis
[1:07:51] sure it was that listen don't get me
[1:07:52] wrong it was the Holy Ghost anointing
[1:07:54] him but it couldn't go down and give
[1:07:55] them inherit power it could give them
[1:07:57] authority to do what they needed to do
[1:08:00] which was what now listen a sociopath is
[1:08:03] not bad it's bad if you keep it that way
[1:08:06] but when you receive Dunamis power it
[1:08:09] does away with EXO sia listen you and I
[1:08:14] got to realize something when we come to
[1:08:17] a place that we have Dunamis power which
[1:08:19] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:08:21] the person remember all those sermons we
[1:08:23] preached on the I am that's where that
[1:08:26] person is that I am guy is inside of you
[1:08:30] [Applause]
[1:08:32] jesus said before Abraham was I am but
[1:08:38] it wasn't anybody else the Holy Ghost
[1:08:42] was not given in the Old Testament so
[1:08:43] there was actually a power there was
[1:08:45] power that would drop down it would
[1:08:47] anoint for a time now I didn't anoint
[1:08:51] Moses to kill an Egyptian you can't hang
[1:08:54] that on God but he had the authority to
[1:08:59] do what God said amen that's why I'm
[1:09:04] telling you that's why that the
[1:09:06] denominations are even Satan King have
[1:09:09] authority and you think it is Dunamis
[1:09:12] power because it's really close really
[1:09:17] close but one is an inherent one comes
[1:09:21] from right deep down inside the other
[1:09:24] one comes from on top of you and anoint
[1:09:27] you so the Old Testament had an
[1:09:29] anointing or a permitted power to do
[1:09:33] what they needed to do for a time but
[1:09:35] listen Dunamis power is not something to
[1:09:38] be given and taken away when you inherit
[1:09:42] something especially when you inherit
[1:09:45] from God he's not an Indian giver
[1:09:47] you don't give it to him take it back
[1:09:49] now he can give you XO sin take it back
[1:09:51] because he does it all the time he did
[1:09:53] it was the first horde Rider second
[1:09:55] horse riders he let him go to a certain
[1:09:57] point and stop he let Satan go to a
[1:09:59] certain point and stop but now with
[1:10:04] Dunamis power who stops Dunamis power
[1:10:07] you and I do you and I stopped that
[1:10:10] power listen more mercy not even got
[1:10:16] started good so the prophets were
[1:10:19] anointed now we know it was the power of
[1:10:21] God because what they spoke the power
[1:10:26] that we have now the Dunamis power is is
[1:10:29] energized by the word I just should read
[1:10:31] you the quote because you can't just and
[1:10:36] I love what God did because he's soul
[1:10:38] he's so wonderful he didn't just come
[1:10:40] out and go alright you and do whatever
[1:10:41] you want to do I'm gonna just give you
[1:10:44] power there's always the word the word
[1:10:50] even Jesus Christ who was Dunamis power
[1:10:52] he didn't receive it he hey was it he
[1:10:55] had to stay in the grave for a certain
[1:10:56] length of time amen he had to sleep he
[1:11:01] had to eat he had to do these things and
[1:11:03] his humanity that you would think well
[1:11:05] if he had Dunamis power but now remember
[1:11:08] there was a time when Jesus was telling
[1:11:11] the people different things that was
[1:11:13] going to happen Matthew I mean John 14
[1:11:17] 15 16 17 but in Matthew 28:18 Jesus came
[1:11:21] up and said all power I have now
[1:11:25] unlimited power
[1:11:29] because I am now body spirit and soul
[1:11:35] eternal that same spirit everybody get a
[1:11:45] surprised look on her face he's in you
[1:11:47] now Romans 8 says if the same spirit
[1:11:52] brother Nick's
[1:11:53] one of the brother dates favorite
[1:11:55] Scripture if the same spirit that raised
[1:11:57] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:12:00] it will quicken your mortal body that's
[1:12:05] not EXO SIA though that's Dunamis that's
[1:12:07] coming from right down inside of here
[1:12:09] there will nobody will get a body change
[1:12:12] from EXO she'll call this power given
[1:12:16] and power for taking back power given
[1:12:17] but dunno Dunamis power we gotta realize
[1:12:20] this when God gave us that power he's
[1:12:22] not taking it back you know what he
[1:12:26] don't want it back he wants you to enjoy
[1:12:29] it they been okay with that he wants you
[1:12:34] to enjoy it but that transfer of power
[1:12:36] one day came back it was creative power
[1:12:43] in the beginning and then when Gabriel
[1:12:47] came to Mary and said Mary you're gonna
[1:12:50] be overshadowed by doing by Dunamis hey
[1:12:54] man you're gonna be overshadowed by the
[1:12:56] same Dunamis that created the world and
[1:12:59] I'm gonna create in you and the Bible
[1:13:02] calls it a thing uh-huh
[1:13:05] that thing conceived in you is conceived
[1:13:08] by the what Holy Ghost
[1:13:11] Dunamis but remember as we've spoken
[1:13:14] before brother berm tells us Mary wanton
[1:13:17] Dunamis she didn't have Dunamis power at
[1:13:19] the time she was just bringing a baby
[1:13:22] she was just an oven she was an
[1:13:23] incubator she was bringing the thing
[1:13:25] forth but what was born of her
[1:13:28] what's Dunamis power that was the man
[1:13:31] himself not a second person or third
[1:13:34] person if I okay with that but that
[1:13:38] creative power came to Mary and what
[1:13:41] happened is John 1:1 stepped into this
[1:13:47] dimension in the beginning was Word Word
[1:13:51] was with God the Word was God
[1:13:55] then John 14 and that Dunamis stepped
[1:13:59] into flesh and dwelt among us now what'd
[1:14:05] I tell you about that do you think about
[1:14:06] Jesus or you think about yourself that's
[1:14:08] the same way happened to you you walk
[1:14:11] around in flesh one day and we were
[1:14:13] doing
[1:14:13] of the flesh one day and the flesh was
[1:14:15] taking over all the things we were doing
[1:14:16] because we had a carnal nature the
[1:14:18] things we were doing we're not of God
[1:14:20] but when Dunamis power came in it's
[1:14:24] supposed to change you I said it's
[1:14:26] supposed to change you and turn you into
[1:14:29] a Christian all right let's look at this
[1:14:32] right here though that power then was
[1:14:36] transferred God worked
[1:14:38] we're like brother Aaron said God had to
[1:14:40] have you know God don't need anything
[1:14:44] and to me this shows the sovereignty of
[1:14:47] God more than anything God doesn't need
[1:14:49] us to survive he doesn't need us to do
[1:14:51] anything but he does need us to
[1:14:54] reproduce herself he does you said God
[1:15:00] don't need not no he doesn't but he does
[1:15:02] he decided in his plan he decided to
[1:15:07] need a female he decided to need a bride
[1:15:11] that he was not just going to have a
[1:15:14] bride and just leave her there no he
[1:15:21] said I'm not only gonna make a bride I'm
[1:15:24] gonna just step over in her and I'm
[1:15:27] going to destroy the effects of the
[1:15:30] devil and I'm gonna be standing up here
[1:15:32] right beside leaven we're gonna be
[1:15:33] talking side-by-side and all this is
[1:15:34] going on down here in the world and the
[1:15:36] Bride of Christ is just walking right
[1:15:38] into the word and Satan can't do
[1:15:42] anything about it because you can't have
[1:15:45] EXO see a power over Dunamis power amen
[1:15:49] so the transfer of power now has what
[1:15:52] it's Jesus here let me ask you a
[1:15:54] question is Jesus Christ here
[1:15:56] hold on it's Jesus costing human flesh
[1:15:59] here ah one more time as Jesus Christ in
[1:16:04] human flesh here well why don't we sit
[1:16:06] down here the physical Lord Jesus is not
[1:16:12] here you know that but watch what the
[1:16:16] scripture says in Matthew 26 verse 64
[1:16:18] we'll get back to her our transfer of
[1:16:22] power though came when on the day of
[1:16:25] Pentecost that was the transfer of power
[1:16:29] God had held it he had walked on the
[1:16:31] earth for three and a half year or 30
[1:16:33] years but three and a half years of
[1:16:35] ministry and then he leaves and he tells
[1:16:39] us all these great and wonderful things
[1:16:41] where'd he go
[1:16:41] jesus said unto Him thou have said
[1:16:44] nevertheless I say unto you hereafter
[1:16:48] shall you see the Son of man now the son
[1:16:51] of man is God in human flesh not son of
[1:16:56] God he said you shall see or understand
[1:17:01] where the son of man is going to be may
[1:17:05] I paraphrase ma'am is that okay is that
[1:17:09] not what that says I'm well let me read
[1:17:12] it the way it says it then for those of
[1:17:14] you that are doubters hereafter shall
[1:17:15] you see the Son of man sitting on the
[1:17:18] right hand of power and coming in the
[1:17:21] clouds of heaven we're living that we're
[1:17:26] living revelations 10:17
[1:17:29] right but what are we seeing we're
[1:17:33] seeing the Son of man sitting on the
[1:17:35] right hand not brother BAM said it's not
[1:17:38] it's not the right hand but you know
[1:17:41] what it is it's a human man it's a human
[1:17:47] that once was a human mortal man it's
[1:17:51] standing in a dimension not this
[1:17:56] dimension but he has transferred all
[1:17:58] that power now if he kept it we don't
[1:18:03] have it exactly but on the day of
[1:18:07] Pentecost he took that right hand
[1:18:09] because
[1:18:10] what did he do when he brought that
[1:18:11] power or Dunamis on the day of Pentecost
[1:18:14] he transferred it to the last piece of
[1:18:17] the Gentiles it was going to get in
[1:18:18] there we know he's got to go the Jews
[1:18:20] but he's he delivered it on that day and
[1:18:23] Stephen when they stoned him what the
[1:18:26] world happened that dimension opened up
[1:18:28] before he got ready to die and he said I
[1:18:30] see Jesus standing on the right hand of
[1:18:35] God listen Stephen wasn't seeing it
[1:18:40] where he had to go to it he saw where it
[1:18:43] was at he saw he was in the throne room
[1:18:46] in his soul and when that dimension
[1:18:49] broke out he said that's where I'm going
[1:18:51] so he transferred the power to me and
[1:18:56] you know what says or a position that
[1:19:01] right hand of power we know that's a
[1:19:02] position all right real quick let's go
[1:19:05] to Matthew 28 let's read in Matthew
[1:19:07] 28:18 I think it's the next one Jesus
[1:19:09] came and spake unto them saying all
[1:19:11] power now he lied if that's not the
[1:19:16] truth all power in heaven earth all
[1:19:21] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:19:24] earth now when he goes to the right hand
[1:19:25] of power he should've kept it
[1:19:29] it was his Amen it was his but he had
[1:19:35] told him so many times that he's going
[1:19:38] to send something back
[1:19:41] let's read here in Luke 4 verse 32 now
[1:19:50] this is he's getting ready to ascend but
[1:19:52] what does he say watch this and behold I
[1:19:56] send the promise of my father unto you
[1:20:00] so he's telling him right then
[1:20:02] look I'm not keeping this I need you to
[1:20:08] have it because in my in John 17 he
[1:20:12] prayed that we would be one as he and
[1:20:15] the father were one and the only way you
[1:20:17] can do that is have Dunamis power cuz
[1:20:20] it's the same power all the way across
[1:20:22] listen the father don't have this much
[1:20:24] do know it's not a graph the father
[1:20:26] don't have this Dunamis power and Jesus
[1:20:28] had this much and we got this bunch all
[1:20:32] pirate Hitler has been given unto me
[1:20:33] he's got the full load but he takes that
[1:20:36] full load and he transfers it right down
[1:20:37] to me and you they meant cuz listen keep
[1:20:41] keep keep going remember keeping the
[1:20:43] back to your mind word revival word
[1:20:48] revival alright let's go to UM Luke I'm
[1:20:53] a missile in there let me get back over
[1:20:56] here let's go back you're all right Joe
[1:21:00] you're on your right okay what was look
[1:21:02] I will send the promise of my father
[1:21:05] what is that promise that was the
[1:21:09] promise that the Old Testament Saints
[1:21:11] couldn't get amen that's the promise of
[1:21:15] my father I'm going to send it not on a
[1:21:19] piece of paper I'm gonna set it in human
[1:21:22] beings and tarry in Jerusalem until you
[1:21:27] be endued with power are Dunamis from on
[1:21:32] high this is a good part if I can get
[1:21:37] get it all together here okay look let's
[1:21:39] go to acts 1 verse 7 and 8 I love the
[1:21:43] scripture of now watch and he's telling
[1:21:47] the limit is not for you to know the
[1:21:48] times or the seasons which the father
[1:21:50] have put in his own power but you shall
[1:21:57] receive power now is that two different
[1:22:01] powers no that's not actually in Dunamis
[1:22:04] that's Dunamis all the way across but ye
[1:22:06] shall receive power after right that's
[1:22:12] why brother Brown said he said those
[1:22:13] denominations are cold formal and
[1:22:17] powerless without the baptism of the
[1:22:21] Holy Ghost you are powerless against the
[1:22:23] devil but ye shall receive Dunamis after
[1:22:29] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and
[1:22:31] ye shall be witnesses unto me now what
[1:22:35] are they
[1:22:35] witnessing his word in Jerusalem Judea
[1:22:41] Samaria to the uttermost parts of the
[1:22:43] earth thank God that under most part
[1:22:44] said the United States of America
[1:22:46] well that's me and you but you shall
[1:22:50] receive power and that power is
[1:22:52] listening go to then you can go to them
[1:22:54] that's Dunamis power inherent power
[1:22:58] power residing anything by virtue of its
[1:23:02] nature now we having the nature of the
[1:23:07] devil Dunamis can't it get it and get in
[1:23:10] there we can have EXO Co though does it
[1:23:14] annoyance its Authority you can have you
[1:23:17] can have EXO see a power but you can't
[1:23:20] have Dunamis power unless it's inside of
[1:23:22] you inherent power power residing in the
[1:23:26] theme by virtue of its nature or which a
[1:23:28] person or thing what oh we're supposed
[1:23:31] to show it exerts and puts forth power
[1:23:39] for performing miracles moral power and
[1:23:42] excellence of soul how do we show it
[1:23:45] brother dick tell how you sure you sure
[1:23:47] by the Word of God you show it by what
[1:23:49] what you are because you remember you
[1:23:52] are the Word made flesh by Dunamis power
[1:23:56] he has transferred everything he said
[1:23:59] into me and you but still we limited by
[1:24:08] our own ideas just read Romans 13 verse
[1:24:12] 1 and 2 let every soul be subject unto
[1:24:17] the higher powers all right for there is
[1:24:21] no power but of God hmm even EXO sia
[1:24:28] permitted power comes from God because
[1:24:30] remember Satan has zero power zero
[1:24:33] because he can't reproduce himself he
[1:24:35] can't create you and I but our creators
[1:24:41] Oh Lord yeah whoo so therefore look the
[1:24:46] powers that be are ordained of God so
[1:24:49] there's you to power there's no power of
[1:24:51] God but there's powers that are a Dane
[1:24:53] of God listen
[1:24:54] Satan was ordained to do what he was
[1:24:57] supposed to do that's what the Bible
[1:24:59] says he had a job to do and God let him
[1:25:02] do it
[1:25:03] whosoever therefore resisteth the power
[1:25:06] resisteth the or now watch the ordinance
[1:25:10] of God the word not the pots not the
[1:25:14] cleaning of this and not the sacrifice
[1:25:16] is the word the word is the ordinance so
[1:25:21] where do we get in trouble by resisting
[1:25:23] the word and they that resist shall
[1:25:26] receive to themselves damnation boy
[1:25:30] pretty tough that's that's a mouthful
[1:25:38] all right let's go to Romans 1:16 Paul
[1:25:42] says now look where is this power for I
[1:25:47] am not ashamed of the gospel or word of
[1:25:52] Christ for it is the power it is the
[1:25:57] Dunamis of God unto salvation to
[1:26:00] everyone that believeth to the Jew first
[1:26:03] and also to the Greeks
[1:26:05] let's keep reading we'll get finished in
[1:26:08] a minute Luke 4 verse 32 watch what he
[1:26:11] says right here and they were astonished
[1:26:13] as at his doctrine for his word was with
[1:26:18] power everywhere he went that's why he
[1:26:23] never had to scream at a demon because
[1:26:25] he had Dunamis power there's a lot of
[1:26:28] XOC a power that tries to scream at
[1:26:30] demons and they ain't gonna move hello
[1:26:33] they're not gonna move but when you have
[1:26:37] denim's power when you walk up and and
[1:26:41] that's demon speaks to you and since
[1:26:44] what are you doing here why have you
[1:26:47] come to torment me before my time and
[1:26:50] they that's what's kind of weird you
[1:26:51] know it's really not weird but the devil
[1:26:54] at the Legion Jesus walks up to the
[1:26:57] Legion
[1:26:58] he had just he had just been in the
[1:27:00] temple in Jerusalem and they called him
[1:27:02] a devil they called the Son of God or
[1:27:05] devil right belzebub now he walks in
[1:27:09] front of a demon legion and the first
[1:27:11] thing leads and says why are you the son
[1:27:14] of God now you're here you're not
[1:27:17] supposed to be here until the devil knew
[1:27:20] he was the son of God and the people
[1:27:22] that was supposed to bend the religious
[1:27:23] people in the world calling him a devil
[1:27:25] how weird for his word was with power
[1:27:29] 1st corinthians 1 verse 18 for the
[1:27:32] preaching of the Cross is to them that
[1:27:36] perish foolishness but unto us take that
[1:27:42] finger now and do that and be happy
[1:27:43] about it and to us which are saved it is
[1:27:49] the Dunamis of God
[1:27:56] 1st Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God
[1:28:00] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:01] which according to his abundant mercy
[1:28:02] has begotten us begotten us children
[1:28:08] begotten us again unto a lively hope by
[1:28:13] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[1:28:15] the dead there's your two an inheritance
[1:28:18] the Dunamis power to an inheritance
[1:28:20] incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[1:28:23] not away reserved in heaven for you now
[1:28:25] you say it's reserved in heaven if we're
[1:28:28] sitting in heavenly places were right in
[1:28:29] the middle of it we're on the middle of
[1:28:31] it who are kept by the power of Dunamis
[1:28:37] power of God through faith unto
[1:28:41] salvation ready to be revealed today the
[1:28:48] right right in you now you can take that
[1:28:50] thing and do the same thing goes listen
[1:28:52] the full revelation is not till now this
[1:28:55] is the full revelation of that Dunamis
[1:28:57] power because remember that Dunamis
[1:28:59] power is so powerful it creates worlds
[1:29:02] and it changed Jesus's body but it
[1:29:05] hasn't changed nobody's body but
[1:29:08] it has been limited by the word that
[1:29:09] they've held but now we have no excuse
[1:29:13] for words been given so in Revelations 8
[1:29:20] let's read just for a minute here go
[1:29:25] back to XOC revelation 6 verse 8 says I
[1:29:27] looked and behold a pale horse and his
[1:29:28] name that sat on him was death and hell
[1:29:30] followed with him and power was given
[1:29:32] now that power in the Bible is Exodia
[1:29:35] our authority or power of choice our
[1:29:37] physical and mental power the ability of
[1:29:39] strength which one is in dude right so
[1:29:43] Pyle was given you look through all the
[1:29:45] Book of Revelations power was given
[1:29:47] power was given power was given power
[1:29:49] was given power was given he doesn't
[1:29:51] talk that about Jesus and didn't talk
[1:29:53] talked about the bride that's the devil
[1:29:55] that's given power if you're born again
[1:29:58] you have the power power is not being
[1:30:01] given to us folks if you're born again
[1:30:03] you have the power inside of you already
[1:30:07] to create a world and go live on I look
[1:30:11] at Romans 1 verse 24 the invisible
[1:30:13] things of him from the creation of the
[1:30:16] world are clearly seen how much more in
[1:30:20] the end time being understood by the
[1:30:22] things that are made even his eternal
[1:30:25] power us thinking about this when I read
[1:30:27] that scripture listen his power would
[1:30:30] the only thing you and I can think of in
[1:30:32] power wise is something has to generate
[1:30:36] it and it ends and flows it goes up it
[1:30:41] goes down it goes up you have a lot of
[1:30:43] power in the battery and then all of a
[1:30:44] sudden you can use the battery and then
[1:30:46] you have no more power you have to do
[1:30:48] something to give it more power this you
[1:30:52] don't when he created the world that set
[1:30:55] in motion everything to look at the
[1:30:57] future home what is God's gonna you know
[1:30:59] we're not gonna have to rebuild stuff in
[1:31:02] the future home now we may in a
[1:31:04] millennium because that's not all
[1:31:05] Dunamis power we're gonna have it but
[1:31:10] the world's not gonna have it
[1:31:11] but in the future home everything has it
[1:31:14] and we're not gonna have to rebuild and
[1:31:17] cut down trees and I don't know how
[1:31:19] that's gonna work but you know what
[1:31:21] we're not gonna be crowded we're not
[1:31:22] gonna have to have a mechanic or a HVAC
[1:31:27] guy or that's what Dunamis power is
[1:31:30] folks it's unlimited power unlimited
[1:31:35] it's only limited by the Word of God and
[1:31:37] you even his eternal power and Godhead
[1:31:42] and when I was reading this a little
[1:31:46] light came on because look see what kind
[1:31:50] of power you got when you have the
[1:31:51] Godhead right that's why the prophet of
[1:31:54] God had to come in in time to give us
[1:31:56] the correct interpretation of the
[1:31:58] Godhead because Father Son Holy Ghost
[1:32:02] has no Dunamis power it has that socio
[1:32:07] power Dunamis power remember brother
[1:32:11] Brown said I just want to see how this
[1:32:12] would work he said in the name of the
[1:32:13] Father Son Holy Ghost talk to that demon
[1:32:16] and head the table up off the ground and
[1:32:18] all that stuff you know he said in the
[1:32:19] name of the Father Son Holy Ghost he
[1:32:21] said he'd never move why that was xoc a
[1:32:24] power that was just a given power but
[1:32:26] when he said in the name of the Lord
[1:32:27] Jesus Christ he said leave this room
[1:32:30] that table he said hit the ground
[1:32:32] well we had to God we got the Godhead
[1:32:35] right that's my brother Brahma is it's
[1:32:39] it's it's very powerful what he says and
[1:32:42] sometimes you don't understand if a
[1:32:43] brother Brown said that doctrine came
[1:32:45] from the pits of hell the Father Son
[1:32:49] Holy Ghost doctrine came from the pits
[1:32:51] of hell it never was a doctrine created
[1:32:53] by God it was not ever never had any
[1:32:57] Dunamis power now look even though it
[1:33:01] was written in the word it was hidden
[1:33:04] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:33:06] and revealed to babe such as will learn
[1:33:12] Philippians 3 verse 10 and be found in
[1:33:16] him not having mine own righteousness
[1:33:17] I'm almost finished which is of the law
[1:33:20] but that which is through the faith of
[1:33:23] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[1:33:25] by faith that I may know him and the
[1:33:29] Dunamis of his resurrection listen
[1:33:34] you can't that's why even though the
[1:33:37] foolish virgin is anointed by XOC of
[1:33:40] power our could be even anointed by
[1:33:43] Dunamis power anointed because they're
[1:33:45] virgins
[1:33:46] it never resided in them and it can't
[1:33:48] bring them out of her in a resurrection
[1:33:50] Dunamis power will bring you out of the
[1:33:52] ground hexose their power will not bring
[1:33:56] you out of the ground doesn't have
[1:33:57] enough power because Satan can't
[1:33:59] resurrect Satan do a lot of things but
[1:34:01] he only does it because God permits the
[1:34:03] power for him to do it
[1:34:04] then I may know him and the power of his
[1:34:07] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[1:34:10] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:34:12] his death all right look second Timothy
[1:34:17] 1:7 through 10 then I'm going to read
[1:34:21] you two quotes and we'll be done then
[1:34:22] we'll take communion in foot washing for
[1:34:28] God hath not given us this is brother
[1:34:30] Ernie's favorite scripture I guess
[1:34:33] you'll probably hear it Sunday don't
[1:34:37] stand up and say we've already heard
[1:34:38] that for God has not given us the spirit
[1:34:41] of fear but of Dunamis pop that power
[1:34:45] not exosphere power Dunamis power and of
[1:34:49] love and of a sound mind be not there
[1:34:52] therefore ashamed of the testimony what
[1:34:54] of the word of our Lord nor of me his
[1:34:57] prisoner but be thou partaker of the
[1:35:01] afflictions of the Gospel according to
[1:35:05] the power of God so the gospel is what
[1:35:09] has the power of God that's why we're
[1:35:11] looking for a word revival God will only
[1:35:15] come back in Dunamis power not EXO SIL
[1:35:22] and where is Dunamis power is not in the
[1:35:25] leaves it's not in the trees it's not in
[1:35:27] the bench or setting in it's in you
[1:35:32] there's not even Dunamis power in that
[1:35:34] Bible anything that's words
[1:35:41] but if you got doing too much power in
[1:35:43] you you'll know what to read to feed
[1:35:45] that word to feed that power with who
[1:35:48] has saved us and called us with a holy
[1:35:50] calling not according to our works but
[1:35:52] according to his own purpose and grace
[1:35:54] which was given to us in Christ Jesus
[1:35:55] when before the world began we can t
[1:35:59] lose two quotes let's read the last two
[1:36:06] across the mystery of God revealed in
[1:36:07] the end time seat sign we read him a
[1:36:10] couple of Sundays ago but I think we're
[1:36:11] gonna read again cuz watch mm-hmm and
[1:36:15] let me let me set the stage here God is
[1:36:19] it's waiting on us
[1:36:20] all right that's brother Dale Sam but
[1:36:25] the reason he's waiting on us because
[1:36:26] he's waiting on us he's not waiting on
[1:36:29] itself through a prophet some 60 almost
[1:36:34] years ago 57 years ago now he spoke this
[1:36:38] about you there's no Dunamis power out
[1:36:43] here now the Dunamis power it's not in a
[1:36:45] denomination I've told y'all before the
[1:36:48] the power of the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:50] Ghost is only in the elect lady in the
[1:36:53] end time does everybody understand that
[1:36:55] say ma'am only in us look God in his
[1:37:02] body Christ and Christ in his by look
[1:37:06] God put the power in Christ Dunamis
[1:37:10] power Christ takes the Dunamis power and
[1:37:13] gives it to us the bride oh oh oh my God
[1:37:16] made manifest in Christ Christ made
[1:37:19] manifest in the bride and as God took
[1:37:22] from the body of Adam the woman and she
[1:37:24] fell then God has took from the body of
[1:37:27] Christ his flesh his body which is his
[1:37:31] word and is bringing a bride out that
[1:37:35] won't fall by denomination or creed no
[1:37:40] sir but she is coming back with the pure
[1:37:44] unadulterated Word of God being manifest
[1:37:49] I hope every man that hears this
[1:37:54] tape and every woman will understand
[1:37:57] that see she is the second e but she is
[1:38:01] not breaking and spoiling her skirts of
[1:38:03] purity and holiness to her husband in
[1:38:06] other words she's not working under XOC
[1:38:08] of power at all zero listen if you've
[1:38:12] got the baptism of the holy ghost this
[1:38:14] revival that we're talking about it's
[1:38:16] not EXO see a power coming to Dunamis
[1:38:18] power you can't bring lower power and
[1:38:21] make higher power work it's just knowing
[1:38:24] that what you've got already it's
[1:38:29] already in the bank start drawing the
[1:38:31] dividends she'll stay with his word
[1:38:37] regardless of what anybody says you can
[1:38:41] have all the ecumenical moves you want
[1:38:43] to and all the affiliations let's read
[1:38:46] the last one in time seed signed Tifton
[1:38:49] Georgia and I believe that these
[1:38:51] latter-day signs and things that's
[1:38:53] happening every one of them is peeling
[1:38:55] together to show that Christ is ready to
[1:38:59] come for his bride as God in His Word
[1:39:02] made manifest in a man a perfect man all
[1:39:07] right everybody got that
[1:39:08] a perfect man so is God and His Word
[1:39:12] coming and making an imperfect bride huh
[1:39:17] Oh God and His Word made manifest in a
[1:39:20] man a perfect man that same Dunamis
[1:39:23] power is God in His Word coming again
[1:39:26] and making himself manifest in a bride
[1:39:31] not will do like Eve did highbreed it to
[1:39:34] something else but the unadulterated
[1:39:37] Word of God will be born into that
[1:39:40] church and she'll stand like Jesus
[1:39:44] Christ did with his spirit anointing in
[1:39:48] his word amen I believe it is the
[1:39:52] announcement now I've been let me read
[1:39:55] that again I believe it's the
[1:39:57] announcement now it took a prophet to
[1:40:02] bring it but she takes me and you to
[1:40:04] believe it the standard fee
[1:40:08] so what are we looking for yes good to
[1:40:11] have h socia but that won't get you our
[1:40:14] grave right that won't change your body
[1:40:17] but Dunamis power will do that it will
[1:40:21] bring you out I promise you cuz it you
[1:40:23] know what it done it brought Jesus out
[1:40:25] of a grave and now what's it gonna do he
[1:40:29] says all powered heaven earth been given
[1:40:30] unto me and now I'm transferring that
[1:40:32] power to them last two quotes to the
[1:40:35] bride everybody got that same n-word
[1:40:41] revival the word back in power alright
[1:40:45] the brothers come on you won't do them
[1:40:53] and while we're can't get it in the
[1:40:56] water baptism scripture um while we're
[1:41:01] raw we've got everything ready while
[1:41:04] we're waiting let's just bow our heads
[1:41:06] if you got a need in your heart and if
[1:41:09] you got a sickness in your body today we
[1:41:14] look to the Word of God we look to the
[1:41:15] promise that God has promised us so if
[1:41:19] you got a need just raise your hand I
[1:41:21] know we all do we all have needs and we
[1:41:24] we've all got people that are running
[1:41:26] through our mind right now that need
[1:41:28] prayer that need salvation that need
[1:41:30] healing well you know what you can't go
[1:41:33] by that Dunamis power it's already
[1:41:37] inside of you you don't have to work it
[1:41:40] up brother Branham says you got to bring
[1:41:45] it down so they don't the word that you
[1:41:49] already are if you're born again today
[1:41:50] you're the word you're the word made
[1:41:52] flesh you just need a revival of what's
[1:41:55] already inside of you so let's pray for
[1:41:57] a minute do you have any father thank
[1:41:58] you for this day all of us that standing
[1:42:01] here in this building Lord we all have
[1:42:02] needs we all have family in the members
[1:42:05] that need salvation we all have somebody
[1:42:09] and on our heart that needs healing Lord
[1:42:12] we still are needy people even though
[1:42:15] you've give us this power Lord let us
[1:42:18] let us release that power
[1:42:20] let us not Dam it up like man has took
[1:42:23] these beautiful rivers around here and
[1:42:25] put downs and dammed them up and kept
[1:42:27] them from flowing free Lord the river of
[1:42:30] life won't have a dam in it the River of
[1:42:32] Life won't have a place where it narrows
[1:42:35] and is clogged up and oh that's what's
[1:42:37] happening now by our unbelief but Lord
[1:42:40] it will flow freely I pray that you'll
[1:42:43] give us right now a little taste of that
[1:42:45] future home that you'll give us Lord a
[1:42:47] little taste of where we're about to go
[1:42:49] to father that there's something right
[1:42:52] on the brink of happening I just believe
[1:42:54] Lord where we've entered in a new decade
[1:42:56] this is 2020 I don't believe in my heart
[1:42:59] we'll see 2030 I believe that this is
[1:43:02] the decade of us going home we're going
[1:43:05] to leave this place Lord and we pray
[1:43:08] father that the ones that do not have
[1:43:10] this Dunamis power that Lord that you
[1:43:13] will just stir their heart and Lord just
[1:43:16] be that balm in Gilead that that we have
[1:43:20] many needs of maybe hurt feelings and
[1:43:24] different things Lord you you said you
[1:43:26] wouldn't leave us comfortless that you
[1:43:29] would come to us father forgive us of
[1:43:31] our sins as we're about to partake of
[1:43:32] this communion it's a true
[1:43:34] representation Lord that we're a part of
[1:43:37] you and that we're gonna commune with
[1:43:40] you now not just for a few minutes this
[1:43:43] is just a symbol that we're already
[1:43:44] communing with you in the days and weeks
[1:43:47] ahead Lord may we commune more may we
[1:43:50] cut out the things that we don't need
[1:43:52] and spend more time with you Lord
[1:43:57] because you're the one with the Dunamis
[1:44:00] power and it will never ever lose its
[1:44:05] strength what a promise man is tried for
[1:44:11] centuries Lord to create power they've
[1:44:16] done it by different things and and and
[1:44:19] in damming up rivers and and turning
[1:44:22] turbines and spending billions of
[1:44:24] dollars and solar panels to create
[1:44:27] electricity and all you do is just walk
[1:44:29] out and say my powers in my word
[1:44:33] Dunamis power Lord may we receive it
[1:44:37] today give us this day truly our daily
[1:44:39] bread amen
[1:44:42] let's read the scripture first
[1:44:44] Corinthians 4 I have received of the
[1:44:46] Lord that which I delivered unto you
[1:44:47] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:44:50] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:44:51] when he had given thanks he brake it and
[1:44:53] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:44:55] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:44:58] me after the manner also he took the cup
[1:45:00] which he had supped saying this cup is
[1:45:02] the New Testament you see the New
[1:45:05] Testament the Old Testament wasn't
[1:45:08] anointing that God would anoint a group
[1:45:13] of people and then they would come off
[1:45:14] home and no but this but the New
[1:45:16] Testament is in his blood the New
[1:45:19] Testament is in the life that he was
[1:45:22] going to send back 11 days later twelve
[1:45:25] thirteen days later on the day of
[1:45:27] Pentecost when he was speaking this
[1:45:29] right here this cup is the New Testament
[1:45:32] that's why we've always said you were so
[1:45:36] dogmatic about it and I guess we are the
[1:45:37] New Testament didn't start until after
[1:45:39] Jesus died he had to die he just said
[1:45:42] right here the cup is the New Testament
[1:45:44] in my blood this do ye as oft as you
[1:45:47] drink it right and remembrance of me so
[1:45:49] every time we drink it we remember that
[1:45:51] he gave his life and that life didn't
[1:45:54] just go somewhere and stay he came right
[1:45:57] back down here into this dimension again
[1:45:59] as the Holy Ghost out into his full into
[1:46:03] the believers as often as you eat this
[1:46:06] bread and drink this cup you do show the
[1:46:07] Lord's death till he come where so
[1:46:10] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:46:12] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:46:14] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:46:16] and blood of the Lord the body and the
[1:46:19] blood of the Lord but let a man examine
[1:46:21] himself if you have a problem today you
[1:46:23] need to examine yourself right now we'll
[1:46:24] stop in a few minutes and have a silent
[1:46:26] word of Prayer you pray for the pastor
[1:46:28] and you pray that if you've got
[1:46:29] something in your life that God will
[1:46:31] wipe it out anybody would he said he
[1:46:33] would but let a man examine himself and
[1:46:36] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:46:38] of that Cup for he that eateth and
[1:46:40] drinketh unworthily this and drink the
[1:46:41] damnation to himself not discerning the
[1:46:43] Lord's body now who's the Lord's body
[1:46:45] you an hour
[1:46:47] right for this cause many are weak and
[1:46:49] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:46:52] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:46:54] be judged if we would judge ourselves we
[1:46:56] will not be judged but when we are
[1:46:57] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:47:00] we should not be condemned with the
[1:47:02] world wherefore my brethren you see how
[1:47:05] we've been separated we're not gonna be
[1:47:07] condemned by the Lord with the world
[1:47:09] because that Dunamis power overcomes
[1:47:13] everything Jesus said I have overcome
[1:47:16] the world what do you say it with he
[1:47:17] said it was Dunamis power the same power
[1:47:19] you got inside of you
[1:47:20] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:47:22] together to eat tarry one for another if
[1:47:24] any man hunger let him eat at home that
[1:47:28] you come not together into condemnation
[1:47:29] and the rest wants it in order when I
[1:47:32] come let's just have a moment of silent
[1:47:34] prayer praying for the pastor praying
[1:47:37] for if you have anything in your life
[1:47:38] that you need to get rid of now it's a
[1:47:41] real good time to get rid of it so let's
[1:47:43] bow our heads
