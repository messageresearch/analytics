[1:02] commit ourselves to you now in this time
[1:04] into your hands we ask you these things
[1:06] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08] Christ
[1:13] amen all right well it's good to be in
[1:15] in the house of the
[1:17] Lord once again we have some uh some
[1:21] some
[1:22] visitors uh we have Sister Sister Marie
[1:25] she's visiting with us she's already
[1:27] been visiting with us for a few weeks
[1:29] but that was good to have have her here
[1:30] at Sunday school with us and uh so uh
[1:34] and I think her children are here with
[1:35] us her children over there
[1:38] too um and then we also have uh she's
[1:41] not a visitor they're not visitors
[1:43] anymore but we do actually one of them
[1:45] is a visitor Caleb and uh Caleb brother
[1:49] Caleb and Sister Christina sister Grace
[1:51] and sister shakaron they're all from
[1:53] Brother jeene Williams Church in in
[1:55] Anderson South Carolina so it's good to
[1:57] have him here with us
[2:00] it was a surprise when they when they
[2:01] said that they were going to come down
[2:03] so was good to have them here with
[2:06] us amen so we're going to talk this
[2:09] morning if you want to turn to your
[2:10] scriptures or you can look on here uh
[2:12] this morning about Victorious love amen
[2:16] and uh yesterday I was I was just sort
[2:18] of looking through um you know sometimes
[2:21] we sometimes we think well ministers
[2:23] should already just have you know
[2:25] messages just flowing back and forth
[2:27] through their mind constantly well it's
[2:29] not that way come
[2:31] on that's what people think but but it's
[2:33] really not it's really not that way
[2:35] sometimes you have to struggle to to say
[2:37] Lord what it is that you want for you
[2:40] know because what you want is you want
[2:42] what what God wants the people to know
[2:45] amen and what the people are needing to
[2:47] hear at that moment you see it's not
[2:49] really what you want so um and and so I
[2:52] was reading in first John 5 the
[2:55] yesterday morning and I just looking at
[2:58] it and I was thinking you know
[3:00] how important it is amen the love that
[3:03] we have for one another amen and that
[3:07] goes to not just having the love for one
[3:09] another amen because remember the way
[3:11] you love God is the way you're going to
[3:12] love your brother and your sister it's
[3:14] the way you're going to treat your
[3:15] brother and your sister and we're going
[3:17] to see that here in just a moment
[3:19] because remember Jesus said that if you
[3:21] love me you keep my Commandments right
[3:24] but then but then J uh John here takes
[3:27] it one step further and he says if you
[3:29] love The Brethren that means you will
[3:31] keep God's word that means you love God
[3:34] so it all ties in together amen amen and
[3:37] I guess is something you know it's not
[3:38] anything new that we that we're hearing
[3:41] but it's something to just keep in
[3:42] remembrance amen because how important
[3:45] it is the way we treat one another cuz
[3:47] let me tell you it's very easy for us to
[3:49] get down to a point where we get so
[3:52] relaxed with each other that we get to a
[3:54] point where we disrespecting one another
[3:56] right and and that's that's where God
[3:59] does not want to to be because why right
[4:01] that's where Satan starts getting in and
[4:03] then it's a downfall of a church yes so
[4:06] let's just look at this here for just a
[4:08] moment in 1 John chapter
[4:12] 5 says verse one it says whosoever
[4:15] believeth that Jesus is the Christ is
[4:18] born of God Amen and everyone that
[4:21] loveth him that begat loveth him also
[4:25] that is begotten in him I want you to
[4:27] see how how how John is talking about if
[4:30] you love the one that begat obviously we
[4:33] know that's
[4:34] God also you will also love those that
[4:38] are begotten of him as well amen so he's
[4:41] he's he's he's talking about a family
[4:44] here amen begot begotten born of God
[4:47] Amen you my you you're my sister you're
[4:50] my brother amen right I'm begotten if if
[4:54] if I have God in Me amen I'm begotten of
[4:56] God if you have God in you you've
[4:58] begotten of God Amen and so we're part
[5:00] of the same part of the same unit amen
[5:03] part of the same family praise God verse
[5:05] Two by this we know that we love the
[5:07] children of God when we love God and
[5:10] keep his
[5:12] Commandments for this is the love of God
[5:15] that we keep his Commandments and his
[5:17] Commandments are not Grievious and we'll
[5:19] we'll go over here in just a moment what
[5:21] that that word Grievious means for
[5:23] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[5:27] world Amen and this this is the victory
[5:30] that overcometh the world even our
[5:34] faith faith and love they're tied to
[5:37] each other amen who is he that
[5:41] overcometh the world but he that
[5:42] believeth that Jesus is the son of God
[5:45] now I don't I don't understand why maybe
[5:48] somebody can help me but I don't know
[5:50] why why there's a question mark there
[5:52] but uh because to me that sounds like a
[5:54] statement but I always wondered about
[5:56] that why there's a question mark there
[5:58] and every script every Bible I've looked
[5:59] that there's a question mark there so
[6:01] maybe somebody might know why why that
[6:04] why that's there could explain it to me
[6:07] amen now so let's we're just going to go
[6:09] through it at it you know just verse by
[6:11] verse amen let's look at verse one for
[6:14] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[6:16] Christ is born of God Amen yes that's
[6:21] simple amen we can look at we can look
[6:23] at at at John chapter 1 where it says
[6:26] but as many as received him to them gave
[6:29] he power to become the sons of God Amen
[6:33] we have power Amen to we've always been
[6:37] Sons and Daughters of God right but
[6:39] Power there's power in recognizing who
[6:41] you are that's right amen right there's
[6:44] power in knowing that you are a child of
[6:46] God yes and then you're not here to just
[6:49] be here right amen you're here to
[6:52] fulfill his purpose you're healed to
[6:54] fulfill a higher calling than than just
[6:57] you amen and and and so there's there's
[7:01] power in that amen power to become the
[7:04] sons of God I mean in this in this hour
[7:07] amen it's such a privilege to know that
[7:09] we are children of God Amen to know that
[7:12] we have a heavenly father that we are
[7:14] LED and guided LED and and guided by
[7:17] amen through his holy spirit even to
[7:19] them that believe on his name in verse
[7:21] 13 it says which were born not of blood
[7:25] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[7:27] will of man but of God so so you come
[7:30] into this thing amen it wasn't by your
[7:31] own doing right you didn't want to you
[7:34] didn't want to serve
[7:37] God trust me you didn't want to serve
[7:39] God if you would be honest with you
[7:42] that's that's not what we wanted to do
[7:44] sure we wanted to live out in the world
[7:46] and live like the devil we didn't think
[7:49] we were living like the devil but that's
[7:51] what we wanted to do cuz that's what our
[7:53] flesh naturally wants to do wants to do
[7:56] the things of the world and and and to
[7:57] live like the world Amen you want to
[8:00] keep up with the Fashions of the world
[8:01] you want to keep up with the music of
[8:03] the world the trends of the world the
[8:04] things of the world
[8:06] Amen so it's it it's good to know I like
[8:10] the scripture because it lets us know
[8:12] that Lord It's you doing the work in my
[8:14] life that's right it's not me doing the
[8:16] work amen not of blood nor of the will
[8:19] of the flesh not of the will of the
[8:21] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[8:24] Amen
[8:26] so so we see there in 1 John CH 5 amen
[8:30] that and everyone that loveth him that
[8:33] begat loveth him also that is begotten
[8:36] of him so if you love God you're going
[8:39] to love your brother amen if you love
[8:41] God you're going to love your sister
[8:43] amen amen and and I believe it was Jesus
[8:45] that said one time he said that you you
[8:49] you would so much love your brother and
[8:51] your sister that you would lay your life
[8:53] down for them now a lot of people a lot
[8:55] of us think that maybe maybe that's
[8:57] talking about that you're in a situation
[8:59] where they got a gun draw up to their up
[9:01] to their head and and you get in between
[9:03] them and get take the
[9:06] bullet but really that's one thing all
[9:09] right yeah but really the sacrifice that
[9:12] you're taking yes to pray for your
[9:15] brother and your sister when you don't
[9:16] feel like it that's right to forgive
[9:18] your brother and your sister when you
[9:20] don't feel like forgiving them but they
[9:21] wrong you that's right Amen to do
[9:24] something good when that person get on
[9:27] gets on your nerves physically to do
[9:29] something good for them that's right are
[9:32] you willing to lay your life down for
[9:35] their benefit that's right in those
[9:36] areas of our life you see what I'm
[9:39] saying yes not just taking the bullet
[9:41] for them which is good and that's
[9:42] courageous and that's that's that's
[9:44] Hollywood
[9:46] like you know but to but to lay down
[9:50] your life in our everyday dealings with
[9:53] our brothers and your sisters does that
[9:55] make sense yes amen
[9:57] so that's very important important amen
[9:59] that we we think about these things
[10:01] because why brother Dale says amen you
[10:04] want to see God look around you that's
[10:07] right if it's God in you then it's God
[10:10] in
[10:11] Me we should treat one another in a
[10:14] certain in a certain fashion amen
[10:16] there's a certain way that brother that
[10:17] brothers and sisters treat each other
[10:20] amen and in John 8:42 still on on verse
[10:23] one it says Jesus said unto them if God
[10:26] were your father and he was talking to
[10:28] the Pharisees here if God were your
[10:31] father you would love me
[10:34] amen see since God is our father we love
[10:37] him right and and and and not just
[10:41] loving him and and when we look at this
[10:43] here when you look at that word love in
[10:46] every single scripture that I'm telling
[10:47] you right right now even in John first
[10:49] John when you look at the back at the
[10:52] Greek on that word it always goes back
[10:54] to agape love every single time now
[10:58] later on get some time we'll show you a
[11:00] scripture where it actually uses the
[11:02] word
[11:03] ailio and it's the love of the world
[11:06] that's ailio love right but it's not the
[11:09] love of God Amen so if you love me what
[11:12] is loving
[11:13] God well we know God is his word amen
[11:17] loving the word and wanting to to want
[11:20] wanting more of that word amen abiding
[11:23] in him and and staying in that word amen
[11:25] that that that's loving God Amen you
[11:28] want more of him amen because then
[11:30] eventually that word will manifest
[11:32] through your life amen that's right the
[11:34] more the more you feed on it the more it
[11:36] will come come out of you amen the more
[11:39] you feed on the things of the uh uh uh
[11:43] on the physical food of Life eventually
[11:46] might start showing up on
[11:50] you it will eventually
[11:52] show right right same thing with the
[11:55] with the spiritual food amen eventually
[11:57] it's going to show yes if you're feeding
[11:59] on the right things and the holy things
[12:01] of God Amen so and continue here if you
[12:05] if uh if God were your father you would
[12:08] love me for I proceeded forth and came
[12:11] forth and came from God neither came I
[12:13] of myself but he sent me
[12:17] amen now brother brand says here in in
[12:20] marriage and divorce he says and that's
[12:22] the way it is with God if I if a filial
[12:25] love which is human love Fellowship love
[12:27] can make a man feel that about his wife
[12:30] what about agape love the Greek word
[12:33] meaning the love of God how would that
[12:35] make me do about Jesus Christ all right
[12:38] that's how we should should love him in
[12:41] that love that he loves us and obviously
[12:44] he is love right and if the holy spirit
[12:47] is dwelling in you then what's got to
[12:49] project out of your life his love that's
[12:51] right not your love amen amen so the
[12:54] what love that he loves you with if the
[12:56] holy spirit is dwelling in you that's
[12:58] the love that project out that's right
[13:00] amen and that loves him back with amen
[13:03] amen and how would that make me do about
[13:06] Jesus Christ I as as long as I want to
[13:08] go do it it's in my heart to do it
[13:11] whether I say as long as it's in my
[13:12] heart to do it I go do it legalism won't
[13:14] let me do it it's because that I know
[13:16] I'd get punished for doing it but the
[13:18] real truth of it is is when the love of
[13:20] God comes into your heart till you want
[13:22] to do it yes amen not anybody pulling or
[13:26] pushing amen but it's because you want
[13:28] to to do it why cuz the love of God Amen
[13:31] is so much in
[13:32] you um do you want to do that's the
[13:35] truth of it there is the two schools not
[13:37] legalism or other amen or Calvinism it's
[13:40] both all right let's go down verse
[13:45] two praise the
[13:48] Lord should I move over here a little
[13:50] bit north the I don't know if that was
[13:52] capturing me or not you're almost in the
[13:54] frame
[13:59] all right verse two does anybody have
[14:01] any questions or any comments to this
[14:04] point this is Sunday school
[14:08] so praise the Lord amen thank you verse
[14:12] two it says by this we know that we love
[14:14] the children of God now this is an
[14:17] Evidence here by this we know that we
[14:19] love the children of God when we love
[14:22] God and keep his
[14:25] Commandments there it it is remember
[14:27] what Jesus was Jesus said in John 14:15
[14:30] if you love me keep my Commandments now
[14:33] that's just not the Ten Commandments
[14:35] that's right right but that's his word
[14:38] right in other if you can read that if
[14:40] you love me keep my word right amen
[14:43] that's the book from Genesis to
[14:45] Revelation that's right not just Ten
[14:47] Commandments because the Catholics they
[14:49] try to keep the Ten
[14:51] Commandments I know cuz I used to be a
[14:53] Catholic and we swear by those Ten
[14:55] Commandments and we would try to live by
[14:57] those Ten Commandments and we could
[14:59] couldn't even keep those Ten
[15:01] Commandments much less we could keep the
[15:03] rest of the
[15:05] Commandment right because why we are
[15:08] seeking uh a Catholic is seeking uh uh
[15:11] uh forgiveness and and and has to
[15:14] constantly uh ask forgiveness to the
[15:16] priest and confess and all these
[15:17] different things they have their hopes
[15:19] and and some and something else but amen
[15:22] the child of God has his hopes in Christ
[15:24] that's right has you laid your burdens
[15:26] down and you put your things on those
[15:28] things on
[15:29] Christ if you love me keep my
[15:32] Commandments that was one point that at
[15:34] one time that was that was fine when
[15:36] Jesus was saying that but then John as I
[15:38] said he goes takes it further by this we
[15:41] know that we love the children of God
[15:43] when we love God and keep his
[15:45] Commandments yes they all go hand in
[15:47] hand right you keep his Commandments you
[15:50] love God right you love God you love the
[15:53] Brethren amen and you will not do
[15:56] anything to the Brethren or to the
[15:58] sister sister that you would do if you
[16:01] knew that that was God standing amongst
[16:04] us would you gossip about your sister
[16:07] would you gossip about your brother if
[16:09] you knew that that was the actual Lord
[16:10] Jesus Christ standing there you would
[16:14] not oh but let me let me let me just
[16:17] like a like a lot of us I want you to
[16:19] pray for such and such why what was
[16:21] going on but let me tell
[16:24] you now when when somebody comes up to
[16:27] me and starts saying that you can you
[16:28] can as my wife and I'm not saying that
[16:30] I'm holier than that or nothing like
[16:31] that that's one thing that I've always
[16:34] despised is Gossip oh yeah I hate gossip
[16:37] I hate it with a passion and and and I I
[16:40] can see it from a mile away because it's
[16:43] something that that that it hurts it
[16:45] hurts your spirit when you know that you
[16:47] got involved in it that's right and if
[16:49] you know something about your brother
[16:52] and and the best thing that you can do
[16:55] is f first of all you pray for your
[16:57] brother pray for your sister yes and if
[16:59] you need to talk to some something
[17:01] somebody about it talk to your pastor
[17:04] all right but you don't have to spread
[17:06] around the church you don't have to
[17:08] because why amen that's what the
[17:10] scripture says love covers a multitude
[17:12] of sins amen
[17:15] amen pray for your brother pray for your
[17:17] sister and and let your pastor know you
[17:19] know because and then he let him decide
[17:22] what he wants to do amen praise God but
[17:25] uh we use that excuse sometimes and
[17:27] sometimes people come with us that
[17:29] excuse pray for such such person and
[17:32] it's it's opportunity for them to open
[17:33] up the gossip you know well you know
[17:36] what they did you know what they said at
[17:38] that moment what you should do is say
[17:40] well how was your fishing trip brother
[17:42] last week what it was fine good good how
[17:47] many fish did you catch it completely
[17:48] just tears tears that Spirit right there
[17:50] and there yes
[17:52] amen praise
[17:57] God in John 15 10 and we'll read a quote
[18:00] here just a moment if you keep my
[18:02] Commandments ye shall abide in my love
[18:04] Jesus said even as I have kept my
[18:07] father's Commandments and I abide in his
[18:10] love amen so this thing is about abiding
[18:12] I remember last time when I when I did
[18:14] Sunday school we talked about abiding in
[18:15] Christ amen this is part of abiding in
[18:19] him and him abiding in US amen again
[18:22] remember this love that we're talking
[18:24] about here in every scripture when you
[18:25] click on the Greek on the Greek Lexicon
[18:28] it's always agape love all right it's
[18:30] the love of God this whole thing is
[18:31] about the love of God but Bram says in
[18:35] love you let your wife know that you
[18:37] love
[18:37] her do you
[18:40] Brothers I know I can do it
[18:43] more but she knows that I love
[18:46] her but we should always that they they
[18:49] want to know that amen it's a
[18:52] reiteration they want to know that she
[18:55] loves you it'll when you're when you're
[18:57] a young couple and find favor with one
[18:59] another it makes you join yourselves
[19:01] together for a lifetime
[19:03] Journey love and that's a filial love
[19:06] that's human love what will a Godly love
[19:08] do when you can really get into a place
[19:10] that you can show God that you love him
[19:13] and you got confidence in
[19:16] him
[19:18] so it's like all right me me and
[19:22] Christine Christine and me we we decided
[19:25] to get married and we I love her but yet
[19:28] I
[19:29] I'm constantly at work and I'm calling
[19:31] her what are you doing at the grocery
[19:33] store what are you buying now well how
[19:36] much are you charging on the in are are
[19:39] you are you changing Zoe's
[19:41] diaper what if I was constantly doing
[19:44] that to her right that would mean that I
[19:46] am not showing any sort of confidence in
[19:49] her and that is not that's not showing
[19:52] her true love and so love amen love and
[19:56] confidence goes hand in hand because why
[19:58] when you have when you love God you've
[20:00] given your life over to him completely
[20:02] and you say Lord I have confidence in
[20:04] you I have confidence totally in your
[20:07] word everything that it says whether I
[20:09] understand it or not I completely
[20:11] confide in your word because why I know
[20:14] that you cannot lie amen that's that's
[20:16] that's that's a aspect of love amen
[20:19] agapy
[20:21] love how you'll join yourself to him not
[20:24] only for a life's journey but for
[20:26] eternity how you're willing to take his
[20:27] word just at what he says and say that's
[20:31] right Lord I question it not and you
[20:33] move right on amen that's that's what
[20:36] takes real love praise
[20:40] God first John 5:3 says how much time we
[20:45] got 15 15 15 minutes
[20:49] okay verse three says for this is the
[20:52] love of God that we keep his
[20:55] Commandments and his Commandments are
[20:57] not Grievous or great g g
[21:00] Grievous now that word Grievous amen it
[21:04] means not weighty grave or burdensome or
[21:07] heavy in other words to a true child of
[21:11] God obeying his word and staying with
[21:13] his word is not something that's
[21:15] burdensome to him or her right that's
[21:17] right it's not a burden amen for you to
[21:19] come to church it's not a burden for you
[21:21] to pray it's not a burden for you to
[21:25] have to come to your brother to shake
[21:27] his or sister to shake his or her hand
[21:31] why because why that's reflecting the
[21:33] love amen of God in you amen it's not a
[21:36] burden amen uh uh uh to obey God's word
[21:39] amen why because God's love is is is is
[21:43] is in you amen it's reflecting out amen
[21:45] it's it's it's it's it's showing forth
[21:47] amen it's all in you and then it wants
[21:49] to come out of you amen so that others
[21:52] can benefit from it that's right I think
[21:55] I I said last time you know God gives us
[21:58] gifts M and it's just like a tree right
[22:02] a tree Bears forth fruit and God has
[22:05] given each and every one of us some sort
[22:06] of gift sister Trudy every time I I I I
[22:11] I go I I go I go you know she's around
[22:14] me she's she's very very
[22:17] kind I mean she's very very kind sister
[22:21] that's right she is you know and a lot
[22:23] of you all are that way you know and and
[22:27] and there's a certain gift that you all
[22:29] have that draws people to you you know
[22:32] and so when you have the when you God
[22:34] has given us these gifts and it's like a
[22:36] tree an apple tree those apples that are
[22:38] coming forth from that tree they're not
[22:40] for the tree to enjoy right they're for
[22:42] us to enjoy right and those gifts that
[22:46] you and I possess amen they're not for
[22:48] our own benefit but they're for the
[22:50] benefit of other people yes right the
[22:53] gift that brother brandham had it wasn't
[22:54] for him it was for for the people to to
[22:57] benefit that gift amen and so therefore
[23:02] we have to we have to be careful how we
[23:04] use those gifts how we how we how we
[23:07] manifest those gifts amen because
[23:09] remember it's God Amen that it's it's
[23:11] not your gift it's God's Gift
[23:14] amen so obeying God's word is not it's
[23:17] not and keeping his word is not Grievous
[23:19] it's not it's not weighty it's not
[23:21] burdensome and Jesus uh mentioned this
[23:24] in in Matthew 11 says come unto me all
[23:27] ye that labor in our heavy lat and I
[23:29] will give you rest there's no better
[23:31] rest than in Christ amen take my yoke
[23:34] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[23:36] and lowly in heart and ye shall find
[23:38] rest unto your souls listen for my yoke
[23:41] is easy and my burden is light in other
[23:45] words my word is easy and my word is
[23:48] light the Christian Life is only as hard
[23:51] as you make it right amen you're the one
[23:55] who decid how difficult the Christian
[23:57] Life is because it really is isn't all
[23:59] he wants us to to the only burden that
[24:01] he wants us to have is his word and and
[24:04] and and and if you're in love with God
[24:05] it's not a burden to have his word amen
[24:08] on you you
[24:09] know you know to have anything that has
[24:12] to do with his word that shouldn't be a
[24:14] burden right no a lot of people make the
[24:17] Christian Life oh it's a it's tough it's
[24:20] difficult it's a bunch of rules but it
[24:21] really isn't because Jesus expressed it
[24:25] right here he said for my yoke is easy
[24:27] and my burden is life oh yeah so just
[24:29] put every other burden put it on him
[24:32] just take his word that's the only
[24:34] burden he wants us to have and really
[24:35] it's not a burden once you're once
[24:37] you're in love with Christ that's right
[24:39] am amen amen praise
[24:42] God now I want just I want us to read
[24:44] this here in John I know it's lengthy
[24:46] reading but uh I want us to read here
[24:49] because I like what Jesus said here in
[24:50] John 15 he says here and is my father
[24:52] glorify that you bear much fruit so
[24:55] shall you be my disciples and the father
[24:58] hath loved me so have I loved you
[25:01] continue ye in my love so he tells us
[25:05] continue ye in my Commandments but he
[25:07] also says continue ye in my love which
[25:10] remember the love keeping his word it's
[25:13] all it's all in all all it's it's whole
[25:16] it's the same thing
[25:17] amen if you keep my Commandments ye
[25:20] shall abide in my love right amen even
[25:23] as I have kept my father's Commandments
[25:25] and abide in his love these things have
[25:27] I spoken unto you that my joy might
[25:29] remain in you and that your joy might be
[25:31] full this is my commandment that you
[25:35] this is not anybody else's commandment
[25:36] this is my commandment this is Jesus
[25:39] speaking that you love one another as I
[25:42] have loved you so let's look and see how
[25:44] Jesus loved his disciples how he loved
[25:46] the people how he loved and let's love
[25:48] in that same way amen greater
[25:52] love hath no man than this that a man
[25:54] lay down his life for his friends
[25:59] jumping taking the bullet for your
[26:01] brother
[26:03] amen ye are my friends if you do
[26:06] whatsoever I command
[26:08] you these things I command you that you
[26:11] love one another it's a commandment
[26:15] amen if the world hate you you know that
[26:19] I It hated me before it hated you that's
[26:22] why he's a high priest that can be
[26:24] touched by the feeling of our
[26:25] infirmities because he went through it
[26:27] first amen
[26:29] if he were of the world the world would
[26:31] love his own now that's the word love
[26:34] right
[26:35] there
[26:37] uh when you look when you look at the
[26:41] that word love right there that's the
[26:42] filal love right there look look at the
[26:45] definition of that love there and that
[26:46] goes back to filio see the the world
[26:49] only loves you for what you have that's
[26:52] right the world only loves you for what
[26:54] you can for what they can get out of you
[26:57] or what you you can give them
[27:00] amen but it has nothing to do with God
[27:03] agape love love his own but because you
[27:06] are not of the
[27:07] world but I have chosen you out of the
[27:10] world therefore the world hateth
[27:12] you
[27:14] so you know when I came in when I came
[27:17] to Christ there was a lot of things I
[27:19] had a lot of worldly friends and I I do
[27:21] a lot of you know things with them and
[27:23] it came a point in time when when I came
[27:25] to Christ and my life started changing
[27:27] and and things started taking place and
[27:30] I didn't have to do one thing to get
[27:32] them to stop hanging out with me they
[27:35] just automatically started going
[27:37] away there's not one thing that I had to
[27:40] do I didn't have to tell them don't call
[27:41] me anymore don't do anything to why cuz
[27:43] they saw that you were not going with
[27:45] their program anymore and they started
[27:47] automa we we can't get nothing out of
[27:49] this guy
[27:50] anymore so that's what the world's going
[27:53] to do amen that's a sign that God's
[27:55] doing a work in your life amen first
[27:58] John ver 5 verse4 oh my for whatsoever

[28:48] tribulation but be of good cheer I have
[28:51] overcome the world I love that scripture

[31:03] just skip some of this cuz we're sort of

[31:07] says who is he that overcometh the world
[31:10] but he that believeth that Jesus is the
[31:12] son of God and first John 4:15 tells us
[31:15] whosoever shall confess that Jesus is
[31:17] the son of God God dwelleth in him and
[31:19] he in God again John finishes here with
[31:22] verse 5 going back to verse one and
[31:25] telling us who is he that overcometh the
[31:28] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[31:29] is the son of
