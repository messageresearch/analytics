[1:16] it says Ephesians Paul and Ephesians and
[1:19] uh
[1:20] let's go ahead and um
[1:23] turn to Matthew
[1:26] chapter 13.
[1:31] this brother Dale talking about all the
[1:33] the healings and the Miracles
[1:35] we just seen God move so much lately and
[1:39] uh you know last Sunday Zach was uh he
[1:42] was laying in the car between the
[1:43] services and uh just he was like Daddy I
[1:46] just want to go home and and um
[1:50] you know sometimes the devil will do
[1:52] stuff like that to you to let's let's
[1:54] let's go on and forsake This sinling
[1:56] Together of ourselves and and uh but you
[1:59] know I I lay my hands on him and prayed
[2:01] for him a little bit he come on in the
[2:02] church and he felt a little bit better
[2:04] and then after the service he uh he came
[2:06] up and brother Dale prayed for him and
[2:08] he said after the afternoon that
[2:10] afternoon he said I I feel I'm
[2:13] completely delivered that uh God just
[2:16] raised him up and
[2:19] okay
[2:20] God is able God is in our midst he's
[2:23] still the same yesterday today and
[2:25] forever so uh this morning I um
[2:29] you know uh I before I start talking I
[2:32] just you know sometimes the devil will
[2:34] come and talk to you before you minister
[2:36] or whatever and and uh you know I just
[2:38] want to free myself up a little bit
[2:40] he'll say you know you can't you you
[2:42] know uh you you can't bring anything new
[2:46] or something to this church or whatever
[2:48] and that's not my intent because what I
[2:50] don't want to bring anything new or
[2:51] anything anything new that you hadn't
[2:53] heard anymore it's the same old gospel
[2:56] the same old message and you know if if
[2:58] I just go for 30 minutes or or until 12
[3:01] o'clock you know let's just uh just uh
[3:04] just give me liberty to just relax a
[3:07] little bit and and uh you know if it's
[3:09] not as long maybe as you think it should
[3:11] be then uh praise the Lord anyhow so
[3:17] um I just want to relax myself a little
[3:20] bit so that the Lord can move maybe and
[3:23] uh now let's just read in Matthew
[3:25] chapter 13.
[3:28] uh verse 3
[3:31] and then we'll skip on down to verse 24
[3:33] and 25 and then go over to First Kings
[3:35] chapter 17 Matthew 13 verse 3.
[3:40] and he spoke many parables unto them in
[3:44] Parables many things unto them in
[3:45] Parable saying behold A sower went forth
[3:49] to sow
[3:50] and over in in the 24th verse another
[3:54] Parable put him forth unto them saying
[3:57] the Kingdom of Heaven is likened into a
[3:59] man which sowed good seed in his field
[4:02] but while men slept his enemy came and
[4:05] sowed tears among the wheat and went his
[4:08] way and now let's go over to
[4:11] First Kings chapter 17.
[4:15] um
[4:22] verse 22
[4:25] and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah
[4:27] and the soul of the child came into him
[4:29] again and he revived let's bow our heads
[4:32] Lord Jesus we thank you God for your
[4:33] grace to us and for your presence here
[4:36] Among Us this morning Lord and we thank
[4:38] you Lord God for making yourself a
[4:40] manifest in our midst Lord Jesus and
[4:42] Lord God as we open your word this
[4:44] morning Lord I pray Lord that you will
[4:46] open it to our hearts Lord Jesus and
[4:48] minister to us Lord if anyone's come
[4:50] this morning Lord Jesus are seeking a
[4:52] touch from you Lord I pray that they'll
[4:54] be touched Lord just like the woman Lord
[4:58] that had a an issue in her Lord Jesus
[5:00] that desire that touched from you Lord
[5:02] Jesus I pray God that maybe Lord
[5:04] something will be said this morning to
[5:06] help and not to hinder Lord God and Lord
[5:08] you just have the preeminence this
[5:10] morning Lord we ask it in your name that
[5:12] shall be among us Lord bless the reading
[5:15] of your word in the name of the Lord
[5:16] Jesus Christ you may be seated
[5:19] now keep in mind these two scriptures
[5:23] that a civil war went forth to sow
[5:29] down a little bit
[5:33] okay
[5:34] just alert me if you can't hear me right
[5:37] place I need water
[5:40] A sower went forth to sow
[5:44] and over in First Kings chapter 17 verse
[5:48] 22
[5:49] and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah
[5:51] and the soul of the child came into him
[5:53] again and he revived and I I want to
[5:58] speak this morning on maybe a strange
[6:00] topic because
[6:03] um
[6:03] you know one this this topic came to me
[6:07] one day when I was walking to work when
[6:10] going to work one morning and I was uh
[6:12] when I sit on the bus or or ride the the
[6:16] subway I'll sit there and just listen to
[6:19] the look to Elijah in in my earpiece and
[6:22] I or I'll read the Bible on the train
[6:24] and and that's just a nice little hour
[6:26] of meditation where that I can spend
[6:29] studying on the the Lord and thinking on
[6:31] meditating on the word and
[6:34] um you know sometimes when I get off the
[6:36] train um you know I walk into the office
[6:40] and I have maybe a five minute or ten
[6:42] minute walk
[6:43] and then uh the the the word has been
[6:48] sown and then the spirit will just come
[6:51] down and Quicken it so you know not
[6:53] every time but but sometimes it doesn't
[6:55] and um I I'm not saying this to make
[6:59] nothing of myself you know that but um
[7:02] I'm just saying this as a uh as an
[7:06] illustration that um this is uh
[7:10] foreign
[7:11] one morning I was walking in uh into
[7:15] work after I had been listening to the
[7:17] Lord and
[7:18] just the spirit of the Lord fell in such
[7:21] a way that uh you know maybe it just
[7:25] kind of maybe more rare than it should
[7:27] be and uh something happened that I'll
[7:30] leave toward the end of this message to
[7:32] share it with you but uh you know just
[7:35] the power of God came down in such a way
[7:37] and it just began to reveal his word and
[7:40] because first the word must be sown into
[7:44] your heart and then that makes a way for
[7:47] the spirit to come and make bring it to
[7:49] life and make it manifest and I I got to
[7:52] thinking
[7:53] what makes what constitutes a Revival
[7:57] and you know many times we'll look and
[8:00] we'll we'll uh maybe get the wrong idea
[8:03] in our head we'll think maybe if the
[8:06] musicians have just uh uh forgive me but
[8:09] get their act together a way to say
[8:11] maybe if they would just play a little
[8:13] more pumped up music or something or or
[8:16] do something a little bit different or
[8:17] maybe if the preach sure would swear a
[8:19] little bit more or maybe uh if he would
[8:22] um
[8:23] uh just
[8:26] all these things in our mind we have our
[8:29] own mental conception of how it should
[8:30] work and how it should be laid out for a
[8:33] Revival to come and I I was thinking
[8:35] years ago I was in a I was in a um a
[8:39] church service and this church service
[8:42] you know sometimes you you you come to
[8:45] church and maybe you think this was at
[8:47] another church now I just want to point
[8:49] that out but
[8:53] uh the um the the the preacher was
[8:57] preaching on something you think well
[8:59] we've heard this so many times before
[9:01] and you look across the congregation and
[9:04] there was people on the front row asleep
[9:06] and everybody was so tired and and
[9:09] everybody it seemed like everybody had
[9:11] heard that before and you think well you
[9:13] know how can how can a Revival come from
[9:16] this and it at the end of the service a
[9:19] little young person sprung up in this
[9:21] tears streaming down their face and they
[9:23] went up to the Altar and gave their
[9:25] heart to the Lord and fell down at the
[9:27] altar you think you you we picked you in
[9:30] our mind what a Revival is that a
[9:32] Revival has got to be something that'll
[9:34] pump you up and and uh and just you know
[9:38] all the musicians excited everybody's
[9:41] excited people standing up during the
[9:43] whole service but let's find out what a
[9:47] Revival really is and and now keep these
[9:51] two scripts a lot of times when the
[9:52] minister to read the scriptures that you
[9:55] forget the scriptures halfway through
[9:56] this I don't want you to forget the
[9:58] scriptures this morning that Matthew 13
[10:00] 13 3.
[10:02] A sower went forth to sow and First
[10:05] Kings chapter 17 verse 22 and you know
[10:09] and this day I I was looking around
[10:12] I think it worked a lot a lot of times I
[10:14] read this article about how
[10:16] people HD
[10:18] it was kind of it was supposed to be a
[10:20] motivational thing about how you in this
[10:23] day and time a lot of people the CEO and
[10:26] the CTO and everybody at work they um
[10:31] they're Faking It is what this article
[10:33] was saying is they don't really know
[10:35] what they're doing and I you know if You
[10:37] observe at work I get in these little
[10:40] conference rooms and and and you can see
[10:43] people come in with their presentations
[10:44] and whatnot what should we buy this
[10:46] software or should we buy that and the
[10:49] people making the decisions really don't
[10:51] know they're faking it they're just
[10:54] trying to they're trying to put on
[10:56] something that like they know what's
[10:59] going on but really they're faking it
[11:01] and you know we were faking it until God
[11:04] sent us Elijah to show us the truth to
[11:07] show us the real the real message and
[11:10] now I want to take a look at First Kings
[11:12] chapter 17 because
[11:16] you know before a revival can come you
[11:21] know brother Dale's been preaching on uh
[11:24] how God predestinates by our desire
[11:28] not his desire
[11:30] and you know Matthew Henry says
[11:33] something real real interesting he I
[11:35] wrote it down in my little scratchy
[11:37] right unless Lord will not be able to
[11:38] read it when God intends great Mercy for
[11:41] his people
[11:42] the first thing he does is set them a
[11:46] Praying because they desire to see
[11:49] something they have a desire in their
[11:51] heart in their life for something to
[11:54] happen now some people pray for God to
[11:58] make a move in their Church make a move
[12:01] for an individual but uh you know this
[12:05] person particular person in First Kings
[12:07] chapter 17 that we're going to look at
[12:08] prayed for something in herself and you
[12:12] know um
[12:14] ah
[12:15] and this first Kings chapter 17 just
[12:19] Elijah comes on the scene all of a
[12:21] sudden and maybe the the place and the
[12:24] time that he appeared mirrors maybe a
[12:27] little bit the the place and the time of
[12:29] today because Israel was a lot like
[12:31] America that they had found it they they
[12:34] supposedly had founded uh not supposedly
[12:37] they had they they had founded uh
[12:41] the whole nation was founded on God on
[12:44] on the on on today we would say on on
[12:47] our Christian principles and they had
[12:49] left those Christian principles behind
[12:51] and Ahab had set himself an example for
[12:55] all the other people in the nation as
[12:56] the head of the state the head of the
[12:58] church and whatnot he had married
[13:01] himself to that Jezebel religion and all
[13:04] of the priests began to follow him and
[13:06] and uh instead of staying with the with
[13:10] the written word with God's word they
[13:12] went off into that uh idolatry
[13:15] adulterous system and they forsue God's
[13:20] word and I
[13:22] I want to impress upon you today that no
[13:25] matter you know I see a lot of times the
[13:28] preacher from behind the pulpit will say
[13:30] something about marriage and divorce or
[13:32] whatever and then you go home and your
[13:34] mom and daddy will say something
[13:36] contrary it'll be all right if you kiss
[13:38] somebody it'll be all right if you Court
[13:40] it'll be all right but God's word is the
[13:43] standard that we live by I don't care
[13:44] who it is it says it if it's contrary to
[13:47] God's word I don't say I don't care
[13:49] whether even if I say something contrary
[13:52] because Paul said if an angel from
[13:54] heaven brings says anything contrary to
[13:57] by my word don't don't don't listen to
[13:59] him but God's word is the standard the
[14:02] measurement that we live by and they
[14:06] they went aside from God's standard they
[14:10] took uh they took Satan's lives just
[14:13] like in the Garden of Eden a little bit
[14:15] of doubt in there
[14:17] mixed in and and that produced a hybrid
[14:21] nation and and look at this this scene
[14:24] where uh you know brother Branham
[14:26] explained that people were as this
[14:28] little widow woman was crying out to God
[14:31] people were walking down the streets
[14:33] with their wine casts and their just in
[14:37] complete chaos and they uh
[14:40] the uh the the same kind of situation
[14:43] that we have today maybe not maybe don't
[14:46] look at it so much in America but what
[14:48] about the message where the thing the
[14:52] people that should be the most holy the
[14:54] most Sanctified for God are leaving the
[14:57] word or leaving the true word or the
[14:59] hour
[15:00] and and and
[15:02] maybe her heart in that day cried out
[15:05] for a Revival that something where when
[15:08] everybody else it looked like had left
[15:10] the true word but she had something in
[15:13] her heart crying out and the word of the
[15:16] Lord came unto him saying get thee hints
[15:18] and turn the Eastward and hide thyself
[15:20] by the Brookshire wrist that is before
[15:23] Jordan
[15:24] let me skip on down the word of the Lord
[15:26] came unto him saying arise get thee to
[15:27] Zarephath which belongeth to zidon and
[15:30] dwell there behold I have commanded a
[15:32] widow woman there to sustain thee so he
[15:36] arose and went to Zarephath now what it
[15:39] doesn't say in the Bible and what
[15:41] brother Branham illuminates because the
[15:43] prophet can tear open the word like that
[15:45] great eagle and reveal the Hidden
[15:47] Mysteries as he pointed out that while
[15:50] God spoke to Elijah he also spoke to the
[15:54] widow woman and told her to go out and
[15:57] pick up two little sticks and bring them
[15:59] together because her now that's
[16:02] predestination God moving things in line
[16:05] and moving things into order so so that
[16:08] you could hear the word and so that your
[16:10] desire could be made and manifest
[16:12] because she desired to hear the word she
[16:15] desired maybe she didn't even know what
[16:18] she was really Desiring but something
[16:20] just inside her was was crying out as a
[16:23] heart pan for the water Brook and I I
[16:26] was thinking back to
[16:28] um
[16:29] when
[16:31] when we
[16:33] right after my wife and I got married I
[16:36] I spent uh you know I didn't even know
[16:38] what I was searching for and I had a
[16:41] little brother uh tell me you need to
[16:43] find a church and I I laid on my knees
[16:46] and on my face for two weeks and I you
[16:49] know something something so strong and
[16:52] so great was laid on my heart that I
[16:54] needed to move from where I was in South
[16:55] Carolina and uh I I called out to God I
[17:00] don't know where to go I don't know what
[17:01] to do and uh you know there was a little
[17:05] person that said well there's you can
[17:06] come to our church and I think uh maybe
[17:10] uh and you know I didn't even really
[17:13] know what I was after and but you know
[17:18] God is so great to give us the desires
[17:21] of our heart just like you know the same
[17:24] thing happened to Cornelius in the Bible
[17:26] where he he he fell down and fasted and
[17:30] prayed for hours that God would send him
[17:32] the word that God would send him
[17:34] send him somebody that knew what they
[17:37] were talking about and and he sent him
[17:39] straight to Peter and Before Peter got
[17:43] there God showed Peter that he was
[17:45] coming by vision and just like this
[17:48] little woman and uh this little widow
[17:51] woman that God put the ends together he
[17:53] put everything together and uh just God
[17:56] works it out so marvelously
[17:59] uh so
[18:02] he arose and went to Zarephath and when
[18:04] he came to the gate of the city behold
[18:06] the widow woman was there Gathering of
[18:08] sticks and he called her and said fetch
[18:10] me I pray thee a little water and a
[18:11] vessel that I may drink
[18:14] and you know that's a theme that's
[18:15] repeated often often in the Bible over
[18:19] and over is before you get something
[18:21] from God you've got to give something
[18:23] Isaac and Rebecca before when when the
[18:27] messenger came to Rebecca the sign was
[18:29] that she would volunteer to go water his
[18:32] camels
[18:33] she volunteered to do it I'll I'll go
[18:36] above and beyond more than what whatever
[18:38] it takes whatever it takes Lord I'll do
[18:41] it
[18:42] and and so This Woman This with a woman
[18:45] and she said as the Lord thy God liveth
[18:48] I am not a cake but a handful of meal in
[18:50] a barrel he told her bring me I pray the
[18:51] immersive bread in thine hand and she
[18:53] said I had I have not a cake but a
[18:55] handful of meal and a barrel and a
[18:57] little oil in a cruise and behold I am
[18:58] Gathering two sticks that I may go in
[19:00] and dress it for me and my son that we
[19:03] may eat it and die so she took those two
[19:06] little sticks to cross
[19:08] um
[19:10] she took the two little sticks to cross
[19:12] and she took the word
[19:14] and she quickened it with the spirit
[19:16] just like on my way from the subway the
[19:21] word had been sown and the Spirit came
[19:23] and quickened it and after the spirit
[19:26] comes and quickens that word then you
[19:28] got something you can hang on to
[19:31] you got something that can't be shaken
[19:34] and you know that that word had to be
[19:38] crushed without by that pestle because
[19:40] he was wounded for our transgressions
[19:42] bruised for our iniquities
[19:45] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[19:48] him by his stripes we are healed and you
[19:51] can rest upon that if you need healing
[19:53] if you need salvation if you need
[19:54] anything you can rest upon God's word
[19:57] being just hang on that now and Elijah
[20:01] said under a fear not go and do as our
[20:03] sin but make me thereof a little cake
[20:05] first and bring it unto me and after
[20:08] make for thee and for thy sin for thus
[20:10] saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel
[20:12] of meal shall not waste neither shall
[20:15] the crews of oil fail until the day that
[20:18] the Lord sendeth rain upon the Earth and
[20:20] she went and did according to the saying
[20:22] of Elijah and she and he and her house
[20:25] did he many days
[20:27] because after the Revival comes it
[20:31] doesn't last right right just until the
[20:33] next day or just until the next week but
[20:36] it's something permanent it's something
[20:38] that that never ends it never fails a
[20:41] Revival is for a real revivalist forever
[20:45] and ever for Eternal and she went and
[20:48] did according to the sayings of Elijah
[20:50] and the barrel of middleweights did not
[20:51] and and then now the scripture that I'm
[20:54] getting to
[20:55] and it came to pass after these things
[20:58] that the son of the woman the Mistress
[21:01] of the house
[21:02] fell sick and his sickness was so sore
[21:05] that there was no breath left in him
[21:08] and that's how God a lot of times after
[21:11] after He blesses you after he fills you
[21:14] with the Holy Ghost after the River
[21:17] Jordan then comes the trial then God's
[21:20] going to see What You're Made Of what's
[21:22] in there and
[21:24] and that's what he was doing to the
[21:26] little widow woman to see what's see
[21:28] what's going to happen and she said unto
[21:31] Elijah what have I had to do with the
[21:32] old thou man of God all Thou come unto
[21:35] me to call my sin to remembrance and to
[21:37] slay my son I remember somebody came up
[21:40] to what I was afraid when they came
[21:42] before The Prophet all of my sins are
[21:45] going to be remembered all the things
[21:47] that I've done but he said I can't once
[21:50] it's under the blood I can't see it no
[21:51] more it's gone I can't see it and he
[21:54] said unto her give me thy son there it
[21:57] is again before you can get you've got
[22:00] to give you've got to you know before uh
[22:05] Moses mother got him back she had to put
[22:08] him in that bull rush and let that
[22:10] little that little basket and let him go
[22:12] and send him on give him over to God and
[22:15] then she got something back greater than
[22:17] she could probably ever have imagined
[22:19] she she probably thought something
[22:22] special is about this son but my
[22:25] goodness what he turned out to be
[22:27] because she gave him up
[22:29] give me thy sin and he took him out of
[22:31] her bosom and carried him up into a loft
[22:34] where he Abode and laid him upon his own
[22:37] bed
[22:38] and he cried unto the Lord and said oh
[22:41] Lord my God hast thou also brought evil
[22:43] upon the Widow with whom I sojourned by
[22:45] slaying her son
[22:47] and he stretched himself upon the child
[22:49] three times
[22:51] and Cried unto the Lord and he said oh
[22:53] Lord my God I pray thee let this child's
[22:56] Soul come into him again and the Lord
[22:58] heard the voice of Elijah and the soul
[23:01] of the child came into him again amen
[23:04] and he revised
[23:07] now think about that when you're home
[23:10] and you put the tape in the tape player
[23:12] and you press play
[23:14] that voice of Elijah comes into your
[23:16] heart and it quickens something
[23:19] you know I don't believe in just a a one
[23:23] full ministry where you just listen to
[23:25] the prophet you know like a lot of
[23:27] people I was talking to another brother
[23:29] recently about that and that that
[23:30] blessed me like some people believe in a
[23:32] one-fold and some people believe in the
[23:35] fourfold but I believe in a five-fold
[23:38] Ministry where you get pulled Along by
[23:40] the ministers and you listen to the
[23:42] prophet at home
[23:44] have a complete the complete uh little
[23:48] little set and uh
[23:50] now so let's talk about down through
[23:54] history God has has revealed himself to
[23:57] his people and through the desire of the
[24:00] people for something has ministered
[24:02] himself and you know in the 1800s uh
[24:06] there was a man a ugly man named that
[24:09] they they said the ugliest man around
[24:11] James McCready
[24:13] around the 1800s and they said he was so
[24:16] ugly that surely he would have something
[24:18] good to say because he sure wasn't
[24:20] nothing good to look at and you know a
[24:23] lot of times I think how that's how
[24:25] maybe the gospel is sometimes maybe
[24:28] I I've got such a great blessing by
[24:31] looking at the people that brought the
[24:33] gospel down Through the Ages men that
[24:35] couldn't hardly get a word out like
[24:37] Smith Wigglesworth a plumber that would
[24:39] couldn't hardly get their uh thoughts
[24:41] together and uh ugly men that you think
[24:44] my goodness what good can come out of
[24:46] such an ugly face and and uh people that
[24:50] uh you think a Revival has got to be
[24:52] something that just just uh all polished
[24:55] up and and just everything just slicked
[24:58] up and right but you know a lot of times
[25:00] the devil's more than that and I I'm
[25:03] just speaking playing this morning
[25:10] now the James McCready lived around the
[25:14] time of of the the Cane Ridge Revival
[25:16] and Kane Ridge got his name for all the
[25:18] young fellas that was a man named Daniel
[25:20] Boone that one day was walking by this
[25:23] Ridge where Kane was growing and he gave
[25:24] it his name Cain region that over time
[25:27] they started a church there and then as
[25:30] time went on they uh man began to call
[25:34] upon the Lord and have a desire for God
[25:36] God's word to be made manifest in their
[25:39] midst and
[25:42] the Presbyterian Church actually started
[25:45] this they said we're gonna they sent out
[25:47] flyers and they said we're going to have
[25:48] this great move of God and and they told
[25:51] everybody it's going to be the greatest
[25:53] Revival that you've ever seen it's going
[25:55] to be amazing and people from thousands
[25:58] came from all around and they they
[26:01] gathered to hear the word of God brought
[26:03] and when they gathered there were so
[26:06] many people that they had sometimes
[26:08] seven preachers preaching at once
[26:09] there'd be some over here and some over
[26:11] there and just all going at once and Men
[26:16] the god began his Spirit began to make
[26:18] manifest among the people and you know
[26:21] what happened the Presbyterian Church
[26:23] disowned them they said uh we don't want
[26:26] that we wash our hands of this business
[26:29] we don't we're ashamed of the fire
[26:32] falling of the of God's move amongst the
[26:35] people
[26:35] and you know this what happened after
[26:39] this revival was the people they started
[26:42] up there was I was reading through the
[26:44] list of denominations that started as a
[26:47] result of this revival instead of of
[26:50] bringing the people in one Accord and
[26:52] and and God uh manifesting his word to
[26:56] individuals it what it did was it
[26:58] segmented them off and so that they
[27:01] could they they took their own ideas and
[27:03] took their own interpretation and
[27:05] created a little uh little pockets I
[27:08] believe a little different little
[27:09] denominations and I noticed one of the
[27:11] things they did was after the Revival
[27:13] and you can go there today is they built
[27:16] a little Monument a little building and
[27:20] uh you know a little historical symbol
[27:23] that you could go back to and say here
[27:26] is where the fire fell here is where it
[27:29] was and and I think maybe a lot of times
[27:32] people in the message maybe are looking
[27:33] for monuments you know brother Brandon
[27:36] when he was preaching on the the future
[27:38] home they people misinterpreted and
[27:41] thought that he was saying that you got
[27:43] to be within a certain circumference of
[27:45] the Tabernacle that you got to go to the
[27:47] Tabernacle and go to that particular
[27:49] place and as you talk to people through
[27:52] the message
[27:54] I've I've found many times that people
[27:57] will say if unless you go to this
[28:00] particular Church unless you go to this
[28:03] particular place because that church
[28:05] becomes a monument a monument of a
[28:08] historical event something that took
[28:10] place back then
[28:12] but God is not a God just of history but
[28:14] he's a god of the present he's a god
[28:17] he's still the same yesterday today and
[28:20] forever not just yesterday
[28:21] and then moving on up as you can see as
[28:26] God poured out his Spirit then people
[28:29] would take their own ideas and pull away
[28:31] and then God would pour out his Spirit
[28:33] again John Smith in the 1850s he's the
[28:36] one that would pray until he couldn't
[28:38] even see it The Breakfast Table he'd
[28:40] have to get his wife to bring him his
[28:41] food and he labored before the people I
[28:44] was reading about this uh brother uh
[28:46] this other brother that would he
[28:48] ministered to the Indians and would pry
[28:51] cry and pray until his eye his nose
[28:53] would bleed and just the great desire
[28:56] for God's God to move among the people
[28:58] and then as he as God would move then
[29:02] that the people would would pull away
[29:04] instead of being receiving a fervor to
[29:07] serve God they'd pull away in their own
[29:09] ideas and their own their own knowledge
[29:12] in their own way of thinking
[29:14] and
[29:17] then the Welsh Revival in 1904 to 1905
[29:21] and this was a great blessing to me to
[29:24] just read about this and study about it
[29:26] because you know what happened was
[29:29] there's this little fella named Evan
[29:30] Roberts and many people don't really
[29:32] know why exactly how it started but Evan
[29:35] Roberts was one of the most influential
[29:37] you know he he preached more maybe than
[29:40] a lot of the other ministers in the
[29:41] Welsh Revival and I was reading where
[29:44] he's he was going to a little uh he was
[29:47] going to a seminary and one day he came
[29:49] up to his professor and said I've been
[29:51] the Lord is just leading me
[29:53] to go back to my church
[29:56] and to preach to the young people and he
[29:58] said well if that's what the Lord is
[30:00] doing he was a wise man except that if
[30:02] that's what the Lord is leading you to
[30:04] do then go back and and preach to him so
[30:07] he went back and
[30:08] you know the the the minister didn't
[30:12] really
[30:13] he hadn't quite proven little Evan
[30:16] Roberts and he said well Evan Roberts
[30:19] said I want to preach and he said well
[30:21] you can I tell you what you can preach
[30:23] uh we're gonna have a church service and
[30:26] at the end of it if you want to you can
[30:28] get up and say a few words and so
[30:32] the church service came and Evan Roberts
[30:35] got up to speak and pretty much
[30:37] everybody left except for 17 people
[30:40] and you remember in Sunday school we
[30:42] were looking at the number 17 and there
[30:45] was just 17 people left
[30:47] and Evan Roberts he didn't he wasn't a
[30:50] very eloquent man he was another person
[30:52] that followed in the lines of James
[30:53] McCready and the other ones that you
[30:56] didn't fit the what you would think of
[30:59] somebody that could that could pull on
[31:01] people and cause them to surrender their
[31:04] lives but he just he reached in his
[31:06] pocket and he pulled out a little sheet
[31:08] of paper and he said he stood before
[31:10] those 17 young people and he said I have
[31:12] a message for you from the Lord
[31:15] and he read these four points that I
[31:18] will read for you now
[31:20] all sin must be confessed to God and
[31:24] repentative
[31:26] number two
[31:28] there must be no cloud between the
[31:30] believer and God
[31:33] forgive everyone
[31:35] now these are all biblical biblically
[31:37] based he didn't just make these up you
[31:39] know
[31:40] and these are these are good points you
[31:43] know a lot of times brother Brian right
[31:45] before he preached the Seven Seals he
[31:47] preached Christ revealed in Simplicity
[31:49] because God is so great that he can get
[31:52] himself down to where we just it just
[31:54] bothers our mind how simple he can be
[31:56] how simple the truth can be and just a
[32:00] simple simple little message sometimes
[32:02] will uh
[32:05] we'll just expose our little problems
[32:08] and and you know all sin must be
[32:11] confessed to God and repentative all of
[32:15] it yes all of it ever ever last one
[32:17] there must be no cloud between the
[32:20] believer in God forgive everyone let
[32:23] nothing between and we've got nothing
[32:25] between you and God you can come boldly
[32:28] before his throne of mercy and ask ask
[32:30] for Grace ask for the petition that you
[32:33] you need as for like the little widow
[32:36] woman ask for the thing that God would
[32:38] come and and give you food on your table
[32:40] and and provision
[32:43] spiritual provision we must number three
[32:45] we must obey the Holy Spirit do what the
[32:48] spirit prompts you to do
[32:50] and you know there's a big one because
[32:52] God has given us a still small voice
[32:55] inside of us that so often we ignore and
[32:58] we won't listen to it what about you
[33:00] know you we think about the big things
[33:02] but what about the little things where
[33:04] you're leaving the house in the morning
[33:05] and you hear a still Small Voice that
[33:08] says get the keys or get your cell phone
[33:11] or or just a little small little things
[33:14] that uh God is God is concerned about
[33:18] everything from the small to the large
[33:21] and what about maybe when you're doing
[33:23] wrong when you hear that still Small
[33:25] Voice that ain't right you know the
[33:27] scripture says if they avoid even the
[33:29] appearance of evil if it even appears he
[33:32] said that Paul said that there's things
[33:34] that the world does that we shouldn't
[33:36] even talk about we shouldn't even
[33:38] approach to the we should keep our lives
[33:41] holy and Sanctified listen to that still
[33:43] Small Voice because Isaiah said in the
[33:45] latter days their car your conscience
[33:48] will be seared over as a hot iron don't
[33:50] uh
[33:51] if you keep uh listen
[33:54] you know ignore and that's still a small
[33:56] voice and it gets quieter and quieter
[33:59] there must be public confessions of
[34:02] Christ as Savior because Romans 10 10
[34:04] Romans 10 10 says confession is made
[34:06] unto salvation and you know I I know
[34:09] this is maybe a little simple message
[34:11] this morning but God gave God made a
[34:14] confession in the beginning and he
[34:15] believed his own confession he said let
[34:18] there be light and there was light he's
[34:21] he's in the beginning was the word and
[34:22] the Word was God and he confessed out of
[34:25] his mouth and he believed we confessed
[34:27] and when you confess out of the heart of
[34:30] the mouth speaketh from out of the heart
[34:32] of the mouth speaketh and out of your
[34:33] own mouth comes what you believe and
[34:36] just like what out of God's mouth came
[34:39] what he was
[34:43] and now this little Welsh Revival
[34:47] started something
[34:49] that carried on over to Azusa Street
[34:52] where William Seymour
[34:54] was uh he heard about it and he began to
[34:57] preach
[34:58] something that
[35:00] I found this was really striking he was
[35:02] preaching
[35:03] that the baptism in the Holy Ghost was
[35:06] speaking in tongues if you look back
[35:07] through history at that point in time
[35:09] they believe that the baptism of the
[35:11] Holy Ghost was sanctification and they
[35:14] uh everybody was was preaching just live
[35:16] a holy life and maybe today many times
[35:20] maybe we kind of get in the same mode as
[35:23] long as I'm living a holy life as long
[35:26] as I can feel the presence of the Lord
[35:28] as long as
[35:30] I can like in the the
[35:34] apostles you know they they were casting
[35:37] out devils and and uh believing in signs
[35:40] following just at sanctification and you
[35:43] think well just like they did well this
[35:46] is it this is the end of the road but
[35:48] Along Came William seabour and he was
[35:51] preaching something that he had never
[35:52] even experienced he had never
[35:55] experienced speaking in tongues and he
[35:58] went to this little church in in Los
[36:00] Angeles and and he started when they
[36:02] found out he was preaching something
[36:04] that they had never experienced they
[36:05] kicked him out and and put him on his
[36:08] road until one day he experienced it now
[36:12] you know you know it took a real Prophet
[36:14] to come along and show us real what the
[36:16] real evidence of the Holy Ghost was
[36:19] uh you know God Winks at our ignorance a
[36:22] lot of times but
[36:25] uh
[36:26] I I want to take a step back before I
[36:29] get in to this you know just think about
[36:31] this now God he the word is heard and
[36:35] the word is sown this the rain falls
[36:39] quickens it and it begins to grow and
[36:42] grow and all after all these revivals
[36:44] the the the word had been sown and they
[36:47] they pulled aside they pulled aside into
[36:49] their own knowledge their own ideas and
[36:52] hybrid it with their own wisdom and when
[36:55] the rain fell the let's see what's there
[36:58] it it produced death It produced
[37:00] something that went away from God's
[37:03] God's word
[37:04] now
[37:06] you uh
[37:10] there there's a something that's
[37:13] repeated through the scripture is that
[37:16] when God moves now this goes for
[37:19] receiving the Holy Ghost and down
[37:21] through the different uh the um
[37:24] manifestations of God's spirit as he
[37:26] moved through the different
[37:28] um through the different ages and things
[37:31] but when when God's spirit moves the
[37:33] believer has to keep moving along with
[37:35] it as it was the light moves you should
[37:38] stay right with that with the spirit
[37:40] moves and you know what provokes
[37:43] movement
[37:45] is a little group of people God's movers
[37:48] I believe that's what the five-fold
[37:50] ministry is to get in there and and keep
[37:53] you moving don't sit still is to provoke
[37:57] you John Wesley said the fivefold
[38:00] ministry is to provoke one another to
[38:02] jealousy to provoke you to want to be
[38:04] closer to God to provoke you to want to
[38:07] be closer to him and not just to sit
[38:11] still and get uh uh let all the the The
[38:14] Vines and things of of uh your own
[38:17] knowledge and of the world and your own
[38:19] wisdom encroach in but to keep moving
[38:22] with God
[38:24] and you know uh
[38:27] there was a people that who lived in the
[38:31] Middle East when that wanted desire to
[38:35] to find God and one day they saw a star
[38:37] and they just kept moving with that star
[38:39] and they followed it until one day it
[38:42] led them right to the word what they
[38:43] were searching for and God God will
[38:47] God's word will do that for us today if
[38:49] we'll just stay with it and follow it
[38:51] now I want to just kind of think what is
[38:56] a Revival
[38:57] what is what what would a Revival have
[39:01] looked like in the Old Testament
[39:05] and one of my favorite stories
[39:08] is
[39:09] um the story of Cain and Abel this was
[39:11] the you know the first Sunday School
[39:14] less than I ever taught
[39:16] was on this little story of Cain and
[39:19] Abel and I got to thinking what what
[39:21] would happen if Cain and Abel were alive
[39:23] today
[39:24] what were they what were their their
[39:27] demeanor be like what were they act like
[39:29] that's that's something to think upon
[39:32] what were they um
[39:35] how they behave how what would their
[39:37] reaction be to God's word
[39:41] and you know Cain and Abel both came
[39:44] from
[39:45] in Genesis 4 the story tells us that
[39:48] they both were desirous to serve God
[39:52] because they both God had given them a
[39:55] special gift he had given them something
[39:57] that animals don't have he had given
[40:00] them a soul I remember
[40:01] I remember they they uh when I was in
[40:04] grade school they passed out this little
[40:07] thing that talked about this I don't
[40:08] know if you remember Coco the gorilla
[40:10] they taught Coco how to talk and she had
[40:13] she could do sign language and answer
[40:15] questions and they they one day they
[40:17] asked Coco uh they were asking her all
[40:20] kind of questions what kind of food do
[40:21] you like best I like oranges and
[40:23] different things and they said well is
[40:26] there a god that's an interesting
[40:29] question to ask an animal
[40:31] and Coco the gorilla responded I don't
[40:34] know anything about God I don't know any
[40:37] I don't know what that is and a lot of
[40:40] people might look I think I thought back
[40:43] then when I was just a little kid that
[40:44] they were using that little article see
[40:46] there there's proof and we've asked an
[40:49] animal and this animal should know
[40:51] better than a human being with a soul
[40:54] whether there's a God or not but God
[40:57] there's the difference between an animal
[40:58] and a human is it a human has something
[41:01] that can reach out to God and and
[41:04] connect something with inside a deep
[41:07] calling to the deep and when there's a
[41:09] deep calling there's got to be a deep to
[41:11] respond there's got to be out there
[41:13] somewhere
[41:15] so they both had something calling but
[41:18] Cain was anointed with a spirit now look
[41:20] at Cain's daddy now I was looking at the
[41:23] word what subtle means because the Bible
[41:26] says that the Beast was more subtle than
[41:28] all the creatures and you know there's a
[41:31] there's a a lot of different definitions
[41:34] but subtle means that you take what it
[41:37] really means is you you well like a dog
[41:39] you just tell a dog to see it and it
[41:42] says or or you can teach a parrot to fly
[41:45] from one place to the other but
[41:47] something that's subtle can understand
[41:50] the subtle differences if you if you say
[41:53] well you know go pick me some corn or
[41:55] whatever they can understand and that
[41:58] Beast was subtle it could pick up you
[42:00] know it could it understood that little
[42:02] fine nuances of human speech and what
[42:05] what does subtle mean today it means
[42:08] people that will nitpick and and and try
[42:11] to find fault and try to find a little
[42:13] way that they can weasel in their own
[42:15] little idea and figure out a way to get
[42:18] in like like what happened in the Garden
[42:20] of Eden the Beast that said that just
[42:23] took one word out and squeezed one word
[42:26] in by the influence of Satan now so Cain
[42:30] he had that same Spirit on him he got
[42:34] that same he was along that same line
[42:36] and he he was inclined to try to get his
[42:40] own idea in there instead of taking
[42:43] God's word he had no interest in God's
[42:46] word at all no interest in keeping the
[42:50] Bible
[42:51] and I remember when uh brother Branham
[42:54] said this real simple thing that applies
[42:57] to them you know at his first pool he
[43:00] said the angel told him if you can just
[43:02] get the people to believe you
[43:05] if faith comes by hearing the word and
[43:09] Abel heard the word and he believed it
[43:13] and where did he hear the word from he
[43:15] had he heard the word from first from
[43:18] his mama and daddy as they sat down and
[43:20] and they talked to him uh and I was
[43:23] reading where brother Randolph said they
[43:24] talked to him about what had happened in
[43:26] the garden you know I'm sure you had
[43:27] many questions and he said
[43:31] he may be well you know brother Brown
[43:34] said why he wanted to know why we got
[43:38] cast out of the Garden of Eden why what
[43:41] happened and he
[43:43] mm-hmm
[43:45] he was interested in hearing all about
[43:48] the reasons why and brother Adam said
[43:51] they told him they didn't tell him all
[43:53] the truth they said it was an apple
[43:55] just like today the church has been told
[43:58] that it's an apple but you know I I
[44:02] wonder if maybe he picked up here and
[44:04] there are little details like God
[44:06] clothed us with
[44:09] with lamb skin he killed something that
[44:13] and a blood atonement was made and he
[44:15] covered us with it said something maybe
[44:17] one day he was looking out of the star
[44:19] sitting out there with God and just
[44:21] looking up at the universe and looking
[44:22] at that great Bible that God had rode in
[44:25] Heavens and he thought there's got to be
[44:29] maybe just God just quickened in his eye
[44:31] in his in his heart something
[44:35] about where he came from and where he's
[44:38] going and that'll spark a revelation
[44:40] when you see the problem when you see
[44:43] you've got to be saved and see and you
[44:45] can see the remedy that able to look
[44:47] forward and down through time and saw
[44:49] that uh that one day a lamb would be
[44:52] slain as a sacrifice for us to take away
[44:55] take our sins upon himself
[44:59] and he believed it and
[45:02] he held on by faith
[45:06] and you know this this road that Abel
[45:11] was on applies to everything from
[45:13] salvation to getting filled the Holy
[45:16] Ghost to Healing if you receive if you
[45:18] need healing just hang on I remember uh
[45:21] I remember so many things growing up I
[45:25] remember when my um my brother one time
[45:28] was sick to death in the hospital and my
[45:31] my dad and my family just held on
[45:33] believe that doctors didn't know what
[45:35] was going on what was wrong and they
[45:37] just held on and believed until God
[45:40] brought a miracle to pass I remember
[45:41] years ago that my wife the devil was
[45:44] trick her with with uh something
[45:46] horrible and we just held on until one
[45:50] day uh the a mighty rushing wind came
[45:53] through the window and she was delivered
[45:55] and if you just hold on and that's what
[45:58] Acts 2 38 is all about they were they
[46:01] were up in the upper room and they were
[46:04] holding on to God's word he told us to
[46:07] come up here and wait until we're indeed
[46:09] with power from on high and
[46:13] I believe that you know God Abel saws he
[46:18] got a revelation from God he didn't just
[46:20] get something that was in his own mind
[46:22] like King God he he believed that he he
[46:25] didn't wait for a revelation from God he
[46:28] he instead of bringing an offering by
[46:32] Revelation he brought something that he
[46:35] worked up and he brought the fruits of
[46:37] the field
[46:38] but Cain but Abel had a revelation and
[46:41] when you have a real Revelation
[46:44] then it it began as a desire in you to
[46:48] serve God now Abel's Revelation was
[46:51] brought by the word being made manifest
[46:54] the word that God quickened and he
[46:58] quickened he quickened in his life and
[47:00] began to make it manifest and that
[47:02] brought justification that brings
[47:04] justification today now sanctification
[47:07] is brought the same way you hear the
[47:09] word and it quickens in you a desire to
[47:12] serve God and I I remember I'm talking
[47:15] about a Revival what brings a Revival
[47:17] what brings a desire to serve God more
[47:21] in your life what brings a desire to
[47:23] want to glorify him in your flesh to see
[47:27] him glorified and
[47:29] we were talking in Sunday school about
[47:32] sanctification and just being Holiness
[47:34] and God requires
[47:37] God will never be pleased outside of a
[47:41] Sanctified life and we read in Ephesians
[47:43] how you before you can see God before
[47:46] before you can really before you could
[47:50] enter the holy of holies that that the
[47:52] Old Testament priest had to be
[47:54] Sanctified they had to have everything
[47:55] in orderly order they had to have
[47:58] everything just so and if they didn't
[47:59] they had that long rope that trailed
[48:02] outside of the holy of holies that they
[48:04] would be the the high priest would and
[48:06] he would be dragged out because if if he
[48:08] didn't have everything just perfectly
[48:10] lined up and we read it we read in in
[48:13] Sunday School in Malachi chapter three
[48:15] it talks about the the the Forerunner to
[48:19] to the to the one whom you seek that
[48:22] will quickly come to his Temple how that
[48:24] he would prepare the way of the Lord
[48:27] because the way had to be made straight
[48:30] everything had to be made ready for the
[48:33] one that the one that they saw to come
[48:36] to the temple and when he finally came
[48:38] to the temple what he found was that
[48:40] there they weren't ready they weren't
[48:42] prepared they they had not heard the
[48:44] message of the day they hadn't heard
[48:46] what had been preached and when he got
[48:48] to the temple they instead of living
[48:51] Sanctified holy lives they were living
[48:55] they were Desiring after money and
[48:58] things of this world and
[49:02] so we did the only thing he could
[49:04] because God his design can't be broken
[49:09] before the word could come to the temple
[49:12] it had to be purified so he took his
[49:14] whip up and beat him out and I was
[49:17] thinking you know just think about the
[49:20] approach that God takes a lot of times
[49:22] when you discipline your kids is it is
[49:24] it to drive them away from you or is it
[49:27] to drive them to you and and my wife and
[49:30] I a lot of times you know when we spank
[49:32] our kids my wife spanks the kids and and
[49:35] then they'll come running to me
[49:37] or I'll spank the kids and they'll go
[49:40] running to her but we always we try to
[49:43] put us put a stop to that because that's
[49:45] not what discipline is about that's not
[49:47] what weapons are about is you give the
[49:50] whooping you give the loving because God
[49:53] when God whips us it's not to drive us
[49:56] away from him it's to drive us to him he
[50:00] gives us a whooping and we come back to
[50:02] him God forgive me of what I've done God
[50:05] forgive me I've done wrong and he he's
[50:09] drawing us to him that's what he was
[50:11] trying to do I believe when he whipped
[50:13] him out of the temple he wasn't trying
[50:14] to drive him away from himself but he
[50:17] was trying to get them to serve God he
[50:20] was trying to put something in them
[50:22] you're not doing it right and you know
[50:26] if you whip your kids in Anger you're
[50:27] not doing it right if you drive them
[50:29] away from you you're not if you don't
[50:31] don't do it in love you're not doing it
[50:34] right
[50:35] and down through this whole journey of
[50:38] Cain and Abel from justification
[50:40] sanctification it was driven just like
[50:42] the the widow woman's journey by their
[50:47] desire Abel's desire and Cain didn't
[50:49] have a desire for the word but Abel did
[50:52] Abel had a desire whatever it takes Lord
[50:55] if you'll reveal yourself to me then
[50:58] I'll I'll whatever it takes and so we
[51:00] took up by Revelation he took up that
[51:03] bleeding lamb and he began to drag it
[51:06] down to the sacrifice and you know the
[51:09] word made manifest in your life always
[51:12] produces separation
[51:15] it always you know when Abel took up
[51:18] that little lamb and started dragging
[51:20] him and Kane looked over there and said
[51:21] what are you doing Abel what what kind
[51:24] of a messy business is this I'm I'm sure
[51:28] that created quite a separation and
[51:30] God's God's word made manifest in your
[51:33] life always creates a separation because
[51:36] it breeds an atmosphere real Holiness
[51:39] creates an atmosphere and you create if
[51:42] you if your home is Holy then you have a
[51:45] different kind of atmosphere you'll have
[51:47] an atmosphere where you know I believe a
[51:50] a real message of believer in families
[51:52] home has the tapes playing
[51:54] have that Bible open up on your just a
[51:57] Bible open up on the dresser creates a
[52:00] different atmosphere you know if you
[52:02] look down at the beginning of the
[52:03] creation God God type when God the
[52:07] brother said first the world was in
[52:10] darkness and then he God said let there
[52:13] be light and that light that brother
[52:15] Branham said was the word that went
[52:17] forth and you know a lot of people look
[52:18] at look at those the days of creation
[52:21] and they'll say why did light come forth
[52:23] on the first day but the Sun and the
[52:26] Moon weren't put in the heavens until
[52:27] the fourth day that's so odd but now you
[52:30] look at it and the it almost mirrors
[52:33] your journey
[52:34] because you were in darkness groping in
[52:37] darkness groping at things of the world
[52:39] and then God's word Shone on you and
[52:42] then on the second day what happened the
[52:45] the word had Shone on the earth and it
[52:48] created a separation he took the
[52:50] firmament and he separated he pulled it
[52:52] apart and put the atmosphere in the
[52:54] heaven and put the water over the Earth
[52:55] and then that atmosphere what did it be
[52:58] get it beget life and after the the
[53:02] light of the word shown on the earth and
[53:04] that that atmosphere came over the earth
[53:07] and the the the the moisture and things
[53:09] then the the third day the the season
[53:13] that were in the earth began to come
[53:14] forth if you create an atmosphere in
[53:16] your home around God's word and the
[53:19] atmosphere is attitude your attitude to
[53:22] God's word if you get in the right
[53:24] attitude your emotions and objectives
[53:26] aligned up right with God's word it'll
[53:28] break see God's word brick come to pass
[53:30] and see see things change in your home
[53:33] and in your life life if you just
[53:36] surround yourself read the Bible in the
[53:38] morning and pray and create an
[53:40] atmosphere of worship see God's word may
[53:44] come to pass and I was thinking about
[53:46] how you know when Jesus came to the
[53:50] temple he wasn't very timid but the Holy
[53:52] Ghost is timid
[53:53] the Holy Ghost is timid and and that
[53:56] Holy your holy life you got to live holy
[54:00] so that you can see God because the Holy
[54:02] Ghost when you do brother I've said even
[54:04] when you go a little bit over the speed
[54:06] limit then that Holy Spirit that will
[54:08] just go like up on a limb because he's
[54:10] timid he don't want to stay around
[54:12] unbelief and doing wrong and things and
[54:15] create that atmosphere where the Holy
[54:18] Spirit feels welcome and can come into
[54:21] your home and you brother Brown preached
[54:24] the sermon doors and a door where you
[54:26] know he talked about not having one door
[54:28] of your heart shut off to him well what
[54:30] about the doors of your home where you
[54:33] got your kids shut up in the room
[54:34] somewhere doing who knows what and and
[54:37] can't have don't have enough assumption
[54:39] to go up and say you can't live like
[54:42] this kids you can't you can't do this uh
[54:46] you know we're not the holy the holy
[54:51] life requires us to have a little
[54:52] backbone with our with our families and
[54:55] with our uh you know
[54:58] let me just stop there
[55:02] you know Luke 175 says we shouldn't a
[55:06] sanctification in the Holy life isn't
[55:08] just a phase of your life right before
[55:10] you get the Holy Ghost but it's
[55:11] something that you live for the rest of
[55:13] your days Luke said Holiness and
[55:16] righteousness all the days of your life
[55:18] and when you're holy
[55:21] I can't believe it I'm running out of
[55:22] time
[55:24] oh
[55:26] when when when able
[55:29] when they were brought that sacrifice
[55:33] to the altar
[55:35] brother Brown said full obedience
[55:37] entitles you to the Token full obedience
[55:40] entitles you to everything that God's
[55:42] word has allowed and so he
[55:48] there was actually a lot of quotes I was
[55:50] going to read but um
[55:52] full obedience and so Abel brought his
[55:56] sacrifice to the altar
[55:58] and laid it on the Altar and you know
[56:01] when you get to the to the baptism of
[56:04] the Holy Ghost to complete the new birth
[56:07] you know a lot of people look at you you
[56:09] begin to pull things out of scripture
[56:12] and and like brother Branham did where
[56:16] is that what where does it say what the
[56:19] seventh seal is where does it say how
[56:23] God received Abel's sacrifice where does
[56:26] it say that
[56:28] Abraham and Sarah were turned back but
[56:30] it does say it but the only way that you
[56:33] can know you can understand because
[56:40] you know he that heareth and believeth
[56:42] on him that sent me Jesus said he that
[56:44] heareth the word is sown and then not
[56:47] just believes not just say I believe it
[56:49] but to understand that is the evidence
[56:52] to understand God's word to have it
[56:55] revealed in you to have it be brought to
[56:57] life just like on the third day and now
[57:00] Abel came to that to the to the Altar
[57:03] and Cain was looking on
[57:05] and and maybe like just like in the the
[57:08] upper room they were wondering what's
[57:09] going to happen What what will be the
[57:12] evidence of the sacrifice being accepted
[57:15] what will be the fruit How Will I Know
[57:18] will it just be well I've done it I put
[57:21] the lamb up on the altar enough and it's
[57:24] there
[57:25] but
[57:27] maybe Abel waited a little bit
[57:30] like you know Elijah wasn't scared when
[57:32] he put He told him to put water all
[57:36] around the altar with that sacrifice and
[57:38] he he challenged them you know let your
[57:40] your Gods come over here and and uh do
[57:43] whatever you want to do hack on
[57:44] yourselves beat yourselves whatever it
[57:46] takes whatever you feel is necessary
[57:49] but you know when you come according to
[57:51] God's plan when you know God's plan and
[57:54] purpose you can rest on it and have
[57:57] faith that you have done everything
[57:59] that's required not just wait wait for
[58:01] healing to be made manifest wait for his
[58:04] promises to come to fruit
[58:07] and so Abel sat and watched and waited
[58:10] and Cane washed and waited and something
[58:12] happened that came does it still doesn't
[58:14] understand to this day
[58:17] that the fire fell because brother
[58:20] Branham said that he that God Vindicated
[58:24] Abel's Sacrifice by consuming it
[58:28] and we know that because he's Hebrews 13
[58:31] 8 the same yesterday today and forever
[58:34] and he does it one if he does something
[58:36] one way he'll do it that way forever and
[58:39] ever and you know one day he's going to
[58:41] purge this Earth by a holy fire and wipe
[58:43] out all the sin and everything from it
[58:46] just like he does in the Believers heart
[58:48] that by a holy consuming fire he comes
[58:50] rolling through and cleans out
[58:52] everything that shouldn't be there and
[58:54] leaves behind the statue of a perfect
[58:56] man come rolling through and leaves
[58:59] virtue and knowledge and Temperance and
[59:01] leaves his Holiness behind you and his
[59:04] godliness and I believe
[59:07] you know brother brand I've talked about
[59:09] how a a tree when when the leaves come
[59:13] up on it you don't say well
[59:16] there's you look for an Evidence in the
[59:19] in the the fall this time of year is the
[59:21] trees the leaves are falling off the off
[59:24] the off of the trees there's going to be
[59:26] a new life that comes up in that tree
[59:28] next year just to create an illustration
[59:31] and when when the believer gets filled
[59:33] with the Holy Ghost a new life comes up
[59:35] that's an everlasting Revival something
[59:38] that that you can't fake and I look at
[59:41] Cain and Abel one was faking it one was
[59:44] trying to go in on their own knowledge
[59:47] and on their on their own understanding
[59:48] on their own ideas and the other was
[59:51] going in on Revelation
[59:54] oh I mean
[59:56] let me see what quote I was going to
[59:58] read
[1:00:02] let's read
[1:00:07] oh my
[1:00:09] actually let me just go ahead and finish
[1:00:12] up I'm I'm not even going to get close
[1:00:14] to some of these but um
[1:00:20] you know God God told a
[1:00:24] and the word is told about the the five
[1:00:27] wise and the five foolish virgins and
[1:00:30] and they uh what the difference was
[1:00:32] between them was one held on to their
[1:00:34] own ideas
[1:00:36] and they owned denominational ideas and
[1:00:38] their denominational creeds
[1:00:40] uh the musicians can go ahead and come
[1:00:43] forward and the uh the wise the wise and
[1:00:48] the fullest the wise
[1:00:50] took God at his word and waited for
[1:00:52] Revelation and let that seed be sold in
[1:00:55] their heart and let the Spirit come and
[1:00:57] Quicken it now just to finish up what
[1:01:00] what I was going when I was walking to
[1:01:02] the to work from the Train
[1:01:05] you know the spirit the spirit of the
[1:01:07] Lord fell on me the word had been sold
[1:01:09] in my heart and the spirit fell on me
[1:01:12] and and I was walking along just under
[1:01:14] the power and the anointing of the Holy
[1:01:16] Spirit as his word was revealed
[1:01:20] and something strange happened I I I
[1:01:23] turned the corner this was real early in
[1:01:25] the morning
[1:01:28] and I turned the corner and there was
[1:01:30] nobody else on the street I was walking
[1:01:32] next to the Federal Reserve building
[1:01:33] they got their big arm guard with the
[1:01:35] security guards with their machine guns
[1:01:37] and and bomb sniffing dogs and I turned
[1:01:39] the corner and there was nobody else on
[1:01:42] the street
[1:01:42] but just as I turned somebody else
[1:01:46] stepped in front of me this uh this
[1:01:48] woman that was you know dressed like the
[1:01:50] world and uh she was listening to
[1:01:53] something on her Walkman and the spirit
[1:01:56] of the Lord was all over the place just
[1:01:59] quickening that word
[1:02:01] and now you all know I'm not saying this
[1:02:03] to make myself anything God forbid but
[1:02:07] the spirit was right there and she began
[1:02:10] to raise up her arms and shout and
[1:02:13] glorify God and she began to praise God
[1:02:15] and I thought what a strange situation
[1:02:18] this is now I'm walking down the street
[1:02:20] and I just heard the prophet I've just
[1:02:22] heard Elijah and the words being
[1:02:24] quickened to me and now this woman that
[1:02:27] maybe she doesn't even know what's going
[1:02:30] on but for some reason she got in that
[1:02:32] presence and she began to glorify God
[1:02:35] and now I think there's the real
[1:02:37] difference between Cain and Abel today
[1:02:39] one uh just it's not just get in the
[1:02:43] presence there's the difference between
[1:02:45] a real a real Revival not just get in
[1:02:47] the presence and get in the spirit and
[1:02:49] and Shout a little bit and then go home
[1:02:51] back to your old ways your own your your
[1:02:54] thinking and but but to let God's word
[1:02:57] take root in you like that sword that
[1:03:01] went forth to sow that brother Branham
[1:03:03] you know he saw that vision of the two
[1:03:04] Shores that the Earth was all tilled up
[1:03:06] and one went out sowing good seed and
[1:03:08] the other bad seed
[1:03:10] but to let that good seed take root in
[1:03:12] you and bring forth life and then you've
[1:03:15] got a fire that's Kindle in you that
[1:03:17] will never die and

[1:03:53] Lord but maybe Lord you can put it
[1:03:55] straighten it out into people's minds
[1:03:57] and Lord Jesus that a real true Revival
[1:04:00] is not built on emotions it's not built
[1:04:02] on something that we our own knowledge
[1:04:05] or our own intellect our own wisdom but
[1:04:07] it's built upon the revealed word Made
[1:04:10] Alive in our hearts Lord Jesus Lord God
[1:04:13] every uplifted hand Lord Jesus I pray
[1:04:15] that you'll touch them Lord and reach
[1:04:17] out Lord God and make your word manifest
[1:04:19] in them Lord Jesus and help them Lord of
[1:04:22] God Lord my desires it'll not be one

[1:04:33] be with brother Aaron this afternoon and
[1:04:35] be with all the ones that we requested
[1:04:37] prayer for this morning Lord Jesus

[1:04:41] same yesterday today and forever you're

[1:05:18] number 88 number 88 88 anybody have a
[1:05:22] need
[1:05:24] just come and let's see if God is real
[1:05:40] anybody else just come and let's see
[1:05:47] so take me
[1:05:59] anybody else would have a need
[1:06:16] anybody else
[1:06:34] you heard a great message now come and
[1:06:36] reap the benefits
[1:06:37] because it's a simple thing
[1:06:41] to just believe Jesus Christ
[1:06:44] just accept him
[1:06:48] it'll bring a Revival you know I've been
[1:06:51] praying for that for a long time
[1:06:54] this church to be revived
[1:06:58] but you know it's got to start in me
[1:07:00] because I'm the pastor
[1:07:03] let me get rid of myself let me walk in
[1:07:07] it but it don't have to start just by me
[1:07:09] or with me to start with anybody and
[1:07:12] then it'll come to me
[1:07:14] because it can be just anything you
[1:07:16] remember
[1:07:17] great Revival started One Time by just a
[1:07:21] lady cleaning the church she was just
[1:07:24] rubbing the pews and cleaning them she
[1:07:28] was just praying Lord you blessed this
[1:07:29] sister sits right here you bless this
[1:07:31] brother sits right here you know what it
[1:07:34] started a Revival
[1:07:37] know that everybody ought to have a
[1:07:38] party
[1:07:42] you see we we think about a Revival
[1:07:46] Reviving is for a Christian
[1:07:50] you can't revive a sinner he's lost he
[1:07:53] needs to get saved
[1:07:57] but you can revive a Christian because
[1:08:00] he got something to revive
[1:08:04] something to come forward
[1:08:06] anybody else have a need
[1:08:10] foreign
[1:08:16] let's see if that same God lives
[1:08:52] what about do you know that savior
[1:08:59] she's in a Revival not for you until you
[1:09:02] know him
[1:09:10] because God can come on the scene and he
[1:09:12] can make us live
[1:09:15] what about anybody else
[1:09:23] foreign
[1:09:53] you know you don't have to have a group
[1:09:55] to have a Revival
[1:09:58] in your heart
[1:10:03] ever since God brought this word to me
[1:10:05] and the truth of the end times I've been
[1:10:07] in a Revival oh yeah I have down days
[1:10:10] and bad days right
[1:10:13] but I refuse to let them conquer me
[1:10:17] why because there's something in there
[1:10:18] that's boiling
[1:10:21] come in there that's alive
[1:10:26] something that can take care of all my
[1:10:28] troubles and problems
[1:10:30] anybody else
[1:10:35] people
[1:10:37] you keep in trouble
[1:10:39] that's your problem
[1:10:41] see people won't admit they got
[1:10:44] something wrong
[1:10:46] it's embarrassing to admit the wrong why
[1:10:54] because we're all wrong
[1:10:55] nobody don't look down on anybody else
[1:11:01] if somebody's looking down on somebody
[1:11:03] because of what they are or whatever you
[1:11:06] need a good case of Salvation
[1:11:08] we're looking up
[1:11:11] to a savior a redeemer a leader
[1:11:16] then sure we gotta have the word God is
[1:11:19] true
[1:11:20] it's got to be done it's true it's right
[1:11:34] anybody else
[1:11:44] oh
[1:11:47] foreign
[1:11:55] amen and amen and amen
[1:11:58] just tell her brother how much you
[1:12:00] appreciate the message could we do we
[1:12:02] believe it we appreciate it appreciate
[1:12:03] God speaking to his heart and him
