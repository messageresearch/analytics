[4:02] they're traveling just bring them back
[4:03] safely Lord we commit it all into your
[4:06] hands and ask it in Jesus Christ name
[4:09] amen amen praise the Lord let's turn to
[4:12] Hebrews chapter 11 verse
[4:19] 30 Hebrews 11:30 it says by faith the
[4:22] walls of Jericho fell down after they
[4:26] were compassed about seven days
[4:30] notice the key thing there is by faith
[4:33] the walls of Jericho there was no
[4:35] problem for God to knock him down it was
[4:37] the faith that the children of Israel
[4:39] that God was trying to work trying to
[4:41] work on lifting up that Faith he could
[4:43] take care of the walls of Jericho so
[4:45] it's the same with your life he could
[4:46] take care of any situation in your life
[4:48] it's just he's working on that Faith
[4:51] amen you and our faith you know we we
[4:53] sometimes we have we we we we have weak
[4:56] Faith but but God is trying to work on
[4:58] that Faith so by faith the walls of
[4:59] Jericho fell down after they were
[5:02] compassed about 7 days and by faith the
[5:05] Harlot Rahab perished not with them that
[5:08] believed not when she had received the
[5:11] spies with peace amen and then also
[5:14] while you're standing in James chapter 2
[5:17] verse 25 and
[5:19] 26 James
[5:21] 2:25 the Bible says likewise also was
[5:25] not Rahab the Harlot justified by works
[5:29] when she had received the messengers and
[5:32] had sent them out another way for as the
[5:36] body without the spirit is dead so faith
[5:40] without works is dead also amen may God
[5:45] add a blessing to the reading of your
[5:46] word you may be seated this a this
[5:49] evening amen I want to speak this
[5:51] evening I want to talk about faith that
[5:53] seizes the moment faith that seizes the
[5:56] moment amen you know and if you want to
[5:59] if you want to uh uh Listen to A good
[6:02] sermon brother Brandon preached amen his
[6:05] his uh Works uh uh Works expressed by
[6:09] faith I believe is the title of it um
[6:11] Works Express faith in
[6:14] 1965 and um and so he he mentions a lot
[6:17] about about this but I want to talk
[6:20] about this evening uh about faith
[6:22] seizing the moment and you know here in
[6:25] James chap 2: 26 it says for as the body
[6:28] without the spirit is dead amen so you
[6:32] know you take a body you know that has
[6:34] not the spirit amen you could pretty
[6:37] much just say that it's dead you know
[6:39] it's not functioning because the spirit
[6:41] is what is what is where the realm of
[6:43] the emotions are and the realm of the of
[6:45] the of the of the love and and and and
[6:49] hate and those different types of uh uh
[6:52] emotions and so if all that is is not
[6:55] there amen you might as well just
[6:56] consider the body dead you know and and
[6:59] so but so Faith so James types it in
[7:02] with so faith without works is dead also
[7:07] amen praise God you you we can all say
[7:09] that we have faith amen we all we we say
[7:13] oh we're we we're fighting for the faith
[7:16] you see we're we're we're Marching for
[7:18] Faith or we're we're we're we're
[7:20] pressing amen we're fighting this this
[7:22] battle of Faith amen or we have faith
[7:25] and and I believe that we all do
[7:26] otherwise you wouldn't be here amen you
[7:29] have faith in somewhat at least in the
[7:31] word of God Amen that that it can do
[7:33] something for you otherwise you would
[7:35] not use your time you could be better go
[7:37] off and play putt putt right now or or
[7:40] go do something go wash your car you
[7:41] know enjoy this nice weather amen but
[7:44] you have faith in the word amen that it
[7:47] it can that it can say something and to
[7:50] change your life change your situation
[7:53] change amen your motives maybe something
[7:55] that you're praying about amen whatever
[7:57] it may be you have faith that the word
[7:59] of God Amen that you come here to listen
[8:02] amen can do something for you praise God
[8:04] so faith without works is dead also and
[8:07] the the the fact that you came to church
[8:11] shows that your faith is in action amen
[8:15] praise God and that's what James is
[8:16] saying that your faith if you say that
[8:19] you have faith then you must show action
[8:22] behind that Faith amen there there is no
[8:25] such thing as silent Faith praise God or
[8:29] sometimes we might think that that Faith
[8:31] oh it's just something silent I have
[8:33] faith you know I have faith but really
[8:36] true faith it it it stands out there's
[8:40] actions behind true Faith amen amen
[8:42] praise God you you see Faith amen when
[8:45] there is true Faith why brother brand
[8:48] said faith has hair in its chest praise
[8:51] God that's that's that's kind of
[8:54] disgusting I guess but but but you know
[8:57] when you see a hair on your chest you
[8:59] know you know some women are I don't
[9:01] know about that
[9:02] but but you see it there and and it's
[9:06] manifested right and it means it's Burly
[9:08] you see something that's Burly something
[9:10] that's strong something that has Faith
[9:13] amen and and and I've been around
[9:15] brothers and sisters and and and you
[9:17] know you can't help to be to be love to
[9:19] be around them because they just boost
[9:21] your faith right up amen they have so
[9:24] much confidence in their walk with God
[9:26] they have so much confidence in the word
[9:28] of God their experience has brought them
[9:30] to that point that you can't just you
[9:32] can't help but walk in the same in the
[9:34] same anointing that they're in amen
[9:37] praise God so faith without works is
[9:41] dead you must show amen that you have if
[9:44] you have faith amen if you believe that
[9:46] this word is true then let let us see
[9:49] the results of that Faith amen right
[9:53] praise God now uh there's another part
[9:55] in Romans where where where it talks
[9:57] about you know that that faith amen you
[10:00] need Faith Amen in order for for
[10:02] salvation amen and and that and that
[10:04] works don't don't help that Faith but
[10:07] you see we you need you need them both
[10:09] amen praise God you need faith and you
[10:11] need the works praise God faith when God
[10:15] Amen is looking that the RO where where
[10:17] where Paul was talking about that faith
[10:19] in Romans is when God's looking at your
[10:21] faith amen James here is talking about
[10:23] when man sees what you're doing praise
[10:26] God you see that the works that you
[10:28] manifest is what you and I see praise
[10:31] the Lord you say you have faith in the
[10:33] word of God Amen let's see you manifest
[10:36] it then right and that's the scary part
[10:39] that's the part it's easy to read it and
[10:41] I'll just take it in I have faith Lord
[10:45] amen but when it really comes down to
[10:46] the hot water do you really have faith
[10:49] amen that and that's that's what God is
[10:51] trying to do and I believe even the
[10:53] things that we're seeing nowadays amen
[10:55] is coming down to that point where
[10:58] everything that you said you have it's
[11:00] going to be squeezed out of you some way
[11:03] or another amen praise the lord it's
[11:06] going it's going to
[11:08] be sque squeezed out of you and you've
[11:11] got to have faith in what God has given
[11:13] you what you have believed amen praise
[11:16] the Lord those are the times I believe
[11:18] that people are going to are going to
[11:19] leave this faith and they're and you're
[11:22] going to see people manifesting uh
[11:24] really who they are the Judas is and
[11:27] we're seeing it now they cannot take on
[11:31] the the the the you know the everything
[11:34] that that's going on they think it's
[11:35] just too harsh the the the the preachers
[11:37] are just too much and everything like
[11:39] that so what do they do they just leave
[11:42] that really shows that they didn't
[11:43] really have faith in this word like they
[11:45] said they did oh they shouted about
[11:48] it oh you saw them yelling uh shouting
[11:52] and running the AES and they were
[11:54] upfront amen and jumping up and down and
[11:56] everything back in the 80s and 90s but
[11:59] where they are now where are they at now
[12:02] you see so Faith amen true Faith amen
[12:06] stands stands in the m in the midst of
[12:08] no matter what the situation is praise
[12:10] the Lord amen and and I'm just wondering
[12:13] if any one of you has ever had to make a
[12:16] decision amen where uh like right on the
[12:19] spot I mean I know that I have many
[12:22] times you know you you you have to make
[12:24] a a a decision and you don't have time
[12:27] to even think about you know what what
[12:30] what what the what the uh what the um
[12:33] what uh what's the outcome of that
[12:36] choice is going to be but you just
[12:38] commit it to the Lord and you say Lord
[12:40] this is what I'm doing and I'm just
[12:41] moving on Amen and sometimes God puts us
[12:44] in those places amen where you have to
[12:46] make a split second decision amen but
[12:48] God blesses that decision amen praise
[12:51] the Lord amen and and so um and so we're
[12:55] looking at here at faith that seizes the
[12:57] moment and and I was just looking at
[12:58] this word seize and you know this is
[13:01] where we get the word seizure and which
[13:04] means a sudden attack or spasm amen it's
[13:08] a sudden and uh it happens all of a
[13:11] sudden but but there's a there's another
[13:13] there's another uh uh a couple of more
[13:16] definitions and it says physically
[13:18] taking control of something Often by
[13:22] force amen physically taking control of
[13:25] something Often by force uh and I like
[13:29] this this one grasping an opportunity or
[13:32] a moment amen grasping an opportunity or
[13:36] a moment and when you grasp something
[13:38] you're not Loosely grabbing onto it
[13:40] you're fully taking of hold of it amen
[13:43] where you won't let it go amen I'm
[13:46] reminded of Jacob Amen in the in in the
[13:48] Old Testament amen where he would not
[13:50] let go amen of when God appeared to him
[13:53] as a man and he wrestled he was in
[13:55] despair Jacob was he was in despair
[13:58] because he was getting ready to meet his
[13:59] his brother Esau and it had been years
[14:01] that he had not seen him and he had
[14:03] already his his wives and and the Lord
[14:06] had blessed him but now being that he
[14:08] had was blessed he had money he had he
[14:12] had family his he had lots of
[14:14] possessions and things and and and and
[14:16] yet he was scared to go see his brother
[14:20] because he knew that he had done his
[14:22] brother
[14:23] wrong but we knew that it was part of
[14:25] the uh part of the of the plan of God
[14:28] and so Jak Amen in despair he goes up
[14:31] into that top of the mountain or that
[14:33] hill and as he's praying amen the man
[14:35] appears in front of him and and and and
[14:38] and and he realizes something grabs a
[14:40] hold of Jacob amen something in his
[14:42] heart told him that's
[14:44] God Amen that that's got to be God that
[14:47] that can't be anyone else it's got to be
[14:49] God and he took of he took a hold of him
[14:51] and started wrestling with
[14:53] him amen and wrestling with him he did
[14:57] and and and and and they wrestled all
[14:59] night the Bible said but he would not
[15:01] let it go he said he said the man said
[15:04] let me go and he said I will not let you
[15:06] go until you bless me amen I don't think
[15:09] he was asking a a regular man for that
[15:12] blessing he he had to know that that was
[15:14] God Amen and it was God praise God how
[15:17] did he know it was something that had
[15:19] come down down to his heart spark it
[15:22] sparked faith enough to to be able to
[15:24] grab him and and not let him go and stay
[15:27] and fight all night long amen and I'm
[15:29] wondering if you and I are willing to do
[15:31] that Amen in our in our Christian walk
[15:33] this evening amen are you willing how
[15:35] much are you willing to fight for what
[15:37] belongs to you how much what are you
[15:40] willing to do Amen to obtain that
[15:43] promise that God has given you amen just
[15:46] like Jacob amen I will not let you go
[15:48] Lord until you give me a sure word and
[15:50] something amen that I could go face my
[15:52] brother with well he gave him even more
[15:54] than that amen right praise God he gave
[15:57] him a an assurance amen even in so much
[16:00] that it changed his walk from that day
[16:02] forward amen that's right praise God
[16:06] physically and so how much are you
[16:07] willing to do amen with with just like
[16:11] just like Jacob amen he took hold of
[16:13] God's of God's uh uh of God's word and
[16:16] of God's promise praise the Lord you
[16:20] know I I like I like sister uh I like
[16:22] what sister Hattie wrright did amen we
[16:23] all know the story of sister hady Wright
[16:26] and brother brandom's well let me read
[16:28] you this last position this last uh
[16:31] um um definition here of the word sees
[16:34] taking legal possession of property
[16:37] through Authority
[16:39] amen amen you know Satan doesn't belong
[16:41] in your property right it doesn't belong
[16:44] Amen in your house doesn't belong in
[16:46] Amen to your children amen you have the
[16:49] right by God's word to take a hold of
[16:51] that property because it belongs to you
[16:53] amen praise the Lord Jesus so brother
[16:56] Bram says here in the message but I I
[16:58] have heard but now I see speaking about
[17:00] how he write and he said and I said
[17:03] you've got a father and mother setting
[17:05] here that's old you haven't got any
[17:07] money ask for the money and see if it
[17:10] comes in your lap ask for your sister
[17:13] and see if she don't get up and
[17:15] walk and then brother BR says I knew
[17:18] then I like that I knew then like job
[17:22] there's just something you know when you
[17:24] strike it amen there's just something
[17:27] that you know amen that it seemed like
[17:29] that that's what happened to Jacob there
[17:31] something that he knew that when you
[17:33] strike it amen praise God when you know
[17:36] when you strike it said I know in other
[17:38] words you know that you know amen praise
[17:41] God and that was the reason why brother
[17:43] brand could say Hade ask whatever you
[17:45] want amen and God will give it to you
[17:47] right here and then amen what what what
[17:49] kind of uh person amen would would dare
[17:52] ask that to a human being amen but but
[17:55] brother brandham felt amen that
[17:56] anointing something struck him amen and
[17:59] it was real and he knew praise the Lord
[18:03] and that's the thing that we need to
[18:04] know amen not not just think that we
[18:08] know we know amen before we act on our
[18:11] faith praise God because brother Bram
[18:13] said that faith is a
[18:15] revelation amen I always like to think
[18:18] of a revelation as kind of like as
[18:20] something that curtains opening and you
[18:22] see everything in plain view praise God
[18:26] everything in plain view it's no secret
[18:28] and so when you see something in plain
[18:31] view amen there is nothing hidden from
[18:33] you so you could say I know and you can
[18:36] act upon that right there and then amen
[18:38] praise God that's why brother BR always
[18:41] say faith is a revelation amen because
[18:44] when it's revealed to you and it's true
[18:47] Faith you then go and have the Assurance
[18:51] to go act upon that Faith amen amen
[18:53] praise God but when it's not true Faith
[18:56] amen then you're teetering on it amen
[18:59] and you're not sure and and sometimes
[19:00] you know in the in the mission field and
[19:02] in other you know other places you can
[19:04] really see sometimes the people that
[19:06] come up for prayer and you're praying
[19:08] for them prayer lines you can you can
[19:10] see in the people's faces even the faith
[19:12] that they have or the lack of thereof
[19:15] because some of them as they come and
[19:16] tell you about their problem and things
[19:18] like well I hope that God can do this
[19:20] for me I I I think that he can but I
[19:23] want you to pray for me you know but
[19:25] then there's some that said I know that
[19:26] God can do it for me but pray with me
[19:28] brother away from me and hey man it
[19:30] lifts your faith up praise God you see
[19:33] and it makes you act differently it
[19:35] makes you act
[19:36] crazy when you have true Faith amen it
[19:39] makes you act ridiculous and it makes
[19:41] you talk different and it makes you talk
[19:44] different amen and and ridiculous but
[19:46] amen that is how true Faith works praise
[19:49] the lord it's ridiculous amen but it
[19:52] works
[19:54] hallelujah amen and brother Bram said I
[19:56] knew then like job there is just
[19:59] something you know when you strike it
[20:00] said I know here I stand before about 10
[20:04] people and know and so there was other

[21:06] might be feeling the most rotten that
[21:07] you've ever felt amen I feel wonderful
[21:10] amen because why I know God paid the
[21:12] price for my healing amen and I know
[21:15] that the healing is there I'm just
[21:16] waiting for it to manifest amen I know
[21:19] that my children are not there amen but

[22:00] little woman and and all at

[22:06] brother brandham the greatest desire in
[22:09] my heart is the Salvation of my two
[22:13] boys amen so everything amen she could

[22:22] spot amen ask what you will sister
[22:24] Hattie I feel it i' it struck me amen
[22:27] and if you don't if and if God doesn't

[22:31] false prophet amen and she was put right
[22:34] on the spot can you imagine that can you
[22:37] imagine being put on the spot by a
[22:39] prophet of God to say to to ask whatever

[22:46] the healing of your sister you can ask
[22:48] for the for the your parents healing
[22:50] whatever you want amen and what and what
[22:53] she asked for amen was something that
[22:56] was already in her heart and it was the
[22:59] salvation of her two of her two children
[23:02] amen nothing nothing about herself
[23:05] nothing about money amen it was about
[23:09] the benefit of someone else that she
[23:11] loved
[23:13] amen praise God that must have already
[23:15] been in her heart the reason why she
[23:17] asked that she said brother BR the
[23:20] greatest desire in my heart is the
[23:22] Salvation of my two boys I said give you
[23:25] I give you your boys in the name of
[23:27] Jesus Christ
[23:29] and them snickering laughing fun making
[23:32] boys fell across their mother's lap and
[23:35] surrendered their life to God and was
[23:37] filled with the Holy Ghost right
[23:40] there and and and brother Bram said that
[23:43] there they were snickering laughing
[23:46] making
[23:47] fun and they fell across their mother's
[23:50] lap amen
[23:53] repenting so it doesn't matter what your
[23:55] kids are doing today amen these kids
[23:58] were making fun of what was going on
[23:59] right there and God struck them right
[24:01] there at that moment right God can take
[24:03] care of your daughter God can take care
[24:05] of your of your son no matter what
[24:07] they're doing right now amen he can make
[24:09] that pillow so hard that they have no

[24:16] ones amen praise the lord lord make that
[24:19] pillow so hard at night that they just
[24:20] don't they have no other choice Lord but
[24:23] but to just come to God Amen they know
[24:26] your word amen and that that word
[24:28] something Sparks in them and they
[24:30] realize I need God amen amen praise the
[24:33] Lord I need my own conviction I need my
[24:35] own experience with God and if God could
[24:38] do it for those two children those two
[24:40] boys sister Hat's uh two boys amen what
[24:43] can he do for you and I what can you do
[24:45] for our children amen who still have
[24:48] hope who still come to church you know

[25:03] to church keep letting them hear the
[25:05] word don't stop telling them about God
[25:08] Amen keep being aike to them parents
[25:11] amen and I believe that God that
[25:13] whatever you do will not will not return
[25:14] back void that's right whatever you do
[25:17] that's out based from the word of God
[25:19] and that has to do with God Amen they'll
[25:21] see it and it will not return back void
[25:23] praise the Lord amen so just keep that
[25:26] Faith amen for your lost loved ones
[25:28] amen praise the Lord Jesus so we're
[25:31] talking about faith that seizes the
[25:33] moment faith that takes advantage of the
[25:36] moment faith that sees the moment amen
[25:40] and faith that that that says if I don't
[25:42] strike now amen I don't know when I'm
[25:44] going to amen that's what we're talking
[25:47] about Amen to take a hold of the moment
[25:49] amen and and you know one person that
[25:52] that that I believe that did that typed
[25:55] this or that did this so perfectly was
[25:57] Rahab amen and the Bible praise God we
[26:01] could we could be here all night you
[26:02] know just reading the whole the whole uh
[26:04] scriptures here amen but maybe we'll
[26:06] just read a little bit and kind of skip
[26:08] down there you can read that in Joshua
[26:09] chapter 2 in Joshua chapter 2 and it
[26:12] says and Joshua the son of nun sent out
[26:15] of shum two men to spy secretly saying
[26:18] go view the land even Jericho and they
[26:21] went and came into an harlot's house
[26:23] named Rahab and lodged there you know
[26:27] you may ask you know why is it that that
[26:29] that they ended up in a harlot's house
[26:31] you know a prostitute's house amen well
[26:33] it must have been that God LED them
[26:35] there there's no other there's no God
[26:38] LED them there amen it was for no other
[26:41] reason amen but for what we see in the
[26:43] in in the next several verses amen
[26:46] praise God and it was God that led them
[26:49] there
[26:50] amen and it says in verse two and it was
[26:53] told the king of Jericho saying behold
[26:55] there came men in hither tonight of the
[26:58] children of Israel to search out the
[27:00] country amen praise the Lord and you
[27:04] know I I kind of see the the these two
[27:06] spies uh if if you just want to kind of
[27:09] type things out I kind of see them kind
[27:10] of like the five-fold ministry amen
[27:13] right they went out amen and they
[27:15] preached amen and and and and they and
[27:18] it was this Harlot amen that received
[27:20] amen what they had to say right praise
[27:22] God but but we'll just keep reading I
[27:24] won't get ahead of myself and it says
[27:27] and in verse three and the king of
[27:29] Jericho sent unto Rahab saying bring
[27:31] forth the men that are come to thee
[27:34] which are entered into thine house for
[27:36] they becomes to search out all the
[27:39] country so it must have been that the
[27:42] king or his servants they knew Rahab
[27:46] personally because they went straight to
[27:48] their house Amen to ask if she knew
[27:50] anything about these
[27:52] men and and it's very interesting
[27:55] because her house according to to to
[27:59] history and according to the
[28:00] commentaries rahab's house was the Bible
[28:03] says that it was built on on on on top
[28:06] of the top of the wall but if you really
[28:09] in some other translations it says that
[28:11] it was built into the wall so it seems
[28:14] more you know and I saw I looked online
[28:17] and I saw some pictures of what they
[28:19] possibly think it could still be rahab's
[28:21] house standing I don't know if it is or
[28:24] not but uh it seems to make more sense
[28:28] sense that the house was built right
[28:29] into the wall or next to the wall not
[28:31] necessarily on top because the Bible
[28:34] says that she hid the spies on top of
[28:36] the roof on top of the place so it makes
[28:38] more sense it feels kind of on the side
[28:40] or at least touching against the wall
[28:42] right or part of the wall and you just
[28:45] think about that well I won't get ahead
[28:47] of myself again here think about that
[28:50] the walls
[28:52] fell and not her house my
[28:57] goodness and the woman took the two men
[29:00] and hid them and said thus there came
[29:02] man unto me so she told him half truth
[29:06] but I wish not WCE they were in other
[29:08] words she was lying she she you wouldn't
[29:11] think that it God would use this type of
[29:15] woman to do to have this kind of Faith
[29:19] Amen to to to to do what she's about to
[29:22] do because she was a harlot she she she
[29:26] um she was just one of the least persons
[29:28] that you'd think amen that that she
[29:30] would do what she was about to do but
[29:32] it's who God used Amen to do what she
[29:35] did and it came to pass about the time
[29:38] of shutting of the gate when it was dark
[29:41] verse 5 that the man went out with the
[29:44] whether the man went this is her still
[29:46] telling the king in them and whether the
[29:49] man went I what not pursue after them
[29:52] quickly for ye shall overtake them but
[29:55] she had brought them up to the roof of
[29:57] the house and hid them with the stalks
[29:59] of flax which she had laid in order upon
[30:03] the roof and the man pursued after them
[30:05] the way to Jordan unto the forge and as
[30:08] soon as they which pursued after them
[30:11] were gone out they shut the gate amen
[30:15] Rahab
[30:16] deliberately went out of her way to save
[30:20] these two
[30:23] men what what what what caused her to do
[30:26] so what struck her what was revealed to
[30:29] her amen that these two men uh uh uh
[30:32] they can help me and they can help my
[30:35] family praise
[30:37] God and you know God didn't even count
[30:39] you don't even see she just
[30:41] lied right she just lied to the king she
[30:44] just she she's a harlot she's doing all
[30:47] kinds of stuff but yet you don't find
[30:49] none of that anything everything that we
[30:50] just read in the New Testament about
[30:52] Rahab didn't speak about none of those
[30:54] things because it's all under the blood
[30:57] amen
[30:59] in verse eight and before they were laid
[31:01] down she came up unto them upon the roof
[31:04] now pay attention to this part in verse
[31:05] n and she said unto the man I know
[31:09] that's key I know that the Lord hath
[31:14] given you the land she's she's not an
[31:17] Israelite she's a Canaanite she's a
[31:20] gentile right but she says I
[31:22] know I know something just struck her
[31:26] amen just like brother Braham something
[31:27] struck he said I know something struck
[31:30] Hatty right I know amen that desire is
[31:33] in me amen praise God and said I know
[31:36] the Lord ha given you the land and that
[31:39] your terror is Fallen upon us and that
[31:42] all the inhabitants of the land faint
[31:44] because of you see they've heard they
[31:46] they heard and she tells them that they
[31:48] had heard the next verse for we have
[31:51] heard how the Lord dried up the water of
[31:54] the Red Sea for you when you came out of
[31:57] Egypt and and what ye did unto the two
[31:59] kings of the amorites that were on the
[32:01] other side of Jordan sihon and OG whom
[32:04] ye utterly destroyed she was telling
[32:07] them the word of the Lord back to them
[32:09] right the things that she had heard the
[32:11] word of God the god working in that m in
[32:13] the in the children of Israel that day
[32:16] amen she was telling them back to them
[32:18] and something amen caused her to believe
[32:20] that she wasn't there she wasn't part of
[32:23] the army of the children of Israel she
[32:25] wasn't with Moses she wasn't with Joshua
[32:27] amen but she only hearing made her
[32:30] realize this is this is the truth amen
[32:34] amen praise God this is this is true and
[32:37] when she knew that those two spies were
[32:39] part of the children of Israel she did
[32:42] everything she could Amen to get get
[32:44] them make sure that they were safe
[32:46] praise God you see how Faith amen
[32:49] spontaneous Faith amen puts you into
[32:51] action amen when you truly have faith in
[32:54] what God Amen this woman had not even
[32:56] seen the things that that that God had
[32:58] done yet she believed blessed are your
[33:02] eyes for they have they have not seen
[33:04] the things that have happened but yet
[33:05] you believed amen praise God you believe
[33:09] that the that the word of God Amen this
[33:11] word of God can do something for you
[33:12] that that God Amen can change the
[33:15] situation in your life no matter what it
[33:17] is amen and you have not even maybe
[33:19] experienced anything in your life or
[33:21] even seen the things that have happened
[33:23] in the word all you've done is just read
[33:25] them or hear them from behind the pulpit
[33:27] yet you
[33:28] believe you're blessed right amen you
[33:32] and I are blessed Saints praise God for
[33:35] we have heard how the Lord DED up the
[33:37] water of the Red Sea to you when you
[33:39] came out of Egypt and what ye did unto
[33:41] the two kings of the amorites that were
[33:43] on the other side Jordan sihon and OG
[33:46] whom you utterly destroyed you know it
[33:48] reminds me of of of the woman at the
[33:50] well when Jesus came to her and she what
[33:53] did she tell him we we know we know
[33:58] that when Messiah comes he'll tell us
[34:01] these things amen she had heard amen the
[34:04] word amen as maybe she was coming up as
[34:07] a little girl she she'd heard the word
[34:09] and and she knew that it was real she
[34:11] knew that it was truth amen and she she
[34:14] had that hope in her in her heart amen
[34:17] that it was real it was it was God
[34:18] working in in in in in in Rahab maybe
[34:21] from a little girl she she didn't want
[34:23] to be a
[34:24] harlot I mean I I don't I don't know if
[34:27] I don't know of any any Harlot that that
[34:29] would want to be a harlot she just she
[34:31] she was more concerned about her family
[34:33] she was doing it amen so that to provide
[34:36] for her family her parents her her her
[34:38] brothers amen she didn't want to do that
[34:41] what was really in her heart was God was
[34:44] something was something that that that's
[34:46] cried out about God Amen and and this
[34:48] was the opportunity that she had Amen to
[34:51] maybe experience God in her life and to
[34:54] also save her
[34:56] family verse 11 and as soon as we had
[34:59] heard these things our hearts did
[35:02] melt neither did there remain any more
[35:05] courage in any man because of you for
[35:09] the Lord your God this is her confession
[35:12] after the things she heard for the Lord
[35:14] your God he is God in heaven above and
[35:20] in Earth
[35:21] beneath man that's her confession never
[35:24] probably does didn't even know her name
[35:27] never walked with Moses never even ate
[35:30] the Mana or nothing all she did was
[35:33] heard and it struck her Amen to do
[35:36] something for those two spies those two
[35:38] men of God Amen praise the Lord I wonder
[35:41] what we do amen as the word of God is
[35:43] going forth from behind the
[35:45] pulpit what do we do amen what do we
[35:49] take claims amen of the word of God Amen
[35:51] like this woman amen when the when the
[35:54] two spies went to her amen she had
[35:56] already heard amen she knew these were
[35:58] men of God praise the Lord and she took
[36:00] advantage Amen to make sure amen that
[36:02] she treated them well she did everything
[36:04] she could amen because she wanted a
[36:06] blessing that praise the Lord amen
[36:09] amen wonder if we respect the man of God
[36:12] that way right that's right are we just
[36:15] kind of just brush him off that's just
[36:17] brother Aaron that's just brother Wade
[36:19] you
[36:20] know it's another sermon amen that they
[36:23] were preaching amen or do we truly have
[36:26] respect for the word that's going for
[36:27] because it's not the man amen if you're
[36:30] here to listen to me amen I'm I'm sorry
[36:34] amen I hope you're getting something out
[36:35] of this tonight amen praise God Amen
[36:39] that's right
[36:41] brother and so that word amen that that
[36:44] word that that that that she heard amen
[36:47] it it was real to her
[36:50] amen because you know that that woman at
[36:52] the well amen wasn't when she heard that
[36:54] word amen when that word came to the
[36:56] word amen as brother brandham says
[36:59] praise God she'd heard the word the word
[37:02] was there that brother brandham said
[37:04] that that that that representation of
[37:06] predestination was right there with her
[37:09] and when she heard the word and then the
[37:11] word came and man confirmed the thing
[37:13] what did she do she just sat right
[37:17] there like some of you all right
[37:22] now no oh she she dropped what she was
[37:25] doing she dropped her bucket she went
[37:29] she went to town and she didn't care
[37:31] amen who was going to make fun of her
[37:33] she didn't care amen if anybody anybody
[37:36] didn't believe her amen she said come
[37:39] and see a man who's told me everything
[37:41] that I've done isn't this the very
[37:44] Messiah amen praise the Lord that's what
[37:48] she did
[37:50] amen she went in there amen with full
[37:53] assurance and Faith amen that this man
[37:57] amen can help me and if he's helped me
[37:58] he can help you right and that's what
[38:01] Rahab did too amen praise God she she
[38:04] she didn't go back Amen to her Harlot
[38:06] ways she didn't go back to her amen she
[38:08] just she she went and got into action
[38:10] her faith amen put her into action Amen
[38:13] to do something for those men of
[38:15] God and she got results praise the Lord

[38:36] the Lord a true token and Rahab meant
[38:39] business with
[38:41] God and I wonder if we mean business

[40:34] message that I was trying to think of of
[40:36] earlier says I want to tell you
[40:38] something now work on that pulsation
[40:43] that spur of a moment amen like Joshua
[40:46] did like Mary Magdalene all those just
[40:49] that moment when something is revealed
[40:52] to you amen that remember faith is a
[40:55] revelation when something is revealed to
[40:57] you grab it amen seize it amen it's
[41:00] yours amen what if Rahab just wait
[41:03] waited oh those are the two spies of of
[41:06] of Israel and well I'll just go back and
[41:08] you know do my night shift tonight and
[41:11] you know would have probably missed the
[41:14] opportunity right amen but she she she
[41:18] dropped what she was doing the woman at
[41:20] the well dropped what she was doing amen
[41:21] and grabbed and seized it amen seized
[41:24] what what what the opportunity praise
[41:26] God
[41:27] like Joshua did like Mary Magdalene all
[41:30] those just that moment when something is
[41:32] revealed to you grab it hold it that
[41:34] spur of a moment amen that that that's
[41:37] key that spur of the moment amen when
[41:40] you feel like all things are possible
[41:42] how how many have ever felt that way
[41:44] praise God let let's wake up come on
[41:47] Amen let's say Amen or
[41:50] something how many have ever felt amen
[41:53] uh that way maybe even while you're
[41:55] praying amen or or you know you you get
[41:59] you get that that that that that Faith
[42:01] amen like my goodness you can go and
[42:04] definitely move a
[42:05] mountain amen praise God I I've felt
[42:09] that way before you and it's in those
[42:11] moments amen you take a hold of that
[42:13] momenten we know that all things are
[42:16] possible to them that believe amen but
[42:19] there is those times amen when
[42:21] Revelation just just is so great and it
[42:25] feels like you can just be on top of the
[42:26] world world Amen and nothing no you're
[42:29] you're unstoppable amen praise God take
[42:32] a hold of that moment just like Peter
[42:34] amen when he saw Jesus amen walking on
[42:37] water and he wasn't sure it was Jesus
[42:40] but he asked him he said Lord if it's
[42:42] you bid me to come amen if it's you Lord
[42:47] if it's you as you're praying Lord amen
[42:50] amen bid me to come amen help my faith
[42:54] help my unbelief help me to believe your
[42:56] word Lord because on my own I struggle
[42:59] but Lord bid me to come open back the
[43:01] the curtains amen and and let me see you
[43:04] clearly so that I can have faith amen
[43:06] for my children faith for my for my
[43:08] family faith for what I need amen praise
[43:12] God let me see you clear let me see your
[43:14] word clearly amen amen and and and Jesus
[43:19] didn't say anything else to him didn't
[43:20] preach the Seven Seals to them he he
[43:23] didn't he didn't go over Daniel 70 weeks
[43:25] he didn't do anything he just told him
[43:26] he said come right that's all he said
[43:30] one word amen can change can change the
[43:33] outcome of of of your of your of of
[43:36] whatever you desire just one word and
[43:38] that one word amen changed the outcome
[43:41] of that situation and all that all
[43:43] that's all Peter needed amen and out he
[43:46] went from the boat
[43:48] amen and everybody else may may be
[43:51] making fun of him all the other
[43:53] disciples what are you doing get out
[43:55] from there amen but he he he was he took
[43:57] faith of what he said he took faith of
[44:00] God's word he took faith of Jesus word
[44:03] amen one word he didn't read a whole
[44:05] chapter he didn't give them a whole
[44:06] thing amen just one word right amen and
[44:09] with that one word he walked on water
[44:12] amen what can you and I do amen with the
[44:14] whole word of God oh my and yet we have
[44:18] a hard time reading it right
[44:23] ah praise God with that one word amen
[44:27] Peter walked on water amen why because
[44:30] Peter amen took hold amen of that spur
[44:33] of the moment Faith amen Peter wasn't
[44:36] born again you got to remember that
[44:39] Peter did not have the Holy Ghost Peter
[44:42] did not all he all he was running on was
[44:44] exos of
[44:46] power
[44:48] amen remember in Matthew chapter 10 when
[44:51] Jesus gave them amen power to cast out
[44:53] Devils heal the SI the sick and all even
[44:56] to preach the gopel gopel that was all
[44:58] just exosa but it wasn't dunamus power
[45:01] yet with just that power he was able to
[45:03] walk with water how what can you and I
[45:06] do with dunamus power Amen in our souls
[45:08] with the power amen with the Holy Ghost
[45:10] in your soul what can you and I do amen
[45:13] tonight praise God your children amen
[45:15] will come to the Lord amen with that
[45:17] kind of Faith amen praise God your
[45:19] family amen your your body will be
[45:21] healed amen with that kind of Faith
[45:23] praise God Amen where nothing amen I
[45:26] don't care what the doctors say Amen you
[45:28] I respect what they said I I that's fine
[45:31] amen but something else struck me amen
[45:34] something else strikes me and says that
[45:35] that can't be so amen because faith is
[45:38] declaring something else hallelujah amen
[45:41] Revelation tells you otherwise right
[45:44] praise God verse 13 amen let's move a
[45:47] little quicker and that and that you
[45:48] will save alive my father so see here
[45:50] here's Rahab she's asking asking them
[45:53] you will save a lot my father and my
[45:55] mother and my brethren and my sister
[45:57] and all that they have and deliver our
[45:59] lives from death and the man answered
[46:01] her our life for yours if you tell other
[46:04] people our business in other words and
[46:07] it shall be when the Lord hath given us
[46:09] the land that we will deal kindly and
[46:11] truly with thee then he then she let
[46:13] them down by cord through the window for
[46:16] her house was upon the town wall was
[46:19] upon the town wall that's what I was
[46:20] there speaking about in other in other
[46:23] versions of the of the Bible it says
[46:25] within the wall and she dwelt upon the
[46:28] wall amen so there we see rahab's faith
[46:31] in action again amen they told her you
[46:35] you tell other people about what we're
[46:36] doing amen you tell other people amen
[46:39] then you know our lives for yours you
[46:42] see but she said I promise I won't do
[46:44] anything and she immediately went into
[46:46] action continued her action continued
[46:48] her faith praise God and let them spies
[46:51] upon down the wall and the man said unto
[46:54] her we will be blameless of this thine
[46:56] oath which thou has made us swear behold
[46:59] when we come into the land so he's
[47:01] telling them she they're telling her
[47:03] that when when we come into the land
[47:06] Thou shalt bind this line of scarlet
[47:08] thread in the window which thou didst
[47:11] let us down by and thou shalt bring thy
[47:14] father and thy mother and thy Brethren
[47:16] and all thy father's household home unto
[47:18] thee and it shall be that whatsoever
[47:20] shall go out of the doors of the house
[47:22] into the street his blood shall be upon
[47:25] his head and we will be guilt L of and
[47:27] whosoever shall be with thee in the
[47:29] house his blood shall be on our head if
[47:32] any hand be upon him and if you utter
[47:35] this our business then we will we will
[47:38] we will be quit of thine oath which thou
[47:41] has made us to swear now watch verse 21
[47:44] and she
[47:45] said amen according to your words so be
[47:49] it amen what does that sound
[47:52] like Amen to me it sounds like a a woman
[47:56] laid later on Amen hundreds of years ago
[47:59] which she was part of that lineage amen
[48:02] where Christ came from amen said the
[48:05] exact same
[48:06] thing thousands of years later when the
[48:09] angel when the angel Gabriel came unto
[48:11] Mary and said you're going to have a
[48:13] child and he said how can this be I
[48:15] don't not a man and he said the Holy
[48:17] Ghost shall overshadow you amen and and
[48:19] that that which is in you amen is of God
[48:21] Amen and all she was said okay be it
[48:24] unto me according to your word I don't
[48:27] know how it's going to happen I don't
[48:28] know what the Rahab was not going to be
[48:31] able to explain all the different how
[48:33] the walls were going to fall or how they
[48:35] were going to seize the the the the city
[48:39] she just went ahead and did what these
[48:41] spies told her to do and she said
[48:44] according unto your word so be it and
[48:47] she sent them away and they departed and
[48:50] watch what she does next and she bound
[48:52] the Scarlet line in the window but if
[48:55] you notice in verse 8 18 they told her
[48:58] the two spies told her when we come into
[49:00] the land Thou shalt bind the line of
[49:02] scarlet thread in the window in other
[49:05] words when they come and take over no
[49:07] she didn't wait till then she did it
[49:09] right there and then right and she bound
[49:12] the Scarlet line in the window in other

[50:53] month to come to the Lord right that's
[50:56] right I don't either just come to the
[50:59] Lord now amen and and if you truly have
[51:02] that desire and you truly experience God
[51:05] that deep down settled faith in God's
[51:07] word amen that God what God did in
[51:10] rahab's life and and what God did in
[51:12] that woman at the Well's life amen if
[51:14] that really happens in your life it'll
[51:16] put it'll take care of everything
[51:19] else slowly but surely amen things will
[51:22] start falling off of your life that wow
[51:26] that was
[51:27] I don't really have a desire for that
[51:30] anymore I couldn't give up rap music I I
[51:33] couldn't give up country music I can't
[51:35] give up this this all this all this
[51:38] music amen I couldn't give all this up
[51:40] amen but now as I'm in the word more is
[51:44] I'm as I'm really paying attention to
[51:46] God's word as I'm feeding on the word
[51:49] and the word is washing me at the same
[51:51] time now I'm able to give these things
[51:54] up amen no Pastor told you to give it up
[51:57] your mom and dad never told you to give
[51:59] it up amen the word of God did it that's
[52:01] right that's when it's a true conversion
[52:04] then amen praise God Amen this woman
[52:09] didn't wait amen Rahab didn't wait until
[52:11] oh when the children of Israel come and
[52:14] and they take over the land I'll I'll go
[52:15] ahead and tie the the the the Scarlet
[52:18] thread to the window no she did it right
[52:20] there in then as soon as those spies
[52:21] left amen because she knew what she
[52:24] wanted she believed amen what she saw
[52:27] amen was true amen and that God the god
[52:30] of Israel was was the true God Of Heaven
[52:32] and Earth as she declared amen praise
[52:37] God Amen so see works is Faith
[52:41] expressed amen and so that's why it's so
[52:45] important and I say this to all of you
[52:48] but to our young people that's why it's
[52:50] so important for confessing with the
[52:52] mouth and
[52:54] believing amen Romans 10 8 says this it
[52:58] says but what sath it the word is n thee
[53:01] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[53:05] is the word of faith which we preach
[53:08] which we preach that if verse n that if
[53:12] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth so if
[53:16] you if you were if you were if this
[53:17] verse just meant for you to confess with
[53:19] your mind it would have said your mind
[53:22] amen it's not sufficient with your mind
[53:25] it says if Thou shalt confess with thy
[53:28] mouth and your mouth is not here your
[53:30] mouth is here if you confess with your
[53:33] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[53:37] in thine heart that's the part that is
[53:40] eternal amen I believe I declare amen
[53:44] what did Rahab do it was a it was an
[53:45] outward confession of the faith that she
[53:48] received it was an expression outwardly
[53:51] amen other people need to see amen what
[53:53] you believe amen they need to hear amen
[53:56] I believe that God Amen the Son of God
[53:59] Jesus Christ died for me raised from the
[54:01] dead Amen on the third day and I believe
[54:03] that he can come back amen if I repent
[54:06] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[54:07] Jesus Christ he'll promise me he'll give
[54:09] me the Holy Ghost amen if that's your
[54:11] confession amen praise God you'll
[54:13] receive that amen if you believe that in
[54:15] your heart that's right amen praise God
[54:19] but if it's just mental knowledge
[54:21] because you know the verse and you see
[54:24] when I was when I was young when I was
[54:25] in the bap Church they would always
[54:28] confess they would always read this
[54:29] verse and I knew it by
[54:32] heart and I knew it and and but I never
[54:36] did it there's one thing knowing the
[54:38] Bible and knowing quotes knowing them in
[54:41] your head and they're there that doesn't
[54:43] save you that just gives you some fake
[54:46] Assurance
[54:48] right don't don't misunderstand me
[54:50] because some people walk in this message
[54:52] with fake Assurance just because they
[54:54] know some quotes or some Bible versus
[54:57] amen you've got to know God for yourself
[54:59] amen you've got to confess with your
[55:02] mouth amen you've got to put that faith
[55:04] into action and when something Sparks in
[55:07] you amen that preacher up there
[55:09] preaching and amen snorting and slobbing
[55:11] all over the place so that I can repent
[55:14] amen and something grabs a hold of you
[55:16] you better take hold of that amen do it
[55:20] right there and then amen put that
[55:21] thread over the window right there and
[55:23] then don't wait till next year right
[55:26] next year might be too late you're not
[55:29] promised next year
[55:31] amen praise
[55:34] God how many of those people that passed
[55:36] away up that died we pray for those
[55:40] people that just died in that hurricane
[55:41] in Tennessee and Western North Carolina
[55:43] how many of those were young
[55:45] people I don't know I'm sure there was
[55:49] and they never thought that they would
[55:51] be washed down down a River floating
[55:55] their bodies floating
[55:57] and maybe some of them had the
[55:58] opportunity to get things right with God
[56:02] and that was their their opportunity and
[56:04] maybe they failed I don't know I'm not
[56:06] saying this to scare you I'm just saying
[56:08] this the Bible says today is the day of
[56:12] salvation not in 2025 not in
[56:16] 2026 amen today the Bible says is the
[56:19] day of
[56:20] salvation that if Thou shalt confess
[56:22] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and thou
[56:24] shalt believe in thine heart that God ha
[56:26] raised him from the dead what does the
[56:28] Bible say it says something so positive
[56:31] and so sure it says Thou shalt be
[56:34] saved that is is as simple as that you
[56:38] will be saved there's nothing nothing
[56:41] there's no question about it it's how
[56:44] it's how it's How ass sure Paul says
[56:47] this here for with the heart man
[56:49] believeth unto righteousness and with
[56:52] the mouth what and with the mouth
[56:55] confession is made unto
[56:58] salvation amen young people you better
[57:01] know that you have God not just because
[57:03] you come to this church or because
[57:05] you're you're you know you had a family
[57:07] member who was the pastor here or or or
[57:09] or or whatever man you've got to know
[57:12] that you know
[57:13] God Amen praise God you cannot go in
[57:17] under Mom and Dad's coattails and you
[57:19] cannot go under the pastor coattails or
[57:22] nothing amen you've got to know God for
[57:24] yourself amen like Rahab did that's
[57:26] right you've seen so much Rahab didn't
[57:28] see no but she just heard that's all she
[57:30] did you've seen a lot more you have no
[57:33] excuse Rahab has more excuse than you do
[57:36] praise
[57:39] God I'm sorry if I'll be a little hard
[57:41] but amen the Bible says compel them to
[57:45] come that's right it doesn't say oh come
[57:49] on come on the Lord can save
[57:53] you come on please please birdie please
[57:58] come to church
[57:59] no God I believe if we were doing that
[58:03] old fashion preaching like they were
[58:05] doing back then 30 40 50 years ago you
[58:08] probably see more people amen respecting
[58:10] the house of
[58:11] God Amen but people don't respect the
[58:14] house of God anymore because they they
[58:16] they they just come to they think that
[58:18] they've come to hear some intellectual
[58:19] thing some you know somebody just come
[58:22] Pat them in the back and not talk about
[58:24] their their house and how they should
[58:26] should be living and and stuff like that
[58:28] but when you get into people's uh into
[58:30] people's lives amen that's when they I'm
[58:33] not talking about you brother boy I'm
[58:34] just I'm I wasn't here I'll go up with
[58:36] the rhy brother rhy you know when you
[58:39] get into people's lives you know but the
[58:42] Bible says compel them to come right
[58:45] right praise God now I'm not talking
[58:47] about people's personal situations or
[58:49] anything like that you know don't get
[58:51] misunderstanding but when things get
[58:54] down to your level amen that's when it
[58:56] compels you otherwise it doesn't compel
[58:59] you right
[59:01] amen when it gets down to your level
[59:04] then it compels you when it doesn't you
[59:07] just brush it off on someone else oh
[59:08] that's brother so and so he he's the one
[59:10] who watches TV all the time and stuff
[59:12] like that and he's the one who's always
[59:14] on Tik Tock and and no but when it gets
[59:17] down to your
[59:19] level then it's different then but
[59:22] that's where we don't like it
[59:26] just preach me about the Seven
[59:28] Seals but they not touch my life tell me
[59:31] all about those things but not touch my
[59:34] life we need to have our lives touched
[59:37] am we need to have our lives touched
[59:41] amen praise
[59:44] God and so and so and just to finish up
[59:48] amen I'll just finish up with this I
[59:49] have a lot a little bit more
[59:53] but when Rahab did this saying Saints
[59:57] her faith acted upon this amen that's
[1:00:01] right her faith caused her to act the
[1:00:02] way she did to act strange what a
[1:00:06] strange thing to put and tie a thread
[1:00:09] over over a window nobody else was doing
[1:00:12] it in
[1:00:13] Jericho but the the the fivefold
[1:00:16] ministry of that day said amen they were
[1:00:19] inspired to tell her
[1:00:21] that amen who if it was God that led
[1:00:23] them there then it must have been God to
[1:00:25] tell her Amen to put that there right
[1:00:28] amen inspired to tell her that and she
[1:00:31] she just didn't waste any time she just
[1:00:33] did it amen can we take the word of God
[1:00:36] Amen of the preachers amen that preach
[1:00:38] by that
[1:00:39] way amen problem is we lack respect and
[1:00:42] we don't we don't respect what what the
[1:00:44] we don't respect amen the the authority
[1:00:47] of the ministry we don't respect it and
[1:00:48] that's why you don't get a blessing out
[1:00:50] of it amen praise God so she that's what
[1:00:53] she did and she and and because she did
[1:00:56] this amen the Bible says that her family
[1:01:00] Joshua herself Joshua himself the Holy
[1:01:03] Ghost remember he's the he's the type of
[1:01:06] the Holy Spirit Jesus himself Amen in in
[1:01:09] in chapter three I believe it is he made
[1:01:11] sure to
[1:01:13] oversee that she came she was she was
[1:01:16] she was saved amen that's right he said
[1:01:19] he stopped in the middle of the battle
[1:01:20] after the walls fell down amen he
[1:01:23] stopped in the middle of the chaos and
[1:01:25] he said said to the two spies you go
[1:01:27] make sure that Rahab is
[1:01:30] okay and in the middle of all the chaos
[1:01:33] and probably people running around and
[1:01:35] and and and and dirt flying all over the
[1:01:38] place and everything and maybe fire and
[1:01:40] all kinds of thing people dying animals
[1:01:43] dying in the middle of all that chaos
[1:01:45] Joshua stops and says make sure that
[1:01:47] Rahab is okay amen oh God in the middle
[1:01:51] of the chaos amen of of the of what your
[1:01:54] problem is or no matter what's going on
[1:01:56] in your life amen if you've got faith in
[1:01:58] this word amen God is going to make sure
[1:02:00] amen that he saves and answers your
[1:02:03] request amen praise God you did your
[1:02:05] part I'm going to do mine amen praise
[1:02:09] God God makes sure that he did that for
[1:02:12] for Rahab praise the Lorden why because
[1:02:15] she had faith in something that she just
[1:02:18] heard amen everybody else was closing
[1:02:21] the Bible says that everybody else
[1:02:23] closed the doors of the walls the amen
[1:02:26] they would have been better to just let
[1:02:28] the Israelites come
[1:02:29] in come on in you are the people of God
[1:02:33] we just like nin amen and they accepted
[1:02:36] the the message and they believed they
[1:02:38] would have been better off just allowing
[1:02:39] the people of God to come in and
[1:02:41] probably God would have spared them
[1:02:43] right but not but they didn't do what
[1:02:46] Rahab did Rahab these are these are our
[1:02:49] enemies but yet I'm going to let them in
[1:02:52] my house I have no other choice amen
[1:02:55] this is the the only way I have to to be
[1:02:57] saved and my family to be saved amen
[1:03:00] something
[1:03:01] ridiculous that she did but it caused
[1:03:04] her to be
[1:03:05] saved amen and sometimes you might have
[1:03:07] to do something ridiculous amen boohoo
[1:03:10] and cry amen at the altar or or or or
[1:03:14] pray to God all night long and stay in
[1:03:16] his word amen but that ridiculous will
[1:03:18] bring a life in your in your life amen
[1:03:21] we bring something real praise the
[1:03:24] Lord amen praise praise
[1:03:27] God Amen so and so going back to Hebrews
[1:03:30] 11:30 says by faith the walls of Jericho
[1:03:33] fell down after they were compassed
[1:03:36] about seven days by faith the Harlot
[1:03:39] Rahab perished not with them that
[1:03:41] believed not when she had received
[1:03:43] despies with peace can you imagine that
[1:03:45] her house being right there within the
[1:03:48] walls and all the walls crumble but her
[1:03:50] house
[1:03:51] stays right that's got to be God right
[1:03:56] amen that was God God respected her
[1:03:59] faith amen because her faith seized the
[1:04:03] moment amen likewise J James likewise
[1:04:07] also was not Rahab the Harlot justified
[1:04:09] by works you see she it put her into
[1:04:12] action and that's what Justified her
[1:04:14] when she had received the messengers and
[1:04:17] had sent them out another way amen
[1:04:22] praise the Lord Jesus and so brother B
[1:04:25] says this about uh we'll be finishing up
[1:04:27] here in just a moment he had he had a
[1:04:30] Time amen remember when when remember
[1:04:32] the story when brother brandham the Lord
[1:04:34] told Brother brandom as he was praying
[1:04:36] he went into the closet and he was
[1:04:38] inspired so much by the story of Joseph
[1:04:41] and Joseph and he went into the closet
[1:04:43] and he said Lord I just thank you for a
[1:04:46] man like Joseph Joseph in the Bible uh
[1:04:49] you know in in the Old Testament he said
[1:04:51] I thank you for a man like Joseph you
[1:04:53] know and I thank you for his life that
[1:04:54] even though he was he suffered and was
[1:04:57] accused wrongly and and all this he
[1:04:59] couldn't help to have visions and to
[1:05:01] have dreams and these things but I thank
[1:05:03] you for a man like that that stood firm
[1:05:06] amen and as brother Brandon was praying
[1:05:08] you can go back and read it and the
[1:05:09] message Faith Works as Faith Express he
[1:05:12] says his brother Brandon was praying and
[1:05:13] something told him the Lord told him he
[1:05:15] said he said you're going to have a son
[1:05:17] named Joseph that's right and so he went
[1:05:20] all across the country telling the
[1:05:21] people that he was going to have a son
[1:05:23] named Joseph amen and
[1:05:26] and for years amen he was saying he
[1:05:28] didn't know when it was
[1:05:29] coming or nothing and so here are some
[1:05:32] of the things that brother Brandon went
[1:05:34] through in order to get to that point
[1:05:37] amen right when the Lord showed brother
[1:05:39] Brandon that his son Joseph was coming
[1:05:41] brother Brandon was made fun of because
[1:05:44] Sarah was born in between that time
[1:05:46] frame Sarah his his his his his middle
[1:05:49] daughter and so they started making fun
[1:05:51] of brother Brandon and he said what you
[1:05:53] meant was
[1:05:54] Josephine was was Josephine that was
[1:05:56] coming not Joseph and so he had to
[1:05:59] receive that
[1:06:00] ridicule doctors said to Sister ma that
[1:06:03] she couldn't have any more babies after
[1:06:06] after Sarah was born right he was called
[1:06:08] a false prophet because Sarah was born
[1:06:12] but Joseph was not there yet yet he was
[1:06:14] still proclaiming and and and and
[1:06:16] claiming that God Amen God had showed
[1:06:18] him that he was going to have a son
[1:06:19] named Joseph amen he was called a false
[1:06:23] prophet false rumors were spread around
[1:06:25] the Nation about him and his wife he
[1:06:28] talks about it in this message you go
[1:06:30] back and read it right and during her
[1:06:32] pregnancy with Joseph sister ma was
[1:06:35] wasn't guaranteed to live she almost
[1:06:38] died right and so brother brandham says
[1:06:40] this in the message and she said talking
[1:06:43] about meting and she said Bill do you
[1:06:45] think I'm going to die and I said I
[1:06:48] don't know but the baby is going to be
[1:06:50] born
[1:06:52] anyhow right you see that faith that
[1:06:55] that that's the faith that Rahab had
[1:06:58] amen I don't know what's going to happen
[1:07:00] but I'm going to go ahead and just tie
[1:07:02] that Scarlet that Scarlet that token
[1:07:05] amen down down that window I don't know
[1:07:08] but the baby is going to be born anyhow
[1:07:09] you're going to have Joseph right she
[1:07:12] said is this
[1:07:13] Him Sister ma asking him I said I don't
[1:07:17] know honey I can't say but God said he's
[1:07:20] going to have Joseph and we're going to
[1:07:22] have Joseph you see that positive
[1:07:25] confession amen whatever it is in your
[1:07:28] life amen just keep claiming it Joseph
[1:07:30] wasn't there amen your healing may not
[1:07:32] be there amen the salvation of your
[1:07:34] children may not be there just keep
[1:07:36] claiming it amen I don't care what
[1:07:39] anything says he says we're going to
[1:07:41] have Joseph for the same God that's told
[1:07:43] me all these Revelations told me that he
[1:07:47] never failed on others and he won't fail
[1:07:49] on that am amen and we know Joseph came
[1:07:53] on the scene that's right praise
[1:07:57] God and it was because brother brandham
[1:07:59] stood firmer amen everybody ridiculing
[1:08:02] him everybody making fun of him his wife
[1:08:05] almost dying doctors telling him your
[1:08:07] wife can't have any more children let
[1:08:08] let me tie her tubes and he said you
[1:08:10] better not he said you you better not
[1:08:14] and and all this coming against him amen
[1:08:17] he he says he said Joseph welcome that's
[1:08:20] what he says in the message amen so can
