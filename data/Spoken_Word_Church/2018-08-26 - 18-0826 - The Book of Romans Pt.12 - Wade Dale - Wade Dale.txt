TRANSCRIPT
========================================
go ahead to edit everything but not me last Sunday y'all will let me leave it running and it ran the whole service let me know it well I usually have support that helps me and yes exactly my right hand folks weren't here I want to introduce your fav you not met brother Russ dunker they said brother Russ doctor he's from Minnesota he's here with us for the weekend and greet you in the name of the Lord and we're going to get started so he watches online so he probably knows most of the anyway so he he's uh he's not a stranger he's just one of those oh and good night so gathering together unto Him I think we're gettin together I really do go in the book of Romans don't you me they'd have been here you know that you win chapter 8 which is a very beautiful chapter chapter 8 if we like last Sunday we went back to chapter 7 because remember chapters in the Bible were put in by man Paul was just writing a letter he just continually wrote a letter man put the verses in and man put two chapters in so watch what he says in 24 Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this dead now remember let me back up for a minute I find that along with when I would do good evil is present with me now here we go to the compartmentalizing of of what he's talking about Paul is not talking about he's lost so Paul of soul is redeemed born-again eternal as God is it is done can't sin can't make an error cannot be evil cannot be wrong never had a bad thought eternal right because he's born he's a born-again believer so he's eternal so what's he talking about I find that a law that when I do good evil is present with me now let's go over to the flesh it's not the flesh the flesh just a product the product of sin but you don't sin with your flesh you sell hope yeah you did but it's motivated by what that middleman is and if you're not born again you're motivated by the soul which is evil so Paul is not saying evil is prevalent but if you and I will agree 100 percent of us will agree that in our spirit realm before Satan yes pound on God's in the soul is eternal they can't touch you but he can touch that spirit man because Paul can't say evil is present with me and be talking about his soul no he's talking about the second round of memory reasoning conscious affection imagination those five things are our problem right so if you're born again your soul that's problem it's old God your body is just holding everything together it came because the product of mom and daddy getting together producing the flesh no next Sunday we'll read in for steel for brother Ram talks about how it should have been had they not been a fall we would not have come with a with a sex act we would have come by Spoken work right God would have spoken God what spoke to Adam come see us the way it does God spoke to Moses most spoke Aaron and give it to the people that's just the way it is right same way within the Garden of Eden God spoke to Apple Adam had the thought Adam with God on the earth and he was to produce all of the board all the people that are now born again this was before the fall so that's the way we would have come but we didn't call it income this way no I said in his room did we all came born in sin saying iniquity as popular money woman coming earth : - the pollens not a liar and that he's this man's a prophet and he's writing the Bible so he's not saying that evil is present in me as far as in my soul no he's a born-again believer leave that thing along because then you know really back in here we we went through all this for now I know that in me that is in my flesh not the flash because remember your flesh does not sin nope he's less tense in your flesh manifests what sin is inside of you right I mean I'll explain it one more time you say what an honest and with my flash Jesus walked up to the Pharisees and the Pharisees said we've never touched a woman we don't commit adultery you can't accuse us committee go because I never touched or had an affair in my flesh Jesus said that's alright but I say unto thee if you look on a woman memory of reason comes it's facing the imagination you look on a woman you've already committed adultery in your heart so it ain't kind of to do with that we bet people have been beating on the flesh and this message for years and that just a waste of time a waste of time this you can't get the person born again and then get that spirit lined up with the size of a perfect man listen even Jesus's flesh was dying he was Almighty God in human flesh and that human flesh was dying he had to take a bath he had to go to the bathroom he was ever more human but that soul and the spirit inside that man was Almighty God he was born around way he was born spoken word commended for I know that in me that is in my flesh not my flesh dwelleth no good thing for the will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not you talking about the soul no he's talking about let the soul live because he always goes through and says it's not how that liveth Christ it lived in me because watch this wholesome if you take this right here and you stop at the end of chapter 7 we're all off there's no way I mean not lost in the soul I'm no math you know your spirit will never be under suggestion okay good luck for the good that I would I do not for the good of one for the souls for the good that I would do I don't do why but the evil which I would not that I do that middle man now if I do that I wouldn't I it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me now he's not talking about in his soul he's talking about his middle man the memory reason convicts imagination I find it all then when I would do good evil is present with me Brian delight in the law of God after what n-word man he goes all the way inside to the soul but I see another law come back he's gonna come back out and live with human life he's gonna have a human spirit another law in my members warring against the law of my mind bring him and the captivity to the law sin which is in my members no wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from the body of this death question mark I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law sin Paul like brother Rev Sekou he goes out on a limb he says ah but there is therefore now no condemnation now he was condemning himself the whole chapter 7 the middle man he was condemning today he was condemning itself there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ middle man inside me has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh do's and don'ts God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh and I want to read this in - and the Greek because it's really really neat to to listen to this so we'll go back to verse 1 there is then no condemnation now - those are India who are in the anointed Jesus for the law of the spirit of life by the anointed Jesus liberated me from the law of sin death this is the actual letter that was written this is the King James Version that they Frank to make you understand a little bit better but I'm reading from the Greek dialogue which is the original written straight off of what Paul wrote okay Joel the witness has a fight you can't okay but it's the it's a die glut and I got the bigger one there's a small one this is the big one so okay I can read okay so now verse two what for the law of the spirit of life by the anointed Jesus liberated me from the law sin and death verse 3 for what was impossible for the law and then it was wheat to the flesh why was the law impossible why why was the law the ultimate because it only covered your sin if it only covered your stance what we'll talk about last night if it only covers your sin you got to come out of that somewhere and it's old thirty because the life of the animal couldn't come back into the person to eradicate or clean that soul but when Jesus died he was able to come back because he was eternal that eternal life to come back into the believer wash him away and there's now for now knows everyone now no condemnation but your sins in the Sea of God's forget one it's never be remembered again for what the law could not do for what was impossible for the law in that it was weak to the flesh God having sent his own son in a form of the flesh of sin even parentheses by offering for sin condense them in and then condemned sin in the flesh so he's condemned sin in the flesh there's therefore now become I realize that I don't want to read you the Greek in force over for for so the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled by us who are walking not according to flesh but according to spirit all right that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled because remember Jesus didn't do away with the law he made an honor well we're the only ones that can live the law we're the only ones that can can not you know we don't live the ten suggestion we live in Commandments you know though most of the worldly up to ten suggestions they said yes thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal you covet your neighbor haul it up stuff you know they just suggestion but do we live in flesh no we don't live in the flesh you know what this program you come up here to brotherly kindness when the brother Dale will get to it he's talking about you know having brotherly kindness then he talks about not physically killing a brother but spiritually killing him or talking about him or saying something bad about him anyone cured you kill his spirit he said you've killed that person alright so you don't physically kill anybody now you don't have to you can kill them in the spirit realm killer influence because if you kill influence you kill the person but what for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh that listen you know what we do we mind the things of the flesh because we live in the flesh we rather than a wild worm father were kind word whatever title you want to say let it after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh for their the spirit after the things of the spirit that's where you have to get your balance for those who live according to flesh are minding the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit the things of the spirit now watch for the fortress for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now one's carnal mind carnal mind is what enmity to God so there was no way that God's going to contact you now he's got to go through your mind but the problem is even was in this force field man was so carnally minded until they took on doctrines that are not a God let didn't come from God it came from a carnal mind all right which carnal is what earthly fleshly all right as for down here for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace let me read to this for the mind of the flesh is death but the mind of the Spirit is life in peace because the mind of the flesh is enmity to God for the law of God it is not subject nor indeed can it be because the carnal mind is enmity against God it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God you said well we can and you know what though we can't please God in the flesh that's why everybody's trying to say well long hair long dress don't paint your face but but live like you know be black inside you know the soul would be rotting and they just live it because so-and-so said it and because someone so said it because you know because we got it preached to it for about ten or fifteen years and it really doesn't do any good you have your hair dragging the ground and still dying old hell that's right so so then that there in the flesh cannot please God but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit look yes big word right there yes because what Paul says but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit yeah that spirit is in you if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ is enough in other words you know the God unless you're born again in yourself right and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but why we worried about the body for all these years forget the body until we come to a body change it's just going to keep getting over and over and over but the soul inside is eternal we just need to let that person out start working out start working their way out through our memories and concerts effects and imagination because remember God contacts you through those things I mean I sat down this morning and worked on the sermon but it was a sermon of what I've been thinking about all week so in my mind I was thinking about what I was thinking about back on Monday fuse means Thursday Friday right so you have to use your mind but now that mind also can be carnal and some big old bad often has come into the week to all so anyway just God in there you know the devil comes in and goes yeah yeah wait for them big words only you know that you don't use any more than you so why bother yeah they don't bother you the devil's already got you come on we were in a youth camp one time when I firmly told some of you Big Brother dating steamin was preaching and that was probably 600 people never to lose he he said I own all the preachers in here there was about 25 of us to stand up so we all stood up all the kids look he said I wanna ask y'all how many of you have had a bad thought today they don't raise the name they said how many of you have had a bad thought while you were preaching we all raised our then and the kids are going he said how many of you had a bat doll I used praying for somebody we all raised their hand so you know that kind of give the when his point was is that we're not don't put us up here don't put them don't put the ministry the only difference between me and you is it does give me a gift to say something that you might be able to understand other than that then didn't and you know I'm just as much of them it's gonna take my graces then you be a pleasure Satan actually jumps on me a lot of times before he does you know cuz I'm trying to study for a sermon and all heck breaks loose in your brain you know don't have to it can be common everything around you in Louise you don't know we all know that if you don't know that by now then really there's something wrong with you but you have to believe though compartmentalize it because that didn't come from your soul now when I was a sinner I knew where that came from because that's what controlled me I let it control me yes same way with Paul when Paul was condemning Christians and causing them to blaspheme and putting them to death God wasn't in Paul's so you'd say whatever you want to you bribe can't persecute bride so Paul was under the assumption though if he was religious it's that's why Paul can say what he did in Romans said he knew what he did he who will through that he knew he was a sinner he knew that he put people to death they had what he had now he didn't he didn't have a bad thing but now he also knew that he paid I got a conversion but he didn't convert the whole man right it didn't convert the whole man what's pretty honey in there I took this big picture when I did that's actually my honey I'll cook picked it up for the picture so Paul is the best one it can write what do you were I believe God couldn't use nobody else so you use the man that that even think about for an eyes when we know I told him city Paul's coming to see you you pray for it how about if I was like a Bible and I said Lord you is this the same saw that we're running from that we're hiding from the Lord says you know I'm a really damn because the Lord said and nice calm down calm down you need to pray for him yeah you see so even Paul had to come see somebody in the head like to get like to get the Holy Ghost but once he did see once he did now he's going hey we still got work today we still got work today even Peter Peter said you know being born again that's what this whole thing is it's not that you getting born again in your soul over and over and over again your birthday these virtues into you yes right and that's helping take the middle man the spirit man and turn it in to what the inside that's what this statue a purple man's for you it's to turn that middleman forget about the flesh please forget about the flesh all the flesh made me the flesh didn't make you do anything like I said many times before you get somebody that's he's in the contract and he's you know from his spine down he can't live his money so he can't commit adultery can't do all these things that a sinner drink Smok custom but if he'd only said Jesus Christ in his soul doesn't matter one's body does okay so let's let's quit beating the flesh like we've done for years let's get inside that man and make him squirm now the problem is is we've made the flesh squirm for 20 years 30 years 40 years since the probably little you know beats flesh not listen yes beat the flesh we get this flash don't forget it for we are not in the flesh women let's go to verse 8 so then they are the end the flesh and the flesh cannot please God you know why we can't please God in the flesh not the flesh but the motivator because remember I told you before every time we have a bad dog that's not from God so that's not God right we're not pleasing God by them thought we're not pleasing God by living a human life it was supposed to be we weren't supposed to have to eat we weren't supposed to have to have a septic tank we were not supposed to be married the way we're married so that's all the carnal part that we do but you know what is you compartmental that said Louie sell something you think you come apartment but if you look compartmentalize it that way and say look the things that I have to do as a human being is right here I'm a human I'm in the first three dimensions I got trapped into doing this it was my mom and daddy's fault but God had us in the flesh because Adam and Eve sinned in the flesh see when you see serpents Eden I guess the sex act against the whole thing all the way down then you take it to the spiritual part and that's what we're looking at that right because we keep we're all born between Satan the knee because we were all born on the same site so just get over that okay get over that there's only one person that wasn't and he's the one that we're looking for and when he changes this back he's going to change us not throw this one away and brand another way he's actually sure sure sure absolutely the grapes like we were coming out last night foolish bird can come water my name being good all these different things they'll be given eternal life where if it just comes the way it was supposed to come only God's children would have been born they would have been nothing else but see to make the fullness of God manifest you had to be up here to be a redeemer a healer Savior I'm glad I came lost don't tell me you know a lot of people to mention say well I'm glad I came here with eternal life while you did I'm just gonna tell you you didn't you can say what you want do you did not come here with eternal life now we're to reach it yeah I've heard of myself preaching because of that seed thing well there's only one Steve mister word and wherever it followed me all my life the one man me it followed me yeah it followed me all my life and then one day I connected the one God knew I would want so I connected to and guess what it came from off the page into here the seed was laying there and you can say the seed was laying there but there was no light listen like Paul how could Paul persecute the very Christians that he was going to be if he had anything eternal in his in his song and it's just like me and Jim we're talking another day there's no way that we come any different than Judas Iscariot because you know what Judas Iscariot can walk up to the dead judgment and say now you told Bob black that he had this eternal scene in him and he always would be curling that means you think you mentioned and he would be what God would be just to give you to security kind of life because he came some way different than he did but no no everybody come off everybody was born sinners I don't care who you are so you don't want that covers and all and then when they come up to the dead judge but you just could say I did it it's my fault you can't say well but a mob hit or he made it and you even send a problem in that told him and he had this eternal dream and he was gonna make it all the way didn't matter what no that ain't what promising that would be car pulling in 30 min making you do something today so now he ain't that way no he knew you'd want it had it there for you and that's it I got a book preach and we gotta get back to sinus immediately well okay you're back son good plan but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if you can't be in the spirit if you don't have God willed that spirit dwelling in you now you can have an anointing the true anointing of God you can have the true learning and be false I believe in like we said before even now not a denies the Christian but and that's the high priest that put Jesus on the cross God still honored your thought about that God still honored when he took that blood behind the mercy seat I mean he killed Jesus Christ or he you know you he wanted he did call him belzebub but because he was a hot breeze when he took the blood back if I start out to kill him while he was in there but he could because his life do you want to man his life was under the law blameless and asking that one mark they couldn't be one mark that's why they came down through in that priesthood there was no mark against him but the very thing and that's what we're gonna talk about this afternoon he was spiritually dead he was black there was nothing to him immediately he was he with God you are God knew before the foundation world and he would never what he said Jesus Christ beyond that so I had to me that's very simple yeah but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none event that's pretty simple and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin now I'm dead know it don't hold the bear like it before it doesn't same hand same mouth it used the curse he just cleans it up same way what he's gonna do with the earth like we've come about last night heaven and earth will pass away it took a prophet tell us that that main explosion and doing away and God create he thought will create another earth but the Bible says I created a new heaven and new earth they took a prophet to tell us though that that part create was what for just like you you and I are not gonna be we're not gonna throw this body away right and pick up a new one no work that would be real easy that'd be really easy but soccer party is this for Satan to see you do what you do walk the world in the world of Sam but God transform your body one day change our body you mean it'll be like his glorious body right it's a spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken oh I'm sorry didn't read ten and Christ me in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness see that's what we've got to understand even Paul was telling us that we are running just by what's inside of us not watching this thing you know Jesus ended this talk about the washing of the talks well what is this this is clay this is the pot you can sit and watch this thing every day still gonna die one day if we don't go think record I mean take a bunch of knee and cross beating you the body indeed is dead as to sin but the spirit of life as to righteousness verse 11 in the Greek and if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you he who raised Christ from the dead will also make alive your mortal bodies through the indwelling of his spirit within you I like that in this because the minute explains a little more of this but it's a spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwells in you therefore brother we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for we live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spin do mortify once mortgage my mortar more solidified bring something together it's my brother Brennan see it talks about the only spirit more during this together you know sealing it together let's read them let's read the original verses that so what if I didn't mean to kill do I come we're going left a minute we are going to do this right here I find it for God to kill literally okay metaphorically is made to die destroy render extinct by death to be liberated from the bond of anything bond of anything literally to be made dead in relation to something all right okay so if you mortify that does mean to die that's correct but you die well let's get back your hand you can't kill the deeds of the body totally because we're still living in flesh okay but we know that through the spirit that there are some things they have to die and then God seals because when you die they put you in a tenement in what seal you up that's why that your husband's got to be dead you can marry again because he ain't allowed he's dead he's sealed and that's the same way with when I'm clean spirit goes out of a man if you put Christ in there he can't come back and get in the same place he got anyone because there were things that he mortified because that's what I like said mortician and all those things come from what they deal with dead things right they mortify the deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God now this is where Paul has come to here in verse 13 and he's telling us that we're debtors not to the flesh to live out so what is he doing he sees pulling everything apart for us all right but what he says about him whereas many others don't led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God that's the whole summation of verse 1 through 13 all the other things are you know things that happen but if you're led by the Spirit of God you're a son of God but for ye have not received the spirit of bondage now the spirit of bondage is the debtor and all these other things listen if I'm dead you can't put me in there if I'm dead you can't accuse me of being a thief right right you can't put me alive it if I'm dead I'm dead so if you not if you have for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry of my father our father father so here we've received the new birth first 1 through 13 the whole summation is there's therefore now no condemnation to walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the lawless spirit of life in Christ has made us free from the law of sin and death and then Paul takes and tells us about it all the way down to verse 13 and then he sums the whole thing up in verse 14 for those there to live by the Spirit of God the other Sunday night and daughter's amen for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear that's our problem see fear has moved from the inside man because there's no fear if you're born again that's what we don't understand there's no fear in the end man that's God himself he has no fear remember Adam was the one it was afraid that I was afraid guys never been afraid what's he been afraid of he made this place and he knows what's gonna happen in two seconds three seconds thirty you know I mean how steadily what it means you knew the exact well I don't know tomorrow if we knew what was gonna happen exactly tomorrow we brought my shooter itself no no but but God knows that though he has no fear because he's not in the human humanistic realm like we are right then he had no fear fair not so the soul has no fear so where's the fear I fear because I remember things memory you know what a reason that this wall is so thick I can't go through it but now if Jesus was here he did this step rattling in the building there prattling back out see Jesus Jesus did walk to the wall and hesitate no Ronal he just come right on through never bother him he never had to you know you see movies sometimes you know where they're dragging their self worried if they didn't go through as they're pulling herself through now he just want there's no fairy just Walters right Lois sustained movies like that I'm sure her movie is that yeah that's one of those Saturday afternoon matinee movies you know those things that I saw you at the other day any hell yeah how much do we have to be you have to business that again message Church you see that the old go kids is they'll start talking about something like Tom Cruise or something some way old Charlie and say message you see a message preacher yeah so it's funny we have a little fun Hill but look we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear so your soul is not fear I mean anything what we got to do is let that man speak mm-hmm man that man can have control because our fear is I remember that wall solid and I can't walk through it well I just stopped myself right there because if I died at this very moment my soul didn't need a door to go outside horror or open the window my soul just goes into another dimension and it has to go through that wallet you know done that's what we have inside of it well so that's that's what the real you is and you you are going we are coming to the image bringing that man see probably say Oh wretched man that I am he said o wretched man that I am the middle guy he went on my soul being wretched My heavens no if you're born again there's no condemnation that's what we do we said condemn ourselves in our memory we the conscious affection imagination we do all that condemning when the souls in their crime what are you go mad what sin are you talking about that's why we see that the new birth though brings us a knowledge but it's never brought us a knowledge like today right I'll end up with this one we'll stop it because we're gonna start talking about adoption you receive the spirit of adoption when you're born again into the family you gotta be a son to be a okay you have to be a son or a daughter to be an error because he's fishing the talk without a man so we see we don't receive adoption we don't get the keys to the car the day we're born again no no we have tutors from trainers and we'll talk about that next Sunday we'll go into the Galatian just for a minute and read Galatians and then come back to the Romans but I really love and I preached on it many times both ls2 of romans 14 three down to the end because this is where we're going to come to the place - we're waiting for the adoption to wit our to witness our to understand the redemption of our body nobody's ever understood full redemption until today twelve we're coming out the seals on that fourth seal the rapture takes place so good in that fourth seal something's going to happen to you we got to come to a complete adoption we got to get the data on the ground we got to take a lot of change and then we going around so and we're in that time right now we'll stop right there but let that inside man to do the work you got to let him do the work we've been trying to figure things out ourselves too much tool he's really mentioning that [Music]
