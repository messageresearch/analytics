«  153       †        Now, and a strong Angel... Now, verse 2, the strong Angel with a loud voice proclaiming, "Who is worthy?" Worthy for what? "Who is worthy to take that Book?" Now, we find out... Where's the Book at now? To its original Owner, because it has been forfeited by a son, the first son of God in the human race. And when he forfeit his rights to listen to Satan, he give up... What did he do? He accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's Word.

«  133       †        And as soon as he made... When this Angel, this mighty Angel, cried out "Who is worthy?" he was advertising right then, he was advertising for a Kinsman Redeemer. And immediately after, he said, "Who is worthy to take the Book?" Then something... Then John started weep. Then what happened? He seen, there stood the Book. There It was, but who was worthy?
Well, there stood Gabriel, course, he was worthy; but, see, he wasn't a man, and he was an Angel. And there stood Michael, he was worthy; but he wasn't a man, he was an Angel. So it had to be somebody that became a earthly person like we did. And then when he seen this Lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world, come up, and he seen that He had been slain all the way to the foundation of the world, then John wept. Amen! 'Cause there it was, he saw the whole thing.

«  159       †        The Angel's call was a call for the Kinsman Redeemer to appear. God said, "I have a law, a Kinsman Redeemer can--can be a substitute." Where is that Kinsman Redeemer? Who's able to take it?
And it come from Adam all the way down through all the apostles, and prophets, and everything else, and nobody was found. Now, what about that? Nobody in heaven, nobody on earth,...

like that song yeah hello turn it down okay how about now then oh okay good you had to be in the house of the Lord now everybody heard what I said the first time so look at the matter it's a little warm in here so y'all gonna get that sleepy spirit on you so just start praying now that you won't get it in a few minutes so let's turn our Bibles to Revelation chapter 5 we're on the the the chapter of Redemption and heading into the seals but there's a few things that we need to get out of the way number one last Sunday we're talking about being worthy we know Christ was worthy but we must also see that in Christ we are worthy because we have to be able to see the whole plan of redemption not just part plan of redemption the whole full plan of redemption all the way to a body change so and I believe revelations 5 shows us that and today we're going to talk a little bit about the throne because there's a dispensational change in Revelations 5 that you have to see all right there's a dispensational change that we have to come just like we've been talking about coming out of the church ages into the headstone there's a dispensational change well then there must be a people that can take that dispensational change amen because Martin Luther under the Son of God revelation the just shall live by faith that was his revelation God anointed that God quicken that and God gave a group of people the new birth from that but now today we can't take just that and take even take a rapture with that because that is would be the first form or stage of our justification to sanctification of the baptismal Holy Ghost so we have to move up in Revelation we have to come from the what we call baby form justification where your sins are chopped off to the very justification that we're so justified that we were worthy for someone that was eternal to take that book a man because the lamb you know that lamb was eternal because remember he was slain before the foundation of the world he was way back in the mind of God but he had to develop down here in this dimension so he had to come here so we're gonna talk about the throne now I want you to remember today we always know that the throne when we say throne you sell it's the throne of my heart just hang on a minute before we get to that let's talk about a little bit about the throne but let's background some from last week so remember I know Terrance has announced all this on November all the other happenings but remember next Saturday night at 7 o'clock at Living Word Tabernacle I've got the addresses 4432 Kings Mountain highway in North Carolina funny tasting water we're gonna be speaking up there for brother Tim and there's gonna be a good many of us going so just keep us in your prayers also November the 11th at 2 o'clock at Center Baptist Church in helen georgia the address there and you can get them later it's 109 elrod road helen georgia if you want to come and be at jim's mother's memorial at 2 o'clock that's Saturday then remember November the 15th let's just cover these that Terrace didn't know anything about November the 15th on a Wednesday night brother jewel Forney will be preaching for us brother Dale and I are gonna go hunting we're going to still be in Georgia but we're going on a little hunt for three days and brother Jewell will come in on Wednesday preach for us then we're gonna take him hunting a few days with us too so also on November the 26th brother Joe green will be here to speak for us cuz they're coming down to hunt with us brother Joe green and Nathaniel and I'll be actually that Sunday I'll be at brother Michael teak so but we'll hook back up static Sunday night and maybe go hunt a little while so good to be in the house of the Lord let's go revelations five and read that Scripture and let's do a little background and then we'll get started let's bow our heads before me before we read down dear Heavenly Father we pray Lord that we've sang the songs we took up the offering we've done all the peripherals of the things that need to be done for a service to begin now I pray Lord that you would come and and make this service alive by the word of god being spoken let it be quicken let us take it home and let us use it in our everyday life just let it not be a one day affair Lord but let it be a 24/7 affair with you Lord just take this little feeble thought and break it down to the people Lord and it may it help them in in everything every walk in life and everything that they do father I ask you that you forgive us of our sins and bless us and take care of us be with the ones Lord that are on the highways the ones that are sick ones that are not with us today we pray this you'd be with them be with our brother and sisters they travel Lord a little bit later on for a few few days Lord and just be with them and take care of them be with the missionaries in the foreign fields Lord we always think about them give them fruit for their labor father and their work that's to be done Lord I pray this you just take us now and sanctifies for this journey reveal yourself to us today father that's the greatest thing we want is revelation more than anything else Lord thank you for the people here Lord we ask you to bless them take care of us clear our mind so that we can hear from you father in the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things amen revelations 5 verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes now we may get to that today or that maybe the next section of the seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth and do all the into all their because they must be important or they wouldn't be in the Bible they must be important they're in a position right here in the midst of the throne and the midst of the elders stood a lamb and not not a separate scene the same scene you've got a lamb with seven horns and with seven eyes so it must be a part of the lamb it's not something that John saw somewhere else he saw that attached to the lamb all right and we know that the lamb is covering redemption but we'll get to that in a second he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts in four and twenty elders fell down before the Lord having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou a slain and has redeemed us to God now look and they sing a new song alright so it's a new song it was something new man it was a new song thou art were not an old song passed over as a new song thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals for thou was slain and hast hashed that's already half has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred tongue people and nation and have made us now you go from looking at the lamb but now John is bringing it to these people whoever these people are we know they're just abroad Christ we know that and have made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on our over in the original is over the earth you may be seated in the Lord I just blessing to the reading of the word now we come to a time that we want to background just a minute and then we want to look and see what's going on with this throne because if we don't it's like brother Branham said of that and I'm going to use it probably next week but we all should know this that the prophet of God told us that in the church ages we couldn't get all the way out seven sevens is 49 that's the fourth seven Church ages seven sevens is forty-nine the 49th year you had a Jubilee or every seven years you how did you believe and only part could go free not everything could go free but on that Jubilee year the 50 is when everything could go free well seven seven is forty-nine that's your church ages so you're in the forty nine you're not in that 50th Jubilee year not yet done all right now that's what we're looking at in our dispensation we got to get out of the church ages seven seven seven seven seven seven there's got to be an eight there's got to be something that comes over and shifts us out of the sevens into the age you say well last numbers let me just put it plain that it's going to take us from just being born again in our soul to being born again in our body it's gonna work its way and come out brother Bob did a real good job this morning talking about the soul body and their soul spirit in the body and and using the visual part of it was really good I enjoyed that and then down through the church ages that's what happened we had men men of God the seven horns and seven eyes were what the seven spirits are and the eyes were what the seers what the seven churches messengers Paul Iranians Martin Luther all the way down Martin Columba Luther Wesley all the way down to brother Branham we know that that's what the seven spirits of God the seven seers the seven eyes a revelation in each age and brought us to a place and that's what I want us to see is that you and I I was telling them this morning you know we we the voice of the Resurrection must be in the bride but the voice of the Resurrection and I hope you get this right the voice of the Resurrection can't be in a dead person somebody has passed on is not they have look they have they have lived their voice they have lived their time they have lived their revelation a man why did the two angels tell tell the disciples is why seek ye the living among the dead why why why are you coming here to look around because and even we talk about an inheritance you can't there's two things gonna happen when a wills read when the Wills read somebody's got to be dead and somebody's got to be alive amen you don't you know I'm not trying to be morbid but if Jews mother has an inheritance well if June and Amy and rich are all dead how you going to call them to the well how you going to call them the reading of the inheritance they have no inheritance their inheritance has to be passed down to someone that's alive so you and I we we honor all those but like brother Dale we can't keep looking back we can't sure we can go and get something from Paul and Iranians and Martin and Lutheran Columbus on Oral Roberts Billy Graham there's there's things in there Clarence Larkin there's things that they have that are pieces but you and I are not pieces we've got to come to a full body Redemption something they didn't come to because they only had a piece of the picture they only had they only had a small piece but we can take all seven eyes and all seven horns we can take all seven revelations we can take everything and have it put together for us by a prophet in the end time that gave the word to us and I'm going to say this again you know we I can't see how you can have a preacher in another dimension this is a live ministry a loud ministry somebody can stand and look you in the eye they say you're not doing right or you are doing right or you're this or we're doing that there's got to be a live demonstration amen so you and I have got to look at a live demonstration coming from a live group of people but frankly were the deadest people that ever live if you're not dead in Christ you're not alive amen the Bible says watch she's dead while she's living the world out there oh man they think they're so live but even like brother Branham I mean in the 60s look how innocent we think the sixties are compared to now and he sees that woman running through the hallways saying this is life you know with a with a beer bottle or whatever in her hand you know and half her clothes on one out now they have no clothes on you know they're walking through they're doing the same thing this his life will be their dead while they're alive now you and I have to be dead in Christ to be alive in him amen so that's why this revelations five we have to see that that when John and them there's two things brother Branham I don't think I brought it but brother Branham calls it one time a scene then he calls it a vision all right so we got to know one thing's for sure that when John was caught up in Revelations four we'll get to this in a minute but he caught up in Revelations for one he sees one on the throne so we what we've got to do with this revelation is four and five we got to unscramble this scene of the these different people lamb lion one on the throne one hand in a book tour one group taking a book from another person but it's not another person it's the same person doing the dispensational work hey man cuz remember that's what struck me and we'll read it very last of this going into the first seal you must see and have the revelation that's why the prophet of God had to line everything up you can't open the seals with a father son Holy Ghost doctrine you can't open the seals with a Trinitarian doctrine God won't allow that because thy brother Nell and I were talking the other day and you can take this any way you want to take it but there's one thing for sure this day of of will preacher with you believe it this way that's fine and I believe it this way that's fine and whatever you think and what that's gone listen Jesus never walked up to the Pharisees and said now you've got a doctrine it's okay no hello now hey he didn't come up and he go well now he didn't even a significant Dimas you're the greatest teacher of Israel and you don't even know what I'm talking about now Nicodemus have a good revelation I'm sure of what he had right but jesus never compromised on anybody else's doctrine listen John's doctrine was good for a while Bob read it this morning kind of struck something in my heart - to bring another message but remember when let's take the type's now when John goes off the scene he's the Elijah number three right when John the Baptist dies and goes off the scene who comes on the scene Christ the head comes on the scene the fullness of the Godhead bodily I told you I got something on there the fullness of the Godhead bodily comes on the scene hey man now you go over in the book of Acts where the fullness of the Godhead bodily comes into the group of people many membered body not one the many members by the 120 the 3000 now you keep reading in the book of Acts Paul finds a group they're still believing in John the Baptist John's gone John is not alive but he meets a Paula who is preaching what Jesus Christ but they were disciples of John the Baptist then they met the ones in Ephesus that what what we know we were baptized under John they're all going back look that same spirits here today the prophet of God introduced us to Christ quit looking back he's gone his voice lives on but the voice of the resurrection will not come out of his mouth it'll come from the mouth of the bride hey man we weren't know squat if he didn't come but he's coming brother's message are we so enamored at John the Baptist until we're still holding his doctrine years after John's already dead no Christ eat what crap Christ do Paul come on people Christ food Paul said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe believe who John's message I believe John's message but John's message in its written form will not ever save one person but you get the person John was talking about I'm talking about John I'm talking about the lives of the day you get that person inside of you that's why there's only one kinsman redeemer we'll read it in a minute there's only one man could give his life and then take his life and come inside of you kill you and he'd be alive in you now CF revelations 5 because when he took that book he didn't have a problem he didn't stop and go well never when I talked about was that right when I talked about no he took the book because he was worthy like Bob said his flus were not stopped up when outlook our flus are stopped up but I'm gonna tell you something one day a man little hook-nosed Jew named Paul walked up one day and he said you will be judged by what I say now listen if we're to be judged by what he said he must have preached a perfect message cuz you can't judge somebody from an imperfect message hey man come on it's time there is a perfect message and we must get under that what about Paul he comes down he says you be judged by my gospel who do you think you are Paul says I don't know who you think you are but I know the Lamb I was once lost I was once the man that put all of you in prison think about it the great Paul Apollo's I'm not Anna nice he questioned God right cuz cuz God visits Hannah nice in a vision and sense this was a man coming down here and said his name Saul and then I said his flesh and in his spirit now so not but he was like this guy's killing us this guy if I let him in my house he may not kill me but my friends will probably kill me go this guy's putting us in prison but you know what God said God said fear not in us because I'm sending him to you Paul didn't just wander through the streets no he said I'm sending him to you because remember the seed life has to come through the body Paul see that's why I said but these people think he always was eternal if Paul always was eternal why didn't that light when they struck him down on the road to Damascus why did he go have to see him not to get the scales off his eyes widened the Bible say he had to go be prayed for by Annalise lay down hands to receive the Holy Ghost why because anna and i said received the baptism of the holy ghost and paul had not but remember though when it happened though paul had to work now that word was already in Paul's life he just was using it wrong same way with you and I you and I have a gift and the gift that we use we used it wrong but when God gets the hold of you in tears that old part out and puts his self in then he takes that same thing and uses that don't remember brother Ronnie had born a prophet if Paul was a prophet he was born a prophet no that's not even in my notes that one's free I'm gonna charge you for that one not all right but there's a perfect message the prophets message is a perfect message amen now listen what are you gonna do though when you say well I don't need anything but the Prophet okay I don't need anything listen Jesus walked up one day and he had a whole big crowd of people he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me let's sing take the name of Jesus with you and go home that's what he did cuz remember he spoke his sermon he left he never stood up there and expounded and explained so here we are reading the Bible now it's in your Bible to eat his flesh and drink his blood now if we didn't have somebody to break that down and interpret that John the Baptist didn't do it because he was already dead he took a messenger a preacher to break it down and say Oh eat my flesh we take the wafer we take the communion wine and in symbolic because he said unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man he said you don't have no part with me right hey he said you're not even got what eat the body words and here william branham comes up he said we're feeding on the body word of the Son of Man bringing it and telling us exactly what Jesus was saying oh we're blind as a bat if we don't have somebody to tell us we're a bunch of sheep when no shepherd hey man how many of you have seen a dead Shepherd lead sheep and I ain't talking about sometimes dead as far as I've known about dead while they're living hey you take a false doctrine and you lead sheep with it brother Brown said false doctrine brings false birth so but what are they doing poor old sheep are still sheep they're being led but in Revelations 5 we'll get to that in just a minute we see that the lamb had no problem taking the book and whatever was in the book must have come to a position that's why I say revelations 5 to me covers to everything because when he takes that book and comes and sits down on the throne we're gonna read it where he comes and sits down on the throne and he start soaking in the seals someone during this time has got to come to a body change because for us to be kings and priests and rain on the earth that group of people in revelations chapter 10 are standing there in a glorified body so we went from revelations 5 where he took the book open it and showed us the complete plan of redemption we'll read there right here cuz look let's go to number one I get started in a minute the breach it is hard up here brother this is the most sublime thing in the scripture he calls it an act that not an angel not nothing could do it now we know that the lamb took a book all right from the one that was sitting on the throne said that was one on the throne then there was one that comes around and takes the book from the one that was sitting on the throne all right so now remember that we're gonna read these a couple from last Sunday number two thank you brother Aaron and you can if some of y'all get cold you can just start shouting and run around the building that won't bother me one bit it won't I'll think I'm in another Church but and while I'm at it since I told you to listen to brother runs Sunday school the other day which you should have enjoyed brother Bob did a matchless piece today too so you you should be listening to these cuz look let me let me just tell you something there's 85 to 92 sometimes a hundred people in this building right plus the people listened on Internet's more now now when brother Dale tells us to go back and watch his sermon and I keep watching it and there's only 30 hit 30 views 20 views 25 views I look on Reines and there's 22 views some of y'all ain't doing what nobody tells you to do and I can see it because if we go to youtube it tells you how many views you get okay anyway anyway yeah I can't hide from God YouTube will prove that YouTube so anyway you know that did you I know I know some of the tech-savvy guys there but I know most of you didn't know that you know you can watch that thing you can see every time somebody pulls it up yeah anyway alright number two that's that secret thing we give out this is not written in the word it's sealed on the back of the word the book was sealed by these seven seals now this is just background but watch the whole mystery of the book is sealed up in these seven seals now what look you say well the book survival but that book he's talking about you that's you that's the book of redemption now if you're in the book then you're already considered in Redemption so you're redeemable but remember only the ones considered are in that book that's not the foolish version that's not the cup of water in my name but I was thinking his brother Dale was speaking today that was way that the way that God would have come the way that God would have come there really wouldn't have been a Bible if there hadn't been a fall they really wouldn't have been a Bible so it would have just been us and what would we be talking about because we couldn't glorify the Father because he just made us but he made us with a choice and the choice gives you that godlike quality if you didn't catch that this morning will preach a little bit now that godlike quality is that's why the Bible says ye are God's you know what a God can do a God can change things now God is unchangeable that big g.od he's unchangeable but the reason he's unchangeable is he's already stole what was gonna happen I'm nipa tenth omniscient omnipresent you understand all those words but if he would have just come and we would have just come that way they'd been no we couldn't say it we wouldn't need to be dumb we wouldn't be preaching preach to what we're preaching to redeem us if we don't need to be renamed you see what I'm saying I've said it many times before this is the only way God could absolutely explain itself the way he wanted to be explained or he would have explained it I never won that's just real simple because a God goes God Almighty knew everything just think about if we were infinite see we can because we go to a certain place and we stop we go to a certain place and we stop but God's infinite he knows sister journey what you gonna do tomorrow next day next day next day next day now you don't I don't we have to wait till what happens but remember that doesn't take away her free moral agency her free moral agency is what she decides to do amen now what we're done though is we're influenced by God sure because God is gonna have his will here we go back to the will in the Testament he's gonna have his will because brother Graham said he'll take what permissive will and work it to its perfect well but now watch his perfect well as well as his life as well as his word so we must look into his word and it's the perfect word you say what he needs to change now who are you to tell God to change something yeah who are you to tell God come on you know when I when I was first Saved there in 97 99 thought God why why did I waste so much time why he said don't question I got in other words I got what I needed I got what I needed from you that's the way I wanted you to come or you'd be somebody else that's right so you are special God watched you all the way down you said like so many people they they are you limiting guarding in you become an unbeliever with God why what he said that what Gabriel tell marry with God all things are possible heavenly days woman why are you standing here down with God all things are possible how can a woman not know a man and we'll see she leaned to the carnal mind but remember it worked its way around to the perfect will of God when she caught that and said being unto me according to thy word when he said that the whole mystery of the book is sealed in these seven seals this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of Revelation now taking all into account revelations 5 because remember that's that breach that's that gap or that's that canal that were that we come up to the church ages and we're hitting up against it like this even brother Branham was hitting up against it like this as of yet now mylan come forward and not being made known God I preached everything that you told me to preach yeah I'm I'm paraphrasing but but there's something here he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not being made manifest well then brother Brown knew then they was a further month of his month of his ministry hey man not in the years of preparation bringing all these quotes but not in the years of preparations but when he begins to sound his message amen this is one of the greatest chapters in the whole Book of Revelations alright let's go to number three we've already read these but we'll read them through real quick to get to our point this is the breeks now strong angel diverse to the strong angel with allow boys proclaimed who is worried this will work so much less Sunday worthy for what who is worthy to take that book now we find that where's the book out now to its original owner now whose original owner God Almighty the creator the one that was standing before time is that right standing before time with Adam and Eve Saint man one man standing before Adam and Eve before the fall that's the original owner because he was giving it to Adam right he was giving it to Adam but he had to what he had to take it back because it was forfeited by Adam Adam couldn't continue the plan because Adam was our redeemer he didn't have the title of Redeemer I don't mean to be in your way sorry I think Richard Marlowe he's the only one bless his heart I'm missing he's the only one that could take that and put stripes and dots and solids and make that tie work I can't do it I look down and go how in the world but I wore I wore solid so I could wear this type of this sister Oh Marlo gave me a bunch of ties so I sure do appreciate that he's waiting on us folks I'm telling you we we have got that's what our problem is I'm gonna say this I'll charge you for this and either when somebody goes away we just kind of forget brother Gary all the time I'm not gonna name them all and I'm not trying to rehash and make everybody start booing and crying don't do that they're in a way better place and wheel that's our that's our problem but remember they're over there waiting on us because they're not complete but oh people we got to come to a perfection here to bring them here the prophet of God said all I saw over there was perfection well how are you standing in perfection and willing to come back to this corruption no this corruption will put on in corruption right here in this dimension by what by the preaching of a live word let Bob said there has to be power behind this work where's the book at now to its original owner because it's been forfeited by son the first son of God and in human race and when he forfeit his right to listen to Satan he give up what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's Word so what happened God had to take that book back the book that had our names all written in them revelations 13 8 all will be what deceived except the ones that had their put had their name put on the book of the life of the Lamb before the foundation of the world amen listen we can't lose we just got some battles look we gotta go through amen but the war's already won the war is won all right when he forfeit his right to listen to Satan now number four this is one I like because then John started to weep what happened he's seen there stood the book now how the book stand now I want you to look now we've got one hold hold on a minute I was gonna try to draw this but you just gonna have to get it by revelation there's one sitting on a throne there's a lamb and even the book that the man on the Thrones got is standing up he said there stood the book so in other words there stood the book so wouldn't you think that maybe the lamb and the book is the same person maybe we'll get something here there it was but who was worthy well there stood Gaber of course he was worthy but see he wasn't a man he was an angel see Gabriel didn't have any sin but he'd never been a human and when we fell we fell in humanity we didn't fall well I say Adam Adam didn't fall in soul he fell in his flash he fell in what his spiritual being right so what God had to come back through the same way yep if we fell this way and God being consistent and constant he had to come back to the same way there stood Michael boy you think Michael man he could take that book well you know what wait a minute who's Michael well there's another person standing over here here's Christ's brother Brad said Michael was Christ here's Christ here's one sitting on the throne here's one standing in front of the throne and the one that's got the book in his hand the book standing right here this scene is getting full but I want to tell you I'm gonna try to get that last quote where brother Brown I'll read it if I don't have time or not we're gonna read that last quote I found so it had to be somebody that became a what earthly person like we did and then when he seen this lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world come up and he seemed that he had been slaying all the way to the foundation of the world then John Webb amen because there it was he saw the whole thing number five real quick the angels call was to call for a kinsman redeemer to appear God said I have a law kinsman redeemer can be a substitute now if you want to find that if you look in your Bibles it's in the Book of Leviticus 26 or somewhere in there where he lays out that it must be kin and it must be this must be that because remember what Boaz was doing he was just doing what the law was telling him to do right the law of redemption or the law of kinsman redeemer it came from Adam all the way down through all the apostles and the prophets everything else and nobody was found now what about that nobody in heaven nobody on earth nobody that ever lived Elisha was standing there Moses was standing there all the apostles were standing there of all the ones that had died all the holy men Joab and the sages everyone was standing there and nobody was worthy even to look at the book let alone take it and break the seals Wow look how powerful this seems becoming number six Revelation chapter 5 1961 as soon as he advertised who is worthy he was advertising the coming of the kinsman redeemer and here he stood a lamb and what did he do walked over to the throne where the Spirit of wait a minute I thought the Spirit of God was in the lamb you see what I'm saying how that it is kind of easy that if you read the Bible in a certain way you could see a Trinitarian because you got people standing everywhere but without the alignment of the profit bringing the word down the way it's supposed to be brought down knowing that these are just exactly like brother Dale I mean it's so simple though it's profound they see something else but you take me as a as a human person to my wife I'm a husband I fulfill all that characteristic but now if Josh walks up that's my son so I become a father all right a father figure I become a father to my grandbaby when dear went now when Jim and I are together I'm not saying about grandbaby right that's my wife but when grandbaby comes I don't pull this skin off and put a new one on no I changed my characteristic that I can play with my grandchild be happy with her do like brother Homer says I like my grandchildren two ways coming and leaving now see I don't like Jim that way I like her to stay but my grandkids I can only take a few days then they're gone and that's the truth why cuz you're Doty old granddaddy you change your characteristic and you are totally out of character to what you would be to your children you see it the same way with God there's God standing that one person and look at all these acts that he's playing if they haven't gotta be at three places at one time how can God be preaching in Africa right now and preaching here a little bit have you gotta be saving somebody in Russia that's the Holy Ghost right and then Holy Ghost is here today in you right okay God can be anywhere he wants to be but he's only one walk go to the throne with the Spirit of God was that now look that's a scene so he had to walk over and take the book out of the right hand him him that said upon the throne and all the elders fell down and said thou art worthy because thou was slain why he paid the price of redemption and then he became then his book or at least the book of read em or the book of intercession in the church age was finished now he becomes the Redeemer now just like I told you last Sunday now what we have to do is it's when we go to Revelation six it shows how that he did it revelations five is pretty much a commentary of what he did took the book sat down on the throne opened the seals we started screaming we got a body change now what brother I'm saying now the revealing of how he did it it's gonna be in these seven seals so you got to go to Revelation six we got to get revelations five right remember we got to get the baby turn the right way in the cloud we got it we don't we don't need a breech birth and remember also that word breech means to what to breakthrough if you have a breach of security someone has what went through your security plan and breached that security what and took a step into a place that got it if I understand that so that is the blood is the breach this this this the BRE ACH all right so it's a breach between the church Hades in the sealed something had to breach and pull us together but also there was a breach birth because we were sitting in the church a Jesus being birth go to church hey nothing wrong with that living the Word of God but they all died they all died the mentality is I'll fly away when I die hallelujah by and by right that was their revelation though sure I'm sure they read well when the when the we which are alive and remain I'm sure that scriptures been read a thousand times through the ages but it's never been placed and clicking it's never been placed it's got to be placed it's always been the cow and the tree and the grass but it's always been in the church ages the cow in the tree and the grass down here and the cows in his wrong place amen but he took it what a masterbuilder he took a prophet to bring the cow down not bringing a different cow I didn't on calling the Word of God a cow but you bring his knees taking the Word of God that's already there and he's bringing it down where there folks were supposed to be all right man now the revealing of how he did it is going to be in these seven seals now we know that it's like when the book of the me tutorial work of him was done the work was finished now in the first three chapters of the church finished but now Redemption Redemption is to be revealed now now listen brother Branham wasn't there redemption in the church ages sure right to him that overcometh will I give to him that overcometh will I give to him the over count seven over comings to the church ages but that didn't get them all the way out so as redemption is to be revealed it must be something that man has never seen before [Music] read it all of our life read it all their life let's see number six well we're that number six that's number set let's go to number seven we're good there buddy all right saying man this okay well they got a few things I want to bring here before we number seven now and he saw one sitting upon the throne with the book in his hand his right hand think of it now he's in the breech now then in this book was the title deed to Redemption and it will see what seven seals now look that book has got to be people names of people that are redeemable and that have been redeemed yes now you say well what about the world remember all that secondary the animals the world is all secondary because when man fell everything fell under him all right when he failed this all fell with it but now what's got to happen this don't come up first and then us we got to come back to our position and this automatically comes up and man so that brings what the title deed to Redemption sealed with seven seals once that's broke you know you can worry about things that are happening out in the world that's okay but I'm going to say it one more time the only reason that these things are happening in the world is because you and I are coming to a place you and I are coming to a position nothing I don't believe anything has ever happened in history since the day of Pentecost when God m-more feed into his last end more feet on the earth you hear me on the earth in a bride everything has happened because that bride was on this earth everything anything that happens God's got to reveal it to his bride first he's got to give it to his family first then an angel came forth the strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to take the book who was able to open the seals who was able to open this book see the angel asked it John saw it he said Noseworthy let him oh my maybe I'm just feeling this away but let him said the angel let him and then he stops look he's gonna make a point he stopped let him here's the book of redemption here is the plan of redemption here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed so don't go looking anywhere else for here is the title deed to redemption of the whole heavens and earth let him come forward if he will oh my now speaker forever hold his peace let him come forward and claim this book who's worthy to do it John said there's no man in heaven found worthy no man on earth no man beneath the earth that ever lived and died was found worthy no man was found worthy but remember as we were talking about last Sunday and we have to see this by revelation that that the progression of the scripture brings us down to where he has made us unto God kings and priests so something is developing in this time if Christ is worthy the lamb is worthy to take the book then he must have made somebody worthy because remember he doesn't need Redemption he didn't need redemption he was the Redeemer so he's not doing it for himself right he's doing it for us because they want to read you something right here before we get into revelation three brothers you don't have these but it's some that we've read before I want you to read don't you listen to this this is what this lamb has done for us I've read it before adoption series inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance now remember this is me somebody had to die hold I'm sorry that good somebody had to have something you got to have something to give right you can't just you know the reading of the will is not just Charlie was a good of guy and he said by that kind of rhymes Charlie was a good old boy and guy and he said by but now look why cause Charlie did everything together but when something's there there's an inheritance already in place it's waiting for the person to die that sounds morbid but you're waiting for the person to die and then what the will is read and given to the alive people that are sent into reading of the world today you're setting it the reading of the world because watch somebody had an inheritance somebody died and somebody has reading you the will and telling you what you got inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody to leave me an inheritance well you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance right this is a profit doctrine serious you've heard me read it before to me that to me that one that one quote right here lines everything up but I'm gonna read you another one it lines it on up a little more beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God gave you your inheritance your inheritance was first listen the one sitting on the throne had the book it had to be taken from someone on this side cuz this one right here get what I'm saying this one here was not in flesh this one was so where do we need Redemption the son of God never needs a Redemption now the son of man never need a Redemption but he got in inheritance code I'm pacing read something else Revelation chapter 5 now our kinsman has handed the seventh sealed book of redemption from the original owner the original owner when we lost it at the Garden of Eden this is what we're gonna talk about it Tim Hume so y'all just go to sleep and say man they everyone okay the original owner when we lost it at the Garden of Eden through Adam it went back to the original owner but there's been a poacher on the land a squatter in that Satan he came over he's a poacher this earth don't belong to him belongs to God but he's a poacher a squatter man how I could say something right now but I better not it's the titled that listen is the title deed of our redemption this seven sealed book it's the title deed you wait till we get to those seals now this is Revelation chapter 5 they don't have it up a look he breaks the seals what watch one sitting on throne with a book lambs hear the lamb takes the book what cup sits down on the throne becomes one throne I read the quote man opens the book and what reveals the seals okay let me guards is that watch but look you way do we get into those seals he breaks the seals reveals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited now this guy sitting on the throne is the inherit or this one received an inheritance this one didn't need one he was the one that held the inheritance this one was the one that had to come and take the book he gives he breaks the seals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed but instead of keeping in his self he gives it back to his people Gabriel's instructions to Daniel now we find out he was our kinsman redeemer and he took the book out of the hand of the original owner it is the title deed to Redemption we find that you remember the study it's a title deed of redemption is an abstract deed with it that God required life or death in the Garden of Eden then Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals revealed what was in them and give the inheritance that belonged to him to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that while making crops out if you don't understand what he's talking about now Jesus as Bob said this morning Jesus didn't need eternal life he was eternal life but his body would you see what these sales are for these sales are not for the redemption of your soul it's for the redemption of your body Christ come back with a glorified body and he said all power in heaven and earth has been given unto me I don't have to be bound by a water I don't have to be bound by being tired and had to sleep he'll know we go to sleep on a boat anymore I promise you that and a glorified condition but what did he do that was his intelligence that was his intent heritage but what did he do he given us eternal life that he inherited now that make he cross-eyed now some time he passed his old life back out at Calvary and divided among us by the Holy Ghost there's another person people running all over no man has ever been able to to even think of the love that that was that he did now folks were selfish bunch of people and I'm selfish about my internal life yes I am but I'd like to give it out to my brother Dale said Christ literally did it you and I can't yeah I can't give you my eternal life it's impossible it's mine but I can lead you to the man that can give it to you I can lead you to the Redeemer that can give it to you because what he's worthy but through a preacher live preacher he can look you in the eye discern your sin you can't discern from another dimension right you got to be in this dimension to discern the spirit all right revelation 3:21 we gotta get finished real quick to him that overcometh will I grant to sit now this is in our age right every church age got a an overcoming in our church age this is our overcoming to him and overcoming with like grant to what sit with me in my throne not owned in even as I have overcome what God give his life took the book and reveal the seal right and I'm sit down with my father and here strong everybody got that say man now what is a throne he's got the Thrones in my heart listen when you first the first thing when you think of a throne what do you think uh I think of authority position sure it's in your heart I know that good grief no child I know that the throne of God is in your heart but what is it throne symbolized Authority a position that you've come to that that obviously no one else has come to that comes remember John didn't see 15 Thrones hold on a minute now hold on at that time huh cuz remember at the white throne judgment they were thrown we've been given something we've been given the authority to judge so we have a throne but now we didn't in this scene because we had everything hadn't been finished you see I'm God you see how God places everything revelations 41 John saw one Centon on throne he and see 14 Thrones 14,000 throne the for elders four and twenty elders they weren't sitting on the throne there was one person sitting on the throne all right revelations chapter five verse one number eight so just when he said an elder come forth or a strong angel weep not for the Lion of the tribe of Judah a man the root of David he has prevailed a man conquered in other words what we were talking about last Sunday he was worthy to the book remember he hadn't seen him up to this time why he was sitting on a seated on a throne in there God's throne he wasn't he was on the inside of the sanctuary right got it he hadn't seen him to this time so John was expecting to see line came forth but he saw a lamb now listen we got to stay on the lamb because remember the lamb is the one that breaks to seal so let's don't worry about the line of Judah forget that right now if we don't get the lamb part right you're not gonna worry about because what line is a judge line is bold he's he's the judge but watch sorry let's go to the next one number nine souls in prison John looked around there was no one in heaven no man on earth nobody in no angel nothing could take the book or the loose the seals don't even look at it no man was worthy John said he wept bitterly now what's what's he looking for he's not looking for an angel he's not looking for a what a theophany hello he's looking for a human with some skin on him then an angel came to him and said we've not John for the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he is worthy and John look to see a lamb are Swift to see a lion and what did he find a lamb and it was a bloody lamb a land that had been slain because the Bible said he stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right how long since the foundation of the world the lamb came forth walked up to him that had the book in his right hand and received the book climbed up on the throne and sat down that's it it was over when the seals was revealed I agree a hundred percent when they're revealed remember he told them they went revealed back then he said you're not getting it he told him they were all right but we're in this dispensation we're alive and remain we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those sleeeeep okay so now we're here we're here we read the quote he said they weren't getting it they weren't getting it cuz the Prophet said they weren't getting it but there is a group that's gonna get it alright it was over when the seals was revealed when the last one that was everything that he'd redeemed there was nothing he came to redeem him safe why didn't he redeem them forty years ago 2,000 years ago see their names are on the book of life in that book now watch he what's he asking the question why didn't he redeem them to tell what happened 2,000 years ago he died on a cross everything was done when he said his finished he went lying but remember it wasn't applied until we got here I wasn't here at Calvary you weren't here at Calvary but my name got called called it was in that book alright here he had to stand here because it was God's purpose to redeem them their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the lamb was put there with it the inheritance he inherited I like that here comes the lamb when was slain came back to make intercession all right now let's read number 10 right here's what one against where every wanted to get to for an hour and then we went back and got the kinsman redeemer and picked him up what he's work was and now for all these years Christ has been doing the kinsman redeemer work now all the understand that say a man wake up you can say a man if you'll wake up I don't know you need to what he'd do is take you a little thank you a pen and some of y'all need a big one and God forbid if one of you husbands or wives punch each other and get mad at each other for waking each other up now you're going work you go answer to God for that your mates helping you stay awake if not either one of you may not care care if the other one makes it but I can't Jim likes it then alright hey man we got a struggle s and it's a fight it's an overcoming I'm not going Church today I'll watch it online you're not an overcomer you're not an overcomer he that overcometh gets in his car where they feel like it or not but wait you want to go to church every Sunday know what it's like the joke about the woman saying honey get up you gotta go to church I ain't going to church yeah come on honey you gotta give a guy go to church he said I'm not going to church the son he said then people bunch hypocrites they don't love me and I ain't worried about it she said honey you're the pastor you gotta go to church but there come a time that when the redeeming work will be over and when the redeeming work is over this kind of works all that was done it then he leaves the throne of God where he's seated now now let's stop right there now listen his intercessory work remember down to the church ages he was the son of God his his people were born again under the revelation on this rock I'll build my church amen and not belittling them at all but that's all they needed to know they didn't have a quote book they'd hardly have a Bible but they believed that Christ died for their sin and God you know what he was just purchased good hey I'm so happy if that's all they see they're my children I saw that they didn't want anything but me that's why here in the end time if we if we come up higher we have to not to get a revelation like Bob said not to get a revelation beyond the prophet lord have mercy how in the world huh I can't hardly get this one how am I gonna get another one a new one can't but there will come a time when the redeeming work will be over when the redeeming work is over then he leaves the throne of God remember he's seated he's interceding now you got to see this watch because remember the son of man who came to earth here we're gonna change positions a little bit here the Son of Man comes to earth he's the Redeemer he's the one that gets the inheritance father God doesn't need an inheritance he is the inheritance the son of God eternal life but when you come to this Redemption scene that lamb the Prophet God said I think it really a couple of Sundays ago that lamb wasn't a lamb is what we see because a lamb can't reach and get a book it had to be a human but it was the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world what the son of man but when he left he comes back on the day of Pentecost that's the son of God he's sitting on the Father's throne there's got to be a position change to get us out of here that all rights a man all right because look I have overcome their watch now he goes back then he leaves the throne of God where he's seated down but that's not his throne that's not his problem you say oh my goodness this was sitting on the throne but you said this one just comfortable and turn around and sit down alone remember there's only one through one throne and one person sitting on the throne that's not three sitting on one that would be crowded God's real comfortable sitting on his own throne because he's the only one sitting on it hey man but now remember because when we become worthy and we come to the revelations 19 or 20 in there there's Thrones right you and I have come to a position he leaves the throne of God where he seated now but that's not his throne he that overcometh your with me in my song what church age is that this one he that overcomes will sit with me in my throne as I have overcome and have sit down on my Father's throne that is not his throne that belongs to Spirit God the Son of God the Creator the one before the foundation of the world theophany got that all right but that theophany God had to amor fie into a lamb son of man to take the book to redeem that's how revelations 5 is so sublime you see everything you see all the way from the creation the fall Christ coming bleeding dying give us an inheritance now look he's that's not his throne that belongs to Spirit God Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him now that's not saying that God sitting on the throne and saying now you can't come up here and settle in front of me that's not what he's saying but it's the position that's got to change the same man that's sitting on the throne is this one because when this one takes the book he becomes the one on the front all right that belongs to spirit God Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him he is the Incarnate God which is the same garden he's talking about Christ the lamb some of the guards not incarnate God it's not a man's incarnate God incarnate means that he'd come from spirit into flesh that all right I just want to explain that today okay number eleven John hadn't noticed this lamb before you know here he hadn't been mentioned before no word had it been mentioned John didn't see it all over the heavens as he was looking because remember he he was looking and found no one worthy then all of a sudden appears a lamb now the one sitting on Thrones always been there see John had to know that that person was in the position of supreme authority at the time because he had the book so he's standing holding the book when our John knows if there's not this can't get to John it's set to human that's why he said who's worthy I see all these well yeah others humans out here I see these angels standing here but who's gonna take his book who's going to do the redeeming work then what the lamb comes out from behind the throne brother Branham said he was behind we read in a minute it came from look where did it come from it came from what he was hidden in the Father's throne because remember the son of man revelation is not till the end time so he was hiding in the Son of God revelation amen but in revealing you've got what you got to come out and as he came out John saw him and you know what John knew who he was John saw him hanging on the cross John saw him after John saw him in a glorified body icewine down a little bit further we I read it yeah but John said everybody in heaven heard my voice everybody on earth heard my voice you are worthy so where did it come from to come from the father strong we had been seated since he had been slain and raised again hidden in the father strong what making intercession what he's interceding for us why the Lamb of God is who we look to amen all right say man he raised up and set on what the right hand of God ever living to make intercession a man raised there today as our intercessor today he's interceding for your thoughts that you got in your mind he's interceding for the things that we're gonna do next week in the next week in the next week what with his own blood to make intercession upon the ignorance of me put your name there if you want good oh now oh that's the one I'm depending on he still was covered with bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of sin all right number 12 real quick because we got to cover this that we got to get to it the breach how did you hold us see anything but that bloody lamb standing there and the lamb proceeded out into the vision now here he calls the division now as it had been slain notice come from the Father's throne Oh think where did he advanced from to this vision he comes from glory where he's seated at the right hand remember the Bible says he's seated at the right hand of God never making intercession why he can't be on the earth in that body not yet he can't be here he's got to be somewhere God's a person the body's not laying a brother brother Devon divided not laying up there on the throne he's alive and well he's not dead but he's sitting up on that Father's throne making intercession waiting on us to come to the revelation that he was down here in us he come from glory where he seated at the right hand of God he advanced forth to join out of glory so he came somewhere well okay look he advanced forth to me out of glory you got to put your name in there number 13 did you notice the arrangement of that now this is 1963 how can I overcome 8:25 so this is after the seals are broke all right did you notice the arrangement I like that southern take to all them eight eyes and you that call range Minh see the raiment of that see sit with me in my throne not on my throne in my throne that's his domain and now as Christ as the ruler throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in thrown see where his domain reaches a throne is over old domain and the domain reaches just as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity just think of it from eternity to eternity now let's read this last one we'll be done this is revelation of Jesus Christ this is in the church age book but let's just not stop there reading our revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him sitting down with my father in his throne also read Hebrews 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God that's what we're just talking about he's on the Father's throne making intercession but now we got a promise in this church age that we will sit with him in his throne not this one he is but now remember when he come around sit down on this one this is gets a little confusing but you got to let the Lord reveal it to you okay all right same God but watch what this says right here here sit down with the father what no I'm sorry did I read on notice that according to Jesus himself who wrote the revelation he has sat down with the father the spirit and Paul what spirit is the Spirit of Christ for that is the spirit of prophecy for by the word comes since he had sat down at the right hand of God but when John looked he saw only one upon the throne and it was not until revelations 5:6 2:8 which follows revelation 4 2 to 3 in sequence of time that we see the Lamb taking the book from him Capital age he did that I didn't him that sit on the throne as indicated in Revelation 4 2 3 and 9 through 10 what is it it is the mystery of one God right now we saw all kind of people run everywhere here in Revelations 5 we've had all people running all over the place where brother Brown said it's the mystery of boiling hot he Jesus came out from God became manifested in flesh died and rose again and returned to the bosom of the Father as John said the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him John 1:18 it was not now time it was now time for God Messiah to come back to claim his bride then present himself make himself known to Israel thus we see God again stepping forth to assume a physical relationship to man as the son of David King of Kings Lord of lords the bridegroom of the Gentile bride it is not to gods but simply one God manifesting his mighty triune offices and titles all that workings done by one man but we have to see his you say what what's what what in the world what is that important if we stay with the Son of God revelation we do as all the others we die and go by the grave and you know you hear this over and over of musicians come you hear this over and over but one day it's going to strike you with something we've got to move out of the birth canal the prophet turned us the right way he's brought something forth but you and I have got to take that and what oh that's a beautiful baby but it looks kind of bad have you fed it yeah I fed it about six months ago oh you have been to church in that long huh kind of funny when people get in trouble you start if you ever see somebody that you ain't seen in three or four months walking in that church door I promise you something's happened in their life and it ain't good most of the time find Jesus in jail I guess I don't know but we must see less tan we must see that we are eight we are alive people with a live message with a live ministry we are alive and well let's think he's alive and well can you do it can't do it it's in there somewhere it's in there somewhere you gotta find 350 in the spiral book he's alive and well living in white living in me to tell that he's the same he's he's the son of God on the throne he's a lamb taking the book he's the book he's the lamb he's John he's the elders he's the whole thing cuz without that one man saying in the beginning God created heaven and earth and he said let us make man in our own image and after our likeness and because you fall I'm gonna send one in my likeness ain't gonna be just like him he's gonna be right and he's gonna take the book and he's what he's gonna turn right back around and sit down but you know what during this time he picked up something he picked up a flash so he's gonna pick up your flash and he's gonna set you own a throne hey man you love the Lord trying to keep it to an hour but lluís keep singing songs all the time something yeah I'm just kidding you say let's say he's alive and well can you get that for me the best okay 350 andwell living in me to tell the world that he is the same he's the same yesterday and today and forever Jesus [Music] single again

well duh here's the same or he's the same yesterday too and forever praise God he's alive when you come up here and say what you need you are not confessing to me you're confessing it to God he's already made intercession for it so why do I have to pray I'm not the intercessor you just go straight to God you just believe that and when you take that thing to the doctor you take that thing to whatever you got you say I've already confessed it I confessed it to God what are you what are you I'm nothing but you came here expecting to hear from God not from me I can sit down and write you a book to tell you how to study how to pray it's worthless to you now to me I can enter in but do you it'd be worthless you don't have the same time I do you apply that attach that to your life attach that to what you need and when you make a confession you go back and say God I've already confessed that to you and when you go to the doctor and he says you got high blood pressure and you stand here and say when I go to the doctor I want him to tell me I don't have high blood pressure well why don't we need to pray you've already done it the confession was right here all you got to do is go to the doctor say hey doctor whatever you say I've already confessed I've already confessed the difference family problem same way you go home expecting something you say well when I get home I want everything to be what you told me that what am I gonna pray you've just said what you were gonna do your confession we must confess our sin the Bible didn't say come up and have the preacher pray and slap all over you and beat you in the head [Music] he said confess your faults one to another and what the Lord Himself will intercede for that and he'll take care of it listen laying hands is okay but it's a tradition it's a tradition the Gentile way is is what did what did the Centurion say he made a confession he said he said man I've got somebody sick at my house Jesus said well okay I'll oh goodness God was he said okay I'll get up and go to you how he said no now there was his confession no you don't need to come to my house look at the confession he said you don't need to come to my house I'm a man of authority I say go I say come you're a man of authority look at his confession you say go you say come you know what he's telling him he said Jesus whatever you say in that spot that's the way it'll be he said because I know when I tell the Centurion to go out didn't get me a cup of water and bring it back I know he's gonna do it cuz I've Authority so now you as a person of authority if you say and then What did he say he said I found no greater faith in Israel because Israel wants you to do this you know they want you to [Music] Jarius you know come in and touch my daughter the Centurion said look I have made a confession I know you know what he was saying I know what power lays inside of you because I have the same earthly power I don't have a heavenly power like that but I have an earthly power and I can connect that my confession is whatever you say jesus said go and let it be as you spoke and what'd he say remember the guy come running he said when did that happen he said about eleven o'clock or whatever in the Centurion said well that's the same time I was talking to the Lord same way with all of us just make your confession go to the doctor he says you got something wrong say okay but I've came here and I confess to who created this thing I've confessed to the man that created this you're here just to keep us lined up and that's really a doctor does he just keeps you lined up I'm here to keep you lined up or he's here to keep you lined up but there's one that can what create there's one that can take something out and make it totally disappear and not have to cut a gap this way hey man sister Mina didn't have to go to an operation to get that big old order or cancer off of her stomach what God just dissolved it and made it disappear now what doctor did that there is no doctor they can do that but when you make a confession you stand on that confession because you've confessed it to God you've not confessing it to you that we have such a Catholic idea brother down pray for my children but that when I get home we're gonna be playing cards and got the TV on and come on people we're not here sure we're here to what we do intercede if you need prayer no doubt but that's not the way it should be it should be believe in your heart and confess with your mouth and let God take care of it cuz you know what one day I couldn't find that father one day I was having a heart attack I know it was I couldn't find that father but I found a Heavenly Father and he's been with me ever since amen that's what you and I have to look at when you can't find your daddy you always got your daddy right there with you cuz you know what if you were in that book he's already took claims of it your body too your body - that's where the healing comes patina is what the potential body change hey man if you got scars you don't don't have a scar system II didn't have a scar that's potential body change when God took that thing out of our side they wouldn't scar there but if you got a scar somewhere you're not gonna carry that scar with you oh that's going away oh we could be here all day god bless you he's alive [Music] he's the same yesterday dude [Music] oh Jesus please Allah
