[16:00] oh
[16:03] oh

[19:55] open the eye of the mouth
[20:10] lift it up
[20:35] to power and love everything
[21:03] you see him as he unfolds because you'll
[21:05] never see the flesh man until we meet
[21:07] him in the air
[21:08] but you will see the word which is now
[21:10] becoming flesh in you and I
[21:13] so we thank the Lord for that revelation
[21:19] that we don't have to search for Jesus
[21:21] Christ
[21:23] we find him in his people amen
[21:27] and the experiences that we have and all
[21:29] the things that go with it
[21:31] so nothing is for naught
[21:34] I believe all things about that work
[21:36] together to them that are be called
[21:39] according to the purpose of God so
[21:42] that's our Our Calling is purpose
[21:45] everybody have the purpose in life
[21:49] whether it be to be just a
[21:52] a person that sits in a in a Pew and
[21:55] praise and goes to work pays their time
[21:59] um The Widow's might was worth more than
[22:01] all the gold that that any of the
[22:04] Pharisees ever give because you give
[22:05] with a True Heart
[22:06] right she gave all she had with a true
[22:09] heart she didn't go up there and go well
[22:10] I see these guys looking at me I'm gonna
[22:12] put to put all my money in so they'll
[22:14] think of me no she went up there with an
[22:16] open heart
[22:17] and say God this is all I got
[22:20] and he blessed her I would sure he
[22:22] blessed her abundantly if it didn't
[22:24] bless her on this side to give her
[22:25] eternal life so that's a big enough
[22:28] blessing to me you have all the money in
[22:31] the world
[22:32] swept the grid this morning posted even
[22:35] without charity whether you can have all
[22:37] the uh gifts and we could have healings
[22:40] and and uh we could have Mighty meetings
[22:44] and people be saved and healed but
[22:46] without charity
[22:48] without love true love one for the other
[22:51] not just not a not a makeup love but a
[22:54] true love one for the other
[22:55] if you got your Bible let's go ahead and
[22:57] turn to Joel too that's what we were
[22:59] trying to head to this morning
[23:01] I hope you enjoyed this morning service
[23:02] later man really enjoyed the uh you
[23:07] being here
[23:08] to listen to it because you couldn't say
[23:10] you enjoyed it if you weren't here
[23:13] two things I need to ask you a question
[23:15] um
[23:16] Jen's taking some of the kids Junior
[23:18] brother boys and Sister Janet I think
[23:20] Joyce is going
[23:22] to the Youth Camp next
[23:24] next Friday to Rutherfordton also next
[23:28] Saturday is the fellowship meeting so
[23:30] we're going to have bus conflicts or
[23:32] band conflicts we're either gonna let
[23:35] them go in the van which is there's
[23:37] eight or nine of them going
[23:40] let them have the white van and then us
[23:42] just go in regular cars
[23:45] to the fellowship meeting I think my
[23:47] Brown Band I can hold seven in it
[23:50] but I need to kind of know tentatively
[23:52] you don't have to raise your hand but
[23:54] just kind of letting know today if
[23:56] you're going to the fellowship meeting
[23:58] we know for a given who's going to the
[24:01] to the youth
[24:02] so I'd just like to know if there's not
[24:04] a whole bunch of us going to fellowship
[24:06] meeting then we can just do it in cars
[24:08] and don't don't not go
[24:11] just because we don't have room we'll
[24:13] make room for somebody if you want to go
[24:15] on Saturday pay your gas or or do
[24:18] something to get you to get you over
[24:20] there we're not trying to bribe you into
[24:22] going by no means
[24:24] but we will pay for you gas if you if
[24:26] you want to drive your own car if we
[24:28] have to use and them have the others I
[24:30] think Charlotte Richard's going to go
[24:31] for sure June uh it's going to be gone
[24:34] so I will probably be on the
[24:38] of ground and going to associate meeting
[24:40] so if anybody else wants to go I know
[24:42] Mom and Dad will be going so just let us
[24:43] know after service either tell June or I
[24:46] won if you're going to go to the
[24:47] fellowship meeting or if you're even
[24:48] thinking about going so we can kind of
[24:50] get all this together we only have one
[24:51] White Band and if there's eight or nine
[24:54] of those going to the Youth Camp I'd
[24:56] rather them drive yet but uh
[24:59] uh well let's just try to work that out
[25:01] if you don't mind so Joel two
[25:06] we're going to start at verse 21.
[25:08] and you can title this
[25:10] former latter rain
[25:13] let's buy our heads before we get
[25:15] started do you Heavenly Father we pray
[25:17] Lord that again you would come Among Us
[25:18] in a special way Lord
[25:20] that you would bind our hearts together
[25:22] in you not of our own self or anything
[25:25] we've done or anything special about any
[25:28] one Lord but it's you
[25:30] we were chosen in you before the
[25:31] foundation of the world Lord
[25:33] and we know now that we're realizing
[25:36] what's going on and why we were put in
[25:37] this age and while we were put in this
[25:39] hour
[25:40] and what we're supposed to do while
[25:42] we're here
[25:43] father we pray Lord that you will just
[25:45] now come and and bless us your words
[25:47] already blessed but Lord just Quicken it
[25:49] to our hearts
[25:51] Quicken it to our minds Lord that we may
[25:53] have the mind of Christ
[25:56] Lord may you come Lord not in a partial
[25:58] way but Lord in the fullness
[26:02] perfect Lord the perfect realization of
[26:05] the end time that we're your people
[26:07] and we're put on this Earth Lord to to
[26:10] do a work like no other work that's been
[26:12] done before father
[26:13] we pray now that we realize that
[26:16] take it and hold it nurture it
[26:19] let that seed grow into a mighty mighty
[26:22] oak tree
[26:24] father forgive us of our sins and our
[26:25] many mistakes and Lord the things we do
[26:27] wrong
[26:28] bless the missionaries on the foreign
[26:29] field

[26:45] we ask you things in the name of Jesus
[26:47] Christ
[26:48] amen
[26:50] y'all too
[26:52] all right now keep in your mind
[26:54] what we were talking about this morning
[26:57] and then let's just kind of break this
[26:58] down a little bit and see what we can uh
[27:01] see what we can come up with Joel 2
[27:04] verse 21 now we're going to come back
[27:06] and read again
[27:08] because
[27:10] this is talking to Israel
[27:15] but it's also talking to us because the
[27:19] Joel is telling this
[27:21] in response of Deliverance to Israel
[27:24] but listen fear not a land be glad to
[27:27] Rejoice verse 21.
[27:29] for the Lord will do great things be not
[27:31] afraid
[27:33] ye beast of the field for the pastors of
[27:36] the Wilderness do spring for the tree
[27:38] Beth or fruit the Fig Tree and the vine
[27:40] do yield their strength
[27:42] be glad then you children of Zion
[27:46] who's that right
[27:49] okay and rejoice in the Lord your God
[27:51] for he hath given you the former Reign
[27:54] moderately and he will cause to come
[27:56] down for you the rain the former and the
[27:59] latter rain in the first month
[28:02] and the floor shall be full of Wheat and
[28:04] the fat shall overflow with wine and oil
[28:07] and I will restore to you the years that
[28:10] the Locust has eaten the canker worm
[28:12] caterpillar Plum worm my great Army
[28:14] which I sin among you and you shall eat
[28:16] in plenty and be satisfied and praise
[28:19] the name of the Lord your God that hath
[28:21] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[28:23] shall never
[28:25] be ashamed you may be seated in the Lord
[28:27] as blessings reading the word also if
[28:31] you want to turn to James 5
[28:33] verse 7 brother John I'm having up here
[28:36] now
[28:37] be patient therefore brethren
[28:39] unto the coming of the Lord that's our
[28:42] great
[28:43] behold the husbandman waited for the
[28:46] precious fruit of the Earth
[28:48] what is he saying who's the husband
[28:50] Jesus
[28:52] what's he waiting on
[28:54] he's waiting on the precious fruit of
[28:57] the Earth but he knows he planted the
[28:59] seed all right he knows he planted the
[29:02] seed he's just waiting for it to him a
[29:04] tour
[29:05] and have long patience for it
[29:09] until he received the early
[29:12] and let it rain all right so the Lord
[29:14] adds a blessing to that
[29:17] now what we were talking about this
[29:18] morning
[29:19] was
[29:21] partial to perfect
[29:23] and I think everybody's kind of got a
[29:24] pretty good understanding about partial
[29:26] and perfect
[29:27] there's nothing wrong with partial if
[29:29] you can get away from it or if you can
[29:31] move from partial to perfect okay
[29:35] if you move from partial to perfect
[29:36] that's okay you stay impartial
[29:39] you say well is that not okay well what
[29:42] did we just read right here
[29:45] be patient therefore Brethren until the
[29:47] coming of the Lord behold the husband
[29:48] I'm waiting for the precious fruit of
[29:50] the Earth what you and I just waiting
[29:52] for us to mature because you do not
[29:53] Harvest like we were talking about this
[29:55] morning you don't go out and harvest
[29:58] they told me not to stand over there I'm
[30:00] gonna put the pulpit over here
[30:03] is that better thank you they say the
[30:06] glare on my top of my bowl look my bald
[30:08] spots
[30:10] whiten out the uh picture
[30:13] so anyway you know I told him the other
[30:15] day I said you know the Bible doesn't
[30:16] say anything about men not wearing
[30:18] makeup so I think we're gonna start
[30:19] wearing a little makeup you know it's
[30:20] only the women
[30:23] you don't scare you to dance if you saw
[30:26] some of these people like news
[30:27] announcers and stuff you see them on
[30:29] television they got they like their
[30:30] faces all powdered up well they'd be
[30:32] horrible to look at them you know before
[30:33] that but but since we're on TV now we've
[30:36] got to look like that
[30:38] but anyway if I say I don't care it'd be
[30:40] okay
[30:42] be patient until we receive the early
[30:44] and Ladder rain
[30:46] now
[30:48] perfect
[30:49] realization
[30:52] will bring a rapture
[30:56] so that's what we need to look at all
[30:58] right latter rain or partial I mean
[31:03] partial and former
[31:04] it's Foundation
[31:07] let me clear that up from this morning I
[31:09] thought I didn't say that partial
[31:11] is a foundation
[31:14] perfect
[31:16] is the fruit thereof see he's waiting
[31:18] for what he's waiting for the precious
[31:20] fruit
[31:22] he wasn't waiting on Luther's little
[31:24] little two shoes he wasn't waiting on
[31:27] Wesley's little stalk sure they were
[31:29] bragged they had their place but God is
[31:32] waiting on a mature bride
[31:35] to mature into fruit
[31:39] you don't get fruit off of this you
[31:41] don't get fruit off of a stalk when you
[31:43] get fruit out of mature plants only
[31:46] produce fruit
[31:52] only produce fruit
[31:55] all right Joy's waiting for the precious
[31:57] fruit of the what
[31:59] Earth
[32:01] this guy right here
[32:04] and have long patience for it he's
[32:06] waited six thousand years
[32:09] to get enough word to us for us to
[32:12] understand and to restore us back to
[32:16] where we should have been had there not
[32:17] been a fall is that correct
[32:19] so but God in his in his great wisdom
[32:23] God has
[32:27] give it to us a little at a time right
[32:30] you don't plant the seed two days later
[32:32] you gotta Harvest
[32:34] no right like I said you get a spring
[32:36] rain and it rains real good and then it
[32:38] stops raining for a little while
[32:40] it's kind of dry
[32:42] like throwing peas at a dry cowhide you
[32:45] know
[32:46] same way with God sometimes than us
[32:49] he speaks to us every once in a while
[32:51] used to when we were growing up in their
[32:54] baby form of our new birth
[32:57] he would speak to us a lot
[33:00] he rained on us a lot because the rain
[33:03] is the Holy Ghost does everybody
[33:04] understand the rain is a holy ghost all
[33:06] right that's what comes down from God
[33:07] out of Heaven that's what
[33:10] brings us to maturity without the Holy
[33:12] Ghost you're not even a plant that's
[33:14] right
[33:15] without the Holy Ghost you might be a
[33:17] weed plant but I'm not talking about the
[33:19] plant that we're talking about today
[33:21] you're not even a plant if you're not
[33:22] born again that's right all right
[33:24] because you've got to be in the family
[33:25] of God to be in the family of God you
[33:27] must be born again all right so we're
[33:30] going to read that the rain falls on the
[33:31] just in the end yes which is sure and
[33:34] that's what's happening in this day
[33:37] unless we can see let's break this down
[33:39] former and louder
[33:41] all right we read there in Joel that
[33:43] when he brought the former rain and then
[33:45] the latter rain
[33:47] now we're going to cover also that he
[33:49] brought those in the first month
[33:53] showing there would be a quick work
[33:56] to the daughters of Zion
[34:00] because there is absolutely no way you
[34:02] can plant something on January I mean on
[34:05] March the 1st and harvested on March the
[34:08] 31st or 30th no way
[34:11] physics I'm talking about naturally
[34:12] there's no natural way you can plant a
[34:15] uh tomato I don't care what it is 30
[34:18] days
[34:19] can't happen but with God everything's
[34:21] possible
[34:23] and God is going to send us the
[34:25] daughters of Zion he's going to send us
[34:27] a short quick work he's going to bring
[34:29] the former Reign which is the teaching
[34:31] rain if you bring that up now brother
[34:34] Bob which is the teaching ring and will
[34:37] bring the latter rain on that on in the
[34:40] same month
[34:43] 30 days from now
[34:48] wake up brother Bob
[34:49] there you go all right here is the
[34:53] Hebrew Lexington now brother Braden
[34:54] we're going to read quotes in just a
[34:55] minute
[34:57] but Strong's number 4175 is where
[34:59] brother Brown gets the word Moray
[35:02] m-o-r-e-h
[35:04] pronounced Moray which is the early
[35:07] reign
[35:08] or the teacher
[35:11] all right now pull up number two please
[35:15] the Vicky number two this is this is a
[35:20] I guess you might say a root word off of
[35:22] it
[35:24] cool go back down number two
[35:28] I like this when you control stuff
[35:30] but look what it's doing look at the
[35:32] ones to cast
[35:33] to point out show to direct teach or
[35:36] instruct
[35:38] to be watered
[35:40] everybody kind of got a visual former
[35:43] reign
[35:44] which is a the former means first the
[35:47] first ring that falls everybody
[35:49] understand
[35:50] and that means also the cast or to point
[35:53] out show to direct teacher instruct now
[35:55] go number three which is Ladder
[36:01] later range spring rain the March and
[36:04] April rains which mature the crops of
[36:07] Palestine now go number four
[36:11] to glean gather take the aftermath take
[36:15] everything I like that
[36:17] dude to spoil gather everything from our
[36:20] strip but to glean gather take the
[36:23] aftermath or take everything of what
[36:25] of what you planted in the former
[36:28] all right
[36:29] go out and plant your crop just like we
[36:32] was talking about this morning
[36:33] we're gonna go out maybe this
[36:35] later part of the week when it starts
[36:37] raining we're going to take some crop C
[36:39] and we're going to go over to the Hunt
[36:40] Club we're going to show those on the
[36:42] ground I know for sure that they're not
[36:44] going to be up and matured in a month
[36:46] but I know one day that if we planted
[36:49] something like corn one day we'll get a
[36:51] harvest from that is that correct right
[36:53] so God listen everything God does he
[36:56] does in stages
[36:59] he does not do that for him he does that
[37:02] for us
[37:04] because we don't understand and if he
[37:06] dumped everything on us we'd go crazy
[37:09] all right our crazy art
[37:12] so he gives us a form of rain now I want
[37:15] you to listen
[37:17] I'm going to read you a few quotes and I
[37:19] want you to listen
[37:21] to a prophet
[37:23] this may be hard for you to swallow
[37:27] when brother Branham preached that the
[37:29] white horse rider was the mighty
[37:30] conqueror preached him as the Holy Ghost
[37:32] in 1959 and actually some in 1960 he was
[37:36] preaching out of partial revelation
[37:42] correct
[37:43] but it was all he saw for the time
[37:46] but now listen
[37:49] God didn't like that
[37:52] in that he allowed Luther and all them
[37:55] the reformers
[37:57] to preach that the Holy Ghost and all
[38:00] these things were certain others you
[38:02] know father-son Holy Ghost baptism and
[38:04] hell was eternal and all these things
[38:06] like that and eating fruit in the garden
[38:08] but
[38:10] remember there was another age to come
[38:13] that could take that and and bring it
[38:16] higher
[38:18] everybody got that I'm being slow but I
[38:20] want you to be slow too okay listen
[38:23] all right then God took Wesley what was
[38:26] in Wesley's age and over into the
[38:29] Pentecostal age he brought a higher form
[38:32] of that same Holy Ghost
[38:35] Luther had the Holy Ghost Right Wesley
[38:37] at the Holy Ghost right
[38:39] boom was it different no it wasn't
[38:41] different but to them
[38:43] they only saw this much of light Luther
[38:45] Wesley saw this much Pentecost saw this
[38:48] much
[38:48] but God was not happy until he had
[38:53] perfect hair
[38:56] so brother Branham was preaching that
[38:58] white horse rider was the was the Holy
[39:01] Ghost and The Mighty conqueror and some
[39:03] on the church age book and also
[39:06] listen to a prophet we're going to bring
[39:09] up the first quote and look at the dates
[39:12] 1948
[39:16] now 1948
[39:19] brother Brown was speaking on the former
[39:22] ladder reign
[39:23] I'm gonna break it down to you pretty
[39:25] slow so just just bear with me now God
[39:27] promised that he was going to send a
[39:29] former Reign and a lettering and he
[39:31] promised a former and latter rain in the
[39:33] latter rain don't get confused just stay
[39:35] where you at in other words a double
[39:37] portion
[39:38] now what he's talking about is the
[39:40] former lettering coming in the same
[39:42] month
[39:43] everybody got that now former ladder
[39:45] rain coming in the same month all right
[39:48] a double portion in other words you're
[39:50] gonna get former ladder in 30 days right
[39:52] everybody got that say Amen all right so
[39:56] that's what he's saying in other words a
[39:57] double portion like the Garment of
[39:59] Elisha when Elijah dropped it Elisha
[40:01] picked up and had a double portion and
[40:03] remember Elisha is a type of the church
[40:06] and Elijah is a type of Christ right
[40:09] Christ was taken up in the same spirit
[40:11] that was upon Christ is on the church
[40:13] tonight the Holy Ghost and you know what
[40:15] I was thinking the other day
[40:19] when Elisha
[40:22] struck the Jordan with the mantle of
[40:25] Elijah
[40:27] what did he say
[40:29] he said where be the god of Elijah he
[40:34] didn't say where to be Elijah
[40:36] that's our problem people
[40:38] I start problem in the message we're
[40:40] looking for Elijah
[40:43] Elisha knew that Elijah went off the
[40:45] scene
[40:46] that's right
[40:48] so I'll Asha knew that he wasn't looking
[40:50] for Elijah to do what he was supposed to
[40:52] do he was looking for the same God that
[40:54] was in that Elijah to do what was needed
[40:56] to be done so he said where be the god
[40:58] of Elijah I say to you today we'll be
[41:00] the god of Elijah
[41:01] Elijah's gone
[41:04] but where be the god of Elijah
[41:09] because remember Elisha
[41:12] Elisha did twice as many miracles as
[41:15] Elijah did
[41:16] double portion right right I think
[41:19] Elijah did eight he did 16 something
[41:21] like that
[41:24] that's me and you that's right right
[41:26] that's you and I that sounds right Josh
[41:29] turn it down a little bit I'm loud
[41:30] enough
[41:32] but Elisha said where be the god of
[41:35] Elijah
[41:36] Christ was taken up
[41:39] so now
[41:41] if he was taken up gone off the scene
[41:43] then guess what happened
[41:45] a bride stepped on the scene in the end
[41:47] time I mean in the during the church
[41:49] ages now brother around him is this 1948
[41:51] go to the next one
[41:57] here's a prophet in partial realization
[42:00] because this is gonna sound contrave
[42:03] when I read you a quote in about four or
[42:05] five more quotes
[42:07] you're going to see something different
[42:09] but this is Brother Brown speaking
[42:12] about Divine Healing he's talking about
[42:15] all these other things
[42:16] and
[42:18] blue screens on the computer is not good
[42:21] no signal
[42:23] if you guys went to lunch
[42:27] I told him it was like two air traffic
[42:29] controllers back there over there trying
[42:31] to do this and do that
[42:32] he's on the railroad
[42:37] but look now this and he promised the
[42:39] former Atlanta Reign now we're living
[42:42] now have been for years under the latter
[42:45] rain
[42:49] that's not true
[42:52] as far as when we bring him up in 1962
[42:55] to the spoken words Original Seed and
[42:57] then Holy Spirit said pick up your pen
[42:59] and write
[43:01] he said you say latter rain later rain
[43:04] he said you haven't got the former yet
[43:07] but watch the prophet talking about he's
[43:09] not wrong in what he's saying
[43:13] go to the next one
[43:18] in the beginning when Pentecost fell it
[43:20] fell on the Jews and the Jewish Church
[43:22] died and the Gentile Church come in
[43:24] now you're picking up his thought
[43:27] of course there's not the same message
[43:28] but you're looking at this thought and
[43:30] what brother Brown's talking about and a
[43:32] gentile Church come in and then all
[43:33] signs and wonders ceased now notice that
[43:35] was the former reign
[43:38] then the church the Jewish church is
[43:40] returning just in the latter rain when
[43:42] the Holy Spirit is just being poured out
[43:43] again and the Jews now returning by the
[43:45] Thousand back to Palestine
[43:48] what am I trying to say if you read you
[43:51] what I try to do sometimes it's like
[43:53] brother Dale does I try to find a quote
[43:55] that looks contrary because one day
[43:57] you're going to come across it
[44:00] one day you're going to be reading the
[44:01] book you're going to say brother Brown
[44:03] said the former letter of English
[44:04] already over or that we're in the latter
[44:07] rain and it's 1950.
[44:10] and then you go reach Pokemon's Original
[44:11] Seed which says you don't even have a
[44:13] ladder rain yet former range just now
[44:16] falling
[44:17] but now look
[44:19] let's go from partial to perfect
[44:22] in partial realization
[44:25] the when Pentecost fell
[44:28] what did it fall on
[44:30] it fell on what Jesus showed in the
[44:33] disciples
[44:35] okay 120 in the upper room the Holy
[44:38] Ghost fell on what was already planted
[44:41] in their field that was former Reign
[44:44] teaching rain you're going to see that
[44:47] when brother Branham he didn't go back
[44:48] and try to repreach all this because
[44:50] this was really a foundation right
[44:53] all right
[44:55] you gonna find out we I threw this one
[44:58] away to keep from having so many quotes
[44:59] but he said John the Baptist
[45:02] so the form of rain
[45:04] then Jesus was the latter rain
[45:06] see so you can't just say what I'm
[45:08] trying to say today is you can't just
[45:10] say well former rain is just teaching it
[45:12] is
[45:14] or it's just this no I want to bring you
[45:17] back to the to the 48s to the 50s we're
[45:19] gonna go to the 60s and then we're going
[45:21] to go to 2011. because the former Reign
[45:24] has always been teaching
[45:26] because a lot of rain cannot fall
[45:30] just like I told you about the hunting
[45:33] club
[45:33] if I didn't plant no seed over there it
[45:35] wouldn't matter if it rained a thousand
[45:36] times
[45:38] all right he ain't gonna come up that's
[45:40] right because there's nothing in that
[45:41] field to come up
[45:42] so there had to be something planted
[45:44] there was something planted in those
[45:48] disciples and in beginning when
[45:51] Pentecost fell it fell on the Jews
[45:54] right with that 120 in the upper room
[45:57] why did it fall on it felt on it fell on
[46:00] the former ring or the teaching rain
[46:03] because what did God do God is we say
[46:06] well Harvest
[46:08] Harvest is a Rapture I know that
[46:13] but when Stephen died he was the first
[46:15] one martyred right Stephen back in back
[46:17] in the in the Old Testament I mean New
[46:19] Testament well that's really nice really
[46:21] the Old Testament but back in in uh in
[46:24] the book of Acts
[46:25] what happened to Stephen that wasn't the
[46:27] New Testament because he was born again
[46:29] um
[46:30] he was the first one harvested
[46:34] remember the song Stephen was the first
[46:35] one to die for this Holy Ghost plan he
[46:37] was the first one harvested
[46:40] partial Harvest
[46:44] this may be confusing you may have to do
[46:46] this again
[46:48] remember
[46:49] Luther had to Holy Ghost
[46:51] all the Holy Ghost he'll ever have and
[46:54] it's the same Holy Ghost you got today
[46:56] yeah it was impartial that's right
[46:59] all right
[47:00] so the Holy Ghost fell on their
[47:02] Pentecost in power and manifestation
[47:06] signs and wonders
[47:08] but they died
[47:10] it was partial right
[47:13] so they died part they played their part
[47:16] and then they went off the scene and God
[47:18] what God harvested
[47:20] his fruit
[47:23] because you're going to see one thing's
[47:24] for sure
[47:25] God is pleased
[47:28] to do that but that's not all that's not
[47:30] the perfect that God wants the perfect
[47:33] that God wants is is for you and I this
[47:35] fruit to walk off this Earth
[47:39] without death amen all right so now this
[47:42] is all impartial everything listen let
[47:45] me just put it this is plain everything
[47:48] from right where we're standing today
[47:52] back is partial right
[47:57] think about that
[48:00] except for Jesus
[48:02] except for Jesus he was perfect I'm
[48:05] talking about after he death burial
[48:07] Resurrection ascension come back under
[48:08] that Pentecost from Pentecostal now has
[48:11] been partial
[48:12] partial realization
[48:16] but that which is perfect that's why I
[48:18] ran this morning that which is perfect
[48:19] has come
[48:21] now we know God's the perfect one but he
[48:23] had to have a group of people to put
[48:25] that perfect in amen right man
[48:27] and they weren't sown yet
[48:32] because you're going to realize one
[48:34] thing's for sure
[48:37] brother Branham could see where he
[48:39] pulled up the next quote
[48:45] all right listen
[48:47] let's read this one
[48:49] now this is the church age book
[48:53] Church age book
[48:56] remember he preached the church a series
[48:57] in 1960
[49:00] but he didn't
[49:02] he didn't compile the church age book
[49:04] until like 64 or 60 right in that 64
[49:06] right
[49:07] so he's already preached spoken words
[49:10] Original Seed listen to what he's saying
[49:12] now this age started just after the turn
[49:14] of the 20th century
[49:15] as it was to be the age in which the
[49:18] true church
[49:19] not that they were all false
[49:23] right
[49:24] true mature
[49:27] the mature Church
[49:30] everybody all right with that
[49:32] you say true then that's where people go
[49:34] well are they amongst the rest of them
[49:36] have been false no in which the true
[49:39] church would return to being the bride
[49:41] she was at Pentecost we know that there
[49:44] must be necessant necessity be a return
[49:46] of dynamic power the believer sensed
[49:48] this in the spirit began crying to God
[49:50] for a new outpouring such as within the
[49:51] first century what seemed to me the
[49:53] answer came as many began to speak in
[49:55] tongues of manifestation manifest gifts
[49:57] of the Spirit
[49:59] it was then believe that this was indeed
[50:01] a long-awaited restoration now I
[50:04] couldn't get a quote to interject in
[50:06] that but if you'll look back and I can't
[50:09] remember it but you can pull it up on a
[50:11] computer brother Branham starts talking
[50:14] about a latter rain movement
[50:17] there was a group of people come out
[50:19] Assemblies of God come out in a ladder
[50:21] rain movement
[50:23] they started prophesying and he said
[50:25] well they he said they said they were
[50:27] all prophets he said they weren't all
[50:29] prophets he said they began to
[50:30] prophesize well therefore they called
[50:32] them prophets he said but they were not
[50:34] loud rain he said they really didn't
[50:35] know what they were talking about but
[50:37] see that's what he's talking about right
[50:38] here
[50:39] what seemed to be the answer
[50:42] came as many began to speak in tongues
[50:44] and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was
[50:46] then believed that this was indeed the
[50:47] long-await of restoration
[50:49] it was not
[50:51] for the latter rain can come only after
[50:54] the former Reign which is the spring or
[50:57] teaching reign
[50:59] the latter rain then is the Harvest rain
[51:02] how could this be the real thing when
[51:04] the teaching rain had not come
[51:07] excuse me the prophet messenger who was
[51:10] to be sent to teach the people
[51:12] who's he talking about
[51:14] himself that's right
[51:17] the prophet messenger who was to be sent
[51:19] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[51:20] of the children back and Pentecostal
[51:22] fathers had not
[51:23] yet come thus that was thought to be the
[51:26] restoration and found quickening until
[51:27] the Rapture had not come unto the
[51:29] Rapture had not come
[51:32] and it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[51:34] partaking of spiritual blessings
[51:37] and manifestations of the Holy Spirit
[51:38] we're going to read one quote maybe in a
[51:40] minute if I didn't cut it out I had to
[51:41] cut some of these out for time
[51:43] but brother Brown said you plan a
[51:46] denominational seed and the Holy Ghost
[51:48] fell so you're going to in other words
[51:49] you're going to harvest your
[51:50] nominational
[51:51] right Harvest all right
[51:55] that's why that's why that that brother
[51:57] Brandon when I say brother Brown had to
[51:59] come it was Jesus Christ in in brother
[52:01] Brown you know that because he was the
[52:03] prophet the Lord Jesus Christ come back
[52:05] through the messenger speaking to us to
[52:08] get us back in line let's go to the next
[52:10] one
[52:12] we're still in the church age book
[52:16] we'll read Joel in a minute go down to
[52:18] the to the yellow the Lutheran age did
[52:20] not restore the church
[52:22] they started a Reformation
[52:25] the Wesleyan age did not restore this
[52:27] one we read this morning or close to it
[52:28] the Pentecostal age did not restore but
[52:31] God has to restore for he cannot deny
[52:33] his word this is not the resurrection of
[52:36] the church it is the restoration God
[52:38] will take the church right back to
[52:40] Pentecost
[52:41] of the beginning now down at the bottom
[52:43] he is doing it and stated in verse 23 by
[52:45] the teaching or former Reign next will
[52:47] come to harvest rain or
[52:50] rap drink fade so now
[52:53] go to the next one let's see what it is
[52:56] excuse me
[52:59] here's how we're going to put it all
[53:00] together right here
[53:03] 1963 once more New York
[53:06] each one becomes a latter rain to the
[53:09] other
[53:10] for preaching on the church age brother
[53:12] around talk to the leftover
[53:14] right that you didn't have just an age
[53:17] end and the age begin if you really draw
[53:19] those circles they would be like almost
[53:20] you know they would be a small amount
[53:24] over to the other well that's kind of
[53:26] what's happened with the former rain and
[53:28] lateran look what it says each one
[53:30] becomes a ladder range to the other
[53:33] Luther was a ladder Reign to the
[53:35] Catholic
[53:40] he took Catholic teaching
[53:45] come over into his message
[53:48] God quickened the part that he needed
[53:50] the just shall lived by faith but he
[53:51] still had a lot of the Catholic ideas is
[53:53] that correct yes right all right so that
[53:55] was a lap over just like in the church
[53:57] ages
[53:58] and John Wesley was the lateran to
[54:00] Luther he took Luther's teaching
[54:05] didn't stay on Luther's teaching he
[54:07] built on Luther's teaching
[54:10] that stair step that comes up that stair
[54:13] step comes up and the next level of
[54:15] stairs sits right down on top of the
[54:16] bottom one
[54:18] same way with with this so brother Brown
[54:20] could be right he is right I didn't I
[54:22] didn't mean to say it was wrong but he
[54:24] was right when he said that the former
[54:26] lettering was falling it fell all down
[54:28] Through the Ages
[54:30] Luther's message gave over to Wesley
[54:34] Wesley was a ladder rain
[54:37] actually was the latter rain to Luther
[54:39] so what Luther was the former teaching
[54:43] Wesley was the latter the Harvest
[54:46] all right
[54:47] because he had leftovers in the ages and
[54:51] God harvested what he harvested Luther's
[54:54] Doctrine
[54:58] he harvested what Luther what was
[55:00] quickened to Luther the good harvested
[55:02] that group of people
[55:04] the Pentecost was the latter rain to the
[55:06] denomination
[55:07] in other words John Wesley
[55:09] now the Pentecostals are organized now
[55:12] what's
[55:13] going to happen CCC listen to this next
[55:17] one I didn't have it highlighted but I
[55:18] read it back there in the back and I
[55:19] think I read it the children of God
[55:21] never drove their state tents down so
[55:23] tight that what they couldn't pull it up
[55:25] remember when the pillar fire move they
[55:27] got up moved with it right what happened
[55:29] was Luther God was pleased with Luther
[55:31] pleased with his teaching and there was
[55:34] a harvest of that age but they cabbage
[55:38] down and become a denomination and God
[55:40] said I'm moving
[55:42] right what they've done is they put
[55:44] their states down too far in the ground
[55:46] and didn't move
[55:48] right the children of Israel never put
[55:49] their Stakes down too far because
[55:51] remember when that pillow fire moved
[55:52] they had a certain length of time they
[55:54] didn't have 14 to 15 days or even two
[55:56] three days as soon as that pillar fire
[55:58] got ready to move
[56:00] they moved with it amen right and the
[56:02] pillow fire moves right out it leaves
[56:04] them sitting there just goes right on
[56:06] they're so straight down so they can't
[56:08] move
[56:09] but then there's many fine-hearted
[56:10] people
[56:11] they got caught in the nomination
[56:14] you and I got caught into nomination all
[56:16] right now let's go to the next one we'll
[56:19] get some right here real quick and then
[56:20] I'll make some more comments I said
[56:22] latter rain I said Ms McPherson you know
[56:24] who he's talking about Amy simple
[56:25] McPherson of the Foursquare Church was
[56:28] Lata rain too she was
[56:30] she was the latter of rain to the
[56:32] assemblies
[56:34] she was the Harvest of what the
[56:36] assemblies had planted she became come
[56:38] out of it became a harvest of that
[56:40] Luther was a later in the Catholic
[56:42] Baptist was Atlanta Reign to Luther
[56:44] Methodist was a lot of rain to them the
[56:46] Pentecostals the latter rain to the
[56:47] Nazarene ladder rain later rain what is
[56:49] it when the church gets organized and
[56:52] sit down home and just a big bunch of
[56:53] cold statues then the Holy Ghost moves
[56:55] out and starts a lot of rain what is it
[56:59] a movement or a harvest rain all right
[57:01] go number seven
[57:03] now watch
[57:05] here's where
[57:07] on the Pokemon's original seat this is
[57:09] where we need to get to
[57:11] so far that was pretty quick I'm sorry
[57:14] but
[57:16] former rain
[57:18] is teaching right later rain is the
[57:21] Harvest of that teaching range
[57:24] pretty simple
[57:26] what Luther talk what Luther planted in
[57:29] those people God harvested all right
[57:31] under Wesley the same way everybody so
[57:33] there's been even up to Amy simple
[57:36] McPherson
[57:39] and um
[57:41] trying to think of some of the other
[57:42] ones back during that time but those
[57:44] people had heart had had a former are
[57:46] teaching reign
[57:48] but now watch in 1962
[57:52] just my belief uh do you believe if you
[57:56] want to or study it out when brother
[57:57] Brown preached the statue of a perfect
[57:59] man in 1961 he really began to start
[58:02] preaching his message we know his
[58:03] message came into seals in 1963 but as
[58:07] any message there is a
[58:09] former
[58:11] our teaching right
[58:14] you and I could not understand 63 to 65
[58:18] if we don't have 47 to 63 so don't start
[58:22] that uh well we only need 1963 and above
[58:26] uh but I don't think so
[58:28] that's right because you got to have the
[58:30] former rain
[58:31] the teaching reign
[58:34] now watch now remember the word Mori
[58:36] which we pulled it up means teaching the
[58:39] the form of rain
[58:41] it says the more a rain the teaching
[58:43] rain teaching rain went forth Billy
[58:45] Graham has struck the world
[58:48] teaching
[58:50] Pentecostal struck the world
[58:53] what their Doctrine and the word has
[58:55] struck the world
[58:58] God had showed him he was preaching the
[59:00] message
[59:01] now watch the matter now
[59:03] she is now waiting for the latter rain
[59:05] that's when she produces her fruit oh I
[59:09] hope you get her
[59:11] all right go to 7A
[59:14] this is in 1962 after he preached spoken
[59:19] words Regional seat I just thought I'd
[59:20] put this in because watch this if you
[59:23] notice that word there in the Hebrew
[59:25] former and latter rain former Ray means
[59:27] a sowing rain
[59:30] teaching and sewing is the same thing
[59:32] what do you do when you teach the word
[59:34] of God you're sowing a seed I'm sowing a
[59:36] seed right now some of it's falling on
[59:39] dry ground
[59:40] some of it's falling on sleepy ground
[59:44] and then when the spirit Falls it falls
[59:46] on the just and the unjust
[59:49] what you talking about now the latter
[59:51] rain something's going to fall all right
[59:53] if we've so denominational seeds we just
[59:57] reap the denominational
[59:59] Harvest that's what we've done the
[1:00:02] Baptist took a million more 44 and hard
[1:00:04] tell what they are now after the great
[1:00:05] Evangelist Billy Graham and many of them
[1:00:07] had slept look at our Pentecost through
[1:00:09] the war robbers Tommy Osmond and great
[1:00:10] men like that they had a teaching or
[1:00:13] form of rain and then there was a
[1:00:15] harvest
[1:00:17] all right let's just stop right there
[1:00:19] for a second
[1:00:21] so so far brother Branham has has been
[1:00:26] teaching in a partial application
[1:00:30] that's hard to say because many say well
[1:00:34] well he was he was perfect he was no he
[1:00:38] was partial
[1:00:40] his partial teaching was 47-63.
[1:00:44] that was his partial
[1:00:48] and frankly if we don't get 63 to 65
[1:00:50] that's the partial it's actually left up
[1:00:53] to you and me
[1:00:54] to decide which one is which
[1:00:57] that's my whole point today we can take
[1:00:59] this thing on to the to the god brother
[1:01:01] Nick said I agree 100 percent
[1:01:04] why not until my last breath I'm going
[1:01:06] to be the one in live in a minute that's
[1:01:08] alive and remain
[1:01:10] but you're not just going to be there
[1:01:11] because you're standing in little church
[1:01:14] right you're not going to be there
[1:01:16] because you've read 24 books a day
[1:01:21] or you memorize the Bible yes
[1:01:24] yes or you're good
[1:01:27] I tell you what you think I'm hard
[1:01:28] sometimes never read Jesus when he went
[1:01:30] into the temple
[1:01:32] I've never called anybody hypocrite to
[1:01:34] their faith
[1:01:36] but he sure did
[1:01:37] he call them snakes he told him he said
[1:01:40] you're not like my daddy we're from a
[1:01:43] whole different family now buddy walk in
[1:01:46] a message church and tell somebody like
[1:01:48] that say hey my daddy and your daddy
[1:01:50] ain't the same
[1:01:52] you're a hypocrite
[1:01:54] but you think I'm bad
[1:01:58] Jesus told them all he said
[1:02:01] your generation
[1:02:03] is dead
[1:02:05] eternally separated from God and that
[1:02:09] what he said he said it they said well
[1:02:11] we we got Abraham
[1:02:13] we got Moses we got this quotebook
[1:02:17] they did they had the Torah the five you
[1:02:20] know first five books of the Bible
[1:02:21] That's Moses cookbook
[1:02:23] you know we carry quote books all around
[1:02:25] with us lamb Moses quote book he said
[1:02:27] yeah
[1:02:28] and he said here of your father the
[1:02:31] devil and the ones in that age are all
[1:02:34] dead and eternally separated from me
[1:02:39] when are we going to get down to where
[1:02:40] we get down to that
[1:02:43] that's when I think you're going to see
[1:02:45] people walk out the door
[1:02:50] denominational Harvest
[1:02:53] that's what brother Brown was dealing
[1:02:54] with
[1:02:55] let me be honest with you the way I see
[1:02:58] it
[1:02:59] up until that's why 1977 was a very
[1:03:03] important
[1:03:04] place and I'm just going to stick this
[1:03:05] in and I'll leave it
[1:03:07] 1977 was a dispensational change
[1:03:12] up until 1977 even brother Branham with
[1:03:16] the great ones like Billy Graham or
[1:03:18] Robert even FF Bosworth called him the
[1:03:21] father of our faith in this time
[1:03:24] he still took father son Holy Ghost he
[1:03:26] couldn't see the message
[1:03:28] never saw the message that I know of
[1:03:31] as far as the way we see the message
[1:03:34] but he was born in that age
[1:03:37] he got the former Reign for whoever he
[1:03:39] got it from
[1:03:40] and then God harvested that latter rain
[1:03:43] of what he had took in God quickened
[1:03:46] everything that FF Bosworth knew now
[1:03:47] brother Brown said if Bosworth could tie
[1:03:49] you up in notch
[1:03:51] on faith and Divine Healing that was his
[1:03:54] purpose Smith Wigglesworth never met
[1:03:57] William Branham but he's a born-again
[1:03:58] believer
[1:04:00] actually he died
[1:04:02] and the next day brother Brown the angel
[1:04:04] met brother Brown in 1947 Smith
[1:04:07] woofworth died the day before so she has
[1:04:09] always got somebody on the scene he's
[1:04:11] always got somebody doing the work but
[1:04:13] now you can't say what Smith what was
[1:04:15] worth was was wrong
[1:04:17] but it was partial
[1:04:19] Billy Graham was partial Oral Roberts
[1:04:22] was partial
[1:04:23] Joshua I don't understand about Billy
[1:04:25] Graham and Oral Roberts they never saw
[1:04:28] the message in the hour but brother
[1:04:29] Brown said they were two prophets to
[1:04:31] Sodom
[1:04:32] to call out a people
[1:04:36] and condemn that age right
[1:04:39] said Billy Graham had the Holy Ghost
[1:04:43] but they never accepted brother Reynolds
[1:04:45] message why
[1:04:53] you said well a denominationalism will
[1:04:55] take you straight to hell
[1:04:58] be careful guys that's right
[1:05:01] be careful
[1:05:03] be real careful amen all right
[1:05:06] but now I want to tell you something's
[1:05:07] for sure though after 1977
[1:05:10] God don't wink at a lot of ignorance
[1:05:12] like he used to all right right after
[1:05:14] 1977 something did change the
[1:05:16] dispensation of the Gentile of this
[1:05:18] bride people got to digging in this
[1:05:21] message and we got to really get in the
[1:05:22] real Harvest out of this thing all right
[1:05:25] so God went to our ignorance there's
[1:05:27] always a lap over all right brother
[1:05:30] random was preaching partial realization
[1:05:33] but you know what we're supposed to do
[1:05:35] we're supposed to glean the perfect out
[1:05:37] of all of it
[1:05:38] right but
[1:05:40] take it on yeah exactly
[1:05:43] see he come and brought this right here
[1:05:46] and the quotes from 47 to 63 a lot of
[1:05:48] people in the message don't even read
[1:05:49] them
[1:05:50] but inside brother Brown didn't say it
[1:05:52] in the books and tapes after 63 lives
[1:05:54] Rapture and Faith he said in these books
[1:05:57] and tapes lies rapturing Faith so from
[1:06:00] 47 to 63 somewhere in there out of that
[1:06:03] partial
[1:06:04] God's gonna bring a perfect down to that
[1:06:06] partial
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:09] okay
[1:06:11] former Reign we got the teaching
[1:06:14] there's no more teaching to come
[1:06:16] there's no more different message to
[1:06:18] come
[1:06:19] all right he's got to come out of what
[1:06:21] we've already got
[1:06:22] it that's why we do it that's why I
[1:06:24] think it's wonderful we don't have to
[1:06:26] look for anything else to come that's
[1:06:28] right it's already come
[1:06:30] it's already here
[1:06:31] rapturing Faith lives in abortion tapes
[1:06:35] are what the Harvest
[1:06:38] of what this Prophet brought us
[1:06:41] from a partial understanding to a
[1:06:43] perfect understanding
[1:06:45] all right and in your journey like I
[1:06:47] said this morning
[1:06:48] in our journey
[1:06:50] you're going to start it partially
[1:06:54] and some people are going to stay at
[1:06:57] partial
[1:06:59] but somebody's going to come to perfect
[1:07:01] realization
[1:07:03] somebody's gonna why
[1:07:06] because there's a lot of rain to fall in
[1:07:09] the end times right old Daughters of
[1:07:12] Zion
[1:07:14] in other words perk your ears up because
[1:07:16] I'm talking to you
[1:07:18] I'm not talking to Israel I'm talking to
[1:07:21] you I'm not talking to the Baptist I'm
[1:07:24] not talking to the Methodist I'm talking
[1:07:25] to you
[1:07:27] right now pull up the next one please
[1:07:35] now this is back on spoken words
[1:07:37] Regional sea
[1:07:39] this is what brother random is doing now
[1:07:40] and what they're trying to do they're
[1:07:43] trying to manufacture a lot of rain
[1:07:45] nonsense
[1:07:48] you can't manufacture right
[1:07:51] rain
[1:07:55] have we ever as smart as we are
[1:07:58] and as advanced as we are Manchester
[1:08:01] never made rain
[1:08:04] man can't make rain
[1:08:06] man can't make this spiritual rain
[1:08:10] sure they try
[1:08:12] nonsense why the latter rain will sweep
[1:08:14] the world brother been a former range
[1:08:17] showing words
[1:08:22] showing words
[1:08:26] if that word's not quickened though with
[1:08:28] that line of rain
[1:08:30] you're not gonna have a harvest
[1:08:32] we just become let me put that in there
[1:08:35] um been a former range throwing words
[1:08:39] but if there's not a ladder ain't on
[1:08:40] that it's just words right
[1:08:43] quotes Moses's quote book
[1:08:45] that's right
[1:08:47] now you'll see what the latter rain
[1:08:49] produces you'll find out they'll be on
[1:08:51] affiliation the Pentecostals and all the
[1:08:53] groups will come together and they'll
[1:08:55] shut the doors on them guys that won't
[1:08:56] listen to it you won't even be allowed
[1:08:59] to open your mouth right that's when
[1:09:01] he'll come that's when he'll show that's
[1:09:04] when you'll see a rain oh my lay still
[1:09:06] be quiet uh-huh Let It Go oh
[1:09:10] know the next one
[1:09:13] here he's praying
[1:09:16] spoken words originally see the same
[1:09:18] message
[1:09:19] he's praying gracious Heavenly Father
[1:09:21] we're not trying to bring the meat into
[1:09:22] a close
[1:09:23] this was actually the first message
[1:09:25] remember everybody came back about two
[1:09:27] or three o'clock for the second message
[1:09:28] it was about six hour sermon
[1:09:30] now we pray father that these seeds that
[1:09:32] sown will be laying waiting
[1:09:35] for the latter rain to fall waiting they
[1:09:38] that wait upon the Lord they shall renew
[1:09:39] their strength God may we not run ahead
[1:09:42] of the word state with the word
[1:09:44] Granite Lord
[1:09:47] that's what the problem is
[1:09:50] some have run way ahead
[1:09:53] and not waited on God
[1:09:56] but now what's happening
[1:09:59] brother Brown has preached and sewed the
[1:10:01] word down
[1:10:02] all right let's go to number nine
[1:10:04] well this is what the Holy Spirit told
[1:10:06] him
[1:10:08] right here listen
[1:10:10] God has promised be careful God has
[1:10:13] promised Malachi 4 for the last day and
[1:10:15] Malachi 4 has not yet has been fulfilled
[1:10:17] but it must be fulfilled for it is a
[1:10:20] dramatized word of God spoken through
[1:10:23] Malachi of the Prophet Jesus referred to
[1:10:25] it it is to be just before the coming of
[1:10:27] Christ the second coming listen close
[1:10:29] now all scripture that has not been
[1:10:31] fulfilled must be before that time the
[1:10:35] Bible is to be finished to be finished
[1:10:37] the Gentile dispensation is to be
[1:10:39] finished with the church age when this
[1:10:41] anointed messenger arrives of course he
[1:10:43] will plant the seed of the entire Bible
[1:10:46] that was Luther's problem
[1:10:48] he didn't show the word of the entire
[1:10:50] Bible he showed the word just shall live
[1:10:52] by faith Wesley sowed sanctification
[1:10:56] cleansing set aside for service of
[1:10:58] course he will plant the seed of the
[1:11:00] entire Bible Plum from the serpent to
[1:11:02] the messenger in the former reign
[1:11:05] then he will be rejected by the
[1:11:07] denominational people as his forefather
[1:11:09] John and Elijah as was spoken by our
[1:11:12] Lord
[1:11:12] people as Elijah was the first time to
[1:11:15] ahab's time it will happen here in this
[1:11:17] country as this country is a type of
[1:11:20] Israel
[1:11:21] all right go to Lemon
[1:11:25] still on the spoken Orange Regional seed
[1:11:30] he said I'm going to visit you know
[1:11:31] where's that is in Sarah he's at the
[1:11:33] he's at close to the body chain I'm
[1:11:35] going to visit you I the personal
[1:11:36] pronoun I'm going to visit you according
[1:11:38] to the time of life oh and you're going
[1:11:40] to have that baby that you've waited on
[1:11:42] the latter rain is fixing to fall you've
[1:11:45] held that seed in there long enough now
[1:11:47] on believing
[1:11:49] On Believing
[1:11:56] I mean the the one this morning we were
[1:11:59] talking about was uh
[1:12:01] was uh partial
[1:12:04] and it was doubt
[1:12:06] now when I'm saying Abraham had that
[1:12:07] baby if they had doubted
[1:12:09] I don't think so
[1:12:11] the latter rain is fixing to fall you've
[1:12:13] held that seed in there long enough now
[1:12:14] on believing and you're looking for a
[1:12:17] coming son and he's coming amen that's
[1:12:18] the real church today see that elected
[1:12:21] seed you've been looking for him I'm
[1:12:22] going to send him to you amen what said
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:27] who was it
[1:12:29] the word which was who Melchizedek
[1:12:33] a preacher
[1:12:35] a priest
[1:12:39] a priest
[1:12:40] Melchizedek brought the word to Abram
[1:12:45] or Abraham he's told him you know he
[1:12:46] changed his name all right let's go to
[1:12:48] the name let's get the quotes out of the
[1:12:49] way
[1:12:51] same way spoken word is reasonable seed
[1:12:53] this is where brother Brown the holy
[1:12:55] spirit said pick up your pen right so at
[1:12:57] this time in this country that that
[1:12:58] person will appear for its in scripture
[1:13:00] and it's thus saith the Lord then in the
[1:13:02] latter rain they will come forth a Mount
[1:13:04] Carmel Showdown
[1:13:06] Bible fulfilled to the letter
[1:13:08] John the Baptist his messenger before
[1:13:10] his face in Malachi 3 planted a former
[1:13:12] Reign and was rejected by the churches
[1:13:14] the denominations the Pharisees and said
[1:13:16] the season is dead Jesus came and had
[1:13:19] Mount Transfiguration
[1:13:21] Showdown
[1:13:23] this Forerunner of the last day was so
[1:13:25] for the former Reign now what's that
[1:13:27] teaching
[1:13:28] in other words he's going to sow the
[1:13:29] word so that we can understand it so
[1:13:32] that when the latter rain comes that's
[1:13:33] what John done John and Malachi 3 see
[1:13:36] that's not brother Brown that's John the
[1:13:37] Baptist
[1:13:39] Malachi 3 sowed the seed so that Jesus
[1:13:43] could come
[1:13:45] all right the Holy Ghost himself
[1:13:47] right not not another person the Holy
[1:13:50] Ghost themselves all right
[1:13:52] Planet a former Reign was rejected by
[1:13:54] the churches which was who
[1:13:55] John the Baptist Jesus came and had a
[1:13:59] mount Transfiguration Showdown this
[1:14:01] Forerunner the last day well so for the
[1:14:03] former Reign Jesus Will Be The Showdown
[1:14:05] now he didn't say to the messenger
[1:14:09] only one true Messenger will point you
[1:14:11] to that man right to you right he'll
[1:14:13] never point you to himself he'll point
[1:14:16] you to Christ every time Jesus will be
[1:14:18] the showdown between denominations and
[1:14:20] Creeds which is his word when he comes a
[1:14:23] showdown the Rapture of his pride the
[1:14:25] first was Mount Carmel now what was
[1:14:27] Mount Carmel
[1:14:29] what happened on Mount Carmel
[1:14:34] a bunch of preachers got killed I think
[1:14:39] we could get into that but we're not
[1:14:42] but 200 and some preachers got killed
[1:14:44] that day
[1:14:45] and Elijah 400 and Elijah
[1:14:50] was on the mountain he said it God be
[1:14:53] God right yeah let Fire Fall yes if it
[1:14:59] not be the god
[1:15:01] then of course they you know what
[1:15:02] they've done but that was the first
[1:15:04] Showdown
[1:15:05] it was the Elijah Minnesota
[1:15:08] first Elijah
[1:15:10] the denominations of that
[1:15:13] day they had a what a showdown
[1:15:17] Jesus came and had a mount
[1:15:19] Transfiguration Showdown
[1:15:21] that was not physical where he killed a
[1:15:24] bunch of preachers but what did he do he
[1:15:27] was transfigured he was glorified
[1:15:31] and Jesus
[1:15:33] was adopted
[1:15:36] on map Transfiguration
[1:15:38] all right so you've got
[1:15:41] you've got Elijah
[1:15:44] had to deal with the denomination
[1:15:47] you got Jesus
[1:15:49] was dealing with
[1:15:51] I mean yeah we got
[1:15:53] um sorry we got Elijah dealing with the
[1:15:55] denominations and having a physical
[1:15:56] killing
[1:15:58] all right you've got the you got Jesus
[1:16:00] now dealing with a spiritual aspect on
[1:16:02] Mount Transfiguration where God showed
[1:16:05] and said this is my beloved Son and whom
[1:16:06] I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him now
[1:16:09] this Forerunner the last day he's gonna
[1:16:12] have to do all these
[1:16:14] he had death
[1:16:17] denominations he had the he had the form
[1:16:19] he had this one
[1:16:21] the second was Mount Transfiguration he
[1:16:24] didn't get changed but he's showing us
[1:16:25] how to get chains and the third would be
[1:16:27] Mount Zion who's the daughters of Zion
[1:16:29] and brother Brown said that would be the
[1:16:30] change of the body
[1:16:32] oh actually that's what we're looking at
[1:16:33] now in this latter rain that we're
[1:16:37] supposed to say
[1:16:39] um come or is coming but
[1:16:43] it says then in the latter rain that
[1:16:45] will come forth a Mount Carmel a
[1:16:48] showdown
[1:16:51] form of rain let's break it down then
[1:16:53] we'll be done former rain is a teaching
[1:16:55] rain that's what you when you become a
[1:16:57] Christian you started in partial
[1:16:59] realization and you begun to what listen
[1:17:02] to the word of God as the word of God
[1:17:04] became a part of your life that took you
[1:17:07] from partial heading toward Perfect
[1:17:10] all right when the Holy Ghost fell into
[1:17:13] that Pentecost it fell on a group of
[1:17:15] people then
[1:17:16] the perfect realization in their in
[1:17:18] their time for their time but it was
[1:17:20] partial realization for all that God's
[1:17:23] talking about in the Bible
[1:17:24] everybody understand that say Amen tell
[1:17:28] me some of you are asleep
[1:17:30] all right but down through the church
[1:17:33] ages
[1:17:34] it was partial realization
[1:17:39] for Paul
[1:17:42] but what he preached
[1:17:45] was perfect
[1:17:48] right that's right what Luther had was
[1:17:51] partial but what he preached for his
[1:17:53] time was perfect
[1:17:56] God harvested that that was his latter
[1:17:59] rain right
[1:18:01] got it yeah comes to God harvested he
[1:18:04] took he took he took the you know I I've
[1:18:07] always said the Bible says we plant them
[1:18:10] in corruption and that's what we have to
[1:18:11] do the reason of the Fall brother Benny
[1:18:13] the reason the fall reason we're burying
[1:18:16] people God didn't curse Adam
[1:18:18] he cursed the Earth that's right
[1:18:21] so you got the Earth
[1:18:22] our bodies come out of that Earth from
[1:18:25] thus Thou Art
[1:18:27] dust you shall return
[1:18:29] so we're planting them in corruption
[1:18:32] but they'll that seed that's been
[1:18:35] planted if it's a true sea of God not
[1:18:38] true like we're talking about that true
[1:18:40] is going to take alive and remain but
[1:18:42] they were a true seed of God for their
[1:18:43] time
[1:18:46] we planted him in the Earth
[1:18:49] but you'll never see that again
[1:18:53] that plant
[1:18:55] or that seed that was planted many years
[1:18:58] ago as an as a new birth it grew in that
[1:19:01] man
[1:19:02] it just never went to a perfect
[1:19:04] realization but now
[1:19:06] when he comes back the next time we see
[1:19:09] him
[1:19:10] the reason of all the teaching and the
[1:19:12] purpose of all the teaching was that the
[1:19:14] next time we see Tom far Bush he's going
[1:19:17] to be in
[1:19:18] young plant that's right
[1:19:21] he's going to be a young person he's
[1:19:23] going to be Eternal Body Spirit and soul
[1:19:25] the last time we saw brother Tom we saw
[1:19:28] a partial
[1:19:29] we saw a man that was broken down we saw
[1:19:32] a man that was getting old couldn't hear
[1:19:34] couldn't see
[1:19:36] because that Earth has been cursed
[1:19:40] but now people in the end time
[1:19:44] the change of the body is not so far
[1:19:49] that we can't get to it that's right
[1:19:53] because we've come to realize that the
[1:19:55] third stage of adoption is not the
[1:19:57] change of the body is to understand
[1:19:59] that's right that's right the change in
[1:20:01] the body and when you understand
[1:20:02] something guess what that takes out
[1:20:05] doubt Joe Parker was gone we're into
[1:20:08] perfect now
[1:20:11] see so whatever you have the word of God
[1:20:13] if you're sitting here today and you
[1:20:14] thought well I don't know what form of
[1:20:16] rain means
[1:20:17] that's partial
[1:20:19] but if you understand now that now I can
[1:20:23] read and if brother Brown says this and
[1:20:25] this and this you say well well that was
[1:20:27] partial understanding
[1:20:32] Luther partial understanding
[1:20:35] but perfect for his time right when
[1:20:38] you're born again partial realization
[1:20:43] but perfect first time right
[1:20:45] but we the problem is is we don't we
[1:20:48] can't go and throw it to another age we
[1:20:51] can't throw it to tomorrow
[1:20:54] I am let's go to Joel
[1:20:57] pull that up and we'll if you don't have
[1:20:59] to go to it we're going to read this
[1:21:01] we always read Joel 2 22-26
[1:21:05] let's see what God's really
[1:21:09] listen to this
[1:21:11] I want you to put this in in your words
[1:21:16] blow the trumpet enzyme so where is he
[1:21:21] where's Zion
[1:21:23] always speaks to the bride daughter's
[1:21:26] design whatever you want to call it but
[1:21:27] that comes in time
[1:21:28] below the trumpet enzymes sanctify fast
[1:21:31] call a solemn assembly gather the people
[1:21:36] sanctify the light
[1:21:39] we had that this morning
[1:21:43] another boy
[1:21:45] came up here right and said what was on
[1:21:47] his heart
[1:21:48] I hope that did that to the congregation
[1:21:52] gather the people sanctify the
[1:21:54] congregation assemble the elders gather
[1:21:58] the children
[1:22:00] and those that suck the breast let the
[1:22:03] bridegroom go forth of his chamber and
[1:22:05] to brine out of her closet
[1:22:07] what was I talking about this morning
[1:22:09] the actress watch them they're all
[1:22:12] moving toward the play they're all
[1:22:14] moving toward the stage
[1:22:16] let the priests
[1:22:18] the Ministers of the
[1:22:21] Altar and let him them say
[1:22:25] that's what I say before I leave any
[1:22:29] Minister's office and come and speak to
[1:22:32] you or anybody else around this country
[1:22:34] I lift my hands and I say Lord
[1:22:38] the lobby of Castaway and you throw me
[1:22:40] into hell
[1:22:43] say something through me and help
[1:22:46] somebody here
[1:22:49] and I and I mean that
[1:22:51] the idea Castaway though God never used
[1:22:53] me again
[1:22:54] that's what the minister say spare thy
[1:22:56] people O Lord
[1:22:58] and give not the inheritage
[1:23:01] to reproach
[1:23:05] that means live a clean life
[1:23:07] that the heathens should rule over them
[1:23:09] what what's heathen
[1:23:11] this thing right here is heathen
[1:23:14] so watch how he's building this thing up
[1:23:17] wherefore should they say among the
[1:23:19] people
[1:23:21] where is their God
[1:23:25] then will the Lord be
[1:23:27] jealous
[1:23:28] of his land and pity his people
[1:23:32] yea the Lord will answer and say unto
[1:23:34] his people behold I will send you
[1:23:39] mature
[1:23:41] fruit
[1:23:45] what's wine and oil
[1:23:48] Holy Ghost
[1:23:49] and you shall be satisfied therewith and
[1:23:54] I will no more make you a reproach among
[1:23:56] the healing
[1:23:57] look at all these eyes but I will remove
[1:24:00] far off from you the northern Army and
[1:24:03] will drive him into a land Barren and
[1:24:05] desolate
[1:24:06] with his face toward the EC and his
[1:24:09] hinder part toward the utmost sea and
[1:24:11] his stink shall come up and his ill
[1:24:14] savior shall come up because he hath
[1:24:17] done great things
[1:24:18] fear not a land be glad and rejoice for
[1:24:22] the Lord will do great things
[1:24:24] Be not Afraid you Beasts of the field
[1:24:29] for the pastors of the Wilderness do
[1:24:31] spring
[1:24:34] Harvest Time right for the tree beareth
[1:24:37] her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do
[1:24:40] yield their strength be glad then you
[1:24:43] children of zine and rejoice in the Lord
[1:24:45] your God for he has given you the former
[1:24:47] Reign moderately
[1:24:50] that means a lot of teaching
[1:24:54] and he will cause to come down for you
[1:24:56] the rain the Holy Ghost the former rain
[1:24:59] and the latter rain in the first month
[1:25:01] so in other words it's not going to take
[1:25:03] seven Church ages to get this bride
[1:25:05] ready
[1:25:08] the word's going to come and the Holy
[1:25:10] Ghost is going to Quicken that word in
[1:25:12] the same month in the same time like
[1:25:15] dad's always said he said you get what
[1:25:17] you get today as a former Reign what you
[1:25:19] get today is a is a foundation and then
[1:25:22] when God quickens it
[1:25:25] he harvests that part and you get the
[1:25:27] increase you get look at what he's
[1:25:29] saying that's what he's saying and the
[1:25:31] floor shall be full of wheat the fat
[1:25:33] shall overflow overflow
[1:25:36] with wine and all and I will restore to
[1:25:39] you the years that the locusts of these
[1:25:40] and the canker worm caterpillar pom worm
[1:25:42] my great Army which I stand among you
[1:25:45] and you shall eat in plenty and be
[1:25:47] satisfied that's the second time he said
[1:25:49] satisfied and praise the name of the
[1:25:51] Lord your God that hath dealt wondersly
[1:25:53] with you
[1:25:55] and my people
[1:25:56] shall never
[1:25:58] be ashamed
[1:26:00] former Reign teaching
[1:26:03] you might have a lot of questions you
[1:26:04] might have a lot of things that's on
[1:26:06] your heart you might have a lot of doubt
[1:26:10] but God has got to harvest rain
[1:26:14] that if you'll stay there long enough go
[1:26:17] through the dry spell
[1:26:19] you're going to go through the dry
[1:26:20] spells
[1:26:22] you're going to go through a lot of hot
[1:26:23] sun but watch that hot sun doing that
[1:26:25] hot sun is making that planet grow
[1:26:28] and then at the end time it's going to
[1:26:31] be a harvest
[1:26:32] now this Harvest is different from the
[1:26:34] rest
[1:26:35] because this Harvest God is going to
[1:26:37] take the whole plant with it
[1:26:42] not just a little kernel of corn right
[1:26:45] he's taking the whole unit
[1:26:47] so he the former in latter rain in the
[1:26:50] end time
[1:26:51] is going to be like this
[1:26:53] and it's going to come together where
[1:26:56] what word we get today is quickened
[1:26:58] today
[1:26:59] we don't have to see Luther in their
[1:27:00] time to just shall live by faith they
[1:27:02] had to wait years and years and years
[1:27:04] and years and years and they finally
[1:27:05] they didn't get all of it and they were
[1:27:08] left in doubt they went into
[1:27:09] denominationalism
[1:27:11] and all those things and Wesley comes
[1:27:13] and he said man everybody's like wow
[1:27:15] that's great man now now let's just
[1:27:17] don't drink tea because it's not it has
[1:27:19] no value you know let's let's uh go to
[1:27:21] church you know he started the mess of
[1:27:23] this church and I know some of you know
[1:27:24] what Methodist means it means method
[1:27:25] Right Wesley gave him a method of
[1:27:28] worship if you're if you'll read a
[1:27:30] Methodist songbook it'll tell you at the
[1:27:33] front everything you need to do some of
[1:27:34] you shaking your head because you read
[1:27:35] it I went to a message to church one
[1:27:37] time and actually opened the book and
[1:27:38] read the thing and John Wesley it's got
[1:27:40] his name on it the things that he wrote
[1:27:42] do this worship this way do this that
[1:27:44] was a method but God was trying to teach
[1:27:45] people what just like I was talking
[1:27:47] about this morning don't let your kids
[1:27:48] run around outside don't let your kids
[1:27:50] run in church don't let your kids uh
[1:27:52] choose chewing gum or or you know throw
[1:27:54] papers or hey we don't throw papers
[1:27:56] anymore right now say tax yeah so you're
[1:28:00] not looking for this anymore you'll be
[1:28:02] looking for this
[1:28:04] and I know what goes on because I see it
[1:28:07] but anyway God's got to change it I
[1:28:09] can't do that
[1:28:16] everything's got to be positive
[1:28:19] because there's no negative in God now
[1:28:22] this part is the negative that God that
[1:28:24] God gave us through Mom and Daddy right
[1:28:25] here we didn't get into negative and
[1:28:27] positive I hope you understood that
[1:28:28] negative and positive is the same as
[1:28:30] partial and perfect
[1:28:32] all right the negative is
[1:28:36] I don't know why I can do it or not
[1:28:41] trying to see that shadow see that
[1:28:43] shadow
[1:28:44] that's negative but what is it a
[1:28:47] negative of
[1:28:48] what's real
[1:28:50] right man there has to be something real
[1:28:52] there
[1:28:53] before that shadow but when you do this
[1:28:55] what happens
[1:28:57] the shadow in the hand becomes one
[1:29:00] and that's what happened in the ages
[1:29:01] they looked through a glass Darkly they
[1:29:03] saw they saw Paul saw Jesus
[1:29:07] Peter saw Jesus they all saw him in the
[1:29:09] way they saw him Luther Wesley and all
[1:29:11] those but in the end time
[1:29:13] like we read the quotes the prophet
[1:29:15] preached the unadulterated word of God
[1:29:20] now
[1:29:21] every answer in the Bible
[1:29:24] somewhere
[1:29:26] can be answered every question I mean
[1:29:29] can be answered there's not a there's
[1:29:31] not something that you know we wonder
[1:29:34] about little things like what we're
[1:29:36] going to eat at the future home and the
[1:29:38] Millennium what we're gonna
[1:29:40] let's just worry about getting there
[1:29:42] right let's just worry about getting if
[1:29:44] we have tablecloths we have napkins who
[1:29:47] cares you're not going to worry about it
[1:29:50] because if you start worrying about
[1:29:52] those kind of things guess what Satan's
[1:29:54] going to do he's going to run your own
[1:29:55] mind all the way that way and you're
[1:29:57] going to miss what the preacher's
[1:29:59] talking about all right save them do
[1:30:01] that now I know he will
[1:30:02] be that way I'll be thinking about
[1:30:04] planting seed and I'll be going over
[1:30:06] here planting seed in the in the food
[1:30:07] plot somewhere instead of talking acting
[1:30:09] about it instead of realizing what the
[1:30:12] preacher's talking about
[1:30:13] that's what Satan's job is that's right
[1:30:15] but read Joel 2
[1:30:18] please this week read it just one time
[1:30:22] read that whole chapter and just think
[1:30:24] of God talking to you not talking to
[1:30:27] Israel not talking to uh there were uh
[1:30:31] Zion Zion was a place had people in it
[1:30:34] but they're all gone they're all dead
[1:30:37] they can't read
[1:30:40] we're the only ones alive and remaining
[1:30:42] that's right foreign latter rain in the
[1:30:45] end time
[1:30:46] is going to come together to where it's
[1:30:48] going to be like popping popcorn
[1:30:50] you're going to get revelation after
[1:30:52] revelation after Revelation if you don't
[1:30:53] get in Revelation now people you need to
[1:30:56] be in the Altar and pray you need to go
[1:30:58] to your own closet your own Altar and
[1:31:00] pray if you're not getting a revelation
[1:31:03] I'm not saying every day I'm not saying
[1:31:06] every hour
[1:31:09] but brother Brown said if you come to
[1:31:11] church
[1:31:12] you'll never leave the same musicians
[1:31:15] come you'll never leave the same you'll
[1:31:17] either leave better
[1:31:20] or worse
[1:31:22] you want me to explain that
[1:31:24] brother Boyd walked in the door the
[1:31:26] other day
[1:31:27] and he had some wrong things
[1:31:30] that he was bringing with him
[1:31:34] can I use you for example that's okay
[1:31:35] I'm sure
[1:31:37] he has some wrong things that he brought
[1:31:39] into this church not wrong as far as
[1:31:41] dirty and the things that he needed to
[1:31:43] get rid of right
[1:31:44] so he came in a certain way
[1:31:48] right he came in a certain way this is
[1:31:50] the way that you were right then what
[1:31:53] happened
[1:31:54] he sits down
[1:31:56] and do you know if he stood up and at
[1:31:58] the end of that service if he turned and
[1:32:00] walked out the door
[1:32:03] what would have happened
[1:32:04] he would have been 10 times worse than
[1:32:08] he walked in the first time because he
[1:32:10] took what he was needed to get rid of he
[1:32:12] took it out with him right
[1:32:14] then he got back out in that world and
[1:32:16] got out and all that junk I know this
[1:32:17] one not what happened but that's what
[1:32:19] could have happened
[1:32:20] but what did he do he laid it all down
[1:32:23] and he left a different person
[1:32:27] so you're either going to leave today
[1:32:29] better
[1:32:30] or worse
[1:32:32] you can leave better by saying God
[1:32:34] you've given me a little bit of teaching
[1:32:36] today now add to that
[1:32:39] so that I can get this
[1:32:42] under subjection to the one I can't see
[1:32:45] inside but you know what
[1:32:48] we live with both of them
[1:32:51] it's a battle brother brother fought
[1:32:54] right it's a battle
[1:32:56] I mean just to be honest we don't want
[1:32:59] to say this but we are two separate
[1:33:00] people
[1:33:01] if you're born again now if you're not
[1:33:03] born again you're not but if you're born
[1:33:04] again you're really kind of two separate
[1:33:06] people right
[1:33:08] right look white dog black dog right
[1:33:10] okay
[1:33:13] and which one did the old Chief which
[1:33:15] one do you say one
[1:33:16] one that he fed the most let's stand
[1:33:21] the one he's whatever you feed them
[1:33:25] that's which one that's what's gonna
[1:33:27] happen
[1:33:28] but I think we've come to the place to
[1:33:30] where now that it should be that we
[1:33:32] should be taking what's coming across
[1:33:34] and we we should be letting that
[1:33:38] you know just mull around let well do
[1:33:41] like I do you know you don't have to do
[1:33:43] like I do right that's me but anytime I
[1:33:45] get along and cut grass or or you know
[1:33:48] on the lawn mower
[1:33:49] or uh
[1:33:51] I'd be walking in a house somewhere
[1:33:53] and I'll see something that'll spark
[1:33:55] something I've been thinking but in that
[1:33:57] room
[1:34:00] now remember
[1:34:01] rain
[1:34:03] a former word had to be planted
[1:34:06] I had to hear
[1:34:08] then what did God do God honored that
[1:34:11] brother Brown said you want God to come
[1:34:12] on the scene he said start thinking
[1:34:14] about him
[1:34:15] anyway Sam start thinking about him he
[1:34:18] said if you think about him and get
[1:34:19] serious he'll come on the scene
[1:34:21] so let's start thinking about God
[1:34:24] bring him on the scene because when I
[1:34:26] was doing those food place you know what
[1:34:27] I was doing I was out there for thirty
[1:34:29] dollars worth of diesel fuel
[1:34:31] because I bought thirty dollars worth of
[1:34:33] diesel fuel and I run it all out of the
[1:34:35] motor
[1:34:36] it was about 11 hours on that tractor so
[1:34:38] I preached about three or four Sherman
[1:34:41] but you know what I was doing I was
[1:34:42] saying God
[1:34:44] what do these people need
[1:34:48] then you start thinking about well I'm
[1:34:50] out here planting
[1:34:52] I mean I'm out here cutting and I'm
[1:34:53] gonna plant
[1:34:54] I'm going to talk on forming a lot of
[1:34:56] rain see you know what so God comes to
[1:34:58] that
[1:35:00] amen I had zero notes written this
[1:35:02] morning zero
[1:35:05] I walked in that room and shut the door
[1:35:06] I said God I need something quick
[1:35:10] and I got for this morning and when I
[1:35:13] walked in there at 115 or about 1 30
[1:35:15] today
[1:35:16] 115 I didn't have a note rope
[1:35:18] not one
[1:35:20] not one I had some quotes
[1:35:23] are not good without something to back
[1:35:25] it up
[1:35:27] but I'm like Dad you know I trust that
[1:35:28] gift amen because I'm sincere and
[1:35:31] honestly if I'm just the biggest
[1:35:33] scoundrel in the world if I if if if if
[1:35:36] God just decides to cast me away I want
[1:35:39] you people to make it
[1:35:41] I want you to make it
[1:35:43] I really really feel for every part I
[1:35:46] want you to make it
[1:35:48] I want you to make it whether I make it
[1:35:50] or not but you know what I'm just like
[1:35:51] kind of like what brother didn't said
[1:35:53] you know and you come to the realization
[1:35:55] that that you've seen so much of God
[1:35:59] to where if you did walk up and he said
[1:36:03] cast into the pits of hell I'd have to
[1:36:05] say God thank you for letting me at
[1:36:07] least see I can read your Bible with my
[1:36:09] natural eyes
[1:36:11] I can see that there's somebody in the
[1:36:13] end time that's so much different
[1:36:15] than anybody else that's ever walked the
[1:36:17] face of the earth besides you Jesus
[1:36:20] I said I'm glad you let me meet some of
[1:36:22] us
[1:36:23] I'm glad you let me walk among their
[1:36:26] life and I'm honest with that with my
[1:36:28] hand up I'm just glad brother gave that
[1:36:30] I got to know you whether I don't make
[1:36:32] it or not
[1:36:34] a good journey I'd rather you make it
[1:36:36] sir been a good job yes sir been a good
[1:36:39] journey if this is not it let's keep
[1:36:41] this until that gets there if this is
[1:36:43] farmer and ladders coming which that's
[1:36:45] the truth I mean look at what we've
[1:36:48] look at what we got but look at what's
[1:36:50] coming not like coming we're prophesying
[1:36:53] that it's coming to somebody else let's
[1:36:55] don't do that
[1:36:56] but you can prophesy you die
[1:36:59] let's quit putting it off that's
[1:37:01] right when that which is perfect is come
[1:37:05] that which is in part
[1:37:07] in other words we'll be put back here as
[1:37:09] a foundation
[1:37:11] when that which we know in part and we
[1:37:14] prophesy in part
[1:37:16] but that which is perfect has come
[1:37:19] that which is in part it's not going to
[1:37:20] be done away like we think of no it's
[1:37:23] just going to be there's no way this
[1:37:24] could be here without this
[1:37:26] there's no way you can have the love of
[1:37:28] God and not have every one of those
[1:37:30] virtues working in your life let's sing
[1:37:33] a song
[1:37:36] mountain is no longer on
[1:37:59] me
[1:38:07] and say God bless you foreign
[1:39:28] Straight Talk
[1:40:06] on the streets of Glory
[1:40:23] lives
[1:40:41] entire thing for
[1:40:51] eign
[1:41:38] you look at all these songs that we sing
[1:41:40] they talk about dying and all this stuff
[1:41:43] I know it's okay but you know that was
[1:41:44] partial understanding
[1:41:46] that was a partial understanding they
[1:41:48] were gonna die when I die Hallelujah
[1:41:51] that was partial that's all they
[1:41:54] understood that's all they could see
[1:41:57] but see that when it which is perfect
[1:41:58] this come we don't do away with those
[1:42:01] songs but
[1:42:01] that's for them
[1:42:04] it's not for us as far as the dying part
[1:42:08] there's no way
[1:42:10] that you're gonna make it if you say I
[1:42:13] can't make it that's right you just cut
[1:42:15] yourself off right there
[1:42:17] you said I can't do it then guess what
[1:42:20] you're your worst enemy because God
[1:42:23] never said you couldn't do it you just
[1:42:25] said you couldn't
[1:42:27] do just
[1:42:29] wearing them for 25
[1:42:36] between us on on
[1:42:38] all right brother for this cam I don't
[1:42:39] mind me telling it but it's just human
[1:42:42] beings
[1:42:43] and I said well she said well she can't
[1:42:45] get over stuff like that a lot you know
[1:42:47] instantly and I said well I can
[1:42:50] I said I have to
[1:42:51] I have to get over stuff like that
[1:42:54] I don't dwell on you know Jen and I had
[1:42:57] a argument over money
[1:43:00] if you lost a hundred dollars
[1:43:04] we were having a family discussion
[1:43:07] and brother Daryl Hughes called
[1:43:10] Gerald Hughes Hall and of course he's
[1:43:13] the great emancipator he's the great
[1:43:17] orator
[1:43:19] and he said hello brother wait how you
[1:43:21] doing I said I'm doing great and he just
[1:43:23] he was prophesying I think he said well
[1:43:25] let me ask
[1:43:27] the boss
[1:43:28] and see how you're doing
[1:43:30] and I said oh she just left the room and
[1:43:33] she did she just left the room I didn't
[1:43:36] want her to talk to him because she
[1:43:38] would have told him what we were doing
[1:43:40] but you know the Lord sent that by but
[1:43:42] you know we got all I mean we
[1:43:44] 've done
[1:43:49] it was and I snapped too quick sometimes
[1:43:51] and some other that don't I don't think
[1:43:53] about that tomorrow tomorrow don't go
[1:43:56] now Susan said oh and she's a no
[1:44:00] I want you so old to be right right
[1:44:03] that's it human beings we are human
[1:44:06] beings
[1:44:07] we are going to be different thank God
[1:44:11] but we have the same purpose the same
[1:44:14] goals we should have the same goals we
[1:44:17] might pick on each other by doing this
[1:44:19] and doing that but look when it comes
[1:44:22] down to the word of God we all have one
[1:44:24] thing in common
[1:44:26] if you're born again
[1:44:28] that word of God's important to your
[1:44:29] life right and if you've got a problem
[1:44:33] talk to me brother Dale some deacons
[1:44:35] talk to somebody Elders doesn't matter
[1:44:39] don't let things Fester all right don't
[1:44:42] let things don't let things you know
[1:44:43] don't don't let the sun go down your
[1:44:45] wrath you know what the Bible said Don't
[1:44:48] Let the Sun Go Down your Wrath
[1:44:50] do not do that because tomorrow it'll
[1:44:52] factor into something a whole lot worse
[1:44:54] and it's really not nothing that's right
[1:44:58] I mean she lost a hundred dollars
[1:45:01] and money's tied
[1:45:03] around my house
[1:45:04] and but you know what
