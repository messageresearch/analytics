[0:20] the lord and have everybody connected
[0:23] out on their
[0:23] airwaves and everything we're just
[0:26] appreciated
[0:27] i was sitting there thinking i'd give a
[0:29] little quote there the other night where
[0:30] the prophet said
[0:32] that when these persecutions and things
[0:34] come and said
[0:35] we'd be meeting in old store buildings
[0:36] and homes and things well we are already
[0:38] meeting in homes
[0:40] around the the day and the hour we're
[0:43] already doing that so we're fulfilling
[0:45] the word amen
[0:47] but it's good to be able to say that we
[0:49] can at least
[0:50] worship and and for the time being you
[0:53] know anything
[0:54] it may get to where we can't things may
[0:56] tighten down but when it does
[0:58] then god will take care of it there and
[1:00] everything will be right on time but

[2:40] father we thank you for this day and for
[2:42] this the grace that you have
[2:44] bestowed upon each and every one of us
[2:46] and we pray that you would just guide
[2:47] each one that our hearts may be set on
[2:50] you that our thinking are all would be
[2:52] gathered and centered around
[2:54] to your mind and your thoughts and lord
[2:57] just have your way remember the sick
[2:59] among us thank you for being with the
[3:00] lily there and
[3:01] making everything to be all right and

[3:16] just
[3:17] bless each one have your way with each
[3:19] one remember our wife lord
[3:21] just take away these old problems or the
[3:23] sinuses
[3:24] the congestions and whatever that there
[3:27] it is she's not able to breathe real
[3:29] good
[3:29] she's maybe everything's okay on the
[3:33] side of the the negative point but now
[3:36] we need for the body to come into being
[3:38] into the point of of it being okay we
[3:41] thank you and we love you and
[3:43] we just commit everything to you now
[3:45] guide us and keep us
[3:46] in jesus name amen okay
[3:50] revelations 3 14 because this is to this
[3:54] age so we'll be
[3:55] taking a little thought in the next two
[3:57] or three messages
[3:59] to uh you know tie together something
[4:02] uh i don't know how it's gonna work out
[4:04] because i may have to just back off and
[4:07] say okay wade you finish yours because
[4:09] i know what he's heading to on it but
[4:12] i'm just trying to stay where i was
[4:16] on the basis of the life's thoughts that
[4:18] we had you know
[4:20] of the point of being two creations are
[4:24] a spiritual creation and a natural
[4:26] creation
[4:27] and so we're still going to be dealing
[4:29] with that line and thought
[4:30] you know uh to where it can be
[4:34] because one is a spiritual the other one
[4:35] is a natural on it
[4:37] so just remember that and unto the angel
[4:41] of the church of the lady of siam's
[4:43] right these things saith the amen the
[4:45] faithful and true witness the beginning
[4:48] of the creation of god amen
[4:51] now let's go to john
[4:54] 4 24.
[5:01] excuse me find where i'm at okay
[5:07] very familiar scripture with all of us
[5:09] says god
[5:10] is a spirit and they that worship him
[5:13] must worship him
[5:14] in spirit and in truth okay back up to
[5:22] 118.
[5:25] it says no man has seen god at any time
[5:29] the only begotten son which is in the
[5:31] bosom of the father
[5:32] he has declared him amen you may be
[5:35] seated the lord had his blessing
[5:37] to the reading of the word so remember
[5:39] these announcements and things and
[5:42] of the future parts of brother
[5:45] luis with the service wednesday and
[5:47] we'll be here the lord willing on those
[5:49] things but
[5:49] then for the weekend brother uh aaron
[5:52] and brother bob will be taking over
[5:54] uh forrest cohen will be going up to
[5:57] dedicate the building
[5:58] okay um my wife wrote me a note wanted
[6:01] me to read
[6:02] thanks to the church for everything so
[6:04] let's get that
[6:06] says my wife and for about my wife and i
[6:09] it's you know okay
[6:10] because she's i've been involved in it
[6:12] too uh we want to thank you
[6:14] everyone for the calls the prayers
[6:19] food that was sent and then even the
[6:22] time of the
[6:23] anniversary when people gathered and
[6:26] come in and
[6:27] gifts and the different things over our
[6:29] anniversary
[6:30] and knowing that was 62 years so we've
[6:33] had a wonderful time together
[6:36] we're so blessed for having such godly
[6:38] people here in our church
[6:41] we are so glad to have each one of you
[6:45] to cross our path here on earth still
[6:49] pray for
[6:49] my wife she has an uh she was negative
[6:53] on the point of the test
[6:54] but still their sinuses is bothering
[6:56] their drainages and things she's
[6:58] coughing a lot
[6:59] pray the lord will take care of all of
[7:01] that and
[7:02] do that so just remember to give her as
[7:04] much prayer as you can
[7:06] because the lord knows we need prayer
[7:10] and everything but just just pray for
[7:12] her
[7:13] okay all right now i i took a thought
[7:16] there the other day with
[7:18] with uh points you know and i said i'd
[7:21] i'd picked up some thoughts but
[7:23] uh brother aaron the other night
[7:25] remember when early other weeks or
[7:27] so ago he brought out a point and i
[7:30] wrote it down and i thought well i'll
[7:32] keep that because that's a good point
[7:34] but he brought out his point was that
[7:38] uh you know three things
[7:42] as it goes forth first it's a secret
[7:48] all right you remember that and then
[7:50] this message he was bringing
[7:52] first it's a secret the secret is
[7:55] something that's
[7:56] totally hidden no one knows what it is
[8:01] they don't know how to explain it
[8:02] because if he did it wouldn't be a
[8:04] secret
[8:06] i'm not in the days of what a lot of
[8:08] people thinks you know they say well
[8:10] it's a secret as long as you tell the
[8:11] other person not to tell
[8:13] what you're telling them and it's if
[8:15] they do you tell that person not to tell
[8:17] the other person what they're telling
[8:18] you know they're
[8:19] trying to make some secret part now a
[8:21] secret is something that
[8:24] cannot be comprehended by the natural
[8:28] mind
[8:29] it is a total secret and it's held into
[8:33] that position
[8:34] and that's the way god does things all
[8:37] right see then the next it comes from a
[8:39] secret
[8:40] to a mystery then you begin
[8:44] to understand a little bit about what
[8:47] this secret is
[8:49] but it's still a mystery
[8:53] all right it's still uh covered over or
[8:57] whatever you want to call it
[8:59] place to where that you can't see it
[9:01] perfectly the way you want to
[9:03] but see then the third thing is when
[9:05] anything is revealed
[9:06] or made manifest you know and taken it
[9:10] so then that way the word of god comes
[9:13] into view
[9:13] so remember the point and i wrote that
[9:16] down i thought that's a good thing
[9:17] because
[9:18] it's it's when we started studying this
[9:21] message
[9:22] you reach you pick up the bible you
[9:23] begin to read it's it's just a secret
[9:27] you know and you read it you try to
[9:28] study it and things like that
[9:30] but it stays a secret until things take
[9:33] place
[9:34] then it can move into a point of a
[9:36] mystery but remember
[9:38] it's a mystery and a mystery cannot be
[9:41] explained
[9:44] all right see then it takes a revelation
[9:48] to explain the mystery and then you'll
[9:51] see the secret
[9:52] it'll all come into view and i thought
[9:54] well that's that's a good point i'll
[9:55] i'll i'll uh i'll leave it on that all
[9:58] right
[9:59] because what we've been trying to do now
[10:01] and i want to continue on our thought
[10:03] um see what i've been trying to do is to
[10:06] bring out a point to look at it
[10:08] that from this point of the secret to
[10:12] mystery you know in the manifestation
[10:16] until light is brought upon a mystery
[10:21] it's still a secret but then when light
[10:24] shines upon that mystery
[10:28] all right then it begins to unveil and
[10:30] you begin to see
[10:32] the secret all right so what have we
[10:34] been talking about going back before the
[10:36] foundation of the world
[10:38] going back into the mind of god
[10:41] to where that we could could uh you know
[10:44] begin
[10:44] to see things and to understand it
[10:48] all right and then we're going to be
[10:50] dealing with beginning of creation for a
[10:53] little bit you know a couple of
[10:54] services on on doing it uh
[10:58] and i'm reading the title that you'll
[10:59] see the prophet used it
[11:01] be it's the beginning of the the the
[11:05] the opening of the word trying to get a
[11:08] little something to
[11:09] before you can see that it takes the
[11:12] prophet then
[11:14] to take the mystery and explain it
[11:18] and once he explains that then it's no
[11:21] longer a
[11:22] secret thing
[11:26] but yet there's still something
[11:28] supernatural left that you cannot
[11:30] understand
[11:32] all right see until it's fully revealed
[11:35] or made known
[11:36] or made manifest as a better word for it
[11:39] because it comes more
[11:40] into reality all right so you started
[11:44] off with where we were on our last
[11:46] couple of messages talking about what
[11:49] that as god
[11:53] is bringing forth his word to you and me
[11:57] then we begin to understand what he has
[12:00] in his mind
[12:03] that he wants to be revealed
[12:06] okay we can go through and we will we'll
[12:08] pick it up a little more in the next
[12:09] message or two where
[12:11] you know where you can can see that that
[12:13] he wanted this to be understood it was
[12:15] in his mind it was a mystery
[12:17] uh in his mind he wanted it revealed how
[12:20] that he was god he was savior
[12:22] but remember now we have to to
[12:24] understand a lot of things you remember
[12:26] the last points we were thinking on
[12:28] you have to understand something by
[12:30] revelation
[12:32] because uh you know just like i was
[12:35] trying to express
[12:36] one point i remember that that see god
[12:39] did not have to
[12:42] create but he done that for
[12:45] his own purpose of what it would bring
[12:47] forth his desires
[12:49] our manifestation and he could bring
[12:52] things into being
[12:53] and it would be a no longer a mystery
[12:59] but it'd be something revealed to you
[13:02] and i so he would
[13:03] show himself as father healer etc
[13:07] but remember he could be father when he
[13:09] created adam and eve
[13:12] he could actually be called father when
[13:14] he created the angels
[13:16] before the world all right so there are
[13:18] some things that
[13:20] can be without it having to be in full
[13:22] manifestation
[13:24] see then it comes on over as a savior
[13:26] now
[13:27] that it means there's got to be
[13:28] something lost
[13:30] all right so just remember study your
[13:32] bible or your thoughts in that point
[13:34] that in genesis when god created adam
[13:36] and eve
[13:37] he could be he was a father
[13:41] there was his manifestation he was a
[13:43] father
[13:45] he didn't have to go through being sin
[13:47] entering the picture et cetera
[13:49] so he had adam and eve in the garden in
[13:51] a beautiful situation
[13:53] all right then sin entered the picture
[13:57] and once sin entered the picture then
[13:59] all right it became
[14:00] a problem and all and he would have to
[14:03] come and die
[14:04] and cover that so that's what i want us
[14:07] to kind of do
[14:08] today is to kind of back up into some of
[14:10] those thoughts
[14:12] and and be able to bring it out to where
[14:16] that you can see
[14:18] that god's mystery secret
[14:21] has been made known i believe that i
[14:24] believe the prophet has made that known
[14:26] we don't have to wonder about it we've
[14:29] got the message
[14:31] see so all we got we just studied the
[14:33] message
[14:34] it goes like the christ is a mystery and
[14:36] we can go through all of those things
[14:38] and and so great of a message that he he
[14:41] even said it in there he
[14:43] he said and we emphasize that a little
[14:45] bit but uh
[14:46] he said now he didn't say go back to the
[14:48] seals and go over this do that
[14:50] or daniel 70 weeks if you don't
[14:52] understand these things
[14:53] he said go to christ a mystery all right
[14:56] see then because that's a mystery but
[14:59] remember now
[14:59] it was a secret things has to do
[15:04] problem and things have to come into
[15:05] view then it becomes a mystery
[15:09] you remember when you first heard the
[15:10] prophet talking
[15:13] i thought man uh i'm enjoying what he's
[15:17] saying
[15:17] but this is getting too far i mean
[15:21] he we'll read it in a minute where he
[15:22] says that god's first creation was god
[15:25] himself
[15:26] and he said well wait just a minute now
[15:29] there's something wrong here i still
[15:31] have a mystery
[15:33] you know i'm still wondering about these
[15:35] things
[15:36] but yet then when he explains it it's no
[15:39] longer a mystery
[15:42] it becomes a revelation to you and i and
[15:44] that's what we want to do is to
[15:46] back up into the back part of god's mind
[15:48] and come out of there
[15:49] with having the natural understanding
[15:51] you know or not say
[15:52] natural understanding because this is
[15:54] the point
[15:56] beginning of the creation
[15:59] all right first off the word beginning
[16:04] if you look it up websters and the
[16:06] things and look it in
[16:07] in your your concordances and things
[16:12] you'll find it's an odd word and we all
[16:14] look at it like something that
[16:18] is not there but all at once it becomes
[16:22] there
[16:23] and we call that a beginning
[16:27] i mean we we say that's a beginning
[16:30] all right now that's that's the point of
[16:32] the word but it's not the emphasis
[16:35] that i want to be brought into it see a
[16:38] beginning to me
[16:40] is when something is brought into light
[16:45] not say when it begin
[16:48] i mean uh this is one brother branham
[16:52] says it
[16:53] really got me he said the tv was in
[16:55] genesis
[16:57] he said in the garden well i i i got a
[17:00] little sense i
[17:01] think we all got a little bit but it's
[17:03] not talking about a box sitting there
[17:05] that was a ge
[17:06] or or whatever you know you plug it in
[17:08] and it runs all this stuff
[17:09] it's some things that was taking place
[17:13] all right and see it was things coming
[17:16] from genesis
[17:17] that was a secret then it comes into
[17:21] manner
[17:22] to more of a mystery but then it becomes
[17:25] into a point of being revealed
[17:27] or made known to the eye
[17:32] the word that you can comprehend all
[17:34] right see now
[17:36] when light shines on an object
[17:40] light will bring that object into view
[17:43] that you can see what it is
[17:45] all right now it was sitting there
[17:48] maybe thousands of years
[17:52] you know that's what it's talking about
[17:53] the tv and the things he's saying see it
[17:55] was dire
[17:57] but yet it didn't come into being
[18:01] see the tv was there the things were
[18:04] there
[18:04] but it didn't come into being until
[18:06] we're in the 40s or
[18:08] 30s or 40s when the tv began to come
[18:10] into view
[18:12] you know that we could see those things
[18:14] all right you say well it had a
[18:15] beginning
[18:17] well where did it have its beginning it
[18:19] had its beginning in the garden
[18:23] but we didn't see it like that it was a
[18:26] secret
[18:28] and it's still in a mystery once it even
[18:30] was brought out
[18:31] i don't understand it i don't i remember
[18:35] most of you don't remember not old
[18:37] enough to remember the old tubes and
[18:39] and the old tvs when you when you had a
[18:42] thing this big
[18:43] and that big and that big and a little
[18:45] screen this big
[18:47] most of you don't remember nothing like
[18:49] that because you're you're not old
[18:50] enough
[18:51] but i remember there was a man that used
[18:53] to work on tvs well he said at my house
[18:56] one night
[18:57] and he explained to me for probably an
[19:00] hour
[19:00] what made the tv work well you know what
[19:04] when he left
[19:05] it's still a secret
[19:10] and he made it a mystery because he
[19:12] really made it
[19:13] you know because if you'll remember
[19:16] something in the bible terminologies
[19:19] when you're looking at something that is
[19:20] not fully made known
[19:23] just remember hold on to that real close
[19:27] because it's got to go from a secret
[19:30] to a mystery to the spiritual eye
[19:35] right now remember the two creations
[19:37] we're talking about what
[19:39] spiritual creation and then physical or
[19:42] natural creations and and things to be
[19:45] coming into view
[19:46] but the spiritual creation comes first
[19:50] so we back up before time could ever
[19:53] begin and we look at it as
[19:56] being trying to comprehend almighty god
[20:00] all right and see without this prophet
[20:02] to express it unto us we would have
[20:03] never had a chance of understanding
[20:05] theologians can't understand i mean if
[20:08] you told a theologian
[20:09] that the genesis that the tv was back
[20:12] there i mean he
[20:13] he he would go haywire with you because
[20:15] he wouldn't
[20:16] you know understand that unless he was a
[20:19] real smart person
[20:21] because then you had to bring this
[20:23] together you had to get this together
[20:24] you had to get this together you had to
[20:25] do this together you had to get all this
[20:27] together
[20:27] finally it began to work you know and i
[20:31] never could understand the
[20:32] what they call it the cat hired uh radio
[20:35] where they see they had
[20:36] you could actually it was some way could
[20:39] that thing would actually
[20:40] make sounds and and do it and all like
[20:43] that
[20:44] because it to me it's still a mystery
[20:46] yeah you know all right
[20:48] but now my point look at it what is the
[20:50] beginning of something
[20:52] there's whole thing settle down to one
[20:54] thing what is the beginning to you
[20:59] is it when something comes into
[21:01] existence
[21:03] or is it when something comes into
[21:07] the point of that you can comprehend
[21:12] so there's a secret then mystery see
[21:15] something
[21:16] moving to a point you could comprehend
[21:18] amen
[21:20] when you think about god and the way the
[21:21] prophet described it as
[21:23] elohim self-existing he existed alone
[21:27] nobody was with him he was back there
[21:29] all by himself
[21:31] all he had was attributes and none of
[21:33] those attributes were
[21:34] in manifestation because none of them
[21:38] had been brought forth yet he was not a
[21:40] father
[21:41] he was all that he wasn't god because
[21:44] god is an object of worship
[21:46] and there was nothing to worship him we
[21:48] can go through the whole message
[21:49] backwards and forth
[21:51] as the prophet has brought it unto us to
[21:54] understand
[21:55] but yet in finishing it all up
[21:59] when did something begin
[22:06] when did god begin
[22:12] he said well brother dale god didn't
[22:14] begin
[22:16] well now you're right that's that's okay
[22:19] god didn't begin he had no beginning
[22:22] but just remember jesus had a beginning
[22:28] god had no beginning now
[22:32] we've got a mystery
[22:36] how would jesus be
[22:39] almighty god
[22:44] but yet have a beginning
[22:51] see it takes a lot of understanding i'm
[22:53] trying to get us to look at something
[22:54] new because looking at it then as
[22:56] something you see first by the spiritual
[22:59] eye
[23:00] that's right you got to see it
[23:03] by the eye of faith
[23:06] you've got to accept it by faith and you
[23:08] can't say well i i don't you're just
[23:11] saying that back there you know
[23:12] there was a time that he wasn't god it
[23:14] was he was always god
[23:17] he always was god and always will be god
[23:20] but there was a time he could not be
[23:21] understood
[23:24] are you following me now a time that he
[23:26] could not be comprehended
[23:32] then the theologians can come along and
[23:34] take the wordings and things
[23:36] they could do pretty good they could
[23:38] come up with sunships and things of
[23:39] course they'd run it into eternals and
[23:41] and mess it up but but yet they could
[23:44] come forth and understand the
[23:46] logos theophany the brother around them
[23:48] never developed them words
[23:51] i mean them words was here when he came
[23:55] and if you'll read him a lot of times
[23:57] he'll let's see which one is it
[23:59] uh i'll think of it in a minute but he
[24:02] pronounces it
[24:04] one word like logos will deceive that
[24:06] but he'll pronounce it
[24:07] in different messages it's got an
[24:09] entirely different sound
[24:12] and he'll start out on something and it
[24:16] sounds
[24:16] the way he's pronouncing it it doesn't
[24:18] sound right
[24:20] then in a minute he'll pronounce it
[24:21] correctly
[24:23] it's like he's gaining ground and i'm
[24:24] sure that's what he's doing
[24:26] you know he's understanding how to
[24:28] pronounce those words
[24:30] not that he's going to school
[24:35] but god is going god is schooling him
[24:38] to bring him into the place that he
[24:40] could bring that down to me and you
[24:42] and that's where i thank god for the
[24:44] point of it it all right
[24:46] and and getting to the point then see
[24:48] that you see things first by the
[24:50] spiritual eye of faith
[24:54] all right then it can come into
[24:58] reality manifestation
[25:02] making it known well when is the
[25:05] beginning
[25:07] i'm just getting the just letting you
[25:09] think on your mind
[25:10] see we think a beginning is when
[25:12] something started
[25:15] you know but we can put that as it
[25:17] started right here
[25:19] well then we realized like going to say
[25:21] the atom bomb for instance
[25:23] you know it took many many years to
[25:27] develop
[25:29] that to a point that you could split an
[25:32] atom
[25:35] you know it took scientists
[25:38] many many years to come to an
[25:41] understanding of how to split an atom
[25:44] and then they turn around and say i've
[25:46] got enough right here in my hand to be
[25:48] able to blow the world up
[25:51] and you say i don't see it well that's
[25:54] the point it's still
[25:56] kept secret until it was with the made
[25:58] known
[25:59] and then the secret little keys you know
[26:03] that they had to come up with i don't i
[26:06] say
[26:06] understanding is the key to me all right
[26:09] but i'm i'm
[26:10] asking you to think with me on
[26:13] spiritual eye of faith and how that will
[26:17] come in to a point that your
[26:19] natural eye will soon begin
[26:22] to comprehend things and you can see god
[26:27] in what you're looking at not see god
[26:30] may be standing there
[26:32] not a physical being standing but see
[26:35] him in the trees in the grass and
[26:37] the things and all like that see
[26:40] and you begin to see it like brother
[26:42] bradham would say there over and over
[26:44] what
[26:44] he said you've never seen me
[26:49] we'll get to that on our second stage
[26:51] because this is what we're going to do
[26:52] stage one and stage two
[26:53] stage three stage one we're going to
[26:55] cover god
[26:56] and the basis of him coming into being
[27:00] amen then we'll come in to
[27:03] the word the logos of things etc of
[27:07] that coming into a spiritual being then
[27:09] we'll cover
[27:10] the the beginning of the creation of god
[27:12] as to the mind of christ
[27:14] and the christian and what we are how
[27:16] that you're a christian
[27:18] and see now you are a child of god
[27:22] you're a christian you it's developed
[27:25] into something that's
[27:26] more realistic or tangible all right
[27:30] but now think about it going back in
[27:34] god's mind
[27:37] to the point that we can comprehend that
[27:39] we read the scripture there that says
[27:41] and we'll get to it in a minute where he
[27:43] says no man is seeing god
[27:49] all right now we can take that and we
[27:51] can use that
[27:53] and and but yet we can use our minds in
[27:55] the wrong direction
[27:56] and and then you'll start doing and
[27:58] saying because the prophet is trying to
[28:00] bring it from a secret
[28:02] to a mystery to a found a revelation and
[28:05] you remember the
[28:06] the little child that asked the mama can
[28:08] i see god ask the
[28:10] preacher can you see god ask everybody
[28:12] you know could see god
[28:13] no you can't see god
[28:17] then run across the right one and see
[28:19] that was sitting in the boat
[28:20] said son said everything i've ever seen
[28:22] is god well it's according to how you're
[28:24] looking
[28:26] see that man that when it come to the
[28:29] point that man
[28:30] had over the years in his christian
[28:33] experience serving god and being with
[28:35] god
[28:36] he had developed a uh i guess he'd call
[28:39] it
[28:39] a point to where that he could see god
[28:43] but he could see it in what god made
[28:46] all right and see that's the way we have
[28:49] to see it
[28:51] we look back and we see a beginning
[28:54] and we think a beginning is a starting
[28:56] point it's true
[28:58] it's don't misunderstand me just
[29:01] understand now what i'm saying for the
[29:03] next tale
[29:04] it is a starting point but yet we look
[29:08] at the starting point as to
[29:10] the atom and we say oh well all you got
[29:12] to do is is go over there and throw that
[29:14] switch it'll blow the world up
[29:17] well that's close that can be done
[29:20] because of the bombs the things that are
[29:22] done but yet it took so long to bring
[29:24] that out
[29:26] to get it to where that we can
[29:27] understand because if you remember they
[29:29] were really afraid to set off the first
[29:31] atom bombs because they were afraid
[29:33] that it would start a chain reaction
[29:35] that would just keep rolling the atom
[29:36] and would keep splitting
[29:38] all right then they found out that
[29:41] technically when they split the atom
[29:44] that they did not split it halfway this
[29:47] was greater coming on
[29:48] understanding they didn't when that adam
[29:51] come on and they began to start using
[29:53] they found out they didn't split it
[29:54] height and height they missed it a
[29:56] little
[29:57] well see that was what kept it from
[29:58] blowing up
[30:00] that's you get it that's what kept the
[30:02] world from blowing apart
[30:04] was the splitting of that atom where
[30:05] they'd missed it just enough
[30:07] well god had to plan that and bring
[30:09] everything into being to keep us from
[30:11] being
[30:12] annihilated you know all right but think
[30:15] about it now
[30:17] when you think about beginning
[30:20] or you think about creation
[30:25] what do you think about
[30:28] what do you consider in your mind when
[30:31] you say
[30:35] god had no beginning
[30:39] it will never have any ending
[30:43] but jesus had a beginning
[30:48] and jesus at a time that his body had to
[30:52] be redeemed
[30:55] so now you say okay oh wait you just
[30:57] give us the key because you're talking
[30:58] about his body
[30:59] that's right see because that's what we
[31:02] want to get to remember one thing
[31:05] in body he was a man
[31:11] tangible in spirit
[31:15] he was god so the bible says that
[31:19] god was in christ reconciling the world
[31:23] unto himself where he was in that flesh
[31:28] that walked the shores of galilee but
[31:30] one day that flesh
[31:32] now had a beginning
[31:35] that's right all right now
[31:39] having a beginning it would have to have
[31:42] an ending
[31:43] and it did one day that body was made
[31:46] eternal
[31:47] that's right okay now you've got the
[31:51] whole thing that god and christ are one
[31:54] right see i'm talking about the godhead
[31:56] i'm trying to
[31:57] to get us to think on these things to
[31:59] clear up a little
[32:01] thoughts in their mind about the godhead
[32:03] see
[32:04] when did god begin he said well he
[32:07] didn't begin he always was
[32:09] yeah but he can call himself the
[32:12] beginning
[32:15] revelation it says the beginning of the
[32:18] creation of god
[32:23] and the prophet said we'll read it a
[32:24] minute where he said most people think
[32:26] that that means god created jesus and
[32:28] jesus created everything else he said
[32:30] that's not correct
[32:35] he said what he is that he's the
[32:37] beginner or author
[32:42] you know like author writer
[32:46] beginner author of the creation of god
[32:51] now then what we're trying to do what
[32:53] i'm trying to get you to think about
[32:55] is there was a time that when you
[32:57] remember
[32:58] that you studied your bible
[33:03] you read things but yet one day you
[33:07] heard this
[33:08] prophet and he started explaining
[33:13] and he was trying to understand one god
[33:16] and get it in the correct order and the
[33:19] prophet said
[33:20] now see thou he said i'm a father
[33:24] i'm a son and said i'm a human being
[33:30] he said but i'm just one and he said now
[33:33] that's the way god is amen
[33:38] wait a minute this secret
[33:42] that i couldn't understand
[33:47] because i read the bible
[33:50] but i couldn't understand the secret
[33:52] because i went into the mystery
[33:54] but see one day things began to unfold a
[33:58] little further as it became to
[33:59] a mystery and the prophet began to
[34:02] explain that mystery say
[34:06] i can see that
[34:10] what could you see it by not natural
[34:12] light
[34:13] but by the eye of faith you could see
[34:17] that god could was what he was trying to
[34:19] do was reveal himself
[34:21] all right now that's what i want you to
[34:23] think on until we get through the series
[34:25] of this
[34:26] of the beginning of something is when
[34:28] god is going to try to bring it from
[34:31] the secret may have to come through a
[34:35] mystery
[34:37] a mysterious but one day it's going to
[34:40] be made known
[34:42] that's what we've had if you understand
[34:44] what i'm getting at
[34:47] we've had a wonderful marvelous time
[34:50] in god's word to understand what mankind
[34:52] could not understand
[34:57] it was a secret it's still a secret to
[34:59] them the best it can do is make it a
[35:01] mystery
[35:04] right it can just become mysterious
[35:07] but it doesn't help but see the end time
[35:10] bride has brought the prophet has
[35:12] brought the message
[35:13] to the entire bride until he could just
[35:15] talk of things it's so simple
[35:17] it would just be you know your mind
[35:21] is is baffled
[35:24] in what he would say you remember when
[35:26] you first started reading
[35:29] you started studying this message from
[35:33] and it it's it's mysterious
[35:40] and he'd say now now we don't believe in
[35:43] eternal
[35:44] sonship
[35:47] but he said we can understand eternal
[35:49] godhead
[35:51] that's right you can't have an eternal
[35:54] sonship
[35:55] but you can have an eternal godhead you
[35:58] can understand it that way
[36:00] see now it's coming from something that
[36:02] was totally even a secret
[36:05] to mankind and it comes into a mystery
[36:07] that we begin to
[36:09] understand a little bit about these
[36:10] things
[36:14] so then the beginning of anything is
[36:16] when something begins to be made known
[36:20] we'll solve that whole thing i hope you
[36:22] understand what i've been trying to get
[36:24] to with the
[36:25] point the beginning of something is when
[36:27] something can be comprehended
[36:30] that's the best way for me to describe a
[36:32] beginning
[36:35] is when something comes to the point it
[36:38] can be understood
[36:41] maybe he's still mysterious yeah because
[36:44] even brother branham made that point you
[36:45] know he said
[36:46] the mystery is a thing that's revealed
[36:49] but said even as a supernatural element
[36:50] remains
[36:51] despite the fact that it's been revealed
[36:53] to you
[36:54] we don't understand all of it no no we
[36:56] don't claim to understand all of it
[37:01] but we've come to the point of being
[37:03] able to understand some things about god
[37:08] that we're always long to understand
[37:16] when we read you know no man can see god
[37:20] at any time
[37:24] god is a spirit they that worship me
[37:27] must worship him in spirit and truth
[37:31] we had a beginning time that we could
[37:33] start comprehending
[37:37] right a beginning time that when we
[37:39] could start
[37:40] comprehending or start being able to see
[37:43] or understand amen
[37:47] all right so think about how long you've
[37:51] been in this message and what you've
[37:52] studied
[37:52] in comparison to dave to what you see to
[37:55] what it was when you first started
[38:00] you know i mean when you first started
[38:03] you know yourself
[38:04] that it was just it was just a total
[38:07] mystery
[38:10] it might have become from a secret to
[38:12] beginning to understand a little bit it
[38:14] was but it was a total mystery
[38:18] because we couldn't understand it
[38:20] because we were trying to figure it out
[38:22] and put words in there instead of
[38:24] thinking about what is being said so
[38:27] what was the prophet trying to do
[38:28] explain words
[38:32] you know i mean
[38:35] you think about what we do a lot of
[38:37] times you know and we start talking to
[38:39] somebody about one god
[38:40] and what do we say say you know now
[38:42] there's just one god and said now
[38:44] remember he was a logos gossip theophany
[38:46] and they're standing there looking at
[38:47] you what is the logos one is the
[38:49] theophany
[38:52] and see you've really made it a secret
[38:57] because a lot of times what we do we
[39:00] make it a mystery
[39:04] god's trying to reveal itself we're
[39:06] trying to make him a mystery
[39:08] claiming to be able to understand all
[39:10] right but listen
[39:13] when something begins to come into being
[39:18] that you can comprehend it there's your
[39:26] beginning
[39:28] there's your beginning of it now you can
[39:31] start
[39:33] thinking about what that beginning
[39:36] is but it's beginning in your thinking
[39:41] see it's becoming from a secret to a
[39:44] mystery
[39:45] to you
[39:48] all right see then god can reveal that
[39:52] make it known
[39:57] he can show himself
[40:02] and then you and i can understand it the
[40:05] kids then can understand it
[40:08] but remember that when it comes to the
[40:11] list
[40:13] it's a mystery until it's revealed
[40:17] now when it's revealed then you can say
[40:20] i see it
[40:23] but you know you're i think you'll agree
[40:25] with this point have you ever seen
[40:26] something so clear
[40:28] it's just so beautiful clear you're
[40:31] thinking on it and it's just so clear
[40:34] and you say i'm going down and explain
[40:36] to donnie what i just
[40:38] saw and it's so beautiful in your mind
[40:42] and you have such a
[40:43] vast understanding that you can go all
[40:46] the way back before the world
[40:48] with it and come down and see how god
[40:50] does this and you walk up to dawn and
[40:51] you say donny i'd like to
[40:54] oh it's gone
[40:58] you don't ever do that it's gone
[41:01] then you got to go find that mystery
[41:04] and to see if see what's where you
[41:07] missed it out
[41:08] but what you missed it at is one thing
[41:10] now here's what's hard
[41:11] it's trying to explain something
[41:17] there's ways of explaining things that
[41:21] will help us
[41:24] i was telling anybody donnie can do it
[41:26] he can take a car apart
[41:28] put it back together i take it apart and
[41:32] i do like i did with my wife one day
[41:34] when you know how the carburetor kits
[41:36] were the old two barrels especially you
[41:38] know they had a whole bunch of kits and
[41:39] parts in them you know and and you
[41:42] didn't have to have all of it they were
[41:43] just certain things fit that
[41:45] certain carburetor so i was tearing the
[41:47] carburetor apart and put it back
[41:48] together and surprisingly it run
[41:50] and my wife she said what's all of these
[41:54] i said
[41:54] i didn't need them you know
[41:58] well you know what that meant to her
[42:00] what do you mean you're supposed to put
[42:02] them in ain't you
[42:03] no i didn't need them well see i wasn't
[42:06] saying
[42:07] they were i didn't explain to her that
[42:09] that carburetor can't fit about 10
[42:11] different carburetors you know
[42:13] all right but you see a mystery now
[42:15] think about it i'm trying to get
[42:17] to a point to just ease into a thought
[42:21] when you're talking about and let's
[42:23] let's read that one
[42:24] go ahead number one brother and let's
[42:26] let's just read this because i want to
[42:28] get this
[42:29] point to us of what we're talking about
[42:32] this
[42:33] is taken from the lady of seeing church
[42:34] age the beginning of the creation of god
[42:37] that is who the lord jesus says he is
[42:41] now he's describing himself to the
[42:43] church age right
[42:45] look that is who the lord jesus says he
[42:48] is
[42:49] but those words don't mean exactly as
[42:52] they sound to us
[42:54] just taking them the way they sound
[42:58] has made some people in fact multitudes
[43:01] of people
[43:02] get the idea that jesus was the first
[43:05] creation of god
[43:08] making him lower than godhead
[43:12] then this first creation created all the
[43:15] rest of the universe
[43:17] and whatsoever it contains now when we
[43:20] get through explaining to the next stage
[43:23] stage two when we hit stage two you're
[43:26] gonna think that
[43:27] that's exactly what he's saying
[43:30] then you're gonna have to say wait just
[43:32] a minute we've got to get this in the
[43:34] right place
[43:36] cause we'll make a greater mystery out
[43:38] of it cause we'll come right back to
[43:39] this
[43:40] huh in this first creation created all
[43:43] the rest of the universe and whatsoever
[43:44] it contains
[43:45] but that is not right you know that
[43:48] doesn't line up with the rest of the
[43:50] bible
[43:50] well then who created what
[43:54] see the words are he is the beginner
[43:58] and then you say okay he just being our
[44:02] author
[44:05] okay of the creation of god
[44:08] now we know that for surety that jesus
[44:11] is god
[44:11] very god he is the creator all right
[44:15] now think about what he's saying he's
[44:18] the beginner
[44:20] take that beginner as to be now a point
[44:23] of what i'm
[44:24] trying to establish that there was a
[44:26] time it could not be comprehended
[44:29] there was a time when when no one could
[44:31] understand god
[44:34] i mean and then
[44:37] he began to send his prophets
[44:42] with the word amen and they could start
[44:48] telling about god and it could come into
[44:51] being
[44:52] all right so then he's the beginner or
[44:54] author
[44:55] see now to me when he says he's a
[44:57] beginner or author
[44:59] author is a you know somebody writing
[45:02] you're writing down
[45:04] well see what i'm looking at
[45:07] is there was a time we could not
[45:09] comprehend god whatsoever
[45:13] but he begins to condescend toward
[45:16] mankind
[45:20] and as he does he becomes the author of
[45:23] many different
[45:25] uh stages many things comes into view
[45:30] that we'll see him move to from father
[45:33] to son
[45:37] and that's not another person
[45:40] that's the same person
[45:44] but yet it's what he's doing see he's
[45:46] the beginner he's starting to tell the
[45:48] story
[45:50] he's beginning to define our under let
[45:53] us understand
[45:55] you know how did he come into being
[46:02] and he begins to be the author or the
[46:05] writer
[46:06] the writer would signify the beginning
[46:08] again see
[46:09] or the thought is your beginning you're
[46:11] writing it down he brought it to the
[46:13] point
[46:14] we could understand it so then he's not
[46:18] the beginning of the creation of god
[46:20] like god created jesus and jesus created
[46:22] everything else no
[46:28] he's moving from one stage to that next
[46:31] stage
[46:31] to the next stage and doesn't change his
[46:33] personality as being
[46:35] who he is
[46:41] may i say it this way away ahead of time
[46:43] god never sent his son to die
[46:47] come on he came himself
[46:56] the one that died was the father that
[46:57] died for you and i but how'd he die he
[46:59] couldn't die of god our father
[47:02] he had to die as a human being that's
[47:04] right amen
[47:08] condescending or descending or or
[47:11] whatever your thoughts are
[47:14] of god
[47:17] as he brings himself into being
[47:21] and he's doing that from being the
[47:23] beginner of something or anything that
[47:25] needs
[47:26] it he's looking you out you're looking
[47:27] out over the banisters
[47:29] the prophet will read these things and
[47:30] he said what do we see he said we see a
[47:32] little white light because it goes
[47:34] across
[47:34] and that's what you know i remember
[47:37] those because i'd read my
[47:38] my bible a little and he said see there
[47:40] he said that's that logos
[47:43] you know i didn't have much
[47:44] understanding of that but he said see
[47:46] there he said that's the son of god
[47:52] son of god
[47:55] now wait just a minute there's something
[47:57] wrong here because i'm getting up
[47:59] another person over here but i ain't
[48:00] losing nothing over here
[48:03] because that's what you think you're
[48:04] supposed to do no just remember one
[48:06] thing
[48:08] don't throw away nothing that's revealed
[48:12] amen yes sir just watch it unveil
[48:16] it watch it in time with the laps
[48:20] over but it still will unveil itself
[48:24] amen it'll start unveiling
[48:28] and start being made manifest to be seen
[48:31] right right all right see then it's not
[48:34] that god
[48:35] created jesus and jesus created
[48:39] everything else
[48:42] [Music]
[48:43] but yet it is true that the word which
[48:47] is the son of god
[48:48] is the creator god that's right
[48:54] this is what i say don't throw nothing
[48:56] away
[48:58] just let it unveil
[49:01] let it go to the next stage to the next
[49:03] stage that you see it
[49:04] to where that you can say hey look we're
[49:06] we're going all the way back
[49:09] the prophet would cure us back to the
[49:11] mind of god
[49:12] and then he'd go back and he'd say to
[49:14] the back part of god's mind
[49:18] amen that's just going on back past
[49:22] where you can comprehend
[49:24] all right and see that eternity has no
[49:28] beginning
[49:30] and has no ending to it
[49:37] there was a time that we couldn't
[49:38] comprehend these things
[49:43] it meant god would have to send the
[49:44] prophets to unveil
[49:46] all the way down through yeah that's
[49:48] right
[49:50] and i remember expressing it here one
[49:52] time to the church when he was talking
[49:54] about
[49:54] son of man i said don't worry about son
[49:55] of man we need to get son of god
[49:57] straight
[49:58] i said now when when do you think the
[50:00] son of god had a beginning well
[50:02] everybody said 2000 years ago
[50:04] i said even scofield and these
[50:06] theologians
[50:07] let's read to them right here even they
[50:09] know better than now that's right
[50:11] they knew that that logos that theophany
[50:13] was the word
[50:15] he says it i mean scofield puts it in
[50:16] his notes they could see that it was the
[50:19] word
[50:24] and see by understanding it being the
[50:26] word then it could come forth into
[50:28] to a beginning there was a time we
[50:30] couldn't understand
[50:34] then it slowly began to unfold
[50:38] well all right arthur here it unfolded
[50:42] from father
[50:43] we can see he's a father it unfolded
[50:46] into
[50:48] creator
[50:52] god son etc
[50:56] but never lost one person in all of that
[50:58] dude
[51:00] he kept it going all right see the point
[51:03] of
[51:04] to me when i look at the beginning of
[51:06] something i try to go back
[51:08] to find out the real beginning of it
[51:10] instead of just looking out of the car
[51:11] and saying there's a car
[51:14] see i can remember that that car was one
[51:16] time it didn't exist like that
[51:20] and we're not after who what was his
[51:22] name in the the uh
[51:24] comics trip was invented the wheel
[51:27] who was that thor what was his name one
[51:29] of them you know he remember he invented
[51:30] the wheel
[51:31] put a rod through the wheel and he'd
[51:32] stand on it and ride it you know
[51:34] that's uh uh we're not going back that
[51:37] far we're
[51:39] you know and they'd peddle it and do
[51:40] everything but now listen
[51:43] not to make a joke but to make a point
[51:48] the word beginning says to
[51:51] originate
[51:57] all right to be
[52:02] originated or being a religion
[52:05] and they need a nader see it means to
[52:09] origin it means something that had a
[52:11] point
[52:12] that at one time it seemingly didn't
[52:16] exist
[52:18] but then it moves into a position that
[52:21] can be comprehended
[52:23] into a point that you begin to see that
[52:25] it does exist
[52:30] all right see then you look back and you
[52:33] see
[52:34] that before all of this god has existed
[52:37] alone
[52:38] amen
[52:42] yet in him he had attributes
[52:47] but those attributes was his desires and
[52:49] things
[52:50] he wanted to be made manifest
[52:54] he wanted to bring him into being he
[52:56] wanted to bring his family
[52:58] into being like i said he could be
[53:01] father
[53:02] with adam and eve that's why i believe
[53:05] it like i do
[53:06] that adam had eternal life in his soul
[53:09] eve had eternal life in her soul
[53:13] and see i want that start that's the
[53:15] point i want to look at
[53:16] because that's the point when we get on
[53:18] stage two we're gonna have to see that
[53:20] man come from adam and them
[53:21] all the way to jesus what we're doing
[53:25] here
[53:25] doing this for a few more minutes
[53:27] they're just taking the point
[53:28] of trying to look at something and
[53:30] saying when did that begin
[53:34] right without looking at it it's trying
[53:36] to figure out when it began
[53:39] it's just realize that there's something
[53:41] that as it began
[53:43] it really it was beginning in me and you
[53:46] to come into being
[53:47] that's right
[53:50] not to joking with the guy but he made a
[53:52] wheel
[53:54] well you know
[53:57] things started see we think of the start
[54:00] of something is the beginning of it
[54:02] and that's true all right
[54:06] but remember there was a lot of other
[54:07] things took place before that beginning
[54:09] could come into being
[54:10] that's right and see that way you can go
[54:14] all the way back into god
[54:17] all right the author beginning or author
[54:20] an author is a person who writes a novel
[54:25] or a poem something like that
[54:29] to express their thoughts
[54:34] you know to bring those things into
[54:35] being
[54:37] so he's the beginning of the creation of
[54:39] god now here's the one point i want us
[54:41] to
[54:42] deal for just a second he's the first
[54:45] one of a kind
[54:47] the beginning is based on that basis
[54:50] he's the first one of a kind that's the
[54:53] beginning of something
[54:54] the first one of a kind whether it be
[54:56] wheel whether it be this whether it be
[54:58] that
[54:58] what it be it's the first one of a kind
[55:02] all right so then there was a time that
[55:05] our
[55:05] understanding could not comprehend that
[55:08] way of looking at something other than
[55:10] saying well they were
[55:12] yeah it finally come into being there
[55:14] but to realize that way back before that
[55:17] physical part come into being there was
[55:19] a lot of things had to
[55:20] move in to bring that physical part into
[55:22] being
[55:24] you know it had to be a lot of things
[55:27] happen over time
[55:29] time elements and all like that for god
[55:31] to be able to bring it forth
[55:33] all right now listen let's get a couple
[55:35] of these little things and we'll
[55:37] go ahead to number two
[55:44] all right
[55:48] now god created man in his own image
[55:51] his own likeness what kind of a man did
[55:54] he create
[55:56] what he created a spirit spirit man
[56:03] now what would be a spirit man
[56:09] see he didn't bring him into flesh man
[56:13] he brought him in a spirit man like
[56:16] himself
[56:19] if you look at it god can divide himself
[56:22] but never separates nothing never loses
[56:24] or in a matter of fact he gains
[56:27] that's the one thing i think of the the
[56:29] beginning of the creation of god and the
[56:30] thing
[56:31] that as god unveiled himself you realize
[56:33] every time he gives a new birth he's
[56:35] expanding himself
[56:38] when he gives a new birth to a child of
[56:40] god you know gives you the new birth
[56:42] he's expanding himself
[56:45] he's not losing ground he ain't going to
[56:47] run out his brother moat said run out of
[56:49] pieces
[56:50] and run out of god no you're not going
[56:51] to do it every time he gives it out it
[56:54] increases
[56:56] just like he took that bread and the
[56:58] fish every time he'd take that bread and
[56:59] pull it off and it down it just didn't
[57:01] carry his sins
[57:02] and it just kept increasing all right
[57:05] think on that now
[57:06] to the spirit now amen now notice
[57:09] after he had made all the creation and
[57:11] created a spirit man
[57:12] the close reading of this now to the one
[57:15] that asked the question
[57:18] that god give dominion of the cattle and
[57:20] the fishes
[57:22] and everything to this man now
[57:24] physically that's true
[57:26] mainly what's he explaining but in his
[57:29] making up there he made man in his own
[57:31] image to lead the cattle
[57:33] lead the beast of the field just like
[57:34] the holy spirit leads the believer today
[57:37] see it's more the holy spirit is the
[57:39] leader that's in you that's why
[57:41] uh i remember one time we went down
[57:44] to robert hollins and he had an old
[57:46] german shepherd that boy was rough
[57:48] and uh he was up in the back of the
[57:49] truck well i started to go around and i
[57:51] told my wife and then i said y'all go
[57:52] ahead
[57:53] and i'll stand between the dog and you
[57:55] you know if he jumps
[57:56] and brother tatum he's coming up through
[57:58] there and he walked right by me
[58:00] and he just went right and that dog went
[58:02] and i had seen him
[58:04] by the tire in jeffersonville indiana we
[58:07] were sitting up there and brother
[58:08] jeffrey says you better pull that tire
[58:09] off
[58:10] that dog had bit that tire and ripped
[58:12] out the side of it
[58:15] you know it was that tough big old
[58:17] german shepherd brother tatum walked
[58:19] right by me and he said why blackie what
[58:20] are you doing
[58:22] that dog went
[58:26] and i've seen a man up in um
[58:29] irwin tennessee do that one day the one
[58:32] that was really going reddit and he just
[58:34] walked up and laid his hand on him
[58:36] see there's something about some people
[58:38] that's different
[58:40] i ain't gonna do it i don't have it
[58:43] okay you die you go ahead but i
[58:46] i will do one thing i'll tell you say
[58:48] well if you're going to remember that
[58:50] just give me your hat
[58:53] because if you ever have trouble with a
[58:54] dog just take your hat off
[58:57] just hold it out in front of you unless
[59:00] that dog is trained he never moved no
[59:02] further
[59:04] just hold your hand behind that they say
[59:06] you can do it with a knife i've never
[59:07] done it with a knife
[59:08] i've done it with a hat they say you can
[59:11] flick a knife and do it but i'm
[59:12] my point okay creations are what we get
[59:15] listen
[59:17] he was in other words adam the first man
[59:20] in the lower creation of god now look
[59:22] where we're getting to a mystery
[59:24] a secret again today yeah we're going to
[59:26] read this again
[59:27] okay so listen that's why i said
[59:31] we go so far and i see what he's going
[59:32] i'll back up and train off on something
[59:34] else and preach on it and
[59:35] come back to it he was in other words
[59:37] adam the first man in the lower creation
[59:39] of god
[59:40] the first creation of god first creation
[59:43] was god himself
[59:45] then out of god came to logos the first
[59:48] creation was god himself
[59:52] you mean god had a beginning
[59:55] to us yeah yes to him no that's right
[1:00:00] he never had a beginning amen
[1:00:04] so what is your prophet saying see first
[1:00:07] creation was god himself
[1:00:08] in other words the first one coming into
[1:00:10] being if you're standing looking out
[1:00:12] over the banisters of time and looking
[1:00:14] back
[1:00:14] and you look back there and you see a
[1:00:16] little halo of light
[1:00:18] that's god coming into being
[1:00:23] what coming into a position that you can
[1:00:26] comprehend him
[1:00:28] you can see it a little by the eye of
[1:00:29] faith not the natural outside
[1:00:32] but you can see it you can understand
[1:00:35] him just
[1:00:35] a little but he just keeps unveiling
[1:00:37] himself and keeps on doing it
[1:00:40] see which was the son of god look at it
[1:00:45] then out of the logos which was the word
[1:00:47] in the beginning was the word the words
[1:00:48] with god and the word was god
[1:00:50] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:00:51] among us and out of the logos came forth
[1:00:54] the man
[1:00:55] the man that he's what is what man has
[1:00:56] he built the spirit man
[1:01:00] the spirit man spirit man is the first
[1:01:02] man
[1:01:03] because he first created adam in spirit
[1:01:05] man
[1:01:07] then he created genesis 2 and put him in
[1:01:10] natural
[1:01:11] body all right so adam had a beginning
[1:01:18] right of the spirit part because that
[1:01:20] was what was brought into being
[1:01:22] but he had a beginning and physical
[1:01:26] all right you say well in the beginning
[1:01:27] just means a star or something so
[1:01:29] okay adam it started here and it started
[1:01:32] here
[1:01:32] now you got two that's what i kept
[1:01:35] emphasizing the other day on that
[1:01:36] message that where you've got two
[1:01:38] creations you've got a spiritual
[1:01:40] creation
[1:01:41] and then you've got a physical creation
[1:01:44] spiritual creation
[1:01:45] is just like that what did god do
[1:01:49] he made man in his image
[1:01:54] all right what is his image spirit man
[1:01:57] all right now we're in the bible god is
[1:02:00] a spirit
[1:02:05] okay see now hold that point god
[1:02:08] is a spirit he's not just a spirit like
[1:02:12] non-existence or anything like that
[1:02:15] he's a being he's a person
[1:02:18] so that spirit man that was created in
[1:02:22] genesis
[1:02:24] was put into flesh in genesis in two
[1:02:28] was the baptism of the holy ghost or the
[1:02:30] eternal god
[1:02:34] the soul of adam was
[1:02:37] god's own being placed within adam
[1:02:43] eternal life
[1:02:46] brother so he said today he asked a
[1:02:48] question about that theophany
[1:02:50] see we're going to get into some
[1:02:51] thinking it'll take stage two and we get
[1:02:54] to a lot of doing it
[1:02:55] but still adam adam had the breath of it
[1:02:58] that spirit man that he first created
[1:03:02] was put into the physical man that was
[1:03:04] his second creation our literal creation
[1:03:07] and eve was the sign because he was in
[1:03:09] adam and he was in adam and theophany
[1:03:12] all right then she was taken and put
[1:03:15] into flesh
[1:03:17] me and when he did there you've got two
[1:03:21] creations
[1:03:22] you've got two beginnings if you
[1:03:23] understand what i'm saying i'm trying to
[1:03:25] describe
[1:03:26] a beginning when your mind is not locked
[1:03:28] on oh beginning beginning of adam was
[1:03:30] when he was made in flesh
[1:03:31] now the beginning of adam was when he
[1:03:33] was made in spirit man
[1:03:38] his spirit man that was his first
[1:03:40] beginning
[1:03:42] all right so god is the author of all
[1:03:45] creation
[1:03:46] amen
[1:03:51] he created all things spiritual and he
[1:03:53] created all things natural
[1:03:55] that's right and without him was not
[1:03:57] anything made the bible said that was
[1:03:58] made
[1:04:02] see god's first creation the first
[1:04:04] creation was god
[1:04:05] not meaning there was a time he didn't
[1:04:07] exist
[1:04:09] then all at once he jumps over into a no
[1:04:12] there was a time that they was he
[1:04:14] existed in a situation
[1:04:17] he existed in a position or do it to
[1:04:20] where that nobody could comprehend that
[1:04:23] so he then moves
[1:04:26] out of that existence because we can't
[1:04:29] comprehend him
[1:04:31] in that existence he moves
[1:04:34] into another form
[1:04:40] see bringing him toward flesh but not
[1:04:44] making him flesh we got to get that
[1:04:46] second
[1:04:46] we got to get that part in it on part
[1:04:49] two of what we'll get to
[1:04:53] we've got to get it to where we we don't
[1:04:55] have no trouble when we look up there
[1:04:57] and look at what he's saying first
[1:04:59] creation was god
[1:05:02] himself then out of god came the logos
[1:05:06] which was the son of god well now that
[1:05:09] looks like here's god and then out of
[1:05:10] god comes
[1:05:14] a son of god i got the quotes
[1:05:17] i like to bring every bit over where you
[1:05:19] can think about it wrote around said see
[1:05:21] he gave
[1:05:22] birth to his first son
[1:05:27] now remember what the bible says about
[1:05:28] him
[1:05:31] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:05:34] god
[1:05:36] when did god have a beginning physically
[1:05:38] in jesus christ
[1:05:42] right we'll get to those more in jesus
[1:05:44] christ physically in jesus christ
[1:05:45] he became a son but spiritually
[1:05:51] was when god condescended
[1:05:54] from one point to another point
[1:05:59] it's the same god i got to quote here's
[1:06:02] what the prophet said did he send his
[1:06:04] son
[1:06:05] he said no he came himself
[1:06:10] so what happened here from this did this
[1:06:13] being here become this being as another
[1:06:16] person
[1:06:17] whether it become a son no this i don't
[1:06:19] know how you're going to explain it
[1:06:22] you can't explain it no other way but
[1:06:25] then you've got to make sure you explain
[1:06:27] that it's not eternal sonship
[1:06:33] see just remember if you'll keep it in
[1:06:35] mind god
[1:06:36] never sent a son to die he
[1:06:40] came himself who came himself
[1:06:43] the great jehovah self-existing elohim
[1:06:46] that existed back there before anything
[1:06:49] ever was
[1:06:50] or whatever he moves over into another
[1:06:53] part or a being
[1:06:54] in the point of revealing himself making
[1:06:57] himself known he keeps unveiling himself
[1:06:59] unveiling himself and one day he steps
[1:07:01] into flesh
[1:07:03] the same god
[1:07:08] the same being the same person
[1:07:12] that's where you got your one god
[1:07:14] correct
[1:07:17] so you ain't got to god in three persons
[1:07:19] because we're not dealing in three
[1:07:20] persons
[1:07:23] when i look back and see god before the
[1:07:25] world i see almighty god as one
[1:07:29] amen all right
[1:07:33] now listen to what i'm saying who
[1:07:36] created
[1:07:39] now we're going to have to think a
[1:07:40] little bit when we get on to that
[1:07:42] but just remember the father never
[1:07:44] created
[1:07:47] the son created
[1:07:52] but who is the who is the son the father
[1:07:54] made manifest
[1:07:59] not another person
[1:08:03] but it's just a point of understanding
[1:08:05] see what was the next stage
[1:08:08] he explains it what in other words adam
[1:08:11] the first man in the lower creation of
[1:08:12] god
[1:08:13] the first creation was god himself then
[1:08:15] out of god came the logos
[1:08:17] which was the son of god not another
[1:08:18] person same person moves over into
[1:08:21] another form
[1:08:23] and he just keeps moving he keeps moving
[1:08:27] he comes through the old testament with
[1:08:29] the prophets and the things
[1:08:33] and he just keeps moving but one day he
[1:08:35] just stepped right out in flesh a body
[1:08:38] thou hast prepared me
[1:08:43] now that's one thing the father did
[1:08:44] create
[1:08:47] that's the best way of saying it the
[1:08:49] father did create that body because i'm
[1:08:50] quoting brother brown
[1:08:55] think on these things i'm just trying to
[1:08:57] get a point to you to think on
[1:08:59] what he's trying to do the beginning of
[1:09:02] our creation
[1:09:03] all right let's let's see go ahead
[1:09:10] let's do the number 26 stop on that one
[1:09:14] there you go this is off questions and
[1:09:16] answers
[1:09:17] it says no man has seen the father at
[1:09:20] any time
[1:09:24] now wait a minute wait a minute that man
[1:09:26] told that little boy all i've ever seen
[1:09:28] is
[1:09:31] see now you're tripping over your own
[1:09:33] feet
[1:09:34] it's not talking about that look what
[1:09:36] he's answering
[1:09:38] look no man has seen the father at any
[1:09:40] time
[1:09:41] no man can see god in the bodily
[1:09:46] form
[1:09:50] because god is not in body
[1:09:54] form
[1:09:58] god is a spirit all right no man had
[1:10:01] seen the father
[1:10:02] but the only begotten of the father hath
[1:10:05] declared him
[1:10:06] begotten
[1:10:11] adam was god's first created son
[1:10:14] jesus was god's begotten son
[1:10:19] begotten by a woman
[1:10:22] adam and eve when adam didn't come from
[1:10:24] a woman
[1:10:25] he was created but jesus came from a
[1:10:28] woman
[1:10:30] the body the flesh the man
[1:10:33] came from a woman so then he's right
[1:10:35] look what he's saying
[1:10:37] no man has seen the father
[1:10:41] you remember they said that show us the
[1:10:42] father he turned around to him he said
[1:10:44] have i been so long weed you don't
[1:10:46] know me says if you've seen me you've
[1:10:47] seen the father okay that's fine
[1:10:50] but he wasn't talking about a flesh body
[1:10:54] right it was the man inside of there
[1:10:59] that body had a beginning as a human
[1:11:01] element
[1:11:02] but the one that was inside of there was
[1:11:04] the almighty god himself
[1:11:08] the father made manifest in another form
[1:11:11] called
[1:11:12] a son amen
[1:11:17] right the father made manifest
[1:11:20] in another form called the son just keep
[1:11:23] him thoughts in mind
[1:11:24] how he just keeps unveiling himself
[1:11:28] from one thing to another because just
[1:11:31] remember
[1:11:31] there's three stages to what we're
[1:11:33] talking about
[1:11:35] stage three is you
[1:11:40] okay we ain't got there yet stage three
[1:11:42] is you
[1:11:45] because you're the beginning of the
[1:11:46] creation of god that's the message to
[1:11:48] this age
[1:11:53] not something that's going to begin
[1:11:55] something that's done already begun
[1:11:59] all right think on these things
[1:12:05] by the spiritual eye let's go to a
[1:12:07] little bit further which one
[1:12:08] we'll get 26. all right
[1:12:13] but notice now there's nothing there
[1:12:15] just space there's no light
[1:12:17] there's no dark there's no nothing it's
[1:12:19] just seems nothing but in there
[1:12:26] now i i'm like these folks i've i've
[1:12:29] always tried to understand things in a
[1:12:30] spiritual sense
[1:12:34] just remember
[1:12:37] there was no darkness there either
[1:12:42] because he was delight it wasn't a dark
[1:12:46] that's
[1:12:47] emphasis that's explaining that's trying
[1:12:50] to
[1:12:51] to get the human mind to go from a
[1:12:53] darkness to a light to
[1:12:55] understanding just remember
[1:13:00] i've never had any idea even in the
[1:13:03] trinitarian concept
[1:13:06] that it was just darkness
[1:13:10] no that's just expressing it
[1:13:14] right where he's at is light
[1:13:17] but it's a different light
[1:13:20] different from what we are see but in
[1:13:23] there as a great supernatural being
[1:13:26] jehovah god who covered all space of all
[1:13:30] places at all times
[1:13:31] he was from everlasting from everlasting
[1:13:34] he is the beginning of creation
[1:13:36] now that's the title i've picked for
[1:13:38] that because that's what he's doing
[1:13:40] when you say beginning of the creation
[1:13:42] of god you get into
[1:13:44] emphasize but when he's the beginning of
[1:13:46] creation
[1:13:49] he's the author that's god can't see
[1:13:52] nothing
[1:13:54] that's when this person had a being who
[1:13:57] was he
[1:13:58] the great supernatural being jehovah god
[1:14:00] standing there
[1:14:04] then he begins to unveil
[1:14:08] and he says let there be light
[1:14:12] um now you explain this to me one day
[1:14:16] because the bible says
[1:14:17] if you think i'm wrong on the point of
[1:14:19] emphasis think on gen
[1:14:21] on revelation when it comes down to the
[1:14:23] point that we
[1:14:24] have no need of the light
[1:14:30] what about coming to a place that didn't
[1:14:31] have no need of the light
[1:14:36] it's just an emphasis no need of the
[1:14:38] light why because he's the light
[1:14:40] and wherever he's at is going to be and
[1:14:42] wherever you're at is going to be a
[1:14:44] light
[1:14:45] not a light following you around you're
[1:14:47] not holding your little candle up
[1:14:50] no wherever you are
[1:14:53] is light because ye are the light of the
[1:14:56] world
[1:14:58] because he's the light of the world all
[1:15:00] right he is the beginning of creation
[1:15:03] that's god can't see nothing can't hear
[1:15:05] nothing
[1:15:06] not a move of an atom in the air not
[1:15:09] nothing
[1:15:10] no not no air no nothing
[1:15:14] but yet god was there that was god now
[1:15:17] let's
[1:15:17] watch for a few minutes after a while
[1:15:22] no man has seen the seen that
[1:15:26] now that's the father that's god the
[1:15:29] father what
[1:15:30] no light no nothing we think it's
[1:15:31] darkness we think it's just totally
[1:15:33] everything that is exciting no light nor
[1:15:35] nothing like that
[1:15:36] don't get that in your idea everywhere
[1:15:40] he's at his life
[1:15:43] he said brother dale you seem to
[1:15:46] have the emphasis let me put my emphasis
[1:15:48] in plain language
[1:15:50] i believe the one that existed before
[1:15:52] the world
[1:15:55] is a whole lot more real than you and i
[1:16:01] right now or anything you can do
[1:16:04] when i go back and think about in his
[1:16:06] mind
[1:16:07] i'm going back there and looking at the
[1:16:09] great eternal god
[1:16:14] amen
[1:16:17] you say do you think these things are
[1:16:19] real yeah they
[1:16:20] there's we don't need no cars when they
[1:16:22] get there
[1:16:24] but what if you push a button and go now
[1:16:25] we're in the space age when you can do
[1:16:27] different things you know
[1:16:28] what does that beam me up so what says
[1:16:31] yes scotty beam me up you know
[1:16:32] this in the space you and he go all the
[1:16:35] way up to the top floor and walks out
[1:16:37] you know
[1:16:37] i i'm not that dumb stupid they're not
[1:16:41] that dumb
[1:16:42] but i'm saying one thing for certain
[1:16:46] whatever being that you would want to
[1:16:48] call god
[1:16:50] heaven help me no words to express it
[1:16:54] he's more real than anything you and i
[1:16:57] could ever think of
[1:17:00] and he always was that
[1:17:05] you think of these uh things that they
[1:17:08] do and they put it into science and
[1:17:10] fiction movies you know where people can
[1:17:12] just run through walls they can do this
[1:17:14] they can
[1:17:15] do that and when you get through
[1:17:17] thinking about all that just remember
[1:17:18] every one of them can be stopped with a
[1:17:19] bullet
[1:17:23] but what about one who
[1:17:26] always existed
[1:17:31] he wasn't sitting back before the world
[1:17:33] well i wonder what's going on
[1:17:35] i don't know a split second
[1:17:40] he comprehended what he wanted to do i
[1:17:42] emphasized i had a split
[1:17:44] second in a split second he had it all
[1:17:47] into being
[1:17:51] he didn't have to sit down there well i
[1:17:53] wonder about this i wonder about that
[1:17:54] what should i do here what
[1:17:55] cause his first decision was the right
[1:17:57] decision
[1:18:00] ever how he made the world was the way
[1:18:01] he wanted it that's right ever how he
[1:18:03] made man was the way he wanted it
[1:18:06] he didn't have to figure it out he
[1:18:07] didn't have to sit down and think it
[1:18:10] over
[1:18:13] he was almighty god amen
[1:18:16] think on these things let's get one more
[1:18:18] all right go ahead number 28
[1:18:20] it's the next one
[1:18:23] yeah 28. no
[1:18:29] now no one has seen god
[1:18:32] okay because god is a spirit
[1:18:36] now now talk about bodily form god is a
[1:18:39] spirit
[1:18:40] all right now the next thing we begin to
[1:18:42] see
[1:18:43] by eyes of supernatural looking we see a
[1:18:45] little white light forming out there
[1:18:47] what is that that was called by bible
[1:18:50] readers
[1:18:51] logos or anointed or the anointing
[1:18:55] or as as are the as i have
[1:19:00] was going to say the part of god began
[1:19:03] to develop into something
[1:19:05] that human beings could have some
[1:19:08] type of an idea what it was
[1:19:12] it was a little light low
[1:19:15] a little light moving he that was the
[1:19:18] word
[1:19:19] he that was the word now god gave
[1:19:22] himself
[1:19:22] birth to his son
[1:19:27] is that a second person no this is when
[1:19:30] he condescends
[1:19:31] which was before there was even or not
[1:19:33] adam in there
[1:19:34] or to error to make the adam that was
[1:19:37] jesus said glorify me father with the
[1:19:39] glory that
[1:19:40] we had before the foundation of the
[1:19:42] world way back
[1:19:43] in yonder not giving birth to a son as a
[1:19:47] second person
[1:19:50] about it think about what he's saying
[1:19:54] that what he's doing he's explaining
[1:19:58] that he's coming forth
[1:20:03] there was a time that he could not be
[1:20:05] comprehended
[1:20:08] and then gradually he begins to unfold
[1:20:13] to make himself known
[1:20:18] until one day he stands on the earth as
[1:20:21] a child
[1:20:24] all the way into a human form
[1:20:29] the great eternal god
[1:20:34] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:20:35] god and you know what we are
[1:20:38] the prophet says we're the continuation
[1:20:40] of that creation
[1:20:41] we've got the quotes we're the
[1:20:44] continuation of that creation
[1:20:47] so however how he comes that's the way
[1:20:49] we come
[1:20:50] now remember he never sent a son he came
[1:20:52] himself
[1:20:57] all right what are you
[1:21:01] a child of god is god made manifest in
[1:21:04] another form
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:11] a child i'm a child of god
[1:21:15] amen so i'm gonna manifest in another
[1:21:19] form
[1:21:19] what to look like to act like and to do
[1:21:22] like and to
[1:21:23] pull it all and do it all but yet still
[1:21:26] listen
[1:21:27] god never sent a son
[1:21:32] he came himself calling jesus on the
[1:21:36] scene
[1:21:36] in body he was a man
[1:21:40] in spirit he was god that was almighty
[1:21:44] god
[1:21:44] in human flesh
[1:21:50] almighty god stood on earth in human
[1:21:53] flesh
[1:21:54] no he was a son of god
[1:21:59] the human body had to have a creator to
[1:22:01] create it
[1:22:03] but the spiritual man was inside of
[1:22:04] there was almighty god
[1:22:08] that's why i differed with the brothers
[1:22:10] when they kept bringing all that about
[1:22:12] the river jordans and the things like
[1:22:13] that
[1:22:14] you know and saying he wouldn't god
[1:22:15] until the river jordan and now
[1:22:18] he was born to emmanuel
[1:22:22] he was born lord to christ i just
[1:22:25] couldn't see what they were talking
[1:22:26] about and i still don't see what they're
[1:22:27] talking about
[1:22:28] understand wordings that they're saying
[1:22:30] but i don't understand why
[1:22:31] they would try to bring something like
[1:22:33] that right
[1:22:36] but around said a little jehovah what
[1:22:38] about a prophet look down and see
[1:22:40] something like that
[1:22:41] and he said little jehovah crying in a
[1:22:43] cradle
[1:22:45] said little jehovah with no teeth
[1:22:50] he could just keep going back little
[1:22:52] jehovah the same one that walked on the
[1:22:55] shores of galilee
[1:22:58] the same one that stood before the world
[1:23:00] ever begun and said let there be
[1:23:04] i enjoyed one time that i mean i didn't
[1:23:06] all of them but we
[1:23:07] we used to go down to the uh what was it
[1:23:09] called the passion play or what was the
[1:23:11] name of it
[1:23:12] yeah and uh we used to go a lot and i
[1:23:15] enjoyed it
[1:23:16] and one time that they they had the
[1:23:18] scene
[1:23:19] and that was the best of all i've ever
[1:23:21] seen because
[1:23:22] it showed like a whirl and rock you know
[1:23:25] things and just like
[1:23:26] and here stood a man
[1:23:30] you know let's play but get the point
[1:23:33] here's to the man and he said let there
[1:23:35] be
[1:23:37] things started bursting and bombs et
[1:23:39] cetera you can call it you know
[1:23:40] things started coming into being and
[1:23:42] forming this and forming that
[1:23:45] the next scene a little baby
[1:23:51] laying in the crate
[1:23:55] that was the same one that created
[1:24:00] amen the same one it said let there be
[1:24:04] was now laying in the cradle i said
[1:24:06] somebody
[1:24:07] caught the point you know i understood
[1:24:09] it they said it they
[1:24:10] could never use that no more because it
[1:24:12] was somebody they got a
[1:24:15] what you call it they got a copyright on
[1:24:18] to that and they could never use that
[1:24:19] again by anybody else
[1:24:21] it's a good point because that's who
[1:24:23] that was
[1:24:24] that one that was standing before the
[1:24:26] foundation of the world was almighty god
[1:24:29] not a human element flesh almighty god

[1:25:00] they were the only ones that had eternal
[1:25:01] life

[1:25:04] bring it on down to cane or nothing like
[1:25:06] that
[1:25:06] because sin entered the picture and took
[1:25:08] it away but there they were
[1:25:12] there that eternal god stood on earth
[1:25:15] in a form
[1:25:19] put that into human flesh you got adam
