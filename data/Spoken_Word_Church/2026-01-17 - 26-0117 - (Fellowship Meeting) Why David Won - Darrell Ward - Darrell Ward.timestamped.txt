[12:29] How many believe that everybody's going
[12:31] to be happy over there? How many believe
[12:33] that you should be happy now?
[12:36] As a matter of fact, you should be
[12:37] joyful now because your happiness can
[12:40] come and go. But joy, if you have the
[12:42] joy of the Lord, that'll stay no matter
[12:45] the situation, no matter the trial, no
[12:47] matter the problem. Amen. Joy is
[12:50] steadfast. Amen. Happiness can come and

[25:43] God bless you. Appreciate. Amen.
[25:49] God bless you, brother.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, come on, brother. Greet the
[25:59] people. You brought a 100 singers, so
[26:03] You all can sing. I know you can. So
[26:05] don't be smiling at me.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; I know you can.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Good to see you,
[26:12] brother.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Good to be here.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Good to see the saints of God gathering
[26:18] together.
[26:20] It's been quite a time in the message.
[26:22] Some of the old ones have seen quite the
[26:24] changes.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm it's counted the greatest
[26:28] honor in my life is to be a minister in
[26:31] this message. Amen.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brandham said
[26:34] that's the officers of the battle. And I
[26:36] liked it. We're not on a cruise ship.
[26:37] We're on a battleship.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[26:42] it's a time when we are finding out what
[26:45] the message really is.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; Because we're seeing the fulfillment of
[26:49] the accuser of the brethren come out.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; And so we are people now that are facing
[26:53] the accusation.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[26:55] &gt;&gt; Just like our Lord Jesus faced the
[26:57] accusation. You broke the law. You
[26:58] healed on the Sabbath. You told people
[27:00] to drink blood. And the scripture says,
[27:03] "Don't drink the blood of the
[27:04] sacrifice." And here we are now in this
[27:06] time facing accusation again.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; And I I have good news for us.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; This was necessary.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Don't be angry at them.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Don't be angry at Judas. Judas said to
[27:19] fulfill his part.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Don't even be angry at the Pharaoh. God
[27:23] hardened his heart.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; The message truth. We are coming to the
[27:28] understanding of it and the
[27:30] acknowledgement of it more and more as
[27:32] the days go by.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; We're finding out just what it is. And
[27:35] we we we now come we know it's more than
[27:38] a man.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; It's more than a church building. Nice
[27:42] building here. This building will be
[27:43] dust.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Great man. Brother Brandham. Brother
[27:46] Brandham's gone on and his his body lays
[27:49] in the dust and his his heart and soul's
[27:51] up in heaven.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word would last.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. My heart's been turned
[27:57] &gt;&gt; always.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it took a it it's going to
[28:01] take these things for us to become
[28:03] better warriors.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; One of the reasons why the accusations
[28:07] against the truth is hits us so hard
[28:10] because I'm used to dealing with brother
[28:13] Wade Dale, with brother Tony Oboa. They
[28:16] won't lie. You won't lie. But I want you
[28:20] to know the people speaking against the
[28:21] message have not that real brother
[28:23] Garland. They can say whatever they
[28:25] want.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; They can say, "Hey, brother Brandon was
[28:28] right next to a rocket ship and up it
[28:29] went and that made the cloud."
[28:32] &gt;&gt; And they can be convincing.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; They can even be emotional.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Because they can lie and it doesn't
[28:38] matter to them.
[28:40] &gt;&gt; So, we must do the same thing we did
[28:43] when we all got computers and we saw
[28:45] junk mail. We learn to delete it and to
[28:48] ignore it.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:50] Whatever has turned your heart to the
[28:51] Lord Jesus, cling to you like the
[28:54] precious pearl of truth and life that it
[28:57] is.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; My heart got turned.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; I can't turn it back.
[29:02] &gt;&gt; I love this message.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; It seems sweeter to me than ever.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; I always wondered why Brother Brandham
[29:10] was so nice even to the bad people.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, that's almost like
[29:15] a weakness. You know, he should be. He's
[29:17] the prophet. You know, Elijah called
[29:18] fire down from heaven. Elisha, you know,
[29:22] but brother Brandham, he had the spirit
[29:24] of Jesus Christ on him so much
[29:27] &gt;&gt; that he didn't see those people as
[29:29] enemies. He saw them as potential
[29:30] Christians and he he loved them.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; True, brother. Amen.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Can we love them?
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; If we battle carnal against carnal,
[29:38] we'll have a great carnal battle.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Be so sweet and so loving to him. What
[29:42] is the message of the hour?
[29:44] &gt;&gt; It's my favorite question in the whole
[29:45] world. It is what God is doing inside of
[29:48] you
[29:49] &gt;&gt; and how you are able to express it to
[29:52] others. That's it.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; It is the epitome of love and love
[29:55] doesn't get offended easily.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; We must be so strong within that we were
[30:01] able to express the love of God. And
[30:04] what was the love of God? We saw a lamb.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. And we are part of
[30:10] that.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; And to me, it just identifies the
[30:13] scripture. The falling away is taking
[30:15] place in our life.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Israel's become a nation in in our life.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; We heard prophecies and brother Bram
[30:23] just speaking all say oh he says in
[30:25] Tiffan Georgia he says oh when the wall
[30:27] comes down this is what's going to
[30:28] happen.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; We didn't even know what that meant
[30:30] until it come down.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; Then we oh my we are seeing things that
[30:35] the world is astounded at.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. True.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; And the world has a worldly nature.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And our flesh has what stuck
[30:44] to it? A little bit of that worldly
[30:45] nature. So it hurts us.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; That's why we had to be born again. We
[30:51] had to be revived by the word of God.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; The word would actually come into the
[30:56] womb of our soul and begin to to create
[30:59] a new nature, a new life. Yes. Praise
[31:02] the Lord.
[31:03] &gt;&gt; What's happening with all of this mess
[31:04] around the world, both political,
[31:06] military, educational,
[31:09] spiritual, is we are stepping into that
[31:12] life.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. It's never
[31:18] been more true. So, as a minister, as a
[31:21] officer of the battle, my request is
[31:24] don't hate them.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Don't try to get back at them.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; We must love them.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must actually nurture them.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; If they need a a coat, give them two
[31:36] coats. If they need you to walk a mile
[31:38] with them, walk two miles.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Express the love of God to them.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; I I can't imagine how our Lord Jesus was
[31:46] able to take that kiss on the cheek.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Where Judas walked up to the door of
[31:50] heaven, kissed that door, and turned
[31:53] around and went to hell.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So may by the grace of God
[31:58] &gt;&gt; we pull back that one sheep hanging out
[32:00] of the end of the cliff almost fallen.
[32:03] May we be able to reach down. That's the
[32:05] message I think for today. And we do
[32:07] have singers here. Our church is doing
[32:09] great.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is flourishing.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; We've been able to bring money out to
[32:14] the Ukrainian believers over to the
[32:17] Africa in Uganda. We've been able to
[32:19] help India. The work still goes on.
[32:22] We're still getting people asking
[32:23] questions. The gospel of the message is
[32:26] still producing the same thing it always
[32:28] has.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; The rumor of the messages demise was
[32:32] greatly exaggerated.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. Glad to see you here.
[32:37] Uh, musicians, come on up. Do you guys
[32:39] have a song?
[32:41] &gt;&gt; You do and David does. You want to go
[32:43] first?
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Come on up first. Ruth first.
[32:49] God bless you.
[33:18] I'm very happy to be here again and I
[33:22] Pray that in this blessed song.
[33:40] Not because I've been so faithful.
[33:46] Not because I've been so good.
[33:51] You've always been there for me,
[33:55] to provide my every need.
[34:00] You were there when I was lonely.
[34:04] You were there in all my pain.
[34:09] Guiding my footsteps,
[34:14] shelter from the rain.
[34:19] And it was you
[34:22] who made my life complete.
[34:27] You are to me my everything.
[34:32] And that is why I sing.
[34:37] Jesus. I love you.
[34:42] Because you care.
[34:46] I couldn't imagine
[34:51] if you weren't there.
[34:55] Jesus, I love you. Oh,
[35:00] because you care.
[35:04] I couldn't imagine
[35:08] if you were there.
[35:13] You are the joy of my salvation.
[35:18] You're the peace in my storm.
[35:24] Your loving arms protect me.
[35:27] You shelter me from harm.
[35:32] You are alpha and omega,
[35:36] the beginning and the end.
[35:42] my strong tower,
[35:45] my dearest and best friend.
[35:51] And it was you
[35:55] who made my life complete.
[35:59] You are to me my everything
[36:03] and that is why I sing.
[36:09] Jesus, I love you. Oh yes, I do because
[36:14] you care.
[36:18] I couldn't imagine.
[36:20] Oh no, if you weren't there,
[36:27] Jesus, I love you. I love you. I love
[36:31] you because you care.
[36:34] there. I couldn't imagine
[36:40] if you weren't there.
[36:45] Jesus, I love you. I love you. I love
[36:49] Jesus, I love you. I love you. I love
[36:53] you. Jesus, I love you. I love you. I
[36:58] love because you care.
[37:04] Jesus, I love you.
[37:51] problem. I don't know.
[37:53] Hear it. Praise the Lord. Can that thing
[37:57] hear me? You hear me?
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Through everything Satan ever tried,
[38:03] COVID and everything else, we're all
[38:05] still here today for a reason,
[38:07] &gt;&gt; for a purpose.
[38:09] difference. What is the message? It's a
[38:11] people that Satan can't stop,
[38:14] denominate, change, or pervert. We're
[38:17] still here serving the Lord Jesus
[38:18] Christ. Amen. This song was sung in a
[38:21] choir over almost 12 years ago when I
[38:24] got the Holy Ghost at Louisiana camp.
[38:26] Jesus rescues me.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm not just singing it because it's
[38:29] a song. I'm singing it because it's
[38:31] true.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:34] going through so many changes.
[38:41] What's the news for today?
[38:48] Somebody's hurt. Somebody's aching.
[38:55] Somebody's trying to find a way.
[39:02] A heavy heart can break your will.
[39:09] A troubled soul leaves time standing
[39:12] still.
[39:16] So if you're hurting, please don't hide.
[39:23] Lift up your head. I'm on your side.
[39:30] When every mountain
[39:33] seems too high
[39:37] and every river
[39:40] looks too wide.
[39:45] When my ship is lost at sea.
[39:52] That's when Jesus
[39:54] rescues me.
[39:59] My faith is strong
[40:01] and it carries me.
[40:06] Sometimes weak, I still believe.
[40:13] My life is built on this desire. Through
[40:17] the flood and through the fire,
[40:21] Jesus
[40:23] rescues me.
[40:28] I know you're looking for an answer.
[40:35] Searching for some hope to hold.
[40:42] Empty hands leave you waiting
[40:49] and praying for a miracle.
[40:56] Jesus hears your every cry.
[41:03] He sees those walls
[41:06] you can't climb.
[41:11] He will heal your hurting soul
[41:17] and lead you safely to his home.
[41:25] When every mountain
[41:28] seems too high
[41:32] and every river
[41:35] looks too high.
[41:40] When my ship is lost at sea,
[41:47] that's when Jesus
[41:49] rescues me.
[41:53] My faith is strong and it carries me.
[42:01] Sometimes we
[42:04] still believe in the message. My life is
[42:09] built on his desire.
[42:12] Through the flood and through the fire,
[42:16] Jesus
[42:18] rescues me. Sing it with me if you know
[42:20] it.
[42:22] When every mountain
[42:25] seems too high,
[42:29] every river
[42:32] looks too wide.
[42:37] When my ship is lost at sea,
[42:44] that's when Jesus
[42:46] rescues me.
[42:50] My faith is strong and it carries me.
[42:58] But sometimes we
[43:00] still believe.
[43:05] My life is built on this design.
[43:09] Through the flood and through the fire,
[43:13] Jesus
[43:15] rescues me.
[43:17] Amen.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Man, where' them little kids go? You
[43:32] used to have good grief. What do you
[43:35] feed them people up there in Sweetwater,
[43:37] Tennessee? Little old kids used to sit
[43:39] on the front row and they never would
[43:40] look at front and they always looking at
[43:42] people in the back. They're always
[43:43] making funny faces. And don't you laugh,
[43:45] David. usually the one that did it.
[43:49] Your others were better than that.
[43:53] I'll take $10 after the service. That'd
[43:56] be kind of appreciate that. But uh good
[43:59] to have them with us. They have grown
[44:00] up. We've seen we've watched them grow.
[44:02] And we sure watched them growing in the
[44:03] Lord, too, and do some miraculous
[44:05] things. And we sure appreciate the Lord
[44:06] working in their life because they sure
[44:08] are a good example. Brother Martin, come
[44:11] on up here and greet the people. If you
[44:12] got some singers sing, you can sing. I
[44:14] know you can't.
[44:17] He can sing you some songs and good to
[44:19] have brother Martin Varel from I guess
[44:22] Lawrenceville. Wouldn't we say
[44:23] Lawrenceville?
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Always good to have him. Good
[44:26] friend. God bless you, buddy.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Appreciate you. Love me. Just take it
[44:30] liberty. Good to have a young man here
[44:32] with us.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; He speaks good English.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brothers.
[44:43] And it's a pleasure to be with every
[44:44] single one of you.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; You know, I could do this in English,
[44:53] &gt;&gt; but I also see many Hispanics here.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; And I said this, well, I'm going to say
[44:59] it in Spanish.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to turn around,
[45:06] you know, and this is the priority that
[45:07] the message has.
[45:10] You know this is the variety that the
[45:11] message has
[45:14] and anywhere that you go brother
[45:19] and that family that people they believe
[45:22] the message
[45:25] you know they're not going to ask you
[45:26] what do you believe
[45:30] because they know that you believe the
[45:32] message
[45:38] and I like what brother Thomas was
[45:40] saying
[45:44] there's many things in the message
[45:49] you know brother told me when to take
[45:51] the time
[45:53] you know he told me here in the year
[45:57] so nobody could hear
[46:03] &gt;&gt; you know today I don't have any singers
[46:04] with me
[46:06] &gt;&gt; and if I sing
[46:08] you everybody's going to leave.
[46:11] So therefore, I'm not going to sing,
[46:16] you know. But I do have a a quote here
[46:19] of the message
[46:22] &gt;&gt; that helps every single one of us,
[46:27] you know, it can help us even more
[46:31] &gt;&gt; and to straighten up a little bit more
[46:34] &gt;&gt; and to obtain more strength.
[46:38] Because in this time that we're living
[46:40] in,
[46:42] &gt;&gt; you know, it's a very dangerous time.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Very dangerous.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; There's many liberals.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; There's many religious.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; There's many legalists.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; But you need to stay where?
[47:05] You have to stay right there in the
[47:06] middle.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; You have to stay in the word of God.
[47:12] You know the messenger says
[47:17] &gt;&gt; and the message
[47:21] &gt;&gt; you know and the messenger of the
[47:23] evening
[47:25] &gt;&gt; the messenger says this
[47:28] &gt;&gt; but Godivids
[47:31] you know God always works with the
[47:33] individual
[47:35] &gt;&gt; and we go to church
[47:38] &gt;&gt; and we listen to the word of Godual
[47:43] and many of the times we see that the
[47:45] other individual
[47:47] you know it doesn't put any effort
[47:50] but if that individual doesn't put any
[47:52] EFFORT
[47:54] WE also don't put IN ANY EFFORT
[47:57] YOU KNOW BUT THIS is an individual thing
[48:02] you know and God speaks to every single
[48:04] one of us
[48:05] &gt;&gt; you know it speaks to the pastor
[48:07] &gt;&gt; it speaks to the minister
[48:11] speaks to the one that is sitting there.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; You know, it speaks to every single one
[48:15] of us.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; But God always works when an individual,
[48:23] &gt;&gt; you know, he does not save you,
[48:27] you know, right here he's speaking about
[48:28] the denominations,
[48:31] you know, BAPTIST,
[48:34] you know, but now we are FAR AWAY FROM
[48:36] THAT, BROTHERS.
[48:39] YOU KNOW INSIDE OF THE message there are
[48:42] denominations now INSIDE OF THE MESSAGE
[48:46] AND you can name them.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; And when you name that denomination
[48:53] &gt;&gt; that is within the message
[48:57] like OUR BROTHER SAID HERE WHERE WAS
[48:59] JUDAS?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; He was INSIDE OF THE MESSAGE
[49:05] THERE WAS JUDAS THERE.
[49:08] WHERE WAS THAT? A CRAWL
[49:11] &gt;&gt; INSIDE OF THE ARK.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, there they were, every single
[49:15] one of them,
[49:19] &gt;&gt; you know, and denomination is not going
[49:21] to deceive you.
[49:24] But let someone come with a little book
[49:28] give you their interpretation of it.
[49:34] do not have the Holy SPIRIT
[49:38] because that is the main focus that we
[49:40] should have
[49:43] if you do not have the Holy SPIRIT
[49:47] AND you're going to be out there
[49:48] listening to any type of VOICE
[49:52] AND you're going to be there all the
[49:54] time
[49:56] and he speaks here about denominations.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; You know, Baptist doesn't save you.
[50:04] because you are a Baptist.
[50:08] You know, if you say that you believe
[50:10] the message, this you're not going to be
[50:11] saved because OF THAT.
[50:14] PENTECOSTAL.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SAVED because
[50:16] you're Pentecostal.
[50:22] And he saves you BECAUSE
[50:28] he has dealt with you personally.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Personally with you,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; personally,
[50:38] you know, I want all the pastors to send
[50:40] up, please.
[50:42] and all the pastors.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; All the preachers,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; all the preachers
[50:56] &gt;&gt; and all the preachers
[51:00] that now all the people that is sitting
[51:02] down
[51:04] and look what the messenger says here.
[51:09] And therefore, when God sent his
[51:11] prophets,
[51:14] you know, his uh messengers of the
[51:16] testament,
[51:19] he only spoke to one man,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; BUT WE AGREE ON THIS.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; HE ONLY SPOKE TO ONE man
[51:29] and that man had to bring forth the
[51:31] message.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; But from there, some other came out OF
[51:38] FROM THERE
[51:41] THEY CAME OUT OF THEIRS OTHERS
[51:43] &gt;&gt; FROM WHERE
[51:45] THE VERY SAME MESSAGE
[51:49] &gt;&gt; from the very same message.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; And they came out of THERE
[51:56] EVERYWHERE
[52:00] and bringing the MESSAGE
[52:04] THAT other message.
[52:07] And why did the message OF THE PROPHET
[52:09] CAMEOS
[52:11] &gt;&gt; AND TO TAKE us out
[52:14] &gt;&gt; and to get LOST
[52:19] &gt;&gt; NO TO TAKE US OUT
[52:22] &gt;&gt; AND PUT US IN
[52:25] WHERE HE was going TO PUT US IN
[52:28] TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY VOICES.
[52:35] BUT I GIVE THANKS TO GOD.
[52:38] BECAUSE THERE'S MEN
[52:42] &gt;&gt; that still WANT TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH
[52:44] YOU.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Now you see those things.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T SEE THE THINGS
[52:51] EYE TO EYE.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; BUT THE LOVE
[52:55] THAT THE LOVE THAT WAS WITHIN JESUS
[52:58] CHRIST
[53:00] AND EVERY SINGLE one of us.
[53:04] CAN WE GIVE AN applause to the pastors
[53:06] and ministers?
[53:09] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, GIVE GIVE THEM SUPPORT.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THEM
[53:16] &gt;&gt; as you struggle.
[53:20] THEY STRUGGLE EVEN MORE.
[53:23] YOU KNOW IN THE head
[53:26] &gt;&gt; you know if the head hurts
[53:29] &gt;&gt; you know the hands doesn't work
[53:32] doesn't work
[53:34] that's why the enemy
[53:38] that's why the enemy wants to touch them
[53:40] REACH THEM
[53:42] AND they're still standing up
[53:46] by your prayers
[53:48] &gt;&gt; may you have a seat brothers
[53:51] So it says
[53:55] &gt;&gt; bringing the same message,
[53:59] &gt;&gt; but it says
[54:02] that to be a main headquarter
[54:07] &gt;&gt; from all the pastor that stood up.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Who is the leader?
[54:14] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO LEADER
[54:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S only one leader
[54:20] &gt;&gt; and that is who. Amen.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; And we all know this.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; There is no leader among us.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; That's why there's fellowship
[54:33] because we do not belong to a
[54:35] denomination
[54:38] inside of the message, not outside.
[54:41] NOW YOUNG PEOPLE.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Now this man,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; they're advancing age.
[54:51] WE HAVE TO PASS ALONG THAT BIBLE.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Someone else needs to stand up for this
[55:00] message as well
[55:03] &gt;&gt; with this very message,
[55:06] &gt;&gt; THE OTHER MESSAGE,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; the very same message.
[55:12] And here to wrap it up,
[55:18] there also needs to be a main
[55:20] headquarter of God.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; And he's always had one
[55:27] &gt;&gt; and he say I am sure
[55:31] I'm sorry. says, "I am thankful
[55:35] that he has it here tonight."
[55:39] And that is the Holy Spirit.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; And we all know.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Now look at this.
[55:49] It's not a group,
[55:52] but is the Holy Spirit.
[55:56] It is the main headquarter of God.
[56:03] THAT is the messenger of God IN THE
[56:05] HOUR.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; The messenger,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; not William Brandom.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; He was a vessel.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; The messenger that was within William
[56:19] Brandham,
[56:22] you know, he stayed in the tomb,
[56:26] &gt;&gt; BUT THE MESSENGER
[56:28] IS STILL HERE.
[56:31] NOT IN ONE MAN ONLY,
[56:33] &gt;&gt; BUT IN A BODY
[56:35] OF A BODY of believers.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And not only just in the pastors of the
[56:41] preachers,
[56:43] but in every SINGLE ONE OF YOU, IN EVERY
[56:47] SINGLE ONE OF YOU. AMEN. She
[56:52] &gt;&gt; she HAS THE VERY SAME AUTHORITY
[56:56] &gt;&gt; to pray for for someone that is sick.
[56:58] THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; WE AGREE ON THIS
[57:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE everyone
[57:06] the body OF CHRIST
[57:09] &gt;&gt; OF THE LORD Jesus Christ.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; May the peace of the Lord be with every
[57:13] single one of you, brothers.

[59:01] We are happy to be amongst family.
[59:06] I believe that all of us are washed in
[59:08] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[59:13] because his grace has reached out unto
[59:15] us in this dur in this time
[59:21] &gt;&gt; and has brought us a message to restore
[59:22] our faith.
[59:26] We are happy because we're preaching the
[59:28] same message,

[1:03:35] But it's a joy to be in the house of
[1:03:37] Lord.
[1:03:40] And
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I went to a singing one night down in
[1:03:42] Planeville, Georgia,
[1:03:44] Planeville, Georgia,
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; great big old church.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; And there's Baptist folks.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And they'd hear heard me on the radio.
[1:03:54] This is my theme song.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; They said I would never sing that song
[1:04:01] there.
[1:04:05] But they didn't know God's plan. I did.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; And the pastor stood up
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; and said, "This is a Baptist church and
[1:04:15] we your respect."
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I respect them, but I ain't going
[1:04:23] to deny my God.
[1:04:26] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you ashamed me,
[1:04:37] So, I'll try. I got a daughter here
[1:04:40] somewhere.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; If I fall over, she can get me.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; I went to Guyana, South America one
[1:04:54] time.
[1:04:59] Not quick. I wasn't a missionary.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; They treat us like royalty. Best I'd
[1:05:06] ever been.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; But when I got off that plane, if I got
[1:05:12] back on it, I would.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; But I've been happy to be living in the
[1:05:19] United States all these years.
[1:05:26] And uh you know we're living in the best
[1:05:29] times a man could ever live in.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; All the forefathers down through looked
[1:05:37] for our day.
[1:05:42] And God so loved us.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; See I come out of Pentecost
[1:05:49] and the theme there was bless God. There
[1:05:52] ain't no man telling me what to do. God
[1:05:54] wants me to know something. He could
[1:05:55] tell me. I got the
[1:06:00] limited him a whole lot.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; But you know, and
[1:06:06] but we're living in a time that people's
[1:06:08] look for. We're living in a time where
[1:06:11] God is going to take a bride home.
[1:06:14] Amen.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Now, the church is going through
[1:06:16] tribulation. Prophet said
[1:06:20] the bride church is justified.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; And friend, I tell you, I'm 88. I'm
[1:06:25] about ready to go one way or the other.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; And ain't but one thing holding me here,
[1:06:33] and that's that little woman back there.
[1:06:40] Amen. Just had to say that, brother.
[1:06:43] Yes, sir.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; But God's been good to me.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; They want you to hold this mic.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; I sung this over in Guyana and they said
[1:06:57] there's some kids started saying it in
[1:06:59] New York. Hey, their daddy got back up
[1:07:01] there.
[1:07:06] Oh, preach the word. Word word preacher
[1:07:10] man.
[1:07:13] Preach the word, word, word. Preacher
[1:07:16] man.
[1:07:19] Heal the sick.
[1:07:22] Do it all Jesus name. Preach the word.
[1:07:26] Word word. Preach your man.
[1:07:30] Now some folks go to college and learn
[1:07:34] how to preach.
[1:07:36] Some folks go to Jesus and they get down
[1:07:40] on their knee.
[1:07:42] As for me, I'm serving the father and
[1:07:46] the son. But when you add them all up,
[1:07:50] they're all three in one. Preach the
[1:07:53] word, word, word, preacher man.
[1:07:58] Preach the word, word, word, preacher
[1:08:02] man.
[1:08:04] Heal the sick, heal the lame. Do it all
[1:08:08] in Jesus name. Preach, word, word, word.
[1:08:12] Preacher man.
[1:08:15] They go down to the river and say he'll
[1:08:19] be baptized.
[1:08:21] They take the name of Jesus and lay it
[1:08:25] on the side. They take the name of
[1:08:28] father and the name of son. But when you
[1:08:33] add them all up, they're all three in
[1:08:37] one.
[1:08:43] Heal the sick, heal the lame. Do it all
[1:08:46] in Jesus name. Preach the word. Word.
[1:08:50] Word. Preacher man.
[1:09:03] fall over.
[1:09:06] That's a good job. I remember he first
[1:09:08] came to that Lord when we first had
[1:09:09] started having fellowship meetings 20
[1:09:11] something years ago, I guess, or maybe
[1:09:17] he throwed that hand up just a little
[1:09:19] bit faster back there.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; But he believed
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; what he was singing.
[1:09:26] I love somebody that believes
[1:09:29] they're singing. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Sing the word. Preach the word. Some can
[1:09:36] sing the word.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; He does both.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; But we appreciate our
[1:09:44] some of the older ones that
[1:09:46] brother David Gadmanavid
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; said that you know, brother Brandham
[1:09:49] said that the
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; said that the young ministers
[1:09:54] would take this on.

[1:10:01] group.

[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing can separate
[1:21:29] us from the love of God that shed abroad
[1:21:32] in our heart.
[1:21:34] That's what's bringing us together.
[1:21:37] The love of God that passes all
[1:21:38] understanding
[1:21:40] everything.

[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; but we sure believe him cuz he'll never
[1:21:46] leave you, never forsake you, never tell
[1:21:50] you a lie.

[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Boy, that's somebody to depend on.
[1:21:57] Now, we're going to depend today
[1:22:00] on God bringing us a message through our
[1:22:04] brother,

[1:22:41] You won't get anything. But you expect.
[1:22:45] Brother said what? Ask for big things.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Big things. So, we're asking for a big
[1:22:51] thing today for God to just not fill us
[1:22:53] to here,
[1:22:55] but overflow
[1:22:57] into the person next to you.
[1:23:00] And if they wasn't here to get it, maybe
[1:23:02] they'll get it now.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Let's just let the word flow.

[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; What a privileged people we are.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; We're living in such a time of
[1:25:51] confusion. Yes, sir.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; People don't even know what to believe
[1:25:54] anymore
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; with all the AI and all the things
[1:25:57] that's happening. But I'm so grateful
[1:26:00] that
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; we're a people who has heard the word
[1:26:03] for this hour.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; It's not for everybody. We know that,
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; right, brother?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; But it is for the elect of God.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful privilege it is to know
[1:26:14] who we are.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Is that not right?
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Do you remember where he found you?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Amen.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Is an old building in Jonesburg,
[1:26:26] Tennessee in December the 21st, 1981.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; I'd been out drinking the night before.
[1:26:37] It's about 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon
[1:26:39] and all at once, I felt his presence
[1:26:42] come into the room. And
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I knew it was him because I felt him
[1:26:46] when I was a boy. And he spoke to me.
[1:26:50] And right there, I knelt down by myself.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Gave my heart to the Lord.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; A couple years went by and I went back
[1:26:59] to college and was witnessing. I went
[1:27:01] back on the GI Bill and was witnessing
[1:27:04] to people and they kept saying, "You're
[1:27:05] a preacher." And I said, "No, I I ain't
[1:27:07] no preacher. I just like to tell what
[1:27:09] the Lord did for me."
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:11] So about 1985, I was in a church service
[1:27:15] and this voice spoke to my heart and I
[1:27:18] took Monday off to the riverbank and I
[1:27:21] went in there and I prayed all day and I
[1:27:23] said, "Lord, if you want me to preach,
[1:27:25] if you open the door, I'll walk in it.
[1:27:27] How do you I don't know how to start
[1:27:29] preaching. I but if that's what you want
[1:27:30] me to do." And and I came in that
[1:27:33] evening and my wife said, "Brother
[1:27:34] Phillips," he was my pastor at the time,
[1:27:36] Brother Roy Phillips said, "Brother
[1:27:37] Phillips called want you to call him."
[1:27:38] And I said, I called him. I said,
[1:27:40] "Brother Phillips, this is Brother
[1:27:41] Daryl." He said, "Yeah, Brother Daryl
[1:27:43] said, I I was praying today." I said,
[1:27:45] "The Lord put on my heart to ask you to
[1:27:47] take the service Wednesday night."
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; that was did that for a few years. And
[1:27:53] then in the Lord told me when I turned
[1:27:56] 30, I'd start traveling. And so, he's
[1:27:59] been faithful.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; And this is my 26th year full-time in
[1:28:03] the ministry.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And I I know you've all heard some good
[1:28:06] preaching. You've already been here for
[1:28:07] a while. I promise you I won't I won't
[1:28:09] keep you long. And after hearing all
[1:28:11] that good preaching, I could just say
[1:28:12] amen and we could go eat.
[1:28:15] Amen. But I certainly can't preach like
[1:28:18] that. But we'll do the best we can if
[1:28:20] the Lord would just help us. If you have
[1:28:21] your Bibles, turn with us this afternoon
[1:28:23] to 1st Samuel chapter 17:4. And while
[1:28:27] you turn in there, we greet in the name
[1:28:28] of the Lord Jesus. And kind of it's such
[1:28:29] an honor to to be with you. And I was
[1:28:32] just telling brother Wade that one year
[1:28:34] ago today, we stood here in this pull
[1:28:36] pit and preached. And how fast a year
[1:28:39] goes. I I remember when I was a young
[1:28:42] boy, I told my mom, I said, "I can't
[1:28:45] wait till I get 20." And she said, "You
[1:28:47] better wait cuz you get 20, it'll be 30
[1:28:49] and 30.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; My was she ever right."
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; You young people listen to your mama,
[1:28:53] but they know what they're talking
[1:28:54] about.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. A year. It just goes by so fast.
[1:28:58] But that just means we're one year
[1:28:59] closer
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; to going home. Amen. Yes. Amen.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; And I believe we've heard the message
[1:29:04] that'll take us there.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I do too. Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel chapter 17 verse4. May the
[1:29:09] Lord bless you this afternoon. The Bible
[1:29:13] says this.
[1:29:15] And there went a champion out of the
[1:29:17] camp of the Philistines named Goliath of
[1:29:19] Gaith, whose height was six cubics in a
[1:29:21] span, which is 9 foot 9 in tall. And he
[1:29:25] had a helmet of brass upon his head. And
[1:29:27] his and he was armed with a coat of
[1:29:30] male. And the weight of the coat was
[1:29:32] 5,000 shekels of brass about 150 pounds.
[1:29:36] And he had grieavves of brass upon his
[1:29:38] legs and a target of brass between his
[1:29:40] shoulders. So the only thing he exposed
[1:29:42] was his face. Right. Right.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And the staff of his spear was like a
[1:29:47] weaver's beam. And his spearhead weighed
[1:29:49] 600 shekels of iron. And one bearing a
[1:29:52] shield went before him. And he stood and
[1:29:54] cried unto the armies of Israel, and
[1:29:56] said unto them, Why are you come out to
[1:29:58] set your battle in array? Am not I a
[1:30:00] Philistine, and ye the servants to Saul?
[1:30:04] Choose you a man for you, and let him
[1:30:07] come down to me. And if he be able to
[1:30:10] fight with me and to kill me, then we
[1:30:12] will be your servants.
[1:30:14] But if I prevail against him and kill
[1:30:16] him, then ye shall be our servants and
[1:30:19] serve us.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Philistines said, "I defy
[1:30:23] the armies of Israel this day."
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; That was the wrong thing to say.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I defy the armies of Israel this day.
[1:30:31] Give me a man that we may fight
[1:30:34] together.
[1:30:35] And when Saul and all Israel heard those
[1:30:39] words of the Philistines,
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; they were dismayed
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; and greatly afraid.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; God's army
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; afraid. Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; I want to speak for just a few minutes
[1:30:54] today on why David one.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Why David won.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:31:07] we love you, Lord.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; We are so grateful for what you have
[1:31:13] done for us.
[1:31:16] And Lord, it's such an honor to stand
[1:31:18] here in the presence of your people,
[1:31:20] Lord.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Great man of God, that we see in the
[1:31:24] audience today.
[1:31:26] But Lord, I pray that you would take
[1:31:28] this little feeble effort of ours, Lord,
[1:31:30] and speak to the hearts of your children
[1:31:31] to encourage them, Lord. For we're
[1:31:34] living in such an hour of such giants in
[1:31:36] the land.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; But oh God, there is a David among us.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray today that there be any
[1:31:44] sick. May they be healed. If they would
[1:31:45] be any weak among us, be they may they
[1:31:47] be made strong. And Lord, if there would
[1:31:49] be some that would be weary, renew their
[1:31:52] strength, oh God, we pray
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; that when we leave this building, may we
[1:31:56] say, "Did not our hearts burn within
[1:31:58] us?"
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Because the God that was with David is
[1:32:02] the God that is with us today.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, we commit this congregation and
[1:32:06] oursel into your hands for your glory in
[1:32:09] Jesus name. And the saints said,
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. You may be
[1:32:14] seated.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Now, this scripture that we read this
[1:32:18] afternoon is very familiar to us all.
[1:32:21] And no doubt we've heard it time and
[1:32:23] time again,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That when I even started reading it, you
[1:32:26] already knew the outcome. You already
[1:32:28] knew what was going to happen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; But you know, no matter how many times
[1:32:31] that we've heard it, it's still just as
[1:32:35] true. Amen.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; You see, David was a boy facing a giant,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; facing opposition much stronger than
[1:32:42] him, much bigger than him, and yet he
[1:32:45] overcame his enemy.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "Every time
[1:32:49] the devil produces a Goliath, God's got
[1:32:52] a David somewhere."
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Just always remember that. Every time
[1:32:56] there is a Goliath, there is a David.
[1:32:59] Every time the devil produces a Goliath,
[1:33:02] God produces a David.
[1:33:05] Oh, hallelujah. And let me say in this
[1:33:07] day of Goliath of cancer, Goliath of
[1:33:09] pandemics, Goliath of evil critics
[1:33:12] that's come against our message, there
[1:33:14] is a David somewhere.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Who will meet the challenge of THE HOUR?
[1:33:19] AMEN. GOD'S always had a David. He's got
[1:33:22] him today. And you see, if you look at
[1:33:24] human reasoning, human reasoning would
[1:33:26] tell you that Goliath should have won
[1:33:28] this battle.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; He was tall. David was short. He was a
[1:33:33] warrior. He was a champion warrior. He
[1:33:36] had trophies. A champion warrior. David
[1:33:40] was a sheep herder. Goliath was covered
[1:33:43] in armor.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; David was covered in sheep skin.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Who do you think Vegas would have put
[1:33:50] their money on?
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; You see, the world looks at the natural
[1:33:57] part with what they can see with the
[1:33:59] eye.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; You know, you think, how could this
[1:34:02] woman walk? The prophet said, "How could
[1:34:04] that one man ever get up out of a
[1:34:06] wheelchair, how could that man that's
[1:34:07] fixing to die in the next few days with
[1:34:09] heart trouble? How could he be made
[1:34:11] well?" Amen.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; And I like to add something to THAT AND
[1:34:13] SAY, "HOW COULD A LITTLE GIRL THAT WAS
[1:34:15] IN A TRAIN ACCIDENT WHEN EVERYBODY IN
[1:34:17] THE CAR was killed from her and they
[1:34:19] said she'd never walk again, NEVER SEE
[1:34:21] AGAIN, BUT GOD OPENED THAT LITTLE GIRL'S
[1:34:23] EYES?"
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's unreasonable. You can't
[1:34:28] reason it OUT BECAUSE GOD'S NOT KNOWN BY
[1:34:32] REASONING. GOD IS KNOWN BY FAITH.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, Satan leads a man, but
[1:34:38] what he could see with his eyes, but God
[1:34:41] chose to lead man by his heart.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; The eyes of the heart sees the unseen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; David had a slingshot. GOLIATH HAD A
[1:34:50] CHALLENGE. BUT DAVID HAD A GOD WHO COULD
[1:34:53] NOT BE DEFEATED. AMEN.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; NOW, the setting of the showdown was a
[1:34:58] valley between two hills. On one hill
[1:35:00] was the Philistines who serve gods. On
[1:35:03] the other hill was the army of Jehovah,
[1:35:05] the army of Israel. And they were
[1:35:06] trained. They were armed. THEY WERE
[1:35:08] GOD'S ARMY.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that the Philistine
[1:35:12] army had a big challenger, a big
[1:35:15] champion by the name of Goliath. And the
[1:35:17] prophet said he was 9 foot uh 9'4 in
[1:35:20] tall. And what a fellow he was. had 14
[1:35:23] inch fingers.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; From the bottom of his hand to the tip
[1:35:27] of his fingers was 28 in.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; This man could slap you on one side of
[1:35:32] the face and hit the other at the same
[1:35:34] time.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Guy walk up with red jaws said you got
[1:35:41] slapped by Goliath.
[1:35:44] What a hand that he had. AND HE COME OUT
[1:35:47] MAKING THIS BOAST. THERE'S NO need for
[1:35:49] both armies to SUFFER LOSS. JUST SEND ME
[1:35:52] OUT A MAN. YOU SEE, WHEN THE DEVIL
[1:35:54] thinks he's got the edge on you, he'll
[1:35:56] sure poke IT ON YOU IF YOU'LL LET HIM.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; And this big Goliath, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
[1:36:01] OF HIS ATTITUDE AND BECAUSE of his his
[1:36:03] statue, HE SAYS, "LET'S HAVE IT LIKE
[1:36:05] THIS. SEND ME OUT A MAN WHO'LL FIGHT
[1:36:08] ME." YOU SEE, GOLIATH WANTED a man.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; God gave him a boy.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? GOD DON'T NEED
[1:36:19] SOMETHING BIG. HE JUST NEEDS something
[1:36:23] yielded.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I just think Goliath wanted a
[1:36:29] man. God said, "Watch this." He gave him
[1:36:32] A BOY, A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY. THEN WHAT DOES
[1:36:35] THAT TELL? IT TELLS ME OUR YOUNG PEOPLE
[1:36:37] DON'T HAVE TO GROW old before they can
[1:36:38] do something for God. YOU CAN DO
[1:36:40] SOMETHING FOR GOD RIGHT NOW. AMEN.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You see, now if any man in
[1:36:46] the whole army of Israel was able to go
[1:36:49] up against this man, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:36:51] SAUL.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; HE WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE EVERY
[1:36:54] MAN IN THE ARMY.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He was closer to Goliath's size than any
[1:36:58] man in the army. He knew how to fight.
[1:37:00] He knew how to maneuver a spear. He knew
[1:37:02] how to raise a shield to knock the lick
[1:37:04] off. He trained men. He was a bishop. He
[1:37:06] knew what he was doing.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; So if anybody should have went up there,
[1:37:10] it should have been Saul. Y
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD NEVER CHOSE SAUL. GOD CHOSE
[1:37:17] DAVID.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD HAS CHOSE YOU TO DO
[1:37:19] SOMETHING, THEY NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR
[1:37:22] PLACE. AMEN.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; IF GOD'S CALLED YOU TO PREACH, PREACH.
[1:37:27] IF GOD'S CALLED YOU TO AMEN. AMEN. IF
[1:37:30] GOD'S CALLED YOU TO SING, SING FOR THE
[1:37:32] GLORY OF GOD. BUT BE WHAT GOD CALLED YOU
[1:37:34] BECAUSE NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; You was born for a purpose.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And when Saul and
[1:37:43] all the of Israel heard the words OF THE
[1:37:45] PHILISTINES, THE BIBLE SAID they were
[1:37:47] dismayed and greatly afraid.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; How can that be?
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOD'S ARMY.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; THEY REPRESENT. HOW COULD THEY BE
[1:37:59] SCARED? HOW COULD THEY BE SO DISMAYED?
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY LACK SOMETHING. THEY DIDN'T
[1:38:07] HAVE WHAT DAVID HAD. AMEN.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; They failed to see who they were in the
[1:38:12] word.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; You see, JESUS HAD PERFECT FAITH BECAUSE
[1:38:18] HE KNEW WHO HE WAS IN THE WORD. AND WHAT
[1:38:20] DID GOD SEND A PROPHET FOR IN THIS HOUR?
[1:38:22] NOT JUST TO TELL US WHO BROTHER BENHAM
[1:38:24] WAS, BUT TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, do you love him today?
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; THEY LACKED WHAT JOSHUA AND WHAT CALEB
[1:38:35] HAD. YOU SEE JOSHUA AND CALEB, THEY HAD
[1:38:38] A REVELATION.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. When they went over and they came
[1:38:44] back with the report, you know, oh,
[1:38:45] we're like grasshoppers in their eyes.
[1:38:47] It's it's too big. They got walled off
[1:38:49] cities and oh, it's just too much. And
[1:38:51] the people WAILED AND CRIED, THEY
[1:38:52] ALREADY GAVE UP. BUT JOSHUA AND CALEB
[1:38:54] STAND THERE SAID, WE CAN DO IT.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS IS OUR LAND. GOD PROMISED WE
[1:38:59] COULD DO IT. GOD SAID WE COULD DO IT.
[1:39:01] GOD PROMISED OUR FATHERS WE WERE GOING
[1:39:03] OVER. THIS IS OUR LAND. IT BELONGS TO
[1:39:05] US.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO TELL THE DEVIL WHAT BELONGS
[1:39:08] TO YOU. EVERYTHING JESUS DIED FOR AT
[1:39:11] CALVARY IS IN YOUR POSSESSION. AMEN.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; It don't matter if they got walled
[1:39:17] cities. It don't matter how big they
[1:39:19] are. IT DON'T MATTER how trained they
[1:39:20] are. ALL THAT MATTERS IS YOU KNOW WHO
[1:39:22] YOU ARE.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see, when you quit
[1:39:28] looking at the giants and start looking
[1:39:30] at God's word, but the devil always
[1:39:32] wants you to get your eyes off the word
[1:39:34] and to LOOK AT THE GIANTS. As long as as
[1:39:37] long as your eyes see the size OF THE
[1:39:39] GIANTS, THAT'S all the devil wants you
[1:39:41] to see.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; As long as you look at the cancer,
[1:39:44] THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER HAVE. AS LONG AS
[1:39:46] YOU LOOK AT THAT MARITAL TROUBLE, THAT'S
[1:39:47] ALL YOU'LL EVER HAVE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:39:49] QUIT LOOKING AT THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO QUIT
[1:39:51] LOOKING AT THE SYMPTOMS and look at the
[1:39:53] word.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; The word says you're already healed.
[1:39:55] Every person in this BUILDING IS ALREADY
[1:39:58] HEALED RIGHT NOW. AMEN.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:04] Every man knows today. Oh my. He can
[1:40:06] take the name of Jesus. Why? Because all
[1:40:09] things are subject to Jesus and Christ.
[1:40:11] The prophet said when men and women quit
[1:40:13] looking at their sickness and their
[1:40:14] diseases and start looking to what God
[1:40:16] said about it, they will take over. I
[1:40:18] SAY IT'S TIME WE TAKE OVER. AMEN.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; All things are subject to Jesus Christ.
[1:40:23] And all things are subject to you in
[1:40:25] prayer when you ask in the name of Jesus
[1:40:28] and believe.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ASK. YOU'VE GOT to
[1:40:34] believe.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:38] How do we know? How do we know Noah
[1:40:40] believed God when God said it was going
[1:40:42] to rain? How do we know he believed him?
[1:40:44] BECAUSE HE BUILT THE ARK BEFORE THE RAIN
[1:40:45] FELL.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to say, "I'm a
[1:40:48] believer." YOU MUST PUT THAT INTO
[1:40:50] ACTION. AMEN.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. All things are subject to you in
[1:40:57] prayer. When you ask in his name and
[1:40:59] believe.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask what you will in my name,
[1:41:03] it'll be done. That's right. Whatsoever
[1:41:05] thing you desire when you pray, receive
[1:41:07] it, you shall have it.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; God said so. Let nothing stand in YOUR
[1:41:11] WAY. STOP LOOKING AT THE things you're
[1:41:13] looking at here. Look at the unseen.
[1:41:15] Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "HOW DO BROTHER, BROTHER, HOW
[1:41:19] DO YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RAPTURE?" GOD
[1:41:21] SAID WE WAS.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; That's good ENOUGH FOR ME. WELL, I DON'T
[1:41:24] FEEL IT. HE NEVER SAID, "DID YOU FEEL
[1:41:26] IT?" He said, "DID YOU BELIEVE IT?"
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT, YOU ACTUALLY MAY
[1:41:30] START FEELING IT.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; LOOK, God gave Moses a stick. How
[1:41:40] ridiculous that was to the world.
[1:41:43] He gave Shabgard an ox goat. He gave
[1:41:46] Samson a jawbone.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; But he's gave us
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; his name.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; What did Satan do? The first thing he
[1:41:54] done, he took the name of Jesus out of
[1:41:57] the church and GAVE THE CHURCH TITLES.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; But what HAS GOD DONE IN THIS DAY? HE
[1:42:03] SENT A PROPHET TO RESTORE US. WHAT? BACK
[1:42:05] TO THE WORD. AND WHAT DID HE BRING BACK
[1:42:07] TO US? THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "You take on the
[1:42:12] characteristics of that name."
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Abram would have never been father of
[1:42:16] nations UNTIL HIS NAME WAS CHANGED TO
[1:42:18] ABRAHAM.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Elvis means cat and Ricky
[1:42:23] means rat." And that boy named Ricky the
[1:42:24] prophet said, "CHANGE HIS NAME AND WATCH
[1:42:26] WHAT HAPPENS to him
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; because you take on the characteristics
[1:42:31] of your name." So if we TAKE ON THAT
[1:42:33] NAME OF JESUS,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; we are not an organization. We are not a
[1:42:38] denomination. WE ARE NOT A MAN FOLLOWER.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; OH, do you love him?
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; There's power in the name of Jesus.
[1:42:54] Every man today knows he can take the
[1:42:57] name of Jesus Christ and meet any foe,
[1:43:00] any place, any time, and he will be
[1:43:03] defeated.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; I've met witch doctors. I've met demons
[1:43:06] of all sort. And I've never seen a time
[1:43:08] by what they bowed to the name of Jesus
[1:43:10] Christ.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, when the church lost
[1:43:13] the name and the power of the name of
[1:43:15] Jesus Christ, they lost it.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; When Moses went down to Egypt, if they
[1:43:18] had ever got that stick out of his hand,
[1:43:20] that had him whipped. But in that stick
[1:43:22] was where the power laid. If they ever
[1:43:24] got the stick out of his hand, they had
[1:43:26] him whipped. Remember, IT WAS THE STICK
[1:43:28] that smoked the rock. It was the stick
[1:43:29] that held in the air. It was the stick
[1:43:31] that he held over the water. IT WAS
[1:43:32] GOD'S JUDGMENT ROD. AND WHAT THAT STICK
[1:43:35] was in Moses HAND. THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:43:37] CHRIST IS TO THE BORN AGAIN CHURCH
[1:43:39] TODAY. AMEN.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. You can take that name.
[1:43:44] THE NAME OF JESUS SAY, SATAN, GET OFF MY
[1:43:46] PROPERTY.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; GET OFF MY FAMILY.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; GET OFF MY CHURCH.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:54] OH, do you love him?
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, the name of Jesus. Take the name of
[1:44:01] Jesus with you, child of sorrow and of
[1:44:03] woe. When temptation rounds you gathers,
[1:44:06] breathe that holy name in prayer
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; and watch demons scatter.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see, we meet our giants in
[1:44:18] the name of Jesus.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; I don't meet them in my ability. I ain't
[1:44:22] got no ability. I don't meet him in my
[1:44:23] education. I ain't got no education. BUT
[1:44:25] I MEET HIM. HALLELUJAH. In the NAME OF
[1:44:27] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:30] And when THAT NAME WAS FIRST EVER SPOKE,
[1:44:32] A BABY THAT WAS DEAD IN ITS MOTHER'S
[1:44:34] WOMB, leaped inside the womb.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You meet me, Philistine, with
[1:44:40] armor and a spear, David said. But I
[1:44:42] meet you in the name of the Lord, God of
[1:44:43] Israel. And the Jesus of the New
[1:44:45] Testament is Jehovah of the Old. He only
[1:44:47] changed HIS MASK FROM SPIRIT TO MAN.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; David knew where he was standing. He
[1:44:52] knew how to meet him. Amen. And we know
[1:44:54] how to meet OUR GOLIATH IN THIS HOUR. WE
[1:44:56] MEET HIM IN THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; David said, "You meet me as a Philistine
[1:45:02] with armor and a spear, but I meet you
[1:45:04] in the name of the Lord, God of Israel."
[1:45:05] He had five stones, five fingers, and a
[1:45:08] sling wrapped in G J su f a i t h faith
[1:45:11] in Jesus. And here he comes. SOMETHING
[1:45:13] HAD TO HAPPEN. I TELL YOU, when you turn
[1:45:15] that stone loose, the spirit of God
[1:45:17] called into that stone and slew Goliath
[1:45:19] and cut his head off. And all the other
[1:45:21] Philistines was weakened down.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And the armies of Israel took courage
[1:45:24] and they cut the Philistines PLUGGED TO
[1:45:26] THE WALL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
[1:45:28] TONIGHT IS SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT AN
[1:45:30] EXPERIENCE TO STAND UP AND TO PROVE THE
[1:45:32] POWER OF THE resurrection of Jesus
[1:45:34] Christ. You see it's listen to me. It's
[1:45:36] not ENOUGH TO SAY I'M IN THE MESSAGE.
[1:45:38] THE MESSAGE MUST BE IN YOU.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. The rest of them will
[1:45:46] take courage. And here they'll come.
[1:45:48] Some of you on the CS, he said the
[1:45:49] prophet said some of you in wheelchairs
[1:45:51] JUST TRY IT ONCE AND WATCH THAT GROUP
[1:45:53] FOLLOW YOU. TAKE COURAGE. OH, brother
[1:45:56] saints of God. I was in Oklahoma and we
[1:45:58] had at the end of the service we just
[1:45:59] had a prayer for everybody and the
[1:46:00] sister had a tennis elbow and she
[1:46:02] couldn't clap her hands because it hurt
[1:46:03] real bad and so the people just laid
[1:46:05] hands on one another and she was the
[1:46:07] people prayed and when they got done and
[1:46:08] said amen she said the people started
[1:46:10] clapping and she started clapping her
[1:46:12] hands she go it don't hurt
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; it don't hurt I couldn't do that before
[1:46:16] and she started praising GOD CUZ GOD HAD
[1:46:18] HEALED HER RIGHT THERE AND THE DOOR
[1:46:19] OPENED and people started stepping in it
[1:46:21] and a cancer disappeared off OF A
[1:46:23] WOMAN'S LEG WHY BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS
[1:46:25] OPEN AND IF FAKE AND RADIATED IN THIS
[1:46:27] BUILDING TODAY. I TELL YOU THERE IS
[1:46:29] NOTHING. AMEN.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; What God will prove himself to be the
[1:46:35] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason David won, when David
[1:46:42] went to meet Goliath, Goliath looked at
[1:46:44] him and laughed at him,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; made fun of him. Sound familiar?
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And he said, "WHY AM I A DOG? YOU COME
[1:46:54] out to meet me. A little old ruddy
[1:46:57] looking boy. Probably said the little
[1:46:59] rucky, you know, Saul called him a
[1:47:01] strap.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; that's what Saul said. Who is that strap
[1:47:04] out there? Just that little old kid
[1:47:06] like, you know, little old looking
[1:47:08] fell probably shoulder stooped over.
[1:47:09] Think about this. Saul, THE CAPTAIN OF
[1:47:12] THE ARMY. AND Goliath was in agreement
[1:47:16] about David's
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; qualification.
[1:47:21] Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Never take sides with the devil. Yeah.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; You talk about discouragement. He was
[1:47:29] the Saul, the leader OF THE ARMY, WAS
[1:47:33] TRYING TO DISCOURAGE. WHAT? DAVID,
[1:47:34] YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOURSELF KILLED.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about that. But let me tell
[1:47:42] you, young people, let me tell you,
[1:47:43] mama, daddy, DON'T LET NOBODY DISCOURAGE
[1:47:45] YOU. KNOW WHO YOU ARE. KNOW WHAT GOD DID
[1:47:48] FOR YOU. STAND ON IT. AMEN.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Let them laugh. LET THE CRITICS SAY WHAT
[1:47:52] THEY'LL SAY. YEAH.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; God will prove his people.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Saul said, "Take my armor. It's the best
[1:47:59] made. It was so good. Oh my. You if
[1:48:02] you're going to go out there, take this.
[1:48:03] I've got the best helmet. I've got the
[1:48:04] best shield." Well, if it was SO GOOD,
[1:48:06] WHY DIDN'T he use it?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Huh.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; He tried to give it to David.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Dressed him all up in that big old heavy
[1:48:14] armor. IT DIDN'T FIT DAVID.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; DAVID SAID, "TAKE IT OFF OF ME." I'VE
[1:48:18] NEVER PROVED THAT.
[1:48:20] AMEN.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'LL
[1:48:22] STAND ON WHAT GOD HAS PROVED IN THIS
[1:48:24] HOUR TO BE THE TRUTH. AMEN.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:48:30] They said, "Just let me go.
[1:48:33] I know what I'm about. I know what I'm
[1:48:34] talking about."
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what we need today.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have a great big
[1:48:39] education to know a whole lot of things.
[1:48:41] The only thing you have to know is the
[1:48:43] power of the resurrection OF JESUS
[1:48:45] CHRIST.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; LET ME GO WITH THAT. THAT SAVED ME FROM
[1:48:48] SIN. IT HEALED ME OF MY SICKNESS. THAT'S
[1:48:50] ALL I NEED TO KNOW. I WAS A DRUNK AND HE
[1:48:52] SAVED ME. I WAS LOST AND HE FOUND ME.
[1:48:54] COME ON, SOMEBODY. THAT'S ALL I NEED TO
[1:48:56] KNOW. IF GOD DONE IT ONCE, HE CAN DO IT
[1:48:58] AGAIN. IF GOD HEALED ME ONCE, HE CAN
[1:49:00] HEAL ME AGAIN. IF GOD DELIVERED ME ONCE,
[1:49:02] HE can deliver me again. Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Then why do I HAVE TO WORRY? WHY DO I
[1:49:06] HAVE TO FEAR? I CAN STAND HERE KNOWING
[1:49:08] THAT MY GOD IS TRUE.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:14] Oh my. Amen.
[1:49:18] know him in the power of his
[1:49:19] resurrection. Be his witness. David
[1:49:22] said, "Let me go." He took off all that
[1:49:24] old armor. I don't need that stuff.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Walked out there, crossed over a little
[1:49:29] branch, PICKED UP FIVE STONES. Five
[1:49:33] smooth stones. But I want you to
[1:49:36] understand, David didn't pick up five
[1:49:37] stones in case he missed four times.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; He picked up five stones because Goliath
[1:49:44] had four brothers and David said, "I'll
[1:49:46] just kill them all."
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith we need today.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'll just TAKE THE
[1:49:55] WHOLE BUNCH of them. AMEN.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; GOD'S METHOD IS TO CAST OUT EVIL. CAST
[1:49:59] DOWN REASON. CAST DOWN SUPERSTITION.
[1:50:01] CAST DOWN WEARINESS. CAST DOWN DISTRESS.
[1:50:03] AMEN. WE'RE ABOVE IT. RESURRECTED IN
[1:50:06] CHRIST JESUS SAID IN HEAVENLY PLACES
[1:50:07] with every devil under your foot.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Did you hear WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? THE
[1:50:12] PROPHET SAID, "EVERY DEVIL IS UNDER YOUR
[1:50:14] FOOT." AMEN.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Then what do you need to do? Stomp him
[1:50:18] down.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Here a few years ago when my daughter
[1:50:22] Ally was a little old girl, I was
[1:50:23] preaching up in Kentucky. We standing
[1:50:25] outside and I she's standing beside me
[1:50:27] about like this and I was talking to the
[1:50:29] brother and Ally goes and I looked at
[1:50:32] her. I said, "What?" And I said
[1:50:35] something else. She goes, and she goes,
[1:50:38] I said, "Ally, you're ruining my
[1:50:40] ministry."
[1:50:42] I said, "What are you doing?" She goes,
[1:50:44] "It's a bug, daddy. It's a bug." And I
[1:50:46] looked down, this bug was running around
[1:50:48] and she's trying to stomp it. And you
[1:50:49] need THAT'S MY THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO
[1:50:51] UNDERSTAND. THE DEVIL AIN'T NOTHING BUT
[1:50:53] A BUG. YOU NEED TO PUT HIM UNDER YOUR
[1:50:55] FOOT. AMEN.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; WELL, IF I WAS A PREACHER, YOU DON'T
[1:50:57] NEED TO BE A PREACHER. WELL, IF I WAS A
[1:50:59] PROPHET, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PROPHET.
[1:51:00] JUST BE A BELIEVER IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:51:03] CHRIST.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Every devil, whether we're young,
[1:51:07] WHETHER WE'RE OLD, WHITE, BLACK, RED,
[1:51:09] YELLOW, IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE.
[1:51:11] EVERY DEVIL IS UNDER our feet. Amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; You need to tell the devil, "Hey, oh
[1:51:16] boy, you are under my feet."
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wrapped that little old sling
[1:51:22] around five fingers, dropped that stone
[1:51:24] into it. Here he come. Goliath made a
[1:51:27] mockery at him. Said, "Am I A DOG?"
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; "AM I A DOG THAT YOU'D SEND THAT A BOY?"
[1:51:34] David goes, "Bow!" Wow.
[1:51:39] Amen.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Here he come with a sling. Here he come
[1:51:44] with a sling against the man who had
[1:51:47] over 200 lb of armor
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; and A CHAMPION WARRIOR, 9 FOOT 9 IN
[1:51:52] TALL, 28 IN HAND.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; And here David come with a slingshot.
[1:51:57] Not an M16, not a grenade launcher, a
[1:52:01] piece of leather with a stone in it.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; But little AS MUCH OF GOD IS IN IT.
[1:52:09] AMEN.
[1:52:11] What was the difference? HE WASN'T
[1:52:13] TRUSTING in the leather. HE WASN'T
[1:52:14] TRUSTING in the stone. HE WAS TRUSTING
[1:52:16] IN THE GOD HE KNEW.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; AND THIS GOD SAID, "YOU WILL REIGN AS A
[1:52:20] KING." HOW CAN HE DIE BY A GIANT AND
[1:52:22] REIGN AS A KING? SO HE TOOK WHAT GOD
[1:52:24] SAID OVER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:30] AMEN. OH, do you love him today?
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Here he come. that probably sit with
[1:52:35] this little sling, but he knew God.
[1:52:36] That's the main thing. He was a
[1:52:38] believer. Here's why I believe David
[1:52:39] won. He was a believer. He was elected.
[1:52:42] He was called. He was anointed. And he
[1:52:44] was placed.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; And no matter whether you're young or
[1:52:47] old, TALL OR SHORT, IF GOD HAS CALLED
[1:52:49] YOU FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS, YOU ARE
[1:52:52] UNDEFEABLE.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WILL NOT BE
[1:52:56] DEFEATED.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T SURVIVE LEONA. WE OVERCOME
[1:53:00] LEONA.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. CALLED, CHOSEN,
[1:53:08] ANOINTED, placed for such a time as
[1:53:10] this.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; He didn't put me in Luther's DAY. HE
[1:53:13] DIDN'T PUT ME IN WESLEY'S DAY. HE PUT ME
[1:53:15] IN THIS DAY, THIS HOUR.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:19] AMEN.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Whenever Satan comes at you, Satan tries
[1:53:27] to put something at you, you know where
[1:53:29] you're at. When you realize God has
[1:53:31] revealed this truth to you. When you
[1:53:33] REALIZE THIS GOD, THIS MESSAGE THAT WE
[1:53:35] SERVE IS THE MIND of God. THINK ABOUT
[1:53:36] IT. THE PROPHET SAID, "WHAT WAS ONCE
[1:53:38] GOD'S GREAT MYSTERIOUS SECRET THAT WAS
[1:53:40] IN HIS MIND, BUT IT AIN'T IN HIS MIND NO
[1:53:42] MORE, IT USED TO be in HIS MIND, BUT IT
[1:53:44] AIN'T THERE. SO WHERE IS THAT MYSTERIOUS
[1:53:46] SECRET?" THE PROPHET SAID, "IT'S IN THE
[1:53:48] HEART OF THE BELIEVER TODAY."
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; When Jesus ascended with the open book,
[1:53:54] what did he do? He gave THE BOOK TO
[1:53:56] JOHN. WHO DOES JOHN TYPE? THE BRIDE. AND
[1:53:58] WHAT DID JOHN DO WITH THE BOOK? HE
[1:54:00] DIDN'T PUT IT UP ON THE BOOKSHELF. HE
[1:54:02] ATE THE BOOK AND HIM AND THE BOOK became
[1:54:04] one.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Somebody could have said, "What happened
[1:54:07] to that book?" Said, "John got it. What
[1:54:10] did what what did it say?" ASK JOHN. HE
[1:54:12] ATE IT.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Him and the book became one. And the
[1:54:18] revelation of Jesus CHRIST HAS BECOME
[1:54:21] ONE WITH US.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; ALL GOD WAS HE POURED INTO CHRIST.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; And all Christ is, he has poured into
[1:54:28] his church.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] Christ is the mystery OF GOD REVEALED,
[1:54:32] BUT THE BRIDE IS THE REVELATION of where
[1:54:35] Jesus Christ is.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother D, I can only see Jesus. I'm
[1:54:39] trying to tell you, he's sitting right
[1:54:41] beside you.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; He's just changed his mask.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Well, glory.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world going to
[1:54:53] defeat you in it. That's all. You're
[1:54:55] absolutely undefeable. Not you, NOT
[1:54:58] THIS,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; BUT THE GOD that's in me.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Not Christ, not the body, BUT THE WORD
[1:55:05] THAT WAS IN HIM.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT WAS IN CHRIST.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Not Mary, but the word THAT WAS
[1:55:12] BORN FROM HER. Oh my. Them fellas up
[1:55:14] there, they couldn't understand it. BUT
[1:55:16] DAVID HAD THE ANOINTING ALL UPON HIM. HE
[1:55:18] KNEW WHERE HE WAS STANDING.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; OH, GOLIATH STOOD OUT THERE WITH A BIG
[1:55:23] BOAST.
[1:55:26] But David had a revelation.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; DAVID WAS ANOINTED BY A PROPHET WHO GAVE
[1:55:34] HIM A REVELATION OF WHAT HIS PURPOSE WAS
[1:55:36] FOR BEING UPON the earth. AND THE BRIDE
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN ANOINTED BY A PROPHET'S
[1:55:42] MINISTRY WITH THE revelation
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; of what she is upon the earth.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. God stood out with this big
[1:55:52] boast. He said, "Oh yeah, brother. I did
[1:55:55] it in them days, but the days of
[1:55:56] miracles has passed. Oh yeah, he done it
[1:55:58] brother Brandham's day, but but he ain't
[1:56:00] doing it no more. That's a lie.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't stop with brother Brandham.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; It's now in the bride.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Elisha, it represents the church. AND
[1:56:15] WHAT DID THE CHURCH RECEIVE? A DOUBLE
[1:56:17] PORTION.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU TELL ME HE CAN'T DO IT.
[1:56:20] THERE'S SOME Jehovah some some Church of
[1:56:22] Christ boys wanted to debate me over
[1:56:24] divine healing. I said you come too late
[1:56:26] to tell me God DON'T HEAL NO MORE. IF
[1:56:28] YOUR GOD CAN'T HEAL IF HE'S too puny TO
[1:56:30] HEAL, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. BUT MY GOD
[1:56:32] STILL HEALS.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; I've seen cancers disappear. I'VE SEEN
[1:56:35] BLINDED EYES COME OPEN. I'VE SEEN THE
[1:56:37] LAME WALK. AMEN. I HAD NOTHING TO DO
[1:56:39] with it. I was just a witness when it
[1:56:41] happened. I'VE SEEN THE DEAD RAISE.
[1:56:43] THERE IS NOTHING THAT MY GOD CANNOT DO.
[1:56:50] I was in a meeting in New Mexico and my
[1:56:52] back went out on me and I laid two days
[1:56:54] in a in a hotel room on the floor on a
[1:56:57] bag of ice with my feet up in a chair
[1:56:59] and I I set the door so brother Juel
[1:57:01] Fory could bring food to me because I
[1:57:03] wouldn't even get up and go eat and I
[1:57:04] had to preach
[1:57:06] and brother Jules said, "Brother, if you
[1:57:08] can't preach," he said, "I'll take your
[1:57:10] service and you can and I preach
[1:57:12] Saturday night. It'll give you a couple
[1:57:13] more days to heal up." I said, "Let me
[1:57:14] pray about And I text a few brothers and
[1:57:16] asked him to pray and they just came on
[1:57:18] my heart and I told brother Juel I said
[1:57:20] I'm going to preach tonight. He text
[1:57:22] back. He said, "Oh boy."
[1:57:26] And I was laying on the floor and I
[1:57:27] began to cry and I said, "God, don't
[1:57:29] make me stand in front of you people
[1:57:30] like this."
[1:57:33] And it come time to go. It was all I
[1:57:34] could do to get up and get in the car.
[1:57:36] And when I got to the church, had to
[1:57:37] climb steps to get to the study. I was
[1:57:39] hurting so bad. I couldn't stand it. And
[1:57:42] the brother, you know, was talking to
[1:57:43] me. And when he went out, I took my
[1:57:45] shoes off and laid in the floor, put my
[1:57:46] feet up in a chair trying to get some
[1:57:48] rest. Kind called me to the pull pit. I
[1:57:50] come to the pull pit. I turned around. I
[1:57:52] was white knuckled just I was afraid to
[1:57:53] let go, brother Wade. I afraid I was
[1:57:55] going to fall.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And all at once, GOD IS MY WITNESS. I
[1:57:59] FELT a hand touch me on the back.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; And I thought it was a song leader
[1:58:03] telling me that my microphone wasn't on.
[1:58:05] And I turned around and when I did,
[1:58:07] there was nobody behind me.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; But it WAS A HAND. I FELT THE HAND. I
[1:58:10] THOUGHT THAT'S ODD. AND I TURNED BACK
[1:58:12] AROUND. IT WAS LIKE TWO warm vials of
[1:58:14] water JUST POURED DOWN. IT WAS OVER.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I KNOW. HALLELUJAH. GOD'S ABLE TO TOUCH
[1:58:20] EVERY PERSON IN THIS BUILDING THIS
[1:58:22] AFTERNOON.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We went from two days laying in
[1:58:27] the floor to a prayer line that night by
[1:58:29] the power of a God who cannot fail.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It may be over for some people,
[1:58:35] but it not for David. Not for the David
[1:58:37] of the day. He knew where he was. He
[1:58:39] knew he was positionally placed. He know
[1:58:41] where he was at. Hallelujah. Every David
[1:58:44] SITTING HERE TONIGHT, YOU'RE
[1:58:45] POSITIONALLY IN CHRIST. GOD HAS
[1:58:46] CONFIRMED IT. ELECTION, CALLING,
[1:58:48] ANOINTING, PLACING. He elected you and
[1:58:50] called you. HE ELECTED YOU AND CALLED
[1:58:52] YOU. THEN HE ANOINTED YOU WITH THE HOLY
[1:58:54] SPIRIT. And now he's PLACED YOU IN THE
[1:58:56] BODY OF CHRIST. AND EACH ONE OF THESE
[1:58:58] DAVIDS.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; OH, we need a David OF THE DAY, BROTHER
[1:59:02] D. WHERE IS THE DAVID OF TODAY? IT'S NOT
[1:59:04] ONE MAN. IT'S A BODY MOVE.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; The David OF TODAY IS YOU.
[1:59:10] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Where's that Goliath? Where's that
[1:59:16] cancer that's eating you up? That
[1:59:17] tumor's hanging on you. Them cataracts,
[1:59:20] that crippled arm, everything looks at
[1:59:22] it and says it can't be done.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; But when they say it can't be done, God
[1:59:26] says it can be.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Devil says you might as well keep
[1:59:32] believing. You might as well settle down
[1:59:34] cuz you ain't going to get no more.
[1:59:35] Well,
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Your doctor said so. All the rest of
[1:59:38] them said so. You can't get well.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; But with God,
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; nothing shall be impossible.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; God says you're healed. God says you're
[1:59:52] healed. The doctor says, "I'm sorry."
[1:59:54] The doctor says there's nothing more I
[1:59:56] can do for you, but God says you're
[1:59:57] healed. Whose report will you believe?
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; People put so much faith in a doctor. I
[2:00:03] worked for doctors 18 years in surgery.
[2:00:05] STOOD RIGHT BESIDE THEM. DID ALL KINDS
[2:00:07] OF THOUSANDS of operations. Need your
[2:00:08] gallbladder out? See me downstairs.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, doctors can be
[2:00:17] wrong.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Doctors bury their mistakes.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE PUT SO MUCH AND I'VE GOT NOTHING.
[2:00:25] IF I'M S I WENT TO A DOCTOR THIS week
[2:00:27] cuz I pulled a muscle in my leg. I
[2:00:29] BELIEVE IN DOCTORS. BUT WHEN THE DOCTOR
[2:00:30] SAYS HE CAN'T HELP YOU, I KNOW SOMEBODY
[2:00:32] WHO CAN. AND THE THING ABOUT A DOCTOR'S
[2:00:35] REPORT, IT CAN BE 100% RIGHT OR it can
[2:00:37] be 100% WRONG.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S WORD IS ALWAYS RIGHT. AND HE
[2:00:41] SAID, "I AM THE LORD THY GOD WHO HEALTH
[2:00:43] THEE."
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; SO I'LL TAKE WHAT GOD SAID OVER WHAT THE
[2:00:46] DOCTOR SAID.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; The Christ that made you stop drinking,
[2:00:51] stop smoking, stop lying, stop stealing,
[2:00:54] that saved you from a life of
[2:00:55] drunkenness, from morale, and from sin.
[2:00:57] And if he can do that for you, can't he
[2:00:59] save you from TB? Can't he save you from
[2:01:02] cancer? Right. Amen.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; He's a Goliath. DON'T TAKE HIS BOAST.
[2:01:05] STAND IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS AND
[2:01:07] CHALLENGE HIM TO A SHOWDOWN.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Positionally in Christ. If every
[2:01:13] believer knew his position,
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; He'd have it.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Then don't you see what the devil wants
[2:01:19] to do is keep you from recognizing who
[2:01:22] you are. Keep you from realizing what
[2:01:24] your position. Well, I'm too young. I'm
[2:01:26] just a young person. It don't matter
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; if you're positionally placed in Christ.
[2:01:31] believe that.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. If every believer knew his
[2:01:40] position, he'd have it. God's great
[2:01:42] spirit is here AND THE HOLY GHOST IS
[2:01:44] READY TO FALL ON ANYBODY.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; That will believe it.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Then you can have it. GOD HAS PROMISED
[2:01:52] IT. GOD WILL DO IT. WE'RE IN CHRIST.
[2:01:55] That's right.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; My people, my mama's people were
[2:01:59] Melunian. Anybody know what a Melundian
[2:02:00] is? Never heard of it. Melundians is a
[2:02:02] tri-racial people. Black, white, and
[2:02:04] Indian. That's where my mama's people
[2:02:06] were. I can go to any continent on earth
[2:02:08] and be at home.
[2:02:11] And so there's a group called
[2:02:12] Melundians. And so they having a big
[2:02:14] reunion up in Chillhawi, Virginia. And
[2:02:16] me and my brother went up there. Anybody
[2:02:18] ever remember Alfred? You remember
[2:02:20] Alfred Hall, don't you? Brother David.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Alfred Hall. Probably one of the
[2:02:23] darkest white men I've ever seen. And so
[2:02:25] me and my brother was walking up there
[2:02:26] in Chill how where the Melenian reunion
[2:02:28] was and we was talking. I said, "I tell
[2:02:30] you right now, if anybody's here today,
[2:02:32] it'll be Alfred Hall." And we turned the
[2:02:34] corner and guess who I saw? I said, "I
[2:02:37] knew you'd be here." He started
[2:02:38] laughing. He had a book under his arm
[2:02:40] and the guy Brent Kennedy wrote this
[2:02:42] book called Melundon, the resurrecting
[2:02:43] of a proud people. And he's there
[2:02:45] signing autographs. And so, Brother Hall
[2:02:47] had got the autograph of that book and
[2:02:48] he's walking down through there with his
[2:02:50] under his arm. I said, "I knew you'd be
[2:02:51] here." He started laughing. He said,
[2:02:52] "THE MAN THAT WROTE THE BOOK SAID I'm
[2:02:54] one of them."
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want the devil TO KNOW TODAY. THE
[2:03:01] MAN THAT WROTE THE BOOK SAID, "I'M ONE
[2:03:02] OF THEM. I'M CHOSEN. I'M ELECTED. I'M
[2:03:04] POSITIONALLY PRAY IN THE BODY OF
[2:03:06] CHRIST." AMEN. THAT'S WHO I AM. THAT'S
[2:03:08] WHAT I COME FROM. THAT'S MY PURPOSE FOR
[2:03:10] BEING BORN.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; I wasn't BORN TO BE A DRUNK. I WASN'T
[2:03:13] BORN TO BE A LIAR. I WAS BORN TO BE A
[2:03:15] SON OF GOD.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I didn't come up and
[2:03:18] mix up a doctrine, but to straighten one
[2:03:19] out, to get away from this fear and
[2:03:20] scare that you don't know WHO YOU YOU'RE
[2:03:22] NOT GOING TO BE, BUT YOU ARE NOW SONS
[2:03:24] AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. YOU ALWAYS WERE
[2:03:26] sons and daughters of God.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Election, calling, anointing,
[2:03:31] place, and he elected you, called you,
[2:03:32] he elected you, called you, then he
[2:03:34] anointed you with the Holy Spirit, and
[2:03:35] he's placed you in the body of Christ.
[2:03:37] Each one of these Davids, who is the
[2:03:39] David of today?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; It's you.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; You need to be like a little boy looking
[2:03:46] in the mirror say, "Why, mama?
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; That's me."
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; It's me. David stood up there and faced
[2:03:52] that giant knowing he was anointed by a
[2:03:54] prophet.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; God's word. God is in his word. God
[2:04:00] confirms his word. God keeps his word.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; God had come to him by a prophet and
[2:04:04] anointed him and told him what he was
[2:04:06] GOING TO BE. SO DAVID WAS SATISFIED.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; SAINTS, a prophet has stood IN THIS
[2:04:11] GENERATION AND HAS PROPHESIED OVER YOU.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; The word of God was on him. How can I
[2:04:19] die by John and reign as a king?
[2:04:22] How could he? It's impossible. YOU CAN'T
[2:04:24] DO BOTH. SO, I'LL TAKE WHAT GOD SAID.
[2:04:26] AMEN.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. David knew what he's talking
[2:04:30] about. That's the reason he wasn't
[2:04:32] afraid of Goliath.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the rock that David had in the
[2:04:35] sling that killed Goliath. It wasn't
[2:04:38] that sling that he had in his hand that
[2:04:39] killed Goliath. It wasn't that stone
[2:04:41] that he had IN HIS POCKET. THAT WASN'T
[2:04:43] WHAT DONE IT. WHAT DONE IT? IT WAS HIS
[2:04:45] HIDDEN POWER,
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT blessing of God when David
[2:04:49] let loose of what HE HAD. GOD TOOK IT
[2:04:51] AND BLESSED IT
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; WITH A hidden power. So it wasn't David,
[2:04:55] it wasn't the stone, it wasn't the
[2:04:56] slingshot, IT WAS THE BLESSING THAT WAS
[2:04:58] ON HIM.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE? WE'RE THE
[2:05:01] SMALLEST GROUP IN THE WORLD. BUT WHAT
[2:05:03] MAKES US WHAT WE ARE?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT HIDDEN BLESSING THAT GOD HAS
[2:05:08] PLACED UPON US. HE HAS PROPHESIED OVER
[2:05:10] US. DON'T YOU SEE? GOD'S DONE SAW YOU IN
[2:05:12] A RAPTURE.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:17] That's right.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; David of today, as we're coming to a
[2:05:22] close, you have a hidden power, the
[2:05:24] anointing of the Holy Ghost. As David
[2:05:27] was anointed to meet his Giant, so are
[2:05:29] we anointed to meet ours.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Every man and woman this afternoon that
[2:05:35] wants to go on with God, don't pay any
[2:05:36] attention to what the world says.
[2:05:37] Whether we can or whether WE CAN'T, GOD
[2:05:39] PROMISED IT.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; THAT settles it. God said so. Amen.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; And when God says so, that settles it
[2:05:46] forever.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That settles it forever.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Do you love him, friends?
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Do you see who we are in this hour?
[2:05:54] We're not an organization. We are not a
[2:05:55] denomination. We are the bride of Jesus
[2:05:58] Christ chosen for such a time as this to
[2:06:01] meet the challenge of this hour. The
[2:06:03] giants that are raising their hand.
[2:06:04] Those who used to walk among us now
[2:06:06] criticize us and put trash on the
[2:06:08] internet about us. But it don't phase me
[2:06:11] one bit cuz I know who I am. I know
[2:06:13] where I come from. I know what the man
[2:06:15] who wrote the book said I was.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; And I figured the man that wrote the
[2:06:21] book knew what he was talking about.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; So my faith is not my ability.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; It's not my education, but is in the God
[2:06:30] who found me in Jonesburg, Tennessee.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for God.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; He came looking for me. You weren't
[2:06:36] looking for God. Well, I sought God. Bur
[2:06:38] said you never sought God. It was always
[2:06:40] God seeking you.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Don't you see that hunger for you, God?
[2:06:44] That hunger, that desire that you had
[2:06:46] for God.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; That was God looking for you.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Who come looking for the first lost son?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't send an angel. He didn't send
[2:06:57] a prophet. God came himself.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; Who found the FIRST LOST SON? GOD DID.
[2:07:02] THEN WHO FINDS EVERY LOST SON?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; God does.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; David for today. Amen.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Recognize who you are when you walk out
[2:07:11] that door. Recognize with this
[2:07:13] revelation, I am a son and daughter of
[2:07:15] God, and no giant can stand before me.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Do you love him today?
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe him today?
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, I trust I've not preached too long.
[2:07:26] I know you're tired. You've been here a
[2:07:27] long time, but let's just bow our heads.
[2:07:30] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[2:07:33] Hallelujah. Just something maybe to
[2:07:35] encourage your faith just a little bit.
[2:07:37] Certainly no kind of a preacher, but oh
[2:07:40] hallelujah. I just know in whom I've
[2:07:42] believed.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:46] Why would I worry when giants come
[2:07:49] calling my name?
[2:07:54] My God is so much bigger. Troubles I
[2:07:58] face.
[2:08:02] And why would I hunger for power or
[2:08:05] riches or fame? Cuz
[2:08:10] my God is so much better than all of
[2:08:13] these things.
[2:08:16] So I won't be shenen.
[2:08:20] I won't be moved.
[2:08:24] My God is faithful.
[2:08:27] His promise is true.
[2:08:31] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:08:35] Tell him it's time to move.
[2:08:39] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:08:44] greater than you.
[2:08:48] My enemies scatter cuz they know the
[2:08:52] battle is done.
[2:08:58] My God is stronger. The victories
[2:09:01] already won.
[2:09:06] Yes, he died for my ransom and rose up
[2:09:09] on the third day.
[2:09:14] Cause my God is greater than death. Hell
[2:09:18] and the grave.
[2:09:22] So I won't be shed.
[2:09:27] I won't be moved.
[2:09:32] My God is faithful.
[2:09:36] His promise is true.
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; So I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:09:44] Tell him it's time to move.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:09:54] greater than you.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; Just play it softly now, brothers.
[2:09:59] Whoever heads bowed.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know it's just a simple message.
[2:10:04] But you see, God will hide and reveal
[2:10:06] himself in simplicity.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; And it does no good to talk about the
[2:10:11] message. It does no good to talk about
[2:10:13] the Holy Ghost. The hours come that we
[2:10:15] must apply the Holy Ghost. For when I
[2:10:18] see the blood, I will pass over you. And
[2:10:20] God has placed the blood shill upon
[2:10:22] every true born again believer.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; You can stand here with this confidence
[2:10:26] that your God will not fail you. We're
[2:10:29] living in such a troublesome time. Wars
[2:10:31] and rumors of wars, pestilence,
[2:10:33] earthquakes, and diverse places. Just
[2:10:35] had one yesterday. I believe it was out
[2:10:36] in Oregon off the coast. 6.0 earthquake.
[2:10:39] She's shaking loose. Everything's
[2:10:41] pointing. Oh my. But God said in this
[2:10:44] hour when you see these things begin to
[2:10:46] come to pass, he didn't say give up,
[2:10:48] walk away, but he said lift up your
[2:10:50] head. Your redemption draweth nigh. And
[2:10:53] as we see the world coming into their
[2:10:54] position, coming into their anointing
[2:10:56] for destruction. So is there another
[2:10:58] group of people who's coming under a
[2:10:59] different anointing? It's an anointing
[2:11:01] for deliverance.
[2:11:03] Oh my. Or are you under the blood,
[2:11:06] friend? Mom, dad, brother, sister. It's
[2:11:09] not how long you've been in the message.
[2:11:11] We've seen people in this message for
[2:11:13] years, preached it, now they've turned
[2:11:15] and walked away from it. It's not enough
[2:11:17] to say you're in it, but is it in you
[2:11:20] today? You see, God God don't want just
[2:11:23] to be above us. He don't want to just be
[2:11:25] with us, but he wants to be in us.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Well, can we yield oursel to him today?
[2:11:31] Can each of us and each believer, every
[2:11:33] preacher, brother, sister, mama, daddy,
[2:11:36] boy, girl, young people? You say,
[2:11:38] "Brother, I I realize this message is
[2:11:40] maybe more towards the young people, but
[2:11:42] we're all young at heart.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; But each of us, are we willing to
[2:11:47] surrender? Are we willing to come into
[2:11:50] our position? Just be what God made me
[2:11:52] to be. That's all he wants me to be. He
[2:11:54] made the oak tree because he wanted an
[2:11:56] oak tree. He made the maple tree cuz he
[2:11:58] wanted a maple tree. And he made you
[2:12:00] because he wanted you that way before he
[2:12:02] was ever born, before the foundation of
[2:12:04] the world. He knew the color of your
[2:12:05] skin, the color of your eyes, the color
[2:12:06] of your hair. Oh my. He even knew your
[2:12:09] name.
[2:12:11] Lord, do you love him today? And if
[2:12:13] you're here, friends, and maybe you let
[2:12:16] the devil beat you down. Maybe you're
[2:12:18] like Saul in his army that you're
[2:12:20] dismayed.
[2:12:22] But I say, little David. Oh, little
[2:12:24] David, realize who you are today.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to meet the challenge.
[2:12:29] Don't be afraid to meet that devil and
[2:12:30] back him off your property, trying to
[2:12:32] take your children, trying to take your
[2:12:33] family. Stand your ground today.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Defy,
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; oh my the lies of Satan.
[2:12:41] If you're here today and you have that
[2:12:42] need, whatever the need would be, you
[2:12:45] said, "Brother D, I realize what you're
[2:12:46] saying. I am a David. He has called me
[2:12:48] for this. I will not back down. Oh, I
[2:12:52] will take my confession." What is a
[2:12:54] stone? It's a confession. I'll take my
[2:12:56] confession today and I'll bring it to
[2:12:58] the eye of the enemy.
[2:13:01] Oh my. Don't you see, brother, sister,
[2:13:03] when David let go of that stone, where
[2:13:05] did it hit? The only place that wasn't
[2:13:07] covered, right between the eyes.
[2:13:10] Oh my. God knows how to hit the mark.
[2:13:13] Don't be afraid to let the sling go.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; If you're here today and you have that
[2:13:17] need, I wonder if you would just slip up
[2:13:18] to your feet and say, "God, I have a
[2:13:20] need today." Maybe it's it's sickness. I
[2:13:22] don't know, friend. Maybe you're weary.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Maybe you feel like just quitting. You
[2:13:25] know, you're coming into a new year and
[2:13:26] seem like everything's going wrong. But
[2:13:29] if you're here and you have a need, I
[2:13:30] just wonder if you stay if you just want
[2:13:32] to get closer to God in this 26. This
[2:13:35] fellowship is so good for the churches
[2:13:37] to come together. We're a body of
[2:13:38] believers. We need one another.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; You know, Toronto
[2:13:48] 25 years they tried to catch him and
[2:13:50] they couldn't. He finally just
[2:13:51] surrendered and the White Mountain
[2:13:53] Apaches that tracked him down. They put
[2:13:56] him on the same train with Dono shipped
[2:13:58] him down to Florida. And while they was
[2:14:01] on that train, one of Dono's warriors
[2:14:10] said it was wrong to trust the white
[2:14:12] man. Everything he said to us was a lie.
[2:14:16] And one of Geronom's warriors said to
[2:14:18] the to the Apaches that tracked them
[2:14:20] down, he said, "I hate you." AS LONG AS
[2:14:23] THERE'S BREATH IN MY BODY, I'll hate
[2:14:25] you. Why didn't you leave us alone? This
[2:14:27] was our land. WE WERE SERVING our God.
[2:14:30] He gave US THIS LAND. WHY DID YOU TRACK
[2:14:33] us down like that? I'll hate you as long
[2:14:35] as there's breath in my body. And they
[2:14:37] said, Geronimus spoke up and said, do
[2:14:39] not hate him. There's too few of us left
[2:14:42] to hate one another.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, little bride. We may not go to the
[2:14:46] same church, but we're in the same body.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; We need one another. I need you. You
[2:14:51] need me. We need each other. Here's what
[2:14:54] I want us to do.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Maybe that person standing beside you
[2:14:57] really has a need today. But here's what
[2:14:59] I want us to do. Just reach over and lay
[2:15:01] handsh on the person beside you. brother
[2:15:03] to brother, sister, sister, husband,
[2:15:04] family, whatever it would be. And I want
[2:15:07] us to pray.
[2:15:09] Oh my, you're God-given right. The man
[2:15:13] that wrote the book said, "The
[2:15:14] effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous
[2:15:16] man avaleth much." Recognize who you are
[2:15:19] today. Exercise your God-given right.
[2:15:22] Pray for that brother. Pray for that
[2:15:24] sister. Oh, that they'll be drawn closer
[2:15:26] to God. That they'll be healed. That
[2:15:27] their families will be saved. Whatever's
[2:15:29] in their heart, how you feel, just lay
[2:15:31] pray for them this morning. Will you do
[2:15:33] it?
[2:15:34] Amen. Almighty God, we stand before you
[2:15:38] today in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh
[2:15:41] God, we come, Father, knowing that
[2:15:44] there's no greater name than the name of
[2:15:45] Jesus. And we speak that name today over
[2:15:48] our brother, over our sister. And God, I
[2:15:50] don't know what they have need of, but
[2:15:52] thou knowest all things today, Lord. And
[2:15:54] God, if they're here, if they're sick,
[2:15:56] if they're weary, if they're having
[2:15:57] marital trouble, financial trouble,
[2:16:00] whatever the need would be today, if
[2:16:01] they need MORE OF YOU, GOD, I PRAY BY
[2:16:04] THAT ANOINTING THAT raised my Lord from
[2:16:06] the grave. May that anointing fall among
[2:16:08] us right now, oh God. And may you move
[2:16:11] from one to the other to the other. It's
[2:16:12] not based on a sensation. IT'S NOT BASED
[2:16:15] on a goosebump. It's based upon
[2:16:17] believing your word. And today we
[2:16:19] believe, oh God, you're the same
[2:16:20] yesterday, today, and forever. Move up
[2:16:23] on my brother. Move up on my sister.
[2:16:25] SATAN, I ADJURE THEE BY GOD. YOU ARE
[2:16:28] DEFEATED. YOU'RE NOTHING BUT a bluff. I
[2:16:30] rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:16:33] LEAVE MY BROTHER. LEAVE MY SISTER for
[2:16:35] the glory of God today. The son of God
[2:16:38] has made us free. And who the son hath
[2:16:40] made free is free indeed. I am free to
[2:16:44] worship my God in spirit and in truth. I
[2:16:47] AM FREE TO STAND UPON MY GODGIVEN RIGHT.
[2:16:50] The man that wrote the book said so. The
[2:16:53] man that wrote the book said, "I'm an
[2:16:54] overcomer." The man that wrote the book
[2:16:56] said, "I'm predestinated." The man that
[2:16:58] wrote the book said, "I'm anointed. I'm
[2:16:59] chosen. I'm called. I'm elected. I'm
[2:17:02] placed for such a time as this."
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; And I receive it today in the name of
[2:17:07] Jesus Christ. For the glory of God. For
[2:17:11] the glory of God. In Jesus name. Say
[2:17:14] something. Hallelujah.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, I won't be shamed.
[2:17:22] I won't be moved.
[2:17:27] My God is faithful.
[2:17:31] His promise is true.
[2:17:35] So I'll speak to the mountain
[2:17:40] telling it's time to move.
[2:17:45] Because my God is bigger, better,
[2:17:49] stronger, greater than you.
[2:17:54] Listen, when my daughter was hurt real
[2:17:56] bad, two of my family was killed. I went
[2:18:00] down to the chapel at the hospital and I
[2:18:02] laid in the floor of that hospital
[2:18:04] chapel and I cried out to God. I didn't
[2:18:07] care who heard me. I didn't care who saw
[2:18:09] me. My baby was dying. And I said,
[2:18:12] "Lord," I said, "If you was here like
[2:18:15] you were 2,000 years ago." I said, "All
[2:18:18] I have to do is touch the hymn of your
[2:18:19] garment and I could go upstairs and get
[2:18:22] my baby and take her home." I said, "But
[2:18:25] Lord, you're not here like that today in
[2:18:26] that body that you were 2,000 years
[2:18:28] ago." And God is my witness. While I was
[2:18:30] laying on the floor, something spoke to
[2:18:32] my heart and said, "BUT MY BRIDE IS
[2:18:34] HERE."
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; If you touch her, you've touched me.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. I jumped up from that floor
[2:18:39] because I realized all I had to do was
[2:18:41] get this brother, this brother, this
[2:18:43] brother, this sister to COME AND LAY
[2:18:44] HANDS UPON MY DAUGHTER. IT WAS JUST THE
[2:18:46] SAME AS JESUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE HE
[2:18:48] FAILED TODAY.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; Do you realize who you are? Do you
[2:18:55] realize who you are?
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of the most
[2:18:59] high God.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. Let's sing it
[2:19:02] again as we turn the service over.
[2:19:04] Hallelujah. Oh, why would I worry when
[2:19:08] giants come calling in my name?
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; My God is so much bigger. Troules I
[2:19:25] would hunger for power or riches or
[2:19:29] fame.
[2:19:32] Oh my God is so much better in all of
[2:19:37] these things.
[2:19:41] So I won't be shen.
[2:19:46] I won't be moved.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; I trust it was okay.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; My God is faithful.
[2:19:55] His promise is true.
[2:19:59] the line out to the mountain.
[2:20:04] It's time to move
[2:20:08] cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:20:14] greater than you. Let's sing it one more
[2:20:16] time.
[2:20:18] So I won't be shaking.
[2:20:23] I won't be moved.
[2:20:27] My God is faithful.
[2:20:32] His promise is true.
[2:20:36] So I'll speak to the mountains.
[2:20:41] His kind.
[2:20:46] My God is bigger, better, stronger, and
[2:20:51] greater than.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; One more time. Take sing it to him.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; I won't be shamed.
[2:21:00] I won't be moved.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; You're saying that to the Lord.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; He's hearing what you're confessing.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; His promise is true.
[2:21:13] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:21:18] It's time to move.
[2:21:23] My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:21:27] greater than you.
[2:21:31] Yes, he is. Amen. God bless you. Enjoy
[2:21:34] that. Let's give our brother a hand.
[2:21:41] You know, the devil can't get anything
[2:21:43] over on God cuz God the he's the
[2:21:46] originator and Satan's the impostor.
[2:21:48] Amen.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Satan just didn't know, brother Tony,
[2:21:51] when he anointed that big old giant to
[2:21:54] walk down into that field
[2:21:59] and he created that rock before the
[2:22:00] foundation of the world.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; And that rock was predestinated
[2:22:06] during the flood. God just took his
[2:22:08] finger and he draw a a little line and
[2:22:11] here comes the water.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And over all the years, all that
[2:22:15] water flowed over those rocks for one
[2:22:18] purpose.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Goliath didn't know he was looking at
[2:22:23] what it was fixing to destroy him. And
[2:22:25] God had already prepared it. He prepared
[2:22:28] the smoothest stone. Brother David, five
[2:22:30] of them. Left them right there after the
[2:22:33] flood. They stayed there forever how
[2:22:35] long it was. And they stayed there until
[2:22:36] David picked them up. And when he picked
[2:22:39] him up,
[2:22:41] he had fulfilled God's plan that he saw
[2:22:44] before even the foundation of the world.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; So that rock was a mountain at one time.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; So when the flood happened, it just tore
[2:22:54] pieces of that rock off and laid her
[2:22:55] down in a valley.
[2:22:58] Brother Martin laid him right in that
[2:22:59] valley, stopped five stones right where
[2:23:02] David walked across. He picked up the
[2:23:04] five stones God saw before the
[2:23:06] foundation of the world that was going
[2:23:08] to do Goliath in. Goliath just didn't
[2:23:11] know he was defeated before he was even
[2:23:12] born.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Satan is defeated before he was even
[2:23:17] made.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; He can't do anything but fail.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; There's nothing he can do but fail.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Boy, what a mighty God we serve.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. And to know that David
[2:23:32] standing there and he he looked at that
[2:23:34] giant
[2:23:36] got it. He looked at that giant
[2:23:39] and he knew that a prophet had anointed
[2:23:41] him
[2:23:43] several years before that.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; And you know what he done? He believed
[2:23:48] his prophet. That sound familiar?
[2:23:51] He believed what his prophet said about
[2:23:55] him. You will be king. Now, the only way
[2:23:58] to be a king in Israel, you have to have
[2:24:00] a crown and a throne.
[2:24:05] A crown and a throne.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; David didn't have that yet.
[2:24:11] He was still in his early journey.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; So, whatever your Goliath is,
[2:24:17] you must see yourself sitting on the
[2:24:19] throne. Hello, somebody. Revelations 5
[2:24:21] said, "We priests and kings."
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Revelation's over there in
[2:24:26] about 20 says there's thrones
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; and we're sitting on those thrones. Why?
[2:24:31] Because we've defeated the Goliath in
[2:24:34] our life.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; And that's what David was looking at. He
[2:24:37] was looking He was looking right
[2:24:38] straight through Goliath and looking at
[2:24:40] at at Jerusalem where that throne was
[2:24:44] and he was going to sit on that throne.
[2:24:47] You got to see that. Remember brother
[2:24:48] Ram told us he said he said Abraham
[2:24:52] saw the baby before it was born.
[2:24:56] Remember he said he went ahead and
[2:24:57] bought the birdies and the booty eyes
[2:24:59] and he brought everything. He got
[2:25:00] everything ready before there was even
[2:25:02] one one feeling he was making ready. So
[2:25:06] today let's make ready this year. Let's
[2:25:08] make ready.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; That this year we're going to see
[2:25:12] something we've never seen before.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; God's going to work more powerful than
[2:25:16] he's ever worked before. But he's going
[2:25:18] to work through me and you. But we've
[2:25:19] got to believe that we are that David
[2:25:21] that has already been anointed
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; to be priests and kings. If you believe
[2:25:27] what your prophet said.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; That God's in his people.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; And if God's in his people, you've
[2:25:36] already won.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; I like that song. We've already won.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; It's already done. We just got to go
[2:25:41] through it. We got to go through the
[2:25:42] game, but we've already won.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; We appreciate all of you coming. God
[2:25:46] bless you. We love you with the love of
[2:25:47] the Lord. Please stay and eat with us.
[2:25:48] We got plenty of food downstairs. If you
[2:25:50] don't have anywhere to go tomorrow,
[2:25:51] Brother Daryl will be here in the
[2:25:53] morning at starting at 10:00 with the
[2:25:56] sorry with the Sunday school class at
[2:25:58] 10:00 and then uh just pray for us all.
[2:26:02] Pray for brother Daryl tomorrow as he
[2:26:03] goes back home. It's supposed to be
[2:26:04] snowing up there a little bit. So So
[2:26:06] just pray for them him as he travels. It
[2:26:09] happened the last time he was here. He
[2:26:11] was here last year at this time. Same
[2:26:12] thing happened. It was 3 in of snow when
[2:26:14] he got home. So, let's just pray that
[2:26:15] the Lord will keep the roads open for
[2:26:17] him. But I want him to be back tomorrow
[2:26:19] so he can give us some more of that.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; I want some more of them stones.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; Stones revelation, right? I want some
[2:26:25] more of those stones.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; David, show up tomorrow. Let's get some
[2:26:29] stones and let's defeat any giant that
[2:26:32] you have in your life.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; He'll do it for you.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord. Let's bless the
[2:26:37] food and and and thank you all for
[2:26:40] coming. If I missed anybody, I'm sorry.
[2:26:42] Uh, I think everybody's been here
[2:26:43] before. So, God bless you. Let's bow our
[2:26:47] heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord, what
[2:26:49] a message. What a message we have, Lord,
[2:26:52] that as our brother said before the even
[2:26:55] before the foundation of the world, this
[2:26:57] plan and purpose was in your mind.
[2:27:00] And the prophet of God told us that you
[2:27:01] saw something that you wanted to
[2:27:03] achieve. So, you made a plan and you
[2:27:06] made a purpose. And we know you can't
[2:27:08] change. Lord, we just got to realize
[2:27:10] we're a part of that plan and put the
[2:27:13] pieces together, Lord, down here on this
[2:27:15] earth where we are. You saw us come to a
[2:27:18] place, Lord, to where Satan can't have
[2:27:21] any hold on us. For, Father, we're
[2:27:22] heading to that. We must listen to the
[2:27:25] word of God. The prophet said, he said
[2:27:27] that that our glorified bodies being
[2:27:30] built around our born again experience
[2:27:31] that as we become the word as we eat the
[2:27:33] word. So, Lord, there's nothing else for
[2:27:35] us to eat except the word of God. But
[2:27:38] Father, we got natural food downstairs
[2:27:40] that we have to eat because we're in
[2:27:41] these old human bodies and we have to
[2:27:43] have fuel. And Father, I pray that you'd
[2:27:45] sanctify it, Lord, and it nourish our
[2:27:46] bodies. Be with the ones, Lord, that
[2:27:48] have to travel afterwards today. Father,
[2:27:50] I pray that you'd be with each one,
[2:27:51] Lord, that has a need. I believe there
[2:27:53] was a lot of needs met tonight, Lord.
[2:27:55] And I believe that we're continuing to
[2:27:58] believe that you are the great
[2:28:00] physician, the great Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:28:05] We ask these things in your precious
[2:28:06] name. Lord, go with us now in Jesus
[2:28:09] name. Amen. God bless you. You're
[2:28:11] dismissed.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. We've got a uh we've got our
[2:28:17] Valentine's banquet coming up uh
