TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hart doesn't have you with us hope you have a blessed time here and I know we're rough we're gonna have a blessed time because we opened the Word of God so let's get started in Revelation chapter 1 I told you to read Melanson chapter 1 what we're gonna do is is we're gonna go through and read the whole first chapter and then come back in and then comment back through that okay that way we'll read it and get the gist of all of it and we'll have some week everybody gonna as people come in you're gonna have to suck it up buttercup let people sit beside this because I wasn't your size not here these making in Libya c-level team today but just in case anybody else comes in revelations chapter 1 now we're going to study but there it would be good for you to read the church age book but like I said before try to read the individual sermon alright because the individual sermons will help you as we go through each verse excuse me verse by verse reason being the church age book if you didn't know this the church age book is a compilation or a compiling of all those sermons and then they took off the tape brotherly veil and composed it how many people don't like the church thinking book cause I think Lee veil had something to do with it what he did but he put it together and listen brother Branham read it before he passed away looking after the seal for open he read the book and released it so that was in 1960 in the latter part of 63 64 he released it and approved it so as far as I'm concerned it's the word guy it's what the prophets said and many people say it's leave out the book many people say it's a woman's book cousin woman topped it anyway I say yeah well they say they say that she was confident she manipulated it but no if we believe brother Brown would be a prophet of word prophet and that word prophet read that book if the Holy Ghost didn't interpret it that's correct then he would have changed it would have been changed right I saw notes one time with brother Branham actually it was brother rounds handwriting and he would write like during the writing of it that's right like letters to female right well what he done was he ranted and I'm sure he made additions and corrections and then they printed the book but he read the book as it was printed so I believe it's I believe it's something that's on it to me it's got all the major doctrines in it he's got all the things in it friend you convert I would not let him you convert have a seal book right until about 10 years after they I think become well not now because the time we're living in the 11th hour worker may get a little more but but the church age book is more stage right with the with the doctrines of the of the Bible but those individual sermons he preached each individual sermon out of the Bible right so that's why I told you to read the individual books if you want to if not we're gonna read it and we read here so the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave it to him now watch excuse me the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him this is not three people here two people right to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass I'm telling you what I'm gonna do and I'll tell you here before when I get finished with revival I'm kind of thinking on a sermon called a transfer of power okay a transfer of power so just keep that kind of right around in your head so that's what I've been thinking about because there is a transfer of power alright because look the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave them him so God gave something the Jesus Christ the position an extra person but a position that God with what condescending to Jesus Christ and then Jesus Christ Christ condescending to a messenger and let me give you a little bit background about this John it's called the Revelator because he wrote the book of Revelation and he also wrote first thing third giant and he also wrote the book of done all right so John was a really young guy he was the only apostle to die of natural causes he was like 90 something years old when he died he actually passed her some of the churches that Paul had set up even after Paul had had passed off ghosts Paul passed off in like 1866 and I think this was in 96 or something that John went to the Isle of Patmos but John was commissioned and we'll read it here now to write the things he saw not to interpret but the rites of things he saw and send it to the churches so John was the young boy that was under under Jesus Jesus goes off the same Paul goes off the same and John is commissioned there actually John was trying to put some of the Gospels together and the Romans or whoever it was the hierarchy didn't want him to do it so they hold him in oil for a long period of time he just took a good bath and made his skin feel good but it was boiling oil and God preserved him changed him to preserve him to bring us to a place to where he was going to write this because remember what Jesus said back when they were doing the load doing the fishes on the side of the bank after the resurrection jesus said what is it today if somebody sees the kingdom coming well then remember the Bible says people say anyone out that who he was talking to John that somebody was going to live until Christ came back well that's not morning what John and revelation saw becoming apart he saw the hold it to me this rebel Book of Revelations is the whole kingdom Jew Gentile foolish virgin Antichrist everything is in this that's my brother always calls if the bride's book because it is it's for the ride to the bride and written by the bride John was part of the bride of that age John was a part of the bride for the first verse age down here there back out there so John was commissioned so they couldn't kill him by balling him so they said well we just gonna put you in the worst place in the world we're gonna put you on the island of Patmos where there's nothing but rocks and scorpions and snakes and they just figured if we leave John let him roam around a little bit out there the snake almighty Mara scorpion bite him and kill him and just get rid of him he'll just die but he didn't he came back because what did God tell him to take these things and bring it back to the churches I want you to get something there God predestinated somebody to do this join took a hold of the revelation that he wasn't gonna die until he saw all that stay plays man and he's in the middle of Patmos he's in a horrible place and then when God tell him says look take these back to the church so he knows he's gonna get off the island what am I saying you look at the promises in the Bible about you you can't die unless these promises are fulfilled amen so yeah that's when we got a look at is then John literally Tom the whole bride our whole journey from from predestination to body change listen some have changed his body while he was in that oil his skin would have fell off his body so he took a body change while he was in the oil God give him a pat I mean a temporary body change why because he told him while he was here somebody's gonna live to write and see the kingdom yeah of course I believe Jesus knew it was John but he didn't he didn't just physically say that it was but I like what John writes in in in the book of John the one that's closest to Jesus one that laid on his breast the young one that did you thought myself he just didn't want to say Jesus loved me more than the rest of me just didn't want to say that he it was real real humble but look what John did though John spent his whole entire life all the other 11 apostles died and martyrdom a lot of them didn't make it past four or five years after Jesus before me I mean Jesus left this thing yeah : were dispersed James was killed by Emperor additional Windom Indian got killed and this man all got him except for remember Peter was crucified upside down but John was commissioned to see the coming aboard no not to see the physical coming but he did see in physical horn good what let's read this revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass zeikos when John writes this they're already in the first church age you get some history behind it they're already in the first church age goes first Church ages 1853 to 170 and this is about 90 something if you got a Scofield Bible weekend it'll tell you and you can copy the page what year that that was written but they've got one Oh John you got it anybody got Scofield Bible what is anything 90 see yes okay so see we're right in the middle of this church age already when he gets this to send to the churches and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John now I'm gonna debunk a myth right now that was not brother Branham brother round did not appear to nobody in the whole book of Revelation he was spoken of as being the last he's the last star he's one of these seven stars okay no doubt but he's not the person William Branham because that would mean pre-existence or so that means it brother brown would have to be full grown be up the apogee somewhere no that's not right now people teach it in the message I want to quote from that I don't wanted night I've got everything that brother Brown says about soul what were you before you were born he said nothing right now in the mind of God absolutely but you were nothing before you were born you were in the mind of God and you develop down here on the earth so a brother round goes to John he goes back 2,000 years before he was born and appears to John I got a problem with that number two problem I have with it is if brother Branham was one who told John all this my brother drowned the man have to get the sales angel by and all the other sermons from the angel that met brother Branham okay so let's get it straight this was prophesied this was an angel that came to John to give him the message now remember to that revelation of Jesus Christ God gave to Jesus and Jesus gave it to John so there's no in-between there it was Christ talking and appearing to John because it's the first thing that happens right here John hears voice turns around and says here's the trumpet turns around he sees the man then he won't live for three and a half years okay so he knows that that guy he actually heard the voice in knew the voice but hearing a trumpet he turns and sees no but now watch who he sees he sees Christ and bride form for watch all right let's go through and read and he sent signified it by his angel to his servant John I just want you to get that out of your mind there's no William Brown there's no better see I make him a respecter Park daughter respecter of person that would make him to wear run around was born perfect he was born the angel romance when he was born States and he had children by sex I'm just gonna be plain so he wasn't not okay there's no way he can be gone then just make a quick comment on the shirts Peugeot hitting's if if if John types the bride and I'm and we are the Bride of Christ and if you see yourself in the word the way you should the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto you that's right that's right see so word like brotherly sinner where the bride today we're reading about what God told us that's true okay through a prophet but he told it to us the correct form because see there's a lot of people preaching this today in the Book of Revelations number one - can't understand what's going on hold the symbols we had to have a prophet and I'm gonna read it this afternoon we had to have a prophet come so we can even have a revival because it was so scattered God cannot quick and word that's not seed work it's not real work because who quickens non seed not Christ came quick and dicey so that's what he's saying the jerkbait book and it's very common to know that in non seat there's nothing to quicken so whatever seed now it's Satan does so safe remember he was people do this but it's what tires and it's going to come up got to live them let them alone let them grow up and that's what's happening now they were touring you see the week doing their job when you see the tears doing their job so this is God talking to us but it had that when he he had to bring a conduit called William Brown a conduit to straighten out all the white he said loose ends and the Book of Revelations is the worst misunderstood book all the samples and everything man's got all these different things but he took a prophet to come and lay him right down and say hey this is it who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw so now what John gonna do John's gonna set and he's going to see a vision okay he's gonna see a vision of what's going on blessed is he that readeth we're blessed today because we're reading it blessing us either read us and that means read this not read one time and they that hear the words of this prophecy because a lot of this remember is going to be prophecy because it's in the future that's why the Book of Revelations is called the apocalypse which is the end all right in the end time blessed is he that readeth they to hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein how blessed can we be for the time of the hand now look the time of the time was a hand in what for the revelation but now's the time for us to make that revelation real make it known I join to the seven churches which are in Asia and see there's nobody and that's what gets me is is Paul didn't walk through life going on the first terrific messenger know what reveal today was a probably sure it didn't thing I rainiest Martin Columbo Luke Wesley didn't come up saying when I'm the snake sturgeons messenger no he had a message but it took this man to take all this and put it together to where all the ages came right and all the messengers came right that's okay so it took they did take William Brown to do it but it was the Holy Ghost Ed had always a new seed when the Holy Ghost wrote that they knew the first he knew the first church a few just Paul the second was Irena he's everybody didn't call their name it was a mystery this whole book of revelations of the mystery but now it's revealed in the end time who these people he's talking to because the seven churches now are right here they've been told been revealed grace beyond you a piece from him which ends which was and which is to come from the seven spirits which are before the throne seven messengers are here revelation so there were seven spirits which are before his strong and through Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead in other words he was the one first one to resurrect to eternal life and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth and to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood John knew he needed a saviour washed us from our own sins in his own blood and have made us know what is the transfer of power and has made us and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful and true witness first because of the dead Prince of the kings of the earth period unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood , and have made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall steam and they also which pierced him there's the Jews and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him now that covers everybody he cometh in the cloud every eye shall see him now remember we seem the way the Bible presents him everybody else is gonna see him in different ways because remember he's not to the mossad to the Jews yet to them he is the Messiah but inside they not accepted him yet the foolish version will have to accept the eternal life at the white throne judgment and the foolish virgin and cup of water my name all that's gonna be but that's everybody I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the LORD which is which was and which is to come the Almighty you know I'll bring you a little key here in just a minute because he says I'm Alpha and Omega now alpha is what alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet right and Omega is the last like our Z hey you busy right from a disease so he's from alpha to Omega so what he's saying is is this not enough to discluded any of this but he had to start somewhere yes and he's gonna have to end somewhere and it's gonna be the same person yeah I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending said the Lord which is which was and which is to come the Almighty I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation so Johnson I'm no better than you are we're the same I've just been given a commission to write what I see by the Lord and the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day now that's not Sunday Saturday brother I've explained that I guess my mother read this I guess we'll explain isn't this one see if anybody go see your old man have you already forgot no I didn't I just thought we'd go ahead and go through this now all right here's red-letter joyce jesus talking saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what they'll see is right in a book now remember he was commissioned to write everything he saw except one thing revelations 10650 racked up Tigers and John the Lord says that's not for you that's gonna be for the antenna that's right they're the only ones gonna understand it dr. John could've wrote it down but no my one understood it okay right what does say it writing a book and sending to the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea all right so there's your seven but the prophet of God he had the bottle hem in line but they didn't have the date so the property God put some dates in there but remember each church ain't slaps over each other so there's not a definite cutoff point and a definite starting point this was just when they started accepting the message of that hour never I got that because you got to remember in Columbus time I think it was Colombo they died before his church they even started and that flipped people out but it shouldn't it's the message it's the people that catches the messengers message that's the importance if not it's just Paul preached to itself and he dies there is no Ephesus church right no Columbo brought his message and he passed on but people took same them brother around some message is nothing without the people here most powerful message since the message of Jesus Christ but it has to come to people not to take the point exclusively all right so now Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum stock tower Sardis Philadelphia lab see if this is God telling John that something's gonna I'm gonna send these messages to the church right and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned now look watch me Russ right here within the spirit Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet and the trumpet said so remember trumpets or not notes on a scale a trumpet in the Bible is a voice the shout divorce to Trump he showed us him from heaven with what no see you even in the you read commentaries of people and you read the comment and it's not laughable but it's all they know that this great horns gonna sound like a like a tornado alarm you know yo you seen the tornado drill you've heard me alarm you know they think that's what's gonna happen like dad and his brother long you know the brother walked off the tables gonna be this beast come walk up out of the you know come walking up out of them right out of the water and go two horns and seven eyes on these horn and that's going to be a mystery but we'll get into that that's why God sent probably that we can be so sure of what God said in this Bible and I turned to see the voice that spake with me now John literally was going to turn around and say hey Jesus how you doing that's singing them few years for maybe thirty to ninety six I've grown old and you're not but what did he say when he turned he saw seven golden candlesticks which represents what our lamp stands now you can go all the way back in the Old Testament with that seven golden candlesticks then brother Brown describe that as look one bulb they didn't fill each individual one of these up they filled them all up and there were wigs and as they filled it up the oil would come up out of one bow oh there's only one Holy Ghost that's right it was the Holy Ghost in every church aids not going foreign here and here and here no important in one bowl on the day of Pentecost reported in 120 volts then the 120 bowls poured into 3,000 bowls in the three thousand three million in here we are today cause boil is a type of the Holy Ghost okay so you have that oil and that's what happened in the Old Testaments thinking today third thing yesterday here's Moses and here's Aaron standing getting ready to go into the Holy of Holies and Moses has got to literally cover that man's whole body Bible says from the top of his head to the sole of his feet had to be oil see that's the top the Holy Ghost we see the Holy Ghost is to fill you not partially fill you but Phil you from him to toe now that's Dec to me that to me that types the body change because when Aaron went back into the Holy of Holies he was standing in front of God there was no intercessor there was no Jesus Christ it easy there was no human body intercessor called Jesus it was Jehovah which was Jesus Christ we know that but anyway when Aaron walked in there he could have face-to-face to the cloud or pillar fire whatever was and then here he was and he had no like me and you the Bible tells us now we could go where to go boldly before the throne of grace when we pull back the curtains already being pulled back on the holy of holies you now are all you now are all the holy of holies yeah everybody okay y'all okay back there okay okay all right I don't I don't want to get too elaborate let's just kind of stay with with this here but the semi gold kinda stays downstairs go to account stage there was a person standing in the midst of the seven candlesticks alright now there's a picture I think upstairs but he's strong right here for those beautiful see this is the church ages signified by them by the lamp stand or candlestick [Music] I said I'm throwing it out no laughing from the older people but now there's your oil going up through each taking out all the church age you got these little things of it'll lift and then what do you have you got a man cuz he heard a voice the voice was a man's voice right cuz there's no female voice our voice is his voice we are the female part of Christ but we don't have our own voice in that now that's what gets us in trouble that's what got the church agents in trouble they started letting a woman not a woman physical but a woman Church take over but you got a man standing here forgive me Lord I'm sorry but here's his arm this way here's his arm this way he's standing in the mix he's got his arms stretched out alpha only them he's everything every bit of part of him is here here here here here here and here it's all Jesus class in Bride form transfer of power Jesus goes back to the Father to stand on the right hand of power but then he transfers that power because what's this being turned I saw seven going ten stick in the midst of the seven candlesticks are lamps in one lock at the son of man who is the son of man Jesus Christ is deep son man if I got that all right that should be ingrained in our brain the son of man is God in human flesh the son of God is God entering into human flesh if I got that yeah okay that's why you call this the song god dispensation because it was God in man yes but the son of man is God Himself can't a human flesh okay everybody got that but let's see what for meat ain't what one like unto the Son of Man because John sees him standing here and remember John's right here in time wise time wise John's in the first church angels he don't know anything about all these others know yet because Jesus has got to identify who he is and where he is who is and where he is before he can begin to church ages because John then says hey it's Christ in this age Christ in this age and this state this state this age and they say no I just in the first page in the last day alpha know meet up all in between all right right there was just more seed this was this was the what the foundation church and this is going to be the headstone or the ending Church cornerstone hence dumb because remember the cornerstone came that's going didn't comment on the first Earth Day okay the headstone came here who D son of man right look let's hold it down but he was clothed with the garment down to his feet and gird about the paths now we're all adults here so we know what that is breast okay Pat's its breast so why was he or chest you can say but Pat's means breath anywhere in a Bible you say why in the world that kind of looks weird that's the form he's in he's in a woman form now called his bride yes right Amen now watch what he says locked into man clothed with a garment down to the foot and dirt dirt our God a piece of cloth about the paps with a golden girdle signifying that he's going to be in a feminist form called the bride now Jesus is not a female but when John looks at and you look at this whole thing this is the church ages yet Church has always been what female we've been the FEMA part of Jesus Christ just like go back and listen to what brother Aaron he did aruba job well now I've had to have a female bride to reproduce yourself he cannot reproduce with what he had he had to have a bride Christ had to have a bride to reproduce yourself called on the day of Pentecost he came back to the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost birthed them into the body and they became the church are the bride of Jesus Christ he didn't have a bride when he's on earth did not did have a one now one person was born again bride even John the Baptist that the Bible said was full of the Holy Ghost maybe one minutes all right that's right it wasn't in his soul or he'd been a born-again believer but the Bible says what though Jesus says huh you think John so great John Baptist now not John the Revelator done badness you think John the Baptist was so great the least one of that 120 in the upper room is greater than John the mammoth because why John the Baptist what in the kingdom he was there to introduce from the Old Testament to the New Testament he introduced Christ and then Christ did the work could dumb one off the same same way in the end time I'm just gonna be playing that's my brother ends not with us that's why God took him off the same because you're not going to share the glory with nobody I mean he's gonna have a mini member bride just like he did it he just types in every way all the way down and it's real consistent how that God is God to him you say God's got to yeah he he said he did he's gotta have her bride to reproduce yourself he said that cuz remember the light like real and go back to Genesis everything started in Genesis had to have a male/female relationship even with the animals to reproduce so you gotta have on they own you die off amen that's right that's just the way God said it so that's just the way he started it and you know what that's what he's gonna end it even with a bride but she's not gonna be a baby bride she's gonna be able at or full-grown bride that's it all right but she's got a golden girl so she's got the pouch he's had in his hair were white like wool let me ask you a question now there's going to be this this scenario is going to be all the way over in Revelations 21 oh my goodness is 10 20 come on we got to go stop no we'll take this stuff
