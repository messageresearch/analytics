[0:15] we're going to read
[0:17] second peter
[0:19] 1. a little patient
[0:22] that's okay if we stay on patients a
[0:24] little bit longer maybe
[0:25] help us have
[0:27] uh
[0:45] come on come on test him one two three
[0:47] four five six seven eight nine
[0:52] hello hello
[0:54] i can get this thing working but i can't
[0:57] okay patience according to his divine
[0:59] power had given unto us all things that
[1:01] pretended unto the life and godliness
[1:04] through the knowledge of him that had
[1:05] called us to glory and virtue
[1:08] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:10] great and precious promises that by
[1:11] these you might be partakers of the
[1:13] divine nature so we're talking about the
[1:15] divine nature of something
[1:17] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:19] the world through lust and besides this
[1:21] give all diligence and to your faith
[1:23] virtue
[1:24] already been through those to virtue
[1:27] knowledge knowledge temperance
[1:29] temperance patience into patience
[1:32] godliness so the next one we're coming
[1:34] up to is godliness
[1:36] and it's right up there getting up close
[1:38] to the top
[1:39] but we got to get through patience first
[1:41] patience we said was steadfast
[1:44] constancy endurance all right
[1:47] then we read scriptures those who endure
[1:49] to the end and then hebrews or hebrews
[1:54] 6 15 talking about abraham so after he
[1:57] had patiently endured see everybody
[1:58] wants to our problem with patience is is
[2:01] like the old saying is june's
[2:04] um
[2:05] mother-in-law had it over in the kitchen
[2:07] god give me patience but i want it now
[2:09] not my mother
[2:11] mom no well your
[2:13] stepmom there we go
[2:19] but she it was on her it was in her
[2:21] kitchen it says no real it says
[2:25] lord give me patience but i want it now
[2:27] well that's kind of not the way
[2:29] we want to deal with this
[2:31] because let us run with patience the
[2:34] race that is set before us
[2:36] after he had patiently endured so we
[2:38] there's something we got to go through
[2:40] in other words this is the journey that
[2:41] we have to go through
[2:44] and sure we we've got to become a
[2:45] christian first we've got to go through
[2:47] like bro hank you know it wants to be
[2:49] baptized in the different ones
[2:52] you've got to be baptized but the first
[2:53] thing you got to do the bible says
[2:55] repent
[2:56] all right and we have to repent every
[2:58] day because as christians we make
[2:59] mistakes and we do wrong if you don't
[3:01] repent every day then you're just a lot
[3:03] better off than i am because i have to
[3:05] repent every day
[3:07] ain't a day that goes by that i don't
[3:08] repent for something that i do amen man
[3:13] i'm talking about even little things you
[3:15] know we were talking about last
[3:16] night well
[3:18] something was brought up about lying
[3:21] that when you become born again you
[3:23] don't lie well now what's inside of you
[3:25] don't lie
[3:27] but brother branham told a big lie
[3:30] it was a little one but he told a big
[3:32] one
[3:34] didn't he
[3:35] yeah
[3:36] he said he did
[3:38] talk said tell him i'm not here well he
[3:40] went outside
[3:42] when he went to pray for that baby
[3:44] the holy ghost said get your dirty hands
[3:46] a prophet
[3:48] going to pray with a gift with an angel
[3:50] with all these gifts and things you know
[3:52] that we don't have
[3:54] and the holy spirit said don't put your
[3:55] dirty hands on that baby
[3:58] but what happened it was in his
[3:59] conscience
[4:01] it wasn't his soul it was in his
[4:02] conscience and that's when we do all of
[4:04] our all these
[4:06] uh virtues to me it's working on our
[4:08] conscience
[4:09] that the second realm that spirit realm
[4:11] the memory reason conscious and
[4:13] imagination that's where these
[4:16] virtues develop from
[4:18] because they're already in your soul yes
[4:21] you don't receive yes
[4:25] patience when you get born again you got
[4:27] pace that born again
[4:29] person that genesis one person has
[4:32] patience already right it's just inside
[4:35] you
[4:37] waiting on you
[4:38] to get rid of you
[4:41] to get it out that's right because it
[4:43] works from the inside out it doesn't
[4:44] work from the outside in see working
[4:46] from the outside in is like clogging i
[4:48] were talking about last night that's
[4:49] that's reformation
[4:51] that's alcoholics anonymous that's
[4:53] reforming somebody
[4:54] alcoholics anonymous says once an
[4:56] alcoholic you're always an alcoholic
[4:59] no if you'll get born again you might
[5:01] have been one but you'll never be
[5:02] another an alcoholic that's wiped away
[5:04] and done clean
[5:06] because it's devils that we deal with
[5:09] deals with medicine and they deal with
[5:11] psychology and they deal with natural
[5:13] drugs which there's nothing wrong with
[5:14] that
[5:16] all right there's nothing wrong with
[5:17] that okay
[5:19] but we deal as christians we should deal
[5:21] on the spiritual side
[5:23] where god said hey if i took it away
[5:25] from you
[5:27] it's gone it's right it's done
[5:30] and you can't reform yourself you can
[5:32] try to do it like you know smoking and
[5:34] stuff you can try to quit you can
[5:35] suppress that thing you can push it down
[5:37] and you can you can stand on top of it
[5:40] and you should do that
[5:42] but then you've got to do like brother
[5:44] tom von bush said he's he said god take
[5:46] away the need and the desire that's
[5:49] right see that's the right approach take
[5:51] away the need and because your body
[5:53] needs that
[5:55] right
[5:56] sure it doesn't need it but it needs it
[5:58] because when i was dipping that my body
[6:00] needed that nicotine
[6:03] it was a drug right it's like any other
[6:05] drug it's a drop it needed it knows you
[6:07] you ain't a good meal
[6:09] you want a smoke cigarette boy
[6:11] well i want i put a dip in my mouth yes
[6:14] but it's a it's really it's it's
[6:16] it's what's in your body
[6:19] and sure you can run and you can clean
[6:21] it out and you can but still that
[6:22] devil's there
[6:24] but see you get that unclean spirit out
[6:27] right and whenever the unclean spirit
[6:28] went out of me i knew
[6:31] that it was over because i had no more
[6:33] desire i mean that was no more than just
[6:35] picking this up you know
[6:38] same way with hank he it's no it's no
[6:41] problem to just do that because it's
[6:43] what his body is craving number one the
[6:46] need
[6:47] and the desire you got a desire to quit
[6:50] the thing that's right
[6:52] but when brother tom prayed that said
[6:53] god don't just don't just fill me with
[6:56] the holy ghost don't just do
[6:57] take away the need and the desire of
[6:59] that because the body is still going to
[7:01] crave it
[7:03] but when that unclean spirit goes out
[7:06] that's when you know that you won't ever
[7:08] need another one you want you can look i
[7:09] mean there's people
[7:11] uh
[7:12] smoking a room and
[7:14] old smokers you know they usually
[7:16] especially you know somebody just
[7:17] naturally quit smoking they kind of
[7:20] you know they get that little urge
[7:22] but once that thing's gone
[7:24] once that thing left me with with the
[7:26] dipping and all the chewing tobacco and
[7:28] stuff i mean i've got friends that do it
[7:30] all the time and
[7:32] it no more bothers me than
[7:35] than anything else why because that need
[7:37] and the desire is gone
[7:39] but god's drove that unclean spirit out
[7:40] i can't drive it out same way with these
[7:43] virtues i can't give myself patience
[7:46] that's right i can't give myself
[7:47] knowledge i can't but when i bring what
[7:49] i have
[7:50] now here's the key
[7:51] i kind of thought about this other day
[7:54] excuse me
[7:56] when i bring what i have which is the
[7:58] holy ghost when i bring that hole it
[8:00] goes into a place that's right
[8:02] to where he can he he can hear you say
[8:04] here he is god yeah he is god but
[8:06] brother brown said he was in there
[8:08] waiting on you to bring the word because
[8:09] that word is what's going to quicken
[8:11] this whole thing that's right the word's
[8:13] the key
[8:14] that's why the word's so important it's
[8:16] not alcoholics anonymous we're not just
[8:17] trying to live a good life because of uh
[8:21] alcoholics anonymous or what they say
[8:23] the power of positive thinking
[8:25] now that's close
[8:26] that's real close because you got to
[8:28] start thinking positive
[8:30] but you think positive under the auspice
[8:33] of the message of not even the message
[8:35] of the hour the word that's right the
[8:37] bible you look at the bible and you see
[8:39] that there was many things ray have the
[8:41] harlot
[8:42] uh you see the woman at the well you see
[8:44] the
[8:45] the woman that washed jesus his feet he
[8:47] said your sins are forgiving you he said
[8:49] go and sin no more well i don't believe
[8:51] that woman went back to being a
[8:52] prostitute i don't think ray have the
[8:54] harlot she married an israeli general
[8:57] and god brought the seed of david
[8:59] through that well go down to jesus if
[9:01] you want to that's okay but that's in
[9:03] the spiritual part but the natural seed
[9:05] line was king david right i'm talking
[9:08] about from
[9:10] ray hammond solomon to boat to obed to
[9:12] boaz right to david come right through a
[9:15] prostitute that's right
[9:17] so
[9:18] god can clean these things up
[9:21] and and do some i said well i say weird
[9:24] things because it's weird to me in the
[9:26] old testament but when you take the
[9:27] woman at the well and people like that i
[9:29] don't think they it's never recorded but
[9:31] once you meet god on that
[9:34] basis
[9:35] and he says go and sin no more
[9:38] i think it's done
[9:40] that's what you've got to see in your
[9:42] life you got to say that god is going to
[9:43] say to you go and sin no more yeah
[9:46] right just wait
[9:48] how is it that david could come through
[9:49] right half of harlot and you're not
[9:51] supposed to come in
[9:52] ten generations i don't know
[9:55] i don't understand that okay
[9:58] i don't understand that at all
[10:00] clark's gonna touch on a little bit of
[10:02] it today about the 400 generation
[10:05] how could david come through a harlot's
[10:07] womb when they
[10:09] considered that a bastard child
[10:12] but you got to remember one thing
[10:15] when rey have the harlot
[10:19] when they when jericho was destroyed
[10:23] if you have no witnesses
[10:25] she was just rahab
[10:27] it's true
[10:28] that's true it's true she was just rahab
[10:31] she was a harlot she you can't go back
[10:34] and fix all that right but god done
[10:37] something to that woman because she took
[10:39] that atonement
[10:40] the red string she hung it out the
[10:42] window well god just killed all of her
[10:44] accusers
[10:45] that's right
[10:46] what did jesus say to the woman
[10:51] what jesus said to the woman they throw
[10:52] the woman down and said
[10:53] we caught her in the act of adoption
[10:55] what do you say
[10:56] that's right
[10:58] in other words if i would have been
[10:59] there he said i didn't see it
[11:03] and then he starts getting rid of the
[11:05] woman's accusers because he knew if they
[11:07] hung around long enough they would have
[11:08] to stone her brother branham said that
[11:10] because they had been with them
[11:14] why i don't know but they are conscious
[11:17] because jesus would keep saying whoever
[11:19] has the no sin catch the first stone
[11:21] that's right well jesus knew if he could
[11:23] get rid of her accusers
[11:26] he didn't see it happen
[11:28] now if jesus would have seen that one
[11:30] committed adultery he'd had a stoner
[11:32] that's right
[11:33] see that's why jesus don't see our sins
[11:36] he hears our voice through the blood
[11:39] even a sinner's covered by the blood of
[11:41] jesus christ
[11:42] right a sinner's even covered right
[11:44] right now there's a blood covering over
[11:46] the earth
[11:47] that's here for everybody yes because
[11:50] brother brown said if he even saw us one
[11:52] second without the blood he'd have to
[11:54] kill us because these things are against
[11:55] god these are contrary amen okay now the
[11:58] one inside he won't destroy that's right
[12:00] but this right here he'd have to destroy
[12:02] because it was born in sin it was born
[12:03] totally contrary to what god wanted
[12:05] that's right all right but it was
[12:07] allowed
[12:08] then he had that blood covering because
[12:10] he stood as a lamb slain before the
[12:12] foundation of the world all right
[12:15] so let me ask you a question i don't
[12:16] know
[12:17] what about ruth
[12:20] ruth was a mole bite that's right is
[12:22] that right that's right now the bible
[12:24] clearly says and clark's going to read
[12:25] it today if he gets to it in deuteronomy
[12:27] it says the ammites
[12:29] ammonites
[12:30] and the moabites cannot enter
[12:34] into the temple for the 400 for the gen
[12:36] 400 generation
[12:38] 400 years 400 years well 400 years 10
[12:42] generations that's 400 years right
[12:45] now here's ruth
[12:47] there's the moabite
[12:50] maybe it's talking about the mail though
[12:53] you don't say well it says bastard child
[12:55] it doesn't say bastard ma'am
[12:57] somebody didn't know enter an end
[13:02] no it says a child a bastard child can't
[13:04] name him
[13:06] maybe it's talking about the male scene
[13:08] not being a little bite
[13:10] she was a mobile so anyway she was an
[13:12] old bite
[13:14] she couldn't suppose she wasn't supposed
[13:16] to have nothing to do with boaz that's
[13:18] right well see we as gentiles
[13:22] shouldn't have nothing to do with christ
[13:24] that's setting up the title right
[13:26] he came to get his own people which was
[13:28] the jewish people right israel was here
[13:31] israel was his right
[13:34] but here we are gentiles we were we
[13:36] didn't care if there was a god but he
[13:38] came to get us because he knew once that
[13:41] we would see him
[13:42] what would happen he knew what would go
[13:44] on uh brother jones you have your hand
[13:46] up
[13:47] oh go ahead guess what i thought about a
[13:49] bastard job man somebody didn't believe
[13:51] in the lord
[13:52] no that in that it was a bastard child
[13:55] with a child born out of weight loss
[13:57] okay that's that's a definition between
[13:59] that yeah master child is a child born
[14:01] out of wedlock does not have a
[14:04] marital
[14:05] father
[14:06] but not today not today no not today now
[14:09] that doesn't mean today if you were if
[14:11] you were born out of wedlock today
[14:13] the blood of jesus christ covered you
[14:15] because remember that was under the
[14:16] blood of bulls and goats that's right
[14:18] okay which only would
[14:21] move sin it would push it back it didn't
[14:23] do away with sin
[14:25] and god hated that thing so much so he
[14:27] would not he you know what it is the
[14:29] type of us keeping this congregation
[14:31] clean because we don't allow bastards to
[14:33] come in here
[14:35] now there you go spiritual not to the
[14:36] natural yeah
[14:38] okay
[14:39] because the bastard child remember if
[14:40] you can't take correction the bible says
[14:42] you're a bastard child now whether you
[14:44] were born of godly parents or not if you
[14:46] don't take correction you're a master
[14:48] child so they put that that bastard in
[14:50] there which is a child that's born out
[14:53] of weight loss which means you can't
[14:54] take correction which means in other
[14:55] words you weren't born of him that's
[14:57] right you weren't born of god you
[14:59] weren't born of jesus christ you wasn't
[15:01] part of that genesis 1 26 man
[15:03] which is the children of god
[15:06] there's a place in the bible where it
[15:07] talks about mercy being extended for
[15:09] more generations navigations
[15:12] so that covers it absolutely sure
[15:15] because remember
[15:17] even though that law says that for 400
[15:20] years a bastard child can't enter in
[15:22] his lineage after 400 years could go
[15:24] back in
[15:28] so it wasn't forever in eternity that's
[15:30] right
[15:31] there was grace there but god was going
[15:33] to keep that thing out until it weeded
[15:35] itself out
[15:36] but even after 400 years they were
[15:38] allowed back in they kept records
[15:40] hey they kept records and they knew what
[15:42] went on and they knew what was going on
[15:44] and they kept records and after 400
[15:46] years that bloodline could go back into
[15:48] the temple if there was nothing happen
[15:49] between in that 400 years and that was a
[15:52] lot of people
[15:54] that's a lot of people between when it
[15:56] happened
[15:58] and 400 years later right
[16:00] the united states is only a couple
[16:02] hundred years old so man it's you know
[16:03] you're looking at 400 years
[16:05] but now i've come to that accountability
[16:08] if you would bastard or whatever you
[16:10] want
[16:11] and you're you get saved or born again
[16:14] that cuts all that off yeah when jesus
[16:16] died at calvary and and gave his life
[16:18] for us then we have the perpetuation now
[16:21] that he can do away with that
[16:24] situation because remember you didn't
[16:25] have nothing to do with it
[16:27] okay you're having to do with it so
[16:29] god will
[16:31] god will not a bastard child is one that
[16:33] won't take correction now that's what
[16:34] the new testament comes up now and says
[16:36] all right
[16:37] i don't care how holy you were born
[16:40] if you if you
[16:42] go against the word of god or you don't
[16:43] take correction
[16:45] then you're just like that bastard child
[16:47] that was in the old testament that
[16:49] physically couldn't enter into the
[16:51] temple right
[16:53] and and i didn't say that god did all
[16:55] right so we have to deal with that
[16:58] but we remember
[17:01] with ray having all these ones and types
[17:03] in the old testament
[17:04] that there is grace everybody sees the
[17:07] law in the old testament but man i see
[17:09] grace when i see ray happen right
[17:12] i see grace when i see ruth yes
[17:15] i see grace when i see these people that
[17:17] um
[17:18] that do things that seemingly is wrong
[17:21] that would be wrong now like having a
[17:23] prophet go marry a prostitute yes boy
[17:26] you better not do that in the new
[17:27] testament
[17:30] see what i mean but the old testament
[17:32] carried over and that's why that now
[17:34] let's bring it back to patience that's
[17:35] why that word patience is not in the old
[17:38] testament
[17:39] that word patience don't look up that
[17:41] word there's no word patience now
[17:42] abraham had patience right job had
[17:45] patience but it was only when paul come
[17:47] over and wrote about it in the new
[17:48] testament he showed that they had
[17:50] patience
[17:52] but they patience was not dealt with in
[17:54] the old testament because they weren't
[17:55] born again they didn't have anything to
[17:57] keep him patient
[17:59] job was a type and so was abraham was a
[18:02] type
[18:03] because remember abraham is not my
[18:06] father
[18:07] genetically
[18:09] okay abraham's not my father genetically
[18:12] but he is my father he is the father of
[18:14] the faith

[20:37] uh hank and martha that brother branham
[20:39] was walking through uh
[20:41] he was walking through a field one day
[20:43] going to pray for a man or any way he
[20:45] stopped on the side of the road and
[20:47] instead of going around the field he cut
[20:49] through the field jumped over the fence
[20:50] and went through the field well there
[20:51] was a killer bull in that fence that had
[20:53] already killed one man
[20:55] and had the big horns and he was huge
[20:57] and everything you know
[21:00] and
[21:01] he charged brother branham and brother
[21:02] brown said now look patience makes love
[21:04] and when that bull got within six to
[21:06] eight feet of me he just threw his feet
[21:08] out and stopped
[21:09] and he looked at me he looked this way
[21:11] he looked that way so depleted just
[21:13] quietened right down walked over and
[21:14] laid down i walked within five feet of
[21:16] that bull and he never even turned and
[21:18] looked at me i walked right out of that
[21:20] pasture what is it it was the love of
[21:22] god
[21:23] the power of god
[21:25] he had come to a place where he had
[21:27] patience
[21:28] he didn't turn around and run when the
[21:30] bull came
[21:32] stood his ground all right
[21:34] but what something came over him
[21:37] super natural not naturals natural we'd
[21:40] turn around
[21:41] but supernatural took over
[21:43] and his patience through suffering he's
[21:45] telling the story
[21:47] works tribulation to bring patients of
[21:49] course now patience makes love so being
