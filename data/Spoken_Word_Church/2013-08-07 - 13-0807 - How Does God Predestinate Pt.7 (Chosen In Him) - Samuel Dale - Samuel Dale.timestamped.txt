[4:35] I or when was it yesterday or something
[4:37] any I said the only problem was that I
[4:39] wish I'd married her two years before
[4:41] and that would have made me 16 her 14
[4:44] yeah but we made it up to where I was 18
[4:47] she was 16 cuz if ID have married her I
[4:49] wouldn't have got out in the world into
[4:51] you know life and things as much and all
[4:54] so I I wish I had her but that's the way
[4:57] God has it ordained to be right and I
[5:00] believe it and I love her and I I really
[5:02] cherish her I appreciate her cuz she's
[5:04] been the the backbone of the family
[5:07] she's the one that keeps them all
[5:09] straight I just kind of run around with
[5:11] a little Whip and crack it every once in
[5:13] a while but the she keeps them all
[5:15] straight keeps it going but we
[5:17] appreciate her amen I wish everybody in
[5:21] the world had a wife like my wife I
[5:24] didn't say I wish everybody had a w my
[5:27] wife yeah man it work one time he tried
[5:30] his best to trade with me and it's
[5:32] because he's such a good cook and we
[5:35] took in some food you know and he said
[5:37] anytime you get ready to trade wise I'll
[5:39] just trade with you see because your
[5:41] wife is a good cook you know and she is
[5:44] amen amen all right Romans 8 and
[5:49] Ephesians 1 is any other announcements
[5:51] which in me we generally forget
[5:56] Something Heavenly Father we thank you
[5:59] for tonight tonight and your love and
[6:00] your grace and your kindness thank you
[6:02] for Calvary thank you for all the things
[6:04] Lord that you've given unto us and thank
[6:07] you Father tonight especially for
[6:10] salvation and then in the secondary form
[6:13] we thank you for a wife that's been with
[6:15] us for 55 years Lord and we thank you
[6:18] for the love that she's had for us and
[6:20] to stand beside of us and knowing I know
[6:23] that it's been a hard road because she
[6:25] just didn't understand me and I know
[6:27] that but yet she stood right there with
[6:29] me and always been there we thank you
[6:32] for that we ask you to be with us
[6:33] tonight in the service bless and guide
[6:35] each and every one of us the father we
[6:37] love you and we thank you in Jesus name
[6:43] amen Romans
[6:47] 8
[6:50] 28-31 and we know that all things work
[6:52] together for good to them that love God
[6:54] to them who are the called according to
[6:57] his purpose for whom he did did for know
[7:00] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[7:03] to the image of his son that he might be
[7:05] the first born among many Brethren
[7:08] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[7:11] he also called and whom he called them
[7:12] he also
[7:14] Justified and whom he justified them he
[7:17] also glorified what shall we then say to
[7:20] these things if God be for us who can be
[7:24] against us what a great statement right
[7:28] now let's go to Ephesians 1
[7:30] 1 and we'll start with verse
[7:33] three down through verse
[7:36] 14 blessed be the God and father of our
[7:39] Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with
[7:41] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[7:43] places in Christ according as he has
[7:46] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[7:48] of the world that we should be holy and
[7:50] Without Blame before him in love having
[7:53] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[7:55] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[7:58] according to the good pleasure of his
[7:59] will to the praise of the glory of his
[8:02] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[8:05] in the Beloved in whom we have
[8:08] Redemption through his blood the
[8:10] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[8:12] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[8:14] abounded to toward us in all wisdom and
[8:17] Prudence now what I want you to do the
[8:19] reason I'm going from verse uh the
[8:22] thought will be taken from verse
[8:26] 4-6 but what I want you to think about
[8:31] is all of this
[8:33] here is what has
[8:36] happened to us here in this world right
[8:40] amen all right that's my whole point now
[8:44] is we you'll get back and you'll see
[8:46] what I'm talking about so then catch the
[8:48] point now in whom we have Redemption
[8:51] where at here through his blood the
[8:54] Forgiveness of sins according now surely
[8:56] we'd want to know that would be here but
[8:59] according to the riches of his grace
[9:01] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[9:03] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[9:05] known unto us the mystery of his will
[9:08] Prophet said that is to adopt us
[9:10] according to his good pleasure which he
[9:12] had purposed in himself that in the
[9:14] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[9:17] might gather together in one all things
[9:20] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[9:22] which are on earth even in him in whom
[9:26] also we have obtained an inheritance
[9:29] being predestinated according to the
[9:31] purpose of him who worketh all things
[9:33] after the counsel of his own will that
[9:36] we should be to the praise of his glory
[9:38] who first trusted in
[9:41] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[9:44] that that you heard the word of Truth
[9:47] The Gospel of your salvation in whom
[9:50] also after that you believed you were
[9:52] sealed with that notice Holy Spirit of
[9:56] Promise which is the earnest of the of
[9:58] our inheritance until the Redemption of
[10:01] the purchased possession unto the praise
[10:04] of his glory amen and you may be seated
[10:08] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[10:09] of the word now uh I brought brother Joe
[10:13] ran these off a moment ago and uhu it's
[10:16] all of the the uh list and things of the
[10:21] video streaming and it was very odd
[10:24] because I've never noticed this place
[10:26] before to appear
[10:29] maybe it has but you know and I'm sure
[10:32] it has but in a place called poo Alto I
[10:37] guess you'd say it p a l o and a l t o
[10:41] California in July alone there was
[10:46] 575
[10:48] hits the most of
[10:51] all p a l o a l t o pal California
[10:56] 576 what the odd part is
[11:01] we were only H 7 days into August
[11:04] there's already been 160
[11:07] hits from them so uh somebody's
[11:11] listening am you know it must be a whole
[11:13] lot of them so uh we say welcome you
[11:16] know welcome I I don't remember seeing
[11:18] that before I'm sure it has been on
[11:20] there but you know but we say to you
[11:23] welcome uh just do the best you can
[11:26] putting up with me in my ways and trying
[11:29] to explain myself all right they three
[11:31] hours behind yeah and they're three
[11:33] hours behind us so that puts a a doing
[11:36] it amen they're going to
[11:38] be later all right but now what have we
[11:42] been talking
[11:44] about how does
[11:48] God
[11:50] predestinate Amen all right we've
[11:53] covered this then in
[11:56] uh trying to show and we had a the
[12:00] picture brother Joe has it on the the
[12:02] internet thing and if any of you need
[12:04] these we just made off a little drawing
[12:07] to where that you could kind of see the
[12:09] things that that we have put we split a
[12:12] part called as mind you notice a line
[12:15] going through and we got God Elohim
[12:17] self-existing now the service tonight if
[12:21] I can get it into the way that I want to
[12:24] it will be borderlining in between these
[12:27] two
[12:29] it'll be connecting to both places and
[12:32] that's what I said now from verse 7 on
[12:35] through in our
[12:36] readings we we know for a certainty that
[12:39] that's in life and journey and you know
[12:43] the things here in this world all right
[12:47] but we know also that for
[12:51] knowledge is the greatest thing of all
[12:54] because we used to think predestination
[12:57] was but then we begin to pay close
[12:59] attention to what the prophet was saying
[13:03] and he says about five or six times that
[13:06] you know predestination looks back to
[13:08] for
[13:10] knowledge he said then for knowledge
[13:12] will look forward to to Destiny am and
[13:15] then we covered our uh the P service
[13:19] that predestination would look back to
[13:23] election but election goes all the way
[13:25] and looks back to for knowledge so we
[13:27] covered you know make your call calling
[13:29] an election sure right in other words be
[13:32] sure that you know what you're talking
[13:34] about right that's what Paul was saying
[13:37] make your
[13:39] calling and election sure in other words
[13:44] know how they're
[13:46] doing what transpires all right see
[13:49] because we know that many are called but
[13:52] only a few are
[13:54] chosen but how come are they chosen now
[13:56] that's what we're going to get into
[13:57] tonight we read there in Ephesians that
[14:01] we were chosen in him before the
[14:04] foundation of the
[14:06] world all right now how does God
[14:14] choose without being a respector of
[14:19] persons so we went over it and over it
[14:21] and over it with the
[14:23] quotes of looking at for
[14:26] knowledge and seeing that God
[14:28] predestined Ates by forn
[14:30] knowledge or fora
[14:33] forne whatever words you want to use in
[14:36] that we went into one time speaking of
[14:39] in in the mind of
[14:42] God but we've been trying to Define some
[14:45] things or divide them I have to where
[14:47] that we can uh better understand in
[14:50] reading the scriptures I said if we
[14:52] would read them I've always said you
[14:54] know if we just read the
[14:56] scriptures but read them with this
[14:58] common
[15:00] sense you know you said well you mean
[15:03] we're not
[15:05] common no we were blinded by doctrines
[15:09] and ideas of man and no matter what we
[15:12] read in the word it never corrected
[15:16] those doctrines and
[15:18] ideas we just bypassed that I remember
[15:21] brother Tatum saying one time he he was
[15:24] beginning to see the water baptism and
[15:26] he said he would read you know Matthew
[15:28] 28:9 wasn't so bad but when he get over
[15:30] acts 238 said he wanted to pass over
[15:33] that because there was something there
[15:35] that was bothering him well it bothered
[15:38] him until he got it straight then when
[15:41] he got it straight then he he he got it
[15:43] done am all right and see if you just
[15:47] read the
[15:48] scripture read it as they
[15:53] said we can look back in for knowledge
[15:56] and look back in uh predestin
[15:58] destination and
[16:00] things but the two things we're going to
[16:02] deal with and we'll try to get to it
[16:04] more at the end of the
[16:06] message is what we read that Paul says
[16:10] that we were chosen in him right before
[16:14] the foundation of the world Amen all
[16:18] right then it goes on to about verse
[16:24] six and it says that he's made us
[16:27] accepted
[16:31] but that's not dividing the point of
[16:34] just accepting
[16:39] you but it says he's accepting Us in the
[16:45] Beloved see if you left out that part
[16:48] you would just say what we just accepted
[16:51] us and then we can say well the choosing
[16:53] is just you know well he chose me
[16:56] because you know I I'm a I'm a
[16:58] predestinated
[17:00] seed all right all that's well and
[17:04] true but hard do we've been through with
[17:07] the
[17:08] prophet that he didn't even choose by
[17:11] right his own desires right
[17:14] amen he never predestinated by his own
[17:19] desires he really predestinated by our
[17:22] desires you know what we desire amen all
[17:26] right we've been through service after
[17:29] service trying to hold a point to where
[17:32] of looking at it of saying well hey
[17:35] look God being
[17:39] infinite had the ability to set back
[17:42] there in
[17:43] eternity before even atoms or molecules
[17:46] or anything came into being for Angels
[17:50] or or anything that he could sit back
[17:53] there as infinite God and with his
[17:57] infinite wisdom wisdom amen he could
[18:00] think
[18:02] about you know world and Mankind and and
[18:06] he knew that if he created
[18:10] us that we'd fall right amen he knew
[18:14] that why did he create us then to
[18:18] display his attributes of Savior healer
[18:24] Etc but he couldn't make us fall right
[18:27] amen
[18:29] he cannot override our free moral agency
[18:32] that's right amen
[18:34] true he can't do that
[18:37] see so then he goes by what we
[18:41] choose and he could look down and see us
[18:44] of what we would choose after we got
[18:47] here
[18:48] amen so I'd rather approach it that way
[18:52] you know all of these doctrines and they
[18:54] got their ideas and oh I was a
[18:56] predestinated seed and and if I happen
[18:58] to come from Adam I can be saved but if
[19:01] I come from the Beast I can't be and try
[19:03] to get all these natural gen seeds in
[19:06] there you know and and the scripture
[19:09] said it's not a and the promise wasn't
[19:11] even to Abraham and his natural seed
[19:14] right amen amen but it was through the
[19:17] promise right all right but yet you're
[19:20] not going to change anybody's mind about
[19:22] those thoughts right I don't try to do
[19:25] that I try to preach to you here and if
[19:28] anybody else is listening let it go down
[19:31] into their hearts and and see what's in
[19:33] their hearts and lives and let God deal
[19:35] with them cuz that's all we can
[19:38] do but yet we know that he didn't choose
[19:41] one and reject the other so in Jacob and
[19:45] Esau it couldn't have been that he you
[19:49] know chose Jacob and and rejected
[19:53] Esau as we think of the word
[19:57] choosing
[19:58] but yet he saw what they would
[20:01] do all right then he could go ahead and
[20:04] write it
[20:05] down he could even write the Bible about
[20:07] what you and I would
[20:11] do surely we believe we're in the age of
[20:14] Lady see people's rights right that's
[20:17] right and falling
[20:20] apart conquer the leoty right amen
[20:23] right well if we can see that why can't
[20:26] we see that there's also another side of
[20:29] that because that was the scriptures we
[20:31] use and showed that some were
[20:34] foreordained unto this condemnation
[20:39] right that's
[20:42] scripture because God knew the way they
[20:45] would
[20:47] go but yet the way that I've always said
[20:50] it and I love it he didn't stay up in
[20:54] heaven and just predetermine it stap it
[20:57] go over to the other end sit down and
[20:58] wait on us now he come down here to live
[21:01] with
[21:04] us don't you think that his uh Infinite
[21:08] Wisdom would let him know what was going
[21:11] to take place down in in uh Sodom and
[21:16] things but yet he said he come down to
[21:19] see if the things that were
[21:23] said were so amen amen he's a lovely God
[21:27] Amen so I'd rather believe in forn
[21:31] knowledge am and believe that God saw me
[21:35] as to accepting him as my
[21:40] savior I'd rather be that way than to
[21:43] try to approach it by some predetermined
[21:47] Factor
[21:50] right cuz amen the prophet said one time
[21:53] he said you know we talk about whosoever
[21:56] will see the people of the message they
[21:58] preach it to Big preachers they want to
[22:00] preach it that's not us that's foolish
[22:02] virgins and free moral agency only deals
[22:05] with foolish virgins and
[22:08] things but see I'd rather have whosoever
[22:11] will than to have my name written in the
[22:14] Bible that's what he said right he said
[22:17] because there's a lot of William
[22:20] Brams right but when you say whosoever
[22:23] will I can believe that's me amen that's
[22:27] right I want to stay in that line amen
[22:30] the point I'm trying to get you to see
[22:32] is I'm trying to drive it down you and I
[22:36] have a whole lot more to to do with this
[22:39] thing than we
[22:41] think amen cuz even like saying that we
[22:44] have nothing to do with our Salvation
[22:46] we're going to get through that tonight
[22:47] the Lord with
[22:49] it we don't have nothing to do with him
[22:55] dying right now you say Di for our sins
[22:58] that's fine but you know what I mean we
[23:00] don't do it we didn't do any
[23:04] part to kill
[23:08] him but we're
[23:10] here and why can't we believe that he
[23:13] died for
[23:16] us then why can't we believe
[23:19] that we do have something to
[23:24] do statue of a perfect man you're born
[23:28] again at
[23:31] Faith but then you got to grow up the
[23:34] pyramid right that's right not just lay
[23:36] back and wait the pyramid to fall on
[23:42] you but just think about it now because
[23:46] we're looking at
[23:48] Chosen and looking at accepted and both
[23:52] of them is in him
[23:55] right so the one that chose us
[23:58] accepted us
[24:00] amen right
[24:03] right then really
[24:06] truthfully it's not whether I'm chosen
[24:09] or
[24:10] not I'm not much concerned about that
[24:14] you said well I I am sure now I settled
[24:18] that a long time ago about you
[24:22] know being born again or
[24:25] not but you see if he was
[24:34] chosen then I can read that I was chosen
[24:37] in
[24:39] him but if I can't find that he was
[24:45] chosen yeah I I don't know what I've
[24:48] got
[24:51] right but see he you can say he chose me
[24:56] well then I can go back in into the for
[24:58] knowledge and and we can see how that's
[25:01] done right but the main thing is whether
[25:04] or
[25:05] not he was Joseph right
[25:11] y you what do you mean we know that well
[25:15] is it true that that's in our
[25:19] mind see then all I got to worry
[25:24] about is being in him amen
[25:31] right that's all I got to be concerned
[25:36] about if I know for a certainty he was
[25:44] chosen then I don't have to worry about
[25:46] whether I was chosen or
[25:50] not why because I was chosen in him
[25:53] right at the same time he was chosen
[25:57] well you sure sound like a
[26:00] trinitarian well I'll let you explain it
[26:06] yeah he was
[26:12] chosen all right and all I got to do is
[26:15] make sure that I make my calling in my
[26:20] election my choosing correct
[26:26] right like what does that scripture say
[26:29] uh where Jesus talking about I and you
[26:31] and you and me
[26:34] right well now it's easy to figure out
[26:37] you and
[26:38] me you
[26:41] know but how is he in
[26:45] us I in
[26:47] you and you in me right am you and me
[26:51] was settled before the foundation of the
[26:53] world
[26:55] right but I in you you is dealing with
[26:59] my life now that's right amen
[27:03] right and then we see that what that can
[27:06] go to the point of what
[27:09] that where Heath made us
[27:13] accepted in the
[27:18] Beloved I was reading one night the
[27:20] other day where the Prophet said that
[27:22] ought to make us run the A and
[27:25] rejoice to think about right yes Lord
[27:29] that we were chosen in him amen that we
[27:31] were accepted of
[27:34] him now if he accepted
[27:39] you I probably won't get on the notes
[27:42] anyway but if he accepted
[27:46] you there had to be some
[27:48] reason right
[27:51] sir are you listening amen sure there
[27:54] was some reason he accepted you right
[28:01] if not he just picking here and picking
[28:03] there and choosing one accepting one
[28:05] doing
[28:06] one there's got to be something about
[28:09] you the prophet said that God liked
[28:12] that's right you know I like that amen
[28:19] sir CU you see he accepted
[28:26] me
[28:28] remember what we were talking about
[28:32] David God said David I know your
[28:42] desires see an honest and the contrary
[28:44] heart was what God was looking at in
[28:48] David surely not his natural life and
[28:51] surely it wasn't in his genetic
[28:54] genes cuz if it was it short didn't mess
[28:57] up with
[28:59] basba to take a man's wife and have him
[29:01] killed to get his wife and then we think
[29:04] something could come through there to be
[29:05] holy right nothing need natural flesh is
[29:09] Holy at all
[29:10] amen
[29:16] amen but we make our calling and
[29:19] election sure other words find out how
[29:23] he done
[29:24] it we know he done it by four knowledge
[29:27] amen right that does
[29:30] not you know make him a respector of
[29:34] persons
[29:38] right he could stand back there before
[29:41] the world it just
[29:43] illustrating and look all the way
[29:46] through
[29:46] time and see the end of it if he can't
[29:50] he's not God that's
[29:55] right and I ask you a simple
[29:57] question to me I don't I don't have any
[30:02] problems is this what God saw or is this
[30:07] what God is
[30:13] seeing
[30:15] yeah I mean we do we want to get back
[30:18] here and look down
[30:23] there he's not back there and he's not
[30:26] over there right amen right he said I'll
[30:29] be with you always right amen he's here
[30:34] amen now come on folks a God over there
[30:38] ain't much help if I need him real quick
[30:41] he might be tied up on something and
[30:44] back there he might
[30:46] be if you don't like him terminologies
[30:49] you tell me something else to say and
[30:50] I'll say
[30:51] it to just show the
[30:55] point I'm kind of like the fell was that
[30:58] said he didn't want no
[30:59] secretaries you know when they asked or
[31:01] told him you know
[31:04] praying I don't I I want my calling an
[31:07] election sure I want to know there's
[31:09] just one true and living
[31:11] God and then he's not over there and
[31:13] he's not back
[31:15] there he's ever presentent which he's
[31:17] here right
[31:20] now see then that
[31:22] way I can think about how glorious it is
[31:26] to live in this
[31:28] life in the most horrible of conditions
[31:32] that we could ever exist
[31:34] in pain Agony or
[31:39] whatever heartaches
[31:43] troubles and still be happy
[31:52] amen see Church there is things coming
[31:54] rest we believe in that but why can't we
[31:57] be happy with what's here now
[32:00] amen that's right if we don't get this
[32:03] right here they ain't going to be no
[32:07] future
[32:09] right so why don't we live like it is
[32:12] here see I God off up in Yonder like
[32:15] I've always told you I know I'm dumb and
[32:18] ignorant and all that but God has helped
[32:20] me a little bit to try to explain
[32:22] something but see sometimes it' probably
[32:24] be a pretty good idea if there was three
[32:26] gods
[32:29] cuz that way I could pray to this and to
[32:31] pray to that and to pray to that one and
[32:33] maybe some way you know one of them to
[32:35] help
[32:38] me but I don't believe in
[32:42] that I believe there's one true and
[32:44] living God
[32:48] Amen and I'm not talking to a father
[32:51] that's a secretary or a son that's a
[32:53] something else I I want to talk to the
[32:55] head man amen amen
[33:00] Lord forgive me for terminologies like
[33:02] that but I can't say nothing
[33:06] else but think about
[33:10] it see my whole point of the message
[33:14] is we're chosen in him or were chosen in
[33:19] him if you want to put
[33:21] the
[33:23] when before the foundation of the world
[33:33] Amen and when he came
[33:40] here I was in him
[33:42] amen that's the part of me that's
[33:44] Eternal tonight am that's right not the
[33:47] Body Spirit soul of Samuel
[33:50] Dale with the soul of eternal life
[33:55] right and when he walked the shores of
[33:58] Galilee I walked the shores of Galilee
[34:00] that's right right am but when he died I
[34:02] died you know what he went to hell for
[34:05] me right amen but when he raised I
[34:08] raised
[34:11] amen I don't get back to that in a
[34:13] minute somebody remind me to get that
[34:16] quote about where he raised or not where
[34:18] brother R says it was and he uses some
[34:21] words that Webster don't have but you
[34:25] know cuz it had his own
[34:28] words just you know let me let me get
[34:31] that I sat there I lie sometimes with a
[34:34] third grade education that I mean the
[34:36] seventh grade education the man had and
[34:37] I got a ninth and I thought me and him
[34:40] could really
[34:41] talk am let me see if I can find
[34:45] it oh yeah go over to 9A
[34:48] brother brother
[34:50] Joe this is taken from law and Grace
[34:53] 1954 106 paragraph 1 68 while he's
[34:58] getting over to finding it there you
[35:02] go and look what he
[35:06] says am oh
[35:09] my how I love him is his grace nothing I
[35:13] could do nothing I could nothing you can
[35:15] do but we coming together as Christian
[35:19] men and women confesses that we're
[35:20] unworthy unworthy and accepting him in
[35:24] our stad accepting that one that I know
[35:26] just just as sure as God accepted
[35:29] him and raised him up he raised me in
[35:35] a figary there's no
[35:44] word form the same time he raised Christ
[35:49] amen I got to stop but look in a figure
[35:54] ter
[35:55] form
[35:59] and go on look at them the dictionary I
[36:00] hope you find some dictionary that's got
[36:02] it in it where we can get a definition
[36:05] but he said it was in
[36:07] a figary form or a figary
[36:12] form he raised me the same time he
[36:14] raised Christ he raised you the same
[36:17] time he raised Christ but that was for
[36:19] our justification
[36:21] amen the best definition I can come up
[36:25] in any way was
[36:27] the
[36:28] word
[36:30] figurative which means reesing
[36:33] representing by means of a figure or
[36:38] likeness
[36:43] no when he raised me when he raised
[36:47] up I didn't physically
[36:51] raise
[36:54] right come on he physically
[36:57] raised
[36:59] amen well my my body hadn't even been
[37:02] brought into existence as a body was l
[37:04] in the
[37:08] Earth but see then it goes on to say
[37:10] that that's the way we was
[37:14] accepted in the
[37:18] Beloved so it's a it it it means the
[37:23] best that I can Define it is a a basis
[37:25] of not
[37:29] physically but I was represented in
[37:33] him are you with me that's the best I
[37:36] can go with it I was represented in him
[37:41] in a
[37:43] form now what would that form
[37:49] be my body didn't raise when he
[37:55] raised
[37:59] so it means there's
[38:01] something within
[38:05] him and that's what's
[38:08] accepted that's right you and I as
[38:11] people are
[38:16] persons have to had to come in this
[38:20] life and accept
[38:24] him and then he could accept
[38:27] us
[38:29] remember not you accepted him that's
[38:32] right it's whether or not he accepted
[38:36] you all right so now if we were chosen
[38:39] in
[38:40] him and if we raised when he raised and
[38:44] we didn't raise physically you
[38:48] know tangible
[38:52] flesh but we raised in a form in him
[39:01] according to my Bible it says that
[39:04] if the spirit of him that raised up
[39:08] Jesus from the
[39:10] dead be in
[39:13] you it will change the
[39:18] form right it will
[39:21] Quicken your mortal
[39:24] body so there is a change in form
[39:30] amen so then before the world ever
[39:34] was the Bible says and I showed you on
[39:37] the thing that we used it that he stood
[39:40] as a lamb
[39:42] slain but that's over in here dealing
[39:46] with coming forth from his mind
[39:50] toward
[39:52] reality toward reality in doing see from
[39:58] here that way deals with all the things
[40:03] that will transpire and I don't mean all
[40:04] of these are all of them but the things
[40:06] that will transpire upon
[40:10] Earth the adoptions the becoming the
[40:13] word the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:14] justification sanctification calling an
[40:17] election choosing for
[40:19] knowledge even Cedar
[40:22] word cuz he knows where that cedar word
[40:24] will fall right amen
[40:29] so then think about
[40:31] it if we don't believe in
[40:37] predetermining then we believe
[40:40] that or much
[40:43] believe that in the mind of
[40:46] God not in an actual
[40:49] physical
[40:51] transpiring but in the mind of God he
[40:54] stood as a lamb slain before the
[40:56] foundation of the world
[40:58] right now if he had never come to that
[41:01] in this world that would have make that
[41:03] false prophecy but we know he did
[41:08] amen so then God could look down
[41:13] through and seeing it from back there he
[41:17] could predetermine
[41:19] it but he could look down
[41:22] through and see you wanting a savior
[41:28] amen all right that's
[41:31] right what is a predestinated
[41:34] seed or what is a
[41:38] nonseed the prophet say a nonseed
[41:41] there's nothing to
[41:44] Quicken nonseed is a seed that doesn't
[41:46] have a seed or a
[41:48] hybrid is another word for
[41:53] it but you see God looked down through
[41:57] and he saw that you would want to be
[42:02] saved that's his for
[42:05] knowledge you know
[42:07] what before the world he could
[42:09] predestinate that there no problem with
[42:12] me right see he could predetermine that
[42:16] you'd accept would come to
[42:20] him but you know what I like about
[42:23] it I still don't believe he stayed up
[42:26] there on vacation right
[42:30] amen how many of you can remember in
[42:33] your
[42:35] life maybe
[42:38] a accident or something or in your
[42:43] accident oh great tragedy that took
[42:50] place that you realize that there has to
[42:53] be a god somewhere MH right amen and
[42:56] that he was concerned enough to take
[42:58] care of me at that time when I wasn't
[43:00] serving
[43:02] him that's
[43:04] right before I started serving him I
[43:08] mean how many of
[43:10] you can think about in your life and
[43:13] just remember things that transpired
[43:16] that could have very easily taken your
[43:22] life but yet something happened amen
[43:30] right even
[43:32] until we told like with Josh where the
[43:37] people that was in the car behind him
[43:39] when he had that
[43:40] wreck they wanted to know where the
[43:42] other person was
[43:44] at it was in that
[43:47] car three people saw somebody get out of
[43:50] the car and walk
[43:55] away
[44:03] my
[44:04] point even though he knows what it'll
[44:09] be that's right he still loves to come
[44:14] down and fellowship with
[44:21] us and let us know how great he is amen
[44:28] that he could just know in
[44:31] it in the quote we had up there brother
[44:33] around
[44:35] says and just as the same
[44:38] time that he accepted
[44:42] Christ he accepted me in
[44:46] Christ amen on down close to the
[44:54] bottom
[44:57] at the same time he accepted him he
[45:01] accepted
[45:07] you when are we going to start realizing
[45:10] church
[45:11] that we have received a
[45:15] message to correct all of the ideas and
[45:20] thoughts that we once had
[45:23] and our worries and our
[45:26] burdens and things that we carried
[45:29] because we didn't know the
[45:31] answer and yet we can just read a simple
[45:34] prophet's message and God can speak to
[45:36] us and give an answer
[45:39] am
[45:41] chosen how does he choose by his forign
[45:46] knowledge or else you're making him pick
[45:49] one I've got one in here where he said
[45:50] well it's the first one go ahead not
[45:53] number nine Joe excuse me back up one
[45:55] where you were at number nine which is
[45:58] adoption uh part two
[46:03] 19658 he said I want to stop on that
[46:05] word of predestinated
[46:08] predestinated Now predestinated isn't
[46:10] say that's not what it is now I'll
[46:13] choose brother Neville and I won't
[46:15] choose brother beer that isn't it it's
[46:18] the for knowledge of God that knowed
[46:21] which one would be right and which one
[46:23] wasn't right so by for knowledge God
[46:26] knowing what he was going to do he
[46:28] predestinated by his full knowledge to
[46:31] make it all things work together for the
[46:34] good of them that love
[46:39] God what are we dealing
[46:44] with as I said the other day then in the
[46:46] message you know you hear the preachers
[46:48] of the message and the Le too oh if I
[46:52] just believe I was in the mind of God
[46:55] and if I in the mind of God
[46:57] then we just
[47:01] remember Judas is carot was in the mind
[47:04] of God
[47:08] right when he thought of Jesus Christ
[47:10] coming on
[47:11] Earth it was necessary that he think of
[47:14] Judas being there to betray
[47:18] him not to make him
[47:24] betray
[47:27] he would say oh he didn't have no choice
[47:29] he was a son of
[47:36] predition I believe he had a choice
[47:42] am I believe everybody has a
[47:48] choice because if he doesn't have a
[47:53] choice what what's God going going to do
[47:56] with
[47:58] it are you listening you
[48:01] know we see we want to lay on that we
[48:04] were
[48:05] chosen back there well that's
[48:08] wonderful but remember it was in
[48:13] him now the story is
[48:16] not that God was up there going one 2 3
[48:20] 4 leave that now 6 8 10 12 all them
[48:24] chosen now Jesus you go down and be the
[48:27] lamb that was slain before the
[48:29] foundation of the
[48:32] world now what kind of a God would that
[48:39] be but yet in his infinite mind and
[48:43] wisdom that he would even know as the
[48:46] prophet said that if he created us that
[48:48] we'd
[48:50] fall and said he had to put us on free
[48:52] moral agency amen
[48:57] and he had to put every man on free
[48:58] moral agency he
[49:03] said and then he would know our choice
[49:07] or our our choosing of which way to we
[49:10] wanted to
[49:12] go and there's any problem then he could
[49:14] write the Book of
[49:21] Life know is that a a point that we he
[49:24] would write one 's name into Lamb's Book
[49:26] of Life and leave another
[49:29] out would that be choosing no it would
[49:32] be because that he look down and
[49:41] seen and then see when he was accepted
[49:44] back
[49:46] there I was accepted in him
[49:50] amen that's the way I was
[49:54] chosen
[49:56] was in him by what by him being
[50:00] accepted he was chosen to do a job as
[50:04] poor we saying he was chosen to be come
[50:07] into the world and die and be our
[50:12] savior now we'll get back to that that's
[50:14] what I said this message tonight is
[50:16] running a borderline close on that part
[50:20] where you see mind in there that there a
[50:23] line in between right in the middle
[50:26] because we're going back on over closer
[50:28] to the predestinated
[50:33] seed and see what that is and how it
[50:36] falls and what it takes
[50:38] place but if we don't get this for
[50:40] knowledge correct that's
[50:44] right we won't be any difference than
[50:46] anybody
[50:47] else right but if we get four knowledge
[50:49] to the bases that God
[50:52] fornew then he could write a Bible
[50:55] before the world right amen but he
[50:58] didn't just write down Revelations on it
[51:00] 138 who whose names were not written in
[51:02] the L book of L for the foundation world
[51:05] is that the only scripture was written
[51:07] no the whole Bible was
[51:12] written that's how he could know Jacob
[51:14] how I love and Esau how I hate why
[51:17] because the whole Bible about what Jacob
[51:18] and Esau would do was written back
[51:22] there right we're just f
[51:26] fulfilling what was
[51:29] written we're just making manifest what
[51:32] was written before the world us sitting
[51:34] here tonight you sitting there listening
[51:35] to
[51:38] me is just a manifestation or of what
[51:41] you call it a materializing
[51:44] of what God saw before the
[51:49] world why can't we believe
[51:54] that well well it just don't make me
[51:56] feel good brother T that's what I said
[51:58] you ain't hit forn knowledge right
[52:00] yet if you don't feel good about forn
[52:03] knowledge to know that God looked down
[52:06] and saw amen that you would choose
[52:11] Amen to accept him as your
[52:16] savior if that don't put a thrill into
[52:18] your heart amen maybe you don't have
[52:24] one
[52:27] why would it say to the
[52:30] prophet because you've chosen this
[52:35] way a great portion of Heaven awaits you
[52:39] am now what if he hadn't chose
[52:43] it like I was saying the other day when
[52:45] he's riding down the road saying I'll
[52:46] just quit go back up the mountain be a
[52:48] prophet stom out give him a message go
[52:50] back God showed him a trist D burning y
[52:54] yep he said that's where you'll
[53:00] be he made a
[53:05] choice look like it'd be all right for
[53:07] him to go back and be a prophet and just
[53:09] come stomping out it would have been
[53:12] okay in the Old Testament cuz that's the
[53:14] way they
[53:18] done but a new testament Prophet can't
[53:21] do
[53:22] that a new testament prophet's got to
[53:25] live with the
[53:28] people
[53:31] right but you see what I'm talking
[53:34] about he had chosen Us in Jesus
[53:39] Christ before the foundation of the
[53:41] world
[53:42] Amen all right why because he was chosen
[53:47] that's right
[53:48] am that's
[53:53] right he was
[53:56] accepted and I was
[53:58] accepted if I have eternal
[54:03] life see now it's back in my
[54:09] lap why would it say choose you this day
[54:13] whom you will
[54:15] serve if you didn't have a
[54:20] choice he wouldn't say
[54:23] that he said go on and be happy and
[54:26] forget it if you happen to be you happen
[54:28] to
[54:32] be
[54:34] see he chose us in him
[54:44] right because he saw we would choose him
[54:48] down
[54:50] here why have we forgotten that part of
[54:54] predestination
[54:56] amen oh what everybody wants I've got
[54:58] the quotes if you want them L on my desk
[55:01] especially you never sought
[55:05] God God sought you
[55:08] right it makes me feel
[55:13] good there's that for knowledge I'm
[55:16] talking about
[55:21] am you said what is he talking about
[55:24] brother
[55:25] he said you never sought God no man
[55:27] sought God at any time that's exactly
[55:30] right when you was a sinner was you
[55:33] seeking
[55:35] God
[55:37] no no
[55:39] way but he was seeking you right
[55:43] amen right
[55:47] amen see we want to put it all well I
[55:50] don't have nothing to do with it now
[55:51] whatsoever because he sought me
[55:55] he picked me he chose me he accepted
[56:03] me and I'm on my way to
[56:08] heaven I wish it was that way
[56:14] right then if that would be true then
[56:18] the
[56:19] Rapture
[56:22] change would be some automatic process
[56:25] of time running
[56:31] out I drop little points every once in a
[56:34] while about what I'm thinking about and
[56:37] you might order to write them down other
[56:40] words when I come right in the middle of
[56:41] a predestination for knowledge thought
[56:43] and then start talking about the Rapture
[56:45] if I was you I'd pay close attention for
[56:47] a little bit and write it down I'm just
[56:49] telling
[56:53] you
[56:56] you see the Lord showed me what the
[56:57] Rapture was just a little glimpse of
[57:00] it that's what I'm
[57:03] preaching how about you own four
[57:07] knowledge if we don't get this right
[57:09] don't worry about it if we don't get our
[57:11] call in an election sure if we if we
[57:14] can't find out how we were chosen and
[57:17] how we was
[57:21] accepted you know that he was accepted
[57:24] to the father
[57:30] and when he was accepted I was accepted
[57:33] in
[57:34] him amen
[57:37] right I have our brother back here with
[57:40] us and see
[57:42] it chosen in
[57:47] him not by him choosing for his own
[57:51] desires or
[57:53] thoughts but because he knew knew what
[57:55] you'd
[57:56] want here's where we get so messed up in
[57:59] it though cuz I know the human thinking
[58:02] cuz that's the way I think
[58:04] okay we think
[58:06] uh Brother
[58:08] D I just don't understand when brother
[58:10] BR said that I never sought God because
[58:13] I prayed and cried and fasted
[58:17] and well that's
[58:21] good you know what that's what God was
[58:23] looking at
[58:25] MH
[58:27] right but it didn't make him save
[58:31] you no he'd already done
[58:34] it it didn't make him choose
[58:39] you he already chose
[58:44] you he chose you before the foundation
[58:46] of the world
[58:49] am cuz he knew you'd cry out and desire
[58:52] for God and brother BR said no man
[58:54] sought God God he's not doing away with
[58:57] praying and crying out and seeking the
[58:59] Lord well don't just he'll run me down
[59:02] if you ever wants me if he don't want me
[59:03] I just lost anyway you know well that's
[59:07] good is it that ain't even good
[59:11] Baptist
[59:14] yeah they did at least try to
[59:16] predetermine it to be
[59:18] something
[59:21] right but church are you following me
[59:28] an infinite God could look down through
[59:32] time and see every
[59:35] gnat that would ever come into the world
[59:38] and how many times that gnat would bat
[59:40] its eye and you mean to tell me that us
[59:44] peanut brain human beings is going to
[59:47] pull something over on
[59:53] him
[59:56] but you see we want to we take one thing
[59:58] we take it a wsid it well I didn't seek
[1:00:01] God God sought me that's
[1:00:03] good cuz when you as a sinner you never
[1:00:06] sought God I didn't
[1:00:13] either but one day he caught up with me
[1:00:16] amen thank you
[1:00:19] Lord and when he caught up with me there
[1:00:21] was just just enough of let me say if I
[1:00:24] can quot it right brother R said any
[1:00:26] person has ever come into the presence
[1:00:28] of an eternal being he said he'll never
[1:00:30] be right the rest of his
[1:00:32] life that's the best way to say it I
[1:00:34] guess they'd never be right the rest of
[1:00:36] his
[1:00:38] life let God cross a man's path and
[1:00:41] he'll never be no
[1:00:43] different I mean never be something that
[1:00:46] work he he just can't be the same no
[1:00:48] more
[1:00:51] right that's why I said you go into the
[1:00:55] four corners of the Africa and find a
[1:00:58] person that never heard of the name
[1:00:59] Jesus or talked about that way of God
[1:01:02] and he's worshiping an idol
[1:01:06] right and yet he's sometimes better off
[1:01:09] than we
[1:01:20] are but he accepted
[1:01:23] us and he had a
[1:01:25] reason let me get that
[1:01:28] point he had a
[1:01:35] reason why would he allow you and I to
[1:01:40] hear the end time
[1:01:42] message that's
[1:01:45] right why would he give us the new birth
[1:01:48] that's
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:57] why would it be that you and
[1:01:59] I could see things that the world can't
[1:02:03] see that's
[1:02:09] right I like the scriptures myself even
[1:02:12] like where it says blessed are they that
[1:02:14] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:02:16] the prophet said one day like this he
[1:02:19] said it's a blessing to hunger and
[1:02:21] thirst y amen you you know what a lot of
[1:02:25] people don't have it
[1:02:28] right but to have a desire in your heart
[1:02:31] to serve God is a wonderful opportunity
[1:02:40] amen but see we try to figure it all out
[1:02:43] is to try to find some form of something
[1:02:45] that makes us
[1:02:47] something that's always been man in his
[1:02:51] ways that's what causes denominations
[1:02:54] and and organizations and doctrines and
[1:03:00] ideas is people wanting to
[1:03:02] be greater than somebody
[1:03:05] else I got that first I first want to
[1:03:08] preached on
[1:03:14] that
[1:03:20] well he accepted
[1:03:23] us
[1:03:27] are we willing to lay down all of our
[1:03:29] thoughts and
[1:03:33] ideas and see that the great Eternal
[1:03:38] God had some reason for you and I
[1:03:43] am well I'm just a housewife I'm just a
[1:03:45] this I just you got your
[1:03:51] parten you got your part
[1:03:54] don't you just be your part amen why try
[1:03:57] to figure out to be something else yeah
[1:03:59] but I need to help God we don't need to
[1:04:01] help God right amen he called you to do
[1:04:04] something just go do
[1:04:07] it but if you don't never call you and
[1:04:09] tell you to do not just sit down and be
[1:04:11] so
[1:04:12] happy where was the Revival started back
[1:04:15] there in the ages one time you know by a
[1:04:17] lady on Wells Revival by Lady cleaning
[1:04:20] the
[1:04:21] pews and saying Lord bless that's this
[1:04:24] person that sits right
[1:04:28] here I started a a Revival that was one
[1:04:32] of the
[1:04:34] greatest of one
[1:04:37] person and don't you think that God
[1:04:40] before the world knew that
[1:04:44] right but you know what he was waiting
[1:04:48] on he was waiting on that
[1:04:51] lady he wasn't up in heaven
[1:04:55] he's waiting on that
[1:04:59] lady he's waiting on Martin Luther
[1:05:02] to run out of all of his thoughts and
[1:05:06] ideas and then he could cross his path
[1:05:08] and say that the just shall live by
[1:05:10] faith
[1:05:14] amen start a Reformation to the whole
[1:05:21] world well brother Dale do you believe
[1:05:23] Martin Lu was a predestinated
[1:05:27] seed I believe ever born again Christian
[1:05:29] is a predestinated
[1:05:31] seed that's the way I believe it I
[1:05:34] believe everybody that has eternal life
[1:05:37] is a predestinated seed amen that's the
[1:05:41] way I believe
[1:05:44] it no but there's some predestinated is
[1:05:46] something what are you trying to work it
[1:05:48] out with
[1:05:50] yeah
[1:05:52] you why I just be happy
[1:05:58] say thank you
[1:06:01] Lord let me just do what you want me to
[1:06:03] do
[1:06:04] Lord I'll get my job
[1:06:11] done
[1:06:13] accepted in the
[1:06:17] Beloved
[1:06:20] elected by for knowledge
[1:06:24] we think boy election's got to do with
[1:06:26] something you know elected by his for
[1:06:33] knowledge that way it's not God choosing
[1:06:36] one and rejecting the other
[1:06:39] right it's us choosing what we will do
[1:06:43] that's right but yet God already knew
[1:06:46] that if he if he's God if not let's
[1:06:48] forget
[1:06:49] it he knew before the world what we
[1:06:52] would choose that's right
[1:06:55] he never brought this message down in
[1:06:57] the ages V
[1:06:59] right they couldn't handle
[1:07:04] it you think a man like Martin Luther
[1:07:07] great man come out there a great
[1:07:08] wonderful
[1:07:10] man yet he was still a
[1:07:13] trinitarian he said all the Jews were to
[1:07:15] be T and
[1:07:19] killed but you know God didn't fuss with
[1:07:22] him about that right
[1:07:27] he never jerked him up and send him to
[1:07:29] hell because of some thought he had
[1:07:33] right cuz he knew down in that man's
[1:07:36] heart was ringing out a
[1:07:39] thought that just shall live by faith
[1:07:48] Amen Let Me end it up by just saying
[1:07:52] this
[1:07:55] could your desires or your thoughts
[1:08:00] tonight be what God is working
[1:08:05] on
[1:08:13] right see I think one of these days
[1:08:15] somebody's going to catch it we're going
[1:08:16] to walk off this
[1:08:18] Earth You know I believe that amen un
[1:08:23] likee brother MO I always like the way
[1:08:24] he Illustrated it he said when you're
[1:08:27] climbing up a ladder said just take one
[1:08:29] rung at a time right he said don't back
[1:08:33] up and run towards the ladder and try to
[1:08:36] jump up on
[1:08:38] it he said just take one step at a
[1:08:43] time I said that's right
[1:08:48] Lord let me just step out as he reveals
[1:08:51] it right
[1:08:52] amen but I believe that
[1:08:56] somebody is going to come to a
[1:08:59] place until they're going to
[1:09:03] see not the
[1:09:05] past and not the
[1:09:08] future that's right but they going to
[1:09:11] see what's going on
[1:09:13] now that's
[1:09:16] right why would we worry about the
[1:09:19] future we're not there
[1:09:22] yet it'll take care of
[1:09:25] itself we're not
[1:09:29] there but if we're not here in present
[1:09:32] tense and get this right what does it
[1:09:34] matter if we step into another
[1:09:38] day do you realize how simple I'm trying
[1:09:41] to
[1:09:43] say the whole world was in Mass
[1:09:47] confusion and one man
[1:09:51] said the just shall live by faith that's
[1:09:55] right turn the whole world upside down
[1:10:03] amen one man has already brought us the
[1:10:05] message in the end
[1:10:10] time but that man was not capable of
[1:10:13] fulfilling all the
[1:10:18] things and he never preached it as he
[1:10:21] was capable or was called to do it right
[1:10:25] right he gave us the scriptures and gave
[1:10:28] us the thoughts the five full Ministries
[1:10:30] for the perfecting of the
[1:10:32] Saints that's according to the Bible and
[1:10:34] according to the
[1:10:35] prophet and we want to say the prophet
[1:10:37] is f where's the scripture where's the
[1:10:39] quote I want it right if you bring it to
[1:10:42] me I'll say I won't never preach again
[1:10:44] that's
[1:10:45] right no problem with me Butz I know you
[1:10:48] can't find
[1:10:52] it they said that ain't going to change
[1:10:54] nobody that believes it that
[1:10:59] way but all it's going to do is give
[1:11:01] hopes to those that
[1:11:04] are maybe not knowing exactly where
[1:11:07] they're
[1:11:12] at and saying Lord show me what's going
[1:11:19] on show me what's going on
[1:11:22] Lord and my part of
[1:11:27] it what I can
[1:11:36] do church I I've always just been one
[1:11:39] that tried to do one thing I've always
[1:11:40] tried to is just to take the Bible and
[1:11:44] believe
[1:11:47] it I believe there was had to be a man
[1:11:50] I'll get back to this one of these days
[1:11:52] they had to be a man man come into the
[1:11:56] world because the Bible
[1:11:59] said there'd be a voice of one crying in
[1:12:02] the
[1:12:05] wilderness that man came
[1:12:08] and from his youth he was
[1:12:12] trained and one day God told him he said
[1:12:14] go on out I got your job ready for you
[1:12:16] now you're going to introduce the
[1:12:19] Messiah John the Baptist stood out there
[1:12:22] and the whole World against
[1:12:25] him and said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:12:28] takes away the sin of the world y that's
[1:12:31] right he didn't care who was against him
[1:12:33] that's
[1:12:37] right was it was a simple
[1:12:42] message I believe the Rapture is the
[1:12:44] same
[1:12:46] way somebody is going
[1:12:48] to walk right into
[1:12:52] it and it's not a positive thinking
[1:12:55] point right but yet we've got to be
[1:12:57] positive we're not positive we're
[1:12:59] negative anyway so but it's not a
[1:13:02] positive of somebody just said okay now
[1:13:04] what we going to do here everybody in
[1:13:06] the church now what I want everybody to
[1:13:07] do now I want you to 14 times a day to
[1:13:11] say or 10 million times be better to
[1:13:15] say I'm already
[1:13:20] redeemed that probably make us all
[1:13:22] happier
[1:13:24] and we wouldn't be so down and out at
[1:13:26] the mouth you know so
[1:13:30] sad but that wouldn't do what I'm
[1:13:32] talking
[1:13:40] about God chose
[1:13:44] somebody to bring the message in the end
[1:13:46] time that's
[1:13:48] right amen I believe that message amen
[1:13:52] sir
[1:13:54] now he's chose you and I Amen to make
[1:13:57] that message
[1:13:59] alive why would a prophet himself say
[1:14:03] the bride of Christ is to vindicate you
[1:14:05] on the Internet run it
[1:14:08] NC he said the bride of Christ would
[1:14:11] vindicate melachi 4 Luke 17:30
[1:14:15] Revelations 10:7 that's right he said
[1:14:18] well God's already Vindicated that well
[1:14:21] why did he say the bride would vindicate
[1:14:23] it that's right
[1:14:27] amen see we got a job to
[1:14:34] do get all of our ducks in a row as we
[1:14:37] call it and start walking in the line
[1:14:40] maybe we can find
[1:14:42] it I believe it'll be a very simple
[1:14:45] message
[1:14:47] right right but it won't be with just
[1:14:50] one preacher preaching it that's right
[1:14:53] I've never believed that we had one
[1:14:56] Prophet we don't need anymore no but we
[1:14:59] need a five-fold Ministry that's right
[1:15:02] around the world then we need a bride a
[1:15:05] group of people to make aive what that
[1:15:07] Ministry is saying that's right that's
[1:15:13] right I believe in
[1:15:18] it see that way we all then got aart
[1:15:22] come on brother that's right amen we got
[1:15:26] aart had a lot of quotes about Chosen
[1:15:29] and what it was if you can't believe
[1:15:31] that we were chosen in him before the
[1:15:33] foundation of world all the scriptures
[1:15:35] has been read and what I've said and
[1:15:37] what the prophet has said and what all
[1:15:39] has been said then you're not going to
[1:15:42] believe it
[1:15:46] anyway but just remember what I started
[1:15:48] off
[1:15:49] with it's not whether or not I'm chosen
[1:15:52] that I'm trying to to figure
[1:15:55] out if I can take the word and prove he
[1:15:59] was chosen
[1:16:05] right and all I got to do is make sure
[1:16:08] I'm in him
[1:16:11] amen it's not whether or not I'm
[1:16:15] accepted it's whether or not he was
[1:16:19] accepted if I can believe he was
[1:16:22] accepted
[1:16:24] and I know I was accepted in
[1:16:27] him very
[1:16:31] simple maybe sometimes it's too
[1:16:34] simple because people lik this great
[1:16:37] things that makes it look so beautiful
[1:16:39] and you
[1:16:41] know great swelling
[1:16:45] words but all I'm trying to do is get
[1:16:48] you to see Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ and he died to take my
[1:16:55] place all he wants is me to die to let
[1:16:58] him live that's the whole story the
[1:17:01] Christian Life
[1:17:04] right so it's not whether or not you're
[1:17:06] and I worth
[1:17:09] anything my whole dependen is in whether
[1:17:11] he was
[1:17:16] worthy go ahead brother let's Stand
[1:17:19] Together sing number 612 in the spal
[1:17:21] book as a dear p
[1:17:28] de
[1:17:36] the you
[1:17:41] alone what about it
[1:17:44] church do you believe he was
[1:17:47] chosen I don't have any trouble
[1:17:51] you I don't have any problem
[1:17:53] beleving he was
[1:17:57] chosen but I know he was
[1:18:00] worthy you are and all I got to do is
[1:18:06] make sure that same life that was in him
[1:18:09] is in
[1:18:12] me you are my and you are my brother
[1:18:18] even though you are my king
[1:18:38] whatever let's just
[1:18:41] believe let's believe and say thank you
[1:18:45] Lord all be taken care of
[1:18:49] Father we lay our hands upon our brother
[1:18:51] believe in one thing
[1:18:54] the same
[1:18:56] God you saw before the foundation of the
[1:19:00] world as you being God and seeing all
[1:19:03] things saw that Jesus Christ would stand
[1:19:07] as a lamb
[1:19:09] slain but not only that he'd be the
[1:19:12] healer the Redeemer and we believe you
[1:19:15] Lord we lay our hands here and
[1:19:18] believing all the group together we
