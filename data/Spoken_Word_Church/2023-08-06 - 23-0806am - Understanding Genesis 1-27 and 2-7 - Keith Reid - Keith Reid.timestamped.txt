[22:41] I want to see you
[22:48] amen
[22:50] praise the Lord
[22:52] amen we want to certainly thank God for
[22:54] this privilege of being in the house
[22:57] amen with Jamaica with a morning family
[23:02] amen we greet the family of God Amen and
[23:07] we're certainly glad to be here we're
[23:09] certainly glad for the hospitality that
[23:13] we've received each time we are here and
[23:16] not only that but it seems like my
[23:19] family is a part of your family amen
[23:22] it's a few places that I've gone to
[23:24] where I know most of the people and most
[23:27] persons who know me and so I'm no
[23:30] stranger to you amen as a I
[23:34] say this and I say this everywhere that
[23:36] this is a place where my early Christian
[23:39] life and my life as a pastor and a
[23:42] preacher I was taught
[23:45] the message of the hour amen where I can
[23:49] extend that
[23:51] um Wherever I Go
[23:53] and you know I thank God that um I've
[23:56] taken that gospel of Christ and the
[23:59] message of the hour you know I've been
[24:01] to South Africa Zimbabwe I've been to
[24:04] Zambia Nigeria I've been to Ghana I've
[24:07] been to Liberia Sierra Leone I've been
[24:10] to Kenya and Uganda amen amen
[24:18] by God's grace amen by the grace of God
[24:21] Amen praise God so we could tell you
[24:24] many things that has happened in the
[24:26] field and back home and wherever we go
[24:30] but we certainly thank God for his grace
[24:32] and his mercies towards us and like our
[24:35] Prophet says that no church
[24:38] no matter what it's practice it's a no
[24:43] matter intellectual or fundamental you
[24:45] want to be he said that church cannot
[24:48] strive until the Supernatural is made
[24:52] known among the people and it's
[24:55] something that you can talk to that can
[24:58] talk back to you so I said when the
[25:00] supernatural becomes natural in your
[25:03] midst amen then you know it's the
[25:05] maturing of the sons of God Amen praise
[25:08] God so amen very simple things we speak
[25:12] um the greatest thing that we can do is
[25:15] to take the word of God
[25:18] um by the light that the message has
[25:20] shown on the word and break it to the
[25:23] people so that our children can
[25:25] understand it you know if we say we
[25:27] preach a mystery and we think we've got
[25:30] a revelation of that and the younger
[25:33] ones can't understand it then the
[25:35] Mysteries us in our head amen but uh
[25:39] Rebecca had to know for certain
[25:43] exactly how Isaac is or else when she
[25:46] seem in the field she would have thought
[25:48] she had seen a stranger amen but he's
[25:51] not a stranger to us today we know
[25:54] exactly who he is
[25:55] and the only way you can truly know who
[25:58] you are is the first know who he is amen
[26:02] because you're a reflection
[26:04] of who he is amen so we're going to go
[26:08] to the scriptures this morning
[26:10] like to have my wife and um you know I
[26:13] greet you also from the children
[26:15] or you know where empty nesters you know
[26:18] our children live now in Canada
[26:21] and um
[26:23] but you know because of the way
[26:25] Technologies today we've not missed each
[26:28] other we see each other we talk to each
[26:29] other many times for the day
[26:31] amen and so so we thank God for that
[26:34] experience amen
[26:36] so we want to turn to uh the Book of
[26:39] Genesis the C chapter
[26:41] um Genesis chapter one
[26:43] and I'll read verse 26 and 27
[26:47] and then we will move from there but let
[26:49] us bow our heads and talk to the author
[26:52] of the word amen
[26:55] our great God and Father when I thank
[26:57] you God for this privilege that you have
[26:59] given to given to us to be in your house
[27:01] and Lord God every time the doors are
[27:04] open it's not the building of God that
[27:07] is sacred but Lord God it is you in our
[27:10] lives
[27:10] that has transformed us oh God by Your
[27:13] Word
[27:14] Heavenly Father we pray that oh God will
[27:17] preach things oh God naturally among the
[27:20] people the Lord God they might see Jesus
[27:22] Christ this morning Lord remember those
[27:25] that are sick and Afflicted those that
[27:29] are without you this morning
[27:30] Lord God wherever the bride of Christ
[27:33] are gathered Lord God in your name we
[27:35] pray that you've been there midst this
[27:37] morning to feed the flock of God with
[27:39] the word of God and Father we thank you
[27:42] God to help us to move ourselves out of
[27:45] the way that you can be glorified today
[27:48] have your own way as we thank and
[27:51] believe you in Jesus Christ's name we
[27:53] pray amen
[27:55] and amen so in Genesis 1
[27:59] 26 you know it very well
[28:02] you could recite it
[28:04] and God said let us make man in our
[28:07] image
[28:08] and after all likeness
[28:12] and let them have dominion
[28:15] of the fish of the sea I want you to
[28:17] notice that he said and let them
[28:20] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[28:23] and over the fowl of the year and over
[28:26] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[28:29] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[28:31] upon the Earth
[28:34] so God created man
[28:37] in his own image
[28:40] in the image of God created he him
[28:44] male and female created e them may the
[28:50] Lord had his Blessing to the word this
[28:53] morning you may be seated
[28:58] you know this is my third week here this
[29:01] morning
[29:02] and um you know I had to come before
[29:05] because
[29:07] we have you know just a little business
[29:09] that we do back home and others are
[29:12] depending on us so I had to
[29:14] leave Francine and my Kim on the 14th
[29:18] and she came to
[29:22] weeks after then when we leave here
[29:25] God's willing I'm going back home
[29:27] and she'll be going to see the girls
[29:29] you know in Canada
[29:31] but you know um she she had a ticket to
[29:34] come fly out of Montego Bay and um
[29:37] you know just share a little testimony
[29:39] with you
[29:40] and um we know there's a bus that travel
[29:44] out of Kingston maybe five times a day
[29:48] you know you have different ones going
[29:50] all the way to the airport so going to
[29:52] the airport now from linstead which for
[29:55] for us driving would have been just
[29:57] about two and a half hours really
[29:59] but now it costs the so small for you to
[30:03] take the bus and to go to the airport
[30:05] very convenient
[30:08] so uh I was trying to buy her ticket on
[30:12] the bus you know online to but the
[30:14] website was going all over the place and
[30:16] I didn't get a chance to do it so
[30:19] um Monday morning when she was supposed
[30:20] to
[30:22] um fly out Monday in the day she had I
[30:24] think one after some a flight after one
[30:27] o'clock so she had to be on the bus at 6
[30:29] 30 leaving Spanish town so I might call
[30:33] her to see if she was up and she was up
[30:36] so I said remember you got to get there
[30:38] early because you don't have a ticket
[30:39] you got to go to get a ticket but
[30:41] something said but why don't you go and
[30:43] check now if you can actually get the
[30:45] ticket
[30:45] and when I went on the side of the bus
[30:48] you know it showed me that there's no
[30:51] seat left on the bus oh my goodness so I
[30:54] I looked then that was a 6 30 bus I look
[30:56] at the the eight o'clock bus and there's
[30:59] no seat
[31:00] I look at the 12 o'clock bus and there's
[31:03] no seat
[31:04] so I the only seat was available two
[31:06] seats available on the 530 bus now or
[31:09] our flight is just after one o'clock
[31:13] so I said oh my Lord what will I do now
[31:15] so I called her and tell her I said Hey
[31:17] listen we've got to get somebody to take
[31:19] you to the airport you know and so you
[31:22] know this is the last minute really that
[31:25] we're going to go and um you know so she
[31:28] was calling the sister that was supposed
[31:30] to just take her 20 minutes into Spanish
[31:32] Town really to get the bus and so and to
[31:36] make new Arrangements but something said
[31:38] to me I mean pray
[31:40] and so I was going on my knees at the
[31:43] side of the bed to pray and you know you
[31:46] you have a notification in your phone
[31:48] and I hear it so I look and when I look
[31:50] somebody had sent me a text and it says
[31:53] so it was a scripture but then then it
[31:56] says but God
[31:57] but God and I went down and I prayed and
[32:01] I said but God you are rich in Mercy and
[32:05] you give to us exactly what we have need
[32:07] of and I just feel that assurance that
[32:10] everything is going to be all right
[32:12] and I got back up and I walked around I
[32:15] said well let me check again
[32:17] and I went back on the bus I went in and
[32:20] when I checked there was two seats there
[32:23] so I bought one
[32:27] amen
[32:28] you know we serve a God who uh make the
[32:32] impossible possible
[32:34] no I don't know if somebody dropped out
[32:36] or but that's not my business
[32:39] I only know that what I asked him for he
[32:42] gives it to me amen praise God so I call
[32:45] her back and says well that's all right
[32:47] you can take your time because you've
[32:49] got a confirmed seat on the bus amen
[32:52] praise God
[32:53] Hallelujah now we want to look at the
[32:56] word here that we've read
[33:00] in Genesis 1 26 and I'll go to Genesis 2
[33:04] 7 in a little while and I continue this
[33:07] afternoon to look at his condescending
[33:09] you know it says God created man in his
[33:13] own image
[33:14] in the image of God created in him male
[33:18] and female created them
[33:20] no God created
[33:23] not a man
[33:26] because sometimes we want to think that
[33:28] God created Adam no but God created man
[33:32] the whole man now this was the thought
[33:36] the expression of God that in the mind
[33:40] of God I want to be a father so I'm
[33:43] going to create man
[33:45] so when God has that thought that
[33:47] thought of God is eternal so God did not
[33:51] create just Adam but he created every
[33:55] redeemed human being was in The Talks Of
[33:59] God Amen and if that is not so then when
[34:03] we get over to predestination then we
[34:06] can't find ourselves if we can't find it
[34:08] back in the thought of God
[34:10] so we were in the mind of God before the
[34:13] world began so don't think that the
[34:16] scripture referred to only one man no
[34:19] but it refers to the whole redeem
[34:23] creation Now in the message demon
[34:26] knowledge in 1953 amen here brother
[34:29] Branham now putting that into
[34:31] perspective he said but your soul was
[34:34] made up before the foundation of the
[34:37] world when God created man in his own
[34:40] image Hallelujah so you didn't come
[34:45] afterwards amen I was spoken in the mind
[34:49] of God the same time that Adam came it
[34:53] isn't right so there is a part of me if
[34:57] I've got a new birth that is eternal in
[35:00] God Amen that in the beginning God when
[35:05] he said I want man I I need somebody to
[35:09] worship me you are part of that
[35:12] is that right Amen in his own image but
[35:15] man in his own image see and then he
[35:19] made male and female before he ever had
[35:23] a man in the dust of the earth amen then
[35:27] over requested an answer 1962 he said no
[35:30] no notice in Genesis again 1 26 God
[35:35] created the whales of the sea he'd done
[35:38] everything and made the creation made
[35:41] man in his own image made man not a man
[35:46] the whole man hallelujah amen all of
[35:51] them in his old image see and after the
[35:55] image of God created even yeah male and
[35:59] female created him but like that amen so
[36:04] we noticed then that now where are you
[36:07] in the beginning
[36:09] Hallelujah that day when God created man
[36:13] in his own image
[36:15] my expression from God was also created
[36:20] it's not only Adam because we think that
[36:23] he created Adam and then from Genesis 1
[36:27] 26 then he go to Genesis 2 7 with Adam
[36:30] but no you see in Genesis 2 7 he brought
[36:35] Adam from the start
[36:38] into expression
[36:40] amen hallelujah but where were you you
[36:45] were there
[36:46] hallelujah praise God so Jerry says no
[36:50] he said but then Genesis 2 7 Adam was
[36:54] first expressed it was formed taught of
[36:57] God hallelujah that's what he was
[36:59] hallelujah amen physical tangible from
[37:04] the pool Gene let us says from the the
[37:08] pool of thought that God have asked man
[37:12] from Genesis 1 26 27 amen so now he's
[37:17] carrying on his creation but at first
[37:21] that that first creation of man let us
[37:24] say but I was a part of it amen
[37:28] so when I say I'm a part of my savior I
[37:31] didn't come when I when I come from my
[37:33] mother and father
[37:35] I didn't come when I hear the word of
[37:37] God when God said let us make man in our
[37:40] image amen I was in the image of God not
[37:44] you the person
[37:46] not you the person but that Gene of God
[37:49] Amen that you will carry from the New
[37:53] Birth hey man you were already there
[37:56] Hallelujah so the exposition of the
[37:58] Southern church changes said in very
[38:00] plain language the true bride of Christ
[38:03] was in the in the mind of God eternally
[38:06] so if you're in the mind of God
[38:10] eternally
[38:11] you never had a beginning there
[38:14] and you'll never added hand you're
[38:17] always there
[38:18] Hallelujah do not express until each
[38:22] comfort in the designated Hallelujah
[38:26] decreed season amen
[38:29] as each member came forth it become
[38:32] expressed and took its place in the body
[38:36] thus this bride is eternal spoken word
[38:41] seed bride hallelujah amen and though as
[38:45] she is feminine in designation she is
[38:48] also called the body of Christ
[38:52] amen so we're looking now where we were
[38:55] before
[38:57] hallelujah amen let us continue to bring
[39:00] it amen but you see we were there before
[39:02] God wanted it so amen but the rest of
[39:07] his attribute taught children should be
[39:09] expressed
[39:11] without the sexed act before that came
[39:15] in you were there
[39:17] but by creation of the spoken word until
[39:20] Genesis 3 when the fall is a rot amen
[39:24] then everything is going to be spoken of
[39:26] it is that right but you are before the
[39:29] fall
[39:30] amen you were before the fall amen said
[39:34] Romans 3 23 the Bible says for all have
[39:37] sinned and come short of the glory of
[39:40] God now amen in that expression amen
[39:44] Paul was really expressing something
[39:46] that was before he was now speaking of
[39:49] Genesis 3.
[39:51] but the bride does not come because of
[39:54] Genesis 3 you came in Genesis 1 27.
[40:00] Hallelujah so you said well but I'm
[40:04] bound
[40:05] because I was born in sin and shaped in
[40:07] iniquity you see that's what the devil
[40:10] tells you but what does God say to you
[40:13] I brought you before that is that right
[40:16] you were before that amen then First
[40:20] Peter 1 23 being born again yes
[40:24] not a corruptible seed
[40:26] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[40:30] which light and abideth forever now when
[40:35] the fall came amen you could not come
[40:38] forth by the way Adam come amen and Adam
[40:42] was a Son of God in the Old Testament he
[40:45] never he came before The Fall Adam was
[40:49] before the fall amen
[40:52] the life of God in you was before the
[40:56] father
[40:56] amen but this man this is an unbeliever
[41:01] because he came in the fall you see so
[41:06] your life today is depict by who is
[41:09] leading you
[41:10] if you're being led by this man then
[41:13] you're an unbeliever and even if amen
[41:17] there's a gene that speak of you in the
[41:20] mind of God if you're out of your
[41:23] position you're in this man
[41:26] there's only one way to read the benefit
[41:29] of your eternal life you're going to
[41:31] step out of the flesh
[41:33] the Bible says he that is in the flesh
[41:35] cannot please God nor indeed can be so
[41:40] you cannot stand outside of your
[41:42] position and said well you know I'm
[41:45] predestinated seed of God and I will not
[41:48] be lost you're going to be lost
[41:51] if you're in a bachelor condition you're
[41:54] lost is that wrong but when you're in
[41:57] your position you can speak like God
[42:00] Speak
[42:01] but if you're out of your position amen
[42:05] and that is why we need the washing of
[42:08] the Water by the word
[42:10] hey don't let nobody fool you if this
[42:13] word don't wash you
[42:15] amen you'll never stand in position
[42:20] amen Moses had left them for 40
[42:27] see they cross the Red Sea and when they
[42:31] cross the Red Sea what a jubilee they
[42:32] had Miriam took the tambourine and him
[42:35] and they're singing the dancing holy
[42:37] dance all right amen but but Moses
[42:41] though went upon the mountain to seal
[42:45] what God has given to them
[42:47] Hallelujah and the people begin to look
[42:50] for something else
[42:51] just a few days without the washing of
[42:55] the prophet and they begin to start to
[42:58] look for something else that you know
[43:00] what they did
[43:01] they took I idolatry went to the camp
[43:04] they began to take all their hearings
[43:06] and their chains and their their braces
[43:09] is that what the Bible said
[43:12] and they melt them into a golden calf
[43:15] and Iran
[43:16] said be all your God that take you out
[43:18] of Egypt
[43:19] why oh quickly they went there because
[43:22] the prophet
[43:24] was missing from their Mitch and they
[43:27] weren't being Washed by the prophet so
[43:30] now they begin to dance the the same
[43:32] people that a few days back dancing holy
[43:37] dance they now begin to dance a devilish
[43:40] dance
[43:43] see where you're going to be dancing to
[43:46] the right thing amen
[43:49] Hallelujah and I want to say to you you
[43:52] see people say well you know it's all
[43:54] right Hallelujah if we put them back and
[43:57] and all they listen because of the
[43:59] spirit of idolatry when we took them off
[44:02] we never put them back
[44:04] hello
[44:06] hello
[44:07] and anytime you see they start coming
[44:10] back into the house of God idolatry is
[44:12] also coming back amen
[44:15] you might not like that but that's the
[44:17] truth amen
[44:20] Hallelujah amen
[44:23] praise God
[44:24] now
[44:26] a dead incense somebody was dead in sin
[44:29] well they said we're born in sin and we
[44:33] are certainly so we are formed in sin
[44:36] because
[44:38] the the human desire was involved
[44:41] Hallelujah so therefore you're
[44:44] annihilated from God
[44:47] amen and a man that's dying is sin is
[44:51] annihilated from God according to
[44:53] Ezekiel that's what the Bible said if
[44:56] such a one is originally Hallelujah an
[44:58] attribute taught of God in Genesis 1 27
[45:01] that God created the whole man
[45:04] Hallelujah and a part of God's thought
[45:07] is dead
[45:10] but the thoughts of God is eternal amen
[45:14] hallelujah and so no matter what the
[45:17] devil does on this side he cannot stop
[45:20] the plan of God in your life
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:26] what the bride of Christ ought to do is
[45:28] to stand in your predestinated position
[45:31] the word of God hallelujah no people say
[45:36] today well you know we put the message
[45:38] aside we put the prophet's voice aside
[45:41] or we call it the voice of God and we're
[45:43] going back to our Bible but we have the
[45:46] Bible for all these years and we didn't
[45:48] even know what was there it was right
[45:50] there written on the pages but there was
[45:52] no light
[45:55] Hallelujah
[45:56] and so this one said this means this and
[45:59] this one said that means that you know
[46:01] why because they're all in darkness but
[46:04] the light shine that you no longer
[46:06] presuming you know exactly what is there
[46:10] amen hallelujah glory and blasphemous
[46:15] names paragraph 185.
[46:18] he said now
[46:20] they take the scriptures from back
[46:24] and God breathe the breath into the
[46:28] nostril and he become a living Soul now
[46:32] I want to ask you something
[46:34] if he was a man
[46:36] what kind of breath was he breathing
[46:40] before God breathed his breath of life
[46:43] into him
[46:45] what kind of breath he was a breathing
[46:48] living man well then if that be so then
[46:53] every animal is a living soul
[46:58] amen
[46:59] and the Breath of God brings the new
[47:01] birth you hold that amen so cause they
[47:07] breathe hallelujah amen a human soul or
[47:10] human soul and all together that Jesus
[47:13] wouldn't have had to Die the animal
[47:16] sacrifice him it would have been
[47:19] sufficient
[47:20] so brother the argument don't stand
[47:24] Hallelujah you must be born again
[47:27] Hallelujah but what good did the breath
[47:32] that breathe of Eternal that breath of
[47:34] eternal life amen then you become a
[47:37] living soul
[47:39] a soul that can't die
[47:42] now watch now we're going to get into
[47:45] honey Plum tour of hell but he said
[47:48] notice breath he said breathe the breath
[47:53] of eternal life into his nostril and he
[47:56] become a living Soul because God's
[48:00] breath not what nature done but what God
[48:03] did breathe the breath of life amen into
[48:07] this nostril and he become a living Soul
[48:12] amen hallelujah no we're looking at that
[48:16] portion we want to move into another
[48:19] Direction now now the question is
[48:23] when God said let us make man in our
[48:27] image in Genesis 1 26. who was he
[48:30] talking to
[48:33] amen
[48:34] who was he talking to now let us look at
[48:37] Genesis 1 26 again and God said let us
[48:40] make man in our own image
[48:43] after likeness and let them have
[48:47] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[48:49] over the fowl of the year and over the
[48:52] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[48:55] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[48:57] the Earth
[48:58] Hallelujah God is one
[49:02] and as many titles or attribute is that
[49:06] right to express himself hallelujah amen
[49:10] at any point in time God expressed
[49:12] himself by his attribute amen so it's
[49:16] either it's title his office is
[49:19] attribute whatever we want to call it
[49:20] but his father his son and he is the
[49:25] Holy Ghost are you with me and has
[49:28] always been the same person all the time
[49:32] there is one God hallelujah and none
[49:35] else so in Ephesians 4 and verse 6 he
[49:38] said one God and Father of all
[49:43] who is above all father
[49:45] and through all the son and in you all
[49:49] the Holy Spirit
[49:51] amen
[49:53] hallelujah Glory it literally it really
[49:57] depends on your viewpoint
[50:00] on how you see the scripture now in
[50:03] Isaiah 45 and verse 22 the Bible says
[50:07] look unto me and be saved
[50:10] all the ends of the Earth for I am God
[50:14] and there is none else
[50:17] look unto me and be saved
[50:21] he said for I am God
[50:25] therefore it's projecting God as your
[50:28] savior
[50:29] Hallelujah and he said and if I am your
[50:32] savior there's none else
[50:35] hallelujah amen so in the message Look
[50:38] Away to Jesus paragraph 216. he said so
[50:42] many of you that claim to have the Holy
[50:45] Ghost look and see the second person of
[50:48] a trinity
[50:50] claiming to have the Holy Ghost
[50:53] but you're looking at yourself I see the
[50:56] second person of the trinity
[50:58] amen when it's not even mentioned in the
[51:02] Bible
[51:03] there is no such a thing the word
[51:06] Trinity is not even in the Bible
[51:08] but yet when you look at Jesus you
[51:12] regard him as the the third person or
[51:16] the second person of a trinity and
[51:19] that's the reason you don't get anywhere
[51:22] yeah
[51:23] in paragraph one two one seven he said
[51:26] you know what he said I am God
[51:29] and there is none other beside me
[51:33] in other words when I stand there's none
[51:35] beside me there there there there is one
[51:38] God
[51:39] amen but we've got to look now at his
[51:42] expression
[51:43] amen we've got to get it there
[51:46] hallelujah amen he said no so it depends
[51:50] on what you're looking at if you want to
[51:53] put some little mascot boy
[51:56] an old man with beard and so forth if
[51:59] that's the way you look at Jesus as
[52:02] being some different person from God you
[52:05] are looking wrong
[52:06] you don't see it
[52:08] and if you will focus your mind to God's
[52:12] word there's only one way we can get it
[52:15] not by theology to God's word
[52:18] the tree will be one see but your
[52:21] ecclesiastical glasses get out of focus
[52:25] when you try to make him three and not
[52:29] one
[52:30] the question is who was he talking to
[52:35] I wanted to build that in mind amen
[52:39] Look Away to Jesus paragraph two to two
[52:42] but it depends on what
[52:44] you are looking at
[52:46] what do you see when you do look
[52:49] remember you can only see him as you
[52:54] look at him through the word where is he
[52:58] through the word amen
[53:01] hallelujah you can't look at him through
[53:04] a textbook
[53:05] you can't look at him to a Creed
[53:08] Hallelujah you will how you will see two
[53:11] or three gods are everything else in
[53:14] them Creed but look at him through the
[53:17] word and you'll see that he is Emmanuel
[53:21] God made flesh Among Us he said I am God
[53:26] and beside me there is none other he is
[53:30] God
[53:32] one God Amen Hallelujah so Genesis 1 1
[53:37] says in the beginning
[53:39] God
[53:41] created the Heaven and the Earth one God
[53:46] Amen hey I tell you this thank God he
[53:50] sent us in this hour
[53:54] have you ever think where you would be
[53:56] if God never sent us a voice
[53:59] in this hour
[54:01] we would be there in the robe choir
[54:03] singing
[54:04] God and three persons Blessed Trinity
[54:08] that's where we would have been but God
[54:11] sent us a voice we would be back there
[54:14] in Pentecost preaching
[54:17] a god like your finger
[54:19] amen Hallelujah Glory
[54:23] but let us look now the word God was
[54:26] translated from the Hebrew word Elohim
[54:29] meaning
[54:30] self-existing one you all know that
[54:33] hallelujah amen all dwelling all by
[54:36] himself that was what he was way before
[54:39] the creation of all things even man
[54:42] in the abducted adoption
[54:46] 605-15e paragraph 99 he said let me
[54:50] before we go any further
[54:53] go back to Genesis 1 26.
[54:56] when God made man before he made man he
[55:00] called himself
[55:03] [Music]
[55:04] hello him the word means in Hebrew the
[55:09] self-existing one
[55:11] all by himself nothing exists before him
[55:17] he was all the existence there were
[55:20] there ever was self-existing one
[55:23] well Ella Elohim means all sufficient
[55:28] all-powerful mighty self-existing one
[55:32] Hallelujah so we said then before God
[55:37] was God
[55:40] there's no textbooks that ever say that
[55:44] amen no Theologian ever expressed that
[55:47] but a prophet says before God was gone
[55:52] amen hallelujah when he was Elohim but
[55:57] before the beginning
[55:59] that was before the beginning Hallelujah
[56:03] Elohim
[56:05] unit plural one
[56:09] Hallelujah but an expression yes
[56:12] hallelujah amen amen this does not it's
[56:16] not simply plural no no it's one God
[56:21] hallelujah amen we're coming down to his
[56:24] name also so adoption 107 he said e by
[56:28] for knowledge
[56:30] foresee us knowing that he was a savior
[56:34] Hallelujah yet he's self-existing amen
[56:38] but he knows he's a savior because
[56:41] enemies are truth or knowledge
[56:44] omnipotence hallelujah amen
[56:49] yes there was no angel no nothing just
[56:53] God hello himself existing one nothing
[56:56] but him alone but in him was a savior
[57:00] well what's he going to save all of you
[57:04] we're coming down now there's nothing
[57:06] lost
[57:07] amen knowing that he knew what this
[57:13] great attribute in him would would
[57:15] project something about Yonder that he
[57:19] could save he knew that
[57:22] so he knows that you would be right here
[57:24] this morning
[57:27] amen God
[57:31] Hallelujah
[57:33] and this thing you're praying for in
[57:35] your mind right now he has already given
[57:38] the answer
[57:41] that's the kind of God we serve
[57:44] oh my
[57:47] God hallelujah
[57:49] that here now
[57:51] we are finite
[57:53] but he's in for night
[57:55] is it right
[57:57] Hallelujah and let me just say this real
[57:59] quickly and
[58:01] he gives us a theophany second
[58:05] Corinthians 5 1. if I hurtly I was in
[58:08] the stubborn I can be dissolved we've
[58:10] got an Assembly of God high up in the
[58:11] heavens that's not made with ants but in

[1:01:20] but I didn't touch her I said in the
[1:01:22] name of Jesus Christ and now come out of
[1:01:25] her
[1:01:27] and she lose all her strength
[1:01:30] and they didn't have to hold her anymore
[1:01:31] she swiveled down on the ground
[1:01:34] and even when church was over she was
[1:01:36] still snoring on the floor
[1:01:38] she needed rest
[1:01:40] she had struggle with that power of that
[1:01:44] demon inside of her she was like a

[1:02:04] by for knowledge he looked down and saw
[1:02:08] everyone that would accept it
[1:02:12] you know why you accept it it's not
[1:02:14] because you are bright no no it's not
[1:02:16] because you're good you even know that

[1:02:23] there were some that should have
[1:02:25] received this and you should have been
[1:02:27] damned to him
[1:02:30] but by the grace of God
[1:02:34] somebody said I received garment I was a
[1:02:37] child and I've never left
[1:02:40] there's another one that said I run away
[1:02:43] Dave let us feel day with my life
[1:02:47] it's not because I wanted to come back
[1:02:49] but because God

[1:02:59] God rich and mercy for his great love
[1:03:04] weariness lovers when we're dead and

[1:03:21] that's why he sought me and he bought me
[1:03:24] and made his redeeming blood
[1:03:27] amen hallelujah
[1:03:31] and then by doing so he said to say that
[1:03:35] the only way I can do it
[1:03:37] was a calm down myself
[1:03:40] and make flesh
[1:03:42] and take the sin of man upon him

[1:04:43] he's no longer an empty Nesta
[1:04:47] it's children that went out of him come

[1:05:07] Hallelujah the manifestation of the Son
[1:05:11] of God Amen
[1:05:13] hallelujah
[1:05:15] amen so now let us look at him quickly
[1:05:19] so firstly to say Amen if hallelui form
[1:05:24] was the first form was light
[1:05:27] called the pillar of Fire
[1:05:29] and that Pillar of Fire amen hallelujah
[1:05:33] the logos
[1:05:35] the word the Shekinah Glory
[1:05:39] that's his first birth
[1:05:41] god-giving birth to himself
[1:05:45] amen no if I was to draw this because
[1:05:48] sometimes when you look at my notes only
[1:05:50] we can understand it because it's not in
[1:05:52] words it's in symbol
[1:05:55] and I usually Express things as a
[1:05:57] pyramid so you see when we speak of the
[1:06:00] Eternal God
[1:06:02] brother how do you draw that kind of
[1:06:04] board
[1:06:06] an eternal God that filled all time
[1:06:09] space and Eternity
[1:06:12] I cannot project it I cannot draw it I
[1:06:16] cannot write that on a piece of paper
[1:06:18] amen
[1:06:20] the Eternal God
[1:06:22] amen but in order for my mind to
[1:06:25] conceive it
[1:06:27] become the logos he gave birth
[1:06:30] to himself brother Bradham said a
[1:06:33] tangible form
[1:06:35] a light a pillar of fire amen that I can
[1:06:39] look at
[1:06:40] that is why the spill of fire when we
[1:06:43] saw that we should never put William
[1:06:45] branham's picture there
[1:06:47] we put the half minute of Christ
[1:06:50] he said that the best of my knowledge
[1:06:53] that's what I saw it is him
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:57] Hallelujah glory to God yes sir so
[1:07:02] there's a pillar of fire the logos you
[1:07:04] muscle not make any mistake about that
[1:07:09] the Eternal God cannot be fathomed with
[1:07:12] a pen and paper no the eternal spirit
[1:07:17] amen so when he said let us make man in
[1:07:20] our image
[1:07:22] it has not yet appeared but we shall be
[1:07:27] but this we know
[1:07:29] oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen I'm
[1:07:33] trying to reach you now hallelujah amen
[1:07:37] so the logos was the invisible Holy
[1:07:40] Spirit
[1:07:41] the eternal spirit made visible image
[1:07:45] and tangible that was the form he came
[1:07:49] also on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:07:54] the same God that speak the world into
[1:07:57] existence I'd like to say that same God
[1:08:00] came on the day of Pentecost
[1:08:04] and he has not left
[1:08:07] because that same God made you that day
[1:08:11] oh hallelujah amen Glory when you said I
[1:08:15] have the new birth the same one meet
[1:08:18] with you
[1:08:21] and when he met you your life could
[1:08:24] never be the same again
[1:08:28] years ago his brother Dave tautos he
[1:08:31] said fate the bottom of the pyramid
[1:08:33] you're born again experience and then
[1:08:35] you had virtue and knowledge in terms of
[1:08:38] what you want me to tell you something
[1:08:39] everything that you need was in that
[1:08:42] seed
[1:08:43] nothing excluded was in that sea that
[1:08:48] came and he begins to build around that
[1:08:52] experience amen and you said ah he's
[1:08:56] building what a glorious building is
[1:08:57] building hey can I say storms of your
[1:09:02] maturing
[1:09:03] what he was doing he was Destroy what
[1:09:05] you are
[1:09:09] thank you so when I say from Faith to
[1:09:12] Virtue he was destroying what I am
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:17] you can take the horoscope
[1:09:19] and if they say you're born under a
[1:09:22] certain sign
[1:09:23] people can look at you know you and said
[1:09:25] Ah that's exactly what weed is that's
[1:09:28] exactly who he is
[1:09:35] and that they're reading of this
[1:09:37] characteristic that was your nature
[1:09:42] when the new birth
[1:09:43] begin to bring into that image oh
[1:09:47] Hallelujah
[1:09:48] can I say like this it's your six seal
[1:09:51] yeah the I'm a Gideon
[1:09:54] destroy Who You Are
[1:09:59] there is a butterfly in every
[1:10:01] caterpillar
[1:10:06] but in order for that butterfly to come
[1:10:08] out of that caterpillar that caterpillar
[1:10:12] is going to be destroyed
[1:10:14] it's got to have a I'm a Gideon
[1:10:18] so you can have a metamorphosis
[1:10:22] and you've got to have an armagedia
[1:10:26] destroying
[1:10:29] who you are because when it transforms
[1:10:31] you nothing
[1:10:33] nothing of who you were is still there
[1:10:38] Hallelujah don't let them fool you
[1:10:39] nothing
[1:10:42] of what you want but now you're coming
[1:10:45] into the image yes of who he is
[1:10:51] you can take your Bible and hold it like
[1:10:53] the prophet
[1:10:55] or hold it like your favorite preacher
[1:10:58] that stupidity yeah
[1:11:00] because that's not the image that God
[1:11:04] if that's the image that God is bringing
[1:11:07] you to
[1:11:08] oh Hallelujah
[1:11:10] brother Branham that when he looked and
[1:11:12] he'd think of himself and he saw that
[1:11:15] man in that overall he said that's who I
[1:11:17] should have been that's what I wanted
[1:11:19] that's what in my Gene
[1:11:22] but that's not what God wants
[1:11:24] God wants a picture of himself
[1:11:30] it's going to be a day when you look in
[1:11:33] the mirror it's not the picture of your
[1:11:36] daddy or your mama
[1:11:38] no not the genes of your family lineage
[1:11:42] but the picture of God
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:46] hallelujah amen
[1:11:50] yes sir
[1:11:52] Hallelujah
[1:11:53] so the marked in the beginning
[1:11:57] time frame
[1:11:59] an eternal time
[1:12:02] creation time
[1:12:04] that's what he's doing the logos the
[1:12:07] light was not all of the eternal spirit
[1:12:11] but it represents the eternal spirit it
[1:12:15] was an emissary yeah
[1:12:20] and discharging or displaying
[1:12:24] Hallelujah Channel an outlet here's a
[1:12:27] writer of God thoughts Hallelujah the
[1:12:30] logos was the begotten son
[1:12:33] amen yes hallelujah amen now the Bible
[1:12:37] says from the bosom meaning the belly
[1:12:40] the heart of the father declaring the
[1:12:44] invisible eternal spirit John 1 18. amen
[1:12:47] amen amen
[1:12:49] so John 1 18 it says no man had seen God
[1:12:54] at any time get that clear in your head
[1:12:58] if I draw it on paper what would I put
[1:13:02] would I put the pill the picture of a
[1:13:04] square
[1:13:05] it has boundaries do I draw a line
[1:13:09] amen it's got boundaries the Eternal God
[1:13:12] cannot be represented
[1:13:15] it can't be represented come on except
[1:13:20] he reflect himself the logos
[1:13:22] that I see the pillar of Fire
[1:13:25] it come in a form that my mind
[1:13:28] can channel can understand
[1:13:31] a concept of who he is listen until that
[1:13:37] day of your change you never
[1:13:41] never can reflect that eternal spirit
[1:13:45] amen
[1:13:47] Hallelujah amen so John 1 180 no man had
[1:13:51] seen God at any time
[1:13:53] the only begotten son it's a logos
[1:13:57] which is in the bosom the belly the
[1:14:00] heart of the father
[1:14:02] Hallelujah Elohim the eternal spirit e
[1:14:05] the logos US declared God amen amen
[1:14:11] hallelujah oh we could take scripture of
[1:14:13] the scripture now amen hallelujah so the
[1:14:17] next script you know Hallelujah said
[1:14:18] John 1 1-5 in the beginning was the
[1:14:22] world that's the logos
[1:14:24] and the Word was with God
[1:14:27] and the Word was God
[1:14:29] amen now that's my mind picture of God
[1:14:33] Amen the same was in the beginning with
[1:14:36] God and he said all things were made by
[1:14:40] him and without him was not anything
[1:14:43] made that was made in him was life yes
[1:14:47] and the life is the light of man
[1:14:51] and the light Shone in darkness and the
[1:14:55] Darkness comprehended not when the Bible
[1:14:58] says comprehending it did not mean it
[1:15:00] did not understand it it dispel it to
[1:15:04] nothingness
[1:15:05] so light replace the darkness in other
[1:15:09] words the darkness and the light could
[1:15:11] not
[1:15:12] be together
[1:15:14] so when the light project there was no
[1:15:17] Darkness that's what it means it says it
[1:15:19] comprehend it not
[1:15:21] amen hallelujah amen it did not show
[1:15:27] that you and I are either trained the
[1:15:29] Angels cherubim creatures the serpent
[1:15:32] came first Hallelujah in expression
[1:15:35] but the word the logos the pillar of
[1:15:37] fire the Shekinah Glory right Hallelujah
[1:15:40] not the theophany
[1:15:43] no not the theophany the logos
[1:15:47] let me say this quickly to you you see
[1:15:50] the logos is like a veil
[1:15:53] and in that Veil The tiafani is there
[1:15:58] in the eternal spirit God the logos is
[1:16:01] there but until he project him the logos
[1:16:05] Veil can't come out yes now so let me
[1:16:09] say this now so when he project himself
[1:16:12] as a logos
[1:16:13] if the logo should speak of him he says
[1:16:16] my father
[1:16:18] and went from that Veil the logos the
[1:16:20] theophany steps out the theophores say
[1:16:23] of that Veil that I come from my father
[1:16:27] and when that logos that the effort
[1:16:30] remember now the theophany neither eat
[1:16:33] nor sleep
[1:16:35] but when he met Abraham he put on 16
[1:16:38] elements and he heat with Abraham and he
[1:16:42] refers back to the he said my father and
[1:16:46] so Jesus when he came he said my father
[1:16:49] I come from my father because it's
[1:16:51] constantly giving birth to himself
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:57] hallelujah
[1:16:58] amen amen praise God
[1:17:02] Hallelujah
[1:17:04] Hallelujah the word the logos was made
[1:17:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:11] I've been even before he was manifested
[1:17:14] in the flesh
[1:17:15] terrestrial visible
[1:17:17] was the agency of creation so the word
[1:17:22] is
[1:17:24] ah e
[1:17:26] person
[1:17:27] the person the name Jesus was the
[1:17:31] father's name
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:36] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:38] and he received
[1:17:40] me not
[1:17:43] so Jesus was saying let me let's take
[1:17:44] Saint John 5 43
[1:17:46] I am coming my father's name is that
[1:17:50] what he said
[1:17:51] I come in my father's name amen amen
[1:17:54] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:17:57] and he received me not
[1:17:59] he said if another
[1:18:01] home in his own name
[1:18:03] he me shall receive
[1:18:06] you know why they could not receive him
[1:18:07] in his father's name because they didn't
[1:18:09] know his father and neither do they know
[1:18:11] him
[1:18:14] so theology we realize no
[1:18:17] cannot recognize
[1:18:20] God
[1:18:23] and if theology does not recognize him
[1:18:25] the church and all its denomination is
[1:18:29] lost
[1:18:31] because they preach a concept
[1:18:34] of God yeah
[1:18:36] that can never materialize in a body
[1:18:41] amen amen hallelujah amen
[1:18:45] so the Apostle Paul puts it in
[1:18:47] in Colossians 1 15.
[1:18:51] he said who is the image
[1:18:54] so I'm reflecting now Saint John 5 43.
[1:18:58] amen I am coming my father's name
[1:19:02] and so Paul now in Colossians 1 15 said
[1:19:05] who is the image of the invisible God
[1:19:08] Amen
[1:19:09] Hallelujah the firstborn of every
[1:19:12] creature
[1:19:14] for by him were all things created
[1:19:18] that are in heaven
[1:19:20] that are inert
[1:19:21] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:19:25] Thrones or Dominion or principalities or
[1:19:28] Powers all things were created by Him
[1:19:31] and for him
[1:19:33] Hallelujah
[1:19:35] and he is before all things and by him
[1:19:39] all things consist
[1:19:43] and he is the head of the body
[1:19:46] the church
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:49] Hallelujah
[1:19:51] who is the beginning
[1:19:53] the firstborn from the dead
[1:19:55] that in all things he might have
[1:19:59] preeminence
[1:20:01] preeminence now let me say this to you
[1:20:05] that in all things he might have
[1:20:07] preeminence
[1:20:09] now in Christ The Mystery of God reveal
[1:20:11] I personally believe
[1:20:14] when brother Branham preached Christ The
[1:20:16] Mystery of God revealed he was preaching
[1:20:18] the seventh seal
[1:20:21] the coming of the Lord
[1:20:23] that he might reveal himself completely
[1:20:26] in Jesus Christ what have you to do with
[1:20:29] that right
[1:20:30] there's nothing you can do about that
[1:20:32] God revealed himself completely in Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ but number two
[1:20:39] that he might have preeminence
[1:20:43] he might be the first person
[1:20:46] he might have the leading among the body
[1:20:50] of believer listen Church
[1:20:54] if God don't have the leading in your
[1:20:58] life
[1:20:59] you are not of God
[1:21:03] he's got to mean more to
[1:21:11] more to he's got to be first person
[1:21:15] your reason for living
[1:21:19] therefore it's not your desire it's not
[1:21:22] your thought it's not who you think that
[1:21:25] you are or aspired to be
[1:21:27] if God don't have preeminence in your
[1:21:31] life there will never be a restoration
[1:21:34] back to the Garden of Eden
[1:21:38] all Redemption
[1:21:40] would have been lost
[1:21:42] can you do that by yourself
[1:21:45] I tell you before
[1:21:47] the only way it can be done is by the
[1:21:51] word of God
[1:21:53] Supreme deity has got to stand up in
[1:21:57] your life
[1:21:58] and live yes in your life
[1:22:03] everything that you do therefore you
[1:22:06] know the church
[1:22:08] the church
[1:22:11] ought not to be where we come to
[1:22:14] when we have nothing else to do
[1:22:17] you see we don't
[1:22:20] cut we don't come to
[1:22:25] call it we don't come if there's a a
[1:22:28] ball game going on
[1:22:30] we don't come if somebody's sick
[1:22:34] there is so many things we we put before
[1:22:39] the perfecting of our soul
[1:22:42] but Brethren if you look back
[1:22:45] when Israel was in the wilderness
[1:22:48] and the Tabernacle of Moses was set up
[1:22:51] every tribe
[1:22:53] their Direction was set towards the
[1:22:57] Tabernacle
[1:22:59] that's where the Shekinah Glory comes
[1:23:01] down
[1:23:02] it was a central theme of their
[1:23:06] existence no matter what tribe they
[1:23:09] belong to no matter what they do the
[1:23:12] Tabernacle was a central theme of their
[1:23:15] existence because that's where
[1:23:18] the Ark of the Covenant and The Mercy
[1:23:20] Seat was
[1:23:22] brethren they were without the Holy
[1:23:25] Ghost yes
[1:23:35] Lord of an innocent substitute for our
[1:23:38] lives but today
[1:23:42] the Holy Ghost
[1:23:44] oh the Holy Ghost bring you back to the
[1:23:49] image of Jesus Christ
[1:23:51] Brethren if we're going to leave out of
[1:23:53] here
[1:23:54] if we're going to leave out of here
[1:23:56] Christ masava preeminence
[1:24:00] preeminence first person in our lives
[1:24:03] amen
[1:24:05] it must not be just something that we do
[1:24:08] yeah
[1:24:09] and we join a lodge We join a church
[1:24:12] this is more than church this is God
[1:24:16] revealing himself
[1:24:19] into his creation
[1:24:21] and God took the cream we say the cream
[1:24:24] but God took himself
[1:24:26] and place it in the creation we walk
[1:24:30] among Common People amen but Christ in
[1:24:35] you
[1:24:36] Christ in you is a hope of glory
[1:24:41] and the only God
[1:24:44] this world has ever seen we'll ever see
[1:24:47] is a God
[1:24:49] that dwells in you
[1:24:52] and so when God step
[1:24:58] or when that logos comes out of God
[1:25:03] gave birth to himself
[1:25:05] God
[1:25:07] begot God
[1:25:09] amen
[1:25:11] so sometimes you you even talk to
[1:25:13] yourself
[1:25:14] and some of you do it more than some
[1:25:17] really
[1:25:19] and
[1:25:21] you know that's good for your mental
[1:25:23] capacity really because you know the
[1:25:25] psychologist says you can always talk to
[1:25:28] yourself
[1:25:29] but when you when you begin to answer
[1:25:31] yourself then you are you're totally
[1:25:34] gone
[1:25:36] so I could be by myself I said self or
[1:25:40] how you feel today
[1:25:42] if self ever answer me I got to go to
[1:25:45] the asylum
[1:25:48] but God
[1:25:50] but God
[1:25:52] when he saw Hallelujah himself coming
[1:25:57] into tangible being
[1:25:59] amen hallelujah
[1:26:00] it was so perfect
[1:26:02] in his expression and projection
[1:26:06] that God says
[1:26:07] let us make man
[1:26:11] Hallelujah
[1:26:13] he couldn't talk to me
[1:26:15] I was a thought
[1:26:18] but he speak yes through the logos
[1:26:22] because through him created all things
[1:26:25] amen
[1:26:27] and the devil
[1:26:28] knowing who you are
[1:26:32] that you come from God
[1:26:34] and you're going back to God
