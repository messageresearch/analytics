«  17       †          So, you see, if you were in the foreknowledge of God, then you are becoming a part of God. And the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God, you had to be a part of God, and God isn't complete without you. Has to be. That's right, 'cause there is One, only one resource of Eternal Life, and that is God, and Him alone has Eternal Life. See? Now, and you were a part of Him, insomuch that you're an attribute, or in His thinking in the beginning. And that, because He thought of you in the beginning, it gives that little tug towards Him. That's what has to be quickened. Some of them will never be quickened; they just don't have it, that's all.
18    Just like if you put a grain of corn in the ground, didn't have... Ever how pretty it was, if it didn't have the germ of life in it, it can never be quickened. But the germ of life has to be there first.

«  195       †          But He promised, just before the coming of the end time, the world would get like it was in Sodom, when a Man came down in human form; three of them, two Angels and God Himself. That was God. The Bible said it was. Now He came down and He manifested Himself there, by turning His back to the--the tent where Sarah was, and told Abraham what Sarah was thinking in the tent. That right? [Congregation says, "Amen."--Ed.] Now, Jesus Himself said, "At the day when the Son of man is being revealed," in other words, "the Son of man, the ministry of Jesus Christ Hisself."
196    The church will come through justification, through Luther; through sanctification, through Wesley; through the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or the Pentecostals; and go right on into the perfection of the Son of man, that when Husband and Wife will be the same-self persons. God will be so manifested into His Bride, His Church, till they will both be the same. T...

[Music] Oh I want to see a man and a man and a man now see him good as they abide in the house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to where we've been reading from Colossians 3 and we're going to Ephesians 4 were rushing three visions for you doing better or the Kali yeah okay let's keep remember brother copy he's having for the problem in the home so that when you go back

these and doing much in prayer father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord and to us thank you for everything that you've given us we know you've given to us freely and we pray that you would just bless us and guide us and understanding because that's what we desire more than anything else is Lord to see you walk among us and just have your way open our eyes that we may see and Lord got us into that loving grace be with the sick among us Lord there's many many sicknesses and things that are among us we know that we're all getting older and all but that still doesn't mean we can't be healed because we believe you and we thank you as a prophet said we can't ask you maybe to turn back our age because that's part of life but we don't have to accept it either so we can walk in your loving grace and believe thank you for all of these things have your way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name Colossians 3 verse 9 lie not one to another seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds all right now thee that order stop all the line that solves that that's what goes with him right and have put on the new man which is renewed and knowledge after the image of him that created him where there it is neither a Greek nor Jew or in him now circumcision nuns are uncircumcised barbarian Scythian bond or free but Christ is all and in all right now we'll go to Ephesians 4 verse 4 there is one body on spirit as we are all as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all then you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we we've been on this thought for a few services of talking about the all-in-all and I want to kind of just run straight through it tonight and to make sure you follow what I'm talking about you know and then that way you know I had said we'd have questions and answers but we didn't get enough to cover a whole service but if we get to in time tonight we'll at this stage if you got any questions or whatever you know what we're talking about then we'll have questions if not maybe we'll have them Sunday or something so remember that now we have been talking about something that I don't believe this is understood by most people I'm just honest and I'm seeing it from the background of what I've heard and what has you know a little bit I have heard taught and I ain't saying ain't nobody got this we're only one God so you go ahead and think what you won't do that's your business but it ain't none of mine I don't know how to worry about what they're doing somewheres else I'm just trying to get you to see what I'm talking about alright now we talked about the word restoration alright and we say restoration means to restore all things in other words it means something that was previously in existence all right it's restored okay now and sometimes that restoration is a higher development I don't know the word to use correctly to say it but you know it may be in a higher form than originally what was there because it can be you know more coming forth more being said more being done more being revealed alright now we talk about the revealing and look of God okay and we say well now crisis the mystery of God revealed okay all right now then that mystery is hidden in the Word of God and to be revealed totally here in this last day now in doing that then we keep the mind thought of restoration no matter what we're talking about or we've been talking about that God came in three sons names all right son of man son of God son of David now that's the way your prophet we gave you enough I'll read a little bit in them you know to make sure the ones that hadn't heard it won't think it's some brother Dale idea no it's what the Prophet talked that there's three sons names all right now as I was saying Sunday trying to get the thought across remember that anything that would be revealed will be revealed in one of those stations amorphous changing his form revealing himself the way he's making himself manifest or will be involved in son of man son of God son of David alright and it will never end that that won't be done away but that doesn't reveal three gods you know that's three times God is manifesting or it's changing his form to reveal himself to mankind all right now see then a son of man that would be prophet okay now in the Old Testament it was dealing basically with son of man right the prophets son of man prophesy on a man is God revealing short Himself has to be the word you know to come forth all right now then one day that son of man himself walked up on earth in a body called Jesus Christ he was the son of man all right now then he spent all of his life declaring that and never did he openly declare himself to be the Son of God because he was not fulfilling that office all right or that time okay now keep that in your mind that whatever office you're dealing with you're dealing with a specific point and stay with that okay see throughout the Old Testament he could not be made known as son of God you have a couple of instances to work that you could bring forth the word son of God like the the three Hebrew children and one like under the son of God you know you can you ain't say it when I make a statement I wish you would listen I'm not making that there's nothing there but this I'm making the illustration our point that the manifestation is in in greater way of bringing for at that point alright Son of Man throughout the Old Testament alright then brother Brennan said he was birthed into human flesh being the son of man he constantly declared himself I the son of man son of man son of man who'd a man say you are the son of man am he was constantly speaking of son of man alright but then on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost that that son of man released to where it could come back up on the church on the day of Pentecost he didn't come back a son of man time so God changes the dispensation hour changes is amore fiar changes his form from son of man to son of God alright the Prophet said now down to the ages then the church ages he was the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is son of God alright the spirit dwelling within each one of us and remember that the spirit the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God so now remember this don't ever forget that God isn't spirit I mean after all I'll try to teach so much to to bring him more into manifestation to where you can see him more with these spiritual eyes and and trying to make know never forget that he is that that God is the spirit all right now he made himself manifest are brought forth himself in the Old Testament and was showing that but he was showing it as son of man all right then has he come forth in human flesh then see that son of man was standing well where was the son of God inside the Son of Man the Son of man is more referencing to the flesh part are the the manifestation that you can see because you can't see a spirit now that's one thing that we were going to have to remember and I asked you over a couple of services about it I said when you get up to heaven or the future home what are you gonna see we'll see then if God is the spirit you can't see his spirit now come on we've been through that the prophets been through it you ought to know that the head goes this way you means okay you know see then spirit God our God in spirit form that's how do you what he is and he always will be good you'll never do away with spirit God it's the same it's the same God there on earth the Bible according to Scripture said in him dwell the fullness of the Godhead bodily all right what is the fullness of the Godhead by Father Son and Holy Ghost was dwelling in flash right the very soul the very spirit of Almighty God was dwelling in a body that had been spoken into existence by the word and he had become the word according to John 14 and dwelt among us all right now see then following that thought you you keep it lined up see he was the son of man all right when it comes into the church age is the son of God all right now then you got the Nexus son of David well I've asked that simple question to me it's to me it's always been that because I've always decided to look into things like that that how can you go from son of God in a dispensation of the Gentiles of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then go to Israel as son of David that may not mean a thing to you and I wrote my own self a note you say I do not need to know under these things or don't need to understand them well you don't need to understand baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I guess you don't need to understand there's just one true and living God hey let's go home we've wasted a lot of trouble to not people getting ready driving and coming here and I spent two weeks meditating on this thought to try to get it presented in the correct way if there's no God if there's not we might as well go home and forget it let's eat drink and be merry because tomorrow we die it's the brother Dale you're stealing no this exposing the carnality of all of us if we believe it's very important to understand God's Word now you explain restoration to me restoration means to restore what originally was all right now see then you got three sons named son of a man no no God son of David but then brother Branham when we'll read it I don't want to read to put it on here he says in between here he returns his son of man hey now we're right in the middle of restoration you never thought about the son of man had to be restored no we just talked about son of God being restored we talking about the word been destroyed well who in the world do you think I'm talking about the son of man is the word is the god of the word he's the very God himself being made manifest this in a different form or manifestation so then for a little while he comes back at son of man ended odd all of the world in their doings nobody picks it up here comes a little o prophet starts about 1949 this first one I could find saying son of man son of man son of man service either service son of man son of man showing that the god of that had Walt on the shores of Galilee the God that that had created all things was again walking on earth not brother branham now because brother Branham is not the Son of man I've said that in 1969 and I'm still holding on to it all right brother Branham as a son of man the son of man was living in Nice on a man ride very close I'll put it to what he said about us outside of the corporal body there walked in a man on this earth that we call William Branham that outside of the virgin birth and the things of the Lord Jesus it was so close until it's very amazing how he was being used until you can talk about the son of man and that's what I was saying it's in restoration you may have one to be restored you know seeing looking at but when it's made manifest it's a many members body has come from one point back here one was the son of man now coming in the end time to the son of man it comes to bride phone multiple many well-known I just don't see brother Dale I know it you don't see it because you ain't even paying that much attention in the listening you ain't listening to what I'm saying you're listening to what you want me to say you're not paying attention to what I'm trying to say see that son of man back there was promised to be restored we only deal with son of God being restored because that's more or less you know in hours through the ages and the things but why not the son of man being restored now you've got the key that we needed see to be able to balance out and give a correct understanding of how to move along in the gospel that then he go from son of man word made flesh in one human being come over as son of God and the baptism of the Holy Ghost down through the ages then come back in the end time returns the restorer back that son of man that a man will stand there and say more done in my services one not than what's done in the Bible recorded or something you know now that's amazing in it when it was restoration we talked about to some God a restoration we believe in that return the same son of god back he's on the defini Coast restoration all right see then you can go then from son of man son of God son of man son of David know that what brother Dale you got forward now no I ain't got form only region will read to you where the Prophet covers it but that don't stop it see if you're lost into that deal surely what I've been trying to bring out has blinded your eyes I'm serious open your eyes and listen if you can't understand the simplicity how are you going to keep up with a you can't do with the footmen how you gonna keep up with a horsemen gets here see because there's more to it then son of man son of God son of man son of David we got another step to be covered another manifestation another amor fee of Almighty God to make it in five minutes tations now I covered it come on don't don't lose me there's three sons name all right all these five has got to fall under three sons name it's not an addition all right just like brother Branham says see we talked about five three men at three sons night but a brother said he comes in four titles and he brings in son of man a son of Abraham royal grant see he's trying to get us to see the opening of the word that truly that God may be all and in all as I said son Danis it's a shame for you have to express it but when you read the Bible and say that God is all in all that does not mean that everybody in the world has got the new birth that does not mean everybody in the world is safe guess you could read it what I read it to you all and in all so that means he's in everybody like I've told you brother here one time tried to give the Holy Ghost to the cabbage but I didn't agree with it the reason I didn't agree with it it's because I didn't agree with the fact that everybody be safe if you're gonna save with cabbage surely you can save everybody else you say silly that's right but now look what I'm talking about then we'll read it John a man throughout the Old Testament the Ministry of Jesus Christ son of God come on there Pentecost we had a fall in a way of that had to have restorations right but we don't look back at son of man being restored would you look at son of God and remember son of man the Word made flesh son of God the Holy Spirit in mankind God living on in his bride comes back in the son of man through one man yes that then goes out because it was not meant to be left in one man he said how do you know that because if it was only meant to be in one land that had been only one person received the baptism when all the ghosts from their Pentagon so come on get your mind straight did you catch that point if it's just to stay in one man then go back to one man give one man the Holy Ghost under there Pentecost the rest of us are lost so now you know that ain't right okay you see there we hope son of man son of God son of man son of David now remember son of David will be Jesus Christ sitting on the throne of David in the Millennium what's gonna be in the future home that's all I'm asking you son of David is to the millennial reign which is still in time I ask you to read or listen to the tape the future home I'm not going to ask you how many of you did cuz I'm gonna say it most of you didn't I'd only I heard that the other day well you might ought to go listen to it you know brother branham could pick up an eighth day and put it together all the way through the word and come out to the end of it with a number eight mankind was as far as they went was the number seven you know that but there are seven listen the seventh organization is night was the baptism of the holy ghost in arrest right they told it is arrest a new birth is arrest well that's true but the eight goes into the eternity what is he gonna be in eternity what are you expecting to see expected lecture denomination here's the father sitting over here he's got a long beard he's old man here's the son over here he's young looking he's you know and over here is the Holy Ghost fluttering like a dove and you got the Great Trinity from my understanding of the Bible brother Herman Garland I like his leaves and he said I know that's in there cuz I just read it that was just kind of a statement it's worth I know it's in there I just ready well you know according to what I understand the Bible Jesus said I and my father are one and according to that he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well then what if the father look like the son what does a son look like the father okay that's why I said what are you going what are you expecting to see when you get over there on our old man some kind of dove some kind of form hmm I'm expecting to see Jesus cuz he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well you can't see the father that spirit right we'll get to the back to that in a minute but I want to make sure you follow the line up to a spot then we'll continue the thought and go into the future home but I want you to think about it alright then he comes in three sons named son of man son of God son of David this is taking off with God's provided place of worship please I forgot how many times he makes this one statement I just picked this one because uh well as Ricardo read it again the other day you know here now remember they don't have this one they have the they can go ahead and pull up number one go ahead and pull up number one cuz this is a top part right above it remember and the day of the Son of Man will be revealed now remember the son not the son of God he came in three sons named son of man son of God son of David when he was on earth he come as son of man he was a prophet son of man is a prophet Jeremiah self prophets problem on according to the scripture a son of man all right but after his death burial and resurrection now he has been the son of God the supernatural the holy spirit all right did you get number one sorry this is continuation what I just reading but he promised before the coming of the end time the world would get like it was in Sodom when a man came down in human form three of them two angels coming all the way down to where we're doing what's now Jesus himself at that the day when the Son of Man is being revealed in other words the Son of Man the Ministry of Jesus Christ himself brother Branham had the Ministry of Jesus Christ I'll go with our 100% because that's the only thing he couldn't wait could have been that don't make him God but it's the ministry once the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost are the Pentecostals knowing and go right on into the perfection of the Son of Man so now he's got it son of man son of God son of man now we can go to son of David look what he says go right on into the perfection of the Son of Man that when the husband and wife will be the same self persons read that God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same they are one now do you see where we're at alright so what is it to do number two the unveiling of God he came first as a prophet they crucified him his own crucified he came as a son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the son of God God is the spirit he was the holy spirit from God he lived through the church ages the Son of God and now in the Millennium he be the son of David sitting upon the throne of his father David he is the son of David now because that's revealing to you and I we see him already of what he's going to do right look and remember between the son of God not between the son of God where would that be between the son of God and the dispensation or the point you're going to what and remember between the son of God in the lady of sea in church age they put him out who did who did it put out they won't the son of God they won't signs and wonders they won't healings and deliverances and things but they put out the word through the Prophet right come on when the son of man stood here in a human vessel and that don't make him the son of man they say son of man but when he did he stood here and spoke out they put him out they put this message out they don't want this man ain't thought of nobody you think the churches want to get rid of the Holy Ghost come on don't get the wrong idea they won't the Holy Ghost they want the signs and the wonders and the healings and deliverances and salvation which they don't want nothing to do with Son of Man one reason they don't understand it and remember between the Son of God and the latest in church had you put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again it's on Son of Man the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it see the Scriptures taught perfectly together son of man son of God son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in more feet he just changed it it's a great drama to him is acting yeah all right no listen II what paragraph will be all I'm 72 going down to 73 for for his acts he changes his form then he came the son of form of the son of man for the Reformers aged Wesley Luther he didn't come from a man in Lutheran Westland him right come on what's he saying he came in the form of the son of man to give his life in it now for the Reformers age Wesley Luke and all down through we find out that they got it so bundled up just like the is life still do it does not appear he does appear in the last days in the Pentecostal age as the Holy Spirit they rejected they did the same thing Israel and what does he do now return that son of man in the church ages now return to some of them and then from that son of David see how close we are son of man son of David son of God he's revealed in the last days the son of man according to Malachi 4 and the rest of the prophets pertain and they put him outside he's knocking at the door so he comes back as what sort of man at the end of the last age come back his son of man ok restoration not a man restoration ok go ahead in number three cause this is one I like it's taken four crosses the mystery of God revealed they may not have it cuz I change these around so much paragraph 448 we got it they notice God making himself known now we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by government but by the revelation the Christ in you as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ is in you when what God did in Christ Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you isn't that beautiful oh I like it Jesus said at that day for therefore - John 1420 lat this day when this revelation is made known what revelation crisis the mystery of God revealed right you will know that I am in the father and the father in me that's like I said Sunday and I said it over and over that's easy to understand the father was in him the father gave His life and let his life be transmitted that life can be transmitted into you a simple we're look at what the revelation is you will know that I am in the father and the father in me I in you and you and me now explain that I in you as the Holy Ghost coming and living in you right the new birth what is it when it's saying and you and me it's a greater revelation and what we think we think crisis the mystery of God revealed we understand that that just puts Christ in you letter ends wonders in that day you'll know that I am in the father and I knew but what its gonna be when it's you and me how can a mortal be and be a part of God come on we'll get to it man at that day you shall know that I and the father are one I am in the father and the father is in me then when the revelation comes forth then it's I in you and you and me there you are the manifold freefall manner I in you the Holy Ghost coming and living in you but you in me you mean we were in God now that's what the scripture says but yet you're gonna blot yourself out and say I don't believe it and then I'm just too deep and too intellectual I can't understand brother Dale I didn't say it tell me you don't understand the Prophet don't tell me you don't understand me I didn't say it the Prophet is one that said it right now are you with me them God has to be made manifest for changes form you go son of man son God son of man son David now you got four manifestations not for God's you got four times that he's changing dispensations come only one from dispensation Old Testament the New Testament come only when the dispensation the baptism when Holy Ghost coming to the Son of man that's what we just been reading then from the Son of Man he goes to son of David then when he goes to the son of David to the Future home what is he what about him how's he gonna reveal itself then we read the scripture from Galatians and from Ephesians and come in collations colossians colossians 3 said that God may be all and in all something's got to happen something's got to take place what transpires what's gonna happen I kept on that over and over and over it you know how are we gonna be able to go from son of God to son of David you know just wore out on that and you just dried up and said what in the world you're talking about well if I preach father and son Holy Ghost baptism you get on the same time you just drive up well see if one's not important or that's not important to me every word of God is important there's no such thing as something that not being important and there's no such thing as something that said they takes things in the Bible that we'll never be able to be made manifest I don't agree with that your prophets that ever word had to be made benefit I believed him I don't care who else now he said every word has to be made manifest mm-hmm but now listen what's it gonna be like in heaven then we went through the point of what his plan it's not a man son of God son of man son of David we're still in time we're hooked in the Millennium that's the seventh day that's the day that comes back because man fell in the seventh day he didn't fall in the sixth day he created this is he fell on the seventh day as God rested why do you have a millennium the Prophet said to prove the sin curse was gone you were going to house somebody live a thousand years it ain't gonna matter to me and you we're gonna be there on a honeymoon as the eternal as forever will ever be eternal will be that in the Millennium right with somebody he's gonna live a thousand years because he you're still in time by the new birth you have the eighth day in your soul by the new birth which is eternal life but you're still living in a seven in the Millennium so now what are you gonna do what's gonna change us from time to eternity they come on I just said we're eternal when we get dark oh we've got the store and we know what it is we've got the mystery we understand the crisis of ministry we understand why brother Branham would say he said if you get to know seals and don't understand listen to him it's in Chrysler mystery he said come back to this message to understand the seals we go to Chrysler mystery that's what he said you know then the Chrysler mystery let her run and push you in the millennium and puts David on the throne read christ the mystery and you'll see it he puts David on the throne in the Millennium because that's where he's supposed to be that's the promise to David his son Solomon was the natural the Lord Jesus is the spiritual okay what you're hooked in time no wonder brother branham could say and it was told they'd better run the master do you understand what I saw yeah he said I asked you do you understand he said no daddy he said I could count on the hands dealing that understood now that's according to don't quote me as the authority he's playing common sense and you're in the Millennium you're still hooked in time now that's hard to think at little pea-brain brain we've got can't comprehend right well we gonna be there is eternal right because we're already got it here we already have the eighth day of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul what we need is the redemption of the body that comes under the son of man come home sure I know you don't like me but what does the son of man mean to you you know that we Baptist taught the Son of man was resurrection sign it's not a man's sign of the resurrection well I don't care what the Baptist out after will see what I'm getting you just the point I'm trying to get you to see is that brother Branham when he was standing here had the resurrection sign that was the sign of the Son of Man no wonder he can say bring me 24 I believe it was with it of your worst cases I'll guarantee your healing for every one of them right because he had a resurrection sign that's the sign of the son of Mike come on but what about this future home what about this time that you'll go into eternity how are we gonna get from the Millennium to the future home and what's it going to be like remember whatever it is has got to be related to three sons name whatever is in the future home whatever is in eternity as we call it heaven or whatever you want to call it just remember it starts here your eternal life the Prophet says be getting right here to alter we've done had to sign I mean the Lord Jesus has already went through all of those things taking to everything going to the change of the body in walking home the prophets already brought us the message to change these bodies that is the son of man do you not mmm oh how close no wonder the people this message they looked at and I couldn't help it I'd say every one of us in this building to be the same way if we just said with him day in and day out and he said to our encode you have anythi she's gonna catch him any deer he is gonna kill where there's that and what to do it'd be hard to sit there without thinking there's something different about this man right but the main thing about that man was the word not the signs and the wonders but the word signs and wonders was only the bait to catch us put on the hook to catch us it's the word now what's it gonna be like and how can we get there okay let's see what brother Branham had to say about this little point from he covers it in Christ some history then he goes in the future on number four and got it that day the kingdom be given over to the father he might be oh you know the kingdoms got to be given over to the Father now we're gonna read the scripture that we've been reading before only out of Corinthians but just look at what he's saying what Kingdom he that sits with me in my throne what was it as I did overcome sit with my father and his strong sons throne is the millennial reign finality no I said finality don't hold me to the rest of it finality the sun's reign will be in the Millennium sitting on the throne of David we'll be sitting on that wrong will it be just Jesus sitting there who will be there now Luke can read and that that day the kingdom be given over to the father he might be all in all while he's yet speaking out here David crying that's millennium so he ties future home Christ some history ties millennium in the future home into one bundle cause listen to it because that's the millennium David sitting on the throne the king over the whole human race and the water yet speaking I don't know what they're thinking about will they speak I'll answer the wolf and the lamb shall feed together millennium knows what I'm talking about he's gonna have to start in the Millennium to finish in the future home what I've tried to get you to see go ahead to the next time go to the future home and watch TV with his throne in the Trop revelation 21:23 they know life for the lamb landlord is the light there oh the Lord God is the pillar fire that followed the children of Israel through the wilderness and he is ascended up on the throne in that perfect kingdoms one time the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God might be all and in all if it don't climax with him being all and in all Jesus's kingdom which wrought on earth because it would stop in time hey come on folks it's time to wake up Jesus sets upon his throne here is our Joseph and the king is that light that will be on top of the mountain in his holy light will flood the entire the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender worth that ad in the scripture I'm glad you asked that go to number seven brothers we'll get back to six but I want number seven and we read this over and over first Corinthians 15:22 23 whereas in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming knit all together then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God who did what the kingdom that he has delivered delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power listen he who Jesus for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death death is not destroyed the laughter the Millennium come on gets you order you want it from the Prophet what's the next rapture for the bride two witnesses under 44,000 Tribulation part for them Armageddon in the tribulation thousand year millennial reign now you got Gog and Magog to go last enemy that shall be destroyed is death death is done away in the lake of fire from the Battle of Gog and Magog I never heard these things I don't know well I would ask you to take my word for it but they ain't you ain't gonna do it anyway so forget it study the prophets message and see if that's what he say it go get him I'll give you the page where he done I wrote it down where he said this happened this happened this happened this out this happens this happened all right what am I gonna do preach it gotta get this in line with this and the line with this and the line with is wrong over there all right right well what does that matter most of you don't even know maher mageddon is on this side of the millennium there's a thousand years then you got gog and magog Goggin armageddon is more of a nuclear style of destructive they will not blow everything to pieces but Gog and Magog burns ever sinned even sin and even the sinner even the devil and all of that is destroyed in the lake of fire that's gog and magog till the last enemy to be destroyed spiritual death is destroyed by the new birth the physical death was still dying so until that happens until we stop dying once we have to put all things under his feet but when he said all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him that's not a CCE PT he takes accepted that's accepted exe EPT edy I told you go home look it up in the dictionary you don't have a PI's tense of the word except you have accept and you have exception they don't give you the PI's tense and then go into your Strong's and see what it gives you you realize what it's saying come on church okay who guard him sale has put all things under his feet whose feet Jesus's feet you're trying to turn heaven help you look well when he says all things are put under him it is manifest made known or shown that he is accepted not accepted accepted zero and realize what that simply saying when it is manifest this one you're talking about his manifest that he is the all and all not that he's accepted for being that but he is the one who has accepted your name did the Prophet said that it's now that you accepted him he said it's whether or not he's accepted you now we're right back to you in God and God in you if you can get to the God being in you and find out how you and God are one now you're getting to the capability of understanding while that word is put though it's put our to show you not that he's accepted for doing it he is the one who has accepted you come on church which did put all things under him now lift the scripture and when all things shall be subdued unto Him that's when all of this has finished the life the enemy all of these things and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all read it the son himself shall be be subject are you shall be subject subject unto him that put all kinds is the sonship gonna terminate natural reading that's what it's saying son chef ain't gonna terminate but the son ship will become subject okay what about it go back to number six now there you go they're getting faced on this thing on top of Mount Zion will set the lamb and the city only no neither the land above the lamb will be the father listen sounds just like it said something's up here and ones down here and this is going that away and that's it going that away like this that old Catholic priests this is the way it is okay look no need no light for the lamb is a lot their oven above the lamb will be the father which is the low gosh God the great light the eternal light that's that'll shine just above the throne and Jesus will not be on his Father's throne he'll be on his throne the life form before the future home he's son of David come on he'll be on his throne now listen listen to your prophet and the father will hover over the son which the father and son will be one and while they're yet speaking I'll answer before they think I'm thinking farther in my life that that's right and Jesus will commit a perfect perfect age to the the perfect Living God that he has redeemed and give over to the father is that right we'll turn to God the Father which is spirit not a man spirit all nature of goodness and getting everything together us in the end good anything is perverted to form is Satan what's he gonna do the father will hover over the Sun the Sun setting on the throne of David that's where he said that's his last appearance before the future home his son of David son of David is the his Jesus's kingdom remember they asked one set on this side one on that night Kingdom he said I'm not ralphie to do it I can't give all that you realize have you listened see then there's five times see he changed sort of man changed his phone the son of day is I mean son of God James is formed from son of God back to son of man to bring the Pais all of these things then he goes a son of David there's one more change in that future home according to what your prophet is saying Jesus will be sitting on a throne and the father will hover on hover over a little over him that God may be all in all very simple now you can see what he's gonna be you say what's he gonna be like I told you the other day we can thank see we're human beings and these people right over here these denominator think we're crazy well okay let me go ahead what you see brother branham didn't say the 33 of Hoffman's head of Christ was exactly like the Lord Jesus when he said the closest he'd ever seen so what's God look like no no wait a minute that's Jesus well jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father if the father gonna look like an old man with long hair no beard while walking with a croc instead it's gonna be about 19 over here then there'll be a flutter of a dive-off over here and we got it all beautiful in the Bible hog wash his brother done so you say it's a good point hogwash I haven't read what I believe I've read what he said someday the son himself is gonna become subject not that it's going to vanish and do away no that's where you're wrong you ain't listening you cannot see spirit God are you women now now come on hello you want to say did brother Branham say there's a spirit within me but he said you can't see it is that right that you can't see me he said code I'm a spirit remember in the beginning it was God's plan to reveal himself so he had to change yourself into more of a form tangibility x' or something to the word the logos the theophany then he began to create the world that was that spirit God that was that Bible John 14 120 something where he says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth though when we get there that'll be the five times that he changes his form or the fifth time it won't change the more it's the kingdom that the son himself I told you 20 years ago I said one of these days I'll preach to you one card from Genesis all the way from Genesis that same God it just keeps changing its form he just keeps making himself known in another form another form another form if we don't keep that lined up we're just this Trinitarian there's anybody else was Jesus lying when he said I and my father one you've seen me you've seen the father I come in my father's name see that what's the trouble they killed him because he was claiming he was God he wasn't claiming this s to be just the Son of God he was cleaning said to be the son of man and Israel was to be expecting prophets prophets prophets because they went on that son of man remember who was it John which one ass and said well you're their senator or you won the prophets see they look for them prophets I mean life's word see all of this when it keeps unfailing it will finally unveil to the finality that in the future home not the son is a second person or a third person or whatever but the son of man himself the Lord Jesus Christ that has been made eternal by resurrection and everything a change you'll be there but the father will show that he's accepted EXE EP not he is accepted ACC EPT not that he doesn't just accept Jesus he becomes Jesus made manifest because you can't see spirit so he's gonna have to always have a phone then one second that God may be all and in all I asked the question another day at the end can you understand not to sonship terminates like being done away with but son becomes totally subjected until everything is in subjection and he the spirit God himself just hovers over that flesh well now let me ask you a question what about the all and all brother Branham said God is not complete without you right do you need for me to pull it up they've got it God is not complete without you come on you mean God's not complete without you you're looking at the wrong thing he didn't need this anyway this garbage can to him but when he's in you he has accepted you as being his children that all in all he's in he's in here and he's in all he's in his fullness sitting there and brother around him said it I'll get back to these later in him throughout the fullness of the Godhead bodily he said no leaven among the bride brings the fullness of the Godhead bodily you see Church what I saw in 1769 and preached it to bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of Leah now you tell me you're not the word my flesh well then what are you I mean what do you expect you to be what are you thinking going to take place I'm thinking that when we get dire we're going to gather around the throne and when the father hovers over the Sun it'll over over over ever Sun because we're his offspring oh do we need to go in and on it once do we need to discuss anointed ones and his Spirit II and you makes you an anointed one makes you a little Christ what about the remember my point if you don't go into the future home and pick that eighth day that prophet taught in the future home if you don't pick it up correctly you're gonna remain under seven and you're gonna keep on going we're going to all die and go by the flesh by the way of the grave and so will everybody from now on we've got to make a step from there the point of son of David and understanding we're not dire and understanding when we get to the Millennium now listen if you think this ain't right when we get to the Millennium you did at least bumps your head or grinned a little bit while ago when we get to the Millennium you know we can sit on the throne with him right is that scripture do we sit on the throne way I mean he promised us that in his game time we said on a kingdom I thought brother Branham told Daniel that the bride would be the anointing to the temple in the Millennium now the bride ain't anointing to the temple in the future home cause ain't gonna be no temple in the future home the lamb is the temple you say what do you need a temple in the Millennium brother branham said there'll be things in the Millennium that won't be in the future in the Millennium you're gonna have a temple to explain all of these things but you don't need it you don't need a sacrifice altar that's not in the Millennium in the future home you won't even have a temple you won't even have a lot burb they life at us they've lasted us for years me and Lisa we made the most horrible sin that could ever be found out they called her up and it was a police department or something win it anyhow they wanted her to donate they want her to buy some lightbulbs well she bought some lightbulbs well a few days later they called me I bought some lightbulbs willing blockburger this is about as good as the police department I don't make no joke out of that point it's just they didn't last too long so ever since then when something comes up about light bulbs everybody gets me and Lisa about the light alright you ain't gonna need no light bub in the future home you know in the millennium you can have new moons and Sabbath's come on in the millenniums you have new moons and Salva you don't have no new moons and Sabbath's in the future because everything is eternal that's what I said we we're sitting here thinking boy if we could just get through the millennium know somebody's got to go beyond our and for somebody to go beyond our he's gonna have to be revealed here how we get there come home you see since any question excuse me on Star Trek hold it a minute musician any questions you mean I didn't arouse no question that means one or two things you didn't understand me all mixed up one no I'm just kidding come on you see you have some questions write them down I love questions come to the Bible study you'll find out we have a good time we have a good time asking questions I have two or three in relation to back part of the message if we get any more of our Sunday we'll cover them cuz I love questions you know but I don't love questions because question of gender strife you got the scripture but now may I quote the prophet not to change the scripture well what did the prophets say questions makes a strong Church that's what he says questions makes a strong Church when I say it this way questions with answers to them makes a strong Church I'm not correcting him I'm just saying much truth if we just all have questions that ask on gender strife right but if we have questions with answers and a wonderful day going brother well we got less time think on these things five manifestations of God so the man son of God sort of man son of David all in all the son himself becomes subject and God just hovers over him because God is a spirit you can't see him you'll always have to have a form to live in to make yourself manifest would you know he chose that come on let us make man in our own image right did he choose the way we are did he choose the way he is to be what about it well we got Brotherhood 417 he is my everything [Music] is right [Music] is my [Applause] [Music] anybody have a day do you know him as that Savior [Music] what about it amen but believe it would only I do that too it's mine it's more he gave his love and everything here's my [Music] [Applause] yes my smile he gave his life for me is mine everything [Music] is my is my here's my every day and small babies love Granum understatement and [Music] remember that is mine everything another will do what about it what are you looking forward to you think we're gonna get up into heaven and it says it's gonna be I know what a lot of I've heard this talking to message me maybe you hadn't but I heard that ain't gonna be no garden when we get up there we just gonna see each other never heard that one we just gonna see each other and we gonna be God now that's going just a little bit too far you'll see you're doing away with something I've never taught anything in God about doing away he never does away he keeps increasing come on church now listen we can go for the millennium and then go to the future home but remember they'll be the according to the Prophet there'll be a message of cheer down through the ages after we get out of here so it's not over with it's just getting us the place to where we can understand God will see him we'll be like him we'll have a body like unto his own glorious body we'll see him as he is you know what then wouldn't it be something if he could take your revelation back up in time towards Jesus was standing there and said if Philip how have I been so long we have you've seen me you've seen the father because at least you ought to be able to see now Jesus was God made many things right and he's coming to live in our hearts and soul as the new birth one day all in all is gonna gather around that throne ain't gonna be one left out gonna be the bride of Jesus Christ I read you the quote were brought around said husband and wife becomes one that's just an understanding the son of man as husband and wife will be one what a wonderful time father we've tried Lord we just ask him now to help us go home with us take care of everybody give a safe trip and they as we won't Lord we walk in you I pray that I've said enough to work and understand what at least I'm trying to say because I believe it's an ever unfelt it's an ever unfolding revelation of my Lord and Savior all at home guide us now take care everybody remember the stickum on the floor touch each one in Jesus [Music]
