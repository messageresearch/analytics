[0:27] this morning we had a me and brother
[0:30] Aaron had a wonderful time of fellowship
[0:31] with brother Tim last night and and uh
[0:34] we certainly are coming expecting this
[0:37] morning
[0:39] oh let me share my slides
[0:44] let's just go to Lord in prayer before
[0:46] we begin our study Lord we thank you God
[0:48] so much for the ability and Lord to be
[0:52] able to gather together around your word
[0:53] and we pray Lord that you'll just bless

[0:58] we study these things out Lord for the
[1:00] next 30 minutes Lord that you'll just be

[1:04] help us to to to Lord that you'll reveal
[1:08] these things to us we ask the Lord that
[1:10] you'll just bless brother Tim is he's
[1:11] studying the Lord and prepare our hearts
[1:13] to receive what you have in store for us
[1:15] today Lord and we ask this in your name
[1:16] amen
[1:20] in in Hebrews 11 chapter or verse 1.
[1:25] we've been studying how faith is the
[1:27] substance of things hoped for the
[1:28] evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:30] and that's how the elders obtained a
[1:32] good report through faith we understand
[1:34] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:36] of God so that things which are seen
[1:37] were not made of things which do appear
[1:39] and by faith in verse 4 by faith Abel
[1:42] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:44] sacrifice than came by which he obtained
[1:46] witnessed that he was righteous God
[1:48] testifying of his gifts and by it he
[1:50] being dead yet speaketh so by faith Abel
[1:54] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:55] sacrifice and that's that's the thing
[1:58] that made the difference was Abel's
[2:00] revelation of of how to approach to God
[2:03] and the how the situation that he was in
[2:05] and how to get out
[2:07] that it was blood
[2:09] and the maniac of godar brother said
[2:11] Abel had a revelation we're letting it
[2:13] so just a minute it was a revelation
[2:15] that Abel had that made him just
[2:17] he had a revelation of the requirement
[2:19] of almighty God and he brought a lamb
[2:21] and that's the only way that you'll ever
[2:24] be able to see Divine Healing the
[2:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll be by
[2:29] Revelation so Revelation is the most
[2:31] important thing to a Christian
[2:33] the most important thing that's what
[2:35] we're Gathering here today to hear from
[2:36] God so that we can so that God can can
[2:39] speak to us and give an understanding to
[2:41] give us the ability to overcome you know
[2:45] we kind of last time we kind of talked
[2:47] about what is a revelation Revelation is
[2:49] what you know you can be taught a lot of
[2:50] things and you know brother brand will
[2:53] give examples of how the denominations
[2:54] taught a lot of Theology and things that
[2:57] that uh according to just just an
[2:59] intellectual understanding of the way
[3:00] that you read your Bible you can read
[3:02] Matthew 28 19 for example and Come Away
[3:04] with an understanding you think that you
[3:06] know how to get baptized but a
[3:07] revelation is when God pulls the cover
[3:10] back and reveals the thing that was
[3:12] hidden and and gives you the correct
[3:14] interpretation of the thing by by a
[3:17] supernatural understanding so Revelation
[3:19] is like a like I got this picture of a
[3:22] statue that's being uncovered by the
[3:25] sculptor revealed he pulls pulls back
[3:27] the covering and off off comes the
[3:28] covering then you can see what was
[3:30] hidden behind that behind that covering
[3:32] all along it was it was there all the
[3:34] time but it was hidden so Revelation is
[3:37] the act of revealing or disclosing and
[3:40] and if you look online for the
[3:42] definition of revelation to say God's
[3:44] disclosure of himself and his will to
[3:46] his creatures an instance of such
[3:47] communication or disclosure
[3:49] so that's that's what when you read the
[3:51] Bible you can you Can Come Away with
[3:53] just kind of an intellectual
[3:54] understanding but when God reveals to
[3:56] you begins to pull pull the cover back
[3:59] to show you who who he is and what his
[4:02] will is then that's him revealing
[4:04] himself to you and in verse 3 of Genesis
[4:08] 4 it says in process of time it came to
[4:11] pass that came brought of the fruit of
[4:13] the ground and offering unto the Lord
[4:15] and Abel he also brought of the
[4:17] firstlings of his flock and of the fact
[4:19] thereof and the Lord had respect unto
[4:21] Abel and to his offering but unto Cain
[4:24] and to his offering he had not respect
[4:26] and Cain was very Roth and his
[4:29] countenance failed and you know I I just
[4:32] I think sometimes when we study these
[4:34] things out it should be really I I what
[4:37] I really want to do is kind of strike
[4:38] something and you just stir you up to go
[4:40] back and read the Bible and meditate on
[4:42] these things because we're studying out
[4:44] what was Abel's Revelation to go back
[4:47] and listen to the serpent seed message
[4:49] again listen to Listen to
[4:51] um they can go back and and really mull
[4:54] over these things because when you're
[4:56] reading these scriptures like like this
[4:57] one here and you just really began to
[4:59] meditate on why why did Abel why did God
[5:02] able respect
[5:03] why did God Abel respect Abel's
[5:06] sacrifice
[5:07] what was the difference there and am I
[5:09] doing something today can I what's my
[5:12] situation like is God getting respect
[5:14] the way my Approach To God because we
[5:17] all just like it's a it's a story of of
[5:20] a religious but this is a story of a
[5:22] religious person and someone that was
[5:23] had a real revelation of of both both
[5:26] coming trying to approach to God but God
[5:28] respected one and did not respect the
[5:31] other
[5:32] faith is what made the difference amen
[5:35] and the revelation of Jesus Christ
[5:37] program said how did Abel know what to
[5:39] do in order to offer a proper sacrifice
[5:41] to God by faith he received the
[5:44] revelation of the blood
[5:46] Cain didn't get such a revelation even
[5:48] though he had a commandment so he
[5:49] couldn't offer the right sacrifice it
[5:51] was a revelation from God that made the
[5:54] difference and gave Abel eternal life
[5:57] now you might take what the pastor says
[5:59] or what the Seminary teaches and though
[6:02] it might be taught to you with eloquence
[6:03] until God reveals to you that Jesus is
[6:06] the Christ and that it is the blood that
[6:08] cleanses you and that God is your savior
[6:12] you will never have eternal life
[6:15] it is the spiritual Revelation that does
[6:17] it
[6:18] now to think about that that situation
[6:21] that Abel and Cain were both in that
[6:22] they had been taught by their brother
[6:24] Raymond in one place he said that at
[6:26] their mother and father or Adam and Eve
[6:28] had taught uh sat there and and shared
[6:32] them like little bible studies and
[6:33] things like that
[6:35] um and you know you we're maybe in the
[6:37] same situation today I I was sharing on
[6:39] Wednesday night when I was preaching
[6:41] about how when I was young
[6:43] um you know you I'd hear Bible stories
[6:45] from my parents and I'd uh it you know
[6:48] you put it put me to sleep a lot of
[6:50] times and I'd sleep through Bible
[6:51] readings and it didn't really uh you
[6:54] know you just it it could be a lot of
[6:56] theological Theology and even though it
[6:59] might be taught with eloquence and your
[7:01] your pastor might mean not telling
[7:03] knowing what he's talking about
[7:05] um but until when the Revelation strikes
[7:08] when Revelation strikes that's what
[7:10] makes the difference when God reveals to
[7:13] you that Jesus is the Christ and that it
[7:15] is the blood that cleanses you and I
[7:17] tell you when when when Revelation
[7:19] struck when I when I met God for myself
[7:22] and and heard from God then it changed
[7:25] my experience in church now I was
[7:27] interested in what the preacher was
[7:28] saying I I wasn't waiting for him to
[7:31] just fold up his papers and and getting
[7:32] real excited when he started closing his
[7:34] notes that I knew the service was going
[7:36] to be ended you it makes you makes you
[7:38] want to hear more from God makes you
[7:41] want to hear about God because that's
[7:42] the thing that begins to feed you your
[7:44] appetite begins to change
[7:47] you see it you know brother and would
[7:50] say over and over that at Eve's problem
[7:52] was he just couldn't wait and that's our
[7:54] problem many times when we we we fail to
[7:57] wait on God to bring us the revelation
[7:59] of the thing and the spoken word is the
[8:01] Original Seed he said that's what's the
[8:03] matter with Pentecostals today they're
[8:05] manufacturing something they can't wait
[8:07] they just can't wait so they commit
[8:10] adultery tears to manufacture something
[8:13] and what does it bring forth like it did
[8:16] the first time the first bride that
[8:17] couldn't wait God promised to multiply
[8:20] them but they had to wait until God's
[8:23] time
[8:24] now say we we sometimes will we hear
[8:26] something maybe maybe that we don't
[8:27] understand and we try to rush and try to
[8:29] figure it out but if we'll just wait and
[8:31] let God reveal it in his time
[8:34] and spoken word in another quote he said
[8:36] Adam's bride could not wait God had told
[8:38] Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the
[8:40] Earth it was an oncoming thing a promise
[8:44] and in what here is thou Elijah he said
[8:46] we don't have to worry
[8:49] you forget that there's a God
[8:51] well I'll stew up and think oh well if I
[8:54] can't do this if I can act like this and
[8:56] I can't join this keep still and wait
[8:59] for God to speak to you that's the thing
[9:03] so if we can if we could take lessons
[9:04] from some of the mistakes that the
[9:06] people that we read about and just just
[9:08] instead of trying to hurry and try to
[9:10] rush and manufacture something try to
[9:11] force something to happen just wait on
[9:13] God and God will reveal it and manifest
[9:15] it
[9:19] so in in Genesis 1 this is what he
[9:21] failed to wait on in Genesis 1 27 it
[9:24] says to God created a man in his own
[9:25] image and the image of God created him
[9:27] male and the female created them and God
[9:29] blessed him and God said unto them be
[9:32] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[9:34] Earth so God had given a promise
[9:36] but she failed to wait to for God to
[9:38] come and interpret that promise what
[9:39] does that promise mean
[9:41] you know when God reveals it he'll he'll
[9:44] bring it to pass like uh you know uh
[9:47] when when Abel had a revelation God came
[9:49] on the scene and Vindicated that he had
[9:51] the correct Revelation by testifying of
[9:53] it by by accepting his sacrifice and you
[9:57] see can't look at that situation and say
[9:59] well why did not why he he knew that God
[10:02] didn't accept his sacrifice and Abel
[10:04] knew that he did accept his because God
[10:06] came and testified of it
[10:09] and Cain and Abel brought came brought
[10:12] of the fruit of the ground and Abel
[10:13] brought her the firstlings of his flock
[10:15] at the fat thereof
[10:19] and brother Brown will say now look at
[10:20] Cain in the Garden of Eden
[10:22] Cain when he come back to Eden he was
[10:24] just as religious as he could be he
[10:26] brought flowers and so forth and put
[10:28] them on the altar he brought the fruits
[10:29] of the field and laid them down he
[10:32] believed in God
[10:33] he worshiped God
[10:37] he sacrificed to God he built a church
[10:40] to God just as religious as he could be
[10:42] and Abel rolled him up a rock and made
[10:45] him a church or worship place
[10:48] in Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 it says
[10:51] and the Lord God commanded the man
[10:53] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[10:55] mayest freely eat but of the tree of the
[10:57] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[10:59] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[11:00] eatest thereof
[11:02] Thou shalt surely die
[11:05] and in Genesis Chapter 3 Verse 6 it says
[11:07] in the woman saw that the tree was good
[11:10] for food and that it was pleasant to the
[11:12] eyes and a tree to be desired to make
[11:14] one wise she took of the fruit thereof
[11:16] and did eat and gave also unto her
[11:18] husband with her and he did eat and the
[11:20] eyes of them both were open and they
[11:22] knew that they were naked and they sowed
[11:25] fig leaves fig leaves together and made
[11:27] themselves aprons
[11:29] my brother man would say in the message
[11:30] serpent seed I hear I I've never had a
[11:34] preacher to agree with this yet
[11:36] and they try to make it some other way
[11:38] but yet it don't make sense to me they
[11:40] try to say that Adam and Eve eat some
[11:42] apples
[11:43] brother I don't say this for a joke now
[11:45] but I want to say it for if eating
[11:47] apples makes women realize they are
[11:49] naked we'd better pass the apples again
[11:51] you know that's right you know eating an
[11:54] apple that wasn't what they did made
[11:56] them realize they were naked certainly
[11:59] it wasn't it had to come through
[12:00] sexually it had to be because they
[12:02] realized they were naked when they taken
[12:04] this forbidden fruit ain't a woman a
[12:07] fruit tree ain't you the fruit of your
[12:09] mother that was the fruit that was
[12:12] forbidden to be taken
[12:15] now last time we started looking at some
[12:17] of the Jewish tradition of of where what
[12:22] the Jews believed about this to kind of
[12:23] lay a foundation that this um this is
[12:25] something that uh this this is an
[12:28] original Doctrine now in John chapter 8
[12:31] we know that Jesus was having this
[12:32] conversation with the Pharisees about
[12:35] um he said I speak that which I've seen
[12:37] with my father and you do that which you
[12:39] have seen with your father
[12:41] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[12:43] is our father so now they're they're see
[12:45] the Jew the Jews relied so much on that
[12:47] linear their genealogy they would keep
[12:49] such careful track of the genealogy
[12:51] because they believe that that is what
[12:52] gave them a right to the spiritual
[12:55] inheritance was their natural genealogy
[12:58] and they answered and said unto him
[12:59] Abraham is our father Jesus saith unto
[13:01] him if you were Abraham's children you
[13:03] would do the works of Abraham but now
[13:05] you seek to kill me a man that hath told
[13:07] you the truth which I have heard of God
[13:09] this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of
[13:12] your father
[13:14] then said they to him we be not born of
[13:16] fornication we have one father even God
[13:21] now there's a lot of different layers to
[13:22] this passage you could say they were
[13:24] attacking his birth and all of those
[13:26] kind of things but they were let's put
[13:28] this in the context of the of their
[13:31] belief that they knew they knew that
[13:33] this their original story of what had
[13:35] happened in the garden
[13:36] so to kind of prove that let's go back
[13:39] through some early early Jewish writings
[13:41] and and see now a lot of these things
[13:44] that I'm going to read um you know
[13:46] they're they were
[13:48] have dubious Theology and things but one
[13:51] common thread through all of these is
[13:53] that they all made a reference to the
[13:56] what happened in the Garden of Eden and
[13:58] that's really what I'm kind of calling
[13:59] out here
[14:00] in Louisiana Ginsburg in this I wrote a
[14:03] kind of a summary of in his book The
[14:05] Legends of the Jews and he said to
[14:07] summarize what they believe he said
[14:09] after the fall of Eve Satan and the
[14:11] guise of the serpent approached her and
[14:14] the fruit of their Union was Cain the
[14:16] ancestor of all the impious generations
[14:18] that were rebellious toward God and Rose
[14:21] up against him Cain's descent from Satan
[14:23] who was the angel semil was revealed in
[14:26] his seraphic appearance now Samuel
[14:28] Samuels in the in the talmud all the
[14:30] Jewish commentaries they that's the name
[14:32] that they gave for the for the Archangel
[14:34] that that's how they were the the Jewish
[14:36] historians referred to him and um
[14:39] honestly I haven't done too much
[14:41] background on where that came from and
[14:43] all that sort of thing but but that that
[14:45] is there
[14:46] and the um another book called The
[14:49] Gospel of James which is um one of the
[14:52] books that was written in the First
[14:53] Century A.D that was not included in the
[14:56] Canon of what the the Bible this is this
[14:58] is Joseph speaking in this book and he
[15:01] said I received her from the Temple of
[15:02] the Lord God as a virgin talking about
[15:04] Mary
[15:05] but I did not watch over her who has
[15:07] prayed upon me who has done this wicked
[15:09] deed in my home and defiled the Virgin
[15:10] has not the entire history of Adam and
[15:13] summed up in me for just as Adam was
[15:16] seeing praise to God when the serpent
[15:18] came and found Eve alone and let her
[15:19] astray so too has this now happened to
[15:22] me so he's looking at his situation with
[15:25] Mary and now she's got a child and he's
[15:27] saying well now the same thing that
[15:28] happened in the garden is now happening
[15:30] to me and that's the story that they
[15:32] were laying here in this in this book
[15:33] called The Gospel of James
[15:36] and in the in the book of Maccabees now
[15:39] if you know the Maccabees were the is
[15:41] the The Maccabees were the the group of
[15:43] people that um that uh revolted against
[15:46] the seleucid dynasty
[15:48] um just before the coming of Christ and
[15:51] so these these four books were written
[15:52] about their their uh their their story
[15:56] and and in this book it tells of the
[15:58] mother of seven Martyrs that were seven
[16:00] sons that were martyred by Antiochus
[16:02] epiphanies and she her story is she says
[16:05] I was a pure virgin and did not go
[16:07] outside my father's house but I guarded
[16:10] the rib from which woman was made so
[16:12] she's going back she's referring back to
[16:14] that original story no Seducer corrupted
[16:17] me on a desert plane nor did the
[16:19] Destroyer the deceitful serpent defile
[16:22] the purity of my virginity so she's now
[16:25] she's appealing back to that original
[16:26] story uh knowing what happened in the
[16:29] garden that that that the serpent had
[16:31] something to do with the defiling of
[16:33] Eve's virginity and you can read there's
[16:36] a reference there in uh the desert plain
[16:39] refers to the Superstition that demons
[16:41] were thought to wait for women in the
[16:42] desert where they could seduce them so
[16:45] this whole if you put that into all the
[16:47] context of what she's saying there goes
[16:48] back to the the Jews original belief of
[16:52] original understanding of what really
[16:54] did happen in the Garden of Eden
[16:57] another another story is the uh
[16:59] johannenbar napaha was the is the is the
[17:03] fellow that the uh the brother that that
[17:05] compiled the Jerusalem talmud which the
[17:07] talmud is like a commentary on uh on the
[17:10] on the Bible it's like you know today
[17:12] when we read the Bible you can
[17:14] you read a commentary on it that kind of
[17:16] from from Spurgeon or whoever that
[17:19] shares some insights on on the Bible
[17:21] that's kind of like what the talmud was
[17:23] and so this uh Johann manapaha was the
[17:27] uh and I may not be pronouncing that
[17:29] right but he's the one that is really
[17:31] responsible for riding the Jerusalem
[17:33] talmud and compiling all of the things
[17:35] the notes are in that and he says when
[17:37] the serpent copulated with Eve he
[17:39] infused her with lust and that's a
[17:42] pretty that's a pretty pretty uh telling
[17:45] statement about what the what the Jews
[17:46] believe that they they that's what they
[17:49] believed
[17:51] um tertullian was I think where most of
[17:54] us many of us are familiar with a
[17:56] prolific early Christian author from
[17:58] Carthage in the Roman province of Africa
[18:00] he was the first Christian Author to
[18:02] produce an extensive Corpus of Latin
[18:04] Christian literature and tertullian said
[18:07] having been pregnant with the seed of
[18:09] the devil she brought forth a son
[18:11] talking about Eve so tertullian in the
[18:14] beginning and the early stages of the
[18:16] Christian church was aware of what
[18:18] happened in the garden
[18:20] this is another quote from from Jonathan
[18:23] from uh that Rabbi that compiled the
[18:26] Jerusalem town but he said Adam knew his
[18:28] wife Eve who had conceived from semil
[18:30] the angel of the Lord
[18:33] so there's another Eve conceived from
[18:37] from Lucifer for she she listened to the
[18:39] devil's lie and then again he said Adam
[18:42] but got Seth who resembled him
[18:45] for before that Eve had borne Cain who
[18:48] was not from him and who did not
[18:50] resemble him
[18:51] so there's he's he's referring back to
[18:54] now this is a this is a Jew that wrote
[18:56] all the commentary on on what the Hebrew
[18:59] scriptures that called the the Jerusalem
[19:01] talmud and this is his commentary on
[19:03] what really happened in the Garden of
[19:05] Eden
[19:07] and the Gospel of Philip there's a uh
[19:10] it's supposedly written by someone named
[19:13] Valentina it says verse there was a
[19:15] first there was adultery and then murder
[19:18] and he came was begotten in adultery
[19:21] because he was the son of the serpent
[19:23] because of this he became a murderer
[19:26] like his father too and he killed his
[19:28] brother Abel every partnership between
[19:30] those who are dissimilar is adultery
[19:36] there's some more passages from the um
[19:38] the the life of Adam and Eve which is in
[19:41] its Greek version it's this is it it's
[19:45] Greek let me tell you all how difficult
[19:46] it is to find these things
[19:49] that you can't even get the copy of this
[19:52] without paying online so you you have to
[19:54] go through a paywall this is stuff
[19:56] that's that's it's hidden in the in the
[19:58] shadow people
[19:59] it's not laying on the bookshelf at the
[20:02] bookstore
[20:03] the life of Adam and Eve also known as
[20:05] this Greek version as The Apocalypse of
[20:07] Moses
[20:09] is is a is a it recounts the lives of
[20:13] Adam and Eve from after their expulsion
[20:14] from the Garden of Eden to their deaths
[20:16] and it provided this is this is a it's a
[20:18] Jewish book that was written and it was
[20:20] translated to Greek and then translated
[20:22] to Latin but it tells it's the
[20:24] commentary on what the Jews believed was
[20:26] the original story of what happened in
[20:28] the garden of edus it's um and again you
[20:30] know like a lot of these a lot of these
[20:32] many of the things that the Jews wrote
[20:34] about
[20:35] um they they'd embellish and add all
[20:37] sorts of odd things but you you read it
[20:42] with the with the understanding there's
[20:43] this Common Thread that's running
[20:44] through that they knew what happened in
[20:46] the garden
[20:48] it provides more detail about the fall
[20:49] of Man including Eve's version of the
[20:51] story Satan explains that he rebelled
[20:53] when God commanded him to bow down to
[20:54] Adam and after Adam dies he and all his
[20:57] descendants are promised to Resurrection
[20:58] how about that
[21:01] so Eve speaking in this in this book she
[21:03] says the enemy who committed adultery
[21:05] with me does not love me and the
[21:07] Archangel to Adams says behold your son
[21:09] came because he is the son of the devil
[21:12] will slay Abel his brother
[21:15] came the son of the devil
[21:19] now see so you can see we we've uh We've
[21:22] read a lot of a lot of uh compelling
[21:25] evidence that this is not some new thing
[21:27] that came up um it's it's an original
[21:30] original belief that the Jews held from
[21:33] way back and um
[21:37] so in Proverbs Chapter 30 verse 20 such
[21:40] as the way of an adulterous woman
[21:43] she eateth and wipe with her mouth and
[21:45] saith I have done no wickedness
[21:48] the second Corinthians Paul's warning he
[21:51] said I'm jealous over you with a Godly
[21:52] jealousy for I have espoused you to one
[21:54] husband that I may present you as a
[21:57] Chase version to Christ but I Fearless
[22:00] by any means as a serpent beguiled Eve
[22:02] through his subtlety so your mind should
[22:04] be corrupted from the Simplicity that is
[22:06] that is in Christ
[22:07] you can see the original problem if you
[22:10] go and I just want to encourage you
[22:11] maybe maybe when you when you have a
[22:13] moment go back and listen to that
[22:14] serpent seed message again because
[22:16] there's a there's a lot of things that I
[22:17] can share with you in the little Sunday
[22:19] school lesson but there's if you sit
[22:21] there and meditate in the quietness of
[22:23] your home on the things that he's trying
[22:24] to and when you study it out do it like
[22:26] this a lot a lot of times we'll listen
[22:28] to a sermon and we'll we'll um we'll
[22:32] just kind of let it play in the
[22:33] background and not really pay attention
[22:34] but when brother Brown he'll say
[22:36] something really compelling and then
[22:38] when he tells another story after that
[22:39] listen why did he tell that story what
[22:43] does that have to do with the rest of
[22:44] this sermon think about it like that so
[22:46] that the pieces begin to come together
[22:48] why why did why after he said this
[22:50] statement did he start talking about how
[22:52] all the denominational systems are
[22:53] teaching false Doctrine and uh what's
[22:56] what what is the essence of what he's
[22:58] trying to communicate
[22:59] yeah
[23:01] and brother Brown said in the spoken
[23:02] word in that message he said that's how
[23:04] adultery is committed spiritually when
[23:07] you knowing better by the word of God by
[23:10] the Intercourse of the mind taking a lie
[23:13] of the devil against the word of God
[23:16] that's exactly what you've done with a
[23:19] spiritual intercourse first that come by
[23:21] believing Satan's lie into the womb of
[23:23] her mind that polluted her soul set
[23:26] death in the soul then the natural act
[23:28] taken place now look I've got these
[23:30] these words bolded so you can see first
[23:32] first you received in the womb of her
[23:35] mind and then the natural act taking
[23:38] place
[23:39] that's what I'm saying is as you go back
[23:41] and listen to that to consider why
[23:43] brother Branham hit so much in that
[23:45] sermon about how the the denominations
[23:48] teach wrongly about how the right way to
[23:50] be baptized and the right way uh the the
[23:53] correct understanding of the godhead and
[23:55] all these things what because it matters
[23:57] what you believe
[23:58] it matters
[24:00] and that's the only way he said
[24:02] continuing on he said that's the only
[24:03] way that a woman ever can commit
[24:05] adultery against her husband is to first
[24:08] let some man talk her into it
[24:10] first let some man talk her into it
[24:13] I tell her a good idea something seems
[24:16] like a good idea something off
[24:18] and then receive another man that's not
[24:20] her husband then she's committed
[24:21] adultery and when the Bride of Jesus
[24:24] Christ lets man-made Creeds and dogmas
[24:26] take the place of the word of God she is
[24:30] committing adultery
[24:31] and we'll we'll do one more slide and
[24:34] then we'll stop here
[24:36] brother said there stood and I gotta I
[24:38] got a picture here because it's really
[24:40] hard to find a picture of what of any
[24:42] kind of stimulus of the Beast so this is
[24:44] kind of I guess a blending of what the
[24:46] no the normal the Christian the the
[24:48] denominational world thinks of like a
[24:50] serpent crawling around but really the
[24:52] Beast was an upright he had to be have a
[24:54] way to talk a serpent ain't gonna like a
[24:56] snake's not gonna talk but if you're
[24:58] upright and you look like a man and uh
[25:01] you you can have a conversation with
[25:03] somebody
[25:04] they said brother Ryan will say he said
[25:05] there stood Adam and Eve Eve a beautiful
[25:07] woman
[25:08] I can see there Adam with them dark
[25:10] Shaggy locks hanging around his head
[25:12] those bright flashy eyes look over to
[25:14] his little sweetheart Eve and such a
[25:16] beautiful perfect perfect built woman
[25:18] and her hair looked up and her eyes as
[25:21] blue as the sky Adam loved her oh how he
[25:24] loved her but when sin entered in the
[25:27] little home was broke up because of an
[25:28] old lustful Beast the devil had got into
[25:32] an animal called The Serpent not a
[25:34] reptile remember that the Bible doesn't
[25:36] say that the devil was a snake he wasn't
[25:38] a snake in the beginning the snake
[25:41] wasn't like he is now in the beginning
[25:42] the curse put him where he's at the
[25:45] Bible said he was he was not a reptile
[25:47] he was a beast and the most subtle of
[25:49] all the beasts of the field he looked
[25:51] more like a man than anything you've
[25:53] ever had walked upright there's where
[25:56] the devil got in him and come to Eve
[25:58] this beautiful made woman and she did
[26:01] what was wrong
[26:02] and God bless you we'll stop right there
