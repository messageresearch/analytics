[6:00] the Lord would take care of it all right
[6:02] now COO he generally takes care of this

[6:23] and have a time fellowshipping together
[6:25] and what we need to do this afternoon
[6:29] after the evening service we need to
[6:32] meet with all of those and we will
[6:34] renounce this just this evening renounce
[6:37] it - we need to meet and just you know a
[6:40] few words that we need to do and point
[6:42] out for somebody to do so-and-so and
[6:44] whatever to do so we need to do that
[6:46] this afternoon
[6:47] after the evening service okay so we'll
[6:51] meet in the backroom door with the
[6:54] brothers and all okay uh let's see I
[7:00] think I've covered all announcements but
[7:03] anyhow just remember to pray one for the
[7:06] other the Lord would be with us and then
[7:10] first Kings ten first Kings ten one drew
[7:17] nine okay you have any father we thank
[7:23] you for this day in your grace Lord and
[7:25] thank you for all the things that we
[7:28] have already experienced from you this
[7:30] day of life and peace and joy and
[7:33] happiness and rejoicing and speaking to
[7:36] you in prayers and meditations and
[7:39] things Lord and now we come to the point
[7:41] of where we are to sit back and relax
[7:44] and let you speak to our hearts from
[7:47] your word because that's the wonderful
[7:50] part you said in your words that you
[7:53] sent your word and healed us and deliver
[7:55] us from destruction so it's all involved
[7:57] in the word that you've sent unto us and
[8:01] father help us to understand these
[8:02] things and see that it must be revealed
[8:05] to us personally not to just someone
[8:09] else and we can talk about it but to us
[8:12] ourselves we love you and we thank you
[8:14] and have your way with us in Jesus name
[8:17] Amen
[8:28] verse Kings 10:1 and when the Queen of
[8:31] Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
[8:34] concerning the name of the Lord now
[8:37] we're going to get on this evening and
[8:39] be one or two services and we're going
[8:42] to get onto that name of the Lord you
[8:44] know because that's that would be our
[8:46] thoughts and if you will listen or try
[8:53] to read because it's in the conduct
[8:56] order and doctrine on the message
[8:59] questions and answers on Genesis it will
[9:03] be in your first book you got to that's
[9:06] called a condo coder and doctrine but it
[9:08] will be questions and answers on Genesis
[9:11] because we will be starting kind of
[9:13] maybe a little series on the Godhead
[9:17] so we'll be picking up from that part
[9:19] and going on Wade is carrying through
[9:22] into redemption in veins and we want to
[9:25] carry in behind that to follow along so
[9:29] if you well you know just read our
[9:32] listeners that take questions and
[9:33] answers on Genesis 53 I think is the
[9:37] year but in him because we're going to
[9:40] get into something we've got to cover
[9:41] first about the name of the Lord to
[9:43] bring it into being so and when the
[9:46] Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of
[9:48] Solomon concerning the name of the Lord
[9:53] she came to prove him with hard
[9:55] questions she came to Jerusalem with a
[9:58] very great train with camels that bar
[10:01] spices and very much gold and precious
[10:04] stones and when she was come to Solomon
[10:07] she communed with him all that was in
[10:11] her heart now watch that but not called
[10:14] what's the next version then he told her
[10:16] what's in her heart so we read that the
[10:19] way that is really saying it it's saying
[10:22] that she told him of a report she had
[10:26] heard all right and then he does all of
[10:31] the other because listen to that and get
[10:33] it into my she communed with him all
[10:37] that was in her heart and Solomon told
[10:40] her all requests
[10:41] since there was not anything he had from
[10:45] the King which he told her not and when
[10:48] the Queen of Sheba had seen all
[10:50] Solomon's wisdom and the house that he
[10:53] had built and the meat of his table and
[10:56] the sitting of his servants and the
[10:59] attendance of his ministers and there a
[11:01] pearl and his cut barriers and his
[11:04] accent by which he went up unto the
[11:07] house of the Lord there was no more
[11:10] spirit was no more spirit in her and she
[11:15] said to the king it was a true report
[11:18] that I heard in my own land and what she
[11:22] heard of him right that's why she came
[11:25] she said unsaid to the king it was a
[11:28] true report that I heard in my own land
[11:30] of thy acts and of thy wisdom howbeit I
[11:34] believe not the words until I came in
[11:38] mine own eyes had seen it and behold the
[11:42] - told me thy wisdom and prosperity see
[11:46] that the fame which I heard happier thy
[11:49] men happy are these thy servants which
[11:53] stand continually before the end that
[11:55] hear thy wisdom blessed be the Lord thy
[11:58] God which delighteth in thee to set the
[12:02] on the throne of his room because the
[12:05] Lord loved Israel forever therefore made
[12:09] he the King to do judgment and justice
[12:13] you may be seated
[12:15] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[12:18] the word now you know that what we've
[12:21] been doing for quite some time is
[12:27] speaking about you know how that we must
[12:34] have a personal experience with Jesus
[12:39] Christ as our Savior now it's wonderful
[12:43] to hear it we'll review of this in a
[12:45] minute it's wonderful to hear what
[12:47] others have the site of their experience
[12:50] you know but what about yours and that's
[12:54] what I've been
[12:55] speaking on for quite a while and will
[12:57] be going on into many more messages to
[13:02] try to get us to see something personal
[13:06] because it's not just what mama says or
[13:09] daddy says listen it's not even what the
[13:12] Prophet says now listen to another it's
[13:17] not even what God says okay you see them
[13:23] that's not throwing nothing I'm putting
[13:24] it a hole in a whole lot it's what you
[13:27] have experienced within yourself is what
[13:33] you need to be dependent upon all the
[13:35] other is wonderful now you watch you'll
[13:37] see the Queen she comes in that way
[13:40] she'd heard but then she had her own
[13:43] report to be made all right so now
[13:48] what's that about your own experience
[13:50] that's what I'm trying to do is to cover
[13:53] these things to get us to think about it
[13:55] all right now she had heard a report in
[14:01] our country you know travellers going
[14:05] through and things had told her about
[14:07] this great things that was happening in
[14:10] Israel and how that God was doubt had
[14:14] come down and was using Solomon to a
[14:18] great wisdom and glory and things you
[14:21] know and and all of the things she heard
[14:24] about it she heard somebody else but yet
[14:28] she didn't have nothing personal about
[14:31] that at that time but she took what
[14:33] others had said well that's wonderful to
[14:36] take what others have said cause that's
[14:38] the way we hear plague cometh by hearing
[14:40] hearing by the word when somebody else
[14:43] delivers them to us right all right so
[14:45] it's wonderful to hear what somebody
[14:48] else says mama says go to random says
[14:51] God says anything you want to put online
[14:54] it's wonderful for that but then when
[14:58] she got down there and she's seen when I
[15:03] watch what she done she must have had a
[15:05] pretty good
[15:08] you know thought in mind because she
[15:12] took a whole bunch of gold and silver x'
[15:15] and a pearl and all kind of things with
[15:18] her so she was already believing the
[15:20] report pretty good right you know she
[15:24] just didn't go down there empty-handed
[15:25] and ride back and say I'll go get you
[15:27] something bring it to you
[15:28] she was believing it so now that's what
[15:31] I'm trying to get you admitted she
[15:33] believing things in our mental abilities
[15:38] is wonderful you know I think anybody
[15:43] that wouldn't believe in God is not a
[15:45] mental person you know they're not
[15:48] mental at all to not believe in God I
[15:51] don't care what an atheist has to say
[15:53] you know and everything else and they
[15:55] can do this that or the other nothing to
[15:57] me because if you could show me a little
[16:00] blade of grass out in the yard and how
[16:02] it grows and then you tell me there's no
[16:04] God or whatever there's any simple thing
[16:07] so then like I'm say it now to have a
[16:10] mental concept the Prophet said - right
[16:14] mental attitude toward any promise of
[16:17] God will bring it to pass so the Queen
[16:20] of Sheba had the right mental attitude
[16:22] she had heard report and she was
[16:27] believing the report and she took all of
[16:30] the possessions with her and traveled a
[16:33] long journey riding on the back of a
[16:36] camel and I know they all don't do that
[16:39] but I rode one one time and I wouldn't
[16:42] want to ride from here to Lula on one of
[16:46] the suckers I wrote it in a circle that
[16:49] was glad to get off because this is the
[16:52] way you go is this the way you go you'd
[16:56] want to do that for a week in and week
[16:58] out across the desert you know I would
[17:02] hold him solve them humps off the first
[17:05] time in because it being your wife what
[17:07] all right but listen to say we believe
[17:14] then we're going to get back to the
[17:16] point in a minute of word that I've
[17:18] emphasized over and over of your
[17:21] experience in God and how that you say
[17:26] I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior
[17:28] so I know I'm saved
[17:32] well that's a good example or a thought
[17:36] or a belief but as he accepted you we'll
[17:43] get back to that in a minute and the
[17:44] message because that's still our point
[17:48] it's more than just mental believing but
[17:53] it starts at mental believing she heard
[17:56] the report she believed the report you
[18:01] know cause this is an example maybe she
[18:05] heard this group coming through and
[18:06] maybe the next train around emphasizing
[18:09] one time you know she'd go out and ask
[18:10] him about this and happening and you
[18:13] know he could hear over and over and
[18:15] over of the great things so she begin to
[18:18] believe when we've heard the gospel over
[18:21] and over and over and we need to believe
[18:24] it at least all right but it needs to be
[18:27] more than that and that's my point now
[18:30] when she came down she said verse 6 then
[18:37] what was reading she said I heard in
[18:41] other words a true report now how did
[18:46] she know the report was true you know
[18:51] how did she know the report was true
[18:53] because she saw what they had told her
[18:57] right she saw happening she said I heard
[19:01] a true report she didn't say I just
[19:03] heard a report of you and talked this
[19:05] over and thought I'd ride down and see
[19:07] how it's going
[19:07] no I'm trying to get you to a thought in
[19:11] your mind because all we get from God
[19:17] first starts as a mental talk mental you
[19:21] know thought in your brain all right God
[19:26] don't come down and grab you just open
[19:28] you up and just dump it all in you know
[19:31] no faith cometh by hearing hearing by
[19:35] the word
[19:35] all right and we believe it you know and
[19:39] we believe that report but we ought to
[19:42] be able to do I remember my wife we were
[19:44] listening to tape right after we came in
[19:47] the message and you know she was sitting
[19:51] there we listening to a tape one day and
[19:52] she said like one thing for sure he what
[19:57] happened in that man's life is what he
[20:00] saying happened then we don't have to
[20:02] worry about it he had to be a prophet
[20:05] now that was just a statement you know
[20:10] from your background of what you're
[20:12] thinking a statement to come forward to
[20:16] her if you would be agreeing and knowing
[20:19] that that's right huh so she said I've
[20:22] heard a true report and said now I see
[20:28] see so the way she knew the report was
[20:31] right was the fact that she could then
[20:34] see of the great things taking place are
[20:37] you following me all right and she did
[20:40] she said it's only been hiked old me in
[20:46] other word they don't worry about God's
[20:50] got a lot more all right but she made
[20:52] she heard a report now listen
[20:55] she heard a report she believed a report
[20:59] that was made then she experienced gee
[21:05] you know in her own eyes and think of
[21:10] what she had heard
[21:12] it became an experience to her that was
[21:16] more real than the true report she heard
[21:20] true report was fine but now she has
[21:23] something he can take back to Solomon
[21:28] and she can say it was only high filled
[21:31] me you said you see the way you do in a
[21:35] way everything works and says it's
[21:38] wonderful all right now report is like a
[21:42] speech word you like speak in our
[21:46] utterance so she made a report
[21:51] speaking back to Solomon all right she
[21:55] made the report of what she experienced
[22:02] then proverbs blues 15:30 says the light
[22:08] of the iris rejoices the heart and a
[22:12] good report makes the bones fit in other
[22:18] words you enjoy it
[22:19] it's just something that comes to being
[22:22] enjoyment right to you a good report but
[22:25] what about a false report Philippians 4
[22:33] and 8 says to witness that report
[22:44] finally brethren whatsoever things are
[22:47] true whatsoever things are honest
[22:49] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[22:50] things are pure whatsoever things are
[22:53] lovely whatsoever things are of a good
[22:55] report if there be any virtue if there
[22:58] be any praise think on these things
[23:03] think on these things if it's a good
[23:07] report
[23:09] now what about it as I said she believed
[23:15] a report but then she had a personal
[23:19] experience of seeing that report made
[23:26] okay
[23:30] there's many many reports that have been
[23:32] made throughout the Bible you could take
[23:35] the whole Old Testament and spend the
[23:37] rest of the day talking about Moses at a
[23:39] burning bush when God calls him and said
[23:44] Moses I want you to go down in Egypt and
[23:46] he says ain't going because your Bible
[23:50] this is emphasized he said I'm not going
[23:53] he said but I'm the God of Abraham Isaac
[23:56] and Jacob he said but I'm not going but
[24:02] then when he
[24:03] witnessed and seen and he asked him as
[24:06] we'll get to this afternoon and then God
[24:08] said in other words Moses said what's
[24:10] your name
[24:11] I go down to tell them the God of
[24:14] Abraham Isaac and Jacob who sent me so
[24:16] that's wonderful because they know all
[24:17] about it but I want something personal
[24:21] to be related to me and God said okay
[24:26] just tell them I am that I am and see
[24:32] that made it ever-present for eternity
[24:35] to him because that was not what was
[24:37] said that was an title to a name that
[24:41] when you translate it it comes out to
[24:44] say I am that I am understand what I
[24:48] mean he didn't come to necessarily say I
[24:50] am that I am he said a name he said a
[24:53] title or something and when it is just
[24:56] interpreted I am that I am all right
[25:00] literally it means ever president for
[25:02] eternity okay so now we will get into
[25:05] those salt this afternoon but what about
[25:08] you and your report what about you and
[25:15] your thoughts what is your report you
[25:24] know you go good denominational Church
[25:27] and you say what about Hebrews 13:8 or
[25:30] something and then say well sure we
[25:33] believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[25:34] today and forever but now we believe in
[25:41] to be the second person of the Trinity
[25:45] now is their report correct
[25:50] there was only see this afternoon when
[25:52] you start talking about a name then why
[25:55] brother Branham would make the statement
[25:57] you can call him Jesus Jesus and still
[25:59] not getting nothing why because you may
[26:04] be calling now he said in Spanish hey
[26:06] Zeus or whatever something that you say
[26:09] in Spanish and it won't matter to God
[26:11] because he knows all the name German
[26:13] Chinese whatever they also know
[26:18] who you're approaching and the way
[26:22] you're approaching yeah but you just
[26:25] make it to work you make it too
[26:27] complicated brother Dale what is
[26:30] complicated about it what's complicated
[26:36] to know the truth I thought it was
[26:40] supposed to set us free huh so now think
[26:43] about it when she had a personal
[26:47] experience of seeing what took place
[26:51] then she made the report he says only
[26:57] the hive has been told me to made a
[27:02] wonderful report what is your report we
[27:07] could go with the Hebrew children in the
[27:09] fiery furnace Oh King live forever I
[27:15] said we're not going to bow down to your
[27:17] honor it's okay you go in the fiery
[27:21] furnace
[27:22] okay go in the fiery furnace they had a
[27:26] mental concept and thought of God
[27:28] because there was no holy ghost back
[27:30] there to bring on a true new verb but
[27:35] through that mental talks days neither
[27:37] statement or report we're not going to
[27:42] buy down and you know what that report
[27:45] brought it brought God into the fiery
[27:50] furnace right what they say it brought
[27:55] God he wasn't it they just took them
[27:58] down and sold them in and then he goes
[27:59] jumps in with him now their report that
[28:02] they made in other words they was
[28:05] telling that King Oh King live forever
[28:07] we pray for you god bless you
[28:09] everything's great
[28:11] we said we're done been told on to bow
[28:13] down before idols and we're certainly
[28:15] not going to bow before you and really
[28:18] you know who their honor was it but how
[28:21] do you pronounce it comes a direct
[28:23] Meshach Abednego was actually worshiping
[28:25] well DeShazer is that the word is that
[28:27] the word for that which was really
[28:30] image of Daniel there's a pretty good
[28:33] time to tell the three Hebrew children
[28:34] what you mean Daniel one of you guys and
[28:38] you mean you're not going to bow down
[28:39] before Daniel it's a no we're gonna make
[28:44] a good report we don't bow before nobody
[28:48] making a report that's what we're
[28:50] getting at but what about it what is
[28:55] your report
[28:58] okay what about going over with us now -
[29:06] we're going over to number four brothers
[29:10] probably bypass the scripture we just
[29:12] quote them in Isaiah 53 it says
[29:17] something that's wonderful to me who had
[29:22] believed our report and to whom is the
[29:25] arm of the Lord revealed now I don't
[29:30] read Bible like maybe others I'm sorry I
[29:34] read to try to understand what is being
[29:39] saying now he said who has believed our
[29:43] report so Isaiah had made a report we
[29:49] say oh that's just in there for us
[29:51] that's where most people read the Bible
[29:53] that's just in 9 for us to read
[29:56] who had believed our report would be
[29:58] good if you made it that personal but
[30:02] Isaiah had wrote 52 chapters he had made
[30:08] a great report in 52 chapters right he
[30:12] had spoke of the coming of the Messiah
[30:16] he spoke of the Virgin to conceive he
[30:20] had spoken of John and phorid of their
[30:23] 42 you know coming to introduce the
[30:25] Messiah he had covered the basic entire
[30:30] journey of mankind in 52 chapters so
[30:36] he'd made a pretty good report don't you
[30:40] think so
[30:42] that he went to all of those things are
[30:44] you listening - it's not just an insect
[30:47] see that's the way we studied the Bible
[30:50] to try to find her I never know I'm
[30:52] forgive me for being straight you said I
[30:55] never noticed it said that before that's
[31:00] okay but you know what you're done you
[31:02] just didn't read it right you didn't
[31:08] read it right it didn't change from one
[31:11] week to the next you know you didn't
[31:13] read it one time and then get a new
[31:15] edition and read it
[31:17] alright spine to what you're saying but
[31:19] think about it
[31:20] the Bible's always said that it never
[31:25] taught her Trinity no word right but we
[31:31] believe in it you know what we believe
[31:34] we believe it said dad
[31:38] and what about Isaiah standing there
[31:41] with all of that that he had wrote 52
[31:46] chapters then what does he say who has
[31:53] believed our ripple work like the queen
[32:01] of sheba she'd heard the report she
[32:06] experienced a report
[32:08] Isaiah knew of God very prophet but then
[32:16] he was commissioned to write and he made
[32:21] his report
[32:21] like I said read through dark where you
[32:24] get to come into the virgin conceiving
[32:28] you get all of the things you get John
[32:29] coming in you get all other things
[32:31] happening sometime just read Isaiah and
[32:33] then when you do and you finish it up me
[32:36] so we know what Isaiah made a good
[32:39] report cuz we reported about one true
[32:43] and living God he reported about the
[32:45] coming of the Messiah he reported about
[32:47] John the Baptist he reported about all
[32:49] of the things to happen in the world and
[32:51] then he says who had believed I
[32:55] for now you know basically what people
[33:01] are the message read they don't believe
[33:04] who they don't read that who had
[33:06] believed our report they read the other
[33:08] part that's just a read up to that's the
[33:11] thought coming up to really they say
[33:13] because whom is the arm of the Lord
[33:15] revealed and then they go to brother
[33:16] Branham and take the arm of the Lord as
[33:18] will show it a minute where he says it's
[33:20] the power of God they're not interested
[33:24] in the report they're not interested in
[33:33] all it's been set up to their of 52
[33:35] chapters about the coming of Jesus
[33:39] Christ the only interesting to find out
[33:43] what if the pile wanted the arm of the
[33:45] Lord you will find out what I'm talking
[33:50] about in a minute the arm of the Lord
[33:53] comes from were Isaiah had already
[33:56] covered it in 52 chapters because the
[34:01] arm of the Lord is the word of the Lord
[34:03] right and the word of the Lord was 52
[34:07] chapter talking about the coming of the
[34:09] Lord
[34:09] they brought around his covers it and
[34:11] said and then we can read it in there
[34:13] you can take the book of Isaiah what is
[34:15] it 66 books in the Bible and Isaiah has
[34:17] 66 books in it he covers the beginning
[34:20] of the world he covered all the way to
[34:23] the future home make it a pretty good
[34:27] report in it but think about it now so
[34:31] he asked the question he said I've made
[34:35] a report about this I've taken all of
[34:42] the other Scrolls that their writings of
[34:45] things and I've concluded it by making a
[34:48] fifty two chapters report something
[34:55] pretty personal
[35:00] let me say it this way I've told you in
[35:05] 52 chapters what God told me to tell you
[35:10] is that Alright I told you what God told
[35:15] me to tell you he could say this that I
[35:20] said here is thus saith the Lord now
[35:23] what is thus saith the LORD know what
[35:25] you say that's why people won't do that
[35:29] you don't say that's at the Lord
[35:31] remembered us say if the Lord is what
[35:33] the Lord says right it's not what you
[35:39] say it's what the Lord says when you say
[35:42] the staff the Lord you said the said
[35:43] Samuel Dale you're supposed to be
[35:45] telling people what I say not what you
[35:47] think about what he's been saying right
[35:51] okay now getting the point to where we
[35:54] can go with it he covered the coming of
[35:59] Jesus Christ the Redeemer all of the
[36:01] things and then he makes a report he saw
[36:09] something personal then he makes a
[36:12] report it was only so go ahead to what
[36:14] we've got on number four what if you got
[36:17] it right there now watch his report who
[36:19] that believed our report into it and
[36:21] he's going to make a report from
[36:22] personal like I said I believe he
[36:28] believes 52 chapter don't you when he's
[36:32] summing up 52 chapters you don't read
[36:34] that away
[36:34] he's summing up 52 chapters he's going
[36:38] to make his report now watch him once
[36:40] you can cover Jesus Christ right to the
[36:42] G or he shall grow up before him as a
[36:47] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[36:49] ground he have no form dark ominous
[36:53] calmness and when we shall see him there
[36:56] is no beauty that we should desire him
[36:58] for not straight to the Messiah in the
[37:02] crucifixion huh God what good is your
[37:06] report if you don't have a report of the
[37:10] Messiah and the crucifixion
[37:13] the coming of Jesus Christ is well and
[37:16] good but was it doing you and I because
[37:19] look now or he shall grow up before him
[37:23] as a tender plant and his root out of
[37:25] dry ground
[37:26] he had no form nor comeliness Road
[37:28] around and said when he looked at him
[37:30] actually he said when they got to
[37:32] beating him he looked like a piece of
[37:33] hamburger meat that's just a story a
[37:35] statement because they beat him in 39
[37:37] stripes and just ripped out everything
[37:41] and we shall see him there is no beauty
[37:44] that we should desire him he is despised
[37:47] and rejected of men a man of sorrows and
[37:50] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[37:54] were our faces from him he was despised
[37:57] we esteemed him not
[37:59] surely had for our griefs and carried
[38:01] our sorrows if we did esteem him
[38:03] stricken smitten of God and afflicted
[38:05] but he was wounded for our
[38:07] transgressions he was bruised for our
[38:10] iniquities fifty two chapters are you
[38:12] following me and now he's going to make
[38:15] his own report 52 chapters of God
[38:20] telling him what will take place now he
[38:22] goes to prophecy straight in through the
[38:25] coming of the Messiah and the
[38:27] crucifixion are you with me about it see
[38:29] that's the way I think but he was
[38:31] wounded for our transgressions he was
[38:33] bruised for our iniquities the
[38:34] chastisement our peace was upon him and
[38:36] with His stripes we were healed all we
[38:39] like sheep have gone astray we have
[38:41] turned every man to his own way and the
[38:44] Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[38:46] all he was oppressed and he was
[38:47] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth
[38:49] it brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[38:51] and as a sheep before her Shearer's is
[38:54] dumb so he opened and not as a mouth he
[38:57] was taken from prison and from judgment
[38:59] and who had declared his generation for
[39:02] he was cut off out of the land of the
[39:04] living for the transgression of my
[39:05] people was he stricken he made his grave
[39:08] with the wicked and with the rich in
[39:10] death because he had done no violence
[39:12] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[39:15] it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had
[39:17] put him to grief when thou shalt make
[39:19] his soul an offering for sin he shall
[39:21] see his seed he shall prolong
[39:25] are you winning we can go on reading the
[39:29] Scriptures but are you following what
[39:30] I'm saying after 52 chapters he said do
[39:38] you believe what I have said who has
[39:42] believed our report our hood that would
[39:47] be all the prophets right who had
[39:50] believed the prophets report then he
[39:54] makes his own report in spirit of
[39:56] prophecy and go straight to Calvary and
[39:59] describes Jesus Christ hanging on a tree
[40:02] and how he was done we could say I had a
[40:09] true report all the prophets have spoken
[40:14] this but only the height has been told
[40:22] and said now I want to describe to you
[40:25] what that spirit because the other
[40:27] prophets didn't necessarily cover the
[40:30] crucifixion huh they can because you can
[40:34] bring it in but Isaiah spends almost a
[40:36] whole chapter or even more right on the
[40:39] crucifixion of Jesus Christ he's making
[40:44] a report he sees something not
[40:48] physically he's not tired when it takes
[40:50] place he sees it by the Spirit of the
[40:53] Lord in prophecy and what's closer would
[40:58] you need for anything you understand
[41:01] what I'm getting at you believe that
[41:09] what Isaiah said came to pass
[41:15] he wasn't dying
[41:20] run you wasn't done you're only taking a
[41:27] report
[41:31] you got the writings of Matthew Mark
[41:34] Luke and John huh which that's writings
[41:39] of Matthew Mark Luke and John that's a
[41:44] true report right but I wasn't there he
[41:56] wasn't there we need something more
[42:00] personal than to just to say the report
[42:03] of somebody else now quote the Prophet
[42:09] he said has it come off the pages into
[42:12] your heart what about your report if
[42:22] your report is that he's one of the
[42:24] Trinity one of the three gods is your
[42:32] report that he is just a oneness star
[42:41] what is your report
[42:47] and do you have a witness we have a
[42:54] witness what is your report I believe it
[43:05] cause the Prophet said it well and good
[43:09] that's not your report that's a prophets
[43:12] report I believe it called God said it
[43:15] that's the God's report
[43:16] what is your is it simple not
[43:25] deliberately done what I've done on
[43:28] asking you about your experience until
[43:32] two or three messages preaching parts
[43:34] about it but never fully answering any
[43:40] of the thoughts but just to get it into
[43:42] your mind the brother Dale I don't
[43:47] understand you because I accepted Jesus
[43:50] Christ as my savior it's his business
[43:54] from their own it's good for you see why
[44:06] it's so important to hear the truth
[44:08] the Bible doesn't say if you hear
[44:11] hydrous are part truth are lies it is to
[44:17] save you you see why it's very very
[44:24] important what you hear well God knows
[44:31] my heart as to where we're at we'd be in
[44:37] good shape he didn't know it I've always
[44:40] told you sounds odd for a preacher he
[44:42] believes in one true Living God
[44:44] but sometimes it would be nice if they
[44:46] was a Trinity
[44:51] because maybe somewhere in the channel
[44:53] between here and dark of the three of
[44:55] them whatever might could help me out
[44:58] you know
[45:00] and if not get all the way to the head
[45:02] man too worried how to destroy me one
[45:06] more year Sydney I agree we but is it
[45:08] right is it right see we know he's just
[45:18] one true and living God when Isaiah
[45:25] ended up in the twelfth verse or Darfur
[45:26] I will divide him a portion with the
[45:30] Great and he shall divide the spoil with
[45:33] the strong because he had poured out his
[45:35] soul unto death and he was numbered with
[45:38] the transgressors any by the sin of many
[45:40] and made intercession for transgressions
[45:46] what about your report I've asked this
[45:50] question over and over to you he say
[45:54] I've accepted Jesus Christ
[45:59] that's wonderful but why is it that
[46:04] people who come to the altar and accept
[46:09] Jesus Christ why does it not go on to
[46:16] bringing them to salvation well they're
[46:21] foolish virgins will not necessarily
[46:23] because remember until you get to Holy
[46:26] Ghost you can fall now after you get to
[46:29] Holy Ghost you don't fall but you can
[46:31] fall in justification you can fall in
[46:33] sanctification and remember word
[46:35] rejecters go to hell so that depending
[46:38] on what you do it right
[46:47] - who had believed our report you know
[46:56] what we read where brother branham said
[46:57] it off the message God's provided way
[47:01] number five you want to pull it up and
[47:03] just by accepting him what only do God's
[47:13] got to vindicate back that he has
[47:17] accepted you that's the thing you can
[47:21] accept him but then if he accepts you
[47:25] listen stay there until he does accept
[47:30] you
[47:30] so evidently it's not as I accept him
[47:33] he's saying stay there until he accepts
[47:38] you right
[47:40] well I accepted him what else you want
[47:42] me to do that's what the Baptist say
[47:44] right that's what the prophet and say
[47:47] about them see they say well they Brown
[47:49] believed God what else you think you
[47:52] could do that's fine that's true but
[47:57] what God dude Abraham and God giving you
[48:03] a sign that you have been accepted or
[48:09] you like the Queen of Sheba that you're
[48:12] believing unto because that's what she
[48:16] was doing when she heard the report she
[48:18] was believing untrue she had nothing
[48:21] personal to prove to anybody but when
[48:27] she went down and experienced it you
[48:31] know in the court of law you can't give
[48:33] your sight then where'd you go up her
[48:37] and say I'd say brother Colley told me
[48:39] he saw Sean John they say forget it
[48:41] forget it that's hearsay cousin went to
[48:43] two miles if you don't see something
[48:46] personal you can't witness to it
[48:48] right okay he said you can accept him
[48:57] but then if he accepts you
[49:01] stay right there until he does attention
[49:04] and then when he does he seals you into
[49:09] his kingdom by the baptism of the Holy
[49:12] Spirit you say well I've accepted him
[49:23] but as he accepted you what do you mean
[49:29] I believe the message I believe the
[49:34] Bible it's well and good but that's the
[49:43] Queen of Sheba with her own true
[49:45] reported even she said I heard until
[49:50] went something personal to her and
[49:54] Isaiah we used that because he moved up
[49:56] into a greater realm he had all the
[50:00] background of 52 chapters and then he
[50:05] says who had believed our report
[50:09] well then once it was already made like
[50:12] I said very little it said back down
[50:14] through that coming of a virgin and
[50:16] every time but you know what I'm getting
[50:18] happened to what I'm saying that most of
[50:20] your prophets never talked to the virgin
[50:21] birth most your prophets never talked of
[50:24] the coming Messiah you know in letter
[50:27] words and thing most of them were just
[50:30] timewise and what God was doing and the
[50:33] different things were taking place but
[50:34] as they have summed it all up by
[50:36] bringing it into his what God had given
[50:39] him then he makes a report if you're
[50:48] saying what somebody else says where's
[50:50] the Holy Ghost involved
[51:00] so we went on to give the one when
[51:02] Jehovah Jireh says don't look at
[51:05] yourself look at your lamb God don't
[51:09] accept you he accepted the lamb he said
[51:18] well I accepted him and he accepted me
[51:21] now I accepted the lamb worldwide now
[51:28] because that means he accepted me what
[51:32] is your understanding of the lamb
[51:34] what if you rejected the lamb what if
[51:45] you rejected the lamb I don't mean
[51:49] nothing like I've always said I've
[51:55] always told it this way and always
[51:56] believed it everybody in the Old
[51:58] Testament took a lamb up drove it down
[52:01] on the altar so that's my sacrifice that
[52:04] done away with my sins they went home
[52:06] with her sin no he don't understand they
[52:11] wrote down the dishes were throwing
[52:13] throwing throwing soap and he's sinned
[52:16] or forgiven not if it ain't sincerity
[52:23] then God got tired of all of those signs
[52:26] didn't he you get tired of hearing me
[52:29] quote that scripture I guess God got
[52:31] tired of man and his this is mine good
[52:37] well you know who that fits under if
[52:40] it's under Cain and what did he say Cain
[52:47] said Lord I've done what I've done you
[52:50] take it or leave it
[52:53] well we know what happened he left it
[53:01] you see where we get into that though
[53:03] it's just me I would put it brother Tala
[53:06] I've been a Christian a long time praise
[53:09] the Lord
[53:11] now quote Paul have you received the
[53:14] Holy Ghost since you believe may I ask
[53:19] you another question
[53:20] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[53:21] you come into message when I wonder
[53:26] you're talking about too many Holy Ghost
[53:28] know this asking a simple question
[53:31] that's what Paul was all run upon
[53:35] believers that would believe in Jesus
[53:37] was the Christ and teaching it and he
[53:41] said have you received the Holy Ghost
[53:43] since you believe so it evidently is not
[53:46] when you believe when you get the Holy
[53:47] Ghost it's when he accepts you we need
[53:55] except your lamb then he gives you
[53:56] something right is that true
[54:00] circumcision number seven is the top of
[54:03] the Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham a
[54:07] circumcision sign after he had accepted
[54:10] God on his promise and walked out into a
[54:15] strange land I heard he had accepted God
[54:26] on the promises and got up went on come
[54:35] on and if you need from brother Branham
[54:37] oh I've accepted him and maybe you need
[54:40] where he says but he gave God the Son of
[54:44] God gave Abraham the son of circumcision
[54:56] - what was our number eight God gave him
[55:00] the sign of circumcision as a
[55:02] confirmation of his recognition of his
[55:09] faith you see your you want to lay onto
[55:17] me all the time you don't listen I said
[55:22] I kept asking the question he's have
[55:26] accepted God but I asked a simple
[55:29] question as he accepted you well I'm in
[55:34] the message now we're in a time where we
[55:41] can light things down kind of a little
[55:43] hard and hurt with it
[55:45] but there's no need of hurting with it
[55:47] this true what about these people that's
[55:50] preached this message for 40 or 50 years
[55:55] and now turned away some of you know
[56:00] nice personally and you would have never
[56:04] and some of them maybe was instrumental
[56:06] in bringing you into the message was he
[56:15] a believer
[56:21] I liken that to one thing that I love
[56:23] brother branham in his way you know
[56:25] Balin we want to talk about bad guy and
[56:28] everything else available you know that
[56:30] brother branham said he wouldn't in too
[56:32] bad a shape today until he met Elijah
[56:38] now you make sense a lot sure which one
[56:40] okay nothing problem when Balaam was
[56:44] confronted by a true prophet then is
[56:50] when he showed his color could I like
[56:53] the statement right around said he said
[56:54] to be a prophet in Israel was a great
[56:56] thing you realize Balaam had a record
[57:02] probably of all of his prophecies you
[57:05] know that he spoke of the Messiah you
[57:07] know he spoke of the coming of the Lord
[57:09] by them in his own writings so he
[57:14] wouldn't a false prophet until he met a
[57:18] genuine prophet now watch what I'm
[57:22] saying a genuine prophet or the hour
[57:24] because Balaam would have been a prophet
[57:27] until then but then when he witnessed
[57:30] and would not father elijah he became a
[57:37] false prophet that's how simple it is
[57:46] what about the preachers this message
[57:48] preached 50 years and swore screamed and
[57:52] hollered at you that you had to believe
[57:54] a prophet he had to this that the other
[57:56] and you're lost if you don't you've been
[57:58] there and today where are they then may
[58:07] I say it without hurting feelings were
[58:10] they making a true report all the way
[58:13] down through that and then turned around
[58:15] made a false report always a little
[58:22] something wrong all along they just
[58:26] never faced a real truth you realize
[58:31] what makes a man turn against this
[58:32] message is the fact some work something
[58:35] he rejects it and by rejecting it maybe
[58:39] a simple fact of you saying you believe
[58:43] it in my life is placed upon me believe
[58:52] it you know all you got to show you is
[58:56] what my life is not whole thing is not
[58:58] based on this never now y'all look like
[59:00] y'all make too much of that profit see
[59:02] that's how easy it get started until it
[59:07] destroys the people but you ask them
[59:12] today have you accepted Jesus Christ as
[59:14] your Savior oh yes it will where's your
[59:19] evidence what you mean where's your
[59:24] evidence
[59:28] I'm a quoting brother branham well
[59:31] brethren what can we do
[59:32] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[59:35] unto him for righteousness
[59:38] that's a good actor statement right then
[59:42] you know that's the truth if it's
[59:44] handled correctly
[59:50] what about when you inject some ID or
[59:53] thought is God going to give you the
[59:55] baptism of the holy God now remember I
[59:59] do not believe you understand this
[1:00:03] brother Dale I do not believe that God
[1:00:07] is going to accept your faith and give
[1:00:09] you the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:00:11] then one day take it away from you
[1:00:14] now I don't believe that so there's
[1:00:18] something wrong somewhere
[1:00:21] right well you're saying them fellas
[1:00:25] never was saved saves one word
[1:00:26] born-agains another word saved is an
[1:00:30] honest confession of a heart and
[1:00:31] believing it and saying it salvation is
[1:00:34] when God gives you the seal of
[1:00:36] circumcision God gave Abraham the sign
[1:00:44] of circumcision showing he had been
[1:00:47] accepted right has he given you the
[1:00:56] baptism of the holy ghost to show you're
[1:00:58] accepted now don't jump hollering I'm in
[1:01:01] the message don't go that way
[1:01:04] okay I believe everything I probably
[1:01:07] said like I said don't come in my office
[1:01:09] and say I believe everything to probably
[1:01:11] see it because I might bring up some
[1:01:15] things that I don't think you believe
[1:01:22] okay
[1:01:25] so she asked me a question I'm gonna
[1:01:27] answer it
[1:01:28] you think I'm a dirty dog a hard lean
[1:01:31] person I try to do the best not spraying
[1:01:33] lies not God please get that off of me
[1:01:37] get it off of me
[1:01:39] I know what everybody thinks they think
[1:01:40] I'm hard and mean that comes I'm
[1:01:42] arrogant I'm just an I'm trying to save
[1:01:47] your soul we get on that other side you
[1:01:53] will thank me for it to try to tell you
[1:01:57] the truth you realize what you could say
[1:02:00] you can say I've accepted Jesus Christ
[1:02:03] as my savior and every day of your life
[1:02:05] have accepted Jesus Christ as my savior
[1:02:08] I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior
[1:02:10] get on the end of it and find out he
[1:02:12] never accepted you
[1:02:24] has he given you the sign of
[1:02:25] circumcision I steal ours where we go
[1:02:31] I'm in the message I believe the Prophet
[1:02:33] you want we name a few of these gadgets
[1:02:36] but only for 50 years and where are they
[1:02:39] today every brother do we've got a few
[1:02:51] years think you're the only ones got it
[1:02:52] I'm the only one that I know this guy is
[1:02:56] that any problem I'm the only one I know
[1:03:01] this guy now everybody else got to say
[1:03:04] the same thing right if they won going
[1:03:07] out of Georgia I'm sorry y'all gotta
[1:03:09] move my wife better head to Tennessee no
[1:03:13] there's one going and I'm it right no
[1:03:19] but I said oh no it's true then he gave
[1:03:29] Abraham the sign of circumcision showing
[1:03:32] he had accepted his believing and he
[1:03:36] given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:38] showing he's accepted you're believing
[1:03:45] now anything that you name I started one
[1:03:53] evidence Satan can impersonate I'm not
[1:04:01] against it I believe in gifts I believe
[1:04:04] in signs and wonders I believe in an
[1:04:06] emotional thing I believe in crying I
[1:04:08] believe in shouting I believe in all the
[1:04:10] works of God in everybody that's born
[1:04:15] again doesn't have the same or you call
[1:04:20] it mechanical isms or whatever what
[1:04:24] would be the right word to be used in
[1:04:26] other words one speaking tongues one
[1:04:27] shout one cry one do this one's out of
[1:04:29] the other I believe in that you tell me
[1:04:32] brother Dale I received the Holy Ghost
[1:04:35] brother Tatum I remember his experience
[1:04:37] he said I was sitting out under a tree
[1:04:39] and he said it was like raindrops just
[1:04:43] falling all over me you know what I
[1:04:46] believe that he said we're brother Dale
[1:04:52] these are that people go wrong then
[1:04:55] we're saying that you need to have an
[1:04:56] experience remember and experience is
[1:04:59] what you live through a sensation is
[1:05:01] what you can have anytime an experience
[1:05:05] is something you live through but wonder
[1:05:08] groped around safe the baptism of the
[1:05:13] holy ghost and watch him without a
[1:05:16] sensation now what's he saying show me
[1:05:22] where he ever said the baptism of the
[1:05:23] Holy Ghost without an experience well
[1:05:25] but you don't understand experiencing
[1:05:27] since I don't know you don't understand
[1:05:29] experience and sensation not the same
[1:05:31] than God now quote the Prophet just
[1:05:39] remember you jump up and down shouting
[1:05:41] holler
[1:05:41] he said just make sure you walk straight
[1:05:43] when you come to hell have you accepted
[1:05:51] your faith and giving you the baptism
[1:05:58] when the Holy Ghost the new birth
[1:06:01] there's never been a baby born that the
[1:06:06] mother didn't have an experience and the
[1:06:08] baby had fun right we're going through
[1:06:11] the things that went through but I like
[1:06:16] that where he said without a sensation
[1:06:18] so you're saying well I just don't have
[1:06:21] to do nothing it's just what I believe
[1:06:25] Abraham believe but God done something
[1:06:27] else
[1:06:36] what about it yeah but you're trying to
[1:06:39] tear down everything I've ever believed
[1:06:41] if I can turn down once you believe me
[1:06:43] I'll quote brother I'll he said why
[1:06:45] don't you go apart let brother Dale talk
[1:06:46] you out of what you think you believe
[1:06:48] you remember that real you know if I can
[1:06:52] talk you out of it you know what it
[1:06:53] means
[1:06:54] you can have it it is that special so
[1:06:59] you say you're against me I'm not
[1:07:00] against somebody hey I have to face
[1:07:02] these in the notes when I write them so
[1:07:09] whatever you say is your experience was
[1:07:19] it the new verb or a sensation and
[1:07:28] remember but a random said I don't
[1:07:33] believe in stillborn babies so I don't
[1:07:37] believe in the new birth coming without
[1:07:39] an experienced sensation is stimulation
[1:07:44] upon your senses etc so he said this
[1:07:48] even the Holy Ghost without a sensation
[1:07:50] that's been running to the ground the
[1:07:53] see dark the prophet said he didn't
[1:07:54] believe in sensation he never said he
[1:07:57] didn't believe in sensation he believed
[1:08:02] his experience then plenty of sensations
[1:08:09] no we're okay
[1:08:16] but are we willing to accept correction
[1:08:25] you know we're good old backdash it's
[1:08:30] been 50 years since eyes are I still
[1:08:32] well remember it I can't deny the father
[1:08:39] because if I deny the father I'll deny
[1:08:42] the son you know the Bible says in
[1:08:43] heaven feet you're not about you drive
[1:08:45] sir
[1:08:45] maybe if I deny the father and honor
[1:08:48] that's why I've got to have Lord Jesus I
[1:08:50] got our Father Son Holy Ghost in my
[1:08:52] baptism because if I deny the father it
[1:08:54] means I deny the son so I've got to go
[1:09:00] that away is that true or is that a lie
[1:09:08] or may I quote brother branham deal I
[1:09:21] what about all of these anointed ones
[1:09:23] around the world today that great signs
[1:09:26] and wonders are happening in their
[1:09:27] ministries but yet they won't accept the
[1:09:36] truth what's wrong what God knows what
[1:09:42] our brother's health now quoted random
[1:09:47] people will say it's better to go on in
[1:09:49] the framework of organized religion to
[1:09:51] serve God then they're not serving at
[1:09:54] all that's how the church age boo now
[1:09:57] finish the rest of it to believe Satan's
[1:09:59] lie is to serve Satan there's going to
[1:10:04] come a time when we're going to be
[1:10:05] presented to us then we can keep a
[1:10:07] church as long as we just not change but
[1:10:13] just back up a little bit and just
[1:10:15] change things you see the Bible said to
[1:10:24] be wise as a serpent harmless into doing
[1:10:26] I'll tell you something that I've been
[1:10:28] doing for over 30 years deliberately
[1:10:32] watching my word you think my wording is
[1:10:34] tough I'm deliberately staying away from
[1:10:37] calling people homosexuals
[1:10:39] we are etc etc why come on sure if you
[1:10:47] think they end up on what we do and I
[1:10:49] remind you of a few weeks ago when I
[1:10:52] titled a sermon examine in yourself that
[1:11:04] was the title of the sermon examining
[1:11:07] your sails because it's what the Bible
[1:11:09] said examine yourself see whether
[1:11:11] unifight you know what they pull us off
[1:11:14] the internet until we protested all
[1:11:17] right what'd you call it Facebook true
[1:11:18] or what all those things like our ears
[1:11:20] are starting to do it Joe Tim can tell
[1:11:22] you they pulled it off because that
[1:11:25] could be examining you know like feeling
[1:11:27] of people so even that word phrase
[1:11:31] brought up a red flag and a jerk us off
[1:11:35] till they clarified what we were talking
[1:11:36] about do we've got to be wiser serpent
[1:11:42] Harmon to do it ain't on compromising
[1:11:44] nobody will just tell it like it is
[1:11:47] formal setting wordings as wise as i can
[1:11:49] to keep from being caught because i know
[1:11:54] what they're doing and that's proof
[1:11:55] right back dark of what I've told you
[1:11:57] all along they will do to us they'll
[1:12:01] take your words and tire you to pieces
[1:12:12] so I read a lot
[1:12:22] I come out here to motor state when I
[1:12:23] said one of these days the black lights
[1:12:26] going to fight and die like flies they
[1:12:29] could pull us off the internet for that
[1:12:32] but when I read and say brother Branham
[1:12:35] sat down
[1:12:37] they can't publish because I'm saying
[1:12:41] what he says hey we were in
[1:12:45] Jeffersonville 1968 I guess it was in
[1:12:51] the World Council of Churches ordered
[1:12:54] the Brenham Tabernacle to give them a
[1:12:57] church age book had a court order know
[1:13:02] why go to vada asked us we'd settle my
[1:13:09] thousand of them right but you can't use
[1:13:12] that you can't pick up something that's
[1:13:14] got william branham written on it and
[1:13:17] use it in a court of law
[1:13:19] you think they ain't smart and know what
[1:13:21] they're doing they got a court order and
[1:13:25] got a church age book you know why they
[1:13:27] can take that church age book to court
[1:13:31] what about Brennaman brother Branham and
[1:13:34] all of it saying about colored people
[1:13:37] and it's that the other they could get
[1:13:40] him for a hate crime if I'm reading him
[1:13:43] they got to go back to him
[1:13:44] I do a lot here
[1:13:50] you said well what's your whole story
[1:13:53] whole story is one time what are we
[1:13:56] depending upon to say that we're saved
[1:13:58] today don't start it off we believe in
[1:14:03] the message but then I'll just refer it
[1:14:07] right back to these it's believed in 50
[1:14:09] years and where are they okay brother
[1:14:15] Randall what is the evidence the Holy
[1:14:19] Ghost go ahead with number eight a what
[1:14:27] is the evidence and I want you to read
[1:14:29] this with plain common sense
[1:14:36] today I was talking with a good friend
[1:14:38] dr. Lee Vail who is present now and he's
[1:14:41] quite a theologian so we usually have
[1:14:44] some out some pretty good discussions on
[1:14:47] the scripture verse very small he asked
[1:14:51] me one time what I thought about the
[1:14:53] initial evidence of the oligos was he
[1:14:56] speaking in Congress it's been many
[1:14:58] years ago I said no can't see that he
[1:15:02] said neither do I so but I've been
[1:15:06] calling he said what would you think
[1:15:08] would be an evidence
[1:15:12] here's your prophet it's off the message
[1:15:16] broken sister in 1964 I said the most
[1:15:21] perfect evidence I can think of in love
[1:15:27] so we got to talking on that and I
[1:15:30] thought that sounded pretty good so I
[1:15:32] just held that if a man has got love
[1:15:40] what about a prophet having to be
[1:15:42] corrected and admit he was corrected but
[1:15:50] one day the Lord and a vision
[1:15:51] straightened me out he said that the
[1:15:56] evidence of a spirit was those who could
[1:15:59] receive the word neither love nor
[1:16:02] speaking in tongues when it's receiving
[1:16:04] the word can you receive the word yes it
[1:16:20] fits what I believe right
[1:16:25] sarcastic okay what is it true and you
[1:16:30] tell me you want to go and leave
[1:16:32] websites and see all these now that are
[1:16:34] saying Bertrand was wrong
[1:16:36] and we're wrong and all this wrong we'll
[1:16:38] just call from we're doing it you'll own
[1:16:44] the simple question
[1:16:46] I believed our report and to whom is the
[1:16:53] arm of the Lord revealed they run said
[1:17:00] you can pull it up if you want to but
[1:17:02] let me find it there will be number 10
[1:17:11] which is on the sixth seal we have to
[1:17:15] believe our report and to whom the word
[1:17:17] of the Lord is revealed leave the report
[1:17:22] in the arm of the Lord is revealed the
[1:17:24] arm the Word of God is revealed
[1:17:29] but if power power go to God power to
[1:17:33] God spoke no word of God ain't no power
[1:17:38] it's all fake because remember there's
[1:17:41] only two powers they're really enable
[1:17:43] one there's what God and what he permits
[1:17:46] the devil the house so don't go with
[1:17:48] power go with the true evidence that
[1:17:52] your prophet even said he had to be
[1:17:55] corrected it's whether or not the spirit
[1:18:02] in you let me I add one word to that
[1:18:04] without you babe only that the word let
[1:18:08] me use this one little word whether or
[1:18:10] not the spirit II and you continually
[1:18:12] agrees for the word because I'll tell
[1:18:16] you these is preached fifty years said
[1:18:19] it's that Greek we heard but they didn't
[1:18:22] continually agree with or because it
[1:18:23] come down to something if you want to
[1:18:28] know what anybody's about evidence or
[1:18:30] what it got is just take the word to
[1:18:32] them like I said you Pentecostals what
[1:18:36] was your ideas look them in huh I just
[1:18:41] earn your spirit yeah what did the
[1:18:47] Prophet say how do you check the spirit
[1:18:50] of an individual no matter who is you
[1:18:56] checking by the word
[1:18:59] hey come on you be sweet lovable and
[1:19:03] everything else but you just keep
[1:19:05] nailing that word down keep tapping that
[1:19:07] word and just keep hitting that word
[1:19:10] it'd be like the ladies you know well I
[1:19:14] don't think I need to just you know I
[1:19:16] think I just cut my heart paint my face
[1:19:19] God knows my heart I've accepted him as
[1:19:23] my savior
[1:19:24] and he knows my heart you won't tell god
[1:19:29] damn remember you are telling God that
[1:19:33] when you speak it out of your mouth the
[1:19:37] Queen of Sheba was making a report of
[1:19:39] what she saw it witness what about you
[1:19:41] and I come on musician the arm of the
[1:19:52] Lord is a revealed word it is not
[1:19:55] letters on the page the word may I quote
[1:19:58] right around them I got them laying here
[1:20:00] the word is not just to say the gospel
[1:20:05] the gospel is the Word of God
[1:20:08] presented by someone who has experienced
[1:20:12] that gospel or else is what somebody
[1:20:16] else said what about your experience I
[1:20:23] believe every word probably says who was
[1:20:30] one wooden said he could run around he
[1:20:32] said I downtown now I say I doubt that
[1:20:41] now here's my statement from the whole
[1:20:43] time John made over 50 years now I've
[1:20:51] tried to make one report to this church
[1:20:56] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:20:58] today and forever
[1:21:00] and this prophets message is right
[1:21:05] remember Wednesday night
[1:21:10] remember Wednesday night when I was
[1:21:12] preaching that the headstone to the
[1:21:16] church is the revealed word which is
[1:21:20] this message revealed to you and I
[1:21:23] because the cornerstone was a revealed
[1:21:26] word about Jesus Christ this is what the
[1:21:31] disciples never received because they
[1:21:34] didn't understand malice um Matthew 24
[1:21:40] come on Jesus preached six healed and
[1:21:43] none of the disciples knew anything
[1:21:45] about what it said so what is the
[1:21:48] headstone the revealed word all of the
[1:21:54] revealed word those disciples made a
[1:21:57] true report you agree the faith of the
[1:22:00] Father is a good report but they never
[1:22:04] witnessed the opening of the full entire
[1:22:06] word but you and I have laying before us
[1:22:13] in this message of the hour
[1:22:19] the Word of God if this is not the
[1:22:25] headstone than you're admitting or
[1:22:27] saying there's something else has got to
[1:22:29] take place you're saying there's
[1:22:35] something else to come won't you show me
[1:22:42] even the advocates that that's part of
[1:22:45] what the prophet call because come on
[1:22:47] like I told you about the brother
[1:22:49] sitting at the house that time and said
[1:22:51] run around swept off the foundation we
[1:22:54] got to build a building I said would you
[1:22:56] do me one thing one favor would you tell
[1:22:59] me something types of future home
[1:23:00] because bread around them is preached
[1:23:02] all the way to the future home and
[1:23:04] described it to a team of where
[1:23:06] everything was out so if you're going to
[1:23:09] tell me something you tell me out
[1:23:10] pi-star
[1:23:11] well he just kind of left no he knew
[1:23:15] they wouldn't know neither argument over
[1:23:16] what I done made my statement I made a
[1:23:20] report about this message
[1:23:24] 50-something you and my report is when
[1:23:30] the bride of Jesus Christ comes to the
[1:23:33] realization of who she is I'm quoting
[1:23:35] brother Branham and what she's here for
[1:23:38] she will be an investable army that's
[1:23:40] how the church age book that's my report
[1:23:43] that I've done for 50 years I see in the
[1:23:52] ministry the brothers is just preached
[1:23:56] recently laid the Bob the Dilys of the
[1:24:06] era I see them making a report and the
[1:24:16] report is about the body of Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:21] I'm glory in that they've catching home
[1:24:24] and you said we don't think it knowed it
[1:24:26] before you go play with all you want to
[1:24:29] somewhere else I've waited for somebody
[1:24:35] to come and say I see it I've had
[1:24:41] brothers to come here and soir from this
[1:24:44] very pulpit that they saw what I was
[1:24:47] talking about and brother day all the
[1:24:51] message he brought is perfect and not
[1:24:56] why did they leave without giving an
[1:25:04] answer of why they were leaving
[1:25:11] well I know the answer they just don't
[1:25:14] like your attitude
[1:25:15] now show me anywhere in the Bible that
[1:25:18] an attitude is you mean you don't
[1:25:23] believe it
[1:25:25] I'll remind you a dumb don't key now
[1:25:32] what kind of an attitude that he have
[1:25:33] let me ain't even alive a human being
[1:25:36] get it correct to the profit well they
[1:25:44] just don't like the way you preach
[1:25:46] because you pretty so much that you
[1:25:47] preach like that you're the only one
[1:25:49] that's got it I'm the only one that
[1:25:50] knows I got it anybody want to argue the
[1:25:54] point but you see around the world now
[1:25:58] is picking up some of these ministers
[1:26:02] come in coming in or picking up some are
[1:26:07] still preaching six and seven messages
[1:26:08] you know what I mean by that it's the
[1:26:10] old days Macy's 50 years ago messages
[1:26:13] and not seeing anything personal the
[1:26:17] lies for massachusett was grown of these
[1:26:19] brothers each one of them was talking of
[1:26:22] a witness of a personal experience may I
[1:26:30] give them my hand but I don't believe it
[1:26:35] well why don't you come and show me
[1:26:37] where it's wrong all I've ever preached
[1:26:40] is a personal experience a personal
[1:26:44] witness of Jesus Christ living in our
[1:26:47] hearts because outside of that you're
[1:26:50] saying what somebody else said who has
[1:26:56] believed our report now listen and
[1:26:59] you'll know the scripture who had
[1:27:01] believed our report into whom is the arm
[1:27:03] of the Lord revealed who is the Word of
[1:27:07] God revealed - there's your evidence for
[1:27:13] the Holy Ghost there's your evidence of
[1:27:17] whether you've been accepted or not well
[1:27:21] you mean brother tense I got a walk out
[1:27:23] today you'd say I wouldn't accept no I
[1:27:25] saying you are you never said nobody
[1:27:33] left his church turning the word down I
[1:27:35] said they made your own statement I
[1:27:38] walking out the door I don't have to
[1:27:45] make a statement let's leave our report
[1:27:50] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:27:53] revealed the whom is the Word of God now
[1:27:57] may I finish the message I started
[1:27:59] winter Steve while worried about the
[1:28:03] headstone until you see for sure to the
[1:28:08] cornerstone and a little worried about
[1:28:13] the headstone because there's no way to
[1:28:15] understand and be like brother branham
[1:28:17] coming out to earn ohio river and say
[1:28:19] the headstone here you know what it was
[1:28:22] but there's no way that mankind could
[1:28:26] ever get what he's talking about because
[1:28:28] they surely didn't even get what he
[1:28:29] talking about after 50 years or
[1:28:32] something like 30 years or something
[1:28:33] trying to preach but you're not looking
[1:28:37] which I'm looking for this message to be
[1:28:40] revealed because you tell me one time in
[1:28:46] this Bible that has not been revealed a
[1:28:53] way of the Prophet

[1:29:09] kind of take place then are you going to
[1:29:14] tell me the faith of the fathers don't
[1:29:15] agree with it are you going to tell me
[1:29:18] all of this back behind doesn't agree

[1:29:30] declared Jesus Christ in his crucifixion
[1:29:33] in the 53rd chapter he had everything
[1:29:37] behind him and then he made his
[1:29:41] Proclamation if he ever did they started
[1:29:48] okay you got your ideas you're a human
[1:29:53] being
