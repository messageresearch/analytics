[0:00] understanding he didn't understand in
[0:01] the spiritual maybe but you have to
[0:03] study and pray and seek God okay that
[0:06] that's part of the Christian journey and
[0:10] Lowell is all grown over with thorns
[0:11] cares of life
[0:13] look hey Jesus talked about that and
[0:15] locate and that which fell among thorns
[0:19] are they which when they have heard go
[0:21] forth and our choked with cares and
[0:23] riches and pleasures of this life and
[0:25] bring forth no fruit to perfection
[0:34] okay
[0:36] and lo it was all going over with thorns
[0:38] okay and medals if you look up medals
[0:40] the best definition I could find that
[0:42] that is useless prickly roots and we're
[0:45] all rooted in something spiritually
[0:46] speaking we're like trees and whatever
[0:48] we're rooted in is going to determine
[0:50] what fruit we produce you know and then
[0:52] we bear fruit or not and if we're rooted
[0:54] in Christ won't bear the fruits of the
[0:56] spirit but if we're rooted in other
[0:58] things will bear bitterness and strife
[0:59] and hatred and all kind of malice all
[1:02] kind of things of the world so the
[1:04] middle is a useless prickly root and
[1:08] I've got a scripture on that Hebrews 12
[1:10] follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:13] without which no man shall see the Lord
[1:15] looking diligently lest any man fell
[1:17] from the grace of God lest any root of
[1:20] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:21] thereby many be defiled
[1:23] lest of being fornicator or profane
[1:25] person as Esau who for one morsel of
[1:28] meat sold his birthright he saw was a
[1:30] very carnal man very natural carnal and
[1:33] not you know what would say life
[1:36] spiritually minded in us all
[1:38] [Music]
[1:40] Hebrews 12:12 14 then I saw him
[1:48] considered it well this is Solomon now
[1:50] he's looking at the field of this man
[1:52] and the man laying there slothful and I
[1:54] saw him in Sarah well looked upon it
[1:57] tall I mean I miss the top sorry
[1:59] go back okay so medals it had thorns had
[2:05] nails and other things he said was that
[2:07] the stone wall was broken down he lacked
[2:11] revelation you know because revelation
[2:13] is representing Scripture biased or no
[2:16] rocks
[2:16] and if we build our house upon Jesus
[2:19] said rock of salvation you know you're
[2:23] here and a doer of the word and Jesus a
[2:26] locking you into a raw Amanda Bill's
[2:28] house upon a rock the floods come the
[2:29] winds blow and the houses stand but if
[2:32] you're built upon sand and the bunks
[2:34] let's come the floods of life the
[2:36] tribulations and trials come and they'll
[2:38] you know your house will fall or the
[2:41] wind will come and wind of doctrine and
[2:42] you'll be gone you'd be fallen false
[2:44] doctrine or whatever and blown away with
[2:47] every idea so his stone wall was broken
[2:50] down ok you like revelation then I saw
[2:54] him for Sarah well looked upon it and
[2:56] received instruction a little sleep a
[2:58] little slumber a little go ahead and see
[2:59] sleep those without power to come I want
[3:02] to travel it you know if you're
[3:04] traveling here and there you're
[3:06] eventually going to be broke y'all
[3:07] really staying anywhere and a job making
[3:10] a living and that kind of thing you're
[3:12] just traveling from place to place so
[3:13] your lady will run out of money and same
[3:16] thing
[3:16] the harmed man best I could come up with
[3:19] of what that's talking about is like
[3:21] somebody who's fortified the side behind
[3:23] something man-made instead of behind the
[3:25] work of God an armed man you know ready
[3:28] for battle but not behind the shield of
[3:30] faith and behind all the armor of God
[3:41] okay God's covenant with Abraham annecy
[3:43] now if we don't just get what we asked
[3:47] for spontaneously well then there's
[3:48] nothing to it we walked back best shows
[3:51] were not seed of Abraham Abraham waited
[3:53] 25 years and was stronger at the end of
[3:56] the 25 years believing he was going to
[3:58] receive than he did the day God told him
[4:01] about it but we can't wait for one day
[4:03] to another
[4:04] oh well God you proved to me oh my what
[4:08] a weakling we are you say well promised
[4:11] Abraham he promised you - you're the
[4:13] seed of Abraham if you're in Christ
[4:14] you're the seed of Abraham every promise
[4:16] was to Abraham is under you and then if
[4:19] it not because you did this because you
[4:22] do in church because of God because but
[4:26] because God by foreknowledge elected you
[4:27] and called you to Jesus new except today
[4:31] in bowing of God that work must grow in
[4:33] order to grow it's got to be in the
[4:35] right kind of brown God Mensae promise
[4:37] and it hits that heart cannot fail Noah
[4:41] waited 120 years they've run waited 25
[4:43] years on the child of God said so and
[4:46] that settled it what is it the work was
[4:48] there being watered by faith believing
[4:50] it brought forth the results it brought
[4:52] forth the Son and brought forth the rain
[4:54] and brought forth the flood brought
[4:56] forth the virgin that was conceived
[4:59] [Applause]
[5:04] there's only one way provided by God for
[5:06] anything blood hasn't taken effect
[5:08] hasn't taken effect and you see it in
[5:10] your life as a consecrated toilet go
[5:12] with what jesus said would take place
[5:13] and be careful you might have something
[5:16] else besides the look you might have a
[5:18] little injection of theology in there or
[5:20] something a little injective sensation
[5:22] you say well I quivered I shook I danced
[5:24] I did this be careful the medicine every
[5:27] structure is good for every human being
[5:28] misled from sin they'll clean up from a
[5:30] life of sin to make a different person

[8:40] thou art the God of my salvation on
[8:44] being awake all the day and that's
[8:47] pertain to my lesson all these parts are

[8:54] thy loving-kindness for they have been
[8:58] ever a vote remember not the sins of my

[10:31] cruel hatred I'll keep my soul and
[10:35] deliver me let me not be ashamed for
[10:37] I've put trust in thee but integrity and
[10:40] upright has preserved me for I wait on
[10:42] me redeem Israel O God out of all his
[10:46] products
[11:01] [Music]
[11:03] redeem Israel so today I'm going to talk
[11:12] about patience and specifically about
[11:15] waiting on the Lord having patience
[11:18] waiting or not and my objectives are
[11:21] basically two things to recognize the
[11:23] importance of waiting on God and to
[11:25] understand that he is always faithful if
[11:27] we wait on him and other words I'm
[11:29] saying he'll bring his word the past we
[11:32] don't worry about his part our part is
[11:34] to wait on him
[11:37] so I'm gonna hang out here for a little
[11:39] while because these words a lot of words
[11:41] in this definition are very meaningful
[11:42] to me so I'm going to talk about these
[11:44] things for a little while
[11:45] this is Strong's that the mission of
[11:47] patience steadfastness constancy just
[11:51] like the inconstant endurance and the
[11:54] New Testament the characteristic of a
[11:56] man who is not swerved from his
[11:58] deliberate purpose and his loyalty to
[12:01] faith and piety his he even by even the
[12:05] greatest trials and sufferings patiently
[12:08] and steadfastly a patient steadfast
[12:11] waiting for a patient enduring
[12:14] sustaining and we've been talking about
[12:16] that perseverance that's a good one okay
[12:20] so so basically I'm going to talk mostly
[12:26] I guess I'll start off with delivery so
[12:30] deliberate means like being intentional
[12:32] and they renze go unless you're familiar
[12:34] Dave Ramsey talks about if you if you
[12:36] fail to plan your plan will fail so if
[12:40] you don't have a plan in life you don't
[12:41] have a goal and objective that you're
[12:42] striving for you won't make it
[12:44] they have a plan you're just kind of
[12:46] floating you're floating alone you're a
[12:48] double-minded I think the scripture
[12:49] cross that you can't make up your mind
[12:51] your purpose for settling this for a
[12:54] while then you can get off of that and
[12:55] go on another way I think another word
[12:58] for that but I've talked about a while
[12:59] back is fickle you know you're just kind
[13:01] of you can't make up your mind and
[13:03] constantly changing your purpose you
[13:06] like people I work with I told y'all
[13:07] about two lessons ago that are always
[13:09] changing spouses and houses and cars
[13:11] their dog and everything based then
[13:13] someone in a couple years and they're
[13:15] ready for something there but that's not
[13:17] the way to make it anywhere with God you
[13:19] have to send yourself on the Lord set
[13:22] your mind on God and just stay focused
[13:24] you keep driving straight keep going
[13:25] forward and never stop never stop
[13:28] seeking God and that's being deliberate
[13:31] that's being intentional that's being
[13:33] resolved brother Aaron students that
[13:35] song I've got it here in the end of the
[13:37] lesson if we get to it I am resolved or
[13:40] longer to wait room and a longer to
[13:42] linger I think is that something like
[13:44] that I'm resolved I like to have a
[13:46] resolve in life and there's been several
[13:48] times in my experience of life where
[13:51] I've had a resolve whether it being
[13:53] something natural or something spiritual
[13:54] that I was doing one thing and then I
[13:58] completely change directions and never
[13:59] went back whether it be that one thing
[14:02] was something that I was doing wrong but
[14:04] whatever be if you come to resolve
[14:06] you're completely set you're on a new
[14:08] path and you're not going back period so
[14:11] we have to be resolved to serve the Lord
[14:13] when I gave him a hard floor at 12 years
[14:15] old I wasn't resolved to go through with
[14:17] God and never backs down and never
[14:19] wanted to turn around everyone
[14:21] I was resolved I didn't know about the
[14:23] message I just remember tenants I just
[14:25] knew what the Baptist call didn't say
[14:27] but I wasn't going back I wasn't I
[14:29] wasn't playing around I was very sincere
[14:32] with God so you're not swerved from your
[14:37] deliberate purpose another thing I had
[14:40] an experience in my life I gave my heart
[14:42] forward on 12 but when I was 14 I
[14:44] started wanting to know more about God
[14:46] so I started reading the Bible a little
[14:48] bit I just sort of dabbled in it but not
[14:50] every single day and when I was 15 I
[14:53] realized because I can't reverse all I
[14:56] realized that if you don't make time to
[14:59] read the Bible every day it won't happen
[15:00] okay so at age 15 I was resolved and
[15:04] that's been 19 years ago I've never gone
[15:06] a day without my bubbeh reading because
[15:08] I was resolved at 15 I would never turn
[15:10] back and so that's the resolve it's a
[15:13] change of purpose
[15:14] changing your goal and you're set
[15:17] firming you're not going back and then
[15:20] there's been other things in my lifelong
[15:22] intention but in the message person
[15:25] event brother Ben talks about in the
[15:26] natural realm there's people anyone who
[15:29] has ever accomplished anything had to
[15:31] have perseverance you know they had to
[15:34] be they had to persevere that to be
[15:36] resolved and to be deliberate and
[15:38] intentional entrepreneurs that basically
[15:40] built this country made them made it
[15:42] what it is all of them had that one
[15:44] thing in common that our perseverance
[15:45] like Henry Ford all the other different
[15:48] names I haven't looked into it lately
[15:50] but all the different big names they
[15:52] basically built the country and made a
[15:54] life it is all the big businesses all of
[15:56] them had that one thing in common they
[15:58] all went for a while and fell off to one
[16:01] side or another but they were so
[16:03] resolved and so deliberate and
[16:05] intentional that they got up and they
[16:06] kept going I think Henry Ford if I
[16:09] recall that was I think I heard that was
[16:11] already a car bill he didn't build the
[16:13] first car that was already the car and
[16:15] he had to go to see the people who
[16:18] made that car because they have the
[16:19] patent to get permission I think that
[16:21] needs a built in order to build a
[16:23] parking over there I think he had he had
[16:26] to go get permission from them and they
[16:28] deferred him they said no they they
[16:29] turned him down on this and no you can't
[16:31] do it somehow he kept going and going
[16:33] and pushing and pressing until he
[16:34] finally got through and what he did
[16:37] different than a month they did was he
[16:39] built a car that everybody could afford
[16:40] because before that not everybody could
[16:43] afford a car distraction and you know
[16:46] well off to the fourth car well then he
[16:48] made a car that everybody could afford
[16:49] but he wouldn't stop until he achieved
[16:51] his goal and that's what we're gonna
[16:54] talk about everybody going to use
[16:57] anything in life has to be persevering
[16:58] and you have to have a lot of patience
[17:01] today first event patience and
[17:03] perseverance go hand in hand really
[17:04] can't have one without the other
[17:06] you have to be patient to be perseverant
[17:08] you have to be persevere
[17:10] be patient
[17:18] so why do we need patients and what do
[17:22] we have to wait for well I just listed a
[17:24] few things that are most important that
[17:26] we could talk about salvation we need
[17:28] patience to wait on God for our
[17:31] salvation
[17:31] I need patience to wait on God for our
[17:33] healing for a revelation for other
[17:36] promises of God everything of God all
[17:38] the great things in life that we can
[17:40] attain to we have to have patience and
[17:42] wait on those things because it doesn't
[17:44] come instantaneously I was diagnosed in
[17:47] 2012 13 things 2013 with the basically
[17:51] ulcers in my colon ulcerative colitis
[17:52] and I lost blood every day for
[17:55] altogether five years but you know all
[17:58] that time I think I went to go after one
[17:59] time for prayer and after that I just
[18:01] confessed my healing and I kept saying
[18:03] I'm healed well every time the symptoms
[18:05] showed up I didn't feel very healed but
[18:08] I kept saying those taking back down I'm
[18:10] healed and I kept confessing I thought a
[18:12] brother branham with that stomach
[18:13] element that he had that every time you
[18:15] hate something he'd come back up and
[18:17] that's pretty much taking you to death
[18:19] if you can't keep your food down you're
[18:21] not far from dying good you can't take
[18:23] in nutrients so he kept on confessing
[18:27] his healing and somebody ministry say
[18:29] how you doing my man saying good well
[18:30] prayers Lord and he'd be trying to
[18:32] swallow back down the further kept
[18:34] trying to come back up and find that he
[18:36] was healed he received his the
[18:37] manifestation of his name but he kept
[18:40] confessing his healing and that took
[18:41] patience and me waiting five years for
[18:45] my healing to be manifest and I'm played
[18:47] well today about the way I'm gonna
[18:48] mention that as of 2018 I had no more
[18:51] symptoms only two three ever since I'm
[18:53] not a single other problem
[18:58] and it was hard because here's this the
[19:01] devil hanging over my head by the way
[19:02] this is hereditary he kept telling me
[19:04] you know your grandfather died not of it
[19:07] but he thought with it how I hear of him
[19:09] and I agonizing pain in the bathroom
[19:11] they're screaming because of the cramps
[19:14] and the clothes had caused him and my
[19:17] sister to diagnosed with Crohn's I think
[19:19] that's something similar I don't know
[19:21] exactly what is some kind of sort of man
[19:23] when she was 12 and she's 36 now and
[19:27] still struggling the problems she's had
[19:29] for money here so the devil kept hanging
[19:32] that over my head I say you know what
[19:33] Satan I'll care for my family right
[19:45] so I mean nothing God can't do someone
[19:48] going from the devil things that over
[19:49] your head this if you got an element
[19:51] just say you know what I'm here it's not
[19:53] my safe
[19:53] you just stand right there if symptoms
[19:55] or no symptoms it's just like temptation
[19:57] when you're dealing with salvation this
[19:59] picture saved they're still gonna have
[20:01] temptations
[20:01] you just keep confessing you're saved
[20:03] and don't stop all those things though
[20:07] require patience waiting is very
[20:11] contrary to human nature we want us to
[20:14] gain things in life quickly without
[20:15] difficulty that's just in the natural
[20:18] life unfortunately the same is true for
[20:20] Christmas we want to profess to be
[20:22] mature Christians but not with but
[20:24] without any growing pains trial or
[20:27] sufferings so basically we want to say
[20:29] we're up here and the headstone just
[20:31] because we came in the message well I
[20:33] saw that to make the confession but you
[20:35] know but don't stop seeking God all the
[20:37] way and just keep pressing through and
[20:38] seeking God consider the characters in
[20:41] Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress I guess
[20:44] mostly already filming progress you have
[20:46] an hour highly recommended
[20:48] read it slow and preferable and
[20:50] capitalists that's very scriptural very
[20:52] very based in the Bible and it has to do
[20:56] with our natural journey or spiritual
[20:58] journey as a Christian there's a lot of
[21:00] all the characters that's introduced how
[21:02] the name pretended to what they
[21:04] represent and basically just just have
[21:08] to read the book it's all I can say by
[21:10] many characters in the book they bypass
[21:12] the wicked gates was the entrance into
[21:14] this salvation during the program was on
[21:17] that Christian was on and they came in
[21:21] their own way to salvation only to fall
[21:22] away later on so the point is we have to
[21:26] persevere we have to come the right way
[21:28] God's proper provided way and and and
[21:33] have patience and wait on God James 1
[21:37] verse 2 my brethren count it all joy
[21:39] when you fall into divers temptations
[21:42] knowing this that the trying of your
[21:45] faith worketh patience but let patience
[21:47] have for perfect and I put in their
[21:49] complete work that you may be perfect
[21:52] and entire wanting nothing
[21:55] so you're mature efficiently they're not
[21:57] lacking anything that's what wanting
[21:58] nothing's you're not lacking anything to
[22:01] perfection to completion as a Christian
[22:07] I want to pull that up James gone that's
[22:11] a really good one to read
[22:23] James sermon of God and of the Lord
[22:27] Jesus Christ to the twelve trials which
[22:29] are scattered abroad greeting my brother
[22:31] encountered all joy when you fall into
[22:32] divers temptations knowing this that the
[22:35] triangular face worketh patience but let
[22:38] patience have her perfect work that she
[22:41] may be perfect in attire one to nothing
[22:42] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[22:45] God that giveth to all men liberally and
[22:48] a rightist not and it shall be given him
[22:51] but let him ask in faith nothing
[22:54] wavering that's what I'm talking about
[22:56] persevere going wavered from open side
[22:58] beside this people stay straight first
[23:00] keep moving on and keep believing for he
[23:05] that waver at this life away to the sea
[23:07] driven with the wind and tossed her let
[23:09] not that man think that he shall receive
[23:11] anything of the Lord a double minded man
[23:16] is unstable in all his ways now look I
[23:18] think I looked at up the other day
[23:20] that's something to do is like you know
[23:21] you're not set on any certain purpose
[23:23] you know you're just thinking one way
[23:25] for a while then you start going another
[23:26] way you're a double minded let the
[23:30] brothers low degree rejoicing that he is
[23:32] insulted but the rich and that he is
[23:34] made low because as the flower of the
[23:37] grass he shall pass away where the Sun
[23:39] is no sooner risen with burning Heat by
[23:43] the withereth the grass and the flower
[23:45] thereof falleth and the grace of the
[23:47] fashion of the parachute so also so the
[23:50] rich man fade away in his ways blessed
[23:54] is the man that endureth temptation for
[23:56] when his tribe he shall receive the
[23:58] crown of life which the LORD hath
[24:00] promised to them that love him let no
[24:02] man say we as tempted I'm tempted of God
[24:04] for God cannot be tempted with evil
[24:06] neither tend to see any man but every
[24:09] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[24:11] his own lust and enticed so we've heard
[24:13] this talk here there's no focus several
[24:15] years ago the four stages of death then
[24:18] when lust hath conceived the brandy
[24:22] so it's loss of conception and then sin
[24:25] and then when Santa's fans to bring
[24:27] forth death just like she lusted after
[24:29] the idea that the serpent presented to
[24:31] her then she conceived it which means
[24:34] she accepted it and the woman her mind
[24:36] first and then it brought us and course
[24:39] the natural life but also unbelief you
[24:41] know against the Word of God and that
[24:44] led to natural death and also
[24:46] spiritually being separated you know we
[24:49] thought this sin process away from
[24:51] thought it doesn't bring a student do
[24:57] not hear my blood brother every good
[24:58] gift and every perfect gift is from
[25:00] above and cometh down from the Father of
[25:02] lights with whom is no variableness
[25:04] neither shadow of burning of his own
[25:07] will begat he us with the word truth
[25:09] that we should be a kind of firstfruits
[25:10] of his creatures wherefore I'm loved
[25:13] rather and let every man be swift to
[25:15] hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the
[25:18] wrath of man worketh not righteousness
[25:20] of God wherefore lay apart all
[25:23] filthiness and superfluity of
[25:24] naughtiness and receive them with
[25:26] meekness the engrafted word which is
[25:27] able to save your souls
[25:34] but be doers of the word and not hearers
[25:36] only receiving deceiving your own selves
[25:39] for any of the a hearer of the word and
[25:41] not a doer he is like a man beholding
[25:44] his natural face in the glass 3
[25:46] beholdeth himself and goeth away his way
[25:49] and straightway forgetteth what manner
[25:51] of man he was
[25:52] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[25:54] of liberty and containment therein he
[25:56] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[25:58] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[26:01] his deed being a man among you seem to
[26:04] be religious and private not his tongue
[26:06] but deceiveth is on heart this man
[26:09] wanted him to think he returned to
[26:11] follow for God and the father is this to
[26:13] visit the fatherless in their affliction
[26:14] to keep himself unspotted from the world
[26:29] Oh
[26:33] I saw that's really small hoping to see
[26:36] a little bit that next visit from the
[26:38] seven churches brother Bentham said I
[26:40] know your faith now it does not say here
[26:43] as he did to the church and permits you
[26:45] hold my faith
[26:46] he's not talking about his faith now but
[26:48] he is commended them for their
[26:50] faithfulness but as he does he also
[26:53] mentions their patience now faithfulness
[26:56] and patience go together
[26:58] in fact patience is the outcome of
[27:00] faithfulness where it says in James 1
[27:02] the trying of your faith worketh
[27:04] patience there's also no other way in
[27:07] which to gain patience it has to come by
[27:09] the trial of faith Romans 5 tribulation
[27:11] worketh patience how high they go
[27:13] regards this not working of our patience
[27:15] is seen in James 1 4 but let patient
[27:18] have a perfect work that you may be
[27:19] perfect in attire lucky nothing God's
[27:22] will for us is perfection and that
[27:25] perfection is patience waiting on God
[27:28] and waiting for God this is the process
[27:30] of character development how highly God
[27:33] has commended these Saints of the Dark
[27:35] Ages patient has lamb led to the
[27:37] slaughter loving a faithful witness of
[27:39] God that's all they wanted of life this
[27:43] service to their Lord how great was to
[27:46] be the reward
[27:56] one reason we thought wait for God is
[27:59] because of our unbelief we really don't
[28:01] believe he can or will do what we asked
[28:03] so we try to bring things to pass our
[28:05] own way we ought to trust God and all
[28:08] things we ask for knowing that gets
[28:10] faithful and will absolutely bring us
[28:12] work of pass the supposed saying are
[28:14] there ordered my objective is to help
[28:16] y'all see that God is always faithful
[28:17] he'll do what it said we're gonna matter
[28:19] how long we have to wait he'll do what
[28:21] it says
[28:29] Hebrews 10 let us draw near with a true
[28:31] heart in full assurance of faith having
[28:33] our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[28:35] conscience and our bodies washed with
[28:38] pure water let us hold fast the
[28:40] profession of our faith without wavering
[28:41] for he is faithful that promised
[28:46] Ephesians 3 now unto him that is able to
[28:49] do exceeding abundantly above all we ask
[28:51] or think according to the power that
[28:53] worketh in us unto Him be glory in the
[28:55] church by Christ he is but all ladies
[28:57] role without him
[28:59] okay from the staff roof man Brett now
[29:01] brother Brown I was talking about the
[29:02] scene in Acts true except for two in the
[29:05] upper room no no no we ain't got it yeah
[29:09] because he said there will come what
[29:12] would take place in the last days with
[29:14] stammering lips other tongues will I
[29:15] speak to those people and this is the
[29:16] rest that I said I was there 28 so this
[29:19] is it you'll get it when we'll know when
[29:23] it comes well know when it comes what of
[29:24] it promise of the Father there he waited
[29:27] nine days so they were patient and
[29:29] waiting in the upper room when the
[29:31] temptation was there for them to go on
[29:33] out saying we have it now let's just go
[29:35] on they had to sit there and wait
[29:37] patiently for God that's a long time you
[29:39] know sit there wait four days and then
[29:42] on the tenth day we were there and that
[29:45] patience away now if you got that kind
[29:49] of patience after God gives you a
[29:51] promise you've seen in the Bible it's
[29:53] mine then wait then if you got back
[29:56] final patients add it to your face and
[29:58] see how high you're getting now you're
[30:00] getting way up there now
[30:10] I froze up
[30:23] hang on
[30:37] okay well can you all see that I might
[30:41] have to do it from here I don't know why
[30:42] it's doing that
[30:43] Isaiah 40:31
[30:54] I've had but they that wait upon the
[30:56] Lord shall renew which means to change
[30:58] for better and strong spurring means to
[31:01] renew means to change for better their
[31:03] strength power of God
[31:05] they shall mount up with wings as Eagles
[31:08] they shall run and not be weary and they
[31:10] shall walk and not faint
[31:19] yeah
[31:23] Hebrews 10:26 for he I mean of patients
[31:27] that after you've done the will of God
[31:29] you might receive why to do that this is
[31:36] actually working off my cell phone so
[31:37] maybe I don't have a signal
[31:38] good
[31:48] yeah there we go
[32:00] hi for you have need of patients that
[32:03] have you've done the will of God you
[32:05] might receive the promise we're getting
[32:07] a little while and he that shall come
[32:09] will come and will not tarry now the
[32:12] just shall live by faith but if any man
[32:14] brought back my soul shall have no
[32:15] pleasure in him but we are not of them
[32:17] who draw back in the provision but of
[32:19] them that believe
[32:20] - or unto or towards the saving of the
[32:23] soul which is to means like the journey
[32:25] you know we continue on the journey were
[32:27] not drawing that were not deterred from
[32:29] our purpose work on free the testimony
[32:34] of the true witness
[32:35] we need a waiting on God to the Holy
[32:37] Ghost comes with the power of
[32:39] deliverance we need salvation it's not
[32:41] evangelist when these salvation we can
[32:44] take this mountain
[32:45] who is that mountain before thurible it
[32:47] will be like a claim
[32:49] God said remain in the land you know
[32:51] brother Dale has increased a lot about
[32:53] salvation we've heard love people here
[32:55] later talking about just plain old
[32:57] simple salvation and we need that when a
[32:59] mr. Brandt playing all several gospel
[33:02] and that God over something new
[33:04] smoking works the original seat that's
[33:07] what crisis has found good wait that's
[33:09] what's the matter people today they
[33:10] can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to
[33:12] take the church in position we've got to
[33:15] manufacture something work up something
[33:16] initially I've been speaking in tongues
[33:18] to get more members in the church all
[33:20] this kind of tommyrot instead of waiting
[33:23] upon the Lord for the real manifestation
[33:25] of the resurrection of Christ it's
[33:27] making himself known among our people
[33:30] hear his voice brother Graham said we
[33:34] don't have time to hear the voice of the
[33:37] Lord and those who do claim to be
[33:38] Christians just kneel down of a little
[33:41] prayer like this some kind of homemade
[33:42] or bless me and my family take care of
[33:44] us
[33:44] good night and the next morning rise up
[33:46] and say just guys to the day a good day
[33:49] which will wait on the Lord you see we
[33:51] do all the talking we don't give him a
[33:53] chance to talk back to us and if we
[33:55] would pray and French our soul comes to
[33:58] the presence of God and then just relax
[34:00] and listen to his voice but there's so
[34:02] many voices today this takes the voice
[34:04] of the Lord away from us
[34:14] [Applause]
[34:16] the hours calmer the Venice said well
[34:18] that's where we missed the blessings
[34:21] were afraid to wait on God just a bit
[34:23] see you've heard that only wait again I
[34:26] hear that whisper only way it won't be
[34:28] very long even now the father's hand is
[34:31] pleading soon with Jesus we will sing
[34:33] the victory song that's right just wait
[34:34] on God believe it confess it stay with
[34:37] it and God Levant to pass through you
[34:40] now here's more don't wanna interject
[34:42] because I don't want to be misunderstood
[34:44] when you say wait or rest it seems like
[34:46] maybe a lot of people might think that
[34:48] means doing nothing and I'm not saying
[34:50] don't do anything you can be seeking God
[34:52] while you're waiting on God to move you
[34:54] up in Revelation and or for healing or
[34:57] whatever you know just keep believing
[34:59] the patient away but never stop seeking
[35:02] God father's 24 mrs. Solomon all right I
[35:06] went by the field of the slothful and by
[35:09] the vineyard of the man void of
[35:10] understanding and lo it was all grown
[35:12] over with thorns and nettles had covered
[35:14] the face the road and the stone wall
[35:16] thereof was broken down then I saw
[35:19] unconsidered it well I looked upon it
[35:21] and receive instruction get a little
[35:23] sleep a little slumber a little folding
[35:24] of the hands to sleep so so that poverty
[35:27] calm as want to travel it and I want as
[35:30] an armed man this is the best picture I
[35:33] could find on the internet to represent
[35:36] what solomon looked at so here's a
[35:38] slothful man laid down sleep he's got a
[35:40] field behind him all right now that
[35:42] field has potential to grow a crop he
[35:46] could sow porn he could sow wheat and if
[35:49] he would cultivate it and work it and
[35:51] make sure it's watered and protect it
[35:52] you know surrounded with a bill the
[35:54] hedge around a stone wall to protect it
[35:57] from critters and from winds and from
[36:00] whatever else may come upon it he would
[36:02] have a good crop now that represents the
[36:05] womb of our mind we have a womb of our
[36:08] mind that we stole the Word of God in
[36:10] the name of our mind we slow down the
[36:11] word and let God come and quicken
[36:14] but we have to keep cold thing we have
[36:15] to keep studying in studying the Word of
[36:17] God and pray in a seeking God and not
[36:20] being slothful his idea was just so the
[36:22] scenes and
[36:23] lay down and sleep and see what happens
[36:25] that's not intentional that's not
[36:27] deliberate that's not patient that's not
[36:30] anything really that was your biggest
[36:32] Christians so being patient does not
[36:34] mean doing nothing I'm gonna break down
[36:37] that verse again that I've just read
[36:39] parts 24 I went by the field of the
[36:42] slothful and by the vineyard of the man
[36:44] void of understanding it did not
[36:47] understand a simple law of sowing and
[36:49] reaping he didn't understand you have to
[36:50] cultivate the field you can understand
[36:53] you have to work with feel pull the
[36:54] tears out you know and and and maybe
[36:57] spray it with whatever to keep the bugs
[36:59] off of it or whatever you know he did
[37:01] not understand the simple of all of that
[37:03] but what
