[4:30] do
[4:35] that's what I'll be willing
[4:41] into
[4:42] [Music]
[4:54] praise God amen thank you sweetheart
[5:00] that's what we want that's what a true
[5:02] believer wants God give me whatever it
[5:05] takes a man to be more like you that
[5:08] means anything anything cuz you know me
[5:11] better than I know myself
[5:13] Amen brother mark if you want to come
[5:15] take the prophet
[5:50] yes
[5:56] badly did you wanna come
[6:01] amen
[6:04] like I call I call her belly so wait
[6:07] when she was little we used to call her
[6:08] Bella belly so that's why when you hear
[6:11] me calling her I call her belly so so in
[6:18] my school I have a culinary class where
[6:25] we learn how to cook and we have a
[6:31] program every year where we have a mini
[6:34] restaurant and where we serve cultural
[6:40] food to customers and the first time we
[6:45] got our application we weren't supposed
[6:50] to get it dirty or bend it or fold it
[6:53] and the first time I got my application
[6:56] I lost it and so we printed out another
[7:03] one thankfully my teacher was able to
[7:05] provide me with another one and I was
[7:09] able to print my now and then I didn't
[7:12] get the job
[7:13] the first time but then it really made
[7:18] me feel bad because I really felt like I
[7:20] was gonna get in the first time but then
[7:23] the second time since it's close to my
[7:28] own mom's birthday the Lord provided me
[7:31] with another chance
[7:32] and I got in as a dishwasher and now my
[7:36] parents are able to come and my mom can
[7:40] come for her birthday and it just shows
[7:43] me that the Lord has just always has a
[7:47] better way for me
[7:55] just to kind of just clear she was so
[7:57] upset the first time she accepted it the
[8:01] job accepted in the job sorry for the
[8:03] Josh and so we were telling her at that
[8:05] time don't worry God has something I'm
[8:07] better a better time for you to get in
[8:09] so they had another opportunity about
[8:10] two months later to get in and she got
[8:13] accepted for the application because
[8:14] what they do is they try to teach them
[8:16] how to do when in the real world to go
[8:18] imply for a job and everything like that
[8:19] and so she got in this time not knowing
[8:22] that she was gonna get in they just they
[8:24] just called her and so they're gonna
[8:26] have a brazilian cuisine dinner night
[8:28] there in a couple of weeks and and my
[8:31] wife's birthday's next week
[8:32] so so so it was just in time for us she
[8:36] got in when it was my wife's birthday
[8:37] and we're planning on being there that
[8:39] night so god knows exactly the right
[8:41] time you know so amens I just wanted to

[16:41] man we come to the house of Lord let's
[16:43] see what we can see of him while we're
[16:46] standing let's all give the pastor a
[16:47] great big hand pastor appreciation day
[16:49] he's standing up right here right here
[16:57] one more time
[17:06] amen
[17:10] hey all you know what he told us though
[17:12] remember he told tells us every
[17:14] Christmas he said gifts are fine he
[17:17] should just be what I preach that's the
[17:20] that's the greatest gift that he'll have
[17:22] is this for us to see and understand
[17:26] what he's talking about that's the
[17:28] greatest gift you give them a million
[17:29] dollars and die and go to hell right but
[17:35] if you can get what he's saying it just
[17:37] may take us into a change of the body so
[17:40] that you can't put it all our amount on
[17:42] but thank God we do have pastor
[17:45] Appreciation Month but we need to do
[17:47] that 12 months out of the year
[17:48] right that paint looks good on you but I
[17:55] know it
[17:57] all righty then last time I'll come in
[18:00] on you in front everybody good to be in
[18:03] the house of the Lord and man good good
[18:07] man it's just wonderful when you start
[18:10] talking about things and Sunday School
[18:12] class and you walk up here and what do
[18:14] you do what do you do what do you do and
[18:16] and like I said listen that's got to be
[18:20] the Lord Coe that I tell you a little
[18:22] secret he and I do converse but we
[18:25] refrain from digging deep into what
[18:28] we're talking about because we don't
[18:29] want influence in each other he knows
[18:31] that so really we don't talk as much as
[18:33] you think we do you know normal things
[18:35] but as far as the word we do get into a
[18:37] few little highlights but I like what
[18:39] brother Klaus said broke laws that if
[18:41] you tell somebody that person could
[18:43] steal your fire to give it before you
[18:45] give it to the congregation we need to
[18:46] give it to the congregation and then let
[18:49] you speak back to us the man lets you
[18:51] speak back to us so that's what we're
[18:53] going to do this afternoon if you notice
[18:54] you've gotten your notes save the ones
[18:56] that Terrance gave you first for next
[18:58] Sunday when we'll get back on the seals
[18:59] for brother Dale said it was alright
[19:01] because I love this subject I love this
[19:04] subject I'll let my said I love this
[19:06] subject about the porter and the
[19:09] messenger comes the ndh because it what
[19:10] it does it clears up a lot of things so
[19:13] today we're just going to just piggyback
[19:15] on what he said you take what he said
[19:17] this morning and then let's not add to
[19:19] it let's just enhance it a little bit
[19:21] don't want to add you can't add to the
[19:22] Word of God but you can get a little
[19:24] more clarity obviously he can say it one
[19:28] way and I can say it another way and you
[19:29] get it my way or get it his way and not
[19:31] you know you understand what I'm saying
[19:32] so let's try this and see what we can do
[19:37] in our feeble in our feeble thoughts
[19:40] that we can maybe piggyback on what our
[19:42] brother Dale was talking about so maybe
[19:45] give a little more clarity
[19:46] I thought we he said he may do it next
[19:48] Sunday but I thought we got seven days
[19:50] and sometimes the devil likes to take
[19:52] and pull all that out of you right but
[19:55] let's get it fresh you've already had
[19:57] your mind on this morning so let's just
[19:58] kind of freshen it up a little bit this
[19:59] afternoon so let's turn to the book of
[20:01] John we're gonna shift gears big time
[20:03] from the seals now but still this has
[20:04] got a lot to do with the seal this tells
[20:07] you the placing of the seal amen this
[20:10] will tell you the
[20:11] facing of the ceiling we got you got you
[20:13] chart in front of you did everybody get
[20:14] one
[20:15] everybody got a chart and some of you
[20:17] got the quotes but the quotes will be up
[20:19] on the on the screen and and to just
[20:23] give you a note when Joe pulled these up
[20:26] I did this in 2007 this is a 2007 and
[20:31] now it's 2018 so 10 years later we've
[20:34] had just a little gap so we're gonna try
[20:36] to fill the gap in a little bit you know
[20:37] we've we've all learned a little bit
[20:39] more than we did in 2007 course brother
[20:41] Dale preached a way before then it meant
[20:44] so this is just you know he was we were
[20:48] talking about we were talking the other
[20:50] day going the hunting club and and I
[20:52] told him I said it's it's just it's not
[20:58] a miracle it's God that he hadn't had to
[21:01] change this doctrine over 50 years but
[21:04] I'm telling you know how important the
[21:06] seals are the seals were that important
[21:07] when they opened to him in 1982 I'm
[21:11] gonna say this
[21:12] there was no false doctrine in that
[21:13] there was nothing to have to to back up
[21:18] on once God opens these sails to you
[21:20] there's nothing to back up on same way
[21:23] we're brother branham yeah you know when
[21:25] he come to the opening the seals he knew
[21:26] where he was that he knew what he was
[21:28] talking about and he knew what was going
[21:30] on so that's one of the seals to me are
[21:32] very important let's turn to John 10 and
[21:34] let's read and let's talk a little about
[21:37] a bit about about the porter put it in
[21:39] Scripture then we're gonna put it on the
[21:41] chart and then we're gonna let brother
[21:42] branham take us through the through the
[21:45] message is that Alright say ma'am ma'am
[21:48] God got a good full house today so and
[21:51] it's hot up here too I'm sweating
[21:52] already John 10 verse 1 well this is
[21:55] that time of the year when the outside
[21:56] school and air conditioners don't come
[21:58] own and back and forth and back and
[21:59] forth so be glad when we can walk out in
[22:01] the new city and just don't worry about
[22:04] it yeah you just think it and it becomes
[22:09] that temperature well I love that just
[22:11] thinking Justin I wish it was 65 degrees
[22:14] John 10 first one in let's pray before
[22:17] we get started dear lord thank you for
[22:19] today thank you for the opportunity we
[22:21] have to be here thank you for a pastor
[22:23] that we can depend on Lord
[22:25] but it is all on you you are the author
[22:29] and finisher of our faith if we put our
[22:32] trust in you Lord then you'll never fail
[22:34] us
[22:34] you'll never lead us wrong you'll never
[22:38] lead us in error the Father we
[22:40] appreciate that we ask you to Lord that
[22:43] you'd forgive us of our sins and
[22:44] mistakes we made during the week that we
[22:47] call sin Lord that just disbelief in you
[22:50] Lord it's what causes a lot of things
[22:53] Lord we pray that our belief and our
[22:55] faith would be raised to a higher level
[22:57] to where Lord even when you walk down
[23:00] the street one day and a dead child
[23:04] combine the funeral procession and
[23:06] you've stopped and touched the child and
[23:08] the child come to life you didn't have
[23:12] to scream and holler and call on God you
[23:14] were God and you raised those that those
[23:17] people from the dead Lord without even
[23:19] raising your voice why because the power
[23:22] was there behind it it was the power
[23:25] behind the voice it's what makes the
[23:28] devil tremble Father give us this day
[23:31] our daily bread be with the ones that
[23:32] are not here that are sick some of
[23:34] theirs traveling Lord we pray that you'd
[23:36] be with them Lord just settle our mind
[23:38] keep us Lord always in your will bless
[23:41] the missionaries on the foreign field
[23:43] give them fruit for the labor Father in
[23:45] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[23:48] John 10 verse 1 says verily I say unto
[23:50] you he that entereth not by the door
[23:53] into the sheepfold but climbeth up some
[23:54] other way the same as a thief and a
[23:56] robber he then enter in by the door is
[23:59] the Shepherd of the sheep now jesus said
[24:01] white I am the door I am the way the
[24:03] truth and the life right to him the
[24:05] porter openeth and the sheep hear his
[24:08] voice and he calls his own sheep by name
[24:10] and leadeth them out and when he put it
[24:13] forth his own sheep he goeth before them
[24:16] and the Sheep follow him for they know
[24:20] his voice and a stranger will they not
[24:22] follow but will flee from him for they
[24:25] know not the voice of strangers this
[24:27] parable spake Jesus unto them but they
[24:29] understood not what things they were
[24:31] which he spake unto them jesus then said
[24:33] unto them then said Jesus unto them
[24:36] again very rarely I saying to you
[24:38] the door of the sheep you may be seeding
[24:41] the lure - blessing to the reading the
[24:42] word now let's talk them in about the
[24:45] porter now the porter if you are able to
[24:51] and I know some of you may have went to
[24:54] something besides the motel 6 when you
[24:57] go somewhere you know they don't have
[24:58] Porter's but if you go to a rich the the
[25:00] ritz-carlton and all those places they
[25:02] have a guy named up called a porter
[25:04] remember he stands at the door he's got
[25:06] the top hat on a lot of times and he's
[25:07] standing there in a three-piece suit
[25:09] well he's just not standing there for
[25:11] window dressing he has a job and what's
[25:16] the first thing you do you say sir where
[25:20] do I go
[25:21] well the Porter's job is as to have I
[25:24] want you to get this now the Porter's
[25:26] job is he is not some Joe Blow that they
[25:29] hired off the street yesterday and put
[25:31] him in front of the door no the porter
[25:33] he's been all into every room in the
[25:36] hotel
[25:37] he's been where the where the restaurant
[25:39] is he's been to where all the restrooms
[25:41] are he's been he knows that place like
[25:43] the back of his hand because he's been
[25:45] there he went and visited everything
[25:49] inside that hotel and then he stands at
[25:52] the door and when you say ok where is
[25:55] the restroom he says ok you go two doors
[25:57] down turn down the hallway turn left he
[25:59] doesn't have to go in there to take you
[26:01] he tells you because he already knew
[26:03] what it was in there where it was amen
[26:06] so that's what a porter is that's what a
[26:08] church age messenger in is but that's
[26:11] also what our pastor is in different
[26:13] ones that stand at the door now remember
[26:16] they something that stands at the door
[26:17] and don't go in and won't let you in
[26:19] amen we're not talking about that porter
[26:21] today we're talking about the porter
[26:22] that when you ask him a question he
[26:24] knows because he's already been there so
[26:27] that porter opens the door and lets you
[26:29] in why because he knows the door he
[26:32] knows what's behind the door so that's
[26:34] why Jesus was talking about the porter
[26:36] to him the porter openeth what the door
[26:38] and the sheep hear his voice and he
[26:41] calls his own sheep by name and leadeth
[26:43] them out because remember we're all
[26:45] sheep all of us we're all sheep and we
[26:48] have to be led then jesus tells them he
[26:51] said I am the
[26:52] or of the Sheep I'm the door but the
[26:54] porter is the one that introduces come
[26:58] in this is what you get at the Ritz
[27:00] Carlton come in this is what you get it
[27:01] wherever you want to wherever you want
[27:03] to say amen
[27:05] and don't forget the tip the porter
[27:07] either pay your tithe just thought I'd
[27:11] throw that in there for a minute but
[27:13] yeah don't let the guy just stand there
[27:15] starve to death
[27:16] give him some money give him a little
[27:19] sleepy below ten every once in a while
[27:20] or a hundred a hundred hey yeah hey man
[27:28] so now let's pull up the chart and let's
[27:31] kind of go through what we keep in mind
[27:33] what brother Dale's been talking about
[27:35] like I said I've ever told you I love to
[27:37] do this okay all right you don't have to
[27:43] give me the bottom of that can you give
[27:44] me the bottom of that to where it says
[27:48] messenger to the aged can you so this is
[27:53] what brother Dale is talking about no we
[27:55] know these are the church ages right
[27:57] these are the church ages and then these
[28:00] are the open door but what we're going
[28:02] to do is read because I want to I want
[28:04] to kind of bring something to light
[28:06] brother Dale has been talking about this
[28:08] but let's read it stay right here now
[28:10] let's go to the first seal and watch
[28:13] what the angel does cuz we got to get
[28:15] the angels right and what they do before
[28:18] we can show their message amen
[28:21] all right so now let's read in the first
[28:24] seal let's go do it
[28:25] the first seal let's just read let's
[28:29] just read what brother Branham says
[28:30] about the number one on the first seal
[28:31] they had to man we had to put this thing
[28:33] together real quick because obviously I
[28:35] wasn't gonna do it but pull up the first
[28:38] seal paragraph 126 the first quote
[28:48] thank you got it now all right look
[28:52] now notice but it's to be revealed when
[28:55] the lamb leaves is in as the
[28:56] intercessory place from the father and
[28:58] we get on here and read it
[28:59] that's revelations five they taste a
[29:01] book of seals the book of seals of the
[29:03] book seal with seal breaks him then
[29:05] shows them look at the end of the age
[29:07] now at the end of the age all right if I
[29:11] got that after the accessory is over the
[29:14] church age has done finished he come in
[29:17] the first days the Ephesian is revealed
[29:19] sent the messenger notice what happened
[29:22] as we go along here's the plan of it now
[29:25] this is the prophet of God here's the
[29:27] plan of it first thing happens there's
[29:29] an announcement in the heavens first
[29:31] what happened a seal is open what is
[29:35] that a mystery is unfolded each church
[29:38] age messenger had a mystery to unfold
[29:42] all right
[29:43] what happened a seal is open what is
[29:45] that a mystery is unfolded see and when
[29:48] a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sound
[29:51] it declares a war now that's the
[29:55] spiritual war right or a plague falls
[29:58] and a church age open see what is the
[30:01] war part remember brother Dale has been
[30:05] preaching that it's not only
[30:06] condemnation that a prophet brings he
[30:08] brings condemnation but he also brings
[30:09] grace all right so what's brother
[30:12] Branham the ant what is the war part the
[30:14] angel of the church catches the mystery
[30:17] of God Luther catches the just shall
[30:18] live by faith not fully yet revealed but
[30:23] when he does he catches this mystery of
[30:25] God and then he goes forth to the people
[30:28] he's got to get the mystery first then
[30:30] he gives it to the people
[30:31] the porters got to know what's behind
[30:32] the door before he can tell you what's
[30:33] behind the door amen so he's got to be
[30:36] first partakers of the fruit goes forth
[30:38] to the people what does he do there he
[30:40] begins to proclaim that message and what
[30:43] does it start a war a spiritual war
[30:46] remember when brother Brown started his
[30:47] message the real message 63 owned after
[30:52] the seals when he started that message
[30:54] it was a spiritual war people left him
[30:57] by the towel
[30:59] right it was a spiritual war and then
[31:03] keep going up to the next one and then
[31:08] God takes his message with the elect of
[31:10] that age lays them away asleep and then
[31:13] he drops a plague upon those whose
[31:15] rejected it
[31:16] a temporary judgment then after that is
[31:20] over then he goes on they denominator
[31:23] and bring in denominations and start off
[31:25] with that men's work like Wesley and all
[31:27] the rest of them then he gets all in a
[31:29] scrapple again and another mystery comes
[31:32] forth then what happens another
[31:34] messenger arrives on earth for a church
[31:36] age then when he arrives he sound in
[31:39] other words the trumpet sounds he
[31:41] declares war and what happened finally
[31:43] then he's called away then when he's
[31:46] laid away then plague fall destroys them
[31:49] spiritual death hits the church and
[31:51] she's gone that group then he goes on to
[31:54] another now pull the chart back up
[31:56] please we're gonna be toggling back and
[31:58] forth between the chart so when when a
[32:02] church age is announced there's a
[32:04] messenger already there for to catch the
[32:06] mystery of God he rebukes the previous
[32:10] age hook number one look at your truck
[32:12] looking through what you got in your
[32:13] hand he condemns the world just by being
[32:16] here he condemns the world he rebukes
[32:19] the previous age from what from falling
[32:22] away from the first message they had and
[32:26] then he brings his message that's why
[32:29] Paul had to rebuke the Orthodox their
[32:31] brother del song in this morning and
[32:33] then bring his message to Ephesus we're
[32:36] now coming toward the end of the Ephesus
[32:38] now remember Paul dies in a t56 or
[32:42] something or 66 or something he's not
[32:44] here so what is it it's the people it's
[32:47] the people that catch his division or
[32:52] catches the mystery and the preachers
[32:54] carry it on and that because look even
[32:57] in Calamba he did I don't I think he's
[32:59] the one that died before the age even
[33:01] began but his message was carried on for
[33:04] 1500 or over a thousand years his
[33:07] message was carried on by the people
[33:09] somebody caught the revelation of what
[33:12] the man was
[33:12] about that all right you'll see in a
[33:14] minute as it goes on now that's why in
[33:17] the days of the voice of the seventh
[33:18] angel we can also send the days of the
[33:21] voice of the first angel now you can't
[33:24] go all the way through and say the
[33:26] mystery will be finished because Paul
[33:27] didn't finish all the mystery but when
[33:29] Paul when Paul came on the earth what do
[33:32] you do he condemned the world just by
[33:34] being there he rebukes the previous age
[33:37] he rebukes to the Pentecostal age that
[33:39] came in this would be ad 30 about right
[33:42] here when the day of Pentecost right
[33:45] then he brings his message to Ephesus
[33:48] well now he dies they come in and start
[33:51] preaching and then what happened
[33:53] Satan comes in one of them horse riders
[33:56] comes in and he erodes the truth down to
[34:00] here Irie Gnaeus picks it up right here
[34:05] the rebukes the previous age condemns
[34:10] the whole world for even being here
[34:12] rebukes the previous age then he brings
[34:14] his message to some Erna now that
[34:18] continues on as we go down through there
[34:20] but remember what brother Dale read in
[34:23] Leviticus 25 8 Leviticus 25 8 is seven
[34:27] times seven right seven seven seven
[34:31] seven seven seven seven seven times
[34:34] seven seven Church ages time the church
[34:36] ages is 49 that's 49 that's that's two
[34:42] hear that okay now they never and I
[34:48] didn't understand this till later home
[34:50] until I started studying it Leviticus 25
[34:54] 8 they celebrated every seven years but
[35:00] what the problem was is on the 49th year
[35:02] they were to declare a Jubilee a new
[35:05] Jubilee a 50th for the next year and
[35:08] then everything went free if you owe 10
[35:12] million dollars to somebody they gave it
[35:14] back to you your account was 0
[35:17] hallelujah your account with 0 but in
[35:21] the real world those Jews never wanted
[35:23] that account to be 0
[35:24] so the real Jews never had a 50th
[35:29] Jubilee they just kept going 49 then
[35:33] what happens is is you got to remember
[35:35] because watch what brother Brown said on
[35:38] on the Daniel 7 new weeks he said it'll
[35:42] be the 70th Jubilee from according to
[35:46] Leviticus 25 8 which is thirty four
[35:49] hundred thirty years now 70 times
[35:50] seventy is how much I mean 70 times 50
[35:57] that's thirty five hundred years they
[35:59] say brother Branham was wrong no he's
[36:01] exactly right
[36:02] because on the 49th year starts the
[36:06] first year of the next 49 years
[36:09] so now take 70 70 times 49 that's thirty
[36:18] four hundred and thirty years exactly
[36:20] anyways talking about there was that you
[36:22] believe that no one ever how did you
[36:24] believe sure they would be a relief sure
[36:27] they would go free but his brother Dale
[36:29] said there's always one catch and that's
[36:32] this thing right this is the catch is
[36:35] this thing every church has had a catch
[36:38] remember brother mom said they couldn't
[36:39] get all the way out why because it was a
[36:42] seven it was released you could go free
[36:44] but if you were given something inside
[36:48] of that seven years it couldn't go free
[36:52] this you were given this and this don't
[36:56] go free under a seven and then is that
[37:00] helping to explain what's going on that
[37:03] seven seven is forty-nine now we need a
[37:06] fifty because that's the golden jubilee
[37:08] and that year was supposed to be
[37:10] proclaimed and if I old brother Colley
[37:13] fifty thousand dollars and somebody else
[37:15] told him twenty thousand dollars and
[37:17] some mail told him $10,000
[37:19] he wrote down zero because everything
[37:23] went free now the Jude the natural Jews
[37:26] will never do that because they love
[37:27] this that's why they never celebrated
[37:30] the 50th Jubilee never did in the whole
[37:33] history of time Israel hasn't it sure
[37:35] they've done the seven sevens they let
[37:37] people go free
[37:38] but they never cleared the account to
[37:40] zero that's you and I we've never
[37:43] cleared the account to zero there's
[37:45] always been one mark
[37:46] and that's the milettis boy right here
[37:48] so if we stay in this boy right here we
[37:51] continue in that we just what happened
[37:54] here
[37:54] Paul's group came in they all died then
[37:58] Iranians group come in strong strong
[38:00] strong then they died Martin comes in
[38:03] takes and rebukes Irina says people for
[38:05] falling away brings his message rebukes
[38:09] and fall rebukes and fall rebukes and
[38:11] following that folks there's not another
[38:13] circle over here you see what that says
[38:15] that says eternity so there's not
[38:18] another message for us to go down into
[38:21] the ground and then come back up giving
[38:23] it to another message or another Porter
[38:25] there is no other Porter we're done
[38:29] we're finished with the porters
[38:31] everybody all right with that say men
[38:34] that is playing that okay now let's go
[38:37] to the next quote evening now remember
[38:40] keep these three things in mind the
[38:42] messenger condemns the world rebukes the
[38:45] previous age then brings this message
[38:47] because you're going how it's going to
[38:48] be important right here right because
[38:51] who was brother branham always to
[38:53] rebuking the pentecostal always all
[38:58] right Paul now you got to remember you
[39:00] got your alpha and you got omega now in
[39:05] my other chart that I had I wrote
[39:07] Pentecost right here but we can't find
[39:09] that chart because there had to be a
[39:10] Pentecostal age right here because
[39:13] remember there's a Pentecostal age in
[39:16] your alpha Brides there's got to be a
[39:17] Pentecostal age in your mega brother
[39:19] amen all right with that you can write
[39:24] that in on yours because you can keep
[39:26] that copy that's yours that's not
[39:28] copyrighted I won't charge you down I
[39:31] promise we've used this all over the
[39:33] world but they they really enjoyed this
[39:35] we did this in Jamaica about mobile or
[39:37] 10 years ago or longer and brother Keith
[39:39] in them still we're talking about the
[39:41] other day that they still had the
[39:43] message that I preached in 2006 I
[39:46] believe it was they still had the quotes
[39:48] that's how they hold on to stuff we just
[39:52] kind of talk
[39:52] are here and there but they still had
[39:55] them after 12 years or 10 years ever how
[39:57] was it still talking about it some but
[39:59] it will help you if you'll pay attention
[40:01] evening light message paragraph 79 each
[40:05] messenger has had his message and the
[40:08] message and the messenger of the age and
[40:10] it was most remarkable that each
[40:11] messenger we even found in the church
[40:13] ages tonight will go back into the
[40:15] Testament Old Testament finest the same
[40:18] way this is 1963 after the seals that
[40:20] God sends the messenger of that age at
[40:23] the end of the time always at the end
[40:26] never at the beginning at the end
[40:30] now as Luther's age faded out Wesley's
[40:33] came in and when Wesley sanctification
[40:36] faded out Pentecostal age come in
[40:39] everybody see that
[40:41] Pentecostal age came in as always the
[40:43] messenger opens up the new message at
[40:46] the end of the old there by right will
[40:49] that say Amen it is it's of each age
[40:53] that that's been done and we know that
[40:56] it's the truth all right now let's
[40:59] continue on paragraph 81 excuse me this
[41:02] is a repeat this is repeated each time
[41:05] through the Bible we find that in the
[41:08] sacred scriptures all the way through
[41:09] that just at the ending of the old age
[41:11] the new one coming in that age fades out
[41:14] and the new age comes in God sends the
[41:17] messenger now remember I told you in
[41:19] brother Branham talks about a lap over
[41:20] these church ages that you see on your
[41:23] chart should be like this not like that
[41:27] but for clarity the Prophet drew it and
[41:30] God drew it so that's the way to do it
[41:32] but if you have a lap over then your
[41:34] ages should lap like this then all right
[41:38] and as always every time the messenger
[41:41] comes is always a callback to the word
[41:44] cuz that's what got you away you got you
[41:47] you got away from the word so they were
[41:49] calling you back to the word it's always
[41:53] the call back to the word never fails
[41:54] remember this is the complete revelation
[41:56] of Jesus Christ
[41:58] there cannot be nothing added to it or
[42:00] taken from it it's the complete
[42:02] revelation of Jesus Christ in the only
[42:04] way they can ever will be sure if you
[42:06] thing rises up that's contrary to this
[42:08] revelation then it's wrong pretty sure
[42:12] of yourself huh I say the same thing
[42:15] Amen now let's go to countdown mmm
[42:20] but now something else has happened we
[42:22] got an astronaut now John Glenn was our
[42:24] first astronaut find out that that's so
[42:27] far above the airplane airplane can only
[42:29] go as far as there's pressure and so
[42:30] forth but this is by an atomic power a
[42:34] greater power that presses him so much
[42:35] higher than an airplane an airplane even
[42:38] even isn't in it that's right he's been
[42:41] able to do it now we got an astronaut
[42:43] natural agent so I put that in there
[42:45] just to say look we are up here so we
[42:49] got understanding is that we're able to
[42:51] be pressurized enough to understand
[42:53] what's going on all right there by okay
[42:55] with that say ma'am
[42:56] all right now let's go to the Laodicean
[42:59] Church age we got a lot of quotes here
[43:01] but I want you to I want you to realize
[43:04] that this is not some something that
[43:07] brother Dale hatched up several years
[43:08] ago no this is what brother Ralph
[43:10] preached in the 50s and the 60s so it's
[43:13] not something new the angel of this
[43:17] Laodicean church they ended up now we be
[43:19] he will be at the end of the age now
[43:25] what age is he gonna be at the end there
[43:27] of all right because I'm telling us what
[43:32] he said he'll be at the end of the age
[43:34] like the rest of them locked the Bible
[43:37] he'll be at the end of the age that's
[43:39] like brother Dale when he said he said
[43:40] if you put brother around him right here
[43:42] that's the beginning of the age no no
[43:48] that's not true he'll be at the end of
[43:51] the age not at the first of it at the
[43:52] end of it because the angel always comes
[43:55] to rebuke them for what they done to the
[43:58] angel church allowed to steal write
[44:00] these things to the Angel Church of
[44:01] Smyrna write these things each one is to
[44:04] the angel at the end of the age Paul the
[44:08] end of the age and on down end of the
[44:10] age Delap over he's talking about what
[44:11] we talked about the leftover into the
[44:14] age into the age that's what makes it
[44:16] loud what makes it laugh is is this
[44:19] messenger
[44:20] on the scene while that church age is
[44:22] still going on that okay that age is
[44:26] still going on
[44:28] the messenger drops into that put into
[44:30] that slot but he still got people that's
[44:32] in that church age that he's got to deal
[44:35] with and there's some that's left their
[44:37] first love they some dis left what that
[44:39] messenger brought amen and that's what
[44:41] the God that's why I thought strikes him
[44:43] with a message to bring them people with
[44:47] him if he can or if you don't put a
[44:49] plague on that's what I said right the
[44:53] Lapp overseas to the angel speaking what
[44:55] it was this lapse over here to the angel
[44:58] the end of the that age see picking it
[45:01] right here made to lap like stair steps
[45:03] going up the seven church age now what
[45:06] the stair steps do they lap over each
[45:09] other that's what he's talking about so
[45:11] he's saying they do lap over each other
[45:13] all right they're not like this they lap
[45:15] over all right because we're going to
[45:18] see that when we get to this last Church
[45:20] age how they brother Brown came on the
[45:22] scene and had to lap back and pick up
[45:24] try to pick up the Pentecostal that all
[45:27] right all right now let's go to deep
[45:30] color to the deep and I want to show you
[45:32] now watch let's go back to the chart for
[45:36] a minute back to the chart okay there
[45:44] you go
[45:44] now here's Paul if I got here's Paul
[45:49] coming at the end of this Pentecostal
[45:52] age this is AD 32 ad 53 lap over in
[45:57] there somewhere here comes Paul in here
[46:00] right he was not he was not in the age
[46:06] of Pentecost but he was but he wasn't
[46:09] that messenger to them Holy Ghost came
[46:12] himself on the day of Pentecost ad 30
[46:16] right you gonna hear that no mention to
[46:19] the age so there's no messenger to this
[46:20] age a man the Holy Ghost came himself
[46:23] 120 in the upper room they got the
[46:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost now Paul
[46:28] wasn't there there was 11 there Plus
[46:31] Matthias that they put in that
[46:33] during this time because what I'm fixing
[46:36] to tell you is that Paul is going to say
[46:38] in the Bible that he was born out of due
[46:41] time he was one that should have been
[46:42] born in the Pentecostal age now I'm
[46:44] fixing to read you a quote where brother
[46:45] Branham you remember the deep collars of
[46:48] the date we've watched that many times
[46:49] the video right the video of the deep
[46:52] code for the deep that was I don't know
[46:55] where it was that but remember brother
[46:56] Brown he tells him watch what he says
[46:59] and if this ain't Paul if in st. Paul
[47:02] coming now let's go to deep colors of
[47:05] the deep no doubt in my mind but what
[47:10] there's more people millions in the
[47:12] world more worthy of the tax that
[47:13] proclaiming Jesus Christ than I am
[47:15] this is 1956 now that's in Columbia
[47:18] South Carolina but the one he did in
[47:19] Washington DC on the video he says
[47:21] basically the same thing that's true I'm
[47:24] noting the least among you I was born
[47:27] out of season among you now who's the
[47:30] full gospel Pentecost
[47:33] what was he telling him this is what I
[47:36] think brother Brown was saying I should
[47:37] have been there 1906 on his Uther Street
[47:39] with you guys but he wasn't imagine even
[47:42] to them Paul's saying I should have been
[47:45] I'm will read it to you Paul says I was
[47:46] born one out of due time I should have
[47:49] been back there with you no eat well
[47:50] he's just saying that to tell you what
[47:52] position is in I was born out of season
[47:55] amongst you four gospel people I was a
[47:58] Baptist and you more moan about the
[48:00] scripture maybe than I do but I know the
[48:01] offer real well
[48:02] and I know that he's there and I know
[48:04] who I believe and I want you to believe
[48:06] me that's why I'm here to help you all
[48:08] right now let's go to the one in
[48:11] Washington DC
[48:12] the one where we have the the video of I
[48:14] believe the prophet Daniel saw a vision
[48:17] he said he was troubled at his head many
[48:18] days is that rotten Jesus one times when
[48:20] a woman with enough faith to pull him
[48:23] around he said I perceived that virtue
[48:24] has gone out of you and people right out
[48:27] of there when it's not me Christian no
[48:29] I'm just a man chief of sinners but one
[48:31] born out of season to you full gospel
[48:34] people that's right by grace by God's
[48:38] grace he lets me call you my brother and
[48:40] sister and I love you and he talks about
[48:43] that he says the only alternative I have
[48:45] a being here what he's saying was he
[48:46] should
[48:47] should have been back there in 1906 and
[48:49] owns industry what he said born I'd do
[48:51] time now let's go to the let's go to
[48:55] first Corinthians well let's reread that
[48:58] one you read well skip that one just go
[49:00] to first Corinthians to save time now
[49:02] here's here's Paul before I delivered
[49:06] unto you first of all that which I also
[49:07] received how that Christ died for our
[49:09] sins according to the scripture and that
[49:11] he was buried and then he rose again the
[49:13] third day according to the scripture and
[49:14] then he was seen of Cephas then of the
[49:16] twelve after that he was seen of above
[49:19] five hundred brethren at once of whom
[49:20] the greater part remain unto this
[49:23] present but some have fallen asleep
[49:24] after that he was seen of James then of
[49:27] all the apostles and last of all he was
[49:29] seen of me also as of one born out of
[49:33] due time both of them replacing each
[49:38] other where they should have been
[49:40] proving there was a Pentecostal age at
[49:43] the first proving there was a
[49:44] Pentecostal age between Wesley and
[49:46] Laodicea then all right yes good yeah I
[49:57] think Frieda had a good time this
[49:59] morning she she saw some things I like
[50:02] people to see things they'd never seen
[50:03] before you know what this is all about
[50:05] amen that's what they know about being
[50:09] able to see something you didn't see
[50:10] before
[50:12] she always everybody would be that way
[50:16] ever service you'd order to get
[50:18] something amen all right listen make
[50:23] sure oh here we go sign of the time
[50:25] let's read that quote because brother
[50:26] Branham places Paul God deals for today
[50:29] what he does tomorrow's up to him he
[50:31] always deals with us with an individual
[50:34] because groups have been have too many
[50:36] ideas look even the Apostles after they
[50:39] tried to choose one because of Judas
[50:40] falling they cast lots and it fell on
[50:42] Matthias that was the best they could do
[50:45] with the keys to the kingdom and there's
[50:48] not a scripture wrote where he did
[50:49] anything but God chose Saul ill-tempered
[50:53] little fella but he had to throw him on
[50:55] his back one day and let him look up a
[50:58] while he said I'll show
[51:00] him what great things he has to suffer
[51:02] for me see the church chose my thighs
[51:04] but God chose Paul and then we're gonna
[51:08] see that the church chose dogmas instead
[51:11] of brother Branham amen that's the
[51:15] difference God always does his choosing
[51:17] his election God does that by election
[51:20] by his foreknowledge that's what's
[51:23] wonderful all right now I'm gonna read
[51:27] this quote then we're gonna pull the
[51:31] chart back up that's okay guys okay I'll
[51:34] tell you what pull the chart up some of
[51:36] you just got the thing read it let me
[51:38] read it real quick then along come the
[51:40] pink on stage with the baptism Holy
[51:42] Spirit and they kept us down on that
[51:43] brother man I mean brother Dale read
[51:44] that this morning now there cannot be no
[51:46] more ages now look there's no more ages
[51:48] the flatus in aged truly the land of
[51:52] seein age is over for us but it goes
[51:55] completely into the Millennium remember
[51:58] your old seventh-day continues into the
[52:00] Millennium the Millennium is still in
[52:03] the seventh day you don't get to the
[52:05] eighth day till the future home earthly
[52:08] but you and I are in the eighth day so
[52:11] right now but we're going to be in the
[52:12] eighth day in our body when that thing
[52:14] gets changed we're going to bring it
[52:16] here and then the world's going to
[52:18] follow behind us is that Alright that
[52:20] ought to make you happy now there cannot
[52:23] be no more ages that's all the
[52:25] Philadelphia correct itself the layout
[52:27] of CNH now we find in the study of the
[52:30] scripture that's a messenger to the age
[52:32] comes right at the end of the age every
[52:34] time Paul come at the end of the age we
[52:36] find out Iranians come at the end of the
[52:38] eighth now you think well he's just
[52:39] scattering it everywhere but watch what
[52:40] he does this when he nails it down
[52:42] Martin into the AIDS Luther the end of
[52:45] the Catholic age what wesley at the end
[52:48] of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the
[52:51] end of the Lutheran age no look and
[52:53] Pentecost at the end of the age of
[52:55] sanctification through the baptism of
[52:56] the Holy Ghost
[52:57] and at the end of the Pentecostal age
[53:00] brother Brian what are you talking about
[53:03] at the end of the Pentecostal age we're
[53:05] supposed to receive according to the
[53:07] word is God help me tonight to show you
[53:08] through here to receive a messenger that
[53:11] will take all those loose ends out there
[53:13] and reveal the whole secret to God for
[53:15] the rapture in the church at the end of
[53:20] the Pentecostal age there by right with
[53:24] that now bring the chart back up and I'm
[53:27] going to read this quote again and we're
[53:29] going to place it if that's okay just
[53:31] for a visual because you get it more
[53:32] when you visual all right when you'll
[53:34] see it now they cannot be the more aegis
[53:37] that's the layout of C&H we found the
[53:39] state of Scripture right at the end of
[53:41] the age Paul come at the end of the age
[53:43] of what pentacle we find out Iranians at
[53:47] the end of Ephesus the age Martin the
[53:52] end of the age
[53:54] now watch Luther the end of the Catholic
[53:59] age now Luther at the end now what was
[54:03] the age of Calvin that the Catholic
[54:05] Church ruled the world that's the
[54:08] Catholic age right there okay so Martin
[54:13] comes in Irina's Columba comes at the
[54:15] end here and then what Luther comes at
[54:19] the end of the Catholic age which is
[54:21] right here proving that he comes him
[54:23] he's the porter that comes in between
[54:25] takes them out
[54:28] Wesley at the end of the could you put
[54:31] that there Wesley at the end of the
[54:34] Lutheran age and what is this the age of
[54:37] sanctification is that not justification
[54:39] same casing baptismal hole god right
[54:40] this is the age of sanctification Wesley
[54:44] at the end of the Lutheran age and
[54:46] Pentecost
[54:49] at the end of the age of sanctification
[54:53] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:56] and at the end of the Penn College what
[54:59] more are you talking about brother
[55:00] Branham into the Pentecostal age that's
[55:02] what he just said all right now let's
[55:07] read the next quote did that place that
[55:10] pretty good for you we still haven't got
[55:12] to the end we got to get to the key in a
[55:14] minute but we got to get all this
[55:15] straightened out further let's go to
[55:17] questions and answers on the seals
[55:21] justification is a work of the Holy
[55:22] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[55:25] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy
[55:27] Spirit that's the reason it took a
[55:29] prophetic prophet to come down no
[55:33] messenger to the age
[55:34] now remember excuse me there was no
[55:37] messenger to the first Pentecostal aid
[55:39] it was the Holy Ghost come himself
[55:41] what's he saying right here no messenger
[55:44] to the age because the Holy Ghost came
[55:47] himself and his fullness of the baptism
[55:50] but at the end of the age
[55:54] what age that age the Pentecostal age at
[56:00] the end of the age as it always ends up
[56:03] on the other we find there than the
[56:05] messenger sent and all these scruples
[56:07] and things are placed into place then
[56:09] the rapture comes for the church thereby
[56:12] right with that now let's read a quote
[56:22] same Holy Ghost that saved the Lutheran
[56:25] they sanctified the Methodist
[56:26] now same Holy Ghost that baptized the
[56:29] Pentecostals is now setting in order the
[56:33] Pentecostal age didn't call the coming
[56:35] of the Lord no coming Lord is in this
[56:40] age it's now setting an order the coming
[56:44] of the Lord Jesus when it be so powerful
[56:46] that body will come into this group of
[56:49] church that will draw the rest of them
[56:50] from the grave there'll be a
[56:52] resurrection now that's been what we've
[56:54] been talking about on the seal that's
[56:56] what the Holy Ghost is far what is the
[56:59] Holy Ghost without us they cannot be
[57:01] made perfect they lived in one day under
[57:04] that we live in another when the enemy
[57:08] comes in like the flood out of the
[57:09] Spirit of God to raise up for standard
[57:10] when their eyes were open
[57:13] that's quote watching place this Moses
[57:18] couldn't have come with Noah's message
[57:20] neither could Jesus come with Moses this
[57:23] message see it was so it was lauded for
[57:28] each our brother Desmond tell us about
[57:31] that's true every mission remember it
[57:33] goes back to my box
[57:35] Luther's got a box Wesley's got a box
[57:38] Pentecost got a box we got a box our box
[57:43] is a resurrection but I walked watch now
[57:46] we couldn't come with Luther's message
[57:48] we couldn't come with Luther's message
[57:50] neither with Wesley neither with the
[57:54] Pentecostal message we're plumb beyond
[57:57] that we're plumb beyond that you say oh
[58:02] that's something that's something you
[58:04] will so did the Catholic Church think
[58:06] Luther was making it up
[58:08] so did Wesley thing or the Lutheran's
[58:11] think that Wesley was making it up so
[58:13] did the Westlands think that the
[58:15] Pentecostals made it up but the thing of
[58:17] it is looked back in the scripture it
[58:18] identifies every age
[58:21] all right harvest time notice closely
[58:25] don't miss this what if Moses would have
[58:29] come bringing Noah's message it wouldn't
[58:31] have worked couldn't know what if Jesus
[58:35] no this is the Word made flesh this is
[58:39] the Word made flesh German chocolate
[58:43] cake sausage biscuits with honey they
[58:51] yelled it y'all didn't put any honey
[58:53] women biscuits did you Mayan honey on
[58:56] the bacon biscuit good thought the
[59:00] rapture took bling but it didn't cause
[59:06] I'm still hungry
[59:08] but look watch pay attention this is the
[59:11] homestretch it wouldn't have worked what
[59:14] if we come trying to bring the Methodist
[59:17] message back Baptist message are the
[59:19] Pentecostal message it wouldn't work
[59:22] they were fine prove that in a minute by
[59:25] the word they were all right in their
[59:27] age that age is gone we got to find out
[59:31] what the scripture says for today this
[59:34] day that's what man is to live by for
[59:38] his age now let's read a quote that
[59:44] makes stump you a little bit but I'm
[59:48] gonna let brother Brennan tell you and
[59:52] we took the Elijah of the first run we
[59:54] took the Elijah to follow him we took
[59:55] John the Baptist after that who was the
[59:58] Elijah of that day and a promise for
[1:00:00] another in this day now John the Baptist
[1:00:02] was not the Elijah of Malachi for he was
[1:00:05] the Elijah of Malachi 3 jesus said so
[1:00:08] behold I send my messenger before my
[1:00:10] face to prepare the way we find him
[1:00:13] being that now in doing so in finding
[1:00:16] those positions we know that all the
[1:00:19] rest of the scripture inspired
[1:00:21] of God reveals to us that were in the
[1:00:24] last day now if I come with the message
[1:00:27] of Pentecost I would be in the Laodicean
[1:00:32] Church age because it stumped you a
[1:00:38] little bit this morning when brother
[1:00:39] Brown said brother on me brother nail
[1:00:40] said brother Brown wanting the message
[1:00:41] in the lab said he just said he wasn't
[1:00:45] sure he came in laodicea sure he brought
[1:00:50] a message in Laodicea sure he's the
[1:00:52] seventh angel messenger no doubt but if
[1:00:56] you don't place him right we go in there
[1:01:01] rapture
[1:01:02] well we're not taking the body change
[1:01:03] rapture just happens Raptor just happens
[1:01:05] after we take the body change like I
[1:01:08] said I'm not looking for a rapture no
[1:01:10] more am I looking for a rapture I ain't
[1:01:12] even gonna sing that song I see you in
[1:01:13] the rapture ain't saying it no more
[1:01:20] well I'm not
[1:01:22] I want something by the body change
[1:01:25] first in a resurrection then we'll move
[1:01:28] into a rapture but you won't just go I'm
[1:01:31] going in the rapture no now if I come
[1:01:34] with a message of Pentecost I would be
[1:01:37] in the letter C in church age and it
[1:01:40] wouldn't be right and it wouldn't be
[1:01:47] right that's the reason that Wesley
[1:01:50] could not take Luther's message Luther
[1:01:52] was in one a church age Wesley was in
[1:01:54] another church age as Jesus would have
[1:01:56] come the message of Moses it would not
[1:01:58] have worked if Moses would have come
[1:01:59] with the message of no it would not have
[1:02:01] work but God has allotted to his people
[1:02:04] his his people of every age of Scripture
[1:02:08] does a member brother branham has two
[1:02:13] scriptures to work with two prominent
[1:02:16] ones malachi for was to turn the hearts
[1:02:20] of the children back to the Pentecostal
[1:02:22] fathers he did that
[1:02:27] but then when the age moved on he became
[1:02:30] the messenger of this hey hello
[1:02:37] hey just said he's tonight if I brought
[1:02:40] the message to Pentecost which was what
[1:02:42] they were speaking in tongues the Holy
[1:02:44] Ghost was fallen giving them gifts
[1:02:47] brother Branham was in that movement
[1:02:49] people he was in that Pentecostal
[1:02:53] movement but he wasn't a messenger to
[1:02:54] that age the Holy Ghost was a messaging
[1:02:57] to that age to the Pentecostal age
[1:02:59] brother Branham was the messenger to the
[1:03:02] eighth day people that's being you not
[1:03:10] in the years of preparation this is the
[1:03:13] years of preparation I would be in the
[1:03:17] layout of seeing church age and it
[1:03:19] wouldn't be right
[1:03:24] there by all rights Amen all right let's
[1:03:31] go to the next one because no what
[1:03:36] happened just between the Methodists and
[1:03:39] Pentecost were going out I have said an
[1:03:41] open door he's going back to the church
[1:03:44] ages there you are the name restored
[1:03:47] again I've set an open door but I'm the
[1:03:49] way the truth and the life no man cometh
[1:03:50] father said by me what is it that open
[1:03:52] door now that open door that Luther open
[1:03:57] and that Wesley open there was doors in
[1:04:01] doors they couldn't go in there was
[1:04:04] revelation that was withheld from them
[1:04:06] because it was not for them because
[1:04:09] Luther was a Trinitarian Wesley was a
[1:04:12] Trinitarian Pentecost original was
[1:04:14] Trinitarians you can't change this body
[1:04:16] with a Trinitarian idea but God winked
[1:04:20] at ignorance the Holy Ghost fell on the
[1:04:23] people on the Zuzu Street and restored
[1:04:25] the gifts restored the Holy Ghost in a
[1:04:29] people restored the gift to the people
[1:04:32] and then and even brother Branham was in
[1:04:36] that part of that
[1:04:39] but what did he do he kept moving on
[1:04:43] I read you one a minute ago Pentecost
[1:04:46] you cabbage down now remember what I
[1:04:48] said the messenger when he comes on the
[1:04:50] scene what's the first thing he does he
[1:04:52] condemns the world America will be
[1:04:56] destroyed because brother Branham was in
[1:04:57] this in this country I guess you may
[1:05:01] call it cuz he called judgment on him
[1:05:05] because they rejected him all right but
[1:05:08] what did he do though he rebuked the
[1:05:10] previous age pull the bullet chart back
[1:05:13] up he rebuked who he didn't rebuke
[1:05:20] Wesley not did he he rebuked Pentecost
[1:05:26] for for what not going further in
[1:05:30] the revelation they cabbage down and
[1:05:34] then brother Branham in 1962-63 began
[1:05:39] his message to an eternal group of
[1:05:42] people an eighth day message
[1:05:45] my brother Dale always said read through
[1:05:47] read the titles after them
[1:05:49] the seals were open it's like I said
[1:05:52] last Sunday and I hope you got there Bob
[1:05:54] sent me a text you know I'm like brother
[1:05:56] Dale listen he know you can sit there
[1:05:59] and talk all day you won't do about one
[1:06:01] thing or another but when you bring back
[1:06:03] to him what he preaches that's what
[1:06:07] makes us happy inside when you bring
[1:06:09] back to us what we're preaching Bob sent
[1:06:13] me a text he said that door was sealed
[1:06:16] with seven seals remember Jesus standing
[1:06:18] at the door knocking he the son of man
[1:06:21] revelation was what was put out of the
[1:06:23] church not that son of God revelation we
[1:06:26] were going to get into that today but
[1:06:27] we'll get into it next Sunday upon this
[1:06:30] rock I'll build my church
[1:06:31] he built the church on the Son of God
[1:06:33] revelation but the son of man was put
[1:06:35] out of the church behold I stand at the
[1:06:37] door not what in our age he was put out
[1:06:42] it was sealed was that door was sealed
[1:06:45] with seven seals
[1:06:46] well once those seals were broke what
[1:06:47] what did I tell you why did I tell you
[1:06:50] at first
[1:06:51] the seals do not bring you the holy
[1:06:55] ghost people get the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:59] don't know what seals are and man that's
[1:07:01] the Son of God revelation right that's
[1:07:05] the Son of God revelation right but when
[1:07:11] the seven seals break
[1:07:13] that's the revelation of the Son of Man
[1:07:15] this guy and then when you open the door
[1:07:19] what did I tell you that the seals is
[1:07:21] not for your read it or not for your
[1:07:23] salvation it's what it's to restore
[1:07:27] fellowship between you and God
[1:07:29] well you know what there's a there's a
[1:07:31] door between you and God there's no
[1:07:33] fellowship there listen let me just be
[1:07:36] real honest there's no fellowship
[1:07:39] between me and Jim when she's got the
[1:07:40] door shut they might be a war I don't
[1:07:46] know why I'm looking at you boys oh
[1:07:47] there might be a war but all when that
[1:07:50] door is open and I can see that
[1:07:53] beautiful bride standing there and I
[1:07:55] know she loves me and I understand her
[1:07:57] and soonest that's what God wanted the
[1:08:00] seven seals opens the door I hope you
[1:08:07] see that anybody all right now let's
[1:08:18] read let's go on down skip it down to
[1:08:20] save for time skip down to go past
[1:08:23] brother Anderson go press the
[1:08:26] Philadelphian church age and go where it
[1:08:28] says last century aged paragraph 58 then
[1:08:36] we'll come back to the chart and we'll
[1:08:37] try to yeah but I just like to give you
[1:08:44] my quotation of what this angel will be
[1:08:46] what we're looking for
[1:08:48] would it be all right Congress says I'm
[1:08:50] in being that we got a little time I
[1:08:51] just wrote a little quotation here when
[1:08:53] I thought the angel of this layout of
[1:08:55] sin church they ended up now he will be
[1:08:57] at the end of the age amen he'll be at
[1:09:04] the end of the age like the rest of them
[1:09:06] like the Bible he'll be at the end of
[1:09:10] the age not the first of it the end of
[1:09:12] it now remember he didn't come at the
[1:09:16] end of Wesley's age or he would have
[1:09:20] rebuked the sanctification people he
[1:09:23] came at the end of Pentecost to rebuke
[1:09:29] the Pentecost and bring his message now
[1:09:33] he'll be at the end of the age like the
[1:09:34] rest of them like the Bible he'll be at
[1:09:36] the end of the age 92 first at the end
[1:09:39] because the angel always comes to rebuke
[1:09:41] them for what they done to the angel the
[1:09:43] church the latest here right these
[1:09:45] things see to the Angel Church of Smyrna
[1:09:46] write these things see each one is to
[1:09:49] the angel at the end of the age Paul in
[1:09:50] the age on down into the age lap over we
[1:09:54] read this will read again into the age
[1:09:56] that's what makes it lap so there's your
[1:09:58] lap over your stair-step
[1:09:59] all right let's go now to our favorite
[1:10:06] quote in this whole church paragraph 327
[1:10:09] lat asiye now this master of Malachi 4
[1:10:12] in Revelation is 10 7 is going to do two
[1:10:14] things one according to Malachi for he
[1:10:17] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:10:20] the father's two he revealed the
[1:10:23] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:10:24] Revelations Tim which are the
[1:10:25] revelations command and seventh seal it
[1:10:28] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:10:30] troops that literally turn the hearts of
[1:10:32] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:10:34] exactly so a man so that's the two
[1:10:37] things when brother Branham came on the
[1:10:39] earth what do you do
[1:10:42] what do you do he rebuked at Pentecost
[1:10:46] from getting away from their first love
[1:10:48] from getting away from Pentecost
[1:10:50] he brought us up to 1962 or so ish and
[1:10:54] they remember there's a lap over to
[1:10:56] everything mm-hmm you said well this
[1:10:58] mess is starting to see us well March
[1:10:59] March the third nineteen sixties no go
[1:11:03] back to spoken words original see
[1:11:04] because that's kind of where it all get
[1:11:05] started then he does statue of a
[1:11:07] birthing man blasphemous name he keeps
[1:11:11] working this way up restoration of the
[1:11:13] bride tree serves what is the time may
[1:11:16] but we did that one time on a chart up
[1:11:17] here then he brought the seal so he had
[1:11:19] there's a stair step going up to that
[1:11:21] process but the process was what getting
[1:11:24] us back to the faith of the fathers so
[1:11:27] that he could get us into an eighth day
[1:11:33] manifestation his message was a message
[1:11:39] of eternal life oh yeah his message with
[1:11:41] eternal life in the first part but those
[1:11:44] people under that administration died
[1:11:47] remember edging the questions answers on
[1:11:50] the sales he said it's gone from you
[1:11:51] it's not for you you're not to get him
[1:11:53] why they were stuck in that old
[1:11:55] Pentecostal age now look we've read this
[1:12:01] many times I'm not gonna read them again
[1:12:03] I'm just gonna tell you something
[1:12:04] brother Brown says not in the healing
[1:12:06] service the message that follows the
[1:12:07] healing service brother Dale's read them
[1:12:09] not in the healing service but the
[1:12:11] message that follows the healing service
[1:12:12] I have heard but now I see works his
[1:12:14] face to express all these his message
[1:12:17] was not to restore the gifts Pentecost
[1:12:24] restored gifts in the church I'm telling
[1:12:28] you I get a Smith Wigglesworth read his
[1:12:31] work I mean here's a man that now he
[1:12:36] didn't have a worldwide message but he
[1:12:38] was world known but he was so much of a
[1:12:41] faith healer remember the guy that was a
[1:12:44] guy that didn't have one foot his leg
[1:12:46] was cut off at his knee he told the guy
[1:12:49] he said you go down to the shoe store
[1:12:51] and he said you have your shoes
[1:12:54] fitted for both of your feet the guy
[1:12:57] looked at him kind of strange he said
[1:12:59] you do what I said and he said watch God
[1:13:02] work now here's the story the guy goes
[1:13:04] down there sits down now look he sits
[1:13:07] like this
[1:13:08] he got no leg from here down sits down
[1:13:12] they measure this shoe the guy goes and
[1:13:15] gets the shoe when he comes back there's
[1:13:16] two feet now that's a great healing
[1:13:23] campaign but Smith Wigglesworth never
[1:13:26] changed the world in his message he was
[1:13:29] still a trinitarian a man even even if
[1:13:33] at Bosworth was a trinitarian you see
[1:13:35] they all they all were stuck in that
[1:13:37] Pentecostal age to where God blessed the
[1:13:40] gifts he blessed the speaking in tongues
[1:13:41] he blessed the people but there come a
[1:13:44] time when they said this is it God said
[1:13:47] no that's not it I was just showing you
[1:13:50] this so you could get back amen
[1:13:53] so that's what brother Branham now
[1:13:54] here's my assumption bring the chart
[1:13:56] bucket here's what I see brother Branham
[1:13:59] said 1977 would be the 70th Jubilee
[1:14:03] since the beginning of Jubilees
[1:14:05] according to Leviticus 25 eight brother
[1:14:07] Dale read through Leviticus 25 eight
[1:14:09] that is seven sevens is 49 right
[1:14:15] Leviticus 25:10
[1:14:17] is a 50 that's when everything goes free
[1:14:22] that's not happened yet it has in your
[1:14:26] soul but it's not happening you complete
[1:14:29] release comes remember your 50
[1:14:31] everything goes free body spirit and
[1:14:33] soul takes the change all right here's
[1:14:36] my you say well well when did all this
[1:14:40] age end and age begin
[1:14:43] I believe the loudest in church days in
[1:14:45] 1906 began under the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:50] Ghost being the messenger to that age
[1:14:52] then brother Branham says now I'm not to
[1:14:55] mention you to lay out to see you may I
[1:14:57] just read you that so when did the
[1:14:59] Pentecostal age in I believe it was 1977
[1:15:04] there's your seven sevens it's because
[1:15:07] Pentecost is still in your seventh you
[1:15:08] said we're not allowed to see us - sure
[1:15:10] it is but we're not the message we
[1:15:13] receive is not in the seventh day the
[1:15:16] message we receive is in an eighth day
[1:15:18] because listen just be real real plain
[1:15:22] from 65 to 77 it was mass confusion for
[1:15:31] some this one's going to lead and this
[1:15:34] one's going to lead and this one's got a
[1:15:35] message and this one's got a message and
[1:15:37] you got to follow me you got to have
[1:15:39] seven thunders you got to have seven men
[1:15:41] you got to have this you got to have
[1:15:42] that they were wandering in the
[1:15:45] wilderness but in 1977 I believe people
[1:15:49] started realizing that that was gone
[1:15:52] that was the Pentecostal age that was
[1:15:55] gone because remember brother Branham
[1:15:57] was standing in 1963 he said it's gone
[1:15:59] from you you're not going to get it live
[1:16:06] a good simple Christian life but let's
[1:16:10] put a couple quotes together Reese says
[1:16:13] but somebody's gonna catch this and
[1:16:15] carry it on to the coming of the Lord
[1:16:17] same way what Paul you say well brother
[1:16:19] branham's not here in the days of the
[1:16:22] voice on the Sabbath angel Paul wasn't
[1:16:25] here during probably 10% of that church
[1:16:30] age so who carried that church age the
[1:16:33] people carried that church age the true
[1:16:35] message that Paul preached was carried
[1:16:39] by a group of people but it got to a
[1:16:41] place to where that white horse rider
[1:16:46] took off then the red horse rider took
[1:16:49] off then the black horse rider took off
[1:16:52] and now we're facing the pale horse
[1:16:54] rider which is all them spirits now now
[1:16:58] look not these spirits that's the Holy
[1:17:00] Spirit these spirits you see how these
[1:17:04] spirits have progressed and remember
[1:17:07] right here I wish y'all wouldn't put
[1:17:09] that there brother Branham remember that
[1:17:11] would know remember that was all black
[1:17:16] he said I put in a little bit of light
[1:17:19] you know what a little bit of light was
[1:17:21] me and you that little bit of light was
[1:17:25] me I wait a minute that will be like
[1:17:26] with me I don't know about you but that
[1:17:28] little bit of light was me that was the
[1:17:30] grace that God give us to understand
[1:17:32] that we are in an eighth day message
[1:17:34] we're not in a Pentecostal message sure
[1:17:37] Pentecost is wonderful but we're not in
[1:17:41] that listen I told him downstairs the
[1:17:43] son of man watch how he reacted to
[1:17:46] things in Matthew Mark Luke and John if
[1:17:49] you watch how he reacts that's the way
[1:17:51] you supposed to react but now what do we
[1:17:55] do when somebody needs healing we you
[1:17:57] know we grab them when we shake them and
[1:17:59] we pull only slap them Jesus never did
[1:18:03] that you know what I told him downstairs
[1:18:09] the Son of Man the Son of Man walked
[1:18:14] into a room and the devil started
[1:18:17] talking to him hello
[1:18:21] hey Sharon the devil started talking to
[1:18:25] him
[1:18:26] they started identifying who he was
[1:18:29] that's what I want to happen when we
[1:18:32] walk into a room I want the devil to
[1:18:34] identify self he didn't have to take
[1:18:42] legion and grab him by the head
[1:18:50] what'd he do soon as Jesus stepped his
[1:18:53] foot off that boat Legion comes up and
[1:18:57] says why are you here that son of God
[1:19:01] why are you here to torment us before
[1:19:04] our time they knew who he was
[1:19:11] sure they did so I want the son of man
[1:19:16] revelation to be that when we walk in
[1:19:18] this door the Devils are going to say
[1:19:22] can we leave please can we leave please
[1:19:28] we laugh but we all got a little devil
[1:19:30] sitting on our shoulders you know we all
[1:19:32] got little demons that we need to get
[1:19:34] rid of well when Jesus walked in the Son
[1:19:37] of Man walked in they were going hey can
[1:19:41] we just go somewhere else that's a group
[1:19:45] of pigs out there in the field you mind
[1:19:47] if we go tuck ourself in you know what
[1:19:49] Jesus he didn't say I'll but he said go
[1:19:53] go go that's the power of the Son of Man
[1:19:57] folks we hadn't got into that yet but
[1:19:59] that's the power that these seals are
[1:20:01] revealing to us that a person was
[1:20:04] standing on earth in human flesh called
[1:20:06] us on a man that was the eighth day
[1:20:09] standing because remember what day did
[1:20:12] he resurrect on first day of the week
[1:20:15] which was the eighth day he resurrected
[1:20:19] right into eternity because when he come
[1:20:22] out of that grave he was totally eternal
[1:20:28] that all right think about that that
[1:20:32] same Jesus is here that same message is
[1:20:36] here that same person that now brother
[1:20:41] Branham comes at the end of the age in
[1:20:43] 1977 we are now we were able to
[1:20:45] understand because we're now in that
[1:20:49] 50th Jubilee we are taking a release
[1:20:53] that will get us all out of here they'll
[1:20:55] take us all not in a rapture hi you
[1:20:58] thought I'd stay right you didn't I'm
[1:21:02] looking for a resurrect
[1:21:04] because we were going to get into it
[1:21:06] today where first thessalonians said
[1:21:08] what shout voice trumpet brother bottom
[1:21:14] explains every one of them week which
[1:21:17] are alive and remain shall not prevent
[1:21:19] or hinder those which are asleep for the
[1:21:21] dead in Christ shall rise first and when
[1:21:26] they come out of their graves they're
[1:21:27] not gonna half that's not what's coming
[1:21:29] out this morning
[1:21:30] listen Melchizedek when he walked up to
[1:21:32] Abraham now what in the world would you
[1:21:34] speak think of a God that walks up to
[1:21:36] Abraham hello Abraham walks up to
[1:21:39] Abraham LKC go now Abraham you're gonna
[1:21:46] be changed and I'm gonna do it my milk
[1:21:54] isn't it I'm Almighty God now I'm gonna
[1:21:58] change your body Abraham and be this
[1:22:00] like me I'd say you need to go find your
[1:22:04] rest home and bring me God cuz my guards
[1:22:09] twenty year old man my guards in the
[1:22:11] prime of his life when Melchizedek
[1:22:14] walked up to the Abraham he had a gleam
[1:22:17] in his eye he said Abraham I have come
[1:22:20] to tell you what's going to happen I
[1:22:24] have come to tell you that you go take a
[1:22:28] body change then you gonna have a child
[1:22:31] and Sarah's over going not gonna have
[1:22:36] pleasure with my husband one more time
[1:22:39] and God said now ain't nothing too hard
[1:22:41] for God with God all things that's what
[1:22:44] he said to Mary with God all things are
[1:22:46] possible
[1:22:47] listen I mean your God can't your gods
[1:22:49] that way man I believe when Joshua which
[1:22:52] is the same guys Melchizedek the one
[1:22:55] that he met now he didn't meet the
[1:22:58] captain of the host and the captain of
[1:22:59] the host was about couldn't get his
[1:23:00] sword out of his no Joshua and you know
[1:23:03] what Joshua was threatened by cuz he
[1:23:07] drew his sword and he said who are you
[1:23:09] for you force are you against us in
[1:23:12] other words he went some little Barney
[1:23:13] Fife looking thing
[1:23:15] he was probably built and he was a
[1:23:18] formidable opponent but when he spoke to
[1:23:21] Joshua and he said Joshua I am the
[1:23:24] captain of the hope I have come and take
[1:23:28] off your shoes because where you stand
[1:23:31] in this holy ground
[1:23:32] Amen that was a there was Almighty God
[1:23:36] never been out of his youth that's the
[1:23:38] oldest God's ever looked because when he
[1:23:43] resurrected he didn't look like that it
[1:23:49] was a 20 year old kid that's why I'm
[1:23:51] mayor Magdalene turned and looked and
[1:23:53] said are you the gardener she never saw
[1:23:57] him at 20 years old but when he spoke
[1:24:02] she knew that voice that's the same
[1:24:05] thing with you and I we have heard the
[1:24:07] voice and that voice is in 1,100 sermons
[1:24:11] and it's being preached around the world
[1:24:13] every day and one day we are going to
[1:24:17] get this thing right we are preaching to
[1:24:19] you the words of eternal life we're not
[1:24:28] waiting on one to come to preach and
[1:24:29] we're preaching it now who else is it
[1:24:36] coming from you say you see me no I'm
[1:24:37] not saying me but I'm saying the
[1:24:40] ministry around the world it's preaching
[1:24:41] the message of eternal life and you know
[1:24:46] what without error without error you
[1:24:50] better believe that you're sitting
[1:24:52] somewhere that there's not error being
[1:24:54] preached because your body will not be
[1:24:56] changed by error Jesus's body was
[1:24:59] changed because he was the Word made
[1:25:01] flesh if you're born again today you are
[1:25:05] the Word made flesh but you're now in
[1:25:08] the time that Daddy Elijah can come and
[1:25:11] talk to you not back then not the old
[1:25:16] order not the old not the old generals
[1:25:20] they're all gone I believe we're like
[1:25:23] Joshua the captain the hostess showed up
[1:25:25] he said I come to take over
[1:25:28] and that's what he wants to do he wants
[1:25:30] to take over you he wants to take over
[1:25:32] your body he wants to take over your
[1:25:34] spirit and I hope he's already took over
[1:25:37] your soul let's stand to our feet but
[1:25:44] the messenger comes at the end of the
[1:25:45] age there's not a church ages there's
[1:25:47] not eight messengers but there's eight
[1:25:51] manifestations to get us to an eternal
[1:25:53] message and then that all right because
[1:25:56] right here hmm
[1:25:58] I thought the headstone was to come in
[1:26:00] the end time that's what that is
[1:26:02] that's your eighth day hey man let's
[1:26:10] sing a song hope that was good it was
[1:26:14] good for me cuz I enjoy
[1:26:16] we'll get back on the seals hey we were
[1:26:18] talking on the seal just now so but
[1:26:21] we'll get into our fourth seal
[1:26:23] maybe we'll get us get us some body

[1:26:28] one yeah our dick this is where we get
[1:26:30] older brother al brother dick yeah you
[1:26:33] just keep believing buddy because God
[1:26:35] didn't welcome saying Abraham you're 99
[1:26:37] I don't think it's possible now oh no it
[1:26:40] was more impossible you know why because
[1:26:47] Abraham looked at the revelation and he
[1:26:50] saw the person he gave him the
[1:26:51] revelation was a young man but he knew
[1:26:54] he was Lord he knew he was a creator he
[1:26:57] was Melchizedek and that Melchizedek
[1:27:01] became Jesus Christ and that Jesus
[1:27:04] Christ come into you and you are now the
[1:27:10] sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
