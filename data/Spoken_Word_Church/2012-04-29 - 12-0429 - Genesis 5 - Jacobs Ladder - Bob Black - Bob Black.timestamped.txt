[0:16] last time we were looking at uh
[0:19] Genesis five
[0:21] and uh we're comparing that with
[0:26] the genealogies in Matthew and Luke
[0:30] so let's start off at just five or four
[0:37] the the theme of this lesson is going to
[0:39] be this is five that's talking about
[0:41] death because Adam sold Us in the dead
[0:43] and somehow we had to get back it's a
[0:46] lie and Matthew last time we talked
[0:49] about how Matthew Martin Luke and John
[0:50] present Christ in four different ways
[0:53] as a lion is a servant as a uh as a man
[0:57] the son of man as as uh as God
[1:01] and
[1:03] Matthew the genealogies and Matthew and
[1:05] Luke
[1:06] present him as the one that's going to
[1:08] come back to give us life that we can
[1:10] become part of him again and have return
[1:14] us to fellowship with God
[1:17] so justify think about that think of
[1:20] think of it as as the the book of the
[1:22] generations of Adam is the book of uh
[1:24] it's a testimony of what Adam lost
[1:28] this is the book of the generations of
[1:30] Adam and the day that God created man in
[1:33] the likeness of God made him
[1:37] he was made in the likeness of God and
[1:39] then he lost he lost he found out that
[1:42] he was naked when he uh took the sin
[1:45] upon himself and uh lost his privilege
[1:50] male and female created EDM and blessed
[1:52] them and called their name Adam
[1:54] and the day when they were created from
[1:56] the beginning they both went by the same
[1:58] name it wasn't
[2:00] the evil they were both known as Adam
[2:02] because he was so much a part of Adam
[2:04] that she shared his genes she shared his
[2:09] they had to
[2:10] they were they came from the same Spirit
[2:12] as he was born with his flesh bone of
[2:15] his bone flesh of his flesh
[2:21] after his image and called his name Sith
[2:25] now he was created the image of God now
[2:28] he's in a sinful statement he's uh he
[2:31] began a son in his likeness now in his
[2:34] in his sinful image and the whole thing
[2:37] with this is there's no there's no man
[2:40] today is worthy to take the book there's
[2:44] no man that is uh uh as we go along
[2:48] we're gonna
[2:49] look at genes a little bit and find out
[2:52] that there's no nobody in the
[2:55] generations of Adam that was worthy to
[2:56] take us back to into fellowship with God
[3:01] and the days of Adam after he had
[3:04] begotten himself for 800 years and he
[3:06] begat sons and daughters and all the
[3:09] days that Adam lived were 930 years he
[3:12] died
[3:13] 930 years are significant because nobody
[3:16] lived longer than Adam except from
[3:17] Methuselah who lived 969 years so think
[3:20] of this all all the way up to the flood
[3:24] with a Meg the father Miller was about
[3:26] 56 years old
[3:28] is when Adam died so Adam was a witness
[3:30] and a testimony to everyone up to the
[3:33] flood of what had happened in the garden
[3:35] all the way up to the flood you could
[3:37] have gone and spoke to Adam face to face
[3:39] and said what really happened in the
[3:40] garden
[3:41] and you could ask him questions
[3:44] all the way up right to the father
[3:48] and all the days of let's see and said
[3:51] to lived in 105 years
[3:54] and they get anus and Seth lived after
[3:57] he began Enos 807 years and we got sons
[3:59] and daughters and all the days of sets
[4:02] were 912 years and he died and Enos
[4:04] lived 90 years and we get canned
[4:06] and Enos lived after he would get Kane
[4:08] at 815 let's skip them down
[4:12] to
[4:15] you know
[4:16] verse 21.
[4:18] and Enoch left 60 in five years and
[4:21] began Methuselah
[4:24] you know find out he had a personal
[4:27] relationship with God
[4:28] because he walked with him and he can't
[4:30] walk with God if you can't walk with
[4:32] somebody unless you're in agree with him
[4:33] that's Amos 3-3 I can two walk together
[4:36] unless they be agreed
[4:40] and God gave peanut
[4:43] a revelation of something that was going
[4:45] to happen and that's why he named his
[4:47] son Methuselah when he is dead it shall
[4:49] be sinned because when Methuselah died
[4:52] but those will live until about
[4:55] 350 60 years after Noah was born
[4:59] and when he died the flood came so in it
[5:02] Methuselah was a living testimony that
[5:04] judgment was coming on the Earth
[5:11] 300 years and beget sons and daughters
[5:14] so he lived 300 a day for uh every uh
[5:19] 365 years
[5:21] let's see
[5:23] let's see what notes I have from you
[5:25] know and it was the seventh from Adam
[5:27] and seven is if if you look at the
[5:29] numbers that uh how brother Brandon
[5:31] presented numbers
[5:32] there's different quotes that present
[5:34] like the number seven in different ways
[5:36] he said the number seven is perfection
[5:38] completion
[5:40] rest worship and the number six
[5:43] represents man
[5:44] and kind of think of as man's separation
[5:47] from God but number seven returns a man
[5:51] to God so that he can participate in
[5:53] true worship true rest with God
[5:56] six of Separation as man trying to do
[5:59] something for himself the seven is
[6:01] returning to God for the seventh from
[6:03] Adam
[6:05] achieved rest with God in profession a
[6:08] perfect walk a communion with God
[6:11] that he had reached a moral Fitness
[6:15] because in first John 1 through 1 6 it
[6:17] says if we say that we have fellowship
[6:20] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[6:22] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[6:24] light as he is in the light we have
[6:26] Fellowship one with another in the blood
[6:28] of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us
[6:29] from all sin
[6:31] if we say that we have no same way to
[6:33] see for ourselves right the truth is not
[6:35] in US
[6:37] and you know a lot of times especially
[6:40] new Believers think that uh you got to
[6:42] get everything at once but anyway with
[6:45] God for 300 years he didn't get
[6:47] everything it was it was slow and steady
[6:49] wins the race
[6:51] he uh he persevered after 300 years he
[6:55] still was walking with God
[6:58] and Hebrews 11 5 it says that he Enoch
[7:02] please God by faith in it was translated
[7:04] that he should not receive death and was
[7:05] not found because God had translated him
[7:07] for before he had this his Trent before
[7:10] his translation he had this testimony
[7:12] that he pleased God and how do we please
[7:14] God the only way you can please God Is
[7:16] by faith
[7:17] so without faith it is impossible to
[7:19] please him for he that cometh to God
[7:21] must believe that he is and that he is a
[7:24] rewarder and that diligently seek him
[7:27] Ena was a witness for God
[7:30] because in Jude 114 that says in enig
[7:33] also the seventh from Adam prophesied of
[7:36] these saying behold the Lord cometh with
[7:38] ten thousands of his Saints to execute
[7:41] judgment upon all
[7:42] and to convince all that are ungodly
[7:44] among them of all the road LEDs which
[7:46] they have ungodly committed and of all
[7:49] their hard speeches which ungodly
[7:50] Sinners have spoken against him
[7:56] so edict was an example of the faithful
[7:59] believer the Rapture Saints and a
[8:01] witness
[8:01] to Adam's genealogy of what could have
[8:04] been
[8:09] what brother Branham wrote about did you
[8:11] say or said about it in the Easter seal
[8:13] 1965 and when it come time
[8:20] and he walked to a poem he quickened him
[8:23] he took his mortal body up in a ratchet
[8:25] I'm gonna talk about what the latter is
[8:27] in a second
[8:29] in 1965 it is the rising of the Sun in
[8:32] it with that perfect testimony that
[8:34] everything that God told me to do I did
[8:37] it
[8:38] everything that I've seen he said for me
[8:40] do I've done it
[8:43] and he becomes such as dynamics of
[8:46] mechanics until when the quickening
[8:48] power struck him the mechanics
[8:51] it just lifted him right up he walked on
[8:53] out of the earth into heaven
[8:55] if any kind of Revelation from God not
[8:58] only of what was going to happen to the
[8:59] world that the flood was going to come
[9:00] but he also had a revelation of how to
[9:02] get out of here and so he put a monument
[9:04] in Egypt but for how to escape that
[9:08] modern that money must survive the flood
[9:10] in fact if you look at pictures you can
[9:11] still see the water line of where the
[9:15] flood receiving on the pyramid
[9:18] so Enix pyramid was a timepiece all
[9:21] right I brought around talked about how
[9:23] that we're at the king's chamber
[9:25] it's a model of how to take a body
[9:27] change a model of a stitch you're a
[9:28] perfect man because it's got seven steps
[9:30] inside of it when you get into the
[9:32] king's Spirit the king's chamber
[9:35] it's the dimensions are exactly the same
[9:37] size as the holy of holies in that
[9:39] little call from that nobody knows what
[9:40] it's for because they didn't find a body
[9:42] in it they thought it was a burial
[9:44] chamber the the Coffer is the exact same
[9:47] size as if if you were to take the Ark
[9:50] of the Covenant and drop it in it would
[9:52] hold the Ark of the Covenant perfectly
[10:03] so
[10:05] yeah all down through Genesis chapter
[10:07] five
[10:08] as we're reading these names it says
[10:10] that Annie died and he died and he died
[10:13] and he died right
[10:16] because Adam
[10:17] sold us into them and Adam all died
[10:21] and you know death is a simple thing of
[10:24] Christianity
[10:25] I had him sold us into death and we had
[10:28] to have someone come back a perfect
[10:30] sacrifice come to redeem us from death
[10:32] into life
[10:33] but then after he died we also have to
[10:36] die Jesus said I'm crucified with Christ
[10:38] and yet I leave that's a great mystery
[10:40] he said I died daily
[10:43] and it to typify our death we're a bird
[10:47] in baptism and to and then to show that
[10:50] we are we die to the things of this
[10:53] world through our own flesh the old our
[10:55] old husband is crucified
[10:57] it's killed and so that we can be
[11:00] married in Christ
[11:02] death is a central part
[11:10] so
[11:11] we need to get back to what uh Matthew
[11:15] and Luke testify of
[11:17] which is a coming Redeemer
[11:22] and uh to get back
[11:26] God had to bridge provide a bridge
[11:29] between Heaven and Earth
[11:31] now brother random talked about how all
[11:33] down through history he tried to find
[11:34] somebody to Anchor this ladder from the
[11:37] Throne of God in heaven
[11:39] so that we could get back right he tried
[11:42] to Anchor me
[11:44] to Adam
[11:46] he tried to Anchor it to Jacob the old
[11:48] shyster tried to he kept trying to find
[11:51] somebody to Anchored to but nobody was
[11:53] perfect because Adam has told us all in
[11:55] the city the only one that he could find
[11:58] anchor to was the son of man amen so
[12:02] let's turn to Genesis 28.
[12:06] thank you
[12:08] y'all forgive me my horses a little bit
[12:25] uh we're gonna start at verse 11. let me
[12:28] let me set up a story
[12:29] so Jacob the little shockster has done
[12:33] everything he could to get the
[12:34] birthright because it was so important
[12:36] to him he would borrow still live
[12:39] whatever it took to get that Birthright
[12:41] right in in the last chapter
[12:44] Esau was ready to kill him so his mama
[12:47] says you need you need to get out of
[12:49] here and at the top of chapter 28 I said
[12:52] Isaac called him and said listen don't
[12:54] take one of the dollars of payment uh
[12:56] arise good put that around for the house
[12:58] of Beth will that mother's father
[13:00] and so Jacob runs runs away and he's
[13:03] afraid that he's the guy at the end of
[13:05] the Esau and Jacob in verse 11. he
[13:08] lighted up on a certain place
[13:10] and Terry there all night because the
[13:12] sun will set and he took of the soul to
[13:15] that place
[13:16] and put them for his pillow
[13:18] this place was called Luz which means
[13:21] separation he was separated from
[13:23] everything he knew of separated from the
[13:25] things of the world
[13:26] and God brother random said when he put
[13:30] his head down on this Stone
[13:32] God put him into a coma that's what Burt
[13:35] random said and gave him a vision
[13:37] yeah
[13:38] when you know this the whole thing of
[13:40] death God really can't do nothing until
[13:43] you're all totally out of the way and
[13:45] death and Jacob had his head laid down
[13:48] in the dust of the Earth on this rock
[13:51] you know this rock the the Jews say that
[13:54] this same rock is the foundation stone
[13:56] of the temple it's the what the holy of
[13:59] holies was built on and if you go to
[14:01] Jerusalem now they've got the uh in the
[14:04] mosque of Omar they call it the pierced
[14:06] Stone because it has a hole in it that
[14:08] goes down into The Well of Souls
[14:10] appears just like The Rock The Rock of
[14:13] our Salvation was pierced
[14:16] and verse 12 and he dreamed and behold a
[14:19] ladder set up on the earth and the top
[14:22] of it reached to heaven and behold the
[14:24] angels of God ascending and descending
[14:26] on it
[14:27] and behold
[14:30] the Lord stood above me and said I am
[14:33] the Lord God of Abraham my father and
[14:35] the god of Isaac we're on thou lies to
[14:38] thee will I give it until I see you and
[14:42] our seed shall be as a dust of the earth
[14:44] and now I'm shall spread abroad to the
[14:46] West
[14:47] into the East and to the north and to
[14:49] the South and in thee and in thy seed
[14:51] shall all the families of the Earth
[14:53] be blessed right not just the families
[14:57] of Israel but all the families of the
[15:00] Earth right call them Jesus
[15:02] anybody can be saved
[15:05] believe
[15:06] and behold I am with thee and we'll keep
[15:09] thee in all places without ghosts and
[15:11] will bring thee again into this land for
[15:13] I will not leave thee until I have done
[15:15] that which I've spoken to the uh
[15:18] and Jacob awaked out of his sleep
[15:21] and he says surely the Lord is in this
[15:23] place and I knew it not and he was
[15:25] afraid and said how Dreadful is this
[15:27] place this is none other but the house
[15:30] of God and this is the Gate of Heaven
[15:33] and Jacob rose up early in the morning
[15:35] and took the stone that he had put for
[15:36] his pillows and set it up for a pillar
[15:39] and pour the oil up on the top of it
[15:43] and he called the name of that place
[15:46] Bethel but the name of that city was
[15:48] called love
[15:53] means the house of God right
[15:56] and Jacob battle The Vow saying if God
[15:59] will be with me and will keep me in this
[16:01] way that I go and will give me bread to
[16:03] eat and Raymond to put all so that I
[16:05] come again to my father's house in peace
[16:08] then shall the Lord be my God that's how
[16:10] a lot of us are we'll make a condition
[16:12] after God's already told us all of our
[16:14] his promises we'll say well if God will
[16:17] do this for me then I'll serve him and
[16:21] this Stone which I've set for a pillar
[16:23] shall be John's house that of all that
[16:25] thou shalt give me I will surely give
[16:27] the tenth unto thee
[16:30] so we can see in this story how God
[16:33] selects those who have nothing and gives
[16:35] them everything Jacob I'd run away from
[16:37] everything he know he knew it was
[16:40] completely separated
[16:42] but though he was completely alone and
[16:44] friendless as far as the world is
[16:46] concerned God showed him a vision that
[16:49] his interests were visiting all of
[16:52] Heaven the Angels ascending and
[16:54] descending to bring a message to make
[16:56] God's word manifest to manifest his
[16:59] attributes and his people
[17:06] brother Randall said in the
[17:07] infallibility of God spoken word in 1956
[17:11] he lives that anchoring place where
[17:13] Jacobs what a promise he would be he was
[17:17] God's Eternal promise seed he was that
[17:19] sure stone that perfect Foundation that
[17:21] God's truth would anchor in and all
[17:23] devils in hell and everything else could
[17:25] never move it God had anchored it
[17:27] forever he'll see the angels of God and
[17:30] these ascending and descending upon the
[17:32] son of man
[17:33] the unity of one God and the one Church
[17:36] in 1958 and did you ever think of the
[17:39] Tower of Babylon and compare it with
[17:41] Jacob's Ladder how that they were trying
[17:42] to build a stair strips around the title
[17:44] that are reaching them into heaven only
[17:46] trying to pervert Jacob's Ladder which
[17:48] reached from the Heavens to the Earth
[17:50] and Angels descending and ascending
[17:53] perverting it
[17:55] foreign
[17:57] the faith of Abraham he said you was
[18:00] baptized by the grace of God and this
[18:02] great big arcade that's got every
[18:04] Redemptive blessing in it Everything
[18:06] Jesus died for is right here in the body
[18:09] of Christ healing salvation joy and
[18:12] peace all these things belongs to you
[18:14] it's yours
[18:16] the availability of God spoken a word in
[18:19] 1956 he said but God made the Covenant
[18:22] unconditionally and he hooked it into
[18:23] Christ Jesus
[18:25] there is Anchor there's no slipping and
[18:27] sliding there's no way of getting away
[18:29] what is it it's hooked by God above and
[18:32] by the Son of God beneath and what is it
[18:35] it's a pathway it's a traveler's way
[18:37] from Earth to glory and you can't fail
[18:39] look there's great companies of angels
[18:41] up and down here ascending and
[18:43] descending picking up the weary and the
[18:45] sick
[18:46] healing their bodies that show invasions
[18:48] and mighty signs and wonders can't fail
[18:51] it can't slip it can't slide you're safe
[18:53] God said so that sells it forever it's
[18:56] hooked around the heart of God of Heaven
[18:59] looked around the Son of God down here
[19:01] and we're brought into it through the
[19:04] Son of God we Ascend to him
[19:06] then what you scared about I promise
[19:09] between God and Christ and we're in
[19:12] between them with angels He said he will
[19:15] give his angels charge I believe and the
[19:17] angels of God are encamped about those
[19:19] who fear Him and all up and down when
[19:22] we're making this Foundation climbing
[19:24] each day higher and higher each day
[19:26] brings me to one around higher higher
[19:28] move up up anything happens if I fall
[19:31] along the road or something happens to
[19:33] me there's a great host of Angels
[19:36] standing there to pick me up
[19:38] come on we're marching on up towards
[19:40] Zion on up to that beautiful city above
[19:45] now
[19:46] what a lot of people tie up Jacobs
[19:49] Jacob's Ladder with because you can see
[19:52] how he's he's anchored into Christ at
[19:54] the bottom in the Throne of God at the
[19:56] top and we're in the middle climbing up
[19:58] and he said I had a lot of other folks
[20:01] that I forgot to print out but he said
[20:03] we're you get up to sanctification you
[20:05] can look it back and see where you came
[20:06] from get up to the baptism of the Holy
[20:08] Ghost you look back to where you came
[20:09] from to see how far you've gotten and if
[20:12] you need any promise of God you just
[20:13] keep climbing up that ladder until you
[20:15] grab an old to it from the throne and
[20:18] because we're making our way up to Glory
[20:23] so the Jacob's Ladder is God's God's
[20:27] attribute his genes May being made
[20:29] manifest in US
[20:33] in the end of let's turn to John one
[20:53] let's start at verse 43.
[21:00] the day falling Jesus would go forth in
[21:03] the Galilee
[21:05] and find a Phillip and sayeth unto him
[21:08] follow me
[21:09] now Philip was the best Syed of the city
[21:11] of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth
[21:14] Nathaniel and sayeth unto him we have
[21:16] found him of whom Moses in the law and
[21:18] the prophets did right Joseph of
[21:21] Nazareth the son of Joseph
[21:24] Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and
[21:27] Nathaniel said unto him
[21:29] they found the one that the ladder could
[21:32] be anchored to and Nathaniel said unto
[21:34] them can there any good thing come out
[21:36] of matter
[21:37] Philip said unto him come and see Jesus
[21:40] saw the Nathaniel coming to him and
[21:42] saith of him behold an Israelite indeed
[21:44] and whom is no God there's no bitterness
[21:46] at all in it
[21:48] Nathaniel saith unto him once you know
[21:50] it's thou me
[21:52] Jesus answered and said unto him before
[21:54] that Philip called thee when thou was
[21:56] under the Fig Tree I saw the Nathaniel
[21:59] answer that saith unto him grab all Thou
[22:01] Art the Son of God now or the kingdom of
[22:03] evil
[22:04] Jesus answered and said to him but
[22:06] because I said unto thee I saw the end
[22:07] of the Fig Tree believe us now shall see
[22:10] greater things than these
[22:12] and he saith unto him verily verily I
[22:15] say unto you Hereafter ye shall see
[22:17] Heaven open and the angels are ascending
[22:20] and descending upon the son of man
[22:22] now what happened next he said you just
[22:25] paid you you think you've seen something
[22:27] now you're about to see the the
[22:28] manifestation of all the promises of God
[22:31] the attributes of God revealed in me
[22:34] right
[22:35] that's what the son of man is the god
[22:37] revealing himself in man
[22:40] the next thing in chapter two just to
[22:43] sum it up they were looking for uh they
[22:45] ran out of wine
[22:47] and they were looking for they uh they
[22:50] needed
[22:51] some wine for the wedding
[22:53] so Jesus Took water that didn't have any
[22:56] alcohol in it any power in it and he
[22:58] turned it into something the type of the
[23:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost That Could
[23:02] reveal a type of when God's attributes
[23:05] were being familiar with us
[23:08] so that's what this ladder is God
[23:11] revealing that he is a Healer that he is
[23:14] a savior he's a provider and if we make
[23:17] our way up all of these attributes are
[23:19] revealed through us
[23:21] and now
[23:22] even the the secular World tied to
[23:25] Jacob's Ladder with genetics there's a
[23:28] book I found on Amazon called um Jacob's
[23:30] Ladder the human genome the history of
[23:33] the human genome and it's a scientific
[23:35] but it doesn't have anything to do with
[23:37] religion or anything but they're they
[23:39] they know that it has something to do
[23:40] with genes and uh I've heard that a lot
[23:45] of people say well it's uh the Jacob's
[23:47] Ladder is human genetics because I got a
[23:50] picture of what human DNA looks like
[23:52] this is
[23:54] it looks like a ladder yep
[23:58] now if you take human DNA
[24:03] and and try to hook that ladder onto a
[24:06] human you can't hook it on the app you
[24:08] can't hook it onto Jacob you can only
[24:10] hook it on to God right
[24:13] and when God uh
[24:16] if you're if the ladder is hooked onto
[24:18] him and you're on the climbing up the
[24:21] ladder then his attributes can be made
[24:23] manifest in you let's put a book see
[24:25] what brother Reynolds said about genius
[24:27] this uh I've only got five more minutes
[24:29] preach it brother if you got 20 minutes
[24:34] I forgot it was in the class with you
[24:38] uh 1963
[24:40] it's not managed fast you got tan man
[24:44] all right well I got permission man you
[24:45] got 10 minutes uh this is kind of a long
[24:48] story My Brother Brian was telling the
[24:50] story of a father and mother who wanted
[24:52] to know what was wrong with their boy
[24:55] and uh the 19 1963 of paradox now this
[25:00] is going to take a few minutes to read
[25:01] so your own bear with him for instance a
[25:04] few days ago I was called in on or on a
[25:07] little something going on there was a
[25:09] fine young man very fine boy he was
[25:11] going with a little girl very fine
[25:12] little girl out of a fine family
[25:15] and this boy all of a sudden came up
[25:17] with some kind of an idea and he just
[25:19] walked away
[25:20] he did something wrong to the little
[25:22] girl and what's his promised her to do a
[25:24] certain thing and didn't do it and
[25:27] instead of coming to the girl and
[25:28] apologizing like a gentleman should do
[25:30] he it just wasn't in him to do it
[25:33] and the father and mother called me to
[25:34] the scene and said we will desire to
[25:36] know what is wrong with our boy now it's
[25:39] not easy to do sometimes but you must be
[25:41] truthful and honest
[25:43] therefore the boy was a Christian as far
[25:45] as a Believer he had repented and had
[25:47] been baptized and had his position among
[25:50] the Believers but yet had not received
[25:52] the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter
[25:55] how much he thought he had
[25:57] you thinking you haven't had me is two
[26:00] different things you might be able to
[26:02] try to see you having you might be able
[26:04] to show some evidence of some emotion
[26:06] but unless your life is vindicating what
[26:08] you're professing to have you still
[26:10] haven't got it no matter how many
[26:12] emotions how much you jump run
[26:14] Sensations speaking in tongues or
[26:16] shouting or whatever you make might lay
[26:18] it upon which is all right
[26:20] I believe in all that too but unless
[26:22] your life cooks with your testimony then
[26:25] you haven't got it because the fruit of
[26:27] the spirit vindicates what you are just
[26:30] like the fruit of any tree tells what it
[26:32] is Jesus said by their fruit you shall
[26:35] know that
[26:36] now this young Fella's parents his
[26:39] mother is German no reflection on the
[26:40] German but there is a strain in that
[26:42] family and that is they'll just see it
[26:44] and you can talk to them and they'll
[26:46] just stare you right in the face
[26:48] this girl's sister the mother of this
[26:49] boy her sister I've come down the street
[26:51] many morning and this young lady be
[26:52] sitting out in the yard and I'd say good
[26:54] morning to you she'd just look at me and
[26:56] I'd stop and I'd say sure fine morning
[26:59] she would just stay and look right into
[27:00] an intelligent woman and I'd say come up
[27:02] to see us sometime
[27:04] she just stand and look what her
[27:06] brothers are that way father and mothers
[27:07] that way now the father of the boy is
[27:09] strictly an Irishman Moody and high
[27:11] tempered High Strung that's his whole
[27:13] family like that except one another out
[27:15] of the family converted now in this that
[27:18] boy this father and mother both are
[27:20] Christians fiddle of the Holy Ghost
[27:23] and they have brought this young man up
[27:24] in the way of the Lord and now the young
[27:26] man is about 17 or 18 years old
[27:28] something along their very fine kid and
[27:31] he's been a real model boy at home nice
[27:33] kid and he's got a brother that's just
[27:36] vice versa but the girls the mother's
[27:38] family lives close to a fine church but
[27:40] do you think they'd ever come over there
[27:42] and know and they know it's right but
[27:44] it's just not in them to ask forgiveness
[27:46] or ask pardon me they just won't do it
[27:48] it's just not in them now here's it pay
[27:51] attention now the genes and the father
[27:54] and the mother of this boy no matter how
[27:56] much they are converted still remain the
[27:57] flesh that's been integrated after this
[27:59] boy we're not saved by our genes that's
[28:02] right you can't hook that ladder on any
[28:03] one of us right you got to hook it on to
[28:05] the perfect sacrifice therefore the boy
[28:08] has got a complex in him just like from
[28:10] his mother's family and they are not
[28:12] forgiving they will not apologize and
[28:13] that's where that boy stands
[28:15] now I said to the father no matter how
[28:18] much you've raised him up I said now
[28:20] look at you out of here all your family
[28:21] out of all them drunks and fighting and
[28:24] shooting and cutting and so forth now
[28:26] look at your family to the mother there
[28:28] are a bunch of people just sit there and
[28:29] won't speak very independent and so
[28:31] forth irreverent to religion but I said
[28:34] it's not you you're the only one of all
[28:37] your sisters and brothers and you are
[28:39] sweet kind and forgiving what does that
[28:41] in your tree part of that family tree
[28:44] yet you have received the Holy Ghost
[28:46] that's the thing that made you tender
[28:48] and sweet it's not your people anymore
[28:51] it's not your jeans anymore it's his
[28:53] jeans it's your Christ that lives in you
[28:56] I added that I wasn't reading that I
[28:59] said to them that's okay I said and how
[29:01] moody and high temperature and how
[29:02] strong but you're not you're kind
[29:04] forgiving what is it the Holy Spirit you
[29:07] know more what you are it's Christ in
[29:09] you I said now that same thing has to
[29:11] happen to your son
[29:13] now if you want to look at how genes are
[29:16] your your DNA that ladder is made up of
[29:19] four different uh
[29:21] chemicals or whatever you want to call
[29:23] ATC and G and that controls how you're
[29:26] manifested
[29:28] the different combinations and uh there
[29:31] comes a point in the in the human
[29:34] reproductive system when uh
[29:37] after the the uh egg is is germinated
[29:41] that's sealed off just like when you're
[29:44] baptized with the Holy Ghost it forms a
[29:46] seal around it nothing else can get in
[29:48] to impregnate it with anything else it's
[29:50] sealed off and then a few weeks later
[29:52] something starts happening that
[29:54] scientists can't even figure out
[29:56] those dings there might be a little cell
[29:59] after it started to buy there might be a
[30:00] cell on the outside
[30:02] that all of a sudden the genes flip and
[30:04] it turns into a part of the spinal
[30:07] column
[30:08] those cells are being placed it's like
[30:10] replaced under the body of Christ
[30:11] there's some that are are pastors
[30:15] prophets and teachers there's some that
[30:17] are are deacons and there's some that
[30:20] are just Homemakers and prayer warriors
[30:22] but those genes are flipped on to make
[30:25] us what God wants us to be and to reveal
[30:27] himself enough
[30:28] that's what I believe amen
[30:31] and God has only provided place of
[30:34] worship 1965 and in there
[30:37] he said I chose to put my name at the
[30:40] door of the House of My Worship for my
[30:42] family will be gathered in there under
[30:44] the blood like it was in Egypt anything
[30:46] outside died
[30:48] and in there there's another bread
[30:50] there's no denominational mixture
[30:52] anywhere in my house my children born of
[30:56] my genes
[30:57] amen Lord God my genes are in them I put
[31:01] my word in them at the Rapture in 1965
[31:04] he said
[31:06] the bride rather is the one that's going
[31:08] to be in the Rapture that alone nothing
[31:10] but the bride the elected ones four
[31:13] known by God from the beginning the
[31:16] father's spiritual genes
[31:19] in 1965 things that are to be he said
[31:23] when the word of God
[31:25] lit our souls and we become Sons and
[31:28] Daughters of God we're the attributes
[31:30] the gene of God in us to be Sons and
[31:33] Daughters of the father God in heaven
[31:35] crying Abba Father my God my God In My
[31:39] Father's House
[31:41] and then we'll uh this is kind of
[31:44] drawing to a close and now we've got to
[31:45] the point where we can see Christ as the
[31:48] anchoring point and if we're in him he
[31:51] manifests himself through us and that's
[31:53] what uh I was getting that last time
[31:55] looking at Matthew Mark Luke and John
[31:57] why is there not a genealogy anymore
[31:59] because a servant doesn't have a
[32:01] genealogy a lot of John doesn't have
[32:04] does it have why John doesn't have a
[32:06] genealogy because God how can you put a
[32:09] genealogy to God
[32:12] Jesus was talking to I think it was
[32:14] Nicodemus he said no man knows where uh
[32:17] if you're born in the spirit where does
[32:18] it come from where is it going right you
[32:20] can't you can't put it on paper
[32:23] but Matthew my King has to have a
[32:25] genealog right Luke son of man has a
[32:28] genealogy and they go in different
[32:30] directions Matthew comes down from Adam
[32:33] because God's coming down to get us and
[32:36] Luke goes back up front two at him I'm
[32:40] sorry I say Matthew comes down from
[32:42] Abraham so he's a promise seed and Luke
[32:44] goes up to Adam the Son of God saying
[32:47] he's taking us back right to where he
[32:49] came from and uh we'll look at that a
[32:51] little bit closer next time
[32:54] oh yeah that's good
