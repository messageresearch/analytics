[0:00] but his own received him not but as many
[0:02] as received him because he power to
[0:04] become the sons of God I'm quoting
[0:06] scripture you realized then that when
[0:09] the Lord Jesus started out there doing
[0:12] don't you think of what a wonderful day
[0:14] he was having when he seen his people
[0:18] turning him down
[0:19] rejecting him on every hand and yet he
[0:22] turns around and there's a little
[0:23] Gentile woman he said Lord this is just
[0:29] crumbs his crumbs off the table you know
[0:34] he said that's not right for me to give
[0:37] it to you he called her a dog did you
[0:40] have no right for none of these time she
[0:43] said yes Lord I said the dogs eat the
[0:46] crumbs from the master's table the Bible
[0:50] said he said I have not seen so great a
[0:53] faith in Israel she was a Gentile don't
[1:00] you think with his heart he would
[1:01] Almighty God don't you think with in his
[1:04] heart he already knew the story he knew
[1:08] that they'd reject him as Messiah but he
[1:11] knew the Gentiles would receive him so
[1:17] did he come to the Jews yeah he had to
[1:21] do that like the Apostle Paul had to be
[1:24] to the Jews right okay
[1:26] but then when it finished up he said
[1:28] I'll leave you I'm going to the Gentiles
[1:31] see the Lord Jesus look at all of that
[1:34] when that man come up and said to him
[1:36] don't come over here said just speak the
[1:39] word and said my server to be healed
[1:42] that was Gentiles and he said Oh Lord
[1:46] look at that he could see what he was
[1:49] a-doing building up and so what's watch
[1:51] 1 conv o Israel has always been chosen
[1:55] people right then you tell me why he
[1:59] walked down through there and didn't
[2:00] choose a big group he had toyo when he
[2:04] got through and one of them was the
[2:06] devil he hand
[2:10] hit'em Gentile dispensation coming into
[2:15] view speaking of it
[2:18] he said come on Peter come on guy come
[2:20] on you don't think like that that
[2:24] thrills my heart I realized he knew that
[2:27] there was the Gentiles that was going to
[2:30] accept him for what he was just saying
[2:36] and they did accept him but look Church
[2:40] what was eaten away back there in that
[2:43] time it was not the new birth it was
[2:47] eaten away it wasn't that it was the
[2:53] point of the statue of a perfect man the
[2:56] things Peter and Paul talked that was
[2:59] what was rejected that was what was
[3:01] eaten away in the Dark Ages and there
[3:09] was that couldn't be nothing else coming
[3:11] forth and he'd start with ruler to
[3:14] Luther with the just shall live by faith
[3:21] that wasn't restoration brother Brennan
[3:25] said it wasn't and you listened to him
[3:27] that's what I say
[3:28] you listen to him and you'll get
[3:30] massively confused or even you get
[3:32] straightened out if you let the Holy
[3:33] Spirit take care of it but everyone said
[3:36] Luther was Reformation he said Wesley
[3:42] was Reformation Reformation is carnal
[3:45] reform something you think you have
[3:49] something to do with so look at Luther
[3:51] he thought he had something to do with
[3:53] that justification he did he accepted it
[3:56] but by accepting it he didn't get the
[4:01] full understanding of it he got what he
[4:06] had and what was needed for the time
[4:08] that put him into the body
[4:10] listen see then
[4:15] what did it turn out to be how did it
[4:18] turn out to come forth they come forth
[4:23] in an understanding that you and I
[4:29] didn't know what in the world we were
[4:30] talking about when we heard the profit
[4:36] season I say that piece oh yeah I had a
[4:38] great understand yeah nice told you you
[4:43] want to take your understanding we'll
[4:45] talk about it not being sarcastic and
[4:48] they're hateful but I had a good
[4:50] understanding of the Bible remember
[4:54] where my story comes from did I read
[4:58] Malachi 4 and said according to the
[5:00] Bible there's gonna be two prophets
[5:02] coming was any of you looking for two
[5:07] prophets to come no that's what I'm
[5:14] saying see then I say things like that
[5:15] and you think I'm sarcastic and hateful
[5:17] and Argus is any problem with telling
[5:20] the truth see I didn't have any trouble
[5:26] when brother mo said brother around him
[5:27] was a prophet you remember the story
[5:29] when I told him I said listen you saw
[5:32] the dead raised you saw this that healed
[5:34] you saw the Word of God being spoken I
[5:36] said I didn't see it so I can't do it
[5:38] but I said you tell me what he taught in
[5:40] the Bible you tell me what he told in
[5:46] the Word of God and I'll know whether he
[5:48] was a prophet or not I still stand with
[5:54] that today
[5:55] can you put everything you've got only
[5:57] he was a prophet when something comes up
[6:00] there's like I said when a statement
[6:02] comes up that you're born again and then
[6:04] baptized into the body do you still
[6:06] believe the Prophet was right even
[6:12] though you'd admit maybe you don't
[6:13] understand what he's talking about
[6:21] we can get down on the hard things okay
[6:25] see do we really believe brother branham
[6:27] was a prophet when he preached there was
[6:33] one week left after the rapture and we
[6:36] argue with him that it only thrilling a
[6:37] half years left after the rapture do we
[6:42] believe Ryland was a prophet the best
[6:47] way to say it is I don't understand okay
[6:51] that's the best way to say something
[6:53] when something comes up the best thing
[6:55] to say is I don't understand because at
[6:59] least you've got it on its heart out of
[7:00] it and God can help you I can prove that
[7:05] right here but bring it on you see I'm
[7:12] not arguing with nobody about the word
[7:13] it takes one thing about it there's
[7:17] things in this prophets message that
[7:19] your human mind is never going to
[7:21] comprehend it can't comprehend what a
[7:27] prophetic prophet was bringing we've
[7:30] tried to figure it out we've tried to do
[7:32] everything and we wound up just getting
[7:35] further awake cause we're not as was not
[7:38] he saying that in those seventh seal
[7:41] when he says go on as you are in trouble
[7:44] don't try to figure all this thing out
[7:45] especially with this seal coming up
[7:47] tonight he said go on and he said this
[7:49] stay with the same simple message said
[7:51] it'll be made known he remember that
[7:52] quote would have we done that or we
[7:56] tried to figure it all out what you see
[8:03] Joel said I will restore now giving us a
[8:07] minute then we'll quit
[8:09] Joel said I will restore what is to be
[8:12] restored not a new birth
[8:20] it was never taken away I don't care
[8:26] what age you want to call it or whatever
[8:27] do you want to do with it brother Brad
[8:29] said every age I'm quoting him every age
[8:31] had the baptism with the Holy Ghost then
[8:33] you burn the art that's number one drive
[8:40] that stake down they say that's it
[8:41] that's all settled but do we believe
[8:49] that what he brought to us was the truth
[8:55] then we I mean in your own mind ain't
[8:58] asked me to raise hands I don't do it
[8:59] cuz see that just gets embarrassing I
[9:01] thought it's bad to raise your hand
[9:03] today and then go fluid tomorrow okay
[9:07] then go down because you don't
[9:09] understand but listen Church it was not
[9:14] the new birth that was eaten down all
[9:19] right
[9:19] it was not the headstone that was eaten
[9:24] down go to that and come yet I've got
[9:26] the quotes laying right here in front of
[9:28] it hadn't come yet it's not the love or
[9:34] a capstone of the statue of a perfect
[9:37] man it was not eating away all right
[9:43] so what was eating away what is between
[9:47] here and there and see we say eating the
[9:52] way you look at it like taking the Bible
[9:55] to turn out them pages not any what I'm
[9:58] talking about I'm talking about this
[10:03] Bible needs to be revealed to you and me
[10:07] if it's revealed then we have what is
[10:11] saying if it's letters on a page we have
[10:14] letters on a page me the disciples had
[10:20] the revelation of Jesus Christ right now
[10:25] listen to me for a second
[10:27] did it aside both how the revelation of
[10:29] Jesus cry I can ask you shake your head
[10:31] because there's Michael boom
[10:33] you know I'm asking to be sensible in
[10:36] your own head
[10:38] the disciples never taught a Trinity
[10:43] there was no such thing taught in the
[10:46] original disciples even though this guy
[10:50] what was his name
[10:51] sir it says come along at the same time
[10:53] right after Paul writing that period
[10:55] closer and he was already teaching Sean
[11:00] it was trying to in wrote he was already
[11:02] teaching that Jesus was just a demon God
[11:06] which was another God you know flesh
[11:10] man's or something that wouldn't ride
[11:12] all right he was trying to do those
[11:14] things but the one God held true to the
[11:17] fourth church age I'm quoting brother
[11:20] Branham so if you want them I'll give
[11:22] them to you the one God true stayed to
[11:25] the fourth church age and they's even
[11:29] things Church D you don't listen and
[11:31] don't pay attention to that's why people
[11:33] think were the most illiterate people
[11:35] that you can say and truly a lot of
[11:38] people are you know there's people in
[11:41] the days of Martin Luther that taught
[11:43] the Godhead truth right because there's
[11:52] a little line that all the ways that
[11:54] come through that's why when you're
[11:58] Baptist comes up and you say what do you
[12:01] believe they'll say we believe in one
[12:03] true and living God they still teach one
[12:07] God ask them they'll different Trinity
[12:14] they'll get onto your body Trinity they
[12:16] don't believe in a Trinity if they're
[12:18] real good badness to the church what
[12:27] happened down through the ages the
[12:30] revealed word is what was either way the
[12:35] real truth the revealed word began to be
[12:39] eat away cankerworm palm worm locust
[12:42] caterpillar they begin to eat it down
[12:46] they didn't do away with the words in
[12:48] this Bible now I'm trying to illustrate
[12:51] it so if you listen I'm not stolen no
[12:54] stones or asking you I'm just saying to
[12:56] place it and ask you for a raise of
[12:59] hands but how many of you believed in
[13:00] the Trinity before you heard of this
[13:02] message in one way or the other
[13:06] no God see mine was garden three persons
[13:10] cuz brother Mon asked me what I believe
[13:12] I said one true and living God
[13:14] he said explain that I said okay Father
[13:17] Son and Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ
[13:19] God in three persons Blessed Trinity he
[13:25] stopped he said you just as Trinitarian
[13:28] interesting I said would you explain
[13:30] yourself sir he said a father is a
[13:34] father and the son is the son and a Holy
[13:37] Ghost of the three and you're a human
[13:39] and you're this and you're that he went
[13:41] through a simple little illustration and
[13:42] he said there's one true God what do you
[13:46] believe I said don't believe what he
[13:47] used to that's no problem to me I saw it
[13:51] in one illustration and that ended it I
[13:54] didn't mean I understood the Godhead no
[13:56] way I'm still amazed at it I still ain't
[14:01] never preached all I can see about the
[14:03] Godhead we get any eternity I'll take
[14:05] care huh we can talk about it down
[14:08] through the eternity and say you mean
[14:10] you understood that you don't understood
[14:12] the death but listen if you'll admit to
[14:20] one thing we'll move on if you'll admit
[14:23] humanly speaking in your mind that at
[14:26] one time you was a Trinitarian you
[14:30] believed in three guards or you believed
[14:32] in some way different from brother
[14:35] branham's explanation well we put it
[14:37] that way you believed in to some way
[14:39] different from the explanation of
[14:41] brother Branham all right now if you do
[14:44] that now you won't internet you
[14:45] listening that that's all I'm asking you
[14:47] do I'm asking you just be sensible what
[14:53] was wrong with what we were doing when
[14:56] we were teaching the Trinity
[15:01] well I mean I believed in Jesus I
[15:04] believe in jibt I could prove to you I
[15:06] could go through it I was in the Baptist
[15:08] Church we we've valued reading and
[15:10] studying I could go through the Yahweh's
[15:13] I could go through the im's I could tell
[15:16] you Jehovah and what it meant and how
[15:19] that Jehovah goes back to the word
[15:21] Jehovah C which goes back to
[15:24] self-existing the Bible tells you that I
[15:34] could read in the madness and take you
[15:37] back to all the way up till it would put
[15:40] Jesus standing back there yet I know
[15:47] where I was wrong because you see he
[15:51] wasn't standing back there
[15:52] I love it when the Prophet said it
[15:56] they just thrilled my soul when he made
[15:58] their statement he said when my hand
[16:01] said in the garden he said God never
[16:05] left him he said he didn't go away and
[16:09] leave him that he said he'd come right
[16:12] down to live with mankind the thrills my
[16:18] heart to realize they don't matter how
[16:21] sinful we are he's still an advocate if
[16:28] we just realize he's still on our side
[16:30] we gotta worry about no problem okay but
[16:34] listen
[16:34] now when that new little streisand can
[16:37] you understand what was eating away the
[16:39] revelation of one God the revelation
[16:43] that he was one true and living God you
[16:46] know that most people call us oneness
[16:49] you know they call us one that's what
[16:51] caught of our believing and you know to
[16:53] most people and I can sit down and talk
[16:54] with you a little bit about it on that
[16:56] line
[16:56] most people are oneness because it's one
[17:01] like your finger to most people what did
[17:06] the Prophet say he said if one like it's
[17:10] the deaths not
[17:12] yeah we think we've got it all figured
[17:15] out
[17:16] what's your if you open up your mind
[17:19] enough to think about what I said
[17:21] that to understand that we did not
[17:25] understand the truth of one true and
[17:27] living God then now we can preach the
[17:30] rest of the night if you could
[17:33] understand that one little thing because
[17:35] then that one little thing will show you
[17:37] we didn't understand predestination
[17:40] you know predestination with a Baptist
[17:42] doctor Presbyterian and a Baptist you
[17:47] know that the the bat and I knew this in
[17:49] the Baptist Church you know that the
[17:51] Baptist Church was started by two
[17:53] brothers and they split the church over
[17:56] predestination and they come out of will
[18:05] well I'm glad I fell off there because I
[18:07] had to do that somewhere one of these
[18:10] days I had to do that so I'm glad I got
[18:11] that done that's predestination no
[18:16] that's stupidity accuse me but I'm
[18:23] getting a little point
[18:26] can you see you didn't understand one
[18:28] God
[18:30] can you see you didn't understand
[18:32] predestination and like I said did you
[18:36] understand the engrafting of the
[18:38] Gentiles that was not the mystery to be
[18:41] brought by the Prophet Paul brought the
[18:46] mystery of the engrafting of the
[18:48] Gentiles that's why you want to be in
[18:51] the message of truth I'm trying to lay
[18:55] down some little thoughts were your mind
[18:57] will think how many of us believed hell
[19:02] was eternal until we heard of the
[19:07] Prophet in other words
[19:12] we come into the message we've still
[19:14] brought living hell was eternal and we
[19:17] know that can't be true
[19:18] so what was eating down Paula I've never
[19:21] talked no eternal how old's or anything
[19:25] like that they never talked nothing on
[19:28] that line they talked the truth Paul
[19:31] talked the truth of predestination those
[19:33] who he foreknew he did predestinate that
[19:38] solves it that answers the whole thing
[19:43] you get anything in predestination fold
[19:44] over that scripture you're wrong how
[19:51] come the scripture says those who he
[19:55] foreknew he did predestinate so it goes
[19:58] to foreknowledge I see it took a prophet
[20:05] to figure them out listen these guys
[20:08] right here up to where you come in to
[20:12] here at Luther now these guys up here to
[20:14] the fourth church age they taught it
[20:16] correctly oh yeah that was enter runs of
[20:21] people and God trying to change them and
[20:24] get them to old messed up and everything
[20:26] but yet it never changed that church she
[20:31] stood on that word but then all of that
[20:35] was what was eat down he didn't take out
[20:37] the Bible where it says God and God and
[20:41] father of our Lord Jesus Christ that
[20:45] ain't - Lissy
[20:53] trying to get you to see what went out
[20:55] where you can see what come back in what
[20:59] went out was the understanding of the
[21:01] true revelation of one God the true
[21:03] revelation of predestination the true
[21:05] revelation of serpent seed Paul taught
[21:09] serpent seed and when I heard that and
[21:13] heard Brett around him and what he said
[21:15] I said oh glory
[21:17] no wonder them fire see so Jesus and we
[21:20] wouldn't born in adultery
[21:24] they knew what Sir Percy was that's what
[21:30] they told him we wasn't born in
[21:32] fornication like you let you see Church
[21:38] we didn't understand that it took the
[21:42] prophets message to open up in those
[21:45] things to what we could understand you
[21:49] know the prophets message in the basis
[21:51] of returning the ministry now give me a
[21:55] second on that part so what it was it
[21:57] was not up on the Ohio River
[21:59] that you that you gonna turn the hearts
[22:03] of the children back to the face of the
[22:04] father's God knew that was going to be
[22:05] in it but what'd he say he said your
[22:07] message will forerun the second coming
[22:12] all that I've taught you of one God
[22:15] water baptism predestination all brother
[22:18] and it's taught of this thing in the
[22:20] Statue of a perfect man was the faith of
[22:24] the father and he preached 30 something
[22:29] years for those two them things to be
[22:31] restored then God took him out on the
[22:36] back God took him up Aaron spoken words
[22:39] original seed
[22:40] I wish you'd listen to that message
[22:45] especially read it and just read it and
[22:49] look how beautiful and what he's laying
[22:52] out how that Mary had the two wounds how
[22:55] that this happened and that happened and
[22:57] how the bride and how she had to come to
[22:59] that place and in a little bit he says
[23:01] but Lord said I've got him out on the
[23:04] lil
[23:06] that's his words he said what can I do
[23:13] in other words he told it uh listen he
[23:16] taught it back up to where the faith of
[23:18] the fathers were standing there now you
[23:23] ain't gonna like this that's all right
[23:25] I've told you and I believe it if
[23:29] everybody in the world 7 billion people
[23:32] if ever person had the new birth exactly
[23:37] the way the Apostles taught it and the
[23:38] truth of it they would still be no
[23:41] change in the body because they was not
[23:43] one back down you can differ with that
[23:46] all you won't do but you better consider
[23:48] it well I got to face the fathers I'm
[23:54] ready for the rapture I've said this 40
[23:57] years ago and I keep saying it we've got
[24:00] to come to the faith of the fathers to
[24:02] be able to even understand what the
[24:03] seals are and especially like Daniel
[24:08] seventy weeks were brother Browns when
[24:09] it said it he said if you don't
[24:10] understand this he said then you can't
[24:14] understand the seals the vials of Wrath
[24:15] he said you can't understand it but
[24:18] nobody wants to know about 270 weeks of
[24:20] Daniel which hurt
[24:32] may I run through it 562 in stat in in
[24:37] spoken words original seat letter run
[24:39] saw that he had preached it right up to
[24:41] where the disciples were or did they
[24:43] preach one God he preached one go where
[24:45] they preached predestination he saw it
[24:47] was all laid in order but he saw there
[24:49] was no change in the body so he said
[24:52] lord I got him out on the limb what did
[24:53] he mean he had him out on the limb if
[24:58] there wasn't something to come forth it
[25:01] was all over with and this man was
[25:04] standing with the faith of the fathers
[25:06] the dead raised the sick healed he said
[25:11] where they preached one God I preached
[25:12] one God he was standing with the faith
[25:17] of the fathers but yet he knew he
[25:19] couldn't progress in the word why cause
[25:22] he thought he'd already finished it and
[25:26] when he did he said they got him out on
[25:31] the limb did what can I do the Lord said
[25:37] pick up your pen ain't gonna read all of
[25:40] what said I'm just gonna read just a
[25:45] little bit or if you want to follow me
[25:47] if they can get over to number five I
[25:48] hadn't asked them to if they can get the
[25:50] number five spot words reading they'll
[25:51] see paragraph 432 God has promised be
[25:55] careful God has promised now right above
[25:59] this is where he's first he tells him
[26:01] two times our brother and says that two
[26:03] times in the spoken word original see
[26:05] that God told him pick up his pen and
[26:07] write one of them is just back up above
[26:09] this cuz now you don't tell me what to
[26:12] do God has promised be careful God has
[26:15] promised Malachi for for this last days
[26:17] and Malachi for has not yet the medaka
[26:22] for has not yet has been fulfilled but
[26:26] it will be fulfilled
[26:27] it's a German ties Word of God spoken
[26:30] through Malachi the Prophet Jesus
[26:32] referred to it before the coming of the
[26:35] Cross the second coming said it must be
[26:37] fulfilled at that time belicoff for he
[26:40] says not fulfilled he thought he'd
[26:44] preached Malachi for
[26:48] going down to number six this is from
[26:52] the spoken word reading OC the messenger
[26:54] Malachi 4 will appear at God's appointed
[26:57] time we are looking for him we believe
[27:00] he will come that is according to his
[27:04] word now you know yourself he knew who
[27:09] he was but no prophet ever declared who
[27:13] he was right don't get confused on that
[27:15] he knew what he was doing but he didn't
[27:20] know that key it says as of yet Malachi
[27:24] fours not fulfilled
[27:25] God spoke straight to him and that's
[27:28] what I've asked you to do it if you
[27:30] won't do it then don't throw it back in
[27:32] my face
[27:33] read the spoken word original see and
[27:36] look what he's bringing it down and then
[27:39] God said pick up your pen and he picks
[27:41] up his pen and he goes right back over
[27:42] here and I can put you on the page and
[27:44] let you start reading again right down
[27:46] through there are the same thing he'd
[27:48] already told and God brought him right
[27:51] back to that spot and he stopped the
[27:53] second time that of yet there's no way
[27:55] there's no way your rapture could come
[28:00] what's he talking about he was talking
[28:06] about his message see then we'll get it
[28:10] one of these days they don't know how
[28:12] old River was a whole lot more than just
[28:14] his turn the faith of the fathers on the
[28:17] Ohio River was a voice speaking that
[28:20] says as John the Baptist for under SEC
[28:23] first coming your message and then say
[28:29] the Apostles message your message will
[28:33] forerun now we better remember one thing
[28:37] especially on internet he's in no way in
[28:40] the world am i teaching they brought a
[28:42] runs message if something extra added to
[28:45] the Bible because it can't be it's got
[28:47] to be in the book so get that right now
[28:49] don't go tell somebody that I'm saying
[28:51] that there's something different to come
[28:52] no it's something out of the message
[28:54] it's something that was not explained
[28:57] but will be explained
[28:59] okay listen go under number seven just
[29:06] about six months after that I had my
[29:09] first baptism down here on the river
[29:11] when the light came down right at Spring
[29:14] Street many of you people might want to
[29:18] go down and take a look at it I like
[29:20] this one because I've never seen I never
[29:22] heard him say that his point are you
[29:26] risen look have you ever heard him say
[29:30] go down there and see it I mean come on
[29:33] have you ever heard him say I wish you'd
[29:35] go down there and see on Ohio River look
[29:37] what he says many of you people might
[29:41] want to go down and take a look at it
[29:45] he's getting personal in there there's
[29:48] where the angel of the Lord appeared in
[29:49] public first at two o'clock one
[29:52] afternoon and a voice came from it said
[29:56] as john the baptist was sent to forerun
[29:58] the first coming of Christ your message
[30:02] will forerun the second coming this is
[30:08] 30 years later and Here I am still
[30:11] tonight proclaiming that message and
[30:14] around the world if went and I'm glad to
[30:18] be back in my hometown tonight to
[30:20] represent this Lord Jesus Christ when
[30:22] was that seed not our to show up 1965
[30:26] let me give you these and then we'll
[30:28] quit he says when the message first
[30:33] started out of course everybody was
[30:34] praying for the sick great signs and
[30:36] wonders it started specially in the
[30:38] Pentecostal people a universal revival
[30:41] and healing campaigns that swept the
[30:42] world and revivals will never hand look
[30:49] on the seed not out with a shot they
[30:50] still reading right on down paragraph 29
[30:52] where we at but when he sat down one day
[30:56] now remember that's where he was
[30:57] describing what happened I and my father
[31:01] one that was more than they could stand
[31:04] it was also when he said except you eat
[31:07] the flesh of the son of man and drink
[31:09] his blood you have no life in you
[31:12] they couldn't understand that there was
[31:15] no way they could follow that time with
[31:18] a message that always follows ever sign
[31:21] because the voice was the sign has a
[31:24] voice
[31:25] alright the force of the sign 1964 we're
[31:29] told that in the last days that will
[31:31] appear again there's going to be a
[31:33] message come forth that will introduce
[31:35] the Messiah to the people and it'll be
[31:38] in such a way they stand dumbfounded
[31:40] like they did then he promised it in the
[31:43] next chapter
[31:44] alright listen to these now let's get it
[31:45] faced off the message trying to do is
[31:48] guard a service I've always told you
[31:50] I've always told it believe it the
[31:53] brother Browns message never begun with
[31:55] the disciples that was the disciples
[31:57] ministry being restored
[31:59] that was the restoring of the whole
[32:00] thing his message began in the opening
[32:03] of the sealed right at that little
[32:04] balance period maybe coming up close
[32:06] because especially if he gets spoken
[32:08] word original see then he gets in is
[32:11] this the sign of the end time serve and
[32:14] he goes backwards and forth on sign of
[32:17] the end times read it he'll go backwards
[32:19] and forth look like saying it's here
[32:20] then he'll look like he's saying it's
[32:22] coming he look like he's saying this
[32:23] here he looked like he said cause idiot
[32:25] see sometimes he's saying some things he
[32:27] ain't and he's done preaching it now
[32:31] look so what we get to them 7mr be
[32:36] revealed in the last days when the seven
[32:38] angels seventh angels message when he
[32:40] not when he starts out doing this but
[32:44] when he begins to sound his message see
[32:46] not two years in preparation but when he
[32:49] begins to sound the message these
[32:51] mysteries then will be revealed and here
[32:53] they are now
[32:54] not knowing them and you people are a
[32:56] witness okay that's all for what that's
[32:59] off the message trying to do God a
[33:02] service without his will
[33:04] alright here we go to work since birth
[33:06] Express now that was sixty four five
[33:08] here 65 works is faith Express that
[33:12] brings us to Pais today because we have
[33:15] faith and I know this is of God is
[33:18] because this and other scriptures point
[33:20] to this our revelation 10 said that in
[33:23] the hour of the seventh angel
[33:26] message when he begins to sound forth
[33:28] his message not in a healing service but
[33:32] the message that follows the healing
[33:33] service he's placing it so much until
[33:38] you can't argue the point look at the
[33:39] next one
[33:40] I have heard but now I see 1965 11 27
[33:43] and when he promised at the hour of the
[33:46] seven angels message the seven seals
[33:49] would be revealed and the misters of God
[33:52] would be declared revelations 10 when
[33:54] the seventh angel begins to sound his
[33:56] message not the healing service the
[33:59] message that follows the healing service
[34:04] now you know he had a healing server you
[34:06] know all that but then there was a
[34:07] message because there's a voice to go
[34:10] with that all right go to the next one
[34:12] on the rapture I love this one now here
[34:18] also taught that the seven churches
[34:19] which is revelation 10 7 that the great
[34:22] mystery of the book was to be unfolded
[34:23] by the seventh angels message now
[34:26] there's a messenger above always and
[34:29] above and always a messenger on earth
[34:32] even get them to straight and find out
[34:34] what it is God was bringing his word
[34:36] down to the Prophet the English word
[34:39] angel means a messenger and the seventh
[34:42] angels message and in excuse me the
[34:45] seventh angels message while he was
[34:47] making his proclaiming his ministry then
[34:50] when he began to stand and stand forth
[34:52] his minute sound forth his ministry not
[34:55] when he started out Jesus when he
[34:58] started out he started healing the sick
[35:00] and afflicted oh that great rabbi he's a
[35:02] prophet everybody wanted him in his
[35:06] church but when he sat down one day and
[35:09] said I and my father are one that was
[35:12] different that was different and except
[35:16] you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and
[35:18] drink his blood you have no life in you
[35:20] rolling it on
[35:27] huh yeah maybe I can do it from here
[35:31] basically always father seven things was
[35:33] amazing Jesus when he started out okay
[35:37] that's it he started healing this sick a
[35:40] great prophet but when he sat down one
[35:43] day and said on my father one now the
[35:45] scripture says I mean the Prophet went
[35:47] on into another message he said when you
[35:51] begin to say I and my father's one he
[35:54] said the church will pull away from you
[35:56] now I'd be glad to find that one for you
[35:59] but here's one more off the message is
[36:07] this sign of this fist the sign of the
[36:10] in sir right out of a pricey day where
[36:18] there hadn't been been rained for weeks
[36:21] here he come with a rower and said as
[36:25] John the Baptist was sent forth to
[36:27] forerun the first coming of Christ
[36:30] you're sent forth with a message to
[36:33] forerun the second coming of Christ he
[36:39] was sent with a message his message is
[36:42] not and I got another one off on the
[36:44] rapture that's why I pulled that one but
[36:51] that should be enough for you to know
[36:53] where I'm standing anyway to understand
[36:55] why I believe it because it's not in the
[36:58] years of preparation and to think I'm a
[37:00] musician not in the years of all of that
[37:03] all of that was faith of the father's
[37:05] being restored but one day that prophet
[37:08] spoke the word original seed he said I
[37:10] love you yet Malachi fourth he set out
[37:12] right then to find out what about
[37:15] Malachi four it wouldn't be just a
[37:17] little while he was sent west and he
[37:22] come back to bring his message because
[37:25] listen the seals was not restoration
[37:31] seals was not restoration show me
[37:34] Steel's was something that mankind had
[37:37] never seen
[37:38] you remember you don't go with the
[37:40] Prophet we worked up top off the pyramid
[37:42] you know look down in he said light
[37:46] never shined on this brother branham
[37:49] stood dar with a message his message
[37:52] would full run their second coming of
[37:54] Jesus Christ I'm gonna save this
[37:58] statement to you so you get this one now
[38:01] see that's why I've always believed
[38:03] those seven seals is the message that
[38:08] the Prophet was to bring those it was
[38:10] something that was not known before
[38:13] before all right let's see now it's
[38:17] known because it's the opening of the
[38:21] word there ain't nothing to be opened by
[38:23] the side besides the seven seals would
[38:26] you admit that I mean would you admit
[38:29] that just in your mind and take it home
[38:30] we there ain't nothing beside the seven
[38:32] seals to be revealed because you say
[38:34] well now wait a minute days this third
[38:36] pool is a it's all in the seven seals
[38:38] marriage and divorce was revealed in
[38:40] seven sealed surface he's revealed in
[38:42] the southern sea everything was really
[38:44] nothing revealed it ain't revealed in
[38:46] the seven seals now come on get the
[38:48] message right but then you'll see that
[38:50] was his message his message was to bring
[38:54] those seven seals that is the head stone
[39:00] to me why would I want another head
[39:05] stone beside the revealing of the
[39:08] positive word therefore leaving the
[39:11] principles I didn't finish that message
[39:13] the other day right therefore leaving
[39:14] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[39:16] let us go on to perfection
[39:20] let's go on to completion
[39:23] right I thought brother Brennan said the
[39:27] Seventh Seal was the finish of all
[39:29] things I thought he said the seventh
[39:31] seal was the completion of all times why
[39:35] are we looking for something else I
[39:38] don't mind saying it I don't want no
[39:41] problem
[39:41] could you see I faced it's all the way
[39:43] back you say well now what do you think
[39:45] about the tenth brother Dale I don't
[39:47] know
[39:49] blind language you don't either
[39:52] because you're talking about something
[39:54] that a prophet said but I'm not sitting
[40:02] down waiting now anybody's known me for
[40:06] all of these 40 years some of you know
[40:07] me 50 years and you know one thing for
[40:10] sure learning them sitting back there
[40:12] they were there today I was baptized you
[40:14] know I stopped
[40:16] I ain't backed up one step
[40:19] I still believe today when I believe in
[40:23] brother Branham can come back and go
[40:26] across the country and preach but it'll
[40:29] be after the resurrection because
[40:30] there's no way to bring him up before
[40:32] the resurrection because you're making
[40:34] him deity if you try to bring him up to
[40:36] where there's nothing on now don't make
[40:38] him deity take it to any if he can raise
[40:41] and preach across the land for 30 40 day
[40:44] you mean we're gonna sit around in that
[40:45] 30 40 days after the resurrection Oh
[40:48] glory hallelujah direction the
[40:51] resurrections come wait good 3040 days
[40:58] we're gonna have such a wonderful
[40:59] opportunity the weekend traveling I
[41:05] thought we can go to Jeffersonville any
[41:09] time we want to or we can go to
[41:11] California anytime we want we can go
[41:15] anywhere we want to cause we can travel
[41:17] like I thought that's all I've ever told
[41:20] all I've ever contended the world is
[41:26] real this message is the only message
[41:30] with life it's not a message must and
[41:38] unless there's a voice to speak with
[41:41] that message and declare the message to
[41:44] be true there is no hoax outside of this
[41:47] message that's all I've ever said it's
[41:53] all I've ever contended let's get in the
[41:56] message I've always said it and that's
[41:59] what I said I ain't backing up this is
[42:02] what I say
[42:02] if you're saying well brother Browning's
[42:04] got to come back
[42:05] realize there's got to be me and you to
[42:07] get to a place to be wet ready to
[42:11] receive it now I can quote brother
[42:14] branham if you want to get into it
[42:15] you want to go with me and spoken word
[42:18] original seed how that the Prophet was
[42:20] taken back here and this happened to
[42:22] that away you better remember that but
[42:25] just remember if it don't come according
[42:33] to the word we've missed it he said well
[42:39] you just don't say no that's the one
[42:41] thing don't talk to me about it because
[42:44] I'm beyond all talking to that pray for
[42:47] me he said brother de la but one thing
[42:50] that I believe has got to be done and
[42:52] that's the new name of Jesus today I
[42:59] suppose be revealed in the thunders
[43:09] let's quote brother Brandon he said it
[43:13] might be made known when we get to
[43:19] that's no the Lancer that's just stating
[43:22] him he said it might be made known when
[43:25] I get there what do you need a new name
[43:26] for so you're making it to be some kind
[43:31] of something that there's got to be some
[43:33] mysterious something that you don't
[43:35] understand let's get in the message and
[43:38] take what the prophet has told us and
[43:40] we'll be ready for whatever takes place
[43:46] most of you know what happened a couple
[43:48] of years in a row or not years but time
[43:51] everybody was over in the fellowship
[43:53] meetings and they were saying oh we got
[43:55] to have a woman president he's got to be
[43:57] this prophet said and what we're
[43:59] president you know I got up over one
[44:02] time and I told him I said all y'all
[44:03] talking about distant woman got to be a
[44:05] president but I said you want me tell
[44:07] you who's gonna be President they just
[44:11] all shut up I said you won't dust at the
[44:12] Lord or they did Drive that's cause I'm
[44:17] gonna tell what the Bible say he said I
[44:21] put in Kings and I take out Kings
[44:23] so whoever God wants in the White House
[44:26] is gonna be in the White House he's got
[44:29] to wonder now for the way it's supposed
[44:31] to be he had Obama to bring it to the
[44:34] basis he got this one now why do we want
[44:36] to argue about what's going on
[44:38] I don't care who's president it'll be
[44:42] who God wants to be is that any problem
[44:47] I mean I think he's playing common sense
[44:52] God's gonna put in the office right go
[44:55] ahead and anybody have a need in with
[44:57] him now be careful on the way home but
[45:00] if anybody have indeed come brother ray
