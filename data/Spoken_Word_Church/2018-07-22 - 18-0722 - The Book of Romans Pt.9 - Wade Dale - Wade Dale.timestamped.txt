[0:00] so we will begin to have our brothers in
[0:08] exercise some of that five fold we've
[0:11] been talking about that's right so
[0:13] that's five fold ministry and we are
[0:19] rough huh I don't have my pad yet but
[0:23] I'll have my up and I'm getting a lot of
[0:25] it so brother Anderson brother Anderson
[0:29] he when he gave it to me he and I
[0:32] remember and you go in and help because
[0:33] last gonna go buy another mean John was
[0:35] gonna go trying to take it out before I
[0:37] have it fixed and you said something
[0:40] about he usually maybe you all continue
[0:41] to be you should be got an apple cap
[0:43] last part of my memory and I remember
[0:45] Anderson said I got Apple care on the
[0:48] thing when I bought it for so having
[0:52] Apple Care course just been a fiasco
[0:55] trying to get them to get to the people
[0:57] but I'm but hey I'm getting a free iPad
[1:03] so there's Antonia you know we'll get
[1:06] back started on that but first my
[1:09] animals will say when I called him he
[1:11] said I know you drop it
[1:28] no I don't know
[1:39] this thing's it's covered till December
[1:42] of nineteen so I've got it so you're
[1:45] good
[1:45] oh man I'm just not gonna get another
[1:48] rum what the problem was to let someone
[1:51] come in what the problem I remember that
[1:52] day I opened it up with a bottom part
[1:54] with the keypad if you ever get one it's
[1:57] neat to have one with the magnet but if
[2:00] nothing ever detaches it did what it did
[2:03] that day fell off so I'm gonna get a
[2:05] whole nother kinda like what Jim's got
[2:07] there that's solid the way when you open
[2:09] it up and it stays together and it was
[2:12] funny it was neat to have the magnet
[2:14] because you could take it out on the leg
[2:15] down and do your you know on the plane
[2:17] and put it back together but it didn't
[2:19] work that nice so won't get another room
[2:21] I'm gonna get one of those otter
[2:25] defenders where you can throw into Lane
[2:31] not want any of that going on for bridge
[2:35] all right let's go we're going to go to
[2:37] Romans chapter 4 we're going to go into
[2:39] Bible again because we don't have our
[2:41] screen up but we've been in Romans 4
[2:47] talking about circumcision on
[2:49] circumcision now but what we're doing is
[2:52] is we're looking at now Roman 4 we read
[2:55] last week talking about what Paul is
[3:00] looking back to Abraham yes sir look cut
[3:08] will it connect and you got the Bible on
[3:10] there if you want to yell let's not do
[3:17] it this way
[3:17] yeah it's okay I don't want I don't want
[3:19] I want to flow through this but thank
[3:22] you I appreciate that I love all these
[3:24] brothers trying to help a man and they
[3:28] do a lot of work
[3:32] yes no that ain't no down they know that
[3:35] I'm that won't hit all the time so
[3:39] justification though remember when we
[3:43] talk about justification in the seals
[3:45] justification is not what you do and
[3:47] don't do
[3:49] it's all hi grace migration we saved
[3:52] through faith through faith that's my
[3:54] name now that's what Paul's talking
[3:56] about Romans remember he's getting ready
[3:58] to go to Rome so he's gonna have to deal
[4:00] with the heathen Romans and he's got the
[4:02] deal and also the Christian Romans and
[4:05] he's telling them sit luck to be
[4:08] physically circumcised or physically on
[4:11] a certain size means nothing to die at
[4:13] this point now before and Old Testament
[4:17] it was a sign but it wasn't it wasn't a
[4:21] sign it wasn't a sign that everything
[4:27] was fine because a lot of people were
[4:30] certain style murders long these little
[4:33] circumcised
[4:34] David will circumcise a man he was a
[4:38] physical circumcised did but he was a
[4:40] murderer an adulterer
[4:42] a liar right so that certain things it
[4:46] didn't matter need for every covers
[4:48] David just a little one than what even
[4:50] verse six even as david also describeth
[4:53] the blessedness of the man who died in
[4:55] few rights and this network david ought
[4:57] to know that david oughta know that
[4:59] there was righteousness in feuding
[5:01] without works because under david works
[5:03] he was david under David's work he
[5:07] should have been killed
[5:08] tell me mother murder and a adulterer
[5:11] but remember God knew his heart that's
[5:14] why I when we get into the fifth seal
[5:16] we're gonna see something that's this
[5:18] really fantastic about the grace of God
[5:21] giving eternal life to a group of people
[5:23] that did not want
[5:27] the fifth seal cube rejected Christ but
[5:31] in rejecting Christ Christ got a Gentile
[5:34] bride and that's what he was looking for
[5:36] to start with say listen God didn't have
[5:38] to change his plan he knew that Israel
[5:41] would go whoring he knew that Israel
[5:43] would would go after other men other
[5:45] mates adult idolatry turns into adultery
[5:50] okay and it does because when you
[5:53] idolize a woman or a man then then you
[5:55] can commit adultery wasn't really easy
[5:57] when you I wanted that person alright so
[5:59] natural types of spiritually so in the
[6:02] Old Testament he knew his rule was gonna
[6:04] go after but Bale and all those other
[6:08] Moloch coming they got well they were
[6:11] sacrificing their own kids to this to
[6:14] this God you know put them in the fire
[6:16] the Bible even talks about you know
[6:18] putting through the father their
[6:19] children so they must have believed in
[6:21] this God pretty day but so they rejected
[6:23] him but God knew that a Gentile ground
[6:26] that's what the Jews are staunch I know
[6:28] that the Jews are they have their place
[6:30] but the Jews have to have signs and
[6:33] wonders the Jews have that's why when
[6:35] Moses then allowed to go over to Israel
[6:37] sure they're going to preach the word
[6:39] but they're going to be able to call
[6:41] anything they want to and those 144,000
[6:45] are going to see that they're going to
[6:47] respond to it right where a Gentile just
[6:52] does like the Centurion whatever you say
[6:55] Lord you don't have to come to my house
[6:56] but in Nigeria the Jew coming in lay
[7:00] hands oh my oh my child you don't come
[7:02] in no you don't need that yes so that's
[7:05] what God wanted because remember Abraham
[7:08] got it by faith Abraham got it by faith
[7:12] and then what he done was he believed
[7:14] what God told me and a sign of
[7:17] circumcision came into view I have to
[7:21] really believe an unknown voice telling
[7:24] me to circumcise myself in
[7:26] your goal right yeah us guys know what
[7:30] we're talking about and he did it
[7:32] himself he didn't get knocked out with
[7:34] novocaine and some doctors know the
[7:36] volatility did it itself so you see what
[7:38] I mean even a natural act of that of
[7:41] that kind of took faith first right
[7:46] we'll see it was revealed that a man it
[7:48] was revealed that Abraham that he was
[7:49] going to have that child but now
[7:51] remember it was it but it was
[7:52] withholding because remember you can get
[7:55] a revelation and then there's a
[7:56] revelation behind that revelation
[7:59] brother i'm cinda is a revelation about
[8:02] a supernatural element despite the
[8:04] revelation will Abraham supernatural
[8:06] revelation he didn't get wasn't even
[8:08] don't have it by Sarah that was a
[8:12] supernatural revelation if he would have
[8:13] known he's gonna have a my Sarah to
[8:14] begin with you starting with Sarah but
[8:17] Israel but his revelation was he's gonna
[8:19] have a child
[8:20] well there's Hagar I can still do what
[8:23] I'm doing she can still deal with she's
[8:24] young girl so let me help you God will
[8:27] see that time it won't end that was no
[8:28] guide to all no help anyone he was gonna
[8:32] have it through Sarah but you know what
[8:34] he still went Abraham do what he did
[8:37] because remember when you go down to the
[8:39] end of the road I bet you Abraham that's
[8:42] not report in a Bible but Abraham being
[8:44] a human man he said man I messed up when
[8:49] he mail Melchizedek and he finally says
[8:50] you're gonna have that child by Sarah in
[8:53] the time of life the next 28 days the
[8:56] next cycle you're gonna have fuel and
[8:59] even having cycles at the time the God
[9:01] was just telling him in 28 days y'all
[9:03] gonna turn back into a young person and
[9:06] y'all gonna have a baby
[9:07] we'll see if I that time Abraham said
[9:11] stupid name if you know me really like
[9:14] I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean
[9:17] that I didn't mean them to fall down on
[9:20] my face and laugh and I didn't mean to
[9:21] try to give my life away yet he didn't
[9:23] give after even after the change trying
[9:25] to give it away
[9:27] and that just shows them the frailness
[9:31] of our human nature without the baptism
[9:34] of the Holy Ghost with the Holy Ghost he
[9:36] would have never done that and then so
[9:38] but there had to be that tight because
[9:41] God saw a Gentile right right so he's
[9:44] had to physically physically blind the
[9:46] eyes of the Jews put his hand right over
[9:49] their eyes and say you can't see me
[9:53] until I take the Gentile bride and then
[9:56] I'll erase your iniquity with 144,000
[10:00] and I'll put your tribes back in order
[10:02] I'm going to send you two prophets and
[10:04] then you're going to be not Brad anymore
[10:06] but you're going to be service to the
[10:08] bride you're going to be in the temple
[10:09] you're gonna be in this they'll be the
[10:11] only ones in the city all right besides
[10:13] the bride the bride of nine 44,000 all
[10:15] of them will be in that city okay
[10:18] the rest have to come in and go out and
[10:20] come in and go I know I meet brother
[10:25] clock we're talking about something the
[10:26] other day and I kind of like his analogy
[10:27] I mean it's not it's biblical but
[10:30] there's no clothes or anything but the
[10:32] Bible says it came to brain one their
[10:34] brain quite in other words you didn't
[10:36] say timing but they'll bring the stuff
[10:38] into the city and leave with a leaf came
[10:43] to the earth what are they coming in for
[10:44] pay their time we will live up the tide
[10:47] of the plan from the people on the
[10:50] outside just like to leave us were
[10:52] supposed to have food just like down
[10:53] with tonight the other day the Levitical
[10:55] priesthood was never supposed to be a
[10:56] trial ever it was it was set apart
[11:01] remember he give all these other people
[11:03] something and then Levi said well what
[11:05] the Lord said found your portion right
[11:07] why because these twelve tribes paid a
[11:11] tenth to the Levi and they lived off of
[11:13] that dude right so what will happen this
[11:17] will be the new city will be the
[11:19] Levitical priests to the highest order
[11:21] right you got 12 tribes our nation's
[11:24] because
[11:24] brother Brown said they would be
[11:26] politics outside because it's a king
[11:27] they okay so it's gonna be different out
[11:30] there than it is in the city in the city
[11:33] it's going to be us and
[11:35] 34,000 and we got one King King Jesus
[11:39] but they will bribe them the Bible says
[11:41] the kings of the earth will come in to
[11:44] bring their timely well what if they
[11:45] didn't raise the beans and potatoes in
[11:47] the characters we don't have to eat but
[11:48] you know what I'd like to eat I still
[11:51] don't like to eat and they bring those
[11:53] timing in and give it to us and all the
[11:54] people wouldn't stick only one photo so
[11:56] I think it he just really think
[11:58] continuity with what the Bible tell us
[11:59] as the Levitical priesthood lived off of
[12:01] they go Kyle enough people but over him
[12:07] the faith of Abraham folk we got a
[12:09] couple about now but remember we cut
[12:11] down to about verse 16 let's go back up
[12:14] to 13 because Paul's trying to describe
[12:20] something there watch for the promise
[12:22] that he should be the heir of the world
[12:24] was not to Abraham or his seed to the
[12:27] law in other words to his loins never
[12:30] there's God to have a kingdom set up by
[12:38] sexual activity just put it that way
[12:41] right
[12:42] no it's by like I saw the womb of our
[12:45] mind God comes into the womb of our mind
[12:47] plants to see work of God and that's the
[12:49] way we were supposed to grow that we
[12:50] were supposed to come in the garden
[12:52] we're supposed to come by natural after
[12:55] that all right so that's what we're
[12:56] doing now we're coming exactly the way
[12:58] we were supposed to all right it's by
[13:00] the seed word of doctor blood it was a
[13:02] mate to them to pay for him or his seed
[13:05] bring to the wall the law was man and
[13:09] woman gets together they have children
[13:12] now listen that's contrary to God
[13:15] because you're going to see in just a
[13:17] minute that says in verse 14 of chapter
[13:20] 5 says never let death reigned from Adam
[13:23] to Moses okay
[13:26] that's when we had to have a second Adam
[13:28] born under the law but to bring us out
[13:31] from under the law everybody all right
[13:32] with that
[13:33] it says but through the righteousness of
[13:35] faith for if they which are of the law
[13:38] be heirs faith is made boy
[13:41] in other words
[13:44] means you know child named Josh Josh
[13:46] gets tired inheritance that ain't faith
[13:48] that's fit the path that's not faith but
[13:53] the faith is isn't that a canard to get
[13:56] something from me not being that air
[13:58] physical though being a spiritual heir
[14:01] she can get something from me now that's
[14:03] them not the less when all is we we
[14:06] glean our our inheritance comes through
[14:10] the fivefold ministry I say dream not
[14:13] from through the five whole minutes not
[14:17] from the five oh man and over that don't
[14:19] make us God we have no inheritance hey
[14:21] sailor
[14:22] preaching the gospel to you and then
[14:24] what we're taught as you go ahead
[14:28] pursuit of Christ not to ministry but
[14:30] when Christ comes through the ministry
[14:31] then he distributes be distribute all of
[14:36] our inheritance through the ministry
[14:38] okay that's why we have an inheritance
[14:41] incorruptible all these other inherits
[14:43] that you get it can be billions of
[14:45] dollars one day I mean some else are
[14:48] talking not too long ago you know
[14:50] somebody said well he's got deep pockets
[14:52] I said yeah but it doesn't have a bottom
[14:54] in it might be real deep but you know
[14:57] what little bottom in that party around
[14:59] there so there's some money there's a
[15:01] there's a there's a end of the pocket
[15:04] but with God it's eternity so I mean you
[15:08] just keep getting and getting getting
[15:09] again okay
[15:10] that's why we have an inheritance
[15:12] eternal in the heavens the Bible says
[15:14] what heavenly place it for they which
[15:17] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[15:19] boy Abraham given additional give it a
[15:22] listen
[15:22] that that's just you don't have to have
[15:25] faith you know if mom and dad passed
[15:30] away I wouldn't have to have faith I
[15:33] just go read the will go down a part of
[15:37] their lineage all right so look
[15:42] cut buddy righteous that the law be
[15:44] heirs faith is made void and the promise
[15:47] made them not affect because they'll all
[15:52] work at the raft we see that for where
[15:55] no law is there is no transgression
[15:57] so they'll all had to come therefore it
[16:00] is a faith that it might be by grace
[16:05] what grace not anything you did to the
[16:08] end the promise might be sure to all the
[16:11] seed and I told you I circled back and
[16:13] put Genesis 1:26 go he's not come back
[16:16] natural seed it's done by spiritual seed
[16:19] that let us make man in our own image
[16:21] and after our likeness that never came
[16:23] through the loins of a man or a woman
[16:27] natural it came from God Almighty spoken
[16:31] work okay they might be sure to all the
[16:35] seed not to that only which is the
[16:38] little law but to that also witches of
[16:40] the faith of Abraham who is the father
[16:43] of us all now he's not the father
[16:45] nervous sitting in this room that I know
[16:47] of physically but spiritually he's our
[16:51] Father why because we have faith we have
[16:53] to believe I have to believe I'm in
[16:56] there okay but I know when I read the
[16:59] widow and says no matters and joint
[17:01] heirs with Christ and if I have Christ
[17:02] living in me and I become part of the
[17:04] kingdom or part of the family I get my
[17:06] inheritance I don't have to tell face
[17:08] for that makes a lot of things you don't
[17:11] have to have faithful holy I faith for a
[17:16] rapture no have faith for up
[17:17] resurrection
[17:20] the rapture will take place because of
[17:22] that man
[17:24] you know this I'll see you in the
[17:27] rapture things okay but I want to see
[17:29] the devoman this once and dance among us
[17:31] what's the dance among us the rapture
[17:33] will take place but until the Dead come
[17:36] up until there's a resurrection message
[17:39] preached no one will come up with people
[17:41] emigrate see that's our inheritance our
[17:46] inheritance it's not going to the
[17:47] graveyard and put them in the grave I
[17:49] don't Hera pictures what eternal life to
[17:55] make this body eternal verse 17 know
[17:58] what's he's interpolated now watch him
[18:00] he's going to interpolate here cut it
[18:02] the father of us all as it is written
[18:05] now let's go back if you look in your
[18:07] scope in the Bible if you don't go back
[18:09] justice 17:5 God said I have made thee a
[18:13] father of many nations now right there
[18:16] at that point in time he didn't have him
[18:19] he didn't how child warned by promise in
[18:22] other words how they went was coming but
[18:25] he went there yet before him whom he
[18:29] believed even God who quickeneth the
[18:31] dead and call it those things which are
[18:34] not as though they were who against hope
[18:38] believed in hope everything was against
[18:41] Abraham having the child everything
[18:44] physical was against Abraham having
[18:46] child all right
[18:48] physically he could not produce but he
[18:51] believed in what God said see that he
[18:53] might become the father of many nations
[18:54] according to that which was spoken so
[18:58] shall thy seed be and I wrote my Bible
[19:01] us that is not now Abraham's natural
[19:06] lineage that's his spiritual lineage
[19:09] alright and being not weak and faint no
[19:13] wait a minute father
[19:15] wait a minute Paul be not weak in faith
[19:18] he considered not his own body now dead
[19:22] when he was about a hundred years old
[19:25] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[19:28] he staggered not
[19:31] now if we go read the commentary he did
[19:34] stay if we read the law he staggered but
[19:42] you bring the law over through Christ
[19:44] and bringing through the blood and watch
[19:45] what Paul said he staggered not at the
[19:48] promise of God through unbelief but was
[19:52] strong in faith giving glory to God and
[19:54] look here and being fully persuaded and
[20:00] being fully persuaded that what he had
[20:04] promised he was able also to perform
[20:09] because God had to perform first yeah
[20:12] change his body a man before able help
[20:15] to bring though the natural part the
[20:17] promise into effect and therefore T was
[20:21] imputed to him for righteousness in
[20:23] other words our faith can weigh a long
[20:26] time dormant Abraham's faith laid a long
[20:33] time dormant went through ups and downs
[20:34] and ins and outs and bad days and good
[20:36] day
[20:37] but still you've got to see what he's
[20:39] there being fully persuaded therefore it
[20:41] was imputed to him for Isis what do you
[20:42] gotta do doctor okay Abraham I know
[20:44] you're the only person on this earth is
[20:46] gonna listen to me - it's full those who
[20:48] endure to the end I think we're in don't
[20:52] listen those who endure to the end shall
[20:54] be safe Abraham endured God you ain't
[20:57] listened to me God knew Abraham would be
[20:59] the only person on the earth that would
[21:03] endure what he endured and have that
[21:05] child if not he's here to pick somebody
[21:08] else so I said about brother Branham if
[21:11] they be by helpful to fit that mold for
[21:13] the church age messenger it would have
[21:14] been them but it was william my friend
[21:16] he fit the mold so I said all right here
[21:19] it is so we gave him the gift because
[21:24] you know why do you can handle it God
[21:25] will not give you a gift that you can't
[21:27] handle they even press yourself anything
[21:29] but at the end can consider the end of
[21:33] the conversation he just Christ the same
[21:35] yesterday
[21:36] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[21:39] actions no one does that word imputing
[21:41] are reckoned in other words God knew he
[21:44] would make it to the end did what God
[21:47] said and have a child
[21:48] now that same way with you and I you
[21:50] know I don't know that we go through the
[21:52] ups and downs and ins and outs and all
[21:54] this other stuff but those who endure to
[21:56] the end shall be safe now it was not
[21:59] written for his sake alone
[22:02] that was imputed to him all of what he's
[22:05] saying but for us also
[22:09] now watch gives that big old word with a
[22:13] huge meaning but for us also to whom
[22:17] that it shall be imputed yeah you know
[22:22] every time in the Bible pretty much that
[22:23] I Circle that word because that word is
[22:26] yeah that means you have a free moral
[22:29] Andersen yes yes this charts the time
[22:33] we're not gonna be absolved yes then we
[22:35] have similes in little bitty words are
[22:37] so profound if we believe on him that
[22:41] raised up Jesus I was working that night
[22:43] and said we believe everything no it's a
[22:46] few believing that Graham he's bringing
[22:50] in arrived to today but for us also to
[22:54] him it shall be imputed if we believe on
[22:56] him that raised up Jesus our Lord from
[22:58] the dead who was delivered for our
[23:00] offenses and was raised again I serve
[23:05] them didn't put in the end time come
[23:07] back for us the first resurrection was
[23:11] fine that gave us eternal life the
[23:14] second resurrection of the Son of Man in
[23:16] the end time was gonna change our body
[23:18] amen my man
[23:21] people don't get excited about that
[23:23] anymore I get excited about my team this
[23:25] is get over he was raised again for what
[23:29] our justification
[23:30] those who he's justified he's already 45
[23:34] Paul's telling you around here this is
[23:36] where he's getting it all from
[23:37] those who he's justified he's already
[23:39] fortified all right so look now let's a
[23:42] little bit of a chapter
[23:43] stop therefore being justified by faith
[23:48] not by works how in the world can we
[23:51] justify ourselves we cannot we have to
[23:54] depend on God's justification therefore
[23:57] then the Bible says the justifier and
[23:59] the justified is the same because if I'm
[24:03] justified by Christ it's him not me but
[24:06] I'm an heir of that so I get what do you
[24:09] get so I just I like we're brother any
[24:12] single time I I have attached myself to
[24:14] the eternal that's why I have attached
[24:17] myself to the eternal so I like that
[24:19] therefore being justified by faith we
[24:22] have peace with God through our Lord
[24:23] Jesus Christ look by whom also we have
[24:27] access by faith into this grace wherein
[24:32] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[24:35] glory of God and not only so but we
[24:41] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[24:45] tribulation worketh patience and
[24:48] patience experience and experience hope
[24:53] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[24:57] love of God is she'd abroad in our
[24:59] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[25:01] unto us more for when we were yet
[25:05] without strength remember the law had no
[25:09] strength said just to condemn me and
[25:11] that's all and no strength to get you
[25:13] out from under well when we were yet
[25:16] without strength in due time Christ died
[25:19] for the ungodly
[25:20] yes actually I like what I like what
[25:26] Scofield says down here the man he says
[25:28] death is universal oh God send us
[25:33] infants moral people religious people
[25:35] equally with the DES frame so Navajo
[25:40] lies where he's been come back in Adam
[25:42] all died what because of the Train
[25:44] Christian of Adam we all died well the
[25:45] one the second come took away of
[25:47] transgression when he said it Spanish
[25:51] nothing you just gotta believe it's been
[25:53] a man but scarcely look we're scarcely
[25:57] for a righteous man will one die no
[26:02] words I've given my life for Aaron but
[26:06] if it's something he does that's his
[26:09] home
[26:10] ICMP you see what I'm saying yes that's
[26:13] human beings would say okay I'll give my
[26:14] life for brother Louise I'll knock him
[26:16] out a little later but now if you've
[26:17] done something last week don't look like
[26:19] them I with condition constant get on
[26:24] the cross and say well if they'll
[26:25] believe me no he died without condition
[26:29] he gave us life without condition no
[26:31] although one condition if you believe in
[26:33] me I'll give you eternal life that's
[26:36] that's only condition there is because
[26:38] for scarcely for a righteous man will
[26:40] one died yet pre adventure for a good
[26:43] man some would even dare to die okay for
[26:45] a good man you would but now what the
[26:47] problem is they just put you in the
[26:49] grave insane he was a good soldier
[26:52] he gave this you know we'll give him the
[26:54] Purple Heart well that means nothing to
[26:57] assault you know they could be a good
[27:00] man pushing me out of the way get run
[27:04] over and kill but if you went morning in
[27:05] now you might be given eternal life for
[27:07] being good at two but in other words
[27:10] it's not his salvation right and that
[27:14] soul of that man can't come back and
[27:16] make me any better but now when Christ
[27:19] died when he pushed us out of the way
[27:21] and took the cross he said I'm dying for
[27:25] your good so when he died he come back
[27:28] to make you better
[27:29] that's why there's only one man could
[27:31] have died that was Jesus Christ he was
[27:33] old man to die give his life and give it
[27:36] freely he John the man can take the soul
[27:38] and imparted back to us that's the whole
[27:39] thing because we have a soul of God if
[27:42] you're born again that's all it was I
[27:44] know
[27:45] in you today good morning meeting
[27:47] another man couldn't do that no other
[27:50] man on earth could do that only God
[27:51] himself but scarcely for a righteous man
[27:53] will one die
[27:54] that's why you see that listen that's
[27:56] why do you see that doctrine we keep
[27:58] harping on the people say Jesus wasn't
[27:59] on River Jordan well the second part of
[28:01] that doctrine is is that when he went to
[28:03] the cross when he was in the Garden of
[28:05] Gethsemane the Holy Ghost came up out of
[28:08] him he's not a man now buddy I'm telling
[28:12] you danger salvation in that that does
[28:15] away with a whole plan of salvation
[28:18] because whoever went and died up there
[28:20] if it was just a regular spiritual man
[28:22] he's laying someone grave dead and his
[28:24] spirit still the her soul till that time
[28:26] but I depend on that being the soul of
[28:28] God because he's the only one can divide
[28:31] he don't what it can divide to give us
[28:34] eternal life so I heat when he was on
[28:37] that cross I was with him and then
[28:39] eternal life them doing that cross when
[28:41] the body couldn't handle the spirit the
[28:43] soul anymore it left the body that and
[28:45] that made the body die that's just when
[28:47] it's just real sin but God commended
[28:50] look God commended commendeth his love
[28:54] and I wrote Jesus in my Bible because
[28:56] God's love is Jesus Christ right but God
[29:00] commendeth his love toward us in that
[29:02] while we were yet sinners Christ died
[29:06] for us much more than now underline that
[29:09] much more than they saying okay that was
[29:11] good but much more much more than being
[29:14] now justified by his blood we shall be
[29:18] saved from wrath through him no judgment
[29:22] I'm telling you the Bible in that when I
[29:23] read the Bible I see that we don't have
[29:25] it on over brother I'm doubtful you
[29:26] don't have to go through judgment but
[29:28] now every other denomination in the
[29:30] world says they have to go through some
[29:33] kind of tribulation some kind of white
[29:35] throne judgment do not do not do not not
[29:38] as a bride all right
[29:41] no one could watch for it for you when
[29:45] we were enemies we were reconciled to
[29:47] God by the death of his son much more
[29:50] being reconciled in other words
[29:54] accepting what he
[29:56] we shall be saved by his wife amen
[30:02] and not only so not a little paulie's
[30:05] not finished and not only so but we also
[30:08] joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[30:12] by whom we have now received the
[30:14] atonement now there was your tone with
[30:17] the shedding of the blood that's the
[30:18] atonement and we perceived that not
[30:21] naturally you pour gallons of blood on
[30:23] you'd still be up soon right but by that
[30:26] blood sacrifice not the blood but the
[30:28] life it within the blood all right let
[30:31] me read a few more this right here look
[30:35] so really in that chapter 5 right there
[30:38] up to verse 11 God is the heart of
[30:41] brother brother Paul God is telling us
[30:44] through brother Paul that were justified
[30:45] by faith
[30:46] we're justified by what Christ did on
[30:48] the cross we just have to attach
[30:49] ourselves to that and then accept what
[30:52] do you know where as by will in verse 12
[30:56] man sin entered into the world I do with
[30:59] that all right by one man sin entered
[31:04] into the world and death by sin so that
[31:09] death passed upon all men for all for
[31:14] that all have sinned I like to put it in
[31:17] there you know and I know up listen we
[31:20] are special group of people just like I
[31:21] told you links tonight there's there's
[31:23] no link in the way from we were
[31:25] especially group of people but we had to
[31:27] come through a cleansing process before
[31:30] we became that kind of person right
[31:32] because we all see it right here I just
[31:35] like to leave it at that we all have
[31:36] sinned and come short of the glory of
[31:37] God Paul said all right now look he's
[31:41] interpolating know watch what's calling
[31:44] him this is his this one
[31:46] he answered pilate's were about who were
[31:49] the entry points were six scriptures
[31:51] he's trying to really explain this so
[31:53] let's read this real quick the only
[31:55] twenty after for good alright work war
[31:58] has gone one man sin entered into the
[32:00] world and death by sin so what it's
[32:04] saying I believe it's not
[32:05] drinking smoking gambling all that stuff
[32:07] right sending them away right
[32:10] so death passed upon all men for that
[32:13] all have sinned and that's the one where
[32:16] Co feel it's send us in puts more people
[32:19] religious people equally with the
[32:21] depraved for a universal effect there
[32:24] must be a universal cause so death
[32:28] reigned from Adam but weights less thing
[32:32] now watch these interpolated I'll have
[32:34] since stopped right thing no Oh Paul's
[32:36] gonna blame he gonna spring what's going
[32:39] on all right before until the law sin
[32:42] within the world but Stan was not
[32:44] imputed but there's no law there's no
[32:47] there's no sin sin is do's and don'ts
[32:51] amazing is it really the bottom line it
[32:53] is when I watch nevertheless Paul
[32:57] nevertheless death reigned from Adam to
[33:00] Moses what because when Moses came into
[33:04] being to lock him into being okay right
[33:08] who is to think one sorry nevertheless
[33:10] death reigned from Adam to Moses even
[33:12] over them that had not sinned after the
[33:15] symbol to dove Adam's transgression who
[33:19] is the figure of him that was to come
[33:21] that who is that Jesus Christ
[33:23] the figure of him to come Jesus Christ
[33:26] is going to take away that transgression
[33:28] that Adam did alright but not as the
[33:31] offence so also is the free gift for if
[33:38] through the offence of one many be dead
[33:42] Adams problem is it's like I said before
[33:44] Adam went out with even and and took her
[33:47] sin upon him but the problem with Adam
[33:49] was out of what capital G OD he was a
[33:55] lesser God but his soul couldn't come
[34:00] back into Eve the saver are two Sam Arta
[34:05] Abel are takane he couldn't did that
[34:08] because well cuz I don't tell my uncle
[34:09] out I'll take em okay
[34:13] Carson you might be God but you're not
[34:16] that God call down to God that's coming
[34:20] I can divide my soul you can't man
[34:24] that's just the way I see it you know
[34:25] you eat Adam got out programs I haven't
[34:28] got out you couldn't get my hand what
[34:29] god gold mouthguard okay good he
[34:33] couldn't save nobody it's mine you can't
[34:35] see these doctrines of Adam state up
[34:37] Adam I haven't been came couldn't save
[34:39] yourself it's over there he couldn't say
[34:42] thee sure you protected her just like
[34:45] Christ protected the bride while we were
[34:46] in Santa Christ protected us mm-hm
[34:49] but not as the offence them every dish
[34:51] mundo so also is the free kill for a
[34:55] friendly offense of one many be dead
[34:57] Adam much more the grace of God and the
[35:01] gift by grace which is by one man Jesus
[35:06] Christ has abounded unto me you put me
[35:11] and they don't you play mini-me and not
[35:16] as it was by one that sins so is
[35:19] together what for the judgment was by
[35:22] one to condemnation member Adam was
[35:25] condemned in his flesh to now died his
[35:30] soul did not his body died so they're
[35:36] one of my condemnation but the free gift
[35:39] is as of many offenses unto
[35:42] justification for EF Bella for if by one
[35:46] man's offense death reigned by one much
[35:50] more they which receive abundance of
[35:53] grace and of the gift of righteousness
[35:55] your reign in life by one Jesus Christ
[35:58] now there's there's the other preface
[36:03] eight he took him that whole time now
[36:05] now watch now let's go back this is what
[36:08] Paul was explaining what he sent us go
[36:10] back to verse
[36:15] verse 12 because he begins interpolating
[36:18] verse 13 14 15 16 17 wherefore as by one
[36:22] man sin entered into the world and death
[36:24] by sin so death passed upon all men for
[36:27] that all have sinned go over to verse 18
[36:32] therefore see if we would have just
[36:35] explained when to write down except by
[36:37] the airport no he explained the whole
[36:38] process there between the intra planning
[36:40] and within the parentheses and forth
[36:43] verses he explained what he's come back
[36:45] to an Isis therefore as by the offence
[36:49] of one judgment came upon all men to
[36:53] condemnation knew was that Adam even so
[36:56] by the righteousness of one the free
[36:58] gift came upon all men unto
[37:02] justification as loud by one who Jesus
[37:05] Christ even only righteous one okay all
[37:07] right let's recap whoof in if we get
[37:09] down to six I think quick for about
[37:12] asked by one man's disobedience that was
[37:15] the whole thing he was disobedient many
[37:19] were made sinners so by the obedience of
[37:23] one shall many be made righteous Jesus
[37:28] Christ
[37:29] moreover the law entered that the
[37:34] offense might abound the law enter so
[37:39] the things would be a judgment but where
[37:44] sin abounded grace did I underline this
[37:48] twice and grace did much more allowed
[37:52] because grace was first a man that as
[37:57] sin have reigned unto death even so my
[38:00] grace ran through righteousness unto
[38:03] eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord
[38:07] now watch let's read verse 1 because
[38:11] remember chapter 6 it's not chapter 6
[38:13] when I'm doing writing right man put
[38:15] that break in there alright what have we
[38:18] just been talking about what are you
[38:19] just saying I watch what shall we say
[38:21] then what shall we say then shall we
[38:25] continue in sin that grace may abound
[38:27] verse 2 not forbid how shall we that are
[38:32] dead to sin living the longer there and
[38:33] now this is the baptismal scripture so
[38:35] we'll cover it next Sunday we read this
[38:37] at the baptismal scripture chapter stick
[38:39] to verse 11 we read this for the baptism
[38:43] because that's what he's talking about
[38:45] death has no more dominion over me you
[38:48] and I when we go into that deadly into
[38:50] that water dad dad what dad just put me
[38:56] in there death burial resurrection all
[38:59] right that's why I always say we don't
[39:01] do a baptism what we go into a killing
[39:06] but we also want a resurrection
[39:08] man so let's go throwing a stick Nick
[39:15] chapter 3
[39:17] [Music]
