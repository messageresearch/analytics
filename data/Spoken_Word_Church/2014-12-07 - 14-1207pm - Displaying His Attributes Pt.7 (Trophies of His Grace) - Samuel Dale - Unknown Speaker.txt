just read verse maybe six and 7even to get back into our thought and hope everybody understood we had a visitor with us this morning and you you don't go into something like this and try to explain something to people that don't know what you're talking about because we're going to talk about the grace of marriage and divorce and and you know it's not far everybody right it can't be that's what everybody thinks it is you know and people want to have it pass it out you know well you can't do that we'll find out it's through the opening of the word as the only way that it can come all right because that's the way it came to the prophet now remember by way of announcement brother Lise will be speaking for us this Wednesday then our Christmas time together next Sunday only one service we'll be eating together and having a good time fellowshipping and then there will be no service on the 24th on that Wednesday because of Christmas watch Night Service on the 31st at 8:00 brother Boran be preaching forest and we will as I said we start 8:00 and then we go a while and then we'll have singing to finish out the night so you know get your songs and get your things ready to to be able to do that all right any other announcements father we thank you for everything Lord And We Praise Your Great Name we know that that name is above every name and we all bow it in honor unto it because we know and realize your name is who you are and what you are and we thank you for that we love you and we just Praise Your Great Name we praise Lord the opportunity to be able to understand just a little bit about you we ask you now to come on the scene with us be with those that are sick Lord and just bless each one be with those that are not here bless and take care of all and every one of us as we all walk in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Zachariah verse six said he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto his removable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of host who art thou oh great Mountain before zeruel thou sh become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone there of with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now you remember zerubabel here would would uh stand in representation and represent the end time you know to where we're at and you know the prince with God but uh you know what we want to talk about is I just want to speak a little bit about it to too uh sister Ceta some of you have heard of this of a vision or dream a little boy had in 1937 about uh seeing California the earthquakes and the thing some of you already have it but if you don't have it there's a copy here you can take it and get somebody to run off some copies all right because that way you know some of you may not have ever uh seen it and all we've we've had it I'm sure I got it in my uh stuff at home but uh you know if you want a copy of it make sure you get one all right but now what I want to do this afternoon is just because that was intentions this morning to come into it and speak about the grace of marriage and divorce all right now first off as I said there would be qualifications or things that would have to take place and that's what I was trying to explain laain this morning and so I just kind of put it into a message form to be able to talk about the grace of God you see God gave us an opportunity he has here in the end time for us to come to a place that I believe somebody is going to come to a change of the body cuz the Bible says it now I believe that see somebody well why can't we believe that we are them all right but it would have to be at a certain thing because you can't just say well just Grace you know that's what it's getting at this morning you know we just say well what do you mean brother it's just Grace you know we believe in the grace of God yeah and what did everybody have their ideas about Grace from you can go do anything you want to and still be saved to anything in the world yeah but that won't turn out to be the true Revelation because I I believe like I was saying this morning my point was God gave a prophet in the beginning when he started dealing with mankind outside of the garden you know in the coming down he gave a prophet all right and a prophet is Grace to the people right that really want it now he's a sign of judgment to those who don't want it all right so he's doing a compound thing see he's speaking it and he's bringing it and and see God gave Moses then to go down to Egypt to free the children of Israel and I'll read you something in a minute from the marriage and divorce that where brother brandham is speaking about it but see that Prophet is a sign of Grace right right but what did we find out this morning we were talking about the prophet is a sign that God the Messiah you know the quote is that the Messiah is going to speak all right John the Baptist stood out there introduced the Messiah amen and he spoke all right now the prophet would have had to waited um some way of explaining what I'm talking about um brother brandom knew a lot of things may I approach it this way uh you can go back to the 64 questions and answers conduct order and Doctrine and you'll find him mentioning because he was questioned pretty highly right during that period of time about you know marriage and divorce all right and you'll find him there saying you know go on now don't don't do anything don't just just run out of here and do this should we do that should we do this he said don't do those things he said go on until you hear from me he says now there's been uh things in the Bible before that was made right paraphrasing it and said you know then just go ahead well when you get to the grace of marriage and divorce then you can go back and read and see that he could he was believing that there'd be a Grace Giver right now I believe he was I believe he had the scriptures CU that's what he said back about 62 somewhere along in there he said he had the scriptures on marriage and divorce he said bust every Church in the country all right see but then by doing that I believe he saw there would be a Grace given all right but see that's what people thinks they they think that well he saw a Grace would be given and he just speak it but you can't do that a prophet cannot come and bring something by presumption and the best you could do of thinking how great he was and how God had used him and that was wonderful but he could still not say anything about the grace of marriage and divorce course other than leave things alone don't try to figure it out you know because he would have been doing it presumptuously because remember the quote I gave this morning that the Messiah was to speak all right a prophet was assigned God was going to speak all right you say well he he knew about it what he knew about a lot of things right he knew a lot of the scriptures that related to a lot of the things but you can't go speak something presumptuously because even though you may have it lined up correctly it may not be time it may not be the right people it may not be according to what God wants to brought out you know so he waited you know and like I told you the other day I remember some of the older ones tell me about it you know that people are just running the country when brother randam mentioned marriage and divorce they would just running the country boy they was telling all about what this was and what that was and everything well he was just going on itself but then one day God spoke to him and when he spoke to him then he came and told us all right because that would put it to where it wouldn't be presumptuous all right now now we'll read this quote after a while that he said that because of the opening of The Seven Seals All right so now he put it into the seals and he tells us that in the Seals All Things was revealed right amen you know everything was revealed in the seals now there was a lot of things that he preached later uh a more depth greater understanding but it was revealed he even said the Rapture was revealed in the seals you know everything was there because because it's a seven seal book of redemption amen all right and he said because of the opening of The Seven Seals so look what he was waiting for and at the time that he was speaking of it in 64 remember 63 the seals had done been broke right but that still didn't give him a right to just go out and speak he had to wait until God told him well you know see then in doing that we may get presumptuously about what we think but yet can we keep it with the word of the Lord you know what about the grace of marriage and divorce what do you think about it right now we know for certain that he said and I had the quotes this morning just giving but he said on a is this a sign of the end he was speaking and he said one of the um how many it was so many of the Mysteries that was there and he said one of them was true Grace straightened out well it evidently must have been all messed up and that was kind of the line I was doing this morning trying to get it to where we wouldn't think that its works or we wouldn't think it was this that it was you know it's always been the grace of God right all right and God gave the lamb you know his grace uh he sent the prophet his grace uh that wasn't all he done he came down himself all right now I believe that this prophet's message is that that zerubabel is speaking of Amen you know or typing in zeruel that Zachariah that it would The Headstone would come crying Grace Grace now I'm not looking for something else to come right you may be uh I'm not looking for another prophet another time or another doings all right cuz you're getting your numbers all messed up for one thing but still in just plain language um I think we need to believe what we've already received and take that and walk therein yes sir all right and see then believe in what he says I can't vary from that right you know amen because if I do I am becoming presumptuous right you know and you got people that come along you know well that brother boy he preached it right down the line he had it all straightened out I I remember years ago brother mod and I were listening to a certain brother and he was preaching right down the line and he done a wonderful job but when he got down to the end of the message he married Israel or God back to Israel you know when he was taking them out and brother Mo looked at me and I looked at him we came out later and said he missed Happ it didn't matter his whole hour and a half was lined up real good but when he finished it he put into words what he was thinking so then basically he was probably wrong the whole thought because he was lining up to that point to talk about it because God will not marry Israel back because she was put away and he will not do that the 44,000 comes back to be Unix uh even the filal Jew Etc they do not come into the bases of being the bride of Christ all right now because they turned that down all right but see we talk about Grace and we see that Grace is a revelation right well that's why I say that you you can't and why brother brandham would say this is for my people only all right see I've had to get on to people here sometime go out and they say well I went and told so and so about the grace of marriage and divorce well they don't even know one God they don't even know anything about the prophet's message how are you going to do it you going to print it in gl's Aline and send it out or you know put it on the internet and let everybody read it and no it's only for the Bride of Jesus Christ all right and I say to truly understand it it is only for the elect out of the elect maybe that's the wrong way to say it but I simply mean by if it is what he said because of the opening of The Seven Seals then I ask you the question how are you going to understand it without the opening of The Seven Seals amen I mean that's a simple question I've always ask because I'm totally simply M simple minded and and I stay simple that way I don't mean we have to understand everything brother randam taught in the seal book I've never never made nothing like that but you get somebody and they just come in the message and you oh you've heard of The Grace no let them sit down and listen a while amen right you might find just save you time a lot of talking because the biggest portion of them is going to get up and run out anyway once you start laying down the things that the prophet has taught right so you save you a lot of trouble so the best thing to do is just leave it alone uh I never talk to people in the message about marriage and divorce until they get settled right in what they're doing because there's no need of it that's right you're confusing yep because you're they're they're trying to get a false hope and what good is a false hope I want something that I can anchor in the word of God and I say for my own self you can think whatever but when I preached in 82 and ' 83 the seals back there during that series that time I could actually see within the the the confines of the message of the opening of the fth seal and I could actually see where a prophet and the grace stood forth and and the things because it began to be revealed to me all right I I believe that through the opening of the word will come to you and I an understanding that by that understanding we can survive in this day Orly live because most of the people are not surviving they're just going to church and being good and and they don't want you to talk about the things of the seals or anything like that they they just want to well let's just keep it simple well simple can become stupid you know because that's what it is you know but see what do you think about Grace I believe as I was stating I believe the prophet understood the Bible don't you amen I believe he had the understanding I'm talking about there before the before the even the uh the grace was given I believe he had to understanding of things that would be given that's right but he couldn't state that until God gave it cuz you're missing the quote that I said this morning a prophet it is a sign that the Messiah is going to speak amen right right now I I hope you understand this statement if you think that brother brandham gave you the grace right you know I think that over because there's no way a prophet can't do it he only spoke of the grace he could only bring to us the understanding of Grace God has to reveal Amen to you and I that's right and I believe that it's revealed to individuals you know and you say well well it's been revealed to me that brother so and so is all right well that's all right I'm not going to argue with you uh I'd rather have a revelation I'm all right right you know uh I'm kind of selfish let brother so and so take care of himself you know let him go dig it out somewhere I'm kind of selfish I come one with myself they used to laugh at me we'd go to Jeffersonville you've heard me i' I'd go down through there and I'd make sure when we got up there we got a book CU I'd go down through there and I'd take the books out of the boxes that the people was passing out cuz when we went we got a book well I've always been a Jacob on that style I guess that you know I won't watch mine all right now if I can help you along on the way that's wonderful I'm like brother Tatum was when first time we went to his house after coming into the message you know and and U he said brother Dale he said in that cabinet is two copies of everything brother bram's we can get up to now he said you you just sit down there and you take you one and leave me one well that was wonderful I got about 80 books you know and then I went back and got every what he had and U the only problem we had I wound up getting one of them he didn't have two of so I had to order him one but my point was that was wonderful to me he was giving me something that help me you know well then why are we not concerned with trying to help people by giving them everything we can to help them you know and all like that and doing the best we can do to teach the message in the Purity that the prophet brought it you know because you know then it would be based upon that of what you and I could receive go remember now it's got to be revealed to you see a lot of people say it was revealed to brother brandham and that's it oh that's wonderful that was brother br that's right but if it ain't revealed to me and you all right and I I'm blunt plain I don't believe brother random can reveal anything to you all right now even brother brandom uses it and said Jesus said my own life didn't reveal that unto thee so then the life of Jesus couldn't reveal it to you that's right it takes God to reveal well the most important thing we need is what what did he say what we needed more than anything else the baptism of the Holy Ghost we need the inside teacher or else we just get mentally what is said but we need the inside teacher all right so then thinking about it and it was trying to to say this morning a little bit see God sent a prophet look what would happen happened had we stayed with the first plan you know for God to send a prophet now there was none of us looking for a prophet to come I've told you my experience you know and I I believe it cuz I just tell it the first time I read the Bible when I was in the Baptist Church about 18 years old and you know and I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior there in the Baptist Church and I set out to read the Bible Well when I read Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 I told my wife I said it looks like there going to be two prophets come well I was just reading the letter or the word well when brother Mo began to talk to me about it you know and he said you don't we supposed to have a prophet I said now us Baptist we don't lay too much on them prophets uh we take a teacher we take an evangelist and you know in in in a pastor but we don't talk about prophets and and and things like that you know and I said now you going to have to put it in the word he said well okay right here it is Malachi 4 well the question to him was I said that's good I didn't tell him that what I had thought about you know and thinking two prophets would come but I said uh now what about this other one right here in Malachi 3 well see I'm glad that I ran into somebody that had enough bases in the word of God to explain the word of God to me instead of you just got to believe it it don't matter what you got to believe it well I want it anchored in this word all right so he said here's Malachi 3 I said yeah but according to our understanding you you got Malachi 3 and Luke 11:17 you got you know we went through the scriptures back and forth cuz I studied the Bible back then and he said well that's right he said that was John the Baptist but said now where's this other one I said well okay you got a point now we talk you know and I told him I said you've seen the dead raised the sick heal the things happened in the ministry but I said I wasn't there you tell me what he taught in the Bible and I'll know know whether or not he was a prophet because of what the Bible says so I thank God I run into the right man was able to do that you know to express not just you got to believe it right you know you got to believe this you got to believe that no he could base it in the word all right see I believe that the whole Bible is God's grace to mankind you know it's even Grace for for the U sinner to be destroyed you thinking with me what if he kept on being burned are you listening what if hell was eternal no the grace of God stops it from being Eternal right and makes it to the basis that it's going to end one day right well you know a it ain't too bad see then I can take anything in the Bible and I can go back and read it and I relate to God's grace you know to where that I can follow it through there and see that there were certain things happen like we talking about this morning RAB the Harlot married to Israeli General right out of there came down to David and right down to what you call the Earthly lineages well you know God has made a way on a lot of things but I still go back to what I'm talking about the prophet knew those things greater than you and I knew them right amen but yet still he couldn't go out there and say it do you realize what thus sayith the Lord is you know it's thousands of times in the Bible do you realize what thus sayith the Lord is that's uh carnally speaking one person telling another person what to say if a Prophet come out and said thus sayith the Lord it wasn't thus sayith Jeremiah he was telling you what God Said that is thus sayth the Lord that's all right and thousands of times it was in the Bible of the thus sayith the Lord right that God was using man and that's what I said this morning and we're quoting what when a prophet speaks was you listening it means God is going to speak all right he said thus sayith the Lord that meant God told him what to say that's why even balam says I cannot say anything contrary to what God has told me but see Jesus never said thus say Lord it was the Lord himself talking all right now we don't make brother random God and I know he would say on marriage and divorce this is thus sayth the Lord or something you know but remember he's standing in the place of God Amen um so close until it's hard to distinguish and I understand why people would make try to make brother Ram God you know and want worship Him and and all like that if you'd been there with him uh to live day by day and everything happen you know and turn around fishing and get him over here he told you all the things you would uh you know you'd think a lot but yet Brother D what are you talking about I'm talking about the the uh things that would be the greatest of all is for us to believe that God can speak to us that doesn't do you any good to think about the grace of marriage and divorce to think about now listen to my word I'm sorry I'm just human uh he had to speak through the prophet but that's going to do no good until he speaks to you right this C the prophet even called maybe your name but just remember what that Prophet said he says there's many William Brams and he says just because the Bible would say William brandham he said I can't go that way he said I'd rather have whosoever will of course in the message they don't like that oh it's not whosoever will we are the seed you know all right SE it on to death but do you believe God has spoken to us now he's spoken to us by way of the Prophet right amen we'll all anchor on that right amen but what do you think about him speaking to you now we got to make sure we do like we did this morning about making sure it's not misunderstood if a voice speaks to you a great shining Angel a great Glory Hallelujah with a holy holy Halos and all of the things and it says something contrary to the Bible we are not supposed to listen to that voice even God himself said I have sent that to try you you know which means he would allow it to happen that's right we see great shining angels we see all of these these things and we say a voice spoke to me you know well okay but if it's not according to the word then what good is it the Bible says speaking what according to the law and the prophets right if it doesn't tally up with the word what good is your Revelation or my Revelation see what brother Dale I think it's so and so okay that's all right if it is but if it ain't what do we got yeah but you don't believe yeah I believe I believe in God speaking to people right I do a lot of people think that God only spoke to the prophet well my Bible's full of a lot of little people that ain't called prophets that God talked to I don't know about yours but you know that God spoke to people so I believe God can speak to people but I believe we can take that and not only misinterpret it but we can you know apply it wrong we can do what we want to with it and we come out with our own ideas right all right God was standing on Earth speaking to mankind that all they done all their life was studi the word of God that's right right and when it wound up did they believe him no well there must be a place a point or something that we can all find to anchor down and believe all right and then we say well well you know just go out and tell the world about the grace doesn't do any good it's not for that's right but now it's only for the one that can be revealed to I believe Grace must be revealed I believe that brother brandham says on uh it's in the church age one of them not in the church age one of the book he said the only way you can be saved is by Revelation I don't believe you're saved because you intellectually can say something and quote something or whatever you talk about you believing right I believe that according to the prophet that it must be revealed to us that we're saved well I just take it by faith all right like I asked you last night a question I asked a simple question to the group last night that we were and it was an odd question but I asked the question I said uh to make sure we're right and don't raise your hand either way cuz you you know but I said how many of you would be willing to get baptized again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well a lot of lives not raise their hand and they would you know and I believe it uh but you'd say well well why would you want to do that could I done be baptized yeah I have too three times father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ and then the River Jordan and Lord Jesus Christ if I went back I'd get another one you know it wouldn't mean that I was doubting what I had right it would just mean I'd go do it again right but see everybody's so set don't tell me I got to get baptized again I didn't tell you you had to I asked you was you certain enough to know where you stand to where that you can stand on what you got and like I told you I have here baptized people again that were baptized but some of them was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yeah but they was baptized under regeneration no if I was baptized under regeneration I would want to get baptized again because my thoughts would been related to Regeneration not related to whether I was right or not but I'm just I'm serious we say but I can't deny the Lord I done been baptized one time I didn't say you had to be I just asked a simple question of the sincerity of your heart would you be willing to go back and get baptized again well then I'll say to you why wouldn't you I've been baptized before now your actions and reactions shows there's something wrong because if your actions and reaction says well okay CU it ain't going to save you anyway but see what I'm getting at is if we believe this Bible to be the word of God why wouldn't our sincerity be to the basis that we want to follow that and believe it and look back in it and just follow it all the way through and see that that never was a Book of Rules it never was anything like that it's always been the revelation of Jesus Christ even in the Old Testament can I quote brother Brandon he said if you read the Bible and don't say see Jesus in the reverse now ain't talking about the Bible of the body is he no he said if you don't see Jesus in every reverse or the Christ he said need to go back and read it again cuz you missed it all right see that way I can believe Hebrews 13:8 and see that he's the same that's right then I can see grace throughout the entire Bible as I said in this zerubabel see it means Prince with God and in doing it see he brings forth y right Christ brings forth these things and see you can put it right over into brother R's Ministry and you can see what was taking place and a man that grew in Grace and knowledge for all of those years until he come to a place that he could say going as you are now that's beyond thus sayith the Lord are you going to listen with me for a minute now we know Moses gave a Grace right we'll read it in the message you know that that Grace that was given to Moses now listen to what I'm saying God didn't have to say thus sayith the Lord to him he spoke it from his own Revelation you don't hear over in Corinthians where Paul is given the grace that he says thus sayith the Lord he says I say that's true so was the prophet dealing with did he had to have you know was he saying well now wait a minute and I know he did that's the way he was even to uh I miss this I get it right I think was sister had it right were he seen that she could not get it as to what he was saying about say anything you know and I'll speak it behind you you know what he stopped and said he said no sister had it right he said that's thus sayith the Lord cuz see he knew she needed something to Anchor it into so he didn't have any problems going back because it was thus sayeth the Lord but Moses didn't have to come out thus sayith the Lord this is right no he gave the grace right he gave the grace that went there all Paul didn't have to come out and say thus sayith the Lord no he gave the grace and brother Brandon spoke it he said I say that was greater than thus sayith the Lord because that was God himself coming through a man's thinking and would that be any different to what uh David could saying they pierced my hands and my feet or whatever when he had entered into the spirit realm so close until he was speaking in the first person but think about it I hope you understand the layout that I'm making that I don't believe that just anybody in this message can understand marriage and divorce you know just coming in and just believing and starting but that's what everybody wants that's why you see such of problems you know but I ask you the question you say brother Dale I've accepted the grace of marriage and divorce well okay now may I quote it this way it's not whether I accept him or not right that's right it's whether he accepts me or not that's a different story mean I can accept him as my savior but has he accepted me see then the new birth is a revelation and like I said a lot of people believe that their marital situation was done Away by the new birth now I do not believe that that I don't believe it because why would the prophet have to give a Grace if it was already done away he would have just told us we were all right by the new birth but that's what people want to shortcut everything we want out we want our ideas and try to take the Bible and make it fit our ideas instead of taking our ideas and putting them aside and taking What God Says you remember what we were there the other week that you know they asked Jesus can a man put away his wife for every cause cuz that's what they were doing they were just you know but that was not using the grace of marriage and divorce just because you say you believe in grace doesn't mean you're right right see they were a people that said well okay forever cause which meant they just for anything they needed well did that make it right another example I don't believe everybody that took a lamb up to an altar and laid it down and said kill that lamb for me I don't believe they were forgiven right I believe there's got to be a little word called sincerity that goes along with that you sincerely went up there believing it then God will forgive you but if you just go upart and just throw it down and say well I'm doing what Moses told me to do that don't make you right I don't believe everybody that says Jesus Jesus is saved that's right the prophet said you can call him Jesus Jesus and worship the devil that's getting pretty rough well see I don't believe you can accept the grace of marriage and divorce if you do not have the new birth so why deal with the grace of trying to tell everybody about how how they can do this or that other why not deal with him about getting born again right right and see by getting born again then you can come to a place that you can receive more but if you're not born again look where you laughed so the prophet said the most important thing in the world is whether we're born again or not right all right but you see there's a there's got to be a layout if you followed me through the prophet didn't just come out in the 50s the 60s and say these things and even after he said he had the scriptures which I believe that he understood they'd be Grace you know because he could see if he see if he had the scriptures he had Moses and and and uh Paul if he had the scriptures about it but yet you can't just come out and say something because that's going beyond the the point that you're supposed to be you're you're you're supposed to be you know waiting on God and see people come to me and say brother there what do you think about this I said wait a minute now I can't do that I don't how see grace is not a blanket that just you know right see the new birth is not just a blanket just anybody oh you believe this message that means you're born again and you believe this message I'll quote brother Bram he said that's ability to read is that what he said about it all right that's right but you see have you ask God to reveal it to you amen well he revealed it to the prophet well okay we got that settled prophet got it we got that settled now what about me and you have you ever asked God to reveal to you that you're saved now you know what I put right there always right I had rather go through life seeking after God and praying for him to give give me these things then to go through life not seeking God CU if one day he says hey you've had it you remember the prophet when the the guy came you know went to different places and everything you know finally come to brother Bram and he said who said you had it all the time right he said when you read that track said it was settled right there well you know what man needed a revelation didn't he but R around didn't condemn him for seeking God why can't we seek God brother Dale do you seek God for the new birth more a m new birth I thought we believed a statue of perfect man that we were to grow in Grace a knowledge I thought that went in the message see I'm trying to get a point about Grace and to think about the marriage and divorce situation I've went through many weeks explaining that there was a lot of people that didn't need the grace of marriage and divorce because it wasn't guilty if you got a scriptural reason for doing things then you're not guilty right the word sets you free that's right but then see there's a lot there that knowingly openly admittingly know that they was wrong in what they done now you're getting to the basis of talking about the grace and remember my point Grace is not for the future don't ask God to forgive you what you plan on doing that kind of gets into Catholicism you don't want to do that is asking God to forgive you what you done now I'll say it this way I believe Grace and you going to argue me right here so go ahead I believe Grace is a one- time thing maybe You' never considered that thought I'm just honest I tell you what I believe at least you can decide what you believe by I don't believe Grace is something that I can use today and then turn around tomorrow and reuse it cuz if You' done that way you'd say well I used it here then I'll go do what I want to and I'll just use it again no no the prophet made it plain amen go on his yard but Heaven Happ you if you do it again why because you're using up your grace now I do not mean that it's a one time of fire on a bases that you've been married three times and it only gets rid of one wife I didn't say that uh got a little more sense but it's a one-time thing to be used well I mean you know I used it and I just go use it again now uh-uh let's don't go into the wrong category okay am my salvation was for one thing to save me I didn't get lost again and have to be saved again is for one time right see then my point is if I can receive the grace of marriage and divorce I needed it you know and can receive it that's wonderful because it was supplied but why would I want to go back and do other things you know I'm as truthful as I can be plain but truthful if I seen right today that uh I had some way in my life we're not all perfect but I'm just saying if I'd have been married before and you know and things then I just walk out of this pullit you think that' bother me no you know if I had a marital problem that made me to where I wasn't supposed to be preaching I have a bit of trouble sitting down I mean that'd be an enjoyment number one I'd be listening to somebody else I wouldn't be having to stay up and get up at 6:00 this morning well you were still sleeping and I was up at 6 trying to get things together you know I could have enjoyed myself right you women you mean it's a problem for you sisters to realize you're not supposed to preach you mean that's a I feel like I'm supposed to be I believe I'm supposed to be preaching and somebody come along and say nope you ain't called you can't tell me I ain't called God called me that's why brother around and told him he said I'm not going to tell that lady that God didn't call her you remember that he said but I'm going to tell you it's not according to the word you know what that meant to me then God didn't call her is that the way you think if it's not according to the word God didn't call her now she heard voices you know you know she heard things talking to her but it wasn't God cuz he can't break his word and that's that's why to me see grace is a one thing of fire if I've got Grace for what's taken care of what that I've done why do I want to be concerned with anything any further let me be happy what I am you know and that way then I can say well thank God I believe in his grac amen amen he set me free what would I be concerned about well he may me free n now then I'll go find me another one and then he'll Set Me Free again yeah M don't work out too good that's right but now I've said to them to say this just a little bit because the other day it just doned on me something because of studying for this long time about these things but it just really doned on me that Grace sent a prophet you know and I've always believed that but I mean it just something begin to open up God sent a prophet that was his grace well now why wouldn't I want to believe what that Prophet said but it's like I told you now you know you you got the people in the message you're always straighten brother ran them out right he was wrong here and he was wrong there and the dates is off here and the dates off there but I've never heard one of them say he was wrong on marriage and divorce have you have you ever heard any preacher in this message say that brother Brown was wrong on marriage and divorce no he's going to hold on to that well how can you hold on to that when you've done throwed away everything else the qualifications for for God to be able to use the man to speak we was listening to him the other night you know remember where he was talking like this he said people say well brother random you know when he's under the anoint something paraphrasing it when he's under the anointing you know he's a prophet but said when he stepped back he said now how carnal could you be he said not realizing that a prophet means a diviner you know a revealer of God's Divine word but this is wrong but this is right well you know what we needed to follow you right because you'd be the one that could straighten brother I'm out well you know where I stand on that so you know but I was thinking about he started with a prophet now I know he he dealt with him with it atonement I know that now because that's a type of Christ right but his first Contact physically which would relate to flesh was through His prophets all right and then we wind up in the end time with God sending a prophet right see then he begins his ways and ends his ways on what he wanted and he began with Moses as I said that had went beyond the point of thus sayeth the Lord go just picking up to there cuz he used Noah he used Enoch he used the prophet for the message of their day but brother brand just kind of brings it over to Moses because of showing because he was a lawgiver he was all kind of type and uh here you come to Moses and Moses is able to write speak the thoughts of almighty God to bring it from from God's thoughts in his mind down to Mankind and I I was thinking about that and I read this and it really just struck on me so brother pull up number 17 let's just read something on marriage and divorce you know and let's just see what brother Bram had to say about something here that to me was really an outstanding thing and it just made everything open up go ahead and roll it on up and if God our creator was questioned the question when he was here on Earth Jesus Christ you remember the pro the Pharisees you know question and when his delivering Prophet came Moses down in Egypt what you to bring out their children of Egypt to put them in the promised land and that just hit me well there was no way for the children of Israel to enter the promised land without the grace of marriage and divorce would no way you don't understand them you following what heus saying when his delivering Prophet came forth Moses down in Egypt to bring the children out of Egypt that's what he come for to put them in the promised land and Jesus says here that Moses seen the people in this condition and he granted them a writing of divorcement because the situation was what it was Moses found such to let him suffer God permitted Moses that Prophet sent to the people to Grant this writing of divorcement to them they couldn't go to the promised land without that all right when Paul came forth with his I say unto thee the people were trying to receive the new birth and maybe they had it right but see he was beginning to speak of something a promised land and he knew that the people needed to be set free cuz what did they have back there in the Corinthians remember that was coming over and all and you remember then you're not just getting to Pentecost you don't go to Pentecost and cut off polygamy Israel went right on with their polygamy they do it today if they wanted to that's their business but like I've gave you the illustration What about Paul he winds up and the guy comes up and he says I want to accept Jesus Christ but I've been married I got all these wives what I do well they couldn't use it in the typ of Christ so something had to be straightened out so Paul said all right I say I say now back to a point that I was trying to make Grace is not for the future it's for the past how can you bring Rahab to harlot into the correct order of understanding you ever thought about that honest opinion I'd like to hear yours I believe Rahab the Harlot and that Israeli General went off and got married neither one of them was much concerned about Grace but then when it come time to go to the promised land in speaking see then they would not have an opportunity maybe to go to Moses because probably he was gone at that time I'm not so set on dates and times I'm just on a point see then when they did they could say Joshua what are we going to do now remember Joshua is greater in type than Moses right because he means Jehovah savior you know what he could tell him he said well let's just turn back here and read what Moses said and said Moses says go on As You Are go there's no need of separating doing this and breaking up brother R made it plain on marriage and divorce he said we don't have time for all these things and to me I'm honest I I believe he would have had to take taken every case individually and that's the reason he didn't have time to straighten it out because it would have took every case individually and there was no way in the world but my point is one thing before Moses could take them into the promised land he had to give them a grace before Paul could in speaking of Salvation he would give a Grace now I believe in the grace of marriage and divorce and I believe MOS when when brother brandham gave that Grace to those that were really true people right I believe God counted it as righteousness right and he could say you know go home with your wife I know the quote above there where he said wives I I read too but he said go on with your wife and raise those children in the admonition of the Lord but said don't do it again cuz see you're using up your grace you know and see people will say to you well brother Dale do you think I'm free you know am I free to get married I said you got to solve that between you and the Lord cuz that's every individual case you say yeah but so and so and so and so and so and so well so and so and so and so can lead to a lot of so and so right and we can maneuver ourselves through those things to try to work out our situations when why would we want to why would we not want to just say well okay Moses gave it Paul gave it and then brother brandham gave it but now here's my point Moses gave a natural right it was natural in the days of Moses but the time Paul comes into position where he's at is going from natural to spiritual right right have you ever noticed brother brandom in speaking of denominationalism and how we were all married to it but he makes an outstanding statement one day and he says God let it die I believe it's invisible union he said God let it die you can't kill it God let it die Paul's coming from a natural that he has to give the natural but he's heading into the spiritual to see what's going to take place well I believe brother ROM gave natural and spiritual that's me now there was natural things that he could speak of but remember we were every one of us whether we like it or not whether we were ever joined a church or not whether we ever went in a church or not we're all born organizational right you may not need the grace of marriage and divorce physically but if that old husband can't die what have we got spiritually brother Mo used to preach and enjoyed it he said are we married to Adam or Christ right you know that was his St statement I remember that message 40 years ago are we married to Adam or Christ see every one of us was born to Adam by our sinful natures and ways all right and being doing that made us all married to organize religion once it come into being because that just spoke of what would come forth yeah my brother Dale I never did have none of them doctrines no we was born that way if you never had any of the doctrines you don't need the new birth but you see before God would allow Moses to take them into the you know over and cross into Canaan which we know Joshua had to do it he had to bring bring of Grace and see I believe the reason that we've been here 40 something years since the prophet has gone is because that we haven't received what we need right first off we won't admit we need it number one biggest problem sir you can say well I'm as little clean as can be you know well and good but what about the organizational isms that's bound us all if God don't let that die then where we at you see what's holding off the Rapture God has provided everything that we have need of he give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost he give us the prophet's message and he's given us plenty of time to study it out but what if that old husband's still alive I like what brother the old brother said one time he had a book marriage and divorce he wrote down on there he said I'd like to ask brother brandom these questions he said one day said a voice spoke to him and said are you going to believe what you wrote on that paper are you going to believe my Prophet you know what I believe God spoke to me I do yep because he put it right back in the word brother Brandon wasn't out of the word but what I love is this see Paul comes along in Corinthians met the same thing in the church and spoke this is I not the Lord that right now we didn't even know that existed until the prophet came right we didn't know Moses gave a Grace until the prophet came we didn't know that Paul gave a Grace until the Prophet came right watch it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted it and watch and God recognized it righteousness now we're back to where we were a while ago uh did everybody that claim to believe in the grace get the grace don't believe so because God couldn't count at righteousness are you with me did everybody that laid the lamb down get forgiven no only for a special people a group of people that could believe it and accept it well then what about coming on down to our Paul had a right when he found his church in that condition watching now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me this far should not God upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hours late the coming of the Lord is at hand we haven't got time to break these things up don't you D try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals and this is a question in God's word now where is there a question in God's word now God was questioned right the Pharisees question it but where's their questioning God's word you get in a different category let them go on in as they are and sin no more it wasn't so from the beginning that's right it wasn't so and will not be at the end but under modern conditions he said I call myself a prophet if you remember the life statement made on marriage and divorce is an outstanding one and the word of the Lord came to the prophet that is the life statement that he made on marriage and divorce but do we believe that that's just for everybody no see Paul Paul spoke of it but do you think that Luther Wesley and him could understand those things no but see to a people that the word has unfolded it can be revealed but it will not take us into the wrong thing right do you believe in grace yes we don't believe in disgrace that's right I believe Grace is the word of God revealed you remember the statement I was looking while ago and couldn't find it exactly on wordy but somebody said to brother brandham later on about marriage and divorce he said you forgave their sins he said something to this degree it was the word the word is what forgives sins that's why Jesus said it because it's in the scriptures said the son of man hath power on Earth to forgive sins why because he was almighty God all right you said well the bride has the power to F he said yes if you come according to the word see the bride's got the power to forgive sins he just comes according to the word that's your Prophet but it's it's not to just set anybody free that you want to set free no but you take them back to the word that's right you come to me and you say well brother D what do you think about me it's not what I think it ain't got nothing to do with it is what God shows you and you tell me well God reveal to me I'm a't going to argue with you but I will ask you is it according to the scriptures if not then I'll just walk away from you saying that's yours I believe in grace but I believe the biggest Grace that we need to to have is the grace to realize that that old husband is dead that old denominational teaching why did he say we were in the problem of marriage and divorce because of misinterpreted theology and why can't we accept it and say well whatever God wants me to do then I'll just tell you that that's no problem but no we spend our time trying to figure it out and try to justify our doings like I told him last night about the man that claimed his wife was baptized by the Lord Jesus in the hospital because he come in she was wet all over you know poured water come in baptized her and the man said himself he said uh said he didn't know where she was going to live or not so he baptized her you know words he didn't have time to take her out and you know you know so you know it's starting off wrong uh you know and God didn't know where she going to live or not but anyhow so I I knew there's something wrong with the situation so I asked him a simple question I said you believe your wife was baptized there in the hospital bed you remember you know and uh he said yep I said well let me just turn this thing around let me come and tell you the story that my wife was in the hospital and my wife said Jesus come in and baptize her I said would you believe my wife was telling the truth he said no I just said so long why because his boss had spoke yeah his wife see he said if it's your wife I wouldn't believe it but my wife in other words he wasn't going to say a word to her cuz he's afraid of her but you know listen folks the grace of marriage and divorce is not a sloppy thing it's a very serious matter and should be prayed a lot about and thought you know and studied a lot about but not to try to find out what brother so and so said about it cuz he going to tell you what he believe but to find out what God Said and then remember God can't speak according to his against his word that's right what is the worst sin of all is misinterpreting God's word right brother Dale do you think that there's a Grace for people I do I do I think God can set things free I do but let's don't make it this some halfhazard thing and then my point is why would we not be happy where we're at instead of trying to figure out some way to get by you know what you know why I told my wife when we got married she knows it many many years years ago I said if I ever die I want you to marry but I said I will never marry again I said because I found my wife why would I want to look for another hi to put with that hi you know let me just be happy with what I am and as far as preaching you'd say well brother Dale would you sit down if somebody proved to you that your marital problem made you where you couldn't do it well exactly I'd want to said I am and would in Daron in no way to go along trying to prove it's okay for me to Mar I to preach or something I wouldn't do that I would just sit down I could quote his name and and all but anyhow he he was with brother brandham and when he he heard about what brother Brown said he used to preach but he quit why because brother Brown said that that wasn't right the way it was his wife had been married before and he just quit well well I can't quit I'm called brother Bram says if I never preach another sermon yes I sit down on a creek bank and enjoy life he said I'm saved but you know what he preached for you and me amen and I'm glad he did he gave his life for you and me and I'm glad he did at least let me honor it let's stand we'll go into the communion I know what this morning in trying to do but I hope you understood the whole thing together of what I was trying to bring out of the grace of marriage and divorce and and bringing it to the basis of you know to speak on Grace Grace now I hope you understand this wording to me Grace is a person it is the person of Jesus Jesus Christ why would I want to go any further than to be what he wants me to be and believe it Paul says for I have received with the Lord that which also I delivered unto you and to Lord Jesus the same night
