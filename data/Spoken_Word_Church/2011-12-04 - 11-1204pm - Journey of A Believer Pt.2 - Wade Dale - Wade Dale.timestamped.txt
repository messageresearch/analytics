[15:24] um good to be in the house with lord
[15:26] again good to have you each and every
[15:27] one of you back
[15:29] and
[15:31] i'm always afraid if i grab that thing
[15:33] i'm going to let it slip
[15:41] i'm always afraid of that um let that
[15:43] thing go and then
[15:45] flop up and scare everybody
[15:47] maybe we'll do that in the middle of
[15:48] service and wake everybody up
[15:52] beware
[15:53] it could happen
[15:55] if you got your bibles turn back to
[15:57] ezekiel and let's uh
[15:59] let's continue i thought i hope you
[16:00] enjoyed this morning
[16:02] it was uh
[16:03] it was a blessing to me uh
[16:05] you know sometimes you get up here and
[16:06] you labor like a label like an old mule
[16:09] and i know the other ministers know what
[16:11] i'm talking about and sometimes you get
[16:13] up here and everything is just a little
[16:14] bit smoother so
[16:16] uh
[16:17] i attribute that to you because you work
[16:19] the gifts i don't you work the gift and
[16:22] and you were doing very well this
[16:24] morning so let's just continue with that
[16:26] thought while we're standing let's go
[16:29] ahead and make our announcements again
[16:31] uh number one announcement um
[16:34] that um
[16:35] that's very important is that when
[16:37] brother dale does get back your kids
[16:40] children
[16:41] and your parents with children
[16:43] should go and personally thank brother
[16:44] dale for the uh
[16:46] for putting forth the the money to put
[16:49] the uh
[16:50] i know brother sterling it was his
[16:52] project which is
[16:54] uh very proud of what he'd done
[16:56] uh worked out very smoothly very well
[16:59] but somebody had to put the money so the
[17:00] church put the money
[17:02] to buy those things to for the children
[17:04] to have
[17:05] have a good time in the lord and and be
[17:07] able to play so just remember to thank
[17:10] brother dale for that
[17:12] and when he gets back and then remember
[17:14] also monica's class
[17:16] and younger is on the red blue and
[17:18] yellow playset i hope we kind of got all
[17:19] that straightened out in between
[17:21] services
[17:22] rachel's class and older on the green
[17:24] and brown play set because of the weight
[17:26] limits on each one
[17:28] kids watch them playing rough and if you
[17:30] want your kids to play together
[17:32] you know
[17:33] we've got one play set so we keep need
[17:35] to keep them separate
[17:37] one play set is a little bit stronger
[17:39] than the other one the problem we had
[17:40] with the older ones is some of the older
[17:43] kids were getting on it and breaking
[17:44] them so
[17:45] that's
[17:46] one of the reasons we decided to brother
[17:49] sterling came uh several months ago and
[17:51] wanted to do a project so that was a
[17:53] suggestion of mine and then it just kind
[17:55] of
[17:56] you know went on after that to get a a
[17:58] more sturdy playset i don't like for the
[18:00] kids to get hurt or or
[18:03] you know the equipment to malfunction so
[18:05] so we got a good set good strong set uh
[18:08] one of the older swings is set
[18:10] still out there and it has baby swings
[18:12] on it for the babies parents need to
[18:13] watch your kids
[18:15] we still have kids going behind storage
[18:16] building and going behind a big white
[18:18] fence just tell them don't go back there
[18:20] all right and remember that
[18:23] the seats in the back that safe for
[18:24] children
[18:25] and
[18:26] parents of the children only needs to be
[18:30] enforced
[18:31] the nursery is for children only with
[18:33] their parents
[18:34] no individual
[18:37] adult child needs to be back there
[18:40] there's no need of it we have too much
[18:41] we got too many kids now not not too
[18:43] many kids but we've got so many kids
[18:45] that little room can get congested and
[18:47] that is a crow rim set aside for
[18:50] children all right if you're sick like i
[18:53] said go downstairs or you can sit in a
[18:55] as a real comfortable recliner if you
[18:57] feel you need to sleep you can go back

[22:28] a new heart also will i give you and a
[22:30] new spirit will i put within you and i
[22:32] will take away the stony heart out of

[22:38] and i will put my spirit within you
[22:41] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[22:43] you shall keep my judgments
[22:45] and do them and then back to romans 8
[22:48] 30.
[22:55] i love this scripture because it's so
[22:57] positive
[23:02] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[23:04] he also called and whom he called them
[23:07] he also justified and whom he justified
[23:10] them he also
[23:12] glorified let's read 31 what shall we do
[23:15] then what shall we then say to these
[23:17] things
[23:18] if god be for us
[23:20] who can be against us you may be seen
[23:22] the lord has blessing to the reading of
[23:23] the word
[23:24] we'll get started again i want to kind
[23:26] of background a little bit
[23:28] and
[23:29] everybody pretty much got the
[23:30] justification down
[23:32] all right
[23:34] the justification part we we kind of um
[23:37] like i said we got some new ones and and
[23:39] i was corrected about this bucket list
[23:42] but you know what the bucket list is
[23:44] something that you're going to do before
[23:45] you kick the bucket i ain't kicking the
[23:49] so bucket
[23:49] making my own bucket lid
[23:51] but i ain't kicking the bucket
[23:53] oh minnie you know what
[23:56] i can say that
[23:59] luther couldn't say that wesley couldn't
[24:01] say that
[24:02] pentecost couldn't say that we can say
[24:03] that in this end time
[24:05] you said well i'm old
[24:07] reactor could take place in a week from
[24:09] now two days from now
[24:11] what's holding up the rapture is there
[24:13] anything left there's nothing left i
[24:14] believe all the uh all the players are
[24:16] on the field i believe 144 000 they're
[24:18] alive and well over there somewhere
[24:21] i believe the two prophets they're alive
[24:22] and well over there somewhere we just
[24:25] got to get out of the way
[24:27] you and i are holding this whole thing
[24:29] up
[24:32] abraham
[24:33] on his journey
[24:35] he held a few things up he went over
[24:37] here remember he went over here and went
[24:38] over here god said i gave you a promised
[24:40] land
[24:43] and you know what's so
[24:44] wonderful read the future home where
[24:47] brother branham talks about the new city
[24:49] i'll just give you this as a little fall
[24:51] the new city remembers going to push up
[24:54] on the mount of olives you know that new
[24:56] city you know brother brown said it's on
[24:58] the exact spot that we're going to talk
[25:00] about today
[25:01] right
[25:02] that's what he said
[25:04] the exact spot that abraham met
[25:07] this man
[25:09] will be the literal spot he says
[25:11] that that new city is going to push up
[25:14] oh man we're going right back to it
[25:17] abraham was looking for a city and it
[25:19] was right under his feet
[25:22] but it was veiled
[25:25] it was veiled
[25:28] skin
[25:30] because melchizedek that jesus christ is
[25:32] the city
[25:34] he's the city
[25:36] he's the one abraham was looking for but
[25:38] abraham was looking for a literal city
[25:39] with no little city's coming down but
[25:41] that literal city is in you today if you
[25:43] have the new birth
[25:45] so we had to get out we had to get all
[25:46] of us together to make that city all
[25:48] right so just want to put that in here
[25:50] and you have to think for a while but
[25:52] being justified
[25:53] we come down through and we see how that
[25:55] he came to bethel
[25:57] how that he
[25:59] uh got called him and he separated
[26:01] himself but he took a lot with him
[26:03] he made a lot of mistakes but
[26:06] finally he come to a place
[26:08] and we ended up here in sanctification
[26:11] which is in chapter
[26:13] let's go back
[26:15] and start there
[26:20] 15.
[26:22] because you met melchizedek
[26:24] gave him bread and wine
[26:26] that was the priest of the most high god
[26:28] that was who that was god
[26:32] made manifest in another form called
[26:33] melchizedek
[26:35] that was not jesus
[26:37] you'll hear me
[26:39] you'll listen to what brother brown says
[26:41] he said that was not jesus
[26:44] it wasn't jesus the flesh
[26:47] see melchizedek couldn't die for your
[26:49] sins
[26:50] even though that's almighty god that
[26:51] took away your sin
[26:53] that wasn't the lamb of god amen that
[26:56] wasn't the sacrifice right
[26:58] your high priest wasn't the sacrifice he
[27:01] made the sacrifice
[27:04] so he was making the sacrifice but the
[27:07] sacrifice hadn't come yet because jesus
[27:10] had to be born like you and i were born
[27:12] because in the garden
[27:14] adam became a full-grown man but when
[27:16] they had children they were little
[27:17] babies
[27:19] so they came through the mama you
[27:20] understand everybody know what i'm
[27:21] talking about so as they came through
[27:23] the womb to pollute it god had to come
[27:25] to the
[27:26] through the womb to cleanse it
[27:29] all right so it couldn't be that just
[27:30] melchizedek just walks up and we're
[27:32] going to read it we're melchizedek steps
[27:34] up
[27:35] sprinkles a little 16 elements
[27:37] of the earth walks in front of abraham
[27:41] but that earth couldn't be the sacrifice
[27:44] it had to be born of a woman
[27:46] because of why genesis 3 15.
[27:49] genesis 3 15 said i'll put empty between
[27:51] thee and now and seed and the woman's
[27:52] seed in other words i'm going to go i
[27:54] got to come to the woman again
[27:56] i got to come to the woman
[27:58] i i wanted to come another way but this
[28:00] is the way i'm coming right i got to
[28:02] come this way because y'all messed up
[28:04] so melchizedek couldn't be
[28:06] jesus you'll hear me read brother around
[28:08] makes quote he said because it wasn't
[28:10] jesus but then he said melchizedek
[28:12] became jesus christ
[28:14] do you see the difference yes
[28:17] that was jesus christ
[28:19] in theophany form as melchizedek but
[28:22] that wasn't jesus that saved your soul
[28:25] because this is what does it right here
[28:28] this this guy had to come and be a
[28:29] sacrifice
[28:31] then the soul that was inside that man
[28:35] did what that's where the eternal life
[28:37] come from he had to die
[28:39] release the life so it could come back
[28:41] into uni right all right melchizedek
[28:43] couldn't do that right everybody
[28:45] understand that
[28:47] but he was prefigured
[28:49] in melchizedek
[28:52] because jesus said before abraham was i
[28:54] am
[28:56] amen in other words if you don't
[28:57] understood abraham you'd understand me
[28:59] you'd understand moses you'd understand
[29:01] me why because he was back there
[29:03] that theophany that was in jesus christ
[29:06] amen
[29:07] now not two different people
[29:10] it's not jesus and in god
[29:12] jesus was almighty god still is almighty
[29:15] god
[29:16] but in morphy brother brother makes that
[29:19] makes that clear he morphed in to
[29:22] melchizedek just like the little boy
[29:24] that that was in the play
[29:27] one boy played five different parts
[29:29] same person
[29:32] same person
[29:34] he just put on one mask come out and
[29:35] played the villain went back put on
[29:37] another mass play that's what god did
[29:40] because remember
[29:41] jesus christ the same
[29:46] yesterday
[29:47] today and forever
[29:50] now you'll hear brother brown say jesus
[29:51] had a beginning and an ending
[29:55] the flesh part he's talking about the
[29:56] earthly journey of jesus
[29:59] i want to get that straight with you
[30:00] because i'm going to read some quotes
[30:01] it's going to really sometimes
[30:03] not going to sound like like jesus say
[30:05] jesus he said jesus had a father
[30:07] and a mother
[30:09] but then you're going to hear brother
[30:10] brown and say jesus never called mary
[30:12] mother
[30:13] he called a woman
[30:15] read who is this melchizedek brother
[30:17] branham
[30:18] partial revelation
[30:20] in his early ministry you could hear him
[30:22] kind of look but when he come to who is
[30:23] this melchizedek he said jesus never
[30:25] called her mother
[30:27] called her woman
[30:28] because he she only she thinks she done
[30:30] she was just an oven
[30:32] an incubator
[30:34] to where the the egg and the germ was
[30:36] put to create that body
[30:39] that wasn't melchizedek but melchizedek
[30:41] was inside there
[30:43] did everybody understand that yes and we
[30:46] had a lot of new ones so we need to
[30:47] really understand
[30:49] when i read these quotes where he says
[30:51] jesus
[30:52] jesus wasn't this wasn't jesus
[30:55] remember he's talking about the flesh
[30:57] it's about the flesh man jesus was not
[30:59] standing in front of abraham
[31:01] because that flesh man jesus was
[31:02] promised to come to a woman
[31:05] john said behold the lamb of god that
[31:07] takes away the sin of the world the lamb
[31:09] which was the what sacrifice right all
[31:12] right
[31:12] because really
[31:14] well we'll get to it i don't know you
[31:16] understand that but when i read these
[31:18] quotes sometimes you click over and say
[31:19] what is he meaning by that you got to
[31:21] remember what i'm talking about with
[31:23] brother branham he's he's telling us
[31:25] that it's not jesus the flesh man wasn't
[31:27] standing in front of abraham
[31:29] but jesus standing over there telling
[31:31] the pharisees before abraham was i am
[31:34] that that was inside that body
[31:37] was standing there
[31:38] almighty god
[31:40] same one to talk to adam
[31:42] same one and talk to him
[31:44] noah same one and talk to moses same one
[31:47] that talked to abraham same one because
[31:50] remember like i said to that this
[31:51] morning
[31:53] brother brown says jesus knew all things
[31:55] because he was word first that's right
[31:58] attribute
[32:00] thought right word
[32:03] flesh
[32:04] and the word was made flesh
[32:07] and dwelt among us now what you and i
[32:09] did we bypassed
[32:11] coming in that word form
[32:14] all right
[32:15] you were nothing you weren't a theophany
[32:17] floating somewhere you were in jesus
[32:19] that's why you got to that's why you
[32:21] look at abraham abraham identified
[32:23] himself with melchizedek you've got to
[32:25] identify yourself with not just that
[32:28] flesh that was standing in front of
[32:29] abraham but the theophany that's right
[32:32] brother brown calls it the theophany
[32:34] of god was standing in front of abraham
[32:38] do you know
[32:40] here's where that we you know our our
[32:42] eyes sometimes
[32:44] sometimes we don't see things in the
[32:45] right order
[32:47] because of the way we were born or the
[32:49] way we were raised
[32:50] but if we understand
[32:53] that what's inside of us was a part of
[32:56] that
[32:59] what was inside of us what's inside of
[33:01] us if you're born again
[33:02] what's standing in front of abraham can
[33:04] we be that blind
[33:07] is it a different
[33:08] god is it a different new birth
[33:12] it's the same theophany
[33:15] that's why folks we can understand the
[33:17] word and other people can't understand
[33:19] it
[33:21] now it wasn't my literal eyes that was
[33:24] standing there but by the eyes of faith
[33:26] and what's inside of me i can see i was
[33:29] there that's right
[33:32] brother said you walked the shores of
[33:34] galilee when jesus walked the shores
[33:36] when jesus went to hell in his theophany
[33:41] you went with him so you don't have to
[33:43] go anymore you already been to hell one
[33:45] time
[33:46] you don't have to go again amen we live
[33:48] in hell
[33:50] but you don't have to go literally
[33:51] because listen jesus literally you
[33:53] laughed but he went to hell with me
[33:55] inside of me
[33:56] that was my representation satan you
[33:59] can't touch this
[34:01] and if i'm a part of that
[34:02] that's right he can't touch me
[34:14] sanctification
[34:16] cleaned and set aside for service is
[34:18] that correct
[34:19] justification is he picks the bottle up
[34:23] the bottle's dirty but he has brought it
[34:25] from one condition to this condition
[34:27] he's going to use it
[34:29] he's not going to pick it up and throw
[34:31] it away he has picked it up for a
[34:33] purpose
[34:34] but it's dirty
[34:36] you don't want to drink anything out of
[34:37] it
[34:38] but now we come to the part of
[34:40] sanctification
[34:41] chapter 15 after these things
[34:44] i forgot to tell you guys we were going
[34:46] to do this again sorry we had to kind of
[34:48] adjust a few things if you forgive me
[34:50] and forgive them
[34:51] i didn't get to where i wanted to get so
[34:53] i marked the spot to stop that and they
[34:56] stopped at a different spot but it was
[34:57] all my fault i didn't i was too
[34:59] long-winded this morning so
[35:01] after these things the word of the lord
[35:03] you may have to read them out of your
[35:04] bible
[35:06] after these things what after these
[35:08] things the word of the lord came unto
[35:10] abram in a vision saying fear not abram
[35:12] now we're in chapter 15 of genesis
[35:14] i am thy shield and thy exceeding
[35:17] great reward
[35:19] and abram said lord god
[35:22] that was jehovah adonai
[35:25] what will thou give me seeing i go
[35:27] childless and the steward of my house is
[35:29] this eleazar of damascus
[35:31] and abram said behold to me thou has
[35:34] given no seed
[35:35] and lo one born in my house is mine and
[35:38] behold the word of the lord
[35:40] came unto him saying this shall not be
[35:43] thine heir but he that shall come forth
[35:45] out of thine own bowels
[35:47] shall be thine and that's where we
[35:48] stopped at
[35:49] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[35:51] look now toward heaven right here
[35:53] and tell the stars
[35:56] as thou be able to number them
[35:58] and he said unto them so shall thy seed
[36:00] be
[36:01] and he believed in the lord and he
[36:03] counted it to him
[36:05] for righteousness
[36:07] he believed
[36:08] in the lord and he counted it to him for
[36:11] righteousness
[36:13] for he said unto him who god said unto
[36:15] abram i am the lord see there's there i
[36:18] am
[36:19] i am the lord that brought thee out of
[36:21] earth the challenge now what's he doing
[36:23] he's reminding abram where he came from
[36:26] all right
[36:27] he said lord god
[36:29] i or the child is to give me this land
[36:32] to inherit it
[36:35] and he said lord god
[36:38] same thing again whereby shall i know
[36:41] that i shall inherit it
[36:44] so god says okay
[36:48] i'm going to show you
[36:50] now let's go through this right here
[36:51] we'll we'll read a few
[36:53] scriptures and then we'll let brother
[36:54] brown
[36:56] tell you what went on and he said unto
[36:58] him take me and heifer of three years
[37:01] and a she go to three years
[37:04] and a ram of three years old and a
[37:06] turtle dove and a young pigeon now all
[37:09] of these
[37:10] listen
[37:11] all of these
[37:13] animals are used in atonement
[37:17] now
[37:18] and one is very specific if you look in
[37:21] numbers 15 27
[37:23] a she-goat was used for an ignorance
[37:25] offering
[37:26] thank god for that
[37:29] we all need some of that
[37:31] but actually in numbers 15-27 shigo is
[37:34] for an ignorance offering
[37:36] and he took unto him all these and
[37:38] divided them in the midst and laid each
[37:40] piece one against another but the birds
[37:43] divided he not and the reason he didn't
[37:44] divide the birds
[37:46] if you'll read brother branham is the i
[37:48] think it was abram's covenant confirmed
[37:51] i can't remember the year
[37:53] he says he left
[37:54] the doves together because of divine
[37:56] healing the other was he pulled apart
[37:58] all right the doves he left together
[38:01] all right so what's that now watch what
[38:03] abram now watch abram it's abram still
[38:06] it's not abraham it's abram
[38:08] and when the fowls came down upon the
[38:10] carcass abram
[38:11] drove them away
[38:13] and when the sun was going down a deep
[38:15] sleep
[38:17] fell upon abram and lo and horror of
[38:19] great darkness fell upon him
[38:22] and he said unto abram no of assurity
[38:24] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[38:26] land that is not theirs
[38:29] and shall serve them and they shall
[38:30] afflict them 400 years now what's he
[38:32] talking about he takes abram all the way
[38:35] back to israel or not back but forward
[38:38] to israel being caught in
[38:41] egypt for 400 years right
[38:43] and also that nation whom they shall
[38:45] serve will i judge which was egypt and
[38:48] afterwards shall they come out with
[38:49] great substance that was who moses
[38:52] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[38:54] peace thou shalt be buried in a good old
[38:56] age
[38:58] but in a fourth generation they shall
[38:59] come hither again for the iniquity of
[39:01] the amorites
[39:02] is not yet full and that's this day
[39:06] remember brother brown was going to
[39:08] israel
[39:09] and the angel of the lord took him to
[39:11] this scripture right here that the nick
[39:13] with the amarax was not yet full
[39:16] which is the gentiles in this day
[39:19] was not yet completed and it came to
[39:21] pass that when the sun went down
[39:24] what was it the evening time
[39:26] and it was dark behold a smoking furnace
[39:29] and a burning lamp that passed between
[39:31] those pieces
[39:33] and the same day the lord made a
[39:34] covenant with abram saying satan unto
[39:37] thy seed have i given this land from the
[39:39] river of egypt unto the great river the
[39:42] river euphrates now let's read
[39:45] if you pull up number three
[39:48] let's read what brother brown said in
[39:50] faith
[39:52] now and when he did abraham then he said
[39:54] when he did that the birds came down and
[39:55] began to light on the sacrifice and
[39:57] abraham drove them away until the sun
[40:00] went down now watch there was three
[40:02] elements a real horror came over abraham
[40:04] of darkness
[40:06] then after that he saw a smoking furnace
[40:08] then after that he saw a lighted lamp
[40:10] and watch what that represented
[40:12] this little lamp went right between each
[40:14] of those sacrifices confirming the
[40:16] covenant
[40:18] to abraham not nothing abraham done
[40:21] but god's covenant grace unconditionally
[40:23] not if you will abraham is what i've
[40:25] done not if you do this if you do that
[40:28] it's what i've already done what he
[40:30] would show in christ showing the
[40:31] sacrifice just a moment i'll get to that
[40:34] first the darkness
[40:36] death
[40:37] every man do i walk through the valley
[40:38] of the shadow of death next a smoking
[40:40] furnace hell wherever sinner belongs but
[40:43] after that comes a little light oh god
[40:45] grace amazing grace
[40:47] lighting up the way making a covenant
[40:48] well you say brother branham i don't see
[40:50] the covenant all right
[40:52] here it is now
[40:55] and then he goes through and he tells
[40:56] about remember how the the chinese man
[40:58] would the chinese people would tear them
[41:02] tear the tokens in two
[41:03] give you one part and you take the other
[41:05] part and they had to match before you
[41:07] could get your get your clothes back
[41:09] well that's what he's talking about but
[41:11] watch what happened in sanctification
[41:13] now going through our journey look what
[41:15] abram has to do
[41:18] what's the sacrifice consist of blood
[41:22] right
[41:23] there's blood
[41:26] right
[41:27] there's death
[41:29] and that constitutes the atonement
[41:33] we know what happened at calvary but
[41:35] this is the pre-figure that he pulled
[41:37] those animals apart
[41:40] and god swore when he went through them
[41:42] in the light and told him he said abram
[41:46] he just told him he said your
[41:48] seed let's read it again
[41:50] right here
[41:52] abram verse 16
[41:55] unto thy seed have i given this land now
[41:57] wait a minute he said i've given this
[41:59] land he said i'm not he didn't say i'm
[42:01] going to give it to you
[42:02] i've given this lamb
[42:05] now see how close how confident god is
[42:08] with abram that he's going to make it
[42:11] but watch abram's confidence in doing
[42:13] all that god tells him to do and then
[42:16] god puts him to sleep and says you're
[42:18] out of the picture
[42:20] i'm the one that does the sanctifying
[42:22] i'm the one that's doing all this you
[42:24] don't have anything to do with it
[42:27] now listen that was still abram
[42:30] that wasn't abraham you'll see brother
[42:32] brown i mean he quoted abraham but it's
[42:34] not it's abram
[42:35] all right
[42:37] now he shows the prophecy of calvary
[42:39] and all the things that you and i
[42:42] must
[42:43] just be let's be honest with each other
[42:45] when we were first started in our
[42:47] christian journey and justification even
[42:49] in in sanctification where where god is
[42:52] is taking that thing called a bottle
[42:55] and cleaning it up washing it out by the
[42:57] water of the word cleaning it up
[43:00] how are we cleansed
[43:02] by the blood
[43:04] right
[43:05] right we're cleansed by the blood of
[43:06] jesus christ remember jesus his body was
[43:09] hung on calvary but his blood hit the
[43:11] earth and sanctified the earth right
[43:12] right noah's day flood justification
[43:15] sanctification when jesus was on the
[43:17] cross and his blood cleansed and what
[43:19] claimed everything that was here on the
[43:21] earth
[43:22] right
[43:23] and the fire baptism comes later on
[43:26] for the earth
[43:27] but watch how abram is doing these
[43:29] things and god's showing him
[43:33] abram is not your sacrifice
[43:37] it's not you
[43:38] it's me
[43:40] i'm the one that's doing it
[43:42] i'm bringing this light but i'm
[43:43] confirming my covenant
[43:46] at sanctification and this is what god
[43:48] did for me he confirmed his covenant
[43:50] with me because
[43:52] he kept talking to me
[43:54] he kept showing me things
[43:56] he kept letting me walk in his word
[44:00] you say let me yeah he kept letting it
[44:02] was my choice
[44:05] but still he kept putting things look
[44:06] what he done look what he told abram to
[44:08] do get this
[44:10] get this
[44:11] get this
[44:13] tear this apart stand in between keep
[44:15] the buzzards off in other words keep the
[44:17] old devils off
[44:19] keep the sacrifice clean
[44:22] and then i'm going to meet you he come
[44:25] down with the light remember brother
[44:26] brown said you said he come down with
[44:27] that light went in between
[44:30] what
[44:31] jesus christ was torn at calvary right
[44:34] that's your that's your type jesus was
[44:36] torn at calvary and we must accept
[44:39] you say i did that in justification well
[44:42] i did too i accepted that the blood
[44:44] cleansed me but really
[44:47] did you really understand it
[44:51] one more time did you really understand
[44:52] it no you really didn't
[44:55] i'll say you really didn't
[44:57] because i really did
[44:59] and i'm not the smartest pencil sharpest
[45:01] pencil in the drawer
[45:03] or the brightest color
[45:07] who said they mean
[45:10] always my brother
[45:13] i'm going back up here now
[45:16] but that's rip but honestly that's my
[45:19] walk
[45:20] that i can see abram
[45:23] in what i was doing
[45:25] that's why i really enjoyed
[45:27] going through 12 13 14 15 16 17 these
[45:30] chapters and gleaning all this out that
[45:33] this real man went through this man was
[45:35] real
[45:37] he was a real man abram was not a
[45:39] you know figment of our imagination
[45:42] and melchizedek wasn't either
[45:46] a lot wasn't either you got to get all
[45:47] the players together lot wasn't either
[45:50] these people were real
[45:52] man a real man got up every morning
[45:55] walked
[45:57] god spoke to him he said
[45:59] okay
[46:01] he said okay
[46:03] i'll do it
[46:04] i'll get the sacrifice give me you know
[46:06] three three of this and three of these
[46:08] and through this
[46:10] what's the same thing with you and i
[46:12] in justification let me tell you
[46:14] something about justification i forgot
[46:15] this morning
[46:16] we're still a little bit
[46:19] ornery
[46:23] some more than others
[46:25] we're just a little joyce oh
[46:28] see we all go to the point because we
[46:30] can relate to this that's okay i don't
[46:31] mind that
[46:33] george you slap him if you want to
[46:35] he needs some sanctification
[46:38] but we can relate to this guy
[46:40] i can relate to what abram what god come
[46:43] down and did to abram
[46:44] and what my journey is and your journey
[46:47] is i can relate to this this real guy
[46:50] but you know in sanctification there's a
[46:52] lot of things you really you just got to
[46:54] be cleaned and set aside for service
[46:56] right so that jar you know what happens
[46:59] it hurts when you get kids where's the
[47:01] kids kids when you get real dirty
[47:06] i know that julie's daughter didn't
[47:08] she's always been clean
[47:11] but
[47:12] if you get dirty
[47:13] what does your parents do
[47:15] they don't take a feather
[47:18] and clean you off right
[47:20] nobody they take
[47:22] soap lava
[47:25] soap
[47:26] and they take the the the hardest rag
[47:29] they can find
[47:30] and what do they do
[47:32] scrub you clean
[47:34] that's what the lord's doing with that
[47:35] bottle
[47:36] that's what the lord's doing with abram
[47:38] he said abram you got some work to do
[47:41] now
[47:42] you got some work to do
[47:44] you got some sacrifices to make
[47:47] you got some things you got to believe
[47:49] in
[47:49] you got to believe in me and that's what
[47:51] happened in sanctification for this old
[47:53] guy now let's turn to
[47:56] are we dead back there
[47:58] hebrews 6
[48:00] and let's read hebrews 6 because see
[48:02] what's paul
[48:04] oh they've done a wonderful job
[48:06] paul
[48:07] is picking up exactly what we're talking
[48:10] about
[48:11] now where did paul get all of his
[48:12] writings
[48:14] from the old testament
[48:15] he took the old testament and it and
[48:18] transposed it into the new testament
[48:23] right
[48:24] he got where'd he get it from he said
[48:25] well he got it from god he read the old
[48:27] testament remember he was a scholar
[48:31] the word had been put in his heart or in
[48:34] his in his physical person and then when
[48:36] god quickened it just like the
[48:38] the people in the uh upper room what
[48:41] quickened in the upper room it quickened
[48:43] all the word that they held for all
[48:45] those three and a half years
[48:47] that's why people
[48:49] even though you'd be sanctified you say
[48:51] well god i'm having so much trouble in
[48:53] god
[48:54] lord help me
[48:56] he's trying
[48:58] just sit here and pack it in
[49:01] pack it in and one day god's promise he
[49:03] promised abram he said abram
[49:07] you notice he didn't give him the land
[49:08] at first
[49:11] but he said i've already gave it to you
[49:12] he said you got a little work to do
[49:14] you got a little journey to go through
[49:16] for when god made promise to abraham
[49:18] because he could swear by no greater he
[49:20] swear by himself
[49:21] saying surely blessing i will bless thee
[49:24] and multiplying i will multiply thee and
[49:27] so after he had patiently endured who
[49:30] abram
[49:31] patiently
[49:33] endured
[49:34] he obtained the promise
[49:38] god told him a long time ago you're
[49:39] gonna have a kid
[49:41] right
[49:42] you have a child you've got to have a
[49:43] child because something's got to start
[49:45] you got to be a father of nations so
[49:47] you're going to have to start having
[49:48] children here
[49:49] right yes
[49:52] so after he endured
[49:55] he got the promise
[49:57] now look
[49:58] abram was still abram
[50:01] but abram has got a new attitude
[50:05] abram has got a new
[50:15] now let's go back
[50:18] to ezekiel
[50:23] let's go to
[50:24] let's go to the interval let's read that
[50:26] when we we read them
[50:28] let's go to the interval quote number
[50:29] four
[50:31] and let's see what brother how brother
[50:32] branham explains
[50:36] for any of you new christians that that
[50:39] that need to really
[50:42] look at the three steps of justification
[50:44] read the future home and read this right
[50:46] here read the interval it's really good
[50:50] 1956. god prophesied through the prophet
[50:53] said i will write my laws in their
[50:54] hearts
[50:55] where i put them in the table of their
[50:56] hearts showing that would be the
[50:58] dwelling place of god in the human heart
[51:01] not the human head but the human heart
[51:03] they manage i will write them in my
[51:05] heart in their heart and they'll keep my
[51:07] statutes and go forth saith the lord god
[51:09] said in another place over in ezekiel i
[51:11] will in that day take out your old
[51:13] fleshly stony heart and i'll give you a
[51:15] new spirit and i'll put my spirit in you
[51:18] now a lot of people
[51:20] even you pentecostal people a lot of
[51:22] times get mistaken on that
[51:24] you get a new spirit that's not god's
[51:26] spirit
[51:32] brother brown said you get a new spirit
[51:33] at sanctification
[51:35] that's why we're at sanctification you
[51:37] get a new spirit that's not god's spirit
[51:40] that's you
[51:41] that isn't god you get a little happy
[51:43] because you got a new spirit and you
[51:44] jump up and down run around over the
[51:46] floor maybe in shout a little bit and
[51:48] speak with tongues i didn't have any of
[51:50] us and run around a little bit
[51:53] and think you've got the holy ghost
[51:54] that's not it
[51:55] that's the new spirit god gives you
[51:58] thank you
[51:59] then after he gives you your spirit then
[52:02] he said i'll put my spirit that's what
[52:04] the matter listen to this have you ever
[52:06] heard this word
[52:08] missed meal cramps
[52:13] what he's talking about is missing the
[52:15] meal the word of god
[52:17] you got in other words you got hunger
[52:18] pains
[52:20] that's what's the matter with the missed
[52:22] meal cramps you got today that's right
[52:24] that's the reason you can't get nowhere
[52:27] with god
[52:29] all right
[52:30] true
[52:32] now
[52:36] the next one
[52:38] keep going continue
[52:40] notice
[52:42] you put a new spirit
[52:44] god has to give you a new spirit
[52:47] or you couldn't even get along with him
[52:51] you can't get along with yourself
[52:54] that old devil spirit you had in you
[52:58] so he's got to put a new spirit in you
[53:00] so you can get along with his spirit
[53:03] amen
[53:04] i will put a new spirit in them and i
[53:06] will put my spirit in them he said after
[53:08] he gives you a new spirit that's you
[53:12] don't get confused with god's spirit
[53:14] it's not
[53:17] it's your new spirit so you can get
[53:18] along with the holy spirit
[53:21] if he ever gives it to you
[53:24] let's read that one more time
[53:27] it's your new spirit so you can get
[53:29] along with the holy spirit if he ever
[53:31] gives it to you
[53:33] pretty strong words huh
[53:35] amen because you and your condition
[53:38] never get along
[53:40] you can't get along with your wife
[53:42] you can't get along with your husband
[53:44] can't get along with your neighbor how
[53:45] are you ever going to get along with god
[53:47] that's right so he has to give you a new
[53:49] spirit for
[53:50] you can get along with him so he puts a
[53:52] new spirit in you and then he puts his
[53:54] spirit in you now his spirit is what the
[53:56] holy spirit gives you a new spirit a new
[53:59] outlook a new faith then he puts his
[54:01] holy spirit in you notice back there in
[54:03] the beginning when that same manner that
[54:05] fell out here on the ground every day
[54:06] the people eat it but notice those
[54:08] people who eat that manna would get
[54:10] hungry before nine o'clock
[54:14] that's the missed meal cramps
[54:18] so he gives you a new spirit
[54:20] that's not the holy spirit
[54:22] so in the type with abram watch what
[54:24] he's got abram abram's got things to do
[54:26] here he's he's even
[54:29] now in verse 16 or chapter 16
[54:33] he goes and says
[54:34] he listens to his wife
[54:39] talking about the handmaid hagar and
[54:41] sarah i said unto abram behold now the
[54:43] lord has restrained me from bearing
[54:46] i pray that go into my maid it may be
[54:48] that i may obtain children by her
[54:50] and abram hearken
[54:52] to the voice of sarah
[54:55] now
[54:56] we're not going to for a length of time
[54:58] not get into that because we got to get
[55:00] to the to the holy ghost
[55:02] but
[55:03] that's what happened through the ages
[55:06] when in a sanctified condition you still
[55:08] make mistakes that's right
[55:11] you know
[55:12] and type abram made a mistake in
[55:14] justification by trying to get his wife
[55:15] away
[55:17] and then sanctification
[55:18] here he is here
[55:20] because remember
[55:22] he didn't have a revelation
[55:24] of who that baby was to come through
[55:28] he'd have revelation or he wouldn't knew
[55:31] it would have been sarah sarah but it's
[55:33] supposed to be sarah right right
[55:36] but now god told him what he was going
[55:38] to do you're going to have a child you
[55:40] have a promised son
[55:41] but he didn't say but see abram
[55:44] if he would have been abraham
[55:47] see
[55:48] he got a revelation that it was sarah
[55:51] but he didn't right
[55:53] so in sanctification we there's a lot of
[55:55] things and sanctification is very very
[55:58] i've always you know what i'm going to
[55:59] say sanctification is very dangerous
[56:01] just like that right there
[56:03] just like that quote
[56:05] brother bryan said if he ever gives it
[56:06] to you at all
[56:08] why because you think in sanctification
[56:10] that you got the baptism of the holy
[56:12] ghost satan says you're done
[56:15] you're sealed in
[56:17] no problem
[56:18] you just do whatever you want to do
[56:20] everything will be fine just you know
[56:22] just
[56:23] you know
[56:24] make a few offerings and a few
[56:25] sacrifices and you'll be okay
[56:28] uh you you're going to church now
[56:30] you you you're communing with with
[56:33] saints
[56:38] be careful
[56:40] be really careful
[56:42] now listen
[56:44] abram is a wonderful type
[56:47] because abram kept going
[56:50] abram did become abraham
[56:53] that's you and i
[56:55] the true believer still go keeps going
[56:57] on now if this would have been
[57:01] this day let's just say this way abram
[57:04] decided to just sit down and relax
[57:08] he took his shoes off in the tent didn't
[57:10] go anywhere else he just took his shoes
[57:12] off just sit down and and relax
[57:15] and
[57:16] and he was happy with his with his wife
[57:19] and and he's happy with his concubine
[57:21] hagar and he's got this child called
[57:23] ishmael
[57:25] dear lord
[57:28] a wild child
[57:31] abraham knew right then that wasn't the
[57:33] promised son
[57:35] amen
[57:36] because god said he would bless this
[57:38] more but ishmael was not the promised
[57:41] son
[57:42] do you understand that that's right
[57:44] sanctification is not your promise
[57:50] the holy ghost is your promise
[57:52] sanctification is not the land
[57:54] it's going to the land
[57:56] the holy ghost is your land
[57:59] that's your possession brother chris
[58:00] that's something you gotta fight for
[58:03] that's something you gotta that's gotta
[58:05] be your one goal brother brown said the
[58:07] holy ghost is the most important thing
[58:11] you could ever do in your life is seek
[58:12] for that holy ghost
[58:15] seek for it
[58:18] like many times when aaron was preaching
[58:19] really enjoy brother aaron's message
[58:21] last wednesday really enjoyed it did a
[58:23] wonderful job
[58:24] and the rest of him did too but a little
[58:26] partial by there i like it
[58:29] he's one of us but um
[58:31] he's on our team
[58:33] but um
[58:35] you know
[58:35] and it's exactly right we got to
[58:37] understand that that's the most
[58:39] important thing
[58:40] get the new birth and then god starts
[58:42] adding things to it now he made abram
[58:44] the promise he's making you a promise
[58:47] you read in the bible that i'm going to
[58:49] do this and i'm going to do that and i'm
[58:51] going to do this
[58:52] but you've got to possess that did he
[58:54] not tell abram go and possess the land
[58:59] well you got it no he said go position
[59:04] you got to get into that land
[59:06] you got to get into that holy spirit
[59:08] to where god can talk to you
[59:11] because you're not a child until then
[59:14] so he gave abram a new attitude
[59:16] because remember brother branham said
[59:19] and i didn't bring the quote that you
[59:21] become a part of a religious order you
[59:24] remember the affair i mean the
[59:26] jesus
[59:27] the uh disciples
[59:30] he said sanctify them through thy truth
[59:32] our word is truth and judas was with
[59:33] them
[59:34] brother brown said judas was sanctified
[59:37] under
[59:38] what jesus said
[59:40] and he was a devil
[59:43] right remember he showed his colors he
[59:44] didn't go on to to pentecost right
[59:48] but he was part of a religious order he
[59:49] even says that your name goes on the
[59:51] book at sanctification
[59:53] now listen god don't sit there and write
[59:55] names and transfer it's just trying to
[59:57] get us to
[59:59] what happens you remember what i've
[1:00:01] always said god doesn't need to know
[1:00:03] what he's doing
[1:00:06] he knows what he's doing he's just
[1:00:08] trying to get us to see what he's doing
[1:00:10] all right
[1:00:11] so that's the part that we see our book
[1:00:13] put on because judas remember jesus said
[1:00:16] he said do not
[1:00:18] glory
[1:00:19] in the healing he said glory that your
[1:00:21] name is written in heaven and judas was
[1:00:23] with him
[1:00:24] so there had to be an explanation there
[1:00:26] was a name written there judas's name
[1:00:28] was written in the book of life
[1:00:30] but it was not written in the lamb's
[1:00:31] book of life
[1:00:34] but you you you start you start look
[1:00:37] look at abram
[1:00:40] able started making sacrifices like this
[1:00:43] several things type in christ
[1:00:45] he was doing things in sanctification
[1:00:47] that he didn't do in justification
[1:00:49] same thing with you and i
[1:00:51] but god is moving him up a little bit at
[1:00:53] a time a little bit at a time same thing
[1:00:55] with you or not and that's what happened
[1:00:58] in your journey please if
[1:01:02] but don't
[1:01:03] stay a part of a religious order that's
[1:01:05] right
[1:01:07] it's okay to become a part of religious
[1:01:08] order
[1:01:10] because all the other disciples were but
[1:01:13] they went on to pentecost and received
[1:01:14] the holy ghost
[1:01:16] and just wasn't a part of a religious
[1:01:18] order anymore
[1:01:19] because you know brother brown said
[1:01:20] that's what the satan will do he'll make
[1:01:22] you feel religious just like that you'll
[1:01:25] get this new spirit and you'll go i must
[1:01:27] be the holy spirit
[1:01:29] but somewhere along the line there's a
[1:01:31] chicken up time
[1:01:33] somewhere along the line you got to meet
[1:01:35] melchizedek again
[1:01:37] like abraham did
[1:01:38] because every son of the faith remember
[1:01:40] will go through this journey just like
[1:01:42] abraham did
[1:01:44] and we got to meet melchizedek
[1:01:46] who god
[1:01:48] in human flesh
[1:01:51] all right
[1:01:52] you become a part of a religious order
[1:01:55] ezekiel says i'll give you a new spirit
[1:01:59] you'll go to church
[1:02:00] now let's go to chapter 16 we see what
[1:02:03] happens there
[1:02:05] that he's still messing up but he's part
[1:02:08] listen
[1:02:11] he brought a birth
[1:02:16] a conception
[1:02:18] it was in the wrong woman with the wrong
[1:02:20] woman right
[1:02:24] brother brown said false
[1:02:26] preachers
[1:02:28] bring false births
[1:02:30] now abram wasn't false
[1:02:32] but there's a lot of people that if they
[1:02:34] stay in that sanctified condition they
[1:02:36] can do a lot of things a lot of damage
[1:02:38] because satan's right in there with that
[1:02:40] new spirit and he's weaving his little
[1:02:42] way in there
[1:02:43] remember he can't get in there when it's
[1:02:45] the holy spirit he can't get in that
[1:02:46] inner court can't get in there holy holy
[1:02:51] can't do it or he'd be your brother but
[1:02:52] boy he can mess around with those other
[1:02:54] ones
[1:02:55] he can mess around with each and every
[1:02:57] one of us
[1:02:58] message preachers
[1:03:04] come on people
[1:03:06] i've always said
[1:03:09] when this thing's over with
[1:03:11] yes
[1:03:13] and you're still here
[1:03:16] i better run for my life
[1:03:19] and daddy better run for his life
[1:03:22] because
[1:03:23] if they don't make it
[1:03:25] if we don't make it
[1:03:26] you don't make it
[1:03:32] your pastor's ordained to what
[1:03:34] leads you through
[1:03:37] okay
[1:03:39] so we're gonna have a lot of mad people
[1:03:40] when this thing's over with i promise
[1:03:43] there'll be a lot of so-called message
[1:03:45] preachers that got a new spirit one day
[1:03:49] that's uh
[1:03:50] gonna have to run for the hill
[1:03:53] but you know what
[1:03:56] abram though never lost sight of the
[1:03:58] promise and that's what you and i got to
[1:03:59] do never lose sight of that promise
[1:04:02] he promised us we'd have a land
[1:04:04] and when he promised us we'd have a land
[1:04:06] then there must be somebody that can get
[1:04:08] us to that land
[1:04:11] just like brother brown said if god told
[1:04:12] that you know told that black man said
[1:04:15] if god told you to go through that wall
[1:04:17] would you go through it he said god said
[1:04:19] it yes he'd have to make a way before i
[1:04:21] got to that wall to get through it if
[1:04:23] that's what he said amen so if that's
[1:04:25] what he said if he said we're going to
[1:04:27] make a change of the body somebody's
[1:04:29] going to have to do it
[1:04:31] like we're talking about you know it's
[1:04:32] not going to be anything natural it's
[1:04:34] going to be something supernatural
[1:04:36] because jesus walked in that world of
[1:04:38] supernatural faith and that's what you
[1:04:40] and i are going to have to walk in but
[1:04:42] abram didn't stay where he was
[1:04:45] he was trying to do
[1:04:48] and that's just like i was telling
[1:04:49] brother mark i think or somebody the
[1:04:50] other day maybe brother donnie brother
[1:04:51] mark we were talking about something i'd
[1:04:53] rather see somebody
[1:04:55] like brother chris
[1:04:57] just i just can't see that
[1:05:00] that water baptism i just what's the
[1:05:02] difference
[1:05:03] what's the difference right well you
[1:05:05] know i just really can't you know
[1:05:07] brother mark people struggle and that to
[1:05:09] me that's fine
[1:05:12] and then see the victory
[1:05:14] on the other side
[1:05:16] instead of seeing somebody come in like
[1:05:18] a house on fire on a windy day and sit
[1:05:20] on the front row and scream hallelujah
[1:05:22] praise god i've never had this this is
[1:05:25] this is the best place i've never heard
[1:05:26] this type of revelation and six months
[1:05:28] later they're gone
[1:05:30] what they got in your spirit
[1:05:32] but they didn't get the holy spirit
[1:05:35] said he got the holy spirit that he
[1:05:36] saved
[1:05:37] not by saying just here i'm not anywhere
[1:05:40] i see it in other churches
[1:05:42] people be on fire one day and you go
[1:05:44] back and preach for them two months
[1:05:45] later and you say well where's brother
[1:05:47] so-and-so oh he's back to smoking
[1:05:51] out in the world you know
[1:05:53] we got preachers like that in the
[1:05:54] message
[1:05:56] two friend preachers of mine
[1:05:58] out in the world having babies they're
[1:06:01] girlfriends
[1:06:02] how can you do that
[1:06:04] you got a new spirit
[1:06:06] but the holy spirit doesn't do that
[1:06:08] but a new spirit will cause you to do
[1:06:10] that
[1:06:12] but you know what they did somewhere
[1:06:14] they stopped in their journey
[1:06:18] that is the difference
[1:06:19] they stopped in their journey
[1:06:22] and they said this is it
[1:06:24] this is it
[1:06:26] no
[1:06:27] this ain't all of it this might be it
[1:06:29] but this ain't all of it
[1:06:32] abram
[1:06:33] goes over
[1:06:35] chapter 17
[1:06:37] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[1:06:40] he was 99 years old
[1:06:46] god meets it
[1:06:49] god makes him at 99 years old
[1:06:54] from 20 from from 75
[1:06:57] to
[1:06:58] 99. abram
[1:07:01] walked through this journey of
[1:07:02] justification
[1:07:04] and sanctification
[1:07:06] just like i'm explaining to you
[1:07:09] so
[1:07:10] if you get it in a day a week a year or
[1:07:14] 20 years what does it matter that's
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:17] what does it matter
[1:07:19] see that's where it comes down to the
[1:07:20] greatest part because you you know you
[1:07:21] you think well gosh they've been here 20
[1:07:23] years
[1:07:25] i still doing what they were doing well
[1:07:28] you know what the light ain't clicked on
[1:07:29] yet
[1:07:30] right
[1:07:31] so don't give up on anybody
[1:07:34] nobody
[1:07:35] right
[1:07:36] we to give up on a lot of people
[1:07:38] people give off on brother dawn
[1:07:40] oh man he's just
[1:07:42] no
[1:07:44] no he just got out of the way a little a
[1:07:47] little bit
[1:07:48] but he made it back
[1:07:50] but listen
[1:07:52] when abram was 99 the lord appeared to
[1:07:54] abram and said unto him i am the all
[1:07:57] mighty god
[1:08:01] and say that in sanctification
[1:08:03] remember back over in sanctification he
[1:08:05] said
[1:08:06] what do you say to him saying after
[1:08:08] these things the lord cometh said i am
[1:08:09] thy shield
[1:08:11] and i exceeding great reward
[1:08:15] now he comes over in chapter 17 and
[1:08:17] we're talking about the new birth
[1:08:19] listen how positive this whole chapter
[1:08:21] is
[1:08:23] and when abram was 90 years old and nine
[1:08:25] the lord appeared to abram and said unto
[1:08:26] him i am the almighty god
[1:08:31] which is translated if you've got a
[1:08:33] scofield bible and brother brown
[1:08:34] verifies it as el shaddai
[1:08:37] which is the breasted god
[1:08:39] in other words abram
[1:08:42] strength was about gone
[1:08:45] he'd done about all god told him to do
[1:08:47] he also went into this hagar and had
[1:08:50] this ishmael and and that went right
[1:08:55] you know and we wander around i'm like
[1:08:56] god what's going on but somewhere god's
[1:08:58] going to meet you
[1:09:01] somewhere god's going to say i am the
[1:09:03] almighty god in other words you've lost
[1:09:05] all your strength that's right you're
[1:09:07] done right
[1:09:09] that's why i like people to run yeah run
[1:09:11] run run run run cause you're gonna get
[1:09:13] tired
[1:09:14] you're gonna get tired you're gonna get
[1:09:16] tired running
[1:09:17] and when you do god's gonna say i'm
[1:09:19] right there
[1:09:20] just lean on me
[1:09:22] i'll give you all the strength you need
[1:09:25] abram was 99 physically the man needed
[1:09:28] some strength
[1:09:31] right
[1:09:32] because listen let's just be honest and
[1:09:33] be adult about this thing abraham abram
[1:09:38] wasn't capable of having a kid at 99
[1:09:40] years old that's right sarah surely
[1:09:42] wasn't at
[1:09:44] 89 years old or wherever she was
[1:09:47] so god in other words god has to get you
[1:09:49] to a place and that's what he did to me
[1:09:50] and that's what he's got to do each one
[1:09:52] of us that don't have any birth and the
[1:09:53] ones that you do know what i'm talking
[1:09:55] about he's going to get you to a place
[1:09:57] where you don't know what to do
[1:10:01] you're done
[1:10:03] god i've tried everything
[1:10:05] i've tried this i've tried that i've
[1:10:07] done this i've made this sacrifice i've
[1:10:09] done this i've done this i've done that
[1:10:11] just like abram
[1:10:13] i mean i'm messing up
[1:10:16] he said okay
[1:10:18] that's all right
[1:10:20] just lean on me
[1:10:22] you know when i forgot first come back
[1:10:24] to the lord i was sitting right over
[1:10:25] here when the church was in the l-shape
[1:10:28] the lord you know
[1:10:30] you've heard my testimony and
[1:10:32] i had began to hurt in my chest and i
[1:10:33] said lord if you take that away then
[1:10:35] i'll go to church
[1:10:37] and i went to church
[1:10:39] on the way to church the devil now i'm
[1:10:41] not kidding
[1:10:42] the devil was so real because he was
[1:10:44] fixing to lose somebody
[1:10:45] he can feel it
[1:10:47] he's very spiritual
[1:10:49] he can feel
[1:10:51] god moving towards you
[1:10:53] and he does too
[1:10:56] he told me the whole time i was coming
[1:10:57] to church daddy didn't know i was coming
[1:10:59] he told me he said you're not good
[1:11:01] enough
[1:11:03] you're not good enough
[1:11:05] you have done all this
[1:11:07] you have done messed up
[1:11:09] you have done and you know i want a
[1:11:10] murderer thief or a liar or anything
[1:11:12] like that i mean i was a liar but i
[1:11:13] wasn't thief i didn't do anything real
[1:11:14] bad i thought
[1:11:17] but that was the worst case you can be
[1:11:19] in
[1:11:20] is to have a little self-righteousness
[1:11:21] but i'm coming to church and i'm not
[1:11:23] kidding you it was just pounding in my
[1:11:24] head you're not good enough turn around
[1:11:27] and go back
[1:11:28] you are not good enough to even go in
[1:11:30] that church
[1:11:32] you know what i finally said
[1:11:35] you're right
[1:11:38] i shut up amen
[1:11:41] i come in and sit down right over there
[1:11:42] about where danny's sitting
[1:11:45] you know what dad preached on that night
[1:11:47] you're not good enough to be saved
[1:11:50] not joking
[1:11:51] not down alive
[1:11:52] he preached on you're not good enough
[1:11:55] to be saved
[1:11:57] and he and it just of course i came to
[1:11:59] the lord but that was my journey i will
[1:12:02] come to the place that i was done
[1:12:06] i was out of options
[1:12:09] abram was out of options
[1:12:12] option one and option two was gone
[1:12:14] option three he was dead right in his
[1:12:17] own flesh you understand what i'm saying
[1:12:19] 99 years old can't perform can't can't
[1:12:21] can't be husband and wife together
[1:12:22] that's what he said he said me
[1:12:24] and she said me have pleasure with my
[1:12:26] lord
[1:12:27] we're going to read this with
[1:12:28] melchizedek we may not get finished
[1:12:29] tonight
[1:12:30] but me have pleasure
[1:12:34] with my lord again but you know what
[1:12:38] that's why abram is the father of our
[1:12:40] faith
[1:12:41] because he kept going
[1:12:43] and he kept plugging
[1:12:45] he kept coming to church
[1:12:47] he kept listening
[1:12:48] he kept reading the bible
[1:12:50] he kept talking about the lord he kept
[1:12:53] doing the right things
[1:12:55] he said oh he did something he did some
[1:12:56] wrong things but he kept moving
[1:12:59] he kept moving he kept going because you
[1:13:02] know what somewhere back in that in that
[1:13:04] back part of abraham abraham's mind
[1:13:08] he said god
[1:13:09] where's that city
[1:13:11] where's that possession
[1:13:14] that you told me i could have
[1:13:16] and it was going to come from me
[1:13:18] he just messed up and
[1:13:20] used hagar but then he gets a revelation
[1:13:23] when he meets melchizedek
[1:13:25] melchizedek says
[1:13:27] sarah
[1:13:29] is the one that you're going to have the
[1:13:30] child with not hagar
[1:13:33] et sarah
[1:13:34] because what did they what did abram
[1:13:36] abraham say he said all that ishmael may
[1:13:38] what may walk before you
[1:13:42] wrong one
[1:13:44] wrong child
[1:13:46] all right let's finish jesus
[1:13:50] i am the almighty god walk before me and
[1:13:52] be thou
[1:13:54] anytime you heard that word in the last
[1:13:56] every month
[1:13:58] and i will make my covenant between me
[1:14:01] and me and will multiply thee
[1:14:03] exceedingly
[1:14:06] and what does it say in genesis 1
[1:14:09] 26 and 27
[1:14:11] to multiply
[1:14:13] and replenish the earth
[1:14:16] that's when you're born again
[1:14:19] that's when the spoken seed word
[1:14:22] multiplies a group of people
[1:14:24] from nothing
[1:14:26] to a group of people
[1:14:29] from look at william branham
[1:14:31] he goes across the curtain of time he
[1:14:33] sees millions of people
[1:14:34] he said
[1:14:35] are these all browns
[1:14:37] he said no these are all your contracts
[1:14:40] come from that one man
[1:14:42] dwight moody brother brown said send a
[1:14:44] million souls to heaven
[1:14:46] that's spiritual multiplication
[1:14:49] but without the new birth
[1:14:51] remember the seed life has to come
[1:14:53] through the body without the new birth
[1:14:55] you won't be there
[1:14:57] and without hearing the word from
[1:14:59] somebody that has it
[1:15:02] i've always said before i i've never
[1:15:05] been to new york city
[1:15:07] but sister johnny i would have
[1:15:09] confidence to get in the car with her
[1:15:11] and go to new york because she's been
[1:15:12] there all right
[1:15:15] well she knows her way around
[1:15:16] i want to get with somebody that knows
[1:15:18] the way around
[1:15:19] i want to get with somebody that's an
[1:15:21] adopted son of god you know why because
[1:15:23] i can power myself after that person
[1:15:25] not be that person
[1:15:27] but pattern myself jesus christ
[1:15:30] abram abraham watch his journey and
[1:15:33] it'll help you i know we're not going to
[1:15:35] get finished okay
[1:15:36] but we'll pick it up maybe some other
[1:15:38] time
[1:15:39] as for me behold verse 4
[1:15:41] my covenant is with thee
[1:15:44] and thou shalt be a father
[1:15:47] of many nations
[1:15:49] neither shall thy name any more be
[1:15:51] called
[1:15:52] abram
[1:15:54] but thy name shall be
[1:15:55] abraham now what does abraham mean means
[1:15:58] a father of a great multitude
[1:16:01] for a father of many nations have i made
[1:16:03] thee
[1:16:04] now look at verse six
[1:16:06] seven
[1:16:07] and eight
[1:16:09] he changed his name to abraham
[1:16:12] but still
[1:16:14] watch god come on the scene
[1:16:18] and i will
[1:16:22] verse 7 and i will
[1:16:24] verse 8 and i will what
[1:16:27] god's covenant is unconditional
[1:16:31] folks he's going to have a bride
[1:16:35] right
[1:16:36] his sole purpose
[1:16:39] is to have a bride
[1:16:40] he's going to have a bride whether you
[1:16:42] want to be one or not
[1:16:44] he's going to have one
[1:16:47] right
[1:16:48] he has made a promise yes
[1:16:50] i will
[1:16:52] i will
[1:16:54] i will make the exceedingly
[1:16:58] fruitful that's right
[1:17:00] what multiple from this earth
[1:17:02] and i will make nations of thee and
[1:17:04] kings shall come out of thee
[1:17:07] and i will establish my covenant between
[1:17:09] me and thee and thy seed after thee and
[1:17:11] their generations for an everlasting
[1:17:14] covenant to be a god unto thee and to
[1:17:17] thy seed after thee and i will give unto
[1:17:19] thee and to thy seed after the land
[1:17:23] wherein thou art a stranger
[1:17:25] all the land of canaan for an
[1:17:26] everlasting
[1:17:28] possession
[1:17:29] and i
[1:17:30] will
[1:17:32] be
[1:17:32] their god
[1:17:34] i will
[1:17:36] i will look at all those i
[1:17:39] wills
[1:17:40] i mean heavens
[1:17:43] look at it i will i will
[1:17:46] i will
[1:17:48] now what does he do
[1:17:50] he comes up to circumcision
[1:17:53] verse 10 let's try to finish this pretty
[1:17:55] quick
[1:17:56] this is my covenant which you shall keep
[1:17:58] between me and you and thy seed after
[1:18:00] the every man child among you shall be
[1:18:02] circumcised
[1:18:04] and you shall circumcise the flesh of
[1:18:06] your foreskin and it shall be a token of
[1:18:08] the covenant with which me and you
[1:18:10] and he that is eight days old shall be
[1:18:12] circumcised among you every man child in
[1:18:14] your generation
[1:18:15] he that is born in the house or bought
[1:18:17] with money of any stranger
[1:18:19] which is not of thy seed
[1:18:21] he that is born in thy house and he that
[1:18:23] is bought without money must need to be
[1:18:25] circumcised and my covenant shall be in
[1:18:27] your flesh
[1:18:28] for an everlasting covenant and the
[1:18:30] uncircumcised man child whose flesh of
[1:18:32] his foreskin is not circumcised that
[1:18:34] soul shall be cut off from his people he
[1:18:37] has broken my covenant
[1:18:39] now god's not finished because he needs
[1:18:41] a bride
[1:18:44] that can conceive
[1:18:46] and god said unto abraham as for sarah
[1:18:48] thy wife
[1:18:49] thou shalt not call her name sarah but
[1:18:52] sarah which is the princess shall her
[1:18:56] name be and i will bless her and give
[1:18:57] thee a son also of her
[1:19:00] and i will bless her
[1:19:03] and she shall be a mother of nations
[1:19:05] kings of people shall be of earth then
[1:19:08] abram fell upon his face and laughed and
[1:19:10] said in his heart shall a child be born
[1:19:12] unto him that isn't 100 years old and
[1:19:14] shall sarah that is 19 years old bear
[1:19:17] now what's abram do old abram spoke up
[1:19:22] old abram spoke up
[1:19:24] and said
[1:19:28] he forgot what god said
[1:19:30] god said i will i will i will i will i
[1:19:33] will and abram said i can't
[1:19:38] god said you didn't hear what i said
[1:19:40] i said i will
[1:19:44] correct and i mean that's what he said
[1:19:45] he said i will
[1:19:47] great then abraham fell on his face and
[1:19:48] laughed and said in his heart shall a
[1:19:50] child be born unto him that is 100 years
[1:19:52] old shall sarah that is 90 years old
[1:19:54] bear and abram said unto god old edition
[1:19:56] one might live before thee see it goes
[1:19:57] back to the ishmael part god says sarah
[1:20:00] thy wife shall bear thee a son
[1:20:03] and thou shalt call his name isaac and i
[1:20:05] will establish my covenant with him for
[1:20:06] an everlasting covenant and with his
[1:20:08] seed after him god had to bring abra i
[1:20:11] had to bring abraham and say look he had
[1:20:12] to grab me by the ears
[1:20:14] he said listen
[1:20:16] ishmael is not part of this
[1:20:19] hagar is not part of this
[1:20:22] your ideas is not part of this
[1:20:25] this is my idea yes
[1:20:28] don't worry about this body thing
[1:20:32] because where do you get a body change
[1:20:33] in there it doesn't say that they kind
[1:20:35] of grew up younger
[1:20:36] all of a sudden
[1:20:39] all of a sudden they meet melchizedek
[1:20:42] and melchizedek tells them what's going
[1:20:43] to happen
[1:20:44] then they take a 300 mile journey
[1:20:47] and then abimelech
[1:20:48] wants to marry this old grandma
[1:20:51] that's 99 years old or 90 years old
[1:20:54] somewhere in there there's a body chain
[1:20:55] you know what i'm saying
[1:20:56] what i'm saying is there's no formula
[1:20:59] to the body change
[1:21:01] there's no
[1:21:02] this no there is to a degree there's a
[1:21:05] formula to go by but there's not a
[1:21:09] in the scripture
[1:21:10] we know what brother brown said brother
[1:21:12] brown said that abraham woke up one
[1:21:15] morning and looked over and said
[1:21:17] i got to bed with the wrong woman
[1:21:20] and sarah wakes up and says whoops
[1:21:23] abraham
[1:21:26] that's what happened that's what he said
[1:21:29] he changed their bodies back so they
[1:21:30] could receive the promised sign
[1:21:32] all right
[1:21:34] we're not going to get finished so i'm
[1:21:35] not going to hurry because and we'll
[1:21:36] just finish up a little bit later on i'm
[1:21:38] sorry i don't want to keep it too long
[1:21:39] all right let's go to
[1:21:44] let's finish reading this because i want
[1:21:46] to get something to you here but my
[1:21:47] covenant verse 21 will i establish with
[1:21:50] isaac which sarah shall bear to thee at
[1:21:51] the set time of the next year
[1:21:54] and he left off talking with him and god
[1:21:56] went up from abraham
[1:21:58] and abraham took ishmael his son and all
[1:22:00] that were born in his house and all that
[1:22:01] were bought with his money and every
[1:22:02] mail among the men of abraham's house
[1:22:04] and circumcised the flesh of their
[1:22:06] foreskin in the self-same day as god had
[1:22:07] said unto him
[1:22:09] and abraham was 90 years old and nine
[1:22:11] when he was circumcised in the flesh of
[1:22:13] his foreskin
[1:22:14] and ishmael and his sons and in other
[1:22:16] words all the other ones
[1:22:18] were doing the same way
[1:22:20] now
[1:22:22] let me just it's kind of
[1:22:24] carnal but look in joshua five
[1:22:28] because this happened again
[1:22:32] but look what happened
[1:22:37] joshua chapter five
[1:22:42] and verse two i know guys i'm going
[1:22:44] backwards on this but i gotta get to a
[1:22:45] point to stop and then we'll just kind
[1:22:47] of maybe go over it
[1:22:48] the next time we speak which will be
[1:22:50] that that will be okay
[1:22:52] look at verse two at that time the lord
[1:22:54] said unto joshua make these sharp knives
[1:22:56] and circumcise again the children of
[1:22:58] israel the second time and joshua made
[1:23:00] in sharp knives and circumcised the
[1:23:01] children of israel at the hill of the
[1:23:03] foreskin and this is the cause why
[1:23:05] joshua did circumcise all the people
[1:23:07] that came out of egypt that were males
[1:23:09] even all the men of war died in the
[1:23:10] wilderness by the way after they came
[1:23:12] out of egypt
[1:23:13] now all the people that came out were
[1:23:14] circumcised but all the people that were
[1:23:16] born in the wilderness by the way they
[1:23:18] came forth from egypt then they had not
[1:23:20] circumcised for the children of israel
[1:23:21] walked 40 years in the wilderness till
[1:23:23] all the people that were men of war
[1:23:25] which came out of egypt were consumed
[1:23:27] because they obeyed not the voice of the
[1:23:28] lord
[1:23:29] and unto whom the lord swear that he
[1:23:31] would not show them the land which the
[1:23:33] lord swear unto their fathers that he
[1:23:35] would give us a land that floweth with
[1:23:36] milk and honey and their children whom
[1:23:38] he raised up in their stead
[1:23:40] them joshua circumcised for they were
[1:23:42] uncircumcised because they had not
[1:23:44] circumcised him by the way
[1:23:46] and it came to pass when they had done
[1:23:48] circumcising all the people that they
[1:23:50] abode in their place in the camp
[1:23:53] till they were whole
[1:23:55] and the lord said this day i've rolled
[1:23:56] away the reproach of egypt from off of
[1:23:59] you
[1:24:00] look what it says in verse 8. they bowed
[1:24:02] in their camp until they were whole
[1:24:06] you get circumcised at 99 years old
[1:24:08] you're gonna walk different
[1:24:13] you get circumcised at 20 years old
[1:24:14] you're gonna walk different
[1:24:17] you understand your walks different
[1:24:19] when you receive the holy ghost that's
[1:24:21] what that there was a confirmation with
[1:24:22] a circumcision right
[1:24:25] which type getting rid of the old flesh
[1:24:27] right
[1:24:28] they walked different
[1:24:30] they had to wait a while till they could
[1:24:31] go in there because remember they were
[1:24:33] going into promised land they were going
[1:24:35] to fight
[1:24:37] they had to wait a little while until
[1:24:38] they got home where they could walk
[1:24:41] but they walked different
[1:24:42] when he said him until they were made
[1:24:44] whole same way with abram
[1:24:46] abram was now abraham abraham now knew
[1:24:49] that god was going to have that child
[1:24:53] or make him have that child through
[1:24:54] sarah
[1:24:57] but that was one other thing they were
[1:24:59] still old
[1:25:01] because when he circumcised he said he
[1:25:03] was 99
[1:25:04] so they had to they had to see something
[1:25:06] they had to meet somebody
[1:25:10] so they met this man
[1:25:12] called melchizedek
[1:25:15] now let's turn back over to
[1:25:17] genesis and we'll finish right here
[1:25:21] because every son of the faith
[1:25:24] has got to take this same journey and
[1:25:26] meet this man melchizedek
[1:25:29] verse chapter 18 verse 1
[1:25:32] and the lord appeared unto him in the
[1:25:34] plains of memory and he sat in the tent
[1:25:36] door in the heat of the day and he
[1:25:37] lifted up his eyes and looked and lo
[1:25:39] three men stood by him and when he saw
[1:25:41] them he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:25:42] door and bowed himself toward the ground
[1:25:46] and said my lord
[1:25:48] if now i have found favor in thy sight
[1:25:50] that's not a way i pray thee
[1:25:52] from thy servant
[1:25:55] then we know understand when he did a
[1:25:56] little foot washing and he made all
[1:25:58] these arrangements
[1:26:00] but you know
[1:26:02] abraham
[1:26:05] had to have a revelation of who that was
[1:26:09] my lord
[1:26:11] translated lord god elohim brother brown
[1:26:13] said
[1:26:16] why
[1:26:17] he met him one time before
[1:26:20] right
[1:26:22] the same man that gave him bread and
[1:26:24] water
[1:26:25] i mean bread and wine
[1:26:27] is the same man he met again
[1:26:30] but he saw three men and said my lord
[1:26:33] one of them was almighty god this one
[1:26:37] but look at what abraham
[1:26:41] come to a revelation that it was a man
[1:26:47] if it was a spirit folks he wouldn't
[1:26:49] have went and killed the cow
[1:26:52] and churned the butter
[1:26:54] and got the milk
[1:26:55] and got the bread
[1:26:57] and fed it to this man
[1:27:00] god had become so real to him brother
[1:27:02] callie till it was a man and he knew who
[1:27:04] that was
[1:27:07] and he knew
[1:27:08] that that man could eat
[1:27:12] what a revelation
[1:27:14] that you and i must come to the
[1:27:15] realization
[1:27:20] that god's going to meet us the same way
[1:27:24] maybe in a former james colley
[1:27:28] donnie farber
[1:27:30] danny fountain
[1:27:33] i thought we were supposed to be priests
[1:27:34] and kings
[1:27:36] right that's right
[1:27:38] we're not taking melchizedek's place
[1:27:41] but if melchizedek if abraham did this
[1:27:44] for melchizedek
[1:27:46] and melchizedek was almighty god in
[1:27:48] human flesh we know that it was not a
[1:27:50] flesh that died for us remember that it
[1:27:52] was not jesus the flesh man
[1:27:55] this was god creating himself a body
[1:27:57] stepping into it and meeting
[1:28:00] meeting abraham
[1:28:02] why did he meet abraham because just
[1:28:04] like brother brown said
[1:28:06] abraham met melchizedek
[1:28:08] and then what did melchizedek do watch
[1:28:10] what melchizedek said let's go over to
[1:28:14] he says where is sarah
[1:28:16] verse nine
[1:28:21] because we know he ate butter and cap
[1:28:23] and all that stuff and they said unto
[1:28:24] him where is sarah wise
[1:28:27] he said behold in the tent he said i
[1:28:29] will certainly return unto thee
[1:28:30] according to the time of life
[1:28:33] now
[1:28:35] sisters at 90 years old you don't have a
[1:28:37] time of life
[1:28:39] you know you have 28 days you know time
[1:28:41] of life
[1:28:44] so what's god doing
[1:28:47] here's god
[1:28:48] verse 10
[1:28:50] i
[1:28:53] not abraham
[1:28:55] not sarah
[1:28:56] i
[1:28:57] see what they say
[1:28:59] brother brown said i was the personal
[1:29:01] pronoun
[1:29:03] the person
[1:29:05] was going to certainly return to the
[1:29:07] according to the time of life and lo
[1:29:08] sarah thy wife she'll have a son
[1:29:11] i said i heard it in the tent door which
[1:29:12] was behind him
[1:29:14] now abraham and sarah were old they were
[1:29:16] old
[1:29:17] they hadn't been changed yet
[1:29:19] they were old and well-stricken in age
[1:29:21] and it ceased to be with sarah after the
[1:29:22] man of women therefore sarah laughed in
[1:29:25] her heart
[1:29:26] saying i am waxed over shall i have
[1:29:27] pleasure
[1:29:29] with my lord
[1:29:30] being old also
[1:29:33] and did that bother god
[1:29:36] did that bother god
[1:29:39] did not go and pitch a fit
[1:29:42] no
[1:29:44] he said in the lord saying to abraham
[1:29:46] wherefore to sarah left shall i but
[1:29:48] surely bear a child which i'm old
[1:29:50] is anything too hard for the lord
[1:29:53] at the time appointed i will return unto
[1:29:56] thee according to the time of life and
[1:29:58] sarah shall have a son
[1:30:00] then sarah denied saying i laughed not
[1:30:02] for she was afraid and he said nay but
[1:30:04] thou didst laugh
[1:30:06] and the men rose up since and looked
[1:30:07] toward sodom and abraham went with them
[1:30:09] to bring
[1:30:10] them on the way
[1:30:11] and the lord said shall i hide from
[1:30:13] abraham
[1:30:15] that thing which i do seeing that
[1:30:16] abraham shall surely become a great and
[1:30:18] mighty nation and all the nations of the
[1:30:21] earth
[1:30:22] shall be blessed in him for i know him
[1:30:24] that he will command his children and
[1:30:27] his household after him
[1:30:29] and they shall keep the way of the lord
[1:30:31] to do justice and judgment that the lord
[1:30:32] may bring upon abraham that's which that
[1:30:35] which he has spoken
[1:30:38] of him
[1:30:39] now we know for surety what happened
[1:30:41] after that
[1:30:43] so we know the other two angels were
[1:30:45] billy graham and oral roberts the
[1:30:47] prophet said that went down to sodom and
[1:30:49] preached to
[1:30:50] the uh denominational world and the
[1:30:53] pentecostal now i had a preacher tell me
[1:30:55] the other day that that he said well
[1:30:57] well if that was melchizedek then
[1:31:00] and and we were talking about what
[1:31:01] melchizedek looked like
[1:31:03] well melchizedek looked like jesus
[1:31:05] christ
[1:31:07] couldn't be no different
[1:31:11] same theophany
[1:31:12] same theophany that was you know that
[1:31:14] was when he resurrected
[1:31:16] uh mary thought he was a gardener
[1:31:18] until he said mary
[1:31:20] when he said mary she said my lord just
[1:31:23] like what he said my lord see so they
[1:31:25] knew see let me tell you something i'm
[1:31:26] trying to get this to you when god is
[1:31:29] god is is not changing he is he is not
[1:31:32] changing in what he is
[1:31:35] if abraham met him that way
[1:31:37] mayor magdalene met him that way you and
[1:31:40] i don't have to meet him that way
[1:31:42] god's not an old man
[1:31:44] god's a young man
[1:31:46] god is still melchizedek
[1:31:48] he's still god of heaven
[1:31:50] he's still your savior your redeemer
[1:31:52] your healer prince of peace mighty god
[1:31:54] but you know what
[1:31:57] he calls abraham his friend
[1:32:00] and i really don't like that song i am a
[1:32:02] friend of god
[1:32:05] cause i'm not
[1:32:07] because
[1:32:09] hey
[1:32:09] god told you this what he said
[1:32:14] when jesus betrayed him what's the first
[1:32:15] thing he said brother gary
[1:32:17] he's his friend
[1:32:21] my son back there in the back he's not
[1:32:22] my friend
[1:32:24] he's my son that's right he comes from
[1:32:26] me
[1:32:27] amen
[1:32:29] we're not a friend of god
[1:32:31] abraham's a friend of god because he
[1:32:32] can't be a son of god
[1:32:37] but you and i
[1:32:39] meet melchizedek
[1:32:41] in the final end
[1:32:43] and we become son of god
[1:32:46] a son and daughter of that man standing
[1:32:48] there he knew abraham
[1:32:51] couldn't produce me in you that's right
[1:32:53] amen other danny couldn't produce me and
[1:32:55] you
[1:32:57] for that he couldn't produce you
[1:33:01] he couldn't
[1:33:02] but he's the father of our faith
[1:33:04] that we believe that what god did for
[1:33:06] abraham brother gary god's going to do
[1:33:09] for us
[1:33:13] but
[1:33:15] not being just a friend that's right man
[1:33:18] sons
[1:33:19] daughters of god
[1:33:22] i don't want to be god's friend
[1:33:24] because judas was his friend
[1:33:27] do you understand is that too dogmatic
[1:33:31] i don't want god at the very end to look
[1:33:33] at me and call me friend that's right
[1:33:37] i want him to say son
[1:33:39] you did a good job
[1:33:41] and what do you think about connecting
[1:33:43] that connects right here that's right
[1:33:46] you'll be a friend to anybody
[1:33:48] you have a dog for a friend
[1:33:50] you understand what i'm saying that
[1:33:52] friendship is friendship
[1:33:54] but family's family
[1:33:56] i'm a part of the family of god
[1:33:59] not a friend but i believe in james that
[1:34:02] we don't have time and james it calls
[1:34:04] him the friend of god and that's okay
[1:34:07] but he can't be a son
[1:34:09] but their bodies were changed
[1:34:12] and then they had the promised son
[1:34:14] now let me read one skip to number seven
[1:34:17] i've got to read this quote right here
[1:34:19] okay
[1:34:20] and skipped a lot but i'm sorry
[1:34:24] two don't go long-winded
[1:34:27] in my old age
[1:34:29] y'all need to get rid of that guy amen
[1:34:31] in the back
[1:34:39] because listen
[1:34:41] the son of god
[1:34:43] was revealed down through seven church
[1:34:45] ages correct
[1:34:48] but to take a body change
[1:34:51] we got to meet a son of man
[1:34:54] that's why son of man ministry had to
[1:34:56] come back
[1:34:57] listen to this
[1:34:58] we would see jesus number seven
[1:35:01] now the levitical priesthood ceased at
[1:35:03] the death of the lord jesus now we live
[1:35:05] in the melchizedek priesthood christ now
[1:35:08] we still are not without a uranthuman
[1:35:10] this is it now the bible see we must
[1:35:12] stay with the scripture and not put our
[1:35:14] own interpretation to it just the way
[1:35:15] it's written no i believe that god will
[1:35:17] judge the world someday by jesus christ
[1:35:19] i believe that i believe that there will
[1:35:21] have to be some standard he'll have to
[1:35:23] judge by because there's so much
[1:35:24] representing christ and so many other
[1:35:26] things he said now let's go to the trial
[1:35:29] this is a really good one
[1:35:31] but now unto the gentiles he reveals
[1:35:33] himself and now the son of god which is
[1:35:34] the holy ghost
[1:35:37] everybody understand that the son of god
[1:35:39] is the holy ghost that's spirit god
[1:35:41] all right
[1:35:43] now jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:35:45] sodom
[1:35:46] i want this blind prosecutor now what
[1:35:48] brother branham's doing let me set the
[1:35:50] stage for it
[1:35:51] when he went to tampa and preached he
[1:35:53] put him he put
[1:35:55] up a trial just like a had a judge jury
[1:35:58] and and witnesses and all that so what
[1:36:01] he's doing now he's talking to the
[1:36:02] prosecutor he's making his case all
[1:36:05] right but now unto the gentiles he
[1:36:07] reveals himself and now the son of god
[1:36:09] which is the holy ghost now jesus said
[1:36:10] as it was in the days of sodom i want
[1:36:12] this blind prosecutor to see this he's a
[1:36:15] blind interpreter of the word always he
[1:36:17] takes his organizational ideas of it and
[1:36:19] knows no more about it than nothing
[1:36:21] he does it to deceive because he's a
[1:36:23] deceiver at the beginning jesus said as
[1:36:25] it was in the days of sodom when the son
[1:36:27] of man is being revealed
[1:36:30] in the days of sodom was the son that
[1:36:32] was god revealed in human flesh
[1:36:34] which was one time called melchizedek
[1:36:37] the father
[1:36:39] now that's not confusing either because
[1:36:40] that's melchizedek that was almighty god
[1:36:42] standing there that wasn't jesus the
[1:36:44] flesh standing there that was almighty
[1:36:45] god
[1:36:47] in human flesh standing in front of
[1:36:48] abraham all right
[1:36:51] melchizedek at that time had no father
[1:36:53] no mother no beginning of days or ending
[1:36:55] of life ever who he was he remains the
[1:36:57] same jesus said father mother but this
[1:37:00] man had neither father nor mother
[1:37:02] and he appeared to abraham in the form
[1:37:05] of a son of man
[1:37:07] which is god in human flesh
[1:37:09] right
[1:37:10] now the son of god was in that son of
[1:37:12] man
[1:37:13] but see the son of god is not going to
[1:37:14] take a rapture i mean a change of the
[1:37:16] body forgive me
[1:37:17] not going to take a change
[1:37:19] abraham and sarah had to meet
[1:37:21] melchizedek
[1:37:22] to get their body changed because that's
[1:37:24] what
[1:37:25] that's what he said i will visit you in
[1:37:28] the time of life i will visit you bride
[1:37:30] in the end time i'm going to visit you
[1:37:32] and according to the time of life all
[1:37:34] right
[1:37:35] because remember we're all feminist in
[1:37:36] the bride right and he appeared to
[1:37:38] abraham in the form of the son of man
[1:37:40] elohim jehovah the church now has served
[1:37:42] the term through the church ages in the
[1:37:44] baptism of the holy ghost but jesus said
[1:37:46] here to make malachi 4 and the rest of
[1:37:48] these scriptures real to you that in the
[1:37:50] last days just before the coming the
[1:37:52] world setting
[1:37:54] setting will be like the sodom and the
[1:37:56] son of man will reveal itself as the son
[1:37:58] of man like he did in the days of sodom
[1:38:01] blind prosecutor can't you see that his
[1:38:03] words are true not nail scars and prints
[1:38:06] and thorns it's the son of god
[1:38:07] impersonated in his church as son of man
[1:38:10] it has to fulfill malachi 4 and the rest
[1:38:12] of the scriptures i call to the court's
[1:38:14] attention look at that real good
[1:38:16] son of man
[1:38:18] that's what melchizedek
[1:38:20] god and human flesh
[1:38:22] met melchizedek
[1:38:24] and then afterwards you see the body
[1:38:26] change
[1:38:28] okay
[1:38:29] he said what's got to do with us
[1:38:31] every son of the faith in the final end
[1:38:34] has to meet melchizedek
[1:38:37] you say
[1:38:38] we got to meet a man in human flesh
[1:38:40] again
[1:38:41] god and human flesh again just like
[1:38:42] abraham did yeah
[1:38:47] what flesh is he gonna reveal his stuff
[1:38:49] in
[1:38:53] can anybody say us
[1:38:56] can anybody
[1:39:00] the whole point
[1:39:02] abraham took a journey as abram
[1:39:05] took a journey
[1:39:06] to meet melchizedek
[1:39:08] he met him one time
[1:39:11] but at the end
[1:39:12] is when the change took place
[1:39:14] we but now look abram had to go from
[1:39:17] abram to abraham
[1:39:19] we had to be called bride remember
[1:39:21] brother brown said now i call you bright
[1:39:24] we had to come to the bride stage
[1:39:26] because the bride is where
[1:39:28] you're going to have the son
[1:39:31] but he's not going to be birthed listen
[1:39:33] to me he's not going to be born in the
[1:39:35] end time as a
[1:39:38] baby he's going to be born four grown
[1:39:41] man
[1:39:45] why mature that's right
[1:39:47] melchizedek wasn't a baby
[1:39:49] he was a full-grown man
[1:39:51] and he told abraham he said i'll visit
[1:39:53] you
[1:39:55] according to the time of life
[1:39:57] and you know what we might have that
[1:39:58] little schniger
[1:39:59] that sarah had but you know what
[1:40:04] it happened anyway
[1:40:07] because god said i will
[1:40:09] i will
[1:40:11] not you
[1:40:12] i will
[1:40:14] and that's why he had to send a prophet
[1:40:15] in the end time to point us back to
[1:40:17] christ
[1:40:18] not that it was anything we could do not
[1:40:21] that is anything that we have done
[1:40:23] but it's christ he pointed us straight
[1:40:25] to that man melchizedek that's why he
[1:40:27] said that that preached to it my that
[1:40:30] priesthood is is eternal
[1:40:33] you say eternal
[1:40:35] let's read one scripture i left it off
[1:40:37] just for a purpose
[1:40:38] let's go to hebrews
[1:40:44] chapter 9.
[1:40:50] i like the word eternal don't you
[1:40:54] i like the word eternal
[1:40:57] verse 11 but christ being
[1:40:59] coming high priest of good things to
[1:41:01] come by a greater and more perfect
[1:41:03] tabernacle
[1:41:04] not made with hands added to say not of
[1:41:06] this building
[1:41:07] neither by the blood of bulls and goats
[1:41:09] i mean goats and calves
[1:41:11] but by his own blood he entered into
[1:41:13] once into the holy place having obtained
[1:41:15] eternal redemption
[1:41:17] for us
[1:41:19] for if the blood of bulls and of goats
[1:41:21] and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[1:41:23] unclean sanctified to the purifying of
[1:41:25] the flesh
[1:41:26] how much more nor is he saying
[1:41:29] i accepted that
[1:41:31] i accepted the bulls and the goats in
[1:41:32] the sprinkler of the heifer
[1:41:34] but how much more shall the blood of
[1:41:36] christ who through the eternal spirit
[1:41:39] offered himself without spot to god
[1:41:41] purge your conscience from dead works to
[1:41:43] serve the living god
[1:41:44] and for this cause he is the mediator of
[1:41:46] the new testament
[1:41:48] that by means of death for the
[1:41:49] redemption of the transgressions that
[1:41:51] were under the first testament
[1:41:54] that they which are called might receive
[1:41:56] the promise
[1:41:57] of an
[1:41:58] eternal inheritance
[1:42:01] for where testimony is there must
[1:42:03] necessity be the death of a testator
[1:42:07] melchizedek couldn't die for our sins
[1:42:10] as great as the man was
[1:42:13] but he had to become jesus christ
[1:42:15] to be born in flesh
[1:42:18] to take away our sin and then he can
[1:42:20] meet us in the end time
[1:42:24] in your flesh
[1:42:26] there's no other way
[1:42:27] we are not going to see i don't know
[1:42:29] what people's looking for but we're not
[1:42:31] going to see jesus christ
[1:42:33] in human fleshly form until we meet him
[1:42:36] in heaven
[1:42:38] we meet him in the air right brothers
[1:42:40] right sisters
[1:42:42] but we got to meet him
[1:42:43] just like abraham did
[1:42:46] how are we going to meet him
[1:42:49] he's he's got to be in our flesh
[1:42:56] there's no other way
[1:42:59] you say well i can't believe brother
[1:43:01] donny you better start believing for
[1:43:03] yourself and forget about him
[1:43:07] because you're not going to make it
[1:43:08] because of him he's not going to make it
[1:43:09] because of you sure we are together we
[1:43:11] are working together but he's got to
[1:43:13] work out his own salvation you got to
[1:43:14] work your own salvation each one of
[1:43:16] them's got to work on our own salvation
[1:43:18] with fear and trembling but let's stand
[1:43:20] listen
[1:43:22] this melchizedek
[1:43:27] is not
[1:43:28] 4 000 years ago
[1:43:30] right
[1:43:31] this melchizedek we're talking about is
[1:43:32] here today that's right
[1:43:35] and he's not just one person anymore
[1:43:38] he's in a member body
[1:43:42] i thought you know i was thinking about
[1:43:44] doing
[1:43:45] a little thought on this man melchizedek
[1:43:47] but this other came up you know and that
[1:43:49] kind of hit on a little bit last week
[1:43:53] but melchizedek
[1:43:56] was not a priesthood
[1:43:58] melchizedek was not some
[1:44:00] spirit some
[1:44:03] spook that met abram no he was a man
[1:44:07] but that man became jesus christ we can
[1:44:09] die for you and i
[1:44:11] see he had all that in his mind
[1:44:14] he knew that when he met abraham that's
[1:44:15] why he called him a friend that's why he
[1:44:18] said you're gonna mess up big boy and
[1:44:20] you're gonna have problems
[1:44:22] but i can't get into you in what i am
[1:44:24] now
[1:44:25] i can't do it
[1:44:27] i bottled up in this theophany that i am
[1:44:29] right here
[1:44:31] everybody understand i'm bottled up in
[1:44:33] this guy i can't get out
[1:44:35] because i made a promise banning genesis
[1:44:37] that i'm going to have to come through
[1:44:38] the womb of a woman and die
[1:44:40] and when i die though
[1:44:43] it's going to break that cell open
[1:44:46] it's going to break that shell
[1:44:48] and then when i do
[1:44:50] i'm going to have a lot of little
[1:44:51] priests and kings
[1:44:53] i'm going to have a lot of little
[1:44:54] melchizedeks running around here i'm
[1:44:56] going to have a little
[1:44:59] almighty god said walk before me and be
[1:45:01] perfect
[1:45:02] the only way we can be perfect is to be
[1:45:04] in him
[1:45:05] let's power him
[1:45:07] dear heavenly father we pray lord that
[1:45:10] you'll come to us lord and
[1:45:13] if if we're not baptized with the holy

[1:46:11] rose of sharon the bright and morning
[1:46:12] star

[1:46:16] that we're all connected with and that's
[1:46:17] jesus christ
[1:46:20] father we pray that you would just bless
[1:46:22] what's been said
[1:46:23] did it not be taken and be void lord but
[1:46:25] it would accomplish
[1:46:27] what is set out to do
[1:46:29] father give us strength in this age
[1:46:30] because you told us
[1:46:32] you told us to draw strength from you
[1:46:34] like abram did

[1:46:38] you've changed our name to the bride of
[1:46:40] jesus christ
[1:46:42] and not going back to any other name but
[1:46:44] you lord
[1:46:46] father i pray that we would each one of
[1:46:49] us
[1:46:50] seek you more lord
[1:46:52] as the day approaches and and the hours
[1:46:54] getting darker
[1:46:57] that's when you met abram
[1:46:59] and changed his name
[1:47:01] you met him in his darkest time when it
[1:47:03] didn't look like he was anything lord
[1:47:05] but you'd already made him a promise he
[1:47:08] promised that through him and his wife
[1:47:10] they were going to have a promised son
[1:47:12] and isaac came through that
[1:47:14] to that meeting lord
[1:47:16] you change their bodies back in a
[1:47:18] pre-figure of what you're going to do to
[1:47:20] us lord
[1:47:21] you're going to change our bodies in a
[1:47:23] moment in the twinkling of an eye lord
[1:47:25] but father let us know that that son of
[1:47:27] man is living and alive and well in the
[1:47:29] bride
[1:47:31] not just the son of god revelation but
[1:47:33] the son of man revelation that we are
[1:47:35] truly god made manifest in in another
[1:47:37] form
[1:47:38] called a bride
[1:47:40] and it's our human flesh lord
[1:47:42] even reading the other day didn't bring
[1:47:44] the quote but lord you said that our our
[1:47:46] flesh even has to be born again
[1:47:49] lord we pray that you'd just be with us
[1:47:51] you promised this
[1:47:53] you said i will
[1:47:55] and you said you were the great i am
[1:47:58] and father being the great i am your
[1:47:59] ever present lord for anything that we
[1:48:01] need
[1:48:02] father being he needs here lord i pray
[1:48:04] that you take care of him
[1:48:06] bring back the old shell lord that maybe
[1:48:08] come over some of our eyes lord and may
[1:48:10] we see you and you may we worship you
[1:48:12] lord adore and magnify you
[1:48:15] because it's your great name that we're
[1:48:17] that we're living under
[1:48:19] not any other name except in the lovely
[1:48:21] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:48:23] bless each one father as we sing and
[1:48:25] worship you
[1:48:26] may your spirit come among us in jesus
[1:48:28] name amen let's sing a song 249
[1:48:38] amen do you have a need
[1:48:58] i
[1:49:09] oh
[1:49:17] is
[1:49:37] i am
[1:50:05] i pray
[1:50:12] you're here
[1:50:32] i am
[1:50:42] oh
[1:51:31] is
[1:51:59] i am
[1:52:26] oh
[1:52:39] i am
[1:52:48] oh
[1:53:24] oh
[1:53:38] well
[1:53:46] but that you know what that gives you a
[1:53:48] peace
[1:53:49] is well with your soul
[1:53:51] you can have strife and trouble and all
[1:53:53] these things but you know what when it's
[1:53:54] well with your soul
[1:53:57] all these other things just kind of shed
[1:53:58] off
[1:53:59] abraham did not sit in that tent and go
[1:54:02] well now i'm 99
[1:54:04] my wife's 90
[1:54:06] this you know circumstances
[1:54:10] he could have sat there and give him a
[1:54:12] hundred circumstances
[1:54:15] but the reason abraham is the father of
[1:54:17] our faith he just said okay
[1:54:20] i'll accept that
[1:54:23] that's no different
[1:54:25] that's why he's the father of our faith
[1:54:28] what did paul say about him we didn't
[1:54:29] get to it but paul goes over there and
[1:54:31] says he was strong in faith
[1:54:34] we see all the things he went through
[1:54:35] but
[1:54:37] the journey was nothing to abraham
[1:54:40] that's right
[1:54:41] god said it
[1:54:43] he made the promise
[1:54:45] and abraham abram walked to abram and
[1:54:47] abe abram abram walked to abraham
[1:54:50] abraham went to melchizedek and when
[1:54:52] they got together
[1:54:53] promise came
[1:54:56] abram didn't stop and start thinking
[1:54:58] about this and then the other oh sure
[1:55:00] yeah he laughed but you know what paul
[1:55:01] said paul said he was strong in faith
[1:55:03] right never wavered
[1:55:06] why
[1:55:08] he got the promise
[1:55:10] folks let me tell you something like me
[1:55:11] brother mark we're talking about when we
[1:55:13] get when this thing's finished and over
[1:55:16] god's gonna give us the prophet said
[1:55:18] verbatim he said god is going to give us
[1:55:20] 30 to 40 days he knew we would be
[1:55:23] looking for who made it
[1:55:26] and who did it
[1:55:28] so we're going to be resurrected changed
[1:55:31] and be around here for 30 40 days god is
[1:55:33] so gracious brother branham said god's
[1:55:35] going to let us
[1:55:37] see who made it and who didn't nothing's
[1:55:40] going to bother us
[1:55:42] are you putting that a bomb in your
[1:55:43] pocket and it's not going to bother you
[1:55:46] you're immortal but god's gonna give us
[1:55:48] time to say
[1:55:50] oh
[1:55:51] but you're mad
[1:55:53] sister regina made it right
[1:55:57] you remember the old story you know they
[1:55:58] told a joke about the guy that says you
[1:56:00] know well i wonder why the how this one
[1:56:01] made it and this made it and he asked
[1:56:03] the angel he said what are they talking
[1:56:04] about over there he said well they're
[1:56:06] over there wondering how you made it
[1:56:11] abraham believe god
[1:56:14] and it was imputed to him
[1:56:17] for righteousness
[1:56:19] regardless of what happened
[1:56:21] regardless of what happened in his life
[1:56:23] it was imputed to him for righteousness
[1:56:25] we're going to have a wonderful time
[1:56:26] brother brown said this is going to be
[1:56:28] the quietest we'll ever be because i
[1:56:30] promise brother gary it's like a birth
[1:56:32] it's a hard laborous thing
[1:56:35] but once it's over
[1:56:37] once it's over
[1:56:39] i mean i looked at that picture brother
[1:56:40] don back there they got a picture we're
[1:56:41] going to put downstairs we'll never see
[1:56:43] that old man anymore
[1:56:46] he's done
[1:56:48] we'll never see we'll never see tom
[1:56:49] farbush walking around with a cane
[1:56:51] anything
[1:56:54] he'll be out skipping the rest of us
[1:56:57] but we'll never see that see so what's
[1:56:59] real
[1:57:00] is this real
[1:57:01] real
[1:57:02] or is that real
[1:57:05] that's eternal
[1:57:06] this is temporal
[1:57:08] that's eternal
[1:57:10] they're just sleeping they're just going
[1:57:11] to be asleep for a little while
[1:57:13] not a problem
[1:57:15] they're rejoicing they're waiting
[1:57:17] for me and you
[1:57:19] to get on our journey
[1:57:23] move forward
[1:57:24] from this day forward until satan i'm
[1:57:27] moving forward amen i'm going forward
[1:57:29] regardless of what you bring
[1:57:31] i'm going forward right now
[1:57:33] i am going to make it
[1:57:36] because god said somebody was going to
[1:57:38] make it and i bet somebody yeah that's
[1:57:40] right
[1:57:41] you love the lord
[1:57:42] put some people on your heart get your
[1:57:44] bucket list out and write them down
[1:57:46] somewhere write them on your
[1:57:47] refrigerator
[1:57:48] and pray for them right
[1:57:51] you know i've got family members
[1:57:53] you've got family members
[1:57:56] what it what what's stopping us to
[1:57:58] believe
[1:58:00] believe for him
[1:58:01] right
[1:58:02] job believed for his kids
[1:58:04] and made sacrifices for him
[1:58:07] but you and i god don't want us to go
[1:58:08] out and make sacrifices he wants to
[1:58:09] believe and like sister steven said she
[1:58:11] wanted to live a life in front of her
[1:58:13] family
[1:58:14] so that brother don and her would live
[1:58:16] in front of their family so that their
[1:58:17] family would be so hungry that's right
[1:58:20] that they would want what they got
[1:58:22] that's right
[1:58:23] they would want what they got and that's
[1:58:24] what i did let me tell you something let
[1:58:26] me give you just a second testimony i
[1:58:27] wanted what my daddy had right
[1:58:30] i didn't want to be my daddy
[1:58:32] but i wanted what he had right because
[1:58:34] he had eternal life he had one out the
[1:58:36] way i wanted to act was the way he was
[1:58:37] acting right
[1:58:39] now if he was a gruff old man and cursed
[1:58:40] and run around and drink and smoke and
[1:58:42] done all that did you want it would you
[1:58:43] want him
[1:58:45] no
[1:58:46] there's got to be an example and then
[1:58:48] when i come to church you got brother
[1:58:50] tom
[1:58:52] he beat you to death
[1:58:54] brother dean
[1:58:56] brethren
[1:58:57] that was around me
[1:58:59] brother colley that had been steadfast

[1:59:23] be something to this
[1:59:25] it must be real to them
[1:59:28] you know it must be real to him
[1:59:30] because i see him moving
[1:59:32] i see him working still in in working
[1:59:34] for god and doing the things of god well
[1:59:36] you know what we need examples
[1:59:39] we need examples find you an example

[1:59:44] difference in imitating somebody
[1:59:46] don't imitate i don't want to imitate
[1:59:48] somebody
[1:59:49] but you know what if they act like god i
[1:59:51] don't mind imitating them
