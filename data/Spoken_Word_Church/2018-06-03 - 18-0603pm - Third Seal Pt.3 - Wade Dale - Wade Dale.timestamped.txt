[16:49] were downstairs and and like father like
[16:53] son I got a I found a frog this week
[16:56] mm-hmm and he settled in my throat so
[16:59] just pray for my voice but downstairs
[17:02] worth you know speaking about the book
[17:03] of Romans and you just see it fit right
[17:07] into the seals and you really I never
[17:09] really saw that before but you see it
[17:10] now that that if brother Brian said once
[17:13] seal could tie the entire Bible together
[17:16] you know - Pete some people that's a
[17:18] far-off thing
[17:20] I mean without an understanding you
[17:22] can't see that without an understanding
[17:26] you would call him a liar but it's not
[17:28] it's just truth because you look through
[17:31] the same eyes as the guy that wrote it
[17:33] if you see this through the same eyes of
[17:35] the guy that wrote it then guess what
[17:37] you'll be able to understand so
[17:39] revelation 6 verse 5 and we'll pray
[17:42] before we get started remember all these
[17:44] that are traveling I just talked brother
[17:45] Joe he's still in well he was in Texas a
[17:49] few hours ago he had had a flat tire
[17:51] last night he had to wait till this
[17:52] morning to fix it so he's running a
[17:55] little behind schedule but they're
[17:57] getting to New Mexico this afternoon
[17:58] late and gonna be there for a couple of
[18:00] weeks for for the meeting that we were
[18:02] gonna go to and then about a week later
[18:04] he's gonna stay again so remember
[18:07] brother Luis he's coming back on Tuesday
[18:08] or heading back home Tuesday keep sister
[18:11] Cristina in your prayer
[18:12] don't you be this lost parents you know
[18:15] what she's going through I have not yet
[18:18] so I don't know what she's going through
[18:19] you just have to pray for I just prayed
[18:21] the other day I said look God you knew
[18:22] it you knew how she would react and you
[18:25] know what to do to fix it so that's all
[18:27] I have to do just depend on God that
[18:29] he'll cuz I can't do it you can't do it
[18:31] you can you can pat somebody banks and
[18:33] know how you feel but but God knows how
[18:37] they feel the Holy Spirit knows exactly
[18:39] he knew how you felt before you even got
[18:41] here
[18:41] Amen so we just put our trust in that so
[18:44] let's bow our heads your father we pray
[18:47] today Lord that you would come among us
[18:50] in a special way Lord as we come through
[18:52] these seals we see now Lord that this is
[18:55] I believe the final push toward the end
[18:57] and this is Lord what it's going to have
[19:00] to take these things to get us where we
[19:03] need to be but father you saw that you
[19:06] knew that you put it in the word you put
[19:08] the ministry out there you gave us a
[19:10] prophet you gave us the Holy Ghost to
[19:12] understand so Lord we just need to yield
[19:16] to you father today we all need to yield
[19:18] ourselves to you order our whole body
[19:20] and mind and spirit Lord we pray this
[19:22] you would just take over and you do the
[19:23] work you do the revealing you do the
[19:26] preaching today father give us this day
[19:29] our daily bread and forgive us of our
[19:31] trespasses
[19:32] it was a
[19:33] on the foreign fields Lord give them
[19:35] fruit for their labor be the ones are on
[19:37] the highways traveling both Joe and Him
[19:39] Lord give them safe travel where they're
[19:40] going brother Louie's safe travel back
[19:42] home we were the direct Lord they've
[19:44] done what they need to do them in
[19:45] Maryland now they're tying up some loose
[19:47] ends down here Lord we pray that you
[19:49] just be with each one blessed this day
[19:52] give us a stare daily bread in Jesus
[19:54] name we pray amen and we had opened the
[19:58] third seal I heard the third beast say
[20:00] come and see and I'll be held in lo a
[20:02] black horse and he that sat on him a
[20:04] pair of balances in his hand I heard a
[20:06] voice in the midst before beasts say a
[20:08] measure of wheat for a penny and three
[20:10] measures of barley for a penny and see
[20:12] thou hurt not the oil and the wine has
[20:16] anybody caught what's missing and from
[20:19] one too what's missing in this one we'll
[20:21] talk about in just a second something
[20:23] very important is missing in this third
[20:25] seal you may be seizing the Lord has a
[20:27] blessing to the reading of the word
[20:29] something that we're really gonna have
[20:31] to look at the contrast because when you
[20:39] look at blag you wonder you know you
[20:41] take black and you go my blacks bad well
[20:44] we're going to read the Bible today at
[20:46] the very end and I'll pull some
[20:48] scriptures up where Paul that's all he's
[20:51] talking about is us being dead that's
[20:56] being dead because if we're alive then
[20:58] Christ can't live like Dwight Moody said
[21:01] you know God can fill those who are not
[21:03] full of ourselves so if we're dead you
[21:07] know Christ lives it's not eyelet living
[21:11] the Christ that liveth in me all right
[21:12] so let's begin let's look at our chart
[21:14] again we need to see show that it's
[21:16] Redemption Redemption Redemption we're
[21:18] showing that the breaking of the seal is
[21:20] not necessarily for the stole the
[21:22] soldiers were deemed by the new birth
[21:24] shed blood of Jesus constant Calvary now
[21:26] what do we work you know we're working
[21:27] on the now as God brought fellowship
[21:31] back the fellowship between Adam and God
[21:36] was lost because of his spiritual being
[21:39] his spirit realm not the soul didn't
[21:44] affect the soul listen listen that's why
[21:46] I want you to understand
[21:47] your soul if you're born again is your
[21:49] so protected your so protected because
[21:52] God can't hurt God it is God and that's
[22:01] what your soul is now by the baptism by
[22:04] the Holy Ghost by the new birth the one
[22:08] that come in you at your new birth is
[22:11] God the Creator the man himself that
[22:15] named every star that created what
[22:18] you're standing on and created you and
[22:26] when we run into problems and things in
[22:28] life and all the things that we go
[22:29] through
[22:30] that's not your soul remember brother
[22:33] Brown said your soul only feeds on the
[22:36] word now keep that in mind so your soul
[22:40] doesn't feed on all this peripheral
[22:43] things that we do in life okay you don't
[22:47] love your wife with your soul
[22:49] you love your wife you your spirit your
[22:52] feel your love because remember I got it
[22:54] love is only in the soul now listen I
[22:57] say only but it's got to work its way
[23:00] out because look that's not filial love
[23:03] now we start down here with filial love
[23:06] love of the Brethren love of the
[23:08] different things but when you get up to
[23:10] here that's why brotherly kindness
[23:12] brotherly kindness is not loving your
[23:14] brother will feel your love because you
[23:21] can't we're human beings some of you
[23:25] can't stand to be in the room with me
[23:26] some of y'all I can't stand being room
[23:28] with that's just where this that doesn't
[23:32] make us not Christians that's what
[23:35] brother Branham said need me to find the
[23:37] quote I find it where brother mom said
[23:39] you can't stand to be in the room with
[23:40] some people that's that outside guy
[23:44] memories and conscious facing
[23:46] imagination imagination but this
[23:48] brotherly kindness as they've been
[23:50] reading unfeigned love of the Brethren
[23:52] that's not common love all right so when
[23:56] we get to this seal I want you to watch
[23:59] what has happened because this thing
[24:01] got a part like the Red Sea you're quiet
[24:08] and that's okay because you don't know
[24:09] what I'm fixing to tell you this first
[24:14] seal in the second seal I'm gonna read
[24:18] them
[24:18] the Bible says power was given power was
[24:24] given go back to Revelation this is what
[24:28] I saw the other day really helped me to
[24:31] understand this seal better there's no
[24:36] power given in that seal there is a
[24:40] voice the voice of God that says
[24:44] whatever you're gonna do Satan that's
[24:46] fine but I am going to protect I am
[24:51] going to protect a group of people you
[24:54] can go off as far north as you want to
[24:57] go but you're gonna leave my oil and
[25:00] wine alone I'm not giving you any more
[25:03] power huh power was given power was
[25:10] given no power but now look on the other
[25:13] hand this is the problem that we're
[25:17] going to look at in a minute with
[25:18] specially with Cain now what's happened
[25:22] in this seal is is we got to these
[25:24] church ages and what's happened is Satan
[25:28] to need power from God he's got all the
[25:32] power in the people those denominational
[25:37] ideas that's why I was telling them
[25:39] downstairs physically killing someone
[25:43] it's not a problem
[25:45] but to spiritually kill somebody we were
[25:49] reading there in Romans where we
[25:52] actually got in the second chapter but
[25:53] in the first chapter of Romans he talks
[25:55] about covetous and idolaters and
[25:57] prostitutes and not the whole West you
[26:00] know how Paul lists those things down
[26:02] and then in then in Romans 2 he's
[26:07] talking about the same thing but he's
[26:09] not coming by physical
[26:11] he brings it to the spiritual part and
[26:14] says guys this is worse you're
[26:17] condemning the prostitute yeah you're
[26:22] prostituting yourself out to a
[26:24] denominational system in other words
[26:25] they weren't the denominator that was
[26:27] not a denominational system back in
[26:29] paul's age but there was a
[26:31] denominational spirit like brother
[26:34] branham's discerned the man going across
[26:36] the fore he said remember he said the
[26:39] guy was committing adultery he thought
[26:42] the brother now look he caught that from
[26:44] a spirit he didn't catch that from a
[26:46] vision let me make this point here
[26:49] because you make brother branham you
[26:52] know see something wrong he didn't catch
[26:54] that in the vision he caught that in the
[26:56] spiritual realm felt that spirit of
[26:59] adultery but remember he said God showed
[27:02] me when now when God showed him a vision
[27:04] he didn't show him the vision of the man
[27:07] in bed with another woman
[27:08] he's so division of this man what leanin
[27:12] the organized religion so that same
[27:14] spirit of adultery all the there in
[27:17] Romans 1 read the last I'm in all kind
[27:20] of old tale bears bla bla bla bla down
[27:22] through there say same devil a little
[27:26] different manifestation when it comes to
[27:28] the flesh that's why I tell you this
[27:30] flesh does not sin if you look on the
[27:34] woman to lust after her you've committed
[27:37] adultery already in your heart not in
[27:40] your body Jesus is bringing it up a
[27:43] little bit higher right so there in
[27:46] Romans we see that he's dealing with
[27:48] spirits well that's what we're dealing
[27:49] with we're dealing with spirits we're
[27:51] not dealing with people I told them this
[27:53] morning news thunderscope there's not a
[27:54] horse riding in your life it's the power
[27:58] it's a demon it's all those little imps
[28:03] all those little things that that you
[28:05] have problems with this satan sends
[28:08] these devils out but in this third seal
[28:12] God is dividing now look the only place
[28:16] God ever divides take everything we know
[28:21] and you break it down to two things
[28:25] filled with the Holy Ghost or not filled
[28:28] with you whatever you can preach for a
[28:33] hundred years you must be born again or
[28:38] you're not born again there's no halfway
[28:41] in between if you're in this group for
[28:44] this group now this group has divisions
[28:46] and Heights and depths this group has to
[28:51] you got the fullest version over here
[28:53] that's not in this group but yet they're
[28:57] virgins
[28:58] so you see you break it down though to
[29:00] two things you either got the Holy Ghost
[29:02] or you don't then you can play you know
[29:05] you can preach your levels and all
[29:07] different things so that's the same
[29:08] thing when we come to this third seal
[29:10] when then open and you say what you want
[29:15] to but I believe in its third seals
[29:18] where brother Bradley saw them grace a
[29:20] marriage and divorce I read it in a
[29:26] minute because you got to come down to
[29:30] where yeah he was preaching to people
[29:31] about physical marriage and divorce
[29:34] there's things we do in our body we must
[29:36] clear this out there aren't things that
[29:37] you do in your body you you can be
[29:40] forgiven but you can't be justified now
[29:42] that's a direct quote
[29:43] you'll be forgiven but you can't be
[29:44] justified okay and there are things that
[29:48] says in the Bible that if you do you
[29:50] can't do this so there's you see what
[29:51] I'm saying when I say this thing doesn't
[29:55] sin that doesn't mean that this thing
[29:57] can do what it wants to because look it
[29:58] don't do what it wants to do because
[30:02] Adam was in a flesh body walking around
[30:05] naked well and Georgia is naked walking
[30:09] around naked with Eve and there was no
[30:12] problem so where was the difference it
[30:18] was in his mind in his memory reason
[30:20] conscious defects an imagination right
[30:23] so we see we come to this seal here and
[30:26] God said alright I'm gonna divide this
[30:29] thing you can go off as far as you won't
[30:32] do this way but there's gonna be a group
[30:34] of people that you're not gonna be able
[30:36] to hurt
[30:37] while the only people he can't hurt or
[30:40] his own kids
[30:41] God can't hurt his own children so we
[30:45] see even in even in this dark blackness
[30:48] coming up that God has preserved a group
[30:52] of people and sent them over to the side
[30:53] because you know what once they come out
[30:55] of Nicaea and was killing the Christians
[30:58] and making them have the Roman doctrine
[31:02] and doing the novenas and and all that
[31:04] Catholicism you know so what did Satan
[31:08] do you got Catholicism you got
[31:13] Protestantism now this in itself is not
[31:17] exactly correct all they've done is just
[31:20] protested certain things that the
[31:22] Catholics did right so the pure word was
[31:28] not what was restored that's why like
[31:30] brother Dale says these are reformers
[31:32] [Music]
[31:33] they brought you from here over to here
[31:35] now what's happening now all Satan
[31:38] deines is okay in the end I'm gonna
[31:41] bring them all right back together again
[31:45] right and now what's gonna happen the
[31:48] Protestants and Catholics you heard that
[31:50] Tony Palmer several years ago he said
[31:53] you're protesting is over you know what
[31:56] he was telling them he was telling the
[31:59] group of people which were even
[32:01] Pentecostals that we believe same thing
[32:05] you do and ways that y'all believe same
[32:09] thing we do because the protesting was
[32:12] as Martin Luther was against the
[32:14] Catholic Church that's called projects
[32:17] they're protesting so what Satan done
[32:20] now God preserved a group of people
[32:22] through there but what happened was
[32:24] Satan just married them right back
[32:25] together again in the end time because
[32:29] that's what's gonna head up in the Beast
[32:30] the Beast system is working now but
[32:35] there's going to be a literal person
[32:36] that's going to be anointed by the devil
[32:40] incarnate devil that's going to bring
[32:42] this thing back together and he shall
[32:45] confirm the covenant with many for one
[32:47] week who's that he that he's the
[32:49] Antichrist through the Pope
[32:54] and we put it all on the Pope but
[32:56] somebody's gotta agree remember
[32:57] somebody's gotta agree to go in so it's
[33:00] not just all the Pope's fault
[33:02] somebody's gotta agree to go back
[33:04] somebody's gotta agree to knock all this
[33:06] down and come back together like Oh
[33:08] Satan's bringing them together but he'll
[33:10] never listen Satan will never take the
[33:14] bride off like that hurt not the oil and
[33:22] the wine hurt not the oil and the wine
[33:29] now let's get one because we've already
[33:31] read it before because remember we're
[33:35] looking at the mystery that is hid
[33:38] underneath the seal not the seal itself
[33:40] we know that seal is we got to break in
[33:44] the seals we're going to see it goes
[33:45] plumb back in the scripture we're going
[33:46] to see that today we're going to go back
[33:48] to Genesis for free for those fields the
[33:51] whole thing together the whole mystery
[33:53] lays right here in these seals steam
[33:56] every mystery of the Bible lays in these
[34:01] seals and the seals cannot be broken
[34:04] until that time I'll prove it just in a
[34:05] minute notice the book remember is
[34:06] sealed here's one here's their seal
[34:09] another one's wrapped around the seal
[34:10] the other one's wrapped it's a book of
[34:13] redemption and the whole thing together
[34:15] makes the book and it's sealed with
[34:16] seven seals and it begins on the
[34:18] backside skull just wound up we showed
[34:20] that the steal mystery is on the inside
[34:22] so we're looking what's on the inside
[34:24] we're not looking at just white red and
[34:27] black we know what these manifestations
[34:32] are but remember it's a contrast to what
[34:37] God's already do it even in that
[34:43] blackness that black horse God is
[34:48] protecting a group of people I mean he's
[34:52] protecting somebody why because the
[34:54] words got to get through them ages even
[34:57] if it's just a shoot or a stalk or
[34:59] whatever you want to say it's got to get
[35:00] through those ages because mm-hmm the
[35:03] Bible says enjoy
[35:04] restore what has been eat down what down
[35:08] to here
[35:10] now we know this is not the seed but its
[35:13] Bluff to shoot stock and then the tassel
[35:20] with the Pentecostals and then the full
[35:22] wheat back to maturity alright excuse me
[35:29] being us on the backside so just wound
[35:32] up the steel mysteries on the inside and
[35:33] only since white horse or black horse
[35:35] and whatever on the outside but the
[35:37] mystery of the whole book is in them
[35:38] seals from Genesis to Revelation a
[35:41] complete plan of redemption is revealed
[35:44] in those seven seals
[35:45] Orson important time God help us now the
[35:48] seal we just were talking about that
[35:52] let's go to the seal they don't want to
[35:56] show you something here in just a second
[35:58] we had opened the third seal I heard the
[36:00] third beast say come and see
[36:01] behold a little black horse he's our
[36:04] senator Mayer Powell bounces in his hand
[36:06] what is balanced is for balance is this
[36:08] for weight measurement even when you go
[36:13] to the court who's standing outside Miss
[36:17] Justice you wonder why it's a woman you
[36:24] wonder why some woman the bride the
[36:28] bride
[36:28] the bride's the judge the bride's listen
[36:33] we're going judge the whole work so you
[36:36] see the woman standing out there with
[36:37] the blindfold with the thing around her
[36:39] head what she got in her hand a pair of
[36:42] balances right right so man is
[36:45] testifying what's going to happen when
[36:49] the great judge comes when the great
[36:51] Justice happens it's going to be God's
[36:54] not going to say I said he's gonna say I
[36:56] had a group of people that walked among
[37:00] you that you shunned like I was telling
[37:03] them downstairs that's what we were
[37:06] talking about spirit God's not gonna
[37:08] come to the great white throne judgment
[37:11] and he's not going to have a list of
[37:13] things you did bad
[37:16] he doesn't have to ice Weis it there's
[37:19] only one thing on the list you either
[37:22] accepted me or you didn't other than
[37:26] that any of that that goes down through
[37:27] there you list a million things doesn't
[37:30] matter one thing he's gonna say I came
[37:33] to you on June the 4th not 2018 and I
[37:37] called your name I asked you I put
[37:40] somebody in your path you heard a
[37:43] preacher on the radio and you turned me
[37:47] down at that moment you know what that
[37:49] person is gonna stand there because
[37:50] that's the only person that knows what's
[37:52] going on he's gonna have to say yes
[37:57] that's exactly what happened now God's
[38:00] not gonna say well then you were an
[38:02] adulterer and you were a liar and your
[38:03] thief and you know u-turn god damn right
[38:07] so you get here's your judgment why the
[38:10] Bible says you'll be judged by your
[38:12] works if you're not born again you're
[38:13] gonna be judged by your words what did
[38:16] you accept him or did you not but a pair
[38:21] of balances in his hand but now look see
[38:25] what I'm saying
[38:26] when you come to this you see the
[38:27] symbolism of the just of the judge with
[38:32] the balances in her hand and who's the
[38:36] only person who judges if you have the
[38:38] Holy Ghost that is the judge if you
[38:42] don't have the Holy Ghost you will be
[38:44] judged so it's the judge and the judge
[38:47] okay
[38:49] so state we come down so I said that
[38:50] third seal is very important because
[38:52] it's gonna show you it's gonna narrow
[38:54] down and you got to figure out what
[38:57] group you're in no wiggle room here
[39:00] you're gonna have to figure out what
[39:01] group you're in and then you're gonna
[39:03] have to go that way
[39:04] remember what brother Brown said he said
[39:06] wherever you left God that's where you
[39:08] gotta come back to if the guns off you
[39:14] got to come back with that scope and you
[39:16] got to make the adjustment back here cuz
[39:20] this is where you got off and then so
[39:23] the people did they got off and they
[39:25] went to the blackness of denomination
[39:29] but out of that God protected a group of
[39:32] people that's going to judge the world
[39:35] now we know for a fact sure the the
[39:38] measure wheat for a penny and three
[39:40] measures of the barley for a penny we
[39:42] know that was the charging for novenas
[39:44] and now we say well that's Catholic
[39:46] Church let's get a little closer to home
[39:51] what about a preacher in this message
[39:54] preaching false doctrine and his group
[39:57] of people are paying his salary all that
[40:10] hurts
[40:11] look we're either gonna be 100% right
[40:18] somebody is are you wrong if one word
[40:23] got us out of the garden Eve then one
[40:27] word off its gonna keep us out of the
[40:28] garden Eve but God said I will restore
[40:33] what not-not-not
[40:36] I'm not going to restore back to Genesis
[40:38] for collapse wins Adam even Cain and
[40:43] Abel all came into being when all them
[40:45] spirits started happening no he's going
[40:47] to restore back what Adam and Eve in the
[40:50] Garden of Eden before the fall and then
[40:53] that's I will restore not I will prop up
[40:58] Satan to prop up but God restores back I
[41:02] believe for a moment we'll have an Eden
[41:06] here just like there was when Adam and
[41:07] Eve was on the earth and God can come
[41:10] down and not just speak with them but
[41:13] speak in them a major wheat for a penny
[41:18] three measures of barley for a penny see
[41:20] thou hurt not the oil and wine now that
[41:22] voice is not one of the four beasts now
[41:25] going up grow it up please I am sorry
[41:30] but I noticed - now remember stop
[41:33] praying like I said before power was
[41:34] given in the other two seals there's no
[41:36] power given in this seal to me the
[41:41] powers in the revelation of what that
[41:42] seal
[41:43] all right keep going up now third seal
[41:47] notice here's the good part now see thou
[41:49] hurt not this oil and wine just a little
[41:51] bit of it left brother don't you touch
[41:54] that now all it symbolizes the spirit
[41:55] the holy spirit I just want to read you
[41:57] what brother Brown said I'll give you a
[41:59] few verses if you want to in Leviticus
[42:01] 8:12 or Aaron before he went in to be
[42:02] anointed with all you know had to be
[42:04] anointed with all that ground 4:12 of
[42:07] oil coming pouring through the pipes and
[42:09] saying this is my spirit oil you know
[42:11] what you stub out the candlestick all
[42:13] right pouring the oil in another thing
[42:15] if you want to see Matthew 1425 there
[42:17] was a foolish virgin the foolish virgin
[42:19] had no oil no spirit because here we go
[42:23] down to two things again the spirit
[42:25] field and to not spare Phil okay now
[42:30] what we're going to get to right now
[42:32] we're we're gonna have an old moment is
[42:34] that there's a stimulation that goes
[42:36] with that now oil typifies spirit and
[42:41] wine simulates temp symbolizes
[42:45] stimulation of Revelation boy I like to
[42:48] run all over the place now look God was
[42:50] revealing this to brother Branham and he
[42:53] was about to run all over the place it's
[42:55] a wonder I didn't wake up the
[42:56] neighborhood and we sit here asleep
[43:05] listen it's a problem is y'all don't
[43:07] have stimulation you may have the Holy
[43:10] Ghost but you gotta have say you gotta
[43:12] have something that says well you're not
[43:15] singing this fine we can stand up wing
[43:17] sing and we can do this wing to this but
[43:19] when the preacher preaches you do this
[43:24] what are you praising Satan can come
[43:29] right in and give you a spirit to
[43:31] worship all you want to but he cannot
[43:33] give you a stimulation of Revelation
[43:37] that's something Satan that's why that
[43:40] that he's protected that oil and wine in
[43:45] the Bible is associated together always
[43:50] that's why it's brother Dale's preaching
[43:53] on the Holy Spirit
[43:56] you'll get a stimulation you may not run
[44:00] all over the place it's whatever you
[44:02] were born under it
[44:03] you know I some people do run and shout
[44:07] that's okay some people can't control
[44:09] herself
[44:10] some people can you know it's okay but
[44:13] what are you doing with it
[44:17] you see people shout and praise God
[44:19] worship and they come here about once
[44:21] every two weeks three weeks miss this
[44:24] service miss that you proven you don't
[44:28] have the real stimulation you may have
[44:30] the stimulation of something because
[44:34] memory reason conscious affects an
[44:36] imagination you can be stimulated but
[44:38] there's only one thing that can
[44:39] stimulate your soul and that's God
[44:42] that's the revelation that God gives you
[44:45] amen I swapped it when I saw that about
[44:50] the Bears in divorce yeah I didn't get
[44:54] up and run around the you know the pecan
[44:55] tree but it was a stimulation inside of
[44:58] me to cyst yeah that's what that is you
[45:01] know that you just say yeah thank you
[45:03] Lord that's what that is that's what all
[45:05] of you want you say yeah that's what
[45:07] that is
[45:08] stimulates in Revelation all the wine in
[45:10] the Bible is associated together always
[45:12] I got the concordance and look and
[45:14] there's a string of them that like that
[45:17] there's wine and oil going together all
[45:19] the time not let's go to the next one
[45:21] yeah bye all right say man all right cuz
[45:26] we fixing go to Land of Nod in a minute
[45:28] some of you have already went there
[45:31] we're going to the Bible to the Land of
[45:33] Nod so don't worry we're gonna do that
[45:35] then what does it say to this rider in
[45:37] black don't hurt my wine in my oil don't
[45:41] you touch it
[45:44] now that's bro Graham said that voice
[45:47] was the lamb so that was the Redeemer
[45:50] telling Satan you will not bother this
[45:55] group of people now sure you may bother
[45:57] but what I mean is you're not gonna send
[45:58] them off into hell no I'm gonna protect
[46:01] this group of people now I've got just a
[46:07] little bit of it down there but there's
[46:09] still a little
[46:10] there yes sir like brother Brown said
[46:13] Martin Luther had a dip for the Holy
[46:15] Ghost when I hate people I did for the
[46:17] Holy Ghost brother right I did for the
[46:22] Holy Ghost
[46:23] that's all right go that's the divine
[46:26] nature of God amen
[46:28] a dip or to get you stimulated now you
[46:33] can go on through and measure out all
[46:35] that kind of life that you're putting
[46:37] out that's up to you you're gonna pay
[46:39] for it down there but when you come
[46:41] across that wine and all you leave it
[46:44] alone man what a protector we have look
[46:48] in other words if you catch some of my
[46:51] little flock that's filled with my oil
[46:53] and wine wine and all the pure word and
[46:56] you're gonna kill them because you're
[46:58] doing that that's what you're doing
[47:00] don't you force them to say any Hail
[47:02] Marys or do anything like that or some
[47:10] of your Creed's even the ones that come
[47:11] through these this dark time that's what
[47:14] I was thinking about God knew that they
[47:18] would accept Father Son Holy Ghost
[47:19] baptism God knew they would accept these
[47:21] Trinitarian ideas but he held true that
[47:25] they were what Christian people you keep
[47:28] your hands off of them they know where
[47:31] they're going for they are anointed with
[47:35] my oil and by being anointing with my
[47:37] oil they have the wine of joy because
[47:41] they know my word of promise Martin
[47:43] Luther the just shall live by faith
[47:45] he was so happy with that he changed the
[47:50] world
[47:52] what if he had all this other what if
[47:55] he'd be sitting here today and listen
[47:56] for a few hours I bet you even be asleep
[48:00] he'd be sitting on the edge of that seat
[48:02] going tell me some more because you know
[48:04] what I'm just piling on that little bit
[48:06] that I got I got a little bit more I got
[48:08] a little bit more I got a little bit
[48:10] more I'm gonna raise them up again don't
[48:15] hurt that don't go trying to messing
[48:17] them up messing them up just keep away
[48:20] from them so God is protecting
[48:24] a group of people coming out of the Dark
[48:26] Age he's protecting a group of people
[48:29] because he knows God knows for sure that
[48:32] it's not going to come back around and
[48:35] it's fullness until today that just
[48:42] methods gonna cost you put them all
[48:43] together they're still here they're all
[48:49] in church now we're fixing to go right
[48:51] God knew that but there's a group he
[48:55] says you don't mess with these people
[48:56] right these people will hold the truth
[49:00] regardless of what anybody says that all
[49:04] right say man just keep away from them
[49:07] so now let's go the next the third seal
[49:10] truly is very important you see that or
[49:15] maybe you don't see it can you say man
[49:17] that third seal is important there's no
[49:21] power there then he has to give Satan
[49:24] well Satan is gonna ride off on his
[49:26] group but God's got a grip he's going to
[49:28] protect we've got the power in what in
[49:36] the name of Jesus it's protected by the
[49:38] Lamb I will restore not reform right all
[49:43] right now what happened we go back to
[49:47] Genesis and we know what happened
[49:49] let's go to Genesis 4 because we know we
[49:52] can tile the Bible together with the
[49:53] seals right am i all right saying man
[49:56] yeah cuz we face a goal and God where
[50:02] some of you are now but in Genesis look
[50:07] don't you see what's going on remember
[50:09] spirits not people spirits not people
[50:15] I'm gonna say it one more time spirits
[50:17] not people because in Genesis 2 Genesis
[50:24] 3
[50:25] what happened between Adam or between
[50:28] even the beasts and then brought out a
[50:30] man that was all by spirit if I got that
[50:35] same am Satan walked in the guard
[50:38] and anointed Eve all right but in
[50:43] genesis 3:15 what god say i will restore
[50:48] he just say that brother Wade well yay
[50:50] did if you'll read genesis 3:15 like I
[50:52] do
[50:53] I'll put enmity between what thy seed
[50:57] and the seed of the woman
[50:58] in other words brother Branham said
[50:59] he'll he promised he'd bring it back
[51:01] together and defeat Satan by that woman
[51:04] seed
[51:05] amen look so there's you promise but now
[51:08] watch this is the manifestation this is
[51:12] the sealed opening up in the book of
[51:14] Genesis not to steal literal this sealed
[51:17] spiritual the spirits were always there
[51:22] used to know what to name him because
[51:24] remember when we get to the fourth seal
[51:26] now we say well this guy's a murderer
[51:29] from the beginning
[51:31] he's death when he started even as a
[51:35] white horse Satan's death but in the
[51:38] fourth seal we become so so much
[51:43] stimulation of Revelation that we're
[51:45] able to know who is and call him by name
[51:48] see once you call somebody by name
[51:51] you've identified who they are and where
[51:53] they are the problem is is when we don't
[51:56] know where he is because he's slick and
[52:01] Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived
[52:03] and bare Cain said I've gotten a man
[52:05] from the Lord I got used my notes in my
[52:08] Bible now I didn't want to write them
[52:10] all down ain't one round like now
[52:13] where's Bob I thought bobby was gonna
[52:15] sell in front row today I guess he's not
[52:18] not gonna get spit on now the first
[52:23] thing he says is I've gotten a man from
[52:25] the Lord she's getting ready to you know
[52:30] we don't see this but you see that that
[52:34] that becomes a doctrine that becomes a
[52:39] doctrine cuz of people now in this day
[52:42] when you talk to them about the what
[52:46] happened in the garden the first thing
[52:47] they bring up they say oh he said I got
[52:51] a man
[52:52] well she did but that's not what we're
[52:57] talking about so what's a new he just
[53:00] all Satan has to do is just diverts your
[53:03] attention and he's got you like I've
[53:06] always said you know you you see the the
[53:08] man sitting on the fence
[53:09] you always got fence sitters lot of you
[53:13] you got fence sitters I'll just sit on
[53:16] this fence and I'll be so close to it if
[53:18] things get bad I'll fall over in the
[53:20] Christian side so Satan walks up one day
[53:23] and said what are you doing sitting on
[53:24] the fence he said well I don't know I
[53:27] don't really know about going on this
[53:29] side I trim my hair a little bit I don't
[53:31] come to church when I don't feel good
[53:32] blow Satan says well you know I own that
[53:39] fence don't you he'll get it in law
[53:49] you're already on his ground he's just
[53:53] got you food I thought we were supposed
[53:57] to flee from the appearance of evil
[54:00] shunning the appearance of evil flee
[54:02] from all these not settling the fence
[54:04] and she again Bears brother Abel and
[54:07] Abel was a keeper of sheep but came with
[54:08] the tiller of the ground now watch now
[54:10] watch what happened and in the process
[54:12] of time in other words it's not just a
[54:14] one moment thing they're getting older
[54:17] and you know what they're talking to
[54:19] each other
[54:20] Cain has an idea and Abel has an idea at
[54:27] that point in time they're talking all
[54:29] right is everybody okay with that
[54:30] they're talking and in the process of
[54:34] time it came to pass that Cain started
[54:38] bringing the fruit of his doctrine that
[54:42] okay gangs started bringing I want you
[54:45] to watch now don't put Cain and they're
[54:47] put spirit and that spirit don't die
[54:50] Cain's in the ground somewhere dead but
[54:52] that spirit still here in this room
[54:56] today and in the process of time it came
[55:00] to pass that Cain brought through the
[55:01] ground an offering unto the Lord now who
[55:04] do you bring it to
[55:05] the devil no he knew to come to church
[55:09] brother Brown said he built an altar at
[55:13] the wall comes remember they were driven
[55:15] out he said came built an altar against
[55:20] the wall Abel booth announced her
[55:22] against the wall it wasn't he came went
[55:24] off and started making wine and started
[55:26] drinking and having affairs
[55:28] she I'm saying it's just a doctrine and
[55:32] Abel he also brought of the firstlings
[55:34] of his flock look at the difference and
[55:36] the Lord had respect unto Abel and to
[55:40] his offering but into Cain and his
[55:46] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[55:50] very forgiving and he said please will
[55:52] you forgive me oh that's not ways then
[55:57] right
[55:58] Cain was very mad and he couldn't even
[56:06] hide it his countenance fell
[56:12] watch how these spears no watch now
[56:14] watch the Lord and the Lord look at that
[56:16] capital LRD that wasn't a bishop talking
[56:19] to Adam talking to Cain that was the
[56:23] Lord capital L Ord spoke directly to
[56:26] Cain and said why are you Roth now look
[56:31] you said why did God ask him that he
[56:33] already knew the problem he's got to get
[56:36] a confession he's got to get a
[56:39] confession and the Lord said unto Cain
[56:41] why art thou wroth and why is thy
[56:45] countenance fallen now watch
[56:50] can you see though that this white
[56:52] righteous church that we're talking
[56:54] about
[56:55] there's Cain taking his offering to God
[57:01] in church the fruit of his doctrine same
[57:09] thing with the first seal
[57:11] white righteous church cane Hey look
[57:14] can't look good to a point if you were
[57:18] looking at an outsider you would look at
[57:22] cane and he probably had or just a
[57:25] hundred different colors and he probably
[57:27] had them all set up just right then
[57:29] beautiful orange and red and yelling and
[57:31] then look over here a lamb with his
[57:35] tongue hanging out and Abel wakes his
[57:39] throat blood probably splatters against
[57:42] the wall and dill and the poor things
[57:44] you know and and you look at that and
[57:48] you're writing a comment and you said
[57:49] when I mr. Cain's doctrine looks a lot
[57:51] better than mr. Abel amen but it was
[57:56] totally opposite that's why that when
[57:59] you go over to the Book of Revelations
[58:00] he talked about spirits not dying you go
[58:04] over the Book of Revelations John saw
[58:06] the and he admired her brother
[58:13] Branham said in other words brother Ram
[58:15] said that angel had to divert his
[58:17] attention away from that beautiful
[58:19] church same doctrine same thing from
[58:22] Cain same spirit if thou do as well
[58:29] though remember there was a white
[58:31] righteous church on the earth at the
[58:32] time Abel was right and what he done and
[58:35] what God was trying to do was get came
[58:37] to convert he was looking for a
[58:40] conversion a confession if thou doest
[58:44] well shalt thou not be accepted and if
[58:47] thou doest not well sin life that's your
[58:53] door anthems these shall be his desire
[58:57] and thou shalt rule over him knowing
[58:59] that that things fixing to take over
[59:01] Cain totally take over Cain now watch
[59:07] now there's your white horse the white
[59:10] horse was two white righteous but one
[59:13] seeming white righteous and one is what
[59:15] righteous Abel was righteous you go to
[59:17] you go to Hebrews 11 it says righteous
[59:19] Abel cannot
[59:24] but now what happened watch when this
[59:26] watch when the second seal open and Cain
[59:32] talked with Abel now what they talked
[59:35] about what was on sale at Walmart they
[59:43] talked about what just happened why did
[59:47] God accept your sacrifice
[59:50] well they started talking and what DK
[59:54] knew Cain killed Abel because of a
[59:57] doctrine what was the second seal read
[1:00:05] remember he rode through that church and
[1:00:08] killed the people Cain talked with Abel
[1:00:12] his brother and he came to pass now what
[1:00:15] happened was there must have been
[1:00:17] several conversations this is not just
[1:00:21] like brother Dale said you can't read
[1:00:22] this and think this was that happened in
[1:00:23] a moment Cody said and it came to pass
[1:00:26] which could be any length of time when
[1:00:29] they were in the field so they wherever
[1:00:31] they were talking they had to go in the
[1:00:32] field that Cain rose up now wide it came
[1:00:35] kill Abel because of his doctrine not
[1:00:40] because it was his brother not because
[1:00:42] of the doctrine they were talking about
[1:00:44] they could not agree so Cain something
[1:00:51] rose up in Cain and he slew Abel same
[1:00:56] way with here everybody all right say
[1:00:59] man cuz what and the Lord said unto Cain
[1:01:03] now hello our day here the Lord comes
[1:01:05] back down again and said unto Cain where
[1:01:11] is Abel thy brother you say well he knew
[1:01:12] were it sure did he wants a confession
[1:01:15] he's gotta have a confession and the
[1:01:19] Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy
[1:01:21] brother that's why I'm telling you we
[1:01:23] talked about these seals and we talked
[1:01:25] about the statue a perfect man God wants
[1:01:28] a confession I'm in the message that's
[1:01:33] not a confession
[1:01:34] a confession is as I understand and I am
[1:01:43] stimulated by what God brings me because
[1:01:47] of this message hey man the Lord said to
[1:01:50] Cain where is Abel thy brother and he
[1:01:51] said I know not
[1:01:52] well you liar am I my brother's keeper
[1:01:57] now boy there's a lot of repentance in
[1:01:59] that cuz you see what Cain's doing he's
[1:02:02] he's going further away from God
[1:02:05] you know what God's going with him God's
[1:02:11] walking with him all the way down here
[1:02:15] the Lord still with Cain he's right
[1:02:17] there with Cain he's right there with
[1:02:19] anybody walking through these ages
[1:02:23] trying to get them to turn but there'll
[1:02:26] be a point where you can't turn or when
[1:02:30] you make your turn you can't get back
[1:02:32] okay excuse me the Lord syndicating
[1:02:36] where's Abel thy brother and he said I
[1:02:38] know not am I my brother's keeper and he
[1:02:41] said what hast thou done the voice
[1:02:45] there's no blood has a voice but the
[1:02:50] life that was in that blade was the
[1:02:53] voice you know what happened Abel was in
[1:02:57] another dimension he actually was there
[1:03:00] with God I believe right there not not
[1:03:03] in the sixth dimension but he was there
[1:03:04] he had to go somewhere he wasn't on the
[1:03:06] earth he was dead the voice of my
[1:03:10] brother's blood crieth unto me from the
[1:03:14] ground Satan says look or Cain says look
[1:03:21] the brother Bram says when he gets on my
[1:03:23] brother and my brother's keeper brother
[1:03:25] Brown said he says God take it or leave
[1:03:30] it
[1:03:31] what'd he say his confession was is I'm
[1:03:34] done with whatever you try to say to me
[1:03:36] that's the same thing let's see what
[1:03:38] this baby form they weren't called
[1:03:41] denominations until you get right here
[1:03:43] so those of you can't see right here
[1:03:46] these are not denominations but that
[1:03:48] same spirits working all way through
[1:03:50] that same spirit to put Jesus on the
[1:03:52] cross is still here today and now art
[1:04:01] thou cursed God finally said this is
[1:04:05] enough now art thou cursed from the
[1:04:11] earth which opened up her mouth to
[1:04:13] receive thy brother's blood from thy
[1:04:15] hand when thou tillest the ground it
[1:04:17] showing up and forth yield you know what
[1:04:21] he's talking about
[1:04:22] in other words came whatever doctrine
[1:04:26] comes out of this it's not gonna yield
[1:04:29] any fruit
[1:04:31] it's a denominational Creed or a
[1:04:33] denominational idea and it's not gonna
[1:04:36] yield my fruit well now tell us the
[1:04:39] ground it show not him forth yielding to
[1:04:41] thee her strength a fugitive and a
[1:04:44] vagabond shalt thou be in the earth and
[1:04:47] Cain said unto the Lord forgive me Lord
[1:04:50] no he didn't he said my punishment is
[1:04:54] greater than I can bear he's looking for
[1:04:58] sympathy he ain't gonna get it be old
[1:05:04] thou hast driven me out this day from
[1:05:06] the face of the earth and from thy face
[1:05:08] shall I be hid and I should be a
[1:05:10] fugitive and a vagabond in the earth he
[1:05:12] just read quote when God said and it
[1:05:13] shall come to pass that everyone that
[1:05:15] findeth me shall slay me now watch what
[1:05:17] God did God said hang on just a minute
[1:05:22] and the Lord said unto him therefore
[1:05:25] whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall
[1:05:27] be taken on him 7 fold so in other words
[1:05:36] God is going to allow through seven
[1:05:38] church ages that doctrine of Cain is
[1:05:41] going to go all the way through come
[1:05:43] there's no way that God comes remember
[1:05:45] God said I will restore so something had
[1:05:50] to go down so that God can restore it
[1:05:53] back
[1:05:54] amen vengeance shall be taken on him
[1:05:59] Sevenfold in other words in seven
[1:06:02] search agent it's gonna take seven
[1:06:03] Church ages to get rid of that doctrine
[1:06:06] cuz that's what we're dealing with today
[1:06:08] we're dealing with the doctrine of Cain
[1:06:10] you can call it whatever you want to and
[1:06:12] then and the Lord set a mark upon Cain
[1:06:14] lest any finding him should kill him
[1:06:18] alright so there's your black horse the
[1:06:23] man anointing God's telling Kane I'm not
[1:06:27] gonna kill you sure he died physically
[1:06:30] but spiritually down through the church
[1:06:32] ages now what Mark did he put on Kane
[1:06:35] here's what they asked brother branham
[1:06:37] is this where the black people came from
[1:06:38] that's about pitiful to ask that
[1:06:41] question right but what mark was it
[1:06:47] brother James Colley what mark was it is
[1:06:51] the mark of the beast cuz remember
[1:06:53] somebody asked that question and the
[1:06:55] ministers meeting or something and you
[1:06:56] remember you just read it it's been 30
[1:06:59] years ago you probably don't even
[1:07:00] remember that big way that's part of the
[1:07:05] curse brother Colley I'm sorry but
[1:07:07] daddy's told a story several times about
[1:07:09] brother Colley just read that so much so
[1:07:11] my acid or watch the market was put on
[1:07:13] Cain brother Brown said it was a market
[1:07:15] beef
[1:07:15] well what is the mark of the beast
[1:07:17] anything against God anything against
[1:07:21] the doctrine of God is the mark of the
[1:07:24] beast
[1:07:24] now Cain's problem was is right here and
[1:07:31] Cain went out from the presence of the
[1:07:34] Lord and went to the Land of Nod and
[1:07:38] never returned to God amen is that our
[1:07:45] problem because you don't want to get
[1:07:50] out of the presence of God you want to
[1:07:52] get into the presence of God you get
[1:07:55] into the Shekinah glory of God and I'll
[1:07:57] promise you if Cain would have repented
[1:08:00] I'm not joking people if Cain would have
[1:08:03] repented God would have accepted his
[1:08:06] repentance
[1:08:08] but when he got to right there that mark
[1:08:11] did he put on Cain that was it
[1:08:13] he was done you know why he rejected
[1:08:18] what God was giving him it's like I said
[1:08:21] before God's not gonna send you to hell
[1:08:24] for being a liar cheat thief he's gonna
[1:08:27] send people to hell for what turning the
[1:08:29] word down and Cain went out from the
[1:08:35] presence of the Lord so we got to this
[1:08:36] seal here we'll finish up here in a few
[1:08:38] minutes just been going right into that
[1:08:40] one let's go to job 1224 but now you see
[1:08:46] how that spirit now look don't look at
[1:08:48] people look at spirits that motivate
[1:08:51] people like I read to y'all before the
[1:08:54] other day couple Sundays ago brother
[1:08:57] Brown said I'm not against you people
[1:08:59] I'm against that denomination that
[1:09:01] you're in now what that denomination did
[1:09:04] is give them a spirit and it wasn't the
[1:09:09] Holy Spirit brother Brown I'll read it
[1:09:13] to you next Sunday well just pull up
[1:09:16] dead domination and read her brother Ram
[1:09:17] said about it that's what it was
[1:09:20] Cain started a dead denomination he said
[1:09:25] that's been six thousand years ago
[1:09:26] people been like living yeah they're
[1:09:28] living but they're dead joke 1224 listen
[1:09:33] he taketh away the heart of the chief of
[1:09:35] the people of the earth no as soon as
[1:09:36] this Satan excuse me and causes them to
[1:09:39] wondering they wilderness where there is
[1:09:42] no way go talk to somebody in two
[1:09:46] denominations right now I've talked to
[1:09:48] two or three and they're just so done
[1:09:51] Jim talked to some sister some girl came
[1:09:53] in the store the other day I said she's
[1:09:57] done with denominations she want to know
[1:09:59] what we believe Jim said then you know
[1:10:02] give her a little bit of why we do what
[1:10:04] we do and what the Bible says about it
[1:10:07] not that brother Branham said that woman
[1:10:09] didn't care what brother Branham said
[1:10:10] didn't care that she didn't care that
[1:10:12] was a prophet here if she comes in so
[1:10:15] you'll learn that but she was tired
[1:10:19] she's I've been here I've been
[1:10:20] you look at the people they just they're
[1:10:22] all there wandering around in the
[1:10:23] wilderness they know we're getting close
[1:10:25] to the end time they grope in the dark
[1:10:30] because remember the foolish virgin they
[1:10:33] feel something happening and they jump
[1:10:35] right in there and said we want some oil
[1:10:38] they grope in the dark without light and
[1:10:42] he maketh them to stagger like a drunken
[1:10:46] man that's what that spirit of cane will
[1:10:48] give you all right Luke 11:30 for the
[1:10:54] light of the body is the eye
[1:10:56] therefore when that I be saying is
[1:10:58] single thy whole body also is full of
[1:11:00] light but when deny is evil the body is
[1:11:05] also full of darkness
[1:11:08] take heed therefore that the light which
[1:11:11] is in thee be not darkness first Timothy
[1:11:24] five six and I'll make a comment about
[1:11:25] that in a second first Timothy 5 6 but
[1:11:28] she
[1:11:28] now what is this she she is a church a
[1:11:33] woman the she is that everybody agrees a
[1:11:36] man even those who either sleep salmon
[1:11:40] ok I'm crying wake up dead people but
[1:11:49] she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[1:11:53] while she liveth if that light in you be
[1:11:58] darkness how great is that darkness you
[1:12:02] know what the problem is you think it's
[1:12:04] like you hold it as light but it's
[1:12:10] darkness that's why this Black Horse
[1:12:15] caused those denominations to go the way
[1:12:19] they went
[1:12:23] that's the worst black you'll ever get
[1:12:26] is to think you're right
[1:12:30] in your own right look what's this
[1:12:35] revelations 3-1 this is exactly the
[1:12:38] fifth church age right to start easing
[1:12:39] Church AIDS and to the angel of the
[1:12:41] church in sardis because look we're
[1:12:44] typing it with the two ages here Sardis
[1:12:47] and Philadelphia and then you got loud
[1:12:49] to see yeah we're right in here is where
[1:12:51] in Sardis Ian in Philadelphia Church
[1:12:53] ages it's when all the denominations
[1:12:55] began to name themself Baptist Methodist
[1:12:59] Pentecostal whatever and the angel of
[1:13:01] the church in Sardis nays right into the
[1:13:03] church in Sardis these things says he
[1:13:07] that hath the seven spirits of God and
[1:13:09] the Seven Stars I know thy works that
[1:13:12] thou hast a name that thou livest and
[1:13:15] art dead Wow they'll have a name that
[1:13:20] they'll live is and art dead what will
[1:13:25] we take father son holy go will we take
[1:13:28] a Trinitarian doctor a name that they'll
[1:13:32] live in our dead Baptist Methodist
[1:13:36] Pentecostal now randomized if you want
[1:13:39] to make your own denomination but that's
[1:13:42] what happened mm-hmm if that lie didn't
[1:13:45] you be darkness how great is that
[1:13:46] darkness but God said he said I will
[1:13:50] restore and I'm gonna bring something
[1:13:51] back cuz watch here we now let's go to
[1:13:55] the flip side and we'll finish well we
[1:14:00] may not and as they came down from the
[1:14:02] mountain Jesus charged him saying tell
[1:14:04] the vision to no man until the Son of
[1:14:07] Man be risen again from the dead
[1:14:11] now the Son of man didn't physically die
[1:14:15] right son of man did physically God the
[1:14:19] Son of man died one time at Calvary for
[1:14:21] all of us but what did they do they
[1:14:23] buried him in the Dark Ages they buried
[1:14:26] him under denominational idea mm-hmm a
[1:14:29] man called the son of man is the sort of
[1:14:32] the see the son of man is what promise
[1:14:34] come back in the end time amen
[1:14:36] until the Son of man be risen again from
[1:14:39] the dead what those dead denominations
[1:14:41] there's people coming out of them broke
[1:14:43] ready Wednesday night the dead
[1:14:46] denomination's there's people coming out
[1:14:48] what a wait how they sleep aren't gonna
[1:14:53] read that buy took it out because you
[1:14:55] already ready and here's the sample
[1:14:57] asked him saying why then shall the
[1:14:59] Scott say the sky that'll last much
[1:15:01] first come they know I just got to come
[1:15:03] remember I preached a long time ago
[1:15:05] about the five cups of a larger every
[1:15:08] year in Israel they sit down in a meal
[1:15:11] and they put a cup they fill it full of
[1:15:14] wine and they get ready to have a meal
[1:15:17] they walk out the door they look down
[1:15:20] the street that's away and down the
[1:15:21] street that way they're looking for
[1:15:23] Elijah and if he don't show up they just
[1:15:28] say until next year go back inside take
[1:15:32] the cup empty it and put it back on the
[1:15:34] shelf
[1:15:34] now they do that now they know Elijah
[1:15:37] could see when that fifth coming of
[1:15:39] Elijah comes they'll know who he is
[1:15:42] 144,000 to know who he is but see the
[1:15:46] forthcoming of Elijah is what they
[1:15:47] missed but we get them all we understand
[1:15:52] every one of them and jesus answered and
[1:15:55] said i let me last truly shall first
[1:15:58] come and restore all things now look
[1:16:01] John the Baptist did not do that it was
[1:16:06] to all things his message was the
[1:16:08] kingdom of heaven his hand but brother
[1:16:11] Branham that Elisha that spirit of
[1:16:13] Elijah all William Branham that was his
[1:16:18] promise to come back in restore the
[1:16:20] faith and the father's back so he's
[1:16:23] telling us right there but the Son of
[1:16:25] man has got to be risen again from the
[1:16:26] dead not physically dead like I said
[1:16:29] before one more time
[1:16:30] I've gotta be physically dead then
[1:16:32] spiritually dead if I'm physically dead
[1:16:35] with the Holy Ghost I'm not dead I'll
[1:16:40] prove it to you in a minute
[1:16:41] Romans 6 verse 1 mm-hmm this is our
[1:16:45] water baptism scripture every time we do
[1:16:49] a baptism we read the scripture why call
[1:16:51] this a death a burial and resurrection
[1:16:56] and then what shall we say then shall we
[1:16:59] continue in sin that grace may abound
[1:17:00] Paul well you don't pout god forbid how
[1:17:04] shall we that are dead to sin look at
[1:17:09] the protection we're dead to sin if
[1:17:12] you're born to get in your soul it don't
[1:17:14] see in let's say something to me the
[1:17:21] other day she said when we really
[1:17:22] realize what we got inside levels that I
[1:17:24] I let her preach for a couple hours all
[1:17:26] that yeah I mean really say that our
[1:17:30] soul is gone have I sinned my day of
[1:17:34] grace away if you're born again no you
[1:17:37] may have problems in your spirit realm
[1:17:40] but greater is He that is in me how
[1:17:45] shall we that are dead to sin whoa Paul
[1:17:47] what mercy let's see dead unbelief your
[1:17:52] soul does not disbelieve how can God
[1:17:58] just believe itself right no you're not
[1:18:04] I can't get too excited sorry I'm gonna
[1:18:07] be finished with this in a few days no
[1:18:10] you're not
[1:18:11] there's so many of us as were baptized
[1:18:13] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:18:15] death therefore we are buried with him
[1:18:17] by baptism into death that like as
[1:18:21] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:18:23] the glory of the Father even so we also
[1:18:25] should walk in newness of life for if we
[1:18:28] have been planted together because the
[1:18:33] Bible says we plant them in corruption
[1:18:35] that's what you do when you go outside
[1:18:37] what do you do when we go to the funeral
[1:18:40] you just plant in the body you plant
[1:18:44] you're putting the earth back into Earth
[1:18:45] there's not a soul there there's not a
[1:18:47] spirit that you're planting the you're
[1:18:49] planting what came out of the earth back
[1:18:51] in there but if you're born again Dayton
[1:18:53] same spirit that raised up Jesus from
[1:18:55] the dead come back and get that body
[1:18:56] clicking that mortal body bring it back
[1:18:58] up Bible says we plant them in
[1:19:02] corruption we raise them in in
[1:19:04] corruption
[1:19:05] well the Bible's perfect if we have been
[1:19:08] planted
[1:19:09] whether in the likeness of his death we
[1:19:11] shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:19:15] resurrection knowing this that our old
[1:19:17] man is crucified now Jesus died on the
[1:19:21] cross his flesh body died our old man is
[1:19:26] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:19:28] might be destroyed they him forth we
[1:19:30] should not serve sin for he that is dead
[1:19:33] it's free from sin our problem is is
[1:19:39] maybe we're not all dead maybe just we
[1:19:43] went through a divorce we didn't like
[1:19:45] our husband for a while so we separated
[1:19:47] from here but if these dads that's why I
[1:19:50] said about marriage and divorce watch
[1:19:51] this you keep going through mayors in
[1:19:53] divorce I'll get to it a minute oh no
[1:19:59] I'll get to it next Sunday because the
[1:20:01] Lord showed me something about that too
[1:20:03] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:20:05] the dead dies no more look if we be dead
[1:20:08] with Christ now Paul's alive physically
[1:20:13] alive at this moment but he's dead in
[1:20:16] Christ that's why the Bible says we'll
[1:20:19] read in it when the dead in Christ shall
[1:20:20] rise first they're not dead in the
[1:20:22] ground they died Christ while they were
[1:20:25] still alive now if we be dead with
[1:20:28] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:20:30] live with him knowing that Christ being
[1:20:33] raised from the dead dies no more death
[1:20:37] hath no more dominion over him for him
[1:20:42] that he died he died unto sin once but
[1:20:44] and that he liveth he liveth unto God I
[1:20:46] know summing up Paul likewise reckon ye
[1:20:50] also yourselves to be dead indeed under
[1:20:53] sin but alive unto God through Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ our Lord
[1:20:57] then we baptized them amen
[1:21:01] I love that scripture for a baptismal
[1:21:03] scripture let's go and read Romans 7 we
[1:21:07] got about five more minutes only 3:30
[1:21:08] mm-hmm no you're not brethren for I
[1:21:11] speak to them that know the law and for
[1:21:15] those of you that don't go downstairs
[1:21:16] for the Sunday School class rodell's
[1:21:20] talked about interpolating you see what
[1:21:22] Paul was doing
[1:21:23] you see the parentheses just to give you
[1:21:27] a little something extra I'm not gonna
[1:21:27] charge you for this for I speak to them
[1:21:30] that know the law
[1:21:31] that's interpolating because really
[1:21:32] reading it like this you read no you're
[1:21:35] not brethren how that the law have to
[1:21:36] mean over man as long as he liveth what
[1:21:38] poles doing is the Holy Spirit stopping
[1:21:41] in and said hey explain this a little
[1:21:43] bit further because you're talking real
[1:21:45] plain but let's insert this now I didn't
[1:21:49] say interpreting I said interpolating
[1:21:52] this would be different for I speak to
[1:21:56] them that know the law all right so now
[1:21:58] we know who something up how that the
[1:22:01] law had to mean over men as long as he
[1:22:03] liveth for the woman which hath an
[1:22:05] husband is bound by the law to her
[1:22:07] husband so long as he liveth now look
[1:22:09] we're talking about dance we tell my
[1:22:10] black we're coming my dad but if the
[1:22:13] husband be dead you say physical husband
[1:22:18] you can say whatever you want say
[1:22:23] because that's our problem
[1:22:26] you give him you give Satan the belly a
[1:22:29] writing of divorcement
[1:22:30] he's still there amen he's still there
[1:22:37] that's just like and I'm gonna be
[1:22:38] playing some of you that have living
[1:22:40] wives that you've divorced in whatever
[1:22:42] you know that's marriage and divorce you
[1:22:44] decide that all yourself but I like what
[1:22:47] brother Jess Trammell said he said the
[1:22:50] Bible says a double minded man is
[1:22:52] unstable he said I say a double married
[1:22:55] man it's unstable you know why that's
[1:22:57] not saying anything wrong what I'm
[1:23:00] saying is you always got that living
[1:23:02] something that you lookin back to you
[1:23:04] got a connection with you man I'm
[1:23:07] talking in your humanity you hear me in
[1:23:10] your humanity you do have a living life
[1:23:12] I don't care if you think she's dead if
[1:23:13] she's breathing this sucking air she's
[1:23:15] alive or him so you've always got that
[1:23:19] that will bother you and you'll lean
[1:23:20] toward same thing I'm talking about
[1:23:23] spiritual now if Satan is not dead in
[1:23:25] your soul he's alive and he'll always
[1:23:29] bother you but you can't divorce if your
[1:23:34] husband is dead she
[1:23:36] loose from the law hallelujah that's
[1:23:42] what God came to do he didn't come to
[1:23:44] divorce the mighty conquer came to kill
[1:23:49] your husband so he can marry you
[1:23:56] you don't married to Christ if you got a
[1:23:58] new birthing you soul you're married
[1:23:59] across all right that okay listen
[1:24:02] whatever we're not here to preach
[1:24:04] marriage in divorce but you see where I
[1:24:06] think brother branham got that cuz he
[1:24:07] said marriage and divorce was revealed
[1:24:09] in the field and that right if the old
[1:24:14] husband be dead she is loosed from the
[1:24:17] law of her husband do you know if if
[1:24:18] your husband has passed away
[1:24:21] you're just as free to marry as a virgin
[1:24:26] what the Bible said hey man this is you
[1:24:31] okay not a problem none it's all done
[1:24:35] that's why with Christ if we'll
[1:24:37] understand that then for our old husband
[1:24:39] is dead why do we want to resurrect him
[1:24:43] he's dead
[1:24:45] you're loosed we just read that you're
[1:24:47] loose from that responsibility of that
[1:24:50] first life you had how it's God if not
[1:24:54] divorce it's not over here somewhere oh
[1:24:56] you're on your mind but it's not over
[1:24:58] here where it can be accounted against
[1:25:00] you it's gone we've seen that so my sins
[1:25:05] are gone do we really believe it so then
[1:25:11] if while her husband liveth she be
[1:25:13] married to another man I'm just reading
[1:25:15] you the Bible she shall be called an
[1:25:17] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[1:25:20] she is free from that law so she is no
[1:25:25] adulteress and she no marry another man
[1:25:27] now remember only in the Lord if you're
[1:25:30] Christian only in the Lord can't just go
[1:25:32] marry any other man you won't thing okay
[1:25:34] I told you I'm not preaching marriage
[1:25:36] and divorce but I believe that's where
[1:25:38] brother Branham saw that show me
[1:25:39] anywhere else that he come out wherefore
[1:25:42] my brethren you also are become dead to
[1:25:44] the law by the body of Christ now who is
[1:25:47] he he's your husband that he should be
[1:25:49] married to
[1:25:50] another even to him who is raised from
[1:25:53] the den don't we tell Matt new in us
[1:25:55] Jesus Christ that we should bring forth
[1:25:57] fruit unto God from when we were in the
[1:25:59] flesh the motions of sin which were by
[1:26:02] the law did work in our members to bring
[1:26:05] forth fruit unto death but now we are
[1:26:09] delivered from the law that being dead
[1:26:13] wherein we were held think about what
[1:26:16] held these people what killed these
[1:26:19] people why are they waiting on us why
[1:26:22] because they're physically dead they're
[1:26:25] not spiritually dead if they're born
[1:26:27] again they're waiting oh me and you but
[1:26:30] there's untold millions and especially
[1:26:31] dead that being dead wherein we were
[1:26:35] held that we should serve in newness of
[1:26:38] spirit and not in the oldest of the
[1:26:42] letter Jesus Christ our Lord amen
[1:26:47] let's read a few morning's stand to your
[1:26:50] feet start with commune let's go ahead
[1:26:51] and stand Colossians 3 verse 32 look set
[1:26:54] your affections on things above not on
[1:26:56] things on the earth for ye are dead yea
[1:27:00] ye are dead and your life is hid with
[1:27:05] Christ in God
[1:27:08] 1st Thessalonians 4:15 very familiar for
[1:27:11] this we say unto you by the word the
[1:27:13] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[1:27:15] say that would mean that we boy y'all
[1:27:20] are so weak that way I can't say it can
[1:27:24] you say we thank you we what you're
[1:27:28] alive cuz that's what you are right now
[1:27:29] if you ever found yourself in the
[1:27:31] scripture right there you are today
[1:27:33] right there that we which are alive and
[1:27:36] remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:27:38] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:27:40] which are what asleep not dead for the
[1:27:45] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:27:46] with a shout voice of the Archangel
[1:27:48] Trump of guards what you listening to
[1:27:49] now and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:27:53] first one more second Timothy 2 verse 11

[1:29:53] barrier around each one it's a fire of
[1:29:56] God there's a wall of fire as a song as
[1:30:00] the lily of the valley I love that song
[1:30:02] there's a wall of fire around me and
[1:30:04] nothing out of fear when it's the fire

[1:31:38] we do let's just have a few moments of
[1:31:40] silent prayer waiting on the Lord and
[1:31:41] just praying one for the other before we
[1:31:44] go on into the reading of the scriptures
[1:31:46] and thing and get our hearts tired
[1:31:48] before the Lord
[1:32:00] other we thank you for the grace of your
[1:32:02] love that you've bestowed upon us that
[1:32:04] your word would have the answer to all
[1:32:07] of our questions
[1:32:08] thank you for your godly guiding and
[1:32:11] your leading of us in our understanding
[1:32:13] and just have your way
[1:32:15] now we ask you to come and Lord as we
[1:32:18] change a little salton to go into the
[1:32:21] communion and foot washing and Lord that
[1:32:23] you'd prepare our hearts for these
[1:32:25] things and that you cleanse us all from
[1:32:27] run righteousness and make us to be the
[1:32:30] right partaker in you we love you we
[1:32:33] thank you in Jesus name Amen let's go to
[1:32:39] first Corinthians 11:23 we have received
[1:32:43] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:32:45] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:32:49] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:32:50] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:32:53] brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:32:56] body which is broken for that you this
[1:32:59] do in remembrance of me after the same
[1:33:02] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:33:04] supped saying this cup is the New
[1:33:06] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:33:10] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:33:13] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:33:15] this cup you do shew the Lord's death
[1:33:17] till he come or for whosoever shall eat
[1:33:20] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:33:23] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:33:25] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:33:28] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:33:30] that bread and drink of that Cup where
[1:33:33] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:33:34] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:33:37] not discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:33:41] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:33:43] in many sleep where we would judge
[1:33:46] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:33:49] when we are judged we're chasing to the
[1:33:52] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:33:54] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:33:56] when you come together to eat tarry one
[1:33:59] for another and if any man hunger
[1:34:02] let him eat at home and you come out
[1:34:05] together into condemnation the rest will
[1:34:07] have said in order when I
[1:34:09] what a solemn time what an opportunity
[1:34:12] that we can come to a place to where we
[1:34:16] can participate take a part in this part
[1:34:22] of it's been going on for 2,000 years
[1:34:25] we call it the communion thank God for
[1:34:29] the truth of his word let's just own
[1:34:33] through it in the communion said he took
[1:34:36] bread and blessed it father we ask you
[1:34:38] to just press this bread as we Lord
[1:34:40] father partake of it we come to a point
[1:34:44] of realizing that we know it's not the
[1:34:46] blood it's not the body and all those
[1:34:49] things that we do today
[1:34:50] but we know for sure did it
[1:34:52] representative we just ask you to help
[1:34:54] us Lord that you sanctify this bread in
[1:34:58] that way you would sanctify the
[1:34:59] partakers that we may all be together is
[1:35:02] warning you this
[1:35:03] forgive our sins and lead us by thy
[1:35:05] grace and your love is sufficient for
[1:35:08] all times in Jesus name
[1:35:19] we won't we don't understand in this
[1:35:21] world and it's hard to comprehend the
[1:35:24] different things that God has done for
[1:35:27] us and all did you know what there'll be
[1:35:29] a date and we'll have an opportunity to
[1:35:32] be able to just maybe sit down for a
[1:35:35] little while and let him explain it
[1:35:37] together I'm looking forward today I've
[1:35:41] always that I've never never thought
[1:35:44] that you know that we'd go up there I
[1:35:46] just sit down and play harps cuz I'm not
[1:35:49] too good at musical instruments so I'd
[1:35:52] be having a lot of trouble but I just
[1:35:55] sit down with the Lord for a little
[1:35:57] while and just get an opportunity to be
[1:36:00] able to fellowship around the things
[1:36:03] that we did not understand and do not
[1:36:06] understand and will not understand why
[1:36:08] we're here in this world but we'll bring
[1:36:10] it to a place that will have an
[1:36:13] understanding about what these things
[1:36:15] mean why done this I've done that the
[1:36:20] Prophet one day preaching the message
[1:36:22] you know talking about the two loaves of
[1:36:24] bread and he said that that rabbi he
[1:36:30] said he'd never seen what's that mean
[1:36:32] there's times in God's Word it's going
[1:36:37] to be a wonderful opportunity father we
[1:36:40] thank you for this one and it's going
[1:36:41] through the process now and Lord and we
[1:36:44] protect our vision represents your blood
[1:36:46] for each and every one of us we know
[1:36:48] physically really eat them you piece of
[1:36:50] bread will drink a little wine it'll
[1:36:52] turn into blood cells in our body for us
[1:36:55] to grow by but we prayed that you would
[1:36:57] help us to grow by you and the opening
[1:36:59] of your word the understanding to where

[1:37:03] together in you
