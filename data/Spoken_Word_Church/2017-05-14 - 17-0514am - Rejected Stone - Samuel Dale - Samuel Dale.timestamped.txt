[8:59] going to visitor folks and different
[9:01] times Lord and we ask you to just bless
[9:04] each one have your way with all of us
[9:06] and guide us in Jesus name Amen
[9:13] we're going to ask for verse 9 if we
[9:19] this day
[9:20] be examined of the good deed done to the
[9:22] impotent man by what means he has made
[9:26] whole
[9:27] be it known unto you all into all the
[9:31] people of Israel that by the name of
[9:33] Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you
[9:36] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[9:39] even by him that this man standing here
[9:42] before you oh this is the stone which
[9:46] was set at nought of you builders which
[9:47] has become the head of the corner
[9:50] neither is there salvation in any other
[9:53] for there is none other name under
[9:55] heaven given among men whereby we must
[9:59] be saved you may be seated
[10:01] Lord that is blessing for the reading of
[10:04] the word now I know it means what it's
[10:07] saying and it's right but you know
[10:10] sometimes you look at the scripture you
[10:12] know but if you look at that or think
[10:14] about that life verse it says that where
[10:19] there is none other name under heaven
[10:21] given among men whereby we must be saved
[10:24] in other words there is no name for
[10:27] nowhere under heaven hurt that can save
[10:31] you or have anything to do with your
[10:33] salvation except the name of the Lord
[10:36] Jesus Christ all right so get that
[10:38] thought in your mind and you'll
[10:41] understand all right now just background
[10:43] a point this is just after the Holy
[10:48] Ghost falling on the people in the upper
[10:50] room you know and the things that are
[10:52] happening and you come down to chapter
[10:54] that's two and you come down to chapter
[10:56] three and you'll find this is the first
[10:59] miracle was the healing this recorded
[11:02] other disciples you know where Peter
[11:04] named the man laying at the gate you
[11:06] know I've been lying from his mother's
[11:08] womb and he said you know arms of them
[11:12] and and Peter them said you know silver
[11:15] and gold have I none but in the name of
[11:16] Jesus Christ rise up and walk it was the
[11:19] first miracle that took place when I in
[11:23] it so odd that you could take a miracle
[11:26] that even it's recorded on through 2 3
[11:30] or 3 & 4 that
[11:33] I couldn't say anything because the
[11:36] demand was standing there in other words
[11:38] they knew about it the fries and all
[11:40] knew this man had been coming and
[11:42] sitting there daily asking arm so it
[11:46] wasn't a secret thing but what about
[11:48] when you wind up in a man that's been
[11:50] lame all of his life and you see him out
[11:54] there jumping up and down and running
[11:55] all over the place and all like that and
[11:59] then you've questioned the people that
[12:03] that would happen by you know in that
[12:07] odd
[12:07] could we be that away no no no we
[12:12] couldn't
[12:13] well that's kind of the thought today
[12:15] could we fit in a category that maybe
[12:22] not knowingly but be like them you know
[12:24] they were not bad people they were great
[12:26] people they were all the priests and the
[12:29] different things you know and they lived
[12:31] it free Stalin lived in the temple and
[12:33] went to church every day and all of the
[12:36] great things that they were but when a
[12:39] man gets healed then the question about
[12:41] it and then turn around and warned you
[12:44] not to preach the more that night
[12:45] because they did that was you that got
[12:47] on over into the fourth chapter in other
[12:50] words they probably beat him in fact a
[12:52] figure they got by with it but they
[12:54] threatened them a couple of times and
[12:56] you know they told them not to do it and
[12:58] Peter get something he says well we
[13:00] don't know where to obey your obey God
[13:01] said but we're not worried about it
[13:03] we're going to go tell everybody what
[13:05] happened so they took him back and they
[13:06] warned him again what about somebody
[13:08] getting healed and yet because it's none
[13:13] of your group it's none of your little
[13:17] clique your little thing I don't know
[13:20] where the helper well I like what the
[13:23] Bible said the man was dying he was over
[13:25] 40 in other words they'd been there for
[13:28] 40 years setting out to her nearly and
[13:30] nobody could argue the point but yet
[13:33] they wanted to argue the point you know
[13:36] they want to argue with them about this
[13:38] so just think about it now and as it did
[13:44] when it come to the point
[13:46] and they begin to be questioned that's
[13:48] when Peter and then picked up and what
[13:50] we read all right and they said all
[13:54] right now you want to know how this
[13:59] happened
[13:59] did we tell you the one you crucified
[14:06] that he now has given to the church this
[14:14] power this thing's come on in let's see
[14:18] did you see our visitors with us you
[14:21] know sitting and doing that in the name
[14:24] of Jesus Christ said we tell you this is
[14:29] what happened the Lord done these things
[14:32] and what about a group of people that's
[14:36] always amazed me no matter whether it
[14:39] would be after I come into messages we
[14:41] call it or back when we was in the
[14:43] Baptist's always wondered what people
[14:46] could hate somebody for healing the sick
[14:48] raising the dead casting out Devils
[14:51] and they couldn't argue about it I'm
[14:55] talking about in the ministry of Jesus
[14:56] Christ right then when that minister of
[15:00] Jesus Christ came over into the church
[15:03] and they were doing the same things the
[15:08] same people were ridiculing them and
[15:16] telling them not to preach no more I can
[15:19] tell nobody about these healings and I
[15:23] remember the one man that was blind and
[15:25] lord jesus healed you no no they got
[15:29] onto it and he even is family just about
[15:34] backed away from him you know the mom
[15:35] and daddy come they're afraid to say
[15:37] anything because they did that's going
[15:39] to get onto them and throw them out of
[15:41] the church for healing now when I'm
[15:47] talking about not talking about
[15:48] salvation you're talking about natural
[15:51] healings and miracles that took place
[15:55] that cannot be questioned by anyone
[15:58] because the people
[16:00] dier could you fit in that category
[16:05] could we fit in that category it's
[16:09] because it doesn't come to our little
[16:11] group our ranks or our dollars you know
[16:17] could it be that we would turn against
[16:20] the real truth oh no well you know what
[16:25] if you to ask them that they just said
[16:27] that to read to have our visitors with
[16:29] us and we always say to you here when
[16:32] you come one time your visitor and we
[16:34] say welcome to you come two times you're
[16:37] part of us because we don't have
[16:38] anything here to join anything we just
[16:41] part of the body of Christ so we say to
[16:43] you welcome just you know I mean my
[16:47] point is if it happened again you know
[16:57] what would be the things that we would
[16:59] say and do
[17:04] you had the man that was healed you
[17:09] lamed are he was healed he was up
[17:14] running all over the place and everybody
[17:15] knew it and then you take the people in
[17:19] and ask them how that happened not the
[17:24] one who learn right not to learn how it
[17:30] happened but to try to set you up will
[17:36] they be something with it just because
[17:39] you don't believe the way that people
[17:42] believe does that give you a right to
[17:45] even turn down the things God does well
[17:55] I just don't believe that really helping
[17:57] you know I don't know well let's see you
[18:00] do it that's what the disciples to say
[18:04] back to when did even the man we tell
[18:08] them I want to go there minute ago that
[18:10] his mom and daddy wouldn't say but he
[18:12] told him he said now
[18:14] you come on and tell me that he's ever
[18:16] been recorded that a man was blind he
[18:19] can see and said then this breaking it
[18:22] down in plain language today and saying
[18:24] now let's see where you done it but yet
[18:30] they didn't believe it why why would you
[18:37] think that way what would be in the
[18:41] human mind to turn down what could not
[18:46] be questioned but yet you don't agree
[18:51] with it could we be in the same category
[18:55] or go see according to the scriptures
[19:01] that we read when they come to the
[19:09] questioning the disciples gave their
[19:13] answer they replied back and they said
[19:20] we want you to know this man is whole
[19:28] because you crucified the very lord of
[19:34] glory and yet he turned as I said a
[19:38] minute ago he turned to the church and
[19:41] gave the church the power to heal the
[19:46] sick cast out Devils said in other words
[19:50] Peter would be saying it watch the
[19:53] problem why are you so upset let's see
[19:59] you do it
[20:02] well that didn't stop anything did it
[20:06] but I liked where the disciples did it
[20:09] to they put it to the point you know
[20:12] saying it can't be questioned the man
[20:18] standing here
[20:21] and you can't question that happening we
[20:27] said we're not telling you just a story
[20:31] we're not just making up something
[20:35] saying well we're standing here and we
[20:36] can't prove it to you
[20:38] they went back in the scriptures what
[20:45] about taking it back into the scriptures
[20:47] to the scribes and the Pharisees will
[20:50] say it - that way - where you'll follow
[20:52] - were because that's the learned that
[20:55] was the high priest was are you reading
[20:59] in the 3rd chapter you'll find the
[21:02] priest was there you'll find all of them
[21:04] was dire all their kinfolks as has the
[21:08] high priest and things was dire it
[21:12] wasn't something done in the corner that
[21:13] nobody didn't know about it it brought
[21:16] the attention of all of those people to
[21:18] come to them and when they were asked
[21:21] about it Peter said ok here he stands
[21:25] you can't argue but he said don't you
[21:35] remember the scriptures and surely it
[21:41] hurt their little feelings when he said
[21:43] this one that's healed this man said you
[21:49] crucified Him
[21:56] and as I was always a Citroen it's
[21:59] always been in my mind to think of what
[22:01] wrong did Jesus do that a ver ever gave
[22:06] man the right to do any of the things he
[22:09] done one thing any one act of the life
[22:20] of Jesus Christ where would it justify
[22:24] for you to kill him all he died was done
[22:29] good healed a sec said two people got
[22:35] him off a well fire and all of that why
[22:44] would you want to kill somebody but
[22:48] seeing like I said now not even the fact
[22:51] that they could prove this had happened
[22:55] that's a great thing
[22:57] Jordan think about but the fact that
[23:00] Peter would turn in and turn it to the
[23:03] word and say this man you crucified said
[23:11] by his name this man stands hold before
[23:16] you and said this was folk oven the word
[23:25] this was spoken you reason to turn these
[23:28] scriptures this was poke up in the word
[23:35] this is the stone which was set at
[23:38] nought of you builders which is become
[23:41] the head of the corner
[23:44] you wouldn't something nut are you
[23:48] following me when you can lay down the
[23:51] healing you can lay down the miracles
[23:53] you can lay down the things that
[23:54] happened that man could not question and
[24:01] yet people would turn against it
[24:05] one
[24:08] what would make mankind to be that way
[24:11] it would turn against the very things
[24:13] that could be proved not to be able to
[24:17] question it but then Peter turning back
[24:24] to them and said the scripture said you
[24:28] would do this the scripture is verified
[24:34] if you would do this like this and said
[24:41] why don't you believe it you know that
[24:45] Jesus in his ministry spoke of these
[24:50] things just in his ministry let alone
[24:52] the reading we'll get to that to Psalms
[24:54] in a minute to read worse there in the
[24:55] scripture but I want to approach it this
[24:58] way see the Lord Jesus when he was here
[25:02] what did he have to say about these
[25:05] people and their ways go ahead and pull
[25:07] up number 1 we go to Matthew 21 let's
[25:14] just read some scriptures but I like for
[25:17] things to be in Word it's great to have
[25:20] all kind of physical proof but what
[25:24] about going to the word with it then it
[25:27] can't be questioned at all in the mouth
[25:29] of two or three witnesses let everything
[25:30] be established Matthew 21 42 44 jesus
[25:36] saith unto them did you never read in
[25:39] the scriptures the stone which the
[25:44] builders rejected and then with the
[25:50] builders them and where Jesus said this
[25:55] is already spoke of in the word that
[25:57] you're doing what the word says you're
[25:59] going to do you realize that's what they
[26:02] were exactly doing they were fulfilling
[26:03] the scriptures the stone which the
[26:06] builders rejected the same is become the
[26:09] head of the corner this is the Lord's
[26:13] doing I like this part here because it
[26:16] listed in each gospel Matthew
[26:20] listen listen Matthew Mark and Luke and
[26:23] each one of them says because it's
[26:25] picking it up for the Old Testament and
[26:27] it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I
[26:34] say unto you and because of what you're
[26:40] doing because of you rejecting me as the
[26:47] Messiah is that what he's saying so I'm
[26:51] showing you this in the scripture if you
[26:54] do it and said look at you so what's
[27:00] going to happen to you because that
[27:04] you've rejected the head of the corner
[27:11] the stone therefore I say unto you the
[27:17] kingdom of God shall be taken from you
[27:21] who's he talking to the Jews and given
[27:27] to a nation bringing forth the fruits
[27:29] thereof them that would be given to the
[27:31] Gentile you read all the scripture and
[27:35] whosoever shall fall on this stone shall
[27:39] be broken we don't whomsoever it shall
[27:41] fall it will grind him to powder
[27:44] what about standing and telling the
[27:47] greatest religious leaders that had ever
[27:50] been did you're rejecting me
[27:55] as your Messiah you declare that he is
[28:05] to come by the scriptures and show me
[28:08] word of the word fire phrase in
[28:09] Scripture Jesus was saying to him show
[28:12] me work
[28:13] I haven't fulfilled the Scriptures they
[28:19] had not one thing that could bring
[28:22] against him
[28:24] was it Herod he's I find nothing Paulo I
[28:31] find nothing
[28:33] against this man that was a heathen that
[28:39] didn't give a hoot about cutting a man's
[28:41] throat is we we said in plain language
[28:45] only interested in would stopping an
[28:48] insurrection we said how to find nothing
[28:52] in history but what about telling those
[28:58] people so now because you've done this
[29:01] and rejected me the kingdom is going to
[29:08] be taken from you and given to a people
[29:12] you go over the other writings that said
[29:14] even go to a nation that was not even
[29:17] the nation when we're going to be giving
[29:18] to the Gentiles
[29:23] you know what to get your feelings hurt
[29:26] so bad until they're ready to kill the
[29:27] man that is said that right can we do
[29:32] that because it doesn't agree with every
[29:34] little thing that we thinks about look
[29:40] at mark basically the same type of
[29:43] scriptures but just look at it mark 12
[29:47] caught it want you to think of these
[29:48] scriptures why shield are for the lord
[29:52] of the vineyard same situation he's
[29:55] talking about what's happening and he's
[29:57] come to Union Gundy same and what shall
[30:00] therefore the lord of the vineyard do
[30:03] you'll come and destroy the husbandmen
[30:06] and give the vineyard unto others and
[30:09] have you not read this scripture the
[30:16] stone which the builders rejected has
[30:19] become the head of the corner this is
[30:25] the Lord's doing this marvelous and I'm
[30:32] not being able as I keep pointing out to
[30:35] bring any accusation against him
[30:43] he said well know what about you well
[30:44] you bring one accusation detective use
[30:48] they never said a thing when Jesus
[30:52] planted a rope together made it wheel
[30:55] and drove out of the temple there's no
[30:58] record they ever tried to bring that
[31:01] charge against him because they knew
[31:06] they were wrong they were in start doing
[31:13] the wrong things with the selling of the
[31:16] animals when all right if they'd have
[31:17] brought him outside done him away out
[31:19] all kind of that was legal they never
[31:23] said a word
[31:24] looks like that would be one thing that
[31:27] you could bring against him well you got
[31:29] mad and you beat him out they knew then
[31:33] what he was doing right are you
[31:38] following me they had not one thing to
[31:40] be able to bring against him well why
[31:46] would you turn him down go ahead number
[31:51] three Luke 20 verifies - he shall come
[31:56] and destroy these husbandmen and he'll
[31:59] give the vineyard to others and when
[32:03] they heard it they said god forbid and
[32:11] he beheld them and said what is this
[32:15] then that is written that can't be done
[32:21] that you can't take it away from us in
[32:27] Jesus is what is this that's really make
[32:33] sure Lee knew what was written right I
[32:35] said he beheld them and said what is
[32:38] this then that is written the stone
[32:40] which the builders rejected the same is
[32:43] become the head of the corner my point
[32:53] is could it happen again in you and I
[33:02] because it never came our way because it
[33:06] never came from our group if Jesus would
[33:12] have come as a Pharisee and acted like a
[33:14] fire seasoned unlike the Pharisees would
[33:16] have accepted it right if he become a
[33:20] coming to Sadducees
[33:22] should've been in that way they would
[33:25] have accepted him but when he came not
[33:27] belonging to anything remember he didn't
[33:33] blow anything he was every time he was
[33:37] either Almighty God or the whole
[33:40] religious world is in a chaos because of
[33:46] whether it's the truth or not all right
[33:50] forgive me no shyness who gets leading
[33:55] yes we throat I hate to do this but it's
[34:00] either that or quit so you put up with
[34:03] not liking me doing that that's all but
[34:08] think about it now the Lord Jesus
[34:13] referring to the scriptures right and
[34:22] telling them what the scriptures had to
[34:25] say about now let's read that scripture
[34:28] that go ahead to number 5 let's read the
[34:30] scripture that he's referring to and
[34:32] read the scripture that Peter was
[34:34] referring to let's go back in the Old
[34:37] Testament let's pick up these things
[34:44] remember now the first he's supposed to
[34:46] know description look what he says in
[34:51] Isaiah 28:16
[34:52] therefore thus saith the Lord God behold
[34:55] I lay in Zion for a foundation or stone
[35:01] a tried stone
[35:03] a precious cornerstone a sure foundation
[35:08] he that believeth shall not make way
[35:12] make haste he's referring back okay
[35:16] let's go one more let's go to Psalms
[35:19] this is the scripture the Lord Jesus was
[35:22] referring back to let's go into Sean's
[35:25] now I'm going to find it
[35:28] anyhow you got it wrong
[35:32] eight one eighteen I will praise thee
[35:36] for thou has heard me and art become my
[35:39] salvation the stone which the builders
[35:42] refused is become the headstone of the
[35:47] corner ours again this is the Lord's
[35:51] doing it's marvelous in our eyes the
[35:56] stone which the builders with use see in
[35:58] other words the Lord Jesus wasn't this
[36:00] is what I'm saying about Peter it wasn't
[36:03] just the fact of saying the Lord Jesus
[36:05] didn't just come out and say well look
[36:07] what's happened let's see you do it he
[36:12] could have easily said that to him right
[36:15] he did in cases where he said who do you
[36:18] cast him out by what I mean he could
[36:21] have just ever service said look you get
[36:25] up and do this no he was good but he
[36:31] wanted to see the scripture spoke of
[36:35] this coming stone and that he'd be the
[36:43] chief Cornerstone when it was finished
[36:46] well what about turning that down what
[36:53] about turning him down he said what are
[36:57] you getting - I'm getting - one thing is
[37:00] there any way you could question the
[37:03] fact of whether or not God is real well
[37:08] I ain't never seen him glory your
[37:10] smaller thank you that's about as dumb
[37:13] as excuses you could get just say you
[37:16] ain't never seen it
[37:17] I thought thought we was to believe to
[37:22] see not see to believe
[37:25] run all right we see what would be your
[37:29] excuse today by not accepting God's Word
[37:36] what would be your arguments are your
[37:40] thoughts well you don't belong to our
[37:42] group what does it matter that's why we
[37:49] don't belong to any group sure well the
[37:52] following yes we follow we do but we
[37:55] don't belong to any organization or
[37:58] anything
[37:58] why not arguing with nobody about
[38:02] anything it's just her business I just
[38:05] chose to be that way okay all right now
[38:09] watch then knowing that the Lord Jesus
[38:12] Christ was in prophecy all the way
[38:15] through the Old Testament to come into
[38:17] being right trying to run down to where
[38:20] we are and that in all of that he was
[38:24] the fulfillment of all the scriptures
[38:26] and he could say even show me where I've
[38:31] sinned and they couldn't bring a case
[38:34] against him of sin oh yeah they had
[38:37] rumors but they wouldn't stand before
[38:40] him they had rumors running around yell
[38:43] he's illegitimate child he's just that
[38:45] or the other but they were smart enough
[38:50] not to bring those things out I like it
[38:53] that way I'm a human being I'm not
[38:56] people say oh you're too smart you're
[38:58] too intelligent
[38:59] you know intelligence is good if you use
[39:01] it correctly right I three not like to
[39:06] read about the Apostle Paul I like to
[39:09] follow his readings you know why he's
[39:13] smart you remember the time though they
[39:16] was going to kill him or whatever beat
[39:18] him up he just turned around he said now
[39:21] I'm over here you group I believe this
[39:23] with you here in the resurrection and
[39:25] I'm over here with this group and I
[39:27] believe this over here and he got into
[39:30] fighting with
[39:31] try to read the book of Acts and he just
[39:33] walks out I think anybody ought to be
[39:39] smart not the wisdom of man but the
[39:44] wisdom of God was if I will say wise as
[39:47] a serpent harmless of the death we said
[39:52] what are you getting at I'm getting to
[39:53] the point of why in the world mankind
[39:55] will not believe even though the proofs
[39:59] the thing unquestionable signs but why
[40:11] won't we believe it and then put our car
[40:15] with us into that point and say well who
[40:17] is this then who is this stone that was
[40:25] promised to come who is this branch as
[40:29] the Bible says to come out of the son of
[40:31] David who is this fulfillment of all the
[40:35] scriptures that he's Jesus Christ the
[40:42] chief Cornerstone he's the stone that
[40:46] was promised to come do we still believe
[40:52] that he promised today to come and do
[40:54] what he's doing go ahead go to number
[40:57] six
[40:57] go to Ephesians 2 coming down to you 9
[41:03] and therefore you are no more strangers
[41:06] and foreigners but fellow-citizens with
[41:09] the Saints and of the household of faith
[41:13] now that should be the people I'm
[41:15] talking to today shouldn't be any
[41:17] problem because you should be not
[41:19] strangers or strange language or
[41:23] wordings we're using to talk about plain
[41:27] old simple language God promised in his
[41:32] word then he would send the Messiah he
[41:36] would come and what would happen to him
[41:38] and he'd be the stone that the builders
[41:42] would reject
[41:47] and when they got here they done exactly
[41:50] what he said they'd do it rejected but
[41:53] think about it we're not out to some
[41:56] word that we don't know the truth we
[41:59] should know the truth
[42:01] I thought it was full set us free so
[42:04] look now they're far you know more
[42:06] strangers and foreigners but
[42:07] fellow-citizens with the Saints and of
[42:09] the household of God okay and I've built
[42:13] what upon the foundation of the apostles
[42:17] and prophets and what is that foundation
[42:23] of the apostles and prophets
[42:24] what were they bringing Jesus Christ
[42:29] Himself being the chief Cornerstone the
[42:35] one that was disallowed the one that was
[42:39] rejected but why would you reject him
[42:50] remember this is speaking to the
[42:53] Ephesians telling them who they are look
[42:58] what he says to the Romans
[43:00] this apostle paul romans 9 and as isaiah
[43:11] said before except the Lord of Sabaoth
[43:16] had left us a seed we had been and
[43:19] sivanna shot him and made like under
[43:21] Kamara what shall we say then the two
[43:25] gentile us remember what we're saying
[43:28] want to go Jesus said what's going to
[43:31] happen because of these is turning down
[43:33] this stone he said you're going to be
[43:37] cut off is that what we were doing want
[43:39] to go you're going to be rejected and
[43:42] the Gentiles is going to be brought in
[43:44] now that Gentile was a dog to the Jews
[43:47] right so that's a bad thing for them to
[43:50] be doing but look what he said what
[43:52] shall we say then that the Gentiles
[43:55] which followed not after
[43:58] in other words live like the devil wheel
[43:59] carrying clubs on the back with nothing
[44:01] we were you know it wasn't something
[44:02] with great religious people we just
[44:04] Gentiles we were just either ah is that
[44:07] what he's saying that followed not after
[44:11] in his word
[44:13] it wasn't concerned but look what
[44:17] they've done they've attained to
[44:18] righteousness
[44:22] how come or how even the righteousness
[44:27] which is a faith revelation now we're
[44:34] getting to the point of seeing that
[44:38] those use when Jesus were talking about
[44:44] the stone they begin to understand when
[44:53] he said the King I'm going to be taken
[44:55] from you and given to another because of
[44:58] what you do they begin to understand and
[45:07] they got upset
[45:09] Paul carries this over to the Romans
[45:12] which is in the New Testament and he's
[45:16] speaking to the Jews trying to get them
[45:21] because he was a Jew right Paul he said
[45:25] I always I did we have cast away from my
[45:26] people he was trying his best to get
[45:30] them to see the truth not at what he
[45:36] didn't wasn't necessarily in the book of
[45:38] Romans trying to get them to see what
[45:40] the Jews done to Jesus what he was
[45:48] trying to get them to see what they were
[45:49] doing
[45:51] right these Romans knew what the Jews
[45:57] had done they crucified Jesus Christ so
[46:02] he wasn't trying to get them to see that
[46:04] he's trying to get them to see what they
[46:06] were doing
[46:10] how the Gentiles which were total
[46:14] outcasts no promises right few little
[46:19] types and shatters throughout the Old
[46:20] Testament the Gentiles that accepted
[46:25] Jesus Christ and become the people of
[46:31] God but now he's talking to them he's
[46:39] talking to Christians you have a
[46:43] Christian can't turn down God be careful
[46:50] be careful with that statement yeah but
[46:55] I've got the Bible God won't let me peel
[46:57] off but not B but you might have to take
[46:59] you out seen to get rid of you right is
[47:03] that also in the word so now we're
[47:07] trying to get down to where we're at
[47:09] right so we stop in with the Romans to
[47:11] see what Paul is saying to them see then
[47:14] we get down to where we're at okay
[47:16] listen and Isaiah which is really Isaiah
[47:20] you know the word extent you coming down
[47:23] what shall we say then that the Gentiles
[47:27] which followed not after righteousness
[47:29] no lineages no nothing to get us here
[47:32] have obtained of the righteousness even
[47:35] the righteousness which is of faith
[47:40] Abraham called the father of faith right
[47:43] because it was Abraham's believing faith
[47:48] believing I want but Israel did God give
[47:58] our Israel's of law you give it to them
[48:06] it regardless what you want to argue
[48:08] about what happened in between this end
[48:10] here Israel received the law right the
[48:12] Oracles came to Israel the law the Word
[48:15] of God came to
[48:16] okay look but Israel which followed
[48:18] after the law of righteousness there was
[48:24] not a thing that they could save Paul
[48:27] said a hebrew of the hebrew of this that
[48:30] everybody's on he said blameless
[48:32] considering the law the high priest if i
[48:36] could bring one mark against the high
[48:37] priest and kill him right he kept the
[48:42] law that close you realize that who
[48:45] jesus was talking to those that were not
[48:47] guilty of breaking any laws
[48:49] did he condemn them for breaking the
[48:51] laws or did he condemn them for what
[48:54] we're reading right here but Israel
[48:59] which followed after the law
[49:00] righteousness hath not obtained to the
[49:02] law Roger
[49:05] Israel kept the law to the letter is
[49:10] that what Paul's saying why didn't God
[49:12] save them he gave them the law they kept
[49:21] the law why the were there not Rochester
[49:28] righteousness means to be right or the
[49:30] factor act to being right it's not a
[49:33] great big word that you put out it's
[49:34] really just a state or fact of being
[49:36] rocked that's the best definition of
[49:39] righteousness because you can try to
[49:40] figure out I didn't do this and I didn't
[49:42] do that I did do this and God's
[49:44] righteous they got to do with it
[49:46] it's the factor state of being right so
[49:51] now look
[49:52] but Israel which followed after the law
[49:55] of righteousness had not obtained into
[49:57] the law Roger
[49:58] wherefore wherefore is a word that can
[50:00] be called why word for word are for just
[50:03] for in other words just said why why is
[50:07] it that Israel followed after the law of
[50:09] righteousness but never attained to that
[50:11] why why did they not get it the answer
[50:19] is it because they sought it not by
[50:21] faith
[50:26] but is it were by the work to the law
[50:32] doing and not doing what the law says
[50:37] right what do they wind up doing but as
[50:44] it were by the works of the law they
[50:46] tried to keep the law to the letter for
[50:50] they stumbled at that stumbling-stone
[50:58] stumbled at the students tongue now how
[51:01] you going to stumble at the stumbling
[51:02] stone when you're doing exactly what God
[51:04] says for you to do and not do
[51:08] are you following me trying to get down
[51:11] to where we are now because we're not
[51:13] talking about keeping the law a
[51:17] born-again Christian is the only one
[51:19] that can keep the law you want to
[51:24] discuss that point a born-again
[51:27] Christian is only one that can keep the
[51:28] law that's why Paul said the things I
[51:32] thought was right I found to be no wrong
[51:35] he said then I got born again I found
[51:38] out what it was he said now I live by
[51:41] faith not by keeping the law he said
[51:46] well you don't believe in keeping the
[51:47] law under if you're a born-again
[51:50] Christian your underwear about it right
[51:53] now if you born-again Christian you're
[51:56] going to do what the law says right come
[52:00] on
[52:02] see they sought it not by faith but as
[52:09] it were by the works of the law where
[52:14] they stumbled at the stumbling stone
[52:18] now could we sit in our self-righteous
[52:23] little estate that's where second I live
[52:31] a good life
[52:34] I don't drink I don't smoke I don't chew
[52:37] I don't run around with women I don't do
[52:39] all the things I live a good life well
[52:42] praise God Alcoholics Anonymous would
[52:45] like to see you because you'd make them
[52:46] a good neighbor but where's that going
[52:52] to save you
[52:53] there's no salvation in whether you keep
[52:56] the law or not that's what Paul is
[52:59] explaining it's got to come by faith so
[53:01] that's where we're going to get it right
[53:04] for they stumbled at the stumbling stone
[53:09] now he's using naturally as really they
[53:12] stumbled after stumbling but he's really
[53:13] telling them you're right now stumbling
[53:15] at the stumbling stumble because you're
[53:19] not seeing it by faith you're trying to
[53:22] do it by some kind of words you're still
[53:24] trying to lean to some words as your
[53:26] salvation works is supposed to be an
[53:30] expression of salvation works is not
[53:33] salvation is the expression of an inward
[53:35] life to come outward right look
[53:43] now you're going to stumble at the stone
[53:46] the stone as it is written behold I lay
[53:49] in Zion or stumbling stone and rock of
[53:52] the sinners and whosoever believeth on
[53:54] him shall not be ashamed then we're
[53:58] talking about believing he's not talking
[54:01] about keeping it actually talking to
[54:05] them that are trying to keep it it's
[54:08] wonderful to be a good neighbor but
[54:12] there's no salvation in it but you know
[54:15] what they've done away with hell you
[54:16] notice that because there's nobody going
[54:18] our anymore because everybody's got some
[54:20] little good thing and you go there and
[54:22] the preacher gets up and he says I know
[54:23] this brother has been a bad guy and he's
[54:25] honest but I saw him place he paved the
[54:28] parking lot in the church over there so
[54:30] I know he's in heaven to bless it oh
[54:31] brother
[54:32] am i right nobody's going to hell no
[54:36] more they just going to do away with he
[54:39] that's silly I call you leave so is it
[54:42] silly to think you got some kind of
[54:43] works which you can make yourself better
[54:47] if silly do you think that you done are
[54:49] getting new don't you want to slit right
[54:52] no oh you funny preacher you mean you
[54:57] telecom guys you don't want to let us
[54:58] know once you get born again we won't
[55:03] worry about living right right you know
[55:07] what I drink all the alcohol I want to I
[55:10] just won't call it cigarettes or I lie
[55:12] cheat and steal and curse now all I want
[55:15] to you know what because the thing that
[55:17] used to make me do it is gone see that's
[55:23] Christianity that's not works of the law
[55:25] that's salvation now listen go ahead
[55:36] let's get this one more go ahead to
[55:39] first Peter number eight we'll get this
[55:42] and just take a little bit up and go
[55:46] look what Peter says unto use R for
[55:50] which believe he's precious but to them
[55:57] which be disobedient we think of
[56:02] disobedience as being somebody mean
[56:04] arrogant and hateful and always doing
[56:07] wrong then Pharisee stood right before
[56:10] the Lord Jesus and he never condemned
[56:13] them whatsoever because he knew they
[56:16] were living the law to the letter show
[56:18] me where he ever said a word Dukakis or
[56:21] any of them about something wrong they
[56:22] were doing they were good people look
[56:31] what he says here don't you use our for
[56:36] which believe he's precious but it was
[56:38] then which be disobedient and watch this
[56:41] scripture the stone which the builders
[56:43] just allowed the same is laid ahead of
[56:45] the corner now how can it be made ahead
[56:48] of the corner and what you're saying but
[56:51] under you which be disobedient as he the
[56:55] head of the disobedient
[56:58] Regis picture remember he's the head of
[57:05] a whole thing he doesn't matter whether
[57:09] it be a sinner or saint he's the head
[57:13] and we big disobedient claim to be
[57:17] married to him he's still the head
[57:20] because he created you he brought you
[57:24] into being and we're disobedient look
[57:29] what he says the same as made the head
[57:33] of the corner and the stone of stumbling
[57:38] I like on that tour that you you know
[57:42] the Bible talks about trying to find the
[57:44] stone
[57:45] have you ever thought about it this way
[57:47] you know you got a football field what
[57:49] is it 100 yards long and 50 wide or
[57:51] whatever it is something like that I
[57:53] think it's 100 anyway long and you're
[57:57] looking for a rock and there's one rock
[58:00] laying in the middle of the football
[58:02] field and you stumble over it trying to
[58:07] find it now that's about as dumb as you
[58:11] can get right even a blind man wouldn't
[58:13] work that way goes at least blind man be
[58:17] down on the ground hunting park crawling
[58:18] around trying to feel Park right are you
[58:21] following me you stumble it the truth
[58:32] it's a stone of stumbling and a rock of
[58:35] offense to who even to them which
[58:39] stumble what at the word now your
[58:48] righteousness sometimes is coming back
[58:50] from a book of rules to fit into a
[58:54] revelation of Jesus Christ you're not a
[59:00] Christian because you don't do things or
[59:02] do you ride you're a Christian if you're
[59:06] born again see they stumble that the
[59:10] word
[59:11] being disobedient were unto also they
[59:14] were appointed now those Pharisees back
[59:18] it on forward around stumbling at the
[59:20] word dire stood the word before them
[59:27] performing all the words said he would
[59:29] do yes they stumbled over that what was
[59:35] their stumbling now quote the prophet
[59:40] this way I think Leslie birkland he said
[59:42] it was hard to get those Pharisees to
[59:44] realize they were sinners where he could
[59:49] die for their sins right was Jesus
[59:55] trying to get the fire season all the
[59:56] little better and what's better couldn't
[1:00:00] get they were not breaking the law they
[1:00:03] were living the law that was what they
[1:00:05] thought their salvation was and that was
[1:00:08] right until Jesus came and when he came
[1:00:16] he came to fulfill the stumbling stone
[1:00:21] the one they'd stumble over what's the
[1:00:25] greatest stumbling you could think about
[1:00:27] the children of Israel doing he said
[1:00:31] well they killed it that's good I mean
[1:00:35] that's top-notch that's good but you
[1:00:38] know what to me is the greatest
[1:00:39] stumbling that we could ever do anyone
[1:00:44] could ever do was to it refused to
[1:00:49] accept Jesus Christ as their Savior do
[1:00:56] you see where I'm going not to what you
[1:00:58] think I'm going to stumbling in a
[1:01:00] crucifixion sure that's great that's in
[1:01:04] there they crucified Him they done hello
[1:01:06] son but you know what he died for cos
[1:01:13] just as much as he did Peter he died for
[1:01:18] Judas as much as he died for John
[1:01:25] Judis where he messed up was what come
[1:01:32] on I'm not one of these trying to make
[1:01:33] this new modern version of Judas no I'm
[1:01:35] just plain and honest with the scripture
[1:01:37] Judas just done what a human mortal
[1:01:39] would do Peter denied the Lord Jesus and
[1:01:45] cursed after denying in three times who
[1:01:48] was the worst sinner to stand there is
[1:01:50] that the Bible was Judas any worse than
[1:01:55] anybody else
[1:01:57] no his only problem was what he didn't
[1:02:00] make it to upper room yeah but I don't
[1:02:05] believe that because I believe he was a
[1:02:07] son of perdition that could not be saved
[1:02:11] you also believe that came couldn't be
[1:02:14] saved in the garden because of his
[1:02:17] situation but in the Bible there says to
[1:02:20] Cain if you'd have done once your
[1:02:22] brother Abel done you would have been
[1:02:24] accepted read your Bible
[1:02:25] it says you wouldn't do it what it was
[1:02:27] he say to Judas Judas even though you
[1:02:30] fulfilled all this wording about
[1:02:32] computers would have made it to the
[1:02:34] upper room so what was those Pharisees
[1:02:42] doing stumbling at the word because the
[1:02:45] word had said you're going to crucify
[1:02:52] Messiah you're going to reject him
[1:02:57] you're going to crucify but their
[1:03:03] greatest condemnation was not now listen
[1:03:06] I know I'm a strange preacher but listen
[1:03:08] to the wording the fact of them
[1:03:12] crucifying Jesus Christ is not the worst
[1:03:17] of all sin for you to be a murderer or
[1:03:24] monger or adultery strokes is there any
[1:03:29] difference in one little sin and a whole
[1:03:30] lot of sin
[1:03:31] I thought the Bible said it was a little
[1:03:33] foxes it's for the vine
[1:03:36] mine's it to loot foxes because you
[1:03:38] won't get rid of little foxes because
[1:03:40] you think it ain't big enough hurt
[1:03:41] nothing right what are you saying I'm
[1:03:49] saying that could we today reject the
[1:03:56] Lord Jesus Christ claiming to believe
[1:03:59] him
[1:04:05] the Romans were claiming to believe in
[1:04:11] theater was pretty adamant about their
[1:04:13] situation I mean Paul would there's
[1:04:18] asking a simple question can we stumble
[1:04:23] at the stumbling stone could we reject
[1:04:31] the Lord Jesus Christ yet in every way
[1:04:38] do everything that he says do or not do
[1:04:44] Persis did they kept the law to the
[1:04:48] letter you know what Jesus never come to
[1:04:52] do away with the law Bible says and you
[1:04:55] say Oh Nate didn't know again you come
[1:04:57] to magnify the rigs you Bible he come to
[1:05:01] magnify the law and make it honorable
[1:05:03] the law said thou shalt not commit
[1:05:05] adultery what did Jesus say look on a
[1:05:08] woman with lust in your heart you
[1:05:10] committed her daughter already he
[1:05:11] magnified it what are you trying to get
[1:05:17] true could we be stumbling at the word
[1:05:22] and rejecting it because that we just
[1:05:30] don't believe it that away her brother
[1:05:32] so-and-so didn't say it her you know
[1:05:40] what about it could we be stumbling into
[1:05:43] stumbling-stone the stumbling stone
[1:05:49] we'll get back to later to the Lord
[1:05:51] Jesus Christ as the stumbling stone come
[1:05:52] we know that because we know who is is
[1:05:54] your chief Cornerstone that was the
[1:05:56] point but what about it
[1:06:04] see we need to teach our children to be
[1:06:06] good and do good we need to talk of
[1:06:08] those things that's wonderful because
[1:06:09] that is part of the Word of God but
[1:06:15] teach them that it's not salvation just
[1:06:17] because they're doing good and not doing
[1:06:19] bad don't tell them they're going to
[1:06:23] heaven because of what they have done or
[1:06:25] hadn't done you know your stumbling at
[1:06:31] the word he said you've never heard
[1:06:35] anybody say that Judas Iscariot could
[1:06:37] have been safe why couldn't he if he had
[1:06:41] done rock oh you just don't believe in
[1:06:46] predestination I sure don't believe it's
[1:06:48] your way hungry but what about it could
[1:06:55] we be stumbling it the word that we've
[1:06:57] heard in this life days should President
[1:07:04] Li you talking about lean yes okay solve
[1:07:08] the problem how about you you know one
[1:07:12] comes on Matt Lee you don't wanna come
[1:07:14] come about everybody the rejected stone
[1:07:28] here we're going to go on through and go
[1:07:30] into even to the headstone and the
[1:07:32] stomach and surely if you'd realize it
[1:07:34] we stumble at something strong
[1:07:36] we're surely going to stumble at the
[1:07:37] headstone now I'm going to see what that
[1:07:39] is because you're going stumble we got
[1:07:42] to get it right what their corners tell
[1:07:44] me is you say well the corners telling
[1:07:47] the hits on the same stone I'll agree
[1:07:49] with you to a degree but it's a
[1:07:51] different position and there's also a
[1:07:53] whole lot more of it when you come to
[1:07:55] headstone it's not just come up to the
[1:07:58] one find it know what you see my main
[1:08:04] point of understanding today is one time
[1:08:07] have we rejected Jesus Christ
[1:08:15] because we have some reason or some
[1:08:18] thought in our mind some something that
[1:08:24] we could do or not do that would bring
[1:08:27] us to salvation you ain't go down and go
[1:08:31] to hell for what you doing don't do get
[1:08:33] that out of your mind you're gonna die
[1:08:35] and go to hell because what the Bible
[1:08:36] says he that believeth not is condemned
[1:08:38] already well I believe that through
[1:08:41] Jesus now that's not what it's talking
[1:08:43] about that's what I was getting to
[1:08:48] because see what is the new birth it's
[1:08:51] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:08:54] you not because it was revealed to
[1:08:58] brother Branham not because it revealed
[1:09:00] anybody else because is revealed to you
[1:09:03] as the salvation thank God for the way
[1:09:06] it comes but it's not real until it's
[1:09:11] accepted as to you into our hearts in
[1:09:14] our lives
[1:09:17] who's your stumbling afterward that new
[1:09:26] birth is the greatest thing could ever
[1:09:27] happen to an individual does it puts the
[1:09:32] one inside of you that can lil the lung
[1:09:35] I didn't say it puts it in there and you
[1:09:39] will never do wrong
[1:09:41] I'm not done it just puts the one inside
[1:09:47] of you to lead you makes you a child of
[1:09:53] God
[1:09:54] that's what Israel turned down now
[1:09:59] listen if it's right what Jesus said the
[1:10:01] kingdom be taken from you and give it to
[1:10:02] another
[1:10:03] what was the kingdom sons and daughters
[1:10:05] of the Living God right come on was that
[1:10:08] the children of Israel the children of
[1:10:10] God royal priesthood all that put it to
[1:10:12] Israel there was others right the
[1:10:15] Oracles the word come to them all the
[1:10:17] things come to Israel even the adoption
[1:10:20] pertain to Israel all the things retains
[1:10:22] the Israel but they sought it not by
[1:10:26] faith the by but it was by the works of
[1:10:30] the law because they thought what they'd
[1:10:31] done or didn't do with what God was
[1:10:33] talking about and Jesus never one time
[1:10:40] said accomplished I want to tell you
[1:10:44] where you went wrong it doesn't
[1:10:54] because there was no wrong in his life
[1:10:56] that could be brought up what about you
[1:11:03] not come on musician what about you and
[1:11:05] I today and we accepted Jesus Christ as
[1:11:09] our Savior well yes I've accepted him as
[1:11:12] I say okay
[1:11:13] now question number two as he accepted
[1:11:15] you as he accepted you remember is not
[1:11:24] you accepting him that's wonderful you
[1:11:28] got to do that we got things to do we
[1:11:34] got to follow the line right but has he
[1:11:39] accepted us well I've done all I can do
[1:11:45] and if he ain't accepted me it's his
[1:11:47] fault
[1:11:48] now you better to be careful you're
[1:11:50] getting on dangerous territory I just
[1:11:57] want to make sure one thing if he's
[1:11:59] accepted me I don't have to worry about
[1:12:01] it he's accepted you then he'll prove it
[1:12:06] to you it may be a while before he does
[1:12:10] it somewhere he'll come to you and
[1:12:15] confirm it see then you know for
[1:12:18] yourself not for somebody else
[1:12:21] I told you the story where we was poor
[1:12:26] of us that was baptized years ago in the
[1:12:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just
[1:12:32] one brother come out and told us said I
[1:12:34] believe all four you receive the Holy
[1:12:36] Ghost three of them accepted what the
[1:12:42] brother said I was our are you living I
[1:12:49] talked with him they said that brother
[1:12:52] said I saved and I believe I'm sorry I
[1:12:55] said that brother said I'm saved and I
[1:12:59] ain't saved yet
[1:13:07] you've heard the story about everybody
[1:13:09] to group you know ask them said to the
[1:13:10] Lord save you make up this one little
[1:13:12] boy said Lord anything he's they've done
[1:13:14] nothing yet well at least he was honest
[1:13:17] right this is the way I was I wouldn't
[1:13:21] go take it on that man's word which was
[1:13:23] a good man who took his word on which
[1:13:26] that didn't mean I saw heaped I ordered
[1:13:29] my own experience he said don't you
[1:13:36] think that you had a good affair
[1:13:37] I would an ordained deacon at 23 years
[1:13:40] old so you know they thought a lot of it
[1:13:43] I accepted Jesus Christ when I was 18
[1:13:48] years old
[1:13:54] when I was 29 when he accepted me
[1:14:07] he said what I just don't understand you
[1:14:09] I don't understand how that he's booked
[1:14:12] he accepted two disciples in the upper
[1:14:14] room and he brought to Holy Ghost 120
[1:14:17] why didn't he bring it to the rest of
[1:14:19] the world but he didn't accept him he
[1:14:22] went outside in one sermon which priest
[1:14:24] and 3,000 souls was accepted of God and
[1:14:29] he gave them the baptism in the Holy
[1:14:30] Ghost it's not whether you accept him or
[1:14:33] not it's whether he accepts you if he
[1:14:39] accepts you you let you know so you
[1:14:42] realize then I'm not searching it by
[1:14:44] works or do I'm walking by faith where
[1:14:47] we go let's take what about it could we
[1:14:55] reject the very stone that we claim to
[1:15:01] read how about it
[1:15:14] you know Jesus is your Savior
[1:15:23] if not then you you're the one with a
[1:15:26] problem don't wait too long okay
[1:15:34] but don't ever think now here I know
[1:15:36] because they both I tried to explain it
[1:15:39] I accepted Jesus Christ not 18 years old
[1:15:43] I was 29 years old when I received the
[1:15:47] baptism of the holy go two years I
[1:15:49] recovered in this message I don't put it
[1:15:52] on the fact that I accepted dementia I
[1:15:54] know better than that I want an
[1:15:58] experience that would not be questioned
[1:16:02] not just guy executive because of this I
[1:16:05] wanted something for him to accept me
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:11] for two years in this message I prayed
[1:16:14] the study fasted run all over the
[1:16:17] country everybody to pray for me
[1:16:20] one day I realised that wasn't what it
[1:16:23] was
[1:16:26] one day I realized that it was the word
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:35] so I just took his word and let it right
[1:16:38] back before leave your word you said if
[1:16:43] I do this you're do this I've done all I
[1:16:47] can do Lord that's up to you

[1:16:59] a problem it is no question about it I

[1:18:18] word speak to my heart yeah but I've

[1:18:50] for this one order trying to get us all
[1:18:53] to a point to where we can think about
[1:18:55] ourselves and not to think about others
[1:18:59] and what they are and be concerned about
[1:19:01] that but to be concerned about our own
[1:19:03] sales to examine ourselves as we try to
