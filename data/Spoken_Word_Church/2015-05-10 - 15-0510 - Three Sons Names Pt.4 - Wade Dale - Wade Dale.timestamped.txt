[0:00] demo mode we're recording man
[0:03] yeah all right that's john 1. in the
[0:05] beginning was uh
[0:08] logos
[0:09] and the logos was with god
[0:12] and the logos was god amen amen
[0:15] everybody enjoying this so far
[0:17] have i lost anybody because if i have i
[0:19] don't want to i don't want to lose
[0:20] anybody on the way through this i want
[0:22] us to
[0:23] i'm still thinking
[0:25] um
[0:27] and i may do it upstairs
[0:30] uh preach the sermons
[0:32] preach the sermon
[0:34] preach the sermon on the logo
[0:39] all right
[0:41] well now what
[0:54] but i want it now
[0:58] but i remember what i'm still i'm still
[1:00] thinking more on the logos being
[1:02] watching and looking at the
[1:05] um
[1:06] logo
[1:07] are
[1:09] because remember
[1:12] the logos was the word
[1:15] and you don't want to say was the word
[1:17] he is the word we've got to use it we
[1:19] got to use the word he is as ever
[1:21] present because he's all he's not he
[1:23] he never was or was
[1:26] he is the logos he is these attributes
[1:29] he doesn't lose any of these
[1:32] right
[1:33] and he doesn't gain them
[1:35] because remember when i was a child
[1:38] potentially i was a father
[1:40] right i definitely know i was a son
[1:43] but see us not all knowing god all
[1:45] knowing that's why we must understand
[1:47] this
[1:48] this condescending of god because you
[1:50] and i can't comprehend it as human
[1:52] beings when i was running around playing
[1:54] with the with the neighbors and we were
[1:56] out you know hunting and fishing and
[1:57] doing all these things
[1:59] i had no clue about being a father
[2:02] but yet that potential was in me
[2:05] because what i was a human i was born a
[2:07] male you see what i'm talking about okay
[2:10] because we have a beginning we are
[2:12] finite
[2:13] god does not have a beginning god is
[2:16] infinite okay
[2:18] so but but still we must use man as an
[2:22] example
[2:23] we have to use the daily life of human
[2:26] beings as an example to understand god
[2:29] and then let god raise that level up a
[2:31] little bit higher
[2:33] so
[2:35] in the beginning was the word you say
[2:36] well in we say many times we hold up the
[2:39] bible we say
[2:40] this was before the eternal well this
[2:42] wasn't right this
[2:44] wasn't right
[2:46] because remember when we go back to
[2:48] where we were supposed to be had they
[2:50] not been a fall
[2:51] we're not going to carry bibles around
[2:53] right
[2:54] we are going to be the word
[2:57] all right we are the word made flesh now
[2:59] but potentially
[3:01] we were then but remember god knew he
[3:05] was going to be a father he knew he was
[3:06] going to be a son he knew he was going
[3:07] to be all these attributes because he
[3:09] could see all the way through eternity
[3:12] but you and i can't but the the
[3:14] attribute that he had in him were not
[3:18] being able not able to be displayed
[3:22] until he condescended himself down
[3:25] everybody got that
[3:27] until he until something went forth from
[3:29] god
[3:30] he couldn't be a father
[3:32] a father to be a father you've got to
[3:33] have a child or you've got to have a son
[3:35] you've got to have something to portray
[3:38] that father attribute
[3:41] okay
[3:44] same thing with savior
[3:46] he was a savior when he said let there
[3:48] be he don't you think he knew what was
[3:49] going to happen in the garden of eden
[3:50] soon as he put out of the navy flesh
[3:53] sometimes we lose that
[3:55] thought that that that god's going to
[3:57] make god's got this great eternal vision
[4:00] and everything so perfect and complete
[4:02] it is
[4:03] but don't you think he knew what was
[4:04] going to happen when he put adam in
[4:06] flesh
[4:08] and separated it he knew but remember
[4:11] there's no way he could portray savior
[4:15] to adam and eve
[4:18] before the fall right in eternity
[4:21] before the fall adam and eve did not
[4:23] need a savior
[4:25] at that moment right right
[4:28] the youth was being renewed they were
[4:31] talking to god every day they were
[4:33] everything was just a a garden of eden
[4:37] right
[4:38] but when sent him in the picture the
[4:40] attribute of savior well now look adam
[4:42] and eve didn't need a healer
[4:44] right before the fall
[4:47] right right they didn't have to go look
[4:49] for a um um
[4:52] jehovah gyra
[4:54] right but yet jehovah came and talked to
[4:57] him every day
[5:00] the savior came and talked to adam and
[5:02] eve every day
[5:03] that's what we got to understand about
[5:05] god
[5:07] he always had these attributes he always
[5:09] was a human being he always had the
[5:11] that's what me and brother bob was
[5:13] talking about the other day
[5:18] our brain we only use they say what ten
[5:20] percent
[5:22] some of us less
[5:26] you can move the decimal a couple of
[5:28] places
[5:29] but you know why i'm like louise i gotta
[5:31] i gotta be a loser before i'm being
[5:32] winner i gotta lose this brain that i
[5:34] got
[5:35] but remember
[5:36] everything that you see
[5:38] that happened from the garden of eden
[5:41] to all the way through eternity
[5:44] god had it in his brain
[5:47] you say well god don't have a brain well
[5:49] if god don't have a brain we'll have a
[5:51] brain right right
[5:53] if we were made in his image created in
[5:54] his image his brain
[5:57] knew every person that was going to be
[5:58] on the earth
[5:59] the day they were going to be born the
[6:01] day they were going to die everything
[6:03] they would think in between and there's
[6:06] 7 billion people on the earth now with
[6:08] 12 or 14 000 different languages on the
[6:10] earth
[6:12] and he knew that before before he even
[6:15] started
[6:17] in his brain
[6:19] in his brain
[6:20] see they they they in the world they
[6:23] make god is some got this great big head
[6:26] you know
[6:28] and or he's nothing but just a brain
[6:31] no he's a human he just used all of his
[6:33] capacity he you and i are a cup full of
[6:36] the ocean
[6:38] god is the old ocean so he knew he he
[6:41] threw his brain
[6:42] because you we're going to read in a
[6:44] minute what brother branham was talking
[6:45] about
[6:48] god if he kept it in his mind he could
[6:50] never be any of these attributes if he
[6:52] just kept it up here
[6:54] he had to become something
[6:57] we could understand call the logos or
[7:00] the word when he could step forth and
[7:03] what
[7:04] see remember brother brown said it's
[7:06] always got to be a thought first then
[7:07] it's a word
[7:09] but remember when god thought it
[7:12] it was eternal so it was perfect there's
[7:14] no other way it could be but he had to
[7:16] speak it
[7:18] for us to be able to understand it and
[7:20] for us to be for him to be a savior he
[7:23] had to say
[7:24] genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity
[7:27] see there's the savior coming into being
[7:29] all those attributes listen brother
[7:31] brown said the book of genesis
[7:32] everything begun in genesis
[7:35] so the savior began in genesis hey he
[7:37] was a savior before adam and eve did
[7:39] what they did or god would have killed
[7:41] them both not just one of them both of
[7:42] them
[7:43] all right
[7:44] um
[7:45] i always had a question about before the
[7:47] eternal to something that's eternalism
[7:51] and brother grandpa said that elohim was
[7:53] alone with his boss but let's talk
[7:56] no
[7:58] that's right
[7:59] if he would have ever said a word it
[8:01] would have to start happening
[8:03] but i'm thinking before this
[8:05] before the word yes
[8:07] before the word
[8:09] before there was an actual but now
[8:11] remember
[8:13] here's where you can get real technical
[8:15] with this
[8:16] because remember the thoughts of god are
[8:18] eternal
[8:19] eternal never was or never is are never
[8:22] coming or back it is
[8:25] so that's why
[8:27] you stump people when you say
[8:29] did god think of this and then it
[8:31] happened
[8:32] or is this the thoughts of god happening
[8:34] now
[8:36] because if he thought about it and then
[8:37] there was any gap of time between the
[8:40] part of it
[8:41] taking place that's not eternal
[8:47] said it again that's not eternal
[8:50] if god listen me and you think of
[8:51] something
[8:53] then we filter it through our brain and
[8:55] then we speak it and hey it may not
[8:56] happen even if it does happen
[8:59] there's a gap of time in between
[9:02] right
[9:04] if god's a second older than when he
[9:07] said let there be light he's not eternal
[9:09] one second
[9:13] this is the thoughts of god happening
[9:15] now
[9:17] you've got to see that or you don't or
[9:18] he's not eternal
[9:20] you've got to see that this is not what
[9:22] he thought this is what he's thinking
[9:26] you know if you don't believe in one god
[9:29] completely believe in one god you're
[9:32] gonna put word as god logos is god this
[9:36] is god you don't separate them out
[9:38] you're going to separate them that's
[9:39] what man has done they've separated that
[9:42] it's not separated it's one god
[9:46] sure god dwelt along with his thoughts
[9:48] but how do you dwell in eternity that's
[9:50] only the way we can talk about it is in
[9:52] time
[9:56] but remember if god said let there be
[9:58] and brother brown said it might have
[9:59] been 10 billion years ago
[10:01] if he's one second older than when he
[10:03] said let there be he's not eternal he's
[10:05] not old that's not old to god
[10:10] it's all for us
[10:12] it's all for us it's not for him it's
[10:15] all for us to understand him and to
[10:18] understand what his thoughts are this is
[10:20] the thoughts of god or we're a second
[10:22] person
[10:24] but mom's saying if this is not the very
[10:26] thoughts of god
[10:28] then we have developed something else
[10:33] another person that had to turn around
[10:35] and do the speaking
[10:38] do you understand what i'm saying father
[10:40] i'm a father
[10:42] but for me to be a father josh had to be
[10:44] born there's a gap of time there
[10:47] but god always was the father he always
[10:49] was a son he always but yes there is a
[10:52] time that's why brother roman says back
[10:53] before the eternal but now remember the
[10:55] bible says the beginning of the creation
[10:57] of god
[10:59] wendy what was god's first creation
[11:01] brother brown said god
[11:04] object of worship
[11:07] looks like too
[11:09] not
[11:10] not
[11:11] we're not there
[11:12] the angels were created first remember
[11:16] we are of the very part of god
[11:20] wear the eternal part if you're born
[11:22] again that's that genesis 1 man if you
[11:24] don't understand that genesis 1 26 man
[11:26] you absolutely have two people that's
[11:29] why the people that preach
[11:31] jesus what god and all these other
[11:33] things they are absolutely showing
[11:36] that there's two people
[11:39] but when you understand that genesis one
[11:40] man which we haven't got to yet we gotta
[11:42] get to when we get to that genesis one
[11:45] man that is not a creation as we say
[11:49] creation i've already been through this
[11:50] i've preached it all for 15 years daddy
[11:53] has two
[11:55] the genesis 1 26 man was not nothing and
[11:58] then became something right
[12:03] let's go to genesis 1. and since we have
[12:06] our concordance
[12:09] let's see what
[12:14] that word
[12:16] created me
[12:21] shape
[12:22] or form fashion
[12:27] not create is nothing and then there's
[12:29] something
[12:33] i've explained it a hundred times
[12:35] a car was in the garden of eden
[12:39] that table was in the garden of eden
[12:41] that chair was in the garden of eden
[12:42] this computer was in the garden of eden
[12:45] literally
[12:48] because all the elements that make this
[12:50] up
[12:52] was in the ground in the garden of eden
[12:56] man has created a car
[13:02] man has formed
[13:04] a car
[13:06] the car always was there
[13:10] everybody got that yeah you make it
[13:12] sound like the car was there but the
[13:14] elements that made the car from there
[13:18] the car was there the car was there yeah
[13:21] but when you say literally
[13:23] literally
[13:24] if it's wasn't literally there then
[13:25] where'd it come from there wasn't a
[13:27] chevy sitting in the garden
[13:28] i said car i didn't say shovelling
[13:34] i'm not putting i'm listening i'm not
[13:36] putting a logo on it i said a car
[13:39] what you see the car you see was in the
[13:41] garden of eden
[13:43] the rubber
[13:45] the ore right the alloy
[13:48] the steel
[13:51] the rough plastic
[13:54] everything
[13:55] it was in the garden of eden all the
[13:57] elements that's why there's nothing new
[13:58] under the sun
[14:01] but what did man do
[14:03] man took his finite brain
[14:07] and created a car
[14:11] from those elements
[14:13] but the elements were already there so
[14:16] so now
[14:17] did man create a car no car was always
[14:20] there
[14:21] carl was always in the garden of eden
[14:23] it was laying there brother brown said
[14:25] our bodies was laying in there
[14:30] but something had to shape or form it
[14:34] create
[14:36] henry ford created the car
[14:39] he is the creator of the car
[14:41] he put all these elements together and
[14:44] created a car but he didn't create like
[14:47] we're like nothing and then we got
[14:48] something no
[14:50] everything we see that come up that
[14:51] we're looking at even now
[14:54] come from this earth right everything
[14:56] you
[14:57] your watch your glasses
[14:59] computers does everybody understand that
[15:02] this
[15:03] this come from the earth
[15:06] man has just formed it into a hard
[15:08] substance
[15:10] created
[15:12] sand scenic sand and sea man and lime
[15:16] limestone
[15:17] what man has done is like brother brown
[15:18] said man has took things and created and
[15:22] killed
[15:25] brass was in the garden of eden
[15:27] gunpowder was in the garden of eden man
[15:30] just put it in a bullet and been killing
[15:31] each other with it right but there was
[15:33] always there
[15:35] i've always said that what god created
[15:37] in the original
[15:40] what god created in near reach are
[15:41] brought to view in the original we'll go
[15:44] back to that
[15:46] we won't need cars in the garden we
[15:48] won't need computers in the garden we
[15:50] won't need these tables in the garden
[15:52] cities are going to be gold
[15:57] element
[15:59] trees and everything's going to be just
[16:00] like it was in the garden
[16:02] all right so that word create don't say
[16:04] god created man like there was nothing
[16:07] because remember
[16:09] see this word god
[16:10] that god word god we're getting ahead of
[16:13] ourselves for a reason i guess
[16:15] because we got to go backwards now but
[16:17] this is when that logos began to speak
[16:20] and said let us make man
[16:22] so god
[16:24] which was what
[16:29] elohim
[16:32] brother brown said that's elohim
[16:34] self-existing
[16:37] all right
[16:41] god light one
[16:43] works for special possessions of god
[16:46] if you'll make sure let me give you
[16:47] another thing here if you if you look
[16:50] this gives you all the references in the
[16:51] bible where that's used and it's the
[16:53] same definitions everybody everybody
[16:54] ever seen that before
[16:57] that word elohim is used 2074 times
[17:00] under the word god
[17:02] in the bible so you can find that
[17:06] use it usage by word by that word all
[17:09] right
[17:13] what helped me
[17:14] when i saw it he said you'll eat your
[17:17] weather and your mom eats you here sure
[17:20] absolutely about what we eat
[17:23] it's all about what we eat we can't we
[17:25] can't survive without eating something
[17:28] okay your mama eat you well see you
[17:30] always say well how'd you get here well
[17:32] look your daddy
[17:35] ate potatoes that come out of the 16
[17:37] elements of the ground
[17:39] he ate that potato that potato became
[17:41] whatever potassium calcium whatever
[17:44] broke down in your body went to blood
[17:47] went to sperm
[17:49] were adults here went to sperm mama ate
[17:53] the same potato
[17:55] but her attribute was to be the mama
[17:59] she didn't have sperm she had egg
[18:01] so that egg developed because of the
[18:03] potato
[18:05] the potassium the calcium and all that
[18:07] formed then
[18:09] the two of you ate and got together one
[18:11] night evening morning
[18:13] it doesn't matter
[18:14] after you ate
[18:16] got strong
[18:19] and here come a baby but what's that
[18:21] baby made out of the same 16 that wants
[18:24] a germain out of them potatoes to give
[18:27] it to that boat yeah well you
[18:29] and potatoes may have something to do
[18:31] with this i don't know potatoes
[18:34] potatoes
[18:39] he eats a lot of
[18:40] potatoes we've learned something now
[18:43] it's going all over the internet
[18:45] okay ryan wake up
[18:48] look so god created man in other words
[18:50] watch what brother brown said god
[18:52] created something off of himself and he
[18:54] continued to be god
[18:57] right now remember in genesis 2 7 when
[19:00] he put that 126 man into a flesh body he
[19:04] became the lord god jehovah with a
[19:06] family right he didn't gain that
[19:08] attribute
[19:10] he just was able to display that
[19:12] attribute
[19:13] when he could look and see adam and eve
[19:17] all right
[19:18] because truly that logos went into adam
[19:22] right
[19:24] that logos went into adam
[19:28] right
[19:29] and then adam could say
[19:32] elephant
[19:33] lion tiger tree go over here wind
[19:37] settled down
[19:38] he was the spokesman or the logo
[19:42] he was the first original son of god
[19:45] what the bible says we'll read it next
[19:47] sunday maybe lord willing
[19:49] because he gives all the lineages and
[19:51] comes right down to adam and he says
[19:52] which adam is the son of god i think
[19:54] it's in luke
[19:56] but god created man in his own image
[20:00] so let's go back now back up so so maybe
[20:03] that'll help you when when somebody says
[20:07] well i created that
[20:09] well don't get real stumped
[20:12] it wasn't that he went
[20:14] no
[20:15] he formed it he shaped it same way with
[20:18] god god shaped man in his own image
[20:22] in other words it was god in another
[20:23] form just like josh's me in another form
[20:27] but we are individual
[20:30] human beings that have different traits
[20:32] and attributes god is not three or four
[20:34] and doesn't have different traits and
[20:35] attributes he's got one
[20:37] he's god
[20:39] he's elohim he's the creator i like what
[20:42] brother dick says because sometimes you
[20:43] can get hung up with the word god did
[20:45] but when you say creator there's only
[20:47] one person that creates
[20:49] one
[20:50] there's only one creator
[20:52] because you can call satan god
[20:56] right
[20:57] all the time they do it
[21:00] people can use jesus christ's name in in
[21:03] a different way than he is and and be
[21:05] saying the name
[21:07] but there's only one creator right and
[21:09] that creator is elohim the logos the
[21:13] savior the healer the theophany the
[21:15] christ
[21:16] all that
[21:18] that's the only way he can create is to
[21:20] be all them if he does not have these
[21:22] already then he's he's not complete
[21:28] you hear that
[21:30] to be the creator
[21:32] everything that comes from him
[21:35] has everything that he creates had to
[21:36] come from him right
[21:40] even satan
[21:41] right but satan had choice just like you
[21:44] and i have a choice all right
[21:46] you and i have a choice
[21:48] satan has a choice
[21:50] because remember god said so here's the
[21:53] speech
[21:54] go back to genesis 1 1 in the beginning
[21:57] god created the heaven
[22:00] and the earth
[22:01] now remember
[22:05] watch this it let there be light and
[22:07] there was light
[22:08] god saw light it was good
[22:10] that has nothing to do with the moon in
[22:12] the sun
[22:16] nothing
[22:18] to do with the moon in the sun
[22:20] the moon in the sun is created on down
[22:22] here further
[22:24] right
[22:25] so this is the light
[22:27] this is
[22:28] the logo
[22:30] that's coming down so that you can see
[22:31] it sure he's the one to create it but
[22:33] god saw the light that it was good and
[22:36] god divided the light from the darkness
[22:41] satan's children
[22:43] our children god called the light day in
[22:45] the darkness he called night
[22:47] and the evening in the morning with the
[22:48] first day but remember
[22:50] you got to go a little bit further
[23:00] well i'm gonna go here but i guess we
[23:01] will
[23:05] god made verse 16
[23:07] and god made two great lights
[23:09] well now if he made one without if you
[23:11] create him over there he's creating them
[23:12] again
[23:14] he made two great lights the greater
[23:16] lightning ruled the day and the lesser
[23:17] light to rule the night he made the
[23:19] stars also
[23:20] god set them in the firm of the heaven
[23:22] to give light upon the earth
[23:24] well i thought this was what this was
[23:26] over here
[23:27] it's not
[23:30] that light is him
[23:33] that light is him coming to an earth
[23:35] he's created the earth and he's coming
[23:37] down now to divide what the light from
[23:40] the darkness
[23:42] what is darkness darkness is an absence
[23:44] of light
[23:47] the earth was without
[23:48] foreign darkness was upon the face of
[23:50] the deed
[23:51] all right the spirit of god moved upon
[23:53] the face of the water and god said let
[23:54] there be light and there was light
[23:57] all right
[23:59] because remember like i said he always
[24:00] was light
[24:02] we're going back to the halo we're going
[24:03] back to the theophany we're going back
[24:05] to the logos he is the light what is he
[24:08] doing he's coming to earth to do the
[24:10] creating brother brown says right here
[24:11] we'll read it maybe next sunday
[24:14] he brutal he he moved over and brooded
[24:17] over the earth
[24:18] that's what he's doing now he's brooding
[24:21] over the earth let there be let there be
[24:24] let there be
[24:25] right
[24:30] because remember i found one right here
[24:32] i want to read
[24:34] and if you don't mind i'm not going to
[24:36] give you the title to the messages
[24:38] i'm going to read you what brother brown
[24:40] said it really doesn't matter what title
[24:41] the message is
[24:43] everybody understand that
[24:45] actually my computer didn't put them on
[24:47] there
[24:48] so
[24:50] listen
[24:52] if you got a revelation of the true word
[24:54] of this message of the hour you don't
[24:55] need 64 65 61 54 47 48 you don't need
[25:00] any of that
[25:02] you don't even need to know where it was
[25:03] preached at
[25:04] what's the matter
[25:06] what does it matter
[25:08] did they did paul tell you everywhere he
[25:09] wrote his
[25:11] sure he said well he said to the
[25:12] galatians well he may have already left
[25:14] the galatians to be sitting in prison in
[25:16] rome writing about the galatians so what
[25:18] does it matter
[25:19] don't make any difference
[25:20] so i'm not going to read these to you
[25:22] because i don't have them
[25:24] but i promise you they were from 47 to
[25:26] 52 because i only got to 1952 with these
[25:29] quotes okay
[25:30] and i didn't put them on here but i'm
[25:32] going to read a couple of them right
[25:33] here
[25:38] like someone was asking the other day
[25:40] god what was he when he was back under
[25:42] millions and millions of years ago
[25:45] when he was not just like this space
[25:47] here and then he gathered up into the
[25:49] logos
[25:50] and then he came from the logos down
[25:52] into christ
[25:54] see it's just god coming down like this
[25:56] to the earth
[25:58] then going right back into god again
[26:00] don't you see what i mean just revolving
[26:02] coming down from space from eternity
[26:05] rolling together coming down into the
[26:07] logos and the logos down into man then
[26:10] returning back right back again for one
[26:12] purpose to redeem that man that has
[26:14] fallen
[26:15] now see we can wrap all this up just by
[26:17] that
[26:19] god condescends to the earth to save man
[26:22] that's the only reason
[26:24] i believe he lived on earth that's just
[26:26] me he said well i know he lived in
[26:28] heaven
[26:30] where we gonna live
[26:32] where's god gonna live when this is over
[26:35] right here
[26:36] right so i believe this was his
[26:38] residence to start with
[26:39] okay
[26:40] brother uh the bible says in psalms that
[26:43] heaven and earth is kissed
[26:45] okay so heaven earth must be pretty
[26:46] close together
[26:48] all right
[26:48] so watch what he says here though
[26:53] he came down here for one purpose to
[26:55] what redeemed man
[26:57] then he's going to carry us back
[27:00] into the eternity right we just dropped
[27:02] down into time and he's going to carry
[27:04] us right back up into eternity and god
[27:06] in the beginning made his first man
[27:08] he made him out of the spirit
[27:10] and spirit is the invisible part of land
[27:13] that you don't see now remember
[27:15] this is his 1947 is where this is coming
[27:18] from because this is the first quote so
[27:20] i know it came from 1947 and he made him
[27:23] out of spirit the spirit is the
[27:24] invisible part of man that you don't see
[27:27] now god made man in his own image are
[27:29] you listening to me the congregation
[27:30] said amen all right
[27:32] god made him in his own image and god is
[27:34] the spirit says the bible and the first
[27:36] man that was made had the government
[27:38] over all the creation
[27:40] just like the holy spirit has government
[27:43] over the church today he led the
[27:46] creation
[27:50] so adam was the first poster child
[27:53] of a son of god
[27:55] or the logo
[27:57] he was the one
[27:59] that
[27:59] it's like i said before
[28:01] so you can take this is the way god did
[28:04] it
[28:05] so this is the way i see it
[28:07] like i was saying before i'm gonna say
[28:08] it one more time you take
[28:11] um
[28:12] microsoft
[28:14] now
[28:15] every component that microsoft made
[28:18] let's go back was in the earth
[28:20] right
[28:22] bill gates and a couple other guys
[28:24] sitting in a college dorm in the in the
[28:27] late 70s
[28:28] they're in their human brain they're
[28:31] coming up with these ideas to create
[28:34] a company called microsoft
[28:37] all right
[28:38] but now to take microsoft today
[28:41] and write everything
[28:43] i mean 100 000 people work for microsoft
[28:46] they produce
[28:48] 17 million computers they
[28:50] you see what i'm talking about it would
[28:51] be a book this thick if you wrote a book
[28:54] about microsoft
[28:56] but they have done so well promoting
[28:58] their product
[28:59] with logos and with this and with that
[29:01] and with speech words
[29:04] then i can sit here and i pretty much
[29:05] know what microsoft is without going and
[29:07] reading a book this thick
[29:09] everybody get that
[29:11] some of you don't
[29:15] listen if all that was in god's mind was
[29:17] put in the book you couldn't
[29:20] if we would link
[29:22] the ocean field
[29:24] and where the skies are parchment made
[29:28] and every stall
[29:29] on earth the quill and every man
[29:32] a scribe by trade
[29:34] to write the love
[29:36] of god above see the song the song the
[29:38] song will tell you there's no way you
[29:40] can explain god but he comes down into
[29:43] something that we can see called logos
[29:45] word speech so he can so he can what
[29:47] promote his product and i hope god's not
[29:50] bothered with me saying that
[29:52] because his product is eternal life
[29:56] to me if you take god down to one thing
[29:58] is eternal life
[29:59] he is the eternal
[30:01] so he wants us to understand that
[30:03] because that's what we're going to
[30:06] what we come from is what we're going to
[30:08] jesus said i come from god i go back to
[30:10] god in other words i come from logan
[30:12] i'll go back to the logos all right
[30:14] so you and i
[30:16] have to be
[30:20] now the little poster child
[30:23] because we should act like god but the
[30:25] very first one was god himself and he's
[30:27] saying hey this is what i'm this is what
[30:30] i am
[30:31] without writing
[30:33] a 700 000 page
[30:35] book
[30:37] they won't even get started
[30:40] i've narrowed it all down
[30:42] to 66 books in the bible
[30:45] and that's me
[30:47] now you say well that's pretty
[30:49] narrow-minded well
[30:51] out of those 66 books of the bible even
[30:53] since the book
[30:55] in the 1500s was put together
[30:57] tell me how many millions of sermons has
[31:00] been preached out of that bible
[31:02] since the 1500s to now and continuing on
[31:05] how many millions of sermons has been
[31:07] taken
[31:08] well see if you compile them all in a
[31:10] book
[31:12] you couldn't read it
[31:13] right so you see what god's doing that
[31:15] logos is the holy ghost that's the holy
[31:17] spirit that's leading you today that's
[31:19] the reason
[31:21] let me just say this plain if you don't
[31:23] have the holy ghost you can't understand
[31:25] what he's saying because the holy ghost
[31:27] is the one that said let there be light
[31:29] the holy ghost is the one that's give us
[31:31] the message of the hour the holy ghost
[31:32] is the one that
[31:34] i've always said that if you wrote the
[31:36] if you wrote the book
[31:39] surely you ought to know what what's in
[31:41] it
[31:44] did you hear what i said if you wrote
[31:46] the book
[31:48] i hope you know if you have the holy
[31:50] ghost you wrote the book
[31:54] because there's not two holy ghosts you
[31:55] don't get the holy ghost down here to
[31:57] understand what this hellhole goes
[31:58] saying no same old
[32:02] same holy ghost
[32:04] let me read you this one right here i
[32:05] want you to read this right here
[32:09] now everybody says you know watch
[32:11] brother around the slip of his tongue he
[32:12] put this supernatural being which was
[32:14] called man the third person of the
[32:16] trinity
[32:17] holy spirit into mankind
[32:21] see if you just take that one quote then
[32:23] you got him a trinitarian
[32:25] but it's not you go back a little bit
[32:27] further he's absolutely explaining and
[32:29] this is a long one we gotta go
[32:31] but um
[32:32] remember one thing's for sure we've got
[32:34] to get in our mind we i don't think we
[32:36] truly understand one god and i say we i
[32:38] mean me
[32:40] one god with many attributes
[32:52] that's right
[32:56] that's why the low god if we understand
[32:58] the logos
[33:00] see we understand him better because
[33:02] that's where his speech is coming from
[33:03] it's coming from that low gospel coming
[33:05] from the word of god but as a human
[33:06] being no you're dead
[33:22] that's right back with us yep
