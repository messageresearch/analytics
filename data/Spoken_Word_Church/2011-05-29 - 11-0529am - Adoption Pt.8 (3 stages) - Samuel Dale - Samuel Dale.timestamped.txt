[36:14] Ephesians
[36:16] 1 I keep reading this because we're
[36:19] still dealing with
[36:21] predestination now
[36:23] remember it is not the person that comes
[36:26] predestinated eternal
[36:28] it is the word or seed of God all right
[36:31] but then there has to be a
[36:34] place when Martin Luther when he reached
[36:36] a place God came down with a word he had
[36:40] to be in the right place for God to
[36:42] bring the word to him there had to be
[36:44] all kind of troubles in Israel before
[36:46] God sent Moses there's always doing but
[36:49] see in in here we come down and we're
[36:52] trying to talk on it because in this day
[36:55] Time and Eternity is going to have to
[36:56] meet right here
[36:58] amen if not when will it meet it will
[37:00] have to meet sometime why can't we
[37:03] believe that we're here at that time
[37:05] where it can take place all right see
[37:07] and that's that's the only only thing
[37:09] I've been trying to tell you and to get
[37:10] a point to you okay Ephesians 1 verse3
[37:14] blessed be the God and father of our
[37:16] Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with
[37:18] all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[37:20] places in Christ according as he has
[37:22] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[37:25] of the world that we should be holy and
[37:27] Without Blame BL before him in love
[37:29] having predestinated us unto the
[37:32] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[37:35] himself according to the good pleasure
[37:37] of his will to the praise of the glory
[37:39] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[37:42] accepted in the
[37:45] Beloved all we go over
[37:47] to 1 Peter
[37:52] 4 and we'll begin reading at verse 12-4
[37:59] beloved think it not strange concerning
[38:01] the fiery trial which is to try you now
[38:04] keep that in mind is to try
[38:07] you as though some strange thing
[38:09] happened unto you and we don't count it
[38:12] strange when things start going wrong
[38:15] they to try you all right now is that
[38:18] true then all right but what does it say
[38:21] but
[38:22] Rejoice now brother Richard and I were
[38:25] talking this morning about the the
[38:27] things that are going on around the
[38:29] world you know that's a that was told us
[38:31] by the prophet and is told us by the
[38:33] Bible that will take place right that is
[38:36] the word of God and it will not be
[38:37] changed it will take place but we don't
[38:40] Rejoice because people are being killed
[38:43] right no we feel sorry for those people
[38:47] but the word of God is going to be
[38:50] fulfilled so we Rejoice because of the
[38:53] word right now you understand what it's
[38:55] getting to but rejoice in so much says
[38:57] you are partakers of Christ suffering
[38:59] that when his glory shall be revealed
[39:01] you may be ye may be glad also with
[39:05] exceeding
[39:06] Joy if ye be reproached for the name of
[39:09] Christ happy are ye for the spirit of
[39:12] glory and of God resteth upon you on
[39:16] their part he is evil spoken of but on
[39:19] your part he is glorified you may be
[39:22] seated GL at his Blessing to the reading
[39:25] of the word
[39:28] now keep in mind what we're talking
[39:32] about
[39:34] adoption and showing it in three
[39:39] stages you know to try to break it down
[39:42] to where we can understand it
[39:44] better and uh
[39:47] the not
[39:49] missing the things that we need to
[39:52] see
[39:55] because the the whole stage of a
[39:58] person's journey in Christ is
[40:00] adoption bringing us into the family of
[40:03] God see and doing that we we become
[40:08] God's children he adopts us into the
[40:11] family as we'll get back to it in a
[40:14] little bit you know in the message
[40:15] because see it's it's hard to say to
[40:18] just come out and say something without
[40:21] explaining it because you know people
[40:23] will go so many different
[40:26] ways with what what you're saying so I
[40:28] try to take it slow and and you know and
[40:31] I'm sorry uh that's just the way I am I
[40:34] guess but I want you to understand see
[40:39] even like that as I'll repeat this in a
[40:41] minute even like the Lord Jesus when he
[40:43] reached a you know a certain age there
[40:45] in his natural life he was probably
[40:47] adopted because of the Customs that the
[40:50] people of Israel had he probably went
[40:52] through that bar ever how you
[40:55] pronounce that big old word that means
[40:56] they
[40:57] adoption he went through that
[41:00] naturally and he was born to almighty
[41:03] God all right but yet he went
[41:06] through a river Jordan experience a
[41:09] manner Transfiguration experience and a
[41:12] change of the
[41:14] body all right see but yet still you
[41:17] don't discount that he was naturally
[41:21] adopted but the natural adoption didn't
[41:24] do his spiritual adoption so the one of
[41:27] them would be a natural situation of
[41:29] life that we adopt people's children and
[41:31] all but in the spiritual condition God
[41:34] doesn't adopt them somebody else's
[41:35] children he only adopts his own children
[41:39] all right so that that's that's a
[41:41] different doing and you got to keep that
[41:43] in mind because the human mind will just
[41:45] throw into to uh into gear in different
[41:49] things and and and you won't understand
[41:51] but now I'll repeat some of that in a
[41:53] minute but I want you to get it because
[41:55] the last message we were trying to
[41:57] explain or have been trying to explain
[41:59] that there is a time in a Christian's
[42:02] Journey that you're born again that
[42:07] makes you a child of God that fulfills
[42:10] Romans 8 about 14 and 15 there where
[42:13] whereby the spirit of adoption see you
[42:16] receive the Holy Spirit the spirit of
[42:19] adoption all right we found that in in
[42:22] trying to bring it that it is not the
[42:25] the brother R said God G gives us a holy
[42:28] spirit to tutor us all right but the
[42:30] holy spirit is the spirit of the father
[42:33] or else you got two Gods you know are
[42:35] you or Jesus brother R said have two
[42:37] daddies so that wouldn't work so the
[42:39] Holy Spirit and the spirit of God the
[42:42] Father whatever you want to call it
[42:43] would be the self-same spirit so in the
[42:47] natural adoption the tutor is hired by
[42:49] the father to tutor the child you know
[42:52] which is a different person but in the
[42:54] spiritual condition of adoption God
[42:57] comes down to live in You and I by the
[43:01] new birth and that is the tutor to child
[43:04] train us and to bring us to the place to
[43:07] where that it can be finished that we
[43:09] can do the other parts of the the doing
[43:12] that's why I titled it adoption in three
[43:14] stages because I believe in things being
[43:18] Progressive I believe in progressive
[43:20] revelation I don't believe God gives it
[43:22] all to you at one time I believe he
[43:24] gives it to us gradually all right I
[43:26] believe in things all in life is
[43:28] Progressive you're eating you're you're
[43:30] growing and and things like that it's
[43:32] Progressive all right in science it's
[43:34] Progressive look at the science from
[43:36] even in my day of coming from a a horse
[43:39] and and and and know we couldn't even
[43:41] afford a buggy uh a mutant wagon what we
[43:45] had in going to church in a mutant wagon
[43:47] and you know and then coming up to where
[43:50] you know you're in the Jet Plane and the
[43:51] interplanetary travels and all of the
[43:54] thing so everything is Progressive
[43:57] well why would we worry to think about
[43:59] God doing his ways in a progressive form
[44:03] you know to do it all right see now the
[44:05] child training then is what's been going
[44:08] on from the time you receive the new
[44:10] birth and if you receive it today that
[44:12] starts your child training that's why we
[44:14] don't preach something as a blunt thing
[44:17] uh you know we get man the other day S
[44:19] one said all redemption's over you know
[44:21] and there's no more people being saved
[44:23] and all this that and the other well you
[44:25] know I don't agree cuz i f step the
[44:27] first come in the message there in in'
[44:30] 67 and they said you couldn't be saved
[44:32] after 63 I said I'm sorry cuz I'm going
[44:35] to seek God until I get it well you know
[44:37] in 1969 I received it and you know that
[44:40] I didn't have no more problems with with
[44:42] no troubles or even thoughts about it
[44:44] because I experienced it see I don't
[44:47] care what you think about me that's what
[44:49] I'm saying about what happened so then
[44:52] you know that would bring it to a place
[44:54] of of to me but now watch see I believe
[44:58] your child training has been going on
[45:00] right right all right the last couple of
[45:03] messages I stress heavily on the basis
[45:07] that we're looking back to what somebody
[45:10] done some experience some Pentecost our
[45:14] brother brandom you know and his
[45:16] ministries Etc and trying to compare
[45:19] what's going on now with that right well
[45:22] now brother Rand said that was wrong
[45:24] because he said you're looking back and
[45:26] only the frog look back all right but
[45:28] now see we can throw that basis but he
[45:30] said it's just as bad to look
[45:33] forward cuz there is no future you know
[45:36] tomorrow is not here yet all right but
[45:39] see we're looking for something great to
[45:42] happen and forgetting what's taking
[45:45] place now that's what your Prophet said
[45:48] about it he said that was the biggest
[45:49] mistake mankind had made well I call it
[45:51] the denominational mixup because that's
[45:54] what's exactly the Antichrist is trying
[45:56] to do
[45:57] he's trying to get us to look back he
[45:59] ain't saying this message is wrong
[46:02] right you notice that in the P I'm this
[46:05] is getting something to you if you
[46:06] notice in the past u 10 years all right
[46:12] you know that we had little problems and
[46:14] we'd have a little FL up here a little
[46:15] dude here and they they try to attack
[46:17] the message just
[46:19] way and they try to attack the message
[46:21] that way and they would make fun of us
[46:23] and but if you notice you hadn't paid
[46:25] attention in about maybe 10 10 years or
[46:27] maybe even
[46:28] longer you know we're becoming one of
[46:33] them I told you 10 15 20 years ago I
[46:37] said you let this thing go on and one
[46:40] day we'll be one of the biggest
[46:41] denominations there is cuz there's
[46:44] Millions around the world there's
[46:47] probably over a million in
[46:50] Africa that claims this
[46:53] message thank God
[46:57] for
[46:58] everyone and see we can say fear not
[47:01] little flock see we use that for our own
[47:04] doing but remember it's always we say
[47:07] little flock that means we and the rest
[47:09] of
[47:10] you that's like man up in South Carolina
[47:13] years ago he didn't believe in having
[47:15] relationship with your
[47:17] wife boy he preached against you know
[47:19] why he's 80 years
[47:22] old I'm
[47:24] playing why worry about that's right see
[47:28] you know but you see there always like I
[47:31] said if you're not little flock that
[47:34] means me in a little
[47:37] Mount well why not I want everybody in
[47:39] the world save I know they won't
[47:42] be but I want it for
[47:45] them I like the way brother R made it he
[47:48] said the third pull is for the bride and
[47:51] the church read your quote and to the
[47:54] totally lost we want to say for the
[47:56] bride to the totally lost you better
[47:58] read your
[47:59] quote cuz see even the foolish virgin
[48:01] getting in her place and things like
[48:03] that is the opening of God's
[48:06] word all right now but I'm just trying
[48:08] to get you to a point of looking at it
[48:10] see I believe something's been going on
[48:11] for the past 40 something years since
[48:14] the prophet has
[48:15] left all right now I just got to explain
[48:19] it if you receive the Holy Ghost today
[48:21] that's when you're starting your tutor
[48:23] and training but if you receive the Holy
[48:24] Ghost 50 years ago you've been in
[48:26] training and
[48:30] tutoring now you you understand what I'm
[48:32] saying that's been what's been going
[48:35] on well why can't we look at it like
[48:38] that to say something is going on
[48:40] instead of saying we don't see nothing
[48:42] going on but back under now oh yes back
[48:47] there well that's what the Bible said
[48:49] people would say had we been back
[48:53] there people have said to me you know if
[48:55] I'd have been back there with Jesus they
[48:57] wouldn't have crucified him I'd have
[49:00] fought well what are you doing now
[49:04] right see what we're doing now Pro what
[49:06] we would have done dinner we'll do later
[49:08] right see tomorrow rest upon what we
[49:11] have
[49:12] today but God is ever present the you
[49:15] know the I am which means ever
[49:18] presentent for
[49:19] eternity and see that's the point we got
[49:21] to do now remember I kept stressing it
[49:24] see we're looking for something to
[49:26] happen are looking back to what has
[49:28] happened and see of still of seeing
[49:30] what's going
[49:32] on and when I sitting there an office
[49:34] while I go thinking I try my best to
[49:36] explain things but in doing that I get
[49:39] in
[49:41] trouble I've tried my best to explain
[49:43] this message and got in
[49:45] trouble cuz people think I'm just an
[49:47] intellectual person that's explaining it
[49:52] intellectually and when I say that you
[49:54] bring Paul and Peter and them down here
[49:56] to where we are and they'd be glad to
[49:59] say let me go back to the Grave cuz they
[50:01] didn't fight fight didn't face 969
[50:05] different denominations in 2000 in this
[50:07] message amen they only faced the
[50:10] Sadducees Pharisees and maybe a couple
[50:13] little sling offs right they didn't have
[50:16] the 200,000,000
[50:18] demons right according to what they say
[50:21] I reckon that's 200 million well if
[50:22] there 200 million in this message we all
[50:24] got an extra demon besid all the demons
[50:27] we already
[50:28] had right but you see everybody wants to
[50:33] look back or look
[50:34] forward see I I've been looking at this
[50:37] for 40 something years of the child
[50:39] training the tutoring I preached on
[50:42] these things down through the years see
[50:45] it's been the time that you and I had to
[50:47] have yes see without child training you
[50:52] can't go up to a Transfiguration
[50:54] experience that's what everybody wants
[50:56] boy I get boy I get when I got born
[50:58] again I just man I got everything I'm
[50:59] ready to go I'm just waiting on
[51:02] y'all yeah well a lot of y'all is
[51:06] gone that was waiting on
[51:10] us but now listen I tried to make my
[51:12] point to
[51:14] this the prophet of God said and I
[51:17] didn't give you the quote on this one
[51:18] now but it's on who is this melz
[51:21] 1965 he said the
[51:25] predestinated is the only ones
[51:27] considered in Redemption right amen all
[51:32] right now he says the Royal Seed of
[51:35] Abraham is the only ones considered All
[51:38] right so God don't adopt the devil's
[51:42] children right but he has to give us the
[51:45] new birth to make us his
[51:47] children oh we're all son yeah we're all
[51:49] Sons and Daughters because God gave us
[51:52] life that's natural that's what I said a
[51:55] while ago Jesus went a natural adoption
[51:57] at somewhere maybe around 13 years of
[51:59] age or something because it was a custom
[52:02] but that didn't stop him from having to
[52:04] go through the River Jordan the Mount of
[52:05] transfiguration and the crucifixion and
[52:09] Resurrection see one of them was a
[52:11] natural thing the other one is a
[52:13] spiritual thing all right and see we're
[52:15] born again into the family of God yes to
[52:19] bring us to being God's
[52:21] children
[52:22] see all right but see I know what the
[52:25] quotes are the people of the message oh
[52:26] I always was
[52:28] eternal well
[52:30] then why don't you take and I'll
[52:33] happy I know I'm arrogant and hateful
[52:36] and mean but I I'll borrow money to help
[52:38] send you in that next spaceship that
[52:40] goes up into those Rockets it goes up
[52:42] you know because we don't need you
[52:45] here you know if you're already packed
[52:47] up ready to go up we'll just have to
[52:48] send you
[52:49] up you said well that's silly well maybe
[52:51] it is but don't get the point across
[52:53] you'll remember what I said amen cuz I
[52:55] believe you got be born again to have
[52:57] eternal
[52:59] life the prophet you say he said I
[53:01] always was eternal you better read the
[53:03] rest of the message called in the same
[53:06] message he said if you have eternal
[53:10] life you always was
[53:12] eternal that's what we'll to get to but
[53:14] see people don't like that they want
[53:16] quotes that make them feel good you know
[53:20] they don't want the truth of the Gospel
[53:21] amen but the prophet said the
[53:23] predestinated was the only ones
[53:25] considered in redemp
[53:26] all right see then we must become as I
[53:29] Tred my best to bring to you by the
[53:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit the new birth
[53:34] we become the children of God and
[53:37] receiving the holy spirit that Holy
[53:39] Spirit is our tutor which is the spirit
[53:42] of the father right this is not a
[53:44] natural story of God hiring somebody a
[53:47] second person sending them to you to to
[53:50] tutter you it's the Holy Spirit which is
[53:52] God himself Comes Back in the New Birth
[53:54] the prophet said your new birth is
[53:55] father son the Holy Ghost in you in the
[53:59] New
[54:00] Birth well I thought it was well what
[54:02] you thought Ain Worth to sense and what
[54:04] I thought ain't either all right now let
[54:06] me just state it this
[54:09] way see then the adoption truly starts
[54:13] at the new
[54:15] birth but it only will it'll be
[54:18] completed only when the Redemption is
[54:21] finished you know and and we're we're
[54:23] the bodies are changed and we become to
[54:27] immortality all right see that's just
[54:29] like I I've always taught you and you
[54:31] know it I've taught you the new birth
[54:33] starts the day you receive the eternal
[54:34] life right but it'll finish the day you
[54:37] receive an eternal body this body made
[54:40] Eternal will be the new birth
[54:42] finished all right so is adoption it
[54:45] starts with a new birth it is completed
[54:47] when we leave out of here all right so
[54:49] we're in the process see of it taking
[54:53] place see now wait this evening when we
[54:55] give some other definitions no but we
[54:57] know that according to Romans 8 like
[55:01] verse
[55:03] 19 that the whole world has been waiting
[55:07] on the manifestation of the sons of God
[55:11] right now I want to ask you something
[55:14] about
[55:15] that that means whole creation it means
[55:18] animals World trees it means
[55:20] everything's waiting right cuz it said
[55:23] you know the creation the world and all
[55:26] do you think the world's want to come to
[55:27] an
[55:29] end now I'm asking you a simple question
[55:32] to change do you think the world is
[55:34] wanting to come to an end do you think
[55:36] the animals is wanting the world to be
[55:39] annihilated do you think the trees are
[55:41] wanting to gr the creation you think
[55:43] that that see when we read that we just
[55:45] look at it the whole world
[55:48] waiting it's not waiting for the
[55:51] finality the world's not groaning for
[55:54] the finality that's right right
[55:56] the dead that's in the grave is not
[55:58] wanting the finality it's wanting
[56:00] manifested Sons and Daughters of God to
[56:03] be here that can call them out of the
[56:05] grave and bring them back to standing
[56:08] here on
[56:09] Earth not an Annihilation right see we
[56:14] just take something and just well the
[56:15] whole world's waiting want to be
[56:17] something what days the world get happy
[56:19] he won't be happy when it's going
[56:21] through a burning over that's right all
[56:24] the animals and things are being
[56:25] destroyed and all that's not what it is
[56:26] it's waiting for the
[56:30] manifestation waiting for a group of
[56:32] people to recognize who they are right
[56:35] here because I believe in eternal life
[56:38] here I've never Tau you anything up in
[56:40] heaven that we got to go there what I
[56:42] said that you you go too far that way
[56:44] you go too far that way don't do any one
[56:46] get what here according to my Bible and
[56:49] the prophet I've studied out for 40
[56:51] something years now I thought we was
[56:53] going to be changing them on the
[56:55] twinkling eye right here
[56:58] I thought we was ahead of the world in
[57:00] the basis of where that our Redemption
[57:02] would be completed here and we would
[57:03] step into eternal life that's right and
[57:06] the world will go
[57:09] on it'll go for at least another three
[57:11] and 1 half years right cuz he really get
[57:13] the message when we leave out of here
[57:15] all right see want to worry about
[57:18] it but my point is I've triy to I keep
[57:21] putting it in here don't look
[57:25] backward to other people and things and
[57:28] try to judge what's going on think about
[57:31] what would happen if you brought those
[57:33] people down to this situation right that
[57:35] you and I are existing under when the
[57:38] prophet of God said the
[57:40] spirit of them that died and gave their
[57:43] lives under the lines and the things
[57:45] like that he said it's the same Spirit
[57:48] you use daily just to
[57:52] overcome he said it was easy to walk up
[57:55] and sound a Christian then they kill
[57:58] them but see everybody's Christian now
[58:00] that's right yeah oh we just want to
[58:04] change it and make different names out
[58:05] of it Muslim Hindus and this that new
[58:08] whatever you
[58:10] know because nobody's lost we all got a
[58:13] happy hunting
[58:16] ground but see we're not to look back to
[58:19] what some people is doing to compare
[58:21] what's God is doing neither are we to
[58:23] look forward to Something That We're
[58:26] expecting to come which we are expecting
[58:28] that but we're not we can't get over
[58:31] there right
[58:33] right see I want to get on that but I
[58:35] got this message and one in between and
[58:37] and then I'll try to get down to the
[58:39] headstone and the situation and what
[58:41] we're looking
[58:42] at but now
[58:45] listen the prophet has brought the
[58:48] message but the people must take the
[58:52] message and make the message alive right
[58:56] you agree yes that's what it's waiting
[58:59] on and the Bible doesn't say that that
[59:01] you know that the whole world is growing
[59:03] waiting for Meli for in the bases of say
[59:06] just brother brandom now read your Bible
[59:08] it's waiting for the manifestation of
[59:10] the sons of God plural not
[59:13] singular not just waiting for Brother
[59:15] brandom now we know for certainty
[59:16] without him coming first there would be
[59:18] no hope for you and I be anything and I
[59:21] told you there the other day and say it
[59:22] over and over the creation for a moment
[59:26] in brother Rand saw their
[59:30] Master cuz they saw a man that could
[59:33] stand there and God would back up his
[59:34] Worden amen all right now but you see
[59:39] look what your Prophet had to say on
[59:41] Christ the Myster of God
[59:43] revealed he says our headship is a
[59:45] kingdom this preached 1963 728 which is
[59:48] Page uh
[59:50] 76 but let get to the part at the bottom
[59:53] there 76 see the kingdom of God is
[59:56] within you the Bible says the kingdom we
[59:58] are not a denomination we belong to a
[1:00:00] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[1:00:03] God made spirit and life in her own life
[1:00:05] bring to PA every promise in this day as
[1:00:08] it did in that day this day as it did in
[1:00:12] that day once when the word and God was
[1:00:16] one okay that was in Jesus Christ right
[1:00:20] all right now watch and the word and God
[1:00:22] is one in his church today right now
[1:00:26] listen didn't it say The Prophet said in
[1:00:27] his church making it the headship of the
[1:00:31] body that is redeemed to bring the
[1:00:33] message in the last days and be taken up
[1:00:38] from the dead in the resurrection to go
[1:00:41] back and restore again as Adam and Eve
[1:00:43] in the beginning at the Garden of
[1:00:46] Eden so what's the world waiting
[1:00:49] on manifestation of Sons and Daughters
[1:00:52] of God right to where that they'll come
[1:00:55] that head and body can unite
[1:00:59] yes now I'll go ahead and tell it to you
[1:01:02] then I'll preach it to you wait a few
[1:01:03] weeks down the road see to me The
[1:01:05] Headstone is what you receive at the
[1:01:08] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[1:01:10] of God as an example of amount of
[1:01:12] transfiguration experience that's right
[1:01:14] see that's why it hasn't happened
[1:01:17] because it has to be in every bride
[1:01:20] member for it to come forth into its
[1:01:23] fullness I don't to be sensible right
[1:01:27] but I'll get to that later see but he
[1:01:29] said that that it's that making the
[1:01:32] headship of the body that is redeemed to
[1:01:35] bring the message well I thought they
[1:01:37] would nothing left that brother Brown
[1:01:39] left it's
[1:01:43] not the people in Luther's day didn't
[1:01:45] add one word to what Luther said they
[1:01:48] had more a whole lot more
[1:01:50] mechanics right right more people
[1:01:54] amen and more getting into the word but
[1:01:57] they never added a word I offended them
[1:01:59] in a minist me one time I said when them
[1:02:01] seal broke to me in in 1979 I said and
[1:02:05] all through there I said you ain't added
[1:02:06] one word to what I
[1:02:08] said boy they didn't like it but I still
[1:02:11] stand with it
[1:02:13] today I didn't say nobody had to
[1:02:15] preached more than I did I would have
[1:02:16] not even thought of it see that's where
[1:02:18] I say something then if I don't explain
[1:02:20] it I get into trouble then when I do
[1:02:22] explain it I get into trouble so I'm in
[1:02:24] trouble
[1:02:26] this called me
[1:02:27] trouble all but you see what it's doing
[1:02:31] you how much have I tried to emphasize
[1:02:32] can you recognize your day in this
[1:02:35] message amen well yeah we yeah what see
[1:02:39] I'm po not all right people don't take
[1:02:41] or anything I'm pointing in One
[1:02:42] Direction like yeah we're looking back
[1:02:44] yeah we're looking back we're looking at
[1:02:46] what brother
[1:02:47] brandom all right wonderful thank
[1:02:52] God but I thought he was pointing to you
[1:02:54] and I
[1:02:57] amen I thought according to believe in
[1:02:59] the church AG book he said this Prophet
[1:03:01] would be pointing to
[1:03:03] the a word born
[1:03:07] right I said Martin Luther see it wasn't
[1:03:11] Martin Luther that put that thing that
[1:03:14] made him get that to going it wasn't his
[1:03:16] 90s something thesis nailed on the door
[1:03:19] that made it get out it was the people
[1:03:21] that begin to live the message Martin
[1:03:23] Luther was preaching then the cathol
[1:03:25] Church got worried they wasn't worried
[1:03:27] about one man they could excommunicate
[1:03:29] him cut his head off leave him
[1:03:31] gone but when the people started getting
[1:03:34] the
[1:03:36] message so it is is an end time and the
[1:03:39] bride begins to realize the prophet said
[1:03:41] who she
[1:03:42] is didn't say when the prophet realized
[1:03:45] who he is he knew who he
[1:03:48] was all right well what are we to
[1:03:52] do see
[1:03:56] so we've been in a child training
[1:03:58] period you said well it look like we
[1:04:00] ought to be cained by now well you know
[1:04:03] when you make that statement you are the
[1:04:06] one that hasn't been trained that's
[1:04:09] right is that blunt enough right nobody
[1:04:11] got a problem with what I just
[1:04:13] said if you got that thought then that
[1:04:16] means you're the one I'm talking about
[1:04:17] you're the one that hasn't taken the
[1:04:19] child training and let it develop you
[1:04:21] that's
[1:04:22] right because you wouldn't be saying it
[1:04:24] like that that's right
[1:04:26] see cuz you would be saying hey like I
[1:04:28] told you about the two brothers that one
[1:04:30] said he got all the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:32] everything when he was born again other
[1:04:33] said you ain't got nothing yet and I
[1:04:34] said Brothers I'm just somewhere in the
[1:04:36] middle well you know when I tried to
[1:04:37] explain a quote to
[1:04:40] them both of them ridicule me for
[1:04:43] banking it brother brandom said he met
[1:04:45] people that receive the Holy Ghost 50
[1:04:47] years before him exactly like the day of
[1:04:51] Pentecost that's a direct
[1:04:54] quote you know that both of them
[1:04:56] ridicule me for the answer I
[1:04:59] gave but what's the answer you know cuz
[1:05:01] you've been taught it that there's a
[1:05:04] difference in the upper room experience
[1:05:05] of three three you know the 120 in the
[1:05:10] upper room and the 3,000 down Stars 120
[1:05:12] in the upper room went to the faith of
[1:05:14] the fathers they received the Holy
[1:05:16] Spirit right here
[1:05:19] amen but on the day of Pentecost they
[1:05:21] received the Holy Spirit right
[1:05:24] here that's a simple answer right but
[1:05:28] both of them ridiculed me neither one of
[1:05:29] them took what was
[1:05:31] said see nobody else want either but
[1:05:33] there's one thing about it it's dark
[1:05:35] right amen now I've tried to explain so
[1:05:39] I'm going to give you an
[1:05:41] example I've tried to explain our child
[1:05:45] training you know through life I've
[1:05:48] tried to explain that even
[1:05:49] Jesus in his natural life he had child
[1:05:53] training right you yet he was almighty
[1:05:56] God cuz the Bible said he went home with
[1:05:58] him and was subject that's when he was
[1:06:00] like 13 years old when he was over you
[1:06:02] know with the the uh the doctors and the
[1:06:05] lawyers talking to them about 13
[1:06:07] somewhere what he was 16 whatever year
[1:06:09] you
[1:06:10] got the Bible said he went home and was
[1:06:13] subject under
[1:06:14] them he had child training
[1:06:18] right see that was what so hard to me
[1:06:20] because I couldn't just I couldn't get
[1:06:22] him figured out I guess I was too much
[1:06:23] of a Oneness maybe but I just couldn't
[1:06:26] see that he could hurt himself cuz he
[1:06:27] was
[1:06:28] God I'm sorry that's what I used to
[1:06:31] think you know I thought he was God and
[1:06:33] he was but I thought he couldn't fall
[1:06:35] and hurt himself you know he start to
[1:06:37] fall an angel and just lift him up and
[1:06:40] you know and the little kid running
[1:06:41] along he he stumbled you know like look
[1:06:43] how many little kids of you fall one
[1:06:46] fell got the door hung today on the foot
[1:06:48] and everything you
[1:06:49] know I don't believe that I'm
[1:06:53] sorry I'm glad God opened my eyes
[1:06:56] I believe he went through
[1:06:59] days of life right as a
[1:07:05] child brother random went through it yes
[1:07:08] why wouldn't we believe Jesus he said he
[1:07:10] cut his mama's rug up and hung up in the
[1:07:12] tree and holled for
[1:07:14] T
[1:07:18] right why couldn't we believe that Jesus
[1:07:20] went through
[1:07:22] that you know he had to nurse his mother
[1:07:24] you know he did just come into the world
[1:07:26] and just lay there and never he used the
[1:07:29] bathroom he had to be GI trained for
[1:07:31] potty you know training and all this
[1:07:34] that the
[1:07:36] other but you
[1:07:38] see when it come up to the about 13
[1:07:41] years of age cuz that's somewhere in
[1:07:45] that 13 15 16 whatever you want make it
[1:07:47] when he come to that place that he was
[1:07:48] with the Pharisees okay you know that
[1:07:52] there's
[1:07:53] like you know
[1:07:56] right at 15 years or
[1:07:59] something between there and his time of
[1:08:02] appearing on the River
[1:08:04] Jordan you know that's called The Silent
[1:08:08] years there's no writings of what he
[1:08:11] done there's fictitional things brought
[1:08:15] up you know that he done this the book
[1:08:16] of macbes and all of the different
[1:08:18] things but they call it the silent
[1:08:21] years because it wasn't anything written
[1:08:24] amen but now I guess you think well he's
[1:08:27] just well I'll be glad the next year
[1:08:29] gets here I'll be glad the next year
[1:08:31] gets here I I want get up and go do
[1:08:34] something now that's just F silly you
[1:08:37] say you're silly I know what I am but it
[1:08:39] gets a point
[1:08:42] across he went through child
[1:08:46] training he went through life yes and
[1:08:50] see for 40 something years we've been
[1:08:52] going through child training yes
[1:08:56] M
[1:08:59] right that's what's been going on that's
[1:09:01] why that's why it it hurts me when
[1:09:04] people say nothing ain't going
[1:09:07] on oh if it was just like it was back
[1:09:10] there even in a zeusa street we'll get
[1:09:13] to that in a
[1:09:14] minute we'll see whether you're right or
[1:09:17] not look get the
[1:09:20] point we've been going through a child
[1:09:22] training period that's right and it's
[1:09:25] been in the silent
[1:09:27] years but you can't say that here about
[1:09:30] everything because God has been on the
[1:09:31] scene here for a lot of things that we
[1:09:34] could talk about all day
[1:09:36] right many miracles many signs Many
[1:09:40] Wonders dead raay sick heel I used to
[1:09:42] say I'd seen everything but the dead
[1:09:44] raised and the eyes open the only thing
[1:09:46] I want to see now is blinded eyes open
[1:09:48] because I've seen the dead raised and I
[1:09:50] ain't worried about the rest of
[1:09:52] it so well it might okay
[1:09:56] why would you doubt
[1:09:58] it what's the
[1:10:01] problem all
[1:10:03] right but now listen there was plenty
[1:10:06] going on in Jesus's
[1:10:11] life from the time he was there with
[1:10:14] those you know talking to the Pharisees
[1:10:16] and the things it's called The Silent
[1:10:19] years but it wasn't God wasn't silent he
[1:10:21] was living his life that's right he was
[1:10:25] was doing great things his mother must
[1:10:27] have had so much confidence until when
[1:10:30] it comes to where that he first begins
[1:10:32] to appear she tells them about the wine
[1:10:36] you know the whatever he tells you do do
[1:10:40] it she might have seen a lot of things
[1:10:43] took place you
[1:10:45] know cuz I don't think he was just
[1:10:47] sitting around and wasn't doing I
[1:10:48] believe there was sick being healed all
[1:10:51] kind of things was happening in his life
[1:10:53] that he could just go and lay hands on
[1:10:54] somebody
[1:10:56] while it was coming up through that
[1:10:57] period of
[1:10:58] time all right I hope you get the
[1:11:00] example it's called The Silent years so
[1:11:03] if we want to call that the silent years
[1:11:05] or 40 something years since the prophet
[1:11:07] left the
[1:11:08] scene I still say something's been going
[1:11:11] on Amen it's been our opportunity to get
[1:11:14] settled in the
[1:11:18] word it's done a lot of church
[1:11:22] changing a lot of people's come here
[1:11:25] a lot of people's left
[1:11:27] here all right I don't say anything I'll
[1:11:31] just go ahead and tell you this cuz some
[1:11:32] of you wonder anyway brother Arline
[1:11:34] called me the other day and said he
[1:11:35] won't be back at church he's going down
[1:11:37] to brother mgar is
[1:11:39] okay that's I told I you big
[1:11:42] boy he said nothing wrong with the
[1:11:44] church said it's my private matters
[1:11:49] no that's that's your choice but you see
[1:11:53] I don't say people's off the word
[1:11:55] because leave here only thing I've ever
[1:11:57] said if you leave here and you find more
[1:11:58] than what we got here let me know where
[1:11:59] I can go
[1:12:02] eat you said you wouldn't do it well try
[1:12:06] me at least there's one thing about it
[1:12:08] we'll get the Tes but now
[1:12:10] listen see Jesus was a child a natural
[1:12:16] child and he came to a
[1:12:19] natural adoption into that family
[1:12:22] according to what their Traditions were
[1:12:26] but then when it come to the River
[1:12:28] Jordan he started a spiritual
[1:12:32] condition not a
[1:12:36] natural a spiritual
[1:12:39] condition that started with him you know
[1:12:42] going forth and being identified now I
[1:12:45] preached that to you right right see and
[1:12:48] then I said when we receive the new
[1:12:50] birth we're identified right cuz we're
[1:12:53] in a spiritual Kingdom right
[1:12:56] our headship we read Christ the Myster
[1:12:58] God revealed our headship is the
[1:13:01] kingdom what is that King the spirit of
[1:13:04] God living in us that's right
[1:13:08] now you see the spiritual Kingdom our
[1:13:10] spiritual adoption started when Jesus
[1:13:13] received his River Jordan experience and
[1:13:15] it starts with you and
[1:13:18] I in the New Birth because when Jesus
[1:13:22] received there and the quotes are there
[1:13:24] we agree with it 100% the prophet said
[1:13:26] he became the fullest of the godhead
[1:13:28] bodily on the River
[1:13:30] Jordan I agree with that 1,00% because
[1:13:33] see that would put then a him in a
[1:13:37] position that he could teach
[1:13:39] us as he grow that's right
[1:13:44] right are you listening as he
[1:13:47] grow because the Bible says the
[1:13:50] husbandman must be first partaker of the
[1:13:52] fruit so as Jesus grow in in the the the
[1:13:56] new experience of coming forth on the
[1:13:59] day of of his baptismal service he
[1:14:02] didn't have to have that we know the
[1:14:04] story he didn't have to receive the new
[1:14:07] birth we know the story he was the New
[1:14:10] Birth
[1:14:12] amen but yet what he done he went
[1:14:15] through that as examples for us
[1:14:18] right see then he went to the most
[1:14:21] horrible training to The Backs side of
[1:14:22] the desert for 40 days and nights
[1:14:25] without water or food and you can't go
[1:14:28] without water here in this climate where
[1:14:31] we're at you can't go down to the swamps
[1:14:33] and sit down in the swamps and live for
[1:14:36] 40 days without drinking water
[1:14:40] right so it proved you had to be
[1:14:42] almighty
[1:14:43] God cuz you want according to the Bible
[1:14:45] of course you can argue about it as well
[1:14:47] I don't know whether that was well okay
[1:14:48] argue about it do what you want to you
[1:14:50] diging your own hole
[1:14:52] anyway but you see the Bible said 40 40
[1:14:55] days and 40 nights with no water no
[1:15:00] food started his training
[1:15:03] then from that
[1:15:06] experience he started his
[1:15:09] training the Holy Spirit was
[1:15:12] there to bring forth the message that
[1:15:15] was needed we start our training his
[1:15:18] lasted for about 3 years and then he
[1:15:20] goes to the Mount of
[1:15:22] transfiguration our training has been
[1:15:24] over 40 years
[1:15:26] years to bring us to a place that we
[1:15:29] start with our new birth and then we
[1:15:31] must be come to the place of
[1:15:35] adoption you know eventually we will
[1:15:37] receive that see we receive the new
[1:15:40] birth which is the spiritual Kingdom to
[1:15:41] make us a child of God the holy spirit
[1:15:44] being the tutor begins the process of
[1:15:47] adoption now put that down it begins a
[1:15:51] process not a completion a
[1:15:53] process a process means you just step
[1:15:56] into whatever is moving or doing you
[1:15:58] know and you're going forward that's a
[1:15:59] process I don't mean it's complete see
[1:16:03] but what I want us to see
[1:16:05] is that we have been going through that
[1:16:07] process since we received the new
[1:16:10] birth
[1:16:12] right all right most of you that are
[1:16:15] here other than the young ones coming
[1:16:17] along would say you receive the Holy
[1:16:19] Spirit maybe what 20 30 40 years
[1:16:22] ago maybe some of you would even say 50
[1:16:25] years ago or
[1:16:27] more well all right you started the
[1:16:31] process to prove that it was the Holy
[1:16:34] Spirit you came to the message
[1:16:38] amen some of us receive the Holy Spirit
[1:16:41] after coming into the message that don't
[1:16:42] change anything but it's it's still
[1:16:45] whether or not we agree with the
[1:16:46] word amen
[1:16:50] now so something's been going on that's
[1:16:53] right to me was the most important thing
[1:16:56] that could ever be is the child training
[1:16:58] of our
[1:17:01] journey yes people say they got more out
[1:17:04] there they got more okay let's see what
[1:17:06] God says about
[1:17:07] it see now don't miss
[1:17:10] it remember don't look back and don't
[1:17:13] look forward look at what's being
[1:17:17] done I write it down so I just read it
[1:17:19] to you the people say I don't see much
[1:17:21] going on
[1:17:24] why them denominations have more signs
[1:17:27] than we
[1:17:29] do as a whole I agree with
[1:17:33] you I said as a whole I did a whole lot
[1:17:36] more of
[1:17:38] them right only is that
[1:17:41] purpose see but that's part of your
[1:17:44] child
[1:17:48] training now we're going to get real
[1:17:50] serious here about something that you
[1:17:52] better
[1:17:53] think cuz if you don't you're going to
[1:17:55] be in
[1:17:57] trouble
[1:17:59] right see part of our child
[1:18:02] training is to what to see if we will
[1:18:05] stay with the
[1:18:06] word is that your trial training that a
[1:18:09] child training to see whether you'll
[1:18:11] stay with the
[1:18:12] word no it's a nature of the
[1:18:16] F God to help
[1:18:20] us we become educated idiots
[1:18:26] I want to ask you a
[1:18:30] question see the part of our child
[1:18:32] training is whether or not we'll stay
[1:18:33] with the word or father signs and
[1:18:36] wonders but I want to ask you a serious
[1:18:38] question right
[1:18:41] there who does the signs and
[1:18:46] wonders no man can
[1:18:49] heal I don't care who he is brother
[1:18:51] brand who it was even Jesus couldn't
[1:18:53] heal right he could speak the word
[1:18:57] right now that's not agreeing with
[1:18:59] brother so and so that says J oh no the
[1:19:02] son of man had power to forgive sins he
[1:19:04] had power to heal but it's because he
[1:19:07] spoke the word amen okay all right now
[1:19:12] who is doing the signs and
[1:19:16] wonders no matter where it is whether it
[1:19:18] be in the body of Christ or where it be
[1:19:20] around the world or where it be the pope
[1:19:21] laying his hands on people or where it
[1:19:23] be in the Beatles with their songs and
[1:19:24] people people getting up and
[1:19:29] walking okay come on you're supposed to
[1:19:32] be understanding what I'm getting at
[1:19:33] who's doing it God is doing it if
[1:19:36] anybody's everever healed anywhere God
[1:19:37] heals them
[1:19:40] right sure when The Beatles got it bited
[1:19:43] up in a row the people forgot themselves
[1:19:45] and jumped up and run off walking but if
[1:19:47] God was the one that done the
[1:19:50] healing right all right then get it down
[1:19:54] right
[1:19:55] so if God is doing the
[1:19:59] healing he must be really doing what we
[1:20:02] read in a in a
[1:20:04] Peter that all these things is to try us
[1:20:09] that's right to see if we'll stay with
[1:20:12] the
[1:20:14] word God is doing the healing that's
[1:20:18] right to try you and me that's right
[1:20:26] people say well we ain't got as much as
[1:20:28] the be we can't work up to people enough
[1:20:31] to get them healed well it wouldn't
[1:20:33] matter if we
[1:20:34] could God is the only healer there
[1:20:38] is all
[1:20:40] right now get the point what I'm getting
[1:20:43] at I'm trying to lay down something see
[1:20:45] God is trying his church that's right
[1:20:48] he's been doing that for 40 something
[1:20:50] years he's been trying us to see if we'd
[1:20:51] stay with the word amen
[1:20:56] right see he's trying his church turn
[1:20:58] with me over in
[1:21:01] Deuteronomy and let's see how God tries
[1:21:04] his
[1:21:08] children think we love to read that in
[1:21:10] Deuteronomy or the scriptures there
[1:21:11] where says if a prophet give a sign and
[1:21:13] it come to P we're supposed to believe
[1:21:14] the prophet
[1:21:15] amen but what about this
[1:21:18] scripture Deuteronomy
[1:21:20] 13 what about this
[1:21:23] scripture let's see what God says he's
[1:21:25] doing we read over there in Peter that
[1:21:28] he was trying us with the things let's
[1:21:31] see how he does
[1:21:34] it everybody got it Deuteronomy 13:1 if
[1:21:37] there arise among you a prophet or a
[1:21:40] dreamer of dreams and give thee a sign
[1:21:43] or a Wonder now listen and the sign or
[1:21:47] the Wonder come to
[1:21:50] pass now you understand what that means
[1:21:53] sobody to get up tell you I want to show
[1:21:55] you that I am of God cuz there's 10 dead
[1:21:57] people laying right here in front of me
[1:21:59] and I'm going to speak the word and
[1:22:00] they're going to raise up and they do
[1:22:02] now what you going to
[1:22:04] do I'm going to praise God for the
[1:22:08] raising but I got to do something else
[1:22:10] about the guy that's doing
[1:22:12] it I just run that's what people do see
[1:22:15] get a little something going in the
[1:22:16] message and boy they just run after they
[1:22:18] just run after it they run after this
[1:22:20] run after
[1:22:22] that and it's the same people running
[1:22:24] here same people that run there they run
[1:22:27] after this in a while then they run
[1:22:28] after that in a while that's right well
[1:22:30] we got it we got it we got it then you
[1:22:33] just oh we got it we got
[1:22:37] it now you know it's
[1:22:39] true you been around anytime you know
[1:22:42] it's to you want to call names listen if
[1:22:46] there arise among you a prophet or a
[1:22:47] dreamer of dreams and he and giveth thee
[1:22:50] a sign or a wonder and the sign or the
[1:22:52] Wonder come to pass where on he spake
[1:22:55] unto thee saying
[1:22:58] listen let us go after other
[1:23:02] gods which thou has not known and let us
[1:23:05] serve
[1:23:06] them you remember in in when the
[1:23:09] children of Israel was down there you
[1:23:10] remember what old Dayan and cor and then
[1:23:13] was going to do they made that golden
[1:23:16] cast you know they going to take that
[1:23:18] golden cast I never did believe I'm just
[1:23:20] plain language I never did believe it
[1:23:22] going back to Egypt to be slave they
[1:23:25] going back to Egypts as Victorious and
[1:23:27] they going to say he was afraid of us
[1:23:29] look what happened under Moses we got to
[1:23:34] God they had a
[1:23:36] plan they know what you're doing we said
[1:23:39] let us go after other gods which thou
[1:23:42] Hast not known and let us serve them
[1:23:44] Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of
[1:23:46] that Prophet are that dreamer a dream
[1:23:48] for the Lord your God prove with you to
[1:23:52] know whether you love the Lord your God
[1:23:54] with with all your heart with all your
[1:23:56] soul you shall walk after the Lord your
[1:23:59] God and fear Him and keep his
[1:24:00] Commandments and obey his voice and you
[1:24:03] shall serve him and cleave unto him yes
[1:24:06] now God gives you a sign he raises 10
[1:24:09] dead people what are you going to
[1:24:13] do boy he's got to be right
[1:24:16] no you got to check him now how you
[1:24:20] going to check him well I'll check him
[1:24:22] by this other guy that raised 20 people
[1:24:24] from the
[1:24:27] dead now don't don't
[1:24:29] be I know I play around when I say
[1:24:32] things like that and try to make it hard
[1:24:33] but I make it as a point turn over
[1:24:35] Deuteronomy 18 let's see how you check
[1:24:38] it let's see what God says for you to
[1:24:45] do anybody got it Deuteronomy 18 verse
[1:24:49] 20 but the prophet which shall presume
[1:24:52] to speak a word in my name which I have
[1:24:56] not commanded him to speak or that shall
[1:25:00] speak in the name of other gods even
[1:25:03] that Prophet shall
[1:25:05] die
[1:25:07] listen how are you going to know the
[1:25:09] difference okay let's read and if thou
[1:25:12] say in thine
[1:25:14] heart how shall we know the word which
[1:25:18] the Lord ha not
[1:25:20] spoken in other words how are we going
[1:25:23] to know whether whether this is of God
[1:25:25] or
[1:25:27] not
[1:25:29] right the man spoke it come to
[1:25:31] P how are you going to know when a
[1:25:35] prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord
[1:25:38] if the thing fall not nor come to P that
[1:25:41] is the thing which the Lord ha not
[1:25:43] spoken but the prophet has spoken it
[1:25:45] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[1:25:48] of
[1:25:49] him checking by the word amen
[1:25:55] if he's carrying you the other one was
[1:25:57] reading carries you to another
[1:25:59] God now of course in the message you're
[1:26:02] not going to hear people preach a
[1:26:06] trinity but you hear them preach two
[1:26:08] Lords and Jesus wouldn't go at the River
[1:26:11] Jordan and he think that's
[1:26:16] a smooth way of doing
[1:26:18] it you don't hear him say brother random
[1:26:21] was wrong other than maybe a few quack
[1:26:26] and one of them that teaches to Lord
[1:26:27] said he wish he hadn't wrote the things
[1:26:29] in the church AE book that he did it
[1:26:30] brother around said because he didn't
[1:26:32] agree with it now that's what he said so
[1:26:34] just go
[1:26:36] ahead see of course that's you know
[1:26:39] that's all right that's
[1:26:43] brother
[1:26:46] well God sends signs among you to try
[1:26:51] you
[1:26:54] God heals the sick out
[1:26:59] there you agreed with that come on
[1:27:01] you're know better to agree with it
[1:27:04] sometimes cuz you know I got a reason
[1:27:06] for bringing if I ever ask you to agree
[1:27:08] with it so you agreed God done the
[1:27:11] healing so what's he doing out
[1:27:14] there he's Healing The Sick Around the
[1:27:17] World today
[1:27:19] right if there's a dead person raised
[1:27:21] God doing it you know what that's for
[1:27:24] to prove he's God number
[1:27:26] one number two is to try his
[1:27:30] church to see if she will stay with the
[1:27:33] word when maybe her signs and wonders
[1:27:36] are not as amount of the
[1:27:41] others give you a sign and it come to
[1:27:44] pass but take you to another
[1:27:47] God you're not to listen to
[1:27:52] him like some fell named Lowry years ago
[1:27:56] and people were talking about him and
[1:27:58] this lady said something to my wife
[1:27:59] about it and said we can't say nothing
[1:28:02] about him he's low they believe he's God
[1:28:05] she said was he do he agree with what
[1:28:06] brother rown said said no she said well
[1:28:08] then we can say all we want to cuz he's
[1:28:10] off the
[1:28:13] word if he's off the word he's off the
[1:28:15] word I don't care who what his name
[1:28:19] is all right but I gave you a bunch of
[1:28:22] quotes from Brother brand
[1:28:27] and look what he says from fellowship
[1:28:28] which is number two on your notes 1962
[1:28:30] 5:19 got it down in the middle of it you
[1:28:33] can read all between there and see it's
[1:28:34] working okay and what I'm saying but
[1:28:36] he's talking about he was a prophet look
[1:28:39] like God turned its back on
[1:28:42] him but just to try and see if he would
[1:28:46] stay with the
[1:28:49] word it looks like God turned his back
[1:28:52] against his Prophet some a lot of times
[1:28:57] right cuz he would allow things to take
[1:29:01] place he allowed Janice and jambre not
[1:29:04] even recorded as prophets they were M
[1:29:07] what
[1:29:08] magician he allowed them to be able to
[1:29:11] bring
[1:29:14] snakes after Moses done it he allowed
[1:29:17] them to bring flies fleas frogs
[1:29:21] Etc but he wouldn't allow them to be
[1:29:24] able to take them
[1:29:26] away amen cuz if he'd been they' have
[1:29:28] been able to take him away they could
[1:29:30] have healed that's what your Prophet
[1:29:32] says that's sensible M but God allowed
[1:29:36] that what would it be something to Moses
[1:29:37] him throw his rod down that God done
[1:29:39] told him you know what to do and he told
[1:29:40] his ride down and he become a
[1:29:43] snake here Janice and Jamber just told
[1:29:46] their down they become snakes M just run
[1:29:49] back to the Wilderness here I'm
[1:29:51] going I'm going to the burning bush
[1:29:55] CU I need to know more no he just stood
[1:30:00] still that's what I've had to do many a
[1:30:03] year because people running their mouth
[1:30:04] about all of this about we ain't got
[1:30:06] this we ain't got
[1:30:09] that to keep from hurting feelings when
[1:30:12] people would preach well we don't have
[1:30:14] this we don't see the signs and miracles
[1:30:16] you think I'm rough but I've tried my
[1:30:18] best to keep a calm cool about it
[1:30:20] knowing that one
[1:30:21] day God will prove what is
[1:30:26] and when he
[1:30:29] does not where about if I'm right it' be
[1:30:33] all right if I'm wrong I a take
[1:30:37] correction but see make sure your
[1:30:39] Corrections in here that's right our
[1:30:42] life we get through all the things
[1:30:44] forget that make sure your Corrections
[1:30:46] in
[1:30:48] here all right cuz see I can read
[1:30:52] too you know but listen he said we're
[1:30:56] all tried every Christian every son
[1:30:58] every child that comes to God is Tried
[1:31:00] by the
[1:31:02] word see if you'll be loyal to it right
[1:31:06] when The Showdown comes what decision
[1:31:09] are you going to make that's it and he
[1:31:12] that cannot stand chastisement but goes
[1:31:15] on with the world he is an illegitimate
[1:31:18] child and not a son and daughter of God
[1:31:20] certainly not he said the spiritually
[1:31:21] minded catches the word right
[1:31:25] exhortation 19 E1 exhortation on
[1:31:31] healing every how you say that I guess
[1:31:33] exhortation
[1:31:35] 51501 sometimes I'll admit this that our
[1:31:38] heavenly father sometimes chastens us
[1:31:41] with
[1:31:42] sicknesses sickness permitting Satan to
[1:31:46] do
[1:31:50] it if you're ever sick God has to permit
[1:31:53] you to be sick now I've explained that
[1:31:56] and I hope it's plain and I know that's
[1:31:58] what I said try to explain something
[1:32:00] then you get in trouble we're living in
[1:32:02] a world where cold and stuff like that
[1:32:04] doesn't mean that you're lost that's
[1:32:06] right we're in a world where that's
[1:32:07] happening we're talking about de demons
[1:32:10] we're talking about other things don't
[1:32:13] say every time you get a bad Cod my
[1:32:16] sinuses run to Devils after
[1:32:18] me no that's
[1:32:21] life that's right it's sicknesses that's
[1:32:25] right
[1:32:26] M he permits that to run on into some
[1:32:30] problem permitting Satan to do it to try
[1:32:33] us sometimes to bring us back right now
[1:32:37] listen to what he says if we go out of
[1:32:40] the way then our heavenly father might
[1:32:41] let something happen to us to bring us
[1:32:45] back but it'll only be for the good see
[1:32:49] the chastening of our father is not
[1:32:51] pleasant for a season but finally it
[1:32:53] brings things all things work together
[1:32:56] for good to them that love the Lord and
[1:32:59] if if it was way away from God and out
[1:33:02] of the will of the god that was God you
[1:33:04] know it's kind of hard to stand here and
[1:33:06] say that all things work together for
[1:33:09] good when Monday I guess it was a pipe
[1:33:12] busted off in the basement most of you
[1:33:14] don't know about it and it flooded the
[1:33:15] basement June was screaming holler and
[1:33:18] bloody murder cuz she had pulled a pipe
[1:33:19] and it busted off she was doing a
[1:33:22] wonderful job pushing up crying and
[1:33:24] trying to get everybody on the phone
[1:33:25] with a trash can and putting it over in
[1:33:27] and bailing it out and we got water you
[1:33:29] know you know over a lot of the basement
[1:33:32] but we never did i' sweep it out so I
[1:33:35] had to fix the PT and I done the best I
[1:33:37] could do the best thing I could figure
[1:33:38] out to do cuz the pipes were all set and
[1:33:41] there was no way to push it up to be
[1:33:42] able to put a fitting in to make it
[1:33:45] perfect okay so I buy one of these
[1:33:48] connectors that goes in between like
[1:33:50] that with the rubber bushes on each end
[1:33:51] and you tighten it down how many of you
[1:33:53] got them in your H all right works
[1:33:56] perfect except that
[1:34:01] time we left what day was it Thursday
[1:34:05] the last thing I checked was to make
[1:34:07] sure there's no leak on
[1:34:11] it we left about 5:00 something like
[1:34:14] that went home got back up here about
[1:34:17] 9:00 when got back to the doctor wife
[1:34:19] and things
[1:34:21] and the whole basement was full of water
[1:34:25] running out the
[1:34:26] doors so you know it was
[1:34:29] deep and here we are pushing it out the
[1:34:34] door you
[1:34:36] know and having to dry it up so if you
[1:34:39] go down there and a bunch of tile it's
[1:34:40] missing just look around it's floated
[1:34:42] off somewhere else
[1:34:44] you you say well brother Dale why what
[1:34:48] went wrong what did you do or somebody
[1:34:50] do that caused that
[1:34:54] I've done the best I could do to fix the
[1:34:55] pipe I ain't figuring out what the rest
[1:34:56] of it is whether it was God or the devil
[1:34:58] and I ain't concerned about
[1:35:00] it cuz either way I never lost my cool
[1:35:03] or my doing we just kept working and got
[1:35:05] the water
[1:35:07] out I tried my best to fix the PIP
[1:35:10] back okay it's hard to say all things
[1:35:14] work together for good I told that to a
[1:35:16] lady one time at their funeral and her
[1:35:18] husband had died and she said well how
[1:35:20] can that be Sam when I got a husband
[1:35:21] dying and a son over here sick I said I
[1:35:24] don't know sis but that's what the Bible
[1:35:27] says said all things work
[1:35:31] together okay got to be something out of
[1:35:35] it it's hard to do but sometimes you
[1:35:37] know you just he said he sometimes he
[1:35:40] let Satan bring sickness to us why so
[1:35:44] that he can heal
[1:35:46] us right I thought we believed that he
[1:35:49] was a Healer then if he's a Healer then
[1:35:52] somebody got to be sick right amen right
[1:35:56] well and I'm not like brother Mo said
[1:35:57] about it one time and I agreed with him
[1:36:00] he said this man said I I got I'm sick
[1:36:02] for the glory of the
[1:36:04] Lord Brother M like me is always too
[1:36:06] blown I guess he said well I guess you
[1:36:09] saying if you got one arm off for the
[1:36:11] glory of the Lord just cut the other one
[1:36:12] off for the glory of the Lord well he
[1:36:14] certainly didn't want to volunteer
[1:36:17] arms it ain't to say we're sick for the
[1:36:20] glory of the Lord It's to say that
[1:36:22] sickness comes upon us because of the
[1:36:24] natural environment things happen
[1:36:26] because of the world we live in and the
[1:36:28] glory of the Lord is we're
[1:36:30] delivered not that we're
[1:36:32] sick people say well maybe by me having
[1:36:36] this that they can find a a a a cure for
[1:36:41] this by testing my
[1:36:43] body now where you read that in the
[1:36:48] Bible oh but we want to make all you we
[1:36:51] try to make everything okay unchangeable
[1:36:54] God 1962 when God makes a DEC makes a
[1:36:57] promise and and opposition
[1:37:01] rise that's only the test whether you
[1:37:04] really got the word or
[1:37:05] not okay the man that's got good go
[1:37:10] don't mind going to the testing Stone
[1:37:12] see that's true see it's only Peter said
[1:37:16] I believe it that these trials are come
[1:37:19] to test Us Try Us see what we'll do with
[1:37:23] it
[1:37:24] M to see what we'll do with it
[1:37:29] okay second seal which
[1:37:32] 1963

[1:37:37] unbelief take it away from us Lord we
[1:37:40] want to receive Rapture in Grace we want
[1:37:42] to be able when that mysterious thunder
[1:37:44] thunder out you under and the church is
[1:37:45] taken up we want to be ready to receive
[1:37:47] it Lord grant it try us Lord by Thy word

[1:38:41] word Shalom going on down which is a
[1:38:45] different no it's the same one but it's
[1:38:47] different paragraph paragraph 216

[1:38:52] Pains of his grace
[1:38:54] yeah suffering for his words that is
[1:38:56] growing pain of his grace yes sir just
[1:38:59] remember it's the grace of God has been
[1:39:02] given to
[1:39:05] you and see these were

[1:39:47] that in order to perfect us for his
[1:39:49] service he permits those things to
[1:39:51] happen can't you understand that

[1:39:56] the
[1:39:57] calling he's called you for that's your
[1:40:00] growing pains he did Daniel that way he
[1:40:02] did the Hebrew children that way fary
[1:40:04] furnace what the only only thing the FY
[1:40:06] furnace does he says there just got the
[1:40:08] bands off of the Hebrew children but see
[1:40:11] we're looking at it so bad all right
[1:40:14] Shalom this is this is another paragraph
[1:40:17] in this same
[1:40:18] message 1964 1119
[1:40:24] he talks about how that they they looked
[1:40:26] ahead they've done this they promised it
[1:40:28] you look and he says and then why does
[1:40:30] other things others make fun of me
[1:40:32] brother brandom you know others make fun
[1:40:34] of me and say I got long hair I got I'm
[1:40:37] oldfashioned to the women the men
[1:40:40] because I believe the Bible you don't
[1:40:42] have fellowship with us no more you
[1:40:44] can't accept we can't accept you because
[1:40:47] that that you believe such and such and
[1:40:49] you know exactly the way the word's
[1:40:51] written that's and you know it's exactly
[1:40:54] the way the word's written see you're
[1:40:55] staying with the truth now God Duty
[1:40:58] Bound to You to back up that Duty Bound
[1:41:01] to You to back up then that then excuse
[1:41:05] me God Duty Bound to You to back that up

[1:41:20] suffering for his word's sake is growing
[1:41:22] F pains for of his grace when you suffer
[1:41:25] for his word's sake It's Growing
[1:41:27] Pains Growing Pains look at Del light
[1:41:30] when total separation lber
[1:41:33] 64120 paragraph
[1:41:36] 24 I know they stand
[1:41:40] criticism but if we wasn't
[1:41:44] criticized then there'd be something
[1:41:46] wrong the world always knows its own but
[1:41:49] as I said that remember criticism on the
[1:41:52] account of the word of God is only
[1:41:54] Growing Pains of his grace is shows that
[1:41:56] you have separated yourself to to to be
[1:41:58] a Christian to act like one to live like
[1:42:01] one obey every commandment of God it's a
[1:42:03] Nazarite vow you called to be separated
[1:42:06] from the things of the
[1:42:07] world Listen Growing
[1:42:11] Pains of his
[1:42:14] grace that's what we've been doing for
[1:42:16] 407
[1:42:18] years well look like one of these days
[1:42:21] it' come to a place we get something
[1:42:25] you're not looking at what's happening
[1:42:26] number one so whenever things happens
[1:42:30] you remember the prophet I gave it to
[1:42:31] you the other
[1:42:33] day and see people can't see
[1:42:36] it amen I used to ask God and I know I'm
[1:42:40] serious and I know you don't understand
[1:42:43] me but there a certain brother used to
[1:42:45] come to this church and I used to ask
[1:42:46] him please don't do nothing while that
[1:42:47] man's
[1:42:49] here you say you I'll agree with you
[1:42:54] but you see that man was only built on
[1:42:56] signs and wonders and he'd run around
[1:42:58] the country SM spouting off about things
[1:43:00] happening and this church would fill up
[1:43:02] a bunch of
[1:43:03] unbelievers that all they wanted was
[1:43:05] signs and
[1:43:06] wonders I believe in it and you know
[1:43:08] better than to say anything about
[1:43:10] brother Dale don't believe in signs and
[1:43:15] wonders you know better than that cuz
[1:43:18] you know this man standing here can talk
[1:43:20] to you what what God has done and that
[1:43:23] I've seen an angel three times that I
[1:43:26] saw God when I was 10 or 11 years
[1:43:29] old that's not braging that's telling
[1:43:31] the truth so don't think that brother
[1:43:34] Dale doesn't believe in signs and
[1:43:35] wonders I believe in it more than
[1:43:37] anybody in this building or anybody in
[1:43:39] this world because I know what God
[1:43:42] is but I know if there's anybody healed
[1:43:44] anywhere he done it I know he's doing it
[1:43:48] out there to try me he's making it look
[1:43:51] like that we're nothing sitting here
[1:43:52] with sickness Among Us and all like that
[1:43:56] right people dying Among Us and other
[1:43:59] churches you're just rejoicing you even
[1:44:02] in a denomination just having great
[1:44:03] revivals and having great sweeping
[1:44:05] movings and having all kind of things
[1:44:08] yeah go there and look it
[1:44:11] over what have they
[1:44:14] got a bunch of shired short shorts on
[1:44:18] all kind of things running through the
[1:44:19] church but Glory Hallelujah they got the
[1:44:21] move of God M see that's to try
[1:44:25] you and even somebody come in the
[1:44:28] message to try to bring you to another
[1:44:30] Doctrine another
[1:44:32] God a river Jordan a two Soul or a seven
[1:44:35] Thunder virture or some kind of a
[1:44:36] Doctrine try to take you to them
[1:44:40] things it's the
[1:44:43] tri we've been in a child training
[1:44:45] period
[1:44:46] for ever since the prophet left to see
[1:44:49] if we would stay with the word God know
[1:44:52] the prophet that would stay with it but
[1:44:53] you know he casted him to
[1:44:56] see right you know that he knew Abraham
[1:44:59] would give his son but you know he had
[1:45:01] to let Abraham go up there and get
[1:45:06] ready
[1:45:08] right see that's my point sure I'm
[1:45:11] looking for something to
[1:45:13] happen I'm looking for when the head and
[1:45:16] body unit says a whole unit things are
[1:45:19] going to
[1:45:21] move but a whole unit won't be like
[1:45:23] everybody thinks it's not going to be
[1:45:26] everybody in this message because if
[1:45:28] we're not tutored and trained and
[1:45:30] positionally placed in the word to be
[1:45:33] waiting there is no headstone to come to
[1:45:36] that person which means we're going to
[1:45:38] go by the grave if we don't reach that
[1:45:40] place that's right and I said that how
[1:45:42] many years
[1:45:43] ago
[1:45:46] 30 that there would be plenty of people
[1:45:48] in this message that would die and go by
[1:45:50] the grave because they did not have
[1:45:52] nobody to teach them the message that
[1:45:55] the prophet had brought
[1:45:58] right you know that's been said 30 20 30
[1:46:02] years ago yes cuz I reminded you of it
[1:46:05] 20 30 times I guess or 100 times that's
[1:46:08] right not to be nasty or sarcastic but
[1:46:11] to tell the
[1:46:13] truth if I don't have it and I don't
[1:46:16] have the goods I'm going by the
[1:46:18] grave I'm talking about that I I'm a
[1:46:21] born again Christian and I'm even come
[1:46:23] to the faith of the fathers
[1:46:26] maybe see coming to the faith of the
[1:46:28] fathers is just a place to be
[1:46:31] waiting for the headstone to come
[1:46:33] brother Mo preached that years ago and I
[1:46:35] Rejoice he said there a place we got to
[1:46:38] be waiting what do you think I read that
[1:46:40] quote to start with that the hi and body
[1:46:42] have to unite in the last days to bring
[1:46:44] the
[1:46:45] message I've told you over and over I'm
[1:46:48] not arguing about brother brandham
[1:46:50] coming back whether he's coming back
[1:46:51] what he I believe he'll be back but I
[1:46:53] believe it'll be in the resurrection of
[1:46:54] all the saints amen and then he can
[1:46:57] preach to us for 30 40 days and that way
[1:47:00] I've told you what I even believe that
[1:47:02] he through a supernatural being could
[1:47:04] stand in every Church in this message
[1:47:07] and preach if he wanted to at the same
[1:47:12] time do you think brother Dale don't
[1:47:14] believe in
[1:47:17] Supernatural I believe that God is so
[1:47:19] Supernatural he could stand in every
[1:47:21] every Church in this world at one time
[1:47:23] that's right and be standing there as a
[1:47:25] person that's right right cuz he's
[1:47:30] God but you see he's trying
[1:47:34] us but why would we we be concerned
[1:47:38] Brother D you hurt my feelings cuz
[1:47:40] you're talking about
[1:47:45] me brother M used to make a good
[1:47:48] illustration and I've never been there
[1:47:50] and thank God for all these military
[1:47:52] people has been there but you remember
[1:47:54] when some of you older ones had to do
[1:47:55] the crawling underneath the Bob wire and
[1:47:58] the Machine Gun was shooting over the
[1:48:00] top of you with really live
[1:48:03] ammo right well you know nobody didn't
[1:48:06] get hurt unless they stood
[1:48:09] up well that's what brother M point was
[1:48:12] I can shoot a gun all the way across
[1:48:13] this congregation right the only person
[1:48:15] going to get hurt one standing up so if
[1:48:18] the shoe fits
[1:48:20] wor but listen I'm trying to get you and
[1:48:23] I to see God has been doing the greatest
[1:48:26] thing that he could ever want to do and
[1:48:28] that's child training his children to
[1:48:31] see if they'd stay with the word he has
[1:48:34] sent two Souls s tund virt polygamy all
[1:48:37] of these things among the people of the
[1:48:41] message the George Pikes the low's the
[1:48:44] the all believing they were gods and
[1:48:49] things he's let that come Among Us to
[1:48:53] see if we go after it that's
[1:48:56] right and giv them signs and
[1:48:59] wonders that looked like it was backing
[1:49:02] up their
[1:49:03] Ministry n it was proving God was
[1:49:07] real but he done that to try you and me
[1:49:10] yes to see what we'll do with word let's
[1:49:13] stand come on
[1:49:15] you to see if we'll stay with the
[1:49:19] word brother Dale you ain't nothing but
[1:49:21] word word word will you tell me
[1:49:22] something else supposed to be then I'll
[1:49:23] just be glad to change with
[1:49:25] you cuz I believe signs follow them that
[1:49:29] believe
[1:49:32] right we've seen God come here and do
[1:49:34] great
[1:49:36] things well I'm sick well okay believe
[1:49:41] it well I've asked God I've asked God
[1:49:44] I've asked God and he ain't delivered me
[1:49:46] ask him one more
[1:49:49] time but believe when you're asking
[1:49:53] that he hears
[1:49:54] you I used to go with brother M them
[1:49:57] when they go pray for the sick cuz I
[1:49:58] just a young Christian you know even at
[1:50:00] a Christian but coming out of the
[1:50:02] Baptist I used to go with him I remember
[1:50:04] we were up here at a Hooper family and
[1:50:07] uh brother Mo began to explain
[1:50:09] scriptures and I got them written in my
[1:50:10] Bible in perfect order like he'd
[1:50:11] explained and one of them was if God
[1:50:14] hears
[1:50:15] you and he'd say you know God is so
[1:50:18] great he can hear a gat as it flaps its
[1:50:20] wing
[1:50:23] that he can hear everything that ever
[1:50:24] does in the world said surely then he
[1:50:26] hears
[1:50:27] us cuz he said if we'd ask anything in
[1:50:30] his
[1:50:32] name and I saw a lady paralyzed set
[1:50:38] up oh yeah they had they had a son that
[1:50:41] was a Pentecostal preacher and he prayed
[1:50:43] for the sick but when it got serious
[1:50:46] they called brother mol and brother
[1:50:49] Tatum we got there that day and she took
[1:50:51] him she said told that boy she said take
[1:50:53] that Bible and lay it on my
[1:50:57] feet I said well let's ladies you
[1:51:01] know brother Mo when got we got through
[1:51:04] praying she just sat right up in the
[1:51:05] middle of the bed just just straight up
[1:51:06] sat there probably 20 minutes and I
[1:51:09] thought my Lord she's pretty heavily set
[1:51:12] okay you know pretty weit a lot and I
[1:51:15] thought my Lord I couldn't sit like that
[1:51:18] her feet just is straight out it
[1:51:19] wouldn't straight she sat there I
[1:51:22] thought well there one thing about it
[1:51:23] God had to touch that
[1:51:25] lady and brother Mo said to her now when
[1:51:27] you get the feeling better you you put a
[1:51:30] forth a little exercise on on your own
[1:51:32] you know said you get get up out of the
[1:51:34] bed you know kind of ease over the Ed
