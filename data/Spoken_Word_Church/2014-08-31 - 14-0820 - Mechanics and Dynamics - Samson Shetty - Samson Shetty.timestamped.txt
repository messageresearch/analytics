[57:12] when i can get to a place that is
[57:15] out of the way then god can come
[57:18] over and do things that william branham
[57:21] knows
[57:22] nothing about say i like that
[57:26] how brother branham he's not elevating
[57:28] someone said oh brother
[57:29] samson sherry you elevate brother
[57:31] branham to jesus christ see what he's
[57:33] talking about here
[57:34] what he said the greatest enemy is

[57:58] praise
[57:59] right amen and here what brother uh
[58:01] saint paul
[58:02] you know god is talking to saint paul he
[58:04] said and i'm reading this quotes from
[58:07] uh the message called perfect strength
[58:09] by perfect weakness 1961
[58:12] paragraph 40 42 2 and 181
[58:16] i'm not reading all the message book but
[58:17] few quotes here and here
[58:19] brother uh brother branham said god said
[58:22] to paul
[58:22] my strength is perfect in your weakness
[58:25] my strength becomes
[58:27] more perfect as you become more weaker
[58:30] the more
[58:31] you can yield to me the better i can use
[58:36] the more you can get forget about you
[58:39] education
[58:40] the more you can forget about your
[58:42] denomination the more you can forget
[58:44] about your stuff
[58:45] and yield yourself to me the more i can
[58:48] use
[58:48] cause you become weak a weak
[58:52] weaker vessel right many times people
[58:54] think that
[58:55] my wife is a weaker vessel and this
[58:57] woman is awakened vessel
[58:58] and you two brother sister you also me
[59:01] also
[59:02] this body is weak that's what the
[59:03] scripture says that's what the scripture
[59:06] says
[59:06] because man you know
[59:09] god didn't say man is weak but woman in
[59:12] peter
[59:13] right and as a bride of jesus christ we
[59:16] are woman
[59:17] spiritually speaking we are weak in this
[59:19] body
[59:20] but the spirit of god is making us
[59:23] strong praise god hallelujah
[59:27] amen and here brother branham is talking
[59:29] about you know jesus
[59:31] see who would think of the humility of
[59:34] his own son when he was born in a manger
[59:38] in a manual barn in a cow stall
[59:41] was wrapped in swaddling's cloth see
[59:45] he could have come through a palace he
[59:48] could have come
[59:48] down the couriers of heaven and full of
[59:52] anger salute angel salute but he choose
[59:55] to make christ the
[59:57] example for us and brought him in
[1:00:00] humility
[1:00:01] he never trained him in the schools of
[1:00:03] this world he trained him by his own
[1:00:06] power power because this body
[1:00:09] is weak this body is weak
[1:00:13] jesus became weak one time
[1:00:16] and he's crying unto the father god lord
[1:00:19] god
[1:00:20] if you will you can take this cuff from
[1:00:23] me
[1:00:23] that is the flesh speaking to the spirit
[1:00:26] god
[1:00:27] amen see his own power so could
[1:00:30] completely heal himself
[1:00:32] not to the thoughts of a man
[1:00:35] that's why jesus said whatever i heard
[1:00:37] from my father
[1:00:38] i speak unto you i'm not speaking by my
[1:00:41] own self
[1:00:42] this is not my own my my own thinking or
[1:00:45] my own
[1:00:46] minds my whatever you know it's it's
[1:00:48] something from god right
[1:00:50] amen hallelujah and or the strength of
[1:00:52] the world but ill himself to the power
[1:00:54] of god hallelujah
[1:00:56] the power of god is not denying the
[1:00:59] power of god
[1:01:00] why should we right no
[1:01:04] you know some people think in in my
[1:01:06] country brother samson we have
[1:01:07] a lot of message books and we have tapes
[1:01:09] and we can stay at home
[1:01:11] and we instead of going to church
[1:01:13] instead of going to church
[1:01:14] i said no sir you will have a power
[1:01:19] you will get the strength and power when
[1:01:22] you come together as a bride of jesus
[1:01:24] christ
[1:01:25] so that's why prophet of god said the
[1:01:27] spirit of god
[1:01:28] speaking through the prophet said
[1:01:30] nations uniting
[1:01:31] churches uniting and the bride is
[1:01:33] uniting uniting with what
[1:01:35] with the word with the word not by man's
[1:01:39] idea
[1:01:40] not but not by reasoning things it's
[1:01:42] uniting by the word of god
[1:01:44] by the revelation of jesus christ and
[1:01:46] hear what brother branham said
[1:01:48] god soldiers heroes they had to get weak
[1:01:51] before they could get strong god's
[1:01:54] soldiers god's heroes wow
[1:01:58] they had to get weak before they could
[1:02:00] get strong out of their weakness
[1:02:03] they were made strong hebrews
[1:02:06] chapter 11 34 here's something to
[1:02:09] console us
[1:02:10] here's something that encourages out of
[1:02:12] weakness and humility god chooses the
[1:02:14] people to build his kingdom
[1:02:16] out of amen if we ever get to heaven
[1:02:20] if we ever stand in the presence of god
[1:02:22] with his church
[1:02:24] will stand in a bunch of people that's
[1:02:27] been weak
[1:02:28] and rejected that's been weak
[1:02:32] and rejected oh nothing like this

[1:02:43] and he said he

[1:02:50] trying
[1:02:50] he's telling his disciple that he's
[1:02:52] going to build the church on that rock

[1:03:04] what they said you know jesus christ
[1:03:07] said this
[1:03:08] you know what a wonderful scripture but
[1:03:10] there is no more explanation
[1:03:11] they don't understand what that means
[1:03:13] until the prophet of god came onto the
[1:03:16] on the scene he said upon this rock
[1:03:19] means not as some some kind of substance
[1:03:22] not
[1:03:22] some kind of a place he's not trying to
[1:03:25] show them uh he's not showing them
[1:03:27] he's not pointing them any other stone
[1:03:28] or rock it is a divine revelation

[1:03:34] god
[1:03:35] upon this revelation upon this rock upon
[1:03:39] this unchangeable word of god

[1:04:22] hallelujah
[1:04:23] and i want to read this one quote you
[1:04:25] know here brother branham is talking
[1:04:26] about moses
[1:04:28] whenever you get licked and realized
[1:04:30] realized
[1:04:31] you're licked and then come back and
[1:04:34] humble yourself
[1:04:36] get weak find out your find out you are
[1:04:40] human and there none of your
[1:04:43] intellectual can do to human weakness
[1:04:47] will never be used of god
[1:04:51] excuses witnesses will not be used of
[1:04:54] god
[1:04:55] god by the human weakness pours
[1:04:58] people you are spurs himself
[1:05:02] into you then he uses himself
[1:05:05] you just become an instrument certainly
[1:05:08] you have got to get yourself out of the
[1:05:11] way
[1:05:11] moses learned moses learned
[1:05:15] human weakness is real good he learned
[1:05:17] it so well
[1:05:18] till when god called him he had six
[1:05:21] weaknesses
[1:05:23] he had six weaknesses that he could
[1:05:26] argue against
[1:05:27] god's call did you ever study in the
[1:05:30] first part of exodus
[1:05:32] the six weaknesses i got them wrote the
[1:05:35] route out here
[1:05:36] i want you to listen to them the first
[1:05:39] weakness he had
[1:05:40] was a lack of a message second weakness
[1:05:43] he had
[1:05:44] was a lack of authority the third
[1:05:46] weakness he had
[1:05:47] was lack of e-l-o-q-e-n-e-n-c-e
[1:05:52] how you pronounce that sir

[1:06:11] exception six weaknesses
[1:06:15] and god wants this man god wants this
[1:06:18] man
[1:06:19] hallelujah with six weaknesses he warns
[1:06:23] god wants him to use god wants him to go
[1:06:26] and deliver that people
[1:06:28] two million people when he came
[1:06:32] when he realized who you are who he was
[1:06:36] so you know god really you know god
[1:06:39] really used that man in a mighty way
[1:06:42] amen praise the lord hallelujah my
[1:06:44] precious brothers and sisters
[1:06:46] here it is almost 8 15 and you gave me a
[1:06:48] time
[1:06:49] at 7 15. if there is some more time i
[1:06:52] can read some quotes but
[1:06:53] you know if not so maybe god willing
[1:06:56] next time
[1:06:57] so anyhow my precious brothers and
[1:06:59] sisters
[1:07:00] this mechanics i haven't gone uh i
[1:07:03] haven't uh
[1:07:04] read uh you know the scriptures you know
[1:07:06] what uh uh
[1:07:07] you know the prophet of god uh the
[1:07:08] quotes here what he said but uh
[1:07:11] okay okay thank you i don't want to uh
[1:07:14] take your time i know
[1:07:15] you know your your children has to go to
[1:07:18] schools and you got to work
[1:07:19] but i won't i'm go i'm move fast the
[1:07:22] sign of the
[1:07:23] this time new york in 1963 he said we
[1:07:26] said last night we have so much
[1:07:28] of mechanics and not the dynamics now my
[1:07:30] body is the mechanics but my body
[1:07:32] will not operate without
[1:07:36] the dynamics the spirit see and the
[1:07:38] spirit operates my body
[1:07:40] right amen brings it in control
[1:07:44] like an automobile i like this how
[1:07:47] brother branham
[1:07:48] talking about this mechanics and
[1:07:49] dynamics and he took our cars and
[1:07:52] convention you know combustion
[1:07:54] combustion yeah
[1:07:55] like an automobile with no gasoline in
[1:07:57] it
[1:07:58] with no firing power see no matter how
[1:08:02] fine the dynamics
[1:08:03] or i mean excuse me i got my accent
[1:08:10] of course you you you uh hear different
[1:08:13] kinds of accents
[1:08:16] my i got my accent but one day we don't
[1:08:18] have any accent we will speak in one
[1:08:19] language
[1:08:20] hey man the mechanics is fixed up
[1:08:23] the cylinders and the points the plugs
[1:08:26] and whatever more
[1:08:27] it's got to have the current also you've
[1:08:30] got to take
[1:08:31] those together that's the way god is
[1:08:34] it's got to get a believer with god to
[1:08:37] make
[1:08:38] the contact then something is going to
[1:08:40] happen
[1:08:41] amen amen that made the same
[1:08:44] dynamic power fall upon the church
[1:08:47] right in the early church and so that's
[1:08:50] why
[1:08:51] saint thomas came to india amen in 1890s
[1:08:55] and all the bunch of all you know uh you
[1:08:58] know brahmins and hindu priests they
[1:09:00] went
[1:09:00] and they're worshiping sun god and you
[1:09:02] know offering the water to the
[1:09:04] sun god and this man disciple thomas
[1:09:07] came to india and he had seen this those
[1:09:10] hindu people what they are doing
[1:09:12] and they said what are you doing they
[1:09:14] said we are praying to our god
[1:09:16] and offering this water so why don't
[1:09:18] your god is
[1:09:20] receiving that water or your offering
[1:09:24] then they don't have answer and he told
[1:09:26] them
[1:09:27] if i give if i offer water to my god
[1:09:31] it won't fall down and he went into that
[1:09:34] ocean you know he
[1:09:35] he just prayed lord accept in jesus name
[1:09:40] nothing one drop never fall down
[1:09:44] hallelujah praise god that is the power
[1:09:48] that is the power when brother gary
[1:09:50] walker visited us in year
[1:09:52] 2012 in the midday of the meeting
[1:09:56] all you know our we had over
[1:09:59] uh 4 000 people attended in the meetings
[1:10:02] in four days meetings four thousand
[1:10:05] people attended
[1:10:06] and everywhere you see the people the
[1:10:08] roads was blocked
[1:10:09] and you know everywhere you see the
[1:10:11] people but you know what happened one
[1:10:13] one in the midday in the in the day time
[1:10:16] was very humidity and hot and all of a
[1:10:20] sudden while brother
[1:10:21] brother gary walker preaching i was
[1:10:23] interpreting for him
[1:10:24] all of a sudden right side from the
[1:10:26] right side we felt a cool
[1:10:28] breeze a cool air coming through
[1:10:31] all of a sudden the atmosphere was
[1:10:33] changed the weather changed
[1:10:35] and you know on top of our tent
[1:10:38] a cloud was appeared
[1:10:41] cloud appeared except our meeting place
[1:10:45] was covered by the cloud
[1:10:48] and uh ministering brethren all the
[1:10:50] sitting the brothers are pointing me
[1:10:52] on top and i don't understand what they
[1:10:54] are talking about but all of a sudden i
[1:10:55] felt
[1:10:56] some cool priests coming from the right
[1:10:58] side
[1:10:59] and i oh this is very nice we can go
[1:11:02] from here to ours
[1:11:04] hallelujah praise god so the
[1:11:08] brother gary is preaching and i'm
[1:11:10] interpreting feel good
[1:11:12] you know that is nothing but what i what
[1:11:14] i believe
[1:11:17] the holy ghost the whirlwind
[1:11:20] the wind hallelujah glory
[1:11:24] amen among his people
[1:11:27] right amen he is shaking the world up
[1:11:30] and down
[1:11:32] and ah that cloud was appeared and it is
[1:11:35] amazing
[1:11:36] a great testimony and every day 200
[1:11:39] people coming in the prayer line
[1:11:40] and we are laying hands all the minister
[1:11:42] brothers on the platform
[1:11:43] laying hands on the people and the
[1:11:45] people going through the prayer line
[1:11:47] and a boy named by murali 11 years boy
[1:11:51] he spoke he's a deaf boy not able to
[1:11:54] speak
[1:11:55] from his childhood from his birth 11
[1:11:58] years boy
[1:11:59] next day morning he started speaking he
[1:12:02] said hallelujah
[1:12:03] amen i said what's your name
[1:12:07] thank you saints what's your name he
[1:12:09] said morally
[1:12:10] and i called upon the stage i have the
[1:12:12] videos
[1:12:13] and i asked him to speak i said
[1:12:15] hallelujah
[1:12:16] and he said hallelujah praise the lord
[1:12:18] my name is sunso
[1:12:20] that is the first time he's speaking in
[1:12:21] the meetings see
[1:12:23] that is the holy ghost the gospel came
[1:12:26] not by the word only
[1:12:27] by the power and the demonstration of
[1:12:29] the holy ghost
[1:12:30] amen um silver and gold is not with us
[1:12:34] we have what we have we give you that
[1:12:37] that is the name of the lord jesus
[1:12:39] christ
[1:12:40] brother gary walker asked me what can i
[1:12:42] what what what can we
[1:12:44] bring to you from australia brother
[1:12:46] samson what would you like to
[1:12:47] bring us to to you india uh bill samson
[1:12:50] i said
[1:12:51] brother gary we would like to see the
[1:12:53] power and the demonstration of the holy
[1:12:55] ghost
[1:12:56] in the meetings bring the word with the
[1:12:59] power and the demonstration
[1:13:00] that's all we want that's all we need
[1:13:03] because that
[1:13:04] that that the dynamic power going to
[1:13:06] change these 16 elements body
[1:13:08] and it's going to change in a twinkle of
[1:13:11] glory hallelujah
[1:13:12] praise the name of the lord glory to god
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:16] my precious brothers and sisters uh here
[1:13:19] brother brahm said it won't move no
[1:13:21] matter how good the mechanics is
[1:13:22] until the dynamics comes when the
[1:13:24] dynamics comes the fire is made to
[1:13:26] connect
[1:13:27] with the octane in the gasoline
[1:13:30] and when the explores it causes a
[1:13:33] combustion
[1:13:34] combustion moves every motion every move
[1:13:37] for e is the same yesterday today
[1:13:40] and forever that's the resurrection
[1:13:44] that's the resurrection that's the real
[1:13:46] power of god
[1:13:47] mechanics with dynamics message books
[1:13:50] with the power of god
[1:13:52] message with the word with the power
[1:13:56] with the holy ghost born again
[1:13:58] experience
[1:13:59] dynamic power glory
[1:14:02] notice it's the spirit that quickens it
[1:14:05] is the spark
[1:14:06] that fires not the gas that fires
[1:14:09] it is the it is the fire it is the spark
[1:14:14] ah brother adam said how much you got i
[1:14:17] don't care
[1:14:18] you've got to be have that fire amen
[1:14:20] hallelujah
[1:14:21] it is not the gas that fires it's the
[1:14:24] spark that fires the gas
[1:14:26] see praise the name of the lord
[1:14:27] hallelujah amen
[1:14:29] until the church becomes both dynamics
[1:14:31] and mechanics
[1:14:32] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:14:36] do the things that he did
[1:14:38] if he hit on 16 slenders so will the
[1:14:41] bride amen
[1:14:43] hallelujah but he said john 14 12 he
[1:14:47] that believeth on me
[1:14:48] the works that i do he shall do also
[1:14:51] i will give him a change of my dynamics
[1:14:53] and in his mechanics
[1:14:55] that's world will not be able to
[1:14:57] withstand it
[1:14:59] and i will rise him up up again in the
[1:15:01] last day
[1:15:02] that's the easter's message right yeah
[1:15:05] he is speaking in the message called it
[1:15:07] is the rising of sun 1965 you all know
[1:15:09] that
[1:15:10] amen together that's the eastern message
[1:15:13] the dynamics and the mechanics together
[1:15:15] right the dynamics without the mechanics
[1:15:19] without the dynamics
[1:15:20] no good right that's right no good
[1:15:23] neither the dynamics without the
[1:15:25] mechanics
[1:15:26] you can scream and shout and jump and up
[1:15:28] and down all you want to
[1:15:30] deny this word it won't do any good you
[1:15:33] are just
[1:15:33] cranking around the pistons of
[1:15:37] got that spark on the fire but no
[1:15:41] gasoline to fire it by
[1:15:42] right hallelujah when i'm preaching
[1:15:46] you know in my church all of a sudden
[1:15:49] the snake came into the into the
[1:15:52] you know building
[1:15:56] you don't see that here recently we had
[1:15:59] a minister's meeting
[1:16:00] and uh one of our minister brother
[1:16:02] killed that snake
[1:16:03] i told the brothers to you know you sit
[1:16:05] here and fellowship and i i just walked
[1:16:07] through
[1:16:08] the door and the snake was in the corner
[1:16:12] was there in the corner and i didn't
[1:16:14] notice that
[1:16:15] and i walked very fast and
[1:16:18] after i went outside the brothers in the
[1:16:20] platform they
[1:16:21] shouted and brother there is a there is
[1:16:23] something snake over there
[1:16:25] and i thought uh i'm outside so one of
[1:16:29] the brothers took
[1:16:30] the rod and he killed that snake
[1:16:34] but that won't bother us
[1:16:37] how people sit for two hours sometimes
[1:16:40] three hours
[1:16:41] and they scream and shout and you know
[1:16:44] they they yield and they
[1:16:45] they they they pull on the gift praise
[1:16:48] the lord hallelujah
[1:16:49] right of course they they have to work
[1:16:52] too you know
[1:16:53] they go to work like a daily wage of
[1:16:55] slavers from morning nine o'clock to
[1:16:57] evening five o'clock they work hard
[1:16:59] and they get only you know maybe 200 300
[1:17:02] 500 rupees
[1:17:03] per day you know that is like a five
[1:17:05] dollar something like that you know
[1:17:07] so anyway my precious brothers and
[1:17:09] sisters you know the mechanics
[1:17:11] and dynamics we have a mechanics in our
[1:17:15] life
[1:17:16] but we got to have we need more
[1:17:19] of dynamic power which is the
[1:17:22] supernatural power of god
[1:17:24] which is the holy ghost amen that is
[1:17:27] running the church that is running you
[1:17:29] that is moving you that is moving me
[1:17:32] that brought me here and i traveled 24
[1:17:35] hours in the plane
[1:17:36] and 10 000 miles other side of the globe
[1:17:39] it is almost 12 hours difference
[1:17:41] so that's why jesus said one is on the
[1:17:43] field one is on the bed
[1:17:46] see and romans like we read the
[1:17:49] scriptures romans 8 11
[1:17:50] it's brother adam is talking it is if
[1:17:53] the spirit that raised up jesus from the
[1:17:55] dead
[1:17:56] be in you it will also quicken your
[1:17:58] mortal bodies
[1:18:00] if the spirit that raised upon jesus
[1:18:02] from the dead
[1:18:03] if it be in you it is also quicken your
[1:18:06] moral bodies
[1:18:07] quicken it what does the word quicken
[1:18:09] mean
[1:18:10] the greek word means to be brought to
[1:18:13] life after death hallelujah
[1:18:17] there is the gate of worship worshiping
[1:18:19] in the spirit and in the truth
[1:18:21] mechanics and dynamics together a spirit
[1:18:25] and the word logos and rhema
[1:18:29] word and the power and spirit
[1:18:32] amen you see what i mean if the spirit
[1:18:35] that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:18:36] dwells in you
[1:18:38] it will quicken make alive your mortal
[1:18:41] bodies
[1:18:42] because it's already alive and when it
[1:18:44] comes into your
[1:18:45] body it brings your whole body
[1:18:49] subject to it right wow all right
[1:18:52] praise god thank you lord subject to
[1:18:55] what
[1:18:56] the word of god
[1:19:00] we may read we must study we may hear
[1:19:04] we may do all these things but subject
[1:19:07] to word
[1:19:09] anchor to word right that never
[1:19:12] shaked me that never shaked my faith
[1:19:16] when my my uncle offered me to come
[1:19:19] into that religion or into their
[1:19:21] denomination
[1:19:23] never one of my cousin also asked me to
[1:19:26] come
[1:19:26] and to join with him he's also a good
[1:19:29] man
[1:19:30] and he's a pentecostal man and he said
[1:19:32] we have a nice bible college
[1:19:34] we will offer you don't worry about
[1:19:36] feast don't worry about anything
[1:19:40] lots of choices lots of opportunities
[1:19:44] we are not moses we are not elijah we
[1:19:47] are not peter we're not not we are not
[1:19:49] paul
[1:19:50] but we are saving serving the same god
[1:19:53] we are serving the same god i love that
[1:19:55] hallelujah
[1:19:56] amen it brings your whole body to
[1:19:59] subject
[1:20:00] subject toward the word of god if it is
[1:20:03] in you
[1:20:04] if it is in you the holy ghost makes us
[1:20:08] and molds us and brings us to anchor
[1:20:12] to that word anchor to christ
[1:20:15] christ is the anointed word of this hour
[1:20:20] hallelujah i'm great dynamic power
[1:20:24] hallelujah
[1:20:25] and here brother branham uh do i have
[1:20:28] time
[1:20:30] yeah so here uh brother brandon looking
[1:20:32] onto jesus 1964 he said the mechanics
[1:20:35] don't run the church
[1:20:36] it's the dynamics the holy ghost that
[1:20:38] gets into the word
[1:20:40] and it's not seminary that teaches you
[1:20:42] all the theology and the greek
[1:20:43] interpretations but it's the dynamics of
[1:20:46] the holy ghost
[1:20:47] right in there to set that a fire
[1:20:50] and to bring it to pass and to make it
[1:20:53] live just exactly
[1:20:54] what the promised world is for this
[1:20:58] however
[1:21:00] i like that nothing like this message to
[1:21:03] whom shall we go lord
[1:21:05] amen without this message if we leave
[1:21:07] this pleasure to whom shall we go
[1:21:10] glory i don't care about anyone
[1:21:14] i i already anchored i'm i'm in love
[1:21:17] affair with my lord
[1:21:18] and i was engaged i mean got exposed to
[1:21:22] my lord right in first church age i was
[1:21:24] with him
[1:21:25] right amen hallelujah and i was married
[1:21:27] to him
[1:21:28] right like paul said one husband not
[1:21:30] three
[1:21:31] one husband one husband not three
[1:21:34] hallelujah
[1:21:35] and here the word and the spirit
[1:21:38] hallelujah now the mechanics the
[1:21:40] dynamics it takes mechanics and dynamics
[1:21:42] the world and the spirit they are one
[1:21:46] that gives life not only this mortal
[1:21:49] body
[1:21:50] but it has to be you we got to have that
[1:21:54] power of the holy ghost or the spirit
[1:21:57] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21:59] a born-again experience a personal
[1:22:02] relationship with god
[1:22:04] not depending upon someone's idea
[1:22:07] if my father if my if my if my dad
[1:22:10] preaching this message automatically you
[1:22:12] know when i was
[1:22:13] you know if i grow up with him i always
