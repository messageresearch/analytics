[5:02] just help us Lord tonight as we come to
[5:04] this place that we lord we've we've
[5:07] dealt on for quite a while and talking
[5:10] about the things of Grace and your love
[5:13] unto each and every one of us and
[5:15] showing us the the things that the
[5:17] prophet has brought unto us and we pray
[5:20] that you would just help us tonight as
[5:21] we try to meditate upon these things and
[5:23] speak about them and you bring back to
[5:25] our remembrance Lord because we we want
[5:28] to speak what you would have to be said
[5:31] and forgive our sins lead us by thine
[5:33] understanding remember those that are
[5:34] sick among us Lord and just bless each
[5:37] and everyone Lord we love you and we
[5:39] thank you in Jesus name amen amen
[5:43] Matthew
[5:49] 19 verse three the Pharisees came unto
[5:51] him tempting him and saying unto him is
[5:54] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[5:56] forever cause now we covered that not
[5:58] forever cause right only for adultery
[6:02] fornication right right and he answered
[6:05] and said unto them have you not
[6:07] read that he which made them at the
[6:10] beginning made them male and female now
[6:11] we've covered for not any cause for put
[6:13] her away and remarry right uh you know
[6:16] we covered the different things in there
[6:19] I need to put it that way is because
[6:21] we're talking about you know putting
[6:23] away and Remar all right and said for
[6:25] this cause shall a man leave his father
[6:27] and mother and shall cleave to his wife
[6:30] and they twain shall be one flesh
[6:32] wherefore there are no more Twain but
[6:33] one flesh what therefore God hath joined
[6:36] together let not man put us under
[6:38] brother R said man better not try to put
[6:40] us under what God put together all right
[6:42] they say unto him why did Moses then
[6:45] command to give a writing of divorcement
[6:47] and to put her away he said unto them
[6:49] Moses because of the hardness of your
[6:50] hearts suffered you to put away your
[6:52] wives but from the beginning it was not
[6:55] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[6:57] put away his wife except it be for
[7:00] fornication and shall marit another
[7:02] commited adultery whosoever marit her
[7:04] which is put away do commit adul all
[7:07] right now we go to Romans
[7:18] 7 know you not brethren for I speak to
[7:20] them that know the law how that the law
[7:22] have dominion over a man as long as he
[7:24] liveth for the woman which hath a
[7:25] husband is bound by the law to her
[7:27] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[7:30] husband be dead she is loose from the
[7:32] law of her husband so then if while her
[7:35] husband liveth she be married to another
[7:36] man she shall be called an adulteress
[7:39] but if her husband be dead she is free
[7:41] from that law so that she is no
[7:43] adulteress though she be married to
[7:44] another man wherefore my brethren ye
[7:47] also are become dead to the law by the
[7:50] body of Christ that you should be
[7:52] married to another even to him who is
[7:54] raised from the dead that we should walk
[7:57] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[7:59] God amen all right so let's just stop
[8:01] there because we'll we've been through
[8:04] verse six and now going on you may be
[8:06] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[8:08] reading of the word
[8:13] now I I covered something Sunday okay
[8:17] now this will be a lot of this will be
[8:19] reviewing back over
[8:20] that okay and you know because that I
[8:25] wanted something in your mind to think
[8:28] on and if anyone hears this I would
[8:31] invite you to please go back and listen
[8:33] to last Sunday afternoon's message
[8:36] because we're trying to get down to the
[8:39] grace of God Amen now I want to ask you
[8:42] a question just right on the start I
[8:44] love
[8:45] questions and I like to ask
[8:51] them what
[8:54] happened the day the grace of marriage
[8:56] and divorce was
[8:58] given
[9:02] the Prophet come together and gave a
[9:05] Grace now I want to ask you a simple
[9:08] question brother R said they came there
[9:11] with two or three wives two or three
[9:13] husbands right right is that true right
[9:20] amen but when they left did they leave
[9:23] with two or three or did you leave with
[9:26] one now which way was it
[9:29] and we've covered that now as to showing
[9:33] the
[9:34] grace of marriage and divorce through
[9:37] Moses through Paul through brother
[9:40] randam right that you didn't have to be
[9:42] standing there that day sitting there in
[9:44] the building
[9:46] right but it be when you hear it that's
[9:50] right and can accept it for yourself
[9:53] right right
[9:55] amen and then we covered that it was
[9:57] only far the Believers of the message
[10:00] that's it not for everybody amen it's
[10:03] for everybody that can believe the
[10:05] message amen
[10:06] right now the message is the
[10:09] Bible okay now I want to ask you a
[10:13] simple
[10:16] question say that I went there with you
[10:20] know been married three
[10:22] times
[10:24] and when I
[10:26] left if I can accept the grace of
[10:29] marriage and divorce I didn't leave with
[10:30] three wives did I that's right right
[10:33] we've covered that that we wouldn't go
[10:35] back and live with the other
[10:38] two you know we're not in the days of
[10:42] polygamy but they sure a lot of egies
[10:45] out there think
[10:47] so but I want to ask you just
[10:51] simple see I went there with three
[10:54] wives and if I can truly believe the
[10:57] grace of marriage and divorce I'd leave
[10:58] with one one wasn't that's
[11:01] right that's right and you believe that
[11:05] amen now some of you looking at me like
[11:08] you're not going to answer that do you
[11:10] believe that you'd leave with one wife
[11:12] how about a raise a hand
[11:15] amen okay so everybody in the building
[11:17] says we leave with one wife right all
[11:21] right now what happened to the other two
[11:26] right
[11:27] right
[11:31] what took
[11:35] place what took place that day that the
[11:38] prophet said and we gave it over and
[11:41] over that on marriage and divorce he
[11:43] said a a supernatural
[11:46] Revelation because of the opening of The
[11:50] Seven all right and I've preach to you
[11:53] what I believe on that that if we don't
[11:56] have a revelation of the understanding
[11:59] for our individual things not that
[12:02] everybody's going to understand the same
[12:04] and all like that we we never tried to
[12:06] do that right but what we must each one
[12:10] understand to bring us to a position to
[12:12] where that we could receive a
[12:14] supernatural Revelation amen and then we
[12:17] covered that even that brother Brown
[12:18] said Abel had a supernatural Revelation
[12:22] this is just in case some of you missed
[12:23] it so I believe all Revelation is
[12:26] Supernatural amen there's no such thing
[12:28] is a natural Revelation natural
[12:31] Revelation is letters on the page
[12:33] Supernatural Revelation is a revealed
[12:35] word of God all right because of the
[12:37] revealed word of God you could go home
[12:39] with one wife or one husband if you were
[12:42] the the woman you know and having two or
[12:45] three husbands and leaving and going
[12:47] home with one husband all but what
[12:50] happened to the others that was left
[12:54] there what would be your answer to
[12:57] that
[13:01] now we're not talking about going there
[13:04] having four or five wives polygamy right
[13:07] right
[13:08] polygamy uh you know I just plunt okay
[13:13] somebody going there that had two or
[13:14] three wives that were not you know
[13:17] married and divorced and married and
[13:18] divorced and I'm not even talking about
[13:21] that garbage can ain't talking about
[13:23] somebody that would go there and
[13:26] claiming to believe the message but have
[13:29] three or four living common law wives or
[13:32] whatever you want to call it right
[13:34] they're BL enough don't believe in that
[13:38] amen that wouldn't work right so we're
[13:41] only talking about someone who went
[13:44] there that had been married and divorced
[13:46] and married and divorced you know
[13:48] something like that and have two and
[13:49] maybe married a third one or some woman
[13:52] that had married two or three different
[13:53] men but was married and divorced from
[13:55] each one of those and she winds up you
[13:57] know being married to number three guy
[13:59] or
[14:00] something if the truly Revelation could
[14:03] be there they could go home with one but
[14:06] that's what I'm telling you now don't
[14:07] get no polygamy tied up into this this
[14:09] thing cuz that's garbage king that's
[14:11] right don't say that they would be some
[14:13] guy walk up there with three or four
[14:15] living wives you know
[14:16] some
[14:18] situation you know Common laws that
[14:21] wouldn't work cuz that wouldn't even fit
[14:23] nowhere in the Bible right all
[14:26] right now blunt plain but that's where
[14:30] that nobody can argue the point when I
[14:33] get through saying what I will at the
[14:35] end of the message the Lord
[14:36] willing but
[14:39] now so we started covering Sunday a
[14:42] thing that that I told you that I have
[14:44] been dealing with for 40 years about it
[14:47] of a way of trying to
[14:49] express what I could
[14:53] see and I've tried before to express it
[14:57] and preach some of the things that you
[14:59] here and tried to express it and I
[15:01] believe it I still believe what I
[15:03] preached there was right you know and uh
[15:07] but there's something that we need to
[15:11] understand all right so now Sunday
[15:14] afternoon we started on a uh the message
[15:18] talking about
[15:21] that we would cover from the invisible
[15:27] Union and we would would cover three
[15:31] things you remember that three things
[15:34] would be
[15:35] covered we would cover the new
[15:39] birth and to see how that we could be
[15:42] free
[15:44] enough
[15:46] to accept Jesus Christ and him accept us
[15:50] amen all
[15:51] right now then we said we would cover it
[15:55] from the basis of our old husb husband
[15:59] there that brother Brandon will use the
[16:01] old husband as your old adamic nature
[16:04] mhm in the new birth and we'll get to
[16:06] that in a minute but then he picks it up
[16:08] into a higher form of saying about your
[16:11] old husband your old denominationalism
[16:15] amen and you can say well the day I got
[16:17] born again I was set free from all
[16:20] denominationalism well I just call you
[16:22] BL a liar up front and we'll talk about
[16:24] it amen no
[16:26] argument that's plain
[16:29] see what's our trouble is the prophet
[16:31] said that Jesus Christ set us free but
[16:33] we're Bound by our Creeds and ideas and
[16:36] our denominational thoughts that's right
[16:38] oh I don't have any I never was in a
[16:40] denomination you born one the natural
[16:43] carnal mind is organizational ISM right
[16:47] amen all right so then we would cover
[16:50] the new
[16:51] birth and to see how that that old
[16:54] person can die and then we cover the
[17:01] the grace of marriage and divorce
[17:02] extended unto us as we'll read the
[17:04] minute where the Prophet said invisible
[17:06] Union that this is a greater portion of
[17:08] marriage and
[17:11] divorce all right y now so that would be
[17:15] how our old denominational husband can
[17:18] be dead right
[17:24] amen but then we would we'll get down to
[17:27] the grace of marriage and
[17:30] divorce to see the things that is
[17:33] covered to
[17:35] understand who's free and who's
[17:39] not now remember the question I asked
[17:44] you say I went there with three
[17:49] wives when I left we believed that I
[17:53] left one if I really believe it that's
[17:55] right right I'm not to try to go back as
[17:57] we'll read in a little while and pick
[17:59] them up and hang them up in a closet you
[18:01] know to be lived with somewhere down the
[18:03] road or anything
[18:06] no but you know what in that situation
[18:09] is a very odd situation because say that
[18:12] I was married three
[18:15] times and all three of them were still
[18:19] alive you know as far as the world is
[18:21] concerned and far as life and looking
[18:24] that's right those two women would still
[18:26] be living that's right right
[18:29] and going on and maybe remarrying and
[18:32] all kind of things
[18:34] right now number
[18:37] two just because you're a denominational
[18:41] husband that you can see him as he's
[18:43] dead remember it's not going to end it
[18:46] it just goes right
[18:48] on right
[18:51] amen I I mean I come out of the Baptist
[18:53] Church the day did I come out did the
[18:54] Baptist Church Anni late and go away you
[18:56] know come on you come out of the message
[18:58] this brother did that uh you know did
[19:00] that make you just did it just destroy
[19:03] the whole no it didn't destroy nothing
[19:05] did it right how about Brother Gary
[19:08] where did you come out of he just
[19:11] shaking his head about
[19:13] everything you understand what I
[19:15] mean those things are still alive and
[19:19] still going that's
[19:22] right yep and your name may still be on
[19:25] the records of those churches sure
[19:31] you right because they had record books
[19:34] unless you asked for it they wouldn't
[19:35] take it
[19:37] off so what could happen to make that
[19:41] turn out to be the right
[19:43] thing all right now let's approach
[19:46] it as what I said we were going to try
[19:48] to
[19:50] do we will see then that the new
[19:54] birth and the way it comes and what
[19:57] happens
[19:59] will be setting the
[20:00] stage to understand your old husband
[20:03] amen and the ability for him to die your
[20:06] old denominationalism
[20:10] yep then you'll see really what as we'll
[20:12] read in a minute brother BR said you see
[20:14] what happened there at marriage and
[20:22] divorce so I kind of lay that down
[20:24] Sunday to kind of get it in a thought of
[20:27] a a way
[20:29] and I know I'm going to work Brother
[20:30] Anderson and them to death because they
[20:32] had the notes from Sunday and we still
[20:35] got the same quote things but we're
[20:37] going to be jumping so if they get
[20:39] behind a little bit I'll wait on them I
[20:41] done told them I just made up my mind
[20:44] it's change you know to change the route
[20:45] I was going a little bit to understand
[20:49] all right now you know me and what I've
[20:52] always say
[20:54] it how is it that I check a
[20:57] Doctrine
[20:58] that's right by my new birth that's
[21:04] right you say well I check it by the
[21:07] word well if you've got the new birth
[21:10] that is the birth of the word that's not
[21:13] you
[21:14] know but if you don't have the new birth
[21:17] and got the word you can't check
[21:21] anything so I check doctrines and Things
[21:24] by my new
[21:26] birth to see if the those things fit in
[21:29] any realm right if they don't then I say
[21:32] well there's something wrong with my new
[21:34] birth or there's something wrong with
[21:35] their
[21:37] Doctrine then is when we get into the
[21:40] digging into the word to see how it
[21:45] fits so now let's take it so we're going
[21:47] to start reading just a little and we
[21:49] gave these as I said we gave them Sunday
[21:52] and and we're going to be going back
[21:53] over them so you know forgive
[21:56] me and uh
[21:59] pray for me let's go with number one
[22:00] brother Anderson I re yeah he's back
[22:03] there sometimes they swap out on so you
[22:06] know and these these guys do wonderful
[22:09] uh Dale Richard and and Aaron's Daddy
[22:13] was telling how wonderful he said now I
[22:16] get to meet the man that a name goes
[22:18] with he said he'd always say Brother
[22:20] Anderson he said I didn't know who
[22:22] Brother Anderson was I said well it's
[22:24] hard hard be hard for me to pronounce
[22:27] Maron go they say I'm doing pretty good
[22:29] at it we keeping with Brother Anderson
[22:32] all right now look what the prophet is
[22:34] saying Paul here is given an
[22:36] illustration I'm going to read fast on
[22:38] some of these to get through so you can
[22:40] read it up there okay Paul here is given
[22:42] an illustration in our scripture about
[22:44] the law and Grace and illustrating it
[22:46] like marriage and divorce this passage
[22:47] is very seldom preached on because it
[22:50] more or less pertains to like marriage
[22:52] and divorce right Romans 7 is what he's
[22:54] talking about right it pertains to
[22:56] marriage and divorce but it also
[22:58] pertains to a greater portion of
[23:01] marriage and divorce of how that he's
[23:04] trying to set in order here that we as a
[23:06] church can be no more married to the
[23:09] world and to Christ new birth right
[23:12] number one at the same time and be
[23:14] legally and lawfully about it and for a
[23:16] woman living with a husband all right
[23:18] then he said I believe it unfolds one of
[23:20] the greatest mysteries of Prophecy
[23:22] setting an order of scriptures all right
[23:26] now then let's start off with the new
[23:29] birth and let's cover the new birth as
[23:32] the prophet covers it from the invisible
[23:34] Union cuz that was what I asked you to
[23:36] to read and uh so let's see what we've
[23:40] got all right number
[23:42] four that's what I said it's going to
[23:44] take jumping and we're going to be
[23:46] moving so forgive me and you're going to
[23:50] see right up
[23:52] here what I'll be talking
[23:55] about when it comes down that we're
[23:57] we're talking about denominationalism
[23:59] it'll be written there when it comes
[24:01] down to we're talking about marriage and
[24:03] divorce or I believe the prophet is
[24:04] covering it that's what we're going to
[24:06] be covering and it'll be written up
[24:07] there all right amen now so hold on to
[24:10] what we're talking
[24:12] about
[24:14] okay that's all together out of the
[24:17] reaches for her she don't want that oh
[24:20] no sir no indeed what does she do then
[24:23] so she brings forth a power of painted
[24:25] face short bearing Jezebel soci
[24:28] illegitimate cats they call him and I
[24:29] think it's calling come on down I'm
[24:31] going to jump some so just read it in
[24:34] between she was born or
[24:36] married connected with her first
[24:39] husband first husband now who is this
[24:43] first husband he's talking about the
[24:44] first Adam right so that's your natural
[24:48] life so don't deal in organizational ISM
[24:51] and marriage and divorce of how many
[24:53] wives deal with what we're talking about
[24:55] the New Birth she was born Mary
[24:58] connected with her first husband the
[24:59] first Adam by the adulterous wife of Eve
[25:03] Adam's first wife you say adulterous she
[25:05] sure was but oh she claims that this
[25:07] Adam this first Adam is
[25:10] dead now
[25:12] watch oh sure he died a long time ago
[25:16] I'm reborn again she said and I'm
[25:19] certainly married to the second Adam
[25:22] Christ the
[25:23] word see now that's what the basis of
[25:26] organized religion the basis of religion
[25:28] not only organized we call basis of
[25:31] religion is what right the new birth
[25:33] you're born again your old adamic nature
[25:37] for the soul right
[25:40] amen not for your body and spirit now
[25:43] cuz you're not born again your body and
[25:44] your spirit that's right the olamic
[25:46] nature of your soul Y is to
[25:50] die and you are to be
[25:54] reborn now to become a Christian now
[25:58] notice what she loves watch her lover
[26:01] her you want to see who she's in love
[26:02] with and look what he say the word says
[26:06] this but she said my church says this
[26:08] now let time together with denomination
[26:10] L but we're holding a point then who is
[26:12] she L who is she in love with who is her
[26:16] husband her own fruits prove what she is
[26:18] exactly right shows what she is notice
[26:21] she was born first to Adam cuz that's
[26:24] her natural birth see and she never left
[26:27] that
[26:29] and you just people just don't leave it
[26:32] they just move over into another place
[26:34] or brother Mo said get your coat and hat
[26:35] and go to another beeting place all
[26:38] right they don't leave it that's a lover
[26:40] of the world she claims that she's born
[26:42] the second time to Christ but her lover
[26:45] notices Adam yet because she loves the
[26:48] world now all right very small amount of
[26:51] what to explain each point we talked
[26:54] about about the world it's not talking
[26:56] about whether you're living working
[26:58] uh doing this doing that we went through
[27:00] that Sunday it the world is plainly the
[27:03] old adamic nature of natural
[27:08] world and then you see the church you
[27:10] see that they come out of this but then
[27:14] they just go right back into the same
[27:16] thing until the church is now is the
[27:18] most worldly of all right right
[27:20] amen who who is it that you're having to
[27:23] talk about the the shorts the the you
[27:26] know you know understand but they claim
[27:29] to be born again
[27:31] right right that's what makes them
[27:34] adulterous all right and another thing
[27:37] notice what kind of a children she's
[27:38] burying just like
[27:40] her y that tells what their papa is
[27:43] whether it's the first Adam or second
[27:45] Adam if the church brings forth a child
[27:48] of the second Adam he acts the second
[27:50] Adam's way of acting right like they did
[27:52] at the day of Pentecost that's the
[27:54] second Adam that's Christ right that's a
[27:57] really true second Adam's children see
[27:59] right their nature is like his and hers
[28:02] yes sir her daughter is now going back
[28:04] to the other right painted face bobbed
[28:07] hired wearing men's clothing trousers
[28:09] the Bible said for her not to do it she
[28:13] cuts her high it's a shame to her all
[28:16] right now we go to number
[28:23] six
[28:25] okay now I'm trying toing break this
[28:27] down to where you'll see something from
[28:29] it this is still from the invisible
[28:31] Union all of these except the last part
[28:33] will be from invisible Union paragraph
[28:35] 212 now it was nature associated with
[28:37] death your first husband that had ruled
[28:39] over you was your Nature by natural
[28:41] birth natural you love the world because
[28:44] you are the world and part of the world
[28:45] that's right congregation says amen your
[28:48] desires was by nature to love the world
[28:51] which you're part of you're a part of
[28:52] nature you believe that amen that's your
[28:55] natural thing see that's why we just
[28:56] keep on going going and people go to
[28:58] churches and they just keep right on
[29:00] living the same old
[29:01] lives but yet they claim to be married
[29:04] to Christ right that's the reason you
[29:07] have to be born again you have to
[29:09] separate you have to die to that first
[29:14] husband now Mark that one because we're
[29:17] going to come back to that one all right
[29:21] I told you Sunday if you're listening to
[29:22] the message I gave about five different
[29:26] times what I was going to preach on
[29:29] tonight I wonder who wrote it down and
[29:31] checked out what I was doing or even
[29:33] went back and listened to the tape again
[29:35] so that's the reason you have to be born
[29:37] again you have to separate you have to
[29:38] die to that first husband now that's not
[29:40] talking about denominationalism that's
[29:42] talking about we need to burth right we
[29:45] don't blame denominationalism for us
[29:47] being lost right right
[29:51] right we blame the old adamic nature
[29:54] right you can't live with it you you
[29:57] just say well I'll divorce him and hang
[29:59] him up here till
[30:02] occasion so that's what you see churches
[30:04] and people doing
[30:05] right that's right they claim to be
[30:07] married to Christ and they do pretty
[30:08] good for a little while then after a
[30:09] while you see them right back in the
[30:11] same old rut they was in what happen

[31:40] white as wol 10,000 of 10,000 came with
[31:43] him to minister to him the the bride and
[31:46] then the books were open now see there's
[31:48] books there there's the Book of Life of
[31:52] the living and then there's a allow Book
[31:53] of Life which is not two books it's two
[31:55] sections of the same book right the
[31:57] invisible Union that answers it and
[31:59] another book was open which was The Book
[32:01] of Life see there is Saints already

[36:07] kept y all right now if that's not
[36:10] cleared y amen those deeds are still
[36:14] there amen that's right now what
[36:16] happened to those
[36:19] deeds well God put it in the SE of
[36:21] forgetfulness all right I love that but
[36:23] now we're going to get a little bit
[36:24] better word in just minutes so hang on
[36:27] you stand perfectly before God now your
[36:29] name is now in the new book not the book
[36:31] of life but the Lamb's Book of
[36:33] Life what the lamb redeem not the old

[36:46] Eternal Journey from the beginning takes
[36:47] hold now you're not only forgiven but
[36:50] you're Justified Glory Justified Romans
[36:53] 51 said what yeah Romans 51 said
[36:57] therefore being justified by
[36:59] faith Look up the word the word don't
[37:01] mean forgiven the word means Justified
[37:05] it don't mean you're forgiven nope
[37:07] that's right now remember in The
[37:09] Invisible Union your natural
[37:13] things a woman could be forgiven but
[37:17] never could be justified right yep
[37:20] because you can't restore that right

[37:25] true now but he ain't talk talking about
[37:27] your natural acts now he's talking about
[37:29] the new birth
[37:30] right all right so in the New Birth we
[37:33] can find that we're Justified you know
[37:36] the story for instance you heard I got
[37:38] drunk and done evil things and
[37:41] everything then you come around and say
[37:42] to me you found out I didn't do them see
[37:44] you found out then you come around and
[37:46] say brother ROM I forgive you forgive me
[37:48] I didn't do it at all didn't do it at
[37:50] the first place now if I didn't do it if
[37:53] now if I did do it I'm guilty right but
[37:57] you could forgive me and I wouldn't be
[37:59] guilty but yet I'm not justified because
[38:02] I actually done it y
[38:05] right but the word Justified is though
[38:07] you never done it
[38:10] amen and don't get it all confused as I
[38:13] said right the Natural Things of life
[38:17] that people done can be forgiven but
[38:20] they can't be justified amen that's
[38:22] right in your marital situation why
[38:25] because the new birth doesn't take that
[38:28] away as everybody you know people wants
[38:30] to think that and I'm not preaching the
[38:32] new birth I'm typing we'll get to that

[38:51] amen it's not even regarded at all yep
[38:54] how is it done
[38:57] how's it done that nothing is regarded
[38:59] to that soul to that individual to buy
[39:01] that new birth
[39:04] yep in God's book of sea of
[39:06] forgetfulness your old book and marriage
[39:09] is divorced and dead now watch if he had
[39:13] stopped on that divorce that's right it
[39:15] would have been a problem wouldn't he
[39:17] but he said
[39:18] divorced and dead

[39:26] amen you're Justified therefore being
[39:29] justified it was accused you was accused

[39:44] bridegroom bore your shame himself for
[39:46] you in your place he took your place for
[39:49] you were predestinated for him to be for

[43:29] me a sinner that I might become him the
[43:32] word amen amen let me hold true to it

[43:50] would happen in this day it's happening
[43:52] day by day when it's humal fast out
[43:54] there in the desert and things taking
[43:56] place that I couldn't even keep up with
[43:58] it we're near the coming of Jesus Christ

[44:19] the reason I want you to get this get
[44:21] what the new birth makes you m on the
[44:24] future home run around trying to explain
[44:26] the city and all and trying to he said

[44:38] complete you never sin it to first place
[44:41] how is it that you never
[44:42] sin you know you sin everybody else

[44:49] right you catch the key of how that that
[44:51] guy goes home with one I can go home
[44:53] with one wife and what happens to them
[44:55] other two
[45:01] it's in the SE of forgetfulness you
[45:03] never did it you were accused of it by
[45:05] the accuser but really from the
[45:07] beginning you were predestinated to be a
[45:08] son and daughter of God you're standing
[45:10] there wased and your old book of
[45:13] divorcement is put away Y and it's
[45:17] dead absolutely out of
[45:20] existence even in the mind of God now
[45:23] that's how perfect the new birth is
[45:26] You're The Virtuous bride of Christ
[45:28] washed in the blood of Christ precious
[45:30] virtuous sinless son of the Son of God
[45:33] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[45:35] word that he's Washed by the Water of
[45:38] his own blood that become flesh and
[45:40] manifested he might take you which were
[45:43] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[45:46] before the beginning the same as he was
[45:48] he was the great attribute of God Called
[45:50] Love
[45:53] what whatever you are you are Servants
[45:56] of God whatever God wants you to do
[45:59] where's your place God placed in the
[46:02] church Apostles and Prophet Pastor he
[46:04] placed that by virtue of his own
[46:06] predestination that you were there to
[46:07] begin with your first
[46:10] wedding was a
[46:15] nulled now you talking about wedding he
[46:17] ain't talking about marriage and divorce
[46:19] situation that's right he ain't talking
[46:21] about organized religion no he's talking
[46:24] about the New Birth amen
[46:27] right no your first wedding was no it
[46:31] was you never done it in the first
[46:36] place now how could that be because
[46:39] there's only one thing could do it what
[46:43] that God that would be God come down
[46:47] himself and took your place in the form
[46:51] of the Son of God Jesus Christ and
[46:53] washed you by the water of the washing
[46:55] of the Water by the word the word not
[46:58] the denomination see the word was you
[47:01] but if you won't stand in the water of
[47:03] the word how you going to be washed
[47:05] you're still as spotted as
[47:07] was where we up to got
[47:14] 272
[47:16] okay but I'm having to hold on to
[47:20] this okay we're up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 right
[47:23] right we've done covered seven okay
[47:27] now so we can
[47:32] see we can see as as the prophet would
[47:35] be covering it by the new birth We Stand
[47:39] perfectly totally sinless in the soul
[47:42] amen of the individual that's right not
[47:44] in body and spirit now because it
[47:46] doesn't take away those things you say
[47:49] oh yeah did M
[47:51] well why is your old husband still alive
[47:54] that's right
[47:58] why you thinking that
[48:00] y well if I'm perfectly that's in the
[48:03] soul amen ever born again believer is
[48:06] perfectly totally sinless in the
[48:08] presence of almighty God
[48:13] Amen and we're going to use some quotes
[48:15] now going to tie together with it so now
[48:18] listen so then now what are we going to
[48:20] do the new birth is a top
[48:24] mhm any of you that's got the notes you
[48:27] look down on the side of it you'll see
[48:28] to to to to
[48:30] to
[48:33] right but you see what's wrong with us
[48:36] church is even though our soul is born
[48:41] again
[48:44] we were married to organized
[48:48] religion and that's why I believe that
[48:50] he call married indivisible unions a
[48:52] greater
[48:54] portion because people would go there
[48:57] with two or three wives and go home free
[48:58] and say Glory Hallelujah I'm free but
[49:00] what did it change in them right back on
[49:03] to the same churches they come out of
[49:05] right Y and that's what some done when
[49:07] brother ROM passed away
[49:11] y
[49:16] now so God had to come
[49:19] down and give you and I a new
[49:22] birth that's right and we're going to
[49:24] read it in just a minute
[49:26] where brother R said God let it die
[49:32] amen see that's what happened to our old
[49:35] adamic
[49:39] nature but this you're looking at in the
[49:41] spirit that's within me is my old adamic
[49:43] nature still that's right it's not born
[49:46] again
[49:48] amen and it's subject to the world and
[49:51] the things of the world oh no I'm a
[49:53] Christian since I've become a Christian
[49:55] I had sin but like who was it Jack Cole
[49:58] said go sit down lady the biggest Li
[50:01] here good
[50:05] point see church is Christians who have
[50:08] sins amen
[50:10] right that's right and our biggest
[50:14] sin is our denominational thoughts we've
[50:18] had that's right
[50:22] amen you said they done they helped us
[50:24] yes they did now I've told you that I
[50:27] don't have to talk back to you here
[50:28] right somebody out there that's just
[50:30] hearing at one time might not understand
[50:32] me but this church understands me amen
[50:34] I'm not going to off on no kind of
[50:36] people right we all come from
[50:39] denominational yes
[50:41] sir to come into this message but did we
[50:45] come into the message and get rid of all
[50:46] of our
[50:48] denominationalism
[50:50] right why would a prophet
[50:54] say
[50:56] if he didn't have some
[50:58] problems now come on why would he say I
[51:02] would have made a horrible mistake
[51:04] that's right on that first seal if God
[51:06] hadn't to come down and straighten the
[51:08] it that's
[51:10] right that's right come on that's his
[51:15] words now you're making brother randam
[51:17] all messed up brother Rand wasn't all
[51:18] messed
[51:21] up but he had enough organizational ISM
[51:24] left in him until he needed something to
[51:26] set him free right and that's what the
[51:27] seals brought to the man amen right the
[51:31] Plan of Redemption
[51:33] amen all
[51:35] right and so we cover the new
[51:38] birth that makes that Soul perfect and
[51:41] pure and
[51:43] complete now let's go into the second
[51:47] stage to the basis of old denominational
[51:52] husband and brother R said every denom
[51:55] there is come out of Genesis that's
[51:58] right
[51:59] amen now no matter whether we ever
[52:02] belong to a church or
[52:05] not even the Beast organized the
[52:10] thing
[52:11] right organizational ISM has always
[52:18] been and always will
[52:20] be the Antichrist
[52:24] movement
[52:26] all right but those are good people out
[52:29] there brother Dale you know better to
[52:31] quote back with me on that do you know
[52:33] what I've been what I told you right
[52:35] those are great people out there some of
[52:37] those people out there make me and you
[52:38] ashamed ofel the lives they live and the
[52:40] things they that's right that's what
[52:42] bothers me amen come on brother it may
[52:44] not bother you but that bothers me
[52:50] amen you want to go with me with Walmart
[52:52] that Commerce
[52:54] sometime and you'll never go over there
[52:56] that you don't find a bunch of women
[52:59] with dresses dragging the ground and
[53:02] hard bonds tied around their heads and
[53:04] their things they're making their
[53:09] statement you know I'm telling the
[53:13] truth you know there's people that out
[53:15] there in the world that would dare not
[53:16] cut their
[53:20] hair it's like the Catholics would dare
[53:22] not even to have birth controls because
[53:24] why because they think it's contrary the
[53:28] word so don't don't get on it somebody
[53:31] out there now you you can misunderstand
[53:33] brother Dale but not this church and see
[53:35] if you ever need anybody just call back
[53:37] here in this church will tell you that
[53:38] this is the way I've always been amen
[53:41] I've always been one thing with you
[53:44] we've all got problems amen right but
[53:47] that's not to be justified and do
[53:49] nothing we're trying to get rid of
[53:53] them and do you know that the reason we
[53:56] can't understand one God correctly is
[54:00] why come on why is it you can't
[54:02] understand one God
[54:04] correctly because somebody taught you a
[54:06] trinity or a oness situation right so
[54:09] that's
[54:10] denominationalism all right so our soul
[54:13] can be perfectly totally ped by the
[54:15] baptism of the Holy
[54:18] Ghost now I'm going to put it in their
[54:21] hearts
[54:22] okay very few of you have ever claimed
[54:25] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:26] after you come here so you must have got
[54:28] it somewhere else yeah come on brother
[54:30] you got it I try to pre
[54:34] that so you mean you got it while you
[54:36] out there an organized religion I'll
[54:38] agree with you you did I'm not going to
[54:41] argue with you my point is you still
[54:44] have the same organization on mine
[54:49] yep right yep the new birth could be
[54:52] there amen but we still have the same
[54:54] organization ational
[54:57] mind see me and my
[55:01] idea you can't tell me that what most
[55:04] people
[55:07] say but now listen folks I'm going to
[55:09] put this
[55:11] blunt I said it the other day and I'm
[55:13] going to say it again if a dumb donkey
[55:14] tells you the truth and you reject that
[55:16] truth you got an organizational Spirit
[55:18] right amen the old husband's not dead
[55:21] that's
[55:22] right now that's right the old HB
[55:25] husband of organizational
[55:27] ISM what made
[55:30] Cain kill
[55:34] Abel yep cuz Kan thought he was right
[55:38] right that's
[55:40] right right what made Eve go wrong in
[55:44] the beast in the
[55:46] garden brother Rand said she thought she
[55:48] was right that's
[55:51] right now is that a good enough case to
[55:53] lay it down to see what organization ism
[55:56] is I'm not against that church over
[55:59] there you heard brother random say it
[56:01] I'm not against people he said I'm
[56:03] against a system amen that organizes
[56:07] contrary to the word that won't take
[56:10] what the Bible says
[56:13] right that's what we're
[56:16] against and so is it with the people of
[56:18] this message see it won't take what the
[56:20] prophet said
[56:22] amen even worse than organizing religion
[56:25] you know me I've never been out there
[56:27] beating on them across the street over
[56:28] here right I do anything in the world I
[56:31] could for them
[56:33] people and could probably preach
[56:37] Freer right in some of
[56:40] them I know my nephew invited Wade to
[56:42] come and preach for
[56:46] him and my nephew told him said if you
[56:48] hold anything back it's your
[56:51] problem you tell it like it is
[56:55] you know might find some better spirits
[56:59] out there right that still don't change
[57:01] nothing does that's right cuz we're
[57:03] trying to get rid of organizational
[57:07] am you remember that brother that left
[57:11] church up there because that they uh
[57:14] their church is so and so o
[57:18] g.org
[57:20] org organizational you know the man left
[57:23] the church been going for years on count
[57:25] that he had a great Revelation didn't
[57:29] he but you understand now where we're
[57:31] going to stage two is everybody clear we
[57:33] cleared stage
[57:35] one how is it you're born
[57:37] again you got to die
[57:41] right now how can you
[57:47] die so we'll read it in a minute the
[57:50] better word of using God let it die
[57:53] that's right that's
[57:56] ah God let that old
[57:59] nature that you and I were born
[58:01] with and that's the guy we feed all the
[58:05] time in the body and spirit realm of us
[58:08] is still hooked up in organizational ISM
[58:10] amen God let the nature of that Soul how
[58:14] did he do that you answer me how could
[58:16] he come down and drop down into your
[58:18] soul and give it eternal life
[58:23] right that's hard to comprehend is
[58:26] that's right yes
[58:28] sir he had to BU P all of his do I like
[58:31] what brother BR we read there God came
[58:33] down y so God let that old nature
[58:38] die
[58:40] right
[58:42] he
[58:44] uned your marriage y to the old
[58:51] nature he divorced it but remember I
[58:55] kept saying it I rephrase again
[58:59] see he killed it
[59:06] yep
[59:08] now if I went there with three
[59:13] wives and I came home with
[59:17] one what happened to those
[59:23] two
[59:27] follow
[59:30] amen so now let's go
[59:35] to quote number two
[59:41] brother let's talk about this old
[59:47] husband let's go down just to paragraph
[59:50] 57 all right so is the church when when
[59:54] she tries to mix Creed and denomination
[59:57] with the word of
[59:58] God she can't be married to a
[1:00:01] denomination and be the bride at the
[1:00:04] same
[1:00:05] time she's got to be dead to one or the
[1:00:11] other watch this one or the
[1:00:15] other watch these dead and he let it die
[1:00:20] and the
[1:00:22] things the law says so here there's
[1:00:24] plenty of laws in God's word that's the
[1:00:26] law Paul speaking the same here she
[1:00:28] cannot be married to a church of worldly
[1:00:31] Creed and be the bride of Christ because
[1:00:34] she is contrary to the other now you
[1:00:38] remember
[1:00:40] that go to number
[1:00:45] three and now remember what's up here is
[1:00:48] what we're talking about
[1:00:51] amen now she is a woman if she is
[1:00:53] married to Christ the word she cannot be
[1:00:55] married to a church denomination at the
[1:00:57] same
[1:00:58] time or she's Bound by it she shall she
[1:01:02] cannot live with both husbands at the
[1:01:04] same
[1:01:05] time come on they're contrary one to the
[1:01:09] other one is God sent the other one is
[1:01:11] manmade so they contrary said let every
[1:01:14] man's word be a lie mine be true God
[1:01:16] said just as much contrary to one
[1:01:19] another as law was to Grace as Paul's
[1:01:22] speaking of here one one must be dead to
[1:01:25] have the other and if she's married
[1:01:28] tries to mix them excuse as she tries to
[1:01:31] mix them she shall be called an
[1:01:34] adulteress he's talking about the church
[1:01:37] right
[1:01:39] right he talking about the bride
[1:01:42] right oh no no no he talking about well
[1:01:45] he's dividing between he's getting the
[1:01:46] bride putting her there if you can't
[1:01:49] read go
[1:01:52] ahead Paul's speaking here she tries to
[1:01:54] mix them she shall be called an
[1:01:56] adulterous oh think of it New York
[1:01:58] Arizona Across the Nation think of it
[1:02:00] God said if she's if she tried to be
[1:02:03] married to two at the same time she
[1:02:06] shall be called an adulteress what
[1:02:08] adulteress can enter Heaven would God
[1:02:11] marry an adulteress certainly not he
[1:02:13] asked us not to do it she shall be
[1:02:15] called an adulteress he's talking about
[1:02:17] the bride of Christ right right you oh
[1:02:21] no no that well read the look
[1:02:26] right amen the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:30] Christ our problem is is we're caught in
[1:02:33] organizational
[1:02:37] ISM if you don't think that's right go
[1:02:40] out there in the message and just listen
[1:02:41] to some of the doctrines worse than it
[1:02:44] is in any organized religion the Baptist
[1:02:47] ain't that messed up right
[1:02:50] right you don't like that just take it h
[1:02:55] but look
[1:02:59] now where' we go to
[1:03:02] 71 contrary one to another you shall be
[1:03:05] called in adulterous all right go to
[1:03:07] number
[1:03:13] five paragraph
[1:03:16] 153 so to be married to the second Adam
[1:03:19] Christ now the second Adam is
[1:03:23] y the old was the first Adam was your
[1:03:27] lost nature of the soul the second Adam
[1:03:29] was Jesus Christ the Savior now watch
[1:03:31] what he said so to be married to the
[1:03:33] second Adam of Christ the word you must
[1:03:35] separate yourself by Death from your
[1:03:37] first denominational husband that's
[1:03:39] right okay amen because there isn't a
[1:03:43] one of them that can take all the word
[1:03:44] of God just show me where that one is at
[1:03:47] oh you say mine
[1:03:50] Lula come on the other fell says his
[1:03:54] twoo put them together and you find out
[1:03:56] you're both wrong soon as you denominate

[1:04:02] the dead got to be dead from that
[1:04:05] thing he said I'm not speaking to this
[1:04:08] local assembly I'm speaking all together
[1:04:10] Across the Nation you must be dead to
[1:04:13] your first husband if you're United to
[1:04:16] Christ and still married to a
[1:04:18] denomination you're an adulterous you
[1:04:20] are a lady of
[1:04:22] sea now I know because I feel a rebound
[1:04:25] maybe off the tape I need to
[1:04:27] explain but I feel a thought coming see
[1:04:30] that saying well how can we be born
[1:04:32] again in the
[1:04:34] soul and still be in a denominationalism

[1:04:51] mouth but I'm trying to tell you the new
[1:04:53] birth is a birth birth of the Soul amen
[1:04:55] that's right you could be born again out

[1:04:59] religion but you're not going to stay
[1:05:01] there when you hear the truth you'll
[1:05:03] come to it that's
[1:05:04] right see because that Holy Spirit will
[1:05:08] will bring you to the
[1:05:12] word so you be sitting right now this is

[1:05:27] wor that if we don't get things right
[1:05:28] we're not going to walk out of here
[1:05:30] that's right we're going by the
[1:05:32] grave that's what I've tried to tell you
[1:05:34] for 40 years that the biggest portion of
[1:05:37] people this message are going to go by

[1:06:29] mhm the church cross the nation we're
[1:06:32] following Jesus Christ the word to be in
[1:06:35] the bride you have to be remarried to
[1:06:36] the word of God which is Christ now why
[1:06:40] would he be preaching something like

[1:06:54] hope you can understand
[1:06:56] it the word which is Christ in the
[1:06:58] beginning was the word word with God and
[1:07:00] Word was God and the word made flesh and
[1:07:02] go on as long as you hold to man's
[1:07:04] tradition of denomination you are called
[1:07:06] in God's word and adultery as long as
[1:07:09] you're a denominational Creed Seeker
[1:07:11] belonging to a denominational church
[1:07:13] that denies the word you are an
[1:07:16] adulterous what the Bible said and
[1:07:19] that's why I said it over and over to
[1:07:20] you the people this message is just as
[1:07:22] messed up so it's this as big a
[1:07:24] denomination as there is anywhere else
[1:07:26] so you know I'm not throwing off on
[1:07:28] people out there across the street over
[1:07:30] here that's right I'm talking about me
[1:07:32] and you amen that's right that's right
[1:07:34] come
[1:07:36] on Jesus said you cannot serve two Gods
[1:07:39] at the same time you either serve God or
[1:07:41] Mammon mamom is the world he that loves
[1:07:45] the world or the things of the world the
[1:07:47] love of God is not even in him the seed
[1:07:49] of God can't be in him the same time the
[1:07:52] love of God now watch you the love of
[1:07:54] the world is in there when the seat of
[1:07:57] God is operating through you that's the
[1:07:59] word of God the love of the world can't
[1:08:02] be in there at the same time now where
[1:08:04] is the short High and the shorts and the
[1:08:06] painy face and you know where's it

[1:08:35] what it is now right it wouldn't even
[1:08:38] look like a religious Society to now

[1:23:58] go through it with
[1:23:59] you just some things if you want to read
[1:24:02] it Romans 6:1 what shall we say then
[1:24:05] shall we continue to sin that Grace May
[1:24:07] abound God forbid how shall we that are
[1:24:10] dead to sin live any longer therein yep
[1:24:15] know ye not that so many of us as we
[1:24:17] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:24:20] into his death amen therefore we are
[1:24:22] buried with him by baptism into death
[1:24:25] that like as Christ was raised from the
[1:24:26] dead by the glory of the father even so
[1:24:28] we Al we also should walk in newness of
[1:24:31] life for if we have been planted
[1:24:33] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:24:36] shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:24:38] resurrection knowing this that our old
[1:24:40] man is crucified with him amen that the
[1:24:43] body of sin amen might be
[1:24:47] destroyed and henceforth we should not
[1:24:50] serve
[1:24:51] sin
[1:24:52] this is the body of sin
[1:24:55] amen we've got to realize it's dead amen
[1:24:59] all right for he that is dead is free
[1:25:02] from sin I'm read scripture Romans 6
[1:25:08] 1-7 now if we be dead with Christ we
[1:25:11] believe that we shall also live with him
[1:25:13] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:25:15] the dead dieth no more death has no more
[1:25:17] dominion over
[1:25:20] him right for in that he died he died
[1:25:24] under sin once but in that he liveth he
[1:25:27] liveth under
[1:25:28] God likewise there likewise reckon you
[1:25:31] also yourselves to be dead indeed under
[1:25:35] sin but alive under God through Jesus
[1:25:38] Christ Our Lord but now we are delivered
[1:25:40] from the law that being dead wherein we
[1:25:44] were held right that's it amen we were
[1:25:47] dead y he gave you a new
[1:25:50] birth that we should Ser in uness of
[1:25:53] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:25:54] letter but she that liveth in pleasure
[1:25:56] is dead while she liveth amen there's
[1:26:00] the worldly Church system that's it dead
[1:26:02] once he living
[1:26:05] yep who his own self by our sins in his
[1:26:09] own body on the tree that we being dead
[1:26:12] to sins now this is from first Peter
[1:26:15] that LIC was from 1 Timothy 5:6 this is
[1:26:18] 1 Peter 2:24 who his own self our sins
[1:26:23] in his own body on the tree that we
[1:26:25] being dead to sin should live under
[1:26:27] righteousness by who by whose Stripes ye
[1:26:30] are healed amen listen
[1:26:34] church as far as God was
[1:26:39] concerned if you went there with two
[1:26:43] wies and saw the grace of marriage and
[1:26:46] divorce or if you see it tonight by the
[1:26:49] opening of the
[1:26:50] word thank you Lord
[1:26:53] if you can see it you can see that old
[1:26:56] husband is
[1:26:59] dead if you went there with three wives
[1:27:01] and went home with one where as God is
[1:27:05] concerned those other two are dead yep
[1:27:08] dead not in the bases of natural
[1:27:11] life but dead in the existence of a
[1:27:14] connection to
[1:27:16] you but it's really an embarrassing
[1:27:18] situation right cuz you marry a woman
[1:27:21] and you got a kid by you divorce her and
[1:27:24] you marry another and you got a kid by
[1:27:26] you marry number three and you got a kid
[1:27:28] by you got three kids all by different
[1:27:30] women what are you going to do throw
[1:27:32] away the other two that's not yours you
[1:27:34] know in the bases of trying to come home
[1:27:36] from marriage and divorce and come home
[1:27:38] with one wife and one kid what are you
[1:27:40] going to do
[1:27:43] no right I've done preach to you what I
[1:27:46] said you ought to do go to take care of
[1:27:48] them kids the rest of their Liv amen
[1:27:51] they're yours amen you're Duty bound to
[1:27:56] them well I'm not going to do it well
[1:27:58] then you're not a Christian that's solve
[1:28:01] the problem get mad at me you're not a
[1:28:06] Christian what I told you about Paul
[1:28:08] Paul was faced with polygamous
[1:28:11] situations people there with 10 wives
[1:28:13] maybe or
[1:28:15] more cuz it just coming over into to the
[1:28:18] New Testament
[1:28:20] form I be Paul said you pick out which
[1:28:23] one's yours and you go home with her and
[1:28:25] you ain't living to the rest of them but
[1:28:26] you better make sure the rest of them
[1:28:28] kids is took care of that's right that's
[1:28:30] right amen you see you don't have no
[1:28:32] proof of that now you don't have no
[1:28:33] proof that I ain't right either
[1:28:36] M that's
[1:28:39] right because I believe it's time to to
[1:28:42] settle it all that's right you see you
[1:28:45] might have come here
[1:28:46] tonight two or three wives or two or
[1:28:48] three
[1:28:49] husbands but you can really believe it
[1:28:53] the only way you can be free from them
[1:28:55] Brother Gary is for that husband or that
[1:28:57] wife to be dead that's
[1:29:01] scripture she married to another man
[1:29:03] while her husband's still living but now
[1:29:06] watch she can't go divorce it and start
[1:29:09] over again no that's right but if she
[1:29:12] went there with two husbands she'd come
[1:29:14] home with one husband
[1:29:18] right that other husband is dead
[1:29:22] as far as God is
[1:29:24] concerned and it better be as far as
[1:29:26] you're concerned that's right that's
[1:29:29] right cuz wouldn't that be something
[1:29:31] like brother R said hang up in the
[1:29:32] closet what do you think he's talking
[1:29:36] about that's right you get mad at your
[1:29:39] wife get mad at the husband run back
[1:29:40] over there and py patter her around a
[1:29:42] little bit with the old wife or
[1:29:47] husband I tell you what I'm a mean old
[1:29:50] man I know it
[1:29:54] but don't you ever the you that have
[1:29:56] been married to or three times don't you
[1:29:58] ever start comparing your husband or
[1:30:00] your wife with the former one you had
[1:30:02] that's right that's right I'll tell you
[1:30:04] one thing that is not the Holy Spirit
[1:30:07] no that's right you go live from where
[1:30:10] you are straight
[1:30:14] on
[1:30:16] yep don't say well boy you you just
[1:30:19] don't cook like my first wife
[1:30:23] or you don't smell like my first
[1:30:26] husband I try to make it funny where you
[1:30:28] life instead of making it too hard and
[1:30:31] strong we're talking about Christianity
[1:30:34] folks that's right like I said while ago
[1:30:37] how can you tell a woman that that keeps
[1:30:39] on cutting her heart yep and she says
[1:30:42] she's a Christian right and you tell her
[1:30:45] she's
[1:30:47] lost
[1:30:49] right she don't like it
[1:30:55] she don't like
[1:31:00] it but you see church it's time to lay
[1:31:02] it on the line amen right I hope you
[1:31:06] understand I'm going to go through it
[1:31:07] one more time but I don't want this
[1:31:08] misunderstood because that's the only
[1:31:10] way that I've ever seen that I could
[1:31:11] explain
[1:31:13] it by that new birth God let that old
[1:31:16] adamic nature that we had die amen so he
[1:31:20] could come and live into us and give us
[1:31:22] a new
[1:31:24] birth our old denominational
[1:31:28] husband our ideas and things that are
[1:31:31] contrary to the word thank you Lord God
[1:31:33] let it die but sometimes we still
[1:31:36] hanging on to
[1:31:37] it well I got a right to believe what I
[1:31:39] want to you're not a Christian when you
[1:31:42] say you got a right to believe what you
[1:31:43] want to is that blunt enough you're not
[1:31:46] a Christian Christians don't have rights
[1:31:48] we forfeit every one of
[1:31:50] them right
[1:31:53] well so is it with marriage and divorce
[1:31:54] of Grace yes sir
[1:31:58] right that person went home that day
[1:32:00] with one wife and one
[1:32:04] husband they set free right that old
[1:32:08] husband or old wife was
[1:32:13] dead it better be dead to
[1:32:18] you not hung up in a closet no that's
[1:32:23] right do you understand what I'm saying
[1:32:26] is our old husband
[1:32:31] dead is our old denominationalism
[1:32:36] dead is our natural wife or natural
[1:32:38] husband are the
[1:32:46] dead God let it die that's right if
[1:32:49] we'll let it die right
[1:32:53] there's where the problem is God let it
[1:32:54] die
[1:32:56] M but if we let it we let it die
[1:33:04] that's see church then that way Christ
[1:33:07] can come and
[1:33:09] live people that walk off of this Earth
[1:33:11] in a Rapture and a chain them M TW go
[1:33:14] now their husband going to be
[1:33:16] dead they may see him every day walk in
[1:33:19] the
[1:33:20] streets they may see them every time
[1:33:22] they go to
[1:33:25] Walmart and Heaven help you to turn your
[1:33:28] nose
[1:33:30] up that's right just say Heidi how you
[1:33:33] doing and
[1:33:35] welome don't take you four hours to do
[1:33:38] that does
[1:33:40] it we got a little time
[1:33:48] we'll so we can talk no we can't talk
[1:33:52] we don't have nothing to talk about
[1:33:54] except
[1:33:55] Christianity invite them to church
[1:33:58] right let be too
[1:34:01] embarrassing you mean you don't want
[1:34:03] people
[1:34:04] stay what holy and pous idea you got
[1:34:10] right come on
[1:34:13] folks it's time to get it down flat
[1:34:17] right why wouldn't you want an old
[1:34:19] husband or an old wife that you had
[1:34:22] sitting down here here in the gospel
[1:34:23] that's right
[1:34:28] right probably wrong
[1:34:30] way well I just couldn't do that cuz I'd
[1:34:33] be nervous and be I thought she was born
[1:34:41] again come
[1:34:42] on I thought we was born
[1:34:50] again what about
[1:34:54] it of any of the three situations that
[1:34:56] we talked about is our old husband
[1:35:00] dead God let it die but if we let it die
[1:35:04] that's right that's
[1:35:06] right or do we keep digging it
[1:35:11] up come on Brothers we keep digging it
[1:35:14] up that's
[1:35:17] try any questions any thoughts anybody
[1:35:20] has
[1:35:22] right them down we'll be glad to try to
[1:35:24] cover
[1:35:26] them try to help us to
[1:35:30] see a way to see that the old husband is
[1:35:34] dead God let it die don't ever forget
[1:35:37] that
[1:35:38] statement God let it die that's
[1:35:42] right that's what Grace is Grace is
