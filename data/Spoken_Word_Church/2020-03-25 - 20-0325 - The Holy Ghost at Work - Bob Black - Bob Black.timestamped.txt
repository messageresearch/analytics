[0:00] relax brother Bob comes to minister the
[0:02] word of the Lord unto us and pray that
[0:05] God would open her eyes of our
[0:07] understanding that's the main thing
[0:09] right let's just sing that open the eyes
[0:12] of my heart Lord open the eyes of my
[0:22] [Music]
[0:28] services now Sunday will stay like it is
[0:30] until we tell you a change
[0:37] [Music]
[1:24] and we sing
[1:29] [Music]
[1:33] holy holy
[1:37] Oh
[1:39] [Music]
[1:47] to see
[1:51] amen I saw a desire to not greet you in
[1:55] the name of the Lord all the ones that
[1:57] are at home and the ones that are here
[1:58] it's a small little group but you know I
[2:02] was thinking I just to quote mr. Rogers
[2:07] he said he said his mama used to tell
[2:10] him when emergencies and things would
[2:12] happen bad things would happened and you
[2:15] could look around and see all the you
[2:18] see all the people helping out and I see
[2:20] all the helpers kind of and you know
[2:22] when bad bad things kind of come on the
[2:25] scene it really exposes a lot of good in
[2:28] people you can see we think about how
[2:30] all the things we've got to be thankful
[2:31] look for tonight we've got all these all
[2:34] these nurses here that our sister Sarah
[2:37] and and I'm forgetting somebody's sister
[2:39] Ruth and all the different ones that are
[2:43] Amy that's right that are that are
[2:46] working hard and and then and then this
[2:48] group here that's come together and we
[2:49] thank brother Dale and brother way for
[2:51] you know opening up the church so that
[2:53] we could keep keep this going so we're
[2:59] just so grateful you know I was thinking
[3:00] coming up the road tonight what we're
[3:02] serving the great Shepherd and and he's
[3:05] the Bible says he's the door of the
[3:07] sheepfold and if he's the door that
[3:10] means nothing can come in and get the
[3:11] Sheep unless the Shepherd allows it
[3:14] unless you kind of test aside for a
[3:15] little bit just kind of train us up or
[3:18] get us get us home down I believe it's
[3:21] honing down time art our faith is being
[3:23] hold up a little bit sometimes it takes
[3:26] a little bit of pressure and things to
[3:27] to kind of see what we're made of but I
[3:29] believe this it's time so listen tonight
[3:33] I'm gonna read from Philippians chapter
[3:35] 1 verse 6 and just just a real just one
[3:38] verse really and they will go into the
[3:41] message let's just go to the Lord in
[3:43] prayer well God we're so grateful to you
[3:45] tonight Lord a bit to be able to gather
[3:47] together around your word Lord and and
[3:49] we know your your bride is not really
[3:52] even located in one particular place but
[3:54] spread all around the world and tonight
[3:56] Lord we're spread amongst all our
[3:58] different homes and but
[3:59] we're come we're gathering together just
[4:01] the same around your word Lord and as we
[4:04] all gather together around your word
[4:06] where the carcasses the Eagles will be
[4:07] gather together as the scripture says
[4:09] Lord I pray Lord that you will open the
[4:11] eyes of our understanding and help us to
[4:13] Lord to be encouraged tonight and to be
[4:15] edified and that something will be said
[4:17] to strengthen your little bride and to
[4:18] give faith to her we ask Lord Jesus that
[4:21] you'll be with us tonight not just in
[4:23] this building but in all the little
[4:24] homes that are separated all tonight
[4:26] Lord because of the conditions and
[4:28] things that you'll be a neat little home
[4:29] Lord a little lick of fire everywhere
[4:31] Lord we ask Lord Jesus these things in
[4:34] your name amen so Philippians chapter 1
[4:39] verse 6 says being confident of this
[4:41] very thing that he which hath begun a
[4:43] good work in you will perform it until
[4:45] the day of Jesus Christ you may be
[4:48] seated the Lord is blessing to the
[4:50] reading of the word now tonight I want
[4:53] to take maybe a kind of a strange topic
[4:56] I just want to talk about the Holy Ghost
[4:58] at work
[4:59] and and this is not gonna be a really
[5:02] deep lesson or anything I just want to
[5:03] kind of take a look at at the change
[5:05] that the Holy Ghost will wrought in the
[5:07] lives of the disciples you'll have to
[5:09] change that the Holy Ghost has wrought
[5:11] in the lives of us and the thing that
[5:13] the things that the Holy Ghost is doing
[5:16] us in us to identify us with the were
[5:18] doing encourage us and help us and when
[5:21] I'm talking about the Holy Ghost the
[5:23] Holy Spirit I'm talking about the that
[5:25] that thing that in sundry times in
[5:27] divers manners spoke to the Father see
[5:29] the prophets that thing that in the in
[5:31] the Old Testament it said the spirit
[5:32] moved over the waters and and out from
[5:36] the earth came forth all those seeds
[5:38] that were lying there that sprouted up
[5:41] that that spirit that was in Jesus
[5:43] Christ and when that spirit came back in
[5:45] that in that dead body that was laying
[5:47] in the tomb that spirit rose up that
[5:49] body and caused him to come forth from
[5:51] the tomb that spirit that the Bible says
[5:54] if that same spirit is in you it will
[5:56] quicken your mortal body just the same
[5:58] way is that quicken Jesus as dead body
[6:01] laying there at a tomb with that that
[6:02] spirit will quicken your body so you see
[6:05] the Holy Ghost is it worked many times
[6:07] that look at my scene because of
[6:08] circumstances and things you get down in
[6:11] life and it looks like the Holy Ghost is
[6:13] still not moving that God is still not
[6:14] with you the Bible says he was is a
[6:17] present help in time of need he is all
[6:19] he'll never leave you or forsake you the
[6:22] Holy Ghost is the thing that brings the
[6:24] word to life it's the thing that will
[6:26] bring bringing that dead letter to life
[6:29] off of the page of the Bible it living
[6:31] living inside of you you see the Bible
[6:35] says that if you if you can just open up
[6:38] your heart to let that spirit in to
[6:40] quicken the word that you've heard then
[6:41] that that puts God Himself inside of you
[6:45] that's what that spirit will produce
[6:47] let's see let's read that first the
[6:49] first quote in Jesus Christ the same
[6:51] yesterday today in forever he said if
[6:53] the Christian Church is the vine or the
[6:56] branch that's in Christ they'll do the
[6:58] works of Christ and bear the life of
[7:01] Christ
[7:02] by their fruits you shall know them now
[7:04] then the way that he is today he's here
[7:07] in the form of the holy spirit working
[7:09] through his church performing the same
[7:12] things that he did there that makes him
[7:15] the same yesterday today and forever his
[7:18] life the life that was in Christ which
[7:20] was God produced the kind of a life that
[7:22] he lived in that same life comes into
[7:25] his churches his church members since
[7:28] they have been purged by the blood and
[7:30] given the Holy Spirit access to work
[7:32] through them bears the same fruit that
[7:34] he bore so therefore the world can see
[7:37] then that Christ is the same yesterday
[7:39] today and forever so there we kind of
[7:42] start off with the identification of the
[7:44] characteristics of the holy spirit the
[7:46] holy spirit and you would produce that
[7:49] same life that was in Jesus Christ and I
[7:51] believe tonight that we should be
[7:53] looking for that in our lives we should
[7:54] be looking for the for the impossible we
[7:56] should be looking for the miraculous
[7:58] because when you become when you become
[8:00] expecting to see God move on the scene
[8:02] than you you will see miracles you will
[8:05] see signs and wonders follow the Bible
[8:07] says the son
[8:08] and waters would follow them to believe
[8:09] why because the holy spirit within them
[8:12] is the one that is producing the effect
[8:14] of them believing the Holy Spirit in you
[8:17] is the one that agrees with the word
[8:19] it's the one that is doing the thing it
[8:21] is the one that per foot is performing
[8:23] his word you see what as we kind of get
[8:26] into the lesson tonight the the Holy
[8:29] Spirit had an effect on the lives of the
[8:31] disciples when it fell on them at the
[8:33] day of Pentecost it changed their whole
[8:35] makeup it changed their whole attitude
[8:37] and it began to produce in them the life
[8:41] of Christ and what happened on the day
[8:43] of Pentecost was it made them witnesses
[8:45] of of an experience it made them
[8:47] witnesses that something had happened to
[8:49] them they could go forth and tell us as
[8:51] Peter went down downstairs from the
[8:53] upper room he wouldn't begin to proclaim
[8:56] what had happened to him that this is
[8:58] that and he identified it with the
[8:59] scripture he was a witness and when when
[9:02] the Holy Spirit begins to do something
[9:04] in your life it makes you a witness that
[9:06] you know that something has happened you
[9:08] know that the Holy Spirit has come upon
[9:10] you and filled you with us with his
[9:12] power and changed you and taking you
[9:14] from out of the world and change you to
[9:17] make you like Jesus Christ the book of
[9:20] Acts it says in chapter 1 verse 6 it
[9:23] says when they were therefore come
[9:24] together they asked of him saying Lord
[9:27] wilt thou at this time restore the
[9:29] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[9:30] it is not for you to know the times or
[9:32] the seasons which the father had put in
[9:34] his own power but ye shall receive power
[9:37] after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
[9:39] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[9:41] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[9:44] in Samaria and unto the uttermost part
[9:46] of the earth you're going to be a
[9:47] witness in other words a witness a
[9:49] witness means to have a knowledge of an
[9:52] event or a change from personal
[9:54] observation or experience you were there
[9:56] when it happened and and along and along
[9:59] it along through your through your
[10:01] Christian journey you're gonna be a
[10:02] witness of all the things that have
[10:04] happened to you at the time that you got
[10:05] sick for the time that you lost your job
[10:07] at the time that everybody around you
[10:09] has fallen sick - a plague but whatever
[10:11] it might be and you can look back and
[10:13] say I was a witness that God was on the
[10:16] scene he came down when
[10:18] he didn't leave me alone he didn't leave
[10:21] me helpless and Deuteronomy chapter 31 6
[10:24] it says be strong and of a good courage
[10:26] fear not nor be afraid of him or of all
[10:29] the enemy that in the land that they
[10:30] were coming to for the Lord thy God he
[10:32] it is said doeth that does go with thee
[10:35] he will not fail thee nor forsake you
[10:38] and that's the scripture that Paul
[10:40] quoted in Hebrews when he said the Bible
[10:42] says that I will never leave you look
[10:44] forsake you he is a present help he is a
[10:46] God that's what the Holy Spirit does in
[10:48] your life if you'll just yield yourself
[10:51] to him and let him come in and work with
[10:52] you and move in your life he will be
[10:54] there they take care of your problems
[10:56] he'll be there to handle the things that
[10:58] you can't do within yourself because
[11:01] what it what it does is it makes you a
[11:03] witness that God is able that God is
[11:06] faithful that God is present
[11:08] he's a present help that God is working
[11:11] the Holy Spirit is working on the scene
[11:13] he's moving you're a witness that you're
[11:16] not afraid to take the witness stand
[11:18] because you know what you've seen and
[11:21] what you've experienced that's what
[11:24] Jesus told Nicodemus he said you must be
[11:27] born again the born again his experience
[11:30] is something you could try to explain
[11:31] and you can try to tell somebody but
[11:33] it's something that you can only know if
[11:35] you have experienced it for yourself you
[11:37] must be born again and I encourage you
[11:40] implore you in this hour this hour is
[11:42] more than ever you should be looking
[11:44] upon the things that are happening and
[11:46] realizing that you need to run to the
[11:49] cross that you need to run to the altar
[11:51] and seek deliver a pit for the hours at
[11:54] hand I believe I believe that now is the
[11:56] time now is the manifestation time and
[12:00] the end time avenge ilysm brother
[12:02] Branham says in 1962 he said now today
[12:05] we try to take the written word we have
[12:07] in letter form creed form and so forth
[12:09] to all the world and there's been
[12:10] missionaries going everywhere but what
[12:12] do we find when we get there a native
[12:15] that can't read his name holding a tract
[12:17] in his hand he knows no more about it
[12:20] that he does which is which is right and
[12:22] left hand but when jesus said go and
[12:25] preach the gospel he never said teach
[12:27] the word
[12:28] I don't believe he's meaning that we
[12:29] don't need teachers what he's made it is
[12:31] we don't need a laying out of it to
[12:34] replace going into the Holy of Holies
[12:36] for yourself if you look to somebody
[12:39] else to give you an explanation that
[12:40] that bypasses you going for your own
[12:43] personal experience you going through
[12:45] justification sanctification baptism and
[12:48] Holy Ghost going into the Holy of Holies
[12:50] where you look God in the face and you
[12:52] know for your own self that God is real
[12:54] that's the kind of teaching that we
[12:56] don't need he said never said teach the
[12:59] word he said preach the gospel and the
[13:01] gospel came not in word only but through
[13:03] the manifestation of the word for the
[13:05] only way that it could be done was to
[13:07] make his promise come to pass and I
[13:09] believe that's what the preacher of the
[13:11] gospel does did I did push the Holy
[13:13] Ghost into action because when the word
[13:15] goes forth and you sit there and you
[13:17] open yourself up to it and you say that
[13:18] it's got to be the truth that God begins
[13:21] to effect a change in your life
[13:23] someone God can read like that in
[13:25] William Jennings Bryan when he was
[13:27] debating with Derek Darrell on the door
[13:29] ethics of Darwin see he could only say
[13:31] what Darwin had said William Jennings
[13:33] Bryan could see what the Bible had said
[13:35] that was the debate but in this case God
[13:38] comes along the people and proves that
[13:40] his word is made manifest and the only
[13:42] way you can do that is not by track but
[13:45] by the Holy Spirit working through you
[13:47] your life becomes his life he's in you
[13:50] do you realize that's the kind of change
[13:53] that the Holy Spirit makes the Holy
[13:55] Spirit makes the Word of God manifested
[13:58] in your life so much that you become the
[14:00] proof of the scripture your life is the
[14:02] proof that the word is true because God
[14:04] is making that word that you have read
[14:07] come to life it is living in you a
[14:09] living voice a live device to living out
[14:11] in you thundering out you say well how
[14:15] do I get healed
[14:16] Paul the Gospel of Mark says and he said
[14:19] unto them go you into all the world and
[14:21] preach the gospel to every creature he
[14:23] that believeth and is baptized shall be
[14:25] saved but he that believeth not shall be
[14:27] damned and these signs shall follow them
[14:29] that believe in my name shall they cast
[14:31] out Devils they shall speak with new
[14:33] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[14:35] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[14:37] not hurt them
[14:38] thank you
[14:38] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[14:40] recover in other words this is not a
[14:42] dead religion that we're following this
[14:44] is a living manifestation of the power
[14:46] of God the power of God is still in this
[14:49] church because the Holy Ghost is still
[14:51] working the Holy Ghost is still affects
[14:53] you all these people it makes you a
[14:56] witness because you have lived some
[14:59] through something in John chapter 4
[15:01] verse 23 23 Jesus was talking to the
[15:04] woman at the whale and he said the hour
[15:05] cometh and now is when the true
[15:07] worshipers shall worship the father in
[15:09] spirit and in truth for the father
[15:11] seeketh such to worship Him God is a
[15:14] spirit and they that worship Him must
[15:15] worship in spirit and truth and as he
[15:17] began to speak to her about those things
[15:20] something quickening her not to take her
[15:23] to a new birth experience because Jesus
[15:25] had not died yet but she began to she
[15:27] began to realize who it was that was
[15:28] talking to her in the spirit began to
[15:30] work in our life and she began she ran
[15:33] into the city to be a witness to tell
[15:34] who she had talked to in 1st Kings
[15:38] chapter 17 13 to 14 that says it Elijah
[15:40] said to her fear not go and do as thou
[15:43] has said but make me thereof a little
[15:45] kick first and bring it unto me and
[15:47] after make for thee and for thy son for
[15:49] thus saith the Lord God of Israel the
[15:51] barrel of meal shall not waste neither
[15:53] shall the cruse have all failed until
[15:55] the day that the Lord send us rain upon
[15:57] the earth and that little woman became a
[15:59] witness that she obeyed the word of the
[16:01] prophet that God kept her through
[16:03] perilous times because she was a witness
[16:05] that God did not depart her in the time
[16:07] of trouble in the time of need
[16:09] she was a witness you see what the Holy
[16:15] Ghost does is it transformed it
[16:17] transforms people that are powers into
[16:20] its a from powerless prayerless doubting
[16:23] and faltering witnesses of Christ to
[16:25] bold and effective service in his
[16:27] kingdom the power the power of the Holy
[16:29] Ghost is to transform you the Spirit of
[16:31] the Lord is changing us the 2nd
[16:34] Corinthians chapter 3 it says now the
[16:35] Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit
[16:38] of the Lord is there is Liberty but we
[16:40] all with open face beholding as in a
[16:42] glass the glory of the Lord are changed
[16:45] into the same image from glory from
[16:48] glory to glory even as by the Spirit of
[16:51] the law
[16:51] in other words you're looking into the
[16:53] mirror of God's Word and you see it a
[16:55] little bit like it's looking through a
[16:57] foggy glass but as you as you keep
[17:00] walking the Spirit of the Lord is
[17:02] changing you to match up that match you
[17:05] up with that image that you see in the
[17:07] word the Spirit is changing you by
[17:11] because the one that started that work
[17:13] is going to finish it if God starts this
[17:17] work in you he's going to see you all
[17:18] the way through he's not gonna leave his
[17:20] work halfway finished he's not gonna
[17:22] abandon you halfway through the
[17:24] Potteries working on you and he's gonna
[17:26] what he's gonna mold you into a finished
[17:28] work he started on you and he's going to
[17:30] see you all the way through it
[17:33] Romans chapter 8 verse 30 and 31 says
[17:36] moreover whom he did Preston ate them he
[17:39] also called and whom he called them he
[17:41] also justified and whom he justified
[17:43] them he also glorified what shall we
[17:45] then say to these things if God could be
[17:48] for us who can be against us you know
[17:51] what I believe that saying is that God
[17:53] is on your side if he's justified your
[17:56] soul by the new birth if he's filled you
[17:58] with His goodness he is going to see you
[18:00] through and do you realize the power and
[18:03] faith and believing and knowing that God
[18:05] is on your side God is with you as you
[18:08] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[18:10] death God is with you the cause you did
[18:12] not fear no evil God is with you he's
[18:14] walking it he's walking with you he's
[18:17] carrying you through all these troubles
[18:20] and when their eyes were open they knew
[18:23] when brother Bram said and I think that
[18:25] today we've had much preaching many fine
[18:28] ministers able ministers that has
[18:29] brought us the word your pastors and
[18:31] evangelists are so forth that comes
[18:33] through the city but I think the main
[18:35] thing that I'm trying to bring to you is
[18:36] the reality of the presence of Christ
[18:39] that you might see him and know that
[18:41] it's him by his identified promise for
[18:44] the day you know I believe that's what
[18:46] the message was set for that I believe
[18:48] that's what the preacher in the world is
[18:50] sent for the preaching of the gospel is
[18:52] said - I did - to you that God is here
[18:55] he's a present health he's not a god of
[18:58] history raising God out of history he's
[19:00] here with you
[19:01] working and changing and molding you if
[19:03] you'll let him because God is on your
[19:05] side God is still on the scene he's
[19:08] still real he's still saving and he's
[19:11] still healing and the Holy Ghost is
[19:13] still working tonight I want to witness
[19:16] what the Holy Ghost is doing the Holy
[19:20] Ghost is overcoming the things of this
[19:22] world so let's listen I just kind of
[19:24] kind of take a few moments to look at
[19:26] the lives of the disciples before and
[19:29] after they were transformed by the Holy
[19:30] Ghost following on the day of Pentecost
[19:32] and look at the change that was wrought
[19:34] on them you could identify your your own
[19:36] life with those Scripture by by looking
[19:38] at the things that happened to them and
[19:40] you can look back and say that happened
[19:42] to me too I believe tonight I believe
[19:44] that'll encourage you and strengthen you
[19:45] and Luke chapter 22 verses 31 to 33 this
[19:49] says and the Lord said Simon Simon
[19:51] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[19:54] that he may sift you as wheat but I have
[19:56] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[19:58] and when thou art converted strengthen
[20:01] thy brethren because you see before he
[20:04] was converted he was not evil able to be
[20:07] any kind of use to his brethren
[20:08] how could he strengthen him how could he
[20:10] give encouraging words
[20:11] how could he help anybody without that
[20:14] love of God than on the inside inside to
[20:17] love somebody even if they would smite
[20:18] him on the cheap to love somebody even
[20:20] if they're wrong to love people in the
[20:22] church even even when they don't treat
[20:23] you the way that you think that you
[20:24] should be treated but after the Holy
[20:26] Ghost fail let's read what happened to
[20:29] the disciples in in Acts chapter 2 verse
[20:31] 44 to 47 it said all that believed were
[20:34] together and had all things common what
[20:37] why did they have all things common
[20:38] because the word that they had had been
[20:40] quickened and now they didn't care for
[20:42] themselves more than others now they
[20:44] cared for the whole body of Christ that
[20:46] wanted good for one another they were
[20:48] all joined together in one Accord and I
[20:51] wouldn't declare to you tonight being in
[20:52] one Accord does not come by just trying
[20:54] to manufacture something but being in
[20:56] one Accord comes by the revealing of
[20:58] God's word as you eat the word you
[21:00] become the word and that will bring you
[21:02] more into one Accord there might be some
[21:04] like law that'll go away from Abraham
[21:06] but hey this little small group is going
[21:09] to get hold more
[21:10] more together until war like that little
[21:12] group in the upper room all in one
[21:14] Accord all believing the word of the
[21:16] hour all believing and waiting for the
[21:18] word for the spirit to come and quicken
[21:21] that word that we've held and sold their
[21:23] possessions and good and part a part of
[21:25] them to all men as every man had need
[21:27] and they continuing daily with one
[21:29] Accord in the temple and breaking bread
[21:32] from house to house did eat their meat
[21:34] with gladness and singleness of heart
[21:36] praising God and having favor with all
[21:38] the people and the Lord added to the
[21:40] church daily such as be saved
[21:42] I believe that tonight that same Holy
[21:45] Spirit can work that same kind of effect
[21:48] in the people of God I believe it is
[21:50] working that same kind of effect I
[21:51] believe that's why you see the Church of
[21:53] the Living God coming together and ours
[21:55] like this work what might be closing
[21:58] doors but yet there's something down on
[21:59] the inside of your ordinances I'm still
[22:01] gonna I'm still gonna gather together
[22:02] whether it's in my home whether it's a
[22:04] little small group in the church like we
[22:06] are here tonight because there's
[22:08] something in me that's desiring for the
[22:10] world to see God's word for feeling
[22:12] something inside of me that's
[22:14] pressurized that's push that I push it
[22:16] out in Matthew chapter 20 verse 21 he
[22:21] said he said unto her what wilt thou she
[22:24] say honey I'm grant that these my two
[22:26] sons and sons of Zebedee may sit the one
[22:28] on that right hand and the other on the
[22:30] left and thy kingdom and then also in
[22:34] Luke chapter 9 verse 46 to 48 then there
[22:37] arose of reasoning among them which of
[22:39] them should be the greatest and Jesus
[22:42] perceiving Jesus perceiving the thought
[22:48] of their heart took a child and set him
[22:50] by him and said unto them wheresoever
[22:52] shall receipt whosoever shall receive
[22:54] this child in my name receiveth me and
[22:56] whosoever shall receive me and receiveth
[23:00] him that sent me for he that is least
[23:01] among you all the same shall be great
[23:04] and you could see that before this
[23:06] change was rolled every one of them that
[23:08] wanted to be they were constantly
[23:09] bickering and fighting who among them
[23:11] would be the great and Jim then Jesus
[23:14] laid it down if you want to be great be
[23:16] the least something something changed
[23:18] after the new birth after the new birth
[23:20] they began to
[23:21] one another after the new birth they
[23:23] began to do for one another after the
[23:25] new birth they began to love one another
[23:26] in a way that could not be expressed
[23:28] before the Spirit of God fell him then
[23:30] at the day of Pentecost
[23:32] you see even in John chapter 18 verse 10
[23:34] and 11 it said they were
[23:36] Peter Peter did not know how to react to
[23:38] somebody that disagreed with him he
[23:40] pulled his sword out and he whacked the
[23:42] air off of malice the high priests
[23:44] servant but in Acts chapter 5 verse 41
[23:49] it says they departed from the presence
[23:51] of the council rejoicing that they were
[23:53] counted worthy to suffer shame for his
[23:56] name
[23:56] they went from trying to hack one
[23:58] another with a sword to rejoicing that
[24:00] they would that somebody would would
[24:02] rebuke him openly that somebody would
[24:04] would ridicule them and revile them and
[24:07] with them and beat them in the street
[24:09] the Holy Ghost is changing you the Holy
[24:12] Ghost will change you if you let him
[24:16] well you know what one example I believe
[24:20] in the in the Old Testament there kind
[24:22] of talks is a type of this kind of
[24:24] change is when Jacob he was ready to
[24:27] cross over to meet his brother Esau and
[24:29] that night he was scared to meet Esau
[24:32] because he there's a there's a before
[24:36] and afters to this story here before
[24:38] before he met the angel of the Lord he
[24:40] was afraid to go mean Esau and brother
[24:42] branham breaks it down and he says he
[24:44] says Jacob was afraid because to go talk
[24:46] to Esau because he knew of the way that
[24:49] he had treated him he all these things
[24:51] in other words all his past began to
[24:53] come up he was afraid because of all his
[24:55] sins were coming up before him he was
[24:58] afraid to go mean Esau I wondered
[25:00] tonight many listening in tonight if you
[25:02] might be afraid to meet he saw you might
[25:05] be afraid to go meet all the things that
[25:07] you've done in your past life the way
[25:08] that you've treated others your past
[25:10] sins or you're lying or your thievery or
[25:12] your back talking or your evil ways the
[25:14] way that you treated your mom and daddy
[25:16] or the way that you treated your
[25:18] children all these things afraid afraid
[25:20] to meet Esau but you know Jacob did
[25:23] something that I believe many maybe
[25:25] tended to take witness oven and learn
[25:28] from it and he got serious with God and
[25:31] he began to and not that night he met
[25:33] God came down and he wrestled with the
[25:36] angel of the Lord the Bible says he was
[25:39] yeah you know I believe I believe that
[25:42] wrestling with the angel of the Lord is
[25:44] when you you read something you read the
[25:46] promise of God in his word and you say
[25:49] that promise is for me and I'm not going
[25:52] to take no for an answer you know many
[25:55] times God will God will tell you know
[25:57] and and you need to just kind of accept
[26:00] that but when you read in the word and
[26:02] says you're healing us for you salvation
[26:05] is for you the promise of the Holy Ghost
[26:07] is for you and you think that you're
[26:09] being told no you just stay right there
[26:11] and you wrestle it out until you until
[26:13] you're walking different like by the way
[26:15] was preaching on until that that sign
[26:17] even the hip is touched so that you walk
[26:19] different so that the Holy Ghost the
[26:21] Holy Ghost changed your life and I
[26:23] believe I believe there's something that
[26:25] that same kind of change that was
[26:27] wrought in Jacob's life can be wrought
[26:29] in the believers life now what Jacob was
[26:31] not afraid to go meet Esau he rose up
[26:33] and with gladness went to meet he saw on
[26:36] the next day brother Branham said in US
[26:39] as I thought on my ways he said there
[26:40] might be meaning here tonight it's
[26:42] thinking about going home
[26:44] old age is catching up with you
[26:46] sicknesses got you in a grip better
[26:48] think on your ways before you get there
[26:50] in my in that timely and as Jacob on his
[26:53] way with his wife and his children here
[26:55] at a message coming that I saw he saw
[26:57] where the great army was coming to meet
[26:58] him and he began to think on his ways
[27:01] the way he had done Esau cheated him and
[27:03] it drove him to prayer all night long he
[27:05] arrested with the angel of the Lord went
[27:07] it let's go down to verse 40 when the
[27:10] angel of the Lord touched Jacob he
[27:12] walked different from then on he was a
[27:14] big fine runnin coward on one side but a
[27:17] limping limping prince on the other side
[27:19] of the brook you walk different and you
[27:21] think different he wasn't afraid to meet
[27:23] uh Esau then because he had wrestled
[27:25] with the angel think on your way he had
[27:28] wrestled it out with him saying you
[27:30] promised it
[27:30] I want my blessing and he stayed there
[27:33] until God blessed him and then he wasn't
[27:35] afraid anymore
[27:37] let's go to Luke chapter 9 verse pretty
[27:40] 141 here's another example of believers
[27:43] of the the disciples not knowing how to
[27:47] react
[27:47] to those that did not did not believe
[27:49] the message that that they were
[27:51] preaching and it came to pass when the
[27:53] time was come that he should be received
[27:55] up he steadfastly set his face to go to
[27:57] Jerusalem and sent messengers before his
[27:59] face and they went and entered into a
[28:01] village of the Samaritans to make ready
[28:03] for him and they did not receive him
[28:05] because his face was as though he would
[28:06] go to Jerusalem and when his disciples
[28:08] James and John saw this they said Lord
[28:11] wilt thou that we command fire to come
[28:13] down from heaven and consume them even
[28:15] as Elias did but he turned and rebuked
[28:18] them and said you know not matter of
[28:20] spirit you are if they could think I
[28:22] mean it made me look back in your own
[28:23] life or the lives of others that you've
[28:25] been acquitted with and how quick we are
[28:27] sometimes they want to rain down fire on
[28:30] people that don't believe the same way
[28:31] do we do for the Son of Man is but Jesus
[28:34] said for the Son of man has not come to
[28:36] destroy men's lives but to save him and
[28:38] they went to another village
[28:39] you know these are the the sons of
[28:42] Zebedee Jesus called them the sons of
[28:43] thunder because they were like this they
[28:45] were there already just boom just get
[28:47] right get right to it but you know one
[28:49] of these sons of thunder one of these
[28:51] sons of zebedee was John and went to the
[28:53] Isle of Patmos and you know his his life
[28:56] was changed by the Holy Spirit as he
[28:58] went through his journey until what by
[29:00] the time you know by the time he he got
[29:02] off the Isle of Patmos the story goes
[29:04] that he went to Pastor the church at
[29:06] Ephesus and they said Oh later on in his
[29:09] life they would bring him kind of carry
[29:11] him in and he would lay there on his cot
[29:13] or how in his chair or ivory was
[29:15] position and he would tell everybody
[29:16] little little children just love one
[29:18] another just just love one another
[29:20] because you see that man that had once
[29:23] desire to call down fire from heaven all
[29:25] the people that disagreed with him now
[29:27] the Holy Spirit had changed his life to
[29:30] where he loved that's that's the kind of
[29:32] change that the Holy Ghost will rock or
[29:34] will will will affect in your life the
[29:38] 1st John chapter 4 613 he says we are of
[29:41] God he that knoweth God heareth us he
[29:43] that is not of God heareth not us hereby
[29:46] know we the Spirit of Truth and the
[29:48] spirit of error listen he's telling you
[29:52] how to have discernment beloved let us
[29:54] love one another for love is of God and
[29:57] every one that loveth is born of God
[29:59] and knoweth god he that loveth not
[30:02] knoweth not God for god is love and this
[30:05] was manifested the love of God toward us
[30:08] because that God sent His only begotten
[30:10] Son into the world that we might live
[30:12] through him herein is love not that we
[30:15] loved God but that he loved us and had
[30:18] sent his son to be the propitiation for
[30:20] our sins beloved if God so loved us we
[30:23] ought also to love one another no man
[30:27] I've seen God at any time if we love one
[30:29] another god dwelleth in US and his love
[30:32] is perfected in us there's some other
[30:38] quote I got here about Esau and
[30:40] everything that's going to skip over
[30:41] there but listen because you see what
[30:44] the Holy Spirit did in the lives of
[30:46] those believers had conquered their
[30:48] natural the natural way of the flesh
[30:51] that when on the day of Pentecost when
[30:54] they were filled with the Holy Ghost it
[30:55] began to conquer them so that it took
[30:57] out all of that anger and enmity and all
[31:00] of that strife it took it out and
[31:02] changed them and transform them and I
[31:04] say these things that I to declare to
[31:06] you that God is transforming you now if
[31:09] you'll just be cognizant of what is
[31:10] going on in your life to realize that
[31:13] your ain't the same as you used to be to
[31:15] realize that God has taken you he's
[31:17] taking you through a journey and you're
[31:18] different than how you used to be
[31:25] brother Brown said in faith is our
[31:28] victory said faith is a conqueror faith
[31:30] is an overcomer it just isn't a
[31:32] peacemaker it overcomes faith is the
[31:35] victory that overcomes the world what
[31:37] does it do what is faith what is the
[31:39] Conqueror conquer and victory is the
[31:42] same to conquer it means to beat down to
[31:45] override to handcuff to throw into
[31:49] prisons it means that the sin that once
[31:52] ruled you you rule it now it means that
[31:56] you have overcome it you are you've
[31:58] whipped it you're greater than it is oh
[32:01] I feel religious right now which was
[32:04] first a sinner or savior a savior for a
[32:07] savior is more powerful than a sin
[32:11] that's how powerful the Holy Ghost is in
[32:13] the heart of a believer that's given
[32:15] over to it the Holy Ghost can conquer
[32:17] all that ails you they can conquer that
[32:20] temper it can conquer that bad attitude
[32:22] they can conquer that enmity at home
[32:24] with our husband or wife that our fuel
[32:26] at feuding and fighting with one another
[32:27] it can conquer a home where whether
[32:30] children are at enmity with the parents
[32:32] because the Holy Ghost is love and love
[32:35] is the thing that will cast out Devils
[32:37] you know brother Branham said you can
[32:38] cast out Devils more easily by giving
[32:40] your own waffle or roses and putting on
[32:43] an apron and washing the dishes and and
[32:44] all these in other words by showing love
[32:46] not not necessarily by laying on your
[32:48] hands and causing the great big
[32:50] commotion and casting out the devil like
[32:51] that love is the thing that will cast
[32:54] out the devil because love is the thing
[32:56] that will conquer all faith is the
[32:58] Conqueror faith and love is what God
[33:01] write what war effect in your life by
[33:04] the Holy Ghost and you see that spring
[33:11] spirit is guiding you to the word you
[33:14] see you see one of the effects of the
[33:16] Holy Ghost is it God it takes you it
[33:19] leads you to the word it's changing you
[33:21] it's changing your attitude and it's
[33:23] causing you to to desire the word more
[33:27] than the things of this world and that's
[33:29] one of the effects one of the examples
[33:31] in other disciples is before the Holy
[33:33] Ghost failed they could not bear the
[33:36] truth they could not bear that they
[33:38] could not receive all of the true they
[33:40] could not it was too much for them
[33:43] that's what Jesus said in John chapter
[33:45] 16 verse 12 he said I have yet many
[33:47] things to say unto you but you cannot
[33:50] bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit
[33:53] of Truth has come he will guide you into
[33:55] all truth for he shall not speak of
[33:58] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[34:00] that shall he speak and he will show you
[34:03] things to come he shall not speak of
[34:05] himself that's the way a lot of people
[34:07] want they want to just kind of go sit
[34:09] under a tree or sit in their home and
[34:11] not come to church and not read the
[34:13] Bible and just have the Holy Ghost tell
[34:14] lay it all out for him but he says he
[34:17] whatsoever he shall hear in other words
[34:19] whatever what
[34:20] word you bring it whatever word that
[34:22] when you're sitting in the congregation
[34:24] and you hear the word what he hears what
[34:26] the Holy Ghost hears when you bring it
[34:28] when you receive it that's what he's
[34:30] going to speak back to you because the
[34:32] Holy Ghost in you and speaking back the
[34:34] word that's speaking about the true
[34:36] interpretation of the word that you hear
[34:38] when you go to church when you press
[34:40] play at your home when you're riding in
[34:42] your car listening to the word he's
[34:43] speaking not of himself but he's
[34:45] speaking what he's hearing what the Holy
[34:48] Ghost in you is hearing receiving he
[34:50] speaks it back the correct
[34:51] interpretation and that's why when you
[34:53] get the Holy Ghost now you've got the
[34:55] true interpreter of the word of you
[34:57] where you can receive the word you can
[34:59] receive the deep teaching of the word
[35:01] and that's why John at first John
[35:03] chapter five he said he said we know he
[35:06] began to speak of the assurance of
[35:08] understanding by the new birth the
[35:10] things that we know now we have
[35:12] understanding he said we know that
[35:14] whosoever is born of God sinneth not but
[35:17] he that has begotten of God keepeth
[35:19] himself and that wicked one toucheth him
[35:21] not and we know that we are of God in
[35:24] the whole world lieth in wickedness and
[35:26] listen I wanted to clear to you tonight
[35:28] that if you are not this kind of a
[35:30] certain maybe it's time to do like Jacob
[35:33] but get to wrestling with the angel a
[35:34] little bit and find out where you stand
[35:36] because I believe especially in this
[35:38] hour we need to be at a place where we
[35:40] know that we are of God and he said and
[35:44] we know that the Son of God has come and
[35:46] has given us an understanding giving us
[35:49] what an understanding
[35:52] you understand the word because that one
[35:54] that gave the root the word is inside of
[35:57] you and he's speaking what he hears he's
[36:00] speaking the true interpretation of the
[36:02] word that we may know him that is true
[36:05] and we are in him that is true even in
[36:08] his son Jesus Christ this is a true God
[36:10] and eternal life what does the Holy
[36:13] Ghost do it calls you out of confusion
[36:15] it calls you out of Babylon it calls you
[36:18] you know Babylon goes back all the way
[36:20] to the Tower of Babel but
[36:21] Babel means confusion Babel became
[36:24] babble on and babble on became the Roman
[36:25] Catholic Church in the Roman Catholic
[36:27] Church had daughters and all it was was
[36:30] a bunch of confusion but we've been
[36:32] called out of confusion to a perfect
[36:34] understanding of who Jesus Christ is a
[36:36] perfect understanding of who he is in
[36:38] this hour we know I believe just the
[36:41] same as John knew because we've heard
[36:43] the same message that John was preaching
[36:46] back then the same troops that we've
[36:48] that he was preaching but ever and said
[36:50] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[36:52] come he was talking acquitting the
[36:55] scripture he will guide you into all
[36:56] truth he said the evidence would be that
[37:00] you would be in the truth you would be
[37:03] in the Word of God for your age evidence
[37:06] has to do with receiving that word that
[37:10] is the evidence the evidence of the new
[37:12] birth is that you can receive that word
[37:14] the evidence is that you agree with that
[37:16] word the evidence says that you
[37:17] understand the word you know the word
[37:20] you understand the word and you agree
[37:22] with the word why you do you know when
[37:27] you get the new birth with God because
[37:29] even before you get the new birth I was
[37:31] talking to Zack the other day about how
[37:33] when he was a 10 years old the Holy
[37:35] Spirit was moving in his life and but
[37:37] but even when you're young you you might
[37:39] resist a little bit but it's the Holy
[37:41] Spirit guiding you and moving you and
[37:44] taking you go over here step over into
[37:47] this little missionary Automation Church
[37:49] off to the side of the road going in
[37:50] this place listen to what these people
[37:52] have to say it's the Holy Spirit leading
[37:55] you and guiding you to all truth and
[37:57] when you get the baptism of the Holy
[37:58] Ghost he will continue to lead and guide
[38:00] you he's a god you got just as much of
[38:04] God as those Shepherds did when they
[38:05] when that angel appeared to him and said
[38:07] he's get the one that you're looking for
[38:09] has been born in Bethlehem go and yet
[38:11] they told him exactly down this the
[38:13] angel told the Shepherd's you're gonna
[38:15] find him in a manger go to Bethlehem go
[38:17] to the manger and this is where you're
[38:19] gonna find him and you know that you do
[38:21] know God leads you just like that
[38:23] you might not realize it but if you can
[38:25] look back in your life and find out you
[38:27] went from the over here to over there
[38:29] but God was holding you down keeping you
[38:32] in line with his
[38:33] guiding you and keeping you listen
[38:35] listen church tonight what what do we
[38:37] had to be afraid of because God is on
[38:40] our side God is with us he's moving us
[38:43] he's moving us to line up right with his
[38:45] word he's taking care of his word he's
[38:47] taking care of his people John chapter
[38:52] 14 and verse 25 it says jesus answered
[38:56] them I told you and you believe not the
[38:58] works that I do in my father's name they
[39:00] bear witness of you meld me but you
[39:03] believe not because you're not of my
[39:05] sheep as I said under you my sheep hear
[39:07] my voice and I know them and they follow
[39:09] me and I give unto them eternal life and
[39:12] they shall never perish neither shall
[39:14] any man pluck them out of my hand
[39:15] another word that voice is the thing
[39:18] that is leading you that voice the sheep
[39:21] will follow the voice do you know that
[39:24] Lazarus was one of his sheep and when
[39:26] Lazarus was down in the grave he heard
[39:28] that voice and the voice called him up
[39:30] from the grave and because he was one of
[39:33] the shepherd sheep he had to follow that
[39:35] voice that voice is so powerful to the
[39:38] sheep that you gotta you've got to
[39:39] follow it because the Shepherd is living
[39:42] only on the inside of you and he's he's
[39:44] causing you to follow you can't help but
[39:46] follow you the Holy Ghost is a God to
[39:49] bring back to your remembrance the
[39:51] things that have been spoken to to
[39:53] reveal these the Holy Ghost is it's a
[39:56] God to see what was in the heart of the
[39:58] Prophet to have an understanding of
[40:01] these mysterious things that he talked
[40:03] about the shout the voice in the Trump
[40:06] and the threefold mystery on the day of
[40:08] seventy weeks in the seven thunders and
[40:10] the seven seals and how it all ties in
[40:12] with a statute of a perfect man listen
[40:14] we've not heard just man's ideas but
[40:16] we've heard a voice that has brought us
[40:19] from captivity to Liberty to the great
[40:21] Liberty and love divine to understand
[40:24] the mind of Christ to see where he was
[40:26] placing things in the Bible that voice
[40:29] is the thing that guides you and
[40:31] eliminates confusion brother brems said
[40:36] in what was the Holy Ghost given for and
[40:37] that's a good message to listen to he
[40:40] said if you've got it and are guilty of
[40:42] these I wonder what's the leading you
[40:44] God will never lead you off the word
[40:46] he'll keep you with the word because
[40:48] that's God's own laws of his church for
[40:51] his people for women and for men what
[40:54] you say it don't harm me to do this or
[40:56] that it doesn't you see what he's saying
[41:00] there you say you've got the baptism and
[41:02] Holy Ghost and yet you're saying that
[41:04] you don't have to stay lined up with the
[41:06] word that you can get off the word the
[41:10] Holy Ghost in you will make you want to
[41:12] get lined up with a word it will make
[41:14] you want to get as far away from the
[41:15] world as you can just stay right lined
[41:18] up with it he said it doesn't the word
[41:20] says it does and if the Holy Spirit is
[41:22] in you it'll lead you right to the word
[41:25] there'll be no excuses God don't make
[41:28] alterations or excuses he makes the mark
[41:31] and you tell it my my oh I wonder how
[41:34] many of that would hit tonight think
[41:36] meditating on that he makes the marking
[41:38] you told but yet we want to make excuses
[41:40] so many times I wonder if the church
[41:42] doors were open how many would be hit or
[41:44] not if the situation was a little bit
[41:47] different because we make excuses for
[41:49] the excuses for not following the Word
[41:52] of God excuses for not doing what the
[41:54] word says excuses for not believing the
[41:57] word excuses for not for not I wonder if
[42:03] there's still a lot of the world and
[42:04] many of us where we want what's what's
[42:07] right for us more than the things of God
[42:09] where we want we where we want what our
[42:12] way more than God's Way but if God is
[42:16] leading you to the truth we'll lay down
[42:17] our own idea that our own thoughts and
[42:19] lay down everything and say do like
[42:21] Jacob did and say Lord I want your
[42:24] promises give it to me whatever it takes
[42:27] I'm willing to die right here in Matthew
[42:40] chapter 26 jesus saith unto them all ye
[42:43] shall be offended if because of me this
[42:45] night for it is written I will smite the
[42:48] Shepherd because it look another thing
[42:50] before the Holy Ghost before the Holy
[42:53] Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost the
[42:55] disciples had no constancy
[42:57] had no no no foundation to keep them
[43:02] steady in the faith no foundation to
[43:06] just to make them consistent all ye
[43:09] shall be offended to me this night for
[43:11] it is written I will smite the Shepherd
[43:13] and the Sheep of the flock shall be
[43:14] scattered abroad but after I'm risen
[43:16] again I will go before you into Galilee
[43:18] Peter answered and said unto him though
[43:20] all men shall be offended of thee yet
[43:22] will I never be offended he was so full
[43:25] of himself he thought that within my own
[43:28] makeup within my own lineage or whatever
[43:31] I if I just try hard enough then I can
[43:35] do it I can overcome jesus said in him
[43:37] verily I say unto thee that this night
[43:40] before the crow thou shalt deny me
[43:42] thrice Peter said unto them though I
[43:46] should die with thee yet will I not deny
[43:49] thee likewise also said all the
[43:52] disciples look don't matter how sincere
[43:55] you are before you get the Holy Ghost
[43:58] you are not pressurized to withstand the
[44:01] things of the world you have not been
[44:03] given been given power to overcome until
[44:06] the Holy Ghost it dwells you but after
[44:10] after the Holy Ghost comes that you know
[44:12] when an ego is pressurized to fly up
[44:16] into the heights and stare into the Sun
[44:18] why because he's built in that makeup
[44:20] the makeup of the ego is to fly high
[44:23] look straight into the Sun and go higher
[44:25] than all the other birds because God has
[44:28] put in him he has quipped that eagle
[44:30] that bird with the ability to do that
[44:32] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost equips
[44:34] the believer to fly high to be
[44:36] pressurized to withstand the atmospheric
[44:39] pressures to withstand the things of
[44:41] this world pressurize like a like a like
[44:44] a blue whale that can go way down into
[44:46] the deeps you can be pressurized to go
[44:49] down into the depths of God's Word
[44:51] pressurized to understand the deep
[44:53] hidden mysteries pressurized to
[44:55] withstand all the things that the devil
[44:57] can throw at you because there's
[44:59] something on the inside that's pushing
[45:01] out something out yeah yeah you know
[45:04] think of it like an astronaut an
[45:06] astronaut has that helmet on their head
[45:08] because
[45:09] there they've got that pressure on the
[45:10] inside of their suit to withstand that
[45:13] the lack of atmospheric pressure on the
[45:15] outside so that they can go up to the
[45:17] moon
[45:17] they can fly way high and brother Brown
[45:20] said now we're in the atmosphere age
[45:22] where you can see the natural in the
[45:25] natural they've gone from from the
[45:27] Wright brothers to the airplanes all up
[45:29] to the astronauts because in the
[45:31] spiritual we're flying high also we've
[45:33] we're ready to escape the gravitational
[45:36] pull the natural bonds and God has
[45:38] equipped us well he's given us the
[45:40] things that we need to take this plane
[45:43] he's pressurized in this hour he's given
[45:46] us something to pressurize again listen
[45:48] when when all the world begins to be in
[45:50] broke gross darkness and pressurized on
[45:54] the outside with sickness and frailties
[45:56] and misery there's something on the
[45:58] inside that's pressurized to push out
[46:00] against all that a pressure that that
[46:03] you know what you stand because you've
[46:05] got they understand her on the inside
[46:10] you see Peter Peter made his big boast
[46:13] but in John chapter 21 in 1819 something
[46:16] had been changed he said verily verily I
[46:19] say unto thee when thou wast young thou
[46:20] Gerdes thyself and walkest whither thou
[46:23] wouldest but when thou shalt be old
[46:25] Jesus talking to Peter thou shalt
[46:28] stretch forth our hands and another
[46:29] shall gird thee and carry thee whither
[46:32] thou wouldest not this spake he
[46:34] signifying by what death he should
[46:36] glorify God another or the man that once
[46:39] boasted that he wouldn't he would not
[46:41] deny Jesus and then denied in three
[46:44] times before the crow this man had
[46:46] been transformed into a man that said
[46:48] I'm not worthy to die in the same manner
[46:51] that my Christ died let me be crucified
[46:52] upside down this man had been
[46:54] transformed into something that was
[46:56] willing he was he was willing and able
[46:59] to be a witness of the things that God
[47:01] had done for him in his life brother
[47:07] Graham said in down knowest all things
[47:08] all things he said it's in me eternal
[47:11] life now we are the sons of God now not
[47:15] we will be we are now that's what the
[47:18] trouble of it is people you beget the
[47:19] you people that's born again he said
[47:23] you let the devil kick you around like a
[47:26] football he said stand on your ground
[47:29] you're in Christ he said let the devil
[47:33] kick you around that's the trouble of it
[47:35] today another Christian person that's
[47:37] sitting here sick if they only knew that
[47:39] they were sons and daughters of God now
[47:42] living with Christ not you will be now
[47:46] you are the sons of God now you've got
[47:49] that the day of Pentecost fully come
[47:51] nineteen hundred years ago now is the
[47:54] hour now is the time now is the accepted
[47:58] hour this is the acceptable year of the
[48:02] Lord
[48:03] now is when healing is supposed to be
[48:05] now is when the hip miracles take place
[48:08] now is when Christ is revealing himself
[48:11] here we are now not in the future the
[48:15] devil keeps pushing it off that's
[48:16] Catholicism now is the day this is the
[48:19] hour this is the time this is the place
[48:22] right now this is the day you know I
[48:25] believe he was doing the same thing that
[48:27] I'm trying to do tonight is to reveal to
[48:30] you to expose that God is still working
[48:33] in his church that he's effecting a
[48:36] change in you even now as you listen to
[48:39] the word being preached he's doing
[48:41] something in our midst even though it
[48:43] might not look like it but yet something
[48:45] is being wrought and his home is honing
[48:47] down time and now is the time he says as
[48:50] he's saying now is the time for healing
[48:52] now is the time when God is revealing
[48:54] himself in this bride now is the time
[48:57] don't look to the future like the
[48:58] Catholics do don't keep pushing it off
[49:00] but now is the time now is the hour
[49:03] because look what does the was another
[49:06] thing that the Holy Spirit does the Holy
[49:08] Spirit makes you agree with the word
[49:12] before before the Holy Ghost fell on the
[49:15] day of Pentecost they could not
[49:16] understand the will of the Father they
[49:18] could not agree with the word because
[49:20] they didn't know what they were agreeing
[49:21] with they didn't they had no they had
[49:23] they had nothing within them to say this
[49:25] is that in Matthew chapter 16 verse 27
[49:28] 21 it said from that time forth began
[49:31] Jesus just show unto his disciples how
[49:33] that he must go into Jerusalem
[49:36] and suffer many things of the elders and
[49:38] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[49:40] and be raised again the third day then
[49:42] Peter took him and began to rebuke him
[49:44] saying be it far from me from the Lord
[49:46] this this shall not be not be under thee
[49:49] but he turned and said unto Peter get
[49:52] thee behind me Satan
[49:53] thou are an offence unto me for thou
[49:56] savourest not the things that be of God
[49:58] but those that be of men in other words
[50:02] he had no understanding of the
[50:04] requirement of that was what it took to
[50:07] fulfill the Word of God and that day now
[50:10] now apply that in this day I believe now
[50:13] that God has given to us by the
[50:15] preaching of the message an
[50:16] understanding of what it takes to
[50:18] fulfill the word of God in this day and
[50:21] that day Jesus had to die on a cross but
[50:24] in this day there's a bride this that's
[50:26] predestinated to fulfill the New
[50:28] Testament by receiving the word that
[50:30] she's heard the word that was preached
[50:32] by Jesus as he preached for three and a
[50:34] half years now that full preach the full
[50:36] unveiling of that word has been received
[50:38] by a bride and that is your that is your
[50:41] part in fulfilling the word in Acts
[50:46] chapter 2 verse 30 37 and 38 we know
[50:48] Peter Peter then was given an
[50:50] understanding of what it what what it
[50:52] would take to fulfill the word and he
[50:53] said repent and be baptized every one of
[50:56] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[50:57] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[50:59] the gift of the Holy Ghost because the
[51:01] scripture became open to him his
[51:03] understanding began it was open and he
[51:06] it was revealed to him who Jesus Christ
[51:08] was and and identified what had happened
[51:11] with this with this Old Testament
[51:12] Scriptures that this is that and and and
[51:15] and and then even even was able to
[51:17] explain that this is a promise that that
[51:19] is given and who the promise was given
[51:21] to because he had understanding in
[51:24] Matthew chapter 26 verse 21 to 25 it
[51:27] says and as they did eat he said verily
[51:30] I say unto you that one of you shall
[51:32] betray you betray me because listen
[51:34] before the new birth before the new
[51:36] birth was given on the day of Pentecost
[51:38] they had no spiritual discernment' and
[51:41] let's not let's see how John explains
[51:42] spiritual discernment and in 1st John in
[51:45] a second
[51:45] he said as Judas was sitting there he
[51:47] said they were exceedingly sorrowful
[51:49] and began every one of them to say unto
[51:51] Him Lord is it I and he answered and
[51:53] said he that dip of his hand with me in
[51:55] the dish the same shall betray me and
[51:57] they began to look around and everybody
[52:00] was wondering who is it even though he
[52:02] plainly told him it did you just even
[52:05] asked him but he says it me and he said
[52:08] pretty much yes and yet they they looked
[52:11] around without any kind of a spiritual
[52:13] understanding
[52:14] imagine all the the deception that Judas
[52:16] had portrayed as he walked with him and
[52:18] and the things that he had done but yet
[52:21] their eyes were veiled to what was going
[52:22] on in their myths but John and at first
[52:25] John chapter 4 he says hereby know ye
[52:27] the Spirit of God every spirit that
[52:30] confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in
[52:33] the flesh is of God notice how he
[52:36] explains discernment now we know brother
[52:38] Brandon had prophetic 'old that that
[52:40] kind of gift of discernment where he was
[52:41] able to see the spirit and a person but
[52:44] I believe that there is a certain type
[52:46] of discernment that every every
[52:47] born-again Christian has by discerning
[52:50] with the word in other words you listen
[52:52] to what comes comes out of somebody's
[52:54] mouth and you know what's in their heart
[52:57] because out of the heart from out of the
[52:59] heart of the mouth speaketh you know
[53:01] what's going on about whether somebody
[53:03] resists the word whether someone when
[53:06] you preach the word whether they say
[53:07] well I don't believe that I that can't
[53:09] be true you know the state and the
[53:11] position of that person here by know you
[53:14] the Spirit of God every spirit that
[53:16] confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in
[53:19] the flesh is of God he said it is come
[53:22] in the flesh in other words the
[53:24] testimony is that God has come into the
[53:27] flesh of his people that he's caught he
[53:29] is come right now in this building
[53:32] sitting here in your homes right now
[53:34] listening in he has come in your flesh
[53:37] right now if you hear somebody say he is
[53:40] God know that he identifying with
[53:42] Colossians 1:26 27 this mystery that was
[53:45] hidden from ages the ages but now is
[53:47] revealed to the Gentiles the mystery
[53:49] that Christ in you Christ is in you the
[53:52] hope of glory God is tabernacling
[53:54] himself in you and you know that when
[53:56] somebody does not confess that there's
[53:59] something wrong
[54:00] and that is how you know the two spirits
[54:02] he said in every spirit that confesseth
[54:05] not that Jesus Christ has come in the
[54:07] flesh is not of God and this is that
[54:10] spirit of Antichrist whereof you have
[54:12] heard that it should come and even now
[54:13] already is it in the world
[54:16] in other words that spirit of Antichrist
[54:18] confesses that there are no witnesses
[54:20] that nobody has the right to witness the
[54:24] Word of God that nobody has received the
[54:27] Word of God for their self that the Holy
[54:29] Ghost is tabernacling in themselves they
[54:31] do away with the witness of the word
[54:33] they do away with the preaching of the
[54:36] gospel because the preaching of the
[54:38] gospel is a witness that the Word of God
[54:40] is true they said witness the preaching
[54:43] of the God is the manifestation of the
[54:45] Word of God this is that spirit of
[54:50] Antichrist whereof you have heard that
[54:52] it should come and even now already is
[54:54] it in the world you are of God little
[54:55] children and have overcome them because
[54:58] greater is He that is in you than he
[55:00] that is in the world they are of the
[55:02] world therefore speak they of the world
[55:04] and the world heareth him we are of God
[55:07] and listen how he explains this we are
[55:10] of God he that knoweth God heareth us he
[55:14] that is not of God heareth not us hereby
[55:19] know we the Spirit of Truth and the
[55:21] spirit of error think about coming to a
[55:23] play a position of understanding where
[55:26] you know the word and you know your
[55:28] maker so well that you know that if
[55:30] somebody does not agree with the words
[55:33] that you speak something is wrong with
[55:35] them I believe that the bride is coming
[55:37] to that the bride is the final voice
[55:39] under her messenger not a verb or
[55:42] without her messenger but under her
[55:44] messenger then she will be able to speak
[55:46] the words that the messenger has said
[55:48] and if you do not agree with the words
[55:50] that the messenger has said there's
[55:52] something wrong you see you see agreeing
[55:57] with the word is the identification of
[56:00] the Holy Spirit that that story that
[56:02] there brother Wade was preaching on
[56:03] about how Sarah Sarah I before the type
[56:06] of the báb stirred all of us in the Old
[56:08] Testament Sarah I mean
[56:09] contentious and whenever the word goes
[56:11] forth you'll see people begin to rise up
[56:14] in contention maybe not maybe not openly
[56:16] but in their homes they'll begin to
[56:17] speak out against the ministry they'll
[56:19] begin to speak about how turbidity guy
[56:21] gets the things that are preached or
[56:23] maybe not even missive many times lately
[56:27] they're even speaking out without
[56:29] realizing speaking out against the
[56:32] things that the prophets spoke that they
[56:34] proclaim to believe when you when you
[56:37] objector
[56:38] when you disagree with the word when you
[56:40] are contentious just like Sarai that
[56:43] shows that there's something wrong down
[56:45] on the inside of your heart something
[56:47] something is wrong because the base
[56:49] shows that there's something that is not
[56:51] believing down on the inside
[56:52] that's why Sarai said she said well I
[56:55] don't know if I can go along with you
[56:57] having a child let me let me find
[56:59] another way to do it yeah and that's
[57:02] what contention does it finds another
[57:04] who tries to find another way an
[57:06] alternative to fulfilling the Word of
[57:08] God maybe maybe I can just maybe I can
[57:12] just get the word for myself maybe I can
[57:14] just figure it out on my own I don't
[57:16] need let the Ethiopian eunuch because
[57:18] somebody to kind of help me along the
[57:19] way maybe maybe a contention is
[57:22] disagreeing with the word in 2nd Timothy
[57:27] chapter 3 verse 5 date Paul's talking
[57:31] about all having a form of godliness but
[57:34] denying the power thereof from search
[57:36] turn away he's laying out that spirit
[57:39] that Antichrist spirit that that went
[57:41] down from Balaam and Janus and Jambres
[57:43] and and and Jezebel and all the
[57:45] different types that we know of he said
[57:47] for of this sort of a which creep in the
[57:50] houses creeping creeping the house sneak
[57:53] in and lead people away where what you'd
[57:56] find out a wife is leaving her husband
[57:58] so she can follow after something that
[57:59] she's been led away so all these things
[58:02] that are going on I almost can't speak
[58:06] openly but that's alright
[58:08] they words creep in their houses and
[58:10] lead captive captive silly women lady
[58:14] with with sins led away with diverse
[58:17] lusts ever learning and never able to
[58:20] come to the knowledge of the truth now
[58:25] as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses so
[58:28] do these also resisted the truth men of
[58:33] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[58:36] truth resisting the truth not agreeing
[58:40] with the word not agreeing with the word
[58:42] no matter how simple and I'm not I don't
[58:45] let's don't get it confused too but with
[58:47] things that happen as you grew up the
[58:48] statue for perfect man things that you
[58:50] don't understand but when you openly say
[58:52] that that that cannot be truth I don't
[58:55] believe that it's true that I have to
[58:57] dress that particular way or I have to
[58:59] walk that particular way or I I can't
[59:01] smoke this particular thing or I can't
[59:03] drink this thing when you begin to
[59:05] disagree with the world and say I
[59:08] disagree with the with the law and the
[59:10] prophets and all these things that have
[59:12] been laid out in the message of the hour
[59:13] that shows that there's something wrong
[59:17] brother Brown said whether we're
[59:20] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or
[59:22] Pentecostals or what more Bale to die
[59:24] he's talking about the doctrine of
[59:26] balaam the doctor of Balaam was all
[59:27] we're all the same that there's no
[59:29] different he said ye are a separated
[59:32] people holy under the Lord
[59:34] dedicated to the word in the Spirit of
[59:35] God to bear fruit and his promise of
[59:38] this day and you're not of them I know
[59:40] that's awful strong but that's the truth
[59:42] just the same dedicated to a servant in
[59:45] this last day you think about the
[59:47] doctrine of Balaam was to say that we're
[59:49] just all the same that there's no
[59:52] difference that we don't have to
[59:53] separate but God told you that you are
[59:56] special people you were a separated
[59:58] people he's we're not making something
[1:00:00] special of ourselves he's the one that
[1:00:03] said you're especially he's the one that
[1:00:04] said I'll never leave you or forsake you
[1:00:06] he's the one that made all these
[1:00:08] promises and told you not to forget his
[1:00:10] the benefits in the faith of Abraham
[1:00:17] let's go down to paragraph 21 he said
[1:00:19] then you can understand because the Holy
[1:00:21] Spirit
[1:00:21] within you every time the Bible said
[1:00:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:26] and forever
[1:00:27] a good intellectual person wants to be
[1:00:29] popular will say no Jesus Christ is a
[1:00:32] great healer Gogi into all the world
[1:00:34] these signs shall follow them that
[1:00:35] believe the unbeliever shakes his head
[1:00:38] but if the Holy Spirit is in you he will
[1:00:40] say amen amen
[1:00:43] it'll agree with the word every time the
[1:00:46] spirit and word has to agree and then
[1:00:49] that's the reason the children of
[1:00:50] Abraham believe those things because
[1:00:52] they are God's Word and it's God in them
[1:00:55] vindicating his own word amen now if you
[1:00:58] can receive that that's not skim milk
[1:01:01] that'll help you put vitamins spiritual
[1:01:04] vitamins in you in other words if the
[1:01:07] Holy Ghost is eating you that's the
[1:01:09] thing that is making you putting you in
[1:01:11] the input and putting in you that desire
[1:01:13] to come to church to listen to the word
[1:01:16] to open up your Bible and it's that
[1:01:18] thing that is causing you to agree with
[1:01:20] the word because without the new birth
[1:01:23] you cannot agree with the word but with
[1:01:25] the new birth you have to agree with the
[1:01:27] word it will agree with the word that is
[1:01:30] the evidence of the new birth as you
[1:01:32] were agreeing with the word when the
[1:01:34] word is priest you say that's got to be
[1:01:36] the truth and it keeps unfolding and
[1:01:38] unfolding and you know that it's true
[1:01:40] because that thing in you is agreeing
[1:01:42] with you he said in the perfect strength
[1:01:46] by perfect weakness because faith will
[1:01:49] always agree with the word then if your
[1:01:51] faith is contrary to the word if you
[1:01:53] think it is then you haven't got faith
[1:01:55] and the faith can only be built upon the
[1:01:58] Word of God
[1:01:59] correct faith and then the Great
[1:02:02] Commission he said we are so
[1:02:04] intellectual everything has moved away
[1:02:06] from the Spirit it's the word it's word
[1:02:09] it's word but sure I believe in the word
[1:02:11] but if the spirit don't agree with the
[1:02:14] word in other word if you don't have a
[1:02:16] revelation a an understanding of what
[1:02:19] the word is then you got something mixed
[1:02:22] up somewhere look at when Cain he was
[1:02:25] just as religious and just as much with
[1:02:27] the word as Abel was it was a revelation
[1:02:29] that made the difference
[1:02:30] they both worship they both brought
[1:02:33] sacrifices that
[1:02:34] both built an altar that both belong to
[1:02:36] church they both were sincere they both
[1:02:39] worship so if God altar respects
[1:02:41] sincerity and fundamentalism why didn't
[1:02:44] he respect Cain but through revelation
[1:02:46] Abel being just by revelation no
[1:02:49] scriptures in them days God had revealed
[1:02:51] it to him that it wasn't fruit apples
[1:02:54] and oranges taking us out of the Garden
[1:02:55] of Eden it was blood the life do you do
[1:02:59] you agree tonight I want to read this
[1:03:01] recent quote some scriptures real quick
[1:03:03] you don't have to scroll through them
[1:03:05] I'm just going to go through quick some
[1:03:07] of these promises of God in this Bible
[1:03:09] then I believe it now in this hour the
[1:03:11] real believer will agree with and the
[1:03:13] Bible says the sick of salmon when
[1:03:15] citizen the afflicted people that we'll
[1:03:17] save for the hour my lamp of God and the
[1:03:19] Lord will lighten my darkness for by the
[1:03:22] I have run through a troop by my god
[1:03:25] have I leaped over a wall and brother
[1:03:27] Browne said the troop of death will have
[1:03:30] no holders to it to this bride she'll
[1:03:32] run right through it leap over the wall
[1:03:35] between natural and supernatural and go
[1:03:38] into the arms of God and I believe these
[1:03:41] kind of scriptures are the things that
[1:03:43] now we are able by the baptism at all he
[1:03:46] goes quickening the word that we've
[1:03:47] heard to agree with we can look at these
[1:03:49] promises and the Bible and say I agree
[1:03:51] with this brother Graham said even death
[1:03:56] will come and say he's coming up your
[1:03:57] sleeve and you'll say giveaway Jordan
[1:03:59] I'm crossing over Psalms chapter 46
[1:04:02] verse 1 to 5 it says God is our refuge
[1:04:04] and strength a very present help in
[1:04:07] trouble therefore will not we fear
[1:04:09] though the earth be removed and though
[1:04:10] the mountains be carried into the midst
[1:04:12] of the sea though the waters thereof
[1:04:14] roar and be troubled though the
[1:04:16] mountains shake with the swelling
[1:04:17] thereof there is a river the streams
[1:04:19] they're aware of shall make glad the
[1:04:21] City of God the holy place of the
[1:04:24] Tabernacles of the Most High God is in
[1:04:27] the midst of her she shall not be moved
[1:04:29] God shall help her and that ride early
[1:04:32] Psalm chapter 34 said the eyes of the
[1:04:35] Lord are upon the righteous and his ears
[1:04:37] are upon their cry the face of the Lord
[1:04:40] is against them that do evil to cut off
[1:04:42] the remembers of them from the earth the
[1:04:44] righteous cry and the Lord heareth and
[1:04:46] deliver
[1:04:47] out of all their troubles the Lord is
[1:04:49] not unto them that are of a broken heart
[1:04:51] and save earth such as be of a contrite
[1:04:53] spirit many are the afflictions of the
[1:04:55] righteous but the Lord delivereth him
[1:04:58] out of them all in other words I believe
[1:05:00] that these scriptures are all saying the
[1:05:02] same thing that the Holy Ghost is with
[1:05:04] you he's on your side he's changing you
[1:05:07] don't be afraid because God there he's
[1:05:10] with you many are the afflictions of the
[1:05:13] righteous listen if I get sick I know
[1:05:15] somebody that can heal me if I die I
[1:05:18] know somebody that will get me out of
[1:05:19] the ground I know somebody that could
[1:05:21] redeem that's redeemed me I know
[1:05:22] somebody that's paid the price I know
[1:05:25] the antidote they're all that I've been
[1:05:27] inoculated with the Holy Spirit
[1:05:28] inoculation the Holy Spirit vaccination
[1:05:31] to take us to protect us brother Branham
[1:05:35] said and he swore by himself he said
[1:05:36] then if you were Abraham's seed you
[1:05:38] can't dispute with God Abraham's seed as
[1:05:41] a part of this spirit for God gave
[1:05:43] Abraham a sign of circumcision cutting
[1:05:46] off the flesh for a witness he had
[1:05:47] received him in this last days has took
[1:05:50] the Holy Ghost and circumcised to every
[1:05:52] believer of cutting off all doubts and
[1:05:54] unbelief to believe God's Word is pure
[1:05:57] and holy and it's the truth circumcision
[1:06:01] cutting all away all unbelief everything
[1:06:04] cutting loose every shoreline saying God
[1:06:06] I believe you live or die sinker or
[1:06:09] drown it's your word I believe it and I
[1:06:13] believe that is the evidence of the
[1:06:15] believer in this day that says I they
[1:06:18] because the believer has been changed to
[1:06:21] a person now they can take a hold of
[1:06:23] God's Word and say I believe it come
[1:06:24] with me I agree with it I agree
[1:06:29] just like Mary did I agree for the
[1:06:32] impossible because God's Word promise
[1:06:34] that God would do the impossible do you
[1:06:37] know that brother Branham said that we
[1:06:39] are called in this hour to believe for
[1:06:41] the impossible when you see that God's
[1:06:43] Word says that he is going to do the
[1:06:45] impossible and you agree with it watch
[1:06:47] signs and wonders follow you because
[1:06:50] you're agreeing with what God has
[1:06:52] already said in your believers that the
[1:06:53] disciples when they saw Jesus cursed
[1:06:55] that fig tree it looked like something
[1:06:57] that impossible and then the Bible says
[1:06:59] that they marvel
[1:07:00] but then that same promise is supposed
[1:07:03] to be fearful filled in this hour you
[1:07:05] were able to speak the word you know it
[1:07:08] looks impossible it looked impossible
[1:07:10] when Hattie writes children she said I
[1:07:13] want the salvation of my children it
[1:07:15] looked impossible but it was it came out
[1:07:17] of her mouth and it came to pass you
[1:07:20] know it looked impossible when that
[1:07:22] angel came to Mary and said you're gonna
[1:07:23] a virgin shall conceive and that promise
[1:07:26] is going to be fulfilled in you you are
[1:07:29] gonna be fulfilled the fulfillment of
[1:07:31] that promise and she said be it unto me
[1:07:34] according to that word and she believed
[1:07:36] what looked like it was it was
[1:07:38] impossible she she believed to be
[1:07:41] impossible because Jesus said well that
[1:07:49] angel said to Mary he said for with God
[1:07:52] nothing shall be impossible and brother
[1:07:55] Branham said in the unchangeable Word of
[1:07:57] God he said that word was good enough
[1:07:59] for her she said Behold the handmaid of
[1:08:02] the Lord be it unto me according to thy
[1:08:04] word and she started to rejoice over it
[1:08:06] not wait see she had to believe the
[1:08:09] impossible she had to believe something
[1:08:12] that never happened that's what we have
[1:08:14] to do we have to believe the Impossibles
[1:08:17] to see new life how can we believe the
[1:08:20] impossible except we be equipped with
[1:08:23] the Holy Ghost to give us power to agree
[1:08:26] with the word to give us power to see
[1:08:28] the change that God has wrought in our
[1:08:30] life to know that God is present and on
[1:08:33] the scene now and now those of you at
[1:08:36] home just kick back and relax in your
[1:08:38] recliner a little bit I'm just gonna go
[1:08:40] a few a little bit more I know we now
[1:08:42] see you have the Liberty to just take
[1:08:44] your rest and pull that comfort up
[1:08:46] around your knees and maybe get you a
[1:08:49] little sip of water or whatever I had
[1:08:52] just be blessed because I'm saying these
[1:08:56] things to encourage you to bring to your
[1:08:58] remembrance that God is with you that
[1:09:00] God is on the scene that he's with you
[1:09:02] in this hour of need he hasn't left you
[1:09:05] yeah maybe it looks like impossible how
[1:09:09] in the world has
[1:09:10] cygnus falls across the land it looks
[1:09:12] like an impossible situation as more and
[1:09:15] more people are getting sick but listen
[1:09:17] God is I believe he's holding us down to
[1:09:19] where we can believe for the impossible
[1:09:21] what looks like the impossible to call
[1:09:24] the Dead sinks from the ground to call
[1:09:26] the to call the dead from that we're
[1:09:28] going to see the dead what looks like
[1:09:29] something impossible moving among us
[1:09:31] we're going to see our bodies changed
[1:09:34] something that looks impossible because
[1:09:36] God is God is a God of miracles he's a
[1:09:39] miracle working God he's a sign working
[1:09:41] God he's a wonder working God
[1:09:44] you know the disciples when they when
[1:09:46] they began to when they saw Jesus begin
[1:09:49] to break bread and fed the 5000 fed all
[1:09:53] the multitude that was a thing that
[1:09:55] looked impossible but you know it
[1:09:57] identified him with the one that fed the
[1:10:01] children of Israel as they journeyed
[1:10:02] through the wilderness and the disciples
[1:10:05] looked on that and I said ah I know that
[1:10:07] that is the same one that's got to be
[1:10:10] Jehovah Jireh that provided that lamb
[1:10:13] for Abraham as he was about to slaughter
[1:10:15] Isaac as he was about to sacrifice Isaac
[1:10:17] I know that that is the same one that's
[1:10:20] got to be the same one that provided
[1:10:22] water for the children of Israel in the
[1:10:24] wilderness that's got to be the same one
[1:10:26] and I believe we can look into the word
[1:10:28] a night and say I know that that same
[1:10:30] one that provided manna in the
[1:10:31] wilderness and provided those loaves and
[1:10:34] fishes for the people gathered around I
[1:10:36] know that that same one is still on the
[1:10:38] scene to provide from for me healing in
[1:10:41] the time of trouble salvation for my
[1:10:44] family whatever it is because why
[1:10:46] because I agree with the word I agree
[1:10:49] with his promise I'm trying to find a
[1:10:56] place to stop here now brother Graham
[1:11:01] said and believing God he said you've
[1:11:02] got a soul beside your census God never
[1:11:05] give you those senses to trust him where
[1:11:07] the God give you a spirit to trust your
[1:11:11] senses only to contact see taste feel
[1:11:13] smell in here but to you yourself as
[1:11:16] that spirit that lives in you and when
[1:11:18] that's been cept when that's been
[1:11:20] regenerated and the old man died
[1:11:24] and the new man born again that is a
[1:11:27] part of God then you become a son of God
[1:11:31] an offspring of the creator then you can
[1:11:34] believe that impossible things because
[1:11:36] you're made up of the miracle-working
[1:11:39] God you're a part of him brother
[1:11:42] understanding the message influence he
[1:11:44] said it's the holy God in that church
[1:11:46] not the holy man but the holy spirit
[1:11:49] working in that man do you know what
[1:11:51] that means that means that it's that
[1:11:53] hold that's the Holy Spirit that is
[1:11:55] agreeing with the word that's the Holy
[1:11:58] Spirit that is accomplishing and
[1:11:59] fulfilling his word and that takes all
[1:12:02] the burden off of you because all you
[1:12:04] have to do is just believe it and watch
[1:12:06] God performing you know I love I say
[1:12:09] that maybe to relieve you from the
[1:12:10] burden this is maybe I know many people
[1:12:12] have been burdened with what what if I
[1:12:14] get sick everybody's gonna look at me
[1:12:16] and say well that person doesn't have
[1:12:18] faith listen well this is not an hour of
[1:12:20] judgment now is the hour of faith and
[1:12:23] you are not the one that has to fulfill
[1:12:25] the word of God all you have to do is
[1:12:28] believe it he's the one that made the
[1:12:30] promise if you remember that good that
[1:12:31] that that sermon and what brother
[1:12:33] Brennan was preaching and and then God
[1:12:36] just took over brother branham's body
[1:12:38] and began to speak out through him and
[1:12:40] he said he said brother Brennan has
[1:12:42] nothing to do with this it's me I'm the
[1:12:44] Lord and he said I'm the one that made
[1:12:46] the promise he's the one that made the
[1:12:49] promise he's the one that is going to
[1:12:52] fulfill it oh you are obligated to do is
[1:12:55] believe it see that takes the burden of
[1:12:59] proof off of you just put it put it back
[1:13:02] in God's lap all you got to do is just
[1:13:04] lay I believe that's what Jacob did when
[1:13:06] he was when he was wrestling with the
[1:13:08] angel he just took God's promises and
[1:13:10] laid it in front of him and said you
[1:13:12] promised it now bring it to pass but to
[1:13:15] pass I believe that God wants us to see
[1:13:17] us to see us do that but you got to know
[1:13:20] what he promised get into the word and
[1:13:22] find out what he what he said what what
[1:13:25] he promised for you and this age and
[1:13:27] then I believe that you will see you
[1:13:29] will see God fulfilling miracles and
[1:13:32] what now
[1:13:33] now is the day for miracles I know we
[1:13:37] don't we don't put much much stock as
[1:13:39] far as a proof and signs and wonders but
[1:13:42] listen where there is faith signs and
[1:13:45] wonders will follow Sunday's signs and
[1:13:48] wonders cannot help but follow because
[1:13:49] the Creator is living on the inside and
[1:13:52] he is the one that were produced he will
[1:13:55] he's the one that were produced the word
[1:13:57] he's the one that will fulfill it you
[1:14:03] know I I believe that God has been
[1:14:07] preparedness for such a time as this and
[1:14:09] preparation comes in and strange form as
[1:14:12] many times a preparation when you're
[1:14:15] when you're ready getting ready for a
[1:14:16] battle in the military they then make
[1:14:18] you crawl through muddy ditches and they
[1:14:20] make you crawl under barbed wire and do
[1:14:22] things that are unpleasant it'll rub
[1:14:24] shoulders with one another I'm getting
[1:14:25] into the church now rub shoulders with
[1:14:27] people maybe they disagree with you and
[1:14:29] and and we're hard with one another and
[1:14:31] things like that but but yet that comes
[1:14:34] when we come to a place like like Noah
[1:14:36] did there was a preparation time there
[1:14:39] was a time where he was building up and
[1:14:41] then he got locked inside of the ark and
[1:14:44] the door was shut and he was in there
[1:14:46] Rahab there was a preparation time where
[1:14:48] she was listening and then she she hung
[1:14:50] the Scarlet core out her window and then
[1:14:53] she was stuck inside that room
[1:14:55] preparation time was over all she had to
[1:14:57] do was wait and just have faith and
[1:15:00] watch God do wonders God would perform a
[1:15:03] miracle and all you talk about something
[1:15:05] impossible with all the city of Jericho
[1:15:08] fell down around her in their little
[1:15:10] house protected by that scarlet cord
[1:15:13] showing that inside that house was a
[1:15:15] believin house all around her fell down
[1:15:18] but she was safe inside of that Noah was
[1:15:21] safe inside inside of there
[1:15:24] listen there there comes there comes a
[1:15:27] time where all that preparation comes to
[1:15:31] a head and then you see the fruit of
[1:15:34] your labor listen we've been preparing
[1:15:37] all this time and I believe I believe
[1:15:40] now the preparation time oh yeah yeah
[1:15:42] and I'm saying all this because I don't
[1:15:44] mean I'm gonna go ahead and say it
[1:15:46] out on the internet many people are
[1:15:48] saying we've been preparing because we
[1:15:49] we have just stayed home and not going
[1:15:52] to church anywhere and that's been
[1:15:54] preparing us for staying at home and not
[1:15:56] going to church anywhere I wonder what
[1:15:59] kind of thing you are prepared for if
[1:16:00] you don't agree with the word if you
[1:16:03] don't or if your life is not matching up
[1:16:05] with what the word says should we should
[1:16:07] be doing are you truly prepared and I
[1:16:09] don't say these things to to shake you
[1:16:12] or anything but maybe that's the time
[1:16:14] now that that you should be checking up
[1:16:16] the day and the hour is now that you
[1:16:18] should be checking up where where you're
[1:16:20] standing
[1:16:22] preparation time is where you're
[1:16:24] stocking up your storehouse your
[1:16:26] personal store out you're packing
[1:16:28] yourself in with the word you're maybe
[1:16:30] jostling with the stranger in the camp
[1:16:32] and people that disagree with you you're
[1:16:34] coming to a revelation of what this
[1:16:36] message is to you something that's
[1:16:39] happening in you to change and because
[1:16:41] of that then you are prepared to do like
[1:16:44] Noah and be locked away then you were
[1:16:47] prepared to do like Ruth and to do like
[1:16:49] like Esther and Abraham to be to be set
[1:16:52] aside and then you've come to the
[1:16:54] preparation time now you're prepared
[1:16:58] brother what are you the word because
[1:17:03] the Word of God the Word of God in us
[1:17:05] agrees with the word and that is our joy
[1:17:08] that's what the Word of God has brought
[1:17:10] us to because the Bible says in John
[1:17:12] chapter 15 if you abide in me and my
[1:17:14] words abide and you you shall ask what
[1:17:17] you will and they shall be done unto you
[1:17:18] and that is our comfort that we have the
[1:17:21] word that we understand the word that we
[1:17:23] know the word and his word is abiding in
[1:17:26] us the musicians can go ahead and come
[1:17:28] forward listen to the Spirit of God the
[1:17:31] spirit of God is a affecting change the
[1:17:34] Spirit of God is with us now the Spirit
[1:17:37] of God will call seed to come up it will
[1:17:40] cause a reaction and God is still on the
[1:17:44] scene he's still real heals he's still
[1:17:46] saving he's still healing he's still a
[1:17:49] provider and the Holy Ghost is still
[1:17:52] working in the hearts and lives of
[1:17:53] believers he's still here don't be
[1:17:56] downhearted and downtrodden
[1:17:59] know that God is still on the scene he's
[1:18:01] still alive and his people I hope that
[1:18:04] you're encouraged tonight at home
[1:18:05] listening in all the ones around the
[1:18:07] world maybe people overseas or wherever
[1:18:09] you might be
[1:18:10] and that you're encouraged tonight to
[1:18:12] know to know that God but you know
[1:18:15] thinking about Noah and all the ones
[1:18:18] that that they have prepared
[1:18:19] God is God is bringing us to a place
[1:18:21] where we know for ourselves and we can
[1:18:24] stand on our own two feet maybe one day
[1:18:27] you'll come to a place where you don't
[1:18:29] have your pastor with you
[1:18:30] or you don't have anybody the ministers
[1:18:32] the deacons you don't have anybody close
[1:18:35] at hand to come and lay hands on you but
[1:18:37] what you'll have is the revelation of
[1:18:39] God's Word to keep you 3 and that will
[1:18:42] keep you and I believe that's what we've
[1:18:44] been preparing for packing it in so we
