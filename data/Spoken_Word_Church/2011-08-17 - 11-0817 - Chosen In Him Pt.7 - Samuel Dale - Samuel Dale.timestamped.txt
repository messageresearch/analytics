[6:48] home good to see you amen you like

[6:55] and we will read tonight from
[6:58] isaiah 55
[7:01] ephesians 1
[7:03] in isaiah 55.
[7:09] let's pray before we read our scripture
[7:12] father we thank you for your love and
[7:14] your grace we thank you for everything
[7:16] that you've given us
[7:17] we know that you have truly given
[7:20] them unto us freely
[7:22] we didn't have to do anything to get
[7:24] them
[7:24] but we all we have to do is just receive
[7:26] it nor do we just ask you to help us
[7:28] tonight as we try to speak about you and
[7:31] open our understanding of our scriptures
[7:33] that we may walk in the light of your
[7:35] love and understanding and forgive our
[7:37] sins
[7:38] and lead us father by thy love and thy
[7:40] grace
[7:41] and keep us lord as we endeavor now to
[7:45] speak about you you come on the scene
[7:47] and speak to our hearts and as we were
[7:50] talking about sunday then
[7:52] truly lord
[7:53] come and
[7:55] open the understanding of our of us as
[7:58] thy people but speak to our hearts
[8:01] and quicken yourself unto us
[8:03] because that's what happened there at
[8:04] pentecost
[8:06] they're
[8:07] you you open their understanding but
[8:09] then you quicken them
[8:11] to seeing what was alive we love you and
[8:13] we thank you and just have your way now
[8:15] and keep us in jesus name
[8:18] amen ephesians 1
[8:20] verse 3 and 4.
[8:22] you have it on the screen if you want to
[8:24] follow it they should be the god and
[8:26] father of our lord jesus christ who have
[8:28] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[8:31] and heavenly places that we're at
[8:33] in christ
[8:35] there's nothing worth anything except in
[8:37] christ jesus right
[8:38] according as he has chosen us in him
[8:42] before the foundation of the world
[8:45] that we should be holy and without blame
[8:46] before him in love
[8:49] now remember
[8:50] we've been trying to bring a point of
[8:52] how that we were chosen in him
[8:55] so then tonight we're going to be
[8:56] dealing with like the thoughts of god
[8:59] and and the things you know of trying to
[9:02] express it to you
[9:04] and
[9:05] so let's just go to isaiah
[9:07] because i like what he has to say about
[9:09] it isaiah 55
[9:11] i start reading it verse 7.
[9:15] let the wicked forsake his way
[9:17] and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[9:21] him return unto the lord and he will
[9:24] have mercy upon him
[9:26] and to our god for he will abundantly
[9:29] pardon now the original there says that
[9:31] he will multiply
[9:33] to pardon right because that's what it's
[9:35] going to take place that's where he
[9:36] dealt on the dead pentecost he
[9:37] multiplied all right
[9:40] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[9:42] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[9:45] lord
[9:45] for as the heavens are higher than the
[9:48] earth so are my ways higher than your
[9:50] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[9:53] for is the rain cometh down into snow
[9:55] from heaven and return is not hither
[9:58] but waters the earth and make it that
[10:00] bring forth but
[10:02] bring forth in bud
[10:04] that it may give seed to the sower
[10:06] and bread
[10:08] to the eater
[10:09] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[10:12] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[10:16] void but it shall accomplish that which
[10:18] i please
[10:20] it shall prosper in the thing whereunto
[10:23] i sent it you may be seated the lord had
[10:26] his blessing to the reading of the word
[10:30] i told you that we're going to be using
[10:32] the screen to to read off of
[10:35] but i wanted to give you these quotes
[10:37] sometimes
[10:38] um you know to where that
[10:41] you would be able to take them home with
[10:42] you we won't be doing this continually
[10:44] we're just doing it throughout this kind
[10:46] of a series that we're in
[10:49] because
[10:50] we want to make sure you understand that
[10:52] it's what the prophet of god says and
[10:54] that's what we believe we believe god
[10:56] sent us a prophet to bring the word unto
[10:58] us in the last days and we're not here
[11:00] at just a reading room to read off what
[11:03] he says
[11:04] but we want you to see what he did say
[11:07] in the way he said it to work that it
[11:09] would give us
[11:11] an understanding but now isaiah see he
[11:14] said
[11:16] i said we're talking about being chosen
[11:18] in him
[11:19] all right
[11:20] now
[11:22] we we get in our mind a lot of times
[11:25] what we think something says and as we
[11:28] do
[11:29] then
[11:30] it's really not what is being said
[11:33] all right
[11:34] and uh
[11:35] most of our thoughts on chosen
[11:39] you know they're in in paul saying to
[11:41] the ephesians
[11:42] chosen us in him
[11:45] we kind of make that as being chosen by
[11:47] him
[11:49] or of him
[11:51] and that's not the correct scripture
[11:53] the scripture says to be chosen
[11:55] in him
[11:56] all right see then that way we've got to
[11:59] find out as i've been trying to express
[12:02] to you
[12:03] we're chosen in him
[12:05] all right who's the hymn
[12:08] christ because he just said up above
[12:10] there in the verse of above you know
[12:12] that it's all in christ
[12:15] all right so we know who
[12:17] it you know the part that's that's
[12:19] happening is in christ
[12:21] and then the one who chooses is
[12:25] almighty god all right
[12:27] now
[12:28] we don't believe in trinitarian the
[12:30] trinitarian doctrine
[12:32] uh you know and we do not believe in god
[12:35] in three persons blessed trinity we
[12:36] believe in one true and living god
[12:39] and believing it that way then
[12:41] it was not two people that are doing
[12:44] this
[12:45] because as i tried to bring out unto you
[12:47] that
[12:48] the choice was not like somebody
[12:51] choosing
[12:52] you know i'll take this but it won't
[12:54] take that
[12:56] because that would make a respecter of
[12:58] persons out of someone
[13:00] but it's the fact that god chose to do
[13:03] it this way
[13:05] he chose to reveal himself
[13:07] he chose to to come down and and make
[13:10] himself known
[13:11] and that's what i love about god is the
[13:13] way he can unfold itself uh unto us that
[13:16] like we we talk about it you know and
[13:19] the prophet has said it that you know
[13:21] science they can't no way to make a
[13:22] blade of grass
[13:24] but yet you can take a blade of grass
[13:25] and look at it and see almighty god
[13:28] because you can see that something had
[13:29] to be the creator
[13:32] then you're coming down from that then
[13:33] you can follow it in
[13:35] and understand
[13:36] but that's what we've been trying to see
[13:39] that
[13:40] we were chosen in him
[13:42] so when he was chosen now we'll get to
[13:44] it on another message or two when we get
[13:47] on it we'll get on to work that your
[13:49] name was written in revelations 18 uh 13
[13:52] 8 that your name was written in the
[13:54] lounge book of life before the
[13:56] foundation of the world
[13:57] and you know and we'll get down to
[14:00] seeing
[14:01] that these things are taking place back
[14:03] there
[14:04] we're still remember in our studies we
[14:07] we've been about four services or five
[14:10] covering that all we're talking about is
[14:13] what's up in heaven we haven't got down
[14:15] to earth yet
[14:17] so we're trying to study what took place
[14:19] in heaven
[14:20] and then seeing that god stalks
[14:24] now
[14:24] god's thoughts are eternal
[14:28] now we have to credit him to be in that
[14:30] way
[14:31] he can't have a new thought
[14:33] if he has a new thoughts he then he he
[14:35] wouldn't be god he would be like you and
[14:37] i
[14:38] so he doesn't have doug don't make me
[14:40] new way whatever he says that's it
[14:44] when he said a lamb would be slain you
[14:46] know back there before the finally that
[14:48] had to take place
[14:50] right the lord jesus christ had to fool
[14:53] that fulfill that and die on
[14:55] on a cross to pay the price for me and
[14:58] you
[14:59] that had to take place why because god
[15:01] said it
[15:02] and that's the point that i've been
[15:04] trying to make to you and i
[15:05] that if we would just believe it if you
[15:08] find what god says in the bible then
[15:10] just stand on it and say it's mine
[15:14] if it be healing
[15:15] if it be salvation if it be anything
[15:18] that you have need of
[15:20] you know
[15:21] in a real true line then you can look at
[15:24] it and just say the bible says it
[15:27] and i believe it
[15:29] because god can't tell you one thing and
[15:31] then tell you something else
[15:34] there's just no way it can't be done
[15:36] because he'd be changing his mind now
[15:39] we've been through and you know in the
[15:41] stories there it looks like in the bible
[15:42] that he changed his mind but no he
[15:43] didn't change his mind when he gave that
[15:45] man 15 years back there the man died 15
[15:48] years later he just extended his life
[15:51] for 15 years
[15:52] the same prophet that one told in making
[15:54] his house in order he was going to die
[15:56] was the same prophet that went back and
[15:58] told him that's right that i've extended
[16:00] your life for 15 years he didn't change
[16:02] his mind
[16:03] god doesn't change his mind what he says
[16:05] is it amen
[16:08] all right so then that way we can
[16:09] believe in it and be able to stand on it
[16:13] and believe it so then we realized that
[16:15] we were chosen in him paul says
[16:18] were
[16:19] he said before the foundation of the
[16:21] world
[16:22] all right now
[16:24] how can we bring it down to where that
[16:26] god
[16:27] can choose
[16:29] you know
[16:30] and doing his choosing
[16:33] how can we bring it to the basis of
[16:35] understanding to keep it from crossing
[16:37] up
[16:39] maybe in our thoughts and our minds our
[16:41] scriptures and things that you know that
[16:43] we we look at because it does look like
[16:45] that he just really chose
[16:48] somebody
[16:49] well he did
[16:53] if we weren't chosen by him back there
[16:56] then
[16:56] we'll never be chosen
[16:58] because that's why jesus said see he
[17:00] said i chose you the scripture we used
[17:02] last week he said i chose you before the
[17:04] foundation
[17:06] look at jeremiah go back and read
[17:08] jeremiah where he said you know i saw
[17:10] thee and ordained be a prophet before
[17:12] the founder for the world
[17:14] see
[17:14] all right god can do these things but he
[17:17] has to do it in a way that he won't be a
[17:20] respecter of persons
[17:22] all right so in doing that then he has
[17:24] to give everybody a choice
[17:29] because he can't override your free
[17:31] moral agency
[17:33] he won't make you be saved if you don't
[17:35] want to be
[17:36] all right man because that would be
[17:38] overriding your free moral agency see so
[17:40] he lays it down in front of us
[17:43] that's why the bible says no man sought
[17:45] god at any time
[17:47] because it was god seeking us
[17:49] but that doesn't do away with the fact
[17:51] that we were crying praying fasting uh
[17:55] quitting doing things and trying to line
[17:57] up and and all of that that was the
[17:59] human element
[18:00] trying to to come under subjection
[18:03] to god
[18:05] because we don't believe that he just
[18:06] come down and just dumped everything on
[18:08] us no
[18:10] we had to make the choice
[18:12] but sure then he knew the choice
[18:15] or if he wasn't you know if he didn't
[18:17] know the choice we would make then he's
[18:19] not almighty god
[18:20] that's just to solve the problem so then
[18:23] we we know that he he could look down
[18:26] through time and see everyone that would
[18:28] accept him
[18:29] right and then he could go ahead and
[18:31] write her names in the book
[18:34] but he could leave out names because he
[18:36] knew they would not accept it
[18:39] see then you don't blame god
[18:41] because that's what paul said can the
[18:42] thing formed
[18:44] say why did you form me this way see we
[18:47] god didn't form us wrong
[18:49] he formed us right
[18:50] gave us a choice adam and eve took the
[18:53] wrong choice
[18:54] right and when the choice was made now
[18:57] we don't blame them
[19:00] because we're free moral agents
[19:02] see if we blame them we could put it all
[19:04] on them and god couldn't condemn us
[19:07] but that can't be true see because we're
[19:10] free mortal agents just exactly like
[19:12] adam and eve was
[19:13] we have a choice to whether we want to
[19:15] accept jesus christ as our savior or not
[19:17] i mean
[19:18] and god will come down and i like the
[19:21] way the prophet would bring it out that
[19:22] even the people who have never heard of
[19:25] the gospel will be given an opportunity
[19:27] one day because
[19:29] god won't condemn them because they
[19:31] haven't heard
[19:33] he might take away some rewards from you
[19:35] and i
[19:36] that's pocketed our money instead of
[19:38] putting it out to be able to send the
[19:40] gospel to the world
[19:41] he could do that part
[19:43] but he won't be you know he can go ahead
[19:45] and give those people
[19:47] eternal life one day
[19:49] not because of being good but it's got
[19:51] to be something on the basis of work
[19:53] that like the scripture said jesus comes
[19:55] in a cup of water in my name will be
[19:57] forgotten in this world or the world to
[19:59] come
[20:00] it's doing a good deed for somebody
[20:02] could it hurt your eternal life
[20:04] but we don't go around saying now what
[20:06] can i do yeah
[20:08] you know now we don't go around saying
[20:10] what can i do that i might inherit
[20:12] because that's the rich young ruler
[20:14] what good thing can i do
[20:16] jesus said this he said i've done that
[20:20] he said okay say what you got come on
[20:21] follow me
[20:23] that put him in a place where he didn't
[20:25] want to follow it all right but look
[20:26] what i'm saying
[20:29] we have to make the choice
[20:32] here on earth but god knew that choice
[20:35] before the world
[20:37] so before the world he chose christ
[20:41] right amen not choosing as we say about
[20:45] uh uh it wasn't that god chose to send a
[20:48] son if we used to teach in the
[20:49] organization you know things we thought
[20:52] that god would would send his son
[20:54] well now would you do that
[20:57] i mean consider the thought would you
[20:59] send your son
[21:00] you know somebody's out there and they
[21:02] shot now one of you two is gonna die
[21:04] well go on boy
[21:08] you say now that's being silly because
[21:09] that wouldn't what happened jesus i know
[21:12] the story i come through all of it
[21:14] i heard all of the the discourses and
[21:17] the things about it back there that they
[21:19] say well jesus chose to do it
[21:22] it was who was jesus that's right if he
[21:24] wasn't almighty god then who was he
[21:26] right all right that's right all right
[21:28] so then before the world he never chose
[21:32] to send a son he chose to come himself
[21:35] that's right so he moved over in another
[21:37] form
[21:38] if we talk about it another
[21:39] manifestation of god
[21:41] in the form called a son
[21:43] and then he could create the world and
[21:45] and be those things and all of the
[21:47] things that would take place and it's
[21:49] not another god it's the same god
[21:52] all right see then that god being there
[21:57] then he would be able to
[22:01] see
[22:02] you and i
[22:04] in the correct order before the
[22:05] foundation of the world
[22:07] that's what i've been trying to get you
[22:08] to see see if we were chosen in him
[22:11] well i know when he was chosen we were
[22:13] chosen
[22:14] all right we get back to the story now
[22:17] it wasn't that he chose
[22:20] it was he chose to do it
[22:23] it wasn't he was chose to come you know
[22:26] well okay son you go on down you go down
[22:29] there and die no
[22:30] no he chose to come himself
[22:33] that's why i'm trying to get the point
[22:34] to you about isaiah he said my thoughts
[22:37] are not your thoughts
[22:39] so about the time we think we get the
[22:40] bible figured out as being what we
[22:42] believe it is you come to find it out it
[22:44] doesn't work that way too a lot of times
[22:47] you find out your thoughts on the word
[22:49] of god is not worth anything
[22:52] see there's a scripture there um
[22:56] he says his thoughts are deep
[22:59] well that's true
[23:00] god's thoughts are deep
[23:02] it's not to be able to worry that we can
[23:04] think it out but his thoughts is part of
[23:06] him that's what i've been trying to get
[23:07] you to look at
[23:11] now god is like not like me and you now
[23:13] so let's get it out of the way
[23:17] his thoughts are eternal
[23:19] and he can never have another thought
[23:21] that's right
[23:22] all right see i could have a new thought
[23:23] stand right here say something haven't
[23:25] you thought say something else backwards
[23:27] and forth and change all the time in my
[23:29] thinking but he can't
[23:31] because if he did he wouldn't be gone
[23:34] so you'd be dealing with him as a a
[23:36] human vessel
[23:37] and that's not true but his thoughts are
[23:40] eternal and part of him
[23:42] because whether you like it or not your
[23:45] thoughts are part of you
[23:48] now brother dale i had some bad thoughts
[23:50] today
[23:51] well you know why i had the bad thoughts
[23:53] i let them come
[23:54] right there
[23:56] come on you agree with me
[23:58] i let them come
[24:00] that's right
[24:01] you say well well no i can't help you
[24:03] having bad thoughts well
[24:05] you can let them come in and entertain
[24:07] the thought
[24:08] you might not be able to keep it from
[24:10] coming but you don't have to let it
[24:11] build a nest in your head you know what
[24:13] the old saying goes
[24:15] you know
[24:16] right but that's what we do we let it
[24:18] build a bird dance up into our brain and
[24:19] then it becomes part of us but here
[24:21] regardless your thoughts are what you
[24:24] are
[24:26] you know different what your thoughts
[24:28] are
[24:29] even though your thoughts are not
[24:30] eternal
[24:32] see if you think you're ugly you know
[24:34] what
[24:40] but if you think see
[24:42] a lot of people you know they they're so
[24:44] skinny and all because they've got in
[24:46] their mind that they're fat
[24:49] and they look like a well rope with
[24:50] orange sticking on it you know already
[24:52] skinny as can be
[24:54] but yet they think see they've got it in
[24:56] their mind that their
[24:58] their see is it they're they don't want
[25:01] to get fat they don't want to if they
[25:02] eat much so they'll go eat but then
[25:04] they'll stick their finger down their
[25:05] truck and go throw it up and get rid of
[25:08] it
[25:09] and finally kill them
[25:11] why because you're not getting no
[25:13] nourishment to keep you alive
[25:15] see
[25:15] but that's the way your thoughts are
[25:17] still you know what that person's
[25:18] thought that's what that person's
[25:19] thoughts are
[25:22] if you want to go home lay down goof off
[25:25] be lazy as all get out
[25:28] not work for a living depend on the
[25:30] government you know what
[25:33] you do
[25:36] you can do it
[25:38] because that's your thoughts
[25:40] but you know a millionaire that's one
[25:42] that you know if you inherit your money
[25:44] that's one thing
[25:45] but a lot of millionaires are people who
[25:47] have earned their money
[25:48] you know that's the type of person that
[25:50] is not a lazy person that's the type of
[25:53] person who has thoughts about what to do
[25:56] and all of his thoughts he's bringing it
[25:58] into manifestation
[26:00] right right
[26:02] we see if we could look at it like that
[26:03] then we could see that god multiplied
[26:06] that ten thousand times ten thousands
[26:09] about his thoughts and see his thoughts
[26:11] are eternal
[26:13] amen
[26:14] see a millionaire could think of a
[26:16] little while he said oh i goofed up
[26:17] because if you know the story let's see
[26:19] who i don't know the name but the guy
[26:20] that was uh ripley's ripley's believe it
[26:24] or not
[26:25] he actually went broke
[26:28] he was sitting at the desk
[26:30] the story says and he wrote across the
[26:32] desk
[26:33] broke
[26:34] believe it or not
[26:43] his thoughts went to work
[26:45] probably died a multi-millionaire i
[26:47] guess he did but now because they're way
[26:48] back when they he started
[26:51] see
[26:52] we can change
[26:54] life
[26:56] right
[26:57] we can change things around us
[27:00] by changing our thoughts
[27:02] that's right
[27:03] changing the way that we think about
[27:05] things the way that we we do
[27:08] we can change them
[27:10] you know
[27:12] and see as a christian why wouldn't we
[27:14] want to have good thoughts
[27:16] why would we want to have any kind of
[27:18] bad thoughts what would be the the
[27:20] situation the word that we would would
[27:22] even consider
[27:23] to to you know to think about
[27:26] uh some form of having a wrong thought
[27:29] i mean i repent i know that that i can't
[27:32] help the devil coming and bringing the
[27:34] thought you know what
[27:35] i try to move that thought away as quick
[27:37] as possible but then i say lord why did
[27:40] i let my mind go idle
[27:44] the old saying is what
[27:46] i don't mind it's the devil's workshop
[27:48] that's right man
[27:50] because that's our thinking
[27:51] all right
[27:53] but you see if we cut it off
[27:55] and we put something else in the place
[27:57] of it
[27:59] but it starts going wrong just start
[28:01] saying jesus jesus jesus
[28:05] sweetest name i know
[28:10] you know god don't care how good you are
[28:12] singing
[28:14] he don't care what you got in tune
[28:17] he don't care nothing about you because
[28:19] his thoughts is a whole lot different
[28:20] than ours
[28:21] so what does he do
[28:23] he just moves in closer
[28:27] all right now you have to take the
[28:28] prophet's word for what he says about it
[28:29] but i i know york too but he says the
[28:32] devil sees god moving towards you
[28:35] and he said he'll do everything he can
[28:37] to cut that off that's right yeah sure
[28:39] amen
[28:41] he said you let me be around the house
[28:42] and people coming in to be prayed for he
[28:45] said the kids start acting up
[28:49] everything starts going wrong
[28:51] he said quick as everybody leaves he
[28:53] said kisses just settle down
[28:56] you know he's talking about his kids
[28:57] having little devils in them
[29:02] because that's that's what i try to get
[29:03] you to see
[29:04] you know you look down at that little
[29:05] baby and you saw a wonderful little
[29:06] sweet baby nice born and since
[29:08] everything in the neck would come in the
[29:09] world speaking lies it will lie no
[29:11] matter how good mom and daddy is it will
[29:13] lie you say my kids don't lie that you
[29:15] are a liar
[29:18] you are the liar
[29:20] you're the one that needs help
[29:23] because they're born that way
[29:25] sitting there with a cookie all over his
[29:26] hand and all over his face and said you
[29:28] eat that cookie
[29:31] right come on
[29:33] because they're born into this domain
[29:37] and their thoughts begins to be
[29:39] motivated by this world and the way that
[29:42] we are
[29:43] and the day that we're living in thine
[29:45] sea
[29:46] you know and the way these kids are
[29:48] today you just think about it well my
[29:50] lord when i was
[29:51] about as bad as old boy to worked with
[29:53] he said he went to school for 12 years
[29:56] so he finally finished the sixth grade
[29:58] and quit
[30:00] we were i was pretty close to that but
[30:03] you know how it works but
[30:05] you know but look how smart the kids are
[30:07] today
[30:09] see their thoughts have increased
[30:12] and that's what i love to do with kids i
[30:14] like to see them
[30:15] think about things
[30:17] because i know god thinks about me
[30:20] i've got one in here somewhere trying to
[30:22] find it while i go running through all
[30:23] my notes but i'll find it and bring it
[30:25] back to you
[30:26] but you see
[30:29] god set our thinking
[30:33] you know
[30:36] god before the world
[30:38] sit there thinking
[30:41] he said now brother dale you're just
[30:42] making him too human
[30:45] why not
[30:46] he made us
[30:49] why can't you comprehend that god could
[30:51] sit down and think things over that's
[30:53] right but just remember what i said once
[30:55] he thought it opened i said he couldn't
[30:56] sell he couldn't say well that's a bad
[30:58] way of doing it i'll change my mind do
[30:59] it so much no no because he's not
[31:01] dealing like me and you
[31:02] his thoughts are not like our thoughts
[31:05] he can never have a new thought he can't
[31:06] do that he has to whatever he says
[31:08] that's it right
[31:11] all right see then
[31:13] if he says we were chosen in him
[31:16] well i want to say what he says
[31:19] see then we get down to looking at that
[31:21] and seeing that we wasn't back there as
[31:24] people
[31:25] no we don't believe in that that's right
[31:28] we don't believe in in those doctrines
[31:29] like that like the mormons they believe
[31:31] we were back to ours literal identities
[31:33] or forms or whatever right and you know
[31:35] and finally came down to earth to be uh
[31:38] where we are i don't believe that
[31:40] right amen
[31:42] because i believe what the the bible as
[31:44] far as the basis of where it can go back
[31:47] to it can go back to the word god
[31:51] we see the word god means an object of
[31:53] worship
[31:55] all right so there wasn't anything to
[31:57] worship him
[31:58] until he created the angels
[32:01] that he was god
[32:03] all right and as he created them then
[32:07] those angels worship and make him
[32:09] manifest that point
[32:11] of god
[32:13] but see then the scholars can go back
[32:15] because you read in your bible if you've
[32:16] got anything like a scofield you go back
[32:18] there and read and it'll say elohim
[32:23] you'll use different titles and elohim
[32:25] means self-existing
[32:29] so if we're not going to believe in
[32:31] trinitarian doctrine we sure don't want
[32:33] to believe in philosophy or whatever you
[32:34] want to make it to where you make the
[32:36] bride as being back there as people with
[32:38] him no huh
[32:42] he was back there and he saw us
[32:45] he thought of this world
[32:47] he thought of life and what it would be
[32:51] but then as he thought about it he knew
[32:53] exactly what we would do he didn't make
[32:55] adam and eve sin in the guard right no
[32:58] because he would have been the author of
[32:59] sin
[33:00] right but he put him on a choice
[33:03] a free moral agency
[33:05] and when they got onto the choice of
[33:07] free moral agencies they said want to go
[33:09] then they would be able to make the
[33:11] wrong choice or the wrong thought
[33:16] now don't you think he's got the wrong
[33:18] thought transmitted to her
[33:20] see satan transmitted his thought into
[33:23] her mind as to
[33:26] what you know in other words he said to
[33:28] her go back and read your bible you were
[33:30] brought into this world for that purpose
[33:34] you just read it and transfer it over
[33:35] into your human mind and think about
[33:37] eve was told you were brought into the
[33:39] world for this purpose to reproduce
[33:44] that's what she was trying to do
[33:46] she was trying to do god's
[33:49] bring god's thought into manifestation
[33:51] but the problem was she got her thought
[33:53] involved
[33:56] when she got her thought involved it
[33:58] messed it up
[33:59] had she stayed with adam
[34:02] right
[34:04] but adam the bible said adam didn't sin
[34:07] right
[34:08] he said he was in the transgression he
[34:10] said well adam done the same thing yes
[34:12] he did but he done it willfully
[34:15] he walked out of there willfully with he
[34:16] to try to redeem her and couldn't bring
[34:18] her back because he found himself lost
[34:22] but you see eve had that thought
[34:24] transmitted satan transmitted it into
[34:26] her mind
[34:30] and as he transmitted his thought into
[34:32] her mind then she went forth and and
[34:35] produced the act or the problem whatever
[34:37] you want to call it you know
[34:39] we believe we know what it is but
[34:42] still
[34:43] it was first a thought
[34:54] i want you to see
[34:55] i'm not spanish and i want you to see
[34:58] okay
[34:59] so i say see every once in a while all
[35:01] right i've got a couple other words that
[35:03] i say all right brother gary he can't
[35:06] imitate that because he can't say see
[35:08] he won't try to imitate me he'll do all
[35:10] of you
[35:11] i guess he might be afraid to
[35:13] but listen
[35:16] if god's thoughts are eternal
[35:19] what caused the fall
[35:24] in the garden
[35:26] was satan's followed
[35:29] placed into eve's thinking
[35:32] right
[35:33] right
[35:36] and that caused the fall to come
[35:39] cause us all to be born in sin shape and
[35:41] iniquity and spouse my mother's wounded
[35:43] liar
[35:45] because it was the wrong thought
[35:49] now what if she'd waited on god
[35:53] what if she didn't really just stay with
[35:55] adam because the adam never had a wrong
[35:57] thought
[36:00] he was a son of god he never had a wrong
[36:02] thought
[36:03] but she had the wrong thought
[36:06] and when she had that thought it was
[36:08] finally transmitted
[36:11] into the basis of what we call sin
[36:14] right
[36:16] and see that's the way our thoughts are
[36:21] our thoughts can be great
[36:24] if they're in line
[36:27] i have no problem with the senses of the
[36:29] body do you see they still smell in here
[36:32] as long as god's leading me i have no
[36:34] trouble with the senses of the spirit
[36:36] which is raising memory conscious
[36:37] affections and all like that and desires
[36:39] and as long as god is leading me
[36:44] i like what a man told me at work one
[36:45] time
[36:46] and you know and i'm a human being so
[36:48] don't get the wrong point what i'm
[36:49] saying but
[36:50] where a lady did she she said something
[36:52] to me about them and i said well you
[36:54] know i'm like you or anybody else she
[36:55] said i've been around you all my life
[36:57] all i mean for five years i've worked
[36:58] with she said i've never seen you have a
[37:00] bad day
[37:04] there's always never a wrong thought in
[37:05] your mind
[37:08] it's not plenty of them
[37:10] but as i try to live what i am
[37:14] whether it be at work or whether i'm
[37:15] playing or what i'm hunting or fishing
[37:17] or whatever
[37:18] i want to be
[37:20] you know i want his thoughts
[37:23] because his thoughts are eternal
[37:25] all right now he has to transmit them
[37:28] thoughts down to you and i okay
[37:30] right
[37:32] so he opens up our understanding as we
[37:34] were bringing out about the disciples
[37:35] during the book of luke where it says he
[37:37] opened their understanding of the
[37:39] scriptures
[37:40] but you know he never gave them the new
[37:42] birth right there right he just opened
[37:44] up their understanding that's right amen
[37:46] we can have her understand it open today
[37:48] not even how did you burp right
[37:51] that's where the trouble's at because
[37:53] that's our thoughts
[37:56] right see our thoughts is what's messed
[37:58] this whole bible up amen
[38:00] right
[38:02] right
[38:03] our ways of thinking
[38:07] instead of taking what god says
[38:10] we try to dissect it in some way to
[38:13] figure out some other way instead of
[38:15] saying exactly what he's saying that's
[38:17] right
[38:20] how many trinitarians they use the same
[38:22] bible we used to prove three gods
[38:24] right
[38:26] that the oneness people they use this
[38:28] same bible to prove that they're just
[38:29] one like your finger
[38:34] using the same scriptures you use
[38:36] to show the one true and living god
[38:39] when it's court and what thoughts you're
[38:40] having
[38:44] okay according to your thoughts
[38:48] what are your thoughts today
[38:51] that's right
[38:53] i probably wouldn't want to know them
[38:57] you know
[38:58] because you don't tell them what you're
[38:59] sitting there thinking about me
[39:04] and i'm glad that i don't have that
[39:05] ability i can read faces enough that's
[39:08] right
[39:09] you know
[39:10] i'm out of trouble with that i can read
[39:12] faces and
[39:13] you know
[39:14] i mean if you're sitting there
[39:17] then i know you're not agreeing with me
[39:19] see that's no problem
[39:24] but now listen i'm not going to get into
[39:27] the thought of what we need
[39:29] but i want to just read you the first
[39:31] one that's on the backside of the last
[39:33] quilt that you have it's called 1a the
[39:36] back side of it
[39:38] all right addition to what we've been at
[39:40] it
[39:41] and i want to just read that and then
[39:42] we'll just go from that little thought
[39:44] about what it is because
[39:46] see i want you to look at what god's
[39:47] thoughts are
[39:54] and see what really his thoughts are
[39:58] they're a part of him
[40:00] we've been through this
[40:01] they're eternal
[40:03] he can't have another thought all of
[40:05] that
[40:07] but what's this little one quote type
[40:09] together from a message called adoption
[40:11] 1965-18
[40:16] so the inside of that was attributes
[40:21] now an attribute is like you're an
[40:24] attribute of your father
[40:26] right
[40:27] it means something coming forth from but
[40:30] now watch what i'm saying
[40:32] so don't get the wrong idea of attribute
[40:35] attribute is not something coming forth
[40:36] from
[40:38] is something it's a part of that
[40:41] that's doing it moving over into another
[40:43] way
[40:44] because see it's not god
[40:47] and another god coming out
[40:49] or another identity or another person or
[40:51] another idea
[40:53] that's not sure
[40:57] an attribute simply means that we were
[41:00] trying to bring out the other day of
[41:01] where the in the book of acts there
[41:04] where paul was talking to him on mars
[41:05] hill and he said we're the offspring of
[41:08] god amen
[41:10] that's right
[41:11] now the offspring of god even to the
[41:13] heathen
[41:14] even to those that's why he could bring
[41:16] that out to them he said even your poets
[41:19] have said that we're the offspring of
[41:21] god
[41:22] see because the people have believed
[41:25] that in other words a cun a whole
[41:27] country believes that their leader
[41:29] especially the kings and the the thing
[41:32] they believe that that king was their
[41:34] god incarnate
[41:37] that he come down to them in that person
[41:40] now they know he's not the god he's the
[41:42] person that the god is in right amen all
[41:45] right
[41:46] and see they writ that's what they
[41:47] believe
[41:48] so paul was saying that even your own
[41:50] poet said it because you heather and you
[41:52] believe
[41:55] that you're the offspring of god and you
[41:57] know what every person in the world
[42:01] every person in the world i don't care
[42:02] how mean how good whatever it is every
[42:05] person in the world is an offspring of
[42:07] god in the fact of creation right
[42:09] because where did we come from
[42:11] well my mom and daddy had me well how
[42:13] did they get you
[42:16] you go and study how they get here and
[42:19] you'll find out a lot of difference now
[42:20] my brother brother brandon would sit
[42:22] like this one down he said the virgin
[42:23] birth is a simple thing
[42:25] he said god just created egg and sperm
[42:27] or what the words you want to use germ
[42:29] or whatever he said he just created them
[42:31] and put them in the wounds of mary
[42:34] he said with the natural birth
[42:38] millions of germs and millions of eggs
[42:40] coming what determines whether it's
[42:42] going to be red-headed brown-headed
[42:43] green-headed or white-headed nowadays
[42:49] god is in all of it
[42:52] but that's not his offspring the way he
[42:54] wants them that's his offspring by
[42:56] creation he wants his offspring to be of
[42:59] the same thing that he is or the same
[43:01] sources he is we'll get back to that
[43:05] but let's look at the prophet this let's
[43:07] see what he says about a an attribute do
[43:09] you understand what an act an attribute
[43:11] then is not see wade is my attribute
[43:15] in other words that means he come from
[43:17] me
[43:18] you understand
[43:20] then josh is his attribute that meant he
[43:22] come from him
[43:24] see if i'd adopted him into the family
[43:26] he wouldn't be my attribute
[43:31] no matter how much i don't know how much
[43:33] that i would give him he could never be
[43:35] my offspring
[43:38] all right so then what does god say
[43:42] he says we're in offspring so watching
[43:44] inside of that was an at was attributes
[43:48] which meant
[43:49] which meant that he was
[43:51] inside of this great ella ella
[43:56] a-l-e-h elohim
[43:59] was an attribute all right you know what
[44:01] an attribute is
[44:04] or let me say it like this
[44:06] was a nature
[44:09] look how simple a man could make
[44:11] the great words of science the great
[44:14] words of the theologians of all of the
[44:17] logos theophany attributes etc etc
[44:19] coming down and boy they got it all
[44:21] blowed up and the prophet just said it's
[44:23] the nature
[44:26] now watch what he said that's so the
[44:28] little fellas would get it
[44:30] and i'm one of the little fellas that
[44:32] has to get it that way
[44:36] pretty good point here
[44:38] inside of him was the nature to be a
[44:40] father
[44:43] but he self-existed
[44:46] there ain't nothing for him to be a
[44:49] father by
[44:52] this is back in the beginning right
[44:54] and now down inside of that was
[44:57] something else
[44:58] that he was god
[45:01] and the god is an object of worship
[45:04] but he was self-existent
[45:07] ella elohim hella elohim so there was
[45:11] nothing to worship him
[45:15] inside of that he was a savior
[45:17] and there's nothing lost to be saved
[45:21] inside of that he was a healer
[45:24] but there was nothing sick to be healed
[45:28] or nothing to be sick
[45:32] now do you get the picture
[45:34] so his attributes
[45:36] his nature
[45:38] produced
[45:39] what is today
[45:43] amen
[45:44] all right now in him was to be father
[45:49] and no children
[45:51] so that does away with pre-existence
[45:53] sometimes
[45:55] we wouldn't back there's people
[45:57] like that
[45:59] in him was to be a
[46:01] be god there was nothing to worship him
[46:04] he finally made angels they worshipped
[46:05] him
[46:06] inside of him was to be a savior but
[46:09] there was nothing lost
[46:12] inside of him was to be a healer but
[46:14] there was nothing sick
[46:16] all right
[46:18] now
[46:20] then if that be true
[46:24] his attributes being his nature
[46:31] his nature
[46:34] all right being a nature of god
[46:36] we can look at it and see him as he
[46:38] displays it
[46:42] came down through and he made man
[46:44] knowing man would fall
[46:47] but he made man he made angels they
[46:49] worshipped him that made him god he made
[46:51] man
[46:52] man sinned he could be the savior
[46:56] there was sickness follower to sin
[46:58] so it could be the healer
[47:01] it's like i told you the other day
[47:04] see he's never been the kind of father
[47:07] that he wanted to be
[47:08] right even though you would call him
[47:11] father in the old testament but that was
[47:13] only
[47:14] the part of creation
[47:18] he could never be the right father until
[47:20] you would bring it on over into this
[47:21] time or the the new testament
[47:23] dispensation right
[47:25] because that's where he wanted to be
[47:26] fathered
[47:28] i'll get back to this sunday a little
[47:30] more on but on christ the mr god
[47:32] revealed the prophet said that was the
[47:34] only way that he could be father was to
[47:36] be the son of man amen that's right
[47:39] and we think jesus was just playing
[47:41] around and just goofing off and just
[47:43] talking and just you know going along
[47:45] just
[47:47] he was sowing the seed
[47:51] he was showing the seed of the word
[47:56] now you and i must be that word
[48:01] you and i must become that word
[48:03] right amen now how can we start it
[48:07] see our thoughts and well what do you
[48:09] mean i'll just be it see that's our
[48:11] cause
[48:12] now that won't fit god's ways
[48:14] right so god's thought says what
[48:20] we're in sin we're away from god
[48:23] there's no way
[48:24] to be
[48:26] able to call him father in the correct
[48:28] way
[48:31] jewry is our creator but that's not the
[48:33] father he wanted to be
[48:36] but that son of man would stand there
[48:38] which would god almighty in human flesh
[48:41] not another god that's right the bible
[48:43] said in him dwelt in the fullness of the
[48:44] godhead bodily
[48:46] all right so when he walked the shores
[48:48] of galilee all of god was to be revealed
[48:51] to mankind was there in that person
[48:54] walk in there with it i read it
[48:58] then
[49:02] he had to release that life that was
[49:04] inside of him
[49:05] but before he could release the lie what
[49:07] was it what was the use of releasing the
[49:09] life
[49:12] see we thought jesus christ has come to
[49:13] die
[49:14] matthew mark luke and john is the most
[49:16] important part of the bible that you
[49:18] need to read
[49:20] i mean that's just the way i put it i'm
[49:21] sorry because we we call it just you
[49:24] know well that's just the gospels
[49:27] if you really get in there and see what
[49:29] he was doing
[49:31] he had to bring all of that before he
[49:34] could die
[49:35] what good would it have done if he'd
[49:37] just went out there and died
[49:38] and gave his life
[49:40] right
[49:41] who would it come back on
[49:47] how could it come back upon anybody
[49:50] because there never was anybody in the
[49:52] bible that were born again and didn't
[49:54] hear a message first
[49:55] you showed me that in the bible that's
[49:57] right
[50:00] brother dale i i didn't i i wasn't
[50:02] reading the bible i was doing nothing i
[50:04] was just sitting there
[50:05] the holy ghost fell on me well all right
[50:07] glory
[50:09] but it could only fall on what you
[50:11] already heard right
[50:14] you're going to tell me you hadn't heard
[50:15] anything before then
[50:20] it was necessary in the bible that a
[50:23] message be preached
[50:25] peter had to come the holy ghost
[50:27] couldn't fall it fell onto them in the
[50:29] upper room because jesus had planted
[50:30] that seed right amen that's right
[50:34] then they preached the message
[50:36] and the holy ghost came amen
[50:41] over it who would it coney is house
[50:45] they had heard about jesus they heard
[50:46] about the things
[50:48] but a man had to go and talk to him
[50:51] why because the seat could only come
[50:53] through the body
[50:58] all right then in doing that then see we
[51:01] look back and we see
[51:03] that his attributes has been displayed
[51:08] savior healer
[51:10] father
[51:13] they've been displayed upon the earth
[51:15] in people
[51:19] but can't we look at it and see by the
[51:21] new birth
[51:23] we become the offspring of god amen
[51:27] right not that we were born
[51:29] you know that way
[51:30] we were born in sin
[51:32] generally to iniquity the
[51:35] psalmist says
[51:37] went forth from our mother's womb a liar
[51:40] paul gets over in the scriptures and
[51:42] says
[51:43] nothing good in none of us
[51:45] we all had our conversation our manner
[51:47] of life
[51:49] like everybody else
[51:52] see that in doing that
[51:55] he had to come and die
[51:57] but before he could die
[51:59] he had to sow the seeds
[52:04] you see what i got to say brother dale
[52:05] never met rip read matthew mark luke and
[52:07] john
[52:08] how much you heard a message right
[52:10] that's right amen
[52:12] somebody told you about it mama
[52:15] uncle or you read the word amen
[52:17] what's the difference when no man didn't
[52:20] tell me no you read the bible
[52:22] right who's that who wrote this come on
[52:25] all right
[52:26] that's right i'm looking at the book of
[52:28] isaiah and i don't think
[52:30] jude wrote that right
[52:32] do you
[52:34] right i mean
[52:38] so you understand what i'm trying to get
[52:39] to
[52:42] we are supposed to display his nature
[52:48] then it was for ordained that we would
[52:50] have to come into the world to be lost
[52:55] so that his nature could be displayed or
[52:57] his attributes could be displayed but he
[52:59] couldn't make us lost
[53:02] and judges were being lost
[53:04] right
[53:05] so we had to put us three more agencies
[53:06] that bring that one ago and then if he
[53:08] put us on the freeway agency he left us
[53:10] and we made a
[53:12] choice now come on why does the bible or
[53:15] why do we talk about you know we use it
[53:17] basically because it's not really
[53:18] written out is that
[53:20] we talk about the age of accountability
[53:25] you know there's no such way of judging
[53:27] the age of accountability because that's
[53:29] what it means accountability
[53:31] a person who's who is not capable of
[53:34] making choices etc
[53:36] their accountability is a whole lot
[53:37] different than anyone else
[53:40] agreed
[53:42] but see god knows that person and knows
[53:45] exactly what it takes to contact that
[53:47] person
[53:50] and like i said
[53:53] we think that big things deep things oh
[53:55] brother you need to preach simple things
[53:57] i try to
[53:59] because you talk about deep things
[54:04] and when you do you don't even consider
[54:07] that in the book of acts those people
[54:08] have never heard a sermon whatsoever the
[54:11] three thousand
[54:12] a lot of them never probably heard the
[54:14] name jesus
[54:18] they just happened to be there when the
[54:20] preacher started preaching
[54:23] but god pricked their heart
[54:25] because that's what jesus said no man
[54:27] can come unto me unless the father draws
[54:29] him
[54:30] amen so if you've come to god for
[54:32] salvation you back on one thing god
[54:34] called you if he didn't you don't have
[54:36] salvation all right that's right simple
[54:39] plain
[54:41] you don't have it
[54:44] all right
[54:46] but get the point of what i'm saying the
[54:47] nature
[54:50] of anything
[54:52] animals have a nature
[54:55] no but people have a nature right
[55:00] you you have been around here long
[55:02] enough until you know my
[55:04] nature you know what i know yours too
[55:09] i know how to talk to you
[55:11] because of your nature
[55:13] but you know what i've talked to one of
[55:15] you
[55:17] but i can't talk to the other one the
[55:18] same way
[55:20] come on
[55:22] because it's a different nature
[55:25] your nature is what caused you to be
[55:29] a mother and a father
[55:32] he said no i didn't know we just got
[55:34] married well what do you think i'm
[55:35] talking about right
[55:38] it was the nature of an individual
[55:41] right
[55:42] why did you pick the wife you did
[55:46] what if you women pick the husband when
[55:47] you picked
[55:50] when i agree with most of you most of us
[55:52] are ugly old man watch me
[55:54] what was the beautiful choice that you
[55:56] made
[55:57] i was laughing the other day we was
[55:58] listening right around talking about
[55:59] that little girl you know said he said
[56:01] what in the world you think about that
[56:02] boy said oh said he's got pretty feet
[56:04] and said he smells so good
[56:07] you know she just want that that's the
[56:09] choice she wanted to make
[56:11] that was her thoughts he said i don't
[56:13] care if he looked as ugly as mud and had
[56:16] carboxyuse
[56:17] he said if he's a christian
[56:21] how many of us chose people because they
[56:23] were christians
[56:29] you know
[56:31] or did we do like i've always tried to
[56:33] tell you
[56:34] you marry first for lust
[56:36] hormone factors and stuff like that
[56:39] causes you to get married
[56:41] then you learn to love you so oh no it
[56:43] was love at first sight well what was
[56:44] you looking at the cute little feet or
[56:46] how they smell
[56:47] all right
[56:50] which one was your life
[56:55] i mean if god told you now that's my
[56:57] wife or that's my husband that's not all
[56:59] about that now
[57:00] i'm not a dummy
[57:03] i'm just saying that god's nature
[57:06] was all of his attributes right
[57:09] that's right
[57:12] you know he can't change them
[57:14] that's right and you know he never got
[57:16] new attributes coming this way i've
[57:18] tried to tell you that for what 40 years
[57:22] and god's descended down he never
[57:25] increased his attributes
[57:27] he either had him or he doesn't have it
[57:30] right
[57:31] he always was a father
[57:34] he said yeah but he couldn't be father
[57:35] because he now there's your thoughts my
[57:37] thoughts are not your thoughts god said
[57:39] he was a father that's right amen that's
[57:42] right god said he was a healer god said
[57:44] he was a
[57:45] was god
[57:47] we see our thoughts gets involved no no
[57:50] no he had to have some that's a display
[57:56] the angels displayed the fact of who he
[57:58] was
[58:00] he never gained attributes by creating
[58:02] angels
[58:03] right
[58:06] he never gained any attributes by
[58:08] creating people right
[58:12] we just made him come out in the
[58:13] manifestation
[58:15] of the things that he wanted to be he
[58:17] always had those attributes
[58:20] but his attributes is his thoughts
[58:24] god's talks are eternal amen
[58:29] so then what do we look at
[58:33] looking back and seeing that before the
[58:34] foundation of the world
[58:36] we were chosen in him
[58:40] now if there's only one eternal
[58:45] all right
[58:47] there's only one eternal and that's god
[58:49] agree all right
[58:50] you know you don't have two or three
[58:51] eternals you know how this that's why we
[58:53] don't believe in hell being eternal
[58:54] because if hell's eternal you'd have to
[58:56] put god's own life into hell and that
[58:57] won't work that's right amen so we don't
[59:00] believe that right that could be
[59:01] billions of billions or trillions of
[59:03] trillions of trillions of trees it could
[59:04] be more than our national debt
[59:07] that'll get every one of you
[59:09] every one of you can tell how many trees
[59:10] what is it thirteen
[59:14] one
[59:14] fourteen uh oh done gone up and won the
[59:16] lights not checked exactly right 14
[59:19] trillion dollars
[59:22] going up now that's
[59:24] but you know what
[59:26] eternal is a whole lot greater than all
[59:29] of us that's right
[59:31] so hell could be for billions of
[59:33] billions and trillions of years
[59:35] but it can't be eternal
[59:38] because
[59:39] you have to put god's own life there
[59:42] and is god's own life going to be in
[59:43] hell
[59:44] i thought the bible tells you what hell
[59:46] was created for
[59:47] and said it was created for the devil
[59:49] and his angels
[59:51] you know that people are
[59:53] intruders into hell
[59:55] now don't get on that but we are we were
[59:57] intruding into hell why because it would
[59:59] only make for the devil in this angle
[1:00:03] which is going to be full of people
[1:00:05] because they chose to go that way why
[1:00:06] because their thoughts got involved
[1:00:11] they're all tied up in our own thoughts
[1:00:12] and we thought we had it right
[1:00:15] what do you mean brother dale the bible
[1:00:17] says
[1:00:19] that the worm dies not
[1:00:23] the bible says there will be an eternal
[1:00:25] judgment
[1:00:32] you better go back and find out what
[1:00:33] that worm is because really that worm is
[1:00:35] you and i the soul comes it don't die it
[1:00:38] death god has to destroy
[1:00:43] but you see
[1:00:45] looking at god's thoughts
[1:00:50] and seeing to his thoughts or his
[1:00:51] attributes and his attributes is his
[1:00:54] nature right
[1:00:58] so then we would look and see
[1:01:03] what's our nature
[1:01:06] what is our name our nature is supposed
[1:01:08] to be
[1:01:16] you know that he made us
[1:01:19] a god sure amen says your god
[1:01:24] when the word comes that's right
[1:01:26] one because it's saying that we are
[1:01:28] higher than the animal the animal
[1:01:30] doesn't have a soul right he has a
[1:01:32] spiritual life about him and things but
[1:01:33] he he doesn't have a soul that's why he
[1:01:35] can't reason things out right
[1:01:37] he builds the nest the same way in the
[1:01:39] hogs to its own water and everything
[1:01:40] else it doesn't matter what you do with
[1:01:42] it you dress up a hog and powder him up
[1:01:44] and everything you go right back in the
[1:01:45] mud
[1:01:46] because he doesn't have a soul
[1:01:50] but you see church then
[1:01:52] god wants us to find his nature and to
[1:01:55] display his nature that's right amen
[1:01:59] so there was going to have to be a fall
[1:02:03] amen there would have to be a fall
[1:02:06] but god can't make us follow right amen
[1:02:10] that's right so he could give us free
[1:02:12] moral agency hallelujah that's right
[1:02:15] now listen when we come over past adam
[1:02:17] don't misunderstand me we're still free
[1:02:20] moral agents every one of us and we
[1:02:21] can't blame adam and eve but when we
[1:02:23] pass adam we're automatically born
[1:02:25] sinners right
[1:02:26] it's not like adam and eve was born
[1:02:28] perfect i said perfect
[1:02:31] the way i wanted to be perfect not
[1:02:32] eternal
[1:02:33] they were perfect
[1:02:37] but you see you and i when we were born
[1:02:40] we were already brought into the sin gap
[1:02:43] but we can't blame them see we have a
[1:02:46] free moral agency that takes over the
[1:02:48] age of accountability as i said a moment
[1:02:50] ago and starts working on us right right
[1:02:53] i mean how many of you can remember when
[1:02:55] you was a little
[1:02:56] you know a child or whatever age of
[1:02:59] accountability
[1:03:00] but you remember that there was
[1:03:01] something dealing with you
[1:03:04] right
[1:03:06] but yet you turned it away
[1:03:10] see then that was our free moral agency
[1:03:13] oh we didn't want christianity
[1:03:17] we wanted to be like the world
[1:03:20] you know what that's what we got
[1:03:23] but you know what that didn't stop god
[1:03:28] his nature was to steal to be a savior a
[1:03:30] healer and etc
[1:03:33] and so he just kept waiting on us
[1:03:36] waiting on us waiting on it
[1:03:40] the bible said it's all about noah
[1:03:42] 120 years
[1:03:45] god waited amen you know what
[1:03:48] he didn't get one more soul
[1:03:50] but he still waited
[1:03:53] didn't change the thing it still comes
[1:03:55] he waited
[1:03:56] that's a wonderful god you know what
[1:03:58] that is that's his nature
[1:04:01] amen
[1:04:03] his nature is to not to be and to do
[1:04:05] things faster so i signed the other day
[1:04:07] my wife's readings were going down the
[1:04:08] road and said something about god
[1:04:10] doesn't do things fast or something you
[1:04:12] know
[1:04:14] he just does it slow and gradual
[1:04:19] you know what the sun draws millions of
[1:04:20] gallons of water out of the ocean every
[1:04:22] day takes it up
[1:04:23] drops right back down on us don't make a
[1:04:25] better racket
[1:04:29] but see we can't figure that out
[1:04:32] because we can't get the right thoughts
[1:04:37] you've heard him tell that
[1:04:39] when they started to go into outer space
[1:04:41] they had to learn where everything would
[1:04:42] be and every rocket would be and
[1:04:44] everything would be because they knew
[1:04:45] there'd be a lot of them up there and
[1:04:46] they had to figure it out so they get
[1:04:48] the the days and things and start
[1:04:51] figuring it out you know what they wound
[1:04:52] up one day mission
[1:04:54] they had to get that calculated
[1:04:56] correctly because they couldn't shut
[1:04:57] them rockets off
[1:04:59] you know what they couldn't find it they
[1:05:01] went back to the bible
[1:05:03] and went back to the bible if you
[1:05:04] remember the man there was telling about
[1:05:06] the one that was talking about the the
[1:05:08] 15 years he said you know let the sun go
[1:05:11] back
[1:05:14] but it said about a day
[1:05:16] they ran it back in some way knew
[1:05:18] exactly that there was lacking about 20
[1:05:20] minutes
[1:05:23] oh that was scooping the sun stand still
[1:05:26] with joshua all right
[1:05:28] and then the man where it was to turn
[1:05:30] back
[1:05:31] turn back so many degrees you know what
[1:05:33] that was for 20 minutes they knew
[1:05:34] exactly i had you read the bible and
[1:05:35] believed it
[1:05:37] you know if we read it i don't believe
[1:05:39] we'll be worried about going to mars
[1:05:41] what we're going to mars for
[1:05:45] now i agree that all this junk that we
[1:05:47] have down here they need to some way get
[1:05:50] it up somewhere
[1:05:51] but you know
[1:05:54] pollute this place
[1:05:56] but still
[1:05:57] get the point of what i'm trying to get
[1:05:58] you to see and then we'll quit
[1:06:02] god's nature
[1:06:06] that's his attribute
[1:06:08] that's right that's just too small for
[1:06:10] us to think about right
[1:06:13] you can think about god being some kind
[1:06:14] of a great and miraculous
[1:06:17] situation or something you could think
[1:06:18] on it maybe but
[1:06:21] to think of how simple it is
[1:06:25] that almighty god came to earth to give
[1:06:27] his life for you and me amen
[1:06:30] amen couldn't send a son
[1:06:34] he became the son amen
[1:06:37] that's right
[1:06:39] to take my place
[1:06:42] so then he's my brother
[1:06:44] he's my father he's my healer he's my
[1:06:47] savior
[1:06:48] he's my all in all
[1:06:51] and jesus is his name
[1:06:53] amen what about your thoughts what are
[1:06:55] your thoughts about it
[1:07:00] you know that god has never asked you
[1:07:02] and i what our thoughts are i run that
[1:07:04] through the bible
[1:07:05] i thought i had one night running back
[1:07:07] looking
[1:07:12] you know god don't ask us about our
[1:07:13] thoughts
[1:07:17] he just said my thoughts
[1:07:20] are higher than your thoughts so our
[1:07:22] thoughts are not even in the way now
[1:07:24] it's all right you can run it back
[1:07:25] you'll find thoughts in there and you
[1:07:27] find people had good thoughts
[1:07:31] they had good thoughts
[1:07:35] but god's thoughts are so much higher
[1:07:38] right
[1:07:40] so much higher
[1:07:42] because he's almighty god
[1:07:45] let's see
[1:07:49] yeah psalms 92 and 5 i think it is where
[1:07:51] he said that thoughts are very deep
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:55] god's thoughts are very deep
[1:07:59] but you know when he displays it to you
[1:08:01] and i and gives it to us not deep no
[1:08:03] more
[1:08:04] that's right simple when he reveals it
[1:08:08] simple when he reveals but get the point
[1:08:10] we'll quit i mean
[1:08:14] the only way
[1:08:16] that god could be a father
[1:08:20] the way he wanted to be
[1:08:23] was to be the son of man that's right
[1:08:26] all right
[1:08:28] because that way he sold to sea you know
[1:08:30] what he sold
[1:08:34] he sold you and i am
[1:08:38] do we believe we're the seed of god amen
[1:08:40] don't we spend a lot of time talking
[1:08:42] about we're the seed of god
[1:08:44] we're the gene of god where it is
[1:08:45] attributes and things don't we don't
[1:08:46] spend a lot talking about it we'll see
[1:08:48] then we are his seed
[1:08:51] you know what he'd done he sold her he
[1:08:53] sewed us into the earth
[1:08:55] you see into the earth not into the
[1:08:56] ground not into the it's not talking
[1:08:59] about that
[1:09:02] but go back in there and read to matthew
[1:09:03] mark luke and john and find out
[1:09:06] right that you can find your own place
[1:09:08] that's right
[1:09:10] jesus said unless a corner wheat dies
[1:09:11] and falls into the ground said invite
[1:09:13] along and said if if it goes into the
[1:09:15] ground comes forth
[1:09:16] multiple forms
[1:09:19] well that's what he was telling was
[1:09:20] going to take place he was going to have
[1:09:21] to go to calvary and die but then when
[1:09:23] it would happen he would come back and
[1:09:24] live in uni
[1:09:28] see he sowed us into the earth because
[1:09:30] that's the way he can be the son of the
[1:09:32] son of man can be our father
[1:09:35] no i want god to be my father you're not
[1:09:37] even getting god's thoughts
[1:09:45] to be a father would mean that he would
[1:09:47] have to have seed
[1:09:52] and our terminologies today we call this
[1:09:54] that but still there is no such thing as
[1:09:56] being a father
[1:09:58] unless you have an offspring that's
[1:10:00] right that right right i don't care what
[1:10:03] you you know you inherit somebody you
[1:10:04] marry into somebody and they call you
[1:10:06] father but that's not true
[1:10:08] you're not a father unless you have
[1:10:09] offspring that's right correct god is
[1:10:12] not a father unless he has offspring his
[1:10:14] offspring is his children
[1:10:16] we are his children
[1:10:21] we are his children
[1:10:24] that's how we were in him
[1:10:27] the eternal life that he had in him is
[1:10:29] now in you and me
[1:10:31] that's where we were chosen at
[1:10:36] we were chosen back there
[1:10:41] because we have eternal life
[1:10:44] eternal life means you have no beginning
[1:10:45] no ending you say did you come into the
[1:10:47] world with eternal life we come into the
[1:10:49] world with representation from
[1:10:51] predestination
[1:10:54] that's right it's on the future home
[1:11:00] we come into the world and go out
[1:11:02] knowing we would want to be saved so he
[1:11:04] would have it for us
[1:11:09] he would have it for us to be ready for
[1:11:10] us when we got here
[1:11:13] and that all he would have to do is
[1:11:14] cross our path
[1:11:17] oh if i'd just had somebody
[1:11:21] god crossed my face and i was about 11
[1:11:23] years old you've heard me tell about it
[1:11:24] the what i saw whatever
[1:11:26] if i just had somebody
[1:11:29] i started searching for that god
[1:11:32] i wanted somebody
[1:11:35] when that prophet said job wanted one
[1:11:37] day that he got to the place that he
[1:11:38] wanted somebody to be able to reach up
[1:11:40] and get almighty god and come down and
[1:11:42] get him and bring them together
[1:11:48] see that's what jesus christ did when he
[1:11:49] came to earth to make that up
[1:11:51] that's what i wanted
[1:11:53] i wanted to meet that god
[1:11:56] but you wouldn't nobody could talk to me
[1:11:58] about it
[1:12:00] the best thing tell me so what you need
[1:12:02] to do you need to go up here to a
[1:12:03] pentecostal church because you know they
[1:12:04] didn't talk like i was talking
[1:12:08] see i wanted to know about god
[1:12:12] anybody that's ever crossed the path of
[1:12:14] god or god crossed her past really
[1:12:17] you want to know about him don't you
[1:12:21] write these quotes back sunday we'll
[1:12:22] pick up and go on because
[1:12:25] you know
[1:12:28] if god's thoughts are eternal
[1:12:32] and we are his attributes we're just as
[1:12:34] eternal as he is by the new birth
[1:12:37] and you know what that makes us part of
[1:12:39] him
[1:12:42] there's the children of god there's his
[1:12:44] offspring
[1:12:45] is to be part of him
[1:12:49] he said no i just can't hardly see it
[1:12:51] that way you're making it too too
[1:12:53] natural and and everything well why not
[1:12:56] he was made natural
[1:12:58] that's right
[1:12:59] he dwelled on this earth he said unless
[1:13:01] you believe that i am he you'll die in
[1:13:02] your sins
[1:13:06] well now what that was brother dale was
[1:13:07] the second person of the trinity you
[1:13:09] know
[1:13:10] well we don't believe that
[1:13:13] that's right
[1:13:16] see there's where our thoughts get
[1:13:18] involved our ideas
[1:13:20] you know what's called you know what
[1:13:21] caused organized religion or causes
[1:13:24] ideas of mankind right
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:27] that's right that's why we're not
[1:13:29] against the people
[1:13:31] were against the system that caused it
[1:13:33] to be an organization
[1:13:36] we're not against anybody
[1:13:38] catholics it doesn't matter what
[1:13:41] we're just against the system
[1:13:45] that made the people that way and you
[1:13:47] know what
[1:13:48] every one of us used to be part of those
[1:13:50] systems right
[1:13:52] we just don't want to admit it
[1:13:55] we were part of that system that's right
[1:13:57] carrying their bible
[1:13:59] and believe in their doctrine
[1:14:06] so what do we believe what is it now
[1:14:08] have our thoughts been changed
[1:14:13] it better be yes sir
[1:14:15] because our nature is supposed to be
[1:14:16] changed
[1:14:18] if our nature's changed it should bring
[1:14:20] you thoughts
[1:14:22] come on brother
[1:14:23] it should bring new thoughts
[1:14:28] because god's thoughts are eternal
[1:14:30] that's right amen
[1:14:35] god's word is eternal you say no no
[1:14:37] brother dallas you burn that up yeah but
[1:14:39] you can't burn up god's word
[1:14:43] to show you what they tried one day
[1:14:46] they tried to burn shadrach meshach and
[1:14:47] abednego didn't he
[1:14:53] that was god's word
[1:14:55] they tried to burn it wouldn't work
[1:14:59] just hot enough burned the bands off
[1:15:01] their hands
[1:15:03] that's all they could do
[1:15:08] god's word is determined let's stand
[1:15:09] together think of these things
[1:15:11] 288
[1:15:13] jesus is coming soon amen
[1:15:18] you have a need just come and let's
[1:15:19] believe and let's see
[1:15:23] she studied god's word because that's
[1:15:25] his thoughts
[1:15:57] will be
[1:16:16] we had
[1:16:21] are nothing compared to the thoughts of
[1:16:23] god
