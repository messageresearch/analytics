[7:53] in and look at sheet rocks up and
[7:55] everything ready for painting maybe
[7:57] we'll get it pretty quick John 1 in the
[8:01] beginning was the word and the Word was
[8:03] with God and the Word was God the same
[8:05] was in the beginning with God all things
[8:08] were made by him and without him was not
[8:10] anything made that was made
[8:12] in him was life and the life was the
[8:16] light of men and the light shining in
[8:18] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[8:20] it not there's no way that darkness can
[8:23] comprehend God's Word it has to be
[8:28] revealed there's no way I hope you're
[8:31] catching on to some of that part of it
[8:33] by now of what we're trying to making it
[8:36] so hard and straight ok visions 1 Paul
[8:40] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[8:42] of God to the Saints which are at
[8:45] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[8:48] Jesus not written to the world written
[8:51] to Christians about Christians grace be
[8:54] unto you and peace from God our Father
[8:56] and from the Lord Jesus Christ this it
[8:59] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[9:01] Christ who has blessed us with all
[9:03] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[9:06] in Christ and here's what we're going to
[9:08] be dealing with according as he has
[9:11] chosen us in him before the foundation
[9:15] of the world that we should be holding
[9:18] without blame before him in love having
[9:22] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[9:25] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[9:27] according to the good pleasure of his
[9:30] will to the praise of the glory of His
[9:33] grace
[9:33] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[9:38] beloved you may be seated the Lord had
[9:40] his blessing to the reading of the word
[9:43] now I want to try I didn't give them
[9:47] anything to pull up on the screens any
[9:50] quotes because we may read a lot but I I
[9:52] want to just try to get a point to you I
[9:56] want to make sure you understand what
[9:59] I'm talking about the way I'm trying to
[10:02] express things and what I believe
[10:05] because there's so much controversy
[10:07] among the believers of the message of
[10:10] the hour and it's are talking about you
[10:15] know one group believes you were coming
[10:18] to the world with eternal life you know
[10:19] another one believes you come with this
[10:21] seed another group believes you come
[10:23] with this and there's just all kind of
[10:26] things and you know I've always just
[10:29] been honest and straight I'll get back
[10:31] to this and the message in a minute see
[10:34] people would actually believe that the
[10:37] new birth would just be God
[10:40] opening your understanding of the word
[10:42] well I hope you were following me there
[10:45] Wednesday when we went through talking
[10:48] about how that Moses is understanding
[10:53] was open all the prophets understandings
[10:57] were open to them you know the things
[11:01] that you know was made known to them
[11:04] great wonderful thing but none of that
[11:07] gave them eternal life so you can hold
[11:10] the Bible says you can actually know all
[11:13] the mysteries now that's that's
[11:17] something they need to know the entire
[11:18] Bible all the mystery that's the
[11:20] scripture but how not Christ our love
[11:24] which is expressing these dark then
[11:27] you're sounding brass and tinkling
[11:29] cymbal so you can understand all the
[11:32] things and all like that and still not
[11:34] have eternal life and sees in you and
[11:38] how the thought people would say well
[11:40] all I need is the new birth is all I
[11:43] need is just to have an understanding I
[11:44] come into this message so I know I'm
[11:46] born again
[11:47] well the devil believes it so where's
[11:49] here I don't like you calling me the
[11:52] devil I didn't call you the devil you
[11:53] called your own self that's your
[11:56] situation you're the one that putting
[11:58] yourself in the category not me
[11:59] I'm trying to be honest and straight all
[12:02] right and see then to see eternal life
[12:06] you know then we need to understand the
[12:12] scriptures and the way to brain if the
[12:17] new birth is just an opening of your
[12:19] understanding as I said my didn't Moses
[12:21] and him get it why didn't a little woman
[12:23] at the whales we're bringing out
[12:24] Wednesday she's over in the park close
[12:28] to the New Testament right what about
[12:31] the disciples in Luke that had remember
[12:35] the ones on the road to Emmaus and Jesus
[12:38] walking with him he opened their
[12:40] understanding to the scriptures I was
[12:43] after his resurrection why didn't they
[12:45] get eternal life wanted to have to go
[12:48] wait in the upper room so they go
[12:51] running back and remember in Luke and
[12:53] they come back to the disciples then
[12:55] Jesus appears to him and opens their
[12:58] understanding of the scriptures
[13:01] if all we need is a new birth is to get
[13:04] our understanding open look what you're
[13:06] saying the intellectual people would
[13:09] have it over the rest of us because it's
[13:11] doing yeah but but we are I believe that
[13:15] I believe the new birth is the opening
[13:17] of the word yes siree that's the way
[13:19] I've always told it it is the opening of
[13:22] the word but it's not just opening like
[13:25] parts that we can understand there's
[13:28] things we can follow that was why I was
[13:30] trying Wednesday night to express that
[13:34] God in his mind so everything that would
[13:38] ever be in this world right but that's
[13:42] where we link back to in our
[13:43] predestination we go back there and stop
[13:45] but I don't want to be just something he
[13:49] thought of I want to be a part of the
[13:52] very thinker because that's Paul it's
[13:55] the mind that was in Christ being you
[13:59] right see I want to be a part of the
[14:03] very one that was doing the thinking
[14:06] that's the only way you can have eternal
[14:07] life the eternal life is a person it's
[14:12] the person of Jesus Christ that's why he
[14:14] had to die to release that life to be
[14:17] able to come back on us if not you're
[14:20] just dealing with head knowledge you see
[14:24] yeah but my understandings been open I
[14:28] hope you followed me Wednesday and
[14:31] following me now the entire Old
[14:33] Testament people all of those prophets
[14:35] their understanding was open but it
[14:38] never gave them eternal life if he did
[14:41] why did Jesus have to come and die what
[14:44] would be the purpose of the death of
[14:45] Christ I thought the purpose was was to
[14:49] release that one that was within him so
[14:52] that one that was within him could come
[14:55] back into me and you and give us a new
[14:58] birth I mean that's what I thought if I
[15:03] missed it I'm sorry see then it's not
[15:05] just an intellectual understanding I've
[15:09] read six books and listen to two tapes
[15:11] in one day you want to talk about
[15:13] intellectual understanding it but the
[15:16] colleague can verify sit down her a lot
[15:19] of nights and read half the night
[15:21] sitting right there where he's that go
[15:23] to had a wonderful job the good emotion
[15:25] everything but I done my job or not but
[15:29] what's the point I'm talking about he's
[15:31] trying to get you and I to realize what
[15:36] it means the Prophet said it like that
[15:39] the greatest thing in the world to you
[15:42] is to be born again the greatest thing
[15:49] of all lot you can think about your
[15:51] money you can think about all of your
[15:53] doings or your popularity's or or
[15:55] everything else you can think it's worth
[15:57] nothing cuz it'll end but if you've
[16:03] received eternal life now then is where
[16:09] people gets confused you know which
[16:11] brother Adam here safe
[16:13] you come into world with eternal life
[16:18] look at higher we come in the world
[16:20] eternal life but you're not reading the
[16:22] rest of the book you're not reading the
[16:25] rest of the place if you have eternal
[16:27] life today the eternal life you have all
[16:31] ways was eternal is that sensible do we
[16:38] need a great big light bulb to open up
[16:40] open up our understandings of that are
[16:42] just simple plain language if you have
[16:45] the new birth that new birth is eternal
[16:50] life because it's the birth of the word
[16:51] that you've taken in hell and God come
[16:54] in quick and it that's why I argue with
[16:57] those about that where I come with a
[16:58] seed and praise God we believe in coming
[17:01] with a seed right but a seed without
[17:06] moisture is no good because that's head
[17:11] knowledge moisture is coming upon the
[17:15] word brings you to a revelation making
[17:18] you a child of God yes what brother Dale
[17:20] I always was what a part about you
[17:23] always was that's all I've ever asked is
[17:29] your body's your spiritus your soul
[17:31] which part of you comes esta fun which
[17:34] part of you was always was eternal but
[17:39] you're not taking sensibly listening
[17:42] you're just making quotes to what you
[17:44] want sure if you have eternal life that
[17:51] eternal life always was eternal but
[17:56] there was a time you didn't have it he
[18:01] said no no I come here with it what was
[18:04] it that I know the doctrines that went
[18:09] along with the message to souls
[18:13] God gave you a soul the devil gave you
[18:17] your soul all you had to do is kill the
[18:21] one the devil gave you God's always was
[18:24] eternal
[18:25] well not worse the Newburgh Jesus Christ
[18:28] out in vain well he had to die to
[18:34] release that light that that life could
[18:37] come back in you and I to give us
[18:40] eternal life now come over then the
[18:42] eternal lives you got always was eternal
[18:46] what they're trying to say Wednesday one
[18:49] but a brother said if we're a part of
[18:52] God you realize any but one way to be a
[18:57] part of God that's to take his life into
[19:05] you and I as an uber not to have a
[19:08] knowledge of something knowledge puffeth
[19:12] up what the scripture says they sure
[19:16] will do that a lot right but revelation
[19:19] will humble us but listen church what
[19:28] I've tried to explain eternal life is a
[19:32] person it is the person of Jesus Christ
[19:35] coming and living in you by the new
[19:37] birth and makes your soul eternal so
[19:48] then when the Prophet is saying you
[19:51] always love eternal if you wasn't born
[19:53] don't know certain day that's fine
[19:57] called a new birth that's no start
[19:59] because just remember all it is the new
[20:02] birth when you receive it is the
[20:04] imparting of the life that he had before
[20:06] the world ever begun waiting on you to
[20:09] get here to receive it is that sensible
[20:14] see then why can't we take all of the
[20:17] things of the Prophet put it together
[20:20] and come out with an understanding is it
[20:23] to where we can see that that new birth
[20:29] is the most important thing in this
[20:35] world
[20:39] because if we don't have the new birth
[20:42] we do not have eternal life and we were
[20:48] emphasized over and over going through
[20:51] it to try to brand that look at those
[20:53] Old Testament Saints and the great
[20:54] things that was happening in their lives
[20:57] until the very the very fact that Egypt
[21:00] was plagued by the voice of Moses that
[21:03] he'd called for something it would come
[21:06] but yet he never had eternal life
[21:12] because Jesus Christ had not come and
[21:15] died so the only way you can have
[21:18] eternal life is to have the life of
[21:20] Christ that was bottled within that
[21:23] human element we call Jesus the body and
[21:27] then it was released at Calvary to where
[21:33] it could come back up on us to give our
[21:36] soul eternal life see that way then
[21:41] everything is hinging upon not being you
[21:46] is hinging upon him so we registered
[21:51] aren't Ephesians that said that we were
[21:53] chosen in him before the foundation of
[21:58] the world he just older disciples that I
[22:03] knew you ordained you and all before the
[22:08] foundation of the world the book of the
[22:11] life of the Lamb that was slain
[22:14] revelations art what is it um 13 8 it
[22:19] was before the foundation of the world
[22:23] well your true and it sounds like this
[22:26] that you're confused and you're putting
[22:28] something back here but you don't know
[22:30] how to put it over here what I don't
[22:33] understand why you don't understand
[22:36] that's the best that I can say it I
[22:38] don't understand how you can say you
[22:42] come with eternal lot or could ever
[22:44] think about coming into the world with
[22:47] eternal life
[22:50] now according to my Bible and if it's
[22:53] changed and you tell me according to the
[22:57] way the Bible states it God won't dwell
[22:59] in an unclean vessel that right why do
[23:04] you got to go through justification
[23:07] sanctification and the baptism of the
[23:09] Holy Ghost to have eternal life if it's
[23:12] just a knowledge that you receive and if
[23:18] you have to go through that to receive
[23:20] it then some facts are saying that you
[23:22] don't have it I can't talk about whimsy
[23:26] we talked about redeemed write the word
[23:30] redeemed means to go back where you come
[23:32] from right well you know what if that's
[23:37] right I'm asking you if that's right
[23:43] then that means we fail from somewhere
[23:51] if you come with eternal eyewall you
[23:53] need redeeming I thought eternal I was a
[23:57] redemption right I thought that was
[24:03] redemption was to receive the life of
[24:06] Christ yes but we've got so great
[24:08] revelaed 'add see we got all of this
[24:10] great stuff and Revelator too we no
[24:13] longer have to to go back I'm talking
[24:16] about the same things that have been
[24:18] taught by every religion in the world
[24:20] and basically every religion does talk
[24:23] about what you must be born again they
[24:26] may have different ways of seeing it and
[24:28] things that we wouldn't agree with but
[24:30] at least they talked about it with the
[24:33] people of this message is a lot higher
[24:36] here's I see it that's my new birth I
[24:40] believe this message remember what we
[24:44] talked about Wednesday what did your
[24:45] prophet say the evidence of the Holy
[24:47] Ghost
[24:48] he didn't say whether or not you believe
[24:51] the message that's what we put on it
[24:54] what does it say what the prophets
[24:56] saying he said the Lord straightened him
[24:57] out on a vision and showed him
[25:01] the evidence of the holy ghost was one
[25:03] whether or not the spirit in you agrees
[25:06] with the word but what you needed
[25:09] evidence before you get a burn the
[25:12] evidence comes after the bird right I
[25:14] mean it's a baby here you know that you
[25:17] couldn't they didn't cry you didn't hear
[25:21] them in the womb crying the mama huh
[25:22] y'all hurry up get me out of here
[25:25] not exactly what you see that's what I'm
[25:29] trying to get us to see this reason I
[25:33] set out others won't use the notes I'll
[25:35] just go with it there's a lot of lanyard
[25:37] if I needed my quota to see if you're a
[25:40] part of God then the only thing that
[25:44] could ever be a part of God would be the
[25:46] very nature and manifestation our person
[25:49] of himself how was it that Jesus was God
[25:54] I thought God Himself the great eternal
[26:04] that we've been preaching about
[26:06] condescended downward until he made in a
[26:12] flesh to come and live in and that that
[26:17] would be Almighty God the body would be
[26:22] a creation the acts of God's Word
[26:25] creating but the soul is a very soul of
[26:28] Almighty God the spirit was a very
[26:31] spirit of Almighty God placed in a man
[26:35] then the Bible said in him dwelt the
[26:38] fullness of the Godhead of course
[26:40] there's a lot of people now don't
[26:41] believe he was God until this happened
[26:42] or that happened or that happened with
[26:45] we've got time to argue folks I've been
[26:49] doing this 40 something years and all
[26:50] we've been doing is Argan we've been
[26:52] running around and around Horeb it's
[26:56] about time to believe what was what's
[26:58] been talk to us and get out of our own
[26:59] little sails and say thank you lord
[27:05] he's been that way if you have eternal
[27:09] life
[27:13] had to be a time that you received right
[27:16] so if you had a time to receive it that
[27:19] means you didn't have it start with if
[27:22] you if it come all the way down and and
[27:25] then all you need is a knowledge that's
[27:30] what I tried to tell those two sold
[27:31] people they were telling me about how
[27:32] that this over here said we just need to
[27:35] kill that I said why don't we just kill
[27:36] the individual you know if all you
[27:42] needed to destroy this soul is to kill
[27:44] that soul I said what if she did kill
[27:46] the individual he automatically goes to
[27:49] heaven them that don't come out too good
[27:54] does it see everybody's trying to bypass
[27:57] the simple simplicity of the new world
[28:01] and that was Jesus his first message was
[28:07] not the Nicodemus Nicodemus you realized
[28:10] who you are well he take him all the way
[28:13] through his lineages and everything I
[28:14] don't see he didn't say do you realize
[28:17] who you are in your eternal I just come
[28:22] to tell you your eternal then what kind
[28:25] of a gospel would that be see but the
[28:31] new birth is to receive the very person
[28:35] of Jesus Christ within you that is
[28:40] eternal life and if that's eternal life
[28:44] the eternal I've always loved eternal
[28:47] not you if we're going to get to that
[28:51] code when when it happened man fell from
[28:53] the original plan of God and it not been
[28:56] for the fall you could argue about your
[29:00] thoughts and ideas but you got admitted
[29:03] to fall and I sure hope to heaven that
[29:08] you don't think your eternal all the way
[29:12] through right now because and you do you
[29:16] forget it just take one look in the
[29:19] mirror and then look on the wall and see
[29:23] your picture when you was a little kid
[29:24] and see your picture now
[29:26] I think you'd find out if you're not
[29:28] that besides when you get up and get
[29:30] over them aches and pains and start
[29:32] popping in pills you know in trying to
[29:37] exist in a world and you think you're
[29:39] eternal Oh see that's the problem I
[29:42] swear we need our body is not eternal
[29:46] it's in the world of Satan's domain our
[29:50] spirit is in the reason memory
[29:53] consciousness and affections and think
[29:54] it's in that domain also and that's
[29:56] where Satan's working but the soul of
[29:59] the individual is born again has eternal
[30:02] life dwelling within that person that is
[30:06] the new birth or do you think we're
[30:08] going to have to wait - one of these
[30:09] days one of these days we're going to
[30:11] get a new birth
[30:14] well you got how something start live
[30:18] good at least you tell us what we got I
[30:21] know what you're doing with our face
[30:23] that we went to it they taught this
[30:27] message right here is turning it upside
[30:29] down and saying that's what you're
[30:32] saying
[30:33] no the Prophet told us what it was
[30:36] you're born again at faith the new birth
[30:40] you have eternal life in your soul and
[30:42] then you're beginning to take on the
[30:45] very nature of Almighty God right
[30:49] you understand what I'm driving out he
[30:54] said yeah but but I know the prophets
[30:57] message and I've studied it and listen
[30:59] well praise God just keep listening said
[31:02] he spends a lot of especially from 63 on
[31:06] to 65 he spends a lot talking about that
[31:09] you always was eternal that you come to
[31:12] this seed in you all of these things and
[31:17] talking about before the foundation of
[31:19] the world before the foundation of the
[31:28] world it's not just God's mind that he
[31:32] saw the things that's all you're doing
[31:36] with predestination
[31:37] that's the fatherís mankind has
[31:40] received in predestination you can argue
[31:44] that all you want to but you tell me
[31:46] about it you show me something this
[31:48] message preaching predestination I'll
[31:50] tell you just keep listening you're
[31:52] going to listen huh see but God look
[31:59] down and show all of this it is not
[32:03] God's plan and purpose to redeem all
[32:07] mankind you remember what we brought out
[32:11] when Steve what design he said God
[32:13] didn't come to redeem the devil's
[32:14] children well you're making a certain
[32:18] people out of no I'm not I'm doing what
[32:21] God says he's won it made it a certain
[32:23] people yeah but I thought we had to wait
[32:26] until we come down here and see that's
[32:28] true because if you don't receive it
[32:30] down here you wouldn't back down now if
[32:35] Jesus Christ had not have come and died
[32:37] on the cross that would have made all
[32:40] the Old Testament Scriptures void
[32:42] because every one of them pointed to him
[32:45] coming to die on the cross right it
[32:50] would have made it of no account to us
[32:54] but yet when he died there on Calvary
[32:57] that fulfilled all of those Old
[32:59] Testament Scriptures that brought all of
[33:02] that to life and brought an opportunity
[33:05] from Calvary an opportunity for a person
[33:10] to be able to receive eternal life into
[33:15] their soul you agree and see there's no
[33:22] other way to get eternal life except by
[33:24] him bringing it into you but come on
[33:29] then once you receive eternal life the
[33:31] eternal life always was eternal it
[33:40] always was eternal you know what I got
[33:44] this quote work let's see that's what
[33:45] you're doing you're killing yourself
[33:46] with the quotes instead of waiting upon
[33:49] the truth
[33:53] I mean come on down to your ages mankind
[33:57] tried to preach a new birth we might not
[33:59] have had it running in the order of
[34:01] Correction but we at least believed in
[34:03] it you come you talk to a good old bad
[34:07] especially the old ones I'm not making
[34:10] light of the way they say it but he said
[34:11] pretty strong they said you go to heaven
[34:14] you don't have to be born again you know
[34:19] what we don't do it now but you know
[34:23] what them old-timers would do they'd
[34:25] stand up over that body in it laying out
[34:27] there in front of it and says he never
[34:29] got burned again
[34:31] so he's in hell they didn't mind saying
[34:35] it like it was see we try to figure out
[34:38] live it out to give him a chance but
[34:42] come on church we walk to spaces like
[34:44] that
[34:44] I remember they're talking they didn't
[34:47] play games about it they believed you're
[34:50] either born again or you're not they
[34:52] didn't have a handshake in religion or
[34:54] joining the church come on you've heard
[34:58] the prophets say it he said we beat him
[35:00] in the back they come through something
[35:04] it wasn't just what I believe it
[35:07] as always was eternal something about me
[35:10] I just feel it shoulders Napoleone you
[35:12] know you remember the guy he's got it
[35:14] back there you know thought he existed
[35:17] before but listen Church I believe
[35:22] firmly emphatically and stayed it to you
[35:28] that the eternal life that you have in
[35:30] you if you have it now that's where your
[35:33] prophet always uses the word ill if you
[35:38] have eternal life you always was eternal
[35:42] what the eternal life not you I choose
[35:47] an individual don't you as a person as a
[35:49] being even we had to come into this
[35:54] world lost
[36:01] and how to receive eternal life I just
[36:04] believe the message not just say I
[36:07] accept the Jesus Christ so that was the
[36:10] one that really told me when are you
[36:12] missing he said I accepted Jesus Christ
[36:15] and I've listened one day the Prophet he
[36:16] said that's good well for you to accept
[36:19] Jesus Christ we said did he accept you
[36:23] you say I cried I prayed I got down and
[36:27] I done all this it's up to him to save
[36:29] me all right because you're cutting it
[36:31] off something's causing you not to
[36:35] continue on do you continue on until he
[36:40] accepts you oh you're making salvation
[36:46] on the basis of some kind of something
[36:48] master did I believe that's exactly
[36:50] right
[36:53] believing good you've got to have it
[37:00] with your Old Testament science believed
[37:02] ah why didn't they get born again we see
[37:10] I believe it was born again but it
[37:12] wasn't you might as well forget it cut
[37:14] it but listen do you see why it's so
[37:20] important to receive eternal life
[37:24] because if you don't receive eternal
[37:26] life you don't have eternal life that's
[37:29] plain sensible blunt I don't like you
[37:33] I'll go where I can understand it we'll
[37:36] go right ahead you're still going to
[37:38] face one time you've got to be born
[37:41] again but then that's what people can't
[37:46] follow see if you are born again but
[37:51] around I'm not talking about you as an
[37:52] individual he said not your being here
[37:55] he said but that was part of looking at
[37:58] laying here he said they was part a
[38:00] William Branham that was before the
[38:03] foundation of the world didn't he turn
[38:08] around saying not your being
[38:14] he said if you're part of God now you
[38:19] remember the quote we gave where the
[38:22] Prophet said that God has not going to
[38:23] or God's not complete without you do we
[38:26] believe that within evidently the new
[38:31] birth must be the life of God to come
[38:35] into us to make us his children within
[38:44] what would we worry back before the
[38:46] foundation of world what do you worry
[38:50] about what is this earth at it if you
[38:53] have eternal out now you prove what you
[38:55] would honor right is that sensible if
[39:01] you have eternal life now it proves you
[39:05] had eternal life before the world but
[39:11] sees what I've tried to get you to see
[39:14] we try to take predestination we try to
[39:17] take foreknowledge and we try to back up
[39:21] to a place and we try to use the quotes
[39:25] and the sayings of the Lamb
[39:27] you know the book of life of the Lamb we
[39:30] try to use those signs as trying to put
[39:32] it to a position but that's your
[39:35] stopping that's making God a picker in
[39:39] the chooser that means life is sold out
[39:42] before and then he chooses what he wants
[39:51] but you see what I've tried to get you
[39:53] to see for 40 something years is one
[39:55] time and I admit I didn't see it but I
[39:59] tried to preach it and I see it when I
[40:01] see something I'll preach up to it and I
[40:03] just leave it laying there when he picks
[40:07] it up and takes it all I'll preach on it
[40:10] but until he does I won't preach on it
[40:13] he because I know that you can get it
[40:18] all messed up but see eternal life is a
[40:23] person
[40:25] it is not a concept or a thought it's
[40:30] the actual person coming and living you
[40:33] will brother they're like I don't
[40:34] remember that I would maybe it didn't
[40:36] happen is it you said well you're making
[40:41] me lost come on I'm right here standing
[40:47] it and I said there's forty years ago
[40:49] when I say it today I wish to God I
[40:52] could preach it were that everybody in
[40:57] this building that was lost could come
[40:59] to salvation but you know what you can't
[41:02] come to it until you realize your loss
[41:06] until you realize you're lost Jesus
[41:09] Christ never done anything for you
[41:11] you've got a blanket throw that for
[41:14] mankind and that's what I'm trying to
[41:16] tell you you've got a predestination
[41:19] plan that is went back in and picked up
[41:22] with the Prophet had been able to to
[41:23] back up a lot of things we just remember
[41:32] you got him picking and choosing you got
[41:39] him looking down upon all mankind
[41:41] and figuring out and in your quote God
[41:45] knew I wanted to be saved so he had it
[41:48] for me well praise God that's true you
[41:52] know what I was the bad fish I could
[41:54] have said that cause it's true
[42:00] you see that's what I say
[42:02] your foreknowledge is your
[42:04] predestination is just dealing with the
[42:06] part of the mind of God that he would be
[42:09] able to see all things you're not
[42:14] opening up to the understanding that to
[42:18] look at him and let him not pick and
[42:21] choose you realize what I talking about
[42:25] Wednesday what I just quote it but you
[42:28] need them I'm going to lay in here where
[42:30] retron sitting we're a part of God he's
[42:35] not complete without us
[42:38] you realize then that part of you that's
[42:43] eternal was eternal before the world but
[42:51] there was a time you had to receive it
[42:56] good if you didn't receive it then
[43:01] you've missed it eternal life is a
[43:04] person it's not a concept or a thought
[43:07] that's what we've been taught all of our
[43:09] lives
[43:09] I accepted Jesus Christ I'm not the host
[43:12] of this and I believe this and I believe
[43:13] that and I know the Lord saved me and
[43:21] what about it Church where we chosen in
[43:27] him or chosen of him you're taking your
[43:33] predestination in your foreknowledge and
[43:36] going back into the mind of God and
[43:38] saying you were chosen of him and you're
[43:45] making it that there was something that
[43:47] you done or didn't do that had something
[43:49] to do with your salvation and how you're
[43:51] going to make it an unconditional
[43:52] covenant to Abraham and Abraham never
[43:54] even had the new birth that's something
[43:57] yet he had an unconditional covenant
[44:02] what about scriptures that we don't like
[44:05] to read God we don't understand what
[44:07] about it things that blessed is the man
[44:10] to whom God will not impute sin you mean
[44:17] there's somebody in the world of God
[44:18] won't impute sin a born-again believer
[44:22] because I'm quote the rest of it go to
[44:27] random said God will not impute sin over
[44:31] what the token well that means I can
[44:38] easily like the devil and do what I want
[44:39] to I've got a message on that that keeps
[44:42] coming back I put it parts in you
[44:46] realize that you remember a few weeks
[44:47] ago when I said it it just kept coming
[44:49] back and still coming
[44:51] you realize that if you think that there
[44:55] could be anything you could do or not do
[44:58] we make God save you then you're getting
[45:01] it on conditions and do you realize that
[45:05] if you think though as a Christian that
[45:10] you can do anything you want to and get
[45:14] by with it you're proving you are not a
[45:16] Christian that's not a Christian
[45:19] statement that's a devil statement for
[45:23] you to say I can just do anything I want
[45:25] to I'm a Christian that's coming from
[45:28] Satan that's not coming from God you
[45:33] remember what I've tried to explain to
[45:34] you so you say well will it don't matter
[45:38] what I done I don't little shady deal
[45:40] over here that's all right I'm a
[45:41] Christian I know I've been this without
[45:48] of the other but I believe I'm saved
[45:53] why would you think that would why would
[45:57] you ever have any thoughts that you
[46:00] could get by with anything I've tried my
[46:04] best to preach your truth to you it
[46:06] there's two judgments in the Bible right
[46:10] one of them is a watch on judgment
[46:12] you better not stand a tad you better be
[46:15] sitting on the judgment with him to
[46:16] judging right because the bride will be
[46:19] when you realize that your judgment of
[46:21] the deeds done in the body whether good
[46:22] or bad and you realize we're going to
[46:25] have to make a given account well it
[46:29] don't matter about me doing a little
[46:30] show your deal our daughter understands
[46:32] me I'm going to put it as plain as I can
[46:40] if we think that because we're
[46:43] Christians we can get by with anything
[46:47] then you realize what you're saying
[46:50] that is the worst sin that any person
[46:53] could ever commit married ten times
[46:57] living in adultery everything in the
[47:00] world you could that's nothing compared
[47:03] to
[47:04] you or me to think that we could get by
[47:07] because we're Christians heaven help you
[47:11] to think that your daddy and mama would
[47:13] even let you get by in the natural well
[47:17] I'm there to let me tell it is you're
[47:21] not a good child in you're a bastard
[47:25] born child this is not respecting your
[47:27] mother's and daddys you see when I get
[47:31] to that away I get hard I know it when
[47:33] you realize if you think you're getting
[47:35] by or something there's going to be a
[47:38] reckoning day and for heaven's sake
[47:42] don't think this way well I know there's
[47:45] going to be a reckoning day but I'll
[47:46] still make it I've made my statement
[47:50] years ago I'll still keep making it I am
[47:54] NOT d Christianizing nobody called we're
[47:57] all sinners saved by grace I don't de
[48:00] Christian I have nobody but you realize
[48:03] that there are things in our lives that
[48:06] if we're not straight and living it
[48:08] right we are going to the grave now
[48:15] don't tell me we're going to walk off us
[48:17] earth in the rapture when our lives
[48:21] don't line up to a good Christian now
[48:24] using this song all you want to he said
[48:29] well I I just cut a little bit of a
[48:31] higher I can get by that cause nobody
[48:33] don't see it I know one sitting here she
[48:36] don't mind me saying I've heard you ever
[48:39] heard women talk about iron in their
[48:41] heart you know what you do when you iron
[48:43] you higher you burn off the ends but
[48:47] that's as good as cutting come on
[48:50] so you brother Dale shrub I need let's
[48:55] see we don't get by with him time you
[49:00] see what I put on just a little bit of
[49:02] makeup
[49:06] just a little bit you're not going in a
[49:12] change of the body wearing makeup
[49:15] I need Christianizing hit going into
[49:23] hell never heard enough so we're all
[49:25] human you know what that means that
[49:27] means what God told me years ago to be
[49:29] the truth he said the biggest portion of
[49:35] people of this message and he was
[49:38] referring to people of this message and
[49:40] I put it in the category that he was
[49:42] referring even to Christians
[49:43] he said they're going to die and go by
[49:45] the grave because they'll not be able to
[49:49] take the change you think I'm pointing
[49:52] to someone that's died of your family or
[49:54] this without a deal you're wrong I'm
[49:57] pointing to every one of us old age is
[50:03] taking some health takes on death take
[50:05] some that ain't got to do what I'm
[50:08] talking about you ain't listening that
[50:14] you see anything we think we can get by
[50:16] with because we're a Christian we're
[50:22] going by the grave but somebody's going
[50:28] to stand here one day and be changed
[50:32] you know what it ain't going to be no
[50:34] good person cuz they ain't no good
[50:37] person there's going to be somebody
[50:40] that's trying somebody that's repentant
[50:48] what did God choose David and say David
[50:53] was a man after his own heart
[50:54] how long have you only stand here talk
[50:56] about he was adulterous he was a
[50:58] murderer he was a whoremonger he would
[51:00] all the things in the world
[51:02] David was but yet God said he was a man
[51:05] after his own heart you mean God like so
[51:07] signs all the difference in David's
[51:10] heart and mankind he had an honest and a
[51:15] contrite heart he repented even Scofield
[51:19] knows it
[51:20] but a random will tell you Scofield you
[51:22] read it where David is on his way home
[51:25] from the bed of that Sheba and said
[51:27] that's when he cries out return unto me
[51:28] the joy of thy salvation even caught
[51:31] that as a scholar I'm not trying to
[51:37] decrease you not nobody if you die and
[51:41] go by the grave that just means one
[51:42] thing for certain you're going to beat
[51:46] me up and raise before I change I'm not
[51:50] trying to decrease United I'm trying to
[51:52] make it straight so you lose the point
[51:57] the point is what if we're trying to
[51:59] make it by some other way then to the
[52:01] blood of Jesus Christ then we're lost to
[52:03] start with if we say we always was
[52:06] eternal if we cause we got a quote from
[52:10] brother Branham you see you you be
[52:16] careful cause we talking about a prophet
[52:18] I've been over and over and over it I'll
[52:21] be glad to face him with everything he
[52:23] said because the same Holy Spirit that
[52:26] said it through him I believe is the
[52:28] same Holy Spirit is saying right now the
[52:32] eternal life that you have in your soul
[52:34] always was eternal but there was a time
[52:38] you didn't have it and I didn't have it
[52:41] there was a time your prophet had to get
[52:45] a new birth and see that's why you can
[52:50] tie together then all the Old Testament
[52:53] is waiting on this day without us cannot
[52:57] be made perfect see then there's some
[53:00] here is waiting line because we got to
[53:04] come to that place to understand who we
[53:06] are do you realize what I'm talking
[53:08] about see that should make everything as
[53:12] you listen to a tape and you hear
[53:14] brother Branham say you always was
[53:16] eternal you come with a scene in your
[53:18] dollar hey man I now know what happened
[53:24] because I used to think that I didn't
[53:29] have to worry about nothing I can't
[53:32] believe the message
[53:35] but now no one realizes based on whether
[53:38] or not I received eternal life and I
[53:44] don't care who you are who we are whose
[53:45] was if you don't receive eternal life
[53:48] you don't have it we'll get to it
[53:54] there's only one man in the Bible that
[53:57] God had parted a man and a wife he
[54:02] imparted eternal life to Adam and Eve
[54:07] we've been through the blasphemous names
[54:11] and read it he's never done that after
[54:16] then why because they fell from that
[54:18] place not the eternal lost they fell to
[54:23] death because you can't have an eternal
[54:27] sinner even your Bible plainly tells you
[54:30] if you read it
[54:31] it talks about how that he's had got to
[54:33] put them out last day for take of the
[54:35] Tree of Life and watch and live forever
[54:38] he didn't say protect to the tree life
[54:40] and live eternal though there's no way
[54:42] to protect the tree I mean the tree of
[54:44] death
[54:44] there's no way to protect the tree of
[54:45] death and live forever that's what's
[54:48] killing us you got to have the Tree of
[54:51] Life the Tree of Life is the Word of God
[54:55] you see that's why we're trying our best
[54:57] to bring it to you because he it were
[55:00] chosen in him remember I brought it
[55:03] right at the end Wednesday chosen in him
[55:05] not just chosen I am that goes into the
[55:11] whole line of predestination and you
[55:16] know that we're just chosen of him or
[55:18] like that Jim by him choosing us out as
[55:22] an individual
[55:23] he's a per here is a showing respect to
[55:27] person but if we were chosen in him now
[55:32] the Bible should come alive you realize
[55:37] he died as a lamb slain before the
[55:42] foundation of the world right
[55:45] is that true and the book on the life of
[55:49] the lamb remember I was just reading it
[55:52] oh good
[55:53] Judas his name was in the book a lot but
[55:55] removed but he said it was not in the
[55:58] eternal section so there's a section of
[56:01] the book of life the Bible that is
[56:04] talking about eternal life but there's a
[56:07] section of it this is talking about life
[56:10] there's pre destinations there's where
[56:13] you mankind as far as he's went with
[56:14] predestination is to book of life we
[56:18] think we understand I'm talking about
[56:22] God in his offspring come on give me a
[56:24] just a minute to that God and his
[56:27] offspring you you think that you're our
[56:30] child of God by the new birth come on
[56:34] I'm not actually raise your hand I'm
[56:35] asking raise your heart you realize by
[56:38] being a born-again Christian that that
[56:41] means that life within you is a part of
[56:44] Almighty God if it's a part of Almighty
[56:49] God then God living in you you realize
[56:56] then before the world ever begun God had
[56:59] his attributes have we been through long
[57:01] enough now in the message but six or
[57:06] seven sermons dealing specifically on
[57:08] that you remember Wednesday night when I
[57:14] brought it because it was one of this
[57:16] kind of held a little bit because we
[57:19] should talk about these attributes is
[57:22] being father but he had an attribute to
[57:26] be a son
[57:27] you remember that Winston I just kind of
[57:31] held out a little bit for you to think a
[57:33] tribute to be a son well Shawn's gotta
[57:38] forget that Sunday now no beginning now
[57:45] I want to ask you a question see if you
[57:46] put it in your mind and think about your
[57:49] born-again Christian aren't you what did
[57:52] you have a beginning the born-again part
[57:56] it but you yourself had to have a
[57:58] beginning that's why you're called a son
[58:02] of God
[58:04] realizing then you say well what I'm
[58:07] trying my best to preach it to you folks
[58:09] and notice I cry and praying for some
[58:12] way I've tried to get you back into
[58:15] God's mind enough to go back to work
[58:17] that you would go back to the point that
[58:19] we could realize that God was real that
[58:22] not just he's the spirit he's just this
[58:25] out of the other God was real
[58:27] he lived in a real world before this
[58:29] thing ever started before he started
[58:32] anything this way he was already tired
[58:38] and he built a man you remember that
[58:42] what was God's plan and purpose were to
[58:45] build a man in his own image he did
[58:48] Genesis 1:26 and 27
[58:51] he built a man in his own image you
[58:57] realized then by building the man in his
[58:59] own image in His image with what he was
[59:01] he said well what does God look like
[59:04] does he look like this we look like that
[59:05] oh I don't know what he looks like
[59:06] within if he made us in his info but
[59:08] that's not this out here but that that
[59:12] inside man will praise God for the
[59:15] inside man but you know the outside man
[59:22] you think it's not in the image of God
[59:28] may I quote it this way so if you make
[59:31] sure you keep it right become in our
[59:35] image our likeness right cool
[59:44] you've got your animals of creations
[59:46] coming down then you got man created and
[59:48] you got God coming in our image just
[59:50] like us right
[59:52] he had just what we got he looked just
[59:54] like we did you know what that must have
[59:57] been evidently what he wanted to start
[59:59] with I thought we believed that he
[1:00:05] wanted and here's where we use it to
[1:00:07] that point we say he wanted us to be
[1:00:10] where he could have fellowship with us
[1:00:13] now what does that mean give me a second
[1:00:17] what does it mean to how fellowship now
[1:00:23] you can out fellowship with one another
[1:00:24] you can talk to one huh what is supposed
[1:00:26] to be your real fellowship you're in
[1:00:29] your offspring right I sure don't close
[1:00:34] your mind will maybe she'll fall 10
[1:00:36] don't worry about it don't blame the
[1:00:37] other part of it must I'm sorry I mean I
[1:00:41] guess you know we see we blame the other
[1:00:44] side there's always two sides you can go
[1:00:48] to town and buy meat and it's so thin
[1:00:50] until I put ten pieces of meat on my my
[1:00:53] sandwich to eat coat is so thin I can't
[1:00:57] even find it between my teeth but you
[1:00:59] know why I still got two sides you blame
[1:01:08] everybody else instead of blaming
[1:01:09] yourself maybe your children don't want
[1:01:12] this message because they don't like you
[1:01:14] and your ways of expressing it now you
[1:01:18] shouldn't leave that way brother Dale is
[1:01:21] it true or not like I told them here go
[1:01:27] down and watch them every one of them
[1:01:29] fall bushes won't like this and everyone
[1:01:33] have them bend over every one of them
[1:01:38] Dale the only one that stand up straight
[1:01:40] I don't know where he caught her done
[1:01:41] but she watching Dale standing for the
[1:01:43] straight you know look you know why
[1:01:46] because Tom walk like that and they walk
[1:01:51] like her daddy
[1:01:54] listen church
[1:01:56] I'm simply trying to get one point to
[1:01:58] you we think we understand
[1:02:00] predestination and we think we go back
[1:02:02] to $4 and done but what about going on
[1:02:04] back into the very mind of God to
[1:02:06] realize if we are the children of God if
[1:02:10] we have eternal life that eternal life
[1:02:13] we have always was eternal and that's
[1:02:18] his children
[1:02:20] that's his offspring she didn't he ain't
[1:02:28] picking and choosing that's where you
[1:02:31] don't get predestination is so wonderful
[1:02:38] we talked about he don't pick and choose
[1:02:47] but he does pick and choose in the
[1:02:51] natural life of mankind according the
[1:02:53] way they live and go right
[1:02:56] oh we go with Jacob how I love day
[1:03:01] before either one I've ever done either
[1:03:02] you think he didn't know what Jacob
[1:03:04] wanted we're doing what I saw with you
[1:03:07] you realize that as far as we go with
[1:03:10] our predestination said I want to get
[1:03:14] this to a close
[1:03:15] chosen in him when he before the world
[1:03:22] stood as a lamb slain your name was
[1:03:26] written in the book of life from he's
[1:03:34] far
[1:03:34] God is concerned I'll quote brother
[1:03:37] branham I go to laying in understudy
[1:03:38] large brother Brian as God is concerned
[1:03:42] ever born again person was already saved
[1:03:45] right every person that would ever be
[1:03:49] saved or saved right there because your
[1:03:51] name was written there are left out see
[1:03:55] then if you try to deal with some way of
[1:03:57] getting your name written into the book
[1:04:00] as far as your going to go is a
[1:04:02] predestination or situation and you're
[1:04:05] not going back to be part of God you
[1:04:11] realize that the DNA they can do it with
[1:04:13] the mother or the father either one you
[1:04:14] realize your DNA can be run all the way
[1:04:16] back we see here is what gets me with
[1:04:20] the people of the message in the way
[1:04:21] they think look let's go don't you tell
[1:04:24] me I'm serpent seed it wouldn't make
[1:04:26] better difference if I could run my DNA
[1:04:29] and go every bit of it would go back to
[1:04:32] that beast that was standing in the
[1:04:35] garden and inject it into the human race
[1:04:42] this would not bother me one bit that
[1:04:48] would make me glory and say hallelujah
[1:04:50] he could save something like that
[1:04:55] because see that's not what you're
[1:04:57] talking about
[1:05:01] see that's what everybody wants to talk
[1:05:03] about they get all of these things
[1:05:05] involved with us we were talking about
[1:05:07] it the other day while you got Judah and
[1:05:12] Tamar in the Bible oh I've heard the
[1:05:17] people this message preached that the
[1:05:19] only women it was right to do this the
[1:05:21] only one rights come on the lineage
[1:05:26] coming down to Jesus Christ comes right
[1:05:29] through David from Bathsheba which was
[1:05:34] playing out adultery or getting two
[1:05:37] things Judah and Tamar she tricked him
[1:05:40] but it was playing adultery but that
[1:05:43] only carried the natural lineage
[1:05:47] that was not a spiritual lineage
[1:05:50] you can't bring a spiritual lineage
[1:05:53] through David and Bathsheba I'll quote
[1:05:59] you bread around you know that bread
[1:06:01] around said Bathsheba was made for David
[1:06:03] he won't that one don't try to get into
[1:06:07] marriage and divorce with me about it
[1:06:08] because it ain't going to work because
[1:06:09] I'm on quarter water scripturally and
[1:06:11] tell you you and I don't understand so
[1:06:16] we just leave it alone I got my straight
[1:06:19] line and appreciate but I've got things
[1:06:23] in there the back seat when David is
[1:06:25] sticking unto her and not straight from
[1:06:27] there but you know what tickles me to
[1:06:28] death it tickled me to death to say this
[1:06:33] when I was in the Baptist Church
[1:06:35] I knew the lineage never went to Mary
[1:06:42] there's no lineage going to marry women
[1:06:48] are not encountered in the lineage
[1:06:49] there's no lineage there's no way to get
[1:06:51] one the lineage goes to Joseph what was
[1:06:54] Joseph the daddy of Jesus no but if he
[1:07:01] had to protected her they wouldn't have
[1:07:06] been no Jesus but you see we think that
[1:07:10] well listen no it's time to get down to
[1:07:13] understanding but what are you talking
[1:07:16] about I'm talking about that it
[1:07:18] born-again experience you have making
[1:07:21] you a part of God was a part of God
[1:07:23] before the world ever begun and a part
[1:07:25] of God before he ever you started
[1:07:27] thinking about what this world was going
[1:07:29] to be like that's what I believe about
[1:07:31] eternal life then you can see that hey I
[1:07:38] believe in eternal life the life that he
[1:07:44] had has got to be transmitted into you
[1:07:46] and me to give us a new birth now the
[1:07:50] new birth that we have always was
[1:07:52] eternal well it what it is it obviously
[1:07:58] are you saying we just come to a
[1:07:59] knowledge No
[1:08:01] I've never talked something like that I
[1:08:03] told it to start with on this message
[1:08:05] that's wrong to think you just coming to
[1:08:07] a knowledge of something knowledge
[1:08:10] puffeth out remember but when you come
[1:08:14] to a realization or a revelation you
[1:08:18] realize then how eternal eternity really
[1:08:21] is but you're making us part of God I
[1:08:25] didn't make us part of God he made us
[1:08:27] part of him when he come up with the
[1:08:33] point did he had attributes within him
[1:08:35] and one of those attributes was to be a
[1:08:37] son now we're going to take that son and
[1:08:44] start the creation of the world then
[1:08:46] you'll see why we read John's much that
[1:08:51] son remember that son was the word
[1:08:57] remember that son was internal that son
[1:09:02] never had a beginning yeah but he's a
[1:09:04] son that's just terms that's words when
[1:09:11] God stepped over in another form and
[1:09:13] became the word it was not another god
[1:09:17] it was the same God you agree loving you
[1:09:24] shaking your head you saying okay you
[1:09:25] agree now let's see if you agree with
[1:09:27] the rest of it when he stepped over into
[1:09:31] and became even into human flesh he was
[1:09:34] Almighty God you believe that be careful
[1:09:39] shaking your head because you know I'm
[1:09:41] going to say something what about when
[1:09:43] he stepped over into you what about when
[1:09:49] he stepped over into you he makes you a
[1:09:54] child of God a son of God a daughter of
[1:09:57] God why because the life is see that
[1:10:01] it's not a second person will go back to
[1:10:03] thee when he comes from father down to
[1:10:07] son to create it's not a second person
[1:10:09] it's the same person in another form
[1:10:13] now if God is not complete without you
[1:10:17] then evidently on the day of Pentecost
[1:10:21] he stepped over into a people that he
[1:10:24] could not step into any old testament
[1:10:26] why because there was no way made what
[1:10:32] about eternal life then the eternal life
[1:10:35] I have always was eternal
[1:10:39] the seed of God was in me where did the
[1:10:43] Prophet say it we give it Wednesday
[1:10:44] what'd he say
[1:10:45] he said the seed was put in you before
[1:10:47] the foundation of the world
[1:10:48] now you're going to argue with him okay
[1:10:51] but you're going to say you don't
[1:10:52] believe the way brother Dale's
[1:10:53] presenting well I'm trying to present it
[1:10:56] what he said he said the seed was
[1:10:58] putting us before the foundation of the
[1:10:59] world
[1:11:01] now what part of us here's the point
[1:11:05] what part of us was before the
[1:11:06] foundation world not this body not a
[1:11:12] spirit or soul called Samuel Dale cause
[1:11:16] in you and have total pre existences
[1:11:19] what part where would that seed put
[1:11:25] before the foundation of the world we've
[1:11:31] put in Jesus Christ to become all and
[1:11:34] all is that Scripture
[1:11:37] it is all in all when Jesus Christ I'm
[1:11:41] saying Jesus Christ not the flesh
[1:11:42] because he that's reason I keep saying
[1:11:44] it so somebody come along brother Dave
[1:11:46] Jesus Christ no Jesus the flesh never
[1:11:48] created nothing Jesus the flesh didn't
[1:11:51] exist before the world but Jesus the
[1:11:54] Christ Jesus the Almighty God the Great
[1:11:58] Eternal Father except over into flesh to
[1:12:05] die that that life could be released
[1:12:08] right back out of that because that body
[1:12:11] wouldn't eternal anything's not eternal
[1:12:14] got to be redeemed
[1:12:17] are you listening then what part of you
[1:12:25] laying our bread around said said there
[1:12:27] was some part of William Branham back
[1:12:29] before the foundation of the world you
[1:12:36] see ever born-again believer some part
[1:12:40] of you was before the foundation the
[1:12:42] world because we're not just getting
[1:12:44] eternal life in a white throne remember
[1:12:46] he didn't come to save the devil's
[1:12:49] children the devil's children now you're
[1:12:52] going to listen for a second the devil's
[1:12:54] children you and I were right in the
[1:12:58] middle of that situation oh no we got
[1:13:03] this sowing of the seed and we got the
[1:13:06] devil so in this part all of us were
[1:13:10] seen as the devil all of us needed to
[1:13:13] redeem her if we didn't need a redeemer
[1:13:14] what do we need to remember for if we
[1:13:16] didn't need it see that gets to where I
[1:13:20] know I don't have enough time to bring
[1:13:22] out what I'm talking about and I'll
[1:13:23] leave you dangling I'm sorry what I try
[1:13:26] to make it as plain as I can
[1:13:27] I believe the minute you come to the
[1:13:32] altar brother Brennan said you receive
[1:13:34] eternal life right there an altar well
[1:13:37] then what do you need eternal life in
[1:13:38] the altar if you already had it is that
[1:13:43] sensible if you already had it what do
[1:13:46] you need to receive it because it's the
[1:13:51] fact that we didn't have it Jesus Christ
[1:13:55] according to my Bibles to the lamb slain
[1:13:57] before the foundation of the world you
[1:13:59] know what he done that 2,000 years ago
[1:14:02] to make it a reality
[1:14:05] you realize before the foundation of the
[1:14:08] world he looked down and saw his
[1:14:12] children and brought around said days a
[1:14:15] word or seed forever age so that means
[1:14:18] he spread it out over the ages to bring
[1:14:22] his children you realize those children
[1:14:25] are just as eternal as our Father but
[1:14:29] it's got to be transmitted to earth to
[1:14:32] where we can receive it
[1:14:34] because you see whether you believe it
[1:14:36] or not my Serena keep emphasizing it
[1:14:40] Adam stood in the Garden of Eden with
[1:14:44] eternal life in your soul your prophet
[1:14:46] said it with his body and his spirit was
[1:14:49] lost I don't mean lost like that God
[1:14:54] hadn't been allowed at that time but it
[1:14:56] was not eternal that's the part he could
[1:15:00] fall in his body and his spirit mainly
[1:15:03] new spirit we would lead into his body
[1:15:05] for the body dis this place will you
[1:15:09] realize that if we did everyone been
[1:15:12] brought that would away we'd had come
[1:15:16] we'd come like Adam but there's got to
[1:15:23] be the other attributes and the thoughts
[1:15:24] and the things we've got to be displayed
[1:15:26] so he allowed us to come but he knew the
[1:15:32] minute you'd receive eternal life he
[1:15:36] assigns you an angel according to your
[1:15:38] prophet was a angels according to the
[1:15:40] Bible a ministry experience made to be
[1:15:42] for the servant the children of God or
[1:15:44] that his offspring he was right there to
[1:15:50] make sure you come to the right place
[1:15:54] but then one day you had to come to that
[1:15:56] place you had to receive eternal life
[1:16:01] now God's plan is perfect well what if
[1:16:09] they hadn't have been are seen in the
[1:16:10] garden now there's no way to say they
[1:16:13] wouldn't because they already had the
[1:16:14] tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life
[1:16:17] he knew it was going to be that way but
[1:16:19] what if they hadn't have been a fall you
[1:16:21] realize all God had to do was create a
[1:16:23] body and he could just drop down in
[1:16:28] eternal life into the soul and there you
[1:16:32] would stand there you realize when we
[1:16:34] all come forth and everything was
[1:16:36] finished we go to the Tree of Life and /
[1:16:39] take of the Tree of Life in these bodies
[1:16:41] would be made eternal
[1:16:46] we know it wasn't going to happen but
[1:16:47] are you understanding me what if it
[1:16:49] didn't happen you realize it did happen
[1:16:53] because you come in the world lost with
[1:16:57] a day you accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:16:59] Savior he come to live in you to bring
[1:17:02] forth that predestinated plan into you
[1:17:05] and you didn't do it for the devil
[1:17:06] children everybody won't have it
[1:17:10] becoming stepped inside of you I thought
[1:17:15] that this Bible was the Tree of Life I
[1:17:24] thought this Bible was the Tree of Life
[1:17:26] I thought we were eating this
[1:17:30] I thought your prophet said we've become
[1:17:34] the word as we received one heard not
[1:17:37] letters on a page with quickened
[1:17:39] revelation in her heart nothing didn't
[1:17:45] change God's getting this predestinated
[1:17:49] plan just exactly but there's a lot of
[1:17:52] people going to be in heaven that had
[1:17:58] nothing to do with salvation he's gonna
[1:18:03] impart eternal life to a lot of people
[1:18:05] because they just was good to you maybe
[1:18:10] the eternal life is different than just
[1:18:14] a thought now listen to what I'm saying
[1:18:18] and those who receive eternal life at
[1:18:22] the white throne not a one of them will
[1:18:26] be the children of God they will just be
[1:18:31] an impartation right but you know why
[1:18:38] they're going to be an impartation
[1:18:39] because you fail and by you falling it
[1:18:44] gives them a change so you know what
[1:18:48] they are going to look up to us and say
[1:18:50] thank you for coming come on
[1:18:57] think on these things I'm trying my best
[1:19:04] to explain that before the world the
[1:19:07] only thing that existed was God himself
[1:19:11] but at that time we were there in him
[1:19:18] waiting the time to come into human
[1:19:21] flesh and to fulfill the rest of his
[1:19:26] plan and purpose with mankind so don't
[1:19:29] stop your doctrine and thoughts of
[1:19:32] predestination and only go back and
[1:19:35] stand in heaven in God's mind try your
[1:19:43] best to understand that if God did have
[1:19:49] a mind and thought about it
[1:19:50] the party was thinking with is him and
[1:19:57] eternal life you have now is a very part
[1:20:01] of Almighty God don't make no difference
[1:20:07] about the rest well if I predestinated
[1:20:12] appease our Aaron goes back to what I
[1:20:14] say and want to go that we think that
[1:20:18] we're Christians we can just get by with
[1:20:20] any time remember not don't do it
[1:20:24] wouldn't it be horrible to realize one
[1:20:28] day that you turn down the opportunity
[1:20:33] to come to a change of the body because
[1:20:39] you would not be sincere enough as a
[1:20:43] Christian we were talking yesterday and
[1:20:46] every day we're working in really

[1:26:52] be born again to receive that eternal
[1:26:53] out but once that eternal life comes
