[15:58] and also for the uh i hope we can start
[16:00] getting the youth back together and like
[16:02] brother dale said we
[16:04] at least i'd like to get the sunday
[16:05] school back for the little kids because
[16:06] they need it and the little kids are a
[16:08] little less susceptible than
[16:10] we are for this
[16:12] um whatever you want to call it virus
[16:15] so
[16:16] we just be diligent everybody remember
[16:18] do what we say wear masks
[16:22] and then fellowship downstairs with the
[16:24] whole i think we're i think we're all
[16:26] pretty much 99 100 of us are doing it so
[16:29] um
[16:30] we appreciate that now i want to today
[16:34] we're speaking on eternal redemption and
[16:36] i've been thinking this week
[16:38] i've got several things laid out here
[16:40] and some more quotes over there and i
[16:42] added one so you know how that goes
[16:44] but
[16:45] before we get into our
[16:48] chart that
[16:49] most of you have and we'll put we'll
[16:50] bring it up here
[16:52] um
[16:53] we need to cover something because
[16:54] listen
[16:57] we know as well as anybody
[17:00] in the world
[17:01] that the bible
[17:03] is like an onion peel
[17:05] it's real thin layers and you can just
[17:08] keep pulling the layers back because
[17:09] it's eternal right
[17:11] and then we have a prophet of god that
[17:13] came to make that more plain
[17:16] amen
[17:17] make that more plain not confusing
[17:20] make that more plain and he was a what a
[17:23] bible prophet
[17:24] this is going to be real important in a
[17:26] few minutes because i if you don't say
[17:28] yeah then you're going to be in trouble
[17:30] he was a word prophet he could say
[17:32] nothing
[17:34] outside of what the word said he didn't
[17:36] bring his own bible
[17:38] he didn't make his own revelation
[17:40] but i'll tell you what though you got to
[17:42] remember
[17:44] the prophet of god tells us and that's
[17:46] the way i read my bible as a love letter
[17:48] you've heard me many times tell you that
[17:49] if you don't get the essence of this
[17:51] message and the essence of this bible
[17:54] you're going to miss it because if i've
[17:55] got quotes sitting right in there that
[17:57] eternal life came at the altar i've got
[18:00] quotes right here that eternal life was
[18:01] before the foundation of the world
[18:02] brother brown's not that confused
[18:05] we are the ones that are confused
[18:08] he's not he was showing us something but
[18:11] you're going to have to onion peel this
[18:13] thing and see when he's talking about
[18:15] the mind of god and what he's talking
[18:17] about down here because
[18:19] verily verily i say unto you this ain't
[18:21] the this ain't the perfect will of god
[18:26] this is the permissive will of god
[18:28] working into the perfect will of god
[18:31] everybody got that say amen
[18:33] because listen close your eyes just for
[18:35] a second
[18:36] everybody close their eyes
[18:38] you got 30 seconds to think about your
[18:40] life from a baby to right now and when
[18:43] you open your eyes
[18:45] i want you to raise your hand
[18:49] if you've never had a bad thought
[18:51] never say anything bad about somebody
[18:54] never done something wrong
[18:58] you can go and bring open your eyes now
[19:00] because you better not put your hand up
[19:01] because that makes you a liar
[19:03] brother chris has got his hand down this
[19:05] way he said he was down there
[19:08] so now did anybody come here
[19:10] perfect
[19:12] no
[19:14] by the transforming power of god we
[19:16] become perfect
[19:18] but not in this
[19:20] that's right
[19:21] but remember the mind of god can't
[19:23] change
[19:24] everybody got that
[19:26] mind of god can't change he can't say
[19:28] well you know i thought of samuel dale
[19:30] but now when he got down here he started
[19:31] just being a rascal a dog and i ain't
[19:33] gonna have nothing to do with no
[19:37] what have we been reading about this is
[19:38] before the foundation of the world right
[19:41] this thing was done settled signed and
[19:43] delivered the lamb was slain before the
[19:45] foundation of the world
[19:47] so why does the prophet say that your
[19:49] eternal life began at the altar i got
[19:50] the quote right here
[19:56] life begins at the altar
[19:58] eternal life when you come to jesus
[20:00] christ
[20:02] then i got one right here from the
[20:03] smyrna church age that says you did not
[20:04] become seed by the rebirth you were seed
[20:07] and therefore were reborn there's your
[20:09] difference
[20:11] you were reborn there has to be an
[20:13] action amen
[20:16] or jesus could have looked in nicodemus
[20:18] and said nicodemus you always was
[20:20] eternal you just one of us no he wasn't
[20:23] he wasn't in the eternal mind of god
[20:25] because he never became a seed of god
[20:28] now he'll be given eternal life that's
[20:30] not seed of god
[20:32] and remember when i talk about seed
[20:34] today i'm going to write it right up
[20:35] here in the corner what is seed
[20:37] seed's not what you're planting the
[20:39] ground talking about god
[20:42] seed is the word
[20:44] god has no natural
[20:46] germ sperm no seed as far as we see
[20:49] because i know when some of you when
[20:50] somebody preaches on seed that's the
[20:52] first thing you think about it's
[20:53] planting something
[20:57] god didn't have to plant one thing in
[20:58] the garden of eden it was there because
[21:00] of what
[21:02] spoken word of god
[21:04] i like what brother chris said he said
[21:06] you know the first action wasn't the
[21:07] creation
[21:10] god said
[21:12] god said the first thing was the spoken
[21:14] word and then the creation happened
[21:17] so in genesis 1 26 when he said let us
[21:21] make man in our own image there we were
[21:24] but it wasn't every seed that come on
[21:27] the face of the earth
[21:30] it was only the seed of god the word of
[21:33] god
[21:34] we were in him before the foundation of
[21:36] the world
[21:38] but the problem is like we're going to
[21:39] look on our timeline something happened
[21:41] and pushed us down here into time but
[21:44] it's working us because redemption means
[21:46] what to bring back or purchase back
[21:47] we'll read that in just a second so put
[21:49] those things in your mind
[21:52] and come to me and tell me you were born
[21:54] right and i'll tell you you're a liar
[21:56] according to the bible
[22:00] nothing good
[22:03] nothing
[22:05] you were born wrong
[22:07] you come to this world lying
[22:09] stealing
[22:11] contrary to god
[22:13] but now that didn't change the mind
[22:17] didn't change that none what bit didn't
[22:18] change the mind of god one bit you
[22:20] always were there
[22:22] if you were there you'll always be there
[22:24] he can't add you to it
[22:28] but he can't take you away from it
[22:29] either amen so hebrews 9 verse 11
[22:33] because we're going to have to cover
[22:34] that because when we read the prophet's
[22:35] message and we see these things that
[22:38] people say seems to be contrary
[22:40] or or you know somebody will just bring
[22:42] you a quote and go here no bring me the
[22:44] whole picture
[22:47] i can pick this message apart with one
[22:49] quote at a time
[22:52] this bible today is being picked apart
[22:56] one verse at a time
[22:58] by contrary preaching out there
[23:01] and even here if you say
[23:03] so hebrews 9 11
[23:05] says but
[23:07] christ being coming high priest of good
[23:08] things to come by a greater and more
[23:10] perfect tabernacle from brother dale's
[23:12] talk about this morning not made with
[23:14] hands that is to say not of this
[23:15] building neither by the blood of bulls
[23:17] and goats or calves but by his own blood
[23:20] he entered in once into the holy place
[23:22] having obtained
[23:24] eternal redemption
[23:26] for us let's bow our heads just for a
[23:28] moment lord
[23:30] you know we've been thinking about this
[23:31] for days
[23:33] running it over in our mind
[23:35] and
[23:37] seems like this is the way to go lord
[23:39] that we were looking at last night and i
[23:41] pray lord that you would just
[23:43] anoint our lips
[23:44] you do the speaking
[23:46] i know for a fact
[23:49] the prophet of god stood here and
[23:50] brought us the perfect word of god yet
[23:52] people turned him down
[23:54] so you're the only one that can do the
[23:56] revealing
[23:57] you're the only one that can go way down
[24:00] into that soul of that individual
[24:03] and change us lord
[24:05] and make us right and lord for us to be
[24:08] in this end time you require that we
[24:11] come to adoption that we come to full
[24:13] headship
[24:15] so you've made a way lord
[24:17] you promised you'd do it you said you'd
[24:19] do it and you said through the
[24:20] foolishness of preaching this is the way
[24:22] it's going to be
[24:23] and lord i pray that you would bless us
[24:25] keep us
[24:26] take care of us
[24:27] be with the ones that are sick lord the
[24:28] ones that are on the highways brother
[24:30] bob and him on the way back lord there
[24:31] from sweetwater and brother lewis and
[24:33] them down in atlanta lord we pray that
[24:35] you'd bring them back together
[24:37] together in one father in jesus name we
[24:40] ask these things
[24:41] amen
[24:42] obtain you can be seated having obtained
[24:45] eternal redemption for us so see he had
[24:48] to obtain something he didn't come here
[24:50] eternal
[24:51] in his body
[24:53] hello
[24:54] he didn't come here eternally in his
[24:56] body right
[24:57] but yet he came eternal from the god
[24:59] from god he was god no less god no more
[25:02] god right
[25:03] but you and i didn't come the way he
[25:05] came
[25:06] we can't be the fullness that one as one
[25:08] person but as a collective body we can
[25:11] be one amen the fullness of the godhead
[25:13] bodily
[25:14] and then in the end time the bride must
[25:16] be
[25:17] the fullness so now let's look at the
[25:19] greek lexicon and see what it says about
[25:21] redemption we've been talking about
[25:22] eternal redemption and i didn't bring
[25:24] this last week but look redemption means
[25:26] what deliverance
[25:28] a releasing affected by payment because
[25:32] remember it
[25:33] had there had to be a payment
[25:37] boaz had to stand up and take his shoe
[25:39] off
[25:41] and say i will
[25:43] because there's no way naomi could do
[25:45] that right
[25:46] she was caught she was trapped
[25:49] amen right somebody had to stand forth a
[25:51] kinsman had to redeem and what did he
[25:54] what did he say he didn't say i'll take
[25:57] all the roofs or know amy stuff and i'm
[25:59] going to keep it for myself
[26:01] no he redeemed it for her
[26:04] he gave it to her so christ came
[26:06] remember i told you before this brings
[26:07] out the
[26:08] outstanding quote where the prophet god
[26:10] said jesus didn't come to bring you your
[26:12] inheritance
[26:13] he came to bring you to your inheritance
[26:15] so there's the redemption
[26:17] that's why eternal redemption that's why
[26:19] brother brown tells us is one of the
[26:21] oldest things in the book of the bible
[26:23] redemption was before the foundation of
[26:24] the world
[26:26] it's not just something that just
[26:28] developed
[26:31] but you know thank god for a prophet
[26:32] though that could
[26:34] see i don't think any other prophet
[26:35] maybe paul
[26:37] was close but i was thinking about this
[26:38] the other day there's no other prophet
[26:40] of god
[26:41] that could take
[26:43] the mind of god
[26:46] and bring it so vivid that we can
[26:48] understand it
[26:49] because it's way back here way back in
[26:51] eternity way back there no way you can
[26:54] understand this guy
[26:56] we understood who jesus was kinda
[27:00] second person of the trinity whatever
[27:02] whatever you understand what i mean
[27:03] before we came to the message but it
[27:05] took a profit to take us back here
[27:08] and tell us where we came from what
[27:10] we're doing here and where we're going
[27:13] most everybody else
[27:15] talk about denominations and everyone
[27:17] they tell you where we're going but they
[27:18] don't have a real good idea about where
[27:20] we're going
[27:23] we got to go through tribulation we got
[27:24] to go to this we got to go to we got to
[27:26] go to purgatory we got to go this place
[27:28] we got to go that you see what i mean
[27:31] prophet god said nope no such thing as
[27:32] purgatory
[27:34] hell is not burning at the moment
[27:38] it's the fifth dimension it's where you
[27:39] go we understand that we're going to
[27:41] look at the dimensions
[27:42] maybe in a couple of sundays
[27:44] but remember brother brown gives us a
[27:46] real good definition of redemption he
[27:48] says to bring it back or to bring back
[27:51] right
[27:52] all right you had to put something you
[27:53] got in trouble
[27:55] you had to put something in the pawn
[27:56] shop but now remember
[27:58] you got to have something to purchase it
[28:01] to get it back you can't just go back
[28:03] and say hey i want my stuff back
[28:04] no you got to pay a price right
[28:07] jesus christ but see remember we
[28:09] couldn't pay the price once we got in
[28:11] the pawn shop
[28:12] we couldn't pay the price see even when
[28:15] him adam sold us out he got put in the
[28:17] pawn shop but adam couldn't bring
[28:19] himself back out
[28:20] he wasn't a savior he wasn't the
[28:22] redeemer he was a son of god
[28:25] but he wasn't a redeemer so any action
[28:28] he did
[28:30] kept him in the pawnshop
[28:32] and literally let me tell you something
[28:34] literally though from adam to jesus
[28:36] christ everybody stayed in the pawnshop
[28:44] that right right there was no redemption
[28:46] there was no eternal life given in the
[28:49] soul of man in the old testament
[28:51] right
[28:53] it stayed up there because remember
[28:54] we're going to look in our timeline and
[28:56] i'm going to use
[28:58] should i use blue for eternal
[29:01] or red for eternal you choose
[29:07] you said blue first
[29:09] don't be swayed by all them people back
[29:10] under i asked you
[29:12] i asked you and they answered
[29:14] i throws blue myself too thank you
[29:17] whoever said red you're wrong
[29:19] okay
[29:25] all right this is eternal
[29:27] or eternity our god or the mind of god
[29:31] all right everybody got that
[29:32] uh
[29:33] all right and here's the eternal line
[29:36] and you're gonna see it on your chart in
[29:37] a minute
[29:38] if you want to look at it you can that's
[29:39] okay but now remember down here is
[29:42] i'm going to just put us
[29:46] got it
[29:47] eternal in us
[29:50] everybody got that saying man
[29:52] this cannot ever change
[29:55] this will
[29:57] this will change
[30:00] because it's not eternal
[30:02] it's in time
[30:04] eternal will never change
[30:06] always was
[30:09] always will be
[30:11] and this is right here i'm going to put
[30:12] this just for anywhere you see that
[30:14] right there
[30:17] you see everybody got that there we see
[30:18] that
[30:19] dot
[30:22] that's god
[30:24] everybody okay with that
[30:25] and then this is
[30:27] us
[30:28] every time i make a little red dot
[30:29] everybody got that
[30:33] because i want to tell you something
[30:36] if you think you came here with
[30:38] something that somebody else didn't have
[30:40] then god is not a respecter of persons
[30:43] and he cannot judge the person that he
[30:45] didn't put here on earth with whatever
[30:47] you think you got when you got here on
[30:49] earth that's why i asked you when you
[30:51] closed your eyes i asked you
[30:55] you never made a mistake you never done
[30:57] anything wrong baloney
[31:02] so we change
[31:04] we change our mind he can't
[31:07] everybody got that we can change our
[31:09] mind he cannot so here we go through
[31:11] here let's look number one
[31:13] so remember redemption is to bring back
[31:15] look if we were right here if we were in
[31:18] him if we were thought of him a thought
[31:22] of god before the foundation of the
[31:23] world which we were if we have eternal
[31:26] life then whatever the fall caused
[31:29] it brought it down through to here
[31:34] everybody got that
[31:37] cause that's what the fall means
[31:40] it was up here at one time
[31:43] can you pick that up for me
[31:47] it was up here at one time though
[31:49] and it went down here but now
[31:51] god didn't come and redeem this
[31:53] he redeemed what fell
[31:55] everybody got that
[31:57] redemption is not
[31:58] replacement amen
[32:00] he didn't replace listen that's what you
[32:02] got look at what brother brown was
[32:03] talking about he did not replace
[32:06] anything he didn't say well no i think
[32:08] i'll just wipe that off and i'll start
[32:09] back over here no that's where he
[32:11] started
[32:12] that was his thought his thought was
[32:13] eternal it never can change never will
[32:15] change
[32:16] but as we were talking before we'll get
[32:18] into it later
[32:20] he had attributes
[32:22] that couldn't be displayed if we stayed
[32:25] right here
[32:27] everybody got that
[32:29] because us is sick
[32:32] us is falling falling
[32:35] us is born in sin shaping in the nick we
[32:37] come to the world speaking lies
[32:39] us have wrong ideas
[32:41] us came wrong to start with
[32:44] he didn't
[32:46] but whatever if we started right here
[32:49] bro chris once we got to get back to
[32:51] that spot
[32:53] we gotta get right here back to this
[32:55] spot
[32:57] we're down here now
[32:59] we're in lifetime and matter we'll get
[33:01] into those dimensions later on but i got
[33:03] to bring this out because
[33:05] that may be a question in your mind and
[33:06] i know that
[33:08] ninety percent of the people in this
[33:10] message believe that we came here with
[33:11] this eternal something in us uh you know
[33:13] what you say well i got quotes well i
[33:15] just quoted you two quotes that looked
[33:16] like they were totally opposite
[33:19] brother brown said you always was
[33:20] eternal he said right here in 1960
[33:22] that's your eternal life began at the
[33:24] altar
[33:26] you say oh i always was a wheat germ no
[33:28] no we fixing to read eight quotes where
[33:30] brother brown said you were a cuckleberg
[33:33] and by the transforming power of god he
[33:35] changed you into a wheat right now see i
[33:38] like to think that i don't like to think
[33:40] that i always was eternal because if i
[33:42] was doing them things
[33:44] and i hate eternal life in me
[33:47] no forget it folks
[33:50] be sensible
[33:53] be sensible when i was out there laying
[33:55] it
[33:56] in sin
[33:58] sure god was right here
[34:02] he never moved
[34:03] he never blacked me out oh hallelujah
[34:07] but he knew i'd come back to that
[34:10] but i wasn't there to begin with
[34:12] right here i'm talking about right here
[34:14] i was in eternity
[34:17] but see it took a profit to tell us what
[34:18] the mind of god was talking about
[34:20] not what we're talking about
[34:23] because right here this was born in sin
[34:24] shaped an iniquity a spouse from a
[34:26] mother's womb a liar
[34:28] brother brown said he was lost
[34:31] that's what he said
[34:33] i was lost he said i used to if you ever
[34:35] see you don't read all the quotes you
[34:36] read the ones you want to read
[34:38] brother brown said i washed my car and
[34:40] watched people go to church on sunday
[34:43] a prophet
[34:45] no let me tell you something
[34:47] why didn't paul this is in my notes i'm
[34:49] going to get to it right now why didn't
[34:51] paul
[34:52] just when he was hey listen what was he
[34:54] doing he was causing
[34:56] real
[34:57] true believers
[34:59] to blaspheme
[35:01] putting them in prison and killing them
[35:04] now how can something be eternal inside
[35:06] of paul and let him do what he did
[35:09] no way
[35:11] why did he go to damascus and god had to
[35:14] knock him off of the horse and he didn't
[35:16] look down and say now paul you always
[35:18] was eternal now no he said paul you're
[35:22] blind
[35:24] and i'm gonna take you
[35:28] what are you doing what'd you do that
[35:29] for
[35:36] leave it right there i'll get it later
[35:39] no he said paul you're blind
[35:42] you're persecuting me
[35:46] and if me was in paul why was he doing
[35:49] it
[35:50] no but he had representation
[35:53] he knew god knew when he knocked paul
[35:56] off the horse
[35:59] he would
[36:00] change
[36:01] but not right then bible says he went
[36:04] three days
[36:06] blind as a bat
[36:09] and he said
[36:11] i'm going to have to have somebody come
[36:12] pray for you
[36:14] that's got to see life inside of them
[36:16] now why did he not do why why didn't he
[36:18] just say paul now you always was eternal
[36:20] why in the world don't you just get up
[36:22] and go start preaching the gospel
[36:24] that ain't the way god works folks right
[36:27] right amen right i don't understand this
[36:30] when people say god's brother brother
[36:32] said we always were eternal yeah eternal
[36:33] life always was but i wasn't
[36:38] where are you going to put justification
[36:40] in this
[36:41] where are you going to put
[36:42] sanctification where the unclean spirit
[36:44] goes out of you where out of your soul
[36:47] so you and god can't be a well you satan
[36:50] and god can't be in your soul see you're
[36:51] almost too soul
[36:53] that stupid doctrine they said that
[36:54] satan put a soul inside of you and god
[36:56] put a soul inside him satan can't give
[36:58] you a soul
[37:00] he ain't a soul maker
[37:03] god is a soul maker
[37:05] and a soul destroyer satan can't even
[37:08] destroy your soul
[37:11] what the bible say don't fear the one
[37:13] that can kill the body
[37:14] you fear the one that can kill the soul
[37:19] so we've got to keep it separate
[37:21] if we don't keep it separate
[37:24] i just i don't understand how that we
[37:26] can kick redemption totally out of the
[37:28] picture
[37:29] right because the bible says the unclean
[37:31] spirit goes out of a man walks to dry
[37:32] places seek his rest find us none
[37:36] now did you have an eternal something
[37:37] inside your soul at that time no
[37:40] because the bible says
[37:42] i'm talking bible you say i got clothes
[37:45] if the quote don't match the bible he's
[37:47] wrong
[37:50] but he don't
[37:53] you see how these other people have all
[37:54] these doctrines
[37:56] because they take quotes
[37:58] and they don't put it with the bible
[38:02] and put the essence together
[38:05] brother brown says let's address stand
[38:07] up and address the third person of the
[38:08] trinity well now he wasn't a trinitarian
[38:10] prophet
[38:16] if we don't get these right folks people
[38:18] we're going by the grave
[38:21] if we don't get it right
[38:23] you can have your idea for as long as
[38:25] you want to but your idea we're going to
[38:26] put you in the ground and say
[38:28] we'll see you in the
[38:31] i didn't want to say that see any
[38:33] resurrection
[38:34] anyway redemption is to bring back
[38:35] number one
[38:37] redemption is the oldest
[38:39] thing in the bible
[38:41] so what is redemption redemption is not
[38:43] just realizing you were
[38:45] realized it's bringing you back
[38:47] right
[38:49] i realized i was lost
[38:52] redemption's one of the oldest things in
[38:53] the bible do you know redemption was
[38:54] ever before the plan of redemption look
[38:56] look at me was laid out before the
[38:58] foundation of the world
[39:01] that's right
[39:03] and if bob black was here he'd tell you
[39:04] what that little dot right there is
[39:07] genesis 1 26
[39:10] 27
[39:13] that's why genesis 1 26 27 is so
[39:15] important if you can understand that you
[39:17] can understand where you come from right
[39:19] what you're doing here and where you're
[39:21] going
[39:22] amen
[39:24] but i want you to remember everybody
[39:25] says no after the seal's broke brother
[39:27] brown changes no
[39:28] show me
[39:30] show me
[39:31] where he changed future home he says
[39:34] i've preached the same three stages of
[39:36] grace from the time i was a little boy
[39:39] amen and i have quotes here from 1964.
[39:44] but find me one quote where brother
[39:46] brown said you didn't need salvation
[39:48] that's right
[39:52] find me one
[39:54] he might have said you always was he
[39:56] might have said all this he might have
[39:57] said all that you had this little germ
[39:58] of life inside of you show me one place
[40:00] where he said well you don't need
[40:01] salvation anymore you just need to
[40:03] believe that
[40:05] ain't it happening right
[40:07] you can't destroy the plan of salvation
[40:10] glory because this plan of salvation was
[40:12] before brother branham got here
[40:16] and before you got here right
[40:18] before adam got here
[40:21] plan of redemption was laid out before
[40:23] the world was ever formed think of that
[40:24] god foreseeing now we're going to talk
[40:26] about in a minute making a way
[40:27] of redemption before he even made the
[40:30] world because why he knew we were going
[40:32] to come to right here
[40:35] because up here
[40:37] when we get to glory back to this spot
[40:39] right here this
[40:41] this future home
[40:43] when we all get together in the future
[40:45] home
[40:46] there's no sin there's no sorrow there's
[40:48] no shame there's no agony there's no
[40:50] virus there's no lying there's no
[40:51] stealing there's no
[40:53] you can see what i'm saying
[40:56] but if you weren't here to begin with
[40:59] you have nothing to go back to right
[41:02] because redemption remembers not
[41:04] replacement redemption is bringing you
[41:05] back to where you began
[41:08] glory everybody got that
[41:12] all right let's read uh first
[41:14] corinthians
[41:16] but we speak
[41:17] the wisdom of god in the mystery
[41:20] even the hidden wisdom which god
[41:22] ordained before the world
[41:25] unto our glory
[41:28] remember god didn't need us
[41:31] we need god
[41:32] right and like brother dale
[41:35] god chose that he needed a body down
[41:37] here
[41:39] god chose that we the bride when he said
[41:42] let us make man he couldn't take that
[41:44] back
[41:46] he had to produce this right here
[41:48] amen everybody got that amen
[41:51] all right
[41:52] titus 1 1 paul the servant of god an
[41:55] apostle of jesus christ
[41:57] according to the faith god's elect the
[41:59] acknowledging of the truth which is
[42:01] after godliness
[42:02] and hope of eternal hope of eternal life
[42:04] i thought we always was
[42:07] in hope of eternal life which god that
[42:09] cannot lie promise before
[42:12] the world amen began
[42:14] everybody got that but hatha look blood
[42:17] hath in due times manifested his word
[42:20] through preaching
[42:22] which is committed unto me according to
[42:24] the commandment of god our savior
[42:26] now let's go to ephesians one this is
[42:27] where we'll
[42:29] we're gonna i don't yeah let's read all
[42:31] of it
[42:32] well you know this let's go to verse
[42:34] four according as he hath chosen what us
[42:36] in him hold on us in him
[42:41] before the foundation of the world there
[42:43] we go back to that spot right there
[42:44] we're bringing it right back to here
[42:46] he chose us
[42:49] in him before the foundation of the
[42:50] world that we should be holy and without
[42:53] blame before him in love verse 7 in whom
[42:56] we have redemption through his blood the
[42:58] forgiveness of what
[43:00] sins according to the riches of his
[43:01] grace wherein he has abounded toward us
[43:03] in all wisdom and prudence look
[43:05] having made known unto us the mystery
[43:07] of his will
[43:10] according to his good pleasure which he
[43:12] has purpose in himself that in the
[43:14] dispensation of the fullness of times
[43:16] that's right now folks
[43:18] he might gather together in one all
[43:20] things in christ both which are in
[43:22] heaven and which are on earth even in
[43:24] him
[43:25] in whom also we have what obtained an
[43:27] inheritance
[43:29] hmm
[43:30] obtained
[43:32] we had to go get it
[43:35] the bible says after you heard the word
[43:36] of salvation
[43:38] you received your new birth in other
[43:40] words after you heard
[43:42] faith comes by what hearing right right
[43:47] you had to hear the word
[43:50] before you can be born again
[43:52] why didn't paul just listen paul knew
[43:54] the old testament
[43:55] from kever to kibber
[43:58] right
[43:59] why didn't he just all of a sudden when
[44:00] god came to him he just said whoa
[44:02] man i'm this wonderful
[44:05] three days he went blind
[44:07] god let him chew on it for a little
[44:09] while
[44:10] and then he said no paul i
[44:12] i'm going to have to send somebody
[44:14] that's already in the body
[44:16] somebody that's born again and nice
[44:17] remember and nice had a little problem
[44:19] with it too because then i said i don't
[44:20] know if i'm want to touch that dude or
[44:21] not
[44:22] he's killing us
[44:24] but what did jesus what did god say god
[44:26] said go on
[44:28] he's my servant
[44:29] i've picked him and then the bible says
[44:31] his scales fell off his eyes
[44:34] and he received the holy ghost
[44:36] huh kind of simple revelation 13 8 all
[44:39] that dwell on earth shall worship him
[44:40] whose names are not written in the book
[44:41] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[44:44] foundation of the world now also
[44:45] remember
[44:47] this is the book of life i mean book of
[44:50] life eternal section
[44:52] everybody got that
[44:54] book of life
[44:56] eternal
[44:57] because there's many different stages of
[44:59] the book
[45:00] remember when you come down here
[45:02] even brother brown says when you come
[45:04] into sanctification we'll get to this
[45:05] later on in sanctification your name
[45:07] goes on the book of the believer it's
[45:09] transferred there is a book of life and
[45:11] that's what's in revelations 19 or 20
[45:13] when the book is open
[45:16] and all that are judged they're judged
[45:19] out of that book of life
[45:21] normal life
[45:23] you and i are already judged right here
[45:25] we were judged before the foundation of
[45:27] the world
[45:29] never to be judged again now you can
[45:32] hallelujah for that all you want to
[45:33] because i believe that
[45:35] because your name's in that lounge book
[45:36] of life you're right there
[45:38] and that's where you're going back to
[45:41] right
[45:42] but you also were in a book down here
[45:44] when you became on this earth
[45:46] there was a recording
[45:49] of what you were doing
[45:51] when you become to the age of
[45:52] accountability
[45:54] a tape recorder came on
[45:57] and you know what until you're justified
[46:00] that tape recorder stays on and if you
[46:02] don't ever get that erased
[46:06] you'll meet it over here on the white
[46:07] throne judgment right
[46:10] but brother chris if you
[46:12] come through justification sanitation
[46:14] and receive be reborn
[46:17] reborn
[46:19] not born this is born this is reborn
[46:22] everybody got that
[46:24] you need two births
[46:27] hey man you got to have a physical birth
[46:29] but you got to have a spiritual birth
[46:32] nicodemus you must be born from above oh
[46:35] i need to go back and get in my mother's
[46:36] womb he was down here
[46:38] carnal mind
[46:40] god was telling him he said what you got
[46:41] to be born from where
[46:43] above
[46:44] up here
[46:46] a spiritual birth
[46:48] have i got that
[46:50] number two
[46:51] prophet of god in christ the mistress
[46:53] that he has showed or revealed and every
[46:54] type that's in the bible therefore the
[46:56] entire bible is a revelation of god's
[46:58] mystery in christ
[47:00] the entire bible is an expression of one
[47:02] goal that god had
[47:04] now what was that one goal
[47:06] get us back to right here he knew we
[47:07] were going to fall
[47:09] he knew we were going to fall
[47:12] but he knew he was going to have
[47:13] fellowship with us again right here
[47:15] but if we stayed like i said before
[47:17] realize this if we if he stayed right
[47:19] here he would just be
[47:22] father
[47:25] he came down here and became a son
[47:29] son of man
[47:31] flesh led brother dale said
[47:32] then you and i became son of samuel and
[47:35] peggy dale or whoever you your mom and
[47:36] daddy was right
[47:39] but that didn't negate this right here
[47:40] if you were right here
[47:43] but look you come down here you go
[47:45] savior
[47:46] healer
[47:47] redeemer
[47:49] all in all lily of the valley rose of
[47:51] sharon bright morning star you see all
[47:53] these all these attributes this eternal
[47:56] but he had to do that down here with
[47:58] someone that's lost as we read that
[48:00] quote
[48:01] that we'll read maybe if we get to it in
[48:03] ephesians church age to give him purpose
[48:05] he had to let man come to flesh and fall
[48:08] he had to let man come into human flesh
[48:10] and fall to to have him an eternal
[48:13] purpose
[48:15] right to get us back to right here
[48:18] listen once we
[48:21] once eve's womb was polluted
[48:25] with natural seed
[48:28] everybody got that now we're talking
[48:30] natural once her womb was polluted by
[48:31] natural seed her spiritual womb up here
[48:33] was polluted she couldn't get back to
[48:35] here
[48:38] we had to fall down here so it's called
[48:39] the fall one more time
[48:41] we fell down to here
[48:46] now what are we doing we're still we're
[48:47] continuing on with life and we'll get to
[48:49] it but we're going to come right back to
[48:50] there because redemption is not
[48:52] replacement
[48:54] it's bringing you back to where you were
[48:55] before
[48:57] real simple
[49:00] the entire bible is an expression of one
[49:01] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[49:03] to achieve in the entire bible
[49:05] all the acts of the believers in the
[49:06] bible has been entitled
[49:09] and expressing what god's great goal is
[49:11] and now in this last day he has revealed
[49:13] it and showed it amen i believe listen
[49:16] we're living in an open book
[49:19] but
[49:20] guys brothers sisters believe me brother
[49:22] brown didn't come to bring us eternal
[49:24] life right
[49:28] he didn't come to bring us a message
[49:31] to tell us how to get eternal life at
[49:33] the beginning
[49:37] it's always been in the bible
[49:39] right people were born again before the
[49:40] problem got here
[49:45] we know what his message was his message
[49:47] was what go back in the mind of god
[49:50] seals open when the seals opened the
[49:53] mind of god opened showed us right here
[49:55] where we were
[49:58] so that this guy can be changed
[50:02] listen by the new birth we've been since
[50:04] the 120 in the upper room they've been
[50:06] changed in their soul right
[50:08] but they had to die and keep dying and
[50:10] keep dying because he didn't have all
[50:12] the word of god
[50:15] you and i now have all the word of god
[50:16] to get us back to right there
[50:20] because of the opening of the seals
[50:22] it gives us a chance to take on
[50:25] a new body
[50:27] not a new different one
[50:29] this one made new
[50:32] so
[50:34] you can tell me all you want to the
[50:35] brother brown chain he didn't ever
[50:36] change the body he can't change the
[50:38] bible
[50:39] that same way with daniel 70 weeks i'll
[50:41] contend anybody right now
[50:43] the bible says there's one week left
[50:45] after the rapture i really don't care
[50:47] what nobody else says
[50:49] i'll take what god says but i know what
[50:50] brother ryan was talking about maybe you
[50:52] don't
[50:54] because he can't change the bible
[50:57] can't change the bible
[51:00] he shall make a covenant with many for
[51:01] one week
[51:03] and in the midst of that week he'll
[51:04] break the covenant there's one week left
[51:06] after we leave here to finish daniel 70
[51:09] weeks so you just don't you're just not
[51:11] getting what he said you know what it is
[51:12] last night you know what i was thinking
[51:14] of this and i was going through it
[51:15] i was mulling over it
[51:19] just as plain as day
[51:22] something spoke to me and said
[51:24] there's that other spirit
[51:27] remember i've been preaching on two
[51:28] spirits
[51:30] because any other spirit contrary to
[51:32] what god's word is is the other
[51:34] spirit oh but i got quotes
[51:38] quotes will kill you
[51:41] didn't the pharisees say we got moses in
[51:43] other words we got moses message we got
[51:45] moses quote book
[51:47] jesus said if you didn't own him you
[51:48] know me
[51:50] if you know what he was saying you know
[51:51] what i was saying
[51:54] he came exactly as the word said and
[51:55] they killed him
[51:58] number three christ the mystery god
[51:59] revealed now god's great secret mystery
[52:02] now back in the back part of god's mind
[52:04] there was something he was going
[52:06] trying and was going to achieve and he
[52:08] had a motive in doing it well it was a
[52:10] motive to get us back
[52:12] through all of his after get all of his
[52:14] attributes back to
[52:16] eternal because he knew we were going to
[52:18] fall
[52:20] but he wasn't a savior right here
[52:23] he's a savior when we come down to here
[52:25] right amen everybody got that say amen
[52:28] all right
[52:29] so in his great mind number 103 these
[52:32] attributes to be expressed and then him
[52:33] was love and then we'll see there's his
[52:34] attributes father
[52:36] son savior and him was to be a healer
[52:41] there had to be something lost right
[52:44] to have a savior
[52:48] not just you always was
[52:51] we always was lost until god came into
[52:53] my life
[52:54] i promise you that
[52:56] now god had a purpose in a hidden
[52:57] mystery and that's what i want to speak
[52:59] on the church this morning
[53:01] the hidden mystery of god that he had in
[53:03] his mind before the world ever began
[53:05] and how that it unfolded itself right
[53:07] down to this present hour that we're
[53:08] living in then you'll understand clearly
[53:11] you see i believe what is being done
[53:14] revelations 12 7 there was war in heaven
[53:17] and michael and his angels fought
[53:18] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[53:20] in his angels and prevailed not neither
[53:22] was their place found anymore in heaven
[53:23] so here's heaven
[53:26] satan was right there when god said that
[53:27] but satan wasn't a part of that
[53:31] satan's not part of that genesis 1 26
[53:33] come on people good grief
[53:35] but he was standing there when god said
[53:37] i'm going to have a group of people
[53:39] they're my children
[53:41] they're inside of me as attributes you
[53:45] can't see them yet
[53:47] just like
[53:48] daddy didn't see me until i was born
[53:53] but see god's not like that so chris he
[53:55] knew everybody i'll read you a quote in
[53:57] a minute where brother brown said your
[53:58] hair color what you look like god knew
[54:01] it for the foundation of the world your
[54:03] natural life
[54:05] he knew that
[54:07] revelation 12 7 prevail not neither was
[54:10] a place found in heaven
[54:11] the great dragon was cast out the old
[54:13] serpent called the devil and satan
[54:15] he was cast out where into the earth
[54:18] and his angels were cast out with him
[54:20] see they fell first they fell from their
[54:22] first estate talking about jude 1 verse
[54:24] 5
[54:24] verse 6 the angels which kept not their
[54:26] first estate but left their own
[54:28] habitation he has reserved an
[54:29] everlasting change under darkness that
[54:32] unto the judgment of the great day so
[54:34] what happened they all came down here
[54:35] see see satan can work his way back and
[54:37] forth
[54:39] but he can't ever get to that he can
[54:40] just get over into another dimension
[54:42] then he work through one two three even
[54:44] four
[54:46] amen
[54:47] the devil go right through that building
[54:49] if he wants to but he come down here to
[54:51] what tried to destroy us to block us
[54:53] because that's what he'd done he blocked
[54:55] the
[54:56] spiritual womb and the physical wound
[54:59] he blocked it from us going back to here
[55:02] or from any of these children to be born
[55:04] because god can't come through an
[55:06] unclean vessel
[55:08] everybody got that
[55:11] so i said that god the bible tells us
[55:14] god won't dwell on an unclean vessel
[55:17] i was
[55:18] unclean
[55:20] were you not
[55:22] we all were
[55:24] everybody got that
[55:26] all right now let's
[55:28] read genesis 1 26 we know what that is
[55:30] let us make man in our image
[55:32] after our likeness and let them have
[55:34] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[55:35] fowl the air
[55:37] over cattle and all the earth and over
[55:38] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[55:40] the earth so god created man in his own
[55:41] image and the image of god created in
[55:43] him
[55:44] male and female created he them that was
[55:45] right here before he even put him in
[55:47] human flesh
[55:48] that was right here
[55:51] and he gave and i'm
[55:52] lord forgive me
[55:54] he gave adam
[55:57] we're going to put some hair in the
[55:58] dress on this one
[56:00] he gave adam and eve
[56:03] dominion she was in him right
[56:07] then he put them two seven
[56:10] he put he put them together he put then
[56:12] he separated them put him in flesh
[56:15] then took a rib and put her in flesh so
[56:16] there they stand
[56:18] and it's still part of eternity because
[56:20] brother brown said time did not begin
[56:21] until the fall happened
[56:23] all right
[56:24] to me that's just pretty sensible
[56:26] so they were up here
[56:28] they fell down past that line
[56:31] right
[56:33] they fell that's what you call one more
[56:35] time it's why they called it fought
[56:37] they fell they fell down here to what
[56:40] die in humanity
[56:42] but remember before the world ever begun
[56:45] there was a lamb slain already for them
[56:48] there was a perpetuation already made
[56:51] for them
[56:53] before god even literally ripped the
[56:55] skins off of the
[56:57] um
[56:58] sheep and threw them in there told them
[56:59] to put these on right
[57:02] now genesis 2 7 says look and lord god
[57:04] formed man of the dust of the ground and
[57:06] breathed in his nostrils the breath of
[57:07] life
[57:08] and man became a living
[57:12] soul
[57:13] i like that
[57:16] then he planted the garden and told him
[57:17] said hey till the garden but what
[57:19] happened was satan got involved and the
[57:21] beast got involved we know what happened
[57:23] then they fell they come down here into
[57:24] time
[57:26] and look
[57:29] he had the book
[57:32] with the names on it now you got to say
[57:34] oh no he didn't no he didn't but in
[57:37] symbolic
[57:38] this is all the names that will ever be
[57:40] saved in the lounge book of life the
[57:41] eternal sections everybody got that
[57:44] got it
[57:46] adam was going to produce this with eve
[57:49] by this spoken word
[57:52] not by literal seed like we're talking
[57:54] about because remember why do we why why
[57:57] one more time seed
[58:00] equals
[58:01] word
[58:03] and god only there's no other seed
[58:07] the bible says in what is it colossians
[58:09] where he says not seeds of many but one
[58:11] seed which is christ and what is christ
[58:14] he's the word amen amen in the beginning
[58:16] was the word where is it god where it
[58:17] was god
[58:35] i've got a big mark on the front of my
[58:38] plain little white coat here all right
[58:41] so now let's go to number four
[58:44] we start the fact that there are two
[58:46] seeds
[58:48] there are two
[58:49] trees in the midst of the garden now
[58:51] what's a tree a tree brings forth fruit
[58:54] right
[58:55] and in that fruit is seed everybody got
[58:57] that say amen the tree of life was jesus
[59:00] the other tree is definitely satan
[59:01] because of what came forth of the fruit
[59:04] of that tree
[59:06] now then we know that both of these
[59:07] trees had a relationship to man
[59:10] what the tree of life would keep you up
[59:13] here
[59:14] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[59:16] would put you down here everybody got
[59:18] that
[59:19] amen
[59:22] the problem is though
[59:23] the tree of life can come down here and
[59:25] save us the tree of knowledge of good
[59:27] and evil can't go back up that way
[59:29] because we were born off the tree of
[59:31] knowledge of good and evil
[59:32] i'll bring you another quote next sunday
[59:34] where brother brown said you were born
[59:35] between satan
[59:37] and eve
[59:38] you were
[59:40] tell me how good you are
[59:43] tell me how good what all this great
[59:45] stuff you had inside of you
[59:47] oh i got quotes
[59:51] the pharisees killed jesus because of
[59:53] quotes
[59:55] they did not realize the essence of that
[59:58] old testament was standing in human
[1:00:00] flesh in front of them
[1:00:02] they read it by letter and they killed
[1:00:04] the very person that wrote it don't you
[1:00:07] think they're going to do the same thing
[1:00:09] today
[1:00:10] you're going to not be killed by how
[1:00:12] good or bad you are you're going to be
[1:00:14] killed by what you stand for
[1:00:17] and i say that personally or even like
[1:00:19] brother chris and i you know brother
[1:00:20] brown so you can't don't have to kill
[1:00:21] the man you just kill his influence
[1:00:23] and that kills the man okay
[1:00:30] but it's like brother brown said he says
[1:00:34] i
[1:00:36] was lost
[1:00:38] i was a cuckolder i'm fixing to read it
[1:00:40] to you in just a minute oh no that he
[1:00:42] had to be i was always a wheat plant
[1:00:45] well okay hang on man we'll see right
[1:00:47] here you are
[1:00:49] but down here you weren't
[1:00:53] to me that's so very simple that's so
[1:00:56] very simple
[1:00:58] you were not born wheat
[1:01:00] in your natural life
[1:01:02] but there was a representation of you
[1:01:04] right there
[1:01:05] that stayed there stood there did not
[1:01:08] move but it met you down here in time
[1:01:15] to me that's just so
[1:01:16] to me that really makes the plan of
[1:01:19] salvation it makes me love him more than
[1:01:21] from somebody just walk up and say don't
[1:01:23] you realize you always were eternal we
[1:01:24] were back there don't you just feel me
[1:01:26] and you were back there before the
[1:01:27] foundation of the world no
[1:01:32] i didn't know nothing until i was about
[1:01:33] five years old
[1:01:35] some of you might say 55 years old
[1:01:38] well i'm 61 now so i've known some for
[1:01:40] six years thank you very much
[1:01:44] yeah i'm 61 mile
[1:01:46] now we know that both of these trees
[1:01:47] makes hey that makes him
[1:01:50] old now then we know both of these trees
[1:01:53] had a relationship to man or they never
[1:01:55] would have been placed there they must
[1:01:57] have had a part in the look the
[1:01:58] sovereign plan and purpose of god
[1:02:01] sovereign
[1:02:02] nobody else is going to change it god
[1:02:04] already had it worked out knew that tree
[1:02:07] was going to be there knew we were going
[1:02:09] to eat off of it
[1:02:14] but he didn't make us eat off of it
[1:02:18] we chose ourself
[1:02:22] and we can never impute omniscience unto
[1:02:24] god this is all true so far is it not
[1:02:25] now look now the word most definitely
[1:02:28] sets forth that from before the
[1:02:30] foundation of the earth the purpose of
[1:02:32] god look was to share his eternal life
[1:02:35] with man amen
[1:02:37] now look if man can't get it now right
[1:02:40] here after adam and eve
[1:02:43] if man can't get it anymore
[1:02:46] the book went back into the original
[1:02:47] owner's hand the genesis 1 26 the list
[1:02:50] of everybody that was to be bride went
[1:02:52] back to the hands of the eternal god
[1:02:56] because he couldn't trust it with me and
[1:02:58] you anymore
[1:02:59] he couldn't trust it with seth
[1:03:02] he couldn't trust it with enoch even he
[1:03:05] couldn't trust it with these people down
[1:03:06] here
[1:03:07] remember this is all substitute this is
[1:03:10] all
[1:03:11] the blood of bulls and goats covered
[1:03:16] covered sin
[1:03:17] this has no sin
[1:03:20] so we were down here sinful
[1:03:23] god capo or covered us
[1:03:25] until we what
[1:03:27] cried out by father daddy daddy i need
[1:03:30] you
[1:03:30] and what responded that right there
[1:03:34] because she was back there as the woman
[1:03:36] in the well she was back there
[1:03:38] in that not as a person not as a being
[1:03:41] she was part of that eternal life to me
[1:03:43] that's just so simple you know what no
[1:03:45] but it confounds people that say oh i
[1:03:47] got this quote right here
[1:03:49] so
[1:03:50] i can quote a lot of things
[1:03:55] brother brown said
[1:03:57] evil woman is not no more
[1:03:59] than a
[1:04:00] bullet to the head
[1:04:02] you know what he said
[1:04:06] hmm
[1:04:12] just telling you i'm telling you we can
[1:04:13] sit here and we can quote and quote and
[1:04:15] quote and quote and argue and argue and
[1:04:17] argue and argue i don't argue anymore
[1:04:20] this is the truth
[1:04:22] i don't care nobody you can bring it on
[1:04:24] bring it on
[1:04:26] it better match the word of god first
[1:04:30] it better match the word of god first
[1:04:34] and go back to the saying
[1:04:36] brother branham was a word prophet he
[1:04:38] could not change the bible
[1:04:40] he only spoke to us
[1:04:42] the love letter but remember the love
[1:04:44] letter he said listen the prophet of god
[1:04:46] said now the listen if you're reading a
[1:04:48] love letter it can't just be something
[1:04:50] different than what's above it and
[1:04:51] what's below it
[1:04:53] it's got to be in continuity or the
[1:04:55] essence
[1:05:00] listen the very
[1:05:01] reason we're having birthdays should
[1:05:04] tell you that we were born wrong
[1:05:09] that person never had a birthday
[1:05:12] it always was
[1:05:15] all right um
[1:05:18] where am i at
[1:05:19] oh go to ephesians 1
[1:05:21] in that right yeah according to he has
[1:05:22] chosen us we read that before the
[1:05:23] foundation of the world so i may be
[1:05:25] maybe four o'clock i'm sorry
[1:05:27] but we should be holding without blame
[1:05:28] before him in love i'm trying as fast as
[1:05:30] i can
[1:05:31] brother hal thomas says i run out past
[1:05:33] him sometimes i fly too fast
[1:05:35] having predestinated us until the
[1:05:37] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:05:38] what to himself
[1:05:40] now wait a minute predestinated us
[1:05:43] unto adoption
[1:05:45] now the word predestinate is pretty
[1:05:50] destin
[1:05:52] or predetermined
[1:05:54] destiny
[1:05:58] have i got that
[1:06:02] but the prophet of god said god did not
[1:06:03] put you in a tube
[1:06:06] and pulled you through that tube
[1:06:08] that's predestined
[1:06:11] pre-determined destination i know you're
[1:06:13] going to preach on
[1:06:15] you got to still do it
[1:06:17] best i ever heard on predestination
[1:06:19] brother dale preached several years ago
[1:06:21] he said he was going to do it again but
[1:06:23] remember
[1:06:25] when did he choose us
[1:06:27] before
[1:06:29] the foundation of the world four f
[1:06:33] o
[1:06:34] r
[1:06:35] e b
[1:06:36] four
[1:06:39] having predestinated uh it destinated us
[1:06:43] before the financial world he
[1:06:44] predestinated us into the adoption of
[1:06:46] children by jesus christ because
[1:06:47] remember remember he's omniscient
[1:06:48] omniscient omnipotent he knows all
[1:06:50] things he knew when he said let's make
[1:06:52] man in our own image where we'd have to
[1:06:54] come back to
[1:06:55] there's not one person going to be saved
[1:06:57] that didn't get that wasn't up there all
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] right
[1:07:01] that's pre-destined
[1:07:03] it's predestined because he saw your
[1:07:05] destiny
[1:07:07] because right here we go for knowledge
[1:07:10] let's go to this right here
[1:07:12] for knowledge
[1:07:15] for knowledge four
[1:07:19] four oh i can't i can't hide it
[1:07:22] four
[1:07:23] anyway sorry pull it down here a little
[1:07:25] bit further brother joe or richard
[1:07:28] four
[1:07:30] for knowing
[1:07:33] b4
[1:07:35] we knew it
[1:07:37] he knew it right
[1:07:39] for
[1:07:40] knowledge
[1:07:42] now let's read this quote right here
[1:07:43] smyrna church age
[1:07:48] everybody got it
[1:07:49] now then they were coming to a
[1:07:50] conclusion as the eternal logos god was
[1:07:53] manifested in the sun and then jesus
[1:07:56] dwelt all the fullness of the godhead
[1:07:57] bodily and that eternal one was the
[1:08:00] father manifested in flesh by the little
[1:08:01] priests on this morning and thereby
[1:08:03] gaining the title of son not making him
[1:08:06] another son
[1:08:07] gaining the title of son even so we look
[1:08:11] eternal watch eternal in his thoughts
[1:08:14] not down here
[1:08:15] eternal in his thoughts
[1:08:17] right nobody got that
[1:08:21] eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:08:24] you had a turn right
[1:08:27] it wasn't just a blanket
[1:08:29] as soon as he was born you got eternal
[1:08:31] life
[1:08:32] wrong answer
[1:08:34] zach always said wrong answer
[1:08:35] ghostwriter that ain't gonna work cause
[1:08:37] that ain't redemption
[1:08:41] that's just saying you got it
[1:08:44] you ain't gotta do nothing
[1:08:48] eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:08:53] became the many-membered what
[1:08:56] spoken word seed exactly
[1:08:58] not this guy
[1:09:00] this is dead seed
[1:09:06] manifest in flesh
[1:09:09] and those eternal
[1:09:11] thoughts
[1:09:13] right here those eternal thoughts
[1:09:16] now being made manifest
[1:09:18] because there was a man named jesus came
[1:09:20] and paid the redemption price
[1:09:23] so that we could get back to that and
[1:09:25] that could what find us
[1:09:28] we didn't find him
[1:09:29] he found us
[1:09:30] [Applause]
[1:09:32] i'll raise my hand toe sister hallelujah
[1:09:34] i'm glad he found me
[1:09:37] manifest in flesh and those eternal
[1:09:38] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[1:09:41] sons of god even as we are so called
[1:09:43] look we did not become seed by the
[1:09:45] rebirth look
[1:09:46] it didn't change this right here
[1:09:49] that stayed right there
[1:09:52] but see people don't read the whole part
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:55] we are seed
[1:09:57] and therefore what
[1:09:59] you had to do something
[1:10:01] it didn't say therefore you always were
[1:10:03] eternal no you had to be re-born
[1:10:10] by a new birth
[1:10:12] consisting of justification
[1:10:13] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:10:15] holy ghost you were reborn
[1:10:19] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:10:24] because we were seed as a reason we
[1:10:26] could be quickened or
[1:10:29] reborn but there had to be rebirth
[1:10:34] in non-seed look
[1:10:40] did you do my red ink paint
[1:10:47] this is the billions of people on the
[1:10:49] earth today and has been since the
[1:10:51] foundation of the world they never were
[1:10:53] right there
[1:10:57] they were in the mind of god as a person
[1:10:59] as an individual as life he gave them
[1:11:01] life but he gave them a choice
[1:11:04] but he knew their choice because of for
[1:11:08] knowledge
[1:11:11] because of four
[1:11:12] knowledge
[1:11:13] he could look and see down through time
[1:11:16] who would and who wouldn't these just
[1:11:18] came and brother brown calls him cannon
[1:11:20] fodder now i don't call him cannon
[1:11:21] fodder but he did
[1:11:24] nothing but cannon fodder i got to find
[1:11:26] my red ink pen somewhere guys
[1:11:29] but that's the way you came and then i
[1:11:31] then i read you the quote and the bible
[1:11:33] says we're in continuance we came forth
[1:11:35] in other words he knew we were coming to
[1:11:38] but we had to come down here and get in
[1:11:40] this mix
[1:11:45] but what was our representation down
[1:11:47] here
[1:11:50] right here
[1:11:52] you heard
[1:11:53] from your theophany
[1:11:58] you heard from that eternal part
[1:12:00] you didn't come down here look
[1:12:02] you didn't come down here like this
[1:12:09] that's your soul yeah that gives you two
[1:12:11] souls
[1:12:12] you were lost
[1:12:15] now this found you
[1:12:20] because you were born
[1:12:21] i'm gonna put cockle burr cause we're
[1:12:24] gonna read what brother branham says
[1:12:27] you were a kookaburra
[1:12:29] and he was a cuckoo bird now what you
[1:12:31] gonna do with those quotes when you say
[1:12:32] oh no i i'm no i i'm always i always was
[1:12:35] yeah you always that seed always was
[1:12:38] but you had to go by
[1:12:40] reborn
[1:12:41] right
[1:12:44] you had to go through the process
[1:12:46] of rebirth
[1:12:49] now let's go to number five
[1:12:53] oh wait a minute that's
[1:12:55] what's this now
[1:12:57] y'all read these quotes up here and said
[1:12:58] oh i always was eternal i always had
[1:13:00] this eternal seed i mean yada yada yada
[1:13:02] but you didn't read this part
[1:13:05] this is the next paragraph just one more
[1:13:08] you know kind of between the lines of
[1:13:09] the level that are you supposed to read
[1:13:11] that when you read it at the top
[1:13:12] supposed to compare with the next quote
[1:13:18] redeem now why do we need redemption
[1:13:23] if we didn't fall from somewhere
[1:13:25] hold this carefully in your mind
[1:13:28] now take the next step
[1:13:32] redeemed means to buy back
[1:13:35] it restores to the original owner
[1:13:39] god by his death
[1:13:41] the shed blood bought back
[1:13:45] his own
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:50] he bought back the spoken word
[1:13:53] seed bride
[1:13:56] my sheep hear my voice word and they
[1:13:59] follow me they always were a sheep oh
[1:14:01] wow now about yeah you always wear sheep
[1:14:04] this was
[1:14:05] this one
[1:14:08] down here wasn't
[1:14:10] this was always a sheep
[1:14:14] you got to watch that where he says you
[1:14:17] because i'm going to tell you i got you
[1:14:18] a million other places where you were a
[1:14:20] cuckoomer
[1:14:23] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[1:14:25] into a sheep
[1:14:26] that's because of this right here
[1:14:29] not this down here
[1:14:31] have i got that
[1:14:33] folks we were lost
[1:14:35] right
[1:14:36] without salvation
[1:14:40] a cuckolder
[1:14:42] doomed and on our way to hell
[1:14:44] all right let's go to
[1:14:47] the next quote number five
[1:14:49] okay look
[1:14:50] we'll cover this for just a few minutes
[1:14:52] the word predestinate
[1:14:54] that's not a good word to use
[1:14:56] the word for knowledge is better why
[1:14:58] because if you look and you say you look
[1:15:00] up the word predestination that means
[1:15:03] pre-determined destiny
[1:15:07] in other words it's pre-arranged you're
[1:15:09] going to take this destination and this
[1:15:10] is your end
[1:15:12] now see god knows that
[1:15:14] so it's not a bad word if you understand
[1:15:16] what you're talking about
[1:15:18] but now go lord brother brown says now
[1:15:20] the word
[1:15:21] for knowledge is better because look
[1:15:31] for knowledge
[1:15:34] now what does destiny do though
[1:15:36] predestination looks back
[1:15:44] to foreknowledge
[1:15:46] because the bible says those he foreknew
[1:15:48] look right here those he foreknew
[1:15:51] he did predestinate to come down here
[1:15:53] and take a journey
[1:15:56] but knowing that one day this
[1:15:58] was going to change into a wheat
[1:16:03] and then
[1:16:09] you go right back to there
[1:16:15] i'm just reading quotes
[1:16:17] you figure out
[1:16:18] predestination looks back to
[1:16:20] foreknowledge
[1:16:22] and foreknowledge looks to destination
[1:16:25] but god not making set it in order a
[1:16:28] little hole that you have to go through
[1:16:32] see that's predetermined right
[1:16:34] put you in a tube and say all right bro
[1:16:35] chris this is no i told y'all before god
[1:16:38] is so all-knowing he knew
[1:16:40] who if you married another girl what
[1:16:43] would happen if you never got married he
[1:16:45] knew what would happen if you only
[1:16:48] no god no
[1:16:50] for knowledge
[1:16:52] he knew you we limit god so much
[1:16:56] he's all-knowing
[1:16:58] but he saw that you would want it so bad
[1:17:01] because what the deep
[1:17:03] called to the deep
[1:17:05] cause there was a deep to respond
[1:17:08] i was lost why would i need to respond i
[1:17:11] don't listen
[1:17:15] at this point in your journey if you're
[1:17:16] born again your soul doesn't respond
[1:17:18] like that anymore
[1:17:20] it always was eternal
[1:17:22] because it has come together in a union
[1:17:27] read god's power to transform in a union
[1:17:31] brother brown said it's you and god now
[1:17:33] and there's persons
[1:17:35] and then i can say
[1:17:37] that's where i came from
[1:17:40] this is where i'm going i mean this is
[1:17:42] why where i'm at and that's back where
[1:17:43] i'm going to
[1:17:47] real simple
[1:17:48] but god not making said an order a
[1:17:50] little hole that you have to go through
[1:17:52] and can't go no other way
[1:17:55] see he would be an unjust god
[1:17:58] to do that
[1:17:59] he cannot judge you
[1:18:01] by making you do something
[1:18:06] but god in order to be god he knowed the
[1:18:09] end from the beginning so we had
[1:18:12] predicted
[1:18:13] and set things in order
[1:18:15] to happen by what for
[1:18:18] knowledge now let's go to number six
[1:18:22] where i think pentecost failed now the
[1:18:24] word is used here in the fifth verse of
[1:18:25] predestination predestinated it's not a
[1:18:28] very good word for an evangelist or a
[1:18:29] minister to use because it's kind of
[1:18:31] confusing people when you say
[1:18:33] predestinate look predestination speaks
[1:18:36] looks back to foreknowledge
[1:18:38] foreknowledge looks to destination
[1:18:41] predestination goes way back to
[1:18:44] foreknowledge
[1:18:45] right here
[1:18:48] the mind of god
[1:18:51] predestination goes back to foreign
[1:18:53] knowledge for knowledge goes to
[1:18:55] destination in other words god didn't
[1:18:56] say now i'll make this man be this see
[1:18:59] he can't be a righteous judge if he said
[1:19:01] i'm gonna make chris lost
[1:19:03] and i'm gonna wait make way saved
[1:19:07] he can't judge him for being lost all
[1:19:08] you got to do is look at god and say you
[1:19:10] made me this way
[1:19:12] you you made me this way you made me do
[1:19:14] that
[1:19:15] but no you can't do that we're all born
[1:19:18] free moral agents
[1:19:20] even after you're born again you've
[1:19:21] still got free moral agency
[1:19:24] i'll make this man to be that but in
[1:19:26] order to be god he had to know the end
[1:19:28] from the beginning so in order to
[1:19:30] foreknowledge that he knew he could say
[1:19:33] this would happen and that would happen
[1:19:35] because he's god and knowed where
[1:19:37] everything would be placed and therefore
[1:19:39] he could ordain certain things for
[1:19:41] certain ages
[1:19:44] that's why he ordained us to be in this
[1:19:46] age
[1:19:48] another age couldn't take what we're
[1:19:50] taking that's right
[1:19:51] another age couldn't take the word like
[1:19:53] we're taking the word right brother
[1:19:54] brown preached the countdown we're
[1:19:56] astronauts we're pressurized more than
[1:19:58] anybody else is now you say boy that's
[1:20:00] that no that ain't that ain't him
[1:20:02] picking one over another one
[1:20:04] he just knew by foreign knowledge you'd
[1:20:06] make it in this age
[1:20:08] and somebody else would not
[1:20:10] that's truly scripture all right let's
[1:20:11] continue reading
[1:20:13] number seven
[1:20:16] everybody all right for a minute i know
[1:20:17] it's 3 30 but you know what
[1:20:21] sit and watch a movie for longer than
[1:20:22] this
[1:20:24] watch this now
[1:20:26] listen to this
[1:20:27] predestination looks back to
[1:20:29] foreknowledge
[1:20:30] this is 1960 now i mean election
[1:20:33] election looks back to foreknowledge and
[1:20:36] predestination looks to destiny don't
[1:20:39] forget that that election looks back
[1:20:41] here here it is
[1:20:43] i was a cuckleberg
[1:20:47] i was born in sin shaped an iniquity
[1:20:50] come to the world speaking lives born
[1:20:52] amongst sinners father and mother and
[1:20:55] all my whole family sinners i was a
[1:20:58] kookaburra
[1:20:59] but all of a sudden
[1:21:04] raise it on up there i was a what
[1:21:07] i was a what
[1:21:10] huh
[1:21:11] but all of a sudden i became a wheat
[1:21:13] germ
[1:21:15] how did it happen
[1:21:17] that's what is that election god before
[1:21:20] the foundation of the world what elected
[1:21:23] that this kookaburra he knew i was going
[1:21:25] to be
[1:21:26] this but he knew i'd want to be that
[1:21:30] and he put it right there
[1:21:33] and he can't change it
[1:21:37] can't change god's mind
[1:21:39] god before the foundational world
[1:21:40] elected that the kokomor was to become a
[1:21:42] grain of wheat
[1:21:44] now i know i'm a grain of wheat because
[1:21:46] i'm saved
[1:21:49] i've been reborn
[1:21:52] how do i do it
[1:21:54] look back and see that he predestinated
[1:21:57] it long time ago
[1:21:58] by foreign knowledge he seen that i
[1:22:01] would love him
[1:22:03] so he made a perpetuation through his
[1:22:05] own son that through him i might become
[1:22:08] from a cuckolder to a grain of wheat
[1:22:11] now where am i at now i'm saved
[1:22:17] now listen the wheat always wasn't wheat
[1:22:19] because it was right here
[1:22:21] but remember we had a fall down here
[1:22:23] that put us down this way
[1:22:25] and we were cuckobers we were born wrong
[1:22:28] everybody okay with that
[1:22:30] my father and mother and whole family
[1:22:32] how could he say that that'd be kind of
[1:22:34] hard but he said all my family were
[1:22:35] drunks
[1:22:37] wow
[1:22:39] look at number eight
[1:22:42] questions and answers this is 1964 after
[1:22:45] the seals
[1:22:46] for those of you that need that
[1:22:48] how can i take a cuckoo bird and make a
[1:22:50] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[1:22:53] for me to do it
[1:22:56] reading the quote it's impossible for me
[1:22:58] to do it
[1:22:59] the only way it can be is because inside
[1:23:02] that cucumber has been
[1:23:04] transmitted from a kookaburra wheat
[1:23:08] right
[1:23:09] a kokober to a germ called wheat life
[1:23:13] wait a minute
[1:23:15] inside it has been transmitted
[1:23:21] we receive eternal life
[1:23:24] then you bury that kookaburra
[1:23:26] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[1:23:33] because there has been a life of wheat
[1:23:35] put in that kookaburra
[1:23:40] everybody all right with that
[1:23:44] i'm just reading quotes after the seals
[1:23:47] for those of you that need that
[1:23:49] because there's been a life of wheat put
[1:23:51] in
[1:23:52] the kookaburra
[1:23:56] and the life of the kookaburra
[1:23:58] has been taken out
[1:24:01] but watch hold on he's not done yet
[1:24:04] but the nature of the kuckelber is still
[1:24:07] sticky
[1:24:09] and it will be until this new life has
[1:24:12] fully been developed out of the ground
[1:24:14] and raised up again when it comes forth
[1:24:17] then it's no more cocklebury he's
[1:24:19] talking about this guy right here now
[1:24:22] cause watch it when it comes forth then
[1:24:24] it's no more cooker burr but wheat but
[1:24:25] wheat but while it's here on earth
[1:24:28] and that in the out of the earth and the
[1:24:30] kookaburra it's still sticky
[1:24:32] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[1:24:35] it of wheat
[1:24:37] as long as you're in this life you're
[1:24:39] going to be sticky and have a carnal
[1:24:41] nature that's going to bother you as
[1:24:44] long as you live
[1:24:46] that's right
[1:24:47] because you can't deny that you were
[1:24:49] born a human
[1:24:51] you can't deny you were born lost
[1:24:56] but
[1:24:58] the inside of you
[1:25:00] you're born again
[1:25:02] and when you're raised up you're in the
[1:25:04] likeness of christ and all that
[1:25:06] kuckelberg goes away cause remember you
[1:25:09] weren't a cuckold bird right here
[1:25:12] and when that thing bursts forth it does
[1:25:14] away with that
[1:25:16] and it puts you right back out
[1:25:19] right back where god's thought of you to
[1:25:20] start with
[1:25:22] and guess what you've done you picked up
[1:25:24] a flesh body during that whole journey
[1:25:26] you picked up a flesh body just like he
[1:25:28] did
[1:25:30] god was right here no flesh body he had
[1:25:32] to come down here and get a flesh body
[1:25:34] to die
[1:25:37] and when he died he took us right back
[1:25:39] to there
[1:25:42] all the sin is gone that's the thing i
[1:25:44] love that quote there
[1:25:45] number nine the token
[1:25:48] keep going i want to read just the red
[1:25:50] part
[1:25:52] the bible said he that's born of god
[1:25:54] just roll it back down sorry just let me
[1:25:56] read that whole paragraph the bible said
[1:25:58] he that's born of god does not commit
[1:25:59] sin for he cannot sin
[1:26:03] for the seed of god what what what don't
[1:26:05] sin
[1:26:07] the inside guy
[1:26:08] the wheat guy
[1:26:10] kunkelberg guy still does remember he's
[1:26:12] sticky
[1:26:13] but the inside the wheat guy he don't
[1:26:15] sin he's that genesis 1 26 man
[1:26:18] that's going to carry us back to eternal
[1:26:20] life
[1:26:21] in body spirit and soul the seed of god
[1:26:23] remains in him and how can he sin when
[1:26:25] the sinless god is in him when he's in a
[1:26:28] sinless god how can he sin
[1:26:30] no matter what he's done the blood's
[1:26:32] covered him see he's a new creature
[1:26:37] our creation
[1:26:39] his desires and ambitions is of heaven
[1:26:42] it was not when you were growing up and
[1:26:45] doing the things of the world you
[1:26:46] weren't thinking about heaven
[1:26:49] you might thought you were in heaven for
[1:26:51] some of the things that you did
[1:26:52] but it was white brother brian said oh
[1:26:55] that woman you know pulled the beer
[1:26:56] bottle up said this is life
[1:26:58] he said he didn't she didn't know that
[1:27:00] the very thing she called life was to
[1:27:03] kill her
[1:27:06] his desires and ambitions is of heaven
[1:27:08] because he's changed oh here it is again
[1:27:11] from a coca-burr to a wheat
[1:27:13] his desires ain't the same as they once
[1:27:15] was
[1:27:16] and he
[1:27:18] displays it
[1:27:22] go to the next one number 10.
[1:27:25] but what is it what we are this is 1961.
[1:27:28] we are now wheat a grain of wheat and
[1:27:30] god's garner
[1:27:32] when we was a cuckleber
[1:27:35] and god changed us from a cuckleburg to
[1:27:37] a grain of wheat
[1:27:38] it makes the fruits different
[1:27:41] changing your own mind your own ideas
[1:27:44] it's the greatest miracle that ever
[1:27:47] happened
[1:27:48] amen
[1:27:51] the greatest miracle brother is that you
[1:27:54] have been changed
[1:27:56] from the inside
[1:27:59] and god came down and give you eternal
[1:28:01] life
[1:28:03] and you become a new creation
[1:28:06] old things have passed away behold all
[1:28:08] things that what become new
[1:28:12] just listen if i'm wrong
[1:28:14] leave me alone
[1:28:17] i like this
[1:28:21] because i can love him more
[1:28:24] if i knew he saved me from that junk i
[1:28:26] was in
[1:28:27] than to just tell me i always was
[1:28:29] something and i was this special person
[1:28:31] yeah and listen folks please in god you
[1:28:34] were a special person
[1:28:36] i believe from the day you were born you
[1:28:37] had a special angel to watch over you
[1:28:39] because you know what satan want to kill
[1:28:40] you every second
[1:28:43] but there was an anointing over you that
[1:28:45] god knew by foreknowledge
[1:28:47] he had to let you get to 38 years old
[1:28:51] look at me 38 years old
[1:28:55] i wandered in the wilderness of sin for
[1:28:57] 38 years
[1:29:00] but he knew one day he would call and
[1:29:02] not answer
[1:29:04] and i'd hear from that right there
[1:29:06] now you can leave me alone
[1:29:09] like that
[1:29:11] that he thought enough of me to save me
[1:29:14] not just tell me i always was something
[1:29:16] but now listen but being born again and
[1:29:18] coming to adoption we look back into the
[1:29:20] mind of god and we see that that's where
[1:29:22] we came from we see that that's what god
[1:29:25] done but he doesn't negate or do away
[1:29:28] with the plan
[1:29:31] when a man or woman is born again of the
[1:29:33] spirit of god it becomes a new creature
[1:29:36] in christ jesus number 11.
[1:29:40] the rest read the red
[1:29:42] just for sake of time
[1:29:44] i was a cuckoo bird
[1:29:47] and he made a wheat out of me
[1:29:50] i don't know how it ever come
[1:29:53] i said how could it ever be
[1:29:55] he threw up his hands one day wherever
[1:29:57] it was on the railroad track or out in
[1:29:58] the hog pin or wherever he was and he
[1:30:00] said lord i'm done
[1:30:03] god had to save a prophet uh-huh
[1:30:06] god had to say paul didn't he
[1:30:09] so god had to say william branham too he
[1:30:11] was lost
[1:30:15] boy people don't like that
[1:30:17] well let's go to the next one
[1:30:19] we're gonna read this and then we'll
[1:30:20] stop
[1:30:22] we're gonna talk a minute about
[1:30:23] representation because you know what
[1:30:24] this is where i'm if you're born again
[1:30:26] everybody that's born again is
[1:30:28] represented right here
[1:30:31] book of your life book of life eternal
[1:30:33] section genesis 1 26 man seed of god
[1:30:37] word of god
[1:30:38] attribute of god
[1:30:40] son of god
[1:30:41] always was eternal never had a beginning
[1:30:44] never had an end never sinned never was
[1:30:47] lost we got lost down here
[1:30:50] in the kuckleberg part right
[1:30:53] but god came down in the kuckleberg park
[1:31:00] and brought us back to
[1:31:03] well they already this morning by the
[1:31:05] ministry of what reconciliation
[1:31:08] he reconciled us back to christ not to
[1:31:10] tell us we always was
[1:31:13] until you get up until you get born
[1:31:15] again and start looking and saying oh
[1:31:18] because brother brandon will tell you he
[1:31:19] said don't you remember when you were a
[1:31:21] young person
[1:31:22] and all your other buddies wanted to go
[1:31:23] out and i do
[1:31:25] i listen
[1:31:27] i joined in the gang sometimes
[1:31:29] but sometimes i didn't
[1:31:32] and it was because i think the the
[1:31:34] little the angel said now if you go out
[1:31:35] there buddy you're in trouble
[1:31:38] so i'd stay home i'd quit doing
[1:31:39] something brother brown said you
[1:31:40] remember you know you always
[1:31:42] they you know they want to go smoke and
[1:31:44] go drink or do something he said there's
[1:31:45] always a little something inside of you
[1:31:48] they said don't do that
[1:31:50] now listen that was god
[1:31:52] but you know what that was that was
[1:31:54] because of this right here
[1:31:56] not because it was in here
[1:31:59] i was hearing from something up here
[1:32:02] i was hearing from that angel that was
[1:32:05] given me
[1:32:06] that come from god and was not fallen
[1:32:08] that other angel folks if you don't like
[1:32:11] it you just
[1:32:12] brother dale said put it in your pocket
[1:32:14] and sit down on top of it there's
[1:32:15] another one sitting on this shoulder
[1:32:18] one of them fallen ones are sitting over
[1:32:19] here on this side going go ahead
[1:32:22] it's okay
[1:32:24] how many times you went down the road
[1:32:26] how many times you got out of a car and
[1:32:29] found out your buddy had a wreck i've
[1:32:31] known i've never happened to me but i've
[1:32:32] known a few people to do that and it
[1:32:35] really tore them up bad but but see
[1:32:37] that's god guiding us
[1:32:39] that i believe but that didn't make me
[1:32:41] wheat right
[1:32:43] that gave me representation
[1:32:46] that i was going to become wheat down
[1:32:48] here
[1:32:52] because of this right here everybody
[1:32:54] goes to the woman at the well i'm gonna
[1:32:55] ask you a question before we go down
[1:32:56] here
[1:32:58] before we go down this road
[1:33:02] how in the world now the bible says
[1:33:04] here's bible
[1:33:06] and by the way i'm listening for a
[1:33:07] minute
[1:33:08] you've been doing pretty good today
[1:33:10] the bible says
[1:33:12] now listen to me
[1:33:15] that we were born in sin right shaping
[1:33:17] iniquity
[1:33:20] and the bible tells us that until the
[1:33:22] day of pentecost i believe it's john 5.
[1:33:25] said the holy ghost had not been given
[1:33:26] yet everybody understand that
[1:33:30] because jesus had the holy ghost inside
[1:33:32] of him
[1:33:33] he was the only one that had it
[1:33:35] nobody in the old testament had it we'll
[1:33:37] cover that later but let's get down to
[1:33:38] jesus he had eternal life in his soul he
[1:33:41] was the soul of eternal life nobody got
[1:33:44] there
[1:33:45] but it was encapsulated in that
[1:33:48] body
[1:33:49] and couldn't get out
[1:33:51] remember jesus didn't save one person on
[1:33:53] this earth
[1:33:54] while he was on earth
[1:33:58] wow
[1:33:59] tell me one
[1:34:01] you said oh the woman at the well
[1:34:02] brother bram said she got eternal life
[1:34:04] folks that's another thing i'm telling
[1:34:06] you the bible says nobody got eternal
[1:34:08] life
[1:34:09] until jesus died you can't tell me a
[1:34:11] prostitute got eternal life before the
[1:34:13] 12 disciples did
[1:34:15] but you got to understand what he's
[1:34:17] saying
[1:34:20] she had representation
[1:34:23] i believe she went to the upper room i
[1:34:24] believe she was one of the ones in the
[1:34:25] upper room that's what i believe
[1:34:27] because i don't believe she wants no
[1:34:28] daughter of a god standing in front of
[1:34:31] in front of jesus that day
[1:34:33] she couldn't get eternal life he had it
[1:34:35] inside of him
[1:34:37] but remember he breathed on the
[1:34:39] disciples and said receive you the holy
[1:34:41] ghost now they didn't receive it brother
[1:34:42] brown said that was a what
[1:34:44] promise
[1:34:46] a few days later on the day of pentecost
[1:34:49] that's when the holy ghost came and went
[1:34:51] inside their soul burnt the kookaburra
[1:34:53] out
[1:34:54] and put the weed in
[1:34:59] but no look this little woman had
[1:35:01] nothing
[1:35:02] to present
[1:35:04] she was as filthy and as dirty as she
[1:35:06] could be
[1:35:07] that's me
[1:35:10] but notice way down in her she's got
[1:35:13] representation where way down in her
[1:35:17] where
[1:35:19] it wasn't eternal life in a place
[1:35:23] because she couldn't get it in her soul
[1:35:25] she had representation right here
[1:35:28] actually
[1:35:29] she was standing
[1:35:31] in front of her reputation her
[1:35:33] representation
[1:35:35] she was standing because you know what
[1:35:36] jesus said
[1:35:38] watch
[1:35:40] he said
[1:35:43] oh wait a minute
[1:35:45] what was her representation
[1:35:47] look and then she was looking for this
[1:35:51] to be made flesh
[1:35:56] she might have been a prostitute
[1:35:59] but somewhere
[1:36:01] she read a bible
[1:36:05] remember brother brown said mary would
[1:36:06] sit on
[1:36:08] on her mother's knee and she would read
[1:36:09] to him myself
[1:36:11] where a virgin shall conceive
[1:36:14] because look
[1:36:16] she's going to respond
[1:36:19] by what she heard right previously
[1:36:22] because remember look what is this right
[1:36:24] here
[1:36:25] see
[1:36:26] his word
[1:36:28] all right everybody got that
[1:36:29] way down in her she got representation
[1:36:31] see and then she was looking for this to
[1:36:33] be made flesh
[1:36:35] when he said go get your husband and
[1:36:37] come here she said sir i have none said
[1:36:39] you've said the truth because you got
[1:36:42] five and the one you have now is not
[1:36:43] yours you've had five that makes six you
[1:36:46] had she said sir
[1:36:48] not your belzybub
[1:36:51] i perceive that you are a prophet now we
[1:36:54] know
[1:36:57] she wasn't a bumbling idiot
[1:37:00] she had studied the scripture
[1:37:02] somebody had read to her the old
[1:37:03] testament somebody had given her what
[1:37:07] a seed
[1:37:08] word
[1:37:11] somebody had planted
[1:37:13] a seed
[1:37:15] in her right
[1:37:18] and she says i perceive that you're a
[1:37:20] prophet
[1:37:21] now we know the messiah which is called
[1:37:23] the christ will come
[1:37:25] and when he does
[1:37:26] he'll do this
[1:37:28] what was the response
[1:37:30] was what she had heard
[1:37:33] the word that was planted in her heart
[1:37:35] not an eternal place in her soul right
[1:37:39] sorry
[1:37:41] he said i'm he
[1:37:42] now look
[1:37:43] because she said what she said she had
[1:37:45] representation
[1:37:49] no more doubt
[1:37:50] you didn't have to explain it she saw it
[1:37:52] she believed it the way she went why
[1:37:54] what did it do to her it redeemed her
[1:37:57] potentially
[1:37:59] but that was her road
[1:38:01] she throwed her sins away her water pot
[1:38:04] down and ran into the city and said come
[1:38:06] see a man
[1:38:07] amen
[1:38:12] now watch he came to be a redeemer is
[1:38:14] that right what does redeem mean bring
[1:38:17] back
[1:38:18] why didn't he get the priest
[1:38:21] he never was up
[1:38:25] there
[1:38:29] he wasn't right there
[1:38:31] but she was that's right
[1:38:35] what does redeem me bring back why
[1:38:37] didn't he get the priest he never was up
[1:38:40] there see
[1:38:41] he had no
[1:38:43] representation
[1:38:45] he came to redeem that which had what
[1:38:48] fallen
[1:38:50] in the fall this got messed up with that
[1:38:53] girl
[1:38:54] but god had her in his thinking before
[1:38:58] the foundation of the world and he come
[1:39:00] to cleanse her
[1:39:02] then he she had eternal life
[1:39:05] where the priest what did it do to him
[1:39:07] it sent him right back to his
[1:39:08] destination he had nothing to begin only
[1:39:12] intellectual learning now listen friends
[1:39:13] if the only thing you've got
[1:39:15] is just quotes
[1:39:22] you get something different from that
[1:39:25] and you'll never be able to get it
[1:39:27] unless you got representation
[1:39:31] you'll never be able to get it right
[1:39:34] unless you got representation
[1:39:41] now let me read this one and i will stop
[1:39:43] right here
[1:39:46] proving his word
[1:39:47] 1964.
[1:39:49] he said salvation is of the jew woman
[1:39:52] we know what we're talking about he said
[1:39:55] you worship you don't know what
[1:39:57] a jew is supposed to know the word see
[1:39:59] how it was supposed to be but see he was
[1:40:02] watching now
[1:40:03] why he's going to what is he going to do
[1:40:06] prove his word why she he said by the
[1:40:09] way you go get your husband and come
[1:40:11] here
[1:40:13] roll on up please
[1:40:15] i know y'all working overtime i'm sorry
[1:40:18] by the way go get your husband and come
[1:40:20] here and she said i don't have any
[1:40:21] husband
[1:40:22] first thing she done was she didn't lie
[1:40:24] to the lord
[1:40:25] she approached him the right way she
[1:40:27] could have said but god i'm married
[1:40:31] i always was no
[1:40:34] i don't have one husband why he said
[1:40:36] you've told the truth see because you've
[1:40:38] had five and the one you have now is not
[1:40:40] your husband see watch something
[1:40:42] happened
[1:40:43] something took life
[1:40:45] now if it hadn't been in there to begin
[1:40:47] with
[1:40:48] and where in the seed word the word she
[1:40:51] heard
[1:40:53] the word she heard if it hadn't been in
[1:40:55] there to begin with if she hadn't had
[1:40:57] what representation from predestination
[1:41:01] amen
[1:41:02] it never took hold
[1:41:04] she had representation from right here
[1:41:09] the priest lived a life down here and
[1:41:11] never had representation up here because
[1:41:13] god knew they would continue to be
[1:41:15] cucker birds and deny the very word of
[1:41:16] god but he knew she was sorry for what
[1:41:20] she had done she had been taught wrong
[1:41:22] or something had happened but she had
[1:41:24] read enough of the word
[1:41:27] that's where the seed lays folks the
[1:41:29] seed don't lay in you the seed lays in
[1:41:31] that word right there
[1:41:33] because the word
[1:41:35] is a seed
[1:41:36] and the seed
[1:41:38] is a word you love the lord
[1:41:41] i got a bunch more but we'll we'll stop
[1:41:42] right here
[1:41:46] musicians come
[1:41:50] but that's what we're going to be
[1:41:52] talking about because we're going to
[1:41:52] bring some more quotes
[1:41:55] and things from
[1:41:57] from
[1:41:58] the prophet
[1:42:04] and like i said before you you can quote
[1:42:06] all you want to
[1:42:08] but
[1:42:10] see the thing i see is if we're not
[1:42:12] right
[1:42:13] we're wrong
[1:42:16] that's just the way it is
[1:42:18] i'll get it buddy you stay right there
[1:42:19] if i'm if we're not right we're wrong
[1:42:21] brother ray we just
[1:42:23] one way or the other
[1:42:24] thank you brother richard
[1:42:26] just lay it in there because i'll
[1:42:27] probably need it next week
[1:42:29] but i want you to understand i've heard
[1:42:31] ever since i come back in this message
[1:42:33] and thank god for a preacher that don't
[1:42:35] preach that stuff
[1:42:40] there we go thank you
[1:42:44] but you know what it's so close if you
[1:42:45] don't have somebody to separate it and
[1:42:47] break it apart and break it down like
[1:42:48] brother they did a long time ago and now
[1:42:51] then i wouldn't understand it i just
[1:42:53] said oh really i you know i always was
[1:42:55] eternal no i always was
[1:42:58] because i was in the mind of god i
[1:42:59] always was
[1:43:01] listen this is where you get your
[1:43:02] eternal life right from right here
[1:43:08] and you continue to grow because of
[1:43:11] right here
[1:43:14] and this
[1:43:15] was not in me
[1:43:17] when i was out there doing the things i
[1:43:18] was doing
[1:43:19] neither was it in you i just
[1:43:22] just quit denying what you were that's
[1:43:25] right i was a cuckoo bird the prophet of
[1:43:27] god said he was a koco bear
[1:43:29] we were all born cuckoo birds anybody
[1:43:31] that was born
[1:43:32] of a man and a woman in the culver
[1:43:35] but you had representation
[1:43:37] if you came to it one day you already
[1:43:40] had that representation and that
[1:43:42] representation
[1:43:43] remember i told you
[1:43:45] adam
[1:43:46] had to give the book back
[1:43:49] to the original owner right christ
[1:43:52] himself
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] but what did he do with it he didn't
[1:43:57] keep it up here
[1:43:59] he brought it down here and started
[1:44:00] writing
[1:44:02] genesis exodus leviticus numbers
[1:44:04] deuteronomy
[1:44:06] then he what then this book
[1:44:09] was made flesh
[1:44:13] like he wanted it brother chris before
[1:44:14] the foundation of the world he wanted
[1:44:16] this right here to be flesh
[1:44:19] a body
[1:44:20] thou has prepared me brother they'll
[1:44:22] stop he needs to read that next
[1:44:24] that next one says
[1:44:25] low in the volume of the book i come
[1:44:31] this book right here
[1:44:33] this book was before the foundation of
[1:44:35] the world
[1:44:36] it had your name in it
[1:44:40] bill john it had your name in it
[1:44:43] it had my name in it
[1:44:44] but it was hidden
[1:44:46] since the foundation of the world
[1:44:48] only to be revealed when i responded
[1:44:52] that day when i was right here and
[1:44:54] wanted god to forgive me in my sins
[1:44:55] because i knew i was lost
[1:44:58] i knew i needed salvation i knew brother
[1:44:59] chris i needed justified i needed
[1:45:01] sanctified and i needed god to burn that
[1:45:04] cuckoo bar out of me
[1:45:06] and put something inside of me and what
[1:45:09] did i look to you say no i look to jesus
[1:45:11] christ well jesus christ is what
[1:45:14] the word was made flesh
[1:45:17] and dwelt among us
[1:45:18] this word now is being made flesh and
[1:45:21] dwelling among us
[1:45:23] no difference except that you were born
[1:45:25] wrong
[1:45:26] and he was born right that's the only
[1:45:27] difference between us and jesus christ
[1:45:28] he was born right and we were born wrong
[1:45:31] let's stand our feet god bless you thank
[1:45:32] you for listening
[1:45:34] but a body thou has prepared me that's
[1:45:36] what it was
[1:45:39] but he allowed mom and dad to bring your
[1:45:42] natural body here because he couldn't
[1:45:44] anymore
[1:45:46] and i want to ask you one more question
[1:45:51] wasn't mary magdalene i mean listen
[1:45:54] sorry wasn't mary the mother of jesus
[1:45:57] the bible says she had to go to the
[1:45:59] upper room and get born again right
[1:46:01] why didn't she need to do that she had
[1:46:03] something inside of her that was
[1:46:07] no she was still a cuckleberg
[1:46:12] had to receive
[1:46:14] seed
[1:46:15] she had to receive she said being under
[1:46:17] me according to that word sure the
[1:46:18] natural part came but then she had to go
[1:46:20] to the pentecost
[1:46:22] to the upper room to receive what she
[1:46:26] had birthed
[1:46:27] but not the natural person
[1:46:30] the spirit that was inside that person
[1:46:33] she received the new birth all right
[1:46:36] they didn't 120 of them stand up and say
[1:46:38] oh we always was this is it we always
[1:46:41] was no
[1:46:43] no
[1:46:44] peter said this is that though
[1:46:46] because where'd he go to he went right
[1:46:48] back to here
[1:46:49] book of joel he said this is that
[1:46:52] then i'll come and pour out my spirit
[1:46:53] upon all flesh
[1:46:55] and we're gonna be signs and wonders
[1:46:56] being happening and they burst out that
[1:46:58] door and they didn't care who bothered
[1:47:00] them or who wanted to kill them
[1:47:03] but chris they didn't care
[1:47:05] i wish sometimes we get to where we
[1:47:07] don't care
[1:47:08] what the world thinks about us i don't
[1:47:10] care what nobody thinks about me as long
[1:47:12] as i can stay right here
[1:47:14] as long as i can stay right here this is
[1:47:16] my shelter
[1:47:17] this is your shelter and you need to
[1:47:19] believe that this is your shelter
[1:47:21] this message of the hour and this bible
[1:47:23] is just like i've got it in there it's
[1:47:26] all in there together
[1:47:28] there's nothing outside
[1:47:31] that this wonderful prophet brought us
[1:47:34] it can't be different than what this is
[1:47:38] it's got to be out of right here
[1:47:42] and it is
[1:47:44] but you got to pray about it folks you
[1:47:45] can't just run wild
[1:47:50] that woman at the well waited long
[1:47:52] enough
[1:47:53] to where she said
[1:47:56] like hattie wright she said that ain't
[1:47:57] nothing but the truth
[1:48:00] come see a man
[1:48:02] that's told me all these things aren't
[1:48:04] we looking for him
[1:48:07] and i believe it changed her i don't
[1:48:08] think she even went back to that husband
[1:48:10] again
[1:48:11] i believe she said forget it
[1:48:13] i'm gonna follow this
[1:48:15] and she heard about somebody going in
[1:48:17] the upper room and she said i'm going to
[1:48:22] because she had representation
[1:48:25] and that representation brother ray
[1:48:26] where did it meet them at it met him in
[1:48:28] that upper room
[1:48:30] because there come a sound
[1:48:32] like a rushing mighty wind
[1:48:34] and it what filled
[1:48:37] all the people that were there
[1:48:39] they weren't full yet
[1:48:42] the bible said it filled them
[1:48:45] let's get a feeling today
[1:48:47] god bless you let's sing a song amen
[1:48:51] 281
[1:48:52] 381
[1:48:54] let's worship just for a moment
[1:48:57] i'm just a passing through
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:10] open door
[1:49:11] and i can't feel at home in this world
[1:49:16] anymore
[1:49:18] oh
[1:49:19] lord you know
[1:49:21] i have no friend like you
[1:49:24] if heaven's not my home
[1:49:31] they're gonna have to put her to sleep
[1:49:33] and do some work on her mouth so we're
[1:49:35] gonna pray right here
[1:49:36] everybody pray with us dear heavenly
[1:49:38] father
[1:49:39] in the name of jesus christ we pray that
[1:49:41] you would
[1:49:42] as this prayer cost is laid on our
[1:49:44] little granddaughter the lord that
[1:49:45] everything will be done for your honor
[1:49:46] and glory and shall come out of it just
[1:49:48] fine and everything will be well and
[1:49:49] nothing to bother anymore lord
[1:49:51] we thank you lord for these things that
[1:49:52] we're able to do this lord to bow our
[1:49:54] heads lord with this little
[1:49:56] cloth in our hand lord that we represent
[1:49:58] lord
[1:49:59] you father is going to the little child
[1:50:02] and her she'll be healed lord in the
[1:50:04] name of jesus christ amen
[1:50:07] okay
[1:50:08] no
[1:50:09] i have no friend like you
[1:50:12] if heaven's not my home
[1:50:15] then lord what will i do
[1:50:18] the angels beckon me
[1:50:21] from heaven's open door
[1:50:24] and i can't feel that home in this world
[1:50:28] anymore
[1:50:30] just over in the glory land we'll live
[1:50:34] eternally
[1:50:36] the saints on every hand
[1:50:39] are shouting while they shout because
[1:50:42] they once were sweden
[1:50:45] and now i've been transformed
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:49] feel at home in this world anymore
[1:50:54] oh lord you know
[1:50:57] i have no friend like you
[1:51:00] if heaven's not my home
[1:51:03] then lord what will i do the angels
[1:51:07] beckon me
[1:51:09] from heaven's old window
[1:51:11] and i can't feel at home in this world
[1:51:16] anymore
[1:51:18] you know that the the plan of redemption
[1:51:20] to me is just it's perfect
[1:51:22] because god thought of it
[1:51:24] amen so why do we want to mess with it
[1:51:28] we were lost
[1:51:29] somebody had to come and redeem us out
[1:51:30] of the pawnshop
[1:51:32] i was dead i was a huckleberry
[1:51:35] i didn't need somebody to tell me that
[1:51:40] i could read it in the bible
[1:51:42] that i was contrary to everything that
[1:51:43] was in his bible i was doing the
[1:51:45] contrary right
[1:51:46] right
[1:51:48] but what about the transforming power of
[1:51:50] jesus christ
[1:51:52] that'll make you a wheat
[1:51:54] put that wheat life inside of you and it
[1:51:56] doesn't matter it's like brother brown
[1:51:57] said it doesn't matter if you see the
[1:51:59] kuckelber hall
[1:52:02] if god's put wheat inside of there when
[1:52:04] you put it in the ground what a surprise
[1:52:07] the farmer will get when it comes up and
[1:52:10] it's wheat
[1:52:11] amen that's what the bible the bible
[1:52:13] says
[1:52:14] ah you look i know john you you still
[1:52:16] you just still look just like you did
[1:52:18] before now
[1:52:19] i know she don't do things you used to
[1:52:20] but you still
[1:52:22] i don't know about that
[1:52:23] don't worry
[1:52:25] don't worry
[1:52:26] listen we put many
[1:52:28] shells of cuckoo kuckerbergs in the
[1:52:29] ground
[1:52:30] but they got that wheat germ in them
[1:52:34] they'll come forth
[1:52:35] because they had representation
[1:52:38] the ones that didn't have representation
[1:52:40] they're going to have to stay
[1:52:42] in their place in their dimension
[1:52:44] for at least another thousand years
[1:52:47] but not me and you
[1:52:50] that spot of that genesis 1 26 man
[1:52:55] this world is not my home
[1:52:58] my treasures are laid up somewhere
[1:53:01] beyond the blue you know the bible tells
[1:53:03] us that we're now sitting in heavenly
[1:53:04] places do you know if you're born again
[1:53:06] your soul is in another dimension
[1:53:09] god comes in gives you the new birth
[1:53:10] never tears a thing
[1:53:12] never has to cut you open to get
[1:53:15] right
[1:53:16] but what does he change
[1:53:18] you know what the first thing he changed
[1:53:19] me he changed my thoughts
[1:53:22] because see my thoughts of drinking beer
[1:53:24] and saying bad words it just bro michael
[1:53:27] it just like a 4 inch tube it just went
[1:53:31] but when i got born again brother chris
[1:53:34] that part of me that kookaburra part
[1:53:38] don't bother me no more that doesn't
[1:53:40] bother me sure now listen
[1:53:42] some of you young ones say well no you
[1:53:44] mean you never have trouble at all no
[1:53:46] you're gonna have worse trouble
[1:53:51] but you're gonna have something to fight
[1:53:52] it with
[1:53:54] you're going to have a wheat life to
[1:53:56] fight it with because listen a cocker
[1:53:58] burr
[1:54:00] a cocklebur
[1:54:01] fights a cuckober
[1:54:03] a kuckelberg can't fight a wheat
[1:54:05] that wheat germ will win every single
[1:54:09] time
[1:54:10] because that's what god did because you
[1:54:13] mom and daddy did this and put you in
[1:54:15] this body but see god knew that
[1:54:17] sister kathy he knew right where you'd
[1:54:19] be he knew right where mary would be all
[1:54:22] your children he knew right where they'd
[1:54:23] be
[1:54:25] and one day when they cry out to god
[1:54:27] it's going to meet
[1:54:29] what god saw before the foundation of
[1:54:30] the world
[1:54:33] and then you're going to see the
[1:54:34] transforming power of god
[1:54:37] will transform you from a cuckoo bird
[1:54:39] like i said though you're going to look
[1:54:40] shell in your shell you're going to be a
[1:54:42] huckleberry
[1:54:43] because that's the way you were born
[1:54:45] can't deny that when you came you came
[1:54:47] born in sin shaped iniquity you had to
[1:54:49] stay that on the outside sister alicia
[1:54:52] but on the inside i see a wheat
[1:54:55] because it will bear the fruits of that
[1:54:57] wheat germ that's inside of you
[1:54:59] you might look that's why you and i
[1:55:01] listen
[1:55:02] read a paradox
[1:55:04] a paradox is looking at something
[1:55:07] saying that's nothing but a cuckolder
[1:55:10] but it be an eternal son and daughter of
[1:55:12] god
[1:55:13] what a paradox the world can't see that
[1:55:16] now we show as an outward expression but
[1:55:18] sometimes they'll go now i don't know
[1:55:20] about yeah
[1:55:22] there's weed inside here
[1:55:25] because you're sitting here today it
[1:55:26] proves you're weak comes in here and sit
[1:55:29] and listen for an hour and a half and
[1:55:31] listened to us just you know we don't
[1:55:33] get excited and run the benches and
[1:55:35] and
[1:55:37] and
[1:55:38] i wish we could
[1:55:39] but uh
[1:55:40] one day we will because one day you'll
[1:55:42] realize
[1:55:44] listen one more thing before we go
[1:55:47] i promise you you are special
[1:55:50] it's like sister clayton and i were
[1:55:51] talking you know brother brown said he
[1:55:53] said god's a segregationist now he was
[1:55:55] preaching this in the 60s and that was
[1:55:56] kind of hard for a man to say out in
[1:55:57] them
[1:55:58] you know in the audience when there was
[1:56:01] the black and white segregation going on
[1:56:03] he said no god's a segregationist he
[1:56:05] said
[1:56:07] he told you to come out of her my people
[1:56:09] he told you not to stay a cuckoo bird he
[1:56:11] told you not to stay in this and not he
[1:56:13] wants he told the children of israel
[1:56:15] don't you marry
[1:56:16] nowhere but inside well what's the first
[1:56:18] thing it did once they started marrying
[1:56:20] outside god left them he had to put him
[1:56:22] away because they didn't do what he said
[1:56:25] but you and i
[1:56:26] please be born again please know that
[1:56:28] you know that you know that you got the
[1:56:30] new birth and when you do then you're
[1:56:31] wheat and you can't and listen you can't
[1:56:33] change the mind of god you got to go
[1:56:36] back to that
[1:56:38] your journey down here may be
[1:56:39] kookaburras all over
[1:56:42] but if you know that you know that you
[1:56:43] know that your wheat inside
[1:56:45] when you come up
[1:56:47] when you if we have to put you in the
[1:56:49] ground or if i have to be put in the
[1:56:50] ground go downstairs and look at them 18
[1:56:52] year olds that we saw that 80 years old
[1:56:54] brother brother tatum couldn't even pick
[1:56:56] up nothing i can't do my fingers like
[1:56:58] his word you know why that's because of
[1:56:59] the kokomo on the outside
[1:57:02] but his fingers were way down here
[1:57:03] because of arthritis i'll never see that
[1:57:06] again
[1:57:07] i'll never see brother mo been over i'll
[1:57:10] never see brother george canada walking
[1:57:12] in like that's over
[1:57:15] that's done for
[1:57:17] that cuckoo bird has been put in the
[1:57:19] ground and gonna come back a week
[1:57:22] because if the spirit of him that raised
[1:57:26] up jesus from the dead
[1:57:27] dwelling you
[1:57:29] it will quicken that wheat germ
[1:57:32] that had to go on the ground because of
[1:57:33] death
[1:57:35] christians don't die
[1:57:37] we don't die
[1:57:40] no way we don't die
[1:57:41] we just move over into another dimension
[1:57:43] and let this kuckerberg life just keep
[1:57:45] going this way
[1:57:46] but when we step back into this
[1:57:48] dimension
[1:57:50] no more
[1:57:50] kookaburra all wheat germ
[1:57:53] but some of us
[1:57:55] by the transforming power of god and by
[1:57:57] the opening of the seals as brother
[1:57:58] chris was talking about we're going to
[1:58:00] get a change to the kookaburra right
[1:58:02] here
[1:58:04] standing here abraham didn't have to go
[1:58:06] in another dimension did he get a body
[1:58:08] change did he
[1:58:10] god just changed him one night and next
[1:58:12] morning he woke up and said whoa
[1:58:15] i'm in the bed with the wrong woman
[1:58:18] is she gonna look over and she said
[1:58:20] where'd abraham go
[1:58:22] no they knew god had visited them
[1:58:25] and he said i'll visit you in the time
[1:58:27] of life and he said you'll produce a son
[1:58:29] you know what abraham just went to bed
[1:58:30] and said
[1:58:31] be it unto me
[1:58:33] according to thy word and and sarah said
[1:58:36] hallelujah
[1:58:39] that's what that's the simple faith that
[1:58:40] men you've got to have right for this
[1:58:42] virus for anything anything anything
[1:58:46] just say god you said it right
[1:58:48] you visited me listen when you got the
[1:58:51] new birth you were visited by god
[1:58:54] not by a second person he didn't send a
[1:58:57] messenger when he brought the new birth
[1:58:59] he brought that thing himself
[1:59:01] he didn't send he might have give you an
[1:59:03] angel to be with you during your life
[1:59:04] but when he gave you the new birth that
[1:59:07] was him i don't think he give it to
[1:59:08] nobody else to do but himself
[1:59:11] because he said i'm going to send you a
[1:59:13] comforter
[1:59:14] which is the holy ghost which i'm going
[1:59:16] to send in my name
[1:59:19] amen
