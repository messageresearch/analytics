[0:07] okay good morning good morning
[0:10] uh
[0:11] okay
[0:12] is this one
[0:15] more right less
[0:17] yeah i think so okay let's all go the
[0:19] lord in prayer
[0:21] our heavenly father we thank you lord
[0:23] for letting us get together here today
[0:25] in your name and we pray you'll just
[0:27] come and have the preeminence and the
[0:28] service and both the services and also
[0:31] the sunday school
[0:32] just help us all to step aside and allow
[0:34] you to speak through us and
[0:36] i pray that you will uh bless brother
[0:37] wade as he's ministering
[0:40] to those that
[0:41] came up for prayer yesterday all the
[0:42] requests that were mentioned
[0:44] uh thank you for blessing us so much in
[0:46] the fellowship meeting yesterday for
[0:47] opening your word to us
[0:49] and we love you and thank you for all
[0:51] your blessings in jesus name amen
[0:55] all right
[0:58] here
[1:01] it's hard to see the mouse come over
[1:02] here
[1:06] today we're going to talk about
[1:09] sheep
[1:16] they want to talk about the comparison
[1:18] between us and she
[1:20] how that we are
[1:22] cheap in our nature okay
[1:25] uh
[1:27] this kind of goes along with some of
[1:28] what brother boss talked about last
[1:30] sunday and there was some things that
[1:31] the brother said yesterday too
[1:33] that kind of put me in mind of this same
[1:36] thing that i'm going to talk about how
[1:37] that we need to offer up our own
[1:39] thoughts and ideas to god and just have
[1:41] the mind of christ
[1:43] so that's what i really want to do is
[1:46] show show all of us how much like sheep
[1:48] we are
[1:49] so that we can really see how bad we
[1:51] need the shepherd right
[1:53] because we are in desperate need of a
[1:55] shepherd
[1:56] we have here a really good natural
[1:58] shepherd brother dale
[2:00] and of course our
[2:02] our spiritual shepherd is the lord and
[2:04] he
[2:04] leads us through brother dale
[2:06] and
[2:07] in our
[2:08] church life but then also
[2:10] in our relationships we need a shepherd
[2:13] we need a shepherd in our finances
[2:16] and we need a shepherd in everything
[2:17] that we do i think because we're born
[2:20] clueless and we're born sheep
[2:22] and
[2:23] i shoot nature so by showing you how
[2:26] sheep are and and some things that i
[2:28] studied on sheep
[2:29] hopefully it'll get you to see because
[2:31] ever since i started studying on this a
[2:32] few months ago it's kind of helped me to
[2:34] realize how much in need of i am forever
[2:39] so what got me thinking on this month
[2:43] was
[2:45] a while back i was listening to dave
[2:47] ramsey a few months ago and a woman
[2:49] called into the show
[2:51] and she wanted to start following his
[2:53] plan to get out of that everybody here
[2:54] knows about dave ramsey right
[2:56] okay
[2:58] so
[2:59] she said well dave we owe 30 000 on each
[3:02] of our cars her husband and she did
[3:05] excuse me though 20 000 and their cars
[3:08] both worth 30. so he said well if you
[3:10] sell each car
[3:12] for you know its value you have ten
[3:13] thousand dollars equity you can buy two
[3:15] paid for ten thousand dollar cars and
[3:17] here's her idea here's why she said i
[3:19] can't do that she said number one a ten
[3:21] thousand dollar car won't be safe and it
[3:23] won't be reliable
[3:25] and of course dave condemned that on the
[3:26] air in front of all the listeners said
[3:28] no no no you know a used car is plenty
[3:30] reliable and it's plenty safe enough
[3:33] but i started thinking about it oh i
[3:35] said you know that woman wasn't really
[3:36] dumb she believed like most people
[3:38] believe
[3:39] that you have to have a new car to be
[3:41] for it to be safe and for it to be
[3:42] reliable and i'm not condemning
[3:43] anybody's got new cars okay i'm just
[3:45] saying
[3:46] this is i'm you know i like new cars
[3:48] myself but i'm just saying this is what
[3:49] got me thinking on this line
[3:51] so i started thinking about well where
[3:53] down through history did that start to
[3:56] become
[3:57] an issue where did they where did
[3:59] someone start
[4:00] deceiving people to think that it was
[4:02] the car companies and i did some
[4:03] research on it and i tried to find
[4:06] evidence to back this up and i couldn't
[4:07] but this is what i expect what i think
[4:09] suspected that happened okay somewhere
[4:12] down the line somebody started saying
[4:13] well you know to have a
[4:16] a new
[4:18] a new car you'd be better off and you'd
[4:19] be safer and to be more reliable and
[4:22] especially
[4:24] with women
[4:25] you know dave ramsey talks a lot about
[4:26] how women have a safety gland
[4:28] which is metaphorical meaning that a
[4:30] woman wants to feel safe and secure so
[4:31] safety is a big issue for women so i
[4:34] started thinking well the car
[4:35] manufacturers realized that
[4:37] and some genius said well if we will
[4:40] market these cars as being safe you know
[4:42] our cars being the safest on the market
[4:44] ever sale because especially women
[4:46] really want to feel safe and secure
[4:49] and
[4:50] so
[4:51] and now every car ad that you hear or
[4:53] see
[4:54] talks about the safety of the vehicle
[4:56] right you always see this crash test
[4:58] with the dummies in there getting thrown
[4:59] into a brick wall and think well that's
[5:01] the safest car and it's so it works so
[5:04] good
[5:05] it works so good that my mom she made
[5:08] this comment to me we bought the kia
[5:10] sedona office sister susan while back
[5:12] and my mom saw that it was a kid when
[5:14] she came to look at it she said well
[5:16] ryan
[5:16] you know it's a kid
[5:18] i said yeah i knew it before i bought it
[5:21] she said well you know they don't
[5:24] perform very good in crashes and i said
[5:26] okay and what had happened is just a few
[5:28] weeks prior to that there was a bad
[5:29] break on 365
[5:31] and involving the kids the donuts was a
[5:34] suv and it rolled and somebody died but
[5:36] just because it performed kind of poorly
[5:38] it threw out in her mind that
[5:40] every kid is you know unsafe
[5:43] and she's a smart woman okay she really
[5:45] is she's an rdm and she's very
[5:47] intelligent
[5:48] but i got to think about what would make
[5:49] her think that and what makes so many
[5:51] people think that that's just one of the
[5:52] many lies that we fall for in our
[5:55] society okay
[5:56] that's just the first example okay i've
[5:58] got some better ones
[6:00] but
[6:00] uh this woman on dave ramsey's show she
[6:03] said you know if i buy this ten thousand
[6:04] dollar car in the first few months i'll
[6:06] have a ten thousand dollar shop bill for
[6:08] me breaking down all the time and that's
[6:10] a lot of silly and it'll uh and she said
[6:13] i want to be safe for my
[6:15] babies you know for my little because
[6:17] it's the mommy bear instead
[6:18] instinct kicking in wanting to watch out
[6:20] for a little bear clubs
[6:23] so granted new cars are more reliable
[6:27] and
[6:28] but really any car in this modern day is
[6:31] pretty safe in comparison to what they
[6:32] were in the 60s people got impaled by
[6:35] their steering wheel they got
[6:37] decapitated by the windshield because it
[6:39] wouldn't shatter properly so cars are a
[6:41] lot safer today
[6:42] than what they used to be
[6:44] and you know these are just some of the
[6:46] lies that have been sold to our society
[6:50] by car manufacturers and we bought into
[6:51] it because we're she that's what i'm
[6:53] saying
[6:54] so
[6:57] then i got the thing about the holocaust
[6:59] and we know about the nazis and about
[7:02] about hitler and how that he deceived
[7:05] these nazis and i didn't really research
[7:07] this a lot but i think i've heard
[7:09] somewhere along the way that he more or
[7:10] less deceived them into thinking that
[7:12] these jews
[7:13] were a lower
[7:15] life form so human
[7:17] how else could he have gotten them to
[7:19] kill these jews and mass murder as they
[7:20] did and yet these nazis were human
[7:23] beings warm blooded body spirit and soul
[7:25] just like the jews same thing
[7:28] but yet somehow hitler being a strong
[7:29] leader like he was deceived them in
[7:32] masses deceived an enormous number of
[7:34] these nazis to kill these jews that were
[7:37] also people
[7:39] and and you think they did unthinkable
[7:41] things that we could never even imagine
[7:43] doing to our fellow human beings you
[7:45] know
[7:46] so what is it about man because some of
[7:48] them nazis i mean i'm sure some of them
[7:50] had good morals and good ethics and some
[7:52] of them were fathers and husbands trying
[7:55] to be a good daddy husband and raise
[7:56] their family but for a living they
[7:58] killed people you know
[8:00] and
[8:02] in mass numbers
[8:03] and all because hitler was such a strong
[8:06] leader and he deceived them because they
[8:08] had that shield
[8:12] and then i thought about i hope they
[8:13] don't mind me bringing it up but there's
[8:15] a couple sisters that were in here one
[8:17] sunday a few months back we eat in here
[8:19] right and we eat quietly because we're
[8:21] eating and they were talking and we
[8:23] overheard them and one of their sisters
[8:25] said
[8:26] that she knows somebody in the message
[8:28] in a message church and one of these
[8:30] churches has gone off into polygamy
[8:32] and her comment was i'll see how such a
[8:35] large group of people can be so naive
[8:38] to believe that that's right and i
[8:40] thought well that's really true
[8:41] but then you think about
[8:43] all the false doctrines in the message
[8:47] and how can so many the vast majority of
[8:50] the messages deceived
[8:52] believe in especially two things that
[8:54] i've dealt with that i've had to battle
[8:56] which was jesus not being god before the
[8:58] root for jordan and coming with a
[9:00] natural seed of eternal life
[9:02] laying dormant right eternal life being
[9:04] dormant down in our soul
[9:06] and that we have it god gave it to us
[9:08] but not to our brother or sister that
[9:10] was born before us or after us
[9:12] and making god a respecter of persons
[9:14] you know how can eternal life be dormant
[9:15] and how can
[9:16] uh god be a respecter of persons he can
[9:19] but see they've been sold those lies by
[9:21] false shepherds
[9:23] and they've been sold the lie that jesus
[9:24] wasn't god
[9:26] god and flesh came down
[9:28] god and a man came down and they said at
[9:30] some point in his life before the river
[9:32] jordan he wasn't god and that he died
[9:34] just as a man he's saying well that's
[9:36] senseless how can we believe that
[9:38] it's because we're sheep all those
[9:39] things the polygamy and all the false
[9:41] doctrines
[9:42] and the message and why there are so
[9:44] many people following them is because
[9:46] we're sheep
[9:47] by nature okay and they've been deceived
[9:51] and we're not immune
[9:53] okay
[9:54] because i'll say this because you know
[9:57] even though we have a good shepherd
[9:58] that's leading us the right way we all
[10:00] believe right
[10:02] uh you know a saying can go forth from
[10:03] among some of us in the congregation or
[10:06] uh things can creep in unawares right
[10:08] that will start to cause us to go off
[10:10] and and
[10:11] in the wrong direction see because we're
[10:13] cheating we'll be misled we'll go up
[10:14] australia
[10:16] so
[10:17] uh
[10:19] those are some of the examples that i've
[10:21] been thinking about and how that
[10:24] we are in desperate need of a separate
[10:25] and we need to as sheep we need to be
[10:27] diligent too
[10:28] and try the spirits to see where they be
[10:30] of god try all this thing not just say
[10:33] just because brother dale said you know
[10:35] we need to try it for ourselves right
[10:36] and make sure on everything everything
[10:38] that we hear
[10:41] is hold up before that urine and thumb
[10:43] and see if it reflects and then
[10:49] so in these shepherds to handle our
[10:50] finances and of course i consider dave
[10:52] ramsey a financial shepherd because he
[10:55] is i believe he sent i believe that god
[10:58] has you know ordained him to or given
[11:01] laid that on his heart to bring what
[11:03] he's brought to the world and especially
[11:05] to the children of god because it's
[11:06] helped a lot of us in this church and
[11:08] self gave me not by leaps and bounds to
[11:11] take our minds and our worries off of
[11:13] our finances because we have everything
[11:15] squared away financially so we don't
[11:17] have to worry about debt we don't have
[11:19] to worry about so many things now
[11:21] and because he's a shepherd but see he's
[11:23] working through or god's working through
[11:25] him
[11:26] to bring that and i've been reading a
[11:28] good
[11:28] book here lately
[11:31] uh by emerson egrets
[11:33] about love and respect it's a good book
[11:34] about marriage and he brings from a
[11:36] scriptural standpoint
[11:38] how to you know for about scriptures
[11:41] about how wives love their husbands and
[11:43] i mean respect their husbands and
[11:45] husbands love your wives and you know
[11:47] all these things are to me are shepherds
[11:49] that god has put in place to help guide
[11:52] us as sheep
[11:53] in these different parts of our lives
[11:57] and see my mind keeps going back to the
[11:59] i think it was the last sunday school
[12:00] that i taught about wisdom
[12:02] and how that ever since we were put here
[12:05] ever since adam and eve were put here
[12:08] there was
[12:09] two trees two fountains two sources the
[12:12] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[12:14] and the tree of life
[12:15] and they've been present they've been
[12:17] available to us all down their time
[12:19] right and constantly really if you think
[12:21] about every moment of every day
[12:24] you can protect from one of those two
[12:26] trees and every nearly everything we do
[12:29] you can redeem the time and make the
[12:31] best use of your time or you can give it
[12:33] to the devil that's right and if you
[12:35] can't listen to a sermon all the time do
[12:37] what brother wade talks about he says
[12:39] that he doesn't listen that he's been
[12:40] saying here lately i don't listen that
[12:41] many sermons but while he drives those
[12:44] lawn mowers he's preaching a sermon in
[12:46] his head he's feeding on or digesting
[12:49] the things that he's heard right so we
[12:50] can think on these things as the bible
[12:53] says cast down reasonings imaginations
[12:55] the things of the world and think on
[12:57] these things and god will come to you
[12:59] and meet you in that when you do that
[13:00] sure god will absolutely meet you there
[13:02] he loves to be he loves to be present
[13:05] where he's being talked about or thought
[13:06] about
[13:07] and you know to me
[13:09] when you bring back to god
[13:11] what you see that he is
[13:14] if you just if you're listening to a
[13:15] tape and all of a sudden something
[13:16] quickens to you turn off that tape and
[13:18] start to think and more or less you can
[13:20] sit there and preach your own self a
[13:21] sermon you know and sit there and think
[13:24] well this is what i say about god he's
[13:26] that wheel in the middle of the wheel
[13:27] he's that pillar of fire and whatever
[13:29] you part of god that you're seeing
[13:30] unfolded there just start to talk back
[13:32] to god and say well lord i see this and
[13:34] i see and you can even
[13:36] just like i said i'm not a preacher but
[13:38] i'll sit there and preach a sermon in
[13:39] the chicken truck sometimes
[13:41] uh talking about what i see of god and
[13:43] not even realizing that i saw all that
[13:45] until i started to
[13:47] express it overcame by the word the
[13:49] testimony that they held you have to
[13:51] testify we receive the word
[13:54] but if you just hold it all in
[13:57] i don't know how to put it into words if
[13:59] you just hold it all in
[14:00] sometimes i guess it may be it won't
[14:02] quicken as it will if you just start to
[14:05] speak it out what you do see and then
[14:06] sort of the loose ends will start to tie
[14:08] together and you'll see you'll see a
[14:10] little bit more that's what i'm saying
[14:12] so they always thinking on these things
[14:15] and partaking of that tree of life
[14:18] of that source of godly wisdom
[14:20] and
[14:23] so those are some of the things that
[14:24] i've been
[14:25] pondering on
[14:28] okay
[14:29] um
[14:31] i guess we will go to the
[14:34] powerpoint now
[14:38] yeah
[14:39] okay
[14:44] all right sheep
[14:47] stand over here
[14:49] we are sheep ezekiel 34 31 and you my
[14:52] flock the flock of my pasture are men
[14:54] and i am your god saith the lord god
[14:58] in many instances throughout scripture
[15:00] god likens us to sheep we are all like
[15:02] sheep in our nature and are very easily
[15:05] deceived
[15:06] this is a god-given nature intended to
[15:08] make us rely on god as our shepherd
[15:10] that's my own statement okay i don't
[15:12] know how many posts about that but i
[15:14] think god made us that way so that we
[15:16] would be relying on him
[15:17] okay all right that's good
[15:20] you ever heard the statement pulled over
[15:22] your eyes
[15:23] see mankind realizes even christian or
[15:26] not everybody has come to the
[15:27] realization that we are like sheep i
[15:29] mean most people have some realization
[15:31] of that yeah because they use these
[15:32] things the grass is greener on the other
[15:34] side right yes
[15:36] over your eyes feeling sheepish
[15:39] okay that's all i have to say about that
[15:42] there are numerous similarities between
[15:44] sheep
[15:45] and humans the greatest similarity is in
[15:47] their behavior
[15:50] and here we have a man
[15:52] trying to be smart trying to sing look
[15:54] intelligent
[15:55] here we have a gentleman that knows he's
[15:57] a sheep
[15:58] he's content
[16:00] and he knows he has a paper he's not
[16:01] worried about anything he's not trying
[16:03] to be something he's not he's not trying
[16:04] to
[16:05] have his own thought coming he's just a
[16:07] sheep and he knows it
[16:09] just said what he said
[16:13] huh i said but what's he saying
[16:18] he's a sheep he's listening
[16:22] the sheet brain has many similar
[16:23] characteristics to the human brain
[16:26] though we have a much higher level of
[16:27] intelligence we are often deceived
[16:29] easily just to sheep due to our sheepish
[16:31] thinking ability
[16:35] all right the world is falling apart in
[16:36] 1963 0412 morning service the same thing
[16:40] has arrived again
[16:41] and many won't believe people won't
[16:43] believe churches won't believe no wonder
[16:45] you can't be disappointed in it because
[16:47] the bible said they wouldn't do it
[16:50] but if you individuals do this ordained
[16:52] to life look upon the fields now and see
[16:54] what power we're living in come to life
[16:57] let the life that was in christ come in
[16:59] you the mind you said oh i think i think
[17:02] this you ain't got no thought coming
[17:05] right you let the thoughts that was in
[17:07] christ be in you and that's the word
[17:09] that's right thank the thoughts that he
[17:11] thought
[17:14] okay vulnerability sheep are slow and
[17:16] clumsy which makes them vulnerable to
[17:18] predators we too are somewhat vulnerable
[17:21] and defenseless especially from a
[17:22] spiritual perspective we are clumsy and
[17:25] clueless i need a shepherd to guide us
[17:27] into all truth john 16 13 or we will
[17:30] fall prey to our predator of the devil
[17:42] jeremiah 23 will be to the pastors to
[17:44] destroy and scatter the sheep
[17:47] of my pastor saith the lord
[17:49] therefore thus saith the lord god of
[17:50] israel against the pastors that feed my
[17:52] people you have scattered my flock and
[17:54] have driven them away and have not
[17:56] visited them
[17:57] behold i will visit upon you the evil of
[18:00] your doing saith the lord
[18:02] and i will gather the remnant of my
[18:03] flock out of all the countries whether
[18:05] i've driven them i will bring them again
[18:07] to their foes
[18:09] and they shall be fruitful and increase
[18:11] and i will set up shepherds over them
[18:13] which shall feed them
[18:15] and they shall fear no more nor be
[18:17] dismayed neither shall they be like and
[18:18] say they will behold the days of
[18:20] congress saith the lord that i will
[18:22] raise
[18:23] to david a righteous branch
[18:25] and a king shall reign and
[18:27] and shall execute judgment and justice
[18:29] in the earth
[18:33] behavior
[18:34] sheep have multiple behavior traits
[18:36] similar to that of humans
[18:38] i'm not really implying anything i just
[18:40] found a picture of a man whoever that
[18:43] guy is
[18:44] that resembled that particular picture
[18:46] of that sheep that's why i put that
[18:47] there so
[18:49] i think he's your president yeah he
[18:50] could be
[18:52] gregarious which is a big word for
[18:55] sociable
[18:57] uh sheep are flock animals they tend to
[18:59] congregate close together and actually
[19:01] become stressed if they are separated
[19:03] from their flock
[19:05] they practice the principle of strength
[19:06] in numbers
[19:07] so these guys over here are comfortable
[19:09] they're happy they're in fellowship this
[19:11] gentleman here is very upset he's not
[19:13] smiling he's by himself he's stressed
[19:16] and agitated that's true and he's very
[19:19] vulnerable and that's how we are we
[19:21] separate ourselves from the flaw
[19:26] all right this is a continual reading
[19:28] about four paragraphs the good shepherd
[19:30] of the sheep 570308
[19:32] we learn a lot of things by sheep if we
[19:34] would just notice them and watch their
[19:36] actions
[19:37] and as a sheep
[19:39] a sheep is a sacrificial m a little
[19:41] innocent fellow and he's totally
[19:42] helpless when he's lost i think that's
[19:43] why jesus likened us on the sheep
[19:45] because they just can't seem to find
[19:47] their way around
[19:48] they have to depend on someone leading
[19:50] them and they cannot lead one another
[19:52] they just won't do it and that goes to
[19:54] show me one thing if we are looking to
[19:56] sheep in god's heritage
[19:58] then we cannot lead one another we are
[19:59] helpless and we've got to depend on the
[20:01] great shepherd of the sheep the lord
[20:03] jesus
[20:04] and i noticed at a slaughterhouse once
[20:06] someone was speaking to me about how
[20:07] they slaughtered the sheep and when they
[20:10] want the sheep to come out of the corral
[20:11] go up to the chute where they like where
[20:13] they kill the sheep
[20:14] the gulp leads them up there they'll
[20:16] follow the goat
[20:18] and this goat will lead them up to the
[20:19] place where the killing takes place
[20:22] and then he would jump over the side and
[20:24] let the little sheep go right on to
[20:25] their death that's the nature of the
[20:27] goat
[20:30] and if a fellow doesn't know a sheep or
[20:32] well it's hard to tell the difference
[20:33] between the bleeding of a goat and of a
[20:34] sheep they're a whole lot of life but
[20:37] the nature of them proves what they are
[20:39] that's the way with confessed christians
[20:41] and real christians the god represents
[20:43] the world that leads you right down the
[20:44] wrong road to your eternal separation
[20:47] from god
[20:48] that leads you into trouble so if we are
[20:50] sheep we better watch what kind of
[20:52] shepherd with god
[20:53] sheep are funny little creatures in one
[20:55] way here's another thing we might learn
[20:56] the sheep tonight when the weather is
[20:58] real hot did you ever see sheep they
[21:00] won't separate themselves
[21:02] and one be at one place than one another
[21:04] but right in the heat of the day the
[21:05] sheep will stand all stand together you
[21:07] know what they're doing they're making
[21:09] shade one for the other they're having
[21:11] fellowship
[21:14] uh wouldn't it be good tonight or
[21:17] wouldn't it be good if all got sheep
[21:18] when the heat was on would stand
[21:20] together when the trials are real hard
[21:22] and that he was on and everything
[21:24] going on everywhere if all those little
[21:26] sheep would just stand together
[21:28] we'd have the coolness of the shape of
[21:30] each other the comfort to lean upon each
[21:32] other
[21:33] now someone said is that necessary
[21:34] brother barron it certainly is there's
[21:36] nothing like having a real good
[21:37] dependable friend that's when the trolls
[21:39] are blazing the heat is on
[21:41] and you go to this friend and sit down
[21:43] and just explain it to them talk it over
[21:45] in personal confidence and then kneel
[21:47] down and pray together and know that
[21:49] this person is a good god-saved man or
[21:51] woman that you can put confidence in oh
[21:53] it's good to do that calm let us reason
[21:55] together save the scripture or come let
[21:57] us stand together
[21:58] and i noticed another thing when i see
[22:00] the sheep in a coal country
[22:02] when
[22:03] and when all the sheep the blizzards
[22:04] comes
[22:05] to break the wind all those little sheep
[22:07] will come
[22:08] from one side of the field to the other
[22:10] and huddle up together it keeps them
[22:12] warm it keeps each other warm
[22:14] the one from each body helps form the
[22:16] other yes
[22:19] and i think when the church gets real
[22:20] cold and indifferent dog sheep ought to
[22:23] kind of huddle up together and pray for
[22:24] each other and the warmth of real good
[22:26] christian fellowship only means so much
[22:27] david spoke of it in the first psalm
[22:29] said blessed be the man that saith not
[22:31] in the seat of this cornfield standeth
[22:32] in the way of the sinners but as the
[22:34] life is in the law of the lord and in
[22:36] the law and his law does he meditate day
[22:38] and night and it should be like a tree
[22:41] that's painted by the river of water and
[22:42] its leaves shall not wither whatsoever
[22:45] to do with it should prosper
[22:49] all right followers sheep tend to follow
[22:51] the leader whether it be a shepherd or
[22:53] another more dominant sheep
[22:55] often they'll follow another sheep even
[22:57] if doing so will result in disaster
[23:01] um
[23:03] on that same line i started to say a man
[23:04] ago that i've dealt with a couple of
[23:05] doctrines and
[23:07] those two that were most prevalent and i
[23:08] talked to one sister that goes to church
[23:11] where they believe those
[23:13] and
[23:14] she said her comment to me was this
[23:17] she said that
[23:19] if we're wrong for believing what we
[23:20] believe and what are you going to do
[23:21] with
[23:22] as you start naming off all the big
[23:24] names in the in the message
[23:26] churches that have 800 people in the
[23:28] congregation and a thousand people or so
[23:30] and
[23:31] what are you going to do with all them
[23:32] because they believe the same thing or
[23:33] they are going to help
[23:34] and i said i didn't say anything you
[23:36] know i mean i didn't say well i said i'm
[23:38] not going to say that they're wrong you
[23:39] know i just
[23:40] i didn't want to argue with her but the
[23:42] point is this
[23:44] uh the bible says straight is the gate
[23:46] and narrows the way it leads to
[23:48] righteousness the few there be the end
[23:49] of their end
[23:50] and broad is the gate that leads to
[23:52] destruction
[23:53] so if i see a lot of people doing
[23:55] something i'll balk at it and i say and
[23:57] that goes in the natural life as well as
[23:59] the spiritual that's right but if i see
[24:00] a lot of people get together doing
[24:02] something i stand back and i say hmm
[24:04] that's right is there something to this
[24:05] because just because everybody's doing
[24:07] it doesn't make it right
[24:09] and there's a lot of catholics that's
[24:10] right
[24:11] okay
[24:14] there are a ton of catholics
[24:16] that's right that doesn't make
[24:25] and led them to their death which is
[24:27] what i was just talking about
[24:30] once i find it
[24:35] it was them
[24:40] and instant bold turkey is that how you
[24:42] say it is
[24:45] turkey
[24:46] first one sheep jumped to his death then
[24:48] stunned turkish shepherds
[24:51] who had left the herd to graves while
[24:53] they had breakfast watched as nearly
[24:55] 1500 others followed each leaping off
[24:57] the same cliff
[24:59] turkish media reported in the end 450
[25:02] dead animals lay on top of one another
[25:04] in a billowy white pile
[25:06] the ascana newspaper said relax
[25:10] those who jumped later were saved as the
[25:12] pile got higher
[25:14] and the fall more cushion because
[25:15] they're all pushing out so the first 450
[25:18] or so died and the rest of them that
[25:20] jumped on top of them
[25:22] survived is because of the big pillows
[25:24] they landed on
[25:25] there's nothing we can do they're all
[25:27] wasted and this that
[25:29] anyway there's a huge loss for those
[25:30] families that lost all those sheep
[25:33] because one dominant sheep
[25:35] for whatever reason i don't remember
[25:36] they're chasing a butterfly fell off the
[25:38] edge of the cliff
[25:39] and everybody's followed
[25:41] and that's what will happen if you just
[25:43] go to following another man with his own
[25:45] idea actually exactly but we follow
[25:47] brother dale as he follows christ that's
[25:49] right same thing on brother brown
[25:51] same thing i do with dave ramsey and
[25:53] with these any sources that i draw from
[25:56] that i think are from that i know to be
[25:59] from the tree of life or from god
[26:01] ordained god
[26:02] when i see that when i hold it up to the
[26:03] word of god and it reflects that your
[26:06] thumb and it reflects
[26:08] and it matches like brother bill says
[26:09] matches my new birth experience
[26:12] then i know to follow that it's okay to
[26:14] follow that shepherd you know to protect
[26:17] from that tree that's what i'm saying
[26:19] all right
[26:20] uh
[26:21] wanderers sheep are wonders and they
[26:24] often wander into dangerous situations
[26:26] they usually walk off in search of
[26:28] better food
[26:29] they see that the grass is greener on
[26:31] the other side of the fence
[26:33] so they try to get to it likewise we
[26:36] often wander away from the past the
[26:38] pastor where our shepherd wants us
[26:40] thinking that we'll find something
[26:41] better elsewhere
[26:43] there's the green grass
[26:47] voice recognition she becomes familiar
[26:49] with the voice of their shepherd they
[26:52] learn it over time and can distinguish
[26:53] it from other voices in the same manner
[26:56] we learn the voice of our shepherd and
[26:58] another voice we will not follow john 27
[27:05] all right the lord is my shepherd i
[27:06] shall not want him he maketh me to lie
[27:08] down in green pastures he leaves me
[27:10] beside the still waters he restoreth my
[27:12] soul he leaves me in the paths of
[27:14] righteousness for his name's sake
[27:16] gather i'll walk through the valley of
[27:17] the shadow of death i'll feel fear no
[27:19] evil for thou art with me i put in
[27:21] parenthesis thy rod of correction and my
[27:23] staff guidance they comfort me
[27:26] that's what shepherds said to their
[27:28] sheep
[27:29] they correct them and then they got them
[27:31] thou prepares the table before me in the
[27:33] presence of my enemies they'll notice my
[27:35] head with all my cup runneth over surely
[27:38] goodness and mercy shall follow me all
[27:39] the days of my life don't swell in the
[27:41] house of the lord forever
[27:43] all right that's the end the class is
[27:44] not dismissed i had
[27:47] another thing
[27:52] this is a video
[27:54] of sheep
[27:56] responding to their shepherd
[27:59] i think it's in here
[28:04] freaking hilarious
[28:16] what do you want
[28:22] where do you want it
[28:25] wow
[28:27] anyone
[28:41] i'm not sure what he says in the rest of
[28:43] the video so that'll be all of that
[28:45] because i can't really make out what
[28:46] he's saying but you get the gist they're
[28:48] responding to the voice of their
[28:49] shepherd
[28:51] so that's just any video i thought
[28:53] that's good and
[28:54] any questions yeah i was thinking that
[28:57] brother brennan was talking about
[28:58] overseas somewhere where shepard was
[29:00] leaving his sheep through and he uh it
[29:03] was a
[29:04] gourmet eating area outside vendors you
[29:07] know and it had all these beautiful
[29:08] vegetables and things and he said they
[29:10] he figured that the sheep would just
[29:12] devastate the area but they just kept
[29:14] following their shepherd
[29:16] walking right past all the delicacies
[29:18] that were sitting out there yeah you
[29:21] just followed him
[29:22] any other comments or
[29:24] questions thank you for showing me who i
[29:27] am yeah
[29:28] i guess that's all
[29:30] is it too early to experience you know
[29:31] but you sit here look at each other for
[29:33] a minute
