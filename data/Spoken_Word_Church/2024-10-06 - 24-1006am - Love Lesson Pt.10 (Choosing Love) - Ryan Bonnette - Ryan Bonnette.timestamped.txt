[0:04] and I'm filling in for brother uh
[0:05] brother Bob here this morning teaching
[0:08] Sunday school
[0:10] so the last lesson I taught I've been on
[0:13] this series of Love lessons and the last
[0:15] one was on the Divine Romance just to
[0:19] summarize that lesson basically all I
[0:20] was talking about was to say that
[0:23] there's a romance uh love story if you
[0:25] will going on between Christ and the
[0:27] bride and all the elements are there and
[0:30] pointed out basically you know just to
[0:32] name a few of them this uh longing for a
[0:35] companion hope I have it plugged in good
[0:38] that Christ wanted to be revealed he
[0:40] wanted to manifest himself and reveal
[0:43] himself and he wanted just like a man uh
[0:46] wants to be you know have a wife and you
[0:49] know he wants to be a father he wants to
[0:50] be a husband um just the same way Christ
[0:53] wanted to be revealed in all of his all
[0:56] the attributes that he was
[0:58] so he that was this longing there for
[1:01] that for a companion if you will that
[1:03] was this first meeting this time when
[1:04] you first met the Lord I got that blowed
[1:06] in there
[1:08] that
[1:16] else you can try but anyway there was
[1:18] this longing for um this first meeting
[1:21] there was this attraction and falling in
[1:23] love there we go thank you brother Josh
[1:25] or whoever anyway and then this
[1:28] courtship and communion that was gifts
[1:30] we talked about last time salvation
[1:32] itself is a gift the whole entire
[1:34] Redemption plan of God is a gift to us
[1:37] from God healing is a gift word his word
[1:39] he's given us his love letter if you
[1:41] will as a gift so there's all these
[1:43] gifts the nine spiritual gifts that he
[1:45] gives us and there's also the proposal
[1:47] the engagement there's the wedding the
[1:49] future home the wedding supper the
[1:52] intimacy um you know between Christ and
[1:54] the bride so all these elements are
[1:56] there of this great love story that's
[1:57] taking place and and we're supposed to
[2:01] as we journey with the Lord in this
[2:03] great Union of this romance we're
[2:05] supposed to become stronger and deeper
[2:07] in our love for the Lord that was my
[2:09] point of last time this lesson is going
[2:12] to be on love lesson number 10 uh
[2:16] choosing love or love as a choice cuz I
[2:20] think there's kind of a misconception
[2:22] about love Hollywood kind of paints this
[2:25] picture as we'll get into
[2:28] um this kind of fairy tale image these
[2:31] are movies that I grew up with um of
[2:34] these Disney movies and I don't
[2:36] necessarily have anything against them
[2:37] I'm just saying that the the message
[2:39] they convey is Boy Meets Girl they fall
[2:42] in love love at first sight then they
[2:43] get married live happily ever after ride
[2:45] off into the sunset that same theme is
[2:48] portrayed in books and movies even to
[2:50] adults and it's like that's the end of
[2:52] the story The happily ever after but
[2:54] that's the beginning of the story when
[2:56] two people come together in a holy Union
[2:57] of matrimony that's the beginning of
[3:00] something that's supposed to last a
[3:01] lifetime and actually supposed to
[3:03] intensify and become greater the devil
[3:06] always wants you to stop things you know
[3:08] he's always trying to stop the work of
[3:09] the Lord and sort of like in a marriage
[3:12] when you come together in a holy Union
[3:14] of matrimony it's supposed to become
[3:16] greater but the devil wants you to think
[3:18] it's you're done that's it and then you
[3:20] find out it's the beginning and same
[3:23] thing with salvation you come to the
[3:24] altar you start your walk with the Lord
[3:26] or wherever you met with the Lord and
[3:29] that's not the end the devil wants you
[3:30] to think you're done now congratulations
[3:33] you go to heaven when you die but that's
[3:35] this just the beginning you're supposed
[3:36] to start this journey that lasts a
[3:38] lifetime with you and the Lord
[3:41] so just bear that in mind this slide was
[3:45] in my notes a week ago I was supposed to
[3:47] teach this last Sunday and then uh I got
[3:50] rescheduled because brother Bob couldn't
[3:52] make it you know Tennessee to preach
[3:53] brother Andre because of the flood so
[3:55] this shows you how the Lord works that
[3:58] brother Lis preached this Wednesday
[3:59] tonight it was already in my notes
[4:02] remember he was talking about how when
[4:03] you see something by Revelation you're
[4:06] supposed to grab a hold of it you know
[4:08] and be uh real assertive and not just
[4:10] kind of be uh sort of aax about it God
[4:14] wants immediate action if you love him
[4:17] throw everything else aside and take him
[4:19] if you believe his word cast everything
[4:21] else away and take his word it's a
[4:24] simple decision you have to make up your
[4:25] mind remember I'm talking about love as
[4:27] a choice so make up your mind be
[4:30] assertive be certain be absolute and
[4:32] Resolute that you're going to walk with
[4:34] the Lord and serve him the rest of your
[4:36] days the invisible Union bride he says
[4:38] separate yourself the Bible said from
[4:40] unbelief in the green there you are
[4:42] wearing the wedding band of
[4:43] predestinated unmar Grace a wedding band
[4:46] of Grace and Merit it of your own God
[4:47] did it himself he knew you before the
[4:49] foundation of the world s the wedding b
[4:51] band on you there put your name on the
[4:54] book so I'm going to go ahead and I
[4:57] mentioned I I forgot to pray before I
[4:59] start of this lesson let's go ahead and
[5:00] pray but that's the what we're going to
[5:02] be talking about dear heavely father
[5:03] pray just bless this lesson let it be a
[5:05] blessing to your people and and help to
[5:06] all those who may hear it Lord and help
[5:08] me to get the things in order that you
[5:10] want me to say I pray to be a blessing
[5:12] to them in Jesus name amen so keep in
[5:15] mind then we're talking about this whole
[5:17] lesson if I lose you in any of my
[5:18] examples all I'm saying is love is a
[5:20] choice okay this came from I think was
[5:23] an excerpt from the uh Life Bible app it
[5:27] used to be TARTA Bible app first
[5:29] Corinthians 13 and he's talking about
[5:31] what is love love is patient and kind it
[5:34] does not demand its own way love never
[5:36] gives up this famous chapter about love
[5:38] gives us one of the most eloquent
[5:40] descriptions of Love ever written love
[5:43] is a commitment and a choice of conduct
[5:46] that produces powerful feelings you say
[5:48] Ryan I want to just fall in love be
[5:50] swept off my feet and my spouse and I
[5:52] just be like you know on cloud n for the
[5:55] rest of our life yeah Cloud that cloud n
[5:57] feeling all those great feelings you
[5:59] know those come but first there's got to
[6:01] be this fundamental Foundation of real
[6:03] love as a choice that you choose to love
[6:05] that person you're committed to that
[6:07] person no matter what okay it's not
[6:10] based on what they do or how they react
[6:12] or respond it's just a simple commitment
[6:14] that you're going to love this person no
[6:16] matter what and same thing with the Lord
[6:18] when I started with the Lord at 12 I
[6:20] said I'm going to serve Jesus Christ for
[6:22] the rest of my life don't care if I live
[6:24] to be 80 or 100 I'm going to serve him
[6:26] all of my days no matter what I didn't
[6:28] promise him that I just said that I made
[6:30] that determination in myself that I'm
[6:33] going to serve the Lord all my days no
[6:35] matter what it was a commitment it was a
[6:38] choice if you practice the qualities and
[6:40] behavior described in these verses you
[6:41] will experience satisfaction and
[6:43] fulfillment Beyond imagination a great
[6:46] Rich love and feeling of love and
[6:49] infatuation comes from first having a
[6:52] real love for your spouse in this case
[6:54] I'm also talking about with the Lord you
[6:57] can take all these things that I'm
[6:58] applying to our walk with the Lord and
[7:00] really apply them to your marriage it
[7:02] does a really great thing in
[7:05] marriage there is John 15 there's no
[7:08] greater love than to lay down one's life
[7:10] for one's friends love is willing to
[7:12] sacrifice for the good of others even to
[7:14] death and then he makes the distinction
[7:16] between love versus lust 2 Samuel 13
[7:20] since he was stronger than she he raped
[7:21] her in Sly amance love turned to hate
[7:24] don't mistake Lust For Love love always
[7:28] involves commitment to the other other
[7:29] person's welfare it has that element of
[7:31] selflessness it's not about yourself
[7:34] it's about what you can do for your
[7:36] spouse and our love for the Lord is what
[7:37] we can do for
[7:40] him Jesus said remember talking about um
[7:43] I wrote this down I didn't write down
[7:44] where it was from but in one of the
[7:46] gospels he says love those who hate you
[7:48] pray for those who despitefully use you
[7:50] so that's love as a choice you choose to
[7:52] love somebody no matter what years ago
[7:55] my dad called me he was upset about one
[7:57] of our certain family members somebody
[7:58] that married into our our family and had
[8:01] um um had caused some problems in our
[8:03] family and my dad was all upset and I
[8:05] was too it was burdensome to us all as a
[8:07] family but I said dad you know what he's
[8:09] part of our family I'm going to love him
[8:11] cuz I choose to no matter what he does
[8:13] I'm going to love him no matter what and
[8:16] sometimes the Lord lets us go through
[8:17] hard times he knows what's best we don't
[8:20] understand we don't question him we just
[8:22] say Lord I love you I'm G to serve you
[8:24] no matter what when we thought IA was
[8:26] fixing to die a few years ago she was so
[8:28] close to death we came to church anyway
[8:31] and uh in essence what I was doing is
[8:33] showing the Lord I'm going to serve you
[8:34] no matter what and that example has been
[8:37] made here by all these so many widows
[8:39] and widowers who keep coming to church
[8:41] and serving the lord though God take
[8:43] away the most important thing to them in
[8:45] this world they keep on Faithfully
[8:47] coming and serving the lord amen so we
[8:49] have that example over and over again in
[8:51] our
[8:53] midst so I'm going to emphasize a little
[8:57] bit about um predestin ation here in a
[9:00] moment because some things opened up to
[9:02] me recently through what's been
[9:04] preached and there again goes back to
[9:06] Choice um by the way if you don't have
[9:09] this book and you're married please get
[9:12] this book it's from I think their name
[9:14] is the Kendrick Brothers they're in
[9:16] Athens Georgia I believe is where
[9:18] they're from but gab and I read this
[9:19] book over you know a time or two and
[9:22] it's it's really really rich um love is
[9:26] unconditional it's a choice
[9:28] unconditional love is a choice God
[9:30] demonstrates his love toward us and that
[9:32] while we're yet sinners Christ died for
[9:34] us how unlovable were we as Sinners yet
[9:37] Christ died for us he did the the the
[9:39] most wonderful Act of love he could have
[9:42] possibly done Romans 5 there in the
[9:45] Highlight the only way love can last a
[9:47] lifetime if it's if it's unconditional
[9:50] the truth is this love is not determined
[9:52] by the one being led but rather by the
[9:54] one choosing to love the Bible refers to
[9:56] this kind of love by using the Greek
[9:57] word Agape which we well familiar with
[10:00] ILO and iros are more responsive in
[10:03] nature and can fluctuate based on
[10:06] feelings Agape Love on the other hand is
[10:09] selfless and unconditional so unless
[10:12] this kind of love forms the foundation
[10:13] of your marriage the wear and tear of
[10:15] time will destroy it Agape Love is in
[10:18] sickness and in health love for richer
[10:20] or for poorer Love For Better or For
[10:22] Worse love it's the only kind of love
[10:25] that is true love that's because it's
[10:27] God's kind of love he doesn't love us
[10:30] because we are lovable but because he is
[10:32] so loving the Bible says in this is love
[10:35] not that we loved God but that he loved
[10:37] us and sent his son to be the
[10:39] perpetuation for our sins 1 John 4 if he
[10:42] insisted that we prove ourselves worthy
[10:44] of his love we would fail miserably but
[10:47] God's love is a choice he makes complete
[10:49] on his own it's something we receive
[10:51] from him then we share with others we
[10:54] love because he first love US 1 John 4
[10:56] if a man says to his wife I've fallen
[10:58] out of love with you it's actually
[10:59] saying I never loved you unconditionally
[11:02] to begin with his love was based on
[11:04] feelings or circumstances rather than
[11:05] commitment that's the result of building
[11:08] a marriage on filio or Eros love there
[11:12] must be a stronger Foundation than mere
[11:13] friendship or sexual attraction
[11:15] unconditional love agape love will not
[11:18] be swayed by time or
[11:21] circumstance
[11:22] so this is
[11:24] a a really important quote that brother
[11:27] Bob made two Sunday ago it was his
[11:30] closing comment on his Sunday school
[11:32] lesson and it was explosive to me this
[11:35] goes all the way back to 2007 there were
[11:38] two doctrines so prominent in the
[11:39] message that brother Dell had presented
[11:42] to us and said this is the one side this
[11:43] is the other side you you know basically
[11:45] he said you choose but um he he made it
[11:50] clear his his stand on him you know when
[11:52] it looks like there is a contradiction
[11:54] in the message or in the Bible it's not
[11:56] a contradiction it's your lack of
[11:58] Revelation
[11:59] and a revelation ties the two apparent
[12:01] different sides together so you see you
[12:04] can take these quotes over here and
[12:05] those quotes over there and tie them
[12:06] together by Revelation I was riding
[12:09] pastor's coattail I didn't have that
[12:10] Revelation and when it came down to it
[12:12] where the rubber meets the road I had to
[12:13] make a decision what do I believe about
[12:15] these two doctrines because it looked
[12:17] like I could see both sides and I begged
[12:19] God for Revelation but he didn't give it
[12:21] right then I had to wait and wait 2007
[12:26] little by little over the years until
[12:27] now it EXP exploded two Sundays ago and
[12:31] I saw it more clearly than I've ever
[12:33] seen it from this comment from Brother
[12:34] Bob he makes this distinction so
[12:38] important really really study this for a
[12:40] moment from what is the genan seed part
[12:42] two you as an individual you ain't
[12:45] nothing without the word it's the word
[12:48] the Eternal thought the attribute that
[12:50] God thought of before the foundation of
[12:52] the world God knew that one day you
[12:55] would hear that word and the word would
[12:57] drop down into your heart and that would
[13:00] be predestinated eternally he's making a
[13:02] distinction between a sinner and then a
[13:05] born again person
[13:08] okay when the word drops into your heart
[13:11] then now you're caught up into what God
[13:14] thought of and now you continue that
[13:15] along that trajectory so we can say that
[13:18] it's the seed word that comes
[13:19] predestinate eternally but when that
[13:21] seed lives in a person the person is
[13:23] part of God's plan and you're caught up
[13:25] into the Eternal brother Wade calls that
[13:27] genesis6
[13:29] um and this is my the red there is just
[13:31] something I said believe what you can't
[13:33] see until your faith becomes sight so
[13:37] keep believing what you do see walk in
[13:38] the light that you see for for right now
[13:40] but beg God for Revelation because he'll
[13:43] reveal it in his time if you don't see
[13:44] what I just said quoting from Brother
[13:46] Bob just keep praying and ask God to
[13:47] reveal it and it might take 20 years you
[13:49] know or 15 years but God will show you
[13:51] in his time here's the problem that I
[13:53] see and I'm not condemning ministers I
[13:55] don't think they mean to do this but
[13:57] they kind of throw out these blanket
[13:58] statements of congregation you know kind
[14:00] of mixed Congregation of you know he
[14:02] always was eternal in these quotes from
[14:03] brother bham and and and then people who
[14:06] maybe are still Sinners maybe haven't
[14:07] come to the Lord yet you know start to
[14:09] say well maybe I always was eternal and
[14:11] I just needed to hear the word and word
[14:13] crossed my path and I just came to life
[14:15] all of a sudden you know but you know
[14:16] you're trying to bypass God's plan his
[14:18] plan is repent and start your walk with
[14:21] the Lord get saved get born again and
[14:23] keep walking with the Lord come through
[14:24] sanctification and then you're being
[14:26] caught up to that part that's
[14:27] predestinated because the word seed
[14:29] found you it will find you it can't not
[14:31] find you the word of God comes
[14:33] predestinate eternally to find you it
[14:35] will find you wherever you're at and
[14:36] I'll show you that as an example if I
[14:39] have time brother banon is the one that
[14:40] said this predestination is a bad word
[14:42] for minister to use before an untrained
[14:43] congregation well we're trained you know
[14:46] brother Dell made it really plain in
[14:47] teaching us what predestination is and
[14:49] so we know what predestination is and
[14:52] that is based on choice right the whole
[14:55] thing I'm talking about today is choice
[14:57] you choose God over everything else but
[15:00] make a real firm choice not a one-time
[15:03] choice but a daily Choice every day
[15:06] several times a day every time you open
[15:08] your Bible you're making a choice every
[15:11] time you get down before God and pray
[15:13] you're making a choice every time you
[15:14] meditate on his word you're making a
[15:15] choice and you're choosing Christ over
[15:17] and over throughout your day not just
[15:19] one time I said it and I'm done and I'm
[15:21] going to heaven when I die I've Got My
[15:22] Ticket No it's a it's a daily thing
[15:28] [Applause]
[15:29] okay so question and answers uh brother
[15:32] Banner says predestination is a bad word
[15:33] for Minister youth for an untrained
[15:35] congregation see I don't use it
[15:36] sometimes here at the church but when
[15:39] out in the audiences in the big where
[15:40] everything is piled in from everywhere I
[15:42] watch that word I always use the word
[15:44] for knowledge because predestination is
[15:46] only for knowledge of God God being
[15:49] infinite by for knowledge he knew
[15:51] everything or he is an infinite he knew
[15:54] what would happen so by for knowledge he
[15:55] could predestinate that's the reason I
[15:57] believe God that God doesn't just
[15:59] so he looks at our choice he knew what
[16:02] we would choose and that one day we want
[16:03] it more than anything not that we would
[16:05] just choose it one time but then never
[16:06] come to church again not that we choose
[16:08] it one time and that we'd come to church
[16:10] and maybe try to live by code of rules
[16:12] and maybe be good but that we'd be
[16:14] fervent and on fire for God and that's
[16:16] the kind of choice I'm talking about
[16:19] making so the signs of his coming what
[16:21] is a lie it's a truth perverted it was
[16:23] actually the truth and somebody misquote
[16:25] it made it a lie the serpent um I put
[16:28] that in there the serpent what is a
[16:29] wrong thing it's a right thing perverted
[16:31] everything the devil cannot create
[16:33] nothing and everything that's wrong the
[16:35] devil perverted what was right to make
[16:37] it wrong and if there's a real world
[16:38] real word of God there's a so-called
[16:41] word of God that's false so close to the
[16:43] truth like I said I don't think I'm not
[16:44] condemning ministers for St here and
[16:46] throwing that blanket statement out you
[16:47] always was eternal just believe God you
[16:49] know I'm not condemning them for doing
[16:51] that I don't think they mean any harm by
[16:52] it but for years I struggled with that
[16:54] cuz I could see it looked like they were
[16:56] saying that I didn't even need to get BN
[16:59] again in the first place like I just saw
[17:00] it and always was so there's false
[17:02] prophets as some as there's true
[17:05] prophets but the true Prophet how you
[17:06] mark him he will stay with the word
[17:09] always okay this this brother Dell my
[17:12] paraphrase the best that I can remember
[17:13] how he said this the spirit not
[17:14] something so easy to receive that we
[17:16] just breathe it in paraphrasing brother
[17:18] Dale the Holy Ghost is not something we
[17:20] just fall into nor is it something so
[17:22] hard that one cannot attain to it God's
[17:25] spirit comes by God's process the new
[17:27] birth
[17:29] right right so it's your choice brother
[17:32] Bon says and question answers uh they so
[17:35] they went down in this beautiful Rebecca
[17:37] come out in the water and prayed and
[17:39] watered the camels and whatever more and
[17:41] then you'll notice Rebecca and the final
[17:44] Choice had to come to Rebecca he asked
[17:46] the father for the girl and he asked the
[17:48] mother sorry didn't me H that for the
[17:50] mother for the girl and they neither one
[17:53] could agree wanted to say stay for a
[17:55] while he said don't hinder me on my work
[17:57] and Rebecca had to make the choice cuz
[18:00] he said she is the ma let her make the
[18:02] choice and as soon as it was made her
[18:05] quickly her mind was made up she said
[18:07] I'll go she mounted upon her camel went
[18:09] to meet look the very camel she watered
[18:11] was the camel that packed her to her
[18:13] bridegroom and all of her success and
[18:15] the Very camel the power of the beast in
[18:17] the Bible represents power and the Very
[18:19] power that we give water and praise to
[18:22] Water of Life praise to the word is the
[18:24] very thing that packs us into glory land
[18:26] to meet the
[18:27] bridegroom that's right
[18:29] this is Brother Luis a couple months ago
[18:31] uh June 24th he was preaching on the
[18:33] Lord is
[18:34] peace you're not here at this moment
[18:37] amen just by because by accident and
[18:40] nothing that has happened in the last
[18:42] few years has happened by
[18:44] accident it was the plans of
[18:47] God so we can rest on that amen the
[18:50] vents in our lives are not surprises but
[18:53] they are expected by God because they're
[18:56] what he seen as part of predestination
[18:58] amen praise the Lord
[19:00] Jesus I'm talking about your journey and
[19:03] I'm going to talk for a moment about
[19:05] Gabby's Journey so you kind of take this
[19:07] and maybe I guess you say transpose it
[19:08] to your life and think of how God
[19:11] brought you on the way that he brought
[19:13] you how did he get you here CU that's
[19:15] where I see predestination most clearly
[19:18] that I was a sinner and I was raised a
[19:20] Baptist came to the Lord but I was still
[19:23] far from where I needed to be how on
[19:24] Earth was I going to get in this church
[19:27] even in the message in general how was
[19:28] was I going to get here without some
[19:30] plan of God that the word cross my path
[19:32] and sister gwy Silas would give me a
[19:33] church age book say God sent a prophet
[19:35] and I'd say what's a church age you know
[19:38] and I just started there and started
[19:39] asking questions and probing and seeking
[19:42] God and praying for
[19:44] Revelation Gabby as you see here on the
[19:46] left at 16 about 16 years old her name
[19:49] was Jesse Martin was her given name she
[19:51] was in the uh you know she was a foster
[19:54] kid an orphan if you
[19:56] will and in her journey at the beginning
[19:59] of it she was far away from the Lord
[20:01] just a sinner she grew up in and out of
[20:03] a lot of churches and all those foster
[20:04] homes then on the right you see here a
[20:07] Godly Christian lady that look she
[20:10] didn't just make a choice and just say I
[20:12] going to serve the
[20:13] Lord she sits up till 2: in the
[20:16] morning listening to these sermons from
[20:19] these ministers from Brother Wade
[20:20] brother Aaron Brother Bob brother Luise
[20:22] our ministers till 2
[20:24] am I'm not saying you need to do that
[20:27] you do it works for you right brother
[20:29] Bob does it working in the yard he used
[20:31] to do it on MAR bus and Mar train you
[20:32] able to weit on the lawn mower now he
[20:34] does it delivering mail you do whatever
[20:36] works for you in your life I have my way
[20:38] it works for me you find where you can
[20:40] meet with God but for her personally she
[20:42] sits up till 2: a.m. listening to
[20:44] sermons she's got to get up at 5:00 a.m.
[20:47] and get four kids ready for school cuz
[20:49] I'm at work all night and most of the
[20:50] day I'm not there at all she's basically
[20:52] a single mom raising four kids herself
[20:55] pretty much cuz I'm at work
[20:59] is that a choice is that fervent is that
[21:02] what you call adamant about serving the
[21:04] lord so she loves this so much she's
[21:06] willing to give her sleep up for it
[21:08] that's what I'm talking about being
[21:09] desperate that's a choice for Christ I'm
[21:12] not trying to make anything of her I'm
[21:13] just trying to show you an example now
[21:15] she that's the end result of where she
[21:17] is today in her journey that God knew
[21:19] she wanted it so bad that she'd do that
[21:22] she give up her life her sleep for this
[21:25] for the message for the word of God she
[21:27] wants it so bad not just a casual choice
[21:30] I just say yeah Lord I'll serve if you
[21:32] ask any old sinner will you serve the
[21:33] Lord I guess you know yeah I'll serve I
[21:35] guess I want to be in heaven yeah I'm
[21:36] not talking about that I mean a real
[21:38] fervent
[21:39] Choice and then over here on this side
[21:41] she's a sinner how on Earth is God going
[21:44] to get her from there to there and he do
[21:46] he didn't sit back and ring his hands
[21:48] and say how am I going to do this I
[21:50] don't know what I'm going to do no he
[21:51] had a predestinated plan just for her
[21:54] catered just to her he knew exactly what
[21:56] he needed to do so he said
[21:59] I'm going to send Arley and
[22:01] Sharon and these message parents that
[22:04] love kids and adopt kids into their home
[22:07] and they weren't wanting another girl
[22:09] they wanted a boy so they came to this
[22:11] picnic one day and I told the story
[22:13] briefly before they came to the picnic
[22:15] where these kids orphans come to meet
[22:19] potential adoptive parents and he they
[22:22] came there and they said we want to
[22:23] adopt a boy they had their mind already
[22:25] on this certain boy so they went they
[22:26] took a picture of this boy they got to
[22:28] meet the boy boy but they also talked to
[22:30] Gabby and her sister Jackie um and they
[22:34] weren't thinking about adopting him they
[22:36] took a picture of the boy that went home
[22:38] and had it had it developed and in the
[22:40] picture was Jackie and Gabby but they
[22:44] were out of the frame when the picture
[22:45] was taken that's what I'm talking about
[22:48] predestination that's a part of
[22:49] predestination where God said my word
[22:52] has got to get to that girl somehow
[22:55] because I know she wants it more than
[22:56] anything so I'm going to get a to her
[22:58] whatever it takes even if that camera
[23:01] has to pick up something not in the
[23:02] frame so they did that they got home
[23:05] they said maybe the Lord wants us to
[23:06] adopt those two girls instead of this
[23:09] boy so they did they adopted those two
[23:11] girls in the middle of there Gabby is on
[23:14] the kind of left Center and Jackie on
[23:16] the right they adopted those two girls
[23:18] they already had enough girls they had
[23:20] PL plenty of girls so predestinate
[23:23] Journey Jeremiah 29:11 for I know that
[23:25] thoughts that I think toward you say the
[23:27] Lord thoughts of peace and not of you
[23:28] able to give you an expected end he
[23:29] knows exactly how to get you from point
[23:32] A to point B if you just desire it
[23:34] that's all if you really want it he
[23:35] knows how to get you there but do you
[23:37] really want it do you want more than
[23:38] life itself more than anything more than
[23:40] your next breath more than sleep more
[23:42] than anything you have to really want
[23:44] God it's not a casual just make a choice
[23:49] then shall you call upon me and you
[23:50] shall know you shall go and pray unto me
[23:52] and I will hearken unto you and you
[23:54] shall seek me and find me when you shall
[23:56] search with for me with all of your
[23:58] heart and I'll be found of you he how
[24:01] could he not let you find him if you're
[24:03] looking and you're really digging and
[24:04] you're searching and you're seeking what
[24:06] kind of God would just shun you and push
[24:09] you away say no I'm not going to let you
[24:10] find me he'll find he'll let you find
[24:12] him and he'll come and he'll meet you
[24:14] there you just keep waiting and praying
[24:16] and seeking him with all of your heart
[24:18] and I will be found of you say the Lord
[24:20] and I will turn away your captivity and
[24:23] I will gather you from all the nations
[24:24] from all the places where I've have
[24:25] driven you sayith the Lord and I will
[24:27] bring you again to the place I cause you
[24:29] to be carried away
[24:30] captive I'm going to close a few minutes
[24:33] early because I know we have a lot to do
[24:34] today so just uh falling in love with
[24:37] the Lord is in the same way takes
[24:39] reading the Love Letter listening to
[24:40] sermons meditating
[24:42] praying Real Love Is by choice it
[24:44] produces
[24:45] feelings we have feelings for the Lord
[24:48] no doubt we have strong feelings for the
[24:49] Lord but that's to me kind of like the
[24:51] side note you know and in marriage we
[24:53] have feelings we have strong infatuation
[24:56] but there's got to be something more
[24:57] firm than that I'll just give a couple
[25:00] more slides here about this um what I
[25:02] was talking about a minute ago beware of
[25:05] uh Matthew 7 beware of false prophets
[25:06] which come to you and sheep's clothing
[25:08] inwardly they are ravening wols you
[25:09] shall know them by their fruits brother
[25:11] the B called that Doctrine you know the
[25:12] what a minister preaches is fruit so do
[25:16] men gather grapes with thorns or figs
[25:17] with thistles even so every good tree
[25:20] bringeth forth good fruit but a crup
[25:21] tree brings forth evil fruit all I'm
[25:23] saying in this is when making your
[25:25] choice about what you believe about
[25:27] Doctrine things listen carefully to a
[25:28] minister and weigh it out in your mind
[25:30] you can't just take it because he's a
[25:32] big name preacher and just assume it's
[25:33] all right and and maybe sometimes we
[25:36] just misunderstand ministers about
[25:38] certain things but uh uh going on down
[25:41] there to the definition of Strong's
[25:43] false prophets is one who acting the
[25:46] part of a divinely inspired Prophet
[25:47] utters falsehoods under the name of
[25:49] divine prophecies these things come so
[25:51] close to the truth uh the musicians if
[25:54] you will go ahead make your way up here
[25:55] please and then from anointed ones
[25:57] brother B said what is fruit the word
[25:59] for the fruit for the season that's what
[26:01] it is their teaching the teaching of
[26:03] what the teaching of the Season what
[26:06] time it is man's Doctrine denominational
[26:08] Doctrine but or of God's word of the
[26:10] season when you hear things preached no
[26:13] matter how good it sounds or how how
[26:15] good maybe it's a feel-good Doctrine
[26:17] weigh it out in in your mind and pray
[26:19] and ask God for Revelation walk in the
[26:21] truth because it is is so important to
[26:23] keep right on the truth it's your choice
[26:25] though at the end of the day what you
[26:26] believe and what you follow is your
[26:28] choice and choose Christ Above All Else
[26:31] serve him with all of your
[26:34] heart
[26:35] and the scripture says 1 John 4 try the
[26:38] spirits see where they be of God because
[26:40] and I'm talking about spirits in this
[26:42] case as Doctrine because many false
[26:45] prophets are gone out into the world
[26:46] hereby know you the spirit of God every
[26:47] spirit that confess Jesus Christ is come
[26:49] in the flesh is of God every spirit that
[26:51] confesses Jesus not come Christ is I'm
[26:54] sorry every spirit that confesses not
[26:57] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[26:58] is not of God that that Spirit of
[27:00] antichrist it's so close to the truth
[27:03] just beg God for Revelation and put God
[27:05] first in all that you do I'm going to go
[27:06] aead and close there God bless you thank
[27:08] you
[27:12] [Applause]
