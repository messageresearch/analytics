[52:29] word of god hallelujah but we begin to
[52:31] look at this scripture right here in the
[52:32] beginning how that everything started
[52:35] right here started from the book of
[52:37] genesis hallelujah i don't care how you
[52:39] get it if you're going to get anything
[52:41] from god you've got to go back to
[52:42] genesis how if you could if you can get
[52:45] a revelation what happened in genesis
[52:47] how do you do you could see the whole
[52:48] thing the whole revelation opened up i
[52:51] know i don't care where you come or
[52:52] where you start you start from genesis
[52:55] and it'll bring you'll always see it all
[52:57] the way through the bible hello by the
[52:59] grace of god but god how do we realize
[53:01] here and why why did god want to use
[53:03] genesis in him
[53:05] in the beginning god created the heavens
[53:07] and the earth holy was nothing up it was
[53:10] nothing now one time it was just
[53:12] darkness there was nothing moving here
[53:14] with no life there but holly but god
[53:16] spoke
[53:17] how he spoke the word of god let there
[53:20] be light
[53:21] and light came here in hell i want to
[53:23] tell you people about them almighty god
[53:24] that's the only way we could ever get
[53:26] saved that's the only way we can get
[53:27] delivered from anything you got to hear
[53:29] the word of god
[53:31] this word this i'm telling people this
[53:33] word is supernatural honey if you try to
[53:35] if you call yourself i believe god and
[53:38] you don't believe the supernatural it
[53:40] ain't gonna work for you how you gonna
[53:41] read it you could talk and you could say
[53:43] i can believe it holy but when it come
[53:45] when that revelation come flush that
[53:47] when it come real how did people realize
[53:49] here today we realized that god wanted
[53:52] us to come to that revelation of the
[53:53] word coming real real flesh with it how
[53:56] does god want flesh on him but we want
[53:59] to take for a title there the tree of
[54:01] life
[54:03] that was predestinated to die
[54:07] on the tree
[54:08] i said he was predestinated to die hey
[54:11] you said brother you say why you say bro
[54:13] why are you saying god he had a purpose
[54:15] in his mind he didn't he has a secret in
[54:17] his mind how he didn't tell it to nobody
[54:20] but he started with the he started with
[54:22] the tree and he said well if the tree
[54:24] and the guardian the good and evil i did
[54:27] so that was a fight started from there
[54:29] hey that fight started in heaven
[54:31] hallelujah started in that he kicked him
[54:33] out how did that that was a war star
[54:35] today but it started on earth here and
[54:37] he had two god he had two trees there
[54:40] the good and evil
[54:42] and that's where the stars start right
[54:43] there and that way but he had something
[54:45] in his mind that he was going to make
[54:47] known to the bride or make towards his
[54:49] brother to his bride here it was
[54:51] something that i'm going to get rid of
[54:52] this devil i'm going to get rid of all
[54:54] the power of the devil how the people we
[54:56] fight you say brother this is the edge
[54:58] right here you better know that you've
[54:59] got the holy ghost hey you better know
[55:01] where you stand in the revelation here
[55:03] because this devil is not playing today
[55:05] how this world is falling apart demonic
[55:07] spirits are rolling all over the place
[55:09] how little people are by the power of
[55:11] god these spirits trying to get rid of
[55:13] the bride they try to get rid of
[55:15] everybody satan don't care nothing about
[55:17] being he he don't care nothing about me
[55:19] he want to get rid of everybody he
[55:21] rushed he could kill every man on this
[55:22] earth he wished he could send every man
[55:25] to hell but i'm going to tell you what
[55:26] he said a group of people cannot touch
[55:28] there's a group of people cannot touch
[55:31] it's the one that got the blood of jesus
[55:33] christ in them how did he knows that
[55:35] right here now i'm gonna let go because
[55:37] i'm getting another word by god grace
[55:38] i'm name gonna try to follow these notes
[55:40] i'm gonna try to get the holy ghost to
[55:42] preach hallelujah you know you can say a
[55:44] few things in your own self but when he
[55:46] take over that what makes a difference
[55:48] right here when he when he want to do it
[55:50] now i want him let him do it by the
[55:51] grace of almighty god here so we
[55:53] realized so it started right there in
[55:55] the garden of eden hallelujah when the
[55:57] time before all that's happened you
[55:59] realize before the devil sin was on the
[56:01] earth how we would we how would we be if
[56:03] we lived in our earth well there was no
[56:06] sin here
[56:07] how did you say what you said how you
[56:09] hiding what
[56:10] what would be the thing if there was no
[56:12] sin here how would the people be acting
[56:14] what would they do i would say i will be
[56:16] acting we'll be acting young
[56:18] i think wouldn't be no old people
[56:20] wouldn't be no ball headed people here
[56:21] neither everybody had all teeth in their
[56:23] head and everything that that's what
[56:25] happened we would if we were no sin here
[56:27] we would have no problem how little
[56:29] people you talk about you that blood
[56:31] jewel you said how are you that i well i
[56:33] just can't even think how would a world
[56:35] be with no sin in it but i would tell
[56:37] you what we are we are people say we got
[56:39] to deal with the spirit but how did it
[56:41] get this away because one woman got out
[56:44] of blair she got out of the way she got
[56:46] it in listen to the wrong thing and went
[56:48] down that would cause the problem
[56:51] that was the trouble star day right
[56:52] there and it's going to keep on starting
[56:54] right here the bible says a woman that's
[56:56] born a man is full of days and trouble
[56:58] here don't just don't put it on her but
[56:59] i'm sure that was scary today
[57:02] and that's what we got to deal with and
[57:03] that's why that wasn't the thing so now
[57:05] we need a earthquake how did all these
[57:07] things all these things here that that
[57:09] we go against today all the walls and
[57:11] everything it come from one thing
[57:13] because one person let down the word of
[57:15] god how they let one word let down one
[57:17] word was broke and then the man began to
[57:20] become weird become to come under the
[57:23] influence of demonic spirit now we got
[57:25] to deal with this thing every day you go
[57:27] to work everywhere you go you got to
[57:29] fight your spirit that way you go every
[57:30] time you go shopping you got to watch it
[57:32] somebody want to kill you somebody want
[57:34] to do something how many days one day
[57:36] but by god grace the devil cannot do
[57:38] nothing to you until you got god can't
[57:40] do with you i don't care i'm in the
[57:41] spirit of fight god taking over this
[57:44] world right here by the power of the
[57:45] holy ghost
[57:47] by god grace get what he wanted to do he
[57:49] want to get us under the spirit of fear
[57:50] because he get free enough holy people i
[57:52] told today i said you know you know we
[57:54] were riding down the road and and that

[1:14:08] worm didn't he he didn't work you know
[1:14:10] what he could have died and he could
[1:14:12] have went to the grave and worm but he
[1:14:14] didn't have none
[1:14:15] he was perfect buddy he had a perfect
[1:14:17] body even though that body was going to
[1:14:19] be how did he get sin and he had to eat
[1:14:21] food
[1:14:22] food build body and build that so he
[1:14:25] didn't eat anywhere so you know what he
[1:14:27] knew what that's why he didn't know god
[1:14:29] had to come to clear revelation high
[1:14:32] field to be a man
[1:14:33] how did he wanted to know how it feels
[1:14:35] to be a man how did it because how did
[1:14:37] god make intercession for the world
[1:14:39] because he knew how yet feel for a
[1:14:41] sinner to go he know when you're going
[1:14:43] through your word he know when you're
[1:14:44] going through the demonic power he know
[1:14:46] where you're going to
[1:14:48] almost run and kill yourself the only
[1:14:50] thing that goes through their mind he
[1:14:51] knows how to deal for you he know how to
[1:14:54] pay for you that way he had to go there
[1:14:56] he'd come and show up hallelujah how to
[1:14:58] overcome
[1:15:00] the power of god teaching us how to
[1:15:02] overcome in his age how did it so we he
[1:15:04] goes there you know where he was born
[1:15:07] and he was born a baby
[1:15:09] a baby but even in a baby he was in
[1:15:12] supreme control of everything now he
[1:15:15] might not realize you know god knew all
[1:15:17] things but some things that god did even
[1:15:19] in the flesh here
[1:15:21] in the flesh here he had he
[1:15:24] he began to realize
[1:15:26] he began to get he began to recognize
[1:15:28] something different he was supernatural
[1:15:31] he could not he could not undermine we
[1:15:33] didn't he had the bible say he had to
[1:15:35] learn how he had
[1:15:37] and everything like that so he what he
[1:15:39] did he began to begin to walk and he
[1:15:42] began to realize the power of god when i

[1:21:36] ain't got power i want to tell you he
[1:21:37] got a lot of power we didn't learn how
[1:21:39] to submit to it you'll see the power of

[1:21:53] god god needs you to trust him every way
[1:21:55] people you gotta hold on to the word of
[1:21:57] god
[1:21:58] hallelujah then he did him
[1:22:00] but we realized that so after he done
[1:22:02] these things right here began to come
[1:22:04] closer and closer to the flesh
[1:22:06] he been trying to come close to the
[1:22:08] flesh god didn't become in the flesh
[1:22:10] well hallelujah he came on you now
[1:22:12] you're walking on that earth you know
[1:22:14] how he living as a man like me and you
[1:22:16] eating like me and you eating fighting
[1:22:18] the same bottle that we fight every day
[1:22:20] here but he had a purpose for doing it
[1:22:22] if he had a purpose and he had something
[1:22:24] that he didn't know that nobody know he
[1:22:26] had a purpose and that wasn't in that
[1:22:28] body jesus christ went one of the most
[1:22:30] demonic fighting him more than any man
[1:22:32] like you ever seen don't you think that
[1:22:34] he had a heart that he had to eat look
[1:22:36] at it when he got when he got ready he
[1:22:38] was on the up on that
[1:22:40] out there in the desert he went to a
[1:22:42] great battle right he went to a great
[1:22:44] battle like no man ever went through he
[1:22:45] would tell him fight him by his mind
[1:22:47] fight him hard too if that be
[1:22:50] the man hungry when a man get hungry
[1:22:53] he'll do anything but probably god said
[1:22:54] man hungry enough he eat out of garbage
[1:22:56] cans i didn't know what but he that's
[1:22:59] how you do it he was he was dying and
[1:23:01] then jesus the devil came to say if not
[1:23:03] be now like he's trying to make him
[1:23:05] doubt
[1:23:06] trying to make him doubt who he is how
[1:23:08] did he know that he said he said if not
[1:23:11] be the son of god command that this
[1:23:12] stone be made of brilliant you say that
[1:23:15] come on you can't do no bad net devil
[1:23:18] all he had to do was pick up a rock and
[1:23:19] say bread it could have been bred all
[1:23:21] over the earth i believe by god he could
[1:23:23] have done that
[1:23:24] but he he would not come in the
[1:23:26] glorified for the devil he come to the
[1:23:28] glory of god how did he say without he
[1:23:30] said he told anything he said
[1:23:33] man should not live by bread alone by
[1:23:35] every word but see now the mouth of god
[1:23:37] and that broke the power of the devil
[1:23:38] then the devil said oh i got to try you
[1:23:40] again boy and the devil turned around
[1:23:42] and brought him to try to get him to
[1:23:43] drop down over a bit of
[1:23:46] a building and try to make him committed
[1:23:48] since

[1:23:51] suicide but what did what he did
[1:23:54] don't you do that devil don't even try
[1:23:56] that don't you even try to tip me but
[1:23:58] the major attempt was when he said i

[1:24:05] right now all you got to do is just fly
[1:24:07] down fly down and make me god that what

[1:25:29] going to be he's going to be the one
[1:25:31] they're going to win
[1:25:32] by god grace and we realize that you see
[1:25:35] it the power of god hate was operating
[1:25:36] his word he walked on this earth and
[1:25:39] done these things right here by the
[1:25:40] power of the holy spirit in that word so
[1:25:42] he that what he been doing he been
[1:25:43] showing us these things right here and
[1:25:45] by god gracious
[1:25:47] then we realized so he's getting close
[1:25:49] and close he's getting old time is
[1:25:51] coming
[1:25:52] it's time to come he's going to take
[1:25:53] everything
[1:25:54] he had a power of god he said i'm going
[1:25:56] to get every gonna i'm going to take all
[1:25:58] my power and everything i got and i'm
[1:26:00] going to show the bride what i could do
[1:26:03] with this word holy by god grace you say
[1:26:05] brother you said but now i realize him
[1:26:07] but look at him when john come on the
[1:26:09] scene how did john was a great man here
[1:26:12] but john didn't have the power
[1:26:14] that god had
[1:26:15] he had the same faith but he didn't have
[1:26:17] the power that he had but by god grace
[1:26:19] he said but at the end
[1:26:22] john said i must decrease
[1:26:24] and he increased
[1:26:26] highly by the power of god how he look
[1:26:28] at our prophet when he come on the word
[1:26:30] of god he got that same revelation he
[1:26:32] thought i must decrease so god can
[1:26:34] increase him the power of god is on the
[1:26:36] increase right now here i let probably
[1:26:38] recognize he gonna come a time lord you
[1:26:40] i'm gonna i'm gonna move out of the way
[1:26:42] and the holy ghost gonna take over the
[1:26:44] place he knew that the prophet of god
[1:26:46] understood that word
[1:26:48] he know how to operate the power of the
[1:26:50] holy ghost and holy god move for it
[1:26:52] because god he realized when that time
[1:26:54] come he said i gotta i gotta decrease
[1:26:56] yeah so god could increase he's gonna be
[1:26:59] one of those on earth at one time he's
[1:27:01] gonna be now he's gonna be him god gonna
[1:27:02] be the supreme deity over this world
[1:27:04] he's gonna be the supreme power of this
[1:27:06] word
[1:27:07] yes hell about god grace
[1:27:10] hallelujah i'm taking that by the power
[1:27:11] of god hallelujah praise the lord ain't
[1:27:13] got none of my clothes in here but uh
[1:27:15] hallelujah i wouldn't realize here in
[1:27:17] that word so we realized god trying to
[1:27:19] get us under his control by the word of
[1:27:21] god hallelujah it come to time we got to
[1:27:23] get him to the tree now we got to get
[1:27:25] him closer to it holly but jesus before
[1:27:27] he got down i'm just bringing this
[1:27:29] bringing it when he before he got down
[1:27:30] to to the place to die he'd done a lot
[1:27:33] of supernatural things yeah he done a
[1:27:35] lot of supernatural thing people the
[1:27:38] same ministry that you've seen in that
[1:27:39] prophet do he was doing the same thing
[1:27:41] how he gave him the same authority use
[1:27:44] that gift like you sure show them show
[1:27:46] them props show that prophet how to use
[1:27:48] them gifts that prophet stood there and
[1:27:50] he done it one by one showing you that
[1:27:52] jesus christ is the man and that word
[1:27:54] that was given his mind that the prophet
[1:27:56] had highly it was not brother bran and
[1:27:58] my it was god man there was god inside a
[1:28:02] man it was the man he did not he said i
[1:28:04] let the man of god his mind let the mind
[1:28:07] that was in christ be in you he said he
[1:28:09] would he would he'd be giving him his
[1:28:11] man he would let him have his mind god

[2:23:59] he sang that song at a fellowship
[2:24:01] meeting
[2:24:02] he grabbed a tambourine
[2:24:05] and he sung it like he believed it
[2:24:08] and i stuck in my heart because you know
[2:24:10] what if you can't see the city
[2:24:12] at least see the lights
[2:24:14] oh yeah you've got to see the lights

[2:24:21] that city's being built for me and you
[2:24:24] and when you see a man stand back and
[2:24:26] take a tambourine and sing it from his
[2:24:29] heart
[2:24:30] that stuck with me for years and i love
[2:24:32] that song
[2:24:33] because it makes this real to me yeah i
[2:24:35] can almost
[2:24:37] like brother joel said
[2:24:39] so what if we go by the graves or what
[2:24:41] if we're standing when the rapture comes
[2:24:44] that's all right
[2:24:46] amen
[2:24:48] brother homer are you
[2:24:49] that song stays with me
[2:24:52] because you're saying it from the heart
[2:24:54] so let's sing it one more time and sing
