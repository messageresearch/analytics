[2:59] but he's been there so long the dialysis
[3:02] is but it's all working and his heart's
[3:04] held up good and we're just praying that
[3:06] the lord will wean him off all that
[3:08] other but he is coveted free there is no
[3:10] covet he has got through all that
[3:12] and he doesn't have covet anymore but it
[3:14] has
[3:15] it has wracked his body so much until um
[3:18] but hey if god take him through that
[3:20] he'll take him through all the others
[3:22] amen
[3:23] also i want to thank you for your
[3:25] prayers
[3:26] for friday and saturday i was in the
[3:28] hospital there for a couple of days
[3:32] was something that happened
[3:35] i know you all prayed for me i know you
[3:37] all did everybody did
[3:40] but
[3:44] i was getting ready to do a
[3:46] stress test
[3:51] and i get two
[3:53] little pictures
[3:55] text to me
[3:58] one of them was the bonnet girls
[4:01] standing up for me
[4:04] and one was little zoe yorego
[4:08] played me a song on the piano
[4:10] now i know i i
[4:13] no not belittling anybody's prayer
[4:16] but those two touched me more than
[4:17] anything
[4:20] because that's god's kids
[4:22] and for them to be able to do that
[4:26] and i want you to pray because i want to
[4:28] read you this quote
[4:31] because i don't know if you knew if you
[4:32] all know this or not but i've been
[4:34] struggling for a while for different
[4:36] from different things but
[4:38] it's like it's been moving around and
[4:42] it's kind of like they're shooting at it
[4:43] with a shotgun and uh
[4:46] so when they put me in the hospital
[4:48] friday i said look
[4:49] don't want to go home until we find out
[4:51] everything
[4:54] from nose to toes
[4:57] and i'll tell y'all one more time
[4:59] i do have a brain
[5:03] it's it's documented and i do have a
[5:06] heart
[5:07] it's documented
[5:09] okay so i just want to get that out of
[5:11] the way so don't call me heartless and
[5:12] brainless anymore
[5:15] but they put me through every test
[5:17] saturday stress test
[5:20] nuclear
[5:21] um when i tell you what ekg what was it
[5:24] echocard what was the one where they do
[5:25] the
[5:27] the echo
[5:28] echocardiogram they did echo at four
[5:30] o'clock four o'clock saturday morning
[5:33] they did every test and they all came
[5:36] back fine
[5:37] hey man but
[5:41] but when i walked out of the hospital i
[5:43] had the same symptoms when i walked in
[5:46] i was just about ten thousand dollars
[5:48] later in money
[5:50] that puts a lot of stress now the
[5:52] insurance will pay for most of that but
[5:54] but still going through all that two
[5:55] days
[5:57] and then you walk out with the same
[5:59] symptoms
[6:01] it just makes you
[6:03] think about things you know
[6:06] and and like i said
[6:08] there's nothing wrong with me as far as
[6:10] i know
[6:11] internally
[6:12] they did ct scan from here down they did
[6:15] one up here the other day i did the
[6:17] stress test i stayed on the treadmill
[6:19] for eight and a half minutes on an
[6:20] incline and i did fine didn't fall out
[6:24] and they checked my heart and it was
[6:25] fine oh i want to tell you something
[6:26] before we get started
[6:28] i did talk to the cardiologist
[6:30] and here's my um wait a minute i'm on my
[6:32] soapbox now he said the worst problem
[6:35] that he is having
[6:36] is with young people coming into that
[6:40] place
[6:41] and having their heart checked
[6:43] and the walls of their heart are
[6:45] thinning out and their heart is
[6:46] enlarging because of
[6:49] i'm going to hurt your feelings
[6:51] monster
[6:53] red bull
[6:56] all those energy drinks
[6:58] he said they're killing our young people
[7:01] now i'm just telling you what he said
[7:03] he said it's enlarging their heart
[7:04] beforehand
[7:06] and he said if you have any children he
[7:08] said and deanna drinks them every once
[7:09] in a while too so i'm gonna get on with
[7:10] her
[7:12] but you need to stop drinking those
[7:14] energy drinks
[7:16] i mean why would you drink something
[7:17] with a monster with a claw on the side
[7:18] of it i thought we was trying to get
[7:20] away from the market i made the beast
[7:23] i'm drinking a monster
[7:25] to help me
[7:27] i'm just telling you what the doctor
[7:28] said he said their heart's enlarging
[7:29] because it's eating
[7:31] the um the muscles on the inside of the
[7:34] heart
[7:35] because of all that caffeine and all
[7:36] that stuff and he said whatever was in
[7:38] that he said 30 years ago
[7:41] fda took it off the market because it
[7:44] was some kind of something that was
[7:45] killing people because they were doing
[7:46] it for diet you know it's revving them
[7:48] up
[7:49] whatever that chemical is
[7:51] he said they just a few years later they
[7:52] just run it right back in under a
[7:54] different name and put it in the red
[7:55] bull and all that other stuff so be
[7:57] careful
[8:02] be careful i mean listen we we do need
[8:05] my point is we need to
[8:06] god's going to take care of us but let's
[8:08] just try to take care of some things our
[8:10] own self that's you know like we all
[8:13] need to eat a little better and
[8:16] going to die maybe a little bit so i'm
[8:18] going to read you this quote though
[8:19] because this is
[8:20] this is something i i was thinking about
[8:22] yesterday
[8:23] because when that lady came in i know
[8:25] i'm holding you up for a minute but you
[8:26] know what you stand up you don't fall
[8:27] asleep
[8:29] amen
[8:31] so the lady walked in and she said
[8:33] well
[8:34] she said
[8:36] i guess i got good news i said what do
[8:37] you mean you guess you got good news she
[8:39] said well there's nothing wrong with
[8:41] your heart
[8:43] she said but if you're still having no
[8:45] symptoms we don't know what it is
[8:49] because i mean they checked me all the
[8:50] way i mean you can see my blood work
[8:52] blood works fine
[8:55] i did get a cough but i did get a covet
[8:57] test
[8:58] and it was negative so thank god for
[9:00] that one listen to this quote
[9:03] the kind heavenly father
[9:05] as this woman
[9:07] is seeking to have life
[9:11] and to be rid of this misery
[9:14] standing before this audience tonight i
[9:16] pray for our lord
[9:18] with all my heart
[9:20] and your service the doctors
[9:23] has tried to relieve her of this
[9:25] but has failed to do it
[9:31] but thou will not fail
[9:36] we still believe that god's alive right
[9:38] amen
[9:40] thou will not fail your god
[9:42] and you can't fail
[9:44] and now satan to you that's bound this
[9:46] woman you've hid it from the doctors
[9:49] but you can't hide it from god
[9:53] come out of this woman in the name of
[9:55] jesus christ
[9:56] that's the discernment we need to look
[9:58] for
[9:59] sure we lean on doctors but satan can
[10:01] try to hide all he wants to but i was
[10:03] talking to richard douglas yesterday and
[10:04] he said man he said you wouldn't believe
[10:07] at all the
[10:10] sicknesses and and covet and all that
[10:12] the uh
[10:13] that the
[10:14] fivefold ministry is going around the
[10:15] world
[10:16] being afflicted by it
[10:18] so
[10:20] we must be doing something right
[10:24] but i need to find out what this is
[10:26] going on in my body because i feel just
[10:28] the same as i did
[10:30] ten thousand dollars ago
[10:33] but now the doctors did what they said
[10:35] they was gonna do
[10:37] they said you're you're fine
[10:40] there's nothing there
[10:43] no
[10:44] abnormalities no you know nothing's
[10:46] enlarged and
[10:49] but you just pray
[10:52] not just for my health you just pray
[10:53] that god will show that thing
[10:56] and i can get rid of it
[10:58] because i'm tired of it i'm tired and
[11:00] i'm tired of it amen so brother bob is
[11:03] going to preach this afternoon
[11:06] and just uh pray for us
[11:08] and like i said let's pray that that
[11:11] prayer
[11:13] you can talk to satan he talks to you
[11:14] all the time don't he
[11:16] hello
[11:17] he talks to you probably more than god
[11:19] does
[11:20] right
[11:21] so let's let's talk to satan and say
[11:23] look buddy
[11:25] time for you to leave
[11:28] i want him to be uncomfortable
[11:30] listen i want him to be uncomfortable in
[11:32] this thing
[11:33] this is where i want him to be
[11:34] uncomfortable
[11:35] i want him to be uncomfortable in this
[11:37] thing first and then everything else
[11:38] will take care of itself but you just
[11:39] keep us in prayer
[11:41] we'll all do the best we can i'm not
[11:42] gonna nobody's gonna stop lord of mercy
[11:44] why in the world when we stop
[11:47] we got too much to do
[11:49] all right let's go to the eternal plan
[11:50] of redemption
[11:53] part 32
[11:55] let's bow our hands dear heavenly father

[11:58] we appreciate the time that we have lord
[12:00] to speak to your bride
[12:03] now we pray lord that you sanctify us
[12:04] for this journey lord you said you would
[12:06] equip us with everything we needed
[12:09] and lord i pray that we'll pick up the
[12:10] sword and pick up the shield and take
[12:12] the armor
[12:13] and lord will take
[12:15] as the prophet said one time we'll take
[12:17] it to the heart of the enemy
[12:19] and take care of him lord
[12:22] and lord we pray that you'd be with each
[12:23] one around the world lord that
[12:25] it does seem like the little bride's
[12:26] being beat up
[12:28] by satan and all these different
[12:29] diseases and
[12:31] anxieties and cares of life
[12:34] but you promised we'd make it
[12:36] you promised you would equip a bride to
[12:39] make it in the end time so lord we must
[12:41] come under that
[12:42] come under that holy come into that holy
[12:44] of holies to where nothing else can be
[12:47] there except for me and you are the
[12:50] bride
[12:51] and you lord that's what we're looking
[12:52] at father because we're talking about a
[12:53] millennium now in just a minute where
[12:56] we're going to sit with you and rule and
[12:57] reign a thousand years and we're going
[12:58] to be able to talk to you lord we're
[13:00] going to be able to do as the old
[13:02] as the old man said told brother adam
[13:04] said
[13:05] i don't care about anything else just
[13:07] let me look at him for a thousand years
[13:09] just let me look at him
[13:12] for that whole thousand years
[13:13] so lord i want to see you now and your
[13:15] people
[13:16] i want to see you now and your word made
[13:18] manifest through the people and father
[13:20] we pray that you'll be with each one
[13:21] take care of us and sanctify us for this
[13:22] journey lord in jesus name we pray
[13:24] amen
[13:27] sorry i usually don't boohoo
[13:32] hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming
[13:34] high priests with good things to come by
[13:36] a greater more perfect tabernacle that
[13:38] is to say not made with hands that is to
[13:40] say not of this building
[13:42] neither by the brother of goats and
[13:43] calves but by his own blood he entered
[13:45] once in the holy place having obtained
[13:47] eternal redemption
[13:49] for us revelations 11 3 and i will give
[13:52] power to my two witnesses and they will
[13:53] prophesy a thousand two hundred three
[13:55] score days closing sackcloth
[13:57] and isaiah 65 17.
[13:59] i'll try to get to that today for behold
[14:02] i create new heavens now we know it's
[14:03] not going to be an annihilation and a
[14:06] creation he's going to do just like he
[14:08] did you
[14:09] he didn't annihilate you he just burnt
[14:11] you off by the holy ghost and fire
[14:14] burnt the old you out
[14:16] and put the holy ghost inside well
[14:18] that's what he's going to do he's going
[14:19] to i was reading a quote a minute ago
[14:20] brother brown said we won't need the
[14:21] holy ghost in the millennium
[14:24] we need it now we don't need it over
[14:26] there because we will be the holy ghost
[14:28] we will be anointing to the temple we
[14:29] won't need the holy ghost to lead us and
[14:31] guide us we'll be in perfection there
[14:33] with the lord jesus
[14:35] but behold i create new heavens
[14:38] and a new earth and the former shall not
[14:40] be remembered nor come into mind you may
[14:42] be seated in the lord at his blessing
[14:44] to reading the word and so we'll just
[14:45] fly through this real quick
[14:48] god bless you for being here today
[14:51] you know we
[14:53] we've struggled for a long time all of
[14:55] us we've all
[14:56] been through battles but it'll be over
[14:58] pretty soon amen it'll be over
[15:01] matthew 16 verse 15 now we were talking
[15:03] about
[15:05] and i hope you can that you see this
[15:08] simon says thou art to christ the son of
[15:09] the living god and jesus said unto him
[15:11] blessed art thou simon bar jonah for
[15:12] flesh and blood have not revealed it
[15:14] unto thee but my father which is in
[15:16] heaven and i say unto thee that thou art
[15:18] peter and upon this rock i will build my
[15:21] church
[15:22] a revelation of the son of god that he's
[15:25] going to come back on the day of
[15:26] pentecost he's going to indwell a group
[15:28] of people and they're going to be little
[15:30] jesuses for 2000 years everybody got
[15:33] that say amen all right and the gates of
[15:35] hell which we know the gates of hell's
[15:37] right here shall not prevail against it
[15:40] so we need to we need to truly
[15:42] understand and we'll get into it
[15:45] a little bit further as we
[15:47] finish this
[15:48] we'll get into the son of man and see
[15:50] uh see what the son of man is we'll
[15:52] start back uh aaron and different ones
[15:55] have been talking about it but we're
[15:56] gonna start back in the old testament
[15:58] and bring that son of man all the way
[16:00] into the new testament
[16:01] and we're right here because this is
[16:03] where this is the age of the son of man
[16:05] as brother claude was talking about the
[16:06] age of aquarius which is the water boy
[16:08] which is the only man in the zodiac
[16:11] right
[16:12] with the water pot amen
[16:15] so son of man is what we're gonna we're
[16:18] not gonna deal with today
[16:21] but that's what's got to come
[16:23] before we take a rapture
[16:25] the revelation of the son of man has got
[16:27] to come before we take a rapture and
[16:29] we'll we already talked about that a
[16:30] little bit but let's go to revelations 4
[16:32] 1 because after that comes up
[16:35] we're going to be caught up come up
[16:36] hither and i'll show you things which
[16:38] being here after and immediately i was
[16:39] in the spirit and behold the throne was
[16:40] set in heaven and one sat on the throne
[16:42] now that's our rapture
[16:45] now remember the time periods the time
[16:47] periods are going to be
[16:49] the first two thousand years was from
[16:51] adam to the flood everybody got there
[16:55] the first two thousand years was adam to
[16:57] the flood then from the flood to christ
[16:59] from christ to
[17:02] um 2000 or now the 2000 church ages and
[17:06] then there's going to be a millennial
[17:08] reign that's going to happen later on
[17:10] after that so you've got all these
[17:11] dispensations
[17:13] you and i are in what we're in the bride
[17:16] are the gentile dispensation
[17:19] and we're waiting now for the son of man
[17:22] and then not waiting but you know for
[17:24] the full manifestation that everything
[17:26] will come to pass and that we will take
[17:29] a body change we which are alive and
[17:31] remain me and brother rush were talking
[17:32] about this yesterday
[17:34] he's still really hung on that because
[17:35] see that's a promise that if you now if
[17:37] you and i don't see that promise we're
[17:39] not gonna make it
[17:40] we which are alive and remain
[17:44] that's us we shall not sleep behold i
[17:47] show you a mystery we shall not all
[17:49] sleep
[17:50] that's what you've got somebody's got to
[17:51] stand up and say that's me
[17:53] amen
[17:55] so now as we do that and we go and take
[17:58] a rapture then we know what's going to
[17:59] happen the tribulation according to
[18:01] matthew 24 21 for then shall be great
[18:04] tribulations such as was not since the
[18:05] beginning of the world to this time no
[18:08] ever shall be listen the tribute we
[18:10] think this is this is just nothing
[18:12] compared to what's going to happen
[18:15] nothing compared to what's going to
[18:16] happen
[18:17] okay what's going to happen is is we're
[18:19] going to absolutely
[18:21] get out of here and then it's going to
[18:23] be the wrath of god
[18:25] poured out on a sinless nation
[18:28] amen
[18:29] and a sinless world and then we know in
[18:31] just a few minutes what happens to that
[18:34] god goes to israel
[18:36] and begins excuse me speaking to them
[18:39] to do what bring their dispensation into
[18:42] being the three and a half years that
[18:44] they get of the calling out of the 144
[18:46] 000
[18:48] matthew 24 says for there should be
[18:49] great tribulation such as not since the
[18:52] time of the world of this time nor ever
[18:53] shall be
[18:55] now revelations 2 verse 20
[18:58] there is a time in that 2000 years
[19:01] because this is the church ages there's
[19:02] a time in that 2000 years that god's
[19:04] going to give
[19:06] the church because the woman jezebel
[19:08] that's a church he's going to give the
[19:10] church time to repent behold i will cast
[19:13] her into bed and them that commit
[19:14] adultery with her into great tribulation
[19:17] except they repented their deeds and
[19:19] they did not
[19:22] they did not they took those deeds and
[19:23] made them doctrines as you'll see in the
[19:25] church ages if you'll study your church
[19:27] ages like we always have
[19:29] that it goes saying deed doctrine
[19:32] they met a doctrine on all those deeds
[19:34] and then and what was it trinity
[19:36] three unclean spirits like frogs all the
[19:38] different things like that
[19:40] that's what we're living or they are
[19:42] living under
[19:44] not us
[19:46] now revelation 13 4
[19:50] and they worship the dragon which gave
[19:51] power to the beast
[19:53] now see we're not going to be here
[19:57] we're going to be gone we're going to
[19:59] see this but this is going to happen
[20:02] because it says they worship the dragon
[20:03] which gave power to the beast now we're
[20:05] talking about the united states and
[20:07] and the different ones giving power to
[20:09] rome or to the to the beast and they
[20:11] worship the beast say who is likened to
[20:13] the beast who is able to make war with
[20:14] him like i told you before
[20:17] he's going to do some
[20:18] miracles he's going to be allowed to do
[20:21] some miracles that's going to turn the
[20:22] whole world toward this one man
[20:26] but it's going to be the most godless
[20:28] person that ever
[20:29] ever stepped foot on the earth it's
[20:31] going to be the antichrist
[20:34] the epitome of the antichrist that was
[20:36] given unto him a mouth speaking great
[20:37] things and blasphemies and power was
[20:40] given unto him to continue
[20:42] three and a half years or 42 months and
[20:44] he opened his mouth and blasphemed
[20:46] against god to blaspheme his name and
[20:48] his tabernacle them that dwell in heaven
[20:50] and it was given unto him to make war
[20:51] with the saints and overcome them
[20:53] power's given him all kin look at the
[20:55] power that was given this guy kindred
[20:57] tongues and nations look and all that
[20:59] dwell on the
[21:00] earth and all that dwell on the earth
[21:03] shall worship
[21:04] him whose names are not written in the
[21:06] book of life with lamb slain from the
[21:08] foundation of the world if you have the
[21:09] baptism of the holy ghost today
[21:11] you can't be deceived now you can
[21:15] you can be confused
[21:17] but you can't be deceived
[21:18] if you've got the true baptism of the
[21:20] holy ghost today you can't be deceived
[21:22] you can like i said before you can be
[21:24] confused or you can have questions or
[21:26] you can have these things in your mind
[21:28] or in your heart but you can't be
[21:29] deceived because what's deceiving the
[21:32] world out there now that doctrine of the
[21:34] water baptism
[21:36] all the different doctrines like brother
[21:37] bob was talking about the cutting of the
[21:38] hair i mean you go out there and they're
[21:40] just
[21:41] they're just taking what they want in
[21:42] the world
[21:45] they're pulling out what bible parts
[21:46] they want and putting in parts that they
[21:49] that don't need to be there and and
[21:51] they're just what so they're
[21:54] worshiping
[21:56] satan
[21:57] thinking they're worshiping god
[22:00] what a deception in this end time
[22:04] that really makes you shivers run down
[22:05] your spine
[22:07] because you know what you were caught up
[22:09] in that system
[22:10] before you got born again
[22:12] you and i were caught up in that very
[22:14] system before you were born again
[22:16] and if you're not born again you're
[22:17] still caught up in that system it
[22:18] doesn't matter where you sit
[22:21] make a difference where you're sitting
[22:22] at today if you're not born again you're
[22:24] in that system
[22:26] because all
[22:28] all that dwell on the earth
[22:31] shall worship him whose names are not
[22:32] written in the book of life of the lamb
[22:33] slain from the foundation
[22:35] of the world let's go to revelations 11
[22:37] 3.
[22:38] now this after the gentile
[22:40] dispensation's over
[22:42] he's going to give power to two
[22:43] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[22:44] thousand two hundred three score days
[22:46] now who is that two witnesses
[22:48] they're gonna prophesy what they're
[22:49] gonna three and a half year message to
[22:51] israel
[22:52] that's all they're to get
[22:54] that's all they promised to get and
[22:56] they're to pull out 144 000
[23:00] and they've got all kinds of power too
[23:03] if any man will hurt them fire
[23:04] proceedeth out of the mouth now listen
[23:05] fire's not going to come out of their
[23:06] mouth it's going to be the word that
[23:08] they speak amen so it's the word that
[23:10] comes out of their mouth that they're
[23:11] speaking just like me and you
[23:16] you've got to believe that
[23:18] that your word has power
[23:20] if you're speaking the word of god and
[23:22] you've got the baptism the holy ghost
[23:23] there's mechanics and dynamics
[23:26] everybody says we're waiting on you know
[23:27] we got mechanics we're waiting on
[23:29] dynamics if you got the new birth you
[23:31] got the dynamic
[23:33] the mechanics is
[23:34] this the dynamics is what you read of it
[23:38] and believe it and have faith in it and
[23:41] know that it's right
[23:43] regardless of whatever happens
[23:44] regardless if your best friend or your
[23:46] neighbor quits a message or your or this
[23:48] and there your pastor quits the message
[23:50] and whatever you want to call it
[23:52] you stay
[23:54] with the message
[23:56] you stay with the message of the hour
[23:58] because that's what's going to carry us
[24:00] through and then that same
[24:02] anointing is going to go
[24:04] after this dispensation's over where is
[24:06] it going it's going right over to the
[24:07] jews for three and a half years
[24:09] and they're going to preach the power
[24:12] that you and i get at the end they're
[24:14] going it's just going to carry right
[24:15] over into
[24:17] the jews and they're going to have see
[24:18] look you say well this is only to them
[24:21] well listen for us to get out of here
[24:24] we got to have some miracles happen too
[24:27] we need some miracles right now i was
[24:29] reading quotes brother brown i'm talking
[24:30] about two people asking about the
[24:32] millennium said
[24:33] and dad's quoted it many times brother
[24:35] brown says they said we need sons of god
[24:38] in the millennium he said we don't need
[24:39] sons of god in the millennium he said we
[24:41] need him now
[24:43] he said we don't need healing in the
[24:44] millennium he said we need healing now
[24:47] so we need this now
[24:50] that we can that fire can proceed out of
[24:52] our mouth and what we say
[24:54] is going to come to pass you just keep
[24:56] speaking it and let god take care of the
[24:58] rest okay because listen you can't make
[25:00] it happen
[25:02] but you can be available
[25:04] when it happens
[25:05] when god wants it to happen you put
[25:07] yourself available and god will use your
[25:09] vessel and make whatever xyz that you
[25:12] want to put in there that'll make it
[25:13] happen
[25:14] just to get through life a lot of times
[25:15] that way
[25:17] so daniel 9 24 let's go to the real
[25:19] quick i want to try to get the
[25:20] millennium
[25:23] 70 weeks remember it takes 490 years now
[25:26] remember
[25:28] i was thinking about this today
[25:31] take 490 years so because it's 70 weeks
[25:34] times 7 7 7 is 49. so 490 years
[25:38] for them to come to redemption
[25:42] now to me and you that's no dates or
[25:44] times we come to redemption as gentiles
[25:48] as individuals
[25:50] they're coming as a nation they're
[25:51] coming as a nation as a people and as a
[25:54] city all right that's how god deals with
[25:57] the jews that's always how he wanted to
[25:58] deal with the jews everybody got that
[26:01] so 70 weeks what 70 times seven
[26:04] 490 years
[26:06] because
[26:08] that
[26:09] remember
[26:10] seven sevens keeps you in church ages
[26:14] if i understand that
[26:18] the millennium
[26:19] will be the golden jubilee
[26:22] it will be after the 490 years is over
[26:24] with
[26:26] it'll be one extra day it'll put us in
[26:28] the millennium which will be
[26:29] the jubilee year now see we get a
[26:32] jubilee year but spiritually our release
[26:34] to go free is when our bodies change and
[26:36] we go up in a rapture but over there in
[26:38] israel though their
[26:40] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[26:42] in thy holy city to do those six things
[26:44] what to restore israel back
[26:47] to bring them back to redemption
[26:50] and bring a city into view all right
[26:54] everybody got that so 70 weeks
[26:56] 7 7 is 490 years 483 has already been
[27:01] taken care of
[27:02] to calvary then there's one week left
[27:04] after the rapture and when that week is
[27:06] over that's the end of the 490 that's
[27:09] still the seven sevens then you go into
[27:11] the golden jubilee which is a millennium
[27:14] and that's what they're going to that's
[27:15] why it's not to us
[27:17] it's to the jews it's not to us okay
[27:21] let's read jeremiah
[27:23] because they're going to have listen
[27:24] they're going to have to pay for their
[27:26] sins even you and me
[27:28] as christians we are going to have to
[27:30] pay for our sins
[27:33] the ones we don't confess
[27:36] everybody got that
[27:37] that's why you want to pray without
[27:39] ceasing and ask god to forgive you every
[27:41] day
[27:42] of the little things that you do
[27:44] because look but that great day that
[27:46] none is like it it's even the time of
[27:47] jacob's trouble
[27:49] but he shall be saved out of it
[27:52] for it shall come to pass in that day
[27:53] saith the lord of hosts and i will break
[27:55] his yoke from off of the neck and will
[27:57] burst our bonds listen they've been
[27:59] bound for two thousand years when he
[28:01] when they rejected christ at the cross
[28:04] and said let his blood be on us and our
[28:06] children then all the generations during
[28:09] the gentile age that we just talked
[28:11] about
[28:12] the jews are being persecuted
[28:15] we talk about the six and a half million
[28:17] because that's the ones we read about
[28:20] but go back way back
[28:22] to 80 70
[28:24] when they were dispersed
[28:26] a lot of them went to russia and they
[28:28] persecuted them in russia put them in a
[28:30] thing called the ghetto
[28:31] everybody know where that ghetto is you
[28:33] know that's the word we we get old well
[28:35] the ghetto didn't come from
[28:37] where you think it came from
[28:39] it came from
[28:42] russia taking the jews
[28:45] and sticking them into a piece of the
[28:46] city and kind of building a wall around
[28:49] them and said that's where you go that's
[28:50] your ghetto
[28:52] that's where you go and they were living
[28:54] in poverty and all these different
[28:56] things so they were they've been
[28:57] persecuted everywhere they went but like
[28:59] i said before
[29:00] even scofield realizes that even though
[29:03] a jew is
[29:04] an outcast to us everywhere they go that
[29:07] nation prospers
[29:09] because god's going to take those
[29:10] nations though
[29:13] here in just a minute we'll read it
[29:14] god's going to take those nations that
[29:16] he dispersed them into he's going to
[29:18] destroy every one of them
[29:19] he's going to destroy every one of those
[29:21] nations
[29:22] foreign shall come to pass in that day
[29:23] saith the lord that i will break his
[29:24] yoke from off thy neck and i will burst
[29:27] my bonds and strangers shall no more
[29:29] serve themselves of him see strangers
[29:33] listen we're dogs remember to to the
[29:35] jews
[29:37] but they've been serving us for 2
[29:38] thousand years
[29:40] because they're not back now look
[29:42] now they're back in the homeland
[29:44] now they're a nation
[29:46] now they've got their own this and that
[29:47] and the other now they've got their own
[29:49] and they're back inside the
[29:51] jerusalem the
[29:52] homeland so what's god doing he's
[29:55] bringing them back wherever he dispersed
[29:56] them from he's bringing them back look
[29:58] but they shall serve the lord their god
[30:01] and david their king whom i will raise
[30:03] up unto them now remember it's not
[30:05] it's not david the person
[30:08] it's the son of david which is jesus
[30:10] christ that he promised
[30:13] would sit on the throne during the
[30:14] millennium all right and david their
[30:16] king who i will raise up
[30:18] up unto them therefore fear thou not owe
[30:21] my servant jacob
[30:22] and who is jacob
[30:24] israel
[30:26] neither be this made o israel for lo i
[30:28] will save thee from afar
[30:30] and thy seed from the land of their
[30:32] captivity
[30:34] russia united states germany wherever
[30:36] they've been dispersed to
[30:38] and then god's going to do what
[30:40] destroy those nations the battle of
[30:41] armageddon is going to be all the
[30:42] nations that are destroyed
[30:44] thy seed from the land of their
[30:45] captivity and jacob shall return
[30:47] and shall be in rest he's talking about
[30:50] the millennium
[30:52] and be quiet because look they're not
[30:54] resting over there now even though
[30:55] they're in their homeland
[30:58] i mean they're dropping read about it
[31:00] you don't really read about it over here
[31:01] but they drop 20 30 bombs a day over
[31:03] there they just keep throwing them at
[31:04] each other all the time
[31:06] so there's the sirens going off and
[31:08] planes going over and there's no rest
[31:10] but they will have a rest in the
[31:11] millennium i promise you that
[31:13] amen
[31:14] because listen we entered into our
[31:16] arrest by the baptism of the holy ghost
[31:18] and then we get a new body because of
[31:19] the baptism of the holy ghost that's our
[31:21] rest and then we go to
[31:24] a wedding supper and then we were
[31:25] resting then when we come back to the
[31:27] millennium we're resting still
[31:29] because why would you want your wife new
[31:31] wife what brother brown said one time
[31:33] why would you want your new wife to go
[31:34] out and work in the yard and
[31:36] build vineyards and build houses and
[31:39] i know we've done it before but
[31:42] god is not going to do that to you
[31:46] jacob shall return and shall be in rest
[31:47] and be quiet and none shall make him
[31:50] afraid for i am with he saith the lord
[31:52] to save thee according to daniel 70
[31:54] weeks
[31:56] though i make a full end of look of all
[31:59] nations whether i have scattered these
[32:00] so he's like i said before he's going to
[32:02] make
[32:03] all those ten kingdoms and all those
[32:05] things it lets the battle of
[32:06] armageddon's going to do away with every
[32:07] one of them
[32:10] because they persecuted the jews
[32:11] everywhere they've been they've been
[32:13] persecuted
[32:14] even the united states at one time
[32:15] they've been persecuted all right
[32:18] do i make a full end of all nations
[32:20] whether i have scattered thee yet will i
[32:21] not make a full end of thee he's making
[32:24] him a promise he's not going to destroy
[32:25] them he's going to bring him back in the
[32:27] homeland but now look
[32:28] but i will correct then measure
[32:31] they did something back there that god
[32:33] can't forget
[32:34] they put him on a cross
[32:36] but
[32:37] he made
[32:40] eternal redemption for them
[32:42] because they're part of this plan of
[32:44] eternal redemption so thank god for that
[32:48] and i will not leave thee altogether
[32:50] unpunished he's going to punish him
[32:53] but he's not going to punish him like
[32:54] he's going to punish this world
[32:56] revelation 6 verse 12
[32:59] and i beheld when he had opened the
[33:00] sixth seal although there was a great
[33:01] earthquake and the sun became black as
[33:03] sack cloth of hair the moon became his
[33:05] blood stars of heaven fell upon the
[33:07] earth even as a fig tree casted their
[33:08] own timely figs when she is shaking of a
[33:10] mighty wind and the heavens departed as
[33:12] a scroll when it was rolled together and
[33:14] every mountain and island were moved out
[33:16] of their places now listen we're not
[33:18] here so don't worry about it
[33:21] if you're watching in tonight you live
[33:22] on an island don't worry about it if
[33:24] you're born again you're not going to be
[33:25] there
[33:26] but that island is going to crash into
[33:28] the sea sometime after that we get out
[33:30] of here and before the battle of
[33:32] armageddon or somewhere around that time
[33:35] i was reading too where brother brown
[33:36] was talking about
[33:38] laodicea do you know laodicea what was
[33:41] allowed to see it destroyed by
[33:43] the writ the literal
[33:45] town
[33:46] city in asia minor was destroyed by a
[33:48] series of earthquakes
[33:51] it just fell right over into the sea he
[33:53] said so will happen at the end of this
[33:55] age
[33:56] a series of earthquakes will just break
[33:58] this place to pieces
[34:00] so this is going to happen worse though
[34:02] because we're not going to be here
[34:04] we might go through a few earthquakes
[34:06] and
[34:06] and lord we need to pray for those
[34:07] people in new orleans i don't know
[34:08] what's going on but that was one of the
[34:10] biggest hurricanes they said that ever
[34:11] hit the
[34:13] hit the um
[34:14] that area down there in new orleans so
[34:16] just pray for the people
[34:18] and the kings of the earth and the great
[34:19] men the rich men and chief captains
[34:21] mighty men every bottom and every free
[34:23] man hid themselves in dens and the rocks
[34:25] of the mountains and said to the
[34:26] mountains and rocks fall on us
[34:28] and hide us from the face of him that
[34:31] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[34:33] of the lamb for the great day of his
[34:34] wrath has come and who shall be able to
[34:36] stand well look nobody's going to be
[34:38] able to stand
[34:39] no one's going to be able to stand that
[34:41] all right everybody got that say amen
[34:43] all right now the seventh seal let's
[34:45] read this quote notice there's a whole
[34:47] earth to be purged
[34:49] there will be such a thing that the moon
[34:51] stars and all nature will be purged you
[34:53] see what it is
[34:54] the earth is renewing herself being
[34:56] purged getting ready for the millennium
[34:58] the millennium's coming up and see
[35:00] everything has got any felt on it is to
[35:02] be purged during that sixth seal now
[35:04] what time what time element is that
[35:06] under the two prophets
[35:08] they open the sixth seal so the two
[35:10] prophets open
[35:12] these happenings
[35:13] before the millennium takes place all
[35:15] right
[35:17] so now let's go to revelation 7 1.
[35:21] try to get through this and get to the
[35:22] millennium
[35:24] now after these things i saw four angels
[35:26] standing on the four corners of the
[35:27] earth
[35:28] holding the four winds water winds wars
[35:30] that the wind would not blow on the
[35:32] earth nor on the sea and on any tree and
[35:34] i saw another angel ascending from east
[35:36] having the seal of the living god and he
[35:38] cried with a loud voice of the four
[35:39] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[35:41] earth and see
[35:42] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[35:44] sea nor the trees till we have sealed
[35:46] the servants now brother brown said
[35:48] that's not bride
[35:50] we're not servants
[35:52] we're bride
[35:54] but the 144 thousand are servants
[35:57] because they lost their position when
[35:58] they put jesus on a cross
[36:00] until we have sealed the servants of our
[36:02] god in their forehead i heard the number
[36:04] of them which were sealed now see
[36:05] remember
[36:07] under the gentile dispensation it's many
[36:09] tongues nations
[36:10] you can't even count them
[36:12] but you can count these and i heard the
[36:14] number of them which were sealed and
[36:15] there were sealed 140 and 4 000 of all
[36:18] the tribes
[36:19] of the children of israel
[36:22] now what's going to happen is daniel 9
[36:23] 27
[36:26] when that ceiling is over
[36:29] the satan the antichrist whatever you
[36:31] want the beast
[36:33] he's going to confirm the covenant with
[36:35] many for one week this is right after we
[36:36] leave but in the midst of that wheat so
[36:38] after three and a half years
[36:39] of that preaching that's over with he's
[36:42] going to break the covenant he's going
[36:44] to step on the scene and he's going to
[36:45] say i'm god
[36:48] worship me i'm god
[36:50] well god's not going to be able to stand
[36:51] for that
[36:53] in revelations 11 verse 7
[36:55] even as we see that when they had
[36:57] finished their testimony the beast
[36:59] descended out of the bottomless pit to
[37:00] make war against them and shall overcome
[37:02] them and kill them
[37:04] and they're going to lay in the street
[37:05] but what's going to happen they're going
[37:06] to take a rapture they're going to be
[37:09] raised from the dead then the 144 000
[37:11] and they're going to take a rapture
[37:15] now let's go to number two in the 70th
[37:16] week of daniel
[37:20] all right
[37:22] now let me stop here just a minute
[37:24] as you might know beyond one shouted out
[37:26] i just wouldn't take that one place i
[37:27] can take it through the entire scripture
[37:29] prove to me that seven days set one week
[37:31] is seven years in the bible i just did
[37:33] it in revelations the 13th chapter or
[37:35] 11th chapter all right look them
[37:37] prophets will prophesy
[37:40] excuse me
[37:42] one thousand two hundred and three score
[37:43] days which is in the midst of the last
[37:45] week of the jews then they're cut off
[37:47] and armageddon sets in so
[37:50] the two witnesses leave the 144 000
[37:52] leave
[37:53] he breaks that covenant with the listen
[37:56] he didn't break the covenant with with
[37:57] 144 thousand
[38:00] just like me and you we never were in a
[38:02] church
[38:02] age if you're born again you were called
[38:05] out of the church age they got born
[38:07] again they got called out of that
[38:09] whatever that age is
[38:12] and they're going to be gone before the
[38:13] battle of armageddon sets in all right
[38:16] trying to get to order it down here
[38:19] now number three
[38:23] and when he gets the money
[38:25] all that under control then he'll break
[38:27] this covenant with the jews as daniel
[38:29] said he would do
[38:30] i missed the last half of the 70th week
[38:33] of daniel then brother what will he do
[38:35] he'll have all the world's trade the
[38:37] commerce pack with the world
[38:40] listen he's going to have everything
[38:41] under his control everything
[38:45] and during that time the two prophets
[38:47] will rise on the scene and call 144 000
[38:49] then what will take place then the mark
[38:51] of the beast of revelations will set in
[38:53] because he holds all the commerce
[38:54] trading everything in the world
[38:56] what will take place then the mark of
[38:57] the beast will come and that no man can
[38:59] buy or sell except him that has the mark
[39:01] of the beast so they're all going listen
[39:04] before you got born again
[39:07] listen before you got born again
[39:09] what was your whole life centered around
[39:13] making money
[39:14] and finding how to make more money and
[39:16] how to have more stuff
[39:19] amen
[39:20] well that's what these people do because
[39:21] they're not born again they want stuff
[39:23] so they go to the person that's got the
[39:25] stuff and they really don't care what
[39:26] they got to do they say okay we'll do
[39:28] whatever we need to do just
[39:30] we need to buy ourselves some of this
[39:31] gold or whatever it is
[39:33] but look thank god the church will be
[39:35] enjoying a great three and a half years
[39:36] in glory
[39:37] we don't have to go through that thank
[39:39] god
[39:40] we don't have to go through that
[39:42] all right let's go to revelations 19 6.
[39:47] the bible says for the marriage of the
[39:48] lamb has come and his wife has made
[39:50] herself ready
[39:51] now this is where in the rapture we're
[39:53] caught up
[39:55] said blessed is he that's called up to
[39:57] the mad supper of the lamb so we're
[39:58] going to a mad supper
[40:00] like i said before it does not matter
[40:02] how long we're going to be there because
[40:03] we're not going to be in time
[40:05] okay
[40:06] but we know that a time element has got
[40:09] to be on earth of three and a half years
[40:10] of the preaching of of the two witnesses
[40:12] so that's how we know that all right
[40:15] now let's go to
[40:16] revelation 16 13.
[40:21] this is where i see saw three unclean
[40:23] spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
[40:24] of the dragon now the mouth of the beast
[40:26] and out of the mouth of the false
[40:27] prophet for they are the spirits of
[40:28] devils working miracles which go forth
[40:31] unto the kings of the earth and of the
[40:33] whole world
[40:34] see we think the president's powerful
[40:38] he's just a puppet to this guy
[40:40] every other nation is just a puppet to
[40:42] this guy
[40:44] even now all that's working folks it's
[40:46] not just one day they're going to walk
[40:47] up and go oh this great beast no they're
[40:50] working on it right now it's all working
[40:53] on right now and listen i believe the
[40:55] 144 thousands over in israel
[40:57] and those two witnesses may be over
[40:59] there too
[41:01] because we're so close to getting out of
[41:03] here
[41:04] they got to be raised up they can't be
[41:06] little children they got to be over
[41:07] there so look
[41:09] everything's in place
[41:11] all the actors are here
[41:13] we're just getting ready to what
[41:15] do forward the play as far as what we're
[41:17] talking about
[41:18] brother brown says acts of a play
[41:21] and that's what we're doing we're
[41:22] playing out what the world what the
[41:23] bible told us that we're going to play
[41:25] out
[41:26] who was that to gather them to the
[41:28] battle of that great day of god almighty
[41:31] why are they going to do that they're
[41:32] going to gather together in a place
[41:34] called armageddon
[41:36] so when they do that
[41:39] they're going to be fighting for control
[41:40] of the whole world
[41:42] all right
[41:44] they think they're fighting for it now
[41:46] but they're going to really be fighting
[41:48] for it then so let's go to number four
[41:50] did we get through this
[41:53] yeah we'll not read it y'all know what
[41:55] that is
[41:57] the great battle of armament it'll
[41:58] finally wind up that'll be the last of
[42:00] it when she comes to the battle of
[42:01] armageddon that'll sell the whole thing
[42:03] just before the great millennium
[42:04] armageddon is to clean off the earth she
[42:06] repurifies herself with this atomic
[42:08] blowing so it's going to be an atomic
[42:10] battle
[42:11] it's not going to kill demons it's not
[42:13] going to kill spirits
[42:16] they're just going to be suppressed for
[42:17] a while we'll read that in a minute and
[42:19] the volcanic ash and things sink this
[42:21] soaked blood of men and upon the earth
[42:23] and sin and crime she sinks beneath the
[42:25] earth and the volcanic breathes out
[42:27] again and renews cleans the earth for
[42:29] the great
[42:30] millennium
[42:32] so now let's go to ezekiel 40.
[42:36] this is when the millennium temple is
[42:38] going to be built
[42:40] and the vision of god
[42:42] now who's ezekiel a prophet to israel
[42:45] not a prophet to the gentiles the
[42:47] prophet to israel all right
[42:49] so his prophecy is to israel
[42:51] and the vision of god brought him into
[42:53] the land of israel and set me upon a
[42:55] very high mountain by which was as the
[42:57] frame of a city on the south in other
[42:59] words what did he do he showed him the
[43:01] whole dimensions of this
[43:02] city because remember it's got to be to
[43:04] thy people and the holy city
[43:07] city's got to be built that city's got
[43:08] to be restored according to daniel 9 24.
[43:11] and it's got to be
[43:13] it's got to be done within that 490
[43:15] years that's why they can't just be
[43:17] three and a half years after the rapture
[43:18] to finish daniel 70 weeks there's got to
[43:20] be one week
[43:23] because the battle of armageddon starts
[43:24] in the middle of it it's not going to be
[43:25] a one-day battle
[43:27] and then they're going to come down and
[43:28] build i'm just telling you what the
[43:29] bible says
[43:31] they're going to come down and build
[43:32] this temple because you and i what
[43:34] we're not getting any calluses on our
[43:35] fingers
[43:36] no we're done
[43:38] why do they call it rest
[43:41] come to me all year labor and heavy lady
[43:42] and i'll give you rest brother brown
[43:44] said that was the baptism of the holy
[43:46] ghost oh yeah we fight for every inch of
[43:47] ground even with the holy ghost but
[43:49] listen if you got the baptism in the
[43:50] holy ghost think of all the rest that
[43:51] you're going to have later on
[43:54] oh my
[43:55] listen you can't fathom
[43:58] because number one we're time creatures
[43:59] number two we hurt an ache all over the
[44:01] place we're getting older
[44:02] but that's going to totally reverse one
[44:04] day
[44:05] and the former things will be passed
[44:07] away behold what all things will be made
[44:10] new yeah
[44:11] son of man behold with thine eyes and
[44:12] hear without ears and set that heart
[44:14] upon all that i should show thee
[44:19] so there's an intention for him doing
[44:20] this for to the intent that i might show
[44:24] them unto thee are thou brought hither
[44:26] declare all that thou seest to the house
[44:28] of israel not to me and you
[44:30] we don't build temples
[44:32] we don't build cities
[44:34] listen our future home is still not
[44:36] showed up yet
[44:38] and we don't build it at all brother
[44:40] brown said he builds it according to
[44:41] your desire
[44:43] amen so you don't have to build any of
[44:45] that because
[44:47] once reading
[44:48] this we must realize
[44:52] that when we read these scriptures
[44:53] brother brown says some of these
[44:54] scriptures you can overlay them for the
[44:56] millennium and the future home
[44:59] but some you cannot
[45:01] you have to separate them because it
[45:03] says they'll build houses and inhabit
[45:04] all this stuff that's not a future home
[45:07] john says i saw the holy city come down
[45:09] out of heaven
[45:10] as a bride a dorm for a husband
[45:12] so there's your difference so now let's
[45:14] read number five
[45:16] the sixth full purpose
[45:18] there will be an anointing when the most
[45:20] holy place will be anointed so they're
[45:22] gonna build the temple
[45:24] but now remember
[45:26] they're servants
[45:28] they're not bride
[45:30] so they're going to build the temple
[45:33] and be servants in the temple
[45:35] but who's going to be the anointing
[45:37] listen it only took a prophet to tell us
[45:38] this
[45:40] that the secret of this whole thing is
[45:42] is that you're the anointing to the
[45:43] temple
[45:44] that you and jesus christ are so much
[45:46] one
[45:48] to your husband and wife
[45:50] husband and wife is way more one than
[45:52] husband and servant
[45:53] or wife and servant
[45:56] your husband and wife are one
[45:58] that's that's what's been given to me
[46:00] and you so you and i listen by the
[46:02] baptism of the holy ghost we are the
[46:04] holy of holies
[46:06] there's not a building over there we got
[46:08] to go find the holy of holies you walk
[46:10] around with the holy of holies inside of
[46:11] you every day
[46:13] amen every day listen if you'll think
[46:15] about that
[46:17] if you'll think about that we'll quit
[46:19] acting the way we acting
[46:23] when you say that that thing was so
[46:26] revered and so precious
[46:28] that if if one thing was off
[46:32] the priest died
[46:33] one little thing
[46:35] god said do this do this do this do this
[46:37] do this
[46:38] if one thing was off it meant his life
[46:40] me and you walk in that every day amen
[46:43] every day
[46:45] come boldly to the throne the holy of
[46:46] holies has been opened up
[46:49] what and let the world see who it is
[46:52] thank god for the old testament to give
[46:54] the types and shadows
[46:56] and see that's what's blind to the jews
[46:58] though folks
[47:00] they think they got to get back to that
[47:01] temple
[47:02] literal temple
[47:04] literal sacrifices
[47:07] and when 144 000 walk up and say
[47:11] sorry
[47:12] i'm the temple of the holy ghost
[47:14] they're going to hate them
[47:16] they're not going to like them at all
[47:19] they're going to be persecuted by their
[47:21] own people
[47:22] amen there will be anointing when the
[47:23] most holy place will be anointed
[47:26] the holy holiest of holy is the most
[47:27] holy the most holy place is a sanctuary
[47:30] where god lived between the cherubims
[47:32] and this time christ will sit in the
[47:34] most holy place with the anointing upon
[47:37] him now who is the anointing me and you
[47:41] you and i are the anointing to that
[47:43] temple
[47:44] according to what the prophet said
[47:47] so we ride back according to revelations
[47:49] 19. let's read that real quick
[47:53] now remember we read revelations 19
[47:55] first of it said the bride or wife has
[47:57] made herself ready
[47:59] then there's all that singing and
[48:00] praising and then all of a sudden we
[48:02] show back up again
[48:04] in the end of revelations 11 through 16
[48:06] and i saw heaven open behold a white
[48:08] horse and he that set upon him was
[48:09] called faithful and true and in
[48:10] righteousness he does judge him at war
[48:13] as israel's flame of fire and on his
[48:14] head was many crowns
[48:16] and he had a name written that no man
[48:17] knew but he himself
[48:20] and he was clothed
[48:22] with a vesture dipped in blood and
[48:25] rolled it on up
[48:27] and his name is called the word of god
[48:30] in the beginning was the word where
[48:33] with god the word was god and the word
[48:34] was made flesh
[48:37] and the armies which were in heaven
[48:39] followed him upon white horses clothed
[48:42] and fined linen white and clean and out
[48:44] of his mouth go with a sharp sword what
[48:45] not a sword a word that with it he
[48:48] should smite the nations and he shall
[48:50] rule them with a rod of iron and he
[48:52] treadeth the wine press a wine press of
[48:54] the fierceness and wrath of almighty god
[48:56] he had on his vesture on his thy name
[48:59] written look capital letters king of
[49:00] kings and lord of lords the people that
[49:02] are behind him have become him
[49:06] there's no lesser
[49:08] elves or no lesser k's they've all
[49:10] become one when we write back in the
[49:12] millennium listen

[49:21] raised up the whole world that's the 144
[49:23] thousand

[49:26] in the millennium

[49:31] are mrs jesus christ

[51:35] end of the jewish age the end of the 490
[51:38] years
[51:39] right everybody got that it's the end of
[51:42] that of the 70 times 7.
[51:46] here he comes riding on a white horse
[51:49] those followed him on white horses
[51:50] horses powers
[51:53] dressed in white blood or vesture dipped
[51:55] in blood wrote on him the word of god
[51:57] he cometh the mighty conqueror yes sir
[52:01] to set up what to set up the millennium
[52:04] coming to the temple glory there he
[52:06] meets
[52:08] because see remember the 144 000 don't
[52:10] go to the marriage supper
[52:12] they're not bribed
[52:13] they're down here building the temple
[52:15] and once they get it built here we come
[52:17] back to meet
[52:19] the 144 thousand
[52:21] and they see us walking in and they go
[52:24] so this is what it's all about
[52:26] we've been we've been building this
[52:27] waiting on them to get here
[52:30] our great king david now why do we have
[52:32] to have a millennium
[52:34] we covered it a little bit but now
[52:35] remember i want you to think about this
[52:38] the millennium and the future home is
[52:41] different in one major point one major
[52:43] way
[52:44] everybody wake up a minute
[52:47] bob you gonna have trouble this
[52:48] afternoon buddy
[52:50] unless they take an unsleeping pill i
[52:52] don't know if you ever make one of those
[52:54] don't drink a monster
[52:57] i don't care if you fall asleep don't
[52:59] drink a monster
[53:00] stop drinking them things
[53:05] rebuke you right from the pulpit
[53:08] you either
[53:10] good job michael i wanted him to confess
[53:12] that
[53:14] it's okay you're all right
[53:16] okay we good
[53:17] i lost my whole train of thought
[53:20] what was i talking about
[53:21] people being asleep
[53:24] no listen
[53:26] i got it i know what i'm talking about
[53:28] the millennium is a time element so
[53:32] everything that happens in the
[53:33] millennium
[53:34] will have an end
[53:36] to it
[53:38] everything
[53:40] all right now future home
[53:44] is eternal
[53:45] and nothing will happen into it
[53:48] everybody got that
[53:49] because between
[53:50] the millennium and the thousand years
[53:53] you got a battle of gog and magog that's
[53:56] going to destroy the world again
[53:58] but this time it's going to destroy the
[54:00] demons
[54:01] it's going to destroy the beast and the
[54:03] false prophet
[54:06] then there's going to be a new city
[54:08] that'll never see there'll never be a
[54:10] change anymore after that
[54:12] that's the one that me and you now see
[54:14] that's where you and i we've waited that
[54:16] whole time
[54:17] because that's our city
[54:19] john topped the bride right
[54:21] john saw the city coming down out of
[54:23] heaven so it's coming from heaven from
[54:25] another dimension
[54:27] jesus said what behold i go prepare what
[54:30] place for you
[54:32] that where i
[54:33] am you will be there also that's not the
[54:35] millennium
[54:37] now see you can take that double it is
[54:39] talking about the millennium
[54:41] or you can take it a triple meaning he's
[54:43] with you now
[54:45] and then we go to the millennium but
[54:47] that's remember honeymoon but
[54:49] we're looking past that thousand years
[54:51] to that one home that he promised he'd
[54:53] build
[54:55] not me and you build he'll build it for
[54:57] us
[54:59] by what by your desires and we'll read
[55:01] that later on
[55:02] but as we read this remember
[55:06] the millennium is a time element it is
[55:09] in the old seventh day rest
[55:13] god created the world in six thousand
[55:15] years
[55:16] or six days
[55:18] and he rested on the seventh that is the
[55:20] millennium to the people so everybody
[55:23] got that
[55:24] so as we go through this
[55:26] be careful
[55:28] how you put this in
[55:30] because remember
[55:31] the new heavens and new earth that's
[55:33] coming down out from john
[55:35] is a different city
[55:37] than the city we're going to live in in
[55:38] the millennium remember the city in the
[55:40] millennium that we're going to live in
[55:42] was made by the jews the 144 thousand
[55:45] and it will be destroyed again because
[55:47] we won't need a temple didn't know what
[55:49] the bible says we'll get into that later
[55:50] on revelation says it won't need a light
[55:53] won't need a temple
[55:55] when we go to that new city there won't
[55:56] be any temples like that
[56:00] amen all right let's go to a second
[56:02] peter
[56:03] why do we have to have a thousand years
[56:07] ladies
[56:08] letting on front row why we have to have
[56:10] a thousand years
[56:14] okay i'm going to tell you
[56:16] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[56:18] thing that one day is where the lord is
[56:19] a thousand years and a thousand years is
[56:22] one day
[56:23] boy got you off the hook on that one
[56:24] didn't i all right let's go to the next
[56:26] scripture that tells us what this is all
[56:28] about
[56:31] look but of the tree of the of the
[56:34] knowledge of good and evil thou shall
[56:36] not eat now did they eat of that tree
[56:39] yes they did
[56:41] right
[56:42] and they died
[56:45] methuselah lived how long
[56:48] how much
[56:49] 969 he got close to a thousand
[56:54] adam was 900 methuselah
[56:57] all the different lamination all those
[56:58] different ones was 900 and can you
[57:00] imagine living 900 years
[57:03] brother dardy you imagine living 900
[57:07] he said about 80 is about good enough
[57:08] for you right
[57:11] for the day look for in the day
[57:14] now remember the day that they partook
[57:18] in the garden they did not die
[57:19] physically
[57:21] right
[57:23] they died
[57:24] spiritually
[57:26] because of this thing
[57:28] not in their soul but this thing fell
[57:30] all right for in the day that thou
[57:32] eatest thereof thou shalt surely
[57:35] die so they did partake of the tree of
[57:37] life
[57:38] they did eat from it
[57:41] and they never lived a thousand years
[57:44] anybody got that
[57:47] but
[57:48] to show that the sin curse is gone and
[57:51] that now a new eden has been restored
[57:55] man's going to live a thousand years
[57:57] so somebody's going to live a literal
[57:59] thousand calendar 360 day year
[58:02] so let's go to isaiah 65
[58:06] verse 17. for behold i create new
[58:08] heavens
[58:10] and a new earth there's not going to be
[58:11] a bunch of earths
[58:13] there are going to be a bunch of heavens
[58:15] but there's only one earth
[58:19] well behold that's what the bible says
[58:21] behold i will create new heavens and a
[58:23] new earth and the former shall not be
[58:25] remembered nor come into mind but be you
[58:27] glad and rejoice forever in that which i
[58:29] create for behold i create jerusalem
[58:31] rejoicing and her people enjoy
[58:35] now
[58:36] that's not jews
[58:38] i mean that's jews that's not gentiles
[58:43] so the millennium
[58:44] is to the jews
[58:46] i create jerusalem majority rejoice in
[58:48] our people joy listen you and i are
[58:50] going to be in eternal bodies
[58:53] no time element at all
[58:55] not going to matter to us how many days
[58:56] and weeks and months and years that we
[58:58] were there
[58:59] amen but what a paradox though because
[59:01] we're going to come down into the time
[59:02] element again we left the time element
[59:05] took a body change left the time element
[59:08] brought that body but listen what did
[59:09] jesus do
[59:12] what did jesus do
[59:15] he left time
[59:17] went to eternity
[59:19] come back down to time
[59:21] walked through a wall spent 30 40 days
[59:23] with him and ascended back up and he
[59:25] didn't get finished he'd come right back
[59:26] down again on the day of pentecost in
[59:28] the baptism of the holy ghost
[59:30] amen
[59:32] and i will rejoice in jerusalem and my
[59:34] joy and my people
[59:36] and the voice of weeping shall be no
[59:37] more hurt listen this promise
[59:40] in her nor the voice of crying there
[59:41] should be no more that's an infant of
[59:43] days
[59:44] nor an old man that has not filled his
[59:45] days now this part i'm telling you i'm
[59:48] just honest i don't understand where
[59:49] this fits in maybe some of you do and
[59:51] you can help me out with it i'll be sure
[59:53] appreciative of it
[59:55] for the child shall die 100 years old
[59:59] i don't brother brown said
[1:00:01] we don't die in the millennium so um
[1:00:04] but the center being 100 years old shall
[1:00:05] be accursed
[1:00:07] and they shall build houses
[1:00:09] and inhabit them and they shall plant
[1:00:11] vineyards and eat the fruit of them they
[1:00:14] shall not build in another inhabit in
[1:00:16] other words give it to another
[1:00:17] generation
[1:00:18] they shall not plant and another eat for
[1:00:20] as the days of a tree are the days of my
[1:00:22] people and my elect shall
[1:00:25] long enjoy the work of their hands
[1:00:30] they shall not labor in vain nor bring
[1:00:32] forth for trouble for they are the seed
[1:00:34] of the blessed of the lord and their
[1:00:35] offspring with them look and it shall
[1:00:37] come to pass that before they call i
[1:00:39] will answer
[1:00:40] while they are yet speaking i will hear
[1:00:42] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[1:00:43] together in the line shall eat straw
[1:00:44] like the bullet
[1:00:46] and dust shall be the serpent's meat
[1:00:48] man we got rid of them in the millennium
[1:00:50] i thought we could get rhythm snakes i
[1:00:52] just thought snakes wouldn't be there
[1:00:56] i don't like snakes
[1:00:58] i do i like them in two pieces
[1:01:01] they shall not hurt nor destroy and all
[1:01:03] my holy mountain
[1:01:05] saith the lord
[1:01:07] he's restoring it back
[1:01:09] now let's go to isaiah 66 22
[1:01:14] for as the new heavens there it is again
[1:01:15] and the new earth which i will make
[1:01:18] shall remain before me saith the lord so
[1:01:20] shall your seed and your name remain and
[1:01:23] it shall come to pass it from one new
[1:01:24] moon to another now look that's got to
[1:01:26] be time
[1:01:28] okay
[1:01:29] that's got to be time because you got
[1:01:30] new moons and you've got so what is a
[1:01:32] new moon it's a month
[1:01:34] it's 30 days you know what i'm talking
[1:01:35] about
[1:01:38] which i will make shall remain before me
[1:01:40] saith the lord so shall your seed
[1:01:42] and your name remain and it shall come
[1:01:44] to pass that from one new moon to
[1:01:45] another and from one sabbath to another
[1:01:50] look shall all flesh come to worship
[1:01:52] before me saith the lord
[1:01:54] and they shall go forth and look upon
[1:01:56] the carcass of the men that have
[1:01:57] transgressed against me for the worm
[1:01:59] shall not die neither shall their fire
[1:02:00] be quenched and they shall be an
[1:02:02] abhorring unto all flesh now the only
[1:02:05] thing i can tell you this i'm just going
[1:02:06] to stick this in
[1:02:08] is that if it's a nuclear war
[1:02:12] there's still going to be people laying
[1:02:13] around
[1:02:15] i'm that's but
[1:02:17] i mean you look said used to look on the
[1:02:18] carcass of the men that have
[1:02:19] transgressed against me that's the only
[1:02:21] way you can place it in there
[1:02:24] because it's not going to kill it i mean
[1:02:26] it's going to kill everybody but it's
[1:02:27] not there's going to be a lot of things
[1:02:28] left as far as i'm concerned
[1:02:30] if it's an atomic explosion it's not
[1:02:33] going to level the whole world
[1:02:35] there's going to be stuff still here
[1:02:36] because they got to build that
[1:02:37] millennium temple with something
[1:02:39] okay so let's go to jeremiah
[1:02:42] 33 verse 10.
[1:02:45] thus saith the lord again there shall be
[1:02:47] heard in this place now watch this right
[1:02:49] here
[1:02:50] which ye say shall be desolate without
[1:02:52] man and beast
[1:02:54] even in the cities of judah and in the
[1:02:56] streets of jerusalem that are desolate
[1:02:58] without man without inhabitant and
[1:03:00] without beast
[1:03:01] now
[1:03:03] that's got to be after the battle of
[1:03:05] armageddon
[1:03:06] when the streets are empty but what's
[1:03:07] going to happen they're going to come
[1:03:09] back watch the voice of joy
[1:03:12] and the voice of gladness the voice of
[1:03:14] the bridegroom and the voice of the
[1:03:15] bride that's me and you that is not
[1:03:17] israel amen
[1:03:20] the voice of them that shall say praise
[1:03:22] the lord of host
[1:03:23] for the lord is good for his mercy
[1:03:25] endureth forever
[1:03:26] and of them that shall bring the
[1:03:27] sacrifice of praise into the house of
[1:03:29] the lord for i will cause to return look
[1:03:33] the captivity of the land
[1:03:35] that's that 50th jubilee
[1:03:38] everything's turned back
[1:03:40] for i will cause to return the captivity
[1:03:42] of the land
[1:03:44] as at the first
[1:03:47] saith the lord all right thus saith the
[1:03:49] lord of hosts again in this place which
[1:03:51] is desolate without man without beasts
[1:03:53] and all the cities shall be inhabitation
[1:03:55] of shepherds causing their flocks to lie
[1:03:58] down wow
[1:04:00] in the cities of the mountains and in
[1:04:01] the cities of the vale look cities
[1:04:04] there's going to be an economy
[1:04:06] we're not just going to have one city
[1:04:08] that's where mew and i are going to be
[1:04:10] but there'll be other places because
[1:04:12] they're going to build houses
[1:04:14] and in the cities of the south in the
[1:04:15] land of benjamin
[1:04:17] and in the places about jerusalem and in
[1:04:19] the cities of judah
[1:04:20] shall the flocks pass again under the
[1:04:22] hands of him that telleth them saith the
[1:04:24] lord behold the day comes
[1:04:26] saith the lord that i will perform that
[1:04:28] good thing which i have promised
[1:04:31] unto the house of israel listen
[1:04:33] they hold to those promises because
[1:04:35] that's all they got in the old testament
[1:04:38] they have no new testament promise they
[1:04:39] don't even believe in the new testament
[1:04:41] so they have to go back to the old
[1:04:42] testament and look at all these promises
[1:04:44] that god's going to raise them up one
[1:04:46] day
[1:04:47] all right
[1:04:48] i will perform that good thing which i
[1:04:49] have promised unto the house of israel
[1:04:52] and to the house of judah in those days
[1:04:54] and at that time will i cause the branch
[1:04:56] of righteousness to grow up unto david
[1:04:59] and he shall execute judgment and
[1:05:01] righteousness
[1:05:02] in the land
[1:05:04] in those days shall judah be saved and
[1:05:05] jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is
[1:05:08] the name wherewith she shall be called
[1:05:11] the lord our righteousness for thus
[1:05:13] saith the lord david shall never want a
[1:05:15] man to sin upon the throne
[1:05:17] of the house of israel god thought so
[1:05:19] much of david
[1:05:22] that he was called the son of david
[1:05:24] and he was promised that he would sit
[1:05:27] as david on the throne ruling what
[1:05:31] 12 tribes of israel he's not ruling over
[1:05:33] us
[1:05:34] right he's not ruling no rush he's
[1:05:36] ruling over the 12 tribes of israel
[1:05:41] now let's go to the chart just for a
[1:05:42] second if you'll pull that up and then
[1:05:43] we'll be then we'll stop right here
[1:05:47] because we'll talk about david next next
[1:05:49] week
[1:05:50] because that's some really good stuff
[1:05:52] about
[1:05:52] israel as a nation
[1:05:54] the time of the millennium
[1:05:56] but just keep this in mind as we go any
[1:05:58] further
[1:06:00] if you hear anything of time
[1:06:03] it's in the millennium
[1:06:06] and some of it's going to end some of
[1:06:08] it's going to be blown up again some of
[1:06:09] it's going to go away now the future
[1:06:11] home once it sits on the earth it's done
[1:06:14] for for eternity there's nothing going
[1:06:17] to happen different everybody got that
[1:06:20] all right so now where are we
[1:06:23] blow that up
[1:06:24] right here please
[1:06:28] come this way
[1:06:31] no i'm sorry this way there you go
[1:06:35] so now you've got the battle of
[1:06:36] armageddon
[1:06:37] revelations 19
[1:06:39] battle of armageddon purging of the
[1:06:41] earth
[1:06:42] revelations 21-7
[1:06:45] this is going to be
[1:06:46] the 1000 years
[1:06:50] of millennial reign
[1:06:52] two prophets 144 000
[1:06:55] and us are going to live before the
[1:06:57] battle of gog and magog everybody got
[1:06:59] that so that's the position that we're
[1:07:00] in so let's read this real quick
[1:07:02] revelations 20 verse one
[1:07:05] and then we'll stop right here
[1:07:10] give him a second to get back to it
[1:07:14] revelations 20 verse 1. and i saw an
[1:07:17] angel come down from heaven having the
[1:07:18] key of the bottomless pit
[1:07:20] and a great chain in his hand so
[1:07:22] something's got to happen when we start
[1:07:24] coming down
[1:07:25] when i say down you know i don't mean
[1:07:28] we're up on a platform somewhere i mean
[1:07:30] when we come out of this dimen another
[1:07:31] dimension into this dimension slower or
[1:07:34] faster
[1:07:35] we're going to come in like this and
[1:07:36] come into that temple
[1:07:38] somewhere though
[1:07:41] satan's going to have to be bound
[1:07:42] because remember
[1:07:44] he had a lot to do with the battle of
[1:07:45] armageddon
[1:07:47] because he's actually the only one that
[1:07:49] hadn't had to do with the battle of
[1:07:50] armageddon
[1:07:51] and man it was his forces against his
[1:07:53] forces
[1:07:54] bless his heart he can't even win he's
[1:07:56] fighting against himself
[1:07:57] amen and that's good because he's going
[1:07:59] to lose
[1:08:00] i saw an angel come down from heaven
[1:08:02] having the key to the bottomless pit and
[1:08:03] a great chain in his hand and he laid
[1:08:05] hold on the dragon
[1:08:07] that old serpent which is the devil and
[1:08:10] satan now look that's not three people
[1:08:11] or four that's one
[1:08:14] and bound him a thousand years
[1:08:19] and cast him into the bottomless pit and
[1:08:21] shut him up and set a seal
[1:08:23] upon him that he should
[1:08:25] deceive the nations
[1:08:27] no more
[1:08:29] till the thousand years should be
[1:08:30] fulfilled
[1:08:32] after that
[1:08:33] he must be loosed
[1:08:35] a low season
[1:08:37] and i saw thrones and they just sat on
[1:08:39] them and judgment was given we'll get
[1:08:40] into that next week
[1:08:42] because then you got the battle of gog
[1:08:44] and magog and then you've got the
[1:08:45] judgment and i saw the souls of them
[1:08:47] that were beheaded for the witness of
[1:08:48] jesus and for the word of god which had
[1:08:50] not worshipped the beast neither his
[1:08:52] image neither had received his mark upon
[1:08:54] their forehead or in their hands and
[1:08:56] they lived and reigned with christ
[1:08:58] one thousand years
[1:08:59] but the rest of the dead if you don't
[1:09:00] get born again and you pass away you
[1:09:02] will not be seen in that thousand years
[1:09:06] everybody got that
[1:09:07] you're not coming up as
[1:09:09] anything
[1:09:11] the rest of the dead lived not again
[1:09:13] until the thousand years were finished
[1:09:16] this is the first resurrection blessed
[1:09:19] and holy as he that hath part in the
[1:09:21] first resurrection on such the second
[1:09:23] death hath no power
[1:09:26] what's the second death god's going to
[1:09:28] kill your soul
[1:09:31] it may be millions of years and billions
[1:09:32] of years but one day your soul is just
[1:09:34] going to
[1:09:35] be nothing
[1:09:37] it will be void of god
[1:09:39] never to be remembered again
[1:09:43] and you decide whether you want to take
[1:09:44] that path or not
[1:09:47] because god doesn't want to he don't
[1:09:48] want you to take that path
[1:09:50] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:09:52] the first resurrection on such the
[1:09:53] second death hath no power
[1:09:57] but they shall be priests of god and of
[1:09:58] christ and shall reign with him
[1:10:01] one thousand years
[1:10:03] one
[1:10:04] thousand
[1:10:06] years
[1:10:07] he shall reign
