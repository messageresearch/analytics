[10:29] scriptures turn to Leviticus 23 and we
[10:33] will just read our scriptures and
[10:34] continue our thought trying to get to a
[10:37] position to understand father we thank
[10:40] you for the opportunity that we have
[10:43] that we can come together for at this
[10:47] time we can still fellowship together
[10:49] around thy word and we pray that Lord as
[10:53] the days and the times approaches of all
[10:55] of the things coming up on the earth
[10:58] that you would take care of everything
[11:00] be were the people Lord of all people of
[11:02] the world a lot of these viruses and
[11:04] things
[11:05] Lord all of that just people dying on
[11:08] ever hand and in order we ask you to
[11:11] just be with each one and got each one
[11:13] investor Church the people that's the
[11:16] little bride around the world if she
[11:18] endeavors for you and just have you away
[11:21] with each one of us we love you and we
[11:23] thank you as we speak your word you come
[11:26] and speak to our hearts in Jesus name
[11:28] Amen let's just read a few verses here
[11:34] we'll go was going to the 17th well what
[11:37] we'll do is we'll just read Leviticus 23
[11:43] 9 and then about 12 then we'll jump over
[11:48] to 17 okay and the Lord spake unto Moses
[11:52] saying speak unto the children of Israel
[11:54] and say unto them when you be coming to
[11:58] the land now this is when Israel was
[12:01] actually already in participating and
[12:04] coming into Canaan the land of promise
[12:07] cause Canaan as the top of the baptism
[12:10] of the Holy Ghost so the reason I'm
[12:12] saying that away see then when you start
[12:14] making these things you'll see it says
[12:16] firstfruits
[12:17] well the firstfruits is a baptism with
[12:19] the Holy Ghost so this is entering into
[12:22] the land and when you get incoming into
[12:24] the land and things you do these things
[12:26] in ioan you'll see that it works out
[12:29] good see speaking to the children of
[12:31] Israel and said to them when you come
[12:33] into the land which I give unto you and
[12:36] shall reap the harvest thereof then you
[12:39] don't have to plant remember when they
[12:42] entered into Canaan they didn't have to
[12:44] plant they they gathered that year
[12:48] because it was already it was a time of
[12:50] the harvest alright so then they they
[12:53] were ready and they got to either the
[12:56] old corner of the land and when they did
[13:00] you remember what happened the old
[13:02] corner of the land is exactly what this
[13:04] is talking about - she's waving the
[13:05] different things you know together into
[13:07] the fruit to harvest and when it does
[13:09] they were allowed to eat of the old corn
[13:13] of the land and when they did the manna
[13:16] ceased
[13:18] the manna ceased read you Bible and as
[13:21] it ceased the then it went into the the
[13:25] deeper depth of the Word of God is the
[13:29] best way to say it because manna was the
[13:31] top of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:33] therein Kanaan's land this is to happen
[13:36] and then it's coming forth telling you
[13:38] what to do and he says then you shall
[13:40] bring a sheaf of the first fruits of
[13:42] your harvest unto the priest and he
[13:45] shall weigh the sheath before the Lord
[13:46] to be accepted for you on the morrow
[13:50] after the Sabbath now when it's going to
[13:52] be what gonna be on the eighth day they
[13:54] ain't gonna be on the Sabbath then all
[13:57] right
[13:57] donar tomorrow after the Sabbath the
[14:00] priest shall wave it and you shall offer
[14:02] that day when you wave the sheaf and he
[14:07] lamb without blemish of the first year
[14:10] for a burnt offering unto the Lord let's
[14:13] just drop over save time verse 17 and he
[14:16] shall bring out of your habitations now
[14:19] this is coming more into is is gathering
[14:24] this is the sheaf wave we'll see what
[14:27] that is but now the petite the people
[14:30] how something to participate because
[14:33] she's well you're gonna find out it's
[14:34] one person the priest goes out in waves
[14:38] of sheath but then it goes into the
[14:41] families or the people the group see and
[14:44] then once and you shall bring out of
[14:46] your habitation to wave loaves of two
[14:50] tents deal they shall be a fine flour
[14:53] they shall be baited bacon with leaven
[14:57] they are the firstfruits unto the Lord
[15:00] you may be seated
[15:02] Lord have his blessings to the word
[15:06] alright now what we want to do is this
[15:11] is it may not sound like it or you'd
[15:15] think about it but all of this is coming
[15:17] toward a climax of what I've been
[15:21] speaking on and what has been that point
[15:26] that the bride of Jesus Christ will be
[15:31] the Son of Man the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:35] manifested in human flesh in the last
[15:38] days that's her promise we'll get to
[15:41] that we'll get over weekend we'll get
[15:43] over into Revelations one where it says
[15:47] one standing in the midst of the seven
[15:48] golden candlesticks like under the Son
[15:50] of Man Girt about the paps so you coming
[15:52] into bride form all right so we wanted
[15:55] to try to bring everything over into a
[15:57] bride form but we've got to cover this
[15:59] and get it into the right place of
[16:01] understanding and seeing that the bride
[16:05] then will be the fullness of the Godhead
[16:07] bodily
[16:09] you said well that's just too much no
[16:11] that's not too much that's what the
[16:13] Bible says about us and that's what I'm
[16:16] doing here is taking this example of the
[16:20] entering into the Promised Land and when
[16:23] they begin you know they went into the
[16:25] cane and the promised land and as they
[16:27] did the then they didn't have to plant
[16:32] they they went into the time of the
[16:35] harvest all right and each person would
[16:39] take in any setup of tradition I'm not a
[16:42] traditional Oh a commandment from God
[16:46] that ever from then on every year it
[16:49] would be the same way so this would be
[16:52] the example as for to Israel to do and
[16:56] they're they're doing here and in it
[16:58] what's that the example for what the
[16:59] next year would be the next you know and
[17:02] we'll keep on going all right joy
[17:04] they're entering into the Promised Land
[17:07] then there to take us a sheath all right
[17:11] now I'm gonna say this the best way I
[17:15] can for you to understand you're gonna
[17:19] have to see that the the priest the high
[17:22] priest would would do this it was told
[17:26] for him to take that the priest was to
[17:28] take this and do it it wasn't 99 priests
[17:31] out there now offering for this without
[17:33] of the other on the first one I don't
[17:35] believe I believe the sheath wave was
[17:38] the / the priests waving that one sheath
[17:42] for the whole land
[17:45] but now from then on ever head of the
[17:50] family would have to bring a sheath
[17:55] because see here you're not talking
[17:58] about get you're not talking about that
[18:00] you planted it and then you're gonna go
[18:02] out and you're gonna gather it the
[18:04] second year and from then on that's what
[18:06] it is you plant your crop it grows up
[18:09] before you go out and gather it you take
[18:12] what's called the firstfruits and and
[18:14] you go out there and you get a handful
[18:16] of wheat and you take it into the priest
[18:19] you know and he would wave it before the
[18:23] Lord showing that your harvest is fixing
[18:28] to come all right so get what I'm
[18:31] talking about it for the children of
[18:32] Israel and all that first one it would
[18:34] take many many days to go through the
[18:37] waving in the sheath so I'm trying to
[18:39] show you the what I think happened was
[18:42] when they entered the land the high
[18:46] priest gathered not from ever field and
[18:51] all of that and it's not necessarily
[18:53] because it'd be tying up too much time
[18:56] but he would go out and he would gather
[18:59] that wheat that that handful and he
[19:03] would wave that before the Lord showing
[19:06] what they're to do now the next year the
[19:10] next year you're responsible you have to
[19:13] go out you have to get your sheath you
[19:17] have to do that take it to the priest
[19:19] and then he waves it this one the priest
[19:22] probably went out and took it because it
[19:24] was in to the land because that's what
[19:26] it said in the scripture there as we're
[19:28] reading them what speaking to the
[19:30] children in this engine when you see
[19:31] enter into the land which I given to you
[19:33] you reap the harvest thereof that you
[19:35] know bring a sheaf of the first fruits
[19:37] of your harvest unto the priest and he's
[19:41] your way all right so it would just be
[19:43] one thing to represent the whole thing
[19:45] but from then on it would turn out to be
[19:47] for you you've got to bring it take it
[19:51] to your priest and do it because all of
[19:53] that wood will tie together all right
[19:55] then it winds up to be
[19:58] same sheath that is way before the Lord
[20:02] it winds up being two loaves as we've
[20:07] said in the 17th verse er it winds up to
[20:10] be two loaves and we'll get to that in
[20:13] on end of the message because I believe
[20:16] that that's bringing it through the
[20:18] point of bride form all right no that's
[20:22] that's what I believe I believe when you
[20:23] come to the two loaves you're coming to
[20:25] bride form
[20:26] you got your sieve you've got your
[20:29] priests you got your offerings now
[20:31] you're coming to the point of the two
[20:34] loaves and you know that that way it
[20:37] would will tie together but all right
[20:40] now that's what we want to talk about
[20:41] but the main thing of what I want to
[20:44] talk to you about is to make sure you
[20:46] follow the lineup that I've been doing
[20:48] for months and months to talk about the
[20:52] bride of Jesus Christ being the son of
[20:54] man all right and windup being the
[20:58] fullness of the Godhead bodily in the
[21:02] bride of Jesus Christ
[21:03] all right now not in one member not in
[21:07] one doing we covered that the son of man
[21:09] wouldn't be one Church age it's all
[21:13] seven church ages the son of man comes
[21:16] for from there even though he's under
[21:18] the dispensation back gar of son of God
[21:21] and not manifest in that much maybe in
[21:25] those days but he's hitting he comes in
[21:27] to the son of man and you understand is
[21:30] coming to the maturity it's like I said
[21:34] about when they entered the land they
[21:36] were allowed to eat of the old corn of
[21:39] the land which they didn't plant it they
[21:43] didn't do anything they went out and
[21:44] gathered it okay so when they went out
[21:48] and gathered it see then they would take
[21:51] that and wave it before the Lord and
[21:53] then they could eat that and it would be
[21:56] called the old corner of the land and
[21:58] when it does your mana in reading
[22:00] scripture your manner that was with the
[22:02] children of Israel down through their
[22:04] journey eating each day and everything
[22:07] that manna ceased
[22:09] you'd say well why did it sees it cease
[22:12] because it became a stronger maturity
[22:15] see they entered the land you understand
[22:19] they went into Canaan they went out here
[22:22] in the wilderness running around playing
[22:23] about they had entered the land of
[22:26] Canaan
[22:27] all right then they go out and they see
[22:29] the fields ready and they say what do we
[22:31] do in the priest says oh no wait a
[22:33] minute and God said okay Moses this is
[22:34] what you do take the high priest and let
[22:38] him wave for one and then we won't stand
[22:40] everybody because at that time once they
[22:43] entered the land they didn't have the
[22:45] land divided so you wouldn't know what
[22:47] lands you're to wave your seasons on but
[22:50] as it went on they begin to divide the
[22:53] land up and set it aside for each group
[22:55] all right but that hopper you see when
[22:58] he waved that sheath before the Lord
[23:00] it was the showing of the harvest or the
[23:04] time was at hand now think about what
[23:07] I'm saying and if you'll study it you'll
[23:09] see there's seven days between this
[23:12] waving of the sheaf and then you get on
[23:14] over to the bar lives and different
[23:16] things and the loaves you're gonna have
[23:21] to put about seven days in there so what
[23:24] you do is it's you know maybe maybe you
[23:28] never raise wheat or anything like that
[23:30] as much or around barley or or anything
[23:34] but say you raise cotton or you raise
[23:37] corn you go out there and you plant your
[23:41] crop which is always a certain spot in
[23:45] that garden that comes before all the
[23:49] rest some reason for the for the we call
[23:55] it fertilizing or the ground that has
[23:57] been in the ground or something to be
[23:59] there there's a certain spot of that
[24:01] garden always with tours first all right
[24:05] so that's what you're talking about you
[24:07] go out and you don't just reach around
[24:09] the edge of the field and grab a sign
[24:10] here hip reasons no you look around over
[24:13] the whole field and you find a place
[24:15] that here is all the other things
[24:17] running on a good level especially with
[24:19] wheat and you just stand and look and
[24:21] especially you go out west and you stand
[24:22] and look
[24:23] and man you can just look for 10 miles
[24:25] and and it looks like every stalk is the
[24:27] same size but you got to remember there
[24:31] are spots in there that was a head of
[24:34] the others that's what I want you to get
[24:35] because I believe the the waving of the
[24:42] sheath is in representation of the first
[24:46] one to come to maturity and I wholly and
[24:49] we'll get to it and back up over it and
[24:51] keep saying it
[24:52] I believe brother Branham was the first
[24:54] one in our day to come to maturity now I
[24:56] believe that I've always taught that
[24:58] I've always believed he was the first
[24:59] one to come to maturity all right you
[25:03] know being the Prophet being the
[25:05] bringing the message and then we'll get
[25:07] on into the message and see that it
[25:10] comes to a point that there's going to
[25:13] be a sheaf waved in the last days now
[25:17] that's what we want to get to it a
[25:18] minute but I want to make sure you get
[25:20] the background foundation so you see
[25:22] that you see the situation you enter
[25:25] into the land the lands already with our
[25:27] maturity it's ready the high priests
[25:30] Moses tells him he goes out he looks
[25:34] around and he sees a spot that's taller
[25:36] than the other which is recent maturity
[25:38] quicker you know for some reason and the
[25:41] natural more fertilizer more sunlight
[25:44] more whatever you know more water but he
[25:47] goes into there and he takes a handful
[25:49] and he waves that before the Lord all
[25:54] right then they can gather I think you
[25:59] seven days later from the time of his
[26:01] waving I believe this correct would
[26:03] wouldn't matter but he huh
[26:04] there's a time between his gathering of
[26:06] the priests and the waving you know I'll
[26:08] be caught it would represent to seven
[26:10] churches right but here then now you can
[26:13] go out and you don't have any land you
[26:16] know it's not set aside yet for you to
[26:19] to have your piece of property but
[26:22] everybody can just go out and gather and
[26:25] they can cook it and you know whatever
[26:28] they do and that is the old corn of the
[26:31] land it's already matured all right your
[26:35] manna ceases
[26:36] because mana you said yeah but man it
[26:38] was the top of the word does the word
[26:40] cease no no don't get that in your ideas
[26:43] the the mana became the old corn or
[26:49] which way you said the old corn becomes
[26:51] a man I guess I don't know which way you
[26:52] won't say it but it would wind up being
[26:54] that that mana you know would cease away
[26:59] because it's coming into maturity of the
[27:03] old corn all right and that old corn
[27:07] shows adoption statue of a perfect man
[27:10] shows the things you are in your
[27:12] Christian journey because you've entered
[27:15] the promised land which is the baptism
[27:17] of the Holy Ghost the new birth and you
[27:20] you're offering your sheaf and you're
[27:22] you're doing the things that you're
[27:23] supposed to be doing and as it does it
[27:26] just keeps increasing and you come up to
[27:28] the old corner of the land then you can
[27:30] can go and just keep on traveling
[27:32] throughout the Word of God all right so
[27:34] you follow what I'm talking about
[27:36] all right so now that first one to come
[27:40] to maturity the first part of your field
[27:44] or garden whatever the wheat that was
[27:47] there the part first part of kind of
[27:50] maturity iris where the priest would go
[27:51] and get that handful and he'd go wave it
[27:56] before the Lord now what's he waving
[27:58] that before the Lord far come on what's
[28:04] he waving it before the Lord for to show
[28:08] that there's a whole field out there not
[28:12] to just show the the well the Lord has
[28:15] given us this wheat and given us this
[28:17] land that's a good that's real good all
[28:19] of those things are great but the main
[28:21] thing to me is when he weighs that
[28:24] before the Lord now you can go into the
[28:26] two loaves because you can take that in
[28:30] and cook it all right then you've got
[28:34] something to eat all right now you've
[28:37] got the old corn of the land that you're
[28:39] able to eat it and it becomes a part of
[28:42] you okay all right see then the point is
[28:46] what the sheath is proof that there's
[28:49] coming
[28:50] a field keep that in your mind now the
[28:53] sheaf itself waving you see you can
[28:56] argue about this with the first and that
[28:57] was for i believe brother branham was
[28:59] the first in our day to come to maturity
[29:01] i agree with that i believe but really
[29:04] the Lord Jesus Christ is the first to
[29:06] come to maturity because you back up
[29:08] back there and come into the ages and
[29:11] the things with this getting the point I
[29:13] believe it I believe brother Branham was
[29:14] the first one in our day to come to
[29:16] maturity which you know what that meant
[29:19] more was coming they don't mean well run
[29:24] around and I don't mean this wrong of
[29:25] people who said it you know that all God
[29:29] was he poured into Christ and all Christ
[29:31] into brother branham and brother Brown
[29:32] died and took it with him we got nothing
[29:34] now I don't agree with that I never have
[29:36] never never cared about that statement
[29:38] to me it's derogatory to the entire
[29:40] Bible slanderous to the Word of God to
[29:43] bring it in that order but I believe
[29:46] brother Branham was the first one right
[29:48] but he was wave showing that others were
[29:51] coming all right you want these quotes
[29:53] from brother Branham he said in the days
[29:55] of the prophets news is plural in the
[30:02] days of the prophets this is this day
[30:06] not if you and I gonna be prophets they
[30:09] ain't gonna new it it's in the days of
[30:11] the maturity all right so that's what it
[30:14] is see that that sheaf represents the
[30:16] what's coming it ain't enough to feed
[30:20] the whole people these it means that
[30:26] it's ready it means you can go to you
[30:29] feel now like I said they may be a
[30:33] seven-day period between this day that
[30:35] matches up to that to be just right to
[30:37] where it'll follow correctly on the
[30:38] eighth day but still it when he waves
[30:41] that sheath before the Lord to be
[30:46] accepted it means Moore's coming of the
[30:51] same wheat all right see that's what
[30:54] happened under there Pentecost go into
[30:56] this arising to the Sun I got about six
[30:59] pages in here I topped off on it but we
[31:02] won't get to that
[31:03] but you do it yourself go ahead it's the
[31:05] rising of the Sun go in there and study
[31:08] those study masterpiece steady ceding
[31:11] out our with a shook bringing all of
[31:13] those messages and begin to read them
[31:15] and you'll see that it all represents
[31:18] that there's a maturity yes thank God
[31:23] for the maturity of the one that brought
[31:25] the message in the end which is to be in
[31:27] this day to be delivered of an uber from
[31:30] according to Malachi 4 alright see
[31:37] brother branham was that one chief way
[31:39] right perfect but it meant there was
[31:42] more to come of the same kind we don't
[31:47] have to worry about whether what all you
[31:49] think we're all prophets well why don't
[31:51] you think that we're more than just
[31:54] garbage cans you know I mean like I've
[32:00] always said it like this if David if
[32:03] David under the blood of bulls and goats
[32:05] could whooping lie on the burner and a
[32:07] giant if he didn't needed to he could
[32:09] have put them all together at one time
[32:10] whooped all of them wouldn't make no
[32:12] difference right you agree with well you
[32:15] know what you think to do that without
[32:17] the baptism with the holy holy ghost
[32:19] what would it be he would have told Saul
[32:22] and then say hey y'all go on back home
[32:24] I'll take care of this thing myself
[32:27] and he could have done it under the
[32:29] blood of Jesus Christ but you see what
[32:33] I'm talking about now the first one to
[32:35] come to maturity sure the Lord Jesus
[32:37] Christ let's get the story right now and
[32:40] run it through the Lord Jesus Christ is
[32:43] the first one that came to maturity and
[32:45] he had a death burn a resurrection and
[32:48] rose up and was waived brother Brown
[32:51] said on the day of Pentecost over the
[32:55] rest what wave to show others were
[32:57] coming it wasn't going to be just for
[33:01] him it would be others to come forth of
[33:04] the same form of wheat alright
[33:09] and see bringing it into the to do that
[33:12] we can enjoy the old corner of the land
[33:14] I really enjoy reading the Word of God
[33:17] from where I can study it now compared
[33:20] to where I was you know 40 years ago or
[33:23] something trying to to understand the
[33:25] message in and listening to the things
[33:28] you know even back the end of of trying
[33:30] to understand the prophet in the way he
[33:31] would be talking and you'd look at
[33:33] things but I know what this went through
[33:35] see everybody preached that way even
[33:38] more they preach brother Branham brother
[33:39] Branham was waved over brother Branham
[33:41] brother Branham well okay no problem
[33:48] we got that right no problem
[33:50] he's the first one in our day to come to
[33:53] majority no problem but worse the rest
[33:56] of us of the wheat God if he was
[34:02] accepted and we know backing up putting
[34:04] it well brother on him and the Lord
[34:05] Jesus try to understand the Lord Jesus
[34:07] was accepted for you and I to prove that
[34:13] more wheat was coming all right
[34:17] he was the first to come to maturity he
[34:21] was God himself in human flesh but he's
[34:26] showing there's more to come
[34:29] think about it so you think well well I
[34:31] I just can't see myself in the word why
[34:35] not I see you in every scripture of the
[34:38] word he'll run around city you can't see
[34:42] Christ in every verse he just say Jesus
[34:45] now cuz that would be fleshling you get
[34:47] too much but he said Christ in every
[34:49] verse he said go back read again you
[34:51] missed it see we can study the Word of
[34:55] God that people have never thought about
[34:56] we could look at the 10 commandments and
[34:59] read them and they got him out here on
[35:01] the road they got him on the house on
[35:02] the barns they got him on the churches
[35:04] and done before we got it we can read
[35:08] that Ten Commandments and see brother
[35:09] Brown the cities the seals because the
[35:15] Ten Commandments with God in human flesh
[35:19] produced by what
[35:22] the prophets brought the word the word
[35:26] brought the body of Jesus Christ brought
[35:30] him into being all right and see we
[35:33] could look back at that and see that and
[35:36] see those things to see what was
[35:38] promised to come
[35:40] well I now if he was the fullness of the
[35:43] Godhead bodily
[35:46] why don't we believe it right we believe
[35:49] the Lord Jesus Christ fullness of the
[35:51] Godhead bodily
[35:52] all right and brother brother said God
[35:55] is not complete without you so there's
[36:00] got to be some parts of these things put
[36:02] together and where are we and the
[36:08] Prophet said is to be waved again in the
[36:12] last days from according to Malachi 4
[36:14] Luke 17 31 the Lord Jesus raised up and
[36:21] was waved over the people showing that
[36:24] he was coming back in a few days he was
[36:29] gonna fill those people with the baptism
[36:31] with the holy go now you got you feel
[36:34] now you got you you're what you need you
[36:38] got the body of Christ
[36:40] you got the Bride of Christ you got
[36:44] heard then to her that she can be all it
[36:46] now it's like I said now I'll keep
[36:50] making statements cuz I want you to not
[36:52] to miss I don't want you to
[36:53] misunderstand me
[36:54] cuz you see you can't have the first
[36:58] church age and let it be this on a man
[37:02] you can't have the seventh church age
[37:04] and let it be the son of man you've got
[37:10] seven churches it takes to build the
[37:13] body of Jesus Christ right the wife the
[37:17] body and in doing that then there is
[37:20] your seed we'll get to the next one
[37:23] we're going to pick up the the
[37:26] masterpiece and seating out our with a
[37:28] joke and put another message behind this
[37:30] one but I want you to say it he then
[37:34] whatever he was we are
[37:37] right and he come he waved goodbye
[37:42] brother Brennan said but a few days
[37:46] later he came back to fill that bride
[37:51] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:54] making her what he is bringing her to
[38:00] that maybe not into full maturity back
[38:02] there now because it takes those ages to
[38:05] make the maturity sure we've got an age
[38:07] we're at a time we're overhearing in
[38:10] this day but we're not in lady ousia
[38:14] he's or whatever the world is in lady of
[38:17] SIA
[38:19] we're in goshen there was plenty of
[38:24] people in Egypt but the little bride was
[38:28] down in Goshen the children of Israel
[38:30] there's plenty of religious situations
[38:33] around the world which there's a little
[38:35] bride she's gonna come to maturity and
[38:40] be as the Prophet said no leaven among
[38:42] you because you got to keep that real
[38:44] close in your scripture because you've
[38:45] got one offering that goes with an
[38:47] unleavened bread all right you got
[38:51] another offering that goes with eleven
[38:53] in the bread matter of fact this is the
[38:55] one you say yeah but but but but what
[39:02] but brother Darwyn you you can't how no
[39:04] leaven the Bible says to make it would
[39:06] 11 do you think you've got to understand
[39:12] what's being done one of them is a
[39:14] certain way and way it's bad you can't
[39:17] have leaven in it because you can't have
[39:18] no leaven in the bride of Jesus Christ
[39:22] but you can how now listen to one of the
[39:25] best seconds but in our human flesh we
[39:27] have leaven in our spirit realms we have
[39:31] leaven this keeps messing everything up
[39:36] you didn't listen uh turn 11 you know
[39:39] what living you got living and unliving
[39:41] and you don't understand my wordings in
[39:44] this best thing on gay news gives you a
[39:46] good old dictionary look at
[39:48] you know because you see you don't
[39:51] there's no in cooking there's things
[39:54] that's cooked without living the
[39:56] communion bread is cooked without leaven
[40:01] no leaven in it to make the communion
[40:04] bread why because that's got that
[40:06] certain but here the two loaves well
[40:11] let's read it
[40:13] look what this is and he shall bring out
[40:17] of your habitations two loaves of
[40:20] two-tenths deal and they shall be a fine
[40:23] flour they shall be bacon with leaven
[40:30] they are the firstfruits unto the Lord
[40:33] now the firstfruits is a bride of Jesus
[40:34] Christ we are the firstfruits
[40:36] firstfruits the baptism of the holy God
[40:39] now the best way I can say it to put it
[40:43] in understanding to keep it right with
[40:45] me
[40:45] like I said there is one that's
[40:48] unleavened that's got that certain
[40:52] meaning to it that nothing can be added
[40:54] to it all right but then you've got some
[40:58] that is that is what leaven in
[41:00] situations that in our natural bodies
[41:03] and spirit realm today we still have
[41:06] problems and there's leaven in there
[41:10] that's why it's so hard for someone to
[41:12] understand and and one time they said
[41:15] something about that and I can't find
[41:18] this one we're talking about the two
[41:21] lows said brother Branham said the Tim
[41:23] Jews couldn't understand them two lows
[41:25] well I understand why they can
[41:29] understand why they can't understand the
[41:31] two lows because they've got on leaven
[41:34] in I mean got leaven added to it
[41:40] you keep running it without leaven
[41:42] without it eleven are you okay with all
[41:44] that once here you throw in one well I
[41:48] I'm honest I just think it's here me
[41:50] this world eleven is that we are that
[41:53] part
[41:54] it's our ideas no leaven better unsaid
[41:56] among you brings the fullness of the
[41:58] Godhead bodily well right no let
[42:02] no doctor no ideas and things but you
[42:05] know what leaven does livings got one
[42:08] good compound to it it makes it rise
[42:17] right you know won't be skits 111
[42:27] biscuit but it ain't too good what you
[42:30] put eleven than that and then make it
[42:32] work I ain't agreeing to the point of
[42:35] saying that we need our ideas added to
[42:37] it and ho know that I want to stay with
[42:38] the other one but I just got that in the
[42:41] natural and laying aside there of
[42:43] thinking about me that God can come
[42:49] among us and take away that living and
[42:51] it would be all right okay now let's get
[42:54] to the thought now so you got it first
[42:56] one to come to maturity was the Lord
[42:58] Jesus Christ he was waved over the
[43:01] people on the day of Pentecost that
[43:03] Moore was coming not to just wave and
[43:08] how that no more was coming of the same
[43:11] thing that the chief priest was waving
[43:15] there's a whole field full coming and
[43:19] you just think about the children of
[43:21] Israel wouldn't that something they hate
[43:24] that live I mean that manna they ate to
[43:27] man until they got word it's tired of it
[43:29] and God gave them a olan things you know
[43:32] and killed a bunch of them because in
[43:34] the ways of doing about it but different
[43:35] times you know and here they enter the
[43:38] Promised Land and they look around they
[43:42] say Moses look at all this wheat or
[43:48] barley or every which one it was you
[43:50] know that you got a technical point
[43:52] between barley and wheat okay because in
[43:56] Ruth waiting in the it switched from the
[44:00] the wieder everything to the barley and
[44:04] that barley is used more into bacon
[44:08] different times okay now but listen see
[44:12] the children Israel they say well Moses
[44:14] why we do
[44:15] God speaks to Moses and said that's what
[44:18] you do since you get to high praising
[44:20] you telling about her and you have him
[44:21] together at one handful they tell him to
[44:25] pick the best place because he's gonna
[44:28] represent not no stunted growth and you
[44:32] know doing like we used to do I don't
[44:34] mean people are human you know but we
[44:36] were old country people we just raised
[44:39] cotton all right and see and raised in
[44:44] cotton you had what you call cotton
[44:45] allotments but I mean a thing to you but
[44:49] it did to us you had what's called
[44:50] cotton allotments in other words you
[44:52] were only allowed to plant so many acres
[44:56] Danny I'm sure has he'd understands it
[44:59] some of you others may have followed it
[45:01] to a little but you had Tony he old
[45:06] enough to remember but you you could
[45:09] plant that feel well then they'd come
[45:12] out one time and they'd say you you you
[45:15] got 10 10 acres you can write they come
[45:18] out sometimes say acreage is up this
[45:19] year will give you 12 acres that was
[45:22] good you know cuz that meant you got two
[45:24] more BIOS which means you've got you
[45:26] know more money
[45:28] what but the end a lot of times they
[45:30] come out and they say you got 10 acres
[45:34] you got to cut down cause you're only
[45:37] gonna allow you 8 acres so you got two
[45:41] acres now they were sensible enough to
[45:46] do it this away if he was going to do it
[45:49] with a governmental order and looked
[45:50] like he'd put the plow and plow it up
[45:52] blast something else what you could do
[45:54] you know you could have done that at
[45:59] that one
[45:59] they wouldn't argued with you but you
[46:01] know what the government was sensible
[46:03] enough and the people was tore you know
[46:05] what they're done they said okay gather
[46:11] all around this one place if it's bad
[46:16] leave it don't even try to gather it but
[46:22] they didn't care if you caught a few
[46:24] bowls you know and put over from the
[46:26] other side you understand what I'm
[46:28] saying
[46:28] they
[46:29] had their reasons for doing but they had
[46:31] to cut down the allotment all right so
[46:35] they didn't go out and they tell you say
[46:37] you've got two acres that's real bad out
[46:39] there said farmer gather what's around
[46:42] it and leave that what are you getting
[46:45] at I'm getting that's what the children
[46:46] of Israel when he told that High Priest
[46:49] he said go out among he was telling
[46:53] Maguire among the best get the best not
[46:58] getting old swiveled up wheat and stuff
[47:00] you know get the best and wave it
[47:02] because it's going to be the best and if
[47:07] you need to if it's got some swiveled up
[47:09] things they had one in here I remember I
[47:11] believe this in right in this writing
[47:13] that were you didn't gather the corners
[47:16] of you feel they were waves on might the
[47:18] other night you had the corner you
[47:21] didn't gather the corners oh that was
[47:22] left for the poor God allowed that to be
[47:27] done okay now let's move on okay
[47:30] see then the Lord Jesus Christ was the
[47:33] first fruit all right because he was the
[47:38] first one to raise showing that the rest
[47:42] was coming which would be the bride all
[47:47] right now she falls down she gets out of
[47:49] way she's doing things
[47:51] maybe that's why that live in this place
[47:53] there I don't know I don't understand
[47:55] all of that but I'm just saying down
[47:57] through the ages you see the bride going
[47:59] into the ground coming out things
[48:00] happening but you see God still on the
[48:03] scene that the whole wheel the whole
[48:06] field may not could have been gathered
[48:08] but they could still look good enough to
[48:11] eat down through seven churches they had
[48:14] enough to eat and survive as the Bride
[48:16] of Christ or but promised in the last
[48:19] days that that sheaf would be waved
[48:22] again not if you want it we got them
[48:27] here we can read it four dozen you know
[48:29] go into it's the rising of the Sun you
[48:31] got the sheath you got a maturity you
[48:34] got a people that's promised I will
[48:38] restore the years of the cankerworm pond
[48:40] worm locust caterpillar
[48:42] a promise of malachi for luke 1730 the
[48:49] day when the Son of Man and here you see
[48:54] the prophets starting out and sure he
[48:58] winds up being the firstfruits of them
[49:02] that slept not wrong now making him
[49:04] wrong
[49:04] because he we're the firstfruits we're
[49:07] all the firstfruits of riders Jesus
[49:08] Christ but yet he was special I believe
[49:12] he was waved over you and I
[49:13] I believe the prophets message let's put
[49:16] it that way because it says it in this
[49:18] writer he said the message I believe the
[49:22] message is what you're talking about not
[49:25] brother Branham it wasn't a waving of
[49:27] brother Branham it was the message that
[49:29] he brought
[49:30] uh-huh but now if you want to make it
[49:33] brother Branham just remember one thing
[49:35] if you make it this letter I ain't gonna
[49:37] argue with you about it but I'm gonna
[49:40] tell you one thing worst of ingathering
[49:46] you see your foot on that's putting
[49:48] yourself in a bad situation and don't
[49:50] know it by trying to make it some little
[49:53] doctrine little idea to work you could
[49:55] say brother Branham was this or what a
[49:57] cuz I heard it preached I've heard it
[49:59] preached brother Branham was that chief
[50:05] if you want to do it now where's the
[50:07] rest of the field you see where you've
[50:10] got in to the point of the the people
[50:12] they don't know what you way to go cuz
[50:13] now you're you're you're the one who's
[50:15] trapped i hain't trout I'm standing here
[50:17] with this as straight as can be I
[50:19] believe brother Adam was the first one
[50:21] to come to maturity right but I don't
[50:25] believe it was the one the way we talk
[50:26] about all of those things but he brought
[50:29] the Word of God he was the one of
[50:31] Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 he
[50:34] was bringing the Word of God if the
[50:36] message that he come to bring to come to
[50:42] full maturity in our day and it did then
[50:46] it meant more was to come alright so if
[50:50] it does that that gar that's what it
[50:52] meant
[50:53] now if you don't have it down you
[50:55] correct or the same as back there look
[50:57] what you got you got a back guard show
[51:00] that that's exactly what it was
[51:01] here's that chief Shawn the whole field
[51:04] was ready uh-huh
[51:08] so if brother Branham was the chief way
[51:10] wherever how you won of making just
[51:12] remember I'm trying to deal with the
[51:15] next stage that's the way I've always
[51:17] preached it and he's gonna argue with
[51:20] you about what you're saying brother
[51:21] Brandon was this frontrunner that thank
[51:23] God for the message he brought I believe
[51:28] that that's what's being waved right now
[51:29] his brother runs message by the true
[51:31] ministry in the last days to bring it
[51:33] forward but just remember that she's
[51:39] waving and get the point I said while
[51:41] ago cuz I stopped it the high priest
[51:45] went out and waved on that first
[51:46] original walking into Canaan but the
[51:49] next year you had to have your own
[51:51] priest dad to be a priest for you
[51:56] because he had to go out and take the
[51:58] wheat wave it then you could gather
[52:00] somebody had to do it somebody had to
[52:03] stand in your place so remember it's not
[52:05] just leaving one thing or one person
[52:12] I've never looked for to try to prove
[52:15] that something what that we're that we
[52:17] are to be like brother Branham we're
[52:19] supposed to have this now that no no no
[52:20] because that was not for us it's not for
[52:26] us to be that way we're not supposed to
[52:28] be all of those things everybody's
[52:30] looking at but we are supposed to be the
[52:32] children of God we are supposed to be
[52:34] the offspring of the Almighty
[52:36] we're supposed to be the the Alpha and
[52:38] Omega the beginning and the end we're
[52:40] supposed to be the sheath sheath he's
[52:44] waived over you and I to show we're
[52:46] going to come forth and I believe it I
[52:50] believe the bride is going to come forth
[52:52] in this last days that's why I preached
[52:58] it the way I did why cause Malachi 4
[53:01] luke 1730 all of those things all of
[53:04] those scriptures we've been brainwashed
[53:06] one lock under the son of man revelation
[53:09] 1 12 and 13 who is that good run said it
[53:12] was the bride heard about the pile
[53:16] feminists see back up above dire
[53:23] revelations 1 and allow time to read it
[53:26] but if you'll read it you'll see back up
[53:28] above there it's speaking of the Lord
[53:30] Jesus Christ
[53:32] alright then you go through that part of
[53:36] the standard in the midst of seven
[53:38] golden candlesticks and he picks right
[53:40] back up and go straight to the Lord
[53:44] Jesus Christ and saying I'm Alpha and
[53:46] Omega 2 beginning in save a lot of
[53:48] people have said well that was brought
[53:49] around now he's going now you can argue
[53:51] when you get on over the other two towns
[53:53] in the book of Revelation but don't use
[53:55] that first one anyway because you've
[53:58] proven your allan because that
[54:00] definitely was the Lord Jesus Christ in
[54:04] Revelations 1 but where's he at
[54:08] where's he made manifest in his bride so
[54:14] the bride is what you're looking for so
[54:16] why can't you believe that the bride
[54:18] could be the fullness of the Godhead
[54:19] bodily
[54:21] what case you believe that the bride of
[54:24] Jesus Christ could be the Son of Man
[54:27] because she's God made manifest in
[54:30] another form called his bride and see
[54:37] whatever bread around was waved over
[54:39] thank god we've got the message the
[54:41] message was waved over us now let's get
[54:45] into the message and be able to to line
[54:47] up with that and walk in the light of
[54:49] the word that's all I've tried to do is
[54:52] just give you to see one after the other
[54:54] after the other coming now to bring it
[54:56] to see and read Leviticus sometimes read
[54:59] it's a rising of the Sun right get in
[55:01] there and read it what to be waved again
[55:11] to be waved again remember the
[55:17] descriptions are talking about Jesus
[55:18] nobody said it and again be careful how
[55:22] you using
[55:22] were sometimes because you know I
[55:25] believe the Lord Jesus Christ is back
[55:28] here now today just like he was in the
[55:30] beginning well I just don't see it open
[55:33] your eyes
[55:33] you're alive ain't you right
[55:39] you're alive ain't you you're kickin
[55:42] that you you living why don't you
[55:44] believe that he's here well we just
[55:49] haven't seen what do you want to see
[55:50] what does it take I believe to see not
[55:56] see to believe that's where I've always
[55:59] had this in mind 40-something years and
[56:01] I said the way I've been preaching it
[56:02] that the son of man and taking it right
[56:05] straight over to this council to see I
[56:08] don't say the wrong one but there's a
[56:10] certain brother your while back you know
[56:13] we were talking he said yeah I said I
[56:15] remember the first sermon I heard you
[56:16] preach brother Maloney he's not here he
[56:21] was one he's passed on he said I said
[56:24] brother Maloney tell me what's the first
[56:25] message every breeze he said a whole
[56:28] corn o corn he remembered that message
[56:35] all the way down another brother did too
[56:37] because that's what I was preaching back
[56:39] there in 72 three seventies coming up I
[56:44] always loved to study than Old Testament
[56:47] and take him show it as to what was
[56:50] taking place now tops and shadows
[56:56] pointing to the bride listen
[57:08] to study the message from that point
[57:13] bride then the word is that something
[57:23] impossible it is if we keep saying it
[57:29] that away you remember the one I gave
[57:32] you the other day what brother Brennan
[57:34] said he was talking about the bride and
[57:36] he said I challenge you to believe that
[57:40] he said and you'll see a worldwide
[57:42] revival and one time they speaking of
[57:49] son of man in there and the bride to be
[57:50] the son man
[57:51] he said but we keep rejecting it did we
[57:56] keep turning it down but that's my whole
[58:01] point of ones I see if there was a
[58:03] sheath that meant the field was ready
[58:11] he's brother branham was to see the
[58:13] fields ready whatever you want to go on
[58:19] that just remember I'm gonna fall right
[58:21] behind say words to feel because you
[58:24] don't ain't no need a word about it one
[58:26] little handful ain't gonna feed no two
[58:28] and a half million people so that's
[58:30] basically about what cross I mean you
[58:35] take one hand and he gonna boy we're
[58:37] gonna have to really pray about this
[58:40] no they could turn around and look and
[58:46] they could pick where they wanted to
[58:47] live maybe maybe that's when Joshua
[58:50] started with it in a different one you
[58:52] know or dividing the land but it was a
[58:56] whole this field I love to go out west
[59:00] I'd love to travel out there and look I
[59:03] like let's see what is it huh what's
[59:07] that big ol thing to the moon son you
[59:11] know sunflower okay
[59:13] well I see tonight I don't know if
[59:16] you'll crack them for me I'll be glad to
[59:17] eat them cuz they just ain't worth it
[59:20] they there's too much trouble
[59:21] why'd you look at every deer standing
[59:23] he's just covered you worry and he does
[59:26] that but what I love to see is that
[59:29] whole feel 500 acres and you just look
[59:34] as far as you can see all the way around
[59:36] you and there's no Sun fire it's you
[59:41] know what they do you know what
[59:44] sunflowers something you can always know
[59:49] where the sun's that house that
[59:53] sunflowers gonna turn it's gonna face
[59:59] that soon and you just think you stand
[1:00:02] down to look at it and say if I had time
[1:00:04] enough to stand here and wait I could
[1:00:06] watch them turn so gradual until you
[1:00:10] never notice that this would understand
[1:00:12] one of these reason I said you couldn't
[1:00:13] stand well what if you dish that time
[1:00:15] and watch that time taller than the Sun
[1:00:22] that to me is resourcing that to me is
[1:00:27] the opening of the word one like unto
[1:00:32] the Son of man who is that brother and
[1:00:35] he citizen bride the bride where does
[1:00:45] that come from comes from that sheath
[1:00:46] wave comes from all the way back down
[1:00:49] through there's tops and shadows and the
[1:00:53] waving of the sheath if you don't get
[1:00:57] nothing out of the message get one time
[1:00:59] if you can talk about a sheaf or even
[1:01:02] think about a sheaf just remember it
[1:01:04] means there's a whole field fool
[1:01:06] somewhere and it ain't know that you've
[1:01:11] got to wheat know the guy I've got to
[1:01:13] the onions and the garlic no that ain't
[1:01:17] that it's got to be the same thing chief
[1:01:25] ways
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:29] think about it the waving of the sheaf
[1:01:32] to be waved again in the last days waved
[1:01:37] over the people the message of the hour
[1:01:39] to be waved I'm just paraphrasing right
[1:01:42] down the line from its rising the Sun
[1:01:45] she's wave showing that the maturities
[1:01:48] already there must be a coming forth of
[1:01:52] a harvest
[1:01:53] everything's getting ready but we've
[1:01:57] been 50 years brother Dale
[1:01:59] since the going of the Prophet so you
[1:02:04] had something to eat honey you had a
[1:02:09] message to feed owned it but that's
[1:02:13] where the problem with the people see
[1:02:14] they forgot the message I wanted to find
[1:02:19] out about the wheat I found out about
[1:02:23] the we defined about the sheath I find
[1:02:25] about the bride because whatever is in
[1:02:31] that sheath is representing something
[1:02:33] out to her that's coming why can't we
[1:02:36] believe that that when it's a fulfilling
[1:02:41] of the Scriptures the bride being the
[1:02:46] son of man the word alive in the age
[1:02:50] that you're living but it has to be the
[1:02:53] word coming down through all seven
[1:02:55] Church ages but it will come forth in
[1:02:59] the last part why because brother
[1:03:01] Branham was not I mentioned this the
[1:03:04] other day brother Branham was not the
[1:03:07] messenger to the lady of seal you can
[1:03:11] not run it that away brother Branham was
[1:03:16] is the messenger to the last days to
[1:03:19] take us into the change according in
[1:03:20] Leviticus 25 8 on down to verse 50 I
[1:03:25] mean verse 10 but you see that's where
[1:03:31] people can't even get to they can't even
[1:03:34] keep straight you look at the cat look
[1:03:35] at the pyramid
[1:03:40] look at it I mean you have one two three
[1:03:44] four five six seven by seven and we're
[1:03:52] still in lady of see you see these eight
[1:04:00] manifestations of God I've preached this
[1:04:03] in the finis late sixties early
[1:04:05] seventies there is eight manifestations
[1:04:08] of God but only seven church ages was
[1:04:13] seven men brother Branham was a double
[1:04:15] compound this messenger melikhaya
[1:04:16] forward looks everything they're gonna
[1:04:18] do two things one and turn the hearts of
[1:04:21] the children back the fate of our two
[1:04:22] brings a message brother Branham was
[1:04:24] compound yes he was he come down through
[1:04:27] Leo see but all he was doing in lay do
[1:04:29] still was rebuking and bringing the
[1:04:32] message of restoration
[1:04:34] then his message began to the seals
[1:04:36] opening and that makes him the eighth
[1:04:39] messenger eighth manifestations of God
[1:04:44] in seven Church ages you don't even look
[1:04:47] at appear me encounter this message in
[1:04:55] this day is to bring the church back to
[1:04:59] the original Word of God but around
[1:05:05] spent 30-something years he said
[1:05:07] preaching on the statue of a perfect man
[1:05:09] what he said the thirty something years
[1:05:12] doing that trying to get to people to
[1:05:15] see that's a perfect man was preached
[1:05:19] for to see was ever started right that's
[1:05:23] 60 to see what is 63 but you see this
[1:05:29] man in this end time had a multiple
[1:05:32] manifestation of things that was to me
[1:05:34] be made done in his time
[1:05:38] return the arts and the children back to
[1:05:40] the fathers bring the seals
[1:05:43] maybe these divinely revealed mystery
[1:05:45] truths that literally turn the harps and
[1:05:47] the children back to the faith of the
[1:05:49] fathers
[1:05:50] why can't we believe it but well well I
[1:05:59] I guess I just can't cuz Cena you're not
[1:06:01] looking at it in the right order I'm
[1:06:05] looking at the fullness of the Godhead
[1:06:06] bodily in a bride I'm not looking for
[1:06:15] the fullness of the Godhead bodily to
[1:06:17] have been in brother branham it was
[1:06:18] never meant to be now the Lord Jesus was
[1:06:22] God himself he was the son of man
[1:06:25] remember how we brought it to the
[1:06:26] brother Brennan was a son of man
[1:06:28] none of us by ourselves can be the son
[1:06:31] of man
[1:06:33] no people I don't care who they are or
[1:06:35] what they say brother Branham couldn't
[1:06:39] be it none of us can't be the son of man
[1:06:41] the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of Man
[1:06:43] but you put that the son of man the Lord
[1:06:45] Jesus cry in to the bride form and you
[1:06:47] got the firstfruits of the Book of
[1:06:49] Revelations you've got the part that has
[1:06:54] to be maturity come forth and you've got
[1:06:59] it worth it that can be a sheaf waved
[1:07:02] you just think about it and the little
[1:07:05] man walk out there I don't love to been
[1:07:07] there to hurt him but you know just
[1:07:10] people are just amazed at him saying
[1:07:12] thing he just said good morning and then
[1:07:15] just melt cheese I said that's great
[1:07:18] that was right because he was bringing
[1:07:21] forth his part he had to be but now what
[1:07:24] are we gonna be he said yeah but you
[1:07:28] can't expect us to be no I don't expect
[1:07:30] us to be like him by the way
[1:07:32] I expect us to be what we're supposed to
[1:07:35] be it's not meant for me to be like him
[1:07:38] I'm I'm not meant to be that he was that
[1:07:41] I'm just a little pastor of a church but
[1:07:47] I believe the bride of Jesus Christ no
[1:07:55] leaven among or get rid of her ideas I
[1:07:57] will be the fullness of the Godhead
[1:08:00] bodily
[1:08:04] she'll be the chief wave you know what
[1:08:07] comes from that the chief was waved
[1:08:09] showing there would be something coming
[1:08:11] it is the Bride of Christ the next we'll
[1:08:14] pick up on masterpiece and go through
[1:08:19] Luther Westland Pentecost and come to a
[1:08:23] statement that brought a running mate a
[1:08:25] tireless outstanding he said Mary was
[1:08:30] not to seed he said she represented the
[1:08:42] shuck okay we got him right now were is
[1:08:51] the seed if Mary was not to seed she
[1:09:01] represented to shuck worse the seed
[1:09:10] just remember whatever you come up with
[1:09:12] has got to be God in human flesh
[1:09:21] and you better go in and study the
[1:09:24] message in the earliest you know and see
[1:09:26] how much better running bragged on Mary
[1:09:28] as being I mean a super street as being
[1:09:32] Mary and Mary coming through in that
[1:09:37] time then all at once he lays a lump on
[1:09:41] us and he says Mary was not that seed
[1:09:46] said she was a carrier then who's the
[1:09:53] seed well he is okay
[1:09:56] now we're right back where we started
[1:09:58] he's the chief he's the wave he's all of
[1:10:02] those things
[1:10:02] he's the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:10:04] and put him in Bride well you got a
[1:10:13] field full of wheat ready to be gathered
[1:10:17] come on musician think on these things
[1:10:24] just trying to make little statements to
[1:10:26] where you'll understand to see what I've
[1:10:28] been preaching for all these years
[1:10:30] that's a bride of Jesus Christ is the
[1:10:32] son of man and then bring it right back
[1:10:34] down and put it in the Bible bring it
[1:10:36] right through the Bible and put it out
[1:10:37] in the end time that's what your prophet
[1:10:43] told and I told you something that he
[1:10:49] didn't teach Timnath if you do tell me I
[1:10:53] mean come to me your response would come
[1:10:56] to him if I'm telling you something that
[1:10:57] he didn't teach now I'm a human mistakes
[1:11:01] errors and things in speech don't worry
[1:11:04] about that we will cover that so we're
[1:11:06] all humans but so do you so you know
[1:11:09] we're all got that problem it's one of
[1:11:11] those inherited old age things with gray
[1:11:15] hair comes less mind evidently that's
[1:11:19] what happens
[1:11:22] drying up with a white hair coming pools
[1:11:25] the higher it pulls it up firmly I don't
[1:11:27] know what it does to it and and brother
[1:11:30] Kern you quit life in cousin he don't
[1:11:33] even understand
[1:11:34] so that's a lot to do with it I mean
[1:11:37] let's stand together and just think
[1:11:39] about it think on these things wave
[1:11:41] sheaf but he to be waved again but
[1:11:46] around said according to Malachi for ya
[1:11:53] know listen to one thing as I'll say it
[1:11:58] is it true that brought around I'm
[1:12:01] covering one time when he covered it
[1:12:02] like this see you've got the Old
[1:12:07] Testament Israel God came to Israel
[1:12:11] right came to his own it own received
[1:12:14] him not he went to the Samaritans which
[1:12:19] was high of Jew in hi general but he
[1:12:23] never went to the Gentiles I listen to
[1:12:29] know because this is where we could go
[1:12:30] on for hours he never went to the
[1:12:33] Gentiles right he told his disciples

[1:12:39] time and stopped by their or twice he
[1:12:44] dwelt with him little anyone it wasn't
[1:12:47] time for that it wasn't time for the
[1:12:51] Gentiles to come in see that was to be
[1:12:54] in the end time do you understand he
[1:13:00] returned back not in the church aging

[1:14:26] that's perforations and what he said was
[1:14:29] I'll polish it if he ain't got no
[1:14:32] dynamics then he says and I'll get it
[1:14:37] was probably a masterpiece but he said
[1:14:40] the dynamics is a refueling of the Holy
[1:14:43] Ghost
