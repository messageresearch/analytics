[30:37] speaker anoint the hearts to be able to
[30:39] receive father we ask it in jesus name
[30:42] amen
[30:44] amen amen isaiah chapter 61. i'll just
[30:47] read verse one
[30:50] and we'll just continue on from this
[30:51] morning
[30:58] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[31:01] because the lord hath anointed me to
[31:03] preach good tidings into the meek he has
[31:05] sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[31:08] proclaim liberty to the captives and to
[31:10] open of the prison to them that are
[31:13] bound may god at his blessing you may be
[31:15] seated this evening
[31:19] this morning we talked a little bit
[31:21] about the
[31:22] one at the well and
[31:24] you know when jesus began talking to her
[31:28] she knew what the sign of the messiah
[31:30] was
[31:31] yet when he tells her what her problem
[31:34] is
[31:35] she didn't get mad
[31:36] she didn't get upset with it she didn't
[31:39] say who told you jesus who told you what
[31:42] i was doing you know a lot of people
[31:43] today if a minister when he begins to
[31:45] preach and the holy spirit begins to
[31:47] take over and he begins to get into
[31:49] different places and maybe deal with
[31:51] issues and things that you know people
[31:53] say well who told the preacher yeah who
[31:55] told him what i was doing who who
[31:57] exposed me well i'll tell you who the
[32:00] same messiah that exposed the woman at
[32:03] the well it's still yet the same one
[32:05] today that exposes our lives
[32:08] that's what the anointing is for is to
[32:10] come and it opens up our lives till it
[32:13] becomes an open book to the father that
[32:16] he can look down in there put the thing
[32:18] in the minister's mouth hey there's
[32:20] sometimes you say things you don't know
[32:21] why you say it right right but when the
[32:24] anointing comes there's somebody there
[32:26] that's drawing on the gift of god and
[32:29] maybe they don't even realize that they
[32:32] have a need but the holy spirit knows
[32:35] what our need is
[32:37] therefore that's why a lot of things
[32:39] were said brothers says this
[32:42] he says
[32:44] and this being
[32:46] your spirit led by god
[32:48] you become a messenger of god
[32:51] or an angel right god's messenger god's
[32:55] angel is the very same word you can't
[32:57] separate it god's messenger or god's
[32:59] angel which has the greatest authority
[33:03] an angel from heaven
[33:05] or an angel at the pulpit right
[33:09] which has it he says the angel at the
[33:11] pulpit
[33:12] paul said if an angel from heaven comes
[33:15] and preaches any other gospel to you
[33:17] than which i've already preached let him
[33:20] be accursed so the anointed angel with
[33:24] the holy spirit and with the with the
[33:26] word stands next to god right right
[33:30] stands next to god amen
[33:33] so if an angel comes and he stands
[33:36] beside me this evening right here if you
[33:38] could come stand visible
[33:39] right here
[33:41] you'd probably be distracted by him yeah
[33:44] what what's he saying right what's he
[33:46] gonna say what's he gonna do right but
[33:47] if we really believe what the prophet
[33:50] said
[33:51] you would say the one that's most
[33:53] important to me tonight is not the one
[33:56] standing right here beside the minister
[33:58] but it is the one that's been bought
[34:00] with the prize the one that's received
[34:02] the holy ghost who was a sinner saved by
[34:05] grace the one that's received the horn
[34:08] of all that anointing for this service
[34:11] that's the one that's interesting to me
[34:13] he's the one that's got the word gloria
[34:15] listen no one here didn't have the word
[34:18] he's not been bought with a price he
[34:20] can't deliver tonight he he can bring
[34:22] and bring a message or whatever it is
[34:24] but brother said the most important one
[34:26] is the one behind the pool amen
[34:29] he's the one that's been anointed for
[34:31] the service
[34:34] and you're the ones that spend the night
[34:36] hey brother taught us that angels
[34:38] ushered us to our seats right right so
[34:40] there's angels lined up around the walls
[34:42] and in this middle of the night and
[34:43] sitting beside each person right amen
[34:46] but the attraction's not on the angel
[34:48] that's right
[34:50] that's not the main attraction right
[34:52] that's not why the holy spirit is come
[34:55] right he didn't come to bless angels he
[34:58] come to bless people that needed a
[35:00] blessing he come to to strengthen the
[35:02] brethren that needed strengthening in
[35:04] their bodies he come to anoint you to be
[35:07] able to hear the word of god amen
[35:11] he comes to anointed man
[35:13] the anointing to be consecrated
[35:16] to be dedicated
[35:18] and to let the word of god speak
[35:21] when jesus was leaving the scene
[35:24] he tells him he says go to an upper room
[35:27] and sit there right and wait
[35:30] jesus how long we got to wait that
[35:32] wasn't the problem that wasn't
[35:34] you know what john could have said well
[35:35] you know what peter i think we've been
[35:36] here long enough
[35:37] we've been here eight days
[35:39] sure that we've got what he's talking
[35:41] about amen
[35:42] if they were left in eight days they
[35:44] still wouldn't have been the horning
[35:45] right they still yet had the same old
[35:47] desires that instead had the same old
[35:49] trouble with the you know with
[35:51] everything going home but when they
[35:53] waited there till the holy ghost came it
[35:56] made a difference in their life amen
[35:58] because now when they leave the upper
[36:00] roof they're changed individuals they
[36:02] don't have that same desire yeah the
[36:05] flesh is still going to get in your way
[36:06] but the spirit man down on the inside is
[36:09] to bring this old man subject to the
[36:12] word
[36:13] amen
[36:16] if you read there in revelations chapter
[36:18] 1
[36:20] verse 9
[36:24] i'm john
[36:26] who i'm also your brother and companion
[36:28] in tribulation
[36:30] and in kingdom and impatient of jesus
[36:32] christ was in the isle of patmos that is
[36:34] called patmos for the word of god for
[36:36] the testimony of jesus christ and i was
[36:39] in the spirit of the lord today
[36:42] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[36:44] a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega
[36:46] the first and the last what thou seest
[36:48] write in the book send it into the seven
[36:51] churches which are in asia unto ephesus
[36:53] unto samaria on the pergamus and the
[36:56] thytaira and the sardis and the
[36:57] philadelphia and the laodicea and i
[36:59] turned to see the voice which spake with
[37:01] me and being turned i saw seven golden
[37:03] camel sticks and in the midst of the
[37:05] seven candlesticks one light and through
[37:07] the son of man glove with a garment down
[37:09] to the foot gird about the patch with a
[37:12] golden girdle and his head and his hairs
[37:14] were white like wool amen as white as
[37:17] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[37:19] fire and his feet unto fine brass as if
[37:22] they burned in a furnace in his voice as
[37:25] the sound of many waters
[37:27] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[37:30] and out of his mouth when his sharp
[37:32] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[37:34] as the sun shineth in his strip and when
[37:37] i saw him i fell at his feet as dead
[37:40] right
[37:40] and he laid his right hand upon me
[37:42] saying fear not i am the first and the
[37:45] last i am he that liveth and was dead
[37:48] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[37:52] and have the keys of hell and of death
[37:55] write these things which thou has seen
[37:57] and these things which are and these
[37:59] swings which shall be hereafter
[38:01] and the mystery of the seven stars which
[38:03] thou saws in my right hand and the seven
[38:05] golden candlesticks the seven stars are
[38:07] the seven angels to the seven churches
[38:10] and the seven candlesticks which i saw
[38:12] are the seven churches
[38:14] so now jesus has gone away
[38:19] but he promised to return again glory so
[38:22] now he comes down and the next time we
[38:25] find him here in the scripture now in
[38:27] revelation he is standing in the midst
[38:30] of his churches amen and in his head
[38:34] there was the seven stars that
[38:35] represented the you know the seven
[38:37] messengers and here they are in the
[38:39] seven church ages and now they are
[38:42] having a transferal of the special
[38:44] spirit yeah a special part that was
[38:48] before the throne of god now comes out
[38:50] to each one of them and rests upon each
[38:54] man to have a specific ministry for a
[38:57] specific time right
[38:59] so a church world's taking place because
[39:02] jesus ain't here anymore right in the
[39:04] corporal body
[39:06] but now he comes back to anoint
[39:08] messengers amen
[39:10] each day with a message right
[39:13] and in each age there's men that rose up
[39:16] against the message
[39:19] sure
[39:20] paul had people rise up against him and
[39:22] teach the resurrection was already
[39:24] exactly
[39:25] and paul goes a little further than most
[39:27] of us do paul begin to call their names
[39:29] yeah
[39:30] right
[39:33] they may come to that someday but
[39:35] we have to identify him
[39:37] so paul begins calling their names out
[39:40] this one right here and this one over
[39:42] here they're teaching their
[39:43] resurrections already past right and
[39:45] they're over throwing the faith of
[39:47] something right that's right amen
[39:49] well brothers what number does it make
[39:51] what doctrine i believe if it's a false
[39:53] doctrine it makes amendments
[39:57] amen see god called us to believe the
[39:59] pure word not part of the word or not
[40:02] our own intellectual idea the word he
[40:05] sent a revealed word in every age and
[40:08] that was the word that was going to put
[40:11] that part of the church in a rapture
[40:13] right
[40:14] and you ain't going to get by living on
[40:16] paul's day right you're going to get by
[40:18] living on luther's day and you ain't
[40:20] going to get by living on a wealthless
[40:21] day because there's a greater anointing
[40:24] that's coming this day and that's the
[40:26] message we have to preach now
[40:30] you know when paul comes he begins
[40:32] preaching
[40:33] and of course the word of god always
[40:35] comes to a prophet right
[40:37] so here he's teaching other men of god
[40:39] titus and timothy and
[40:41] you know timothy was a young man and he
[40:44] must have had people saying something
[40:45] about it because paul tells him in first
[40:47] timothy 4 and 12 let no man despise thy
[40:51] you right be thou an example of the
[40:54] believers in word in conversation and in
[40:57] charity in spirit in faith and impurity
[41:03] and you just look at the messages
[41:04] timothy brought to the church right
[41:06] right he preached the anointed word
[41:09] for his day exactly did he get rid of
[41:12] him you better believe me then did
[41:14] people make fun of him you better
[41:15] believe that but did he quit preaching
[41:17] you better believe he did right because
[41:19] there was something on the inside of him
[41:21] that drove him to preach what he
[41:24] preached amen hey paul's already made
[41:26] the stigma if somebody else come
[41:28] preaching something different let him be
[41:30] a curse and timothy is taking that word
[41:33] that paul preached right
[41:36] how did they try them in those days
[41:39] to know whether they said hey you know
[41:40] what you're not preaching what paul
[41:42] preached
[41:43] therefore you're false
[41:45] yeah right
[41:48] false exactly well
[41:50] this is what god revealed to me well
[41:51] it's not what paul said right exactly
[41:53] right you know it's like the man said
[41:56] brother said brother do you know that
[41:57] that lady right there has been married
[41:58] three or four times and well brother the
[42:01] lord give me a dream
[42:03] and you know she's the time to be with
[42:05] her and he says well the dream's not
[42:07] divine
[42:08] but it didn't come from god
[42:11] oh god didn't give you that dream
[42:14] listen god ain't gonna take you contrary
[42:16] to his word
[42:18] anything that takes you contrary to the
[42:20] word is not of god right
[42:23] so then down through the dark ages
[42:26] as times things begin to creep out you
[42:28] know the light begin to go out then
[42:30] although once god brings in luther and a
[42:33] little bit of light begins to shine and
[42:35] wesley comes on and brings a little more
[42:37] light and then but there was a promise
[42:39] that in the seventh day there were seven
[42:42] stars in his hand right not eight right
[42:46] five men
[42:48] bro there's nobody around here believes
[42:49] in eight messengers won't go overseas a
[42:51] few times
[42:52] yeah and people down there they
[42:54] sometimes they don't know what they
[42:55] believe
[42:56] they don't have everything like you do
[42:59] they just believe what some white
[43:00] brother tells them right
[43:03] they don't have all the language in
[43:04] their interpretation
[43:06] but now
[43:07] if you come in the first stage and he
[43:09] was a prophet
[43:11] and he's alpha
[43:12] yeah then the last one must be the
[43:15] prophet right because he's still the
[43:17] omega right and the alpha has become the
[43:20] omega so they had if there was a prophet
[43:23] to begin with there must be a prophet to
[43:25] end with
[43:26] so that corn of wheat that went down in
[43:28] the ground had to come forth and make a
[43:30] mature
[43:32] wheat exactly and there's going to be
[43:35] people who become mature that's right
[43:38] listen program says when i was there and
[43:39] he says i went over you know he'd seen
[43:42] the preview of the bride and he said the
[43:44] first bride that went by oh she was so
[43:46] in line with the word and her hair was
[43:49] just red and her dress was just right
[43:52] they were playing onward christian
[43:53] soldiers every one of them was marching
[43:55] right on and he said then all of a
[43:57] sudden
[43:58] he said the bride of america must come
[44:00] and grieve you right
[44:02] brother brown said i looked and i begin
[44:04] to
[44:04] weep
[44:06] thank god
[44:07] is this what we as ministers have
[44:09] produced right
[44:11] we have an anointed word
[44:13] and we produce this
[44:15] they you know the story about brothers
[44:17] they didn't have any clothes on and they
[44:19] were beating to the rock of rock beating
[44:21] to the to the tune of rock and roll
[44:23] music and they were dancing all in
[44:25] bulgarian ways you know just all vulgar
[44:28] and he says oh god surely this ain't
[44:31] what we produce and all of a sudden that
[44:33] voice spoke behind him again and he said
[44:35] now the bride must come and preview
[44:38] again amen but there was an alpha there
[44:41] had to be an omega right and you were
[44:44] the omega part of the bride because this
[44:47] is the last day when he came and he was
[44:50] the ones that he saw there in that
[44:53] preview when she was walking onward
[44:55] christian soldiers and he said there at
[44:57] the end a couple of them began getting
[45:00] out of step and he said i come through
[45:02] myself crying out get back in line
[45:06] right yeah
[45:08] and the last thing he saw he said was
[45:09] her trying
[45:11] to get back instead right
[45:13] with the gospel
[45:16] and i saw another mighty angel
[45:19] come down from heaven clothed with a
[45:21] cloud
[45:22] rainbow upon his head and his face as it
[45:25] were the sun
[45:26] and his feet as pillars of fire in verse
[45:28] seven but in the days of the voice of
[45:30] the seventh angel and he shall begin to
[45:33] sound the mystery of god should be
[45:35] finished as he declared to his servants
[45:38] the prophets now brother brown never
[45:41] he never sets right down and he says
[45:43] look at me
[45:46] he never says i'm the one
[45:49] yep we know by the signs and all the
[45:52] vindication he was the seventh angel
[45:54] right right and we know the mighty angel
[45:57] the prophet said none other could it be
[45:58] than christ right which is the anointed
[46:01] one
[46:02] and so now then brother comes along and
[46:04] why christ speak
[46:06] in 1963 and he says pardon this but it's
[46:09] just coming to me
[46:11] coming up in me i gotta say
[46:13] it was he that said that day up there
[46:17] inside of that woods you have no game
[46:19] right and he created he never said i
[46:22] created right
[46:24] he created three squirrels standing
[46:27] there before us right
[46:29] what is it just speaking the word
[46:32] saying there will be there and there and
[46:35] there was there there was it was he that
[46:38] did
[46:39] charlie rodney is down there in kentucky
[46:40] and nelly margin the rest of you it was
[46:43] he the same god
[46:45] that was back there and spoke to moses
[46:48] and said why do you cry to me speak the
[46:52] word right and he brought them into
[46:55] existence oh it's him oh my it was he
[46:58] that give division about a year ago and
[47:00] said that we would go over there in the
[47:01] seven seals and and now there will be a
[47:04] great thunder it would start off and
[47:06] they would be a shape of a pyramid
[47:10] and it'd be a look magazine
[47:12] like magazine and it packed it and it's
[47:14] hanging on the wall in there
[47:16] it was he that sat down hey man
[47:19] exactly was he
[47:21] was it a rocket amen
[47:25] it was angels
[47:26] right
[47:28] it was he that said that right
[47:31] it was he yes
[47:34] it was he that said turn it to the right
[47:36] right exactly
[47:38] and brother says that is our lord up
[47:41] there amen
[47:43] it was he that night when i was going
[47:45] down the road and seeing that great big
[47:46] mama snake about to get my brother and
[47:50] he said you've been given power to bind
[47:52] him or any of the rest of them amen
[47:55] right see it was he that said that
[47:57] morning when he woke me up in the room
[47:59] standing there in the corner said don't
[48:01] fear to do anything or to go anywhere or
[48:04] to say anything for the never failing
[48:07] presence of jesus christ is with you
[48:10] wherever you go
[48:12] listen god has no respect a person
[48:17] it was he up yonder in slovenia canyon
[48:21] i was standing there
[48:23] and a sword dropped in my hand
[48:25] and said this is the king's sword
[48:27] it was he
[48:29] it was he that said to me as i was with
[48:31] moses so i'll send you it was he that
[48:34] said to me standing there with a little
[48:36] preacher on the river 30 years ago
[48:38] standing there when that light and the
[48:40] same pillar of fire come down from
[48:42] heaven
[48:43] and stood there and said as john the
[48:44] baptist forerunned the first coming of
[48:46] christ your message shall we run the
[48:48] second coming
[48:50] amen
[48:52] paragraph 2 98 he said oh how it was he
[48:55] that said in prophecy through the
[48:56] mission it shall come to pass
[48:59] it was he see programs never pointing us
[49:02] to himself right right he said i was
[49:05] only there right exactly he just used me
[49:09] he used my voice he used my hands he
[49:12] used my lips right right
[49:15] it was he
[49:17] that said if one among you prophesies or
[49:19] see a vision that tells it and it comes
[49:21] to pass then remember it's not him
[49:24] it's me right
[49:26] i am with him
[49:28] he says oh my i could go on and on and
[49:30] on
[49:32] so we understand then that revelations
[49:35] 10 1 was sending a message
[49:38] down to an earthquake messenger by a
[49:42] transferral is taking place
[49:45] he's giving a messenger something that
[49:48] nor the messenger has ever had the
[49:51] responsibility to deliver before
[49:55] this is a message like none other all
[49:57] right this is a message that's going to
[49:59] cause the rapture right right matter of
[50:01] fact this message is the starting of the
[50:04] rally exactly
[50:08] so christ is the anointing
[50:10] and he sent it down with a horn of all
[50:13] amen to anoint the bride of christ
[50:17] with the word and influence her with his
[50:20] anointing right
[50:22] and calls that word
[50:27] because the word had to come to a
[50:28] prophet right right so he had to choose
[50:30] one that was a prophet sure
[50:33] he didn't choose me to bring the word
[50:36] you choose anybody else's brain exactly
[50:38] right he chose one to bring it
[50:42] and listen so the prophet of this day
[50:44] must anoint the people that's right
[50:48] i'll just use this yeah the two lids on
[50:51] there good yeah
[50:53] so here's the word
[50:55] the spirit
[50:57] and the word
[50:58] and he brings it down upon the people
[51:00] right and he begins to pour it upon me
[51:02] man
[51:03] listen he didn't dab it upon him right
[51:06] give me just a little bit yeah and i'll
[51:07] give you just a little bit yeah i'll
[51:09] give you a little bit of the word no
[51:15] no
[51:16] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[51:19] angel the mysteries of god should be
[51:21] finished
[51:23] not that there's gonna have to come
[51:24] somebody else in and and bring a new
[51:26] revelation no he's pouring out that horn
[51:30] of all upon the bride that was his job
[51:34] and it is our job to do repeaters of
[51:36] what he said and hunt down the bride
[51:40] with the anointed word glory exactly
[51:46] so it's more than just anointing the
[51:47] sons of levi right
[51:49] more than just anointing king david or
[51:51] not in some altar
[51:53] he's anointing sons and daughters of god
[51:56] who has been bought with a place
[51:59] he's taken people listen and the angel
[52:02] said i'll give you a sign in the hands
[52:03] and if they won't believe the sign in
[52:05] the head i'll give you another sign and
[52:07] you'll know the thoughts and the intents
[52:08] of their hearts
[52:10] and that'll catch them right let me tell
[52:12] you i don't want to just be hanging
[52:14] around here just because of the first
[52:16] poll where even because of the second
[52:18] pool that's not necessarily what we're
[52:20] feeding on glory
[52:23] all right exactly
[52:25] that was the lure
[52:27] right to catch the fish
[52:29] right
[52:31] but lord when they catch me don't let me
[52:33] nipple on it
[52:35] don't let me be one of those little
[52:36] bitty fishies that he reeled in that the
[52:38] lure was bigger than the fish
[52:40] no let me be that rainbow trout
[52:43] that great big real fish that he hooked
[52:45] on to her that's the bride
[52:48] and he said don't you take it and
[52:50] explain it like you tried to explain the
[52:52] rest of it
[52:56] because you're not feeding on the
[52:58] mind of a man right exactly
[53:02] i quoted that at home one day
[53:05] and a minister there he doesn't come
[53:07] anymore
[53:09] but he did
[53:10] and he comes up to he didn't come up to
[53:12] me come to the another brother minister
[53:14] after church he said what's mother jason
[53:16] trying to do do you unlikely brother
[53:18] branham yeah
[53:20] because i quoted a quote
[53:21] i didn't tell him it was a quote
[53:24] you obviously hadn't listened to enough
[53:25] tapes
[53:26] yeah
[53:27] all right
[53:28] and he'd been a preacher for 50 years
[53:31] so it don't matter how long you're in
[53:33] this thing right that don't save you
[53:35] right it matters who you know
[53:38] and he goes well i just quoted you know
[53:40] the quote you're not feeding on the mind
[53:41] of a man a mind of the words of a man of
[53:43] fail but you're feeding them the
[53:45] unfailing mighty word of the son of lamb
[53:47] and his words cannot for help amen but
[53:50] it's doing the way of the prophet no you
[53:51] didn't know who the prophet was
[53:56] hey
[53:57] all right
[53:58] it come to fulfill luke 17 and 30.
[54:02] he come to reveal the son of man amen
[54:05] listen any and brother in the angel
[54:08] tells brother abraham he'd say well
[54:09] brother i'm just come up with these sons
[54:10] no i didn't come up with these sermons
[54:11] they ain't the lord told him what to
[54:13] preach
[54:14] you have to believe that right and he
[54:16] says you know you tell them about this
[54:18] one and you tell them about that one and
[54:20] you tell them about the woman at the
[54:21] whale you tell them about abraham you
[54:24] tell them about nathaniel and about the
[54:26] woman at the world and you tell them
[54:28] that's the sign of the messiah and when
[54:30] they seen that sign happening amongst
[54:32] them people begin to believe
[54:35] oh yeah
[54:37] who has this man
[54:39] that's right a lot of people back when
[54:40] brother bran was here didn't know he was
[54:41] no more than just a prophet right
[54:44] well at least they recognize the word
[54:45] for their day

[54:51] remember exactly which one it was but

[55:32] part of them by god's grace that are
[55:35] alive and remain unto the coming of the
[55:38] lord and shall not taste death but i

[56:01] denominations and in every and every
[56:03] man-made thing there is and they're in

[56:16] remember the the dream roller boarders
[56:17] had he was rattling the cages and he was
[56:20] saying oh brother branham deliver us
[56:22] from this house of hell
[56:24] and brother adam was trying to find him
[56:26] and you know the the the dream and he
[56:29] was sitting there and brother madam just
[56:31] began speaking the word
[56:33] right right
[56:35] because it's the word that sets people
[56:37] free
[56:41] you think about how much
[56:42] oh well brother jason he was so annoying
[56:45] he sweated
[56:47] hey
[56:49] i think of work and i swear
[56:53] don't make me annoyed
[56:55] yeah
[56:59] but i do believe it's a loading chair
[57:03] and he told me he said take this voice
[57:05] to them
[57:07] and cry out against them right cry out
[57:10] against it come out of her my people
[57:13] be it upper takers over
[57:15] come out from those things and take this
[57:18] horn of all and part upon him and tell
[57:21] him you know what you're a different
[57:22] class of people oh yeah
[57:24] what does he tell us there in the first
[57:25] field he's sitting there and he's
[57:27] calling him church and he's calling
[57:28] church and church and church in church
[57:31] and in the first seal he stopped saying
[57:33] i'm not going to call you church
[57:37] i'm going to call you bride amen
[57:39] so that you might understand uh
[57:42] well just what are we to understand
[57:43] we're different
[57:45] right huh that's right we're not better
[57:48] than the church next door only the blood
[57:49] of jesus
[57:51] only the revelation he chose you to know
[57:53] this message that's right listen he
[57:55] didn't choose them maybe to know it yet
[57:56] but he chose you to know
[57:59] and now the responsibility lays in your
[58:01] hands
[58:02] what will you do with this jesus called
[58:05] christ amen
[58:12] and then tell them
[58:14] that they need to lay in the presence of
[58:15] the sun right
[58:17] then they need to ripen
[58:19] because there's going to be another
[58:21] sheath wave in the last day yeah all
[58:23] right all right let's just read this
[58:25] here
[58:25] and it's the rising of the sun
[58:29] the river says and to be waved again we
[58:31] realize in the last day right according
[58:33] to luke 17
[58:35] the son of day the sunday again and the
[58:38] day when the son of man will be revealed
[58:41] or waved over to people who is the son
[58:43] of man
[58:44] in the beginning was the word and the
[58:47] word was with god and the word was god
[58:50] amen and the word became flesh right
[58:54] right right
[58:55] i didn't say jesus had to
[58:57] go through any certain things to become
[58:59] god no no no all right
[59:02] see it is all the teaching that we have
[59:05] in the confirmation of the word of god
[59:07] by the word of the signs of wonders we
[59:09] see today that in the book of luke they
[59:11] will just quote it wrong and in luke 17
[59:14] and 30 and malachi 4 and a different
[59:16] scripture that we acquainted with when
[59:18] that that the word again is to be waved
[59:22] over the people
[59:24] that the dead traditions of the
[59:27] traditions of man is dead
[59:30] and the son of god is alive again with
[59:32] the baptism of the holy spirit right
[59:34] among us and giving us life amen amen
[59:39] right yes
[59:41] anything that's got life
[59:44] has got a little bit of emotion right
[59:47] right it's like brother samuel told you
[59:48] this morning just because there's
[59:50] anointing supreme control
[59:53] supreme authority and growth that don't
[59:54] do away with the emotion
[59:56] that don't go away with the moving of
[59:57] the
[59:58] spirit it's like one brother said if i
[1:00:01] go out to feed my horse or my dog
[1:00:03] and he don't move
[1:00:05] i kick him and he still don't move
[1:00:08] i bury him right
[1:00:11] cause he's dead
[1:00:13] and brother brown said if your religion
[1:00:16] hasn't got a little bit of emotion to it
[1:00:18] it's dead and it needs to be buried and
[1:00:22] you need to get a different religion

[1:00:30] lord you keep me on fire for you lord
[1:00:32] hey every one of us worship in a
[1:00:34] different way and that's not even what
[1:00:36] it's what comes from within right
[1:00:39] how are you worshipped like some people
[1:00:40] cry some people raise their hand some
[1:00:42] people shout some people dance some
[1:00:44] people throw their arms everywhere like
[1:00:46] me and you're stacked like a nut but i
[1:00:47] can't help it
[1:00:49] you can't help the way you worship
[1:00:51] i can't help the way i preach brother
[1:00:53] samuel can't help the way he preaches
[1:00:55] every man's gift is different but god
[1:00:57] has called a five-fold ministry in this
[1:01:00] hour to receive the anointed word to
[1:01:03] give it to the anointed bride
[1:01:07] to bring on an anointed people ready for
[1:01:09] a rapture
[1:01:11] yes father
[1:01:14] live
[1:01:15] christ was the first one to raise from
[1:01:18] raised from all the prophets and so
[1:01:20] forth although typed in many places he
[1:01:23] was the first fruits of those that slept
[1:01:25] in the bride
[1:01:27] coming of christ
[1:01:28] coming out of the church
[1:01:30] there will be a sheep wave again in the
[1:01:32] last day oh my
[1:01:33] waving of the sheaf what was the sheath
[1:01:36] the first one to come to mature the
[1:01:38] first one to prove it was a wheat that
[1:01:40] proved it was a sheep hallelujah i'm
[1:01:43] sure you see what i'm talking about
[1:01:46] it was waved over the people and for the
[1:01:49] first
[1:01:50] time there will come forth for the
[1:01:53] bright age
[1:01:56] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:01:58] denominationalism
[1:01:59] will be a message
[1:02:01] glory and the full maturity of the word
[1:02:05] has turned back again in its full power
[1:02:10] we're not waiting for full power to come
[1:02:12] full power is here
[1:02:14] no powers in your hands
[1:02:17] inspire the anointed people
[1:02:22] and being waved over the people by the
[1:02:24] same signs
[1:02:25] and wonders he did back there
[1:02:30] i like this one
[1:02:32] first
[1:02:33] paragraph 97 because i live
[1:02:36] you live also right speaking to his
[1:02:40] wife amen right exactly right
[1:02:44] now she's a wife
[1:02:46] and something had to happen right that's
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:50] it had to be a marriage
[1:02:52] right
[1:02:54] what a resurrection that was
[1:02:58] and what a resurrection this is
[1:03:01] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:03:03] alive in christ jesus by god's
[1:03:06] quickening power so he poured it on to
[1:03:09] them and he put listen if he poured it
[1:03:11] on to you and he put it into you then
[1:03:15] it's going to take you from point a to
[1:03:17] point z
[1:03:20] and all this stuff in between yeah right
[1:03:22] is immaterial
[1:03:24] because god had a plan
[1:03:26] you meant the plan
[1:03:28] um you might go up mountains
[1:03:32] you might hit flat stretches you might
[1:03:34] come down valleys
[1:03:36] but god knows beginning
[1:03:38] to the end
[1:03:40] and when you're in the valley god don't
[1:03:41] kick you out that's right right
[1:03:43] and when you're down god don't kick you
[1:03:45] out thank you lord oh you have been
[1:03:48] given an unction

[1:04:11] i don't understand all these things in
[1:04:12] the book of revelation well why not

[1:04:33] mystery

[1:21:43] power and control i need the anointing
[1:21:46] so much in my life god that i can cause

[1:22:31] one time they come through the prayer
[1:22:33] line

[1:22:36] and he says now get all the sin out of
[1:22:38] your life yeah
[1:22:40] somebody come through with sin
[1:22:43] and he said ask god to forgive you
[1:22:46] and he said repeat this prayer
[1:22:49] and then give them an eight
[1:22:51] second
[1:22:52] prayer
[1:22:54] eight seconds
[1:22:56] and then he prayed for him
[1:22:58] because their sin had been forgiven amen
[1:23:01] it's not about how long you pray right
[1:23:03] it's about how much you mean it when you
[1:23:05] do pray
[1:23:06] all you have to do is ask your father
[1:23:08] that's right forgive me god amen or no i
[1:23:11] didn't mean to do it
[1:23:12] i i didn't want to be influenced by
[1:23:14] something else god i i didn't want to go
[1:23:16] down that direction lord but i wanted
[1:23:18] you lord to have the preeminence in my
[1:23:21] life and lord i want to be in harmony
[1:23:23] with you i want to make sure that my
[1:23:25] life is dovetailed to this word

[1:24:12] anointed word in my door i am resting my
[1:24:15] entire life
[1:24:18] that's it upon this message right
[1:24:22] listen and if this i don't believe it is
[1:24:25] but if it were wrong
[1:24:28] i'll take my chances with it
[1:24:31] amen
[1:24:33] because to speak against the message
[1:24:35] is to speak against christ right because
[1:24:37] christ is the message all right amen
[1:24:41] in fact a lot of people get bold say a
[1:24:44] lot of crazy things in this hour
[1:24:47] bring a lot of reproach
[1:24:50] say lord
[1:24:51] take me out of here before that happens
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:54] i don't want to be a reproach i don't
[1:24:56] want to say something more that would
[1:24:58] that would bring reproach upon your word
[1:25:00] because this word is hell
[1:25:02] right listen lord and this word is to
[1:25:04] prepare people i don't even want to be a
[1:25:07] stone blocker right
[1:25:11] i want this word to be doctor

[1:25:17] glory
[1:25:18] what do you believe i believe he is the
[1:25:19] same yesterday today forever
[1:25:22] it's like the little color man said that
[1:25:24] time they said boss do you believe
[1:25:26] what's in that book he said yes sir i
[1:25:28] believe it from cover to cover
[1:25:31] and i didn't believe what's on the cover
[1:25:32] itself
[1:25:35] he couldn't read a word of it but he
[1:25:36] believed it right right
[1:25:38] that's the most important part of it we
[1:25:41] might not understand everything here but
[1:25:43] one thing about it we can say i believe
[1:25:47] it with all of my heart amen
[1:25:49] i had a brother come to me one minute
[1:25:51] said probably i don't understand this
[1:25:53] certain doctrine i said brother bill he
[1:25:55] didn't ask you to understand it
[1:25:57] he asked you to believe it right right
[1:25:59] and if you believe it he'll show it to
[1:26:02] you
[1:26:04] he said i believe
[1:26:07] you keep believing
[1:26:08] because when god gets ready to show it
[1:26:10] to you he'll reveal it to you right amen
[1:26:12] and then what you have to do is then
[1:26:14] walk in it glory walk in it as god gives
[1:26:17] you revelation you walk in right
[1:26:21] there's a lot of things eight years ago
[1:26:23] i didn't understand a lot of things i
[1:26:24] don't understand but eight years ago
[1:26:25] there was a whole bunch of things i
[1:26:26] didn't understand
[1:26:30] but as god begin to open it
[1:26:34] thank you lord right and i'll walk in it
[1:26:36] right and as he shows me more i will
[1:26:38] amen and if he shows me more tomorrow
[1:26:40] i'm going to walk in there and if he
[1:26:42] shows me more next year i'm going to
[1:26:43] walk on that right listen our most
[1:26:45] important goal is not to make some new
[1:26:47] year resolution but lord you let me get
[1:26:50] so in love with you god till you change
[1:26:53] my body this year let this be the year
[1:26:56] rapture
[1:26:57] amen amen
[1:27:00] they do your
[1:27:02] let the musicians come
[1:27:09] i feel good enough i can preach the new
[1:27:11] year
[1:27:17] when you can catch the word
[1:27:19] for your day right
[1:27:22] you're a blessed people amen right
[1:27:25] he didn't take the seals
[1:27:28] take it to the catholic church and break
[1:27:30] it open right and reveal it to him right
[1:27:34] but he did it to you
[1:27:36] all right
[1:27:37] they can see where jesus was born in a
[1:27:39] manger yeah that was great
[1:27:42] they can see where he went to calvary
[1:27:44] and he died and that was great
[1:27:46] and they could see where he resurrected
[1:27:48] on the earth morning and that was great
[1:27:52] but when he stepped forth
[1:27:54] to take the book of redemption
[1:27:56] and to release the things that were in
[1:27:59] there and to release your identity
[1:28:04] that's greater than his birth greater
[1:28:06] than his resurrection because without
[1:28:08] that ill man was lost right right john
[1:28:11] not knew he not he don't know he
[1:28:13] resurrection but he also knew if he
[1:28:15] didn't come and take that milk right
[1:28:19] there'd be no anointing for this right
[1:28:21] exactly
[1:28:22] but he came right away he was the word
[1:28:25] that went right let's stand together
[1:28:34] brother let's try 369 in the red book
[1:28:40] amen okay
[1:28:59] eternally

[1:31:55] anything
[1:32:16] anybody
[1:32:34] is
[1:32:42] oh
[1:33:09] i remember the first time i heard the
[1:33:10] prophet saying
[1:33:12] god created man
[1:33:14] did even i preached
[1:33:17] that he never stayed up there
[1:33:21] did he come down here
[1:33:23] to go through life
[1:33:26] um
[1:34:01] i don't care what you said
[1:34:30] you know what i thought about them
[1:34:32] you can even burn that piece of paper
[1:34:34] right
[1:34:36] but you know if you can get those ashes
[1:34:39] that piece of paper they burn
[1:34:41] you can take it right down and they can
[1:34:42] make you a brand new hundred dollar bill
[1:34:45] out of the money
[1:34:47] well that's what we are right just a
[1:34:49] bunch of burned up nothings
[1:34:52] garbage cans
[1:34:55] not worth burning
[1:34:58] he made
[1:35:07] five
[1:35:23] is
[1:35:51] they look like
[1:35:56] tomorrow
[1:36:30] once the children of israel went into
[1:36:32] the promised land
[1:36:50] foreign
[1:37:09] every day
