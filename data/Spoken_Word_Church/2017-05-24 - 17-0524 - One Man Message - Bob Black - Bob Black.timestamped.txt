[3:00] turning our scriptures to Luke chapter
[3:03] 10 verse 18 and then we'll read in
[3:06] Genesis chapter 2 verses 18 to 25
[3:23] let's just go to the Lord in prayer or
[3:27] Jesus we're just so grateful to be able
[3:29] to come into your presence tonight or
[3:31] Jesus is so grateful for your presence
[3:32] here and I pray God that you'll just
[3:35] open your word to us Lord and help
[3:36] something some of us to glean something
[3:38] out of what's dead tonight or guarded it
[3:41] might be a benefit or and I believe that
[3:43] I'm speaking to your bride tonight Lord
[3:44] and I pray that you'll help me to treat
[3:45] it right or Jesus to say something to be
[3:47] edifying that I'll get myself out of the
[3:49] way Lord Jesus that you can speak in it
[3:51] or digital just seal my lips to say
[3:53] anything in my own opinion or my own
[3:55] ideas or anything that my own thinking

[4:13] to come and be welcome in our midst Lord
[4:15] Jesus we pray we ask these things in the
[4:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[4:22] Luke chapter 10 verse 18 as you might
[4:32] recognize this from Sunday school I'm
[4:35] going to kind of recap a little bit of
[4:37] what was said then and with a little bit
[4:41] of help from this other scripture I read
[4:44] and you ever notice how brother Branham
[4:47] said when he was when he would preach he
[4:49] said he went and when he started out in
[4:51] his ministry he'd he'd list some
[4:52] scriptures down and because everything
[4:55] has to come out of the water he was
[4:56] preaching from what was written he was
[4:59] preaching he just wrote scriptures down
[5:01] to each scripture or just he the Spirit
[5:05] would inspire it and just pull it right
[5:07] off the page if the believer in reality
[5:10] when the scripture says and he said unto
[5:13] them I beheld Satan as lightning fall
[5:16] from heaven behold I give you power to
[5:19] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[5:21] all the power of the enemy and nothing
[5:23] shall be shall by any means hurt you
[5:27] that's a fantastic front was Emory
[5:31] notwithstanding in this or Joyce not
[5:34] that the spirits are subject unto you
[5:36] but rather rejoice because your names
[5:38] are written in heaven because we know
[5:41] that included Judas and and that's kind
[5:45] of a complicated topic about all the
[5:46] different sections and everything where
[5:47] everybody's written but really the main
[5:50] topic tonight I'm going to be talking
[5:52] about the ones that are written in the
[5:53] Lamb's Book of Life they cannot be
[5:55] renewed that you're in God's mind and
[5:57] and and are gonna stay there just from
[6:00] the beginning to the end so let's go to
[6:03] Juice's chapter two verse eighteen to
[6:05] twenty five and this is and the Lord God
[6:15] said it just may be for a topic I'm
[6:17] going to take the topic that you got
[6:19] sunday-school message I took for a topic
[6:21] written in him but tonight I want to
[6:23] just take a little a little fall a
[6:25] one-man message and the Lord God said it
[6:30] is not good that the man should be alone
[6:31] I will make him an help meet for him and
[6:37] out of the ground the Lord God formed
[6:38] every beast of the field and every fowl
[6:40] of the air and brought them under Adam
[6:42] to see what he would call it and
[6:44] whatsoever Adam called every living
[6:45] creature that was the name thereof and
[6:50] Adam gave names to all cattle into the
[6:52] fowl of the air into every beast of the
[6:54] field but for Adam there was not found
[6:56] and help meet for him and the Lord God
[6:59] caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam
[7:01] and he slipped and he took one of his
[7:03] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[7:05] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[7:07] had taken from man made he a woman and
[7:09] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[7:12] this is now bone of my bones and flesh
[7:14] of my flesh she shall be called woman
[7:18] because she was taken out of me
[7:22] therefore shall a man leave his father
[7:24] and his mother excuse me
[7:27] and it shall cleave unto his wife and
[7:30] they shall be how many one flesh and
[7:34] they were both naked the man and his
[7:36] wife and we're not ashamed you may be
[7:38] seated the Lord is blessing to the
[7:40] reading of the
[7:44] and we know we know brother branham talk
[7:48] about how that uh he kind of went
[7:50] through all the parables in the Old
[7:52] Testament and and coming up through the
[7:54] new about how God chooses one man to
[7:57] bring the message he deals with one man
[7:58] at a time one man to deliver the message
[8:01] and then one man to to receive the
[8:04] message that's you that's you
[8:05] individually because it's an individual
[8:10] basis if you the delivery is an
[8:13] individual the receiving is an
[8:14] individual the person delivering and the
[8:17] person delivering it is a conduit from
[8:20] that one man back there in Genesis 1:26
[8:23] 27 which which is where you were written
[8:27] so I just want to kind of start off with
[8:29] some of these quotes that that brother
[8:31] Branham talked about upon one man
[8:33] message I think you know in this day and
[8:35] time that that phrase a one man message
[8:37] is kind of it can get you if you if you
[8:41] don't approach it from the right from
[8:43] the right angle because you say well
[8:45] this was a one man message and therefore
[8:47] if so as some say well then the bride
[8:50] has no way know that the people have no
[8:53] opportunity to speak you can't have your
[8:55] own revelation because this one man is
[8:58] the only one that can speak now I want
[9:01] to get it something else too because you
[9:02] know here you look at it at Adam and Eve
[9:07] that that they were they were united
[9:09] that was perfect one that's there in the
[9:10] Garden of God coming down and
[9:13] fellowshipping with them in the Garden
[9:15] of Eden and brother and so they could
[9:16] fit a fellowship anytime they anytime
[9:20] they wanted they were in oneness where
[9:22] Adam and Eve and God were all in sync
[9:25] all in harmony there wasn't like any
[9:28] kind of own ideas and things going on
[9:30] until the the story of Satan you know
[9:33] serpent the serpent coming in and doing
[9:35] his thing but everything was just in one
[9:37] sink and Adam and Eve were even called
[9:39] by the same name if you kind of think
[9:42] about that imagine how that might still
[9:44] look if if God was calling Adam Adam
[9:46] come over here I want to talk to you and
[9:47] they both turned it wasn't like one
[9:50] would go
[9:50] and Adam and Eve were always together I
[9:52] believe that you know there's not like a
[9:54] quote I can pull so maybe that might be
[9:57] an argument you say but I believe that
[9:59] the Adam and Eve were always together
[10:01] always they they responded to the same
[10:04] name because they were called by the
[10:05] same name you didn't have a separate
[10:07] name until until they got disharmony
[10:10] came into into being they were called by
[10:13] the same thing because they were and
[10:14] they were in fellowship with that one
[10:16] man that one man of justice 126 27 the
[10:19] first ladies didn't bring out now look
[10:22] just kind of run through this Genesis
[10:24] chapter 2 I told you I was gonna read
[10:26] some quotes but I changed my mind let me
[10:28] just keep forcing ahead the Bible says
[10:32] that out of the ground the Lord God
[10:33] formed every beast of the field and
[10:35] every fowl of the air and brought them
[10:36] unto Adam to see what he would call them
[10:38] and he began to give them names and I
[10:39] believe that you know a name means
[10:41] something that means like the essence if
[10:43] God puts his name on you if he puts it
[10:45] in your forehead that means so that it
[10:47] means ownership it means it has it means
[10:52] that the nature of that person is
[10:54] applied to you because the name is what
[10:57] that thing is and so when Adam began to
[11:00] name these things he wasn't just
[11:01] conjuring up what just some some kind of
[11:04] opinion or something but just just to
[11:06] kind of illustrate it may be that the
[11:08] Dove would come before him and he said
[11:10] that I see that this this thing doesn't
[11:13] have a God it can't eat just whatever
[11:16] he's got to eat only this particular
[11:18] particular grain and so I'm going to
[11:21] call this a dove because that's what it
[11:23] is that's the essence of what this thing
[11:25] is and maybe the lamb would come come
[11:27] walking before and we need to say I can
[11:29] see that this thing produces wool they
[11:32] don't even have to think about it and
[11:33] it's got this real neat nature it's got
[11:36] to be led and all these things and he
[11:38] said I see what this is and so I'm going
[11:40] to call it lamb because he h éeer of the
[11:44] father was speaking through him and he
[11:46] knew what to apply was what to call that
[11:48] thing and maybe the the ox would come
[11:52] before him and he put that name on that
[11:54] because of the beasts of burden and it
[11:56] could carry in and keep you know plowing
[11:59] along or
[12:00] or whatever you know he knew what that
[12:03] thing was and so he applied a name to it
[12:06] and that's something I'm gonna get you a
[12:08] little bit later when I get into talking
[12:09] about how God puts he writes his name on
[12:14] you
[12:15] he writes that and that's applying what
[12:17] he knew about you from the before the
[12:19] foundation of the world because you you
[12:21] were written into him your names are in
[12:24] that description we were at earlier Luke
[12:26] 10:18 Luke 20 that you rejoice because
[12:30] your names are written in heaven and
[12:32] where your name's written your names are
[12:34] written into him again again you know
[12:38] you even go back to the Justice 128 126
[12:42] 127 but if you keep going on to the next
[12:44] verse just as 128 it says that God bless
[12:49] them maybe that's kind of a little
[12:51] scripture that oftentimes we just kind
[12:53] of skip all over get right into the
[12:54] multiplying and repletion earth but it
[12:56] says he blessed them and I believe that
[12:58] that blessing is the same thing that
[13:00] Paul was talking about in Ephesians 1:3
[13:02] 1:3 where he said blessed be the God and
[13:04] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[13:06] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[13:08] in heavenly places in Christ so where do
[13:12] you get your blessings he blessed that
[13:13] spirit man that one man and that's what
[13:16] I'm talking about tonight a one man
[13:18] message and he met bless that one man
[13:20] and if you're part of that one man if
[13:22] you were written in that man tonight
[13:23] then you can have access to all of those
[13:26] blessings that's the only way that you
[13:28] can have access to those blessings is to
[13:30] be part of that man if you're not part
[13:33] of that man and everything that's not
[13:34] part of that everything that's not
[13:35] eternal will cut eventually come to an
[13:37] end but that man never had a beginning
[13:39] never had no father no mother never had
[13:42] a beginning or any kind of lineage it
[13:45] was always existed and his nature is
[13:49] always the same his nature back then is
[13:51] going to be the same nature it is today
[13:53] when he was when he was expressed back
[13:55] then in Genesis 1:26 27 and then
[13:58] expressed later on as Genesis 2:7 that
[14:01] nature was exactly the same when he came
[14:03] down in flesh God can look down at him
[14:07] and see that man Jack's look just like I
[14:09] do
[14:10] that man maybe walks and dogs and does
[14:15] the same things that I do that's what
[14:17] God is molding us into into his image so
[14:20] that we react we put aside our selves we
[14:24] lay outside our own this flash and we
[14:28] begin to look and mold ourselves more
[14:30] into the image of the Father you know
[14:33] you know Paul if you read the New
[14:35] Testament you see that Christians are
[14:37] really in stages there's there's the
[14:39] newborn babies that are designed it's
[14:41] the silver for the other word and then
[14:43] there's the children that are talked
[14:44] about by everyone a doctrine but we're
[14:46] all growing up it tore the head which is
[14:49] Christ growing up to be adults and you
[14:52] know to take a body change you got to be
[14:56] an adult you got to know where you can't
[14:58] be tossed around wondering whether in a
[14:59] fog wondering which way to go which way
[15:01] to turn and everything but you got to
[15:03] know you got to have a revelation of
[15:05] where you came from or where you're
[15:07] going and what's happening right now and
[15:10] that's the simplicity of the gospel
[15:11] sometimes we think that simplicity mean
[15:13] is the same thing as a shower
[15:16] simplicity does not mean shower
[15:18] simplicity can be deep in fact you know
[15:21] you got in the ocean the deeper you go
[15:22] this little system the more simple
[15:24] against its simplicity that when you
[15:27] begin to go deep into God's Word and
[15:29] everything begins to tie together you
[15:31] say oh well that's talking about that
[15:32] and that's talking about that and it's
[15:34] simple because the deeper you go the
[15:36] simpler gifts simple is you can go out
[15:39] and look at the simplicity of the of the
[15:41] ocean evaporating and God moving
[15:43] everything up from the ocean into the
[15:45] into the clouds so it will rain and it's
[15:47] very simple and God's Word is simple
[15:50] deep doesn't mean hard deep can be
[15:52] simple I just so we talked about written
[16:04] in him so let me jump down to this just
[16:07] a next chapter in Luke chapter 10 verse
[16:10] 18 where it says he said unto them I
[16:12] beheld Satan as lightning fall from
[16:15] heaven
[16:16] Satan's fallen from heaven because
[16:17] because when these people began to get a
[16:20] grasp of what was happening and there
[16:23] things were written in heaven in the
[16:25] book of life then Satan what Satan
[16:28] became powerless and Satan is powerless
[16:30] when a real Christian gets ahold of who
[16:33] they are
[16:34] when a Christian begins to realize who
[16:36] they are and their place in their
[16:37] authority you know brother Branham said
[16:40] even that somebody that gets a hold of
[16:43] the word a minister standing behind the
[16:45] pulpit for example has more authority
[16:48] than an angel in heaven and he course
[16:50] you know the scripture that used for
[16:51] that is Paul said if an angel from
[16:54] heaven comes it preaches any other
[16:55] gospel than what I've already preached
[16:57] because he had authority was standing on
[16:59] the Word of God he knew where he stood
[17:00] because he knew what was written in
[17:02] heaven and when you when you know what's
[17:05] written in heaven and that what is
[17:07] written in heaven is now being
[17:09] manifested in earth then that makes
[17:11] Satan powerless that it says behold I
[17:16] give unto you power to dreidels tread on
[17:18] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[17:20] power of the enemy and nothing shall by
[17:23] any means hurt you not withstanding and
[17:26] this rejoice not that the spirits are
[17:28] subject unto you but rather rejoice
[17:31] because your names are written in heaven
[17:36] you know they're kind of that prefigure
[17:39] of a sanctifying condition where they
[17:41] they hadn't even come to to the new
[17:44] birth experience yet God had not coming
[17:47] and dwelt himself and the power of
[17:49] making them sons of God images to him
[17:52] but yet even in that sanctified
[17:54] condition they were able to cast out
[17:56] Devils and have authority over the devil
[17:59] because they were getting an idea they
[18:01] were getting a revelation they were
[18:03] operating in the authority under what
[18:05] was written in God's Word see that's how
[18:07] much power the writ of Revelation is
[18:09] even without the new birth they had
[18:12] authority over the Devils to cast them
[18:14] out to preach the gospel what they
[18:17] understood at that time in Jesus name
[18:19] but yet Jesus said uh don't don't get
[18:24] you know too excited over that what you
[18:27] should really be excited over is that
[18:29] your names are written in heaven
[18:32] where were they written in where were
[18:34] they written that there's only one book
[18:36] that I know of and that's the book of
[18:38] Christ that the God this book here is
[18:40] God and let her form that came down that
[18:42] God got wrote on the page and he wrote
[18:44] on the page by the experiences of people
[18:46] that we're living out their lives that
[18:48] God was writing out their story
[18:50] according to what he knew that they
[18:52] would do from the from the foundation of
[18:54] the world and he's writing out your
[18:56] story too he's writing out your story
[18:58] the same way that he wrote out that
[19:00] Daniels story of the down in the lion's
[19:02] den and the three Hebrew children and
[19:04] they were delivered from the fire
[19:05] because he delivered you from the fire
[19:07] of sin and affliction he delivered you
[19:09] from the mouth of the line because it
[19:11] says that the Bible says that Satan is a
[19:13] roaring lion and he's delivered you from
[19:15] those things and as he does it he's
[19:17] writing out your story so that you can
[19:19] look back and you can see that these
[19:20] things that these people lived in the
[19:23] Bible now I'm tired of that I can
[19:25] identify with that I could see my own
[19:27] life being made manifest and fulfilling
[19:31] what was written in God's Word back
[19:32] there but there's a difference between
[19:36] the power that there's a deeper God
[19:39] God's unfolding himself there's a
[19:41] difference between that power just to
[19:43] cast out Devils and things and the
[19:45] deeper power that they got on the day of
[19:47] Pentecost which was power to the sons of
[19:50] God power to make manifest that to make
[19:54] manifest that man that one man message
[19:56] that was back there before the
[19:58] foundation of the world to reveal that
[20:00] in flesh so that it could be tangible so
[20:03] that they could have fellowship with God
[20:05] so that they could have fellowship with
[20:06] those other attributes that we're back
[20:08] there have fellowship with one another
[20:10] and go to church and worship and rejoice
[20:13] and the power to be sons of God is what
[20:17] I'm talking about where you could be
[20:19] molded in His image and made it like
[20:21] this sorry for you
[20:27] and let's look at that number six quote
[20:30] brother on sending God's power to
[20:31] transform he said it's an old familiar
[20:33] text that many of your pastor says use
[20:36] down for your time that's been used
[20:37] since it was written but yet one thing
[20:39] about the Word of God it never grows old
[20:41] because is God it never grows old
[20:45] through every generation now for pretty
[20:47] near about twenty eight hundred years or
[20:49] better this word of God has been read by
[20:51] man priest and so forth and never does
[20:54] it grow old I've been reading it myself
[20:55] for some 35 years and each time I read
[20:59] it I find something new that I looked
[21:00] over the first time because here's what
[21:03] I'm getting to because it is inspired it
[21:06] is God in letter form see it's the
[21:11] attributes of God speaking forth and his
[21:14] placed on paper the attributes of God
[21:18] the genes of God the things that were
[21:21] written in God that all that make up who
[21:24] God is that was part of him before the
[21:27] foundation of the world he says the
[21:29] attributes of God is placed on paper and
[21:32] it's speaking forth the attributes of
[21:35] God speaking forth and you know think
[21:37] about that scripture back in Joe where
[21:39] it says where were you and the sons of
[21:40] God shouted for joy where were you and
[21:43] those attributes were praising God
[21:45] because they saw they looked that not
[21:47] not people or anything like that but God
[21:50] the attributes of God were able to he
[21:55] could see the book of redemption being
[21:57] revealed he can see himself being
[21:59] unfolded in a three-fold mystery that
[22:02] first God would come to come God will
[22:05] make himself manifest in the flesh of
[22:06] Jesus Christ and then just like Adam and
[22:09] either the garland out of his side would
[22:11] come the bride and then they would walk
[22:13] together and they eaten and everything
[22:15] would be in perfect oneness God making
[22:17] himself in a perfect unity of faith in
[22:21] harmony with God and his attributes
[22:24] dwelling together it is written see the
[22:35] first part of that the first part of
[22:37] that threefold mystery is that
[22:39] God comes and makes himself manifest in
[22:41] Jesus Christ so when Jesus Christ came
[22:44] on the earth and was born of that
[22:47] incubator Marian and and Joseph was kind
[22:51] of you know he wasn't born of Mary and
[22:53] Joseph he was born from above and and
[22:56] and and he he began to grow up and began
[22:59] to mature and his you know his brain
[23:02] began to develop and his his flesh it
[23:04] the outside began to grow up he began to
[23:06] you know kind of come to a more
[23:08] realization of what was happening and
[23:10] things of course as he as he matured and
[23:15] as she grew he was able to identify what
[23:17] was taking place in his life with what
[23:19] was in the scripture what was already
[23:21] written about him we know there's
[23:23] hundreds and hundreds of scriptures that
[23:25] David and Isaiah and all the prophets
[23:28] talked about how he would come in to be
[23:30] born how he would his life would be and
[23:32] and he could look back and say you know
[23:35] as he stood there in the synagogue when
[23:37] when finally he was able to come to that
[23:39] place he said look it's written I this
[23:44] day the scripture is fulfilled and not
[23:47] just that moment but the whole the whole
[23:49] story of his life how the way the manner
[23:52] that he will be born to the place that
[23:54] he would be born in Bethlehem to the
[23:56] tribe that he would come out of and at
[23:58] his time in Egypt and how he would be
[24:00] preceded by a messenger and the way that
[24:03] he was speaking parables and how he
[24:05] would be betrayed and the potter's field
[24:07] and how that he would be crucified with
[24:10] criminals and hated without a cause and
[24:12] not a bone will be broken and that he
[24:14] would resurrect from the dead and was
[24:15] ascending to heaven and and and you know
[24:18] brother I've talked about that was God's
[24:19] masterpiece how he looked there and he
[24:21] saw now this person right here is in
[24:24] exactly the way I want it this is in the
[24:27] image of the father because that was the
[24:29] father and that's another thing I want
[24:31] to bring out is that when you think
[24:32] about the father and the Son and Holy
[24:34] Ghost and all those things back there
[24:35] that happened it but I'm talking about
[24:37] that lowlife went out and then from
[24:38] there that Genesis 1:26 man went out you
[24:42] you almost run in a danger of getting in
[24:45] your head that these are different
[24:46] people but it's not different people
[24:48] there's only one person there's only one
[24:51] for
[24:51] to Jesus Christ and that's why I title
[24:54] it's the one a one man message because
[24:56] it's not different if it was different
[24:58] people then they'd be all fighting with
[24:59] each other or having different
[25:02] discussions having different ways of
[25:03] thinking thinking about it that's why
[25:05] brother Brennan said it God only deals
[25:07] with one person at a time he only dealt
[25:08] with Moses at a time he dealt with John
[25:11] when he was delivering his message he
[25:12] dealt with brother Brandon when he was
[25:14] delivering the message because you you
[25:16] got to get in sync you get God just gets
[25:18] one man in sync with that one man and he
[25:21] in heaven and and download that message
[25:25] to that one man and then he can
[25:27] distribute it to all the other people
[25:28] they can pick it up I forget where I am
[25:44] so that man that was written where you
[25:47] were written in heaven before the
[25:48] foundation of the world that that
[25:50] writing you know it we we know this is
[25:55] God God and letter form but for this to
[25:58] really be any good it's got to be put
[26:01] something inside of something there's
[26:03] got to be tabernacle inside of you it
[26:05] had to be Tabernacle inside of Jesus
[26:07] Christ and it could be tabernacle inside
[26:09] of you that Genesis 1:26 man could it
[26:12] had to be Tabernacle to the side of that
[26:14] 2:7 man and that be put in somebody so
[26:16] they can walk around that's how that's
[26:19] what the gospel is the gospel is the
[26:20] letter on the page put it into the
[26:23] inside of a person in the power and the
[26:25] demonstration of the spirit so they can
[26:27] demonstrate that power the sons of God
[26:29] and show that God is able to deliver
[26:31] that God is able to say that he's able
[26:33] to take somebody from sin and the
[26:36] heartache and bring them into the devvra
[26:38] lasting joy and all the things that the
[26:41] gospel speaker speaker because the
[26:43] gospel is not just learning it's not
[26:45] just education it's not just that you
[26:47] know there's even a quote in tandem and
[26:49] a sermon influenced that I was REME work
[26:52] you know we say worry you can you can
[26:56] put the word together almost it looks
[26:58] like from just education from just being
[27:01] educated a good educated message person
[27:03] I'll say it like that
[27:05] when you said in good Church long enough
[27:06] that you can be like maybe Adam one of
[27:09] those birds came before him and he saw a
[27:11] parrot and he said I know that I'm call
[27:13] you parrot because you just repeat after
[27:14] somebody else that's the kind of
[27:16] Christian some people are all they do is
[27:18] repeat after other people but God didn't
[27:22] call us to be parents he calls us to
[27:24] know who we are by revelation that the
[27:26] Word of God would comes alive in us and
[27:28] we know who it is and who is speaking of
[27:31] because what the objective we're getting
[27:34] at is that when you know when the bribe
[27:35] begins to realize who she is and what
[27:38] she's there for then then the devil will
[27:40] be powerless right that's what we're
[27:43] talking about in Luke chapter 10 in
[27:45] Genesis chapter 2 - all these things so
[28:01] the word the word that that man that
[28:04] Justice 1:26 for seven man that man back
[28:06] there that is Christ that man is a
[28:11] person that man is a person that you can
[28:14] fellowship with that man is you know we
[28:16] think about what what is the word what
[28:18] does the word mean to you the word is
[28:19] just education the word is just
[28:21] knowledge but the word is an actual
[28:23] person that you can commune with and
[28:25] that person is somebody that could come
[28:27] down on the scene and when that person
[28:28] comes down on that see on the scene and
[28:31] you'll know when they have arrived you
[28:33] oh you won't be wondering if they when
[28:35] you get the baptism of the new birth
[28:37] experience in your life and that person
[28:39] steps inside of your heart you'll know
[28:41] when they've arrived when you're maybe I
[28:44] had a good experience recently where I
[28:46] was down in that prayer line in
[28:48] Louisiana when you that man comes up on
[28:50] the platform and stands there where a
[28:51] lot of ministers are praying you'll know
[28:53] when that person arrives you'll know
[28:59] when that person arrives in the only way
[29:00] that you can get that person into your
[29:02] soul not just anointing on your spirit
[29:04] but into your soul is by the Word of God
[29:06] that's why the Word of God is so
[29:08] important the written word that was
[29:10] written down in heaven now become
[29:12] manifest in a on the paper that you can
[29:14] read and then the only way that you
[29:17] could that person can come and step
[29:18] inside of you is for you to read this
[29:20] word or hear it and believe it that it's
[29:23] delivered to you by the fivefold
[29:25] ministry that the preaching of the word
[29:27] appreciate the preaching of the gospel
[29:28] and you catch it and say I believe that
[29:30] and hang on to it until they become like
[29:33] that parable of the play of the soul and
[29:35] forth planted planted and the only way
[29:37] you can see what's planted only like you
[29:39] you can be sure as to what it what its
[29:41] manifesting you say well how do I knew I
[29:45] got the new birth check check the
[29:47] manifestation with what's written in
[29:49] God's Word it's a comparison with what
[29:50] God got what God's Word said it is then
[29:53] you can be sure that that you could be
[29:55] confident that's how you have confident
[29:57] and God's Word because you can you
[29:58] compare it back with God's Word that
[30:00] Paul said was a mirror you can look into
[30:02] God's Word and mirror it against your
[30:03] life and see where that compares or not
[30:05] but you know there's there's really you
[30:08] know brother Graham talked about the
[30:09] evidence of the new birth but but my
[30:11] conviction is there's really two
[30:12] evidences and those two evidences are
[30:14] faith and works if you have a revelation
[30:16] on the inside it's going to produce
[30:17] works on the outside if you say if you
[30:19] have head knowledge it's going to just
[30:20] produce nothing but if you have a real
[30:22] revelation it's going to produce a life
[30:24] that compares with God's life so that's
[30:27] what he's coming back to get when God
[30:29] comes back at to rapture his bride and
[30:31] you know let's not get technical now
[30:33] he's coming now he's coming is in
[30:36] progress the wrestlers in progress but
[30:38] when when we go to meet him in the air
[30:40] he's coming back to look not just for
[30:43] somebody with head knowledge not for
[30:45] somebody with just a lot of nerd
[30:46] learning but he's coming back to look
[30:48] for that matching piece somebody who he
[30:50] knows really knows not just because
[30:54] somebody told him but they know and it
[30:56] matches together because their life they
[30:58] manifesting on the outside they have
[31:00] power in their life and their in their
[31:03] in their private times and things when
[31:05] when things go wrong and somebody needs
[31:07] prayer and somebody needs deliverance
[31:08] you can lay hands on one another and the
[31:10] power of God flows from one to the other
[31:12] and and God is making manifest himself
[31:16] and his people in that little group of
[31:18] people that is haunting down the house
[31:20] it's getting down to it to where
[31:23] you know like God like God said will I
[31:26] find faith when I return the Word of God
[31:32] is a person the person of Jesus Christ
[31:35] coming and welling inside of you so he
[31:37] went when Jesus came and dwell on the
[31:39] earth he could look back and have
[31:41] confidence and who he was by looking at
[31:44] the written word and comparing that with
[31:46] who is with with his life and in just
[31:49] the same way that you can have
[31:50] confidence in who you are by comparing
[31:52] it with the word you know all the things
[31:54] that brother branded Jesus went through
[31:56] kind of kind of parallels the the way
[31:58] that a Christians life works - he went
[32:00] through all the little kind of
[32:02] milestones of a Christian he was born by
[32:05] the word and it really the only
[32:06] different to get technical there's more
[32:09] differences than just this but there are
[32:11] the major differences that he was an
[32:13] angel the angel Gabriel came to Marian
[32:16] and spoke to her that you're going to
[32:18] have a child and then the difference
[32:20] between that and the way you were born
[32:22] is that you heard from an earthly angel
[32:24] you know these days everybody saying
[32:27] well I don't need to hear from an
[32:28] earthly angel I don't need to hear the
[32:30] gospel the gospel can't be preached from
[32:32] an earth Brian earthly angels because
[32:34] there's only a one man message but but
[32:36] you're not going to you got to hear it
[32:39] from another angel how can you go into
[32:43] the foreign lands where they can't even
[32:44] understand English and there's got to be
[32:46] somebody to take it to them and you know
[32:49] you sit in churches so long and you've
[32:52] got the fees for promised I was reading
[32:56] a quote or brother branham was talking
[32:57] about he said people are rising up
[32:59] businessmen are rising up to say that
[33:01] the ephesians 4:11 promise has failed i
[33:06] want to ask you that question tonight as
[33:08] that failed for you yes without without
[33:12] that visions for in romans 10 and i how
[33:15] could you I can even hear the gospel
[33:17] what I preach I can you call on the Lord
[33:19] how can you I would you to know which
[33:20] way to turn without a preacher but you
[33:23] know there was what's kind of got
[33:24] people's minds all boggled up is that
[33:26] there are true and there are false
[33:28] there's a true new birth and there's a
[33:30] false there's a counterfeit and there's
[33:32] a genuine
[33:33] and there's a counterfeit birth and
[33:35] there's a genuine birth and bren-bren
[33:37] said their way that you know what the
[33:39] real thing is you can you can look at
[33:41] the counterfeit if you've got like a
[33:42] fake dollar bill then that prove that
[33:45] somewhere out there there's got to be a
[33:47] real and the same thing about the the
[33:50] gospel if there's somebody's faking the
[33:52] gospel they're just calling for money
[33:53] and everything there's got to be a real
[33:55] genuine out there that somebody's not
[33:57] interested in popularity or money or
[33:59] women and all those all those things
[34:02] that ministers fall through there's got
[34:03] to be a genuine minister there's got to
[34:05] be a genuine new birth because it's
[34:07] being faked that there's a new birth day
[34:10] that's real and true that whether person
[34:12] of Jesus Christ himself comes the steps
[34:14] on you and testifies to what's really in
[34:16] God's Word so you're born by the word in
[34:21] the same way that Jesus was born by the
[34:22] word although he he was the fullness and
[34:24] you're you're part of the ocean you have
[34:26] access to part of that attribute but
[34:28] there's no different there's no
[34:29] difference it's not a different person
[34:31] if you have access to part of that's not
[34:33] a different person the same person of
[34:35] Jesus Christ your dwelling and you and
[34:37] measure the number was dwelling in to
[34:39] him and fullness it's one person that's
[34:43] the revelation of the God here there's
[34:45] not three different people there's just
[34:47] one person and down there at the River
[34:52] Jordan when they're known in chemo only
[34:54] him kind of typing your birth he said he
[34:57] told John we got to fulfill all
[34:58] righteousness we got to fulfill
[34:59] everything that's right you know that
[35:01] was even the reason why David was
[35:03] selected to be king over the books of
[35:04] Isis talks about him because his desire
[35:06] will see to see all the Word of God
[35:09] fulfilled and then he after after he the
[35:14] anointing fell on him at the River
[35:16] Jordan and he went into the wilderness
[35:17] for forty days and forty nine days to be
[35:19] tempted and he combatted the devil just
[35:22] the same way that you come back the
[35:24] devil and your daily walk by speaking
[35:26] the word by the word there's no other
[35:28] way to fight the devil than by the word
[35:29] you can fight him with your own ideas
[35:32] and try to have a little mind battles
[35:33] with him but you lose that battle every
[35:35] time when you take God at His Word and
[35:37] challenge and take the take take that to
[35:39] the devil that will defeat the devil
[35:40] because when you know that's the
[35:43] scripture we read earlier when you know
[35:45] your position in Christ
[35:46] that gives you authority because the
[35:48] whole Word of God is backing you up like
[35:52] like if I'm if I'm standing up here
[35:53] preaching my own ideas and everything
[35:55] then I have no back up but if I'm
[35:56] preaching whatever what comes out of the
[35:58] pages of this Bible then I got all
[36:00] heaven backing me up but who can
[36:03] challenge somebody that's got all ahead
[36:05] I'm backing them up and then the Bible
[36:07] talks about Hebrews 5:8 that he learned
[36:09] obedience to the word and he grew in
[36:11] grace Luke 2:40 and then he was accepted
[36:13] on Mouse Transfiguration and the Bible
[36:16] talks about all the all these other
[36:19] stories of things that happen to
[36:21] different people in the Bible but if you
[36:23] want to see if you want to have
[36:24] confidence in who you are you've got to
[36:26] see who you are in him because he is the
[36:30] focus of the whole thing it's one a one
[36:33] man message it's not a one man message
[36:36] with a lot of hangers off or anything
[36:37] but it's a one man message where within
[36:40] him or many members a mini membered body
[36:43] back there in Genesis 1:26 27 is being
[36:46] fulfilled now in flesh in full
[36:49] manifestation where you can look at each
[36:50] other because it's Psalm 139 verses 15
[36:54] and 16 that says my substance was not
[36:56] hid from me when I was made a secret and
[36:59] curiously wrought in the lowest parts of
[37:00] the earth that I did see my substance
[37:02] yet being unperfect and in thy book all
[37:05] my members were written which in
[37:08] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[37:10] there was none of them think about that
[37:12] that God knew back there before the
[37:14] foundation of the world who would love
[37:16] him and it was not and who would who
[37:18] would do this who would struggle to
[37:19] become a Christian and who who were just
[37:21] you know some people brother I'm talked
[37:23] about some people could just reach out
[37:24] and grab it by faith and they just hate
[37:26] just it looks like things just come
[37:28] naturally this is a great faith just
[37:31] reach out and grab it but others it
[37:32] seems like they struggle a bit more but
[37:34] God knew all those things there's
[37:36] nothing new to God there's no new
[37:37] thought and he knew the end from the
[37:39] beginning and he knew what your
[37:41] situation would be tonight and he knows
[37:43] what the remedy is and if you know that
[37:46] he knows and know that he's concerned
[37:48] then you be convinced and concerned
[37:50] right back convinced a concern that
[37:53] what's written in him is true and what's
[37:55] written what's written into God's Word
[37:57] is
[37:57] rekt and that he's going to lead and
[37:59] guide you to all truth and all
[38:00] righteousness because he's showing you
[38:03] what was written he's showing you when
[38:06] when he gives you the newark new birth
[38:07] he's beginning to show you what was
[38:09] written what was written was this
[38:11] threefold mystery of the unveiling that
[38:13] you're part of him and and he's part of
[38:15] you or you're part of him and and like
[38:18] the description John says uh-oh and that
[38:21] day you shall know that I'm and my
[38:23] father and you and me and I and you and
[38:25] although it's all one just like Adam and
[38:28] he walking in the garden oneness and
[38:29] unity with God in perfect harmony no
[38:33] difference everything was in sync
[38:35] because John says in chapter 14 23 26
[38:38] jesus answered and said unto him if a
[38:40] man love me he will keep my words what
[38:44] words is he keeping the words that were
[38:46] written in him before the foundation of
[38:48] the world and my father will love him
[38:54] and we will come unto Him see when you
[38:58] get the new birth it's not just the Holy
[39:00] Ghost coming into you as though as the
[39:01] third person or something like that but
[39:03] other Father Son and Holy Ghost are all
[39:05] coming and live inside of you because
[39:06] it's one person and make our abode with
[39:10] him he that loveth me not keepeth not my
[39:14] sayings sayings those things are the
[39:17] things that were written and if you have
[39:18] the teacher inside of you the one to
[39:20] fulfill what was written in heaven that
[39:22] he's going to begin to teach you the
[39:23] scripture and the word which he hear is
[39:26] not mine but the father's which sent me
[39:28] these things have I spoken unto you
[39:30] being yet present with you but the
[39:33] comforter which is the Holy Ghost who
[39:35] your father will send in my name he
[39:36] shall teach you all things and bring all
[39:39] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[39:42] have said unto you and that's the same
[39:44] thing that happened in John chapter 12
[39:47] it talks about how that when they when
[39:49] Jesus rode into Jerusalem on the donkey
[39:51] and then they began to realize they
[39:53] begin to remember that these things were
[39:56] written of him because they remembered
[39:57] all the things that had they had heard
[40:00] about and and read in the scripture and
[40:03] they remembered they they recognized
[40:06] what they saw
[40:07] that's the story of a believer you go
[40:10] along
[40:11] you know I remember when we first kind
[40:13] of be impersonal here but when we first
[40:15] started coming to church here it was
[40:16] kind of like it I didn't know what was
[40:18] going on but well your long and long you
[40:21] begin to remember you forget things
[40:23] begin to come together just like they
[40:26] did they maybe they didn't understand
[40:27] what was taking place what was happening
[40:29] but things begin to come together until
[40:31] finally it comes together into the full
[40:33] picture that brother banner talked about
[40:35] and we're not looking at a picture of a
[40:37] club of cow in a field with a sky and
[40:40] everything that was an illustration but
[40:42] what we're looking at is the picture of
[40:43] the fullness of Christ the picture of
[40:46] the stature of a perfect man and that
[40:48] man is Christ that was that this
[40:51] bringing himself down from an eternal
[40:53] state and eternal position a heavenly
[40:55] position into into an earthly to be
[40:58] manifest in your flesh I'm spraying
[41:01] everywhere I'm sorry
[41:04] like Galatians 3:16 says now to Abraham
[41:07] and his seed where the promises made he
[41:09] say it's not into seeds as of many but
[41:11] as of one and to thy seed which is
[41:14] Christ and that's that that's where you
[41:16] were written that's what I'm talking
[41:18] about that one man that one seed and the
[41:20] seed is something that can be reproduced
[41:22] that's the only way that you can
[41:23] reproduce something is to have a sea
[41:25] that is fertilized in dermot eyes they
[41:27] can reproduce and Galatians 3:29 says
[41:31] and if he be Christ's then are ye
[41:32] Abraham's seed if you be Christ's if you
[41:35] were part of him if you were written in
[41:36] him then are you Abraham's seed and
[41:39] heirs according to the promise so how do
[41:43] you see yourself in hell you look in the
[41:45] pages of God's Word and see the things
[41:48] that were spoken of the promises come
[41:50] leap off and see your life is able to is
[41:53] manifestly what was written your life is
[41:56] manifesting justification all the
[41:58] scriptures that talked about that you've
[41:59] been through that experience like
[42:01] Abraham's journey you live through all
[42:02] those things that you've you've
[42:04] experienced that you've lived it that's
[42:06] why the new birth is an experience not
[42:08] an experience like a sensation but an
[42:10] experience like a journey where you go
[42:12] from one place to the other like Abraham
[42:14] was walking along and God spoke to him
[42:16] and he turn this way and maybe he didn't
[42:18] have any sensation at that moment the as
[42:20] life's changed and when you look back to
[42:22] your life like that
[42:24] it comes through the mud and it comes up
[42:26] into the sunlight when that really maybe
[42:29] if you could think you would look back
[42:30] and say well I once was in the mud but
[42:32] now I've come through and I now I can
[42:35] see the rising of the Sun and now I can
[42:37] see the sunlight I can see the glory of
[42:39] God's creation and I said that's how it
[42:43] is you know think about Elijah and and
[42:46] and and his servant there's standing
[42:49] where Elijah by faith knew by revelation
[42:52] knew maybe not with his naturalised that
[42:54] he knew that the armies of the Lord
[42:56] where he kept around about them because
[42:58] he could look back into God's Word and
[43:00] see that that promise was there that day
[43:03] angels of God where you are encamped
[43:04] around those that believe him and he
[43:06] said god I pray that you'll open up my
[43:08] servants eyes maybe even though I
[43:10] believe there's a quote and ask me later
[43:13] and I can try to find it but himself
[43:16] maybe not even seeing but he prayed that
[43:19] God would open up his servants eyes and
[43:21] and there his eyes were open and that's
[43:24] how I believer is you go from from from
[43:27] gradually your eyes become open because
[43:29] you're beginning to see what was written
[43:31] into him Luke 24:44 49 says and he said
[43:37] unto them these are the words which I
[43:39] speaking to you while I was yet with you
[43:40] that all things must be fulfilled which
[43:42] were written in the law of Moses and in
[43:44] the prophets and in the Psalms
[43:45] concerning me then open to their
[43:48] understanding today might understand the
[43:50] scriptures and said unto them thus it is
[43:52] written and thus it but who Christ to
[43:54] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[43:56] third day and that repentance and
[43:58] remission of sins should be preached in
[44:00] his name among all nations beginning at
[44:02] Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these
[44:05] things you can be a witness to if you
[44:09] see God's Word being made manifest in
[44:11] your midst just in your life just like
[44:13] they saw it being manifest there and the
[44:19] Bible says in Galatians 4:6 7 this is
[44:22] that that really strange scripture that
[44:25] I read in in in Sunday school because ye
[44:28] are sons God has sent forth the spirit
[44:31] of his son into your hearts crying I by
[44:34] father but cause you our sons we know
[44:37] that the new birth
[44:37] make places your sons they put God
[44:40] inside of you he puts his life inside
[44:42] you were before you are not connected
[44:44] back to the eternal before you were
[44:46] walking in sin and shame but it says
[44:48] because you are sons how are you sons
[44:51] already how are you sons even before
[44:53] that life steps inside of you it's
[44:55] because he knew before the foundation of
[44:58] the world that you would accept it and
[45:00] he knew he says he has never has a
[45:02] thought he elected you by foreknowledge
[45:04] in his mind back then you were written
[45:07] that was a writing that can't be erased
[45:09] as a righty that he can't brother
[45:11] Brennan said in the Smyrna in church age
[45:12] he says there it is Jesus came forth
[45:15] died upon the cross and accomplished
[45:17] redemption restoring to original owner
[45:19] by means of purchase or paying the price
[45:21] and thereby placed us as sons he did not
[45:24] make us sons we were already his sons
[45:27] but he placed us as sons for as long as
[45:30] we were in the world in the flesh we
[45:32] could not be recognized as his sons we
[45:35] were held captive by the devil but we
[45:37] were sons nonetheless and here they said
[45:40] 'because you are sons God has sent forth
[45:42] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[45:44] whereby you cry father father upon whom
[45:47] to the spirit fall at Pentecost sons at
[45:50] Corinth upon sons while they heard the
[45:52] word ask that's really what the message
[45:54] is about the message is to identify you
[45:57] that you are in God's thinking before
[45:59] the foundation of the world and to
[46:01] reveal that to you and to show you like
[46:03] that story a little eagle in the
[46:05] barnyard that brother branham always
[46:06] talked about that gets misinterpreted so
[46:09] often about how the little chick that
[46:10] eagle it running around said heard that
[46:13] mama cry and and he realized all of a
[46:16] sudden that he wasn't a chicken like all
[46:18] the other all the other barnyard animals
[46:20] and he began to flap his wings and reach
[46:23] up to the to the heavens because he
[46:25] realized that there was something
[46:26] calling him there was something pulling
[46:28] him like you know the scripture says
[46:30] that no man can come except the father
[46:32] draw that's what's drawing he's drawn
[46:35] you bi-election that he knew you would
[46:37] come he knew you and why he knew you
[46:38] would have that desire and when you
[46:40] heard that Eagle cry you knew you were
[46:42] an Eagle to it maybe not at first maybe
[46:45] you stroke a little bit maybe you
[46:47] struggle like a little baby with baptism
[46:48] and things that's the name of
[46:50] how can the name of God be Jesus and all
[46:52] these different things but along along
[46:54] your eyes began to be open and you could
[46:56] see you could you realize that that God
[47:00] thought of you before the foundation of
[47:01] the world that should give comfort every
[47:03] Christian that God thought of you that
[47:04] you were in the mind of God before the
[47:06] foundation that that he he placed he
[47:12] placed you in his thinking you know what
[47:16] you know what that means that that that
[47:18] you are sons that you're in his thinking
[47:21] it means that and that God has he's got
[47:24] the right to you that God owns you first
[47:27] he's got the right and get the devil
[47:29] don't have no no claim to you he's got
[47:32] you God's coming to get you and it
[47:34] doesn't matter what the devil does he's
[47:36] going to get you because it's
[47:37] predestinated it's ordained of God he's
[47:39] got to predestinated a group that he's
[47:41] coming again he's coming to claim
[47:42] because you were in his mind you were in
[47:44] his thoughts and it's thinking because
[47:46] you were part of him not you the person
[47:50] but using the the attribute attribute
[47:52] form that God thinking about you start
[47:55] preaching the when I get a little bit
[47:58] technical ever Butler said in adoption
[48:03] he said this is my son he was lost and
[48:06] now he's found he was dead he's alive
[48:07] again talking about the prodigal son
[48:09] bringing forth a fatted calf the best
[48:11] robe a ring and put it on his finger
[48:12] let's no wonder when the morning stars
[48:15] sing together and the sons of God
[48:17] shouted for joy when they seen the plan
[48:19] of salvation God putting your name on
[48:21] the book before the foundation of the
[48:23] world he puts your name on the book and
[48:26] now he's putting his name in your
[48:28] forehead he's putting his stamp on your
[48:31] life he's putting his name just like
[48:33] just like how Adam was able to identify
[48:35] back there he was able to identify the
[48:38] nature and the characteristics of each
[48:40] of those animals as they walk before him
[48:41] now he's able to identify that the
[48:44] characteristic of himself is in you and
[48:46] he's putting his name on you because
[48:48] that identifies that you are manifested
[48:51] son of God
[48:59] I'm jumping ahead of myself let's read
[49:06] in revelation 3:12 it says him that
[49:08] overcometh will i make a pillar in the
[49:10] temple of my god and he shall no more go
[49:11] out and I will write upon him the name
[49:13] of my god and here's that three-fold
[49:15] mystery again veiling I'll write upon
[49:17] him the name of my god just because what
[49:20] Jesus is doing he's revealing himself
[49:22] he's making himself known gradually
[49:24] slowly because in one case you couldn't
[49:27] be you wouldn't be able to take it all
[49:29] at once the world wouldn't be able to
[49:31] take it all at once it would blow
[49:33] everybody's mind it was just it was like
[49:36] somebody was bringing out too much too
[49:38] much water will kill the plant and and
[49:41] so he's revealing himself slowly and it
[49:44] it's a secret thing it's a secret that
[49:46] that almost can't be fully expressed
[49:48] because there's a lot of that hidden
[49:50] mystery to you that you won't it's
[49:52] something personal to you and even when
[49:55] brother Branham was revealing the seals
[49:56] there were things that I almost just
[49:58] couldn't be fully expressed to the
[50:00] people and he says in Revelations 3:12
[50:03] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[50:04] and the temple of my god and he shall go
[50:06] no more out and i will write upon him
[50:09] the name of my god because what's
[50:12] written in heaven is now being written
[50:14] in you you are written epistles known
[50:16] and read of all men and he's riding upon
[50:18] you the name of my god and i tell you
[50:20] that he can't write upon you the name of
[50:22] my god unless you know it you have a
[50:24] revelation of what that name is and you
[50:26] can't have a revelation of that name
[50:28] unless you know who that person is if
[50:31] you've got a revelation of who that
[50:32] person is and understand then he's
[50:34] writing that name is writing the name of
[50:37] my god on you and then it says in the
[50:39] name of the city of my god so there's
[50:41] that Christ whether it's something with
[50:43] a bride coming out because a New
[50:45] Jerusalem is the bride news or Islam is
[50:47] the word that that dead bride coming out
[50:50] of the like like even came out of Adam
[50:53] and you know we've got a God's revealing
[50:56] himself in that threefold way that get
[50:58] God he's creating a paradise once again
[51:01] God revealing himself in the flesh of
[51:04] Jesus just like
[51:06] and revealing himself in the flesh of
[51:08] his bride and now revealing setting up a
[51:11] new lead in a place where everything is
[51:13] back in harmony again where people get a
[51:14] walk in fellowship and everything just
[51:16] set back in one Accord an eternal
[51:18] paradise which is and he says in the
[51:20] name of the city of my god which is New
[51:22] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[51:23] heaven from my god and I will write upon
[51:25] him my new name
[51:26] and you know Eve had Adams name before
[51:29] the fall she didn't have some separate
[51:31] name she was she was under that umbrella
[51:33] of his name she knew who he was he knew
[51:35] who her she was and they had a
[51:37] revelation who God was and it was all
[51:39] wrapped up all wrapped up together she
[51:41] was walking under his name and now God
[51:44] is putting his name on his people he's
[51:47] giving them the revelation of the
[51:48] mystery of who he is
[51:50] and and and billabong said and behold of
[51:54] greater than all of them is here he said
[51:55] so she goes home and she thinks talking
[51:58] about that the Queen of Sheba coming to
[52:00] Solomon she sees he thinks now I don't
[52:02] know I read some of the scrolls that
[52:04] then men give me and it looks like if
[52:06] that was God if that's the God that if
[52:08] he's representing himself this is just a
[52:11] fantastic clue
[52:13] this is number 14 but if you want to try
[52:15] to find it if that's the God then if
[52:18] he's representing himself talking about
[52:21] Solomon in the way he writes his words
[52:24] here in that man well then surely that
[52:28] must be God in the way that he writes
[52:31] his words here in that man I think about
[52:34] that kind of expression that he's taking
[52:36] the words that were written in him
[52:38] before the foundation of the world and
[52:39] expressing them in this man and brother
[52:42] are called it writing the words in that
[52:44] man so that in a way that this Queen of
[52:47] Sheba that when she came up and she knew
[52:49] that God was identified in this man
[52:51] because of the manifestation of what was
[52:54] happening that he was able to discern
[52:56] the secrets and discern the wisdom of of
[53:00] God was able to speak things to her and
[53:03] she knew that that had to be God because
[53:05] what the brother said he writes his
[53:07] words here in that man and that's what's
[53:10] happening now to the believers he's
[53:11] writing his word to into his people and
[53:15] you know he had to have a one man
[53:18] message at the end
[53:19] make a conduit so that he could open up
[53:22] all the tile all the loosens together
[53:24] tie everything back together so that you
[53:27] could have a full picture of that man
[53:29] before the foundation of the world that
[53:31] you could have a full picture of this
[53:33] person that whose name is now applied to
[53:36] you and how its applied to you because
[53:40] you can see yourself in God's Word you
[53:42] have a revelation of who Jesus is and
[53:45] who you are because you can see he said
[53:47] psalm 46 8 it says sacrifice and
[53:51] offering that is not my ears that's
[53:53] their open burnt offering and sin
[53:55] offering and still not required required
[53:57] is that i lo I come in the volume of the
[54:00] book it is written of me I delight to do
[54:03] thy will oh my god yea thy law is within
[54:06] my heart and the volume of the book it
[54:09] is written of me you know it says in
[54:12] Revelation is that the books will be
[54:13] open and will be people will be judged
[54:15] out of the books the books are the life
[54:18] of the people the things that are
[54:20] recorded in this book brother Branham
[54:22] taught us that the book the Lamb's Book
[54:24] of Life is a historical record of how
[54:26] his people are being made manifest in
[54:29] you know what the historical record is
[54:30] is that that one man a one man message
[54:33] gets the message in and preaches it out
[54:36] to the people under him and they begin
[54:38] to preach it to and you hear from this
[54:40] one and hear from that one and and sons
[54:42] of God are being born and being
[54:43] manifested spiritually in the same way
[54:46] that children come into being naturally
[54:48] that's why when Abraham at Melchizedek
[54:50] and he said Paul talked about that
[54:53] situation he said they believe I paid
[54:56] ties while in the loins of Abraham while
[54:59] he was paying tithes to Melchizedek
[55:01] because Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[55:05] he was he was in that in that lineage in
[55:09] that situation coming forth in the same
[55:12] way that Renton and Melchizedek you and
[55:14] I were written and we've got to come
[55:16] forth we're coming forth thing revealed
[55:21] everything alright
[55:26] but we're identified we're identified
[55:29] because we can see ourselves in the
[55:31] world life is identified in the
[55:33] scripture here's the example I was
[55:41] looking for
[55:51] when you can see yourself in the
[55:53] scripture and one example that I was
[55:55] using earlier was was when the angel
[55:57] Gabriel came to Mary in the Book of Luke
[56:00] chapter one it says and the six month
[56:02] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[56:04] a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[56:06] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[56:08] Joseph of the house of David and the
[56:10] Virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[56:12] came into her and said held out that are
[56:15] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[56:17] blessed art thou among women and I asked
[56:20] this question earlier how did he know
[56:22] she was highly favored of course you
[56:24] could you could see her life she's only
[56:26] sixteen years old so hadn't done that
[56:28] much in her life she lived a clean life
[56:30] obviously but this angel obviously I
[56:34] believe that had a more comprehensive
[56:36] understanding of who she was and what
[56:39] was going to happen a little bit later
[56:40] on in her life and why she was highly
[56:42] favored why she was worth so well
[56:44] thought of by God and I believe it was
[56:46] because that God she was written in God
[56:48] before the foundation of the world that
[56:49] God knew who she was and so he he had
[56:52] this predestinated plan for her and when
[56:54] the angel Gabriel began to talk to her
[56:56] her eyes were open there along it along
[56:58] and through there through the discussion
[56:59] and she began to realize that the things
[57:01] that were spoken of in scripture about
[57:03] how this how that Jesus would come to
[57:05] life and come to the earth and how that
[57:07] a virgin would conceive and that that
[57:10] may be she may be she you know thought
[57:13] about all the other circumstances and
[57:15] things that were spoken of in Scripture
[57:16] and she began to realize that the
[57:18] scripture Dow that this angel this
[57:20] heavenly messenger was speaking her was
[57:22] talking about those things that she had
[57:24] read and she was going to be the
[57:25] manifestation of what was in the
[57:28] scripture and when she saw him she was
[57:31] troubled at his saying in casting her
[57:33] mind what manner of salutation this
[57:35] should be in the angel said unto her
[57:36] fear not Mary for thou has found favor
[57:39] with God and behold thou shalt conceive
[57:41] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[57:43] shall call his name Jesus and so Mary
[57:46] could see identify herself with the
[57:48] scripture she could look into the
[57:49] scripture and see herself in them think
[57:52] about others in the scripture also like
[57:54] John that said I'm the voice of one
[57:56] crying in the wilderness because he
[57:58] could look back and see the scripture
[57:59] talking about this person that would
[58:01] come to introduce the
[58:02] a man introduced the Messiah and he
[58:05] could identify himself with that that
[58:07] person that was spoken of in Malachi 3
[58:09] in other scriptures
[58:10] how about Peter where Jesus said I'm
[58:12] going to give you the keys to the
[58:14] kingdom and Peter but Peter maybe at
[58:16] that time when they were sitting around
[58:18] the campfire having that discussion
[58:19] didn't really understand I had no idea
[58:22] what the keys would be but then out
[58:24] there on the day of Pentecost when that
[58:26] comforter when the interpreter stepped
[58:27] into em and I began to open the word and
[58:30] now he could look back and and identify
[58:32] what just what the keys were with what
[58:35] was already spoken of his scripture and
[58:37] he could say like the Prophet Joel said
[58:39] that God is pouring out his spirit upon
[58:42] all flesh he began to prophesy and speak
[58:44] of the things that were already written
[58:46] in Scripture and he could identify
[58:48] exactly the path to get back into him
[58:50] that get back into Christ repent and be
[58:52] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[58:53] Christ what about brother Branham who
[58:56] could look back in Scripture and
[58:57] identify himself in his place his
[58:59] purpose by looking at Malachi 4 in
[59:02] Revelation gen 7 Luke 2 1730 and all the
[59:05] other scriptures that testify that
[59:06] somebody's been there in the end day end
[59:08] times is going to introduce the Son of
[59:10] Man being revealed in flesh just like
[59:13] John ever introduced Jesus tearing in
[59:16] you know program kept talking about it
[59:18] I've got to I must decrease just like
[59:21] John said I'm a sea creature that he
[59:23] might increase I've got to go all the
[59:25] sea because he said in one place to both
[59:27] of us keeping here at the same time
[59:29] because he was making way for something
[59:31] to something greater and then so you can
[59:41] look back in the scripture and identify
[59:43] yourself with all the people that were
[59:44] spoken of like enid that walked with God
[59:46] and was found not that he walked up that
[59:48] pyramid of the revelation of the that's
[59:50] that second Bible the first Bible being
[59:52] written in the stars and the second
[59:54] Bible being written that pyramid and he
[59:56] walked up on the revelation of what his
[59:58] revelation of who Jesus Christ was and
[1:00:01] Jacob wrestling with angel and many
[1:00:04] times you might have wrestled with the
[1:00:05] angel of the Lord yourself and you can
[1:00:07] identify your experience with Jacob
[1:00:09] wrestling where they angel all these
[1:00:10] other scriptures Abraham and Sarah
[1:00:12] taking a body change before the promised
[1:00:14] son can come into manifestation
[1:00:16] Bekka hearing the message for malyasia
[1:00:18] being introduced to to her husband
[1:00:21] without even seeing him and you can look
[1:00:23] into the scripture and identify your
[1:00:25] path in your journey with all of these
[1:00:26] things that were already spoken of you
[1:00:28] can identify with the message with
[1:00:30] Malachi 4 because he said he would turn
[1:00:32] the hearts of the children to the
[1:00:33] father's and the father's to the
[1:00:35] children and you can see yourself
[1:00:36] placing that scripture and seeing
[1:00:38] yourself being turned back turned back
[1:00:40] to the original face of the Pentecostal
[1:00:41] father's and coming into the revelation
[1:00:44] of these things their brother enter
[1:00:46] talked about because we know who we are
[1:00:51] by the word by the written word and that
[1:00:52] compares back with that the written word
[1:00:55] is the the letter on the page of the
[1:00:57] Eternal Word and in 1965 brother Branham
[1:01:04] says and things that are to be said you
[1:01:05] are now made your setting in this church
[1:01:07] tonight because your duty is to express
[1:01:09] God to this nation and this people and
[1:01:12] this neighborhood where you associate
[1:01:14] before that in that quote he said the
[1:01:15] gene of your life spiritual life tonight
[1:01:18] wasn't God the Father before there was
[1:01:20] even a molecule see and you are nothing
[1:01:22] but the manifestation of the gene of
[1:01:24] life that was in God as a son of God
[1:01:27] that's what part of power to become sons
[1:01:30] of God is the power the power to make
[1:01:33] manifest that war that was recorded back
[1:01:35] there before the foundation of the world
[1:01:37] and then when you see yourself in the
[1:01:39] word and it gives you authority it gives
[1:01:41] you you're identified and you have
[1:01:43] confidence in who you are let me read
[1:01:48] this is another good one behold it
[1:01:49] greater than all of them is here and I
[1:01:51] know I'm reading some quotes but I'm not
[1:01:53] just filling time so bear with me just a
[1:01:55] second and behold it greater than all of
[1:01:57] them is here you said this is number 14
[1:01:59] so she goes home and she thinks now I
[1:02:02] don't know I've read some of the Scrolls
[1:02:07] of that dim oh sorry I already read down
[1:02:25] okay I'll be wrapping up shortly but so
[1:02:28] it give us a one-man message a message
[1:02:32] that only one I got dealing with one man
[1:02:35] at a time and he deals with each
[1:02:36] individual individually to receive that
[1:02:38] one man message but now God is
[1:02:40] multiplying himself he's like just like
[1:02:43] he out of out of Adam Kade came Eve the
[1:02:47] bride out of out of Christ came the
[1:02:49] bride and now now if the bride under the
[1:02:53] under her messenger has the same
[1:02:55] revelation that that one man came to the
[1:02:58] was it was born into the earth to
[1:03:00] breathe to preach to bring if we are
[1:03:03] catching the message and when we catch
[1:03:05] the message and her saying the exact
[1:03:07] same thing then it becomes not just a
[1:03:11] one man message anymore but it comes it
[1:03:13] becomes a message of the bride where the
[1:03:15] bride is beginning to speak and the
[1:03:17] bride is beginning to have a voice like
[1:03:19] John said he said I heard the voice and
[1:03:21] he turned and he saw the Son of Man
[1:03:22] walking in the candlesticks it was the
[1:03:25] voice of the bride speaking because she
[1:03:27] was saying the same thing that was
[1:03:29] written before the foundation of the
[1:03:31] world she was saying the same thing and
[1:03:35] I believe that this message has this
[1:03:38] message has everything that we need to
[1:03:41] continue on this earthly journey to be
[1:03:44] successful to have power over the devil
[1:03:46] to - to make a body change there's
[1:03:48] nothing else that we need it's all
[1:03:50] packed up into a full vitamin the full
[1:03:52] full solution that we need to have
[1:03:55] everything that we need and you know
[1:03:57] what I want one thing that really struck
[1:04:01] me is thinking like that the earthly
[1:04:02] journey is it one thing that's going to
[1:04:05] happen it is it did as the word begins
[1:04:11] to be revealed to you than just the
[1:04:14] things of this earth begin to just kind
[1:04:15] of melt away and you know it it's almost
[1:04:20] a parent of paradoxical that when you
[1:04:22] start your Christian journey you know
[1:04:24] you know what you say I'm hardly not
[1:04:27] anything and and things but then there
[1:04:30] has become a change there's got to come
[1:04:32] a change later on it has a paradox that
[1:04:34] somebody a Christian that says I'm
[1:04:36] nothing without Jesus
[1:04:38] all these things that your your
[1:04:40] conversation almost there's a comes to a
[1:04:43] place where you begin to say I and my
[1:04:47] father won and that that is when to all
[1:04:51] the people in Jesus time they begin to
[1:04:53] put him away and say you you're making
[1:04:56] yourself God you're saying something so
[1:04:58] often there's got to come there's got to
[1:05:00] come a transition where you escape the
[1:05:02] earthly humility you break away from the
[1:05:05] earthly humility and you begin to say
[1:05:07] things that that from your humility from
[1:05:10] a humility standpoint would make no
[1:05:11] sense for a believer to say for somebody
[1:05:14] that says in just that's what's going to
[1:05:17] call the shut to pull away so I'm just
[1:05:21] going to finish right there so that the
[1:05:22] new sisters can go ahead and come but
[1:05:25] God is bringing us to a place where we
[1:05:28] know who we are we know that who that
[1:05:31] man is we know that we're part of him a
[1:05:33] one man message where you see yourself
[1:05:35] by faith and can look and confess and
[1:05:39] say exactly the same thing that the
[1:05:41] messenger is say knowing that your
[1:05:47] redeemer lives and that's your part of
[1:05:51] your Redeemer believe that if you just
[1:05:57] stand to your feet I'm just going to go
[1:05:58] to the Lord in prayer if you have a need
[1:06:05] tonight just lift up your hand if you
[1:06:07] just want to draw closer to him Lord we
[1:06:13] just thank you so much for your presence
[1:06:15] tonight but for your grace to us Lord to
[1:06:17] be able to peer into the scripture and
[1:06:19] see these things that have been remained
[1:06:21] hidden all these years Lord and now
[1:06:22] they're being revealed
[1:06:23] I just thank you God for opening the
[1:06:26] eyes of our hearts Lord Jesus as the
[1:06:28] song that we sing Lord God I pray Lord
[1:06:31] Jesus since you'll just bless the
