[0:04] it's already probably thank you let's
[0:07] get together today their names pretty
[0:09] blessed to some services today more than
[0:13] internship here help us in the Sunday
[0:15] School class orders to understand what
[0:17] bit more value that we're the way missed
[0:20] their Alabama
[0:21] I'll give us that keep them safe right
[0:24] tall as they can the afflicted
[0:36] so today's lesson here is going to be
[0:40] about The Tortoise and the hare
[0:41] and no joke I'm not doing this to be
[0:44] comical y'all can laugh but I mean it's
[0:46] it's a cute little story song but it's
[0:48] got a good name on the last lesson I'm
[0:54] talking L without humility it's been
[0:56] back in probably in February a long time
[0:59] ago but this is actually a continuation
[1:01] of that so and how important it is to
[1:09] humble ourselves before God so when I
[1:13] was a little kid aunt Denise had given
[1:17] my sister I'll take your rough skin you
[1:19] don't know what that is yeah she gave me
[1:22] up mother Goose all right so growing up
[1:25] I was listen to this little stuffed
[1:26] animal it was a goose and it was robotic
[1:29] kind of creepy and it would actually is
[1:31] awesome blinking it with its feet would
[1:33] move and it would tell stories and this
[1:35] was one of the stories that it were
[1:36] telling them when I have these books I
[1:38] follow along and like members new
[1:40] clothes I think and the tortoise and the
[1:44] hare the blue red hand and all the most
[1:47] little kids stories that tell life
[1:49] lessons and this is one that's really
[1:51] stood out to me over the years because
[1:53] I've never been one to be competitive
[1:55] I've never been one to try to to do
[1:57] better than somebody else and I'm really
[1:59] not very competitive a person that
[2:01] anything typically on the highway I tend
[2:04] to hold back and let the other guy go
[2:05] but I hate people being behind me and I
[2:07] hate holding people up in any way so I'm
[2:11] not competitive but I'm a person that
[2:13] I'm slow and stay alright and that was
[2:16] the more of that story so first I want
[2:19] to review the actual children's or
[2:21] a favorite not purge the story for The
[2:24] Tortoise and the hare we'll go over all
[2:31] right this break winner so and the
[2:34] objective of today by the way just go
[2:35] get that out of the way what I want you
[2:37] all to do today is to understand the
[2:38] importance of a constant spiritual
[2:41] growth very simple very profound very
[2:45] very important all right
[2:49] I thought this little idea of a parable
[2:52] the parable of the tortoise and the hare
[2:54] a few years ago and I spent bearing on
[2:57] my heart here lately and I think I
[2:59] really ought to share it so so the story
[3:03] goes like this and I have lots of
[3:05] different pictures from different
[3:06] stories that they had on Google the
[3:09] different versions of the story so some
[3:11] are going to be more real looking some
[3:13] will be cartoon pictures just bear with
[3:14] me on the pictures okay use your
[3:16] imagination but the story goes like this
[3:19] so the tortoise and the hare were going
[3:22] to do a footrace and the first one
[3:24] across the finish line a forfeit win and
[3:26] now of course you know that a hare is
[3:29] built for speed and they're a lot faster
[3:32] and a tortoise could ever think of being
[3:34] so right off the bat you know there's no
[3:36] competition you know who's going to win
[3:38] or who should win
[3:41] so they take off home race on the race
[3:43] day they take off from the starting line
[3:45] and in route away the hair takes off and
[3:48] leaves the tortoise didn't steal nothing
[3:50] no surprises really and all the while
[3:55] through this race the tortoise has this
[3:59] I mean the hare has this sort of exalted
[4:02] sort of haughty attitude that I can't
[4:04] lose I can't fail
[4:06] I want to win there's no egg you lose
[4:08] this race meanwhile The Tortoise take
[4:10] some more humble disposition he's he
[4:12] knows he can't
[4:14] in yourself luke 18:9 this goes well
[4:20] with this story and expect this parable
[4:23] unto certain which trusted in themselves
[4:25] that they were righteous and despised
[4:27] others two men went up into the temple
[4:29] to pray the one a Pharisee and the other
[4:33] republican the Pharisee stood and prayed
[4:35] thus with himself God I think that I'm
[4:38] not as other men are extortioners unjust
[4:41] adulterers or even as this Republican I
[4:44] fast twice in the week I give tithes of
[4:46] all that I possess and the publican
[4:48] standing afar off were not lift up so
[4:50] much as his eyes under heaven but smote
[4:52] upon his breast saying God be merciful
[4:55] to me the sinner
[4:56] I tell you this man went down to his
[4:58] house justified rather than the other
[5:00] for everyone that exalted themselves to
[5:02] be abased and he that hung them homeless
[5:05] themselves to be insulted so the hair is
[5:09] represented or is representative of this
[5:12] one who trusts in his own himself and
[5:14] his own nobility his own whatever you
[5:18] want to call it now and then the
[5:21] tortoise is a more humble so now what
[5:24] happens through their actual race as the
[5:26] as the children's story goes the hare
[5:30] runs along well until he decides I can't
[5:33] lose I'm so good I'm not at the finish
[5:35] line yet but I think I'm going to sit
[5:37] down for a little while take it easy I'm
[5:39] gonna take a little break there's no way
[5:40] the tortoise will ever past me so he
[5:42] sits off to the side and then he and he
[5:45] the story I was told as a kid goes like
[5:48] this that he said in a clover patch and
[5:50] he was sitting there maybe even though
[5:51] these different clovers and things and
[5:53] he got sleeping fell asleep while he
[5:55] slept the tortoise passed him and
[5:58] finished the race so the last leg of the
[6:01] race here comes the courts the hare
[6:03] still sleeping awake and crosses the
[6:04] thin
[6:05] I went alright slow and steady wins the
[6:08] race that's the wall of the story
[6:12] it's called perseverance what the
[6:15] supernal had his first repair first
[6:20] Corinthians 9:24 know ye not that all
[6:23] day was run in a race run all but one
[6:25] receiveth the promise so run that you
[6:27] may obtain and every man that striveth
[6:29] for the mastery is Shepherd in all
[6:31] things now they do it to obtain crumpled
[6:33] crown but we an incorruptible I
[6:35] therefore so run not as uncertainly so
[6:38] far I'm not just one that beateth the
[6:40] air but I keep under my body and bring
[6:42] it into subjection lest that by any
[6:44] means when i have preached to others i
[6:46] myself should be a castaway so now here
[6:51] is the parable of the tortoise and the
[6:54] hare
[6:56] pixilated sorry about the picture all
[6:59] right so on race day first of all the
[7:03] hair is bragging he's post you know how
[7:05] people do in competitions in like
[7:08] athletes before maybe or aggressively
[7:10] names or something they'll try to
[7:12] imitate each other and they'll say well
[7:13] I'm going to bring your head off your
[7:15] neck I'm gonna throw it against the wall
[7:16] I'm gonna put you in the nose and you
[7:18] can't win all these things they're real
[7:20] intimidated for 20 toward one another
[7:23] and real boastful and bragging and
[7:25] that's how the hair was for the tortoise
[7:29] and the tortoise being the humble
[7:31] disposition he said may the best critter
[7:33] win so Philippians 4:13 I can do all
[7:38] things through Christ which
[7:40] strengtheneth me that strengthens me
[7:42] that's the tortoises attitudes he knows
[7:45] right off the bat he can't win this race
[7:48] he knows he's not equipped for it
[7:50] and he knows he can't do it without help
[7:52] so that works to his advantage
[7:57] so they take off on race day as I said
[7:59] earlier now this guy their their their
[8:02] faces show their attitude he's got this
[8:04] haughty attitude nananana booboo you
[8:06] can't catch me he's got this humble
[8:10] attitude and this sort of optimism that
[8:13] I know I can't beat you but someone can
[8:17] help me and I can win I can still win
[8:19] the strikes he never never gets
[8:21] discouraged he's always up and going and
[8:23] that's how a Christian is you never get
[8:25] discouraged I mean you'll get
[8:26] discouraged but you will never give up
[8:37] so he knows you're not good enough and
[8:40] this is nothing that I guess live under
[8:43] the next slide this is what we call the
[8:44] tempted tortoise
[8:45] so now after the hare has left the
[8:48] tortoise he's waiting to bus later
[8:50] you'll never win and now the tortoise
[8:52] maybe becomes a little bit discouraged
[8:54] and he becomes tempted now here's what
[8:55] the devil starts to tempt him he's just
[8:57] started in this race this journey of a
[8:59] Christian life so that's what this is
[9:01] representing so in his Christian life as
[9:03] we all do we stumble when we start off
[9:05] we give our heart to the Lord and then
[9:08] maybe run off the back some temptation
[9:09] will come upon us or some some of the
[9:12] trial will go through and we just fall
[9:14] flat on our face yes it's the way of any
[9:16] Christian we just get up and rush
[9:17] yourselves often we keep right on going
[9:19] but that's not can ever give up so
[9:23] here's the temptations he faces so the
[9:25] devil tells me you're not good enough
[9:26] you're too dumb to understand the great
[9:29] mysteries The Tortoise knows he is not
[9:33] adequate he knows he must rely on God
[9:36] and this is a personal confession of
[9:39] mine I've always struggled with reading
[9:41] comprehension I can read something and
[9:43] when I get done I have no idea or what
[9:45] it's about than when I started I can't
[9:47] tell you anything about even with the
[9:49] Bible I've always been that way since I
[9:50] was 15 reading the Bible and and
[9:53] especially on the Old Testament stories
[9:55] I get so hung up like who's who and
[9:56] what's what what's happening and so I've
[10:00] always thought well I'm not going to
[10:01] give up I want to keep reading it until
[10:03] I do understand that's been my mentality
[10:05] about it I'm going to keep read and read
[10:07] read same thing with listening sometime
[10:09] this week Gaby's going to be watching
[10:11] this video and she's going to amend this
[10:13] I don't listen very good well to
[10:22] compensate for that go back and hear all
[10:25] the sermons and
[10:26] my schools anywhere from two to ten
[10:28] times as many times as I have to to
[10:30] begin to understand just the storyline
[10:32] not to give out I'm not trying to cram
[10:35] it into my heart is revelation I'm
[10:36] trying to soak in the field in the woman
[10:39] my mind so that it's available for God
[10:41] to pretty mature
[10:41] I'm not giving up and I'm not going to
[10:43] stop you can throw up your hand and say
[10:45] oh I'm too dumb
[10:46] I don't listen good and I'm not going to
[10:48] understand it and I don't have the
[10:50] reading comprehension you make all kind
[10:52] of excuses but at the end of the day you
[10:54] just keep going just keep on pressing
[10:57] because I find out about God honors our
[11:00] efforts and he knows where we are
[11:03] adequate enough where would not be no
[11:04] foreign acrobatic wa sees so he honored
[11:07] our efforts
[11:13] Hebrews 12 wherefore soon we are off
[11:16] also are compassed about with so great a
[11:18] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[11:20] every weight and the sin which doth so
[11:21] easily beset us and let us run with
[11:23] patience the race that is set before us
[11:26] looking unto Jesus the author and
[11:28] finisher of our faith before the door
[11:30] that was set before him endured the
[11:32] cross despising the shame and sat down
[11:34] at the right hand but it's not about so
[11:36] let us run with patience the race that
[11:38] is set before us and always looking to
[11:40] Jesus often depends for our faith that's
[11:42] what the torch had his honor he had his
[11:44] eye on the prize the whole time the
[11:46] finish line so when I think of The
[11:51] Tortoise and the hare I think of
[11:52] disciples of Christ I think of distant
[11:54] language I guess Katsopolis would work
[11:57] for Discipline disciple is a follower or
[12:00] student of a teacher a leader or
[12:02] philosopher my brother Bannerman looked
[12:05] in all kind of dictionaries try to find
[12:06] the definition I'm looking for and this
[12:08] is the closest one that I could find
[12:11] still exactly what I have them in mind
[12:13] of discipline but training that develops
[12:15] self-control strict control to enforce
[12:17] obedience orderly conduct the valves are
[12:20] not the source found to you they're a
[12:21] little closer to what I wanted order to
[12:24] practice self-control exercise this is
[12:28] one I added in there because I think
[12:29] it's appropriate self-denial
[12:31] when you're wanting to study and pray
[12:33] and seek God there's always distractions
[12:36] we'll never find time you have to make
[12:37] time and that's where that self-denial
[12:39] comes in
[12:40] I think of northen and Mary and the
[12:42] story I didn't get around to looking it
[12:43] up but Jesus I think of Mary the student
[12:46] at the feet of Jesus and listening to
[12:48] every word he said well Martha was
[12:49] cumbered about much serving Mary wasn't
[12:52] being lazy she was just putting aside
[12:54] her chores for daily activities
[12:56] team long enough to give time to God and
[12:59] that's all she was doing and that's what
[13:01] I saw God expects of us just give some
[13:04] time to God every day the marriage of
[13:08] the Lamb Esther was to become a bride so
[13:12] she didn't want none of the authority of
[13:14] the world she wanted to go in to the
[13:16] king just like she was she adorned
[13:18] themselves like the Pentecostal women
[13:20] ought to with a mate humble spirit but
[13:23] when all these fancy first ladies come
[13:25] by with all their new funding and then
[13:27] go things the King looked at them and
[13:29] put them in the chamber with the
[13:31] concubines but when this Esther come
[13:34] into this into his sight and he got a
[13:36] glimpse of that sweet humming spirit he
[13:38] said that's her go get the crown put on
[13:41] her head
[13:42] that's it
[13:48] let them adorn themselves with a kind of
[13:50] a spirit not only the women but the men
[13:52] to adorn themselves with that kind of a
[13:54] spirit then you become a ready for the
[13:56] bride sweet Reverend Esther make her
[13:59] heart clean
[14:00] regardless of our disposition you know
[14:02] the hair was inherently proud and
[14:05] haughty and and the tortoise not so much
[14:08] but it was more of a humble side the
[14:10] verb regardless of that you know we can
[14:12] choose humility regardless I don't think
[14:15] anyone's coming over the whole dog
[14:16] humility I think most of us have a lot
[14:17] of pride to start out with and we have
[14:20] to humble ourselves and we have to admit
[14:22] we're wrong we don't know everything so
[14:29] how's the picture that turned out
[14:32] so now on to the furtherance of the rest
[14:34] of the said earlier the hair gets real
[14:36] proud gets real lifted up in himself and
[14:39] said I can't film now here's how it
[14:42] compares to Christianity to Christians
[14:44] especially in commencing deliveries I
[14:46] made up this term I don't know if I've
[14:48] ever heard it used blanket salvation
[14:51] most everybody that I've seen in
[14:53] Christianity even in the message seem
[14:55] like they believe that salvation is a
[14:57] one-time thing that maybe when you were
[14:59] 12 you gave your heart to the Lord
[15:01] you name the experience you shout it but
[15:04] with tongues at 200 bucks cruise
[15:06] club-friendly our hair stood up whatever
[15:07] and all those things are good and can
[15:10] but and I believe they're of God the
[15:12] devil can't impersonate those but I like
[15:14] to believe those things the experience
[15:15] the attire of God but there has to be
[15:19] something after that there has to be a
[15:21] continuation a good scripture about that
[15:24] later but the terror believes in this
[15:29] blanket salvation or eternal security I
[15:31] gave a hard floor bla bla bla and here's
[15:34] what's the Tinker is today is I came
[15:36] with a seed in me I what's the thing
[15:39] wrote down always was eternal and all
[15:42] these things that I've seen personally
[15:43] that people believe maybe the ministers
[15:45] that believe those things still study to
[15:46] get a sermon but it's then like the
[15:48] layout teeth sort of sit down why would
[15:50] you keep studying and seeking God if you
[15:52] think you always was eternal and if you
[15:54] don't need anything if the race is run
[15:56] this over with and you're as good as
[15:58] done you're going to sit down and you're
[16:01] going to take it easy that's the problem
[16:03] that's why they say you always say yeah
[16:05] exactly
[16:06] and people believe these things and it
[16:08] actually causes them to stumble it than
[16:10] we even know it so I always had a scene
[16:14] in me and he gets this pride attitude of
[16:16] I deserve I deserve a break I deserve to
[16:18] sit down I deserve to rest a little
[16:20] while I know this because I've seen
[16:22] pride work in people
[16:23] very close family member that I've seen
[16:26] that quick on the church way reading the
[16:28] Bible with his marriage with his dog and
[16:31] all these things went off - now his life
[16:33] is in shambles and I watched it from the
[16:36] earliest starts of pride just in the
[16:38] most subtle form of Pride and watch how
[16:40] a canker had built and developed to what
[16:43] it is today is a terrible terrible thing
[16:46] it's very obviously what we're talking
[16:48] about her phone off humility we don't
[16:50] want to have the prize both of these
[16:53] guys had inherent flaws he wasn't good
[16:55] enough to run the race but he was
[16:57] relying on God he had flaws - but that
[17:00] didn't mean he couldn't make it I didn't
[17:02] mean he couldn't run the race here's the
[17:04] problem this is the biggest problem with
[17:07] the hare simple it's really simple he
[17:12] stepped out of the way I thought it did
[17:15] he was in the way of righteousness he
[17:18] was in the way that leads to salvation
[17:20] he was on the salvation Highway if you
[17:22] will Lenny stepped aside despite all of
[17:26] his pride and his flaws and his uh his
[17:28] misconceptions its false doctrine that
[17:30] we all come with he stepped out of the
[17:34] way he could have got rid of those and
[17:35] what happened he continued in the faith
[17:37] if he had not stopped God would have
[17:39] discerned those thoughts in his heart
[17:41] and took them away from him in time they
[17:44] were washed by the water of the word of
[17:46] studying and praying and seeking God and
[17:48] here in the work being creation what
[17:49] takes those things away things that we
[17:51] didn't even know we had that need to be
[17:53] dealt with
[17:58] it's just another picture of the same
[18:00] thing so he's sitting here in this
[18:02] flower bed of ease and he maybe sit down
[18:04] at first and he started meditating on
[18:06] these things these little clovers of
[18:08] always was eternal he meditates on on
[18:11] his little false doctrines of his and
[18:13] comforts himself cuz that's what his
[18:14] salvation is based on and he finds
[18:16] comfort and consolation in that instead
[18:18] of the Word of God
[18:20] do you think that the fact that he went
[18:25] to sleep yeah exactly because he got
[18:30] distracted with all those things and
[18:32] eventually went to a spiritual sleep he
[18:34] didn't know that he was plagued with
[18:35] these problems he thought he was going
[18:38] through he thought he was gonna make it
[18:39] but he was deceived and even if you are
[18:42] deceived as long as you stay in the way
[18:43] of righteousness just keep going don't
[18:46] ever stop no part of this lesson is
[18:47] don't stop that was the that was the
[18:50] objective to understand the importance
[18:52] of constant spiritual growth he never
[18:54] thought alright so there he is he's
[18:59] fallen asleep towards passed them by
[19:01] maybe the Lord didn't even notice him
[19:03] there but he just minds all business
[19:04] running his rest now there's an
[19:09] interesting picture on how well you can
[19:10] see that but this was the tortoise looks
[19:13] to he leadeth me in the paths of
[19:14] righteousness for his name's sake and
[19:16] that's the past that the hare stepped
[19:18] out of you notice in this picture these
[19:20] Shepherds are leaving these sheep of a
[19:22] treacherous path up a mountain of a
[19:24] stature perfect man he's going to take
[19:26] them to the very top if they'll keep
[19:28] following him but if they get out of the
[19:30] way they'll tumbled and fall down this
[19:32] mountain such a treacherous way if you
[19:35] get off to the side he stopped it's
[19:36] sanctification for any reason if you
[19:39] stop and you don't keep going all the
[19:40] way at the top of the stature Burton man
[19:44] you just stop anywhere you're gonna fall
[19:46] then you just keep on going to trust
[19:48] your Shepherd
[19:49] never never stop signal
[19:59] now what just out here let us all take
[20:04] you tonight Lord for I believe that it's
[20:07] time for us to take inventory checking
[20:09] up time but we don't know what time it's
[20:12] going to be checking out time it may be
[20:14] later than we think
[20:15] so let's consider our ways tonight and
[20:18] our thoughts I want a traditional
[20:22] network y'all it may not be there
[20:24] has he never heard the word fickle not a
[20:26] real common word heard fickle it's like
[20:28] a pickle whenever with that well here's
[20:35] a new we're fueling pickle it means
[20:37] changing frequently especially as
[20:40] regards to one's loyalties and pretty
[20:42] not constant or loyal and affectionate
[20:45] my generation is the most fickle life
[20:48] I've ever known but the second
[20:50] generation that I've known but anyway
[20:52] unless I read the history books but the
[20:54] fact is I've seen guys that I work with
[20:56] they're on there
[20:57] they've had all Thrones changing spouses
[20:59] and houses and phones and all these
[21:03] things can't keep one job in one house
[21:05] and what's bouncing and one phone number
[21:07] in bah-bah-bah
[21:08] I guess the change the phone number goes
[21:09] the creditors are chasing on whatever
[21:11] but Gregg phone brother Danny sister
[21:14] Joyce your walk back there one that's
[21:15] always been an example brother sister
[21:17] bill some family members of mine that
[21:20] are great aunt uncle and aunt and uncle
[21:22] live up in Hollywood Georgia
[21:23] side-by-side there in the first house
[21:25] that they moved into and they got they
[21:28] still got the pond behind the same cars
[21:29] still that same spouses so you know the
[21:31] same kids still got all the same stuff
[21:33] they're just keep on keeping on and
[21:35] that's why I say it's better we'll leave
[21:37] that early every guy born
[21:39] I mean people change the dogs every 10
[21:41] minutes
[21:42] but to be that tourist you can't be
[21:44] fickle the hair is fickle he's easily
[21:46] swayed with every wind of false doctrine
[21:48] he's going over here things over here
[21:50] just every new move every new promotion
[21:53] and emotion and everything and a wise
[21:57] truck driver told me when we got married
[21:59] in 2007 what some of the wisest words
[22:02] were heard he said marriage is what you
[22:05] make of it instead of you in other word
[22:07] that's how he said to me but I meditate
[22:09] on that effort he said that to me I was
[22:10] really good marriage is what you make of
[22:12] it you're how so much may know that your
[22:14] life is what you might go and your job
[22:16] is what you make of it
[22:18] something will try to change their house
[22:19] and spouse and job and car and
[22:20] everything all the time trying to make
[22:22] them fit that person when maybe they
[22:25] need to change it right okay it's a
[22:28] simple one apply but it also pertains to
[22:30] what we're talking about
[22:34] [Laughter]
[22:41] did you know it is possible to not know
[22:44] what you believe it's kind of a tricky
[22:46] statement think about that did you know
[22:49] it is possible to not know what you
[22:51] believe really or that voters thought
[22:53] about them you can actually thank you
[22:56] believe and the oneness of the Godhead
[22:58] or you think you believe and you know
[23:01] all the things that we stand for a water
[23:03] baptism the name of Jesus Christ and all
[23:05] these things and you think you
[23:06] understand it and you do conceptually
[23:08] but has it been revealed it is possible
[23:10] to not know what you believe there's a
[23:14] cure for that there's a remedy you can't
[23:16] think you believe certain truths but in
[23:19] your heart is something contrary
[23:24] you can confess your beliefs but do you
[23:28] possess it in your heart at the
[23:30] revelation that's why so Bob and I use
[23:34] the word violets that pertains to life
[23:37] you know in spiritual life especially
[23:38] eternal life so vital to stay in the way
[23:41] to constantly follow below our data grow
[23:45] into the prayer meditation read and
[23:46] listen to the workout Hebrews 4:12 for
[23:53] the word of God is quick and powerful
[23:54] and sharper than a two-edged sword
[23:56] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[23:59] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[24:01] marrow and is a discerner of the
[24:02] thoughts and intents of the heart
[24:03] we aren't worried about as long as we
[24:05] stay in the way you don't worry about
[24:06] what little doctrines you might have in
[24:09] your psyche that's floating around that
[24:11] you really believe and don't realize it
[24:12] because you as long as you stay in the
[24:14] way they'll discern are the thoughts of
[24:17] your heart and he will actually purify
[24:20] you from that thing you know to the
[24:22] process of sanctification he'll take
[24:23] that out and you'll come to it when the
[24:25] word is revealed to you you'll see that
[24:27] running away in opposition that thing
[24:29] that was a false doctor that you didn't
[24:31] even know you believed proverbs 23 eat
[24:35] now I'm not the bread of him that hath
[24:37] an evil eye neither desire thousands
[24:39] thanking me for as he thinketh in his
[24:41] heart so is he
[24:42] he didn't drink say the to be but his
[24:45] heart quickly the point is there as a
[24:46] man thinketh in his heart so is he
[24:55] at Corinthians 7:4 godly sorrow worketh
[24:59] repentance
[25:00] oh this is a lot of time under godly
[25:02] sorrow worketh repentance to salvation
[25:04] on a journey like unto salvation not to
[25:08] be repented of but the sorrow of the
[25:10] world worketh death okay so we're in a
[25:14] journey and if you have real got a big
[25:17] sorrow not just you say you're sorry for
[25:19] you're saying you come to Christ and
[25:21] name a word only and then you throw this
[25:23] blanket you say how a blanket salvation
[25:25] for the rest of my life I can do
[25:26] whatever I want
[25:27] you live like the devil smoking cuts and
[25:29] everything I know we're not doing that
[25:31] here but I'm just saying you know well
[25:34] we're maybe not doing it's going on with
[25:36] the Lord and that sort of a blanket
[25:38] salvation - you thought this blanket and
[25:40] say now say and whatever happens when
[25:43] when when your rapture come when the
[25:44] resurrection happens and the rapture
[25:46] comes and I'll go in because of this
[25:49] blanket salvation but godly sorrow made
[25:51] you always have this panic card all this
[25:53] awful understand will forgive me and and
[25:55] forgive me for the thing that I didn't
[25:56] even know I did wrong forgiving the
[25:58] thing that I believe that I don't even
[25:59] realize I believe and cleanse me from
[26:02] that for this is the next verse from a
[26:05] whole this self same thing that she saw
[26:06] it after a Gandhi sort what carefulness
[26:09] was the was the hair careful or was he
[26:12] sort of careless what carefulness it
[26:15] wrought in you gave what clearing of
[26:17] yourselves yea what indignation yea what
[26:20] fear
[26:21] I'm guessing Polynesians reference what
[26:24] vehement desire I don't think the hair
[26:26] had any Beland desire he was kind of
[26:28] going with the motions on the way of
[26:30] salvation and then he stepped up his
[26:31] side not for
[26:33] fell asleep so that's not any vehement
[26:36] desire getting what zeal gave what
[26:39] revenge
[26:39] you know the tourists had all these
[26:41] traits he kept on going and he wasn't
[26:43] gonna stop he was violent as a Christian
[26:46] he was vomit with you know voltar with
[26:49] God and all things you have to prove
[26:51] yourself to be clear this man
[26:57] all right so here we go again I'm the
[27:00] last little ray leg of the race okay and
[27:07] you noticed and this wasn't actually on
[27:09] the story that I read growing up and I
[27:10] don't feel better notice the picture of
[27:12] it like this before but they put a
[27:14] little heel little Mountain there
[27:15] towards the end of the race in areas
[27:17] fond of the stature of Herbert man
[27:19] and over here sleeps this little guy at
[27:20] the bottom of the hill maybe it faith or
[27:22] whatever you could say he's believing
[27:24] but you know he's he stumble or he's
[27:27] fell asleep and and this tortoise with
[27:31] this positive attitude optimistic he's
[27:34] continuing on and off the stature of
[27:36] Herbert and finish the race
[27:43] and this guy's sort of got this attitude
[27:45] that I'm waiting on him to catch up a
[27:47] lot of people have that month said that
[27:49] I came in years ago I had my experiences
[27:52] and I read that certain book and I
[27:54] already been there and I've done that
[27:55] and now I'm waiting on y'all to catch up
[27:57] well maybe you haven't really started
[27:58] you know get started acts 14 confirming
[28:06] the souls of the disciples and exhorting
[28:07] them to continue in the faith and that
[28:11] we must through much tribulation enter
[28:13] into the kingdom of God not a flowery
[28:14] bed of ease but most tribulation enter
[28:18] into the kingdom of God
[28:24] colossal one and you that were sometimes
[28:27] elevated and enemies in your mind by
[28:28] wicked works yet now happy reconciled so
[28:32] here we were without all these we're
[28:34] alienated with false doctrine and
[28:35] unbelief we came here with sin we can't
[28:37] her and unbelief and enemies in your
[28:40] mind a carnal mind is enmity against God
[28:42] yet now I'm happy reconciled bring us
[28:45] back to Christ he did it not us we just
[28:47] continue in the way documented the
[28:50] stipulation
[28:51] I've been reconciled in the body of his
[28:53] flesh through the death this is like
[28:55] Romans what brother weighs bento man in
[28:56] the barn is flesh through death to
[28:58] present you holy humbling for man are
[29:00] fruitful in a side stipulation if if you
[29:05] continue in the faith grounded and
[29:07] settled and be not moved away from the
[29:08] hope of the gospel which he have heard
[29:12] in which was preached to every creature
[29:13] which is under heaven were appalled
[29:15] minister so here's where the Portus
[29:19] resided but the hair didn't make it
[29:23] there he stopped attend stipulation he
[29:25] didn't go through stop
[29:28] oh he wakes up yeah so the hair awakens
[29:35] and also stories that I've heard of this
[29:37] including the one I heard growing up the
[29:40] hair awakens are the last minute tries
[29:41] to make it but it's too late the
[29:43] courtesans already finished the race now
[29:47] a couple more little slides that are
[29:49] these are good little points for that
[29:50] pertain to this a common saying in
[29:53] aviation is your attitude determines
[29:55] your altitude it's a clever little Sagan
[29:58] it's actually naturally true attitude
[30:01] and reference to an aircraft of any kind
[30:03] refers to its orientation it's on three
[30:06] axes all right it has a pitch axis the
[30:11] nose pitches up and down to climb or
[30:13] descend as a roll axis on which it banks
[30:16] to turn and it has the all axis on which
[30:19] it turns like this way but the most
[30:22] important one is that pitch axis keep
[30:25] the nose up but all these things
[30:27] determine the direction the plane will
[30:29] go if you pitch the nose up you're going
[30:31] to climb and you keep a positive
[30:34] attitude and life in anything
[30:36] pertains to life career finances
[30:39] marriage health and most of all
[30:40] spiritual walk your attitude determines
[30:42] your opportunity and all those things in
[30:44] positive attitude keep pressing the mark
[30:47] of the high calling especially in the
[30:49] spiritual law this is a god that they
[30:53] have remedy quotes a lot of camera who
[30:54] he is the disease David are like the way
[30:56] he stick and your affidavit I think like
[30:58] motivational speaker your attitude not
[31:01] your aptitude what determine your
[31:03] altitude aptitude is something like that
[31:06] pear is something like that it's the
[31:09] natural ability to do something he
[31:10] naturally had the ability to win that
[31:12] race so he was leaning on that anonymous
[31:15] attitude all right this is a truck
[31:19] driver thing here cross rose so when you
[31:23] come to a crossroads in life and
[31:26] anything the first thing to do and
[31:30] determine your desired destination which
[31:32] which where you want to wind up in at
[31:34] the very end study the road map the
[31:36] Bible the perilous road takes you there
[31:39] the most important thing is to stay on
[31:41] that grow
[31:42] no matter how slow you go to stay on the
[31:45] road you get to decide which character
[31:48] you would lady in this story of the
[31:50] parable of the tourists of the hair you
[31:51] can be the tourist or you can be the
[31:53] hair it's absolutely your choice God
[31:55] didn't make you one way you just have to
[31:58] go through life like that and and I've
[32:00] just it's a like a victim mentality like
[32:03] it's all the circumstances fault you
[32:06] know you need to decide and every day I
[32:07] tried to decide to be about toys and try
[32:10] to not be the hair every single day we
[32:12] have to decide that really simple so
[32:16] what exactly do we need to do I've got
[32:18] about three more slider things
[32:20] Bren can push out your friend that quote
[32:22] don't need to read all of it but push
[32:23] out everything you have made up because
[32:25] it's in you when you receive Christ
[32:26] drink and push out and now don't never
[32:30] be afraid to ask big things God wants
[32:32] you to ask the big things they don't
[32:33] want you to be a little petty and
[32:34] juvenile I want you to ask the big
[32:36] things that you're doing there before to
[32:38] make the big things is God revealed to
[32:39] me the silver seven weeks today on and
[32:41] all these great mysteries in your work
[32:42] because you can reveal it to me and in
[32:45] the meantime not going to stay like a
[32:46] lump on the bar but I'm going to go
[32:47] study it and like I said my last lesson
[32:50] I think you want to stem seals ring seal
[32:52] book to understand turn-taking research
[32:54] a good and so on so just keep studying
[32:57] if you don't understand it
[32:58] read it again and keep going don't ever
[33:01] be afraid ask for the big thing
[33:05] and this is one of the one I added
[33:07] question answers the only way the only
[33:09] thing you have to do it's fall in love
[33:11] with him and just go right on loving him
[33:14] yes if you really love the Lord you just
[33:18] won't stop and you know he asked me to
[33:20] drive on the truck at night and struggle
[33:22] with staying awake and have all these
[33:25] battles that I go through trying listen
[33:26] to sermons so I figure Wednesday night
[33:28] that was a choice I made they don't ask
[33:30] my wife to sit up late at night
[33:31] listening to sermons because she don't
[33:34] get a chance to during the day dealing
[33:35] with kids she chose to do that I never
[33:37] told her to and God didn't master it -
[33:39] there are certain things you can choose
[33:41] to do for Christ that you do out of love
[33:42] for him he didn't ask you to do but you
[33:45] do those things and love solves a lot of
[33:47] things but the Bob said Wednesday night
[33:49] talk about that coming up the gospel
[33:52] train things would have called it and
[33:53] said yes all the things that comes that
[33:56] are produced by that are automatic we
[33:58] just put the coals in the fire so what
[34:01] is drinking and pushing out what is
[34:02] putting coals in the fire maybe that's
[34:04] what I'm talking about just knock stop
[34:06] it don't even pray the meta title
[34:08] seeking God spend atomic war it looks
[34:12] like
[34:23] [Music]
