[0:00] that in push that chair in brother um
[0:04] Luis is on his way back you know his U
[0:07] mother law passed so they didn't got the
[0:10] funeral done and the Dad's doing okay so
[0:12] they're coming on back but they're in
[0:14] Pennsylvania um on the way back home so
[0:18] uh and Bob is in Mobile because their
[0:21] family had Chris uh Thanksgiving down
[0:23] there so and then brother Boyd sick
[0:25] remember him this morning Ryan's in
[0:27] there doing Sunday school so we got
[0:30] about got everybody but brother Joe my
[0:33] my old oak tree back there he's here
[0:35] with me so if I fall out he can take
[0:37] over see God always got somebody that
[0:40] can take over old oak tree and not
[0:43] saying old because the old I just mean
[0:45] the old oak tree right but you are a
[0:47] little bit older than most so that's
[0:49] okay you living on bar time
[0:52] too yeah about two years worth but
[0:55] that's good the Lord's good to us you
[0:58] know I was think back in the back in the
[1:01] 50s that a man didn't live till like 47
[1:03] or 48 years
[1:05] old I mean I'm living a b time then 47
[1:08] 48 years old I mean that's that's
[1:10] horrible really but now we got people
[1:12] living in their into their 80s and and
[1:15] doing well so that's good so let's talk
[1:18] about this though so we can get out of
[1:19] this time element thing and get into
[1:23] eternity where the uh where we don't
[1:26] have to worry about age and time won't
[1:28] matter anymore we listening to view the
[1:31] way up here kind of reminded me that
[1:34] that uh we're so much a creature of time
[1:37] to we everything is on a time right
[1:40] everything everything's on time time we
[1:42] got to have time this time we got to
[1:44] make time for
[1:45] this when time won't matter anymore it's
[1:48] going to have to be a revelation because
[1:50] this thing here's got to be changed if
[1:52] it's not changed then we're still
[1:54] looking at time but boy when this thing
[1:56] changed we have no time no time element
[1:59] to look at so Revelation 6 now we went
[2:01] through the first seal now do everybody
[2:04] really I want everybody to really
[2:05] understand that first seal has several
[2:08] points that we want to look at and we're
[2:09] not looking at the negative part the
[2:12] reason we're not looking at the negative
[2:13] part is that I was reading in some of my
[2:17] notes that this Revelation this one God
[2:21] Revelation
[2:23] destroys any Antichrist
[2:26] Spirit you listening to me yeah any and
[2:30] every Antichrist spirit is annihilated
[2:34] when you get a true revelation of one
[2:36] God not that Jesus is a second person of
[2:38] a
[2:40] trinity not that he's two Lords me and
[2:42] Daddy was talking about yesterday you
[2:43] know we um the same brother that
[2:46] preached to two Lords came out with a
[2:48] son of man Ministry but he didn't take
[2:49] it to the bride he only took it to
[2:51] brother brandham and Jesus and look
[2:53] where it led to it led to his two Lord
[2:58] Revelation I'm I'm telling you if you
[3:00] have if you have a if you have a a
[3:02] Ministry or if you have um a thought
[3:06] process and it goes in a certain
[3:08] direction and it takes you into
[3:10] something of error then that's that
[3:12] Antichrist Spirit cu the Antichrist
[3:14] spirit is not cursing drinking smoking
[3:16] running around and doing the things of
[3:17] the world no Antichrist spirit is is one
[3:20] word off you shall not surely die he was
[3:23] quoting God verb him except for one word
[3:27] cuz God said Thou shalt surely die he
[3:29] just put the word not in there Satan did
[3:31] so that Antichrist Spirit was so close
[3:33] and
[3:35] look I I want to be so dogmatic but look
[3:38] how close it was it deceived Adam and
[3:40] Eve in a better condition than we're in
[3:43] right right
[3:46] yeah yeah Adam and Eve were were Sons
[3:49] and Daughters of God Adam was a ruler of
[3:52] the earth he moved
[3:54] trees he moved Tre he he did whatever he
[3:57] wanted to do he was the god this earth
[4:01] now remember he wasn't deceived but Eve
[4:03] was and he went with Eve deception
[4:06] showing that that thing so
[4:08] close that it'll May deceive the very
[4:11] elect then the prophet of God tells us
[4:13] in the church age book that frankly that
[4:16] God's going to have to really cut this
[4:17] thing short cuz as Dad and I were
[4:19] talking about yesterday you look at how
[4:20] much more you say well there's more
[4:22] people coming in the message well how
[4:23] much are coming in under a
[4:25] false how many's coming under a false
[4:27] Ministry well that's false yes I don't
[4:30] care if you fill up a message church
[4:32] with 5,000 people if it's a false
[4:34] message what good is it it's just like a
[4:36] Baptist and a Methodist and Pentecostal
[4:39] right right that's why it that one
[4:42] revelation of one true and living God
[4:43] the true revelation of one true and
[4:45] living God will destroy the Antichrist
[4:48] Spirit that's in you I said that's in
[4:51] you because it motivates you all the
[4:54] time that's right right you look at it
[4:57] motivating a whole world of people that
[4:59] believe uh trinitarian
[5:03] Doctrine and would fight you over and
[5:05] they're going to they're going to kill
[5:06] us or put us out of business not
[5:08] business but put us out of church saw a
[5:10] thing yesterday
[5:13] where and I don't know how this came up
[5:15] I don't know but I was I was on one of
[5:17] my beef forums with on Facebook and this
[5:19] thing pops up and this this man is now
[5:22] trying now watch how this is this man is
[5:25] he put a picture of Joel Olstein
[5:27] everybody know who Joel Olin is
[5:28] multi-millionaire yes got a a
[5:31] multi-million dollar Church yes 15,000
[5:34] people go to his church and he lives in
[5:37] a like a 32,000 ft mansion that's right
[5:40] he don't pay any taxes that's right wow
[5:42] the church don't pay any taxes that's
[5:43] right that's what the whole move is now
[5:46] is to all these people with all these
[5:48] billions and millions of dollars in
[5:50] organized religion they're going to
[5:52] start taxing them mhm they're going to
[5:54] start making them pay taxes or they're
[5:57] not going to let you pay tith on it I
[5:58] mean let you take take your tithe off of
[6:00] your off of your they're going to TI
[6:02] that money you tithe with they're going
[6:04] to tax it that's exactly what it's
[6:06] coming to so you see now
[6:08] watch that's what that Antichrist spirit
[6:10] is doing he's bringing it right in and
[6:12] look he's he's working in secular I mean
[6:14] not secular he's working in
[6:17] Independence he's not working in Baptist
[6:19] Methodist Pentecost and all that he's
[6:20] working in Independence old's an
[6:23] independent he's not a Baptist or
[6:24] Methodist whatever that's true um Jensen
[6:26] Franklin he's he's a um we call he's
[6:30] he's independent he has no Baptist
[6:33] Methodist Pentecostal affiliation he's
[6:35] you watch him go after those
[6:36] Independents first cuz all the Baptist
[6:39] is going to do is like that guy up in
[6:41] gainville said the other day uh Bill
[6:44] coat I'll call his name because he
[6:45] shouldn't be preaching in the Baptist
[6:46] Church he shouldn't be preaching in any
[6:48] church he said oh if the Baptist Church
[6:49] tells me I have to marry a gay person
[6:51] then I'll marry them he said I'll do
[6:54] what the church well you know what you
[6:55] know what he should have said I'll do
[6:57] what the mother Church tells me to do
[6:59] yeah but now thank God there's another
[7:00] one there in Gainesville he's Dr Tom
[7:02] Smiley and he's at Lakewood Baptist and
[7:04] he said I'll never marry gay I don't
[7:05] care he said God didn't God told you not
[7:08] to do it right I don't care who tells
[7:09] you to do it so see that man may make a
[7:12] stand he may make a stand and he may
[7:14] have to give his life for that St that's
[7:16] right right but somebody that says well
[7:17] I'll just do what the mother church or
[7:19] what the you know the Baptist Church
[7:21] tells me to do they tell me to marry
[7:23] gays I'll marry gay and he said that on
[7:24] radio wow so you know he made his he
[7:28] made his public outcry
[7:30] so brother you know Tom Smiley comes in
[7:31] says well I'm making mine I'll never
[7:33] marry cuz he said it's against the Bible
[7:35] not what man says it's against the Bible
[7:36] it's not what rulership says it's
[7:38] against the Bible right so that's what
[7:41] we're coming down to and you know what
[7:42] it's coming from it's coming from these
[7:43] seals it's coming from a revelation of
[7:46] what's going on with the bride of Jesus
[7:48] Christ is what it's affecting everything
[7:50] in the world yes everything in the world
[7:53] is affected by me and you because you
[7:55] know what bomb can't fall that's what I
[7:58] talking about t you you got to take I'm
[8:00] going talk to you today okay fear take
[8:02] fear away there's one thing for sure
[8:04] everybody's talking about well Trump's
[8:06] got his finger on the nuclear thing and
[8:08] Putin can drop a bomb any minute the
[8:11] prophet of God prophesied told us not
[8:14] one bomb will hit this Earth nuclear
[8:17] bomb will hit this Earth while the
[8:18] bride's here so you know what I take
[8:20] that and when somebody ever says
[8:21] anything about that I just move it over
[8:23] and put it in trash
[8:25] can cuz I got to believe I'm a prophet I
[8:27] got to believe that God through a
[8:28] prophet spoke says don't worry about the
[8:30] atomic bomb okay I ain't worried about
[8:32] that going off not while I'm here it may
[8:35] be coming and it may be fired when we
[8:37] get out of here but it won't hit this in
[8:39] other words what am I saying I'm not
[8:41] going to be affected by it you're not
[8:43] going to be affect if you're bride in
[8:44] Jesus Christ you're not going to be
[8:45] affected by an atomic bomb so don't
[8:46] worry about these dirty bombs and all
[8:48] that stuff because you got to remember
[8:49] what a prophet said and that's why God
[8:51] sent a prophet like brother Dale was
[8:53] saying the other day you have to realize
[8:55] one thing God God sends prophets for
[8:59] three three things remember when he was
[9:00] talking about in church ages what he
[9:02] comes he brings a message he absolutely
[9:04] has a message if you turn it down well
[9:07] let's look he got a message if he turns
[9:08] it down what judgment that's right right
[9:11] but now if you receive it it's what
[9:14] Mercy right it's Mercy right it's
[9:17] judgment to one and mercy to the other
[9:20] remember I preached about the the spirit
[9:22] of Elijah that's why God had to bring
[9:23] that Spirit of Elijah because he could
[9:25] handle two sets of of women our churches
[9:28] the widow woman says I'll make the last
[9:31] cake and give it to Elijah Jezebel said
[9:34] I ain't have nothing to do with him he's
[9:36] a thorn in my side I'm going to have him
[9:38] killed well which one ended up it was
[9:41] Mercy to the widow woman that's it was
[9:43] judgment to Jezebel okay so you see what
[9:46] we're looking at here is the same with
[9:48] the prophet of God when he come in the
[9:49] end time to
[9:51] preach as we were kind of discussing
[9:53] yesterday or day before yesterday if
[9:56] this is the apex of the message of the
[9:59] hour
[10:00] then this is the the realm that brother
[10:02] randam said he wor had never worked in a
[10:03] spiritual realm as this realm before now
[10:07] you go back to John the Baptist John the
[10:10] Baptist was the greatest Prophet right
[10:14] of the Old Testament coming down Jesus
[10:16] said that's right there's no greater
[10:18] than John but the least in the Kingdom
[10:20] now we know that but he let's stop it
[10:21] right there he said there's no greater
[10:22] Prophet than John John preached for 6
[10:26] months and had zero healing C campaign
[10:29] mhm zero brother BR said he did no
[10:33] Miracle that's right the Bible never
[10:35] records him doing one Miracle no that's
[10:36] right all he done was what he do he
[10:38] preached the gospel he was that John he
[10:40] was that Elijah the come that what gave
[10:43] Mercy to the people that accepted Jesus
[10:45] Christ and judgment to herodia and all
[10:47] the other ones of course he got his head
[10:49] cut off for that but that was still his
[10:51] message right he walked right up and
[10:52] said her you ain't supposed to have that
[10:54] woman married and divorce is that why
[10:56] it's called a double-edged sword because
[10:59] it's one word that's correct two things
[11:01] that's correct it produces judgment it
[11:04] does it produces judgment but it
[11:05] produces Grace that's right see because
[11:08] the Judgment of this United States of
[11:10] America is because they turned down the
[11:12] prophet's message he came from this
[11:15] country he was from here American right
[11:18] he was one of ours right but they're
[11:20] going to receive judgment before anybody
[11:22] else because they took the the um
[11:25] condemnation or rejected him but the
[11:27] Bride of Jesus Christ is going to come
[11:29] out from all over the world and we're
[11:30] going to accept him and we're going to
[11:31] be harbored in sure we may have a tough
[11:33] time but we're going to be harbored by
[11:35] what that Prophet said not one bomb will
[11:38] fall till the bride's gone so see now
[11:41] that don't mean we might miss a meal or
[11:43] two or we might have to you know be put
[11:45] in the C so what big deal that's
[11:48] right we won't be eaten by lions do what
[11:52] we won't we won't be eaten by lines
[11:54] right that's
[11:56] good you never
[11:58] know he say it says here in Luke no
[12:00] Prophet is accepted in his own country
[12:02] that's right that's right that's what
[12:05] Dad and I were talking about the other
[12:06] day you take and we're kind of off the
[12:08] subject but still we got to we got to
[12:10] expound on what the prophet
[12:12] brought he came and and you can take
[12:15] Jesus's life and his life and parallel
[12:17] it right to the
[12:20] te cuz Jesus said I've come to my
[12:24] own and my own has received me not what
[12:26] he come to the house of Israel right
[12:29] brother random came to the what the
[12:30] Pentecostal that's right that's right
[12:32] and what did they do they rejected him
[12:35] what did the Pharisees and the and the
[12:37] Israelites do they rejected Jesus you
[12:39] can bring it right down and you see but
[12:43] look at Jesus Jesus spoke and said my
[12:45] words are are eternal life and all these
[12:48] things well one group turned him
[12:51] down one group on the day of Pentecost
[12:53] rose up and that's why we have
[12:55] Christianity around the world because of
[12:56] that 120 in the upper room it's kind of
[12:59] hard to to realize that but that's where
[13:01] the that's where Christianity came
[13:03] from no one knew there wasn't no
[13:05] internet or telephone or TV or whatever
[13:07] there was 120 people in that upper room
[13:09] that got the Holy Ghost the 3,000
[13:12] outside okay so you got 3120 people they
[13:16] got the holy ghost in a day there and
[13:19] they went out and spread whatever we see
[13:20] of Christianity that's exactly where it
[13:23] came from all right so we must we we've
[13:26] took the foundation brother Brown took
[13:27] us back to the foundation but he act he
[13:29] built that thing up and remember that
[13:32] Capstone this love that's the main point
[13:35] of the
[13:36] seal is that the love of God brought
[13:39] this to us to get us out of here amen it
[13:42] was sealed up people would probe at it
[13:44] and look at it and some of them would
[13:47] hit parts of it but missed most of it
[13:49] well see that's the
[13:51] devil you can't miss the word of God and
[13:54] be
[13:55] God you can't you cannot miss all of
[13:59] God's word and and and be of be of the
[14:02] devil if you get all the word right but
[14:04] if you just get you can preach hey man
[14:06] they people in this
[14:08] message I've heard them preach and
[14:10] preach like a house on fire and a windy
[14:13] day really enjoyed it two month two
[14:16] months later brother was sleeping with a
[14:18] 14-year-old girl in his church well that
[14:21] happened 10 years ago he's done been in
[14:23] prison out and everything so wow but he
[14:25] was good he was a good preacher just
[14:27] right up here in South Carolina
[14:30] heard him myself a couple of times did a
[14:31] real good job wonderful job gifts and
[14:34] callings are without repentance that's
[14:36] right gifts and callings are without
[14:37] repentance so we have to watch and see
[14:40] that not all Israel is Israel but when
[14:42] we come down to these seals there's only
[14:43] one group of people going to get it all
[14:46] one group of people's going to get all
[14:47] of
[14:48] it and it can't be those that hadn't
[14:50] heard any of it that's
[14:53] true right it can't be that this is not
[14:57] going to come to you just sitting in a
[15:00] swing in your front on your front porch
[15:02] That's right right it's got to come
[15:04] through a through Ministry because the
[15:06] Bible says the five-fold ministry is for
[15:08] the perfecting of the Saints to me this
[15:10] is for the perfecting of the Saints so
[15:12] we get this first seal finished true
[15:15] justification now not to say the other
[15:17] one's false now remember brother ROM
[15:20] explains that because the Bible says the
[15:21] faithful and true witness not that he
[15:23] was a false witness but remember you and
[15:25] we use the we use the slang and it's not
[15:28] really but we say well you know well
[15:31] that just that just Rings true to my
[15:34] heart well not that it was
[15:36] false it was so true it had a it just
[15:39] had an Essence about it that was more
[15:41] than anything you'd ever heard it wasn't
[15:43] that it was false and become true
[15:44] because Jesus Christ the faithful and
[15:46] true witness there was no time he wasn't
[15:47] true that's right it was always true but
[15:50] brother R explains that and uh in the
[15:53] seal but the faithful and true witness
[15:54] the beginning of the creation of God
[15:56] that's Revelation 3:14 all right so
[15:58] that's same way with this this is this
[16:00] is the true revelation of
[16:03] God coming to you and I and we should
[16:07] um reverence it and try to study it
[16:10] because it's it's not it's not something
[16:12] that we need to lightly go over but true
[16:15] true justification
[16:16] is the real you didn't do it
[16:20] right the real you never did it okay and
[16:24] I want to try to get into that one day
[16:26] about the the dividing of the Soul and
[16:28] Spirit but we'll do that
[16:29] long time from now
[16:31] justification one God Revelation see if
[16:34] we don't get that one God Revelation
[16:35] right that's your foundation right see
[16:38] they had it right why they were the
[16:40] foundation they had it right they didn't
[16:42] have a trinitarian Doctrine they didn't
[16:44] have a two Lord they didn't have a Jesus
[16:46] wasn't God to the River Jordan well we
[16:48] you saw people had ideas of that but
[16:51] when they built that Foundation to this
[16:54] church on the revelation of one true and
[16:56] living God the Son of God on this rock
[16:59] I'll build my church that's what he
[17:01] built it on what happened is is down
[17:03] through the church ages
[17:06] man man got in and started putting
[17:09] little ideas and little this and well
[17:10] maybe he wasn't or it looks like he was
[17:13] a second person or it looks like this
[17:14] looks like that that was man's idea but
[17:17] what's got to happen is is that that is
[17:19] got to come back the faith of the
[17:21] fathers has to be restored by a
[17:24] profit then bring the
[17:27] seals it's very true for from 47 to 1963
[17:30] brother R was just building the church
[17:32] back up right just like Elijah when the
[17:35] prophet prophets of
[17:37] baale he called him on Mount carel and
[17:40] said call on you God I give you all day
[17:43] I give you all week you got all and what
[17:46] happened they jumped on top of the altar
[17:48] so much so if you'll watch the Bible
[17:50] says when they got
[17:52] finished Elijah put the altar back
[17:56] together he had to restore the
[17:59] foundation before God could come down
[18:02] and take that sacrifice read your Bible
[18:05] it's a perfect perfect perfect perfect
[18:07] that Ministry of Elijah had to be used
[18:09] because that's the perfect way that the
[18:11] same thing happened with brother Brandon
[18:13] the prophets of baale mhm denominational
[18:17] ideas the prophets of Baal tore the tore
[18:21] the true worship down altar pour the
[18:24] altar down but somebody had to come back
[18:27] and build it back up put it back
[18:28] together so that Ministry of Elijah is a
[18:30] Ministry of what
[18:33] restoration restore the faith of the
[18:36] fathers okay then bring his message
[18:39] which is this okay okay he was he says
[18:42] I'm making a way for someone to come he
[18:44] just didn't know he was the one at that
[18:46] time God had probably hid it from him
[18:48] and I'm sure he did God don't tell you
[18:49] prophets everything remember that's
[18:51] right right right he has it has to be
[18:54] revealed to him and then when he comes
[18:55] up to that first seal and he's getting
[18:57] ready to make a mistake and we already
[18:58] ready that where he said I'm going to I
[18:59] was going to make a horrible
[19:01] mistake when God took that what he had
[19:05] preached and said no that's not right
[19:06] but this is it well he knew right then
[19:08] that he was working in a realm that he
[19:09] never worked before cuz God himself was
[19:12] directing him where to go all right so
[19:15] there was another horse now we got he's
[19:17] got off a white horse now he's got on a
[19:19] red horse cuz he's got these people
[19:21] believing what he
[19:23] say all right he's getting off that
[19:25] white righteous church and letting them
[19:27] ride on that white righteous Church is
[19:28] still here today right right they think
[19:30] they're right that's right right all
[19:32] right so then he gets on another horse
[19:36] that was red and power was giv him that
[19:39] set on to take peace from the
[19:41] earth now you can say that's natural and
[19:43] spiritual peace because you know what if
[19:45] you have peace with God it's when you
[19:47] have a revelation when you know where
[19:49] you're at you have peace with God when
[19:51] you don't know where you're at you can't
[19:52] have peace with God that's right all
[19:53] right oh sure we got things that fight
[19:55] us and get us on the outside man or the
[19:58] spirit of us but that inside Soul once
[20:01] that thing's locked in this right here
[20:04] once that thing's locked in that lion l
[20:06] i o n lion of the tribe of
[20:09] Judah no fear a lion has no fear right
[20:15] so you got to get that Fear Factor out
[20:16] of
[20:19] them so power was giv him to take peace
[20:22] from the earth what he do he starts in a
[20:24] Doctrine yes
[20:26] right and that they should kill one
[20:29] another now we know that that physically
[20:31] happened because remember the first
[20:33] three ages typed the first seal right
[20:36] right we went through that
[20:38] already the second seal types this age
[20:41] right here that long Church age where 68
[20:44] million Protestants were killed by the
[20:47] Catholic Church on their own records so
[20:50] what is killing killing one
[20:53] another right right and there was given
[20:57] unto him a great sword what a word right
[21:00] that's so close that it would deceive
[21:01] the very elect if it were possible right
[21:04] all right excuse me so
[21:07] now let's take our
[21:09] symbols when we come up to this second
[21:14] seal what Beast is this Beast here the
[21:18] second beast says come and see it's the
[21:21] ox cuz you got lion ox man and Eagle now
[21:26] you say what is that that is the Holy
[21:28] Ghost
[21:31] what Brother D and I were talking about
[21:32] the other day the only reason that we
[21:33] can be the fullness of the godhead B is
[21:35] we have everything that's
[21:37] right that's right Paul couldn't be the
[21:39] fullness of the godhead B he was in the
[21:41] lion age lion age right okay cuz it's
[21:44] promised that we have an needle age
[21:46] that's right brother Bob asked me
[21:48] something other day he said well why so
[21:50] I said Bob the Bible says he can't do
[21:52] that God can't do things that he wants
[21:55] to do because he the words already said
[21:57] he can't do that okay don't you think
[21:59] Jesus wanted to come back okay brother R
[22:01] said he he said he could have raised as
[22:02] soon as he died that what he said that's
[22:04] right Jesus could have raised as soon as
[22:06] he died but he was barred by scripture
[22:08] that he had to be in the heart of the
[22:10] earth three days and three nights right
[22:12] that's right so he was barred by that
[22:13] scripture it wasn't that that that he
[22:16] was well I got to wait well no he had a
[22:19] job to do that's right there's other
[22:21] scripture to be fulfilled it's not like
[22:22] that God well see now God's not one up
[22:25] the son of man left the Earth right
[22:28] right that's right in the Ascension the
[22:30] son of man left the Earth the flesh God
[22:32] left the Earth that's right now he's not
[22:34] coming
[22:35] back as son of man his listen to me his
[22:39] flesh till the
[22:41] Millennium but he's got to come back in
[22:43] your
[22:44] flesh to take us to his flesh CU we'll
[22:47] have a body like unto his glorious body
[22:50] Brother Ray that's what connects us
[22:51] together see all right but the Son of
[22:54] God never left the
[22:55] Earth right son of God's a spirit God
[22:58] Son of God is from the foundation before
[23:00] the foundation of the world right that's
[23:03] right when you say son of God it's not
[23:04] Jesus that's right the flesh man that's
[23:07] right that's son of man but the Son of
[23:10] God that's why I I really enjoy what
[23:12] brother Dale was bringing out because
[23:14] that's no one has ever understood the
[23:17] son of man Revelation until this end
[23:19] time why because we have the lion ox man
[23:21] and Eagle we have everything that we
[23:24] need the word has been open once these
[23:26] seals were open there's no other word to
[23:27] be open
[23:29] right none zero cuz if this takes us to
[23:33] the change of the body all the rest of
[23:35] it is commentary what's going to happen
[23:36] after we get body change that's right
[23:38] you hear me commentary not Revelation
[23:42] cuz we know one thing for sure when we
[23:43] get leave this earth and go over into
[23:46] another dimension see that's why that's
[23:48] why brother Brown couldn't take his body
[23:50] to the sixth
[23:51] Dimension that's why we're here that's
[23:53] why we're barred here by this remember
[23:56] brother BR had went to the sixth
[23:57] dimension but he looked back in his but
[24:00] why why did he have to say that God had
[24:03] to show me and you one things for sure
[24:05] that's what's holding us
[24:07] here that body he said I turned around
[24:09] looked he said I was moving on the bed
[24:11] that was his flesh his flesh didn't go
[24:13] in the sixth Dimension no cuz he has not
[24:16] reached immortality there's only one man
[24:18] the son of man is the only one that
[24:19] could go in and come back out right cuz
[24:21] remember he died Rose ascended come back
[24:23] remember he said don't touch me yet I
[24:25] have not ascended he went up and come
[24:26] back live for 30 40 days
[24:29] on the earth and then went out of here
[24:31] now he's working in me and you but we
[24:33] have everything now that we need to be
[24:35] the fullness of the godhead by true
[24:37] Paul's a part of it
[24:39] right but Paul didn't have a revelation
[24:41] that you got that's
[24:43] right John even John saw all this but
[24:47] he's just writing he's writing a
[24:48] commentary exactly all right and I want
[24:51] you to understand thing it's not that
[24:52] we're not trying to do away with the
[24:53] Bible but we understand once our B's
[24:55] changed what's going to happen we're
[24:58] going to a wedding supper it's real
[24:59] plain what I'm saying is we're going to
[25:01] wedding supper and we don't have to know
[25:03] the details that's right we're going to
[25:05] live a thousand years the Bible says in
[25:07] the Millennium where the son of David is
[25:09] going to rule and Reign all right that's
[25:12] common to us right that's right so what
[25:15] are we waiting on we're we're waiting on
[25:17] number one
[25:19] Resurrection first we're not waiting on
[25:21] body change first we got to get them
[25:22] people out of the ground first then we
[25:24] take a body chain that's right we what
[25:26] you're alive and remain that's right
[25:28] shall be caught up together with them so
[25:30] the resurrection is next the body change
[25:31] is not next we don't get a body change
[25:33] till later
[25:36] on the
[25:38] Bible we got to get them out of the
[25:39] ground first once we get them out of the
[25:41] ground see then then then like said
[25:44] cendy the fear goes the fear goes away
[25:46] when I can see somebody that's walked
[25:48] with me walking in a glorified body I'm
[25:52] going to know real quick uhuh brother r
[25:54] that that old arthritis is fixing the
[25:57] leave
[25:59] and that gray hair is fixing to leave
[26:01] and that that we've lost is fixing to
[26:03] leave all right so see we now what fear
[26:06] would you have bring a gun bring an
[26:08] atomic bomb throw something at me I
[26:11] don't care it ain't going to bother me I
[26:12] think C is going to give us the faith I
[26:15] think that's where where yeah I think
[26:16] that's going to trigger now we going to
[26:18] have it and be waiting right but that's
[26:19] going to trigger that one last little
[26:23] right well Hey listen if we can stand
[26:26] and say dead from
[26:29] Paul to
[26:32] today come out of the Grave okay right
[26:36] don't you think you can't stand there
[26:37] and say all power in Heaven and Earth
[26:38] has been given unto me yes whatever I
[26:41] say that's what will happen that's right
[26:43] cuz it says what you say it don't put a
[26:45] stipulation on it says what you say
[26:47] that's right so that's what's bringing
[26:48] that's what's keeping them in the grave
[26:49] now is is we haven't come to that we
[26:52] haven't got rid of that fear factor of
[26:54] walking out in the graveyard we don't
[26:55] have to walk out in the graveyard we'd
[26:56] be preaching here and just a Revelation
[26:58] strike a group of people and the dead
[27:01] will come Among Us that sixth Dimension
[27:02] will open up and they'll just walk right
[27:03] straight in here right see how glorious
[27:06] this is I mean that's why I said about
[27:08] these seals that you can sit here for
[27:10] years and just preach on one
[27:12] seal right
[27:14] here what does red
[27:17] mean in in most of our terms that means
[27:20] killing and something
[27:22] bad but in our spiritual walk it's the
[27:25] greatest thing that could ever happen
[27:27] that's right amen amen red on red is
[27:30] what
[27:31] white we take the blood of Jesus Christ
[27:34] cleanses us from what all sin all sin
[27:39] all right so we see that red now is we
[27:42] have the one of the four beasts says
[27:45] come and see that's the ox that was the
[27:47] longest Church age the ox is a labor
[27:48] he's not real fast but what he's
[27:51] steady a word was given to the people
[27:56] not just one man say gives it to the
[27:58] people the people's one that take the
[28:01] the message to take peace from the
[28:04] earth and look at the termoil I mean not
[28:07] just naturally there's there's natural
[28:08] turmoil on the earth anyway but look at
[28:10] the spiritual turmoil everybody's got
[28:13] spiritual turmoil we don't know whether
[28:14] we're going to do this one we you know
[28:16] this one's going to do this and this
[28:17] one's going to do that we don't know
[28:18] about this one I'm talking about in the
[28:20] message I a't worried about them people
[28:22] out there no I'm worried about the
[28:25] turmoil of the of the um Pharisees that
[28:29] are standing in the door and not letting
[28:31] their people go in their people want
[28:33] more and the Pharisees standing at the
[28:36] door not letting them and they won't go
[28:38] in now I'm quoting your scripture okay
[28:41] and guess what that happened in Jesus's
[28:43] time and I want you to give you one
[28:45] little key while brother Dale was
[28:46] preaching if the son of man Ministries
[28:48] to come back on the earth I said if I'm
[28:50] asking you a
[28:52] question if the son of man Ministry is
[28:54] supposed to be here on Earth at the end
[28:55] time all you got to do is that's why
[28:57] he's telling us to read Matthew Le and
[28:58] John right that's what happened while
[29:01] the son of man was
[29:02] here acts is the Son of
[29:05] God through Corinthians not that's the
[29:08] Son of God Revelation that's what they
[29:09] built the church on but Matthew Mark
[29:11] Luke and John is what happens when the
[29:14] son of man's on the earth now if he's
[29:15] got to come back again in the end time
[29:18] the same identical thing got to happen
[29:20] now we saw it in part with brother Brown
[29:22] he fulfilled a lot of that but the bride
[29:25] has got to fulfill all of that three and
[29:28] a half year Ministry okay that's why I
[29:30] said we've got three and a half years or
[29:32] now we've only got three years to 2019
[29:34] so we're I think we're in that Ministry
[29:37] that we need to get something out of
[29:38] that three and A2 years or 3 years now
[29:41] since October be 3 years I still believe
[29:44] something's going to out in 2019 I don't
[29:45] know what it is but I just um It's Kind
[29:48] kind of funny it is funny it really is
[29:51] but um we have a church credit card we
[29:54] have a credit card for us and then we
[29:55] have two debit cards they all run out in
[29:57] 2019
[30:04] every one of them does every one of them
[30:06] Runs Out in
[30:07] 2019 so do they run out in 2019 told
[30:13] you that's just that's to me that's
[30:16] people people preach about stuff like
[30:17] that I'm not going to preach about
[30:19] something like that but but it is kind
[30:20] of odd when you look down and
[30:23] go what's going happen here 2019 they
[30:26] figure out something going to happen in
[30:28] 2019 by that time we should know what's
[30:30] going on you'll have the word in this
[30:33] word yeah that's correct mine is 2020
[30:35] what that
[30:45] mean let's continue
[30:49] on you ain't going to make it s there
[30:52] went out another see what I mean you can
[30:54] start doctrines like that and people get
[30:56] you'll get a complex I wasn't worry a
[30:58] thing about it I was just looking the
[30:59] other day and I was thinking about 2019
[31:01] and I just looked down at one and I
[31:03] bought something online the other day
[31:04] for Daddy from church and I looked down
[31:06] at it and it said 2019 and then I looked
[31:08] down and I said the debit card says 2019
[31:11] and I looked at the credit card it says
[31:15] 2019 I just praise God that we don't
[31:18] have no debts when we get out of here
[31:21] right the debt was paid at Calvary amen
[31:25] that's what that was amen so you see the
[31:28] symbolism that Satan's using he's using
[31:31] the same symbol to kill you with mhm
[31:35] Jesus is using the same symbol to kill
[31:37] you
[31:38] with hello cuz all you got to die R and
[31:43] this tells you that the U Is Dead
[31:45] Redemption starts with the three letters
[31:47] that's right Redemption starts with
[31:49] three letters r e d so it's
[31:53] Redemption pretty good yeah that's Prett
[31:56] good wow woo
[32:00] here finish that was good no that's
[32:03] really good cuz you look at words like
[32:04] that and you see that's why Redemption
[32:06] starts with
[32:08] red you're not going to ever be redeemed
[32:10] Until you realize that the blood of
[32:12] Jesus Christ 2,000 years ago that fell
[32:14] on this Earth not just a literal blood
[32:17] no no no no no no that literal blood was
[32:19] washed away and the Roman um soldiers
[32:22] just washed it down the the drain like
[32:24] every other blood that was there it was
[32:26] the life that was in that man that's
[32:28] right and we know that he gave that red
[32:30] blood that had the life in it for me and
[32:33] you well he didn't do it for you he did
[32:34] it for me excuse me did it for me well
[32:37] you got yeah well you say excuse me he
[32:39] did it for me I don't know about you he
[32:41] did it for
[32:43] me so there was another horse that was
[32:45] red so now we're going to we need to
[32:47] change
[32:48] our um thought process a little bit to
[32:51] where a white righteous church has now
[32:52] turned into a killing Church a church
[32:56] that kills kills by what surely kills by
[33:00] the regular sword but also kills by
[33:03] sword is always a word in the Bible
[33:06] right excuse me sword is always the word
[33:08] in the Bible all right so but look what
[33:11] was given to him who give it to it the
[33:15] people the power of the people in that
[33:17] age gave the Roman Catholic
[33:20] Church the ability to go out and kill 68
[33:24] million people I mean you just can't
[33:27] just do that on your own you just can't
[33:29] I mean my heaven 68
[33:32] million that's a third of the United
[33:35] States of America wiped out in a
[33:38] thousand years 68
[33:40] million I mean wow that's to me that's
[33:43] staggering that they could go out no
[33:46] Authority stepped in and stopped that's
[33:48] what I'm that's what I'm trying to say
[33:50] that was so much ingrain that the people
[33:52] just said well okay yeah well I killed
[33:55] 50,000 people today well okay it was all
[33:58] in the name of
[34:00] religion it was all in the name of
[34:02] mother the mother Church you
[34:05] know mother church is what is what
[34:08] killed them spiritually all right so
[34:10] they should kill one another now let's
[34:12] go to
[34:12] Matthew and read what it said in Matthew
[34:16] and
[34:18] uh
[34:21] 24 verse
[34:24] 6 and you'll hear the same thing cuz
[34:26] remember the four and five was the first
[34:29] seal Jesus preaching the seals he's
[34:32] preaching the seals that John is going
[34:35] to write about Jesus is telling you
[34:37] what's going to happen before it even
[34:38] happens for nation you you shall hear
[34:41] I'm sorry verse six and you shall hear
[34:44] wars and rumors of wars now what does a
[34:46] war do a war kills I've never seen a war
[34:48] anybody have a war that somebody didn't
[34:50] die and something red didn't come out of
[34:52] their body you understand what I'm
[34:53] saying so war is red killing and rumors
[34:57] of
[34:58] Wars in other words war and War to come
[35:02] all right see that you be not troubled
[35:05] remember if you're not troubled that
[35:07] means you don't fear that right
[35:10] okay you know what our problem is we
[35:13] fear that boy called death and I say boy
[35:16] cuz it's not a man that Boy Called Death
[35:18] we fear that something's going to happen
[35:20] and it's going to take us out of here
[35:21] why
[35:23] why why you should never fear death
[35:28] that's right well you going to be
[35:29] separated from my loved ones you got
[35:30] more over there than you do here that's
[35:32] right that's
[35:34] right you got more family members over
[35:36] there they had a big Thanksgiving feast
[35:38] the other day we just have a little
[35:40] small one with our family but that's the
[35:42] family you're going to live eternity
[35:43] with right and I'm poting like that but
[35:45] they're just right there in another
[35:46] faster place right beside of
[35:50] us that's why you got to listen to what
[35:53] the prophet say I'm still working on
[35:54] Dimensions but I haven't got it right
[35:55] where I can bring it where I can prove a
[35:57] lot of things cuz I don't want to just
[35:59] throw stuff out I don't want it to be
[36:00] circumstantial evidence we know how that
[36:02] we know how that worked out so I don't
[36:05] want to have circumstantial evidence
[36:06] sometimes you have to use it every once
[36:08] in a while but you never can win a case
[36:09] with circumstantial evidence but brother
[36:11] randam said that they're just 20 ft away
[36:17] at a
[36:18] slant now when he went across the
[36:20] curtain of time he was in the sixth
[36:22] Dimension right right now watch what he
[36:24] asked the angel he said I want to see
[36:27] Jesus
[36:28] what did the angel say you can't see him
[36:30] because he's
[36:32] higher in other words he's 20 more feet
[36:34] away from you at a slant but he's in a
[36:36] faster Dimension he's right there you
[36:39] don't know I mean my Heavens Jesus was
[36:41] watching over the whole thing amen so
[36:44] you see you you watch what brother Brown
[36:46] says and you and you show it shows he
[36:49] definitely knew about Dimensions he knew
[36:52] what was going
[36:53] on all right be not troubled for all
[36:56] these things must come to pass that's
[36:58] right so they got to happen that's right
[37:00] we can't stop what's going to happen
[37:03] that's right it's going to happen that's
[37:05] true these things must come to pass but
[37:08] the end is not yet for nation shall rise
[37:10] against Nation kingdoms against Kingdom
[37:12] that should be famines pestilence
[37:13] earthquakes and D places now we know for
[37:17] sure that these seals are going to
[37:19] literally open during the tribulation
[37:21] period right we know that right those
[37:24] two prophets are going to have control
[37:25] of a lot of these things but you going
[37:27] to have Nation Rising against Nation
[37:28] read read Revelations thought I read it
[37:31] the other day Revelations where is it
[37:33] where the um Babylon is bombed and
[37:35] killed you know they're going to they're
[37:37] going to drop a bomb on the Vatican in
[37:38] one day it's going to be destroyed so
[37:39] the Bible tells you that nations are
[37:41] going to rise up against Nation well you
[37:42] see that happening now right yes did you
[37:45] see the other day where that we I'm
[37:47] talking about we the United States found
[37:48] the largest deposit of oil in
[37:52] Texas 50 something billion
[37:55] barrels that would last us for hundreds
[37:57] of years if we just got it all out
[37:59] oursel and used it well you don't think
[38:01] the Middle East people watching that
[38:04] stuff we start pulling away from their
[38:06] oil guess what's going to happen they're
[38:08] going to get mad they going to start
[38:10] what a war to put us right back over
[38:12] there watch everything happens when we
[38:14] start pulling thing out everything out
[38:16] the war you got to go back to the Middle
[38:18] East everything's got to go back to the
[38:20] Middle East everything that's right cuz
[38:22] that's where it's all going to happen
[38:24] that's right earthquakes there happen so
[38:26] many earthquakes in Oklahoma now
[38:28] and in Arkansas they're having them
[38:30] almost daily you know why they figured
[38:32] that out the other day I read it on the
[38:33] Internet it's got to be
[38:37] true it was on the news it's got to be
[38:39] true it was on Clinton News Network I
[38:42] mean
[38:46] CNN all that fracking they're doing all
[38:50] that digging see now they don't go
[38:51] straight down but they're Drilling and
[38:53] I'm I'm going to end right there cuz
[38:54] we'll talk about second next Sunday but
[38:56] they're drill they don't drill down
[38:58] anymore they drill at an angle and when
[39:01] they get to a spot they can't that they
[39:02] need to loosen it up they put a bomb
[39:05] down there and they Frack it that's why
[39:07] they call fracturing that's why it's
[39:08] called fracking it's fracturing the
[39:10] ground well hey if you fracture the
[39:12] ground that's been there for millions of
[39:14] years right and it's sitting there and
[39:18] then all of a sudden you start busting
[39:19] it up underneath then you start
[39:21] sucking listen the life blow out all of
[39:24] you that have been in science know the
[39:26] law of displacement you have to put when
[39:29] you put something in and you take it out
[39:32] there's a hole if you don't put
[39:34] something back in there there's a hole
[39:36] and guess what's going to
[39:37] happen going to
[39:39] collapse so that's what it's going to be
[39:43] you watch we're having earthquakes now
[39:45] in many places not just
[39:47] California everywhere they're have
[39:49] Oklahoma like I said they're having them
[39:50] once every two three weeks they're
[39:52] having a and they're not having the
[39:53] little bitty ones 5.1 5.6 and all that
[39:58] so and really Listen People we're
[40:00] destroying ourselves man has always
[40:02] destroyed your we we're destroying
[40:04] ourselves I don't see how the Middle
[40:06] East hadn't done sunk down with as much
[40:09] oil since the 20s they've started
[40:10] pulling oil out from underneath all that
[40:12] Sandy stuff right cuz see when the
[40:14] earthquak start it's like me and Dad
[40:16] we're talking about other day it's not
[40:17] just going to be earthquakes going
[40:18] destroy California the whole world's
[40:19] going to be impacted that's right we
[40:21] don't realize the thing that brother B
[40:23] said he said he saw Florida underwater
[40:25] mhm Florida's only 200 100 ft above sea
[40:28] level Florida California goes so when
[40:31] California goes down there's law of
[40:33] displacement when you when goes out
[40:35] something got to come back and when it
[40:38] does it's going to raise do you know
[40:39] that I was reading this the other day 10
[40:41] million people on the East Coast live at
[40:44] or below sea level wow wow at or below
[40:47] not above cuz remember all in New
[40:49] Orleans is below sea level yes it is
[40:51] they keep it pumped out by them big old
[40:53] pump that's right well they ain't going
[40:54] to be a look they and Katrina what
[40:56] happened when Katrina just a little
[40:57] hurricane well it was a big one but
[40:59] watch what happened the whole town was
[41:00] flooded why the PPKs were so overwhelmed
[41:03] well hey when California
[41:05] sinks you better be right because you
[41:07] won't be able to travel everything's
[41:08] going to be where you can't go anywhere
[41:11] Communications um electrical all that
[41:14] stuff's going to be gone going to be
[41:16] shot and you and I are going to have to
[41:18] what trust in that third pull but that's
[41:20] what they're doing in Jamaica you
[41:22] remember when we first went over there
[41:24] they get that uh what is it they get out
[41:27] boite box aluminum box box okay they get
[41:31] it and dig big holes I mean just huge ho
[41:36] now they're realizing that that's going
[41:39] to so they're making them fill that back
[41:41] up but those was just cold bigger than
[41:44] well there was nobody telling them they
[41:46] can't so they just s over there and just
[41:48] took half of Jamaica away yeah cuz box
[41:50] site is not really aluminum but it's the
[41:52] ore that you make aluminum out of so you
[41:54] got to have boxit so you can have
[41:55] aluminum so Alco or Al
[41:57] Alcoa went over there and they just
[41:59] leveled mountains they just took that
[42:01] stuff out like brother Keith said they
[42:03] stealing our Island one shovel load at a
[42:06] time yeah so but finally they decided
[42:09] that they better make them they're
[42:11] reclaiming it so but you see what this
[42:13] these seals take us into eternity every
[42:16] seal we talk about the first seal what's
[42:19] one true Living God that come from
[42:20] eternity it didn't come from a man right
[42:23] one God came from eternity that's right
[42:25] that's what I'm telling you when we
[42:26] start when I try to bring this about
[42:28] Dimensions you don't get a revelation in
[42:30] this in this Dimension this Dimension is
[42:33] like brother Harris he many times he
[42:34] preached on this being not so and I
[42:36] understand now this is not so this is
[42:38] not so right if God saw listen if God
[42:40] saw us right here today even born again
[42:42] he have destroy your flesh okay that's
[42:46] what brother Brown said but what covers
[42:49] Us that red blood covers everybody why
[42:53] don't he destroy the sinner the red
[42:55] blood's covering the Earth right
[42:57] remember brother Brown said he don't
[42:59] even see you he hears your voice calling
[43:03] up through the
[43:04] blood you see what I'm talking about so
[43:07] we truly are in a Time trap Dimension
[43:10] that's right that we can't get out of in
[43:12] human flesh but we're fixing to amen
[43:15] we're fixing to break that
[43:16] law you know man says laws are made to
[43:20] be broken I think they are some of them
[43:21] that are made to be broken my um we'll
[43:24] go right here my mayor we were sitting
[43:26] down talking the other day and he was
[43:27] talking about um people dying and he he
[43:31] quoted that scripture good old Baptist
[43:32] man he said you know the Bible says it's
[43:34] appointed under man wants to die I said
[43:36] you know what I said that's an
[43:37] appointment I said if you go to the
[43:39] doctor you have a why you have an
[43:40] appointment he makes you an appointment
[43:42] says you got to come at 9:00 right do
[43:44] you have to go no no no you don't so I
[43:48] just looked at him and I said I'm going
[43:50] to miss my
[43:52] appointment all right let's go I going
[43:54] to mess my point he said you know I
[43:56] never thought of it that way
[43:59] my
[44:03] boy that blood
[44:13] yeah man I got to do my own job got do
[44:15] my own job
