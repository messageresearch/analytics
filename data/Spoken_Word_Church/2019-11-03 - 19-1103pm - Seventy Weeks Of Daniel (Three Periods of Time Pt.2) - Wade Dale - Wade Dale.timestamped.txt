[28:00] here to do our watch night service and
[28:02] that will be on the 31st of December so
[28:05] just kind of give you that for the rest
[28:07] of the year going up I went and posted
[28:09] it back there on the calendar on the
[28:12] wall and brother Joe's gonna put it on
[28:15] our website so that's kind of what's
[28:17] going on for the next month or so so
[28:20] let's begin and try to maybe I'm not
[28:23] gonna finish it today because what I
[28:25] want to do is is I want to finish the
[28:29] chart of the three periods this will be
[28:32] three period part three periods part two
[28:34] but what I'm going to do is the next
[28:36] time we preach which is going to be in
[28:39] somewhere in November or December
[28:41] because I just read you all the other
[28:43] ones maybe it's December I mean November
[28:45] there's something I want to take and and
[28:49] the contention in the message and the
[28:51] people are is there's two schools of
[28:54] thought whether there's one year left
[28:55] after the rapture or three and a half
[28:57] years and they take it by quotes because
[28:59] we have been here long enough to know I
[29:02] read you the Bible there's one week left
[29:05] after the rapture so there's no I don't
[29:07] need a quote for that I just need Bible
[29:09] but you got to make the quote match the
[29:12] Bible and we can make the quote match
[29:14] the Bible if you listen to what brother
[29:16] Branham saying he didn't change his
[29:19] doctrine at all
[29:21] he said what he meant and he meant what
[29:24] he said all right so there is no
[29:27] contention in this church but there is
[29:30] contention and other people and this is
[29:32] like brother Brown said one day he said
[29:33] I'm not here to bring a new doctrine he
[29:36] said I'm here to straighten out the
[29:37] doctrine all right straighten out a
[29:38] doctrine that has been many they've been
[29:41] contested many times in ministers
[29:43] meetings and bike even when brother Dale
[29:45] was going to ministers meetings up until
[29:47] just a few years ago so we're going to
[29:49] go through though and prove it by the
[29:51] Bible I believe we have but today we're
[29:53] going to go through the three periods
[29:55] according to Scripture and place it in
[29:57] the Word of God and then the last thing
[30:00] I'll do is a couple of Sundays from now
[30:02] I'll bring those quotes that seems I
[30:04] said seem to be contrary and the quotes
[30:09] that we that that are that I'm going to
[30:11] read to you today is that okay so that's
[30:14] why it's there is some quotes from the
[30:17] prophet of God that seems like he's
[30:20] saying two different things but he's not
[30:22] he cannot listen one more time he cannot
[30:24] say what the Bible doesn't say he can't
[30:27] make his own Bible we can't make our own
[30:29] Bible god forbid we we know he was a
[30:32] word prophet so everything what he said
[30:35] had to fit in the Word of God
[30:36] alright so because remember as I've been
[30:38] reading to you face final resting places
[30:40] where in the Word of God all right so
[30:44] face final resting place is in the Word
[30:46] of God so may the Lord help us today in
[30:48] let's bow our heads and ask you okay now
[30:51] really we good okay stop me if I sure
[30:54] enough if I get too fast okay all right
[30:57] Daniel 9:24 let's pray Heavenly Father
[31:00] thank you today for a Time Lord that
[31:03] we've set aside that we can talk about
[31:05] you just a little while
[31:06] we know the cares of life and the things
[31:09] of the world are are bombarding us on
[31:12] every hand we we we don't have time
[31:14] hardly for anything but Lord at least
[31:16] this one time we can sit here and we can
[31:19] hear from you Lord and strengthen our
[31:22] bodies Lord in and keep us strong Lord
[31:25] and keep us tentative where we can can
[31:27] hear from you Father may it not that
[31:29] they hear from brother Wei today Lord

[31:39] it won't be wrong you're the one to be
[31:41] the revealing which you'll never be
[31:43] wrong if it comes from You Father we
[31:45] pray this should be with the ones that
[31:46] are not here today Lord ones on the
[31:48] highway the ones that are sick the ones
[31:52] that are sin stick Lord we pray this you
[31:53] just touch them now Lord many people in
[31:56] this congregation Lord got loved ones
[32:00] and husbands wives daughters sons that
[32:04] are not serving you Lord we prayed today
[32:05] that you'll touch their heart Lord it's
[32:09] getting to be a Time Lord where we truly
[32:11] don't need to be playing around Lord we
[32:13] need to be earnestly earnestly earnestly
[32:17] praying for the ones Lord that are that
[32:19] we want to come in father
[32:21] we pray that you'd bless brother Russ
[32:23] Lord as he goes back home tomorrow that
[32:24] you'll take care of him give him
[32:26] strength Lord give us all Lord today our
[32:30] daily bread and we're coming to a
[32:32] communion time today Lord we pray that

[32:36] and keep us Lord clean father as we were
[32:38] talking yesterday there's a daily
[32:40] cleansing Lord today washed us by the
[32:42] water of the word so that we can take
[32:45] this communion Lord and truly be a
[32:47] communion a love affair between us and
[32:50] you Lord we pray that you'd be with us
[32:52] now sanctifies Jesus name we pray amen
[32:56] Daniel 9:24 says seventy weeks are
[32:58] determined upon thy people and who is
[33:00] that Israel or the Jews and upon the
[33:03] holy city which is Jerusalem to do six
[33:07] things to finish the transgression to
[33:09] make an end of sins to make
[33:12] reconciliation for iniquity to bring in
[33:15] everlasting righteousness to seal up the
[33:17] vision and prophecy and to anoint the
[33:19] most holy
[33:20] know therefore now look know therefore
[33:23] so you say you got to know this know
[33:26] therefore and understand that from the
[33:27] going forth of the commandment to
[33:29] restore and to build Jerusalem unto
[33:31] messiah the prince which is who jesus
[33:34] christ shall be seven weeks
[33:37] that's one period and threescore in two
[33:40] weeks that's the second period the
[33:42] street shall be built again the wall
[33:44] even in troublous times and we're going
[33:46] to read that in the scripture today out
[33:47] of Nehemiah and
[33:48] after that word after I'm going to show
[33:52] you how close that is and the Prophet
[33:55] brings it right straight down and after
[33:57] threescore in two weeks shall Messiah be
[33:59] cut off but not for himself who was he
[34:02] cut off for us and the people of the
[34:04] prince that shall come now who is that
[34:06] Titus shall destroy the city in the
[34:09] sanctuary
[34:10] because in AD 70 Titus drove rode into
[34:13] Jerusalem and destroyed the city and
[34:15] took all the menorah and he took the
[34:17] holiest of holies and all the different
[34:18] things took him back to what Rome
[34:21] because he was a Roman general and
[34:24] that's where you're gonna get the
[34:25] building of the sanctuary here a little
[34:26] bit later the physical one and the end
[34:29] thereof shall be with a flood and to the
[34:31] end of the war desolations are
[34:33] determined and he shall confirm who's
[34:35] that he'd that's not Christ because he's
[34:38] going to break the Covenant Christ
[34:39] doesn't break a covenant that's the
[34:41] Antichrist and he shall make a covenant
[34:44] with many for one week that's your third
[34:47] period and in the midst of the week
[34:50] what's in the middle of seven three and
[34:51] a half he shall cause the sacrifice and
[34:54] the oblation to cease and for the
[34:57] overspreading of abominations he shall
[34:58] make it desolate even unto the
[35:01] consummation and that determined shall
[35:02] be poured upon the desolate you may be
[35:05] seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[35:07] the reading of the word I'm going to
[35:09] read you a few quotes if you'll pull up
[35:10] we're going to read probably one in two
[35:12] and in the Book of Revelations we're
[35:14] going to go in into the Bible here but I
[35:17] first quote is from brother Branham a
[35:19] six fold purposes seventy weeks are
[35:20] determined upon thy people
[35:22] for what purpose for what whose people
[35:25] was it determined upon now remember it's
[35:27] not to us Gentiles but I do want to show
[35:30] you one thing that the way God does
[35:32] things he does in continuity and we're
[35:35] going to be able to see that that he
[35:37] does he can't do anything different than
[35:39] what he's already said in his word he
[35:42] can't change it
[35:43] he can't even modify it it's ever done
[35:47] it's ever unchangeable alright so who is
[35:50] it to Daniel's people the Jews and what
[35:54] was it determined for upon not only
[35:56] Daniel but upon Daniel's holy city like
[36:00] I said before that's your key there's
[36:01] two things
[36:02] got to be restored because what are we
[36:04] talking about in Daniel 70 weeks we're
[36:08] talking about redemption our restoration
[36:11] to restore all things back to its
[36:14] rightful position so Daniels Holy City
[36:17] now class what was Daniel's holy city
[36:19] Jerusalem all right now let's go to
[36:22] quote number two we've read these before
[36:23] just want to kind of help our ones that
[36:27] haven't been here these 70 weeks of
[36:32] Daniel just read the read these 70 weeks
[36:34] of Daniel covers from the going up of
[36:37] the church until the coming back of the
[36:39] church and that space is what it covers
[36:41] now not all 70 weeks of Daniel part of
[36:43] it he's talking about the six fold
[36:45] purpose now listen remember we leave
[36:49] this place according to revelations four
[36:52] we go in a rapture revelations for one
[36:56] John is sees an open door and says
[37:00] there's there's a voice that's come up
[37:02] hither
[37:03] so in Revelations for one we go in the
[37:05] rapture that's after the church ages are
[37:07] over we go in a rapture there ma'am and
[37:10] we're not seen again until revelations
[37:13] 1921 when we the wife has made herself
[37:17] ready us and Christ ride back into this
[37:20] millennium and then alright so what goes
[37:26] on right here is to the Jews now what
[37:29] back here is has to set it up to where
[37:31] you come to this last week that we're
[37:34] going to talk about in just a second
[37:35] alright we'll take the first period and
[37:37] walk our way through it and make sure
[37:40] everything's okay now look watch and
[37:43] seventy weeks are determined upon thy
[37:44] people now remember that is all that the
[37:48] journey of the Israelites will have in
[37:50] this earth they are determined seventy
[37:54] weeks is just determined that's all
[37:56] that's lauded to the Jews therefore the
[38:00] seventy weeks and I don't miss it it
[38:02] will reveal from that time to the end of
[38:05] the Jews and also to the end of
[38:07] Jerusalem all right what is the end of
[38:12] Jerusalem the Battle of Armageddon is
[38:14] going to destroy everything so that
[38:16] would be the end of Jerusalem as
[38:17] everybody got that say man all right
[38:19] until he says a new city is built and
[38:23] that will be the city in the Millennium
[38:25] according to Ezekiel 43 44 do you need
[38:29] these quotes you know you're okay you
[38:31] can see them okay
[38:32] okay God don't let me get too fast so
[38:36] now let's go to Revelations and let's
[38:38] see how this is going to happen the
[38:41] culmination is what we're looking at but
[38:43] then we're going to back up and go all
[38:44] the way back in the history I read some
[38:48] commentators online this week and of
[38:53] course they've got the same school of
[38:54] thought that a lot of people in the
[38:55] message is God they've got they've got
[38:56] one school of thought that Jesus
[38:58] fulfilled three-and-a-half of the seven
[39:02] of the last week he fulfilled it when he
[39:04] was on the earth and there's only three
[39:05] and a half years left what they've done
[39:06] is is they put this section back over
[39:08] here all right you can't do that you
[39:12] can't do that and be right you can't do
[39:14] that you can't you can't save the Jews
[39:17] over here
[39:20] the Jews get saved when we leave hey man
[39:25] that's just to me that's just plain
[39:28] Bible all right so revelations 11 verse
[39:31] 1 there was given unto me a reed a reed
[39:34] like unto a rod and the angel stood
[39:36] saying rise and measure the temple of
[39:37] God and the altar and them that worship
[39:40] therein but the court which is without
[39:42] the temple leave out and measure it not
[39:44] for it is given unto the Gentiles in the
[39:46] Holy City shall they tread under foot
[39:48] forty and two months
[39:51] everybody got that that's what the Bible
[39:54] says and I will give power unto my two
[39:57] witnesses now who is that according to
[39:59] the Bible who is that Moses and Elijah
[40:02] the spirit of Moses and the spirit of
[40:05] Elijah on to Jews that are going to be
[40:09] the two witnesses and they're going to
[40:11] prophesy one thousand two hundred and
[40:15] threescore days so 1260 days is the time
[40:19] that they're going to preach thereby got
[40:22] that same amendment right that's the
[40:25] time they're going to preach and they
[40:27] are going to preach not
[40:30] here they're gonna preach right here and
[40:33] if you've got your you got your chart
[40:35] this is the chart that brother Branham
[40:36] drew during the Daniels 70 week series
[40:39] like I said we asked George Smith which
[40:42] married sister Rebecca and Rebecca's the
[40:43] one that drew this he said yes that is
[40:46] the exact thing she drew for brother
[40:49] Branham during the time of the 70 weeks
[40:52] of Daniel so if anybody doesn't have one
[40:54] you want one anybody want one anybody
[40:58] else wants one just let me know all
[41:00] right but that's the same drawing we got
[41:02] here I just want you to think I'm not
[41:04] drawing this chart for for my purpose
[41:06] I'm doing it exactly the way brother
[41:08] Branham had it when he drew it and
[41:11] preached the three series of the seventy
[41:16] weeks of Daniel so what's going to
[41:18] happen is they're going to prophesy 1260
[41:22] days which is what exactly three and
[41:25] one-half years according to the Jewish
[41:29] counter the prophetic calendar of 360
[41:32] days to a year not 365 and a quarter
[41:35] okay
[41:37] we're going back to the prophetic
[41:38] calendar of 360 days to the year all
[41:43] right we know that according to the
[41:45] Bible we look over in Genesis 29 I
[41:48] believe it is where Jacob worked seven
[41:52] years for Leah and seven years for
[41:56] Rachel and then the Bible says he
[41:59] fulfilled her week so one week equals
[42:02] seven years
[42:03] all right there's 70 weeks of Daniel
[42:06] times seven years we are looking for a
[42:09] total of 490 years to fulfill the 70
[42:15] weeks of Daniel because the Bible says
[42:17] 70 weeks are determined I read you the
[42:20] Bible so we got to find 70 weeks are 490
[42:24] years which is 70 times 7 even the
[42:27] brother from the University of Georgia
[42:28] shouldn't know that you went to Georgia
[42:33] Tech you might not
[42:36] not to go our Florida weight out to go a
[42:39] little bit slower but that's 400 we got
[42:43] to find 490 years because 490 years
[42:45] finishes what look what I drew from the
[42:48] time on your chart to where this theme
[42:50] begins to where this thing ends it's got
[42:54] to be 490 years now you got to take out
[42:58] the engrafting of the gentile tree all
[43:05] right
[43:05] you got to take that out because they
[43:07] cut him off he turned to the Gentiles
[43:11] through Paul and Peter and all those
[43:13] different ones and this is a Gentile
[43:15] Church age this has nothing to do with
[43:18] the 490 years it's inserted in here
[43:22] because God took and divorced Israel
[43:26] can't marry her anymore so he marries a
[43:29] bride but he can't forget Israel he's
[43:33] going to take her as servants the
[43:35] 144,000 are not going to be in the
[43:37] Millennium as bride they will be in the
[43:40] Millennium as being servants to the
[43:42] bride in the temple you're going to see
[43:45] in a little while they build the temple
[43:47] we don't build temples we're there on a
[43:49] honeymoon
[43:51] why would in the world would you want to
[43:53] I mean Jen and I been married 40 years
[43:55] we may not have if Ida had her start
[43:57] building a house today after we went on
[43:59] our honeymoon
[44:02] vacation time rest we've come to our
[44:06] restaurant here when we take a rapture
[44:08] we've entered our rest actually you've
[44:10] entered it now you just got your body's
[44:13] got to catch up to it
[44:14] amen but now what's got to be redeemed
[44:17] now watch what's going to be redeemed
[44:19] for you and I brother Dale was talking
[44:22] about the whole creation groaneth in
[44:24] travail that's what for the
[44:25] manifestation of the sons of God -
[44:28] whereas brother Dale said in the
[44:30] adoption series where brother man I
[44:32] think it was where he said it takes us
[44:33] back to the Garden of Eden well now this
[44:36] is not heavens forbid this is not the
[44:39] Garden of Eden this is the garden of the
[44:41] devil this is Satan's Eden but what's it
[44:45] going to be by the transforming power
[44:47] that
[44:47] transforms you and I and changes our
[44:51] body in this dimension he's going to
[44:56] take us out of here destroy a lot of
[44:59] things during the crit tribulation and
[45:01] then the Battle of Armageddon destroys
[45:03] everything what's it going to do it's
[45:05] going to bring us back to an Eden
[45:07] condition in the Millennium alright so
[45:09] you and I but really our time is no
[45:13] longer right here and truly when you get
[45:16] born again brother man said you were
[45:18] sitting in heavenly we are sitting in
[45:19] heavenly places right now in your soul
[45:24] you're right here because you're eternal
[45:28] you have no time we have no set 490
[45:32] years and deaths and that when the when
[45:34] Christ came and put one land on one foot
[45:36] on land one for don't see any raising
[45:38] hand he said time shall be no longer now
[45:42] we look in the book of daniel about
[45:44] daniel 10 11 or 12 maybe 12 I think it
[45:46] is you see one put a foot on one one on
[45:50] the land the one on the sea he raised
[45:51] his hand he said it for a time times and
[45:53] a dividing of times so it would be for
[45:56] three and a half years to restore Israel
[46:00] to people but you got to remember the
[46:04] city also because it's determined upon
[46:07] thy people and the holy city God
[46:10] promised them a city alright our city
[46:16] like I said before our city is worth
[46:18] thousand and some odd years over here
[46:22] the future home is our city the
[46:25] Millennial temple is not our city the
[46:27] millennium is not our time cuz it's time
[46:30] we're not in time
[46:32] we're eternal people walk right back
[46:34] into time just like we left the place
[46:36] only everything is gonna be cleared off
[46:38] alright and we're gonna be there with
[46:40] 144,000 fifth sealed you ever how you
[46:43] want to put that in there but it's going
[46:45] to be a thousand years till we get to
[46:47] our home over here and that future home
[46:51] is in you according to Revelations John
[46:57] saw the bride or the city coming down
[46:59] onto the mountain
[47:00] as a bride adorned for a husband what
[47:02] was it all the bride all the bride
[47:05] coming down because remember like I've
[47:06] always said when the window you read the
[47:09] paper and it says Minneapolis all of
[47:13] Minneapolis came out for this parade
[47:16] well all the all the buildings didn't
[47:20] hop out to the end of the street
[47:21] it was the people the people of
[47:24] Minnesota the whole city of Minnesota
[47:27] came out Minnesota came out to see the
[47:32] parade will you would think man all the
[47:34] buildings and no it's not the buildings
[47:36] it's the people it's the people so you
[47:40] and I were the people of the city we are
[47:42] the city you can't separate them okay
[47:45] well now let's get to them because
[47:46] you're gonna do the same thing with the
[47:48] Jews I'm gonna want to bring you a
[47:49] little something that the Lord showed me
[47:50] yesterday that it helped me out a lot
[47:53] even more so now the two witnesses going
[47:57] to prophesy now they listen let's let's
[48:01] do the let's deduct this thing keeps
[48:04] moving when when to the two witnesses
[48:08] show up not when we're here right so
[48:13] it's got to be if we're gonna take
[48:15] rapture it's got to be over here
[48:17] somewhere they didn't show up here to do
[48:21] 1260 days they're gonna show up over
[48:23] here somewhere
[48:24] because the two witnesses are to the
[48:26] Jews only not to us
[48:29] everybody all right with that say man
[48:31] all right so they gotta show up over
[48:33] here so the 1260 days is gonna happen
[48:35] after the rapture but we've got some
[48:39] other things to take care of we got the
[48:41] three periods now what's going to happen
[48:43] is when the two witnesses come on earth
[48:46] they're gonna preach they're gonna open
[48:48] the seals they are the sixth seal the
[48:50] prophet of God said they what they speak
[48:53] in nature does exactly what they tell it
[48:56] to do what it's getting ready for us to
[48:58] come back because you know what we got
[49:00] into speaking condition right here hey
[49:03] man we got into speaking condition here
[49:05] because you're gonna have to speak your
[49:07] body change a man said you got to come
[49:09] in speaking condition right here
[49:11] and then what comes off of us is just
[49:14] going to go over to the two witnesses
[49:16] and they're going to come into speaking
[49:18] condition all right and they're going to
[49:20] what rain fire do all these different
[49:22] things for 1260 days then the Bible says
[49:25] they will be killed in Revelations 11
[49:27] they're going to be killed laying the
[49:29] streets for three and a half days all
[49:30] the world's going to see them they're
[49:32] going to just fall in love with each
[49:33] other because they've killed these two
[49:34] people that have just destroyed the
[49:37] earth then what's going to happen
[49:40] God's gonna resurrect them and send them
[49:42] in a rapture okay all right when he
[49:46] sends him in a rapture what's gonna
[49:48] happen the Battle of Armageddon will
[49:49] begin and destroy everything on the
[49:52] earth by an atomic battle it's not gonna
[49:55] be a battle of God against no it's like
[49:58] brother Dale says he's looking for a
[49:59] battle there's Protestants and Catholics
[50:01] that's what it's going to be it's going
[50:02] to be the two factions that turns
[50:05] against each other and you got Israel
[50:07] there in the middle and they're gonna be
[50:09] everybody's just going to start punching
[50:10] buttons and this is going to be chaos
[50:11] but we're gonna be up here somewhere in
[50:13] another dimension it's not gonna bother
[50:14] us not going to buy the 144,000 and the
[50:17] two witnesses the only thing that's
[50:20] going to be destroyed from here to here
[50:21] is going to be the land and all the evil
[50:23] people that are here they're by alright
[50:25] with that saying ma'am
[50:26] alright so now you got that so we looked
[50:31] at the six fold purpose that's the first
[50:32] thing we covered I told you if you
[50:34] understand the six fold purpose you'd
[50:36] understand Daniel 7 two weeks because
[50:38] what happens with a six fold purpose
[50:40] seventy weeks are determined to do six
[50:42] things finish the transgression make an
[50:45] end of sin make reconciliation for
[50:47] iniquity that's people not buildings
[50:50] that's people you don't redeem buildings
[50:54] you redeem people all right but now the
[50:58] other three is to bring in everlasting
[51:00] righteousness seal up the vision and
[51:03] prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[51:05] so you can't do all six right here they
[51:08] can't be three and a half years left
[51:09] after the rapture that has to be one
[51:11] week according to the Bible to fulfill
[51:13] all that we've been talking about
[51:15] alright because what's going to happen
[51:17] let's read this one quote let's skip
[51:19] over through all we did all this back
[51:22] several months ago or a month ago on a
[51:24] watch let's read number three
[51:26] the 70th week of Daniel prophet of God
[51:29] preached this is the last in the series
[51:31] he said now the six full purpose we find
[51:34] out that on this sixth purpose I'm going
[51:36] to skip to number six because it should
[51:38] be right over here
[51:39] alright the sixth full purpose we find
[51:42] out that most holy always represented
[51:45] the church now who's the church we're
[51:47] the church with a bride not 144,000 with
[51:53] a bride we're the ones that went
[51:55] somewhere right and we're coming back in
[51:58] revelations 19 21 to somewhere to the
[52:02] earth everybody alright with that say
[52:03] ma'am
[52:04] alright so now look always represented
[52:07] the church the tabernacle and the last
[52:10] thing was to be done was to anoint the
[52:12] most holy
[52:13] that's the Millennial tabernacle that
[52:16] he'll live in during the Millennial that
[52:19] will live in that we will live in
[52:23] because we're gonna they're gonna build
[52:25] it and we're gonna live in it now they
[52:27] can't build it over here because it's
[52:29] gonna get straw and destroyed in the
[52:30] Battle of Armageddon it's gotta be built
[52:33] here at the end of the 70th week and
[52:36] then it rock just rolls right over into
[52:38] the Millennium everybody alright with
[52:40] that I'm just reading what brother
[52:41] Branham said all right and according to
[52:44] the Bible there's one week left after
[52:46] the rapture all right
[52:47] so let's read that let's look at your
[52:49] three periods of time like we did the
[52:51] other day and then let's set them in
[52:53] order according to the Bible everybody
[52:56] all right okay all right here we go
[52:58] three periods of time Daniel 9:24 says
[53:02] seventy weeks are determined the red
[53:04] know therefore and understand that from
[53:06] the going forth of the commandment to
[53:08] restore and build Jerusalem that's when
[53:11] it begins right here unto messiah the
[53:14] prince which is jesus christ there's the
[53:17] cross a t30 watch to build jerusalem
[53:23] unto messiah the prince shall be seven
[53:25] weeks and threescore in two weeks the
[53:29] street shall be built and the wall even
[53:32] in troublous times now let's stop right
[53:36] there because I'll read the rest later
[53:37] on let's go to
[53:38] before now let's outlined Daniel seventy
[53:41] of weeks now I might repeat here again
[53:44] ministers of the gospel if you disagree
[53:45] with this all right they have been for
[53:47] fifty years
[53:48] they are divided into three periods as
[53:51] we find out in Daniel 9 three periods
[53:54] first a seven week period right here
[53:58] look and you look on your chart a seven
[54:01] week period then eight three scouring to
[54:04] watch threescore 60 thirty times two
[54:09] sixty-two weeks got it which is
[54:14] sixty-two and then a one-week period
[54:17] they're divided in three different
[54:20] periods now I've got it divided here on
[54:23] the board the first period I'm sure he's
[54:24] pointing here the second he's pointing
[54:26] here and to my understanding by the
[54:28] gospel by the Holy Spirit that the end
[54:31] time God returns again to the Jew there
[54:34] buddy got that say man that's to me
[54:36] that's just pretty black and white and
[54:38] simple alright it's written in black and
[54:40] white and red all right so now let's
[54:42] look at number five just want to make
[54:44] sure you know that brother Branham said
[54:46] we know now that each week meant seven
[54:50] years have you got it let's say it
[54:51] together what those of you that are
[54:54] asleep
[54:56] one week equals seven years now we know
[55:02] we got it
[55:03] one week equals seven years all right
[55:06] now brother BAM look says here we are
[55:08] right here first week brother Brown

[56:31] alright number seven we'll get into this
[56:34] now this is in the 70th week now you see
[56:37] that brother Brahim didn't preach the
[56:38] seventy weeks of Daniel he preached the
[56:40] 70th week so he's going to preach the
[56:42] 70th week so there must be one week
[56:44] anyway just it's just really simple if
[56:49] you look at it and forget what you've
[56:52] been taught because if it ain't
[56:55] according to the Bible Nate right hello
[56:59] according to benefits according the
[57:01] Bible whatever you believe this country
[57:03] to that's not right brother Brown said
[57:05] either one's wrong and one's right both
[57:07] can't be right okay or both can be wrong
[57:10] now we are told from the going forth of
[57:12] commandant now watch we're gonna get
[57:14] started now here's where the trouble is
[57:17] in other words you said now we are told
[57:19] from the going forth of the commandment
[57:20] to rebuild the city to Messiah and
[57:23] Messiah was Christ shall be seven weeks
[57:25] now he's fixing to start right here so
[57:28] works where we're gonna start today and
[57:29] seven times sixty-nine makes four
[57:32] hundred and eighty three years now we
[57:34] got to find 490 right shake your head
[57:39] yes
[57:39] some of you were already shaking your
[57:41] head it's just not coming back up again
[57:46] the only decent Chili Peppers or
[57:49] something four hundred eighty three
[57:51] years we found that 62 and seven is what
[57:54] 69 69 times seventy is what four hundred
[57:59] and eighty three or four seven is 483
[58:02] years everybody got that
[58:05] pretty simple and seven times sixty-nine
[58:10] makes 483 years now you gettin it down
[58:12] if you want me to run over it again I'll
[58:14] be glad to do it now we are told from
[58:16] the going forth of commitment to rebuild
[58:18] the city of Macomb massage she'll be
[58:19] seven he's quoting scripture 7 that's
[58:22] the first right here 7 times 7 is 49
[58:26] years everybody got that seven weeks and
[58:30] threescore and two mate 62 and seven and
[58:32] 69 so right there we're right here
[58:35] everybody got that seven times 69 is 483
[58:41] years therefore until the Messiah now
[58:44] we're coming to this part here until
[58:46] them aside this is at Calvary right here
[58:48] there's got to be 483 years all right
[58:51] let's continue with quote number eight
[58:54] the message you see this morning it's
[58:57] drawn out here on the blackboard here
[58:59] it's just merely to mate to explain as I
[59:02] go along to try and make that you might
[59:04] understand what I'm trying to speak of
[59:06] so if this is what he had on the board
[59:08] this is what he used okay and this 70
[59:14] weeks of Daniel has been one great study
[59:16] two days and two nights almost I've been
[59:18] since the end of the week here I've been
[59:20] on it trying to find out what words to
[59:22] say for truth look it's got to compare
[59:25] with the rest of the Bible see you just
[59:29] can't take it just one little scripture
[59:30] and make an understanding then say well
[59:33] this is what this and then turn around
[59:35] say well but over here it says something
[59:37] else contradicts that it can't do that
[59:39] it's got to say the same thing all the
[59:42] time if you don't want then you're
[59:44] you're wrong and that's the way I've
[59:46] tried to teach it that's the way we've
[59:50] tried to teach it here now let's just
[59:52] read number nine oh what a lesson I said
[59:56] to my wife the other day I wonder if the
[59:59] people are really getting it now I want
[1:00:02] you to get it see he's not wanting to
[1:00:04] make it a complete mystery you want you
[1:00:05] to get it if you have to stay here all
[1:00:08] day long just stay now we want to get it
[1:00:12] some of you may not want to get it he
[1:00:16] wants to get it he wants you to get it
[1:00:18] we want to know that it's truth and you
[1:00:21] if you can just only see it and I ask
[1:00:23] maybe then afterwards I'm gonna leave
[1:00:26] the chart hang here and you can draw it
[1:00:28] out and that's what Becky did she drew
[1:00:29] it out and put it on a memo graph paper
[1:00:32] come in here this afternoon whenever you
[1:00:34] want to and draw it out the charts and
[1:00:36] so forth it'll help you to understand
[1:00:38] that's the reason I put it there so that
[1:00:41] you would understand it thereby alright
[1:00:44] with that
[1:00:45] it's your profit telling you you need to
[1:00:47] understand it and he's gonna give you a
[1:00:49] chart to understand it alright let's go
[1:00:51] now to Daniel 9:25 now we've done read
[1:00:54] nine Daniel 9:24 9:25 know therefore and
[1:00:59] understand that from the going forth of
[1:01:01] the commandment to restore and to build
[1:01:04] Jerusalem now what happened is is back
[1:01:08] in this period of time when Daniel was
[1:01:11] in captivity all of Jerusalem laid waste
[1:01:16] temple was gone they knocked the walls
[1:01:19] down
[1:01:20] they destroyed Jerusalem that's why the
[1:01:23] captivity was seventy years but it
[1:01:25] happened back over here the literal 70
[1:01:28] years everybody got that we already went
[1:01:29] through that all right but we've come up
[1:01:33] to a time now to where Daniel is know
[1:01:35] therefore and understand that from the
[1:01:37] going forth of the commandment to what
[1:01:38] rebuild so Jerusalem laid waste over
[1:01:41] here so what what the people what Israel
[1:01:45] wants to do if you'll even remember in
[1:01:49] Esther of the book of Esther they were
[1:01:52] under the dispersal at that time they
[1:01:55] were scattered everywhere but they
[1:01:57] wanted to come back together now see how
[1:01:59] this is one of the Lord was yesterday he
[1:02:02] brought them people back together to
[1:02:05] build a temple under Nehemiah and Ezra
[1:02:08] two prophets to build what's he gonna do
[1:02:10] here he gonna do the same thing he's
[1:02:13] gonna bring two prophets right here but
[1:02:15] you know what happened we had two
[1:02:18] prophets o Paul and brother Branham
[1:02:26] we had two prophets Paul the Alpha and
[1:02:30] Omega that doesn't do away with these
[1:02:32] people brother Brown called them
[1:02:33] prophets but remember Luther and Wesley
[1:02:35] were not word prophets like brother
[1:02:37] Branham and Paul were they were
[1:02:40] reformers and men but Paul was not a
[1:02:43] reformer Paul was what bringing them out
[1:02:45] of Pentecost bringing them into the new
[1:02:47] age of the Gentiles and then brother
[1:02:51] Branham finishes it up the two prophets
[1:02:53] to the Gentiles that what now what
[1:02:54] happens when they come together because
[1:02:56] remember brother Brown said I preached
[1:02:58] what Paul preached right eivol Reese
[1:03:01] what Paul preached and I say plus but
[1:03:04] what happened he brings Christ on the
[1:03:07] scene what happens to these two
[1:03:08] witnesses when they get finished with
[1:03:10] their 1260 days they bring Christ on the
[1:03:13] scene they bring a rapture these two
[1:03:16] prophets brought a rapture when Christ
[1:03:20] come on the scene he went in a rapture
[1:03:22] amen so it just kind of all it all fits
[1:03:25] the way God brought everything together
[1:03:26] you said all the Jews are different not
[1:03:28] exactly because Redemption is not
[1:03:31] replacement Redemption is taking what
[1:03:33] was that had failed and bringing it back
[1:03:35] to the same place all right so he's got
[1:03:38] to do the same thing with us to bring us
[1:03:40] back to the Eden Lake condition so know
[1:03:43] therefore and understand that from the
[1:03:45] going forth of the commandment to
[1:03:46] restore and to build Jerusalem unto
[1:03:49] messiah the prince right here shall be
[1:03:54] seven weeks and threescore and two weeks
[1:03:56] the street shall be built again and the
[1:03:59] wall this is the key because it took him
[1:04:05] a long time to build everything because
[1:04:09] what we're going to read in a minute is
[1:04:12] when Jesus was here and he said there
[1:04:15] won't be one stone left on another the
[1:04:16] the Pharisees looked at him and said
[1:04:20] that building was 46 years building that
[1:04:23] temple they were correct the walls
[1:04:27] weren't built though the walls and the
[1:04:30] streets were not built and listened all
[1:04:32] commentary will tell you that a that a
[1:04:37] nation is not a nation I mean
[1:04:39] in other words they wanted to build a
[1:04:42] temple well you could have built it out
[1:04:43] in the middle of the wilderness but that
[1:04:45] would have been their city of civil
[1:04:46] government you have to have a wall for
[1:04:49] what defense and you have to have the
[1:04:52] streets to what get around on so to make
[1:04:55] a city it's not just the temple it was
[1:04:58] the temple and the walls in the streets
[1:05:00] cuz that's what the Bible says shall be
[1:05:02] built again the wall even in troublous
[1:05:03] times and we'll read that now in just a
[1:05:05] minute now let's read number 10 we okay
[1:05:09] Louise okay now I've got some writing
[1:05:14] here that I'd like to read as we go I
[1:05:17] want to show we're gonna look around
[1:05:18] here and see I always wondered how
[1:05:20] brother Branham picked March to 14th 445
[1:05:25] BC now short tinea second now the going
[1:05:28] forth of the commandment to rebuild
[1:05:29] Jerusalem which was on the fourteenth
[1:05:31] day of March that's pretty precise you
[1:05:34] really can't find that in history you
[1:05:37] can't find that in the Bible but it's
[1:05:39] written in the Bible it's written right
[1:05:41] there in the Bible
[1:05:42] you just gotta know what you lookin for
[1:05:44] and I did until I actually had to read
[1:05:46] another commentary to see what it was so
[1:05:48] uh yeah yeah I read another commentary
[1:05:51] from somebody else if any of you want to
[1:05:54] put that down in the Hebrew you'll find
[1:05:56] it called in Isan Nissen is their first
[1:06:00] month of their year it is March April
[1:06:05] it's not exactly March and exactly April
[1:06:08] its March April rustle everybody studies
[1:06:11] it knows that's the first month of their
[1:06:14] year now it's not the first month of
[1:06:16] their civil year their civil calendar
[1:06:17] starts in October we went through that
[1:06:20] downstairs I don't have time to go could
[1:06:22] up here but it's on youtube if you want
[1:06:25] to watch it but look you'll find which
[1:06:28] means March the issue was given on the
[1:06:31] 14th day of March how do you find it the
[1:06:33] 14th day of March I'll show you this you
[1:06:36] went forth to build rebuild the temple
[1:06:39] you understand it as you people have
[1:06:41] read the scripture them so it must be in
[1:06:44] Scripture until it was completed it - 49
[1:06:48] years to complete the temple and
[1:06:52] the city to rebuild it and as the Bible
[1:06:56] said here Daniel speaking or the angel
[1:06:58] to Daniel that the walls it would be
[1:07:00] built in trouble as times trouble
[1:07:02] sometimes and many of us remember when
[1:07:04] it was built they had a mortar block in
[1:07:06] one hand and a sword in the other hand
[1:07:07] to watch for the enemy and it would be
[1:07:09] built in trouble as times now let's go
[1:07:12] to Nehemiah 1 now what happens is if
[1:07:14] you'll read and Ezra the book of Ezra
[1:07:17] and by awake the book of Ezra Ezra gets
[1:07:23] this function to rebuild everything but
[1:07:28] he doesn't go through with it
[1:07:30] Bible tells you if you read the book of
[1:07:32] Ezra it's that dormant that's what
[1:07:35] they've done is they went started a
[1:07:36] little while and equip because Nehemiah
[1:07:40] this is how perfect God is if Ezra would
[1:07:43] have started it it would have been
[1:07:44] starting in like 450 something BC which
[1:07:48] wouldn't fit with Daniel 70 weeks they
[1:07:51] had to start in BC 445 to start building
[1:07:55] the temple to get all your dates right
[1:07:59] so Ezra if you read an Israel you can't
[1:08:02] start with Ezra because it won't work
[1:08:04] out but look let's go to Nehemiah 1 we
[1:08:07] got it up here so you don't have to go
[1:08:08] through the through the Bible just read
[1:08:10] it right here the words of Nehemiah the
[1:08:13] son of hatch Aliyah and he came to pass
[1:08:15] in two months just learn the 20th year
[1:08:17] as I was in Shushan the palace that
[1:08:20] Hannah and I one of my brethren came and
[1:08:22] he and certain men of Judah and I asked
[1:08:25] them concerning the Jews that had
[1:08:26] escaped because remember this they had
[1:08:28] dispersed which were left of the
[1:08:30] captivity and concerning Jerusalem and
[1:08:33] they said unto me the remnant that are
[1:08:37] left of the captivity there in the
[1:08:39] province are in great affliction and
[1:08:41] reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is
[1:08:45] broken down and the gates were burned
[1:08:47] with fire so in other words it was laid
[1:08:50] waste so Nehemiah and Nehemiah let's go
[1:08:54] to Nehemiah chapter 2 now you can you
[1:08:56] can read on through I skip through this
[1:08:57] for some time near my to verse 1 now
[1:09:01] what happened and what who was near my
[1:09:03] little history here Nehemiah was the
[1:09:05] bear for King Cyrus or whichever King it
[1:09:08] was okay
[1:09:08] he was the cut' bear he was the one that
[1:09:10] gave the King wine he was so important
[1:09:15] he was he was one that the King trusted
[1:09:19] when he brought in the wine and he
[1:09:21] listened to what the King listened to
[1:09:23] what name I said because what happens is
[1:09:26] watch this this just to verse one and it
[1:09:30] came to pass in the month listen so
[1:09:32] we're in March okay we're in March he
[1:09:36] said hi brother I'm get March 14th
[1:09:38] fixing the prove it to you right here in
[1:09:40] the 20th year of our desert seize the
[1:09:43] king that wine was before him now you
[1:09:46] got to go back into history wine was
[1:09:49] only presented to the king on Passover
[1:09:54] and Passover is the 14th day after the
[1:10:01] first of the month
[1:10:06] yeah that was one of those Google
[1:10:10] moments that wine he never served him
[1:10:15] wine until that day of every year he
[1:10:20] would serve him wine and that's where
[1:10:22] you come up with because remember you
[1:10:24] got to go back to the Passover God tells
[1:10:27] them he says you take the lamb and put
[1:10:29] it up on the what the tenth day of the
[1:10:31] first month then you keep it up for four
[1:10:33] days and then on the 14th day you killed
[1:10:37] the lamb so brother Branham goes right
[1:10:40] here and says okay this happened on
[1:10:43] March the 14th 445 BC because that's
[1:10:48] what the Bible says and he gave it to
[1:10:51] the king now I had not been before times
[1:10:53] sad in his presence so Nehemiah was sad
[1:10:57] why was he sad listen wherefore the king
[1:11:01] said unto me why is thy countenance sad
[1:11:03] seeing thou art not sick this is nothing
[1:11:06] else but sorrow of heart then I was very
[1:11:10] sore afraid
[1:11:10] and so unto the king and said unto the
[1:11:13] king let the king live forever
[1:11:17] I should not my countenance be sad when
[1:11:20] my City the place of my father Sepulchre
[1:11:24] life waste and the gates thereof are
[1:11:28] consumed with fire so to make a long
[1:11:31] story short let's go to near my 4:17 in
[1:11:36] other words the king is fixing to given
[1:11:37] an edict or a what he's doing is he said
[1:11:41] okay I'm giving you permission because
[1:11:43] what he's got to do is they're not in
[1:11:45] Jerusalem okay they're not in Jerusalem
[1:11:49] at that time they're in Shushan the
[1:11:50] palace artaxerxes Medes and Persians but
[1:11:55] Nehemiah's going to have to go to
[1:11:57] Jerusalem to build it well he's got to
[1:11:58] go through all these countries that hate
[1:12:00] them and he's got to have something in
[1:12:02] his hand that said hey the King told me
[1:12:04] I could come and do this and that's what
[1:12:06] this is they which build on the wall and
[1:12:09] they that bear burdens with those that
[1:12:10] later than everyone with those hands rot
[1:12:12] in the work when the other hand held a
[1:12:15] weapon now what did they say in Daniel 9
[1:12:18] that the wall shall be built even in
[1:12:21] troublous times for the builders
[1:12:23] everyone that had his sword on his side
[1:12:25] and so build it in other words sort in
[1:12:28] one hand trial in another hand and why
[1:12:31] did that happen if you'll continue and
[1:12:34] read near mine for 1517 down through
[1:12:39] there what happened the other kingdoms
[1:12:44] didn't want them to build back because
[1:12:46] they knew that they had a God then there
[1:12:50] was some history they had a god that
[1:12:53] answered their prayer and they had a god
[1:12:55] that said if you'll just turn to the
[1:12:57] palace or turn to the temple I'll hear
[1:13:00] your cry so that you know what nobody
[1:13:02] else wanted them to build it why do you
[1:13:05] think they're trying to kill them now
[1:13:06] see that same devil was right here today
[1:13:08] trying to disperse the Jews again
[1:13:10] because they know if the Jews get
[1:13:13] everything right God's got to come to
[1:13:14] them same way back then in near my 4
[1:13:17] verse 15 watch and it came to pass when
[1:13:20] our enemies heard that it was known unto
[1:13:22] us and God had brought their counsel -
[1:13:24] not that we returned all of us to the
[1:13:27] wall everyone or to his work
[1:13:28] and was all the Sirians and I don't know
[1:13:31] what their name was in but what happened
[1:13:32] was they try to get in there when at
[1:13:35] night or whatever and they try to tear
[1:13:36] the wall down they've built it all dam
[1:13:38] built it all day and then here comes the
[1:13:40] enemy and tear the wall down at night
[1:13:42] so anyway Nehemiah said hold on a minute
[1:13:44] and it came to pass from that time forth
[1:13:47] half of my servants we're working in the
[1:13:49] other half held spear shield and bow
[1:13:51] what happened was that army was this way
[1:13:54] looking out into the desert and the ones
[1:13:56] right here were building the wall in
[1:13:59] trouble astounds half of my servants
[1:14:04] that's why it took him longer but
[1:14:06] remember they built that wall in 52 days
[1:14:09] once they got started what a
[1:14:12] supernatural happening all right it came
[1:14:15] to pass in that time the half of my
[1:14:17] service rotting the work and the other
[1:14:18] half both spear shields and all that the
[1:14:21] ODE near my 417 and they which builded
[1:14:24] the wall and they that bear burdens with
[1:14:25] those that were laden every one one hand
[1:14:27] wrought in the work we read that and the
[1:14:29] other hand held a weapon
[1:14:30] look at verse 21 so we labored in the
[1:14:33] work just to save time
[1:14:35] so we labored in the work and half of
[1:14:36] them held a spear from the rising of the
[1:14:38] morning till the stars appeared so they
[1:14:41] built the wall in trouble as times and
[1:14:44] they built it in 49 years from the time
[1:14:49] they started BC 445 I'm not going to get
[1:14:51] into the dates they built it in 49 years
[1:14:54] they finished the wall in 52 days when
[1:14:59] they finish the wall that's when they
[1:15:01] became a civil government again all
[1:15:04] right there buddy got that so it's the
[1:15:07] wall so we remember it's got to be the
[1:15:09] city and the Jews all right let's go to
[1:15:13] the that's the first period the first
[1:15:15] period of time they built the temple and
[1:15:17] the wall in 49 years but now we got to
[1:15:21] get these sixty-two weeks or 434 more
[1:15:24] years
[1:15:24] well it's all history just keep reading
[1:15:26] in your Bible read all your history just
[1:15:29] keep continue reading now remember let
[1:15:32] me get throw this in for just a second
[1:15:33] as you read your Bible it's not in
[1:15:36] chronological or it's not in your order
[1:15:39] everybody know that if you didn't you do
[1:15:42] now
[1:15:42] it's not in your order you look if you
[1:15:44] got a Scofield Bible the dates jump
[1:15:47] around but what man did when they were
[1:15:49] putting a Bible together they're the
[1:15:50] ones that put them in these in the order
[1:15:52] they're in now but if you'll go online
[1:15:54] you can get a like a lineage from who
[1:15:59] their job supposedly is the oldest book
[1:16:01] all right
[1:16:03] Genesis is not Joby's but the writer and
[1:16:06] then if you look those times you'll see
[1:16:08] how those time Nehemiah Ezra Zachariah
[1:16:15] all these different ones were inside all
[1:16:17] this and they kind of all intertwine but
[1:16:20] if you'll read that you'll understand
[1:16:21] more of what's going on right on up to
[1:16:24] we know that Malachi was the last one
[1:16:26] and there was 400 years between Malachi
[1:16:28] which the back I came in here 400 years
[1:16:30] between Malachi and Christ okay just to
[1:16:34] give you a little history to show that
[1:16:35] but look now everybody understand the
[1:16:38] first period then Nehemiah BC 445 it's
[1:16:41] when the edict came down or the contract
[1:16:44] that Cyrus said I will protect you as
[1:16:47] much as I can you go build a city and
[1:16:49] the wall thereby understand that because
[1:16:52] you go back to the New Testament they're
[1:16:54] going to say we built the temple in 46
[1:16:56] years that's the temple not the walls in
[1:16:59] the streets because it says walls and
[1:17:01] streets even in troublous times so they
[1:17:04] built that for 49 years that's your
[1:17:06] first period we're going to talk about
[1:17:10] now the second period so let's continue
[1:17:11] on everybody okay know therefore and
[1:17:15] understand from the going forth of
[1:17:16] commandment restore and rebuild
[1:17:17] Jerusalem until my side of the Prince
[1:17:20] shall be seven weeks and threescore and
[1:17:22] two weeks the street shall be built
[1:17:23] again and the wall even in troublous
[1:17:26] times now watch here's the net here's
[1:17:27] the part we're going to talk to about
[1:17:29] and after watch this this is how
[1:17:33] specific that everybody thinks brother
[1:17:35] Brown made so many mistakes now he
[1:17:37] didn't make a few slips of the tongue
[1:17:38] cuz he said ad 33 and him in AD 30 he
[1:17:41] said four hundred and thirty-eight years
[1:17:44] instead of 483 years that's just human
[1:17:46] we got to stay with what the Bible says
[1:17:49] alright Bible says that now watch but
[1:17:53] now watch this
[1:17:54] now remember remember that date
[1:17:56] remember March 14 if I got that remember
[1:18:06] that day March 14 the day of the
[1:18:08] Passover in the month of March which now
[1:18:11] remember the first month is March April
[1:18:15] because it doesn't go March cut it off
[1:18:17] April cut it off there their calendar is
[1:18:20] different than ours everybody got that
[1:18:22] cuz Nissen is actually half of March
[1:18:25] half of April all right the brother
[1:18:28] branham brings this date in really
[1:18:29] specific because watch what's going to
[1:18:31] happen because remember the Bible says
[1:18:33] look the Bible says after threescore in
[1:18:37] two weeks all right so you got a seven
[1:18:39] week period you got a 62 week period
[1:18:43] so after 62 weeks the Messiah's going to
[1:18:47] be cut off now when was he cut off at
[1:18:49] Calvary is that right say ma'am that's
[1:18:52] when he was cut off so it says after 62
[1:18:55] weeks now a lot of people interpret that
[1:18:57] is is that now that after 62 weeks
[1:18:59] that'll bring that three and a half
[1:19:00] years in no that's not correct that's
[1:19:03] not right that's not right at all
[1:19:06] because inside this watch what's going
[1:19:08] to happen you watch our brother Ram
[1:19:09] brings these dates in watch remember
[1:19:13] March of 14th
[1:19:15] everybody got that remember that because
[1:19:19] watch this next quote now we are told
[1:19:21] from the going forth of the commandment
[1:19:23] this is virgin umber 11 now we're told
[1:19:26] from the going forth of commandment to
[1:19:27] rebuild the city to Messiah and the
[1:19:29] Messiah Christ of course shall be seven
[1:19:32] weeks and threescore and two weeks
[1:19:34] making sixty-nine weeks everybody got
[1:19:37] that
[1:19:38] sixty-two plus seven is 69 it says after
[1:19:44] 62 weeks the Messiah's gonna be cut off
[1:19:47] now where was he cut off at Calvary he
[1:19:50] was cut off now watch I want you to
[1:19:53] watch how perfect this is
[1:19:55] now you gettin it down if you want me to
[1:19:58] run over it again I'll be glad to now we
[1:20:00] are told from the going forth of the
[1:20:03] commandment to rebuild the city to
[1:20:04] massage she'll be seven seven that's
[1:20:06] first right here when he goes first
[1:20:08] right that's right here seven
[1:20:11] and three scoring to mate 62 and seven
[1:20:15] and 69 all right
[1:20:17] seven times 69 makes 483 years therefore
[1:20:22] until them assign now we're coming to
[1:20:24] this part here I believe he's pointing
[1:20:27] right there until them aside there's got
[1:20:30] to be 483 years so there's 434 and
[1:20:33] there's 49 if you add those two together
[1:20:36] you get 483 everybody got that but now
[1:20:39] watch what the Bible says says after 62
[1:20:42] weeks now after 62 weeks only Kim has
[1:20:47] gotten to be one day the day after
[1:20:50] tomorrow you got it okay so no watch
[1:20:54] watch him bring it right here now now
[1:20:56] Jesus the Messiah rode into the city of
[1:21:00] Jerusalem triumph on the back of a white
[1:21:03] mule remember on Palm Sunday now what is
[1:21:07] Palm Sunday that's the week before the
[1:21:11] resurrection has everybody got that same
[1:21:12] am that's the week before the
[1:21:16] resurrection got it
[1:21:21] April the second 80 30 Jesus rode into
[1:21:29] Jerusalem on Palm Sunday ad 30 they eat
[1:21:34] it went forth on March the 14th
[1:21:38] now April the second is a week before
[1:21:42] the resurrection so he died on Friday
[1:21:49] well actually Thursday before Friday
[1:21:52] before Saturday right he the Passover
[1:21:54] was on Saturday he died on Friday before
[1:21:58] 6 o'clock we went through this I hope
[1:22:00] maybe we'll go over it again remember
[1:22:02] Jewish Jewish days start at 6 o'clock or
[1:22:05] end at 6 o'clock in the afternoon then a
[1:22:09] new day starts that's why they had to
[1:22:11] get Christ off the cross before 6
[1:22:13] o'clock Friday afternoon to keep from
[1:22:17] going into Passover which was on their
[1:22:19] Sabbath which is on Saturday if I got
[1:22:22] that same am
[1:22:23] all right so this is April the second so
[1:22:26] what is you got March 14th and April the
[1:22:31] second he was crucified our cut off four
[1:22:36] days after that right Palm Sunday Monday
[1:22:41] Tuesday Wednesday Thursday he was cut
[1:22:45] off on April the fourth which is after
[1:22:47] March 14th March the 14th would have
[1:22:51] been here April the 4th is after the 62
[1:22:56] weeks ended but just barely by a few
[1:22:58] days you don't have to be but just might
[1:23:01] a few days for it to be after 62 weeks
[1:23:04] so you got to go by what the Bible says
[1:23:06] the Bible says after 62 weeks Messiah
[1:23:09] will be cut off so he was killed right
[1:23:11] here it would be ad 30 April he actually
[1:23:19] killed 1 April the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6 so
[1:23:25] that's after the sixty-two weeks was
[1:23:26] over the sixty-two weeks was over you
[1:23:29] bring this in and you bring the 49 and
[1:23:31] 434 years you bring it right here so
[1:23:34] after 62 weeks he was killed
[1:23:37] do you remember you remember where that
[1:23:39] is in the Bible it's in the book of John
[1:23:46] where Jesus rode into Jerusalem and it
[1:23:49] throwed the palm trees down and they
[1:23:51] said Hosanna to the king I believe that
[1:23:54] was like John 12 you'd think it would be
[1:23:56] so you see from John 12 to the end of
[1:24:01] John when he was crucified there was a
[1:24:03] bunch of chapters in there there's
[1:24:05] chapter 17 where he goes and prays will
[1:24:07] he's praying during that whole time from
[1:24:10] Palm Sunday till that Thursday he was
[1:24:12] really busy
[1:24:15] he actually preached the seals
[1:24:18] during that time Matthew 24 was all
[1:24:22] during that time leading up from April
[1:24:24] the 2nd till April the 6th when he died
[1:24:26] all right so everybody ok with that
[1:24:29] just wanted to say after 62 weeks the
[1:24:32] Messiah was cut off now watch
[1:24:34] let's read number 12
[1:24:38] and many people let's get back to this
[1:24:41] just for a minute
[1:24:42] you even look in Scofield in different
[1:24:43] ones that says ad 33 but if you go back
[1:24:46] in your history and we proved it several
[1:24:48] years ago that Jesus was born around 4
[1:24:51] BC because that's when Herod came into
[1:24:54] power then you got to take your two
[1:24:55] years whenever he said all the kids 2
[1:24:57] years and younger kill them all because
[1:24:59] he was born somewhere around then 4 BC
[1:25:02] so 4 BC to AD 30 that make him 33 years
[1:25:06] old he said there's no way you don't
[1:25:09] have a 0 year it goes 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5
[1:25:14] 6 to 30 there's not a 0 year when he
[1:25:17] went from BC to AD everybody got that so
[1:25:20] he was 33 years old we know that but he
[1:25:23] was crucified in the year AD 30 and even
[1:25:27] brother Branham in the seal book refers
[1:25:31] back to Matthew 24 and says it happened
[1:25:34] on these dates in 80 30 he said they
[1:25:39] asked you this was how specific how do
[1:25:41] you know that he was a prophet he said
[1:25:42] they asked him one one question in the
[1:25:44] morning remember then they went back and
[1:25:47] actually and the other two questions in
[1:25:48] the afternoon I God had to show him that
[1:25:50] because we weren't there and it's not in
[1:25:53] the Bible so same way with this with
[1:25:57] this March 14th it was right there in
[1:25:59] the Bible we just didn't know we had to
[1:26:00] have a prophet come and bring it to us
[1:26:02] that March the 14th was the Passover day
[1:26:04] when he gave him the wine so how
[1:26:08] interesting is that
[1:26:08] number 12 now does everybody understand
[1:26:12] up this far those of you that are awake
[1:26:18] now does everybody understand up to this
[1:26:23] farm if you don't then you know what you
[1:26:25] got to pray because I can't reveal it to
[1:26:27] you I can just show you what's going on
[1:26:28] and God's got the ability everybody
[1:26:31] understand up this far that it's
[1:26:32] perfectly the truth it's the Bible
[1:26:36] it's the prophetic years now we come up
[1:26:38] and we get them up here to the rejection
[1:26:41] of the Messiah see from to the rejection
[1:26:43] of Messiah the last week he's talking
[1:26:46] about right here because he's come up to
[1:26:48] the killing of Messiah then the last
[1:26:49] week what
[1:26:51] now I want to stop right here just a
[1:26:53] minute and explain this that when they
[1:26:55] rejected the Messiah was when they of
[1:26:57] course rejected Jesus as Savior and
[1:26:59] crucified him
[1:27:01] you remember over here when the Bible
[1:27:02] said and he shall be cut off but not for
[1:27:04] himself Messiah the Prince now think how
[1:27:06] close that prophecy hit I just showed
[1:27:09] you how close it hit I want to get this
[1:27:12] drilled into you that if that prophecy
[1:27:15] hit exactly to the date exactly to the
[1:27:17] time and exactly the way it said it
[1:27:19] would these other seven this one seven
[1:27:23] weeks left him corrects itself one seven
[1:27:26] years rather seven-day seven years will
[1:27:29] hit exactly according to the scripture
[1:27:30] what's the last seven he's talking about
[1:27:32] the third period that we're fixing to
[1:27:35] talk about just a second have I got that
[1:27:38] just reading what he said now remember
[1:27:42] he was cut off Mossad Jews God seems to
[1:27:45] deal with them they did not go any
[1:27:47] further then they were scattered by the
[1:27:50] Roman Empire and have you noticed on my
[1:27:52] chart here I want you to get this now
[1:27:54] and draw it you noticed here where I got
[1:27:56] the cross he's got it right here now
[1:27:58] what he did was and you're drawing it
[1:28:00] he's got he extend this out just a
[1:28:02] little bit and put eighty seventy so
[1:28:04] that's very important because remember
[1:28:06] what happened in eighty seventy some of
[1:28:08] you've been over there dancing over
[1:28:09] there russ has been over there about
[1:28:10] four times he knows that wall there's
[1:28:13] almost obliterated there is no
[1:28:14] Tabernacle there's hardly anything over
[1:28:16] there that was original when Jesus was
[1:28:19] walking on the earth because remember he
[1:28:20] told him he said this he said skorsky
[1:28:22] was talking about his own temple when he
[1:28:23] said destroy it and I'll raise it up in
[1:28:25] three days but they literally destroyed
[1:28:27] the temple back in eighty seventy so
[1:28:29] what's what brother mom says here I want
[1:28:31] you to get this now and draw it you
[1:28:33] notice here where I got the cross that's
[1:28:34] where they rejected but the time
[1:28:37] extended out just a little bit further
[1:28:39] on that see why 30 40 50 60 70 40 years
[1:28:44] later and I see he proves it again that
[1:28:46] Jesus was killed in 80 30 because he
[1:28:48] said 40 years later is 80 70 got it 80
[1:28:54] 70 Titus the Roman general destroyed
[1:28:57] Israel Jerusalem and scattered the
[1:28:59] people to all the world now why they'd
[1:29:01] they scattered now what's happening
[1:29:04] over here when we bring that last profit
[1:29:06] over here what are they doing they're
[1:29:09] coming back together cross comes on the
[1:29:14] scene he takes a rapture he goes up
[1:29:18] comes back down in the form of the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost coming down here
[1:29:22] Titus destroys the literal temple then
[1:29:27] God's building his other temple the
[1:29:30] Gentiles he's building the temple right
[1:29:32] here not not the wood not the wood in
[1:29:35] the bone I'm in the woods and the stone
[1:29:36] the bone and the flesh and all that yeah
[1:29:39] he's building it right here so he sends
[1:29:41] a prophet in the end of this thing
[1:29:43] - what introduced the same Crocs that
[1:29:45] was over here preached the same
[1:29:47] three-and-a-half-year message that was
[1:29:49] over here to us as what we were talking
[1:29:51] about the other day from spoken words
[1:29:53] original seed brother Russ has been
[1:29:55] taking 1260 days and going back from
[1:29:58] brother Brandon when he was when he had
[1:29:59] the accident back to - Grass Valley
[1:30:03] California he preaches Jehovah Jireh
[1:30:06] series and but and from that all the way
[1:30:08] up through spoken words original seeds
[1:30:10] the actual perfect man all those things
[1:30:12] we're building up in the 12 we got hey
[1:30:15] we got a message of three and a half
[1:30:16] years brother Byrne said it's the same
[1:30:17] exact message that Christ preached over
[1:30:20] here now look that same exact what I
[1:30:23] seen yesterday that same exact message
[1:30:25] from about right here - right here was
[1:30:28] not preached the same way does that mean
[1:30:35] you don't know what I longed about the
[1:30:39] furrow between the eyes father son Holy
[1:30:44] Ghost wasn't the original no no eternal
[1:30:48] hell they brought all that in right here
[1:30:51] that's not original God had to come back
[1:30:55] and bring a prophet like he did it first
[1:30:57] to bring it back to the original so we
[1:31:00] got the original Jesus never preached
[1:31:02] that he was the second person of a
[1:31:03] Trinity he never preached that you had
[1:31:06] to baptize her name of Father Son Holy
[1:31:07] Ghost he didn't preach that was an
[1:31:10] eternal hell what so the same 1260 days
[1:31:13] he preached right here he preaches right
[1:31:15] here and
[1:31:16] here very consistent all the way through
[1:31:22] because Christ what Christ came back
[1:31:24] what Holy Ghost brought the original
[1:31:27] word first couple of ages and then 325
[1:31:31] AD about the end of Martin's what it
[1:31:35] starts going down horrible doctrines
[1:31:37] brother Brown says the loose ends well
[1:31:40] what the loose ends have to be done they
[1:31:41] had to be tied back up in a
[1:31:42] three-and-a-half-year message starting
[1:31:44] as brother Dale says started in the 30s
[1:31:46] 40s 50s then you come up to the 60s and
[1:31:49] brother branham and spoken words reeling
[1:31:51] seed said as of yet Malachi 4 has not
[1:31:54] been fulfilled so there's the 1260 days
[1:31:59] to restore us back to the faith of the
[1:32:01] fathers and then bring his message and
[1:32:05] then bring his message of this
[1:32:08] revelation that's what struck me
[1:32:09] yesterday I told thank you Lord it's
[1:32:11] just a pattern that that it's so simple
[1:32:14] that anybody ought to be able to
[1:32:15] understand that it's the continuity
[1:32:19] brother Brown said the continuity of the
[1:32:21] message and I believe it's the
[1:32:22] continuity of the Bible there has to be
[1:32:25] continuity in this message of the hour
[1:32:27] so there's your 1260 days or three and a
[1:32:31] half years a preaching Paul preaching
[1:32:34] then everything fell across here comes
[1:32:36] back three and a half years to restore
[1:32:38] it back then you've got three and a half
[1:32:41] years 1260 days preached to the two
[1:32:44] widths of it from the two witnesses to
[1:32:45] bring 144,000 to a rapture what a mighty
[1:32:50] God we serve would you say that sister
[1:32:52] Joanie say it again Sam sister Joanie
[1:32:56] said I I won't sister Johnny to say your
[1:33:00] name nonsense Ernie I love that amen
[1:33:07] every time you see her and you say
[1:33:09] something to her she says what a mighty
[1:33:10] God we serve she's lost a lot of that
[1:33:13] New York accent thank goodness we can
[1:33:18] understand her now I want you to get it
[1:33:23] took now watch let's get back to our
[1:33:25] thought here we are Titus the Roman
[1:33:28] general destroyed Israel and scattered
[1:33:30] the people to all the world
[1:33:31] Titus forty years later so actually the
[1:33:33] Jewish time extended until now look God
[1:33:36] wasn't dealing with him he quit dealing
[1:33:38] with him at Calvary with the Jews as a
[1:33:42] nation he's not going to deal with the
[1:33:44] Jews as a nation - right here but he was
[1:33:46] dealing because remember the 120 in the
[1:33:48] upper room were all Jews so they did
[1:33:51] start with a Jewish root but it went and
[1:33:54] turned to the Gentiles everybody got
[1:33:56] that same answer brother Browns not
[1:33:58] wrong he's telling it exactly the right
[1:34:00] thing hmm
[1:34:02] God wasn't dealing with them he only
[1:34:04] dealt with them until they were ejected
[1:34:05] Christ then when they crucified Christ
[1:34:07] they said let his blood be on us and our
[1:34:09] children it has been ever since but
[1:34:12] before they got scattered oh brother
[1:34:14] before they got all scattered to the
[1:34:16] world that take God look it took God 40
[1:34:18] years to tear the temple up but once
[1:34:23] they've been taking watch him right here
[1:34:25] it's taped but it's taken 40 years to
[1:34:28] tear up the temple and scatter them to
[1:34:30] all the world but God failed to deal
[1:34:32] with them anymore God failed to deal
[1:34:34] with him anymore he went dealing with
[1:34:35] the Gentiles you know that understand it
[1:34:38] now now we start in the church ages the
[1:34:40] Gentile time well in another quote he
[1:34:42] says God has been bringing and spending
[1:34:43] almost that much time bringing him back
[1:34:45] into the homeland all right so let's
[1:34:49] read this real quick let's get to the
[1:34:50] very last one that's the last that's the
[1:34:53] sixty nine weeks or 483 years - ad 30
[1:34:58] April the 68030 when Christ was cut off
[1:35:00] he started dealing with the Gentiles now
[1:35:03] there's got to be though 490 years to
[1:35:07] finish Redemption right to finish the
[1:35:10] people and the city all right
[1:35:13] you've only got 483 years you've got a
[1:35:17] city or a tabernacle laid in waste
[1:35:20] even the walls not hardly there now but
[1:35:24] what's going to happen right here
[1:35:25] they're going to sure they're going to
[1:35:27] try to build it right here and start
[1:35:29] temple worship that's why I says the
[1:35:31] sacrifice and oblation will cease but
[1:35:33] that's not the one that to finish Daniel
[1:35:35] seventy weeks they got to build the
[1:35:37] temple that me and you walk into so you
[1:35:40] can't finish it right here or right here
[1:35:43] it's got to finish right here so there's
[1:35:45] what we've got 483 years we got to find
[1:35:48] 490 that leaves what seven years are one
[1:35:53] week he's seven years there's seven
[1:35:58] years left now listen to what I'm saying
[1:36:00] real quick and we'll read these quotes
[1:36:02] and we'll be done there's one week left
[1:36:05] of time listen to me there's one week
[1:36:09] left of time to finish Daniels 70 weeks
[1:36:13] I proved it by the Bible now there's
[1:36:16] only twelve hundred and sixty days of
[1:36:18] the Ministry of two prophets left but
[1:36:22] that's not to finish Daniel seventy
[1:36:24] weeks that's inside of Daniel seven
[1:36:26] newly everybody got that because the
[1:36:29] Bible says there's one week left this
[1:36:32] this god this man this Antichrist when
[1:36:35] we leave he's gonna strike up a
[1:36:37] agreement for what seven years what the
[1:36:41] Bible says he shall confirm the covenant
[1:36:43] with many for for what one week one week
[1:36:47] equals seven years and in the midst of
[1:36:50] the week he's gonna walk into that
[1:36:51] temple they built and he's gonna say
[1:36:53] I've got this is the one you've been
[1:36:56] looking for right here and they're gonna
[1:36:58] get so mad because that's gonna be a
[1:37:00] Gentile walking inside their temple and
[1:37:02] that's a no-no and they're gonna get so
[1:37:06] mad then guess what's gonna happen he's
[1:37:07] gonna get mad he's gonna kill two
[1:37:09] prophets he's gonna kill one hundred
[1:37:10] forty-four thousand and then what's
[1:37:12] gonna happen they're going to take a
[1:37:13] rapture so that what the Battle of
[1:37:17] Armageddon can begin and to finish the
[1:37:20] 70th week you got bringing everlasting
[1:37:24] righteousness seal up the vision and
[1:37:25] prophecy in the North the most holy
[1:37:27] that's got to happen right in here they
[1:37:30] got to build that Millennial temple you
[1:37:31] say how it's not to us it doesn't matter
[1:37:34] there is time left though because they
[1:37:36] got to come back down here and build it
[1:37:37] so that we in Revelation 19 21 can ride
[1:37:41] into the Millennium and go into that
[1:37:43] temple so it's got already be built now
[1:37:47] watch let's read these three quotes and
[1:37:48] we'll be finished 70th week of Daniel
[1:37:50] number 13 then we'll be done then we'll
[1:37:52] take communion now we find out that down
[1:37:55] through these ages we have the Holy
[1:37:57] Spirit come in and then God back in the
[1:37:59] beginning began to tell them at the
[1:38:01] rejection of Christ where's that right
[1:38:03] here God showed John exactly what would
[1:38:07] take place during the Gentile reign what
[1:38:09] John the Revelator revelations one two
[1:38:13] and three all right now you haven't got
[1:38:17] any limited time like the Jews but we
[1:38:20] got sign
[1:38:21] we got a signpost well God did with the
[1:38:26] Jews just exactly what he said he would
[1:38:29] do in them 69 years or 469 weeks or 483
[1:38:34] years so I just showed you he exactly
[1:38:37] done the right thing he eat it on 445 BC
[1:38:41] - right here now remember that's only
[1:38:43] 475 years of six 365 and a quarter but
[1:38:47] if you put it make it 360 days it comes
[1:38:48] out exactly to 483 years I've not got
[1:38:51] time to do that and it's just us figures
[1:38:53] but we got a sign when he said he would
[1:38:56] do in them 69 years or 483 years but 69
[1:39:00] weeks and one week left one weeks yet
[1:39:05] determined I don't know where people
[1:39:07] can't understand that one week according
[1:39:10] to the Bible is yet determined now we
[1:39:14] cannot apply it in here now look he
[1:39:16] tells them we can't apply it in here now
[1:39:18] look where is the Gentile part of this
[1:39:20] whole of this whole picture where's the
[1:39:24] Gentiles right here right here he says
[1:39:28] we cannot apply it in here see that's
[1:39:30] what the people the message do they say
[1:39:32] there's only three and a half years left
[1:39:33] this is not a part of it and that three
[1:39:36] and a half years are stuck over here
[1:39:37] somewhere in this first church age or
[1:39:38] back over in that way can't happen
[1:39:40] according to the Bible according the
[1:39:43] prophets message and you can't stick the
[1:39:45] Jews and the Gentiles together
[1:39:48] you can't do that brother Brown tells us
[1:39:50] over and over again you can't deal with
[1:39:52] the JIT he doesn't deal with the Jews
[1:39:53] and the Gentiles at the same time
[1:39:54] doesn't either we gotta be out of the
[1:39:56] way tor they've got to be out of the way
[1:39:58] all right now number 14 on the 70 weed
[1:40:01] now my Pentecostal brethren now about
[1:40:04] y'all hold a witness brethren do you
[1:40:06] realize do you know where 144,000 appear
[1:40:08] do you know where all the great miracles
[1:40:11] of Revelation appear over in the Jewish
[1:40:14] age not in ours now are they gonna peer
[1:40:17] over here are they gonna peer here I'm
[1:40:25] reading a quote over in the Jewess age
[1:40:28] not in ours there's nothing recorded in
[1:40:32] it just the church getting ready and
[1:40:34] going out sure with the power of God we
[1:40:38] can work miracles and exploits we know
[1:40:39] that but the real thing was over here to
[1:40:42] the Jews I mean the real working power
[1:40:46] miracle working because remember them
[1:40:48] two prophets they're gonna do whatever
[1:40:50] they want to do now look the 144,000
[1:40:53] don't appear there I believe they're
[1:40:59] over there I believe they're over there
[1:41:01] now this is so close
[1:41:04] they can't be babies and they could be
[1:41:07] older people but they've got to be over
[1:41:09] there somewhere
[1:41:10] right now waiting on us to take a
[1:41:13] rapture and then God's going to go
[1:41:15] straight to them
[1:41:19] what a mighty God we serve 144,000 don't
[1:41:24] appear there they're over they appear
[1:41:26] not in the third chapter what's the
[1:41:28] third chapter revelations the church
[1:41:30] ages their own over in the scripture
[1:41:35] further revelations 11 and now we see
[1:41:39] that all this stuff was to take place
[1:41:41] was over in this time of the 70th week
[1:41:47] the last week now if they've already had
[1:41:53] 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way
[1:41:56] God said they did and it happened
[1:41:59] exactly the way God said it would do
[1:42:02] then there's one more week promised to
[1:42:05] the Jews how much more plain can you be
[1:42:09] number 15 and then we'll clues he keeps
[1:42:13] talking something in Pentecost musta got
[1:42:15] him because now he's saying the same
[1:42:17] thing again now how now Pentecostal
[1:42:20] brethren how can you apply it all over
[1:42:22] in the layout of CNH you can't that's
[1:42:25] still Gentiles they're sleeping through
[1:42:29] every one of these ages look waiting on
[1:42:32] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:42:34] what brother Dale read or in Hebrews 11
[1:42:36] they're waiting on us this whole 7
[1:42:39] church age is the way don't us to come
[1:42:40] to place and we which are alive the
[1:42:45] little remaining bunch over here alive
[1:42:47] some of you may be asleep but alive
[1:42:51] breathing there you go maybe Lewis you
[1:42:59] don't have to interpret all that okay
[1:43:01] the brothers smiling back here so he
[1:43:03] understands what he said I'm not except
[1:43:08] a couple of things out with them remain
[1:43:10] alive until the coming of the Lord will
[1:43:13] not hinder those which are asleep for
[1:43:15] the trumpet of God shall sound and the
[1:43:17] dead in Christ shall rise first and we
[1:43:19] shall be caught up together with them
[1:43:21] Amen with them here we are meeting right
[1:43:24] here and I look on your chart he's got
[1:43:25] the rapture taking place right here all
[1:43:28] this going up alright so he's still on
[1:43:31] his chart
[1:43:31] to go to meet the Lord in the air a man
[1:43:34] and there you are
[1:43:36] where we at here it is right here where
[1:43:40] we at they wouldn't say that in
[1:43:43] Minnesota where are we at where are we
[1:43:48] at right here where did the Messiah get
[1:43:53] cut off exactly where the word said
[1:43:56] where will that 70th week begin exactly
[1:44:02] after this church is cut off right here
[1:44:07] that's me and you then God returns
[1:44:10] to the Jews to fulfill that last week
[1:44:16] don't you remember as soon as the church
[1:44:19] goes the church goes in the Jews take
[1:44:21] hold come in but first the next thing in
[1:44:24] order is not a mighty nation on a
[1:44:26] national revival amongst the Gentiles
[1:44:29] the next thing in order is the coming of
[1:44:31] the kingdom of God the coming of Christ
[1:44:34] that's what we're looking for right now
[1:44:36] that's what you and I are looking for
[1:44:39] but don't let anybody fool you to fulfil
[1:44:45] listen to me one more time everybody get
[1:44:48] ready to have taken communion put that
[1:44:51] in the study so we'll have that you
[1:44:53] wanna do it you want me to fulfill all
[1:44:58] of Daniels 70 weeks to fulfill 490 years
[1:45:05] that God has promised to deal with the
[1:45:08] Jews to take them out take them up and
[1:45:11] to build the temple there's one week
[1:45:17] left to fulfill that there is not three
[1:45:23] and a half years left yes there is three
[1:45:25] and a half years left of the 1260 days
[1:45:29] for the Jews to be saved if I got that
[1:45:34] there is not seven years of tribulation
[1:45:37] I want you to understand that we're not
[1:45:40] preaching seven years tribulation
[1:45:42] there's only three and a half years of
[1:45:44] tribulation but that has nothing to do
[1:45:46] with Daniel 70 weeks
[1:45:48] Daniel 70 weeks is 490 years period
[1:45:51] we've already lived 483 everyone was
[1:45:55] back at Christ and back further know
[1:45:56] what's left is one more week I'm not
[1:45:59] saying there's seven years left of
[1:46:01] tribulation I'm not saying there's seven
[1:46:03] years of Jesus's ministry left there's
[1:46:06] only twelve hundred and sixty days of
[1:46:08] Jesus's ministry but to finish Daniels
[1:46:12] 70 weeks there has to be one week left
[1:46:17] after the rapture of the church has to
[1:46:20] be according to the Bible
[1:46:23] according to the prophets message now
[1:46:24] what I'll do the next time I speak I'm
[1:46:26] going to bring you those quotes that you
[1:46:28] think are some of you think it's
[1:46:30] contrary to everything I preached but
[1:46:33] you think brother Branham was that
[1:46:34] confused do you really
[1:46:40] you better not then you've made him a
[1:46:43] false prophet just like the people that
[1:46:45] leave the message you've got the same
[1:46:47] spirit they do you just ain't got enough
[1:46:49] sense to leave I mean really if you
[1:46:52] think brother Branham was wrong you need
[1:46:54] to go find something else I need to go
[1:46:57] find something else but I know he ain't
[1:46:58] wrong brother RT I know he's not what a
[1:47:01] mighty God we serve I know he's not
[1:47:05] wrong
[1:47:06] no wait was he wrong you saw no it looks
[1:47:09] like he counted it he never he did not
[1:47:11] contradict yourself he said exactly what
[1:47:14] he meant and meant what he said but he
[1:47:18] cannot one more time let's stand our
[1:47:19] feet and whoever's doing the communion
[1:47:23] come on there's one week left after the
[1:47:27] rapture of the church according to the
[1:47:28] Bible and according to the prophets
[1:47:30] message I don't need anybody else's
[1:47:32] commentary even you look back at the
[1:47:35] chart that Clarence Larkin drew it's
[1:47:38] exactly that same chart that brother
[1:47:39] Branham drew now you say well Clarence
[1:47:42] Larkin was this and any other you know
[1:47:43] what do you believe Dwight Moody was a
[1:47:48] was a fake you believe Dwight Moody was
[1:47:52] a child of God brother branham said he
[1:47:55] sent millions to heaven oh he had to
[1:47:58] have some kind of ministry but he was a
[1:48:01] trinitarian he believed in the eternal
[1:48:04] hell there was a lot of different things
[1:48:06] doctrines he believed but like what I'm
[1:48:08] the point I'm making
[1:48:09] Clarence Larkin drew the same chart
[1:48:11] brother Branham could have looked at it
[1:48:13] and that was fine but brother Branham
[1:48:14] needed a revelation that went beyond
[1:48:16] Clarence Larkin Clarence Larkin may have
[1:48:18] been a good preacher he may have been a
[1:48:22] good teacher but he wasn't the Prophet
[1:48:24] to take the loose ends and straighten
[1:48:27] the loose ends out now that's the one I
[1:48:28] want to hear and that's good to hear
[1:48:30] these other people but it's wonderful to
[1:48:32] hear the man that took the loose ends
[1:48:34] and put them all back together again
[1:48:36] so don't tell me brother branham was
[1:48:38] robbing if he was wrong he corrected it
[1:48:40] right I've never heard him correct
[1:48:43] dangle 70 weeks I've never heard him say
[1:48:45] the chart was wrong I've never heard him
[1:48:47] say that what I preached was wrong so
[1:48:49] let's just leave it at that all right
[1:48:51] god bless you let's go write it in the
[1:48:53] communion if you want to be prayed for
[1:48:55] it's when in brothers hands you the
[1:48:57] communion bread and the wine I've seen
[1:48:59] people we've seen people healed by
[1:49:01] taking communion why you're believing
[1:49:03] that you're not communing with those
[1:49:05] you're not coming with me you're
[1:49:07] communing with God all right you're not
[1:49:09] communing with a human being you're
[1:49:10] communicating with God or communing with
[1:49:12] God when you're taking the communion you
[1:49:15] ought to just forget all the other
[1:49:16] things like I told the kids yesterday
[1:49:17] forget all the if your friend don't
[1:49:19] raise his hand don't feel don't be have
[1:49:22] a complex that you're not gonna raise
[1:49:23] yours if you got that feeling you raise
[1:49:26] your hand if you have a if you have an
[1:49:28] unction from God do it amen here we go
[1:49:36] in first corinthians see it took a
[1:49:38] prophet
[1:49:39] this right here proves my point it took
[1:49:42] a prophet in the first church age to
[1:49:45] straighten up everything and get
[1:49:47] everything right because paul was not in
[1:49:50] the upper room when this was instituted
[1:49:55] in 80 59 Paul wasn't even a convert of
[1:49:58] Christ he was actually the one they
[1:50:02] feared because they had the door locks
[1:50:05] because they were persecuting the
[1:50:07] Christians Paul was and then but then
[1:50:11] you say well like brother Dale says
[1:50:13] Peter and James John they were all in
[1:50:16] this upper room but not one of them
[1:50:18] spoke of the communion to Institute it
[1:50:21] what's this Ernie says for I have
[1:50:23] received of the Lord Paul got it
[1:50:26] straight from God just like brother
[1:50:27] Branham got it straight from God there
[1:50:30] was nobody in between if you think you
[1:50:31] can correct brother Branham you have
[1:50:33] inserted yourself in between God and a
[1:50:35] prophet and usually that might make you
[1:50:38] an antichrist okay but you can't have
[1:50:41] two over here and one over here it's got
[1:50:43] to be God in you all right let's read
[1:50:45] this let's read the scripture god bless
[1:50:49] you thank you for
[1:50:50] for taking time and I know some of its
[1:50:54] just dates and times and different
[1:50:56] things but to me I saw the continuity of
[1:50:59] what God was doing continuity all the
[1:51:02] way through and then we had a man stand
[1:51:04] in this endtime that told us the whole
[1:51:06] plan the whole thing what a privileged
[1:51:10] people we are what a mighty God we do
[1:51:13] serve I'm not trying to be sacrilegious
[1:51:16] but I love when she says that it just
[1:51:18] makes chills going my spine because what
[1:51:20] a mighty God we do serve I wouldn't want
[1:51:22] to serve another one for I have received
[1:51:27] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:51:30] unto you in other words he received it
[1:51:31] from the Lord and he's fixing to tell us
[1:51:34] in 1st Corinthians he's fixing to tell
[1:51:35] us what happened in the upper room that
[1:51:38] he wasn't even there God showed him a
[1:51:40] vision of what went on and then give him
[1:51:43] a revelation of when Jesus said eat my
[1:51:45] flesh and drink my blood all right that
[1:51:50] the Lord Jesus the same night in which
[1:51:52] he was betrayed took bread this would be
[1:51:56] I would say this is gonna be thirsty
[1:51:59] afternoon and when he had given thanks
[1:52:02] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:52:04] body which is broken for you this doing
[1:52:07] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:52:11] also he took the cup and when he had
[1:52:13] supped saying this cup is the New
[1:52:16] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:52:20] as you drink it in remembrance of me
[1:52:23] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:52:25] drink this cup you do show the Lord's
[1:52:27] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:52:31] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:52:34] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:52:36] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:52:40] let a man examine himself sees you you
[1:52:42] think right there mo we're all guilty we
[1:52:44] can't take it watch what Paul says but
[1:52:47] let a man examine himself let a man
[1:52:50] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:52:53] that bread and drink of that Cup for he
[1:52:57] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:52:58] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:53:00] not discerning the Lord's body now who
[1:53:03] is the law
[1:53:03] body not him up there the physical
[1:53:05] witness right here alright for this
[1:53:08] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:53:10] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:53:12] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:53:14] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:53:16] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:53:18] with the world kind of saddens me that
[1:53:22] I've told you before some of you weren't
[1:53:24] here I was listening to a Christian
[1:53:27] radio station and they were making light
[1:53:30] that everything was made out of pumpkin
[1:53:31] spice in November and that you know last
[1:53:35] year there was toilet paper and all
[1:53:37] these different things made out of
[1:53:38] pumpkin spice and one of the somebody
[1:53:39] called in and said well our church has
[1:53:41] found where we can get pumpkin spice
[1:53:43] communion bread that's almost
[1:53:50] blasphemous now pumpkin spice communion
[1:53:54] bread just because that they don't count
[1:53:56] it they don't count it like we do
[1:53:58] this is unleavened bread made with holy
[1:54:00] hands there's nothing good about it it's
[1:54:03] just going to be something we partake of
[1:54:06] but see that's what the world has went
[1:54:08] to pumpkin spice communion bread heaven
[1:54:13] helpful where for my brother and when
[1:54:15] you come together to eat tarry one for
[1:54:17] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:54:19] eat at home that you come not together
[1:54:21] unto condemnation and the rest while I
[1:54:23] sit in order when I come
