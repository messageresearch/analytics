right let's finish this stuff doctor sixteen this is Paul continuing to the Romans and then we'll do the cargo cover I come in - Phoebe our sister once is a servant of the church was is that century of me that she received her in the Lord was my I think moving now it is that you receive her and the laureates becoming Saints and that just in time whatever been this yet need of you where she had the best score of many which is what the core is someone that takes care of someone I helped her of many and myself also so Paul's commending a sister now he brother drowns at home they say Paul with a woman-hater said brother Randall does woman haters but if you'll read it right that's not true right hold them to very high esteem yeah same thing here with her she's been a helper of mania and I myself also grief for selling the killer you know those are the two tent makers that he lived with and they they were his boss for a little while and no my helpers in Christ Jesus who have for my life laid down their own necks remember I told you the story about how priscilla and aquila came in and saved paul's from certain certain saying stoning or some of them and to him not only I give thanks but also all the churches of the Gentiles likewise greet the church that is in their house salute my well-beloved mantis who is the first fruit of acacia or Asia into Christ Greek Mary who bestowed much labor on us and salute Andronicus in you mechanically and my fellow prisoner so I've known among the Apostles we lost over in Christ before me now remember he's winding down his letter so he

real mother but you have mothers in the gospel so live all them other people couldn't have just some way to Bob connected with joy slowly absolutely Twila the whole the kids to church of christ will achieve Churches of Christ with you now beseech you brethren mark them which cause division and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have learned and avoid them if I got that what an arrhenius day when serene theist was in the same bath houses within remember he runs out of the bathhouse and said I don't want to be caught in in the same room with that infidel or that well and all him and not say all but when he was preaching was which Christ wasn't God he was a like a demon God or a sang a person or or he was became died at the River Jordan we've heard those doctors before they're not new they're all just dug up from them yeah so the demons don't die the day remember demons just keep traveling they travel through dimensions and they didn't they traveled in that dimension and what happened was somebody opened their self up for that doctrine I say whether the Trinity you think God ever brought a Trinity into the end of being no the devil brought the Trinity into a being but as man accepted it I went to take nurse of man because they didn't have teaching like we have now and they had gotten away from the first love as the first church they said because the first church age remember had no second person of Christ they had no Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan they held Baptist Methodist and Pentecostal and all these different doctrines they only have one doctrine and that was the doctrine of the classroom yes and Paul you know said in his character before the gospel which I preached mark them or know them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you've learned and avoid them for they are such serve not our Lord Jesus gospel now obviously they're preachers because they're preaching a doctrine ya know not uh not an evil to say what I mean by evil they're trying to preach I guess what they see but they're trying to fill their own bellies and my good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple we know that that term that goes on all the time innocent for your obedience is come abroad unto all men now not obedience to Paul remember we know don't give them obedience to program we have obedience to God Paul was a servant from the ground with servant so we include them in that but his obedience here is saying I'm glad you're obedient to the word I'm glad you're obedient to what we're preaching I am glad that for on your behalf but yeah when have you wait lies unto that which is good and simple concerning evil all right and the daughter peace shall bruise Satan under your feet under your feet so the bride is where we'll go back to genesis 3:15 remember Satan's gonna bruise his heel we're gonna bruise his hand so we're gonna vice versa but look you tell this right here shortly we know one thing for sure Paul no remember what we're talking about polish prophesy he's telling a group of people but you and I are gonna have to become that and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet period yes period now shortly there's no shortly no more this is it period okay and the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be with you amen Timothy's my work fellow and lucius and jason and soap painter my kinsmen salute you I turn us who wrote this epistle to limit you in the Lord courteous you didn't know Paul's name with 30 opinion he wrote this official guys month host and of the whole church salute saluted you erastus the chamberlain of the city salute jim Quartus my brother the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen now to him that is the power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets now he's talking about the Old Testament he's healing the Prophet is talking in the New Testament right now they haven't been a property to rock the Bible and writing the Bible according to the commandment of the everlasting God made known to all nations for the obedience of faith to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever amen but Paul is finished with this writing to the Romans and the book of Romans to me is it's a powerful book it tells us how to live I do how to work we went through all the adoption part of it wrong Romans 8 there's therefore now no condemnation wooden cross to use he won't have to play and then he ends up his he ends up his whole chapter of the book of Romans saluting the people that are with him in other words face picking them up then hey I may be going to Rome but all these people here you need to you need to listen to them because they have my gospel right and that's what Paul's told to me like brother Browns that Paul didn't going to a nation or into a country and stay there for months he would stay there and establish one person get them established and then he would move on there's no reason for me to go to the Philippines and spend three months I'm not a Filipino but we're going to go over there bring the preachers together establish them in the gospel a little bit more I'm gonna get out of there come back here home where I'm supposed to be and then you know what what better than preaching every Wednesday every Sunday every wins he ever Sunday every Wednesday it was Sunday every wins the other Sunday because God can speak to them just as well as he speaks to us there is no difference because we're Americans and because we're in Lula there's no difference doc can speak to them but that guy hear it first so you present the gospel to them that's what Paul's doing he goes out presents the gospel and I don't know I believe Paul made being preaching to a bunch of people and all of a sudden the Lord show him or he sees an interest in just one or two not five hundred just one or two people and I believe Paul would being them the master he is he would go to that person and establish him you know what that's the Lord leading you to do that right leading you to strengthen how you going to strengthen the brother that doesn't want to be strengthened see you just wasting your time right that's why you say it move on don't even be caught with them what do you say what was that mark 10 which caused the vision and offenses contrary to the doctrine which ye have heard and avoid them all right it didn't say shun I'm gonna throw them in you know going in ditch he just said avoid them in other words Paul says I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on somebody that don't want to hear the gospel why because he just he just falls on deaf ears Paul's a master Paul's a prophet but I mean I'm telling you Paul that's why why would God want 80% of the New Testament that concerns us why would he want somebody to write it except Paul Paul would be the one I'd want to write it to cook you know why because Paul standing here he's already been a Pharisee he's been a part of the priesthood over here in the Old Testament part the scrolls in the Torah he is so well versed in that Peter what Peter was just a dumb fisherman and Ivan if he's sitting and he said yeah well that's he couldn't write his name now and probably had to have somebody write his first Peter second Peter and all that you know but he he told them and but here you got Paul writing these letters personally he's writing letters personally so God is speaking and then God said okay that's the Word of God that's eternal that's gonna stay there forever that's part of the Word of God so so we thank God for that all right so we're gonna have just a little bit of play time first 22 that night dr. Deisher a poll has trouble seeing yeah probably write another word to help derived the Epistle to the Romans yes I you know Paul you got to remember Paul didn't meet Luke wrote the book of Acts it was the Acts of the Apostles a lot of it was Paul but Luke running wrote the book black hole welcome back Luke wrote and he runs the Book of Luke in the book of Acts but what happened was in the book of Acts Luke was Paul personalisation so I went way to member where he went he just attached it I don't hook him say I'm sure I don't think Paul paid him to be there to be a doctor but Luke was a physician so blue but Luke got tied to Paul and then he wrote the whole book of Acts well that was a lot a lot of it was possible so so I'm not saying that Paul wrote the whole thing but he did he spoke to somebody in that wrote or in there a lot of times sometimes in here somewhere in one of these he says I write this by my own hand okay so in other words he does Rock some of it by his own hand and then you have tertius here who did that football am I ready take one of each has anybody named Vince yeah man it's for free Vince for free for the next 30 minutes and then you put them I go later all right you got one yeah yeah take a thank a there you go yeah take one pass it around
