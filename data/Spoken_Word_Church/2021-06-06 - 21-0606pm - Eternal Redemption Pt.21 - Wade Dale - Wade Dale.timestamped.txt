[27:30] and thank you for all participating and
[27:32] for all of you coming
[27:33] um it's like christine yorego says she
[27:35] said if you don't show up for this
[27:37] then this is not your church
[27:40] i didn't say that christine said that
[27:43] because this is one time this is we're
[27:44] asking you for one weekend
[27:47] one weekend okay to help and to do and
[27:50] to serve that we've had 50 years of this
[27:52] building
[27:53] starting as a little bitty place and
[27:54] then grown into
[27:56] into all this and and i want to thank
[27:59] god for
[28:00] for for two things we've never had a
[28:03] split in this church
[28:06] we have actually grown so a large
[28:10] we have grown so large so we have
[28:12] spawned churches off of this church
[28:14] dad's told him that hey you need to quit
[28:16] driving four hours you need to go
[28:17] start you know start your church up
[28:19] there somewhere so
[28:21] and then that the words being preached
[28:22] pure and unadulterated
[28:25] that will keep a church from splitting
[28:27] when you preach the word and you let
[28:29] people know what's going on
[28:31] you preach the depth of the message you
[28:33] preach where nobody can have a
[28:34] question sure we all have questions but
[28:36] not doctrinal issues if you've got
[28:38] doctrinal questions you just haven't
[28:39] been around here long enough you'll
[28:40] learn
[28:41] amen that um as i said before
[28:45] and it's really not we give all the
[28:48] honor to jesus christ
[28:50] but it has to be preached through
[28:51] somebody so you give the honor to
[28:54] brother dale brother moat
[28:55] brother moat started the seeds of all
[28:57] this came from him and then it come to
[28:59] brother dale
[29:00] and then i believe the other four of us
[29:02] in the church
[29:03] are supporting
[29:07] what brother dale's been preaching for
[29:08] 50 years so
[29:10] if you do that i think that everything
[29:12] is is
[29:13] it runs good sure we're like family we
[29:16] have our issues and our problems but
[29:17] we don't have major issues because
[29:21] satan can do anything in the world
[29:23] except preach the word word by word
[29:26] he can't do that he can give out
[29:28] spiritual gifts he can make you shout
[29:30] he'll make you speak in tongues he'll
[29:31] make you do all kind of things
[29:33] but he cannot preach the word word by
[29:35] word and keep it in line
[29:37] so if you do that then i told him at
[29:39] brother pageants you can stand to your
[29:40] feet now
[29:41] brother pageants i told him i said
[29:42] listen i want the devil to be
[29:44] uncomfortable in this building
[29:47] i do not want the devil to be
[29:49] comfortable in this building
[29:51] if he's comfortable in this building we
[29:53] have a problem
[29:54] we want to be we know he's here we want
[29:58] him to be the most
[29:59] uncomfortable person in this building
[30:01] right
[30:02] and if he does he'll keep his mouth shut
[30:05] maybe he'll leave one of these days but
[30:08] that's the outline of what we're going
[30:09] to do if you have any questions
[30:11] anna june lisa dale and any of the
[30:14] deacons and
[30:15] any of the support people musicians just
[30:18] ask
[30:18] say hey what can i do and then everybody

[34:03] perfect tabernacle
[34:05] not made by hands that is to say not of
[34:07] this building
[34:08] neither by the blood of goats and cows
[34:11] but by his own blood he entered in once
[34:14] into the holy place and here's the the
[34:17] scripture that we've read for 21 times
[34:19] now having
[34:20] obtained eternal redemption for
[34:23] us so he obtained something and it was
[34:26] not for him
[34:27] he obtained it for me and you what a
[34:29] gracious god let's read romans 11 verse
[34:31] 25 and be seated
[34:33] for i would not brethren that you should
[34:34] be ignorant of this mystery
[34:36] lest you should be wise in your own
[34:38] conceits that blindness in part has
[34:40] happened
[34:41] to israel until the fullness of the
[34:44] gentiles
[34:45] become you may be seated in the lord as
[34:46] blessing to the reading of the word now
[34:48] let's go to ephesians 1 his brother dale
[34:50] had been talking about the
[34:53] the great ephesians church paul could
[34:56] not preach this to the corinthians he
[34:58] could only preach this to the ephesians
[34:59] because they were a mature church
[35:01] and they knew what paul was talking
[35:03] about well you and i should be mature
[35:04] christians at this point in time in our
[35:06] life
[35:07] that we can understand this and not
[35:08] choke on it
[35:10] amen as i tell you before let's just lay
[35:13] this thing on the line if you can't
[35:14] understand the message of the hour if
[35:16] you can't understand
[35:17] the bible you're not born again
[35:20] just admit it why in the world would god
[35:23] give us something
[35:26] and give us the new birth and they don't
[35:28] connect right
[35:30] right how can that happen it can't
[35:33] happen
[35:34] it's just your mouth so malnourished
[35:36] that you don't have the new birth that
[35:38] maybe you had an experience
[35:39] but you had just a maybe a um an egg
[35:42] under a
[35:43] a dog experience you understand what i
[35:45] mean you know you might have had a birth
[35:47] but
[35:47] you didn't get all the way you didn't go
[35:49] all the way
[35:50] and let the message of the hour see to
[35:52] me look the messenger hour doesn't save
[35:54] us
[35:55] right it keeps us clean makes us go up
[35:58] that statue of perfect man and changes
[36:00] this guy
[36:02] it changes us into the image of god
[36:05] there's a little thought i want to give
[36:07] maybe next sunday
[36:08] but not this sunday let's go through
[36:10] this and i'm having the background
[36:11] because we've got some new ones here and
[36:13] that's okay
[36:14] according as he has chosen us where in
[36:16] him
[36:18] listen as brother dale was saying this
[36:19] morning judas
[36:21] was chosen of god adolph hitler was
[36:24] chosen of god the foolish virgin
[36:27] everybody was chosen of god except the
[36:29] bride of jesus christ
[36:32] the bride of jesus christ was chosen in
[36:34] him
[36:35] amen before the foundation of the world
[36:38] so that's me and you he has chosen
[36:40] us in him before the foundation of the
[36:42] world that we should be what holy and
[36:44] without blame before him in love
[36:46] he said i can't do that get born again
[36:49] quit making excuses that's what the
[36:52] world makes we were talking about last
[36:53] night in the sunday school class
[36:54] anybody you talk to you start talking to
[36:57] them about holiness and about hair and
[36:59] about
[36:59] dress and about uh we don't smoke and we
[37:02] don't drink and we don't curse and we
[37:03] don't do these things
[37:05] and they're like well i'm not perfect
[37:07] you're not perfect you know they'll tell
[37:08] you that
[37:09] i think i said well you're not serving
[37:11] the same god i'm serving
[37:12] right there's not listen
[37:16] there's not two gods that give you the
[37:20] same thing
[37:22] one's holy one's unholy there ain't no
[37:25] in-between
[37:26] you either got this one or you got this
[37:28] one
[37:29] there is no second or third or fourth
[37:31] god we got to deal with there's
[37:33] the almighty god and the one that wants
[37:35] to be god right
[37:36] and the one that wants to be god is
[37:38] sitting here today
[37:42] showing himself to be as god right you
[37:45] got to discern
[37:46] or determine or judge what you're
[37:49] hearing today
[37:50] look having predestinated us as brother
[37:52] dale was talking about
[37:54] predestinated us what unto adoption
[37:56] there's no other age and we'll talk
[37:57] about the ages in a minute
[38:00] because there's a seven church ages that
[38:02] had to come because it was
[38:04] already determined in the bible that we
[38:06] needed seven messengers we needed seven
[38:08] ages
[38:09] we needed seven stars okay because it
[38:12] said in the bible that's what we needed
[38:14] to get us to revelations five which is
[38:16] coming to redemption is everybody okay
[38:17] with that
[38:18] amen but we had to remember jesus didn't
[38:21] come to save the gentiles at first
[38:26] he came to his own and his own received
[38:28] him not he had to put her away
[38:30] because of her whoredom and we'll read
[38:32] that in just a minute having
[38:33] predestinated us
[38:34] unto adoption of children by jesus
[38:37] christ to himself according to the good
[38:39] pleasure of his will
[38:40] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[38:42] when he hath made us
[38:43] accepted in the beloved you're already
[38:46] accepted right exactly
[38:48] there's no i'm not if you got the new
[38:50] birth you've already been accepted amen
[38:53] amen stop worrying about the past
[38:57] if if truly you're born again god don't
[39:00] know what you did in your past
[39:03] he can't even bring it up himself you
[39:05] say my god can do anything no
[39:07] he cannot remember my sin if i ask him
[39:10] to forgive me
[39:11] and he said that i didn't that's right
[39:14] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[39:16] when hath made us accepted in the
[39:18] beloved
[39:19] look in whom we have redemption through
[39:21] his blood
[39:22] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[39:24] riches of his grace
[39:25] wherein he has abounded toward us that
[39:27] word abounded mean heaps on top of us
[39:31] in all wisdom and prudence look having
[39:33] made known unto us the mystery of his
[39:35] wealth so if you've got the new birth
[39:36] you will know the mystery of his will
[39:39] but if you don't have the new birth
[39:41] he's not obligated to give you this
[39:43] mystery right
[39:44] he's not obligated to give you any i
[39:47] like what brother dale said years ago
[39:49] when he was preaching on adoption he
[39:50] said
[39:50] god does not adopt the devil's kids
[39:55] he don't have to they chose to be the
[39:57] devils
[39:58] so he can't adopt them and he's not
[40:00] going to adopt them
[40:02] he's going to adopt his own children
[40:04] having made known
[40:05] unto us the mystery of his will
[40:08] according to his good pleasure with he
[40:09] has purposed in himself
[40:11] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[40:13] of times now today we're going to talk
[40:14] about dispensations because there was
[40:16] a dispensation for israel there's a
[40:19] dispensation for
[40:20] the gentiles and then god goes right
[40:22] back to the jews again for a
[40:24] dispensation of 144 thousands everybody
[40:26] got that
[40:27] if i get too fast you just go out to
[40:28] look what listen to the tape again
[40:30] then in dispensation of the fullness of
[40:32] times he might gather together what
[40:34] in one not at 900 different
[40:36] denominations and i'm talking about the
[40:37] message
[40:38] right right
[40:41] folks god is not confused
[40:44] right there's a truth to the message
[40:49] and not another that's right one
[40:52] faith one lord one baptism
[40:56] one message of the hour not a hundred
[40:58] different messages of the hour
[41:00] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[41:02] of times he might gather together in one
[41:05] all things in christ both which are in
[41:07] heaven and which are on earth even in
[41:09] him
[41:10] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[41:13] an inheritance
[41:15] remember i read you the quote last week
[41:16] a week before last where brother brown
[41:18] said jesus didn't come to bring
[41:20] you your inheritance right jesus didn't
[41:23] come down here to develop a plan
[41:26] he didn't come down here just to make
[41:28] people feel sorry for him
[41:29] and they might get saved no he came down
[41:32] here for a purpose now you wouldn't it'd
[41:34] all be saved but he came down here to
[41:35] get me in you
[41:38] in whom also we have obtained an
[41:40] inheritance jesus didn't come to bring
[41:42] us inheritance he came to what
[41:44] pay for our inheritance to get us back
[41:47] to our inheritance because our
[41:48] inheritance was what brother dale talked
[41:50] about this morning
[41:50] that lamb's book of life was before the
[41:52] foundation of the world
[41:55] and you and i were in his mind at
[41:57] calvary and he said i'm dying for this
[41:59] one i'm dying for that one i'm dying for
[42:01] this one i'm dying for that one
[42:02] sure we know the bible says he died for
[42:04] the whole world but he knew who would
[42:05] and who wouldn't as according to
[42:07] that's right for knowledge
[42:11] you got to have foreknowledge before you
[42:12] have predestination
[42:14] but predestination is really simple to
[42:16] understand if you
[42:17] do if you take foreign knowledge first
[42:20] amen
[42:20] those who he foreknew he did
[42:22] predestinate
[42:24] okay so what it looks back that looks
[42:26] back to for now
[42:27] everything has to look back to foreign
[42:29] knowledge if not then you've just put
[42:31] him in a tube
[42:32] you know we just if paul's going to make
[42:34] it and freda's not
[42:38] i decided that god said no he didn't
[42:41] because you know what i'm just sorry
[42:44] you're sitting on the front row
[42:47] because what freda can do freda can go
[42:49] the white throne judgment said why did
[42:50] you say
[42:51] priest why did you pre-save him and not
[42:54] me
[42:55] because your bible says whosoever will
[42:57] you can take the bible back but to be a
[42:59] just god
[43:00] he knew one would and he knew one would
[43:02] not amen
[43:04] that's always bothered me for years how
[43:06] that god could take somebody's life
[43:07] early
[43:09] he's the only one that takes life right
[43:10] gives life and takes life
[43:12] how these young people live short lives
[43:14] and how that somebody like adolf hitler
[43:16] could live to a certain time and then
[43:18] then take his own self off the scene and
[43:19] him be just a horrible person
[43:21] you know what if you look at
[43:22] predestination by foreign knowledge he
[43:25] that if he'd let adolf hitler live for
[43:26] one million years
[43:30] adolf hitler would never come to a day
[43:32] of repentance
[43:33] therefore he could take him anytime he
[43:35] needed to
[43:36] because he knew that he could for he
[43:38] foreign you by infinite knowledge
[43:40] he said okay i'm going to let adolf
[43:42] hitler live for 80 years and then
[43:44] on his 81st first year he's going to
[43:47] accept me well god will let him live
[43:48] that long
[43:49] but he knew that he said well we'll give
[43:51] him 200 years we'll give him 300 years
[43:53] he knew he never would come to it so
[43:55] therefore he could take him anytime he
[43:56] needed to
[43:57] that's right so to me that's very simple
[44:00] showing that god
[44:01] foreign all these things what but what's
[44:03] it for it's for his purpose
[44:06] according to the purpose of him who
[44:08] worketh all things
[44:10] after the counsel of his own will and
[44:12] what the prophet of god tell us what his
[44:14] will is his will is his word
[44:16] amen everybody okay with that but i look
[44:18] at this next quote
[44:20] we know that the lamb and the heifer and
[44:22] all the different animals in the old
[44:23] testament
[44:24] could only push sin to calvary it
[44:26] couldn't eradicate sin god could
[44:28] remember what they did because it was
[44:30] only covered
[44:31] or capoed by the blood of an animal but
[44:34] when this
[44:35] god set up this plan amen when god set
[44:39] up this plan
[44:40] it was perfect right he knew he was
[44:43] going to have to
[44:44] create some blood create a human body
[44:47] and step into it listen to this
[44:51] but god before the foundation of the
[44:52] world foreign that jesus would come
[44:55] the perfect lamb of god into a perfect
[44:58] cell
[44:59] that god himself created
[45:02] to bring blood into the world to offer
[45:04] that blood
[45:05] there was billions of people in the
[45:07] world maybe at the time
[45:09] that were walking around with with
[45:10] plenty of blood
[45:13] they were all they were all people they
[45:15] all had a soul
[45:17] but they couldn't die for another man
[45:19] and then come back into that man and
[45:21] make that man
[45:22] the same man that died right right
[45:26] only god can do that that's right he for
[45:28] ordained that jesus would come the
[45:30] perfect lamb of god into a perfect
[45:32] cell that god himself created to bring
[45:34] blood into the world
[45:35] to offer that blood amen i love that
[45:39] what a plan of redemption
[45:41] listen it can't go wrong when you're the
[45:43] one handling the whole thing
[45:45] jesus was in total control god was in
[45:47] total control even at calvary
[45:49] jesus was in total control he says into
[45:51] thy hands i
[45:53] commend my spirit they didn't kill him
[45:55] at calvary he gave up the ghost the
[45:57] bible says
[45:58] amen he was in total control over the
[46:00] whole thing
[46:02] everybody right with that amen
[46:06] let's look in isaiah 7 verse 14. let's
[46:08] skip through the
[46:09] quote there on fellowship we all know
[46:11] that jehovah
[46:12] was a crying baby we know that god came
[46:14] with no teeth that god had to
[46:16] live over a manure pile when he was born
[46:19] we know that
[46:20] but watch this but it's fulfilling the
[46:22] old testament therefore the lord himself
[46:24] shall give you a sign behold
[46:26] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[46:28] and shall call his name
[46:30] emmanuel and we know that what in isaiah
[46:33] 53 verse 1
[46:35] this is a wonderful scripture because it
[46:36] all it only talks to one man
[46:39] jesus christ doesn't talk to nobody else
[46:41] talks to jesus christ
[46:42] who hath believed i reported to whom is
[46:44] the arm of the lord revealed
[46:46] for he shall grow up before him as a
[46:48] tender plant as a root out of dry ground
[46:50] he has no form or commonness and when we
[46:52] shall see him there is no beauty
[46:54] that we should desire in other words
[46:55] he's a common man he is despised and
[46:58] rejected of men
[47:01] what about a man that was the creator of
[47:03] the world
[47:05] and they hated him the whole creation
[47:08] at that time hated him all mankind
[47:12] didn't like him
[47:13] except for a few he had twelve and one
[47:15] of them was the devil
[47:17] he was despised and rejected of men a
[47:18] man of sorrow and acquainted with grief
[47:22] if you ever get to wise you will as you
[47:23] would read the scripture
[47:25] okay you didn't go through nothing this
[47:27] man went through
[47:29] free nothing you didn't go through
[47:31] nothing this man went through for you
[47:33] he gave his life and then that life we
[47:35] know now that being almighty god that
[47:36] life can be transferred
[47:38] inside of me and you and that we could
[47:40] be as donny was we're reading this
[47:42] morning we can have the mind of christ
[47:43] you can't have the mind of christ unless
[47:45] you've got christ inside of you
[47:47] that's pretty simple surely he has borne
[47:50] our grief and carried our sorrow yet we
[47:52] did esteem him stricken smitten of god
[47:53] and afflicted
[47:55] but he was wounded for wade dale's
[47:57] transgression
[47:58] he was bruised for way dale's iniquity
[48:00] the chastisement of way dale's peace was
[48:02] upon him and with his stripes way they
[48:03] was healed can you read it like that
[48:06] amen how personal is that
[48:09] he sent him to me he didn't send him to
[48:10] you
[48:12] he's he come to get me he didn't come to
[48:14] get you david's he didn't come get you
[48:16] you come get me but you got to realize
[48:18] he came to get you
[48:19] okay he got a real life make it personal
[48:22] all we like sheep have gone astray and
[48:24] we've turned everyone to his own way and
[48:25] the lord
[48:26] has laid on him the iniquity of us all
[48:30] he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he
[48:31] opened not his mouth
[48:33] he didn't have a very nice life did he
[48:35] earthly life but you know what he didn't
[48:37] come down here for himself he came down
[48:38] here from me and you
[48:40] he came down here knowing that blood was
[48:42] going to have to be be shed
[48:43] and he was not to be slaughtered like a
[48:46] lamb he was brought as a lamb to the
[48:47] slaughter
[48:48] as a sheep before her shear is dumb so
[48:50] he opened not his mouth he was taken
[48:51] from prison and from judgment
[48:53] and who shall declare his generation for
[48:56] he was cut off
[48:57] from the land of the living
[49:00] in other words he never had any earthly
[49:02] progeny he have never had an earthly
[49:05] genealogy when they hung him on the
[49:07] cross that was it
[49:09] man thought they had done away with him
[49:10] there was no way he could have a
[49:12] son that would raise up somewhere you
[49:14] know you read the bible where you have
[49:16] these kings you know and the kings have
[49:17] 15 or 20 kids
[49:19] and then one of them goes running off
[49:20] somewhere in exile or two or three go
[49:22] running off over here
[49:23] and then they come in and kill the king
[49:25] well all of a sudden here pops up the
[49:26] sun
[49:27] you know or he'll pop up with another
[49:28] son or here pops up another one you know
[49:30] but not this one
[49:32] because his earthly genealogy was not
[49:34] what he was looking for
[49:36] it was a heavenly genealogy it was a
[49:38] genealogy that was inside of him
[49:40] of his soul not his body
[49:44] because he gave his soul
[49:47] he made his grave with the wicked we'll
[49:48] read it right here verse 10. yet it
[49:50] please the lord to bruise him he hath
[49:51] put him into grief
[49:52] when thou shalt make his soul an
[49:54] offering for sin
[49:55] he shall see his seed see that's where
[49:57] we were we were
[49:58] we were his progeny by by not by
[50:02] man's loins we were his progeny by
[50:04] spoken word by the eternal life that was
[50:06] inside of him
[50:08] part of you today was inside of that man
[50:10] at calvary amen
[50:12] part of you was inside of that man when
[50:13] he went to hell
[50:15] and then on the day of pentecost he
[50:16] released part of that and he began
[50:18] having children
[50:19] and now look the church full of children
[50:21] today by what by the spoken word is the
[50:24] original seed
[50:25] not the other part when thou shalt make
[50:28] his soul an offering for sin he shall
[50:29] see his seed
[50:30] what a wonderful plan he shall prolong
[50:33] his days and the pleasure of the lord
[50:34] shall prosper in his hand
[50:36] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[50:38] and shall be satisfied
[50:40] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[50:41] servant justify many for he shall bear
[50:44] their iniquities now look therefore will
[50:46] i divide him a portion with the grape
[50:48] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[50:50] strong because he what he poured out his
[50:52] soul
[50:53] unto death and he was numbered with
[50:54] transgression and he bear the sin of
[50:56] many
[50:56] and made intercession for the
[50:59] transgressors now remember when he came
[51:00] down here
[51:02] according to john 1 it says in the
[51:04] beginning was the word word was a big
[51:06] god and the word was god
[51:07] same was in the beginning with god let's
[51:09] go down to verse 11 save time
[51:11] he came into his own and his own
[51:12] received him not
[51:14] everybody with me but as many as
[51:18] received him
[51:19] to them gave he power to become the sons
[51:22] of god so it was for anybody
[51:24] even to them that believe on his name
[51:26] but remember we read
[51:28] here in jeremiah where he
[51:31] jeremiah 3 verse 8 says i saw when all
[51:33] the calls were by backsliding israel
[51:35] committed
[51:36] adultery i had put her away and give her
[51:39] a bill of divorcement
[51:41] they had went backsliding in the old
[51:44] testament so what did god do
[51:45] he put israel away israel was his first
[51:48] bride israel was the one he was supposed
[51:49] to come and get
[51:50] they were looking for the messiah
[51:55] and they weren't looking for a second
[51:57] person of a trinity either
[51:58] they knew that that jehovah then had
[52:00] went through the old testament
[52:02] and took the children of israel through
[52:04] the same jehovah that was going to come
[52:05] back
[52:06] amen that's why it's going to be so easy
[52:09] er for the 144 000 to see him over there
[52:11] because they believe in one god they
[52:13] don't have this trinitarian idea like we
[52:14] do here in the united states
[52:16] amen but jeremiah says
[52:20] i gave her a bill of divorcement romans
[52:23] 11 verse 25 now
[52:24] if you put her away he can't marry her
[52:26] as a bride again we're back to marriage
[52:28] in divorce
[52:29] he can't marry her again he's already
[52:31] put her away
[52:33] he can't marry her but he can marry
[52:34] another because you put his wife away he
[52:37] can marry
[52:37] again because of the adultery that she
[52:40] committed
[52:41] for i would not brethren that you should
[52:42] be ignorant of this mystery
[52:44] that you should be wise in your own
[52:45] conceit if blindness in part has
[52:47] happened to israel
[52:48] until the fullness of the gentiles be
[52:51] come in
[52:52] but now look and so all israel shall be
[52:54] saved now remember not every person
[52:57] right we know that not every person
[53:00] as it is written there shall come out of
[53:02] zion the deliverance shall turn away
[53:03] ungodliness from jacob
[53:06] for this is my covenant unto them when i
[53:09] shall take away their sins that's the
[53:10] daniel 70 weeks that we've been on
[53:13] for years and years and years that's
[53:15] very important to the jews
[53:17] it's important to us to know what's
[53:18] going on but it's very important to them
[53:21] because that's what god said he said 70
[53:23] weeks are determined you're going to get
[53:24] 70 weeks or 70
[53:26] times 7 490 years to come to repentance
[53:30] now the gentiles he's given us 2 000
[53:32] years
[53:33] and we'll cover that in just a second
[53:36] for this is my covenant unto them when i
[53:38] shall take away their sins see he's
[53:39] going to
[53:40] he's going to save 144 000 when we get
[53:42] out of here
[53:43] gloria everybody got that as concerning
[53:46] the gospel though look they are enemies
[53:48] for your sake
[53:49] they hate us we're gentiles we're dogs
[53:53] we don't know anything about this
[53:54] jehovah god that they're talking about
[53:56] we don't know anything about this
[53:57] messiah that's coming right but the
[54:00] blindness that's why god had to
[54:02] literally
[54:03] blind the eyes of the jews so that you
[54:06] and i could come in
[54:07] amen he literally covered their eyes up
[54:10] and said
[54:10] i you i can't marry you again i've got
[54:13] to find a bride
[54:16] i can't marry you but i'm not going to
[54:18] forget you look as concerning the gospel
[54:21] they are enemies for your sake talking
[54:23] to gentiles
[54:25] but as touching the election they are
[54:28] beloved for the father's sake he can't
[54:30] forget him
[54:32] but there's going to be a gap in there
[54:34] that we're going to come to in just a
[54:35] second
[54:37] and in that gap it's going to be
[54:41] me and you he's going to take a gentile
[54:44] bride because listen if it wasn't for
[54:46] the gentiles coming in
[54:48] and the promise of the gentiles coming
[54:49] in daniel 70 weeks would already be
[54:52] over because 70 weeks are determined and
[54:55] then we know when it started but what
[54:57] happened at calvary
[54:58] when he was cut off as isaiah 53 says
[55:01] cut off
[55:02] when his when he was cut off from the
[55:05] land of the living
[55:07] he didn't come back to save all the jews
[55:10] again he came back to get a gentile
[55:12] bribe
[55:12] all right everybody got that same man
[55:16] all right let's read daniel 9 verse 21
[55:21] that's why it's so important that we see
[55:24] daniel 70 weeks
[55:26] that you and i are are included in this
[55:28] and it's part of the eternal plan of
[55:30] redemption
[55:31] okay they're part of it but you and i
[55:34] are part of it too
[55:35] and we'll show it to you in just a
[55:36] second how that works
[55:38] daniel says yes while i was speaking in
[55:40] prayer
[55:41] even the man gabriel whom i had seen in
[55:43] the vision at the beginning being caused
[55:45] to fly swiftly touched me about the time
[55:47] of the evening oblation
[55:48] anybody good with that he was praying
[55:52] and something happened
[55:56] and he informed me and talked to me and
[55:57] said oh daniel i am now come
[55:59] forth to give this skill and
[56:01] understanding at the beginning of thy
[56:02] suffocation the commandment came forth
[56:05] and i am come to show thee for thou art
[56:07] greatly beloved
[56:08] therefore understand the matter and
[56:10] consider the vision
[56:11] and what was daniel praying for let me
[56:13] just give you a background if you don't
[56:15] know what daniel was praying for
[56:16] daniel was saying god we have been in
[56:19] captivity for 68 years
[56:21] in two more years we're going to go free
[56:25] what's going to happen what's going to
[56:27] happen to us
[56:28] that's right well god's going to tell
[56:30] him you're going to get a release
[56:32] there's a king that's going to give you
[56:34] an edict that's going to say you can go
[56:35] back to jerusalem and start building
[56:37] your city
[56:38] and then i'm going to come but see they
[56:40] didn't believe
[56:41] that jesus was a messiah so you got to
[56:43] be careful with that so now look
[56:45] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[56:49] and upon thy holy city so listen god not
[56:51] only
[56:52] listen we have no continuing city
[56:54] abraham is our father
[56:56] abraham was not a jew
[57:02] no abraham was not a jew he was a
[57:04] wanderer
[57:06] he wasn't jewish the father of our faith
[57:11] they talk about him all the time but he
[57:12] really wasn't so but watch
[57:14] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[57:16] and the city so god's going to give them
[57:18] a city
[57:19] to live in according to ezekiel 40
[57:21] through 44 the
[57:23] only city me and you are promised is the
[57:24] one in revelations 20 whatever it is 21
[57:27] or 22.
[57:28] when that city comes down out of heaven
[57:30] and sits over there in jerusalem
[57:32] that's our future home that's where we
[57:34] live that's not where the jews are going
[57:35] to live
[57:36] that's right and during the
[57:37] thousand-year millennial reign
[57:39] they're going to build a temple and
[57:41] they're going to live in that temple
[57:42] because they're temple builders
[57:46] remember when you die you don't lose
[57:47] anything you just travel to another
[57:49] place
[57:52] so 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[57:54] people now what is daniel's people
[57:56] though they're jews
[57:58] and thy holy city which is what
[58:00] jerusalem
[58:01] to do six things to finish the
[58:03] transgression make an end of sins to
[58:05] make reconciliation for iniquity
[58:07] in other words he's going to save them
[58:09] the same way he saved you
[58:11] through justification sanctification in
[58:13] the baptism of the holy ghost he's going
[58:14] to save them just like he's going to
[58:16] save you
[58:16] but they will not be bribed they've lost
[58:18] that part of being bride
[58:22] they will be eunuchs or they will be
[58:25] temple subjects but they will never be
[58:27] bribed
[58:28] but he's not ever going to forget them
[58:29] either make reconciliation for iniquity
[58:32] bringing everlasting righteousness seal
[58:34] up the vision and prophecy and anoint
[58:36] the most holy
[58:37] look know therefore and understand it
[58:38] from the going forth of commandment
[58:40] to restore and build jerusalem so
[58:42] they're getting ready to leave wherever
[58:43] they're in captive in egypt or wherever
[58:45] they are
[58:46] and they're getting ready to go but
[58:47] remember you've got to have to travel
[58:49] from here to there you've got to have a
[58:51] some paperwork you got to have cyrus or
[58:55] darius or one of those kings to write
[58:57] you and eat it
[58:58] it says okay you can go rebuild your
[59:00] your temple
[59:01] you have my protection and you have my
[59:04] paperwork
[59:05] go build it well they started to do that
[59:06] and we've been through daniel 70 weeks
[59:08] with all the numbers
[59:10] but if you'll just read your bible right
[59:13] your bible tells you exactly what's
[59:17] going on right
[59:18] okay there's so much contention in the
[59:21] message of the hour about what brother
[59:23] branham said
[59:24] they just have never been taught right
[59:27] amen
[59:29] hey man they just never been taught
[59:31] right
[59:32] because you can't go against the bible
[59:35] right and the prophet never wins then
[59:37] you went against the bible
[59:38] so it's got to connect know therefore
[59:42] and understand it from the going forth
[59:43] or the commandment to restore and build
[59:45] jerusalem because remember it's to the
[59:46] people and the city
[59:49] everybody okay with that unto messiah
[59:52] the prince shall be
[59:53] seven weeks and three score in two weeks
[59:56] the street shall be built again in the
[59:57] wall
[59:58] even in trouble it's time if you'll read
[1:00:00] over there in habakkuk or somewhere
[1:00:02] they had a trial in one hand and they
[1:00:03] were building the wall and they had a
[1:00:05] sword in this hand because listen
[1:00:07] those people that lived around them knew
[1:00:09] if they got that temple built back again
[1:00:12] that god would be with them again so
[1:00:15] they took
[1:00:15] all they could and they would go and
[1:00:17] bombard that place
[1:00:19] trying to get that place broken back
[1:00:22] down again because they knew that
[1:00:23] the jews needed that temple bill and
[1:00:26] they finally got it finished but listen
[1:00:28] and after three score in two weeks shall
[1:00:31] messiah be cut off but not for himself
[1:00:33] now why was he cut off
[1:00:35] wasn't cut off for himself if you would
[1:00:37] pull that chart up
[1:00:38] please brother joe i missed the first
[1:00:40] one brother anderson sorry the second
[1:00:42] one the daniel 70 wheat one
[1:00:44] for those of you that have not been here
[1:00:46] we're doing this eternal redemption we
[1:00:48] started way before
[1:00:50] time and we had a timeline but this is
[1:00:52] the one
[1:00:53] and and brother bob did this
[1:00:57] so it and you know what to an untrained
[1:01:00] eye it looks a little confusing but uh
[1:01:01] most of us it looks beautiful because we
[1:01:03] know what it's saying
[1:01:04] all right so the the bible tells us
[1:01:07] that it would be seven weeks and 62
[1:01:11] weeks now is that the bible
[1:01:13] read your bible if you don't look down
[1:01:15] six seven weeks and 62 weeks
[1:01:17] what's 62 plus seven 69
[1:01:22] no half weeks
[1:01:26] one more time seven i'm reading bible
[1:01:30] seven weeks and 62 weeks that's
[1:01:33] 69 and then messiah will be cut off
[1:01:36] according to isaiah 53 he was killed
[1:01:40] at calvary in a.d
[1:01:43] 30. right everybody got that right
[1:01:46] no half weeks in here nope
[1:01:50] no half weeks because the big contention
[1:01:53] is is we've already had three and a half
[1:01:54] weeks and only three and a half weeks
[1:01:55] after the rapture
[1:01:56] well that's a lie that's right and i'll
[1:01:59] tell anybody who teaches this a lot
[1:02:03] anybody i don't care who it is because
[1:02:05] my bible says if you'll keep reading the
[1:02:06] bible says
[1:02:08] and after three score in two weeks shall
[1:02:10] messiah
[1:02:11] be cut off but not for himself why was
[1:02:14] he cut off for
[1:02:15] me and you then
[1:02:20] he shall destroy the city remember titus
[1:02:22] in 1870 destroyed the city right here
[1:02:26] everybody got that and the sanctuary and
[1:02:28] the end thereof shall be with the flood
[1:02:30] until the end of the war desolations are
[1:02:31] returned
[1:02:32] determine and he shall confirm the
[1:02:34] covenant with many for one week now if
[1:02:36] we've had 69
[1:02:40] according to the bible we've had 69
[1:02:43] weeks to messiah
[1:02:45] then that this this gentile dispensation
[1:02:47] does not count anywhere
[1:02:49] in jewish time right right
[1:02:53] now go that way
[1:02:57] there's one week left after the rapture
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:00] according to the bible he said no
[1:03:03] brother brown said three and a half
[1:03:04] you're not you don't know what he's
[1:03:05] saying right you don't know what he's
[1:03:07] talking about
[1:03:08] that's right we do because we've been
[1:03:09] taught well there's a messiah week of
[1:03:12] seven years three and a half here
[1:03:13] three and a half here but that three and
[1:03:15] a half is right here right right
[1:03:17] then you have the tribulation the bible
[1:03:19] tells us every bit of this it goes
[1:03:21] through because look
[1:03:22] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:03:24] many for one week that's the 70th week
[1:03:27] now who is the he
[1:03:31] he shall confirm jesus didn't make this
[1:03:34] covenant to break it jesus does not make
[1:03:35] a covenant to break one
[1:03:37] right who makes covenants and breaks
[1:03:39] them the devil
[1:03:42] the prophet of god says that he is the
[1:03:45] antichrist
[1:03:47] the pope the whoever you all want to
[1:03:49] call it and you know what
[1:03:50] you and i are not here when that treaty
[1:03:52] signed right so we're gone in a rapture
[1:03:55] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:03:57] many for one week
[1:03:59] and in the midst of the week
[1:04:04] what's myth middle after the prophets
[1:04:07] preached three and a half years
[1:04:10] there's going to be he's going to cause
[1:04:13] a sacrifice and oblation to cease and
[1:04:15] for the over spreading of abomination he
[1:04:16] shall make it desolate
[1:04:18] even unto the consummation and that
[1:04:21] determined shall be poured out upon the
[1:04:23] desolate
[1:04:24] listen the great tribulation is going to
[1:04:26] be man pushing buttons and killing
[1:04:28] people by atomic weapons not god
[1:04:32] god's going to allow it to happen but
[1:04:34] there'll be no listen after the 144
[1:04:36] thousand going to rapture
[1:04:37] there's nothing here but demons there's
[1:04:40] no god here to save anybody there's no
[1:04:43] salvation for anybody
[1:04:45] you've got to die during this great
[1:04:46] tribulation and then what happens in
[1:04:48] ezekiel 40 to 44
[1:04:50] there is a temple built he said i got
[1:04:55] find me somewhere in the bible where it
[1:04:57] says the wedding supper's three and a
[1:04:59] half years
[1:05:03] it's not in there
[1:05:07] it says the wedding supper of the lamb
[1:05:09] the prophet of god is telling you though
[1:05:11] that we're going to be gone right right
[1:05:14] here
[1:05:16] we're going to be gone in another
[1:05:18] dimension glory
[1:05:20] while this 144th listen we can't be here
[1:05:22] at the same time
[1:05:24] we got to be gone out of the way and
[1:05:26] then he's going to come back and preach
[1:05:28] 300
[1:05:28] 3 and a half years 1260 days they're
[1:05:31] going to take a rapture
[1:05:32] and whatever else happens after that
[1:05:34] folks it doesn't matter to me
[1:05:36] we're in glorified bodies right here
[1:05:42] we shall confirm the covenant with many
[1:05:44] for one week that finishes
[1:05:46] because remember what is god doing in
[1:05:48] the 70 weeks of daniel he's restoring
[1:05:51] the salvation of israel and the city
[1:05:57] so he's going to build that city back
[1:05:59] right here
[1:06:00] the temple that we're going to live in
[1:06:03] in the millennium
[1:06:06] for a thousand years but remember that
[1:06:07] thousand years is not for me and you
[1:06:10] yeah that's right right
[1:06:14] that's not a gentile listen why do we
[1:06:17] need a thousand years
[1:06:19] to prove we're gonna prove the sin curse
[1:06:21] is done right here
[1:06:23] hey man we're gonna prove it right here
[1:06:26] the same curse when you take a glorified
[1:06:28] body
[1:06:28] your sin curse is over glory and then
[1:06:31] we're going up here somewhere it doesn't
[1:06:33] matter to me
[1:06:34] but we're coming right back down here
[1:06:36] and we're just going to have what the
[1:06:38] prophet god tell us
[1:06:39] a honeymoon now does your wife work on a
[1:06:42] honeymoon no obviously you have fun
[1:06:46] during the honeymoon
[1:06:48] we're gonna have fun for that thousand
[1:06:49] years but somebody is gonna live that
[1:06:52] thousand years to prove the sin curse is
[1:06:54] over for that part of the world
[1:06:56] or for this part of what's coming out
[1:06:57] here anybody got that
[1:06:59] amen that's really simple if you want
[1:07:01] this chart uh
[1:07:02] it's about that big if you want it but
[1:07:05] but it's really neat how brother bob we
[1:07:07] kind of all got together
[1:07:09] and put all this together and it's it's
[1:07:11] wonderful if you know what you're
[1:07:13] talking about see
[1:07:14] see because the contention remember when
[1:07:17] remember this
[1:07:18] there was two things when the people
[1:07:21] started leaving the message there was
[1:07:23] two doctrines
[1:07:25] there was two things that they
[1:07:27] questioned
[1:07:28] brother brad ramon one was the cloud
[1:07:31] and the next one was daniel 71 they said
[1:07:34] he was wrong he was wrong he was wrong
[1:07:36] he was wrong
[1:07:38] well you know what they're wrong
[1:07:44] because my bible says that my bible says
[1:07:47] that 69 weeks has already happened
[1:07:50] and he was cut off for a 2000 year
[1:07:54] gentile dispensation and i went to
[1:07:57] school and i went to a little bit of
[1:07:58] college 69 plus one is what
[1:08:01] 70.
[1:08:05] that's why it's called 70th week not
[1:08:08] half weeks
[1:08:10] now there's only three and a half years
[1:08:12] of jesus ministry left because he's
[1:08:13] already preached three and a half here
[1:08:15] but that three and a half year ministry
[1:08:17] of jesus is right here he don't preach
[1:08:18] right here
[1:08:21] listen that is the wrath of god the
[1:08:22] destruction of man as we know it they
[1:08:25] are going to bomb each other to death
[1:08:29] the rocks are going to cry for them to
[1:08:30] fall on them and all these things
[1:08:33] you just don't want to be here that's
[1:08:34] right but no ma'am
[1:08:36] no sir the prophet of god wasn't wrong
[1:08:39] if anybody's wrong we're wrong
[1:08:41] right amen but
[1:08:44] the prophet of god told us face final
[1:08:46] resting place is in the word of god
[1:08:47] right everything you see and you if you
[1:08:51] see something that you think
[1:08:53] looks wrong that the prophet said or you
[1:08:55] read in the bible
[1:08:56] go to the bible and say god i need to
[1:08:59] know
[1:09:00] that's right and here we go again if
[1:09:03] you're born again
[1:09:04] he's obligated to talk to you if you're
[1:09:06] not he's not obligated to talk to you
[1:09:08] you'll be so confused to you know what
[1:09:11] you'll leave the message
[1:09:12] and you'll prove you're not born again
[1:09:15] just
[1:09:15] sorry simple as that it's time when we
[1:09:19] go quit playing
[1:09:22] you better believe this is the truth
[1:09:25] or god better hurry up and send you
[1:09:27] somebody else real quick
[1:09:29] because there's a lot of prophecy in the
[1:09:31] bible that's been fulfilled
[1:09:34] right now
[1:09:40] but remember when this man was cut off
[1:09:43] he's coming back in two witnesses but he
[1:09:46] sent
[1:09:46] john to the isle of patmos but let's
[1:09:50] read luke 24 46
[1:09:55] jesus said unto them thus it is written
[1:09:58] and thus it behooved christ to suffer
[1:10:00] and derives from the dead the third day
[1:10:05] and that repentance and remission of sin
[1:10:07] should be preached in his name among all
[1:10:09] nations
[1:10:10] beginning at jerusalem we know that the
[1:10:12] first part of
[1:10:13] of this holy ghost falling was on 120
[1:10:16] jews but remember we read last week we
[1:10:18] read it again
[1:10:19] there were thousands downstairs 3 000 of
[1:10:22] gentiles you don't see that
[1:10:25] people don't read that far but you got
[1:10:27] to read that far that repentance and
[1:10:29] remission of sin should be preached in
[1:10:30] his name
[1:10:31] among all nations beginning at jerusalem
[1:10:33] and you are witnesses
[1:10:36] of these same things now watch and
[1:10:38] behold i send the promise of my father
[1:10:40] upon you
[1:10:42] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[1:10:45] until you be
[1:10:46] endued with power
[1:10:49] from on high now that word in dude means
[1:10:52] listen to this
[1:10:54] go up to the go to the next one strong
[1:10:56] concordance
[1:10:58] what happened on the day of pentecost
[1:11:01] 120 licks of fire yeah sunk into them
[1:11:05] people
[1:11:06] right it didn't it didn't fall on them
[1:11:09] it fell in them
[1:11:10] amen amen to put on clothes with
[1:11:13] clothes in a radiant or to sink into i
[1:11:16] like that
[1:11:17] there's the sense of sinking into a
[1:11:19] garment it didn't sink into a garment
[1:11:21] it sunk into human flesh and that's
[1:11:23] where jesus stood up and he said oh this
[1:11:25] is what i've waited on
[1:11:27] he said i told you to go to jerusalem
[1:11:28] and you'll be endued with what dunamis
[1:11:31] or power from on high
[1:11:34] to sink into i like that that little
[1:11:37] tongue of fire didn't stay with him the
[1:11:39] whole time it just disappeared brother
[1:11:40] paul
[1:11:41] went right down inside of him and it
[1:11:43] birthed 120 little jesus into the body
[1:11:46] of christ
[1:11:47] and there was the body that got started
[1:11:49] all right let's read this real quick
[1:11:50] acts 2 verse 1. that's where we're going
[1:11:52] to
[1:11:54] we're gonna look and see here and when
[1:11:56] the day of pentecost
[1:11:58] was fully come there was all with one
[1:11:59] accord in one place
[1:12:01] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:12:02] as of a rushing mighty wind
[1:12:04] and it filled all the house where they
[1:12:06] were sitting and they appeared unto them
[1:12:09] cloven tongues like is a fire and it sat
[1:12:11] upon each one
[1:12:12] and they were filled with the holy ghost
[1:12:15] and began to speak with other tongues as
[1:12:17] the spirit gave them utterance
[1:12:18] and there was dwelling in jerusalem jews
[1:12:20] devout men out of every nation under
[1:12:22] heaven
[1:12:23] now when this was noise abroad the
[1:12:24] multitude came together and was
[1:12:25] confounded because
[1:12:26] every man heard them speak in his own
[1:12:28] language and they were all amazed in
[1:12:30] marvel saying one to another behold or
[1:12:32] not all these would speak galilean
[1:12:34] and how hear we every man in our own
[1:12:36] language you see they weren't speaking
[1:12:38] in tongues
[1:12:39] they were speaking in their own language
[1:12:40] but you were hearing them in your
[1:12:42] language the same thing is going to
[1:12:43] happen
[1:12:44] we're not going to need an interpreter
[1:12:46] in the future home
[1:12:49] you're going to speak english and
[1:12:50] whatever nationality they can't
[1:12:52] other people come from they're going to
[1:12:53] hear it in their in their language
[1:12:58] thank god and how here we every man in
[1:13:01] our own language when we were born
[1:13:03] parthians medes elomites dwellers in
[1:13:06] mesopotamia
[1:13:07] judea cappadocia upon us asia
[1:13:10] pergya pampalia all the way down into
[1:13:12] egypt
[1:13:13] libya cyrene about cyrene and strangers
[1:13:17] of rome jews and proselytes
[1:13:20] cretes and arabians do we do hear them
[1:13:22] speak in our tongue
[1:13:24] the wonderful works of god so after that
[1:13:26] day
[1:13:27] there was a gentile dispensation started
[1:13:30] three thousand people went out
[1:13:31] and proclaimed the gospel of god we
[1:13:34] don't know their names and it really
[1:13:35] doesn't matter god knows who they are
[1:13:37] but they spoke a language that the
[1:13:39] people had never heard before
[1:13:41] and then paul being the first church age
[1:13:43] messenger established the first
[1:13:45] church because of a promise now we know
[1:13:48] that that we
[1:13:49] we know that he went to the isle of
[1:13:50] patmos john did
[1:13:52] after paul had already died
[1:13:56] is everybody okay with that paul died in
[1:13:58] 80 50 something it was 80 90.
[1:14:00] but what was god doing god was showing
[1:14:04] john what was going to happen
[1:14:08] during the church ages and that's where
[1:14:10] i'm going to base this right here
[1:14:13] of what i'm going to speak right here
[1:14:14] just for just a few minutes
[1:14:16] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[1:14:18] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[1:14:20] a trumpet
[1:14:21] saying i am alpha and omega the first
[1:14:23] and the last
[1:14:24] and what thou seest write in the book
[1:14:26] and send it to the seven churches now
[1:14:29] you say oh
[1:14:30] there was only seven churches now if
[1:14:32] there was only seven
[1:14:34] buildings
[1:14:37] yeah how far would that go
[1:14:41] no it was seven church ages it was seven
[1:14:43] churches right the people that were
[1:14:44] established in these churches
[1:14:46] it wasn't to just one little church
[1:14:50] send it to the seven churches which are
[1:14:52] in asia and to ephesus smyrna
[1:14:54] because see there are if you're regis
[1:14:55] church age book these are literal cities
[1:14:58] but they had a characteristic that each
[1:15:00] age had
[1:15:01] coming down through here and it what
[1:15:03] coincided with the messenger to that age
[1:15:06] okay because if
[1:15:09] listen if it wasn't revelations 1 10
[1:15:12] through 20
[1:15:14] and most people in denominational world
[1:15:15] don't even care about this it's just it
[1:15:17] was really too just a church and it was
[1:15:18] just a
[1:15:19] letter and it was just because they you
[1:15:21] know they they don't like that man thing
[1:15:24] even though wesley was the founder of
[1:15:27] the methodist church and
[1:15:28] luther of the lutheran church and all
[1:15:30] these different ones they have a problem
[1:15:32] with that
[1:15:32] we were talking about that one time in a
[1:15:34] methodist church they had asked me to
[1:15:35] speak and
[1:15:37] dad was there and one of our cousins
[1:15:39] walked up and said what do you mean
[1:15:41] when you talk about this martin luther
[1:15:42] and john wesley and all that stuff and
[1:15:44] and then i think dad's brother said well
[1:15:46] they just they're just man followers
[1:15:48] you know so and that's okay i started
[1:15:51] with me i don't care
[1:15:53] it didn't bother me it made me say lord
[1:15:56] help that blind person standing there
[1:16:00] but thank god he sent us a prophet but
[1:16:02] the reason he sent us a prophet is
[1:16:03] because of this right here
[1:16:05] because he promised us seven messengers
[1:16:08] with seven distinct
[1:16:09] different messages this is my point from
[1:16:12] today
[1:16:13] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[1:16:15] with me and being turned i saw seven
[1:16:16] golden candlesticks
[1:16:18] and in the midst of the seven
[1:16:19] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[1:16:22] man
[1:16:23] that's god in human flesh likened to the
[1:16:26] son of man but he was clothed with a
[1:16:28] garment down to the foot and gird about
[1:16:29] the paps with the golden girdle
[1:16:31] john was looking at this man he knew
[1:16:33] that was jesus he'd seen jesus
[1:16:35] he'd seen him in his lifetime in his
[1:16:37] literal lifetime he had seen him
[1:16:39] but now he sees jesus standing there
[1:16:41] clothed
[1:16:42] differently than when he was then why
[1:16:44] because he wasn't in bribe form then
[1:16:48] he was in jesus the savior for him then
[1:16:50] he was in what he was the son of man
[1:16:52] but now john sees this son of man
[1:16:54] standing in the midst of
[1:16:56] seven candlesticks and he's got a golden
[1:16:59] girdle
[1:17:00] dressed feminish bright form right
[1:17:04] so now it must click to john
[1:17:09] there's been an in morphing there's been
[1:17:11] a there's been a little bit of a change
[1:17:13] here now we've not got this man
[1:17:15] one man standing here we now have got
[1:17:18] one man standing in the midst of seven
[1:17:20] candlesticks
[1:17:21] and then that person listen to this
[1:17:25] saw one like into the sunny man glo
[1:17:27] close the garment down to the foot sorry
[1:17:30] i'm trying to get too fast gert about
[1:17:31] the pabst with the golden girdle
[1:17:32] his head and his hair was white as well
[1:17:34] now remember
[1:17:36] the prophet god explains to us that is
[1:17:38] what the judgment form the judge form
[1:17:40] he's in judge
[1:17:42] because who's going to judge the earth
[1:17:44] the saints right
[1:17:46] from from the church from when the first
[1:17:48] church started in ephesus
[1:17:50] to this church age there's your judge
[1:17:53] there's your judgment and his head and
[1:17:56] his hair was white like wall as white as
[1:17:58] snow in his eyes where his flames of
[1:17:59] fire and his feet was fine brass
[1:18:01] if they burned it in the furnace and his
[1:18:03] voice is the sound of many waters
[1:18:05] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[1:18:07] now look here's my promise
[1:18:11] god's going to send me a messenger
[1:18:16] he had his right hand seven stars and
[1:18:18] out of his mouth
[1:18:19] went what a two-edged sharp two-edged
[1:18:22] sword
[1:18:22] the word and his countenance was as the
[1:18:25] sun shines in his strength
[1:18:26] and when i first saw him i fell at my
[1:18:29] feet is dead and he laid his right hand
[1:18:30] upon me saying fear not
[1:18:32] i am the first and the last i am he that
[1:18:35] liveth in with dead and behold i am
[1:18:37] alive forevermore
[1:18:39] amen and have the keys of hell and of
[1:18:41] death
[1:18:43] look he's commissioning john write the
[1:18:45] things which thou has seen
[1:18:47] and the things which are and the things
[1:18:50] which shall be hereafter
[1:18:52] the mystery of the seven stars which
[1:18:53] thou sawest in my hand
[1:18:57] they were in the hand of the son of man
[1:18:58] now he was standing in front of seven
[1:19:00] golden candle sticks which is the seven
[1:19:02] church ages right
[1:19:03] but then he had a special something in
[1:19:05] his hand
[1:19:07] seven stars in my right hand
[1:19:10] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[1:19:13] seven stars are the angels of the seven
[1:19:15] church ages and the seven candlesticks
[1:19:18] what's thou saw us
[1:19:20] are the seven churches right
[1:19:23] now let's go to the greek lexicon this
[1:19:24] will be the last one to watch
[1:19:27] what is that star mean it's a messenger
[1:19:30] from god
[1:19:34] god had seven distinct different
[1:19:37] messengers in his hand
[1:19:41] so here's my contention if brother
[1:19:44] branham's not that seventh star
[1:19:47] god needs to send me one
[1:19:50] because he promised i'd have one in this
[1:19:53] last church age he promised me he had
[1:19:55] him in his hand now you think god's
[1:19:56] gonna let him go
[1:19:59] he had him in his hand and he gave paul
[1:20:02] irenaeus martin columba luther
[1:20:05] wesley william brown
[1:20:08] to give us what a message
[1:20:12] now we know that this messenger though
[1:20:14] here is our issue
[1:20:16] the issue that we have no well not us
[1:20:18] but the issue that people have
[1:20:21] is they see that god may have sent
[1:20:24] us a messenger to turn our hearts back
[1:20:27] and then we're just all become
[1:20:28] pentecostal and we're just supposed to
[1:20:29] shout and praise the lord and
[1:20:31] and and then the major doctrines come up
[1:20:33] of
[1:20:35] back then like no eternal hell uh all
[1:20:37] these different things
[1:20:38] everybody got that let's just talk here
[1:20:40] for just about five minutes
[1:20:42] all right that that is that's fine
[1:20:45] that's that's
[1:20:46] malachi 4 to restore the heart
[1:20:49] the soul
[1:20:53] the heart the soul to return our soul
[1:20:55] back
[1:20:56] to the faith of the fathers which was
[1:20:59] the original preaching
[1:21:00] of the first church age that's right
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:04] everybody got that amen they didn't have
[1:21:07] an eternal hell
[1:21:08] message they didn't have a three god
[1:21:11] message they didn't have a baptism in
[1:21:12] the name of the father son holy ghost
[1:21:14] message they didn't have any of those
[1:21:15] messages
[1:21:17] that wasn't in their repertoire they
[1:21:19] didn't have even have notes for that
[1:21:23] amen but down to the church ages though
[1:21:27] man had eroded
[1:21:30] the messages that these preachers
[1:21:32] brought right
[1:21:33] maybe not so much during the time but
[1:21:35] shortly after they left
[1:21:37] they started eating again remember
[1:21:39] talking about restoration of the broad
[1:21:40] tree
[1:21:41] the devil started eating that what he
[1:21:43] can't eat the word away but it can eat
[1:21:45] the effect that it has
[1:21:46] right so the effect that it had during
[1:21:48] the church ages was
[1:21:50] that you believed and then you died
[1:21:56] luther was a trinitarian wesley was a
[1:21:58] trinitarian
[1:22:00] this last messenger was not a
[1:22:01] trinitarian but now
[1:22:04] we we love the first part where he
[1:22:06] turned the hearts of the fathers of the
[1:22:07] children children to the fathers
[1:22:09] so he turned us back babbling babies
[1:22:12] back to the what pentecostal to the
[1:22:14] faith of the fathers because
[1:22:15] the faith of the fathers paul peter
[1:22:18] couldn't say
[1:22:18] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[1:22:20] temperamentation god's brother kindness
[1:22:21] he had to have some of that
[1:22:24] to be able to tell us about his natural
[1:22:25] perfect man he had to have a few of
[1:22:27] those gifts
[1:22:28] or a few of those things that in his
[1:22:30] life
[1:22:32] why wouldn't peter peter was the worst
[1:22:34] one of all
[1:22:35] he knew god done something in his life
[1:22:38] he took that temperance away from him
[1:22:39] that's for sure
[1:22:41] and give him a lot more patience but
[1:22:43] then god
[1:22:44] sent we got to keep reading as i was
[1:22:47] telling brother daniel wednesday night
[1:22:50] we got to keep reading we can't stop at
[1:22:52] malachi 4.
[1:22:54] right right if we stop at malachi 4 yes
[1:22:57] he turned us back
[1:22:58] to the original faith of the fathers
[1:23:03] and that would have been it we'd had to
[1:23:05] have another church age
[1:23:07] and another messenger because god
[1:23:10] promised though
[1:23:12] in luke 17 30 that the son of man
[1:23:17] would have to return in the end time
[1:23:20] the son of man would have to be here
[1:23:22] like he was 2 000 years ago
[1:23:26] in our flesh to change this flesh
[1:23:30] so brother brown said then we look and
[1:23:32] we see and i got
[1:23:33] you just keep going you go to
[1:23:34] revelations 10 verse 7
[1:23:36] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:23:38] angel if brother brown wasn't
[1:23:39] if he wasn't the voice we need to listen
[1:23:41] to god's got to send us one
[1:23:45] or you can take him to judgment on his
[1:23:47] word and say you didn't give me a chance
[1:23:48] you didn't
[1:23:49] you lied when you said you had seven
[1:23:51] stars you only had six
[1:23:52] right no god don't lie
[1:23:56] never has never will that's right he's
[1:23:59] given us a message
[1:24:01] we've already got it why look for
[1:24:03] something else
[1:24:06] and then the prophet of god tells us in
[1:24:08] the church age book he said this
[1:24:09] messenger of malachi 4 do two things
[1:24:13] one turn the hearts back to the faith of
[1:24:15] the fathers
[1:24:16] and and reveal
[1:24:20] the seven seals or the seven thunders
[1:24:22] that's not written in the book
[1:24:24] but reveal them so that you and i can
[1:24:27] take a body change
[1:24:29] and because there's no other church age
[1:24:31] there's no other messenger to come
[1:24:33] because if you say brother branham
[1:24:34] wasn't a church aged messenger god's got
[1:24:37] to send somebody
[1:24:39] and he better do it quicker he's going
[1:24:41] to raise sodom and gomorrah and
[1:24:42] apologize to everyone over all this felt
[1:24:44] that's going on now
[1:24:47] methodist church going to have
[1:24:49] homosexuals
[1:24:51] in their pulpit
[1:24:56] brother brown said john wesley was a
[1:24:58] firebrand snatched i believe
[1:24:59] if he came back and saw that
[1:25:03] it'd be some killing yeah
[1:25:06] he'd be more in a firebrand he'd take
[1:25:08] that firebrand and beat about half of
[1:25:09] them to death
[1:25:11] but you see how far man's got it away
[1:25:13] but listen
[1:25:14] satan's trying to do that my last point
[1:25:16] satan's trying to do that in this end
[1:25:18] time in this message
[1:25:20] he's trying to discredit and i want to
[1:25:23] say this one time
[1:25:25] one time only
[1:25:28] i don't care if william branham
[1:25:32] was false in his personal life
[1:25:35] or false in he wasn't out here at a
[1:25:38] certain time
[1:25:39] or he he said 2 000 and meant 4 000.
[1:25:43] what that man when i heard his voice
[1:25:47] that was the voice of god speaking
[1:25:51] directly to me
[1:25:52] glory and as i read you in ephesians it
[1:25:55] told me
[1:25:56] the mystery of his will
[1:26:00] i do not care about all that other stuff
[1:26:02] you can have all that garbage you want
[1:26:06] i'll take my stand that he is one that i
[1:26:10] listen to the voice of and that he's
[1:26:12] going to perfect
[1:26:13] that that perfection's going to come
[1:26:14] through that voice
[1:26:16] final voice to the final age why in the
[1:26:18] world would god send
[1:26:19] a anyway there's no way
[1:26:22] there's eight manifestations of god we
[1:26:24] know that but there's only seven church
[1:26:25] age messengers
[1:26:26] there's only seven church ages only
[1:26:28] seven church age messengers
[1:26:30] but god gave us a real good one in the
[1:26:32] end time
[1:26:33] but you know what it's like brother
[1:26:34] daniel said the closer we get to god the
[1:26:37] more you're gonna they're gonna call you
[1:26:38] the devil
[1:26:40] because listen if they called god
[1:26:42] himself
[1:26:44] that was the most perfect man to walk on
[1:26:47] the face of the earth
[1:26:49] he didn't have nothing to look back on
[1:26:51] he didn't have no lineage to say well
[1:26:53] i'm sorry because grandma no
[1:26:56] he was almighty god that's right and if
[1:26:59] they called him beelzebub
[1:27:02] they called him a wine bibber they told
[1:27:04] him they said why is your
[1:27:05] why is your master why is he around all
[1:27:08] these
[1:27:08] prostitutes and and all these
[1:27:10] republicans and sinners and
[1:27:12] jesus just looked at me he said
[1:27:15] somebody's well don't need a physician
[1:27:21] a physician is needed where people are
[1:27:22] sick
[1:27:24] well let me tell you something we might
[1:27:26] and that's why i love what brother brown
[1:27:27] god sent brother brown he sent the
[1:27:29] healing message first
[1:27:30] for the body he sent the healing message
[1:27:34] for the body
[1:27:35] because there was a lot of people healed
[1:27:37] under his ministry but from 1963 to 65
[1:27:40] that's the message that's going to
[1:27:41] change mind and your body
[1:27:43] that's what's going to take us to
[1:27:44] another level and it's not going to just
[1:27:47] temporarily heal us i'm not looking for
[1:27:50] temporary healing
[1:27:51] that's great i love it but the healing
[1:27:54] of the soul is eternal
[1:27:55] it's part of this eternal plan and you
[1:27:57] and i are heading toward
[1:27:59] an eternal part in our body that's never
[1:28:02] happened before
[1:28:02] like brother donny said even jesus
[1:28:04] christ has not stood like that
[1:28:06] he had to die his body lay dead cold in
[1:28:10] the grave for two days
[1:28:12] when we take a body change ours will not
[1:28:15] have to
[1:28:16] but thank god i just read you he said
[1:28:19] i'm standing here with the keys
[1:28:21] of death and of hell he had the keys in
[1:28:24] his hand
[1:28:24] he had the seven stars in his hand and
[1:28:26] he was standing right in the midst
[1:28:28] of the seven church ages now you and i
[1:28:30] are the very end of that church age
[1:28:32] we're done we're finished it's almost
[1:28:34] over
[1:28:35] believe this message and i'm going to
[1:28:38] say it one more time
[1:28:39] if you can't understand this message you
[1:28:41] need the holy ghost
[1:28:44] that's the problem i see people are
[1:28:46] going because i shouted i've been i've
[1:28:47] got
[1:28:48] tenure
[1:28:52] for those of you that don't know what
[1:28:54] that means that means they've got vested
[1:28:57] time i've sat in a pew for 25 years and
[1:28:59] listened to brother so-and-so
[1:29:01] that don't mean squat to god you could
[1:29:04] be dead as a doornail
[1:29:09] but you get born again one time
[1:29:13] didn't god said he would give us the
[1:29:15] mystery of his will
[1:29:18] he'll not give it to the devil he can't
[1:29:21] give it to the devil's kids because they
[1:29:23] don't want it
[1:29:24] right they just want to shout and have a
[1:29:25] good time and oh this preacher he
[1:29:27] preaches so good
[1:29:28] that's okay but i want you listen if the
[1:29:31] son of man has come back into power
[1:29:33] we're going to take communion so we
[1:29:34] won't have the musicians come i was
[1:29:38] thinking about this last night we were
[1:29:39] talking about the son of man
[1:29:41] show me one time now if we look at the
[1:29:45] son of man ministry give me five minutes
[1:29:48] those of you that slept for thirty give
[1:29:49] me five more
[1:29:54] we look at this son of man ministering
[1:29:58] jesus christ never hardly
[1:30:01] ever raised his voice
[1:30:08] we think we need to have a real loud
[1:30:10] shouting meeting where we slap the
[1:30:12] people knock them down and throw them
[1:30:13] all over the place
[1:30:18] jesus walked up to legion and legion was
[1:30:20] asking him permission
[1:30:22] that devil was asking him permission to
[1:30:23] leave and jesus you know what jesus said
[1:30:26] he turned to look at him and said go boy
[1:30:31] now see a bait for the preachers in the
[1:30:33] end time they're over there grabbing him
[1:30:35] screaming and
[1:30:36] no the son of man ministry of supreme
[1:30:39] power brother brown said the most
[1:30:40] powerful
[1:30:41] anointing that ever was is when jesus
[1:30:43] walked in that temple luke four i'll
[1:30:45] bring you the quote
[1:30:46] he said jesus opened the bible and
[1:30:49] identified himself in the word
[1:30:54] he said that was the greatest anointing
[1:30:56] that ever struck
[1:30:57] the earth ever struck the earth
[1:31:01] was when he looked in the bible and saw
[1:31:04] who he was
[1:31:06] now what happened to me and you glory
[1:31:09] when we see who we are
[1:31:11] how many times have we quoted that when
[1:31:13] the bride realizes who she
[1:31:15] is and what she's doing here
[1:31:18] she will be an invincible army
[1:31:24] not that we can shout louder than the
[1:31:25] next person not that we can get this
[1:31:27] feeling or emotion
[1:31:30] but if supreme power in control to me
[1:31:33] is adoption where you know who you are
[1:31:37] you know what you're doing here and if
[1:31:40] something does come up and roll up
[1:31:41] against you
[1:31:42] it's like brother branham did with that
[1:31:44] man you know the man challenged him the
[1:31:46] devil's always wanting to challenge
[1:31:47] people
[1:31:48] but that's okay let him challenge but
[1:31:50] brother brown stood his ground and he
[1:31:51] told that
[1:31:52] he told that demon he said now this is
[1:31:53] not a this is not a fight of flesh
[1:31:56] in other words if i'd have been that man
[1:31:58] i'd left because right then i
[1:32:00] that man knew who he was talking to he
[1:32:02] was talking to that demon that was
[1:32:04] inside of that man
[1:32:06] he said you'll fall at my feet now he
[1:32:07] didn't reach and scream and shout no he
[1:32:09] said you'll fall at my feet
[1:32:11] jesus christ on this earth if we're back
[1:32:13] to the son of man message
[1:32:15] it's not going to be a pentecostal
[1:32:17] revival like people think i said like
[1:32:19] people
[1:32:20] think it's going to be
[1:32:23] but when we see the manifestation of god
[1:32:26] then we can shout and praise the lord
[1:32:28] knowing that it's the shout of the what
[1:32:30] king in the camp
[1:32:32] the king is here he's here to do what
[1:32:35] he's supposed to do
[1:32:36] we we will not have another messenger so
[1:32:38] if you don't believe this
[1:32:40] one and if you have questions about this
[1:32:42] one one more time
[1:32:43] if you'll get the holy ghost you won't
[1:32:45] have questions
[1:32:49] you know what look yourself in the
[1:32:50] mirror one day and say look
[1:32:53] if you don't have the holy ghost talk to
[1:32:55] yourself
[1:32:56] i want to know it look yourself in the
[1:33:00] mirror see i want to know it
[1:33:03] god you said you'd give me the holy
[1:33:05] ghost if i'd if i would ask you
[1:33:09] go through the process again get
[1:33:11] baptized do the things of god
[1:33:13] quit worrying about stupid stuff on the
[1:33:15] internet quit worried about somebody
[1:33:16] brother so-and-so i really don't care
[1:33:20] amen i'm like brother dick addison if
[1:33:23] they could prove that brother branham
[1:33:24] was an adulterer
[1:33:26] that would not bother me one bit he
[1:33:28] brought this
[1:33:29] message to me
[1:33:33] all that frivolous stuff does not mean
[1:33:35] one thing to me i've never wore a belt
[1:33:37] buckle
[1:33:41] i've never went fishing with him or
[1:33:43] wanted his knife or
[1:33:45] never wanted a part of his um floor
[1:33:50] that's relics
[1:33:53] he brought me to this yes this is what
[1:33:57] i'm gonna take me out of here not relics

[1:34:01] brother rem you know that you know i'm
[1:34:02] not
[1:34:03] greatest man that walked on two feet
[1:34:05] besides jesus christ
[1:34:06] right but he's not my savior but i know
[1:34:09] what he did he brought me to my savior
[1:34:12] he didn't just bring me to my savior he
[1:34:14] brought the son of man
[1:34:16] god in human flesh not just to be beside
[1:34:19] a group of people
[1:34:20] he brought a word for to go in a group
[1:34:24] of people

[1:36:59] things to you in jesus name
[1:37:01] amen first corinthians
[1:37:05] 11
[1:37:08] for i have received to the lord that
[1:37:10] which also i delivered unto you that the
[1:37:12] lord jesus the same night in which he
[1:37:13] was betrayed took bread
[1:37:16] when he had given thanks he breaking and
[1:37:17] said take e this is my body which is
[1:37:19] broken for you
[1:37:21] this due in remembrance of me after the
[1:37:24] same manner also he took the cup
[1:37:25] when he had stopped saying this cup is
[1:37:28] the new testament in my blood
[1:37:30] this do ye as often as you drinking in
[1:37:32] remembrance of me
[1:37:34] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:37:36] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:37:38] death
[1:37:39] till he comes wherefore whosoever shall
[1:37:42] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:37:43] lord
[1:37:44] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:37:47] unworthily just we have to be careful
[1:37:50] saying
[1:37:50] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:37:52] the lord but let a man examine himself
[1:37:54] yeah that's my brother
[1:37:55] there's an there's your way out right if
[1:37:57] you think you're unworthy at the moment
[1:37:59] there's a way out right here examine
[1:38:00] yourself
[1:38:02] and so let the meat of that bread and
[1:38:04] drink of that cup the prophet of god
[1:38:05] said if you got an art against the
[1:38:07] brother
[1:38:08] he said if you can't get to that brother
[1:38:09] he said you go ahead and take communion
[1:38:10] he said but
[1:38:11] you better go to that brother and get it
[1:38:13] straightened out our sister so
[1:38:14] so we're okay we're good right for he
[1:38:17] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:38:18] eateth and drinketh domination to
[1:38:20] himself not discerning
[1:38:22] the lord's body for this cause many are
[1:38:24] weak and sickly among you in many sleep
[1:38:26] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:38:28] should not be judged but when we are
[1:38:29] judged
[1:38:30] we are chastened of the lord that we
[1:38:32] should not be condemned with this world
[1:38:34] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:38:36] together to eat terry
[1:38:38] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:38:39] lady meat at home that you come not
[1:38:41] together into condemnation
[1:38:42] and the rest will i set in order when i
[1:38:44] come he had come to the corinthians and
[1:38:46] they were just having
[1:38:47] a drunk feast they were brain they were
[1:38:50] just having a great meal and they were
[1:38:51] just all getting drinking and staying at
[1:38:53] the table and they were just saying this
[1:38:54] is the lord's supper
[1:38:55] no it's not the lord's supper right it
[1:38:58] was a solemn time
[1:39:00] he said when you come together to eat
[1:39:01] terry one for another so we're gonna
[1:39:04] tarry just a few minutes the prophet god
