by the other minister Brethren and I appreciate him coming through and ministering for us and and all and I'm sure others will be contacting us later to come but August is generally a scheduled month for me but anyhow we we appreciate it Psalms uh 1118 and then we'll go to Zachariah for um I know you're praying for that brother Jess's boy Allan I mean praying for the family of brother Jess and all of his son Allan that passed away and then the sister in Jamaica their sister um brother Bartley's mother you know about 35 and most of you remember it's probably somewhere over 30 years ago I told you that the Lord had showed me that a lot of people would not be able to come to Rapture in faith and he didn't show me whether I'd be one of them or not so I may not be able to make it but you know the time the change the change I'm talking about now but some would have to go by the grave but that has no problems because they will actually raise before we get our chain so you know there's no disgrace it's an honor it's not a disgrace uh it's an honor to know that you could die for the word of the Lord but I said that many years ago and I still believe it that now you see a lot dying on every hand young and old but I'll tell you something else too I told a brother talking about the brother that had passed in trying to encourage him and uh we were talking about this part of you know maybe a lot of people would have to die and go by the grave and uh I told him something else I told him I had rather preach the funeral of someone that had passed on than to see him walk out the door and turn down the word am that's a hard statement that's right but I'd rather do it amen because a lot of people have turn it down that's right I watch some of you as you fall backward take my word and don't do that I'd rather preach your funeral and you see you walk away from the word okay maybe I shouldn't tell the things that God tells me sometimes but I just do it to try to let you know he is alive and well all right Psalms 118 and Zechariah 4 dear Lord Jesus we thank thank you for an opportunity tonight to be able to come together and to be able to minister your word what a great thing it is to be able to stand before the purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and to be able to proclaim the gospel that has been delivered unto us and father we pray that you would just hasten a day and come on the scene because if not a lot more of us going to be dying and going by the grave but we know that all things are within your hand and you said to it nothing's out of cater so it's all there but let us get to our place find what we need to be we love you and we thank you we commit everything into your hands Lord be with brother Bartley and him there with the the loss of the the mother and be with brother Jess brother Claud and them there Lord and the loss of the brother we pray that you would just guide each one and keep us all in your understanding in Jesus name amen Psalms 118 if you don't understand what I said a moment ago then I pray God will reveal it to you open to me the gates of righteousness I will go into them and will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter that's the Gate of the Lord the Gate of right righteousness I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused has become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord Zechariah we just go that one through seven the angel that talked with me came again and wed me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to him spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me no not knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto shubel saying not by might now what he was describing are you are you catching on I keep reading this what he was describing up here is he's now telling you what he saw all right then he answered and spake unto me saying this is is the word of the Lord unto jeral saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mar Mountain before zable Thou shalt become a Plaine and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been sometime in talking about the coming of the Lord and the prophet of God one day said a man said to him you know said you shouldn't talk to people about the the coming of the Lord cuz you scare them he said if it scares you to know that God is coming you know you shouldn't be you mean the one you served all your life you don't want to see him you know that shouldn't be it but now that's what we've been talking on is the coming of the Lord now tonight I'm just going to hold to one point I have about three sermons already written out that we could go through tonight and be here till daylight and uh you know that wouldn't be no joke if I told you but now I'm trying to get you to see that the coming of the Lord is revealed in the Bible right all right now uh we're not talking about the minute or the hour or whatever right we're talking about the coming of the Lord and what it is amen and it took 4,000 years for the Lord to come here the first time amen and that was written in the Bible right and it's took two 2,000 years now in the second coming of Jesus Christ which is the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church that's right all right now I gave you some quotes and some I'll read some I won I just give them to you to where you'd have them for what we're talking about but you say well the second coming said now nobody knows about it because even Jesus when questioned he he said he didn't know when he was coming that's true but now after his death burial and resurrection and the coming to John on patmas he had went back to where he came from he said I come from God and go to God showing he was God all the time and uh in doing that then he knew there in the Book of Revelation you know and would write about his second coming right now see I believe that because see I believe Jesus and I gave you about three quotes there where that brother randam said on uh number one now number one a is Christ is Christ is the mystery of God reveal he said it's coming is showed our revealed in every type that's in the Bible that's right right so that's enough to know that you can read it in the Bible it's in the Bible about his second coming it was in the Bible about his first coming right all right so it's easily to see that it's in the Bible about his second coming if not where are we going to look for right Jesus Christ was the Fulfillment of all the Old Testament scriptures and walking upon Earth as the word made flesh what else would you expect to be in the end time than to be that way but brother Ram said that Jesus spoke more of his second coming than he did of his first coming that's right now I gave you about three quotes there to where that you could look at it which is second coming of Christ 57 Watchman what of the night and 58 uh God's provided way 59 let's read the number four this is Mary's belief 196 1 now we're looking for a messenger in this last days because Jesus said it it would said it would be because all the prophets said it would be melachi said it would be all the prophets have testified Jesus in the very shadow of the Cross spoke more of his second coming than he did of his going away and when we see these things things begin to come to pass what in our day these things begin to come to pass that's right we better go to searching the scriptures because he said there would be false Christ arise and false prophets and will show signs and wonders and so much it would deceive the very elect if it was possible reading just today in the newspaper they said there was a chunk of Ice broke off from Greenland did you read of it that was four times the size of Manhattan now from my understanding I was reading it to look like it was saying 100 square miles and said there was no way to stop it it would move out into the channels moving there's no way cuz it was so big and said that it would be into the shipping lanes and all like that and said you would have possibly a Titanic again you know to happen like that big ship that sunk you know in what 28 or 29 or what it was he gave the day even the man himself said that the Bible is being fulfilled in the great things that are taking place see there's no way they can't stop there's nothing they can do but see we better search the scriptures not search the newspapers the newspapers are fine to read they keep us up with current events and things like that and to see what's going on but searching the scriptures the Bible said there in I believe it's in the book of Acts said that they search the Scriptures Daily to see whether these things be right or not you know all right so that's what we need to be doing we need to be searching the scriptures to make sure that we're IR right and making our calling and election sure right see and see trying to find the day that we're living amen because that's what we need to do now backgrounding a little bit because I didn't want I don't want to lose you from what I've said see we realize the only way we can search the scriptures in the correct form is by way of the message of the hour that's right because it would just be man's ideas and opinions right so we search the scriptures by the message of hour in other words we let the prophet tell us what the scriptures are revealing to us right right and now this is just what I wrote down I hope you see that I what I've tried to do and not putting my own thoughts or interpretation to the word of trying to express to you over all of these years and I right this exactly the way I think of course all preachers say that you know but will they take all all that is said by the prophet in the message and the Bible okay now getting on to the point remember we're speaking of the second coming of the Lord which is the bride coming of Christ amen the revealing of God's word amen amen 1 Peter 1:23 there says what being born again right by The Incorruptible not corruptible now Incorruptible were word of God right see and the coming out of the church has always been that the bride has to be bured out of the church right church is fine when it's used as bride but when you're using it in the scriptures as church then it's wrong see because it's got its own ideas right so then we can easily see and what's the point of what I'm getting to for a little bit we can easily see that the second coming of Jesus Christ would be like the first coming of Jesus Christ because it would require in his first coming it required a virgin birth of the word amen right right amen that's who Jesus was he was a virgin birth of the word right amen all right so now would not the second coming of Jesus Christ have to be in the same order all right and the prophet says that that on number 5A of your notes see not a with a shook remember a virgin born time if you put it in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be virgin it'll be manhandle time you get it but God's church is not touched by denomination hallelujah it's a virgin born word of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah how how wonderful I love in I believe it I know that it's the truth it not be touched there be no denominational manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride am no sir she she's commanded by God to come out of such touch not their unclean things they become vultures what now we got to come out of the church and be bured out of the church and I mean this as much as I could mean anything in my life we've got to be birt out of the church at Lula amen if you think am man told me one time he said I I left where I was at and came here because I wanted to follow the Lula thing I said brother that was the first mistake you made right that's right cuz there is no Lula thing amen he said well I wanted to come here and I could preach on Wednesdays and you could preach on Sundays oh my amen I kind of figured him out real quick he had his thing but all right but now see we've got to be Burt out of our own ideas is what I mean what's being birthed out of the church what is that a new birth being birthed out of your own ideas the new birth brings you to a condition that you don't let the human mind control you let the soul the inner part of you the being that you are you let that control you and that's what it means by by the Virgin birth of the word well it couldn't have been a virgin birth of the word there's no way to be a virgin birth of the word until first they was a a virgin word brought right so you see why the prophet's message had to come that God had to send a prophet or in Mei he said if he hadn't he would have smoked the Earth with a curse Malachi 4 other words it done been destroyed you think it's in bad shape now you know but look at it you know just just forget all about what that is and look to the word all right now I gave you the quote back which I always give you which is number five on your notes page 308 of the seal book where the second coming is the rapture now that's what your Prophet said and he says we must meet him in the skies Immortal he doesn't come here as a mortal being all right now I give you this one back because I want to keep it there number six on your notes is what what the Holy Ghost was given for 59127 says God is waiting on me and you now listen God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture all right right now it should be simple enough to be able to understand why that we're keep reading there in in uh Psalms because it says that he's become The Headstone of the corner right an adop will require and I'm not all I'm going to do is hit this back up got about 3 weeks down the road I'll be back to it but see adoption time is when God can put his trust in to the people right and you remember what I was trying to preach there a couple of services back that in The Headstone will be the most visibility form of God that will be here before the Rapture comes right I believe that I believe the headstone will be the VIS visibility you say signs and wonders I thought that was what I was saying all right you know I mean I I thought that's what I was trying to bring out because you won't have adoption time without manifested Sons and Daughters right I thought that was what I was trying to say sometimes I don't explain that and you know people think well don't wor s about okay I guess I don't but I know a God that does see but what I'm trying to do is get you and I to look into the Bible and see the Bible is talking about us amen and revealing our place right in the Bible right mhm seeing ourselves in the Bible right recognizing your day in its message right to see where we're at and what's going on right now all right see we covered how that Zachariah saw the coming of the seven Church ages right and the revealing of Jesus Christ in those ages you remember the message that Zachariah because it says not by power not by might but by the holy spirit amen and you remember what I told you the way you reading it in Zechariah Zachariah don't know he doesn't know what these candlesticks are he doesn't know what these olive trees are he doesn't know anything about it and God says listen Zechariah this is the word of the Lord under rable amen so what is the church ages and the Seven golden candlesticks right amen what did we go through with Revelations 1 in verse 12 through about 16 there how that you see in Revelations 1 you see one in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like unto the son of man it says gir about the PS with a golden girdle the girl is moved is not in the servitude part of it's in the point of showing the what paths femin that's the bride showed in the seven Church agent I gave you that read it then number n number seven on your notes and why that we're not a denomination the prophet was saying what if you notice we find Jesus standing in the seven Church ages and the Seven golden candlesticks when he turned and saw one like unto the son of man stand en clothed how was it it was a bride standing in the candlesticks drawn out y amen that's what he was shown now watch in a minute because we're going to get into this Candlestick lampstand and we're going to make one statement and everything has to tie together with it or else we don't have the right revelation now the natural back there they made a Candlestick it was in the inner Court not in the holy of holies it was in the inner court all right it was there where that they would keep it lit because the curtains was pulled around there was no light in there that's right but it was not in behind the holy of holies now right but it was put there by Moses and when it was doing it then what was Moses speaking of well he just made a leftand he just went on made a left I got to look in these things up and if you'll read in the scripture there you'll find that Moses we'll get to it in a little while he said that that uh Candlestick was made from one Talent of gold now Wikia the best they can do on it says it that's about 75 lb right now 75 lb of gold it says that Solon or David one of the two David I think had 666 talents of gold brought in yearly to making all of the things try to run some things on it and you get on over into the New Testament with the scriptures and you find out that in the New Testament a talet would probably weigh about 200 lb you remember over there in the Book of Revelations where it talks about how The Hil Stones would fall out of the sky and it says they we tet that's about 200 lb so irregardless of what I'm talking about the point is if it weighs 75 lb or 200 lb it was a big old thing it wasn't no little old bitty thing that we look at like it's up here at the front down there you know and I gave you a picture of it and we'll get to that in a minute but the point I want you to see is that Candlestick was made and when it was made it would be brought over to Zachariah Zachariah would catch more than Moses would about it but I'll repeat this again in a minute about 10 times when Moses built that Candlestick Zachariah could not make it of any other way right and neither could The Book of Revelation right it could show what it meant but it couldn't be made any difference that's right because it's Hebrews 13:8 right all right so now in Revelations one he's one standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick so what was Zechariah being shown the this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel what the building of the candlesticks the bride is the word of the Lord you remember what I was trying to bring out on that each age was the word made manifest for the age they were living in that's right and see in doing that then each one has got to be seeing the same thing if not what are you going to do but now listen to the next one number eight on your notes this is taken from 49 of the church age book which is patas Vision as I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks John does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the voice oh I like that and he turned to see the voice the voice and the person are one and the same that's right Jesus is the word right now what was Zachariah shown the word right of the Lord unders rable but what was he shown up in Revelation one standing in the midst of seven golden Candlestick a bride draw out listen the voice and the person are one and the same Jesus is the word John 1 in the beginning was the word and word with God and word was with God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made if you ever get to really see the word word you'll be seeing Jesus right listen I love that when John turned continuation of the reading he saw seven golden candlesticks actually they were lampstands and according to verse 20 they are the seven Church ages the seven Candlestick that all are the seven Church ages to represent the church that could be that could hardly be candle a candle burns but a while and then it is burned out it dies there would be no more to it but lampstands possess a lasting quality not found in candles all right now so your Prophet is giving you the definition that when Moses built a lamp stand he built I mean a Candlestick he was actually building a lamp standand right right m but they called it a Candlestick cuz it's not candles stuck up on a stick you know whatever no no it's got to be correct and see when John saw it on patmas he saw a wonderful thing that he could see the bride standing in the candlesticks or the loun stand now we want to get that loun stand cuz that's the message that we're getting to tonight is the lampstand he was standing in that now watch look on down to patas Vision 1960 1204 the evening service number 9A read them A's is in there I pick these up later and I put them back in I cut and paste and give them to you okay cuz I don't care I don't know much about these lap stands and things like that except what the prophet has to say about it cuz that's where I get it from now what is a Candlestick it is a lamp stain and notice how beautiful here when he turned he saw this one like the son of man here standing in the midst of the seven golden Lou stands which means seven Church ages to come remember where John was at looking right and each pipe or lampstand hooked into the main big oil sensor and this oil come forth up to a little old shaped odd shaped lamp that set with a wick in it and the wick hung down in the oil and that as long they poured oil into the top of the stand which filling filled up the main big stem and the Big Branch as it run out into the stems like this and the lamp with a wick hanging down this this piping into kept the burner day and kept burning day and night you never have to light it you could it kept burning you talking about the wick from the lamp down into there got his life out of here oh what different it is from a candle how different is a lampstand is pulling oil am now he was seeing the bride of Christ amen and the holy ghost in the bride right not by power not by might Zachariah but by my spirit sayth the Lord all right the Bible speaks in the Book of Revelations of seven spirits of God there's not seven spirits of God because it's not seven gods your Prophet explains it it is one spirit manifested in seven Church ages one for you know the Holy Ghost for each age is explaining the seven of that now but what I want you to think about for a minute the scripture has to give us the true interpretation and we must start then with Zachariah if Zachariah and John will see the same thing you got to be getting close right right I mean that's senseful so now this is going to require a little thinking with you I'd like for you to draw me the picture that Moses done back there in the scripture in Exodus let's go back there I'd like for you to draw me that picture and come out any other way then what that lampstand is so let's read this that Moses was to build and then you draw it and I'd be glad for you to bring it up here if you draw it and show it to me whatever but look what Moses Exodus 25 and you also find in Exodus 37 you know will be another time that it shown 25:31 let's read verse 40 where you start and look that thou make them after their pattern which was showed thee in the mount and Moses build this lampstand after the pattern you see in the mount verse 40 you'll find it in numbers 8 and 4 you'll find Paul speaking of it in Hebrews 8 and5 that it was made after the pattern that Moses saw in the mount now let's see let's read what he saw and let's see what he built and thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold verse 31 of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knops I guess the way you pronounce that K PS and his flowers shall be of the same all of it's going to be pure gold right okay so now you draw this and six branches shall come out of the sides of it three branches out of the Candlestick out of the one side and three branches of the Candlestick out of the other side three bowls made like of the almonds with a knock and a flower in a one branch and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch with a knp and a flower so in the six branches that come out of the Candlestick and in the Candlestick shall be four bowls made like un almonds with their knots and their flowers and there shall be a knp under two branches of the same and a knp under two branches of the same and a knp under two branches of the same according to the six branches that precede out of the Candlestick their knots and their branches shall be of the same all of it shall be one beaten work of pure gold solid all of it one work solid right th shall make the seven lamps thereof and they shall light the lamps thereof that they may give light over against it then he talks about the tongues therefore and snuff dishes and the things and of a talent of pure shall he make it with all these vessels now something waying at least we'll have to consider from 75 lb to 200 lb and they've got pictures if you want to run them into your in your uh you know computer on your internet they got pictures of where they were taken down in and and they're even depicted over at Rong Italy now and showing the things but a tallet of pure gold now you know also I'm sure that gold is not measured in pounds I'm just going to give you this it's measured it by Troy gold you go down to a store and say I want one pound of gold you know what they're going to give you they're going to give you 12 O you just lost money didn't you yeah it's a Troy oun is what you measure and things when you're measuring gold so don't go in and try to figure out how that you got beat all of this you you asked for a pound and you get 12 oz because it's a Troy it's like you go down to the baker and you want a dozen donuts how many do you get 13 you get 13 all right cuz that's a Baker's Dozen that's right I've done a little study on this to show you cuz measurements from every different country was entirely different and it's still in to some degrees and actually gold and different things was measured by the Romans by a little old cylinder about that long that you could pour certain amount of water in it and that was the weight of the gold and water is like what six almost six lbs per gallon so youd have to calculate I'm just showing you that so as somebody comes along and said well he didn't really know what he talking about so I just picked up a lot of the other things to to give you a little light on it but now draw me out that picture that Moses saw now if he hadn't seen it he'd have been in trouble right you read it and draw it you read Zachariah and draw it you got branches you got all kind of things to be consumed there and over in Zachariah you find out that there's two olive trees so you got a funny looking outfit you got bowls you got plots which is bugs you got all kind of things but thank God what Moses made is exactly what he saw in heaven and when he got through making it it's identical to the scripture see what I'm saying is when God showed a man something he showed him what he wanted he told him what he wanted but he showed it to him he come down off the mountain and this is what he made the seven golden candlesticks and it's identical to the scripture what I'm trying to get you to see the Perfection of God's word amen now Zachariah what he saw can't be draw out to look like this what John draw on the a of patmas wouldn't look like that right if it's not revealed that's what I'm talking about a prophet of God God speaks to the to Moses and tells him exactly you go sometime and try to figure out how to build that tent right and you will go Haywire trying to figure out all the things but see Moses saw it amen now Moses didn't see what John saw on patmas with the son of man standing in the midst of the golden can ex no he saw exactly what God wanted him to say and he made it amen but when he got to making it you got to have that every time as a foundation to keep it lined up that might get interesting a little bit so you might think it's just boring but I would ask you to draw it out you know to just sometimes draw out what you think but just save you a lot of trouble just go get what Moses and this will identically fit the scriptures now here's what people get me because they did about the 70 weeks of day Daniel about all the things we don't need to know about all of these things all we need to know is revelation that's what I'm talking about when I talking about Daniel 70 weeks the revelation of Jesus Christ not dates and times and Seasons I told you that those were all of the natural things so is this but now watch we read enough from the prophet to show that it was Jesus Christ standing in the midst of the seven golden C standing in the bride that John turned to hear the voice the voice and the person is the same and when he did he saw the bride amen you remember what I've tried to get you to see that the Book of Revelations find me Jesus by himself in the Book of Revelations somebody bring it to me you said well what about that lamb I'm glad you thought of that that lamb in Revelation that seven horns and seven eyes which is the seven spirits of God that went forth in the earth and your prophet of God said that lamb came from the church ages amen if you know what you're talking about you're not afraid right because you just stand and say well that's it you know let's see it let's see you draw I'm not being sarcastic I'm trying not this to save your soul just the natural to show you is the natural let me ask you a simple question we know for certainty that they used olive oil because it was two olive trees right right will olive oil burn what degree of temperature would you have to get olive oil to to make it burn can you strike a match to a bottle of olive oil or something you don't do it to gas do you and you don't do it with oil down there because that's what they've been showing you that they can burn the stuff that's L up on top of the water right that's what I love about your prophet he was not only a man that knew the word of God but he was a simple man that understood simple things I gave you a quote we'll get to it in a few minutes the Lord willing he said if you're running low on oil in your lamp do you know what you do what would you think you do if you're running low on oil in your lamp what would you think you'd pour into it you pour water pour water in to the lamp and oil comes to the top you just got to make sure you raise your Wick up right amen all right so we established one thing for certain that this lamp stand is not something to where that you got a Coleman's lantern that you pour gas in and you pump it up and it sprays up and out comes the fire no it's got to have a way of working okay all right so now let's look you got the the little drawing you know brother Joe put this on the computers I don't know how he'll show up on that because we'll do something with it on the video but let's read this cuz remember my point we'll get back to it when Zachariah was shown the lampstand candlesticks that was way over in the Bible Moses had already built the lamp stand the candlesticks in Exodus 25 so Zachariah knew what the lampstand meant he just couldn't understand the other things that went with it right because what he couldn't understand was all of this about the the pups and the bubs and the do and the this and that and he couldn't understand the two olive trees do you understand the two olive trees oh yeah Moses Elijah brother brandham said it was the church ages old and new we'll get to something in a minute if we get that far Aaron asked me a question about something the other day because in Zachariah you find that there's one lampstand Candlestick you find in the Revelation Book of Revelations in the third 11th chapter that there's two candlesticks what's going on but let's take this little drawing just a minute and let's just look at it and let's read and see if Moses done what he said cuz verse 31 it says Thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold a beaten work shall the Candlestick be mate his shaft now shaft is a bowl you're going to look at it like a sh sha shaft right it's a b or a base and put it that way and his branches branch is a reed or a stalk you know to keep you where you won't dry up on me I thought Jesus said that he was the vine and we were the what right okay I thought we just make sure you don't dry up see and his bowls are his bowls bowls are cups now I'm giving you the definition out of strong concordance and the k and o PS knots those knots are bubs be lb and you got the flowers and the flowers is talked about is knots and bugs you know better all right now and six branches shall come out of the base of it here's your base coming up six branches he said wait a minute there's seven well let's don't get that far we got a more scripture to cover first six branches look three branches of the Candlestick out of the one side and three branches of the Candlestick out of the other side so that's easy to look at then you got three bowls made like under almonds can you find some almonds on there with a knp and a flower in one branch and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch in other words each one of these branches you got to have three bowls so in the six branches that come out of the Candlestick all right so what are you looking for but in the candles stick which is referring to the center section there's four bowls and under each one of the branches verse 35 and there shall be a knot under two branches what is a knot bub BB bub right not a light bub now and a KN under two branches the same and a knp under two branches the same according to the six branches that preset free day out of the Candlestick no simply look at it look right down under each one of the on the candlesticks and you'll find three bowls right one two three three bowls on each one of them all right okay three bowls for each L but remember the key one there says there was four in the center one just come down the shaft get down to the bottom of the shaft right above where it starts and right there's another Bowl right so he's got his bowls right let put the bowls in it all right so you put a knp under each one of the sets of branches the knp is a bub bub bub bub 1 2 3 now you got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 bubs up at the top one under right over the top of each cup you got a bub a KN which is a bu all right you're looking for a flower just looked right above the knot and there's pretty beautiful flowers draw out around on each side of each one of the candlesticks all right then in the top the top of it is what we have to get over into the other scripture in a minute to find it but it's uh you get over to it and when you do you'll find uh that that's lamps on top right okay Moses you've got that part right what about the other where is the two Olive branches where is the olive oil right down here in the bottom it's poured in it says it's poured in the shaft remember now this is all solid I Reon I wanted you to refer to that it's made of one solid piece right they don't pour this one out and pour oil down to that shaft no the oil comes up through the shaft from where down in the bottom but it don't get up there by itself so when we get over into Zachariah we've got to keep this picture we got to say this is what Zachariah saw it won't fit together if you don't so we go over to Zachariah Zachariah says the angel talk with me came again wake me as a man out of his sleep he said unto me what sayest thou and I said I have looked and behold a lamp a Candlestick all of gold and a bowl of on the top of it now draw that a bowl up on the top of it what do you mean draw it's a Candlestick in there with a bowl on it now the bows is the bowls are just showed you three of them under each one it's not up on top hanging up in the sky with a bowl up on the top of it and his seven lamps there on see there's your seven top thing seven lamps the light is up at the top right in the lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl the other on the left side thereof see that's where you run over and you say well you got to have now you got to draw out these it won't fit Moses go ahead and say it the reason you got olive trees listed is because that's where you get the olive oil off the olive trees right right you see the oil is poured down in here okay right now olive oil won't burn so what do you got to have a way to get the olive oil up through the shaft right okay look at 9 a on your quotes pmas Vision 1960 1204 156 one I just read what is a Candlestick it's a lampstand notice how beautiful here when he turned he saw this one like the son of man here standing in the midst of the seven golden lamp stands which means seven Church ages to come and each pip or lampstand hooked into the main big oil sensor and in this oil come forth up to a little odd shaped lamp that's up on the top thing that set with a wick in it now Moses didn't describe a wick Moses described the L and oil but you got to have that wi okay odd-shaped lamp that set with a wick in it and the wick hung down in the oil as long as they poured oil in the top of the stand which filled up the main big stem and the big branches as it run out into the stems like this and the lamp with the wick hanging down this this pip into that kept burning day night the wick now if you can't find the hold on a minute you got to have a wig how many of you ever run a lamp right amen okay we're all old enough basically at least the seen one even the kids the oil is not necessarily now listen burning it's the wick that the oil is coming up in right kerosene in other words true and you set up the wick on fire and as long as there's oil in the bottom it'll automatically Wick itself up right you just light it and it'll Wick it that's why you got to cut it off trim it you got to do all kind of things to it and that's what they had to do too so the lamp stand by itself that Moses was shown to draw won't bring you the picture of the Book of Revelations and the Seven golden Candlestick neither will it bring you to Zachariah which would be the word of the Lord you got to have the wick Escape come hither quickly number nine down on your notes paragraph 39 how love that parable of the Virgin and you know the old Co oil Wick Co L we used to have he never had lights till this just recently look here the oil's in the bottom of the lamp and there's a wick that draws it up now that Wick has to be a special made piece of material and the fire comes on the end of the wick and now notice you couldn't put a pipe down in there and it would draw it up he's telling you you couldn't put a pipe there it just run up turn the thing upside down you might have a chance but oil won't burn that way that kind olive oil cursing would but you couldn't put a pipe down in there and it would draw it up it won't come through iron made man-made things it only comes through God's provided way and the wick is faith and the only thing that can pull the Holy Spirit into uh light is the Holy Ghost itself and when you get when you got your faith one end of it on fire for the glory of God and the other dipped into God's holy ghost oil there's going to be a Shining Light just as certain as I'm standing in thein got to have a wick okay number 10 patmas Vision 162 I would invite you to read patmas Vision or listen to it 60 12:04 these lamp stems all fit into one great big bow one great big holder and nine different or seven different lampstands come out of it lamp holders ex come out of it and when they did each one of those lights was drawing from the main resource of its life and its life was because it had because it its candle dipped down into this main bar had its candle dipped down into this main barel Oh what a beautiful picture of one of those Seven Stars that's represented there with his life on fire with the Holy Ghost and by by faith he's burning with a Holy Ghost and his life is a candle or not a candle but a wick that's dipped into the Holy Spirit into Christ and through that Wick he's drawing the life of God out to give light to his church oh oh what a picture of the True Believer amen now you're seeing John did see Jesus Christ standing in the church Moses tried to build what he saw but he just buil a lampstand right amen zachari is picking up the point because he's told it's the word of God seal of God 1961 to16 he talking about it's lamp trimming time yes it needs trimming Pentecost better be trimming some lamps amen get a lot of this wh cut away from you you done got corroded over the Wicks got in bad shape now anybody that ever run a lamp like that you got to take it and cut that off right you just literally cut it off raise it up cut it off light it again right right CU if you don't it Just Smokes like a taril and won't give no light whatsoever throt it over the Wicks got in bad shape you know that Wick is a great thing I used to want what a real Wick of God is a a Believer is a wick look he's got a fire on one end up here the other end's dipping into oil drawing oil and making fire what a church what a power what a place tells us to rise and trim of lamps 52 patus Vision how thrilling it is to think of seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of that M bold because they had their wits dipped therein each Church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost his Wick life has been immersed in Christ through that Wick he is drawing the very Life of Christ and by it gives out light to the church what kind of light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested Be A Life That's hid with God in Christ so Moses build what you saw he built seven golden candlesticks or a lamp stamp he built it in made it and we found that it matches with the bows the bug the lamps all of it matches and you say well how do you know that's what that is well if you'll go home and run it into your encyclopedia and just run in manora whatever how you pronounce it but make sure you do not like I did it is m n o r a h but it pronounced monora which is ma but run in me you r teach right don't be a dummy like me it took me a while to figure that one out cuz I couldn't find it in the dictionary why cuz I look in the wrong place but look what Moses saw Zachariah can't be any different the only thing Zachariah is telling you that it's the word of the Lord down through seven Church right am the Book of Revelations is showing you that word down through seven Church ages we read there where the Prophet said the word to come because when that was showed to John the seven Church ages had not come into being yet it's the word of God in The Bride of Jesus Christ the one little key is is the wick of your life right this of mine I'm going right right got have Wick to run down through there Moses didn't tell them that I guess he figured that they had enough sense to be able to know it the actual Wicks back in those days were made out of wool CU wool is the best Wick you can make piece of wool cloth we used to take those old lamps and those things and have to turn them up and cuz even after we had electric lights and we were living in a house that finally one day about 46 had electric lights and to get up your SK your lessons you had to light the lamp because it was 25 wat bug sticking up in a 12T ceiling now you figure how much light you got out of that so you'll know we had to still these used lamps up until the way on up into the 50s because you couldn't do it and we finally learned how to run the L the light down and extend the wire till we got it down the head high and it still didn't do much good yeah but listen folks Zachariah them saw God in seven Church CH amen it's all the lamps that would bring up the oil cuz that lamp is no good without a wit that runs all the way down you let that Wick get burned out you got to do something for it that's right you got to keep putting that fixing that Wick so I assume probably in those days which is that's what we done how many of you ever done this we'd take the wick and roll up in the bottom of the bowl and pour oil on it and then it would stay in there and then you just kept turning a little knob that brought it up and as you did it would burn for sometimes a year before you had to replace that Wick that was in there amen and I even studied this there were only like three of those lamps that were in the the holy I mean in the um what is it called not called the holy of holies um the the outer court but it's got another word for it Court inner court all right and in that inner Court every one of them didn't burn you'll find if you'll study it that over there that U uh one of them David or one of them had 10 candlesticks you know it's there but all that speaks of being you right yeah your life dipped in the Holy Ghost and let your light shine that's it right there because without that Wick up at the top of that all that's down under there is worth nothing right right am it's Christ in the seven Church ages that he's trying to show so Zachariah saw what Moses made and God said but Zachariah it is not just a Candlestick a l stand right it is showing that in the future age is to come it's going to be not by my my not by power but by my spirit it's going to be the holy spirit in seven Church ages am it's going to be the life of God and John saw it as the son of man standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick you and I are that lamp folks that little Wick that's right without that Wick I am the vine you are the branches Hallelujah the Vine doesn't Bear right branches it's the branches that bear the vine runs the life up to where the branches are at go out and if Jacob was here he can give you a good lesson on how to prune a a grap Vine right you got to prune that thing back to where when he puts out a new V there's where your grapes come from right but you see folks we're that Weck your prophit are we read it where he said a Believer you're the one that's supposed to be letting the light shine you're the ones let be letting the gospel shine okay but brother daylight it says over there in zachi there was was two olive trees and we'll get back to that but you see it's Christ reveal down through seven Church ages the light of the gospel and without you God don't have no light to shine right you he can do what he wants to he can't break his word that's right and he's done said you are the I'm the vine you're the branches right he said it's not by power not by might but by my spirit right you're going to see me in those gandle those candle lamp stand you remember why the prophet said lamp stand cuz candles just burn out and they're gone amen so it's not something sticking up in the candle Pro in the end of it you go in there every once while change a candle no if you kept that thing running correctly and they did they kept three of them I read there they kept three of them running in that even in the daytime but most of them they put them out in the daytime I wonder sometimes as our lamp one out you said well brother Dale you told us one let's read it then we'll quit you said that Prophet was very smart he was the message of the live story 1951 4:15 he said I remember when we used to have a 2 gallon can of coal oil we burn coal oil lights you've done that haven't you many of you burn the coil oil light did you ever get to a place where you didn't have enough oil for the wick to reach in there pour water in it and let it get up there kerosene will float on the top right or cold oil will float on the top of the water you said well what's that got to do with it I thought we were Washed by the Water of the work that's right amen I thought that was what we were washed by I thought the scripture says you're washed by the water of the world oh I I want it all now what about your life cuz that's what I just got through trying to explain the Holy Ghost is the oil that was in the lamb but the wick is you right and he has to add the washing of the water of the word right and keep us clean what do you think about it Moses I think you really saw something well there's two olive trees I'll give it to you your Prophet said it's the old and the New Testament then he said it was Moses Elijah well I'll give you a little bit where it won't be too long and see in Zechariah you see one lampstand in Revelations you see two right brother Brandon said there's seven Church ages in the Old Testament that's right and there's seven in the new so when John sees a Elijah and Moses after the Rapture in Revelations 11 he sees the bride of Christ as one Candlestick lampstand and he sees Israel as the other lampstand your Bible's right don't have to be changed it has to just wait till the day in Time come on right but is your Wick dipped into the Holy Ghost see a lot of our problems a lot of times is we keep adding too much water until we run the oil out of the lamp and that may be what is speaking of in there in the parable of the foolish virgins where it says our lamps are gone out the Bible says our lamps are going out you know they had a little something the foolish virgins had a little oil they had a lamp and the wick they had everything they just didn't have enough oil if fact just kept pouring water in there trying to get to raise up it finally run out until it starts sputtering work foolish virgin she's got a certain amount of word all and the Holy Ghost can use her but it'll eventually burn out but the bride she brought oil with her in her lamp the Holy Ghost in our lives but let that Wick let it live out to other people let them see your life if you want to win somebody to this message it's not quoting them to death right not trying to tell them how bad they are and how sorry they are and what they need to do he showing him Jesus Christ a wick of Life a Believer who's anchored in that Holy Ghost right take on these things let's stand 58 the red number 58 the red boook let's stand anybody has a need there's a call com bringing nor the
