[4:54] the information that we have here i i
[4:56] presume they're sending this out where
[4:58] you'll know i'll kind of
[4:59] kind of go over it you know the reason
[5:02] he was
[5:03] uh the reason that he got in trouble
[5:07] was that he went to the school with his
[5:10] sons
[5:11] and the teachers there were teaching uh
[5:14] islam and he protested that
[5:18] that's what got him in trouble i always
[5:19] thought he was preaching when they came
[5:21] in
[5:22] and they just kind of escalated this up
[5:25] the charges went from that to
[5:26] evangelism to muslims and a part uh
[5:30] and then this crime is punishable
[5:33] by hanging but it's just kind of
[5:35] escalating from that but that's where it
[5:37] started he went to school

[27:01] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[27:04] amen
[27:06] you can be seated we'd like to talk on
[27:08] this just a little bit and
[27:10] i was kind of going through this the
[27:12] other night i woke up about two o'clock
[27:14] in the morning
[27:16] i was telling my brother never had
[27:18] really
[27:19] thought much about this little uh
[27:22] scripture here
[27:24] but you know it's just the spirit of god
[27:26] just kind of run it through me and it
[27:28] got
[27:28] better and better and i thought man
[27:32] there's a lot to do with it's a
[27:33] lifestyle you know
[27:35] because it does something for you and i
[27:39] just got to say
[27:40] lord just let me just rub it all over me
[27:43] anyway you know it's good for a gator
[27:47] if you can just get the meaning of it
[27:49] and i'm sure the prophet of god
[27:52] uh got a little taste of this you know
[27:55] and
[27:55] he really really put it in his eyes and
[27:59] you know i believe that god really let
[28:01] him be anointed with he did
[28:02] praise the lord and i believe tonight if
[28:05] god's little bride can get
[28:08] just make sure that we've got this rubs
[28:10] in our eyes real good you know
[28:13] and inner years and all over us you know
[28:15] it's good for you it just goes plumb
[28:16] down in your heart
[28:17] this is something you know they got
[28:19] different uh
[28:22] uh medicine and stuff you know it's
[28:24] they'll give it
[28:25] to you and it'll just go all through
[28:26] your body you know stop
[28:28] all the pains and you know it kind of
[28:31] does a great thing you take a aspen of
[28:34] something that's you know
[28:35] you're hurting any you take a aspen
[28:37] maybe a head or something about your
[28:39] body and
[28:40] you take that little aspen it just goes
[28:42] to work don't it
[28:44] it goes down circulates through your
[28:47] bloodstream and gets down in earth to
[28:48] where your
[28:49] pain's at where your suffering's in and
[28:52] i was thinking about this uh
[28:54] the other night as i was thinking about
[28:55] this i saved i said lord
[28:58] i know i got something quite a few years
[29:01] ago and
[29:02] you know it's still working today praise
[29:03] the lord amen
[29:05] and it just gets better and better you
[29:07] know it's just
[29:08] it goes all the way through you know it
[29:10] just it gets the
[29:12] moving on every part and you know it's
[29:15] it's good for you praise the lord
[29:18] i know we used to have a lot on side
[29:20] back when i was young you know mama and
[29:22] make some and
[29:23] it gets some i guess from different
[29:25] places and
[29:27] and you know it was good for different
[29:28] things you know different things about
[29:30] your body and
[29:31] sores and different things but here i
[29:34] believe god is
[29:35] referring to something else you know
[29:37] just like kind of like the little woman
[29:39] that was at the well that time when uh
[29:41] you know when jesus happened to be there
[29:44] at the time that she
[29:46] walked up you know and she needed
[29:48] something she praised the lord amen
[29:50] and kind like that water was you know
[29:52] god had to
[29:55] uh kind of get her attention he started
[29:57] off kind of the natural things but
[29:59] he had a spiritual meaning for her you
[30:01] know
[30:02] you know she had to find out what the
[30:05] water is talking about this
[30:06] she had to get a little taste of it you
[30:09] know she had a desire
[30:10] and had to get to a place that she that
[30:13] she uh
[30:14] when god kind of searched the heart out
[30:16] a little bit you know and found out a
[30:17] little bit about her
[30:18] i believe he's still doing that tonight
[30:21] amen
[30:22] i believe that the holy spirit is still
[30:25] the same
[30:26] yesterday then forever and i believe god
[30:29] is still the same
[30:30] you know i a lot of times i preach it or
[30:33] a little church down in lincoln i don't
[30:34] have to
[30:35] worry because well if i had a
[30:37] congregation like this i'd
[30:38] kind of be obscured to say some of the
[30:40] things i said
[30:41] but sometimes i get kind of rough you
[30:43] know i think well
[30:45] boy we just ain't got too many to pick
[30:47] on and
[30:48] i just get a big old thing in my soul
[30:50] sometime and i just
[30:52] try to put it all on them i guess felt
[30:54] like it man was one time he
[30:56] had plenty of said i got plenty of hay
[30:58] on the fort but you can't feed it all to
[31:00] one person okay
[31:02] you know you got to kind of take it easy
[31:04] on them so i
[31:05] just like uh me i i kind of have to
[31:09] look around and i ain't got a little
[31:11] handful so i can't hurt them too bad
[31:13] and they got news to me but here you
[31:15] know when you go out somewhere i
[31:17] incredible minister i've been asked that
[31:20] a lot of people ask me to come
[31:21] different places but i just you know i
[31:23] feel so little i just say oh my
[31:25] i might want to feel like that but i
[31:28] just don't feel like i'm qualified to
[31:30] speak to some of the people i just
[31:31] listened to some of these brothers talk
[31:33] here before service say amen one of them
[31:35] especially and just listen to him i said
[31:39] man i need to hear him pray
[31:41] praise the lord he knows about these
[31:44] things you know
[31:45] and you know you just find yourself
[31:47] sometime but you about you're learning
[31:49] you know
[31:50] thank god for that eyesight amen
[31:52] hallelujah
[31:53] it's a goodness to a place you know that
[31:55] we can
[31:56] or get our understanding open right i
[31:59] mean to say
[32:00] that he's talking about but it gets when
[32:02] you put it on your eyes
[32:04] it kind of opens up your eyes if you
[32:06] understand right
[32:07] and it goes all the way through down to
[32:09] your heart and everywhere you know
[32:11] it'll it'll make everything just line up
[32:13] praise god amen
[32:15] hallelujah don't take much of it you
[32:17] know you don't have to
[32:19] put it on the other day it should get a
[32:20] little of it i told a brother here i
[32:22] said
[32:23] backyard back in 70s i believe it was or
[32:25] maybe
[32:26] right there somewhere but god give me
[32:29] some of it i got some of it
[32:32] and i'll tell you when i did it started
[32:34] opening up my understanding
[32:37] i could see better you know like we sang
[32:39] your old song amazing grace how sweet
[32:41] the sound
[32:42] that saved the wretch like me before i
[32:45] found out that that scythe will open up
[32:47] all this amazing grace to you thank god
[32:50] it'll begin to
[32:51] open up thanks to you from one place to
[32:54] look
[32:55] it begins to show you things amen that's
[32:57] god has got in your head sometimes
[33:00] you know i found out that when i thought
[33:02] i used to know everything about god
[33:05] and all about him but after i got to
[33:06] looking in the scriptures
[33:08] and things and listened to him and
[33:10] especially when i heard the prophet of
[33:12] god
[33:13] i found out that i i just really had the
[33:16] anointing but i didn't
[33:17] have any understanding you know we used
[33:20] to have a
[33:22] backyard we come up these mountains up
[33:24] here we owned up in
[33:26] little hills up here and we only thing
[33:28] we don't we thought were boy when you
[33:30] got saved all you need to do is just
[33:32] really
[33:33] just get to northern you know just get
[33:35] really make sure you got to north and
[33:37] you know i knew it was good
[33:39] right i mean we still need that tonight
[33:41] though
[33:44] i tell you i believe sometimes we a lot
[33:47] of people thanks you know we
[33:49] just kind of don't need the anointing
[33:50] but we do we need that holy spirit we
[33:52] need god's
[33:54] holy ghost inside of us don't we it
[33:56] needs to be our leader it needs to be
[33:58] our teacher
[33:59] and uh for a while but when i got
[34:02] acquainted with the message i want to
[34:03] tell this tonight just give a little bit
[34:05] of my testimony
[34:07] and uh and then we'll forget i used to
[34:09] be up here

[34:28] used to be with him a lot in a little
[34:30] building here
[34:31] and boy it was a blessing i couldn't
[34:33] hear we'd be coming up the road been
[34:35] some of the brothers and what was
[34:37] amazing about it we'd be on the same
[34:39] message that our brother would preach
[34:41] right we'd we'd be fellowshipping on the
[34:44] same thing
[34:45] coming up the road brother colleen knows
[34:48] about it we'd uh
[34:50] when we come here brother moses everyone
[34:52] who was here
[34:53] we pray and i'll tell you what that'd be
[34:56] open up to the bible right to where
[34:58] where is it talking about right before
[35:00] it was
[35:02] because we had to grow in god we had to
[35:05] know something about the lord jesus
[35:07] christ you know and
[35:08] and when it opened up that scripture
[35:10] that morning teaching or at night
[35:12] whenever we was here
[35:13] i s which listen you know cause god was
[35:16] speaking to us right
[35:17] sometimes we don't take it for granted
[35:19] like we should
[35:20] that god sometimes through the teaching
[35:22] of god's word and
[35:24] and as god's uh minister begins to
[35:28] you know bring it to us and begin to
[35:29] feed it because
[35:31] we ain't careful it's so easy and so
[35:33] simp and simplistic you know we've
[35:35] missed some of it that's right
[35:37] but oh i remember back then when we'd
[35:39] have our own heart
[35:41] and uh oh brother won't see it get up
[35:42] here and uh
[35:44] and kind of it seemed like god just tell
[35:47] him what to say you know
[35:50] because that's what her heart was crying
[35:52] for was hungry for something
[35:54] like the little lady come to the whale
[35:56] she really didn't
[35:58] understand what she was there for but
[36:00] before she left there she knows what she
[36:02] come for
[36:04] she found what she come for brother god
[36:08] sees us before we ever really get to him
[36:11] you know before we
[36:12] get our understanding open he's got a
[36:14] way of getting us to something ain't he
[36:16] praise the lord amen
[36:18] but we're not aware of what you see just
[36:19] like the scriptures that's why i believe
[36:21] he said search the scriptures
[36:23] for in them we think we have eternal
[36:25] life
[36:26] and he said these are they didn't
[36:28] testify with me not
[36:29] right you know what probably easy it was
[36:31] easy for me back then because i
[36:33] had tried to keep the anointing on my
[36:35] life i'd do everything i could brother
[36:38] to
[36:39] go without food you can't tell that now
[36:41] but back
[36:43] back then you know you could you know i
[36:45] i'd go and pray and
[36:48] i got it on a little film showing it to
[36:50] some friends of theirs the other night
[36:51] back up here in the mountains
[36:53] where i used to spend a lot of days and
[36:56] prayer and
[36:57] you know and stay back in them woods and
[36:59] talk to god
[37:00] and god would come down and just make
[37:02] itself real tell me in the spirit you
[37:04] know
[37:05] but i didn't have no education much i
[37:07] didn't have known very much but i
[37:09] learned about him you know
[37:11] right hey man i'd rather really that's
[37:14] the greatest education you really get
[37:16] right because if he can ever get you in
[37:18] him he can let take care of the rest of
[37:20] his
[37:22] i didn't know hardly how to read
[37:24] couldn't explain my words too good still
[37:26] can't but yes
[37:28] god was helping me you know he's kind of
[37:30] getting a place to where he could teach
[37:31] me amen
[37:32] amen and i i know uh brother gable i
[37:36] believe was give me some
[37:38] little notes here and thanks that
[37:40] brother dale had been teaching on up
[37:42] here at the church here fall back and
[37:43] boy i've been
[37:44] i was getting in there and catching some
[37:46] little nuggets you know and
[37:48] just to eating on them boy it's good for
[37:50] you praise the lord
[37:51] i'm telling you when god's got somebody
[37:54] that can get in here and bring out
[37:55] little nuggets for you
[37:57] and place them in here where you can see
[37:59] them and hear them and
[38:00] you know and just get the taste of them
[38:02] i tell you it'll do you good praise
[38:04] lord it does something good for you just
[38:07] like this i say
[38:08] you know he said if you buy this or or
[38:10] just get to ignore
[38:11] your eyes you know and one of these days
[38:13] you'll see that it's understanding to
[38:15] you that's right
[38:16] i mean it begins don't move stuff until
[38:18] you it goes
[38:19] down in here you know it's got something
[38:21] to do with that amazing grace hey
[38:23] praise god hallelujah i once was blind
[38:27] but now i see
[38:28] amen you know that's the way god is
[38:30] beginning he showed me these things but
[38:32] he began to open my eyes you know to
[38:34] more truth and more life
[38:36] because it's a time i couldn't walk in
[38:38] it you know i couldn't
[38:39] put my life in it i couldn't place
[38:41] myself in
[38:42] and i know you you probably walked in
[38:44] the same pathway praise the lord
[38:47] but there's a time that you just didn't
[38:48] have what you got now
[38:50] amen i mean you knew god
[38:53] probably maybe was blessed by it right
[38:56] but today you were able to stand you
[38:58] know just like a little child when he's
[39:00] a growing up he
[39:01] he wants to do what his daddy his father
[39:04] wants
[39:05] his daddy does he wants to do the things
[39:08] he does he wants to
[39:10] walk in him and work in them and do what
[39:12] he wants to do but yet
[39:14] he has to learn these things you know
[39:16] it's a time that god has got to
[39:18] let us grow into a place that we'll
[39:20] learn to be solid and be walking in him
[39:22] praise the lord
[39:24] because we don't walk in him like we
[39:26] should you know at the beginning
[39:28] we have we think maybe we do it's just
[39:30] slightly i didn't want nobody much to
[39:31] tell me about god because i thought the
[39:33] boy
[39:34] had all i need you know i didn't need
[39:36] much yet
[39:37] but brother i found out that there's a
[39:39] lot about him i just didn't know him
[39:41] amen and old peter one time you know i
[39:44] was i was thinking about him where he
[39:46] was telling the lord when he found out
[39:47] that that jesus was gonna be delivered
[39:49] over to
[39:50] hands of man to be crucified and you
[39:53] know that was a sad thing you know peter
[39:55] said
[39:56] tell him he said kind of rebuking the
[39:57] lord what
[39:59] lord i don't never say nothing like it
[40:01] don't ever meet you nothing like that
[40:03] how you know jesus turned around he said
[40:05] satan
[40:06] get behind me cause you don't really
[40:10] know what i'm
[40:12] trying to say to you you know what was
[40:14] that's kind of rebuke wasn't it it's
[40:16] kind of a
[40:17] rebuke to i mean that was kind of hard
[40:19] because it would be hard today
[40:21] you know somebody just get up and say
[40:23] well let's try to
[40:25] do the best we can and somebody come
[40:26] along god sent them servant of god along
[40:29] or something
[40:30] he just say well listen you you just
[40:32] need to sit down and listen
[40:34] hurt your feelings a little bit you know
[40:36] because we thought we knowed everything
[40:37] you know
[40:38] but i i just i just like that you know
[40:41] he done me i believe like he did on
[40:42] peter
[40:44] i think he maybe he didn't just speak
[40:46] the words to me but
[40:48] in one sense it was just like that he
[40:50] said satan
[40:51] just get behind me you need to listen
[40:54] you know
[40:54] right and i thought about that i said oh
[40:56] my i thought i knew about everything you
[40:58] know i knew how to pray i knew how to
[41:00] let the holy spirit speak through me
[41:02] oh i just thought the boy is i got
[41:05] everything i'm ready to go to heaven now
[41:07] and you know i i i was really i guess if
[41:10] god would have took me on right now and
[41:12] i'd
[41:12] believe out of me right but you know i
[41:14] had to do some
[41:16] growing and listening and just getting
[41:18] more settled you know right
[41:20] i was just a little child i thought well
[41:23] man if daddy had put me out there on
[41:24] this car i'd erect and kill myself
[41:28] you know i wanted to drive a car and i
[41:29] wanted to do what he wanted me to but
[41:31] i just want matured enough i just didn't
[41:34] understand these things because
[41:36] i know the first time i got in a car and
[41:38] tried to grind i like to tour the
[41:39] transmission up you know they don't
[41:41] scratch stick things and
[41:42] let my clutch out too faster and then
[41:45] try to
[41:46] stop it without pushing the clutch in
[41:48] you know that thing was a hard thing to
[41:50] learn how to do something
[41:51] so i thought about just like that you
[41:54] know to get back to the word of god
[41:55] that's about the way i was in the words
[41:57] you know
[41:58] i just didn't know how to do things i
[42:00] didn't know how to handle myself and i
[42:02] didn't know how to
[42:03] get other people to see the truth about
[42:05] god's word
[42:06] come on if i just always stayed in this
[42:09] shout you know it's still a bit of shot
[42:10] and still wanting to know
[42:11] that right that's right you know because
[42:14] we're still being going on and just
[42:17] having a great time because
[42:19] we've all like felt like a boy if you
[42:21] could just speak in tongues and prophesy
[42:23] and
[42:23] dancing the spirit you know and just oh
[42:26] it was good you know
[42:27] right but you never get into the
[42:29] knowledge of the truth like that amen
[42:32] i mean you can shout because they people
[42:34] still shout in the day they still
[42:36] prophesying still having great emotions
[42:39] and still don't know god dude
[42:42] i feel his spirit but they don't really
[42:44] know come on brother
[42:45] i imagine these uh pharisees and
[42:47] sadducees back there you know when jesus
[42:50] come on the scene you know and
[42:51] come amongst them and walking with him
[42:53] and you know trying to explain thanks to
[42:56] him i guess he thought this was a bad
[42:57] church full of people how can these
[42:59] people
[43:00] be so ignorant you know how could they
[43:02] believe what moses said why couldn't
[43:04] they believe
[43:05] what these old prophets uh prophesied
[43:08] back through the scriptures you know
[43:09] about the coming of the lord and
[43:11] now i'm here and they don't even know me
[43:14] that's right
[43:16] said he come to his own his own didn't
[43:18] even know it didn't receive him did he
[43:21] you know it's sad for it to be like that
[43:22] you know and it would have happened here
[43:24] in our generation if god had
[43:26] done something to us come on if god
[43:29] hadn't got this i said
[43:30] to us tonight and somehow another
[43:32] opening
[43:33] you know if he had to let this uh
[43:36] revelation of god get to us brother and
[43:38] sister
[43:39] we'd have still been carried away with
[43:41] all kind of
[43:43] ideals and opinions but
[43:46] and things in the spirit we want to know
[43:48] which way to go
[43:49] you know it's hard today to deal with
[43:51] people i've been
[43:52] meeting a lot of people here lately and
[43:54] uh some of them
[43:56] uh inspectors or some big
[44:00] churches and been having kind of little
[44:02] discussions with them about
[44:04] things and god's letting me find favor
[44:06] with some of them
[44:07] but i tell you what they look at me and
[44:10] say well how do you know these things
[44:11] you know
[44:13] i said well it's only takes god you have
[44:16] to see how god's
[44:17] leading you to know things you know i
[44:20] mean if you can't see yourself in the
[44:21] word and see yourself
[44:23] before as god has predestinated you
[44:25] don't place you in the word
[44:27] you'll never be able to go nowhere with
[44:29] god you've got to see your
[44:31] predestination don't you
[44:33] you got to see your calling you got to
[44:34] recognize what god's called you for
[44:37] amen what he's purposed yet and how he's
[44:39] placed you in here praise the lord
[44:42] i mean we just think somebody's just
[44:43] hatched out you know
[44:45] god had us in his mind wig that came
[44:47] before the foundation of the earth he's
[44:49] and he's been up bringing us through all
[44:51] this eating through the jeans and
[44:53] bringing us on up here you know to hear
[44:56] in the last days he's kind of manifested
[44:58] what we are that's right
[45:00] if he can ever get us to see a picture
[45:02] who we are you know
[45:03] and recognize who we are in him praise
[45:06] god
[45:06] then i'll tell you what we're going to
[45:08] have a revival brother praise god
[45:10] hallelujah
[45:11] here little grab this brother say here
[45:13] not long ago he said this won't have a
[45:15] revival he said you know i got to
[45:16] thinking about that
[45:18] he said you know how we're going to have
[45:20] a revival
[45:21] he said man we need to find out that we
[45:23] are the revival amen
[45:25] praise god that's a difference hey it
[45:28] ain't just getting a big crowd of people
[45:30] together you know and having a good
[45:31] singing and having a good
[45:33] uh thing but it's when we really see who
[45:35] we are and what we're doing and how
[45:37] we're fulfilling the purpose of god
[45:39] listen i'll tell you what it gets rich
[45:42] in a sense
[45:43] you begin to see where you came from and
[45:45] where you're going to hallelujah
[45:47] you know i want to see where i came from
[45:49] don't you
[45:50] i know it's good to be under i guess old
[45:53] he and a little wall
[45:56] and you know scratch around in some of
[45:58] the earthly things we all
[46:00] fulfill that purpose i guess but oh i
[46:02] believe god's trying to get us to
[46:04] lift up our wings now don't you i
[46:06] believe he's trying to get us to hear
[46:08] his voice hallelujah
[46:10] i believe that mother eagle that great
[46:12] eagle has come and screamed out to us
[46:14] amen
[46:15] i was preaching here a while back on
[46:16] elijah i said how elisha was a father
[46:19] elijah and i said you know
[46:21] when you go to reading this and finding
[46:22] all the things that elijah was
[46:24] in and how had gotten used to him found
[46:26] through the scriptures to
[46:28] uh to give to minister to people and
[46:30] give life to the people
[46:32] i said you know we ain't got but one
[46:34] source today
[46:35] i said we ain't got but one way to get
[46:37] through into life today and that's
[46:39] through this message amen
[46:41] voice of god that's the only way we're
[46:43] going to get there hallelujah
[46:46] i know we started off i believe god
[46:48] poured out his spirit upon all flesh and
[46:50] i believe everybody
[46:52] has had the privilege or had the
[46:54] opportunity of being filled with the
[46:56] spirit amen or getting the baptism of it
[46:59] i mean that you under you could just
[47:01] used to have revivals brother brown
[47:03] and all the old servants of god back
[47:06] counter they had
[47:06] great revivals that i mean far i know a
[47:09] lot of them i could call their names you
[47:10] probably know them
[47:12] but they had revivals they had
[47:14] outpourings of the spirit you know
[47:16] but really they hadn't become the
[47:18] revival
[47:19] no money come on you know it's different
[47:21] than having a
[47:22] outpouring of the spirit when god pours
[47:24] his spirit up on all flesh you know and
[47:27] you know what i that what really got a
[47:29] hold of my heart i was telling my
[47:30] brother here before service
[47:32] how did god let me get a hold of a
[47:34] message one time
[47:36] about the anointed ones at the end time
[47:38] because i was a kind of
[47:40] men my wife and we used to be at a lot
[47:43] of pentecostal meetings and
[47:45] over the different ministers and
[47:46] different brothers and
[47:48] always having great meetings and
[47:51] revivals and what we thought was
[47:53] revivals
[47:54] but it didn't last long you know i mean
[47:56] you can get
[47:57] healed every day and still be lost like
[48:00] a brother tell me he said you know
[48:02] a sinners you know i'll tell you what
[48:05] god heals sinners and everybody though
[48:08] you don't have to be a real holy
[48:09] ghost-filled person to get healed right
[48:12] man you can build me to start in the
[48:13] country and be still be healed
[48:16] listen that's what had me kind of
[48:19] blinded because i
[48:20] i saw this going on across the country
[48:22] you know and
[48:23] and i it got me a place i really didn't
[48:25] know what kind of revival to look for
[48:28] man i just i didn't know what to do you
[48:31] know but i was
[48:32] trying to stay with everything that i
[48:34] thought was moving on in god and i just
[48:36] got into
[48:37] i thought prosperity and and all this
[48:40] stuff you know i thought boy if you just
[48:41] give god a hundred dollars you'll be a
[48:43] millionaire you know
[48:45] he'll give you a new cadillac and a nice
[48:47] new home
[48:48] and all this stuff but i found that that
[48:49] didn't work too good
[48:51] you know if you give it to god it might
[48:53] work but i was giving most of mine to
[48:55] the preachers you know
[48:57] as well as it get rich it wasn't what
[49:00] the lord didn't need that you know
[49:02] i found that out a little later on down
[49:03] in my life you know because i'd give a
[49:05] lot of money away to
[49:07] kind of you know i just thought god's
[49:09] gonna just bless me like that i might
[49:11] able to get blessed you know
[49:13] and god saw my little weak ignorant ways
[49:16] but i
[49:16] i've done all i could i was doing all i
[49:19] could you know to
[49:20] get in the program and get in what i
[49:22] needed to thought that i
[49:23] i wanted to get to heaven i wanted to
[49:26] get as many people as i could
[49:27] in and but i going act the wrong way
[49:30] you know god is he's got to get us
[49:33] around these things sometimes
[49:34] and get us to show us where he's leading
[49:36] us to though
[49:37] that's kind of like peter was he thought
[49:39] boy i got a
[49:41] i know god how could you say that this
[49:44] thing's gonna happen to you hey could
[49:45] you do these things
[49:47] he said don't even say that because he
[49:49] saw so many miracles and so many banks
[49:51] happening
[49:52] all these great explosions and god the
[49:55] dead rays and the blind the sea and
[49:58] the crippled walk and he just couldn't
[50:00] accept this you know he said man
[50:02] how can a man like this going to be
[50:04] tucked in the hands of people to be
[50:05] crucified or
[50:07] or he took away how could this thing
[50:08] happen
[50:10] he didn't realize that was what he was
[50:12] doing it party
[50:14] he just hadn't come to the understanding
[50:17] to see it
[50:18] this was a plan of god you know amen if
[50:22] he hadn't done that there wouldn't have
[50:23] been no hope for peter would
[50:25] would have been no hope for you and me
[50:27] you know but god had to let this happen
[50:30] but out without understanding what he
[50:32] was saying
[50:33] he said he looked around at old peter he
[50:35] said satan just get behind
[50:38] that mean peter was a devil but he just
[50:41] had his mind on the wrong motive did he
[50:44] you know it's kind of hard for us to see
[50:46] that sometime because
[50:47] a lot of times that we we got to get our
[50:49] mind focused in the right pattern that
[50:52] when the right moment you praise the
[50:53] lord
[50:54] because that's what god had to do to me
[50:56] because i didn't understand these things
[50:59] about the water baptism and all these
[51:01] things
[51:02] god had the mysteries of god and
[51:04] different things about how god was to
[51:06] reveal himself to me
[51:08] i just didn't have this inside of him my
[51:11] thinking wasn't like that you know
[51:13] but god had to get around to this he had
[51:15] to have a way to bring me around to it
[51:18] he just didn't cram it all in
[51:19] at one time but i was in little services
[51:22] uh
[51:23] for wherever i'd go god would let me get
[51:26] into some of them
[51:27] so i got in one toughing for a while and
[51:29] that was my brother ned allison i don't
[51:31] know anybody knows him at all
[51:34] boy he was a real hard teacher he just
[51:37] about tell me he'd say satan get behind
[51:39] him
[51:40] you know because i disargued with him
[51:43] and i
[51:43] he tell me boy you just said you know
[51:46] you
[51:47] well after 63 years you couldn't really
[51:50] see what god was really doing you know
[51:52] and i just couldn't accept that i
[51:53] thought man
[51:55] i needed i had gone away back younger
[51:57] you know i said i told him i said you
[51:59] might not know brother but
[52:01] i know you know but he has kind of
[52:03] showed me something you know that i
[52:05] didn't understand
[52:06] because i had never come to the water
[52:07] baptism 1972
[52:10] and this is when god open again don't
[52:13] mess up to me
[52:15] a big snow was on the ground about this
[52:17] time too you know well if you don't get
[52:18] in there when god wants you to he'll
[52:20] he'll get you in his way but there's a
[52:24] big snow about 17 inches deeper there's
[52:26] never been a snow like that in augusta
[52:28] georgie
[52:30] but i'll tell y'all sitting at the table
[52:31] when god began to
[52:33] that good old last night went to work
[52:35] amen
[52:36] thank god my understanding began to open
[52:39] up to the scripture praise the lord
[52:41] i began to read i said oh god i've never
[52:44] really been buried in you lord i've
[52:45] never really
[52:47] had that experience you know i've been
[52:49] baptized in water
[52:51] and i thought it was a great thing back
[52:52] then it was you know
[52:54] and i believe if i went on back then
[52:56] like i believe like broadband told that
[52:58] brother that time he's worried about his
[53:00] daddy
[53:00] got a pole and hadn't been baptized you
[53:03] know but
[53:04] brother brown said listen don't you
[53:06] worry about it he'll be there
[53:08] bless him because he knew that down the
[53:10] road that that man would have
[53:11] if he'd lived i'm no of those saints if
[53:14] they have been here tonight
[53:15] if they have been living right here and
[53:17] hearing this good teaching of the word
[53:18] of god that you and i've got
[53:20] god give us that i believe that i said
[53:22] amen to the word praise the lord amen i
[53:24] believe better tuck it because they
[53:26] some of them wanted to really serve god
[53:29] some of them their whole heart was to
[53:31] to be in the will of god you know and
[53:33] live the life of the lord jesus christ
[53:35] them
[53:36] never will forget i sit in there at the
[53:38] table
[53:39] and that big old snow i didn't know
[53:41] brother ned ivis and brother glenn doyle
[53:43] and i'm at that time
[53:44] we're sitting there and reading and
[53:46] praying and
[53:48] somebody gave me the tape of brother
[53:49] brown i mean that really quickened to me
[53:52] and i said lord i need to call somebody
[53:54] i need to find out if there's anybody
[53:55] can baptize us to name the lord jesus
[53:57] christ
[53:59] boy i called up somebody told me about
[54:01] this little fellow said he come out of
[54:02] the church of god and they
[54:04] turned him out and said that he's got a
[54:06] little church back here somewhere in
[54:08] this house and said
[54:10] i know he believes like that you know
[54:12] and i will forget that and
[54:14] him and brother that i was having a
[54:16] service
[54:18] during this house so i called him in
[54:21] that snow i said surely ain't nobody

[54:32] i called him up he said brother you
[54:33] ready to go
[54:36] you know i guess i was kind of hoping
[54:37] he'd say wait in the sunshine but
[54:40] he said yes brother said right now he
[54:42] said that prophet said when you see
[54:44] these things you know you better get
[54:45] there as fast as you can
[54:47] so boy i know that i saw it hey man i
[54:50] couldn't sit still i wasn't
[54:52] i'd lost my alpha type for everything
[54:54] else and i had to get in this praise god
[54:57] i told my wife i said honey you ready to
[54:59] go of course she didn't know what to

[56:55] me begin to show me things
[56:57] i begin to turn my old bible back

[57:09] killer but the spirit gives you life
[57:11] hallelujah and i uh boy what really got

[57:22] to get to heaven

[57:27] said what are we gonna do now
[57:29] you know i was kind of confused about
[57:30] that brother hallelujah
[57:32] i said now if heavens and earth's gonna
[57:35] pass away
[57:36] where else could we go to i found out
[57:40] that he wants us to get in his word
[57:41] don't amen
[57:43] man let this word get settled in her
[57:45] spirit in her heart
[57:46] because that's him that's right i tell

[57:49] i have a little my little family
[57:52] sometimes i have to
[57:54] i get rough with them i know i about
[57:57] believe in the word of god you know
[57:59] sometimes we
[58:00] get sick you know and we forget to i
[58:03] don't want the word a bit
[58:04] not a fact to me and you know sometimes
[58:07] if we ain't careful
[58:08] this whole thing will get to a place
[58:10] we've heard it so much and
[58:12] handle it so much you know and and heard
[58:15] somebody explain it and tell us
[58:18] about it that sometimes it just gets to
[58:20] be a form foreign amen
[58:23] more than a life you know right
[58:26] you know i see people today i i it hurts
[58:29] me sometimes when we go
[58:31] a lot of the used to go to a lot of the
[58:33] meetings where they had the big crowds
[58:35] of people in
[58:36] the message you know but i'd listen to
[58:39] the ministers and
[58:40] a lot of times they got to where they
[58:42] got off on little issues or something
[58:44] would argue about the word of god and
[58:46] you know kind of pull something maybe on
[58:48] somebody or get somebody to
[58:50] agree with what they're saying i said
[58:52] that just don't sound
[58:53] too good you know and i got to
[58:57] place to where i kind of losing my
[58:59] appetite to go
[59:00] to some of the conventions the last
[59:02] things i see in but you know i said how
[59:04] could
[59:04] if a devil can candy's gonna separate
[59:07] every little body of christ he's gonna
[59:09] he's gonna cause little things to happen
[59:11] and kill the fellowship
[59:13] out and kill out the love that we need
[59:16] for
[59:16] god you know but i'll tell you what if
[59:19] we ever get in love with him you'll love
[59:20] everybody
[59:22] amen praise god you just can't hit
[59:25] i've been loving this brother here now
[59:27] ever since i met my way back out of when
[59:29] i
[59:29] god opened up my eyes and got me to
[59:31] going the right way and brother dale and
[59:34] them i just got in my soul i
[59:36] can't help from loving them brother
[59:38] hey man we might not all be the getter
[59:41] but they somedays
[59:42] there's a bounding in there there's a
[59:44] love in there
[59:45] amen just bonding us together you know
[59:48] thank god it's real hallelujah
[59:50] it's something that's keeping us and
[59:52] it's making us
[59:53] look over sometimes we might not all
[59:56] wear the same kind of clothes or maybe
[59:58] drive the same kind of car and some
[1:00:00] might not live in the same kind of house
[1:00:02] but we gotta
[1:00:03] love our praise god that all of it
[1:00:05] belongs to one another amen
[1:00:09] i used to i think but boy you know i
[1:00:12] found out where the bible said not to
[1:00:14] covet you know
[1:00:16] you see some of the brothers seem like
[1:00:17] they're just blessed better than he was
[1:00:19] and
[1:00:20] you know you just thought it's awfully
[1:00:22] easy to cover that amen
[1:00:24] i found out boy i just need to get
[1:00:26] probably a little closer to him
[1:00:29] amen and i i found out that you know
[1:00:32] if you get the covenants and fangs and
[1:00:35] god certainly want us to do that
[1:00:38] because like a brother told me down here
[1:00:40] tonight he said you know i've never seen
[1:00:41] one of god's children beg for breakfast
[1:00:44] something wrong with them if they do
[1:00:45] anything because god's gonna look after
[1:00:48] his own ain't
[1:00:49] right i know we all get down sometime we
[1:00:51] didn't got
[1:00:52] our things maybe that we need and i
[1:00:54] guess god's got a purpose for that maybe
[1:00:56] we didn't go through some hard times we
[1:00:58] won't know how to help other people to
[1:01:00] go through it
[1:01:01] but always sometimes i know maybe we
[1:01:04] don't get
[1:01:05] have good jobs like when could need or
[1:01:07] somebody
[1:01:08] blessed us we got it blessed but we want
[1:01:10] to be thankful for every little thing
[1:01:12] with god
[1:01:12] praise god because there ain't going to
[1:01:14] be no little use and big eyes
[1:01:16] in god listen you might not think that
[1:01:19] you
[1:01:20] got as much of this but you just as real
[1:01:22] as they are
[1:01:23] amen praise god hallelujah if god's
[1:01:26] called us and placed us in the kingdom
[1:01:28] of god and we're part of him brother and
[1:01:31] sister
[1:01:31] you're going to be just as great as
[1:01:33] anybody praise god
[1:01:35] i've learned that i wanted to be more of
[1:01:36] a servant than you know than anything
[1:01:38] right you know what a lot of times we
[1:01:43] we don't realize that being a servant is
[1:01:45] about the best thing we could be
[1:01:47] right you know every a lot of people
[1:01:50] wants to be the one that's you know that
[1:01:52] maybe it's
[1:01:53] the head but listen i just love to be a
[1:01:55] servant if i could you know praise god
[1:01:57] just to help somebody
[1:01:59] you know if i could just help the least
[1:02:00] of god's children
[1:02:02] help them to see the word of god help
[1:02:04] them to understand more about the lord
[1:02:05] jesus christ
[1:02:07] and more about the faith of god it does
[1:02:09] me more good than anything
[1:02:11] that's better than having riches or
[1:02:12] anything to give me
[1:02:14] praise god and whatever god wants you to
[1:02:17] have i'll guarantee you'll have it
[1:02:18] praise the lord
[1:02:20] brother ain't going to give you
[1:02:21] something you don't need on it he's
[1:02:22] going to
[1:02:23] give you just exactly what you need he
[1:02:25] knows some of us is not able maybe to
[1:02:28] to handle things like others somebody a
[1:02:31] lot of people they know how to handle
[1:02:33] things you know gordon
[1:02:34] others do i guess if i had just
[1:02:37] everything i just give it out and
[1:02:39] you don't want to have nothing left
[1:02:40] praise god because i've always
[1:02:43] felt like brother branham you know he
[1:02:44] didn't much much in this world
[1:02:48] i mean he they tried to build him big
[1:02:50] houses want to put him in a place where
[1:02:52] his having a guard at the gates and
[1:02:54] things he said how could i want
[1:02:56] something like that that's right
[1:02:58] i don't that desire or nothing like that
[1:03:00] he said i don't have to have a place to
[1:03:02] where
[1:03:02] the children of god when they need
[1:03:05] prayer for sickness and
[1:03:06] need something from god they have to go
[1:03:08] through some kind of a guard or
[1:03:10] some kind of a thing to get to me he
[1:03:13] said
[1:03:13] i don't want that but he could have done
[1:03:15] that couldn't
[1:03:16] i mean that people would give him
[1:03:18] anything they offered to give him a
[1:03:20] million dollars and
[1:03:21] give him a new car maybe every year some
[1:03:24] kind of a big cadillac or something
[1:03:25] right in or
[1:03:27] he said how could i want something like
[1:03:28] that he said how would i feel when i go
[1:03:31] down the road and see the little old
[1:03:32] precious
[1:03:33] mother that's been over an old wash tub
[1:03:35] on a washboard or scrubbing
[1:03:38] he said how would i feel have a urchin
[1:03:41] some kind of a fella to drive me around
[1:03:43] this big cadillac and
[1:03:44] you know i was in some meetings one time
[1:03:47] on the saviors
[1:03:48] and i heard this preacher they got the
[1:03:50] preaching prosperity and they take up
[1:03:52] offense and wash tubs i mean i saw him
[1:03:55] fill up a wash tub full of philharmonic
[1:03:58] blessing and you don't got to preach it
[1:04:01] if you'd give to god and
[1:04:03] pull people and give everything they had
[1:04:04] you know just put all the hat
[1:04:06] in thinking that this was god you know
[1:04:09] then that preacher get up and you say i
[1:04:11] won't let my mother even let my dogs
[1:04:13] live in y'all's house
[1:04:16] i thought oh god how could people make a
[1:04:18] statement like that
[1:04:19] brother who would want something like
[1:04:22] that
[1:04:23] anybody that could even see it all or
[1:04:25] know that that wouldn't be god
[1:04:28] but people was deceived with things like
[1:04:29] that you know they was
[1:04:31] hindered and a lot of poor people
[1:04:33] they're not even serving god today
[1:04:35] because of things that was
[1:04:36] brought out to them like that a lot of
[1:04:38] them turned back you know a lot of them
[1:04:40] turned away from the leadership that
[1:04:42] they did have
[1:04:44] and never did get back right with god i
[1:04:46] know a lot of them that done it
[1:04:48] because they just felt like oh god if
[1:04:51] you don't care
[1:04:51] more about me than that then lord i
[1:04:53] don't need the certainty
[1:04:55] but see that ain't god god cures for you
[1:04:58] praise the lord
[1:04:59] and i tell you what i know you'll
[1:05:01] prosper god said if you
[1:05:03] would serve me and you don't believe in
[1:05:05] when you do that he said
[1:05:06] thou would above all things you prosper
[1:05:09] and be in hell praise the lord
[1:05:10] i believe god will do that part of you
[1:05:12] anyway
[1:05:13] i believe he'll give you help and i
[1:05:15] believe he'll prosper you and
[1:05:17] i mean he's gonna give you all the
[1:05:18] world's richest in here because he knows
[1:05:21] that you don't need him doesn't it
[1:05:24] i mean you just don't need but just
[1:05:25] watch him get violent
[1:05:28] man get unpacked from this world you
[1:05:30] know if he loved the world and the
[1:05:31] things of the world he said the love of
[1:05:33] god is not even in you
[1:05:35] i'm not packing up to get up there i'm
[1:05:36] gonna get unpacked that i can't go there
[1:05:38] praise the lord
[1:05:40] because these things is weights to us
[1:05:42] amen all this little stuff
[1:05:44] i tell you you have to pay taxes only if
[1:05:46] you have a thousand acres you're gonna
[1:05:47] have to pay taxes on you got a big
[1:05:50] home maybe a mansion or something you're
[1:05:53] gonna have to pay taxes on
[1:05:54] so there ain't no way around there darty
[1:05:56] you're gonna have to this thing's gonna
[1:05:58] hold on you i mean
[1:05:59] the devil he can cause you to prosper
[1:06:02] too if you didn't
[1:06:05] like he tried to get jesus to fall for
[1:06:07] that didn't he
[1:06:08] right he tried his best to get him to
[1:06:11] use a little bit his power you know to
[1:06:13] just perform a few miracles and he done
[1:06:15] that on preachers and boy they failed
[1:06:16] for it that's true
[1:06:18] i mean over the country if you just go
[1:06:20] back and get them in your mind you see
[1:06:22] where
[1:06:22] many of them fell for that it didn't
[1:06:25] take much
[1:06:25] showing them boy they just went right
[1:06:27] into it didn't it
[1:06:29] i mean they learned that you could have
[1:06:30] these riches and get it
[1:06:32] you know rob god's people and take from
[1:06:34] them you know and
[1:06:36] and well maybe not all together god's
[1:06:38] people because
[1:06:39] god's people don't get wise enough to
[1:06:41] not fall for that stuff after all
[1:06:43] amen it might take a little bit more
[1:06:45] this i say but we'll listen he'll
[1:06:47] finally he'll get her understanding open
[1:06:49] on it praise god
[1:06:51] god when you give to god and stand
[1:06:53] behind the word of god and
[1:06:55] and use it like god tells you to you'll
[1:06:57] be blessed
[1:06:58] amen brother god's gonna bless you
[1:07:01] everywhere you go
[1:07:02] hallelujah i was a preacher the other
[1:07:04] night on the
[1:07:06] where jesus well under sunday morning i
[1:07:08] believe it was week before last
[1:07:11] about jesus when that blind
[1:07:14] man was sorry you know when jesus spit
[1:07:16] up on the ground and took some of that
[1:07:18] old
[1:07:19] uh clay and mixed it up with that spit a
[1:07:21] little bit
[1:07:22] put it on his eyes you know what he told
[1:07:25] him said you just go down
[1:07:27] that pool way then i see it you know and
[1:07:29] just wash your eyes and you'll be all
[1:07:31] right
[1:07:32] it don't take much to get a miracle if
[1:07:34] you want one does it right
[1:07:36] just believe him praise god just take
[1:07:38] what he says
[1:07:40] and you know i've been i thought i was
[1:07:42] bringing it out tomorrow and i said
[1:07:43] listen
[1:07:44] when you need something from god if
[1:07:45] you'll be willing to take what it gives
[1:07:47] you
[1:07:48] i mean it might not be the best thing
[1:07:50] that you
[1:07:51] think that you'd like to have but when
[1:07:53] god gives you something
[1:07:54] take it praise the lord believe it amen
[1:07:57] i'll tell you sometimes it might be a
[1:08:00] rebuking or something but if you'll take
[1:08:01] that god will do something for you
[1:08:04] hallelujah it's hard to take rebuking
[1:08:06] sometimes hey
[1:08:07] i mean it's hard to get corrected
[1:08:09] sometimes
[1:08:10] it's always been hard for me back when i
[1:08:12] was little it was hard to get corrected
[1:08:14] you know
[1:08:15] but i thought that was a horrible thing
[1:08:17] to have to get corrected
[1:08:18] but sometimes you know we because we may
[1:08:21] be not seeing things or not
[1:08:23] growing like we should or getting in a
[1:08:25] position we need to be in
[1:08:26] sometimes god corrects us don't us and
[1:08:29] he'll
[1:08:30] he'll give us a little whip and you know
[1:08:31] he'll let us see that where are we at
[1:08:34] you know praise the lord if it wasn't
[1:08:35] for that we wouldn't know where we that
[1:08:38] but god sometimes has to do that praise
[1:08:40] the lord
[1:08:41] because i was thinking about the the
[1:08:44] little eagles how did they
[1:08:45] cut some used to their nest you know
[1:08:48] that good furry
[1:08:49] nest and softness in it how nice it was
[1:08:52] to jump the good
[1:08:53] soft nest and boy wasn't my mother's
[1:08:56] eagle and father eagle they know what to
[1:08:58] do dude that's right
[1:09:00] man they got tournaments just jumping in
[1:09:01] there and when they get out and do his
[1:09:03] work you know
[1:09:04] so what they do they just pulled the fur
[1:09:06] out and let him jump on the thorns a few
[1:09:08] times
[1:09:09] oh i'll tell you what that got his
[1:09:11] attention
[1:09:12] that's the way god has to do sometimes
[1:09:14] his little body you know he has to
[1:09:16] pull that fur out you know praise the
[1:09:18] lord i tell you what my
[1:09:20] it's like my girls some of my will get
[1:09:23] to preaching so hard against
[1:09:25] sin and you know the whirly boys and
[1:09:28] things that sat here in the world and
[1:09:31] now that's uh just stop living right
[1:09:34] you know we just get to preaching so
[1:09:36] hard against it sometimes and
[1:09:38] they wonder if they're going to ever get
[1:09:40] married you know some of them got up to
[1:09:41] about 30 years old and still haven't
[1:09:43] gotten married yet
[1:09:44] but you know what i believe we want to
[1:09:47] wait till the right one comes along
[1:09:49] amen i believe we need to wait praise
[1:09:51] god
[1:09:52] i'll tell you god's got that little part
[1:09:54] of the other part for you if you don't
[1:09:56] get him here you'll have him over there
[1:09:58] if you don't get her here she'll be over
[1:10:00] there for you
[1:10:01] god's got one for every person you know
[1:10:04] he's got plenty enough to go around
[1:10:06] some of them today satisfied with one
[1:10:08] they just get four or five you know
[1:10:10] but listen brother and sister i believe
[1:10:12] we were to build oneness don't you
[1:10:14] thank god i always believed in oneness
[1:10:17] amen
[1:10:18] and i believe it's yeah i believe that
[1:10:20] god's just gonna let us have one
[1:10:22] hallelujah
[1:10:23] i i know sometimes if we ain't careful
[1:10:26] we'll get the devil and get us
[1:10:27] different ideals and get things
[1:10:29] happening and
[1:10:31] this stuff we're leaving in a time when
[1:10:32] all this stuff is coming right up to the
[1:10:35] in here because we'll manifest
[1:10:37] manifesting time it's time for
[1:10:39] everything and all this stuff that we're
[1:10:41] going through now we're going through
[1:10:42] pressures in the world
[1:10:44] and all of us are piling up right here
[1:10:46] at the end time
[1:10:47] talking to a little brother down there
[1:10:49] yesterday i believe it was
[1:10:51] no preacher he said brother i've been
[1:10:54] trying to preach here for the last
[1:10:56] six months or something like that he
[1:10:57] said i've been seeing
[1:10:59] what's happening right here at the end
[1:11:01] time amongst the bride you know
[1:11:03] how these things are getting uh to us
[1:11:06] you know and we don't even see what's
[1:11:08] happening we don't understand that god
[1:11:10] is trying to
[1:11:11] get us redeemed you know instead of that
[1:11:13] we're getting bound down with things
[1:11:16] i didn't understand what he was talking
[1:11:17] about right and then
[1:11:19] but i know that they different doctrines
[1:11:21] and things are going on empty
[1:11:24] i mean all kinds of things are happening
[1:11:27] it ain't god it's you know the devil
[1:11:29] gets the offer of confusion amongst the
[1:11:31] people sometimes
[1:11:32] and he'll cause us to get uh ideal or
[1:11:34] about something that the prophet may be
[1:11:36] mentioned or
[1:11:38] or something other that he didn't you
[1:11:40] know he didn't say it's the same the
[1:11:41] lord and thanks and
[1:11:42] you know different subjects and we try
[1:11:45] to build something around it you know
[1:11:47] if we ain't careful we'll build a big
[1:11:49] old fence or a barn and we'll pull a lot
[1:11:52] of people into it
[1:11:54] but if it takes away the love and
[1:11:55] fellowship from our brothers and fans we
[1:11:57] better leave it along
[1:12:00] i don't believe that god wants nobody to
[1:12:01] build a barn and
[1:12:03] get our big fence and put a city you
[1:12:05] know and that's what happened to the
[1:12:07] nomination i looked under that i
[1:12:08] i listened sometimes i just had the
[1:12:11] radio list this little
[1:12:12] station over here in south carolina has
[1:12:14] some good singing and
[1:12:16] i mean every preacher comes on and got a
[1:12:19] different name
[1:12:20] a different denominational name
[1:12:24] i thought oh my he tell us something i
[1:12:26] never thought i'd seen that amongst the
[1:12:28] baptist people
[1:12:29] yeah i mean the pentecost as you expect
[1:12:31] anything
[1:12:32] but dad i never could because there's
[1:12:34] always more solids you seem like about
[1:12:36] what they're seeing what they belong to
[1:12:38] but you know what they had
[1:12:40] i bet you on that one station and during
[1:12:43] the day
[1:12:44] you'd hear probably a different hundred
[1:12:46] ministers that comes on there and
[1:12:48] everyone's
[1:12:48] got a different name for their churches
[1:12:51] i thought oh my
[1:12:53] you know what think about all these
[1:12:55] things that's happening and it's about
[1:12:56] like that about
[1:12:57] monk sobriety i mean amongst the message
[1:13:01] people
[1:13:02] because it's got different little ideas
[1:13:04] and different opinions you know
[1:13:06] different things of
[1:13:07] saying well this is the way it is and
[1:13:09] that kind of got me
[1:13:11] heard about some of the meetings we used
[1:13:13] to have the big meetings and
[1:13:14] i for a while i backed off and i just
[1:13:17] plumb quit going to
[1:13:18] any of the beats convention meetings i
[1:13:21] just and some of the fellowship not the
[1:13:23] fellowship but the minister's meetings
[1:13:25] because of little subjects coming up and
[1:13:27] i didn't see
[1:13:28] i mean i know we need to know what we're
[1:13:30] doing god don't want no ignorant people
[1:13:33] if you're eating it he'll get us give us
[1:13:35] some wisdom on it amen
[1:13:37] and i i feel needed that myself but you
[1:13:39] know just different things that comes up
[1:13:42] and
[1:13:42] and like like oh brother homer said is
[1:13:44] that the church here a few weeks ago
[1:13:47] he said brother he said i don't want
[1:13:50] nobody sheep but mine
[1:13:53] so if you think i'll come here to steal
[1:13:54] your sheep he said you got the wrong
[1:13:56] idea he said i can't pastor nobody's but
[1:13:59] mine
[1:13:59] amen i thought now boy that's good and
[1:14:02] praise god
[1:14:03] hallelujah but you know it ain't like
[1:14:06] that this
[1:14:07] we had one or two leave our church here
[1:14:08] lately one space sleeping with us a good
[1:14:11] fall
[1:14:12] but he i guess he might have told the
[1:14:14] truth he said
[1:14:15] i have a little brother he said brother
[1:14:17] collins just ain't preaching deep in
[1:14:18] that fart
[1:14:19] i thought i was preaching everything i
[1:14:21] know you know
[1:14:24] and uh he said these think hearted deep
[1:14:26] enough
[1:14:27] and i said well oh my made me kind of
[1:14:29] feel ashamed of myself i said lord
[1:14:31] please get me where i need to be god let
[1:14:34] me rise up to that place that i need to
[1:14:36] be
[1:14:36] but one person i can get in let me get
[1:14:39] that in you know if it's my wife you
[1:14:41] know
[1:14:41] i sure want to be able to get her in and
[1:14:44] i said lord if
[1:14:45] i can't feed nobody with her and just
[1:14:48] god if you've called me to be a
[1:14:50] minister and call me to to be a pastor
[1:14:53] lord
[1:14:53] please let me get to the place that i
[1:14:56] need to be
[1:14:57] right you know what nasa but i pray all
[1:15:00] the time i say oh
[1:15:01] god i said i might not be able to
[1:15:02] explain things like other people
[1:15:05] might not be able to get my message
[1:15:07] together like them but i
[1:15:08] i got to i got to where i get these
[1:15:11] little books out you know and i'd use
[1:15:13] them
[1:15:13] yeah man i'll tell you i don't believe
[1:15:17] you want something to clack dust do you
[1:15:18] that's right i get them out of hammer
[1:15:21] service i get them and i'll
[1:15:23] when i preach it i've got to find
[1:15:25] something you know as i read the little
[1:15:26] taxi cup then i
[1:15:28] i get my bible here and i kind of bring
[1:15:30] it out the word of god
[1:15:32] then a lot of times if i i'll read what
[1:15:35] he says about it because that's what we
[1:15:36] need to hear
[1:15:38] i'll tell you when elijah god raised him
[1:15:40] up here to
[1:15:41] get us in to bring a message to us we
[1:15:43] better listen to what he says
[1:15:45] right brother i'll tell you it better be
[1:15:47] a i know brother brown make my absolute
[1:15:49] you know far as a man
[1:15:51] but i tell you what he's showing me to
[1:15:53] absolutely amen amen he had him
[1:15:55] inside it that's right and that's he
[1:15:57] always pointed us back you know one time
[1:15:59] he's making a statement he said
[1:16:01] where could i send you to today he said
[1:16:04] could i point you to
[1:16:06] the brown tablet he said no he said that
[1:16:09] thing just as that is arrested
[1:16:12] he said where could i point you to he
[1:16:14] said i can't torture that he said but
[1:16:15] there's one place i can he said this to
[1:16:17] the lord jesus christ
[1:16:18] back to this word hallelujah you know if
[1:16:21] we can get somebody back in the word of
[1:16:23] god and get them to see
[1:16:24] what they are and let them see that god
[1:16:26] still alive is still real amen
[1:16:29] brother that's all that's going to
[1:16:30] matter and he'll help you if you read
[1:16:32] them little messages and and listen to
[1:16:34] them i'll tell you what
[1:16:36] i when you catch a hold of it and see
[1:16:38] that god was speaking you know
[1:16:40] it's not just a man it wasn't just
[1:16:42] brother brown but it was god speaking
[1:16:44] fruit
[1:16:45] hallelujah and that got me more that
[1:16:48] really struck me hard kind of like he
[1:16:49] did old peter and he said satan get
[1:16:51] behind me because
[1:16:52] there's a time i wouldn't have followed
[1:16:54] it like i need to
[1:16:56] there's a time i wouldn't have applied
[1:16:58] it to me like i went to the message you
[1:17:00] know and
[1:17:01] things like little things in here i'd
[1:17:03] say well maybe it just ain't as serious
[1:17:05] as he says it you know but it is
[1:17:08] i'll tell you right now you don't find
[1:17:10] many flaws in that prophet's message
[1:17:13] you don't find too many things in there
[1:17:15] that ain't really got
[1:17:16] god in it you know i mean there might be
[1:17:19] a few things was god was bringing him up
[1:17:21] and showing him
[1:17:22] about the seals and about the horse
[1:17:24] riders and things
[1:17:25] you know that god had to show him you
[1:17:27] know had to really bring the light to
[1:17:29] him and show him the truths of it
[1:17:31] when he was trying to get it from other
[1:17:33] men you know he's trying to get to
[1:17:34] revelation from other great men
[1:17:36] but god let him know that it was going
[1:17:38] to take him to bring it forth hallelujah
[1:17:40] it's going to take
[1:17:41] god to do it and that's the way it's
[1:17:43] going to take today if without
[1:17:44] god you know we'll we might just get
[1:17:47] into anything you can take one day's
[1:17:48] little message and build your
[1:17:49] church thank god you take a little
[1:17:54] message here and just build you up a big
[1:17:55] church out of it and call yourself this
[1:17:57] or then
[1:17:58] but without the holy spirit without god
[1:18:00] of being there you know
[1:18:02] we'll get in the mess won't we right
[1:18:04] that's right god
[1:18:05] is trying to get our minds back to his
[1:18:07] word back to him
[1:18:08] praise the lord you know there's a time
[1:18:12] i followed him in
[1:18:13] like a shatter like peter did i'd get
[1:18:16] off and
[1:18:16] i really wasn't identified with a
[1:18:18] message like i ought to be but i was
[1:18:20] walking in the shadow of it brother
[1:18:22] i mean i was standing out there to
[1:18:23] shatter but when i seen it it's going to
[1:18:25] take a crucifixion to me
[1:18:27] and when i seen what was going to really
[1:18:29] happen boy
[1:18:31] i had to really get birthed again hey
[1:18:33] man
[1:18:34] oh peter walked around and shattered him
[1:18:36] a long time didn't
[1:18:38] right but when he seen how he was
[1:18:39] delivered up to be crucified then
[1:18:42] peter began to kind of say well man i
[1:18:45] you know he's a good man but i just
[1:18:48] can't be crucified with
[1:18:50] i just can't let this man if they're
[1:18:52] gonna crucify him they'll do it to me
[1:18:54] too
[1:18:54] you know what he'll sure get you
[1:18:56] crucified want it
[1:18:58] when you get really in the message
[1:18:59] you'll be crucified right

[1:19:03] life here to bring
[1:19:04] to have it in him praise god as long as

[1:19:47] under somewhere another

[1:21:23] to fall into
[1:21:25] and be led by the spirit of god amen man

[1:21:31] us
[1:21:31] and you know the greatest battle the
[1:21:32] prophet of god said ever fought was your
[1:21:34] mind i guess you sold it

[1:21:40] things you know he likes to keep things
[1:21:42] and

[1:22:26] things accurate but god's word aren't it
[1:22:29] you know it's going to take this word to
[1:22:30] get us through that praise the lord amen
[1:22:32] i mean we can punch in something we get
[1:22:34] it all down through the ages
[1:22:36] people are punched in this and punched
[1:22:38] in that you know sometimes they get off
[1:22:40] on the road don't they
[1:22:41] but god always brings us right back to
[1:22:44] the road amen
[1:22:45] right back to the main road amen if we
[1:22:48] never let the holy spirit just don't
[1:22:50] awaken
[1:22:51] inside of us you know make sure that
[1:22:53] he's living there make sure that we know
[1:22:55] that god
[1:22:55] is taking us and leading us and lives
[1:22:58] inside of us hallelujah
[1:23:01] and i get onto my children other day my
[1:23:04] grandson got real sick
[1:23:06] you know and and i know i hurt my
[1:23:09] daughter i guess and my son-in-law's
[1:23:11] feelings a little bit i said
[1:23:14] lord i say you know we should have had
[1:23:17] him in prayer we should have brought him
[1:23:19] up for prayer
[1:23:21] i said when he got sick and had a fever
[1:23:23] and
[1:23:24] stayed like that for a day or two and
[1:23:25] real sick i said
[1:23:28] i'll come and sit in the church you know
[1:23:30] and i'll preach my little
[1:23:32] my heart out sometimes just trying to
[1:23:34] get people see that god's real you know
[1:23:36] i said all you had to do is just bring
[1:23:38] him up and let us pray for him
[1:23:41] we'll use this little oil here and just
[1:23:43] put a little on him and
[1:23:44] just lay her hands on him i said god can
[1:23:47] do something for him
[1:23:48] right it's kind of it's too simple for
[1:23:50] people sometimes either
[1:23:52] i mean the first thing we find when we
[1:23:54] get kind of sick is
[1:23:56] man we got insurance let's run down
[1:23:58] yonder to the doctor's office
[1:24:01] you know what's that first comes through
[1:24:03] her mind
[1:24:04] and i know we'll get healed if we get
[1:24:06] healed we're gonna get healed by god
[1:24:08] anyway
[1:24:09] but you know it's just easy sometime to
[1:24:11] believe his word eh
[1:24:13] brother brown said if i pray for
[1:24:14] everybody jeffersonville and all of you
[1:24:16] die said it ain't going to
[1:24:17] change god from being a healer you know
[1:24:20] she gonna still be that healer
[1:24:23] but you know what god is still obligated
[1:24:26] to his word
[1:24:27] right he won't never let his word fail
[1:24:30] he'll stay with his word
[1:24:32] and i told him i said and finally they
[1:24:34] did bring him up for
[1:24:35] i believe that morning the next day or
[1:24:38] so they got to thinking about that
[1:24:40] and they brought him up there for prayer
[1:24:42] we prayed for the little fellow
[1:24:44] you know i believe god completely healed
[1:24:47] him he took that sickness out of his
[1:24:48] body
[1:24:49] you know god will do what he says he'll
[1:24:51] do more he said by his crops we're
[1:24:53] already healed
[1:24:55] but he has to get us to a place you know
[1:24:56] where we can believe it praise god
[1:24:59] i mean god so proved itself to me in so
[1:25:03] many ways
[1:25:03] amen to show me that he loved me and
[1:25:05] showed me that he cured for me
[1:25:07] and he's there with me you know he's on
[1:25:09] the inside he's living there
[1:25:10] but a lot of times i i'll let him go to
[1:25:12] sleep on me you know i just
[1:25:14] i forget to uh get his benefits like he
[1:25:18] said all these
[1:25:18] all everything in here is farming praise
[1:25:21] god all of his great benefits and all of
[1:25:23] his
[1:25:24] power and his glory is in here it
[1:25:27] belongs to me
[1:25:28] praise god because i'm a part of him
[1:25:29] brother right but we're going to have to
[1:25:32] learn how to use it you know taking use
[1:25:34] to don't let it become of no
[1:25:35] fact to us because if it does
[1:25:38] the devil can beat us out of just one
[1:25:41] little thing sometimes he'll just take
[1:25:42] one little he'll cause us to uh let one
[1:25:46] little thing happen i know he's done
[1:25:47] that to me
[1:25:49] you know what next thing it's easier it
[1:25:51] gets a little easier for me to give into
[1:25:53] it
[1:25:54] you say oh some things it's too hard for
[1:25:57] god you know
[1:25:58] i just can't trust him with some of my
[1:26:00] old problems you know

[1:29:17] think well god's forgot us
[1:29:19] and left us in sickness and diseases
[1:29:21] i've heard a lot of people say well i've
[1:29:23] tried to trust god and everything you
[1:29:25] know and
[1:29:26] when i get sick seem like it's no he's
[1:29:28] not there but he is there
[1:29:30] god is will you ever where are you at
[1:29:32] and whatever you're in he's there we
[1:29:34] praise god i believe as my brother told
[1:29:37] me before service said
[1:29:39] about helping somebody uh giving
[1:29:41] somebody some money or something said
[1:29:43] whatever you do with you know god's
[1:29:46] gonna
[1:29:47] if you take that money and use it misuse
[1:29:49] it it'll be
[1:29:50] you're doing it but you know because i
[1:29:52] give it to him it's god you know
[1:29:54] and to think about that you know if you
[1:29:56] if you misuse god you have to
[1:29:58] you do something wrong or get out of the
[1:30:01] will of god you know you
[1:30:02] god's there you're doing him you're
[1:30:03] taking him weed if you're a
[1:30:05] child of god right you know we shouldn't
[1:30:07] be good
[1:30:08] we shouldn't take advantage of his fang
[1:30:10] and say god
[1:30:11] i don't want to do nothing lord that you
[1:30:14] wouldn't do
[1:30:15] god don't let me do nothing of my own
[1:30:18] you know don't let me get in my own will
[1:30:20] because if we do we'll find ourselves in
[1:30:23] a kind of a
[1:30:24] bad shape sometimes we'll give you a get
[1:30:26] rebuked sometimes and
[1:30:28] you say sometimes old pastor who get up
[1:30:30] and he'll you think well boy he's
[1:30:32] he's just picking on me you know he
[1:30:34] knows too much about me
[1:30:37] but you know god lets him know it
[1:30:39] sometimes amen
[1:30:41] in the spirit that little pastor if he's
[1:30:43] ordained of god
[1:30:44] he's obligated to just uncover every
[1:30:47] little thing amen
[1:30:49] he's on he's obligated to bring our
[1:30:51] attention back to god
[1:30:53] ain't he back to the fangs of god i mean
[1:30:56] if he just let us
[1:30:57] go and just say oh you just do what you
[1:30:59] want to do and
[1:31:00] you know just get out just have a good
[1:31:02] time and
[1:31:03] i tell you brother and sister we'll
[1:31:05] forget about god sometimes
[1:31:08] you know what we'll catch ourselves on
[1:31:09] that ship and i was thinking about this
[1:31:11] other night i said oh peter when the
[1:31:13] lord jesus when he
[1:31:14] come back storm that time and it's after
[1:31:17] that ship and
[1:31:18] old peter they got to look and disciples
[1:31:20] got to looking around they saw something
[1:31:22] walking on the water i said man this is
[1:31:25] a
[1:31:26] you know a lot of people don't believe
[1:31:28] in ghosts i don't guess but they said
[1:31:29] this is a ghost in here
[1:31:32] and old peter got to a place he finally
[1:31:34] got enough boneless in him he said well
[1:31:36] master if this
[1:31:37] is you just let me just let me come out
[1:31:39] there and
[1:31:40] you know god will let you walk on the
[1:31:42] water right but you better have faith
[1:31:44] when you step out of that shield
[1:31:47] i believe that's what god's been trying
[1:31:49] to get us to do is that
[1:31:50] we've rode this old ship you know and
[1:31:52] it's about time for us to step out on
[1:31:54] the water
[1:31:55] i mean we've gotten used to riding the
[1:31:57] ship too much you know
[1:31:59] we're living in a time when a storm is a
[1:32:01] raging brothers sister
[1:32:02] we live in a time when we're living in a
[1:32:04] darkest page we've ever lived in really
[1:32:07] right now in this united states of
[1:32:09] america right when the little brides are
[1:32:11] getting ready to get in that millennium
[1:32:14] i was reading another day where brother
[1:32:15] brown i said wait back in 61 i believe
[1:32:18] what he said we should have already been
[1:32:20] in the living
[1:32:20] i said oh my have we missed it
[1:32:24] i said think about that he said you
[1:32:26] already would have been in it
[1:32:28] i said sure to god we ain't behind that
[1:32:31] far
[1:32:31] you know he was looking for it back then
[1:32:34] i'm preaching it you know
[1:32:36] trying to get people a seat it's not
[1:32:37] long off it's just getting real close
[1:32:40] but you know we're getting we're getting
[1:32:42] right close to this thing and
[1:32:44] we're coming up with a most than an hour
[1:32:47] you better believe that the devil knows
[1:32:49] about these things
[1:32:51] he knows that we're fixing to just walk
[1:32:54] in that other dimension with him praise
[1:32:56] god
[1:32:56] and or we something we're trying to get
[1:32:59] us you know
[1:33:00] work on us and our vines and our spirit
[1:33:02] and
[1:33:03] get us to a place that will you know
[1:33:05] just can't really step
[1:33:07] out on him like we need to but god is
[1:33:09] gonna
[1:33:10] we're gonna have to do it you know it's
[1:33:11] like he told peter he said peter
[1:33:13] just come on out and meet me just step
[1:33:16] out
[1:33:17] but as you know when he stepped out hey
[1:33:20] what did he do
[1:33:21] he started going down didn't he you know
[1:33:24] what that's what
[1:33:25] we got to see here because if we're not
[1:33:27] really careful
[1:33:29] we're living in a time that gods are
[1:33:30] telling us to step out into the deep you
[1:33:32] know to get in him
[1:33:34] get our minds anchored in him get
[1:33:35] herself in but if we ain't really got
[1:33:38] our minds anchored in there then
[1:33:39] there'll be all kinds of little things
[1:33:40] that devlin used to
[1:33:42] how to get us off on something else you
[1:33:44] know you get us to
[1:33:45] get the different ideals and different
[1:33:47] opinions and
[1:33:49] i didn't know there was so many got in
[1:33:51] the message to here
[1:33:52] a few about a year or two ago and got
[1:33:56] the list of different things
[1:33:58] i never seen lots of things come up my
[1:34:00] life i said oh my what's
[1:34:02] going on here you know what i thought we
[1:34:04] just need to get in this basically to
[1:34:06] simply believe what he said you know and
[1:34:08] staying with what the prophet of god
[1:34:10] said i mean keep that
[1:34:12] love and keep that in unity you know but
[1:34:14] i know there's
[1:34:15] little things in here i guess people's
[1:34:17] mist i guess a lot of the great
[1:34:18] preachers we got today in the message is
[1:34:20] probably
[1:34:21] maybe has i know maybe some of them
[1:34:24] knows it all
[1:34:25] but still there may be a few little
[1:34:26] things in here that they don't know you
[1:34:28] know i haven't got
[1:34:29] been revealed to them right yet but
[1:34:32] we're searching you know we're digging
[1:34:33] we're waiting for god to give us the
[1:34:35] final
[1:34:37] a test thing we praise the lord probably
[1:34:39] we're coming to the final test
[1:34:42] brother and sister that's why the
[1:34:43] prophet of god said i ain't gonna be
[1:34:44] many make it he said
[1:34:46] why because we we're coming through the
[1:34:48] trials of these things and tested
[1:34:51] i mean it's just like the natural types
[1:34:53] of spiritual and like
[1:34:55] my daughter back here i she's been going
[1:34:58] to nurses
[1:34:59] you know to be a nurse and all the
[1:35:02] spends hours and days and nights
[1:35:04] are kind of understanding the books and
[1:35:07] things she has to go through
[1:35:10] you know but when she comes to that
[1:35:12] final test of it
[1:35:14] and she don't it don't she ain't got to
[1:35:17] what it takes to pass it she's gonna she
[1:35:19] just can't go in
[1:35:22] you know that's the way god's doing us
[1:35:24] he's putting us through the final test
[1:35:26] of this message i believe
[1:35:28] i believe we've come a long ways but i
[1:35:30] still believe
[1:35:31] we've got a little ways to go yet ain't
[1:35:33] we praise god
[1:35:34] hallelujah so we might be able to walk
[1:35:37] on the water but if we ain't really
[1:35:39] careful we'll start sinking you know
[1:35:41] brother it's a serious thing this
[1:35:43] this is desperation that god you know
[1:35:46] prophet of god said we weren't going to
[1:35:47] make it till desperation said it
[1:35:50] you say well how can we get desperate
[1:35:52] listen i believe it's time to get
[1:35:54] desperate don't you
[1:35:55] i believe it's time to search a
[1:35:56] scripture search a word search a message
[1:35:59] thank god
[1:36:00] get back and see if there's any little
[1:36:02] hens left off anywhere see if there's
[1:36:04] any things that's hindered us anything
[1:36:06] that stops us from really
[1:36:07] believing what he said
[1:36:10] because they gonna take much to to get
[1:36:13] us to thinking off on different lines
[1:36:15] and different ideals and things
[1:36:17] and i i tell you what i love my precious
[1:36:21] brothers i got a lot of them that i know
[1:36:23] and
[1:36:24] you know i know that they kind of
[1:36:27] leaning off the different little ideals
[1:36:29] and things and
[1:36:30] i just wonder i say lord is this really
[1:36:32] the way we need to go is this what we
[1:36:34] need to believe
[1:36:36] you know i if you get to listen to some
[1:36:38] of them
[1:36:39] that's why i guess we need to stay with
[1:36:40] their pastor though thanks god
[1:36:43] you know brother brown said your pastor
[1:36:44] will take you through it
[1:36:46] man if you put confidence in him i
[1:36:48] believe y'all got to greet when it's
[1:36:50] pure praise
[1:36:51] i believe you got one that wants to make
[1:36:53] it amen
[1:36:55] brother dale i've listened to him and i
[1:36:57] told him the other day i said brother
[1:36:59] when i if i go up there you got to

[1:37:03] there and be with us an attitude praise
[1:37:05] the lord

[1:37:10] i told him i was gonna really call him
[1:37:12] when he gets back and
[1:37:13] get him set up because i need we need
[1:37:15] that teaching praise god
[1:37:17] my little body needs more understanding
[1:37:20] that we all need i know i need it
[1:37:22] and i know our little church needs it
[1:37:24] thank god and i believe god can give us
[1:37:27] a little hearing a little there he'll
[1:37:29] help us to mature and we'll be more get
[1:37:31] more like god we begin to look like him
[1:37:33] amen

[1:37:36] lord and he's
[1:37:38] working on us amen my little boy joshua

[1:37:43] working on me
[1:37:44] you know what the whole song is all
[1:37:46] about don't know what he knows but he's
[1:37:47] singing about every service
[1:37:49] and you know what i thought boy that
[1:37:51] sounds good amen
[1:37:53] god was working on me hallelujah and he
[1:37:56] didn't quit working on me he still mowed
[1:37:58] me up we gotta get that old father's
[1:37:59] house i tell you

[1:38:03] god's got to beat on us
[1:38:05] and you know and bring us through a real
[1:38:08] testing time to get us molded in him
[1:38:10] don't
[1:38:11] right hallelujah you got to be just like
[1:38:13] him and i was
[1:38:14] telling it or not i said when it was
[1:38:16] michelangelo he made that
[1:38:18] statue of moses praise god and he spent
[1:38:21] a lot of time working on that thing did
[1:38:24] i mean he had to get such a revelation
[1:38:27] such a mind did him
[1:38:29] to build that thing he got so perfect
[1:38:31] you know he
[1:38:32] finally got in such a condition he's
[1:38:34] finally struck and said speak did he
[1:38:37] thought that hang on to talk you know
[1:38:39] what's words got to get
[1:38:41] some means so much to us it's got to get
[1:38:43] to a place that we can hear god
[1:38:44] talking amen amen the word killeth but
[1:38:48] this spirit will give life you know
[1:38:49] there's a god that hears us when we get
[1:38:51] to
[1:38:51] uh getting our hearts down to this word
[1:38:53] getting our lives applied to it
[1:38:55] getting your whole being applied to it
[1:38:57] you can hear him talking to you
[1:38:59] you think god still can't talk to us he
[1:39:02] can do it okay right
[1:39:03] sometimes he has to use old pastors and
[1:39:05] he's a sunday school teacher
[1:39:06] i'd have to use a deacon or something
[1:39:08] but i'll tell you what he's still
[1:39:10] talking to us amen thank god he'll come
[1:39:13] right to us and
[1:39:14] you say lord that's what i needed you
[1:39:16] know
[1:39:17] it's hard sometimes to get scalded to
[1:39:20] scold it a little bit
[1:39:21] but i tell you what when you do and you
[1:39:24] can overcome and take it
[1:39:26] he'll do you good praise god that's
[1:39:28] right i mean it helps you something to
[1:39:30] get some time just get rebuked
[1:39:32] amen and if you old pastor sometimes he
[1:39:34] gets something he'll
[1:39:36] you know just begin to preach fangs and
[1:39:37] it he'll say well hey i don't need that
[1:39:39] i don't think but if you get the search
[1:39:41] in your mind real good your soul you
[1:39:43] might need it
[1:39:44] i mean it might be something that you
[1:39:46] need and he's trying to god it's trying
[1:39:48] to use that old pastor he wonder why
[1:39:50] he's not preaching something like that
[1:39:51] he wonders why he's a set in his face
[1:39:54] but some how another day somebody maybe
[1:39:56] needs it
[1:39:57] all of us might not need it but there
[1:39:59] might be one that does need
[1:40:02] just like you sometimes you preach a
[1:40:04] little message you see people that needs
[1:40:06] healing and needs they need something
[1:40:08] from god maybe need the holy ghost or
[1:40:10] need of lessons from god or
[1:40:12] they need to have more understanding and
[1:40:14] you try to
[1:40:15] preach the things that god would put on
[1:40:17] your heart to that
[1:40:19] need you see and god sees that need he
[1:40:22] needs he might be the least one in the
[1:40:24] church it might be somebody that's not
[1:40:25] mature to
[1:40:26] or somebody that's not really been
[1:40:29] birthed yet or something but god will
[1:40:30] let's the preacher he led to ministry
[1:40:33] they'll begin to preach these things
[1:40:35] till god gets us right to it morning
[1:40:37] then you'll know it's him talking to you
[1:40:39] praise the lord
[1:40:41] that's the way it does to me and i it's
[1:40:43] like i what i said with i'm precious
[1:40:45] brothers
[1:40:46] that was in a message it was with
[1:40:48] brother branham and
[1:40:50] listen to him brother uh parmer i guess
[1:40:52] a lot of you know him
[1:40:54] that's what brother brown brother jack
[1:40:55] farmer he come and spent a whole weekend
[1:40:58] one time we fished and count and
[1:41:01] boy they sat around the little count for
[1:41:04] us and
[1:41:05] he knowed i didn't know much about
[1:41:07] nothing you know i was i was
[1:41:09] playing things in the message
[1:41:12] and he'd tell me all these things that
[1:41:14] god had showed him and
[1:41:16] brought him through and it opened up his
[1:41:18] understanding to
[1:41:19] you know it's just a blessing to him i
[1:41:21] mean i enjoyed it so much i've been with
[1:41:23] him a whole week
[1:41:25] and hearing him expound on some things
[1:41:27] and that god
[1:41:28] talked to him and brought him through
[1:41:30] you know and it really was a help to me
[1:41:33] did i run into that brother ned iverson
[1:41:35] boy he he was a real
[1:41:37] bible scholar and i thought man this
[1:41:40] fellow here
[1:41:41] he just got too much knowledge i said
[1:41:44] with this little
[1:41:45] jewish brother come through one time and
[1:41:48] and i
[1:41:48] i know brother brother eddie's done gone
[1:41:50] to be the lord so i can't
[1:41:52] i can't hurt him more now you know
[1:41:55] you can't do him much damage now uh
[1:41:59] but i'll tell you what just a little
[1:42:01] brother coming up this little jewish
[1:42:02] brother he said brother dad iverson
[1:42:04] he said what you need to do is just cut
[1:42:06] your head off and throw it in that
[1:42:07] garbage can
[1:42:09] oh i thought boy that's something you
[1:42:11] know
[1:42:12] i said i didn't understand what he was
[1:42:14] talking about he said brother
[1:42:16] collins he got me off this little jewish
[1:42:18] place that brother that man's just got
[1:42:20] too much knowledge
[1:42:24] he said he just got too much knowledge i
[1:42:26] guess that little brother need to do
[1:42:27] some growing too you know
[1:42:28] amen i thought about it i said oh my i'd
[1:42:30] love to know what that brother ned knows
[1:42:32] because he really knows about the
[1:42:34] message you know he could take you from
[1:42:36] one
[1:42:36] book to nothing and quote hearing
[1:42:38] protern
[1:42:40] just line you right up you know he just
[1:42:41] about know how you live
[1:42:43] i said how can you do that but you know
[1:42:46] that's the way god does he's a getting
[1:42:47] us in a statue or something maybe god's
[1:42:49] placeness is that little lively stones
[1:42:52] you know one up on one and just getting
[1:42:54] his little temple made
[1:42:55] and i thought boy if i'm one of them
[1:42:57] stones i need to get my place you know
[1:43:00] thank god i i need to be placed and
[1:43:02] that's what god was doing he's a
[1:43:03] placeless in that
[1:43:04] part of the body you know wherever we're
[1:43:07] at just like
[1:43:08] you can't say to your little toe you
[1:43:10] don't need it do you i mean
[1:43:12] your whole body's got to be working
[1:43:14] together
[1:43:16] and i it's just like if you see somebody
[1:43:17] that's struggling somebody maybe don't
[1:43:19] know as much as something maybe
[1:43:21] he's not obligated to carry all that
[1:43:24] load you know somebody's got to get a
[1:43:25] little higher to help a safety right
[1:43:28] i mean if somebody don't learn how to
[1:43:30] use something and work with it then
[1:43:32] we'll all i certainly don't want to be
[1:43:34] eating it to you
[1:43:35] concerning the leadership of god i want
[1:43:38] to find it and see what the prophet of
[1:43:40] god has said to me to walk in that way
[1:43:42] and living that way
[1:43:43] talking that way you know i got ashamed
[1:43:47] to talk about people i used to be pretty
[1:43:49] bad to criticize people
[1:43:51] but i hear the old brothers say one time
[1:43:53] talking about the
[1:43:56] uh how it sounds and took that jawbone
[1:43:59] that i asked and killed all them
[1:44:02] philistines and
[1:44:03] people and i thought man then he come
[1:44:05] out and said he said you know what he
[1:44:07] said we killed more than he does
[1:44:09] he said us it's just individuals kills
[1:44:11] more than sampson
[1:44:12] i said oh my what's he saying yeah he
[1:44:15] said these jaw bones here kills more
[1:44:17] people than sex
[1:44:20] i said oh my god i'm gonna quit talking
[1:44:22] about people
[1:44:24] lord i sure ain't gonna be guilty back
[1:44:26] tomorrow
[1:44:27] i try to quit that you know because it's
[1:44:30] that thing if you catch yourself
[1:44:32] sometimes and we'll you know you kill
[1:44:34] people by just talking about
[1:44:35] something right man you don't have to
[1:44:38] shoot them or knock them ahead or beat
[1:44:40] them to death
[1:44:40] but just simply talking about them you
[1:44:42] can kill your brothers and sisters
[1:44:45] so that learned me a little bit on that
[1:44:46] brother i got a little wisdom on that i
[1:44:48] said oh god i ain't gonna
[1:44:50] be guilty of that no more if i can
[1:44:51] happen somebody starts talking about
[1:44:53] somebody now i try to
[1:44:55] walk away or just close myself up no
[1:44:57] because i want to stop i ain't going to
[1:44:59] kill anymore
[1:45:01] probably killed a lot of them but i've
[1:45:02] stopped but here this little scripture
[1:45:05] meant so much to me i said oh god i said
[1:45:08] the other night when i was a prayer and
[1:45:10] reading this and i said lord there's
[1:45:12] something in here that i need
[1:45:14] about that eyesight i said god if i can
[1:45:17] just anoint my eyes with it
[1:45:19] lord the only way you can do it really
[1:45:21] to what your eyes will just
[1:45:23] to hear what that prophet is saying
[1:45:27] i mean if you want to get some this
[1:45:28] eyesight on listen to what he says
[1:45:31] believe it and i'll tell you what he'll
[1:45:33] drop down through your whole body
[1:45:36] he'll make you dress right it'll make
[1:45:38] you wear your hair right it'll make you
[1:45:40] tall proud it'll make you live right
[1:45:43] it'll make you do what you're supposed
[1:45:44] to and that's what god's
[1:45:46] trying to get us in a position to do it
[1:45:48] to be obedient to him man
[1:45:50] amen if god can ever get us in line with
[1:45:53] him
[1:45:53] uh but i was going back through this and
[1:45:56] my spirit tonight
[1:45:58] god was taking me back to paul and to
[1:46:00] moses and a lot of these fellows
[1:46:02] and how that they had to be brought down
[1:46:05] to a place you know that they could
[1:46:07] they had to see god you know they had to
[1:46:09] know israel
[1:46:10] hallelujah i don't want to be out there
[1:46:13] if i don't know it's real just like a
[1:46:16] lot of the soldiers and army you know
[1:46:18] they get out there
[1:46:20] they don't go through that train and
[1:46:22] teaching and listening and
[1:46:24] being obedient to how to conduct
[1:46:26] ourselves and listen
[1:46:28] you know what they don't know what to do
[1:46:30] when they get involved
[1:46:32] and that's the way god's letting us
[1:46:33] we're fighting the greatest battle
[1:46:35] that's ever fall
[1:46:36] right now i mean we go we're living in
[1:46:39] this time when these flames are
[1:46:40] repeating again you know the prophet of
[1:46:41] god said all these things are repeat
[1:46:43] again
[1:46:44] we're living in the sodom condition like
[1:46:46] it was back in the days of sodom
[1:46:48] we live it when god is letting the
[1:46:50] promised son come forth amen he's
[1:46:52] he's letting it be manifested in our
[1:46:54] hearts but we're living in this very
[1:46:56] hour when these things are taking place
[1:46:58] i mean it's god's let it roll around you
[1:47:00] know to the time that we're living in
[1:47:03] and it will if we ever been a time
[1:47:04] listed or governor
[1:47:07] news you know it's you can't find much
[1:47:09] fitting to listen to they can but bad
[1:47:10] news on their
[1:47:11] every bit of use you listen to is about
[1:47:13] it bad except the good news
[1:47:16] and these things are getting around our
[1:47:18] nations is gone
[1:47:20] the leadership of our nation's gone
[1:47:22] what's the happening
[1:47:24] people's killing and murder and stealing
[1:47:27] in augusta georgie you just turn on the
[1:47:29] radio down there and it's just become
[1:47:31] horrible it's just to
[1:47:32] become a place of death in a night that
[1:47:35] passes what somebody's been killed
[1:47:37] they pass the road and shoot people
[1:47:39] standing on the streets not even without
[1:47:41] any cause it's to shoot people
[1:47:43] we're living in a time that people is
[1:47:45] going totally insane they're young
[1:47:47] people
[1:47:48] i oh i think we better get a young
[1:47:51] people for god's sake we better get our
[1:47:53] minds in the lord
[1:47:54] this get ourselves anchored in because
[1:47:57] uh it's time we're living in when this
[1:48:00] bangs are manifest and it's coming right
[1:48:02] on the scene and they only the young
[1:48:04] people it's the older people i mean they
[1:48:06] got to a place
[1:48:08] we just don't know what is the real
[1:48:09] leadership at and what we think well
[1:48:11] where is it at but god's in here he's
[1:48:14] inside there so you got the holy ghost
[1:48:16] in if you've got that
[1:48:17] presence of god in you brother and
[1:48:19] sister all you have to do is talk to
[1:48:23] i found out one way to get close to god
[1:48:25] that's to pray and read your bible
[1:48:28] i don't know what a way to tell you i
[1:48:29] mean you could pass yourself to death
[1:48:31] and still be lost without god
[1:48:33] amen unless you're getting yourself out
[1:48:35] of the way
[1:48:36] i found out that's what i need to do i
[1:48:38] used to fast to try to get god to come
[1:48:40] down on the scene
[1:48:41] to be in the service but i found out i
[1:48:44] was doing the wrong thing
[1:48:46] lord i need to fast to get myself out of
[1:48:48] the way
[1:48:49] god if i just get my old self killed and
[1:48:51] get this old gene collins
[1:48:53] get him plumb lost you know lord to let
[1:48:56] your mind and your spirit take control
[1:48:58] in this old vessel here god
[1:49:01] then i'll make it that's the only way
[1:49:02] i'll make it that's all the way i can
[1:49:04] help anybody
[1:49:06] because i was used to praying like a
[1:49:09] brother said you're
[1:49:10] sinners you know anybody can be healed
[1:49:13] i've seen people that wasn't even living
[1:49:15] right get healed by miracles
[1:49:18] i mean because it they they just
[1:49:20] believed you know they'd come out with
[1:49:22] what faith they had and
[1:49:23] god would heal them and a lot of them
[1:49:26] they just wouldn't make it fill them
[1:49:27] with a holy spirit and
[1:49:29] i've seen them receive that baptism the
[1:49:31] holy spirit on the human spirit you know
[1:49:33] and
[1:49:34] they'd prophesy and speak in tongues
[1:49:36] give out messages
[1:49:37] but they just couldn't live right they
[1:49:39] just couldn't get in the place they need
[1:49:41] to be with god
[1:49:43] especially my wife we come down into
[1:49:46] custody georgie going to church with
[1:49:49] some of her people and
[1:49:52] and it kind of astonished you know
[1:49:54] spain's deceiving sometimes if god don't
[1:49:56] open up your mind and show you things
[1:49:58] before we got into the message and i
[1:50:00] never will forget how to
[1:50:02] we'd go there and some of her people
[1:50:04] would shout just shallow the church you
[1:50:06] know fall out in the spirit people ever
[1:50:08] would all
[1:50:09] and i'd see them day by day and see how
[1:50:11] they just wasn't living right
[1:50:14] i mean if i came to see the things in
[1:50:16] the scriptures that they need to obey
[1:50:18] and do what god wanted them to do and
[1:50:20] line up with the word of god but they
[1:50:22] had the anointing on them you know and
[1:50:23] they had that spirit of working in their
[1:50:25] life but they couldn't
[1:50:26] they just couldn't walk in the light of
[1:50:28] christ couldn't live like they need to
[1:50:31] i said lord there's something you're
[1:50:33] lacking somewhere
[1:50:34] and they certainly was you know you
[1:50:36] couldn't but my wife
[1:50:38] thank god gotta got a hold of her and
[1:50:40] let her see that
[1:50:42] you know she had to live his words not
[1:50:44] go but feelings you go by
[1:50:46] what obedience to god you know your
[1:50:49] feelings might try to take you some
[1:50:50] other way
[1:50:52] i mean if you got your mind in here
[1:50:54] might be trying to take you a lot of
[1:50:55] ways but
[1:50:57] in your feelings but yet the word god
[1:50:59] let it be the truth you know he said let
[1:51:00] every man be alive with my word be the
[1:51:02] truth
[1:51:04] so if that one so if that would be the
[1:51:05] soul then we got our builder life up on
[1:51:08] his word they
[1:51:09] praise god it might not satisfy our
[1:51:11] feelings all the time
[1:51:12] might not satisfy once all time but i'd
[1:51:15] better be in his word praise god and
[1:51:17] have my own wants and have my own
[1:51:19] feelings because i'll tell you
[1:51:22] we've satisfied our feelings we might do
[1:51:24] everything we can to
[1:51:25] just get all we can get you know and be
[1:51:27] blessed out here in the natural manner
[1:51:29] and yet god's wanting to take us the way
[1:51:31] that we need to go
[1:51:32] some other way through the word you know
[1:51:35] and it might get a little hard you know
[1:51:37] why sometimes we have some hard times
[1:51:39] and
[1:51:40] good times but god brings us through all
[1:51:42] of it praise the lord
[1:51:44] but i want to get back to this year now
[1:51:45] i'm going to stop here
[1:51:47] god is trying to get her mind back to
[1:51:50] his word back to his presence amen
[1:51:53] and i found the best way to do it is to
[1:51:55] get this old-fashioned bible
[1:51:57] word and just say lord here i am god
[1:52:01] lord if you'll take me in moment use me
[1:52:04] and let me just be in your leadership
[1:52:06] god i'll
[1:52:07] i just like the prophet of god he
[1:52:10] started off as that young fellow
[1:52:11] i used to get that life story out and i
[1:52:13] read it listen to it
[1:52:16] i say oh man it's just a blessing to
[1:52:19] hear what he was going through but a lot
[1:52:20] of times he had to
[1:52:22] he god rebuked it and god chased him and
[1:52:26] you know a lot of his wants he didn't
[1:52:28] get him did
[1:52:29] i mean he had to take him and take him
[1:52:31] around the hard way sometime
[1:52:33] and he lived as poor he's the poorest
[1:52:35] person i guess it was in kentucky
[1:52:38] at one time he didn't have nothing you
[1:52:40] don't
[1:52:41] but after he got in the mind of god he
[1:52:43] didn't need want for nothing i mean
[1:52:45] everything that he needed you know it
[1:52:48] was our farm praise god
[1:52:50] and it was hard because he sure didn't
[1:52:53] want to burden the people for nothing he
[1:52:54] didn't want nobody to feel like that
[1:52:56] they
[1:52:56] need to be burdened for him even out of
[1:52:58] his as many
[1:53:00] right when he's out in on the fields and
[1:53:02] going and
[1:53:03] and he he didn't want to impress some
[1:53:06] people he said god if you
[1:53:07] call me you'll meet the need you know
[1:53:09] you'll see that this
[1:53:10] needs me it did and you know what he
[1:53:13] said i'll get a job if
[1:53:14] god i'll go back to work if you don't
[1:53:16] meet the needs i
[1:53:17] they want him to come overseas in
[1:53:19] different places and
[1:53:20] him a prayer and kind of get in the mind
[1:53:22] of god get in the leadership of god and
[1:53:25] you know he didn't have finances to go
[1:53:27] he just didn't have help to go
[1:53:29] so he'd start praying he said lord i'll
[1:53:31] just get me a job and go to work
[1:53:33] and if you want me to go when i get
[1:53:34] enough money then
[1:53:36] i might be able to go but see that
[1:53:38] wasn't god's plan was it
[1:53:40] god knows how he could get him in his
[1:53:42] will he didn't meet them needs did
[1:53:45] he'd make sure if he sent him he'd be
[1:53:47] there to
[1:53:48] meet the need for him praise the lord
[1:53:50] and he saw that and that prophet of god
[1:53:52] as he growed up and began to
[1:53:54] see these things how god was leading him
[1:53:56] and material
[1:53:58] and getting him ready for this journey
[1:54:00] praise the lord it become a blessing to
[1:54:03] him
[1:54:04] and he just got richer and richer on the
[1:54:06] inside of it praise god
[1:54:07] he said if i need a million dollars next
[1:54:10] week god will give it to me
[1:54:13] boy i'll tell you when you get that
[1:54:14] close to god and get to a place you know
[1:54:16] there's no doubt in you
[1:54:17] there's nothing can keep you from
[1:54:19] walking in faith and living in faith
[1:54:22] and staying in the faith of god then
[1:54:23] you've got to bless them in your life
[1:54:26] and i believe that's what he's trying to
[1:54:27] do teach individual praise the lord
[1:54:29] i believe he's picking us up a little
[1:54:31] bit at a time and we'll begin to see
[1:54:33] where he said you know and it's hard
[1:54:37] sometime to
[1:54:38] go through these trials and go through
[1:54:39] the testis and go through the pressures
[1:54:41] of them
[1:54:42] but sometimes god let you do that to see
[1:54:44] if you're gonna still love him don't you
[1:54:47] i mean if he just stayed on the ship all
[1:54:49] time and got everything you needed
[1:54:52] i mean it's everything learned every
[1:54:53] little things maybe we'd forget about
[1:54:55] god but forget about
[1:54:56] praying and forget about how others is
[1:54:59] having to go through struggles and
[1:55:00] things sometimes
[1:55:02] but we have to be touched with these
[1:55:03] things you know god
[1:55:05] he'd come as low as anybody could he
[1:55:07] humbled himself and come down here left
[1:55:09] his riches and glory
[1:55:11] left everything he had to come down here
[1:55:13] to walk in their footprints did he
[1:55:15] had to take this little journey parson
[1:55:18] he is tested by all these things and
[1:55:20] whatever trial and error persecution
[1:55:23] ever sin every disease
[1:55:25] god had to go through the test of his
[1:55:27] faith he overcome that that we could
[1:55:29] overcome
[1:55:30] so today if we realize that everything
[1:55:33] that we go through and every little test
[1:55:34] we go through god's already
[1:55:36] paid for it he's already given us sprint
[1:55:38] to overcome any praise the lord he's
[1:55:40] made us strong enough to overcome these
[1:55:42] things
[1:55:43] brother and sister will become real to
[1:55:45] us after fall amen
[1:55:47] and i i just thank god for his grace
[1:55:49] tonight do you love him
[1:55:50] amen i'm going to stop prayer but listen
[1:55:53] let me read that one little
[1:55:54] license verse and then i'll stop amen
[1:55:58] revelations 3 and 18 he said
[1:56:02] here in 21 he said to him that overcome
[1:56:04] will i
[1:56:05] grant to set with me and my throne
[1:56:08] even as i also overcame
[1:56:11] and i sat down with my father
[1:56:14] in his promise he to have a year let him

[1:56:18] what the spirit set up under the
[1:56:21] churches
