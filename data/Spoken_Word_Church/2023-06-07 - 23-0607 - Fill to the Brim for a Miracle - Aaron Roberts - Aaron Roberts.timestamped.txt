[11:47] always there amen well God bless you
[11:50] let's stand
[11:51] this evening and uh
[11:54] look into the scripture John chapter 2
[11:57] and the beginning of verse 1.
[12:00] and uh
[12:03] I was trying to think of a song that
[12:06] uh actually went along with what I was
[12:09] what I want to speak about tonight and
[12:12] uh that's the only song that the first
[12:14] song actually really come to my mind and
[12:16] had that in it but John Chapter 2
[12:18] beginning at verse one and uh it's about
[12:21] uh
[12:22] turning the water into wine
[12:25] and I I titled this failed to filled to
[12:30] the brim for a miracle
[12:34] and uh I
[12:37] I heard something the other day just
[12:38] caught my attention
[12:40] and
[12:42] what struck me I was listening to
[12:44] somebody do you know that the
[12:47] water to wine is probably one of the
[12:50] most common Miracles that's talked about
[12:52] that Jesus performed
[12:54] people that are not Christians
[12:57] people that are or don't know read the
[13:00] Bible they don't go to church
[13:02] but people will tell you that Jesus
[13:04] turned water to wine
[13:05] they know about water to wine
[13:09] but what was interesting was when you
[13:12] look at that everybody's like well Jesus
[13:14] turned the water to wine well you know
[13:15] what something had to take place
[13:18] something had to take place so that's
[13:21] what I want to look at tonight was
[13:23] that's what's what caught my attention
[13:25] when I was hearing that you know because
[13:26] everybody thinks well you know just
[13:28] Jesus done this and Jesus done that but
[13:30] you know what it took somebody had to do
[13:32] something
[13:34] there had to be an Act of Faith
[13:37] for God to perform
[13:40] and if we if we see that you know it
[13:42] says well God just does yeah but lots of
[13:44] times what holds God from doing things
[13:46] is we don't do it what we're supposed to
[13:49] do amen
[13:50] amen
[13:52] so let's just all bow our heads this
[13:54] evening and
[13:55] remember all the ones that are

[16:02] Christ we pray amen
[16:04] amen John chapter 2
[16:06] beginning at verse 1.
[16:08] and it says
[16:10] and the third day there was a marriage
[16:12] in Cana of Galilee and the mother of
[16:15] Jesus was there and both Jesus was
[16:17] called and it is disciples to the
[16:19] marriage and when they wanted
[16:22] wine
[16:24] the mother of Jesus saith unto him they
[16:27] have no wine Jesus saith unto her woman
[16:30] what have I to do with thee my an hour
[16:33] is not yet come
[16:35] his mother saith unto the servants
[16:37] whatsoever he saith do unto you do it
[16:42] and there were set there six water pots
[16:45] of stone after the manner of the
[16:46] purification purifying of the Jews
[16:48] containing two or three Firkins a piece
[16:51] Jesus saith unto them fill the water
[16:53] pots with water and they were filled
[16:55] filled them up to the brim and he saith
[16:58] unto them draw out now and bear unto the
[17:01] governor of the feast
[17:04] and they bear it and when when the ruler
[17:06] of the feast had tasted the water that
[17:09] was made wine and knew not once it was
[17:11] but the servants which drew the water
[17:14] knew the governor of the feast called
[17:16] the bridegroom
[17:18] and saith unto him every man at the
[17:20] beginning doth set forth good wine and
[17:23] when men have well drunk then that which
[17:25] is worse but thou has kept the good wine
[17:28] until now
[17:31] this beginning of miracles did Jesus and
[17:34] Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his
[17:37] glory and his disciples believed on him
[17:39] amen God bless you you may have your
[17:41] seats this evening God bless the reading
[17:43] of the word
[17:45] and
[17:47] so
[17:50] that was
[17:51] as I was saying
[17:53] I was
[17:55] I I was listening to a man and he was
[17:59] talking about
[18:01] you know this being the one of the most
[18:03] commonly known Miracles even people that
[18:05] aren't Christians they know about this
[18:07] uh
[18:09] this miracle that took place
[18:11] but you know lots of times
[18:14] we don't under you know we don't
[18:16] understand we don't look at the scope a
[18:18] lot of people don't look at the scope of
[18:20] what it takes for for a miracle
[18:23] and you know
[18:24] um
[18:25] brother Branham was speaking in a
[18:27] message and uh at a at kadish Barney and
[18:31] brother random is talking about miracles
[18:32] and you know he was talking about you
[18:34] know not for us to ask for miracles
[18:37] he said but you know we look to God we
[18:40] put our faith in God because God he said
[18:43] signs follow the Believers
[18:45] he said if we if we have our trust in
[18:47] God in his word then the Miracles will
[18:50] take place he said God performs miracles
[18:53] but the thing is is he said he said
[18:56] brother I said the Bible says a week a
[18:58] week a week an adulterous generation
[19:01] seeks after miracles
[19:03] he said we don't seek after Miracles but
[19:05] he said but God performs miracles
[19:09] he said right at the same time he said
[19:11] that he was performing miracles
[19:14] he said I don't he said I don't believe
[19:15] in evidences he said I believe in the
[19:18] evidence that we're saved we took God at
[19:20] his word so that's the main thing he's
[19:22] taken God at his word but you know God
[19:25] does Miracles he's a miracle-working God
[19:27] but the main thing is is not seeking
[19:29] after a sign and not seeking after a
[19:32] miracle but putting our trust in God
[19:34] because whatever God wants to do God is
[19:36] Sovereign in what he does and you know
[19:38] but the thing is is God wants us to have
[19:40] TR our trust in him to have confidence
[19:43] in him and you know whatever he wants to
[19:45] do then praise God I know one thing
[19:47] whatever God does he don't make a
[19:50] mistake he's never he's never wrong you
[19:53] know because I I love what you know when
[19:55] when they were speaking to Abraham
[19:58] Lincoln during the Civil War and you
[20:00] know they were asking him said you know
[20:02] who's right the the union or the or the
[20:04] Confederates and you know you know is
[20:06] the Lord on our side and he's like he
[20:08] said it's not he said it's not whether
[20:11] God is on their side or God is on our
[20:13] side he said my question is and my goal
[20:16] is to make sure I'm on the Lord's Side
[20:18] he said because the Lord's always right
[20:21] and many times we try to get it where we
[20:23] try to get God on our side and the
[20:25] Really the main focus is we need to be
[20:27] on God's side we need to have Lord the
[20:30] Lord's plan and his will that's what we
[20:33] need to look for not trying to mold
[20:35] everything to us but we need to be
[20:37] molded unto his plan whatever he want
[20:40] his will his way that's what we want
[20:43] and so when we we seek for these things
[20:45] see we are seeking not Miracles but we
[20:48] are seeking the word we are seeking
[20:50] God's word and you know one of the
[20:52] things that brother I was talking about
[20:53] was when you when you see you know the
[20:55] greatest Miracle that's taking place you
[20:58] know we we don't realize sometimes when
[21:00] we look for a miracle to take place but
[21:03] really the greatest Miracle that's ever
[21:04] taken place is when you come from a
[21:07] sinner that is cut off alienated from
[21:10] the life of God when you're when you're
[21:12] hopeless and helpless and when the
[21:14] creator of all Heaven and Earth comes
[21:17] down when he comes the sins to you and
[21:20] makes himself known to you and he takes
[21:23] up residence in you that's the greatest
[21:24] miracle and anytime we say well we're
[21:27] looking for a miracle we're looking for
[21:28] you don't realize but you are a walking
[21:30] Miracle the miracle has already taken
[21:33] place he's standing in your midst as the
[21:35] miracle the problem you are a miracle
[21:37] and you're and he is what he has done is
[21:40] this is a masterpiece and many times we
[21:43] don't we don't see that we don't
[21:45] consider that but we are a miracle and
[21:48] we are a masterpiece of God's grace of
[21:50] his of his power and in the world today
[21:54] you know people look at and they they
[21:56] look at the world and they see all these
[21:57] great Majestic things and you know they
[22:00] they try to split atoms and you know
[22:01] they're trying to figure out all these
[22:02] great things and understand the
[22:04] mysteries of all these great things that
[22:06] God has created and not realizing the
[22:08] greatest one is when God said let us
[22:11] make man in our own image and our after
[22:13] our likeness and for him to have
[22:15] dominion over the Earth and that's what
[22:18] he still wants to have today because
[22:20] through the fall that was what was
[22:23] separated from man he lost that ability
[22:26] he lost that relationship he lost that
[22:28] all of that that God had designed for
[22:31] him that he had designed man to do was
[22:33] to have dominion to be an amateur God to
[22:37] fulfill the plan of God and when when
[22:40] that failed and guess what God made a
[22:42] way because he knew it was one to take
[22:43] place he created a way for God to bring
[22:46] man back into that place back into the
[22:49] same fellowship and so that's what God
[22:51] has for us today and so the thing is is
[22:54] but there's a but there is a way that we
[22:56] must come to come into that
[22:59] and so that's what God has for us
[23:02] if we can just follow what God has for
[23:05] us the plan of God what God has done for
[23:07] us and realizing it's greater and
[23:10] there's more of it
[23:15] and so brother Brandon was speaking he
[23:16] was speaking to the to his disciples
[23:20] and you know he was telling them about
[23:21] what they needed to do
[23:24] because when we see when when man was
[23:27] separated from God you know that he got
[23:29] away from the word of God
[23:31] you know Eve separated herself because
[23:34] she didn't follow the word
[23:36] she got out from behind the
[23:37] fortification that the word presented to
[23:39] her it protected her and even Adam
[23:43] knowing that that he was in the wrong
[23:45] and yet he went out with her
[23:48] why because his love for her and he knew
[23:51] what was what he'd done but you know
[23:53] what he had love for her
[23:55] and so he went out with her knowing what
[23:57] he was giving up and he went out but you
[23:59] know what that was showing a type of of
[24:01] Christ
[24:04] because you know what he descended from
[24:06] the highest uh the highest of Glory from
[24:09] Heaven to come and Condes sin to be the
[24:12] same as you are
[24:13] to be to go through the same things that
[24:16] you and I have went through to feel the
[24:18] pain and the and the loneliness and
[24:20] every other thing that we can face that
[24:22] as a human to face these things but to
[24:25] bring us back
[24:27] to bring us back into Fellowship
[24:30] and when he began to speak to the
[24:32] disciples and he began to tell them he
[24:34] you know he tells them he said now
[24:36] listen he said you go out into the world
[24:38] go you into all the world and preach the
[24:40] gospel
[24:41] he said they signed shall follow them
[24:43] that believe
[24:45] he said that was it he said get back to
[24:47] the same word it'll produce the same
[24:50] blank
[24:51] he said they followed that word and it
[24:54] zeroed in and drove attack every attack
[24:56] every promise that God made was made
[24:59] manifest
[25:00] he said he said if we'll get back to
[25:03] that same word
[25:05] it'll drive the same tax do the same
[25:08] Miracles perform the same things make
[25:11] the same light make the same creature
[25:13] raise the dead heal the sick cast out
[25:15] Devils see Visions prophecies it's the
[25:18] same gospel that drove the text then if
[25:21] if it will get back to that to the same
[25:24] thing and if somebody just like a gun
[25:27] having the having the same conditions
[25:29] and it when a gun is set right when the
[25:32] when the barrel is correct when the
[25:36] scope is set when the sites are correct
[25:38] every single time when you're holding
[25:40] that rifle the same every single time if
[25:43] you can hit the bullseye the first time
[25:45] you should hit the bullet uh every
[25:47] single time it shouldn't there should be
[25:49] combined because he was saying so if you
[25:50] if we get the he said if we can get all
[25:52] the vibrations of unbelief out of us
[25:55] God's work will still be like it was at
[25:58] the first beginning that's exactly right
[26:01] it'll zero every time it did once it'll
[26:04] do it again don't be be satisfied with a
[26:06] Creed or something stay right there
[26:08] until the word zeros
[26:12] so we have to follow the same word but
[26:14] if if we've done it one time and he laid
[26:17] out the plan for us to come back that
[26:19] all we've got to do is get in that same
[26:21] plan follow that same thing and it'll
[26:24] zero every time
[26:28] but you know
[26:30] that's what Satan's
[26:32] see that's not what Satan's playing is
[26:34] that's what is Satan's desire is is to
[26:36] hinder you to block you to stop you from
[26:39] what God has for you
[26:41] but you know the God is God is there and
[26:44] he's trying to reach out to you and
[26:46] bring you to the place that he wants you
[26:47] to come to but the problem is is you
[26:50] know we we have the pro we have the
[26:52] power it's ours we give we give Satan
[26:55] the right to say well yeah you know what
[26:57] you can just come and get in my way and
[26:59] stop me because you know what I'm not
[27:00] going to go any further because you know
[27:03] if we listen to him
[27:06] and you know it's just like you know
[27:13] brother boy you brought this up so
[27:16] but you know you I'm not I'm not going
[27:18] I'm not gonna mention any names the
[27:20] names of the guilty are omitted to
[27:23] protect them I guess
[27:24] but you know but you know you you see
[27:26] people that you know when they when just
[27:28] like you know he talks about you you get
[27:30] into a certain situation and you see
[27:32] these people
[27:34] and you know they you try to and yeah
[27:36] y'all y'all worked y'all understand but
[27:39] I mean it's so amazing how you know you
[27:41] try to work with people you try to have
[27:43] a good relationship with them you try to
[27:46] take care of things and you know it
[27:47] doesn't matter whatever you do it's
[27:50] they're going to fight you tooth and
[27:52] nail
[27:54] and you know what and you're doing
[27:55] you're doing the dead level best to help
[27:57] them
[27:58] you can take and draw a big chart out
[28:01] and explain this is what we're doing and
[28:03] this is why we're doing it and this is
[28:05] benefiting you
[28:07] it's not benefiting me
[28:11] because you know it's like you go in
[28:13] there and brother going to tell you you
[28:14] know you're working on something that's
[28:16] like listen
[28:17] we got 19 other jobs to do but we're
[28:20] going to take priority and do your job
[28:22] when it doesn't take priority but we're
[28:24] going to do this for you
[28:27] well we got other things that are more
[28:28] important
[28:29] but we're going to help you
[28:33] and then you know what they're you know
[28:34] they'll get in your way they want you
[28:37] know they'll do everything they can just
[28:39] and it's like you know what
[28:41] yeah it's like
[28:43] we just exactly it's a mistake and then
[28:45] you just said okay sorry here you go
[28:48] and you have to move on
[28:51] and it's the same and it's the same
[28:52] thing God will come and he'll speak to
[28:55] you and you'll hear you'll hear a how
[28:57] many times have you heard the prophet
[28:58] say or a minister somebody will be
[29:00] speaking and they'll be speaking to you
[29:02] and you know that the if the Lord is
[29:04] sitting on the Pew with you talking in
[29:06] your ear and he's telling you exactly
[29:08] it's thus saith the Lord and his right
[29:09] to you
[29:12] and you know and you know that the that
[29:14] the Lord is in he's he's it's right to
[29:17] you the only thing that's not been said
[29:19] from the pulpit is your name
[29:24] but you know it's to you
[29:28] and you know and sometimes everybody
[29:31] else in the church or other people in
[29:33] the church know it's for you
[29:36] but sometimes the problem is is when
[29:38] when everything is going right to you
[29:41] and then and then when you get done it's
[29:43] like well who was that for
[29:46] and not realizing the Lord's speaking to
[29:49] you
[29:50] it's thus saith the Lord It's to you
[29:53] and everything he comes right by and
[29:55] speaks to you and speaks to your
[29:57] situation exactly letter perfect to a T
[30:01] and we miss it
[30:04] how many times with brother Brandon
[30:06] standing there and he calling people out
[30:07] and he's calling some sister out in the
[30:10] in the audience and he's talking to her
[30:12] and saying the sister back there and you
[30:14] know he begins to speak and talk to her
[30:16] and tell her the situation and trying to
[30:18] tell her what kind of dress she has on
[30:20] and everything and he begins to pray to
[30:22] the Lord Lord don't let her miss it
[30:26] and in the midst and he calls her name
[30:29] and tells and then she said you know
[30:31] that's for you but you know what gee for
[30:34] some reason maybe she didn't think she
[30:36] had faith enough that for God to speak
[30:38] to her but he's standing there speaking
[30:40] and telling her this is for you
[30:43] this is for you and it's for you
[30:46] and then well I don't I don't know
[30:49] but when but when when when the devil
[30:52] has stood and hindered you over and over
[30:55] and over and over again and you know
[30:57] what I I you know what I I guess you're
[31:01] right
[31:02] Satan I guess you're right
[31:07] but you know what it's like well you
[31:09] know well you know I'm supposed to
[31:10] resist the devil but you know what
[31:12] sometimes he just gets so you know what
[31:14] and it's and it's whoever whoever we're
[31:16] close to sometimes it's our spouse
[31:18] sometimes it's our children sometimes
[31:20] it's our boss sometimes it's our mom and
[31:22] dad
[31:26] and sometimes it's born again believers
[31:32] oh no we don't want we don't well
[31:34] sometimes it is sometimes it's somebody
[31:36] and they're gonna say something to you
[31:40] and you know what they just well
[31:45] make my feelings
[31:47] I'm gonna go home
[31:49] and I'm gonna sit down
[31:51] and I'm just gonna
[31:53] let's go just quit
[31:58] well just keep talking the devil's
[31:59] language
[32:01] he wants you to do that just quit
[32:04] I'm just I'm just I'm just upset nobody
[32:06] nobody appreciates me
[32:10] well you know what
[32:11] that you know
[32:13] hey your brother I'm talking about our
[32:14] life down here is not a flowery bed of
[32:16] ease you're going to have those times
[32:19] and you know what if nobody goes if if
[32:21] the rest of your life nobody ever comes
[32:23] by and Pat you on the back it never
[32:25] tells you that you've done a great job
[32:27] and we appreciate you you know what
[32:28] that's still and not a reason to try to
[32:30] quit
[32:32] amen why because you know what if every
[32:34] gun inhales against you if every devil
[32:37] inhales against you and you got nobody
[32:40] in your corner but you know what you
[32:41] still got almighty God who's still
[32:43] behind you and he's still going to stand
[32:46] there and you know what many times he
[32:47] wants us to stand alone to see if we can
[32:50] stand on our own two feet
[32:54] sometimes you know it's just being a
[32:56] child of God is to raise up just like
[32:59] raising children you know what there's a
[33:00] time you got to get them you can't just
[33:02] carry them around all the time
[33:04] and Pat them on the rear end and just
[33:06] you know just no you can't coddle them
[33:08] you've got to set them down and say
[33:10] listen you got to start learning how to
[33:12] walk
[33:14] stand on your own two feet
[33:17] and you know what they're going to fall
[33:18] down
[33:20] hey you got to get them back up and you
[33:22] know what Sometimes the best thing to do
[33:23] is just let them sit there they'll fall
[33:26] down but you know what sometimes they'll
[33:28] get in their mind it's time to get up
[33:32] all right instead of you trying to scoop
[33:33] them up all the time sometimes you just
[33:35] let them fall down and guess what
[33:36] they'll go somewhere and they'll get on
[33:38] the wall or they'll get to the couch and
[33:39] they'll start pulling themselves up
[33:43] why because we've got to get to the
[33:45] place where it's us and God
[33:49] you know the one of the biggest problems
[33:50] that people had when when the prophet
[33:52] was here was every time they they had
[33:54] every little thing that come along is we
[33:57] got to get in touch with brother Branham
[33:59] and brother Branham standard trying to
[34:01] get people to understand you got to look
[34:02] to Christ
[34:04] it's you in Christ he said I'm not here
[34:07] trying to make myself anything he's not
[34:09] I'm pointing you to Jesus Christ
[34:12] and it's the same way we're pointing the
[34:14] people to Jesus Christ that's what God
[34:15] has come he's wanting to have a
[34:17] relationship with you to the place that
[34:19] you can do these things
[34:25] can we do this yes we can
[34:29] here's here's when when Jesus is there
[34:31] and he's and you know he's standing in
[34:33] there at the at the water
[34:35] at the at the wedding
[34:37] and you know when when his mom Mary
[34:40] comes to him and tells him there's no
[34:41] there's no wine
[34:43] we have we have no wine here and he's
[34:45] like well you know but you know she knew
[34:47] that you need to do something
[34:51] and it's the first thing that you know
[34:53] here he is you're standing there but you
[34:55] know the first thing that she done was
[34:56] she went to Jesus with her problem
[35:00] and that's the first thing you got to do
[35:01] is you got to go to Jesus with your
[35:03] problem
[35:09] they need
[35:12] and he's like you know you know
[35:16] you know what what do you have to do
[35:17] with me
[35:21] you know you know he had never he'd
[35:22] never done any Miracles but you know she
[35:24] was looking to him for a for an answer
[35:27] because and and in which she had such
[35:29] faith that she stood there and she told
[35:31] us that whatever he says for y'all to do
[35:34] just do it
[35:37] and you know they have these the big
[35:39] water pots there that they have for uh
[35:42] you know when they when they entered in
[35:43] that was for them to clean with
[35:45] and you know here they are with those
[35:47] big water pots and you've got different
[35:49] measures and you know there's many
[35:51] things that you can you can look at in
[35:53] the in the types here but you know when
[35:55] to have all these these big water pots
[35:57] and when Jesus comes in and he tells
[35:58] them he said fill those water pots
[36:03] so here they are you know they come and
[36:04] they fill the water pots full
[36:07] here though they're adding all the water
[36:11] well you know they didn't
[36:14] sit around and say well why
[36:17] why are we doing this
[36:18] they need walk you know they they're
[36:20] looking for wine not water
[36:23] well what are we doing these things for
[36:27] I was I was reading a commentary uh by
[36:31] Spurgeon and and Spurgeon was talking
[36:33] about you know it was so amazing when
[36:35] when you look at this situation you know
[36:37] God is only using what's available
[36:40] he said the pots were already there he
[36:43] said water was in abundance there was no
[36:45] shortage of water
[36:46] and so here they are that's what that's
[36:48] what was in front of them that was close
[36:50] by
[36:52] and he said just fill them up
[36:54] brother Branham said that that the wine
[36:57] the water would most likely turn to be
[36:59] turned into wine anyway so he just
[37:01] bypassed all that
[37:03] but you know he wanted them to do
[37:05] something
[37:06] and they didn't they didn't question why
[37:08] are we doing this what's the outcome
[37:11] no just just fill your water pots
[37:14] just fill them up
[37:16] just continue to fill them up and he
[37:18] said you know not just add a little bit
[37:20] more and a little bit more he said fill
[37:21] them up to the brim
[37:24] what does that mean you fill them up
[37:26] until you can't get them more in it
[37:28] the next step is overflowing
[37:32] it put all your can in there just keep
[37:34] filling them keep filling those pots
[37:38] I mean and and so you know what what is
[37:41] the what is the clay pots represents
[37:43] Humanity humans they're six parts what
[37:47] is the is the number of man
[37:49] you know there's different types that we
[37:50] can look at but you know here they are
[37:52] adding adding the water to those pots
[37:55] and you know what they keep adding water
[37:57] into it
[37:59] what is it the water of the word just
[38:01] keep putting it in just keep putting it
[38:02] in keep putting it in and he said when
[38:04] they got when they got to the place
[38:06] where they filled those water pots full
[38:08] then they could dip out
[38:10] but it was it's such a simple thing but
[38:12] you know what that's what God wants us
[38:14] to do
[38:16] that he said you know he said
[38:19] when he was speaking to the disciples
[38:21] and he was telling them he said you know
[38:23] he said these signs
[38:25] shall follow them that belief
[38:28] so if you do what I say do he said then
[38:31] the Miracles will take place but you
[38:32] just follow what I say do
[38:34] and he began to tell them to go out and
[38:36] he said listen he said in my name you'll
[38:38] cast out Devils he said they'll speak
[38:40] with new tongues
[38:42] he said he said he said you can take up
[38:45] service or drink deadly things and none
[38:47] of these things will harm you
[38:49] all of these things but he said go and
[38:52] do all these things so lay hands on the
[38:53] sick they shall recover he said he that
[38:55] believeth on me the works that I do
[38:57] shall he do also
[39:00] so if you follow all of these things
[39:01] that God has said if you'll follow these
[39:03] then they'll come to pass all you got to
[39:06] do is just believe
[39:08] and he said you know so that you didn't
[39:10] have to have any kind of special
[39:11] training he was speaking of Peter and
[39:13] John you know they didn't have to have
[39:15] an education they didn't have to have
[39:16] anything all they had to do was have
[39:18] confidence in what God Said what Jesus
[39:20] told them and they could go out and do
[39:22] it that's all it took he said you know
[39:25] they didn't have to have anything but
[39:27] you know he said they didn't have to
[39:28] have any they didn't have money because
[39:31] you know Jesus Peter stood there and
[39:33] John stood there and repent Silver and
[39:35] Gold Have I None
[39:37] but such as I have I give unto you
[39:40] that's all it took because you know what
[39:41] was given to them is what they could
[39:43] give out
[39:45] that's why they could give out he said
[39:47] in in the name of Jesus Christ why rise
[39:49] up and walk what they told the crippled
[39:51] man
[39:52] why because he had that and he had it
[39:55] because he was what it was given to him
[39:58] but you know what the thing is is it had
[39:59] to be a time that he was filled
[40:03] and you know so as as we were reading
[40:06] earlier you know the more you get full
[40:08] on the things of God you know what then
[40:10] you got to force the devil out
[40:13] you know the old saying that is you know
[40:17] you know God never turns us away empty
[40:19] unless we're full of ourselves
[40:21] you know so if we if we have the things
[40:24] that hinder us you know that's the
[40:26] things we got to get rid of but you know
[40:27] what it takes it takes the filling up on
[40:29] the word it takes it takes the word
[40:32] coming in
[40:34] but you know what you'll never get there
[40:36] if you don't ever if you've never study
[40:39] if you never read if you never pray
[40:42] you know he said how do we get closer to
[40:44] God reading your Bible and praying if
[40:47] you read your Bible and pray if you get
[40:49] into the word then you know what the
[40:50] word is coming because if you have
[40:53] confidence in what you read
[40:56] you know how many times have you sat
[40:58] down and you you're tired you're weary
[41:00] you're upset and you start reading or
[41:02] you start listening to something and all
[41:05] of a sudden the more you begin to listen
[41:07] or the more you begin to read then all
[41:09] of a sudden your attitude begins to
[41:11] change something takes place inside of
[41:13] you that you've got to get rid of you
[41:15] know it's like well listen I'm gonna get
[41:16] up
[41:18] you know because the scripture says that
[41:20] you know when David was going through
[41:21] all of his hard times and his battles
[41:23] and his troubles and everything like
[41:24] that but the scripture says you know he
[41:26] encouraged himself
[41:28] well you know what he didn't what did he
[41:31] do he got away from the people that was
[41:33] hindering him he had to get to the place
[41:35] where it was just him and God
[41:38] you know as as the song says shut in
[41:41] with God in a secret place sometimes you
[41:44] got to get to a place and you know
[41:45] sometimes it's been on the roof of in
[41:48] this in the sun in the middle of the day
[41:51] and you're on the roof working and
[41:53] nobody else is around you but it's you
[41:54] and God
[41:57] sometimes it's driving down the road
[42:00] you get to a place where you get where
[42:02] it's just you and God but you got to get
[42:03] to a place where it's just you and God
[42:06] and you get to a place where God can
[42:08] speak to you
[42:10] and you can speak to God and listen to
[42:13] what he has to say to you
[42:16] and then when will you get to that place
[42:18] then
[42:19] the Lord will speak to you and you begin
[42:21] to you begin to feed on the things of
[42:23] God and you know then all things things
[42:25] begin to change
[42:27] sure right but you know as long as as
[42:30] long as you sit around and you listen to
[42:32] these things and you know
[42:35] I believe brother Rand was telling the
[42:36] story about the the lady that you know
[42:38] you know God had spoken to her and told
[42:40] her she was going to have a child and
[42:42] when when she went through all of that
[42:44] and struggling all that time and her
[42:46] preacher and her husband and all of her
[42:48] family come against her so you're not
[42:49] ever going to have that
[42:51] you know because their problems are too
[42:53] big they're you know all of that he's
[42:55] just some kind of soothsayer he just
[42:57] trying to get your money or just trying
[42:58] to build your build your hopes up
[43:02] all these type things oh and you know
[43:04] and then she came back and been you know
[43:06] apologized to brother Brandon he said
[43:07] but why did God say
[43:10] what did God say did God tell you he's
[43:12] going to have a child well I don't care
[43:14] he didn't know how many Devils whatever
[43:16] said you know what if God promised you
[43:18] that that you know what it's going to
[43:20] come to pass
[43:25] that's the thing about God you know
[43:26] God's not an Indian giver
[43:28] God's Not Too Short God's not God's not
[43:30] going to run out of anything
[43:34] thank you
[43:41] yeah I was just I was thinking this week
[43:45] you know I was I was looking at some
[43:46] things and you know what's so amazing is
[43:48] when you have these people
[43:50] and it's been about three or four times
[43:52] this week I've heard I've heard
[43:53] testimonies from people and and some of
[43:55] them are believers and you know people
[43:58] that are going through different you
[43:59] know going through hard times some
[44:00] people are facing surgeries or different
[44:02] things whatever issues are and it's so
[44:05] amazing because they said at times when
[44:07] when they've got in these situations all
[44:10] of a sudden the Lord has put somebody
[44:11] across their path
[44:14] to speak to them
[44:16] because one sister was telling that you
[44:19] know she's facing a surgery well she met
[44:21] a person that had the exact same surgery
[44:22] and it went great
[44:25] and everything went wonderful
[44:26] everything's been great it's like well
[44:28] the I believe the Lord put her in across
[44:30] my path to encourage my faith because if
[44:33] I got to go this route and praise God
[44:35] there's somebody else this went by that
[44:37] had to go through that same route and
[44:39] people people that have you know
[44:41] financial problems and people that have
[44:43] Wayward loved ones and things that are
[44:46] that they're facing and you know and
[44:48] some of them are people that are
[44:49] believers and they meet somebody that
[44:52] has a need that's facing a situation and
[44:55] it's like they come by and it's like
[44:56] well the Lord put them across my path
[44:58] because I was able to share my testimony
[45:00] with them and share and encourage that
[45:03] person
[45:05] well because if you haven't if you have
[45:07] a need if you've got a problem whatever
[45:09] the situation is you know what there's
[45:11] somebody that's been through that battle
[45:13] before that God has delivered and
[45:14] brought through and you know what some
[45:16] God will put somebody across your path
[45:18] to tell you listen don't quit don't give
[45:20] up don't don't just keep going why
[45:23] because there's what there's a brighter
[45:25] day ahead of you it's just right in
[45:27] front of you God is there to meet your
[45:29] need
[45:31] and many times well I don't know
[45:34] yes he's there and he's wanting to speak
[45:37] to you and tell you he's there
[45:40] and it's available
[45:45] you know
[45:46] there's many times people go through
[45:49] you know Financial hardships and and
[45:51] different problems and different things
[45:53] in their lives and I appreciate brother
[45:55] John and all of his his Sunday school
[45:57] lessons because you know what you know
[45:59] lots of people when you get to talking
[46:01] about money you know people get a little
[46:04] nervous
[46:05] they get a little bit of anxiety
[46:08] but let me tell you something one thing
[46:09] I appreciate about brother John when he
[46:11] gets up here there ain't no lack of
[46:13] faith and there ain't no lack of
[46:15] confidence in what God's done
[46:18] when he gets up here he's so positive
[46:22] why because he has seen God work and
[46:25] when you stand up here and you begin to
[46:27] talk about those things why why is it
[46:29] that people have anxiety about something
[46:31] why because they don't put their
[46:33] confidence in God
[46:35] if you had confidence in God you know
[46:37] what I know what the Bible says about
[46:40] handling money well then guess what then
[46:42] you got to do that
[46:45] but if you do that if you'll follow
[46:47] those principles as brother John was
[46:48] talking about if you've got confidence
[46:50] because I can't handle money
[46:53] and you know you say well I can't handle
[46:55] money if that's if that's your problem
[46:57] then guess what there's a plan in God's
[46:59] Bible that you can follow
[47:03] and guess what God will lead you through
[47:08] and the problem is is you got to put
[47:10] your trust well Lord you got to help me
[47:12] because I can't do this
[47:14] and it's just like well you know I I've
[47:17] got I've got I got a sickness I've got
[47:20] an illness I've got this problem
[47:22] I've got an infirmity whatever it is
[47:24] within you know what then God Is A
[47:26] Healer
[47:28] and then guess what we put our trust and
[47:31] our confidence in him and when you can't
[47:32] get out of bed in the morning then
[47:34] praise God then you know what the Holy
[47:36] Ghost will come and help you get out of
[47:37] the bed
[47:40] but you know what people think that's a
[47:41] joke
[47:45] but you know what that's true
[47:49] but people don't see that
[47:53] I was thinking about sister Dale being
[47:54] in that bedroom when Pop was on the
[47:57] ground
[47:59] when he was on her and Nanny was in
[48:01] there and all of a sudden somebody got
[48:04] him out of the floor
[48:06] and she didn't do it
[48:10] well then you know what there's a
[48:12] miracle that took place
[48:15] so you know what sometimes you know what
[48:17] that he will if God is the one that got
[48:19] him up out of the floor and got him in
[48:20] there then you know what God's the one
[48:21] who took care of him the rest of the
[48:22] time
[48:24] amen if God starts to work in you and
[48:26] already done one miracle though well I I
[48:28] don't know I don't know what's going to
[48:30] take place
[48:31] well you know what I don't have I don't
[48:33] have any worries I don't have any
[48:34] problems but because God's already done
[48:37] one work God's already done one Miracle
[48:39] then you know what he'll do another one
[48:40] he can do all of them but the problem is
[48:43] we just got to keep holding on and keep
[48:45] having faith and keep believing and keep
[48:46] thanking him for what he's done
[48:50] and just keep believing
[48:52] and if we just keep putting our faith in
[48:54] confidence in him then praise God it'll
[48:55] take place
[48:57] you don't want you we don't have to
[48:58] worry about it
[49:01] because God is the one that's in control
[49:07] but see the thing is is you've got to
[49:09] you've got to get to the word you've got
[49:12] to get in the word
[49:13] and the words got to get in you
[49:16] and you've got you've got to be just
[49:18] like that water park you just got to
[49:19] keep pouring the water in keep pouring
[49:21] the water in
[49:23] brother Brandon says
[49:26] and God God in his people he said
[49:29] there's a fountain open flowing freely
[49:31] everywhere just drink till you just
[49:34] can't drink no more
[49:36] the tree if it just drinks to what it
[49:40] was allotment
[49:41] why it was it would all just always
[49:44] still in the drought
[49:46] that's what's the matter with Christians
[49:48] they don't drink enough you want to
[49:51] drink till you just spread out and let
[49:53] everybody else see it
[49:56] say push out get a testimony committed
[49:58] to God believe it step out on it claim
[50:01] God's promise just commit it to God
[50:03] believe it commit thy ways unto the Lord
[50:06] he will bring it to pass whatever you
[50:09] want
[50:10] so if you just keep drinking in and
[50:12] pushing out then you know what as long
[50:14] as you're in the water then you know
[50:16] what it's going to take place
[50:19] because you plant you plant something
[50:22] his brother brother Wade's out playing
[50:24] his garden and everything you know and
[50:25] the water's got to be you know you get
[50:27] out there and you plant and then you hoe
[50:29] and you take care of fertilize and
[50:31] everything but you keep putting the
[50:32] water to it
[50:35] just well put all the seed in the ground
[50:37] and we're going to get out there with a
[50:38] hoe and we're going to hold this Dusty
[50:40] ground
[50:42] well if there's no moisture there then
[50:44] you know what you've stunted the growth
[50:47] you can have the seed you can hear the
[50:49] word and can be planted but if there's
[50:50] no water added to it it's not ever going
[50:53] to come up and you've got to stay in the
[50:55] word and keep adding water to that
[50:58] and if we just keep adding water we keep
[51:00] staying in then guess what it's got to
[51:01] take place
[51:03] you just keep saying it well I don't see
[51:05] a change well praise God just keep
[51:07] staying in it
[51:09] that's right
[51:11] you know because you know
[51:13] if you follow the laws of God then you
[51:17] know what it's got to take place
[51:20] man that's like you go getting this I
[51:22] mean how many of y'all got in the shower
[51:23] and said well you know I've been in here
[51:24] 30 minutes I'm still dry as a bone
[51:29] and I don't know why
[51:32] there's water everywhere but I'm still
[51:34] dry as a bone
[51:37] well no if you get in the presence of
[51:39] God
[51:40] then you know what it's got to do you've
[51:42] got to get into it you've got to get it
[51:44] something's got to take place there's
[51:46] got to be an effect of that
[51:49] so if you're if you're in the presence
[51:50] of God if you're in the word then you
[51:52] know what it's got to start to do a work
[51:53] on you
[51:56] but you know what sometimes we just
[51:57] don't get enough water
[52:00] brother said you know we just get enough
[52:02] water to to you know to get baptized so
[52:05] we get enough to you know pray for our
[52:07] forgiveness of sins but you know we
[52:09] don't stay in it long enough till the
[52:11] Lord comes in and begins to do a work
[52:13] until he begins to push out all these
[52:15] things until if it comes a place where
[52:18] it's everything is taken out
[52:22] foreign
[52:26] God's gifts always find their place when
[52:29] he when he's speaking of
[52:31] what the word is doing
[52:34] when the word comes he says hey here's
[52:36] what it's teaching us
[52:38] he said that God can use every faculty
[52:40] of our being
[52:42] if it's surrendered to him
[52:46] he said we've got to surrender it to him
[52:48] he said he can use our mind our dreams
[52:50] our subconscious our first conscious our
[52:52] tongue our songs our eyes our everything
[52:55] that we have can be used to God if it's
[52:58] committed to God see everything that you
[53:00] are committed to God he'll use every
[53:03] outlet and every part of you he'll use
[53:05] it no matter what it is he'll use it if
[53:08] it's Sanctified for his purpose and
[53:11] calling
[53:12] so if we begin to use these things why
[53:14] because the more we commit and begin to
[53:16] stay in this word and we begin to feed
[53:18] on this word and soak up this word soak
[53:20] up the water then as it takes place and
[53:23] you know what it's got to begin to
[53:24] change
[53:26] it's like well you know I I've been
[53:29] doing this for so long whatever whatever
[53:31] the case may be but you just stay with
[53:33] it
[53:34] you just keep doing God's going to do a
[53:37] work
[53:38] you know people talk about you know
[53:39] Abraham had to wait 25 years for a son
[53:43] you know and and you know and Noah he
[53:46] preached 120 years for for to a
[53:49] generation to see what was going to take
[53:51] place
[53:53] but you know one of the things I I
[53:55] always think about is that man who said
[53:57] at the pool and you know he was there
[53:59] and he had an infirmity
[54:01] well you know brother I've said he
[54:03] wasn't going to die of it
[54:06] but you know what he laid there
[54:08] 38 years
[54:12] now now when when Mo Noah was telling
[54:16] them for 120 years you got to get in the
[54:19] ark or you're going to die
[54:22] you know what it was a life or death
[54:24] situation
[54:25] you know they were there were other
[54:27] people that were in the in the scripture
[54:28] you know what they
[54:29] Moses gave them uh told the children of
[54:32] Israel listen it's a death life or death
[54:35] situation
[54:36] everybody had a lot but you know what
[54:38] this man didn't have a life or death
[54:39] situation
[54:42] but you know what he laid there for 38
[54:44] years with an infirmity
[54:47] but you know what he had the faith to
[54:49] hold on for 38 years
[54:52] and he still hold on still laid there
[54:54] and kept trying to get up when Jesus
[54:56] come to him and said wilt thou be made
[54:58] whole
[55:00] he said well Lord he said I've got
[55:02] nobody to put me in the water
[55:05] how many times had that the pool had
[55:07] been troubled by the angel how many
[55:10] times did that pull been troubled by the
[55:11] angel and that man struggled to get to
[55:14] the water struggling and when somebody
[55:16] got in ahead of him
[55:18] and he had to walk into feet and he had
[55:21] to crawl back to his mat laying there
[55:23] until the angel came again
[55:26] but you know what he never got he never
[55:28] gave up on that he never he never got
[55:30] tired why because there was a promise in
[55:32] the word and he stayed right there
[55:36] year after year I don't know how often
[55:38] the angel came but you know he laid
[55:40] there for 38 years
[55:43] no it wasn't going to kill him but you
[55:44] know what he gave up 38 years of his
[55:47] life
[55:48] holding on
[55:51] no matter how many you know if if it
[55:53] only had it happened one time that's
[55:55] disheartening
[55:57] but if you're like there and saying that
[55:59] happen two or three times
[56:03] and more and you know here's more people
[56:05] coming maybe maybe more people came to
[56:08] that pool Bethesda and laid around it
[56:11] maybe there was people laying around
[56:12] that pool and end up dying
[56:15] but you know what he laid right there at
[56:17] that pool
[56:18] and he laid right there and he kept
[56:20] waiting for the angel
[56:22] and he saw the the stirring of the water
[56:26] and he got up and he struggled every
[56:28] single time he kept trying to get to the
[56:30] water
[56:32] and you know what and somebody got ahead
[56:33] of him
[56:35] but he laid right there
[56:39] how disheartening was that how
[56:41] heartbreaking is to go through all of
[56:43] that and not get what you want but here
[56:45] come Jesus up to him and said wilt thou
[56:47] be made whole
[56:51] see the one who created the angel that
[56:54] created that created all things was
[56:57] standing in front of him the creator of
[56:58] the angel that came and troubled the
[57:00] waters was standing in front of him and
[57:01] said well thou be made whole
[57:04] he said Lord I'm trying
[57:06] I'm trying right
[57:08] but you know what Jesus didn't ask him
[57:10] about I got no man to get me into what
[57:11] he didn't ask him that he said will thou
[57:14] be made whole
[57:16] do you want to be made whole
[57:19] do you want to see a miracle take place
[57:23] do you want what your desire is
[57:26] 38 years in the making
[57:29] and he said yes
[57:32] then he said well just take up your bed
[57:34] and walk
[57:37] that's what it took when Jesus spoke
[57:39] those words to him then you know he
[57:41] could take Jesus at his word or he could
[57:43] have laid there
[57:46] after he laid there for 38 years having
[57:49] faith in what the scripture what the
[57:51] word said to because he had seen those
[57:53] things take place
[57:54] that that angel would come and Trouble
[57:56] the waters
[57:59] no doubt he'd seen other people come
[58:01] there get in the water and get healed
[58:02] and walk fine
[58:04] whatever they were
[58:06] but you know what it never changed it
[58:08] but you know what he got to the place
[58:09] you know what he's like well you know
[58:10] what
[58:11] I'm going to take him at his word
[58:13] I'm gonna get up
[58:17] maybe he had to scroll maybe he had to
[58:19] crawl over to the wall or slide over to
[58:20] the wall I don't know
[58:22] maybe Jesus helped him up
[58:24] maybe he got up on his own
[58:27] maybe he's all of a sudden you know he
[58:29] got his feet Underneath Him decided I'm
[58:30] going to stand up try this
[58:33] 38 years all of a sudden he's standing
[58:35] on his feet
[58:38] and so many times there are things in
[58:40] our lives
[58:41] that happened and maybe you know it may
[58:44] not be
[58:46] a great thing
[58:48] it's not a Salvation it's you
[58:51] but there's things that you that you
[58:53] know that that you know that are that
[58:55] are not right or you're facing problems
[58:57] and and you know the thing is is and
[58:59] sometimes we can get to the point where
[59:00] we just like well I'm just you know just
[59:03] going to live with it
[59:08] and it's like we don't see a way out
[59:11] we get discouraged by these things
[59:15] we can be just like that man
[59:18] but what about if Jesus was to come by
[59:20] and speak to you wilt thou be made whole
[59:24] well thou be delivered of that
[59:28] will you put your trust in me
[59:35] then we can put our
[59:37] confidence in God and do what he said
[59:43] see
[59:44] this is from perfect strength by Perfect
[59:46] weakness brother Emma speaking
[59:48] and he's talking about having the Holy
[59:50] Ghost
[59:52] he says I just received the Holy Ghost
[59:54] the other night Hallelujah
[59:57] he said you're going to make me do so
[59:59] and so
[1:00:00] he said God can't use a bit of that
[1:00:06] he says no whenever you get licked and
[1:00:10] you realize you're licked then you come
[1:00:13] back and humble yourself
[1:00:16] he said get weak you'll find out you're
[1:00:19] human
[1:00:20] he said and there's none of you
[1:00:22] intellectuals can do he said human
[1:00:24] weakness will never be used of God
[1:00:29] by the human weakness weaknesses pours
[1:00:33] themselves into you
[1:00:35] then he uses himself
[1:00:38] you just become an instrument certainly
[1:00:41] you've got to get yourself out of the
[1:00:44] way
[1:00:45] so when we get to the places when things
[1:00:47] happen see we've got to realize we've
[1:00:49] got weaknesses we've got shortcomings
[1:00:51] we've got problems but you know what God
[1:00:53] will work through those things
[1:00:56] your head
[1:00:58] because just like that man laying there
[1:01:00] beside that pool will thou be made whole
[1:01:03] but Jesus didn't have to drag him over
[1:01:05] to the pool he wanted him to have faith
[1:01:07] and confidence in what he said then get
[1:01:10] up
[1:01:12] so we have human weaknesses we've got
[1:01:14] problems we all do we all face things
[1:01:16] and we're all have complexes and
[1:01:19] different things that we have to deal
[1:01:21] with
[1:01:22] but the thing is is you know what
[1:01:24] through God will use it when we when he
[1:01:26] pours himself into those situations
[1:01:29] Daniel he can work through those
[1:01:33] you know you know so many times when
[1:01:35] brother Brandon was standing up and he'd
[1:01:36] be talking and talking about all the
[1:01:38] things that he had went through you know
[1:01:40] temper and the different things that he
[1:01:42] had been through in his life
[1:01:45] you know a lot of people they wouldn't
[1:01:46] have stood up and told all the things
[1:01:47] brother Branham did
[1:01:49] I you know because people don't you know
[1:01:51] I'm not going to tell you all of my
[1:01:53] shortcomings I'm not going to tell you
[1:01:54] all my thoughts
[1:01:55] but you know what brother Brown was an
[1:01:56] open book
[1:01:58] and began to tell everybody all the
[1:02:00] things that that he had done
[1:02:03] why because he wanted you to understand
[1:02:05] he was a man just like everybody else he
[1:02:08] had faults and failures and shortcomings
[1:02:10] and you know what but you know what God
[1:02:12] had Grace to bring him through all those
[1:02:14] things
[1:02:16] recruit and so the thing is is
[1:02:18] when you have these shortcomings and God
[1:02:21] can use he said he said you just become
[1:02:24] an instrument for God to use
[1:02:28] you know many times when people stand
[1:02:30] you know when brother man would be
[1:02:31] calling a prayer line and he'd be
[1:02:32] calling people up and you know he'd tell
[1:02:34] people standing in the prayer line
[1:02:36] he'd tell them listen if you've got
[1:02:38] unconfessed sins if you've got a problem
[1:02:40] he said get out of the line
[1:02:43] you need to get out of the line
[1:02:45] but you know what and he told me he said
[1:02:47] y'all need to make that right
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:52] I was listening to a brother the other
[1:02:53] day and he said you know there's never
[1:02:54] been a place where brother Branham got
[1:02:56] up and told him said y'all such horrible
[1:02:58] people I don't know why y'all even get
[1:02:59] in the prayer line because y'all know
[1:03:01] y'all got unconfessed sin
[1:03:04] and how do you expect God to do anything
[1:03:05] for you
[1:03:07] no he told me he said get out of the
[1:03:09] line and make that right
[1:03:12] why because God was speaking to them
[1:03:14] listen there's something that's going to
[1:03:15] hinder your healing but you need to get
[1:03:17] whatever you're looking for through from
[1:03:19] God he said you're here and God can meet
[1:03:22] your need but the problem is is you know
[1:03:24] you've got something you need to take
[1:03:25] care of that and so he didn't try to
[1:03:27] tell him well don't get in the prayer
[1:03:28] line
[1:03:29] no take care of it and get in the prayer
[1:03:31] line
[1:03:33] don't let anything hinder you
[1:03:36] whatever the issue is then let God come
[1:03:38] on the scene that he can take care of
[1:03:40] that and if you if you're just allowing
[1:03:42] then he can work through those things
[1:03:46] so if you've got any issues it's like
[1:03:48] brother Brown you know he had faults and
[1:03:49] failures but you know what he wanted to
[1:03:51] show the people that that was Grace that
[1:03:53] God was working through him
[1:03:56] well why because everybody well you know
[1:03:58] God spoke that was that was God's
[1:04:00] mouthpiece and he was a prophet yeah but
[1:04:03] he was a human being
[1:04:05] and he went through all the same well
[1:04:06] you know everybody you know because they
[1:04:08] try to put brother Bradham in the same
[1:04:10] category they put Jesus in and you know
[1:04:12] Jesus Jesus never had a problem
[1:04:17] well you know what Jesus faced all the
[1:04:19] problems that you you face all the same
[1:04:22] Devils he faced all the same thing
[1:04:25] and brother Brandon did too and guess
[1:04:27] what and brother Branham was a human and
[1:04:29] failed
[1:04:31] but you know what he didn't change who
[1:04:33] he was he didn't change his ministry
[1:04:37] all right brother but you know what he
[1:04:39] had to go and had to go make things
[1:04:41] right he had to go pray through
[1:04:44] and he was showing that we got he done
[1:04:46] those things and you know what he didn't
[1:04:48] change well you know what
[1:04:50] brother Brown told a lie I said you know
[1:04:52] what I just I'm gonna get rid of my
[1:04:54] books
[1:04:58] brother Brian I'm hungo hung across from
[1:05:01] the mirror in his car
[1:05:05] well I don't know if I can have
[1:05:06] confidence in him or not
[1:05:11] William is a human
[1:05:14] and sometimes we're gonna the devil
[1:05:16] likes to get those little things and you
[1:05:18] know he'll he'll the devil will get
[1:05:19] those things in your mind and he'll roll
[1:05:21] them around and around and around and
[1:05:23] around you know you waste the whole day
[1:05:25] with listening to the things the devil's
[1:05:27] got to say
[1:05:28] true
[1:05:30] he'll be on your shoulder and just and
[1:05:33] just I mean just oh man it's so draining
[1:05:36] sometimes
[1:05:39] but you know sometimes it's good just
[1:05:41] get in the word
[1:05:44] just like uh I can't remember who the
[1:05:47] man's name was the brother but brother I
[1:05:48] think brother Dale used to talk about
[1:05:50] that man and he was like well you know
[1:05:51] the devil always talking to me so well
[1:05:53] devil we're going to read some of the
[1:05:54] Bible today let's look over here and
[1:05:55] we'll read this right here we'll get in
[1:05:57] and start reading the scripture we'll go
[1:05:59] read the scripture together
[1:06:01] now all of a sudden you know what he
[1:06:03] didn't want to read the scripture
[1:06:04] anymore
[1:06:05] why because you know what that was
[1:06:07] contrary to what he was trying to tell
[1:06:08] him
[1:06:09] we're going to get in over here where
[1:06:11] it's something positive we're going to
[1:06:12] read something that's good
[1:06:14] that's what God said we're going to get
[1:06:15] into this
[1:06:18] why because that's what God wants us to
[1:06:19] do
[1:06:20] it get into this
[1:06:22] that we can reflect him
[1:06:24] that we make himself known
[1:06:28] see we begin to see these things if we
[1:06:30] can just surrender ourselves our
[1:06:32] complete being
[1:06:34] see then we become what God wants us to
[1:06:37] be
[1:06:38] he said he says I believe this is from
[1:06:41] the statue of a perfect man he said see
[1:06:43] when you surrender your complete being
[1:06:45] then the Holy Spirit just pours through
[1:06:47] you and these virtues then you're a
[1:06:51] living Tabernacle then people look out
[1:06:53] and say that's a man full of virtue
[1:06:56] knowledge he believes the word
[1:06:58] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:07:00] kindness full of the love of the Holy
[1:07:03] Ghost see there he is walking around
[1:07:05] what is it a stature that unbelievers
[1:07:08] can look at and say there is a Christian
[1:07:11] there is a man or a woman who knows what
[1:07:14] they're talking about
[1:07:16] see if we can get to those things where
[1:07:18] we can get them poured in
[1:07:21] everything it gets poured in
[1:07:24] all those virtues
[1:07:27] all all the the holy spirit all those
[1:07:30] things get poured in
[1:07:31] then when you when you get full on those
[1:07:34] things
[1:07:35] then you can be used of God
[1:07:38] then all of a sudden it begins to flow
[1:07:40] out from you
[1:07:43] has he talked about those Rivers
[1:07:46] flowing out
[1:07:49] see when it begins to overflow and
[1:07:51] begins then it becomes out
[1:07:53] just like when they filled those those
[1:07:55] water pots filled up then they were able
[1:07:58] to scoop that out and take it
[1:08:01] and it's like wow what took place it was
[1:08:03] a miracle
[1:08:05] but that's what God wants from us
[1:08:09] Lord let us fill me up Lord
[1:08:11] that I can teach others Lord that I can
[1:08:14] be used of God lord fill me up
[1:08:18] Lord let me empty myself of everything
[1:08:20] that's not like you
[1:08:23] to be filled up
[1:08:26] that we can be given out
[1:08:29] to be emptied out
[1:08:32] to those that need it
[1:08:34] because you know there's one thing God
[1:08:36] didn't God didn't fill us up just to be
[1:08:38] full
[1:08:41] so if God give you know through
[1:08:45] justification if he takes us
[1:08:48] and he jumps offer all our past sins and
[1:08:51] brings us in
[1:08:53] and through sanctification he cleans us
[1:08:56] and sets us aside for service
[1:09:00] that he wants to fill us
[1:09:03] brother Graham said he wants to fill us
[1:09:04] to put us in service
[1:09:07] God just didn't do that just just to
[1:09:09] have some Us full of the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:12] wants us to be used for us to be used to
[1:09:14] be instrumentalities
[1:09:16] the living breathing instrumentalities
[1:09:19] of Jesus Christ that the world can see
[1:09:24] to help those that haven't that have
[1:09:26] needs that have problems why because you
[1:09:30] know what you know nobody nobody's going
[1:09:32] to be able to do it all by themselves
[1:09:35] it takes one another it takes everybody
[1:09:38] working together
[1:09:42] and the main thing is is
[1:09:45] you know don't get our eyes on somebody
[1:09:47] else but what you have called me to Lord
[1:09:50] asked what I want to do
[1:09:53] it's not big eyes and little use or
[1:09:55] anything like that but it's to be called
[1:09:56] to what God has called us to whatever
[1:09:59] little small part it is if whatever part
[1:10:02] of the body is that that's what I want
[1:10:04] to be I want to be a part of the body I
[1:10:05] want to be effective part of the body of
[1:10:08] Jesus Christ I want to be the
[1:10:14] to be full
[1:10:16] kin
[1:10:17] use me
[1:10:19] that can be given out to be emptied out
[1:10:21] to be poured out upon people
[1:10:25] that's that's all Stan will have the
[1:10:26] musicians come
[1:10:28] I want to I want to sing that song
[1:10:30] tonight
[1:10:31] I want to live the way he wants me to
[1:10:34] live
[1:10:35] I want to give until there's just no
[1:10:38] more to give why because I want to be
[1:10:40] full
[1:10:42] I want to be filled up that I can be
[1:10:45] given out that I can be emptied out that
[1:10:47] I can flow
[1:10:49] that these virtues are in me that they
[1:10:51] can be given out
[1:10:53] the people that need strength
[1:10:57] they can they can draw on us
[1:11:09] that we can all stand
[1:11:12] and do the what the part that God has
[1:11:14] given us to do the journey
[1:11:17] to come into the full stature of Jesus
[1:11:20] Christ
