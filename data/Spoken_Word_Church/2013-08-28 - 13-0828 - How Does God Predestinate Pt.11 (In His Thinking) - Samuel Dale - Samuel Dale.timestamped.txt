[2:58] each thought tonight in your word in
[3:00] Jesus name amen
[3:03] Romans 8.
[3:06] 28 and we know that all things work
[3:09] together for good to them that love God
[3:10] to them who are the called according to
[3:13] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[3:16] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[3:19] the image of his son that he might be
[3:22] the firstborn among many brethren
[3:24] moreover whom he did predestinate
[3:27] them he also called and whom he called
[3:30] him he also justified in whom he
[3:32] justified them he also glorified
[3:35] you know just past tense already done
[3:37] set up everything all right
[3:40] what shall we then say to these things
[3:42] if God be for us
[3:45] who can be against us amen
[3:47] let's go over to Isaiah and just read a
[3:49] word to our from where we've been
[3:52] quoting a lot about it and things and
[3:54] let's just read it
[3:55] in uh Isaiah 55 verse 6.
[4:01] says seek ye the Lord while he may be
[4:04] found call you upon him while he is near
[4:07] let the wicked forsake their way and the
[4:09] unrighteous man his thoughts and let
[4:12] them return unto the Lord and He will
[4:14] have mercy upon him and to our and to
[4:18] our God for the he will abundantly
[4:21] pardon
[4:23] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[4:25] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[4:28] Lord for as the heavens are higher than
[4:30] the earth so are my ways higher than
[4:33] your ways and my thoughts than your
[4:36] thoughts amen you may be seated the Lord
[4:38] that is blessing to the reading of the
[4:41] word
[4:43] now
[4:45] we're stop we're still on the point of
[4:48] dealing with how does God predestinate
[4:52] and we've been dealing with that for
[4:55] quite a while now and we see that he
[4:57] predestinates by foreknowledge
[5:00] and we know then that for knowledge
[5:03] becomes before predestination I keep
[5:06] saying that over and over and it's uh
[5:08] you know I say a lot of things over and
[5:11] over and over
[5:13] you know why
[5:15] because most people's brains don't run
[5:17] correctly and mine is one of them and if
[5:21] I'm not repetitive
[5:23] then you know you won't get my point I
[5:27] don't want any thought to be whatsoever
[5:30] of us being any form or whatsoever or
[5:35] maybe take away the word form
[5:38] um persons or personalities or or people
[5:42] or anything like that uh
[5:46] in heaven before the world ever begun
[5:49] and and I keep putting that there before
[5:51] you because I know that that a lot of
[5:54] doctrines are out there about the the
[5:57] predestinations and the things you know
[5:59] but I I want to hold that before you to
[6:02] where no matter what I would be saying
[6:04] you remember that this is what he's
[6:07] saying
[6:09] and then you come along say yeah but
[6:10] what he what he's doing he's trying to
[6:12] trick us you know he's he's about no no
[6:14] I don't try to trick anything I've never
[6:16] been that way I just don't have any
[6:18] ability to trick I just have what I am
[6:22] and that is to just study the word and
[6:25] believe what it says all right and in
[6:28] doing that then we know that the prophet
[6:30] of God is the the one that brings us the
[6:33] message and he's told us over and over
[6:35] that foreknowledge
[6:37] comes before predestination all right
[6:40] and that's the only way that God can
[6:42] predestinate without him being choosing
[6:46] whatsoever now when we get on into it
[6:50] now if you're noticing we're over past
[6:52] the line going in back into God's mind
[6:57] all right and in doing that then just
[7:00] remember that his mind cannot be
[7:03] anything different from what happens in
[7:06] reality
[7:07] because the I kept saying that there are
[7:10] Sunday the fact of foreknowledge means
[7:13] the knowledge before
[7:15] that's simple to me it's just you have
[7:17] knowledge before and God's the only one
[7:19] who can have those things
[7:20] but in doing it see looking back then we
[7:23] see that
[7:27] God had a plan and a purpose
[7:30] or a motive
[7:33] you know there's another quote over a
[7:35] plan and a purpose we'll get back to
[7:36] that in another message because it's in
[7:38] the middle of it and I didn't want to
[7:40] read part of it
[7:42] that he had a plan and a purpose
[7:44] Sovereign plan right
[7:46] right across the mystery of God reveals
[7:48] he's got a motive in doing
[7:51] in order to let himself be expressed
[7:55] so then whatever we tie together we must
[7:58] put it together in the order of thinking
[8:01] about and lining it up to be able to
[8:04] come back to where we would look at his
[8:06] uh plan and purpose or motive
[8:11] you know see it would have to tie
[8:14] together to where it would not be
[8:15] contradictory
[8:17] to other thoughts
[8:21] and all of it would line up together and
[8:24] and we would see a beautiful picture in
[8:26] the word of God
[8:28] because if it's not by foreknowledge
[8:31] then what are you going to go by
[8:33] see if it's not foreknowledge first
[8:35] you're predetermining right
[8:37] right and if you're predetermining then
[8:40] you know
[8:42] we just forget it because
[8:45] well if we happen to fall on the lucky
[8:46] side
[8:49] and I don't mean that sarcastically I
[8:51] just mean it true because that's just
[8:53] the way people are we happen to be a
[8:55] certain seed you know if it's in Adam
[8:59] that's the way they used to preach it
[9:00] you could be saved but if you come from
[9:03] the Beast you couldn't be saved
[9:06] well
[9:07] time you got to the flood you had a
[9:09] problem
[9:10] and then when you get over to Jacob and
[9:11] Esau coming from the same holy Mom and
[9:13] Daddy
[9:15] you see I keep bringing those things up
[9:17] because that I know what people teach
[9:22] and what they're trying to plant into
[9:24] the people's minds but I want you and I
[9:27] to keep it in the correct line so if I
[9:29] repeat anything just remember maybe it's
[9:32] for me all right so you just forgive me
[9:35] and pass on to the next message and lay
[9:38] out a couple of services and catch back
[9:40] up somewhere down the line because
[9:41] everybody thinks I repeat myself so much
[9:43] so you've missed three or four services
[9:45] and then you just come back and then you
[9:47] can catch up and just go right on and
[9:49] and don't listen to what's in between
[9:51] but that's all right that's your
[9:53] business if you don't listen we have
[9:55] made ever effort a possible of the
[9:59] internet systems to work in the tape
[10:02] recorders and the things or the the
[10:04] doings that the word that you have no
[10:06] excuse of saying well I wasn't there
[10:08] that service so I'm not going to take
[10:10] the time hey we got a good run coming in
[10:13] we got a Dale coming in
[10:16] yeah good to see you really
[10:18] yeah that's
[10:20] he's dead on the front end
[10:24] I'm the back end Dale okay
[10:27] all right but good to see you brother
[10:30] Dave
[10:31] for the robbers yeah
[10:33] but now think about it
[10:36] for knowledge
[10:38] is the most wonderful thought
[10:41] that you could ever have
[10:44] because by thinking about it
[10:49] and you're looking at it and you're
[10:51] seeing that by foreknowledge
[10:53] then you do have something to do
[10:58] with your life and your beings
[11:01] now sure we know salvations of the Lord
[11:03] and I know the quotes come on
[11:05] the prophet will say you had nothing to
[11:07] do with your salvation amen that's
[11:08] exactly right because you couldn't save
[11:10] yourself
[11:11] but if you didn't accept it
[11:15] you must accept it because he will not
[11:18] override your free moral agency all
[11:21] right now then as we we've read over and
[11:24] over and quoted many times brother
[11:26] random says on on this God change his
[11:29] mind uh
[11:31] see God couldn't purposely lose anything
[11:35] and then redeem it
[11:39] couldn't do it that way he says he
[11:41] couldn't
[11:43] now why would we want to think of those
[11:45] things with that order but see he put
[11:47] man on free Mortal agency
[11:50] but be in God he goes into marriage and
[11:53] divorce and says
[11:55] to take and to lose it just in order to
[11:59] save it would be disconplementary to his
[12:02] own doings
[12:04] but see we're so uh relevated until we
[12:09] we think nothing about those things
[12:13] but if we approach everything by
[12:15] foreknowledge
[12:17] then we can see
[12:20] and we can back up because we've been I
[12:22] haven't denied any quote yet have I if I
[12:25] have bring me one you know of any quote
[12:27] that he's brought I've tried to to bring
[12:30] them all in until you know not everyone
[12:32] because you'd uh I've I've told you if
[12:35] you just start in 1963 and go through 65
[12:38] you're going to hear of the things that
[12:40] I'm trying my best to express to you
[12:44] but see then in doing that then keeping
[12:48] our thoughts
[12:49] to the bases that
[12:52] God then could actually dwell alone
[12:57] with his thoughts
[13:01] and that not be people
[13:03] man so you don't realize those things
[13:05] are Mormon doctrines
[13:07] and things like that are coming down
[13:08] from organized religion the prophet of
[13:10] God said ever a denomination Doctrine
[13:12] and things come out of Genesis so you
[13:15] can go back in Genesis with it you know
[13:16] and find out
[13:18] but just trying to get you to look at it
[13:19] that he doesn't predestinate by his
[13:22] desires because he desired that
[13:25] everybody be saved
[13:26] all right so now what kind of a God are
[13:28] you making him to be if you're coming up
[13:31] with all of these predetermined factors
[13:34] and situations
[13:37] yet I've told you over and over we're
[13:38] going back into the very back part of
[13:41] God's Mind by way of the prophet
[13:44] and by way of that and thinking about it
[13:46] and seeing him
[13:49] and seeing what he has
[13:52] looked down through time and saw that
[13:54] would be
[13:57] but that's not all of his doings
[14:00] because he had attributes in him as a
[14:02] savior A Healer
[14:03] Etc
[14:04] before anybody was ever lost
[14:08] those were in him at the beginning when
[14:10] he dwelt alone
[14:13] and by being that then
[14:17] you and I are a display
[14:21] and what a wonderful thought
[14:23] that we could think about
[14:27] I know you don't think the way I do I'm
[14:29] I'm glad of that mostly because it'd be
[14:32] a messed up world but sometimes I think
[14:34] I do get a little good thought you know
[14:36] every once in a while
[14:37] but to just think about
[14:41] that God came down here to share eternal
[14:44] life with you and I
[14:50] but yet we want some kind of a doings to
[14:53] her that
[14:54] if you go into the predetermining
[14:57] doctrines and the ideas and thoughts of
[14:59] man you'll get to the point that you
[15:01] don't need God
[15:05] right
[15:06] I mean you don't need him
[15:09] and he's nothing personal to you
[15:13] he's just sitting over the end of this
[15:14] thing waiting when it's all to finish
[15:17] but thinking about foreknowledge
[15:21] the prophet said he knew who would want
[15:23] to be saved
[15:25] and who wouldn't
[15:27] he said Darby he could have it for them
[15:31] he came and died for everybody in the
[15:33] world right
[15:34] but everybody in the world is not going
[15:36] to accept it
[15:37] right all right now if he could could uh
[15:42] set back before the world and think
[15:45] about it
[15:46] and plan it out
[15:49] look what you would have
[15:53] our thinking as reading I read that
[15:55] scripture that our thoughts are not his
[15:57] thoughts
[15:59] his thoughts are so much brother Colony
[16:00] spoke on that probably what 40 years ago
[16:06] his thoughts are so great our thoughts
[16:09] are not even in the picture the best
[16:10] thoughts we could have
[16:14] and look what it took
[16:18] it took a profit 30 something years
[16:21] to bring a message
[16:24] to get you and I to a place that we
[16:26] could look
[16:27] without having to bypass everything
[16:31] and say he was wrong here and wrong here
[16:34] and should have said this there in order
[16:36] done this year and
[16:38] yeah
[16:40] but yet people just Joyce about that you
[16:43] know yeah that's right he should have
[16:44] done it that way well just remember his
[16:46] thoughts is greater than yours
[16:49] so that thought you got is stupid
[16:52] any other language you need to use
[16:54] dumb
[16:56] that's as best as you can say it
[16:59] even a good thought the best we could do
[17:02] with it what's it going to be
[17:04] God cannot have a new thought the
[17:06] prophet said
[17:08] now what are you going to do
[17:11] what kind of thoughts do we have we can
[17:13] change them every 30 seconds probably
[17:15] less than that
[17:17] but he can never
[17:20] and then when he said it
[17:24] he took from his thoughts
[17:27] you know
[17:28] and he put into word form
[17:32] those thoughts
[17:35] and once putting it into word form
[17:39] that's why we can depend upon what he's
[17:41] saying
[17:43] because he can't change
[17:46] then we just got to find our own selves
[17:49] and see where we're at
[17:51] sure we're going to get to I believe
[17:55] all the prophet has taught us I've been
[17:57] over and over and we keep going over and
[17:59] over he said if you have eternal life
[18:01] tonight you always was eternal
[18:05] right I can say Amen to that
[18:07] but then he says You must be born again
[18:09] I say Amen to that now you can't say
[18:11] Amen to both of them
[18:15] if you've got a dog a Doctrine or idea
[18:17] of pre-existences and things
[18:21] see you can't Amen to all the whole word
[18:23] I can so I opened it up to the public
[18:26] then you know if I'm off come and show
[18:28] me
[18:29] I want to be right
[18:32] but don't come up with silly ideas
[18:35] well we'll give you quotes we got 200
[18:37] quotes here go ahead
[18:40] you keep studying long enough you might
[18:42] find something
[18:44] you know what I mean by that
[18:47] you might get caught by the truth
[18:50] by searching out to try to prove
[18:52] somebody wrong so go ahead but listen
[18:57] see if we have eternal life today
[19:01] that life that he's talking about is
[19:03] what it is
[19:04] right it's not me and you
[19:07] there was a time we didn't have eternal
[19:09] life
[19:10] we haven't always was eternal
[19:13] I just feel it I just I just well it
[19:16] never was on feeling
[19:21] it's not what God says
[19:23] he says You must be born again the
[19:25] Nicodemus
[19:29] now Nicodemus had a pretty good
[19:31] understanding of the word
[19:34] you agree
[19:38] but when he said you must be born again
[19:39] he said boy you blowed me
[19:43] you know I don't understand what you're
[19:44] talking about
[19:46] he said well there's no need me talking
[19:48] to you about it
[19:51] because see there's really no need of
[19:53] talking to anybody about God unless
[19:55] they've got the same God living within
[19:57] them
[20:02] because the Bible says no man can call
[20:03] Jesus the Christ
[20:05] what
[20:06] except it be by the Christ that's within
[20:09] you
[20:11] but see we we make statements and talks
[20:14] in in all
[20:19] but not thinking about
[20:21] we're dealing with an eternal God I said
[20:24] something there Sunday that I wanted to
[20:27] make sure you understood
[20:29] and uh you know you'd be surprised
[20:33] how people are
[20:36] and I made a simple statement
[20:39] I wonder how many of you had ever really
[20:41] thought about
[20:43] charging with this is it just a little I
[20:45] thought of today I thought well I need
[20:46] to clear that up real good
[20:49] I said
[20:51] God's name is Jesus
[20:58] now is that really ever dawned on you
[21:03] have you ever really thought about it
[21:07] or what kind of a name are you trying to
[21:09] find
[21:13] Jehovah's not a name
[21:15] Yahweh is not a name
[21:20] elohim's not a name
[21:25] what is the name of God
[21:27] well if we could just find his name
[21:29] his name is Jesus
[21:35] Christ his name is Jesus and the prophet
[21:37] of God said
[21:40] everything is named Jesus for it's the
[21:44] only name that God ever had
[21:52] that's why they couldn't pronounce it as
[21:54] jvhv see they just couldn't get it there
[21:56] was no vowels or what you say to
[21:58] pronounce it
[22:00] but his name was Jesus
[22:04] what a simple thought
[22:06] but do you really know what that means
[22:11] we're quick to say well ask anything in
[22:14] my name
[22:15] so we ask in Jesus name we're asking
[22:17] Jesus name
[22:22] but you know what's the worst thing
[22:23] about it is is people not being honest
[22:25] enough to admit
[22:27] where we've been tied up at
[22:31] I told you about it when the man came to
[22:33] the church there wasn't a Baptist Church
[22:35] and increased all you do and word indeed
[22:37] do all in the name of Jesus Christ
[22:41] that church would never pray in the name
[22:43] of Jesus Christ they prayed for the for
[22:45] God's sake or in his name
[22:47] whole church
[22:50] preachers and all they wouldn't say in
[22:52] the name of Jesus
[22:55] they started praying in the name of
[22:57] Jesus
[22:58] well that was good
[23:01] but you know what I've seen and I had to
[23:02] go get baptized
[23:05] that's what I saw
[23:07] because if his name was Jesus I couldn't
[23:09] hang on to father son Holy Ghost any
[23:11] longer
[23:12] I had to find something because
[23:15] father son Holy Ghost not a name
[23:20] but the Simplicity of it I mean do we
[23:22] really even think about it
[23:24] that God's never had but one name
[23:30] right and his name is Jesus
[23:35] see everybody in the message now want to
[23:37] find some kind of a new name since
[23:38] they've got a little bit of a thought
[23:40] but my thought is have we exhausted the
[23:42] name of Jesus yet
[23:44] do my understanding the name of Jesus
[23:46] must remain until the Redemptive plan is
[23:49] done
[23:51] I mean if I'm wrong there somebody show
[23:53] me
[23:54] that's all I know
[23:56] because it's the name of Jesus
[24:00] means Redeemer
[24:04] then the prophet would make a statement
[24:06] and people don't want to read that he
[24:07] said maybe no one we get tired
[24:11] fine with a new name if he wants God
[24:13] wants to give it
[24:15] right but what is it going to be related
[24:17] to his name has never been nothing but
[24:19] Jesus
[24:22] but yet brother random will say you can
[24:24] call him Jesus Jesus and not get nothing
[24:30] why
[24:33] why did you say Jesus Jesus is together
[24:36] and not get nothing somebody else come
[24:38] along and just say Jesus
[24:43] and they just get what they're asking
[24:45] for
[24:49] you know God knows whether or not we
[24:51] know what that name is
[24:53] you remember the little woman there in
[24:54] the Bible that said thou son of David
[24:56] have mercy on me
[24:58] he wouldn't even listen to her
[25:01] why she wasn't a Jewish he was a gentile
[25:04] she had no reason or thoughts to connect
[25:06] to him
[25:08] but when she said my Lord
[25:11] that stopped him and he came and gave
[25:13] her what she asked for
[25:17] amen you see the name of Jesus
[25:20] when a prophet would come along and
[25:22] would say
[25:25] God chosen place of worship in God's
[25:28] name is given to him
[25:31] he's God's
[25:33] place of worship
[25:35] and God's name is given to him
[25:44] the name of Jesus
[25:49] do we really think about that
[25:54] when he come and say like this God's
[25:57] provided place of worship His Name Was
[25:58] God
[25:59] how many titles
[26:01] God is a title itself was a call Jehovah
[26:05] Gyra Jehovah jovik
[26:08] Manasseh he was called a Rose of Sharon
[26:11] and Lily of the Valley Morning Star
[26:14] father son Holy Ghost
[26:16] but his name
[26:18] God's name is Jesus Christ
[26:25] God's name
[26:26] The Only Name that God ever had
[26:30] but everybody wants to know what his
[26:32] name is
[26:36] his name is Jesus
[26:39] many titles but his name is Jesus
[26:43] and in his son he placed his name that's
[26:46] on God's provided place of worship
[26:48] paragraph 136.
[26:51] God has only provided way it isn't
[26:53] Methodist Presbyterian but it's Jesus
[26:56] Christ by the new birth believe in that
[26:58] Bible that's God's provided way and the
[27:01] only way that he has is in Jesus Christ
[27:04] his son and his son he placed his name
[27:07] his God's name is Jesus because he came
[27:11] in his father's name and so that would
[27:13] be God's name because he was God
[27:17] how much more simple can we be
[27:22] what I got to thinking about reason I
[27:24] said I believe need to cover it
[27:26] is we think well if if Jesus if the name
[27:29] of Jesus if the name of God is Jesus why
[27:32] didn't brother Branham emphasize that
[27:34] over and over and over
[27:37] why don't you go turn a telephone when
[27:39] you get home tonight and listen to it no
[27:42] matter what it is from 47 to 65.
[27:46] and see if he's not explaining the name
[27:49] of God
[27:55] you might say he's the chosen place of
[27:57] worship
[28:03] Jesus said I come in my father's name
[28:06] every son comes in in father's name
[28:11] what's the name of the father
[28:14] how many times have you heard him say
[28:15] that
[28:16] he's okay now let's let's go through
[28:18] what he said it's you know it says in
[28:20] the name of the father son holy said
[28:22] what's the name of the father
[28:24] he says Jesus he said what's the name of
[28:27] the son Jesus what's the name of the
[28:29] Holy Ghost Jesus
[28:31] now we don't baptize Jesus Jesus Jesus
[28:34] do we
[28:39] no
[28:40] we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:42] Christ
[28:45] because that way it covers every title
[28:48] talk or anything time together with that
[28:51] one name
[28:53] that's the only name that God ever had
[28:56] why are we looking for some name
[29:01] well I'm sure you where the Prophet was
[29:02] looking for a name
[29:04] amen
[29:08] but what is it
[29:11] did he ever tell what it was
[29:17] but how many people admit and to be
[29:18] honest about themselves and thinking but
[29:20] they no they won't do that to hide it
[29:23] first time you've heard me tell you
[29:24] first time we went to Jeffersonville
[29:27] I was sitting there looking around you
[29:28] know and I thought
[29:30] and my thoughts was about the name of
[29:32] the Lord and different things and
[29:34] I looked up there and right onto that
[29:36] cross under there was INRI
[29:39] I wrote that down I run around our
[29:42] brother molt in the service is over I
[29:43] said brother mode
[29:45] what does it mean i n r i
[29:50] he said that was Latin or Greek or what
[29:53] it was written in so it means Jesus
[29:54] Christ King of the Jews I said okay see
[29:56] you later
[29:58] I didn't tell him what I was thinking I
[30:01] thought I'd found his new name
[30:08] but will you just be honest enough to
[30:10] think about it
[30:15] if we're going to be Miss Jesus when we
[30:17] get over there
[30:21] and I want to hold on to that name don't
[30:23] you
[30:26] because that is the name of almighty God
[30:29] and that almighty God is eternal
[30:31] self-existing I am all the title of
[30:34] whatsoever in his name is Jesus
[30:42] could we approach my point
[30:45] okay
[30:47] my point are you listening
[30:50] what's your point about the name
[30:52] what was your point Sunday about tonight
[30:55] if we approach
[30:57] predestinations and foreknowledges and
[31:00] things like that
[31:03] with our own thinking we're going to
[31:05] wind up
[31:07] being no different than trying to find
[31:09] some certain name when he's already told
[31:11] us his name
[31:15] looking for something that we're trying
[31:17] to find
[31:19] looking for some way but but brother
[31:21] Dale I know but when brother so-and-so
[31:24] preaches about
[31:26] I always was eternal I just feel so I
[31:29] just it just Thrills me
[31:31] but when you say it I just well you know
[31:37] you know the why because you know what
[31:39] I'm talking about
[31:43] you know that I'm not talking about
[31:45] coming into the world with eternal life
[31:48] dwelling inside of you
[31:51] and just waiting for somebody to click
[31:54] the light bulb where it could turn on
[32:00] and I didn't need nothing I always was
[32:02] eternal
[32:05] but see you know that other person is
[32:07] talking about something else
[32:09] and remember Sunday
[32:12] what is the big guy we face
[32:15] ego
[32:18] ego
[32:20] ego stirs this man
[32:24] revelation
[32:26] you can walk on
[32:30] you understand the reason of bringing it
[32:32] up
[32:34] are we approaching these things just by
[32:37] thoughts if you notice I'm laying in
[32:39] about one God I'm talking about
[32:43] you know he's thinking and you and I and
[32:45] our relationship
[32:48] and we'll get to it
[32:52] because I don't believe in
[32:55] eternal sonship
[33:01] see we only place that is to being about
[33:04] Jesus
[33:11] are we a child of God that has eternal
[33:13] life being part of the father are we a
[33:16] child by impartation
[33:18] from something else
[33:21] which one is it
[33:26] the way that I'm headed now I'm warning
[33:28] you ahead of time I don't believe in
[33:34] eternal sonship
[33:38] I don't believe anymore
[33:40] I don't believe in it for Jesus and I
[33:42] don't believe in it for me and you
[33:45] I'm not a son of Jesus that was the son
[33:47] of God
[33:51] no I
[33:53] same life for the one
[33:55] that was walking on the Earth
[34:00] to live within me
[34:02] and I must receive that
[34:07] right but yet why can't we think then by
[34:10] that way in keeping our line and our
[34:12] thought in correct order of of God
[34:14] dealing with it and knowing what he's
[34:17] going to do and what we'll do when we
[34:19] get down here
[34:24] and why can't we look to God and say
[34:26] thank you Lord
[34:28] for revealing yourself unto us
[34:33] helping us to see you
[34:36] and who you are
[34:38] I thought the prophet if God said when
[34:41] the bride realizes who she is and what
[34:44] she's here for she'll be an invincible
[34:47] Army
[34:49] that's my understanding
[34:54] well well brother so and so he he really
[34:56] makes it like that that I can see who I
[34:58] am that I was back before the world now
[35:01] what are you talking about
[35:04] all right
[35:05] what are you talking about
[35:10] your body your spirit your soul or what
[35:12] are you talking about
[35:13] what was back before the world
[35:21] the only one that I know was back before
[35:22] the world was eternal God
[35:30] that's the only way I don't know I could
[35:32] understand
[35:33] I mean if I'm wrong forgive me and
[35:35] that's just the way I believe it
[35:37] I believe there's only one Elohim
[35:40] self-existing God
[35:43] and his name is Jesus
[35:47] but it took 4 000 years
[35:51] for that one name to come into existence
[35:58] right
[36:02] and that one name was used after he was
[36:06] conceived in the womb
[36:12] in the name of Jesus
[36:15] but yet you can go all the way through
[36:16] the Old Testament and find it and
[36:18] speaking of him
[36:22] to come
[36:26] then when the prophet will say you
[36:28] always was eternal
[36:31] what's he talking about
[36:35] I mean hey we definitely know that we're
[36:39] not he wasn't talking about these bodies
[36:42] right
[36:44] they're getting older
[36:49] and our spirit within us reasons for the
[36:52] world and the things
[36:55] he said well it's got to be in that Soul
[36:57] then
[37:02] and if I was just in God's thinking
[37:07] well remember
[37:09] Judas was in his thinking
[37:15] his name was written in the Book of Life
[37:20] but where it was removed when he
[37:22] rejected Jesus Christ
[37:24] well your Prophet explains it
[37:29] Rejoice not that the devils are subject
[37:31] unto you but but your name is written in
[37:33] heaven
[37:40] the prophet of God is looking at all of
[37:42] these today
[37:45] he said Jesus told those disciples said
[37:47] I knew you before the foundation of the
[37:49] world
[37:53] now you won't find a scripture exactly
[37:55] stating it that way
[37:57] but you're getting what the prophet says
[37:59] it's stating
[38:01] Paul sums it up by saying we were chosen
[38:04] in him before the foundation of the
[38:06] world
[38:09] but now what part of us was back there
[38:11] that's that's the point I wanted to get
[38:13] to
[38:16] what part of us what part of you and I
[38:18] was before the world
[38:24] was there any part of these human
[38:26] elements that we live in back there
[38:33] well no brother Dale we was in his
[38:36] thinking
[38:37] well good then but you know Judas was
[38:40] too
[38:47] Lucifer was in his thinking
[38:51] Lucifer was in his thinking before Judas
[38:54] was ever in his thinking
[38:56] right the anointed cherub because the
[38:59] Angels were created first
[39:06] well then anything now so here's the
[39:09] point and then we'll get into something
[39:10] we want to
[39:11] keep lining up with
[39:16] any thought of anything whatsoever
[39:20] as to being back there
[39:24] outside of
[39:27] the Eternal God
[39:33] you see where we're going
[39:36] the Mormon doctrine that we were up in
[39:38] heaven running around at little peoples
[39:40] and
[39:41] yeah
[39:43] they got a lot of other doctrines too
[39:49] what was it brother dick that Jesus and
[39:51] Satan was or Lucifer was Brothers
[39:55] no a lot of things come on out
[39:58] you'd be surprised how many they are in
[39:59] the message you know when you've got two
[40:00] souls and two Lords and all kind of
[40:03] things
[40:09] but I asked a question over and over
[40:13] how does God predestinate
[40:23] then he has to have the foreknowledge
[40:26] before he predestinates
[40:33] you remember I've kept on saying to you
[40:35] I said be careful you can predestinate
[40:37] yourself out of existence
[40:41] no
[40:43] see then if predestination followers
[40:45] after foreknowledge and all you can deal
[40:47] with is predestinating
[40:49] you've done predestinated yourself out
[40:52] of existence
[40:53] because I've done backed up to
[40:55] foreknowledge which is further back than
[40:56] you're predetermining
[41:00] so you've done you've done push your
[41:02] stuff out of existence
[41:04] do you understand
[41:07] well that may be this carnal thoughts
[41:09] but that's it's true
[41:13] if all you can do is say I'm a
[41:15] predestinated seed and I believe in that
[41:18] I got the quotes laying on the desk
[41:25] but if you're a predestinated seed
[41:31] is that as far back as you can go
[41:38] asking you a simple question
[41:42] how far back can you go
[41:44] by revelation
[41:48] and we've already covered in two
[41:50] services so don't get excited about it
[41:53] that which is it wasn't for the prophet
[41:56] of God you and I could not in no way go
[41:59] back into the back part of God's mind
[42:06] and I covered it about three times in
[42:08] each service that you think you're so
[42:10] great revelated you say brother Dale you
[42:12] don't think I can get it without the
[42:14] prophet I know you can't ain't no
[42:16] thoughts
[42:19] no problem
[42:24] oh
[42:26] like I told you about the man says we're
[42:28] going to be out Beyond brother Brandon I
[42:29] said okay he's preached us to the Future
[42:31] home
[42:32] now tell me if it's the future home
[42:35] you're going to tell me tell me past
[42:38] well he packed his Dutch and left
[42:44] did he realized real quick that I didn't
[42:45] have much use for his Doctrine
[42:49] because come on if you're going to tell
[42:50] me more about
[42:58] you see you know you can't do it
[43:01] but it ain't going to convert nobody
[43:04] you're not going to convert nobody
[43:07] God is the only one that can convert
[43:08] anybody salvation is of the Lord
[43:12] Minds can be converted thoughts can be
[43:15] can be converted house changing can IC
[43:18] place we can move around and jump about
[43:20] and scream and holler all we want to
[43:22] about
[43:25] what we believe
[43:27] but a revelation changes things
[43:32] and only those who have the new birth
[43:36] can understand predestination and
[43:39] foreknowledge
[43:43] in mind if I put it a little blunt if
[43:45] you don't put it in the correct order
[43:46] what good is it
[43:49] so if all you deal with predestination
[43:51] I'm predestinated
[43:54] now quote brother Branham say the little
[43:56] woman as well she's a predestinated seat
[43:58] amen
[44:00] he said it come alive
[44:02] now did she get eternal life that day
[44:05] the only question I'm asking you
[44:09] Jesus hadn't died yet
[44:15] so what's he get
[44:16] she got a revelation of what was taking
[44:19] place or who was standing there before
[44:21] her
[44:26] she never got eternal life because Jesus
[44:28] spoke to her
[44:31] even when he breathed on them disciples
[44:34] and said receive ye the Holy Ghost the
[44:36] prophet said that was not the new birth
[44:40] he said that was a promise
[44:46] well
[44:51] but what were we back there
[44:58] so there's a time you're going to have
[45:00] to to get away from your predestinated
[45:02] form
[45:05] predetermining form or factor and it
[45:08] leads back up to foreknowledge
[45:16] because the prophet said in the Bible
[45:18] said those who he foreknew we just read
[45:22] he did predestinate
[45:26] it doesn't say those he predestinated he
[45:28] finally wound up knowing them
[45:31] you're converting the Bible to your own
[45:34] thoughts
[45:39] you see then that way I can sit here
[45:41] tonight and think you know
[45:43] you had a choice whether you wanted to
[45:45] come to church tonight or not
[45:50] you know God was looking down at that
[45:53] it's your choice
[46:00] well you don't think brother Dale I'd
[46:01] like to stay at home God reveal it to me
[46:10] nope
[46:12] don't think so
[46:16] is that blunt enough playing enough old
[46:18] Georgia ain't English
[46:21] I don't believe you can stay at home and
[46:23] eat it on your own
[46:26] or else why would it say there's a
[46:28] FireFold Ministry
[46:31] and I still haven't got to that doctor
[46:33] yet have I
[46:37] the nine spiritual gifts don't come
[46:38] predestinated eternally
[46:42] those are gifts and callings in the body
[46:44] of Christ that even a sinner can have
[46:45] them
[46:48] but the five-fold ministry comes
[46:49] predestinated eternally from God
[46:56] now thou didn't say ever preacher to
[46:58] hollers and says he's a preacher and all
[47:00] the women and all of that too you know
[47:02] that says they're a preacher that ain't
[47:04] what I'm talking about
[47:10] I'm talking about a true faithful
[47:12] Ministry
[47:16] that comes predestinated eternally amen
[47:20] amen you believe Jesus come
[47:22] predestinated eternally I do
[47:31] you see there's a lot to be said yet so
[47:33] just don't think we've run out we're
[47:35] just now getting over far enough to be
[47:37] able to talk about it
[47:39] to where we can really understand
[47:44] what is it to think about in God's
[47:46] thinking
[47:51] in God's thinking that's the title of
[47:54] the message
[47:57] what does it mean in God's thinking
[48:03] when Judas was in God's thinking
[48:07] at the same time he thought of you
[48:09] coming into the world and yeah
[48:15] he thought of Judas coming into the
[48:16] world
[48:20] what does it mean in his thinking what
[48:22] does that really mean I know I laid a
[48:25] lot on for knowledge all right and kept
[48:28] emphasizing for knowledge his knowledge
[48:30] before
[48:32] all right
[48:34] I've kept on saying that over and over
[48:36] until I hope that it's dawned on you
[48:38] that
[48:39] what that is
[48:40] foreknowledge is first
[48:43] well now in his thinking
[48:49] so there must be a dividing line in
[48:54] understanding what it means to be in his
[48:56] thinking
[48:58] are the thoughts of God
[49:01] the prophet of God said the thoughts of
[49:03] God are eternal
[49:07] now come on when he thought of judas's
[49:09] carrot
[49:11] he thought of what he would do
[49:17] when he thought of Jacob and Esau he
[49:19] thought of what they would do
[49:22] and that thought could never be changed
[49:32] there's your predestinations
[49:35] his thought was eternal about Judas is
[49:39] carrot
[49:40] but yet he couldn't make Judas be wrong
[49:44] so his thought would be of What Judas
[49:46] would wind up being himself
[49:50] and what he would desire and the
[49:52] thoughts he would go same as Jacob and
[49:54] Esau
[50:01] the thoughts of God are eternal
[50:04] if I'm never to be saved then God knew
[50:06] why I would never be saved
[50:09] and his thoughts let it be that obey and
[50:12] I can't change that well why me try
[50:15] brother Dale because I don't know that
[50:16] I'm not
[50:17] able to be saved
[50:20] what about you
[50:26] well I I believe Brother David I'm able
[50:29] to be saved because I believe the word
[50:30] all right that gives us a connecting
[50:33] line
[50:34] but it doesn't make us eternal
[50:38] but what does it mean in his thinking
[50:40] right around him used that phrase a lot
[50:44] in his thinking
[50:46] so if he was never in his thinking you
[50:49] will never be in his thinking
[50:53] what is he meaning when Judas was in his
[50:55] thinking
[50:59] so now maybe it'll don't own you about
[51:02] what 30 years that I've been saying this
[51:04] I don't want to be in God's thinking
[51:09] I want to be a part
[51:12] of his thinking
[51:14] well that's all of a sudden no it's not
[51:16] because Judas was in his thinking
[51:19] but Judas wasn't a part of God
[51:25] right
[51:27] amen so to say in his thinking
[51:30] you remember we drawed a thing and we
[51:33] covered the mind and we covered the
[51:34] thoughts of God and
[51:38] we said we got to back up now back up
[51:40] into a higher form or thinking by well
[51:43] the prophet back into the back part of
[51:45] God's mind
[51:50] and get back there and say what is it to
[51:52] think about in his thinking
[51:58] so there's a lot of difference in what
[51:59] he thought of
[52:02] and something that's a part of him
[52:09] see that way I believe
[52:11] the eternal life that you have tonight
[52:14] by the new birth
[52:16] is a part of almighty God not just him
[52:20] thinking
[52:27] not just
[52:30] to say that I'm in his mind
[52:33] Paul didn't say that Paul said let the
[52:36] mind that's in Christ
[52:38] be in you
[52:39] it'll make you a new creature
[52:44] his mind
[52:45] or he's thinking
[52:51] but to think about
[52:54] his thinking is so much beyond our
[52:57] thinking until we don't even there's no
[53:00] way to comprehend it
[53:07] but yet if we can just get away from our
[53:09] carnality
[53:11] in our doctrines
[53:13] that we've believed
[53:17] well brother Dale I just believe I
[53:19] always was eternal well now what are you
[53:21] talking about that's the only question I
[53:24] have
[53:25] well I really don't know
[53:28] but I believe it was something in me
[53:31] well why don't you believe it's a new
[53:33] birth
[53:35] because that's the only thing in you
[53:37] that can be eternal
[53:43] why not believe that God gave you
[53:45] eternal life
[53:46] he had to die to release that life that
[53:49] could come back in you amen and live in
[53:51] you
[53:52] Paul to say now it's not I that liveth
[53:55] but Christ that liveth in me and the
[53:57] life that I now live and be flesh I live
[53:58] by the Faith Of Thee Son of God Amen
[54:06] amen but if I was just in his thinking
[54:13] I don't want to be that
[54:15] in the last couple of messages now I've
[54:17] been dealing with this point
[54:25] of being a part of God
[54:35] now that's going a little bit too far
[54:40] now brother Dale I think we can be Sons
[54:44] and Daughters of God
[54:46] by the new birth
[54:49] but I don't think we can be part of God
[54:53] I don't think your cranium cap is
[54:55] working
[54:58] your brain
[55:04] see you're trying to be a son of
[55:05] somebody else instead of being God made
[55:07] manifest in human flesh
[55:11] now it's not just too much now that's
[55:12] too much now that's now I don't like
[55:14] that because you're saying it's your God
[55:17] no I'm saying What God Says
[55:25] Paul said on Mars Hill
[55:28] where his offspring
[55:37] well now are you a son of somebody
[55:40] that's a son of God
[55:44] and remember Jesus Christ never
[55:50] come
[55:52] to
[55:54] what is the quote from the prophet I'm
[55:55] trying to get into mine
[56:00] he come to bring us to eternal life
[56:04] he never came to bring your inheritance
[56:08] your inheritance is eternal life before
[56:10] the world but he come to make a way to
[56:13] receive that inheritance
[56:19] he never died to just say give you
[56:22] eternal life
[56:26] he died that everybody could receive
[56:29] eternal life
[56:34] but yet God knowing who would and who
[56:36] wouldn't
[56:38] what is it
[56:45] what does it mean then to be in the mind
[56:48] of God or in his thinking
[56:51] or to be a thought of God
[56:57] there's a vast difference
[57:00] in what you think of
[57:03] and your real thoughts
[57:07] I tried to explain that the other day so
[57:09] come on will you get it
[57:12] you can sit there right now and thank
[57:14] all kind of dirty thoughts you want to
[57:17] is that a part of you
[57:22] come on Satan put some in your mind you
[57:25] put them in the mind of Jesus
[57:34] but see I want to be a part of that one
[57:36] that was doing the thinking
[57:41] you went too far now because you're
[57:44] you're trying to say that we're God
[57:46] what are you
[57:52] what I want an answer from you what
[57:55] I oh we're the sons of God
[57:59] sons of God
[58:03] I'm not going too far in that because I
[58:05] got the message the notes are laying
[58:06] back there
[58:08] do you believe in eternal sonship
[58:21] I believe in eternal godship
[58:28] what do you believe
[58:32] in other words what do you mean what
[58:34] Jesus Christ come and saved you he died
[58:36] for you have to admit that right
[58:38] man I mean you got to say we got eternal
[58:40] life by Jesus Christ come and paying the
[58:42] price and then the Holy Ghost could come
[58:43] to give us eternal life okay
[58:49] does that make you
[58:53] the terminologies and form of the words
[58:56] we call son
[59:00] when a son has a beginning
[59:08] right
[59:10] John's our beginning
[59:13] I thought Eternal had no beginning
[59:16] do we really understand the godhead
[59:22] you know that random said he believed an
[59:24] eternal godhead
[59:37] do we believe in eternal sonship
[59:40] no no no no we don't believe in that now
[59:43] well then
[59:45] if you don't believe in Eternal sonship
[59:47] then Jesus must have been God
[59:50] made manifest in flesh
[59:54] call the son right right but there's no
[59:58] scripture where it calls him God the
[59:59] Father God the son
[1:00:02] and God the Holy Ghost that's that's one
[1:00:04] of our favorites ain't it there's no
[1:00:06] scripture for that save you time going
[1:00:07] home and looking it up
[1:00:10] it'll say son of God
[1:00:14] but not God the son because there's no
[1:00:16] such words
[1:00:21] see if you have eternal life dwelling in
[1:00:24] you who are you
[1:00:34] yeah but that's just a little bit too
[1:00:35] far now because you're just putting us
[1:00:38] out there a little bit too far now
[1:00:39] brother tell you be careful
[1:00:43] oh yeah
[1:00:44] I've been 40 something years being
[1:00:46] careful
[1:00:47] because I believe just 40 something
[1:00:49] years ago and preached it 40 something
[1:00:50] years ago
[1:00:53] and I still believe it
[1:00:55] I believe a child of God is God made
[1:00:58] manifest
[1:01:00] in the human vessel
[1:01:02] the only difference
[1:01:05] was that he came into the world Body
[1:01:09] Spirit and soul the body of creation of
[1:01:12] God the spirit Eternal God himself and
[1:01:16] the soul of almighty God living in that
[1:01:18] body
[1:01:20] that you and I come into the world lost
[1:01:22] and doomed and on our way to Hell Body
[1:01:24] Spirit and soul lost amen amen and
[1:01:27] received eternal life by the new birth
[1:01:30] now we are The Offspring of God
[1:01:37] dwelling in a body but still have a
[1:01:39] spirit and a body that's messed up right
[1:01:42] right but yet in that Soul we have
[1:01:44] eternal life
[1:01:49] that eternal life has always been
[1:01:51] eternal life
[1:01:54] eternal life doesn't have a beginning
[1:01:58] so what are we
[1:02:03] just get a couple of quotes because I
[1:02:04] know England but far but we'll continue
[1:02:06] this Sunday because I'm just trying to
[1:02:08] get one point to our mind one thing
[1:02:11] that's why I keep going over it and over
[1:02:13] and I'll keep on
[1:02:15] if you get bored over me repeating
[1:02:17] myself and doing it you just
[1:02:19] lay out a few weeks and come every once
[1:02:21] in a while you'll catch back up
[1:02:24] I'm not sarcastic I'm just telling you
[1:02:26] that's if that's the way you think
[1:02:31] but you see Church the only way you can
[1:02:34] go back any further than a predestinated
[1:02:38] form
[1:02:41] is to back up into God's Mind by way of
[1:02:44] a prophet's message
[1:02:46] and let God speak to you and I and tell
[1:02:49] us the secrets just like we know and
[1:02:53] believe what happened into Genesis
[1:02:55] because Moses went back into the back
[1:02:58] part of God's mind and got from God what
[1:03:02] happened in the garden
[1:03:05] I don't think Moses sitting with you
[1:03:07] well I'm going to write this down but I
[1:03:09] don't know they ate an apple well of
[1:03:12] course we know he didn't write it that
[1:03:13] way but
[1:03:15] that's what we think he didn't know
[1:03:16] what's going on
[1:03:20] when I first heard that Prophet it
[1:03:21] wouldn't long after beginning the
[1:03:23] message I believe one thing about
[1:03:24] serpency I believe them all Pharisees
[1:03:27] they knew what happened in the guard
[1:03:31] because they told Jesus we wasn't born
[1:03:34] like you
[1:03:38] we weren't born that way
[1:03:42] we have a pure lineage
[1:03:45] and we have circumcision to prove it
[1:03:52] they believe circumcision done away with
[1:03:54] a the sex part of the garden that's what
[1:03:57] I believe
[1:03:58] whether that's right or not that's all
[1:04:00] right that's just what I believe so it
[1:04:02] ain't costing you nothing
[1:04:04] but listen
[1:04:08] to back up into his thinking
[1:04:12] as to not be just something he thought
[1:04:15] of now we'll get to it Lord when
[1:04:17] probably Sunday we're in job where the
[1:04:19] Morning Star saying together the Son of
[1:04:21] God shouted for Joy see that's got to be
[1:04:23] placed in the correct place because if
[1:04:25] not then you you've got a problem
[1:04:30] all right
[1:04:35] we're Spirits back to our brother random
[1:04:37] questions and answers in 59.
[1:04:40] paragraph 167. no
[1:04:45] we were not even nothing then
[1:04:53] we were only figurative
[1:04:56] in his mind
[1:04:58] how many times we read that over and
[1:05:00] over and over
[1:05:03] only figurative in his mind
[1:05:07] were we Spirits no we wasn't nothing
[1:05:13] but in God's mind we were
[1:05:17] and he spoke it and it materialized
[1:05:21] and Jesus was slain how many knows that
[1:05:23] Jesus was slain for the foundation word
[1:05:25] right
[1:05:27] but were we spirits
[1:05:29] no
[1:05:32] were we people back there no
[1:05:41] in his thinking
[1:05:45] do you get the difference of what that
[1:05:47] you can sit there and think about
[1:05:49] something that is not even a part of you
[1:05:51] and will never transpire
[1:05:54] right right
[1:05:55] but there's no way God could think of
[1:05:57] anything that it's not transpiring
[1:06:06] come on is that what the prophet said it
[1:06:07] he said he can't have a new thought
[1:06:17] you see in his mind
[1:06:20] so I don't want to be just what he
[1:06:22] thought of
[1:06:28] the only way that you can have eternal
[1:06:30] life
[1:06:32] is to not just be what God thought of
[1:06:35] but to be a part of the god that done
[1:06:37] the thinking
[1:06:39] do you understand me
[1:06:42] how could you get eternal life without
[1:06:44] Jesus Christ giving it unto us
[1:06:50] well it always was eternal brother you
[1:06:52] just don't understand now you went too
[1:06:54] far
[1:06:57] yeah it will let me brother Dale better
[1:06:59] you better be careful called Satan
[1:07:02] wants to be God
[1:07:08] yeah and that's what he's giving the
[1:07:09] people the idea to try to be God in the
[1:07:11] wrong way
[1:07:16] but aren't you careful because you might
[1:07:18] be Satan might be dealing with you
[1:07:22] don't worry about it he's dealing with
[1:07:23] me all the time
[1:07:24] that's no problem to tell you that he
[1:07:26] deals with me all the time
[1:07:29] and I'm going to tell you that you're
[1:07:30] just a liar when you say don't deal with
[1:07:32] you
[1:07:35] no problem
[1:07:37] because I know what he does to the human
[1:07:39] being
[1:07:42] but if I can follow the channel of God
[1:07:46] what is it to one thing brought around
[1:07:48] said Satan can't do
[1:07:50] I know he can't be the Holy Ghost that's
[1:07:52] but what is the one thing run around
[1:07:54] said Satan can't do
[1:07:56] it okay we can't create that's another
[1:07:58] what's the other the main thing he says
[1:08:00] Satan can't do
[1:08:02] he can't put the word together
[1:08:06] but
[1:08:10] he'll stop somewhere every time make
[1:08:13] these
[1:08:14] stones in the bread
[1:08:20] he cannot put the word together
[1:08:24] well how do we find a predestinated gift
[1:08:31] one of these days I'll have to get into
[1:08:32] that anyway so don't worry about it
[1:08:36] what is a predestinated gift
[1:08:39] that's predestinated eternally
[1:08:45] how do you keep up with a prophet
[1:08:48] to decide whether he's a prophet or not
[1:08:53] all right how do you keep up with a true
[1:08:55] fault Ministry
[1:09:02] right
[1:09:04] but what they can do with the word
[1:09:07] they can keep that word together you
[1:09:09] better listen
[1:09:12] well I don't like you do that because
[1:09:13] you get into your own self listen
[1:09:16] don't you worry about yourself you just
[1:09:18] worry about whether I'm telling you the
[1:09:20] truth or not because a dumb donkey can
[1:09:22] tell you the truth I can die and go to
[1:09:24] hell but you know the way I feel now I
[1:09:26] can be so happy because I've been able
[1:09:28] to preach 40 something years about God
[1:09:30] and his ways and his doings
[1:09:33] and showing how that he's the Eternal
[1:09:35] God
[1:09:36] and bringing it down through and showing
[1:09:38] it to the correct order
[1:09:40] they don't have to deny any quote the
[1:09:42] prophet bro or any Scripture
[1:09:47] over that 40 something years I've
[1:09:49] probably put every scripture ever quote
[1:09:51] together somewhere I didn't mean that as
[1:09:53] me it's not me
[1:09:58] we better get away from these things
[1:10:00] that we think we are
[1:10:04] remember it is he that hath made us and
[1:10:06] not we ourselves
[1:10:08] if we are anything whatsoever God made
[1:10:10] us that
[1:10:12] amen it's not my choosing
[1:10:18] you want to swap places sometimes with
[1:10:20] me
[1:10:24] get into a place that I can't even pray
[1:10:32] you ain't never been that away
[1:10:37] that you really couldn't even pray
[1:10:43] all you can do is just say Lord
[1:10:46] I just give it all to you
[1:10:51] you'll take care of it
[1:10:53] because I can't do it anyway
[1:10:58] but we wouldn't spirits
[1:11:03] we were just in his thinking
[1:11:08] in his thinking
[1:11:11] to really be in his thinking in the
[1:11:13] correct way then we have to be a part of
[1:11:15] him
[1:11:19] now we know then the only thing that's a
[1:11:21] part of him is eternal life
[1:11:24] now what we what we got to decide is one
[1:11:26] thing
[1:11:27] you say decide well that's
[1:11:29] come on that's where I'm laying it down
[1:11:31] that hard to make it where you got to
[1:11:32] decide one thing
[1:11:34] you got to decide that the prophet and
[1:11:37] the Bible is right
[1:11:40] mm-hmm okay amen r
[1:11:46] people with their own ideas about what
[1:11:48] they're doing is right
[1:11:52] so it's left up to you whether you got
[1:11:54] the holy ghost or not right
[1:11:56] how are you going to check me
[1:12:00] come on I've been at this 40 years I
[1:12:02] ain't worried about it
[1:12:03] you got to check me by the word
[1:12:07] you can't check me by how good feelings
[1:12:09] I am
[1:12:13] or how nice a guy I am
[1:12:19] Jesus didn't seem too good when that
[1:12:21] lady sure was pleading on him and he
[1:12:23] said well you're nothing but a dog
[1:12:28] we don't give the children's bread to
[1:12:29] dogs
[1:12:31] I mean was he smiling
[1:12:35] you don't you don't understand
[1:12:36] sweetheart
[1:12:38] no he spoke plain straight
[1:12:42] because that's the best way to do it
[1:12:44] but in his thinking
[1:12:46] and to think about that he never had a
[1:12:48] new thought
[1:12:49] so if he never had a new thought the
[1:12:51] thoughts of God are eternal
[1:12:58] right is that somewhere in church age
[1:13:00] that we gave to you about three or four
[1:13:02] times
[1:13:04] so then we have to be the only way we
[1:13:06] can be in this thinking correctly is to
[1:13:08] be a part of him
[1:13:16] why wouldn't we want it that away
[1:13:22] why would we not want to depend upon him
[1:13:25] for everything
[1:13:31] and realize the breath we breathe
[1:13:34] the food we eat who is it
[1:13:37] um Jackson which one was it Stonewall
[1:13:40] Jackson said that he never even took a
[1:13:42] drink of water without thanking God for
[1:13:44] it
[1:13:45] we ought to do that every breath we take
[1:13:53] everything we get he's given us and then
[1:13:56] we don't want to depend on him to be
[1:13:58] what he wants to be as our savior Our
[1:14:00] Father our healer
[1:14:07] what about it
[1:14:10] God is the only thing that's eternal
[1:14:13] pull that one up number four
[1:14:16] five identifications of the true church
[1:14:18] 1960 9 11 evening service God is the
[1:14:22] only thing that's Eternal therefore we
[1:14:24] are part of God
[1:14:27] by receiving his life
[1:14:31] Jesus said I give unto them eternal life
[1:14:34] the Greek word there is Zoe means God's
[1:14:37] own life the only way that you can ever
[1:14:40] live again is to have eternal life
[1:14:43] which is God's life because your life
[1:14:46] will perish but his life will be raised
[1:14:49] up again because God is eternal
[1:14:52] you and you've got eternal life and can
[1:14:55] no more die than God can die oh he that
[1:14:58] believeth on me have eternal life and
[1:15:00] I'll raise him up
[1:15:02] eternal life
[1:15:04] number five
[1:15:07] water baptism
[1:15:10] 1961.
[1:15:11] 119 a
[1:15:15] that's the reason we can't die right
[1:15:17] down at the bottom
[1:15:19] because we're a part of God
[1:15:23] offsprings of his
[1:15:26] sons and daughters
[1:15:29] we got eternal life
[1:15:32] God's life it never did begin never will
[1:15:35] end right
[1:15:37] paradox 64.
[1:15:42] God in the beginning is the word
[1:15:47] now if you listen to this quote
[1:15:49] you'll realize one scripture
[1:15:52] and that's one back over in the name
[1:15:55] that I wanted to bring out
[1:15:57] but you remember when he comes riding
[1:15:59] back on a white horse
[1:16:02] he has a name written
[1:16:05] and what does it say which is the word
[1:16:07] of God
[1:16:14] he has a name written
[1:16:16] God in the beginning is the word he
[1:16:18] always was the word and the word is a
[1:16:21] thought that's expressed see now in his
[1:16:23] thinking what he had the whole plan
[1:16:26] knowing to end from the beginning he has
[1:16:28] just expressed it in words
[1:16:30] and those words are manifested
[1:16:34] what about it
[1:16:37] sir as we would see Jesus 64. paragraph
[1:16:40] 13 14.
[1:16:42] now if you were in his thinking at the
[1:16:46] beginning
[1:16:47] if you got eternal life there is only
[1:16:50] one form of eternal life
[1:16:52] eternal life had no beginning and it has
[1:16:54] no ending
[1:16:55] so if you have eternal life you were an
[1:16:58] attribute of God's thinking before there
[1:17:00] was anything but him
[1:17:03] attribute of his thinking
[1:17:08] Judas is carrot
[1:17:12] was a natural thought of his thinking
[1:17:16] but he was not an attribute of God
[1:17:22] we've been through that a lot now I hope
[1:17:24] you
[1:17:25] you might have to go back and
[1:17:27] listen a little
[1:17:29] attributes of his thinking
[1:17:32] now I'm not talking about attributes of
[1:17:34] his thinking like Judas is just a
[1:17:36] thought I'm talking about attributes of
[1:17:38] being a part of the Thinker
[1:17:41] right
[1:17:47] you were an attribute of God's thinking
[1:17:49] before there was anything but him your
[1:17:51] form your shape and what you're in now
[1:17:54] is just a negative
[1:17:58] when you come up to around 20 22 years
[1:18:01] old
[1:18:01] you were a negative and death develops a
[1:18:04] picture to the positive
[1:18:05] yeah
[1:18:07] all right
[1:18:11] look how he places it as
[1:18:14] he's thinking of what would take place
[1:18:17] here
[1:18:19] and watch the seed then
[1:18:22] is this thought is this quote has been
[1:18:25] read you say a seed
[1:18:27] remember
[1:18:30] Gene
[1:18:35] come on
[1:18:37] you were not a seed in your great in
[1:18:41] your great granddaddy
[1:18:43] you had to be only from your daddy
[1:18:47] but in your great-granddaddy you could
[1:18:49] not be a seed
[1:18:54] you were a gene
[1:18:56] and even in your daddy
[1:18:59] when he was born you were just a gene
[1:19:07] and then somewhere in his 20s when he
[1:19:10] got married and
[1:19:12] you understand
[1:19:15] now you can talk about a germ or a gene
[1:19:18] or a seed
[1:19:22] we were a gene in God we had that this
[1:19:24] past Sunday
[1:19:28] it wasn't a germ or a word or a seed or
[1:19:31] whatever as being literal things
[1:19:34] we were a gene in his thinking
[1:19:39] look what he says here because this
[1:19:40] covers time I love this when their eyes
[1:19:43] were opened they knew him 64.
[1:19:46] as I said last evening God has lauded
[1:19:49] that his scripture from the beginning
[1:19:51] before there was any time when he was
[1:19:54] eternal he all he is the Eternal one and
[1:19:59] these things that's happening now are
[1:20:02] only the attributes of God's thinking
[1:20:05] at first it has to be a thought and then
[1:20:08] a word and a word when a thought
[1:20:10] expressed is a word and then it's spoken
[1:20:13] it has to happen and the whole thing is
[1:20:15] God unfolding himself in his attributes
[1:20:19] then God being made manifest tangible
[1:20:23] tangible that we can talk
[1:20:26] to speak with his whole church body and
[1:20:30] everything
[1:20:31] Therefore your name was in his thinking
[1:20:38] that's how you have eternal life
[1:20:43] you can't have it no other way
[1:20:46] now you're reading off the screen
[1:20:50] you can't have it no other way
[1:20:53] only to be what
[1:20:55] your name was in his thinking
[1:20:59] what
[1:21:00] you can't have it no other way if you've
[1:21:02] got eternal life
[1:21:04] you always was
[1:21:08] what about what always would and if you
[1:21:10] otherwise you can't say well
[1:21:12] say well
[1:21:15] what about it
[1:21:21] there's a vast difference in being what
[1:21:23] he thought of
[1:21:24] into being a part of him
[1:21:32] if you want to deal with predestination
[1:21:35] I still don't want to just be a point
[1:21:38] that would think about predetermining
[1:21:40] I'd still rather be part of the one that
[1:21:42] done the predetermining
[1:21:45] you know
[1:21:47] because that way I don't I can't fail
[1:21:52] because he could predestinate me to fall
[1:21:57] but if I'm a part of him sister Gayle
[1:21:59] how can I fall
[1:22:01] now then we know it's not Body Spirit
[1:22:03] and soul of a human being
[1:22:07] the only part that always was eternal in
[1:22:10] his own life amen
[1:22:15] and having that life coming in you and I
[1:22:29] you always was
[1:22:31] Eugene is thinking
[1:22:35] let's just quit Tara cousin
[1:22:38] got a bunch more quotes but let me just
[1:22:40] talk a minute
[1:22:45] eternal life to me means more than
[1:22:48] anything in the world
[1:22:50] because it means whether or not I live
[1:22:52] because we don't believe in eternal hell
[1:22:54] right
[1:22:56] so if you don't believe in eternal hell
[1:23:00] uh
[1:23:01] there is no other eternal life
[1:23:05] beside the life of almighty God
[1:23:10] and why wouldn't we want to believe and
[1:23:11] teach our children
[1:23:14] what if your children sets in a church
[1:23:16] that's all they hear is we always was
[1:23:18] eternal you don't need to be saved you
[1:23:20] always was eternal you always was
[1:23:22] eternal everything you always was
[1:23:24] eternal well they're not going to seek
[1:23:26] God
[1:23:29] right
[1:23:34] you see why I apologize to a man one
[1:23:36] time for what I've taught in his church
[1:23:39] that he didn't believe I told him I said
[1:23:41] I will not apologize for what I was
[1:23:43] saying I apologize for the fact that you
[1:23:46] don't believe it
[1:23:47] and I said in your church I said
[1:23:52] I want to be right see and I just I said
[1:23:54] I'm sorry and I said something I caught
[1:23:56] you I thought you believed in eternal
[1:23:58] life
[1:24:00] and I said I'll never apologize for
[1:24:01] getting your people to seek God
[1:24:07] yes but no man sought the Lord he'll run
[1:24:10] me down one of these days well
[1:24:16] he might run you over too
[1:24:24] what do we think about in his thinking
[1:24:29] didn't even get into the quote parts of
[1:24:31] it but in his thinking
[1:24:38] then if there's any part of me
[1:24:40] whatsoever
[1:24:43] that tries to think about
[1:24:47] how great I am
[1:24:50] I realized that I was lost
[1:24:58] I realized that I was doomed and on the
[1:25:00] way to hell
[1:25:04] God crossed my path when I was about 11
[1:25:06] years old I told you about that
[1:25:09] 'd give most people a joyous thought so
[1:25:12] that eternal life found you right back
[1:25:14] there
[1:25:15] I never did believe that gave me eternal
[1:25:18] life
[1:25:20] and even when I heard the prophet and
[1:25:22] him explaining it
[1:25:24] he was explaining to God I saw but
[1:25:29] he didn't tell me that to just believe
[1:25:31] that I was eternal
[1:25:38] and for two years I sought God for the
[1:25:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:48] until I had a satisfaction of knowing
[1:25:51] what eternal life is
[1:25:55] I never thought that I always was
[1:25:57] eternal never have had no thoughts
[1:26:00] there's only one part of this man
[1:26:02] that you're looking at that's Eternal
[1:26:04] and that's the soul that God has given
[1:26:07] eternal life to
[1:26:12] him but that eternal life is a part of
[1:26:14] God
[1:26:16] and that didn't make it we'll get on it
[1:26:18] Sunday that didn't make me an eternal
[1:26:20] son
[1:26:25] there is no such thing
[1:26:29] as an eternal son
[1:26:32] a Son of God is eternal
[1:26:35] by the new birth but there's no such
[1:26:37] thing as a Son of God as an eternal Son
[1:26:40] of God
[1:26:46] you see why I try my best to hold
[1:26:48] salvation before you
[1:26:50] to get you to seek God
[1:26:54] until you come through with an
[1:26:56] experience that you can
[1:26:59] be assured of where you're standing
[1:27:05] believe in Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] come to live into your heart and your
[1:27:09] life by the new birth
[1:27:12] then that eternal life always was
[1:27:16] eternal amen
[1:27:23] there was a day that you and I
[1:27:30] never existed as people
[1:27:34] if you're following what I say and what
[1:27:37] I've talked to you so far in a couple of
[1:27:39] likes a couple of messages that we've
[1:27:41] got back up into the mind of God
[1:27:44] the only thing that can be in the mind
[1:27:46] of God is a part of God
[1:27:53] that's eternal life
[1:27:57] a part of God
[1:27:59] manifested in a human being
[1:28:07] a child of God a son and daughter of a
[1:28:10] living God
[1:28:14] just like you are The Offspring of your
[1:28:17] mom and dad
[1:28:24] you are them on display
[1:28:26] in another form
[1:28:33] we as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're
[1:28:36] God on display
[1:28:38] in another form
[1:28:40] called a bride
[1:28:44] no Eternal sonships to it
[1:28:49] but an eternal godship
[1:28:56] you said brother Dale do you really
[1:28:57] believe that we are
[1:29:00] God made manifest in human flesh
[1:29:04] will you explain what you are
[1:29:09] Sunday morning you got to service
[1:29:11] men women children who you want
[1:29:14] you can explain what you are
[1:29:23] but see I can't explain anything but
[1:29:25] what this word says
[1:29:27] this word says I was lost
[1:29:33] Paul said such were some of you
[1:29:38] we were lost
[1:29:40] God crossed our faith
[1:29:45] made contact with us
[1:29:47] brother moat used to call it a little
[1:29:49] tug on your heart
[1:29:51] it was a good talk
[1:29:53] God just reaches down and touches you
[1:29:58] amen can you have eternal life brother
[1:30:00] Dale and doubt it
[1:30:06] may I quote right around him
[1:30:09] his daughter-in-law Lois
[1:30:12] received the Holy Ghost one night
[1:30:15] to read the message you'll find it
[1:30:18] the next night or two she was doubting
[1:30:19] whether she was saved or not
[1:30:29] Satan can come in and make you think a
[1:30:31] lot of things
[1:30:34] but just keep quoting the word to him
[1:30:40] Stan come on brothers
[1:30:42] in God's thinking or in the mind of God
[1:30:45] or whatever
[1:30:48] just to be a part of God
[1:30:52] displayed in the human vessel
[1:30:58] but one day
[1:31:00] you say well what are we going to be in
[1:31:02] heaven
[1:31:04] I'm glad you thought of that
[1:31:07] what are we going to be in heaven is it
[1:31:08] going to do away with God
[1:31:11] and it's just the people running around
[1:31:14] not quite
[1:31:17] not quite
[1:31:20] because you see I'd love today to have
[1:31:22] my father sitting here listening to me
[1:31:24] preach
[1:31:30] because he's my father
[1:31:34] like I told a man at work one time he
[1:31:36] was talking about how bad his daddy was
[1:31:38] I said yeah but just remember one thing
[1:31:42] he brought you into the world
[1:31:46] no matter what you think
[1:31:49] about him brother Donnie knows this is
[1:31:52] true
[1:31:53] we were talking one day and he's talking
[1:31:55] about his dad and how sometimes he was
[1:31:57] pretty tough
[1:31:59] you know boxing with him and
[1:32:02] you know I said but brother Donnie
[1:32:06] he brought you into the world
[1:32:12] and he made you a man
[1:32:15] to not be pushed around
[1:32:19] he made you straight and firm
[1:32:23] might not have been a good daddy as we
[1:32:25] think but if nothing else he brought you
[1:32:28] into the world
[1:32:29] you know it's what I think about kids
[1:32:31] now they say you brought me into the
[1:32:33] world you're responsible well let's just
[1:32:36] take them out
[1:32:39] no no not that far now
[1:32:42] they only want you to raise them in
[1:32:44] responsibility and give them everything
[1:32:51] as you see folks
[1:32:54] I never knew my daddy
[1:33:00] never got to see a medium as far as
[1:33:02] human beings I can remember vague things
[1:33:07] but you know
[1:33:08] as I told you Sunday about what would
[1:33:10] you do if somebody offered you a million
[1:33:12] dollars to change your birth certificate
[1:33:14] over and come somebody else I'll never
[1:33:16] change from being a Dale I don't care
[1:33:17] what
[1:33:20] because my daddy was a Dale
[1:33:22] he said well how do you know well
[1:33:24] even if I wouldn't that was the guy
[1:33:27] that was put forth as being my daddy
[1:33:31] and I loved him for that
[1:33:35] your daddy and they've been in mean as a
[1:33:38] rattlesnake
[1:33:41] but he brought you into the world
[1:33:48] because you see I'm talking about my
[1:33:49] heavenly father
[1:33:54] my father
[1:33:57] that give me part of his own life
[1:34:02] that I could be his child
[1:34:06] now I'm going to stay at this way and
[1:34:07] then we'll stop on it see I don't
[1:34:09] believe in eternal sonship
[1:34:12] but I believe a child of God that has
[1:34:14] eternal life
[1:34:15] is just as Eternal as his father
[1:34:21] so you can say I'm an eternal child
[1:34:22] that's good
[1:34:24] that gives ring to a lot of things to be
[1:34:26] an eternal child
[1:34:33] what we got brother 6 12 in spiral book
[1:34:36] as a dear parents
