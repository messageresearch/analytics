[30:17] now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and
[30:19] Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[30:22] should be fellow Heirs of the same body
[30:24] and partakers of his promise in Christ
[30:26] by the gospel whereof I Was Made of
[30:29] Minister according to the gift of the
[30:31] grace of God given unto me by the
[30:33] effectual working of his power
[30:36] and and to me who I am less than the
[30:39] least of all the saints is the grace
[30:40] given that I should preach among the
[30:42] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[30:44] Christ and to make known
[30:47] and to make all men see what is the
[30:49] Fellowship of the mystery which from the
[30:50] beginning of the world
[30:52] hath been hid in God who created All
[30:55] Things by Jesus Christ to the intent
[30:57] that now upon
[30:59] now to the principalities and powers in
[31:01] Heavenly places might be known by the
[31:03] church the manifold wisdom of God
[31:05] according to the Eternal purpose which
[31:08] he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in
[31:10] whom we have boldness and access with
[31:13] confidence By The Grace by the faith of
[31:15] him wherefore I desire that you faint
[31:18] not at my tribulation for you which is
[31:21] For Your Glory
[31:22] amen so
[31:25] speaking of here
[31:27] Paul speaking talking about the
[31:29] effectual working of his power and it's
[31:32] interesting you know Paul's speaking to
[31:33] the Ephesians and he's and he begins to
[31:35] talk about the mystery and and
[31:37] understanding what his commission was
[31:40] was to preach the mystery of Jesus
[31:43] Christ to the Gentiles and and it's so
[31:45] amazing that to read what he was talking
[31:47] about how all Through the Ages nobody
[31:50] saw these things but it come to this
[31:51] time and God began to make himself known
[31:54] and explain to the Gentiles that they
[31:55] should be fellow Heirs of the of the
[31:58] promise of God and know who we are and
[32:00] know what God has called us to and begin
[32:02] to break these things down and the
[32:04] apostles Paul standing there and you can
[32:05] imagine
[32:06] seeing these things and understanding
[32:08] all of the prophets and all the ones
[32:10] down through down through history all
[32:12] the ones that God spoke to and began to
[32:14] reveal himself to but he never revealed
[32:16] himself the way he did to Paul began to
[32:18] speak and to the Gentiles for us to
[32:20] understand who we are and what God the
[32:23] prom the plan of God the promise of God
[32:25] all the way down through time what God
[32:27] brought to us all the things that took
[32:30] place came down to our day this is for
[32:33] us and Paul begins to speak of that and
[32:35] when he began to understand that he
[32:36] stood there and said I'm the least of
[32:38] All Saints
[32:40] to understand the position that he was
[32:42] in and know where he came from and know
[32:43] what kind of life that he lived now you
[32:45] could you know as as far as a man he
[32:47] could stand there and you couldn't put a
[32:48] finger on his life because he lived such
[32:50] a holy righteous life according to the
[32:52] law but knowing what he done to the
[32:54] Christians because when God had when he
[32:56] had an experience with God and began to
[32:58] understand all those people that he
[33:00] prosecuted and persecuted and he allowed
[33:02] to be put to death all of that was Jesus
[33:04] Christ in flesh in front of him and he
[33:06] didn't realize what he was doing and you
[33:09] know as he stood there and he said he
[33:11] was a blasphemer but but he did he done
[33:13] all those things
[33:14] I without you know in ignorance and and
[33:17] all these things that he begins to talk
[33:18] about and what I'm what amazing thing
[33:20] that Paul oh great man that Paul was and
[33:22] but he began to understand how you know
[33:25] because brother Brown said you know you
[33:27] don't Revelation doesn't puff you up it
[33:29] doesn't raise you up but it makes you
[33:30] humble the more that God begins to
[33:33] reveal to you you become humble and here
[33:34] he is he was the least of all of them
[33:36] the grace that God because when he
[33:39] looked at the life that he was that he
[33:40] lived and What kind of person he was the
[33:43] amount of fold Grace that was presented
[33:45] to Paul in his life that God gave him
[33:47] the Revelation to bring to the Gentiles
[33:49] to make known all these scriptures and
[33:51] all these things that was made known in
[33:53] our day and he began to speak of this
[33:55] and what a great man but he understood
[33:57] wow what a what a great thing but what a
[34:00] what a humbling experience it was what
[34:03] an awesome ex awesome responsibility
[34:06] that he was given but he said I was
[34:08] given this to preach the unsearchable
[34:10] riches of Christ to the Gentiles and
[34:13] what a great man and to where are the
[34:15] beneficiaries of the great work that the
[34:17] Apostle Paul done and and laying out the
[34:20] scripture and all these things that's
[34:21] been and each one of them had to do
[34:23] their own part but you know it took it
[34:25] was the power of God in his life that
[34:27] that he began to do these things and you
[34:30] know what we we look many times and we
[34:31] think about the the power that God has
[34:34] the power of God brother random said you
[34:36] know there's only two powers that we
[34:38] that are out in the world there's only
[34:40] two powers and he said one of them is
[34:42] the Holy Ghost and he said the other one
[34:44] is intellectual powers and you know
[34:46] that's the one that the devil wants to
[34:48] work through he wants to work through
[34:49] intellect he wants to work through your
[34:51] mind he wants to pervert what God has
[34:54] said because that's the only that's the
[34:55] only Avenue that he has and the only
[34:57] Avenue that Satan ever has is what you
[35:00] allow him to have he's he's Bound by
[35:03] your by your confession by your
[35:05] profession by by your testimony your you
[35:09] bound him
[35:10] he's only allowed because he's only
[35:12] because see brother rap said that's
[35:14] exactly what took place in the Garden of
[35:16] Eden he had intellectual powers and he
[35:18] came to Eve in the Garden of Eden began
[35:21] to speak to her on the word and when he
[35:23] got her off of the off of the behind
[35:25] from behind the word he got her off the
[35:27] foundation that she was planted on when
[35:29] she got off of the foundation of the
[35:31] word then he could talk to her and could
[35:33] convince her or what was what was not
[35:36] right but she began to believe in that
[35:38] and not only did she believe that but
[35:39] she began to walk in that and then all
[35:42] of a sudden you know because when it
[35:44] became into the womb of her mind that
[35:46] that was true what Satan had told her
[35:48] what the serpent told her was true that
[35:51] you're going to bring children this way
[35:53] and how all these all this is going to
[35:54] be so great I'm going to I'm coming to
[35:56] this great thing look what I'm going to
[35:57] do for God and not realizing God had
[36:00] already told her listen you stay in
[36:02] there you wait on God there's a place
[36:04] for you to come to and you wait on God
[36:06] and he's going to bring you to that
[36:08] place
[36:09] but because you know when God began to
[36:11] speak to Adam and Eve in the garden you
[36:13] know what the serpent wasn't there Satan
[36:15] wasn't there he didn't you know what
[36:17] because when he began to speak to him
[36:19] that wasn't that wasn't it had nothing
[36:20] to do with any of that
[36:23] but then all of a sudden I I got I gotta
[36:26] I gotta I got something to tell you
[36:29] well you know what God was the one that
[36:31] was doing the speaking
[36:33] and it was just Adam and Eve and God
[36:36] that was that was the Oneness and now
[36:38] and then all of a sudden I got well you
[36:40] know well you know you know that the
[36:41] devil is is telling you the truth when
[36:43] he's talking
[36:46] because he's got you know you know just
[36:48] just like when brother man I'm talking
[36:49] about when Satan come to him when he
[36:51] when Sharon Rose and and sister uh hope
[36:54] passed you know when he began to speak
[36:56] to him about what was taking place you
[36:59] know he had it that was that was his
[37:00] inroad
[37:05] just like he told
[37:07] just like he told Eve
[37:10] well what we know we know the Lord said
[37:12] that you shouldn't touch this over here
[37:15] this this is not that's not something
[37:16] you should touch but let me tell you
[37:19] I got an inside track
[37:21] I got a tip for you
[37:25] and as soon and and so you're just like
[37:27] brother Brandon out there you know you
[37:28] said he was a Healer you said he was a
[37:30] good God
[37:32] but you know what your baby's dying your
[37:35] wife's dying
[37:37] and you pray and you pray and you know
[37:39] what he's turned his back on you
[37:42] and he was standing there saying you
[37:44] know I was about ready to agree with him
[37:47] but you know what he said that he said
[37:50] the spirit could come to him and he
[37:52] remembered the word the Lord gives and
[37:55] the Lord takes away
[37:57] hey you know what it wasn't it wasn't
[37:59] mine to begin with
[38:01] it was it was because it God gave it to
[38:04] me and God has the ability to take it
[38:06] away
[38:07] and who am I to question his wisdom and
[38:11] how he handles it
[38:14] and so that was the thing that Eve had a
[38:16] problem with
[38:17] she wanted to use her intellectual
[38:19] ability
[38:21] instead of standing on god-given wisdom
[38:25] what was it it was the word that was
[38:26] preached to her
[38:28] who stand on the word and listen you
[38:30] stand there
[38:31] but when she got it in her mind that
[38:33] there was a better way that Satan had a
[38:35] better way that the serpent had had this
[38:37] new idea this new revelation that he was
[38:40] going to share with her that she was
[38:41] going to take a part of something when
[38:43] she got a hold of that and it's like you
[38:45] know what this this is so great this is
[38:47] so great because I got something to do
[38:50] and it looks so good and it looks so
[38:52] great and it's just so exciting
[38:55] and it's contrary to the word
[38:58] and when she when she done that then all
[39:00] of a sudden when she received that in
[39:02] her mind that she was able to commit an
[39:04] act
[39:05] that was immoral
[39:07] it was contrary to the word
[39:09] but you know she didn't see that
[39:12] and when Adam when Adam came to the
[39:15] scene you know when he seen what took
[39:16] place and then he all you know took took
[39:18] a part of that
[39:20] when he part took him and realized what
[39:23] was taking place he should have not had
[39:24] anything to do with that
[39:27] right but because of his love you know
[39:28] they both win it
[39:30] away from God they broke the
[39:33] Commandments of God but here it was that
[39:34] when they done all these things
[39:37] God made a way for them
[39:39] God made a way for him come back but you
[39:42] know the wonderful thing is is when God
[39:44] knows exactly what you're going to do
[39:46] when you're going to do it how you're
[39:47] going to do it he knew I was going to
[39:49] take play what was going to take place
[39:50] and he already had a because the lamb
[39:53] stood from the found slain from the
[39:54] foundation of the world he already had a
[39:56] way made he knew what was going to take
[39:58] place what a wonderful thing that even
[40:00] though because many times we'll get in
[40:02] our in our in our human existence in our
[40:04] life we get so Bound by things that have
[40:06] taken place and we allow the devil to
[40:08] get in into situations and things happen
[40:10] and you know we get so Bound by the
[40:12] things that have taken place but you
[40:14] know what thank God God already knew
[40:15] about that God knew what were you was
[40:18] going to be at God knew all your faults
[40:19] and failures and all your problems and
[40:21] all your disciples
[40:25] God still
[40:26] made for you because you're always a
[40:28] part of him
[40:29] if you were chosen to him before the
[40:31] foundation of the world praise God I
[40:33] always was a part of him and it doesn't
[40:35] really matter what takes place I can't
[40:37] be lost because if God thought of me and
[40:39] the eternals then it was what I always
[40:41] be there and that's what I'm going back
[40:43] to I've come from God I'm going back to
[40:46] God I can't get away from that
[40:49] I may stumble I may fall I may fail but
[40:51] praise God there's a way that I've
[40:53] that's been made for me and all I got to
[40:55] do is walk in that even even when
[40:58] brother Brandon was standing there
[40:59] talking about brother Ramsay in the
[41:01] Hebrew series even when when a child of
[41:03] God Falls and won't go back when you
[41:05] made it when you're still a child of God
[41:06] no matter where you go or what you do
[41:08] you you're still not lost
[41:11] but there's a punishment that comes
[41:13] you're still corrected there's still
[41:14] chastisement but praise God he doesn't
[41:16] do away with you the love of God is
[41:19] greater amen then all of our sins all of
[41:22] our problems all our heartaches whatever
[41:23] comes our way the love of God is greater
[41:25] than that
[41:28] amen and the prayer the power of God is
[41:31] because through the father through the
[41:33] new birth we have received this power
[41:34] that has come inside of us
[41:38] Jesus says in acts in Acts 1 8 we know
[41:40] the scripture he said you shall receive
[41:41] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[41:44] you and he said he said then you begin
[41:46] to be Witnesses unto me and all through
[41:48] throughout Judea and all Samaria and all
[41:51] the different places the other most
[41:52] parts of the world so he said you shall
[41:54] receive power
[41:56] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[41:58] and we know that the Holy Ghost was
[42:00] given for a re you know because when the
[42:02] Holy Ghost has come he is our he is our
[42:04] advocate he is our God
[42:06] he's our propitiation all these things
[42:08] that that this he's our seal all these
[42:11] things that have been given to us by the
[42:13] Holy Ghost and we also receive power and
[42:15] he said he said you've been led into all
[42:18] truth he's here to lead and guide you
[42:20] into all truth
[42:21] and as as we because if you know where
[42:23] you're standing then you have power
[42:27] you have authority to when you know
[42:30] where you stand
[42:32] because many times if you don't know
[42:34] where you're standing if you don't
[42:35] understand then you know what you don't
[42:37] have a way you don't know what to do
[42:40] because you know one of the one of the
[42:42] worst problems that people have is in
[42:44] action
[42:46] you know you listen to brother Brandon
[42:48] talk about you know he would stand there
[42:49] and you know and the Lord got on to
[42:51] brother Brown many times because you
[42:52] know all he wanted to do is just stand
[42:53] there and say well Lord what am I
[42:55] supposed to do
[42:56] and he said what are you going to say
[42:58] about it
[43:00] what are you going to say about it
[43:02] you know there was a time brother random
[43:04] had to had the vision
[43:06] or the the angel Lord spoke to him the
[43:10] Lord spoke to him and told him said
[43:11] listen he said you're getting ready to
[43:12] be tried there's a trial coming and he
[43:14] began to speak you know he began to
[43:16] think about it and he you know had
[43:17] people praying he was trying to figure
[43:19] out what was going to take place and you
[43:21] know when he went through all that he
[43:22] didn't know what was going to take place
[43:23] but he was but he was thinking on that
[43:26] and he kept meditating on it so Lord you
[43:28] know what am I what do you want me to do
[43:29] what am I supposed to do and you know he
[43:31] was in that meeting that night and he
[43:32] was up there and he seen that young man
[43:34] and young woman up there in the balcony
[43:36] acting immorally and he kept telling
[43:38] them to stop
[43:39] and you know what that man just looked
[43:41] at him and just kept on
[43:43] and he said you know this is a this is a
[43:45] house of God this is a meeting and he
[43:46] said you shouldn't act like that and you
[43:48] know if you're not going if you're gonna
[43:48] act like that you need to leave
[43:51] but you know what that man was arrogant
[43:53] and his his approach and kept doing that
[43:56] and he didn't change anything but you
[43:57] know what then the Lord spoke to brother
[43:59] Branham and said whatever you say
[44:02] whatever you say will happen
[44:06] he said now it lays in your life what
[44:08] will you say when that person comes up
[44:10] before you
[44:13] their souls are in your hands what will
[44:16] you do
[44:19] and you know brother Brandon said he
[44:21] could have spoke and both of them they'd
[44:23] have carried both of them out
[44:26] they'd have both dropped dead in the
[44:28] floor and they'd carried them out
[44:31] but you know brother Branham said
[44:34] you think
[44:36] the love of God
[44:38] and he said I forgive you
[44:42] because that was that was the love of
[44:44] God that was the spirit of God being
[44:46] made known
[44:49] my and they said you know they got up
[44:51] and left but he realized that was the
[44:54] test
[44:56] what would what would we do in that
[44:57] situation
[45:00] because sometimes you know it's like hey
[45:01] you know what
[45:02] I'm gonna Flex my muscle
[45:07] but you know we don't approach it with
[45:08] humility
[45:11] right sometimes we don't put ourselves
[45:12] in the other person's shoes
[45:15] if we were in that if we were in that
[45:17] position what would you want somebody to
[45:19] do for you
[45:21] that's that's that's Grace that's Mercy
[45:24] when when you when you don't deserve it
[45:26] but you show it to somebody
[45:31] see when when the Holy Ghost comes and
[45:33] we have we receive that power
[45:36] see then it gives us the other thing it
[45:38] gives us boldness
[45:42] you know Brothers speaking of there he
[45:44] said you know he said they were a bunch
[45:45] of they were a bunch of cowards up in
[45:46] the upper room wondering if what was
[45:48] going to take place what was what was
[45:49] going to happen next what what you know
[45:51] they were all all scared you know
[45:53] looking out the windows and peeking
[45:55] around the doors and you know they're so
[45:57] scared of what was going to take place
[45:58] because you know what we don't know
[45:59] what's going on
[46:01] right but praise God when the Holy Ghost
[46:03] came
[46:05] and you know they had they had to wait
[46:07] he said Terry to you being due with
[46:09] power from on high well you know when
[46:11] the when the when the Holy Ghost came he
[46:13] didn't tell them what was going to take
[46:14] place
[46:16] he told he didn't he never told Peter
[46:19] and them he said listen y'all go wait in
[46:21] the upper room you need to wait 10 days
[46:25] and what's going to be what's going to
[46:26] be the sign is this rushing Mighty Wind
[46:28] is going to blow in
[46:30] and tongues of fire is going to split
[46:31] and lay upon all of you then you'll know
[46:33] you got the Holy Ghost
[46:36] no he told him he said he said y'all go
[46:38] Terry in Jerusalem to you being dude
[46:41] with power from on high and when they
[46:43] went and so they didn't know what they
[46:45] were waiting on
[46:48] they sat there waiting well what is it
[46:50] well I think we might just take it by
[46:52] faith
[46:54] he's like well you know I think I think
[46:56] we might have we've been here we've been
[46:57] here nine days
[46:59] I think we pretty much got it
[47:02] how much you know how much longer do you
[47:04] think we need to wait
[47:07] but you know what it never it never
[47:08] changed who they were
[47:11] they never had a change why because nine
[47:13] days in you know what I'm sure they
[47:15] probably they probably had a little bit
[47:16] of relief because you know what so far
[47:18] we've been here nine days and we ain't
[47:20] nothing happened to us we were probably
[47:22] a little more scared the first two days
[47:23] wondering what was going on but you know
[47:26] what the Romans ain't showed up now it's
[47:27] been nine days we might have flown under
[47:29] the radar a little bit
[47:31] but you know what they still was
[47:32] wondering what was going to take place
[47:36] but you know what they still was waiting
[47:38] and tearing for the answer from heaven
[47:41] what what the answer was that they were
[47:43] waiting for whatever Jesus told them
[47:46] they were still waiting on that
[47:47] [Music]
[47:49] they'll praise God when the answer came
[47:52] when when the spirit came you know what
[47:54] they didn't have to worry about whether
[47:55] they had it or not they didn't have to
[47:57] worry about it why because they were so
[47:59] afraid and so scared and so and so
[48:01] nervous and so upset by things but you
[48:04] know when they got full of the Holy
[48:05] Ghost when the Holy Ghost fell upon them
[48:07] that day you know what they got so happy
[48:09] they got so drunk in the spirit that
[48:12] they staggered out the door like drunk
[48:13] people and you know they did not care
[48:15] what anybody thought of them they didn't
[48:17] care what anybody said to them why
[48:19] because they had something they had the
[48:21] Assurance of the word had come in
[48:23] because all of a sudden what they had
[48:25] heard for three and a half years became
[48:27] a living reality to them and then when
[48:29] they walked out the door Peter could
[48:31] stand up there with the 11 and began to
[48:33] speak to him and said listen we're not
[48:34] drunk like you think they are we're not
[48:36] this but this is that that was spoken by
[48:39] the prophet Joel and now this is the
[48:41] manifestation of what you've read all
[48:43] those years that you've been sitting in
[48:44] the temple reading the books and over
[48:46] all the all the priests and everybody
[48:48] been standing around all the rabbis and
[48:50] the Sadducees everybody have stood
[48:51] around looked at this all this but let
[48:53] me tell you now's the manifestation of
[48:55] that you're standing in the front of the
[48:56] manifestation of that and he said it is
[48:59] preached unto you because this is for
[49:01] you and your children and to them that's
[49:03] a far off even as many as the Lord Our
[49:05] God shall call
[49:07] so it was the Holy Ghost that began to
[49:09] make a boldness and begin to preach and
[49:11] began to identify the word to them
[49:14] and when they begin to hear the word
[49:16] then they begin to hear the word in
[49:18] their own tongues they began to
[49:19] understand what God had said to them and
[49:22] they began to understand that when they
[49:24] began to catch on to them then they were
[49:26] quickened by they were pricked by the
[49:27] word and they come forth to brother to
[49:30] the apostles and ask them you know how
[49:31] do we get saved and they were received
[49:33] and were baptized and received the Holy
[49:36] Ghost
[49:37] and it was 3 000 added at one time
[49:41] as a brother was talking about he said
[49:43] he's an amazing thing about that you
[49:45] imagine there's 3 000 people come in and
[49:47] they all of a sudden they all want to
[49:49] get baptized well how many people were
[49:51] there well there was a hundred and
[49:52] twenty in the upper room
[49:54] well if half of them were men you got 60
[49:57] people
[49:59] if you take half of them
[50:01] you got 3 000 people trying to get
[50:02] baptized each person so you got you got
[50:05] 50 people out there 60 people out there
[50:07] in the water baptizing 50 people a per a
[50:10] purse
[50:12] so you know what it wasn't just them
[50:14] coming and preaching the word well you
[50:15] know what they spent a long time because
[50:17] brother brother Wade and brother down
[50:19] they can tell you you started getting
[50:20] out there baptizing about five or six
[50:22] people after that you know what you
[50:24] start getting tired
[50:26] it starts wearing on you
[50:28] next thing you know you've got a whole
[50:30] bunch you know and that probably took a
[50:32] little while you get everybody in the
[50:33] water and all of a sudden it's baptizing
[50:35] one and baptizing another baptizing
[50:37] another
[50:39] but you know that's that's the work of
[50:41] the lord it's not just well the praise
[50:42] the Lord you know what the holy photos
[50:43] fell and they just but you think they
[50:45] had to labor
[50:47] there was a lot of work that took place
[50:48] that time
[50:50] behind the scene there was a lot of work
[50:51] that took place that's a lot you know
[50:53] because they had to labor with that
[50:56] he tried to baptize three thousand
[50:58] people there's a whole bunch of people
[50:59] out there looking saying
[51:02] what are they doing
[51:04] no doubt that was probably a little
[51:05] crowd that gathered up around the water
[51:07] you got 3 000 people getting baptized
[51:10] it's like
[51:12] how many people do you know that got
[51:13] baptized
[51:16] well you know John baptized people you
[51:20] remember that crazy fella come out of
[51:21] the boots
[51:22] he was dunking people in the water too
[51:26] and Jesus you know that other fella
[51:29] he's another dunking people in the motor
[51:31] too yeah you know when all of a sudden
[51:33] you start seeing all these crazy people
[51:35] you know they all gather around trying
[51:37] to figure out what's going on
[51:39] he's like I don't know about y'all but
[51:41] we got to keep an eye on that group
[51:42] right there
[51:45] but all of a sudden you know they had a
[51:46] testimony
[51:48] all of a sudden you know they began they
[51:50] began to preach the word and begin to
[51:53] live a life before the people that you
[51:54] know it wasn't it wasn't just hey we're
[51:56] just trying to teach you something no
[51:58] they began to manifest the word
[52:00] they began to tell about the word they
[52:02] began to manifest something in front of
[52:03] the people because all of a sudden
[52:05] there's people like well I don't agree
[52:06] with that but let me tell you something
[52:07] there's something different about them
[52:08] people there's something different about
[52:10] them you may not agree with it but you
[52:12] know what they're they're not like
[52:14] everybody else
[52:16] there's power there
[52:18] and here there's lots of people that you
[52:20] know they they want to get away from
[52:21] that
[52:22] Peter and John as they were walking in
[52:25] the in the word and began to preach and
[52:27] prophesy and then again to speak to the
[52:28] people and do Miracles you know it's
[52:30] like hey you can't do that here
[52:33] you know what you might you might do
[52:34] that some other place but you know what
[52:36] we're respectable people around here and
[52:38] we're not going to have any Riff Raff
[52:40] around here
[52:41] and we're gonna put you in jail lock you
[52:43] up beat you up whatever you're not going
[52:45] to do that around here
[52:47] and you know what and they got and the
[52:49] scripture tells us that Peter and John
[52:51] and them when those things happen to
[52:53] them you know what all they've done was
[52:54] it made them more bold
[52:56] praise the Lord that I can I can suffer
[52:59] for the name of Jesus Christ for the
[53:01] word and you know what you're not going
[53:02] to stop me I get I get more more excited
[53:05] I get more energized because of what's
[53:08] taking place
[53:10] can you imagine
[53:12] can you imagine people today
[53:17] and I don't want to say because you know
[53:18] I'd have to raise both of mine
[53:20] but you know when things happen things
[53:21] come our ways bad things happen and you
[53:23] know what instead of raising our hands
[53:25] and thanking the lord hey you know what
[53:26] praise the Lord that these things come
[53:28] our way you know many times we get a
[53:30] well I don't know why did that happen to
[53:31] me
[53:32] why did why did that happen to me you
[53:36] know I you know here I am trying to do
[53:37] the work of the Lord and all they're
[53:39] trying to do is hinder me
[53:41] but you know what that's what Satan is
[53:43] supposed to do
[53:44] that's Satan's job he's supposed to
[53:46] hinder the work of the Lord however he
[53:49] can
[53:50] but you know what it made them more bold
[53:54] and like you know what you can do
[53:55] whatever you want to to me but you know
[53:58] what when when they when you let us out
[53:59] of here we're gonna go out and we're
[54:00] gonna be more bold and because we're
[54:02] going to preach more
[54:05] well because it's the leading of just
[54:07] just like those people the the saints
[54:09] that we're in in China years ago when
[54:11] they when they first received the
[54:13] message you know brother bisco and the
[54:14] different ones were over there
[54:15] ministering to them and you know all of
[54:17] a sudden they were so afraid of what the
[54:19] what the government was going to do to
[54:20] them and all the you know they're so
[54:22] afraid well you know what after they got
[54:23] locked up and put in jail when I got out
[54:25] you know what that was a boldness That
[54:27] Came Upon them people
[54:30] you know what they praise God you know
[54:31] what because we can suffer for the name
[54:33] of Christ but you know what it makes up
[54:35] it makes us more boat
[54:37] why because you know that's what God has
[54:39] called us to be bold before the people
[54:41] we've got a testimony I'm not ashamed of
[54:45] the Gospel of Jesus Christ so I'm not
[54:47] backing up from it I'm standing firm I'm
[54:49] going to let everybody know
[54:54] when those when those people went in the
[54:56] you know the Saints in China when they
[54:57] were under persecution and all those and
[54:59] it was a church over there that you know
[55:01] they they gathered and they kept having
[55:02] been harassed by the by the government
[55:04] you know they kept having issues for
[55:06] every place that they were meeting and
[55:08] all that and the pastor stood up one day
[55:10] and he told him he said listen he said I
[55:12] want everybody to go home and pray he
[55:14] said I'm not going to tell you where
[55:15] we're going to have church he said let
[55:17] the Lord speak to you and wherever the
[55:19] Lord tells you we're going to have
[55:20] church next Sunday next time said you'll
[55:24] show up
[55:25] he said we didn't we need to make any
[55:27] plans but they began to pray each one of
[55:30] them began to pray and because there was
[55:32] some reason that somehow the government
[55:34] kept finding out what was going on and
[55:35] where they were meeting and all those
[55:36] things but when they began to pray then
[55:39] the Lord began to speak to each one of
[55:41] those people and guess what at that
[55:43] point in time they all showed up for
[55:45] service except for one person
[55:48] why because it was the one that was
[55:51] against them the one that was in there
[55:52] but God LED them and all of a sudden
[55:55] when when they realized you know what
[55:56] we've gone through all of this and all
[55:58] of a sudden you talk about you talk
[56:00] about a boldness that come upon those
[56:01] people why because God because all of a
[56:04] sudden they realized that God was in
[56:05] their mess God was leading them even
[56:07] though they had suffered for all this
[56:09] time and all these problems but yet you
[56:11] know what there was come a time that God
[56:12] began to speak to them and led them to a
[56:14] place that they come out from underneath
[56:16] that and all of a sudden they realized
[56:18] you know what it's not it's not just
[56:19] some just some problem or whatever but
[56:21] God made a way for them and God LED them
[56:24] through then all of a sudden they Rose
[56:25] there's a boldness that come on because
[56:27] we've seen God work in our midst we've
[56:29] seen God work miracles in our midst
[56:31] and when you when you began to see the
[56:33] how God began to work in their midst all
[56:35] of a sudden it became a boldness upon
[56:37] those people and they began to express
[56:39] these things to the to the people and
[56:41] began to uh let the people know God's
[56:43] real what God has done for me
[56:47] when we come through these things we
[56:49] know that that when we receive
[56:53] the the Holy Ghost the new birth is it's
[56:56] come upon us and we realize that there's
[56:58] a child training and you know we have to
[57:00] grow up
[57:01] there's a training that goes through and
[57:03] you know brother Ram talked about in the
[57:05] restoration of the broad tree he was
[57:06] talking about the the young man that was
[57:08] going through his training and he said
[57:10] the news man was following him he was
[57:12] out there and he's talking about the
[57:13] machine gun fire going over his head and
[57:15] he was talking about the sand in his
[57:16] pocket and all that kind of stuff he
[57:18] said he was going through all that rigid
[57:19] training he said that's what we're doing
[57:21] here we're going through rigid training
[57:22] well because he said there's a
[57:24] battlefield out there but we got to go
[57:25] through training now to get ready for
[57:27] that battle because we don't know what's
[57:29] going to come our way but God is
[57:30] training us to be weapons of of the
[57:33] Warfare of the spirit spiritual warfare
[57:35] of Jesus Christ
[57:37] that we are we are to be soldiers of the
[57:39] army of God
[57:41] well you know we have to go through
[57:42] these things and you know we don't
[57:44] understand why we have to go through
[57:45] these things
[57:47] but praise God brother Brown said that
[57:48] God knows how to train a man he go he
[57:51] knows exactly what you need to go
[57:52] through to make you into the person that
[57:54] you ought to be
[57:55] you know we go through these things and
[57:57] you know uh I was talking about you know
[58:00] brother Andre was in the was in the
[58:02] Marines and you know one of the things I
[58:04] was talking about when I was up there
[58:05] you know you talk about you know brother
[58:07] Donnie said one time and
[58:09] I've told many people this brother
[58:11] Donnie said one time he said you know
[58:12] you go through the Marine Corps you
[58:13] become a Marine he said whatever they
[58:15] teach you to do he said if you'll just
[58:17] follow what they tell you to do all you
[58:19] got to do is follow the exactly way and
[58:21] you can do whatever they tell you to do
[58:23] it may look it may look so impossible to
[58:25] you but all you gotta do is come to the
[58:27] place that because you if you get in the
[58:29] into the Marines and you go through the
[58:31] training they make it in your mind that
[58:33] you follow exactly what they tell you to
[58:35] do and you get to the places you could
[58:37] believe what they tell you that that you
[58:39] can do and all you got to do is follow
[58:41] what they tell you and how to do it and
[58:42] guess what you'll you'll overcome you'll
[58:45] do whatever they tell you that you can
[58:46] do
[58:47] you know it's he says you know to adapt
[58:49] and improvise and overcome whatever you
[58:53] come against whatever you do if you
[58:54] follow the plan then you'll overcome and
[58:57] it's the same way brother scissors with
[58:58] the plan of Jesus Christ with the word
[59:00] of God you can overcome and there's a
[59:02] way made but you come through that
[59:04] training if you just follow that plan
[59:06] you will overcome but there's a way
[59:08] maybe already made the way is already
[59:10] made but you all you got to do is
[59:12] believe it and walk in it if you will
[59:15] just walk in that way if you will follow
[59:17] the plan you'll overcome
[59:20] why because that's what he wants us to
[59:22] do to have confidence in God in the word
[59:24] he wants us to have confidence in these
[59:27] things that we can believe what God Said
[59:29] is true and all we got to do is believe
[59:31] it
[59:32] and then we can walk in it
[59:37] period this is from the message why
[59:40] Christ big brother I'm speaking of of
[59:42] Moses and he's talking about going
[59:43] through all this training and they said
[59:44] you know hey at one time
[59:47] he said standing in the presence of the
[59:49] anointing
[59:50] in the presence of a burning bush he
[59:52] said he knew more about God than he
[59:54] learned in books in the 80 years of his
[59:56] life God trains in man and then anoints
[59:58] him gives him experience
[1:00:00] takes him through the rigor training
[1:00:02] right down through the Sands of a
[1:00:04] burning punishment trying and testing
[1:00:07] not only does he do that to His prophets
[1:00:09] he does that to his children every son
[1:00:12] that cometh to God must be chastised and
[1:00:15] tried tested by the by his word see then
[1:00:17] the pinch comes the strong time when it
[1:00:20] comes when he faces death you are able
[1:00:22] to stand there on the word of God see
[1:00:24] God said so that settles it so when you
[1:00:27] go through these things it looks so hard
[1:00:29] and they're so tough and whatever it may
[1:00:31] be but yo if you follow the plan that
[1:00:33] God has laid out then you're able to
[1:00:35] overcome
[1:00:38] whatever whatever you know many times we
[1:00:40] go through lots of training but you know
[1:00:43] it may be only for one time but you know
[1:00:45] what I would rather just like the the
[1:00:47] man that you know the lady that the
[1:00:49] brother Ram talks about you know she
[1:00:50] just ran at that barn and she got
[1:00:52] everything ready to have one church
[1:00:54] service because it was so burning upon
[1:00:56] her heart to have one certain service to
[1:00:58] to
[1:00:59] evangelize the city
[1:01:01] and you know she cleaned everything up
[1:01:03] got everything ready and hired a
[1:01:04] preacher to have one service why because
[1:01:06] that was her goal to reach out to the
[1:01:08] lost because it was burning on her heart
[1:01:10] to do that why because they were lost
[1:01:12] and dying everywhere and she went in
[1:01:14] there to have a church service and only
[1:01:16] one person showed up
[1:01:18] well you know what everybody else would
[1:01:19] have looked at though and said well you
[1:01:21] know what that was an utter failure that
[1:01:24] was a waste of time why would you do
[1:01:25] that
[1:01:26] but you know what they didn't realize
[1:01:28] that the young man that walked into that
[1:01:29] night and received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] received the Lord tonight God saved to
[1:01:33] come into the kingdom of God that night
[1:01:35] was Dwight Moody
[1:01:38] Heroes DL Moody and what did Brother
[1:01:39] Brown said hundreds and thousands were
[1:01:41] saved under his ministry he read
[1:01:44] thousands to the Lord under his ministry
[1:01:46] but what was it they didn't see that
[1:01:49] they didn't say the uh they didn't say a
[1:01:51] long-range Vision they didn't see them
[1:01:53] Through The Eyes of Faith they didn't
[1:01:54] see what was going to take place all I
[1:01:56] could say was just some little old woman
[1:01:58] they would just maybe she didn't have
[1:02:00] two nickels to rub together but she
[1:02:02] spent all she had done whatever she
[1:02:03] could to rent that little barn and have
[1:02:06] a service and only one person showed up
[1:02:08] and said I would have wasted my time to
[1:02:10] do that well you know what if we could
[1:02:12] see through the eyes of faith that we
[1:02:13] could see in that other dimension to see
[1:02:15] what was taking place then you know what
[1:02:17] how many people would have stood up and
[1:02:18] said I want to be there
[1:02:20] I had to swap places with her
[1:02:23] why because she had to do nothing and it
[1:02:25] was just that one little thing that took
[1:02:27] place and in the midst of all that when
[1:02:28] that took place then what happened look
[1:02:33] yeah
[1:02:34] many times we fail to see that what God
[1:02:36] has called us to do just small things
[1:02:38] just the minor things together we don't
[1:02:40] realize how much of an impact it will
[1:02:43] take place
[1:02:44] what kind of Eternal impact these things
[1:02:46] are going to have
[1:02:50] you know just it's just you think about
[1:02:52] the they're a woman uh
[1:02:54] when the with a woman there was and
[1:02:56] Elijah when he was sitting down there by
[1:02:58] the Brook cherith and you know and the
[1:03:00] Ravens were feeding him and he was
[1:03:02] sitting there and everything everything
[1:03:03] was drying up in in Egypt and Israel and
[1:03:06] everything was you know drying up and
[1:03:07] there was nothing there and all all the
[1:03:09] uh cursed
[1:03:12] upon everybody
[1:03:15] when Elijah told him he said listen he
[1:03:16] said he said it won't rain until I call
[1:03:18] for it
[1:03:21] because the sin that y'all have
[1:03:23] committed here that God has brought this
[1:03:25] upon y'all
[1:03:26] and they're standing there and under the
[1:03:28] midst all those people are dying trying
[1:03:30] to make a living trying to scrape by
[1:03:31] trying to do what they can to survive
[1:03:35] and yet the prophet is sitting down by
[1:03:37] the Brook cherith and you know what he's
[1:03:39] drinking out of the brook and the Ravens
[1:03:41] are feeding him
[1:03:43] let me tell you something about decision
[1:03:45] when you're in Christ there's a place
[1:03:47] that God will bring you to and sometimes
[1:03:49] like I've said it before sometimes we go
[1:03:51] through things in our life we don't know
[1:03:52] why things happen the way they do
[1:03:54] sometimes we're sitting at the brook
[1:03:55] cherith and we don't even realize it
[1:03:57] God's brought us to a place he's feeding
[1:03:59] you he's taking care of you he wants you
[1:04:01] to be in this place as a place of
[1:04:04] refreshment
[1:04:06] a place of Rejuvenation that you come
[1:04:08] into
[1:04:12] sometimes God don't want us always up
[1:04:14] and going and doing things sometimes
[1:04:15] it's just a quiet
[1:04:20] and then when the brook dried up he went
[1:04:22] down there to the widow woman
[1:04:24] he's down there having a great time
[1:04:26] Supernatural meetings going on
[1:04:28] and she was drying up trying to make a
[1:04:30] living dying
[1:04:32] and here she is down there and and
[1:04:34] trying to make buying it and when when
[1:04:36] the prophet comes down there and speaks
[1:04:37] to her he says hi can I get a drink of
[1:04:40] water
[1:04:41] you know she didn't have a problem with
[1:04:42] that
[1:04:44] but when it comes to giving that morsel
[1:04:46] of bread
[1:04:48] can you bring me a more celebrate in
[1:04:49] your hand
[1:04:51] she had a problem with that
[1:04:53] listen I ain't got nothing
[1:04:56] I got just I just got some leftovers
[1:04:58] over here ain't much of nothing left
[1:05:02] so we're gonna we're gonna I got two
[1:05:04] sticks we're gonna build a fire we're
[1:05:05] gonna make up the rest of this we're
[1:05:07] gonna eat it and die
[1:05:09] you see everybody all around us
[1:05:11] everything dried up you know how many
[1:05:13] people we know that have already died
[1:05:18] can you see can you see all the
[1:05:19] devastation going on
[1:05:24] well I think all that
[1:05:26] and you know what he didn't run up there
[1:05:27] and tell her listen I want to tell you
[1:05:29] something I've seen the supernatural
[1:05:32] I had the Ravens come feed me
[1:05:36] he didn't tell her any of that
[1:05:39] but he told but he told her he said
[1:05:41] listen
[1:05:42] if you will give me that little cake
[1:05:44] first just that little bit first
[1:05:47] if you're if you're willing to part with
[1:05:49] a little bit he said I'm going to tell
[1:05:51] you something you're going to see the
[1:05:53] miracle of God you're going to see the
[1:05:55] working of God
[1:05:56] if you just do this one little piece
[1:05:58] right here he said the barrel is never
[1:06:00] going to run out the crews will never
[1:06:02] run dry
[1:06:04] everybody else is going to be missing
[1:06:06] but you know what you're going to have
[1:06:07] enough to sustain you all these years
[1:06:11] if you can just take this one little
[1:06:13] part
[1:06:13] if you're a little if you're willing to
[1:06:15] do your little part
[1:06:17] and you know what
[1:06:19] she's like I can do that
[1:06:21] because you know what she's like I got
[1:06:23] nothing to lose
[1:06:27] I could stand here and hold on to what I
[1:06:29] got but you know what she's like you
[1:06:30] know what I'm gonna die anyway
[1:06:34] but you know what there is a way made
[1:06:36] amen and I can take it by faith
[1:06:39] and believe if I believe this you know
[1:06:41] what there's a way that I could live
[1:06:45] it's like well I'm going to take I'm
[1:06:47] gonna take you at your word
[1:06:49] and made that one little cake for him
[1:06:51] and brought that water and he was able
[1:06:52] to eat that
[1:06:54] but what she gave by her faith in that
[1:06:56] little portion
[1:06:58] then you know we think well that's
[1:07:00] that's very insignificant but it meant a
[1:07:02] lot to her
[1:07:03] and through that one little bit that was
[1:07:05] given then through that she was able to
[1:07:09] be sustained
[1:07:11] amen you should imagine every day she
[1:07:14] just giving that one a little more slow
[1:07:15] bread but every day she would go in
[1:07:17] there more Devastation more death
[1:07:20] more heartache
[1:07:22] all the problems that was there in Egypt
[1:07:24] I mean Israel when she was going through
[1:07:26] all of that and but you know what she
[1:07:28] would go back in the kitchen and open up
[1:07:30] Merrell that Barrel
[1:07:32] the mill Barrel
[1:07:34] and you know what he was still in there
[1:07:37] scoop it out
[1:07:40] turn up that Crucible
[1:07:42] start making a bread
[1:07:46] there's nothing in there now
[1:07:48] go back in there the next morning take
[1:07:50] that lid off sitting there
[1:07:52] scoop it up
[1:07:56] if we have faith
[1:07:58] to believe God what can we do
[1:08:01] what could we do if we just had if we
[1:08:03] just took God at his word
[1:08:07] you know what you're not going you're
[1:08:08] not going to convince people
[1:08:12] I just like sister Dale was talking
[1:08:14] about when
[1:08:16] when brother Dale was sick
[1:08:20] and she come up here was giving that
[1:08:21] testimony
[1:08:25] come on
[1:08:26] you know the Lord come in that room
[1:08:30] he was in the floor somebody put him on
[1:08:31] that bed
[1:08:34] somebody come in that room
[1:08:37] but you know what she stood there and
[1:08:39] those paramedics with our told Lisa it's
[1:08:42] like who you know what happened well I
[1:08:44] don't know which of course she did but
[1:08:46] she wasn't going to tell them because I
[1:08:48] wasn't going to believe her
[1:08:51] we just we were just in the presence of
[1:08:53] the almighty and you know what the
[1:08:54] supernatural took place in this room
[1:08:56] right now
[1:08:58] then they got to start looking for you
[1:09:00] know
[1:09:03] it's like we need to refer the
[1:09:05] psychiatrist
[1:09:08] why because they're not going to believe
[1:09:09] that
[1:09:10] why because they don't but you know what
[1:09:12] if you believe in the Supernatural if
[1:09:14] you know the same God that I know if you
[1:09:16] know what's taking place in your life
[1:09:18] then you know what Supernatural is and
[1:09:20] you know what he's here every single day
[1:09:22] of your life he'll wake up in the
[1:09:24] morning with you he'll go through with
[1:09:25] you all night long he'll go through the
[1:09:27] day with you and he's always there to
[1:09:29] work a miracle
[1:09:32] there's always there to do whatever it
[1:09:34] needs to be done
[1:09:36] you know I I was telling them up there
[1:09:39] that brother Andre you know what I was
[1:09:41] telling about you know the things that
[1:09:42] that's taking place in our in our lives
[1:09:43] and we've seen these Supernatural things
[1:09:45] this taken place and if you could just
[1:09:47] see the supernatural believe the
[1:09:49] supernatural what God has done you'll
[1:09:51] you'll be amazed
[1:09:54] you know I I sounded about when I was
[1:09:56] working years ago with this company was
[1:09:58] doing robotic arc welding and I was
[1:10:00] looking for it was trying to find a jig
[1:10:02] that held all the parts together and the
[1:10:04] robot does all the welding so jig fits
[1:10:08] all the pieces together
[1:10:09] well he's trying to find one so we could
[1:10:11] finish the job that's all we had to do
[1:10:12] for the day and we went looking at
[1:10:14] everywhere trying to find that one jig
[1:10:16] well there were several racks that had
[1:10:18] all these jigs because some of them was
[1:10:19] nearly as big as this you know the top
[1:10:21] of this Pulpit here you know some of
[1:10:24] them were smaller but some of them were
[1:10:25] big according to what size the parts
[1:10:26] were and you know we had all these racks
[1:10:28] everybody was sitting on where everybody
[1:10:29] had a had a plate on the bottom it had
[1:10:31] the number written on it and everybody
[1:10:33] was going by was trying to find this one
[1:10:35] had a certain look to it everybody was
[1:10:37] going through all those racks standing
[1:10:39] there looking up and down trying to
[1:10:41] where was that right in that jig we
[1:10:43] cannot find it
[1:10:45] but you know staying I mean
[1:10:48] standing there that day I prayed the
[1:10:51] Lord I said Lord you know we need this
[1:10:52] jig I need to know where it's at I don't
[1:10:54] know where it's at but you do
[1:10:58] and and and God is my witness I stood
[1:11:01] there and I prayed and the Lord led me
[1:11:03] he just pointed me in that direction I
[1:11:05] just had the unction to go that
[1:11:07] direction I climbed on top of that rack
[1:11:09] and there it was
[1:11:11] and everybody's like where was that he's
[1:11:12] like people climbed all over that thing
[1:11:14] trying to find that looking everywhere
[1:11:15] for it and yeah but you know everybody
[1:11:17] had overlooked that thing and for some
[1:11:19] reason they couldn't find it but you
[1:11:20] know what God knew it and he gave me the
[1:11:21] eyesight he gave me the understanding
[1:11:23] that if I've trusted him and I asked him
[1:11:25] for it then he would show me where it
[1:11:26] was at
[1:11:28] he was like well you know just the
[1:11:30] simple things like that one because God
[1:11:32] wants us to be just to understand that
[1:11:34] he's mindful of the little things in our
[1:11:36] lives
[1:11:38] why was why was when brother Brandon was
[1:11:40] standing there on the lake and he was
[1:11:41] when he was with uh
[1:11:44] I think brother Woods in them when he
[1:11:45] was up there and you know and the Lord
[1:11:47] began to deal with him and in the in the
[1:11:50] third poll and and he was standing there
[1:11:52] talking and seeing that fish die and he
[1:11:55] pulled all his guts out and he was
[1:11:56] laying there why did God heal a little
[1:11:58] fish
[1:11:59] when he said had all of those young all
[1:12:02] those little kids all those kids
[1:12:04] all those kids that were so sick why was
[1:12:06] all those kids that had all those
[1:12:08] afflictions upon them and you know what
[1:12:09] God didn't touch any of them but he
[1:12:11] touched a little fish
[1:12:13] on a lake
[1:12:15] because he said he wanted he was God was
[1:12:18] showing that he was mindful even of the
[1:12:20] little things not just the big things
[1:12:23] but the little things in your life
[1:12:26] if you if you can just imagine the
[1:12:28] little things in your life
[1:12:30] just just like when we lost those when
[1:12:32] we lost those Chuck Keys the van keys
[1:12:35] that time on the job and we we looked at
[1:12:38] we were trying to find those set of keys
[1:12:39] and you know I I tell it many times that
[1:12:42] you know but I still thank the Lord why
[1:12:44] because it you know because it like like
[1:12:47] Moses like God told Moses he said write
[1:12:50] a book of remembrance
[1:12:52] and he said and rehearse these things in
[1:12:54] the ears of Joshua
[1:12:57] why because it was something why because
[1:12:59] Joshua was going to take the people into
[1:13:01] the land why are they because they were
[1:13:02] going to overcome
[1:13:04] and I wanted to say I thought about
[1:13:06] Sister Barbara want everybody to send
[1:13:08] their testimonies in why because there's
[1:13:10] a book of remembrance to be written and
[1:13:12] you can those testimony those things to
[1:13:14] know about these things that you if you
[1:13:16] know about what was taking place and
[1:13:17] what God has done
[1:13:20] what God has done in people's lives then
[1:13:22] you know what you stand up and it's like
[1:13:23] brother Ryan talking about the the
[1:13:25] different testimonies that he's written
[1:13:26] over the years about what's taken place
[1:13:28] what to know about these things what has
[1:13:31] God done in your life what God because
[1:13:32] you know what there's one thing
[1:13:35] and I know that I was wanting to share
[1:13:38] why why did God do these things
[1:13:41] you know because if God has has called
[1:13:43] us to this place why did why did God
[1:13:46] call us to this
[1:13:48] you know it's it's not just just just
[1:13:50] for me because you know what it is it is
[1:13:52] for us as an individual to bring us to a
[1:13:55] place
[1:13:56] but let me tell you something it's for
[1:13:57] us as a body amen for as we read tonight
[1:14:00] every portion of the body has a portion
[1:14:03] to do each one of us have something to
[1:14:05] do and we all have to work together
[1:14:08] brother speaking in the in the message
[1:14:10] and and see he was speaking in the
[1:14:12] message a total Deliverance here and and
[1:14:15] he says he said I wonder this morning as
[1:14:17] Christians if we have yielded our own
[1:14:20] will and wielded ourselves so completely
[1:14:22] to God
[1:14:25] till God can trust us the place that he
[1:14:27] has put us I wonder this morning of
[1:14:30] myself if I could be so yielded to God
[1:14:32] till God can trust me could trust
[1:14:34] brother Neville could trust our trustee
[1:14:35] border Deacon board are members of our
[1:14:37] church he said we all have a place and
[1:14:40] we got a duty
[1:14:41] and he's talking about what what a
[1:14:43] Minister's place is
[1:14:45] and he's talking about just continue on
[1:14:48] down to 53 just keep on scrolling up
[1:14:50] there
[1:14:51] and he's talking about the church and he
[1:14:53] says God gives complete deliverance
[1:14:56] and he says he was he will do it it will
[1:14:59] it will completely surrender ourselves
[1:15:02] to him
[1:15:03] if we will completely deliver ourselves
[1:15:06] into his hand then God can live us
[1:15:08] Christ the hope of glory he can reflect
[1:15:10] himself from us as we get ourselves out
[1:15:13] of the way then our thoughts are his
[1:15:15] thoughts he said could you imagine
[1:15:17] Christ smoking a cigar could you imagine
[1:15:19] Christ drinking or playing cards then if
[1:15:22] your spirit is part of his Spirit then
[1:15:23] he wants you he wants it to be upon your
[1:15:26] confession but you you but you permit
[1:15:29] the devil to come in and take over and
[1:15:31] all the time in your heart way down deep
[1:15:33] you know you're wrong when you do those
[1:15:36] things
[1:15:37] he said when one member would talk
[1:15:39] against the other member you know that's
[1:15:41] wrong you're commanded to pray for one
[1:15:42] another not to talk against one another
[1:15:44] but to love one another and if someone
[1:15:46] is down let's pick him up help him now
[1:15:49] that makes us a unified group of
[1:15:51] Believers now when we don't obey that
[1:15:54] when we don't obey God we displease God
[1:15:56] and therefore our church our people
[1:15:58] cannot Prosper the church cannot go on
[1:16:01] because we're disunified together as
[1:16:05] Jesus said a little 11 11th of the lump
[1:16:09] and so we we all have these portions to
[1:16:11] do but we all got to do what God wants
[1:16:13] us to do you know because we can we can
[1:16:16] allow these things to come in and you
[1:16:18] know just as many times we go through
[1:16:20] the scripture and all the the different
[1:16:22] ones aching and different ones come to
[1:16:23] mind you you look at the scripture and
[1:16:25] when when you don't follow the plan of
[1:16:27] God if you don't follow the leading of
[1:16:29] the Lord you know what then everybody
[1:16:30] fails there's a there's a total failure
[1:16:33] in the but you know but if we all work
[1:16:35] together if we all are unified because
[1:16:37] we don't have any big eyes and little
[1:16:39] use but we all have the same common goal
[1:16:42] you know I was thinking about when when
[1:16:44] uh NASA decide you know when they first
[1:16:46] started the Space Program under Kennedy
[1:16:49] you know they were going to put a man on
[1:16:50] the moon that was the that was their
[1:16:52] goal you know when those when those
[1:16:54] scientists and those Engineers come
[1:16:56] together and they were going to they
[1:16:57] were going to beat the Russians because
[1:16:59] you know the Russians had already got
[1:17:01] ahead of us and you know they were
[1:17:02] already in in space and and all those
[1:17:04] things but you know they were young men
[1:17:06] that had raised up and you know they
[1:17:07] were some of them would come out of the
[1:17:09] military and everything like that but
[1:17:10] you know they all work together someone
[1:17:12] some of them had Specialties in certain
[1:17:14] things and certain things but you know
[1:17:16] what they worked in the specialty that
[1:17:18] God had called that they they had they
[1:17:19] they said I went to school for this I'm
[1:17:21] good at this I'm good at this I'm good
[1:17:22] at this then everybody had to do their
[1:17:24] own part
[1:17:25] because what they were and you know what
[1:17:27] they they didn't work together and you
[1:17:28] know what there wasn't no ego filling up
[1:17:30] the room
[1:17:31] why because they had one common goal and
[1:17:33] that was to put a man on the moon that
[1:17:36] was that was their goal and you know
[1:17:38] what they they didn't care what it took
[1:17:39] they were going to work their way
[1:17:40] through it
[1:17:42] you know they all got together so you
[1:17:45] know what because the problems that they
[1:17:47] come up against you know what they
[1:17:49] weren't problems they were opportunities
[1:17:51] to to advance they had they had
[1:17:54] opportunities to overcome
[1:17:59] I got to listen to a man by the name of
[1:18:01] Dr William Lenore and he worked for NASA
[1:18:05] and uh he's actually actually flew on on
[1:18:08] the space shuttle and
[1:18:10] and he was he was talking about that
[1:18:11] because he was there one of the first
[1:18:13] that when Kennedy give the
[1:18:15] you know the commission when he laid it
[1:18:17] out there that what we were going to do
[1:18:18] and he said you know all these all these
[1:18:20] men had been to school been become had
[1:18:22] Doctorate Degrees and and all kinds of
[1:18:24] things physics and engineering and all
[1:18:26] this but you know what those men they
[1:18:28] come together and you know what they had
[1:18:29] they were just so they were just so
[1:18:30] energized that they were going to do
[1:18:32] this
[1:18:33] they never nobody had ever done this
[1:18:35] thing before
[1:18:36] but you know what they conceived it in
[1:18:39] their mind that they could do it and
[1:18:40] know what they done it
[1:18:42] that's all they had to do they had to
[1:18:43] believe that they could do it and you
[1:18:45] know what it didn't matter it's like
[1:18:46] well you've got this issue you got this
[1:18:47] issue
[1:18:49] they didn't stop them
[1:18:53] like wait we're going we're going to do
[1:18:54] it and they done it
[1:18:58] and it's the same thing with you and our
[1:18:59] brothers sisters when things come our
[1:19:02] way we don't understand why things have
[1:19:04] to be
[1:19:06] brother Brown was speaking here in in
[1:19:08] the in the message
[1:19:09] I'm gonna read this one this is from the
[1:19:11] message total deliverance and brother
[1:19:13] I'm speaking this is
[1:19:15] he was speaking of the uh the church
[1:19:18] and he was talking about Jeffersonville
[1:19:19] and
[1:19:21] talk about them wanting to build a
[1:19:22] church and and go through different
[1:19:24] things and
[1:19:25] you know he said well I don't you know
[1:19:27] to me I don't see why we need to build a
[1:19:28] church
[1:19:31] now I'm not I'm not preaching this
[1:19:33] because this is this is trying to you
[1:19:35] know let somebody know something I don't
[1:19:37] got any axes to grind or points to make
[1:19:39] or anything like that I'm just telling
[1:19:41] you what brother Brandon's talking about
[1:19:44] but I want but I want to make this one
[1:19:46] point by what brother Brandon is saying
[1:19:49] but you know he said he said I didn't he
[1:19:51] said I didn't know why we need a church
[1:19:53] but he said I come down and he said I
[1:19:56] saw the the spirit of the people their
[1:19:58] desire
[1:20:00] and he said when I got in there and he
[1:20:01] said he said then I come down
[1:20:04] and I felt the feeling of the church
[1:20:06] that the church and the minority seemed
[1:20:08] to want it
[1:20:10] then he said what did I do he said I
[1:20:12] sacrificed my own thoughts and thrown in
[1:20:14] with the church
[1:20:16] sure let's do it that's the way we cast
[1:20:19] lots that's the way it is in the Bible
[1:20:22] time the way the church voted the
[1:20:25] sovereignty the groups of the people
[1:20:27] they come together in unity their
[1:20:29] strength so I said certainly if that's
[1:20:31] the way the church wants if that's what
[1:20:34] God is wanting
[1:20:35] he's got more of authority to vote
[1:20:38] amongst a group of people
[1:20:40] than he has to me because I've no vision
[1:20:43] to say that it shouldn't be so we throw
[1:20:46] in with the church and move with the
[1:20:48] church and I'm behind it to do all that
[1:20:50] I can see to help out the church
[1:20:54] you know I was I was reading that and I
[1:20:57] just I just jumped off the page at me
[1:20:59] because you know here's here's brother
[1:21:00] around I'm talking about you know I you
[1:21:02] know I just don't see why we need to do
[1:21:03] this but he said the churches the
[1:21:05] churches won't end he said if that's
[1:21:07] what God is wanting he said certainly he
[1:21:09] said he's got more authority to vote
[1:21:11] amongst the people
[1:21:13] than he has with me
[1:21:16] and you know that the reason that stood
[1:21:18] out to me was because you know you think
[1:21:20] you think so many years that when when
[1:21:22] brother Brandon was here it's like you
[1:21:24] know brother Branham should I buy a car
[1:21:27] brother Brown should I do this should I
[1:21:28] do that you know should I Cyril in the
[1:21:31] morning
[1:21:33] you know I mean so many people you know
[1:21:35] they want to hold on to brother Banner
[1:21:37] for every single thing
[1:21:39] no matter how I'm not how small or
[1:21:42] insignificant it was it meant something
[1:21:43] because they wanted to get brother
[1:21:44] branham's idea for everything we're not
[1:21:46] going to do nothing
[1:21:50] you know if brother bam said we all
[1:21:52] should hop into church on one foot you
[1:21:53] know that's what they'd do
[1:21:57] but I mean it was they were so but
[1:21:58] here's brother random saying you know
[1:21:59] what Harry said I if I don't see that in
[1:22:02] the Lord and that's what the people are
[1:22:04] wanting and that's what the Lord is
[1:22:05] working then you know the Lord has the
[1:22:07] ability God has the ability to work
[1:22:09] through the people
[1:22:11] to speak to the people to work as a
[1:22:14] unified group that they would vote in
[1:22:17] the way that needs to be voted
[1:22:19] and the Lord don't have to tell me what
[1:22:21] needs to be done
[1:22:25] that's right brother Randall how are you
[1:22:26] going to vote on this
[1:22:28] well brother Brown said he's not going
[1:22:30] to vote for church so I'm not going to
[1:22:31] vote for a church
[1:22:36] praying
[1:22:37] and seeking the mind of God
[1:22:39] and getting your answer
[1:22:45] and you know we've got we've got people
[1:22:48] you know and and you you know women and
[1:22:51] you know around around the makes
[1:22:53] in the ranks of the message you know
[1:22:55] even people want to hang on to brother
[1:22:56] Dale
[1:22:58] what what should I do what should I do
[1:23:02] and you know so many times I appreciate
[1:23:04] I appreciate a pastor that stands up and
[1:23:07] so many times he stand up and say you
[1:23:09] need to get an answer from God for
[1:23:10] yourself
[1:23:14] he's not your Holy Ghost
[1:23:18] now he can always Point things out and
[1:23:20] sometimes you know he'll never tell you
[1:23:21] yes or no but sometimes he'd just come
[1:23:23] up and make one statement to you
[1:23:27] and it'll make you think
[1:23:29] and then you'll go away thinking about
[1:23:30] that and you'll contemplate what he said
[1:23:33] but it's not an answer
[1:23:35] but it's an Avenue for you to think
[1:23:39] why because you need to pray
[1:23:41] and you need to get an answer from God
[1:23:43] it's not whether his answer is right
[1:23:45] it's what your answer is
[1:23:48] and I thought that was so amazing if we
[1:23:49] work as a unified body then you know
[1:23:51] what I need to pray
[1:23:55] because my portion is in this body
[1:23:59] then if we're going if we're going to
[1:24:00] have an effectual working Body of Christ
[1:24:03] then I've got to do my part
[1:24:07] Then I then I need to seek God for
[1:24:09] myself I need to take care of myself you
[1:24:10] know why because when I do what I'm
[1:24:12] supposed to do it's a benefit to
[1:24:14] everybody
[1:24:16] then it benefits the body it benefits
[1:24:18] the church
[1:24:20] that we all need to instead of instead
[1:24:22] of you know you know
[1:24:24] it's like like I've told like I've told
[1:24:26] the brothers before you know whatever
[1:24:27] goes I'm behind you
[1:24:34] hey if we if if brother Dale stays the
[1:24:36] pastor in another five years praise God
[1:24:38] I'm behind him
[1:24:40] if we Brothers weighed in or somebody
[1:24:42] else in praise God I'm going to be
[1:24:43] behind them
[1:24:45] why because you know like I told you
[1:24:47] before it's it's not it's not a person
[1:24:50] it's not a personality
[1:24:53] it's the leading of the lord it's the
[1:24:55] Holy Ghost
[1:24:57] and guess what if the holy ghost that
[1:24:59] you have is the same holy ghost that I
[1:25:00] have then guess what he should put it we
[1:25:02] should be going in the same direction
[1:25:05] and if you don't get and if you don't
[1:25:08] get an answer but you know what if if
[1:25:09] like through the like brother Ram said
[1:25:11] through the body if it's if a vote comes
[1:25:15] a certain way then you know what we
[1:25:16] should well you know I didn't agree with
[1:25:17] that
[1:25:19] I don't like that
[1:25:22] well then you know what we need to put
[1:25:23] our feelings behind us
[1:25:27] we don't we don't need to we don't need
[1:25:28] any of that because you know that's not
[1:25:30] going to benefit the body
[1:25:33] so we need to see what our we need to
[1:25:35] find out what our part is we need to
[1:25:36] find out what our position is what God
[1:25:38] is wanting us to do and if we'll do our
[1:25:41] part then we can be a benefit to
[1:25:42] everybody
[1:25:44] you know I was saying about so many
[1:25:46] times brother man I'm standing up and
[1:25:47] you know he would go to have a prayer
[1:25:49] line
[1:25:50] and you know here he is standing in the
[1:25:52] prayer line and he's standing behind the
[1:25:53] pulpit and he's he said well you know
[1:25:55] who I'm waiting on and he begins to
[1:25:57] speak so many times he began to speak
[1:25:59] of the of the Supernatural and he's
[1:26:01] began to speak about things taking place
[1:26:03] but he always tells them listen you
[1:26:06] don't have to come across this platform
[1:26:09] you don't need me to lay hands on you
[1:26:12] he said you don't have to come to a to a
[1:26:14] a Revival you don't have to go to
[1:26:16] brother Roberts's meetings or A.A Allen
[1:26:19] or somebody else you don't have to go
[1:26:20] and have have lay them lay hands on you
[1:26:23] how many times did he say up he said
[1:26:25] your pastor if he's ordained of God to
[1:26:28] preach the gospel he can lay hands on
[1:26:30] you he said you don't need somebody else
[1:26:32] he said if you're a child of God you can
[1:26:34] lay hands on people you don't have to
[1:26:36] wait on somebody else why because you've
[1:26:38] been given that commission that's your
[1:26:40] part
[1:26:42] how many you know when brother Brown
[1:26:43] speaking of that that young lady that
[1:26:45] was the the mother that was there and
[1:26:47] you know she was holding that baby and
[1:26:49] she had a prayer card but that God laid
[1:26:51] it upon that woman's heart to pray for
[1:26:52] that baby and sit there and you know she
[1:26:54] couldn't get away from that why because
[1:26:56] God had given her a commission had given
[1:26:58] her something to do now she had every
[1:27:01] reason in the world why she shouldn't do
[1:27:03] that
[1:27:04] and she battled that in her mind
[1:27:07] so well you know brother Bam's gonna
[1:27:09] pray for I don't know why but you know
[1:27:10] what God wouldn't let her away from that
[1:27:13] let her free of that why because he
[1:27:15] wanted her to do something
[1:27:18] and he began to speak to you do this
[1:27:21] and so what can I hold the baby and then
[1:27:24] she was holding sister do you mind if I
[1:27:26] pray for it said the Lord's not just
[1:27:28] going to let he's not going to let me
[1:27:29] free of this thing until I do this
[1:27:32] he said what's your sister go ahead
[1:27:34] and you know she she give up her seat
[1:27:36] she prayed for the baby she wouldn't go
[1:27:38] sit in the balcony
[1:27:39] and here's brother random standing there
[1:27:41] and the angel Lord's standing there and
[1:27:42] you know all the all the Supernatural is
[1:27:45] working and the spirit of the Lord's
[1:27:47] moving there in the in the platform here
[1:27:48] she comes with the baby and brother
[1:27:50] random sees discerns the situation he's
[1:27:53] like you know what this Baby's already
[1:27:54] healed
[1:27:57] that sister up there in the balcony she
[1:27:59] was down here and she was she was over
[1:28:01] there and she prayed for the baby
[1:28:03] and said the Lord held it when she
[1:28:04] prayed
[1:28:06] she didn't have to wait on me to pray
[1:28:07] because she took care of it because God
[1:28:09] gave her
[1:28:10] the unction to do that
[1:28:13] and said listen said she done that why
[1:28:15] because she was a mother and she could
[1:28:19] enter in
[1:28:20] she could enter in for that child he
[1:28:23] said maybe I could wouldn't have been
[1:28:24] able to
[1:28:26] but that woman could because she's a
[1:28:28] mother
[1:28:30] and what was it it was showing it was
[1:28:32] showing how significant that God is and
[1:28:35] how significant it is so important for
[1:28:37] us to be led by the spirit and listen to
[1:28:40] what God has called us to do and do that
[1:28:45] it doesn't make us big but it it makes
[1:28:47] us so so important in the in the body to
[1:28:50] do what God has called us to do
[1:28:53] you know you think you think of the you
[1:28:55] think of the the
[1:28:57] woman in Memphis the sister in Memphis
[1:29:01] here she is standing there with a dying
[1:29:03] son
[1:29:04] in this little room you know this little
[1:29:06] Shack down in the back skirts of Memphis
[1:29:09] and you know she may not have anything
[1:29:11] but you know what she knew who God was
[1:29:13] she knew she knew who to get in touch
[1:29:15] with
[1:29:16] and here you know it's so amazing when
[1:29:18] you begin to to read the the story of
[1:29:21] that is as she you know brother
[1:29:22] branham's there and all of a sudden
[1:29:24] brother Brown was flying by in a plane
[1:29:26] all of a sudden God grounds that plane
[1:29:28] in Memphis
[1:29:30] hey you know he spends the night he gets
[1:29:32] up mails his letters and the Lord begins
[1:29:35] to speak to him and tell him
[1:29:37] you need to leave you need to go
[1:29:39] begins to lead him and he's like you
[1:29:42] know he goes stands in the window you
[1:29:43] know looking at the cop and he's looking
[1:29:45] in the window and he's praying the Lord
[1:29:46] is that you is this what you want me to
[1:29:48] do
[1:29:50] and all of a sudden the Lord's telling
[1:29:52] him keep walking
[1:29:54] you keep walking
[1:29:56] so he starts walking down through there
[1:29:59] I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them
[1:30:03] here he is he keeps walking he keeps
[1:30:05] walking he keeps walking
[1:30:08] brother Andre said he walked about four
[1:30:09] or five miles I don't know
[1:30:12] I know there's I know it was quite a
[1:30:13] waste but he just kept walking
[1:30:16] here he's just walking along walking
[1:30:17] along
[1:30:20] he didn't know where he was going
[1:30:23] but he's seen that black sister sitting
[1:30:25] down there by the fence
[1:30:27] rag tied around her head
[1:30:30] standing there
[1:30:32] went from the Dew
[1:30:36] she was standing there you know what her
[1:30:38] come her answer
[1:30:41] brother remember didn't know what he was
[1:30:43] doing but she did
[1:30:45] when he walked by good morning Parson
[1:30:48] let me tell you what
[1:30:50] I bet she felt like she wasn't even
[1:30:51] touching the ground
[1:30:54] she got to tell brother Branham you know
[1:30:56] what's so amazing about that story
[1:30:59] I'm sure I'm sure y'all y'all have heard
[1:31:00] this before but what's so amazing about
[1:31:02] that story
[1:31:03] Elisha was standing there one day and he
[1:31:05] was out there and he said yonder's at
[1:31:07] schumanite woman and she's coming
[1:31:09] and the Lord has kept it from me
[1:31:12] what her need is but here she comes but
[1:31:15] he knew she was troubled but he didn't
[1:31:16] know what her problem was
[1:31:18] and here comes brother Brown in the same
[1:31:20] way she said I'm just like that
[1:31:22] shumanite woman he said where is Elijah
[1:31:26] she was looking for him here he come go
[1:31:28] walking down through there she knew what
[1:31:30] was going to take place
[1:31:33] when she began to speak say when geeza
[1:31:37] goes down there and says his all well is
[1:31:38] the family all right is your son all is
[1:31:40] well
[1:31:41] all is well everything's okay but you
[1:31:43] know what she went and grabbed a hold of
[1:31:45] the feet of the prophet
[1:31:46] she got a hold of him
[1:31:48] brother I didn't know where he was going
[1:31:50] Elijah didn't know where he was going he
[1:31:51] didn't know what was going to take place
[1:31:53] but all of a sudden it was made known
[1:31:58] and he and he says
[1:32:00] said
[1:32:02] Auntie do you know my name I'm I'm
[1:32:04] Reverend Bradham I'm I'm a I pray for
[1:32:07] the sick
[1:32:08] no Morrison I've never heard of you
[1:32:11] I'm just seeking the salvation of my son
[1:32:15] he's dying and he needs salvation
[1:32:19] that's what I want he's out he thinks
[1:32:21] he's lost on the sea and he needs he
[1:32:23] needs salvation
[1:32:25] and in the midst of all that is he was
[1:32:27] down there and he didn't know where he
[1:32:28] was at didn't know what was going to
[1:32:29] take place
[1:32:30] but he stood there that night and it's
[1:32:32] that day and he was standing there
[1:32:35] and he walked in that little house
[1:32:37] and he said I went into King's palaces
[1:32:39] and all those you know the the great
[1:32:41] rich man's places he said but not a
[1:32:43] house like that
[1:32:46] and he said he said he said he said
[1:32:48] Auntie pray you pray first
[1:32:51] and they said man let me tell you what
[1:32:52] if it's anybody
[1:32:54] ever talk to the Lord that woman knew
[1:32:57] who God was
[1:32:59] to know that brother Brandon was coming
[1:33:02] what he looked like he had a satchel all
[1:33:04] the things brother man didn't know where
[1:33:05] he was going
[1:33:06] but he was following the leading of the
[1:33:08] Lord
[1:33:09] come in the house and man I was prayer
[1:33:12] went down that night that day
[1:33:15] and then all of a sudden he just put his
[1:33:16] hands on that boy's feet and he said
[1:33:18] Lord I don't know why I'm here don't
[1:33:19] even know where I'm supposed to be said
[1:33:21] the plane's probably already gone by now
[1:33:24] but he laid hands on that man that boy's
[1:33:26] feet
[1:33:28] and he began to pray Lord I don't know
[1:33:31] but this boy needs needs a touch from
[1:33:33] you
[1:33:34] you've seen this woman's desire
[1:33:37] brought me all this way I don't know if
[1:33:39] this is it Lord but I'm praying for this
[1:33:41] young man because he definitely needs a
[1:33:43] touch
[1:33:44] as he began to pray
[1:33:46] not knowing everything but just
[1:33:48] following the leading of the spirit then
[1:33:51] all of a sudden that voice starts
[1:33:52] yelling oh Mama it's getting light in
[1:33:55] here
[1:33:55] it's getting light in here it's getting
[1:33:58] light in here they said by the time he
[1:34:00] got ready to walk out that young man was
[1:34:01] sitting on the side of the bed
[1:34:03] and he took off running
[1:34:05] trying to get to the airport
[1:34:07] and you know what he was so worried you
[1:34:09] know well I'm about to figure out how
[1:34:10] I'm gonna get home now that plane's
[1:34:12] probably already gone
[1:34:14] you know I played and stayed grounded
[1:34:15] that whole time
[1:34:18] off of one woman's face
[1:34:22] some insignificant woman but you know
[1:34:25] what God was mindful of her and it went
[1:34:28] all that way
[1:34:30] yeah and brothers and sisters it's the
[1:34:31] same thing with you and I
[1:34:33] when when brother random was standing
[1:34:35] there in the prayer lines and he began
[1:34:36] to speak what was it what was he trying
[1:34:38] to do he was trying to build people's
[1:34:41] Faith trying to get people to understand
[1:34:42] Jesus Christ is here he is here right
[1:34:46] now to meet your needs
[1:34:48] but you know what he's the same one that
[1:34:51] promised it back there the same one that
[1:34:54] walked on the sea of Gala the shores of
[1:34:56] Galilee all those things are written in
[1:34:59] the Bible he's the same one tonight he's
[1:35:01] standing here tonight to meet your needs
[1:35:03] to lead whatever you have need of he's
[1:35:05] here
[1:35:08] and you know all those all of those
[1:35:09] stories that he told to build their to
[1:35:11] build the people's faith
[1:35:14] wanting you to realize who you are and
[1:35:16] what you can do
[1:35:18] greater is he that's in you
[1:35:22] than he that's in the world
[1:35:24] and you know your testimony is a is a
[1:35:27] bill is a faith Builder to everyone else
[1:35:31] we hear that you know when you know and
[1:35:33] I I like I told my brother Andres you
[1:35:35] know sometimes we have testimonies and
[1:35:37] you know sometimes the the Lord
[1:35:40] you know sometimes we just feel an
[1:35:41] unction to we need to get up and testify
[1:35:45] but you know sometimes well I
[1:35:47] I don't know
[1:35:51] you know and sometimes sometimes we need
[1:35:53] to get up and give God praise
[1:35:55] we need to thank God for what he's done
[1:35:58] to know what God has done in our lives
[1:36:01] when we when we've seen Miracles just
[1:36:04] like you know I think about sister Freda
[1:36:06] and different ones you know when the
[1:36:07] Lord Has Come and touched you and done
[1:36:09] miracles in your life then you know what
[1:36:10] you need to get up and tell everybody
[1:36:12] that
[1:36:14] well because why because the same one
[1:36:23] and he's here to meet your needs
[1:36:27] or wherever you are you say Lord I need
[1:36:29] I need to be
[1:36:31] you know we we
[1:36:33] think about what is brother Dale's
[1:36:36] brother Wayne's been preaching
[1:36:38] on the Statue of a perfect man
[1:36:42] and you start to come up and say you
[1:36:43] know I'm lacking on these things
[1:36:46] I come to the plate you know why because
[1:36:47] God that's that's the grace of God in
[1:36:49] our lives to speak to us to realize you
[1:36:51] know what you're not where you need to
[1:36:52] be
[1:36:53] when you when you come to the
[1:36:55] realization you know what I need more
[1:36:56] virtue I need more knowledge I need more
[1:36:59] Temperance I need more patience
[1:37:01] I need more godliness
[1:37:04] well then you know what when he starts
[1:37:06] to call out to you and identify listen
[1:37:08] you're short there you're short there
[1:37:11] then you know what then he's all because
[1:37:12] he's doing that for you to realize it's
[1:37:14] time for you to come and there's more
[1:37:16] for you to receive
[1:37:18] because you're coming through these
[1:37:20] things because he's trying to build
[1:37:21] these things these these carry this
[1:37:23] character these virtues in you
[1:37:27] and sometimes sometimes we wonder why
[1:37:30] things come our way why because we don't
[1:37:32] see the end result
[1:37:35] the trying of our faith is more precious
[1:37:38] than gold
[1:37:41] how wonderful what a loving God
